<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE it hath plea&s;ed the Mo&s;t High, thro' the Riches of his free Grace, to give a poor &s;inful Worm, &s;ome Acquaintance with him&s;elf, thro' the Revelatian of his written Word; and by the &s;ame Word &s;ome Under&s;tand|ing of the Affairs of his vi&s;ible Kingdom&mdash; In &s;ome Mea&s;ure to know what are the ju&s;t Rights and Privileges belonging to the Church and People of God. And by this Knowledge, I tru&s;t, that I am put into a Circum&s;tance to form a proper and right Judgment of the&s;e Times, or the pre&s;ent State of this Colony: And if I mi&s;take not, the People of this Colony have gone off from the Word of God, in their Prac|tice in religious Matters; and adopted in the Room of God's Word, as a Rule of Practice in the Affairs of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible Kingdom, their own hu|man Inventions, as this Book will di&s;cover. And what gives me Countenance &amp; fortify's my Mind with Courage and Boldne&s;s to confront the whole Colony, (Rulers and Mini&s;ters) is not that I think my Abilities is any Ways equal with their's. No, I am far from &s;uch a Thought. But it is from a full Satisfaction that the Cau&s;e that I have undertook in, is good, and the Lord's Cau&s;e; and that it has been by his Direction
<PB N="iv" REF="010621_0003_0F81BA65E6A7EB78">
and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Main, that I have gone through what the following Sheets make mani|fe&s;t.&mdash;A Per&s;on with &s;mall Abilities, pre&s;erved in the Fear of the Lord, in a good Cau&s;e,&mdash;has the Advantage of one va&s;tly &s;uperior to him in Abilities, that takes up on the wrong or bad Side, as doubtle&s;s this Book will make manife&s;t.</P>
<P>But had the Author of the Explanation of Say-Brook Platform, or &s;ome equal to him in Abilities, &s;ubmitted their Powers to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in this his Cau&s;e; doubtle&s;s Points would have been handled, and Things laid open more to the Acceptance and Satisfaction of the People than what they are now done. But how &s;uch Men, &s;o prepared by their Creator, to do &s;ingu|lar Service for their great Lord and Ma&s;ter, will an&s;wer for their criminal Silence in Chri&s;t's Cau&s;e, in the Things which this Book treats up|on, is for them timely to con&s;ider. For I am bound in Charity to believe, that tho&s;e that de|ny eccle&s;ia&s;tical Councils having Right to give Rules and Laws for Con&s;cience, or u&s;urp over the Church and People of God, mu&s;t al&s;o deny civil Ruler's exerci&s;ing the &s;ame Power; and that the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws of this Colony, denies Liberty of Con&s;cience, and robs the Church of Chri&s;t of her &s;acred Rights and Privileges, I think cannot be deny'd. But tho&s;e that know the Truth, and will acquaint them&s;elves with &s;aid Laws, and the leading Men that &s;ee the&s;e Laws
<PB N="v" REF="010621_0004_0F81BA66808CDE80">
to be wrong, neglecting their Duty in taking proper Mea&s;ures to have the&s;e Laws removed out of the Way, &s;o as not to hurt the Church and People of God, has brought the Nece&s;&s;ity upon me, to venture to break the Ice, that Others of &s;uperior Abilities, may be happily in&s;trumental under God, to give the fini&s;hing Stroke, of removing every Thing, that is a Let out of the Way of the Church and People of God. The main Thing I have in View thro' the whole of this Book is, free Liberty of Con|&s;cience&mdash;the Right of thinking, choo&s;ing and act|ing for one's &s;elf in Matters of Religion, which re&s;pects God and Con&s;cience; and to contend earne&s;tly for this important Privilege, I, nor any other Per&s;on &s;hould not be a&s;hamed to do, co&s;t what it will:&mdash;if my Reader wilt acquaint him&s;elf with what it co&s;t our Godly Forefathers, that fir&s;t planted this Land, &amp; Colony, to e&s;tabli&s;h and enjoy the Liberty that this Book is pleading for, he will doubtle&s;s ju&s;tify me for this Per|formance; for my Reader may &s;ee Liberty of Con&s;cience in religious Matters, was the main and leading Point in View, in planting this Land and Colony. And this is acknowledged by the Compilers and E&s;tabli&s;hers of Say-Brook-Plan, &s;ee the Preface, Page 1. &mdash;<HI>"Among all which, this hath been peculiar unto; and to the di&s;tingui&s;hing Glory of that Tract, called New-England, that the Colonies
<PB N="vi" REF="010621_0005_0F81BA6730EC5290">
there were originally formed. Not for the Advantage of Trade and a worldly Intere&s;t; but upon the mo&s;t noble Foundation, even of Religion, and the Liberty of their Con|&s;ciences: with Re&s;pect unto the Ordinan|ces of the Go&s;pel, admini&s;tered in the Pu|rity and Power of them, a Happine&s;s then not to be enjoyed in their native Soil."</HI></P>
<P>Further writing of our Forefathers, what exerci&s;ed their Minds, in leaving England and coming into this Wilderne&s;s, &s;ay, Page 3. <HI>"That which they were mo&s;t &s;olicitous about, and wherein their Liberty had been re&s;trained, re&s;pecting the Wor&s;hip of God, and the Go|vernment of the Church of Chri&s;t, accord|ing to his own Appointment. Their Faith and Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion being the &s;ame which was generally received in all the Re|formed Churches of Europe."</HI></P>
<P>Now, hone&s;t Reader, &s;ee how exactly this Te&s;timony agrees with what this Book holds forth, and the Separates are contending for, it is not about Articles of Faith; but the Wor|&s;hip of God, and the Government of the Church, what re&s;pects Liberty of Con&s;cience, and prac|ti&s;ing in Religion. They that ju&s;tify our Fore|fathers in their contending for their Right, in Matters of Con&s;cience and Practice in Religion, and condemn the Separates, that have withdrew or de&s;ented from the con&s;ociated Churches of
<PB N="vii" REF="010621_0006_0F81BA678AE6CD50">
this Colony, and through the Knowledge of the Truth, &s;et up and organized Churches, may read their Character in Mat. 23, 29. to the End; for you condemn tho&s;e that per&s;ecuted and oppre&s;&s;ed our Godly Forefathers; and you your&s;elves are doing the &s;ame Things to the Se|parates, per&s;ecuting and oppre&s;&s;ing them, who are properly the &s;piritual Seed of our Godly Forefathers, and tread in the Main, in their Steps; as they walked according to the Word of God; and you poor Creatures, are to be pitied and prayed for, if &s;o be their may be Mercy for you, for you walk in the Steps of our Father's Per&s;ecutors. But upon the whole, if my La|bour in this Book, does not well agree or com|port with this Te&s;timony of our Forefathers Principles, and Practice in planting this Land; then Iprofe&s;s to &s;tand ready to retract my Mi&s;take, upon Conviction offered me; but otherwi&s;e, I think no Man ought to be offended with the following Performance; but rather to con&s;ider from whence we are fallen and repent, and put in practice the Coun&s;el and Advice I have given to all Ranks and Orders of Men in this Book.</P>
<P>Some of my Readers may think, that I have crowded too hard upon the Clergy in my Writ|ing. But if they will take the Pains to ac|quaint them&s;elves with the Scripture Character of the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and tho&s;e that are Hirelings, or that run, that God never &s;ent, &amp;c.
<PB N="viii" REF="010621_0007_0F81BA6A78E46848">
And compare the Body of the Mini&s;ters of this Religious Con&s;titution of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> with the&s;e Scripture Characters, they will doubtle&s;s &s;ee that my Ob&s;ervations are ju&s;t and &s;criptural. But I would recommend to my Readers, a Ser|mon upon this Head, from <HI>1</HI> Joh. <HI>1.4</HI> to <HI>6,</HI> upon the Tryal of the Spirits, by <HI>William Dell,</HI> Mi|ni&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, and Ma&s;ter of <HI>Gonvil Cai|us College,</HI> in <HI>Cambridge;</HI> excepting the Author's Opinion of Chri&s;t in the Believer: which I think is not &s;ound; al&s;o his not making a proper Di&s;tiction between the Spirit and the written Word of God, as a Rule, &amp;c. Al&s;o, &s;aying, the Believer is the only Book in which God him&s;elf writes his new Te&s;tament. The&s;e and &s;uch like Things, I recommend not. This Book was fir&s;t printed in the Year <HI>1666, Hartford,</HI> re-printed in the Year <HI>1766.</HI> Now, Reader, it is worth of &s;pecial Notice, how aptly this Sermon, printed a Hundred Years ago, di&s;|cribes our pre&s;ent Clergy in this Land. Surely this Author could not be prejudiced again&s;t our pre&s;ent Mini&s;ters, before they had any Being; however my Readers may think that I am, when I have done nothing, but what was done a Hundred Years ago in the &s;ame Nature, accord|ing to the Scriptures. But to clo&s;e this Preface, I freely &s;ubmit my&s;elif, and this Performance, to be tried by the Word of God, there to &s;tand or fall.</P>

<HEAD>The Author's Apology.</HEAD>
<P>IT is probable, that &s;ome will object a|gain&s;t the Performance, which the fol|lowing Sheets make manife&s;t, and &s;ay, that it is great Weakne&s;s in me, to pretend to appear again in public Print, &s;ince my for|mer Performance was &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed, and rejected by our good and learned Mi|ni&s;ters, and the Body of the People of Con|necticut: And more e&s;pecially, &s;ince my Book has been confuted, and the Errors of it laid open by &s;ub&s;tantial Pieces, written for that End, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, My principal or leading Mo|tive, in my former Writing (nor yet in this) was not, who, or how many &s;hould be con|vinced, nor yet how much Credit it would get among Mankind; either among the Learned or Unlearned; but principally to di&s;charge what I thought was my great Duty to God and Men, and unburden my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mind, and keep a cha&s;t Con&s;ci|ence to him that has Redeemed me by the infinite Price of his precious Blood. My ground Principle of Action in Duty, is not
<PB N="10" REF="010621_0009_0F81BA6B61087F48">
how much Succe&s;s or Pro&s;perity I &s;hall have in the Duty; but to get fruitful In|telligence in my Under&s;tanding, by God's Word and Providences, of what his Will is, in my Duty. This is enough to lay a &s;olid Foundation of Action; leaving the Event with Him that governs all Things accord|ing to the Councils of his own Will. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> my Divine Lord and Ma&s;ter did not con|vince the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, nor the Body of his Covenant People the Jews, that he was the Chri&s;t of God; nor prevail with them, to be truly religious; vain will it be for me; a poor &s;inful, imperfect Creature, to think to &s;ucceed, more than He who is the Wi&s;dom of God, and Perfect in all his Works and Ways. Yet notwith&s;tanding, I humbly apprehend, that it is my Duty to labour in Love to God and Souls&mdash;to offer that Truth which is &s;uitable to convince all rational Minds, (that are open and free to weigh Things according to their own Nature) what God's Will is, and Ways, and the Manner of his Working; as it re|&s;pects our Duty to God, and each other. And &s;o commit the Performance entirely to God's wi&s;e and righteous Di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to my Book's being confuted, and the Errors of it laid open; what is done of this Kind, that has not come to my Know|ledge,
<PB N="11" REF="010621_0010_0F81BA6C1A36A1E0">
I can have nothing to &s;ay. But that which I have &s;een, I have a ju&s;t Right to con&s;ider; which has been in three Pieces, wrote by three different Men. The fir&s;t, I think, was Mr. Bartlet's Sermon, from Gal. 3.1. The &s;econd, &s;ome &s;hort Remarks made by Friend Bowles, of New-London, the third, a laborious Piece, wrote by Mr. Ro&s;s of Stratfield, Intituled, "A plain Ad|dre&s;s to the Quakers, Moravians, Separates, Separate-Bapti&s;ts, Rogereens, and other Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, on immediate Impul&s;es, and Revelation," &amp;c.</P>
<P>As to the&s;e Three Men's treating me; to &s;peak the Truth of my Neighbour, Friend Bowles has treated me more like a Chri&s;tian, than Mr. Bartlet or Ro&s;s. For Friend Bowles took Pains to &s;end a Man on Purpo&s;e, (as the Man told me) up to Mid|dletown, from New-London, to know whe|ther he under&s;tood me right, in &s;ome Pa&s;|&s;ages in my Book, re&s;pecting what I meant by the Hou&s;e of God, and about the Sab|bath, and &s;ome other Words, &amp;c. &s;hewing a Di&s;po&s;ition to get my Mind, ju&s;t as I under&s;tood my&s;elf; which Conduct, &s;o far is commendable. But as to his Opinon a|bout the Sabbath, and the other Things he faulted me in; I not having his Piece by me; and being &s;atisfied that his wild No|tions
<PB N="12" REF="010621_0011_0F81BA6D300D3948">
about the Sabbath, and the Scriptures, are in a Circum&s;tance, that there is not the tenth Part of Danger, that Per&s;ons will be en&s;nared by him, as there is by Mr. Bartlet and Ro&s;s's Performance. There|fore I &s;hall leave Friend Bowles at this Time, with his own Opinion of Things, to &s;tand or fall to his own Ma&s;ter; and &s;ay, altho' Mr. Bartlet lives in the &s;ame Town, with me, and not &s;carce three Miles Di&s;|tance, yet he never &s;hewed the neighbour|ly or chri&s;tian Part to enquire, (like Friend Bowles) whether he had got my Mind, be|fore he publi&s;hed it. But I &s;hould not fault him here, if he had done Ju&s;tice to me, and the Truth, as it is written in my Book, which he has quoted to. The Rea&s;on why I did not write an An&s;wer to his Ser|mon, when it fir&s;t come from the Pre&s;s, was this, That all that under&s;tood experimental Religion, the E&s;&s;ence of a &s;aving Faith, of the Teachings of the Holy Gho&s;t, and care|fully read his Sermon, knew that there was nothing of Weight in it&mdash;A mere vain A|mu&s;ement to tickle and plea&s;e the Ears of the carnal World; and feed the Minds of the Enemies of God and his Cau&s;e! &s;o that the Sermon it&s;elf is &s;ufficient to &s;hew the falicy of it, to all fruitful di&s;cerning Chri&s;|tians, that I need not write a Word to un|cover
<PB N="13" REF="010621_0012_0F81BA6D9A977308">
it to &s;uch. And tho&s;e that are Mr. Bartlet's high Favorites, that do not exa|mine or &s;earch the Scriptutes for them|&s;elves, but take what he &s;ayeth as an Ori|cle. Now if I could write or preach the Mind of God, as perfect as the Apo&s;tles; &s;uch Per&s;ons, would likely reject the Truth di&s;pen&s;ed by me. That if it were not for a middle Sort of Per&s;ons, that are not &s;o tightly glewed to the Mini&s;ters, and yet have not attained to any great Clearne&s;s of dividing between Truth and Error; who have &s;ome Mind to try all Things, and to hold fa&s;t that which they them&s;elves un|der&s;tand to be according to Truth; I &s;hall have no need to reply a Word to the Ser|mon. But for their Sakes, and all that will labour calmly and uprightly to read Mr. Bartlet's Sermon and my Book, I &s;hall re|mark as followeth.</P>
<P N="1">1. Mr. Bartlet has made a &s;ad Mi&s;take, through the whole of his Sermon, which is common for all Per&s;ons to do, that are &s;o unhappy as to fall on the wrong Side of the Que&s;tion. He has begged the whole Mat|ter in Debate, for he has &s;ettled the Point, that he and his Confederates in the Mini|&s;try are right and their Churches; and never bro't a Scrap of Scripture or Rea&s;on to prove that they are &s;o. Whereas my Reader may
<PB N="14" REF="010621_0013_0F81BA6E6F53D840">
remember, that the whole Scope and Bur|then of my Book (which Mr. Bartlet con|demns) is to &s;hew the Contrary, both from Scripture and Rea&s;on, that the &s;tanding Mini&s;ters and Churches in this Colony are not practi&s;ing in the Rule of God's Word. Doubtle&s;s there are converted Men in the Mini&s;try, and converted Per&s;ons in their Churches, which we have &s;oberly di&s;&s;ented from. But we all profe&s;s to know, that converted Mini&s;ters or Church Members, is not the Rule of Faith or Practice in Re|ligion, but the written Word of God. Surely then had Mr. Bartlet acted wi&s;ely, and as a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, he would have &s;hewn to his Hearers or Readers, from the Scriptures that he and his Confederates was &s;peaking and walking according to the Law, and to the Te&s;timony; but he has not done it; and the Scriptures gives the Rea&s;on, I&s;a. 8, 20, "Becau&s;e there is no Light in them."</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It mu&s;t be allowed by all, that a Man to vindicate him&s;elf in any important Affair, will produce the be&s;t Evidence and Rea&s;on, that he is Ma&s;ter of, which I &s;up|po&s;e Mr. Bartlet has done. Therefore, let any proper Per&s;on that knows what the Work of a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t is, and that can di&s;tingui&s;h Truth from Error, read
<PB N="15" REF="010621_0014_0F81BA6F0E5FD710">
Mr. Bartlet's Sermon, and he may &s;ee that there is no Character nor Fruits of a Mi|ni&s;ter of Chri&s;t through all the Sermon. For a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t in his Perform|ance, will di&s;cover &s;ome experimental Ac|quaintance with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But his Sermon gives no Scripture Evi|dence, that he knows Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. A Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t di&s;covers an Acquaintance with the Work of the Spi|rit of God upon the Heart, in the whole of its Work upon the Sinner, till he is bro't to bow to the Foot of pure Ju&s;tice. Search Reader, and you may &s;ee, that Mr. Bartlet has not &s;hewn the Need of any Holy Spi|rit, (&s;carcely) nor pointed out his Work, in all his Sermon; indeed he has hardly intimated, that there is any Need of any Holy Gho&s;t in Religion.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. A Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t di&s;covers an Acquaintance with the New-Birth, John 3, 5. How the Work is wrought, and the Operation of God's Spirit upon the Heart, that is made holy, &amp; what the Exerci&s;e of the Mind is, that has Communion with God; al&s;o what are the Scripture Marks of Growth in Grace, and Heart Holine&s;s. All which Mr. Bartlet has left out of his Sermon.&mdash; And why?&mdash;Whether it was his Zeal a|gain&s;t me, made him forget the E&s;&s;ence of
<PB N="16" REF="010621_0015_0F81BA6FD60D2828">
his Sermon; or his Want of experimental Acquaintance with the Holy Spirit's Work, before and after Conver&s;ion, or the Want of an Author at Hand, wrote through the Spirit's Help, to have borrowed &s;ome Mat|ter, &amp;c. I leave him to &s;ay.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Once more. A Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t experimentally knows what &s;aving Faith is; and that it is the Gift of God; al&s;o the Exerci&s;e of the Mind in the Soul's fir&s;t U|nion with Chri&s;t. But the Author has &s;een fit to deny the De&s;cription of the E&s;&s;ence of a Saving Faith, which I have given in my Book, and to call me a Seducer, a Man of corrupt Mind, reprobate concerning the Faith; al&s;o that I am the Per&s;on de&s;cribed; 2 Pet. 2.1. "Who privily &s;hall bring in damnable Here&s;ies, even denying the Lord that bought them." See P. 50&mdash;53. And at the &s;ame Time, left his poor Hearers or Readers, without de&s;cribing what the E&s;|&s;ence of a Saving Faith is; through the Whole of his Di&s;cour&s;e, altho' the Subject Matter naturally led thereto; for there can be no Go&s;pel-Obedience to the Truth with|out &s;aving Faith: And more e&s;pecially, when he undertook to &s;hew the De&s;cripti|on that I gave, was corrupt, and &s;o con&s;e|quently Soul-damning. What criminal In|ju&s;tice is the Author guilty of, to leave his
<PB N="17" REF="010621_0016_0F81BA708C4B6A48">
Hearers without any Knowledge of the true Way? When does Providence call louder upon Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters, to de&s;cribe Saving Faith in the Love, Fruits and ge|nuine Effects of it, than when it is cor|ruptly &s;et forth by a &s;educing Teacher (as The Author calls me) and yet no De&s;cription of the true Faith held forth by him? Poor Souls, that &s;ubmit to &s;uch a blind Teacher! that after all the Noi&s;e your Teacher has made about your being &s;educed and cor|rupted in your Faith; his Labours among you give no Evidence that either he, or you have got any Faith, that will &s;tand your Souls in Stead, in the la&s;t Day. Neither are you ever like to come to the &s;av|ing Knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by &s;uch Improvements, through Time; for a Cart-Load of Sermons upon the Negative, will never produce the Po&s;itive, and Negative, Negative, is the Sum total of the Author's Sermon.</P>
<P N="6">6ly. In P. 50, and 51, the Author writing of me, &s;ayeth, "And &s;ince God in his holy Providence, has permitted &s;uch a Seducer," (with a marginal Note, &s;etting my Name at large in the Margin)
<Q>lately to make his Appearance among&s;t us; who comes in the Manner and with the Spirit of tho&s;e whom the Apo&s;tle cautions us not to
<PB N="18" REF="010621_0017_0F81BA71B6FDD5C8">
receive, 2 John 10, 11. And he who has been permitted to draw away &s;ome from their Steadfa&s;tne&s;s in the Order of the Go&s;pel; has one of the mo&s;t di&s;criminat|ing and di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks, which the Apo&s;tle gives of a &s;educing Teacher. 2 Tim. 3.8. Men of corrupt Minds, re|probate concerning the Faith; and that he is un&s;ound in the Faith, appears in his printed Book, in which many Er|rors are contained, and among others, one that &s;hews the Faith that he holds, is not the Faith of the Go&s;pel, as it &s;tands in his Book, Page 114, where he de&s;|cribes a Saving Faith thus, That it is the a&s;&s;enting to, and receiving Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for what he is in him&s;elf, and not for what he has done for the Creature. Now this De&s;cription of Faith excludes the Satisfaction, if not the whole Mediation of Chri&s;t, out of the E&s;&s;ence of &s;aving Faith.</Q>
Thus the Author writes of me &amp; my de&s;cribing the E&s;&s;ence of a &s;aving Faith. And in Page 53. ranks me with the wor&s;t of Hereticks. But I read, the Cur&s;e cau&s;e|le&s;s &s;hall not come; al&s;o the Wicked is &s;nared in the Work of his own Hands&mdash; and let his Net that he hath hid, catch him&s;elf&mdash;into that very De&s;truction let him fall, P&s;alm 9.16. and 35, 8. Therefore,
<PB N="19" REF="010621_0018_0F81BA721F32CD18">
Reader, be plea&s;ed carefully to con&s;ider what I have wrote; which the Author takes to be &s;uch damnable Here&s;y, which you may find in my Book, Page 115, 116, the whole Pa&s;&s;age is as followeth,
<Q>One Rea&s;on why &s;ome Per&s;ons oppo&s;e us in our declaring again&s;t this doubting, is from a Conceit they have, that we hold Doubting a Sin, place the E&s;&s;ence of &s;aving Faith, in a Knowledge that we are converted: But this is their Mi&s;take; for we hold, that the E&s;&s;ence of a &s;aving Faith, is the Soul's a&s;&s;enting to, and receiving Je&s;us Chri&s;t for what he is in him&s;elf, and not for what he hath done for the Creature; for many a Time a Believer has &s;uch a Di&s;covery of Chri&s;t, in his Glory and Excellency, that all the Faculties of the Soul, go forth in the receiving of him in his Fullne&s;s, with an immortal Thir&s;t, be|gotten by the Spirit of God, to be made completely holy, as he &s;ees God is holy&punc; and at that Moment he may not have one Thought what Frame he is in, or what God has implanted in his Heart. But u&s;ually upon &s;uch a Di&s;covery, the &s;ame Spirit of God that led out the Soul to receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for what he is in him&s;elf, di&s;covers to the Soul what Grace and Actings of Grace, God has implanted
<PB N="20" REF="010621_0019_0F81BA72D03229F8">
in the Heart, according to what we read, 1 Cor. 2.12,</Q>
&amp;c. Thus it is expre&s;&s;ed in my Book, and purpo&s;ly, to remove the Mi&s;take, that &s;ome had got of our Opini|on of &s;aving Faith, &s;uppo&s;ing that we held the E&s;&s;ence of a &s;aving Faith, to believe that we was converted, or that Chri&s;t loved us in particular, or that our Sins was par|doned, &amp;c. all which is contrary to our O|pinion, and well agrees with the Author's Opinion of Faith, oppo&s;ite to mine.&mdash;For con&s;ider the Word E&s;&s;ence; it is that which con&s;titutes the peculiar Nature of any Thing, and makes it to be what it is, and without which it cannot be. Therefore the Author's denying my De&s;cription of the E&s;&s;ence of a &s;aving Faith; and comment|ing upon it, as he has done in two or three Pages, plainly holds forth, that a Per&s;on that has the E&s;&s;ence of a &s;aving Faith, mu&s;t have a fruitful Under&s;tanding of the Offices of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and al&s;o A&s;&s;urance of his Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t's Favor, or that his Sins is pardoned; &s;o that A&s;&s;urance is brought into the E&s;&s;ence. Al&s;o, that there can be no &s;aving Faith without A&s;&s;urance. This is contrary to the Scriptures, John 14. and all &s;ound Divines that ever I read. For if a Sinner, in his fir&s;t clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t, does not except him for what he is in him&s;elf,
<PB N="21" REF="010621_0020_0F81BA738B3D3668">
but for what he has done for him; then it followeth, that he mu&s;t know what Chri&s;t has done for him, before he has the E&s;&s;ence of &s;aving Faith; which brings the Per&s;on to have A&s;&s;urance before he has the E&s;&s;ence. And I &s;uppo&s;e this will not &s;uit the Author: Yet I think this mu&s;t be the genuine Im|provement of his Remarks upon my De&s;|cription of Faith.&mdash;For con&s;ider where the pinching Point is, viz. and not for what he has done for the Creature. Note this <HI>not,</HI> is the Difficulty&punc; And why? Becau&s;e it excludes all legal Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Self and Selfi&s;hne&s;s, out of the Que&s;tion, in the Per&s;on's excepting and clo&s;ing with Je&s;us Chri&s;t. My De&s;cription of the E&s;|&s;ence of a &s;aving Faith, plainly &s;uppo&s;es a regenerating Work of God's Spirit upon the Per&s;on that thus acts, Faith upon the Son of God; and that the Per&s;on, in di|vine Scripture Light, beholds that in Je&s;us Chri&s;t that is infinitely excellent in it&s;elf; ei|ther divine Wi&s;dom, Power, Ju&s;tice, Truth, Purity, Holine&s;s; or high, deep and bound|le&s;s Mercy; all which attracts the Soul with Delight, Union and Complacency, all which is intirely one Side the Con&s;ideration (at this Time) of what is done to, or for the Per&s;on; neither is the Per&s;on, at this Time, concerned about going to Hell, but is in|tirely
<PB N="22" REF="010621_0021_0F81BA769212BD50">
taken up in what he beholds, out of him&s;elf, in another, even Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or &s;ome of his glorious Perfections; in which View, he is &s;urrounded with the &s;weet Awe of God, divine Peace and Serenity of Soul, at the Foot of pure Ju&s;tice &s;atisfied, and in &s;ome Mea&s;ure happified. Yea, tho&s;e Perfections of God, which &s;truck Terror and racking Di&s;tre&s;s upon the Per&s;on, while under the Law, now are the Delight, and great Satisfaction of the Soul, being in U|nion therewith. And all this is a one Side the Con&s;ideration of any Thing done for the Per&s;on; and is di&s;covered in the Word of God, which I call the E&s;&s;ence of a &s;aying Faith. But it is the further Work of the Spirit of God, through and by his written Word, to enlighten and inform the Under|&s;tanding of the Per&s;on, what is wrought in him, and done for him, and to in&s;truct him into the My&s;tery of the Per&s;onality of the Trinity; to di&s;tingui&s;h the Offices of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. In which Knowledge the Believer grows through Time, and ia a va&s;t Eterni|ty: But does not properly belong to the E&s;&s;ence of &s;aving Faith; becau&s;e &s;aving Faith is wrought in the Heart, before this fruitful, exten&s;ive Knowledge, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. Let our Attention be to the very Expre&s;&s;ions them&s;elves, and &s;ee whether
<PB N="23" REF="010621_0022_0F81BA77F997E198">
the Author had any ju&s;t Cau&s;e to write as he has in Page 50, to 53. Ob&s;erve,
<Q>For we hold that the E&s;&s;ence of a &s;aving Faith is the Soul's a&s;&s;enting to, and re|ceiving Je&s;us Chri&s;t for what he is in him&s;elf, and not for what he has done for the Creature.</Q>
Now had I have placed God, the Per&s;on of the Father, as the fir&s;t Object of Faith, the Author might have had &s;ome Colour to &s;uppo&s;e that I was an Ari|an or Socinian. But in as much as I have placed Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;ole Object of Faith, as he is God-Man, and &s;o the only Media|tor between God and fallen, &s;inful Man, there can be no Cau&s;e for his Oppo&s;ition. For con&s;ider the Soul, a&s;&s;enting to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, mu&s;t imply &s;omething di&s;covered in him, worthy of Approbation and Choice. Al&s;o, the receiving Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for what he is in him&s;elf, mu&s;t imply the Submi&s;&s;ion and full Con&s;ent of the Will, with the cha&s;te Em|bracing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with the Affections: And how is it po&s;&s;ible for this to be done, unle&s;s Je&s;us Chri&s;t is received e&s;&s;entially in all his Offices, as a Savior? for I under&s;tand the proper Meaning of the Word Je&s;us, is the Savior, and the Word Chri&s;t, is the A|nointed Son of God, or the Anointed Sa|vior. Which Expre&s;&s;ions contain all that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is, in this Gift of God the Fa|ther,
<PB N="24" REF="010621_0023_0F81BA7878F53510">
to a lo&s;t World, or to the Soul that truly receives him, as offered in the Go&s;|pel. So that all that can be &s;uppo&s;ed that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is to a Sinner, in all his Offices, mu&s;t be implied and contained in a Per|&s;on's receiving Je&s;us Chri&s;t as I have ex|pre&s;&s;ed. That upon the Whole, what the Author is plea&s;ed to call Here&s;y, and &s;o &s;oul-ruining, I &s;oberly &amp; &s;olemnly believe to be according to &s;ound Doctrine, and &s;oul-&s;a|ving, according to the Experience of all the Godly that ever was, is, or &s;hall be till Chri&s;t's &s;econd Coming. I will cite a Pa&s;|&s;age out of two godly Authors, Dr. Ames, in a Book entituled Con&s;cience, with the Power and Ca&s;e thereof. Chap. 10, of Love towards God.
<Q>Que&s;t. 1. Whether is God to be loved for his Goodne&s;s and Per|fection in it&s;elf con&s;idered, or for his Goodne&s;s towards us, and Benefits con|ferr'd upon us?&mdash;An&s;. 1. The mo&s;t perfect Kind of Love &s;tands in this, that we love God for him&s;elf; that is, that the formal Rea&s;on of our Love being (as the Schoolmen &s;peak) the lovely Na|ture of God, and that our Love be car|ried towards him as towards the la&s;t End. 1&s;t, Becau&s;e that Love is perfect. 2. Becau&s;e if we love God, only for his Goodne&s;s towards us, then we love him
<PB N="25" REF="010621_0024_0F81BA78D72F39F8">
for our&s;elves, and &s;o we love our&s;elves more than God.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. Mr. Edwards writes as follows, &s;hewing the Sign of gracious Affections, Page 134.
<Q>2. The fir&s;t objective Ground of graci|ous Affections, is the tran&s;cendently ex|cellent and amiable Nature of divine Things, as they are in them&s;elves, and not any conceived Relation they bear to Self, or Self-Intere&s;t.&mdash;"Page 135. "A Change made in the Views of his Mind, and Reli&s;h of his Heart, whereby he apprehends a Beauty, Glory, and &s;upreme Good in God's Nature, as it is in it&s;elf. This may be the Thing that fir&s;t draws his Heart to him, and cau&s;es his Heart to be united to him, prior to all Con&s;i|derations of his own Intere&s;t or Happi|ne&s;s, although after this, and as a Fruit of this, he nece&s;&s;arily &s;eeks his In|tere&s;t and Happine&s;s in God"&mdash;Page 136. This infinite Excellency of the divine Nature, as it is in it&s;elf, is the true Ground of all that is good in God, in any Re|&s;pect. But how can a Man truly and rightly love God, without loving him for that Excellency in him, which is the Foundation of all that is in any Manner of Re&s;pect, good or de&s;ireable in him? They who&s;e Affections to God is found|ed,
<PB N="26" REF="010621_0025_0F81BA79947503C8">
fir&s;t on his Profitablene&s;s to them, their Affections begins at the wrong End; they regard God only for the ut|mo&s;t Limits of the Stream of divine Good, where it touches them and reaches their Intere&s;t;&mdash;" Page 139. "Where|as the Exerci&s;es of true and holy Love in the Saints ari&s;e in another Way. They don't fir&s;t &s;ee that God loves them, and then &s;ee that he is lovely. But they fir&s;t &s;ee that God is lovely, and that Chri&s;t is excellent and glorious; and their Hearts are fir&s;t captivated with this View, and the Exerci&s;es of their Love, are wont from Time to Time to begin here, and to ri&s;e primarily from the&s;e Views; and then con&s;equently they &s;ee God's Love, and great Favor to them,</Q>
&amp;c. Thus writes the&s;e Authors, and well agrees with the De&s;cription that I have given of the E&s;&s;ence of a &s;aving Faith, which I wrote Years before I read the&s;e Authors. But to return, and &s;ay, as to the re&s;t of the Errors, which the Author &s;ayeth is in my Book, I &s;hall leave, till he is &s;o kind, as to tell me what they be; for I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the Spirit, and Tem|per of Mind that governed in him in this Affair, led him to take Notice of that which was mo&s;t gro&s;s, and contrary to his Opini|on
<PB N="27" REF="010621_0026_0F81BA7A4CF12028">
of &s;aving Faith; yet it appears to all Chri&s;tians, to be &s;ound Doctrine (as I tru&s;t and believe.) Had the Author placed his own Name in the Room of mine, he would no Doubt, have made a right Application of his negative Performance. But I mean to write in Soberne&s;s; for Soul-Blood is heavy Blood to account for. My Heart has been in Pain for the Author, and the poor, peri&s;hing People under his Charge. I have not altered my Opinion of the Au|thor's &s;tanding for more than twenty Years. I have been informed by his Hearers, that he oppo&s;ed the Work of God's Spirit, ever &s;ince the glorious and ble&s;&s;ed Work of God in the Year 1740, 1741, and &s;o down to this Day of Reformation. Whitefield, that wonderful In&s;trument that God has improv|ed for great Good to Souls&mdash;I have been informed he has called him a Deceiver and Impo&s;ter.&mdash;And it is ea&s;y for all that knew Whitefield and his Religion, to know the Author's Standing; which calls for the Bowels of Pity and &s;trong Cries to God for him, that he may not die with the Blood of his Hearers in his Skirts.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Piece was prepared for the Pre&s;s, &s;everal Months before Mr. Bartlet's Death</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2ly. I &s;hall proceed to take &s;ome Notice of
<PB N="28" REF="010621_0027_0F81BA7B120FC780">
Mr. Ro&s;s's Performance, as before menti|oned. (A plain Addre&s;s to the Quakers, Moravians, Separati&s;ts, Separate-Bapti&s;ts, Rogereens, and other Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, &amp;c.) But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that his Performance is &s;uch, that it is difficult to make any other Reply than a general one, by Rea&s;on that he has been &s;o unchri&s;tian-like in his treating of me, to rank me among a Number of Per&s;ons and Profe&s;&s;ions that I &s;tand no more in Connection with, than he him&s;elf; and never point me to any Thing that I hold in Principle or Practice, counter to the Word of God, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I think, Mr. Ro&s;s, quite forgot in his Performance, the Apo&s;tle Paul's Cau|tion, Rom. 2.21. "Thou therefore which teacheth Another, teache&s;t thou not thy|&s;elf? Thou that preache&s;t, a Man &s;hould not &s;teal, do&s;t thou &s;teal?" &amp;c. for he has charged the Separates almo&s;t with every Thing, but what is good, in his Book; in&s;inuating to the Public, as though we was &s;ome of the wilde&s;t Sort of Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, &s;et|ting as a Scarecrow in the Front of his Book, an Account of the Dutartres, and the Life of John Lewis; which Accounts are ve|ry &s;hocking In&s;tances of dreadful Delu&s;i|ons. And then, through the main of his Book, has di&s;covered a great Zeal without
<PB N="29" REF="010621_0028_0F81BA7BD3AC7408">
Knowledge; and has a&s;&s;erted &s;ome Things of the Separates, which is not true; and applyed the whole of his Performance wrong, as to the &s;eparate Teachers, and their Churches; yet, at the &s;ame Time pretends to be a Man of God, an In&s;tructor of the deluded and ignorant, when his Book gives him no &s;uch a Character.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, Reader, is it not rea&s;onable that Mr. Ro&s;s &s;hould prove that the Sepa|rates are guilty of the many Errors that he has charged them with, in his Book? Whereas he has done Nothing to prove his Charges, but his own bold A&s;&s;ertion, or the bare A&s;&s;ertion of &s;ome others in the like Pre&s;umption with him&s;elf. Chri&s;t di|rects us as in Mat. 7.12. "Therefore, all Things what&s;oever ye would that Men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.&mdash; How har&s;h and unchri&s;tian-like &s;hould I be to Mr. Ro&s;s, to charge him with being an Arian, becau&s;e there is &s;ome in the King|dom; or that he was a Dei&s;t, becau&s;e that there was &s;ome in the Colony; or that he was a Drunkard, or Thief, becau&s;e &s;ome that waited upon his Mini&s;try was &s;o, &amp; he innocent of the&s;e Things. This Metephor I think, fairly repre&s;ents Mr. Ro&s;s's Con|duct to me, and my Brethren, in this Re|formation.
<PB N="30" REF="010621_0029_0F81BA7C8AFAA758">
And if he &s;hould &s;ee the&s;e Lines, I would entreat him to compare his Conduct with the Text cited.</P>
<P N="3">3d. In Page 28, the Author has ranked Elder Pain, and my&s;elf, with Others that I know Nothing about, and quited a Pa&s;&s;age out of &s;ome Author&mdash;but what Author I know not.&mdash;He has not fixed any Name to it, that his Readers may think, that I or Elder Paine was the Author of that Quotation. Part of which is as followeth,
<Q>That though the Scriptures contain a full and &s;ufficient Declaration of Chri&s;tian Doctrine, yet they do not contain the whole Will of God, which is nece&s;&s;ary for us to know,</Q>
&amp;c. This Opinion I hold to be corrupt, as well as the Author; for I hold that the written Word of God is the alone, and only Rule of Faith and Practice, and contains all that is need|full for us to know in Time, to fit us for a happy Eternity; &s;o this Charge again&s;t us falls through for Want of Proof.</P>
<P>Again, in Page 40, the Author, by the Margin Note, has ranked me with Enthu|&s;ia&s;ts and Dei&s;ts, which, when I read, bro't to my Mind a zealous Mini&s;ter's Ob&s;erva|tion upon my Book (as I was informed) viz. that there was not a Word of Divinity in it. His Deacon reply'd, if there is not a Word
<PB N="31" REF="010621_0030_0F81BA7DC70DF820">
of Divinity in it, there is a great Deal of Scripture in it. So I mu&s;t reply to my Antagoni&s;t, with the Deacon, If I am a Dei&s;t, my Book has a great Deal of Scrip|ture in it, for it was upon the Scriptures I founded my Principles, and vindicated my Arguments to prove the &s;ame. Had the Author been vindicating the Truth, or the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, as he vainly pretends, it appears to me it would been his proper Work to have cited his Readers to the Pa|ges in my Book, where tho&s;e dreadful Er|rors are (if to be found) that he charges me with. It cannot be denied but that I have u&s;ed the Scriptures frequently in my Book, to vindicate what I call and firmly believe to be the Cau&s;e of God. Therefore, he &s;hould have &s;hewn where I preverted the Scripture, and applied them wrong. But Nothing of this is done. If he thinks that it is a gone Ca&s;e with me, as he intimates in the Beginning of his Book; yet I would charitably hope, that he does not think that to be the Ca&s;e with all that read my Book. Therefore he &s;hould have cited his Readers to my Errors, that he has loaded me with, to &s;ave them from being de&s;troyed by me; unle&s;s he concludes that his Readers has no Right to hear and try Things, Prin|ciples and Doctrines for them&s;elves;
<PB N="32" REF="010621_0031_0F81BA7E2BE49280">
but are obliged to take all from his bold A&s;&s;ertion, as an Oracle; which, I think, is the whole Scope of his Book, by Rea&s;on that he has never undertook to prove, thro' his Book, that I, or any of my covenant Brethren, in all this Reformation, are guil|ty of one Fact or Error, that he has repeat|edly charged us with; unle&s;s it be in Page 88, where the Author, in a weak and child|i&s;h Manner, pre&s;umes to write as followeth:
<Q>To prove that I have laid no unju&s;t Charge again&s;t you who have &s;eparated from the &s;tanding Churches or New-England, in what I have now alledged, I might bring many Te&s;timonies from &s;undry worthy Per&s;ons: But I &s;hall con|tent my&s;elf at pre&s;ent with the united Te&s;timony of Mr. Pre&s;ident Edwards, and Mr. Bellamy, in a Book written by the Latter, and recommended by the Former,</Q>
&amp;c. and &s;o cites a Pa&s;&s;age out of Mr. Bellamy to prove his Charge.&mdash; Had he a cited a Pa&s;&s;age out of Mr. Fla|vel's Works, wrote again&s;t the Errors of them Times a hundred Years before we had any Being, he would have proved his A&s;&s;er|tions as well as he has now done. For where has Mr. Edwards, or Mr. Bellamy, &s;hewn from our Writings, or any other Ways, that we hold the&s;e Things, charged again&s;t
<PB N="33" REF="010621_0032_0F81BA7ED11F8798">
us? Mr. Edwards is doubtle&s;s gone to Heaven; and I would charitably hope that Mr. Bellamy may get there too, &s;o as by Fire, 1 Cor. 3.15. But I belive that he will love the Separates better than he has done for many Years back, if he ever does, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, in Page 126, the Author has cited another Pa&s;&s;age out of Mr. Bellamy's Dia|logues, and &s;aith, Mr. B. has had a pretty large Acquaintance with the Separates, &amp;c. But I think not &s;o large as to &s;peak the Truth of them; for in the Pa&s;&s;age, now cited, he &s;aith,
<Q>I behold, 1&s;t. the Love, the &s;elf-moving Goodne&s;s of God, in the Gift of his Son; but not (as the Se|parates imagine) that he loves me in par|ticular, and is reconciled to me&mdash;</Q>
and &s;o on: Which A&s;&s;ertion is very fal&s;e and &s;landerous, according to what Knowledge I have got of my&s;elf &amp; Brethren; yet as fal&s;e as it is, it will &s;erve the Author's Turn, to prove all his A&s;&s;ertions again&s;t the Separates. But I de&s;ire Mr. Bellamy &amp; Mr. Bartlet, &s;ince they are Brethren together, in the &s;ame Cau&s;e and Profe&s;&s;ion, to compare their Witne&s;s a|gain&s;t the Separates together, &amp; &s;ee how they agree or rather di&s;agree. The One condemns the Separates for holding to a Faith that &s;tands connected with &s;elfi&s;h Views, &s;uppo&s;|ing that the Per&s;on imagines that there is &s;ome Favor be&s;towed upon him, that moves
<PB N="34" REF="010621_0033_0F81BA7F8BFF8C68">
the Per&s;on to believe, and love, &amp;c.&mdash; The Other condemns the Separates (or ra|ther my&s;elf) for holding a Faith that &s;ixes intirely in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and receives him alone, for what he is in his own eternal Ex|cellencies, exclu&s;ive of any previous Know|ledge of any &s;pecial Favor be&s;towed upon the Per&s;on, &amp;c. I clo&s;e this Remark with leaving the&s;e two Per&s;ons to di&s;pute this Difference out that is between&punc; them, and get agreed; otherwi&s;e their Witne&s;s again&s;t the Separates will not be legal.</P>
<P N="4">4. I had it upon my Mind to have made many Remarks upon Mr. Ro&s;s's Book, but find, if I go where my Mind leads, I mu&s;t write a large Volumn, in&s;tead of a &s;hort A|pology.

<P N="1">1&s;t then. I think I have a ju&s;t Right to exclude out of the Controver&s;y that is be|tween me and my Author, the Quakers, Moravians, Separate-Bapti&s;ts, Rogereens, and other Enthu&s;ia&s;ts; and leave them to vindicate them&s;elves, as they &s;ee fit.</P>

Do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are without, God judgeth." So that I, nor a|ny of my Brethren in the Mini&s;try, are no more to account for the&s;e out of Covenant, than the &s;tanding Mini&s;ters are for every corrupt, profane, immoral Per&s;on, that waits upon their Mini&s;try. Now, having excluded the&s;e out of the pre&s;ent Contro|ver&s;y, the Matter in Debate is brought into a &s;mall Compa&s;s. And who has a Right to look upon me, or my Brethren, guilty of the Things charged, without Evidence to prove the Facts charged? I &s;uppo&s;e that I have a ju&s;t Right to look upon the Au|thor's whole Performance, as it re&s;pects me and my covenant Brethren, a &s;inful, and &s;o a &s;hameful Way of &s;landering his Neighbours, Indeed it appears to me, that in the Method that he has proceeded in, again&s;t the Separates, that if Paul was here in this Reformation, he could not e&s;cape his Slanders.

<Q>If you were really hum|bled, how come you to be &s;o wi&s;e in your own Conceit, and to have &s;uch a high Opinion of your own Gifts, Experience and Grace; and &s;o much Contempt for all but your&s;elves?

Did you not make this one grand Plea, for your Separation from us, that our Church|es were not pure enough for &s;uch holy Per&s;ons as you? Were you not afraid &s;uch eminent Saints as you, would be polluted by having Communion with &s;uch Sinners as you think we are?

And indeed I &s;ee not why &s;uch a Declaration does not lie a|gain&s;t all Per&s;ons, in all Ages of the Church that have true Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and take his written Word as the only and alone Rule of Faith and Practice. For altho' Elder Pain, and my&s;elf, in our Books pub|li&s;hed, have laboured to prove, and, I think made it evident, that the religious Con&s;ti|tution of this Colony is not founded upon the Scriptures of Truth, but upon Men's Inventions. Yet the Author, nor any Bo|dy el&s;e, that I know of, has undertook in any &s;ober, &s;erious Manner, to &s;how where we have mi&s;&s;ed the Mind of God, and &s;o preverted the Scriptures that we have bro't to vindicate our Principles and Practice.&mdash; And till &s;omething of this Nature appears, it will be a fruitle&s;s Chace to follow every party, proud, &s;uper&s;titious Per&s;on, as the Author appears to be by his Book; which Performance is &s;uited to plea&s;e the Ene|mies of the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and to blind the Eyes of the ignorant, and lead them to believe a Lie. But I mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s the Au|thor, and his Book, de&s;iring and praying, that he may &s;ee his un&s;criptural and unchri&s;|tian Performance, and have his Heart truly humbled, and his Soul &s;aved.</P>

<P N="2">2.

<P N="4">4. It is an allowed Point, that every One has a Right to vindicate his own Character; which Principle brings me under a Nece&s;&s;ity to examine the religious Con&s;titution of this Colony, and carefully compare it with the Word of God, before I comply with it; otherwi&s;e I mu&s;t be accounted no better than a Papi&s;t, Mahometan or Pagan.&mdash; Therefore, to e&s;cape this reproachful Cha|racter, I may lawfully be ju&s;tified for going through the following Performance in my Remarks upon the religious Con&s;titution of this Colony.

<HEAD>Some Remarks, upon the Religious Con&s;titution, of the Colony of Connecti|cut, e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_BY the Religious Con&s;tituti|on, I mean certain Laws in the Colony Law Book, called eccle&s;ia&s;tical; with the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, agreed upon, by the El|ders and Me&s;&s;engers of the Churches, met at Say-Brook, e&s;pecially the Articles of Admini&s;tration of Church Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>In order to pro&s;ecute the following Per|formance, I &s;hall endeavour to build upon the Rock Je&s;us Chri&s;t (as he reveals him|&s;elf in the written Word) as laid in ZION, a chief Corner Stone, elect, precious, 1 Pet. 2.6. I&s;a. 28.16. "For other Foundation can no Man lay than that is laid, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 1 Cor. 3 11. Pray ob&s;erve. Not the Pre&s;criptions of Man, or Men, Co|lonies nor Kingdoms; but &s;trictly, and ab|&s;olutely

what is in the Scriptures of eternal Truth, before Kingdoms or Colonies was con&s;tituted or &s;et up.&mdash;Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the alone and only Head of his Church, Eph. 1.20, 21, 22. Col. 1.18. And the only Judge and Law-Giver, I&s;a. 33.22. It is to him, all Mortals that are happy, of any and every Profe&s;&s;ion, Rank and Order mu&s;t have Recour&s;e, by a &s;upernatural Agency of the Holy Spirit; who&s;e Office it is to regenerate the Heart, and implant that Faith which operates in divine Love and Union to Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Head; which Faith has a renewing and tran&s;porting Pow|er upon the whole Man. 2 Cor. 3.18. and engages the enlightened and &s;anctified Mind to be &s;trictly conformed to God, in all his religious, civil or moral Actions. Phil. 3.8 to 15. Tit. 2.14. As Man by nature, is naturally inclined to tran&s;gre&s;s God's righ|teous and ju&s;t Commands, and &s;o under ju&s;t Condemnation. John 3. 18&mdash;36. So al&s;o tho&s;e that are converted, and truly u|nited to Je&s;us, have a new Nature through which they freely and delightfully do God's Will; it is their Liberty, Privilege and Happine&s;s to keep God's Commands. Eph. 2.10. 1 John 5.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. and whil&s;t the Believer &s;o abides, there is no Condemnation to him. Rom. 8.1. Yea, that Per&s;on that, in pure

&s;anctifying Light, &s;ees Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be all, and in all, Col. 3.11. cannot, nor will not comply with any Articles of Faith or Practice, compiled and e&s;tabli&s;hed by Men, that he cannot &s;ee agreable to the Law and to the Te&s;timony, I&s;a. 8.20. or the writ|ten Word of God; altho' there may be Men united therewith that he e&s;teems as Men of Wi&s;dom, Gifts and Grace. Yea, if the&s;e Articles of Faith &s;hould be e&s;tab|li&s;hed by the Laws of a Colony or King|dom; the&s;e are all too &s;andy a Foundation for an upright Soul to act upon, neither will he comply with &s;uch a Con&s;titution, altho' he be threatned with Pri&s;on, Fag|gots and Fire: For the Language of his Heart is, "The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King, He will &s;ave us." I&s;a. 33.22. Again, that Per&s;on that by Faith &s;ees Chri&s;t to be All in All, &s;ees that his Con&s;cience is not his own to give, to plea&s;e this Man or that; but that Je&s;us Chri&s;t challenges the &s;ole Right of Con&s;cience, yea, the whole hu|man Soul, with all its Powers and Facul|ties, to be intirely at his Di&s;po&s;e. There|fore, this Per&s;on rejects all Challenges of Men, whether in the civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority. Rom. 14.4. Indeed, it is a granted and allowed Principle, by all true <PB N="46" REF="010621_0045_0F81BA8B8A808D88">
Prote&s;tants and Chri&s;tians, viz. the Right of private Judgment, or Liberty of Con|&s;cience, in Matters of Religion. And right Rea&s;on &s;hews that it ought to be &s;o; for no Man, whether Saint, Prie&s;t, or civil Ruler, can &s;tand between the great and ter|rible God, at the Judgment Day, to plead off his Neighbour from the Execution of &s;trict Ju&s;tice. Therefore, it is the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable Thing po&s;&s;ible, for any Man, or Powers Civil or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, to inter|rupt or deprive their Neighbour of the free Exerci&s;e of their Con&s;cience, in Matters of their Soul's Concerns. Thus far I would hope that I have wrote what the Reader's Con|&s;cience witne&s;&s;es to, that Liberty of Con|&s;cience, is a Per&s;on's unalterable Right, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I now proceed to take into &s;erious and clo&s;e Con&s;ideration the religious Con&s;titu|tion confe&s;&s;ed by the Body of the People in this Colony; and will endeavour to &s;hew wherein it appears to me, as I under&s;tand the Word of God, that it is not founded upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as he &s;hews his Mind in the written Word.&mdash;And &s;hall begin with what I find relative thereto in the Co|lony Law Book.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t then, See Colony Law-Book, Page 165.
<Q>Be it enacted, by the Governor, Council, &amp;c. That the Inhabitants of

any Town, or Society, or Pari&s;h, con&s;ti|tuted by this A&s;&s;embly, who are, or &s;hall be pre&s;ent at a Town or Society Meeting, legally warned; &s;hall have Power, by the major Vote of tho&s;e &s;o met, to call and &s;ettle a Mini&s;ter or Mi|ni&s;ters among them, and to provide for his or their Support and Maintenance, provided that no Per&s;ons be allowed to vote in any &s;uch Affairs, unle&s;s &s;uch Per&s;on or Per&s;ons have a Free-hold in the &s;ame Town or Society, raced at fifty Shillings, or forty Pounds E&s;tate in the common Li&s;t; or are Per&s;ons of full Age, and in full Communion with Church, in ;the &s;aid Town or Society.</Q></P>
<P N="1">1. This Con&s;titution Plan, gives the General A&s;&s;embly (which is, and always &s;hould &s;o remain, a civil Body, to tran&s;act in civil and moral Things) Power to con|&s;titute or make a &s;piritual or eccle&s;ia&s;tical Body. This, I think, is again&s;t, and con|trary to the Law of Nature, for any Spe|cies of Beings, rational or not, to produce, bring forth, and make that which is con|trary to its own Being or Nature. Indeed, civil Bodies may make, &amp; con&s;titute civil Bodies, but not religious or &s;piritual Bodies, for that mu&s;t be above their Nature or Power.&mdash; But to come to &s;omething more weighty.
<PB N="48" REF="010621_0047_0F81BA8FAC34BDF0">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t claims the &s;ole Right of making and con&s;tituting Churches, or eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Bodies. See P&s;al. 127.1. "Except the Lord build the Hou&s;e, they labour in vain that build it." P&s;alm 102.16. "When the Lord &s;hall build up Zion."&mdash;Mind, Reader, the Scriptures does not &s;ay, When General A&s;&s;emblies, nor Kings, nor Par|liaments, makes religious Societies or Churches: No, no; for they cannot con|vert one Soul, nor make no man religious: They may make Multitudes of abominable Hypocrites, which the Lord abhors; but not one meet Per&s;on for the Church of Chri&s;t. The Members of Chri&s;t's Church are made by the Power of his Word and Spirit, through the Means and In&s;truments he &s;ees &s;it, in his high Sovereignty, to u&s;e and work, by. I&s;a. 66.1, 2. Zech. 4.6, 7, 9. 1 Pet. 2.4 to 10. When Chri&s;t, by his Word and Spirit, has converted Sinners, and in&s;tructed their Minds by the Scriptures, in the Affairs of his vi&s;ible and &s;piritual Kingdom,; they being under&s;tandingly agreed in the Unity of the Holy Spirit, co|venanting to walk together in all the Laws and Ordinances of Chri&s;t's Hou&s;e &mdash; this is a Church of Chri&s;t, a &s;piritual Hou&s;e, &amp;c. Amos 3.3. Rom. 10.10. 1 John 1.3. 1 Pet. 2.5. I earne&s;tly reque&s;t of the Read|er
<PB N="49" REF="010621_0048_0F81BA90666CC2F0">
to turn to the Texts I cite in this Book, and labor to con&s;ider them well, that you may better under&s;tand what is right and what is wrong, in this Enquiry after the Truth.</P>
<P>Having briefly &s;hewn that it belongs to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to him alone, to make and con&s;titute religious Societies or Church|es; I think it is plain, that this religious Con&s;titution that I am labouring to unco|ver, u&s;urpes the Power above Chri&s;t, or, as Paul &s;aith, 2 The&s;. 2.4. "Who oppo&s;eth and exalteth him&s;elf above all that is call|ed God." I feel concerned how my Read|er will endure the plain, naked Truth. I would not for the World, write any Thing de&s;igning to &s;tir Corruption and Party in the Reader. Neither dare I for a World, keep back what I think the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t calls for; lea&s;t I &s;hould offend my Reader. Matth. 28.20. Luke 12.2 to 6. I de&s;ire the Reader to keep in Mind the Caution I have given, viz. to con&s;ider this Con&s;titu|tion, as much as po&s;&s;ible, as tho' it was &s;ent here from &s;ome remote Part, to read, and compare by the Word of God, &amp;c. To return to the Words of the Plan, which are,
<Q>That the Inhabitants of any Town or Society, or Pari&s;h, con&s;tituted by this A&s;&s;embly,</Q>
&amp;c.&mdash;Which &s;uppo&s;es no
<PB N="50" REF="010621_0049_0F81BA90DF1974D0">
Per&s;ons have a Right to form them&s;elves into a religious Society, without their Leave. No, if King George the Third, our right|ful Sovereign (in the civil Kingdom) &s;hould, upon any Occa&s;ion, come into the Bounds of Connecticut, he has no Liberty to wor|&s;hip God, according to his Con&s;cience, un|le&s;s this con&s;titution Head &s;ees fit, in their great Clemency, to indulge his Maje&s;ty with Liberty, &amp;c. For the Truth of this A&s;&s;ertion, I appeal to the C. L. B. Page 169. where the Church of England Profe&s;&s;ors came courte&s;ing and bowing to, and con|federating with, this Con&s;titution; to the di&s;covering their great Weakne&s;s and Fol|ly, when the Word of God, and the reli|gious Con&s;titution of the Nation, is on their Side.</P>
<P>To proceed. I have another Figure to u&s;e, in Order to di&s;cover this Con&s;titution, which is more &s;triking &amp; &s;hocking; which is to &s;ay, That if Je&s;us Chri&s;t was to come Per&s;onally into Connecticut, with all his Di&s;ciples, he could not gather and &s;ettle a Church, unle&s;s he would crouch, and come down to this Con&s;titution Plan; or that, in its Clemency, would allow Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Di&s;ciples, Liberty of Con&s;cience. If my Reader will put on Patience, and read with Meekne&s;s, I tru&s;t you will find
<PB N="51" REF="010621_0050_0F81BA91B6708218">
this Figure made out, from the Con&s;tituti|on Plan, comparing one Part with another, to take the true Intent of it: For it is plain, I think, to any Per&s;on that does not &s;hut his Eyes again&s;t the Light; that this Plan challenges the &s;ole Right of making Reli|gious Societies, and the Government of Con&s;cience. Yea, I think that it a&s;&s;umes the Prerogative that belongs to the Son of God alone. And how that will pairs in the Court of Heaven, judge ye. For &s;ee C. L. B. Page 139.
<Q>Nor &s;hall any Per&s;on neg|lect the public Wor&s;hip of God, in &s;ome lawful Congregation, and form them&s;elves into &s;eparate Companies, in pri|vate Hou&s;es, on Penalty of Ten Shillings for every &s;uch Offence, each Per&s;on &s;hall be guilty of.</Q>
Here, Reader, you may &s;ee a flat Contradiction, in tho&s;e that hold to this Plan, and yet pretend to hold Liber|ty of Con&s;cience; when, as the Ca&s;e may be, and has been, there is no Gap for one Breath of go&s;pel Liberty: For if we exer|ci&s;e our Gifts and Grace in the lawful A&s;|&s;emblies, we are had up, and carried to Pri&s;on, for making Di&s;turbance on the Sabbath. I my&s;elf have been confined in Hartford Pri&s;on near five Months, for no|thing but exhorting and warning the Peo|ple, after the public Wor&s;hip was done,
<PB N="52" REF="010621_0051_0F81BA926628E3F0">
and the A&s;&s;embly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. And whil&s;t I was there confined, three more Per&s;ons was &s;ent to Pri&s;on; one for exhorting, and two for wor&s;hipping God, in a private Hou&s;e, in a &s;eparate Meeting. And quick after I was relea&s;ed, by the Laws being an&s;wered by natural Relations unbeknown to me, then two Brethren more was committed for exhorting and preaching, and &s;everal others afterwards, for attending the &s;ame Duties; and I my&s;elf twice more was &s;ent to Pri&s;on, for the Mini&s;ter's Rates. I mu&s;t write a Volumn to acquaint my Reader with the Lord's marvelous Lovingkindne&s;s towards me in Pri&s;on, and the Mea&s;ures he took for my Deliverance. But the&s;e Facts may &s;hew the Reader, that unle&s;s we become all Spirit, and take Wing up in the Air, to attend &s;ocial Wor&s;hip where gro&s;s Con|&s;tables, Grand-jurors, Courts and Pri&s;ons cannot come, we cannot e&s;cape this Con|&s;titution Power. Furthermore, that my Charge again&s;t the Plan is true, con&s;ider the expre&s;s Word of the Law,
<Q>Nor &s;hall any Per&s;on neglect,</Q>
&amp;c. Note here, Je&s;us Chri&s;t is a Per&s;on, and the glorious Per&s;on of the God-Man; and upon Sup|po&s;ition he was here, with all his Di&s;ciples, the Plan has made no Provi&s;ion for them; they wouldly equally expo&s;ed to the Laws
<PB N="53" REF="010621_0052_0F81BA932CE42830">
as any poor Separate. And I think this cannot be denied by Per&s;ons of Hone&s;ty that will con&s;ider the Con&s;titution Plan.&mdash; For if Chri&s;t's holy and jealous Eye &s;hould &s;ee the lawful Wor&s;hip &s;o remote from his Father's Will, Rules, and Laws, that, con|&s;i&s;tent with his Honor and high Dignity, he could not wor&s;hip with them; then we have all Rea&s;on po&s;&s;ible to believe that he, and his Followers, would meet with the like Treatment, from the People of this Con&s;titution, as he did from his own pro|fe&s;&s;ing People, Jews, and Scribes, and Pha|ri&s;ees, in the Days when he was here upon Earth.</P>
<P>Again, That the Plan that I am labor|ing to hold up to the rational, unprejudi|ced Mind, denies the &s;acred Rights of Con|&s;cience, is further evident&mdash;C. L. B. P. 232.
<Q>That &s;uch Inhabitants of Towns and Societies as have obtained, or hereafter &s;hall obtain Liberty of the General A&s;|&s;embly, to procure, and have the preach|ing of the Go&s;pel among them&s;elves, for certain Months in the Year, di&s;tinct and &s;eparate from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Place of wor&s;hip in &s;uch Town or Society to which they belong,</Q>
&amp;c. The Reader may &s;ee that this Part of the Plan perfectly agrees with the Pa&s;&s;age la&s;t cited, and challenges
<PB N="54" REF="010621_0053_0F81BA93D00AE730">
the Government of Con&s;cience out of Chri&s;t's Hand. For con&s;ider what Chri&s;t &s;aith, and what this Plan virtually &s;aith.</P>
<P N="1">1. Chri&s;t &s;aith, as in John 4.21 to 24.
<Q>But the Hour cometh, and now is, when the true Wor&s;hippers &s;hall wor&s;hip the Father in Spirit and in Truth, for the Father &s;eeketh &s;uch to wor&s;hip him. God is a Spirit, and they that wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in Spirit &amp; in Truth.</Q>
Thus &s;aith the Son of God; but the Plan virtually &s;aith,
<Q>Not &s;o, Lord&mdash;we do not like your Opinion&mdash;it tends to &s;trike up all our good regular Churches, that we, in our Wi&s;dom, have made and e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law: For you give Liberty of Con|&s;cience, and allow every One to judge for him&s;elf, which Wor&s;hip is &s;piritual, and which is not&mdash;and that opens a Door for Separation from our Churches that we have made, and &s;o crumble us to Pieces. Al&s;o, to de&s;pi&s;e the good Mini&s;ters that we have made for the People, and opens a Gap for tho&s;e that think they are con|verted, and gifted, and called of God to improve their Gifts, to &s;et them&s;elves up as public Teachers: And &s;uch an Allowance tends to make Divi&s;ions and Sub-divi&s;ions&mdash;and there will be no End, if this Liberty of Con&s;cience is granted.
<PB N="55" REF="010621_0054_0F81BA9502300B18">
Therefore, Lord, it &s;hall not be &s;o&mdash; we do not like your &s;piritual Scheme of Wor&s;hip&mdash;it tends to wild Di&s;order and Enthu&s;ia&s;m.

<P N="2">2. The Scriptures &s;aith, Zech. 4.6&mdash;9.
<Q>Not by Might, nor by Power, but by my Spirit, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts</Q>

<Q>Not &s;o, Lord&mdash;for our Churches will crumble to Pieces, if they are not upheld by the
<PB N="56" REF="010621_0055_0F81BA9566392FD0">
civil Power: The civil Power made them, and they mu&s;t uphold them.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. The Scriptures &s;hew, that it is the Love of God, true Love to him in the Heart, that lays the Foundation, and en|gages a Per&s;on to keep God's Commands. 1 John 5.2.3. 2 Cor. 5.14. But this Plan &s;aith,
<Q>No, not &s;o&mdash;there would be no Regard paid to God's Commands, if it was not for our religious Con&s;titution.</Q>
Again, God forbids that Men &s;hould be forced to fear him by the Precepts of Men, I&s;a. 29.33. But this Plan &s;aith,
<Q>That there would be no Fear of God in the Land, if it was not for our religious Laws, and the wi&s;e Plan that our civil Rulers have e&s;tabli&s;hed.</Q>
Mind, Reader, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the Power of his Word and Spirit, is all out of the Que&s;tion, with this religious Plan.</P>
<P N="4">4. Once more, in this Divi&s;ion. Je&s;us Chri&s;t challenges the &s;ole Right of Con&s;cience&mdash; that a Man's Judgment, and his whole All be wholly &s;ubjected to him alone. Rom 14.4.
<Q>Who art thou that judged another Man's Servant? To his own Ma&s;ter he &s;tandeth or falleth.</Q>
Chap. 12.1, 2. 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. But this Plan &s;aith,
<Q>Not &s;o, Lord&mdash;if we have not the Govern|ment of Con&s;cience, our good Order, good Mini&s;ters and Churches will all be
<PB N="57" REF="010621_0056_0F81BA96152D1CB0">
da&s;hed to Pieces&mdash;the Indulgence we, in our Clemency, have already granted, has given us a dreadful Shock&mdash;and if we re|&s;ign up Con&s;cience to your Government, it will be all up with us, as to our Reli|gion and good Order.</Q>
Now, the Lan|guage that this Plan hath, in its own Na|ture, is &s;hocking; but it further &s;aith, in all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws,
<Q>That, let Chri&s;t and Con&s;cience &s;ay what they will, we will be obeyed, or the Penalties we have annexed to Di&s;obedience &s;hall be put into Execution,</Q>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus, Reader, I have endeavoured &s;e|riou&s;ly and uprightly to a&s;&s;ert and &s;hew my Lord and Ma&s;ter's ju&s;t Right, as being the only Lord of Con&s;cience: Al&s;o, wherein the Con&s;titution claims that Authority over Men's Con&s;ciences, which belongs only to the Son of God. Having traced this Plan, to find where its Bounds are, and the Spot fixed for public Wor&s;hip; I now come to take into Con&s;ideration, their Choice of their Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve here, the Per&s;ons qualified to vote, are tho&s;e that have a Freehold in the &s;ame Town or Society, rated at fifty Shil|lings, or forty Pounds in the common Li&s;t, or, &amp;c.&mdash;Here I would note, that we do well to con&s;ider, that the Choice of a
<PB N="58" REF="010621_0057_0F81BA96CB0A4B40">
Mini&s;ter is a Matter of as great Impor|tance as any Thing that re&s;pects the vi&s;ible Affairs of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, here below. If the Mini&s;ter be uncoverted, he is like|ly to lead the Flock down to Hell. See Matth. 15.14. An unconverted Mini&s;ter is an extreme heavy Judgment from God, upon a People; and a Man qualified ac|cording to the Scriptures, &s;ent by Chri&s;t to a People, is an exceeding great Ble&s;&s;ing: Therefore the Choice of a Mini&s;ter is of va&s;t Con&s;equence, one Way of the other. Yet &s;ee how this Con&s;titution treats it&mdash; Ob&s;erve, if any Per&s;on be in its Limits, having fifty Shillings Free-hold, or forty Pounds E&s;tate in, &amp;c. altho' he &s;hould be a Dei&s;t, Arian or Socinian; yea, if he be an Athei&s;t, and have a Mind to vote, to keep out a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, I know not who can hinder him by that Plan; but if he be a profane Swearer, a Drunkard, or a Thief, they are as good Voters, according to this Plan, as the mo&s;t holy, knowing, upright Man in the Church. Let us view this Part of the Plan carefully, and compare it with the Scriptures.</P>
<P N="1">1. Chri&s;t &s;aith, Matth. 7.18. <Q>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit; nei|ther can a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit.</Q>
Con&s;ider, if the Church &s;hould
<PB N="59" REF="010621_0058_0F81BA97FA200CF8">
con&s;i&s;t of twenty male Members, all con|verted, holy Men, and choo&s;e a Man qua|lified as well as Paul was, and the Society Members be more in Number, altho' they &s;hould be all &s;candalous as before mention|ed; yet if they have the Money Qualifica|tions can out vote in the Church, and prevent them of their ju&s;t Right and Choice.&mdash; What is this, but depriving the Spou&s;e of Chri&s;t of the &s;acred Rights of Con&s;cience? Surely this cannot be a good Tree, that bears &s;uch bad Fruit!</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Scripture clearly divides Saints from Sinners, in their Acting in re|ligious Affairs, or the Affairs of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, Ezek. 44, 7, 2 Cor 6.14, 15, 16. "Be ye not unequally yoked together with Unbelievers; for what Fellow&s;hip hath Righteou&s;ne&s;s with Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s?" and &s;o on. Again, &s;ee John 15.18, 19. "If ye were of the World, the World would love his own: but becau&s;e ye are not of World, but I have cho&s;en you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you." 1 Cor. 2.14, 15. "But the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God, for they are Fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him; neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned. But he that is &s;pi|ritual, judgeth all Things; yet he him&s;elf
<PB N="60" REF="010621_0059_0F81BA9850D572C0">
is judged of no Man." 1 John 4, 4, 5, 6. "Ye are of God, little Children, and have over-come them; becau&s;e greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the World. They are of the World, therefore &s;peak they of the World, and the World heareth them. We are of God; he that knoweth God heareth us." Chap. 5, 19. John 17. 9.14. But this religious Plan confronts the Word of God, and &s;aith, the wicked and Righteous may act together, in the mo&s;t Important Affairs of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, viz. in choo&s;ip"g a Mini&s;ter for the Church: And a Drunkard, or profane Swearer, or Thief, is as good a Voter as the mo&s;t godly Man in the Church.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. By this Plan of con&s;tituting and forming Churches, and &s;ettling Mini&s;ters, if the Society Members be more than the Church Members, and &s;hould be &s;o di&s;po|&s;ed (not liking the Mini&s;ter the Church has cho&s;e) conform them&s;elves into Church Or|der, with the Help and Approbation of neighbouring Mini&s;ters, and choo&s;e a Mi|ni&s;ter that &s;uits them&s;elves. Now this new formed Church, if it &s;hould &s;o happen that there was not one holy Man in it, and the fir&s;t Church all truly Godly, and in the go&s;pel Rule; yet the la&s;t formed, having the major Part of the Society, have Power to
<PB N="61" REF="010621_0060_0F81BA990BDD0878">
choo&s;e a Man contrary to the Minds of the fir&s;t Church, and vote away their E&s;tates to &s;upport him. And what is &s;till more &s;tri|king, is, that Money is the &s;ole Cau&s;e of &s;triping this fir&s;t formed Church, of all her &s;acred Rights and Privileges, that well might Paul &s;ay, Tim. 6.10 "For the Love of Money is the Root of all Evil:" For this Church falls below the Title of being lawful, and becomes unlawful, when they have not altered neither in Principle or Practice, &amp; are not only obliged to have their E&s;tates halled away, to &s;upport a Man and Wor&s;hip which they know to be contrary to God's Word&mdash;but which is more &s;hocking, to be compell'd to attend that Wor&s;hip them&s;elves, or &s;uffer the Penalty for their Non-attendance. Now if this is not to com|mit a Rape upon Chri&s;t's cha&s;te Spou&s;e which he has bought with his precious Blood, I know not what is. Surely the Lord Je&s;us will, e'er long, revenge &s;uch Injury done to his dear Bride, in dreadful Things in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and meet &s;uch his Enemies in Robes dre&s;t in Vengeance. Read I&s;a. 51. 22, 23. Chap. 63.1 to 7. Ver. Chap. 66.1 to 7. Zech. 8.2.</P>
<P>My Reader may object and &s;ay, I carry Things to Extremes; and &s;uppo&s;e Things that never was, nor like to be. An&s;wer, <PB N="62" REF="010621_0061_0F81BA9CB6568D90">
I will grant it is likely that every Member in a Church may not be holy at Heart; al&s;o, that there is no Church in the Con|&s;titution but what may have &s;ome Saints in it. Let this be accepted, then there is no Thanks due to this religious Plan. That what I have now &s;et forth, does not happen daily, the Con&s;titution admits of it, and, in Fact, has brought forth my Ob&s;ervation, in the very Nature that I have &s;et it forth, only &s;ome Difference in the Circum&s;tance. Witne&s;s the Affair at Canterbury:&mdash;To give the Reader a full Narrative of that Affair would make a Volumn; but a &s;hort Hint I think is nece&s;&s;ary, to give Evidence to what I have noted. Therefore, according to the be&s;t of my Memory, as I have been informed, Canterbury Church was fir&s;t ga|thered and founded upon the &s;trict congre|gational Principles of our godly Forefa|thers; and being de&s;titute of a Mini&s;ter, they laboured to get one qualified accord|ing to the Scriptures: But the Society (with their money Qualification) being mo&s;t in Number, prevented. After much Debates and Labor between the Major Part of the Church and the Minor, with the Society, they differing about a Mini&s;ter; the minor Part of the Church withdrew from the Church, and formed them&s;elves
<PB N="63" REF="010621_0062_0F81BA9D8953C1A0">
into a new Body, under this Plan that I am uncovering: Then they with the major Part of the Society, made the major Part of the Whole, and &s;o cho&s;e a Man to &s;uit them&s;elves. The Church oppo&s;ed the Choice&mdash;Fir&s;t becau&s;e it was their Right to chu&s;e their own Mini&s;ter.&mdash;Secondly be|cau&s;e they looked upon the Man that the Society had cho&s;e, not qualified according to the Scriptures, as their Objections &s;hew, and dare not, for their Soul's Sake, &s;ubmit to the Choice, but &s;trongly oppo&s;ed the Man's &s;ettling (they being the major Part of the Church, it was their ju&s;t Right to have the Choice of their Mini&s;ter, and that according to the Scriptures, and the con|&s;tant Practice of our Forefathers 1 Cor. 14.15, 16.) When the Council a&s;&s;embled to|gether to ordain the Man that the Society had cho&s;e, the Work was &s;o heavy in the Circum&s;tance of Things, that it was three Days, I think, before it was accompli&s;hed. The Matter was &s;o glaring, to proceed to ordain a Man over the Church (that had always been the fir&s;t &s;tanding Church in the Town) right again&s;t the Church's Con&s;ent; that altho' the Con&s;titution cloathed them with Power to go forward, yet I &s;uppo&s;e that their Con&s;ciences would not &s;uffer them, till they had got the Society to vote their
<PB N="64" REF="010621_0063_0F81BA9D926B7FF8">
Con&s;ent, that the General A&s;&s;embly &s;hould &s;et the Church off to be an eccle&s;ia&s;tical So|ciety. And the Council al&s;o ordered their Moderator to prepare a Memorial to &s;end to the A&s;&s;embly for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. (In &s;o doing they put a Plai&s;ter upon their Con&s;cience, which was &s;ore, and &s;o healed it, for a Time, never examining into the Nature of the Di&s;ea&s;es.) So they went forward, and ordained the Man (that Mo|ney had cho&s;e.) I was Per&s;onally pre&s;ent when the Church gave in their la&s;t Te&s;ti|mony again&s;t the Council's Proceeding to Ordination; and &s;o the Church withdrew out of the Meeting-Hou&s;e, as the Council went forward to ordain, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here Reader, let me inform you, what I firmly believe in the Affair. That from the Acquaintance I got of this Church, that withdrew, they was the fir&s;t Church of Chri&s;t, that ever my Eyes beheld, bearing the Fruits and Characters that the Scriptures give of a Church of Chri&s;t. See John 17, 6. "I have manife&s;ted thy Name unto the Men which thou gave&s;t me out of the World. Ver. 14, "I have given them thy Word, and the World hath hated them be|cau&s;e they are not of the World, even as I am not of the World, &amp;c. It appeared plain to me as Chri&s;t &s;aith, that becau&s;e he had given this People an experimental
<PB N="67" REF="010621_0064_0F81BA9E4C8A2CB0">
Acquaintance with his Word, which they con&s;cientiou&s;ly endeavoured to practice ac|cording thereto; therefore the Society or World hated them. But I te&s;tify that Je|&s;us Chri&s;t was graciou&s;ly pre&s;ent with them, in their withdraw, with the enlightning, quickening, leading, teaching Influences of his Holy Spirit. The Word of God fell with divine Power upon the little de&s;|pi&s;ed Flock of Chri&s;t: That I could truly and under&s;tandingly &s;ay, it was good for me to be there, &amp;c. But to return, to Matter of Fact, which was, that this Church now fell below the Title of being lawful; al&s;o under Tribute to the Society; and more dreadful &s;till, according to the Plan, obliged to attend Public Wor&s;hip on the Lord's-Day, and hear the Man that Money had introduced into the Pulpit, again&s;t the Church's &s;olemn Warnings and Rejections. Here Reader you may &s;ee my former Ob|&s;ervations was ju&s;t; for this Church was always owned to be a Church of Chri&s;t, and lawful ever &s;ince Canterbury had a Church, till now. But now &s;he is &s;trip'd of all &s;a|cred Rites, and mo&s;t valuable Privileges. And how?&mdash;Why by this religious Plan, operating according to its own Nature.&mdash; But what is her Crime?&mdash;Why &s;he has at this Time proved cha&s;te to Chri&s;t, her only
<PB N="68" REF="010621_0065_0F81BA9F1BE9E3A8">
Head and Hu&s;band; in that &s;he would not leave his Word, Rules &amp; Laws, for Men's Inventions and Traditions. But my Reader may further object, and &s;ay, I carry Things too far, and endeavour to make Things wor&s;e than they are; for the Society has voted their Con&s;ent to have them &s;et off, and the Reverend Council al&s;o. An&s;wer, What if this &s;upreme Head of this Plan, does not &s;ee fit to alter what they in their Wi&s;dom have planed, as a &s;tanding Rule of Practice for Societies to proceed in, in order to &s;ettle Mini&s;ters, nor to give Relief any Way that an&s;wers the tender, grieved, upright Con&s;cience? I a&s;k in Meek|ne&s;s, who &s;hall an&s;wer at the Bar of God, for all the abominable Oppre&s;&s;ion and Per&s;ecution done to this Church, for fifteen Years together, notwith&s;tanding all their voting; not only pu&s;hing them out of the Meeting-Hou&s;e, that was built for them, in that Principle and Profe&s;&s;ion to wor&s;hip God in, and robbing them of their Pro|perty in it, but, additional thereto, &s;train|ing away their Sub&s;tance, Hor&s;es and Oxen, &s;tripping them out of their Teams, in the mid&s;t of Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;eizing Cows, Sheep, and poor People's Meat out of their Tubs, and other Uten&s;ils, exceedingly wanted in their Families? And what is &s;till beyond,
<PB N="69" REF="010621_0066_0F81BA9FDEA16288">
&s;eizing and impri&s;oning the Bodies of this Flock of Chri&s;t, whil&s;t their poor Fami|lies are left to &s;hift as they can! Neither have they done any Wrong to their Neigh|bours of this Con&s;titution; no, not touch|ed a Hair of their Heads; but only lived in the Principles and Practices that they was educated and brought up in, with the additional Ble&s;&s;ing of the Out-pourings of God's Holy Spirit upon them. Some of my Readers will likely &s;ay, that the Society is not to blame for this Oppre&s;&s;ion, nor the Reverend and good Council, nor the Con|&s;titution. Therefore I a&s;k my dear Reader again, with my Heart full of Pain and Di&s;|tre&s;s, for poor Connecticut, who mu&s;t an|&s;wer for all the dreadful Oppre&s;&s;ion and Per|&s;ecution committed (not only in Canterbu|ry, but many other Towns in the Colony) under the Light of the Go&s;pel, when the Judge of Quick and Dead, &s;hall be &s;eated upon his great white Throne of impartial Ju&s;tice, and Criminals, be they who they will, &s;hall have no Excu&s;e to make for their cruel Oppre&s;&s;ion and Per&s;ecution? No, not that crowned Kings have enacted, &amp;c. nor yet that any haughty Monarchs of the Earth, with their decreed religious E&s;tab|li&s;hments, nor the E&s;tabli&s;hments of Co|lonies, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical Councils nor Socie|ties

No, all &s;uch Excu&s;es &s;hall be &s;wept away, as Refuges of Lies: And God, the great and terrible God, and poor Oppre&s;&s;ors and Per&s;ecutors, have a Meeting to have Things &s;ettled in &s;trict Ju&s;tice for one whole Eternity, when the &s;trong Arm of Ven|geance &s;hall be made quite naked and bare, to execute divine Wrath upon the mi&s;erable Creatures. But I return to the Narrative. This Church of Chri&s;t, &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed, in &s;uita|ble Time after the Ordination afore-mention|ed, &s;ent a Prayer to the Hon. General A&s;&s;em|bly, a&s;king nothing but what was their ju&s;t Right, owning the A&s;&s;embly as God's Mi|ni&s;ters in the civil Kingdom; and Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be King in Zion, and the only Lord of Con&s;cience. They al&s;o carried the Church's Records, &s;hewing that they was the Church fir&s;t formed in Canterbury.&mdash; Al&s;o, the Society's Vote, and the Reverend Council's Prayer, but was denied their Re|que&s;t, and obliged to bear the continued Oppre&s;&s;ion (notwith&s;tanding all the Doings of the Society or Council) they bowed down, and let the Wicked go over them for many Years. I&s;a. 51.22, 23. in which Time they &s;ent &s;everal more Prayers, without any Relief. And all this While they re|mained
<PB N="71" REF="010621_0068_0F81BAA14C923748">
in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure cha&s;te to their deare&s;t Lord and Ma&s;ter; yet, not|with&s;tanding, not continuing to watch and pray always: But a few Years back, thro' &s;ome Means or other (and I think it is high Time for them to know what, and repent in Du&s;t and A&s;hes) have proved uncha&s;te to Chri&s;t, and have played the Harlor, in &s;ub|mitting to this un&s;criptural Plan, that claims that Government over them, which is due to none but Chri&s;t alone. The Truth of this Charge may be &s;een in the Society-Vote, which the Separates (as they are now called) voted promi&s;cuou&s;ly with the Soci|ety; which Vote may be &s;een in the Socie|ty and Colony Records; a Copy of which is in my Keeping, but too long to tran&s;|cribe. Had not this Ca&s;e been publick, I &s;hould not for my Right Hand, tell it in Gath, nor publi&s;h it in the Streets of A&s;ke|lon. But they them&s;elves have given Oc|ca&s;ion, 2 Sam. 1.19 20. "Let it be for a Lamentation, till their Captivity is return|ed, &amp;c." So I will return to the Wall, where I have, thro' Grace, dug, and found a Hole, and enter in at the Door, and take another Turn in this Chamber of Imagery. Ezek. 8.6 to the End.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, Reader, in the Page 165, where I fir&s;t began my Search in this Plan, &s;hew|ing
<PB N="72" REF="010621_0069_0F81BAA20FF75760">
the Qualifications that Voters mu&s;t be found in, that chu&s;e a Mini&s;ter, they act|ing in their Direction, &s;aith,
<Q>That the Mini&s;ter or Mini&s;ters, which have been or &s;hall be &s;o called and &s;ettled, &s;hall be the Mini&s;ter or Mini&s;ters of &s;uch Town or Society, &amp; all Agreements which have been or &s;hall be made by the Major Part of the Inhabitants of &s;uch Town or Society qualified &amp; meet as afore&s;aid, with &s;uch Mini&s;ter or Mini&s;ters, re&s;pecting his or their Settlement and Maintenance, &s;hall be binding and obligatory on all the In|habitants,</Q>
&amp;c. Now, Reader, I con|clude, that you will readily grant, that that Plan which is formed for a Rule of Action, and flatly contradicts it&s;elf, &s;o as no Judg|ment can be formed from the Plan, to fix the Action, cannot be founded upon the Word of God, but mu&s;t have its Origi|ginal from &s;ome other Quarter. Thus I under&s;tand, is the Ca&s;e of this Plan. For here you &s;ee, in the Pa&s;&s;age now cited, the Mini&s;ter &s;o cho&s;e and contracted with, &s;hall be the Mini&s;ter. Pray mind, the Matter is po&s;itively fixed&mdash;&s;hall, &amp;c. Now turn to another Part of this Plan, and &s;ee how flat the Contradiction is. C. L. B. P. 169. Here you may &s;ee the Hon.

with good Liking, and great Appro|bation, the Agreement of the Rev. Mi|ni&s;ters and Me&s;&s;engers met at Say-brook; and to put their Sanction upon what they had agreed to, decreeing that all &s;uch that united therewith &s;hould be accounted law|ful, or e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law. Now their being Enlargment made to the former Plan, we do well to &s;ee what it is. S. Brook Conf. P. 112.
<Q>That, according to the common Prac|tice of our Churches,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;ad Mi&s;take&mdash;for no &s;uch Practice had ever been in the Churches, till this Plan introdu|ced it.</NOTE> nothing &s;hall be deemed an Act, or Judgment of any Council, which hath not the Major Part of the Elders pre&s;ent concurring, and &s;uch a Number of the Me&s;&s;engers pre|&s;ent as makes the Majority of the Coun|cil,</Q>
&amp;c. Now, let us put the&s;e two Parts of the Plan together, and hear what it &s;peaks, as the Ca&s;e may frequently hap|pen, walking in this Rule, i. e. the Man cho&s;en by the major Part of the Society, &s;o and &s;o qualified, &s;hall be the Man; al&s;o the Man cho&s;en by the major Part &s;hall not be the Man. And why?&mdash;Becau&s;e the Vote of the major Part of the Elders pre|&s;ent is wanting; and &s;o no Judgment can
<PB N="74" REF="010621_0071_0F81BAA3FB072908">
po&s;&s;ibly come forth upon this Plan, in this Ca&s;e. Plea&s;e to look of it well; and do not be offended, becau&s;e I take Pains to hold it up before your Eyes, ju&s;t as it is in its own Nature.&mdash;For &s;o it &s;peaks&mdash;This Man &s;hall be the Mini&s;ter for the Society, and the &s;ame Man &s;hall not, &amp;c. Now what &s;hall the Mini&s;ter, legally or lawful|ly cho&s;en by the Society, do in this Dilem|ma? Why, if he has got a right good Bar|gain by the Contract, and he chu&s;es to hold the Society to the Agreement; he mu&s;t certainly have his Price agreed upon (un|le&s;s the Society proves Knaves) and for this Rea&s;on, the Bargain was completed, both Parties agreed before either of the Parties knew how the Matter would turn, in the Man's being &s;eparated to Office-Work. The Society mu&s;t know, that the Man cannot inve&s;t him&s;elf into Office, and he &s;tanding ready to have it done for him, not wanting, on his Side the Que&s;tion.&mdash; Therefore I think that the Society mu&s;t make the be&s;t that they can of their Bargain; for this Plan hath bro't forth its own Na|ture to them, gave them a Mini&s;ter, and yet no Mini&s;ter. And &s;ince they chu&s;e &s;uch a Rule to walk by, they have no Body to blame, but them&s;elves. Yet I am jealous that there is Hundreds in Connecticut that
<PB N="75" REF="010621_0072_0F81BAA4A6890168">
would be highly offended at their Neigh|bour for &s;peaking again&s;t this Plan; when at the &s;ame Time, the poor, &s;uper&s;titious Per&s;ons know but little more of their own Plan than the Child unborn. A &s;tupid, ig|norant, carele&s;s Mind about Soul Concerns, and the Affairs of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, I te&s;|tify, is a very heavy and &s;ore Judgment of God upon this Land; for Wars, then the Oppre&s;&s;ion of a Stamp-Act, &amp;c. Now, as to the Proof of this la&s;t Ob&s;ervation upon the Plan's contradicting it&s;elf; I need no more but remind my Reader of Walling|ford Affair; the Rupture and Confu&s;ion this Plan brought forth there in &s;ettling a Mini&s;ter. For the Truth is, the fir&s;t Soci|ty there got a Mini&s;ter according to the Con&s;titution, and the &s;ame Time contrary to the Con&s;titution; which is to &s;ay, they got him, or cho&s;e him according to the Plan, in C.L.B. Page 165, by the major Vote of the Society, and contrary to P. 169, which e&s;tabli&s;hes Say-brook Plan; and that requires the major Part of the El|ders pre&s;ent to concur, which the Society had not; but the minor Part withdrew from the Council and ordained the Man, &amp;c. In|deed this Affair at Wallingford, has been a preaching Providence to me, and has been in&s;trumental with other Things to introduce me into the Labor of Writing this Book,
<PB N="76" REF="010621_0073_0F81BAA50A9D5C88">
to &s;ee the Learned, contending one again&s;t another, as their printed Pamphlets make manife&s;t, and all for a Shadow. For who|ever is acquainted with their Debates may remember that the Con&s;titution has been the Bone of Contention&mdash;One Party &s;aith it means &s;o, and the Other Party &s;aith not &s;o, but &s;uch and &s;uch Con&s;tructions it will bear. But the Word of God is all out of the Que&s;tion, on both Sides; for neither Party has gone &s;o far Back, as to introduce that to &s;ettle the Controver&s;y, or produce what that &s;aith in the Matter. Con&s;titution! Con&s;titution! is the all and all with them: Which has brought a Nece&s;&s;ity upon me, (altho' mo&s;t uneaqual) to produce the Word of God, and compare the Con&s;titu|tion with it, to know wherein it differs from that &s;ure Standard of Faith &amp; Practice. But I return to con&s;ider the Method which this Plan has formed and fixed, in Order to &s;up|port that Wor&s;hip which is e&s;tabli&s;hed by it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then I &s;hall turn the Reader to con&s;i|der &amp; look upon a more antient Plan, formed &amp; decreed in the high &amp; &s;upreme Court of Heaven. See the old Law Book, which &s;hews how God's Wor&s;hip was, and is to be &s;up|ported. Deut. 18.1.2. "The Prie&s;ts, the Leavites and all the Tribes of Levi, &s;hall have no Part nor Inheritance with I&s;rael; they &s;hall eat the Offerings of the Lord,
<PB N="77" REF="010621_0074_0F81BAAA8830AE00">
made by Fire, &amp; his Inheritance: therefore &s;hall they have no Inheritance among their Brethren: the Lord is their Inheritance, a|mong their Brethren; the Lord is their In|heritance, as he hath &s;aid unto them." Pray mind the Direction given, "they &s;hall eat the Offerings of the Lord made by Fire;" and what they be, may be &s;een, in Num. 18. 9. "This &s;hall be thine of the Mo&s;t Holy Things re&s;erved from the Fire every Oblati|on of theirs;" and &s;o on thro' the Ch. Mind V. 20. "And the Lord &s;pake unto Aaron, thou &s;halt have no Inheritance in their Land; nei|ther &s;halt thou have any Part among them; I am thy Part and thine Inheritnce among the Children of I&s;rael," This, in &s;hort, from the Old Te&s;tament; all which &s;hews that their is no Allowance for the Prie&s;ts and the People, to come into any legal Contract or Bargain; becau&s;e the Lord has fixed the Way and Manner, of the Prie&s;ts' Support; which was the People's attending in a free Way &amp; Manner, to wait upon the Wor&s;hip of God, with the Offerings that he had appoint|ed; and no civil Power concerned to puni&s;h the Neglect. See Mal. 3.8.9. "Will a Man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me, but ye &s;ay, wherein have we robbed thee? in Tithes and Offerings. Ye are cur&s;ed, with a Cur&s;e, for ye have robbed me, even this whole Nation." Note here, God does not
<PB N="78" REF="010621_0075_0F81BAAC2DA1F608">
&s;ay, ye have robbed the Prie&s;ts, or one Ano|ther. "But ye have robbed me." Nor ye have broke your Words, or ye have not fulfiled your civil Contract: therefore fulfil it, pay up the Arrearage, or el&s;e the civil Rulers &s;hall take Care that it is ful|filed, &amp;c. No, no, not a Word of this in all the Scriptures. What then? why repent, and turn to God and his Ordinances, and now practice in your Duty.&mdash;Bring ye all the Tithes, &amp;c. and I will pour you out a Ble&s;&s;ing, &amp;c. It cannot be tho't that God would have taught his People to break le|gal or civil Contracts. Therefore, we may a&s;&s;uredly gather, that there never was not any between the Prie&s;ts and People, except|ing One; and that may be read at large in Judges 17 Chap. and this agrees with the Con&s;titution Plan, and in my humble Opinion, is the only Text in the Bible that comes to the Ca&s;e of a Mini&s;ter and People contracting together for the Mini&s;ter's year|ly Service, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2ndly. Let us turn our Eye a Minute to the new Law Book, decreed by the &s;ame Authority as the Old before-mentioned, and &s;ee what it &s;aith about the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and their Support. Matth. 10.8, 9. "Freely ye have received, freely give.&mdash; Provide neither Gold, nor Silver, nor Bra&s;s in your Pur&s;e." Luke 10. 7. "And in the
<PB N="79" REF="010621_0076_0F81BAAC938DF758">
&s;ame Hou&s;e remain eating and drinking &s;uch Things as they &s;hall give, for the La|bourer is worthy of his Hire." 1 Pet. 5.2. "Feed the Flock of God which is among you, taking the Over&s;ight thereof, not by Con&s;traint, but willingly, not for filthy Lucre, but of a ready Mind." 1 Cor. 9.13, 14. "Do you not know that they which mini&s;ter about holy Things, live of the Things of the Temple? and they which wait at the Altar, are Partakers with the Altar? Even &s;o hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Go&s;pel, &s;hould live of the Go&s;pel." Here take Notice, that the New-Te&s;tament perfectly agrees with the Old, and refers back to the Support of God's Wor&s;hip under the Law, and then ordains the like Plan under the Go&s;pel, differing Nothing in their Nature, only in their Circum&s;tance. Under the Law, God's Wor&s;hip was &s;upported from God's &s;pecial Command, by the People's Free-offerings: So is the Rule now fixed by the Decree of Heaven. Note&mdash;Even &s;o hath the Lord or|dained&mdash;that the People &s;hould freely contri|bute to the Support of the Go&s;pel now, &amp;c. But I mean not to di&s;cour&s;e this Point here, in as much as I have already done it &s;ome|what largely, in my Book, printed in the Year 1750, holding forth in a Di&s;cour&s;e, the great Privileges of the Church of Je|&s;us
<PB N="80" REF="010621_0077_0F81BAAD4D2904C0">
Chri&s;t, to which I would refer the Read|er for the full Proof of this Point: And &s;o pa&s;s on to hear what this religious Plan &s;aith in this Affair, counter to the Word of God&mdash;which is &s;omething to this Purport &mdash;
<Q>Lord, we do not like your Plan&mdash;for, according to that, long Experience teach|es, that &s;ometimes Mini&s;ters will be pinched for the Want of many Things &mdash;they may &s;uffer Hunger, Cold, Naked|ne&s;s. 2 Cor. 11.28. therefore we chu&s;e to prevent all the&s;e Difficulties. You &s;ay that they &s;hould have no Inheritance with their Brethren (by any legal Bargain) but we do not like that Plan&mdash;we decree that they &s;hall have &s;o much Settlement, and &s;o much Yearly&mdash;near as good a Home Lot, and as fine a Hou&s;e as any in the Society&mdash;we chu&s;e that they &s;hould be as grand, and live as high, and wear as good Cloaths as any in the Society, and appear like honorable Gentlemen.&mdash; Furthermore, your Plan holds forth, that the Mini&s;ter &s;hould live by the free-will Offering of the People; but we think that is high Pre&s;umption&mdash;for by that Rule, three Quarters of our good Mini&s;|ters would &s;tarve, or take to &s;ome other Bu&s;ine&s;s, for to get their Bread: There|fore we are bound by the Law of Pru|dence, in the Exerci&s;e of the utmo&s;t of
<PB N="81" REF="010621_0078_0F81BAAE0D7E8B48">
our Wi&s;dom, to tax every one according to their Li&s;t, in the Compa&s;s of &s;uch Lines as we in our Wi&s;dom have &s;et, to &s;ecure to our Mini&s;ters, the full of their civil Contract, made with the Society's Com|mittee&mdash;and that by the civil Power of the whole Colony, di&s;training of Goods or impri&s;oning the Body, to effect our De&s;ign.</Q>
I note here, that if the Col|lector &s;hould have his Con&s;cience waked up (as has been the Ca&s;e, and may &s;till be) to think it is Oppre&s;&s;ion to &s;train away the Goods, or impri&s;on the Bodies of tho&s;e that never wor&s;hipped with them, nor &s;tand in no Connection with them in religious Mat|ters, or whatever the Difficulty be; if the Collector hath not made up with the Mi|ni&s;ter in two Months after his Salary be|comes due, then the Select Men, or Com|mittees, have Power to take out a Di&s;tre&s;s, legally inve&s;ted with Power to get, out of the Collector's E&s;tate, what is behind, due to the Mini&s;ter. So that the Con&s;titution regards not God, nor Con&s;cience&mdash;they &s;han't &s;top its De&s;ign, &amp;c. But if the Select Men, or Committee, neglect their Duty to the Collectors: And if it &s;hould be by the Light of Truth, &s;hining in their Con&s;ci|ences, &s;hewing that the forcing Men to pay, contrary to their Con&s;ciences, and
<PB N="82" REF="010621_0079_0F81BAAED264D4F0">
where they never contracted, was repug|nant to the Word of God; then they mu&s;t be fined three Pounds. But how &s;hall the&s;e Neglects and Penalties be recovered? Why &s;ince it is of &s;uch a criminal Nature, it mu&s;t be by the King's Attorney, to be &s;ure. See C.L.B. Page 166.
<Q>All which &s;hall be recovered by Action, brought by the King's Attorney, to the County Court, in the &s;ame County, and no Appeal or Review &s;hall be granted in &s;uch Ca&s;e,</Q>
&amp;c. Now, how near this agrees with the Laws of the Medes and Per&s;ians, the Read|er may judge. Al&s;o, how repugnant to Engli&s;h Liberties and Cu&s;toms. I &s;hall clo&s;e this Head by ob&s;erving, that the Man|ner of God's working, in the carrying on the Affairs of his vi&s;ible Kingdom, is by improving the common and &s;pecial Gifts of Grace that he has given to the Children of Men, according to the End for which he has given them. But this Plan counter|works God's Method of working. For In|&s;tance: There may be two Men, equal in E&s;tate, li&s;ted alike; one of them created with a &s;pecial Gift of Ho&s;pitality, and act|ing in the Liberty of his Mind, will give double to the Support of the Go&s;pel, as the other, and the other not to be charged with Covetou&s;ne&s;s. Again, two Men may be
<PB N="83" REF="010621_0080_0F81BAAFA2A85C38">
equal In the Li&s;t&mdash;One thro' the Means of his &s;uperior Gifts of managing civil Affairs, may give as much again as his Neighbour, and not hurt his E&s;tate or Family; and the next Year the &s;ame Man may be equal a|gain in the Li&s;t, and he that gave mo&s;t, be able to give more &s;till, and the other be upon a &s;ick Bed, or thro' the Means of &s;ome cro&s;s Providence, not be able to give any Thing; yet, being equal in the Li&s;t, this Plan has an equal Challenge upon Both; which I think is counter to the Scriptures, and Providence, and well agrees with the Story of the Iron Bed&s;tead, which required all to be cut off that was longer, and all too &s;hort, to be &s;tretched to its Length. &amp;c. I &s;hall now proceed to take another Turn in this Chamber of Imagery.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It is readily granted, that the Word of God is the alone Rule of Faith and Practice. A Church that is de&s;titute of a Pa&s;tor, ought then to have Recour&s;e directly to the Word of God to be in|formed, with the Qualifications which that a&s;&s;erts &s;hall be found in the Man to be &s;et over them in the Lord. And if it &s;hould &s;o happen (as I believe it may again and again, in this Day of dreadful Apo&s;tacy from God and his Word) that the Church cannot light of a Man in the Qualificati|ons
<PB N="84" REF="010621_0081_0F81BAB064D52360">
which the Scriptures gives, &s;o that they are without a preached Go&s;pel a Year or Years, what then? Why this Providence has &s;tripped the poor Flock, of the &s;acred Rights of Con&s;cience, and there is another Head than Chri&s;t impo&s;ed upon them.&mdash; Who &s;hall provide a Mini&s;ter for them? Let Chri&s;t &s;ay what he will, about the Qua|lifications of his Mini&s;ters, or charge his Church never &s;o &s;olemnly to be aware of di&s;qualified Per&s;ons. See the la&s;t cited Page with Page 167.
<Q>And that if any Town or Society, &s;hall be for any Year or Years without a Mini&s;ter preaching the Go&s;pel to them; &s;uch Town or Society &s;hall, in the &s;aid Year or Years, pay &s;uch Sum or Payments as the General Court &s;hall appoint; of which Payment or Payments the Collector, or Collectors, who &s;hall collect the &s;ame, &s;hall make a Certificate to the next County Court, of that Coun|ty, which Court &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of, and im|prove the &s;aid Sums for the U&s;e of the Mini&s;try in the Town or Society where it is collected, as &s;oon as Opportunity may be had for it, according to the Di&s;|cretion of the Court.</Q>
Thus is decreed by the Plan: But if it were needful, I &s;hould inquire, What if Opportunity &s;hould not pre&s;ent for a Year, or more, for the Coun|ty
<PB N="85" REF="010621_0082_0F81BAB113F56FA0">
Court to hire a Man? What is to be done in &s;uch a Ca&s;e? For every Plan ought to reach its own De&s;ign. But this is not &s;o likely to happen, if we con&s;ider how plenty tho&s;e are which this Plan calls and makes Preachers. See 2 Tim. 4.3, 4. "For the Time will come, when they will not endure &s;ound Doctrine; but after their own Lu&s;ts, &s;hall they heap to them&s;elves Teachers, having itching Ears. Ob&s;erve, this Plan hath no Regard to the Scriptures for a Rule to walk by in this Ca&s;e: For the Word of God inve&s;ts the Church with Pow|er to chu&s;e a Man to preach to them; but this Plan, in the Ca&s;e now &s;et forth, inve&s;ts the County Court with that Bu&s;ine&s;s. In|deed it appears to me, that this Plan can keep to them&s;elves as many Teachers as they plea&s;e, if they have but Money enough, and common Sen&s;e or Abilities to learn: And if it &s;hould happen that they fall &s;ome &s;hort of common Sen&s;e, a good Stock of Money will likely &s;upply that Defect; for if you take a fair Pro&s;pect of this Plan, Money is the e&s;&s;ential Foundation, and has the ca&s;ting Vote through the whole Con&s;ti|tution. Therefore, &s;ince the Ca&s;e may be &s;o, that the County Court mu&s;t thru&s;t Mi|ni&s;ters in upon us, whether we will or not, I think it is high Time for all Freemen of

<P N="2">2ly. Once more, and I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this Part of the Plan which the Colony Law Book holds forth. See Pages 153, 154.&mdash; Here the Plan commits the whole Affair of in&s;pecting and ordering the building of Meeting-Hou&s;es for public Wor&s;hip to the County Court. And altho' there be no|thing that effects Con&s;cience, in the Mat|ter of Building, yet there is in the Manner of Building, becau&s;e the Plan requires Force, Taxes, and Pri&s;ons, to effect its De&s;igns, which is contrary to the Word of God.

"And &s;ome of the chief of the Fathers, when they came to the Hou&s;e of the Lord which is at Jeru&s;alem, offered freely, for the Hou&s;e of God, to &s;et it up in his Place." Thus the Scriptures decrees, thro' all the &s;acred Volumns; for perfect Wi&s;|dom never contradicts his own Plan. There is no civil Tax, nor civil Rulers, nor Pri&s;ons concerned in the whole Affair. But this Plan is formed quite a one Side of the Scriptures, and leaves no Room for a proper, &s;criptu|ral Trial, to know whether its Adherents act from Love to God or not, for Love or not Love, party Envy or Hatred, it is all of a Piece with this Plan; for it has found out a Way, if there be Power enough in the Colony, to drive their De&s;igns through, hit or mi&s;s (as we u&s;ed to &s;ay) if there was any Right to u&s;e the civil Sword in the Af|fair, I think they di&s;cover poor Policy, and fiery Zeal to u&s;e it before there is Need: For if the Society agrees to a Man upon the Spot to &s;et their Meeting-Hou&s;e, and pre&s;ume to do it without fir&s;t procuring the Court's Liberty, they incur the Penalty of forty Pounds to the Trea&s;ury, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="010621_0085_0F81BAB3598DFE00">I &s;hould in the next Place, enter upon the Con&s;ideration of Say-brook Plan; but there is two Pieces that &s;tand &s;omething in my Way, which I mu&s;t endeavour to re|move, in order to go &s;treight forward with my De&s;ign. The fir&s;t, an Explanation of Say-brook Platform; the &s;econd an At|tempt to illu&s;trate and confirm the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Con&s;titution, of the con&s;ociated Churches in the Colony of Connecticut, wrote by Mr. Hobart of Fairfield Pa&s;tor of a Church there.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Books, the Pur|port of which is to &s;hew the true Intent of Say-brook Platform, or Plan&mdash;Fir&s;t I &s;hall ob&s;erve and &s;ay, if the Author of this Ex|planation had &s;aid, that the Say-brook Plan ought to have been &s;o compiled as he has explained, he would have &s;aid Something to the Purpo&s;e or what Truth requires; or if there can be &s;uch a Thing in Divini|ty, or in Chri&s;t's &s;piritual Kingdom, that a bad Thing can be made good; then I mu&s;t grant that the Author has done it compleatly. But this is what I much que&s;tion, and cannot yet believe: I rather choo&s;e to believe what Chri&s;t &s;aith in this Ca&s;e, Matth. 12.33. "Either make the Tree good, and his Fruit good; or el&s;e make the Tree corrupt, and his Fruit cor|rupt;
<PB N="89" REF="010621_0086_0F81BAB480FFAD20">
for the Tree is known by his Fruit." Now I will readily grant, that in any Com|po&s;er, whether Articles of Faith or Prac|tice, that when it appears, that there is an accidental Word or Sentence dropped that does not comport with the Whole, it ought to be corrected. But the Ca&s;e is far other|wi&s;e here in my Opinion. Ob&s;erve, here is Articles compiled, plain and explicit; and if they do not agree with the Re&s;t of the Plan, they alone mu&s;t bear it. I can|not like the Method the Author has taken, to make this Plan good. I think by the &s;ame Rule of Proceeding, a Man of his &s;uperior Abilities, may make almo&s;t any corrupt Plan to pa&s;s; for almo&s;t every cor|rupt Plan has Something in them &s;ound and good. Therefore take that which is &s;ound for the Principle, and explain the Re&s;t to comport therewith, and almo&s;t any Thing will pa&s;s, in &s;uch a Way of reconciling Things. But I am inclined to think that the Compilers and Enacters of them Arti|cles, de&s;igned they &s;hould be as they really are expre&s;&s;ed, for two Rea&s;ons.&mdash;Fir&s;t in the Con&s;ideration that the Reverend Coun|cil at Say-brook, was Men, doubtle&s;s of con&s;iderable Abilities, well under&s;tanding Terms and Di&s;tinctions, in Principles, who had been in&s;tructed all their Days, in the
<PB N="90" REF="010621_0087_0F81BAB4D3CC5FE8">
Congregational Principles and Di&s;pcipline; that, had them Principles &s;uited the Coun|cil, there they was compiled to their Hand, and nothing wanted, but to adopt them in as they had the Articles of Faith. But to me it is evident, that the Congregational Plan of Government did not reach their De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Secondly, I have from Time been in|formed, that about that Time Say-brook Plan was agreed upon, and for &s;ome Time before, the Body of the Clergy grew unea&s;y with their Lot, as being Servants to the Churches (as Chri&s;t has appointed their Lot) but cho&s;e rather to be Lords. Therefore them Articles of Di&s;cipline was compiled ju&s;t according to their Spirit and De&s;ign, and added to the Articles of Faith in the congregational Plan. I am further con|firmed in this Opinion, by what I find wrote by Mr. Increa&s;e Mather of Bo&s;ton, in the Year 1700, in a Book, entitled, "The Order of the Churches in New-England vindicated." Page 12.
<Q>If the begun A|po&s;tacy &s;hould proceed as fa&s;t the next thirty Years as it has done the&s;e la&s;t, &s;urely it will come to that in New-Eng|land (except the Go&s;pel it&s;elf depart with the Order of it) that the mo&s;t con&s;ci|entious People therein will think them|&s;elve

concerned to gather Churches out of Churches.</Q>
See al&s;o in Page 8; in both which it appears to me that this god|ly Man had a right Under&s;tanding of them, and the&s;e Times al&s;o, and fore&s;ee what God is now doing in this Reformation, in &s;epa|rating from this Con&s;titution; which Con|&s;titution he then &s;aw in Embryo, but not then brought forth. But to return: The Council at Saybrook, adding that u&s;urp|ing Form of Di&s;cipline to the congreati|onal Plan, is the Cau&s;e (in my humble O|pinion) of all the Contradiction and Blun|der. Indeed, I think the Nature of this, Mr. Hobart has made evident in his Re|ply to this Author: But he is far, very far from making the Application that I do, or con&s;enting to the Ca&s;e that I a&s;&s;ign, &amp;c. But I have a Right to think for my&s;elf, and mu&s;t de&s;cent from the Author and Mr. Hobart too: They both labour to make the Plan good, but in very wide and differ|ing Sen&s;es. And as to each of their ma|king out what they undertook, I think they have both failed of making good their De&s;ign: Yet this I gather from their Wri|tings, that the Author of the Explanation, di&s;covers a Mind to vindicate the congre|gational Principles. I am far from being &s;o uncharitable as Mr. Hobart is, that he
<PB N="92" REF="010621_0089_0F81BAB64D53B288">
intended the De&s;truction of the Con&s;titu|tion. I &s;oberly think the Author errs up|on the other Hand, el&s;e he would never took &s;o much Pains to make a bad Thing good, and try to patch it up, &s;o as to make it &s;tand. It appears to me his principal Aim and De&s;ign was not to altar Nothing in the Con&s;titution, excepting to take a|way the Horns that the Clergy has placed upon their Heads, to pu&s;h all the di&s;ea&s;ed of the Flock, Ezek. 34.21. Al&s;o, lea&s;t they &s;hould grow &s;o &s;turdy and &s;trong as to pu&s;h the civil Authority too, as tho&s;e in their Cloth, in former Ages, have done. Therefore, &s;o far as the Author has vin|dicated the free Liberties of the Churches and People of God, I am willing, from my Heart, that all due Honor &s;hould be conferr'd upon him. But is to Mr. Ho|barts' Writings, they di&s;cover to me that he &s;tands in the very Spirit and Breath of what the Articles of Di&s;cipline hold forth, in the &s;tronge&s;t Manner; which I believe was the very De&s;ign of tho&s;e that e&s;tabli&s;h|ed that Plan, and that he choo&s;es to wear the Horns, becau&s;e they add to his Power and Dignity. And indeed, if his Wi&s;|dom, or tho&s;e that like the Plan, can find out a Way to keep the Horns from hurt|ing their Neighbours, they may wear them
<PB N="93" REF="010621_0090_0F81BAB8D9BB0558">
as long as they like. But from the Spirit that too much governs in the&s;e Per&s;ons, I am jealous that they will not be kept from doing Mi&s;chief. Therefore, upon the Whole, I believe it is be&s;t for the civil Au|thority to break them off timely, lea&s;t they are hurt by them. Yet, notwith&s;tanding my Opinion of Mr. Hobart, in this Ca&s;e, I am willing to refer my Reader to what he has wrote in his Reply to the Author's Ex|planation; &s;hewing that he has entirely mi&s;&s;ed the De&s;ign of the E&s;tabli&s;hers of Saybrook Plan: Connecting of it with what I have briefly ob&s;erved, &s;erves my pre&s;ent De&s;ign, &s;o that I can calmly &s;et it a&s;ide, and go forward, to take into &s;erious Con&s;ideration, Mr. Hobart's Vindication of the &s;ame Plan.</P>
<P>The Reader may ob&s;erve, that when I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion further to note any Thing from the Explanation of the Plat|form, I &s;hall u&s;e the &s;ame Di&s;tinction that I have already done, &s;aying the Author, &amp;c. and when I am replying, or remark|ing upon Mr. Hobart's Book, I &s;hall &s;ay, the Writer, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing that I &s;hall take Notice of in Mr. Hobart's Book, is in P. 5. where he is remarking upon the congregational Go|vernment that, the Author would e&s;tabli&s;h.
<PB N="94" REF="010621_0091_0F81BAB9AD26F1D8">
There, I think, he does not treat Things fairly, but u&s;es Craft and Guile, intimat|ing that the congregational Government was what the Articles of the Saybrook Plan holds forth, viz. that it belongs to the Con&s;ociation, and not the Brotherhood, to determine, and finally judge all eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Matters; and that the Di&s;cipline that the Author pleads for, which our god|ly Forefathers held, is the Browni&s;t's Scheme. This may &s;tartle &s;ome ungrounded Per|&s;ons, and &s;o make Pro&s;elytes to his Scheme, and all through an unju&s;t Repre&s;entation of the Matter. I under&s;tand the Di&s;tinction thus; Congregationali&s;ts a Sect of Inde|pendants, between Pre&s;byterians and Brown|i&s;ts, &amp;c. What is the Pre&s;byterian Go|vernment? By the Church's Officers, Pa&s;|tor and Lay-Elders, excluding the Bro|therhood. What is the Browni&s;t's Prin|ciples? An&s;wer. As I under&s;tand them, they hold the Power, in every Re&s;pect, in the Brotherhood, and are &s;o rigid, as to de|ny all &s;i&s;ter Relation to any Church under Heaven; not allowing their Elders to ad|mini&s;ter but of the Church that they have the Charge of; denying Councils of Church|es, &amp;c. The Congregationali&s;ts are be|tween them in this Re&s;pect; they hold, that all Power is in the Brotherhood al&s;o.
<PB N="95" REF="010621_0092_0F81BABA5AD8A670">
But then they hold a Si&s;ter-Relation with other Churches, in the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion; a Communion together in each other's Gra|ces and Gifts; and, when there is Need, a Council of Churches, to give Coun&s;el and Advice, in any difficult Ca&s;e, and no fur|ther. What then is the Plan the Writer is labouring to e&s;tabli&s;h? An&s;. I under&s;tand it thus: The Pa&s;tor of a Church has Pow|er to negative the whole Church, and then to take the Ca&s;e out of the Church, and carry it to the Con&s;ociation; and the Bre|thren have no more to do in the Ca&s;e, but to be finally i&s;&s;ued in the Council. But who are the Actors in the Council? Why the Clergy only. Indeed there is Me&s;&s;en|gers there, but they are only as &s;o many Cyphers, except it be to wait upon their Pa&s;tors. Thus &s;tands the Ca&s;e: And I think this Plan robs the Church of their Right, as much, if not more, than the Pre&s;byterian Order: for they allow the Laity to act in their Di&s;cipline, but this allows none but Clergymen to make their deci&s;ive Judgment. And yet the Writer would fain in&s;inuate into his Reader's Mind, that the Plan he is a pleading for, is Con|gregational, when, in Fact, it is as far re|mote as the Pre&s;byterian, if not, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, farther. It is nothing to the
<PB N="96" REF="010621_0093_0F81BABACC560138">
Writer's Purpo&s;e to &s;ay, that the Council is a Con&s;ociation of Churches, becau&s;e the Me&s;&s;enger, or Laity, are excluded from Power of Action, in the&s;e deci&s;ive Coun|cils, as I &s;hall &s;how in its Place.</P>
<P>Again, in this 5th Page, the Writer &s;aith,
<Q>The Churches of Connecticut had, for more than half a Century, made Trial of that loo&s;e Form of Government &amp; Di&s;ci|pline which this Writer (meaning the Au|thor of the Explanation) would now re|commend to us, &amp; they found by &s;ad Ex|perience, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to main|tain Purity, good Order and Peace, on that Plan.</Q>
But I would hope the Writer will not be offended, if we &s;u&s;pend the Be|lief of this A&s;&s;ertion till &s;ome proper Proof is produced to make it evident. For it is well known by all that was acquainted with the Churches under that loo&s;e Government (as he is plea&s;ed to call it) and that know the&s;e Times, that the Ca&s;e, in Fact, is quite the Rever&s;e: The Churches was much more pure and peaceable then, beyond what they be now. I could produce a Multitude of Facts to make this evident, were it needful; but rather than &s;well my Book, I choo&s;e to refer my Reader to the Hon. Roger Woolcott, late Governor of this Colony, in a Letter he wrote to Mr.
<PB N="97" REF="010621_0094_0F81BAC0DD612DE0">
Hobart, the Writer, upon this very Point; which Letter I earne&s;tly recommend to the Peru&s;al of all, for I think it ought to be taken Notice of in Honor to his Memory; that in &s;uch an advanced Age that he had arrived to, when he wrote that Letter, he &s;hould give &s;uch a clear Witne&s;s to the Truth, again&s;t the Tyranny that the Wri|ter is labouring to have continued over the Churches.</P>
<P>Again, the Writer, &s;hewing the Cau&s;e why the&s;e Articles now in Debate, was in|troduced, &s;aith,
<Q>The leading Men, both in Church and State, &s;aw and lamented the Confu&s;ions they were brought into,</Q>
&amp;c. This is doubtle&s;s true; and I am quite willing that the Writer &s;hould take all the Advantage and Honor that ari&s;es therefrom, to him&s;elf; only I would note upon it, that proud, ambitious Men, being cro&s;&s;ed in their a&s;piring De&s;igns, are u&s;ual|ly flung into Confu&s;ion and Perplexity; Witne&s;s proud Haman, &amp;c. Now the Di&s;cipline then, in being in the Church|es, &s;erved to check and curb &s;uch a&s;pir|ing Minds. But I will venture to &s;ay, and likely in as much truth, as the Writer, and in more Propriety, that the good Men in that Day, yea, the truly godly, and mo&s;t &s;piritual, was in Di&s;tre&s;s, and great

Concern for the Churches: Witne&s;s Mr. Mather's Writings, Mr. Wi&s;e, and Others. Di&s;cour&s;ing in the leading Men, both in Church and State (which my Antagoni&s;t meant) an a&s;piring Spirit, to rob the Church of her riche&s;t Trea&s;ure, and &s;o bring her into Slavery; which, in Fact, is awfully brought to pa&s;s, in this religious Con&s;ti|tution (which I am labouring to uncover, and hold up in View of the rational Mind.) For &s;ee how is the Churches Prie&s;t-ridden, in many Places. When there is any Thing to be tran&s;acted, the Mini&s;ter leads for|ward, which is his proper Work; but then he propo&s;es and draws up the Re&s;ult, and finally i&s;&s;ues the Ca&s;e, all in and from him|&s;elf (of what is acted in the Church.) And where is the Church? Why they &s;et (not as the Spou&s;e of Chri&s;t, that has &s;worn to exerci&s;e her&s;elf, with all the Powers of Mind, and the Members of her Body, to &s;hew her cha&s;t Love and Loyalty to her exalted Head and Hu&s;band, 1 Cor. 6.20.) but as a Company of Underlings or Slaves, almo&s;t afraid to &s;ay that their Souls are their own, with their Tongue within their Teeth, and their Hands u&s;ele&s;s, and Si|lence does all on the Church's Part, and the Seats they &s;it upon does ju&s;t as much. And if it &s;hould &s;o happen, that a Brother

Here in &s;hort I think, is the true State of the Ca&s;e in &s;ome Churches. I mu&s;t intreat my Reader not to be offend|ed with me for &s;etting Things in their own Light&mdash;but view it well, and &s;ee if it com|ports with the Scripture Character of the Church of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>To come to the Ca&s;e in Hand. The Writer has laid down four Propo&s;itions, as a Foundation to e&s;tabli&s;h his Building up|on. I mean not to take them in their Cour&s;e to reply to, for that will make my Piece too long. I &s;hall endeavour to take a &s;horter Method, and purpo&s;e fir&s;t to di&s;|charge my Artillery, and forthwith &s;torm the Fort, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To proceed. The Writer has undertook
<PB N="100" REF="010621_0097_0F81BAC3D35003F8">
to prove, that there is two Churches in|&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, one inferior, the other &s;uperior; the inferior Church is a &s;mall Body of Chri&s;tians, congregated together to wor&s;hip God in private Hou&s;es, and al&s;o may exerci&s;e &s;ome Di&s;cipline, but not to determine the Ca&s;e finally; but to be car|ried to the &s;uperior Church, which is, as he &s;aith, a Con&s;ociation of Churches, made out of the&s;e &s;mall Churches: Which &s;upe|rior Church is to hear all Cau&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal, judge and finally determine the &s;ame. Al&s;o that the&s;e two di&s;tinct Bodies are known in the Scripture by one Name; the Church in the &s;ingle Ten&s;e. Hence the Writer in his Way and Manner, with a great Deal of Craft and Sophi&s;try, pre&s;umes to make out the Being of the&s;e two Churches, from the Scriptures, &amp;c. I ob&s;erve as to the Word Church, being ver&s;ed in Scripture, to denote two Bodies, I readily grant; but not in the Sen&s;e the Writer means, that I utterly deny; neither has he brought a Scrap of Proof, but what he has &s;pun out of his own Bowels, to make out his Scheme. Search the Scriptures, and you may find, the Word Church, is u&s;ed to de&s;cribe a &s;ingle Congregation of Saints, be they more or le&s;s, covenanted together to main|tain the Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t's

<P>Now according to my Purpo&s;e, I &s;hall &s;torm this Fort, and enter at the Gap the Writer has left. See Page 30. "There are &s;ome Texts which repre&s;ent the church as having the Power of Di&s;cipline; when yet it cannot be certainly determined from any Thing in the context in what Sen&s;e the Word Church is u&s;ed.

that Name, &amp;c." Here Reader, allow me to u&s;e Plainne&s;s for my Heart is fil|led with Pain in di&s;covering what craft and &s;ophi&s;try the Writer u&s;es, to &s;hun the Truth and to e&s;tabli&s;h his darling Scheme; for if you mind, he would fain in&s;inuate into his Readers Mind, that this Text is &s;o ge|neral, that it is difficult to tell from the context the true Meaning; only as it may be taken to e&s;tabli&s;h both the churches his &s;cheme has made; when in Truth there is nothing more familiar, plain and explicit, than this Text, and context, expre&s;&s;ive of Chri&s;t's Mind and Will to his Church, as one individual Body, congregated to|gether to attend upon the Laws he has or|dained to be carefully ob&s;erved, for the Health, Unity, and Pre&s;ervation of the Body. Pray ob&s;erve how plain and fami|liar Chri&s;t's Directions are, re&s;pecting the Rule of Duty in the Government of his church, both in the fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third Step, and fixes the la&s;t Judgment in the church, &s;aying, <HI>Verily I &s;ay unto you</HI> (but what you? a Number of con&s;ociated churches, with their mini&s;ters in council: No, no, the Text knows nothing about &s;uch a church, but you Brethren that have &s;olemnly covenanted to walk together in all the Laws and Ordinances of my Hou&s;e) <HI>what&s;oever ye &s;hall bind on Earth,

<P>Therefore if I may be allowed in Meek|ne&s;s to u&s;e &s;cripture Language, I &s;hall &s;ay, the Fox has cro&s;&s;ed his Track, and got catched in the Trap of impregnable Truth, and will be held fa&s;t. For as a Fox that &s;mells a Trap is affraid of being catched therein, &s;teps with Fear; but ere he is a|ware, &s;teps his Foot right in the Trap, and is catched. Thus the writer had got to a critical Spot, and would fain have pa&s;&s;ed it, but has &s;tepped right into it, and Truth has caught him. For in the Pa&s;&s;age la&s;t cited, he goes on and &s;aith, "And as it is evident that particular wor&s;hipping A&s;|&s;emblies, are called churches in &s;cripture; it includes them; nay, &s;ince the&s;e are the churches which private chri&s;tians are mo&s;t acquainted with, and can with the greate&s;t Ea&s;e apply to, it may be allowed, that the Direction primarily intends &s;uch churches." Thus Reader, you may &s;ee, the Writer is come to a final clo&s;e with his new formed church, erected in &s;uch &s;uperiority and &s;overeign Power, over the church of Chri&s;t,
<PB N="104" REF="010621_0101_0F81BA02521E6998">
for he here confe&s;&s;es that Chri&s;t primarily intended to commit this power of binding and loo&s;ing to a &s;ingle church, then it fol|loweth, that the writer mu&s;t own, that Je|&s;us Chri&s;t never intended to contradict him|&s;elf, and place a church with &s;uperior power (over this that he has put the la&s;t &s;entence, and that by his decree) &s;o as to revoke the &s;entence thus pa&s;&s;ed. Thus I think that the writers whole &s;cheme is fap|ed at the roots; or to repeat a military figure that I have u&s;ed, the ca&s;tle is &s;torm'd and taken. But if the writer &s;hould be fond of this new formed church, notwith|&s;tanding what has been &s;aid, I think he mu&s;t know that it has lo&s;t its grandeur and power. For let the number, be more or le&s;s con&s;ociated together in council, they are obliged by the writer's own confe&s;&s;ion to knuckle, and come down &amp; fall in the rear, and have their works tried by the indivi|dual churches that they re&s;pectively belong to; becau&s;e Je&s;us Chri&s;t has inve&s;ted every church with power to deal with their own members, and to pa&s;s the final &s;entence up|on the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. In order for the writer's making out this &s;uperior church, I think it is nece&s;|&s;ary to prove from the &s;criptures by &s;ome certain facts, that tho&s;e &s;mall churches that

But not any di&s;cipline I pre&s;ume can be found was ever exerci&s;ed in them hou&s;es, &s;aluted as churches. The writer has &s;hewn none. I have &s;earched every pa&s;&s;age he has cited, and find nothing of that nature&mdash;but the &s;criptures are free for every one to &s;earch; therefore I advi&s;e my reader to &s;earch care|fully, to know for your&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. I think it is nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o for him to &s;hew that there is &s;uch a church in&s;titu|ted by Chri&s;t, &s;uperior to the other inve&s;ted with power to pa&s;s a final &s;entence, &amp;c. The texts the writer has bro't proves no &s;uch a church as he would; and before I can fall in with that opinion, I mu&s;t find from &s;cripture record, when the&s;e &s;mall churches meet, the time and place to form this council, a church over them&s;elves, in &s;uperiority, and who was athori&s;ed to &s;end out the letters mi&s;&s;ive, and who was the me&s;&s;enger to carry the &s;ame, and when met what cau&s;es they tried, and what their &s;en|tence was, &amp;c. For if we mu&s;t be informed about Paul's cloak, and no record of &s;uch a grand council, inve&s;ted with power from Chri&s;t, to tran&s;act the mo&s;t important af|fairs that re&s;pects Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible kingdom here on earth. This is too unaccountable for me to believe as yet!</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="106" REF="010621_0103_0F81BA03F3F59320">4thly. The writer to make out his two churches, is obliged to do it by conjectures, &s;uppo&s;itions, &amp;c. Hence from this &s;andy bottom he &s;hews their being &s;o many con|verts in Jeru&s;alem, and a time of per&s;ecu|tion, that they was obliged to meet in &s;mall bodies in private hou&s;es (which was the inferior churches) and to tran&s;act their weighty affairs to meet in a con&s;ociation of the&s;e &s;mall churches, to make one &s;uperior church, and if &s;o, altho' the per&s;ecution had been very hot, they could with pru|dence make it out pretty well. For this grand church could get into a pretty &s;mall place, a great deal le&s;s than tho&s;e &s;mall churches could meet in; for he allows they may contain two or three hundred, and the churches &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;even; and &s;even churches to &s;end their pa&s;tor and two me&s;|&s;engers makes but 21, there is no more wanting, but the complainer and offender with their evidence, which added to the council, probably would not make out more than 30, and it is quite likely that a poor man's hou&s;e would do for them. But I think the writer has made a mi&s;s in his conjectures, and &s;ince his whole building &s;tands upon &s;uch a bottom, I think it would have &s;hown his cunning, to let his thoughts have penetrated a little further, to &s;ee how
<PB N="107" REF="010621_0104_0F81BA0493D262F8">
his conjectures would meet in the clo&s;e, and not betrayed his weekne&s;s. For ob|&s;erve, he allows the&s;e inferior churches to be about &s;even, and to contain about three hundred at the mo&s;t, to make one a&s;&s;embly; which makes 2100; and it is certain that there was only one &s;ingle body congregated together for divine and public wor&s;hip, out of which 3000 was converted, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.41, 46. <HI>Continuing with one accord in the temple</HI>&mdash; But the writer conjectures, that they met in that day, in a private, or a poor man's hou&s;e. Now it matters not where they meet, &s;ince they was together in one place, not con&s;ociated by delegation; and if I may be allowed to conjecture, as well as the writer, I &s;hould think it po&s;&s;ible, if not probable, that a third, if not half of the&s;e &s;even a&s;&s;emblies was not church members, and deduct but a third out, and there re|mains 1400. Again, on the other hand&punc; I may rea&s;onably conclude, that that a&s;|&s;embly contained &s;ome thou&s;ands be&s;ides what was converted, for there was many that mocked, and doubtle&s;s many that was a &s;ort of neuters, and many that was under &s;ome convictions, and not converted; all which is common in a great a&s;&s;embly, where the power of God is di&s;played a|mong&s;t a mixed multitude. But be this as it will, 3000 and more was certainly
<PB N="108" REF="010621_0105_0F81BA054D948448">
convened in one &s;pot for divine wor&s;hip. Therefore putting all together, the writer's own conjecture of the &s;um total of tho&s;e &s;mall churches makes but 2100. So that here is room enough left for the church to grow a great deal, and tran&s;act all her affairs, and no nece&s;&s;ity of a con&s;ociation of churches, &amp;c. But as to the&s;e &s;mall churches in private hou&s;es, I rather think there the &s;aints meet at times in chri&s;tian conferences, and for &s;ocial wor&s;hip, be|ing part of the church a&s;&s;embled together in a place, and not the whole church. So that part is called the church; for, el&s;e|where the &s;cripture &s;peaks of the whole church meeting together, <HI>Acts</HI> 15, 22, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14, 23. Which was to judge and tran&s;act weighty matters. But in the&s;e hou&s;es, &s;aluted as a church, doubtle&s;s there was &s;ocial wor&s;hip attended that did not need the whole church, &amp;c. But if I am mi&s;taken in this matter, it makes not one way nor the other, ina&s;much as there is clear facts in &s;cripture, that particular churches was inve&s;ted with power by Je&s;us Chri&s;t their head, to deal with their di&s;|orderly members and proceed to pa&s;s the la&s;t &s;entence of rejection, &amp;c. Did I like the bu&s;ine&s;s, I could ea&s;ily follow the writer in every part of his performance, and di&s;cover his craft, and take off the

fal&s;e glo&s;s he has ca&s;t over it; but I choo&s;e to leave it to tho&s;e that like the bu&s;ine&s;s better than I do. And only add, two pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, to that in the 18th of Mat. which I humbly conceive is &s;uf|ficient to confront all gain&s;ayers what&s;o|ever, &s;ee 1 Cor. 5, notwith&s;tanding the writers vain and fruitle&s;s conjectures upon this chap. that this was a con&s;ociated church, the chapter is able to &s;peak for it|&s;elf. Ob&s;erve Paul's &s;alutation unto the church of God, which is at Corinth, called to be &s;aints, chap. 1.2. Note here, not called to office or to be officers, no, but &s;aints, which means a church made up of brethern, and that this church is a number of brethern in covenant bonds to God and each other (and not a cla&s;&s;ical church) is evident by the three la&s;t ver&s;es of the 5th chapt. where Paul directs how one brother &s;hall deal with another; perfectly agree|ing with Chri&s;t's direction in the 18th of Mat. Al&s;o &s;hews the di&s;tinction between a brother in covenant, and one that is not. There cannot be a church proce&s;s again&s;t a per&s;on that is not a member, but tho&s;e that are in covenant, and the &s;candalous, the brethern are obliged from Chri&s;t's and Paul's direction, to follow, till repentance or an exclu&s;ion from the church. That
<PB N="110" REF="010621_0107_0F81BA06D4EC27C8">
this church was not a con&s;ociated church, is further evident in the 12th chap. in the which Paul gives de&s;cription of the church as a natural body, con&s;i&s;ting of many members, and in the de&s;cription he takes in the female, as well as the male, as may be &s;een in the foregoing chap. and chap. 14.34. Now how the writer will do with the females in his council, is for him to &s;ay. Again, ob&s;erve the 14th chap. 23. the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of the whole church meeting together for &s;ocial wor&s;hip; there|fore it confirms the point that the church of Corinth was but one body, altho' they might meet in &s;mall companies in private hou&s;es for &s;ome conveniency at times; yet they all come together in one place to make one whole body, &amp;c. 2dly. Rev. 2.2. Here we have certain facts a&s;&s;erted, a per&s;on tried by the church, the facts charged made out. But the writer &s;aith, this is a con&s;ociated church; and where comes his evidence? why, there is nothing appears, but that it came from the &s;ame &s;ource, as all the re&s;t, &s;pun out of his own imagination. For ob&s;erve Chri&s;t's &s;aluta|tion to the church. <HI>Unto the angel of the church,</HI> &amp;c. not to the angels of the church|es, met together, a con&s;ociated church: No, mind Chri&s;t's charge again&s;t the church,

Therefore to clo&s;e all my remarks upon the writers high church above the church. For to &s;uppo&s;e that it is in the power of one church or more to make another, and that &s;uperior to it&s;elf, or them, I &s;oberly think it is re|pugnant to the word of God, to &s;ound or right rea&s;on, and the very law of nature. Therefore properly &s;peaking it is jargon&mdash; I dont under&s;tand it&mdash;and the clergyman that has formed it, may &s;hare all the glory of it to him&s;elf. And may the Lord God Almighty, have mercy upon him, and acquaint him with Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the character he has given of his Dear Spou&s;e, bought with his blood; and al&s;o what is required of the man that Chri&s;t has quali|fied to be a &s;ervant to his church. So I di&s;mi&s;s the writer.</P>
<P>Having removed the&s;e two pieces, or blocks out of my way, I &s;hall return to the chambers of imagery, for further &s;earch, and &s;o take notice of a few things there, and then di&s;mi&s;s the &s;earch. Therefore, what remains for me to con&s;ider, is to make
<PB N="112" REF="010621_0109_0F81BA0C8DCB4BB8">
&s;ome &s;hort remarks upon the articles of di&s;cipline, formed for a rule of practice in the latter end of Saybrook confe&s;&s;ion or plan. Here I would fir&s;t refer the reader to what I have already wrote upon the&s;e articles in my book, printed in the year 1750; in which performance I have examined all the &s;criptures brought to &s;upport the&s;e 15 articles, and &s;hewn that they have no foundation from the &s;crip|tures; but are founded upon the &s;ands of men's inventions; and there I have le&s;t them for the rain and wind of divine truth to beat upon for their overthrow in due time. Therefore to add &s;omewhat thereto in this performance. I &s;hall fir&s;t take notice of the 14th article, page 115. "That the &s;aid a&s;&s;ociated pa&s;tors, &s;hall al&s;o be con&s;ulted by bereaved churches, belonging to their a&s;&s;ociation, and recommend to &s;uch churches, &s;uch per&s;ons as may be fit to be called and &s;ettled in the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try among them. And if &s;uch bereaved churches &s;hall not &s;ea&s;onably call and &s;ettle a mini&s;ter among them, the &s;aid a&s;&s;ociated pa&s;tors &s;hall lay the &s;tate of &s;uch bereaved churches before the general a&s;&s;em|bly of this colony, that they may take &s;uch orders concerning them, as &s;hall be found nece&s;&s;ary for their peace and edification."</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="010621_0110_0F81BA0D4D242E78">I &s;hall con&s;ider the two mea&s;ures this article propo&s;es for a bereaved church to get or have a mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, a bereaved church is obliged to go to this council for a mini&s;ter, be the ca&s;e how it will; if the bigger part of the council &s;hould be enemies to the power of godline&s;s, it makes no odds with this plan, or if the church, has the knowledge of one qualified according to the go&s;pel, and the council does nor &s;ee fit to advi&s;e to him, it is all up with the church, as to that man; and then they mu&s;t be at the a&s;&s;o|ciation's direction, to go from Dan to Ber&s;heba, or place to place, and ride po&s;t a great while perhaps, and be at great expence&mdash;and at length they get a man upon trial, which &s;hews him&s;elf by his conver&s;ation and public performance as ig|norant of any &s;aving knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his &s;pirit's work upon the hearts of men, as when he was born: yea, upon clo&s;e conver&s;ation with him, a meer enemy to the power of godline&s;s. But to be &s;hort, the church mu&s;t be under the council's thumb, the man they &s;ay, or none. Here the church is &s;tript of her &s;acred and mo&s;t valuable right. For altho' this article &s;eems to have a friendly look, and concern for the bereaved church, and &s;eems to offer
<PB N="114" REF="010621_0111_0F81BA0D98365570">
help by way of advice. Yet this vi&s;age is taken off by and by; for if the poor be|reaved church, to keep a cha&s;te con&s;cience is obliged to refu&s;e the men directed to by the council; then this council in their friendly pretence of concern for the be|reaved church, acquaints the general a&s;|&s;embly with their ca&s;e. But why the gene|ral a&s;&s;embly? they are a civil court, God's mini&s;ters in the civil kingdom. No matter for that, &s;ays this plan, we have not the civil &s;word, nor power to force our mini|&s;ters upon the churches; therefore we want their help to effect our de&s;igns. The a&s;&s;embly can &s;hift places as they plea&s;e, and &s;et half a day as God's mini&s;ters, for our good in the civil kingdom, and the other half con&s;titute them&s;elves a &s;piritual court, and carry all our de&s;igns thro' &amp;c.</P>
<P>Therefore &s;econdly, the general a&s;&s;embly becoming a &s;piritual body, can &s;ay who &s;hall be a church of Chri&s;t, and who not; where men &s;hall wor&s;hip God, and where not; who &s;hall preach the go&s;pel, and who not; and order concerning a bereaved church, as &s;hall be, for their peace and edification, &s;aith the article. Well, but how doth the general a&s;&s;embly order for their peace and edification? An&s;wer, you may &s;ee in the other part of the plan,
<PB N="115" REF="010621_0112_0F81BA0E4F900628">
that &s;tands connected with this. C. L. B. page 166 and 167. There &s;hall be &s;uch &s;ums of money rai&s;ed, as the a&s;&s;embly &s;hall appoint, and be committed to the county court, to hire a man, and thru&s;t him upon the &s;ociety and church, altho' the church be never &s;o oppo&s;ite thereto. And &s;uch mini&s;ters have their character drawn by infinite wi&s;dom, John 10, 1.10.&mdash;<HI>The &s;ame is a thief and a robber&mdash;the thief cometh not but for to &s;teal and to kill, and to de&s;troy.</HI> Now reader, when man in the right exer|ci&s;e of his rea&s;on, can think that this plan is for the peace and edification of the church, to be thus tyrannized over, except he be in the papi&s;t principles? But that my dear neighbours may &s;ee them&s;elves, I mu&s;t turn them to &s;ee the flat contradic|tion there is in their plan. See confe&s;&s;ion of faith, page 65. "God alone is Lord of the con&s;cience, and hath left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men: &s;o that to believe &s;uch doctrines or to obey &s;uch commands out of con&s;cience, is to betray true liberty of con&s;cience." page 66. "But the acceptable way of wor&s;hipping the true God, is in&s;tituted by him&s;elf, and &s;o limitted by his own re|vealed will, that he may not be wor&s;hipped according to the imaginations and devices
<PB N="116" REF="010621_0113_0F81BA0F10674F70">
of men, &amp;c." Here I would ob&s;erve to tho&s;e that are zealous for the con&s;titution, and take offence at my writing. In the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages is contained the whole of all that I would be after, and contending earne&s;tly for, with mini&s;ters and rulers. Indeed the&s;e lines now cited out of your articles are worthy to be written in letters of gold. But how extremely contrary hereto is all our eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws? and how flat is the contradiction between the&s;e articles of faith, and your practice in forming &s;ocie|ties, and churches &s;ettling and &s;upporting mini&s;ters? I will venture to &s;ay, it will puzzel and out-do the wi&s;dom of a <HI>Solomon</HI> to reconcile the &s;everal parts of your plan, and make it con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, or the word of God. I &s;uppo&s;e the author to the explanation of Saybrook plan, thought he had done the bu&s;ine&s;s. But how came he to pa&s;s by in total &s;ilence all the eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal laws? Who but him&s;elf can tell? I am ready to gue&s;s that if he glanced his mind upon them laws, he knew it was beyond him or an angel, to reconcile them with tho&s;e articles, which he took to rai&s;e his &s;uper&s;tructure upon, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Secondly, I &s;hall take &s;ome notice of the 12th article which is but a branch of the &s;ame corrupt tree, a little nearer the root.
<PB N="117" REF="010621_0114_0F81BA0FCEB2E8B0">
See the la&s;t clau&s;e of the article, "Who al&s;o &s;hall have power of examining and re|commending the candidates of the mini|&s;ters to the work thereof, &amp;c. But what is the examination? Likely in general, what proficiency they have made in their learning&mdash;what knowledge in logic, or in geography, or in head divinity, or &s;ome|thing remote from the thing. Not are you converted&mdash;give a narrative of your experience&mdash;let us know upon what you found your hope&mdash;what have you experi|enced under the law work&mdash;what manife&s;|tations have you had of the way or life by Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;or what knowledge have you got of the Holy Spirit's work upon the hearts of the godly, in its different ope|rations&mdash;al&s;o, what acquaintance with the mi&s;tery of iniquity's working&mdash;&s;atan in his angelic light, to en&s;nare &s;ouls&mdash;or do you know of the &s;cripture qualifications for church member&s;hip, and the qualifica|tions for her officers&mdash;how the church is built&mdash;what are her ordinances, and how &s;he is governed, &amp;c. Now, if I have been informed right, there is nothing of this nature pa&s;&s;es in the examination of a candidate for the mini&s;try, I was in|formed once, that a godly me&s;&s;enger pro|pounded the que&s;tion to a young candi|date,
<PB N="118" REF="010621_0115_0F81BA112D3B8B48">
whether he was converted or not, and he replied, to the godly father, it is none of your bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o it ended, I have been informed, that &s;ome of the&s;e councils &s;ay, that they have no bu&s;ine&s;s to examine the&s;e candidates, whether they be converted or not; that would offer an af|front to &s;uch a young gentleman, to a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;tion: And indeed viewing their appearance, temper and frame of &s;pirit they di&s;cover, it looks likely to me, to be &s;o. Now, if it &s;hould be &s;o in fact, then the main and principal thing that &s;hews a man to have the e&s;&s;ential qualifications for the mini&s;try, mu&s;t not be &s;ought after. Wherefore I think it is high time for the churches in this colony to wake up to pur|po&s;e, &amp; rea&s;&s;ume their ju&s;t rights and pri|vileges, and take it out of the hands of the clergy, who now reign as Lords over them, as this article te&s;tifies, by which the church is robbed of every mini&s;ter, but what they &s;ee fit to licence.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I mu&s;t come to the center where they form their tribunal, in order to make the &s;upreme court, that, &s;hall pa&s;s the final &s;entence upon the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or; &s;ee page 111, "that according to the com|mon practice of our churches, no thing &s;hall be deemed an act or judgment of any

council, which hath not the major part of the elders pre&s;ent concurring, and &s;uch a number of the me&s;&s;engers pre&s;ent, as make the majority of the council. &amp;c. Ob&s;erve the craft and falacy that is u&s;ed to intro|duce this article, as tho' it had been the common and &s;tated practice of the church|es, to be governed by the major vote of the elders or clergy: when in fact, it was repugnant to their principles and practice, which Cambridge platform &s;hew|eth. But however, it would &s;erve to blind the eyes of tho&s;e, that are willingly blind|ed; and appear with that face as tho' that wi&s;e and reverend council, was not a go|ing to impo&s;e any thing new upon them; till in fact, the halter was &s;lipped over the churches neck, and the mini&s;ters hold the end of it to this day. There is here and there one, that is partly waked up to feel that the halter hurts them, and they complain about it, but all to no purpo&s;e, &s;eeing they like the con&s;titution, they mu&s;t bear the gall of the halter as well as they can. To return, ob&s;erve the article fix|es the government in the major part of the elders pre&s;ent concurring. What propriety then can there be in &s;aying any thing about the me&s;&s;engers more or le&s;s, for the court is already con&s;tituted with all its members,
<PB N="120" REF="010621_0117_0F81BA1267E48A28">
that is inve&s;ted with power to give the final &s;entence, as the next article &s;hews? but I could not but &s;mile in my &s;elf, when I was reading the author of the explanation of this plan, when he came to this article; I thought that notwith&s;tanding all his &s;u|perior abilities, here he got graveled, to make out his congregational plan the chain got broke, and he could not join it toge|ther only by &s;ome queries, finally leaving it to others to con&s;ider and determine &amp;c. Indeed it appears to me, that the compilers of the&s;e articles intended to exclude the brethren intirely out of the government of the church or council; for ob&s;erve, how indifferently and &s;litely they treat the me&s;|&s;engers from time to time, in the&s;e articles. Ob&s;erve this article, "provided that if any &s;uch church, &s;hall not &s;ee cau&s;e to &s;end any me&s;&s;engers to the council, or the per|&s;ons cho&s;en by them &s;hall not attend, nei|ther of the&s;e &s;hall be any ob&s;truction &amp;c." So al&s;o in the foregoing article, &s;peaking of the church &s;aith, "if they &s;ee cau&s;e to &s;end me&s;&s;engers." Again, in the tenth article, &s;hewing how much the council &s;hall be formed to act in their high digni|ty, &s;ay, "and notify the &s;aid time and place to the elders and churches of that county, who &s;hall attend at the &s;ame, the elders,

No, it is my fix|ed principle as I under&s;tand Chri&s;t in the 18th of Mat. that there is no eccle&s;ia&s;tical power or court above a church of Chri&s;t, or to &s;ummons a church of Chri&s;t to an&s;wer to, under the whole heavens.

But let us rea&s;on the point a little&mdash;if the &s;ociety members have the right to choo&s;e the mi|ni&s;ter, than the church has not. But if the church has the right, the &s;ociety have not. For the church and &s;ociety are two di&s;tinct bodies. So in their nature and formation, the one is qualified to act by money, and the other by a vi&s;ible profe&s;&s;ion of faith in Chri&s;t; and perfect wi&s;dom has never pla|ced the&s;e bodies in that po&s;ition, which tends to de&s;troy his churches right of choice or acting in his rule. But you may &s;ay, they &s;hould unite together in their choice&mdash; an&s;wer, What if the &s;ociety refu&s;es to join with the church, who can help in &s;uch a ca&s;e? or if they vote together, and upon trial, the church members and &s;ociety mem|bers are equal and their be a tie, what &s;hall be done? or if the &s;ociety has the vote, who in the exerci&s;e of right rea&s;on and knowledge of the truth, can think that a money qualification &s;hall either rob the church of Chri&s;t of her ju&s;t right, or force a man upon her contrary to her judgment, both which is ab&s;urd and unrea&s;onable? therefore it remains the churches right to choo&s;e her own mini&s;ters, and that from Scripture and rea&s;on; for &s;he is obliged in

I would in meekne&s;s advi&s;e tho&s;e that make the objec|tion, to look well at home fir&s;t, and get things rectified and made rea&s;onable there before he faults his neighbour; for in my plan, there is no force, nor civil power con|cerned in the ca&s;e; neither is there any injury done to any man's civil intere&s;t, nor con&s;cience in this whole plan that I am &s;o earne&s;tly contending for.&mdash;The church of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, wants no man's attention or pur&s;e further than he is plea&s;ed to act and give.

Ob|jection 2. By your plan mini&s;ters ought not to make any civil contract with the people, nor any tax be made for their &s;upport, nor civil powers to be concerned in the whole affair; and if &s;o, our good mini&s;ters will be &s;tarved out of their pulpits, and we &s;hall
<PB N="138" REF="010621_0135_0F81BA25EE4B5950">
have no regular mini&s;ters nor churches in the Land in a few years.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I have &s;ufficiently an&s;wered the fir&s;t part of this objection, and &s;hewn from the &s;criptures that mini&s;ters have no precept nor example in all the bible, to make any civil contract with the people for their &s;upport: nor have civil rulers any direction from God's word, to put forth civil power in that affair; &s;o that it will be time enough for me to make a further re|ply, when the force of my arguments are taken off, and I am &s;hewn wherein I have perverted the &s;criptures that I have brought to vindicate my principles in this affair.</P>
<P>But let us attend a little to the &s;econd part of the objection, viz. our good mini|&s;ters will &s;tarve &amp;c. It is likely tho&s;e that make the objection, little think what is fairly contained in it, for if the mini&s;ters be good, then it reproaches the wi&s;dom and power and faithfulne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that he &s;hould &s;et up mini&s;ters and leave them to &s;tarve in his work. It intimates that Chri&s;t has got carele&s;s of his cau&s;e, and not true to his word, all which is mo&s;t abomi|nably wicked. Chri&s;t &s;aith in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.19 20. <HI>Go ye therefore and teach, teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I have command|ed
<PB N="139" REF="010621_0136_0F81BA2656C0F380">
you: and lo, I am with you always even un|to the end of the world. Amen.</HI> Therefore I am &s;low to believe, that any mini&s;ter that obtains grace to abide in the&s;e conditions, will &s;tarve in a land of plenty; altho' all civil powers is again&s;t him. And more e&s;pecially when I con&s;ider that God is uni|form in all his ways, and works, and &s;ends none a warfare without providing all things nece&s;&s;ary therefor, 1 Cor. 9.7. Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? 2 Tim. 2.4. Again, Luke 22. And he &s;aid unto them, when I &s;ent you without pur&s;e, and &s;crip, and &s;hoes, lacked ye any thing? and they &s;aid, nothing. Pray mind, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and forever. For he hath hitherto &s;up|ported his mini&s;ters from age to age, when all civil power was again&s;t them. Witne&s;s the apo&s;tolic age, and the reformation from popery, and the pre&s;ent day, in which civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers was, and is again&s;t Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters and cau&s;e: Yet Chri&s;t found out ways to carry his plan and de|&s;igns thro' even down to our day. Witne&s;s the de&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters at Old England; they have been comfortably &s;upported for more than one hundred years, without ci|vil power, collectors or pri&s;ons, having any
<PB N="140" REF="010621_0137_0F81BA271659B5D0">
concern therein. It mu&s;t be a &s;trange pa|radox indeed, to conclude that the religion of Chri&s;t &s;hould loo&s;e its proper vertue and nature of influencing and governing mens hearts, lives, and practice, only by pa&s;|&s;ing over from Old England, to new, and by that time it takes place in Connecticut, it is &s;o enfeebled, that it cannot produce the &s;ame effect upon the hearts and lives of Men, here, as there; but to make up the deficiency, there mu&s;t be added the power of the civil arm, the general a&s;&s;embly, &s;u|perior and county courts, ju&s;tices of the peace, collectors, and pri&s;ons, wa&s;ting of goods, and life at the end, for what the law has done to pre&s;erve it, all threatning the per&s;on that putteth not into the mini&s;ters mouths. Micah 3.5. And he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war again&s;t him. Ob&s;erve further. It can|not be di&s;tance of place that alters the re|ligion of Chri&s;t. See this &s;ide the briny ocean, the &s;ame effect is produced here as there. For more than one hundred years Bo&s;ton and Charle&s;town (the place of my nativity) have &s;upported their mini&s;ters by a free contribution; there is no civil pow|er exerci&s;ed in the affair; and one would think a hundred years experience in any
<PB N="141" REF="010621_0138_0F81BA27CBE97810">
practice, is long enough to know whether it will an&s;wer the end or not. But the truth is, it has been tryed as long as Chri&s;t has had a mini&s;try here upon earth, and has never failed. This day &s;till &s;peaks with a loud and &s;triking voice, the truth and co|venant faithfulne&s;s of the ever ble&s;&s;ed Son of God. Witne&s;s the &s;upport of my&s;elf and brethern in the mini&s;try in this refor|mation; for con&s;ider you that made the objection, how comes it to pa&s;s, that we lay-teachers have been &s;upported, &s;ome of us, near 20 years, and &s;ome of us con&s;ider|able families, and but low in the world, and but few that wait on our mini&s;try, in &s;ome places, in compari&s;on of the lawful a&s;&s;em|blies, and them few mo&s;tly low in the world, that do &s;carcely bring the year a|bout, as we u&s;ed to &s;ay; and be&s;ides all this di&s;advantage, our &s;ub&s;tance hal'd away from us, to &s;upport your mini&s;ters, by the civil power, (fal&s;ely &s;o called) and &s;old at the &s;ign-po&s;t, for a &s;ong, or trifle; great wa&s;te made at times of our &s;ub&s;tance; which we procured by the help of kind Pro|dence in hard labour; additional hereto, at times our bodies &s;eiz'd, and carried off to pri|&s;on, and our bu&s;ine&s;s left? The reader may ea&s;ily think how when the head of a fami|ly is thus confined, our friends are in tears,
<PB N="142" REF="010621_0139_0F81BA28DCB99F58">
at our being haled away in &s;uch a manner, and the poor collectors like Cain, with their countenances fallen, and full of wrath, or a palene&s;s and trembling &s;eizing them, like Bel&s;hazzar, when he &s;aw the hand-writing upon the wall. Now notwith&s;tanding all this, we are comfortably &s;upported thro' the abundant goodne&s;s, and pure mercy of our ever true and faithful Lord and Ma&s;ter, who makes out to a tittle, all his gracious engagements to his mini&s;ters, church and people. That you do not hear us mur|muring again&s;t our flocks crying, more &s;alary, more &s;alary! or we will leave you, &amp;c. No, this hath not as yet been the ca&s;e: but there is no thanks nor prai&s;e due to us, for we and our little flocks, are as liable to be entangled with human &s;chemes, worldly mindedne&s;s, di&s;tru&s;t of God and covetou&s;ne&s;s, as our neighbours; the diffe|rence lies not in us, but in our good, gra|cious and &s;overeign Lord, who&s;e free grace, wi&s;dom, and power, and righteous plan ef|fects the&s;e things in us, and for us; and all the prai&s;e is entirely and forever due to him alone. Therefore with liberty I would propound this que&s;tion to tho&s;e that may make the objection, viz. What is the rea|&s;on, that we get along under all the&s;e di&s;|advantages (being deluded as you &s;ay) and
<PB N="143" REF="010621_0140_0F81BA294EC111B0">
you being in the truth, under all the ad|vantages po&s;&s;ible almo&s;t, and your mini&s;ters &s;tarve without the civil law to &s;upport them? Pray, let this take your attention! and do not let it pa&s;s without a ju&s;t &s;olution. But perhaps &s;ome will think, that they have &s;olved the que&s;tion, viz. That it is the high fal&s;e zeal, that &s;eperates have, that makes them &s;o bountiful towards their mi|ni&s;ters in &s;upporting them? I an&s;wer, that this is quite unlikely, for this rea&s;on, they are equally inclined to love the world as their neighbours, and it is altogether un|likely, that, &s;uch a high fal&s;e zeal &s;hould la&s;t in &s;uch a &s;teady uninterrupted manner for 20 years; more &s;pecially when there is &s;o little zeal of late years among them, either good or bad. But if I may &s;hew my opinion in the ca&s;e, I rather think, that it is more from light and knowledge of the &s;cripture rule of &s;upporting the go&s;pel that they act then from high fal&s;e zeal. For having under&s;tood that the go&s;pel is &s;up|ported by the contributions of the people, they act, zeal or no zeal; yet doubtle&s;s &s;ometimes love to God and his cau&s;e, &s;en|&s;ibly governs in the hearts of the &s;aints; and then they find the word of God fulfil|ed in them, that it is more ble&s;&s;ed to give, than to receive, Acts 20, 35.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="010621_0141_0F81BA2A0E50A470">Secondly. If it be true, as the objection &s;aith that the&s;e mini&s;ters and churches would crumble down, the mini&s;ters have no &s;up|port, if the prop of the civil law was taken away, and they have no help from that quarter. Then I think it unavoidably fol|loweth, that the mini&s;ters and churches of this plan, are not formed nor made by Chri&s;t, but by and from men in their own inventions, for Chri&s;t's church and mini|&s;ters have liv'd from age to age, when all civil power was &s;et to de&s;troy them; wit|ne&s;s the fields of blood the church has waded through from time to time, which church hi&s;tory te&s;tifieth of. I think that church that cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without civil power to uphold it, has the &s;cripture mark of a fal&s;e or harlot church, Rev. 17, chap. 13. So on the contrary, that religion which is from Chri&s;t, implanted in the heart, has that governing and authority in its own nature, upon the &s;ubjects of it, that from divine love to the author of it, they freely move forward to do all that duty, made manife&s;t to the under&s;tanding; without fear of puni&s;hment either from God or man. Puni&s;hment as a ruling motive is out of the que&s;tion. The &s;aints of God do not attend duty for fear of hell, but pure, cha&s;te love governs in &s;ome degree in the
<PB N="145" REF="010621_0142_0F81BA2E7110EDA8">
heart, to do duty, &s;ee 1 John 5, 3. For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous. Here reader, (as delud|ed as you may think I am) I te&s;tify is the very e&s;&s;ence and &s;oul of true religion de&s;|cribed. The &s;ubjects of it &s;ee &s;uch wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s, power and purity, &s;hining forth in all God's commands, as ravi&s;hes the heart with &s;uch holy delight and complacency: &s;o that the per&s;ons li|berty, joy and happine&s;s lies in keeping the &s;ame. This, this religion wants no civil power under heaven to &s;upport it; but fal&s;e religion, or that which men's wi&s;dom has planned, cannot well &s;ub&s;i&s;t without civil power, to be its prop. Now if there be any truth in the objection, (as I am prone to think there is) then it followeth, that the religious con&s;titution of this colony is not of God, but has its original from mens wi&s;dom, and may be &s;een de&s;cribed in the word of God, by all that will not &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the light. I will point my rea|der to his character, &s;ee Ezek. 44, 6 to 10. and thou &s;halt &s;ay to the rebellious, &amp;c. Here God faults his church for bringing in|to his hou&s;e unconverted per&s;ons, through which means his holy things was polluted, and this is the &s;tate of poor Connecticut;
<PB N="146" REF="010621_0143_0F81BA2F35F42DF8">
they have let down their watch, in admit|ting members into their churches, almo&s;t any per&s;on, that has common grace to keep him from out-breaking &s;ins, may be ad|mitted into the churches of this con&s;titution, altho' their conver&s;ation di&s;covers reigning enmity in their heart again&s;t God and the influences of his Holy Spirit upon the hearts and lives of the godly. This is and &s;hould be for a lamentation; becau&s;e it opens the door wide for a revolt from God, and his rules and laws, which the text plain|ly &s;heweth. Our godly fore-fathers &s;aw this dreadful evil, and trembled with fear. See Mr. Mather, before cited, in the epi&s;tle page 8. "If we e&s;pou&s;e &s;uch principles as the&s;e, namely, that churches are not to en|quire into the regeneration of tho&s;e whom they admit into their communion, that ad|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;acraments is to be left wholly to the prudence and con&s;cience of the mi|ni&s;ter. &mdash; That explicit covenanting with God, and with the church is needle&s;s. That per&s;ons not qualified for communion, in &s;pecial ordinances, &s;hall elect pa&s;tors for churches. That all profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians have a right to bapti&s;m. That brethren are to have no voice in eccle&s;ia&s;tical councils. That the e&s;&s;ence of a mini&s;ter's call is not in the election of the people; but in the
<PB N="147" REF="010621_0144_0F81BA30DC787F78">
ceremony of impo&s;ing hands &amp;c. We then give away the whole congregational cau&s;e at once." Thus this godly man writes. But it would have &s;uited me much better, if he had &s;aid, we give up the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t in the affairs of his vi&s;ible kingdom, all at once&mdash;for I lay no &s;tre&s;s upon names of di&s;tinction. What I would is to be a true follower of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and let men call me as they like.</P>
<P>Now candid reader, &s;ee how exactly this pa&s;&s;age (which was Mr. Mather's fears) de&s;|cribes the &s;tanding and practice of the&s;e con&s;ociated churches, as exact as if he now lived and took the de&s;cription from the pre&s;ent practice of the&s;e churches. But this was printed ten years before Saybrook plan; and quite likely that Mr. Mather under&s;tood what the&s;e lordly mini&s;ters had got upon the wheel to bring about, which was the cau&s;e of his te&s;timony again&s;t it. And this further confirms me in my opini|on, that tho&s;e that compiled them articles of di&s;cipline in Saybrook plan, under&s;tood them&s;elves to mean as the articles &s;ay and as Mr. Hobart pleads. And that the ex|plainer of that plan quite mi&s;t the mind of tho&s;e that compo&s;ed and e&s;tabli&s;hed them. Here I think is &s;omething worthy of notice, that this learned, godly mini&s;ter law things
<PB N="148" REF="010621_0145_0F81BA3196432860">
as I now do, many years before I was born, for I never &s;aw his book until after I began this piece: and if he is deluded, &s;o am I: but if he was in the truth, &s;o &s;hall I be found in the truth, in the&s;e my ob&s;ervati|ons upon this plan. Further Mr. Mather writes, page 32. "An&s;wer 2, the practice of the churches in New-England, as to this particular, is lawful, laudable and edi|fying: it is lawful for churches to de&s;ire tho&s;e that offer them&s;elves to holy fellow|&s;hip, to give an account of their faith and repentance, and when a church de&s;ires it, no capable per&s;on ought to refu&s;e it; for, fir&s;t, there is a &s;cripture warrant for this practice," &amp;c. Now opening the church's doors to let in gracele&s;s per&s;ons, (which as I under&s;tand is the practice of all the churches in the con&s;titution) makes way for the other heavy &s;troke, as in the text la&s;t cited, ver. 8. And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things, but ye have &s;et keepers of my charge in my &s;anctuary, for your&s;elves. Ob&s;erve, when a church lets down their watch, and lets in unconverted per&s;ons into the church, then it is natural for &s;uch members to choo&s;e unconverted men for their mini&s;ters, to be over them, as the Lord complains in this text. And &s;o the old proverb is verified, Like people,
<PB N="149" REF="010621_0146_0F81BA3258ACDD30">
like prie&s;t; unconverted members, and un|converted mini&s;ters: which is doubtle&s;s the &s;hocking ca&s;e of the main of this colony and land. I actually fear that the church|es of this con&s;titution abound with uncon|verted members, and the land with un|converted mini&s;ters. A Heavy judgment of God upon the land! and that becau&s;e chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors have not kept the charge of God's holy things: not duly re&s;pecting the rules Chri&s;t has given his church to walk by, in admitting her members and mini&s;ters. Therefore, I firmly believe, that the&s;e &s;criptures following are rightly applied to this generation. Micah 7.4. The day of thy watchmen, and thy vi&s;itati|on cometh, now &s;hall be their perplexity. Zech. 11.3, 4.5. There is a voice of the howling of the &s;hepherds, for their glory is &s;poiled. Thus &s;aith the Lord my God, feed the flock of the &s;laughter; who&s;e po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors &s;lay them, and hold them&s;elves not guilty, and they that fell them &s;ay, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, for I am rich: and their own &s;hepherds pity them not, Micah 3.5.6, 11. And he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war again&s;t him. Therefore night &s;hall be unto you, that ye &s;hall not have a vi&s;ion, and it &s;hall be dark unto you, that ye &s;hall not divine,
<PB N="150" REF="010621_0147_0F81BA3318EBBED8">
and the &s;un &s;hall go down over the prophets' and the day &s;hall be dark over them. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 3.12, 14. <HI>O my people, they which lead thee, cau&s;e thee to err, and de&s;troy the way of thy paths. For ye have eaten up the vineyard; the &s;poil of the poor is in your hou&s;es.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Likely &s;ome of my readers will &s;ay, that I am a very cen&s;orious per&s;on to charge the church members and their mini&s;ters, with being unconverted. An&s;wer. I am wil|ling to put my credit upon a fair go&s;pel trial.&mdash;Chri&s;t &s;aith a tree is known by its fruit. Let them that experimentally know Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his &s;pirits work and ope|ration upon mens hearts make the trial; carefully examining church members, member by member, and mini&s;ter by mi|ni&s;ter, to &s;ee what they knew of a work of grace, or the &s;anctifying operations of God's &s;pirit. And I firmly believe my credit will &s;tand good with all &s;uch as know the go&s;pel fruits of true chri&s;tianity; and as for the re&s;t, I expect to lie under their cen&s;or. But they will do well to take good heed le&s;t they be found at la&s;t to be the per&s;ons, that they charge me to be, and I innocent of the charge. But this I will venture to affirm, that upwards of fifteen years ago, the holy &s;pirit of God led me to &s;ee the &s;tanding of the churches of this con|&s;titution,
<PB N="151" REF="010621_0148_0F81BA33CAE2D998" MS="y">
in the 44th of Ezek. before men|tioned, and equally true it is, that their character is drawn in I&s;aiah 29, 13. Where|fore the Lord &s;aid, for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me; but have re|moved their heart far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of men. This pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred writ perfect|ly agrees with the objection, which &s;aith, if the churches and mini&s;ters have not &s;up|port by civil rulers, they will all crumble down, and &s;o &s;aith this text, viz. That there is no more of God among them, than God's precepts make. Here is a perfect gla&s;s, that all my dear neighbours, and friends, that hold the con&s;titution, may &s;ee their face in. For take away mens precepts and your religion is all up, by your own opinion, &s;o that here I &s;hall &s;lip out of the que&s;tion, and clo&s;e my an&s;wer to this ob|jection, for you and the &s;criptures have &s;et|tled the point, and both agree that there is no more religion in this con&s;titution, than what is made by men, and that is poor enough.</P>
<P>Objection 3. I am quite di&s;&s;atisfied with your writing, for it appears plain that your whole aim is to &s;trike up the whole of our religious con&s;titution, root and branch, and

<P>An&s;wer. I freely confe&s;s my de&s;ign is, the Lord willing, graciou&s;ly to help me, to hold this religious con&s;titution forth in its own nature, in the light of the &s;criptures, that is may be &s;een to be what it is, for I firmly believe, that all per&s;ons who &s;ee it in &s;cripture light, will hold up both hands (if need be) for its final overthrow. Sure I am, that it is the duty of all that &s;ee and know that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is anointed king in Zion, the rightful Lord of con&s;cience, to improve all their knowledge, grace and gifts for its overthrow, and if Divine Light and truth proves its overthrow, no-body ought to be offended thereat; and if &s;crip|ture and right rea&s;on, be admitted into the mind, with its own weight and force, and it does not prove its final ruin, then I &s;ay let it live and pro&s;per. But then I mu&s;t beg liberty to deny the con&s;equence drawn in the objection, that it will undoe the colony, to fling up the con&s;titution. I am obliged,
<PB N="153" REF="010621_0150_0F81BA354C5FA5F8">
as I under&s;tand the &s;criptures, and the na|ture of things, to think quite the rever&s;e; that in fact the colony will be ruined, and an undone people, if it is not flung up, and every man left, to choo&s;e articles of faith, mini&s;ter, and place of divine wor&s;hip for him&s;elf, and not be controuled by civil powers. We do well to weigh this point thoroughly; and in order to it, it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h between the civil and divine kingdom. Not rightly di|viding here is the cau&s;e of the greate&s;t dif|ficulty, now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting about religion. Ob|&s;erve, civil rulers as they an&s;wer the cha|racter given them in the word of God, as his mini&s;ters for the people's good. Rom. 3. 1 to 5. I under&s;tand the whole of their work, is as followeth, 1. Under God, (and as &s;et by him for that end) to pre&s;erve life. 2. Property. 3. Liberty. Life when it is expo&s;ed by the de&s;igns of wicked men, or otherwi&s;e, the rulers aid is wanted; pro|perty, by the execution of whole&s;ome and righteous laws to pre&s;erve every one in their ju&s;t, legal rights and properties. Liberty by defending every one of different &s;ects, in their &s;acred rights of con&s;cience, not allowing one &s;ect to di&s;turb another, while they are peaceably &amp; publickly wor&s;hipping God, as they think is be&s;t plea&s;ing in his gracious
<PB N="154" REF="010621_0151_0F81BA38CFB11ED0">
&s;ight. Here I under&s;tand is the extent of rulers work. It does not belong to them to &s;ay, who is qualified for church-mem|ber&s;hip, or not; who &s;hall be a church, or who not; nor to &s;ay where per&s;ons &s;hall wor&s;hip, and where not; or what lines &s;hall be the limits of a church, or who is quali|fied to choo&s;e a mini&s;ter, and who not; or who &s;hall preach, &amp; be a mini&s;ter and who not. To &s;um up all, they have nothing to do (as civil rulers) with any thing that re&s;pects the religious wor&s;hip that God requires of his church and people. This I have &s;hewn in the beginning of my di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus dividing between the civil and di|vine kingdom, let us con&s;ider what hurt is done to any man's civil intere&s;t, by different &s;ects wor&s;hipping God in different places in the &s;ame town. Society lines mu&s;t be denied, till civil rulers &s;hew their warrant from the word of God, to make them; and all civil bu|&s;ine&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to be done, may be done in the town limits, and what is otherwi&s;e, be|longs to every religious community to &s;ay. This is not a new &s;tarted principle of mine; &s;ee Saybrook confe&s;&s;ion, page 101, head 5. "Tho' parochial bounds be not of divine right, yet for common edification, the mem|bers of a particular church ought, as much as conveniently may be, to live near one
<PB N="155" REF="010621_0152_0F81BA39A9A95820">
another." The reader &s;hould keep in mind how common a thing it is for this plan to contradict it&s;elf: the laws have fixed pa|ri&s;h lines, and every per&s;on mu&s;t be &s;ub|jected to them bounds, altho' their teacher be as Chri&s;t &s;aith, a thief and a robber, John 10, 1. Or let con&s;cience &s;ay what it will about the wor&s;hip&mdash;To return to the point, there can no hurt come to any man's civil or natural right, by different &s;ects, be|ing allowed, and pre&s;erved in the privi|lege of wor&s;hipping God, as each party thinks mo&s;t agreable to God's word. Since I have liv'd in Middletown, there has been 5 different wor&s;hips in the town, with|in the compa&s;s of a mile on the Lord's day, be&s;ides the con&s;titution, and church of Eng|land, and &s;eparates, there was a number of Dutch, in one private hou&s;e, and the neutral French, in another, and no damage accrued to any man's property, or civil in|tere&s;t, any more than if they had all wor|&s;hipped under one roof; and had there been added, Bapti&s;ts, Quakers, and Moravians, it makes no odds, as to mens civil pro|perty. If any per&s;on of either of the&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ions breaks the civil law, he lies open to puni&s;hment, equally &s;o, as if there was but one profe&s;&s;ion in the town. I think it will not weaken the hands of civil rulers,
<PB N="156" REF="010621_0153_0F81BA39F7738E80">
that rule for God, to have different profe&s;|&s;ions in a town or colony. For con&s;ider per&s;ons in different profe&s;&s;ions, finding them&s;elves favoured with an equal &s;hare of liberty, with the re&s;t of their neighbours, and fellow &s;ubjects, it will in my opinion have a natural tendency to knit their af|fections, and dutiful regard to their rulers, &s;tronger, if it can be, than if they was all of one opinion in religion. The contrary is al&s;o evident, that when per&s;ons know that the Mo&s;t High, is the alone ab&s;olute Lord of con&s;cience; and that no mortal breathing has any right to hinder them from thinking and acting for them&s;elves, in re|ligious affairs; and now for civil rulers to &s;et up and e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ect that plea&s;es them, and deprive all the re&s;t of their e|qual &s;hare of liberty, and force their neigh|bours to go again&s;t the light of their con|&s;ciences, or &s;uffer fines and impri&s;onments, or great wa&s;te of goods, &amp;c. Sure I am, that nothing is more likely to alienate good &s;ubjects from due affection, and dutiful re|gard to their civil rulers, than &s;uch a prac|tice; for the be&s;t of men have the remains of corruption in them, and when they are thus unju&s;tly treated, they need the &s;trong hand of &s;anctifying grace, to keep them at the feet of their oppre&s;&s;ors and per&s;ecutors.
<PB N="157" REF="010621_0154_0F81BA3ABA8B1368">
The law of nature, rea&s;on and grace, will lay &s;ubjects under &s;trong obligations to their rulers, when equal ju&s;tice is mini&s;tred to them of different principles, in the prac|tice of religion: they will all as one unite, and offer all dutiful &s;ubjection, and aid to their rulers, to help them thro' their work, in the admini&s;tring equal ju&s;tice for the good of the whole. But as things now are, po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome of as good &s;ubjects, as is in the colony, are obliged from a due regard to the Lord Je&s;us, to refu&s;e &s;ubjec|tion, and obedience to the civil rulers com|mands, when they are putting into execu|tion their eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, and not from any di&s;like to their per&s;ons neither. Who|ever are acquainted with church hi&s;tory, know that the e&s;tabli&s;hing religious con|&s;titutions, and compelling others that dif|fer therefrom, to &s;ubject thereto, has been the bone of contention through Chri&s;ten|dom, from age to age, and the unhappy cau&s;e of rivers of blood being &s;hed, to main|tain their con&s;titutions. I will venture to affirm, that no religious con&s;titution, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by a civil law, in a kingdom, or colony, where God works by his word preached, through the &s;pirits aid, can be pre&s;erved, without they per&s;ecute more or le&s;s. Probably all that e&s;teem the con&s;ti|tution
<PB N="158" REF="010621_0155_0F81BA3B5DE146D8">
of this colony, look upon it the be&s;t that they know of, in all the reformed na|tions: yet it bringeth forth this bitter fruit of per&s;ecution, and oppre&s;&s;ion, more than the national e&s;tabli&s;hment. I pre&s;ume, that thro' Great Britain, or the whole nation, there cannot be found that done by civil law again&s;t the glorious work of God's &s;pi|rit, that has been poured out of late years, as has been done in this colony. But this is certain, that the church of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as &s;uch, never per&s;ecutes, nor does the &s;crip|tures ever &s;hew that they never put any to pri&s;on, for the &s;ake of religion, or for con|&s;cienciou&s;ly di&s;charging religious duty. But the fal&s;e, antichri&s;tian church has from age to age, and &s;o has this of this con&s;titution, impri&s;oned the &s;aints for nothing el&s;e but their attending chri&s;tian duties plainly com|manded by the great God; the duty of exhortation, and of expounding the &s;crip|tures, and preaching the go&s;pel, and wor|&s;hipping God according to their con&s;cien|ces. Therefore it remains for you who have thus acted, to get under that cha|racter, given you in Rev. 2.10. Behold the devil &s;hall ca&s;t &s;ome of you into pri&s;on; meaning tho&s;e per&s;ons that are under the devil's influence, of pride, malice, and &s;u|per&s;tition, and per&s;ecution, &s;hall ca&s;t the
<PB N="159" REF="010621_0156_0F81BA3C2D7E54F0">
&s;aints, &amp;c. Wherefore it appears to me, that in&s;tead of the colony's being ruined by enacting full and free liberty of con&s;cience, it is the mo&s;t likely, if not the only remedy to &s;ave it from confu&s;ion, and final ruin: for &s;uch a liberty has a natural tendency to unite all parties in good neighbourhood, to &s;trive together in all civil things for the good of the whole civil body, and the con|trary for its ruin. But the Saybrook plan a&s;&s;erts, that there is no warrant for the ma|gi&s;trate to abridge &s;ober con&s;cientious profe&s;|&s;ors from their liberty of wor&s;hipping God as they &s;hall think fit, &s;ee page 74. Yet their eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, confronts their ar|ticles; and no marvel, that when a plan contradicts God's word, that it &s;hould fre|quently contradict it&s;elf, &amp;c. That there is no foundation to e&s;tabli&s;h a religious con|&s;titution, by force of civil laws, I think is evident by what followeth, fir&s;t con&s;ider who, or what profe&s;&s;ion &s;hall have this e&s;|tabli&s;hment? you will &s;ay tho&s;e that are orthodox, and &s;ound in the faith. But that is to &s;ay nothing to the ca&s;e, becau&s;e every one is &s;o to him&s;elf, &amp; doubtle&s;s thinks he is in the right way to heaven, altho' in fact, he may be in the way to hell. Witne&s;s the papi&s;ts, they think that they are in the very apo&s;to|lick order, therefore force all to comply
<PB N="160" REF="010621_0157_0F81BA3D3B290CD0">
with their religious con&s;titution, that they may be &s;aved. But you may further &s;ay, tho&s;e that are truly &s;anctified and holy in heart, and take the &s;criptures for their only rule of faith and practice. An&s;wer. How &s;hall civil rulers, as &s;uch, know &s;uch a people, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h them? do you not deny the knowledge of the &s;aints? But granting that they be known by their fruits. Yet I dare affirm, &s;uch a people would utterly refu&s;e &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment, and for the&s;e rea&s;ons, fir&s;t, in that they that are holy in heart, know that all grace, light, know|ledge, faith and holine&s;s, is entirely the free gift of God, out of the power of any mortal to convey, and that they them&s;elves are poor &s;inful beggars, that daily want more grace for them&s;elves; &s;o that they neither &s;et up them&s;elves in high dignity, above their neighbours, nor want to be inve&s;ted with any power for that end; but only &s;ay to their fellow profe&s;&s;ors and neighbours as in Mat. 25.9. But go ye rather to them that &s;ell, and buy for your&s;elves. Note here, they are pointed to the &s;ame fountain of all grace, and there left to &s;tand or fall, accept or reject, &amp;c. Secondly, the&s;e per|&s;ons &s;eeing that the written word of God is the alone rule of faith and practice, in all their obedience, and divine love to the au|thor
<PB N="161" REF="010621_0158_0F81BA3D903FC270">
of that rule, is the &s;oul &s;pring to move a per&s;on forward to obey what that rule injoins. So that they dete&s;t and abhor the notion of civil powers being concerned in all the affair. Further they know, that the utmo&s;t that civil power can do, in &s;uch affairs, is but to make men mi&s;erable hypocrites; for they cannot make one true follower of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with all their force. Indeed I mu&s;t confe&s;s it is beyond me to account for (any man of good &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, that is experimentally acquainted with true re|ligion) pretending to plead up for a reli|gious con&s;titution, to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by ci|vil powers; for in truth there is nothing for civil rulers to do in the whole affair. It is agreed on by all, that there is a per|fect rule already given in the &s;criptures, for faith and practice; and we look for no addition or &s;upplement thereto. And it is equally granted, that civil rulers cannot make any man believe in Chri&s;t, nor love or obey him in the lea&s;t of his commands. Therefore in meekne&s;s, I a&s;k the zealous advocates for this con&s;titution, what is the work that God a&s;&s;igns to rulers to do in a religious con&s;titution? And what part of &s;acred writ &s;hall I find their directions giv|en them? You will likely &s;ay in the old te&s;tament, in the books of Mo&s;es, for he
<PB N="162" REF="010621_0159_0F81BA3E695563F0">
was a civil ruler, and he ordered the affairs of the church and wor&s;hip of God. An|&s;wer. When our civil rulers can &s;hew that they depend upon and go to God as Mo&s;es did, for their direction. See Num. 9.8.9. And Mo&s;es &s;aid unto then, Sand &s;till, and I will hear what the Lord will com|mand concerning you. And the Lord &s;pake unto Mo&s;es, &s;aying, &amp;c. Ob&s;erve, here was a matter of difficulty re&s;pecting &s;ome that was defiled by a dead body: Mo&s;es nor the Levites does not pre&s;cribe in this ca&s;e, but God alone: So that I would charitably hope, that the advocates for this plan won't &s;ay, that our rulers when they enacted the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, &s;tood thus before God as Mo&s;es did, to have God immediately by a voice tell them, that this act &s;hall be &s;o, and that &s;o; or that every man that had fifty &s;hillings or forty pounds in the li&s;t, &s;hould be as good vo|ters for to choo&s;e a mini&s;ter, as the mo&s;t godly, &amp;c. Nor yet that they was imme|diately in&s;pired by the Holy Spirit to plan them laws: So that unle&s;s this is made out of our rulers, the objection mu&s;t fall; but the truth is, that under the Mo&s;aick di&s;|pen&s;ation, there was no king or law-giver to I&s;rael or the church, but God him&s;elf, until Saul was given; at which time I&s;rael
<PB N="163" REF="010621_0160_0F81BA3F0F9165B8">
had their minds alienated from God, and did not like that he &s;hould be their alone king; but they cho&s;e to have &s;ome imper|fect man &s;et over them to be their king, like other nations. Yet it is plain, that in the days of Mo&s;es, he acted nothing from him&s;elf, but God alone was the &s;ole legi&s;|lature; he gave out the laws civil and ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical. Therefore it was, that in that di&s;pen&s;ation they &s;tood &s;o together, or that Mo&s;es gave the laws of both tables. And if our civil rulers had the like direction from God him&s;elf, we might &s;afe enough &s;ubmit to their pre&s;criptions in religious affairs; but till this is made out, we have no warrant to regard them in any of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical pre&s;criptions.</P>
<P>Again, I think it will bare to &s;ay, that no man that holds liberty of con&s;cience, can admit of a religious e&s;tabli&s;hment by civil powers, and be con&s;i&s;tent with him|&s;elf. This will appear very evident in the following metaphor, as thus,&mdash;&s;uppo&s;ing Peter has the right to make the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment as be&s;t &s;uits him. By the way ob|&s;erve, that an e&s;tabli&s;hment is nothing, if it has not compul&s;ive power to have all in its limits, &s;ubject to this plan; and if &s;o, where then is John's right of private judg|ment, or James's liberty of con&s;cience? I
<PB N="164" REF="010621_0161_0F81BA3FD7DFD100">
think it is all &s;truck up, at the &s;uppo&s;ition of Peter's right to make an e&s;tabli&s;hment John and James's liberty is re&s;olved into Peter's will; and what if Peter will not to|lerate John and James? for mind it is granted, that Peter has a right, &amp;c. Here then it is plain that John and James are fi|nally deprived of their right, &amp;c. I earne&s;t|ly want, de&s;ire and pray, that my hone&s;t neighbours might rightly under&s;tand them|&s;elves, when they &s;ay, <HI>Liberty of con&s;cience in Connecticut,</HI> and at the &s;ame time &s;ay al|&s;o, <HI>We have got a good religious con&s;titution.</HI> I dare bid the challenge to all mortals breath|ing, to extricate and deliver John and James out of their difficulties, while Peter maintains his right of e&s;tabli&s;hment. In this figure is the true &s;tate of this colony. The cry is, that their is liberty of con&s;ci|ence here; but it is not true, for the &s;epe|rates have gone to the general a&s;&s;embly, with their prayers, from year to year, a&s;k|ing nothing but their ju&s;t right, full and free liberty of con&s;cience, and have been, and are &s;till denied their reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Again, the objection &s;aith, the fault is not in the con&s;titution, but the want of more toleration. Let us con&s;ider this in the former figure. The objector &s;uppo&s;es, that Peter ought to tolerate John and James,
<PB N="165" REF="010621_0162_0F81BA4090ECC768">
becau&s;e they appear to be hone&s;t well mean|ing per&s;ons, and altho' they have made a mi&s;take in religion, yet it is hopeful they may be Chri&s;tians;&mdash;they do not di&s;turbe their neighbours that differ from them in religion, and they are as loyal &s;ubjects in ci|vil kingdom, as their neighbours: therefore they ought to have liberty of con&s;cience, and not be compelled to wor&s;hip, or &s;upport a wor&s;hip contrary to their &s;olid judgment. Thus far &s;ome will &s;ay, that are zealous for the con&s;titution, and little think that they have in effect de&s;troyed their good con&s;ti|tution. For con&s;ider, if it be rea&s;onable and right that John and James, &s;hould have liberty, then it mu&s;t be equally right that Mark and Luke, being in the like ca&s;e as John, &s;hould have equal liberty. Al&s;o, Job and David, being well acquainted with the &s;criptures, and look upon Peter's plan contrary thereto, and &s;o dare not for a world comply therewith, by rea&s;on of an infinite &s;uperior power, requiring their obe|dience otherwi&s;e. Therefore they challeng|ing as their ju&s;t right, the like liberty that John and the re&s;t have got. Now reader, you may ea&s;ily &s;ee what will become of Pe|ter's good con&s;titution, by and by in this practice, which is, and mu&s;t be acknow|ledged to be right, by all that hold liberty
<PB N="166" REF="010621_0163_0F81BA4151EF7228">
of con&s;cience; for there is the &s;ame parity of rea&s;on, that a hundred religious commu|nities &s;hould be relea&s;ed as to relea&s;e one. But the truth of all is, that allowing liber|ty of con&s;cience the right of thinking and acting for one's &s;elf, in religious matters, to be true doctrine according to the word of God (which doctrine has always been ac|knowledged to be &s;ound and good by all true prote&s;tants and chri&s;tians) then I think it unavoidably &s;trikes up all religious con|&s;titutions (e&s;tabli&s;hed by civil power) under heaven. For right rea&s;on dictates, that if John had a right to think and act for him|&s;elf in religious matters, it is impo&s;&s;ible for Peter to have any right to hinder him: o|therwi&s;e we &s;hall make perfect wi&s;dom the author of confu&s;&s;ion. Again, in other words, if it be the mind of God revealed in his word, that John &s;hall chu&s;e articles of faith and practice for him&s;elf, and a church and mini&s;ter that he believes to be of God; then it followeth that no powers what&s;oever has any right to hinder, or prevent him from enjoying what God has enjoined upon him and commanded. This all mu&s;t grant, that no man or men may alter what the Almighty has granted or decreed; and he has decreed that every one &s;hall &s;tand or fall to his own ma&s;ter, is plain in the &s;criptures, and
<PB N="167" REF="010621_0164_0F81BA420AD6CF90">
in this re&s;pect no man has a right to judge another man's &s;ervant, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Again, The objection &s;aith, that if the con&s;titution be flung up, all manner of wickedne&s;s and profanene&s;s will prevail, and we &s;hall be as bad as they be at New-York or Rhode-I&s;land, &amp;c. I reply, it is a &s;andy foundation indeed, to &s;et up a con&s;ti|tution upon a bare con&s;equence. The thing to be &s;ettled, is not what will be, but what is; which is to &s;ay, Is the con&s;tituti|on right, or is it wrong? This &s;hould im|prove the attention of all; for it is a matter of the greate&s;t importance, to know. I think that I have &s;ufficiently &s;hewn, from &s;cripture and rea&s;on, that it is altogether wrong, contrary to the word of God; there|fore it ought to be rejected, let the con&s;e|quence be what it will. But let us con&s;i|der the matter carefully, paredventure there is a mi&s;take made about the con&s;equence, for if this religious con&s;titution has &s;uch vertue and power in it, to pre&s;erve from all manner of wickedne&s;s and profanene&s;s, how comes it to pa&s;s, that all manner of wicked|ne&s;s, has &s;o much prevailed in this colony, &s;ince it was &s;et up? Let the aged, greyhead|ed fathers, look back and con&s;ider, how the times was, before this con&s;titution was e&s;|tabli&s;hed by law, as to profane &s;wearing,
<PB N="168" REF="010621_0165_0F81BA433303CC98">
the &s;in of uncleanne&s;s, and neglect of fami|ly government; al&s;o the &s;in of oppre&s;&s;ion, brother going to law with brother, drunk|enne&s;s and &s;abbath breaking, pride and haughtine&s;s; and then turn his thoughts, and &s;ee how the times are now, as to the&s;e &s;inful practices. And I dare &s;ay they mu&s;t know that the times are va&s;tly wor&s;e now. That the con&s;titution in all its glory and power, does not prevent the&s;e growing evils; &s;o that the objection mu&s;t be fruit|le&s;s. Indeed it is my &s;olid opinion of the con&s;titution, that it has opened the door for the growth of all the wickedne&s;s that now prevails in the land. My rea&s;ons are as followeth, fir&s;t, for admitting in uncon|verted per&s;ons into the churches. Se|condly, making money an e&s;&s;ential qua|lification to vote for mini&s;ters. Third|ly, the&s;e di&s;qualified per&s;ons, voting in|to the mini&s;try unconverted men. 4. The eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, a&s;&s;uming that authority and rule that belongs to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and exerci&s;ed in his church. 5. The body of the colony combining together, to de&s;pi&s;e and reject the holy &s;pirit of God, as it o|perates upon the hearts of the children of men. 6. Civil rulers and officers under them, criminally neglecting to put into execution, tho&s;e civil laws of the
<PB N="169" REF="010621_0166_0F81BA43A1A22F08">
colony, that are good and whole&s;ome; &s;uit|ed to &s;uppre&s;s the growth of the many wick|ed practices now prevailing among&s;t us &amp;c. The&s;e things being the natural fruits that the con&s;titution bears, is the cau&s;e of the many evils prevailing in the land. Again, Chri&s;t &s;aith Matt. 12.33. Either make the tree good, and his fruit good, or el&s;e make the tree corrupt, and his fruit cor|rupt, for the tree is known by its fruit. Now if this con&s;titution be a good tree, how comes it to pa&s;s, that it brings forth &s;o much corrupt fruit &s;ince it has been plan|ted in this colony? what wickedne&s;s is there now prevailing in the colony! how much profane &s;wearing, not only among the &s;eafaring tribe, but town dwellers, and children, and &s;ervants, black and white, u&s;ing &s;uch language enough to make one's fle&s;h crawl, which I have often heard with my own ears; And how does the &s;in of drunkene&s;s prevail? men wa&s;ting their e&s;tates and lives with &s;trong liquor! and the &s;hameful and dreadful &s;in of uncleanne&s;s among our precious youth, and what re|velings and carou&s;ing, &s;inging and danc|ing at the &s;ound of the viol is the youth in|dulged in, both by parents, mini&s;ters and rulers, a practice that the devil glories in, through which he debauches hundreds, &amp;

de&s;troys thou&s;ands, but glo&s;&s;es it over with the name of civil recreation; but in truth is right down enmity to God, and leads down to eternal damnation. Again, if this con&s;titu|tion is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve from &s;in, why are the &s;ubjects of it, &s;o carnal &amp; worldly up|on the Lord's day? I have been informed from time to time, &s;ince I left that wor&s;hip, that in &s;ome places it is common for the youth, and &s;ome heads of families too, to get together on &s;abbath day noons, and talk about the world and &s;ecular things, and a|bout this and that news, and to be very light and carnal in going to, and coming from publick wor&s;hip, and young people getting together in companies in the &s;treet, full of vanity on &s;abbath evenings, and the body of the people attending &s;ecular bu&s;i|ne&s;s after &s;un&s;et; I &s;uppo&s;e it is not com|mon for people to tackle up their teams a &s;abbath evenings, yet as I was in Providence, called to pa&s;s the highway la&s;t &s;abbath e|vening, I pa&s;&s;ed by a man with his team with a load of apples, I &s;uppo&s;ed a going to the cider-mill, and people at work at the cider-mill, all which is contrary to the good and whole&s;ome laws of this colony, &amp; I think contrary to the laws of God. But where is the authority and under officers in &s;uch towns, that have held up their hands

I think the day is it hand, when they will &s;tand &s;peechle&s;s before their Judge, unle&s;s they &s;peedily wake up and repent of their &s;inful neglect of duty; and hence forth at|tend to their great duty, as God's mini&s;ters to be a terror to evil doers.</P>
<P>Again. If the con&s;titution is &s;uited to pre&s;erve mankind from wickedne&s;s, whence is it, that the &s;ubjects of it, are &s;o much puffed up with pride, haughtine&s;s, and vain glory, unmerciful to each other, con&s;tantly hara&s;&s;ing each other in the civil law, wa&s;t|ing goods at the &s;ign-po&s;t, brother taking brother by the throat, (as it were) as Chri&s;t calls it, and thru&s;ting one another into pri|&s;on? I might add, the party envy, and ha|tered among church members, and in neigh|bourhoods, and upon &s;ome occa&s;ions like a &s;preading lepro&s;y, &s;preading through a &s;ociety, when &s;ome things are tran&s;acted that effects mens pride and will; &s;uch as &s;etting a &s;take to fix the &s;pot for a meeting hou&s;e, or in &s;eating a meeting-hou&s;e, both which has flung &s;ocieties into contention and confu&s;ion; notwith&s;tanding their good con&s;titution, which they have to regulate them. Thus I think it is evident, that it does not reach the end propo&s;ed by it.&mdash;So
<PB N="172" REF="010621_0169_0F81BA47637D3480">
a fruitle&s;s thing. Now reader con&s;ider, what propriety is there in the objection? the&s;e evils are brought forth while the con|&s;titution is in its greate&s;t glory. And we poor &s;eperates that have renounced it, and have nothing to do with it, nor to glory in, but our infirmities are pre&s;erved, from the mo&s;t of the&s;e evils but no thanks is due to us, but all to free grace, and the plan of God's word, which we endeavour to walk by, and not the plan of this colony. Again. As to the profane &s;wearing, and &s;ab|bath-breaking, that is at New-York and Rhode-I&s;land. It is not owing to the want of a religious con&s;titution that &s;uch evils prevail in the&s;e governments. For accord|ing to my ob&s;ervation, the Ea&s;t end of Long I&s;land, are as civil, kind, courteous and re|ligious people as any in this colony, and where there is one &s;uit at law in their courts, I believe there is fifty at ours. They have no religious con&s;titution there e&s;tabli&s;hed by civil law; but every one is at liberty to act in religion as they think is mo&s;t plea|&s;ing to their Maker and Redeemer; and that is right, for &s;o it ought to be through Chri&s;tendom. But the cau&s;e of the&s;e evils prevailing in the&s;e governments, is the cri|minal neglect of civil rulers, in putting their whole&s;ome laws into execution; or
<PB N="173" REF="010621_0170_0F81BA4833C84190">
perhaps unqualified men put into authori|ty, may be no &s;mall cau&s;e of the&s;e evils pre|vailing. But did civil rulers in any govern|ment or colony &s;tand in the place where God has called them to &s;tand, they would &s;oon have God's ble&s;&s;ing upon their faith|ful admini&s;tring equal ju&s;tice to mankind, and &s;o become a terror to evil-doers, and a prai&s;e to tho&s;e that do well. Which great ble&s;&s;ing may the God of &s;trict ju&s;tice, and great mercy, &s;peedily &s;end, le&s;t the land is wa&s;ted with their own wickedne&s;s; for it appears to me, that there is no need of a &s;tamp-act to wa&s;te us; our own prac|tice, which the land is now in, will do it: their manner of living above them&s;elves&mdash; their making ha&s;te to be rich, and to effect it, undertaking bu&s;ine&s;s that they are not called to; their tru&s;ting in trade, and &s;uing each other, and underhand dealings, men not regarding their words, and &s;uch like. The effects hereof will crumble and wa&s;te the land, without any very &s;ingular vi&s;itation, unle&s;s there is a reformation in the&s;e affairs. And it is my humble opinion, that it would contribute much more to the peace, com|fort and pro&s;perity of this colony, and to the due honour of our civil rulers, if they would fling up concerning them&s;elves (as civil ru|lers) with eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, what re&s;pects

Here they may work for their great Lord and ma&s;ter, get due honor to them&s;elves, and be a great ble&s;&s;ing to the colony.

<P>Objection 4. You have made a great complaint and out-cry again&s;t our religious con&s;titution, &s;aying it deprives you of liber|ty of con&s;cience, and at the &s;ame time will not allow us liberty of con&s;cience, for we believe the con&s;titution is according to the

word of God, and we are bound in con&s;ci|ence to maintain it, but you in your zeal are labouring to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. This objection has a plau&s;ible &s;hew with it, as tho' I was incon&s;i&s;tent with my&s;elf, and has been the means of ca&s;ting dirt in the eyes of many &s;eperates in the ea&s;|tern parts of the colony. Poor hearts, that are &s;o ea&s;ily beguiled (by the cunning craft of men) of their ju&s;t right, and forgot Chri&s;t's caution in Rev. iii. 11. Behold I come quickly: hold that fa&s;t which thou ha&s;t, that no man take thy crown, Ob|&s;erve! the&s;e per&s;ons have known that the con&s;titution comes right a cro&s;s their &s;acred rights and privileges; &s;o that it is morally impo&s;ible for them in the mo&s;t milde&s;t man|ner, to a&s;k their right without &s;triking the con&s;titution; altho' they &s;hould not &s;ay one word in their prayer to the a&s;&s;embly to put down the con&s;titution, yet that which cro&s;|&s;es their right, in its own nature, mu&s;t be broke in upon, to give them their right. But to come to the matter in hand. There is no more propriety in the objection, than there would be for an Arian to complain again&s;t a faithful mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, that he denied him his liberty of con&s;cience, be|cau&s;e in his doctrine he proved from the &s;criptures, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was equal God
<PB N="176" REF="010621_0173_0F81BA4A52EC8B20">
with the Father, of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, co-equal, &amp;c. or there would be as much rea|&s;on for a man that intends to go to heaven, by his legal righteou&s;ne&s;s, to tell a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, that he denies him liberty of con|&s;cience, becau&s;e he in the right di&s;charge of his duty in preaching, makes it out from &s;cripture, that the poor deluded man, upon that bottom, is a going down to hell. Rom. 3.20. Therefore by the deeds of the law, there &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified in his &s;ight. Gal. 3.10. Now con&s;ider, what have I done to deprive my neighbour of the li|berty of his con&s;cience, any otherwi&s;e than &s;hewing from the &s;criptures, the iniquity and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of the con&s;titution, that it is planned counter to the word of God, and my unalienable right. So that if I have cro&s;&s;ed my neighbour's con&s;cience, it mu&s;t be an erroneous one, and not a good con&s;ci|ence. The objector little thinks how much he betrays him&s;elf, to be in the &s;pirit of Saul. Acts 9.1. And Saul yet breathing out &amp;c. Chapt. 26.9. I verily thought with my&s;elf that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Je&s;us. Indeed &s;uch a con|&s;cience as Saul had, (the truth I have thro' grace held forth) has hurt and gall'd. I think there is too much papi&s;h blood running in the veins of tho&s;e that make the objection;
<PB N="177" REF="010621_0174_0F81BA4B56F12370">
to e&s;tabli&s;h their religious con&s;titution, are obliged to de&s;troy, or deprive their neigh|bour of his ju&s;t right, and to u&s;urp that power that belongs to Chri&s;t alone; el&s;e they complain that they have not liberty of con&s;cience. I think that this is the very ca&s;e of tho&s;e that make the objection; for the &s;um total of what I would, or have done, in this performance, is only to open the gap for the children of men, to have full and free liberty of con&s;cience, to wor|&s;hip God and practice in religion, as they think is agreable to his holy word; and to grant this will in its own nature de&s;troy this celebrated con&s;titution; and I doubt not but &s;ome per&s;ons &s;ee it mu&s;t be &s;o, that have re&s;pect for the con&s;titution, and liberty of con&s;cience too: &s;uch per&s;ons would do well rightly to under&s;tand them&s;elves, and be con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves. Secondly, all the u&s;e that civil power can be put to, in the whole affair, is, fir&s;t, to force or pun|i&s;h tho&s;e that do not conform to the plan, or &s;econdly to force tho&s;e that like the plan to comply with its precepts. Now the fir&s;t is generally denied through the colony, that civil rulers ought not to compel men con|trary to their con&s;ciences in the wor&s;hip of God. The &s;econd is a paradox indeed, to have the civil rulers with their fines and
<PB N="178" REF="010621_0175_0F81BA4BD97620A0">
pri&s;ons, to force men to do that which they like and chu&s;e to do. Whoever puni&s;hed him&s;elf with &s;tripes or corporeal pun|i&s;hment, unle&s;s he was a papi&s;t, or a di&s;|tracted man, for his coming &s;hort of what he thought he &s;hould do? So that turn the ca&s;e which way you plea&s;e, it appears de|mon&s;tratively evident, that there is not, nor can not be any civil power rightly concern|ed, or exerci&s;ed in religious affairs, as &s;uch. The written word of God is the only and alone rule of direction in faith and practice. Civil rulers mu&s;t be very pre&s;umptuous and heaven daring to attempt to add or dimini&s;h from the &s;ure word of prophecy; and it is morally certain that it is not in their power to force or make men believe in the author of the &s;criptures, or cordially obey its pre|cepts. Therefore, of nece&s;&s;ity civil rulers mu&s;t be excluded out of the que&s;tion, they ought to be content to be where God has placed them, in the civil kingdom. But as to the civil con&s;titution of this colony, we e&s;teem it highly, and in all our memo|rials to the a&s;&s;embly, have &s;hewn our &s;ati&s;|faction therein. Indeed we have &s;uffered our&s;elves to be defrauded, or to abide under oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecution, rather than do any thing that &s;hould tend to de&s;troy the civil con&s;titution of the colony. For when
<PB N="179" REF="010621_0176_0F81BA4C8E3F1458">
we had been at great charge and pains to prepare a petition to pre&s;ent to the king in council, and &s;ent two brethren to Old Eng|land with it, they informed me, that they advi&s;ed with the mo&s;t knowing and approv|ed coun&s;ellors in &s;uch affairs, and they told our brethren that it was quite probable, that if our petition had a proper hearing, that it would &s;trike up our charter; for there was &s;uch facts done, by the execution of certain laws, the copies of which facts, we had produced from public records, and &s;ealed with the colony &s;eal. Such as the&s;e, apprehending per&s;ons for preaching the go&s;|pel, for exhortation, for wor&s;hipping God in private hou&s;es, fining and impri&s;oning for &s;uch great chri&s;tian duties. Wherefore the&s;e coun&s;ellors advi&s;ed our brethren to drop their petition, and come home, and lay the ca&s;e before our churches, and proceed in another method, viz. To &s;ue a collector, and carry the cau&s;e through the courts, and go home to England by way of an appeal. They judged that &s;uch a method would not endanger the charter like our petition. Up|on which with &s;ome other con&s;iderati|ons they complied with the advice and came home, and laid the ca&s;e before the the church's committee, and they fell in with advice; having a great value for our civil con&s;titution; &amp; if any mea&s;ures could be
<PB N="180" REF="010621_0177_0F81BA4D5C7B4280">
attended to introduce us into our &s;acred rights of free liberty of con&s;cience, and pre|&s;erve our civil privileges, we cho&s;e to com|ply with it. Upon which we pro&s;ecuted that plan through the courts, and got things almo&s;t ripe for England, and through &s;ome fault the cau&s;e died in the birth. And here we lie under the&s;e unrighteous eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, till kind providence interpo&s;e, and appear for our relief. And if our civil ru|lers (who&s;e work it is as God's mini&s;ters) do not appear to give us an equal &s;hare of li|berty, with the re&s;t of our neighbours, they alone will bear it. When he that is in the highe&s;t heavens, hears the groans that comes up before him, from &s;ecret places, and the &s;ighings of the pri&s;oners; his om|ni&s;cient eye &s;ees how many briny tears his oppre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted children eat in their &s;trong cries for mercy, for this colony and land. Wherefore I am prone to think that the time draws near, for Zion's delive|rance, when the Lord Je&s;us will awake as one out of &s;leep, and like a mighty man that &s;houteth by rea&s;on of wine, and &s;mite his enemies in the hinder parts, and put them to a perpetual reproach, P&s;alm 78, 65, 66, read al&s;o the 68 P&s;alm. I further think, that it is too late in the day, for tho&s;e that know the truth, whether learned, or un|learned,

<P>Again. It appears to me, that the reli|gious con&s;titution of this colony is a for|feiture of the charter grant, becau&s;e it ex|erci&s;es that oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecution, con|trary to its fir&s;t intent, and is the direct cau&s;e of contention and divi&s;ion, which is repugnant to the principal de&s;ign of con|&s;tituting this colony.

according to their con&s;titution. Witne&s;s, young deacon Drake of Wind&s;or, now in Hartford pri&s;on, for the mini&s;ters rates and building their meetinghou&s;e, altho' he is a bapti&s;t, (chri&s;tians renouncing their infant or former bapti&s;m, is a practice I utterly re|ject, as un&s;criptural, an error in the judg|ment attended with many &s;nares, Prov. 20.25) yet notwith&s;tanding he has made this mi&s;take, he is accounted a harmle&s;s, godly man; and he has plead the privilege of a bapti&s;t, through all the courts, and been at great expence, without relief, till at la&s;t the a&s;&s;embly has given him a mark in his hand; and notwith&s;tanding this, they have thru&s;t him to pri&s;on for former rates, with &s;everal aggravations, which I &s;hall omit. But as to what the con&s;titution does to relieve the poor deacon, he may there die, and the cry of blood, blood, go up in|to the ears of a ju&s;t God, who will e're long avenge the wrongs done to the innocent, by this murderous con&s;titution, that will &s;hew no mercy.

all the money upon the face of the earth cannot buy a pardon for con&s;cience, when it is defiled with &s;in; and the &s;cripture &s;aith, what&s;oever is not of faith, is &s;in; and no &s;eperate that can go to pri&s;on for a mi|ni&s;ter's rate, can pay the &s;ame in belief, it is duty, or according to the rule of God's word. Therefore here they are to &s;tarve or freeze, as to what the con&s;titution has done to &s;ave life. It is is true, they have been pre&s;erved, and provided for, that have been put into pri&s;on in Chri&s;t's cau&s;e; the Mo&s;t High has been very gracious and merciful to them, in providing relief, in great &s;traits; their very enemies have mini&s;tred to their nece&s;&s;ities in my certain knowledge: but no thanks due to the con&s;titution.

His di&s;tre&s;s was to be &s;ecured from the cold. He put up his de&s;ires to heaven, as he walk'd, that the merciful God would find out &s;ome way in his kind providence, to pre&s;erve life; he &s;eeing no way how he could be pre&s;erved from the cold, was over borne with di&s;tre&s;s for &s;ome way to pre&s;erve life. He repaired to one corner of the pri&s;on and in &s;ecret prayer, poured our his de&s;ires to that mer|ciful God, which heareth the groans of the pri&s;oners, in which duty he &s;aw the cau&s;e he was &s;uffering in, was God's cau&s;e, in which he might venture life and all.

back to his chamber, where he then was, the per&s;on felt in his &s;oul a &s;urrendery to the &s;overeignty of God, and dropped at his foot, and gave up his life upon the very &s;pot; and &s;aid amen, the will of the Lord be done. This and much more did the per&s;on experience. Upon this he u&s;ed means to get liberty to &s;peak with the pri|&s;on-keeper (who was then confined to a &s;ick bed) and the favour was granted&mdash;he acquainted the pri&s;on-keeper with his ca&s;e, ju&s;t as he under&s;tood it; and a&s;ked the fa|vour to lie by his fire, at fir&s;t no an&s;wer was giv|en, only the pri&s;on-keeper tried to per&s;uade the &s;eperate to pay his rate, &amp; go home, and not deny him&s;elf of his privileges and expo&s;e his life. So he re&s;ted calm in his mind with his heart affected, with the goodne&s;s of the Lord, that he could warm him&s;elf at the fire, about the &s;pace of a quarter of an hour (if I remember right) then the pri&s;on-keep|er gave his con&s;ent, that he might lie by his fire that night, which was all that the poor pri&s;oner then reque&s;ted; for he knew not what a night, or day would bring forth. But from that time forward, all the while, he was at pri&s;on, he was as the text &s;aith, in the court of the pri&s;on, never was lock't up more, but had the liberty from the garret to the celler, and had the liberty to pray and &s;ing with his chri&s;tian friends, under that

part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that the pri&s;on-keeper liv|ed in; when at other times he has been like a raging madman again&s;t the &s;aints, when they have been praying and &s;inging in the pri&s;on, lock't up in their own room &amp;c. Now this per&s;on's deliverance from pri&s;on is al&s;o worthy of notice; as I was informed by a per&s;on of undoubted credit, who was per&s;onally acquainted with the affair, which is as followeth. When this &s;eperate was carried to pri&s;on, there was a man that lived in that neighbourhood, there at the pri&s;on a tipling with his cups, that u&s;ed to be the wor&s;e for liquor from morn|ing to night when he could get it; and a bitter enemy to the &s;eperates, has threatened to knock his wife's brains out for going a|mong the &s;eperates. But &s;eeing the collec|tor put this per&s;on into pri&s;on, &s;eized this man's con&s;cience, he went home con|victed of his own wicked practice or drink|ing too much, broke it off, was never &s;een in liquor whil&s;t the &s;eperate remained in pri|&s;on; confe&s;&s;ed his fault to his wife for drinking too much, and &s;pending &s;o much money for &s;trong drink, when (&s;aid he) there is a good man in pri&s;on, that has hurt no body, confined and &s;uffering for the mini&s;ters rate, when I have &s;pent &s;o much money for &s;trong drink, and abu&s;ed my|&s;elf with it. Al&s;o he confe&s;&s;ed his fault for
<PB N="190" REF="010621_0187_0F81BA595BEAB698">
abu&s;ing his wife, for going to hear the &s;epe|rates, and promi&s;ed that he never would a|gain, and gave her liberty to go when &s;he thought fit: he tried to get his neighbours to join with him and pay the rate, and re|lea&s;e the man, but to no purpo&s;e. He vi&s;ited the per&s;on in pri&s;on &s;everal times, to contrive &s;ome way to get him out; indeed according to the account, the man was in horror in his con&s;cience all the time the innocent &s;eperate was confined, which was more than a fortnight, at length he receiv|ed for his hand labour, eight pounds of mo|ney, old tenor, and unbeknown to his wife or any body el&s;e but the pri&s;on keeper, he went and paid the pri&s;on-keeper's whole de|mand, which was above &s;even pounds of the money he had received, and ordered the pri&s;on-keeper to let the &s;eperate go home, upon which he was relea&s;ed, but the pri&s;on-keeper would not tell him by what means, neither did the per&s;on know till &s;ome time after. Thus reader the earth helped the woman, Rev. 12.16. This narrative may &s;erve to encourage and &s;trengthen tho&s;e that love Chri&s;t's cau&s;e more than their worldly intere&s;t or their own life; al&s;o to convict and &s;hame tho&s;e that dare not tru&s;t the Lord with their &s;ub&s;tance and lives, but to &s;ave them both, pay the collector his demands, and that in a grudging man|ner

and have no peace with God, nor con|&s;cience in their doings. But to clo&s;e this narrative. I would let the reader know the end of this man, that was &s;o bountiful to the &s;eperate. After he had relea&s;ed the Lord's pri&s;oner, the poor man by little and little, took to his cups like the dog to his vomit, till he had fini&s;hed his race, and doubtle&s;s died in his &s;ins. But I will re|turn to the point I was upon, &s;hewing wherein it appears to me, that this con&s;ti|tution in the force and cruelty that it exer|ci&s;es over mens con&s;ciences, is a forfeiture of the charter grant. Pray mind the words of the grant, viz. "&s;o religiou&s;ly, peaceably and civilly governed, as their good life &amp; orderly conver&s;ation may win and invite the natives of the country to the knowledge &amp; obedience of the only true God, and &s;avi|our of mankind, &amp;c." Now dear reader think &s;eriou&s;ly of the conver&s;ation, practice and government which this con&s;titution ex|erci&s;es over mens con&s;ciences and property in religious things; and judge ye, what influence can &s;uch a practice have upon the heathen, to win and invite them to the knowledge and obedience of the only true God, or Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Indeed it appears to me, that nothing hardly, is more likely to prejudice the heathen again&s;t the peaceful go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the chri&s;tian re|ligion,

than &s;uch a practice; and to leave them under the &s;trong delu&s;ions of the de|vil to believe a lie, that they might be damned. Yea I believe a Turk, to look on and &s;ee what this con&s;titution power has done among us, &s;ince the fir&s;t out power|ing of God's &s;pirit, would rather be con|firmed in the belief of Alcoran, and laugh and &s;mile, to &s;ee a people profe&s;&s;ing to be good chri&s;tians, thus treating one another. But to clo&s;e all re&s;pecting this religous con|&s;titution, and to make up my want in tak|ing every rag of covering off, that the thigh of it, may be quite naked and bare: I would join to this book, the renowned <HI>Locke's Letter on Toleration;</HI> in which my mind is expre&s;&s;ed, beyond what my poor weak abilities is able to demon&s;trate. Join|ing this letter with my performance, makes a compleat joint, a uniform plan in the whole: not that I mean to equal my&s;elf with Locke, no, by no means: but the cau&s;e of truth and equity, and the ju&s;t rights of all men, that I have in an imper|fect manner endeavoured to plead, he has abundantly e&s;tabli&s;hed and confirmed, by ungain&s;aying arguments: through which means his fame and name is had in great e&s;teem in many kingdoms, (as I am in|formed.) And whoever of my readers &s;hall think that my writing tends to hurt

the church or &s;tate, (which indeed is not my de&s;ign) I earne&s;tly beg the favour of &s;uch, to get Locke's Letter, and peru&s;e it calmly and thoroughly, through which means perhaps, you may think, more fa|vourable upon what I am &s;triving (under God) to have effected, and brought about. Al&s;o I would earne&s;tly reque&s;t of all, &s;uch as are true Briton's and chri&s;tians, that &s;et a high value upon liberty of con&s;cience, that they move forward to get Locke's Letter re-printed, two thou&s;and of them is now wanted in this colony, as a means to let light into the under&s;tanding, that the people may &s;ee where their &s;tanding now is; al&s;o what they &s;hould be as to go&s;|pel liberty. What will all our temporal liberty do us, if we be deprived of the mo&s;t important liberty, which re&s;pects our &s;ouls future and eternal being? &amp;c. Again I would recommend to my readers &s;erious peru&s;al a Book intituled, <HI>A &s;ea&s;onable plea for the liberty of con&s;cience, and the right of private judgment in matters of religion, without any controul from human authority.</HI> This book was doubtle&s;s wrote to uncover the religous con&s;titution of this colony.

That you read with that care and attention, as not to let the word &s;lip: but thro' the &s;criptures obtain the knowledge of him, whom to know a|right, is life eternal.

How are our precious youth ruined, in&s;tead of their being trained up for heaven, to be a generation of God's prai&s;e, they are trained up in the way that leads down to hell! and without &s;peedy repentance, are like to be a generation of God's dreadful wrath.

Al&s;o that you exerci&s;e your&s;elves to the ut|mo&s;t in all &s;criptural mea&s;ures, to &s;et the royal maje&s;tic crown upon Chri&s;t's dignifi|ed and exalted head; which if I mi&s;take not, the religious con&s;titution of this colony has (as much as in it lieth) taken off; or in other words, bani&s;hed him from his rightful &s;eat of government in Connecti|cut. Therefore you ought to &s;ee to it, you that are godly rulers (and in a mi&s;tical &s;en&s;e, near akin to your &s;piritual David) that you are not the la&s;t to invite and bring the king back to his hou&s;e, and rightful &s;eat of go|vernment in his church, &amp;c. 2 Sam. 19, 11, 12. Furthermore, I would humbly and earne&s;tly reque&s;t of your honors, that you

u&s;e your utmo&s;t endeavours to ca&s;t up the free go&s;pel high-way, thro' this colony, that the ran&s;omed of the Lord may return to Zion with &s;ongs of prai&s;e; and that every let and hinderance may be removed out of the way of your exalted Lord or Savior; &s;o that he may march thro' the length and breadth of this colony, without interrupti|on from men's inventions or traditions, and gather churches when and where he &s;ees fit in his wi&s;dom, and organize the &s;ame, with &s;uch officers as he has de&s;cribed in his writ|ten word, fitted and qualified therefor. Suf|fer me to acquaint you from certain &s;crip|tural knowledge, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t has a dear &s;pou&s;e, that he hath betrothed to him|&s;elf in righteou&s;ne&s;s, bought with his own precious blood, here in this colony, that is under per&s;ecution and oppre&s;&s;ion, which this book has &s;ufficiently &s;hewn. There|fore it is your bu&s;ine&s;s as God's mini&s;ters in the civil kingdom, to appear for her relief; yet it ill becomes you to u&s;e the civil &s;word in the affairs of Chri&s;t's kingdom, which is &s;piritual; but it well becomes you to u&s;e it for to break the arms of the oppre&s;&s;ors, and let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free. Jer. 21, 12. P&s;al. 72.4. This your righteous Lord &amp; Ma&s;ter, will require at your hands; the&s;e churches have improved the be&s;t of their wi&s;dom, (placing Je&s;us Chri&s;t the only Lord

Zion's good; and if you rightly apply your&s;elves to your work, the &s;trong, fervent, and con&s;tant prayers of the Godly of every profe&s;&s;ion, will much more than countervail the mocks and &s;coffs of the proud and haught, which you mu&s;t expect to meet with, if you are faithful in the great and important tru&s;t committed to you.

<P>Secondly.

Rom. 6.16. ch. 10.15. Fur|thermore you never regarded &s;ociety lines, nor mini&s;ters, as a foundation of action. If when you was invited to preach, in this or that &s;ociety, the mini&s;ter con&s;ented, &amp; the meet|ing hou&s;e open, you rejoiced therein; but if not, it hindred not, for &s;ome private hou&s;e was prepared, or barn, or hor&s;e-block, or the &s;hade of &s;ome tree, and the go&s;pel which Chri&s;t gave you, was as &s;weet and precious to you and the hearers, as in a meeting-hou&s;e; whil&s;t you was &s;ubjected to Chri&s;t, in the teaching, leading, &s;anctify|ing influences of his &s;pirit.

your ca&s;e! (as I &s;uppo&s;e it was) then I think for you to be hone&s;t men con&s;i&s;tent with your&s;elves, you ought to tell your brethren and neighbours, (that your con|trary practice has &s;tumbled) that you have &s;hamefully declined in religion, and lo&s;t a &s;en&s;e of the worth of precious never dying &s;ouls, and the &s;weet pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, that filled your hearts with holy fear of &s;inning again&s;t God, when you refu&s;ed to pay &amp;c. But now you have got wordly, carele&s;s &amp; covetous, and do not love to have your goods &s;poil'd, and pay what they unju&s;tly demand to prevent it; but you are obliged to pay it grudgingly with a coveting mind, far, very far from any true joy in the whole affair; your practice in paying your rates will not admit of any joy in God, which if duly con&s;idered, is &s;uited to convict you that your paying is wrong, if you would not &s;hut your eyes again&s;t the light, for you &s;hould know all that God requires may be done with delight in God, and peace of con&s;cience and good will to men; therefore I think that you ought to let your poor neighbours know, that you pay your rates thro' coveteou&s;ne&s;s, that you love your e&s;tates better than their &s;ouls, or the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, refu&s;ing to bear Chri&s;t's &s;weet cro&s;s. If you would be thus hone&s;t, po&s;&s;i|bly you might offer &s;ome conviction to
<PB N="238" REF="010621_0235_0F81B9EF26133CF8">
your neighbours for their good, for they would know where you be. But your re|fu&s;ing to pay &s;ome years back, and &s;aying you acted duty or was called of God &s;o to do, and now tamely &s;ubmit and pay &amp;c. I think is a flat contradiction in your prac|tice, which lieth with you to reconcile. But you are excu&s;ing your&s;elves, and &s;ay|ing it is not a cen&s;urable evil to pay, there is no warrant to deal with a church member &amp;c. Pray brethren &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider what is in your words and practice! you grant it to be an evil, but not a cen&s;urable evil to pay; &s;o that if your credit is not hurt, nor you brought under di&s;cipline, you may do what evil you plea&s;e, (almo&s;t) to &s;ave your idols and temporal intere&s;t. But dearly belov|eds, is this a mark of a child of God, or fruits that the godly bring forth? no &s;ure|ly, very far from it, what a holy and jea|lous God hates; &s;uffer me my brethren to u&s;e freedom with you, and to be in my gift and not in Zion, (which is to be clo&s;e and plain) therefore I te&s;tify if you live in the known indulgence of any evil in your hearts, which no mortal eye may &s;ee, you are not fit to be a member of the church millitant, and much le&s;s fit for the church triumphant. But what do you mean brethren, by &s;aying a cen&s;urable evil? is there any &s;in or evil that is known to be
<PB N="239" REF="010621_0236_0F81B9EF8E6C1F98">
&s;o, &amp; indulged &amp; lived in, that is not cen&s;ura|ble? if &s;o, be &s;o kind as to let me know what that &s;in is, &amp; where Chri&s;t has given the in|dulgence; for I freely confe&s;s, I never learned Chri&s;t, nor his religion &s;o. I freely own, that we are very imperfect, whil&s;t in this life, &amp; come &s;hort daily and hourly; and &s;in has too much influence in us. But then the godly are far from indulging any &s;in, in heart or practice&mdash;are con&s;tantly at war, more or le&s;s again&s;t all &s;in &amp; evil, in heart, lip or life, all their days are in the field of bat|tle, waring again&s;t all &s;in. Read the&s;e &s;crip|tures, Rom. 7.24. 1 Cor. 5.6.7.8. Mat. 7.20 to 27. Lu. 9.57, to the end. Mat. 10.37.38.39. 1 Joh. 3.17, to 21. ch. 5.17.18. La|bour brethren to get a true or right under|&s;tanding of what the&s;e &s;criptures contain, &amp; what it is to be truly godly; for I am jea|lous that there is too many that are exter|nally in this reformation, that bear the name of &s;eperates, and church members, that ne|ver was &s;eparated from an immoderate love to the world, or their heart idols; never made holy in heart, and when weighed in the ballance, will be found wanting. A|gain, I am not without fears, that the devil is laying a plot, to blow up the&s;e reforming churches, in the land, even upon this prin|ciple, and practice, viz. that there are &s;ome &s;ins and evils which may be indulged in churches. I readily grant that there is a
<PB N="240" REF="010621_0237_0F81B9F04CFC3BE8">
great deal of labour, patience and forbear|ance to be u&s;ed, with per&s;ons ignorant, that their practice is evil, when in fact it is. But when a per&s;on knows that either his words or actions is evil, contrary to the &s;criptures, and the per&s;on be indulged in his evil, or wrong way, becau&s;e his &s;in is &s;mall, this is beyond me, and I believe beyond the &s;crip|tures too, for they require us to be holy in all manner of conver&s;ation. 1 Pet. Al&s;o, whe|ther therefore ye eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the glory of God. 1 Cor. 10, 31. That you may know how &s;trict I under&s;tand the laws of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e to be, take my mind in the following &s;uppo&s;ition, (as thus) &s;uppo&s;ing a church member is apt to je&s;t or joke in the &s;pirit of the world, (which the world calls civil) and he be re|proved therefor, and retract it and own it wrong; if he &s;hould fall &s;even times in a day, and return again, &amp; &s;hew repentance, (Luke 17, 4.) we are bound to forgive him; but if he &s;hould je&s;t but once, and ju&s;tify him&s;elf in it, as being but a common infirmi|ty, or &s;mall evil, that ought to be indulged in this imperfect &s;tate; this I te&s;tify lays foundation for that labour, that &s;hould not end, till the per&s;on is bro't to repentance, or excluded the holy fellow&s;hip of the church. This my principle may be too &s;trict for &s;ome of my readers; but likely
<PB N="241" REF="010621_0238_0F81B9F113A8DA28">
you will all grant in this &s;triking light, that where a per&s;on commits facts that &s;hew enmity to God, and &s;tands to ju&s;tify him&s;elf therein; that in &s;uch a ca&s;e, after due labour, he ought to be excluded from the church. Therefore, read for your con|viction, Rom. 8.7. Becau&s;e the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God, for it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. James 4.4. The friend&s;hip of the world, is enmity with God. Here it is plain, that the &s;pirit that leads a man to je&s;t with the carnal world, &s;trikes at the whole government of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e, cannot be &s;ubject to Chri&s;t's laws; but mu&s;t be ca&s;t out, &amp;c. Again. It is generally allowed, that he that practi|ces contrary to the word of God, and al|lows him&s;elf &s;o to do, is cen&s;urable. This I think is the ca&s;e of every man, that has &s;een the &s;cripture method of &s;upporting the go&s;pel by freely contributing therefor, &s;o re|fu&s;ed to pay the &s;ociety mini&s;ter's rate, and now pay it; &s;uch a per&s;on's practice is con|trary to the following &s;criptures. I&s;a. 8.11. 12. Here the Lord &s;aith, walk not in the way of this people, &s;aying, &s;ay ye not, a confederacy, to all them to whom this peo|ple &s;hall &s;ay a confederacy; but you that pay, &s;ay (at lea&s;t in your practice) no, Lord, it will not do now to follow your directi|ons, if I do, they will wa&s;te my e&s;tate; I

mu&s;t walk in their way for the pre&s;ent, &amp; confederate with them, in paying the rate, they demand, till I am &s;et off by them. Ver. 20. To the law and to the te&s;timony,&mdash; the Mo&s;t High requires us all to walk; but your practice &s;aith not &s;o Lord, I mu&s;t comply with men's inventions, and traditi|ons, to &s;ave my &s;ub&s;tance, &amp;c. But I &s;hould note here, that there is no mu&s;t in the ca&s;e, only what comes from a di&s;tru&s;t of God, and a covetous heart. You &s;ay, if you do not pay, they will wa&s;te your e&s;tates; you &s;peak pre&s;umtuou&s;ly, what you do not know, for it has often happened to them, that endeavour to walk uprightly with God in this ca&s;e, and practice their principles, that the collector has been re&s;trained from taking any thing; al&s;o when they have been &s;uffered to go forward, hardened in their &s;inful practice, &amp; &s;trained their neigh|bours goods, or impri&s;oned their bodies, &s;ome tender con&s;ciences have been waked up to &s;ee the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion done to their neighbours, that they have paid their rates for them, &s;o none of their goods have been wa&s;ted; or it may be po&s;&s;ible, if not the ca&s;e, that the Devil out of policy, when he &s;ees his kingdom &s;haking, may influence his in&s;truments to club together and pay the &s;eperates rates, in order to &s;ave his &s;cheme and kingdom, from &s;haking to pieces.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="010621_0240_0F81B9F2C4ABB590">My goods have been &s;trained away, and carried off, and kept awhile, and returned again, without any concern or care of mine, one way or other. Through which means (I &s;uppo&s;e) my &s;ub&s;tance and all the flocks in the &s;ociety re&s;ted quiet for years toge|ther. But had I been &s;o fooli&s;h, and in|con&s;i&s;tent with my&s;elf, and the word of God, as to have paid the collector's demands; I &s;hould doubtle&s;s have opened the door for the oppre&s;&s;or to have wa&s;ted the &s;ub&s;tance of the flock. Again, &s;ee Phil. 3.16. Ne|verthele&s;s whereunto we have already attain|ed, let us walk by the &s;ame rule, let us mind the &s;ame things. You brethren that refu&s;ed to pay from the knowledge of the &s;cripture rule of &s;upporting the go&s;pel and now pay, you go again&s;t this precept, and in your practice, neither walk by the &s;ame rule, nor mind the &s;ame things, and for no other rea&s;on only to &s;ave your e&s;tates, or unrighteous mammon. That in your own imagination, the &s;criptures are not to be re|garded in this ca&s;e, for your wi&s;dom has found out a better way, much more pru|dent and &s;aving, to pre&s;erve your &s;ub&s;tance &amp;c. But know brethren of a certainty, that the &s;criptures &s;hall not fall to the ground unfulfilled, Luke 17.33. Again &s;ee Gal. 2.18. For if I build again the
<PB N="244" REF="010621_0241_0F81B9F69790B700">
things which I de&s;troyed, I make my&s;elf a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or. It appears to me brethren, that Paul was more hone&s;t and upright than you be; he rea&s;ons ju&s;tly according to the true nature of things; but you have got wi&s;er (in your imagination) than the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle, and have found out a way to build again the things that you de|&s;troyed, in word, principle and practice; and hold your&s;elves innocent. You ought to remember how you have acted in years pa&s;t, when &s;ome of you &s;en&s;ibly loved the Lord, his cau&s;e, and the &s;alvation of &s;ouls, above all things created. What prayers you put up to God, that this wicked oppre&s;&s;ive &s;cheme of &s;upporting a pretended go&s;pel by force, (wa&s;ting mens e&s;tates, &amp; impri&s;oning their bodies for that end) might be detected and brought down, when your hearts was in &s;ome mea&s;ure right with God, and your practice agreable thereto; then you gave this oppre&s;&s;ive &s;cheme a ble&s;&s;ed &s;hock, and If you had kept in love with Chri&s;t's &s;weet &amp; worthy cro&s;s, and practiced &s;teadfa&s;t in your principles; it is likely to me that kind providence would find out &s;ome way of re|lief by this time. But now by your pay|ing, you &s;ink and deny your former te&s;ti|mony, harden your poor neighbours, that begin to wake up, and their con&s;ciences to

&s;corch them for their cruel oppre&s;&s;ion to|wards you; they improve your paying to heal their chaffed con&s;ciences, for now there is no goods wa&s;ted, nor violence u&s;ed, for you pay their demands your&s;elves, and it is got to be brave times in &s;uch &s;ocieties, where there is no public witne&s;s held up, that the go&s;pel &s;hould not be made merchandize of. But pray brethren think, think of the dread|ful con&s;equence of your practice. You take your &s;ub&s;tance which Chri&s;t has pur|cha&s;ed with his precious blood, and put in|to your &s;teward&s;hip, and charged you to im|prove the &s;ame to his glory, and give the &s;ame to &s;upport unconverted mini&s;ters, (which doubtle&s;s is mo&s;tly the ca&s;e) whom the &s;cripture calls wolves, dogs, thieves, robbers, which &s;teal, kill and de&s;troy. Joh. 10.1.10. Mat. 7.15. Yea, properly &s;peak|ing, &s;uch are &s;oul murderers, leading their flocks down to hell. Mat. 15.14. Now you take your &s;ub&s;tance, which the Lord challenges as his, to be otherwi&s;e im|proved to his glory, and pay with your own hand, or under di&s;gui&s;e, let your wives or children pay to &s;upport all this dreadful, &s;oul-ruining practice. Dear brethren, la|bour above all things to get near to God, &amp; take a view of your conduct in &s;cripture light, perhaps hell is peopled through your

<P>Again. You are told, to be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and &s;upplication, with thank&s;giving, let your reque&s;t be made known unto God. Phil. 4.6. But when you pay, you go abrea&s;t to this ble&s;&s;ed direction, for it is anxious care, &s;in|ful fear of lo&s;ing your &s;ub&s;tance, makes you pay. You are much without a &s;pirit of prayer, and cannot ble&s;s God for your paying, becau&s;e you pay grudgingly and cannot pay otherwi&s;e. Mat. 7.18. There is no thank&s;giving concerned in the whole af|fair. But if you &s;tand &s;teadfa&s;t in the truth, and refu&s;e to pay, or have any concern with the collector, more or le&s;s, only to hold up truth to him, in meekne&s;s and love; then through free grace you can cheerfully and &s;weetly comply with every part of this ble&s;&s;ed direction, which is worth mountains of gold and &s;ilver, and ought to be retain|ed in every heart as a mo&s;t valuable, rich trea&s;ure, &s;o as to practice the &s;ame, as in P&s;al. 119.11. Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not &s;in again&s;t thee. Did you &s;ubmit to the direction here given,

you would never pay another rate; and if all the brethren thro' the colony, that has come into this reformation, would from love to God, and the rule the &s;cripture gives to &s;upport the go&s;pel, refu&s;e to pay another rate, I much believe you would in a few years &s;ee &s;ome way found out in provi|dence for your relief. Light in this affair is got &s;o far into the under&s;tanding of this generation, that &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion followed, would &s;oon &s;hake many a church or &s;ociety into pieces, that would pre&s;ume to practice in it, to drain away the &s;ub&s;tance of their neighbours, who &s;tand in no relation with them in religious matters, who differ from them in many things in principle &amp; prac|tice, it is again&s;t the light of nature, rea|&s;on and &s;cripture.

Matt. 28, 20. If you have counted the co&s;t aright in en|tring into the mini&s;try, you have counted it as Paul did, &s;ee Phili. 3, 7 to 7. ch. 4, 11.12.13. 2 Cor. 6, 3 to 11.

a per&s;on void of humility and divine love. The per&s;on deluded, layeth great &s;tre&s;s up|on his feelings, and the impre&s;&s;ions upon his mind, neglecting a due examination from what &s;pirit they come; he can neglect duty here and there, and commit this fault, and that as &s;uits his mind, and cry grace, free grace; and in his vain imagination, leave Chri&s;t to make up for his mi&s;conduct, when the truth is, the per&s;on that hath the true operations of the holy &s;pirit, and ob|tains pardoning mercy from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is led to take up his cro&s;s and live a life of &s;elf denial, and thro' Chri&s;t's free &s;pirit, en|gages in all &s;elf mortifying duties required from love to Chri&s;t, &s;atisfied in his will, &s;en&s;ible of his own weakne&s;s and inability thereto, ever looking out of him&s;elf for re|newed &s;trength from Chri&s;t, to perform all the duties required to the glory and honour of Chri&s;t. Again when a per&s;on has been &s;nared with Satan's angelick light, a fal&s;e &s;pirit and comes to &s;ee it, the devil &s;tands ready to catch the mind with a legal &s;pirit, and fix it down to the letter, and get the per&s;on to be very regular, and as he thinks u&s;e a great deal of chri&s;tian prudence, (when it is wordly wi&s;dom) which drops a man &s;hort of living a life of faith on the Son of God, daily and hourly looking to the Lord for wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength;

upon which a per&s;on will get &s;ettled upon his lee&s;e, living upon his graces, light, knowledge and attainments, without grow|ing in grace, or getting further victory over the corruptions and idols of the heart. If a preacher, he will content him&s;elf with light and gifts, in &s;peaking a word of know|ledge without divine love, or the energy of the holy &s;pirit penetrating into the heart; &s;anctifying and conforming to God's holy law &amp;c. And if a hearer, he will content him&s;elf with a&s;&s;enting to the truth preach|ed, and when his ca&s;e is truly di&s;cribed, con&s;cience &s;aith truth, truth: yet the per&s;on does not wake up in earne&s;t, to put them truths into practice; he will be plea&s;ed in hearing, but not in pain in his heart, for divine &s;trength to do the will of God; he is inclined to lay all over upon the mini&s;ter to do all in public wor&s;hip, and if the mini&s;ter is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;pirit of God, to hold forth the truth clearly in &s;ome demon&s;tra|tion of truth, he is mightily taken there|with; but if duty is put to him, he is &s;hut up, and pinched in his mind, till he is di&s;|charged of that duty; then he is pretty ea&s;y without the pre&s;ence of God, till &s;ome trying duty pre&s;ents, then he is tryed again.
