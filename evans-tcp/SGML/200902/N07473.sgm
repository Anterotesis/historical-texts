<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Subject of the following Pages was as much di&s;puted in the la&s;t century, as per|haps any one controverted point in divi|nity; and very often, with too much warmth and uncharitablene&s;s. When it came in my way in the cour&s;e of my public lectures, &s;ome time before the la&s;t winter vacation, I could not avoid con&s;idering it; but I determined to do it as briefly as would be con&s;i&s;tent with giving the Students of the College any tolerable view of the arguments and objections of the contending par|ties. And the&s;e I exhibited, in a great mea&s;ure, tho' not always exactly, in their own words.</P>
<P>SOON after delivering the la&s;t of my lectures upon the &s;ubject, I was very unexpectedly &s;urpriz|ed with a reque&s;t from &s;ome of my hearers, who told me it was al&s;o the de&s;ire of many others, that I would con&s;ent to their being made public by the pre&s;s. I put them off from time to time for &s;everal months, in hopes they would grow cool and drop the motion; but finding it quite otherwi&s;e, I at length yielded with reluctance to repeated &s;olicitations.</P>
<P><PB REF="009541_0003_0F768BC755162D98">I SHALL not wonder if I am cen&s;ured by &s;ome of all parties, for offering but a very &s;mall part of what <HI>they</HI> could have &s;aid for them&s;elves. It would have been ea&s;y to have heaped up much more on every &s;ide; but I was unwilling to tire my audience with the length of a difficult argu|ment; which, for the &s;ake of &s;ome, into who&s;e hands it may now fall, I have made much &s;hor|ter than it was delivered in the college: For I am &s;en&s;ible that controver&s;ial tracts &s;oon become tedious to per&s;ons who have not been u&s;ed to clo&s;e and long attention.</P>
<P>AS I was far from expecting that I &s;hould ever be de&s;ired to publi&s;h what is here emitted, I was not careful, when writing, to note in the margin from whom I made extracts; and I have not been able now, at &s;ix months di&s;tance, to recollect &s;ome of them, and give them credit for what was taken from them.</P>
<P>IF a view of the difficulty of the &s;ubject here con&s;idered, may be improved to promote charity between &s;uch as differ in their &s;entiments about it; or if any &s;erious enquirers for truth, &s;hall find a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their &s;earch after it, from what is here put into their hands; I &s;hall be humbly thankful to God for it, and not be &s;orry that I con&s;ented to permit, what at the time of doing it, I had much rather have forborn.</P>

<HEAD>The Doctrine of <HI>REPROBATION</HI> con&s;idered with <HI>Candor. PART I.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JUDE, <HI>ver. IV.</HI></BIBL>
<P>FOR there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condem|nation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING &s;poken largely of the doctrine of <HI>Election</HI> in &s;everal late di&s;cour&s;es; I mu&s;t now proceed to con&s;ider the doctrine of <HI>Reprobation</HI> al&s;o, and &s;ee what ac|count the &s;criptures give us of it. And I do this the rather, becau&s;e I believe it is very much owing to mi&s;apprehen&s;ions, or want of due con|&s;ideration of what the &s;criptures teach us con|cerning the <HI>latter</HI> of the&s;e points; that &s;o many prejudices have ari&s;en in the minds of men again&s;t the whole doctrine of the divine decrees.&mdash;Now the words which have been read at this time, may &s;erve well enough as an <HI>Introduction</HI> to the &s;cripture account of <HI>Reprobation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="009541_0005_0F768BC8E47E29C0">IN the preceding ver&s;e the apo&s;tle tells tho&s;e to whom he directs his epi&s;tle, that <HI>it was need|ful for him to write unto them, and exhort them, that they &s;hould contend earne&s;tly for the faith which was once delivered to the &s;aints.</HI> The rea&s;on why this exhortation was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, we have in the words before us, <HI>For there are cer|tain men crept in unawares&mdash;ungodly men&mdash;deny|ing the only Lord God, &amp;c.</HI> There were certain men, ungodly in life, and damnably heretical in doctrine, who had craftily &s;lipt into the church unob&s;erved. And there was great danger le&s;t by the wicked practices and damnable here&s;ies, which <HI>the&s;e brought in privily; others</HI> al&s;o &s;hould be induced to <HI>put away a good con&s;cience,</HI> and <HI>make &s;hipwreck of their faith.</HI> And le&s;t any &s;hould think it was <HI>only a chance which had happened unto them</HI> that the church was at this time &s;o infe&s;ted with the&s;e <HI>deceitful workers,</HI> and <HI>&s;ons of perdition;</HI> the apo&s;tle therefore a&s;&s;ures them, that this whole matter came to pa&s;s <HI>by the determinate coun&s;el and foreknowledge of God;</HI> that the&s;e very men <HI>were before of old ordained to this condemnation.</HI> Nor need any wonder to hear him &s;ay &s;o, for it was nothing but what had <HI>been &s;poken of before by the apo&s;tles of our Lord;</HI> v. 14. And even <HI>Enoch, the &s;eventh from Adam, had prophe&s;ied of them.</HI> v. 17.</P>
<P><HI>BY the condemnation to which the&s;e men were before of old ordained&mdash;</HI>&s;ome under&s;tand, <HI>that reprobate mind</HI> to which God gave them over to do tho&s;e things which are not conve|nient, and to corrupt and pervert the doctrines
<PB N="7" REF="009541_0006_0F768BC9B8AAC278">
of the go&s;pel.&mdash;Others under&s;tand <HI>the ju&s;t dere|liction of God,</HI> by which they were permitted, for their former &s;ins, to make &s;hipwreck of their <HI>own faith,</HI> and to become the authors of damna|ble error and here&s;y in <HI>others,</HI> and at la&s;t to be condemned them&s;elves forever.&mdash;In fine, <HI>by this condemnation,</HI> &s;ome under&s;tand <HI>eternal damnation it&s;elf.</HI> For &s;o the original word <GAP DESC="foreign"> is often u&s;ed el&s;ewhere in the New Te&s;tament.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Matt. XXIII. 14. Mark XII. 40. Luke XX. 47. Rom. III. 8. 1 Tim. III. 6.</NOTE> And it is certain from the whole progre&s;s of <HI>this epi&s;tle,</HI> that the apo&s;tle <HI>Jude</HI> is here &s;peaking of tho&s;e very per&s;ons, as <HI>already crept</HI> into the church, whom the apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> had foretold <HI>would creep into it;</HI> and concerning whom he &s;ays, that <HI>their judgment now of a long time lingreth not, and their damnation &s;lumbreth not.</HI> 2 Pet. II. 3. Upon the whole, in whichever of the&s;e &s;en&s;es we take the expre&s;&s;ion, it will amount to much the &s;ame thing. For if by <HI>this condemna|tion</HI> we under&s;tand, either only the <HI>divine dere|liction,</HI> or only <HI>that reprobate mind</HI> con&s;equent upon it; yet we mu&s;t under&s;tand it of <HI>&s;uch a reprobate mind,</HI> or <HI>&s;uch a dereliction,</HI> as will certainly end in <HI>the damnation of hell;</HI> becau&s;e the apo&s;tle expre&s;sly tells us, [ver. 13.] that <HI>to the per&s;ons under this condemnation is re&s;erved the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s forever.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>to this condemnation,</HI> he &s;ays, they were <HI>before of old ordained,</HI> or, as it is in the original, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>before of old written.</HI> That is, &s;ay &s;ome, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>concerning whom it was
<PB N="8" REF="009541_0007_0F768BCA4E1E8468">
before written.</HI> Thus they &s;uppo&s;e it was in tho&s;e remarkable words of the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 The&s;. II. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <HI>And then &s;hall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord &s;hall con&s;ume with the &s;pirit of his mouth, and &s;hall de&s;troy with the brightne&s;s of his coming: Even him who&s;e coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and &s;igns, and lying wonders, and with all deceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, in them that peri&s;h; becau&s;e they received not the love of the truth, that they might be &s;aved. And for this cau&s;e God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ion, that they &s;hould believe a lie: That they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The &s;ame per&s;ons they &s;uppo&s;e to have been written of before by <HI>Peter</HI> al&s;o, when he &s;ays, 2 Pet. II. 1, 2, 3. <HI>There &s;hall be fal&s;e teachers among you, who privily &s;hall bring in damnable here&s;ies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon them&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truction. And many &s;hall follow their pernicious ways, by rea&s;on of whom the way of truth &s;hall be evil &s;poken of. And through covetou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall they with feigned words make merchandi&s;e of you: who&s;e judgment now of a long time lingreth not, and their dam|nation &s;lumbreth not.&mdash;</HI>Others again &s;uppo&s;e, that the expre&s;&s;ion refers to the words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour recorded Matt. XXIV. 4, 5, 10, 11, 14. <HI>Take heed that no man deceive you. For many &s;hall come in my name, &s;aying, I am Chri&s;t: and &s;hall deceive many. And then &s;hall many be offended, and &s;hall betray one another, and
<PB N="9" REF="009541_0008_0F768BCC8B948DC8">
&s;hall hate one another. And many fal&s;e pro|phets &s;hall ari&s;e, and &s;hall deceive many.&mdash;And this go&s;pel of the kingdom &s;hall be preached in all the world, for a witne&s;s unto all nations, and then &s;hall the end come.</HI></P>
<P>NOW tho' it be certain, that <HI>Peter</HI> (at le&s;t) had written before of the&s;e very per&s;ons, and of their condemnation to eternal puni&s;hment; who are here &s;aid to be <HI>before of old written to this condemnation:</HI> Yet I cannot per&s;wade my&s;elf, that they are &s;aid to be before <HI>of old</HI> written to this condemnation, upon account of them and their condemnation's having been written of before by <HI>Peter,</HI> or <HI>any other apo&s;tle.</HI> For what had been written by <HI>Peter,</HI> or po&s;&s;ibly by <HI>any other apo&s;tle,</HI> concerning the&s;e per&s;ons, could not be &s;aid to have been written <HI>of old,</HI> but <HI>of late,</HI> when <HI>Jude</HI> wrote this epi&s;tle.&mdash;More|over, <HI>the prophe&s;ies which went before</HI> con|cerning the&s;e per&s;ons, and their condemnation, are manife&s;tly &s;poken of as a thing di&s;tinct from their being <HI>before of old ordained</HI> or written <HI>to condemnation.</HI> For after the apo&s;tle hath &s;aid, that the men who were <HI>crept in unawares, were before of old ordained to condemnation;</HI> he goes on to &s;ay, v. 14. <HI>And Enoch al&s;o the &s;eventh from Adam prophe&s;ied of the&s;e.</HI> And then he proceeds, v. 17, 18, to put his <HI>beloved in remembrance of the words which were &s;poken before by the apo&s;tles of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: How that they told them there &s;hould be mockers in the la&s;t time, who &s;hould walk after their own ungodly lu&s;ts. The&s;e be they who &s;eparate them|&s;elves
<PB N="10" REF="009541_0009_0F768BCC955AA4F0">
&mdash;not having the &s;pirit.</HI>&mdash;From all which it appears to me that their being <HI>before of old ordained</HI> or written <HI>to condemnation,</HI> mu&s;t be under&s;tood according to the &s;en&s;e, of perhaps the bigger and better part of prote&s;tant expo&s;i|tors of the la&s;t century, to refer, not to any thing which had been &s;poken or written about the&s;e per&s;ons, either by prophets or apo&s;tles under the in&s;piration of God; but to the determination of the divine mind concerning them, namely, to the decree of <HI>Reprobation</HI> (as it hath been called) which was <HI>before of old,</HI> even from the days of eternity.&mdash;This may &s;uffice for the meaning of the <HI>Condemnation</HI> &s;poken of in my text; and of <HI>certain men's being before of old ordained to it.&mdash;</HI> The next thing to be con&s;idered is,</P>
<P><HI>THE character of the per&s;ons ordained to this condemnation.&mdash;</HI> And this is, <HI>ungodly men, turning the grace of God into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, deny|ing the only Lord God, and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> or as the apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> prophe&s;ying of the &s;ame per&s;ons expre&s;&s;es it, 2 Pet. ii. 1. <HI>Fal&s;e teachers who privily &s;hall bring in damnable here&s;ies, even denying the Lord that bought them.&mdash;</HI> The &s;um of the matter then may be taken up in the two following propo&s;itions, namely,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>THAT there are certain men from eter|nity ordained of God to condemnation.&mdash;</HI> And,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>THAT the&s;e are men of wicked lives, or damnably heretical principles, or both.&mdash;</HI> The great controver&s;y between the <HI>Supralap&s;arian Calvini&s;ts</HI> and the <HI>Arminians</HI> concerning the <HI>decree of Reprobation,</HI> will fall in mo&s;t naturally
<PB N="11" REF="009541_0010_0F768BCD58ED9398">
to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed under the &s;econd of the&s;e propo|&s;itions. However it may not be ami&s;s, before I proceed to that, to &s;peak &s;omething briefly to the fir&s;t, viz.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>THAT there are certain men from eternity ordained of God to condemnation.&mdash;The election</HI> (&s;ays the apo&s;tle) <HI>hath obtained it, and the re&s;t were blinded,</HI> or hardned. Rom. xi. 7. And again, Rom. ix. 22. <HI>What if God willing to &s;hew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-&s;uffering the ve&s;&s;els of wrath fit|ted to de&s;truction.&mdash;</HI> The propo&s;ition before us may be illu&s;trated and prov'd under three par|ticulars, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT &s;ome of mankind are certainly ordain'd of God to condemnation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THAT this divine ordination is from eternity.&mdash;</HI> And,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THAT the per&s;ons &s;o ordained to condem|nation are determined.&mdash;</HI> What I intend by each of the&s;e, I think will be almo&s;t allowed me by all parties, except <HI>Socinians.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t THEN, <HI>Some of mankind are certainly ordained of God to condemnation.&mdash;</HI> By <HI>condem|nation</HI> I intend <HI>eternal damnation</HI> it&s;elf; or that mi&s;ery which will be the everla&s;ting portion of them, who die in their &s;ins. By being <HI>ordained</HI> to this mi&s;ery or condemnation, I intend, that <HI>there is a determination of the divine will con|cerning it;</HI> that none drop into perdition with|out the will of God, or without his antecedently determining (in &s;ome &s;en&s;e) <HI>that</HI> they &s;hould. Not that the determination of the divine will is
<PB N="12" REF="009541_0011_0F768BCE1F6F7088">
either the moral or the phy&s;ical cau&s;e of mens &s;in and mi&s;ery. The <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> generally reject &s;uch a thought as this. And I here only &s;up|po&s;e, that a determination of the will of God, is nece&s;&s;arily antecedent to the condemnation of men; that &s;ince <HI>the kingdom of God ruleth over all,</HI> &s;o that <HI>not a &s;parrow falleth to the ground without him;</HI> much le&s;s can any of his rea|&s;onable creatures peri&s;h, without his determin|ing before, at lea&s;t to permit that they &s;hould.</P>
<P>NOW it is certain that &s;ome of mankind &s;hall be mi&s;erable forever, from the expre&s;s words of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, Matt. xxv. 46. <HI>The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment:</HI> And if &s;ome of mankind &s;hall be mi&s;erable forever, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e they are antecedently ordained of God to this condemnation; or el&s;e we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that God don't know of it before it happens; or la&s;tly, that tho' he knows of it, yet he is not able to prevent it. For if God knows of mens falling into condemnation before it happens; and could prevent it, if he thought fit; we mu&s;t certainly conclude, that he determines not to prevent, but &s;uffer it (which is all I intend by ordaining or writing it) or el&s;e it could never happen. Now that God knows of mens falling into condemnation before it happens is certain, from his foretelling of it: And it is no le&s;s cer|tain that he could prevent it, if (all things con|&s;ider'd) he judg'd it wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t &s;o to do; for all things are po&s;&s;ible with him; and e&s;pe|cially the hearts of all men are in his hands, and he can turn them whither&s;oever he plea&s;es. And
<PB N="13" REF="009541_0012_0F768BCEE7768DE8">
therefore, it cannot but be allowed, that he de|termines not to prevent it; or in other words, by which I intend the &s;ame thing, that they who fall into condemnation, are ordained of God to it, not by an <HI>effective,</HI> but <HI>only</HI> by a <HI>permi&s;&s;ive</HI> decree.&mdash;I proceed to &s;ay</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THAT this divine ordination is from eternity. Or that God hath from eternity deter|mined to permit &s;ome of mankind to fall into condemnation.</HI></P>
<P>THE truth of this will appear undeniably from con&s;idering the perfection of the know|ledge and power of God. For it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e that he, <HI>who&s;e kingdom ruleth over all,</HI> and who is able to prevent what he plea&s;es, &s;hould know that any thing will come to pa&s;s, which he does not at the &s;ame time determine to permit, and not to hinder. And therefore, &s;ince God did from eternity know of the falling of &s;ome of mankind into everla&s;ting condemnation, he mu&s;t from eternity have determined to per|mit it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE very per&s;ons &s;o ordained or written to condemnation are determined.&mdash;</HI> This likewi&s;e fol|lows from the certainty and exactne&s;s of the foreknowledge of God. For whether we &s;up|po&s;e the decree of God to be antecedent in or|der of nature to his foreknowledge, or his fore|knowledge antecedent to his decree, (which it would be be&s;ide my purpo&s;e to di&s;pute here) yet &s;ince he knows beforehand the very per&s;ons, who will fall into condemnation; he mu&s;t de|termine beforehand, at lea&s;t to permit tho&s;e very per&s;ons &s;o to do.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="009541_0013_0F768BCF8FAE2CE8">UPON the whole, if &s;ome of mankind are cer|tainly ordained, or written of God to condem|nation; if this divine ordination is from eterni|ty; and if the very per&s;ons &s;o ordained or writ|ten to condemnation are determined; then it is true that there are certain men from eternity or|dained or written of God to condemnation; which was my fir&s;t propo&s;ition.&mdash;I &s;hall con|clude at pre&s;ent, with ju&s;t ob&s;erving, <HI>that this doctrine, as I have explained it, is far from mak|ing God the author of tho&s;e &s;ins which he hath determined to puni&s;h everla&s;tingly.&mdash;</HI> For the dimme&s;t eye may &s;ee, that <Q>they who affirm, that God hath from eternity <HI>decreed</HI> to <HI>permit</HI> tho&s;e &s;ins to be committed, which he certainly knew would be committed if he prevented them not; and that he accordingly does per|mit them, do not hereby make him the <HI>author</HI> of &s;in. God's &s;uffering his creatures to &s;in, when it is in his power to hinder them, is not to be the author of &s;in, nor is God in <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> or in <HI>mercy</HI> obliged to exert his power in hin|dring per&s;ons (in a &s;tate of trial) from &s;inning, tho' he knows they will &s;in if he does not, and that their &s;inning will bring ruin upon them.</Q> If it was incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> or <HI>mercy</HI> of God, to leave creatures in <HI>a &s;tate of trial,</HI> to exerci&s;e the freedom of their own wills, what|ever the fore&s;een event may be; it would be in|con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> of God, ever to put any of his creatures in <HI>a &s;tate of trial for eternity.</HI></P>

<P>IN the former part I propo&s;ed to con&s;ider the two following propo&s;itions, viz.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>THAT there are certain men, from eternity, ordain'd of God to condemnation.&mdash;</HI> And</P>

<P>THE <HI>Supralap&s;arians</HI> then reply to the <HI>Hy|pothe&s;is</HI> above, that there can be no certain pre&s;cience of future contingencies; that it im|plies a contradiction, that things which are not certainly to be, &s;hould be certainly fore&s;een; for if they are certainly fore&s;een, they mu&s;t certainly be: So while they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be contingent, they are yet affirmed to be certain, by &s;aying that they are certainly fore|&s;een. When God decrees that any thing &s;hall be, it hath from that a certain futurition, and as &s;uch it is certainly fore&s;een by him. An uncertain fore&s;ight is an act in its nature imperfect, becau&s;e it may be a mi&s;take, and &s;o is incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine perfections.

<PB N="26" REF="009541_0025_0F768BD954B65288">
may not be, and yet that it is certainly fore&s;een by God. God (&s;ay they) cannot fore&s;ee things, but as he decrees them, and &s;o gives them a fu|turition, and therefore this pre&s;cience antece|dent to his decree, mu&s;t be rejected as a thing impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THEY &s;ay further, that decrees upon a fore|&s;ight of what men will do, if they did not involve any contradictions are yet imperfect in their nature, and &s;ubject the will and acts of God to a creature, and &s;o are incon&s;i&s;tent with the independency of the nature and will of God. And that &s;uch a conditionate decree is an act in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, whether it &s;hall be or not, and therefore incon&s;i&s;tent with infinite perfection.</P>
<P>AND as to what the <HI>Arminians</HI> &s;ay con|cerning the inefficacy and re&s;i&s;tiblene&s;s of di|vine grace, they object, that the &s;criptures teach us every where to offer up all prai&s;e and glory to God; to acknowledge that all is of him, and to humble our&s;elves, as being nothing be|fore him. Now if we were elected, not by a free act of his, but by what he fore&s;aw that we would be; &s;o that his grace is not effica|cious by its own force, but by the good u&s;e that we make of it; then the glory and prai&s;e of all the good we do, and of God's kind pur|po&s;es to us, were due to our&s;elves. He de|&s;igns, according to the other doctrine, equal|ly well to all men; and all the difference a|mong them will ari&s;e neither from God's in|tention to them, nor from his a&s;&s;i&s;tances; but
<PB N="27" REF="009541_0026_0F768BDA106FD708">
from the good u&s;e that he fore&s;aw they would make of the&s;e favours, which he was to give in common to all mankind.

For to pray for &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tances, as are always given to all men, and are &s;uch that the whole good of them &s;hall wholly depend upon our&s;elves, would &s;ound very odly; whereas in truth we pray for <HI>&s;omething that is &s;pecial,</HI> and <HI>that we hope &s;hall be effectual.</HI> We do not, we cannot pray in earne&s;t for that, which we know all men, as well as we our&s;elves, have at all times.

<P><HI>THAT the Objections of both &s;ides again&s;t &s;ome part of the &s;cheme of their opponents, are difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible to be an&s;wered; which is at lea&s;t a &s;trong pre&s;umption, that there are &s;ome things ami&s;s in both &s;chemes.</HI> The <HI>Supralap|&s;arian</HI> objections again&s;t an election upon a fore&s;ight of faith and good works; and their arguments for the freedom, and the effi|cacy of divine grace (at lea&s;t in many in|&s;tances) &s;eem to be of great force, if not ir|re&s;i&s;tible. Nor is there le&s;s weight, on the other hand, in what the <HI>Arminians</HI> and others object, again&s;t God's concurring immediately by a determinative influence to the producti|on of intrin&s;ically evil actions.

<P><HI>That they are both agreed in joining &s;ome things together, which have no connection with each other in the nature of them, and which the &s;criptures have &s;et far a&s;under.</HI> Or in other words, They are both agreed that <HI>election</HI> and <HI>reprobation</HI> mu&s;t be &s;et upon much the &s;ame foot.

<P>THE very oppo&s;ite &s;chemes of the <HI>Supra|lap&s;arians</HI> and <HI>Arminians</HI> have both been con&s;idered in the foregoing parts, together with &s;ome of the difficulties wherewith the two contending parties mutually pre&s;s each other.

<P>THE <HI>Sublap&s;arians</HI> then maintain,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Supralap&s;arian doctrine of God's concurring immediately, by a determinative influ|ence, to the production of all the actions of men, whether good or evil, ought not to be admitted.&mdash;</HI> For, they &s;ay, this doctrine &s;uppo&s;es, that God cannot form a creature with a power of moving it&s;elf, and determining any of its own
<PB N="33" REF="009541_0032_0F768BDFD189DA58">
actions, without his efficacious power and in|fluence fir&s;t moving and predetermining it to the matter of them; that this highly reflects on the wi&s;dom and power of God, and en|tirely takes away the very po&s;&s;ibility of exer|ci&s;ing divine ju&s;tice; it being utterly incon|ceivable, that any creature &s;hould be a pro|per object of rewards and puni&s;hments, which neither hath, nor ever had, or could have, a power of determining any of its own actions. That this doctrine al&s;o de&s;troys the di&s;tincti|on between <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>voluntary</HI> agents, and brings all the operations of the <HI>latter,</HI> under laws of equal nece&s;&s;ity with tho&s;e, according to which the motions of the <HI>former</HI> are exci|ted. For if what we call voluntary agents are efficaciou&s;ly determined by God to all their operations, then they can no more refrain from doing what they do, than the fire can cea&s;e from burning, when it is &s;upplied with proper fewel, and fanned with &s;ufficient air.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sublap&s;arian Calvini&s;ts</HI> farther alledge, <HI>that this doctrine of being determined by God to all our actions is</HI> AN UTTER STRANGER TO ANTIQUITY. That it was fir&s;t &s;tarted by <HI>Aquinas</HI> in the thirteenth century. That be|fore, it was in general held, that the <HI>provi|dence</HI> of God extended it&s;elf to all things what|&s;oever: <HI>He thought</HI> this was done by God's <HI>con|curring immediately</HI> to the production of every thought, action, motion, or mode; &s;o that God was the fir&s;t and immediate cau&s;e of
<PB N="34" REF="009541_0033_0F768BE013FFA4E8">
every thing that was done. And in order to the explaining of the joint production of every thing by God as the FIRST, and by the creatures as the <HI>&s;econd cau&s;e,</HI> he taught (at lea&s;t &s;o his followers have under&s;tood him) that by a phy&s;ical influence the will was pre|determined by God to all things whether good or bad; &s;o that the will could not be &s;aid to be free in that particular in&s;tance <HI>in &s;en&s;u compo&s;ito,</HI> tho' it was in general &s;till free in all its actions <HI>in &s;en&s;u divi&s;o:</HI> A di&s;tinction &s;o &s;a|cred, and &s;o much u&s;ed among them (as Bi|&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI> ob&s;erves) that I chu&s;e to give it in their own terms, rather than tran&s;late, or attempt to explain them. This pa&s;&s;ed down among the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> with the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> who were of <HI>Aquinas</HI>'s own order; and hath &s;ince been received by the <HI>Supralap&s;arian Calvini&s;ts</HI> among <HI>Prote&s;tants;</HI> but neither one nor t'other can pretend to any earlier author for it than <HI>Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P>NOR do the SCRIPTURES know any more of this doctrine than the <HI>Fathers</HI> do. Indeed the &s;criptures teach us, that <HI>in God we live and move, Acts</HI> 17.28. But this can't intend, that God <HI>excites</HI> and <HI>determines</HI> all our motions; for that would make <HI>Him</HI> much more the author of the wor&s;t of our actions, than <HI>we</HI> our&s;elves are: And therefore the meaning can only be, that as God at fir&s;t gives us a power of mov|ing, &s;o he continually &s;upports and pre&s;erves that power in all its exerci&s;es.</P>

<P>A MAN hath from God the powers belong|ing to his nature, by which he is capable of loving or hating any apprehended good or evil. The&s;e powers being by a pre&s;ent divine influ|ence rendered habile, and apt for action, he can now love a good name, health, ea&s;e, life; and hate di&s;grace, &s;ickne&s;s, pain, death; but he does al&s;o by the&s;e powers thus habilitated for action, love wickedne&s;s and hate God.

<P>THUS the <HI>Sublap&s;arians,</HI> while with the <HI>Ar|minians</HI> they utterly deny any <HI>determinative</HI> di|vine influence to evil actions, do at the &s;ame time with the <HI>Supralap&s;arians</HI> earne&s;tly maintain the <HI>efficacy</HI> of divine grace, whenever God plea|&s;es, and the nece&s;&s;ity of its influence in order to our being and doing good.

<P><PB N="37" REF="009541_0036_0F768BE26501C140">TO conclude, by maintaining always the nece&s;&s;ity, and whenever God plea&s;es, the <HI>effi|cacy of his grace,</HI> and denying a <HI>determinative</HI> influence to evil actions, the <HI>Sublap&s;arians</HI> ap|prehend they avoid the difficulties with which both the other &s;chemes are pre&s;&s;ed, by main|taining both, or denying both.</P>
<P>BUT I proceed to &s;ay, that in con&s;equence of the <HI>Sublap&s;arians</HI> denying that men are ef|ficaciou&s;ly determined by God to all their ac|tions, even tho&s;e which have &s;in in&s;eparably annexed to them, they are obliged to maintain,</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT God foreknows what rational a|gents will do, <HI>when he thinks fit to leave them entirely to the freedom of their own wills, without interpo&s;ing his own power to determine them one way or the other.</HI> This principle nece&s;&s;arily follows from the former; for if God does not determine men to their &s;inful actions, he mu&s;t either foreknow what they will do, when he don't determine them, or el&s;e he mu&s;t be ig|norant beforehand of a great part of the ac|tions of mankind.</P>
<P>'TIS true it is not ea&s;y to &s;hew how tho&s;e future contingencies, which depend upon the free choice of the will, &s;hould be certain and in|fallible; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burnet</HI>'s Expo&s;ition, p. 158.</NOTE> but we are from &s;ufficient evidence per&s;waded that it is &s;o. For we &s;ee thro' the whole &s;criptures a thread of very po&s;itive prophe&s;ies, the accompli&s;hment whereof de|pended on the free will of men; and the&s;e predictions, as they were made very preci&s;ely,
<PB N="38" REF="009541_0037_0F768BE351738F50">
&s;o they were no le&s;s punctually accompli&s;hed. Not to mention any other prophe&s;ies, all tho&s;e which relate to the death and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, were fulfilled by the <HI>free acts</HI> of the prie&s;ts and people of the <HI>Jews:</HI> They &s;inned in doing it, which proves that they acted in it with their natural liberty. By the&s;e, and all the other prophe&s;ies, which are in both te&s;ta|ments, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the&s;e things were certainly foreknown, but where to found that certainty, cannot ea&s;ily be re&s;olved. Nor is it of any importance, whether we can re|&s;olve it, or no. The infinite perfection of the divine mind ought here to &s;ilence all objections. A clear idea by which we apprehend a thing to be plainly contrary to the attributes of God, is indeed &s;ufficient ground to reject it. And therefore they think they are in the right to deny that God efficaciou&s;ly determines men to &s;inful actions, becau&s;e they apprehend it to be plainly contrary to ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s and holine&s;s: But if the objection again&s;t any thing &s;uppo&s;ed to be in God, lies only again&s;t the manner, and the unconceivablene&s;s of it, there the infinite perfection of God an&s;wers all.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Howe,</HI> Vol. II. p. 504.</NOTE> It cannot therefore be &s;o frightful a thing, to &s;up|po&s;e God's foreknowledge of the mo&s;t contin|gent future actions, well to con&s;i&s;t with our ignorance how he foreknows them; as that we &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary to over turn and mingle heaven and earth, rather than admit it.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="009541_0038_0F768BE3CF71B470">IT is further to be con&s;idered, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burnet</HI>'s Expo&s;ition, p. 159.</NOTE> that this pre&s;cience does not make the effects certain, becau&s;e they are fore&s;een; but they are fore|&s;een becau&s;e that they are to be: So that the certainty of the pre&s;cience is not antecedent or cau&s;al, but &s;ub&s;equent and eventual.&mdash; What&s;oever happens was future before it hap|pened; and &s;ince it happened, it was certain|ly future from all eternity; not by a certainty of fate; but by a certainty which ari&s;es out of its being once; from which this truth, that it was future, was eternally certain: Therefore the divine pre&s;cience being only the knowing all things which were to come, it does not in|fer a nece&s;&s;ity of cau&s;ality.</P>
<P>THE &s;cripture plainly &s;hews on &s;ome occa|&s;ions <HI>a conditionate pre&s;cience,</HI> as in the ca&s;e of the men of <HI>Keilah,</HI> of <HI>Tire and Sidan, Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah.</HI> Since then this pre&s;cience may be &s;o certain, that it never can be mi&s;taken, nor mi&s;guide the de&s;igns and providence of God; and &s;ince by this, both the attributes of God are vindicated, and the undetermined freedom of the will of man to &s;in is a&s;&s;erted, all diffi|culties &s;eem to be ea&s;ily cleared this way.</P>
<P>THEY further add, that God having made man a free creature, his governing him accor|dingly, and making his own admini&s;tration of the world &s;uitable to it, is no diminution of his own authority; it is only carrying on of his own creation, according to the &s;everal natures which he hath put in that variety of beings,
<PB N="40" REF="009541_0039_0F768BE56141A818">
of which this world is compo&s;ed, and with which it is diver&s;ified. Therefore if &s;ome of the acts of God, with relation to man, are not &s;o ab&s;olute as his other acts are, and as the <HI>Supralap&s;arians</HI> &s;uppo&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to the ul|timate perfection of an independent being; this ari&s;es not from any defect in the acts of God; but becau&s;e the nature of the creature, which he intended to make free, is incon&s;i&s;|tent with &s;uch acts.</P>
<P>THE divine omnipotence is not le&s;&s;ened when we ob&s;erve &s;ome of God's works to be more beautiful and u&s;eful than others are: And the irregular productions of nature do not derogate from the order in which all things appear lovely to the divine mind. So if that liberty with which God intended to endue thinking beings, is incompatible with &s;uch po&s;itive acts, and &s;o po&s;itive a providence as governs natural things, and this material world; then this is no way derogatory to the &s;overeign|ty of his mind. This al&s;o gives &s;uch an account of the evil which is in the world, as does no way accu&s;e or le&s;&s;en the purity and holine&s;s of God: Since he only &s;uffers his creatures to go on in the free u&s;e of the powers which he hath given them; about which he exerci&s;es a &s;pe|cial providence, making &s;ome men's &s;ins to be the immediate puni&s;hment of their own, or of other men's &s;ins; and re&s;training them often in a great deal of that evil which they do de&s;ign, and bringing out of it a great deal of good,

For the <HI>Supralap&s;arians</HI> them&s;elves don't &s;uppo&s;e the decree to be the cau&s;e of the futurition of any thing, but what God in con&s;equence of his decree, <HI>efficaciou&s;ly determines</HI> his creatures to, in the cour&s;e of his providence.</P>
<P>IN a word, both <HI>Supra</HI> and <HI>Sublap&s;arians</HI> are agreed, to di&s;tingui&s;h the decrees of God into <HI>effective</HI> and <HI>permi&s;&s;ive.</HI> The <HI>effective</HI> decree (&s;ay the <HI>Sublap&s;arians</HI>) puts a certain futurition
<PB N="43" REF="009541_0042_0F768BE7A758B160">
into things; but the <HI>permi&s;&s;ive</HI> does not &s;o. The <HI>effective</HI> decree may re&s;pect both <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral good;</HI> the <HI>permi&s;&s;ive</HI> decree principally re|gards <HI>moral evil,</HI> which God does not, either immediately or mediately, <HI>effect</HI> by his own power; but only <HI>permits</HI> to the power of his creatures: having thought fit, for wi&s;e rea&s;ons, not always to hinder them (tho' many times he does) from abu&s;ing the powers he hath gi|ven them for better purpo&s;es, to the com|mi&s;&s;ion of it.&mdash;This di&s;tinction between an <HI>ef|fective</HI> and <HI>permi&s;&s;ive</HI> decree, they think, is ren|dered <HI>a di&s;tinction without a difference,</HI> by the <HI>Su|pralap&s;arian</HI> doctrines of <HI>efficacious permi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>predeterminative concour&s;e</HI> to actions intrin&s;i|cally evil; that God does by an efficacious power and influence move and predetermine men unto all their actions, even to &s;uch as have &s;in in&s;eparably annexed to them; that he does &s;ecretly, but effectually, incline and apply the wills of men to the entative acts of &s;uch things. For if the&s;e doctrines be true, the <HI>Sub|lap&s;arians</HI> think it will follow, that all the de|crees of God are <HI>alike ab&s;olute and effective.</HI> Not to repeat here, that they think the&s;e doctrines to be founded upon <HI>fal&s;e principles,</HI> and to be nece&s;&s;arily attended with <HI>con&s;equences too &s;hock|ing to be endured;</HI> their rea&s;ons for both which I have given before.</P>
<P N="4">4. THEY <HI>maintain, that the ordaining of cer|tain men from eternity to condemnation was upon a fore&s;ight of their ungodline&s;s and infidelity; tho'
<PB N="44" REF="009541_0043_0F768BE84FDF00E8">
on the other hand, they deny that any were elected to everla&s;ting life, upon a fore&s;ight of their faith and obedience.</HI> The&s;e two things they appre|hend in their own nature to &s;tand upon as dif|ferent a foo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> as po&s;&s;ible; and to be every-where &s;o repre&s;ented in the &s;criptures. They think the &s;criptures all along repre&s;ent the de&s;truction of man to be of him&s;elf; and never intimate his being determined by divine influence to a|ny evil action. And they think it clear from &s;cripture, that God knows what men will do, when left entirely to the freedom of their own wills: from whence they conclude, that God fore&s;aw the apo&s;ta&s;y of man, if left to the free|dom of his own will, and thought fit &s;o to leave him; and that he fore&s;aw the corruption which would follow upon the apo&s;ta&s;y, that the wickedne&s;s of man would be great in the earth, and every imagination of the tho'ts of his heart evil, and determin'd not to hinder it: but ordained certain men to that condem|nation, which he fore&s;aw they would de&s;erve by their &s;ins.</P>
<P>WHEREAS of his meer good plea&s;ure he elected others, whom he fore&s;aw would be alike involv'd in &s;in and guilt, to eternal life; and entered into a covenant of grace, to deliver them out of that &s;tate of &s;in and mi|&s;ery, and to bring them into a &s;tate of &s;alvation by a redeemer. Now forasmuch as they who are thus elected to everla&s;ting life, are &s;uppo|&s;ed to be really involved in &s;in and guilt with
<PB N="45" REF="009541_0044_0F768BE9197C75B8">
the re&s;t; and forasmuch as the &s;criptures re|pre&s;ent eternal life it&s;elf, and all the things which <HI>immediately</HI> qualify and prepare men for it, &s;uch as <HI>faith, repentance</HI> and <HI>new obedi|ence,</HI> to be not of men them&s;elves, but the Gifts of God: therefore the <HI>Sublap&s;arians</HI> think it impo&s;&s;ible that any &s;hould be elected to ever|la&s;ting life, upon a fore&s;ight of their faith and o|bedience. For (&s;ay they) men cannot be e|lected upon a fore&s;ight of tho&s;e things, which they would never have, if God had not tho't fit of his good plea&s;ure to be&s;tow them on them. So that while the <HI>Sublap&s;arians</HI> maintain, that certain men are ordained to condemnation up|on a fore&s;ight of their wickedne&s;s and unbelief, they at the &s;ame time re&s;olve the election of o|thers principally into the good plea&s;ure of the divine will. And in keeping this middle-way, they think they both follow the guidance of the &s;criptures, which always teach us to arro|gate no good to our&s;elves, and do impute no moral evil to God; and that they al&s;o &s;ecure the honor of all the divine attributes. For, on the one hand, no man can rea&s;onably complain, either that he is left to the freedom of his own will, or that he is ordained to &s;uch condemna|tion, as God fore&s;aw he would de&s;erve, by his abu&s;e of that freedom. Nor ought any man's eye to be evil, becau&s;e God's eye is good. For may he not do what he plea&s;es with his own? And, if he thinks fit, may he not be&s;tow <HI>that</HI> grace and favor upon &s;ome, which none de|&s;erve,
<PB N="46" REF="009541_0045_0F768BE9D5330C38">
and which he might ju&s;tly have with|held from all?&mdash;And again, on the other hand, what man can glory in the pre&s;ence of the Lord, when the great things in which he is not as other men, are not of him&s;elf; but are the gifts of God?</P>
<P>BUT I proceed to &s;ay in the la&s;t place, that tho' the <HI>Sublap&s;arians</HI> hold, that God hath or|dained certain men to condemnation upon a fore&s;ight of their ungodline&s;s and infidelity, yet they maintain,</P>
<P N="5">5. THAT <HI>ungodline&s;s and infidelity fore&s;een are not the proper cau&s;es, but only the antecedent conditions of reprobation.</HI> Thus the celebrated <HI>Turrettine</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p 422</NOTE> repre&s;ents their &s;entiments, <HI>Si ob&s;olut&egrave; con&s;ideratur reprobatio rect&egrave; ad&s;cribitur corruptioni hominis nativae, quae eum effecit ju&s;t&egrave; reprobabilem: &s;i ver&ograve; comparat&egrave;, ad &s;olum Dei beneplacitum,</HI> &amp;c. <Q>If (&s;ays he) Reprobation be con&s;idered <HI>ab&s;olutely,</HI> it is ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to man's native corruption, which hath rendered him a proper object of it; but if it be con&s;idered <HI>comparatively,</HI> it mu&s;t be re|&s;olved entirely into the good plea&s;ure of God, who according to his &s;overeign right and freedom, choo&s;es whom he will and pa&s;&s;es by the re&s;t. If therefore it be enqui|red, <HI>why this, or the other man was reprobated?</HI> The an&s;wer is, <HI>Becau&s;e God fore&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> that he would de&s;erve it by his &s;ins.</HI> Not that &s;in is properly the cau&s;e of reprobation, for then
<PB N="47" REF="009541_0046_0F768BEA8FFB4348">
all mu&s;t have been reprobated, who were alike &s;inners; but it is a condition or antecedent quality, by which a man becomes a proper object of reprobation: Or it is a cau&s;e <HI>&s;ine qua non;</HI> for if a man had not been a &s;inner, he had not been reprobated of God; tho' every one be not nece&s;&s;arily reprobated, who is a &s;inner. But when the enquiry is, <HI>why God hath reprobated this man, rather than the other,</HI> when they were both equally &s;inners, and &s;o alike proper objects of reprobation? <HI>Here &s;in cannot be alledged,</HI> becau&s;e it is com|mon to them both; and what is common to them both, cannot (&s;o far as we can &s;ee) cau&s;e a difference to be made between the one and the other.</Q> And therefore no rea&s;on can be rendered by us for it in many ca&s;es, be&s;ides the mere &s;overeign plea&s;ure of God, <HI>even &s;o Father, for &s;o it hath &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight.</HI> I &s;ay in many ca&s;es, becau&s;e it appears in fact from many in&s;tances, that &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;eemed to men the mo&s;t unlikely, neverthele&s;s belonged to the election of grace. For there have been not a few In&s;tances of very profligate &s;inners, who like <HI>Mana&s;&s;ah have wrought much evil in the &s;ight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger;</HI> and yet, thro' the mercy and grace of God, have been &s;topped in their carreer, to their own de&s;truction, and made to all appearance, &s;incere penitents, and &s;ound believers.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="009541_0047_0F768BEC1088AA80" MS="y">AND yet all this don't hinder, but that far the bigger part of tho&s;e who attain the mercy of God unto eternal life, may have been cho&s;en to it, upon a fore&s;ight not of their faith and repentance, but of their diligent improvement of the means of grace, and earne&s;t prayer for the aids of God's holy Spirit.
