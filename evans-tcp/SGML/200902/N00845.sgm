<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot be more concerned than I am at the frequency of your &s;ervice in <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> &s;ince I am very &s;en&s;ible of the Trouble and <HI>Charge</HI> it Contracts upon the Country: But the Motives being con&s;idered, and that <HI>You</HI> mu&s;t have met of Cour&s;e in the next <HI>Month,</HI> I hope you will not think it a Hard&s;hip now. The rea&s;ons that ha&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">n your Se&s;&s;ions, is the Nece&s;&s;ity I am under, through the Endeavours of the E|nemies of the PROSPERITY of this <HI>Country,</HI> to go for ENGLAND; where taking Advantage of my Ab&s;ence, &s;ome have attempted, by fal&s;e or unrea|&s;onable Charges, to <HI>undermine</HI> our <HI>Government,</HI> and thereby the true va|lue of our <HI>Labours</HI> and <HI>Property, Government</HI> having been our fir&s;t Encoura|gement. I Confe&s;s I cannot think of &s;uch a <HI>Voyage</HI> without great Reluc|tancy of mind, having promi&s;ed my &s;elf the quietne&s;s of a <HI>Wilderne&s;s,</HI> and that I might &s;tay &s;o long at lea&s;t with you, as to render every Body in|tirely ea&s;ie and &s;afe: For my <HI>Heart</HI> is among you as well as my <HI>body,</HI> what ever &s;ome people may plea&s;e to think: and no <HI>unkindne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>di&s;appoint|ment</HI> &s;hall (with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God's <HI>Providence</HI>) ever be able to alter my <HI>Love</HI> to the <HI>Country,</HI> and Re&s;olution to return and &s;ettle my Family and Po&s;terity in it; but having rea&s;on to believe I can at this time be&s;t &s;erve <HI>you</HI> and <HI>my&s;elf</HI> on that &s;ide of the Water, neither the rudene&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on nor Tender Circum&s;tances of my <HI>Family</HI> can over-rule my Inclinations to undertake it.</P>
<P>Think therefore, (&s;ince all men are <HI>Mortal</HI>) of &s;ome &s;uitable Expedient and Provi&s;ion for your Safety, as well in your <HI>Priviledges</HI> as <HI>Property,</HI> and you will find me ready to Comply with what&s;oever may render us happy by a nearer Union of our Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Review again your <HI>Laws,</HI> propo&s;e New ones that may better your Circum&s;tances; and what you do, do it quickly, remembring that the <HI>Parlia|ment</HI> &s;its the end of the next <HI>Month,</HI> and that the &s;ooner I am there, the &s;afer I hope we &s;hall be here.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t recommend to your Serious Thoughts &amp; Care the <HI>Kings</HI> Letter to me, for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>New-York,</HI> with <HI>Three-hundred</HI> and <HI>Fifty pounds Sterling,</HI> as a Frontier <HI>Government,</HI> and therefore Expo&s;ed to a much greater expence in proportion to other <HI>Colonies;</HI> which I call'd the la&s;t <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> to
<PB REF="001017_0002_0FAEEDE1598F9440">take into their Con&s;ideration, and they were plea&s;ed for the rea&s;ons then given, to refer to this</P>
<P>I am al&s;o to tell you the good News of the <HI>Governour</HI> of <HI>New-York,</HI> his happy I&s;&s;ue of his Conferences with the five Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> that he hath not only made Peace with them, for the <HI>Kings</HI> Subjects of that <HI>Colony,</HI> but (as I had by &s;ome Letters before <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">m) for tho&s;e of all other <HI>Governments</HI> under the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of <HI>England</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of <HI>America,</HI> as al&s;o the <HI>Nations</HI> of <HI>Indians</HI> within tho&s;e Re&s;pective <HI>Colonies,</HI> which cer|tainly Merits our Acknowledgements.</P>
<P>I have done, when I have told you, that Unanimity and Di&s;patch are the Life of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and that I de&s;ire and expect from you, for your own &s;akes, &s;ince it may &s;o much Contribute to the Di&s;appointment of tho&s;e, that too long have &s;ought the Ruine of our Young <HI>Country.</HI></P>
