<OPENER><SALUTE>ESTEEMED FRIEND.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE de&s;ire thou intimated&s;t to me, to &s;ee &s;omething written by one of the &s;o|ciety of friends, in favor of the exemption from military &s;ervice, which we, from religi|ous motives, feel it our duty to adhere to, and upon principles of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> right, to expect will not be denied us, in the United-States of America; and the &s;atisfaction I derive from conferring with thee on &s;ubjects of &s;erious import, prompt me to addre&s;s thee at this time.</P>
<P>To do ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject, is what I do not pretend; nor &s;hall I enter into a con&s;ide|ration of the &s;oundne&s;s or fallacy of the rea|&s;ons, which dictate to us, the ob&s;ervance of this conduct&mdash;Theological controver&s;y, or an attempt to confute the religious tenets of any &s;ect, is, in my opinion, improper. Let
<PB N="4" REF="028967_0004_0FDDC65D49B1A8B0">
every one have free acce&s;s to every &s;ource of human information in religious concerns, of which mankind is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and practi&s;e with|out controul, tho&s;e precepts, which he be|lieves it is his duty to ob&s;erve. If this be conceded, it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that it would be equally improper for me, to in&s;i&s;t upon the orthodoxy of a practice, which thy &s;en&s;e of religious obligation does not enjoin thee to, in order to convince thee of the expedi|ence of leaving me to the exerci&s;e of it.</P>
<P>It is not, therefore, upon the ground of our &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s, in this re&s;pect, being well founded, that we require to be exempted, (though it be the real one for our refu&s;ing to do military &s;ervice,) but, upon the ground of unre&s;trained FREEDOM of OPINIONS, which is the BIRTH-RIGHT&mdash;the CON|STITUTIONAL RIGHT of EVERY CITIZEN of THESE STATES, whether in re|ligious or other concerns: to enjoy which, was the leading object of the grant for the territory of Penn&s;ylvania being obtained from Charles the &s;econd, by William Penn, under who&s;e au&s;pices, our ance&s;tors migrated thither, and fir&s;t began to feel the ble&s;&s;ings which their inoffen&s;ivene&s;s, and mortal and religious ha|bits were &s;uited to afford them, under the benign influence of religious liberty&mdash;ble&s;&s;ings, in the enjoyment of which we were (though a Briti&s;h colony) up to the late revolution in America.&mdash;And will the citizens of this new born nation, place us in a wor&s;e &s;ituation than we were before, and debar us from con|tinuing
<PB N="5" REF="028967_0005_0FDDC663B7C71D20">
to enjoy them? Would it be con|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit which actuated them to undertake, and in accompli&s;hing that revo|lution? Every one who has learnt the politi|cal creed of 1774, knows that it would not.&mdash;The con&s;titution of the union, which is in|tended to &s;ecure to the citizens, as well qua|kers, as others, tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, which they acquired by the revolution, declares that it is not: "Congre&s;s &s;hall make no law re&s;pecting an e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion, or PROHIBIT|ING THE FREE EXERCISE THEREOF."</P>
<P>I am aware, that it has been tauntingly ob|&s;erved by &s;ome, that it is from the impul&s;e of fear and cowardice, and not from a &s;en&s;e of religious duty, that we de&s;ert the &s;cenes of human blood&s;hed, and renounce the laurels which adorn the hero. This ob&s;ervation, however, I am per&s;uaded, obtains belief with few, if any, who have had an opportunity of a&s;&s;ociating with many of the &s;ociety of friends; and tho&s;e who have never had &s;uch an oppor|tunity, are incompetent judges of the truth of the ob&s;ervation:&mdash;The ardor of youth, ambition, and other powerful &s;prings, which exi&s;t in the human brea&s;t, it may be rea&s;on|ably &s;uppo&s;ed, are common to the members of our, as well as to tho&s;e of every other &s;ociety; but it is the early and a&s;&s;iduous care, which is be&s;towed upon the formation of our minds, and the direction of our ideas, which fir&s;t initiates us into the habit of re&s;training our ambition, and other pa&s;&s;ions; and finally deters us from engaging in the field of battle:
<PB N="6" REF="028967_0006_0FDDC6675A1D2670">
and permit me to add, that true bravery as a&s;&s;uredly exi&s;ts, where fortitude and human|ity re&s;ide, as that, the man who can re&s;train the force of his pa&s;&s;ions, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no &s;mall &s;hare of tho&s;e qualities.</P>
<P>The effects of con&s;cientious &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s upon a religious mind, can not be better ex|emplified, than they were in William Penn:&mdash;the &s;acrifices, which were made by him, in the &s;pring of his life, can not be accounted for, upon any other ground, than that of a religious &s;en&s;e of duty; unle&s;s they be attri|buted to an eccentricity of mind, or a dere|liction of his &s;en&s;es: cau&s;es, to which the uni|formity of his &s;ub&s;equent conduct, the con|&s;i&s;tency and &s;ucce&s;s which di&s;tingui&s;hed his arduous and philanthoropic enterpri&s;es and writings, and (if I may be allowed to add) the patronage of his &s;overeign, unite to for|bid is from a&s;cribing the great and de&s;erved re&s;pect and fame, which wait upon, and per|petuate his memory.</P>
<P>And yet &s;ome of tho&s;e very precepts of this great and worthy chri&s;tian, have been occa&s;ionally the &s;port of many, and the cau&s;e of much &s;uffering and di&s;tre&s;s to individuals of the &s;ociety, impo&s;ed on them too, by par|liamentary authority; until they have &s;unk their profe&s;&s;ors below the level of public ven|geance, or private &s;corn; and again have ac|quired to them, the re&s;pect and e&s;teem of mo&s;t, and been adopted by many.</P>
<P>The &s;cruples of friends are &s;everal, and it may &s;erve to evince the materiality in which
<PB N="7" REF="028967_0007_0FDDC668A34E5098">
we hold an ob&s;ervance of them, to enquire whether we relaxed or grew le&s;s tenacious in adhering to them, either from the &s;ufferings to which they &s;ubjected us, or from the pro|gre&s;&s;ive elap&s;e of time.</P>
<P>One of them re&s;pects the conforming to the taking an oath. Friends hold the truth obligatory on them always, and that the true intention of a corporal or external ceremony, preparatory to &s;peaking it on occa&s;ions of mo|ment; is to make the per&s;on, by &s;olemnly un|dertaking to adhere to it, in any particular, liable to incur the legal penalties, which await a violation of it, in that particular: but we refu&s;e to impart &s;olemnity to a ceremony of that kind, as frequently practi&s;ed, by making an appeal to, and u&s;e of the name of the Dei|ty: from a conviction, that to do &s;o, is profane, and repugnant to the text, which enjoins to "&s;wear not at all;" though we object not to an innocent form of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to be puni&s;hed, if we violate the truth. This form I need not tell thee, is by oral affirmation; for which we were per&s;ecuted under the &s;tatute of 13 &amp; 14 C. II. Ch. 1. and by the magi&s;tracy of that time, in a manner which is equally di&s;grace|ful to the government of England, and officers under it. Although branded with infamy, for refu&s;ing the oaths of allegiance, &s;upremacy and abjuration, and &s;ubjected to lingering con|finements, loath&s;ome pri&s;ons, without nece&s;|&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or the communion of friends or relatives, under pretext that our refu&s;al proceeded from di&s;affection to the royal family,
<PB N="8" REF="028967_0008_0FDDC66A053BB8C0">
to the renunciation of papal authority, and to the government of Great Britain, yet the &s;teady and inflexible per&s;everance of the &s;ociety, in not complying, &s;urmounted and &s;ur|vived parliamentary oppo&s;ition, and magi&s;terial tyranny.</P>
<P>After the &s;ociety were expo&s;ed to and expe|rienced the&s;e evils during many years, for &s;uppo&s;ed criminality, re&s;ulting from the mi&s;|take, perhaps intentional, on the part of go|vernment, of attributing the con&s;cientious &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s of the quaker, to the di&s;loy|alty of the &s;ubject, they were mitigated by the act of 8 G. I. Ch. 6: the effects of which however were but little felt in the courts of ju&s;tice in England, until the 22. G. II. Ch. 46 &sect; 36. To this day, in that country, a quaker is not admitted to affirm in criminal ca&s;es, to &s;erve on juries, or bear any office of profit under government.</P>
<P>Friends &s;crupled al&s;o to pay tithes, rates, or other payments, for the &s;tipend or main|tenance of hireling mini&s;ters or curates; on which account, in England, the &s;ociety have laboured under much impo&s;ition, from the mode in which they are di&s;trained for, and collected. The annual amounts of the&s;e are &s;et forth, in the epi&s;tles from the yearly-meet|ings of friends, and amount to a far greater tax than they would do, were they paid vo|luntarily; notwith&s;tanding which, the pay|ment of them is refu&s;ed to this day.</P>
<P>Thus, the government of England im|po&s;ed upon the quakers, penalties for di&s;&s;ent|ing
<PB N="9" REF="028967_0009_0FDDC66D2191F6B0">
from the regulations and doctrines of its church, as &s;oon as the &s;ociety made its appear|ance, which was about the re&s;toration; at the &s;ame time, that the &s;ame government were exerci&s;ing the like di&s;cretion or privi|lege, in denying the dogmas of the church of Rome, and re&s;i&s;ting the papal authority, which they had, for between eight and nine centu|ries, before acknowledged and &s;ubmitted to.</P>
<P>In America, our &s;ociety is relieved from the grievances to which it is &s;ubjected in Great Britain, in the&s;e re&s;pects&mdash;nor do I &s;ee why re|ligious liberty &s;hould be limitted to the&s;e pri|vileges only&mdash;it is to be hoped, and rea&s;ona|bly to be expected, that we &s;hall not be com|pelled to &s;uffer &s;o much in America, before we attain to the enjoyment of the &s;ame &s;hare of di&s;cretion in carrying arms, as we &s;uffered in England on account of our &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s to &s;wear, and to contribute to the mainte|tenace of the mini&s;ters of other religious &s;ocie|ties; that arbitrary acts of congre&s;s will not be pa&s;&s;ed in imitation of the &s;tatute of Charles II. to take away the freedom of the mind in re|ligious concerns, whil&s;t the liberty of politi|cal opinions, which are more apt to affect the harmony of &s;ocial compacts, be pre&s;erved in|violate and unlimited.</P>
<P>The du&s;t of time, would never hide the &s;tain which &s;uch a mea&s;ure would throw upon the national character of this country&mdash;it has tarni&s;hed, and will tarni&s;h for ever the lu&s;tre with which Great Britain once excelled eve|ry contending rival; though it may be remem|bered,
<PB N="10" REF="028967_0010_0FDDC66E951195D0">
that the &s;tatute of Charles originated whil&s;t, and where witchcraft and &s;orcery, in|chantment and conjuration, were &s;eriou&s;ly pro|hibited, and &s;everely puni&s;hed, by legi&s;lative interference&mdash;but, as the minds of men are more enlarged and enlightened by the progre&s;s of &s;cience, experience and civilization, the opinions, and tenets, and, it is to be hoped, the &s;cruples of each other become more and more generally re&s;pected, though more vari|ant and divers; as the clouds of &s;uper&s;tition pa&s;s from over the heads of the majority of the people, the&s;e phantoms of ignorance va|ni&s;h from their minds, and the rigor of pe|nalties, inflicted upon difference in opinions, is moderated and done away&mdash;the illiberal and prejudiced &s;tate, in which minds &s;o bewil|dered mu&s;t have been, is the be&s;t excu&s;e that can be made, for the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit with which they pur&s;ued the few who dared to di&s;&s;ent from the generally received opinions of the nation, an excu&s;e, however, which could never be offered for the imitation of &s;uch an example in this country.</P>
<P>That the infliction of fines, or other pu|ni&s;hments, would be as ineffectual in reccon|ciling quakers in America, to carry arms, as they proved in prevailing upon them in En|gland to make oath; there is no rea&s;on to doubt.</P>
<P>It is therefore, with much unea&s;ine&s;s, that I learn from the 17th clau&s;e of the militia bill, which is po&s;tponed until the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of congre&s;s, that &s;uch citizens as are con&s;ci|entiou&s;ly
<PB N="11" REF="028967_0011_0FDDC67018588B40">
&s;crupulous of bearing arms, are to be exempted from doing &s;o, upon paying a fine&mdash;to pay a fine, in lieu of bearing arms, would be as repugnant to the principles of friends, as the performance of the &s;ervice, from which it were to exempt them; and for rea&s;ons &s;ynonymous to tho&s;e, which deter them from contributing to the &s;upport and maintenance of hireling mini&s;ters&mdash;to collect the&s;e fines, therefore, the &s;ubordinate magi&s;|tracy of the country mu&s;t interpo&s;e their authority, which will put it in their power (and their inclination to exerci&s;e it in general can|not be denied) to impo&s;e upon and di&s;tre&s;s the unfortunate victims of their rapacity, to a-degree far beyond every benefit, which the country could derive from &s;uch a &s;ource of revenue. The mole&s;tation and di&s;turbance of that cla&s;s of the citizens, denominated qua|kers, which con&s;titutes too, in &s;ome places, the more con&s;iderable part, would, as well as be unju&s;t and uncon&s;titutional in it&s;elf, &s;erve to interrupt the harmony, and to de&s;troy the whole&s;ome effect, which the decorous and ju|dicious di&s;cipline and regulations of that &s;ocie|ty, are calculated to produce to every cla&s;s of a community; and which candor cannot but acknowledge, are di&s;tingui&s;hed excellencies in the pacific department of municipal &s;cience. The advantages which the community derive from the&s;e, would be felt no more: and the amount of the fines, after being extorted, would not compen&s;ate the lo&s;s of them. It is a maxim, that the law ought not to require
<PB N="12" REF="028967_0012_0FDDC6718A4EDAE0">
impo&s;&s;ibilities; and it is the language of rea|&s;on, and religion, that a man &s;hould not be forced to wrong his own con&s;cience: and a quaker mu&s;t either do the latter, or be inca|pable of complying with the requi&s;ites of this clau&s;e of the bill&mdash;it would be tantamount to the taxing the opinions of one cla&s;s of the citizens, in exclu&s;ion of every other. To tax a man for not doing a particular &s;ervice, which his <HI>con&s;cience</HI> forbids <HI>him</HI> to do, in or|der to make up for that omi&s;&s;ion, is as un|rea&s;onable, as it would be to extra-tax the members of a community, who po&s;&s;e&s;s one kind of property, to make their contribution equivalent to that, which the public coffers receive from tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s another kind of property.</P>
<P>Why then &s;hould friends be prohibited the exemption from military &s;ervice which they claim? Let us proceed to enquire into &s;ome of the rea&s;ons which are a&s;&s;igned again&s;t it.</P>
<P>One of them, and which is &s;aid to di&s;play the ab&s;urdity of the claim, is, that if &s;uch a &s;cruple were to prevail in the brea&s;ts of a large majority of a nation, &s;elf defence mu&s;t be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and the nation &s;ubmit to the inju&s;tice and will of their invaders.</P>
<P>I might &s;afely admit the rea&s;on, &s;o far as it is applicable to this &s;ubject, without receiving any injury from its force&mdash;for, though a ma|jority of the people view a religious tenet as ridiculous or ab&s;urd, yet the voice of the ma|jority cannot, con&s;i&s;tent with the federal con|&s;titution, forbid the exerci&s;e of it: otherwi&s;e,
<PB N="13" REF="028967_0013_0FDD5F75313559E0">
a majority would e&s;tabli&s;h a national religion. But I think no &s;uch ab&s;urdity is apparent, and without &s;oliciting thy acquie&s;cence in my rea&s;ons for thinking &s;o, I will barely &s;tate them.</P>
<P>Let me fir&s;t take the objection, upon the large&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;cale; and &s;uppo&s;e the princi|ple of friends in this re&s;pect, to be ob&s;erved by every nation in the world&mdash;in this point of view, the objection vani&s;hes. The energy of the principle, it&s;elf, becomes the bulwark of &s;elf-defence&mdash;no violence would be offered to the rights of each other, to require oppo&s;ition; but this mode of rea&s;oning, however ju&s;t, were mankind as they ought to be, regardful of the rights of one another, is objectionable on ac|count of the inapplicability of it, to the actu|al &s;tate in which mankind are&mdash;then, the que&s;tion re&s;ults to this: viewing the &s;tates of human &s;ocieties, as they really exi&s;t, might the inva&s;ions of the rights of nations or &s;tates, which take place, be prevented or adju&s;ted without having recour&s;e to arms? For and again&s;t this que&s;tion, much metaphy&s;ical and theoretic rea&s;oning might be adduced&mdash;but as thy own ingenuity may &s;ugge&s;t, and thy own judgment decide upon it, perhaps as well without, as with many comments of mine, I &s;hall do little more than recur to the te&s;t of ex|perience for the &s;olution of the query.</P>
<P>Experience teaches, that man can effect more by the powers of his mind, than he can by tho&s;e of his body. The latter, form the fir&s;t and chief dependence of man, in a &s;tate of nature, as well to &s;upport, as to protect and defend
<PB N="14" REF="028967_0014_0FDDC677DEA48B20">
him&s;elf. But, they barely enable the &s;avage to obtain a &s;canty nouri&s;hment for his body, whil&s;t the citizen, by the former, is put into the full enjoyment, of not only the nece&s;&s;a|ries, but all the elegancies and luxuries of life. However, to protect and defend our&s;elves, in the enjoyment of the&s;e advantages, we &s;eem to remain in a natural &s;tate, re&s;orting to vio|lence and oppre&s;&s;ion again&s;t the invader; ad|hering to the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem, which man, in a barbarous and rude &s;tate, is impelled to ob&s;erve, for the purpo&s;es of ab&s;tract &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. Little doubt exi&s;ts with me, but that an al|ternative may always be found out, if as much ingenuity were expended for the purpo&s;e, as there u&s;ually is to excel in arts of cruelty; and which might be as &s;uperior to the u&s;e of arms, as the civilized pur&s;uits of agriculture, commerce, and navigation, are to the robu&s;t toils of the chace, for the acquirement of the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life.</P>
<P>It is incon&s;i&s;tent with chri&s;tianity to re&s;ort to arms&mdash;one crime will not ju&s;tify another. The <HI>lex talionis</HI> is not a part of the chri&s;tian religion, and the u&s;ing of arms, to re&s;i&s;t an attack, is returning violence for violence, and oppo&s;ing force with force; involving our|&s;elves in the like criminality; and making our&s;elves as de&s;erving of cha&s;ti&s;ement as they are on whom we inflict it, for imitating the evil example which incurs our di&s;plea&s;ure. Even, if in this in&s;tance, the rules of religion were incon&s;i&s;tent with the exigency of the occa&s;ion, the latter ought to &s;ubmit to the
<PB N="15" REF="028967_0015_0FDDC6790F5D0B60">
former; but &s;uch an exigency cannot exi&s;t, for it were to create a dilemma in the mind of a chri&s;tian, to render it <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for him to <HI>do</HI> that, which it is his <HI>duty not</HI> to do&mdash;in|deed, I think, this has teen fairly tried and evinced, in the &s;ettlement of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>That country was inhabited by, and in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the aborigines, at the time that William Penn landed there. They regarded the &s;oil as their own. They were in a &s;avage &s;tate, di&s;po&s;ed to be inimical to whoever at|tempted to &s;ettle upon their lands, and to op|po&s;e the encroachments of European emi|grants. But the mea&s;ures of William Penn were not tho&s;e of force, not the u&s;e of arms, not the exertion of power, he &s;ought not to entwine his temples with the trophies of con|que&s;t, or to reader him&s;elf terrible&mdash;he &s;ha|ded his brow with the olive, and di&s;tributed its branches among the belligerent tribes&mdash;his mea&s;ures were at once adequate to the attain|ment of every object that he had in view, and were calculated to e&s;tabli&s;h and pre&s;erve har|mony with, to acquire the friend&s;hip of, and to do ju&s;tice to tho&s;e, who were the prior oc|cupants of the &s;oil. No blood&s;hed, no &s;tra|tagem, no outrage took place, but the &s;ecuri|ty of the colony, re&s;ted upon the confidence of the Indians, and was pre&s;erved by a due adherence to ju&s;tice and humanity.</P>
<P>Contra&s;t the progre&s;s and occurrences on this occa&s;ion, with tho&s;e of the colonization of New-Spain, and &s;ay, what benefit was there which was derived by the Spani&s;h &s;ettlers,
<PB N="16" REF="028967_0016_0FDDC67CDB7FC3B0">
which was not enjoyed by the companions of William Penn? And yet, the former conquer|ed by ma&s;&s;acre, whil&s;t the latter &s;ubdued the &s;avage, by contributing to the alleviation of his nece&s;&s;ities. The former triumphed by the arts of war, the latter, by tho&s;e of peace. Hence, I think, it may be inferred, that the impracticability of effecting by pacific mea|&s;ures, all that violent ones are capable of, is at lea&s;t very problematical, if not improbable.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;pirit which dictated the policy of &s;tates and nations to decide differences be|tween them by arms, it may be rea&s;onably be|lieved, &s;ugge&s;ted tho&s;e &s;anguinary codes of criminal juri&s;prudence, which prevail, in mo&s;t, for the pre&s;ervation of tranquillity and order among the individuals of each, and for the puni&s;hment of &s;uch as tran&s;gre&s;s, the munici|pal regulations of them.</P>
<P>The inju&s;tice and cruelty of the&s;e codes, have, of late years, been greatly deprecated, and owe their continuance in a great mea&s;ure, to a belief, that more moderate ones would be found le&s;s adequate to the prevention of crimes. But this opinion grows weaker and weaker every day; and the &s;tate of Penn&s;yl|vania, has &s;et an example, in trying the ex|periment of a reform in this re&s;pect, the ex|cellencies, and &s;ucce&s;s of which, render it worthy of imitation in every civilized coun|try.</P>
<P>Another objection, which is made to the exemption of friends from military &s;ervice, is the unfairne&s;s and unrea&s;onablene&s;s of a part

only of the citizens, being compellable to per|form it. But, if this be a natural, a con&s;ti|tutional right, re&s;erved to the citizens of that de&s;cription, with which however all di&s;pen&s;e, who come not within the already cited clau&s;e of the con&s;titution, no unfairne&s;s, or unrea&s;on|ablene&s;s exi&s;ts, becau&s;e it is the free and vo|luntary act of tho&s;e, who do not claim the ex|emption, which impo&s;es upon them the per|formance of &s;uch &s;ervice: or, if this were not the ca&s;e, ought not the degree in which friends contribute to the pre&s;ervation of tran|quillity and order, in a &s;tate, and the rarity of its laws, being violated by members of the &s;o|ciety, to entitle them to &s;ome indulgence of their con&s;cientious &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s to enter in|to military &s;ervice?</P>
<P>That &s;uch an exemption would not afford an opportunity to others, who might be de|&s;irous of eluding military &s;ervice; to avoid the performance of it, will appear manife&s;t to every one, who makes enquiry into the ri|gid di&s;cipline of the &s;ociety, in identifying tho&s;e, who are entitled to member&s;hip in it, and of particularly di&s;claiming the preten&s;ions of &s;uch as are not. But as thou art, though not one of the &s;ociety, &s;ufficiently informed on this point, it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me, to en|ter into a detail of the regulations and rules of the &s;ociety, to di&s;play the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch an eva&s;ion becoming practicable.</P>

I therefore di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject here, nor &s;hall I detain thy attention longer, with a&s;&s;ur|ance of per&s;onal regard, per&s;uaded as I am, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to expre&s;s, with how much e&s;teem and &s;incerity, I continue thy friend, and well-wi&s;her,</P>
