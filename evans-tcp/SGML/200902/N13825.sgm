<P>THE Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is a &s;pe|cial manife&s;tation of the love of God to mankind. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour came into the world to put an end to &s;in, to fi|ni&s;h tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and in the room there|of to bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s. Hence he was called Je&s;us, a Saviour, a De|liverer, to &s;ave his people from their &s;ins <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not in their &s;in by a faith or belief in our Sa|viour's outward &s;ufferings, but by a radical change of heart through the operation of his &s;pirit.</NOTE> and in the room thereof to introduce his life, light and &s;pirit in them, that they might &s;erve him, without fear, in holine&s;s,
<PB N="4" REF="017472_0003_0FA121296FF43308">and righteou&s;ne&s;s, all the days of their lives. Hence we are told, John i. 12. That as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the &s;ons of God. Him&s;elf kindly invites his creatures to par|take of this love, Matt. xii. 28. <Q>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden and I will give you re&s;t.</Q> No circum&s;tance of life can &s;eparate or in|capacitate us from being made partakers of this love; ever the mo&s;t aba&s;ed appear to be the particular objects of his care, I&s;aiah lxvi. 1. <Q>The Heaven is my throne and the earth is my foot&s;tool&mdash;but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite &s;pirit and trem|ble&s;h at my word</Q> The plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of the work of redemption, in oppo&s;ition to the perplexed intricacies of tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems of religion taught in the &s;chools, &amp;c. is mo&s;t worthy of note. Where a feeling &s;en&s;e of our natural cor|ruption prevails, and a &s;incere de&s;ire of being delivered from the power of evil, with a convincment that this great work is alone to be perfected by obedience to the teaching of the &s;pirit of grace, the work of redemption is &s;o plain and ea&s;y, that we read I&s;a. xxxv. 8. The wayfaring men, though fools &s;hall not err therein.</P>

<PB N="5" REF="017472_0004_0FA1212A2FA46558">through obedience, in the minds of the &s;incere hearted, has from the beginning of the world been verified in the experi|ence of people of every kind and nation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. viii. 11.

The account given by &s;ome of the fir&s;t of the&s;e was, that be|ing, through divine favour, made de&s;irous of leading an orderly, religious life, they found a violent oppo&s;ition in them&s;elves, to this good work, from the hardne&s;s, or as they termed it, the badne&s;s, which they felt in their hearts, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. xvii. 9.

<PB N="6" REF="017472_0005_0FA1212AEF9B87D0">granted their reque&s;t, they finally experi|enced the hardne&s;s, and badne&s;s of their hearts taken away; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxvi. 26.

In this di&s;po&s;ition they have continued now, for about thirty years, notwith&s;tanding the ill treatment they have received from Indians and others: more e&s;pe|cially of late that they have been pillaged, their &s;etilements at three towns broke up, and they car|ried away captives towards Canada.

The &s;implicity and plainne&s;s of the Go&s;|pel call, farther appears in the account given by Edward Andrews, a per&s;on, af|terwards, an eminent in&s;trument in the hand of God, in gathering many towards the fold of re&s;t. His re&s;idence was at that time in the Jer&s;eys, near the Sea-&s;hore, among&s;t a wild &s;ort of people, Indians and others, vain and loo&s;e in their conver&s;ation, fond of frolicking, mu&s;ic and dancing; among&s;t the&s;e he acted the part of a fiddler. In this &s;ituation, as he was one day work|ing in his field, he came acro&s;s a part of a human body, which he had &s;een before, which, as he now &s;aw it, lying on the ground, a thought &s;truck him, that it was not right to &s;uffer a part of his fellow-crea|ture to be thus thrown up and down in the open field; but that he ought to do with it as he would de&s;ire to be done by in the like condition; after &s;ome rea&s;oning in this &s;ort, he decently buried it, and re|turned to his work again, with an an&s;wer of peace in his mind. From that time he grew pen&s;ive, the pure witne&s;s of truth ro&s;e in him, by which he was made &s;en&s;i|ble he had &s;pent many years in vanity, that it was high time for him to turn unto the Lord, and a de&s;ire was begot in him to experience an inward acquaintance with God, and be favoured with power from
<PB N="8" REF="017472_0007_0FA1212D2ECA1A88">him, to for&s;ake his vanity and loo&s;e living the iniquity of which was then opened to him; and he found a call in his mind to de&s;troy that fiddle, which had been &s;o much an in&s;trument to lead him&s;elf, and others, to the mi&s;pending their precious time; this he concluded to do, when he went home; but delaying to perform this re&s;olution, as he lay in his bed he felt the fire of God's wrath kindled, on ac|count of his di&s;obedience, which induced him, the next day, to break the fiddle in pieces, which, when done his heart rejoiced, and he felt a &s;trength of hope ri&s;ing in him, that God would give him farther power over all his vanities: A &s;en&s;e was al&s;o given him, that if he was faithful to what the Lord would require of him, he &s;hould be made an in&s;trument in God's hand, to ga|ther a people to his prai&s;e, from tho&s;e very loo&s;e people among&s;t whom he re&s;ided, which &s;eemed &s;trange to him. But as his heart became daily more and more exer|ci&s;ed towards God, and in giving him thanks, for his mercies, a lively concern and de&s;ire came upon him, that &s;inners might be brought, as he had been, to a &s;ight of the error of their ways. He then found it to be his duty to &s;peak to tho&s;e &s;ame people, whom he had led on in folly and vanity, and to direct them to the &s;er|vice
<PB N="9" REF="017472_0008_0FA1212DEF326D90">of God; this he at fir&s;t found to be hard work; but being charged by the &s;pi|rit, to be faithful to what was required of him; and made &s;en&s;ible that if he was &s;o, God would be with him, but that if he re|fu&s;ed, he &s;hould be left to him&s;elf, and fall into a wor&s;e condition than that he was in before, he was enabled to &s;peak to them, though in great fear, and the Lord cau&s;ed his admonition to be well received by his neighbours. And on the next day of wor|&s;hip, in&s;tead of &s;pending their time in riot|ing and exce&s;s, as they were u&s;ed to do, &s;ome of them &s;at with him to read the &s;crip|tures, and confer together upon the things which related to eternity; in which his under&s;tanding was opened to &s;ee, that the right wor&s;hip of God was to be performed in &s;ilence, unle&s;s when moved by the &s;pirit to appear in vocal &s;ervice, under which pro&s;pect he found him&s;elf moved to kneel down and pray; and, &s;ometime after, to exhort his companions, which was accom|panied with &s;o much energy and power, that the people were much affected: Thus the Lord mani&s;e&s;ted his love and power among&s;t tho&s;e people, by this mean in&s;tru|ment, till by degrees, a religious meeting was gathered to the prai&s;e of God, who&s;e baptizing power was &s;en&s;ibly felt among&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="017472_0009_0FA1212EAF93BFA0">them; in which &s;ervice he continued du|ring the whole cour&s;e of his life.</P>
<P>By the&s;e and many more in&s;tances which could be mentioned, the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;a|tion is undoubtedly confirmed to be a ma|nife&s;tation of peculiar love and good will to men, through a communication of the &s;pirit of grace, influencing the hearts of tho&s;e who &s;ubmit to its operation, whereby the hearts of the faithful being repleni&s;hed, it abundantly flows out in acts of good|ne&s;s, &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion to their fel|low-men, and leads not only to pity and commi&s;erate tho&s;e who remain in bondage to their corruption, but al&s;o to overcome the evil they may inflict, with benignity, patience and love.</P>
<P>When chri&s;tianity, con&s;idered in this light, is compared with the pride, the &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s and the wrath, &s;o predominant in the world, particularly in the indulgence of tho&s;e lu&s;ts, which the apo&s;tle declares to be the occa&s;ion of war, with all its de|&s;tructive and corrupting effects, it cannot but &s;trike the con&s;iderate mind with amaze|ment and horror.</P>
<P>Several hi&s;torians ob&s;erve, that at the battle of Cunnersdorf, between the Pru&s;&s;ians and the Mu&s;covites, in 1759, the carnage was truly horrible, about twenty thou&s;and Pru&s;&s;ians lay on the field; the lo&s;s of the
<PB N="11" REF="017472_0010_0FA1212F70901930">Ru&s;&s;ians, amounted to ten thou&s;and. At the battle of Zorndorf, the lo&s;s of the Ru&s;|&s;ians, amounted to ten thou&s;and dead on the &s;pot, and ten thou&s;and wounded mo&s;t of them mortally. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the war, from 1756, to 1760, page 314.</NOTE> To think how many of the&s;e were dragged from their connec|tions, and compelled to kill or be killed, &s;eparated from a wife, a parent, or child|ren, who &s;tood in need of their affectionate care and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but more e&s;pecially to con&s;ider the number, which were &s;uddenly cut off from life, and driven into eternity, in the bitterne&s;s of wrath and revenge or other exce&s;&s;es, to which the life of a &s;oldier is &s;o much expo&s;ed, from any farther pow|er of an&s;wering the end of their exi&s;tence, mu&s;t occa&s;ion very &s;olemn reflections to every con&s;iderate, feeling, mind. And if we turn our eyes from this deplorable &s;pec|tacle, towards the many thou&s;ands <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome ca&s;es were the vanqui&s;hed retreats be|fore the victor, many thou&s;ands are after battle, left to die in the field.</NOTE> who, after &s;uch battles remain alive, in a wound|ed condition; many &s;o &s;orely as to be obliged to undergo the painful amputation of their limbs, or perhaps more grievous operation, to &s;uffer long under the cure. And yet more piteous is the ca&s;e of tho&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="017472_0011_0FA121302F63AB08">who&s;e wounds, beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of cure or for want of &s;ufficient help, die in painful langui&s;hment. From this view of the dreadful effect of war, there will naturally ari&s;e a query, in the minds of every rea|&s;onable, feeling, heart, why and whence does &s;uch &s;hocking &s;cenes take place among&s;t men of humanity and rea&s;on, to &s;ay nothing of chri&s;tianity; a &s;cene contra|ry to every idea of that mutual affection and good will, which nature and duty, &s;o forcibly calls for, from creatures &s;o help|le&s;s in them&s;elves, and who &s;tand in &s;uch need of one another's &s;ympathy and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, originally formed, by one common father, for the purpo&s;e of &s;erving and ho|nouring him, through a life of virtue, thankfulne&s;s and love, which, him&s;elf de|clares, is be&s;t manife&s;ted by mutual endear|ments, in patience and love to each other. To the&s;e ob&s;ervations, which will nece&s;&s;a|rily occur to tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;en&s;es are not to|tally deafened, or heart quite hardened by the lu&s;t of revenge, the lu&s;t of honour, the de&s;ire of wealth; it is generally an|&s;wered, that the ca&s;e is grievous indeed, but that there is no other means of prevent|ing inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion from reigning in triumph, but by the means of war. If tho&s;e who make this an&s;wer, would en|deavour to quiet the tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions of
<PB N="13" REF="017472_0012_0FA12130EFC4C668">nature, &s;uffer rea&s;on and humanity to &s;peak, and only con&s;ider from the idea implanted in us, from our youth, of our Maker's goodne&s;s, they cannot otherwi&s;e think, but that if he was properly &s;ought unto, he would provide different modes of &s;ettling tho&s;e differences, which will natu|rally ari&s;e from the different tempers and intere&s;t of mankind. He has expre&s;sly de|clared him&s;elf to be a God, hearing prayer, For the oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor, and for the &s;ighing of the needy, now will I ari&s;e &s;aith the Lord, P&s;alm lxxvi. 9. That he is &s;o ready to fulfil the de&s;ire of the hone&s;t hearted, that even before they call he will an&s;wer, whil&s;t they are yet &s;peaking he will hear, I&s;a. lxv. 24. And to remove all doubts of every right petition being an|&s;wered; our Saviour brings it to the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible feelings of nature, even to the tender connection of a father, to his child; <Q>if a &s;on, &s;ays he, a&s;k bread of any of you who is a father, will he give him a &s;tone; or if he a&s;k a fi&s;h, will he give him a &s;corpion; if you then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the holy &s;pirit, to tho&s;e that a&s;k it.</Q> Luke xi. 11. But in fact men, who are encouragers of war, either give way to an evil heart of unbelief,
<PB N="14" REF="017472_0013_0FA12131B129D0C0">or take plea&s;ure in indulging their wrath, their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and pride, or the more ini|quitous de&s;ire of advancing their fortunes. That wars are mentioned in the Old Te&s;ta|ment to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted before the time of our Saviour's appearance upon earth, makes nothing in its favour under the di&s;|pen&s;ation of peace and univer&s;al love, un|der which we now live, which he came to e&s;tabli&s;h. The apo&s;tle in the de&s;cription he gives of the occa&s;ion of war, makes no di&s;tinction between pre&s;ent and pa&s;t times, but centers the origin of war wholly in tho&s;e lu&s;ts, which war again&s;t the &s;oul, "ye fight, ye kill, and de&s;ire to have, that ye may &s;pend it upon your lu&s;ts." Hence there is rea&s;on to conclude, wars were allowed to the Jews for the &s;ame rea&s;on, as our Saviour tells them, Mo&s;es &s;uffered them to put away their wives, becau&s;e of the hardne&s;s of their hearts, and was a violence upon that purity and brotherly love, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the beginning. Neither does the force u&s;ed in the &s;upport of civil order, to regulate the weak and ill di&s;po&s;ed, make any thing in favour of war. Government is the ordinance of God, a compact and agreement of a number of people, mutually to &s;upport ju&s;tice and or|der among&s;t them&s;elves, upon an infringe|ment of that order, re&s;traint becomes ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="15" REF="017472_0014_0FA121327005CAF0">as mentioned in &s;cripture, <Q>for the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and the prai&s;e of tho&s;e; that do well;</Q> for this purpo&s;e, <Q>that we may lead a peaceable life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty,</Q> which falls &s;olely on the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, upon the breach of their own agreement; hence civil govern|ment will always be nece&s;&s;ary, for the main|tenance of the peace and happine&s;s of mankind. But the ca&s;e is va&s;tly different in the pro&s;ecution of war, when people en|gage in the military &s;ervice, as a profe&s;&s;ion, their ideas of right and wrong become, in a great mea&s;ure, vitiated by many cor|rupt prejudices and cu&s;toms; looking upon war, as the mo&s;t agreeable means of ad|vancing them&s;elves, they often in de&s;pite to the impre&s;&s;ions of grace, and the feelings of humanity wi&s;h for it, and endeavour to promote it. And here the &s;everal innocent and u&s;eful employments, either of agricul|ture or mechani&s;m, &s;o congenial with our health of body and peace of mind, are ge|nerally &s;lighted or de&s;pi&s;ed; a vain e&s;teem for the importance of his &s;ituation, gene|rally takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind of the warrior, which cau&s;es him to behold with undervaluement and &s;corn, every other way of life. That golden rule of doing as we would be done unto, &s;o much the glory as it is the happine&s;s of humanity, is given
<PB N="16" REF="017472_0015_0FA1213330C76570">up for a fooli&s;h idea of human glory; the mo&s;t empty fanthom that ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the di&s;tracted mind of man, or &s;ome other vain or corrupting pur&s;uit, which centers in human life; the calls of humanity and rea&s;on are, avowedly, no more to regulate our conduct, the maxims generally agreed to, by the military men, mu&s;t &s;uper&s;ede all other con&s;iderations; one of which is, that where a fortified place refu&s;es to obey the enemies &s;ummons, and is taken by &s;torm, tho&s;e within may be put to the &s;word, even though the &s;oldiers and inha|bitants were not parties to their command|ers imprudent re&s;olution, neverthele&s;s they mu&s;t fall victims to this horrible maxim. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Several hi&s;torians mention the dreadful tragedy which was acted at the city of Magdeburg, by the Au&s;trian General Tilly, who having taken it by &s;torm, delivered up the citizens, without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex, to the barbarity and lu&s;t of his &s;ol|diers. Be&s;ides the general ma&s;&s;acre, they exhibited &s;uch acts of wanton cruelty, as di&s;grace human na|ture.

<P>And here a rea&s;onable query ari&s;es.

<P>The &s;entiments of that celebrated author A. De Voltaire, upon the &s;olemn &s;ubject of war, is worthy of note. In the fir&s;t vol. of his works, he ob&s;erves "That the primitive chri&s;tians, without exception, held the &s;ame &s;entiments with relation to war as did the E&s;&s;enees and &s;ome others; and as the Quakers now do. Tertullien he &s;ays, &s;peaks with the mo&s;t &s;trength upon the&s;e legal murders, which our abominable nature has made &s;o nece&s;&s;ary; that there is no law nor u&s;uage that can ju&s;tify this cri|minal act. In other parts of his works he &s;ays, It would &s;eem that the law of loving our neighbours as our&s;elves was made only for the Quakers; and in truth, how can any one pret&eacute;nd that he loves his neighbour as him&s;elf, when for reward he will &s;hoot or &s;tab him, and, at the &s;ame time he ex|po&s;es him&s;elf to be killed, might it not ra|ther be truly &s;aid, That he hates his neigh|bour as him&s;elf. He reproaches the preachers of the time when he wrote, who made &s;o many &s;ermons again&s;t impurity and other &s;maller evils, whil&s;t they were &s;ilent again&s;t tho&s;e various kinds of murder, tho&s;e robberies, tho&s;e violences and that

Put together, &s;ays he, all the vices of all ages and places, and they will not come up to the mi&s;chiefs or enormities of one cam|paign." He appears to have a pro&s;pect of a time, when as he &s;ays, "That part of mankind dedicated to heroi&s;m, will be e&s;teemed the mo&s;t execrable and de|&s;tructive mon&s;ters in nature."</P>
<P>Under the&s;e afflictive pro&s;pects, we have rea&s;on to return thanks to the great and good Father of mankind, in that, there is a remnant, under different religi|ous denominations who remain, un&s;haken|ly convinced, that the voice of rea&s;on, the feelings of humanity, and more e&s;pecially the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, calls upon them to bear a uniform te&s;timony again&s;t every thing which is incon&s;i&s;tent with that pati|ence and love, which the go&s;pel propo&s;es; and which, in any mea&s;ure tends to impede its e&s;tabli&s;hment, agreeable to the antient prophecies. Hence they can in no wi&s;e &s;up|port that &s;pirit which gives life to war in any of its branches, but apprehend them|&s;elves uniformly called to promote to the utmo&s;t of their power, the welfare of all men, to ble&s;s tho&s;e that cur&s;e them, and do good to tho&s;e that hate them, thus to overcome evil with good, agreeable to the

<P>And however worldly men, or &s;hort-&s;ighted politicians, may conclude, that no other means but that of war can be pur|&s;ued to protect their re&s;pective countries from oppre&s;&s;ion; yet in&s;tances are not want|ing, of the ble&s;&s;ing which has attended upon contrary mea&s;ures. Penn&s;ylvania furni&s;hes an in&s;tance how far the divine ble&s;&s;ing may co-operate with the &s;pirit of
<PB N="23" REF="017472_0022_0FA12139315A1820">peace and good order; &s;o long as the go|vernment continued chiefly in the hands of a people principled again&s;t war, notwith|&s;tanding their expo&s;ed &s;ituation, the great number of Indians within their borders, and the &s;everal warlike nations which &s;ur|rounded them, they experienced the pro|tecting hand of providence, and enjoyed an uninterrupted tranquillity for more than &s;ixty years; whil&s;t Canada, and mo&s;t of the other colonies who pur&s;ued different mea&s;ures, &s;uffered dreadfully from their In|dian neighbours. Ancient hi&s;tory al&s;o fur|ni&s;hes a &s;triking example of the happy ef|fect which a &s;pirit influenced by the fear of God, producing moderation and univer&s;al benevolence will produce. Numa Pompi|lius, the &s;econd king of Rome, is a parti|cular in&s;tance of this intere&s;ting truth, born &s;ome hundred years before the chri&s;|tian Era, he appears to have been in a &s;pecial manner one of tho&s;e wi&s;e heathens, mentioned by the apo&s;tle, who, from a con|formity to that inward principle of divine intelligence, which all men are favoured with, doing by nature the things contained in the law, was a law unto them&s;elves; which &s;hewed the works of the law writ|in their hearts. Some of the&s;e were doubt|le&s;s favoured, as our Saviour declares Abraham was, with a &s;ight of his day, a
<PB N="24" REF="017472_0023_0FA12139F096C438">day of good tidings to the meek, and &s;pe|cial peace and good will to men. Numa's natural di&s;po&s;ition for moderation, probity, and ju&s;tice, had been greatly &s;trengthened by a proper education. Inured betimes to indu&s;try and labour, and extremely aver&s;e to ambition and violence, he infu&s;ed the &s;ame &s;entiments in his &s;ubjects. Numa, &s;ays Rollin, had a great veneration for the Deity, who&s;e nature and perfections were his &s;tudy. He deemed true goodne&s;s to con&s;i&s;t in ruling the pa&s;&s;ions, and keeping them in &s;ubjection to rea&s;on. Luxury and magnificence, were unknown to him. He plainly &s;aw that to accompli&s;h his de&s;ign, and infu&s;e the &s;ame &s;entiments into the Ro|mans, his fir&s;t care mu&s;t be to &s;often and tame their minds, in order to extingui&s;h by degrees, that inclination for war, which Romulus had in&s;pired them with; and in|&s;en&s;ibly turn them to &s;uch pacific, gentle, and profitable exerci&s;es, as would cau&s;e them to forget and lo&s;e this fir&s;t inclination. The remembrance of the Deity, whom Numa endeavoured &s;hould be always pre|&s;ent in their thoughts; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numa laboured to bring the Romans from that wretched inclination, &s;o prevalent with mankind, of corpolizing the divinity. Hence, Plutarch ob&s;erves, that he forbade to repre&s;ent God in the form of man or bea&s;t; no painted or graven image was admitted among&s;t them; thinking it great impiety to repre&s;ent the mo&s;t excellent Being, by things &s;o ba&s;e and un|worthy. He taught them, that there was no po&s;&s;ible acce&s;s to the Diety, but by the minds being rai&s;ed and elevated by divine contemplation. That he &s;eemed to favour the Pythagorien doctrine of &s;ilence, in a familiar and con&s;tant attendance on the Deity, who was not &s;ubject to &s;en&s;e or capable of pa&s;&s;ion, but invi&s;ible, incorruptible and to be comprehended only by the mind. Hence Numa, before his ad|vancement to the throne, &s;pent much of his time in unfrequented groves and fields, con&s;ecrated to the Diety, not out of melancholy, or di&s;turbance of mind; but becau&s;e he had experienced a more &s;ub|lime conver&s;ation, by which he became &s;killed in matters of a divine nature. Plutarch adds, That it was not &s;trange that God &s;hould be plea&s;ed to dwell with tho&s;e who were more eminently virtuous. That many in pa&s;t ages had been thus favoured with the love of God.</NOTE> the indu&s;try and
<PB N="25" REF="017472_0024_0FA1213AAF6890F0">moderation, he had in&s;tilled in the Ro|mans, cau&s;ed that warlike people to lay down their arms, and employ them&s;elves, throughout his whole reign, which la&s;ted forty three years, in conciliating the favour of heaven, cultivating their land, and the other innocent employments of a country life; which proved an excellent &s;chool of &s;implicity, frugality and other moral vir|tues. "He dedicated him&s;elf intirely to the &s;ervice of the citizens and &s;trangers, to whom he was coun&s;ellor, arbiter and judge. All, &s;ays Livy, formed their man|ners
<PB N="26" REF="017472_0025_0FA1213B6F2F48E0">by the King's, whom they took for their &s;ole pattern." Hence the nations about him who before had con&s;idered Rome more like a camp than a city, con|ceived &s;uch a reverence for them, that they would have thought it a &s;ort of impiety to have attacked a people, wholly intent upon &s;erving God, and making men happy.</P>
<P>A wonderful change of manners al&s;o prevailed in the neighbouring cities; the people vi&s;ited one another without fear, uniting in religious &s;ervices, and rejoicing together, as if Numa's wi&s;dom had been a plentiful fountain, from whence the &s;treams of virtue and ju&s;tice had flowed in|to the minds of the people; in&s;tead of a martial ardor, an eager de&s;ire to live in peace, to cultivate their lands, and bring up their children in the &s;ame, infu&s;ed into their hearts the &s;ame tranquillity which reigned in his own.</P>
<P>The nations around, were &s;o far from taking advantage of his pacific temper, to make war upon him, that in their differen|ces, they cho&s;e the Romans for umpires, and referred them&s;elves entirely to Numa's deci&s;ions; a glory founded on the e&s;teem and gratitude of the nations, who paid a public homage to the wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice and &s;incerity of a prince, void of &s;elf intere&s;t and &s;olely intent on the happine&s;s of man|kind.
<PB N="27" REF="017472_0026_0FA1213C2F8E31C0">Neither did any rebellion appear during the long reign of Numa, whether, &s;ays Plutarch, reverence for his eminent virtue, or fear of the Diety, who &s;o vi&s;ibly protected him, vice was di&s;armed; or whether, by a particular providence, Hea|ven was plea&s;ed to pre&s;erve this happy reign from whatever might &s;ully its glory, or di&s;turb its peace; it has &s;erved for a proof of what God, in his mercy and love can do, in rendering virtue triumphant over vice. Numa ended his life in the gentle&s;t manner, by nature's being quite exhau&s;ted, in the 83d year of his age, and 43d of his reign.</P>
<P>If Plutarch, though an heathen, under the prevailing prejudices in favour of war, could manife&s;t &s;o much e&s;teem for the maintainance of peace, as freely to acknow|ledge the di&s;play of a particular providence in Numa's protection, from the violence of unrea&s;onable men, as a &s;pecial mark of the divine approbation on his diligent labour, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of virtue in a people, before &s;o daring in rapine and murder, how much more have chri&s;tians rea&s;on to rely upon the &s;ame divine protection, in the maintenance of that love to their fellow|men, and patient &s;uffering of injuries, &s;o &s;trongly enjoined by the precepts and practice of their great exampler Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="017472_0027_0FA1213CEFD01CC0">
And certainly men thus peaceably di&s;|po&s;ed, have great rea&s;on to expect to be protected by the rulers wherever their lot may be ca&s;t, as the&s;e rulers cannot but be &s;en&s;ible of the advantages which ari&s;es from the virtuous example of per&s;ons &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e vices which war na|turally produces. For, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome chri&s;tians look upon defen&s;ive war as lawful; yet &s;ober men, of every religious denomination agree, that it is a great evil and much to be depricated; hence great tenderne&s;s is due to tho&s;e who, in &s;incerity of heart, apprehend them&s;elves called out of the &s;pirit of war, to the promotion of harmony and love.</P>
<P>We al&s;o find Cardinal Fleury, long Prime Mini&s;ter of France, under the late King, to have been a per&s;on of much mildne&s;s and moderation, and a great lover of peace. He had &s;een the dreadful mi&s;ery occa&s;ioned by the pro&s;ecution of a long war, during great part of the reign of Lewis the 14th, which &s;everal writers of that reign &s;ay, gave the old king &s;o much concern, that, upon his death-bed, he exhorted his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, the late king, to u&s;e mea&s;ures dif|ferent from tho&s;e he had pur&s;ued. The good di&s;po&s;ition which prevailed in this car|dinal, in favour of pacific mea&s;ures is thought to have, in a great degree, been
<PB N="29" REF="017472_0028_0FA1213DB0AD1EE0">the occa&s;ion of the long peace, which &s;o generally prevailed among&s;t the different powers of Europe, from the peace of Utrecht, in 1712, to the year 1733. If the influence of one mini&s;ter of &s;tate can have &s;o good an effect, how happy would it be for mankind, and how happy for them&s;elves, if the pre&s;ent rulers of the different kingdoms, would &s;o far yield to that good principle, which every man in his cool moments, is, in &s;ome degree fa|voured with, as to feel for the mi&s;eries of mankind, and become advocates on behalf of the Prince of Peace, and thus promote as much as may be in their power the pre|valency of that peace and love, which not only the prophets, but al&s;o the wi&s;e men of all ages have had a pro&s;pect of, a time of love and good will to men; when righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and peace &s;hall univer&s;ally prevail.</P>
<P>The prejudice that &s;o &s;trongly prevails in the young nobility of mo&s;t European Mo|narchies, in favour of war, which they are taught to look upon as the only bu&s;ine&s;s worthy their attention, very much prevents the e&s;tabli&s;hment of that peace and love among&s;t men, &s;o much the de&s;ire of the well minded. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who do not inhe|rit the family e&s;tate, and indeed mo&s;t who do, enter into the military life; hence the di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions of the human mind, in|&s;tead
<PB N="30" REF="017472_0029_0FA1213E6FC4A340">of being molihed by the &s;oft endear|ments of locial life, are rather increa&s;ed, through the violent and cruel mea&s;ures they are obliged to pur&s;ue.

<P>And, indeed, it mu&s;t be allowed, that tho&s;e evil lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, which are the remote cau&s;es of war, are much &s;upported and encrea&s;ed by that romantic and fal&s;e idea of the honour, re&s;ulting from a mili|tary life, which induces &s;o many of the principal men, of mo&s;t chri&s;tian States, to &s;pend the prime of their days in that &s;er|vice, whence, from a &s;trange infatuation, it is e&s;teemed the greate&s;t honour to ri&s;que the putting a period to their exi&s;tence, be|fore they have an&s;wered the purpo&s;e for which their life was given, even the &s;ub|jection of the corrupt propen&s;ities of na|ture; &s;o as to bring them under the regu|lation of rea&s;on and religion. Wonderful in&s;tance of the corruption of the human heart; that men will voluntarily, and even with plea&s;ure, encounter &s;o much hard&s;hip and labour, in the pro&s;ecution of war, which upon the lea&s;t reflection, they mu&s;t

The fir&s;t, confe&s;&s;ed to Peter Dumoulin, the famous prote&s;tant, that being forced upon many irregularities, by that, which they call rea&s;ons of &s;tate, he could not tell how to &s;atisfy his con&s;ci|ence for &s;everal things, and therefore had many temptations to doubt and di&s;believe a God, another world, and the immortality of the &s;oul, and thereby to relieve his mind from any di&s;quiet, but in vain: So &s;trong, he &s;aid, was the notion of God on his &s;oul, &s;o clear the impre&s;&s;ion of him, upon the frame of the world, &s;o unanimous the con|&s;ent of mankind, &s;o powerful the convic|tions of his own con&s;cience, that he could

And being a&s;ked one day, why he was &s;o &s;ad; an|&s;wered, The &s;oul is a &s;erious thing; it mu&s;t be either &s;ad here for a moment, or &s;ad forever.</P>
<P>Cardinal Mazarine, reputed the cun|ninge&s;t &s;tate&s;man of his time, and who gave great proofs of it in the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the French crown, under his mini&s;try: His aim was the grandeur of the world, to which he made all other con&s;iderations &s;ubmit. But, poor man; he was of ano|ther mind a little before his death: For be|ing awakened by the &s;mart la&s;hes of con|&s;cience, which repre&s;ented his &s;oul's con|dition very di&s;mal, with a&s;toni&s;hment and tears he cried out. "O my poor &s;oul, what will become of thee: Whither wilt thou go" And &s;peaking one day to the Queen Mother of France, he &s;aid "Ma|dame, your favours have undone me: Were I to live again, I would be a Capu|chin, rather than a Courtier."</P>

Bul&s;trod Whitlock, him&s;elf, gives a noble te&s;timony to the power of religion. "I ever have thought, &s;aid he, there has been one true religion in the world, and that is, the work of the &s;pirit of God in the heart of &s;ouls of men. There has been indeed divers forms and &s;hapes of things, through the many di&s;pen&s;ations of God to men, an|&s;werable to his own wi&s;e ends, in reference to the low and uncertain &s;tate of man in the world; but the old world had the &s;pirit of God, for it &s;trove with them, and the new world has had the &s;pirit of God, both Jews and Gentiles; and it &s;trives with all; and they that have been led by it, have been the good people in every di&s;pen&s;ation of God to the world. And I my&s;elf mu&s;t &s;ay, I have felt it, from a child, to convince me of my evil and vanity, and it has often given me a true mea&s;ure of this poor world, and &s;ome ta&s;te of divine things; and it is my grief I did not more early apply my &s;oul to it.

<P>THERE is but one thing, that de&s;erves our highe&s;t care, and mo&s;t ardent de|&s;ires and that is, that we may an&s;wer the
<PB N="44" REF="017472_0043_0FA1214A709B9A80">great end for which we were made, viz. to glorify that God, who has given us our beings, and all our comforts, and to do all the good we po&s;&s;ibly can to our fellow-men, while we live in the world: And verily life is not worth the having, if it be not im|proved for this noble end and purpo&s;e, yet, alas, how little is this thought of among mankind; mo&s;t men &s;eem to live to them|&s;elves, without much regard to the glory of God, or the good of their fellow-crea|tures; they earne&s;tly de&s;ire, and eagerly pur&s;ue after the riches, the honours, and the plea&s;ures of life, as if they really &s;up|po&s;ed that wealth, or greatne&s;s, or merri|ment, could make their immortal &s;ouls happy. But, alas, what &s;al&s;e and delu&s;ive dreams are the&s;e, and how mi&s;erable will tho&s;e ere long be, who are not awaked out of them; to &s;ee, that all their happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in living to God, and becoming holy, as he is holy. Oh! may you never fall into the tempers and vanities, the &s;en|&s;uality and folly of the pre&s;ent world, you are, by divine providence, le&s;t as it were alone, in a wide world to act for your&s;elf; Be &s;ure then to remember, it is a world of temptation. You have no earthly parents, to be the means of forming your youth to piety and virtue; let this excite you with greater diligence and fervency to look up
<PB N="45" REF="017472_0044_0FA1214B2FE959B0">to the Father of mercies, for grace and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance again&s;t all the vanities of the world.

<P>Be careful to make a good improvement of precious time. When you cea&s;e from labour, fill up your time in reading, medi|tation and prayer. And, while your hands are labouring, let your heart be employed as much as po&s;&s;ible in divine thoughts. Never expect happine&s;s from the world. If you hope for happine&s;s in the world, hope for it from God, and not from the world. Don't think you &s;hall be more happy, if you live to &s;uch or &s;uch a &s;tate of life, if you live to be for your&s;elf, to be &s;ettled in the world, or if you &s;hould gain an e&s;tate in it; but look upon it, that you &s;hall then be happy, when you can be con|&s;tantly employed for God, and not for your&s;elf; and de&s;ire to live in this world, only to do and &s;uffer what God allots you. When you can be of the &s;pirit and temper of Angels, who are willing to come down into this lower world, to perform what God commands them, tho' their de&s;ires are heavenly, and not in the lea&s;t &s;et on earthly
<PB N="46" REF="017472_0045_0FA1214BEF7F5CE0">things, then you will be of that temper, you ought to have, Col. iii. 2. Never think you can live to God, by your own power or &s;trength; but always look to, and rely on him for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yea, for all &s;trength and grace. There is no greater truth than this, that we cannot do any thing of our|&s;elves. Yet nothing but our own experi|ence can effectually teach it to us. Indeed, we are a long time in learning that all our &s;trength and &s;alvation is in God.</P>

And Oh! how divinely &s;weet and entertaining it is to look into our own &s;ouls, when we can find all our powers and pa&s;&s;ions, united and en|gaged in pur&s;uit after God. Verily, there are no hours pa&s;s away with &s;o much divine plea&s;ure, as tho&s;e that are &s;pent in commu|nion with God, and our own hearts. Oh! how &s;weet is a &s;pirit of devotion, a &s;pirit of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and divine &s;olemnity, a &s;pirit of go&s;pel &s;implicity, love, and tenderne&s;s.

Oh! how fix'd and unalterable, Oh! of what in&s;inite importance is it, that we be prepared for eternity; I have been ju&s;t a dying now for more than a week; and all around me have thought me &s;o: But in this time, I have had clear views of eterni|ty; have &s;een the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the godly in &s;ome mea&s;ure, and have longed to &s;hare their happy &s;tate; as well as been comfort|ably &s;atis&s;ied, that, thro' grace, I &s;hall do &s;o!

Oh! me|thought, that I could now &s;ee my friends, that I might warn them to &s;ee to it, that they lay their foundation for eternity &s;ure. Oh! my brother, let me then be&s;eech you, now to examine, whether you are indeed a new creature? Whether you have ever acted above &s;elf? Whether the glory of God has ever been the &s;weete&s;t, highe&s;t concern with you&mdash;whether God has been your portion, and a holy conformity to him, your chief delight? If you cannot an&s;wer po&s;itively, con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly the fre|quent breathings of your &s;oul, But don't, however, put your&s;elf off with a &s;light an|&s;wer. If you have rea&s;on to think you are gracele&s;s, Oh! give your&s;elf and the throne of grace no re&s;t, till God ari&s;e and &s;ave. But if the ca&s;e &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, ble&s;s God for his grace, and pre&s;s after holine&s;s.</P>
<P>And now, I &s;hall conclude with the te&s;timony of the pious Bi&s;hop Taylor, Chaplain to King Charles, the I&s;t. with re&s;pect to war. " As contrary as cruel|ty is to mercy, tyranny to charity, &s;o is war and blood&s;hed, to the meekne&s;s and gentlene&s;s of the chri&s;tian religion I had often thought &s;ays he, of the prophecy. <HI>That in the go&s;pel our &s;words &s;hould be turned into plow-&s;hares, and our &s;pears into pruning books.</HI> I knew that no tittle &s;poken by God's &s;pirit, could return unperformed. and ineffectual; and I was cer|tain, that &s;uch was the excellency of Chri&s;t's doc|trine, that if men would obey it, chri&s;tians &s;hould never war one again&s;t another."</P>
