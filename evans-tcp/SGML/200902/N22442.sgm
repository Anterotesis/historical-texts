<HEAD>THE Scriptures Con&s;ulted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT having been publicly a&s;&s;erted in a large congre|gation as a &s;cripture truth, That unbelievers are under the law and under the cur&s;e, engaged me to look into the &s;criptures for the &s;atisfaction of my own mind, to &s;ee if the&s;e things were &s;o; and knowing the apo&s;tle to have this &s;ubject in view in his epi&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> I have repeatedly looked it over with attention, and found two pa&s;&s;ages which &s;eemed at fir&s;t view, to favour the thought, that unbelievers were under the law, &amp;c. namely, <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 10. <Q>As many as are of the works of the law are under the cur&s;e; for it is written, Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law, to do them.</Q> Are not unbelievers of the works of the law? Do they not univer&s;ally go about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s? and are they not con&s;equently under the cur&s;e?</P>
<P>For an&s;wer it may be &s;aid, They are &s;o in their own apprehen&s;ions; their unbelief places them there, and there they mu&s;t remain in their own minds, till they believe the report of the go&s;pel, which is, Chri&s;t hath delivered us from the cur&s;e of the law, being
<PB N="4" REF="029651_0003_0FE2108DB6A5D670">
made a cur&s;e for us. Yet this go&s;pel is true before it is believed, yea, though it be not believed, &s;hall our unbelief make the faith of God of none effect? God forbid.</P>
<P>The other pa&s;&s;age is <HI>Gal.</HI> v. 18. <Q>If ye be led by the Spirit of God ye are not under the law.</Q> Doth not this imply that they were under the law that were not led by the Spirit? What is the mean|ing of the pa&s;&s;age? What is meant by being led by the Spirit? I think the &s;imple meaning is, being led by the Spirit's teaching, who takes of the things of Je&s;us, and &s;hews them unto us; therefore, if our minds receive the truth of the te&s;timony concerning Je&s;us, we are led by the Spirit; the Spirit's teaching leads to under&s;tand and believe the written word; and that a&s;&s;erts, ye are not under the law, but under grace, therefore if the mind gives in to the Spirit's teaching, it finds this a truth, for the Spirit witne&s;&s;|eth to the truth of the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Let us then, as being led by the Spirit, follow his teaching by the apo&s;tle and all the brethren that (&s;aith he) are with me who &s;ay, <HI>Gal.</HI> iv. 4. <Q>When the fulne&s;s of time was come, God &s;ent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.</Q> Here the following thoughts offer to view, <HI>viz</HI> That all that were under the law were redeemed, therefore, if there are any not redeemed, they mu&s;t be tho&s;e that were not under the law; for, to a&s;&s;ert that Je&s;us Chri&s;t did not accompli&s;h what he came for, would amount to a denial that Je&s;us is come in the fle&s;h : but he came to redeem them that were under the law, and the apo&s;tle &s;ays expre&s;sly, he accompli&s;hed it; <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 13. <Q>Chri&s;t hath delivered us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us.</Q> <HI>He hath delivered us.</HI> Who? Them that were under the law. The apo&s;tle and all the brethren with him be|lieved
<PB N="5" REF="029651_0004_0FE2109028518498">
it, and united in their endeavours to bring back the fooli&s;h bewitched Galatians that were removed from him that called them, into the grace of Chri&s;t to another go&s;pel, to the belief of it, which they would not have done if it were not an original truth. Now, if Chri&s;t had not delivered us from the cur&s;e of the law, and we believed he had not, we could not be denominated, Unbelievers: but &s;ince he hath, and the &s;criptures plainly and fully a&s;&s;ert it, tho&s;e mu&s;t be denominated unbelievers, that believe we are &s;till under the law and under the cur&s;e ; be&s;ides, "he that believeth entereth into re&s;t;" but what re&s;t can he that believeth that we are under the law and under the cur&s;e, have on believing ; if it were a truth, it could never make any man free. But, he that be|lieveth the &s;cripture te&s;timony, that Chri&s;t hath deliv|ered us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us, believes a truth calculated to free the mind from the &s;pirit of bondage, to fear and introduce the &s;pirit of adoption, crying, Abba Father.</P>
<P>If Chri&s;t hath not delivered us from the cur&s;e of the law, it is impo&s;&s;ible we ever &s;hould be, for Chri&s;t dieth no more, and it is impo&s;&s;ible for the belief of a lie to deliver us. Now, our deliverance from the law is by the body of Chri&s;t, <HI>Rom.</HI> vii. 4. and for this end; <Q>that we might be married to another, to him who is rai&s;ed from the dead.</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps mini&s;ters little think, while they are en|deavouring to prove unbelievers under the law, and calling them to come to Chri&s;t, they are calling them to &s;piritual adultery, to have two hu&s;bands, to be wedded to Chri&s;t while the law is not dead, wherein they were held. The apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erts in forementioned <HI>Rom.</HI> vii. 4, 6. we are delivered from the law by the body of Chri&s;t; <Q>But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held.</Q> Being become dead to the law by the body of Chri&s;t,
<PB N="6" REF="029651_0005_0FE2109292593460">
not by believing, not by any thing in or about us, or done by us, <HI>but</HI> by the body of Chri&s;t; and being de|livered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held, no wonder the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 14. "Ye are not under the law, but under grace."</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians</HI> &s;aith, chap. iii. 23 to 25, <Q>Before faith came we were kept under the law, &s;hut up unto the faith that &s;hould after be reveal|ed; wherefore the law was our &s;chool-ma&s;ter unto Chri&s;t, that we might be ju&s;tified by faith; but after that faith is come, we are no longer under a &s;chool-ma&s;ter.</Q> Before faith came, I &s;uppo&s;e he means before Chri&s;t came, who is the object of faith that was after to be revealed, which is, I apprehend, the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel, which reports the faith to be believed, which is that <Q>in the fulne&s;s of time God &s;ent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that were under the law.</Q></P>
<P>Now when Je&s;us had fulfilled the law in his life, and &s;uffered the penalty in his death, being made a cur&s;e for us, his re&s;urrection manife&s;ts our di&s;charge, &s;o that we are no longer under a &s;chool-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is &s;aid in <HI>Rev.</HI> xii. 10. <Q>The accu|&s;er of our brethren is ca&s;t down, which accu&s;ed them before our God day and night.</Q> <HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> Who is the accu&s;er of our brethren? We have the an&s;wer from Chri&s;t him&s;elf, <HI>John</HI> v. 45. <Q>Do not think that I will accu&s;e you to the Father, there is one that accu&s;eth you, Mo&s;es, in whom ye tru&s;t.</Q> Mo&s;es, <HI>i. e.</HI> the law, accu&s;eth our brethren before our God day and night; but the accu&s;er of our brethren is ca&s;t down, and they overcome by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their te&s;timony, not by what is wrought in them or done by them; and they loved not their lives unto the death. While under the law in their own apprehen&s;ions, nothing is more
<PB N="7" REF="029651_0006_0FE21099B0D6C6F0">
terrible than the thought of death, being all their lives in bondage through fear of death: but when they know the accu&s;er is ca&s;t down, and they overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their te&s;ti|mony, this alteration follows. No wonder John heard a loud voice &s;aying in heaven, <Q>Now is come &s;alvation and &s;trength and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>To what has been &s;aid, it may be objected, It is &s;aid, <HI>John</HI> iii. 36. <Q>He that believeth on the Son hath everla&s;ting life, and he that believeth not the Son &s;hall not &s;ee life, but the wrath of God abid|eth on him.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Mark</HI> xvi. 16. <Q>He that believeth &s;halll be &s;av|ed; and he that believeth not &s;hall be damned;</Q> which two places &s;eem to attribute our deliverance from the wrath of God, and from damnation to be|lieving; which phra&s;es &s;eem &s;imilar to the cur&s;e of the law.</P>
<P>For an&s;wer it may be &s;aid, that in <HI>Mark</HI> xvi. 15, Je|&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aith to his eleven di&s;ciples, <Q>Go ye into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature.</Q> They were authorized to tell the good news to <HI>every</HI> creature, which was true concerning every creature, el&s;e he would not have &s;ent it to them.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, every creature is a &s;inner, the whole world guilty before God; to every creature this news is &s;ent. What news? The go&s;pel, that God was in Chri&s;t, reconciling the world unto him&s;elf; not im|puting unto them their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es: it a&s;&s;erts, he hath made him &s;in for us, who knew no &s;in, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him (not in our|&s;elves). <Q>Chri&s;t hath delivered us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us.</Q> This is the go&s;pel to be preached as a truth to every creature. He that believeth it to be a certain truth, is con&s;e|quently &s;aved from that perplexity, di&s;tre&s;s and hor|ror
<PB N="8" REF="029651_0007_0FE2109B42E001F8">
that ari&s;es in the mind from an apprehen&s;ion of the wrath of God, con&s;equent on being &s;elf-condem|ned as a breaker of God's law; while he that believ|eth not, &s;tands in his own mind, where he was, con|demned already: the &s;en&s;e of the wrath of God abiding on him. Yet, neverthele&s;s, the good news of the go&s;pel is as true as if it were believed, but be|ing di&s;credited affords no relief, and it is that which denominates an unbeliever, <HI>viz.</HI> not believing the truth of the good news of the go&s;pel. What is &s;aid on <HI>Mark</HI> xvi. may &s;erve as an an&s;wer to <HI>John</HI> iii. 36. only look of the foregoing ver&s;es.</P>
<P>To u&s;e a &s;imilitude: Having &s;tept into a court of ju&s;tice among men, a law-breaker is condemned for breach of law, and &s;entenced to what the law inflicts in that ca&s;e; I hear the &s;entence pronounced as I go in, and &s;ee the offender &s;ent back to pri&s;on till the &s;entence of law is &s;atisfied, which he hath no hope ever to &s;atisfy. I inquire, Why is he thus &s;entenced? I am an&s;wered, He hath broken the law.</P>
<P>After he is gone, &s;ome one hath pity on him, pays that the law demands, and procures a receipt from the clerk of the court, and &s;ends the news to the pri&s;|oner, who is on the point of rejoicing exceedingly; but &s;ome fellow-pri&s;oner tells him it is only a decep|tion, it doth not mean as it is expre&s;&s;ed; he may de|pend on it he will not be relea&s;ed till he has paid the utmo&s;t farthing. If he believes the lie, he will &s;till lie under the &s;ame condemnation. Seeing him not|with&s;tanding, ca&s;t down, I inquire the rea&s;on of his di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery. Seeing the &s;entence of law is &s;atisfied, the an&s;wer is, Becau&s;e he doth not believe the truth reported to him; but believed a lie, which is the rea&s;on why he retains in his mind the &s;ame condemnation. <Q>He that believeth not is condem|ned already, becau&s;e he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="029651_0008_0FE2109CD04F3778">Unbelief keeps the mind under the law on the left hand, where can be heard nothing but, Go ye cur&s;ed. The go&s;pel reports that <Q>Chri&s;t hath delivered us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us.</Q> This being believed, brings the mind under the go&s;pel on the right hand, where it hears; Come ye ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I think this view of unbelievers being damned of &s;elf-condemned, being under the wrath of God in their own apprehen&s;ions, may be illu&s;trated from &s;ev|eral pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture that &s;peak of believers: we read of the younger widows having damnation, be|cau&s;e they ca&s;t off their fir&s;t faith. Undoubtedly, what they believed with their fir&s;t faith was true; or their fir&s;t faith was a true faith, el&s;e they would not have damnation becau&s;e they ca&s;t it off; but there is nothing but damnation takes place in the mind if the fir&s;t faith is ca&s;t off, or they cea&s;e to believe the report of the go&s;pel to be true.</P>
<P>To u&s;e a &s;imilitude: Take a piece of dry &s;ole-leather, it is full of air, ca&s;t it into the water; as the water enters, the air will go out, and you may &s;ee it ri&s;e in bubbles till filled with water, and has expel|led the air.</P>
<P>If the belief of the truth emer&s;e the mind and fill it, it rejoices with exceeding great joy. Unbe|lief &s;tands crowding at the door of the mind with all its objections, and &s;o far as it gets in, it brings &s;elf-condemnation or damnation with it. But our unbe|lief cannot de&s;troy the truth of the go&s;pel that is preached to every creature: If we believe not, he abideth faithful, he cannot deny him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Hence the exhortations; "We, receiving a king|dom that cannot be moved, let us hold fa&s;t the grace whereby we may &s;erve God acceptably," "Hold faff the form of &s;ound words which thou ha&s;t heard of me in faith and love, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." "Take
<PB N="10" REF="029651_0009_0FE2109F33042288">
heed brethren, left there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief; in departing from the living God; for we are made partakers of Chri&s;t, if we hold the beginning of our confidence &s;tedfa&s;t unto the end."</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle Peter in his &s;econd epi&s;tle, chap i. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. exhorts tho&s;e who have obtained like pre|cious faith, to <Q>add to their faith, virtue; to virtue; knowledge; to knowledge; temperance, patience, godline&s;s, brotherly kindne&s;s and charity: For,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>if the&s;e things be in you and abound, they make neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowl|edge of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Mark what follows: <Q>But he that lacketh the&s;e things is blind, and cannot &s;ee far off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old &s;ins.</Q> It &s;eems, his being purged in Chri&s;t, was his fir&s;t faith, he hath forgotten it; what then must take place in his mind but &s;elf-condemnation or damna|tion? while tho&s;e that do the&s;e things &s;hall never fall; but &s;o an entrance shall be mini&s;tred abundantly, into the everla&s;ting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. What motives have believers to be &s;tedfa&s;t, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing their labour &s;hall not be in vain in the Lord? The belief of the truth, that we are bought with a price, tends to fill the mind with joy that we belong to &s;uch a Redeemer, to &s;uch a Purcha&s;er; and an excitation to glorify God in our &s;pirits and bodies, which are his.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e are damnable here&s;ies that deny the Lord that bought them, and &s;uch mu&s;t unavoidably bring on them&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truction: for, if Je&s;us hath not bought us with his blood, if he hath not delivered us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us, there is nothing but de&s;truction and mi&s;ery, inev|itable &s;wift de&s;truction, there is no go&s;pel to be preached to ANY creature.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="029651_0010_0FE210A5569F7548">But I recollect the apo&s;tle's expre&s;&s;ion, <Q>Be not deceived, evil communication corrupt good man|ner; awake to righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;in not.</Q> To that righteou&s;ne&s;s in which the Father is well plea&s;|ed; which hath magnified the law, and made it honourable: So that the Go&s;pel may be preached to EVERY creature.</P>

<HEAD>To <HI>Mr. Samuel Stillman, MINISTER of the Fir&s;t BAPTIST CHURCH in BOSTON.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS your Di&s;cour&s;e at the public monthly evening Lecture, on the 29th of June, 1795, (wherein you a&s;&s;erted, That unbelievers are under the law and under the cur&s;e) gave occa&s;ion to the collection of the foregoing thoughts, that here pre&s;ent them&s;elves to view. You are reque&s;ted to attend to them, and think whether they are not agreeable to the &s;criptures: If &s;o, do not &s;uffer your own &s;y&s;tem, which may have wrapt your mind imperceivably, to prevent your tel|ling the glad tidings to <HI>all</HI> people.</P>
<P>Sir, be plea&s;ed to a&s;k your&s;elf, "Doth not my &s;y&s;tem confine me from preaching the go&s;pel to every creature? from repeating without limitation, the
<PB N="12" REF="029651_0011_0FE210A7089B6A38">
go&s;pel preached to Abraham and confirmed to him by an oath, That in thy &s;eed (which is Chri&s;t) &s;hall all the families of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed; while the p&s;alm|i&s;t a&s;&s;ures us, He hath remembered his covenant for|ever; the word he commanded to a thou&s;and genera|tions which he made with Abraham, and his oath unto I&s;aac, and confirmed the &s;ame to Jacob by a law?"</P>
<P>It &s;eems probable, that the law by which he con|firmed the &s;ame to Jacob and to I&s;rael for an ever|la&s;ting covenant, was the law of circumci&s;ion, origi|nally given as a token of the covenant, which was a &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the faith, which Abraham had, yet being uncircumci&s;ed. Is not this &s;eal u&s;ed by the Jews among all nations to this day, as a &s;tand|ing te&s;timony of the truth of the go&s;pel preached to Abraham, which in&s;ures the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of all the na|tions, kindreds, and families of the earth in Chri&s;t Je&s;us? Dare any of our Father's children pre&s;ume to break his will thus &s;ealed, by &s;aying, It did not mean all the nations of the earth, it is only &s;ome out of all nations; it only meant me, an elect believer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Far be it from me to &s;peak lightly of the doctrine of Election, it is the abu&s;e of it only, I wi&s;h to expo&s;e. This doctrine is con&s;id|ered in the collection, entitled, <HI>Go&s;pel News,</HI> page 100, 101, 102, 103; which any one that reads, may judge if it is not &s;poken of agreeable to the Scriptures.</NOTE>, not thou, a reprobate unbeliever? What contentions mu&s;t ari&s;e in the family, whom he hath directed to love one another, con&s;equent hereupon, about the Father's will, which is expre&s;&s;ed &s;o plainly, and confirmed by an oath, and &s;ealed with &s;uch a &s;eal, manife&s;t in all places, where the Jews are &s;cattered to this day.</P>
<P>Again, plea&s;e to a&s;k your&s;elf, Can I publi&s;h with|out re&s;erve, the truth of I&s;aiah's te&s;timony, chap. xliv. 22. <Q>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, and as a cloud thy &s;ins return unto me,

<P>WITH great plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction I have read the greate&s;t part of your An&s;wer to the Que&s;tion, Why am I a Chri&s;tian? The excellency of the moral precepts, and your unan&s;werable argu|ments for the truth of chri&s;tianity, mu&s;t approve them&s;elves to every man's con&s;cience, and be delight|ful to every chri&s;tian reader. But will you bear with me in a &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and love, to take notice of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> which appear to draw a vail over the glory of the go&s;pel, wherein the true God is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from every one that is called God, and appears <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, as it is expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="029651_0015_0FE210B4FA3BB700">
<HI>Micah</HI> vii. 8, 9, 10. <Q>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and pa&s;&s;eth by the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the remnant of his heritage; he retaineth not his anger for ever, becau&s;e he delight|eth in mercy, he <HI>will</HI> turn again, he <HI>will</HI> have com|pa&s;&s;ion upon us, he <HI>will</HI> &s;ubdue our iniquities; and thou wilt ca&s;t all their &s;ins into the depths of the &s;ea; thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou ha&s;t &s;worn to our fathers in the days of old.</Q></P>
<P>If we read the forogoing part of the chapter to the 7th ver&s;e, we &s;hall &s;ee that there is no rea&s;on in man for this gracious declaration. The prophet appeared &s;en&s;ible of this in ver&s;e 7; <Q>Therefore I will look to the Lord, I will wait for the God of my &s;alvation.</Q> Ver&s;e 9; <Q>He will bring me forth to the light, and I &s;hall behold his righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q> Neither is there any expre&s;&s;ed in the three ver&s;es fir&s;t mentioned, it is becau&s;e he delighteth in mercy: He <HI>will,</HI> he <HI>will,</HI> he <HI>will</HI> is three times repeated. <Q>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou ha&s;t &s;worn to our fathers in the days of old:</Q> The mercy and truth included in the go&s;pel preached to Abraham; which is an unconditional go&s;pel.</P>
<P>All fal&s;e religion that I have ever heard of propo&s;es pardon to the penitent and the fulfiller of certain con|ditions, according to their various orders.</P>
<P>The glory of the true God is made manife&s;t in that he finds in him&s;elf a divine rea&s;on, to forgive the mo&s;t de&s;titute and unworthy, for his name's &s;ake, for his mercy's &s;ake, for his truth's &s;ake, for his oath's &s;ake, for the glory of his name.</P>
<P>I would now proceed to take notice of the expre&s;|&s;ions alluded to. You &s;ay in page 5th, &s;peaking of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. "I believe he was authorized by God to proclaim forgivene&s;s to the penitent, and to reveal
<PB N="17" REF="029651_0016_0FE210B68AED8028">
a &s;tate of immortal glory and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s to tho&s;e that fear God and work righteou&s;ne&s;s." When I had read this &s;entence, I pau&s;ed to make a mark in the margin of my book, as follows:</P>
<P>Glory be to God, Je&s;us Chri&s;t is exalted a Prince and Saviour, to give repentance as well as remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, <HI>Acts</HI> v. 31. And he calls us to repentance becau&s;e he has found a divine rea&s;on of forgivene&s;s in him&s;elf. <Q>I, I am he that blotteth out thy tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions for my own &s;ake, and will not remember thy &s;ins.</Q> <HI>I&s;a</HI> xliii. 25. <Q>I have blotted out as a thick cloud, thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and as a cloud, thy &s;ins: Return unto me, for I have redeemed thee,</Q> <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xliv. 22. <Q>I will put my fear in their hearts, and they &s;hall not depart from me.</Q></P>
<P>As I progre&s;&s;ed in reading in page 11th, you pro|fe&s;s your belief, "That God requires obedience to his laws, and con&s;equently re&s;eats the infraction; that forgivene&s;s is po&s;&s;ible and repentance and refor|mation the conditions."</P>
<P>On reading this &s;entence, I pau&s;ed; and, as it were, imagined my&s;elf, while looking on the book, (with grateful admiration and reverence be it &s;poken) &s;urrounded by Mo&s;es and the prophets. Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, as a voice behind me, &s;aying. This is the way.</P>

<P>How will it do to add, <HI>Repentance and reformation are the conditions,</HI> judge ye? Are they the conditions of everla&s;ting love, which is manife&s;t in drawing with loving-kindne&s;s; in helping the &s;elf-de&s;troyed; in healing the back&s;liding, and loving them freely; in &s;ending the go&s;pel to the poor; in &s;aving the lo&s;t; in the gift of God, which is, eternal life through Je|&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord?</P>
<P>The knowledge of divine love thus made manife&s;t,
<PB N="19" REF="029651_0018_0FE210C0A6AFBB78">
is the &s;pring from whence flow repentance and ref|ormation, but they are not the conditions of divine love manife&s;ted in forgivene&s;s. The expre&s;&s;ion ap|pears to me to contain in embryo, the whole doctrine of de&s;ert of grace, held in the Romi&s;h church.</P>
<P>It appears to me a matter of &s;ober importance; &s;uffer me therefore to add, let it have its due weight, and come to a conclu&s;ion in your own mind. Either to preach God our Saviour &s;aving for his own name's &s;ake, and freely giving repentance; as well as remi&s;|&s;ion of &s;ins: Or, &s;aving only on condition of repent|ance and reformation. Be plea&s;ed, Sir, to bring it home; you have a re&s;pectable character among men, and are as likely perhaps, as any, to have performed the conditions of conditional &s;alvation; having had as many advantages therefor as any man. Will or can you plead your repentance and reformation, as the condi|tion of your forgivene&s;s, before God? Or mu&s;t you be obliged to go in the &s;trength of the Lord God, and &s;ay with the p&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> lxxi. 16, <Q>I will make mention of thy righteou&s;ne&s;s, even of thine only.</Q> Let what &s;atisfies your mind, occupy your pen, and proceed from your mouth: permit me to remind you of <HI>P&s;alm</HI> lxxi. 15. 24. as a &s;afe example.</P>
<P><Q>My mouth &s;hall &s;hew forth thy righteou&s;ne&s;s, thy &s;alvation all the day, for I know not the numbers. My tongue al&s;o &s;hall talk of thy righteou&s;ne&s;s all the day long.</Q> If we know not the numbers, we &s;hall find it is a &s;ubject that cannot be exhau&s;ted, the numbers will flow and unfold, to furni&s;h new di&s;cov|eries of grace, mercy, peace and love, to animate the new &s;ong, and employ the tongue all day long, thro' time and eternity.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould think I take too much upon me in the&s;e interrogations, I will pre&s;ent it in the language of &s;cripture, and turn your attention to <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xliii. 25, 26. <Q>I, I am he that blotteth out thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions

for my own &s;ake, and will not remember thy &s;ins. Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: declare thou that thou maye&s;t be ju&s;tified.</Q></P>
<P>Thus I have taken notice of two exceptionable pa&s;&s;ages in your otherwi&s;e truly valuable production, and cannot but hope, I have been con&s;trained thereto from a &s;en&s;e of duty; for the glory of God our Sa|viour, and the benefit of tho&s;e who&s;e minds are per|plexed for want of the conditions you make mention of: And wi&s;h you to e&s;teem me your unfeigned Friend,</P>
