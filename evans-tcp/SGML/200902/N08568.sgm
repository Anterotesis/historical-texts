<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>CAPTAIN DISNEY, with five other Gentlemen, re&s;iding in the Di&s;trict of <HI>Montreal,</HI> had been taken up in the Month of <HI>November,</HI> 1766, for the cruel A&s;&s;ault com|mitted about two Years ago, upon Mr. <HI>Thomas Walker.</HI> They were apprehended by Virtue of Warrants of the Honourable WILLIAM HEY, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> his Maje&s;ty's Chief-Ju&s;tice of the Pro|vince of <HI>Quebec,</HI> which are &s;ounded upon a long, minute, and po&s;itive Information given again&s;t them, upon Oath, before the &s;aid Chief Ju&s;tice, by <HI>George M'Govock,</HI> a Soldier of the 28th Regiment of Foot, who declared him&s;elf to have been an Accomplice with them in that Affair, and to have been an Eye-witne&s;s of all the proceedings in it. The Per&s;ons &s;o apprehended immediately came to <HI>Quebec,</HI> and applied to the Chief-Ju&s;tice to be bailed; and many of the principal Per&s;ons in the Province offered to become bound for their Appearance, at the en&s;uing Se&s;&s;ion of the Supreme Court, at <HI>Montreal,</HI> in order to take their Trials. But, by rea&s;on of the Magnitude of the Crime, (it being a Capital Offence, of a very odious Nature) and the Po&s;itivene&s;s of the Charge again&s;t them, the Chief-Ju&s;tice thought he was not at Liberty, con&s;i&s;tently with the Rules of Law, to admit them to Bail; grounding his Opinion herein, both on the general Principles of the Law relating to Bail in criminal Ca&s;es, and on &s;ome very &s;trong modern Authorities on this Sub|ject, and particularly the two Ca&s;es of <HI>Acton</HI> and <HI>Greenwood,</HI> reported in Sir <HI>John Strange</HI>'s Reports, Page 851 and 1138, which &s;eem to be deci&s;ive in the Point. They were therefore committed to Cu&s;tody, but confined in the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t in|dulgent Manner po&s;&s;ible in Mr. <HI>William Grant</HI>'s Hou&s;e, at <HI>Montreal,</HI> which is &s;aid to be the be&s;t Hou&s;e in the Province; it having been &s;ugge&s;ted, as a Ground for this Indulgence, that the King's Pri&s;on at <HI>Montreal</HI> was in bad Repair, and not in a fit Condition to receive them. On the 28th Day of the <HI>February</HI> following, in the Year 1767, the Chief-Ju&s;tice held a Se&s;&s;ion of the Supreme-Court of Judicature at <HI>Montreal,</HI> both for criminal and civil Matters, which was continued by &s;everal Adjournments to the Middle of <HI>March.</HI> And about the 8th or 9th Day of <HI>March,</HI> a Bill of Indictment, that had been pre&s;ented to the Grand Jury again&s;t Captain <HI>Di&s;ney,</HI> by the Attorney-General was returned by them a true Bill; and on the 11th Day of the &s;ame Month, Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> was tried upon this Indictment, and acquitted.</P>

<HEAD>After the Pri&s;oner had pleaded not guilty to the Indictment, and the Jury were duly &s;worn and charged to try the I&s;&s;ue, the Ca&s;e was opened to the Court and Jury by FRANCIS MASERES, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> his Maje&s;ty's Attorney-General for the Province of <HI>Quebec,</HI> (who was the only Per&s;on of Coun&s;el for the Crown on this Occa&s;ion) in &s;ome &s;uch Manner as hereafter followeth:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Honour, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is my Duty, as Pro&s;ecutor for the Crown, on the pre&s;ent Oc|ca&s;ion, to lay open to you the Circum&s;tances of the Crime with which the Pri&s;oner at the Bar &s;tands charged; which I am per&s;uaded you will look upon as one of the mo&s;t outrageous Violations of the of the public Peace and Order that ever was brought before a Court of Ju&s;tice; Nothing le&s;s than a&s;&s;aulting a Magi&s;trate of unblemi&s;hed Character in his own Hou&s;e, in the Night-time, with an Intention to murder him;&mdash;and this in Revenge for an Act done by him as a Magi&s;trate, in Conjunction with three other Magi&s;trates of the Province, in Support, as he thought, at lea&s;t, of the Laws and Liberties of his Country.&mdash;If this is an Action that ought not to be the Subject of a Pro&s;ecution, &s;urely nothing can de&s;erve to be &s;o: And if tho&s;e who are charged with being guilty of it are ju&s;t Objects of the Compa&s;&s;ion of the Public, I know not what Offenders can excite their Indignation. It approaches in a great Degree to the mo&s;t dangerous of all civil Crimes, High Trea&s;on it&s;elf, as it has an immediate Tendency to over awe, to check, and even entirely to &s;top the Proceedings of the Magi&s;trates of the Pro|vince in the Admini&s;tration of Public Ju&s;tice; without which our excellent Laws are but a dead Letter, and our boa&s;ted Liberties and Properties an empty Sound: And it was attended with Circum&s;tan|ces of deliberate Malice, Revenge, and Cruelty, that, in the Opini|on of all Per&s;ons not de&s;titute of the Feelings of Humanity, mu&s;t make it completely odious: To which may be added the le&s;s impor|tant Circum&s;tance of the cowardly Manner of its Execution, if the employing ten or twelve armed Men to &s;urpri&s;e and attack one poor, un&s;u&s;pecting, unarmed Man, &s;itting peaceably at Home in the Com|pany of his Wife and Family, can entitle it to that Appellation.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve further, that the Per&s;ons who committed this Outrage were Military Men: For &s;urely this is an Aggravation of the Offence. It is in them an Act of Treachery: It is betraying the high and honourable Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by their King and Country, by employing to the Purpo&s;es of Revenge and Malice tho&s;e Arms which had been put into their Hands for the Protection of their Fellow-Subjects, and the Maintenance of the Public Tranquility.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will now lay before you, in the fir&s;t Place, the Oc|ca&s;ion that gave ri&s;e to the Crime with which the Pri&s;oner at the
<PB N="8" REF="010958_0005_0F852F26A1647E10">
Bar &s;tands charged, and afterwards the Manner and Circum&s;tances of its Execution and the Share the Pri&s;oner at the Bar took in it.</P>
<P>When the Civil Government was e&s;tabli&s;hed in this Province, in the Year 1764, a Number of Per&s;ons, in the Di&s;trict of <HI>Montreal,</HI> were commi&s;&s;ioned by Governor MURRAY, to act as Ju&s;tices of the Peace for that Di&s;trict, and new and great Powers of determining. Matters of Civil Property, not belonging to tho&s;e Magi&s;trates in <HI>England,</HI> were given them by the great Ordinance of <HI>September</HI> 17th, of that Year, by which the Courts of Judicature were erected. Among the Per&s;ons &s;o commi&s;&s;ioned were Mr. <HI>Thomas Walker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dumas St. Martin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Living&s;ton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Knipe,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lambe:</HI> The&s;e Gentle|men, as I am informed, all of them acted in their new Office with Honour and Integrity, and gave general Satisfaction to the People by their diligent Endeavours to promote their Welfare. There was one Abu&s;e in particular which they earne&s;tly laboured to reform, as it was then very generally and very &s;everely felt by the Inhabitants of <HI>Montreal,</HI> and the Subject of frequent Complaints. This was the Oppre&s;&s;ion exerci&s;ed by &s;ome Officers of the Army, under the Co|lour and Pretence of their Right of billetting Soldiers. The Power of appointing Billets was often employed by them to &s;erve the Pur|po&s;es of gratifying their private Di&s;gu&s;ts, and of extorting Money from the People. Three or four of the mo&s;t drunken and riotous of the Soldiers would be &s;ent to take up their Quarters at the Hou&s;e of a &s;ub&s;tantial Citizen, that was thought able to pay a good Price for an Exemption. This would alarm him, and oblige him to make the humble&s;t and mo&s;t earne&s;t Intreaties to be excu&s;ed from receiv|ing them; upon which an Intimation would be given him, that, if he would con&s;ent to pay Six or Eight Dollars a Month in Lieu of it, he might be excu&s;ed, and the Soldiers with that Money would pro|vide them&s;elves other Quarters. This the poor Man would readily &s;ubmit to (if he could by any Means rai&s;e the Money) rather than &s;ee his Hou&s;e taken up, his Furniture broken and &s;poil'd, his Provi|&s;ions wa&s;ted, and &s;ometimes his Wife and Daughters in&s;ulted by &s;uch boi&s;terous and profligate Inmates: And thus by paying the Tax required he would obtain his Exemption. They would then go to another Citizen of two, and by the like Menaces extort from them the like Contributions. Tho&s;e were the Oppre&s;&s;ions which Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> and his Fellow-Magi&s;trates endeavoured to remove. Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> in particular, drew out a Scheme for billeting the Soldiers, by which he made it appear, that there was no Nece&s;&s;ity that more than two Soldiers &s;hould ever be quartered in one Hou&s;e, whereas there were &s;everal Hou&s;es at that Time that were burthened with five or &s;ix: So that the Hard&s;hips the People laboured under in this Re&s;pect were by no Means Evils of Nece&s;&s;ity (in which Ca&s;e they ought patiently to have been &s;ubmitted to) but were mere Abu&s;es of Power, to an&s;wer the&s;e &s;ini&s;ter Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010958_0005_0F852F26A1647E10">Gentlemen, in the Beginning of the Month of <HI>November,</HI> 1764. Complaint, that took its Ri&s;e from this Power of billeting, was brought before Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Living&s;ton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dumas,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lambe,</HI> the Ju&s;tices of the Peace before mentioned, again&s;t Captain <HI>Benjamin Charnock Payne,</HI> of the 28th Regiment, which proved the immediate. Occa&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Sufferings. Captain <HI>John Fra&s;er,</HI> Pay-Ma&s;ter-General of the Troops in the Di&s;trict of <HI>Mon|treal,</HI> and one of the Pri&s;oners now in Cu&s;tody on Account of this Affair, had been billeted by Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Chri&s;tie,</HI> the Quar|ter-Ma&s;ter-General, on the Hou&s;e of one Mr. <HI>Reamue,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman in <HI>Montreal,</HI> where he accordingly re&s;ided till the latter End of <HI>October,</HI> or Beginning of <HI>November,</HI> 1764, at which Time he was appointed to an Office by which he became entitled to, or at lea&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, a Hou&s;e at the Public Expence; upon which he left his Quarters at Mr. <HI>Reaume</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and went to live in the Hou&s;e, &s;o a&s;&s;igned him. Mr. <HI>Reaume,</HI> imagining his Billet was at an End, immediately invited Mr. <HI>Knipe,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, who was at that Time in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace, and who occupied the Rooms underneath tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Captain <HI>Fra&s;er</HI> and had hired tho&s;e likewi&s;e of Mr. <HI>Reaume,</HI> at the Time that Cap|tain <HI>Fra&s;er</HI> was about to leave them, but had not yet taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, to come and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them according to his Agreement. But he was prevented from doing &s;o by Captain <HI>Payne,</HI> who took, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them in the Name and Right of Cap|tain <HI>Fra&s;er,</HI> who in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;till retained a Right to the&s;e Quar|ters, and might either occupy them him&s;elf, if he &s;o thought fit, or permit any other Per&s;on to occupy them in his Name. Mr. <HI>Reaume</HI> de&s;ired Captain <HI>Payne</HI> to re&s;ign them to Mr. <HI>Knipe,</HI> to whom he had let them; but Captain <HI>Payne</HI> refu&s;ed to quit them, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his Right to continue in them by Virtue of Captain <HI>Fra&s;er</HI>'s Billet. Mr. <HI>Knipe</HI> thought the&s;e Preten&s;ions of Captain <HI>Fra&s;er,</HI> to occupy the&s;e Quarters thus by Deputy, to be both hard and illegal, and wrote two or three Letters to him to complain of them: But, in&s;tead of receiving any kind of Satisfaction, he was an&s;wered in a Style of in|credible and un&s;ufferable In&s;olence. Upon this he applied to the other Ju&s;tices for Redre&s;s; and Mr. <HI>Living&s;ton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dumas,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> held a Court in Mr. <HI>Reaume</HI>'s Hou&s;e, to inquire into the Affair; and being &s;atisfied by the Depo&s;itions of Mr. <HI>Knipe</HI> and Mr. <HI>Reaume,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Knipe</HI> had, by a fair Agreement, hired the Apartments in in Que&s;tion of Mr. <HI>Reaume,</HI> long before Captain <HI>Payne</HI> came into them, and being of Opinion likewi&s;e that Captain <HI>Fra&s;er</HI>'s Right to them was at an End the Moment he became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at the Public Expence of another Lodging, which he thought a better one, they determined that Mr. <HI>Knipe</HI> had a legal Right to the Apartments, and that Captain <HI>Payne</HI> ought to re&s;ign them to him.

in Conjunction with Mr. <HI>Lambe,</HI> a fourth Ju&s;tice of the Peace, they &s;igned a Warrant to a Bailiff, to command Captain <HI>Payne</HI> to quit that Lodging. In what Manner this Command of the Ju&s;tices was to be enforced, I do not find to be certainly agreed. Tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to cen&s;ure this Proceeding of the Ju&s;tices, &s;ay that there was a Clau&s;e in the Warrant commanding the Bailiff to carry Captain <HI>Payne</HI> to Pri&s;on, if he refu&s;ed to quit the Lodging, and &s;hould make Re&s;i&s;tance; others inform me otherwi&s;e: This however &s;eems to be certain, that it was never their Intention that Captain <HI>Payne,</HI> &s;hould be impri&s;oned. This will appear by the &s;ub|&s;equent Part of their Conduct.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will now minutely inquire how far the&s;e Proceed|ings of the Ju&s;tices were legal, that is, how far they had Right to inquire into and determine this Conte&s;t between Mr. <HI>Knipe</HI> and Cap|tain <HI>Payne,</HI> and to enforce their Deci&s;ion of it (if they did &s;o en|force it) by the Penalty of Impri&s;onment. But I will only ob&s;erve that there &s;eems to be a very rea&s;onable Ground for &s;uppo&s;ing that all the&s;e Things were within their Juri&s;diction by Virtue of the Powers before mentioned, given by the great Ordinance of <HI>Septem|ber</HI> 17, 1764, to any two Ju&s;tices of the Peace to hear and deter|mine any Di&s;putes concerning Matters of Civil Property, not ex|ceeding the Value of ten Pounds, which probably might take in the pre&s;ent Conte&s;t. Nor need we inquire whether or no the Deci&s;ion they thought proper to make, that Captain <HI>Payne</HI> had no Right to the&s;e Apartments, was good in Point of Law: Though here, as well as before, I &s;hould incline to think that the Law was with them: For, if we con&s;ider that the being free from the Nece&s;&s;ity of quar|tering Soldiers is one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t valued Privileges of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subject&mdash;that it is one of the great Points of Liberty a&s;certained and confirmed for ever by that be&s;t of Laws in the Statute-Book, the Petition of Right in the third Year of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t&mdash;That all the Laws of <HI>England</HI> had been introduced into this Province by the great Ordinance of the 17th of <HI>September,</HI> 1764, and that the&s;e favourite and beneficial ones were promi&s;ed by the King's Proclamation, in 1763&mdash;and that in <HI>England</HI> it&s;elf the Troops are only quartered hi Public-Hou&s;es, but never in pri|vate ones; and that only by Virtue of a particular Act of Parlia|ment, annually pa&s;&s;ed for that purpo&s;e; we &s;hall nor wonder at the unwillingne&s;s &s;hewn by the&s;e worthy Magi&s;trates to allow of the Le|gality of billeting Soldiers upon private Hou&s;es upon any other Ground but that of mere Nece&s;&s;ity; or for any longer Time than &s;uch Nece&s;&s;ity continued; of which, in the Ca&s;e then before them, there could be no Pretence, &s;ince the Moment Captain <HI>Fra&s;er</HI> re|ceived a Hou&s;e from the Government, in con&s;equence of his new Employment, which by going to live in it he acknowledged to be better than his Quarters, it was evidently no longer nece&s;&s;ary that
<PB N="11" REF="010958_0006_0F852F27512A8FD0">
tho&s;e Quarters &s;hould belong to him. But whether they were right or wrong in their Opinions upon the&s;e Points is not very material. This is certain, that they meant to determine a Matter that they took to be within their Cognizance, and that they meant to deter|mine it according to Law, and to do Ju&s;tice to the Per&s;on they thought to be aggrieved. They therefore ought rather to have re|ceived the Thanks of their Fellow-Subjects for their faithful and &s;pirited Di&s;charge of their Duty, than to have become the Objects of &s;o deep and deadly a Revenge.</P>
<P>This Warrant of the Ju&s;tices of the Peace was &s;erved upon Cap-<HI>Payne</HI> the next Day, or rather, if it be true that there was a Clau&s;e of Impri&s;onment in it, but half &s;erved by one of the Bailiffs of of the Di&s;trict. For the Bailiff &s;hewed it him, and required him to give up the Apartments to Mr. <HI>Knipe;</HI> but did not, upon the Cap|tain's refu&s;ing to do &s;o, offer to make him a Pri&s;oner, or convey him to the Gaol. He neither laid hold on him, as is u&s;ual in Arre&s;ts, nor &s;aid to him, <HI>You are to my Pri&s;oner,</HI> nor told him that he had Or|ders to carry him to Pri&s;on. But Captain <HI>Payne,</HI> as if anxiou&s;ly de&s;irous of &s;uffering an Indignity that might &s;erve to irritate the Soldiers to a high Pitch, and di&s;po&s;e them to &s;ome de&s;perate Act of Revenge again&s;t Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> in&s;i&s;ted upon going to Pri&s;on, and forced the Bailiff to &s;hew him the Way thither. The Bailiff com|plied, and the Captain went to Gaol: And when he got there, the Keeper of the Pri&s;on was unwilling to receive him, becau&s;e he had not a Warrant directed to him&s;elf to authorize him to do &s;o. But the Captain in&s;i&s;ted upon continuing in the Pri&s;on. In the mean Time the Bailiff went and acquainted the Ju&s;tices with what had happened, who immediately &s;ent him back to the Pri&s;on to ac|quaint Captain <HI>Payne</HI> that he was not a Pri&s;oner in Con&s;equence of their Warrant, that it never was their Intention to commit him to Pri&s;on, and that he might go out of the Pri&s;on when he plea&s;ed: And at the &s;ame Time they &s;ent him a Billet to be quartered at Mr. <HI>Cro&s;ton's</HI> Hou&s;e, which was the very be&s;t Public-Hou&s;e in the whole Town, the Magi&s;trates being unwilling, except where Nece&s;&s;ity o|bliged them to it, to give Billets upon private Hou&s;es. Captain <HI>Payne,</HI> however, thought fit to continue in the Pri&s;on, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Declarations from the Ju&s;tices that he was at Liberty to leave it whenever he plea&s;ed; and that his Impri&s;onment might be the more public and make the deeper Impre&s;&s;ion on the Spirits of the Soldiers, he had Recour&s;e to a more formal Method of obtaining his Di&s;charge from it, by applying to the Chief-Ju&s;tice of the Province for an <HI>Habeas Corpus:</HI> And by this Means he was &s;et at Liberty.</P>
<P>When the Circum&s;tances of this Affair came to be public, and it appeared that Captain <HI>Payne</HI> had been a voluntary Pri&s;oner, and had continued &s;o for &s;everal Days, it was by mo&s;t People made the
<PB N="12" REF="010958_0007_0F852F281693D4B8">
Subject of Mirth and Laughter. This enraged the Captain to a high Degree, and made him re&s;olve to &s;eek &s;ome immediate Revenge again&s;t the Ju&s;tices, and mo&s;t particularly again&s;t Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> as having been the mo&s;t active Man among&s;t them in all the Com|plaints about the billeting of Soldiers, and, as he imagined, the principal Promoter of the Warrant by which he was ordered to give up his Quarters, and in con&s;equence of which he had committed him&s;elf to Pri&s;on. Soon after a Re&s;olution was taken to puni&s;h Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> for his In&s;olence (that was the Language they made u&s;e of) by &s;etting a Mark upon him, or by disfiguring him in &s;ome &s;ignal and di&s;graceful Manner: And &s;ome of the wickede&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;perate Soldiers of the 28th Regiment, under the Direction of two Sergeants of the &s;ame Character, Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> and Sergeant <HI>Rogers,</HI> were employed to put it in Execution.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, we &s;hall produce a Witne&s;s that was him&s;elf employed in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, and was pre&s;ent at the Execution of it, and who is con&s;equently well acquainted with all the Circum&s;tances attending it. His Name is <HI>George M'Govock,</HI> and he is a Soldier of the 28th Regiment.</P>
<P>He will tell you, among&s;t other Things, Gentlemen, that on <HI>Monday</HI> the 3d of <HI>December,</HI> 1764, that is, three Days before the Perpetration of this Crime, he was de&s;ired by Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> (who and before that Time acquainted him with the De&s;ign and engaged him to be an Actor in it) to go with him to Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI>'s Hou&s;e at <HI>Montreal</HI> (a Lieutenant and Adjutant of the 28th Regi|ment, who was deeply concerned in this Affair) to meet &s;ome Gen|men who were Friends, as the Sergeant told him, to the De&s;ign of configuring Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> though they were not of the 28th Regi|ment, and to take an Oath of Secrecy never to di&s;cover any of them if they &s;hould happen to be pre&s;ent at the Execution of it: That he accordingly went with Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> to Lieutenant <HI>Tot|tenham</HI>'s; and that when they got there, the Lieutenant him&s;elf opened the Door to them, and was accompanied by Captain <HI>Daniel Di&s;ney,</HI> the Pri&s;oner at the Bar, and Lieutenant <HI>Simon Evans,</HI> of the 28th Regiment: That Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> &s;aid to him in the Pa&s;&s;age, in the Pre&s;ence of Captain <HI>Di&s;ney,</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Evans,</HI> and Sergeant <HI>Meas,</HI> &s;ome Words to this purpo&s;e, George, <HI>this Gentle|man</HI> (pointing to Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI>) <HI>and others that are within, are de|&s;irous that you would promi&s;e that, if any of them &s;hould make any Attempt to disfigure</HI> Mr. Walker, <HI>you will never di&s;cover it, and that you would for their further Security, take an Oath to keep it &s;ecret:</HI> That there upon he con&s;ented to take the Oath, and took it immedi|ately, Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> admini&s;tering it to him on a Book which Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> produced, and which the Witne&s;s believes to have been a Bible. Lieutenant <HI>Evans</HI> at the &s;ame Time threatened him, that, if ever he di&s;covered it, he &s;hould &s;oon be made an End of,
<PB N="13" REF="010958_0007_0F852F281693D4B8">
wherever he might happen to live, and that he him&s;elf would blow his Brains out. <HI>Tottenham</HI> thereupon &s;aid to <HI>Evans,</HI> that he need not be afraid of his di&s;covering the Matter; for that Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> and Sergeant <HI>Rogers</HI> knew him very well, and could an&s;wer for his being faithful.</P>
<P>After this Conver&s;ation in the Pa&s;&s;age, Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> and the Witne&s;s <HI>M'Govock</HI> went into the Parlour with Captain <HI>Di&s;ney,</HI> Lieu|tenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Evans;</HI> and there they &s;aw the following Per&s;ons, Captain <HI>John Campbell,</HI> of the 27th Regiment, Captain <HI>John Fra&s;er,</HI> the Per&s;on already &s;poken of, Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>Chri&s;tie,</HI> Deputy-Quarter Ma&s;ter-General; M. <HI>St. Luc la Corne,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Howard.</HI> He &s;taid in this Room about a Quarter of an Hour, during which Time the Re&s;olution taken to di&s;figure Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> was the general Subject of the Conver&s;ation. They all expre&s;&s;ed their Approbation of this De&s;ign, and their Hopes that it would &s;ucceed. This Witne&s;s &s;ays that this Conver&s;a|tion was addre&s;&s;ed to him or Sergeant <HI>Meas,</HI> or &s;poken with an evident Intention that they &s;hould hear it; and that Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> further explained to him the De&s;ign of introducing him and Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> into that Company to be that they might know that tho&s;e Gentlemen who were there a&s;&s;embled were Friends to the De&s;ign of disfiguring Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and that therefore they might not be &s;urpri&s;ed or alarmed if they &s;hould &s;ee them engaged in the Execution of it, either before, or at the &s;ame Time with, and as A&s;&s;i&s;tants to, the Gentlemen of the 28th Regiment.</P>
<P>Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> and the Witne&s;s then quitted the Parlour, after a Stay of &s;omething more than a Quarter of an Hour, and went, by Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI>'s Direction into the Kitchen to drink, and af|terwards returned home about Nine o'Clock.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, What I have here laid before you concerning this Conver&s;ation at Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and the Oath of Secrecy admini&s;tered to this Witne&s;s by the Pri&s;oner at the Bar, I have &s;poken from the Depo&s;ition of this Witne&s;s, which I have here in my Hand and before my Eyes, with particular Care not to go one Jot beyond the Contents of it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I mu&s;t further inform you, that this Oath of Secrecy had a great Effect upon the Mind of this Witne&s;s; a Circum&s;tance that adds con&s;iderably to the Credit of his Te&s;timony. When he had made his fir&s;t Depo&s;ition, which made mention only of Per&s;ons to whom this Oath of Secrecy did not relate (which Depo&s;ition he &s;wore to before Mr. <HI>Dumas St. Martin,</HI> the Ju&s;tice of Peace, on the eight Day of la&s;t <HI>September</HI>) he was a&s;ked whether that Depo|&s;ition contained all he knew of the Matter; upon which he de|clared that it did not, but &s;aid he would not reveal any more, be|cau&s;e he could not do it without accu&s;ing certain other Per&s;ons that were concerned in that Affair, whom he conceived him&s;elf to
<PB N="14" REF="010958_0008_0F852F28D60B3BF8">
be under an Obligation never to di&s;cover, in Con&s;equence of an Oath of Secrecy he had taken for that Purpo&s;e. He was afterwards brought before his Honour the pre&s;ent Chief-Ju&s;tice, to confirm and &s;wear again to this Depo&s;ition in the Pre&s;ence of Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> and my&s;elf. And his Scruple about the Oath of Secrecy being then mentioned as an Objection to his telling the re&s;t of what he knew, he declared that he would be guided by the Opinion and Advice of the Chief-Ju&s;tice and my&s;elf concerning the Obligation of this Oath: And upon our telling him that we thought &s;uch an Oath unlawful and void, that it was unlawful to take &s;uch an Oath, and &s;till more unlawful to keep it, as it was contrary to a prior and &s;tronger Obligation that every Man is under, for the Sake of the Public Good, to declare the whole of what he knows concerning any public Crimes, when called upon to do &s;o in the Cour&s;e of a judi|cial Inquiry, he was per&s;uaded to give up his Scruple and declare the re&s;t of what he knew, which makes the Contents of his &s;econd Depo&s;ition. This Depo&s;ition I took down in the Cour&s;e of a very long Examination in the Pre&s;ence of his Honour the Chief-Ju&s;tice and Mr. <HI>Walker;</HI> and can &s;afely affirm that every Word of it came freely from the Witne&s;s without any Sugge&s;tions what&s;oever from Mr. <HI>Walker;</HI> who&s;e Conduct with re&s;pect to this Witne&s;s, &s;o far as I have been able to ob&s;erve it, has been &s;o very &s;trict and deli|cate, that, in&s;tead of bribing him to &s;wear as he &s;hould dictate to him, as Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Enemies have given out, to invalidate this Wit|ne&s;s's Te&s;timony, he has barely allowed him a nece&s;&s;ary Mainte|nance &s;ince he has made tho&s;e Depo&s;itions, (not without &s;ome Di&s;|&s;atisfaction and Complaints of the Witne&s;s on that Account) and has cautioned him over and over to &s;ay nothing but what he was ab&s;olutely &s;ure of: And now, &s;ince this Witne&s;s has been at <HI>Mon|treal</HI> he has not taken, as I believe, the ju&s;tifiable Precaution (nor have I, nor any other Per&s;on to my Knowledge, taken it for him) of reading over to this Witne&s;s either of his Depo&s;i|tions in Order to refre&s;h his Memory again&s;t the pre&s;ent Trial. We leave him to relate to you what he can him&s;elf recollect of the Circum&s;tances of this cruel Tran&s;action, una&s;&s;i&s;ted either by our Admonitions or his own former Accounts of them. I will not proceed in the Narration of this unhappy Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> the 4th of <HI>December,</HI> the Day after the Meeting above-mentioned at Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI>'s Hou&s;e, a Plot was laid in Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI>'s Hou&s;e in the Pre&s;ence of this Witne&s;s by Ser+geant <HI>Meas,</HI> Sergeant <HI>Rogers, John M'Laughlin, James Coleman</HI> and <HI>Daniel A&s;hman,</HI> Soldiers of the 28th Regiment, to way-lay Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> that very Might about the Du&s;k of the Evening upon his Return from his Store-Hou&s;e to his Dwelling-hou&s;e, which were at the Di&s;tance of about a Furlong from each other. The De&s;ign was to beat and disfigure him. (The Word con&s;tant
<PB N="15" REF="010958_0008_0F852F28D60B3BF8">
u&s;ed in all their Con&s;ultations was, <HI>To disfigure.</HI>) And the Wit|ne&s;s &s;aw them go accordingly in the Evening into proper Places for accompli&s;hing their Purpo&s;e, armed with Bayonets, and one of them with a Broad Sword. They &s;taid upon the Parade in Hopes of meeting with Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> till pa&s;t Eight o'Clock, and then went Home, concluding that Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> mu&s;t have gone Home by &s;ome other Way. And this Witne&s;s heard &s;ome of them that Evening, give this Account of their Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>On the next Day, the <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> another De&s;ign was concerted at Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI>'s Hou&s;e, between the Hours of Ten and Eleven o'Clock in Morning, to way-lay Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> again that Evening near his own Dwelling-hou&s;e, in Order to beat and disfigure him. This Witne&s;s was pre&s;ent at Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI>'s Hou&s;e at the Time this De&s;ign was concerted; and the Per&s;ons who concerted it were Ser|geant <HI>Rogers,</HI> Sergeant <HI>Meas, M'Laughlin, Coleman, A&s;hman,</HI> and <HI>Philip Ca&s;tles,</HI> another Soldier of the 28th Regiment. And accord|ingly about Eight o'Clock that Evening the&s;e Per&s;ons did &s;et out from Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI>'s Hou&s;e to different Parts of the Town, in Parties of two Men each. <HI>Rogers</HI> and <HI>Coleman</HI> were in one of the&s;e Parties, and did meet with Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and were &s;een and taken Notice, of by him, as he will inform you, as Per&s;ons, who, by their Looks and Behaviour, &s;eemed to have &s;ome De&s;ign of attack|ing him. But they were prevented from doing it by the Ap|pearance of &s;ome People that had happened to come out ju&s;t at that Time and followed Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and who, the&s;e Ru&s;|&s;ians apprehended, might interpo&s;e in his Defence or rai&s;e an Alarm in the Neighbourhood. They therefore returned to Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI>'s Hou&s;e about Nine o'Clock. The Witne&s;s <HI>M'Govock</HI> heard them afterwards give this Account of their Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> the 6th of <HI>December,</HI> the A&s;&s;ault was actually com|mitted. And though they had hitherto, according to the Account of <HI>George M'Govock,</HI> intended only to beat and disfigure Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> in &s;uch a Manner as to leave a la&s;ting Mark of Di&s;grace upon him, they now &s;eem to have changed their Purpo&s;e to a &s;afer and more complete Revenge, by re&s;olving fir&s;t to murder him, and then to carry off one of his Ears in Triumph, as the <HI>Indians</HI> do the Scalp of an Enemy. That this was their De&s;ign at the Time of committing this A&s;&s;ault, will appear, not only from the Manner and Violence of the Blows they gave him, &s;ome wounding him on the Head with all their Force with Broad Swords, one with a Tomahawk, another with an Iron Bar upon the Loins, with a De&s;ign to break his Back but from the Words &s;poken by them at that Time, &s;uch as that the would fini&s;h and di&s;patch him, and their Declarations that they though he had been dead before they left him. Tho&s;e Words, and the Blows which they accompanied, and mo&s;t of the Circum&s;tances attending the A&s;&s;ault it&s;elf, will be proved to you by the Te&s;timony of Mr.
<PB N="16" REF="010958_0009_0F852F2C15F2E198">
<HI>Walker</HI> him&s;elf, as well as of the other Witne&s;s; and the Pre&s;ence of Captain <HI>Di&s;ney,</HI> the Pri&s;oner at the Bar, on that Occa&s;ion, to en|courage and animate the Soldiers who give, the Wounds, will be proved to you by the united Te&s;timony of Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker.</HI></P>
<P>About a Quarter before Nine o'Clock at Night, as Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker,</HI> were &s;itting in their Hall at Supper, a &s;udden Noi&s;e was heard at the Door, as of a Number of People &s;triving ha&s;tily to get into the Hou&s;e. This Noi&s;e was occa&s;ioned by their violent Manner of opening the Outer-Door, though &s;hut only upon a Latch. Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> upon hearing it immediately cried out <HI>Entrez,</HI> imagining it was, a Number of <HI>Canadians</HI> coming to Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> up|on Bu&s;ine&s;s as a Ju&s;tice of Peace, as he had that whole Day had a great many &s;uch Applications: But almo&s;t in the &s;ame In&s;tant, look|ing towards the Door, and &s;eeing through the Gla&s;s of the inner Door a Crowd of black Faces ri&s;ing one above another, as they &s;tood on the Steps without, &s;he cried out with the utmo&s;t Surpri&s;e, <HI>Good God! What is this! This is Murder; this is the Army come to revenge them&s;elves.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> &s;aw them fir&s;t; becau&s;e &s;he &s;at with her Face to the Door. Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> &s;at at the other End of the Table, with his Back to the Door and very near it; I think he can|not have been more than four Feet from it, which is a Circum|&s;tance, Gentlemen, it will be proper you &s;hould attend to. While Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> was crying out in the Manner I have mentioned, the Ru&s;&s;ians entered the Room, bur&s;ting open the inner Gla&s;s-Door and breaking one of the Panes of Gla&s;s; and Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed Captain <HI>Di&s;ney,</HI> the Pri&s;oner at the Bar, to be one of them, notwith&s;tanding the Crape he had over his Face, which is but an indifferent Di&s;gui&s;e. Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Exclama|tion made Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> turn his Head back at the In&s;tant they were entering, which gave him an Opportunity of having one &s;hort, but full View of them, and at a very &s;mall Di&s;tance, before he received a Blow: And it was in this full and near View of them that he clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> among&s;t their Number. He al&s;o took &s;uch Notice of two other Faces among them, that he thinks he &s;hould know them again whenever he &s;hould &s;ee them: But he declares they are not any of the Pri&s;oners now in Cu&s;tody in this Place, nor any other Per&s;ons who&s;e Names he is acquainted with.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, upon the Sight of the&s;e A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> &s;tart|ed up from his Chair, and in ri&s;ing received a Wound on the Fore-Part of his Head with a Broad-Sword. This Wound was five In|ches long, and was given with &s;uch a Force that one of Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Servants, who was then attending him and &s;aw it given, con|cluded that it mu&s;t be mortal to him. Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> however did not &s;ink under it, but recollecting that his Arms were in his Bed-Cham|ber, he endeavoured to make towards it, in Hopes of making
<PB N="17" REF="010958_0009_0F852F2C15F2E198">
&s;ome Defence, and for that Purpo&s;e ru&s;hed into the Parlour which lay between the Hall and the Bed-Chamber. But he received &s;o many Wounds from five or &s;ix of the Ru&s;&s;ians as he pa&s;&s;ed, that he never could reach the Bed-Chamber, but &s;unk down, &s;pent with Wounds and the lo&s;s of Blood, into an armed Chair that was &s;tand|ing in the further Corner of the Parlour adjoining to the Door of the Bed-Chamber. In this helple&s;s Condition he received &s;everal more Wounds and Blows all over his Body, both with Bludgeons and &s;harp Weapons, and in particular one very dangerous Blow on the Bone of his left Leg with &s;ome Iron Weapon, which the Witne&s;s <HI>M'Govock</HI> will inform you was given him by one <HI>Clark,</HI> who was by Trade a Smith, who carried with him a Piece of Iron fitted to his Hand be&s;ides a Bludgeon. He continued in this Situation for a &s;hort Time, half a Minute, perhaps, or a Minute, almo&s;t deprived of his Sen&s;es, but was rou&s;ed to make one more Attempt to defend him|&s;elf by the Terror occa&s;ioned by the Threat of in&s;tant Death. For he heard a Voice, which &s;eemed to come from the oppo&s;ite Corner of the Room, pronounce the&s;e Words, <HI>Damn him, let me come to him, and I'll di&s;patch the Villain with my Sword.</HI> Upon this he looked up, and &s;aw two Per&s;ons, whom he conjectured to be Officers, ad|vancing towards him from the oppo&s;ite Corner of the Room, from which the Voice had &s;eemed to come, one of whom was armed with Pi&s;tols, and the other held a Small Sword in his Hand, which he pointed at Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Brea&s;t. This latter Per&s;on Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> believed to be the Pri&s;oner at the Bar; but as his Eyes were then full of Blood from the many Wounds he had received, and his Mind in great Confu&s;ion, he will not take upon him to &s;wear it was he. But <HI>M'Govock</HI> the Accomplice, who was pre&s;ent on this Occa|&s;ion, will confirm the Su&s;picion of Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and inform you that he &s;aw Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> advance in that Manner, with his Sword drawn, towards Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and heard him pronounce tho&s;e Words. Whoever it was, you will ob&s;erve, Gentlemen, that it proves be|yond a Doubt that the Intention of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins at this Time was to murder Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and not barely to disfigure him. Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> re&s;olved, though quite unarmed, to do what he could to defend him&s;elf, and accordingly advanced towards the&s;e two Per&s;ons and attacked them furiou&s;ly with his Fi&s;ts, and had the good Fortune to put a&s;ide the drawn Sword with his left Hand without receiving a Thru&s;t from it. But he was immediately &s;urrounded by the other Ru&s;&s;ians. One of the&s;e Seized him by the Throat; and Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> did the &s;ame to him, and at the &s;ame Time endeavoured to get near the Fire-Place in Order to take up the Shovel or Tongs for want of better Weapons. Upon this another of them took hold of his Right Thigh, and they both together endeavoured to lift him up and lay him on the Fire; the Terror of which cruel Death giving him new Strength and Spirit, he di&s;engaged him&s;elf from them both,
<PB N="18" REF="010958_0010_0F852F2D110577B8">
by &s;uddenly putting his Hands again&s;t the Chimney-Piece, and pu&s;h|ing him&s;elf from it with all his Force. But in the In&s;tant of his doing this he received a deep and dangerous Wound from another of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins on the left Side of the Head near the Crown, which felled him to the Ground; and &s;oon after, while he lay helple&s;s on the Floor, he received another mo&s;t violent Blow on his Loins, which would have broke his Back (as no Doubt it was intended to do) if it had not been for a large Silver Buckle in the Wai&s;tband of his Breeches, which received the Blow and &s;omewhat broke the Force of it, which was &s;uch that the Buckle was very much bent by it. After this blow on the Back, Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> continuing to lie helple&s;s and almo&s;t motionle&s;s on the Floor, with his Face downwards, one of the Villains either knelt or &s;at upon his right Side, and cut off a Part of his right Ear, and endeavoured at the &s;ame Time to cut his Throat: But finding this to be difficult by Rea&s;on of the Motions Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> made to prevent it by &s;queezing his Head down clo&s;e to his Shoulders, and putting up his left Hand (the little Finger of which was by this Means cut to the Bone) and being in a Hurry to get away, as the Neighbourhood began now to be alarmed, he made of with the Re&s;t of his Companions without effecting it, and carried off the Ear in Triumph. They thought however that they had left Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> either dead or in a dying Condition: For Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> heard one of them &s;ay, ju&s;t before they went off, <HI>Damn him, he is dead,</HI> and another &s;ay, <HI>We have done for him.</HI> And with good Rea|&s;on indeed they might &s;uppo&s;e &s;o, &s;ince there are very few Men in the World that could have &s;urvived &s;uch a Number of Wounds and Blows as he had received, they being no fewer than Three Score, of which Eight were dreadful Wounds from &s;harp Weapons, and Fifty-two were Confu&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Ear was immediately carried to Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham,</HI> as ap|peared by his own Examination, where he &s;ays that two Men in di&s;gui&s;e and ma&s;ked, or with their Faces blacked, came into his Hou&s;e about 9 o'Clock at Night, and throwing down a Piece of Fle&s;h upon the Table, &s;aid, <HI>There's that Ra&s;cal</HI> Walker's <HI>Ear,</HI> and then withdrew without &s;aying a Word more. Mr. <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> the Offi|cer of General <HI>Burton</HI>'s Guard, and Mr. <HI>Baker,</HI> the Surgeon's Mate of the Regiment, were at that Time with Mr. <HI>Tottenham.</HI> But it does not appear that they made any Attempt to &s;top the Men who brought them the Ear. As &s;oon as they were gone, Mr.<HI>Tot|tenham</HI> wrapped the Ear up in a Piece of Paper, and &s;ent Mr. <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> with it to General <HI>Burton,</HI> who &s;ome Hours after &s;ent it to Mr. <HI>Lambe,</HI> the Ju&s;tice of Peace before-mentioned, to be di&s;po&s;ed of as he &s;hould think proper.</P>
<P>The&s;e Particulars of this A&s;&s;ault will all be proved to you by Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> him&s;elf without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Accomplice, who&s;e Evidence however will confirm them and acquaint you with the
<PB N="19" REF="010958_0010_0F852F2D110577B8">
Names of the principal Per&s;ons concerned in the Execution of them. He will tell you that the Blow on the Head that brought Mr. <HI>Wal|ker</HI> to the Ground and quite &s;ubdued him, was given him by Ser|geant <HI>Meas</HI> with a Tomahawk, and that the Per&s;on who gave him the Blow on his Back when he was down was <HI>Thomas Donnelly,</HI> who afterwards boa&s;ted of it in the Hearing of the Witne&s;s, and &s;aid he thought he had broke his Back; and that Sergeant <HI>Rogers</HI> was the Man that cut off his Ear and carried it off.</P>
<P>While &s;ome of the&s;e Ru&s;&s;ians were employed in attacking Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> in the Manner that has been related, others of them were employed in a&s;&s;aulting and driving away the re&s;t of the Family. Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Heard</HI> (who is &s;ince married to Mr. <HI>Wade,</HI> who was &s;itting at Supper with Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker,</HI> and <HI>John Lilly,</HI> Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Clerk) e&s;caped through the Kitchen into the Yard; where, not being pur&s;ued, they remained till the Affair was over. <HI>John Lilly</HI> was attacked by &s;ome of the Ru&s;&s;ians, who gave him three deep Cuts on the Head with a Broad Sword, one of which knocked him down; but recovering him&s;elf pretty &s;oon; he &s;trug|gled with one of the Fellows and pu&s;hed him into a Window, and then ru&s;hed out at the Street Door through the Mid&s;t of a Party of five or &s;ix more of the Ruffians that guarded it, in Order to alarm the Neighbours; to prevent which two of their Number pur&s;ued him, the re&s;t crying out to them, <HI>Damn him; &s;hoot him; don't let him e&s;cape.</HI> But they did not overtake him. And <HI>William Fontaine,</HI> Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Servant, who was waiting upon him at Supper at the Time of this A&s;&s;ault, was pur&s;ued by one of them with a naked Broad-Sword in his Hand into the Gallery: There he e&s;caped the Fury of his Pur&s;uer by leaping down from the Gallery into the Yard through &s;ome of the broken Rails. The Stroke aimed at him by his Pur&s;uer fell upon the Rails of the Gallery, and, as he believed, upon his Coat, as he afterwards found it had been cut.</P>
<P>Such, Gentlemen, were the Circum&s;tances of this tragical Affair. Before I proceed to lay the Proofs of them before you, I will beg leave to mention a few Ob&s;ervations concerning the Nature of the Charges contained in the Indictment.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Charge in the Indictment is for a well known and very high Offence at the Common Law, called a Burglary; which con|&s;i&s;ts in breaking; and entering; a Man's Hou&s;e in the Night time with an Intent to Commit a Felony. In the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e it is charged that the Felony intended to be committed was a Murder, of which I be|lieve, when you have heard the Proofs of the Particulars I have opened to you, you will have little Room to doubt. If this Inten|tion in the Ru&s;&s;ians who a&s;&s;aulted Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> is proved to your Satisfaction, together with the Pre&s;ence of the Pri&s;oner at the Bar at this Tran&s;action, you mu&s;t find him guilty of this fir&s;t Charge in the Indictment, which will render the Con&s;ideration of the &s;econd
<PB N="20" REF="010958_0011_0F852F2E5C456958">
Charge of le&s;s Importance. But if it &s;hould appear to you that the Pri&s;oner was concerned in this Affair, but that there was no Inten|tion to murder Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> (though this is what I cannot well &s;up|po&s;e) the Pri&s;oner mu&s;t be acquitted upon the fir&s;t Charge, and found guilty only upon the Second.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Charge is founded upon the famous Act of Parlia|ment for preventing malicious Maiming and Mutilation, pa&s;&s;ed in the 22d. Year of CHARLES the II. and u&s;ually known by the Name of the <HI>Coventry-Act,</HI> from the brave Sir <HI>John Coventry,</HI> who&s;e Suf|ferings were the Occa&s;ion of making it. Concerning this Act of Par|liament two very &s;trange Opinions have been entertained by &s;ome Per&s;ons in this Province: The Fir&s;t is, that the Act of Parliament is not in Force in this Province; the Second, that, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be in Force here, the Injury done to Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> does not fall within it. I will endeavour to &s;hew the Fal&s;hood of both the&s;e Opinions.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid in Support of the Fir&s;t of the&s;e Opinions, that this Law is not in Force in the other Provinces of <HI>North-America,</HI> and therefore ought not to be &s;o here. This Conclu&s;ion is by no Means ju&s;t. This Province has nothing to do with the other Pro|vinces of <HI>North-America;</HI> nor indeed have tho&s;e other Provinces any Connection with each other. The Laws in each Province are different from tho&s;e in every other, as the different Acts of their A&s;&s;emblies (which have exerci&s;ed a Legi&s;lative Authority in them) and the different Dates of their original Settlement by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plan|ters have contributed to vary them. And the Laws of all the Colo|nies are, from the &s;ame Cau&s;es, different from the Laws of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> it&s;elf. The common Principle, upon which they all &s;eem to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, I apprehend to be this; that every Set of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Planters, upon their fir&s;t occupying and &s;ettling a new Colony, have carried with them the Laws of <HI>England</HI> then in Force at the Time of their leaving it to go to the new Colony: That this is the original Sy&s;tem of Laws which they imported into the new Colony; and that this Sy&s;tem was increa&s;ed or varied either by new Acts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the Settlement of the Colony, contain|ing expre&s;s Words extending to it, or by the Acts of their own A&s;|&s;emblies under the Powers communicated to them by the Royal Charters. Thus the Laws of <HI>England</HI> in Force in the Reign of JAMES the I will be the Ba&s;is of the Laws of a Colony that was fir&s;t &s;ettled in his Reign: And in &s;uch a Colony the <HI>Coventry-Act,</HI> which was made in the Reign of CHARLES II. will not of Nece&s;&s;ity be a Part of the Law of the Colony, becau&s;e that Act does not expre&s;sly mention the Colonies: It will therefore be, or not be, a Part of the Laws of &s;uch a Colony according as their Governor, Council, and A&s;&s;embly &s;hall have, or have not, adopted it, &s;up|po&s;ing that tho&s;e provincial Legi&s;latures have a legal Power to make Laws of that high Importance. And thus it may happen that
<PB N="21" REF="010958_0011_0F852F2E5C456958">
&s;ome of the <HI>North-American</HI> Colonies this Law may be in Force, and not in others. Whether in Fact it is in Force in any of them, we need not here inquire. With Re&s;pect to this Province, it is cer|tain that this excellent Act of Parliament is as much in Force here as Magna Charta, or the Petition of Right, or the Law of HENRY VIII. that takes the Benefit of the Clergy from Wilful murder of Malice aforethought, or any other the mo&s;t u&s;eful or mo&s;t re&s;pected Laws of <HI>England:</HI> For it is founded on the &s;ame Authority with them, namely, the Authority of the great Ordinance of the Legi&s;la|ture of this Country, General MURRAY and his Council, of <HI>Sep|tember</HI> 17, 1764, by which they introduced into this Province, at one Stroke, the whole Sy&s;tem of the Laws of <HI>England</HI> then in Force, and con&s;equently among the re&s;t this excellent Act of Parliament. That Ordinance in&s;titutes the pre&s;ent Court of King's-Bench, or Supreme Court of Judicature, in which we are now a&s;&s;embled, and ordains that the Chief-Ju&s;tice of the Province, who pre&s;ides in it, &s;hall hear and determine all criminal and civil Cau&s;es agreeable to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> which certainly mu&s;t mean the Laws of <HI>England</HI> then in Being. And be&s;ides, the Chief-Ju&s;tice's Commi&s;|&s;ion, which you have heard read, runs in the &s;ame Style with this Ordinance, and directs him to hear and determine all Matters that come before him agreeably to the Laws of <HI>England</HI> and the Ordinan|ces of this Province hereafter to be made. Either therefore this great Ordinance (upon which all the Proceedings of the Courts of Judicature in the Province, both civil and criminal, have been founded ever &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing it) and likewi&s;e the Directions con|tained in the King's Commi&s;&s;ion to the Chief-Ju&s;tice, are void and of no Authority, and none of the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are now in Force in this Province, but the <HI>French</HI> Laws that prevailed here be|fore the Conque&s;t are the only Laws that are really &s;till in Force (as they certainly would have been if this Ordinance had not been made) or it mu&s;t be allowed that this excellent and beneficial Law, called the <HI>Coventry-Act,</HI> was introduced here by that Ordinance, to|gether with all the otter Laws of <HI>England</HI> in Being at the Time of pa&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Opinion, that the Injury done to Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> does not come within the <HI>Coventry-Act,</HI> though not &s;o intirely de&s;titute of all Colour of Rea&s;on as the former Opinion, will yet, I believe, upon Examination appear to be ill-grounded. The <HI>Coventry-Act</HI> &s;ays, that, whoever &s;hall on purpo&s;e, and of Malice-aforethought, cut or di&s;able the Tongue, put out an Eye, &s;lit the No&s;e, cut off a no&s;e or Lip, or cut off or di&s;able any Limb, or Member, of any Subject, with In|tention in &s;o doing to maim or disfigure him, &s;hall be guilty of Felo|ny without Benefit of Clergy. The&s;e are the Words of the Act, in which it is certain the Cutting off an Ear is not mentioned. But Gentlemen, is it not plainly comprehended within the Word <HI>Mem|ber?</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="010958_0012_0F852F2ECFB85678">
To what Purpo&s;e, after enumerating the &s;everal Features of the Face, does the Statute add the Words <HI>Limb or Member,</HI> unle&s;s it be to extend its Protection to all the other Organs of the Body by u&s;ing the mo&s;t general and comprehen&s;ive Words the Language affords. Certainly by the Word <HI>Limb</HI> we mu&s;t under&s;tand the lar|ger Parts of the human Body that are &s;eperate from the Trunk, namely, the Arms and Legs, and perhaps the Hands and Feet, and by the Word <HI>Member</HI> the &s;maller Parts of it, &s;uch as the Fin|gers, and particularly the Ears, as being more likely to be the Object of a malicious Intention to disfigure by Rea&s;on of the Re&s;emblance of &s;uch an Injury to a di&s;graceful Puni&s;hment in &s;ome Ca&s;es in|flicted by the Law; which is the very Sort of Injury this Statute was intended to prevent.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this Act of Parliament has always been reckoned a mo&s;t excellent and &s;alutary Law. It was pa&s;&s;ed in Oppo&s;ition to the Court, as a Law of inde&s;pen&s;able Importance, in the peaceable Part of the Reign of King CEAELES the II. in Con&s;equence of a ba&s;e piece of Cruelty committed upon Sir <HI>John Coventry,</HI> a Member of Parliament at that Time, by a&s;&s;aulting him in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park, and &s;litting his No&s;trils. This was done, as it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, at the In&s;tigation of the Court, and probably of the King him&s;elf, in Revenge for &s;ome light Expre&s;&s;ions thrown out By Sir <HI>John Coventry,</HI> in a Debate in Parliament, reflecting on the King's known Debauchery. Yet notwith&s;tanding the Provocation given by this per&s;onal Reflection on the King, the Parliament thought this barbarous A&s;&s;ault &s;uch a flagrant Violation of all the Rules of Ju&s;tice and Humanity, that they immediately prepared a Bill to ren|der the Perpetrators of it incapable of receiving the King's Pardon, and to make all future Offenders in the like Kind liable to be puni&s;hed with Death; and to this Bill the King gave the Royal A&s;|&s;ent. And it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the Parliament that did this was not a factious ill-di&s;po&s;ed Parliament, that took a Plea&s;ure in propo&s;ing Things that might be di&s;gu&s;tful to the Court; but it was that Parliament which, of all that ever &s;at in <HI>England,</HI> was mo&s;t devoted to the Crown, and di&s;po&s;ed to concur in almo&s;t every Mo|tion and Propo&s;ition that came from it&mdash;which had repeatedly &s;upplied that King with large Sums of Money, notwith&s;tanding the continual Wa&s;te and Mi&s;application of them, and which, to gratify the Pride and Revenge of his fir&s;t Mini&s;ter, the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> and the re&s;t of the vindictive Royali&s;ts that had returned from Ex|ile, had pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal penal Laws (which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t) to pro&s;ecute the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, had repealed the excellent Act obtained with &s;o much Difficulty from CHARLES the I. for &s;ecuring to the Nation a Meeting of Parliament at lea&s;t once in three Years, and had almo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed pa&s;&s;ive Obedience by a Law. Yet even this compliant Parliament thought this a nece&s;&s;ary Law&mdash;&s;o nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="23" REF="010958_0012_0F852F2ECFB85678">
as to in&s;i&s;t upon the pa&s;&s;ing it in Oppo&s;ition to the Wi&s;hes of the Court. And ever &s;ince that Time it has met with the univer&s;al Ap|probation of all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, and has received &s;o much Countenance from the Judges, and been deemed &s;o highly remedial and beneficial to the Subject, that in the only two Ca&s;es that have happened upon it (one of which happened about a Year and a Half ago, and the other was the well known Ca&s;e of <HI>Cook</HI> and <HI>Woodburn</HI>) it has met with a large and liberal Con&s;truction. This I am &s;ure of, that neither of tho&s;e Ca&s;es comes &s;o clearly within the Spirit and Meaning of the <HI>Coventry-Act</HI> as the Ca&s;e now before you does, which &s;eems indeed to be the very Sort of Outrage that Act was de&s;igned to guard again&s;t: And it &s;eems likewi&s;e to come within the Letter of it by giving the Word <HI>Member</HI> u&s;ed in the Statute, that, I will not &s;ay, liberal, but natural Interpretation that has been already mentioned. But the&s;e Con&s;iderations will, as I apprehend, become of little Con&s;equence by the &s;trong Proofs by which, I doubt not, you will be convinced that at the Time of committing the A&s;&s;ault the Ruffians who committing it had an Intention to murder Mr. <HI>Walker.</HI> I will now, Gentlemen, call the Witne&s;&s;es for the Crown in Support of this Indictment, without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing any longer on your Patience.</P>

<P>ON the &s;ixth Day of <HI>Decem|ber,</HI> about Half after Eight or near Nine of the Clock Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> looked at her Watch, and in about fifteen Minutes after were called out to Supper; as we were &s;itting at Supper, I with my Back to the Street Door, heard a Noi&s;e at the Latch, like &s;omebody wanting to come in in a Hurry, on which Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> being at the Head of the Table, &s;aid, <HI>entrez;</HI> the outward Door was thrown open, and through the inner Gla&s;s Door I &s;aw a great Number of People di&s;gui&s;ed, their Heads ap|peared one above another as they &s;tood on the Steps (&s;uch as tho&s;e in Court, pointing to a Number of People) They were di&s;gui&s;ed many different Ways, &s;ome of them little round Hats, others black Faces, others with Crapes, and one with a <HI>Tuck</HI> of the Hair over the Cap and turn'd in at Top; they bur&s;t the inner Door coming in, and broke the Gla&s;s, forcing the Bolts of the Door; I turned my Head round on Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI>'s &s;aying, <HI>Good God, what's this, This is Murder!</HI> I took &s;o much Notice of two Faces that were black'd that I &s;hould know them if I was to &s;ee them again; but they were not any of tho&s;e Gentlemen in

Cu&s;tody; have the Idea of them as of a Face drawn with a Pencil; had a di&s;tinct View of them. Many of them &s;urrounded as if they would cut off the Communi|cation of the Parlour. On turn|ing round. I received a Stroke on my Head. At that Time I could not tell whether it was a Broad Sword or Bludgeon. When I had received this Stroke I ro&s;e up and pa&s;&s;ed through them to get into the Parlour, in order to pa&s;s through it into my Bed-Room, where my Sword and Pi&s;tols were, in order to make &s;ome Defence. I then received many Blows (but cannot tell how many) Pa&s;&s;ing through the Parlour Door, they following me in &s;uch a Hurry, bur&s;t open the Standing-door (they were Folding-doors) being &s;o many of them. Coming to the further End of the Room, and &s;triving to get into my Bed-Room, two Men &s;tood at the Chamber Door, and fore-clo&s;ing me, pre|vented my opening it; beat me &s;o much, and with &s;uch a Number of Strokes. They clo&s;ed me round with a Curtain, which I &s;uppo&s;e prevented their Da&s;hing my Brains out. Was &s;ome Time in the Cor|ner, but how many Blows I re|ceived there, cannot tell. But there was Fifty-two Contu&s;ions or Brui&s;es. I was &s;welled from the Shoulders to the Fingers End, there was not a free Part all over my Body. I received a Wound on my Leg, but don't know when. Whil&s;t in the Corner I had no Remembrance of being off my Feet; but &s;eeing the Marks of my bloody Head again&s;t the Wall imagine I had lo&s;t my Sen&s;es; but remember hearing a Per&s;on &s;ay, <HI>let me come to him, I will di&s;patch the Villain with my Sword;</HI> this was the fir&s;t Thing I heard; and that rou&s;ed me, and then was de|termined to &s;ell my Life as dear as po&s;&s;ible. Having &s;een Major <HI>Di&s;ney,</HI> not knowing that I had ever di&s;obliged him, I expected Life, till I heard tho&s;e Words. Major <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> had a Crape on his Face, and I di&s;covered his Face through the Crape. Believe by the Figure that it was he that made u&s;e of tho&s;e Words, having &s;een him in the Room before I received &s;o many Blows, but I cannot &s;ay po&s;itively that I knew his Voice, and do not recollect particularly what Dre&s;s he was in. Before I received any Blows, or any Thing in the outward Room, I was ful|ly convinced that was Major <HI>Di&s;|ney.</HI> A Per&s;on made at me and I parried the Blow with my left Hand and &s;truck at him. At the In&s;tant the Words were pro|nounced two or three People came up to me with Swords levelled, but do not know whether any Body made a Pa&s;s at me or not, but upon my taking Courage they retreated back: My Eyes were then full of Blood. They then clo&s;ed; one collared me; I &s;eized and held him, till another took me by the right Thigh, and &s;trove to lift me and &s;et me on the Fire, I then turned my&s;elf round &s;etting my Hands again&s;t the Chim|ney (the Marks of my five bloody Fingers are on the Jambs of the Chimney) and tore the Side of my Shoe with the Force, and in turn|ing round I received a Stroke (which the Doctor &s;aid was that of a

Tomahawk) which fell'd me to the Ground, &s;en&s;ele&s;s; how long I laid there cannot tell. The fir&s;t Remembrance after that Stroke was a &s;evere Blow on my Loins, whether by a Tomahawke or Bludgeon, I do not know, but feel it to this Day in bad weather. After that Blow a Man kneel'd, or &s;at on my right Side, and I felt as if he was attempting to cut my Throat; I then moved my Head and Shoulders and put any Hand up, thinking it was his Thumb, but found a &s;harp In&s;tru|ment. And he cut the little Fin|ger of my left Hand to the Bone; and it was a Fortnight before I knew that I had lo&s;t my Ear. I thought they had aimed to cut my Throat, and thought (at the Time) they had done it. Af|ter receiving that Wound I heard a Voice from one of tho&s;e Peo|ple pre&s;ent &s;ay, <HI>the Villain's dead;</HI> another &s;aid, <HI>damn him, we have done for him.</HI> A third Per&s;on &s;poke, but I could not rightly under&s;tand what he &s;aid, but heard &s;ome Words; then having lo&s;t my Sen&s;|es can give no further Account; but when I did recollect found my|&s;elf in the Arms of <HI>William Fon|taine</HI> my Servant, and one Mr. <HI>Pi&s;tolet.</HI></P>

<HEAD>After the Pri&s;oner's Council had clo&s;ed the Evidence in his Defence, the Attorney-General made a Reply, to nearly the following Purport, but le&s;s fully and with le&s;s Warmth.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>'May it plea&s;e your Honour, and you Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I Beg leave to trouble you with a few Ob&s;ervations upon the Evi|dence that has been produced in the Pri&s;oner's Defence. This Defence &s;eems to con&s;i&s;ts of two Parts, The one is an Attempt to prove that the Pri&s;oner was engaged in Company at Dr. <HI>Robert&s;on</HI>'s Hou&s;e, during the Time of the A&s;&s;ault upon Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and con&s;equently that he could not be pre&s;ent at it; the other is an Endeavour to di&s;credit the Witne&s;s <HI>Magovock,</HI> by &s;ugge&s;ting that there are Contradictions in his Evidence, and making him pa&s;s for a Man of a bad general Cha|racter.&mdash;This, I think, is the Plan and Sub&s;tance of the Defence.</P>
<P>"As to the fir&s;t Part of this Defence, the Pre&s;ence of the Pri&s;oner, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> another Place, I mu&s;t begin by ob&s;erving, that it is always looked <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">on as the wor&s;t and weake&s;t Kind of Evidence that can be made u&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Defence of an accu&s;ed Per&s;on, and is &s;eldom allowed to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> any Weight in Oppo&s;ition to a po&s;itive Charge, &s;upported by witne&s;&s;es of Credit: And this for a very obvious Rea&s;on, becau&s;e it the ea&s;ie&s;t of any Sort of Evidence to be contrived by the Friends of
<PB N="54" REF="010958_0028_0F852F424F1F5A68">
the Pri&s;oner in order to &s;ave him, if they are Per&s;ons, as too often is the Ca&s;e, who&s;e Attachment to his Welfare will lead them to tran&s;|gre&s;s the Bounds of Truth in his Behalf. To make this Kind of Evi|dence in any Degree &s;atisfactory, it is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;everal &s;trong Circum&s;tances &s;hould concur. The Witne&s;&s;es, who te&s;tify the Pre|&s;ence of the Pri&s;oner at another Place at the Time of the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Crime, ought to be Per&s;ons of undoubted Credit, free from any Connections with the Pri&s;oner (whether of Kindred, or Friend|&s;hip, or Intere&s;t of any Kind) that may in the lead tend to bia&s;s them in his Favour; the Place at which they &s;aw him ought to be far di&s;|tant from that where the Crime was committed, &s;o far di&s;tant that it &s;hould be impo&s;&s;ible, or next to impo&s;&s;ible, for a Man to go from the one Place to the other in the Time between the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Crime and his being &s;een at the other place: This Place ought likewi&s;e to be a public Place, where People who have no per&s;onal Acquaintance with each other meet by Accident, and the Per&s;ons who atte&s;t the having &s;een him there &s;hould be Per&s;ons unconnected and unacquaint|ed with each other, as well as with the Pri&s;oner. This would be a Proof of an Alibi that would de&s;erve con&s;iderable Regard. Thus, if Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> had been proved to be at <HI>Quebec,</HI> which is 180 Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Montreal,</HI> at the Time of committing this A&s;&s;ault, or within a few Hours, or half a Day, of that Time&mdash;and this, not by one or two Friends, who &s;hould &s;ay that they &s;aw him there that Day in private, but by Witne&s;&s;es that had no particular Acquaintance with him, and who &s;hould te&s;tify that they &s;aw him at &s;ome public Place there, as, for Example, on the Parade exerci&s;ing the Soldiers, or on the Mar|ket-place, or at Dinner with a numerous Company at the Gover|nor's Table; and if the Witne&s;&s;es who had &s;worn this &s;hould likewi&s;e tell you to what Cau&s;e or particular Circum&s;tances it was owing that they could remember their having &s;een him there on the Day of this A&s;&s;ault, when they, probably, are not able to recollect on what Day they &s;aw him immediately before, or immediately after, it&mdash; Such a Te&s;timony would really be important, and might perhaps de&s;erve to be &s;et in Oppo&s;ition to the po&s;itive Evidence of the Wit|ne&s;&s;es in Support of the Charge.&mdash;But how different from this is the Alibi Evidence that you have heard! Three Ladies, and Dr. <HI>Robert&s;on,</HI> have told you that Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> &s;pent the Afternoon and Evening with them a Dr. <HI>Robert&s;on</HI>'s Hou&s;e in <HI>Montreal,</HI> not two Hundred Yards di&s;tant from Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Hou&s;e. Two of tho&s;e La|dies Mrs. <HI>Howard</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Campbell,</HI> are the Wives of two of the Pri&s;oners now in Cu&s;tody for this Affair; and the latter is likewi&s;e the Daughter of another of tho&s;e Pri&s;oners. The other Lady, Mrs. <HI>Landrieves,</HI> is a very intimate Acquaintance and Friend of Capt. <HI>Di&s;|ney</HI>'s. And Dr. <HI>Robert&s;on</HI> has given &s;trong Proofs of his eager De|&s;ire to get both this and all the other Pri&s;oners for this Affair di&s;char|ged, and has gone much greater Lengths for this Purpo&s;e than the

<P>'Gentlemen, the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es have not told to you to what particu|lar Circum&s;tance it is owing that they remember &s;o exactly the Man|ner in which they &s;pent their Time on the 6th of <HI>December,</HI> 1764; without which it mu&s;t needs appear &s;trange that they &s;hould remem|ber it &s;o exactly. Can they tell where and in what Company, and in what Manner they &s;pent their Time on the 6th of <HI>December,</HI> 1765, or even on the 6th of la&s;t <HI>December,</HI> though only three Months pa&s;t? &mdash;Or can you, Gentlemen, tho&s;e of you that were then in <HI>Montreal,</HI> remember di&s;tinctly where and how you &s;pent your Afternoon and Evening on that very &s;ame 6th of <HI>December,</HI> 1764? If you cannot, is it not &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ing that the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es &s;hould be able to do it &s;o exactly, without &s;ome particular Circum&s;tance to induce them to take Notice at the Time, or &s;oon after, of the Manner in which they &s;pent that Day? This Circum&s;tance I &s;hould have been glad to be informed of.&mdash;Was it that they &s;u&s;pected that Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> or Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> or Captain <HI>Campbell,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Simon Evans,</HI> or any other Per&s;on in that Company at Dr. <HI>Robert&s;on</HI>'s, would ever be ac|cu&s;ed or que&s;tioned about this A&s;&s;ault upon Mr. <HI>Walker?</HI>&mdash; Such an early Su&s;picion, Gentlemen, would, in my Opinion, have been no &s;mall Pre&s;umption that &s;ome of that Company were guilty of it.&mdash;What other Conjecture to form concerning the Cau&s;e of their remembering &s;o well the Manner and Company in which they &s;pent that Day I know not.&mdash;'Tis certain they have help'd us to no other.</P>
<P>'But Gentlemen, other Things in their Evidence afford Matter of Surpri&s;e. They not only remember of what Per&s;ons the Company con&s;i&s;ted, and how they &s;pent their Time, but declare that they are confident that Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> was pre&s;ent in the Company during the whole Time that each of them&s;elves was pre&s;ent there, though that Time was near five Hours.</P>
<P>'Gentlemen, this bold A&s;&s;ertion de&s;erves to be examined, in or|der
<PB N="56" REF="010958_0029_0F852F45E2F5D828">
that you may fully under&s;tand it, and a&s;&s;ign to it its proper De|gree of Credit, which I believe you will judge to be but little. It may be under&s;tood in two different Sen&s;es: It may mean either that the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es in their Eyes continually fixed upon Captain <HI>Di&s;ney,</HI> &s;o that he never was out of their Sight and Ob&s;ervation during the whole five hours, which would indeed be a po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertion ab&s;olutely in|con&s;i&s;tent with the Charge; or it may mean that they did not indeed keep the Pri&s;oner continually in their Sight during that whole Time, but only that they &s;aw him there at &s;everal different Times during their being together, and that they did not mi&s;s him or ob&s;erve that he quitted the Company during that whole Time; and therefore that they, by Inference, conclude that he did not quit it, becau&s;e, if he had done &s;o, they think it highly probable that they mu&s;t have taken Notice of it.&mdash;'Tis in this latter Sen&s;e the Evidence of the&s;e Witne&s;|&s;es, mu&s;t be taken: The other is too bold, or rather de&s;perate, a Kind of Evidence for any People to deliver in a Court of Ju&s;tice with any Expectation of being believed: And accordingly you mu&s;t have ob|&s;erved, Gentlemen, that when the fir&s;t Witne&s;s was a&s;ked whether &s;he had her Eyes fixt continually upon Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> during the whole Time (which &s;he mu&s;t have &s;aid if &s;he had meant po&s;itively to af|firm that he was there the whole Time) &s;he readily an&s;wered that &s;he did not keep her Eyes thus continually fixed upon him, but that &s;he &s;aw him there very often, and never ob&s;erved that he left the Com|pany, which &s;he &s;ays &s;he could not but have done if he had ever left them, becau&s;e the Company was but &s;mall: And the other Wit|ne&s;&s;es an&s;wered in the &s;ame Manner. Now this is not a po&s;itive A&s;|&s;ertion that Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> was there all the Time: It is only a ne|gative Propo&s;ition, or a Declaration that they did not ob&s;erve him to leave the Company in all that Time, which is a very different Thing. For, Gentlemen. This Declaration, that they never ob&s;erv|ed him leave the Company, may be true, and yet the Inference they would draw from it, that he never left it, may not be &s;o: He may have left the Company more than once, and they not have ob&s;erved it, e&s;pecially for &s;o &s;mall a Time as five or &s;ix Minutes, which is &s;uf|ficient for his attending a Tran&s;action that happened only at the Di&s;|tance of Two Hundred Yards from the Place where the Company was a&s;&s;embled, And therefore, Gentlemen, the Evidence of the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be &s;trictly true, does not po&s;itively prove the Pri&s;oner's Alibi, but only gives Room for a probable Inference in Support of it, which being but a Pre&s;umption, ought not to be &s;et in Oppo&s;ition to the po&s;itive Te&s;timony of three Witne&s;&s;es in Support of the Charge again&s;t him.</P>
<P>'But, Gentlemen, we may go &s;till further. This Evidence of the Pri&s;oner's Alibi is not even a <HI>very &s;trong</HI> Pre&s;umption. For where is the great Improbability of a Per&s;on's ab&s;enting him&s;elf once or twice from a Company of eleven Per&s;ons (which was the Number
<PB N="57" REF="010958_0029_0F852F45E2F5D828">
a&s;&s;embled at Dr. <HI>Robert&s;on</HI>'s) for a &s;hort &s;pace of Time, &s;uch as five or ten Minutes, without being ob&s;erved by the other Per&s;ons in the Com|pany, and that too with &s;uch particular Attention that they &s;hall be able to recollect it a long Time after?&mdash;Such a Want of Ob|&s;ervation of the Motions of the re&s;t of the Company, as not to recollect &s;uch little Ab&s;ences of &s;ome one of them, is &s;urely by no Means un|common. Gentlemen, I appeal to your&s;elves, whether when you happen to be in a Company of a Dozen People for five Hours together, who are met together for the Sake of Mirth and Amu&s;ement, you are apt to watch each Per&s;on in the Company &s;o very carefully that you can fal&s;ely declare afterwards, upon Oath, which of them ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the Company for a little While, and which did not, and can be &s;ure that during the whole Time &s;uch or &s;uch a particu|lar Per&s;on of the Company never left it, even for the Space of five or ten Minutes? Gentlemen, is it your Cu&s;tom to watch your Company &s;o narrowly: I believe I may &s;ay that it is not.&mdash;And in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;ent Ca&s;e is not the Difficulty of ob&s;erving and remembering <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Particulars increa&s;ed by the Variety of Pa&s;times with which this Com|pany amu&s;ed them&s;elves?&mdash;They were not all the while en|gaged in Parties at Cards, or in dancing, in which Ca&s;e they might perhaps ob&s;erve what became of their Partners and the others engaged at play with them: But they &s;pent Part of the Time in making Syrup, Part of it in dancing, Part of it drinking Tea, and Part of it, Gentle|men (which is worthy your Attention) in playing at Blind-man's-buff. Can they be &s;uppo&s;ed, during all tho&s;e different Amu&s;ements to have been &s;o very watchful of each other? They &s;hould at lea&s;t have ex|cepted tho&s;e parts of the Time they were playing at Blind-man's-buff, during which they acted the part of the blind-Man.</P>
<P>'Gentlemen, I could not but admire the Rapidity and the Po&s;itivene&s;s with which &s;ome of the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es delivered their Evidence, particu|larly the fir&s;t Witne&s;s. The An&s;wer was ready almo&s;t before the Que&s;tion was pronounced. I believe &s;he never repeated her Creed or her Catechi&s;m more readily or nimbly. She told you the exact Times at which each different Amu&s;ement began, as readily and preci&s;ely as if &s;he had been reading an Account of them from Minutes of that Af|ternoon's Entertainment taken down at the Time. One Thing only e&s;caped her uncommon Memory, till &s;he was induced to reccollect it, by a po&s;itive Que&s;tion put to her concerning it. This was that &s;he her&s;elf was ab&s;ent from the Company for Part of the Time this Com|pany has been &s;aid to continue together. Gentlemen, this Circum|&s;tance &s;he forgot to tell you in her original Account: it was drawn from her in the Cro&s;s-examination. But when &s;he did declare it, I make no Doubt, Gentlemen, that you ob&s;erved the great Importance of it. Gentlemen, it tends to nothing le&s;s than to make her Evidence and that of Mrs. <HI>Howard</HI> (who was ab&s;ent with her for that little Time) I &s;ay, it tends to nothing le&s;s than to make the Evidence of both the&s;e
<PB N="58" REF="010958_0030_0F852F4693686A10">
Witne&s;&s;es (admitting it all to be &s;trictly true) of little or no Effect in &s;upporting the Pri&s;oner's Alibi. For ob&s;erve only the Time of this Ab&s;ence. This Witne&s;s and Mrs. <HI>Howard</HI> have both of them told you that it happend about three Quarters of an Hour after Eight o'Clock, that is, as near as can be judged, at the very Time of the A&s;&s;ault com|mitted upon Mr. <HI>Walker.</HI> Ju&s;t at this critical Time they left the Com|pany and went to Mrs. <HI>Howard</HI>'s Hou&s;e for a Table-Cloth, leaving the Company employed in no common Amu&s;ement, &s;uch as Cards or Dancing, that might require the Pre&s;ence of them all, but fitting round the Stove till the Supper &s;hould be ready: They &s;taid away &s;ome little Time, which they think was about five Minutes, and then returned to Dr. <HI>Robert&s;on</HI>'s. Gentlemen, this Time of their Ab&s;ence may not improbably be a good deal more than five Minutes&mdash;per|haps a Quarter of an Hour, or twenty Minutes. Such Mi&s;takes in the Mea&s;ure of Time happen every Day, where People judge of it without looking at a Watch, as the&s;e Ladies have declared that they did.</P>
<P>'In this &s;mall Space of Time it was po&s;&s;ible, for aught that is con|tained in the Evidence of the&s;e two Ladies, for Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> to have have quitted the Company and &s;tept Home to his Lodging, and, there making the little Alteration in his Dre&s;s which was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;gui&s;e him, to have gone into Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and been pre&s;ent for two or three Minutes during the A&s;&s;ault upon him, to overlook and encourage the Per&s;ons employed in it. The change of Dre&s;s for this Purpo&s;e would take up a very &s;hort Time. It was only throwing off his Coat, and flipping on a <HI>Canadian</HI> Gown in&s;tead of it, and put|ting a Crape over his Face and a cut-round Hat upon his Head with the Crape tucked in under it. This was the only Change made in his Dre&s;s from that in which he appeared at Dr, <HI>Robert&s;on</HI>'s: For the Pri|&s;oner's Witne&s;&s;es have told you that he was that Day dre&s;&s;ed in Scarlet and Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> ob&s;erved that he had a red Wai&s;tcoat and red Breeches under his <HI>Canadian</HI> Gown.</P>
<P>'This &s;light Change of his Dre&s;s he might ea&s;ily make, and be pre&s;ent at Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Hou&s;e, for a few Minutes, then change his Dre&s;s again and return to Dr. <HI>Robert&s;on</HI>'s, in the Compa&s;s of a very &s;mall Time. We may therefore con&s;ider the Evidence of tho&s;e two Ladies as contributing very little to &s;upport the Pri&s;oner's Alibi. It it mu&s;t therefore re&s;t principally upon the Te&s;timony of Mrs. <HI>Campbell,</HI> a Lady that is the Wife of one, and the Daughter of another of the Pri&s;oner's now in Cu&s;tody for this A&s;&s;ault, and that of the very friendly Dr. <HI>Robert&s;on,</HI> who&s;e Zeal in the Defence of the&s;e Gentlemen has been &s;o great as to lead him to take Depo&s;itions concerning this Affair, even &s;ince the Chief-Ju&s;tice has been here in Town to hold this Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Such, Gentlemen, is the Alibi to which you are de&s;ired to give Credit: An Alibi declaring the Pri&s;oner to have been at a Place not Two Hundred Yards di&s;tant from the Scene of the Offence. Pretended to
<PB N="59" REF="010958_0030_0F852F4693686A10">
be proved by four Witne&s;&s;es, but in Truth not po&s;itively proved by any one of them, (none of them &s;wearing that they had the Pri&s;oner con|tinually in Sight during the whole Time they were together) but grounded upon a Pre&s;umption only, and not a very &s;trong one, that, if he had quitted the Room, though for a very &s;mall Space of Time, as five or ten Minutes, during any Part of the five Fours they were toge|ther, they mu&s;t have taken Notice of it.&mdash;And even this poor Pre&s;umption is found, upon a Cro&s;s-Examination, to be &s;upported by only two of the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, the other two having confe&s;&s;ed that they them&s;elves were ab&s;ent from the Company for a little Time, ju&s;t at the critical Juncture of the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Crime&mdash;And this Proof, imperfect as it is, made by Witne&s;&s;es under a &s;trong and evi|dent Bia&s;s in the Pri&s;oner's Favour. This wretched Alibi you are re|quired to believe in oppo&s;ition to the po&s;itive Te&s;timony of three Wit|ne&s;&s;es, two of whom are Per&s;ons of unblemi&s;hed Character, and per|fectly free from Prejudice again&s;t the Pri&s;oner, and the third was an Accomplice in the Fact. You cannot, Gentlemen, remain long in Doubt which of the&s;e two Te&s;timonies to prefer.</P>
<P>'Gentlemen, I have &s;aid that Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> are perfectly free from Prejudice again&s;t the Pri&s;oner. I will explain what I mean by that A&s;&s;ertion. It cannot be pretended that they are free from Re&s;entment again&s;t the Pri&s;oner: They mu&s;t be exempt from human Pa&s;&s;ions if they were: But their Re&s;entment ari&s;es merely from this very Injury with which he is now charged, and from their own certain Knowledge of his concern in it. That, and the Pri&s;oner's Declaration before-hand, That he would be revenged upon Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> for his Ill-treatment of Captain <HI>Payne,</HI> are the only Grounds that Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> has for any Re&s;entment again&s;t Captain <HI>Di&s;ney.</HI> And &s;uch a Re&s;ent|ment cannot be called a Prejudice again&s;t Captain <HI>Di&s;ney,</HI> or in any Degree affect the Credibility of Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Evidence or this Occa&s;ion, becau&s;e the very Exi&s;tence of &s;uch a Re&s;entment &s;uppo&s;es nece&s;&s;arily that of the Crime with which the Pri&s;oner &s;tands charged as the Cau&s;e and Ground of it. It might indeed affect Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Evidence on any other Pro&s;ecution again&s;t Captain <HI>Di&s;ney,</HI> either for an Injury done to another Man, or for another Injury done to him&s;elf: But in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e it cannot have any &s;uch Effect. Till this unhappy Vio|lence, or a very little Time before it, Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> and Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> had lived upon good Terms with each other. Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> him&s;elf has informed you that he did &s;o: He has declared that he always en|tertained a Re&s;pect for Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> (that, I think, was his Expre&s;&s;ion) and expre&s;&s;ed it in Cover&s;ation whenever he had Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of him: And he has called a Witne&s;s to prove that he did &s;o. And Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> has told you that he tru&s;ted &s;o much to the Profe&s;&s;ions of Re|gard that Captain <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> had often made him, and was &s;o con&s;cious in his own Mind of his never having given him any Cau&s;e of Offence, that, when he di&s;tingui&s;hed him among the di&s;gui&s;ed Ruffians that
<PB N="60" REF="010958_0031_0F852F4799BE6888">
were come to a&s;&s;aut him, he was encouraged by the Sight of him to hope that his Life was not in Danger, and that the Mi&s;chief intended him was only a &s;evere Beating, or Wounding, or &s;omething &s;hort of Death, in Revenge for the imaginary In&s;ult upon Captain <HI>Payne,</HI> till he was forced to think otherwi&s;e by tho&s;e dreadful and murderous Words, pronounced from the oppo&s;ite Corner of the Room by the Man who advanced again&s;t him with a drawn Sword, <HI>Damn him, let me come to him, and I'll di&s;patch him with my Sword.</HI></P>
<P>'Gentlemen, this Evidence of Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker,</HI> appears to me to be &s;o weighty, that' if the Alibi Defence of the Pri&s;oner had been &s;upported by po&s;itive Evidence ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with the Charge &mdash;if not two only, but all the four Witne&s;&s;es had po&s;itively &s;worn, that at eight o'Clock exactly they had &s;at down to play at Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> with the Pri&s;oner, and that they had never left the Table till the Me&s;|&s;enger came from General <HI>Burton</HI> with the News of the Outrage com|mitted upon Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> but had been all the While either at the Table playing them&s;elves, or near it, looking on upon tho&s;e who did play, and that the Pri&s;oner had never cut out, but had been one of the Players during the whole of that Time, &s;o that he mu&s;t have been con|tinually before their Eyes.&mdash;and if the Per&s;ons who te&s;tified this had not been the intimate Friends of the Pri&s;oner, or the Wives and Daughters of the other Pri&s;oners, but Per&s;ons entirely unconnected, and very little acquainted, with them&mdash;I &s;ay, Gentlemen, that is the alibi Defence of the Pri&s;oner had been &s;upported by &s;uch a po&s;i|tive Te&s;timony in&s;tead of the imperfect and precarious Evidence which you have heard, yet &s;till the Evidence in Support of the Charge would de&s;erve to be preferred to it.&mdash;This may, at fir&s;t Sight, &s;eem a har&s;h Po&s;ition: But it will be found upon Examination to be built upon a Principle of Candour and Charity, which directs us to think as fa|vourable of human Nature as the Circum&s;tances of the Ca&s;e will per|mit us. Gentlemen, it would be a bad Dilemma for you to be reduced to, if you were really under a Nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;believing the Witne&s;&s;es on one Side or other, and con&s;equently of &s;uppo&s;ing tho&s;e on one of the Sides to be guilty of wilful Perjury. But if you were reduced to this Dilemma, to which Side would a moderately good Opinion of human induce you to impute the Perjury? To tho&s;e who give Evidence to take away the Pri&s;oner's life or to tho&s;e who give Evidence to &s;ave it? Is it not more natural that Men &s;hould commit Perjury to re&s;cue a Man from Danger than in order to effect his De&s;truction? In the former Ca&s;e they may think perhaps that the Benevolence of the Intention with which they commit this Crime may &s;omewhat extenuate the Guilt of it; in the latter Ca&s;e they mu&s;t feel that the Guilt of the Perjury is aggravated an Hundred-fold by the Wickedne&s;s of the Intention with with it is committed. The former is a Crime which Men of loo&s;e Principles may be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of committing, and which indeed is very frequently committed; the latter is a Crime too black for even
<PB N="61" REF="010958_0031_0F852F4799BE6888">
wicked Men, and &s;eldom or never known to have been practi&s;ed.&mdash; But, Gentlemen, you are fortunately not reduced to this Dilemma, &s;ince the Evidence advanced in the Pri&s;oner's Favour has been &s;hewn to be not irreconcileable with the Evidence in &s;upport of the Charge. The Pri&s;oner may have &s;pent that Evening in the Company of his three fair Witne&s;&s;es, and yet have been ab&s;ent for a &s;hort Time to partake in the Revenge taken again&s;t Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> without being mi&s;&s;ed by them.</P>
<P>'Gentlemen, that the Pri&s;oner &s;pent that Evening either in the Company at Dr. <HI>Robert&s;on</HI>'s, or in &s;ome other numerous Company. I think is highly probable. I &s;hould have imagined he had done &s;o if he had produced no Witne&s;&s;es to prove it: For it is but a rea&s;onable Precaution for any Man to take, who intends to be concerned in any dangerous Tran&s;action, for which he may afterwards come to be que&s;|tioned. He thereby furni&s;hes him&s;elf with a ready Defence again&s;t any Accu&s;ation of having been engaged in it that happens to be made in a loo&s;e and general Manner, without narrowly enquiring into Circum|&s;tances. How can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, will he &s;ay, that I was pre&s;ent at &s;uch a Tran&s;action, when &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons can te&s;tify that much about the Time at which it happened, or at lea&s;t not above half an Hour or an Hour, before or after it, I was in their Company, employed in Dancing or &s;ome other &s;uch innocent Amu&s;ement." &s;uch a Defence will do very well to an&s;wer the Su&s;picions and Hints thrown out again&s;t him in common Conver&s;ation, and will pa&s;s with many People for a full Ju&s;tification; and, perhaps, with a little Improvement (if the Witne&s;&s;es are well di&s;po&s;ed towards the Pri&s;oner) by varying the Time and other Circum&s;tances in the Manner requi&s;ite, it may meet with Credit even in a Court of Ju&s;tice; whereas, if he had &s;pent his Time at Home in a &s;olitary Manner till the Time of committing the Crime, he could have nothing of this Kind to &s;et up in Oppo&s;ition to the Te&s;|timony in &s;upport of the Charge again&s;t him.</P>
<P>'The&s;e, Gentlemen, are the Ob&s;ervations I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to offer to you concerning this boa&s;ted Evidence of the Pri&s;oner's Alibi, which makes the principal Part of his Defence. I am &s;en&s;ible they have taken up too much of your Time; but I knew not how to make them &s;horter. I hope therefore you will excu&s;e this Prolixity, and at the &s;ame Time will further indulge me with leave to make a few Remarks on the &s;econd Part of the Pri&s;oner's Defence, which con&s;i&s;ts in an En|deavour to di&s;credit the Witne&s;s <HI>Magovock.</HI></P>
<P>'Gentlemen, it is of no great Con&s;equence in the pre&s;ent Pro&s;ecu|tion what Degree of Credit this Witne&s;s de&s;erves, as the Change is &s;up|ported by two Witne&s;&s;es of indi&s;putable Credit without him. However, I can &s;ee no Rea&s;on for treating his Evidence with the Contempt which the Gentlemen of Council with the Pri&s;oner have affected to &s;hew for it. He certainly is not a good Man: No Body has pretended that he was &s;o. He owns that he was an Accomplice in this wicked Action, which no good Man could be concerned in: And Lieutenant <HI>Ma Kay</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="010958_0032_0F852F484EB32F00">
has &s;aid, that, when he knew him in the Army, he was &s;ometimes guilty of Theft, and has been puni&s;hed for it by a Court Martial. I readily believe this. But does this render what he &s;ays as a Witne&s;s in a Court Ju&s;tice of no Weight or Con&s;equence? Does it follow, be|cau&s;e a Soldier has been guilty of Theft, a Crime too common among&s;t them, that therefore he will be guilty of the great and deliberate Crime (one of the mo&s;t heinous that can be committed) of &s;wearing fal&s;ely in a Court of Ju&s;tice to take away another Man's Life? Surely it does not: And the Law, Gentlemen, in the Ca&s;e of Accomplices deter|mines that it does not: For it allows their Evidence to be received again&s;t their Fellow-criminals, nay, to be alone the Ground of a Con|viction, without any other po&s;itive Te&s;timony, provided there is &s;ome concomitant Evidence ari&s;ing from Circum&s;tances to make it probable. Numbers of People have been condemned upon &s;uch Evidence, and with the general Approbation of all the World: And there are now in <HI>Quebec</HI> Goal two Soldier under Sentence of Death, for breaking open Mr <HI>Wool&s;ey</HI>'s Cellar in the Night Time, and &s;tealing a Ca&s;k of Wine from it, who were convicted upon the &s;ingle Te&s;timony of an Accomplice with them in the Fact, together with a Proof by Mr. <HI>Wool&s;ey</HI> and his Clerk that the Cellar had been broke open by &s;ome|body or other and the Wine taken away. How much more then does &s;uch a Te&s;timony de&s;erve to be regarded when it does not &s;tand &s;ingle, but is made u&s;e of only to confirm the po&s;itive Te&s;timony of two other Witne&s;&s;es of indi&s;putable Credit, which is the Ca&s;e with the Evidence of this Witne&s;s on the pre&s;ent Pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>'Gentlemen, the Credibility of a Witne&s;&s;es Te&s;timony does not de|pend merely upon the Goodne&s;s of his Character. The Probility of the Story he relates, the Agreement of it with other well-known Facts, the Minutene&s;s and Particularity of the Circum&s;tances he mentions; and his Illiteratene&s;s and Ignorance and utter Incapacity to invent them, if he was wicked enough to endeavour to do &s;o, may make his Evidence de&s;erve to be believed by tho&s;e who have no Oppinion of his Virtue. The&s;e, I pre&s;ume, are &s;ome of the Grounds upon which the Law ad|mits the Evidence of Accomplices, and allows it to have con&s;iderable Weight: And the&s;e are the Grounds upon which the Evidence of this Witne&s;s <HI>Magovock</HI> de&s;erves to be regarded. Gentlemen, can you &s;up|po&s;e this Witne&s;s, who can neither write nor read,&mdash;I &s;ay, can you &s;uppo&s;e him capable of inventing &s;o long and particular a Story as he has related to you, and which is attended with &s;ome Circum&s;tances &s;o uncommon and &s;urpri&s;ing? Is it likely that he &s;hould think of &s;o remarkable a Circum&s;tance as that of the Con&s;ultation at Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI>'s Hou&s;e on the Monday preceding the A&s;&s;ault, in which the Pri&s;oner at the Bar admini&s;tred to him the Oath of Secrecy, unle&s;s the&s;e Things had really happened? Would he have refu&s;ed to deliver his whole Evidence about this Matter at once in his fir&s;t Depo&s;ition, if he had not been under the Re&s;traint of &s;uch an Oath? Is there any Rea&s;on to
<PB N="63" REF="010958_0032_0F852F484EB32F00">
&s;uppo&s;e that he is &s;o refined and ingenious a Villain, as to able to invent &s;uch a Story about an Oath of Secrecy, merely to make him&s;elf pa&s;s for a Man of &s;ome Con&s;cience, and give Credit to the re&s;t of his Evidence? I cannot, for my Part, have either &s;o bad an Opinion of his Heart, or &s;o good an one of his Under&s;tanding, as to &s;uppo&s;e this: His Te&s;timony therefore de&s;erves the &s;ame Degree of Credit as is u&s;ually given to the Evidence of Accomplices, notwith&s;tanding the Endeavours that have been u&s;ed to a&s;per&s;e his general Character. It remains that I make a few Remarks upon the Evidence he has delivered at this Trial, and the Incon&s;i&s;tencies which the Gentlemen of Coun&s;el for the Pri&s;oner have ob&s;erved between the different Parts of it, and between &s;ome Parts of it and the Evidence of &s;ome of the other Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>'One of the&s;e Contradictions is, that he &s;aid in his Cro&s;s-Exami|nation that he carried the Intelligence concerning the Progre&s;s of the A&s;&s;ault upon Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> to Captain <HI>Payne</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> at Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s Hou&s;e, whereas he had before &s;aid that Captain <HI>Payne</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> were, during that A&s;&s;ault, &s;tanding in the Street in which Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Hou&s;e is &s;ituated, near the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Bellair,</HI> a Baker, which is almo&s;t directly over-again&s;t Mr. <HI>Wal|ker</HI>'s Hou&s;e. Gentlemen, I doubt not you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved that this Mi&s;take was never made by the Witne&s;s, but by the Coun&s;el that cro&s;s-examined him, who, throughout the whole Cro&s;s-examination, en|deavoured to confound the Witne&s;s and bewilder his Under&s;tanding, by a&s;king him a Variety of Que&s;tions unconnected with each other and without any Method or Regard to the Order of Time, with a View to draw him in to make &s;udden An&s;wers that might not be confident with each other. But in this he was di&s;appointed by the Steadine&s;s and Clearne&s;s with which the Witne&s;s gave his An&s;wers to all the Que&s;tions that were put to him. With Re&s;pect to the pretended Contradiction now under Con&s;ideration, the Witne&s;s's Evidence was really as fol|lows: The Pri&s;oner's Coun&s;el had a&s;ked him whether he had &s;een Captain <HI>Payne</HI> before he went into Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Hou&s;e, to commit the A&s;&s;ault; to which the Witne&s;s an&s;wered that he had &s;een him before at Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and that they had come out from thence at the &s;ame Time. After another Que&s;tion or two, the Coun&s;el a&s;ks him where it was he carried the Intelligence concerning the Progre&s;s of the A&s;&s;ault to Captain <HI>Payne</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham;</HI> and the Witne&s;s an&s;wers, in the Street near Mr. <HI>Bellair</HI>'s Hou&s;e, which is al|mo&s;t over-again&s;t Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s. Thereupon the Coun&s;el pretends that this is incon&s;i&s;tent with his former An&s;wer; for that in that he had declared that he had carried the Intelligence concerning the A&s;&s;ault to Captain <HI>Payne</HI> at Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s Hou&s;e. But the Witne&s;s immedi|ately an&s;wered, that the Coun&s;el had greatly mi&s;taken him; for that he had never &s;aid any &s;uch Thing, but only that he had &s;een Captain <HI>Payne</HI> before at Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and that Captain <HI>Payne</HI> had &s;et out with them from that Hou&s;e: And this, Gentlemen, I dare &s;ay
<PB N="64" REF="010958_0033_0F852F4F98983420">
you ob&s;erved to have been really his Evidence. Indeed this is a Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">+take which it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e he could have made, unle&s;s he had been quite a Stranger to <HI>Montreal;</HI> becau&s;e otherwi&s;e he could <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> know that Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s Hou&s;e was at too great a Di&s;tance from Mr <HI>Walker</HI>'s for a man to have gone thither twice with this Intelligence in the &s;hort Space of Time the A&s;&s;ault was carrying on in the Man+ner he had related; &s;o that, if he had invented the whole Story, he would have a&s;&s;igned &s;ome nearer Spot of Ground for the Place <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> which Captain <HI>Payne</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> waited to &s;uperintend and cover the A&s;&s;ault, and to receive the Intelligence he carried the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> concerning its Progre&s;s. In Truth that Part of Mr. <HI>Waelker</HI>'s Street which was near Mr. <HI>Bellair</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and, within a Dozen Yards of Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s, was the Spot he all along mentioned as the Place <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> which he delivered his Intelligence to Captain <HI>Payne</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham,</HI> both in his An&s;wers to the Que&s;tions put to him by the Court and in his Cro&s;s-Examination by the Pri&s;oner's Coun&s;el.</P>
<P>'The next Contradiction imputed to him is, a Mi&s;take in Point of Time. He &s;aid it was about eight o'Clock, or a little before&punc; when the Ruffians left Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s Hou&s;e to go to Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s to make the A&s;&s;ault, and that it was near nine o'Clock, but not quite nine when the whole Affair was over: And yet he &s;ays in another Part of his Evidence that he believes the A&s;&s;ault did not take up above a Quar+ter of an Hour. Gentlemen, I confe&s;s there is this Inaccuracy in the Witne&s;s's Evidence, and am de&s;irous that it &s;hould have its due Weight with you in the Pri&s;oner's Favour. But can this much avail him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &mdash;Can the Mi&s;take of a poor common Soldier concerning the pre|ci&s;e Time of a Tran&s;action he relates, when he judged of it only by gue&s;s and without either Watch or Clock, impeach the Credibility of his Te&s;timony concerning the Tran&s;action it&s;elf, when that Te&s;timony is rational and con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf in every other Particular? Certain|ly Gentlemen, it cannot. Mi&s;takes of half an Hour, or even a whole Hour, are frequently made by Men who ob&s;erve Time much more carefully than &s;uch Per&s;ons as the Witne&s;s can be &s;uppo&s;ed to do; and indeed they hardly de&s;erve to be called Mi&s;takes, becau&s;e the Differ|ence of Clocks is &s;ufficient to account for them. This &s;eems to me to &s;o u&s;ual and natural, that, in my Apprehen&s;ion, no Evidence what&s;o|ever concerning the preci&s;e Time of any Action de&s;erves to be much regarded, though delivered by the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Witne&s;s, unle&s;s the Per&s;on who delivers it declares at the &s;ame Time that he looked at a Clock or a Watch at the Time the Action happened, or immediately before or after, or el&s;e took particular Notice that it happened at the Time with &s;ome other regular Tran&s;action that is always carried on at a fixt Hour, &s;uch as the ringing of the Bell of a Church or Convent for Morning or Evening Prayers, or &s;ome other &s;uch remarkable Cir|cum&s;tance. Without &s;ome &s;uch Circum&s;tance I can ea&s;ily imagine that the mo&s;t hone&s;t and judicious Per&s;on in the World may mi&s;take
<PB N="65" REF="010958_0033_0F852F4F98983420">
a full Hour in the Time of any Tran&s;action he was pre&s;ent at, and &s;hould think it a mere chance if he was exact. In the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e the Witne&s;s &s;aid he believed it was a little before eight when they &s;et out from Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s Hou&s;e to commit the A&s;&s;ault: in which, I am per&s;uaded he mi&s;took the Time by more than half an Hour, for that it mu&s;t really have been more than half an Hour after eight; at lea&s;t by Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Clock; becau&s;e Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker,</HI> and the Clerk and Servant, who have been examined in &s;upport of the Pro&s;ecution, fix the Time of the A&s;&s;ault pretty exactly. And where now is the great Wonder that a common Soldier, who had no Watch, and who&s;e Mind was flurried with the thoughts of a dangerous Expedition he was going to be concerned in, and with &s;ome &s;trong Liquor he had taken to prepare him&s;elf for it &s;hould think it was only eight o'Clock when in Truth it was half an Hour or forty Minutes after?&mdash;I &s;ay, what is there to be &s;ur|pri&s;ed at in &s;uch a Mi&s;take? More e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that po&s;&s;ibly the Clock at Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s Hou&s;e, if there was one there, or, if there was not, the Clocks in his Neighbourhood, by which he and his Family had judged of the Cour&s;e of Time during that Day, might very well be forty Minutes flower than Mr. <HI>Walkers</HI>'s. Surely it de&s;erves very little Con&s;ideration. Tho&s;e triffling Inaccuracies, which may be &s;o ea&s;ily accounted for, &s;eem to me on the Contrary to add Strength to the Evidence of a Witne&s;s rather than to render it le&s;s cre|dible, &s;ince they &s;hew that the Witne&s;s an&s;wers fairly and hone&s;tly what his Memory &s;ugge&s;ts to him, without having artfully framed a regular Story with every Circum&s;tance in exact and perfect Order, that he might guard again&s;t the Po&s;&s;ibility of a Surpri&s;e.</P>
<P>'The next Contradiction in&s;i&s;ted on by the Coun&s;el for the Pri&s;oner is that concerning the Pri&s;oner's Dre&s;s. Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> has &s;aid that he was dre&s;&s;ed in a <HI>Canadian</HI> Gown, and the Witne&s;s <HI>Magovock</HI> has &s;aid that he was dre&s;&s;ed in a Blanket Coat. Gentlemen, there is a real in|con&s;i&s;tency between the&s;e Te&s;timonies. But, I believe, you will hardly think it of much Importance. It is ea&s;y for <HI>Magovock</HI> to have mi&s;taken the Dre&s;s of Major <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> among&s;t the Number of Per&s;ons he &s;aw on that Occa&s;ion, and yet to be very certain of his Per&s;on; as the Per&s;on of a Man makes a much &s;tronger Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Mind and Memo|ry of a Spectator than his Dre&s;s. And it mu&s;t be remembered that <HI>Macgovoek</HI> has told you that Major <HI>Di&s;ney</HI> was not one of the Party that dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves at Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and &s;et out from thence to go to Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s (in which Ca&s;e it might perhaps be expect|ed that <HI>Macgovock</HI> &s;hould remember his Dre&s;s exactly) but was one of the additional Party that came in to a&s;&s;i&s;t and protect the former, who&s;e &s;everal Dre&s;&s;es it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed that he can recollect with perfect Exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>'But, Gentlemen, the main Foundation of this Objection to <HI>Mac|govock</HI>'s Te&s;timony is by no Means favourable to the Pri&s;oner, as will appear if we con&s;ider it a little further. The Objection I take to be as follows: Macgovock's <HI>Evidence concerning Major</HI> Di&s;ney<HI>'s Dre&s;s is
<PB N="66" REF="010958_0034_0F852F504C238370">
cntrary to Mrs.</HI> Walker<HI>'s, and therefore fal&s;e; and con&s;equently the re&s;t of his Evidence is likewi&s;e either fal&s;e or doubtful.</HI> What then, is it admitted that Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Evidence concerning the Pri&s;oner's Dre&s;s on that Occa&s;ion is true? Nothing More is wanted on the Part of the Pro&s;e|cution. The Pri&s;oner was pre&s;ent at the A&s;&s;ault in a <HI>Canadian</HI> Gown according to Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Evidence; and <HI>Macgovock</HI> has been Mi&s;|taken in his Dre&s;s, and de&s;erves therefore no Credit in any other Part of his Te&s;timony. Let then his whole Evidence be &s;et a&s;ide as doubt|ful and good for nothing, &s;ince Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Evidence is thus admit|ted to be true.&mdash;But if Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Evidence is not allowed to be true&mdash;if the Per&s;on &s;he &s;aw there in a <HI>Canadian</HI> Gown was not Major <HI>Di&s;ney,</HI> but &s;ome other Per&s;on&mdash;then where is the In|con&s;i&s;tency of her Te&s;timony with that of <HI>Magovock</HI>'s? She may have been mi&s;taken in the Per&s;on &s;he took for the Major, and yet the Major may have been there in a different Dre&s;s, that is, in a Blanket-Coat, ac|cord to <HI>Macgovock</HI>'s Evidence. The mo&s;t that can be made of this Ob|jection, if a mi&s;take about the Pri&s;oner's Dre&s;s can be thought to be of &s;uch high Importance, is to get rid of the Evidence of one of the&s;e two Witne&s;&s;es; in which Ca&s;e the Pro&s;ecution will re&s;t upon the Evidence of the other of them, and of Mr. <HI>Walker.</HI></P>
<P>'The&s;e are, far as I can recollect, the principal Contradictions in the Witne&s;s <HI>Magovock</HI>'s Evidence on which the Gentlemen of Coun&s;el with the Pri&s;oner have in&s;i&s;ted: And, I pre&s;ume, Gentlemen, after what has been offered to your Con&s;ideration by way of Reply to the Con&s;e|quences that have been attempted to be drawn from them, that you will be clearly of Opinion that they do not materially affect the Credit of the other Parts of this Witne&s;s's Te&s;timony. But, as has been be|fore ob&s;erved, the whole Evidence of this Witne&s;s might very well be &s;et a&s;ide, if there was Rea&s;on for it, and yet the remaining Proof in &s;upport of the Pro&s;ecution would be more than &s;ufficient to be the Ground of a Conviction, being the po&s;itive Te&s;timony of two Witne&s;&s;es of indi&s;putable Credit. Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker,</HI> who have &s;worn that they &s;aw the Pri&s;oner in Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Hou&s;e at the Time of the A&s;&s;ault. This is a &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial Proof in &s;upport of the Pro&s;ecution, which neither the imperfect pre&s;umptive Evidence of the Pri&s;oner's Alibi, given by Witne&s;&s;es &s;trongly by&s;&s;ed in his Favour, and by the Wives and Daughters of Fellow-Pri&s;oners, nor the Mi&s;takes of a third Witne&s;s (though they had been as important as they have been &s;hewn to be in|con&s;iderable) can impeach. One Thing only can be alledged to di|mini&s;h the Weight of it and plead &s;omewhat in the Pri&s;oner's Favour, which I doubt not, Gentlemen, has already occured to you: I mean the Circum&s;tance of the Pri&s;oner's being &s;aid to have been di&s;gui&s;ed by a Crape that covered his Face. This, it might be thought, mu&s;t have made it difficult for Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> to de&s;cern the Features of his Face; without which it is po&s;&s;ible, and, in Favour of Innocence, might per|haps be pre&s;umed, that they had mi&s;taken &s;ome other Man that re&s;em|bled
<PB N="67" REF="010958_0035_0F852F526DAEB7A8">
the Pri&s;oner in Size and Shape to be the Pri&s;oner him&s;elf; and that the Hurry of their Spirits on &s;uch an alarming Occa&s;ion had &s;trengthed the Impre&s;&s;ion made by &s;uch a Re&s;emblance and contributed to confirm them in this Mi&s;take. This is, in my Opinion, the mo&s;t important Con&s;ideration that can be offered in the Pri&s;oner's Favour&punc; But, Gentlemen, in an&s;wer to it I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that both Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> have &s;worn that they di&s;tingui&s;hed the Features of his Face which takes away all Room for &s;uch a Mi&s;take. And that it is by no Means difficult to di&s;cern a Man's Features through a Crape you will ea&s;ily be convinced upon trial. Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> has brought here into Court a Peice of Crape of the &s;ame Kind with that which was drawn over the Face of the Man &s;he took to be the Pri&s;oner (and which is of the &s;ame Kind that Officers wear upon their Arms for mourning in Order to enable you to make this nece&s;&s;ary Trial. Take this with you, Gentlemen, when you withdraw to con&s;ider of your Verdict of this important Occa&s;ion, and try your&s;elves how far it is capable of concealing a Per&s;on's Features. I believe you will find it to be but a poor Di&s;gui&s;e, and will &s;oon be of Opinion that Mrs. <HI>Walker,</HI> at the Di&s;tance of about ten Feet, and Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> at that of only four Feet might very well have been able to di&s;cern the Features of the Per&s;on upon whom they fixed their Eyes to have been tho&s;e of the Pri&s;oner at the Bar.'</P>
<P>The Attorney-General having ended his Reply, the Chief-Ju&s;tice &s;ummed up the Evidence to the Jury, who, after withdrawing for about half an Hour, brought in their Verdict that the Pri&s;oner was Not Guilty: And the Pri&s;oner was thereupon di&s;charged.</P>
