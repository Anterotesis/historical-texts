<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHen fir&s;t I began the following Lines, I was &s;o far from the Le&s;ign of publi&s;hing them, that I only intended them as a private Let|ter to my Friend J. C. containing my Sentiments relating to the SOCIETY, from an Apprehen&s;ion of the Want of &s;uch Examples and Precepts in the Parents and Elders, as ri&s;e from the Experience of the Work of Regeneration, and the total &s;ubduing the natural Will of Man, and its being brought into compleat Subjection to the Will of God; by which, the De&s;ire and Inclination being changed, and they created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works might glorify God, in living new Lives; Lives of Holine&s;s and Purity; and &s;o might truly exhort the ri&s;ing Generation, to be "Followers of them, as they follow Chri&s;t;" and, from &s;uch a Conduct in the World, as proceeds from thence, might "a|dorn the Doctrine of God, our Saviour, in all Things;" and be as "Lights in the World," and an Honour to the high Profe&s;&s;ion we make among Men; without which Experience, Endeavours, in Education, are render'd &s;aint, and very much un|profitable.</P>
<P>But when I con&s;ider'd that the Publi&s;hing the en|&s;uing Lines, could not be injurious to any; but might be of &s;ome Advantage to the Religious and
<PB N="iv" REF="006846_0003_102A7D6E1E8B2338">Well-inclined (whether old or young) or at lea&s;t afford them an innocent, if not commendable, A|mu&s;ement, I was induced to publi&s;h them, that, as my Friend J. C. has &s;ea&s;onably called, more e&s;pe|cially to the Youth, I might likewi&s;e remind the El|ders of their Duty al&s;o; that all might an&s;wer their Calling, which is to Holine&s;s, and the End thereof, Eternal Life.</P>
<P>Innumerable are the Advantages enjoy'd, even in this Life, by &s;uch as take the Advice of our Sa|viour, viz. "Seek ye fir&s;t the Kingdom of God, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all the&s;e Things &s;hall be added unto you;" and if Mankind were &s;o happy, as "to remember their Creator in the Days of their Youth, while the evil Days come not," and knew their Affections limitted, and brought under proper Re&s;trictions, by the Operation of the Spirit of God, in their own Hearts, they would, thereby, be ful|ly furni&s;hed, unto every good Word and Work. This would likewi&s;e pre&s;erve the Youth in an in|nocent Conver&s;ation, and direct them, even in the Management of the Affairs of this Life, in their fir&s;t &s;etting out in the World, particularly in that important Affair of Marriage; and, afterwards, in the Chri&s;tian and prudent Education of their Chil|dren, &amp;c. the want of which, is the Cau&s;e of many Evils and Di&s;advantages, under which Mankind la|bour; that this may be as much as po&s;&s;ible avoided, and that Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s may be propa|gated, and continued, from one Generation to a|nother, is the De&s;ire of a Well-wi&s;her to all Man|kind, but, more e&s;pecially, to the Hou&s;hold of Faith.</P>

<L>WHoe're attempts Mens Morals to reclaim,</L>
<L>Or &s;hew wherein their Conduct is to blame;</L>
<L>Or dare remind Profe&s;&s;ors, more or le&s;s,</L>
<L>Wherein they err from what they do profe&s;s;</L>
<L>Mu&s;t, previous to this kind Attempt, expect</L>
<L>It will not always have its wi&s;h'd Effect:</L>
<L>The be&s;t Advice is often mo&s;t de&s;pis'd</L>
<L>By tho&s;e who want the mo&s;t to be advis'd;</L>
<L>The Whole, who think they no Phy&s;ician need,</L>
<L>Will no Advice receive, nor Caution heed;</L>
<L>The harden'd Sinner, being &s;tupid grown,</L>
<L>Will hate Reproof, and no Mi&s;conduct own,</L>
<L>And they, who after fading Plea&s;ure run,</L>
<L>And blindly them pur&s;ue, will Coun&s;el &s;hun;</L>
<L>The Unbelieving will not always be</L>
<L>Prevail'd upon, their Unbelief to &s;ee;</L>
<L>Nor will be apt In&s;truction to receive,</L>
<L>To learn of That, in which they don't believe:</L>
<L>While the Upright, and tho&s;e who are &s;incere,</L>
<L>Their Words and Ways review with jealous Fear;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="006846_0005_102A7D736DEF52B8">
Who doubt their Ca&s;e, and fear it is not right,</L>
<L>And often bring their Deeds unto the Light;</L>
<L>Who&s;e &s;ole Dependance is upon the Lord,</L>
<L>And cry to Him, that He may Strength afford;</L>
<L>And may from Evil daily them pre&s;erve,</L>
<L>That, from his righteous Law, they may not &s;werve.</L>
<L>Yet for the Sake of tho&s;e who are but frail,</L>
<L>On whom Temptations ea&s;ily prevail;</L>
<L>Or being heedle&s;s, have no &s;olid Thought</L>
<L>To judge aright of Matters as they ought;</L>
<L>Or being vain, and full of empty Prate,</L>
<L>Have no ju&s;t Notions of a future State;</L>
<L>Or being young, not much deprav'd by Sin,</L>
<L>Yet not adhering to the Guide within;</L>
<L>Or being older, ju&s;t begin to choke</L>
<L>Its clo&s;e Reprovings, to avoid its Stroke;</L>
<L>Or being older &s;till, and more to blame,</L>
<L>Their Duties know, and yet neglect the &s;ame:</L>
<L>In Love, to &s;uch, I ventur'd to di&s;clo&s;e</L>
<L>My private Thoughts, and the&s;e my Lines expo&s;e:</L>
<L>But think it ju&s;t to let my Reader know,</L>
<L>To what I do this Publication owe:</L>
<L>My fir&s;t Inducement having only been</L>
<L>A &s;mall Performance, which I've lately &s;een,</L>
<L>Which, when I &s;aw, I read with &s;ome Delight,</L>
<L>To &s;ee the Author there the Youth invite</L>
<L>To learn of WISDOM, that they may be wi&s;e,</L>
<L>And her In&s;tructions always truly prize;</L>
<L>Who&s;e Ways are Plea&s;ure, and who&s;e Paths are Peace,</L>
<L>And all that walk therein will find Increa&s;e.</L>
<L>O may the Youth, of this, their Choice yet make,</L>
<L>May they, betimes, his friendly Coun&s;el take,</L>
<L>And what Advice he there does freely give,</L>
<L>I hope, in Love, they will of him receive;</L>
<L>Who having now him&s;elf to them di&s;charg'd,</L>
<L>I own, I've wi&s;h'd his Heart again enlarg'd</L>
<L>To publi&s;h more Advice, more Coun&s;el &s;hew,</L>
<L>And tell the Elders next what they &s;hould do;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="006846_0006_102A7D75E283A9B0">
The Parents, how them&s;elves they &s;hould behave</L>
<L>In Conver&s;ation, prudent, wi&s;e, and grave;</L>
<L>That they thereby may good Examples give,</L>
<L>And &s;hew their Children how they ought to live;</L>
<L>And, by their Care, in ev'ry Word and Way,</L>
<L>May good In&s;tructions to their Minds convey:</L>
<L>For Children, when but young, are quick of Sight</L>
<L>To &s;py their Parents wrong, or find them right;</L>
<L>And &s;oon ob&s;erve how well their Words agree,</L>
<L>With that Behaviour which they daily &s;ee.</L>
<L>Here then is Room the Parents to advi&s;e,</L>
<L>That they may learn of WISDOM to be wi&s;e;</L>
<L>And having learnt compleatly to deny</L>
<L>The Glory, Pomp, and &s;hort-liv'd Vanity</L>
<L>Of this low World, that lies in Wickedne&s;s,</L>
<L>May to their Off-&s;pring &s;hew the Happine&s;s</L>
<L>Of Self-denial, and the inward Peace,</L>
<L>Which, thro' Obedience, daily doth increa&s;e:</L>
<L>Le&s;t, when their childi&s;h Ways and Years decline,</L>
<L>With greater Follies their Affections join.</L>
<L>That, from Experience, Children may be taught</L>
<L>To &s;et &s;uch low, uncertain Things, at nought;</L>
<L>And in their Minds the Principle in&s;til</L>
<L>Of due Submi&s;&s;ion to the heav'nly Will;</L>
<L>And daily by Example clearly &s;hew</L>
<L>The various Duties which to Men are due.</L>
<L>The&s;e needful Precepts, frequently impre&s;t</L>
<L>With Warmth and Sweetne&s;s, very oft are ble&s;t</L>
<L>With good Succe&s;s, and may in them create</L>
<L>A Love to Truth, and teach 'em how to wait</L>
<L>To know that Pow'r that would their Minds redeem</L>
<L>From ev'ry Sin, and gain them good E&s;teem.</L>
<L>This, to the Youth, would great Advantage prove,</L>
<L>And in the Parents &s;hew the Strength of Love,</L>
<L>Which to their Children would more &s;weetly flow,</L>
<L>Than their endeavouring riches to be&s;tow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I thought, 'tis true, how much he might have &s;aid,</L>
<L>Had he but then a further Progre&s;s made;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="006846_0007_102A7D7773FAF9F0">
Had he review'd the Church's pre&s;ent State,</L>
<L>So zealous once, &s;o much deprav'd of late;</L>
<L>So much declined from that godly Fear,</L>
<L>Which in our early Worthies did appear:</L>
<L>Who were influenc'd by that ju&s;t Regard,</L>
<L>That rather acts from Duty, than Reward.</L>
<L>The&s;e u&s;eful Hints, I thought, might aptly</L>
<L>Well recommended to my Friend J&mdash;C&mdash;</L>
<L>But when I wrote what fir&s;t to me accurr'd,</L>
<L>(By Zeal and Love together jointly &s;purr'd)</L>
<L>The fruitful Subject much deceiv'd my Quill,</L>
<L>Which, more than Hints, did &s;undry Pages fill:</L>
<L>Exceeding thus the Bounds I fir&s;t intended,</L>
<L>I've done the Work I would have recommended;</L>
<L>That, as the Youth by him admoni&s;h'd were,</L>
<L>The Elders might as ju&s;tly have a Share</L>
<L>Not &s;olid Elders, grounded well in Truth,</L>
<L>But carele&s;s Ones, unmindful of the Youth;</L>
<L>Old in Profe&s;&s;ion, older yet in Years,</L>
<L>In whom, as yet, no ju&s;t Concern appears</L>
<L>For Zion's Welfare, or the Church's Good,</L>
<L>Though getting Wealth by them is under&s;tood,</L>
<L>Who&s;e earthly Minds, by earthly Tho'ts employ'd,</L>
<L>Think all is well, if Riches are enjoy'd.</L>
<L>In gra&s;ping after which, th' Apo&s;tle &s;aith</L>
<L>"Some (then Believers) erred from the Faith,</L>
<L>"And pierc'd them&s;elves by many Sorrows," which</L>
<L>Men fall into by ha&s;t'ning to be rich;</L>
<L>Who&s;e nat'ral Off-&s;pring, by Example &s;way'd,</L>
<L>Are by the plea&s;ing Baits too &s;oon betray'd;</L>
<L>Their Wealth they mix, their Heaps together lay,</L>
<L>The Parents thus their Children oft betray</L>
<L>To join in Marriage, not unto the Lord,</L>
<L>Who &s;undry Cau&s;es of Complaint afford:</L>
<L>Thus Parents they become, before they know</L>
<L>The Source from whence all &s;olid Comforts flow;</L>
<L>And, while they know it not, none can expect</L>
<L>They &s;hould their Children to the &s;ame direct.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="006846_0008_102A7D79AF0F6CA0">
Thus, Avarice and Negligence, we &s;ee,</L>
<L>Of la&s;ting Hurt, and Con&s;equence, may be.</L>
<L>Tho' good Advice, and Conduct too, may fail,</L>
<L>Yet, many Times, we &s;ee it does prevail:</L>
<L>But no Endeavours, can have no Succe&s;s;</L>
<L>Where Care is not, there's none for God to ble&s;s:</L>
<L>Thus, Want of Zeal and Care, too often brings</L>
<L>An Inlet, fir&s;t to &s;mall, then greater Things;</L>
<L>From &s;mall Beginnings great Events proceed,</L>
<L>And early Failings greater Evils breed:</L>
<L>Plainne&s;s, as Trifles, fir&s;t is laid a&s;ide,</L>
<L>In Speech, and Cloathing, and pur&s;uing Pride;</L>
<L>They next the Cu&s;toms of the World admire,</L>
<L>Behave like others, others Ways de&s;ire;</L>
<L>This leads to join in Company, and then</L>
<L>They love to act, and do, like other Men;</L>
<L>Affect to look like others, high and great,</L>
<L>And not behold the Snare, till 'tis too late;</L>
<L>Profu&s;ely live, with Tables richly &s;pread,</L>
<L>As free from humble Tho'ts, as full of Bread;</L>
<L>Grandly appear expecting to advance</L>
<L>Them&s;elves thereby; and Fortunes to enhance;</L>
<L>Bu&s;ine&s;s they love, and croud them&s;elves with Trade,</L>
<L>Their Re&s;t they break, and Peace of Mind invade;</L>
<L>No inward Check can &s;carce attend to hear,</L>
<L>Nor too its ju&s;t Reproof can lend an Ear;</L>
<L>Trade mu&s;t be minded, Bus'ne&s;s carried on,</L>
<L>And new contrived Schemes be thought upon:</L>
<L>The Mind, thus hurried, oft is &s;orely vex'd,</L>
<L>And the Affairs of Life too much perplex'd.</L>
<L>The Mind ambitious, cannot &s;toop to &s;ee</L>

<L>They trade, they &s;pend, and more they &s;pend than gain.</L>
<L>Till Streights attend, and &s;triving proves in vain;</L>
<L>Their Pride then falls, their Sub&s;tance being low,</L>
<L>They've not wherewith to pay tho&s;e Sums they owe;</L>

<L>And cau&s;e Reproach, and Scandal, to be thrown</L>
<L>Upon the People they pretend to own;</L>
<L>This evil Conduct plainly gives the Lie</L>
<L>To their Preten&s;ions, tho' exceeding high:</L>
<L>For who, that is not moral, can pretend</L>
<L>To own the Truth, and call him&s;elf a Friend?</L>
<L>Or &s;ay the Chri&s;tian Doctrine he believes,</L>
<L>Who thus, By Fraud, his Creditor deceives?</L>
<L>Our Actions always louder &s;peak than Words,</L>
<L>And of our Hearts the be&s;t Ide' affords:</L>
<L>True &s;aving Faith, by Works is rightly &s;hown;</L>
<L>As Trees, by Fruits, are only truly known.</L>

<L>As ISRAEL was commanded to behold</L>

<L>Who&s;e great Uprightne&s;s, and Integrity,</L>
<L>Was, doubtle&s;s, what the Lord would have them &s;ee;</L>

<L>Of our Fore-fathers, and from due In&s;pection</L>
<L>Of their good Works, may rai&s;e a ju&s;t Reflection;</L>
<L>And &s;ee, if we their Virtues do retain,</L>
<L>With whom the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion doth remain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Friends, at fir&s;t, no &s;uch Examples gave,</L>
<L>But with the utmo&s;t Caution did behave;</L>
<L>And being then with Godly Fear endu'd,</L>
<L>Such Cau&s;e of Scandal purpo&s;ely e&s;chew'd,</L>

<L>I hope 'twill be with very great Regret,</L>

<L>Shall we, or others, from the Truth decline,</L>
<L>Which, in its Lu&s;tre, made our Ancients &s;hine?</L>
<L>And &s;hall we not upon that Arm depend,</L>

<L>Shall Ea&s;e and Fullne&s;s lead our Minds a&s;tray</L>
<L>To take our Flight, as on the Sabbath Day?</L>
<L>And &s;hall we from that Principle depart,</L>
<L>Which only can inform the darke&s;t Heart;</L>
<L>Subdue our Wills, our Pa&s;&s;ions regulate,</L>

<HEAD>A POSTSCRIPT, TO People of all other PERSWASIONS.</HEAD>

<L>THus having, Reader, in this &s;hort E&s;&s;ay,</L>
<L>Endeavour'd here (tho' briefly) to di&s;play,</L>
<L>How far a certain Sect of Chri&s;tians are</L>
<L>Become too much unlike what fir&s;t they were</L>
<L>In Life, and Conduct, though rais'd up of late,</L>
<L>And their Beginning of no longer Date</L>
<L>Than yet &s;carce Ninety Years; if in that Space</L>
<L>Some have declin'd their Zeal and Love apace,</L>
<L>Yet, to be ju&s;t, I mu&s;t the Truth declare,</L>
<L>No other Sect may with them yet compare,</L>
<L>All Things con&s;ider'd, take them every Way;</L>
<L>Their Doctrine and OEconomy &s;urvey:</L>
<L>The prudent Care they generally ob&s;erve</L>
<L>O'er &s;uch as from their wonted Practice &s;werve:</L>
<L>The due Relief they yield unto the Poor:</L>
<L>And Way of Marri'ge, never us'd before,</L>
<L>Incapable of Stealth (were Men &s;o bent)</L>
<L>Nor to be done without compleat Con&s;ent:</L>
<L>The great Advances by their Teachers made</L>
<L>In true Religion, though employ'd in Trade;</L>
<L>Though not in Learning, nor in Science &s;kill'd,</L>
<L>Yet with the Knowledge of Salvation fill'd,</L>
<L>Untainted yet by Lucre; fill'd with Zeal,</L>
<L>The&s;e to the Con&s;ciences of Men appeal,</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="006846_0022_102A7D9E0D684040">
And boldly la&s;h the Vices of Mankind,</L>
<L>Not bound by Hire, from Wages unconfin'd;</L>
<L>So that from hence true Knowledge doth increa&s;e,</L>
<L>And oft produce the Fruits of Joy and Peace;</L>
<L>Whil'&s;t others love the World, and lo&s;e their Ground,</L>
<L>And in the Steps of Libertines are found:</L>
<L>If the&s;e de&s;erve &s;uch ju&s;t and equal <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</L>
<L>How much more they, from whom th'Example came;</L>
<L>Who having been Profe&s;&s;ors long before,</L>
<L>And long declining, are declined more:</L>
<L>Was I to &s;ay how far &s;uch deviate</L>
<L>And leave their pure, their once reformed State,</L>
<L>It would become too great a Work for me,</L>
<L>A Volume fill, which they'd not like to &s;ee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If I have &s;par'd not tho&s;e whom mo&s;t I love,</L>
<L>And cannot Things unju&s;t in them approve;</L>
<L>Nor like to &s;ee them vain, like other Men,</L>
<L>Without Rebuke or Caution from my Pen;</L>
<L>Let not the Carele&s;s loo&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors be</L>
<L>Puff'd vainly up, with the&s;e Reproofs from me</L>
<L>On our Profe&s;&s;ors, but let each Profe&s;&s;ion</L>
<L>See they be clear of every &s;uch Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion;</L>
<L>And that they al&s;o may, in Truth, po&s;&s;e&s;s</L>
<L>The Practice of tho&s;e Tenets they profe&s;s:</L>
<L>Pre&s;erve the Kernal al&s;o with the Shell,</L>
<L>And, in the Temple, at the Altar, dwell;</L>
<L>Not pleas'd with Forms, and &s;o in Forms re&s;ort</L>
<L>To wor&s;hip God, but in the outward Court,</L>
<L>Whil'&s;t they in all the Fopperies engage,</L>
<L>And hug the Vices of a &s;inful Age;</L>
<L>Le&s;t they be al&s;o weigh'd, and wanting found,</L>
<L>And greater Faults in them than us abound.</L>
