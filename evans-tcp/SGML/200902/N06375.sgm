For the la&s;t Man that you put to Death, here are Five come in his Room: And if you have Power to take my Life from me, God can rai&s;e up the &s;ame Principle of Life, in Ten of his Servants, and &s;end them among you, in my Room; that you may have Torment upon Torment, which is your Portion; for there is no Peace to the Wicked, &s;aith my God.</HI> Then the Governor &s;aid, <HI>take him away to Pri&s;on.</HI>&mdash;Where he re&s;ted in Peace, and quietne&s;s of Spirit.&mdash;But within a Week after, came a Mar&s;hal, and Con&s;table to him in the Pri&s;on, with an Order from the Court, for his, and other Friends enlargement; who &s;aid, <HI>they were ordered by the Court, to make them acquainted with their new Law.</HI>&mdash; Then <HI>Wenlock</HI> &s;aid, <HI>what means this? have you a new Law? Yes,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>then you have deceived mo&s;t People,</HI> &s;aid Wenlock; <HI>why &s;aid they? becau&s;e,</HI> &s;aid Wen|lock, <HI>they did think the Gallaws had been your la&s;t Weapon; have you got more yet? Yes</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>Read it,</HI> &s;aid he; which they did. Then &s;aid Wenlock, <HI>Your Magi&s;trates &s;aid, your Law was a good and whole|&s;ome Law made for the Peace and Safeguard of your Country: What, are your Hands now become Weak? the Power of God is over you all.</HI> Then the Pri&s;on Doors were &s;et open, and Twenty &s;even more be&s;ides <HI>Wenlock,</HI> were turned forth; whereof two were &s;tripped to the Wa&s;te, and made, fa&s;t to Carts-tails, and Whipped through the Town of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> with Twenty cruel Stripes, on their naked Backs and Shoulders; &s;o into the Wilderne&s;s they were driven, by Sword and Club men, out of that Juri&s;diction. <HI>Glory, Glory be given to the Lord, over all</HI> &s;aith my Soul, <HI>who never leaves nor for&s;akes the Righteous, but redeems his faithful Ones out of all their Trouble; Prai&s;e the Lord all his Saints who are upon the Rock of Ages; And the Gates of Hell cannot prevail again&s;t you,</HI> &s;aith Wenlock Chri&s;ti&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Edward Wharton&punc;</HI> who was often cruelly Whipped, and Per&s;ecuted other Ways, was al&s;o taken from his own Hou&s;e in <HI>Salem,</HI> and carried to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and after he had been kept clo&s;e Pri&s;oner almo&s;t a Year, was (the 11th of the 1&s;t Month, 1660.) Bani&s;hed on pain of Death, to depart the Juri&s;diction in Ten Days. He replied, <HI>Friends,

I have Dealings with &s;ome People, it were good for me to have Time to make clear with all; and then, if you have Power to Murder me you may.</HI> The Governor &s;aid, <HI>If we give him an Hundred Days it is all one. Edward</HI> replied, <HI>I &s;hall not go away; therefore be careful what you do.</HI>&mdash;And he afterwards wrote to them, &s;ignifying, where|as they had bani&s;hed him on Pain of Death, he was yet at home, at his Hou&s;e in <HI>Salem,</HI> and could not go away, and therefore inti|mated to them to take off their wicked Sentence, from him, that he might go about his Occa&s;ions out of their Juri&s;diction. <HI>John Cham|berlain</HI> and <HI>Robert Harper,</HI> and others, were al&s;o bani&s;hed on Pain of Death.</P>
<P>A Letter was &s;ent from the King to the Rulers of <HI>New-England,</HI> dated the 9th Day of <HI>September,</HI> 1661, by which they were inquired to put no more Quakers to Death. But <HI>George Bi&s;hop</HI> gives Account in his Book, that they were continually whipped, impri&s;oned, and their Goods &s;poiled, in a wonderful, barbarous, and cruel Manner, expo|&s;ed to much Cold and Hard&s;hip in their Per&s;ecutions, &s;ometimes their Food was kept from them in Pri&s;on, and none &s;uffered to come at them, and not &s;uffered to have Food for their Money, the Mini|&s;ters &s;tirring up the Authority to per&s;ecute and drive them away; &s;o that in about &s;even Years, they &s;uffered more than one Hundred and Sixty Whippings, mo&s;t of them very cruelly laid on; one of them, <HI>Anne Coleman,</HI> being whipt almo&s;t to Death. <HI>G. Bi&s;hop, pag,</HI> 430. &mdash;Of which I &s;hall relate one Pa&s;&s;age concerning <HI>Eli&s;abeth Hocton,</HI> an ancient Woman, who came from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>New-England,</HI> and went about vi&s;iting in a godly Manner, and was many Times whipped, and cruelly u&s;ed for her Pains.</P>
<P>She crying, <HI>Repentance,</HI> through Part of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> was by two Magi&s;trates committed, who&s;e Jailor thru&s;t her into a noi&s;ome, &s;tink|ing Dungeon, where there was nothing to lye on, or &s;it on, and kept her there two Days and two Nights, without helping her to Bread or Water; and becau&s;e <HI>Benanuel Bower,</HI> a tender hearted Friend, brought her a little Milk in this her great Di&s;tre&s;s, (wherein &s;he had like to have peri&s;hed) they ca&s;t him into Pri&s;on, for entertaining a Stranger, and fined him Five Pounds. After this cruel U&s;age, and her lying two Days and two Nights in this di&s;mal Cell, &s;he was had to Court, and ordered to be &s;ent out of their Coa&s;ts towards <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> and to be Whipped at three Towns, ten Stripes at each, by the Way: So, at <HI>Cambrdige</HI> &s;he was tied to the Whipping Po&s;t, and la&s;hed with ten cruel Stripes, with a three-&s;tringed Whip, with three

Knots at an End; and at <HI>Watertown</HI> &s;he was laid on with ten Stripes more, of Rods of Willows; and at <HI>Dedham,</HI> in a cold fro&s;ty Morn|ing they laid on her aged Limbs ten La&s;hes more, with exceeding Cru|elty, at a Cart's Tail.</P>
<P>Her Skin and Fle&s;h being thus torn and beaten with the afore|&s;aid Extremities, they put her on Hor&s;e back, and carried her a weary Journey many Miles into the Wilderne&s;s, and towards Night left her there, where many Wolves and Bears, and wild Bea&s;ts u&s;ed &s;ometimes to &s;et upon living Per&s;ons, and many deep Water's to pa&s;s through, and then, as them&s;elves &s;aid, they thought they &s;hould &s;ee her no more.</P>
<P>But the Lord &s;o pre&s;erved her through the Waters, many of which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through with the Peril of her Life, and all other the ex|treme Inconveniencies of that her Condition, led her through, and up held her weak, brui&s;ed Body, and brought her the next Morning to Town called <HI>Reboboth,</HI> being neither weary nor faint, and then to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> to Friends, where &s;he was refre&s;hed, and gave Glory to the Lord who had counted her worthy, and enabled her to &s;uffer for his Name, beyond what her Age and Sex could otherwi&s;e rea&s;onably have born.

<P>UPON a Lecture-day at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New England,</HI> I was much pre&s;&s;ed in Spirit to go into their Wor&s;hip-hou&s;e among them, where I &s;tood &s;ilent-until the Man had done Preaching, then my Mouth was opened to the People with a word of Exhortation, but through the violence of &s;ome of the People was haled to Pri&s;on, from whence, about three Hours after, they fetched me out to the Court, where I was examined, and &s;o returned to Pri&s;on again until the Morning: and into the Court I was brought again, where they had drawn up a Paper again&s;t me, as they thought, of what I had &s;aid the day before; and they &s;aid, <HI>Come, thou Vagabond, and hear this Paper read with two Wit|ne&s;&s;es, their Hands to it, for we will handle thee:</HI> And I &s;aid, <HI>Read on;</HI> Where I &s;tood until they had done.

<HEAD>Concerning the Difference between the former Quakers, that &s;uffered Per&s;ecu|tions, and the&s;e in this Day.</HEAD>
<P>IF we may know them by their Fruits, they were two Manner of People, the fir&s;t often going to Meeting Hou&s;es, and bearing a godly Te&s;timo|ny after the Speaker had done, al&s;o teaching and exhorting at other public Places, for which they &s;uffered much Per&s;ecution, which they took joyfully, being upheld by the Power of God. And the&s;e, only holding Meetings of their own in a formal way, as other Profe&s;&s;ors do, having a form of God|line&s;s and not the Power and Life thereof, as the &s;uffering Quakers had; minding earthly Things, being adulterated and living in the Friend&s;hip of the World, which is Enmity with God. <HI>Jam</HI> 4.4. So the&s;e not having the Spirit as the fir&s;t Quakers had, are no more to be compared with them, than a dead Tree may be compared to a living Tree.</P>
