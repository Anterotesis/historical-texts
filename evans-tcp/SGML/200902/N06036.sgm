<P>AN APPENDIX To the late TOTAL ECLIPSE of LIBERTY.</P>
<P>Being &s;ome Thoughts on the End and De&s;ign of Civil Government; al&s;o the inherent Power of the People a&s;&s;erted and maintained; that it is not given up to their Repre&s;entatives; this confirm'd and acknowledged by Kings or Emperors, and prov'd from Scripture and Rea&s;on.</P>
<Q>LIBERTY it &s;o precious in the Eye of the Law, it is of &s;o tender a Regard, that it has re&s;erv'd the whole Di&s;po&s;e thereof to its own immediate Direction, and left no Part of it to the Di&s;|cretion of the Judges, and what the Law will not &s;uffer to be done directly, it does forbid that it be done indirectly, or by a Side-Wind. <BIBL>Ca&s;e of <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<Q><HI>Dion</HI> &s;ays, That the People held the Helm of Government in their own Power. And another very good Authority &s;ays, That the <HI>Saxons</HI> were a free People, govern'd by Laws made by the People, and therefore call'd a free People, becau&s;e they are a Law to them&s;elves.</Q>
<Q>As great a Lawyer as Judge <HI>Hale</HI> was, he would never &s;uffer the Strictne&s;s of Law to prevail again&s;t Con&s;cience; as great a Chancellor as he was, he would make u&s;e of all the Niceties and Subtilties in Law when it tended to &s;upport Right and Equity.&mdash;He governed him&s;elf indeed by the Law of the Go&s;pel, of "doing to others what he would have others do to him."&mdash;<BIBL>See his LIFE.</BIBL></Q>

<HEAD>APPENDIX To the TOTAL ECLIPSE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS I promi&s;ed in my late Piece, entitled, <HI>A</HI> TOTAL ECLIPSE or LIBERTY, &amp;c. to give the Publick &s;ome Thoughts on the <HI>Original of Civil Government,</HI> The <HI>Rights of the People,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;hall now proceed ac|cording to my Engagement: although I am &s;en&s;ible there is a large Field opens, I mu&s;t be Very &s;hort upon each Particular, dive&s;ting my &s;elf of all Partia|lity as I go along, continually keeping in my Eye the&s;e Maxims&mdash;<HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> is ju&s;tly represented <HI>blind;</HI> becau&s;e &s;he &s;ees no Difference in the Parties concern|ed&mdash;She has but one Scale and Weight, for Rich and Poor, Great and Small&mdash;Her Sentence is not guided by the Per&s;on, but the Cau&s;e&mdash;Impartiality is the Life of Ju&s;tice, as that is of Government&mdash;But to proceed&mdash;</P>
<P>I will &s;uppo&s;e in the fir&s;t Place, That all Men are <HI>&s;o ju&s;t,</HI> that not any <HI>one individual</HI> would do any Thing he imagin'd <HI>injurious</HI> to his Neighbour, but that they were only liable to &s;ome Mi&s;takes about their own and others Rights, and that this would oc|ca&s;ion Di&s;putes among them.&mdash;And I will further &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e <HI>hone&s;t Men,</HI> are too &s;u&s;picious to leave their Di&s;putes to the Arbitration of others, each fearing the Intere&s;t his Adver&s;ary has with the Per&s;on they leave their Affairs to&mdash;Now it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary from the&s;e Con&s;iderations, that there &s;hould
<PB N="4" REF="007664_0004_102DBA5751C42C08">
be CIVIL GOVERNMENT, a State of civil Society, of Freemen united under Government for the com|mon Intere&s;t. If any &s;hould &s;ay, How mu&s;t this Government be formed, and by whom? I an&s;wer, certainly by the&s;e very Men who&s;e Intere&s;t and Liber|ty are to be pre&s;erved;&mdash;"As the common Intere&s;t of the whole Body is the End of all Civil Polity, is owned by all. This, all Subjects <HI>in&s;i&s;t upon,</HI> and all Governors <HI>glory in,</HI> as their Dignity, except &s;ome vain <HI>Mon&s;ters,</HI> who forgetting their mortal State, ar|rogate to them&s;elves the <HI>Rights</HI> of Almighty GOD."</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Internal Structure</HI> of States, and the &s;e|veral Parts of the <HI>&s;upreme Power,</HI> 'tis ob&s;erved, "No Governors are the natural Parents or Progenitors of their People,&mdash;Nor has GOD by any Revelation no|minated Magi&s;trates, &s;hewed the Nature, or Extent of their Power, or given a Plan of Civil Polity for Mankind."&mdash;'Tis al&s;o allow'd, "To con&s;titute a State or Civil Polity in a regular Manner, the&s;e three Deeds are nece&s;&s;ary: Fir&s;t, A <HI>Contract</HI> of each <HI>one</HI> for <HI>all,</HI> that they &s;hould unite into one Society to be govern'd by one Coun&s;el. And next a <HI>Decree</HI> or <HI>Ordinance</HI> of the People concerning the Plan of Go|vernment; and the Nomination of the Governors. And la&s;tly, another <HI>Covenant</HI> or <HI>Contract</HI> between the&s;e Governors and the People, binding the Rulers to a <HI>faithful Admini&s;tration</HI> of their Tru&s;t, and the People to <HI>Obedience."</HI></P>
<P>Some may talk of a peculiarly divine Right; which is only a meer Dream of Court Flatterers; 'Tis true, in a Sen&s;e every Right is divine; but then it cannot be meant in any other Sen&s;e than as it is con&s;tituted by the Law of GOD and Nature.&mdash;The
<PB N="5" REF="007664_0005_102DBA58E5038A48">
Rights of the People are <HI>certainly divine</HI> as well as the Rights of Magi&s;trates; and I hope no one will di&s;pute, but that the Rights of the People the <HI>more divine</HI> than the Rights of their Repre&s;entatives, as the latter has no more than a <HI>delegated</HI> Power from the <HI>Fountain,</HI> cho&s;e for the Defence and Protection of the People; and they receive and hold that Power <HI>only from</HI> them, and <HI>by</HI> them&mdash;So that it's natural, nay a Duty, when the common Rights of this Community is trampled upon, or only the Liberty of <HI>one</HI> is attempted again&s;t, and that made a <HI>Precedent</HI> of, then they are perfidious to their Tru&s;t, and that Moment forfeit all the Power committed to them; the <HI>Alarm</HI> then ought to be given, but with <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Moderation;</HI> for if but one Member &s;uffers un|ju&s;tly, the <HI>whole</HI> Community is wounded <HI>through his</HI> Sides, and the Body Politick really &s;uffers as much as the Body natural does by loo&s;ing a Limb.&mdash;</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved by an excellent and approved Wri|ter, "That in all Ages there has been too much Patience in the Body of the People, and too &s;tupid a Veneration for their Rulers, which has produced many mon&s;trous Herds of mi&s;erable abject Slaves or Bea&s;ts of Burden, rather than civil Polities of rational Creatures, under the mo&s;t inhuman and worthle&s;s Ma&s;ters, trampling upon all Things human and di|vine with the utmo&s;t Effrontery.&mdash;A People enjoy Liberty, when each one is allowed to act as he in|clines, within the Bounds of Civil Law, and not &s;ub|jected to the Caprice of any other."&mdash;The <HI>Romans,</HI> in &s;peaking of a <HI>free People,</HI> generally mean a De|mocratical State, a Form of Government, where the &s;upreme or legi&s;lative Power is lodged in the <HI>Common

People,</HI> and have their Turns of Commanding as well as Obeying&mdash;</P>
<P>And though I might &s;ay much upon the <HI>Downfall</HI> of <HI>Tyranny</HI> and &s;how wherein the <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> has been vindicated and acknowledged even by their <HI>chief Rulers;</HI> but as I am in Hopes it will never be &s;uffered to arrive at any great Heighth here, without a noble Stand and Check, &s;hall only bring a few In&s;tances to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> one that had the Empire of the World, would not &s;uffer the People to call him <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tiberius Cae&s;ar,</HI> who &s;ucceeded him in the Em|pire, in an Oration he made to his People, u&s;eth the&s;e Words, "I have often, and do &s;till affirm, that a good and virtuous Prince, whom you have intru&s;ted with &s;o great and large Authority, ought to &s;erve the Senate, and all the Citizens often, and many Times particular Per&s;ons, neither do I repent of what I have &s;aid; and I have acknowledged you for my very good and favourable Lords, and do &s;till acknowledge the &s;ame."&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Trajan</HI> the Emperor confe&s;s'd, that he was <HI>inferior</HI> to the People; for when the <HI>Praetor</HI> delivered him the Sword at his Inauguration, he returned it to him again with the&s;e Words, "Take this Sword, u&s;e it for me; and that &s;o much the more, becau&s;e it is the <HI>more wicked</HI> for one that rules over all, to <HI>tran&s;gre&s;s</HI> the Law him&s;elf."&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>The&s;eus,</HI> in like Manner, a mo&s;t wi&s;e and valiant King of the <HI>Albenians</HI> acknowledged the People's Power to be above his; and affirmed, yea, gloried in it, <HI>That in Albens the People Reigned."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007664_0007_102DBA5E36B8D1D0">
Thus the greate&s;t Emperors have taken Plea&s;ure, and no doubt thought it a great Honour, to acknow|ledge them&s;elves the People's Servants; and the People their Lords or Ma&s;ters; and in &s;hort, when they behave well, and act agreeable to the Laws, they are worthy of <HI>double Honour,</HI> and gain the Affections of the People, in whom lies their Safety, and enkin|dles in them Love and Unity, as much as a Clergy|man does, when he preaches up, and inculcates the Truths of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and &s;ets a bright Example of Virtue, and adorns his Profe&s;&s;ion with Humility, a meek and quiet Spirit: but whenever he <HI>leaves the Standard,</HI> and begins to <HI>Lord it over his People's Faith,</HI> and broach un&s;ound Doctrines, and endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h them as <HI>Precedents</HI> for Truth, the People to prevent his overthrowing the Chri&s;tian Con&s;titution, exert <HI>their</HI> Right, and take away <HI>his</HI> Power, not with&s;tanding his Preten&s;ions of being a <HI>Me&s;&s;enger of the Lord of Ho&s;ts:</HI>&mdash;So it is in a poli|tical Sen&s;e agre<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> to the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution for the People to act <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the be&s;t in the World to make them happy <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Prince great and ho|nourable, as it is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> more honourable to reign over a <HI>free</HI> People than over <HI>Slaves.</HI>&mdash;And thus, (be it &s;poken with the greate&s;t Reverence) the DIVINE BEING him&s;elf, when he &s;peaks of his Power, &s;ays, <HI>My People &s;hall be</HI> willing <HI>in the Day of my Power:</HI> Here is no Force, for by our Make and Con&s;titution we are free Agents; if we are mi&s;erable, it is our own Faults; <HI>Liberty,</HI> is as it were interwoven into our very Natures, and we can no more &s;hake it off, without doing Violence to our&s;elves, than we can e|ra&s;e out ot our Minds the <HI>Law of Self Pre&s;ervation;</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="007664_0008_102DBA605FA6E7C0">
neither does GOD, Nature, Law or Rea&s;on oblige us to it&mdash;And though he is Independant and Almigh|ty, and accountable to none, he ever acts agreable to the eternal Rea&s;on and Nature of Things, and even &s;ometimes, as it were di&s;robes him&s;elf of his Maje&s;ty, and appeals to his People to te&s;tify again&s;t him, whe|ther he has not done them Ju&s;tice: &s;o great is his Conde&s;cention to his rational Creatures; and then, after having &s;et <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> before them, advi&s;es them to chu&s;e <HI>Life,</HI> but leaves them to their own Choice&mdash;</P>
<P>And though I could produce many more In&s;tances and Te&s;timonies of this Nature, from Philo&s;ophers, Orators, and others, &s;ome may &s;ay the Judgment of Man is not &s;ufficient Proof, therefore I &s;hall mention a few from Scripture and Rea&s;on, to &s;how that the Power is <HI>not inherent,</HI> as &s;ome imagine, in the Officers cho&s;e, but <HI>remains in the People</HI>&mdash;In the Old Te&s;ta|ment indeed, we read, that GOD called <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to the Government, and gave him a Commi&s;&s;ion;<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> iii.</NOTE> GOD him&s;elf al&s;o by his own Voice, appointed <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> to his Office: tho&s;e immediate Calls were ea&s;ily known by &s;ome particular Signs or Tokens, whereby the Lord made known his Mind to his People&mdash;<HI>Gideon</HI> was called by an Angel &s;ent from Heaven, and per|haps many other Judges were called in the &s;ame Manner; but whoever had this Call, there always was &s;omething or other in the Manner of it, or the Excellency of the Spirit, which &s;ufficiently convinced the People, that they were appointed by GOD to govern them, and then they with Plea&s;ure hearken'd to, and obey'd them, provided they did what was ju&s;t.

GOD calls a Man to the Government, by and with the Con&s;ent of the People. But not to mention any Thing that might be tedious; how the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were called by the Con&s;ent of the People, and went to make <HI>Saul, David, Solomon</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> Kings, as it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that in former Times it appears the Right of making Kings was <HI>in the People.</HI>&mdash;Then it is Idle and Trifling for any to pretend that the Power is not <HI>inherent</HI> in the People, and that they are &s;uch Fools as to give it away when they chu&s;e Repre&s;entatives and other Officers to rule them; or to &s;peak more properly, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in maintaining their ju&s;t Rights and Privileges.</P>

<P>Inconveniencies of Government often lies in the Exce&s;s of the Magi&s;trates Power; but certainly they are not to have any Power which is for the <HI>People's Hurt,</HI> which would be contrary to the very End for which is was de&s;ign'd, <HI>The People's Good.</HI>&mdash;<NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> xiii. 4.</NOTE> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> bids us to &s;ubmit to every Ordi|nance
