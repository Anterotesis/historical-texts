<HEAD>A PREFACE To the Reader</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reader;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOU have here another Attempt to confute the great Errors of the Peo|ple called <HI>Quakers,</HI> wherein, I think, &s;ufficient is &s;aid to make it appear to any &s;erious and con&s;iderate Per&s;on, <HI>That that People are not led by the Spirit of Chri&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e they do &s;o plainly, and it mu&s;t be added &s;o prophanly deny the <HI>Com|mands</HI> and <HI>Ordinances</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="003489_0004_0FF84C420C68C5E8">I. They deny that <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> in the outward Elements of them, <HI>Water, Bread and Wine,</HI> are Chri&s;t's Com|mands: And yet it is here made plain and Evident from the expre&s;s Words of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P N="1">1. With Re&s;pect to Bapti&s;m, that Water and the Spirit are joyned together, and both made nece&s;&s;ary to our Regeneration: And what Chri&s;t has joyned together, <HI>Joh. iii 5.</HI> let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Man pre&s;ume to put a&s;&s;under.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the Apo&s;tles under&s;tood outward Water to be commanded, by their actu|al u&s;ing of it, as <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Phillip</HI> did, which the <HI>Quakers</HI> allow, and yet pretend it is not nece&s;&s;ary: Do they think, that the Apo&s;tles would have u&s;ed Water, if they had not thought it nece&s;&s;ary? Would they have pre|&s;umed to do it, if they had not been a&s;&s;ured it was the Mind and Will of their Ma&s;ter, that it &s;hould be done.</P>
<P>And as Chri&s;t joyned Water and the Spirit <HI>Joh. iii 5.</HI> to St. <HI>Paul</HI> joyns <HI>The Wa&s;hing of
<PB N="iii" REF="003489_0005_0FF84C44E1CA9AB0">Regeneration</HI> with <HI>The Renewing of the ho|ly Gho&s;t, Tit. iii 5.</HI> which mu&s;t mean Wa&s;h|ing with Water in Bapti&s;m, joyned with the Sanctificaticn of the Spirit; For to &s;ay that by <HI>Water</HI> and the <HI>Wa&s;hing of Regeneration</HI> is meant the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and the <HI>Renewing of the holy Gho&s;t,</HI> where the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>holy Gho&s;t</HI> are mentioned at the &s;ame Time, is to make Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles &s;peak Non&s;ence; for it makes them &s;ay, <HI>We mu&s;t be born of the Spirit, and of the Spirit: We mu&s;t be renewed by the Holy Gho&s;t, and by the holy Gho&s;t:</HI> Which is ridiculous. The Quakers therefore are very Prophane in making Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles &s;peak Non&s;ence, and in &s;eparating what they have joyned together, and in making that needle&s;s which Chri&s;t has made nece&s;&s;ary, who &s;o evidently required both <HI>Wa|ter</HI> and the <HI>Spirtt.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. With Re&s;pect to the Lord's Supper, no|thing can he plainer, than that we are requir|ed to <HI>Eat Bread</HI> and <HI>Drink Wine,</HI> in <HI>Re|membrance of Chri&s;t's Death, litereally</HI> as well as <HI>&s;piritually:</HI> For the Quakers them|&s;elves don't deny but that Chri&s;t admini&s;tred
<PB N="iv" REF="003489_0006_0FF84C4736441AE8">the outward Elements: And it is clear, that be commanded expre&s;sly &s;aying. <HI>Do this in Remembrance of me,</HI> Luk. xxii 19. Yet the Quakers reject this Command of Chri&s;t, and will not do it in Remembrance of him. They allow that St. <HI>Paul</HI> meant outward <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> whereby we are <HI>to &s;hew forth Chri&s;t's Death till he come,</HI> and then ridi|culou&s;ly pretend he was not yet come &s;piritual|ly, though he had long before &s;ent his holy Spi|rit to 'em: And on the other Hand they &s;ay, he is now long &s;ince come, though that Text evidently means his coming to <HI>Judgment,</HI> and can be meant of nothing el&s;e, &s;ince he was long before that come both per&s;onally and &s;piritually: Yet they, I doubt willfully, &s;hut their Eves and &s;ay they will not &s;hew forth the Lord's Death by that outward Ordinance.</P>
<P>Thus Water Bapti&s;m and the Supper of Bread and Wine are as plainly required as Words can make them; and I defy the <HI>Quakers</HI> to &s;hew in what Words, they could have been more plainly expre&s;&s;ed, if it had been Chri&s;t's De&s;ign to command them.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="003489_0007_0FF84C48CB833848">In &s;hort, I think it mu&s;t be very plain to any unprejudiced Per&s;on, that by the &s;ame Method of Interpreting Scripture as they u&s;e again&s;t Water Bapti&s;m, and Bread and Wine, they may Interpret away all the Doctrines of Chri&s;t, and even his own Humane Nature of Fle&s;h and Flood it &s;elf, and may &s;ay that it was all only &s;piritual, and there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne but a Chri&s;t with|in, and that be only <HI>died &s;piritually,</HI> as that Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper are only &s;piritu|al: and thus indeed <HI>George Fox,</HI> their origi|nal Teacher fir&s;t taught. And then where is Chri&s;tianity? It is all Delu&s;ion and nothing but parable and Allegory; but dreadfull delu&s;ions the&s;e are. Let therefore every &s;erious Per&s;on beware of the fatal Tendency of the&s;e Doctrines that deny the literal Meaning of the&s;e plain Commands of Chri&s;t, of Water Bapti&s;m and Bread and Wine. for,</P>
<P N="2">II. It is plain that &s;ince they deny the&s;e expre&s;s Commands of Chri&s;t, what ever they pretend they are not led by the Spirit of Chri&s;t;for his Spirit would teach them, that they are his Laws and that they mu&s;t be Obedient to them, if they would be &s;aved: In&s;tead of which they make a mere Mock of them.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="003489_0008_0FF84C4AF82BAF38">Let therefore the people of God diligently read what is here offered, and take care not to be deceived by the&s;e Seducers, who would tempt them to deny their Bapti&s;m, and con&s;equently to deny Chri&s;t by denying his &s;acred Laws and In&s;titutions.</P>
<P><HI>I conclude with the La&s;t Words of St.</HI> Paul <HI>in his &s;econd Epi&s;tle,</HI> Ye therefore Beloved, &s;eeing ye know the&s;e things, beware le&s;t ye al&s;o being led away with the Error of the Wicked fall from your own Stedfa&s;tne&s;s: But grow in Grace and in the Knowledge of our Lord and &s;aviour Je&s;us chri&s;t: to him be Glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> now and for ever, <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>

<P>_MY &s;olicitous Concern for the Honour of Chri&s;t's In&s;titution, and the Safety of tho&s;e Souls committed to my Charge, has indu|ced me to appear publickly, in Oppo&s;iti|on to the Attempts of tho&s;e wicked Sedu|cers that labour by all po&s;&s;ible Means to propagate their poi&s;onous Errors, and influence Men to neglect, de&s;pi&s;e and contemn tho&s;e &s;acred Rites of Reli|gion, that have always been treated with the greate&s;t Re|verence and Re&s;pect by the Church of Chri&s;t, yea, by all Chri&s;tians all the World over, and looked upon, not only as the Ordinances of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, but al&s;o as nece&s;&s;ary Means of our Salvation and Happine&s;s, and the proper In&s;truments of conveving to us the Grace and Comforts of God's holy Spirit; of which holy Ordinances the &s;acred Scriptures &s;peak with no le&s;s Honour and Reverence:</P>

<P>I HAVE taken no Notice of <HI>James Mott's</HI> Expo&s;iti|on of 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii 21. becau&s;e I &s;aw no Argument in it; but am &s;ince told, that Paragraph is reckoned by 'em the fine&s;t flower in his Book; and therefore I will offer a Word or two upon it in this Place. St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;ays, v. 20. &mdash; <HI>Fight Souls were &s;aved by Water. v.</HI> 21. <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ike Figure whereunto Bapti&s;m doth now &s;ave us. James Mott &s;ays, The Water of Noah's Flood was &s;ent to de&s;troy, and not to &s;ave. That it was the Ark that was &s;aving, and the Water de&s;troy|ing.</HI> I refer to his Book, without reciting the whole Pa&s;&s;age, p. 11, 12. From whence I conclude he would infer, that what <HI>Noah</HI> and his Family were &s;aved by, was no Type of Water Bapti&s;m, becau&s;e the Type was not <HI>Water,</HI> but <HI>the Ark.</HI></P>
<P>NOW if <HI>James</HI> had been a very little learned in the <HI>Greek,</HI> he might have found out that nothing in all that 15 <HI>vers</HI> could be pitched upon for the Type but the Wa|ter, of which Bapti&s;m is expre&s;sly called the Antitype, for in the Original it is <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Omega</NOTE> <HI>HO ANTELUPON BAP|TISMA</HI> rendered <HI>The like Figure whereunto Bapti&s;m, &amp;c. HO</HI> being a Relative of the Neuter, mu&s;t have an Ante|cedent of the &s;ame Gender in the preceeding Ver&s;e, which can't be the Ark, for that is Feminine, but the Water only, which is Neuter. So that St <HI>Peter</HI> certain|ly meant <HI>that Water</HI> as a Type of Bapti&s;m, and not the Ark: And if he did not &s;peak Sen&s;e, <HI>J. Mott</HI> mu&s;t di|&s;pute it with him.</P>
<P>BUT it is &s;ufficient for me to ob&s;erve, that the hard|er St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;trained him&s;elf for the Allu&s;ion, by &s;o much the Stronger is the Argument for Water Bapti&s;m,
<PB N="x" REF="003489_0012_0FF84C53B745A880">since Water is expre&s;sly mentioned as the Type, even at the Ri&s;que of his own Reputation, if the Quakers mu&s;t &s;tand Expo&s;itors.</P>
<P>AND when <HI>J. Mott</HI> in the &s;ame Paragraph expounds the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, to be a &s;piritual rai&s;ing up of Chri&s;t in the Soul: What &s;hall we think he de&s;igns to make of the mo&s;t demon&s;trative Prove of our Religion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> And he will do well to tell us. how he will allegoriz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the following Words. <HI>v.</HI> 22. <HI>Who is gone into Heaven, and is on the right Hand of God</HI> &amp;c. If the Re&s;urrection be &s;piritual and inward, the A&s;cen&s;ion mu&s;t be &s;o too. The Evidences of our Religion would &s;oon be demoli&s;hed, if they were left to the&s;e ignorant Allegorizers. But in|deed they have no Occa&s;ion for &s;uch Evidences; if it will &s;erve only to turn Men's Minds inward, to &s;uch Manife&s;tations as may be found there, without any Thing outward: For whatever they pretend of other Teach|ers, Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles did not preach &s;uch Doctrine, Chri&s;t referred Men to his Works, as the fulle&s;t Proofs of his Doctrine; and the Apo&s;tles preached the Re&s;ur|rection of Chri&s;t, that God rai&s;ed him up, not in their Hearts, but out of the Grave.</P>
<P>BUT I will now add no further upon this, but only ask <HI>J. Mott,</HI> what he imagines St. <HI>Peter</HI> would think if he was now upon Earth, to find his own plain ea&s;y Writ|ings thus wre&s;ted by the <HI>Unlearned and U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;table,</HI> as well as tho&s;e Writings his Brother Paul writ according to the Wi&s;dom given him (that is above others) being a very learned and polite Writer) in who&s;e Epi&s;tles St. <HI>Pet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> &s;ays, <HI>are &s;ome Things hard to be under&s;tood?</HI> His Schollar|&s;hip carried him &s;ometimes above vulgar Capacities, but little did the plain Fi&s;herman think, his Writings &s;hould meet with the &s;ame Fate, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii 16.</P>
<P>I SHOULD have added &s;ome things farther in the Dialogues, but found them &s;well to a Bulk fa&s;ter than
<PB N="xi" REF="003489_0013_0FF84C55DBAD6360">expected; perhaps I may find Occa&s;ion to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dd another Dialogue hereafter. My Aim is to di&s;cover Truth, and e&s;tabli&s;h my Flock in the Faith that was <HI>once delivered to the Saints,</HI> a nd pre&s;erve them from the wicked Attempts of &s;uch Deceivers, as under a Cloak of great Sobriety and Ab&s;tractedne&s;s from the World, would draw them in|to Divi&s;ions and Parties, and an utter Contempt of what is mo&s;t valuable in Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>LET me earne&s;tly de&s;ire your Prayers with mine, that the Great God of Heaven would &s;ucceed my Endeavours for this End, and effectually by his Grace pre&s;erve you from all Attempts of wicked Men to &s;educe you from the Simplicity of the Go&s;pel of JESUS CHRIST.</P>

<P>Thou need'&s;t not call Evidences, I per|ceive what thou intende&s;t, and I don't deny the Matter; many &s;erious good People are Converts from a State of Irreligion and Wickedne&s;s; and our Teachers often tell us their Experiences, how very wicked their Hearts and Lives were, before it plea&s;ed God to pour his Spirit mightily, upon them, which led them into the Way thou call'&s;t <HI>Quakeri&s;m.</HI></P>

<P>This is the very Thing I &s;aid, their Lives were before a Contradiction to their Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and they were a Scandal to the Religion they owned; <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> would have had more Credit, if they had profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves <HI>Mabome|tans.</HI> And when all Methods of Conviction and In&s;truction proved ineffectual to reclaim them, and bring them to a Temper and Spirit becom|ing Chri&s;tianity, God gave them up to a Spirit of Error and Infatuation, as a ju&s;t Judgment upon them, for refu&s;ing to be reformed by the powerful Methods of his Grace; as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of &s;ome, 2 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> ii 11. 12. <HI>For this Cau&s;e

For tho' &s;ome Sinners by the Grace of God become true Penitents, yet great Wickedne&s;s is &s;o far from recommending Men to God's &s;pecial Favour, that on the contrary, it gives Ground to expect his &s;evere Judgment, and Dereliction in Error, when Men per&s;i&s;t long in their Wickedne&s;s and Irreligion, after proper Means and Opportu|nities afforded them for their Conviction and Re|claiming.

<P>It was never the Work of God's Spirit, but the whims of Quakers Brains, to call any mere internal Action or Motion <HI>Chri&s;tian Bap|ti&s;m,</HI> or the Bapti&s;m that Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted in his Church: This is a device of their own. And tho&s;e very Motions and Impre&s;&s;ions which they feel in them&s;elves, and call <HI>Inward Bapti&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Spirit Bapti&s;m,</HI> you can never prove nor per&s;wade me they come from the Spirit of God: God's Spirit indeed dwells in his own faithful People, but not in the Wicked and Reprobate, and tho&s;e that are abandoned to Error and Delu&s;ion. Such Men may feel Motions and inward Impul&s;es, but they come rather from the Devil than from the Spirit of God.

<P><HI>He intends, that Convictions of Truth come only from God's Spirit in us, that all Men have a Mea&s;ure of this Sprit that will teach them all Things that concern their Salvation, if they will but attend to it; and that the People called Quakers, in&s;tead of per&s;wading Men to outward Performances and Ceremonies, only direct them to bearken to &s;uch Teaching as they will find in them|&s;elves without going to any Men to teach them; and that all Religion, Hope and Comfort con&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch inward Feelings and Motions as every

<P>Is it not Mens Duty then to hearken to this inward Spirit, and is it not nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould know this to be their Duty, and the only Way to be happy?</P>
</SP>

<P>Undoubtedly, and this is what our Teach|ers per&s;wade Men to, and to depend wholly upon Chri&s;t and his Spirit in their own Hearts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eu&s;eb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus while they are teaching outward|ly and pre&s;cribing Men's Duty in the mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary Part, they juggle them into a Belief, that they have no outward Teaching, but all is in ward and from Gods Spirit, and not from any Man; and certainly all the Labours of all your Teachers are wholy u&s;ele&s;s upon this Principle; but the Matters of Fact are fal&s;e, and you cannot but know them &s;o; they depend upon outward Teachings as much as others. In <HI>Sewal</HI>'s Hi&s;to|ry of the Quakers, there is a Letter of <HI>Samuel Cri&s;p,</HI> and another of <HI>Evan Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans,</HI> both giving an Account of their Conver&s;ion to Quakeri&s;m, and they a&s;cribe it to reading <HI>Barclay</HI>'s <HI>Apology</HI> fir&s;tly, and then compleated by others Books and Conver&s;ation, and one of them mentions a very hearty &s;haking of Hands among the Quakers. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xal gives an Account that <HI>George Fox</HI> per&s;wa|ded and convinced many, and it was by &s;peaking not much but powerfully. This is the &s;ame outward Way that all fal&s;e Teachers take, to per|&s;wade Men of what they would have them believe

and receive. If all Men have a Light or Spirit within them, teaching them all Things, why don't they leave them to that Teaching? or el&s;e why do they impo&s;e &s;uch Fal&s;hoods upon the World, that they depend upon an inward Spirit, and turn People to that, and not to outward Teach|ings of Men? Can any Body think, but that the Books that the Quakers have written and printed and di&s;per&s;ed, are de&s;igned to per&s;wade and turn People to be of their Religion. And though they per&s;wade them again&s;t &s;ome outward Performan|ces, that we believe and teach to be nece&s;&s;ary, yet they have outward Performances of their own in&s;tead of them; they pretend to pray as loud as other People, and hold forth their Principles and teaching with a Voice that may be heard with outward Ears, without being in 'em; they have Weekly Meetings, and Monthly and Yearly &amp; Quarterly, according as the Sun pa&s;&s;eth through the &s;everal Signs in the <HI>Zodiak:</HI> Thus they ob|&s;erve Times and Sea&s;ons, Days and Months and Quarters, according to their own wicked Inventi|ons, honouring their own Traditions above the ordinances of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>According to the literal Signification of the Word Baptize, it implies an outward applica|tion, which can't be under&s;tood of any Thing but Water, e&s;pecially con&s;idering Water was then made u&s;e of in Bapti&s;m. <HI>Baptizing</HI> &s;ignifies ei|ther <HI>Wa&s;hing</HI> or <HI>Immer&s;ion,</HI> thus our Savious &s;ays, the <HI>Jews</HI> held <HI>the Wa&s;hing of Cups and Platters, Mark.</HI> vii 4.

<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> bids the <HI>Corinthians</HI> &s;hew forth he Lord's Death till he come; I &s;u&s;pect the Qua|kers realty believe no coming of Chri&s;t but what 7. <HI>Mott</HI> calls in Spirit in them, nor no Re&s;urrec|tion of Chri&s;t but in their Souls. And if Chfi&s;t is not to come bodily and vi&s;ibly, then neither did he a&s;cend vi&s;ibly and bodily; and the Con&s;e|quence of making the&s;e Things merely &s;piritual and allegorical (if the Quakers do &s;o) is to de|&s;troy the Foundation of our Hope, and make the Apo&s;tles all Lyars, and the Faith of Chri&s;tians all vain. But let J. Mott for once be in the Right, if by Pa&s;&s;ovcr he means the Supper of the Lord, out Saviour celebrated it with his Di&s;ciples to &s;hew they &s;hould &s;eed upon his Body and Blood &s;piritually, when he &s;hould be &s;piritually in them. And certainly for a Ma&s;ter to do a Thing before the Eyes of his Servants, to &s;hew them hew to do it, is a very proper familar and ea&s;y Way of In&s;tructing, and thus indeed we believe our ble&s;ted Saviour taught his Di&s;ciples what he in tended they &s;houl]dl do in order to make a &s;hew or Memorial of his Death: But would not any Body think then. they ought to do as they were &s;hewd? Which was to perfrom an outward Ac|tion
<PB N="66" REF="003489_0079_0FF84CE707B60F60">
with a &s;piritual Signification. And without &s;uch outward Action, they never can do as they were &s;hewed. And it is very plain that the Apo|&s;tles, and the Church of Chri&s;t ever &s;ince, have ob&s;erved our Lord's Direction in this Point, (ex|cept &s;ome Popi&s;h Corruptions which our Church hath reformed according to the primitive Model) and e&s;pecially may we find plain In&s;truction in this Mater from St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Directions to the <HI>Co|rinthians,</HI> whom he commends for ob&s;erving the Ordinances as he had delivered 'em to them, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi 2.

<P>The Epi&s;tles to the &s;everal Churches were adapted to &s;ome particuler Emergencies, and we are not to imagin, they contain all In&s;tructions the Apo&s;tles gave to the&s;e Churches; but as they preached one Religion every where, we may con|clude, that whatever is delivered as Chri&s;tian Doctrine or In&s;titution to one Church, the &s;ame was taught in all the re&s;t, and particular as to this Epi&s;tle, we find that all Chri&s;tians in every Place are concerned in the Contents of it, it is a Catho|lick Epi&s;tle, directed to the <HI>Corinthians, with all that in every Place call on the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> i 2. And the Benefits of this In&s;titution here mentioned are &s;uch as are ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for all Chri&s;tians, and therefore the Celebration a Duty for all; and accordingly we read that the fir&s;t Converts to Chri&s;tianity con|tinued &s;tedfa&s;tly in the Apo&s;tles Doctrine and Fellow&s;hip, and in Breaking of Bread, and in Prayer, <HI>Act.</HI> ii 24.

<P>J. Mott tells a particular Rea&s;on for Paul's ob&s;erving this Supper among the Corinthians, becau&s;e they were carnal and weak Believers, and to &s;hew that Chri&s;t was not come &s;piritually in them.</P>

<P>I am weary of hearing his Non&s;en&s;e and Ab&s;urdities; how could they have Communion to the Body and Blood of Chri&s;t, which is cer|tainly a &s;piritual Priviledge, if Chri&s;t was not in them by his Spirit? How could St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ay to tho&s;e very <HI>Corinthians,</HI> Chap. xii v. 13. <HI>We are all by one Spirit baptized into one Body,</HI> if the Spirit of Chri&s;t was not in them? Does <HI>J. Mott</HI> think Men may be baptized with the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and yet Chri&s;t not be in them &s;piritually? Thus you &s;ee the &s;illy ignorant Creature oppo&s;ite to him&s;elf as well as to all Truth and Rea&s;on If <HI>J. Mott</HI> had taken notice of what St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays to the&s;e <HI>Corinthians,</HI> Chap. i v. 4, 5, 6, 7. he would not have pronounced them thus de&s;titute of Chri&s;t's Spirit; St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays they were <HI>emiched in every thing by him in all Utterance and Know|ledge,</HI> &s;o that they <HI>came behind in no Gift.</HI> And Chap. vi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 5. he &s;ays, <HI>And &s;uch were &s;ome of you; but ye are wa&s;hed, but ye are &s;anctified, but ye are ju&s;tified in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us and by the Spirit of our God:</HI> What think you now of tho&s;e carnal Believers without the Spirit of Chri&s;t.</P>
