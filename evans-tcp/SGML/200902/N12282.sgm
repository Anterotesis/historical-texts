<P>HAVING in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent week, laid before the Public, &s;ome Remon&s;tran|ces, which our pre&s;ent &s;ituation called on us to make to the Pre&s;ident and Council, and in which we conceived you were equally (tho' not &s;o immediately) concerned with our&s;elves, and perceiving that advantage is taken of our &s;itua|tion, to repre&s;ent us to you, as men dangerous to the community: We think our&s;elves bound, by the duty we owe to our country, to our families, to tho&s;e who have heretofore held us in e&s;teem, and to the general welfare of &s;ociety, to addre&s;s you, and lay before you, a particular &s;tate of a mo&s;t dangerous attack, which has been made upon the cau&s;e of civil and religious freedom, by confining, and attempting to ba|ni&s;h, from their tendere&s;t connections, a number

of men, who can, without boa&s;ting, claim to them&s;elves, the characters of upright and good citizens.</P>
<P>FOR &s;ome time pa&s;t, it has been a &s;ubject of public conver&s;ation, that li&s;ts were made out of great numbers of the citizens of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> who were to be confined for offences, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been committed again&s;t the intere&s;ts of <HI>America</HI>&mdash;The&s;e reports were generally pre&s;um|ed to ari&s;e from intemperate zeal, and per&s;onal animo&s;ities; and, until the attempt, which creates the nece&s;&s;ity of calling your attention to us, little regard &s;eem'd to be paid to them.</P>
<P>BUT a few days &s;ince the &s;cene opened, and we, the &s;ub&s;cribers, were called upon, by per&s;ons, not known as public officers of ju&s;tice, to put our names to a paper,
<Q>promi&s;ing not to depart from our dwelling-hou&s;es, and to be ready to appear, on the demand of the Pre|&s;ident and Council of the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania,</HI> and to engage to refrain from doing any thing injurious to the United Free States of <HI>North America,</HI> by &s;peaking, writing, or otherwi&s;e, and from giving intelligence to the Commander of the Briti&s;h forces, or any
<PB N="3" REF="015496_0005_0F9985D0BB48CDB8">
other per&s;on whatever, concerning public affairs.</Q></P>
<P>CONSCIOUS of our innocence, in re&s;pect to the charges in&s;inuated in this paper again&s;t us, and unwilling to part with the liberty of breath|ing the free air, and following our lawful bu&s;i|ne&s;s beyond the narrow limits of our hou&s;es, di&s;daining to be con&s;idered in &s;o odious a light, as men who by crimes had forfeited our com|mon and inherent rights, we refu&s;ed to become voluntary pri&s;oners, and rejected the propo&s;al. We demanded with that boldne&s;s, which is in&s;eparable from innocence, to know by what authority they acted, of what crimes we were accu&s;ed meriting &s;uch treatment; and tho' to &s;ome of us the &s;mall &s;atisfaction was given, of acquainting us, they acted in pur&s;uance of a recommendation of Congre&s;s; and to others was read, part of a warrant, from the Pre&s;ident and Council; yet, not one of us, was allowed the indi&s;putable right, of either reading or copy|ing it. Altho' the great number of me&s;&s;engers, employed in the execution of this warrant, and of the per&s;ons who were the objects of it, varied &s;ome of the circum&s;tances attending it, yet the general tenor of their conduct was uniform,

and marks the &s;pirit which actuated them. We were all upon our refu&s;al to &s;ub&s;cribe, either immediately, or in &s;ome &s;hort time conducted to this place, where we remained in clo&s;e con|finement, under a military guard, for twenty-four hours, expecting to be inform'd of the cau&s;e of our being taken, and to have an opportunity of defending our&s;elves; but finding no notice taken of us by our per&s;ecutors, we at length, unitedly demanded of one of the principal me&s;&s;engers, a copy of the warrant, by virtue of which we were &s;eized, in order that we might know from thence, what heinous crimes were charged on us, to ju&s;tify &s;uch rigorous treat|ment. After con&s;ulting his employers, and cau&s;ing &s;ome delay, he thought proper to grant our demand&mdash;But how were we a&s;toni&s;hed to find a General Warrant, &s;pecifying no manner of offence again&s;t us, appointing no authority to hear and judge, whether we were guilty or innocent, nor limiting any duration to our con|finement!&mdash;Nor was this extraordinary Warrant more exceptionable in the&s;e re&s;pects, than in the powers given to the me&s;&s;engers to break, and &s;earch not only our own, but all the hou&s;es their heated imaginations might lead them to &s;u&s;pect. It would be tedious to remark all

<P>BEFORE the receipt of that letter, we had prepared and &s;ent the following Remon&s;trance:

<HEAD>To the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> and <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> The <HI>Remon&s;trance</HI> of the &s;ub&s;cribers, Freemen, and Inhabitants of the City of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> now confined in the Ma&s;on's Lodge.</HEAD>
<OPENER>SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>THAT the &s;ub&s;cribers have been by virtue of a warrant &s;igned in Council by George Bryan, Vice-Pre&s;ident, arre&s;ted in our hou&s;es,
<PB N="18" REF="015496_0020_0F9985DE03CB9690">
and on our lawful occa&s;ions, and conducted to this place, where we have been kept in clo&s;e confinement, under a &s;trong military guard, two or more days&mdash;that altho' divers of us de|manded of the me&s;&s;engers who arre&s;ted us, and in&s;i&s;ted on having copies of the &s;aid warrant, yet we were not able to procure the &s;ame, till this pre&s;ent time, but have remained here un|accu&s;ed and unheard. We now take the earlie&s;t opportunity of laying our grievances before your body, from whom we apprehend they pro|ceed, and of claiming to our&s;elves the Liberties and Privileges to which we are entitled by the fundamental rules of ju&s;tice, by our birthright and inheritance, the laws of the land; and by the expre&s;s provi&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Con&s;ti|tution, under which your board derive their power.</P>
<P>WE apprehend, that no man can lawfully be deprived of his Liberty, without a warrant from &s;ome per&s;ons having competent authority, &s;pecifying in offence again&s;t the laws of the land, &s;upported by oath or affirmation of the accu&s;er, and limiting the time of his impri&s;on|ment until he is heard, or legally di&s;charged,
<PB N="19" REF="015496_0021_0F9985DE50396D58">
unle&s;s the party be found in the actual perpe|tration of a crime. Natural ju&s;tice, equally with law, declares that the party accu&s;ed &s;hould know what he is to an&s;wer to, and have an opportunity of &s;hewing his innocence. &mdash; The&s;e principles are &s;trongly enforced in the ninth and tenth &s;ections of the Declaration of Rights, which form a fundamental and inviolable part of the Con&s;titution, from which you drive your power, wherein it is declared,</P>
<P N="9">IX. "THAT in all pro&s;ecutions for crimi|nal offences, a man hath a right to be heard by him&s;elf and his Council, to demand the cau&s;e and nature of his accu&s;ation, to be con|fronted with the witne&s;&s;es, to call for evidence in his favour, and a &s;peedy public trial by an impartial jury of the country; without the unanimous con&s;ent of which jury, he cannot be found guilty&mdash;Nor can he be compelled to give evidence again&s;t him&s;elf; nor can any man be ju&s;tly deprived of his liberty, except by the laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers."</P>
<P N="10">X. "THAT the people have a right to

hold them&s;elves, their hou&s;es, papers, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, free from &s;earch or &s;eizure, and therefore warrants without oaths or affirmations fir&s;t made, affording a &s;ufficient foundation for them, and whereby any officer or me&s;&s;enger may be commanded or required to &s;earch &s;u&s;|pected places, or to &s;eize any per&s;on or per&s;ons, his or their property not particularly de&s;cribed, are contrary to that right and ought not to be granted."</P>
<P>How far the&s;e principles have been adhered to, in the cour&s;e of this bu&s;ine&s;s, we &s;hall go on to &s;hew.</P>
<P>UPON the examination of the &s;aid warrant, we find it is, in all re&s;pects, inadequate to the&s;e de&s;criptions, altogether unprecedented in this or any free country, both in its &s;ub&s;tance, and the latitude given to the me&s;&s;engers who were to execute it, and wholly &s;ubver&s;ive of the very Con&s;titution you profe&s;s to &s;upport.&mdash;The only charge on which it is founded, is a recom|mendation of Congre&s;s to apprehend and &s;ecure all per&s;ons who in their general conduct and conver&s;ation have evidenced a di&s;po&s;ition inimi|cal to the cau&s;e of America, and particularly
<PB N="21" REF="015496_0023_0F9985DFB359C080">
naming &s;ome of us,&mdash;but not &s;ugge&s;ting the lea&s;t offence to have been committed by us.</P>
<P>IT authori&s;es the me&s;&s;engers to &s;earch all papers belonging to us, upon a bare po&s;&s;ibility, that &s;omething political may be found, but without the lea&s;t ground for a &s;u&s;picion of the kind.</P>
<P>IT requires papers, relative to the &s;ufferings of the people called Quakers, to be &s;eized, with|out limiting the &s;earch to any hou&s;e, or number of hou&s;es; under colour of which, every hou&s;e in this city, might be broke open.</P>
<P>TO the per&s;ons whom the Congre&s;s have thought proper to &s;elect, the Warrant adds a number of the inhabitants of the city, of whom &s;ome of us are part; without the lea&s;t in&s;inua|tion, that they are within the de&s;cription given by the Congre&s;s, in their recommendation.</P>
<P>IT directs all the&s;e matters to be executed (tho' of the highe&s;t importance to the Liberties of the people) at the di&s;cretion of a &s;et of men, who are under no qualification for the due exe|cution of the office, and are unaccu&s;tomed to
<PB N="22" REF="015496_0024_0F9985E07081F418">
the forms of executing civil proce&s;s, from whence probably, have proceeded the exce&s;&s;es and irregularities committed by &s;ome of them, in divers in&s;tances, by refu&s;ing to give copies of the proce&s;s to the parties arre&s;ted, by deny|ing to &s;ome of us, a rea&s;onable time to con&s;ider of an&s;wers, and prepare for confinement.&mdash;In the ab&s;ence of others, by breaking our de&s;ks and other private repo&s;itories&mdash;and by ran&s;ack|ing and carrying off dome&s;tic papers, printed books, and other matters not within the terms of the Warrant.</P>
<P>IT limits no time for the duration of our impri&s;onment, nor points at any hearing, which is an ab&s;olute requi&s;ite to make a legal Warrant; but confounds in one Warrant, the power to apprehend, and the authority to commit, with|out interpo&s;ing a judicial officer between the parties and the me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, we conceive this Warrant and the proceedings thereupon, to be far more dangerous in its tendency, and a more flagrant violation of every right which is dear to Free|men, than any that can be found in the records of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="015496_0025_0F9985E1278FAF80">BUT when we con&s;ider the u&s;e to which this GENERAL WARRANT has been applied, and the Per&s;ons upon whom it has been execu|ted, <HI>(Who challenge the World to charge them with offence)</HI> it becomes of too great magni|tude to be con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of a Few.&mdash; It is the cau&s;e of every Inhabitant, and may, if permitted to pa&s;s into a Precedent, e&s;tabli&s;h a Sy&s;tem of Arbitrary Power unknown but in the Inqui&s;ition, or the de&s;potic Courts of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>WHAT adds further to this alarming &s;tretch of power is, that we are informed the Vice-Pre&s;ident of the Council, has declared to one of the Magi&s;trates of the City, who called on him to enquire into the Cau&s;e of our confinement, that we were to be &s;ent to Virginia UNHEARD.</P>
<P>SCARCELY could we believe &s;uch a declara|tion could have been made by a per&s;on who fills the &s;econd place in the government, till we were this day confirmed in the melancholy truth by three of the &s;ub&s;cribers, <HI>whom you ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to hear in per&s;on, or by Council.</HI>&mdash;We would remind you of the complaints urged by
<PB N="24" REF="015496_0026_0F9985E1F7FBF478">
numbers of your&s;elves again&s;t the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for condemning the town of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> UNHEARD, and we call upon you to reconcile your <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> conduct with your <HI>then</HI> profe&s;&s;ions, or your repeated declarations in favour of general Liberty.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>In the name therefore of the whole body of the Freemen of Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> who&s;e Liberties are radically &s;truck at in this arbitrary impri&s;on|ment of us, their <HI>unoffending</HI> fellow-citizens: We DEMAND an audience; that &s;o our inno|cence may appear, and per&s;ecution give place to ju&s;tice.&mdash;But if, regardle&s;s of every &s;acred obligation by which men are bound to each other in &s;ociety, and of that Con&s;titution by which you profe&s;s to govern, which you have &s;o loudly magnified for the free &s;pirit it breathes, you are &s;till determined to proceed; be the ap|peal to the righteous judge of all the earth for the integrity of our hearts, and the unparalelled tyranny of <HI>your</HI> mea&s;ures.</P>

<P>THE foregoing Remon&s;trance was delivered to <HI>Thomas Wharton,</HI> junr. Pre&s;ident, &amp;c. la&s;t evening, who promi&s;ed to lay it before Council, and &s;end an an&s;wer to one of the Gentlemen, who delivered it to him this morning; but no an&s;wer has yet been received.</P>
<P>September 5th, half pa&s;t two o'clock, P. M.</P>
<P>THUS the matter re&s;ted till about &s;even o'clock ye&s;terday evening, when in&s;tead of re|turning
<PB N="26" REF="015496_0028_0F9985E3E6A0BBA0">
an an&s;wer to our repeated demand of an hearing, which we &s;till adhere to as our un|doubted right, the Secretary of the Council inclo&s;ed to <HI>William Bradford,</HI> a copy of a new re&s;olve, de&s;iring him to acquaint us with it; wherein, without the lea&s;t mention of &s;upport|ing their in&s;inuations again&s;t us, they &s;hift the ground on which they &s;et out, and propo&s;e a te&s;t to be taken by us, in full &s;atisfaction of all their &s;u&s;picions.&mdash;</P>
<P>TO this re&s;olve we are preparing an an&s;wer, which we intend &s;oon to lay before them: And in the mean time, we beg you will avoid the being influenced by any anonymous publications which our adver&s;aries, to draw our attention from the immediate object before us, may utter again&s;t us, filled with fal&s;ehoods and mi&s;repre|&s;entations, which they may be encouraged to publi&s;h from an a&s;&s;urance that the printers would conceal their names.</P>
<P>OUR attention is now engaged in a mo&s;t im|portant &s;truggle, for civil and religious Liberty; we therefore hope, you will not expect us to wa&s;te that time in refuting &s;uch anonymous performances, which is wholly requi&s;ite for
<PB N="27" REF="015496_0029_0F9985E44BC419A8">
bringing this grand point to a proper conclu&s;ion. We cannot however wholly pa&s;s by a publica|tion in the la&s;t Evening Po&s;t, calculated to throw an odium on the ju&s;t cau&s;e in which we are &s;uffering: It is repre&s;ented in that piece, that the Quakers are the principal objects of re&s;entment, and the cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned is the i&s;&s;uing <HI>"&s;editious publications &s;tiled Te&s;timonies"</HI> one of which they a&s;&s;ert has been un&s;ea&s;onably pub|li&s;hed at two critical periods.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle ray of chri&s;tian charity, would be &s;uf|ficient to &s;hew the uncandid con&s;truction put by that writer upon the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e religious rights &s;ecured by the con&s;titution to every reli|gious &s;ociety of warning, and admoni&s;hing their members to avoid every thing incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles they hold.&mdash;It is well known, that at both the times hinted at, contending armies were endeavouring <HI>within the circle of their yearly meeting,</HI> to procure all per&s;ons that &s;hould come in their way to join them in mili|tary preparations.</P>
<P>THE Te&s;timony of the Quakers is again&s;t all wars and fighting, and again&s;t entering into military engagements of any kind; &s;urely then,
<PB N="28" REF="015496_0030_0F9985E564FE3AE8">
it was the right of the Repre&s;entatives of that Society, to caution their Members from engag|ing in any thing contrary to their Religious Principles. But if it be an offence in tho&s;e who were active in that Publication, what have tho&s;e of us done who are not Members of that Soci|ety, who are of the Church of England (which two denominations comprehend all the &s;ub&s;crib|ers) and who have publi&s;hed NO Te&s;timonies.</P>
<P>BUT this cannot be con&s;idered by the Writer as a dangerous Publication, or why does he re|publi&s;h it in the pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation of pub|lic affairs; &s;urely this charge is a mere pre|tence to vilify a re&s;pectable body of the inha|bitants.</P>
<P>THUS we have furni&s;hed you with a calm, and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate account of our pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances, and we wi&s;h to have it con&s;idered as a vindication of our own characters, and a peace|able, tho' firm a&s;&s;ertion of the unalienable rights of Freemen.</P>
<P>DIFFICULTIES may perhaps await us, but re|lying on the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that Almighty Being, who is the Guardian of the innocent, We pre|pare
<PB N="29" REF="015496_0031_0F9985E5A188A3F8">
to meet them, rather than endanger PUB|LIC HAPPINESS AND FREEDOM by a voluntary &s;urrender of tho&s;e Rights which we have never forfeited.</P>

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> THE foregoing Addre&s;s was pre|pared, and intended for publication in the Even|ing Po&s;t of the 6th in&s;tant; but before we thought proper to deliver it to the Printer, we cho&s;e to have &s;ome conver&s;ation with him; he was &s;ent for, and attended us; we told him we had a paper to publi&s;h in our vindication, with
<PB N="30" REF="015496_0032_0F9985E7B76BFD00">
our names &s;igned, that as we were confin'd up|on &s;ome &s;u&s;picions unknown to us, it was hard we &s;hould be attacked by anonymous writers in the papers, our characters a&s;per&s;ed, and preju|dices excited again&s;t us, when we were de|manding a hearing, which ought to be unbia&s;s'd and impartial. We therefore required of him, as what we thought a matter of right, accord|ing to the rules of every impartial Free Pre&s;s, that he would refrain from publi&s;hing hereafter any anonymous papers reflecting upon us, and that he would acquaint us with the name of the writer of two paragraphs, in the then la&s;t Po&s;t, highly injurious to our characters. To the former he gave us an ab&s;olute promi&s;e to adhere; to the latter he &s;aid, that he could not give up the name without the writer's con&s;ent; that he would go to him, and return with his an&s;wer as &s;oon as he could, at the &s;ame time promi&s;ing, that if we de&s;ired it, he would in&s;ert our Addre&s;s in the Po&s;t of that evening, tho' it would delay it's appearance till &s;ome time the next day: He went away and we have not &s;ince heard from him.

<P>THAT we are now confined by a military guard, having been arre&s;ted and depriv|ed of our Liberty, by order of the Pre&s;ident and Council of Penn&s;ylvania, in con&s;equence of a Re&s;olve made by you, on the 28th day of the la&s;t month, "Recommending to the Execu|tive Powers of the &s;everal &s;tates, to apprehend and &s;ecure all per&s;ons, who have in their general conduct, and conver&s;ation, evidenced a di&s;po&s;i|tion inimical to the cau&s;e of <HI>America,</HI>" and par|ticularly naming us, the &s;ub&s;cribers, "together with all &s;uch papers, in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as may

<OPENER>SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>THAT it is with pain, we find our&s;elves under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity, of again remon&s;trating again&s;t your extraordinary mode
<PB N="39" REF="015496_0041_0F9985EEA4D394F0">
of treating us; when our la&s;t Remon&s;trance was delivered to your Pre&s;ident, he gave ex|pectation to our fellow-citizens who waited on him, that he would lay it before you, and return an an&s;wer&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding which, we have as yet received no an&s;wer what&s;oever to it, but in&s;tead thereof, a paper &s;igned by your Secretary, was delivered to us by <HI>William Brad|ford,</HI> the contents of which we &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion to remark on.</P>
<P>BUT we mu&s;t not omit another letter receiv|ed thro' the &s;ame channel, by which we are confirm'd in the truth of what we had before heard, that on the very day you were addre&s;&s;ed by three of us to <HI>be heard,</HI> and before we were furni&s;hed with a copy of the GENERAL WAR|RANT, you had re&s;olved to bani&s;h us to <HI>Stan|ton,</HI> in the county of <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> a place where you claim no juri&s;diction, and to which we are utter &s;trangers; this re&s;olution formed again&s;t a body of innocent Freemen, while demanding to be <HI>heard,</HI> is, we believe, the fir&s;t in&s;tance of the kind to be found in the hi&s;tory of our country: and, be&s;ides the violent infringement of the laws and con&s;titution which you have engaged to govern by, the
<PB N="40" REF="015496_0042_0F9985EF791AF138">
hard&s;hip is heightened by the particular &s;itua|tion of that country at this time; as it is pub|licly a&s;&s;erted, that the Indians have already commenced ho&s;tilities upon the frontiers of <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI> not very far di&s;tant from the place of our intended bani&s;hment, as tho' you could find no place of &s;ecurity without endangering our lives.</P>
<P>FROM the profe&s;&s;ions you have repeatedly made of your love of Liberty and Ju&s;tice, and the manner in which we have demanded our undoubted rights, we had rea&s;on to expect to have heard from you on the &s;ubject of our la&s;t Remon&s;trance; but we find we were mi&s;taken, and the complaints of injured Freemen &s;till remain unan&s;wered.</P>
<P>WHETHER you imagine we are of too little con&s;equence to be regarded, or expect that con|finement will reduce us to a tame acquie&s;cence with your arbitrary proceedings, we &s;hall not determine; it will not divert our attention from the important object we have in view in behalf of our&s;elves, and our country.&mdash;Nor will &s;ubtle propo&s;als fit only to captivate the unwary, decoy us from the &s;ure ground on which we &s;tand in
<PB N="41" REF="015496_0043_0F9985F024314240">
to a mea&s;ure as illegal, and uncon&s;titutional as <HI>your</HI> GENERAL WARRANT, and <HI>our</HI> oppre&s;&s;ive treatment under it.</P>
<P>THE propo&s;ition contain'd in your re&s;olve of the 5th in&s;t. to di&s;charge us upon taking the Te&s;t "required by law," or the <HI>new Te&s;t fram|ed by your&s;elves</HI> now demand our notice.</P>
<P>AND fir&s;t we would ob&s;erve that if you had a right to make &s;uch a propo&s;ition, we think it very improper to be made to men in our &s;itua|tion. You have fir&s;t deprived us of our Liberty, on one pretence, which finding you are not able to ju&s;tify, you wave, and require as a condition of our enlargement, that we &s;hould confe&s;s our|&s;elves men of &s;u&s;picious characters by doing what ought not to be expected from innocent men. This kind of procedure is not new in hi&s;tory; for tho' the great patriots of the revo|lution found better expedients for the &s;ecurity of their government, than what ari&s;es from oaths of abjuration, yet the annals, both of Old and New-England are &s;tained with accounts of men, in circum&s;tances &s;imilar to our own, dragged before magi&s;trates, on the bare &s;u&s;pi|cion of crimes; of whom Te&s;ts, which they
<PB N="42" REF="015496_0044_0F9985F0E8802230">
con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;crupled to take, have been af|terwards demanded, as the condition of their en|largement.&mdash;But &s;uch examples we &s;hould hope, would not have found patrons among men profe&s;&s;ing to be reformers upon all the plans of civil and religious Liberty, adopted by the free nations of Europe.</P>
<P>IT is &s;trange to us that men intru&s;ted with <HI>Supreme Executive Powers</HI> &s;hould be &s;o regard|le&s;s of the laws you have mo&s;t &s;olemnly engaged to execute, as to require us to do more than tho&s;e very laws enjoin. By the Te&s;t Act every inhabitant may take the Te&s;t, and enjoy all the rights of Freemen, or decline it, and &s;ubmit to a deprivation of &s;ome of them, of which are ex|pre&s;&s;ed in that Act; but no power is given to any officer of ju&s;tice what&s;oever, to tender it to any per&s;on except in particular circum&s;tances, and as the charge again&s;t us is not founded on a breach of that law, it is evident you exceeded your authority in putting it to us. But if after what is pa&s;t, we could be &s;urprized at any thing you do, we &s;hould have been a&s;toni&s;hed at the rapid progre&s;s of your u&s;urpation in a&s;&s;uming Legi&s;lative Powers to your&s;elves, while the A&s;&s;embly was &s;itting under the &s;ame roof. You
<PB N="43" REF="015496_0045_0F9985F1ACFE47B0">
have overturned the only &s;ecurity the Con&s;titu|tion has given the people again&s;t ab&s;olute de&s;|poti&s;m, by attempting to exerci&s;e the authority of framing a Re&s;olve operating as a Law at the &s;ame time, the powers of executing it.</P>
<P>YOUR duty as one branch of the Con&s;titution is confined to the executing the laws as you find them, and does not extend to the making new ones to &s;alve your own irregular conduct. You have undertaken all this by propo&s;ing a new Te&s;t of your own enacting, unknown, to the Laws and Con&s;titution of the Government which you are to execute, un&s;upported by any authority under which you act; and this an <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> Law made to criminate by a refu&s;al, tho&s;e who before were innocent. And if we were in your opinion, &s;uch dangerous per&s;ons, as you, under the &s;anction of the Congre&s;s, have endeavoured to repre&s;ent us, and could not be &s;ecured without &s;ending us to &s;o remote and dangerous part of the country, beyond the limits of your juri&s;diction, how will the public be &s;ecured by our taking either of the Te&s;ts you have propo&s;ed;&mdash;That men of bad principles will &s;ubmit to any Te&s;ts to cover their dange|rous
<PB N="44" REF="015496_0046_0F9985F2FB4917F0">
and wicked purpo&s;es is evident to all who have been conver&s;ant in public affairs.</P>
<P>THE great Lord Hallifax, who in the name of the People of England pre&s;ented the Crown to King William and Queen Mary at the Revo|lution, has expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on this &s;ubject, in the following nervous terms, "As there is no real &s;ecurity to any &s;tate by oaths, &s;o no private per&s;on, much le&s;s &s;tate&s;man would ever order his affairs as relying on it; for no man would ever &s;leep with open doors, or unlock'd-up-trea|&s;ure, or plate, &s;hould all the Town be &s;worn not to rob."</P>
<P>ANOTHER mo&s;t extraordinary proceeding we find in your Secretary's letter, where he &s;ays that <HI>you a&s;ked and received the advice of Congre&s;s,</HI> upon our Remon&s;trance before you determined upon it. What! &s;hall unaccu&s;ed Citizens, de|manding their inherent rights be delayed, or refu&s;ed a Hearing until Congre&s;s can be con|&s;ulted? A Body, who have engaged not to in|terfere in the internal police of the Govern|ment. Perhaps you thought the authority of a recommendation from Congre&s;s would render your arbitrary de&s;igns effectual, and countenance
<PB N="45" REF="015496_0047_0F9985F35FD69AB0">
you in the eyes of the people. We tru&s;t you will be mi&s;taken, and that neither Congre&s;s nor the people will approve your mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>HAVING thus remarked on your propo&s;al, prote&s;ting our innocence, we again repeat our pre&s;&s;ing demand, to be informed of the cau&s;e of our commitment, and to have a hearing in the face of our country, before whom we &s;hall either &s;tand acquitted, or condemned.</P>

<P>We have never been &s;uffered to come before you to evince our innocence, and remove &s;u&s;|picions which you have laboured to in&s;til into the minds of others, and at the &s;ame time knew to be groundle&s;s, altho' Congre&s;s recommended it to you to give us a hearing, and your Pre&s;ident this morning a&s;&s;ured two of our friends we &s;hould have it.</P>

<P>Altho' at the time many of our forefathers were convinced of the truth, which we their de&s;cendants now profe&s;s, great fluctuations and various changes and turnings happened in government, and they were greatly vilified and per&s;ecuted for a firm and &s;teady adherence to their peaceable and inoffen&s;ive principles, yet they were pre&s;erved from any thing tending to

promote in&s;urrections, con&s;piracies, or the &s;hed|ding of blood; and during the troubles which by permi&s;&s;ion of Divine Providence have lat|terly prevailed, we have &s;teadily maintained our Religious Principles in the&s;e re&s;pects, and have not held any corre&s;pondence with the contend|ing parties, as is unju&s;tly in&s;inuated, but are withheld and re&s;trained from being concerned in &s;uch matters, by that Divine Principle of Grace and Truth which we profe&s;s to be our guide and rule through life. This is of more force and obligation than all the Te&s;ts and De|clarations devi&s;ed by men.</P>
<P>AND we who are of the Church of England, are free to declare to you and to the world, that we never have at any time, during the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, either directly or indirectly "com|municated any intelligence whatever to the Commander of the Briti&s;h Forces, or any other per&s;on concerned in public affairs."
