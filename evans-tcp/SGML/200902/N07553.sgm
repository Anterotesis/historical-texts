<HEAD><HI>A REPLY,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_TWO rea&s;ons induce me to addre&s;s the pub|lic at pre&s;ent. The one is, to clear a few plain arguments on a matter of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, from the objections lately made again&s;t them, in a piece call'd <HI>"The Speech of Jo&s;eph Galloway, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &amp;c."</HI> The other is, to an&s;wer the unju&s;t accu&s;ations contain'd in that piece.</P>
<P>To act hone&s;tly, and to be traduc'd, hath been the fate of many men. To bear &s;landers with temper, and to entertain a proper pity or contempt, for their weak or wicked authors, has been the lot of few. I will en|deavour to imitate their example: and by propo&s;ing it to my&s;elf, I hope I &s;hall be able &s;o far to &s;uppre&s;s the re&s;entment naturally ari&s;ing from a &s;en&s;e of unprovok'd injuries, that my vindication may be pre&s;ented not un|acceptably, nor u&s;ele&s;sly, to candid minds.</P>
<P>COULD I be convinced, that men of &s;en&s;e or virtue, would be per&s;uaded or plea&s;ed, by wild declamation or illiberal reflections, I might perhaps be induced to de|fend my&s;elf, in the &s;ame &s;hattered &s;tyle and abu&s;ive lan|guage,
<PB N="2" REF="009640_0005_0F7739404B6F8D20">
with which I have been attacked: but as the&s;e mu&s;t always offend the <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> who&s;e approbation only is worth wi&s;hing for, to Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> I re&s;ign the undi&s;puted glory of excelling in his <HI>favorite</HI> arts&mdash;of <HI>writing confu&s;edly,</HI> and <HI>railing in&s;olently.</HI></P>
<P>Pre&s;umptuous indeed mu&s;t I appear, &s;hould I venture into <HI>the&s;e li&s;ts,</HI> again&s;t a per&s;on who wields the weapons of wordy war&mdash;<HI>the only weapons he dares to wield</HI>&mdash;with &s;o peculiar a dexterity in his exerci&s;e, as to feel no kind of re&s;traint either from <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> or <HI>truth;</HI> the regularity of who&s;e &s;ober di&s;cipline would prove, I pre&s;ume, too great a confinement to this advocate of <HI>freedom.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I perceived, that Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> was hardy e|nough to obtrude on the public a <HI>pretended &s;peech,</HI> of which he never &s;poke one &s;entence in the Hou&s;e, I was not &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that a per&s;on who treated his own character with &s;uch licence, &s;hould not be un&s;par|ing of others. But&mdash;<HI>why</HI> he &s;hould engage in this <HI>pre|po&s;terous</HI> project&mdash;<HI>why</HI> he &s;hould &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly endea|vour to exhibit me as a villain to my country, for &s;peaking my &s;entiments in that place where my country had commanded me to &s;peak them&mdash;<HI>why</HI> he has wan|tonly wounded a man, who never de&s;igned or wi&s;hed <HI>him</HI> an injury; but has always, as far as his power ex|tended, rendered him all the offices of civility&mdash;for <HI>what rea&s;ons,</HI> I &s;ay, he has thus violated the laws of <HI>humanity</HI> and <HI>decency,</HI> his own heart is be&s;t able to de|cide&mdash;The public, with which he endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>his</HI> character, by de&s;troying <HI>that of another,</HI> may perhaps be able to gue&s;s the <HI>&s;ecret cau&s;es,</HI> by which he has been tran&s;ported into &s;uch unju&s;tifiable exce&s;&s;es of rage and rancour again&s;t <HI>me</HI>&mdash;For my part, I &s;hall avoid an enquiry, that would only lead me, I fear, to a painful di&s;covery of the <HI>depravity,</HI> to which the human mind is &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="009640_0006_0F77394107790660">LEAVING then to the impartial world the judgement to be pa&s;&s;ed on Mr. <HI>Galloway's</HI> conduct&mdash;Leaving to <HI>him</HI> the enjoyment of the <HI>&s;olid &s;atisfaction,</HI> that mu&s;t a|ri&s;e from the meritorious exploit of &s;tabbing publicly a reputation, which has hitherto e&s;caped his <HI>in&s;i|dious attempts,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to perform the ta&s;k impo&s;ed on me by his cruelty, and to defend my&s;elf from tho&s;e darts, which with unfriendly hands he has aim'd at <HI>my heart.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the change of our government, after the ad|journment of the a&s;&s;embly in <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, came to be the general &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, the importance of the mea&s;ure filled my mind with the greate&s;t anxiety. A &s;evere fit of &s;ickne&s;s had prevented my attendance when the re&s;olves were pa&s;t: but I con&s;idered that at the next meeting of the Hou&s;e, the duties of the po&s;t which my country had a&s;&s;ign'd me, would call upon me to act a part of more con&s;equence, than perhaps would ever fall to my &s;hare again, in the whole cour&s;e of my life. Mindful of the tru&s;t committed to me, I endeavour'd to under&s;tand a matter on which &s;o much depended.</P>
<P>I SOON perceiv'd, that if a change took place, there were two things to be wi&s;h'd for, which there appear'd to me no probability of obtaining. The fir&s;t was, that the <HI>point</HI> on which we lately differ'd with the governor, and <HI>&s;ome others</HI> which have been earne&s;tly urg'd by for|mer a&s;&s;emblies, &s;hould be determin'd in our favour. The &s;econd was, that our <HI>privileges &s;hould be perfectly &s;ecured.</HI></P>
<P>BUT in&s;urmountable ob&s;tructions &s;eem'd to pre&s;ent them&s;elves, <HI>at this time,</HI> again&s;t the&s;e attempts. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Speech Page 6.</NOTE> <Q>What rea&s;onable hopes of &s;ucce&s;s can we entertain, of hav|ing the&s;e points decided in our favour, while tho&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="009640_0007_0F7739429C3EB680">
mini&s;ters who &s;o repeatedly and warmly have approv'd of the proprietors in&s;i&s;ting on them, are &s;till in power?</Q> Our danger not only is, that the&s;e points will not be decided for us; but, if the proprietors, tir|ed and incen&s;ed, &s;hould think proper to &s;urrender the government and make their own terms with the crown, is it not highly probable, that they have intere&s;t enough to make the change in &s;uch a manner as will fix upon us <HI>forever,</HI> tho&s;e demands which appear &s;o extremely ju&s;t to the pre&s;ent mini&s;ters? Add to this, the <Q>de|plorable misfortune under which we now labour, of having incurr'd the di&s;plea&s;ure of his maje&s;ty and his mini&s;ters.</Q> The&s;e reflections induc'd me to think and to &s;ay&mdash;that <HI>this</HI> is not the proper time to attempt a change of our government.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Galloway,</HI> by way of prelude to his an&s;wer to the&s;e ob&s;ervations, endeavours to &s;hew that I have con|tradicted my&s;elf: but this <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> contradiction is founded on a <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> conce&s;&s;ion, which I never made&mdash; <HI>"of the nece&s;&s;ity of a change".</HI> My <HI>approbation</HI> of a change, if we can enjoy all the advantages we now do, is call'd, <HI>"a confe&s;&s;ion that a change is nece&s;&s;ary".</HI> But certainly it would have been more natural to con&s;true it as it was intended, and as the &s;en&s;e requires&mdash;"that, <HI>if we are to lo&s;e nothing by the change,</HI> I am as willing to be under the immediate government of the crown, as of the proprietors."</P>
<P>AFTER this un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to rai&s;e a contradic|tion, Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> takes the trouble of attacking the "inappo&s;ite in&s;tance", as he calls it, relating to the duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> This in&s;tance was mentioned to con|firm a preceding ob&s;ervation; and Mr. <HI>Galloway,</HI> in attempting to an&s;wer it, <HI>unluckily for him&s;elf,</HI> points out and enforces the very truth for which it was adduced. He &s;ays, "the duke failed; and no wonder; for he
<PB N="5" REF="009640_0008_0F77394366A9D7A8">
landed at a <HI>time</HI> when the king was &s;upported in the <Q>warme&s;t manner by the parliament, and no one cir|cum&s;tance to promi&s;e him &s;ucce&s;s.</Q> Thus, I &s;ay,&mdash; our attempt is made at a <HI>time</HI> when the proprietors are &s;upported in the warme&s;t manner by the crown, and its mini&s;ters; and no one circum&s;tance to promi&s;e us &s;ucce&s;s".&mdash; But, &s;uppo&s;e the duke had waited till the parliament did <HI>no longer</HI> &s;upport the King; but, when they and the whole nation, in the utmo&s;t dread of popery and arbitrary power, were looking round with impatient terror for a deliverer; and when many cir|cum&s;tances promi&s;ed that nobleman &s;ucce&s;s; is it evi|dent that he would not <HI>then</HI> have &s;ucceeded, or that he would have been taken and put to death? Or, if king <HI>William</HI> had made his attempt, before the nation was properly alarmed, is it certain that the revolution would have been accompli&s;hed with &s;uch amazing facili|ty? Ra&s;hne&s;s ruined the one. Caution crowned the other. This is all, I intended to prove.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Galloway</HI> then proceeds, and <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> that all the determinations of the mini&s;try, were mi&s;takes occa|&s;ioned by proprietary mi&s;repre&s;entations. He then <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> that the&s;e determinations were &s;olely owing to the influence of two friends of the proprietors, lately decea&s;ed: And la&s;tly he <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> that now there will be a <HI>total</HI> alteration in mini&s;terial re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>&s;uppo&s;itions,</HI> I acknowledge, are as good &s;ecu|rities as any we have, that the grand points controver|ted between us and the proprietors, will, in ca&s;e of a change, be decided in our favour, or that our privi|leges will be pre&s;erved. But &s;till they &s;eem to be too &s;anguine. Let us remember with what <HI>unanimity</HI> the mini&s;try at different times have expre&s;&s;ed their re&s;ent|ment of our conduct; and, that it is only <HI>gue&s;s-work</HI> to imagine, their re&s;olutions were dictated by two men.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="009640_0009_0F77394409482CC8">OF one thing we are <HI>&s;ure</HI>&mdash;that we are in the <HI>ut|mo&s;t di&s;credit</HI> with the king and his mini&s;ters. The late re&s;olves prove it. Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> however flatters him&s;elf, <Q>that the prejudices again&s;t us are not &s;o ineradicably fixed, but they may be ea&s;ily overcome, and the province re&s;tored to her former credit.</Q> Happy &s;hould I be, if I could perceive the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing. By <HI>what means</HI> the&s;e prejudices are to be overcome, we are not informed; nor can I conceive. Men of great abilities, and of the mo&s;t perfect ac|quaintance with our public affairs, have been em|ployed to remove the force of the&s;e mi&s;repre&s;entati|ons, as they are called. Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> and Mr. <HI>Charles,</HI> our Agents &s;pent &s;everal years in combating the&s;e prejudices; and, even Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> him&s;elf, as I have been told, <HI>elucidated</HI> the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e with his <HI>u&s;ual per&s;picuity,</HI> in reams of writing. Yet after all the&s;e great labours, his maje&s;ty and his mini&s;ters &s;till retained their former &s;entiments. Hence, I fear, that any future efforts for this purpo&s;e, <Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pretended Speech,&mdash;page 30.</NOTE> <HI>will be</HI> &s;wallowed up, and &s;acrificed <HI>(as Mr.</HI> Galloway <HI>mo&s;t elegantly expre&s;&s;es it) AT</HI> the &s;hrine of proprietary in|&s;tructions, and the mea&s;ures of power.</Q> In &s;hort, that they will be but <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Qu.</HI> What <HI>Idea</HI> can be formed of an <HI>"ideal &s;hadow?"</HI> and what may be the meaning <HI>"of the &s;hrine of the mea&s;ures of power?"</HI></NOTE> <HI>"ideal &s;hadows,"</HI> and <HI>chime|rical "notions."</HI></P>
<P>IN confident expectation of the&s;e improbabilities, Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> is willing to ri&s;que the <HI>perpetuating</HI> tho&s;e demands, which have been con&s;tantly made by the proprietors&mdash;at a <HI>time,</HI> when <HI>we are certain</HI> that the crown and its mini&s;ters look on the&s;e demands as high|ly ju&s;t and rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>ONE of his arguments for our riding po&s;t in this af|fair is&mdash;<Q>that there are many new colonies to be
<PB N="7" REF="009640_0010_0F7739457B860598">
&s;ettled now, and that it would di&s;courage <HI>the&s;e</HI> &s;et|tlements, if <HI>our</HI> privileges were to be taken away.</Q></P>
<P>'TIS true it will convince the emigrants, they are not to have &s;uch privileges as were granted to <HI>us;</HI> or, if they <HI>have,</HI> and &s;hall hereafter <HI>petition for a change,</HI> that they will be taken from them.</P>
<P>BUT this information, I imagine, will be no di&s;cour|agement.&mdash;There is not the &s;ame <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>America</HI> was then &s;o little known, that it was thought the &s;evere&s;t kind of bani&s;hment to &s;end people over to the colonies.</NOTE> rea&s;on to grant, nor to wi&s;h for privileges now, that exi&s;ted in the per&s;ecuting days of <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd. Grants of land on &s;mall quit-rents&mdash;furni&s;hing the nece&s;&s;aries of life for the fir&s;t out&s;et&mdash;bounties on labour&mdash;and immunities from taxes for &s;ome years&mdash;with the common liberties of other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects&mdash;will do the bu&s;ine&s;s, without the privileges of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Galloway,</HI> before he quits <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pretended Speech&mdash;page 21.</NOTE> "this wi&s;e policy of &s;ettling the exten&s;ive newly acquired dominions" as he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, takes the opportunity of making an <HI>hi&s;torical flouri&s;h</HI>&mdash;but unfortunately furni&s;hes "<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. pa. 26.</NOTE> irre|fragable demon&s;trations" that he is utterly unacquaint|ed with the &s;ubject, on which he &s;peaks.</P>
<P>MR. FRANKLIN read in the Hou&s;e, a &s;hort extract from Lord <HI>Clarendon's</HI> life, relating to <HI>Barbados.</HI> Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> catched it as it fell from the learned member, and now confidently a&s;&s;erts&mdash;"that the colony of <HI>Bar|bados</HI> had, in the opinion of the able&s;t council, <HI>forfeited her charter privileges</HI>&mdash;And yet upon this policy only, her privileges were pre&s;erved."</P>
<P>HE referrs to Lord <HI>Clarendon's</HI> life, for this curious anecdote. What then mu&s;t a man think of Mr. <HI>Gallo|way,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="009640_0011_0F773945DCBF8710">
who looks into the book, and finds&mdash;that the colony of <HI>Barbados</HI> did not forfeit any right&mdash;that &s;uch an opinion was never given&mdash;and that there is not a word relating to her <HI>charter privileges.</HI> Yet this is the truth.</P>
<P>THE fact was this. <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t granted the i&s;land of <HI>Barbados</HI> by patent to the earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI>&mdash;he di|ed&mdash;his &s;on lea&s;ed it to lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> for twenty-one years; appointing him governor, and re&s;erving a mo|iety of the profits to him&s;elf&mdash;the civil war broke out&mdash;ended&mdash;<HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd was re&s;tor'd&mdash;there being eight or nine years of lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>'s lea&s;e to come, he pray'd the king to give him a commi&s;&s;ion to be governor for that time&mdash;But the i&s;land was now much chang'd&mdash;it was compleatly &s;ettled during the troubles&mdash;and <HI>chiefly by officers of the king's army</HI>&mdash;&s;o that now it was of another con&s;ideration and value than it had been&mdash;<HI>the king's cu&s;toms</HI> yearly amounted to <HI>a very large &s;um</HI>&mdash;The planters were greatly alarmed at the thought of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s Life&mdash;vol.

<P>I THINK every man in the province <HI>except Mr. Gallo|way,</HI> will immediately di&s;cover whether the ca&s;e he has quoted, will &s;trengthen his rea&s;oning or mine.</P>
<P>ANOTHER of Mr. <HI>Galloway's</HI> arguments is&mdash; <Q>that the proprietary e&s;tate is daily increa&s;ing, and thus their influence will increa&s;e; and therefore they will be more likely in future, to oppo&s;e with &s;ucce&s;s any mea&s;ures that may be taken again&s;t their op|pre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>TO fini&s;h this argument, he clo&s;es it with an <HI>imagina|ry contradiction</HI> of mine, in my &s;aving, "This is not the proper time for a change," and afterwards declaring, <Q>that we are not to expect more &s;ucce&s;s, becau&s;e the <HI>proprietaries</HI> will have more dignity, more power; and, as they will think, more law on their &s;ide.</Q></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Galloway</HI> certainly takes delight in mi&s;takes, or he would never have committed &s;o gro&s;s an error as he has done here. I &s;aid&mdash;it could not be expected, that our &s;ucce&s;s would be greater when our <Q>opponents become more <HI>numerous,</HI> and will have more dignity, more power, and, as they will think, more law on their &s;ide.</Q>
This was intended to prove, that we might find it more difficult after a change, to contend for the pre&s;ervation of our privileges, with the <HI>crown</HI> and the <HI>clergy,</HI> (the <HI>opponents</HI> here meant) than with the proprietors. But Mr. <HI>Galloway,</HI> with great ad|dre&s;s, by changing the word <HI>opponents</HI> for <HI>proprietaries,</HI> creates a contradiction for his own <HI>diver&s;ion,</HI> and the <HI>deception</HI> of his readers.</P>

<PB N="14" REF="009640_0017_0F77394ACDD66778">
Mr. <HI>Galloway's own principles</HI> being proved&mdash;I return to the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs.</P>
<P>IT is univer&s;ally believed, that the pre&s;ent mini&s;try are de&s;irous of ve&s;ting the government of this province advantageou&s;ly in the crown. Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> has fre|quently &s;aid it. If this be the ca&s;e, how fair an oppor|tunity is pre&s;ented to the proprietors of gratifying their re&s;entment, if they entertain any again&s;t the province, and &s;ecuring their intere&s;t at the &s;ame time, by entering into a contract with the crown, and fixing, by an act of parliament, tho&s;e points, in which the mini&s;try have con&s;tantly &s;upported them&mdash;<HI>upon all &s;ucceeding ages?</HI></P>
<P>MANY words are unnece&s;&s;ary in &s;o clear a ca&s;e as this is. Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> allows, the proprietors have &s;ome &s;en&s;e, and that they under&s;tand their own inter|e&s;t. The &s;entiments of the mini&s;try have been decla|red in their favor. From thence I think it may be taken for granted, that the proprietors either will not con&s;ent to a change&mdash;or that their con&s;ent will be founded on a perfect &s;ecurity given them for their de|mands, which appear &s;o ju&s;t to the king and mini&s;|try. What may facilitate this mea&s;ure is, the propo&s;al of the a&s;&s;embly&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pretended Speech pa. 5.</NOTE>" that a <HI>full equivalent</HI> be made to "the proprietors" upon their parting with the go|vernment. How far the&s;e words may be con&s;trued to extend, will appear from this con&s;ideration. With the <HI>approbation of the crown</HI> the proprietors now in&s;i&s;t on certain points which, in their opinion, tend to pro|mote their intere&s;ts. This, the authority ve&s;ted in them at pre&s;ent, enables them to do. If they are dive&s;ted of this authority, without any &s;tipulations for &s;ecuring their intere&s;ts <HI>hereafter,</HI> as well as they are at <HI>this time,</HI> it will be &s;aid that a <HI>full equivalent</HI> is not made for the power they re&s;ign. This &s;ecurity will therefore without
<PB N="15" REF="009640_0018_0F77394B89987778">
doubt, be required&mdash;and that requi&s;ition may not ap|pear &s;o unrea&s;onable in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> as it does here.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>full equivalent</HI> comprehends &s;omething more than the &s;ettlement of the&s;e points. The government of it&s;elf is very valuable&mdash;and &s;urely we &s;hall not de&s;ire the king to pay the equivalent out of his own pocket. If the change therefore is made, I don't que&s;tion but it will be thought highly rea&s;onable&mdash;<HI>that we &s;hould pay for the ble&s;&s;ing, which we &s;o earne&s;tly reque&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ituation of our affairs being &s;uch as has been de&s;cribed, I could not perceive any nece&s;&s;ity "impel|ling" us to &s;eize this unhappy period, to plunge this province into convul&s;ions, that might while &s;he was thus di&s;ordered, be attended with the wor&s;t con&s;e|quences. A gentler remedy appeared to me a properer remedy.</P>
<P>BUT here Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> exclaims&mdash;<Q>Shall we pa|tiently wait untill proprietary influence &s;hall be at an end? Shall we &s;ubmit to proprietary demands?</Q> By no means! What I de&s;ire, is, vigorou&s;ly to oppo&s;e tho&s;e demands; and to try the force of that influence, WITHOUT RISQUING TOO MUCH IN THE CONTEST.</P>
<P>I THEREFORE made a propo&s;al to the Hou&s;e, of a ve|ry moderate nature, which I had the plea&s;ure of finding highly approved by a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late &s;peaker.</NOTE> gentleman, who&s;e acknowledg|ed integrity, patrioti&s;m, abilities, and experience will always give weight to his &s;entiments with every impar|tial per&s;on. The propo&s;al was&mdash;"that we &s;hould de&s;ire his maje&s;ty's judgment, on the point that occa|&s;ioned the late unhappy difference between the two branches of the legi&s;lature." By taking this &s;t;ep, we &s;hould have di&s;covered the &s;en&s;e of the mini&s;try on our

late di&s;putes&mdash;on other important points which have been controverted with our governors&mdash;and re&s;pect|ing our privileges.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;hould have known what &s;ucce&s;s would at|tend us in any future attempt to effect a change&mdash;and what method would be mo&s;t agreeable to his maje&s;ty. But in the pre&s;ent mode of proceeding, we have acted with great zeal, I grant&mdash;but we are quite ignorant what the event will be, and whether the cen&s;ures be&s;tow|ed on the proprietors, may not be thought in <HI>Great-Bri|tain</HI> to be aimed through <HI>them,</HI> at the king. In &s;hort, we embark in an enterprize of the highe&s;t importance; and then look about us to &s;ee how it may be carried on. In&s;tead of wandring through a &s;torm in the dark, with &s;o &s;acred a charge in our cu&s;tody&mdash;I thought it would have been better to have waited, 'till the tempe&s;t was a little abated&mdash;or, at lea&s;t, to have procured &s;ome <HI>light</HI> to guide us through the &s;urrounding dangers.</P>
<P>I SHALL now con&s;ider the <HI>manner</HI> in which the pre|&s;ent attempt to change our government is made.</P>

When the a&s;&s;embly was deliberating on a &s;tep that &s;eemed to me likely to bring di&s;credit and lo&s;s upon us, would it have become me to have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed my opinion? No!

attempt</Q>&mdash;Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> grants it; and appeals to, tho&s;e re&s;olves for my confu&s;ion. How is this charge &s;upported? Why, the re&s;olves mention&mdash;"public hou&s;es&mdash;commi&s;&s;ions to judges during plea&s;ure&mdash; and the great danger of a military force in a proprietary government"&mdash;as grievances. In like manner they mention the point lately controverted. Very well! The <HI>contents</HI> of the re&s;olves are <HI>now proved.</HI>&mdash;But there &s;till remains one point &s;lipped over in &s;ilence&mdash;<HI>Why</HI> were the&s;e re&s;olves <HI>now</HI> made? The increa&s;e of public hou&s;es had frequently been complained of before.&mdash;Commi&s;|&s;ions during good behaviour have always been wi&s;hed for.&mdash;The e&s;tabli&s;hment of a military force has been often attempted in the mid&s;t of war, when it was va&s;tly more nece&s;&s;ary than at this time.&mdash;But never 'till <HI>now</HI> has there been an attempt to change the government. More ob&s;ervations I think unnece&s;&s;ary. Impartial per|&s;ons who read the me&s;&s;ages and re&s;olves&mdash;and con&s;i|der <HI>&s;ome other circum&s;tances</HI> generally known&mdash;will be able to di&s;cover the TRUE CAUSE of the pre&s;ent at|tempt&mdash;and to judge, whether it may be ju&s;tly attri|buted to pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>any kind.</HI> It his maje&s;ty and his mi|ni&s;ters, who&s;e pre&s;ent opinion of us is allowed to be extremely unfavorable, &s;hould be induced by our late behaviour, to think us a ra&s;h, turbulent people&mdash;it will be a misfortune to be deplored by all lovers of their country.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd objection again&s;t the <HI>manner</HI> of proceed|ing, was the <HI>incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> in which we &s;hould be involv|ed. This incon&s;i&s;tency is twofold. In the fir&s;t place, our di&s;&s;ention with the governor, and this extraordinary attempt in con&s;equence of it, may be thought by the king and the mini&s;try to have ari&s;en on a matter already determined by the crown. Hence our <HI>unwillingne&s;s</HI> to comply with the <HI>royal plea&s;ure,</HI> &s;ignifyed to us on this head, may be called <HI>a very improper foundation</HI> of a re|que&s;t
<Q><PB N="21" REF="009640_0024_0F773951B23AC3C0">
to be more immediately &s;ubjected to the royal plea&s;ure.</Q> But this objection is ea&s;ily obviated by <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing</HI> that the king and mini&s;try will exactly agree with the a&s;&s;embly in con&s;truing the controverted &s;tipu|lation. I &s;incerely hope they may; as our con&s;truc|tion appears to me extremely rea&s;onable and equitable. But, of this agreement in &s;entiments I de&s;ired to have &s;ome proof before we proceeded any further. We have frequently been di&s;appointed in our warme&s;t expecta|tions. In public as well as in private life, he that ne|ver doubts, will often be wrong.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place&mdash;there appeared to me an <HI>in|con&s;i&s;tency,</HI> in reque&s;ting a change of government from the king&mdash;and yet in&s;i&s;ting on the pre&s;ervation of privileges derogatory of the royal rights.</P>
<P>WE certainly prefer in our minds one of the&s;e things to the other.&mdash;Either to continue as we are&mdash;or to change, tho' we lo&s;e our privileges. If his maje&s;ty will not accept of the government in the &s;ame &s;tate, in which it has been held by the proprietors, what &s;hall be our choice? I don't imagine, that even Mr. <HI>Galloway,</HI> tho' he ventures to &s;ay "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pretended Speech pa. 21.</NOTE> We have no cau&s;e to dread a change if all "my fears &s;hould prove realities," will dare to propo&s;e a direct renunciation of our rights.

If then his maje&s;ty &s;hall be &s;o <HI>"unrea|&s;onable"</HI> as to in&s;i&s;t upon exerci&s;ing his authority, in ca&s;e of a change, as fully in this province, as in any other under his immediate government&mdash;and we in|&s;i&s;t that he &s;hall not; the bargain breaks off&mdash;"and the wor&s;t con&s;equence is (according to Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI>)

<P>A MEASURE in which the happine&s;s of &s;o many thou|&s;ands is involved, ought not therefore to have been pur|&s;ued in &s;o ha&s;ty and unguarded a manner. <HI>Precautions</HI> &s;hould have been taken. <HI>Securities</HI> &s;hould have been obtained.

<P>The duke of SULLY being a <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> was appointed by his ma&s;ter, <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>fourth</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> to pre&s;ide in a general a&s;&s;embly of the <HI>Prote&s;|tants,</HI> which was called to meet at <HI>Chatelleraut.</HI>&mdash;The duke was <HI>their faithful friend</HI> through his whole life, and &s;trictly attached to them by <HI>principle;</HI> but the warmth of their temper led them into many things, <HI>in this a&s;&s;embly,</HI> in which he could not join with them&mdash;without offer|ing violence to his own &s;entiments&mdash;and integrity.&mdash;</P>
<P>The following is the account he gives of his conduct. <Q>A <HI>common prejudice</HI> prevails among all &s;orts of religion; a man is never &s;uppo&s;ed to be a <HI>&s;incere profe&s;&s;or</HI> of the one he has embraced, unle&s;s he &s;up|ports it <HI>ob&s;tinately,</HI> even in <HI>&s;uch points,</HI> where it is mo&s;t vi&s;ibly <HI>wrong.</HI></Q> <HI>The &s;ame remark may perhaps be found true in all parties.</HI> <Q>Upon this footing, I confe&s;s, the method I was determined to pur&s;ue, might from <HI>&s;ome per&s;ons,</HI> draw upon me the epithets of <HI>fal&s;e brother, de&s;erter,</HI> and if they plea&s;e, <HI>traytor:</HI> However, it was not the approbation of <HI>&s;uch as tho&s;e,</HI> that I propo&s;ed to obtain, but of per&s;ons, who, <HI>of whatever party or religion they were,</HI> would in their judgement of <HI>my conduct,</HI> pre&s;erve the ballance of <HI>equity</HI> and <HI>di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s.</HI> If ever <HI>religion</HI> admits of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>policy,</HI> it ought to be of a policy <HI>pure, &s;imple,</HI> and <HI>upright</HI> as <HI>it&s;elf;</HI> any other may indeed <HI>appear</HI> to <HI>&s;erve</HI> it, but does not in <HI>reality,</HI> and &s;ooner or later <HI>never fails to ruin it.</HI></Q></P>

<P>HAD I intended this, I &s;hould not have been the <HI>only man</HI> in the Hou&s;e, who <HI>con&s;tantly refu&s;ed</HI> to a&s;&s;ent to the &s;upply bill, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> the money emitted by it, was made a legal tender in payment of all demands "except proprietary rents,"&mdash;when <HI>that exception</HI> might have been &s;afely extended (as was granted by the mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed members) to the <HI>rents of all other per&s;ons</HI>&mdash; who would then have been <HI>as well</HI> &s;ecured as the proprietors, and a di&s;tinction in their favour alone, avoided.</P>
<P>ONE thing more I beg leave to mention, &s;ince Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> compels me to &s;peak of my&s;elf. I was ap|pointed to carry the bill to the governor the &s;econd time for his a&s;&s;ent, after he had once refu&s;ed it. This was long before the change of government was talked of. On my delivering it, &s;ome conver&s;ation aro&s;e between us on the &s;ubject, Mr. <HI>Shippen</HI> the &s;ecretary being pre&s;ent. As the pa&s;&s;age of the bill was of the utmo&s;t importance to his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and the good of the public, I took the liberty, though my acquaintance with the governor was very &s;light, of mentioning &s;everal rea&s;ons to prove, that the a&s;&s;embly's con&s;truction of the di&s;|puted &s;tipulation was extremely equitable; con&s;i&s;tent with the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of explaining a &s;entence capa|ble of two meanings; and therefore ought to be admit|ted&mdash;and that his honour's conduct in pa&s;&s;ing the bill, as it then was framed, would not be di&s;approved of in <HI>England.</HI> I further added, that I was per&s;waded, his refu&s;al would throw every thing into the greate&s;t confu&s;ion</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="009640_0040_0F7739608727D920">BEING &s;oon after taken ill, and confined to my room, &s;o anxious was I to prevent any difference at that time between the governor and a&s;&s;embly, that I &s;ent for a gentleman, whom I knew to be intimately acquainted with the governor; and urging every thing I could think of, to convince him that our bill ought to be pa&s;&s;ed as we had formed it, I intreated him to go to the governor, and endeavour to prevail on him to give his a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>I HOPE <HI>this</HI> cannot be called the conduct of a man influenced by "mi&s;chievous pa&s;&s;ions de&s;tructive of pub|lic liberty."</P>
<P>ANOTHER charge brought again&s;t me by Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> is, that I neglected my duty of attending in the Hou&s;e, and never &s;poke my &s;entiments till it was too late.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Galloway</HI>'s behaviour in making this charge, is a plain proof <HI>to what lengths</HI> he will proceed, in hopes of injuring <HI>me.</HI> The fir&s;t time, &s;ince I have been a repre&s;entative of this province, that a change of go|vernment was mentioned and debated in the a&s;&s;embly, was on Saturday the 24th day of March la&s;t, on the governor's &s;ending down to them his me&s;&s;age ab&s;olutely refu&s;ing to pa&s;s the &s;upply bill, unle&s;s the &s;tipulation was literally complied with. <HI>That day,</HI> the a&s;&s;embly's an&s;wer was compo&s;ed and &s;ent&mdash;"the frequent motions, with the &s;olemn debate" Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> talks of, made&mdash;the re&s;olves pa&s;t&mdash;and the Hou&s;e adjourned to the 14th of May.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Galloway mu&s;t be con&s;cious,</HI> that this day, and the day before, I was confined to my chamber, and mo&s;tly to my bed, by a &s;evere attack of the fever and ague.

<P>THIS &s;tate of my health at that time, being a fact well known to many per&s;ons, and particularly to Mr. <HI>Galloway,</HI> how <HI>cruel</HI> and <HI>unju&s;t</HI> is it to blame me for not attending, when it was impo&s;&s;ible&mdash; and when, if it had been po&s;&s;ible, <HI>I had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion,</HI> that any thing of &s;uch va&s;t importance would come into con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>ON the meeting of the Hou&s;e, the 14th day of la&s;t <HI>May,</HI> according to their adjournment, I con&s;tantly at|tended <HI>every day,</HI> untill this important matter was de|termined, except on <HI>Monday</HI> the 21&s;t&mdash;on which day there was no Hou&s;e, only eighteen members meet|ing, Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> and many others being ab&s;ent. The following days, the petition for a change came in&mdash; were read&mdash;as other petitions were&mdash;lay on the table&mdash;and not a word &s;poken on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>Thus</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s went on till <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 23d, when I was prevented <HI>for the fir&s;t time</HI> from attending the Hou&s;e, by a fever&mdash;which, as it was very injurious to my health, would al&s;o, if Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI>'s charitable and humane wi&s;hes could prevail, prove de&s;tructive to my reputation. <HI>This day</HI> the matter was <HI>&s;tarted. In vain</HI> did the &s;peaker recommend the deferring to take any re&s;olution, till the Hou&s;e was more full&mdash;and the ab&s;ent members <HI>then in town,</HI> could attend&mdash;He de&s;ired that the affair might be put off <HI>to the next day&mdash; in vain</HI>&mdash;the debate was begun&mdash;quickly de|termined &mdash;a committee appointed to prepare a draught of the petition&mdash;that draught made&mdash; brought in&mdash;pre&s;ented&mdash;read&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="009640_0042_0F7739626617D0D8">THE next day, tho' &s;till extremely indi&s;po&s;ed, I at|tended&mdash;and was &s;urpri&s;ed to find &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence</HI> had been done in &s;o &s;hort a time&mdash;and though I could have wi&s;hed that <HI>&s;uch a &s;tep</HI> had not been taken, without allowing me, and every other member, <HI>of who&s;e attendance there was any proba|bility,</HI> an opportunity of offering our &s;entiments; yet I comforted my&s;elf with reflecting, that though it had been re&s;olved, "that a petition &s;hould be drawn," yet it was not re&s;olved "that any petition &s;hould be pre&s;ent|ed," and that I &s;hould be at liberty to offer my opinion hereafter. I was determined therefore to attend dili|gently; and to take the <HI>fir&s;t opportunity,</HI> which would be on the &s;econd reading of the petition, to oppo&s;e it. This I was induced to do, by con&s;idering, that if I did not &s;ay any thing, till the que&s;tion was put for <HI>tran|&s;cribing,</HI> or <HI>&s;igning</HI> in order to be pre&s;ented, it would look very odd for me to be &s;ilent &s;o long, and that it would an&s;wer no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, on the &s;econd reading of the petition, which was the <HI>fir&s;t opportunity I ever had,</HI> &s;ince the change of government was attempted, I &s;poke again&s;t it.</P>
<P>THE only objection <HI>then</HI> made by Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> and every other member who &s;poke on the occa&s;ion, was&mdash;that I had offered my &s;entiments <HI>too &s;oon</HI> to the Hou&s;e&mdash;and that I &s;hould have <HI>&s;taid</HI> for the que&s;tion to <HI>tran&s;cribe</HI> or <HI>&s;ign</HI> the petition.</P>
<P>THAT I did not act with any &s;tupid and u&s;ele&s;s re|&s;erve in lying by till this time, was never dreamt of by any member who knew, <HI>why</HI> I had been detained at home, whenever I <HI>was</HI> detained.</P>
<P>HOW vain is his attempt who &s;trives to plea&s;e <HI>all men?</HI> Or indeed to plea&s;e one man at <HI>all times?</HI> Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI>

and others <HI>then</HI> &s;aid, that I &s;poke <HI>too &s;oon.</HI> He and &s;ome more <HI>now</HI> &s;ay, I &s;poke <HI>too late.</HI> Why too late? Were not my arguments as well under&s;tood <HI>then,</HI> and had they not the <HI>&s;ame force,</HI> as if they had been u&s;ed be|fore? And if they proved the mea&s;ure to be <HI>dangerous</HI> and <HI>improper,</HI> ought they not <HI>in a matter of &s;uch impor|tance to the public,</HI> to have been as much regarded, as if they were <HI>one day older?</HI></P>
<P>IF this affair had not been <HI>&s;o quickly decided,</HI> I never &s;hould have been charged with omitting to &s;peak in time. But I mu&s;t not quit Mr. <HI>Galloway.</HI> What mu&s;t the public think of a man who dares to abu&s;e them by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t deceptions, with the pious inten|tion of injuring another? He &s;ays "that during the time of the <HI>&s;everal debates</HI> re&s;pecting the change of go|vernment, I <HI>&s;eldom</HI> attended, and was ab&s;ent when the important one came on, which i&s;&s;ued in the re&s;olve, to adjourn and con&s;ult the people."</P>
<P>YET the candid Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> knows&mdash;that there never was any debate in the a&s;&s;embly, &s;ince I have been a member, re&s;pecting the change of government&mdash; untill that which i&s;&s;ued in the re&s;olve to adjourn&mdash; and <HI>that I was then ill.</HI> Again, he &s;ays, "at the next meeting, (meaning that in <HI>May) &s;everal motions</HI> were made to bring this re&s;olution to an i&s;&s;ue, and after <HI>great deliberation,</HI> it was re&s;olved by a majority of 27 to 3, that a committee &s;hould be appointed to bring in the petition to his maje&s;ty to re&s;ume the powers of go|vernment.&mdash;But at none of the&s;e debates and re&s;olu|tions was I pre&s;ent, tho' I well <HI>knew,</HI> or at lea&s;t had great rea&s;on to <HI>expect this bu&s;ine&s;s was in continual agita|tion."</HI></P>
<P>YET the correct Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> knows, that there ne|ver was a motion&mdash;or debate&mdash;or re&s;olution, concern|ing

this matter, upon the meeting of the hou&s;e in <HI>May</HI>&mdash; untill <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 23d day of the month, when I was taken &s;ick, as has been mentioned&mdash;and that <HI>I at|tended as diligently as him&s;elf till that day.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Account of the time when every tran&s;action pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e&mdash;and of my attendance, is taken from the <HI>minutes</HI> of a&s;&s;embly, and the <HI>book</HI> for entring the attendance of the members&mdash;both which I have carefully looked over, in the pre&s;ence of Dr. <HI>Moore,</HI> the clerk, who therefore is perfectly acquainted with the truth of every thing I have averred.</P>

<P>MR. <HI>Galloway</HI> al&s;o accu&s;es me of having promi&s;ed him a copy of my &s;peech, and of not performing my promi&s;e. Here he is egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken. I told him he &s;hould have the copy that night it was delivered, <HI>if I could get it ready.</HI> The hou&s;e broke up late in the evening. He &s;oon after called upon me. It was not ready. He told me it would be <HI>too late,</HI> if he had it not &s;oon. I did not then under&s;tand <HI>his meaning,</HI> as I did not in the lea&s;t apprehend, the mo&s;t important matter that ever came before the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, was to be decided with le&s;s deliberation than is generally be&s;towed on things of much &s;lighter moment. Next morning I took the copy to the Hou&s;e in my pocket. No one called for it. I did the &s;ame in the afternoon. The like &s;ilence was ob&s;erved. I did not chu&s;e to &s;hew any forwardne&s;s in forcing it on tho&s;e, who &s;eemed willing to forget it. Had I acted other|wi&s;e, I &s;hould have been called impudent and conceit|ed, by tho&s;e who are fond of be&s;towing epithets.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Galloway</HI> &s;ays, "that I attempted to deliver my objections again&s;t the mea&s;ure <HI>ore tenus;</HI> but find|ing every thing I offered judiciou&s;ly and &s;en&s;ibly refut|ed by &s;everal members, I was obliged to retreat to my

&s;peech in writing, which after a &s;hort introductory apo|logy, I read in a manner, not the mo&s;t deliberate."</P>
<P>AS to the la&s;t part of this whim&s;ical charge, I &s;hall not pretend to give any an&s;wer; becau&s;e that would be in &s;ome mea&s;ure allowing Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> capable of judging, what is a "deliberate manner" of &s;peaking.</P>
<P>AS to the fir&s;t part&mdash;any man but Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> would have di&s;covered <HI>why</HI> I began to &s;peak, without recurring to my notes. The re&s;olves were pa&s;t&mdash; and the petition ordered to be drawn in my ab&s;ence. I never had heard the change &s;poke of in the hou&s;e&mdash; and did not know but by information of others, the rea&s;ons by which the members had been influenced. Before I offered my &s;entiments, it was therefore nece&s;|&s;ary for me to di&s;cover the arguments that would be u&s;ed again&s;t me. On the information I had received, I had prepared my an&s;wer; but to make this an&s;wer appear with propriety, I thought it requi&s;ite to have the arguments of tho&s;e who de&s;ired a change, repeated before the hou&s;e. I threw out general objections, and de&s;ired to know what rea&s;ons could be tho't &s;ufficient to engage the hou&s;e in &s;o hazardous a mea&s;ure? Then the "judicious and &s;en&s;ible members" Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> mentions, and he among them&mdash;for that phra&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e, is his way of complimenting him&s;elf&mdash;di&s;|covered all the arguments on which they relied.&mdash;They proved to be the &s;ame I expected; and I "retreated to my &s;peech," which was prepared to an&s;wer them.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t objection made by Mr. <HI>Galloway,</HI> of which I &s;hall take notice, is, "that the &s;peech, as printed, is different from that delivered&mdash;and that the preface &s;ufficiently <HI>demo&s;trates,</HI> by who&s;e hands it has been dre&s;t up, and with what views it has been publi&s;hed."</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="009640_0047_0F773966D59763B8">HERE he is again mi&s;taken. The printed &s;peech is exactly the &s;ame with that I pronounced, except the corrections, and additions I made to compleat the &s;en&s;e, the evening before it was to be delivered to the Mem|bers, as is above mentioned&mdash;and except &s;ome &s;light alterations in a few places. <HI>I further declare,</HI> that I have not received the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance from any per&s;on, in compo&s;ing or correcting it; not even &s;o much as the addition of a &s;ingle word; and that no man ever &s;aw it, or knew that I had written it, except my clerk, who tran&s;cribed it&mdash;untill it was delivered in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>AS to the preface, it makes no <HI>"demon&s;trations"</HI> that can affect <HI>me.</HI> Finding that Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI> and his emi&s;&s;aries were traducing me in every company, and mi&s;repre&s;enting every thing I had &s;aid&mdash;I thought the&s;e a&s;per&s;ions might be removed, by laying before the public, the rea&s;ons by which I had been induced to act as I did. This con&s;ideration had the more weight with me, on receiving a letter from &s;ome gentlemen in this city, de&s;iring a copy of the &s;peech.</P>
<P>THEY being my con&s;tituents&mdash;and men of the cleare&s;t characters, I thought it my duty to comply with their reque&s;t. I &s;ent a copy to them&mdash;and they had it printed with &s;uch a title, and in &s;uch a manner, as they thought proper, <HI>without ever con&s;ulting me;</HI> which could not conveniently be done as I was out of town.&mdash;For immediately after delivering the copy, I was obliged to go into the country for my health. I went to the <HI>Jer&s;eys.</HI> While I was there, the preface was written, and printed. I never &s;aw it.&mdash;I never was made acquainted with its contents, till it was publi&s;hed. I do not even know at this time who wrote it, but by common report.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="009640_0048_0F77396751F0C600">EVERY thing I have &s;aid on the&s;e la&s;t heads, is known to be true, by my friends; who&s;e virtue and good opinion I too much revere, to appeal to them as witne&s;&s;es, if I was not con&s;cious of the <HI>&s;incerity</HI> with which I &s;peak.</P>
<P>THUS have I <HI>faithfully</HI> laid before the public, my whole conduct relating to the change of our govern|ment, and the rea&s;ons on which it was founded.
