<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>THE celebrating the prai&s;es of the dead, is an argument &s;o worn out by long and frequent u&s;e; and now be|come &s;o nau&s;eous, by the flattery that u&s;ually attends it, that it is no won|der if funeral orations, or panegyrics, are more con&s;idered for the elegancy of &s;tyle, and finene&s;s, of wit, than for the authority they carry with them as to the truth of matters of fact. And yet I am not hereby deterred from meddling with this kind of argument, nor from handling it with all the plainne&s;s I can: delivering only what I my&s;elf heard and &s;aw, without any borrowed ornament.</P>
<P>I do ea&s;ily fore&s;ee how many will be engaged for the &s;upport of their
<PB N="iv" REF="028377_0003_0FD8DB42531306B0">
impious maxims and immoral practi|ces, to di&s;parage what I am to write. Others will cen&s;ure it, becau&s;e it comes from one of my profe&s;&s;ion, too many &s;uppo&s;ing us to be induced, to frame &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es for carrying on what they are plea&s;ed to call <HI>Our Trade.</HI> Some will think I dre&s;s it up too arti|ficially, and others, that I pre&s;ent it too plain and naked.</P>
<P>But being re&s;olved to govern my|&s;elf by the exact rules of truth, I &s;hall be le&s;s concerned in the cen&s;ures I may fall under. It may &s;eem liable to great exception, that I &s;hould di&s;clo&s;e &s;o many things, that were di&s;cover|ed to me, if not under the &s;eal of con|fe&s;&s;ion, yet under the confidence of friend&s;hip; but this noble lord him&s;elf not only relea&s;ed me from all obliga|tion of this kind, when I waited on him in his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, a few days be|fore he died, but gave it me in charge not to &s;pare him in any thing which I thought might be of u&s;e to the living; and was not ill plea&s;ed to be laid open,
<PB N="v" REF="028377_0004_0FD8DB439A6E4BE0">
as well in the wor&s;t as in the be&s;t and la&s;t part of his life, being &s;o &s;incere in his repentance, that he was not un|willing to take &s;hame to him&s;elf, by &s;uffering his faults to be expo&s;ed for the benefit of others.</P>
<P>I write with one great di&s;advantage &mdash;that I cannot reach his chief de&s;ign, without mentioning &s;ome of his faults: but I have touched them as tenderly as the occa&s;ion would bear; and I am &s;ure with much more &s;oftne&s;s than he de&s;ired, or would have con&s;ented to, had I told him how I intended to ma|nage this part. I have related no|thing with per&s;onal reflections on any others, concerned with him, wi&s;hing rather that they them&s;elves, reflecting on the &s;en&s;e he had of his former di&s;|orders, may be thereby led to for&s;ake their own; than that they &s;hould be any ways reproached by what I write: and therefore though he u&s;ed very few re&s;erves with me, as to his cour&s;e of life, yet &s;ince others had a &s;hare in mo&s;t parts of it, I &s;hall relate nothing
<PB N="vi" REF="028377_0005_0FD8DB4839C4D950">
but what more immediately concerned him&s;elf: and &s;hall &s;ay no more of his faults, than is nece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;trate his repentance.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion that led me into &s;o particular a knowledge of him, was an intimation given me by a gentle|man of his acquaintance, of his de&s;ire to &s;ee me. This was &s;ometime in October, 1679, when he was &s;lowly recovering out of a great di&s;ea&s;e. He had under&s;tood that I often attended on one well known to him, that died the &s;ummer before; he was al&s;o then entertaining him&s;elf in that low &s;tate of his health, with the fir&s;t part of the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Reformation</HI> then newly come out, with which he &s;eem|ed not ill plea&s;ed: and we had acci|dentally met in two or three places &s;ome time before.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the motives that led him to call for my company. After I had waited on him once or twice, he grew into that freedom with me,
<PB N="vii" REF="028377_0006_0FD8DB499B47F688">
as to open to me all his thoughts, both of religion and morality, and to give me a full view of his pa&s;t life, and &s;eemed not unea&s;y at my frequent vi&s;its. So till he went from London, which was in the beginning of April, I waited on him often.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I heard how ill he was, and how much he was touched with the &s;en&s;e of his former life, I writ to him, and received from him an an|&s;wer, that, without my knowledge, was printed &s;ince his death; from a copy which one of his &s;ervants con|veyed to the pre&s;s. In it there is &s;o unde&s;erved a value put on me, that it had been very indecent for me to have publi&s;hed it: yet that mu&s;t be attribu|ted to his civility and way of breed|ing: and indeed he was particularly known to &s;o few of the clergy, that the good opinion he had of me, is to be imputed only to his unacquaintence with others.</P>
<P>My end of writing, is &s;o to di&s;charge
<PB N="viii" REF="028377_0007_0FD8DB4E9D84AFB8">
the la&s;t commands this lord left on me, as that it may be effectual to awaken tho&s;e who run on to all the exce&s;&s;es of riot; and that in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e heats, which their lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions rai&s;e in them, they may be a little wrought on by &s;o great an in&s;tance, of one who had run round the whole circle of luxury; and as <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays of him&s;elf, <HI>What&s;oever his eyes de&s;ired, he kept it not from them; and withheld his heart from no joy.</HI> But when he looked back on all that on which he had wa&s;ted his time and &s;trength, he e&s;teemed it vanity and vexation of &s;pi|rit: though he had both as much na|tural wit, and as much acquired by learning, and both as much improved by thinking and &s;tudy, as perhaps any libertine of the age. Yet when he reflected on all his former cour&s;es, even before his mind was illuminated with better thoughts, he counted them madne&s;s and folly.</P>
<P>But when the powers of religion came to operate on him, then he ad|ded
<PB N="ix" REF="028377_0008_0FD8DB51B9C955C0">
a dete&s;tation to the contempt he formerly had of them, &s;uitable to what became a &s;incere penitent, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;o clear and &s;o calm a manner, &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his fail|ings towards his maker and his re|deemer, that as it wrought not a lit|tle on tho&s;e that were about him; &s;o, I hope, the making it public may have a more general influence, chiefly on tho&s;e on whom his former conver&s;ati|on might have had ill effects.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to give his cha|racter as fully as I could take it: for I who &s;aw him only in one light, in a &s;edate and quiet temper, when he was under a great decay of &s;trength and lo&s;s of &s;pirits, cannot give his picture with that life and advantage that others may, who knew him when his parts were more bright and lively: yet the compo&s;ure he was then in, may perhaps be &s;uppo&s;ed to balance any abatement of his u&s;ual vigour which the declination of his health brought him under.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="028377_0009_0FD8DB5424DE3B80">I have written this di&s;cour&s;e with as much care, and have con&s;idered it as narrowly as I could. I am &s;ure I have &s;aid nothing but truth. I have done it &s;lowly, and often u&s;ed my &s;e|cond thoughts in it, not being &s;o much concerned in the cen&s;ures which might fall on my&s;elf, as cautious that nothing &s;hould pa&s;s, that might ob&s;truct my only de&s;ign of writing, which is the doing what I can towards the reform|ing a loo&s;e and lewd age.</P>
<P>And if &s;uch a &s;ignal in&s;tance, con|curring with all the evidence that we have for our mo&s;t holy faith, has no effect on tho&s;e who are running the &s;ame cour&s;e, it is much to be feared they are given up to a reprobate &s;en&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LIEE and DEATH OF JOHN, EARL OF ROCHESTER.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN WILMOT earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> was born in April, anno domini 1648. His father was <HI>Henry</HI> earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> but be&s;t know by the title of lord <HI>Wil|mot,</HI> who bore &s;o great a part in all the late wars, that mention is often made of him in the hi&s;tory. He had the chief &s;hare in the honour of the pre&s;er|vation
<PB N="14" REF="028377_0011_0FD8DB595CB11F90">
of his maje&s;ty that now reigns, after <HI>Worche&s;ter</HI>-fight, and the convey|ing him from place to place, till he happily e&s;caped into <HI>France;</HI> but dy|ing before the king's return, he left his &s;on little other inheritance, than the honour and title derived to him, with the preten&s;ions &s;uch eminent &s;ervices gave him to the king's favour. The&s;e were carefully managed by the great prudence and di&s;cretion of his mother, a daughter of that noble and ancient family of the <HI>St. John's</HI> of <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> &s;o that his education was carried on in all things &s;uitably to his quality.</P>
<P>When he was at &s;chool he was an ex|traordinary proficient at his book; and tho&s;e &s;hining parts which have &s;ince ap|peared with &s;o much lu&s;tre, began then to &s;hew them&s;elves: He acquired the Latin to &s;uch perfection, that to his dy|ing-day he retained a great reli&s;h for the finene&s;s and beauty of that tongue; and was exactly ver&s;ed in the incom|parable authors that writ about <HI>Augu&s;|tus</HI>' time, whom he read often with that peculiar delight, which the greate&s;t wits have ever found in tho&s;e &s;tudies.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="028377_0012_0FD8DB5AE02B0FC8">When he went to the univer&s;ity, the general joy that over-ran the whole nation upon his maje&s;ty's re&s;toration but was not regulated with that &s;obri|ety and temperance, that became a &s;e|rious gratitude to God for &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing, produced &s;ome of its ill ef|fects on him: He began to love the&s;e di&s;orders too much.</P>
<P>His tutor was that eminent and pi|ous divine Dr. <HI>Blanford,</HI> afterwards promoted to the &s;ees of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI> And under his in&s;pection, he was committed to the more imme|ate care of Mr. <HI>Phineas Berry,</HI> a fel|low of <HI>Wadham</HI> college, a very learn|ed and good natured man; whom he afterward u&s;ed with much re&s;pect, and rewarded as became a great man. But the humour of that time wrought &s;o much on him, that he broke off the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies, to which no means could ever effectually recal him; till when he was in <HI>Italy</HI> his governor Dr. <HI>Balfour,</HI> a worthy and learned man, now a celebrated phy&s;ician in <HI>Scotland,</HI> his native country, drew him
<PB N="16" REF="028377_0013_0FD8DB5EB155DA30">
to read &s;uch books as were mo&s;t likely to bring him back to love learning and &s;tudy: and he often acknowledged to me, in particular three days before his death, how much he was obliged to love and honour this his governor, to whom he thought he owed more than to all the world, next after his parents for his care and &s;idelity of him, while he was under his tru&s;t.</P>
<P>But no part of it affected him more &s;en&s;ibly, than that he engaged him by many tricks (&s;o he expre&s;&s;ed it) to delight in books and readings. So that ever after he took occa&s;ion in the inter|vals of tho&s;e woeful extravagancies that con&s;umed mo&s;t of his time to read much: and though the time was ge|nerally but indifferently employed, for the choice of the &s;ubjects of his &s;tudies was not always good, yet the habitual love of knowledge, together with the&s;e fits of &s;tudy, had much awakened his under&s;tanding and prepared him for better things, when his mind &s;hould be &s;o far changed as to reli&s;h them.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="028377_0014_0FD8DB6258E4B9F8">He came from his travels in the 18th year of his age, and appeared at court with as great advantages as mo&s;t ever had. He was a graceful and well &s;ha|ped per&s;on, tall, and well made, if not a little too &s;lender. He was ex|actly well bred, and what by a mode&s;t behaviour natural to him, what by a civility become almo&s;t as natural, his conver&s;ation was ea&s;y and obliging. He had a &s;trange vivacity of thought, and vigour of expre&s;&s;ion. His wit had a &s;ubtility and &s;ublimity both that were &s;carce imitable. His &s;tyle was clear and &s;trong. When he u&s;ed fi|gures they were very lively, and yet far enough out of the common road. He had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the an|cient and modern wit, and of the mo|dern <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> as well as the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> He loved to talk and write of &s;peculative matters, and did it with &s;o fine a thread that even tho&s;e that hated the &s;ubjects that his fancy run upon, yet could not but be charmed with his way of treating them. <HI>Boileau</HI> among the <HI>French,</HI> and
<PB N="18" REF="028377_0015_0FD8DB66C0D6DBE8">
<HI>Cowley</HI> among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> wits, were tho&s;e he admired mo&s;t, Sometimes o|ther mens thoughts mixed with his com|po&s;ures, but that flowed rather from the impre&s;&s;ions they made on him when he read them, by which they came to return upon him as his own thoughts, than that he &s;ervilely copied them from any. For few men ever had a bold|er flight of fancy more &s;teadily go|verned by judgment than he had. No wonder a young man &s;o made and &s;o improved was very acceptable in a court.</P>
<P>Soon after his coming thither, he laid hold on the fir&s;t occa&s;ion that offer|ed, to &s;hew his readine&s;s to hazard his life in the defence and &s;ervice of his, country. In the Winter of 1665, he went with the earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> to &s;ea, when he was fent to lie for the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t India</HI> fleet; and was in the <HI>Re|venge</HI> commanded by Sir <HI>Thomas Tid|diman,</HI> when the attack was made on the port of <HI>Bergen</HI> in <HI>Norway,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hips having got into that port. It was as de&s;perate an attempt as ever was
<PB N="19" REF="028377_0016_0FD8DB6858DBB560">
made: during the whole action, the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> &s;hewed as brave and and as re&s;olute courage as was po&s;&s;ible. A per&s;on of honour told me he heard the Lord <HI>Clifford,</HI> who was in the &s;ame &s;hip, often magnify his courage at that time very highly. Nor did the rigours of the &s;ea&s;on, the hardne&s;s of the voyage, and the extreme dangers he had been in, deter him from running the like on the very next occa&s;ion. For in the Summer following he went to &s;ea again, without communicating his de&s;ign to his neare&s;t relations. He went aboard the &s;hip commanded by Sir <HI>Edward Spragge,</HI> the day before the great &s;ea-fight of that year. Al|mo&s;t all the volunteers that were in the &s;ame &s;hip were killed. Mr. <HI>Middleton,</HI> (brother to Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton</HI>) was &s;hot in his arms. During the action, Sir <HI>Edward Spragge</HI> not being &s;atisfied with the behaviour of one of the cap|tains, could not ea&s;ily find a per&s;on who would cheerfully venture through &s;o much danger, to carry his commands to that captain. This lord offered him|&s;elf
<PB N="20" REF="028377_0017_0FD8DB69F71BC5D8">
to the &s;ervice; and went in a lit|tle boat through all the &s;hot, and deli|vered his me&s;&s;age, and returned back to Sir <HI>Edward:</HI> which was much com|mended by all that &s;aw it. He thought it nece&s;&s;ary to begin his life with the&s;e demon&s;trations of his courage in an e|lement and way of fighting, which is acknowledged to be the greate&s;t trial of clear and undaunted valour.</P>
<P>He had &s;o entirely laid down the in|temperance that was growing on him before his travels, that at his return he hated nothing more. But falling into company that loved the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, he was, though not without difficulty, and by many &s;teps, brought back to it again. And the natural heat of his fan|cy being inflamed by wine, made him &s;o extravagantly plea&s;ant, that many to be more diverted by that humour, &s;tudied to engage him in deeper and deeper intemperance; which at length did &s;o entirely &s;ubdue him, that, as he told me, for five years together he was continually drunk: not all the while under the vi&s;ible effect of it, but his
<PB N="21" REF="028377_0018_0FD8DB6DFA8D8080">
blood was &s;o inflamed, that it was not in all that time cool enough to to be perfectly ma&s;ter of him&s;elf. This led him to &s;ay and do many wild and un|accountable things: by this, he &s;aid, he had broke the firm con&s;titution of his health, that &s;eemed &s;o &s;trong, that nothing was too hard for it; and he had &s;uffered &s;o much in his reputa|tion, that he almo&s;t di&s;paired to reco|ver it.</P>
<P>There were principles in his natural temper, that being heightened by that heat carried him to great exce&s;&s;es&mdash;a violent love of plea&s;ure, and a di&s;po&s;i|tion to extravagant mirth. The one involved him in great &s;en&s;uality; the other led him to many odd adventures and frolicks, in which he was oft in hazard of his life. The one being the &s;ame irregular appetite in his mind, that the other was in his body, which made him think nothing diver|ting that was not extravagant. And though in cold blood he was a generous and good natured man, yet he would go far in his heats, after any thing that
<PB N="22" REF="028377_0019_0FD8DB6F2AEECC88">
might turn to a je&s;t or matter of diver|&s;ion.</P>
<P>He &s;aid to me, He never improved his intere&s;t at court, to do a premeditated mi&s;chief to other per&s;ons. Yet he laid out his wit very freely in libels and &s;atires, in which he had a peculiar ta|lent of mixing his wit with his malice, and fitting both with &s;uch apt words, that men were tempted to be plea&s;ed with them; from thence his compo|&s;ures came to be ea&s;ily known, for few had &s;uch a way of tempering the&s;e to|gether as he had. So that when any thing extraordinary that way came out, as a child is fathered &s;ometimes by its re&s;emblance, &s;o was it laid at his door as its parent and author.</P>
<P>The&s;e exerci&s;es in the cour&s;e of his life were not always equally plea&s;ant to him; he had often &s;ad intervals and &s;evere reflections on them. And though then he had not the&s;e awakened in him from any principle of religion, yet the horror that nature rai&s;ed in him, e&s;pe|cially in &s;ome &s;ickne&s;&s;es, made him too ea&s;y to recieve &s;ome ill principles,
<PB N="23" REF="028377_0020_0FD8DB70DC379A30">
which others endeavoured to po&s;&s;e&s;s him with; &s;o that he was &s;oon brought to &s;et him&s;elf to &s;ecure and fortify his his mind again&s;t that, by di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it of all he could of the belief or appre|hen&s;ions of religion.</P>
<P>The licentiou&s;ne&s;s of his temper, with the bri&s;kne&s;s of his wit, di&s;po&s;ed him to love the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e who divided their time between lewd acti|ons and irregular mirth. And &s;o he came to bend his wit and direct his &s;tu|dies and endeavours to &s;upport and &s;trengthen the&s;e ill principles both in him&s;elf and others.</P>
<P>An accident fell out after this, which confirmed him more in the&s;e cour&s;es. When he went to &s;ea in the year 1665 there happened to be in the &s;ame &s;hip with him, Mr. <HI>Mountague,</HI> and another gentleman of quality; the&s;e two, the former e&s;pecially, &s;eemed per&s;uaded that they &s;hould never return into <HI>En|gland.</HI> Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> &s;aid, he was &s;ure of it: the other was not &s;o po&s;itive. The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and the la&s;t of the&s;e, entered into a formal engage|ment,
<PB N="24" REF="028377_0021_0FD8DB77A89FE318">
not without ceremonies of reli|gion, that if either of them died, he &s;hould appear and give the other notice of the future &s;tate, if there was any. But Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> would not enter into the bond. When the day came that they thought to have taken the <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet in the port of <HI>Bergen,</HI> Mr. <HI>Mountague,</HI> though he had &s;uch a &s;trong pre&s;age in his mind of his approaching death, yet he generou&s;ly &s;taid all the while in a place of the greate&s;t danger. The other gentleman &s;ignalized his courage in a mo&s;t undaunted manner, till near the end of the action, when he fell on a &s;udden into &s;uch a trembling that he could &s;carce &s;tand: and Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> going up to him to hold him up, as they were in each others arms, a cannot ball killed him outright, and carried away Mr. <HI>Mountague's</HI> belly, &s;o that he died within an hour after.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> told me that the&s;e pre&s;ages they had in their minds, made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on him, that there were &s;eparated beings; and that the &s;oul, either by a natural &s;agacity,
<PB N="25" REF="028377_0022_0FD8DB7AF1100F00">
or &s;ome &s;ecret notice communicated to it, had a &s;ort of divination. But that gentleman's never appearing was a great &s;nare to him, during the re&s;t of his life. Though when he told me this he could not but acknowledge, it was an unrea&s;onable thing to think, that beings in another &s;tate were not under &s;uch laws and limits, that they could not command their own motions, but as the Supreme Power &s;hould order them; and that one who had &s;o cor|rupted the natural principles of truth, as he had, had no rea&s;on to expect that &s;uch an extraordinary thing &s;hould be done for his conviction.</P>
<P>He al&s;o told me of another odd pre|&s;age that one had of his approaching death in the lady <HI>Warre,</HI> his mother in law's hou&s;e. The chaplain dreamed that &s;uch a day he &s;hould die, but being by all the family put out of the belief of it, he had almo&s;t forgot it; till the even|ing before at &s;upper, there being thir|teen at table, according to fond con|ceit that one of the&s;e mu&s;t &s;oon die, one of the young ladies pointed to him

that he was to die. He remembering his dream fell into &s;ome di&s;order, and the lady <HI>Warre</HI> reproving him for his &s;uper&s;tition, he &s;aid, he was confident he was to die before morning; but he being in perfect health it was not much minded. It was <HI>Saturday</HI>-night, and he was to preach the next day. He went to his chamber and &s;at up late, as appeared by the burning of his candle, and had been preparing his notes for his &s;ermon, but was found dead in his bed the next morning. The&s;e things he &s;aid, made him inclined to believe the &s;oul was a &s;ub&s;tance di&s;tinct from matter; and this often returned into his thoughts.

He &s;aid his rea&s;on and judgment were &s;o clear and &s;trong, that from thence he was fully per&s;uaded that death was not the &s;pending or di&s;&s;olution of the &s;oul, but

only the &s;eparation of it from matter. He had in that &s;ickne&s;s great, remor&s;es for his pa&s;t life, but he afterwards told me, they were rather general and dark horrors, than any convictions of fin|ning again&s;t God. He was &s;orry he lived &s;o as to wa&s;te his &s;trength &s;o &s;oon, or that he had brought &s;uch an ill name upon him&s;elf; and had an agony in his mind about it, which he knew not well how to expre&s;s. But at &s;uch times though he complied with his friends in &s;uffering divines to be &s;ent for, he &s;aid, he had no great mind to it: and that it was but a piece of his breeding, to de&s;ire them to pray by him, in which he joined but little him&s;elf.</P>

<P>For morality, he freely owned to me, that though he talked of it as a fine thing, yet this was only becau&s;e he thought it a decent way of &s;peaking, and that as they went always in cloaths, though in their frolicks they would have cho&s;en &s;ometimes to have gone naked, if they had not feared the peo|ple; &s;o that though &s;ome of them found it nece&s;&s;ary for human life to talk of of morality, yet he confe&s;&s;ed they car|ed not for it, further than the reputa|tion of it was nece&s;&s;ary for their credit, and affairs; of which he gave me ma|ny in&s;tances, as their profe&s;&s;ing and &s;wearing friend&s;hip, where they hated morality; their oaths and imprecati|ons in their addre&s;&s;es to women, which they intended never to make good; the plea&s;ure they took in defaming in|nocent per&s;ons, and &s;preading fal&s;e re|ports of &s;ome, perhaps in revenge, be|cau&s;e they could not engage them to comply with their ill de&s;igns: the de|light they had in making people quar|rel;

<P>Such had been his principles and practices in a cour&s;e of many years, which had almo&s;t quite extingui&s;hed the natural propen&s;ities in him to ju&s;tice and virtue. He would often go in to the country, and be for &s;ome months whol|ly employed in &s;tudy, or the &s;allies of his wit; which he came to direct chief|ly to &s;atire. And this he often defen|ded to me; by &s;aying there were &s;ome people who could not be kept in order or admoni&s;hed but in this way. I re|plied, That it might be granted that a grave way of &s;atire, was &s;ometimes no unprofitable way of reproof. Yet they who u&s;ed it only out of &s;pite, and mixed lies with truth, &s;paring nothing that mightadorn their poems, or gratify their

To this he an&s;wered, A man could not write with life, unle&s;s he was heated by revenge: for to make a &s;a|tire without re&s;entment on the cold no|tions of <HI>philo&s;ophy,</HI> was as if a man would in cold blood, cut mens' throats, who had never offended him. And he &s;aid, The lies in the&s;e libels came often in as ornaments that could not be &s;pa|red without &s;poiling the beauty of the poem.</P>
<P>For his other &s;tudies, they were di|vided between the comical and witty writings of the ancients and moderns, the <HI>Roman</HI> authors, and books of phy|&s;ic, which the ill &s;tate of health he was fallen into made more nece&s;&s;ary to him&s;elf; and which qualified him for an odd adventure which I &s;hall but ju&s;t mention. Being under an unlucky ac|cident

which obliged him to keep out of the way, he di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o that his neare&s;t friends could not have known him, and &s;et up in <HI>Tower-&s;treet,</HI> for an <HI>Italian</HI> mountebank, where he practi&s;ed phy&s;ick for &s;ome weeks not without &s;ucce&s;s. In his latter years he read books of hi&s;tory more. He took plea&s;ure to di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf as a porter, or as a beggar; &s;ometimes to follow &s;ome mean amours, which for the variety of them he affected. At other times merely for diver&s;ion he would go about in odd &s;hapes, in which he acted his part &s;o naturally, that e|ven tho&s;e who were in the &s;ecret, and &s;aw him in the&s;e &s;hapes, could per|cieve nothing by which he might be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>I have now made the de&s;cription of his former life and principles, as fully as I thought nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer my end in writing. And yet with tho&s;e re&s;erves, that I hope I have given no ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence to any. I have &s;aid nothing but what I had from his own mouth, and have avoided the

It is their reformation, and not their di&s;grace, I de&s;ire: this tender con&s;ideration of o|thers has made me &s;uppre&s;s many re|markable and u&s;eful things he told me.

But I hope tho&s;e that know how much they were engaged with him in his ill cour&s;es, will be &s;ome|what touched with this tenderne&s;s I expre&s;s towards them; and be thereby the rather induced to reflect on their ways, and to con&s;ider without preju|dice or pa&s;&s;ion, what a &s;en&s;e this noble lord had of their ca&s;e, when he came at la&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect upon his own.</P>

I was not long in his company when he told me, He &s;hould treat me with more freedom than he had ever u&s;ed to men of my profe&s;&s;ion. He would conceal none of his princi|ples from me, but lay his thoughts open without any di&s;gui&s;e; nor would he do it to maintain debate or &s;hew his wit, but plainly tell me what &s;tuck with him. And he prote&s;ted to me, that he was not &s;o engaged to his old maxims, as to re&s;olve not to change, but if he could be convinced, he would choo&s;e rather to be of another mind. He &s;aid, he would impartially weigh what I &s;hould lay before him, and tell me freely when it did convince him, and when it did not. He expre&s;&s;ed this di&s;po&s;ition of mind to me in a man|ner &s;o frank, that I could not but be|lieve him, and be much taken with his way of di&s;cour&s;e. So we entered in|to

almo&s;t all the parts of natural and revealed religion, and of morality. He &s;eemed plea&s;ed, and in a great mea&s;ure &s;atisfied, with what I &s;aid on many of the&s;e heads. And though our free&s;t conver&s;ation was when we were alone, yet upon &s;everal occa&s;ions other per|&s;ons were witne&s;&s;es to it. I under|&s;tood from many hands, that my com|pany was not di&s;ta&s;teful to him, and that the &s;ubjects about which we talk|ed mo&s;t, were not unacceptable. And he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf often not ill plea|&s;ed with many things I &s;aid to him, and particularly when I vi&s;ited him in his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s: &s;o that I hope it may not be altogether unprofitable, to pub|li&s;h the &s;ub&s;tance of tho&s;e matters a|bout which we argued &s;o freely, with our rea&s;oning upon them. And per|haps what had &s;ome effects on him, may be not altogether ineffectual upon others.</P>
<P>I followed him with &s;uch arguments as I found were mo&s;t likely to prevail with him. And my not urging other rea&s;ons proceeded not from any di&s;tru&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="028377_0032_0FD8DB9406933658">
I had of their force, but from the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing tho&s;e that were mo&s;t proper for him. He was than in a low &s;tate of health, and &s;eemed to be &s;lowly recovering from a great di&s;ea&s;e. He was in the milk diet, and apt to fall into hectic-fits; any accident weak|ened him; &s;o that he thought he could not live long. And when he went from <HI>London,</HI> he &s;aid, He believed he &s;hould never come to town more. Yet during his being in town, he was &s;o well that he went often abroad, and had great vivacity of &s;pirit. So that he was under no &s;uch decay that either dark|ened or weakened his under&s;tanding; nor was he any way troubled with the &s;pleen or vapours, or under the power of melancholy.</P>
<P>What he was then, compared to what he had been formerly, I could not &s;o well judge, who had &s;een him but twice before. Others have told me they perceived no difference in his parts. This I mention more particu|larly that it may not be thought that melancholy or want of &s;pirits made
<PB N="36" REF="028377_0033_0FD8DB9865D16968">
him more inclined to recieve any im|pre&s;&s;ions; for indeed I never di&s;covered any &s;uch thing in him.</P>
<P>Having thus opened my way to the heads of our di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall next mention them. The three chief things we talked about, were morality, natu|ral religion, and revealed religion, Chri&s;tianity in particular. For mora|lity he confe&s;&s;ed, he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of it, both for the government of the world, and the pre&s;ervation of health, life and friend&s;hip; and was very much a&s;hamed of his former practices, ra|ther becau&s;e he had made him&s;elf a bea&s;t, and brought pain and &s;ickne&s;s upon his body, and had &s;uffered much in his reputation, than from any deep &s;en&s;e of a Supreme Being, or another &s;tate. But &s;o far this went with him that he firmly re&s;olved to change the cour&s;e of his life, which he thought he &s;hould effect by the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, and had not a few, no le&s;s &s;olid and plea|&s;ant notions concerning the folly and madne&s;s of vice. But he confe&s;&s;ed he
<PB N="37" REF="028377_0034_0FD8DB9A10536D98">
had no remor&s;e for his pa&s;t actions or offences again&s;t God, but only as in|juries to him&s;elf and to mankind.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;ubject I &s;hewed him the effects of philo&s;ophy, for reforming the world. That it was a matter of &s;peculation, which but few either had the lei&s;ure or the capacity to enquire into. But the principle that mu&s;t re|form mankind, mu&s;t be obvious to every man's under&s;tanding. That philo&s;ophy in matters of morality, be|yond the great lines of our duty, had no very certain fixed rule, but the le&s;&s;er offices and in&s;tances of our duty went much by the fancies of men, and cu&s;toms of nations; and con&s;equently could not have authority enough to bear down the propen&s;ities of nature, appetite or pa&s;&s;ion. For which I in|&s;tanced in the&s;e two points.</P>
<P>The one was about that maxim of the Stoics, to extirpate all &s;orts of pa&s;&s;ion and concern for any thing. That, take it by one had, &s;eemed de&s;i|rable, becau&s;e if it could be accom|pli&s;hed, it would make all the acci|dents
<PB N="38" REF="028377_0035_0FD8DB9E16302D00">
of life ea&s;y; but I think it can|not, becau&s;e nature after all our &s;tri|ving again&s;t it, will &s;till return to it|&s;elf. Yet on the other hand it di&s;&s;ol|ved the bonds of nature and friend|&s;hip, and &s;lackened indu&s;try which will move but dully, without an in|ward heat, and if it delivered a man of many troubles, it deprived him of the chief plea&s;ures of life which ari&s;e from friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The other was concerning the re|&s;traint of plea&s;ure, how far that was to go. Upon this, he told me the two maxims of his morality then were; that he &s;hould do nothing to the hurt of any other, or that might prejudice his own health. And he thought that all plea&s;ure, when it did not in|terfere with the&s;e, was to be indulged as the gratification of our natural ap|petites. It &s;eemed unrea&s;onable to imagine the&s;e were put into a man on|ly to be re&s;trained, or curbed to &s;uch a narrowne&s;s. This he applied to the free u&s;e of wine and women.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="028377_0036_0FD8DBA09B1405A8">To this I an&s;wered, that if appe|tites being natural, was an argument for indulging them, then the revenge|ful might as well alledge it for mur|der, and the covetous for &s;tealing, who&s;e appetites are no le&s;s keen on tho&s;e object&s; and yet it is acknow|ledged that the&s;e appetites ought to be curbed. If the difference is urged from the injury another per&s;on re|ceives, the injury is as great, if a man's wife is defiled, or his daughter corrupted: and it is impo&s;&s;ible for a man to let loo&s;e his appetites to va|grant lu&s;ts, and not tran&s;gre&s;s in the&s;e particulars. So there was no curing the di&s;orders that mu&s;t ri&s;e from thence but by regulating the&s;e appetites. And why &s;hould we not as well think that God intended our bruti&s;h and &s;en&s;ual appetites &s;hould be governed by our rea&s;on, as that the fiercene&s;s of bea&s;ts &s;hould be managed and tamed by the wi&s;dom, and for the u&s;e of man? So that it is no real ab&s;urdity, to grant that the&s;e appetites were put into men, on purpo&s;e to exerci&s;e their rea&s;on in the re&s;traint and government
<PB N="40" REF="028377_0037_0FD8DBA55A458278">
of them. Which to be able to do, mini&s;ters a higher and more la&s;ting plea&s;ure to a man, than to give them their full &s;cope and range. And if o|ther rules of philo&s;ophy be ob&s;erved, &s;uch as the avoiding tho&s;e objects that &s;tir pa&s;&s;ions, nothing rai&s;es higher pa&s;|&s;ions than ungoverned lu&s;t, nothing darkens the under&s;tanding and depre&s;|&s;es a man's mind more, nor is any thing managed with more frequent returns of other immoralities, than &s;uch oaths and imprecations as are on|ly intended to compa&s;s what is de&s;ired. The expence that is nece&s;&s;ary to main|tain the&s;e irregularities, make a man fal&s;e in his other dealings.</P>
<P>All this he freely confe&s;&s;ed was true; upon which I urged that if it was rea|&s;onable for a man to regulate his ap|petite in things which he knew to be hurtful to him, was it not rea&s;onable for God to pre&s;cribe a regulation of the&s;e appetites, who&s;e unre&s;trained cour&s;es did produce &s;uch mi&s;chievious effects? That it could not be denied, but doing to others what we would
<PB N="41" REF="028377_0038_0FD8DBA6D38A7CB8">
have others do unto us, was a ju&s;t rule Tho&s;e men then that knew how extremely &s;en&s;ible they them&s;elves would be of the di&s;honour of their fa|milies in ca&s;e their wives or daughters, mu&s;t needs condemn them&s;elves, for doing that which they could not bear from another. And if the peace of mankind, and the entire &s;atisfaction of our whole life, ought to be one of the chief mea&s;ures of our actions, then let all the world judge, whether a man that confines his appetite, and lives contented at home, is not much hap|pier than tho&s;e that let their de&s;ires run after forbidden objects.</P>
<P>The thing being granted to be bet|ter in it&s;elf, then the que&s;tion falls be|tween the re&s;train of appetite in &s;ome in&s;tances, and the freedom of a man's thoughts, the &s;oundne&s;s of his health, his application to affairs, with the ea|&s;inel&s;s of his whole life. Whether the one is not to be done before the other? As to the difficulty of &s;uch a re&s;traint, though it is not ea&s;y to be done, when a man allows him&s;elf many liberties in
<PB N="42" REF="028377_0039_0FD8DBAA9B8F30E8">
which it is not po&s;&s;ible to &s;top; yet tho&s;e who avoid the occa&s;ions that may kindle the&s;e impure flames, and keep them&s;elves well employed, find the victory and dominion over them no &s;uch impo&s;&s;ible or hard matter as may &s;eem at fir&s;t view.</P>
<P>So that though the philo&s;ophy and morality of this point were plain, yet there is not &s;trength enough in that principle to &s;ubdue nature and appe|tite.</P>
<P>Upon this I urged that morality could not be a &s;trong thing, unle&s;s a man was determined by a law within himfelf: for if he only mea&s;ured him|&s;elf by decency, or the laws of the land, this would teach him only to u&s;e &s;uch caution in his ill practices, that they &s;hould not break out too vi&s;ibly; but would never carry him to an inward and univer&s;al probity. That virtue was of &s;o complicated a nature, that unle&s;s man became entirely within its di&s;cipline, he could not adhere &s;ted|fa&s;tly to any one precept. For vices are often made nece&s;&s;ary &s;upports to
<PB N="43" REF="028377_0040_0FD8DBABDB79C0A0">
one another. That this cannot be done either &s;teadily, or with any &s;a|tisfaction, unle&s;s the mind does in|wardly comply with, and delight in the dictates of virtue. And that could not be effected, except a man's nature was internally regenerated and changed by a higher principle. Till that came about, corrupt nature would be &s;trong, and philo&s;ophy but feeble; e&s;pecially when it &s;truggled with &s;uch appetites or pa&s;&s;ions as were much kindled, or deeply rooted in the con&s;titution of ones body.</P>
<P>This, he &s;aid, &s;ounded to him like enthu&s;ia&s;m or canting. He had no notion of it, and &s;o could not under|&s;tand it. He comprehended the dic|tates of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy, in which as the mind became much con|ver&s;ant, there would &s;oon follow as he believed, a greater ea&s;ine&s;s in obeying its precepts.</P>
<P>I told him on the other hand, that all his &s;peculations of philo&s;ophy would not &s;erve him in any &s;tead, to the re|forming of his nature and life, till he
<PB N="44" REF="028377_0041_0FD8DBB0D419CC38">
applied him&s;elf to God for inward a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. It was certain that the im|pre&s;&s;ions made in his rea&s;on governed him, as they were lively pre&s;ented to him. But the&s;e are &s;o apt to &s;lip out of our memory, and we too apt to turn our thoughts from them, and at &s;ometimes the contrary impre&s;&s;ions are &s;o &s;trong, that let a man &s;et up a rea|&s;oning in his mind again&s;t them, he finds that celebrated &s;aying of the Po|et,

<L>I &s;ee what is better, and approve it: but follow what is wor&s;e,</L></Q>
to be all that philo&s;ophy will amount to. Whereas tho&s;e who upon &s;uch occa&s;ions apply them&s;elves to God, by earne&s;t prayer, feel a di&s;engagement from &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions and them&s;elves endued with a power to re&s;i&s;t them. So that the bonds which formerly held them, fall off.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="028377_0042_0FD8DBB4B9FAAE90">This he &s;aid mu&s;t be the effect of a heat in nature. It was only the &s;trong diver&s;ion of the thoughts that gave the &s;eeming victory, and he did not doubt but if one could turn to a problem in Euclid, or to write a copy of ver&s;es, it would have the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>To this, I an&s;wered, that if &s;uch methods did only divert the thoughts, there might be &s;ome force in what he &s;aid; but if they not only drove out &s;uch inclinations, but begat impre&s;&s;i|ons contrary to them, and brought men into a new di&s;po&s;ition and habit of mind, then he mu&s;t confe&s;s there was &s;omewhat more than a diver&s;ion in the&s;e changes, which were brought on our minds by true devotion. I ad|ded, that rea&s;on and experience were the things that determined our per&s;ua|&s;ions; that as experience without rea|&s;on may be thought the delu&s;ion of our fancy, &s;o rea&s;on without experi|ence had not &s;o convincing an operati|on; But the&s;e two meeting together, mu&s;t needs give a man all the &s;atisfac|tion he can de&s;ire.</P>

true goodne&s;s, and ea&s;ine&s;s and de|light in all the parts of holine&s;s, which was fed and cheri&s;hed in them by a &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in prayer, and did langui&s;h as that went off; had as real a percep|tion of inward &s;trength in their minds, that did ri&s;e and fall with true devoti|on, as they perceived the &s;trength of their bodies increa&s;ed or abated, ac|cording as they had or wanted good nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>After many di&s;cour&s;es upon this &s;ubject, he &s;till continued to think all was the effect of fancy. He &s;aid, that he under&s;tood nothing of it, but ac|knowledged that he thought they were very happy who&s;e fancies were under the power of &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions, &s;ince they had &s;omewhat on which their thoughts re&s;ted and centered. But when I &s;aw him in his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, he then told me, he had another &s;en&s;e of what we had talked concerning prayer and inward a&s;&s;i&s;tances.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject led us to di&s;cour&s;e of God, and of the notion of religion in general. He believed there was a
<PB N="48" REF="028377_0045_0FD8DBBC5DA81A20">
Supreme Being. He could not think the world was made by chance, and the regular cour&s;e of nature &s;eemed to demon&s;trate the eternal power of its Author. This, he &s;aid, he could never &s;hake off; but when he came to explain his notion of the Deity, he &s;aid, he looked upon it as a va&s;t pow|er that wrought every thing by the nece&s;&s;ity of its nature; and thought that God had none of tho&s;e affections of love or hatred, which breed per|turbation in us; and con&s;equently could not &s;ee there was to be either reward or puni&s;hment. He thought our conceptions of God were &s;o low, that we had better not think much of him. And to love God &s;eemed to him a pre&s;umptuous thing, and the heat of fanciful men.</P>
<P>Therefore he believed there &s;hould be no other religious wor&s;hip, but a general celebration of that being in &s;ome &s;hort hymn. All the other parts of wor&s;hip he e&s;teemed the inventions of prie&s;ts, to make the world believe they had a &s;ecret of incen&s;ing and ap|pea&s;ing
<PB N="49" REF="028377_0046_0FD8DBBE24C544E0">
God as they plea&s;ed. In a word, he was neither per&s;uaded that there was a &s;pecial Providence about human affairs, nor that prayers were of much u&s;e, &s;ince that was to look on God as a weak being, that would be overcome with importunities. And for the &s;tate after death, he thought, the &s;oul did not di&s;&s;olve at death, yet he doubted much of rewards or puni&s;h|ments; the one he thought too high for us to attain by our &s;light &s;ervices; and the other was too extreme to be inflicted for &s;in. This was the &s;ub|&s;tance of his &s;peculations about God and religion.</P>
<P>I told him his notion of God was &s;o low that the Supreme Being &s;eemed to be nothing but nature. For if that Being had no freedom or choice of its own actions, nor operated by wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, all tho&s;e rea&s;ons which led him to acknowledge a God, were contrary to this conceit. For if the order of the univer&s;e per&s;uaded him to think there was a God, he mu&s;t at the &s;ame time conceive him to be both wi&s;e
<PB N="50" REF="028377_0047_0FD8DBBECB0843B8">
and good, as well as powerful, &s;ince the&s;e all appeared equally in the crea|tion: though his wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s had ways of exerting them&s;elves, that were far beyond our notions or mea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>If God was wi&s;e and good, he would naturally love and be plea&s;ed with tho&s;e that re&s;embled him in the&s;e perfections, and di&s;like tho&s;e that were oppo&s;ite to him. Every rational being naturally loves it&s;elf, and is delighted in others like it&s;elf, and aver&s;e from what is not &s;o. Truth is a rational nature acting in conformity to it&s;elf in all things, and goodne&s;s is an inclination to pro|mote the happine&s;s of other beings. So truth and goodne&s;s were the e&s;&s;en|tial perfections of every rea&s;onable be|ing; and certainly mo&s;t eminently in the Deity. Nor does his mercy or love rai&s;e pa&s;&s;ion or perturbation in him; for we feel that to be a weakne&s;s in our&s;elves, which indeed only flows from our want of power, or &s;kill to do what we wi&s;h or de&s;ire.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o rea&s;onable to believe God
<PB N="51" REF="028377_0048_0FD8DBC261F06290">
would a&s;&s;i&s;t the endeavour of the good, with &s;ome helps &s;uitable to their na|ture. And it could not be imagined, that tho&s;e who imitated him &s;hould not be e&s;pecially favoured by him; and therefore &s;ince this did not fully ap|pear in this &s;tate, it was mo&s;t rea&s;onable to think it &s;hould be in another, where the rewards &s;hall be an admi&s;&s;ion into a more perfect &s;tate of conformity with God with the felicity that follows it; and the puni&s;hments &s;hould be a total exclu&s;ion from him, with all the hor|ror and darkne&s;s that mu&s;t follow that.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;eemed to be the natural re&s;ults of &s;uch &s;everal cour&s;es of life, as well as the effects of divine ju&s;tice, reward|ing or puni&s;hing. For &s;ince he believ|ed the &s;oul had a di&s;tinct &s;ub&s;tance &s;e|parated from the body, upon its di&s;|&s;olution there was no rea&s;on to think it pa&s;&s;ed into a &s;tate of utter oblivion, of what it had been in formerly. But that as the reflections on the good or evil it had done, mu&s;t rai&s;e joy or hor|ror in it, &s;o tho&s;e good or ill di&s;po&s;iti|ons accompanying the departed &s;ouls,
<PB N="52" REF="028377_0049_0FD8DBC9AF6506B0">
they mu&s;t either ri&s;e up to a higher perfection, or &s;ink to a more depraved and mi&s;erable &s;tate.</P>
<P>In this life, variety of affairs and ob|jects do much cool and divert our minds; and are on the one hand, often great temptations to the good, and give the bad &s;ome ea&s;e in their trouble; but in a &s;tate wherein the &s;oul &s;hall be &s;eparated from &s;en&s;ible things, and em|ployed in a more quick and &s;ublime way of operation, this mu&s;t very much exalt the joys and improvements of the good, and as much heighten the hor|ror and rage of the wicked.</P>
<P>So that it &s;eemed a vain thing to pretend to believe a Supreme Being, that is wi&s;e and good as well as great, and not think a di&s;crimination will be made between the good and the bad, which, it is manife&s;t, is not fully done in this life.</P>
<P>As for the government of the world if we believe the Supreme Power made it, there is no rea&s;on to think he does not govern it. For all that we can fancy again&s;t it is the di&s;traction which that
<PB N="53" REF="028377_0050_0FD8DBCA98F6CEE0">
infinite variety of &s;econd cau&s;es, and the care of their concernments mu&s;t give to the fir&s;t, if it in&s;pects them all. But as among men tho&s;e of weaker ca|pacities are wholly taken up with &s;ome one thing, whereas tho&s;e of more en|larged powers can, without di&s;traction, have many things within their care; as the eye can at one view receive a great variety of objects, in that nar|row compa&s;s, without confu&s;ion: So if we conceive the divine under&s;tanding to be as far above ours, as his power of creating and framing the whole u|niver&s;e is above our limited activity, we will no more think the government of the world a di&s;traction on him. And if we have once overcome this preju|dice, we &s;hall be ready to acknow|ledge a providence directing all affairs; a care well becoming the great crea|tor.</P>
<P>As for wor&s;hipping him, if we ima|gine our wor&s;hip is a thing that adds to his happine&s;s, or gives him &s;uch a fond plea&s;ure as weak people have to hear them&s;elves commended; or that
<PB N="54" REF="028377_0051_0FD8DBCF5681F680">
our repeated addre&s;&s;es do overcome him through our mere importunity, we have certainly very unworthy thoughts of him. The true end of wor&s;hip comes within another con&s;ideration, which is this, a man is never entirely reformed till a new principle governs his thoughts; nothing makes a princi|ple &s;o &s;trong, as deep and frequent meditations of God, who&s;e nature though it be far above our comprehen|&s;ion, yet his goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom are &s;uch perfections as fall within our ima|gination. And he that thinks often of God, and con&s;iders him as governing the world, and as ever ob&s;erving all his actions, will feel a very &s;en&s;ible ef|fect of &s;uch meditations, as they grow more lively and frequent with him; &s;o the end of religious wor&s;hip, either public or private, is to make the appre|hen&s;ions of God have deeper root and a &s;tronger influence on us. The fre|quent returns of the&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary, le&s;t if we allow of too long intervals between them, the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions may grow feebler, and other &s;ugge&s;tions
<PB N="55" REF="028377_0052_0FD8DBD0978CD6D0">
may come in their room. And the returns of prayer are not to be con&s;i|dered as favours extorted by mere im|portunity, but as rewards conferred on men &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed and prepared for them, according to the promi&s;es that God had made for an&s;wering our prayers, thereby to engage and nou|ri&s;h a devout temper in us, which is the chief root of all true holine&s;s and virtue.</P>
<P>It is true, we cannot have &s;uitable notions of the divine e&s;&s;ence; for in|deed we have no ju&s;t Idea of any e&s;|&s;ence what&s;oever. Since we common|ly con&s;ider all things either by their outward figure or effects, and from thence make inferences what their na|ture mu&s;t be; &s;o though we cannot frame any perfect image in our minds of the Divinity, yet we may from the di&s;coveries God has made of him&s;elf, form &s;uch conceptions of him, as may po&s;&s;e&s;s our minds with great reverence for him, and beget in us &s;uch a love of tho&s;e perfections as to engage us to imi|tate them. For when we &s;ay we love,
<PB N="56" REF="028377_0053_0FD8DBD59ECF5058">
the meaning is, we love that being God that is holy, ju&s;t, good, wi&s;e, and in|finitely perfect. And loving the&s;e at|tributes in that object, will certainly carry us to de&s;ire them in our&s;elves. For whatever we love in another, we naturally, according to the degree of our love, endeavour to re&s;emble. In &s;um, the loving and wor&s;hipping of God, though they are ju&s;t and rea&s;on|able returns and expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;en&s;e we have of his goodne&s;s to us, yet they are exacted of us not only as a tribute to God, but as a mean to beget in us a conformity to his nature, which is the chief end of pure and undefiled reli|gion.</P>
<P>If &s;ome men have at &s;everal times found out inventions to corrupt this, and cheat the world, it is nothing but what occurs in every form of employ|ment to which men betake them&s;elves. Mountebanks corrupt phy&s;ic: petty-|foggers have entangled the matters of property: and all profe&s;&s;ions have been vitiated by the knaveries of a number of their calling.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="028377_0054_0FD8DBD8D86642F8">With all the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es he was not equally &s;atisfied. He &s;eemed convin|ced that the impre&s;&s;ions of God being much in men's minds, would be a pow|erful means to reform the world; and did not &s;eem determined again&s;t Pro|vidence. But for the next &s;tate he thought it more likely that the Soul be|gan anew, and that her &s;en&s;e of what &s;he had done in this body, lying in the figures that are made in the brain as &s;oon as &s;he di&s;lodged, all the&s;e peri&s;h|ed, and that the &s;oul went into &s;ome other &s;tate to begin a new cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But I &s;aid upon this head, that this was at be&s;t a conjecture rai&s;ed in him by his fancy, for he could give no rea&s;on to prove it true. Nor was all the re|membrance our &s;ouls had of pa&s;t things, &s;eated in &s;ome material figures lodged in the brain: though it could not be denied but that a great deal of it lay in the brain. That we have many ab|&s;tracted notions and ideas of immate|rial things, which depend not on bo|dily Figures. Some &s;ins, &s;uch as fal&s;|hood and ill nature were &s;eated in the

mind, as lu&s;t and appetite were in the body; and as the whole body was the receptacle of the &s;oul, and the eyes and ears were the organs of &s;eeing and hearing, &s;o was the brain the &s;eat of memory. Yet the power and faculty of memory, as well as of &s;eeing and hearing, lay in the mind; and &s;o it was no inconceivable thing that either the &s;oul by its own &s;trength, or by the means of &s;ome &s;ubtiler organs, which might be fitted for it in another &s;tate, &s;hould &s;till remember as well as think.</P>
<P>But indeed we know &s;o little of the nature of our &s;ouls, that it is a vain thing for us to rai&s;e an hypothe&s;is out of the conjectures we have about it, or to reject one, because of &s;ome difficul|ties that occur to us; &s;ince it is as hard to under&s;tand how we remember things now, as how we &s;hall do it in another &s;tate; only we are &s;ure we do it now, and &s;o we &s;hall be then when we do it.</P>
<P>When I pre&s;&s;ed him with the &s;ecret joys a good manfelt, particularly as he drew near death, and the horrors of ill men
<PB N="59" REF="028377_0056_0FD8DBDC16C456B0">
e&s;pecially at that time; he was willing to a&s;cribe to the impre&s;&s;ions they had recei|ved from their education. But he often confe&s;&s;ed that whether the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion was true or not, he thought tho&s;e who had the per&s;ua&s;ions of it, and lived &s;o that they had quiet in their con&s;ciences, and believed God govern|ed the world, and acquie&s;ced in his pro|vidence, and had the hope of an endle&s;s ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in another &s;tate, the hap|pie&s;t men in the world. And &s;aid, he would give all he was ma&s;ter of to be under tho&s;e per&s;ua&s;ions, and to have the &s;upports and joys that mu&s;t needs flow from them.</P>
<P>I told him the main root of all cor|ruptions in men's principles, was their ill life; which, as it darkened their minds, and di&s;abled them from di&s;|cerning better things; &s;o it made it nece&s;&s;ary for them to &s;eek out &s;uch opi|nions as might give them ea&s;e from tho&s;e clamours, that would otherwi&s;e have been rai&s;ed in them. He did not deny but that after the doing of &s;ome things, he felt great and &s;evere chal|lenges
<PB N="60" REF="028377_0057_0FD8DBE20734BA00">
within him&s;elf: But he &s;aid, he felt not the&s;e after &s;ome others which I would perhaps call far greater &s;ins, than tho&s;e that affected him more &s;en|&s;ibly. This I &s;aid, might flow from the di&s;orders he had ca&s;t him&s;elf into, which had corrupted his judgment and vitiated his ta&s;te of things; and by his long continuance in, and frequent re|peating of &s;ome immoralities, he had made them &s;o familiar to him that they had become as it were natural: And then it was no wonder if he had not &s;o exact a &s;en&s;e of what was good or e|vil; as a fevri&s;h man cannot judge of ta&s;tes.</P>
<P>He did acknowledge the whole &s;y&s;tem of religion, if believed, was a greater foundation of quiet than any other thing what&s;oever; for all the quiet he had in his mind, was, that he could not think &s;o good a being as the Deity would make him mi&s;erable. I a&s;ked him if when by the ill cour&s;e of his life he had brought &s;o many di&s;ea&s;es on his body, he could blame God for it; or expect that he &s;hould deliver him from
<PB N="61" REF="028377_0058_0FD8DBE357702AF8">
them by a miracle. He confe&s;&s;ed there was no rea&s;on for that. I then urged that if &s;in &s;hould ca&s;t the mind by a natural effect, into endle&s;s horrors and agonies, which being &s;eated in a being not &s;ubject to death, it mu&s;t la&s;t for ever unle&s;s &s;ome miraculous power in|terpo&s;ed, could he accu&s;e God for that which was the effect of his own choice and ill life.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, they were happy that be|lieved, for it was not in every man's power.</P>
<P>And upon this we di&s;cour&s;ed long about revealed religion. He &s;aid, he did not under&s;tand the bu&s;ine&s;s of in|&s;piration; he believed the writers of the Scriptures had heats and hone&s;ty, and &s;o writ; but could not compre|hend how God &s;hould reveal his &s;ecrets to mankind. Why was not man made a creature more di&s;po&s;ed for religion, and better illuminated? He could not apprehend how there &s;hould be any corruption in the nature of man, or a lap&s;e derived from Adam. God's communicating his mind to one man,
<PB N="62" REF="028377_0059_0FD8DBE76ECB2810">
was the putting it in his power to cheat the world. For propne&s;ies and mi|racles, the world had always been full of &s;trange &s;tories; for the boldne&s;s and cunning of the contrivers meeting with the &s;implicity and credulity of the people, things were ea&s;ily received; and being once received, pa&s;&s;ed down without contradiction. The incohe|rences of &s;tyle in the Scriptures, the odd tran&s;itions, the &s;eeming contra|dictions, chiefly about the order of time, the cruelties enjoyned the <HI>I&s;ra|elites</HI> in de&s;troying the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> cir|cum&s;icion, and many other rites of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> wor&s;hip, &s;eemed to him un&s;uitable to the divine nature; and the fir&s;t three chapters of Gene&s;is, he thought could not be true, unle&s;s they were parables. This was the &s;ub|&s;tance of what he excepted to reveal|ed religion in general, and to the old Te&s;tament in particular.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered to all this, that believ|ing a thing upon the te&s;timony of ano|ther, in other matters where there was no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the te&s;timony,
<PB N="63" REF="028377_0060_0FD8DBEA687C6910">
chiefly where it was confirmed by o|ther circum&s;tances, was not only a rea&s;onable thing, but was the hinge on which all the government and ju&s;|tice in the world depended; &s;ince all courts of ju&s;tice proceed from evidence given by witne&s;&s;es, for the u&s;e of wri|tings is but a thing more lately brought into the world.</P>
<P>So then if the credibility of the thing, the innocence and di&s;intere&s;ted|ne&s;s of the witne&s;&s;es, the number of them, and the mo&s;t public confirmati|ons that could po&s;&s;ibly be given, do concur to per&s;uade us of any matter of fact, and it is a vain thing to &s;ay, becau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible for &s;o many men to agree in a lie, that therefore the&s;e have done it. In all other things a man gives his a&s;&s;ent when the credibi|lity is &s;trong on the one &s;ide, and there appears nothing on the other &s;ide to balance it.</P>
<P>So &s;uch numbers agreeing in the te&s;timony of the&s;e miracles, for in|&s;tance&mdash;our Saviour's calling <HI>Lazarus</HI> out of the grave the fourth day after
<PB N="64" REF="028377_0061_0FD8DBED1879F9D8">
he was buried, and his own ri&s;ing a|gain after he was certainly dead; if there had been ever &s;o many impo&s;|tures in the world, no man can with rea&s;onable colour pretend this was one.</P>
<P>We find both by the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Ro|man</HI> writers that lived in that time, that our Saviour was crucified: and that all his di&s;ciples and followers be|lieved certainly that he ro&s;e again. They believed this upon the te&s;timony of the Apo&s;tles, and of many hun|dreds who &s;aw it, and died confirm|ing it. They went about to per&s;uade the world of it, with great zeal, though they knew they were to get nothing by it, but reproach and &s;uffer|ings: and by many wonders which they wrought they confirmed their te&s;timo|ny. Now to avoid all this by &s;aying, it is po&s;&s;ible this might be a contrivance and to give no pre&s;umption to make it &s;o much as probable, that it was &s;o, is in plain Engli&s;h to &s;ay, <HI>We are re|&s;olved, let the evidence be what it will, we will not believe it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="028377_0062_0FD8DBF10AE6D138">He &s;aid, if a man &s;ays he cannot be|lieve, what help is there? for he was not ma&s;ter of his own belief, and be|lieving was at highe&s;t but a probable opinion.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wered, that if a man will let a wanton conceit po&s;&s;e&s;s his fancy again&s;t the&s;e things and never con&s;ider the evidence for religion on the other hand, but reject it upon a flight view of it, he ought not to &s;ay he cannot, but will not believe. And while a man lives an ill cour&s;e of life, he is not fitly qualified to examine the matter aright. Let him grow calm and virtuous, andup on due applicati|on examine things fairly, and then let him pronounce according to his con|&s;cience, if to take it at its lowe&s;t, the rea&s;ons on the one hand are not much &s;tronger than they are on the other. For I found he was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the general conceit, that a mixture of knaves and fools had made all extra|ordinary things ea&s;ily believed, that it carried him away to determine the matter, without &s;o much as looking
<PB N="66" REF="028377_0063_0FD8DBF25B6EC420">
on the hi&s;torical evidence for the truth of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> which he had not en|quired into, but had bent all upon his wit and &s;tudy to the &s;upport of the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>As for that, that believing is at be&s;t but an opinion; if the evidence be but probable, it is &s;o; but if it be &s;uch that it cannot be que&s;tioned, it grows as certain as knowledge. For we are no le&s;s certain that there is a great town called <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the &s;eat of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> empire, than that there is another called <HI>London.</HI> We have as little doubt that queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> once reigned, as that king <HI>Charles</HI> now reigns in <HI>England.</HI> So that believing may be as certain, and as little &s;ubject to doubting as &s;eeing or knowing.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of believing divine matters; the one is wrought in us by our comparing all the eviden|ces of matter of fact, for the confirma|tion of revealed religion, with the prophe&s;ies in the Scripture; where things were punctually predicted, &s;ome ages before their completion; not in
<PB N="67" REF="028377_0064_0FD8DBF41932BAB8">
dark and doubtful words, uttered like oracles, that could bend to any event; but in plain terms, as the foretelling that <HI>Cyrus</HI> by name &s;hould &s;end the <HI>Jews</HI> back from the captivity, after the fixed period of &s;eventy years: The hi&s;tory of the Syrian and Egyptian kings &s;o punctually foretold by <HI>Daniel;</HI> and the prediction of the de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> with many circum&s;tan|ces relating to it, made by our Savi|our; joining the&s;e to the excellent rule and de&s;ign of the Scripture in mat|ters of morality, it is at lea&s;t as rea|&s;onable to believe this as any thing el&s;e in the world. Yet &s;uch a believing as this, is only a general per&s;ua&s;ion in the mind, which has not that effect, till a man applying him&s;elf to the di|rections &s;et down in the Scriptures, which upon &s;uch evidence cannot be denied, to be as rea&s;onable, as for a man to follow the pre&s;criptions of a learned phy&s;ician, and when the&s;e rules are both good and ea&s;y, to &s;ubmit to them for the recovering of his health, and by following the&s;e, finds a

power entering within him, that frees him from the &s;lavery of his appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, that exalts his mind above the accidents of life, and &s;preads an inward purity in his heart, from which a &s;erene and calm joy ari&s;es within him. And good men by the efficacy the&s;e methods have upon them, and from the returns of their prayers and other endeavours, grow a&s;&s;ured that the&s;e things are true, and an&s;werable to the promi&s;es they find regi&s;tered in Scripture.</P>
<P>All this, he &s;aid, might be fancy. But to this I an&s;wered, that as it were unrea&s;onable to tell a man that is a|broad, and knows he is awake, that perhaps he is in a dream, and in his bed, and only thinks he is abroad, or that as &s;ome go about in their &s;leep, &s;o he may be a&s;leep &s;till; &s;o good and religious men know, though others may be abu&s;ed by their fancies, that they are under no &s;uch deception; and find they are neither hot nor en|thu&s;ia&s;tical, but under the power of calm and pure principles. All this he

&s;aid he did not under&s;tand, and that it was to a&s;&s;ert or beg the thing in que&s;tion which he could not compre|hend.</P>
<P>As for the po&s;&s;ibility of revelation, it was a vain thing to deny it: For as God gives us the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing mate|rial objects by our eyes, and opened in &s;ome a capacity of apprehending high and &s;ublime things, of which o|ther men &s;eemed utterly incapable; &s;o that it was a weak a&s;&s;ertion, that God cannot awaken a power in &s;ome men's minds, to apprehend and know &s;ome things in &s;uch a manner that others are not capable of it. This is not half &s;o incredible to us as &s;ight is to a blind man, who yet may be convinced there is a &s;trange power of &s;eeing, that governs men, of which he finds him|&s;elf deprived.</P>
<P>As for the capacity put into &s;uch men's hands to deceive the world, we are at the &s;ame time to con&s;ider that be&s;ides the probity of their tempers, it cannot be thought but God can &s;o forcibly bind up a man in &s;ome things

that it &s;hould not be in his power to deliver them otherwi&s;e than as he gives him in commi&s;&s;ion. Be&s;ides the confirmation of miracles are a divine credential, to warrant &s;uch per&s;ons in what they deliver to the world; which cannot be imagined can be joined to a lie, &s;ince this were to put the omni|potence of God, to atte&s;t that which no hone&s;t man will do.</P>
<P>For the bu&s;ine&s;s of the fall of man, and other things of which we cannot perhaps give our&s;elves a perfect ac|count, we who cannot fathom the &s;e|crets of the council of God, do very unrea&s;onably to take on us to reject an excellent &s;y&s;tem of good and holy rules, becau&s;e we cannot &s;atisfy our|&s;elves about &s;ome difficulties in them. Common experience tells us there is a great di&s;order in our natures, which is not ea&s;ily rectified. All philo&s;ophers were &s;en&s;ible of it, and every man that de&s;igns to govern him&s;elf by rea|&s;on, feels the &s;truggle between it and nature. So that it is plain, there is a lap&s;e of the high powers of the Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="028377_0068_0FD8DBFFE6DBA990">But why, &s;aid he, could not this be rectified by &s;ome plain rules given; but men mu&s;t come and &s;hew a trick to per&s;uade the world they &s;peak to them in the name of God? I an&s;wer|ed that religion being a de&s;ign to re|cover and &s;ave mankind, was to be &s;o opened as to awaken and work upon all &s;orts of people: and generally men of a &s;implicity of mind, were tho&s;e that were the fitte&s;t objects for God to &s;hew his favour to. Therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary that me&s;&s;engers &s;ent from heaven, &s;hould appear with &s;uch a|larming evidences, as might awaken the world, and prepare them by &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hing &s;igns, to li&s;ten to the doc|trine they were to deliver.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy, that was only a matter of fine &s;peculation, had few votaries. And as there was no authority in it to bind the world to believe its dictates, &s;o they were only received by &s;ome of nobler and re&s;ined natures, who could apply them&s;elves to and delight in &s;uch notions. But true religion was to be built upon a foundation, that
<PB N="72" REF="028377_0069_0FD8DC016731D428">
&s;hould carry more weight on it, and to have &s;uch convictions as might not only reach tho&s;e who were already di&s;po&s;ed to receive them, but rou&s;e up &s;uch as without great and &s;en&s;ible ex|citation would have otherwi&s;e &s;lept on in their ill cour&s;es.</P>
<P>Upon this and &s;ome other occa&s;ions, I told him I &s;aw the ill u&s;e he made of his wit, by which he flurred the grav|e&s;t things with a &s;light da&s;h of his fan|cy; and the plea&s;ure he found in &s;uch wanton expre&s;&s;ions, as calling the do|ing of miracles, <HI>The &s;hewing of a trick,</HI> did really keep him from examining them, with that care which &s;uch things required.</P>
<P>For the old Te&s;tament, we are &s;o remote from that time, we have &s;o little knowledge of the Language in which it was writ, have &s;o imperfect an account of the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e ages, know nothing of their cu&s;toms, forms of &s;peech, and the &s;everal periods they might have by which they reckoned their time, that it is rather a wonder we &s;hould under&s;tand &s;o much of it,
<PB N="73" REF="028377_0070_0FD8DC0734A90C70">
than that many pa&s;&s;ages in it &s;hould be &s;od ark to us. The chief u&s;e it has to us Chri&s;tians is, that from writings which the <HI>Jews</HI> acknowledge to be divinely in&s;pired, it is manife&s;t the <HI>Me&s;&s;ia</HI> was promi&s;ed before the de&s;truction of their temple; which being done long ago, and the&s;e prophe&s;ies agreeing to our Saviour, and no other; here is a great confirmation given to the Go&s;pel. But though many things in the&s;e books could not be under&s;tood by us, who lived above three thou&s;and years af|ter the chief of them were written, it is no &s;uch extraordinary matter.</P>
<P>For that of the de&s;truction of the <HI>Ca|naanites</HI> by the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> it is to be con&s;idered that if God had &s;ent a plague among them all, that could not have been found fault with. If then God had a right to take away their lives, without inju&s;tice or cruel|ty, he had a right to appoint others to do it, as well to execute it by a more immediate way. And the taking away people by the &s;word is a much gentler way of dying, than to be &s;mitten with
<PB N="74" REF="028377_0071_0FD8DC0A31558828">
a plague or a famine. And for the children that were innocent of their father's faults, God could in another &s;tate make that up to them. So all the difficulty is, why were the <HI>I&s;rael|ites</HI> commanded to execute a thing of &s;uch barbarity? But this will not &s;eem &s;o hard, if we con&s;ider that this was to be no precedent for future times; &s;ince they did not do it but upon &s;peci|al warrant and command from hea|ven, evidenced to all the world by &s;uch mighty miracles as did plainly &s;hew that they were particularly de&s;ign'd by God for the executioners of his ju&s;|tice. And God by employing them in &s;o &s;evere a &s;ervice, intended to po&s;|&s;e&s;s them with great horror of Idola|try, which was puni&s;hed in &s;o extreme a manner.</P>
<P>For the rites of their religion, we can ill judge of them, except we per|fectly under&s;tood the idolatries round about them; to which we find they were much inclined. So they were to be bent by other rites to an extreme aver&s;ion from them; and yet by the
<PB N="75" REF="028377_0072_0FD8DC0C9C7771F0">
pomp of many of their ceremonies and &s;acrifices, great indulgencies were given to a people naturally fond of a vi&s;ible &s;plendor in religious wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>In all which, if we cannot de&s;cend to &s;uch &s;atisfactory an&s;wers, in every particular as a curious man could de|&s;ire, it is no wonder. The long inter|val of time, and other accidents, have worn out tho&s;e things which were ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give us a clear light into the meaning of them. And for the &s;tory of the creation, how far &s;ome things in it may be parabolical, and how far hi&s;torical, has been much di&s;puted; there is nothing in it that may not be hi&s;torically true. For if it be acknow|ledged that &s;pirits can form voices in the air, for which we have as good authority as for any thing in hi&s;tory, then it is no wonder that <HI>Eve</HI> being &s;o lately created, might be deceived and think a &s;erpent &s;pake to her, when the evil &s;pirit framed the voice.</P>

Nothing can conduce more to the peace, order, and happine&s;s of the world, than to be governed by its rules. Nothing is more for the inte|re&s;ts of every man in particular. The rules of &s;obriety, temperance and mo|deration, were the be&s;t pre&s;ervers of life, and which was perhaps more, of health. Humility, contempt of the vanities of the world, and being well employed, rai&s;es a man's mind to a freedom from the follies and temptati|ons that haunted the greater part. Nothing was &s;o generous and great, as to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of the poor, and to forgive injuries. Nothing rai|&s;ed and maintained a man's reputation &s;o much, as to be exactly ju&s;t and mer|ciful, kind, charitable, and compa&s;&s;i|onate; nothing opened the powers of a man's &s;oul &s;o much as a calm tem|per; a &s;erene mind free of pa&s;&s;ion and di&s;order.

<P>The <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> wor&s;hip was al&s;o plain and &s;imple; &s;uitable to &s;o pure a doc|trine.

<P>I de&s;ired he would lay all the&s;e things together, and &s;ee what he could except to them, to make him think this was a contrivance. Intere&s;t: ap|pears in all human contrivancies. Our Saviour plainly had none; he avoided applau&s;e, withdrew him&s;elf from the offers of a crown; he &s;ubmitted to po|verty and reproach, much contradicti|on in his life, and to a mo&s;t ignomi|nous and painful death.</P>
<P>His apo&s;tles had none neither; they did not pretend either to power or wealth, but delivered a doctrine that

And they gave &s;uch public confirmations of it, by the wonders they them&s;elves wrought, that great multitudes were converted to a doctrine, which, be|&s;ides the oppo&s;ition it gave to lu&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion, was borne down and per&s;ecu|ted for three hundred years; and yet its force was &s;uch, that it not only weathered out all tho&s;e &s;torms, but even grew and &s;pread va&s;tly under them.</P>

<P>If a man will lay all this in one ba|lance, and compare with it the few exceptions brought to it, he will &s;oon find how &s;trong the one, and how &s;light the other are.

<P>The believing my&s;teries, he &s;aid, made way for all the jugglings of Prie&s;ts, for they getting the people under them in that point, &s;et out to them what they plea&s;ed; and giving it a hard name, and calling it a <HI>My&s;te|ry,</HI> the people were tamed, and ea&s;i|ly believed it.</P>

<P>For my&s;teries, it is plain there is in every thing &s;omewhat unaccountable. How animals or men are formed in their mother's bellies, how &s;eeds grow in the earth, how the &s;oul dwells in the body, and acts and moves it; how we retain the figures of &s;o many words or things in our memories, and how we draw them out &s;o ea&s;ily and order|ly in our thoughts or di&s;cour&s;es? How &s;ight and hearing were &s;o quick and di&s;tinct, how we move, and how bo|dies were compounded and united?</P>
<P>The&s;e things if we follow them into all the difficulties, that we may rai&s;e about them, will appear every whit as unaccountable as any my&s;tery of religion. And a blind or deaf man would judge &s;ight or hearing as incre|dible, as any my&s;tery may be judged by us: for our rea&s;on is not equal to them. In the &s;ame rank, different

degrees of age or capacity rai&s;e &s;ome far above others: &s;o that children can|not fathom the learning nor weak per&s;ons the coun&s;els of more illumi|nated minds. Therefore it was no wonder if we could not under&s;tand the divine e&s;&s;ence. We cannot ima|gine how two &s;uch different natures as &s;oul and body &s;hould &s;o unite together, and be mutually affected with one an|other's concerns; and how the &s;oul has one principle of rea&s;on, by which it acts intellectually, and another of life by which it joins to the body and acts vitally; two principles &s;o widely differing both in their nature and ope|ration, and yet united in one and the &s;ame per&s;on. There might be as ma|ny hard arguments brought again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of the&s;e things, which yet every one knows to be true, from &s;pe|culative notions, as again&s;t the my&s;te|ries mentioned in the Scriptures.</P>
<P>As that of the Trinity, that in one e&s;&s;ence there are three different prin|ciples of operation, which, for want of terms fit to expre&s;s them by, are
<PB N="84" REF="028377_0081_0FD8BE5BF48ED198">
called per&s;ons, and are called in Scrip|ture, the <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and that the &s;econd of the&s;e did unite him&s;elf in a mo&s;t intimate manner with the humane nature of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: and that the &s;ufferings he underwent were accepted of God as a &s;acrifice for our &s;ins: who thereupon confer|red on him a power of granting eter|nal life to all that &s;ubmit to the terms on which he offers it: and that the matter of which our bodies once con|&s;i&s;ted, which may be as ju&s;tly called the bodies we laid down at our deaths, as the&s;e can be &s;aid to be the bodies we formerly lived in, being refined and made more &s;piritual, &s;hall be reu|nited to our &s;ouls and become a fit in&s;trument for them in a more per|fect e&s;tate: and that God inwardly bends and moves our wills, by &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions as he can make on our bo|dies and minds.</P>
<P>The&s;e, which are the chief my&s;te|ries of our religion, are neither &s;o unrea&s;onable, that any other objection lies again&s;t them, but this, that they
<PB N="85" REF="028377_0082_0FD8DC2B9F9AC260">
agree not with our common notions, nor &s;o unaccountable that &s;omewhat like them, cannot be a&s;&s;igned in other things, which are believed really to be, though the manner of them can|not be apprehended.</P>
<P>So this ought not to be any ju&s;t ob|jection to the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of our rea&s;on to what we cannot &s;o well conceive, provided our belief of it be well grounded. There have been too many niceties brought indeed, rather to darken than explain the&s;e: they have been defended by weak argu|ments, and illu&s;trated by &s;imilies not always &s;o very apt and pertinent. And new &s;ubtilties have been added which have rather perplexed than cleared them. All this cannot be denied; the oppo&s;ition of hereticks anciently occa&s;ioned too much curio&s;ity among the fathers: which the &s;chool-men have wonderfully advanced of late times.</P>
<P>But if my&s;teries were received rather in the &s;implicity in which they are delivered in the Scriptures, than
<PB N="86" REF="028377_0083_0FD8DC31237F72B8">
according to the di&s;cantings of fanci|ful men upon them, they would not appear much more incredible, than &s;ome of the common objects of &s;en&s;e and perception. And it is a needle&s;s fear that if &s;ome my&s;teries are acknow|ledged, that are plainly mentioned in the new Te&s;tament, it will then be in the power of the prie&s;ts to add more at their plea&s;ure. For it is an ab&s;urd inference from our being bound to a&s;&s;ent to &s;ome truths about the divine e&s;&s;ence, of which the manner is not under&s;tood, to argue that therefore in an object pre&s;ented duly to our &s;en&s;es, &s;uch as bread and wine, we &s;hould be bound to believe again&s;t their te&s;timo|ny, that it is not what our &s;en&s;es per|ceived it to be, but the whole fle&s;h and blood of Chri&s;t; an entire body being in every crumb and drop of it. It is not indeed in a man's power to believe thus again&s;t his &s;en&s;e and rea|&s;on, where the object is proportioned to them, and fitly applied, and the organs are under no indi&s;po&s;ition or di&s;order.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="028377_0084_0FD8DC32DADF3238">It is certain that no my&s;tery is to be admitted, but upon very clear and expre&s;s authorities from Scripture, which could not rea&s;onably be under|&s;tood in any other &s;en&s;e. And though a man can form no explicit notion of a my&s;tery, for then it would be no lon|ger a my&s;tery; yet in general he may believe a thing to be, though he can|not give him&s;elf a particular account of the way of it; or rather, though he cannot an&s;wer &s;ome objections that lie again&s;t it. We know we believe ma|ny &s;uch in human matters, which are more within our reach; and it is very unrea&s;onable to &s;ay we may not do it in divine things, which are much more above our apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>For the &s;evere re&s;traint of the u&s;e of women, it is hard to deny that pri|vilege to Je&s;us Chri&s;t as a law-giver, to lay &s;uch re&s;traints as all in&s;erior le|gi&s;lators do; who when they find the liberties their &s;ubjects take, prove hurtful to them, &s;et &s;uch limits, and make &s;uch regulations as they judge nece&s;&s;ary and expedient.

be &s;aid but the re&s;traint of appetites is nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome in&s;tances; and if it is nece&s;&s;ary in the&s;e, perhaps other re|&s;traints are no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to fortify and &s;ecure them. For if it be acknow|ledged that men have a property in their wives and daughters, &s;o that to defile the one, or corrupt the other, is an unju&s;t and injurious thing; it is certain, that except a man carefully governs his appetites, he will break through the&s;e re&s;traints: and There|fore our Saviour knowing that nothing could &s;o effectually deliver the world from mi&s;chief and unre&s;trained appe|tite, as &s;uch a con&s;inement, might ve|ry rea&s;onably enjoin it. And in all &s;uch ca&s;es we are to balance the inconveni|encies on both hands, and where we find they are heavie&s;t, we are to acknowledge the equity of the law. On the one hand there is no prejudice but the re&s;traint of appetite; on the other are the mi&s;chiefs of being given up to plea&s;ure, of running inordinately into it, of breaking the quiet of our own family at home, and of others

But in a &s;tate of polygamy they are under great mi&s;ery and jealou&s;y, and are indeed barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed. Man being al&s;o of a &s;ociable nature, friend&s;hip and conver&s;e were among the primi|tive intendments of marriage, in which as far as man may excel the wife in greatne&s;s of mind, and height of know|ledge, the wife &s;ome way makes that up with, her affection and tender care: &s;o that from both happily mixed, there ari&s;es a harmony, which is to virtu|ous minds one of the greate&s;t joys of life. But all this is gone in a &s;tate of
<PB N="90" REF="028377_0087_0FD8DC399C55E418">
polygamy, which occa&s;ions perpetual jarrings and jealou&s;ies. And the va|riety does but engage men to a freer range of plea&s;ure, which is not to be put in the balance with the far greater mi&s;chiefs that mu&s;t follow the other cour&s;e.</P>
<P>So that it is plain, our Saviour con|&s;idered the nature of man, what it could bear, and what was fit for it, when he &s;o re&s;trained us in the&s;e our liberties.</P>
<P>And for divorce, a power to break that bond would too much encourage married per&s;ons in the little quarrel|lings that may ri&s;e between them, if it were in their power to depart one from another. For when they know that cannot be, and that they mu&s;t live and die together, it does naturally incline them to lay down their re&s;ent|ments, and to endeavour to live as well together as they can.</P>
<P>So the law of the go&s;pel being a law of love, de&s;igned to engage <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to mutual love; it was fit that all &s;uch provi&s;ions &s;hould be made, as might
<PB N="91" REF="028377_0088_0FD8DC3B1AA8CC70">
advance and maintain it: and all &s;uch liberties be taken away, as are apt to enkindle and foment &s;trife. This might fall in&s;tances to be unea&s;y and hard, enough, but laws con&s;ider what falls out mo&s;t commonly, and cannot provide for all particular ca&s;es. The be&s;t laws are in &s;ome in&s;tances very great grievances. But the advanta|ges being balanced with the inconve|niences, mea&s;ures are to be taken ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>Upon this whole matter I &s;aid, that plea&s;ure &s;tood in oppo&s;ition to other con&s;iderations of great weight, and &s;o the deci&s;ion was ea&s;y. And &s;ince our Saviour offers us &s;o great rewards, it is but rea&s;onable he has a privilege of loading the&s;e promi&s;es with &s;uch con|ditions, as are not in them&s;elves grate|ful to our natural inclinations: for all that propo&s;e high rewards, have there|by a right to exact difficult perform|ances.</P>
<P>To this he &s;aid, we are &s;ure the terms are difficult, but are not &s;o &s;ure of the rewards. Upon this I told
<PB N="92" REF="028377_0089_0FD8DC3EB6FD4928">
him, that we have the &s;ame a&s;&s;urance of the rewards, that we have of the other parts of <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI> We have the promi&s;es of God made to us by Chri&s;t, confirmed by many mira|cles. We have the earne&s;ts of the&s;e, in the quiet and peace which follows a good con&s;cience; and in the re&s;urrec|tion of him from the dead, who hath promi&s;ed to rai&s;e us up. So that the reward is &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured to us: and there is no rea&s;on it &s;hould be given to us, before the conditions are perform|ed, on which the promi&s;es are made. It is but rea&s;onable we &s;hould tru&s;t God, and do our duty, <HI>in hopes of that eternal life, which God who cannot lye, hath promi&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>The difficulties are not &s;o great, as tho&s;e which &s;ometimes the commone&s;t concerns of life bring upon us. The learning &s;ome trades or &s;ciences, the governing our health or affairs, bring us often under as great &s;traights. So that it ought to be no ju&s;t prejudice, that there are &s;ome things in Religion that are unea&s;y, &s;ince this is rather the
<PB N="93" REF="028377_0090_0FD8DC41D9683A08">
effect of our corrupt natures, which are farther depraved by vicious habits, and can hardly turn to any new cour&s;e of life, without &s;ome pain, than of the dictates of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> which are in them&s;elves ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, and will be ea&s;y to us when renewed, and in a good mea&s;ure re&s;tored to our pri|mitive integrity.</P>
<P>As for the exceptions he had to the maintenance of the clergy, and the authority to which they pretended; if they &s;tretched their de&s;igns too far, the Go&s;pel did plainly reprove them for it. So that it was very &s;uitable to that church, which was &s;o gro&s;sly faul|ty this way, to take the Scriptures out of the hands of the people, &s;ince they do &s;o manife&s;tly di&s;claim all &s;uch practices. The prie&s;ts of the true <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> have no &s;ecrets a|mong them, which the world mu&s;t not know, but are only an order of Men dedicated to God, to attend on &s;acred things, who ought to be holy in a more peculiar manner, &s;ince they are to handle the things of God. It
<PB N="94" REF="028377_0091_0FD8DC46E762E2C0">
was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould have a due e&s;teem paid them, and a fit maintainance appointed for them, that &s;o they might be pre&s;erved from the contempt that follows poverty, and the di&s;tractions which the provi|ding again&s;t it might other ways involve them in. And as in the order of the world, it was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;up|port of magi&s;tracy and government, and for pre&s;erving its e&s;teem, that &s;ome &s;tate be u&s;ed (though it is a hap|pine&s;s when great men have philo&s;o|phical minds, to de&s;pi&s;e the pageant|ry of it.) So the plentiful &s;upply of the clergy, if well u&s;ed and applied by them, will certainly turn to the advantage of religion. And if &s;ome men either through ambition or covet|ou&s;ne&s;s u&s;ed indirect means, or &s;er|vile compliances to a&s;pire to &s;uch dig|nities, and being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them, applied their wealth either to luxury or vain pomp, or made great fortunes out of it for their families; the&s;e were per&s;onal failings in which the doctrine of Chri&s;t was not concerned.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="028377_0092_0FD8DC47DA4BA8B0">He upon that told me plainly, there was nothing that gave him, and ma|ny others, a more &s;ecret encourage|ment in their ill ways, than that tho&s;e who pretended to believe, lived &s;o that they could not be thought to be in earne&s;t, when they &s;aid it. For he was &s;ure religion was either a mere contrivance, or the mo&s;t important thing that could be. So that if he once believed, he would &s;et him&s;elf in great earne&s;t to live &s;uitably to it. The a&s;pirings that he had ob&s;erved at court, of &s;ome of the clergy, with the &s;ervile ways they took to attain to preferment, and the animo&s;ities among tho&s;e of &s;everal parties, about trifles, made him often think they &s;u&s;pected the things were not true which in their &s;ermons and di&s;cour&s;es they &s;o earne&s;t|ly recommended.</P>
<P>Of this he had gathered many in|&s;tances; I knew &s;ome of them were mi&s;takes and calumnies; yet I could not deny but &s;omething of them might be too true. And I publi&s;h this the more freely, to put all that pretend

to religion, chiefly to tho&s;e that are dedicated to holy functions, in mind of the great obligation that lies on them to live &s;uitably to their profe&s;&s;i|on. Since otherwi&s;e a great deal of the irreligion and athei&s;m that is a|mong us, may too ju&s;tly be charged on them: for wicked men are delight|ed out of mea&s;ure when they di&s;cover ill things in them, and conclude from thence not only that they are hypo|crites, but that religion it&s;elf is a cheat.</P>
<P>But I &s;aid to him on this head, that though no good man could continue in the practice of any known &s;in, yet &s;uch might by the violence or &s;urpri&s;e of a temptation, to which they are li|able as much as others, be of a &s;udden overcome to do an ill thing, to their great grief all their life after. And then it was a very unju&s;t inference, upon &s;ome few failings, to conclude that &s;uch men do not believe them|&s;elves. But how bad &s;o many are, it cannot be denied but that there are al&s;o many both of the clergy and laity, who give great and real demon&s;trati|ons
<PB N="97" REF="028377_0094_0FD8DC4DD723DBD0">
of the power religion has over them; in their contempt of the world, the &s;trictne&s;s of their lives, their rea|dine&s;s to forgive injuries, to relieve the poor and to do good on all occa&s;i|ons. And yet even the&s;e may have their failings, either in &s;uch things wherein their con&s;titutions are weak, or their temptations &s;trong and &s;ud|den. And in all &s;uch ca&s;es we are to judge of men, rather by the cour&s;e of their lives, than by the errors that they through infirmity or &s;urpri&s;e may have &s;lipt into.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the chief heads we di&s;|cour&s;ed on; and as far as I can re|member, I have faithfully repeated the &s;ub&s;tance of our arguments. I have not concealed the &s;tronge&s;t things he &s;aid to me, but though I have not enlarged on all the excur&s;ions of his wit in &s;etting them off, yet I have gi|ven them their full &s;trength, as he ex|pre&s;&s;ed them; and as far as I could recollect, have u&s;ed his own words. So that I am afraid &s;ome may cen&s;ure me for &s;etting down the&s;e things &s;o

largely, which impious men may make an ill u&s;e of, and gather together to encourage and de&s;end them&s;elves in their vices. But if they will compare them with the an&s;wers made to them, and the &s;en&s;e that &s;o great and refined a wit had of them afterwards, I hope they may through the ble&s;&s;ing of God be not altogether ineffectual.</P>
<P>The i&s;&s;ue of all our di&s;cour&s;e was this; he told me, he &s;aw vice and impiety were as contrary to human &s;ociety, as wild bea&s;ts let loo&s;e would be; and therefore he firmly re&s;olved to change the whole method of his life, to become &s;trictly ju&s;t and true, to be cha&s;te and temperate, to forbear &s;wearing and irreligious di&s;cour&s;e, to wor&s;hip and pray to his maker. And that though he was not arrived at a full per&s;ua&s;ion of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> he would never employ his wit more to run it down, or to corrupt others.</P>
<P>Of which I have &s;ince a further a&s;|&s;urance from a per&s;on of quality, who conver&s;ed much with him, the la&s;t year of his life; to whom he would
<PB N="99" REF="028377_0096_0FD8DC53DD7D4D18">
often &s;ay, that he was happy, if he did believe, and that he would never endeavour to draw him from it.</P>
<P>To all this I an&s;wered, that a vir|tuous life would be very unea&s;y to him, unle&s;s vicious inclinations were remo|ved. It would otherwi&s;e be a perpe|tual con&s;traint. Nor could it be ef|fected without an inward principle to change him; and that was only to be had by applying him&s;elf to God for it in frequent and earne&s;t prayers. And I was &s;ure if his mind were once clear|ed of the&s;e di&s;orders, and cured of tho&s;e di&s;tempers, which vice brought on it, &s;o great an under&s;tanding would &s;oon &s;ee through all tho&s;e flights of wit, that do feed athei&s;m and irreligi|on; which have a fal&s;e glittering in them, that dazzles &s;ome weak-fighted minds, who have not capacity enough to penetrate further than the &s;urfaces of things: and &s;o they &s;tick in the&s;e toils, which the &s;trength of his mind would &s;oon break through, if it were once freed from tho&s;e things that de|pre&s;&s;ed and darkened it.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="028377_0097_0FD8DC58D3B81498">At this pa&s;s he was when he went from <HI>London,</HI> about the beginning of April. He had not been long in the country when he thought he was &s;o well, that being to go to his e&s;tate in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI> he rode thither po&s;t. This heat and violent motion did &s;o inflame an ulcer, that was in his blad|der, that it rai&s;ed a very great pain in tho&s;e parts. Yet he with much difficulty came back by coach to the Lodge at <HI>Wood&s;tock-Park.</HI> He was then wounded both in body and mind. He under&s;tood phy&s;ic and his own con&s;titution and di&s;temper &s;o well, that he concluded he could hardly re|cover: for the ulcer broke and va&s;t quantities of purulent matter pa&s;t with his urine. But now the hand of God touched him, and as he told me, it was not only a general dark melan|choly over his mind, &s;uch as he had formerly felt, but a mo&s;t penetrating cutting &s;orrow. So that though in his body he &s;uffered extreme pain for &s;ome weeks, yet the agonies of his
<PB N="101" REF="028377_0098_0FD8DC5BCAF86D08">
mind &s;ometimes &s;wallowed up the &s;en&s;e of what he felt in the body.</P>
<P>He told me, and gave it me in charge, to tell it to one for whom he was much concerned, that though there were nothing to come after this life, yet all the plea&s;ures he had ever known in &s;in, were not worth that torture he had felt in his mind. He con&s;idered he had not only neglected and di&s;honoured, but had openly defi|ed his Maker, and had drawn many others into the like impieties. So that he looked on him&s;elf as one that was in great danger of being damned. He then &s;et him&s;elf wholly to turn to God un&s;eignedly, and to do all that was po&s;&s;ible in that little remainder of his life which was before him, to redeem tho&s;e great portions of it, that he had formerly &s;o ill employed.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter that attended con&s;tant|ly on him, was that good and worthy man Mr. <HI>Par&s;ons,</HI> his mother's chap|lain, who hath &s;ince his death preach|ed, according to the directions he re|ceived from him, his funeral &s;ermon;
<PB N="102" REF="028377_0099_0FD8DCA126C08070">
in which there are &s;o many remarka|ble pa&s;&s;ages, that I &s;hall refer my reader to them, and will repeat none of them here, that I may not thereby le&s;&s;en his de&s;ire to edefy him&s;elf by that excellent di&s;cour&s;e, which has given &s;o great and &s;o general a &s;atis|faction to all good and judicious read|ers. I &s;hall &s;peak cur&s;orily of every thing, but that which I had immedi|ately from him&s;elf. He was vi&s;ited every week of his &s;ickne&s;s by his Dio|ce&s;an, that truly primitive prelate, the lord bi&s;hop of Oxford, Dr. <HI>Fell;</HI> who though he lived &s;ix miles from him, yet looked on this as &s;o import|ant a piece of his pa&s;toral care, that he went often to him; and treated him with that decent plainne&s;s and freedom which is &s;o natural to him; and took care al&s;o that he might not on terms more ea&s;y than &s;afe, be at peace with him&s;elf. Dr. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> the learned and worthy rector of Lincoln College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> being the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h, was al&s;o frequently with him; and by the&s;e helps he was &s;o di|rected

and &s;upported, that he might not on the one hand &s;atisfy him&s;elf with too &s;uperficial a repentance, nor on the other hand be out of mea&s;ure oppre&s;&s;ed with a &s;orrow without hope.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I heard he was ill, but yet in &s;uch a condition that I might write to him, I wrote a letter to the be&s;t purpo&s;e I could. He ordered one that was then with him, to a&s;&s;ure me it was very welcome to him: but not &s;atisfied with that, he &s;ent me an an|&s;wer, which, as the counte&s;s of <HI>Ro|che&s;ter</HI> his mother told me, he dictated every word, and then &s;igned it.</P>
<P>I was once unwilling to have pub|li&s;hed it, becau&s;e of a compliment in it to my&s;elf, far above my merit, and not very well &s;uiting with his conditi|on.</P>

<P>He told me when I &s;aw him, that he hoped I would come to him upon that general in&s;inuation of the de&s;ire he had of my company; and he was loth to write more plainly; not know|ing whether I could ea&s;ily &s;pare &s;o much time. I told him, that on the other hand, I looked on it as a pre|&s;umption to come &s;o far, when he was in &s;uch excellent hands; and though perhaps the freedom formerly between us, might have excu&s;ed it with tho&s;e to whom it was known; yet it might have the appearance of &s;o much vani|ty, to &s;uch as were &s;trangers to it; &s;o that till I received his letter, I did not think it convenient to come to him: and then not hearing that there was any danger of a &s;udden change, I de|layed going to him till the twentieth of July.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="028377_0103_0FD8DC6A58FE7FA0">At my coming to his hou&s;e, an ac|cident fell out not worth mentioning, but that &s;ome have made a &s;tory of it.

He told me, as his &s;trength &s;erved him at &s;everal &s;natches, for he was then &s;o low, that he could not hold up di&s;cour&s;e long at once, what &s;en&s;e he had of his pa&s;t life; what &s;ad apprehen&s;ion for having &s;o offended his maker, and di&s;honoured his re|deemer; what horrors he had gone through, and how much his mind was turned to call on God, and on his cru|cified Saviour So that he hoped he &s;hould obtain mercy, for he believed he had &s;incerely repented; and had now a calm in his mind after that &s;torm that he had been in for &s;ome weeks.</P>
<P>He had &s;trong apprehen&s;ions and per&s;ua&s;ions of his admittance to hea|ven; of which he &s;pake once not with|out &s;ome extraordinary emotion. It was indeed the only time that he &s;pake with any great warmth to me; for his &s;pirits were then low, and &s;o far &s;pent, that though tho&s;e about him told me, he had expre&s;&s;ed formerly great &s;ervour in his devotions; yet na|ture was &s;o much &s;unk, that the&s;e were in a great mea&s;ure fallen off.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="028377_0105_0FD8DC72A380A750">But he made me pray often with him; and &s;poke of his conver&s;ion to God as a thing now grown up in him to a &s;ettled and calm &s;erenity.

I told him, that before I gave any re&s;oluti|on in that, it would be convenient that I &s;hould be acquainted more particu|larly with the circum&s;tances and pro|gre&s;s of his repentance.</P>
<P>Upon this he &s;atisfied me in many particulars. He &s;aid, he was now per&s;uaded both of the truth of Chri&s;|tianity, and of the power of inward grace, of which he gave me this &s;trange account. He &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> in order to his conviction, read to him the 53d chapter of the prophecy of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> and compared that with the hi&s;tory of our Saviour's pa&s;&s;ion, that he might there &s;ee a prophecy con|cerning it, written many ages before it was done; which the <HI>Jews</HI> that bla&s;phemed Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;till kept in their hands, as a book divinely in&s;pi|red. He &s;aid to me, that as he heard
<PB N="109" REF="028377_0106_0FD8DC72A5A953B0">
it read, he felt an inward force upon him, which did &s;o enlighten his mind, and convince him, that he could re&s;i&s;t it no longer: for the words had an authority which did &s;hoot like rays or beams in his mind; &s;o that he was not only convinced by the rea&s;onings he had about it, which &s;atisfied his under|&s;tanding, but by a power which did &s;o effectually con&s;train him, that he did ever after as firmly believe in his Saviour, as if he had &s;een him in the clouds.</P>
<P>He had made it be read &s;o often to him, that he had got it by heart: and went through a great part of it in di&s;|cour&s;e with me, with a &s;ort of hea|venly plea&s;ure, giving me his reflecti|ons on it. Some few I remember, <HI>Who hath believed our report?</HI> v. 1.

<P>What he &s;aid on the other parts I do not well remember: and indeed I was &s;o affected with what he &s;aid then to me, that the general tran&s;port I was under during the whole di&s;cour&s;e, made me le&s;s capable to remember the&s;e particulars, as I wi&s;h I had done.</P>
<P>He told me, that he had thereupon received the &s;acrament with great &s;a|tisfaction, and that was increa&s;ed by the plea&s;ure he had in his lady's re|ceiving it with him; who had been for &s;ome years mi&s;led into the commu|nion of the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and he him&s;elf had been not a little in&s;tru|mental in procuring it, as he freely acknowledged. So that it was one of the joyfulle&s;t things that befel him in his &s;ickne&s;s, that he had &s;een that mi&s;|chief removed, in which he had &s;o great a hand,</P>
<P>And during his whole &s;ickne&s;s, he expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much tenderne&s;s and true
<PB N="111" REF="028377_0108_0FD8DC789BC09958">
kindne&s;s to his lady, that as it ea&s;ily defaced the remembrance of every thing wherein he had been in fault formerly, &s;o it drew from her the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate care and concern for him that was po&s;&s;ible; which indeed de&s;erves a higher character than is de|cent to give of a per&s;on yet alive. But I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the dead.</P>
<P>He told me, he had overcome all his re&s;entments to all the world; &s;o that he bore ill-will to no per&s;on, nor hated any upon per&s;onal accounts. He had given a true &s;tate of his debts, and had ordered to pay them all, as far as his e&s;tate that was not &s;ettled, could go: and was confident that if all that was owing to him were paid to his executors, his creditors would be all &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, he found his mind now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with another &s;en&s;e of things, than ever he had formerly. He did not repine under all his pain, and in one of the &s;harpe&s;t fits he was under while I was with him, he &s;aid, he did willingly &s;ubmit; and looking up to

He was con&s;ident he &s;hould be happy if he died, but he feared if he lived he might relap&s;e. And then &s;aid he to me, in what a condition &s;hall I be, if I relap&s;e after all this? But, he &s;aid, he tru&s;ted in the grace and good|ne&s;s of God, and was re&s;olved to avoid all tho&s;e temptations, that cour&s;e of life and company, that was likely to in&s;nare him: and he de&s;ired to live on no other account, but that he might by the change of his manners &s;ome way take off the high &s;candal his for|mer behaviour had given. All the&s;e things at &s;everal times I had from him, be&s;ides &s;ome me&s;&s;ages which very well became a dying penitent to &s;ome of his former friends, and a charge to publi&s;h any thing concerning him, that might be a means to reclaim others.

now grown up into a &s;ettled faith and conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is but one prejudice lies a|gain&s;t all this, to defeat the good ends of divine providence by it upon others, as well as on him&s;elf; and that is, it was a part of his di&s;ea&s;e, and that the low|ne&s;s of his &s;pirits made &s;uch an altera|tion in him, that he was not what he had formerly been: and this &s;ome have carried &s;o far as to &s;ay, that he died mad.

<P>That this lord was either mad or &s;tupid, is a thing &s;o notoriou&s;ly untrue, that it is the greate&s;t impudence for any that were about him, to report

it; and a very unrea&s;onable credulity in others to believe it. All the while I was with him, after he had &s;lept out the di&s;orders of the fit, he was not on|ly without ravings, but had a clear|ne&s;s in his thoughts, in his memory, in his reflections on things and per&s;ons, far beyond what I ever &s;aw in a per|&s;on &s;o low in his &s;trength. He was not able to hold out long in di&s;cour&s;e, for his &s;pirits failed; but once for half an hour, and often for a quarter of an hour, after he awakened, he had a vivacity in his di&s;cour&s;e that was extraordinary, and in all things like him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He called often for his children, his &s;on the now earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and his three daughters, and &s;pake to them with a &s;en&s;e and feeling that cannot be expre&s;&s;ed in writing.</P>
<P>He called me once to look on them all, and &s;aid, &s;ee how good God has been to me, in giving me &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings, and I have carried my&s;elf to him like an ungracious and un|thankful dog.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="028377_0113_0FD8DC8C85825EB0">He once talked a great deal to me of public affairs, and of many per&s;ons and things, with the &s;ame clearne&s;s of thought and expre&s;&s;ion, that he had ever done before.

<P>And that wherein the pre&s;ence of his mind appeared mo&s;t, was in the total change of an ill habit grown &s;o much upon him, that he could hardly govern him&s;elf, when he was any ways heated, three minutes without falling into it; I mean &s;wearing.</P>
<P>He had acknowledged to me the former winter, that he abhorred it as a ba&s;e and indecent thing, and had &s;et him&s;elf much to break it off; but he confe&s;&s;ed that he was &s;o over pow|ered by that ill cu&s;tom, that he could not &s;peak with any warmth, without repeated oaths, which, upon any &s;ort of provocation, came almo&s;t naturally from him.

this did &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affect him, that by a re&s;olute and con&s;tant watchfulne&s;s, the habit of it was perfectly ma&s;tered; &s;o that upon the returns of pain which were very &s;evere and frequent upon him, the la&s;t day I was with him; or upon &s;uch di&s;plea&s;ures as people &s;ick or in pain are apt to take of a &s;udden at tho&s;e about them: on all the&s;e occa&s;i|ons he never &s;wore an oath all the while I was there.</P>
<P>Once he was offended with the delay of one that he thought made not ha&s;te enough, with &s;ome what he called for, and &s;aid in a little heat, <HI>that d&mdash;d fellow.</HI> Soon after I told him, I was glad to find his &s;tyle &s;o reformed, and that he had &s;o entirely overcome that ill habit of &s;wearing; only that word of calling any d&mdash;d, which had re|turned upon him, was not decent.</P>
<P>His an&s;wer was, Oh that language of fiends which was &s;o familiar to me, hangs yet about me: &s;ure none has de&s;erved more to be damned than I have done. And after he had hum|bly a&s;ked God pardon for it, he de&s;i|red

<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition of mind did he continue all the while I was with him, four day's together; he was then brought &s;o low that all hope of reco|very was gone. Much purulent mat|ter came from him with his urine, which he pa&s;&s;ed always with &s;ome pain; but one day with unexpre&s;&s;ible torment. Yet bore it decently with|out breaking out into repinings, or impatient complaints. He imagined he had a &s;tone in his pa&s;&s;age, but it being &s;earched, none was found.</P>
<P>The whole &s;ub&s;tance of his body was drained by the ulcer, and nothing was left but &s;kin and bone; and by lying much on his back, the parts there began to mortify. But he had been formerly &s;o low, that he &s;eemed as much pa&s;t all hopes of life as now; which made him one morning after a full and &s;weet night's re&s;t procured by

laudanum, given him without his knowledge, to fancy it was an effort of nature, and to begin to entertain &s;ome hopes of recovery: for he &s;aid, he felt him&s;elf perfectly well, and that he had nothing ailing him, but an ex|treme weakne&s;s, which might go off in time; and then he entertained me with the &s;cheme he had laid down for the re&s;t of his life, how retired, how &s;trict, and how &s;tudious he intended to be. But this was &s;oon over, for he quickly felt that it was only the effect of a good &s;leep, and that he was &s;till in a very de&s;perate &s;tate.</P>
<P>I thought to have left him on Fri|day, but not without &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion, he de&s;ired me to &s;tay that day. There appeared no &s;ymptom of pre&s;ent death, and a worthy phy&s;ician then with him told me, that though he was &s;o low that an accident might carry him away on a &s;udden; yet without that, he thought he might live yet &s;ome weeks.</P>
<P>So on Saturday at four o'clock in the morning I left him, being the 24th

But I dur&s;t not take leave of him; for he had expre&s;&s;ed &s;o great an unwillingne&s;s to part with me the day before, that if I had not pre&s;ent|ly yielded to one day's &s;tay, it was like to have given him &s;ome trouble, therefore I thought it better to leave him without any formality.

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THUS he lived, and thus he died, in the three and thirtieth year of his age. Nature had fitted him for great things, and his knowledge and ob&s;er|vation qualified him to have been one of the mo&s;t extraordinary men, not only of his nation, but of the age he lived in: and I do verily believe, that if God had thought fit to have conti|nued him longer in the world, he had been the wonder and delight of all that knew him.</P>
<P>But the infinitely wi&s;e God knew better what was fit for him, and what the age de&s;erved. For men who have &s;o ca&s;t off all &s;en&s;e of God and religi|on, de&s;erve not &s;o &s;ignal a ble&s;&s;ing, as
<PB N="122" REF="028377_0119_0FD8DC9B20E3B938">
the example and conviction which the re&s;t of his life might have given them.</P>
<P>And I am apt to think that the di|vine goodne&s;s took pity on him, and &s;eeing the &s;incerity of his repentance, would try and venture him no more in circum&s;tances of temptation, per|haps too hard for human frailty.</P>
<P>Now he is at re&s;t, and I am very confident enjoys the fruits of his late, but &s;incere repentance. But &s;uch as live, and &s;till go on in their &s;ins and impieties, and will not be awakened neither by this, nor the other alarms that are about their ears, are, it &s;eems given up by God to a judicial hardne&s;s and impenitency,</P>
<P>Here is a public in&s;tance of one who lived of their &s;ide, but could not die of it: and though none of all our li|bertines under&s;tood better than he, the &s;ecret my&s;teries of &s;in, had more &s;tudied every thing that could &s;upport a man in it, and had more re&s;i&s;ted all external means of conviction than he had done; yet when the hand of God inwardly touched him, he could no
<PB N="123" REF="028377_0120_0FD8DC9D58B30B38">
longer kick again&s;t tho&s;e pricks, but humbled him&s;elf under that mighty hand; and as he u&s;ed often to &s;ay in his prayers, he who had &s;o often de|nied him, found then no other &s;helter, but his mercies and compa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I have written this account with all the tenderne&s;s and caution I could u&s;e, and in what&s;oever I may have failed, I have been &s;trict in the truth of what I have related, remembering that of Job, Will ye lie for God?</P>
<P>Religion has &s;trength and evidence enough in it&s;elf, and needs no &s;upport from lies and made &s;tories. I do not pretend to have given the formal words that he &s;aid, though I have done that where I could remember them. But I have written this with the &s;ame &s;incerity, that I would have done, had I known I had been to die immediately after I had fini&s;hed it.</P>
<P>I did not take notes of our di&s;cour|&s;es la&s;t winter after we parted; &s;o I may perhaps in the &s;etting out of my an&s;wers to him, have enlarged on &s;e|veral things both more fully and more

regularly, than I could &s;ay them in &s;uch free di&s;cour&s;es as we had. I am not &s;o &s;ure of all I &s;et down as &s;aid by me, as I am of all &s;aid by him to me. But yet the &s;ub&s;tance of the greate&s;t part, even of that, is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It remains that I humbly and ear|ne&s;tly be&s;eech all that &s;hall take this book in their hands, that they will con&s;ider it entirely, and not wre&s;t &s;ome parts to an ill intention. God, the &s;earcher of hearts, knows with what fidelity I have writ it. But if any will drink up only the poi&s;on that may be in it, without taking al&s;o the anti|dote here given to tho&s;e ill principles; or con&s;idering the &s;en&s;e that this great per&s;on had of them, when he reflect|ed &s;eriou&s;ly on them; and will rather confirm them&s;elves in their ill ways, by the &s;cruples and objections which I &s;et down, than be edified by the other parts of it; as I will look on it as a great infelicity, that I &s;hould have &s;aid any thing that may &s;trengthen them in their impieties, &s;o the &s;inceri|ty of my intentions will, I doubt not,

<P>I have now performed, in the be&s;t manner I could, what was left on me by this noble lord, and have done with the part of an hi&s;torian. I &s;hall in the next place &s;ay &s;omewhat as a divine.

thoughts of death mu&s;t be always me|lancholy to them, they can have no plea&s;ant view of that which yet they know cannot be very far from them. The lea&s;t painful idea they can have of it is, that it is an extinction and cea&s;ing to be, but they are not &s;ure even of that. Some &s;ecret whi&s;pers within make them, whether they will or not, tremble at the apprehen&s;ions of another &s;tate; neither their tin&s;el wit, nor &s;uperficial learning, nor their impotent a&s;&s;aults upon the weak &s;ide as they think of religion, nor the bold|e&s;t notions of impiety, will hold them up then. Of all which I now pre&s;ent &s;o lively an in&s;tance, as perhaps hi&s;to|ry can &s;carce parellel.</P>
<P>Here were parts &s;o exalted by na|ture, and improved by &s;tudy, and yet &s;o corrupted and deba&s;ed by irre|ligion and vice, that he who was made to be one of the glories of his age was become a proverb, and if his repent|ance had not interpo&s;ed, would have been one of the greate&s;t reproaches of it. He knew well the &s;mall &s;trength

of that weak cau&s;e, and at fir&s;t de&s;pi|&s;ed, but afterwards abhorred it. He felt the mi&s;chiefs, and &s;aw the mad|ne&s;s of it; and therefore though he lived to the &s;candal of many, he died as much to the edefication of all tho&s;e who &s;aw him; and becau&s;e they were but a &s;mall number, he de&s;ired that he might even when dead, yet &s;peak. He was willing nothing &s;hould be con|cealed that might ca&s;t reproach on him&s;elf, and on &s;in, and offer up glo|ry to God and religion. So that though he lived a heinous &s;inner, yet he died a mo&s;t exemplary penitent.</P>
<P>It would be a vain and ridiculous inference, for any from hence to draw arguments about the ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ecrets of prede&s;tination; and to conclude that if they are of the number of the elect, they may live as they will, and that divine grace will at &s;ome time or other violently con&s;train them, and irre&s;i&s;tably work upon them. But as St. <HI>Paul</HI> was called to that eminent &s;er|vice for which he was appointed, in &s;o &s;tupendous a manner, as is no warrant
<PB N="134" REF="028377_0131_0FD8DCB88E6FA5F0">
for others to expect a vocation; &s;o if upon &s;ome &s;ignal occa&s;ions &s;uch con|ver&s;ions fall out, which, how far they are &s;hort of miracles, I &s;hall not de|termine, it is not only a vain but a pernicious imagination, for any to go on in their ill ways, upon a fond con|ceit and expectation that the like will befal them. For what&s;oever God's extraordinary dealings with &s;ome may be, we are &s;ure his common way of working is by offering the&s;e things to our rational faculties, which, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his grace, if we improve them all we can, &s;hall be certainly effectual for our reformation; and if we neglect or abu&s;e the&s;e, we put our&s;elves beyond the common methods of God's mercy, and have no rea&s;on to expect that wonders &s;hould be wrought for our conviction; which though they &s;ometimes happen, that they may give an effectual alarm for the awaking of others, yet it would de&s;troy the whole de&s;ign of religion, if men &s;hould depend upon, or look for &s;uch an extraordinary and forcible operations of God's grace.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="028377_0132_0FD8DCBEB8593F48">And I hope that tho&s;e who have had &s;ome &s;harp reflections on their pa&s;t life, &s;o as to be re&s;olved to for&s;ake their ill cour&s;es, will not take the lea&s;t encouragement to them&s;elves in that de&s;perate and unrea&s;onable re&s;olution of puttnig off their repentance till they can &s;in no longer, from the hopes I have expre&s;s'd of this Lord's obtaining mercy at the la&s;t; and from thence pre&s;ume that they al&s;o &s;hall be receiv|ed, when they turn to God on their death-beds. For what mercy &s;oever God may &s;hew to &s;uch as really were never inwardly touched before that time; yet there is no rea&s;on to think that tho&s;e who have dealt &s;o di&s;inge|nuou&s;ly with God and their own &s;ouls, as de&s;ignedly to put off their turning to him, upon &s;uch con&s;iderations, &s;hould be then excepted with him.</P>
<P>They may die &s;uddenly, or by a di&s;ea&s;e that may &s;o di&s;order their un|der&s;tandings, that they &s;hall not be in any capacity of reflecting on their pa&s;t lives. The inward conver&s;ion of our minds is not &s;o in our power, that
<PB N="136" REF="028377_0133_0FD8DCC0132E08C0">
it can be effected without divine grace a&s;&s;i&s;ting. And there is no rea&s;on for tho&s;e who have neglected the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;t|ances all their lives, to expect them in &s;o extraordinary a manner at their death. Nor can one, e&s;pecially in a &s;ickne&s;s, that is quick and critical, be able to do tho&s;e things that are often indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to make his re|pentance complete: and even in a longer di&s;ea&s;e, in which there are lar|ger opportunities for the&s;e things. Yet there is great rea&s;on to doubt of a repentance begun and kept up mere|ly by terror, and not from any inge|nuous principle. In which, though I will not take on me to limit the mer|cies of God, which are boundle&s;s, yet this mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that to delay repentance, with &s;uch a de&s;ign, is to put the greate&s;t concernment that we have, upon the mo&s;t dangerous and de&s;perate i&s;&s;ue that is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But they that will &s;till go on in their &s;ins, and be &s;o partial to them, as to cea&s;e all endeavours to &s;trengthen them|&s;elves in their evil cour&s;e, even by

the&s;e very things which the providence of God &s;ets before them, for the ca&s;t|ing down of the&s;e &s;trong holds of &s;in: What is to be &s;aid to &s;uch?
