<P>_THE Lord our GOD, who reigns King forever, is the hope of I&s;rael and the Saviour thereof in time of Trouble: And he invites his People under Publick Calamities to come, and enter into the Cham|bers of his Protection till the in|dignation be overpa&s;t; a&s;&s;uring us that he who dwells in the &s;ecret place of the mo&s;t High, &s;hall abide under the &s;hadow of the Almighty.

<HEAD>PROP. I. <HI>THE Lord Jehovah is the Judge of his Church and People.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Verb</HI> is ob&s;erv'd to &s;ignify to Judge, to pa&s;s Sentence, and to execute Judgment. The Power of a Judge is Executive, and his Bu&s;ine&s;s is to take care that the Laws be duly Executed. As the Word is u&s;ed in Scripture, and applyed to GOD, it &s;ignifieth his plead|ing the Cau&s;e of his People, and delivering them out of the hands of them that oppre&s;s them. GOD is the Judge of all Men, and hath appointed a Day in which he will Judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, by that Man whom he hath Ordained. But then this is the peculiar Privilege of the People of GOD, that their<PB N="3" REF="002957_0006_0FE6A564428464D8">Lord is their Judge. Thus it is promi&s;ed, Deut. 32.36. <HI>The Lord &s;hall judge his People.</HI> Heb. 12.22. Ye are come unto Mount Zion, to GOD the <HI>Judge of all.</HI> And indeed the&s;e words of our Text may look forward as far as the la&s;t and general Judgment. The Servants of GOD commit their cau&s;e unto him, and he doth and will appear to doe them Ju&s;tice again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ours. They have a gracious and favourable acce&s;s to GOD's Judgment Seat, and it is their &s;trong Con&s;olation that all Judgment is committed to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their Head and Redeemer: Having their Per&s;ons ju&s;tified thro' his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and being &s;anctified by his Spirit; They may &s;ay, Job 13.18, 19. <HI>I know I &s;hall be ju&s;tified. Who is he that will plead with me?</HI> Here to &s;hew what may be implied in GOD's being the Judge of his People. We may &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS may imply, <HI>That GOD appoints and orders out to them the Judgments inflicted on them in this Life.</HI></P>
<P>GOD in his Providence cha&s;ti&s;eth his People for their Iniquities in this Life; but then he Corrects them with <HI>Judgment.</HI> He &s;ometimes makes u&s;e even of wicked Men, as the Rod of his Anger in this mat|ter; however he &s;ets bounds to their Rage. There's a va&s;t difference between the Judgments GOD brings on his People, and on impenitent Sinners, as to the ground of them, and their final I&s;&s;ue. GOD loveth his People while he cha&s;tens them; he de&s;igns their Good by their Afflictions, and gives them rea&s;on to &s;ay, It is good for them that they have been afflicted. 1 Cor. 11.32. <HI>When we are judged, we are cha&s;tened of the Lord, that we &s;hould not be condemned with the world.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD will acquit his People, and declare their Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>IN this World their Judgment is often taken away. Their Right is turned away before the mo&s;t High, and their Cau&s;e perverted. Many a time have they been mi&s;repre&s;ented accus'd and condemn'd unju&s;tly;
<PB N="4" REF="002957_0007_0FE6A5AAF8A870B8">but GOD will admit their Appeal, and rever&s;e the&s;e Judgments. Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do Right? Mo&s;t certainly he will. The great Day will be the Revelation of the Judgment of GOD, when all &s;hall be able to di&s;cern between the Righ|teous and the Wicked, and be obliged to own, <HI>There is a GOD who judgeth in the Earth.</HI> For then will he give to his People the <HI>white Stone</HI> in the mo&s;t Publick manner, and pronounce them Righ|teous before the whole World. Their Judgment &s;hall be brought forth as the light, and their Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s as the Noon-day. P&s;al. 96.10. &mdash; <HI>He &s;hall judge the people righteou&s;ly.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. As their Judge, <HI>GOD will give his People a glorious Reward.</HI></P>
<P>THE Lord JESUS CHRIST who hath purchas'd the recompence of Reward by his perfect Obedience in doing and &s;uffering the Will of GOD, makes that gracious Promi&s;e, <HI>Be thou &s;aithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 2.10.</NOTE>. The SON OF GOD will Reward his People according to their Works, tho' all be of free Grace. Some Rewards he gives his Di&s;ciples upon Earth as an Earne&s;t: There are temporal and &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, which they now receive, and in the great Day of Judgment they &s;hall receive a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. 2 Tim. 4.8. <HI>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord the righteous Judge &s;hall give at that Day; and not to me only; but to all them that love his appearing.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. IT may imply, <HI>That GOD will execute Judg|ment on their implacable Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>VENGEANCE is the LORD'S, and he will repay it. 2 The&s;. 1.6. <HI>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you,</HI> GOD hath often appear'd for his People in the Judg|ments which he hath executed on their Enemies.
<PB N="5" REF="002957_0008_0FE6A571610B03D0">Thus he appear'd as the Judge of his People when he over-threw <HI>Pharoah</HI> and his Ho&s;t in the Red-Sea. Thus did he appear when he rais'd up <HI>Judges</HI> who were In&s;truments in his hand of delivering his People, and de&s;troying their Enemies. Thus will CHRIST appear when he &s;hall de&s;troy <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> by the Brightne&s;s of his Coming. And thus in an emi|nent manner, when he &s;hall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming Fire, taking Ven|geance on them that know not his Name, and obey not his Go&s;pel
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 The&s; 1.8, 9.</NOTE>. For then &s;hall <HI>tho&s;e Enemies of GOD and his People,</HI> be <HI>puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting De&s;truction from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, and the glory of his Power.</HI></P>
<P>USE 2. LEARN, <HI>That it is a very dangerous thing fal&s;ely to Accu&s;e, and wrongfully Condemn the People of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>IT hath been common for them to have things laid to their Charge they are not guilty of. The Chri&s;tians were a <HI>Sect every where &s;poken again&s;t,</HI> Acts 28.22. They are often dre&s;s'd up in Bear-skins that they may be baited. But Wo to &s;uch as do in this way hinder them from doing or receiving Good: For GOD will plead their Cau&s;e in the Day of Ven|geance. And dreadful, very dreadful will their Con|demnation be who &s;hall then be found guilty of this crying Sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THIS &s;hould Comfort GOD's People under all the Reproaches &amp; Evils they are loaded with in this World.</HI></P>
<P>WHO is he that Condemneth, it is GOD that Ju&s;tifieth? They may indeed for the pre&s;ent be under great difficulties upon this account. Men may &s;peak evil of them, and they may be loaded with Cur&s;es; but GOD will Ble&s;s. They &s;hall be <HI>clothed in white Raiment,</HI> and CHRIST will not blot out their Names out of the Book of Life; but will confe&s;s them before his Father, and the holy Angels. They may now lie
<PB N="6" REF="002957_0009_0FE6A5AC68641298">in the Du&s;t; but they &s;hall ari&s;e &amp; &s;hine; and the things that now ob&s;cure them, &s;hall be done away as the &s;hades of the Night are cha&s;ed away before the ri|&s;ing Sun. Now this con&s;ideration &s;hou'd Comfort the faithful Servants of GOD under Reproaches, and En|courage them to commit them&s;elves to him that Judg|eth righteou&s;ly. The Apo&s;tle &s;ays, 1 Cor. 4.3. &mdash; <HI>With me it is a &s;mall thing that I &s;hould be judged of you, or man's judgment.</HI> &mdash; ver. 4. &mdash; <HI>He that judgeth me is the Lord.</HI> If we approve our&s;elves to the Lord, and obtain his <HI>Euge,</HI> we are &s;afe and happy: and in the believing Pro&s;pect of this, GOD's People &s;hou'd now Rejoice.</P>
<P N="3">3. LET us not <HI>ra&s;hly Judge and Condemn one another.</HI></P>
<P>WE mu&s;t take heed we do not ra&s;hly Cen&s;ure others. Mat. 7.1. <HI>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</HI> Not that all Judging is unlawful; but for Men without any Call or Warrant from GOD to cite their Neighbour to their Bar, and pa&s;s Sentence again&s;t him; this is a great Evil we &s;hould beware of, and that from this Con&s;ideration, that the LORD is our Judge. Rom. 14.10. <HI>Why do&s;t thou judge thy brother? or why do&s;t thou &s;et at nought thy brother? for we &s;hall all &s;tand before the Judgment Seat of Chri&s;t.</HI> O let us look to our Hearts &amp; Ways, that our own Con&s;ciences may not condemn us! And not be ha&s;ty to condemn others. 1 Cor. 4.5. <HI>Therefore judge no|thing before the time, until the Lord come</HI> &mdash;.</P>

<HEAD>PROP. II. <HI>THE Lord Jehovah is the Law-giver of his People.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is GOD's Prerogative, who hath made all things, to give Law to the whole Creation. But in a pecu|liar manner GOD is a <HI>Law-giver</HI> to the <HI>moral World</HI> of Angels &amp; Men, who are Cau&s;es by Coun&s;el, and capable of under&s;tanding the Rules according to which GOD will have them Act. GOD is a Law-giver to all Men. He hath given them the moral Law which is of divine &amp; unchangeable Right. And tho' this Law which was at fir&s;t written on Man's Heart in a fair
<PB N="7" REF="002957_0010_0FE6A571784D8360">Character be dreadfully defac'd by Sin, yet the mo&s;t barbarous Nations have &s;ome knowledge as of a Deity, &s;o his Law, by the Light of Nature, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.14, 15.</P>
<P>BUT now, GOD is in a more appropriate &s;en&s;e a Law-giver to his People, in that he gives them his <HI>written Word,</HI> and writes his Laws in their Hearts by his Spirit. P&s;al. 147.19, 20. <HI>He &s;heweth his word unto Jacob, his &s;tatutes and his judgments unto I&s;rael. He hath not dealt &s;o with any nation.</HI> GOD's ancient People received from him the <HI>Moral Law.</HI> Exod. 20. Deut. 32.2. <HI>The Lord came from mount Sinai &mdash; from his right hand went a fiery Law for them &mdash;. It was delivered out of the mid&s;t of the fire.</HI> The <HI>Ceremonial Law;</HI> containing the Ordinances of GOD's Wor&s;hip appropriated to the Church State under that Di&s;pen&s;a|tion. The <HI>Judicial Law;</HI> which was &s;uited to their Civil Polity, in which re&s;pect the Jewi&s;h Nation was a <HI>Theocracy.</HI> As to the Moral Law, our Saviour him|&s;elf hath &s;aid, <HI>I am not come to de&s;troy the Law and the 'Prophets, but to fulfil.</HI> As to the Ceremonial Law, this is aboli&s;h'd by CHRIST the Head. Eph. 2.15. <HI>He aboli&s;h'd in his fle&s;h the law of command|ments contain'd in ordinances.</HI> And now our SA|VIOUR as the only Head of his Church, and Lord of his own Hou&s;e, hath appointed tho&s;e Laws and Ordinances whereby he will have his profe&s;&s;ing Peo|ple govern'd to the End of the World. Mat. 28.10, 20. <HI>Go ye teach all Nations &mdash; Teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I have commanded you</HI> &mdash;. He hath given the mo&s;t excellent Rules for regulating his People both with re&s;pect to their inward and outward Man. And the&s;e bind the Con&s;cience; for they are His, who is the Lord of Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>USE, I. LEARN <HI>the great Sin &amp; Evil of Di&s;|obedience in a profe&s;&s;ing People.</HI></P>
<P>DISOBEDIENCE to the Laws of GOD, our Maker and Sovereign, mu&s;t needs be a great Evil. This brought Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion into the World at fir&s;t. The Sins of the Heathen are provoking to
<PB N="8" REF="002957_0011_0FE6A5AC84E91480">GOD, and render them obnoxious to his righteous Judgments. How much more heinous mu&s;t be the Sin of tho&s;e who have the written Word of GOD, GOD Articl'd again&s;t his People of old that he had <HI>written to them the great things of his Law, but they were counted as a &s;trange thing,</HI> Ho&s;. 8.12. O let us take Care then to yield Obedience to CHRIST: For to him that knows <HI>to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is Sin,</HI> Jam. 4, 17.

<P N="2">2. <HI>HOW happy are the Church and People of GOD who have GOD for their Law-giver.</HI></P>
<P>Deut. 4.7. <HI>What nation is there &s;o great, that hath Judgments &s;o righteous, as all this Law which I &s;et before you.</HI> The Laws of GOD are all holy, ju&s;t and good. There's nothing oppre&s;&s;ive in them. <HI>CHRIST's Yoke is Ea&s;y</HI> &mdash; None of his Com|mands are grievous. Indeed the Lu&s;ts of Men make them unea&s;y under them; but they are all &s;uited to make his People holy and happy. O happy! thrice happy, did we under&s;tand our Privilege in this re&s;pect.

GOD hath taken from us a KING Renown'd for Wi&s;dom and Council, Courage and Firmne&s;s of Mind, Application to Bu&s;ine&s;s and Quick Di&s;patch; a KING who&s;e Acce&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Briti&s;h Throne</HI> was e&s;teem'd by Wi&s;e Di&s;cerners of the times, as Life from the Dead to his Dominions, and the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t; a KING whom GOD hath highly honour'd in the great E&s;teem he had given him at Home and Abroad, in his very Exten&s;ive Influence, and the mighty things GOD had done for him and by him. But I pre&s;ume not to draw his <HI>Character;</HI> an attempt too great and high for me. My main de&s;ign is to make a <HI>Religious Improvement</HI> of this &s;urpri&s;ing Providence: Hath GOD remov'd our KING in this <HI>Critical Juncture,</HI> when Affairs &s;till look with a dubious A&s;pect, when the Eyes of &s;o many were upon him, and his People might be ready to &s;ay, under his &s;hadow we &s;hall live. Let us then <HI>Cea&s;e from Man who&s;e Breath is in his No&s;trils.</HI> The Lord now &s;peaks once, yea twice, in his Word and by his Providence, and his Voice to us is that, P&s;al. 146.3, 4. <HI>Put not your tru&s;t in Princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts
<PB N="22" REF="002957_0025_0FE6A5C7603F10E0">peri&s;h.</HI> I&s;a. 2.22. Cea&s;e ye from Man, who&s;e breath is in his No&s;trils: <HI>for wherein is he to be accounted of.</HI> All Nations before GOD are as nothing, and they are counted to him le&s;s then nothing and vanity. GOD holds the breath of the mo&s;t Mighty Princes in his hand, and can &s;top it in a Moment. And while they Live they can be no more to us than he is plea&s;ed to make them. In vain is Salvation hoped for from the&s;e Hills &mdash; in the Lord our GOD is the Salvation of his People. And therefore while we give them that honor which is their dne. We mu&s;t <HI>look off</HI> from them, not tru&s;ting in an Arm of Fle&s;h. And on the contrary, <HI>We &s;hould look to our Glorious Lord, who is King in Zion, and place our tru&s;t in him.</HI> This is our Support that the Lord Omnipotent reigns. The Great GOD our Saviour te&s;tifieth, Rev. 1.18. <HI>I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive forever more,</HI> Amen; and have the Keys of Hell
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or the invi&s;ible World, <HI>Hades.</HI></NOTE> and of Death. O let us then lift up our Eyes unto him from whom cometh our help, and put our tru&s;t under his &s;hadow. For of this King it may truly be &s;aid as, I&s;a. 32.2. <HI>A man &s;hall be as an hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempe&s;t: as rivers of water in a dry place, as the &s;hadow of a great rock in a weary land.</HI> O Afflicted People of GOD! fly for refuge to lay hold on the Hope &s;et before you in your Saviour, who is the Mighty GOD, the Everla&s;ting Father, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 9.6. For Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man that hath the GOD of Jacob for his help, who&s;e hope is in the Lord his GOD
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 146.5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AND now, <HI>Let us Prai&s;e the Lord, who hath not left his Briti&s;h-I&s;rael, as Sheep without a Shepherd.</HI> Here is light ari&s;ing to us under our darkne&s;s: GOD hath Ordained a Lamp to his Servant, a Son and Succe&s;&s;or, and that not a Child; but a Prince in his full Strength for Council and Action. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> in the Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of HANOVER <HI>abides</HI> before him. The KING lives in
<PB N="23" REF="002957_0026_0FE6A5D37388D730">his SON, and we behold our rightful and lawful KING <HI>GEORGE</HI> the <HI>Second,</HI> whom GOD long Pre|&s;erve! peaceably &s;eated on his Throne. amid&s;t the joyful Acclamations of his dutiful People; yea we hear Him declaring from the Throne, That the <HI>Re|ligion, Laws &amp; Liberties of the Kingdom are mo&s;t dear to Him.</HI> We al&s;o with plea&s;ure behold him Ble&s;&s;ed of GOD with a mo&s;t <HI>gracious QUEEN,</HI> who is truly a <HI>Crown</HI> to her <HI>Husband,</HI> and by whom He is &s;trengthned with a <HI>Royal Offspring,</HI> Our <HI>Hope,</HI> GOD grant they may be the <HI>Joy</HI> of Po&s;terity. The LORD build his Servant a &s;ure Hou&s;e; make his Name better, and his Throne greater, even than his Royal FATHER's Throne. The LORD pour out his SPIRIT upon Him in all Princely Gifts &amp; Graces. The LORD give his Servant an under&s;tanding Heart to Judge his People, that he may go out and come in before them, doing Ju&s;tice and Judgment. The LORD make him truly the Defender of the Faith, a nur&s;ing Father to his Church &amp; People. The LORD pre&s;erve his Servant from all &s;ecret Attempts and open Violence. Cloath his Enemies with &s;hame; but upon him&s;elf let his Crown flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>AND may his Subjects be of one heart to Fear GOD and honour the KING. In his Days let the Righteous flouri&s;h, and abundance of Peace.</P>
<P>AND may the <HI>benign Influences</HI> of his Govern|ment <HI>reach his loyal People in the&s;e Ends of the Earth,</HI> come down upon us like Ram upon the mown Gra&s;s: as &s;howers that Water the Earth. May we al&s;o &s;it under His &s;hadow in the continued Enjoyment of our Privileges Civil &amp; Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, who have ever expre&s;s'd our Joy in the Pro&s;perity of his mo&s;t &s;erene Hou&s;e. LORD we look unto thee who ha&s;t the KING's Heart in thy Hand. <HI>Save Lord, and let the King hear us when we call.</HI></P>
<P>MAY the <HI>mo&s;t High</HI> choo&s;e our <HI>Changes</HI> in great Mercy, and give &s;uch from time to time to Rule
<PB N="24" REF="002957_0027_0FE6A5C788F18148">over us, as &s;hall be Ju&s;t, Ruling in the Fear of GOD: that under them we may lead quiet &amp; peaceable Lives in all godline&s;s &amp; hone&s;ty.

But <HI>look upon the face of thine Anointed,</HI> and &s;end now Pro&s;|perity, O LORD, for thy Names &s;ake, thy SON's &s;ake: O Shepherd of I&s;rael &s;hine forth, &s;tir up thy &s;trength, and come and Save us. <HI>Turn us again, O God of ho&s;ts, cau&s;e thy face to &s;hine, and we &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>IN a word, <HI>Let Civil Rulers realize their Mor|tality,</HI> and Act under this view that they mu&s;t &s;hort|ly be call'd to give up their Account to GOD the Judge of all. P&s;al. 82.6, 7. <HI>I have &s;aid, ye are gods &mdash; but ye &s;hall die like Men.</HI> Be entreated therefore to glorify that GOD in who&s;e Hand your Breath is, and who&s;e are all your ways.

<P>AND let us all be <HI>Exhorted to Accept of</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>as offer'd in the Go&s;pel, and to live in Obe|dience to his Laws;</HI> for HE is <HI>the Author of eternal Salvation to them that obey him.</HI> Heb. 5.9.
