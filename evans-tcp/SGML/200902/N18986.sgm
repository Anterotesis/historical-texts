<P>ON the fir&s;t Day of <HI>June,</HI> 1790, I took my Departure from the City of <HI>Rich|mond,</HI> with an Intention of vi&s;iting the We&s;|tern Regions of <HI>Kentuckey,</HI> and exploring the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions of <HI>Loui&s;iana</HI> and the two <HI>Floridas;</HI> as al&s;o the Territories of the <HI>Creek</HI> Nation, now under the Governance of <HI>Alex|ander M'Gillivray,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who from the con|current Approbation which he hath merited and received from the whole Nation, may, with Propriety, be &s;aid to hold imperial Pow|er, having many Kings and Princes &s;ubordi|nate to him.</P>

<P>Some Years &s;ince, the A&s;&s;embly of Virgi|nia voted a Premium to Mr. <HI>John Hobdy,</HI> for his Invention of a Machine, which he &s;ub|mitted to their In&s;pection, well calculated for the Purpo&s;es of beating out Wheat and other &s;mall Grain.

With this Mill alone, he &s;peedily prepares his Flax and Hemp for Mar|ket or the Di&s;taff.

<P N="30">30th. At 10 o'Clock di&s;covered the Wreck of one of Mr, <HI>Craig</HI>'s Tobacco Boats, which he had directed to be got under Way.

This Stone lies about 3 Miles above the <HI>Coweta,</HI> at the Rapids, covered over with hieroglyphic In&s;criptions, which the pre&s;ent Race do not under&s;tand. On the We&s;tern Side of the River, upon the low Grounds of the <HI>Cu&s;&s;atees</HI> is a Mount, on who&s;e Summit are the evident Traces of a Parapet &s;ufficiently large to have contained one Thou|&s;and Men. This Mount appears to have been the Work of Ages and of many Hands, being upwards of 600 Yards in Circumferrence at its Ba&s;e, and about 100 Feet in perpendicular Height. On the We&s;tern Side and imme|diately oppo&s;ite to the Mount, are the Ve&s;tiges of a very large and deep Intrenchment, thrown up in a circular Form by the Ance&s;tors of the pre&s;ent Race, as a Defence again&s;t a nume|rous Tribe of the <HI>Seminolies,</HI> whom the <HI>Creeks</HI> after a long and bloody Conte&s;t of 20 Years, extirminated, and re-peopled the de&s;erted Vil|lages by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow Emigrations from their own victorious Tribes.

<P>During my Tarriance at the lower Towns, I formed an Intimacy with the <HI>Little King</HI> of the <HI>Broken Arrow,</HI> who is friendly, commu|nicative and intelligent.

This little Reptile is about Fourteen Inches long, and about as thick as a Man's little Finger. It conceals it&s;elf in the Du&s;t, and makes its malignant Stroke on the unwary and un&s;u&s;pecting Pa&s;&s;enger, which is equally fatal with the Bite of the larger Rattle-Snake or Mocca&s;on, and requires as &s;peedy and powerful Antidotes to its baneful In|jections of &s;trong and deadly Poi&s;on.&mdash; Providentially for me, it made its Punc|ture on the Cuticle of my great Toe, at the Adhe&s;ion of the Nail, which prevented a general Diffu&s;&s;ion of the Poi&s;on into my Vi|tal Parts.</P>

to my Room, from the Indi&s;po&s;ition la&s;t mentioned. At Intervals of Ea&s;e, I could not refrain from &s;trolling through va|rious Parts of the City, which for its Size and Regularity is unequalled by any other in the Union, and probably not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by any in Europe, as to the latter. Her Mer|chants are very wealthy, and her Citizens in general, from their Indu&s;try and Frugality, rai&s;ed above the Frowns of Indigence, and many, though in humble, mode&s;t Garb, far above a Mediocrity of Fortune.</P>

<HEAD>The PREACHER.</HEAD>
<L>A Quaker Preacher, of the Pilgrim-Train:</L>
<L>An awful, rev'rend, and religious Man.</L>
<L>His Eyes deffu'd a venerable Grace,</L>
<L>And Charity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was in his Face.</L>
<L><PB N="102" REF="024705_0101_0FC82AF19273E080">Rich was his Soul, tho' his Attire was poor,</L>

<L>Refin'd him&s;elf to Soul, to curb the Sen&s;e,</L>
<L>And made almo&s;t a Sin of Ab&s;tinence.</L>
<L>Yet had his A&s;pect nothing of &s;evere.</L>

<L>He bore his great Commi&s;&s;ion in his Look:</L>
<L>But &s;weetly temper'd Awe and &s;often'd all he &s;poke.</L>
<L>From his &s;light Stock he had <HI>&s;omewhat</HI> to &s;pare,</L>

<L>And ever was at Hand without Reque&s;t,</L>

<L>Nor to reprove the Rich Offender fear'd;</L>
<L>His Preaching much, but more his Practice wrought,</L>
<L>(A living Sermon of the Truth he Taught.)</L>
<L>With what be beg'd, his Brethren he reliev'd,</L>
<L>And gave the Charities him&s;elf receiv'd:</L>
