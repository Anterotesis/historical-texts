<P>Let the word of Chri&s;t dwell in you richly in all wi&s;dom; teaching and admoni&s;hing one another in p&s;alms, hymns and &s;piritual &s;ongs, &s;inging with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</P></Q>

<P>_IN this chapter the Apo&s;tle exhorts the Colo&s;&s;ians to a variety of duties, to which they were &s;trongly obliged by virtue of their knowing and profe&s;&s;ing the go&s;pel. In particular; he enjoins it upon them to be heavenly-minded; to &s;eek tho&s;e things
<PB N="4" REF="011955_0003_0F8788E5D5AF73E0">
that are above; to mortify their members which are upon the earth; to &s;peak the truth one to another; to put off the old man with his deeds; to be clothed with bowels of mercies and charity;&mdash;to be peaceable and thankful.</P>
<P>AND in our text, in order to &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of any more particular in&s;truc|tions concerning their duty, he recom|mends it to them to become intimately acquainted with the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t: For if they were happily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this know|ledge, it would be unnece&s;&s;ary for him, or any other Apo&s;tle, to de&s;cend to a minuter detail of tho&s;e virtues, which their profe&s;&s;i|on of chri&s;tianity laid them under peculiar obligations to practi&s;e. The word of Chri&s;t would it&s;elf &s;ufficiently in&s;truct them in the&s;e things; and therefore he had nothing farther to do, than only to pre&s;s it upon them, to &s;tudy it with diligence and care, and make it familiar to their minds. Let the word of Chri&s;t dwell in you richly in all wi&s;dom, &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND as the Apo&s;tle was per&s;uaded that they would, by a careful and frequent peru&s;al of the Go&s;pel, di&s;cover a rich profu&s;ion of divine grace, a wonderful di&s;play of God's perfections in general, he would have them affect their hearts with a grateful &s;en&s;e thereof: And as there is no better way to
<PB N="5" REF="011955_0004_0F8788E75D4CBB80">
te&s;tify and expre&s;s thankfulne&s;s, than by &s;inging hymns of prai&s;e; therefore he exhorts them in the latter part of the ver&s;e, to teach and admoni&s;h one another in p&s;alms, hymns and &s;piritual &s;ongs, &s;inging with grace in their hearts to the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>SINGING</HI> is expre&s;&s;ive of thankfulne&s;s, as appears from the text, and from that parallel place of &s;cripture, Eph. 5.19. It al&s;o denotes joy and gladne&s;s, as is evident from that direction of St. James, Is any merry? let him &s;ing p&s;alms. It likewi&s;e indicates an hearty acquie&s;cence in the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence. La&s;tly, it is a particular way of wor&s;hipping God; of ble&s;&s;ing him for his favors, and prai&s;ing him for his unrivalled perfections. Hence it is a duty proper at all times, and &s;uited to all occa&s;ions. Accordingly, David declares that he would ble&s;s the Lord at all times, and that his prai&s;e &s;hould be continually in his mouth.</P>
<P><HI>SINGING</HI> was much practi&s;ed by the Jews of old. they had "&s;inging men and &s;inging women," per&s;ons particularly in|&s;tructed in mu&s;ick, appointed to lead in this part of divine &s;ervice. And that it might be performed with the greater variety and plea&s;ure, they introduced all kinds of
<PB N="6" REF="011955_0005_0F8788E803F248D0">
mu&s;ical in&s;truments into publick wor&s;hip; not to &s;uper&s;ede, but to be u&s;ed in concert with the human voice. The Jews doubt|le&s;s delighted in mu&s;ick, and <HI>this</HI> delight, together with its being a duty expre&s;&s;ly en|joined, was the rea&s;on why &s;uch ample provi&s;ion was made by them for its being regularly and decently conducted. And if the&s;e were rea&s;ons to <HI>them,</HI> why &s;hould they not be &s;o to us? It is a duty <HI>now</HI> as much as it was <HI>then,</HI> and we may pre&s;ume that it is in general as delightful to <HI>us</HI> as to <HI>them,</HI> to Chri&s;tians as to Jews.</P>
<P>THAT it is a duty under the go&s;pel none can que&s;tion, who con&s;ider that Chri&s;t, with his di&s;ciples early &s;et an example of it; and that his Apo&s;tles have &s;everal times warmly recommended the practice: And th&ocirc; no mention is made of <HI>organs</HI> or other <HI>mu&s;ical in&s;truments</HI> in the New-Te&s;tament, yet it cannot from thence be, with certainty, concluded that they would be either unlaw|ful or improper.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the idea that mankind generally have of &s;inging, it &s;eems to be more e&s;pecially adapted to joyful occa&s;ions. But as it denotes &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the events of Providence, be they what they will; as mu&s;ick has a mo&s;t happy tendency to poli&s;h and refine the &s;oul, to improve and perfect it in the virtues of the divine life; and,
<PB N="7" REF="011955_0006_0F8788EDC82EB618">
e&s;pecially, as there are tunes of different airs, &s;ome cheerful, others &s;olemn, fitted to joy|ful or mournful occa&s;ions; and as the apo&s;|tle a&s;&s;ures us in the text, that there is a vari|ety of &s;ubjects to be &s;et to mu&s;ick, (as ap|pears from his u&s;ing the &s;everal words, p&s;alms, hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs,) it mu&s;t be concluded that it is never un&s;ea&s;onable, and that it is a duty at all times to teach and admoni&s;h one another in p&s;alms, hymns, &amp;c.</P>
<P>EVEN &s;hould it be granted that &s;inging is expre&s;&s;ive of joy and thankfulne&s;s only, it would prove nothing again&s;t the con&s;tant fitne&s;s and propriety of the practice; be|cau&s;e we are required to "rejoice in the Lord alway, and always to give thanks for all things unto God in the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t." And were <HI>this</HI> not expre&s;&s;ly required; when can we be &s;aid to be &s;o far de&s;titute of favours, as to be under no obligation to ble&s;s God, and &s;ing prai&s;es to his Name? Under the mo&s;t afflictive circum&s;tances we are con&s;tantly &s;urrounded with a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings, for which we are bound to give thanks, and con&s;equently to engage in this delightful &s;ervice. Therefore if we con&s;ider the duty of &s;inging in this view only, it brings us to the &s;ame conclu&s;ion, and teaches us that it &s;hould be perpetual. Even that the Lord
<PB N="8" REF="011955_0007_0F8788EEE467CB30">
&s;uperintends all things, and is concerned in the government of the world, is matter of joy and gladne&s;s. "The Lord reigneth let the earth rejoice, let the multitude of the i&s;les be glad thereof."</P>
<P>OF this con&s;tant and delightful duty of our holy religion, I &s;hall now &s;ay &s;ome|thing more particular. And in my &s;ub&s;e|quent di&s;cour&s;e on this &s;ubject, &s;hall &s;peak of the two following things, viz.</P>
<P N="1">I. OF the nature, excellency and advan|tages of Church-mu&s;ick: And</P>
<P N="2">II. OF the manner in which it ought to be performed&mdash; with grace in our hearts to the Lord.</P>
<P>THAT &s;inging is a duty, and a part of in&s;tituted, publick wor&s;hip, none who be|lieve the divinity of the &s;criptures will pretend to deny: And that it was not made our duty without rea&s;on and de&s;ign, may appear form what follows.</P>
<P>MAN is the only creature on the earth that is endued with rea&s;on and a faculty of &s;peech. The&s;e &s;uperior powers are the gift of God; on him he depends for the continuance of them, and therefore in <HI>his</HI> &s;ervice and for his glory is he bound to employ them.&mdash;
<PB N="9" REF="011955_0008_0F8788EF8CFC47A0">
The glory of God is the principal end for which all creatures were made; and this they are capable of declaring in divers manners, according to their different na|tures and capacities. Even the inanimate world, the Sun, the Moon and the Stars in a &s;ilent, but expre&s;&s;ive manner, proclaim the glorious perfections, the wi&s;dom and &s;kill, the goodne&s;s and power of the divine Architect. The brutal creation &s;ub&s;erve the &s;ame de&s;ign, and in <HI>their way</HI> &s;hew forth the prai&s;es of him who made them. But then the&s;e &s;everal ranks of creatures are only the <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> in&s;truments of the divine glory. Man, as he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of rea&s;on and a faculty of &s;peech, is capable of being <HI>actively</HI> employed in this delightful and honorable &s;ervice; is capable of declaring articulately to all around him the glories of his heavenly King. For this end was his tongue given him, which therefore, in the p&s;alms, is &s;tiled his glory.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 16.9. al&s;o 108.1.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND &s;hall he &s;uffer <HI>&s;o</HI> noble, <HI>&s;o</HI> di&s;tin|gui&s;hed a faculty to lie dormant? Shall other creatures, both animate and inanimate, live up to the laws of their creation, declare the glory of God and &s;hew forth his handy work? And &s;hall man alone, tho' rai&s;ed high in the &s;cale of being, be &s;ilent in his Maker's prai&s;e? Shall man, tho' his organs are framed to make articulate &s;ounds, and
<PB N="10" REF="011955_0009_0F8788F05249BF58">
his rea&s;on &s;ufficient to enable him to pro|duce harmony, talk, notwith&s;tanding, the confu&s;ed language of bea&s;ts, and chant the di&s;cordant &s;ongs of birds? No. His im|provements &s;hould be eminent, as his pow|ers are &s;uperior. For harmony was he made, and in melodious notes &s;hould he &s;ign the prai&s;es of his God.</P>
<P>HARMONY con&s;i&s;ts in a continued coal|e&s;&s;ence of two, or more, &s;ounds, tho' at diffe|rent di&s;tances from each other; and the pro|per ingredients thereof, are concords. In the doctrine of concords, there is &s;omething ab&s;olutely unaccountable by man. Voices at &s;ome certain di&s;tances from each other, how plea&s;ant &s;oever in them&s;elves, will grate and jarr; whereas at other different di&s;tances (which are ea&s;ily a&s;certained by fixed rules) they will mix and unite, and, by their union, produce concords, from a continued combination of which, &s;prings harmony. Now why this is &s;o, we are unable to &s;ay; neither does there appear any natural aptitude in two &s;ounds of a concord to give a plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation more than in two of a di&s;cord; the&s;e different effects are by us in&s;crutable, and mu&s;t be re&s;olved wholly into the divine will. All that we can &s;ay is, that the&s;e things are in fact &s;o; and upon this well known, tho' unintelligible property of nature, the art of
<PB N="11" REF="011955_0010_0F8788F1C919B258">
mu&s;ick is founded&punc; the rules of which may be learned by per&s;ons of common capacities without any great expence of time or at|tention; and when learnt, may be reduced to practice by far the greater part of man|kind; and when practi&s;ed in that perfection the thing will admit, by a proper choice and mixture of male and female voices, con&s;titutes one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and advantageous exerci&s;es in the world.</P>
<P>CONCERNING the plea&s;ure of it, but little is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid: For they who have a ta&s;te for mu&s;ick know by experience its delight; whil&s;t others cannot form any better conception of it, than a blind man can of colours. Altho' harmony be found|ed in nature, &s;ome per&s;ons have their ears &s;o <HI>oddly</HI> con&s;tructed as to be incapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing between jarring and concor|dant &s;ounds; they are all alike to them, alike in&s;iped and indifferent. But they who have their auditory nerves rightly &s;trung receive the mo&s;t refined plea&s;ure from mu&s;ick; and when they hear a &s;elect number of &s;kilful voices, in concert joined, hymning the eternal Father, are tran&s;|ported with joy and filled with rapture. The clear and lofty notes of the Counter; the &s;oft, but full &s;ound of the Tenor; the &s;prightly and acute con&s;onance of the Treble; the manly, the &s;olemn and the
<PB N="12" REF="011955_0011_0F8788F29E8483E8">
grand echo of the Ba&s;s, all con&s;piring to|gether, and uniting in one charming &s;ym|phony, give the &s;oul &s;uch delight as is be|yond de&s;cription glorious! Such harmo|nious &s;ounds flatter our hopes, &s;often our cares, encrea&s;e our joy, inflame our love, di&s;pel our fears, and excite the &s;ofte&s;t pa&s;|&s;ions, the tendere&s;t emotions of the heart. I would not be under&s;tood to mean that the&s;e different effects are all produced by the &s;ame &s;trains of mu&s;ick. The power of &s;ounds is great, and the effects various ac|cording to the air, mea&s;ure and proportion of a tune, and the different keys on which it is con&s;tructed. There is the grave and the acute &s;ound; the joyous and the mournful, the &s;prightly and the &s;olemn mode; the flat and the &s;harp key, by a &s;uitable choice of which, almo&s;t any pa&s;|&s;ions and feelings may be excited. Some &s;trains of mu&s;ick will melt us into &s;oftne&s;s and enervate the &s;oul; whil&s;t others will rou&s;e us into manly courage and make us undaunted in the field of battle: Some will fill us with plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations; whil&s;t others &s;hall excite painful commotions in the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>SOUNDS have an immediate and power|ful influence on the nervous &s;y&s;tem; and, by giving the animal &s;pirits a bri&s;k or &s;low, an equable or un&s;teady motion, produce mirth or &s;orrow, hope or de&s;pair, rage or

di&s;traction. Accordingly hi&s;tory gives an account that di&s;ea&s;es have been cured, un|cha&s;tity corrected, &s;editions quelled, pa&s;&s;ions rai&s;ed or calmed, and even madne&s;s occa|&s;ioned by tunes of different airs. It is &s;toried that <HI>Timotheus</HI> could tran&s;port <HI>Alexander</HI> into rage and fury by the <HI>Phry|gian</HI> &s;ound, and &s;ooth him into indolence with the <HI>Lydian.</HI> And of a certain mu&s;ician in Italy it is &s;aid, that he was able, by va|rying his mu&s;ick from bri&s;k, to &s;olemn, and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> to move the &s;oul &s;o dif|ferently as to cau&s;e di&s;traction or madne&s;s.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the various effects that are produced by different compo&s;itions. Since therefore <HI>&s;inging</HI> is con&s;tituted a part of divine &s;ervice, it is always &s;uppo&s;ed that no tunes of a light and airy kind; none that are calculated to &s;en&s;ualize the mind and excite la&s;civious de&s;ires are introduced into the publick wor&s;hip; but only &s;uch as are &s;uited to mend the heart, to purify the &s;oul, to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s it of malignant pa&s;&s;ions, to &s;trengthen its faith, and rai&s;e its hopes to heaven.</P>
<P>OF this &s;ort of mu&s;ick would we be un|der&s;tood principally to &s;peak; and of the divine effects of it, what cannot be &s;aid! it is difficult if not impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay too much and to launch forth too far in it's commen|dation. Should we de&s;cribe it as capable
<PB N="14" REF="011955_0013_0F8788F40BC23930">
of working miracles, I am not certain the &s;cripture would not authorize the de&s;cripti|on. This mu&s;ick is an enemy to all malice, to impure imaginations and un-hallowed de&s;ires. <HI>This,</HI> and that grand adver&s;ary to the &s;ouls of men, the Devil, who walks about continually &s;eeking whom he may devour, are, luckily, no friends: They can|not dwell together. Sacred harmony which gives all pious &s;ouls the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible plea|&s;ure, fills that infernal and envious fiend with torture: &s;o that he had rather quit his de|lightful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mens bodies and minds, than undergo the torment of it. For the truth of this, witne&s;s king Saul, who, we are told, was troubled with an evil &s;pirit, and had it removed by the harmony of David's lyre. Whether by this evil &s;pirit we are to under&s;tand the Devil him&s;elf, or a &s;pirit of malice and rage which from time to time &s;eized the king, it matters not; for they are near akin, and what will remove one, will doubtle&s;s di&s;po&s;e&s;s the other.</P>
<P>PRAYER may, in a &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid to have an omnipotent power, as it prevails with the Almighty, and brings down ble&s;&s;ings from heaven to earth. But the efficacy of &s;acred harmony is nothing inferior. <HI>This,</HI> if it proceeds from a pious heart, makes delightful melody in the ears of Jehovah, and inclines him to look down from his
<PB N="15" REF="011955_0014_0F8788F4C5F208A0">
throne propitious to the &s;ons of men. <HI>This</HI> rai&s;es the &s;oul to heaven, and fills it with that peace of God which pa&s;&s;es all under|&s;tanding. <HI>This</HI> &s;preads a divine calm over the mind, hu&s;hes all tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions, and prepares us to receive, with reverence, in&s;truction from on high. <HI>This</HI> &s;ets all the &s;prings of nature to work, fires the &s;oul with divine love, and diffu&s;es joy and gladne&s;s through the heart.</P>
<P>ARE we at any time ca&s;t down, and filled with melancholly and di&s;ponding thoughts? by the power of mu&s;ick the gloom is di&s;pelled, and a ray of light darted into the mind, which cheers and enlivens it. Are our brea&s;ts torn with the pa&s;&s;ions of revenge, envy and malice? no &s;ooner do we hear the voice of melody, than the rage is &s;u&s;pended, and every baneful pa&s;&s;ion hangs its head. Is the &s;oul immer|&s;ed in the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e and voluptu|ou&s;ne&s;s? a &s;acred &s;ong &s;ung by &s;kilful and plea&s;ant voices will arou&s;e it from its lethargy, and make it ambitious of nobler and diviner joys. Is it carele&s;s about reli|gion and the things of futurity? when it hears the important truths of God, and another world chanted forth in melodious accents, and con&s;iders that in &s;uch raptu|rous &s;trains a whole eternity will be employ|ed by the ble&s;&s;ed inhabitants of heaven, it
<PB N="16" REF="011955_0015_0F8788F58E77D3B0">
is immediately excited to work out its &s;alvation with diligence and care, with fear and trembling, that &s;o it may be qua|lified for, and at la&s;t be made a partaker of the delights and honors of the upper and better world.</P>
<P>THUS &s;acred mu&s;ick is a friend to the &s;ocial and religious life; it advances our happine&s;s <HI>here</HI> and lays a foundation for the perfection of it <HI>hereafter.</HI> Doubtle&s;s the experience of many now pre&s;ent can witne&s;s the truth of the above a&s;&s;ertions. Have you not received numerous advanta|ges, as well as great plea&s;ure from clo&s;ely attending on this part of divine wor&s;hip, e&s;pecially &s;ince your late di&s;tingui&s;hed improvements in mu&s;ick? Are not &s;ome of you able to &s;ay, that from hearing an agreeable piece of &s;acred harmony, you have had your thoughts turned into a devout channel, and been led into &s;ome &s;uch &s;oliloquy as the following? If melody made by frail and imperfect men be &s;o ravi&s;hing, &s;o tran&s;porting, how charming mu&s;t that place be where God's prai&s;es will be &s;et to the harps of Angels, and ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and &s;hall join with &s;weet and &s;onorous voices to extol his unrivalled perfections? If we feel &s;uch plea&s;ing emotions of &s;oul at hearing the harmony of earth, how extatick, mu&s;t be
<PB N="17" REF="011955_0016_0F8788F748D08BC8">
our joy, when we hear the angelick choir attune their voices in their maker's prai&s;e, whil&s;t the innumerable band of the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect &s;hall join the cho|rus, and without di&s;cord &s;ing, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come: great and marve|lous are thy works, ju&s;t and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints; ble&s;&s;ing and honor and glory and power be unto him that &s;itteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever!"</P>
<P>IN a word; if the frequent hearing of church mu&s;ick, well performed, will not infallibly make a per&s;on religious, it will do much towards poli&s;hing his manners; and if to delight therein does not demon|&s;trate a man to be devout, yet it is for the mo&s;t part an evidence that there is nothing in his nature that inclines him to be flagrant|ly wicked. The lovers of harmony are &s;eldom known to be malicious and revenge|ful; but it has been &s;aid, and in &s;ome ca&s;es experience will ju&s;tify the a&s;&s;ertion, that they who have no ear for mu&s;ick, no reli&s;h for its charms, have dark and dread|ful &s;ouls, &s;trangely di&s;po&s;ed for trea&s;ons, ma&s;&s;acres, blood&s;hed and war.</P>

<P N="2">II. I AM in the &s;econd place to &s;how how this part of divine wor&s;hip is to be per|formed&mdash;<HI>&s;inging</HI> with <HI>grace</HI> in your hearts to the Lord.</P>
<P>NOW this expre&s;&s;ion (with <HI>grace in your hearts)</HI> may import the two following things, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THAT we &s;hould &s;ing gracefully, and in a manner acceptable to others; and 2dly, That we &s;hould &s;ing with grate|ful minds, with pious and devout affections.</P>
<P><HI>Some</HI> interpreters tell us that the greek words <HI>(en kariti)</HI> which are tran&s;lated, with grace, are equivalent to another greek word (viz. <HI>kaientoos)</HI> which is mo&s;t properly rendered, decently, acceptably;
<PB N="19" REF="011955_0018_0F8788FAD601D9A0">
or &s;o that our hymns may be grateful to others, and be received with &s;piritual delight. But whether the words are capa|ble of this con&s;truction; or whether <HI>this</HI> were the &s;en&s;e of the Apo&s;tle or not, evi|dent it is that tho&s;e who engage in and pretend to perform this part of divine &s;ervice, are obliged to u&s;e their be&s;t endea|vors to &s;ing in the mo&s;t regular and agree|able manner po&s;&s;ible. Though the tem|per of the heart be the thing that God principally regards in <HI>this,</HI> and all other religious exerci&s;es, yet it cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed to be <HI>altogether</HI> indifferent to him, whether we &s;ing by rule, or irregularly, in a graceful, or in a barbarous manner. God is not the author of confu&s;ion, but of peace, and he expects that <HI>all</HI> things &s;hould be done decently and in order, e&s;pecially in all the churches of the &s;aints. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 14.33 &amp; 40.</NOTE> As certain then as the great Jehovah is &s;elf-&s;atisfied, and plea&s;ed with his own perfections; &s;o certain is it that <HI>harmony</HI> is more acceptable to him than <HI>di&s;cord, regularity</HI> than <HI>confu&s;ion.</HI> Therefore they who perform church-mu&s;ick the mo&s;t by rule, and make the compleate&s;t melody with their voices, as well as in their hearts to the Lord, bid the <HI>faire&s;t</HI> to obtain his approbation and favor. As God is the author of nature, they who come neare&s;t

to <HI>her</HI> unerring &s;tandard, are advanced to the greate&s;t perfection, and mu&s;t certainly plea&s;e him the be&s;t. Since then harmony is produced by a clo&s;e attention to the laws of nature, tho&s;e who make the <HI>fine&s;t</HI> mu&s;ick are evidently mo&s;t ob&s;ervant of her rules, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be, in this re&s;pect, the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> acceptable to nature's God.</P>
<P>This being &s;o undeniably the ca&s;e, it is &s;omewhat wonderful that <HI>any</HI> per&s;ons, and &s;till more &s;urprizing that any who <HI>pretend</HI> to the lea&s;t &s;hare of rea&s;on and goodne&s;s, &s;hould &s;et them&s;elves to oppo&s;e the laudable endeavors of <HI>&s;uch</HI> as have of late attempted to make the &s;inging in our publick a&s;&s;em|blies regular; to retrieve the credit of our p&s;almody, and re&s;cue it from that barbari&s;m and uncouthne&s;s, that ridicule and con|tempt into which it had very unhappily, and almo&s;t univer&s;ally fallen. It is well if all &s;uch per&s;ons do not at la&s;t, to their &s;orrow, find that, in making &s;uch oppo&s;i|tion, they were <HI>fighting again&s;t God.</HI></P>
<P>As regular &s;inging is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing to the <HI>Diety,</HI> &s;o it is al&s;o to the <HI>greater</HI> part of mankind; to all who have their &s;en&s;es, as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, exerci&s;ed to di&s;|cern good and evil. Now as it is, in the general, the mo&s;t grateful to our fellow men, this &s;ugge&s;ts another very &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on why we &s;hould endeavour to &s;ing
<PB N="21" REF="011955_0020_0F8788FEB5561938">
by <HI>rule:</HI> For that mu&s;ick, which gives the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction, will probably produce the mo&s;t beneficial effects, in&s;pire the war|me&s;t gratitude to God for his favours, en|kindle in our hearts the divine&s;t love, excite the pure&s;t de&s;ires, and rai&s;e the &s;oul on contemplations wings to heaven.</P>
<P>THIS duty of <HI>&s;inging</HI> gratefully to others, implies the two following things.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THAT we &s;hould <HI>&s;elect</HI> out of that <HI>variety</HI> of tunes with which we are favored a few of the <HI>fine&s;t compo&s;itions;</HI> tho&s;e that contain the greate&s;t number of perfect con|cords, tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>air</HI> and <HI>time</HI> &s;hall be found to be mo&s;t plea&s;ing to a correct ear; who&s;e notes are properly adapted to the words, and who&s;e "&s;ound &s;hall &s;eem an echo to the &s;en&s;e." A neglect to u&s;e the &s;ound of the notes to the &s;en&s;e of the words which an&s;wer to them, is doubtle&s;s the greate&s;t deficiency in our Church mu&s;ick. Some &s;uperior compo&s;itions <HI>done</HI> by great ma&s;ters of &s;ong, are now in our hands. But is it not apparent that there is a gro&s;s failure in this regard? And does not this defect render our p&s;almody <HI>too</HI> unmean|ing a thing? An <HI>exact</HI> corre&s;pondency be|tween the &s;ound of the notes and the &s;en&s;e of the words that are &s;et again&s;t them; be|tween
<PB N="22" REF="011955_0021_0F8788FFD3DB9288">
the general <HI>air</HI> of a tune, and the nature of the &s;ubject-matter to be &s;ung, would give life and energy, beauty and force to the performance; and therefore in order to render &s;inging acceptable to others, the <HI>chori&s;ter</HI> would do well, always to adapt his tunes as much as po&s;&s;ible to the complexion of the p&s;alm: That is, for a penitential hymn, or p&s;alm of mournful contents, a tune con&s;tructed on the flat key, and of a grave and &s;olemn tone, &s;hould be given; whereas hymns of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving &s;hould be always &s;ung in tunes of a bri&s;k and &s;prightly air.</P>
<P>IT is as beautiful to &s;uit the tune to the nature of the p&s;alm, as it is to adapt the p&s;alm to the occa&s;ion, be it what it will. They who are the mo&s;t ob&s;ervant of this rule are the likelie&s;t both to plea&s;e, and to profit. Now to be able thus to accommo|date tunes to different &s;ubjects and occa|&s;ions, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the choir &s;hould be acquainted with, and have at command a con&s;iderable number of them; and this is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary upon <HI>another</HI> account, viz. to prevent a di&s;agreeable repetition. If the number of tunes which are &s;ung in publick be very &s;mall, they mu&s;t needs recur fre|quently; and if they are often &s;ung, their &s;ound will grow familiar, and if familiar it will pall upon the ear; and if it once
<PB N="23" REF="011955_0022_0F87890007DF4628">
grows dull, it will &s;oon be offen&s;ive and di&s;plea&s;ing. And all this may take place, not only with indifferent compo&s;itions; but al&s;o with the fine&s;t pieces of mu&s;ick. Such is the con&s;titution of man, that plea|&s;ure it&s;elf will not long plea&s;e: Much of our happine&s;s re&s;ults from variety; and novelty has its peculiar charms. New and &s;trange things do we love, and after them will we go. Now this pa&s;&s;ion for variety &s;hould be gratified in all ca&s;es where it can be done with &s;afety; and to plea&s;e it in the ca&s;e before us (in which certainly there can be no danger) it is of importance, not only to have the number to which we are at any time confined &s;omewhat large; but al&s;o to leave out old and introduce new tunes from time to time, as may be found to be nece&s;|&s;ary to avoid a dull identity, and to give to this part of divine &s;ervice all the charms of novelty. But then we &s;hould be always careful, that our humor for introducing new pieces of mu&s;ick does not exceed our capa|city for learning them, le&s;t, under a notion of making our p&s;almody more plea&s;ing by a variety of tunes, we really &s;poil it by our inability to &s;ing them.</P>
<P>WHICH brings me to &s;ay in the 2d place, that the duty of &s;inging gratefully to others, implies not only that we introduce the be&s;t mu&s;ical compo&s;itions into our churches, but
<PB N="24" REF="011955_0023_0F878900C8C7AE40">
al&s;o that we get a perfect knowledge of them, and are able to &s;ing them with all their graces.</P>
<P>THERE is not only a difference in the tunes, with which we are favored, but al&s;o a diver&s;ity in our manner of &s;inging them; and the excellency of the performance is the joint-re&s;ult of the <HI>Compo&s;ition,</HI> and the manner of its being &s;ung. An excellent tune but indifferently &s;ung &s;hall not appear &s;o agreeable, as an indifferent one regularly and gracefully performed. Hence then if we would &s;ing gratefully to others, we mu&s;t have re&s;pect both to the tunes in them&s;elves, and to the method of performing them. The apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> exhorts us to &s;ing not only with the &s;pirit, but with the under&s;tanding al&s;o, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 14.15.</NOTE> at lea&s;t he virtually injoins &s;uch a method of &s;inging; and the P&s;almi&s;t in &s;o many words requires all to &s;ing prai&s;es with un|der&s;tanding; or, as it might as properly be rendered, all that have under&s;tanding to &s;ing prai&s;es to God. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 47.7.</NOTE> To this purpo&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould teach and admo|ni&s;h one another, as we are directed in the text. In&s;truction in p&s;almody is as nece&s;&s;a|ry as in any other art or &s;cience. No man is born with the knowledge of mu&s;ick, tho' &s;ome per&s;ons have a genious particularly turned to make &s;urprizingly rapid improve|ments therein. It is in vain for us to pre|tend
<PB N="25" REF="011955_0024_0F87890193C94AD8">
that we need no other in&s;tructor than nature in this matter, and that it would be &s;ufficient for every man blindly to follow her uncultivated dictates: For be&s;ides that in this extemporaneous way, we &s;hould not hit upon ten notes out of a thou&s;and that would be melodious; be&s;ides that our hu|mors and fancies are different, which would inevitably lead us into different turns, trilloes and rolls in &s;inging, and draw us out into divers lengths of &s;ound: Be&s;ides the&s;e things, I &s;ay, not being acquainted with the &s;ame pieces of mu&s;ick, and not u&s;ed to &s;ing in concert, no harmony could be produced, but &s;uch a jarr and di&s;cord as would be ab&s;olutely intolerable to a nice and delicate ear. Such &s;inging, if it may be called by that name, would
<Q><L>"Rend with tremendous &s;ounds your ears a&s;under,</L>
<L>Like gun, drum, trumpet, blunderbu&s;s and thunder."</L></Q></P>
<P>HENCE the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of an acquaintance with the rules of mu&s;ick, and of a joint-knowledge of tho&s;e tunes that we pretend to introduce into our public a&s;&s;em|blies. Hence al&s;o the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inging-ma&s;ters to teach and in&s;truct the young, the ignorant and the unlearned.</P>
<P>TIME and money expended for this pur|po&s;e are profitably laid out. In&s;truction brings back the aged to the rule, from which
<PB N="26" REF="011955_0025_0F8789030BD13138">
they gradually, and in a cour&s;e of years widely depart; and enables the ri&s;ing gene|ration regularly to employ their tongues in their Maker's prai&s;e. How beautiful is it to &s;ee, under the benefit of kind and faith|ful Tutors, even children &s;kilfully u&s;ing their tongues in &s;inging loud Ho&s;annahs to the Son of David! Such an appearance brings to mind and &s;eems to be a fre&s;h con|firmation of this pa&s;&s;age in &s;acred writ, "out of the mouths of babes and &s;ucklings thou ha&s;t perfected prai&s;e." <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Math. 21.16.</NOTE> How much better is it for youth to &s;pend their lei&s;ure hours in learning &s;o plea&s;ant and profitable an art, than to pa&s;s them, as is too often done, "in rioting and drunkenne&s;s, in cham|bering and wantonne&s;s," to the di&s;grace of human nature, the de&s;truction of their cha|racters and e&s;tates, their health, and their &s;ouls. But</P>
<P N="2">IIdly. SINGING with grace in the heart, intends that we &s;hould &s;ing with pious and devout affections, with grateful minds full of the &s;en&s;e of the divine favours. This, in the &s;ight of heaven, is the principal thing; and to have our hearts rightly tuned, is, in a religious con&s;ideration, infinitely pre|ferable to the fine&s;t modulations of the voice. To what avail is it to have our tongues &s;ing in grateful accents, unle&s;s our &s;ouls
<PB N="27" REF="011955_0026_0F878904061A0300">
catch the &s;acred fire and glow in grati|tude to heaven. The melody of the heart is what the Apo&s;tle has &s;een fit particularly to recommend, as that which in the &s;ight of God is "of great price," and with which the melody of the voice is not wor|thy to be compared. The fir&s;t is the weightier matter of the law which ought always to be made, whil&s;t the latter &s;hould never be omitted.</P>
<P>IF we would make melody in our hearts to the Lord, we &s;hould endeavour to affect them with what we are employed about. Are we &s;inging a p&s;alm of prai&s;e and thank&s;|giving? we &s;hould be careful that our &s;ouls are filled with gratitude, and expanded with love to the &s;upreme Benefactor. Are we engaged in &s;inging tho&s;e p&s;alms which de&s;cribe the man after God's heart, and teach us what we ought to be? It will be the fixed re&s;olution of him who &s;ings de|voutly to comply with the&s;e demands and an&s;wer to this de&s;cription. Are we &s;inging a penitential hymn? Sadne&s;s &s;hould &s;et up|on our faces, and contrition po&s;&s;e&s;s our hearts. And &s;o in all other &s;uppo&s;eable ca&s;es. To &s;ing with grace in the heart, then, implies that the words of the &s;ong are re|ligious, as well as the notes of the tune har|monious; and that we diligently attend to, and under&s;tand the &s;en&s;e and meaning of
<PB N="28" REF="011955_0027_0F878904A167FC98">
the p&s;alm or hymn, or whatever it is we are &s;inging.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ervice we &s;hould have in view not &s;o much the prai&s;e of men, as the glory of God. We &s;hould &s;ing to the Lord, have re&s;pect in this as well as in every other part of wor&s;hip to his will, and to the honor of his name and religion. "Whatever we do in word or deed, we &s;hould do all in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, giving thanks to God and the Father, by him," as it follows in the ver&s;e immediately after the text. We &s;hould be &s;olicitous to plea&s;e him, and fear|ful le&s;t we offend him in the manner of di&s;charging this duty, knowing that the ac|ceptance of our prai&s;es is <HI>thro'</HI> him, and the recompen&s;e of them will finally be <HI>from</HI> him.</P>
<P>UNLESS the&s;e are our views and purpo|&s;es; unle&s;s this be the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of our hearts, tho' our &s;inging may plea&s;e and profit others, it can be of no la&s;ting &s;piritual benefit to our&s;elves; Our oblations will be offen&s;ive, and with all the mu&s;ick and harmony of our voices, we &s;hall be deemed by God, who &s;earches the hearts and weighs us in an even balance, as "&s;ounding bra&s;s and tinkling cymbals." Tho' in a &s;en&s;e we may be &s;aid to "offer prai&s;e, yet we &s;hall not glorify God," nor, in this way &s;hall we ever "&s;ee his &s;alvation." Harmony will not &s;upply the place of devo|tion,
<PB N="29" REF="011955_0028_0F8789054B0401E0">
neither will the correcte&s;t mu&s;ick, atone for the want of piety. Should we therefore be ever &s;o celebrated for our &s;u|perior attainments in this art, it will &s;ignify nothing if our hearts are di&s;cordant and not right in the &s;ight of God. It &s;eems to be the more nece&s;&s;ary to mention, and in&s;i&s;t on this, becau&s;e <HI>young</HI> per&s;ons are too prone to neglect their hearts, whil&s;t they are culti|vating their voices, and to &s;eek the prai&s;e of men, rather than that favor which com|eth of God only. But if the applau&s;e of men be the only thing they have in view, verily they &s;hall have their reward; they &s;hall receive the empty compliments and ful&s;ome panagyricks of their fellow-mortals and nothing el&s;e. To guard you again&s;t a mi&s;take &s;o pernicious, be per&s;uaded to carry your views forward and con&s;ider how ter|rible it mu&s;t needs be to go, at death, from prai&s;ing God on earth, to be a&s;&s;ociated with damned &s;pirits who &s;pend their hopele&s;s hours in bla&s;pheming that venerable Name which all &s;hould wor&s;hip and adore.</P>
<P>BUT if you are &s;incere in your devoti|ons to God <HI>now, then</HI> may you humbly hope to join, at la&s;t, with Angels round the throne in &s;inging anthems of prai&s;e and hallelujahs to God, and the Lamb that liveth and reigneth for ever and ever.

<P>A FEW reflections on what has been &s;aid &s;hall conclude the whole.</P>
<P>SINCE mu&s;ick is &s;o plea&s;ant an exerci&s;e, how thankful &s;hould we be to Almighty God, that he has con&s;tituted it a part of divine wor&s;hip; herein making our duty and plea&s;ure perfectly coincident: An evi|dence, among a thou&s;and others, that God is not a hard ma&s;ter, that he has con&s;ulted our happine&s;s in all his laws, and that he does not delight in the torment and mi&s;ery of his creature man. In token of our gra|titude to our &s;upreme Benefactor for his goodne&s;s in this regard, let us be excited to cultivate and improve our mu&s;ical talents, to "&s;tir up the gift that is within us," to teach and admoni&s;h one another in p&s;alms, and hymns, that &s;o we may make our tongues, in this way, in&s;truments of the divine glory. Some per&s;ons are &s;hamefully negligent, and therefore highly culpable in
<PB N="31" REF="011955_0030_0F878906CC9B6AC0">
this matter; they &s;uffer tho&s;e organs to ru&s;t away, which ought in all rea&s;on to be worn out in the immediate &s;ervice of their maker. Indeed there are a few who have no talents for mu&s;ick, neither <HI>ear</HI> nor <HI>voice;</HI> and who&s;e endeavors to learn the art, much more to excell in it, would be, of con&s;equence, to no purpo&s;e. Such per&s;ons mu&s;t content them&s;elves to &s;ing with the &s;pirit, and to make melody in their hearts only, as they are unable to do it with the under&s;tanding and the voice, always re|membring for their con&s;olation, that God requires of men only in proportion to what he has given them; and that, if there is fir&s;t a willing mind, it is accepted accor|ding to what a man has, and not according to what he has not. But they, who are furni&s;hed with mu&s;ical organs, and either do <HI>not</HI> improve them at all, or <HI>mi&s;improve</HI> them by &s;inging profane and vicious &s;ongs, are chargeable with guilt; "to <HI>them</HI> it is &s;in."</P>
<P>To the honor of many it may be &s;poken, that they &s;eem to have a ju&s;ter &s;en&s;e of their duty in this matter, and that, of late, they have been fired with a noble ambition to excel in this art: We rejoice to &s;ee that their endeavors have been crowned with abundant &s;ucce&s;s; and that, under the advantages of good In&s;tructors, they have,

in the compa&s;s of a few years pa&s;t, carried vocal mu&s;ick to a degree of perfection un|known in this part of the world till now. It mu&s;t needs give to all &s;incere lovers of harmony and Zion, great plea&s;ure to &s;ee this &s;pirit &s;preading from place to place; and particularly it is matter of heart felt joy to many that you, my young friends in this place, have imbibed &s;o large a propor|tion of it, and, under the au&s;pices of the mo&s;t high, have made &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed improvements in vocal mu&s;ick.

to be an objection in &s;ome mens minds; and if any part of it proceeds from pride, we are truly &s;orry for it; but if it proceeds from this, that the&s;e improvements render them unable to comply with what <HI>they</HI> &s;uppo&s;e is their duty, we &s;ay that probably they may have wrong notions of their duty in this in&s;tance.&mdash;It would be very agreeable to &s;ee the whole a&s;&s;embly join as one in prai&s;ing God for his common boun|ties; but this is a &s;ight we can never expect to &s;ee in this world; and were it po&s;&s;ible, it would not be worth purcha&s;ing at the expence of our p&s;almody. If our mu&s;ick has at any time got to a very low ebb, and cannot be reformed without leaving a part of the congregation behind, it is, notwith&s;tanding, a duty to attempt a reformation: For regular &s;inging mu&s;t be more acceptable both to God and man, th&ocirc; performed by only a part of the a&s;&s;embly, than that which is groveling and indifferent, th&ocirc; all &s;hould be engaged therein. Therefore if there be any who, through age, or other infirmity, are unable to keep pace with others in the nece&s;&s;ary improvements in mu&s;ick; in&s;tead of oppo|&s;ing them, they ought to attend on it with all the delight and profit po&s;&s;ible; remem|bring for their comfort that the benefit of &s;inging is not confined to who&s;e who per|form

it, but may extend to all who, th&ocirc; they cannot &s;ing with the under&s;tanding and voice, endeavor to make melody in their hearts to the Lord. If I mi&s;take not, the hearer has the advantage of the &s;inger in this re&s;pect; for the fir&s;t has nothing el&s;e to do, but to excite and cultivate his devotion; whereas the latter mu&s;t attend to the harmony of the voice, as well as to the melody of the heart. Let not any then, who are de&s;titute either of voice or &s;kill, imagine them&s;elves to be unconcerned in this part of divine wor&s;hip, but rather let them clo&s;ely attend to both the &s;ubject and the &s;ong, that they may &s;ing with the &s;pirit and make melody in their hearts to the Lord.</P>
<P>AGAIN, others there are, who, tho' they approve the mu&s;ick, object to the ceremo|nies with which it is preformed, and par|ticularly exclaim again&s;t the <HI>Pitch-Pipe,</HI> and the <HI>motion of the hand.</HI> With what pro|priety the&s;e are called ceremonies, I know not. There is certainly a wide difference between ceremonies &s;trictly &s;o called, and tho&s;e circum&s;tances which are nece&s;&s;ary ei|ther to the being or well-being of any particular performance, action or thing Ceremonies properly &s;o called ought never to be encouraged; becau&s;e it is well known they corrode the vitals of religion;

and that in proportion as <HI>they</HI> flouri&s;h, true and undefiled Chri&s;tianity withers and de|cays. But what is all this either to the Pitch-Pipe, or the Hand. The&s;e are &s;aid to be circum&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary to the decent and regular performance of vocal mu&s;ick: The one enables us to begin and &s;et the tune at a proper height or pitch, that &s;o the notes of it may be within the compa&s;s of different voices; and the other, to keep exact time and &s;ing in perfect con&s;onance. For want of &s;ome &s;uch expedients or helps as the&s;e, how often have we known the mo&s;t melodious compo&s;itions &s;poiled in the performance, and converted into <HI>har&s;h</HI> and grating di&s;&s;onance. Ina&s;much, there|fore, as the&s;e things give no di&s;turbance to the congregation, and are in &s;o great a degree nece&s;&s;ary to the beautiful and regu|lar di&s;charge of this duty, why &s;hould they be oppo&s;ed, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who e&s;teem regular &s;inging? To e&s;teem the one and find fault with the other is ju&s;t as con&s;i&s;tent, as it would be to extol a regu|lar face, and exclaim again&s;t tho&s;e features on which its beauty depends.</P>
<P>La&s;tly. OTHERS oppo&s;e the pre&s;ent regu|lar method of &s;inging becau&s;e they &s;ay it is an innovation, and an introductory &s;tep to Popery: Two charges, if true, that ought
<PB N="37" REF="011955_0036_0F87890CC4063278">
to determine all &s;erious and good men to oppo&s;e it. But there is no &s;ort of founda|tion for the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions. An innovation it is not, and to popery it cannot tend. Regular &s;inging is not a new practice even in this part of the world; for however the inhabitants fir&s;t began to &s;ing, we know a reformation once took place, which occa&s;ioned <HI>then</HI> as it does <HI>now,</HI> too much di&s;turbance. And as there is no foundation for the charge of innovation, &s;o it gives no occa&s;ion for that terrible outcry which &s;ome per&s;ons make, as tho' popery was advancing with haughty &s;trides upon us. This is the mear bugbear of folly, or the offspring of ignorance, or what is wor&s;e, the wicked craft of &s;ome de&s;igning men to bring this reformation into di&s;credit and &s;top the progre&s;s of it. For no per&s;on of common &s;en&s;e can &s;ee the lea&s;t connexion between popery and the late improvements in our church-mu&s;ick.</P>
<P>To conclude. IT is much to be lamented that chri&s;tianity is &s;o little under|&s;tood, and that the meek and conde&s;cen|ding &s;pirit of the go&s;pel is &s;o &s;eldom di&s;co|vered by tho&s;e who call them&s;elves the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. If &s;uper&s;tition, bigotry and ignorance were not &s;o prevalent, we
<PB N="38" REF="011955_0037_0F87890F96827B50">
&s;hould not &s;ee &s;uch fierce contentions about trifles to the neglect and detriment of the weighter matters of the Law. May toleration and charity be more uni|ver&s;ally practi&s;ed. "May we look not every one on his own things, but every one al&s;o on the things of others. May the ignorant be le&s;s prone to &s;peak evil of the things which they under&s;tand not, and may the &s;trong bear the infirmities of the weak."</P>
