<HEAD>AN Earne&s;t Addre&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>E&s;teemed</HI> FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR worthy Ance&s;tors, who&s;e names are held in religious Remembrance among&s;t us, for their labours of love and the hard&s;hips which they en|dured in their endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h the pure and genuine doctrines of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;et out with this one fundamental doctrine, That the Light in every man's brea&s;t was the true Light of Chri&s;t; and if duly attended to would lead us out of the errors, mi&s;takes and prejudices which had corrupted the religious principles of mankind in general, &s;o that we &s;hould no longer walk in darkne&s;s, nor follow the lying and deceitful Vanities of this World; but that we &s;hould be enabled by the divine principle of Grace and Truth to re&s;i&s;t the Temptations of the Devil, and to overcome tho&s;e fle&s;hly and worldly lu&s;ts which hold the people of this World in captivity to Sin.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="014019_0003_0F9286F6761C3410">THEY taught in the demon&s;tration of the Spirit and with power, that nothing was &s;o great an ob|&s;tacle to the growth of this divine Principle as in|&s;incerity and a di&s;regard to Truth, and they therefore exhorted all men in &s;inglene&s;s and &s;incerity of heart, to attend to the internal Teacher, and carefully to avoid every deviation from Truth or appearance of deceit&mdash;They &s;aw in the light of Divine Wi&s;dom the incon&s;i&s;tency of a Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion with every degree of cunning and guile, either in words or ac|tions. And their hone&s;t and upright te&s;timony in this re&s;pect expo&s;ed them frequently to the in&s;ults and moc|kery of wicked men. Indeed &s;o earne&s;t were the&s;e Moc|kers to catch them in &s;ome deviation from Truth, that they often a&s;ked them the mo&s;t &s;illy que&s;tions, trying if they could thereby en&s;nare them in their words; but they witne&s;s, that the Good Hand was with them, and pre&s;erved them from &s;peaking any thing contrary to Truth in their an&s;wers.&mdash;And,</P>
<P>THEY have left to all men a mo&s;t certain and &s;tanding evidence of their carefulne&s;s to avoid even the lea&s;t appearance of Untruth in many "forms of &s;ound words" now u&s;ed among us, whereby they avoided the po&s;&s;ibility of being found guilty of any fal&s;hood in their conver&s;ations, engagements or pro|mi&s;es; and were enabled to pre&s;erve the Te&s;timony of Truth clear and un&s;potted&mdash;</P>
<P>THUS by a &s;crupulous and con&s;cientious adhe|rence to the leadings of Truth in the minute&s;t things, our forefathers attained to a &s;trength and &s;tability in religion which enabled them to bear up again&s;t the many trials and &s;evere per&s;ecutions, which were &s;uffered to come upon them for the tri|al
<PB N="5" REF="014019_0004_0F9286F7312FDBA0">
of their faith, and the exaltation of the Truth which they profe&s;&s;ed&mdash;And by the openne&s;s, &s;ince|rity and &s;teadfa&s;tne&s;s of their conduct, they at la&s;t obtained this te&s;timony, even from their enemies, <HI>that they were an innocent, inoffen&s;ive and well meaning people.</HI> And tho' they were expo&s;ed to much in human and cruel treatment on account of their religious profe&s;|&s;ion, and in deri&s;ion were called <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet the Virtuous integrity of their lives, and their &s;trict and &s;imple adherence to Truth, by the ble&s;&s;ing of that God who dwells with the <HI>&s;ingle-hearted,</HI> and hates all hypocri&s;y and lies, enabled them to per&s;evere and to &s;upport their Te&s;timony, and at la&s;t procured them relief from almo&s;t every thing which the Pure Light in their minds could not &s;uffer them to &s;ub|mit to, or partake of.</P>
<P>I therefore felt a &s;trong inclination to lay this part of their conduct before you, that you might be e|nabled to &s;ee the &s;teps whereby our antient Friends attained a &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s in the Truth, and that having their example before our eyes, and &s;eeing the ble&s;&s;ing nd &s;ucce&s;s which attended them, we might be ex|cited to follow their foot&s;teps; e&s;pecially at this time of trial, which the Lord hath permitted to try our Faith, and to &s;hew who are his and who are not. &mdash;Suffer me then to &s;tir up the <HI>pure Mind</HI> in each of us by way of remembrance, to excite all &s;uch who are truly engaged in the work of an inward and &s;piritu|al reformation, to take care to pre&s;erve them&s;elves un|&s;potted, to be cautious not to &s;uffer their minds to be led a&s;tray on the one &s;ide or the other, and by all means to avoid the artifices and cunning of tho&s;e&punc; who, for&s;aking the divine leadings, &s;tudy to turn e|very di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence to the worldly ad|vantage

of the &s;ociety, by bowing to the wicked while in authority, and thereby wounding their own con&s;ciences, and in the end bringing di&s;honour on our te&s;timony and the principles which we profe&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing more certain both from the declarations of Scripture and the experience of Friends, e&s;pecially &s;uch as adhered &s;teadily to the Light of Grace in their own hearts, than that the duty of a truly &s;piritual man con&s;i&s;ts in declining to take part on either &s;ide in any political contention or quarrel, in con&s;tantly renouncing all worldly po|licy, and in patiently waiting for deliverance from the Lord&mdash;And &s;o far have the &s;piritually minded men of former ages been from appearing anxious to pre&s;erve the favour of tho&s;e in power, by any &s;eeming compliance with their arbitrary proceedings, that they have found it their duty to remon&s;trate again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ions, and to denounce the Vengeance of him who hates all inju&s;tice and cruelty again&s;t them, unle&s;s they repented&mdash;And the boldne&s;s and Chri|&s;tian plainne&s;s with which our worthy Ance&s;tors re|proved the oppre&s;&s;ors of their day, is &s;urely the &s;tronge&s;t proof of their integrity of heart.</P>
<P>THIS part of their behaviour, if duly attended to, will enable us to perceive the difference between them and &s;ome among&s;t us, who at pre&s;ent are high in profe&s;&s;ion; but who&s;e conduct and the lit|tle regard which they &s;hew to the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential prin|ciples of our Religion will, if approved by the &s;oci|ety, not only &s;ubject us to the ju&s;t cen&s;ure of the World, but render us entirely unworthy of that fa|vour with which the divine Goodne&s;s hath hitherto ble&s;&s;ed us.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014019_0006_0F9286F8AC5D77B8">THAT I may not be wanting in my duty, or ap|pear willing to condemn our leading Friends with|out advancing proofs of their guilt, I would not on|ly reque&s;t you to remember, that what the colonies contend for, <HI>is their right,</HI> and by Friends acknow|ledged to be &s;o, and then tell me, whether our la&s;t Yearly Meeting Epi&s;tle is not a mo&s;t &s;triking and &s;hameful deviation from that hone&s;t boldne&s;s and plainne&s;s of &s;peech which di&s;tingui&s;hed our ance&s;tors, and whether the &s;criptures of Truth, or the hi&s;tory of Friends can &s;hew &s;uch another te&s;timony again&s;t rulers who &s;eemed determined to carry their unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures into execution by <HI>fire</HI> and <HI>&s;word</HI>&mdash;A&s;k the Prophets of old in what lan|guage they &s;poke to the men in power when they acted unju&s;tly. Con&s;ult the fir&s;t founders of our &s;o|ciety, men who &s;pent their lives in e&s;tabli&s;hing the principles which we profe&s;s, and then declare whe|ther they &s;poke &s;uch language to tho&s;e in power.&mdash; If they did not, if they acted with a boldne&s;s at that time unknown, and, in the utmo&s;t plainne&s;s of &s;peech, denounced the Judgments of God again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion in their Rulers, and if their language was not &s;uch as the leading members of our &s;ociety &s;peak at this time, let us calmly con&s;ider which has the be&s;t title to that Divine Guidance and In&s;piration which makes the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed principle of our profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>MY appeal is to the hone&s;t hearted, who are wil|ling to examine their own conduct and the conduct of our leading men in the Light of divine Truth&mdash; To &s;uch alone I addre&s;s my&s;elf, and from them a|lone I expect a true and genuine reply&mdash;Whether did tho&s;e ancient Friends, among&s;t whom the wor|thy

founder of this province &s;tood foremo&s;t, who called upon the People to a&s;&s;ert their rights and a&s;|&s;ured them that then was the time; or our Meeting for Sufferings, who lately called upon our Elders to deal with every one of the &s;ociety who joined with the people to defend their rights, act under the in|fluence of the divine Spirit?&mdash;I firmly per&s;uade my&s;elf, that every ingenuous mind which regards the Te&s;timony of Truth, and attends to the Witne&s;s in his own heart, will readily determine to whom the preference is due&mdash;And an hone&s;t attention and obedience to that witne&s;s will always enable him to oppo&s;e that &s;pirit which is not of God&mdash;For if the Go&s;pel directs us to yield up a part of our right rather than to enter into contention about it, much more does it command us not to &s;trike hands with the oppre&s;&s;or. A righteous and ju&s;t man may <HI>defend</HI> his property; but he is a villain who either attempts unju&s;tly to deprive him of it, or abets the man who does.&mdash;</P>
<P>THIS Epi&s;tle when con&s;idered as a religious pub|lication, given forth by a people heretofore remark|able for their &s;teady oppo&s;ition to, and bearing te&s;|timony again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion in their rulers, is highly blamable, but when compared to the piece, intituled, "The Te&s;timony, &amp;c." it becomes innocent and laud|able. For what think ye my friends will the world &s;ay when they behold this Te&s;timony? with what indignation mu&s;t that Holy Spirit who&s;e leadings we profe&s;s to follow, view a publication, given forth as it were under the &s;anction of all the Friends in both provinces with a manife&s;t de&s;ign to ju&s;tify the oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures of government, and to brand with the wor&s;t of epithets, tho&s;e who&s;e greate&s;t fault
<PB N="9" REF="014019_0008_0F9286FA333B43D0">
is, that they contend for their right in a pacific manner?</P>
<P>THESE things have pained my heart, and filled my mind with &s;orrow and affliction, and I could not re&s;t until I had in &s;ome mea&s;ure pointed out their incon&s;i&s;tency with our profe&s;&s;ion, le&s;t you, who&s;e earne&s;t and continual waiting for the divine manife&s;tations may have prevented from attending to public affairs, &s;hould, thro' a confidence in the &s;incerity of tho&s;e who have given forth this te&s;timony, be induced to give your approbation thereto, and thereby bring a reproach upon Truth and the principles we profe&s;s to the world.</P>
<P>FOR there are &s;ome things a&s;&s;erted therein, which I fear will be a reproach to our &s;ociety as long as they remain upon record; becau&s;e they have &s;o &s;light a foundation in truth, that the whole conduct of Government and of the people is a proof of the contrary. I cannot therefore help looking forward with anxious di&s;tre&s;s, and viewing with angui&s;h of &s;pirit the Gulf into which they are about to plunge the &s;ociety by a ha&s;ty for&s;aking of the true path, and forgetting to wait upon the Guidance of that Spirit which alone can per&s;erve us from the &s;nares of the world and &s;upport us in the hour of Temptation.</P>
<P>WHILE men, who &s;eemed to be employed to &s;ow divi&s;ions among&s;t the people, and who openly appeared to pay no regard to truth, have for &s;ome months pa&s;t continued to condemn the pub|lic proceedings as &s;ubver&s;ive of all Government, and calculated to throw off all allegiance to the
<PB N="10" REF="014019_0009_0F9286FAF73EE608">
King, and to a&s;&s;ert that all our grievances might have been redre&s;&s;ed had we applied in a legal and con&s;titutional manner, I did not &s;uffer my mind to be troubled on account of their fal&s;hoods&mdash;I thought Truth could &s;uffer but little from men who paid no regard to a good Con&s;cience&mdash;And I knew the ju&s;t cau&s;e of the people would not be injured by their repre&s;entations; for Admini&s;tra|tion knowing them to be employed by them&s;elves, could not con&s;ider their declarations and a&s;&s;erti|ons as truths to be depended on; but only as means employed to &s;erve their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT when I beheld a People, who&s;e religious &s;tandard is truth and &s;incerity, incautiou&s;ly drawn in by tho&s;e, who call them&s;elves their repre&s;en|tatives, to a&s;&s;ert that,
<Q>From their pa&s;t experi|ence of the clemency of the King and his roy|al ance&s;tors they have grounds to hope and be|lieve, that decent and re&s;pectful addre&s;&s;es, from tho&s;e who are ve&s;ted with legal authority, re|pre&s;enting the prevailing di&s;&s;atisfactions and the cau&s;e of them, would avail towards obtain|ing relief, a&s;certaining and e&s;tabli&s;hing the ju&s;t rights of the people, and re&s;toring the public tranquility; and deeply lamenting that contrary modes of proceeding have been pur|&s;ued; which have involved the Colonies in Con|fu&s;ion, and appear likely to produce Violence and Blood&s;hed, and threaten the &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titutional government, and of that liberty of con&s;cience, for the enjoyment of which, our ance&s;tors were induced to encounter the manifold dangers and difficulties of cro&s;&s;ing the &s;eas, and &s;ettling in the Wilderne&s;s,</Q>&mdash;I
<PB N="11" REF="014019_0010_0F9286FBBA7B9E60">
felt an involuntary &s;igh ari&s;e within me, and I could not repre&s;s the emotions of my &s;pirit&mdash;</P>
<P>FOR would not any one, who did not know the true &s;tate of the proceedings of the colonies, up|on reading &s;uch a paragraph, extracted from the public Te&s;timony of the people called Quakers, imagine, that no attempt had ever been made by our a&s;&s;emblies to obtain a redre&s;s of our grievances; but that immediately upon our fir&s;t notice of their ex|i&s;tence we had broken out into the utmo&s;t violence and mo&s;t daring oppo&s;ition to Government&mdash;But let the following detail of facts &s;hew the inju&s;tice, not to &s;ay fal&s;hood, of &s;uch a repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the acts of parliament of which we complain were known in America, the A&s;&s;embly of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay &s;ent a decent re&s;pectful addre&s;s to the King, complaining of the infringe|ment of their rights, and praying for a redre&s;s; and to add the greater weight to their petition, they wrote circular Letters to all the other A&s;&s;em|blies on the continent, reque&s;ting them to join them in addre&s;&s;es to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THIS the A&s;&s;emblies of Rhode-I&s;land and Pro|vidence Plantations, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Lower Counties, and Virginia all joined them in&mdash;The other A&s;&s;emblies highly ap|proved the Mea&s;ure as well as tho&s;e who petition|ed, and only declined petitioning for the pre&s;ent until they knew the fate of the applications they had made by their agents before the arrival of the Circular Letter:&mdash;However, every A&s;&s;embly from Nova-Scotia to the Florida's petitioned
<PB N="12" REF="014019_0011_0F9286FCA7921C98">
&s;ome time after, as any one may &s;atisfy him&s;elf by con&s;ulting their proceedings for the Year 1768.</P>
<P>Now, here was a fair experiment made of that mode of application for redre&s;s, which our repre|&s;entatives (as they call them&s;elves) &s;o &s;trongly hint had never been tried, and of the &s;ucce&s;s of which, they appear &s;o confident, and wherein e|very A&s;&s;embly from Nova-Scotia to the Florida's united.&mdash;But what was the con&s;equence? Did the King pay any regard to their applications and addre&s;&s;es, tho' conceived in the mo&s;t decent and manly terms? No. The Mini&s;ter, (Hillsbo|rough) as &s;oon as he heard of the mea&s;ures which the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay A&s;&s;embly had taken, &s;ent a circular Letter to all the Governors of the other colonies, de&s;iring them to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to prevent their A&s;&s;emblies from join|ing with that of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, and con|demning their circular Letter as a mea&s;ure of a mo&s;t dangerous and factious tendency, calculated to inflame the minds of his Maje&s;ty's good &s;ub|jects in the colonies, to promote unwarrantable combinations, and to excite and encourage open oppo&s;ition to, and denial of the authority of Par|liament, and to &s;ubvert the true principles of the con&s;titution; and therefore he exhorted the &s;eve|ral Governors to exert their utmo&s;t influence to defeat this flagicious attempt to di&s;turb the pub|lic peace&mdash;And to add the greater weight and &s;o|lemnity to the&s;e proceedings of the Mini&s;try, and the more effectually to frighten the colonies into a tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and make them &s;ick of at|tempting to join in petitioning for redre&s;s of grievances, the Hou&s;e of Lords was employed to
<PB N="13" REF="014019_0012_0F9286FD3146DA58">
re&s;olve in the mo&s;t violent manner again&s;t their proceedings.&mdash;</P>
<P>SUCH a repre&s;entation of their conduct, and the mea&s;ures per&s;ued at home in con&s;equence thereof, alarmed our A&s;&s;emblies; and they, in ju&s;tification of their mea&s;ures, pa&s;&s;ed a few re&s;olves expre&s;|&s;ive of the innocency, prudence and con&s;titution|allity of their mea&s;ures, and a&s;&s;erting their right to join in petitioning his Maje&s;ty, denying the factious tendency of the Circular Letter and the Right of parliament to tax the colonies, and de|claring, That the Right of taxing the colonies remained in them&s;elves alone&mdash;This was all they did in oppo&s;ition to all the di&s;re&s;pect and contempt thrown upon their ju&s;t and mode&s;t applications to the Throne; yet this &s;o enraged the court of Great-Britain, that the mini&s;try &s;ent expre&s;s orders to the Governors of the re&s;pec|tive Colonies to di&s;&s;olve every A&s;&s;embly which refu&s;ed to re&s;cind the re&s;olves they entered into on the occa&s;ion.&mdash;Di&s;&s;olutions highly injurious to the colonies accordingly took place&mdash;and be|cau&s;e the mini&s;ter had committed &s;ome blunders, which &s;hewed his ignorance of the con&s;titution of &s;ome of the colonies, and expo&s;ed his political a|bilities, there &s;oon followed another letter from his Maje&s;ty, ordering the Governors to lay no more of the Mini&s;ters letters before our A&s;&s;em|blies; but only &s;uch parts as they &s;hould have his Maje&s;ty's expre&s;s commands for.&mdash;Thus are our A&s;&s;emblies for the future to be excluded from the knowledge of the true &s;ource of their calamities and the &s;pirit of the mini&s;try, except only &s;uch part of it as they may gue&s;s at from the
<PB N="14" REF="014019_0013_0F9286FF90717518">
conduct of their Governors&mdash;Nay the Mini|&s;ter was &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied with the conduct and pe|titions of our a&s;&s;emblies, as well as with the be|haviour of their agents, that he told one of the agents, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the colonies would never be well done until it came to be tran&s;acted by the Governor and Mini&s;ter only; and that he &s;aw no advantage in the A&s;&s;emblies having agents.&mdash; This I think needs no comment&mdash;for if that could take place, the complaints of the people would be for ever &s;hut out from the ear of the King.&mdash;In this &s;ituation of our affairs, had not our A&s;&s;emblies prudently dropped the matter, and left the people to take it up in the manner they &s;hould judge be&s;t, it is highly probable we mu&s;t, long 'ere now, either have &s;ubmitted to &s;lavery, or come to an open rupture.&mdash;</P>
<P>THIS treatment of our a&s;&s;emblies, and the &s;pi|rit of di&s;&s;olving them which then took place, and has continued ever &s;ince, as is evident from the di&s;&s;olution of the Virginia a&s;&s;embly la&s;t May, &amp;c. effectually put it out of their power to do any thing in their legi&s;lative capacity, and left us with|out any re&s;ource except in the &s;pirit of the Peo|ple&mdash;And &s;o &s;en&s;ible were friends, as well as all ranks of people at that time, of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of either &s;ubmitting to &s;lavery or exert|ing them&s;elves in &s;ome other way for our relief, that our Merchants, among&s;t whom are &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Friends, who but a few Months before refu&s;ed to enter into a Non-impor|tation agreement, now came into it with the great|e&s;t cheerfulne&s;s, and adhered to it with the utmo&s;t fidelity, as is evident from their conduct and pro|ceedings

<P>WHAT I have already related, I doubt not, has fully &s;atisfied you of the King's di&s;po&s;ition to hearken to American Petitions; but when I add to this, that the town of Bo&s;ton, at a legal meeting, mo&s;t earne&s;tly and humbly petitioned the King to grant them an opportunity of clearing them&s;elves from the unju&s;t repre&s;entations which they con|ceived their Governor (Bernard) had made of their conduct, by laying before them tho&s;e let|ters of his wherein they &s;tood accu&s;ed of riots and tumultuous meetings, and that this their ju&s;t and equitable reque&s;t met with a Fate which adds little honour to Government, or the Clemen|cy of the King, That their Governor was en|couraged to di&s;&s;olve their a&s;&s;emblies as often as they attempted to enter on the &s;ubject of their Grievances, by a&s;&s;urance from the mini&s;try, that he need not fear their withdrawing his &s;upport, for that he &s;hould be provided for&mdash;That this provi&s;ion has been actually made accordingly&mdash; When I call to your Minds, that their petition to have their late governor removed, for his having not only followed the &s;teps of his wicked prede|ce&s;&s;or, but even exceeded him, was treated with every indignity po&s;&s;ible to be &s;hewn upon the occa&s;ion, except being burned by the hand of the common Hang-man&mdash;and that every &s;peech from the throne, &s;ince the year 1768, which mentions America, breaths the &s;ame &s;pirit which prompt|ed the Mini&s;ter at that time to di&s;&s;olve our a&s;|&s;emblies for daring to petition the King, I

think it will put it beyond all doubt, that there was not, nor is to this day, the lea&s;t relief to be expected by America from the petitions of our repre&s;entatives.&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT that the King's di&s;po&s;ition to hear the pe|titions of his people may be more fully known to, and under&s;tood by you, I will lay a few facts before you which are not connected with our pre&s;ent di&s;pute.&mdash;The A&s;&s;embly of Virgi|nia petitioned to have a &s;top put to the impor|tation of Slaves from Africa, a matter which Friends as a &s;ociety, (and to their honour) have much at heart&mdash;their petition was rejected&mdash;and a number of re&s;pectable inhabitants in this City the next year applied to our Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, praying them to back the Virginia petition by one from our Hou&s;e; but our A&s;&s;embly declined it, giving for rea&s;on, that they knew it would not be regarded, and they did not think it prudent to bring the practice of petitioning into further contempt, by u&s;ing it when there was not the lea&s;t hope of &s;ucce&s;s:&mdash;Yet, that they might te&s;|tify their approbation of the mea&s;ure, they pa&s;|&s;ed an act laying an additional duty of Ten Pounds on every Negroe brought into the pro|vince for &s;ale&mdash;but this act met with the fate of the Virginia Petition&mdash;it was rejected by the Crown! The city of London petitioned, remon|&s;trated, and petitioned again on the affair of the Middle&s;ex election; but without &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;Fifteen Counties (in England) joined them; but they met with no better fate&mdash;The city of London pe|titioned again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ing of the Quebec bill; but to no purpo&s;e.&mdash;Whence then have tho&s;e,
<PB N="17" REF="014019_0016_0F928705714480C8">
who call them&s;elves our repre&s;entatives, their "pa&s;t experience" of the clemency of the King, and his readine&s;s to hear the petitions of his peo|ple? I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that no part of his public conduct affords any thing but the &s;tronge&s;t proof of his determination to hear none of the com|plaints of his people&mdash;but to treat them with contempt as often as they dared to offer them. I will not deny his Clemency to the two Kenne|dies, and to Balf and M'Quirk, the two Chair|men concerned in the riots at Brentford, who were tried for being pre&s;ent at and aiding in the murder of George Clarke&mdash;The evidence a|gain&s;t whom by all accounts was &s;hort, clear and po&s;&s;itive; they were therefore convicted and re|ceived &s;entence of Death&mdash; but his mo&s;t gracious Maje&s;ty re&s;pited them during his plea&s;ure, which I believe yet remains, and for no other rea&s;on that has ever been a&s;&s;igned, as far as I know, but becau&s;e they were then in the &s;ervice of the Mini&s;try&mdash;and a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in what they did to carry the election in that place.&mdash;</P>
<P>THESE being the facts from which his Ma|je&s;ty's clemency towards the colonies is to be e|e&s;timated, and this the only experience they could have had&mdash;I a&s;k, whether the paragraph which I have extracted from "the Te&s;timony" is true or fal&s;e? My dear friends, we are to an&s;wer to God and to the witne&s;s within us for every part of our conduct&mdash;let us then &s;eriou&s;ly bring this "Te&s;timony" to the Touch&s;tone, and try if we can approve it and be guiltle&s;s:&mdash;And if we cannot, let us not &s;hrink back with fear, but

tru&s;t in God, follow the Light in our hearts, and renounce all hypocri&s;y and lies.</P>
<P>IT may be ob&s;erved, that I have &s;aid, the te&s;ti|mony publi&s;hed by tho&s;e who "call them&s;elves our repre&s;entatives;" and it may be a&s;ked if they were not really the repre&s;entatives of our &s;ociety, and appointed for this particular purpo&s;e? It &s;eems to be in&s;inuated that they were. All I can &s;ay to it is, that I never heard of their being appointed for this purpo&s;e, or of their being the repre&s;enta|tives of our &s;ociety&mdash;but that they were only a &s;tanding committee of intelligence and advice for ordinary occa&s;ions&mdash;Our &s;ociety in the&s;e pro|vinces being repre&s;ented by our General Yearly Meeting, and by no other body of men.&mdash;I know of no law by which the&s;e meetings are e|&s;tabli&s;hed&mdash;yet I think them legal meetings, and &s;hould think it a high in&s;ult upon us, were they branded with &s;uch Names as the&s;e, Combi|nations, In&s;urrections, Con&s;piracies, and Illegal A&s;&s;emblies:&mdash;For as Francis Howgil, a man who was one of the greate&s;t Ornaments of our &s;ociety both for the Purity of his Life and Doc|trine, who&s;e &s;ermons will be admired as long as our chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion &s;hall remain, and who&s;e Title to divine In&s;piration few among&s;t us will que&s;tion, well ob&s;erves in his advice to the army, &amp;c. "It is not names, Titles, Denominations and Words, that can alter the Nature of Things. A Tyrant will call every Oppo&s;ition to his Will by the name of <HI>Trea&s;on and Rebellion;</HI> but," as the good man ju&s;tly remarks, "the Lord is &s;o far from accounting it &s;uch, that he is the very Means of rai&s;ing up that Oppo&s;ition and &s;upporting it

while it continues to with&s;tand arbitrary Power, and to aim at nothing but the Welfare and Free|dom of the People."</P>
<P>I WELL remember the &s;olemnity with which a worthy elder, late of the city of Burlington, at the time when this meeting for &s;ufferings was fir&s;t appointed and e&s;tabli&s;hed, expre&s;&s;ed his fear of the dangerous u&s;e which that meeting might make of their appointment, and mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly and weightily pre&s;&s;ed the Yearly Meeting to limit and re&s;trict their proceedings, expre&s;sly, to Matters of di&s;cipline and ca&s;es of &s;ufferings; and am well a&s;&s;ured it was never de&s;igned to meddle with po|litics&mdash;Happy had it been for the &s;ociety, had this meeting for &s;ufferings given due attention to the &s;imple, manly and forcible Chri&s;tian Coun|&s;el of a worthy member of it, who, during the debates on the pre&s;ent te&s;timony, advi&s;ed and en|treated that meeting "not to mix politics with religion," a&s;&s;erting, that they were "di&s;tinct and &s;eparate things."</P>
<P>HAD this te&s;timony been de&s;igned &s;imply for the purpo&s;e of clearing the &s;ociety of the odium which may be thrown upon us by the world, where was the Nece&s;&s;ity of branding the conduct of others with &s;uch opprobrious terms? Why has it been tran&s;lated into German, and handed thro' Lanca&s;ter County with &s;o much care? Does not this look as if we rather meant to blacken the proceedings of other people than to ju&s;tify our own conduct?</P>
<P>UPON what principles can the conduct of &s;ome

of the members of the meeting be accounted for? What obligation could there be upon any member of it to engage, to a &s;ervant of the Crown, that &s;omething of the kind of this te&s;timony &s;hould be publi&s;hed, and even allow him to a&s;&s;ure Gene|ral Gage that he might depend on its being done&mdash;And, immediately after the publica|tion of it, to hand a large number of them to that &s;ervant of the Crown to forward to the Ge|neral?

<HEADNOTE>
<P>The honourable Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, of the Pro|vince of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, in the Year <HI>1768,</HI> preferred an humble, dutiful and loyal petition to the King; of which the following is a copy.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>An humble petition to the King's mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Maje&s;ty's faithful &s;ubjects, the re|pre&s;entatives of your province of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts-Bay, with the warme&s;t &s;entiments of loy|alty, duty and affection, beg leave to approach the throne; and to lay at your Maje&s;ty's feet
<PB N="22" REF="014019_0021_0F9287092D56A8B0">
their humble &s;upplications in behalf of your di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects the people of the province.</P>
<P>Our ance&s;tors, the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this country, having with the royal con&s;ent, which we humbly apprehend involves the con&s;ent of the nation, and at their own great expence, migrated from the mother kingdom, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this land, at that time a wilderne&s;s, the right whereof they had purcha&s;ed for a valuable con&s;ideration, of the council e&s;tabli&s;hed at Plymouth, to whom it had been granted by your Maje&s;ty's royal predece&s;&s;or King James the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>From the principles of loyalty to their Sove|reign, which will ever warm the brea&s;t of a true &s;ubject though remote, they acknowledge their al|legiance to the Engli&s;h crown: and your Maje&s;ty will allow us with all humility to &s;ay, that they and their po&s;terity, even to this time, have afford|ed frequent and &s;ignal proofs of their zeal for the honour and &s;ervice of their Prince, and their firm attachment to the parent country.</P>
<P>With toil and fatigue, perhaps not to be con|ceived by their brethren and fellow-&s;ubjects at home, and with the con&s;tant peril of their lives, from a numerous, &s;avage and warlike race of men, they began their &s;ettlement, and GOD pro&s;pered them.</P>
<P>They obtained a charter from King Charles the fir&s;t; wherein his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to grant to them and their heirs and a&s;&s;igns forever, all the lands therein de&s;cribed, to hold of him and his royal &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in free and common &s;ocage; which we humbly conceive is as ab&s;olute an e&s;tate as the &s;ubject can hold under the crown. And in the &s;ame charter, were granted to them and their po&s;|terity,
<PB N="23" REF="014019_0022_0F92870A69A2BCB8">
all the rights, liberties, privileges and im|munities of natural &s;ubjects, born within the realm.</P>
<P>This charter they enjoyed, having as we mo&s;t humbly conceive punctually complied with all the conditions of it, till in an unhappy time it was vacated. But after the revolution, when King William and Queen Mary, of glorious and ble&s;&s;ed memory, were e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne; in that happy reign, when to the joy of the na|tion and its dependencies, the crown was &s;ettled in your Maje&s;ty's illu&s;trious family, the inhabitants of this province &s;hared in the common ble&s;&s;ing: Then they were indulged with another charter; in which their Maje&s;ties were plea&s;ed for them|&s;elves, their heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to grant and confirm to them as ample e&s;tate in the lands or territories as was granted by the former charter, together with other the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential rights and liberties contained therein; the principal of which, is that which your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects within the realm have ever held a mo&s;t &s;acred right, of be|ing taxed only by repre&s;entatives of their own free election.</P>
<P>Thus ble&s;&s;ed with the rights of Engli&s;hmen, through the indulgent &s;miles of heaven, and un|der the au&s;picious government of your Maje&s;ty and your royal predece&s;&s;ors, your people of this province have been happy and your Maje&s;ty has acquired a numerous increa&s;e of loyal &s;ubjects, a large extent of dominion, a new and inexhau|&s;tible &s;ource of commerce, wealth and glory.</P>
<P>With great &s;incerity, permit us to a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty that your &s;ubjects of this province, ever have and &s;till continue to acknowledge your Ma|je&s;ty's
<PB N="24" REF="014019_0023_0F92870AF7E36F20">
high court of parliament the &s;upreme le|gi&s;lative power of the whole empire. The &s;u|perintending authority of which is clearly admit|ted in all ca&s;es, that can con&s;i&s;t with the funda|mental rights of nature and the con&s;titution; to which your Maje&s;ty's happy &s;ubjects in all parts of your empire conceive they have a ju&s;t and e|quitable claim.</P>
<P>It is with the deepe&s;t concern that your hum|ble &s;uppliants would repre&s;ent to your Maje&s;ty, that your parliament, the rectitude of who&s;e in|tentions is never to be que&s;tioned, has thought proper to pa&s;s divers acts impo&s;ing taxes on your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in America, with the &s;ole and ex|pre&s;s purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue. If your Ma|je&s;ty's &s;ubjects here &s;hall be deprived of the ho|nour and privilege of voluntarily contributing their aid to your Maje&s;ty, in &s;upporting your go|vernment and authority in the province, and de|fending and &s;ecuring your rights and territories in America, which they have always hitherto done with the utmo&s;t chearfulne&s;s; if the&s;e acts of parliament &s;hall remain in force; and your Ma|je&s;ty's commons in Great-Britain &s;hall continue to exerci&s;e the power of granting the property of their fellow-&s;ubjects in this province, your peo|ple mu&s;t then regret their unhappy fate in having only the name left of free &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>With all humility we conceive, that a repre|&s;entation of your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in this pro|vince in the parliament, con&s;idering their local circum&s;tances, is utterly impracticable. Your Maje&s;ty has heretofore been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, to order your requi&s;itions to be laid before the re|pre&s;entatives of your people in the general a&s;&s;em|bly,
<PB N="25" REF="014019_0024_0F92870CEE8BD520">
who have never failed to afford the nece&s;&s;a|ry aid to the extent of their ability, and &s;ometimes beyond it; and it would be ever grievous to your Maje&s;ty's faithful &s;ubjects to be called upon in a|ny way that &s;hould appear to them to imply a di&s;tru&s;t of their mo&s;t ready and willing com|pliance.</P>
<P>Under the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ions of your Maje&s;ty's wi&s;e and paternal care for the remote&s;t of your faithful &s;ubjects, and in full dependance on the royal declarations in the charter of this province, we mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty to take our pre&s;ent unhappy circum&s;tances under your royal con&s;ideration, and afford us relief in &s;uch a manner as in your Maje&s;ty's great wi&s;dom and clemency &s;hall &s;eem meet.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, <DATE>Feb. 11, 1768.</DATE></DATELINE> <HI>To the Honourable the Speaker of the Honourable Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the province of&mdash;</HI>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of this pro|vince have taken into their &s;erious con&s;ide|ration, the great difficulties that mu&s;t accrue to them&s;elves and their con&s;tituents, by the opera|tion of the &s;everal acts of parliament impo&s;ing duties and taxes on the American colonies.</P>
<P>As it is a &s;ubject in which every colony is deeply intere&s;ted, they have no rea&s;on to doubt but your hou&s;e is duly impre&s;&s;ed with its impor|tance; and that &s;uch con&s;titutional mea&s;ures will
<PB N="26" REF="014019_0025_0F92870DAB9F7EE8">
be come into as are proper. It &s;eems to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that all po&s;&s;ible care &s;hould be taken that the repre&s;entations of the &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies, upon &s;o delicate a point, &s;hould harmonize with each other: The Hou&s;e therefore hope that this letter will be candidly con&s;idered in no other light than as expre&s;&s;ing a di&s;po&s;ition freely to communicate their mind to a &s;i&s;ter colony, upon a common concern, in the &s;ame manner as they would be glad to receive the &s;entiments of your or any other Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly on the continent.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e have humbly repre&s;ented to the mi|ni&s;try, their own &s;entiments: That his Maje&s;ty's high court of parliament is the &s;upreme legi&s;lative power over the whole empire: That in all free &s;tates the con&s;titution is fixed; and as the &s;upreme legi&s;lative derives its power and authority from the con&s;titution, it cannot over-leap the bounds of it, without de&s;troying its own foundation: That the con&s;titution a&s;certains and limits both &s;o|vereignty and allegiance; and therefore his Ma|je&s;ty's American &s;ubjects, who acknowledge them|&s;elves bound by the ties of allegiance, have an e|quitable claim to the full enjoyment of the fun|damental rules of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution: That it is an e&s;&s;ential unalterable right in nature, in|grafted into the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, as a funda|mental law, and ever held &s;acred and irrevocable by the &s;ubjects within the realm, that what a man hath hone&s;tly acquired, is ab&s;olutely his own, which he may freely give, but cannot be taken from him without his con&s;ent: That the Ameri|can &s;ubjects may therefore, exclu&s;ive of any con|&s;ideration of charter rights, with a decent firmne&s;s
<PB N="27" REF="014019_0026_0F9287111F225640">
adapted to the character of freemen and &s;ubjects, a&s;&s;ert this natural con&s;titutional right.</P>
<P>IT is moreover their humble opinion, which they expre&s;s with the greate&s;t deference to the wi&s;dom of the parliament; that the acts made there, impo&s;ing duties on the people of this pro|vince, with the &s;ole and expre&s;s purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue, are infringements of their natural and con&s;titutional rights; becau&s;e, as they are not re|pre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h parliament, his Maje&s;ty's commons in Britain, by tho&s;e acts, grant their property without their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e further are of opinion, that their con&s;tituents, con&s;idering their local circum&s;tances, cannot, by any po&s;&s;ibility, be repre&s;ented in the parliament; and that it will forever be im|practicable that they &s;hould be equally repre&s;ent|ed there, and con&s;equently not at all; being &s;e|perated by an ocean of a thou&s;and leagues: That his Maje&s;ty's royal predece&s;&s;ors, for this rea&s;on, were graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to form a &s;ubordinate le|gi&s;lative here, that their &s;ubjects might enjoy the unalienable right of a repre&s;entation. Al&s;o that con&s;idering the utter impracticability of their ever being fully and equally repre&s;ented in parliament, and the great expence that mu&s;t unavoidably at|tend even a partial repre&s;entation there, this Hou&s;e think, that a taxation of their con&s;tituents, even without their con&s;ent, grievous as it is, would be preferable to any repre&s;entation that could be admitted for them there.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e principles, and al&s;o con&s;idering that were the right in the parliament ever &s;o clear, yet for obvious rea&s;ons, it would be beyond the rule of equity, that their con&s;tituents &s;hould be taxed
<PB N="28" REF="014019_0027_0F9287126276CCB8">
on the manufactures of Great-Britain here, in addition to the duties they pay for them in En|gland, and other advantages ari&s;ing to Great-Bri|tain from the acts of trade; this Hou&s;e have preferred a humble, dutiful and loyal petition to our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign, and made &s;uch re|pre&s;entation to his Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters, as they apprehended would tend to obtain redre&s;s.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o &s;ubmitted to con&s;ideration, whe|ther any people can be &s;aid to enjoy any degree of freedom, if the crown, in addition to its un|doubted authority, in con&s;tituting a governor, &s;hould appoint him &s;uch a &s;tipend as it &s;hall judge proper, without the con&s;ent of the people, and at their expence; and whether, while the judges of the land, and other civil officers, hold not their commi&s;&s;ions during good behaviour, their having &s;alaries appointed for them by the crown, independent of the people, hath not a tendency to &s;ubvert the principles of equity, and endanger the happine&s;s and &s;ecurity of the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In addition to the&s;e mea&s;ures, the hou&s;e have wrote a letter to their agent Mr. DeBert, the &s;en|timents of which he is directed to lay before the mini&s;try; wherein they take notice of the hard|&s;hip of the act for preventing mutiny and de&s;er|tion, which requires the governor and council to provide enumerated articles for the King's march|ing troops, and the people to pay the expence: And al&s;o the commi&s;&s;ion of the gentlemen ap|pointed commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms to re&s;ide in America, which authori&s;es them to make as many appointments as they think fit, and to pay the appointees what &s;ums they plea&s;e, for who&s;e malconduct they are not accountable&mdash;From
<PB N="29" REF="014019_0028_0F92871308842530">
whence it may happen that officers of the crown may be multiplied to &s;uch a degree as to become dangerous to the liberty of the people, by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion which doth not appear to this Hou&s;e to derive any &s;uch advantages to trade, as many have been led to expect.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the &s;entiments and proceedings of this Hou&s;e; and as they have too much rea&s;on to believe that the enemies of the colonies have re|pre&s;ented them to his Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters and the parliament, as factious, di&s;loyal, and having a di&s;po&s;ition to make them&s;elves independent of the mother country, they have taken occa&s;ion, in the mo&s;t humble terms, to a&s;&s;ure his Maje&s;ty, and his mini&s;ters, that with regard to the people of this province, and as they doubt not of all the colonies, that the charge is unju&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>VIRGINIA, <DATE>May 9, 1768.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es of this colony proceeded, very &s;oon after they met, to the con&s;ideration of your important letter, of the 11th of February 1768, written in the name and by order of the Hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of your Province; and I have received their parti|cular directions to de&s;ire you to inform that ho|nourable Hou&s;e, that they applaud them for their attention to American Liberty, and that the &s;teps they have taken thereon, will convince them of their opinion of the fatal tendency of the acts of parliament complained of, and of their fixed re|&s;olution to concur with the other colonies in their application for redre&s;s.</P>
<P>After the mo&s;t deliberate con&s;ultation, they thought it their duty to repre&s;ent to the parliament of Great-Britain, That they are truly &s;en&s;ible of the happine&s;s and &s;ecurity they derive from the connexions with, and dependance on Great-Bri|tain, and are under the greate&s;t concern that any unlucky incident &s;hould interrupt that &s;alutary harmony, which they wi&s;h ever to &s;ub&s;i&s;t. They lament that the remotene&s;s of their &s;ituation often expo&s;es them to &s;uch mi&s;repre&s;entations, as are apt to involve them in cen&s;ures of di&s;loyalty to their Sovereign, and the want of a proper re&s;pect to the Briti&s;h parliament: whereas they have in|dulged them&s;elves in the agreeable per&s;ua&s;ion, that they ought to be con&s;idered as inferior to none of their fellow &s;ubjects in loyalty and affection.</P>
<P>That they do not affect an independency of their parent kingdom, the pro&s;perity of which
<PB N="31" REF="014019_0030_0F9287148DF73200">
they are bound to the utmo&s;t of their abilities to promote, but cheerfully acquie&s;ce in the authori|ty of parliament to make laws for pre&s;erving a nece&s;&s;ary dependance, and for regulating the trade of the colonies. Yet they cannot conceive, and humbly in&s;i&s;t, it is not e&s;&s;ential to &s;upport a pro|per relation between a mother country and colo|nies tran&s;planted from her, that &s;he &s;hould have a right to rai&s;e money from them without their con&s;ent, and pre&s;ume they do not a&s;pire to more than the natural rights of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, when they a&s;&s;ert, that no power on earth has a right to impo&s;e taxes on the people, or take the &s;malle&s;t portion of their property, without their con&s;ent, given by their Repre&s;entatives in Parliament. This has ever been con&s;idered as the chief pillar of the con&s;titution; without this &s;upport no man can be &s;aid to have the lea&s;t &s;hadow of liberty, &s;ince they can have no property in that, which another can by right take from them when he plea&s;es, without their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>That their ance&s;tors brought over with them intire, and tran&s;mitted to their de&s;cendants, the na|tural and con&s;titutional rights they had enjoyed in their native country; and the fir&s;t principles of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution were early engrafted into the con&s;titution of the colonies. Hence a legi&s;la|tive authority, ever e&s;&s;ential in all free &s;tates, was derived, and a&s;&s;imilated as nearly as might be to that in England; the executive power and the right of a&s;&s;enting or di&s;&s;enting to all laws re&s;erv|ed to the crown, and the privilege of choo&s;ing their own repre&s;entatives continued to the people, and confirmed to them by repeated and expre&s;s &s;tipulations. The government thus e&s;tabli&s;hed,
<PB N="32" REF="014019_0031_0F92871681DD14D0">
they enjoyed the fruits of their own labour with a &s;erenity which liberty only can impart. Upon pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions they applied to his Maje&s;ty for relief, and gratefully acknowledged they have fre|quently received it from their mother country: Whenever their a&s;&s;i&s;tance was nece&s;&s;ary, requi&s;iti|ons have con&s;tantly been made from the crown to the repre&s;entatives of the people, who have com|plied with them to the utmo&s;t extent of their a|bilities. The ample provi&s;ion made for the &s;up|port of the civil government, in the reign of King Charles the &s;econd, and at his reque&s;t, and the large &s;upplies voted during the la&s;t war, upon requi&s;itions from his Maje&s;ty and his royal grand|father, afford early and late in&s;tances of the di&s;po|&s;itions of the a&s;&s;emblies of this colony, and are &s;ufficient proofs that the parliament of Great-Bri|tain did not, till lately, a&s;&s;ume a power of impo&s;|ing taxes on the people for the purpo&s;es of rai&s;|ing a revenue.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that the Commons of Great-Britain have a right to impo&s;e internal taxes on the in|habitants of this continent, who are not and can|not be repre&s;ented, is in effect to bid them pre|pare for a &s;tate of &s;lavery. What mu&s;t be their &s;ituation &s;hould &s;uch a right be e&s;tabli&s;hed? The colonies have no con&s;titutional check on their libe|rality in giving away their money, cannot have an opportunity of explaining their grievances, or of pointing out the ea&s;ie&s;t method of taxation, for their doom will generally be determined be|fore they are acquainted that the &s;ubject has been agitated in parliament, and the commons bear no proportion of the taxes they lay upon them. The notion of a virtual repre&s;entation, which would
<PB N="33" REF="014019_0032_0F928718ADBDD2D8">
render all our rights merely ideal, has been &s;o often and &s;o clearly refuted, that nothing need be &s;aid on that head.</P>
<P>The oppre&s;&s;ive &s;tamp-act confe&s;&s;edly impo&s;ed internal taxes, and the late acts of parliament, giving and granting certain duties in the Briti&s;h colonies, plainly tend to the &s;ame point. Duties have been impo&s;ed to re&s;train the commerce of one part of the Empire that was likely to prove in|jurious to another, and by this means the welfare of the whole promoted; but duties impo&s;ed on &s;uch of the Briti&s;h exports as are nece&s;&s;aries of life, to be paid by the coloni&s;ts on importation, without any view to the intere&s;ts of commerce, but merely to rai&s;e a revenue, or in other words to compel the coloni&s;ts to part with their money again&s;t their inclinations, they conceive to be a tax internal to all intents and purpo&s;es. And can it be thought ju&s;t or rea&s;onable, re&s;tricted as they are in their trade, confined as they are in their ex|ports, obliged to purcha&s;e the&s;e very nece&s;&s;aries at the Briti&s;h market, that they &s;hould now be told they &s;hall not have them without paying a duty for them?</P>
<P>The act &s;u&s;pending the legi&s;lative power of New-York, they con&s;ider as &s;till more alarming to the colonies, tho' it has that &s;ingle province in view. If the parliament can compel them to furni&s;h a &s;ingle article to the troops &s;ent over, they may, by the &s;ame rule, oblige them to furni&s;h cloaths, arms, and every other nece&s;&s;ary, even the pay of the officers and &s;oldiers, a doctrine replete with every mi&s;chief, and utterly &s;ubver&s;ive of all that's dear and valuable: For what advantage can the people of the colonies derive from their
<PB N="34" REF="014019_0033_0F928718E150F610">
right of choo&s;ing their own repre&s;entatives, if tho&s;e repre&s;entatives when cho&s;en, not permitted to exerci&s;e their own judgments, were under a nece&s;&s;ity (on pain of being deprived of their legi&s;lative authority) of enforcing the mandates of a Briti&s;h parliament.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is a &s;ketch of their &s;entiments, as they are expre&s;&s;ed in a petition to his Maje&s;ty, a me|morial to the Right Honourable the Lords Spiri|tual and Temporal, and in a remon&s;trance to the Knights, Citizens and Burge&s;&s;es of Great-Britain in parliament a&s;&s;embled. In all the&s;e proceedings the council of this colony have concurred, and have directed their agent, James Abercromby, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to join Edward Montague, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the agent for this colony, in applying for redre&s;s of the grievances they &s;o ju&s;tly complain of. Copies were delivered to the pre&s;ident of the council, now commander in chief, who is de&s;ired to tran&s;|mit them to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate appointed by his Maje&s;ty to manage the affairs of North-Ame|rica, and Mr. Montague is enjoined to con&s;ult the agents of the other colonies, and to co-ope|rate with them in every mea&s;ure that &s;hall be thought nece&s;&s;ary to be taken on this critical point.</P>
<P>They tru&s;t they have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves with a firmne&s;s that becomes freemen pleading for e&s;|&s;ential rights, and with a decency that will take off every imputation of faction or di&s;loyalty. They repo&s;e entire confidence in his Maje&s;ty, who is ever attentive to the complaints of his &s;ubjects, and is ever ready to relieve their di&s;tre&s;s; and they are not without hopes that the colonies unit|ed in a decent and regular oppo&s;ition, may pre|vail on a new Hou&s;e of Commons to put a &s;top

<P>Sen&s;ible that the law you complain of, is a &s;ubject in which every colony is intere&s;ted, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives readily perceived the nece&s;&s;ity of an immediate application to the King, and that it &s;hould corre&s;pond with tho&s;e of the other colonies; but as they have not had an op|portunity of knowing the &s;entiments of any other colony, but that of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, they have endeavoured to conform them&s;elves to the mode adopted by you.</P>

<P>Your letter was laid before this Hou&s;e of re|pre&s;entatives early in the &s;e&s;&s;ion which is now ju&s;t clo&s;ed. They con&s;ider the &s;aid acts of parliament in their nature, tendency and operation, as matters of &s;erious concern and very intere&s;ting importance to this and all the Engli&s;h American colonies, and are of opinion that no con&s;titutional mea&s;ures proper for obtaining relief ought to be neglected by any, and that it is of importance their mea&s;ures for that end &s;hould harmonize with each other, as their &s;ucce&s;s may in a great degree depend on their union in &s;entiment and practice, on this critical and intere&s;ting occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e therefore very kindly accepted your
<PB N="39" REF="014019_0038_0F92871BED416360">
letter, and are per&s;uaded from the importance of the cau&s;e, the laudable zeal, and the generous exertions of the province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, from time to time, in favour of her con&s;ti|tutional freedom, that it proceeded only from a hearty concern for the ju&s;t rights, the common intere&s;t and welfare of the&s;e colonies.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e are de&s;irous ever to cultivate the &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hip and harmony with the neigh|bouring colonies, and with none more than your's, and will be always ready to receive with the ut|mo&s;t candour their opinion in any matters of ge|neral concern, and equally willing on all proper occa&s;ions to communicate their own &s;entiments on any &s;ubject of our common welfare, in full confi|dence they would meet with the &s;ame friendly and candid acceptance.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e have al&s;o taken into their &s;erious con&s;ideration the operation of the &s;aid acts of Parliament, and are deeply &s;en&s;ible that this, in common with her Si&s;ter Colonies, mu&s;t thereby be involved in great difficulties, which are perhaps a prelude to &s;till greater, and have pur&s;ued mea&s;ures for obtaining redre&s;s &s;imilar to tho&s;e adopted by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of your province.</P>

<P>The Hou&s;e adjourned on the 12th of April la&s;t, and have been &s;ince prorogued; and as the time of their exi&s;tence by law, will expire on the 18th of September next, I think that they will not meet again; but that they will be &s;peedily di&s;&s;olved, and writs be immediately i&s;&s;ued for the election of a new A&s;&s;embly; for which rea&s;on, I am a|fraid, I &s;hall not have an opportunity of laying your letter before the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e; but this, I hope, will not be attended with any inconvenience, as the &s;teps are already taken, which you have &s;o fully and warmly recommended.</P>

<HEAD>A genuine copy of a letter from a committee of mer|chants in Philadelphia, to the committee of mer|chants in London.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Philadelphia,</HI>
<DATE><HI>April</HI> 8, 1769,</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM your letters of the 4th and 26th of January, we ob&s;erve the attention you have paid to the memorial &s;ent you by the merchants and traders of this city, and the pains you have taken to obtain relief from the grievances therein complained of; for which we thank you.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer you received from the department to which you applied, &s;eems to afford little hopes of obtaining redre&s;s, in a way that will put an end to the unhappy difference that has ari&s;en be|tween Great-Britain and her American colonies.</P>
<P>We are told that the act impo&s;ing duties on gla&s;s, paper, &amp;c. "is inexpedient; but that &s;uch had been the unju&s;tifiable conduct of &s;ome in A|merica, that the admini&s;tration were of opinion the pre&s;ent juncture was not a proper &s;ea&s;on for a repeal."</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed that admini&s;tration would never err, or that tho&s;e affected by the errors of government would make known their complaints in a way the lea&s;t offen&s;ive; but as from the frail|ty of human nature neither is to be expected, it would become per&s;ons in power to con&s;ider whe|ther even the "unju&s;tifiable behaviour" of tho&s;e who think them&s;elves aggrieved will ju&s;tify a per|&s;everance in a mea&s;ure confe&s;&s;ed to be wrong. Certain it is that the wi&s;dom of government is better manife&s;ted, its honour and authority bet|ter maintained and &s;upported, by correcting the
<PB N="52" REF="014019_0051_0F92872A0A3D8178">
errors it may have committed, than by per&s;i&s;ting in them, and thereby ri&s;king the lo&s;s of the &s;ub|jects affections.</P>
<P>We are at a lo&s;s to know what behaviour the mini&s;ter refers to, or who tho&s;e are with who&s;e behaviour he is di&s;gu&s;ted. The Americans think that no people, who have any regard for liberty, could in their circum&s;tances &s;hew a more re&s;pect|ful behaviour. It is true, they cannot acquie&s;ce in the Parliament's claim to tax them; and con|&s;idering them&s;elves as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, who cannot of right be taxed but by their repre&s;entatives, and knowing that the lo&s;s of this privilege involves in it a lo&s;s of liberty, they conceive that earne&s;t and direct applications again&s;t acts of parliament, which de&s;troy it, not only ju&s;tifiable, but nece&s;&s;a|ry; and that their peaceable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch acts, till the re&s;ult of their applications is known, is the greate&s;t proof they can give of their affec|tion for their parent country, and re&s;pect for the parliament of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The admini&s;tration, it &s;eems, "are firmly re|&s;olved to oppo&s;e a repeal with their utmo&s;t &s;trength, while it &s;hall be in&s;i&s;ted on by threats from our &s;ide."&mdash;We are apprehen&s;ive that per|&s;ons in power were greatly abu&s;ed, and that the people of America have been gro&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ent|ed by &s;ome who wi&s;h well neither to Britain nor America; otherwi&s;e the &s;teps which they have ta|ken to obtain redre&s;s could never be looked on as threats. It is very unfortunate that the di&s;pute, which we fondly hoped was buried, and would have for ever lain dormant under the repeal of the Stamp-Act, is again revived by the late acts for rai&s;ing a revenue in America.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="014019_0052_0F92872A38BADF78">In a di&s;pute of &s;o important a nature, in which liberty is concerned, it is not to be wondered if free born Briti&s;h &s;ubjects are warmed, and if every ar|gument is urged that can have any weight to &s;e|cure to them a ble&s;&s;ing they &s;o highly prize. Threats they never intended, but as all the Ame|rican colonies were equally affected, it was thought that their joint petitions would have more weight; and for this end the &s;everal a&s;&s;em|blies communicated their &s;entiments to each o|ther: This &s;tep, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e of all America, is repre&s;ented by Lord Hili&s;borough in a late letter as a flagicious attempt, a mea&s;ure "of a mo&s;t dangerous and factious tendency, &amp;c." The di&s;&s;olution of a&s;&s;emblies that followed this letter, and the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued to inforce the Acts in America, awakened the fears, and ex|a&s;perated the minds of the people to a very great degree.</P>
<P>They therefore determined not only to defeat the intent of the Acts, by refraining from the u&s;e of tho&s;e articles on which duties were laid, but to put a &s;top to the importation of goods from Great-Britain. Heretofore they had almo&s;t en|tirely confined them&s;elves to the u&s;e of Briti&s;h manufactures, and from their affection to Great-Britain &s;hewed a fondne&s;s to imitate her fa&s;hions; but matters being now carried with &s;o high a hand, they tho't it improper and injudicious to indulge that humour. This is the only threat we know of, and if this is &s;ufficient to engage the mini&s;try to oppo&s;e a repeal of the acts, we apprehend the mini&s;try mu&s;t by a change of mea&s;ures endeavour to regain the affections of the
<PB N="54" REF="014019_0053_0F92872AEA5AE158">
people before they can be induced to alter their determination.</P>
<P>But we are told, that "if a proper di&s;po&s;ition appears in the colonies, and their merchants in a &s;ucceeding &s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hall think proper to petition parliament on the principle of inexpediency only, there was every rea&s;on to believe that no part of Admini&s;tration will object to the repeal." In a matter of &s;o great con&s;equence we &s;hould have been glad if the mini&s;ter had declared what "the proper di&s;po&s;ition" is which he expects from the colonies.</P>
<P>The Americans con&s;ider them&s;elves as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, entitled to all the rights and privileges of freemen. They think there can be no liberty without a &s;ecurity of property; and that there can be no property if any can, without their con|&s;ent, deprive them of the hard earned fruits of their labour.</P>
<P>They know that they have no choice in the e|lection of members of parliament, and from their &s;ituation never can have any. Every act of par|liament therefore that is made for ra&s;ing a reve|nue in America, is, in their opinion, a depriv|ing them of their property without their con&s;ent, and con&s;equently are inva&s;ions of their liberty.</P>
<P>If then the acts cannot be repealed while the mini&s;try objects, and if to remove the objections the Americans mu&s;t give up their &s;entiments, we mu&s;t candidly confe&s;s we have little hopes of a repeal ever taking place; much le&s;s it is to be ex|pected that the merchants will pre&s;ume to petition parliament on the principle of inexpediency only, when every a&s;&s;embly on the continent are apply|ing for a repeal on the principle of right. The
<PB N="55" REF="014019_0054_0F92872ED20F5E08">
merchants are too &s;en&s;ible how jealous the Ame|ricans are of their liberty ever to hazard &s;uch a &s;tep. We apprehend that advantage may have been taken from a &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;union of the colo|nies, and therefore think it our duty to inform you, that the merchants of this province have al|ways agreed with the other coloni&s;ts in opinion, "that the late revenue acts were uncon&s;titutional;" though they refu&s;ed to adopt a mea&s;ure which at one time they believed to be premature. They were &s;en&s;ible that mutual intere&s;t is the be&s;t ce|ment of nations; that by trade and commerce the union between Great-Britain and the colonies is be&s;t pre&s;erved. They knew that multitudes in Great-Britain would be &s;uffers by a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of trade with her; they were willing therefore to try what could be done by a memorial to their friends in England, who had &s;o generally, and to &s;o good purpo&s;e, interpo&s;ed before, and contri|buted &s;o much to the repeal of the &s;tamp act; but no &s;ooner were they apprized that no hope re|mained of a repeal in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, than they una|nimou&s;ly entered into the very agreement which &s;ome months before, when propo&s;ed to them, they had declined.</P>
<P>This agreement being formed on mature delibe|ration, we are of opinion the people of this pro|vince will firmly adhere to it. We are glad to hear the idea of rai&s;ing taxes in America begins among all ranks with you, of every party, to lo&s;e ground: Happy had it been for both countries if it had never been &s;tarted: However, if the acts complained of are repealed, and no other of the like nature are attempted hereafter, the pre|&s;ent unhappy jealou&s;ies will, we believe, quick|ly
<PB N="56" REF="014019_0055_0F928730C43B2CF8">
&s;ub&s;ide, and the people of both countries in a &s;hort time return to their u&s;ual good humour, confidence and affection.</P>
<P>As it is uncertain whether the parliament, if they &s;hould think proper to repeal the acts, lay|ing a duty on tea, paper, gla&s;s, &amp;c. imported into America, will directly enter into a con&s;idera|tion of our other grievances, we mu&s;t content our&s;elves for the pre&s;ent with bearing our te&s;ti|mony again&s;t the &s;everal regulations of which we complained in our memorial, and earne&s;tly reque&s;t you to u&s;e your endeavours to obtain re|dre&s;s of tho&s;e matters whenever you imagine there is a probability of &s;ucceeding. We are, Gen|tlemen,</P>
