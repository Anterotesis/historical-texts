<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_IT hath plea&s;ed the &s;overeign and gracious God, <HI>in who&s;e Hand our Times are,</HI> to or|dain that we &s;hould live under &s;ome peculiar Advan|tages for our precious Souls. For to the <HI>ordinary Means,</HI> we have &s;uper-added the Manife&s;tation of the Spirit, in <HI>extraordinary Works</HI> of Grace. We have lately heard glad Tidings from one Place &amp; another, that many are en|quiring the Way to Zion, with their Fa|ces thitherward; and &s;ome are decla|ring what God hath done for their Souls. Yea, God hath brought this Work home to our own Doors, &amp; we hear many cry|ing out, <HI>What mu&s;t we do to be &s;aved.</HI> And There are a Number hopefully rejoicing in God's Salvation. Of &s;uch a Sea&s;on as this it may well be &s;aid, <HI>I have heard thee in a Time accepted, and in the Day of Salva|tion have I &s;uccoured thee: behold, Now is the accepted Time; Behold, Now is the Day of Salvation,</HI> I hope God's People are
<PB N="ii" REF="004803_0002_100DF1DEFA4FC7B8">
reaping the Fruit of their Prayers, par|ticularly on extraordinary Days of Fa&s;t|ing ob&s;erv'd with an e&s;pecial View to this great Ble&s;&s;ing, the plentiful Effu&s;ion of the holy Spirit And &s;hall we not prize and improve this rich Gift? Shall we not redeem this precious Time in work|ing out our own Salvation? con&s;idering that God who alone can work in us to will and to do, &s;ays to us, <HI>Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call upon him while he is near. To Day, if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</HI> Certain|ly we mu&s;t be very criminal if we &s;leep or loiter away &s;uch a Day of Grace. They who are guilty of &s;uch a pre&s;ump|tuous Sin, run a dreadful Hazard of &s;wift De&s;truction, double Damnation. O there's great Rea&s;on to fear that another like Sea&s;on will never, never return up|on you. O Sleeper! Awake, &amp; hearken, there's a Noi&s;e, and a Shaking among the dry Bones. Some it may be of your own Acquaintance, &s;ecure like you a little while ago, are now in deep Con|cern, &amp; can no longer reli&s;h tho&s;e car|nal Plea&s;ures in which you were Com|panions. Now, De&s;truction from God is a Terror to them, and they are
<PB N="iii" REF="004803_0002_100DF1DEFA4FC7B8">
fleeing from the Wrath to come. What a Reproof doth God give to your Stu|pidity in the Awakenings of others? Now then hear God's Voice, <HI>Turn ye at my Reproof; behold, I will pour out my Spi|rit unto you.</HI> Or, if you are &s;till deaf to God's Calls, let the Thunder of tho&s;e amazing Words make your Ears to tin|gle; <HI>Becau&s;e I have called, and ye have refu&s;ed,&mdash; I al&s;o will laugh at your Cala|mity, and mock when your fear cometh. When your Fear cometh as De&s;olation, and your De|&s;truction as a Whirlwind.</HI> And tremble lea&s;t you &s;hould be &s;uddenly de&s;troy|ed, and that without Remedy. But then, Let awakened Sinners be en|couraged to pre&s;s into the Kingdom of Heaven. Strive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate; for many will &s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not be able. Improve the Five Talents now put into your Hands, re|membring what our Lord hath &s;aid, <HI>Un|to whom much is given, of him &s;hall much be required.</HI> O look diligently, le&s;t any Man fail of the Grace of God! Continue &s;eeking till Chri&s;t be revealed to you as the Lord your Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and as the God of Judgment: That you may glory in this, that you under&s;tand, &amp; know the
<PB N="iv" REF="004803_0003_100DF1E19B6970D8">
Lord, who exerci&s;eth Loving-kindne&s;s, Judgment &amp; Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the Earth. And here, among you with whom the Spirit is &s;triving at this Day, we behold many of our young People. O our Chil|dren! God is drawing nigh to you in a di&s;tingui&s;hing manner, and will not you from this Time cry unto him <HI>My Father, thou art the Guide of my Youth?</HI> Shall any of you be pro&s;ane as <HI>E&s;au,</HI> who for one Mor&s;el of Meat &s;old his Birth-right; and then, when he would have inheri|ted the Ble&s;&s;ing, was rejected? God for|bid. May you all thir&s;t for God, and &s;eek him early, till that Promi&s;e &s;hall be more abundantly fulfilled in you, <HI>I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed and my Ble&s;&s;ing on thine Offspring.</HI> And is it po&s;&s;ible for Parents &amp; elder Per&s;ons to behold the&s;e Things, and not be moved? Can you &s;ee your Children in Pain, and travailing till Chri&s;t be formed in them, and you be unconcern'd about the New-Birth? Are they taken, and can you bear to be left behind; left to peri&s;h in your Sins, as far di&s;tant as Heaven &amp; Hell? Is the eleventh Hour running, and you not effectually called? What a &s;ad Token is this! The Lord have Mercy upon you!
<PB N="v" REF="004803_0003_100DF1E19B6970D8">
But there are con&s;iderable Numbers of elder as well as younger Per&s;ons, of whom I am per&s;waded better Things, and Things that accompany Salva|tion. And to you our a&s;cended Sa|viour &s;peaks, <HI>Hold fa&s;t till I come.</HI> Be not a&s;hamed or afraid, to confe&s;s Chri&s;t before Men; &amp; to &s;tand up for him. And here the Providence of God gives me Advantage to pre&s;s upon you that Ex|hortation; If ye are ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, <HI>&s;eek tho&s;e Things which are above;</HI> &s;et your Affection on things above, not on things on the Earth. For as it was with God's ancient People, <HI>a Day of Darkne&s;s and Gloomine&s;s,</HI> and then God comforted his People with that gracious Promi&s;e, <HI>I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fle&s;h.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joel 2</NOTE> So it plea&s;eth God to &s;end down the Com|forter from Heaven into the Hearts of his People, while it is a dark Day with us upon temporal Accounts. May the Spirit of Judgment &s;anctify the Frowns of God upon us to rebuke our Pride, our Covetou&s;ne&s;s, our Luxury; and all tho&s;e fooli&s;h and hurtful Lu&s;ts, whereby we have been conformed to this World. And now we be|hold, the Cur&s;e devouring the Earth,
<PB N="vi" REF="004803_0004_100DF1E337D08360">
may we all unite in &s;eeking the Ble&s;&s;ings of the heavenly Paradi&s;e, where Satan &amp; the Cur&s;e can never enter. That we may even now &s;ay with the Prophet, <HI>Altho' the Fig-Tree &s;hall not blo&s;&s;om&mdash;and the Fields &s;hall yield no Meat, the Flock &s;hall be cut off from the Fold, and there &s;hall be no Herd in the Stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>But I forbear, and would only further &s;ay, that the remarkable Work of Grace begun and going on among us, gave Encouragement to me to &s;tudy and preach the following Sermons. At fir&s;t, I de&s;ign'd to publi&s;h only upon the Head of Conviction of Sin, the Di&s;|cour&s;es upon which Subject it plea&s;ed God to own and ble&s;s much beyond my Expectation. May the Prai&s;e be given to that God who hath cho&s;en the weak Things of the World, that no Fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his Pre&s;ence. Since that, I have been prevail'd upon to go on with the Subject, and al&s;o to publi&s;h the other Di&s;cour&s;es; that we may &s;ee in &s;ome mea&s;ure how the Spirit of God carrieth on his good Work in the Hearts of his People from legal Conviction to &s;aving Conver&s;ion, and then &s;ends forth Judgment to Victory, not withs|tanding all Oppo&s;ition from the Enemies of our Salvation. Sen&s;ible of the Defects which attend this Performance, I humbly commend it to God for His Ble&s;&s;ing, be&s;eeching him to teach us to Profit by all the Means of Grace which he gives us richly to enjoy.</P>

<P>_IN my la&s;t Turn at this Lec|ture, I con&s;ider'd our Lord JESUS CHRIST as <HI>exalted to be a Prince, and a Savi|our, to give Repentance to I&s;rael and Forgivene&s;s of Sins;</HI> from Acts 5.31. I now proceed to &s;hew you the great and comprehen&s;ive Gift which our
<PB N="2" REF="004803_0005_100DF1E4D61D7FC0">
Lord receiv'd of the Father, when he a&s;cen|ded on high, the Gift of the HOLY SPIRIT, by whom He works Faith and Repentance in the Hearts of his People, and &s;o prepa|reth them for all the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;|pel. And here our Lord a&s;&s;ureth us that hi&s; Di&s;ciples, and &s;o his Churches would be great Gainers by his withdraw from them on Earth, to his exalted State in Heaven; for then, and not till then, &s;hould the Spirit be given in a more plentiful and exten&s;ive manner, in virtue of CHRIST'S Interce&s;&s;ion at the Father's Right Hand; and that to make Application of the Redemption purchas'd by Him, and to communicate all &s;piritual Ble&s;|&s;ings to his People, <HI>Ver. 7 Neverthele&s;s, I tell you the Truth, It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will &s;end him into you.</HI> Accor|dingly we al&s;o read, that the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t was not yet given, becau&s;e that Je&s;us was not, yet glorified.</HI> And we have the fulfilment of our Saviours Promi&s;e, Acts 2.4. v. <HI>They were all filled with the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> in mira|culous Gifts, particularly the Gift of Tongues, whereby the Apo&s;tle, were qualified to preach the Go&s;pel to other Nations. And the Spi|rit of GOD was al&s;o pour'd out in an ex|traordinary manner as a Spirit of Grace and Con&s;olation, 41, 42, v. <HI>Then they that gladly
<PB N="3" REF="004803_0005_100DF1E4D61D7FC0">
received his Word were baptized: and the &s;ame Day there were added unto them about three thou&s;and Souls. And they continued &s;ted|fa&s;tly in the Apo&s;tles Doctrine and Fellow&s;hip, and in breaking of Bread and in Prayers.</HI> But I return to the Text, in which we have the Errand on which the Holy Gho&s;t is &s;ent, and the Work he &s;hould perform in virtue of his Mi&s;&s;ion, de&s;cribed. For tho' the Three Per&s;ons in the adorable Trinity are <HI>One</HI> in the e&s;&s;ential Perfections of the divine Nature, yet in the Covenant of Redemption, the Son voluntarily agreeth to fulfill the Father's Will by taking our Nature in the fulne&s;s of Time, and purcha&s;ing eternal Salva|tion for his People; and the Holy Spirit en|gageth that the &s;aving Benefits of this Re|demption &s;hall be applied to all whom the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath cho&s;en in him before the Foundation of the World, that they &s;hould be holy, and without blame before him in love. Agre|ably it is here &s;aid, And when he is come, he will reprove, <HI>&amp;c. When he is come,</HI> i. e. In the peculiar Manife&s;tations of his gracious Pre&s;ence; for in his divine E&s;&s;ence, the Spirit is immen&s;e and omnipre&s;ent. <HI>Whither &s;hall I go from thy Spirit,</HI> P&s;al. 139.7. <HI>He will reprove the World of Sin,</HI>&mdash;Not only Jews but Gentiles. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome may be &s;tumbled that the Spirit is call'd the Comforter, and
<PB N="4" REF="004803_0006_100DF1E69548DA40">
then it is &s;aid that he &s;hould Reprove. But now, the Word is of a larger Signification, it &s;ignifieth <HI>Advocate,</HI> and is thus tran&s;lated by <HI>Beza.</HI> We have the &s;ame Word appli|ed to Chri&s;t, 1 Joh. 2.1. And accordingly, the Spirit is call'd <HI>another Comforter</HI> or Ad|vocate, Joh. 14.16. When our Lord a&s;cended to appear in the Pre&s;ence of God for his People, and tran&s;act their Affairs in the Court of Heaven as their Advocate with the Father; He &s;ent his holy Spirit to ma|nage the Affairs of the Kingdom of Grace here upon Earth. And this Work of con|vincing Men of Sin well &s;uits with this Cha|racter of an Advocate. As &s;uch the Spirit of God &s;hews Sinners that the Charge laid again&s;t them in God's Word is ju&s;t, that the World may become guilty before God and that Sinners &s;elf-condemned may &s;eek Ju&s;tification by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;o be prepared for the Joy of God's Salvation. And this agreeth al&s;o with the Word here tran&s;lated <HI>Reprove,</HI> which &s;ignifieth to convince by evident Argument and &s;olid Rea&s;on. "I will convince them of their Sins, and after reprove, admoni&s;h and check them for the &s;ame" And there's then a particular Sin mentioned, Cont. v. 9 <HI>Of Sin, becau&s;e they believe not in me.</HI> The hainous Sin of the <HI>Jews</HI> in that Day was that they rejected Je&s;us Chri&s;t the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="004803_0006_100DF1E69548DA40">
promi&s;ed to their Fathers and &s;ent to them as the only Name whereby they could be &s;aved. <HI>He came unto his own, and his own received him not, Joh. 1.11.</HI> Saving a Rem|nant according to the Election of Grace. <HI>Becau&s;e of unbelief, they were broken off,</HI> Rom. 11.20. Accordingly when the Spirit of God was poured out and <HI>Peter</HI> preached to them, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. He charg'd them home with the great Sin of rejecting and crucifying the Lord of Glory; upon which many are pricked to the Heart, and &s;ay in deep Con|cern, <HI>Men and Brethren, What &s;hall we do?</HI> 37. v. And doth not this Sin of Unbelief much prevail in this Age? Many &s;eem to be in&s;en&s;ible how great the Evil of this Sin is, tho' the Word of God declareth, that <HI>He who believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becau&s;e he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son,</HI> 1 Joh 5.10. It's to be fear'd that there are many under the Go&s;pel, who &s;atisfy them&s;elves with an out|ward Attendance on religious Duties, while they refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to Chri&s;t, and neg|lect his great Salvation. But now, when the Spirit of God convinceth Men of Sin, He will &s;hew them the great Evil of an Heart of Unbelief, and make them &s;en&s;ible of this, that <HI>he who believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee Life; but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> Again, The Spirit reproveth of
<PB N="6" REF="004803_0007_100DF1E8AF007498">
<HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> He will convince Men that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> who &s;uffered an accur&s;ed Death as if he had been the vile&s;t Malefactor, being cru|cified between two Thieves, is indeed the <HI>ju&s;t One;</HI> and &s;uffered the Ju&s;t for the Un|ju&s;t, that he is the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s. He will convince Sinners that they can't be ju&s;tified but by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t received by Faith. Now his going to the Father was a Demon&s;tration of this, that he was Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Righteous, and had ful|filled all Righteou&s;ne&s;s. &mdash; <HI>And of Judg|ment.</HI> That all Judgment is committed to the Son as Lord and Chri&s;t, and that he hath Power as Mediator and in virtue of His O|bedience unto Death, to ca&s;t down Satan from his u&s;urped Throne, and deliver poor Sinners from his de&s;toying Power. Agre|ably where our Saviour &s;peaks of his being litted up upon the Cro&s;s, He &s;ays, <HI>Now is the Judgment of this World: Now &s;hall the Prince of this World be ca&s;t out,</HI> Joh. 12.31.</P>
<P>Having thus explained the Words of my Text, I return to con&s;ider that Part which I purpo&s;e more particularly to &s;peak to; the Work of the Spirit in reproving Men of Sin.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q>IT is the Work of the Holy Spirit, to con|vince and reprove Men of Sin.</Q>
<P>The Spirit of God is the great Di&s;pen|&s;er of common and &s;aving Grace. There is a <HI>&s;aving Conviction</HI> of Sin, which the Spirit of God works in the Hearts of Men when he enlightens them to di&s;cern &s;piritual Things after a &s;piritual manner. When God gives them the Light of the Knowledge of his Glory, they &s;ee that Evil in Sin as it is con|trary to him, his Nature and revealed Will, which cau&s;es them to mourn for it with that godly Sorrow which worketh Repentance to Salvation. <HI>Now mine Eye &s;eeth thee. Wherefore I abbor my &s;elf, and repent in Du&s;t and A&s;hes,</HI> Job 42.5, 6. They look unto Je&s;us as pierced by their Sins and mourn, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. Thus it is when the Spirit of Grace converts Men, and turns them from Sin to God, by working a &s;aving Change in their Hearts. And there is a <HI>legal Con|viction</HI> which the Spirit of God works in the Hearts of Men before Conver&s;ion, whereby they are awakened out of their carnal Secu|rity in Sin, and bro't under deep Concern about Deliverance from it as a de&s;troying Evil. Now it is a matter of the greate&s;t Im|portance to &s;uch as are under this Work,
<PB N="8" REF="004803_0008_100DF1EA8A470AE0">
that it be carried on till it i&s;&s;ue in a &s;aving Conver&s;ion to God. For the divine Spirit, who acts with &s;overeign Liberty, may be provok'd to depart, and leave Men to peri&s;h in their Sins. Thus the Spirit of God &s;trove with the Sinners of the old World, who&s;e departed Spirits are call'd <HI>Spirits in Pri&s;on,</HI> 1 Pet. 3, 19. Their Bodies were de&s;troy'd by the Flood, and their Souls are now &s;hut up in Hell, Where they are kept in durance to the Judgment of the great Day. And indeed it is plain from Scripture that the&s;e lower Workings of the Spirit, if I may &s;o call them, have been in &s;ome preparatory to &s;aving Conver&s;ion, while others have &s;tifled them. I &s;hall give you an In&s;tance of each from the Word of God, to awaken your Hopes and Fears, the great Springs of hu|man Endeavours. The rough and hardy <HI>Jaylor</HI> came trembling, and fell down before <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> &s;aying, Sirs, <HI>What mu&s;t I to be &s;aved?</HI> They an&s;wer, <HI>Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;ave</HI> And it &s;eems the Spirit &s;oon converted him even that &s;ame Night; yea gave him the Joy of God's Salvation. <HI>He rejoyced, be|lieving in God with all his Hou&s;e,</HI> Acts 16 29,&mdash; 34. O that this may be the happy Ca&s;e of the many now under Convictions! <HI>Felix</HI> al&s;o trembled, as <HI>Paul</HI> rea&s;oned of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, Temperance, and Judgment to come
<PB N="9" REF="004803_0008_100DF1EA8A470AE0">
<HI>Acts</HI> 24.25. Behold the Judge quaking for Fear before his Pri&s;oner! We may well &s;up|po&s;e a greater than <HI>Paul</HI> was there, even the <HI>Judge of all the Earth,</HI> reproving this Man for his Crimes by the Spirit accompanying <HI>Paul's</HI> faithful Mini&s;try: But then he un|happily endeavour'd to put off his Convicti|ons by &s;aying to <HI>Paul, Go thy way for this Time; when I have a convenient Sea&s;on, I will call for thee.</HI> And for ought any thing that appears, the Spirit cea&s;ed &s;triving with him. We read indeed that <HI>Felix</HI> &s;ent for <HI>Paul</HI> again; but not to hear the Word of God, and inquire how he &s;hould improve his Con|victions; but becau&s;e he hoped that Money &s;hould have been given him of <HI>Paul,</HI> that he might loo&s;e him, v. 26. A ba&s;e Thing in|deed! And after two Years, to &s;hew the <HI>Jews</HI> a Plea&s;ure, he left <HI>Paul</HI> bound, v. 27, Upon the whole, it is highly probable, that the convenient Sea&s;on, he pretended to wait for, never came. O it is a dangerous Thing to re&s;i&s;t the Spirit of God &s;triving with us, and as it were bid him depart from us!</P>
<P>I would now &s;peak particularly to the Doctrine under the&s;e following Heads;</P>

<P N="1"><HI>I. THE Holy Spirit is the Author of this Work of Conviction.</HI></P>
<P>That there is &s;uch a Work going before and preparatory to &s;aving Conver&s;ion in God's cho&s;en People, is evident from Scrip|ture and Experience. The Son of Man is come to &s;eek and &s;ave that which was lo&s;t; and the <HI>Prodigal Son</HI> is repre&s;ented as &s;en|&s;ible of his peri&s;hing Condition, before he re&s;olveth to <HI>ari&s;e and go to his Father,</HI>&mdash; Luke 15.17, 18. And our compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer inviteth them that <HI>labor and are heavy laden to come to him for re&s;t,</HI> Matth. 11.28. And we find from Examples upon Record in Scripture, as well as of later Date down to our own Times, that God takes this Cour&s;e with Men, convincing them of Sin and bringing them under a deep Con|cern about their Souls before he grants them the Joy of his Salvation. Now whatever <HI>In&s;truments</HI> may be u&s;ed in this Work, we mu&s;t acknowledge that the Spirit of God is the <HI>great Efficient.</HI> He &s;triveth with Men, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3.

They were <HI>prick|ed in their Heart,</HI> 37. <HI>v.</HI> And in a little Time &s;eem to have been &s;ubdued to the Obedience of Faith. Agreably, the Spirit of God is called a Spirit of Bondage, Rom. 8.15. <HI>Ye have not received the Spirit of Bon|dage again to fear.</HI> Indeed the holy Spirit can't be the Author of Sin whereby Men are brought into Bondage; but then He makes Sinners &s;en&s;ible of this cruel Bondage, and brings them to groan after Deliverance.</P>
<P N="2">II. We proceed to con&s;ider the Means which the Spirit of God u&s;eth to con|vince Men of Sin.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>THE great In&s;trument is the Word of God.</HI></P>
<P>And accordingly the Word is call'd the <HI>Sword of the Spirit,</HI> Eph. 6.17. <HI>All Scrip|ture is given by In&s;piration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Cor|rection,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.16. But then the &s;ame Spirit that moved tho&s;e holy Men who wrote the Scriptures, mu&s;t accompany them with his divine Influence; or there will be &s;ad Occa&s;ion to take up that Lamentation, <HI>Who hath believed our Report? and to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</HI> I&s;a. 58.1. When the Spirit is withdrawn, we find that the Mini&s;try of the Word has little
<PB N="12" REF="004803_0010_100DF1EEF5E5A350">
or no good Effect upon the Hearts of Sin|ners. They are unmov'd as the Seats they &s;it upon: Their Ears are heavy and their Eyes &s;hut, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 6.10. But when this almigh|ty Spirit is pleas'd to take his Word into his own Hand, and wound the Sinners Con|&s;cience with it, he can no longer make light of the Commands or Threatnings; they come home to him, and reach his very Heart: <HI>He is convinced of all, he is judged of all,</HI> 1 Cor. 14.23. He is convinced of the Sins where|by he hath tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed God's holy Law, and his Heart condemneth him for them. Now the Word of God <HI>is quick, and pow|erful, and &s;harper than any two edged Sword, piercing even to t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> dividing a&s;under of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Marrow, and is a Di&s;cerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart,</HI> Heb. 4.12. The Law of God is call'd a <HI>fiery Law,</HI> Deut. 33.2. And it may well be &s;o call'd, not only as it was de|liver'd out of the mid&s;t of the Fire, from the burning Mountain; but al&s;o, as in it we have God's burning Wrath, and fiery Indignation again&s;t Sinners revealed from Heaven. Ac|cordingly when the Word of God is ac|companied with the Spirit, and &s;o comes with Power upon the Hearts of Sinners, they feel Pain and Angui&s;h, and are &s;en&s;ible of the deadly Wounds Sin hath given them. <HI>Is not my Word like as a Fire, &s;aith the Lord:
<PB N="13" REF="004803_0010_100DF1EEF5E5A350">
and like a Hammer that breaketh the Rock in Pieces?</HI> Jer. 23.29. When the Spirit takes it into his Hand, he breaks the Sin|ners carnal Confidences. By the <HI>Law</HI> is the <HI>Knowlege of Sin,</HI> and by it the Spirit reproves Men for their Sins, and convinceth them of their lo&s;t peri&s;hing Condition as Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of God's Law. So &s;harp and cutting were God's Reproofs of his ancient People by his Word in the Mouth of his holy Prophets, that he &s;ays, <HI>Therefore have I hewed them by the Prophets: I have &s;lain them by the Words of my Mouth,</HI> Ho&s;. 6.5.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Holy Spirit convinceth and re|proveth Men of Sin by <HI>God's providential Di&s;pen&s;ations, particularly by afflictive Pro|vidences.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes the Holy Spirit makes u&s;e of the divine Goodne&s;s to lead Sinners to Repen|tance, Rom, 2.4. And draweth them as with the Cords of a Man, and Bands of Love. A|greably it is promis'd that the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> &s;hould <HI>fear the Lord, and his Goodne&s;s</HI> in the latter Days, <HI>Ho&s;</HI> 3.5. But I am now con&s;idering the Reproof given by Afflicti|ons. When Sinners re&s;i&s;t the Spirit &s;peak|ing to them in and by his Word, he &s;ome|times takes the Rod, and teacheth them as <HI>Gideon</HI> taught the Men of <HI>Succoth</HI> with Briars and Thorns of the Wilderne&s;s. And when they are thus torn and wounded, they are bro't to con&s;ider what an evil Thing Sin
<PB N="14" REF="004803_0011_100DF1F1DD983F88">
is, and their need of a Saviour to deliver them from it. Thus God &s;aid to his anci|ent People by the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah. Thine own Wickedne&s;s &s;hall correct thee, and thy Back|&s;lidings &s;hall reprove thee: know therefore and &s;ee, that it is an evil Thing and bitter that thou ha&s;t for&s;aken the Lord thy God, and that my Fear is not in thee, &s;aith the Lord God of ho&s;ts.</HI> Chap. 2.9. Outward Pro&s;perity is apt to make Men carele&s;s and &s;ecure; to &s;ay with the Church of the <HI>Laodiceans, I am rich, and increa&s;ed with Goods, and have need of nothing.</HI> But now, When God brings Men into Straits and under Difficulties, He &s;ometimes awakeneth them to a &s;erious Re|flection upon their &s;piritual Poverty, Mi&s;ery and Wretchedne&s;s, <HI>I &s;pake unto thee in thy Pro&s;perity, but thou &s;aid&s;t, I will not hear: this hath been thy manner from thy Youth, that thou obeyed&s;t not my Voice. The Wind &s;hall eat up all thy Pa&s;tors, and thy Lovers &s;hall go into Captivity, &s;urely then &s;halt thou be a&s;hamed and confounded for all thy Wicked|ne&s;s,</HI> Jer. 22.21, 2. And thus it was with <HI>Ephraim</HI> when he bore the Reproach of the Sins of his Youth under God's Cha&s;ti&s;ements, Jer. 31.18. <HI>I have &s;urely heard Ephraim bemoaning him&s;elf thus, Thou ha&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ed me, and I was cha&s;ti&s;ed, as a Bullock unaccu&s;tomed to the Yoke: turn thou me and I &s;hall be turn|ed; for thou art the Lord my God.</HI> Tho' the&s;e Words nextly refer to God's People,
<PB N="15" REF="004803_0011_100DF1F1DD983F88">
they may be fitly applied to particular Per&s;ons. When God corrects Men, and by his Spirit opens their Ears to Di&s;cipline, he &s;haws them the Nece&s;&s;ity of their turning to God, and maketh them concern'd to obtain convert|ing Grace. <HI>Turn thou me</HI>&mdash;. O that this may be the happy Ca&s;e of the many young People who are under Convictions at this Time! <HI>Dear Children!</HI> Ask the Spirit of Grace as a Spirit of Regeneration and Adop|tion, that you may have your weary Souls reviv'd with that good Word which follow|eth, <HI>v.</HI> 20. <HI>Is Ephraim a dear Son? is he a plea&s;ant Child? for &s;ince I &s;pake again&s;t him, I do earne&s;tly remember him &s;till: therefore my Bowels are troubled for him: I will &s;ure|ly have Mercy upon him, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> But to return, When Per&s;ons are &s;ecure, God cometh upon them, takes away their Health, and brings them &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider their latter End. God &s;haketh me over the Grave, &s;ays the awakened Sinner, and what will be|come of me, if I die in my Sins, if I die out of Chri&s;t? Again, God comes &amp; taketh away their earthly Goods, and &s;o convinceth them of the Evil of tru&s;ting in uncertain Riches, and awakens them to &s;eek that good Part which can't be taken away. Again, God bereaveth Men of their near and dear Friends, and &s;o quickens them to &s;eek the Favour and Friend&s;hip of the eternal God, making them ta&s;te the Bitterne&s;s of Sin as it hath brought
<PB N="16" REF="004803_0012_100DF1F43B651BD0">
Death into the World, and &s;hewing them the Vanity of Creatures. We read of tho&s;e Sinners, P&s;al. 78.34, 5. <HI>When he &s;lew them, then they &s;ought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. And they re|membred that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer.</HI> And was it not thus with this People in the Time of the EARTH|QUAKE, when God threatned to &s;end us down quick into the Pit? Did not Multi|tudes tremble as the <HI>Jailor,</HI> and inquire with great Concern, what mu&s;t we do to be &s;aved? How did People flock to God's Hou&s;e, and with what aw did they attend to his Word, while the Foundations of the Earth were &s;haken under us! Yea, I humbly apprehend that there is Rea&s;on to believe that the mighty Voice uttered from the deep Pla|ces of the Earth, together with the &s;till Voice of God's Word, was &s;anctified not only for the Conviction, but al&s;o for the Conven&s;ion of Numbers of People, by the Spirit of God. So far as we can judge, there were a Num|ber, whom the Terrors of that dreadful Night awakened, whom the Spirit effectually call'd. While it is to be fear'd that the Im|pre&s;&s;ions made on a far greater Number wore off, and dyed away. I the rather men|tion this remarkable Providence, becau&s;e I apprehend that the Time of it was a Sea&s;on in which God was plea&s;ed in a general and extraordinary manner to &s;trive with this
<PB N="17" REF="004803_0012_100DF1F43B651BD0">
People. Since that we have been vi&s;ited with a very mortal Sickne&s;s, in which God hath cut off many of our Children; but I cannot learn that People have been awakened in any Proportion to the exceeding Awful|ne&s;s of the Judgment.</P>
<P N="3">3. The holy Spirit makes u&s;e of <HI>His Works of Grace to convince and awaken Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>At &s;ometimes the Spirit is awfully re&s;train'd, and then Conver&s;ions are rare and doubtful. At other Sea&s;ons, God is pleas'd to pour out His Spirit upon his People, and then his Works of Grace, are as the Light which goeth forth. Many ask the Way to <HI>Zion,</HI> with their Faces thitherward, and not a few declare God's Works of Grace towards them with rejoicing. Convictions and Conver&s;ions become more frequent and apparent, &s;o far as our Judg|ment reacheth. It is true, the &s;aving Con|ver&s;ion of others can't be certainly known by us in the ordinary Way, becau&s;e we are not able to look directly into the Heart, but mu&s;t judge by outward Appearances. And there|fore we ought to exerci&s;e Judgment with Charity. But then there are &s;ometimes Fruits of the Spirit &s;o evident, that they can't be conceal'd or denied. There is the <HI>Mani|fe&s;tation of the Spirit</HI> in his divine Operations. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.7. Per&s;ons that were before quiet in their Sins and unconcerned, are &s;o awakened that they can't &s;tifle their Convictions, nor
<PB N="18" REF="004803_0013_100DF1F5DCC3DC70">
conceal their Di&s;tre&s;s; but are made to cry out, <HI>What &s;hall we do?</HI> How &s;hall we e&s;cape the Wrath to come? And when a Son or Daughter, or any other in a Family are thus wrought upon, the Hou&s;e is alarm'd with it, and thus their Friends and Acquain|tants are happily pre&s;s'd with Concern a|bout their own Souls by the Convictions of o|thers, when the Spirit of God is pleas'd to u&s;e them as Means for this End. And when &s;uch a Work of Grace &s;preads and increa|&s;eth thro' the good Hand of God upon his People, it will be &s;till more ob&s;ervable, and &s;uch as are con&s;iderate, will be ready to &s;ay admiring, What hath God wrought! Yea, all that behold it, mu&s;t now &s;ee, if they will open their Eyes, that there's more in Reli|gion than a lifele&s;s Formality, and outward Attendance on Ordinances. When the Work of God is thus reviv'd among a Peo|ple, the Form of Godline&s;s will be animated with the inward Life and Power of it. God's own Children will be quicken'd to ari&s;e and trim their Lamps, that their Light may &s;hine before others. And &s;uch as were Strangers to Religion before, will now pre&s;s into the Kingdom of Heaven. That De&s;cription well agreeth to &s;uch a Sea&s;on. <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven &s;uffereth Violence, and the Violent take it by Force,</HI> Matth. 11 12. The Mini|&s;ters of Chri&s;t will be encouraged and enli|vened in their Work, and &s;uch as are un|der
<PB N="19" REF="004803_0013_100DF1F5DCC3DC70">
Convictions will be awakened to a more diligent Attendance on the Word and Ordi|nances. Now &s;uch things as the&s;e, under the Influence of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, mu&s;t have an happy tendency to rou&s;e the &s;leepy &s;ecure Sinner, and reprove him for his cri|minal Indifferency in the great Concerns of his Soul. And thus the holy Spirit maketh u&s;e of the Works of his Grace to convince Men of their Sin and Danger, while they behold a great Alteration in others for the better; but have not felt the like in them|&s;elves. That God who formeth the Spirit of Man within him, hath <HI>fa&s;hioned their Hearts alike;</HI> &s;o that as in Water, Face an&s;wereth to Face; <HI>&s;o the Heart of Man to Man.</HI> P&s;al, 33.15. Prov. 27.29. Whence ari&s;eth a kind of Sympathy and Affection re&s;pecting each other; &s;o that what toucheth the one; af|fecteth the other. And this is in an e&s;pe|cial manner ob&s;ervable in &s;uch as are near and dear to each other. When the Child is in Di&s;tre&s;s, the tender Parent is pre&s;ently touched with the feeling of it's Sorrow: When the Brother crieth out in Angui&s;h of Soul, the kind Si&s;ter can't forbear to con|dole with him. Accordingly, When it plea|&s;eth the holy Spirit to u&s;e the&s;e Inclinations and Affections in Men as Means, good im|pre&s;&s;ion, by the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, wonderfully propagate and multiply. This I find ob&s;erv'd by a Reverend and dear Brother, in his <HI>Nar|rative</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="004803_0014_100DF1F7FB56A4B0">
of the &s;urpri&s;ing Work of God in the Conver&s;ion of many hundred Souls in <HI>North|hampton,</HI> and the neighbouring Towns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> "There is no one Thing that I know of that God has made &s;uch a Means of promo|ting His Work among&s;t us, as the News of others Conver&s;ion; in the awakening Sin|ners, and engaging them earne&s;tly to &s;eek the &s;ame Ble&s;&s;ing, and in the quickening of Saints."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Mr. Edward's <HI>Narrative,</HI> P. 39.</NOTE> And as more lately, we have receiv'd <HI>good News</HI> of this kind from more di&s;tant Places upon this Continent; &s;o I can't but hope that God's &s;ending one and another of his Servants among us who had been per&s;o|nally acquainted with the&s;e later wonderful Works of Grace, together with their very laborious and fervent Preaching, and the Mi|ni&s;try of others his Servants; has been ble&s;'d to convince many of their Sins, and awaken them to a &s;erious Concern about their Souls. Yea, It is hopeful that there are a Number converted, and brought home to Chri&s;t. Let us give the Prai&s;e to the God of all Grace: And let Pa&s;tors and Parents, and other Chri|&s;tians in their &s;everal Places u&s;e their be&s;t Endeavours to forward this good Work; for tho' the Work is the Lord's, and he alone can carry it on with victorious Succe&s;s; yet he delights to u&s;e his People as In&s;truments,
<PB N="21" REF="004803_0014_100DF1F7FB56A4B0">
and expects that in the way of Duty they ask His Ble&s;&s;ing in the more plentiful and exten&s;ive Effu&s;ions of his Spirit. Thus when God had promi&s;ed to give his People a <HI>new Heart; to put his Spirit within them,</HI> and cau&s;e them to walk in his Statutes: He adds, <HI>I will yet for this be enquired of by the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to do it for them,</HI> Ezek. 36.37.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> The 3d Head is <HI>to give &s;ome De&s;crip|tion of this Work of the Spirit in Con|viction.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall at pre&s;ent, only ob&s;erve a few Things in general relating to it,</P>
<P>This Work of the Spirit is by Divines commonly call'd <HI>Preparatory,</HI> as it goeth be|fore &s;aving Conver&s;ion, and is wrought in order to it, re&s;pecting &s;uch as are afterwards effectually call'd by the Spirit. By this Work, &s;ays the excellent Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> "We under|&s;tand certain inherent Qualifications, coming between the carnal Re&s;t of the Soul in the State of Sin, and Conver&s;ion wrought in the Mini&s;try both of the Law and Go&s;pel, by the common Work of the Spirit concurring; whereby the Soul is put into a mini&s;terial Capacity of believing immediately, <HI>i. e.</HI> of immediate receiving the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t." This is the order in which God proceeds in the Work of his Grace on the Souls of &s;uch as are grown to Years of Under&s;tanding: He maketh them &s;en&s;ible of their Sin and Mi&s;ery,
<PB N="22" REF="004803_0015_100DF1FA10543CA0">
and &s;o brings them to &s;eek <HI>Je&s;us</HI> who &s;aveth his People from their Sins, and to &s;ubmit to him. Indeed this Work is neither the effi|cient nor meretorious Cau&s;e of their &s;aving Conver&s;ion; however in this Way God a|wakeneth his People to a diligent Attendance on the Means of Grace, till he &s;hall work in them to will and to do, and make them his <HI>willing People, in the Day of his Power.</HI> And here, we may ob&s;erve that we mu&s;t not pre&s;ume to limit and re&s;train the infinite Spirit of God in this matter, who is call'd the <HI>free Spirit,</HI> P&s;al. 51.12. No doubt there may be great Variety as to Degrees of Terror, as to the Time Per&s;ons are kept under it, and the like. And we mu&s;t take heed that in this re&s;pect we do not make our particular Expe|riences general Rules to judge of the State of Men <HI>God opened the Heart of Lydia,</HI> and the <HI>Jailor came trembling</HI> with the ut|mo&s;t Con&s;ternation. And it hath been ob|&s;erved that &s;ome have been kept under a Spi|rit of Bondage for a con&s;iderable Time, while other convinced Sinners have been in a &s;hort Time &s;urpris'd with a Vi&s;it from the holy Spirit of God as a Spirit of Adoption, which &s;uppo&s;eth the New-Birth. Again, as to out|ward Expre&s;&s;ions of deep Concern in Tears, wringing the Hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Per&s;ons under like inward deep Concern of Mind may con&s;ide|rably differ according to different Con&s;titu|tions and Tempers. Again, Some may have
<PB N="23" REF="004803_0015_100DF1FA10543CA0">
been more hainous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors than others, and God may impre&s;s their Minds with ter|rible Fears in &s;ome Proportion. Again, It's no improbable Suppo&s;ition, that &s;ome have been converted in early Childhood before they were capable of giving a di&s;tinct Ac|count of this Work. Nor need it &s;eem &s;trange, if &s;uch as have been favour'd with a pious Education and good Impre&s;&s;ions from their Childhood, &s;hould be more at a lo&s;s in this Matter, than &s;uch as have been &s;uddenly &s;urpris'd as <HI>Saul,</HI> while going on in open Rebellion again&s;t God, and &s;o knock'd down under the fearful Apprehen&s;ions of his Wrath, and then rais'd with the wonderful Manife&s;ta|tions of the free Grace of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;uper-abounding where Sin had abounded. Therefore &s;uch as find upon &s;trict and im|partial Examination, that they abhor them|&s;elves for Sin as it is contrary to the declarative Glory &amp; revealed Will of God, and &s;o turn from all Sin unto God, as their chief Good and highe&s;t End; that they are willing to &s;ubmit to Chri&s;t as their Prince and Saviour, tru&s;t|ing only to his Righteou&s;ne&s;s for their Ju&s;ti|fication before God, and taking his Yoke up|on them: I &s;ay, the&s;e Per&s;ons ought not to di&s;tre&s;s them&s;elves, becau&s;e they can't give &s;uch a di&s;tinct Account of the Time and Man|ner of this Work of Conviction, as &s;ome others can; nor yet have experienc'd &s;o great Terrors as others haye felt before they were
<PB N="24" REF="004803_0016_100DF1FD0CBC2990">
born of the Spirit. Such as have been made &s;en&s;ible of their lo&s;t and peri&s;hing Condition by the Fall, and then made willing to receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t in all his Offices as their only Saviour; have the Things found in them which go before, and accompany Salvation; and &s;hould be encourag'd to tru&s;t in the Name of the Lord, and &s;tay upon their God. How|ever, It is happy for &s;uch as are able to give a more clear and di&s;tinct Account of the pe|culiar Sea&s;on and Manner of this Work of the Spirit; for this has a tendency to bring their Minds to a better Settlement as to their A&s;&s;urance of the &s;aving Work of Grace wrought after it. On the other hand, Per&s;ons who have been under great Terrors, and now receive the Word with Joy, mu&s;t rejoice with holy Fear, and look to it that they have that contrite and humble Spirit with which the high and lofty One dwells, to revive the Spirit of the humble, and the Heart of the contrite One; For there is a Joy which is no true Sign of &s;aving Conver&s;ion. The &s;tony-ground Hearers we have de&s;crib'd by our Lord, who &s;earcheth the Heart, Matth. 13.20. <HI>He that received the Seed into &s;tony Places, the &s;ame is he that heareth the Word, and anon with Joy receiveth it:</HI> The &s;tony Heart was not taken away, nor was there any Root of &s;aving Grace; and accordingly in Time of Trial they wither'd. And then there's no &s;aving Virtue in legal Terrors to
<PB N="25" REF="004803_0016_100DF1FD0CBC2990">
convert Men; this Change is wrought accor|ding to the exceeding greatne&s;s of God's Pow|er. However, neither do I &s;peak the&s;e Things to damp their Joy who upon their Conver&s;ion may have receiv'd the <HI>Spirit of God to wit|ne&s;s with their Spirits, that they are the Chil|dren of God.</HI> And I make no doubt but this is the happy Ca&s;e of many, when the Spirit is poured out plentifully. When there were <HI>Three Thou&s;and</HI> Souls added, we read that <HI>they gladly receiv'd the Word,</HI> Acts 2.41. But then, I am concern'd that we may all obey that Word, and obtain the Benefit of it. <HI>Let every Man prove his own Work, and then &s;hall he have rejoicing in him&s;elf alone, and not in another,</HI> Gal. 6.4.</P>
<P>I would only further &s;ay at pre&s;ent, that when the Spirit of God convinceth Men of Sin, he &s;hews them the guilt and der&s;troying Power of their Sins; maketh them &s;en&s;ible of their Mi&s;ery and Danger as they lie ex|po&s;ed to the Cur&s;es of the Law, and brings them to &s;eek Deliverance with earne&s;tne&s;s and deep Concern. And thus the Spirit pre|pareth them to hearken to the gracious Invi|tations and Offers of the Go&s;pel, while he al&s;o &s;hews them their utter Inability to come up to the Terms of the Gospel in their own Strength, and their great Unworthine&s;s that God &s;hould work in them to will and to do. And therefore, that if they are &s;av'd, it mu&s;t be from the free &s;overeign Grace of God,
<PB N="26" REF="004803_0017_100DF1FF9441BEC8">
who has Mercy on whom he will have Mercy. And as to &s;uch whom the Spirit of God con|verts, he changeth their Hearts, renews them in the Spirit of their Minds re&s;pecting every Power of the Soul; and &s;o per&s;wadeth and enableth them to Tru&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>as the only Name given among Men wherely we mu&s;t be &s;aved;</HI> taking their Encouragement from the Grace of God, the Merits of Chri&s;t, and free Offers of the Go&s;pel. When Chri&s;t is thus formed in the Heart, the poor Creature &s;o highly &s;avour'd, is ready to cry out, Lord this Salvation is too great and good for me; but thou art worthy to be believed and obey'd, and nothing is too great or wonderful for thee. <HI>Be it unto me according to thy Word.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. In this Work of Conviction <HI>the Spirit of God brings Home the Sen&s;e of Sin and the Guilt to the Heart and Con&s;cience of the Sinner.</HI> And then his Spirit is wounded, and his Heart mov'd with Fear.

Many are in a lamentable manner ig|norant of the Strictne&s;s and Purity of God's Law, and at the &s;ame Time very much Stran|gers to their own deceitful Hearts. It &s;eem|eth that <HI>Paul,</HI> while Phari&s;ee, was not &s;en|&s;ible that the fir&s;t Motions of evil Concupi|&s;cence were Sin. Rom. 7.7.

and bribe their Con&s;ciences? whereby they are laid a&s;leep in carnal Security. <HI>There is a Way which &s;eemeth right unto a Man; but the End thereof are the Ways of Death,</HI> Prov. 14.12. So deceitful and de&s;perately wicked are the Hearts of Men. But when the Spirit of God comes with the Word to &s;hew Men their Iniquity, he detects and lays open this Deceit, and maketh the Sinner know that he has offended the holy, heart-&s;earching God, and &s;tands condemned by His righte|ous Law. Con&s;cience is awakened to do it's Office, and as it were &s;ays to the Sinner, <HI>Thou are the Man:</HI> And now, he beholdeth his Sin in it's hainous Nature and Aggrava|tions; and &s;elf-judged, maketh that Confe&s;&s;ion before the Lord, <HI>Again&s;t thee, thee only have I &s;inned, and done this Evil in they Sight,</HI> P&s;al. 51.4. When the Spirit of God reproveth Men of Sin, they dare not deny the Fact, nor excu&s;e the Fault or Crime cleaving to it. But rather deprecate God's entering into Judg|ment with them, &s;aying with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>If thou Lord, &s;hould&s;t mark Iniquities:</HI> O Lord, <HI>who &s;hall &s;tand</HI> P&s;al 130.3.

And tho; this may be at fir&s;t from Conviction of &s;ome particular Sin, as here of the Sin of Un|belief; yet the Spirit of God leads Men up
<PB N="40" REF="004803_0024_100DF20F461EAE50">
to the Con&s;ideration of their guiltine&s;s and vilene&s;s as Children of Apo&s;tate <HI>Adam;</HI> &s;hew|eth them that they &s;inned in him and fell with him, and that as they proceed from him they bring a corrupt Nature into the World with them, empty of Grace, and bent unto Sin. And now they are ready to &s;ub&s;cribe that Con|fe&s;&s;ion, P&s;al. 51.5. <HI>Behold I was &s;hapen in Iniquity: and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</HI> Now God's Word is &s;et home upon their Hearts, in which it is declared, that all are under Sin; there's none Righteous, no not one.

And they are ready to acknowledge that they were expos'd to the Wrath and Cur&s;e of God as a Generation of Vipers, even from their early Childhood. And whatever have been their outward Attendance on religious Duties, and blamele&s;s Behaviour before Men; they now find that they are Children of Wrath, even as others. This was the Ca&s;e of <HI>Saul,</HI> after|wards call'd <HI>Paul,</HI> tho' he had liv'd as a &s;trict Phari&s;ee, a blamele&s;s Life according to his under&s;tanding of the Law. <HI>I was alive with|out the Law once; but when the Command|ment came, Sin revived, and I died,</HI> Rom. 7.9. While a Phari&s;ee, tho' he had the Law in the Letter of it, yet he was wihtout the Law, be|ing dreadfully ignorant of the &s;piritual Mean|ing and U&s;e of it, as al&s;o of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">s Purity and ex|ten&s;ive Obligation and &s;o he tho't him&s;elf

And this is the Ca&s;e of the clo&s;e&s;t Hypocrites and mo&s;t &s;pe|cious Formali&s;ts, when the Spirit of God is pleas'd to convince and reprove them of Sin: When he thus by his Word of Providence &s;heweth them their Work, and their Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, that they have exceeded; they can no longer cover their Sins, nor flatter them|&s;elves in their evil Ways.

While a&s;leep in carnal Security, they dream of enjoying the Plea&s;ures of Sin, with|out enduring the Puni&s;hment. <HI>He flattereth him&s;elf in his own Eyes, until his Iniquity be found to be hateful.</HI> P&s;. 36.2. Thus it is &s;aid of the <HI>Young Man,</HI> void of Under&s;tanding, when enticed by the Adultere&s;s, <HI>He goeth after her &s;traightway, as an Ox goeth to the &s;laughter, or as a Fool to the correction of the &s;tocks: Till a Dart &s;trike through his Liver, as a Bird ha&s;teth to the Snare, and knoweth not that it is for his Life,</HI> Prov. 7.22, 23.

And accordingly, when the Spirit of God &s;hoots the Arrows of Conviction into the Sin|ners Heart, he &s;heweth him the daring Pre|&s;umption of this, and maketh him know that Sin is an evil Thing, and will be bitterne&s;s in the End.

Now there is a Work of Humiliation wrought, in which the Haugh|tine&s;s of the Sinner's Spirit is quelled, and he is ca&s;t down convinced that he can't re&s;i&s;t God,

and pro&s;per. He is made &s;en&s;ible that God can break him in Pieces, and that none is able to deliver out of his Hand.

He can't now drink down Iniquity like Water with greedine&s;s and delight, as he did before; but rather ab&s;tains from the outward Commi&s;&s;ion of it, and formeth Re&s;olutions again&s;t it.

<P>USE 1. <HI>Let us Inquire into the State of our Souls;</HI> particularly, <HI>Whether we have had the Experience of this Work of the Spirit.</HI> Has the Holy Spirit convinced us of our Sin and Mi&s;ery by the Fall, &s;o that we have been made &s;en&s;ible of our lo&s;t peri&s;hing State as we are the Children of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> in whom all die? It's true, there may be con&s;iderable Variety as to the Degree of the Spirit's Operation. Some may have greater Terror, and of longer Continuance than others, as we before ob&s;erved. But then, We have Rea&s;on to conclude that the Spirit of God is a Spirit of Bondage unto Fear, to every unconverted Per&s;on grown to Years of Under&s;tanding and Judgment, before He

is a Spirit of Regeneration and Adoption. And therefore &s;uch as are confident of their being in a State of Salvation, without a Con|viction of Sin, and painful Sen&s;e of the de|filing and de&s;troying Evil of it is; have ju&s;t Rea&s;on to fear that they deceive them&s;elves. Our Saviour declareth to the <HI>Laodiceans,</HI> who were puff'd up with a proud and fal&s;e Con|ceit of them&s;elves, that they were <HI>wretched,</HI> and <HI>mi&s;erable,</HI> and <HI>poor,</HI> and <HI>blind,</HI> and <HI>na|ked;</HI> before He coun&s;els them to come to him for <HI>Gold tried in the Fire,</HI> that they might be enriched with &s;aving Grace more precious than Gold, <HI>&amp;c. Rev.</HI> 3.17, 18. Let us then examine and try our&s;elves, whether we have ever felt the Burden of our Sins too heavy for us to bear, and been made &s;en&s;i|ble of the vile Corruption of our Hearts; &s;o as to cry to God for Deliverance, being convinced that nothing &s;hort of his Almighty Power and Grace can &s;ave us. And here, &s;up|po&s;ing the Ca&s;e, that &s;ome of you were conver|ted while very Young, yet it is incumbent on you to inquire, whether you have &s;uch a &s;piritual Sight of the Evil of Sin, as to be in bitterne&s;s upon the Account of it, and to be excited to work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling. This is plain, That the be&s;t of Men in this imperfect State have rea&s;on to cry out, <HI>Lord, Help our Unbelief!</HI> And to groan out that Complaint, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from
<PB N="59" REF="004803_0033_100DF22593287310">
the Body of this Death!</HI> Rom. 7.24. And when they have indulged them&s;elves for any Time in carnal Security, or fallen into &s;candalous Sins, the Spirit of God has &s;o withdrawn from them, that they have been brought into great Perplexity, and could have no &s;olid Peace till renewed to Repen|tance. This was <HI>David's</HI> Ca&s;e, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 51. And <HI>Peter</HI>'s, Luke 22.61, 62. Agreably, our Saviour &s;aid to him, <HI>When thou art con|verted, &s;trengthen thy Brethren,</HI> Luke 22.32. Indeed that God who hath begun a good Work in true Converts, will perform it un|til the Day of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. However, even the&s;e may need a further and more thorow Conver&s;ion from particular Ways of &s;inning, that they may be in a next Di&s;po&s;ition to attend the Duties and enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ings of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, after a comfortable manner, <HI>Matth.</HI> 18.3. Surely then, there's weighty Rea&s;on why we &s;hould all of us look into the State of our Souls, and inquire what Convictions we have experienced, and what hath been the I&s;&s;ue of them. And after all, we &s;hould make that Prayer, <HI>Search me O God, and know my Heart: try me, and know my thoughts. And &s;ee if there be any wicked Way in me, and lead me in the Way everla&s;ting,</HI> P&s;al. 139.23, 24.</P>
<P>USE 2. Are the Convictions of the Spirit &s;o &s;harp and pungent &s;ometimes? <HI>How dread|ful
<PB N="60" REF="004803_0034_100DF227E84C73B8">
mu&s;t it be then to fall under the vin|dictive Wrath of God in Hell forever?</HI></P>
<P>Do Sinners now while there is Hope, fear and tremble before the Lord when he thus reproveth them for Sin? Are they pricked to the Heart, and &s;ometimes ready to cry out under the heavy Load of Sin, <HI>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</HI> Certainly then the Torments of Hell will be altogether intol|erable; where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched. Hell is a bottom|le&s;s Pit, in which the damned &s;ink down in everla&s;ting De&s;pair, without the lea&s;t gleam of Hope, while the Wrath of God is poured out upon them to the uttermo&s;t. <HI>The Childreen of the Kingdom &s;hall be ca&s;t out into outer Darkne&s;s: there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of Teeth.</HI> Matth. 8.12 Can you not bear the Spirit's Convictions, when he &s;ets home the Threatnings of God's Word upon your Con&s;ciences? How will you then be able to hear that Sentence pronounc'd by your Lord and Judge; <HI>Depart from me ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels;</HI> and then to have it executed upon you. O you will be ut|terly con&s;umed with Terror!</P>
<P>USE 3. <HI>Let &s;uch as have their Hearts hardened from the Fear of God, a&s;k the Holy Spirit to convince them of their Sin and Dan|ger, before it be too late.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="004803_0034_100DF227E84C73B8">O let the Terrors of the Lord rou&s;e you!

For who hath hardened him&s;elf again&s;t God, and hath pro&s;pered? O let that awful Word &s;ink down into your Ears, and into your Hearts! <HI>He that being often reproved, hard|neth his Neck, &s;hall &s;uddenly be de&s;troyed, and that without Remedy.</HI> Prov. 29.1.

You can't but hear others complaining of an hard Heart, and de&s;iring Prayers that God would take away the &s;tony Heart and give an Heart of Fle&s;h, tender and quick to receive the Impre&s;&s;ions of God's Word and Spirit. And are you &s;till uncon|cern'd? How dangerous a Symptom is this? What a deadly Lethargy has &s;eiz'd your Souls?

Rom. 11.8 And let your &s;ad Experience teach you that it is not in Men nor outward Means to convince you of Sin and awaken you out of your carnal Security, unle&s;s the Spirit ac|company the&s;e Means, &amp; apply them to your Souls. And accordingly, Mourn bitterly becau&s;e you have re&s;i&s;ted and vexed the good Spirit of God, and take heed you proceed no further, <HI>to do de&s;pite to the Spirit of Grace;</HI> and &s;o live only to fill up the mea&s;ure of your Sins, and to ripen for a much &s;orer Puni&s;hment, than many others who peri&s;h, &s;hall endure. O thou infinitely powerful and gracious God! with whom all Things are po&s;&s;ible, do thou awaken them, and pluck them as Brands out of the Fire.</P>
<P>USE 4. <HI>Let &s;uch as have received the Spirit of God as a Spirit of Conviction, che|ri&s;h His Motions, and cry to God more ear|ne&s;tly for His Spirit, as a Spirit of Regene|ration and Adoption.</HI></P>

But then you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that this can't be by any Might or Power of your own; but only by the Spirit of the Lord of ho&s;ts. Look above your &s;elf then and all Creatures unto the Lord, that you may be &s;aved. And let it encourage you, that this Work is in the Hands of the <HI>good Spirit</HI> of God, who delighteth in Holine&s;s; and may be call'd the Holy Spirit in Scrip|ture, partly becau&s;e it is his Work to renew God's People in the Spirit of their Minds, after the Image of God which con&s;i&s;ts in Knowledge, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s: That it is in the Hands of the <HI>Almighty Spirit</HI> of God, who can convert you more ea&s;ily than you can &s;peak a Word. Surely nothing is to be de&s;pair'd of, while this divine Spirit is working upon your Hearts. O &s;eek the more earne&s;tly then to that God who is able to do for you above all you can ask or think! And now &s;trive even as in an Agony, that you may enter in at the &s;trait Gate of a &s;aving Conver&s;ion. Why may it not be this Night? Why may there not be a &s;aving Union be|tween Chri&s;t and your Souls even Now? Come, All Things are ready. O God! Do thou draw them; for there is no Man can come to the Son, except the Father draw

him. We wait for thee, more than they that Watch for the Morning. May the Power of the Lord be pre&s;ent to heal the broken in Heart, &amp; bind up their Wounds!

<P>USE 5. <HI>Let &s;uch as have receive'd the holy Spirit, as a Spirit of Adoption, Prai&s;e the God of all Grace, and walk humbly with him.</HI></P>
<P>Hath God revealed his Son in and to you, by giving you his Spirit to convince you of his Righteon&s;ne&s;s, and to enable you to be|lieve in him to the &s;aving of your Souls? Is the Love of God thus &s;hed abroad in your Hearts, by the Holy Gho&s;t? Is Chri&s;t thus formed in you? Hail, you are highly fa|voured, the Lord is with you, and you are ble&s;&s;ed. <HI>Fle&s;h and Blood have not revealed the Son of God unto you, but the Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Let your Souls then magni|fy the Lord, and your Spirits rejoice in God your Saviour. Give Glory to God, and &s;ay each one of you after Chri&s;t, <HI>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e Things from the Wi&s;e and Prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto Babes.

Of true Joy it is &s;aid, <HI>The Joy of the Lord is your Strength.</HI> Neh 8.10. Let it be as Oyl to the Wheels of your Obedience, and let your Hearts be lift up in the Ways of God, while you happily find that the Ways of Wi&s;dom are Ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her Paths Peace. Say with the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul, Our re|joicing is this, the Te&s;timony of our Con&s;cience, that in Simplicity &amp; godly Sincerity, not with fle&s;hly Wi&s;dom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our Conver&s;ation in the World,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.12. O take heed, beware of Pride and carnal Security! <HI>Serve the Lord with Fear, and rejoice with trembling.</HI> And when God hath &s;poken Peace, turn not again to Folly. <HI>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are &s;ealed to the Day of Redemp|tion;</HI> but walk in him, and you &s;hall not ful|fil the Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h. Do not boa&s;t as if your Work was done, and your War|fare accompli&s;hed; but rather expect to meet with Temptations, and put on the whole Armour of God, that you may be able to &s;tand again&s;t the Wiles of the Devil. Think it not &s;trange, if God &s;hould hide his Face, after you have had the Light of his

Countenance lifted up upon you. This is no other Trial than what many of God's Children have endured. Be encouraged then to hear and obey that Word, I&s;a 50.10. <HI>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the Voice of his Servant, that walk|eth in Darkne&s;s, and hath no Light? let him tru&s;t in the Name of the Lord, and &s;tay upon his God.</HI> Hope in God, and wait patiently for him, till he &s;hall cau&s;e light to ari&s;e a|gain unto you. And let none of the&s;e Things move you, neither count your Lives dear, that you may fini&s;h your Cour&s;e with Joy.</P>
<P>To conclude, Let us with humble Thank|fulne&s;s behold that <HI>remarkable Work of Grace</HI> which I tru&s;t God is carrying on in this <HI>Town,</HI> and other Places; and be encouraged to &s;eek the Lord more earne&s;tly, that His Kingdom may come with Power by the more plentiful Effu&s;ions of his Holy Spirit; and that the Lord would rebuke Satan in all his Attempts to hinder or reproach this Work, and <HI>brui&s;e him under our Feet.</HI> Let us ble&s;s God for His Spi|rit &amp; Grace manife&s;ted in &amp; with <HI>His Servants</HI> that have preached the Go&s;pel among us, and for the great Succe&s;s which has attended their painful Labours. However, Let us not have Men's Per&s;ons in Admiration becau&s;e of Ad|vantage; but remember that Word, <HI>So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth: but God that giveth the increa&s;e,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.7. And accordingly, Let
<PB N="67" REF="004803_0037_100DF2303A28C758">
the Glory be given to the God of all Grace. And my Brethren, I apprehend we &s;hould reflect upon it as a Fault and Infirmity, that tho' you had &s;uch repeated Opportunities of hearing tho&s;e <HI>worthy Per&s;ons,</HI> that yet one and another A&s;&s;embly hath been crowded in &s;uch a manner, as even to make Di&s;tur|bance on the Lord's-Day, while others have been in a con&s;iderable Degree left de&s;titute. <HI>Finally Brethren, pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may have free Cour&s;e and be glorified.</HI> And let the &s;tated Provi&s;ion of God's Hou&s;e be duely valued by you. Let your Zeal for the Ordinances con|tinue, and be manife&s;ted in your con&s;tant and diligent Attendance on the publick Wor&s;hip, in an e&s;pecial Manner on the <HI>Lord's-Day.</HI> And when you wait upon God in the u&s;e of the Means of Grace, always bear in Mind tho&s;e Words, <HI>I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to Profit,</HI> I&s;a. 58.17. And let that Apo&s;tolical Exhorta|tion be duely regarded by you, <HI>We be&s;eech you Brethren, to know them that labour a|mong you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoni&s;h you; And to e&s;teem them very highly in Love for their Works &s;ake. And be at Peace among your &s;elves.</HI> 1 The&s;. 5.12, 13. The more there is of mutual E&s;teem and Love between Mini&s;ters and their Peo|ple, the fairer Pro&s;pect is there of the Suc|ce&s;s of their Mini&s;try. And the more con|cern'd
<PB N="68" REF="004803_0038_100DF23206F36758">
we are to &s;tudy the Things which make for Peace, the more likely &s;hall we be to edify one another. When Brethren dwell together in unity, God commandeth the Ble&s;&s;ing on <HI>Zion,</HI> See <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 133. Let us then avoid all unchri&s;tian Heats and Animo&s;ities, all ra&s;h judging and cen&s;uring one another: And in oppo&s;ition to this, let all unite their be&s;t Endeavours, in their &s;everal Places, to promote the great Intere&s;t of pure and un|defiled Religion; that Chri&s;t may increa&s;e, and his Kingdom flouri&s;h among us. And may it plea&s;e the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to ble&s;s you and all his People by fulfilling that good Word, Ezek. 39.29. <HI>Neither will I hide my Face any more from them: for I have poured out my Spirit upon the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, &s;aith the Lord God. And ble&s;&s;ed be his glorious Name for|ever, and let the whole Earth be filled with his Glory;</HI> Amen, <HI>and</HI> Amen!</P>

<P N="1">1. The Spirit of God convinceth Men <HI>that Je&s;us of Nazareth is Chri&s;t the Righteous; the true Me&s;&s;iah, and no Impo&s;tor.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Words are under&s;tood by fome as e&s;pecially intending Chri&s;t's own <HI>per&s;onal Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Je&s;us is the Son of God, and one with the Father in the e&s;&s;ential Perfec|tions and Rectitude of the divine Nature. <HI>I and my Father are one.</HI> John 10.30.

<P><PB N="74" REF="004803_0041_100DEE3FC85ECAB0">And this is &s;uppos'd by worthy Expo&s;itors to be principally intended in the Words. One of the glorious Titles given to our Lord Je&s;us is that, <HI>The Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Jer. 23.6. It was prophe&s;ied of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> that he &s;hould fini&s;h the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, make an end of Sins, make Reconciliation for Iniqui|ty, and <HI>bring in everla&s;ting Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Dan. 9.24. And it is no &s;mall Part of the Glory of the Go&s;pel, that in it the <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of God is revealed from Faith to Faith,</HI> Rom. 1.16, 17. Here it is declared that the Son of God in our Nature was <HI>made Sin</HI> for his People, the Iniquities of God's People be|ing laid upon him; that <HI>they might he made the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him,</HI> having his perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to them for their Ju&s;tification, when they receive him by Faith. Indeed this great Doctrine was to the carnal Jews a &s;tumbling-Block. <HI>For they being ignorant of God's Righteou&s;ne&s;s and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, have not &s;ubmitted them&s;elves unto the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of God,</HI> Rom. 10.3.

But now, when the Spirit of God has convinced his People of their Sin, and made them &s;en&s;ible that they mu&s;t go out of them&s;elves for Righteou&s;ne&s;s, he revealeth the Son to them, in whom God

is reconciling the World to him&s;elf, not im|puting their Iniquities; and maketh manife&s;t <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, which is by Faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto all, and upon all them that believe,</HI> Rom. 3.21, 22. This divine Spirit &s;heweth them the Fulne&s;s, the Suffici|ency of this Righteou&s;ne&s;s for their Ju&s;ti|fication; and enableth them, even when they have the deepe&s;t Sen&s;e of the greatne&s;s of their Sins, to rely upon Chri&s;t, that they may be accepted as Righteous with God.

And no doubt, with ex|traordinary Gifts, there was al&s;o given to the Apo&s;tles by the &s;ame Spirit, a great Increa&s;e of &s;piritual Knowledge and Faith, Zeal and Courage, Humility and Patience, Love to God and Man, and other Graces, to carry them well thro' their Services and Sufferings for the Name of Je&s;us. Our Saviour promi&s;ed his Di&s;ciples, that he would give them <HI>a Mouth and Wi&s;dom which all their Adver&s;aries &s;hould not be able to gain&s;ay, orre&s;i&s;t,</HI> Luk. 21.15.

And required them not to be anxiou&s;ly con|cern'd how or what they &s;hould &s;peak when brought before Governours and Kings for his &s;ake; for &s;ays our Lord, <HI>It is not ye that &s;peak, but the Spirit of your Father which is in you,</HI> Matth. 10.20. Accordingly when <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> had wrought a wonderful Miracle in re&s;toring a Man lame from his Mother's Womb, and <HI>Peter</HI> fill'd with the Holy Gho&s;t, had declared that it was by the Name of Je&s;us, that the Man &s;tood before them whole, and then that there was no other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved: It is ob&s;erved, Acts 4.13. <HI>Now when they &s;aw the boldne&s;s of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant Men, they marvelled, and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Je&s;us.</HI> Yea, the&s;e Enemies of Chri&s;t were convicted by their own Con&s;ciences that a notable Miracle had been done, <HI>ver.</HI> 16.

win Chri&s;t, and enjoy the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the invi&s;ible World where He is! Such was the wonderful Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel when preached <HI>with the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ent down from Heaven.</HI> Accordingly, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> ob|&s;erveth, <HI>That God hath cho&s;en the fooli&s;h Things of this World, to confound the wi&s;e; and God hath cho&s;en the weak Things of the World to confound the mighty; And ba&s;e Things of the World, and Things which are de&s;pi&s;ed, hath God cho&s;en, yea, and Things which are not, to bring to nought Things which are.</HI> 1 Cor. 1.27, 28 Here tho&s;e Words may be well applied, <HI>Not by Mighty, nor by Power, but by my Spirit, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts,</HI> Zoch. 4.6 Now &s;urely the Spirit of Truth and Holine&s;s would never have wrought &s;uch Works of Grace by the preaching of the Name of Je&s;us, had not He been Chri&s;t the Righteous. 1 Tim. 3.16. <HI>Without controver&s;y, great is the my&s;tery of godline&s;s: God was ma|nife&s;t in the Fle&s;h, ju&s;tifyed in the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. I would offer <HI>&s;ome brief De&s;cription of this Work of the Spirit, in convincing Men of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Now in this Work the Spirit of God doth not only give external Evidence in the Re|velation of God's Word; but al&s;o applieth him&s;elf inwardly to the Heart, and opens the Under&s;tanding to di&s;cern the&s;e &s;piritual Things concerning Chri&s;t and his Righte|teou&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="90" REF="004803_0049_100DF24EE1D81BB8">
after a &s;piritual manner. So that &s;uch as are thus favoured, &s;ee the Son, and believe on him as the true Me&s;&s;iah and only Saviour, with that Faith which <HI>is the Evidence of Things not &s;een,</HI> Heb. 11.1. The Spirit of God enlightens the Minds of his People with the &s;aving Knowledge of Chri&s;t and his Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. Agreeably the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> de|clareth, 1 Joh. 2.30. <HI>Ye have an Unction from the holy One, and ye know all Things,</HI> i.e. All Things concerning Chri&s;t and the chri&s;tiain Religion nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation. The Spirit of God may be compared to <HI>Oyl,</HI> as this was u&s;ed for Light, and in Medicine. The Spi|rit heals the vi&s;ive Faculty of the Soul, and removeth &s;piritual Blindne&s;s. He reneweth his People in Knowledge, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.10. There|fore when our Lord had declared to the <HI>Lao|diceans</HI> that they were blind, he coun&s;els them to <HI>anoint their Eyes with Eye-&s;alve, that they might &s;ee,</HI> Rev. 3.18.

The <HI>Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;eth</HI> upon the convinced Sinner, <HI>with heal|ing in his Wings</HI> "or in his Beams". The Doctrine of God our Saviour appeareth in it's Reality, Importance and Excellency.</P>
<P>And accordingly,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="91" REF="004803_0049_100DF24EE1D81BB8">1. The <HI>Work of the Spirit in this Con|viction, is a &s;aving Work.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed there may be &s;ome Per&s;wa&s;ion of the&s;e Things from Education, there may be a notional Knowledge and hi&s;torical Faith; yea we may have the common Illumination of the Spirit, and receive the Revelations of the Go&s;pel with a tran&s;ient Joy; and yet not &s;ee the glorious Beauty and divine Glory of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;o as to count all Things but lo&s;s for the Excellency of the Knowledge of him.

No, I humbly conceive that in pa&s;&s;ive Conver&s;ion there is the habitual Change of all the Faculties of the Soul wrought at once, by the divine Operation of the Holy Spirit: And then the Under&s;tanding, now &s;avingly en|lightned, beholds Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in order of Na|ture before the Will &amp; Affections are drawn to clo&s;e with him and cleave unto him; yea &s;o as to incline them to act agreable to the Di&s;covery made of this glorious Object.
<PB N="92" REF="004803_0050_100DF275AD8A3400">
This is then a &s;aving Work of the Spirit of God. When <HI>Peter</HI> therefore had made that Confe&s;&s;ion of his Faith, <HI>Thou art Chri&s;t the Son of the living God.</HI> Our Lord pronounc'd him Happy, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed art thou Simon Bar-jona: for Fle&s;h and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven,</HI> Matth. 16.16, 17.

<P N="2">2. In this Work <HI>the Spirit of God giveth the convinced Sinner &s;atisfying Evidence of Chri&s;t's Ability and readine&s;s to ju&s;tify and &s;ave all that come to God by him.</HI></P>
<P>He convinceth them that how many &amp; great &s;oever their Sins have been, yet in Chri&s;t they may have a Righteou&s;ne&s;s every way &s;uffici|ent for their Ju&s;tification before God, and to give them a &s;ure Title to eternal Life, ac|cording to the new and everla&s;ting Covenant.

<P>We have the &s;tronge&s;t Evidence that Je|&s;us is the Chri&s;t the only Saviour, in the Word of God. The Doctrines therein delivered concerning Chri&s;t, the Hi&s;tory of wonderful Miracles and Works of Grace wrought by the Spirit in the Name of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> put this beyond all rea&s;onable Doubt.

And &s;till the Sin and Danger of this is grea|ter, when we have had the Spirit of God &s;tri|ving with us.

<Q>IT is the Work of the Holy Spirit to con|vince Men of Judgment.</Q>
<P>Under this Doctrine we may con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. What are we to under&s;tand by Judg|ment.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Means which the Spirit u&s;eth to convince Men of this Judgment.</P>
<P N="3">3. I &s;hall give &s;ome brief Di&s;cription of this Work of the Spirit in convincing Men of Judgment.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>What are we to under&s;tand by Judg|ment?</HI></P>
<P>An&s;. 1. <HI>We may under&s;tand it of that un|ju&s;t Judgment which Men pa&s;s'd on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as if he &s;uffer'd for his own Crimes, and his Di&s;ciples ought to &s;uffer for confe&s;&s;ing his Name before Men.</HI></P>
<P>We read of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> that in his Humiliation, <HI>his Judgment was taken away,</HI> Acts 8.33. Tho' <HI>Pilate</HI> declared, having examin'd him before his Accu&s;ers, that he found no fault in him touching tho&s;e Things whereof they accu&s;ed him; yet the Voices of the Multi|tude, and of the High Prie&s;ts prevailed; &s;o that <HI>Pilate</HI> gave Sentence it &s;hould be as they reque&s;ted, <HI>Luke</HI> 23.34. Many were ignorant of the Go&s;pel Revelation concern|ing
<PB N="104" REF="004803_0056_100DF25B27EDD128">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Which none of the Princes of this World knew: For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.8. And the chri&s;tian Re|ligion is mention'd as <HI>a Sect</HI> or Here&s;y <HI>every where &s;poken again&s;t,</HI> Acts 28.22. Thus was the holy Je&s;us &s;et <HI>for a Sign which &s;hould be &s;poken again&s;t,</HI> Luke 2.34. But when the Spirit of God came to di&s;charge his Office as an Advocate in behalf of our a&s;cended Saviour, he convinced many of the great Wrong they had done in this Matter, and rebuked them &s;harply; &s;o that they were brought to judge and condemn them&s;elves. Thus after our Lord had appeared to <HI>Saul,</HI> &s;aying by a Voice from Heaven, <HI>I am Je&s;us whom thou per&s;ecute&s;t,</HI> and the Spirit of God had wrought a thorough Change in him; he freely acknowledged <HI>that he had been a bla&s;|phemer, and a per&s;ecutor, and injurious,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.13.</P>
<P N="2">2. By Judgment we may under&s;tand <HI>the Power given to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to go|vern the World, and to execute Judgment upon Satan, that grand U&s;urper, and all that ad|here to him, in Oppo&s;ition to the Kingdom of God.</HI> Agreeably it is &s;aid, II ver. <HI>Of Judg|ment, becau&s;e the Prince of this World is judged.</HI> After our Lord's Re&s;urrection he &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>All Power is given into me in Hea|ven and in Earth,</HI> Matth. 28.18. When he a&s;cended on High, he led Captivity Cap|tive,
<PB N="105" REF="004803_0056_100DF25B27EDD128">
and broke the Power of the Enemies of our Salvation; &s;o that they &s;hall not be able to de&s;troy &s;o much as one of tho&s;e little Ones who put their Tru&s;t in him. Here then it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that the apo&s;tate Spirits who left their fir&s;t Habitation are re|pre&s;ented in Scripture as united under one Head again&s;t Chri&s;t and his Kingdom. The <HI>Devil</HI> that old Serpent, beguiled <HI>Eve,</HI> and prevailed upon her to eat of the forbidden Fruit, and then by her enticed her Husband. We read, <HI>She took of the Fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave al&s;o unto her Husband, with her, and he did eat,</HI> Gene&s;is 3 6. And thus were our <HI>fir&s;t Parents</HI> drawn into a Rebellion again&s;t the Lord their Maker and great Benefactor, which mu&s;t have been de|&s;tructive to them and their &s;inful Progeny, had not God &s;ent his Son <HI>to de&s;troy the Works of the Devil.</HI> The fir&s;t Promi&s;e of this was given to <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> before they were ca&s;t out of the earthly Paradice, <HI>And I will put Enmity between thee and the Woman, and be|tween thy Seed and her Seed: it &s;hall brui&s;e thy Head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his Heel,</HI> Gen. 3.15. Here's a Sentence of Condemnation denounc'd again&s;t the Devil, and in the &s;ame Words a precious Promi&s;e of Deliverance made to God's People. <Q>This Seed is the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the only begotten Son of God, who was to be born of a Woman being a Virgin, by the Operation of the

Holy Gho&s;t, to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the Devil, thro' the Merit of his Death, and the Power of his Spirit, of all his Force.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dutch Annotations.</NOTE> According|ly, <HI>When the Falne&s;s of Time was come, God &s;ent forth his Son made of a Woman, made un|der the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law,</HI> Gal. 4.4, 5. And as our Lord was &s;ent to &s;ave the lo&s;t Sons and Daughters of <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;o to confound the accur&s;ed Plots and Devices of Satan, whereby he fought to en|&s;nare and ruin them forever. <HI>For a&s; much then as the Children are Partakers of Fle&s;h and Blood, be al&s;o him&s;elf likewi&s;e took part of the &s;ame: that thro' Death he might de&s;troy him that had the Power of Death, that is, the De|vil,</HI> Heb 2.14. Satan, by the divine Per|mi&s;&s;ion, has the Power of Death as an Execu|tioner. He is a Murderer, and a De&s;troyer. But now, the Son of God, having <HI>taken on him not the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of A|braham,</HI> he died on the Cro&s;s that he might <HI>condemn Sin</HI> in the Fle&s;h, which is the <HI>Sting of Death,</HI> bear the Cur&s;e of that <HI>Law</HI> which is the <HI>Strength of Sin;</HI> and &s;o purcha&s;e Recon|ciliation with God for his People, and the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, to turn Sinners from the Power of Satan unto God. And thus Satan's Kingdom, which is founded on Sin, falls to

the Ground, and his de&s;troying Power over Man, is taken away. And therefore when the Time of our Lord's Death drew nigh, he &s;aid, <HI>Now is the Judgment of this World: Now &s;hall the Prince of this Word he ca&s;t out,</HI> John 12.31. That is, <Q>My Death will be the Devil's Overthrow; will bring down Sin, and deliver the World from the Tyranny and Dominion of Satan.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Burkitt.</HI></NOTE> Our mighty Redeemer <HI>&s;poiled Principalities and Powers, and triumphed over them on the Cro&s;s,</HI> Col. 2.15. He has purcha&s;ed a glorious Victory o|ver Satan, and all our &s;piritual Enemies, Sin, this pre&s;ent evil World as under the Power the Devil, and Death. Agreably, our Lord &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>In the World ye &s;hall have Tribulation: but be of good cheer, I have over|come the World,</HI> John 16.33. We read, <HI>I will ran&s;om them from the Power of the Grave: I will redeem them from Death: O Death, I will be thy Plagues; O Grave, I will be thy De&s;truction,</HI> Ho&s;. 13.14. And then the Word of God declareth, That our Lord <HI>mu&s;t reign 'till all Enemies are put under his Feet,</HI> P&s;al. 110.1. <HI>The Lord &s;aid unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right Hand, until I make thine E|nemies thy Foot&s;tool.</HI> And now the <HI>Father hath committed all Judgment to the Son.</HI> He

is the Judge, Lawgiver, and King of his Peo|ple; and as the Lord &s;trong and mighty will he go on conquering and to conquer his and his People's Enemies, 'till they &s;hall be all put under him; and his People al&s;o &s;hall have Dominion over them, in the great Day of Judgment.</P>
<P>Which leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3">3. We may under&s;tand it <HI>of the la&s;t and general Judgment, when our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall appear in the Glory of his Father, to judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>We read, <HI>He bath appointed a Day, in the which he will judge the World in Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given A&s;&s;urance unto all Men, in that he hath rai&s;ed him from the Dead,</HI> Acts 17.31.

But we do not as yet &s;ee all Things put under him, as they &s;hall be in the great Day. <HI>Satan</HI> is &s;till obeyed as the God of this World, and works in the Hearts of the Children of Di&s;|obedience. <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI>'s Reign has not a Pe|riod put unto it.

and his Angels,</HI> Matth. 25.41. Sinners have &s;ometimes &s;uch a Conviction of this Judgment as makes them al&s;o tremble.

<P>I. The Spirit of God convinceth Men of Judgment by <HI>the miraculous Power given to the Apo&s;tles to ca&s;t out Devils in the Name of Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>While our Lord was on Earth, he exerci|&s;ed this Power. He went about doing good, and <HI>healing all that were oppre&s;&s;ed of the Devil,</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="004803_0059_100DF2623408D4D0">
Acts 10.38. He ca&s;t down Satan, and healed many that were under a bodily Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Thus our Lord ca&s;t many De|vils out of a mi&s;erable Man in the Country of the <HI>Gaderenes,</HI> Luke 8.30. <HI>Je&s;us asked him, &s;aying, What is thy Name? And he &s;aid Legion: becau&s;e many Devils were entred into him.</HI> But at Chri&s;t's Command they were di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, 33 <HI>v. Then went the Devils out of the Man.</HI> And when the <HI>Seventy</HI> returned, they &s;aid, Lord even the Devils are &s;ubject to us thro' thy Name. Upon which our Lord &s;ays, <HI>I beheld Satan as Lightning fall from Heaven.</HI> Luke 10.18. And after our Saviour Chri&s;t was exalted, this Power was wonderfully manife&s;ted by the Hands of the Apo&s;tles in the Name of Je&s;us. They bro't them which were <HI>vexed with unclean Spirits, and they were healed every one,</HI> Acts 5.16. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid to the evil Spirit that had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a Per&s;on as a Spirit of Divination; <HI>I com|mand thee in the Name of Je&s;us to come out of her. And he came out the &s;ame Hour,</HI> Act. 16.18. Now the great Agent in this miraculous Work was the Spirit of God, <HI>Matth.</HI> 12.28.

Satan's King|dom is founded on the Darkne&s;s of Sin, and &s;up|porred by Ignorance and Error. Accordingly, The Holy Spirit u&s;eth the Light of his Word to &s;ubdue him. Thus our Lord &s;aid to <HI>Paul, I have appeared unto thee for this Pur|po&s;e, to make thee a Mini&s;ter and a Witne&s;s both of the&s;e Things which thou ha&s;t &s;een, and of tho&s;e Things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the People, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I &s;end thee, To open their Eyes, and to turn them from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God,</HI> Acts 26.16,&mdash;18. Now it is the Spirit of God who furni&s;heth and &s;ends forth the&s;e Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to &s;hew Men the mi&s;erable Bondage they are under to Satan, and to invite them to come over to Chri&s;t, whom God hath &s;et <HI>for an En&s;ign of the People,</HI> I&s;a. 11.10. Our Lord while on Earth was anointed by the Spirit to preach Deliverance to the Captives.

Thus Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters who are as their Brethren, form'd out of the Clay, hold up the Light of the Go&s;pel, and cry a|loud as they are directed; and when the almighty Spirit is plea&s;ed to work with and by them, the Powers of Darkne&s;s flee be|fore them, as the Shades of Night are cha|&s;ed away before the &s;pringing Day, and ri|&s;ing Sun.

<P>And may our Lord utterly <HI>de&s;troy Anti|chri&s;t</HI> by the Brightness of his Coming! May He <HI>bind Satan,</HI> and ca&s;t him into the bottom|le&s;s Pit! And may that Voice be heard, &s;ay|ing, <HI>The Kingdoms of this World are be|come the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t, and he &s;hall reign forever and ever. Amen, Even &s;o, Come</HI> LORD JESUS.</P>
