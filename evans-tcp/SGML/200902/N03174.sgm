<P>_I Ob&s;erve, in an Ordination Sermon Preached at <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> about two year ago, a Lamentation made, that we have &s;ew or no &s;tated and known Rules of Di&s;cipline in our Churches. This is al&s;o &s;aid to have been the Lamentation of a worthy Divine lately decea&s;ed there. How general this Lamentation is, I know not; nor do I know any ground at all for it. I thought we had not been without &s;uch Rules, &s;ince we have Bibles; how regard|le&s;s &s;oever we be, as to practical conformity to
<PB N="2" REF="003838_0002_100262BF5925B6B0">them. I &s;uppo&s;e we are not by profe&s;&s;ion, Ro|man Catholicks: if we be, the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> has provided us with Rules. But if we be Pro|te&s;tants, it &s;eems as if we &s;hould own no other than the LORD to be our Law-giver, as <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 33.22. that he has made full provi&s;ion for us, has given us his Law and Te&s;timony, according to which we mu&s;t ever &s;peak and act, as in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 8 20. Has therein provided a thorough furniture for the Man of God, as 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16, 17. Nor has CHRIST directed his Mini&s;ters to teach the Peo|ple any other Rules than what are therein con|tained, as in <HI>Mat</HI> 28.20. I had thought that the Legi&s;lative Power had been lodged intirely in CHRIST our Law-giver as well as Judge; that Mini&s;ters, Churches, Councils, &amp;c. had nothing to do to make Rules for Government or Di&s;ci|pline; but were ever to keep clo&s;e to the Rules that CHRIST has made for us. If he has pro|vided a thorough furniture for the Man of God, what has he left for us to do? Can we mend his Work, make his furniture &s;till more thorough? Did he not know the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the&s;e Churches when he gave his Laws? Has he ac|cordingly appointed us to &s;uit Laws for our pre|&s;ent Circum&s;tances? In Civil Government in|deed, Ordinances of Men are to be made and obeyed, as 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.13. But where is a word of any &s;uch allowance in the Church of CHRIST? It &s;eems as if our bla&s;phemous Pride, leads us to a conceit that we can perfect his Laws, whenas in|deed we have nothing to do but to learn them,
<PB N="3" REF="003838_0003_100262C0F6C8DB48">govern by them and obey them. If indeed we differ in &s;entiment about the meaning of the&s;e Laws or Rules, or are at a lo&s;s as to the applica|tion of them, in matters of importance, we have the light of Nature and Scripture both directing us to apply for light to Councils, who&s;e work it is, not dogmatically to determine Ca&s;es (as has been of late the way) but them&s;elves to &s;eek for Light by Prayer and other means, and having them&s;elves obtained Light, to lay it before them that &s;end for them. <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> But what if they will not receive Light when offered to them? <HI>An&s;w.</HI> The way in that Ca&s;e is plain: Means mu&s;t be u&s;ed with them, and Patience exerci&s;ed toward them; and if yet they will not be in|formed till their &s;in ari&s;e to Here&s;y or Scandal, CHRIST plainly tells us what is to be done with them, whether they be particular Per&s;ons, or whole Churches, in 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 3.6, 14. &amp; <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.10.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> But what if Chri&s;tians be uncertain whether what they have again&s;t their Mini&s;ters or others, amount to Scandal or no; may they not &s;end for Councils, and, having raked up what they can again&s;t them, lay it before the Council, that they may &s;ee whether it may not amount to Scandal?</P>

<ITEM>(1) This is indeed the late way, and is expre&s;ly cro&s;s to <HI>Lev.</HI> 19.16. And no way agrees with the di&s;po&s;ition of a citizen of <HI>Zion,</HI> in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 15.3.</ITEM>
<PB N="4" REF="003838_0004_100262C4B5DA25E8">
<ITEM>(2) In ca&s;e of uncertainty as to what amounts to Scandal, Councils may be called to &s;earch for Light, whereby to determine the ca&s;e, without throwing reproaches on any that are &s;u&s;pected to have done what amounts thereto. Can't a ca&s;e be &s;uppo&s;ed and determined without an an|ti&s;criptural application of it to any particular per&s;on?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>It is wonderful to &s;ee what pleas are made a|bout the Platform, in a late Print called <HI>New-England's</HI> Lamentations. There be indeed good things in it; particularly, what is judiciou&s;ly &s;aid of the pernicious Principles of the Arminians. But how very exceptionable are many things in it? For in&s;tance, in Page 35, that the Churches may choo&s;e Ruling Elders, in oppo&s;ition to their Pa&s;tors judgments. If &s;o, tho&s;e Words are, no doubt, to be inverted in <HI>Heb.</HI> 15.17. So in pa. 42, about a Mini&s;ter's promi&s;e before Settlement, which certainly can never be made by any that have the exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience; for who can with &s;afety, promi&s;e to govern ac|cording to the Platform, whenas its not unlike|ly, that after a time he may find things in it that to him appear, in no wi&s;e to agree with the holy Oracles. In that ca&s;e certainly that word mu&s;t take place in Acts 5.29 <HI>We ought to obey God, rather than man</HI> Again, as to what is called the Third way of Communion: if I under&s;tand what is intended by it; there appears no Scrip|ture warrant therefor. When ever a Church
<PB N="5" REF="003838_0005_100262C867DFB3E0">comes to be evidently Heretical or Scandalous, there needs no Councils or Synods in that Ca&s;e. The Churches are bound in duty, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> to deny Communion with them, according to that plain and &s;olemnly expre&s;&s;ed precept, in 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 3.6. without waiting for the interpo&s;ition of any Council or Synod, what is &s;aid in the Platform notwith&s;tanding, tho' the Compo&s;ers of it are readily acknowleged to have been wi&s;e and holy Per&s;ons. Nor do I object again&s;t Synods ex|pre&s;&s;ing in a Platform, their pre&s;ent Sentiments as to the Scripture way of Church Di&s;cipline; yet certainly none may impo&s;e the&s;e Sentiments on the Con&s;ciences of others as if binding to them. Indeed, &s;o far as appears, hardly any one Church ever complied fully with the Platform; but varied, &s;ome in one thing, &s;ome in another, &s;ome in many, according (as is in Charity to be &s;up|po&s;ed) as they apprehended the Platform to vary from the Scripture.</P>
<P>Whatever Pleas are made for any Platform, or Synodical determination, if we be indeed Pro|te&s;tants we mu&s;t ever appeal to the Law and Te&s;timony, as in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 8.20 as our only Rule in the concernments of Religion. It was the <HI>Be|reans</HI> duty, not to take the Sermons even of the Apo&s;tles upon tru&s;t, but mu&s;t &s;earch the Scrip|ture, as the Touch&s;tone by which to try them, as in <HI>Acts</HI> 17.11. and it is evidently ours al&s;o, both as to the Preaching of Mini&s;ters, and Deter|minations of Synods, Councils, <HI>&amp;c</HI> And every
<PB N="6" REF="003838_0006_100262CBF8A4DEA8">Chri&s;tian mu&s;t be allowed to make a Judgment for him&s;elf, whether that be Scriptural which is &s;aid by others &s;o to be. Nor need there be dif|ficulty in variety of &s;entiments about the mean|ing of Scripture, while we exerci&s;e the Charity required in <HI>Rom</HI> 14.1 and <HI>Col.</HI> 3.12, 13.</P>
<P>What appears in a late Print of <HI>Octob.</HI> 21. 1734. concerning a <HI>Salem</HI> Pa&s;tor, and Councils on the Ca&s;e, is &s;urprizing. Where there is and long has been a Po&s;itive Charge made by no le&s;s than three neighbouring Pa&s;tors, of gro&s;s ini|quity, as Lying, Fornication, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the <HI>Pocheh</HI> Church; the Mini&s;ters, in conformity to the An|tichri&s;tian <HI>Pecheh</HI> A&s;&s;embly, will by no means regard it. No, they &s;ay, they are willingly ig|norant, are at too great a di&s;tance. Yea, in their general Convention, have declared, that they cannot look on them&s;elves proper Judges; and yet contradictorily, in practice &s;ay the quite con|trary; for they judge the Ca&s;e, and determine that Church innocent, by their communicating with them in &s;pecial Ordinances, as they have opportunity. But as to other Churches (as <HI>Sandwich</HI> and <HI>Salem</HI>) where nothing of Scandal <HI>appears</HI> in the Pa&s;tors, abundance of Pains is taken, by Councils upon Councils, to find out &s;omething to fa&s;ten on them; whenas its evident that neither Councils nor Churches have any thing to do with sinful actions in Mini&s;ters (or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> either) unle&s;s they amount to Scandalous Iniquty, and that proved too, as in <HI>Deut.</HI> 19.15.
<PB N="7" REF="003838_0007_100262CE7039DB10">What have they to do with humane infirmities, &s;ince we read as in <HI>Jam.</HI> 3.2. <HI>Ecel.</HI> 7.20. and <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.12. If &s;uch Sins were publickly in an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick way to be animadverted on, there would be no time to &s;pare from Church dealings and Councils animadver&s;ions from Age to Age.</P>
<P>It's doubtle&s;s evident, as the Sun at noon, that a Pa&s;tor may certainly know of many &s;inful in|firmities in &s;ome of the Members of his Church; yea, have abundant ground for fears and jea|lou&s;ies of &s;candalous Sin practiced by them, yet unle&s;s he has proof may in no wi&s;e publi&s;h them; nor then neither, unle&s;s tho&s;e feared Sins amount to what is &s;candalous; nor yet then, unle&s;s the Per&s;ons can't be brought to Repentance by more private means. Much le&s;s may Elders be &s;o dealt withal, as is evident from that &s;pecial guard on their names, in 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.19. And how inexcu&s;a|ble then are Councils, harping on their fears and jealou&s;ies of which they &s;peak in their Print, without any proof, and in direct oppo&s;ition to that Precept in <HI>Lev.</HI> 19.16.</P>
<P>If Scandal has been given, in the <HI>Salem</HI> ca&s;e, (nothing of which appears) as much has been offered in the Propo&s;als, as any Chri&s;tians can Scripturally de&s;ire. On that &s;uppo&s;ition, Satis|faction and Compen&s;ation are plumply offered. Yea, the Pa&s;tor declares that he has ever &s;tood ready therefore. Nor is there a word objected again&s;t the Truth of this his Declaration. And
<PB N="8" REF="003838_0008_100262D045623068">what occa&s;ion then for &s;uch numbers of Councils of numerous Churches in them on the Ca&s;e!</P>
<P>Who would ever have imagined, that the meaning of tho&s;e words in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.22. was, that Mini&s;ters &s;hould make publick Confe&s;&s;ions of their humane frailties, had not <HI>Seventeen</HI> Chur|ches given that as the Expo&s;ition of them! But I have done, only adding, that I verily believe that the eminently great Cau&s;es of the&s;e &s;trange wanderings in the Churches, is want of deep, &s;olemn and frequent pondering on, and begging for in&s;ight into tho&s;e Holy Oracles, which are appointed to be as a Lamp to our Feet, and a Light to our Paths, and accordingly to be medi|tated in both Day and Night; and that from hence it is that &s;ome are countenanced in the Mini&s;try, whom the Scripture plainly forbids to meddle with it; others rightfully in it, reviled in oppo&s;ition to plain Divine Commands; with other evils, too many to be enumerated, though greatly to be lamented.</P>
