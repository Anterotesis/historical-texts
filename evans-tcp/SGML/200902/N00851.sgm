<P>THE Gracious Pre&s;ence of GOD with His People is the foun|dation of their happine&s;s; it is from thence that they are provided for, that they are protected, that they are healed, and that they do enjoy liberty: this is that which makes them multiply, and makes them rich and victorious. And the taking away of the
<PB N="4" REF="001026_0003_0FAEF17487D30570">Pre&s;ence of God, opens a door to a|bundance of mi&s;ery. Ho&s;. 9.12. <HI>And woe al&s;o unto them, when I &s;hall depart from them.</HI> Deut. 31.17. <HI>Are not the&s;e evils come up|on us, becau&s;e our God is not amongst us?</HI> This is that which God threatens here. Both <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were grown very Corrupt, and here God doth denounce His wrath again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Where mind;</P>
<P N="1">1. The Evil threatned, <HI>I will go and return to my place:</HI> there is another ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame importance, ver. 6. <HI>He hath withdrawn him&s;elf from them.</HI> The phra&s;e is figurative; as if He &s;hould &s;ay, I will &s;hut up my &s;elf in Heaven, and not come near you, to help you: I will ab&s;ent my &s;elf and leave you de&s;ti|tute of my pre&s;ence.</P>
<P N="2">2. The continuance of this, <HI>Till they acknowledge their Offence.</HI> Hebr. <HI>Till they be Guilty.</HI> They were guilty already, God charges a great deal of guilt upon them: but the meaning is, till they own their Guilt. Their Sin here is called their Offence: &s;ometimes Sin is called Evil; being denominated from the nature of
<PB N="5" REF="001026_0004_0FAEF175953C37E0">it. There is no goodne&s;s in Sin, it is of an evil nature. Sometimes it is called Iniquity, becau&s;e it is contrary to Equity; there is unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and inequality in it. Sometimes it is called Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion, becau&s;e contrary to the Law. When men &s;in, they tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds that God has &s;et them. Here it is called Offence, becau&s;e it is provoking and of|fen&s;ive to God, this is that which they mu&s;t acknowledge, they mu&s;t neither deny their &s;ins, nor ju&s;tify, or excu&s;e their &s;in, but acknowledge them, and make confe&s;&s;ion of them.</P>

<Q>God will not be Reconciled to His pro|fe&s;&s;ing People, till they acknowledge their Offences.</Q>
<P>Many times a Corrupt people that have provoked God, are very backward to ownf their Offences. Many times in&s;tead of acknowledging them, they are ju&s;tifying of them, and that under two notions; Either as matter of liberty or duty. Or, if they do not ju&s;tify them, yet they ex|cu&s;e them: they find many con&s;iderati|ons
<PB N="6" REF="001026_0005_0FAEF17866EDCE18">to alleviate their Guilt; but God will not be reconciled unto them, till they acknowledge their Offences. When they have offended God, it is very fair and rea&s;onable that they &s;hould acknowledge it. &amp; God will make them do &s;o before he Pardons them. There may be &s;ome inter|mi&s;&s;ion of wrath &amp; ce&s;&s;ation of judgment, though they don't, but He will not be re<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">iled till they do. God is not back|ward to be reconciled to His People, that have wronged him, but yet he ex|pects this: Jer. 3.12, 13. <HI>Only aknow|ledge thine offence.</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t. 1. <HI>What offences mu&s;t they acknow|ledge?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The offences of the Land. Not all the offences that are in the Land: many offences are &s;ecret &amp; they cannot acknow|ledge them, &s;ome offences only being per|&s;onal guilt but the offences of the Land, that the People and Countrey are guilty of, are to be acknowledged by them. So in the <HI>Text,</HI> they &s;hall acknowledge <HI>Their</HI> offence. And there be many &s;ins that the Land are guilty of, which mu&s;t be owned.</P>

<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="001026_0006_0FAEF179EEAFA518">
1. <HI>Such prevailing &s;ins as do not fall under the cognizance of Authority.</HI> When ever a people do manife&s;t a Corrupt departed heart, an heart gone away from God; they break Covenant and are guilty: and this they may do when their carriages are not Criminal before men, nor Scandalous, as when they do not &s;avour of a gracious, humble, believing &s;pirit; but they &s;avour much of vanity, worldline&s;s, pride and unbelief; this is ju&s;tly offen&s;ive to God. Mat. 16.23. <HI>Thou &s;avourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</HI> The Land becomes <HI>Guilty</HI> thereby.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such &s;ins that have got &s;uch head, that Authority cannot &s;uppre&s;s them.</HI> Sometimes &s;ins get &s;uch head, that it is quite beyond Authority to &s;uppre&s;s them; the ordi|nary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice is not &s;ufficient to &s;uppre&s;s them: people are got beyond the re&s;traints of Authority, they are &s;o over run with wickedne&s;s, that it is quite beyond the power of Rulers to reduce them; they ri&s;e up again&s;t their Rulers. In this ca&s;e, God imputes <HI>Iniquity</HI> to the Land, &amp; takes the ca&s;e into his own hand, He judges and puni&s;hes them him&s;elf, as <HI>Hum.</HI> 14.10. <HI>Num.</HI> 16.2, 3.</P>

3. <HI>Such &s;ins as are not duly witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t.</HI> Sometimes there is a great deal of <HI>Iniquity</HI> in the Land, and yet there is little te&s;ti|mony born again&s;t it; tho&s;e that know the thing will not complain: they will talk of it, and bla&s;t the names of others; but don<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ke care that the thing may be puni&s;hed. If they know a thing in a man that they are angry with, they will complain: but, if he be a Friend, they won't. Sometimes the man is above them, and they are afraid to do it; &s;ometimes the man knows as much by them, and they dare not. In this ca&s;e, the &s;in be|comes the &s;in of the Land. So if there be complaint, and Rulers don't bear a te&s;ti|mony; <HI>Deut.</HI> 13.5. Rev. 2.20. <HI>I have a few things again&s;t thee, becau&s;e thou &s;uffere&s;t that woman</HI> Jezabel.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The &s;ins of Rulers.</HI> When tho&s;e that are in Supream power, carry them|&s;elves corruptly, it is not only their &s;in, but the &s;in of the Land. A people is con|&s;idered as a Body politick, they are <HI>Joint|ly</HI> in Covenant with God; and the Sins of Rulers makes the Land <HI>Guilty.</HI> Saul'<HI>s &s;laying of the</HI> Gebeonites <HI>brought a Famine upon</HI> I&s;rael. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 21. David<HI>'s Sin brought</HI>

If Rulers do acts of inju&s;tice, carry <HI>Proudly,</HI> or <HI>Prophanely,</HI> it is imputed to the Land: and the Land &s;uffers on that account. If other men don't approve of the thing, or connive at it, but in their places witne&s;s again&s;t it, yet the Land is <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t. 2. <HI>Who mu&s;t acknowledge the Sins of the Land?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. The Rulers. As long as the Rulers carry <HI>Badly,</HI> God will not be re|conciled to the Countrey. God doth expect that they &s;hould acknowledge their own iniquities, and the iniquities of the Countrey; if they do ju&s;tify or ex|cu&s;e the &s;ins of the Countrey, no won|der if others do follow their example. However, their impenitency will be imputed; though they be great men, yet it is not beneath them to acknowledge the Sins of the Land: they won't be ex|cu&s;ed, becau&s;e of their &s;tate and great|ne&s;s. Acknowledging of iniquity is not the work of the common People only, but the work of principal Rulers. <HI>David</HI> did &s;o, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.10. &s;o did the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Nineve, Jon.</HI> 3.6, 7, 8. &s;o did <HI>Jo&s;iah;</HI> and
<PB N="10" REF="001026_0009_0FAEF17B50878D58">the contrary carriage in <HI>Zedekiah,</HI> did greatly provoke God. Jer. 36.24. <HI>Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the King, nor any of his Servants, that heard all the&s;e words.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Body of the People.</HI> It is not ex|pected by God, that every one of the people &s;hould acknowledge there offence; It is a rare ca&s;e, but that there be &s;ome perver&s;e people, which will not be &s;en|&s;ible of the provocations of the Land; but the body of the people mu&s;t do it. If the generality of the people be ob&s;tinate, &amp; &s;tand in the ju&s;tification of them&s;elves, the anger of God will continue; God ex|pects that there &s;hould be a general ac|knowledgment of their offence. Com|monly there be &s;ome mourners that are lamenting and bewailing the &s;ins of the Land, and they &s;hall procure mercy for them&s;elves. Ezek. 9.4. <HI>Set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that Sigh and that Cry for all the abominations, that are done in the mid&s;t thereof.</HI> But in order to re|conciliation, there mu&s;t be a general ac|knowledgment of the offence. Judg. 10.10. <HI>The Children of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>Cryed unto the Lord, &s;aying, we have Sinned, &amp;c.</HI></P>

Que&s;t. 3 <HI>How mu&s;t they acknowledge their Offence?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. They mu&s;t acknowledge &s;ome things in <HI>General</HI> and &s;ome in <HI>Particular.</HI> The things that provoke God are of two &s;orts; &s;ometimes it is a cour&s;e of <HI>Ini|quity:</HI> &s;o a way of Pride, Voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s, or Super&s;tition; and then the things are to be acknowledged in the general; it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cend to all particu|lar acts; but it is fit it &s;hould be done as particularly, as the thing will admit. Dan. 9.5, 6. <HI>We have Sinned, and com|mitted Iniquity, and have Rebelled, neither have we hearkned to thy Servants the Pro|phets, &amp;c.</HI> Sometimes the provocation is &s;ome particular evil; as the making of the Golden <HI>Calf,</HI> the iniquity of <HI>Peor, Davids</HI> numbring of the people: and in this ca&s;e, things &s;hould be acknowledged particularly; &s;o did <HI>David,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.10</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They mu&s;t acknowledge them to God, and &s;ometimes to Men.</HI> They are to be acknowledged before God in Prayer; they mu&s;t come before God, and &s;pread their iniquities in a way of <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion;</HI> they mu&s;t fall down before God as <HI>Guilty.</HI> P&s;al.
<PB N="12" REF="001026_0011_0FAEF17CD5BFF288">32.5. <HI>I acknowledged my Sin unto thee.</HI> Publick &s;ins &s;hould be confe&s;&s;ed Publickly. And many times al&s;o they &s;hould be Confe&s;&s;ed unto men; as there is occa&s;i|on; &s;ometimes men do expo&s;tulate par|ticularly with others, and tell them of their &s;ins; and then they &s;hould be ready to acknowledge them 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.13 <HI>And</HI> Da|vid <HI>&s;aid unto</HI> Nathan, <HI>I have &s;inned again&s;t the Lord.</HI> They may not &s;tand in their ju&s;tification, and plead for their &s;in. So many times, there is occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e of &s;uch practi&s;es, and then men &s;hould te&s;tify again&s;t them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They mu&s;t acknowledge them with Grief and Shame.</HI> Sometimes though men do acknowledge their &s;ins, yet they have a &s;tupid Spirit, and are in&s;en&s;ible of their vilene&s;s: this is very offen&s;ive to God; He won't turn away from his Anger when it is thus. Jer. 3.3. <HI>Thou refu&s;e&s;t to be a&s;ha|med.</HI> Jer. 6.15. <HI>Were they a&s;hamed, when they had committed Abomination? Nay they were not at all a&s;hamed, neither could they blu&s;h.</HI> So God expects they &s;hould be &s;orry for their &s;in. P&s;al. 38.18. <HI>I will be &s;orry for my Sin.</HI> But when men don't lay the thing to heart, are not &s;en&s;ible what they have
<PB N="13" REF="001026_0012_0FAEF17DCD164BC8">done, the thing don't lie upon their hearts; Gods Anger will not be turned away. Their repentance mu&s;t be at lea&s;t vi&s;ibly &s;incere repentance: when there is plain apparent mockery in their repentance &amp; acknowledgments, Gods Anger will not be turned away from them.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 4. <HI>Why mu&s;t they acknowledge their Offences, in order to Reconciliation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. Till they acknowledge their <HI>Offences,</HI> they will not ju&s;tify God in His <HI>Judgments.</HI> When people do in their hearts acknowledge their iniquities, they are under advantages to &s;ee the Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of God in His proceedings a|gain&s;t them. Exod. 9.27. <HI>The Lord is Righteous, and Land my People are wicked.</HI> But if they do not acknowledge their &s;ins, no wonder if they murmure, and impute hard dealings to God, and think that God deals very rigidly with them. Men will be apt to lay the fault of judgments upon God, and not take it to them&s;elves. I&s;a. 58.3. <HI>Wherefore have we fasted, and thou &s;ee&s;t us not? Wherefore have we af|flicted our Souls, and thou take&s;t no know|ledge?</HI> They will wonder at the &s;everity of God, at lea&s;t they won't &s;ee how much
<PB N="14" REF="001026_0013_0FAEF17E461EA680">cau&s;e they have to ju&s;tify God. If they &s;ee it is righteou&s;s that they &s;hould be afflicted upon the account of &s;ome other things, that they do own, vet they don't &s;ee what abundant cau&s;e they have given God to be angry with them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Till they do this, there is no hope of their Reformation.</HI> Men mu&s;t reform their iniquities, before Gods anger do turn a|way. I&s;a. 9.12, 13. <HI>For all this, His anger is not turned away, but his Hand is &s;tretch|ed out &s;till: For the people turneth not to Him that &s;miteth them.</HI> While &s;in is not reformed, the cau&s;e of judgment does continue: the Breach cannot be made up, while they walk in wayes of prova|cation; and this they will do, till they do acknowledge their offence. A particular per&s;on may reform, though he does not acknowledge his &s;in, he may do it from a &s;pirit of compliance, he is loth to make trouble, and grieve others, or becau&s;e his temptation is changed, now he is Mar|ried; or grown Old, and don't de&s;ire to do as formerly he did, or becau&s;e he is convinced that it is a &s;in, yet is a&s;hamed to confe&s;s it; but ordinarily there is no hope of bringing a Land to reformation,
<PB N="15" REF="001026_0014_0FAEF1817B4D6580">if they do not acknowledge their iniqui|ties: acknowledging goes before for&s;a|king. Prov. 28.13. <HI>He that Confe&s;&s;eth and For&s;aketh &s;hall find mercy.</HI></P>

<P><HI>See hence, it is a very hard thing for a Corrupt People to be reconciled unto God.</HI> When once there is a breach made be|tween God and his People, it is a diffi|cult thing to have it made up. Some|times they &s;uffer abundance, before the the thing is taken up; they are under frowning di&s;pen&s;ations for &s;everal Gene|rations.

But they are very backward to own their faults: &s;ome|times they are re&s;train'd a little, and held in by Civil Authority, but they are not throughly convinced, nor heartily acknowledge their offences: Sometimes they are re&s;trained by the Judgments of God, and appearances of Anger; but they don't acknowledge their offences: if there be &s;ome reformation, it is a forced thing, as 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 34 32.
