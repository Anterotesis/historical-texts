<HEAD>THE DEATH OF POOR JACK.</HEAD>

<L>POOR Jack, who&s;e gay heart kept his &s;pirits aloft,</L>
<L>And ever gave mirth its full due,</L>
<L>Who &s;adne&s;s de&s;pi&s;ed, nor to grief was &s;o &s;oft,</L>

<L>Having weather'd the tempe&s;ts of ocean and fate,</L>

<L>Ha&s;tened home to his Poll, with his true-hearted mate,</L>
<L>To be laid up in plea&s;ure's &s;nug tier.</L>
<L>With a good &s;tore of &s;hiners his che&s;t was &s;upply'd,</L>

"As how that, they hop'd he'd not double Cape Horn,</L>

<L>And thunder roll'd over his head:</L>

<L>Blue lightning fla&s;h'd around him, the kind victim fell,</L>
<L>His &s;oul fled to death's calm retreat.</L>
<L>The cherub, who ever to virtue is near,</L>
<L>Bore it hence through a clear lucid track;</L>

<BYLINE>Sung by Mr. Owen&s;on.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>YE &s;ons of Hibernia, who &s;nug on dry land,</L>
<L>Round your &s;moaking turf fires and whi&s;key in hand,</L>
<L>Drink kid-milk full rough, and ne'er think on the boys,</L>
<L>Who are fighting your battles thro' tempe&s;t and noi&s;e,</L>
<L>Attend to my ditty 'tis true I declare,</L>
<L>Such &s;wimming and &s;inking would make you all &s;tare</L>
<L>For &s;torms, &s;quibs and crackers have &s;ing'd at my tail</L>
<L>Since the pre&s;s-gang laid hold of poor Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas the fir&s;t of April, I &s;et off, like a fool,</L>
<L>From Kilkenny to Dublin to &s;ee Laurence Tool,</L>
<L>My mother's third cou&s;in, who oft' had wrote down,</L>
<L>And begg'd I'd come &s;ee how he flouri&s;h'd in town,</L>
<L>But I &s;carce had &s;et foot in this terrible place,</L>
<L>'Ere I met with a &s;harper who &s;wore to my face,</L>
<L>He beckon'd a pre&s;s-gang, that came without fail,</L>
<L>And neck and heels dragg'd off poor Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then they &s;campered away as they &s;aid with a prize</L>
<L>(For they thought me a &s;ailor and off in di&s;gui&s;e).</L>
<L>But a terrible blunder they made with their &s;trife,</L>
<L>For I'd ne'er &s;een a &s;hip or the &s;ea in my life:</L>
<L>Away to a tender they told me to &s;teer,</L>
<L>But of tenderne&s;s devil a mor&s;el was there:</L>
<L>O I roar'd and I cur&s;t, tho' it did not avail,</L>
<L>They down in the cellar cram'd Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We &s;et &s;ail from Dublin the very next day,</L>
<L>I was half &s;tarved and &s;ea-&s;ick the re&s;t of the way;</L>
<L>Not a mile-&s;tone I &s;aw, nor a hou&s;e, nor a bed,</L>
<L>'Twas all water and &s;ky 'till we came to Spithead:</L>
<L>Then they called up all hands&mdash;hands and feet &s;oon obey'd,</L>
<L>O I wi&s;h'd my&s;elf home cutting turf with a &s;pade,</L>
<L>For the fir&s;t thing I faw made my courage to fail,</L>
<L>Ws a large floating ca&s;tle for Patrick O'Neal.</L>

<L>This huge wooden world roll'd about on the tide,</L>
<L>And a large row of teeth &s;tuck fa&s;t in each &s;ide,</L>
<L>They put out the boat and told me to keep</L>
<L>Fa&s;t hold with my trotters for fear I &s;hould &s;lip:</L>
<L>I let go with my hands to &s;tick fa&s;t by my toes,</L>
<L>The &s;hip gave a roll, and away my head goes,</L>
<L>I plung'd in the water and da&s;h'd like a whale,</L>
<L>'Till with boat-hooks they fi&s;h'd up poor Patrick O'Neal,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Mid&s;t &s;houts je&s;ts and laughter they hoi&s;ted me in</L>
<L>To this huge wooden world full of riot and din;</L>
<L>Such ropes and &s;uch pullies, &s;uch &s;ights met my eye,</L>
<L>And &s;o large were the &s;heets that hung up to dry:</L>
<L>I thought it Noah's Ark &s;tuff d full of queer gue&s;ts,</L>
<L>Hogs, pedlers, gee&s;e, &s;ailors, and all other bea&s;ts;</L>
<L>Some drank bladders of gin, others pitchers of ale,</L>
<L>And they &s;ung, cur&s;t and laugh'd at poor Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All confounded with bother they began to look queer,</L>
<L>When the boat&s;wain's &s;hrill pipe made all hands to appear,</L>
<L>Up the ropes like to monkeys they running did &s;wear</L>
<L>Then like gibbets and rope-dancers &s;wung in the air,</L>
<L>They clap'd &s;ticks in her cap&s;tern, (as I afterwards found)</L>
<L>The chap &s;it and fif'd as they turned it round,</L>
<L>The &s;hip run her anchor, &s;pread her wings and &s;et fail,</L>
<L>with a freight of live lumber and Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then to go down below I expre&s;s'd a great wi&s;h,</L>
<L>Where they live under water like &s;o many fi&s;h;</L>
<L>I was put in a me&s;s with &s;ome more of the crew;</L>
<L>And it being banjon-day they gave me burgue;</L>
<L>For a bed they'd a &s;ack hung as high as my chin,</L>
<L>They call'd it a hammock and bade me get in;</L>
<L>I lay hold, took a leap, but my footing being frail,</L>
<L>It &s;wang me clean over!&mdash;poor Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With &s;ome help I got in, where I rocked all night,</L>
<L>The day broke my re&s;t in a terrible fright,</L>
<L>Up hammocks, down che&s;ts, was cry'd from all parts</L>
<L>'There's a French &s;hip in &s;ight,' up and down went my heart:</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="032039_0015_0FF0FDF1712CA750">
To a gun I was &s;tationed, they cryed with an oath,</L>
<L>To pull off his breeches, unmuzzle his mouth,</L>
<L>They took off the apron that covered his tail,</L>
<L>And the leading-&s;trings gave unto Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our thick window &s;hutters we pulled up with &s;peed</L>
<L>And we run out our bull dogs of true Engli&s;h breed,</L>
<L>The captain cried 'England and Ireland my boys!'</L>
<L>When he mentioned old Ireland my heart made a noi&s;e;</L>
<L>Our &s;weet little guns did the Frenchmen defy,</L>
<L>We clap'd fire on his back and bid him let fly,</L>
<L>His voice made me leap, tho' I'd hold by his tail,</L>
<L>The bea&s;t then flew back and threw Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then we leather'd away, by my &s;oul, hob and nob,</L>
<L>'Till the Frenchmen gave up what they thought a bad job,</L>
<L>Then to tye him behind a long cord they did bring,</L>
<L>And we led him along like a pig in a &s;tring:</L>
<L>So home to old England we led the French boy,</L>
<L>O the &s;ight of the land made me &s;ea-&s;ick with joy,</L>
<L>They made a new peace when the war was too &s;tale,</L>
<L>And &s;et all hands adrift and poor Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now &s;afe on dry land a carou&s;ing I'll &s;tear,</L>
<L>Nor cat-head, nor cat-block, nor boat&s;wain's cat-fear;</L>
<L>While there's a &s;hot in the locker I'll &s;ing dance my round:</L>
<L>And Saturday night &s;hall la&s;t all the year round:</L>
<L>But &s;hould peace grow too &s;leepy and war come again</L>
<L>Returning I'll bring you good folks, a fre&s;h tale,</L>
