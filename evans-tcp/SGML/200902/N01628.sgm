<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P>WHat I briefly offer in the following Pages, I was moved to by the Reverend Mr. <HI>George Corwin,</HI> late Mini&s;ter of <HI>Salem.</HI> He liv'd greatly and ju&s;tly beloved and de&s;ired, and I think died as much lamented. He was an Able, Faithful, Laborious Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel; and a lover of Souls, and I believe is now gone to his Everla&s;ting Rest. When he was last in Town a few Months ago; he de&s;ired me to write &s;ome &s;hort thing, to &s;how that <HI>Per&s;ons &s;hould &s;eek Bapti&s;m for them&s;elves &amp; Children; &amp; that Baptiz'd Per&s;ons when grown up, &s;hould renew their Covenant with God.</HI> He de&s;ir'd (if I Remember right) that what &s;hould be written might be <HI>adapted to the Capacity of the meane&s;t;</HI> and might be <HI>Short</HI> al&s;o, that &s;o it might be the more <HI>ea&s;ily bought, and charitably di&s;tributed,</HI> where it might probably do good. If he had not died &s;o &s;oon, I believe I &s;hould &s;carce have begun to write &s;o &s;oon as I have. But quickly after I heard of his Death, this motion reviv'd in my mind, and put me up|on fulfilling (in &s;ome poor mea&s;ure) the will of the dead. I have here made a brief E&s;&s;ay
<PB REF="001934_0004_0FBA1E7104D69238">without looking into any Author, but only con|&s;ulting the Bible. Indeed long before his motion, I had written a <HI>Dialogue</HI> about the <HI>Lord's Sup|per,</HI> (tho' 'tis not publi&s;h'd) and another a|bout <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> tho' 'tis not yet fini&s;hed, each of them much larger than this. Let what is here offer'd, he compar'd with the Scripture, try'd by that; if in any thing it di&s;agrees thereto let it &s;o far be rejected: But if it agrees with Scripture, and is yet di&s;regarded by any, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch their neglect, they must an&s;wer to God the Judge of all. So far as this brief E&s;&s;ay, an|&s;wers the de&s;ire of the worthy Mr. <HI>Corwin;</HI> I &s;ay, &s;o far, <HI>tho' he be dead, he yet &s;peaks</HI> in it. Let tho&s;e who were once under his Faithful Mini&s;try, <HI>Remember how they have heard;</HI> and live agreeably to the truths of God which he Inculcated on them. Indeed all under the Go&s;|pel, &s;hould believe it and obey it; if what is here offered &s;hall be Instrumental of quickning any thereto, let God have all the Glory; and the un|worthy Author be remembred in their Prayers.</P>

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Since the Fall and Apo&s;|ta&s;ie of the Fir&s;t Man Adam, all Mankind na|turally are Sinners, the Children of the Devil, and liable to eternal Wrath and Mi&s;ery. Sin is</HI> a breach or <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of God's Law.</HI> 1 Joh. 3.4. Through the deceitful Temp|lations of the Devil, our <HI>Fir&s;t Parents</HI> Sinned,

Hence the <HI>Devil</HI> is called a <HI>mur|therer from the beginning.</HI> Joh. 8.44. The <HI>Fir&s;t Adam</HI> was con&s;idered as a publick Per|&s;on, a common Covenant&mdash;head to all his Po&s;terity; and therefore all his Po&s;terity were Involved in his Sin and Guilt. <HI>By one Man</HI> (that is the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI>) <HI>Sin enter|ed into the World, and Death by Sin; and &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men, for that all have Sinned&mdash;by one Man's di&s;obedience many were made Sinners,</HI> Rom. 5.12, 19. <HI>In A|dam all die,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.22. Thus all Men Sin|ned in <HI>Adam;</HI> as coming from him, they are Sinful and Guilty. And &s;o con&s;idered meerly as Sinful, they are the <HI>Children of the Devil. Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the lusts of your Father ye will do.</HI> Joh. 8. 44. <HI>In this the Children of God</HI> (by regenera|tion and adoption) <HI>are manifest, and the Children of the Devil; who&s;oever doth not Right|cou&s;ne&s;s, is not of God,</HI> &amp;c. Natural unrege|nerate Men, they do not work Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, they cannot do the things that plea&s;e God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7, 8. Therefore they are the <HI>Children of the Devil,</HI> they Imitate him, o|bey him, follow him. <HI>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.</HI> 1 Joh. 3.8. And Men con&s;idered <HI>as Sinners,</HI> are <HI>Children of Wrath by Nature.</HI> Eph. 2.3. <HI>The wages of Sin is Death,</HI> Rom. 6.23. <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them.</HI> Gal. 3.10.

<ITEM>2. <HI>God has &s;ent his only begotten Son the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, into the World to de&s;troy the works of the Devil; to Save men from Sin and Mi&s;ery, to make them holy and happy.</HI> 1 Joh. 3.8. <HI>For this cau&s;e the Son of God was mani|fe&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the works of the Devil.</HI> Mat. 1.21.&mdash;<HI>Thou &s;halt call his Name Je&s;us, for he &s;hall &s;ave his people from their Sins.</HI> Tit. 2.14. <HI>Who gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniqui|ty and purafie us to him&s;elf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</HI> 1 The&s;. 1.10.&mdash; <HI>Je&s;us which delivered us from wrath to come.</HI> Gal. 3.13. <HI>Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the Cur&s;e of the Law,&mdash;being made a Cur&s;e for us,</HI> Eph. 1.4. <HI>He hath cho&s;en us in hint, before the foundation of the World that we &s;hould be holy, and without blame before him in Love.</HI> Joh. 3.16. <HI>God &s;o loved the World, that the gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever be|heveth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h but &s;hould have everla&s;ting Life.</HI> Chri&s;t came into the World, led an Holy Life. (1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.22.) Died an accur&s;ed Death (<HI>Gal.</HI> 3.13.) that he might <HI>Save Sinners</HI> (1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.18) might de&s;troy him that had the power of Death, that is the Devil, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.14. Therefore the Scope of the Go&s;pel is, <HI>to open Men's Eyes, turn them from Darkne&s;s to light,
<PB N="4" REF="001934_0008_0FBA1E804201AFE8">from the power of Satan unto God; that they may receive forgivnes of Sins, and Inheritance among them that are Sanctified by Faith that is in Chri&s;t.</HI> Act. 26.18. Chri&s;t came into the World, to purcha&s;e Salvation for &s;in|fulmen, to turn rebel men from Sin and Satan unto God, that they might be recon|cil'd to God, love him, live to him, and be eternally happy in his Favour.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the only Saviour of Sinners.</HI> As he come to Save Sinners. (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15.) So, <HI>neither is there Salvati|on in any other, for there is none other Name giv|en under Heaven among Men, whereby we must be Saved.</HI> Acts 4.12. There's <HI>no remi&s;&s;on</HI> of Sin) <HI>without Shedding of Blood</HI> (Heb. 9.22.) <HI>not the Blood of Bulls and Goats</HI> (Heb. 10.4.) but the <HI>Blood of Je&s;us</HI> (1 Joh. 1.7.1 Pet. 1.19.) Who is that <HI>Lamb of God which takes away the Sin of the World.</HI> Joh. 1.29. Chri&s;t then is the only Saviour of Sin|ners, and he is an <HI>All&s;ufficient</HI> one too. <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.25.&mdash;<HI>He is able al&s;o to &s;ave them to the uttermo&s;t, that come unto God by him. Who&s;o|ever believeth in him, &s;hall not peri&s;h, but &s;hall have everla&s;ting Life.</HI> Joh. 3.16.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>No Men can be Saved, without true Re|pentance of Sin and Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> I mean this, of tho&s;e grown to years of Un|der&s;tanding, and not of &s;uch as die in In|fancy. Many Children of profe&s;&s;ing Pa|rents, Children of the Covenant die in In|fancy. As &s;uch Infants are capable of be|ing, &s;harers in the Sin and Guilt of the fir&s;t

He therefore that with his heart, with his very Soul, mourns for his Sins, hates, loaths, turns from them; and together herewith, tru&s;t|eth in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t for Ju&s;ti|fication before God; I &s;ay, he is <HI>Ju&s;tified freely by grace through the Redemption that is in Je&s;us.</HI> Rom. 3.21. &mdash; 25.

<ITEM>5. <HI>It's the will God, that tho&s;e who turn from Sin and Satan to Chri&s;t to live to him and be &s;a|ved by him; &s;hould be known and di&s;tingui&s;hed among Men, by &s;ome outward In&s;tituted marks, &s;igns, or badges of their belonging to Chri&s;t.</HI> Chri&s;t was promi&s;ed as the Saviour of Sin|ners, long before he came into the World. <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15.

He was in types and prefigurations, &s;lain from the foundation of the World.
