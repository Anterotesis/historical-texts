<HEAD>AN ATTESTATION, From the very Reverend Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT the Churches of NEW-ENG|LAND have been originally of the CONGREGATIONAL Per&s;wa&s;ion and Profe&s;&s;ion, is known to every one. Their <HI>Platform</HI> does expre&s;ly di&s;like and di&s;claim the Name of INDEPENDENT. The Rea&s;on why that Name has been impo&s;ed upon them, was, Becau&s;e they maintained, that a <HI>Particular,</HI> and <HI>Organi&s;ed</HI> Church, has <HI>entire Power</HI> within it &s;elf, to manage the Affairs of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of CHRIST, and the holy <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> belonging to it, without a <HI>Dependence</HI> on any &s;uperiour Power on Earth. They Revere <HI>Synods,</HI> and <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Councils,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Elders,</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI> &s;ent as Me&s;&s;engers of the Churches, when want of <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>Light,</HI> &s;hall call for their Advice; but they
<PB N="ii" REF="002775_0003_0FE63005CC97FBD8">E&s;teem not <HI>&s;tated Councils,</HI> or <HI>Synods,</HI> with a <HI>Ju|ridical Power</HI> to be of Divine In&s;titution.</P>
<P>What the Arguments were, which did &s;atisfy them, that the <HI>Congregational Way</HI> is the <HI>way of Truth;</HI> 'Tis to be &s;een in the Books Publi&s;hed by tho&s;e eminent Servants of CHRIST, who fir&s;t &s;ettled Churches, in the&s;e Parts of the World; e&s;pecially &s;uch as Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI>'s Treati&s;e of, <HI>The Keys.</HI> There is a Book under the Name of that Great Man, called, <HI>The Way of the Chur|ches,</HI> which was publi&s;hed by a <HI>Browni&s;tical Au|thor,</HI> without Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI>'s Con&s;ent or Knowledge. But in a Di&s;cour&s;e after that was publi&s;hed, he refers the Reader, who de&s;ires to know his Judg|ment about <HI>Church Di&s;cipline,</HI> unto his Book of, <HI>The Keys,</HI> and not that of, <HI>The Way.</HI></P>
<P>Another of the mo&s;t eminent Divines that ever <HI>New-England</HI> &s;aw, was Mr. <HI>Thomas Hooker,</HI> Pa&s;tor of the Church in <HI>Hartford. The Survey of Church Di&s;cipline,</HI> drawn by him, is a mo&s;t Acute, Accurate, Logical Compo&s;ure; &s;ome look upon it as Irrefragable, Unan&s;werable. It had the Approbation of all the Mini&s;ters, that were then in that and the next Colony.</P>

I might have mentioned, what my Father has written, for the Defence of the&s;e Churches, in An&s;wer to two famous Divines, Mr. <HI>Charles Herle,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel Rutherford.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that for certain <HI>Modalities,</HI> there has been a <HI>Variety</HI> of Practice, in the&s;e Churches; as there was in the Primitive; But in <HI>E&s;&s;entials,</HI> both of Doctrine, and of Di&s;cipline, they agree. The <HI>Eccentric</HI> are but few; nor are there &s;o many late <HI>Innovations,</HI> as to de&s;erve any notice to be taken of them.</P>
<P>We look upon <HI>Reforming Presbyterians,</HI> as our dear Brethren: Among whom we have in par|ticular a mo&s;t brotherly Affection, for tho&s;e in <HI>Scotland.</HI> When any come from thence, furni&s;h|ed with Te&s;timonies of their <HI>Good Conver&s;ation in CHRIST,</HI> they are as welcome to our Communi|on, as any Members of our own Churches.

<P>The Churches here, were Planted <HI>a noble Vine.</HI> Indeed it was not with re&s;pect to the <HI>Fundamentals</HI> in <HI>Doctrine,</HI> that our Fathers came into this Wil|derne&s;s. For they agree to the <HI>Doctrinal Articles</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> (as fully as any, and more fully than many,) of the <HI>Conformi&s;ts</HI> in that Church.

<P>May what is here performed, (with an <HI>Erudi|tion,</HI> as well as a <HI>Fidelity,</HI> which I hope, will Re|commend the Work,) be ble&s;&s;ed for their <HI>Direc|tion</HI> and <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> in the <HI>Good old Way,</HI> in which their Fathers have walked; The Writer of this <HI>Ratio Di&s;ciplinae</HI> will then have cau&s;e to re|joyce in this his Labour.</P>

<P>THOSE <HI>Engli&s;h Colonies</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> which are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Name of NEW-ENGLAND, were formed upon the Glorious De&s;ign, of erect|ing CHURCHES, wherein the <HI>Reformation</HI> &s;hould be carried on, unto farther Degrees of Scriptural and Primitive <HI>Purity;</HI> than would be allowed by the <HI>Times</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> not yet wholly recovered out of the <HI>Antichri&s;tian Apo&s;tacy.</HI></P>

<P>&para;.

And there is the le&s;s need of &s;uch a Repetition, becau&s;e their <HI>Principles</HI> will be all along &s;ufficiently di&s;cover|ed,

<P>But <HI>Be&s;ides,</HI> and indeed, <HI>Before,</HI> the <HI>Platform,</HI> there were &s;everal <HI>Treati&s;es</HI> long ago publi&s;hed, wherein the <HI>Principles</HI> of the&s;e CHURCHES, were, as with Loud &s;ounding Trumpets, pro|claimed unto the World.</P>
<P>One of them was, the famous COTTON's Book of, <HI>The Keys;</HI> Which the celebrated <HI>Ru|therford</HI> approv'd, as being <HI>&s;ound</HI> in every thing; except (as <HI>he</HI> thought) that of not giving <HI>Autho|rity</HI> quite enough to <HI>Synods.</HI> The Memorable <HI>Owen,</HI> attempting to write an An&s;wer to that Book, was in&s;tead of <HI>Confuting</HI> it, &s;o <HI>Conquered</HI> by it, that he came entirely into the Sentiments of it; and &s;o liv'd, and &s;o held, and &s;o wrote, all the re&s;t of his Days.</P>
<P>Another of them was, the <HI>Re&s;pon&s;io</HI> to a <HI>Sylloge Quae&s;tionum</HI> &s;ent hither from <HI>Zeland;</HI> which An&s;|wer was written in <HI>Latin</HI> by the famous NOR|TON, at the <HI>Unanimous De&s;ire and Order</HI> of the Mini&s;ters then &s;hining in the Country. What
<PB N="8" REF="002775_0013_0FE6301782B515B0">Satisfaction it gave, may be gathered, from the Atte&s;tations of Dr. <HI>Goodwyn,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nye,</HI> Mr. <HI>Symp|&s;on</HI> unto it; Yea, and from the Re&s;pectful men|tion, with which Dr. <HI>Hornbeck</HI> magnifies the <HI>Rea|&s;on</HI> and <HI>Candour</HI> of the Author, even in tho&s;e Points, wherein he di&s;&s;ents from him.

<P>The <HI>Church-State</HI> of <HI>New England,</HI> even in the&s;e Exhibitions of it, is, <HI>by rea&s;on of Strength</HI> now come to more than <HI>Four&s;core Years;</HI> But the <HI>Strength</HI> holds; it is to be hoped, that it will not be <HI>&s;oon cut off;</HI> or indeed ever <HI>fly away.</HI></P>

<P>The Jews of old held, <HI>That le&s;s than Ten</HI> Men of Lei&s;ure, <HI>could not make a Congregation.</HI> 'Tis perhaps in Oppo&s;ition to this Tradition, that our Saviour &s;aid, Matth.

Particular Churches</HI> are in their Apprehen&s;ion an <HI>In&s;titution</HI> of our Lord Redeem|er; and there are <HI>particular Duties,</HI> which the Members of the&s;e Churches owe unto their <HI>El|ders,</HI> and unto one another. The <HI>Church-Covenant</HI> is but an <HI>Acknowledgement</HI> of the Obligations to <HI>the&s;e Duties</HI> lying on the Members of the Church|es. No Body denies that GOD commands Men to <HI>acknowledge</HI> their Obligations to the <HI>Du|ties</HI> of their &s;everal Relations: But then it ap|pears very plain, that the more <HI>explicit</HI> they are in &s;uch a Tran&s;action, on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion as that of <HI>Gathering a Church,</HI> 'tis the <HI>Better</HI> on all Accounts; And the <HI>Great King who&s;e Name is Venerable,</HI> is always to be &s;erved with <HI>our Be&s;t.</HI> It is an Ancient Maxim not peculiar to the Per|&s;ons of the <HI>Congregational</HI> Way, <HI>Foederata Conjunctio con&s;tituit Eccle&s;iam.</HI> And indeed, it &s;eems beyond
<PB N="11" REF="002775_0026_0FE6302EE15C3110">all Contradiction, That where Men do not, <HI>Im|plicitly</HI> at lea&s;t, Agree, and Engage to Wor&s;hip our Saviour together, according to His Laws, they cannot be e&s;teemed, a <HI>Church.</HI> But then, if an <HI>Implicit Covenant</HI> be of &s;uch Importance to the Being of a <HI>Particular Church,</HI> 'tis argued, &s;ure|ly an <HI>Explicit Covenant</HI> is Expedient, Profitable, De&s;ireable.

In the Apology of <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr,</HI> who lived within a few Years of the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, we find the Chri&s;tians who were admitted into <HI>Church-Fellow&s;hip,</HI> agreeing in a <HI>Re&s;olution to con|form in all Things to the Word of GOD:</HI> Which &s;eems to be as truly a <HI>Church-Covenant,</HI> as any in the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>And the&s;e Churches hope that they &s;hall not hear that Reproached as a <HI>New Invention,</HI> which was practi&s;ed in the <HI>Second</HI> and <HI>Third</HI> Centuries.</P>
<P>The famous Dr. <HI>Hornbeck,</HI> a Profe&s;&s;or in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Leyden,</HI> who wrote in Defence of the <HI>Presbyterian Church-Government,</HI> has publi&s;hed his Approbation of what the <HI>New-Engli&s;h</HI> Divines <HI>Cotton,</HI> and <HI>Mather,</HI> and <HI>Norton,</HI> wrote in Defence of their <HI>Explicit Church-Government.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Zepperus</HI> writes it as the Manner and Or|der of the Churches in <HI>Holland; That when any Per&s;ons are admitted unto the Lord's Table there, they make a publick Profe&s;&s;ion of their Faith before all the Church; and likewi&s;e COVENANT, that they will continue in that Faith, and lead their Lives accord|ingly.</HI></P>
<P>Several <HI>Synods</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> have required <HI>Per&s;onal Covenanting</HI> with GOD, and the Church; and the Incomparable <HI>Voetius</HI> highly applauds their doing &s;o.</P>
<P>One of the <HI>Epi&s;copal Way</HI> complains of the <HI>Reformed Churches</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> That they would not admit a Man to the <HI>Lord's Table</HI> without a <HI>Pro|mi&s;e</HI> (or COVENANT) of continuing in the <HI>Faith.</HI> 'Tis no more indeed, than what we find provided by their <HI>National Synods;</HI> That none

<P>The very learned <HI>Parker</HI> gives this Account of the <HI>Reformed Churches,</HI> (whereto Per&s;ecuti|on had exiled him) <HI>That when any Per&s;on &s;eeks for Admi&s;&s;ion into Church Communion, his Name is publi&s;hed in the Congregation, that if any one hath ought to object again&s;t the Per&s;on propounded, he &s;hould acquaint the Elders therewith. If nothing is brought again&s;t him, he is admitted, but not without a Solemn COVENANT with GOD, and the Church: And to the Church he promi&s;es to walk as becomes that holy Fellow&s;hip: That he will &s;ubmit unto the Di&s;cipline of the Church; and that he will watch over the Bre|thren of that Communion, according to the Command of CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> appear well &s;atisfied with the Words of the famous <HI>Bax|ter. I conclude, That whatever &s;ome particular Per|&s;ons may be guilty of, there is no real Difference be|tween the Presbyterians and Independents, in the Point of Church-Covenant. &mdash; GOD forbid, That any Faithful Mini&s;ter of CHRIST, &s;hould fight again&s;t that which is profitable to the Well-being of a Church, meerly becau&s;e the Church without it may have a Be|ing. Then mu&s;t we plead for Hunger and Want, and Calamitous Di&s;ea&s;es, that leave us but the Being of Men. Nature and the Scripture Praecedents in the Old Te&s;tament, and the Doctrine of the Apo&s;tles, and the Ancient Practice of the Churches, do &s;atisfy us of the U&s;efulne&s;s of holy Covenants, prudently, &s;eriou&s;ly, and &s;ea&s;onably made.</HI></P>

<Q><P>A Body of Chri&s;tians <HI>A&s;&s;ociated</HI> for all the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel, are a CHURCH of our Glorious LORD, which have among

<P>The <HI>Churches</HI> which have recovered the Ex|erci&s;e of this RIGHT <HI>from the Oppre&s;&s;ion of Man,</HI> under which many <HI>Churches of the Reformation</HI> are to this Day groaning, ought to <HI>keep the Precepts,</HI> and the Favours of the Lord, and not ea&s;ily part with what He has given them.</P>

<P>Neverthele&s;s a CHURCH in the Exerci&s;e of its RIGHT, ought in all po&s;&s;ible Ways con&s;i&s;tent therewithal, to con&s;ult the <HI>Edificati|on</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of their Neighbours; e&s;pe|cially of tho&s;e on who&s;e <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> to carry on their Affairs, they may have much Depen|dence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> ought &s;o to manage their <HI>Choice</HI> that if the Neighbours have any ju&s;t <HI>Di&s;&s;atis|faction,</HI> all the Re&s;pect required by <HI>Scripture, Rea&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Gratitude,</HI> may be paid unto it.</P></Q>
<P>To expre&s;s the <HI>Conde&s;cention,</HI> in the clo&s;e of the&s;e Conclu&s;ions, the Churches, do &s;ometimes, by their <HI>Vote,</HI> make a <HI>Nomination of Three or Four</HI> Candidates; For every One of which the Ma|jority of the Brethren have &s;o Voted, that whom|&s;oever of the&s;e the <HI>Choice</HI> falls upon, it may &s;till be &s;aid, <HI>The Church has Cho&s;en him.</HI></P>

<P>But what mu&s;t be the Age of the <HI>Candidate?</HI></P>
<P>Without any Information from the Gentlemen who have (like <HI>Bartholomaeus Agricola</HI>) written, <HI>De Aetate ineuntium Officia;</HI> We know, not only what was the <HI>Age</HI> of Admi&s;&s;ion to the Exerci&s;e the <HI>Prie&s;thood</HI> under the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law; but al&s;o, how critical the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were about it; <HI>Alexan|der ab Alexandro</HI> &s;ets the Age, when One would think it fitter to <HI>lay down</HI> than to <HI>take up</HI> an Office; And we have <HI>Cicero</HI>'s Exclamation; <HI>Quae major Contumelia e&s;t, quam venire in Sacerdotium imberbem Adole&s;centulum?</HI> Neverthele&s;s, in the&s;e Days of the <HI>New-Te&s;tament,</HI> there is <HI>nothing certain</HI> defined about the Number of Years, which a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed before he be or|dained.

<P>&sect;. 2. The Principle which the Churches do generally go upon, has been thus declared.
<Q>The Laws by which our SAVIOUR will have His Kingdom to be governed, are admini&s;tred in the <HI>Corporations</HI> thereof. <HI>Particular Churches</HI> of Believers, a&s;&s;ociating to Wor&s;hip our SAVI|OUR in all His Ordinances, when furni&s;hed with <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> are &s;uch <HI>Corporations.</HI> But the Great KING has many <HI>Subjects</HI> in His <HI>Vi&s;ible

<P>But it has been &s;aid, &mdash; <HI>The Off&s;pring of The&s;e.</HI> &mdash; The Fir&s;t Planters of <HI>New-England,</HI> having their Eye very much upon the Welfare of their <HI>Off&s;pring,</HI> it can't be wondred at, if the Churches are for having their <HI>Off&s;pring</HI> brought with them into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of their GOD. They find the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> under the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> ex|tended unto the <HI>Off&s;pring</HI> of the Faithful: And they have not yet &s;een any Scripture in the <HI>New</HI> to cut them off, or &s;hut them out.

<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P>The BAPTISM of the Lord, is admini&s;tred in the Churches, not only unto tho&s;e who <HI>actually</HI> and <HI>publickly</HI> give their Con&s;ent unto the <HI>Cove|nant of Grace,</HI> but al&s;o to the <HI>Infants</HI> of &s;uch <HI>Vi|&s;ible Believers.</HI> They do not think, that in thus practi&s;ing of <HI>Infant Bapti&s;m,</HI> they can be charged with departing from the Practi&s;e of the <HI>Primitive Churches.

And it is well known that an <HI>Affrican</HI> Council whereat Three&s;core and Six Bi&s;hops were pre|&s;ent, A. C. 254.

<P>&sect;. 3. But <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> is here, after this Manner fought for.</P>
<P>The <HI>Adult</HI> Per&s;on, fir&s;t applying him&s;elf to the Pa&s;tor, the Pa&s;tor examines the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and the <HI>Belief</HI> of the Per&s;on, and obtains al&s;o, a Te&s;timony of his <HI>Good Conver&s;ation,</HI> and there|with perceives the Di&s;po&s;itions of <HI>a Saving Faith,</HI> at lea&s;t <HI>hopefully begun</HI> in him.</P>

<P>&sect;. 3.

<P>A Charitable Con&s;ideration of nothing but PIETY in admitting to Evangelical Priviledges, is a Glory that the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> would lay claim unto; Churches of which one of their Pa&s;tors once gave this Account unto his Corre&s;pondents in the <HI>Lower Saxony; Quod &s;e nul|lis Communionis Conditionibus, ni&s;iquae &s;int et Uni|onis cum Chri&s;to, Aeternaeque Salutis Conditiones, a&s;|tringant.

<P>&sect;. 4. Before the Per&s;ons who have thus pri|vately addre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> for Admi&s;&s;ion into the Church, are publickly admitted, he propounds their <HI>Names</HI> unto the Congregation, with an

<P>The Candidates of the Communion, at the proper time for it, &s;tanding forth, now the Pa&s;tor calls upon the <HI>Brethren</HI> of the Church, to &s;ignify their Con&s;ent unto the Admi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Per|&s;ons unto their Communion, by <HI>lifting up their Hands;</HI> [For in all the&s;e Points, their <HI>Church-Go|vernment</HI> is not unlike the Government reported by <HI>Plato</HI> to have been &s;ometimes in <HI>Athens,</HI> which <HI>Grotius</HI> al&s;o tells us was the Government of the Primitive Churches; &Agr;&Rgr;&Igr;&Sgr;&Tgr;&Ogr;&Kgr;&Rgr;&Agr;&Tgr;&Igr;&Agr; &Mgr;&Egr;&Tgr;&Agr; &Egr;&Ugr;&Dgr;&Ogr;&Kgr;&Igr;&Agr;&Sgr; &Tgr;&Ogr;&Ugr; &Pgr;&Lgr;&EEgr;&THgr;&Ogr;&Ugr;&Sgr;. <HI>An Ari&s;tocracy order|ing all things with the good liking of the People.</HI></P>

<P>A brief <HI>Prayer,</HI> wherein <HI>Thanks</HI> are given for the Go&s;pel and the Succe&s;s of it, and a <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> is implored on the Church, and on tho&s;e who now ask to be added thereto, and on others that may ask to be added, has been thought proper on the&s;e Occa&s;ions: Either at the Time of their <HI>Admi&s;&s;ion;</HI> or at the Time when their <HI>Qualifica|tions</HI> for it, are exhibited.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> having thus propounded the <HI>Cove|nant</HI> unto the Candidates, oftentimes makes a &s;hort Monitory Speech unto them; and perhaps
<PB N="93" REF="002775_0108_0FE630CD63BDC3D8">recommends to them a Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Divine Oracles,</HI> which he would have them all their Days to think upon.</P>

<P>I know not whether it will do the Part of an Effectual <HI>Apology,</HI> for the &s;trictne&s;s of the&s;e Do|ings in the Churches of <HI>New-England:</HI> But I will here ob&s;erve, That it has been a Propo&s;al made by &s;ome Conformable Divines, in the <HI>Church of England;</HI>
<Q>Would it not very much conduce unto the Glory of GOD, and the Edi|fication of the People in their mo&s;t Holy Faith, if every Per&s;on Bapti&s;ed into the Chri&s;tian Faith &s;hould be obliged, when he comes unto Years Di&s;cretion, to appear in the Public Congrega|tion, there to make a Confe&s;&s;ion of his Faith, and recognize his Primitive Engagement; and that the Mini&s;ter &s;hould recommend the Per|&s;on unto the Grace of GOD, that he may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and per&s;evere, and continue for ever?</Q> Yea, there have lately been in the City of <HI>London,</HI> many <HI>Religious Societies,</HI> living in Con|formity to the Rites of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> whereof the Relater &s;ays;

<P>The Churches, like the <HI>Primitive,</HI> have no Times univer&s;ally &s;tated for their Celebration of the <HI>Euchari&s;t.</HI> Some have it once in <HI>Four</HI> Weeks, &s;ome in <HI>Six,</HI> &s;ome in <HI>Eight,</HI> and &s;ome, the <HI>fir&s;t Lord's Day</HI> in every <HI>Kalender</HI> Month; and &s;ome the <HI>la&s;t:</HI> Some in the clo&s;e of the <HI>Afternoon:</HI> but mo&s;t in the clo&s;e of the <HI>Forenoon.</HI> And the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> likewi&s;e re&s;erve to them&s;elves a Liberty of <HI>Altering</HI> the Times as they judge fit upon Emergencies.</P>
<P>The Churches do generally &s;ee no Nece&s;&s;ity of taking the <HI>Evening</HI> for the <HI>only Time</HI> of Cele|brating the <HI>Lord's Supper.</HI> For though it be called by the Name of &Dgr;&Egr;&Igr;&Pgr;&Ngr;&Ogr;&Ngr;, 'tis well known, that in the Ancient <HI>Greek</HI> Authors, as Ancient as <HI>Homer</HI> him|&s;elf, the Word is u&s;ed for a <HI>Dinner,</HI> for a <HI>Break|fa&s;t,</HI> for any <HI>Eating,</HI> as well as for a <HI>Supper.</HI> And <HI>Coena,</HI> which is the Term that An&s;wers it in <HI>La|tin,</HI> &s;ignifies any <HI>Eating in Common.</HI> Yea, the Engli&s;h Word <HI>Supper</HI> does not nece&s;&s;arily imply <HI>Night-Eating;</HI> The <HI>la&s;t Meal</HI> in the Day is a <HI>Supper,</HI> though it be &s;everal Hours before <HI>Night;</HI> and the Word being derived from SOPPE (which is <HI>Bread</HI> that is dipped in &s;ome <HI>Liquid thing</HI>) the <HI>Diet</HI> rather than the <HI>Sea&s;on</HI> of Eating, is therein
<PB N="96" REF="002775_0111_0FE630D4CD6E9940">intimated.

<P>Thus, though <HI>Tertullian</HI> mentions the Celebra|tion of the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> as being <HI>Tempore Victus,</HI> or at <HI>Supper-time;</HI> From which time of their A&s;|&s;embling, the Heathen probably took Occa&s;ion to accu&s;e them of putting out their <HI>Lights,</HI> and then doing unknown Deeds of <HI>Darkne&s;s;</HI> yet the &s;ame <HI>Tertullian</HI> mentions the Celebration of the Sacrament al&s;o <HI>Antelucanis Caetibus,</HI> or in the <HI>Morning</HI> before break of Day; and the Pagan <HI>Pliny</HI> confirms the Report. <HI>Cyprian</HI> likewi&s;e mentions the Admini&s;tration of it, both in the <HI>Evening</HI> and the <HI>Morning.</HI> It &s;eems every Church then did, in this Matter, what be&s;t &s;uited their own particular Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>When the LORD's SUPPER is to be admi|ni&s;tred, the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> gives Notice of it a Week be|fore hand. And when the <HI>Lord's Day</HI> for it ar|rives, he u&s;ually accomodates the &s;olemn Occa&s;i|on before him, with a Sermon upon &s;ome agree|able <HI>Doctrine of the Go&s;pel.</HI> In mo&s;t Places there are held <HI>private Meetings</HI> of the Chri&s;tians, on &s;ome Day of the Week, <HI>Preparatory</HI> to the Com|munion; and it is a frequent thing for the Pa&s;tor to be pre&s;ent at &s;ome or other of them; or el&s;e perhaps to hold a <HI>Publick Lecture.</HI> But now on the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> the Ordinary Exerci&s;es being fi|ni&s;hed, the Re&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, except any devout Per&s;ons, who &s;tay &s;cattered

<P>In &s;ome Churches, there is fir&s;t, as there was in &s;ome of the Primitive, a <HI>Solita Praedicatio,</HI> or a <HI>Speech</HI> only unto the Communicants, to prepare them for the Action: But this is not in all.</P>
<P>With a &s;hort Pa&s;&s;age equivalent unto the <HI>Sur|&s;um Corda</HI> of the Ancients, [which, by the Way, confutes <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation</HI>] he be&s;peaks their At|tention. But then, either he reads the whole Paragraph, Luk. XXII. 19, 20. Or, 1 Cor. XI. 23, 24, 25, 26. Or el&s;e, Makes the Recitation by Parcels. Fir&s;t, he &s;ays, <HI>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST in the Night wherein he was betrayed, took BREAD.</HI> Upon &s;o &s;aying he touches with his <HI>Hand</HI> the <HI>Loaves</HI> of <HI>Bread</HI> in the <HI>Di&s;hes,</HI> (or takes the <HI>Di&s;hes</HI> towards him) now before him, unco|vered, where they were aforehand fitted, ea&s;ily to be <HI>broken</HI> in Pieces.</P>
<P>He adds; And HE BLESSED it;&mdash;where|upon the <HI>Communicants</HI> now &s;tanding up, he now poureth out a <HI>Prayer</HI> before the Lord, filled with
<PB N="98" REF="002775_0113_0FE5F4B6ADD12040">the Acknowledgements of the <HI>Evangelical Truths,</HI> which this In&s;titution invites us to think upon; and Supplications for the Divine <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> upon that Part of the <HI>Sacrament,</HI> now before them, and upon them&s;elves in the Receiving of it.

<Q>The Mini&s;ter gives Prai&s;e and Glory to the Lord of all, thro' the Son and the Holy Spirit; and in a large Manner renders particu|lar Thanks for the pre&s;ent Mercies; who when he has ended his Prayers and Prai&s;es, the People &s;ay, <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Prayer</HI> being fini&s;hed, the Communicants again &s;it down, and the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST having Ble&s;&s;ed the Bread, He BROKE it.</HI> Whereupon he proceeds to the <HI>Breaking of the Bread,</HI> in the View of the Com|municants, who for the mo&s;t Part are &s;ilently left unto their own <HI>Meditations,</HI> during this Acti|on; though &s;ome of the Pa&s;tors Excite and A&s;|&s;i&s;t the <HI>Meditations</HI> of the People, by now and then uttering a <HI>Sentence</HI> of the &s;acred Scriptures, or of their own Pathetic Thoughts, unto them.</P>

<P>The <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> then <HI>ri&s;ing, takes</HI> a <HI>Cup</HI> of the <HI>Wine</HI> that is now in the <HI>Flagons</HI> and the <HI>Tankards</HI> on the Holy Table; and &s;ays, <HI>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST after the &s;ame Manner TOOK THE CUP;</HI> adding &mdash; <HI>And He GAVE THANKS.</HI></P>

The Communicants thereupon again &s;tanding up; he pours out a Prayer, of the like Impor|tance, the like Tendency, with the former.

<HEAD>ARTICLE VI. The <HI>Pa&s;toral Care</HI> Exerci&s;ed in the more PRIVATE SERVICES of it.</HEAD>
<P>&sect;. 1. A Pa&s;tor being one that is to <HI>watch for the Souls</HI> of his Flock, <HI>as one that is to give an Account,</HI> there are <HI>Private</HI> as well as <HI>Pub|lick</HI> Services expected from him; whereof the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and not the <HI>lea&s;t,</HI> is that of CATECHIS|ING.</P>
<P>The Work of a <HI>Catechi&s;t</HI> was often a <HI>Di&s;tinct Office,</HI> in the <HI>Primitive Churches:</HI> But it is rec|koned incumbent for the mo&s;t Part upon every <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> in the <HI>New Engli&s;h:</HI> And there is much <HI>Variety</HI> u&s;ed in the Di&s;charge of it.</P>
<P>Formerly, There were &s;everal Divines in the&s;e Churches (it were ea&s;y to reckon more than a <HI>Decemvirate</HI> of them) who, like <HI>Cyril,</HI> and &s;ome others of the Fathers, compo&s;ed and publi&s;hed <HI>Catechi&s;ms</HI> of their own, which were de&s;igned more peculiarly for the Edification of the parti|cular People, with whom they were <HI>travail|ing.</HI></P>
<P>There is not above one or two of tho&s;e, u&s;ed at this Day. That which is mo&s;t &s;o, is the <HI>Milk
<PB N="104" REF="002775_0119_0FE630E566B98B30">for Babes,</HI> which many of our Children have their In&s;truction begun withal. But the <HI>Catechi&s;m</HI> which now generally obtains is that of the <HI>A&s;&s;em|bly of Divines,</HI> (prepared originally by a <HI>Trium|virate</HI> never to be forgotten, Dr. <HI>Arrow&s;mith,</HI> Dr. <HI>Tuckney,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Newcomen,</HI>) whereof the gene|ral Opinion, is, <HI>That no Man's Reproach can le&s;&s;en, and no Man's Applau&s;e can heighten, the Reputation that belongs unto it.</HI> Albeit there are tho&s;e al&s;o, who even in this find &s;ome <HI>Deficiencies,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Redundancies.</HI></P>
<P>By &s;ome of the <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> the Work of <HI>Catechi&s;ing,</HI> and the Task of a <HI>Pantaenus,</HI> or an <HI>Origen,</HI> has been done, with a &s;pecial Aim and Hope to at|tend the Great and Good <HI>Pre&s;ervative of the Chur|ches,</HI> which has of old been known by the Name of, CONFIRMATION; That is to &s;ay, when the <HI>Children Bapti&s;ed</HI> in the Churches come to be of Age, the Pa&s;tors do &s;end for them, and <HI>Examine</HI> them di&s;creetly and faithfully, concerning their <HI>Improvement</HI> in <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> to GOD, and <HI>Re&s;olutions</HI> for a Life of PIETY, and <HI>Inclina|tions</HI> to the Remembring and Renewing of their <HI>Bapti&s;mal Covenant.</HI> Tho&s;e in whom there are found the Agreeable Symptoms of a <HI>Regenerate Mind,</HI> are advi&s;ed immediately to apply them|&s;elves for a CONFIRMATION of their <HI>Church-Member&s;hip,</HI> in a <HI>full Communion</HI> with the Church|es. Tho&s;e who are found of a more di&s;courag|ing and unde&s;ireable Character, have &s;uitable <HI>Admonitions</HI> be&s;towed upon them; Until they have hearkened whereunto, they may not ex|pect the <HI>Priviledges</HI> of <HI>Adult Members</HI> in the
<PB N="105" REF="002775_0120_0FE630E56AA4D308">Churches of the Lord. But other <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> have yet their own <HI>Methods.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> do on the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> in the <HI>Afternoons,</HI> before the Sermon, make the Young People publickly to An&s;wer the <HI>Cate|chi&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>Others of the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> do on &s;ome <HI>Week-Days,</HI> publickly hear their Young People an&s;wer to the <HI>Catechi&s;m.</HI> And then they make a &s;hort <HI>Ser|mon,</HI> upon one of the <HI>Que&s;tions.</HI> Or, perhaps upon &s;ome Text, for the Animation of <HI>Early Piety.</HI></P>
<P>There are yet others who &s;end for the Young People to their Hou&s;es, <HI>numbring</HI> and <HI>&s;orting</HI> of them as they think fit; and then, when they have An&s;wered the <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> there are Pa&s;to|ral and Per&s;onal <HI>Admonitions</HI> given unto them, <HI>to Remember their CREATOR in the Days of their Youth.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> chu&s;e to do this Part of their Office after the <HI>Pauline</HI> way, <HI>To teach from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e.</HI> And perhaps <HI>no way more &s;ignifi|cant!</HI> The Pa&s;tor may &s;end aforehand unto &s;uch <HI>Families</HI> as he intends, an Intimation <HI>that</HI> he intends at &s;uch a Time to Vi&s;it them: And coming to the <HI>Families,</HI> he a&s;&s;ays with as decent and as pungent Addre&s;&s;es as he is able, to treat each Per&s;on particularly about their Everla&s;ting Intere&s;ts. And unto the <HI>Young People,</HI> he puts Que&s;tions of the <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> from the An&s;wers whereof he makes as lively Applications unto them as he can, for the Engaging of them in the Service of the Lord. No doubt, he &s;eldom
<PB N="106" REF="002775_0121_0FE630E66F08B1F8">leaves a <HI>Family,</HI> without many Tears falling from Souls, <HI>de&s;irous to Fear the Name of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> do &s;ometimes Imitate the Ex|ample of <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom,</HI> of whom we find,
<Q>That he would Inculcate Things on his People, with private Communications. And of <HI>Cyprian,</HI> who would Go to every one that was committed to his Care, and Exhort them, according to the Mini&s;try of the Lord, and of His Go&s;pel:</Q> And of <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Private Labours</HI> to in&s;truct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Flock are celebrated by <HI>Po&s;idonius.</HI> They are &s;en&s;ible of what is Urged by <HI>Pro&s;per,</HI>
<Q>That <HI>Bi|&s;hops</HI> are called <HI>Watchmen,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;hould Watch the Actions of all Men, and with an Aim of Religious Curio&s;ity &s;py out, how every one liveth, with his Hou&s;ehold in his Hou&s;e: What good Men they approve, they are to Confirm, by Honouring them; whom they ob&s;erve to be Vicious, they are to Amend, by Reproving them.</Q></P>
<P>&sect;. 2. The VISITATION OF THE SICK, (and &s;o, of the <HI>Afflicted</HI>) is a Work for which there are <HI>particular Officers,</HI> Men of Piety, and Gravity, and Experience, appointed in &s;ome Churches of the <HI>Reformation.</HI> And others as well as the Great <HI>Voetius,</HI> make a fair Apology for it.</P>
<P>But in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> that Work is incumbent on the <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> and account|ed no little Part of the <HI>Pa&s;toral Care.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>other Afflictions</HI> (as the Lo&s;s of <HI>De&s;ireable Relatives,</HI> or &s;ingular <HI>Temptations,</HI> and <HI>Exerci&s;es</HI>) the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> do <HI>Vi&s;it</HI> their People, and &s;uit their
<PB N="107" REF="002775_0122_0FE630E673038E18">Di&s;cour&s;es unto the Occa&s;ions; and perhaps put &s;uitable <HI>Books of Piety</HI> into their Hands. And then they u&s;ually <HI>Pray</HI> with them, that they may carry it well under their <HI>Afflictions,</HI> and that the Holy Ends thereof, may be obtained upon them. Thus particularly they <HI>make the Heart of the Widow to &s;ing</HI> with the <HI>Joys</HI> of Piety.</P>
<P>But the SICK are a &s;pecial and frequent Ob|ject of the <HI>Pa&s;toral Care.</HI> The Pa&s;tors, when the <HI>Sick Per&s;on</HI> &s;ends for them (and often with|out their &s;ending, and though they forget their Duty, to <HI>call for the Elders</HI>) have a very <HI>&s;erious,</HI> and &s;ometimes a very <HI>difficult</HI> Work to do. If the <HI>Sick</HI> be capable of <HI>Receiving In&s;truction,</HI> the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> now &s;et before him, in lively Terms, the <HI>Mi&s;erable State</HI> which by <HI>Sin,</HI> both <HI>Original</HI> and <HI>Actual</HI> he is fallen into: and &s;eeing him affected with a Sen&s;e of his <HI>Mi&s;ery,</HI> they then as livelily propo&s;e to him the <HI>Remedy</HI> in a Great SAVIOUR provided for him. In the <HI>Directories</HI> prepared many Ages ago, for the <HI>Vi&s;itation of the Sick,</HI> it was directed that the <HI>Sick</HI> Per&s;on &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>O my GOD, I now place the Death of my Lord JESUS CHRIST between Thee and my Sins:</HI> Thus our Pa&s;|tors do a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Sick</HI> Per&s;on, all they can, to place his <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> and the <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST, for Deliverance from <HI>Eternal Death,</HI> as well as <HI>Temporal.</HI> They Tender the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> to him in the &s;eve|ral Articles of it, and obtain his <HI>Explicit Con&s;ent</HI> unto them all. They repeat the <HI>Calls of the Go&s;|pel</HI> to him, and they obtain &s;uch An&s;wers there|unto, as to make it hopeful that they are become <HI>Effectual.</HI> They &s;et before him the <HI>very great
<PB N="108" REF="002775_0123_0FE630ED5DACB5D0">and precious Promi&s;es of GOD</HI> unto returning Sin|ners, and e&s;pecially &s;uch Words of a Merciful SAVIOUR as that [worth a Thou&s;and Worlds!] <HI>Himthat cometh unto me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> They go through a <HI>Proce&s;s of Repentance</HI> with him; Urging him to look upon the <HI>Sins</HI> of his <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> with a due <HI>Contrition</HI> for them; to make the Flight of a Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul unto the <HI>Open Fountain</HI> for the <HI>Forgivene&s;s</HI> of them; and there|withal to re&s;ign up his Mind unto the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> that he may be made a <HI>new Creature,</HI> and be brought into the <HI>Life of GOD.</HI> And that <HI>Repen|tance</HI> may have its <HI>perfect Work</HI> (if they appre|hend Occa&s;ion for it) they <HI>exhort</HI> him, That if he have <HI>wronged</HI> any Neighbour either in his <HI>E&s;|tate</HI> or his <HI>E&s;teem,</HI> he would now make him all po&s;&s;ible <HI>Reparation;</HI> Or, That if he has had any <HI>Companions in Impicty,</HI> he would now give his faithful <HI>Warnings</HI> and <HI>Rebukes</HI> unto them. If the Patient has been of <HI>Con&s;picuous Piety,</HI> they com|fort him with the be&s;t Views they can give him of the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> of which he is now upon the Borders, and of the <HI>Re&s;t which remains for the People of GOD.</HI> Finally, A Profound <HI>Re&s;igna|tion to the Will of GOD,</HI> is recommended as what He is <HI>well plea&s;ed withal.</HI></P>
<P>When the&s;e things are done, as far as there is Opportunity for them, the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> proceed unto their <HI>Prayers,</HI> wherein &s;uch Purpo&s;es as the&s;e are Con&s;idered and Pro&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>The Glorious GOD, who is the <HI>Father of Mercies,</HI> and our mo&s;t Merciful Father in our Lord JESUS CHRIST, is acknowledged as

<P>The <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD our <HI>Maker,</HI> is ac|knowledged as ordering the Condition of the Sick Per&s;on, and as <HI>performing the Thing that is ap|pointed for us,</HI> in all Occurrences.</P>
<P>GOD is adored as <HI>Wounding,</HI> and as <HI>Healing,</HI> as <HI>Killing,</HI> and as <HI>Quickening,</HI> and as the <HI>Sovereign</HI> GOD before whom we are as the <HI>Clay before the Potter.</HI></P>

<P>The Application of this <HI>Mercy,</HI> with the <HI>Blood</HI> in which it flows down, unto the Soul of the Sick Per&s;on, is then implored. And it is there|fore asked, that he may with a <HI>Repenting Soul,</HI> bewail all the <HI>Errors</HI> of his <HI>Life;</HI> all his Forget|fulne&s;s of GOD, and of the <HI>Errand</HI> which GOD &s;ent him into the World upon; all his Violati|ons of the Divine <HI>Laws,</HI> and of his own <HI>Vows;</HI> all his <HI>Neglect</HI> of the <HI>Great Salvation;</HI> all his <HI>Mi&s;improvements</HI> under Means of Good; all his <HI>Mi&s;behaviours</HI> in all <HI>Conditions,</HI> and all <HI>Relations,</HI> and all <HI>Employments;</HI> and above all that he may lay to <HI>Heart</HI> the <HI>Fountain of Sin</HI> in his <HI>Heart,</HI> which he brought into the World with him.</P>
<P>It is hereupon asked, That with a lively <HI>Faith,</HI> he may be helped from above to make the

<P>It is then prayed, That his <HI>Health</HI> may be re|&s;tored, and his <HI>Life</HI> prolonged; and that he may come out of his pre&s;ent Illne&s;s as <HI>Gold out of the Fire.</HI> But that if he mu&s;t now be called out of this World, he may go away with all po&s;|&s;ible <HI>Re&s;ignation</HI> to the Will of GOD, and <HI>fini&s;h well,</HI> and go chearfully through the <HI>Valley of the Shadow of Death,</HI> and be <HI>pre&s;ented Faultle&s;s before the pre&s;ence of His Glory with Exceeding Joy.</HI></P>

<P>And it has been very publickly and practical|ly an&s;wered, <HI>That they may.</HI></P>
<P>As a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> of the Go&s;pel, or one &s;olemnly &s;et apart for Evangelical Admini&s;trations, does retain his Character, when preaching in other Congregations, be&s;ides that which is his <HI>immedi|ate Charge:</HI> The Words of Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> are certain|ly to be allowed of;
<Q>Altho' we have no Con|cern in the Figment of an <HI>Indelible Character accompanying Sacred Orders,</HI> yet we do not think, that the <HI>Pa&s;toral Office</HI> is &s;uch a Thing as a Man mu&s;t leave behind him every time he goeth from Home: For my own part, if I did not think my &s;elf bound to <HI>preach as a Mini&s;ter Authorized</HI> in all Places, and on all Occa&s;ions,
<PB N="135" REF="002775_0150_0FE6311F5591FCE8">when I am called thereunto, I think, I &s;hould never Preach any more in this World: &mdash;</Q> So, 'tis no where &s;crupled, that a Pa&s;tor of a Church, may admini&s;ter the <HI>Special</HI> and <HI>Sealing</HI> Ordinances, to the Members of another Church, coming to occa&s;ional Communion with him in his own; and if they &s;hould <HI>All</HI> of them (even their <HI>whole Church</HI>) &s;o com to him, he will not refu&s;e them. Certainly then, he may as well go to that <HI>other Church,</HI> and admini&s;ter the Sacred Or|dinances to them in the <HI>Place</HI> where they a&s;&s;em|ble, if it be de&s;ired from him: It appears not, why the <HI>Pre&s;ence of his own Flock</HI> &s;hould be nece&s;|&s;ary to Legitimate &s;uch an Admini&s;tration? Why, any more than the <HI>Pre&s;ence of the whole Flock</HI> to which any particular Member belongs, to whom he occa&s;ionally admini&s;ters the <HI>Seals,</HI> when he comes to him in a <HI>Tran&s;ient</HI> Way for it? The <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> and <HI>Reque&s;t</HI> of the Per&s;ons concerned, <HI>Pro hac Vice,</HI> &s;ufficiently enables him. The Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> herein differ from the <HI>Rigid Separati&s;ts,</HI> your <HI>Canne</HI> and Company; and it is expre&s;ly provided in their <HI>Platform,</HI> That <HI>Churches may lend a Mini&s;ter to &s;upply the Place of an Ab&s;ent or a Sick Mini&s;ter of another Church for a needful Sea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the more famous Divines, at the fir&s;t Settlement of the&s;e Churches, publickly declared, them&s;elves, for the Affirmative of the Que&s;tion. And long after them, Dr. <HI>Goodwin</HI> gave it under his Hand, with an, <HI>Ita &s;entio, ita &s;en&s;i;</HI>
<Q>That every true Mini&s;ter, actually &s;uch to his own Church, is <HI>Medium Applicabile,</HI> an In&s;trument
<PB N="136" REF="002775_0151_0FE631234B9EE638">that may apply to any Mini&s;terial Act out of his own Church, in any other Church, if he be there unto called by them.</Q> Yea, when <HI>Po|lycarp,</HI> a Scholar of the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> and one Ordained (as <HI>Jerom,</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> and others te&s;tify) by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, came from <HI>Smyrna</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> for the Compo&s;ing of &s;ome Differences, <HI>Anicetus</HI> the Pa&s;tor of the Church there, to expre&s;s his Love and Honour for him, reque&s;ted him to admini&s;ter the <HI>Euchari&s;t</HI> unto the Church, where he now appeared but as a Traveller; and, <HI>he did it.</HI> Now, <HI>Irenaeus</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>Polycarp</HI> always taught the Churches to <HI>Ob|&s;erve tho&s;e things which he learned from the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, and nothing el&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, In the&s;e Churches, not only does a <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> coming occa&s;ionally to an A&s;&s;embly, admini&s;ter the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of the Lord, unto any <HI>Infant</HI> of the Flock that may be brought for it, if their own Pa&s;tor be out of the Way; But al|&s;o, upon the <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of a <HI>De&s;titute Flock</HI> for it, it is allowed that a <HI>Neighbouring Pa&s;tor</HI> may go and admini&s;ter the <HI>Supper</HI> of the Lord unto them. Only, the Practi&s;e is the le&s;s frequent, becau&s;e the Churches would not encourage a <HI>De&s;titute Flock,</HI> in any thing that may abate their Sen&s;e of the Nece&s;&s;ity lying upon them, to make as much ha&s;te as they can, out of their <HI>Inorganic,</HI> and <HI>Un|comfortable,</HI> Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>&sect;. 2. When the <HI>Communicants</HI> in the&s;e Chur|ches have Occa&s;ion for to <HI>Travel,</HI> the Pa&s;tors give them LETTERS OF RECOMMENDA|TION
<PB N="137" REF="002775_0152_0FE631234F852500">(perhaps not unlike the <HI>Pacific Letters</HI> without which the Primitive Churches would not receive <HI>travelling Strangers,</HI>) Or, Te&s;timonials of this Importance? <HI>That &mdash; the Bearer hereof having been admitted into the Fellow&s;hip of the Church</HI> [in the Place mentioned] <HI>and behaved him&s;elf inoffen&s;ively therein, is upon that Account recommended unto Communion in &s;pecial Ordinances, with any Chur|ches of our LORD, walking in the Faith and Order of the Go&s;pel, wherefoever he may have Opportunity in the Travels now before him, to de&s;ire it.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed we find, it was a Decree of a <HI>Carthagi|nian</HI> Council,
<Q>That no one &s;hould communi|cate in another Church, without a Letter from the Bi&s;hop of his own Church.</Q> The Chur|ches of <HI>New-England</HI> require it not, from &s;uch as are otherwi&s;e known &s;ufficiently, but where Per&s;ons cannot be well known without it.</P>
<P>They al&s;o admit unto <HI>Occa&s;ional Communion,</HI> tho&s;e who have any <HI>living Te&s;timonies</HI> of their having been Communicants in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or <HI>Hol|land,</HI> or any Reforming Churches in <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> or el&s;ewhere, tho' they &s;hould happen to be not furni&s;hed with <HI>written Credentials.</HI></P>
<P>But when a Brother in a Church alters and removes his Habitation, and intends an <HI>Abode</HI> with the Church, whereto he would be <HI>Recom|mended;</HI> or, for weighty Rea&s;ons finds it nece&s;|&s;ary to con&s;ult his own <HI>Edification,</HI> in changing a <HI>Society;</HI> he applies him&s;elf unto his own Pa&s;tor for LETTERS OF DISMISSION, or for &s;ome <HI>Authentic Signification</HI> of the Church, whereto he has hitherto belonged, allowing a <HI>Tran&s;lation</HI> of
<PB N="138" REF="002775_0153_0FE631252E9BA400">his more <HI>immediate Relation,</HI> unto the Church he would more con&s;tantly &s;it down withal. The <HI>Literae Dimi&s;&s;oriae</HI> mentioned by &s;ome old Coun|cils, as peculiar to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> are directed for the <HI>Brethren.</HI> Too many removing without &s;ome &s;uch <HI>In&s;trument,</HI> con&s;igning the <HI>Church Watch</HI> up|on the Remover, from one Church to another; This <HI>Omi&s;&s;ion</HI> has been an Occa&s;ion of &s;ome <HI>Di&s;|orders,</HI> and cau&s;ed &s;ome Difficulty in the Executi|on of their <HI>Di&s;cipline.</HI></P>
<P>And hence it comes to pa&s;s that &s;ometimes a Per&s;on does for many Years enjoy a <HI>con&s;tant Communion</HI> with a Church at the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord, and yet remains uncapable of <HI>Acting</HI> and <HI>Voting</HI> with the Church as a Member of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church Covenant</HI> being but the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> applied unto the &s;pecial Purpo&s;es of a <HI>Church State,</HI> and it being a <HI>Duty</HI> of that <HI>Covenant,</HI> for a Man to join him&s;elf with &s;ome <HI>Chri&s;tian Society,</HI> in ob&s;erving the Laws of our SAVIOUR, where he does in his own <HI>private Judgment of Di&s;cretion</HI> think that he can be&s;t pur&s;ue and attain the <HI>Ends</HI> of that <HI>Covenant;</HI> a Man joining to any one <HI>par|ticular Church,</HI> does in effect <HI>confe&s;s</HI> thus much, with a <HI>Choice</HI> thereupon of that <HI>Chri&s;tian Society,</HI> whereto he now becomes related, as an&s;wer|ing that Character.</P>
<P>Accordingly, when a Per&s;on judges that he can with more <HI>Edification,</HI> enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ings of the <HI>New Covenant</HI> in <HI>another Society,</HI> than that with which he has hitherto walked, except the Socie|ty have any <HI>ju&s;t Exception</HI> again&s;t his <HI>Judging</HI> &s;o, he does well to ask a <HI>Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and they of whom he does ask it, ought then to <HI>give</HI> it. If
<PB N="139" REF="002775_0154_0FE63125325A2300">they <HI>Refu&s;e</HI> it, a <HI>Council</HI> of Neighbour Churches applied unto, may <HI>order</HI> it.</P>
<P>But now, the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> having fir&s;t asked and gained the Con&s;ent of the <HI>Church</HI> unto it, he writes to the <HI>other Church,</HI> &s;omething of this Im|portance;
<Q>That [&s;uch an One] having for allowable Rea&s;ons reque&s;ted a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from this Church to that, it is hereby Te&s;tifyed on on his behalf, that he has been for &s;ome time, a Communicant with them in all &s;pecial Ordi|nances, and by a good Conver&s;ation in CHRIST, approved him&s;elf worthy of it. But now in an&s;wer to his Ju&s;t Reque&s;t, they Di&s;|mi&s;s him to the more immediate Fellow&s;hip of them with whom he is now to Re&s;ide; En|treating them to receive him into their Fel|low&s;hip, and extend that Love and Care unto him which is directed in the Rules of the Go&s;|pel. So with Wi&s;hes and Prayers for their Pro&s;|perity, the Pa&s;tor <HI>Sub&s;cribes,</HI> with the Con&s;ent of the Brethren.</Q></P>
<P>The Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> are encourag|ed in &s;uch U&s;ages, by the Di&s;cipline of the <HI>French Prote&s;tants,</HI> whereof it was an Article,
<Q>That when any one for his nece&s;&s;ary Affairs was forced to Travel, Recommendatory Letters to the next Church, were to be Asked and Granted.</Q> And the Synod of <HI>Sardis,</HI> A. C. 347. E&s;tabli&s;hed the the U&s;e of &s;uch <HI>Letters</HI> in the Churches of tho&s;e Early Days. In the <HI>Primitive Churches</HI> they were called, <HI>Literae Communicatoriae. Tertullian</HI> calls them, <HI>Literas Pacis:</HI> And the <HI>Greek</HI> Churches called them, <HI>Sy&s;tatic Epi&s;tles.</HI> That fa|mous Dutchman, <HI>Hornbeck,</HI> does commend the
<PB N="140" REF="002775_0155_0FE6312C3449DD40">Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> for the U&s;e of &s;uch <HI>Letters.</HI> And unto that Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether &s;uch Letters are not requi&s;ite in the Tran&s;lation of Members from one Church unto another?</HI> the Incomparable <HI>Voetius</HI> an&s;wers, <HI>Ita habet ordo Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus, et lau|dabili more obtinet in Eccle&s;iis Belgicis. Church Order</HI> does require them; and the <HI>Dutch Churches</HI> do ob&s;erve them.</P>
<P>Ina&s;much as many <HI>Church-Members,</HI> when they have Removed unto other Churches, without a Pro&s;pect of a <HI>Return,</HI> have been too Negligent in &s;eeking for an Explicit and Orderly <HI>Tran&s;la|tion,</HI> it is a Practice taken up, That the Churches De&s;ire and Entru&s;t their <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> to &s;end unto &s;uch Per&s;ons the <HI>Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion</HI> which they &s;hould have asked for, and oblige them therewith to join them&s;elves in the mo&s;t regular Manner to the Churches, with which they have now a fixed A|bode; and let them know, it will be an Offence, if they do, without a very valid Rea&s;on, delay to do it.</P>
<P>He that has the&s;e <HI>Letters of Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> is yet <HI>Actually a Member</HI> of the Church that gives them, until he be actually joined unto another; capa|ble of a <HI>Voting</HI> with it, and liable to the <HI>Cen&s;ures</HI> of it. But being thus furni&s;hed with <HI>Letters,</HI> like tho&s;e written of old, on the behalf of <HI>Apollos</HI> to the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Achaia, Exhorting them to receive him;</HI> or like the&s;e written for <HI>Marcus</HI> to the <HI>Co|lo&s;&s;ians;</HI> or, like tho&s;e for <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">be</HI> to the <HI>Remans;</HI> he carries them to the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> of the Church where he now re&s;ides; and the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> propounds to the Church the De&s;ire of this Per&s;on: Whereupon, if no Objection occur, he <HI>reads</HI> unto the Church
<PB N="141" REF="002775_0156_0FE6312C385A0A68">the <HI>Letters of Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and puts them upon &s;igni|fying their Willingne&s;s to receive the Per&s;on thus <HI>di&s;mi&s;&s;ed</HI> unto their Communion, by <HI>lifting up their Hands.</HI> This being done, he repeats unto the Per&s;on, the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of the <HI>Church-Covenant,</HI> and upon his Con&s;ent thereunto, he declares the <HI>Pro|mi&s;e</HI> of the Church to acknowledge him with all Chri&s;tian Regards in their <HI>Sacred Fellow&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>They that have gone yet no further than the <HI>Covenant of Bapti&s;m,</HI> for them&s;elves and theirs, up|on a Removal are to carry &s;ome <HI>Certificate</HI> from their <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> unto him under who&s;e Mini&s;try they are now to re&s;ide; which qualifies them to de|mand <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> for their Children, which may be there born unto them: and al&s;o entitles the Church there, to proceed with <HI>Rebukes</HI> upon them in Ca&s;e of their falling into any <HI>Scanda|lous Offences.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 3. <HI>In the Primitive Church there was a Godly Di&s;cipline, that &s;uch Per&s;ons as were notorious Sinners, were put to open Penance in this World, that their Souls may be &s;aved in the Day of the Lord, and that others admoni&s;hed by their Exemple, might be more a|fraid to offend.</HI> Now as the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> were at fir&s;t planted, partly on the De|&s;ign of Obtaining and Maintaining the Exerci&s;e of &s;uch a <HI>Di&s;cipline;</HI> A De&s;ign for which they ap|prehended, they had a &s;ufficient <HI>Warrant</HI> of our SAVIOUR; So this <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> has been hitherto more or le&s;s exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>If one under the <HI>Covenant</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of the Church, fall into a <HI>Scandalous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;un</HI> a|gain&s;t
<PB N="142" REF="002775_0157_0FE6312E284236A0">the Laws of our Holy Redeemer, and the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion be <HI>at once,</HI> and <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> a Matter of <HI>publick Fame,</HI> the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> upon the <HI>Cry,</HI> reckons it his Duty to <HI>Enquire</HI> into it, and bring it imme|diately under an <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cognizance.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Primitive Churches,</HI> we find not only <HI>Schi&s;m, Idolatry, Here&s;y, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Gluttony, Drunkenne&s;s, Fornication,</HI> and <HI>Adultery,</HI> expre&s;ly a|mong <HI>Cen&s;urable Evils,</HI> [Quaere, How did they convict any Man of <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> a Fault which ordinarily no Man ever thinks him&s;elf guilty of!] but al&s;o as <HI>Origen</HI> writes, <HI>All other Sins what&s;oever. Cyprian</HI> therefore tells us, That not only, <HI>Gravi&s;|&s;ima et extrema Delicta,</HI> Gro&s;&s;er Offences, but al&s;o, <HI>Minora Delicta,</HI> le&s;&s;er ones, were <HI>Cen&s;ured</HI> among them. The Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> have no expre&s;s and agreed <HI>Catalogue</HI> of the <HI>Crimes,</HI> that &s;hall expo&s;e to <HI>Cen&s;ures,</HI> except what is in the <HI>Bible</HI> it &s;elf: But the Rule which they profe&s;s, is, That an <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Animadver&s;ion</HI> belongs to &s;uch <HI>plain Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es</HI> again&s;t the Rules of a <HI>Godly,</HI> and a <HI>Sober,</HI> and a <HI>Righteous</HI> Life, as we may <HI>ju&s;t|ly Judge,</HI> that a Per&s;on under our Mea&s;ures of <HI>Illumination</HI> cannot <HI>ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in,</HI> without forfeiting an Intere&s;t in the <HI>Kingdom of GOD.</HI> Such <HI>Opinions,</HI> and &s;uch <HI>Practices,</HI> as it may be our Duty to believe Con&s;i&s;tent with true PIETY, the <HI>Cen&s;ures</HI> of the Churches do not animadvert upon. The Evangelical <HI>Church State,</HI> being in &s;ome &s;ort the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> endeavour to make theirs a <HI>Vi&s;i|ble Sermon</HI> to the World, upon the Requi&s;ites of Mens being received into <HI>Heaven</HI> at the la&s;t. As in their <HI>Admi&s;&s;ions</HI> they &s;tudy Practically to

<P>Where 'tis judged that a publick ADMONI|TION is needful, the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> warns the <HI>Offender</HI> to give his Attendance upon the Church at the Time that he prefixes unto him; and in &s;ome <HI>Congregation</HI> of the Faithful, as before, he lays be|fore the <HI>Church,</HI> a &s;hort, plain, full Narrative of the <HI>Offence,</HI> which the Brother now before him has fallen into; with the <HI>Te&s;timonies</HI> of <HI>it,</HI> and of the <HI>Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s</HI> which hath hitherto been up|on the Means to bring him unto a due Remor&s;e for it; Wherefore he al&s;o now calls upon the Per&s;on, to offer any further <HI>Tokens</HI> of <HI>Repentance,</HI> if there be with him any to be offered.</P>

<P>If he do now appear, and give &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Repentance,</HI> that the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> with the <HI>Brethren</HI> conclude his Heart come to the Frame it &s;hould be in, and the Honour of the Go&s;pel &s;ufficiently vindicated, they do then by a <HI>Vote</HI> &s;ignify their Acceptance of him; Whereupon the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> makes a <HI>Speech</HI> unto him, and unto the re&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly, proper for the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But if his <HI>Repentance,</HI> upon its being weighed in the Ballance, <HI>be found Wanting,</HI> the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> pro|pounds it unto the <HI>Brethren,</HI> that they may pro|ceed unto a more &s;olemn <HI>Admonition.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ad Ca&s;es of <HI>Cen&s;ures,</HI> it has been tho't an <HI>Indecency,</HI> to ask for the Vote of <HI>Uplifted Hands:</HI> But the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> chu&s;es to tell the <HI>Brethren,</HI> that if no Objection be made again&s;t the <HI>Proceeding,</HI> he &s;hall <HI>take their Silence for a loud Expre&s;&s;ion of their Concurrence.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon, either at this Time or at &s;ome o|ther appointed by the <HI>Pa&s;tor,</HI> the Offender &s;tands forth in the <HI>Chri&s;tian A&s;&s;embly;</HI> and the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> di&s;tinctly &s;ets before him his <HI>Faults,</HI> with the &s;e|veral <HI>Rules</HI> in the Go&s;pel, which have in his <HI>Faults</HI> been violated, concluding with Terms of this Importance.</P>
<P><Q>Wherefore in the Name of the mo&s;t Glorious GOD our SAVIOUR, (which Name you have Di&s;honoured by Sinning again&s;t him;) and with the Concurrence of this His People (a People that long to &s;ee you recovered out of the Sinful Di&s;temper now upon you;) I AD|MONISH you, to Repent of the Scandals
<PB N="147" REF="002775_0162_0FE631352C8114E8">which we have &s;een proved again&s;t you, as well as of the more &s;ecret Faults, by which you may have provoked the Holy One to leave you to what is more openly Scandalous. I ADMO|NISH you, to repair unto the Blood of the Redeemer, that you may be clean&s;ed from all your Sins, in that Fountain &s;et open for Sin and for Uncleanne&s;s. I ADMONISH you, to cry mightily unto the Spirit of the Lord, for that new and &s;oft Heart, that &s;hall incline you, not only to confe&s;s your Sin with unfeigned Sorrow, but al&s;o to for&s;ake it with Eternal De|te&s;tation. I &s;ignify unto you, that as there is Grace enough in our Great SAVIOUR for you, if you return to him, &s;o upon &s;uch a Re|turn, this Flock of his will make you &s;ome Re|pre&s;entation of His Grace, by renewing the Marks of their Favour to you. But I &s;ignify unto you, that until we &s;ee good Symptoms of a Penitent Heart upon you, We SUSPEND you from the Priviledges of our Sacred Fellow|&s;hip; and if you continue Impenitent, we mu&s;t proceed unto a further Declaration of that Cen|&s;ure, which will be a Terrible Repre&s;entation of your Bani&s;hment from the Kingdom of GOD. GOD forbid that it &s;hould come to this! That it may not come to this, we will now pour out our mo&s;t affectionate Supplica|tions for you.</Q></P>
<P>So the Pa&s;tor makes a pathetical <HI>Prayer</HI> for the recovering of the fallen Sinner, and a <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> upon the <HI>Cen&s;ure</HI> now applied unto him, and upon the <HI>Warning</HI> which the whole A&s;&s;embly has therein Received.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="002775_0163_0FE6313C747C62D8">
Perhaps he thinks it al&s;o proper to make a &s;hort Speech unto the A&s;&s;embly, directing a <HI>Right Improvement</HI> of the whole Tran&s;action.</P>
<P>If the Per&s;on by &s;ome late <HI>Removal</HI> re&s;ide at &s;o con&s;iderable a Di&s;tance from the Church, that he cannot well attend, then, upon a full Proof of the <HI>Scandal</HI> again&s;t him, the Church agrees to &s;end unto him an <HI>Admonition</HI> in a <HI>Letter,</HI> which the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> forms and &s;igns accordingly.</P>
<P>When a Per&s;on has thus received an <HI>Admoniti|on</HI> for a <HI>Scandal,</HI> the <HI>Private Chri&s;tians</HI> who dwell near him, reckon it their Duty, by <HI>Vi&s;iting</HI> of him, and by <HI>Di&s;cour&s;ing</HI> with him, to pro&s;ecute the <HI>good Effects</HI> thereof upon him.</P>
<P>Where a <HI>Scandalous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion</HI> is known only to <HI>One</HI> or <HI>Two,</HI> the Proceedings of the Per&s;ons that know it, are the &s;ame, that they are in the Ca&s;e of a <HI>Per&s;onal Injury:</HI> The Steps directed in the XVIII. Ch. of <HI>Mathew.</HI> He that knows the Offence, fir&s;t of all <HI>him&s;elf</HI> goes to the Offender, and &s;eriou&s;ly endeavours to bring him to <HI>Repen|tance.</HI> If the Offender be <HI>Ob&s;tinate,</HI> he then (hav|ing <HI>Proof</HI> to convict him) takes one or two <HI>Bre|thren</HI> with him, and renews his Endeavours that the Man may come to Repentance. If this be ineffectual, <HI>They</HI> carry the Complaint unto the <HI>Pa&s;tor,</HI> who pur&s;ues the De&s;igns of <HI>Humiliation</HI> on the Soul of the Offender. If the Man does now <HI>Relent,</HI> and the Offence be &s;till in a &s;ure Way to be <HI>kept private,</HI> the Satisfaction thus <HI>privately given,</HI> is taken up withal. But if either the Man continue <HI>Impenitent,</HI> or the Matter have &s;o taken Air, as to be a Matter of <HI>common Fame,</HI> and the
<PB N="149" REF="002775_0164_0FE6313C78284050"><HI>Talk of the People,</HI> then it falls into the Cour&s;e, that &s;uch a Matter is to be treated withal.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Repentance</HI> of a Per&s;on duely <HI>admo|ni&s;hed</HI> has been a competent Mea&s;ure of Time waited for, and no <HI>Fruits of Repentance</HI> are found upon him, the Church pa&s;&s;es on to that HIGH|EST CENSURE, which is by <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Alex|andria</HI> called, <HI>A Driving away from the Church;</HI> By <HI>Tertullian, An Abjection and a Depul&s;ion from the Church;</HI> By <HI>Cyprian, A Separation from the Church, and an Ejection out of it.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, in &s;ome <HI>Atrocious Crimes,</HI> wherein the mo&s;t <HI>&s;evere Te&s;timonies</HI> again&s;t the things, whereof the Holy Son of GOD has declared, <HI>I hate them,</HI> ap|pear nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;cue the Church from <HI>His Wrath,</HI> and from an <HI>evil Report</HI> in the World, and to break the <HI>Heart of Stone</HI> in the Criminal, the Churches do &s;ometimes proceed, <HI>ip&s;o Facto,</HI> to an <HI>Excommunication.</HI></P>
<P>But in the&s;e Churches, the Difference between the <HI>Le&s;&s;er Excommunication</HI> and the <HI>Greater Excom|munication,</HI> has appeared &s;o very little, that the <HI>Su&s;pen&s;ion</HI> laid upon an Offender, at his <HI>Admonition</HI> is often &s;topped at, without going any further. The Order, <HI>Put away the wicked Per&s;on,</HI> is therein complied withal.</P>
<P>But there are <HI>Degrees of Solemnity</HI> in <HI>putting a|way</HI> &s;uch an one; and the Sentence called, <HI>An EXCOMMUNICATION,</HI> is to be more formally pronounced upon the ju&s;t Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> never proceeds unto it, without the Concurrence of the <HI>Brethren;</HI> And we know that in <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Age, the Offenders pleaded their Cau&s;e, <HI>Apud univer&s;am Plebem;</HI> and an <HI>Excommu|nication</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="002775_0165_0FE6313D82BA0F20">was ordered, <HI>Secundum Plebis divina Suffra|gia.</HI></P>
<P>In parallelling this Way of <HI>New-England,</HI> we will for Brevity, only take Advantage of a Quo|tation from an Eminent <HI>Scotch Presbyterian,</HI> even the Pious and the Learned <HI>Rutherford,</HI> who&s;e Words are the&s;e.
<Q>Grave <HI>Beza, Calvin, Bucer, Bullinger, Melancthon, Bucan, Paraeus, Rivetus, Si|brandus, Junius, Trelcatius;</HI> The Fathers, <HI>Cyprian, Jerom, Augu&s;tin, Nazianzen, Chry&s;o&s;tom, Ambro&s;e, Theodoret, Theophylact,</HI> require all things to be done <HI>Con&s;entiente Plebe,</HI> with the <HI>Peoples Con&s;ent.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> ordering the Offender to attend at the <HI>Time appointed,</HI> he then gives him an Oppor|tunity to expre&s;s his <HI>Repentance:</HI> Which if the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> perceives not now done unto Satisfaction, he does with a proper Zeal propo&s;e unto the <HI>Brethren,</HI> Whether any one of them can <HI>Object</HI> a|gain&s;t their proceeding unto the <HI>Cen&s;ure</HI> of an <HI>Excommunication</HI> upon the <HI>Incorrigible Offender;</HI> &mdash; But if they Concur thereunto, he &s;hall take their <HI>Silence</HI> for a full Intimation of their <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> unto &s;o &s;ad an Action. Hereupon the <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> (either now goes on unto the Action, or) &s;igni|fies unto the <HI>Offender,</HI> that he mu&s;t on &s;uch a Day give his Attendence, and hear then what the <HI>Church</HI> has to &s;ay unto him. If he refu&s;e to at|tend on the Day &s;pecified, the <HI>Cen&s;ure</HI> is pro|nounced upon him, for his adding of &s;uch a <HI>Con|tumacy</HI> unto his former <HI>Iniquity.</HI> But if he do at|tend, the Pa&s;tor having recited a <HI>&s;ummary Account</HI> of the Ca&s;e, in the hearing of the Congregation, once more gives the Offender a Liberty to &s;peak
<PB N="151" REF="002775_0166_0FE6313D87A11C18">what he can, for the Prevention of that <HI>Sentence,</HI> which is el&s;e waiting for him. If what he &s;ays be not a &s;ufficient <HI>Arre&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Judgment,</HI> then, as <HI>Tertullian</HI> elegantly de&s;cribes this awful Acti|on, <HI>Judicatur magno cum pondere, ut apud certos de Dei Con&s;pectu, &s;ummumque futuri Judicii Praejudici|um e&s;t.</HI> The <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> once again, takes the Con|currence of the <HI>Brethren,</HI> as he did before; and then proceeds with all po&s;&s;ible Seriou&s;ne&s;s, Gra|vity, Maje&s;ty, Compa&s;&s;ion, and Solemnity, unto the <HI>Cen&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Primitive Times,</HI> we find that he who pa&s;|&s;ed the <HI>formal Sentence</HI> on the Criminal, fir&s;t begun with <HI>Exhortations;</HI> that is to &s;ay, He <HI>exhorted</HI> the Faithful with all Diligent Fear and Care, to avoid the Sins which had brought the Offender before them, into &s;uch a deplorable Condition. Then followed &s;harp <HI>Reprehen&s;ions</HI> to the <HI>Offender</HI> him&s;elf, rebuking him for his foul Enormities; as being provoking to GOD, provoking to good Men, and pernicious to his own Soul; And in the clo&s;e of all, the <HI>Divine Cen&s;ure</HI> was pronounced. Much <HI>&s;uch</HI> is the Method of <HI>Excommunication</HI> in the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>In the Churches formerly, There was little &s;cruple made, of u&s;ing in <HI>Excommunications,</HI> the Form of, <HI>Delivering up the Offender to Satan, for the De&s;truction of the Fle&s;h, that the Spirit may be &s;a|ved in the Day of the Lord Je&s;us:</HI> By which they meant, That the Offender, now being declared and cen&s;ured, as one vi&s;ibly belonging to the <HI>Kingdom of Satan,</HI> 'twas hoped &s;uch a Conviction of his mi&s;erable State would hence ari&s;e unto his
<PB N="152" REF="002775_0167_0FE63142C1E1C7F0">Mind, That his <HI>Corruption</HI> would be thereby mor|tifyed, and <HI>Salvation</HI> furthered.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> in &s;ome of the Churches, have now e&s;pou&s;ed another Notion of the <HI>Traditio Satanae</HI> mentioned by the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthi|aus,</HI> as being a <HI>Prerogative Apo&s;tolical</HI> and <HI>Extraor|dinary.</HI> The Sovereign GOD &s;ometimes gave to His <HI>Prophets</HI> the Power of inflicting <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> or <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> on the Bodies of ungodly Men, and of pronouncing upon them tho&s;e <HI>Bodily Mi&s;chiefs,</HI> whereof he has made <HI>Satan</HI> or the <HI>Angel of Death,</HI> to be the Executioner; Of &s;uch a Power, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elijah</HI> in the <HI>Old</HI> Te&s;tament, and <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> in the <HI>New,</HI> have given us Tremendous Ex|amples. And this Power may &s;eem to have been that <HI>Virga Apo&s;tolica</HI> whereof the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, 1 Cor. IV. 21. <HI>Shall I come unto you with a Rod?</HI> On which the Author of the Ancient Commen|tary fal&s;ely a&s;cribed unto <HI>Jerom</HI> has this true Glo&s;s, <HI>Quali Virga? Quali</HI> Petrus <HI>venit ad</HI> Ana|niam <HI>et</HI> Sapphiram, <HI>et</HI> Paulus <HI>ad</HI> Magum; &s;uch a <HI>Rod</HI> as <HI>Peter</HI> u&s;ed on <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira,</HI> and &s;uch as <HI>Paul</HI> u&s;ed on <HI>Elymas</HI> the Sorcerer. And what <HI>Paul</HI> did on <HI>Hymenaeus</HI> and <HI>Philetus</HI> may be a further In&s;tance of it. When the Apo&s;tle de|creed <HI>the De&s;truction of the Fle&s;h,</HI> unto the Offender whom he <HI>delivered unto Satan,</HI> the Oppo&s;ition of <HI>the Spirit</HI> in the next Clau&s;e makes it evident that <HI>the Body</HI> is intended; He decreed then, that the <HI>Body</HI> of Offender &s;hould be left unto <HI>Satanical</HI> Im|pre&s;&s;ions and Afflictions, by the Terrors where|of his poor <HI>Soul</HI> might be awakened unto a <HI>Saving Repentance.

<PB N="153" REF="002775_0168_0FE63142C5E32808">exemplified in the Vexations of <HI>Job;</HI> and adds, <HI>That he may Scourge him with an evil Ulcer, or &s;ome other Di&s;ea&s;e. Ambro&s;e</HI> in like &s;ort expounds it thus; <HI>Nempe &s;icut Dominus in Animam Sancti</HI> Job <HI>Pote&s;tatem non dedit, &s;ed in Carnem ejus permi&s;it Li|centiam, ita his traditur Satanae. Jerom</HI> thus ex|pounds it, <HI>Praecepit eum tradi Paenitentiae in Interi|tum et Vexationem Carnis, per Jejunia et Egrotationes, ut Spiritus Salvus fiat.</HI> Thus <HI>Pacianus</HI> al&s;o, in one of his Epi&s;tles to <HI>Sempronianus,</HI> by this <HI>De&s;truction of the Fle&s;h,</HI> under&s;tands, <HI>Carnis Angu&s;tias, et Detri|menta Membrorum.</HI> There &s;eems a plain Di&s;tincti|on to be made, [1 Cor. V. 5.13.] The <HI>Cen&s;ure</HI> upon the Ince&s;tuous <HI>Corinthian</HI> is directed by the Apo&s;tle in the&s;e Words, <HI>Put away from your &s;elves that wicked Per&s;on;</HI> The <HI>ordinary Mini&s;try</HI> of the Church was to do this, with the <HI>Con&s;ent of the Brethren.</HI> But now the Apo&s;tle without &s;taying for their <HI>Con&s;ent,</HI> by his <HI>own Authority</HI> &s;ays, <HI>I have decreed in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, to deliver &s;uch an one to Satan.</HI> In which Decree of his, he demands of them to re&s;t Satisfied, when they &s;hould be <HI>gathered together.</HI> Hence the Pri|mitive Churches did ab&s;tain from this <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Excommunication,</HI> when they darted the <HI>Thunder|bolt</HI> with never &s;o many other terrible Circum|&s;tances. Nothing perhaps would be more terri|ble, than the <HI>Excommunication,</HI> wherewith <HI>Andro|nicus,</HI> the Praefect of <HI>Ptolema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> was <HI>Anathematized</HI> by <HI>Syne&s;ius,</HI> for his Cruelties and Bla&s;phemies.

And e&s;pecially, let the Mini&s;ters of GOD, neither &s;peak to them while they Live, nor be at their Funeral when they Dye.</HI> Of any <HI>Delivering to Satan,</HI> there was &Ogr;&Ugr;&Dgr;&Egr; &Ggr;&Rgr;&Ugr;.

<P>Wherefore the <HI>Pa&s;tor,</HI> when he comes to pa&s;s the Sentence of <HI>Excommunication,</HI> does make as convincing a <HI>Speech</HI> as he can to the <HI>Offendor,</HI> &s;et|ting before him the heinous Nature of his <HI>Offence,</HI> and of his <HI>Impenitency</HI> under it. And at the &s;ame time, he calls upon all the People to take notice of the <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> which the Church mu&s;t and will manife&s;t, in their <HI>not bearing with tho&s;e that are Evil,</HI> and of the tran&s;cendent <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> in the Glo|rious <HI>Head of the Church,</HI> whereof he will have every Church to be &s;en&s;ible. He then concludes with &s;omething of this Importance.</P>
<P>&mdash;<HI>And now, In the Name of the Glorious Lord JESUS CHRIST, and with the Concurrence of his faithful People now a&s;&s;embled, I do declare you to be CUT OFF, (your Sin hath procured &s;uch an Exci&s;ion for you!) from the Priviledges and Expectations of &s;uch as are in Covenant with the Churches of GOD.

<P>If the Offender have refu&s;ed his Attendence, the <HI>Excommunication</HI> yet goes on, in Terms proper for one that is <HI>out of hearing,</HI> and <HI>will not hear.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes the Circum&s;tances of the <HI>Offender</HI> are &s;o difficult, that before the Church proceeds to this <HI>Extremity,</HI> they &s;end unto &s;ome of the Neighbouring Churches, that from their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">legates</HI> meeting in a <HI>Council</HI> for this Purpo&s;e, they may receive that <HI>Advice,</HI> which may put their Pro|ceedings beyond all <HI>Conte&s;tation.</HI> And in this the Practice of <HI>New-England,</HI> is not very far different from that of the primitive Times, when it was a Cu&s;tome, for the Deci&s;ion of more difficult Points, to de&s;ire the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> of the neighbouring Churches, to come over and a&s;&s;i&s;t with their Pre|&s;ence, to free the <HI>Cen&s;ures</HI> from the Imputation of <HI>Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Partiality.</HI> Thus when a nice Affair was to be determined at <HI>Rome,</HI> on <HI>Cornelius</HI>'s De&s;ire,

<P>If the Reader will go &s;omewhat higher into <HI>Antiquity,</HI> he may from the <HI>Archives</HI> thereof take down that famous <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> of <HI>Clemens Romanus</HI> to the <HI>Brethren</HI> of the Church in <HI>Corinth,</HI> which in <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> is de&s;ervedly called, &Mgr;&Egr;&Ggr;&Agr;&Lgr;&EEgr; &Kgr;&Agr;&Igr; &THgr;&Agr;&Ugr;&Mgr;&Agr;|&Sgr;&Igr;&Agr;, and, &Igr;&Kgr;&Agr;&Ngr;&OHgr;&Tgr;&Agr;&Tgr;&EEgr; &Ggr;&Rgr;&Agr;&PHgr;&EEgr;, A <HI>great,</HI> a <HI>wonder|ful,</HI> a <HI>powerful</HI> Writing, and one which, he &s;ays, was <HI>publickly read in &s;ome of the Churches:</HI> And which <HI>Irenaeus</HI> al&s;o mo&s;t ju&s;tly calls, <HI>Potenti&s;&s;imas Literas.</HI> In all <HI>Antiquity,</HI> after the Writings of their <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> (which indeed make an Honoura|ble Mention of this our <HI>Clemens,</HI> Phil.

<P>Under the Influence of &s;uch Thoughts, it be|gan to be <HI>propo&s;ed,</HI> That the <HI>A&s;&s;ociated Pa&s;tors</HI> of every Vicinity, with a proper Number of <HI>other Delegates</HI> (cho&s;en once a Year at lea&s;t) from their &s;everal Churches, might be formed into <HI>&s;tated Councils;</HI> to con&s;ult and advi&s;e upon &s;uch Affairs as might be proper Matter for the Con|&s;ideration of an <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council.</HI></P>

<P>It was al&s;o con&s;idered, That when <HI>Councils</HI> are called by <HI>Litigant Parties</HI> in Churches, upon E|mergencies, it had been hitherto in the <HI>Liberty</HI> of each <HI>Party,</HI> to Chu&s;e and Call their own <HI>Council,</HI> where they plea&s;ed; which left Room for much <HI>Partiality</HI> to operate, and <HI>One Council</HI> to &s;ucceed and oppo&s;e <HI>another,</HI> with an <HI>Endle&s;s Confu&s;ion,</HI> more proper for a <HI>Babel,</HI> than a <HI>City of GOD.</HI> Thro' the Gracious and Watchful Providence of GOD their SAVIOUR, the Churches had not <HI>in Fact</HI> &s;een much of this <HI>Confu&s;ion;</HI> and it may be the <HI>Prudent</HI> Servants of GOD had it more <HI>in Fear</HI> than there was a Real need of.

<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, that in &s;ome Churches, the Tran|factions may be managed <HI>le&s;s</HI> Beautifully than we have de&s;cribed; and in others when the Beauty of the Proceeding may be more equal, yet they may a <HI>little vary</HI> from our De&s;cription.

<P>&sect;. 1. BE&s;ides the more <HI>General</HI> CUSTOMS <HI>of</HI> the Churches, there are a few more <HI>Special</HI> CUSTOMS <HI>in</HI> the Churches, whereof a Brief Recitation may be expected.</P>
<P>We will begin with the DAYS ob&s;erved a|mong them.</P>
<P>He that &s;hall read the judicious Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Soerates</HI> (written above Twelve Hundred Years ago) in the <HI>Twenty Fir&s;t</HI> Chapter of his <HI>Fifth</HI> Book, about HOLY DAYS, will &s;ee very much of what is believed in the Churches of <HI>New-Eng|land;</HI> Namely (and briefly,) <HI>That the Apo&s;tles have &s;et the Churches free from the Yoke of Bondage thereunto.</HI> They are far from reviling that excel|lent Per&s;on as an <HI>Heretic</HI> (which <HI>Bellarmine</HI> did) for Complaining there, <HI>That they who contended for Holy Days, de&s;pi&s;ed the Commandments of GOD.</HI> But they are content them&s;elves to be <HI>Hereticated,</HI> by the popi&s;hly affected, for holding, as the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> did, more than Five Hundred Years a|go, <HI>That Con&s;trained and Prefixed Fa&s;ts, bound to Days, and all the Rabblement of Rites and Ceremonies, brought in by Man, ought to be aboli&s;hed.</HI> It was <HI>Luther</HI>'s De&s;ire near Two Hundred Years ago,
<PB N="187" REF="002775_0202_0FE6318F871CE858"><HI>That there were no other Fe&s;tival Days among&s;t Chri&s;tians, but only the LORD's DAY.</HI> And it was <HI>Calvin</HI>'s De&s;ire at the &s;ame Time, <HI>That ina&s;much as Chri&s;t our Judge, has relea&s;ed us from &s;tated Fe&s;ti|val Days, we may not obey any Morsal, that &s;hall go to oblige us thereunto.</HI> According to this <HI>De&s;ire</HI> is the <HI>Practice</HI> of the&s;e <HI>American</HI> Churches. And if King <HI>James</HI> once could boa&s;t of the Purity in the Church of <HI>Scotland, That not &s;o much as</HI> Ea&s;ter <HI>or</HI> Chri&s;tmas <HI>was ob&s;erved in it;</HI> Even &s;uch a Boa&s;t may be humbly made about the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI> Nor do the&s;e Churches hither|to di&s;cover any <HI>Tendencies</HI> towards a Compliance with that which was one of the earlie&s;t <HI>Apo&s;ta|cies</HI> and <HI>Super&s;titions</HI> in the Primitive Times, (and as Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> calls it, <HI>The fir&s;t Weapon wherewith the Bi&s;hop of</HI> Rome, <HI>play'd his Prizes again&s;t other Churches</HI>) that is, an <HI>impo&s;ed</HI> HOLY DAY. But they rather Cen&s;ure it as a very unadvi&s;ed Speech in Dr. <HI>Hammond; That when the Fe&s;tivals are turn|ed out of the Church, it will not be in the Power of Weekly Sermons, on the Heads of Religion, to keep up the Knowledge of CHRIST in Men's Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>The Churches make a Difference between <HI>Taking a Time</HI> to <HI>Do</HI> a <HI>Sacred Work;</HI> and the <HI>Do|ing</HI> a <HI>Work</HI> to <HI>keep</HI> a <HI>Sacred Time.</HI> To e&s;teem any <HI>Good Work</HI> the <HI>better</HI> for its being done on &s;uch or &s;uch a Return of a <HI>Time,</HI> which GOD has not in His Word &s;et apart for it, is to make the <HI>Time</HI> it&s;elf a <HI>part</HI> of the <HI>Wor&s;hip;</HI> and they judge it an unwarrantable thing, for Men &s;o to <HI>impo&s;e</HI> upon Heaven, with their own <HI>Inventions.</HI></P>

<P>It will doubtle&s;s <HI>Hearten</HI> them, when they are told, That an Illu&s;trious Mini&s;ter of State, than whom, for Uncommon Erudition, as well as the other Accompli&s;hments that may brighten a Man of Honour, our Nation has not [and perhaps ne|ver had!] a Greater; having had the State of this Country truly laid before him, he conde&s;cended &s;o far as to write in the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bliging Terms unto One of the <HI>New-Engli&s;h</HI> Divines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon it; <HI>The Ac|count of the State of your Country was very Acceptable to me; And wherein I can &s;erve either It or You, I &s;hall be always Ready.

<P>After &s;o Important a Smile upon them, they cannot but per&s;wade them&s;elves, that none but the <HI>Unrea&s;onable Men that have no Faith,</HI> will go to <HI>di&s;|turb</HI> them, in the <HI>Peaceable Enjoyment</HI> of that <HI>Evan|gelical Church-State,</HI> for the &s;ake of which they made a <HI>Peaceable Sece&s;&s;ion</HI> into what was then, a <HI>Great and a Terrible Wilderne&s;s.</HI> Yea, They <HI>Comfort</HI> them|&s;elves in &s;ome Expectation, that if their <HI>Methods</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> be not any where el&s;e pre&s;ently Con|form'd unto, yet &s;o far as <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> comes to prevail

<P>And if <HI>none el&s;e</HI> be edifyed by it, yet this <HI>Pub|lication</HI> of their <HI>Principles &amp; Practices</HI> will certainly prove <HI>their own Confirmation,</HI> in the Ways of <HI>Scrip|tural Purity,</HI> wherein they have hitherto proceed|ed &amp; pro&s;pered.
