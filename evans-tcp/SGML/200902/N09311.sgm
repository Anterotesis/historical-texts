<P>THE Subject matter of this little tract, are confe&s;&s;edly momentous and ve|ry intere&s;ting. Some things in it, we mu&s;t acknowledge, are but little e&s;teemed in this degenerate age; and &s;ome things are ex|ploded by &s;everal late writers in Divinity. But Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI> was &s;o well known, as a wi&s;e, judicious and very &s;ucce&s;sful mini|&s;ter in his life time, that his prai&s;e was in all the churches of <HI>New-England.</HI> And &s;everal of his printed pieces, particularly his <HI>&s;afety of appearing in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> and the following <HI>Tract</HI> have been found &s;o very &s;ervicable to &s;ouls, in times when God has remarkably poured out his &s;pirit, that God thereby has manife&s;tly declared his approbation of them.

<HEAD>THE <HI>Nature</HI> of Saving CONVERSION, AND THE <HI>Way</HI> wherein it is wrought.</HEAD>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Saving Conver&s;ion is wrought at once.</HEAD>
<P>_PEOPLE are &s;aid in <HI>Scripture</HI> to be converted, when they are turned from <HI>Heatheni&s;m</HI> to the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Truth; &s;o they are &s;aid to be turned when there is &s;ome notable <HI>Refor|mation</HI> made among them. But then Per&s;ons are &s;aid to be <HI>&s;avingly converted,</HI> when they are turned from the <HI>power of Satan unto God;</HI> when they have a work of <HI>Regeneration</HI> wro't in them; when they are made holy, and &s;o are ju&s;tified and made heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven; and this change is made <HI>at once</HI> in the Soul; it is wrought in the twinkling of an eye There is wont ordinarily to be a great deal of time &s;pent in way of <HI>Preparation</HI> for this change: In order to this change there

is wont to be a work of <HI>Contrition</HI> and <HI>Humi|liation;</HI> and tho' in the primitive times we read of men pa&s;&s;ing through the work in a very little time, yet ordinarily we find that much time is con&s;umed in the work of Preparation: There be many temptations to be overcome, flatteries and di&s;couragements to be removed; men lo&s;e a great deal of time by falling into &s;lumbers, by backwardne&s;s to reform &s;ome evils, by try|ing to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s by fear|ing that they are not elected, or that God has given them up to hardne&s;s of heart, by imagin|ing their hearts to be better than they be, by unwillingne&s;s to own the Ju&s;tice and Sovereign|ty of God, &s;o that commonly &s;everal months are &s;pent, and &s;ometimes &s;ome years, before they get through the work of Preparation; yet Conver&s;ion it &s;elf is wrought at once, in the hearing of one pa&s;&s;age in a Sermon, by the remembring of one Scripture. As it will be in the Re&s;urrection. 1 Cor. 15.52. <HI>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the la&s;t trump&punc; for the trumpet &s;hall &s;ound and the dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed incorruptible, and we &s;hall be changed:</HI> So it is in this fir&s;t Re&s;urrection: John 5.25. <HI>The hour is coming and now is, when the dead &s;hall near the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear &s;hall live.</HI> For the clearing of this, Con&s;ider</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT <HI>Preparatory Work</HI> is no part of Conver&s;ion. It is an Antecedent to Conver&s;ion, but no part of Conver&s;ion. Sometimes under the work of Preparation, per&s;ons are &s;o exact in their Conver&s;ation, have &s;uch affections and
<PB N="3" REF="011873_0006_0F87417C1E881210">
Comforts that not only others, but them&s;elves al&s;o think that they are converted; they have very great re&s;emblances of Grace, they have many meltings of heart, delight in Sabbaths, zeal a|gain&s;t &s;in, as do carry a great appearance of a gracious Spirit; but all that they attain unto is no part of the work of Conver&s;ion, they re|main &s;till in a natural Condition, and their religious affections are but counterfeit Graces. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;eemed to him&s;elf as if he was <HI>alive,</HI> but afterwards he found him&s;elf <HI>to be dead,</HI> Rom. 7 9. <HI>I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, Sin revived and I died.</HI> Men under the work of Preparation are under the dominion and government of Sin, their corrup|tions are &s;tunded but not mortifyed, they are re&s;trained but not killed, they are like Vermin in the Winter, &s;tupifyed but not dead; and whatever &s;hew they make, they are de&s;titute of Holine&s;s, in all their affections there is no love to God, in all their lamentations for Sin, there is no Godly Sorrow; their religion proceeds only from Natural Con&s;cience and Self-Love: The men are afraid of Hell, that makes them walk orderly, re&s;i&s;t Temptations and be &s;orrow|ful for Sin; they hope that God is not &s;o an|gry as he was, that makes them forward in duties of religion; they con&s;ider the moral evil of many &s;inful practices, and that begets &s;ome kind of loathing of them; they hope in &s;uch and &s;uch ways to will the favour of God, that makes them forward in duties of Religion and chari|ty; they hope &s;ometimes that God has pardon|ed
<PB N="4" REF="011873_0007_0F87417CDC84A4D8">
them, that makes them have &s;trong affections; but all the&s;e things are no part of Conver&s;ion: it may be &s;aid to them as Chri&s;t &s;aid to the <HI>Jews,</HI> Joh. 15.42. <HI>You have not the love of God in you.</HI> There is not one &s;park of Grace in them: Grace and Holine&s;s is quite of another kind: When they have gone through <HI>Preparation</HI> Work, Conver&s;ion remains wholly to be wrought.</P>
<P N="2">2 When the Soul has performed <HI>one holy Action</HI> it is <HI>converted.</HI> One holy action may be performed in the twinkling of an eye: An act of Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is done at once: And when the Soul has performed one holy Action it is converted: If one holy action be performed, there is a principle of Grace in the heart, there is a &s;pirit of love, and faith, and humility; and &s;uch a per&s;on is in an e&s;tate of Ju&s;tification. There is a very great difference between <HI>Morality</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> on this account. A man may carry temperately, cha&s;tly or ju&s;tly, a day or two, yet not be a temperate, cha&s;t or ju&s;t man: but if he carries holily one day, or one mi|nute, he is an holy man. If he performes one act of Faith, he is a Believer; if he per|forms one act of humility, he is a humble man. One act of Grace is an evidence that the mans heart is changed, and that he hath a principle of Grace: Men become morally temporate and cha&s;te by degrees, but they are not made Converts by degrees. The lea&s;t degree of Grace makes a man a Convert, or a Saint. Conver&s;ion may increa&s;e by de|grees,
<PB N="5" REF="011873_0008_0F87417F6373AB18">
men grow more and more holy by degrees, but Conver&s;ion is wrought at once; the fir&s;t act of Grace makes a man a Convert.</P>
<P N="3">3 Every man is <HI>under the Dominion of &s;in,</HI> or <HI>delivered from the dominion of &s;in.</HI> Tho&s;e that are not converted, are under the dominion of &s;in, enemies to God, &s;piritually dead; but they that are converted, and delivered from the dominion of &s;in, &s;ubject to God, and &s;piritual|ly alive; therefore conver&s;ion mu&s;t be in the twinkling of an eye: If there were any con&s;i|derable time wherein this work were a doing, then at that time the man would neither be un|der the dominion of &s;in, nor delivered from the dominion of &s;in; there would be a con&s;idera|ble time wherein he would be neither dead nor alive, and &s;o neither in an e&s;tate of condem|nation nor ju&s;tification: But &s;urely, the next moment after his being freed from the domi|nion of &s;in, he is &s;ubject to God. The &s;ame moment wherein he is delivered from &s;in, he is an holy man.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> That Grace given in Saving Conver&s;ion differs in Kind from all that went before.</HEAD>
<P>SOme have been of opinion that <HI>&s;aving Grace</HI> and <HI>common Grace</HI> differ only in <HI>degree,</HI> that Sorrow for Sin increa&s;es till it becomes &s;aving, and love to God increa&s;es till it becomes &s;aving: But certainly, &s;aving Grace doth differ
<PB N="6" REF="011873_0009_0F874180BB6932B0">
<HI>&s;pecifically</HI> from all that went before: <HI>Gracious Actions</HI> are of another nature than the <HI>Religious Actions</HI> of natural men. The acts of common Grace may be very &s;trong and powerful: The <HI>affections</HI> of the Children of I&s;rael were very &s;trong when they <HI>&s;ang God's prai&s;e,</HI> P&s;al. 106.12. The <HI>affections</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> to Chri&s;t were very &s;trong, when they cryed, <HI>Ho&s;anna to the Son of David:</HI> The affections of the <HI>Galatians</HI> were &s;trong, when <HI>if it had been po&s;&s;ible they would have plucked out their eyes, and have given them to Paul:</HI> And &s;ometimes the acts of &s;aving Grace are very weak; there may be Godly Sor|row in a low degree; there may be an act of Faith with a great mixture of Unbelief; there may be true love to God where there is but lit|tle love to him: Grace is low and weak at fir&s;t, yea, after thirty years growth it is exceeding defective: Indeed true love to God prizes God above all the world, but that doth not prove that it is in a great degree; there may be a &s;pi|rit to prize God before all the world, yet but a &s;mall degree of that &s;pirit&punc; Inordinate love to the world is an affecting of that as the chief Good; when it is in the lowe&s;t degree, it is &s;o; that is the nature of it. So love to God whe|ther in a greater degree or a le&s;s degree, is an affection to God as the chief good: The diffe|rence between &s;aving and common Grace don't lie in the <HI>degree,</HI> but in the <HI>nature</HI> of them. This may aapear,</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e &s;aving Grace acts from <HI>other Mo|tives</HI> and for <HI>another end</HI> than common Grace
<PB N="7" REF="011873_0010_0F87418220ECC5A0">
doth. The difference in motives and end, makes a &s;piritual difference in actions: If men do not act from gracious motives and for gracious ends, they do not the thing that God commands; there is no obedience to God in what they do; they don't attend the will of God: When men <HI>depend on Chri&s;t</HI> to &s;ave them, from the incou|ragement of their own goodne&s;s, and merely that they may be delivered from Hell, they act quite after another manner than the man doth that depends on Chri&s;t only from the encou|ragement of his Excellency, and that he may be delivered from Sin as well as from Damnation: When a man <HI>mourns for Sin</HI> becau&s;e it expo&s;es him to contempt among men, or wrath from God, or becau&s;e of the moral evil of it, he doth quite another thing from that man, who mourns for it becau&s;e it is a wrong to a God of infinite Glory: If his Sorrow were in the highe&s;t de|gree that his nature is capable of, it would not be gracious.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the difference between &s;aving Grace and common Grace lay in the degree, <HI>no man could judge that his Grace is &s;aving.</HI> Men may know that they have &s;aving Grace, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.13. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.10. But if the difference lay in the degree, how &s;hould men go about to deter|mine that their Grace was &s;aving? The man may know that he has a greater degree of con|fidence, and &s;orrow, and zeal, than formerly he had; he may have rea&s;on to think that he goeth beyond &s;ome other Profe&s;&s;ors in the&s;e things; but upon what foundation can he de|termine
<PB N="8" REF="011873_0011_0F874182DC5130F8">
that he hath them in &s;uch a degree as to &s;ecure Salvation? Where has God revealed what degree is &s;aving and what is not &s;aving? What warrant has any man to judge him&s;elf in a &s;afe condition, if there be &s;everal degrees of Grace that are not &s;aving? What rule can any Mini&s;ter lay down to guide men in this mat|ter? Men mu&s;t needs be left in a perpetual uncertainty, and remain in the dark about their eternal e&s;tate. If a man &s;aw that he belie|ved in Chri&s;t, that he repented of his Sins, that he aimed at the glory of God, it would be little comfort to him, becau&s;e he could not tell that it was in &s;uch a <HI>degree</HI> as to &s;ecure his Salvation.</P>
<P N="3">3 The Gaace that is given in Conver&s;ion is <HI>new.</HI> When a man is converted it's wholly new; when God converts a man he gives him a <HI>new heart,</HI> and puts a <HI>new &s;pirit</HI> within him. 2 Cor. 5.17. He is a <HI>new Creature;</HI> not in re&s;pect of his Soul or the Faculties of it, but in re&s;pect of the inclinations of it But if common and &s;aving Grace differ only in de|gree, then his Grace is not wholly new, for he has had religious Joys and Sorrows, and a Zeal a long while; before he had &s;aving Grace he had the &s;ame inclinations and &s;pirit, only now it is heightned and increa&s;ed; &s;ome de|grees are new, but the inclinations them&s;elves are not new; &s;o that Conver&s;ion would be not the giving a new heart, but only an augment|ing &s;uch inclinations as were there before.</P>
<P N="4">4 There is an <HI>oppo&s;ition between &s;aving Grace
<PB REF="011873_0012_0F87418589A21C38">
and common Grace:</HI> If one be oppo&s;ite to the other, then they differ &s;pecifically: Tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions that have contrariety one to the other, that are at war one with the other, and would de&s;troy one another, are not of the &s;ame kind; and truly the&s;e are &s;o: Common Gra|ces are Lu&s;ts, and do oppo&s;e &s;aving Grace: Making his own Salvation his la&s;t end, is contrary to making the glory of God his la&s;t end: Hating Sin, not becau&s;e it wrongs God, but becau&s;e it expo&s;es him, is re&s;i&s;ting the command of God: Bringing every thing in|to &s;ub&s;erviency to his own ends, is oppo&s;ite to the bringing every thing into a &s;ub&s;erviency to God's Glory: The man that has but com|mon Grace goeth quite in another path than that which God directs unto: When he go|eth about to e&s;tabli&s;h his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, he &s;ets him&s;elf again&s;t that way of &s;alvation God pre&s;cribes, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.3. There is an enmity in the ways of &s;uch men as have but common Grace, to the ways that godly men take.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Habitual and Actual Conver&s;ion are wrought together.</HEAD>
<P>THo&s;e holy <HI>Habits</HI> and Inclinations that God puts into the hearts of his People are not vi&s;ible in them&s;elves; men cannot di&s;|cern them but by their <HI>actings</HI>&punc; As men are
<PB N="10" REF="011873_0013_0F87418605FA1338">
not able to &s;ee their own Souls, &s;o they are not able to &s;ee tho&s;e habits that are in them, but only by their actings: They have a pow|er to reflect on the operations of their hearts, and &s;o come to the knowledge of tho&s;e habits that are in them; but they cannot &s;ee tho&s;e habits immediately: Hence no man is able upon his experience to tell the very minute when the habits of Grace were put into him: And generally men have thought that the ba|bits of Grace are put into men before their clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t; and they have been wont to argue in that manner, that there mu&s;t be holy principles before holy actions, there mu&s;t be life before there be life acts: But there is no nece&s;&s;ity of this; the faculty of acting, mu&s;t be before the action, the cau&s;e mu&s;t be before the effect; the man mu&s;t have a being before he can have any operation; but it doth not follow from thence, that there mu&s;t be a gracious habit before there be any gracious action: There is no nece&s;&s;ity that there be an <HI>antecedent habit,</HI> it is &s;ufficient if there be a <HI>concomitant habit</HI> and inclination. There was no nece&s;&s;ity that <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;hould have an habit of Love to <HI>Rachel</HI> before he actually loved her; that <HI>Michal</HI> &s;hould have an habit of loving <HI>David</HI> before &s;he actually loved him; there was no nece&s;&s;ity that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> &s;hould have an habitual inclination to Sin be|fore they <HI>did &s;in:</HI> So, there is no nece&s;&s;ity that men &s;hould have an inclination to be|lieve in Chri&s;t and love God, before they do
<PB N="11" REF="011873_0014_0F8741875C01E818">
actually believe in Chri&s;t and love God; it is &s;ufficient that there be a concomitant in|clination that way: And thus it is from time to time; wherever there is an act of Faith and Love, there is a di&s;po&s;ition to act &s;o for the time to come; but there is no nece&s;&s;ity in nature that the inclination &s;hould be ante|cedent.</P>
<P>And this &s;uppo&s;ition of an antecedent gra|cious inclination before actual Conver&s;ion, is attended with this in&s;uperable difficulty; that a man may have gracious habits, and yet be in a &s;tate of condemnation; that he may have a &s;anctified heart, yet be for a time un|der the Cur&s;e; that his heart may be changed, and yet abide for a time under the Cur&s;e. That he may be &s;anctified yet not ju&s;tified; for there is no Ju&s;tification till there is actual Faith. When it is &s;aid in &s;cripture that we are ju&s;tified by Faith, the meaning is not that we are ju&s;tified by an habit of Faith, but ac|tual Faith; for that Faith is &s;et forth by words &s;ignifying Action; by believing on Chri&s;t, receiving Chri&s;t, coming to Chri&s;t, opening to him: It is &s;aid of <HI>Abraham,</HI> he <HI>believed in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> Gen. 15.6. The condition of Ju&s;tifica|tion mu&s;t be wrought by us; thence it is actual Faith that is intended: A di&s;po&s;ition to yield perfect obedience was not the fulfilling the condition of the Covenant of works; if that would have done, <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> would have been ju&s;tified as &s;oon as they were made.
<PB N="12" REF="011873_0015_0F8741876350D138">
So a di&s;po&s;ition to believe is not a fulfilling the condition of the Covenant of Grace; but actual believing.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is evident that habitual and actual Conver&s;ion are together, becau&s;e both of them are effected by the &s;ame divine act, <HI>viz.</HI> The di&s;covery of the <HI>truth and glory of the Go&s;pel.</HI> I am far from thinking that God is tied up unto this way; or that he cannot give the habits of Grace without &s;uch a di&s;co|very; but it is evident from the word of God that he doth work the habit of Grace, and draws forth the act of Grace in this way: That he doth give this principle and graci|ous inclination in this way is plainly taught; 2 Cor. 3 18. <HI>We all with open face behold|ing as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are change|ed into the &s;ame image from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> Changing into the image of God is by giving the habits of Grace unto them; beholding the glory of God as in a Gla&s;s is the di&s;cerning the glory of God in the Go&s;pel. We are taught the &s;ame al&s;o in 1 Cor. 4.15. <HI>I have begotten you through the Go&s;pel.</HI> In Regeneration men do receive the habits of Grace, the heart is renewed, and the man is made a new man; and this is wrought thro' the Go&s;pel, by the Go&s;pel, as <HI>under&s;tood;</HI> for it is in this way and no other that the Go&s;pel hath any gracious Efficacy on the heart: If a man hears the Go&s;pel twenty years, and has not the &s;piritual under&s;tanding of it, it will have no gracious effect upon him;
<PB N="13" REF="011873_0016_0F87418827664208">
but he di&s;covers what a glorious way of Sal|vation God has prepared, and that works a great change in his heart: The &s;ame is taught, Jam. 1.18. <HI>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth:</HI> that is by the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> which he calls the <HI>word of truth</HI> by way of excellency, and becau&s;e the truth of it was que&s;tioned by the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Heathens.</HI></P>
<P>And by this di&s;covery God draws forth the exerci&s;e of Faith at the &s;ame time; that di&s;|covery makes men immediately to receive the Go&s;pel. When men have a &s;piritual &s;ight of Chri&s;t, they will believe on him; if they with&s;tood the calls before and objected, they will be prevailed on by that &s;ight; Joh. 1.40. <HI>This is the will of him that &s;ent me, that every one that &s;eeth the Son and believeth on him may have everla&s;ting life.</HI> And v. 45. <HI>Every man that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me.</HI></P>
<P>It is al&s;o impo&s;&s;ible in Nature but that men when they do believe in Chri&s;t &s;hould have an inclination or di&s;po&s;ition to come to him. Men may do &s;ome things out of a kind of compul&s;ion, and do them upon &s;ome acciden|tal, by con&s;ideration, and yet hate to do them at the &s;ame time: But the accepting of Chri&s;t is always an act of great freedom; when they do it, they do it out of choice, P&s;al. 110.3. <HI>Thy people &s;hall be willing in the day of thy pow|er.</HI> They do it from conviction of the pre|ciou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t and benefit of coming to him; they love to come, and have a di&s;po&s;i|tion to do &s;o for the future.</P>

<P>MEN that are converted do exerci&s;e all manner of Grace; they perform acts of Love and Fear, and Submi&s;&s;ion, and godly Sor|row, and Patience, and Humility; but the fir&s;t act of Conver&s;ion is to <HI>believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> There is no other gracious act that goeth before Faith. In <HI>this re&s;pect</HI> Conver&s;i|on is wrought after the &s;ame manner in all that are converted: After the fir&s;t act of Grace there is no certain order in the exerci&s;e of Graces, but this act of believing in Chri&s;t has the proceeding in all. Some men do not make a beginning in godline&s;s in loving God, and others in &s;orrow for Sin, and others in patience, and others in humility; but they all begin <HI>by receiving Chri&s;t as offered in the Go&s;pel:</HI> Fal&s;e Conver&s;ions begin &s;ome in one way and &s;ome in another, but &s;aving Conver|&s;ion always begins with believing in Chri&s;t. The man did a great deal in Religion before he believed in Chri&s;t, but he had no true love, nor godly Sorrow, nor Humility before: True Holine&s;s takes its ri&s;e here, this is their entrance in at the &s;trait gate: There is no &s;ure &s;ign of Election before this, therefore we are advi&s;ed to <HI>make our election</HI> &s;ure by our <HI>cal|ling,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10. This is that which brings men into an e&s;tate of Ju&s;tification: <HI>He that
<PB N="15" REF="011873_0018_0F8741899F0D47A0">
believeth on him hath everla&s;ting Life,</HI> Joh. 3.36. Whatever went before gave the Man no title to Life eternal: There is no need of Holine&s;s to go before Faith: If there were need of Holine&s;s before Faith, either it would be to encourage men to believe; but there is encouragement enough without that, the Grace of God offered in the Go&s;pel and the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, are &s;ufficient en|couragement, tho' men never did one good deed; for <HI>God ju&s;tifieth the ungodly,</HI> Rom. 4.5. That is tho&s;e who have lived an ungodly life, 'till the very minute of their clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t: Or el&s;e, if there were need of pre|ceeding Holine&s;s, it would be to incline the heart to come to Chri&s;t, but there mu&s;t be &s;ome fir&s;t act of Holine&s;s, and there is no ne|ce&s;&s;ity of any preceeding Holine&s;s to incline men to do the fir&s;t act of Holine&s;s. When God di&s;covers Chri&s;t, that inclines the heart to come unto him. Be&s;ides, We may con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That &s;inners at their fir&s;t coming to Chri&s;t, <HI>&s;ee nothing in them&s;elves to encourage them to come.</HI> When &s;inners come at fir&s;t to Chri&s;t they are <HI>weary and heavy laden,</HI> Mat. 11.28. They are <HI>athir&s;t,</HI> Rev. 22.17. They are convinced that their hearts are full of <HI>enmity to God:</HI> That they are empty of good, that they are <HI>wretched and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked,</HI> Rev. 3.17. Though formerly they thought them&s;elves alive, yet they are convinced that they are dead: They take encouragement from <HI>Chri&s;t, and the Grace

and Faithfulne&s;s of God;</HI> but they &s;ee no good in them&s;elves to be an encouragement to them: Afterwards, godly men &s;ee &s;omewhat in them&s;elves that is an encouragement to them; they can &s;ay &s;ometimes as <HI>David, I love the Lord,</HI> P&s;al. 116.1. And as <HI>Job, Thou knowe&s;t that I am not wicked,</HI> Job. 10.7. And tho' they depend on Chri&s;t and the Grace of God alone; yet it is an encouragement to them to &s;ee the Grace of the Spirit in them|&s;elves. But &s;inners at their fir&s;t coming to Chri&s;t, &s;ee nothing in them&s;elves to be an en|couragement to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. That men are <HI>&s;anctified by faith.</HI> Act. 26.18. <HI>Sanctified by faith in me.</HI> Act. 15.9. <HI>Purifying their hearts by faith.</HI> Their Love and Repentance are the fruit of Faith; and therefore no other holy carriages are antece|dent to Faith. All that are unbelievers are de&s;titute of other Graces: If there be appear|ances of Repentance and love to God's glory, they are but delu&s;ions: If other gracious car|riages depend on Faith, they do not preceed Faith; for the effect is not before the cau&s;e. If Faith have no being it can have no opera|tion: If there were any Holine&s;s that went before Faith, that Sanctification is not thro' Faith in Chri&s;t, then their hearts were purified without Faith.</P>
<P N="3">3 The <HI>Go&s;pel is the means of Conver&s;ion.</HI> It is by the Go&s;pel that the hearts of men are made holy: 1 Cor. 4.15. <HI>I have begotten you thro' the Go&s;pel.</HI> The works of Creation and
<PB N="17" REF="011873_0020_0F87418D32D33718" MS="y">
common Providence teach men to be holy, but do not make men holy: So the Law or <HI>Cove|nant of Works</HI> teacheth men that they &s;hould be holy, but that does not make men holy; but it is the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> that makes men holy: When <HI>Paul</HI> was &s;ent to preach the Go&s;pel, the de&s;ign was to turn men from the power of Satan unto God; and if the Go&s;pel be the in&s;trument of Conver&s;ion, men have no Ho|line&s;s 'till they do receive the Go&s;pel. So long as the offers of the Go&s;pel are rejected or neglected, it can have no &s;anctifying efficacy on them: it may work &s;ome common affect|ions, but it does not change their hearts. If men are not wrought upon by the Go&s;pel to give entertainment to Chri&s;t, it hath no other gracious effect on them. The fir&s;t gracious effect of the Go&s;pel is to make men come to Chri&s;t, other gracious effects are con&s;equen|tial to this.</P>

<P N="1">1. There is a <HI>believing of the Word of God.</HI> God &s;peaks a great deal in the Go&s;pel to en|courage Sinners to come to Chri&s;t. He tells us, that he calls us, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God, that he is appointed to be a Prince and a Saviour, that he died for our Sins, that he has &s;atisfyed the Ju&s;tice of God, that he is ri&s;en from the dead, and &s;its at the right hand of God, that he will of his free Grace pardon all the Sins of tho&s;e that come to him; and the man when he comes to Chri&s;t receives the whole <HI>Doctrine of the Go&s;|pel</HI> as the <HI>true &s;ayings of God:</HI> He rejects all carnal rea&s;ons, and <HI>&s;ets his &s;eal that God is true.</HI> He made a Profe&s;&s;ion before, but now he does not <HI>&s;tagger at the promi&s;e of God through unbelief;</HI> he is &s;atisfyed that <HI>the Go&s;pel is no cunningly devi&s;ed fable&punc;</HI> but the very Word of God; 1 The&s;. 2, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">3, <HI>Ye received the word not as the word of man, but as it is in truth the word of God, which effectually worketh in you that be|lieve:</HI> They do not look upon it as probable as they did before, but have the a&s;&s;urance of the truth of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is <HI>Love to God and Chri&s;t.</HI> When the Soul marries to Chri&s;t, he doth it with a &s;pirit of Love: He takes God as his Portion, he takes his &s;atisfaction in God; he comes to

God not for &s;ome Conveniency but for Ble&s;&s;|edne&s;s, he takes him as one that is &s;ufficient to make him happy; he de&s;pi&s;es all the world in compari&s;on of God: He takes a compla|cency in God, and &s;ees the gloriou&s;ne&s;s and amiablene&s;s of God: The love of God ap|pearing in the Go&s;pel draws his heart. He loves to <HI>depend on Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and to put <HI>hon|our upon him.</HI> This way of Salvation plea&s;es him, he looks upon Chri&s;t excellent and glo|rious, he extols Chri&s;t: Cant. 5.11. <HI>My be|loved is white and ruddy, the chiefe&s;t of ten thou&s;ands.</HI> and v. 16. <HI>He is altogether lovely.</HI> His coming to Chri&s;t is not a forced thing; but he e&s;teems him <HI>fairer than the children of men,</HI> P&s;al. 45.2.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> The Infu&s;ion of Grace doth mortify Corruption.</HEAD>
<P>BY putting Grace into the heart God doth de&s;troy the <HI>power of Sin.</HI> Natural men are not able to mortify their own corruptions: Whatever improvement they make of their natural abilities and outward opportunities, they will fall &s;hort of mortifying their corrup|tions: They may do &s;everal things in order to the mortifying their Sins, but they cannot effect it: They may re&s;train them&s;elves much from the acts of Sin, but the lopping of the tree does not kill the root&punc; If they do not make provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, yet they cannot &s;tarve it: If they bewail their Sins, and cry out again&s;t them, and call them&s;elves madmen, that will not do. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> bewailed his Sin, <HI>Exod</HI> 9.27.

Sins, that will not &s;erve the turn. Such men may con&s;ider, that if their Sins don't die, their Souls mu&s;t die&punc; according to that, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.13. <HI>If ye live after the fle&s;h ye &s;hall die, but if ye thro' the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the fle&s;h, ye &s;hall live.</HI> They may think that Sin is di&s;honourable and unprofitable; that there is ingratitude, inju&s;tice and impudence in it: If we con&s;ider &s;uch things a thou&s;and times o|ver, that will not mortify their corruptions; but it is God that doth it, and the way where|in he doth it, is by <HI>infu&s;ing a principle of Grace</HI> into the heart. The infu&s;ion of Grace and the mortification of corruption&punc; are at the &s;ame in&s;tant. Mortification of corruption dont fol|low after the infu&s;ion of Grace, but is contem|porary with it. 2. Cor. 5 17. <HI>Old things are pa&s;&s;ed away, and all things are made new.</HI> The&s;e two works are done by the &s;ame operation. God does not put forth two operations, one to make men gracious, the other to kill their corruptions; but the &s;ame divine act has the&s;e two effects, to give new inclinations, and de|&s;troy the old. God re&s;trains the corruptions of men before he puts Grace into them; and takes away much of tho&s;e evil habits that men had contracted by a cour&s;e of Sin: He doth that by terrifying the Con&s;cience, giving &s;ome common encouragements, and by human re|&s;traints, and education; but it is by giving Grace to the Soul that corruption is morttify|ed. Corruption is not mortifyed before the in|fu&s;ion of Grace, neither is the infu&s;ion of Grace before mortification; but they are wrought at once by the &s;ame act.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="011873_0028_0F8741962920BF60"><HI>Arg.</HI> 1. The &s;ame light that works gracious inclinations, doth de&s;troy Sin. The way wherein God communicates Grace is by teach|ing men how glorious he is. He lets in <HI>Go&s;|pel light,</HI> and &s;o works gracious inclinations. Men &s;ee the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> why they &s;hould love God, tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, and be humble, and this in|clines the heart that way. God deals with men as with rational creatures; he di&s;covers to them the <HI>Rea&s;on and Foundation</HI> of holy car|riages, and &s;o di&s;po&s;es the heart to them, 2 Cor. 4.18. <HI>We all beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image.</HI> He makes them know him&s;elf, and &s;o makes them &s;incere. P&s;al. 36.10. <HI>Stretch forth thy loving kindne&s;s to them that know thee, and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s to the upright in heart.</HI> He teaches them, and &s;o they come to Chri&s;t, Joh. 6.45. <HI>Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me.</HI> And it is the &s;ame way that he mortifies their corruption. This light weans them from the world, kills the pride of their hearts. This light makes them hate the ways of Sin. At the &s;ame time that they &s;ee rea&s;on to exalt God, they &s;ee the evil of pride. When they &s;ee rea&s;on to love God, they &s;ee that there is no rea&s;on to dote on the world, Act. 26.18. <HI>To turn them from dark|ne&s;s to light and from the power of Satan to-God.</HI></P>

Holine&s;s. When man lo&s;t the image of God, there was nothing po&s;itive put into him. The condition of man by nature is, that he is de&s;titute of Love, and Faith, and Humili|ty; and thence he runs into evil, and is di&s;|po&s;ed to love the world, and &s;et up him&s;elf a|bove God. This &s;hews that the very giving of Grace mortifies corruption. When the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is given, the privation is expell'd. When light comes into the eye, the darkne&s;s is gone: When &s;ight is given to men, blindne&s;s is ta|ken away: When life came into <HI>Lazarus,</HI> he was delivered from death: When love to God is put into the Soul, inordinate &s;elf-love is mortifyed. When Faith is wrought in the heart, Unbelief is mortifyed. When men are made humble, their Price is mortifyed. When God conveys &s;piritual Life to men, without any more to do, they are delivered from &s;pi|ritual Death: Rom 8.2 <HI>The law of the &s;pi|rit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, has made me free from the law of &s;in and of death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 3 Holine&s;s doth imply in it a hatred to Sin. Where Sin is hated it is mortifyed; that was <HI>Paul</HI>'s &s;pirit, Rom 7.15. <HI>What I hate, that I do.</HI> When Sin is hated, then the &s;trength of it is abated. The &s;trength of Sin lies in men's love to Sin. Wherever Sin is hated as the greate&s;t evil it is mortifyed: As it lo&s;eth the love of men, &s;o it lo&s;eth it's &s;trength. That was a &s;ign of <HI>David</HI>'s morti|fication, that he hated vain thoughts, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.113. And wherever there is Holine&s;s
<PB N="27" REF="011873_0030_0F8741972ABFE4B8">
there is an hatred of Sin. If the heart of a man be inclined to believe, he hates unbelief; unbelief is contrary to that inclination: So, if a man have an inclination to love God as his chief Good, he will hate the workings of pride and worldline&s;s, the &s;etting up any other thing above God. Sinful inclinations are enemies to Holine&s;s, and holy inclinations are enemies to Sin. They have a tendency in them&s;elves to de&s;troy one another: Gal. 5.17. <HI>The fle&s;h lu&s;teth again&s;t the &s;pirit, and the &s;pirit again&s;t the fle&s;h, and the&s;e are contrary the one to the other.</HI> There is a warfare between Grace and Corruption, they &s;eek the de&s;tructi|on of one another.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 4. The more degrees of Grace men get, the more Sin is mortifyed. The more men put on the new man, the more they put off the old man. Holine&s;s and Mortification hold an exact proportion one to the other. As one Scale ri&s;es, the other falls: As water comes into the ve&s;&s;el, the air is expelled: The more light is in the air, the le&s;s darkne&s;s: 2 Sam. 3 1. <HI>David waxed &s;tronger and &s;tronger, and the hou&s;e of Soul waxed weaker and weaker,</HI> As Grace flouri&s;hes, &s;o Sin dies. Whenever there is any addition to Grace, there is a pro|portionable &s;ub&s;traction from Corruption. The more humility, the le&s;s pride. They that are very humble, are not very proud.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Conver&s;ion is wrought by Light.</HEAD>
<P>GOD is the Author of Conver&s;ion: Men mu&s;t be born of the &s;pirit. Whatever means are u&s;ed they will be ineffectual, if there be not the operation of the &s;pirit: Jam. 1.18. <HI>Of his own will begat he us.</HI> Such as are con|verted are <HI>born of God,</HI> Joh. 1.13. And the way wherein he doth it, is by <HI>letting &s;piritual light into the Soul;</HI> by irradiating the mind, letting in beams of light into the heart. In that way God increa&s;eth Grace, and in that way he giveth Grace at fir&s;t. While men re|main in darkne&s;s, they do remain in the king|dom of darkne&s;s; but by inlightning the mind he changes the heart. It is by inward di&s;co|veries of the Glory of God that he &s;anctifies the heart&punc; In this way the Go&s;pel doth be|come a rod of &s;trength. P&s;al. 110.2. <HI>The Lord &s;hall &s;end forth the rod of thy &s;trength out of Zion.</HI> Spiritual &s;ight prevails immediately upon the heart. Men that have refu&s;ed a long while do refu&s;e no longer after God lets in this light: Act. 26.18. <HI>To open their eyes, to turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Sa|tan

unto God.</HI> 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>We all as with open face beholding in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> All that are ignorant of God remain unconverted; all that know God are converted.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 1. Man's being capable to know God makes him capable to be holy. If man had not a rea&s;onable Soul capable to know God, he could not be capable to be holy. The in|ferior creatures though they have &s;ome know|ledge and re&s;emblances of rea&s;on, yet are un|capable of the knowledge of God, and accor|dingly are uncapable of holine&s;s, and accord|ingly are not under the direction of the <HI>Moral Law.</HI> But if God makes man capable to know him, he thereby makes him capable of holine&s;s; the rea&s;on of it is, becau&s;e if he actually <HI>knows God,</HI> he <HI>will be holy:</HI> The know|ledge of God and holine&s;s go together: P&s;al. 36.10. <HI>Stretch forth thy loving kindne&s;s to them that know thee, and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s to the upright in heart.</HI> God is &s;o glorious, that if he be known, the heart will be drawn to him. P&s;al. 36.7. <HI>Becau&s;e of the excellency of thy loving kind|ne&s;s, the children of men put their tru&s;t in the &s;hadow of thy wings.</HI> The excellency of God draws the heart irre&s;i&s;tably to him, when it is know. The knowledge of God is in&s;eparable from holine&s;s. All that know him are holy: The very capacity to know God, makes men capable to be holy, to love him and tru&s;t in him. The Angelical nature is capable to know
<PB N="30" REF="011873_0033_0F8741995E636758">
God, and &s;o capable of holine&s;s, and &s;o the human Nature: And when men are renewed in the image of God, they are renewed in knowledge; Col. 3.10. <HI>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after tho image of him that created him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ar.</HI> 2. Until men <HI>know God,</HI> no <HI>terror, or puni&s;hment, or per&s;wa&s;ion, will make them holy.</HI> Many men have very &s;trong per&s;wa&s;ions &s;et before them to induce than to be holy; the equity of it, the profit, the plea&s;ure, and the honour of it, are amply demon&s;trated; &s;uch arguments are as wont mightily to prevail in other ca&s;es; yet the men are not gained, they make their hearts as adaments, and they will not be gained until they have the knowledge of God. If the per&s;wa&s;ions do beget &s;ome de&s;ires, if they do beget &s;ome re&s;olutions, if they prevail on men to make &s;ome attempts; yet they do not make men holy: Men mu&s;t be taught of God el&s;e they will not be holy. Jon. 6 45. <HI>Every man that hath heard and learn|ed of the Father, cometh unto me.</HI> Terrors of con&s;cience will not make men holy. Men cannot be frighted into the love of God. Men may be &s;cared it to <HI>Reformation,</HI> but not into <HI>Conver&s;ion.</HI> Trembling may take hold on hypocrites, yet they remain hypocrites. <HI>Cain</HI>'s terrors did not made him holy. <HI>Judas</HI> his terrors did not make him holy. Fear will make men hypocrites, but not Saints, P&s;al. 78.34, <HI>When he &s;lew them, then they &s;ought him,</HI> but, v. 36. <HI>They flattered him with their mouth, and
<PB N="31" REF="011873_0034_0F87419A2CD35F50">
lied unto him with their tongue.</HI> The <HI>fear of Hell</HI> will not make men hate &s;in more than hell: Puni&s;hments will not make men holy. Hell-fire will not purge away men's dro&s;s. One glimp&s;e of the glory of God, will do more than all the puni&s;hments in the world to make men holy. Cant. 1.4. <HI>Draw me and I will run after thee</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 3. The <HI>perfect knowledge of God is ac|companied with perfect Holine&s;s.</HI> Holine&s;s al|ways hold a proportion to men's knowledge of the glory of God. They that have not the knowledge of the glory of God, have not one &s;park of holine&s;s; if they pretend to it, yet they are utterly de&s;titute of it. Men may &s;et up <HI>Altars</HI> to the <HI>unknown God,</HI> but they never love an unknown God. And when there is the beginning of the knowledge of God, there is the beginning of holine&s;s; and as the know|ledge God increa&s;es, &s;o holine&s;s increa&s;es; they keep pace one with the other, they are in exact proportion one to the other. Every beam of light has heat in it, 2 Pet. 1.2 <HI>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the know|ledge of God, and of our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And when the knowledge of God is perfect, holine&s;s will be perfect. We can never com|prehend God, nor &s;earch out the almighty to perfection; yet the grace of Knowledge may be perfect: And when men do enjoy the light of Glory, they will be as holy as they de&s;ire to be. Light and life will be perfected toge|ther. <HI>Heaven</HI> is a place of <HI>perfect Light,</HI> and
<PB N="32" REF="011873_0035_0F87419D363624B0">
<HI>perfect Holine&s;s:</HI> P&s;al. 17.5. <HI>I &s;hall behold his face in righteou&s;ne&s;s, I &s;hall be &s;atisfied with thy likene&s;s.</HI> 1 Joh 3.2. <HI>We &s;hall be like him, for we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arg</HI> 4. When <HI>men do &s;ee the glory of God, they would act again&s;t their nature if they &s;hould not be holy.</HI> Every creature will act it's nature, and &s;o will Man. When men know things to be true, they will a&s;&s;ent to them. When men &s;ee God, they know his te&s;timony to be true: When men know the excellency of God, they mu&s;t chu&s;e him. The glory of God is &s;uch, that it captivates the heart; where it is &s;een it has a magnetic power; it irre&s;i&s;tably conquers the will. There is a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of loving God, when he is &s;een; if men &s;hould not, they would act again&s;t their nature. There is no power in the will to re|&s;i&s;t holine&s;s when the glory of God is &s;een. It is impo&s;&s;ible in nature that men &s;hould know God and not be holy. The will always fol|lows the la&s;t dictates of the Under&s;tanding. The Under&s;tanding is the guide of the will; the will always follows its direction. Men would offer violence to their nature, if they &s;hould do otherwi&s;e. The <HI>excellency of God</HI> is a <HI>&s;ufficient rea&s;on for men's loving and &s;erving him:</HI> Becau&s;e God has &s;uch excellency, it is man's duty to love and &s;erve him; and it is their happine&s;s to love and &s;erve him: And when they know the excellency of God it will be their practice. The gloriou&s;ne&s;s of God has a commanding power on the heart.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Men are capable to receive Light from the Spirit of God, before they have an habitual Change in their Under&s;tanding.</HEAD>
<P>MAN in his natural e&s;tate is repre&s;ented in Scripture at utterly depraved, <HI>dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins.</HI> He is blind, and in dark|ne&s;s. And it may be thought that he is in|capble to &s;ee the gloriou&s;ne&s;s of God, until there be fir&s;t an habitual change in his unde|&s;tanding; but if we examine the word of God, we may find plain intimations, that this light doth precede the habitual change. Joh. 5.25. <HI>The time is coming, and now is, when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that bear &s;hall live.</HI> Hearing the voice of Chri&s;t is antecedent to their living: It is in that way that life enters into them, 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>We all with open face beholding as is a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image:</HI> Before they are changed into God's image, they do behold his Glory. This makes it evident, that men are capable to behold the glory of the Lord before the habitual change. God di&s;covers his Glory, and that inclines him to a&s;&s;ent and draws forth an actual a&s;&s;ent. Which may be further con&s;idered by the&s;e con&s;iderations.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 1. Man <HI>in his corrupted e&s;tate has his natural faculty of under&s;tanding.</HI> He hath the faculty of under&s;tanding in his corrupted e&s;tate, and in his renewed e&s;tate. A godly man has not two faculties of under&s;tanding
<PB N="34" REF="011873_0037_0F87419EA06365A8">
one whereby he knows God, and another whereby he knows other things; but by the faculty of under&s;tanding he knows God and Chri&s;t, and the truth of promi&s;es, and likewi&s;e rules of art, the motions of the Sun and Moon, and the natural cau&s;es. Where there is a natural under&s;tanding, endued with literal knowledge, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Spirit of God, there is a power to know God: In that ca&s;e there is nothing wanting in order to the &s;piri|tual knowledge of God. Men need no other faculty in order to &s;piritual knowledge provid|ed it be <HI>duly enlightned.</HI> To imagine that there needs any other Power, is to fancy the need of another faculty, or a faculty in a fa|culty, in order to the knowledge of God; as if we under&s;tood the creature by one faculty, and God by another. A faculty of under|&s;tanding in&s;tructed and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Spirit, mu&s;t needs enable men to know God.</P>
<P><HI>Arg</HI> 2. An <HI>babitual change in the under&s;tand|ing, does not give men a power to know God.</HI> It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that there is &s;uch a thing as an habitual change in the under&s;tand|ing: Godly men have a &s;anctified mind; they have a principle put into them, that leads them to judge aright concerning God and Chri&s;t; and a principle of Faith to re|ceive the te&s;timony of God: But habits does not give men a power to know. We mu&s;t carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between a faculty or power and an habit: An habit is only an in|clination to do a thing; an habit fits a man
<PB N="35" REF="011873_0038_0F87419F8B2EBF48">
to do a thing with more facility and dexte|rity. Habits are not faculties; they do not enable men to do what they could not do before; they di&s;po&s;e and incline the heart that way. A natural man has a prevailing inclination to judge wrong concerning God, and an oppo&s;ition to believe right concerning God; his mind is aver&s;e to the reception of tho&s;e doctrines that the Scripture teaches con|cerning God; but yet he has the faculty or power to judge aright when he is a&s;&s;i&s;ted. And the godly man having received habitual light, has an inclination to judge aright of God and &s;piritual things.</P>
<P><HI>Ar.</HI> 3. This <HI>actual light which men receive from the Spirit of God, doth beget habitual light.</HI> It is in this ca&s;e as in many others; a man that has had experience of the &s;weetne&s;s of honey, is inclined thereby to judge &s;o from time to time: He that has had experience of the &s;altne&s;s of the &s;ea, is inclined to judge it &s;o: And he that has under&s;tood the gloriou&s;ne&s;s of God, is prepared and di&s;po&s;ed thereby to judge &s;o from time to time. This di&s;covery leaves &s;uch a &s;en&s;e and impre&s;&s;ion on the heart, as inclines it for ever to judge &s;o concerning God: They never forget what they have &s;een, and &s;o are inclined to judge after the like man|ner. And the more frequently they have emi|nent di&s;coveries of God and Chri&s;t, the more &s;trongly they are inclined to judge &s;o, and to reject the contrary temptations. Repeated di&s;coveries &s;trengthen the habit, and di&s;po&s;e
<PB N="36" REF="011873_0039_0F8741A021C946D8">
them with more readine&s;s to judge &s;o. The inclination to judge aright of God is a ration|al inclination, flowing from a conviction of the gloriou&s;ne&s;s of God.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> The fir&s;t thing that this Light di&s;covers is the Gloriou&s;ne&s;s of God.</HEAD>
<P>MAny men that have had experience of this &s;piritual light, are able to give a very poor account how it doth at fir&s;t work in their heart The under&s;tanding is &s;o quick in it's operations, that the &s;teps of tho&s;e di&s;coveries that are made to the &s;oul, does not fall un|der their ob&s;ervation. They may be able to give &s;ome account what they &s;aw, that they &s;aw &s;uch and &s;uch encouragement to come to Chri&s;t; but they do not know how they come to be convinced of it. But we have abundant cau&s;e to conclude, that the fir&s;t di&s;|covery that is made is of the <HI>gloriou&s;ne&s;s of God.</HI> The knowledge of God is the foundation of all religion: P&s;al. 36.10. <HI>Stretch forth thy loving kindne&s;s to them that know thee, and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s to the upright in heart.</HI> Joh. 1.3. <HI>This is eternal life to know thee, the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>Two things will make this evident.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 1. The <HI>&s;piritual knowledge of God doth not depend upon the &s;piritual knowledge of other things.</HI> There needs no antecedent di&s;coveries in order to the &s;piritual knowledge of God.
<PB N="37" REF="011873_0040_0F8741A0E7775520">
When God opens the eyes of men, and gives &s;piritual under&s;tanding to them, there are two ways wherein they may &s;ee the glory of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. By <HI>rea&s;oning from the works of Creation and common Providence.</HI> There is a great di&s;|covery of the glory of God in making the world, P&s;al. 19.1. <HI>The heavens declare the glo|ry of God. and the firmament &s;heweth his handy works.</HI> I&s;ai. 6.3. <HI>The whole earth is full of his glory.</HI> And when they behold the work of God, they may readily &s;ee, if their eyes be opened, that the&s;e things were made by a God of infinite power, and wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s. There is a &s;elf-evidencing light in the&s;e works of God, &s;hewing that they are the effects of a God of infinite glory. The world is a gla&s;s, reflecting the glory of God; and when men's eyes are opened, they may plainly &s;ee it. So in other of the great works of God; the gene|ral deluge, the burning of Sodom, the delivery of I&s;rael out of Egypt, maintaining them in the wilderne&s;s, &amp;c. God often puts us in mind, that he has <HI>created the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth.</HI> That is an abundant manife&s;tation to them that under&s;tand, that he is a glorious God, worthy to be believed, and loved, and obeyed. When men's eyes are opened, they &s;ee the force of the argument, they are at once &s;atisfyed about the glorious properties of God. Rea&s;on enlightned by the Spirit of God, teaches men convincingly what God is.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="38" REF="011873_0041_0F8741A19CBF2180">2 <HI>By rea&s;oning from the word of God.</HI> The word of God has a &s;elf evidencing light in it; it &s;hews that it doth proceed from a God of infinite Glory. The holine&s;s of the law, and the wi&s;dom and grace that appears in the go&s;pel, are in them&s;elves very evidential of God's glory. And though multitudes of men that read and hear the word, are not convin|ced of the divine authority of it; yet when God lets in beams of &s;piritual light, they re|ceive it as the <HI>word of God;</HI> they are convin|ced that it proceeds from a God of infinite glory. When God &s;hines into the heart, they &s;ee the <HI>glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.6. <HI>They do with open face behold as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.18. They &s;ay, &s;uch things would never <HI>have ente|red into the heart of man,</HI> if God had not revea|led them, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2 9.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 2. The <HI>&s;piritual knowledge of other things, doth depend on the &s;piritual knowledge of God.</HI> The knowledge of particular revealed truths, doth depend upon the knowledge of God. Until they know God they can have no Faith; Faith depends upon the knowledge of God. Until they know God, they do not &s;ee a foundation for Faith, nor know any thing that is to be known only by Faith. Until men know God, they cannot know the <HI>&s;aving benefit of the blood of Chri&s;t,</HI> or the <HI>Divinity of Chri&s;t,</HI> or the <HI>certainty of the Promi&s;es,</HI> or the <HI>happine&s;s of heaven;</HI> for all <HI>Faith</HI> doth depend upon our a&s;&s;urance of the <HI>faithfulne&s;s of God:</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="011873_0042_0F8741A262C371D0">
But when once we are convinced of the faith|fulne&s;s of God, we are prepared to believe whatever God has revealed. If God reveals things that are beyond natural rea&s;on to com|prehend, as the doctrine of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> and of the <HI>Incarnation of the Son of God;</HI> &s;uch men will believe it. If God reveals things that are very contrary to carnal rea&s;on; As, that God is angry with carnal men, though they live in great pro&s;perity; and that he delights in god|ly men, and will &s;ave them, though they are low, and in great affliction. If he promi&s;es pardon to them that have been very &s;inful, if they accept of the offers of the go&s;pel, &s;uch men will believe it. The con&s;ideration of the everla&s;ting faithfulne&s;s of God, will over|come all objections. If men were at never &s;o much lo&s;s about the truth of them before, and rejected them as fal&s;e, or &s;u&s;pended their belief, looking on them as uncertain; yet as &s;oon as ever he under&s;tands the faithfulne&s;s of God, the darkne&s;s of his mind is removed; he &s;ees a foundation for Faith, and &s;o tho&s;e things which were my&s;teries to him before, are now heartily acknowledged.

<P>MUltitudes that are called to come, do up|on one acca&s;ion or other excu&s;e them|&s;elves:
<PB N="40" REF="011873_0043_0F8741A31C1721B0">
Yea, men that are in great di&s;tre&s;s for the want of forgivene&s;s, do reject the offer. They would fain be pardoned, and pray to God to accept them upon Chri&s;t's account; but they dare not accept of the offer of mercy. They have all manner of per&s;wa&s;ions but re|main unper&s;uadable; they re&s;olve to do it, they may attempt it, but do not effect it: It &s;eems a dangerous thing, and a method to ca&s;t away their own &s;ouls; they think God would be very angry with them for obtruding them|&s;elves upon him: It &s;eems to them a de&s;pe|rate adventure. But when they are <HI>convinced of the gloriou&s;ne&s;s of God, they &s;ee encouragement enough to come to Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;ee three things e&s;pecially that are encouragement to them,</P>
<P N="1">1 The <HI>free Grace of God.</HI> They were wont to di&s;courage them&s;elves becau&s;e of their un|worthine&s;s; it &s;eemed to them as if the heart of God was turn'd again&s;t them, and they la|boured in that, that they might get &s;omething to incline the heart of God towards them, that might appea&s;e his anger, and attract his love: But when they have the knowledge of God, they are &s;atisfied in the freene&s;s of his grace; they &s;ee that there is enough in his own heart to move him, that there is an in|finite ocean of grace there, that his thoughts are not as our thoughts, that there is an <HI>height and depth, and length and breadth in the love of God</HI> that it <HI>pa&s;&s;eth knowledge;</HI> that he can pi|ty his greate&s;t enemies, and love tho&s;e that
<PB N="41" REF="011873_0044_0F8741A5F8AD23D8">
have nothing to commend them. They &s;ay he is God and not man: His mercy does not depend on any excellency in them: His grace is &s;overeign grace, and he has <HI>mercy on whom he will have mercy.</HI> Though it be a great thing to be pardoned and &s;aved, yet it is not too much for him to do. There is no need of any thing to move his heart; he can do it becau&s;e it plea&s;eth him. They were wont formerly to limit the mercy of God, and to think it would have been &s;ufficient, if they had not been &s;uch great &s;inners, or if they were more broken for their &s;ins; but now they are convinced, that if they were wor&s;e than they are, that the mercy of God it &s;ufficient for them; that there is an infinitene&s;s in the grace of God; and after they have reckoned up many things that grace can do, that there is infinitely more than they can think of No badne&s;s doth di&s;courage them, no want of goodne&s;s doth di&s;courage them. There is no more limiting of the grace than of the power of God. There is mercy enough to &s;et a|gain&s;t their unworthine&s;s. P&s;al 36 7. <HI>How excellent is thy loving kindne&s;s O God, therefore the children of men put their tru&s;t under the &s;ha|dow of thy wings.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 The <HI>preciou&s;ne&s;s and &s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The threatnings of the law were a terror to them like a flaming &s;word; they &s;aw ju&s;tice binding them over to con|demnation; they thought that every jot and tittle of the law mu&s;t be fulfilled; as <HI>Mat.</HI>

That Chri&s;t is at the right hand of God, <HI>exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour;</HI> that it is a &s;afe thing to appear before God in his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, there is no need of any additi|on to it. They &s;ay there are un&s;earchable ri|ches in Chri&s;t. Before, they did not know but the doctrine concerning Chri&s;t was a de|lu&s;ion,

<P>THERE is a great deal of difference in this light as to the clearne&s;s of it; all that have this &s;piritual light do not &s;ee things with the like clearne&s;s; the di&s;coveries are more dim in &s;ome than in others.

But no man is able to give an exact account of all that he did &s;ee at that time. The thing was done in
<PB N="45" REF="011873_0048_0F8741A932151350">
the twinkling of an eye; and though men ne|ver forget it, yet they cannot call to mind all that they were convinced of; no, not if they were to give an account the next hour. Men have not at that time the actual under&s;tand|ing of all go&s;pel principles: Indeed they &s;aw that that way of Salvation that they had been for many years in&s;tructed in was true; but they have not the actual under&s;tanding of them at the very time: Yet they did &s;ee, and actu|ally under&s;tood at the time, a great deal more than they can remember.</P>
<P>This may appear by the&s;e things,</P>
<P N="1">1. From the <HI>&s;hortne&s;s of the time</HI> wherein this di&s;covery is made. There is but a very little time between the opening of the eyes, and the hearts clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t, and the di&s;covery is wont to la&s;t but a little time; and &s;o it is impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould have a di&s;tinct re|membrance of every thing that he &s;aw. The <HI>Spou&s;e</HI> gives a very particular de&s;cription of Chri&s;t in figurative expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>Cant.</HI> 5. <HI>from v.</HI> 16. <HI>ad fin</HI> And &s;o Godly men are able to do from what they find in the word of God; but they can remember but a little account of what they &s;aw at that time. If a man ca&s;t up his eyes to heaven, he &s;ees a multitude of &s;tars; but is not able to give a particular account of what he &s;aw of the &s;everal &s;tars and con&s;tella|tions. So, if a man &s;hould ca&s;t his eye upon a beautiful Per&s;on, he is much affected with his beauty; but he can't give a particular account of all his features, the comeline&s;s of his fore|head,
<PB N="46" REF="011873_0049_0F8741A9EFEF9370">
eyes, cheeks and lips, nor give a de&s;crip|tion of them. If a man &s;hould ca&s;t his eye upon a <HI>Garden</HI> wherein their is a variety of flowers, he may be much affected with it, yet not able to tell particularly what &s;orts of flow|ers he &s;aw. Or if he &s;hould ca&s;t his eye up|on a curious piece of <HI>Embroidery,</HI> he may per|ceive immediately that there is much curio&s;ity in it; but he cannot give an account of all the colours and re&s;emblances that he ca&s;t his eye upon. Thus it is when men's eyes are open|ed. They &s;ee the way of &s;alvation to be a glorious way, but they cannot tell particularly all that they &s;aw; they had but a tran&s;ient &s;ight, and could not take &s;uch di&s;tinct notice of things, as to lay them up in their memory.</P>
<P N="2">2. There <HI>is need of the actual knowledge of many go&s;pel Truths, in order to the fir&s;t clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t.</HI> They heard of tho&s;e things of|ten before, but they under&s;tood nothing in a right manner before; but they mu&s;t un|der&s;tand them in order to their clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t. They need to under&s;tand &s;ome|thing of the <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> of that Salvation that is offered. Men will not accept the offer, except they judge it worthy to be accepted. They need to under&s;tand, that the <HI>offer is made to them;</HI> the making of &s;uch on offer to others is no warrant to them to accept thereof. They need to under&s;tand, <HI>their &s;ins may be pardoned;</HI> that the law does not render them uncapable of Pardon. They need to under&s;tand, that it
<PB N="47" REF="011873_0050_0F8741AA9ED23A70">
is God him&s;elf that makes the offer in the Go&s;pel: Nothing, le&s;s than that can be an en|couragement to accept. Men need to under|&s;tand that God has <HI>Mercy</HI> enough to pardon all their Sins, though they have no worthi|ne&s;s: If they do not under&s;tand this, they will not dare to accept the offer. They need to under&s;tand the <HI>Faithfulne&s;s of God,</HI> el&s;e they can &s;ee no &s;afety in coming to Chri&s;t. They need to under&s;tand the <HI>&s;aving Vertue of the blood of Chri&s;t;</HI> that it is acceptable to God, and &s;ufficient to purge away Sin. They need to under&s;tand that Chri&s;t Je&s;us is the <HI>Son of God,</HI> that they may be &s;atisfyed in the divine ver|tue of his blood' They need to under&s;tand, that God <HI>made</HI> him a <HI>Mediator,</HI> and <HI>wounded him for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</HI> They had need to under&s;tand the &s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t to &s;anctify them and make them per&s;evere, and God's ability to fulfil his promi&s;es. And there is no godly man that can recover the remembrance of it, that at that time he &s;aw all the&s;e things. Some can remember more than others; but none can call to mind all that he &s;aw at that time.</P>
<P N="3">3 Becau&s;e at that time men's thoughts are &s;o fixed up <HI>one or two particular things,</HI> that they are hindered thereby from remembring &s;ome other things. Experience &s;hews, that &s;ome men at their fir&s;t conver&s;ion, have their thoughts more fixed on the con&s;ideration of the <HI>free Mercy of God:</HI> They &s;ee a depths of compa&s;&s;ion in the heart of God; that he has
<PB N="48" REF="011873_0051_0F8741AB5DBC6188">
no need of any external motive to draw his heart; that he can overlook all manner of provocations, <HI>has mercy on whom he will, and compa&s;&s;ion on whom he will have compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> as Rom. 9.15. Some men at the time had their thoughts more taken up about the <HI>Sacrifice of Chri&s;t,</HI> how he has born the cur&s;e, bought us with a price, made his Soul an offering for Sin, fully &s;atisfyed the Ju&s;tice of God. And &s;ome others have their thoughts at the time more fixed upon the <HI>Faithfulne&s;s of God,</HI> that his <HI>words are pure words,</HI> that he is <HI>not as a man that he &s;hould lie, nor the Son of man that he &s;hould repent;</HI> that his word is a &s;ure founda|tion to build upon. It is frequently &s;o after|wards. They are led into it &s;ometime by the con&s;ideration of &s;ome <HI>Scripture</HI> that comes to mind at that time. Sometimes by having &s;pecial temptations ju&s;t before; as if God could not find in his heart to pardon &s;uch as they; as if Chri&s;t's blood would not an&s;wer for their Sins, &amp;c. And the thoughts being fixed on one encouragement makes others le&s;s ob&s;erved. If a man takes particular notice of one <HI>Argument</HI> in a di&s;cour&s;e, he can give the le&s;s account of the re&s;t. If a man takes &s;pe|cial notice of what concerns him&s;elf in a di&s;|cour&s;e, he will not take &s;uch particular notice of what concerns others. If there be a great Shew, one per&s;on takes more notice of one particular, another of another, and are not able to give to good an account of the other things that they &s;aw.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> This Spiritual Light doth di&s;cover tho&s;e things that Men were convinced of be|fore, under the Work of Preparation, and that in a better manner than they &s;aw them before.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore God converts men, it is his manner to prepare them for it by a common work of his Spirit, which is called <HI>Preparatory,</HI> which puts men upon it to to be &s;en&s;ibly &s;eeking after reconciliation. Men are called upon to <HI>&s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God and his righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> to <HI>labour not for the meat that peri&s;hes, but for that meat that doth endure unto eternal life.</HI> And men are blamed for &s;lightly &s;eeking, <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.24. Many &s;eek and are not able to enter. And that was the happine&s;s of &s;ome, their hearts were mightily &s;et in &s;eeking the king|dom of God, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.13 Men are labour|ing, &s;ome a long while for peace with God before they are converted: They are convin|ced of the vanity of the world, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of the favour of God and eternal life: They are convinced al&s;o of the in&s;ufficiency of their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o as to relinqui&s;h hopes from that, but when God &s;ets in &s;piri|tual light to convert men, that doth di&s;co|ver the &s;ame that they &s;aw under the work of preparation, and that after a better manner than they &s;aw them before,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="50" REF="011873_0053_0F8741AE14834820">1 When God gives &s;piritual light and re|veals his Grace and the Glory of Chri&s;t to the Soul, that <HI>di&s;covers tho&s;e things that they &s;aw un|der the work of preparation.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 That will di&s;cover the <HI>terriblene&s;s of Dam|nation.</HI> One thing that Sinners are &s;en&s;ible of under the work of preparation is, that the wrath of God is terrible: And they are wont to cry out as he, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved.</HI> Act. 16.30. And as <HI>David, There is no &s;ound|ne&s;s in my fle&s;h becau&s;e of thine anger, nor any re&s;t in my bones becau&s;e of my &s;in,</HI> P&s;al. 48.3. They &s;ee they, have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the heavy wrath of God, and are liable to damnation, which is intolerable. I&s;ai. 33.14. <HI>Who can dwell with devouring fire, who can dwell with everla&s;ting burnings?</HI> And the &s;en&s;e of this is wont to fill them with <HI>Terror;</HI> they are afraid of dying quickly, and they are urged in &s;pirit to cry to God, and beg the pardon of their Sins. This &s;tirs them up carefully to reform their lives, and leave off all &s;inful practices, and to re&s;i&s;t temptations. This makes them &s;en&s;ible of the vanity of the world. And when go&s;pel light is let into men, they will &s;ee the terriblene&s;s of the wrath of God for Sin. If they did not &s;ee that, they would not &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of coming to Chri&s;t for Salvation; but when they &s;ee the truth of the Go&s;pel, they will be convinced of that; for then they will &s;ee the faithfulne&s;s of God, and the truth of the threatnings of the law: Then they
<PB N="51" REF="011873_0054_0F8741AE5E9F37D8">
will believe the greatne&s;s of Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings, and thereby &s;ee the terrible wrath of God for Sin. Luk. 23.31. <HI>If the&s;e things be done in the green tree, what &s;hall be done in the dry?</HI> In the &s;orrows of Chri&s;t they will di&s;cern how intol|erable the wrath of God is, and what need there is of deliverance from it.</P>
<P N="2">2 That will di&s;cover the <HI>vanity and in&s;uffici|ency of men's own righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Under the work of preparation they are by degrees led into the under&s;tanding of their own unworthi|ne&s;s, that they can do nothing to pacify the wrath, or merit the favour of God. When &s;inners are in di&s;tre&s;s of con&s;cience, they are wont to labor to lay &s;ome bonds on the ju&s;tice, or faithfulne&s;s, or mercy of God; and in length of time God is wont to &s;hew them that their righteou&s;ne&s;s dont an&s;wer the law, &s;atisfies for no Sin, cannot draw the heart of God to them; that by their be&s;t works they are meriting con|demnation; that their hearts are full of en|mity to God; that they have no power to do any good; that they have nothing of their own to depend upon, but &s;tand in need of free grace and the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t: And when the go&s;pel light is let into them, that teaches them the emptine&s;s of their own works. When men &s;ee the excellency of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, they &s;ee it is a vain thing for them to think to pacify God them|&s;elves; they &s;hall never be able to get any thing of their own that is comparable to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t: That alone will &s;erve
<PB N="52" REF="011873_0055_0F8741B1396CC670">
their turn, and they have no need of any other. Phil. 3.7. <HI>What things were gain to me, tho&s;e I counted lo&s;s for Chri&s;t.</HI> When men &s;ee their own hearts under the work of <HI>Humiliation,</HI> they &s;ee the vanity of their own righteou&s;ne&s;s; but when they &s;ee the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, they &s;ee further into the vanity of it, and pre|fer Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and count <HI>their own</HI> as <HI>dung</HI> in compari&s;on with Chri&s;t's Phil. 3.8. <HI>And count them but dung that I may win Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. They are convinced of the&s;e things af|ter a <HI>better manner</HI> than they are under the work of preparation. Under the work of preparation, they are convinced of them by the illuminations of <HI>natural Con&s;cience.</HI> They &s;ee there is great danger of damnation, and that damnation is intolerable, and that the world is vain; that their own righteou&s;ne&s;s cannot draw the heart of God; that it is ju&s;t with God to de&s;troy them. And &s;ome things they are convinced of by <HI>Experience;</HI> as, that they are blind, and under the dominion of their &s;ins, that they are <HI>dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins.</HI> But when &s;piritual light is let into them, they know the&s;e things after a better manner, then they &s;ee the&s;e by faith; they believe the te&s;ti|mony of God in his word, and this has a bet|ter affect upon the heart. He &s;ees &s;o much of the world, that he hates a worldly &s;pirit; he &s;ees the vanity of a worldly &s;pirit, &s;o that it is mortified ever after; and the vanity of his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hates a &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit.</P>

Yea, they dare not &s;tay away from Chri&s;t, they would not for a world &s;tay away from Chri&s;t: <HI>Satan</HI> with all his artifices cannot per&s;wade them to neglect Chri&s;t. They have been in great di&s;tre&s;s, and now they &s;ee the re|lief that is provided for them; they are under a nece&s;&s;ity in their own &s;pirits to accept the call. In like manner when they &s;ee the glo|riou&s;ne&s;s of God, they are able to love him. They were before urged in con&s;cience to do it, and had abundance of arguments &s;et before them to induce them to love him; but nothing would prevail upon them, becau&s;e they were &s;trangers to the loveline&s;s of God: But as &s;oon as ever their eyes were opened to &s;ee the glo|rious grace of God in the go&s;pel, now they can love him.

When men &s;ee the preciou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, it mightily &s;uits them to come to him; they take a complacency in com|ing to Chri&s;t. Some men force them&s;elves after a fa&s;hion to venture on Chri&s;t; but when they &s;ee the divine authority of the go&s;pel, they love to come to him, as the hungry, man loves to eat, and the thir&s;ty drink. Act 16, 34. <HI>He rejoiced, believing in God.</HI> He &s;ees that that makes it plea&s;ant to him; he &s;ees that God is worthy of that honour. He is a God of &s;uch grace and faithfulne&s;s, that he is worthy to be tru&s;ted in; and he &s;ees that the honour of a glorious Mediator is due to Chri&s;t; and he &s;ees that it is a &s;afe thing to come to Chri&s;t. There is no re&s;t any where el&s;e for the &s;ole of his foot, but Chri&s;t is a &s;ure foun|dation, a precious corner &s;tone: His heart takes contentment in relying upon him: All the world &s;hall not per&s;wade him to for&s;ake him, and make choice of any other refuge. I&s;ai. 45.24. <HI>Surely &s;hall one &s;ay, in the Lord have I righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength.</HI> So, the man loves to make the glory of God his end; and he loves to aba&s;e him&s;elf before God, and look upon him&s;elf as vanity, and nothing in compari&s;on of God. The &s;ight of the excellency of God and Chri&s;t draws his heart; and he loves the&s;e holy carriages. There was an antipathy a|gain&s;t them in his heart before; but now God and Chri&s;t are lovely in his eyes, and he has a mind to come to Chri&s;t, and to honor God,

and he will not be re&s;trained; for &s;uch carri|ages are plea&s;ant to him. The glory of God and Chri&s;t draws the heart &s;weetly and pow|erfully, and he rejoiceth therein.</P>
<P N="3">3 This &s;piritual light <HI>makes the heart &s;tand bent that way.</HI> This doth not only draw forth gracious actings, but leaves an Impre&s;&s;ion and bias upon the heart that way. Beauty draws forth an act of Love, and leaves a di&s;po&s;ition to love. This &s;ight changes the mind and makes men judge otherwi&s;e of God and Chri&s;t than they u&s;ed to do, and it changes the heart and inclines it to carry &s;uitably. The con|viction is an abiding conviction, and &s;o the di&s;po&s;ition is abiding.

Holy actions are never forced. Men may be under a nece&s;&s;ity to love God and tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, but that nece&s;&s;ity does not ari&s;e from compul&s;ion but from inclination. P&s;al. 110.3. <HI>Thy People &s;hall be willing in the day of thy pow|er.</HI> Before the man had aver&s;ion to tho&s;e gracious actions, he was under the diminion of a contrary inclination, but when he doth them, he is inclined to do them; and that <HI>ac|tual inclination</HI> leaves an <HI>habitual inclination</HI> on the heart that way. We indeed commonly &s;ay that one act does not make a habit; but we mean that one act doth not make a more perfect habit; as <HI>habit</HI> is di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> which is called <HI>habitus imperfectus.</HI> But one act commonly doth leave &s;omething of an inclination that way: one act of love to another per&s;on or thing di&s;po&s;es the heart to renew that act of love. One act is prepara|tion for another of the &s;ame kind; One act of faith puts the Soul into a believing frame: and one act of humility into an humble frame; he is more inclined to believe again than he was, and the clearer di&s;covery he had of God and Chri&s;t, the more &s;trongly he doth believe, and the greater inclination doth remain in him to believe.</P>

God gives common conviction, he works up|on rea&s;on; and when he gives &s;piritual con|viction, he likewi&s;e works upon rea&s;on. Be|&s;ides, &s;piritual conviction is rational convicti|on: Godly men act under&s;tandingly and ra|tionally, when they judge God to be worthy to be tru&s;ted, loved and obeyed; when they judge Chri&s;t to be the eternal Son of God, and an all-&s;ufficient Saviour. Yet the <HI>di&s;|tinction</HI> may be allowed if it be thus explained; that <HI>rational conviction</HI> is that which men by their natural rea&s;on do attain; which they may gain by the force of their natural rea&s;on, improving the works and word of God; which differs very much from that conviction which men have by the &s;aving work of God's Spirit. <HI>Common Illumination</HI> is of <HI>two &s;orts;</HI> one is from the more common improvements of natural rea&s;on, the other from more affecting di&s;cove|ries wrought by a common work of the Spi|rit of God. There is a conviction that ri|&s;eth from the common improvement of natural rea&s;on. Thus men &s;ee clearly the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> religion is better than the <HI>Popi&s;h:</HI> That it mu&s;t needs be a work of wonderful wi&s;dom and power to make the world, that the &s;acri|fice of the Son of God mu&s;t needs be of great value, that it was great love for God to give his Son to die: And hundreds of things of the like nature.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e rational convictions there are <HI>affecting di&s;coveries</HI> of divine truths by the <HI>com|mon work of the &s;pirit</HI> which make for a time
<PB N="65" REF="011873_0068_0F8740E1A01AEEE0">
con&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion on the heart. Luk. 14.15 <HI>When one of them that &s;at at meat with him heard the&s;e things, he &s;aid unto him, Ble&s;&s;ed is he that &s;hall eat bread in the kingdom of God;</HI> Mat. 13.20. <HI>He that received the &s;eed into &s;tony places, the &s;ame is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it.</HI> 2 Pet. 2.20 <HI>For if after they have e&s;caped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they are intangled therein and overcome:</HI> Heb. 1.4, 5.6 <HI>For it is impo&s;&s;ible for them that were one inlightened, and have ta&s;ted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Gho&s;t, and hath ta&s;ted the good word of God and the pow|ers of the world to come, if they fall away, to re|new them again to repentance.</HI></P>
<P>The two &s;orts of illumination, are re&s;em|blances of a <HI>twofold &s;piritual Illumination</HI> that &s;aints have. One is by &s;anctified rea&s;on, whereby men are convinced of divine truths. Men under&s;tand the divine authority of the Scripture, and thereby they are a&s;&s;ured of the truth of Promi&s;es and Threatnings: They are a&s;&s;ured that God made the world, and from thence they are convinced of his eternal Power and Godhead: They know that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the eternal Son of God, and thereby they know the &s;aving vertue of his Blood.</P>
<P>The other is by &s;pecial di&s;coveries of divine truths. They are led into <HI>Chri&s;t's chambers,</HI> as the phra&s;e is, <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.4. God breaks into the heart by divine light, and gives great di&s;|coveries of his faithfulne&s;s, of his holine&s;s, his
<PB N="66" REF="011873_0069_0F8740E32BD70D90">
grace, the delight he takes in the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t, and many other things. 2 Cor. 4.6. <HI>God hath &s;hined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> Both the&s;e ways of conviction &s;eem to be intimated, Eph. 1.17. <HI>That God may give unto you, the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and reve|lation in the knowledge of him.</HI></P>
<P>The difference between tho&s;e convictions that ri&s;e from the improvement of natural rea|&s;on, and that do ari&s;e from &s;piritual rea&s;on, lies in the&s;e two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Natural rea&s;on <HI>doth not di&s;cover the Cer|tainty of divine things.</HI> Sanctified rea&s;on doth &s;ee them to be <HI>&s;ure,</HI> Joh. 6.69. <HI>We believe and are &s;ure, that thou art Chri&s;t the Son of the living God.</HI> Joh. 17.8. <HI>They have known that I came from thee, and they have believed that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me.</HI> Heb. 11.1. <HI>Faith is the evidence of things not &s;een.</HI> 1 The&s;. 2 13. <HI>They received the word not as the word of man, but as it is in|deed the word of God.</HI> But natural rea&s;on doth not di&s;cover the <HI>Certainty</HI> of divine truths: That can perceive the connection between one divine truth and another, and perceive how one thing follows certainly from another; but it doth not perceive the certainty of any. Carnal mens rea&s;oning is from &s;uppo&s;ition; they rea&s;on very rationally, but they do not &s;ee that which is the foundation of their rea|&s;oning to be certain. Carnal men and Godly men do both of them argue from the divine Nature of Chri&s;t. Both carnal men and God|ly
<PB N="67" REF="011873_0070_0F8740E3E1313528">
do &s;trongly argue, that if Chri&s;t be the Son of God, there is a divine vertue in his &s;uff|erings; and that it is &s;afe relying on him. But here lies the difference; the godly man <HI>knows</HI> that Chri&s;t is the Son of God, <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.6. but the carnal man <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> that Chri&s;t is the Son of God. He &s;ays the Church believe it, the Old and New Te&s;tament give an account of it, and there be many things &s;aid that make much for the confirmation of it. He di&s;covered the &s;ecret thot's of men, did many miraculous works, ro&s;e from the dead.</P>
<P>Upon &s;uch account he &s;uppo&s;es him to be the Son of God, and judges it a heinous crime for any to deny it; out he doth not know the&s;e things, for he is ignorant of the divine authority of the word, and dare not venture on Chri&s;t, for fear it &s;hould not be &s;o. So it was with the <HI>Jews,</HI> they did not believe <HI>Mo|&s;es.</HI> Joh. 5.46. Thus they both of them ar|gue from the <HI>Types</HI> and <HI>Sacraments.</HI> The god|ly man argues, that there were &s;everal types in&s;tituted by God, to &s;hew the &s;aving vertue of the blood of Chri&s;t; and the &s;acraments in the <HI>New-Te&s;tament</HI> are in&s;tituted to be a memorial of Chri&s;t, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.24. The god|ly man argues from hence, that Chri&s;t has &s;atisfied the ju&s;tice of God; that Chri&s;t was the lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.7. The&s;e &s;acrifices were on|ly types of Chri&s;t, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.17. And he is abun|dantly &s;atisfied by the&s;e in&s;titutions, that Chri&s;t is a glorious Saviour. Another man ar|gues in like manner, that God would never
<PB N="68" REF="011873_0071_0F8740E6A8043788">
have appointed &s;uch Signs to &s;ignify Chri&s;t, if he would not have us tru&s;t in him. He has not appointed the&s;e &s;igns to deceive us; God would never teach his people a fal&s;e way of Salvation: But his wound is, that he does not know certainly the divine authority of tho&s;e in&s;titutions; he doth not know but they were the inventions of men. So, they both of them argue &s;trongly from the command to believe, from the promi&s;es of Salvation in a way of believing, from Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion and &s;itting at the right hand of God; but the carnal man is uncertain of tho&s;e things that are foundations of his rea&s;oning; he does not know but there is &s;ome mi&s;take: He thinks that there is a great probability of the truth of tho&s;e things, but he has no a&s;&s;urance: His principles are ground|ed on an uncertain propo&s;ition; and &s;o he <HI>knows nothing as he ought to know.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 Carnal rea&s;on doth not <HI>receive a right idea of divine things.</HI> Godly men though they have the exerci&s;e of &s;piritual rea&s;on, cannot find out the Almighty unto perfection: But yet they do know God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Joh.</HI> 17.3. They have a true idea of God; they know him to be one of infinite perfection; they know him to be a God of infinite power, grace and faithfulne&s;s; they are convinced that he is worthy of that love, faith and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion that he calls for; P&s;al. 18.3. <HI>I will call upon God who is worthy to be prai&s;ed.</HI> They know that divine honour is due to him; P&s;al. 29.2. <HI>Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his
<PB N="69" REF="011873_0072_0F8740E806748AC8">
name.</HI> But carnal men have not a right idea of God: They acknowledge that he is infinite in his perfections, and can give &s;ome de&s;crip|tion of his infinite perfections; but they have not a right <HI>Idea</HI> of his glorious nature, are not &s;en&s;ible what reverence and glory is due to him; and therefore they are &s;aid to be igno|rant of him: Joh. 4.8. <HI>He that loveth not, knoweth not God.</HI></P>
<P>The difference between tho&s;e affecting illu|minations that carnal men have, and tho&s;e di&s;|coveries that are given to godly men, lies in the&s;e two particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. The illuminations that carnal men have, are <HI>affecting,</HI> but not <HI>convincing.</HI> They are many times much affected with <HI>Joy;</HI> &s;o they &s;aid, <HI>What a ble&s;&s;edne&s;s is it!</HI> when <HI>Paul</HI> preach|ed the go&s;pel unto them, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.15. It works de&s;ires in them, <HI>Luk.</HI> 14, 15. And their hearts upon that occa&s;ion may be mightily weaned from the world, and taken up about heavenly things: They may be mightily tran&s;ported with zeal. The people of the <HI>Jews</HI> were &s;o affected with Chri&s;t, that they were of the mind to <HI>make him a King.</HI> But the&s;e illuminations does not convince them; the men remain ignorant of God, and Chri&s;t, and the truth of the go&s;pel. The&s;e fla&s;hes of light do not di&s;cover the certainty of divine truths.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> Conver&s;ion may be known.</HEAD>
<P>MEN may have knowledge of their own Conver&s;ion. The knowledge that o|ther men have of it is uncertain; becau&s;e no man can look into the heart of another, and &s;ee the workings of grace there: Yet men may know that they are godly. Some ungod|ly think that they have grace; but that which is not, cannot be known: Things that are not, are called, <HI>things that do not appear,</HI> Heb. 11.3. <HI>That which is wanting cannot be number|ed.</HI> Eccl. 1.15. All converted men do not know that they are converted. Though grace be vi&s;ible, yet many times it is not &s;een. Vi&s;i|ble things are not always &s;een; &s;ometimes becau&s;e it is night, &s;ometimes becau&s;e they are covered. It is the <HI>Calamity,</HI> and many times
<PB N="73" REF="011873_0076_0F8740EB490DEEA0">
the <HI>Iniquity</HI> of godly men, that they are igno|rant of their conver&s;ion. They do know that they have corruptions in them, and they may know that they have grace in them. This is very evident, becau&s;e many godly men have known their good e&s;tate. If this knowledge had never been attained, it might more rea&s;onably be que&s;tioned, whether it were at|tainable. <HI>Job</HI> was abundantly &s;atisfied; Job 10.7. <HI>Thou knowe&s;t that I am not wicked:</HI> And he was not mi&s;taken, <HI>Job.</HI> 1.1. So <HI>David</HI> knew it; P&s;al. 17.15. <HI>As for me, I &s;hall behold his face in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> So <HI>Paul;</HI> 2 Tim. 4 7. <HI>I have fought the good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the faith.</HI> v. 8. <HI>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And we do not know of one godly man in the <HI>Scripture</HI> that was under darkne&s;s about his &s;incerity. There be &s;ome Scriptures brought to prove the contrary, e&s;pecially &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of <HI>P&s;al,</HI> 88 But that <HI>P&s;alm</HI> repre&s;ents to us not the particular ca&s;e of <HI>Haman,</HI> but of the <HI>Church of I&s;rael</HI></P>
<P>Further, it appears that conver&s;ion may be known, becau&s;e we are directed to <HI>examine our &s;elves</HI> in order to it; 2 Cor. 13 5, <HI>examine your|&s;elves whether you be in the faith, prove your own &s;elves; know you not that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is in you except ye be reprobates.</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10. <HI>Give diligence to make your calling and election &s;ure,</HI> And to what purpo&s;e &s;hould we be advi&s;ed to do a thing that is not doable? God does not advi&s;e us to impo&s;&s;ibilities. All the command of God are po&s;&s;ible to be fulfilled; if not perfect|ly,
<PB N="74" REF="011873_0077_0F8740EBC9CD1050">
yet they may be fulfilled: Phil. 4.13. <HI>I can do all things through Chri&s;t, who &s;trength|neth me.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only add that con&s;ideration&punc; that God makes many comfortable <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> to them that have grace; <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.7. 1 <HI>Jam.</HI> 12. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 3.10. But if men could not know that they have grace, that would fru&s;trate the de&s;ign of the&s;e promi&s;es; that would take away the foun|dation of their comfort; they would be unca|pable of making application of the promi&s;es to them&s;elves. How much happine&s;s &s;oever is made over to them in tho&s;e promi&s;es; yet if they could not know their own grace, they mu&s;t be &s;trangers to their own happine&s;s, and not rejoice in the good that is made over to them.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>How may a godly man know that he has grace?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1 He cannot know it in a way of <HI>Ar|guing.</HI> We come to the knowledge of many things in a way of rea&s;oning; arguing from things known, to things that are not known. Thus a man may know his ju&s;tification: He may argue thus, He that hath faith in Chri&s;t is ju&s;tified; or he that has love to God is ju&s;tified; or he that loves the brethren is pa&s;&s;ed from death to life: Becau&s;e there is a certain connection between the&s;e graces and a &s;tate of ju&s;tification. Thus a man may know by rea&s;oning, that he had this and that parti|cular grace: He may argue &s;o, If I have the grace of faith, I have the grace of love, or hu|mility; becau&s;e there is a concatenation of
<PB N="75" REF="011873_0078_0F8740EC2DD137B0">
graces, and they are in&s;eperable one from another: But they do not know that they are gracious in this manner; the knowledge of their graces does not come in at that door.</P>
<P N="1">1 He cannot prove it from any &s;uch acts as may proceed from other principles: A moral and religious conver&s;ation may proceed from other principles: Such a conver&s;ation is an ar|gument to other men to be charitable, but it is no demon&s;tration. The young man in the go&s;pel walked exactly; Mat. 19.20 <HI>All the&s;e things have I done from my youth. Paul</HI> was con&s;ciencious; Phil. 3.6. <HI>Touching the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s that is in the Law I was blamele&s;s:</HI> Such a walk may proceed from fear of hell and hope of heaven. Zeal for God does not prove it; There may be zeal where there is no love: The <HI>Jews</HI> were great enemies to Chri&s;t, yet very zealous; Rom 10.2. <HI>I bear them record, that they have a zeal for God. Paul</HI> had great zeal before he had any grace. Natural con&s;ci|ence may produce zeal. Great affections does not prove it: The <HI>Jews</HI> cryed, <HI>Ho&s;anna to the Son of David.</HI> Striving again&s;t a &s;elf-righte|ous &s;pirit does not prove it: Men may &s;trive again&s;t it, yet not mortify it. A&s;&s;ociating with godly men does not prove it: <HI>Achitophe.</HI> was <HI>David</HI>'s companion, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 55.14. Sorrows for the afflictions of the Church, and de&s;ires for the conver&s;ion of Souls does not prove it: The&s;e things may be found in carnal men, and &s;o can be no evidences of grace. Tho&s;e things that are common to &s;aints and hypocrites, does
<PB N="76" REF="011873_0079_0F8740ECE94A4C18">
not prove that a man is a &s;aint and no hypo|crite. Men mu&s;t do more than carnal men to prove that they have grace: Mat. 5.10 <HI>Ex|cept your righteou&s;ne&s;s do exceed the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;cribes and Phari&s;ees, you &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into the kingdom of heaven.</HI> That which is common to hypocrites is no &s;ign of &s;aint&s;hip. It is a vain thing to make that a plea, that <HI>Publicans</HI> may plead as well as they, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.46, 47. That which may ri&s;e from a corrupt principle, will not prove a gracious principle; that which a bea&s;t may do, will not prove a thing to be a man.</P>
<P N="2">2 He cannot prove it from any &s;uch acts of Providence as are common to carnal men. Some men have &s;miling providences, and great deliverances. God is very bountiful; and many argue from thence that they are godly; but they do not argue &s;trongly: God may &s;mile on men here, and frown on them in the day of Judgment. Jude 5. <HI>The Lord having <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the people out of the Land of Egypt, afterwards de|&s;troyed them who believed not.</HI> Pro&s;perity is no &s;ign of the <HI>true Church</HI> nor of men's being members of the my&s;tical Church. So, if God do the thing for men that they pray for, that, is no argument: Many prayers are granted that are not accepted. God hears the cry of the <HI>Ravens:</HI> God heard the voice of <HI>I&s;hmael.</HI> Sometimes God denies men's prayers becau&s;e they a&s;k ami&s;s, but not always. Men may be in&s;truments of a great deal of good in the Church, and in the common wealth; yet be

de&s;titute of grace. <HI>Saul</HI> did a great deal of &s;ervice in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> 2 Sam. 1.24. <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> may be in|&s;truments of the conver&s;ion of &s;inners and the comfort of &s;aints, yet not be godly. There were &s;everal godly in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> under the mini&s;try of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees;</HI> and the <HI>Ravens</HI> brought meat to <HI>Elijah.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 They do not know it by <HI>believing that they are godly.</HI> We know many things <HI>by faith:</HI> Heb. 11.1. <HI>By faith we under&s;tand that the worlds were made by the power of God Faith is the evidence of things not &s;een,</HI> Heb. 11.</P>
<P N="1">1 Thus men know the Trinity of Per&s;ons in the Godhead; that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God; that he that believes in him will have eternal life; the re&s;urrection of the dead. And if God &s;hould tell a &s;aint that he hath Grace, he might know it by believing the word of God. But it is not in this way that godly men do know that they have grace: It is not revealed in the word; and the &s;pirit of God doth not te&s;tify it to particular per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Some think the Spirit doth te&s;tify it to &s;ome; and they ground it on Rom. 8.16. <HI>The Spirit it&s;elf beareth witne&s;s with our Spirit, that we are the children of God.</HI> They think the &s;pirit re|veals it by giving an inward te&s;timony to it. And &s;ome godly men think they have had ex|perience of it; but they may ea&s;ily mi&s;take. When the &s;pirit of God doth eminently &s;tir up a &s;pirit of faith and &s;heds abroad the love of God in the heart, it is ea&s;y to mi&s;take it for a te&s;timony. And that is not the meaning of
<PB N="78" REF="011873_0081_0F8740EEEED65F28">
<HI>Paul</HI>'s words. The <HI>Spirit</HI> reveals things to us, by opening our eyes to &s;ee what is reveal|ed in the word: But the &s;pirit doth not reveal new truths not revealed in the word. The Spirit di&s;covers the grace of God in Chri&s;t, and thereby draws forth &s;pecial actings of faith and love, which are evidential; but it doth not not work in way of te&s;timony. If God do but help us to receive the revelations in the word, we &s;hall have comfort enough without new revelations.</P>
<P><HI>Paul</HI>'s meaning is, that the miraculous works of the Spirit are a witne&s;s to the Chri&s;tian re|ligion. The thing that is witne&s;&s;ed is, that <HI>&s;incere Chri&s;tians are the children of God;</HI> that the Chri&s;tian religion is the true religion; and that all that embrace it indeed are the heirs of eternal life: And the Per&s;on that witne&s;&s;eth is the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> he te&s;tifies to it by <HI>Miracles</HI> and <HI>extraordinary Gifts.</HI> The mighty works of the Spirit of God in the primitive times, were evidences of the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion; they were wrought for that very end. Heb. 2 4. <HI>God al&s;o bearing them witne&s;s with &s;igns and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> 1.

<P N="3">3 It is <HI>by Intuition or &s;eeing of grace in their own hearts.</HI> It is by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; as <HI>Peter</HI> knew his love to Chri&s;t, when he &s;ays, <HI>Lord, thou knowe&s;t all things, thou knowe&s;t that I love thee,</HI> Joh. 11.17. And as <HI>David</HI> knew his love

to God; P&s;al. 116.1. <HI>I love the Lord,</HI> And as <HI>Job</HI> knew his repentance; Job. 42.6. <HI>I ab|hor my &s;elf in du&s;t and a&s;hes,</HI> And as <HI>Paul</HI> knew that he <HI>knew Chri&s;t;</HI> 1. Tim. 1.12. <HI>I know whom I have believed.</HI> There is a reflecting power in man: As he can look out and &s;ee external objects, &s;o he can <HI>look in,</HI> and &s;ee his <HI>own actions.</HI> In this manner &s;aints know the <HI>corrupt workings</HI> of their own hearts: They know their pride, and worldline&s;s, and fro|wardne&s;s, and unbelief; &s;o they know their grace. In this manner they know their natural actions; they know that they think, and what they think about; they know the acts of their wills, what they cau&s;e and what they refu&s;e; and the acts of their Affections; they know that they love their children; that they de&s;ire meat and drink; that they are a|fraid of pain and death; that they rejoice in their good things: So, they may have the knowledge by intuition, that they know God and Chri&s;t; that they receive the go&s;pel; that they love God and the &s;aints; that they are &s;orry for their &s;ins. A godly man under|&s;tanding what it is to love God and to repent, though he cannot give an exact definition of them, yet may be able by his ob&s;ervation to know that he doth &s;o; and may be as able to &s;ay, that he loves God, and believes in Chri&s;t, as to &s;ay, he has pride and worldline&s;s in his own heart. There may indeed be &s;ome|thing or more difficulty in it, becau&s;e many actings of grace are low and weak; on that
<PB N="80" REF="011873_0083_0F8740F21DAA5858">
account; it may be hard to &s;ee it; as it is hard to &s;ee the motion of water in a river, when it moves very &s;lowly; and up|on that account, becau&s;e <HI>grace is much coun|terfeited;</HI> and there be many actings that do look like the actings of grace that are not &s;o: But &s;ometimes grace works &s;o powerfully, that it is <HI>very vi&s;ible;</HI> and men are able to di&s;|tingui&s;h between grace and the re&s;emblance of it, and be &s;atisfied under&s;tandingly: 1 Chron. 29.17. <HI>As for me, in the uprightne&s;s of my heart. I willingly offered all the&s;e things.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, it may be of great u&s;e for <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> frequently to be giving <HI>&s;igns of Grace.</HI> The&s;e &s;igns are of great u&s;e for the di&s;covery of hypocri&s;y. The want of particu|lar graces is a means to di&s;cover &s;ome. Some may be undeceived by con&s;idering, that they have not had an antecedent work of <HI>Humilia|tion.</HI> The account of the way wherein God works grace, <HI>&s;c.</HI> by the <HI>di&s;coveries of Go&s;pel Grace,</HI> may convince others. The want of <HI>Obedience</HI> may convince others. So, the al|lowing of pride or worldline&s;s, and the want of doing duties out of regard to God's glory.</P>
<P>But <HI>Signs</HI> al&s;o are of great u&s;e for the incou|ragement and &s;trengthning of the &s;aints. Some|times the di&s;cour&s;ing of &s;uch things doth draw forth the exerci&s;e of Grace; and men find in them&s;elves that which they are hearing of.

<P>If it were beyond the power of God to con|vert, or beyond the grace of God to pardon you, then you would have rea&s;on to be di&s;cou|raged. Men may not expect impo&s;&s;ibilities; but God can renew his image within you. The &s;oul of a man is a &s;uitable &s;ubjection grace; and as long as the faculties of the &s;oul do re|main, a capacity to be gracious doth remain. Your corruptions are accidental, and &s;o may be mortified. Your mind cannot be &s;o blind, a to be incapable of light. Your heart can|not be &s;o hard as to be uncapable to be made &s;oft. If your corruptions are very &s;trong, om|nipotency can overcome them. Mat. 19.26. <HI>With God all things are po&s;&s;ible.</HI> Neither is it beyond the grace of God to pardon you. It is great folly to &s;et limits to that which is in|finite. God's grace exceeds man's &s;infulne&s;s: His <HI>thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as our ways;</HI> but high above them, as the heavens are above the earth. Indeed if God had revealed, that he would not pardon you, that would cut off all hope; but there is no &s;uch thing in the word.

Sometimes God &s;ware concerning <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> that they &s;hould not <HI>enter into his re&s;t,</HI> P&s;al. 95.11. but there is no &s;uch thing &s;aid concerning you. God &s;ometimes pronounces that cur&s;e, <HI>Let him that is unju&s;t be unju&s;t &s;till, and him that is filthy be filthy &s;till,</HI> Rev. 22.11. but he is u&s;ing means with you &s;till. You may take notice of &s;ome dark appearances in Providence; that you are of &s;uch an age; that God has refu&s;ed hitherto to hear your prayers; that in the days when many have heard the voice of the Son of God, you have been left; But it is unwarrantable and pre&s;umptuous, without Scripture or Rea|&s;on, to draw any dark conclu&s;ions from thence.</P>
<P N="3">3 If <HI>you be &s;triving, there is a great deal of hope that you will obtain.</HI> If men are &s;triving, and will not be di&s;couraged, it is very hopeful that they will in time be converted; e&s;pecial|ly if they be directed aright, and be not flat|tered; for diligent &s;eeking is God's way; God's voice unto men is, <HI>Seek ye my face;</HI> P&s;al. 27.8. So, <HI>Seek the Lord and his face, &s;eek his &s;trength evermore;</HI> P&s;al. 105.4. There is hope that God will own men, when they take the directions of his word. Though natural men when they &s;eek conver&s;ion, always do it with a &s;elfi&s;h and hypocritical Spirit, and God does not accept it as &s;ervice to him&s;elf; yet it is not &s;trange he &s;hould ble&s;s his own <HI>appoint|ments.</HI> Indeed the &s;eeking of God diligently, reforming men's lives, &s;earching into the way of Salvation, has a great tendency to pro|mote Salvation; for it takes them off from their &s;inful practices, and worldly de&s;igns that hin|dered them from getting into the way of

life. They are &s;earching into tho&s;e things that will conduce to their conver&s;ion. Be&s;ides, when men are earne&s;tly &s;eeking after that, it is a &s;ign that the Spirit of God is at work with them: And the Spirit is promi&s;ed to make the means of Grace effectual. Joh. 16.7, 8. <HI>If I depart, I will &s;end the Comforter to you; and when he is come he will reprove the world of Sin, of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of Judgment.</HI> And when he doth intend to Convert, his way is, fir&s;t to convince of &s;in; and when he doth convince of &s;in, many times it is in order to conver&s;ion. And indeed many per&s;ons have had experience that in a way of labouring after conver&s;ion, God has &s;hewed mercy on them; while others that have been carele&s;s and &s;lighty, have continued in an unconver|ted condition. Many that have been &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate have obtained; and it is always &s;o, that where there is in any place, an earne&s;t de&s;ire to be &s;eeking after peace with God, many do obtain mercy; and if that &s;pirit &s;hould continue longer, many more might obtain, according to that, Mat. 11.12. <HI>The kingdom of heaven &s;uffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</HI></P>

the glory of the world. When you called to mind the doleful condition of &s;uch men, you would look upon them objects of commi&s;erati|on; their jollity, and wealth, and grandure, would not reconcile you to their condition: You would remember the wormwood and the gall: You would think of the vanity of their hopes, the dolefulne&s;s of their death, and their eternal confu&s;ion; and their &s;tate would be matter of horror to you. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> dreaded to <HI>return to the hou&s;e of Jonathan.</HI> What ever enjoyments you had, pedigree, e&s;tate, honou|rable offices; upon this account you would call your &s;elf happy, that you were conver|ed.

<P>GODLINESS is a thing of great concernment. The acceptance of &s;er|vices, the hearing of prayers, and the &s;alvation of the &s;oul doth depend upon it.

Many times godly men have &s;cruples, and &s;ometimes great fears, that they are not godly: They often &s;et in judgment on them&s;elves, and are at a lo&s;s what &s;entence to pronounce. And &s;ome ungodly men have great hopes that they are in a good e&s;tate, and &s;teal comfort that do not belong to them. Some cannot &s;ee their way to condemn them&s;elves, and &s;ome give judgment for them&s;elves. But the Apo|&s;tle doth here direct the one &s;ort and the other in the determination of their condition. Fir&s;t, he tells us how a godly man may know his godline&s;s: He that &s;ees the workings of the grace of love in him&s;elf; he that &s;ees more or fewer actings of that grace, may conclude for him&s;elf, that he is born of God, hath had a work of regeneration, the go&s;pel has had a &s;aving efficacy on his heart, he has the &s;pirit|ual knowledge of God, his eyes have been opened to &s;ee the glory of God. Secondly, he tells us how hypocrites may know their hypocri&s;y: He that loveth not, that liveth in the omi&s;&s;ion of love, that hath nothing of the working of that &s;pirit, that lives in the neglect of it, hath not the &s;piritual knowledge of God; whatever pretences he makes, this ca&s;ts the ca&s;e again&s;t him. The like we may &s;ay with re|&s;pect to every other grace: He that believeth on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that loveth God, that has god|ly &s;orrow, is born of God: But he that doth not believe in Chri&s;t, that loveth not God, that hath not godly &s;orrow, knoweth not God, whatever profe&s;&s;ions he maketh</P>

<P N="3">3. An <HI>act of gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion</HI> is no evidence.

If a man's nature be much weakned, yet in a fit he may act very &s;trongly: So, if men's corruptions be much weakened, yet they may have fits wherein they may act very powerfully.

If Men live in a way of Di&s;o|bedience they do not <HI>love</HI> God; for love will make men keep God's commands. 1 Joh. 5.3 <HI>Herein is love, that we keep his commands, and his commands are not grievous.</HI> If men live in a way of Di&s;obedience they have not a &s;pirit of <HI>Faith;</HI> for faith &s;anctifies men: Acts 16.68. <HI>Sanctifyed by faith that is in me.</HI> If men live in a way of di&s;obedience they are not Chri&s;t's &s;heep; for <HI>his &s;heep hear his voice,</HI> Joh. 10.27.

<P N="1">1. A cour&s;e of <HI>external &s;in</HI> is an evidence of Hypocri&s;y, whether it be a &s;in of omi&s;&s;ion or commi&s;&s;ion. If men live in the neglect of known duties, or in the practice of known e|vils, that will be their condemnation. Let the &s;in be what it will; let it be Prophane&s;s, Drunkenne&s;s, Uncleanne&s;s, Lying, or Inju&s;|tice. Thus it was with the Sons of <HI>Eli, Hophni</HI> and <HI>Phineas,</HI> they are called <HI>&s;ons of Be|lial, that knew not the Lord,</HI> 1 Sam. 2.12. The foundation of their cen&s;ure was their profane&s;s and uncleanne&s;s, <HI>v.</HI> 13.14, 22. So it was with <HI>Jehu,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his zeal in de&s;troying <HI>Baal,</HI> becau&s;e he practiced and tolerated the wor&s;hip of the <HI>Calves</HI> at <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Bethel,</HI> 2 King 10 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of I&s;rael, with all his heart and with all his &s;oul; for he turned a&s;ide after the &s;in of Jeroboam.</HI> So many of the Phari&s;ees were wicked, becau&s;e they devoured widows hou&s;es, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.14. Thus <HI>Judas</HI> appeared to be an hypocrite, becau&s;e he lived in theft, Joh. 12.6. <HI>He was a thief</HI> That &s;hewed the rotten|ne&s;s of the heart of <HI>Demas,</HI> that he was an a|po&s;tate, 2 Tim. 4.10. <HI>Demas hath for&s;aken me, having loved this pre&s;ent evil world.</HI> To live impenitently in any outward known &s;in, will ca&s;t again&s;t a man, and prove him an hypocrite.</P>
<P N="2">2 A cour&s;e of <HI>internal &s;in</HI> proves a man to be an hypocrite. Though he wa&s;hes his hands, if he does not clean&s;e his heart, he is ungod|ly. The external conver&s;ation of &s;ome hypo|crites

may excell the conver&s;ation of &s;ome &s;aints; but if there be a way of internal &s;in, their preten&s;es to godline&s;s are vain. There be two &s;orts of internal &s;ins, which men may live in a way of, and is a witne&s;s again&s;t them. One is, a way of corrupt thoughts and af|fections: If men allow them&s;elves in malice, envy, wanton thoughts, prophane thoughts, that will condemn them.</P>
<P>Though tho&s;e corruptions do not break out in any &s;candalous way, tho&s;e thoughts are an evidence of a rotten heart Tit. 3.3. <HI>We our &s;elves were &s;ometimes fooli&s;h, di&s;obedient, de|ceived, &s;erving divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures, living in malice and enemy, hateful and hating one ano|ther.</HI> If a man allows him&s;elf, though he thinks he doth not, in malice or envy, he is an hypocrite; though his con&s;cience di&s;allows it, yet if his heart allows it he is no &s;aint; if be does not hate and mortify tho&s;e corrupt af|fections, he is no &s;aint. The other way of li|ving in internal &s;in is, to live in the omi&s;&s;ion of &s;piritual duties: Whether a man knows it or knows it not, it is an evidence of hypocri&s;y. Many men that make a fair &s;hew, do not be|lieve in Je&s;us Chri&s;t: They have a per&s;wa&s;ion of the truth of the go&s;pel, they hope Chri&s;t will &s;ave them, they have had &s;ome joy in hea|ting the go&s;pel, but they do not believe in Chri&s;t; either they are carnally confident, or di&s;couraged: This doth condemn them. <HI>He that believeth not, the wrath of God abideth on him,</HI> Joh. 3.36. He that is contentious and
<PB N="115" REF="011873_0118_0F8741172E880878">
obeys not the go&s;pel, will be condemned, Rom. 2.8. So, if a man live in the neglect of love to God; if there be no hearty love to God in his profe&s;&s;ion, in his obedience, he is not godly: Though there be affection, yet if there be not hearty love, that will condemn him: That was the condemnation of the Jews, Joh. 5.42. <HI>I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.</HI> If men be zealous men, have tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience, delight in &s;ab|baths, but are de&s;titute of love to God, they are hypocrites. So, if there be not a &s;pirit of love to &s;aints, 1 Cor. 13.23. <HI>If I &s;peak with the tongue of men and angels, and have not charity, I am become as &s;ounding bra&s;s, and a tinkling cym|bal</HI> So, 1 Joh. 4.8. <HI>He that loveth not, knoweth not God.</HI></P>

<P>Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Saints may certainly &s;ee particular acts of Grace.</HI> Though there be many acts of grace that a man doth not know to be &s;uch, yet &s;ome acts of grace are plain to be &s;een. We find Chri&s;t enquiring of one whether he did believe, Joh. 9.35. <HI>Do&s;t thou believe on the Son of God?</HI> and of another whether he loved him, Joh. 21.16. <HI>Simon &s;on of Jonas, love&s;t thou me?</HI> That &s;hews that &s;uch things may be known, el&s;e to what purpo&s;e would it be to a&s;k tho&s;e que&s;tions. And rea&s;on &s;hews that they may be &s;een, for they do greatly differ from all counterfeit acts, and &s;ometimes grace acts very &s;trongly and apparently. And we have an account in Scripture of &s;aints that have &s;poken very confidently about the work|ings of a &s;pirit of grace; &s;o <HI>Job,</HI> Job 42.5, 6. <HI>Now mine eye &s;eeth thee, wherefore I abhor my&s;elf in du&s;t and a&s;hes.</HI> He &s;aw the mighty workings of a &s;pirit of repentance, and was at no lo&s;s about it. So <HI>David,</HI> P&s;al. 116.1. <HI>I love the Lord.</HI> He &s;peaks of it as of a thing he was a&s;&s;ured of. The like workings of heart he found towards the law, P&s;al, 119.97. <HI>O how love I thy law.</HI> So, <HI>Peter</HI> appears
<PB N="117" REF="011873_0120_0F8741191F67CB80">
to Chri&s;t, who knew his heart, Joh. 21.17. <HI>Lord, thou knowe&s;t all things, thou knowe&s;t that I love thee.</HI> And others have had the like ex|perience.</P>
<P N="2">2 Ordinarily, they do certainly &s;ee but <HI>few particular acts of grace.</HI> There is a very great difference in godly men upon this account. I take it for granted, that there are not two men in ten thou&s;and, that have ju&s;t the &s;ame experience. More generally, godly men do hope and think, that they exerci&s;e grace many times every day, in their prayers, and in their callings, and in their conver&s;ation with men; but it is but now and then that they can cer|tainly &s;peak up to it. There he great mix|tures of corruption with grace, there be many fal&s;e appearances of grace, which makes them afraid whether they did indeed exerci&s;e grace; and this makes it evident, that it is thus with Saints, that many of them are for a long time under doubt whether they be indeed godly; thence we have the&s;e precepts, 2 Pet. 1.10. <HI>Give all diligence to make your calling and election &s;ure.</HI> 2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Examine your&s;elves, whether you be in the Faith.</HI> Some hypocrites are a great deal more confident than many &s;aints. Many godly men are at a lo&s;s whether their faith be any other than what unconverted men may have. And &s;o about their other graces; there be &s;ome &s;aints that have a&s;&s;urance, but the foundation of it is, that now and then they &s;ee the plain actings of faith and love, and re|pentance.
<PB N="118" REF="011873_0121_0F874119EF0DF1B8">
They &s;ee &s;omething of encourage|ment from their daily walk. But that which begets a&s;&s;urance is, that &s;ometimes they plain|ly &s;ee Grace.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the&s;e vi&s;ible actings of grace, <HI>they may conclude there is a cour&s;e of gracious carriages.</HI> Godly men are de&s;cribed to be men that walk in a cour&s;e of holine&s;s. P&s;al. 119.1. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the undefiled in the way, that walk in the law of the Lord.</HI> And we find that godly men have been well &s;atisfied that they have walked in a way of holine&s;s. I&s;ai. 39.3. <HI>Re|member, O Lord, I be&s;eech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy &s;ight.</HI> If it be enquired, how they do know that their obedience is not the fruit of natural con|&s;cience and common grace, as it is with many others; The An&s;wer is, that they &s;ee now and then the plain exerci&s;es of grace, and from thence conclude, that they are under the in|fluence of a gracious &s;pirit in their walk; that though they be guilty of much formality and hypocri&s;y, yet there is a &s;pirit of holine&s;s working in them, and an hearty care to keep the commandments of God. If a man &s;ees now and then a &s;pirit of love to God, he may &s;afely conclude that his religion is not the fruit of o&s;tentation, or &s;lavi&s;h fear, but that a graci|ous &s;pirit doth &s;tir him up to perform his duty, and that his walk his holy.</P>

others, but which is a great deal wor&s;e, they de|ceive them&s;elves al&s;o. But this will condemn them, that they live in a cour&s;e of &s;in; and &s;uch mu&s;t go with ungodly men: P&s;al. 125, 5. <HI>As for &s;uch as turn a&s;ide unto their crooked ways, the Lord will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity.</HI> If there be a great change in a man's Carriage, and he be reformed in &s;everal particulars, yet if there be one evil way, the man is an ungodly man. If he doth choice &s;ervice for the church of God, yet he is an un|godly man. If there are twenty hopeful things that may be alledged for him, yet he will not pa&s;s for a godly man. Where their is piety, there is univer&s;al obedience. A man may have great infirmities, yet be a godly man; &s;o it was with <HI>Lot</HI> and <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Peter;</HI> but if he lives in a way of &s;in, he does not render his godline&s;s only &s;u&s;picious, but it is full evidence again&s;t him. Men that are godly, have a re|&s;pect to all God's commandments, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.1. There be a great many commands, and if there be one of them that a man has not a re|&s;pect unto, he will be put to &s;hame another day. If a man lives in one evil way, he is not &s;ubject to God's authority; but then he lives in rebellion, and that will take off all his pleas, and at once cut off all his pretences, and he will be condemned in the day of Judgment; Luk. 13 27. <HI>Depart from me, all ye that work iniquity.</HI> One way of &s;in is exception enough again&s;t the man's &s;alvation.</P>

&s;uch per&s;ons will not be guilty of perjury, &s;tealing, drunkene&s;s, fornication; they look upon them to be heinous things, and they are afraid of them, but they do not much matter it if they oppre&s;s a little in a bargain, if they commend a thing too much which they are about to &s;ell, if they break a promi&s;e, if they &s;pend the &s;abbath unprofitably, if they neglect &s;ecret prayer, if they talk rudely, and reproach others; they think the&s;e things are but &s;mall things: If they can keep clear of great tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, they hope that God will not in&s;i&s;t upon &s;mall things; but indeed all the com|mands of God are e&s;tabli&s;hed by divine autho|rity, and that man that doth not lay weight upon little commands, keeps none as he ought to do.

Little &s;ins are of a damning nature as well as great; if they do not de&s;erve &s;o much puni&s;hment as greater, yet they do de&s;erve damnation.

but will not allow him&s;elf to break it, he is in a peri&s;hing condition.</P>
<P N="2">2 Though their temptations be great. Some Per&s;ons delight in iniquity, they take plea&s;ure in rudene&s;s, and intemperate practices: But there be others that do not delight in &s;in; they can hand&s;omely avoid it, they do not chu&s;e it: Except they be under &s;ome great nece&s;&s;ity they will not do it: They are afraid to &s;in, they think it is dangerous, and have &s;ome care to avoid it. But &s;ometimes they force them&s;elves to &s;in: They are reduced to difficulties, and cannot tell how well to avoid it. It is a dangerous thing not to do it.

So the &s;tony ground hearers were willing to retain the profe&s;&s;ion of the true religion, but the ca&s;e was &s;uch that they thought they could not well do it; Mat 13.21. <HI>When tribulation or per&s;ecution ari&s;eth becau&s;e of the word, by and by he is offended.</HI> They would have cho&s;e to have lived and died in the profe&s;&s;ion of the truth, but they cannot brook confi&s;cation, and pri|&s;ons, and death; and &s;o they mu&s;t be excu&s;ed if they drop their profe&s;&s;ion.

If a man be willing to &s;erve God in ordinary ca&s;es, but excu&s;e him&s;elf when there be great difficulties, he is not godly.

You may have &s;cru|ples upon many account: You may be under difficulties becau&s;e God hides his face at pre&s;ent from you: You may have temptation from &s;in|gular afflictions, and becau&s;e God denies to an|&s;wer &s;ome prayers, in things that lie much upon your hearts: You may have difficulties from &s;uch workings of corruption as &s;eems to be incon|&s;i&s;tent with Grace: You may have temptation becau&s;e you do not &s;eem to grow; but if you have certainly &s;een the working of a gracious &s;pirit, if an hundred times, if ten times, if one time, you may conclude that you are godly. That which was not in being could not be &s;een that which is not, is invi&s;ible. If there were no &s;un, or moon, or &s;tars, none could be &s;een: So, if there were no faith, or love, they could not be &s;een. There may be grace where it is not &s;een, but where it is &s;een, there it is; and you may conclude that you are godly. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. This &s;hews that there was at the time a principle of grace. The habits of grace are not immediately to be &s;een, but only by their workings. If there be a gracious act, there
<PB N="125" REF="011873_0128_0F8741226F9EFAA0">
mu&s;t be a gracious principle; if there be not an antecedent one, there mu&s;t be at lea&s;t a concomitant one; for while a man remains in his natural condition, he cannot act graci|ou&s;ly; Rom. 8.7. <HI>The natural mind is enmity to God, and is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</HI> If a man loves God, he is di&s;|po&s;ed to love him; if he believes in Chri&s;t, he is di&s;po&s;ed to believe in Chri&s;t. It is impo&s;&s;i|ble to do tho&s;e actions without a di&s;po&s;ition to them; and that di&s;po&s;ition is a principle or ha|bit of grace. Every man that acts graciou&s;ly is a new creature: Until the heart be chang|ed, it will not carry graciou&s;ly. Any act of grace is a &s;ure token of regeneration: If a man believes in Chri&s;t, he is certainly born of God; Joh. 1.12, 13. <HI>To them that received him gave he power to become the &s;ons of God, even to them that believe on his name, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God.</HI> If a man breaths, and &s;ees, and hears, and walks, he is certainly a living man. Where there is an act of life, there is a principle of life; 1 Joh. 37. <HI>He that doth righteou&s;ne&s;s is righteous, as he is righteous.</HI> Every effect mu&s;t have a proper cau&s;e. If the heart were utterly oppo&s;ite to believing, lo|ving or repenting, he would not believe, love or repeat. The heart of a man is always in|clined to what he chu&s;es. The mind may un|der&s;tand a thing that he is not inclined to un|der&s;tand; but the Will never chu&s;es without an inclination &s;o to do. If there be a change
<PB N="126" REF="011873_0129_0F874124234BE768">
in the behaviour of the heart, there is a change in the di&s;po&s;ition of the heart.</P>
<P N="2">2 If a principle of grace were once there, it is always there. It was otherwi&s;e under the covenant of works; <HI>Adam</HI>'s grace was per|fect but mutable; for he did not fulfil the con|dition of the covenant; if he had once done that, his grace would have been immutable. But under the new covenant, if a man be once godly, he always will be godly; for every one who is godly, has fulfilled the condition of the covenant. Grace may decay, but it never will be lo&s;t: It may wither, but never die. Com|mon grace may be lo&s;t, but &s;aving grace can|not be lo&s;t: If grace be once begun it will continue; Phil. 6. <HI>I am confident of this very thing, that he that hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it to the day of Chri&s;t.</HI> The power of God is engaged for the pre&s;ervation of grace. Once godly and always godly; 1 Pet. 1.5. <HI>Who are kept by the power of God, through faith unto &s;alvation.</HI> Sometimes they are afraid they &s;hall fall away, but whether they have more &s;trength or le&s;s &s;trength, they &s;hall never fall away; God's covenant is their &s;ecurity. Such men may have great temptations; Hereticks may endeavour to &s;educe them, vicious men may &s;eek to debauch them, worldly men may entice them, per&s;ecutors may &s;eek to fright them out of their religion; but nothing can be too hard for them: <HI>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it,</HI> Cant. 8.7. They may have temptation to pride, to pre|&s;umption,
<PB N="127" REF="011873_0130_0F8741257A0D7EF8">
to di&s;couragement; but if they be led into temptation, they will be delivered from evil. A principle of grace is like a liv|ing fountain; Joh. 4.14. <HI>Who&s;oever drinketh of the water that I &s;hall give him. &s;hall never thir&s;t; but the water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hallbe in him a well of water &s;pringing up into everla&s;ting life.</HI> Fal&s;e hearted men may fall away, but tho&s;e that are &s;incere will be more than Conquerors. If <HI>Abraham</HI> be once godly, he will continue &s;o, though he lives an hundred and &s;eventy years. If grace be begun here, it will be perfected in heaven.</P>
<P>USE 3 Of direction to godly men, how you may know your &s;incerity; <HI>viz.</HI> by renewing the vi&s;ible actings of grace. Many &s;igns are given of holine&s;s, that will not bear examina|tion; and there is danger that many are de|ceived thereby. Some godly, and &s;ome un|godly men that find them in them&s;evles may be comforted thereby, but they beget no a&s;&s;u|rance: And &s;ome men that find them in them|&s;elves, remain at a lo&s;s whether they be godly or no. The way to know your godline&s;s, is to renew the vi&s;ible exerci&s;es of grace. When a man &s;ees that he loves God, and believes in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he will not be un&s;atisfied about his godline&s;s. If he has been in the dark, and in great temptations ju&s;t before, yet this will beget a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>Here you may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1 If you do not know that you live in &s;in, that can be no evidence of your godline&s;s: As you cannot condemn your &s;elves, &s;o you can|not
<PB N="128" REF="011873_0131_0F874125DE51E2F8">
ju&s;tify your &s;elves. Some per&s;ons examine them&s;elves whether they live in any known &s;in; and upon the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry they do not find that they do. They do not find that they live in the neglect of any duty, or in the com|mi&s;&s;ion of any &s;in. Their hearts do not re|proach them: They duly attend prayer, they are careful to &s;anctify the Sabbath, they live &s;oberly, cha&s;tly, ju&s;tly, they are true to their word, and faithful in their places, they do not know upon the mo&s;t narrow &s;earch that they live in any way of &s;in, yet they cannot ju&s;tify them&s;elves from hence; 1 Cor. 4.4. <HI>I know nothing by my &s;elf, yet am I not hereby ju&s;tified:</HI> For men that examines them&s;elves may be ig|norant that they live in a way of &s;in, yet they may live in a way of &s;in; men's under&s;tandings are corrupted, and they may live in pride, worldline&s;s and unbelief, and not know it: They may think tho&s;e corruptions do not reign when indeed they do reign. Many men that do not know that they live in &s;in, are fain to &s;u&s;pend their judgment about them&s;elves; they hope from hence that they are holy, but do not know it. Though men do not know that they live in &s;in, yet God may know that they do: Prov. 30.12. <HI>There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes, yet are not clean&s;ed from their filthine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 If there be great probability that you live in a way of faith, and love, and repentance, that do not make it evident. There is &s;ome probability of &s;ome mens faith, becau&s;e go&s;pel promi&s;es have been a comfort to them; and of
<PB N="129" REF="011873_0132_0F8741269D9FD8D8">
their love, becau&s;e they are zealous and do delight in ordinances, and in prai&s;ing God; of their repentance, for their &s;ins are a great burden to them, and they are careful to avoid &s;in: but probabilities prove nothing; that may be probable, that may be fal&s;e; there may be &s;ome probability of a thing, yet the contrary may be certain. Probabilities leave men under uncertainties. If they rai&s;e hopes, yet they leave room for fears. There may be probabilities one way, and as great probabilities the other way. Men will not content them&s;elves with a probable title to their land. God will not take men to heaven becau&s;e there is a proba|bility of their goodne&s;s. Twenty Probabilities make the thing more probable, but they do not make it certain. Probabilites are no Demon&s;tration. The hopes that are built on them may be di&s;appointed, therefore we are directed to <HI>make our Calling and Election &s;ure.</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10.</P>
<P N="3">3. All the vi&s;ible exerci&s;es of grace are evidential. The word of God tells that all that believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t are Chrildren of God, Joh, 1.12. <HI>To them that received him, gave he power to become the Sons of God.</HI> It tells that all that love God are heirs of heaven. Jam. 1.12. <HI>God has promi&s;ed a Crown of life, to them that love him.</HI> So it tells us that all that have godly Sorrow &s;hall be &s;aved. 2 Cor. 7.10. <HI>Godly &s;orrow worketh repentance unto Salvation.</HI> And that all that love the brethren &s;hall have eternal life, 1 Joh. 3.24. <HI>We know that we are tran&s;lated from death to life, be|cau&s;e we love the brethren.</HI> Hence if any of the&s;e workings be clearly &s;een, the man has a &s;ure evidence of his good e&s;tate: He has ground to ca&s;t the ca&s;e for him&s;elf: It is no pre&s;umption for him to conclude his
<PB N="130" REF="011873_0133_0F87412767384880">
Ju&s;tification: He has a divine warrant to give &s;entence for him&s;elf: At &s;uch a time when he pronounces him|&s;elf a &s;aint, he goes according to law and evidence: His confidence is a&s;&s;urance: For tho&s;e exerci&s;es of grace that he is con&s;cious to are peculiar to godly men, and do a&s;&s;uredly di&s;tingui&s;h them from all other men.</P>
<P N="4">4. The more the&s;e vi&s;ible exerci&s;es of grace are re|newed, the more certain you will be: the more fre|quently the&s;e actings are renewed, the more abiding and confirmed your a&s;&s;urance will be. A man that has been a&s;&s;ured of &s;uch vi&s;ible exerci&s;es of grace may quickly after be in doubt whether he was not mi&s;taken; but when &s;uch actings are renewed again and again, he grows more &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed about his good e&s;tate. If a man &s;ee a thing once, that makes him &s;ure; but if afterwards he fear he was deceived, when he comes to &s;ee it again, he is more &s;ure he is not mi&s;taken. If a man read &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages in a Book, he is &s;ure it is &s;o; &s;ome months after &s;ome may bear him down, that he was mi&s;taken, &s;o as to make him que&s;tion it him&s;elf; but when he looks and reads it again, he is abundantly confirmed. The more mens grace is multiplied, the more their peace is multiplied. 2 Pet. 1.2, <HI>Grace and Peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Je&s;us our Lord.</HI> The third time the que&s;tion was put to Peter whether he loved Chri&s;t, he an&s;wers with greater a&s;&s;urance; the very propo&s;ing of the que&s;t|ion &s;tirred up the working of a &s;pirit of love, and he &s;peaks with very great confidence, <HI>Job.</HI> 21.15, 16, 17. The fir&s;t and &s;econd time he &s;ays, <HI>Yea, Lord, thou know|e&s;t that I love thee:</HI> But the third time he &s;peaks with greate&s;t a&s;&s;urance, <HI>Lord thou knowe&s;t all things, thou knowe&s;t that I love thee.</HI> It went greatly to his heart that his love &s;hould be &s;o often que&s;tioned, and &s;o he was more abundantly &s;atisfied in the truth of his love.</P>
