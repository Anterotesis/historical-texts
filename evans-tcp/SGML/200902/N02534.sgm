<HEAD>Regular Singing THE ONLY True Way of Singing.</HEAD>
<P>MAN being &s;o uncapable of di&s;cerning how to Wor&s;hip God, in a manner becom|ing his Excellency; It is truly a great favour of God to Man, to give him needful Directions about his Wor&s;hip. It is gene|rally held, That God has done &s;o; and therefore, Man is under no nece&s;&s;ity of act|ing without a Rule, or of following the Tra|ditions of Men, for want of a Divine Rule.</P>
<P>GOD's Command is Perfect, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19.7. and &s;erving thorowly to furni&s;h the Man of God <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> every good Work. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.17. And if it has plea&s;ed God in any way or manner to declare his Mind about his Wor&s;hip, there is an Obligation lying on Man, to ob|&s;erve and follow the&s;e Directions: And that in one thing, as well as another. But this is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> great Unhappine&s;s of Man, that his
<PB N="2" REF="003006_0004_0FEF9BA957B71738">Heart does not &s;tand alike di&s;po&s;ed toward every part of the Mind of God. Altho' there be &s;omethings that he can readily re|ceive and comply with, yet there be &s;ome other parts of God's Mind, that he is aver&s;e unto. Men are loach to own, that their re|fu&s;ing to comply with this, or that, is from a Di&s;like or Di&s;affection unto Truth, There is an endeavour to put a fair face, or pre|tence on the matter, as that, they are not convinced it is the Mind of God, but &s;ome Invention of Man. But many times there is a real Di&s;like and Di&s;affection, towards that part of Gods Will. And this Di&s;like ari&s;es from &s;undry things,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Cu&s;tom,</HI> the power of which, is many times very great. If Per&s;ons have been for many Years accu&s;tomed to that for which they have no Warrant, it comes at length, to have as much power over them as a Law. Its a very difficult thing to bring per&s;ons off from what they have been long u&s;ed to; and to bring them to take directions from the Word of God. There is commonly in &s;uch Ca&s;es a Super&s;titious fear, wherewith the Minds of Per&s;ons are Exercis'd and Teaz'd. They dare not leave what they have been u&s;ed to, le&s;t they &s;hould Sin. They dare not admit of any alteration from what they have been u&s;ed unto, for fear of &s;ome lad
<PB N="3" REF="003006_0004_0FEF9BA957B71738">Con&s;equents. And hence may we ob&s;erve (many times) that men of hone&s;t Princi|ples, and it may be of mo&s;t Zeal in Religion, prove the Greate&s;t oppo&s;ers of Reforming what is ami&s;s in Religion, or the Wor&s;hip of God, let there be never &s;o good &amp; weigh|ty rea&s;ons for it. And thus we &s;ee, how a great defect in Obedience any, thro' a mi&s;|taken mind, ari&s;e from a good Principle, that is fear of doing ami&s;s. Many for fear of doing ami&s;s, Do ami&s;s, or neglect and re|fu&s;e to do well.</P>
<P N="2">2. Many times Per&s;ons are much Swayed and Influenced in this matter, <HI>From the Judgment and Practice</HI> of &s;uch as they have a great e&s;teem of, for Knowledge, Wi&s;dom &amp; Piety. It is a very un&s;afe thing to rely wholly on the Judgment or Practice of any, in matters of Religion; but yet it many times is thus. The Judgment of men that are highly accounted of, Sways more with &s;ome, than the &s;tronge&s;t and cleare&s;t Argu|ments in the World. There are, that ei|ther have no great capacity of trying and weighing things, or have not accu&s;tomed them&s;elves thereto; but they rely on the Judgment of &s;uch as they have a great e|&s;teem of; and hence, are entirely comply|ing with them. Let the&s;e they admire be for or again&s;t the Truth, they be &s;o too Joh.

<P N="3">3. Mens di&s;like unto any part of the mind of God ari&s;es many times from their pa&s;&s;ing a Judgment on things <HI>by Fal&s;e Rules.</HI> There is no po&s;&s;ibility of proving, Truth to be Er|ror; or of proving Error to be Truth; how|ever tho&s;e things may attend or follow one or the other, from whence, Per&s;ons that have a Bya&s;s or their minds will take occa|&s;ion to argoe ami&s;s. Thus.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons will &s;ometimes argue for the thing they hold and practice, that it right and good, from the good tendency of it, or from &s;ome good fruits and effects. And &s;o on the other hand, its a common thing for Per|&s;ons to argue and plead again&s;t the Truth, from &s;ome ill things that attend, or follow it. Thus Per&s;ons may Argue again&s;t the Do|ctrine of the Go&s;pel, becau&s;e it cau&s;es Con|tention. Its no &s;olid Argument again&s;t the Truth and Goodne&s;s of a thing, that in &s;ometimes proves &s;o. That which in its own nature tends to Union, Love Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may by Accident prove a cau&s;e to the Contrary. Rom. 7.7. <HI>What &s;hall we &s;ay then, is the Law Sin? God Forbid.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Mens di&s;like unto any particular Branch of God's mind, does very often a|ri&s;e <HI>from Corrupt Affections</HI> and <HI>Vicious Inclina|tions.</HI> The nature of Man abounds with
<PB N="5" REF="003006_0005_0FEF9BAC05246BE8">the&s;e, and hence when any Precept of Re|ligion is declared and urged, that is con|trary unto the&s;e Sinful inclinations, they di&s;po&s;e a man to reject the &s;ame. And this is the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> a time; when Con&s;cience is pleaded and pretended, corrupt Affection, or evil Inclination is at the Bottom, and does cau&s;e this di&s;like and rejection of the Truth As,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Sometimes Sloch Men love an ea&s;y &amp; a cheap way of &s;erving GOD, and when any thing is moved, and urged from the Word that reguires &s;ome Labour and Pains taking, beyond what they have been u&s;ed to, their Slothful inclination dispo&s;es them to reject it, and oppo&s;e it. There is &s;ome Labour in the ca&s;e, and that they Decline and Reject. <HI>Prod</HI> 15 19.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Sometimes Covetou&s;ne&s;s moves Men to hate and reject a Duty moved &amp; urged. Thus when work of Charity and of Merry are urged, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, cau&s;es a di&s;like, as Luke 16 14. <HI>And the Phari&s;ees al&s;o, who were Covetous, heard all the&s;e things and they Derided him.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3 But very often Pride is the great op|po&s;er of Truth It is no Di&s;honour to the wi&s;e&s;t &amp; greate&s;t of men to yield to Truth; but really a very commendable thing, and for a mans Honour, but many times men
<PB N="6" REF="003006_0006_0FEF9BAEB3B5A3F0">have this tho't, that the owning and re|ceiving of &s;uch a Truth, will touch their Re|putation, and turn to their Di&s;credit. Its ask &s;ome to them, to own, they have been in an Erro: It may be, they have &s;poken and done much again&s;t the Truth; and now the Temptation is &s;trong, to &s;tand to what they have &s;aid <HI>Prov.</HI> 15.10.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>By rea&s;on of Pride it hurts the Man that tho&s;e he hath oppo&s;ed about the matter, &s;hould get the Victory; and therefore he is pu&s;hed forward by this Luft, that he may have the Victory.</P>
<P>Sometimes Per&s;ons are moved to reject a thing urged, as a Duty, from a Spirit of Co|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ahi&s;m, or a forward di&s;po&s;ition to oppo&s;e Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Sometimes becau&s;e they have not been Advi&s;ed with, and Con&s;ulted in the ca&s;e, or about the matter to be advanced, they are &s;o far from Complying, that they will oppo&s;e; Ina&s;much as their Con&s;ent was not asked, they will not fail to enter their Di&s;&s;ent. It may be, Reader, thou growe&s;t angry at the Reading of the&s;e things, and it &s;o, thou art the man, I need no more Evidence, that thou art Guilty.</P>
<P>Well, let it be from the cau&s;es mentioned, or from any other Springs, its a great Sin, and a great Unhappine&s;s, for a man to have
<PB N="7" REF="003006_0006_0FEF9BAEB3B5A3F0">&s;uch a di&s;like or di&s;affection unto any part of the Mind and Will of GOD, as to reject it on that account.</P>
<P N="1">1. In this a man deny's GOD's Sove|reignty over him, Return again&s;t him, Pre|fers him&s;elf unto GOD, and does indeed make him&s;elf both the Rule and End in that Wor&s;hip that he will not have guided by GOD's Will, but by his own. <HI>Zec.</HI> 7.8. <HI>When ye Fa&s;ted, did ye Fa&s;t at all unto me?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It is directly contrary unto the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion that men do commonly and freely make, <HI>viz.</HI> That they are very ready and willing to be guided and governed by the Will of GOD, if they did but know it. Now for any that make this free profe&s;&s;ion, to reject a Branch of GOD's Mind, becau&s;e it is di&s;agreeing with their corrupt inelina|tions is a contradiction to their Profe&s;&s;ion. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.16. <HI>In Works they deny him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In ca&s;e the thing that men reject and oppo&s;e (through di&s;affection) comes to them with &s;ufficient proof and evidence, its a violation of the order, that GOD has &s;et, and e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Soul of Man. There is a certain Order or Law e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Soul of Man, and that is, when the eviden|ces for a thing, do plainly out-weigh, all the Objections that can be made again&s;t the &s;ame, to yield an a&s;&s;ent unto the Truth of
<PB N="8" REF="003006_0007_0FEF9BB2E1532890">it; and in ca&s;e he do otherwi&s;e, he offers violence unto his own mind. And this is a matter to be &s;erio&s;ly thought on by Men that make nothing of rejecting what does not &s;uit their Humour or Corrupt inclina|tion, tho' it be never &s;o well Proved and Evidenced. As tho' it were a matter in their Power to receive or reject as they plea&s;e. But indeed to reject a Truth duely evidenced is a great Sin <HI>Jer</HI> 8 9 <HI>Do they have rejected the Word of the Lord.</HI> And the,</P>
<P N="4">4 This Di&s;like or Di&s;affection unto Truth does many times render Per&s;ons very Unrea&s;onable and Unmanly. It is certain|ly a Duty for Rea&s;onable Creatures to act as Rea&s;onable Creatures. I &s;a 46 8. <HI>Shew your &s;elves men</HI> But Per&s;ons from a Di&s;like and Di&s;affection unto Truth, are many times moved to act <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> becoming Men, and much more unbecoming Chri&s;tians As,

<ITEM><PB N="9" REF="003006_0007_0FEF9BB2E1532890">
(3) Many times it fills men with &s;uch Rage again&s;t the Truth, that they will not bear to hear any thing about it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4) This makes men to lay great weight, on light and worth e&s;s Arguments, to de|fend what they hold; and to rai&s;e Silly, Fooli&s;h, &amp; Frivolous Objections again&s;t the Truth; and never own, or acknowledge any An&s;wer to their Objections, be it never &s;o full.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(5) This will move Men to hate and abu&s;e, &s;uch as plead for, what they di&s;like and reject. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>(6) It will move them to enter into the &s;harpo&s;t Contentions, to keep off Truth, and to hold and maintain, what they have no Warrant for. And when they have &s;et the City, and the Sanctuary of GOD on Fire, then (<HI>Nero</HI> like) lay the blame on the Innocent pleaders for Truth, that they are di&s;turbers of the Peace. The&s;e, and &s;uch like, are the unhappy fraits of mens ha|ving a di&s;affection, or prejudice, towards any part of the Mind and Will of GOD.
<P>And when we ob&s;erve under what fair pretences all this is, there is rea&s;on to &s;ay to the&s;e men, Surely, <HI>Ye know not what manner of &s;pirit ye are of,</HI> Luk. 9.55</P>
<P>An In&s;tance wherein the Truth of what has been &s;aid, may be very plainly ob&s;erved
<PB N="10" REF="003006_0008_0FEF9BB754E2E898">is about the Singing of P&s;alms. The matter of Controver&s;y about the perfor|mance of this part of Divine Wor&s;hip, is this, viz.</P>
<P><HI>Whether in Singing the Songs of the LORD, we ought to proceed by a certain Rule, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to do it in any Loo&s;e, Defective, Irregular way, that the, or that People, have Accu&s;tomed them&s;elves unto?</HI></P>
<P>Its a matter the wi&s;eft and mo&s;t able to Judge, are clear, and full in, and do a&s;&s;ert, That there is a &s;ure and certain Rule, to be u&s;ed, in Singing; and it is as clearly di&s;cer|ned, by the be&s;t of Judges; that this excel|lent Rule is left; and that there are many ill fruits and effects that follow upon the neglect of the Rule, or deviation from it.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that a multitude of Per&s;ons, live in a neglect of this Duty. Many neg|lect it in Publick, they open not their Mouths to Prai&s;e GOD. And probably many more that neglect it in their Pamilies, and becau&s;e they know not how to Sing.</P>
<P>Again, For want of knowledge and skill in Mu&s;ick, Per&s;ons cannot have that Love to, that Delight in &amp; that Reli&s;h of, the Duty, as if they were Skilled &amp; did u&s;e their Skill. This is known to be a truth by the Expe|rience
<PB N="11" REF="003006_0008_0FEF9BB754E2E898">of &s;uch as once were ignorant &amp; have afterward gotten Knowlege. And the truth of this may be &s;een in other things: The ingenious Arti&s;t has much more of plea&s;ure, in his Science or Trade, than another man that has no Skill in it.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>(7) The Rule being neglected as u&s;ele&s;s, the Performance is very mean, compared with what it would be, were the Procedure by a Rule. It is as flat Drink, compared with that which is lively, brisk and full of Spirit: And the E&s;teem of it is much &s;unk, and a carele&s;s &s;pirit prevailing about the Performance. And as it has been an unhap|pine&s;s attending our defective, loo&s;e way of doing, that we have been under di&s;advan|tages either to di&s;cover our Defectivene&s;s, or to Reform it; &s;o now, tho' we are delivered from that, as great, if not a wor&s;e evil is met with; and that is, that having been long accu&s;tomed to a Loo&s;e, Irregular way, we are now, grown into love with it, and are &s;o far from any willingne&s;s, to Reform, that we cannot bear to have any fault found with our doings in this part of Divine Wor&s;hip. Many are found &s;o under the influence and power of Cu&s;tom, that they account the common performance to be better, than any Reformation can make it; and are therefore, &s;o far, from hearkning to any propo&s;als for
<PB N="12" REF="003006_0009_0FEF9BB9115FFF80">a Reformation, that the Propo&s;al meets with not only Rejection, but very fierce Oppo&s;i|tion, and abundance of Cen&s;ure and Re|flection: And &s;ome, are ready to Lavi&s;h a|way as much Zeal, as tho' there were an attempt, to pluck away a Fundamental Ar|ticle in Religion, or to bring in one of the greate&s;t Here&s;y's or de&s;tructive Corrupti|ons into the Church. The Ob&s;ervation of this, is matter of di&s;couragement to at|tempt to do any &s;ervice to Religion as to this Affair. However, there are &s;ome Con|&s;iderations that may, notwith&s;tanding move a man to adventure.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. It is not only the mo&s;t Rational way of treating our fellow Creatures to offer plain Arguments for their Conviction, but its a thing that is really owing, and due unto them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Its an Honour due to Truth. Indeed our Zeal is to be wi&s;ely and duely propor|tioned. Our greate&s;t Zeal &s;hould be about the weightie&s;t points in Religion, but &s;maller things are not to be neglected: But ju&s;t &s;o much Zeal is to be proportioned out unto them as is due. Mat. 23 23. <HI>The&s;e things ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Such an attempt may do &s;ome good, and it may be more than is feared. But,</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="13" REF="003006_0009_0FEF9BB9115FFF80">
4. In ca&s;e Per&s;ons will continue to Re|ject the Truth, after that it has been &s;uffi|ciently Evidenced &amp; Proved, and their Ob|jections An&s;wered, it will make a full di&s;co|very of the&s;e Per&s;ons, and of the cau&s;e of their continuing to reject and oppo&s;e the Truth: Mens fair pretences, will not hide them in &s;o plain a ca&s;e.</P>
<P>And this will leave &s;uch Per&s;ons without excu&s;e. Joh. 15.22. <HI>If I had not come and &s;poken unto them, they had not had Sin: But now they have no Cloak</HI> &mdash;. And this will roul all the blame that comes herefrom at their Door. Let them u&s;e as much &s;ubtil|ty as they have to &s;hift it off.</P>
<P>I &s;hall accordingly proceed to make &s;ome attempt for the convincing &amp; &s;atisfying of &s;uch as reject and oppo&s;e the making u&s;e of a certain Rule in Singing.

<ITEM>[1] You grant and readily profe&s;s, that you are willing to Comply with, the Mind of GOD about this matter, if you could but come to the Knowledge of it. Every one that di&s;&s;ents profe&s;&s;es this. See <HI>that there be &s;uch an heart in you.</HI></ITEM>

[2] You will &s;urely grant al&s;o, that its a very great Sin for men to Reject any Truth or part of GOD's Mind, in ca&s;e it comes with due Evidence and Proof. Its a greater Sin than men commonly imagine. And then,</ITEM>
<ITEM>[3] You will certainly grant, that &s;o much Proof and Evidence as is accounted &s;ufficient &amp; re&s;ted in, in other Ca&s;es &amp; &s;uch as are more Weighty, &s;hould be accounted &s;ufficient in this Ca&s;e.

It could not Con&s;i&s;t with the Wi&s;dom of GOD, to leave this Performance, to the Wit, Will, or Fancy's of Men: It was not likely to be done, in a manner becoming the Excellen|cy of GOD: If GOD has done &s;o, he has not done like him&s;elf; in ca&s;e he has done &s;o, his Command is not Perfect; which we know it is, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19 7.

<P>If GOD has done thus, he has done con|trary to what he always, and in all other ca&s;es has done; for he has always been &s;o full and particular in his Directions about his Wor&s;hip, that his Directions have extended to the outward order &amp; in very &s;mall things.

<P N="2">II. <HI>Its Evident there is &s;ome Certain Rule; for the Command to Sing, does Include and In|volve in it, that we u&s;e the In&s;trument, or Means, &s;uitable and proper for the doing of the Work, or Duty Commanded to be done; and it does &s;o, tho' there be no mention made of the In&s;trument, or Means in the Command.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="003006_0011_0FEF9BBFDF1DF528">
Its received without any Gain&s;aying or Di&s;puting, That Singing of P&s;alms is a Duty Commanded; its not an Inyention of Men, but of Divine In&s;titution. Now as man is under a nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing In&s;truments, or Means in doing his Work, and there are In&s;truments, or Means &s;uited to every &s;ort of Work or Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o the Command to do a thing, obliges to u&s;e the In&s;trument &s;uita|ble and proper for that Work: tho' there be no mention made of the In&s;trument, or Means in the Command.</P>
<P>Its ea&s;y to make this plain by a Multitude of In&s;tauces, that the Servant Commanded to do a Work, is by virtue of that Command, obliged to u&s;e the In&s;trument proper, and &s;uitable for the doing of that Work. It is &s;o in <HI>Writing, Mea&s;uring, Weighing, &amp;c.</HI> And he that teaches Man more than the Bea&s;ts of the Earth, and makes us Wi&s;er than the Fowls of Heaven, doth in&s;truct man to Di&s;|cretion, in this point.

<P>Now if there be an In&s;trument or Means, that is &s;uited, and appropriated to this work; then it may be Concluded, that the Command to Sing, does include that, and oblige to the u&s;e of it in performance of the Work. Now this will pre&s;ently appear. From Hence,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>In as much as there is but only One In|&s;trument or Means, that is it, or &s;uitable for the doing of this Work; and therefore its a Du|ty to u&s;e it in the doing of the Work.</HI></P>
<P>This is a matter as clear, as the Noon-Day-Light; that if I am Commanded to do any work, and there be only one In&s;tru|ment or Means, wherewith the work can be done, its my Duty to u&s;e that In&s;trument or Means. Its true, there be &s;ome Works, that may be performed by Various In&s;tru|ments; but ordinarily, to each work to be done, there is an In&s;trument or Means that is &s;uited, and appropriated to that work: And it is founded in the very nature of things: The work being of &s;uch a Nature, the Efficient mu&s;t have an In&s;trument, &s;o
<PB N="19" REF="003006_0012_0FEF9BC1A09E24B8">and &s;o, fitted and &s;uited to do that work with, and it is certain, that there are many works that have in&s;truments &s;o appropriated to that work, that the work can't be done, without that In&s;trument. It is &s;o in <HI>Reading, Cyphering, Weighing, Mea&s;uring, &amp;c.</HI> There is no Reading without the knowledge of the Letters, and of Joyning them toge|ther. No ca&s;ting accounts without Arith|metick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Each of the&s;e and a great many others, have their appropriated In&s;truments or Means. The work commanded to be done, can't be done without the proper In|&s;trument or Means. And it being &s;o, it can be no matter of doubt whether it be a Duty or not, to u&s;e that In&s;trument, &s;eeing the work coramanded can't be done without it, And now to apyly it to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, We are Commanded to Sing, and there is but one In&s;trument or Means, &s;uited to this work, wherewith the work can be done; And this is THE ART OF MUSICK. The de&s;ign of Art is, by &s;uitable means to guide the mind of Man in the management of that whereto the Art relates: Now Arts are very Numerous; to almo&s;t every Pur|po&s;e, there is an Art; which is the In&s;tru|ment or Means for the doing of that thing whereto it relates. New there is no Art or Science that teaches to Sing, but one, and
<PB N="20" REF="003006_0013_0FEF9BC6CF7BC690">that is The Art of <HI>Mu&s;ick, Logick</HI> teaches to <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> well, <HI>Navigation</HI> to <HI>Sail</HI> well, <HI>Geo|metry</HI> to <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> well; But only <HI>Mu&s;ick</HI> Teaches to <HI>Sing</HI> well. And there being no other Art or In&s;trument, to direct or &s;erve to this Work, it mu&s;t be a Duty to u&s;e it. And therefore, the Notion that &s;ome have of Various Rules, is utterly Vain; becau&s;e there is but one Art that Teaches any thing about the Work. This In&s;trument is ap|propriate to the Work, and can be done with no other. Wherefore, I rea&s;on thus, Either GOD has given us but One Rule, or Various, or None at all. As for his giving us None, that can't Con&s;i&s;t with His Wi&s;dom. As for there being Various, that can't be, becau&s;e there is but one Art that Teaches any thing about it. And therefore there is One, and but One Rule.</P>
<P>Object. <HI>But it may be, it will be Objected, That tho&s;e that Write about the Art of Mu&s;ick may Vary, and therefore it looks, as though there may be Various Rules, and a matter of Indifferen|cy, which we u&s;e.</HI></P>

No Art delivers any more, but one Body of Rules, to lead unto the end the Art aims at. And there is no other Variety, or Multiplicity of Rules, but what ari&s;es from the differing apprehen|&s;ions of Men. And this is plain and evident from the nature of each work to be done; the In&s;trument mu&s;t needs have its make and &s;hape, according to the nature of the work that is to be done by it; thus a <HI>Knife,</HI> a <HI>Key,</HI> a <HI>Pen,</HI> are fitted to the nature of the work to be done with them. And this is al&s;o further Evident from hence, In as much as no man, that writes about any Art or Science, pretends to give any more, but one Directory, or one Body of Rules leading to the end that the Art aims at: Which is a very plain proof that the Variety is not founded in the Nature of the thing, but ari&s;es from the differing thoughts of Men.</ITEM>

<P N="4">IV. <HI>I &s;hall Argue nextly, from the end and de&s;ign of GOD's be&s;towing the Gi&s;t, or Art of Mu&s;ick on Men, &amp; that is on purpo&s;e to direct men in Singing Songs of Prai&s;e unto His Name.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="003006_0014_0FEF9BC879214650">
If this be made evident, the point is &s;uf|ficiently proved.</P>
<P>All Gifts are from GOD. Every u&s;eful Art and Science among Men, is as really from GOD as Saving Grace, Jam. 1.17. <HI>He is the Father of Lights; from whom cometh down every Good and Perfect Gift.</HI></P>
<P>It is certain that no Man can receive any thing of this nature unle&s;s it be given him of GOD. And the&s;e Gifts are be&s;towed on Men to direct and enable them in an&s;wering the great End of their Being, <HI>viz.</HI> To Glo|rify GOD, and to do good in the World, to Profit withal, 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 12.7. Now as the&s;e Gifts are Various, for GOD has &s;uited the di&s;pen&s;ation of them unto the various ne|ce&s;&s;ities, duties, bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, whereto he calls Men, whether Civil or Sacred; &s;o its the Duty of Men to improve this Gift of GOD in the doing of that work, or thing whereto the Gift relates, and which the Gift enables a man to do. This is plain from Scripture, Rom. 12.6. <HI>Having then Gi&s;ts, differing</HI>&mdash;. 1 Pet. 4.10. <HI>As every one has received the Gift, even &s;o Mini&s;ter.</HI> Men &s;eem not to be in doubt in other ca&s;es: If a man be called to a Mi|litary Po&s;t, he doubts not but he mu&s;t be ac|quainted with, and mu&s;t act by Military Skill. If a Man be called to a Chief place in a Ship, he doubts not but he mu&s;t now
<PB N="24" REF="003006_0015_0FEF9BCB77463138">u&s;e the Art of <HI>Navigation.</HI> If a Man be ap|pointed to be a Surveyor or Mea&s;urer of Land, he doubts not but he mu&s;t u&s;e the Art of <HI>Geometry.</HI> If a Man be called to the Work of the Mini&s;try, he mu&s;t now u&s;e the <HI>Mini&s;terial Gifts</HI> he has received. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 54 4. If a Man had be&s;towed on him the Gift of Tongues, and GOD &s;hould &s;end him to Preach to a Heathen People of a &s;trange Language, and he had no other way to make them under&s;tand, but by &s;peaking to them in their own Tongue, it would be his Duty to do &s;o, tho' GOD had never made any parti|cular mention of it in his Command. He ought to u&s;e the Ability that God had given him. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.11.</P>
<P>It were ea&s;y to multiply In&s;tances of this kind to make it plain, that GOD having be|&s;towed a Gift on men, enabling to the per|formance of a certain work, it &s;hould be im|proved about the Work, if God calls thereto.</P>
<P>Now we are to remember, there are Du|ties for Private Men to attend, and for the better di&s;charge of which, they want Gifts, and &s;hould Covet them; as the Gift of Pray|ing and the Gift of Singing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12 <HI>ult.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.4. And having Attained them they &s;hould Improve them in the doing of that Work they relate to, and enable to per|form. Wherefore I rea&s;on thus, Either GOD
<PB N="25" REF="003006_0015_0FEF9BCB77463138">has given this Gift or Art of <HI>Mu&s;ick</HI> to be im|proved in Singing Songs of Prai&s;e unto His Name, or Given it to be improved in plea|&s;ing Mens Lu&s;ts, or he has Given it in Vain: But not the Two Latter, and therefore the Former.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>I Argue in the next place from Scripture Precept and the agreeing Practice of the People of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>From what I have offered already, the matter might be Concluded which has been laid down to be Proved; and that it is not a matter of Indifferency how we Sing, but a matter of Duty to proceed by that ONE CERTAIN RULE. There are doubtle&s;s many things that are Duties, and Nece&s;&s;ary to be done, that we can find no particular Precept for, and yet may be fairly Argued to be Duties from &s;ome General Rules. Where do we find any Precept or Command to teach our Children to Read? And yet Who is there that does &s;o much as doubt of it? If it be their Duty to Read, then they &s;hould be enabled to do their Duty, by being learn'd to Read. And &s;o the Ca&s;e before us may be in this manner Argued to be a Duty, tho' there were no particular Precept about it. Its our Duty to Sing, and therefore we
<PB N="26" REF="003006_0016_0FEF9BCE6AB39C30">&s;hould endeavour to furni&s;h our&s;elves with the knowledge of the Rule. But be&s;ides this, GOD has been plea&s;ed to declare to us in the Scripture how his People of Old were wont to perform this Duty, and how he would have us do in the Affair.</P>
<P>And here, be&s;ides the General Precept, 1 Cor. 14.40. <HI>To do all things</HI> in the Publick Wor&s;hip of GOD <HI>Decently and in Order.</HI> Which certainly &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome Rule in a|greement with which Decency ly's.</P>
<P>We are Commanded to Sing with Un|der&s;tanding. Its an Old Te&s;tament Pre|cept. <HI>P&s;al</HI> 47.7. And its mentioned and re|newed in the New Te&s;tament, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.15. And becau&s;e it is &s;o, it makes it more plain to be under&s;tood. Its &s;afe&s;t to take the Scripture in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e; and then, there will be Three things contained in this Singing with the Under&s;tanding.</P>

<P>I &s;ee no Objection that can be made a|gain&s;t this account of the Text <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> then, as they &amp; we are Commanded to Sing with Un|der&s;tanding, &s;o its abundantly evident that
<PB N="27" REF="003006_0016_0FEF9BCE6AB39C30">the People of GOD of Old, did Sing thus.

Its plain from hence, That GOD's People did proceed by a Cer|tain Rule. There was care taken that tho&s;e that were to be concerned in Singing, &s;hould be furni&s;hed with Skill; and to that end, they were under the In&s;truction of One that was an Arti&s;t. It is plain, that the thing he taught them, was how to Sing: And there|fore it was the Art of MUSICK that he Taught. It is evident that he taught them to Sing by Rule; for it were very Impro|per to call him Skilful, in ca&s;e he were not acquainted with the Rule. It is evident their In&s;trumental Mu&s;ick was by Art, and &s;o it is al&s;o that their Vocal was 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 25. 7. <HI>They were In&s;tructed in the Songs of the Lord, all that were Cunning</HI> or Skilful.</P>
<P>And there is much of Argument for the point, to be drawn from the Titles of the P&s;alms. <HI>David</HI> having Compo&s;ed a P&s;alm, directed or delivered it to the Chief Mu&s;i|cian, to be Sung by the Rules of Art. And among the many Titles of the P&s;alms, we may take notice of &s;ome that plainly hold

And <HI>Alamoth,</HI> which intends the Treble, being &s;hrill like a Virgins Voice. Unto all which the A|po&s;tolical Precept may be added, Eph. 5.19. <HI>Speaking to your &s;olves in P&s;alms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, making Melody in your Heart to the Lord.</HI> Col. 3.16. <HI>Teaching and Admo|ni&s;hing one another, in P&s;alms, Hymns, and Spi|ritual Songs.</HI></P>

<P N="7">VII. <HI>Unle&s;s there be only One certain Rule,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>the excellent Ends to be Aimed at in the Performance of this Duty, cannot be &s;o well reached and gained.</HI></P>

<P>It is a very great Reflection on any Inge|nious Art, in u&s;e among Men, for any to &s;ay that all the ends of it may be gained as well without the Art as with it; for Men to &s;ay they can Sail as well without the Art of Navigation as with it; or, that they can do any thing in Arithmetick, as well with|out the Art as with it: or, that they can read
<PB N="30" REF="003006_0018_0FEF9BD4AF8F4718">any Author, without ever learning the Art of Reading. But its again&s;t the common &s;en&s;e of Mankind, and their daily experience, that the ends of Art can be gained &s;o well with|out the Art as with it.

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I don't &s;uppo&s;e, but that this Com|mon way of Singing may have &s;ome of the&s;e Good Effects. But then,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 I would Sugge&s;t this, its more than Probable, that it reaches the&s;e Good Ends, no further than its agreeing with the Rule. There are but Two ways (that I know of)
<PB N="31" REF="003006_0018_0FEF9BD4AF8F4718">in which the Duty can attain them; the one is Natural, from the Natural tendency in Mu&s;ick to move, or rai&s;e the Affections. The other is Moral, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD on the Ordinance. Now its readily Gran|ted, that &s;o far as the common way of Sing|ing agrees with the Rule, &s;o far it may in a natural way tend to rai&s;e the Affections, and &s;o far the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD may go a|long with it. For it is to be Remembred, that our Singing was Originally by Rule, the very Rule we now Plead for the u&s;e of. E|very Song that we Sing, was Originally Compo&s;ed by the Art of Mu&s;ick; and Di|rections given us to Sing the Tunes by. Which thing is as evident, as any thing of this Nature can be. Now tho' the Rule has been long neglected, and di&s;regarded, and we have &s;werved very much therefrom, in various Regards, yet is there in every Song that we Sing, &s;ome agreement with the Rule; and in proportion to what there is of agreement with the Rule, &s;o far it may both in a Natural, and in a Moral way have &s;ome of the&s;e Good Effects. But yet,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I would mind you in the next place, that this can be no certain Rule to Judge by, whether the Duty be well or ill done, that the Affections are moved or not moved.
<PB N="32" REF="003006_0019_0FEF95F98549E1C0">The Affections are indifferent to Good or Evil. We are liable to be much plea&s;ed with our performances, when as they are very unplea&s;ing to GOD.</ITEM>

<P>I take it for Granted, that none will Deny, but this Ordinance is liable to Cor|ruption. There can be no rea&s;on rendred why it &s;hould be impo&s;&s;ible to fall into a De|fective way.

<P>This Inference may &s;eem &s;omewhat Strange and Surpri&s;ing, that there &s;hould be any One Ordinance, to be attended on, in which we can neither do Well, nor Ill; and yet this is fairly drawn, and does mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily follow. It plainly appears from hence, Inasmuch as Well Doing lyes in a perfect Agreement with the Rule, and Ill Doing in a Di&s;agreement with the Rule This is the true and proper notion of Well Doing, and of Ill Doing, Gen. 4.7. <HI>If thou doe&s;t Well, &s;halt thou not be Accepted?

<P><PB N="36" REF="003006_0021_0FEF9BDCB48BFB08">
Study none will deny but that this A&s;tir does admit of Skill. There is &s;urely need of Skill to perform it. Should any deny it, it were ea&s;ie to Confute them from Scrip|ture and Rea&s;on too. It was accounted need|ful in Antient Times. When <HI>David</HI> had Compo&s;ed a P&s;alm, he directed it to the <HI>Chief Mu&s;ician,</HI> one that was excellently Skill'd. And 1 Chron. 15.22 <HI>Chenaniah lu&s;tructed about the Song becau&s;e be was Skilful.</HI> Skill was in tho&s;e times accounted needful; it was &s;ought after, and care was taken that tho&s;e that were to Sing might be turni&s;hed with Skill Yea a plain Command to u&s;e Skill, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 33 3. But in ca&s;e there be no certain Rule, there can be no Skill. And this is plain from the Nature of Skill, for Skill lyes in a due knowledge of the Rule, and aptne&s;s or readine&s;s to act by it, or in agreement with it, this is the true and proper Motion of Skill, as is plain from the In&s;tance given be|fore of Chenaniah. Its &s;aid he was Skilful. i. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. He was acquainted with the Rule, and able to guide others into the knowledge of it. And therefore the knowledge that many are &s;uppo&s;ed to have in Singing, who are ignorant of the Rule, is not Skill; No more than a Child can be &s;aid to have skill in Reading, becau&s;e he can &s;ay a few An&s;wers in the Catechi&s;m by Rote; when as it may

<P>I therefore Conclude this Argument thus, Either the matter does not require Skill, or Men are born Arti&s;ts, or el&s;e there is a certain Rule; but the two former mu&s;t be Deny'd, and therefore the la&s;t mu&s;t be A&s;&s;erted.</P>

<P>The de&s;ign of this Ordinance is to glorify GOD; and GOD who is the Object, that it is directed unto, being of &s;uch Tran&s;cendent Excellency and Glory, the Wor&s;hip &s;hould certainly be done in the be&s;t manner Po&s;&s;i|ble. It is very un&s;uitable and unbecoming to turn GOD off with that which is mean when as it is in our Power to do better, Mal. 1. 14. <HI>Cur&s;ed be the Deceiver who hath in his &s;tock a Male,</HI> &amp;c. But in ca&s;e there be no cer|tain Rule to proceed by, Advantage is put into the hands of Men to Affront the Ma|je&s;ty of Heaven without Tre&s;pa&s;s, by turn|ing Him off with what is mean, un&s;uitable and unbecoming. In ca&s;e GOD had not

And exctly thus, would it be in the Affair before us a|bout Singing, if there were no certain Rule to guide and govern the Affair. And in|deed, this is truly the fruit of our leaving the Rule, and taking our Direction from Cu&s;tom and Fancy.

<P>I &s;hall An&s;wer Briefly unto both of them. As to the Former,

<ITEM>[1] Its no Argument at all again&s;t the Truth, Warrantablene&s;s, Goodne&s;s of the thing, that &s;uch &s;ad things follow. We are wont to &s;ay, Fools Argue from the Event, but Wi&s;e Men from the Rule. This mat|ter has no tendency in its own nature to Divi&s;ions, but to Union, Peace and Love. And it is a cau&s;e of Divi&s;ions only by Acci|dent or an Occa&s;ion of them. The true cau&s;e of Contention is the Corruption and Lu&s;t in the Hearts of Men <HI>Jam</HI> 4.1. Whence came Wars and Fightings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> come they not hence, even of your <HI>Lu&s;ts?</HI> The very &s;ame Objection might be made again&s;t the Go&s;pel in the General, &amp; various particular Doctrines thereof. What Contentions have followed the Preaching of the Go&s;pel? And bitter Contentions about &s;ome particular Doctrines of the Go&s;pel? So that there can be no &s;olid Argument drawn from hence. But then,</ITEM>

<P>To which I An&s;wer,

<ITEM>1. Altho' its a Warrantable thing to be Zealou&s;ly affected in a thing that is Good. <HI>Gal.</HI> 4 8. However I readily Grant,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Our Zeal &s;hould be under the Go|vernment of Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice. We mu&s;t duly di&s;tingui&s;h between the more and le&s;s weighty things of the Law, and propor|tion out our Zeal accordingly. Not ma|king &s;o great a Fire to Roa&s;t an Egg, as an Ox. And yet ought we to account every branch and particle of Truth to be precious and worthy of our purcha&s;e. And there|fore we are not camely to yield up the cau&s;e of Truth, becau&s;e a &s;maller Truth and Op|po&s;ed, but a&s;&s;ert it, and &s;ufficiently prove it, That &s;o in ca&s;e we can't gain a Reception of it, without loo&s;ing a greater Good (I mean Peace) we may with a good Con&s;cience De&s;i&s;t and Wait, leaving the Guilt at the Door of the Oppo&s;ers and Gain&s;ayers.</ITEM>

<ITEM>(2) There can be no advantage in this oppo&s;ing and &s;peaking Evil. If the thing be of GOD, it will be a Vain thing to Strive again&s;t Him, and to Kick again&s;t the Pricks. <HI>Job.</HI> 9.4. Act. 9.5 &amp; 5.39. <HI>If it be of GOD, ye cannot Overthrow it, le&s;t haply ye be found to Fighs again&s;t GOD.</HI></ITEM>
