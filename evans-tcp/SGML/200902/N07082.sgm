<P>WHILE Paul continued at Rome the &s;aints of Philippi rai&s;ed a gratuity for his relief, and &s;ent Epaphroditus to pre&s;ent it to their &s;uffering apo&s;tle. Epaphroditus, after a dangerous &s;ick|ne&s;s, returning home to Philippi, St. Paul &s;ent by him this letter of thanks to that beneficent a&s;&s;embly of chri&s;|tians, who had liberally contributed to his relief. Tho' this incident was the occa&s;ion of this epi&s;tle, yet the apo&s;tle takes this opportunity to impart &s;ome good gifts to them of a &s;piritual nature, in return for their affection and tem|poral relief. Be&s;ides &s;ome elucidations and bright touches on the peculiar doctrines of the chri&s;tian faith, doctrines however common to the church univer&s;al in all ages; and be&s;ides &s;ome incidental reflexions on the then pre&s;ent &s;tates of the chri&s;tian cau&s;e;&mdash;he inter&s;per&s;es the whole with ob&s;ervations adapted to the peculiar &s;tate of things at Philippi. If we con&s;ider this, it will very much a&s;&s;i&s;t us

in under&s;tanding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;everal parts of this epi&s;tle. And in|deed we &s;hall find the apo&s;tle in all his letters his a ge|neral eye to the particular circum&s;tances of the church or per&s;on to whom he writes&mdash;and many &s;entences and allu|&s;ions are re&s;tricted by the&s;e views. His mo&s;t exten&s;ive de&s;ign, in all his epi&s;tles, was to confirm the faithful: to which end he attentively in&s;pected the &s;tate of the churches, and according to their different exigences, he imparted his &s;piritual advice and apo&s;tolic exhortation.</P>
<P>The &s;aints at Philippi were united in a good opinion of &s;aint Paul, their &s;piritual father, and paid a high regard to his dictates and advice, whether given by in&s;piration, or his own private judgment. And he made u&s;e of this in|fluence, nor to aggrandize him&s;elf, but to &s;erve the cau&s;e of the redeemer, by &s;ettling and reconciling differences and animo&s;ities, by cultivating that fellow&s;hip and union; which being enlarged to the comprehen&s;ion of a numerous body of chri&s;tians, was appointed to &s;uccede the miraculous powers in &s;upporting and diffu&s;ing chri&s;tianity through the world. God's ways are con&s;ummately wi&s;e. In the in|fancy of the go&s;pel, the miraculous powers &s;ub&s;erved two ends, the <HI>&s;upport</HI> and <HI>evidence,</HI> or verification, of chri&s;|tianity. And having, demon&s;trably atte&s;ted the cau&s;e, and &s;upernaturally upheld it again&s;t all oppo&s;ition, till it had formed &s;uch an intere&s;t among men, as, being cemented by the noble principle of union and benevolence, it might &s;upport and propagate it&s;elf in a natural way, the&s;e powers were gradually withdrawn, when effectual care had been taken for the &s;ecurity of the go&s;pel. The tran&s;mitting of it therefore in &s;ome mea&s;ure devolved it&s;elf on its con|verts, under the all-controlling, over-ruling providence of heaven. Tho' God accompli&s;hes his moral, as well as natural ends, by &s;econdary cau&s;es and &s;ubordinate means; yet there is room for the concurrent agency of the&s;e cau&s;es&mdash;and hence we are to work together with God. The apo&s;tles took early care, as the number of the faithful
<PB N="5" REF="009018_0004_10306DE8491AE6F0">
increa&s;ed, to recommend this u&s;eful principle of union and benevolence, which, cementing the body of believers, &s;hould in due time form an impregnable <HI>e&s;pirit du corps</HI> to &s;uccede the &s;upernatural effu&s;ions of the divine &s;pirit, and co-operate with God in carrying on and &s;upporting the &s;ame great de&s;ign. Even in the infancy of the churches&mdash; while being too &s;mall to form re&s;pectable unions; and con&s;equently while yet they could not &s;ee and feel the immediate u&s;e which was afterwards to be made of the heavenly principles of <HI>love</HI> and <HI>forgivene&s;s</HI> taught by their divine ma&s;ter:&mdash;The apo&s;tles carefully watched this prin|ciple, took peculiar care to implant and cultivate it, and u&s;ed apo&s;tolic authority in recommending it.</P>
<P>And as the church multiplied, they were very attentive to extingui&s;h animo&s;ities and heal differences, in one part and another: which aro&s;e, not from the nature of the chri&s;tian in&s;titution, but from partial under&s;tanding of it, and from early imbibed prejudices, not at once to be worn off, and which the apo&s;tles treated with the utmo&s;t ten|derne&s;s and wi&s;dom. Be&s;ides what were incidental to par|ticular churches there were other mi&s;takes of greater ex|tent. The Jews were di&s;per&s;ed throughout the Roman empire, and &s;ettled in great numbers in Greece, Macedo|nia, and around the Archipelago. And though chri&s;tianity never made any great impre&s;&s;ion on the body of that people, yet a few in almo&s;t every place became converts. The&s;e few neverthele&s;s occa&s;ioned a very capital controver&s;y, not ea&s;ily &s;ettled by apo&s;tolic authority, which takes up &s;ome part of almo&s;t every book of the new-te&s;tament, ex|cept the evangeli&s;ts: a controver&s;y, which, being different|ly apprehended by chri&s;tians of &s;ucceeding ages, has given birth to polemical divinity or controver&s;y on the doctrines of faith. The few Jewi&s;h converts did at fir&s;t receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the Me&s;&s;iah on the evidence of his <HI>re&s;ur|rection</HI> chiefly and other <HI>miracles,</HI> and partly in <HI>fulfilment of prophecy:</HI> but did not imagine that either <HI>circumci&s;ion</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="009018_0005_10306DEA02B55048">
or the <HI>law</HI> was to be aboli&s;hed, They therefore u&s;ed their endeavours to bring the Gentile chri&s;tians to the law; and though they received Chri&s;t, yet their great dependance was on the law: They accordingly tru&s;ted for acceptance and ju&s;tification to the works of the law, of more impor|tance with them than that <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s which is through the faith of Chri&s;t, the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith.</HI> There were other Jewi&s;h converts, who tho' they did not lay the chief &s;tre&s;s on the deeds of the law, yet thought the ob&s;ervance of it nece&s;&s;ary, tru&s;ting neverthe|le&s;s in the atonement of Chri&s;t, and preferring the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s by faith. The former were dangerous, being really enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t: the latter were tolerable, and might &s;afely be received into the fellow&s;hip of the go&s;pel; it was nece&s;&s;ary to act in &s;teady oppo&s;ition to the one, with the utmo&s;t conde&s;cention and humanity to the other.</P>
<P>The body of <HI>hebrew chri&s;tians</HI> from the beginning re|tained <HI>circumci&s;ion</HI> and <HI>the law,</HI> which St. Paul had de|clared to be right for them, though not for the <HI>gentile chri&s;tians.</HI> With difficulty the apo&s;tle kept them united in his day: but &s;oon after his death the Hebrew converts broke off all charity and communion with the Gentile con|verts, becau&s;e the latter would not ob&s;erve <HI>circumci&s;ion</HI> and the <HI>law.</HI> They were long after di&s;tingui&s;hed and known by the name of <HI>Nazarene,</HI> or circumci&s;ed, chri&s;ti|ans. The <HI>Copti</HI> chri&s;tians <HI>circumci&s;e</HI> to this day. <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI> the hi&s;torian is &s;aid to have at la&s;t joined him&s;elf to tho&s;e <HI>believing Jews,</HI> who about his time broke off all communication with the <HI>believing Gentiles. Epiphanius</HI> was acquainted with them, A. D. 370, and called them <HI>he|retics,</HI> "for no other rea&s;on that I can perceive, but that they together with their chri&s;tian faith, continued the u&s;e of <HI>circumci&s;ion</HI> and the jewi&s;h <HI>law;</HI> which is a thing St. Paul never blamed in a <HI>jewi&s;h chri&s;tian.</HI>" He might have cen&s;ured St. James and tho&s;e thou&s;ands of the Jeru&s;alem
<PB N="7" REF="009018_0006_10306DEBD8CB1B60">
and Galilee chri&s;tians for hereticks, concerning whom St. James &s;aid to St. Paul, Acts 21.20. <HI>Thou &s;ee&s;t, br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther, how many thou&s;ands of Jews there are, which</HI> BELIEVE, <HI>and they are</HI> ALL <HI>zealous of the</HI> LAW.</P>
<P>This controver&s;y had affected the church at Philippi; and perhaps Euodias and Syntiche might be Jewi&s;h con|verts, and very much at the head of it; the apo&s;tle &s;ays, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t crafty and inde|fatigable in pro&s;elyting the Gentile chri&s;tians to the cere|monial, pompous, burden&s;ome in&s;titution of Mo&s;es, <HI>beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the conci&s;ion;</HI> which plainly &s;hews they were in danger from the quarter of which I have been &s;peaking. The apo&s;tle therefore exhorts them to beware, to take heed, to be on their guard with re&s;pect to tho&s;e teachers who enjoin circumci&s;ion, the ceremonial rites, the ob&s;ervation of Jewi&s;h holy-days, new-moons, and other fe&s;tivals, and <HI>place the e&s;&s;ence of chri&s;tianity in the&s;e things.</HI> And he takes occa&s;ion to pro|duce his own example in evidence&mdash;by which it appeared that he had been in every re&s;pect a Hebrew, &s;tood com|plete in that righteou&s;ne&s;s which was of the law: but &s;ince his &s;oul had been enlightened with the in valuable di&s;co|veries of the excellency of the knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, he counted all his boa&s;ted attainments in judai&s;m as a trifle, de&s;iring henceforward to be found in Chri&s;t, not having on his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which was of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chri&s;t. Having entirely broke off from judai&s;m, being convinced that it was &s;uper|ceded by a more perfect and &s;ublime and &s;piritual in&s;titu|tion&punc; he pre&s;&s;ed forward to perfection in Chri&s;t&mdash;and being de&s;irous to unite as many as po&s;&s;ible with him, he was willing to walk <HI>together</HI> with his brethren the Hebrew chri&s;tians <HI>as far as they had attained,</HI> who &s;incerely be|lieved in Chri&s;t, yet thought them&s;elves obliged to ob&s;erve the law. If they placed their dependance on Chri&s;t for acceptance, they might be indulged their peculiar affection
<PB N="8" REF="009018_0007_10306DF419F15F68">
for the ob&s;ervance of their law, provided they would be content that the Gentile converts &s;hould be at liberty on the&s;e matters; it being far better for tho&s;e that agreed in e&s;&s;entials, to live in harmony and fellow&s;hip, than under the mo&s;t &s;pecious pretexts to re&s;olve them&s;elves into fruit|le&s;s, undeterminable controver&s;y and alienation. And then the apo&s;tle introduces this general advice, equally appli|cable to all, whether Jewi&s;h or Gentile converts, &s;o far as they had attained, to walk by the &s;ame rule, and mind the &s;ame thing. This harmony would cement them into a re&s;pectable body, and perfect them in that benevolence and chri&s;tian charity, without which they were nothing.</P>
<P>Having thus fini&s;hed the nece&s;&s;ary illu&s;tration of the text; I proceed to what I had principally in view, the application of it to us, my brethren, of the <HI>congregational</HI> denomina|tion, as well in New-England in general, as the particular di&s;trict of this colony. And in order to procede clearly, and perceive that the principle of union recommended in the text, may be applicable and take place among our churches, I &s;hall</P>
<P N="1">I. Enumerate &s;ome of tho&s;e fundamental principles of chri&s;tianity and eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity, in which our churches are generally agreed.</P>
<P N="2">II. I &s;hall mention &s;ome things on which we differ in opinion, or are &s;uppo&s;ed to differ; and &s;hew that this difference need not to ob&s;truct the general harmony and union&mdash;and that the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed differences might be great|ly le&s;&s;ened by benevolent and honorable conce&s;&s;ions. And</P>
<P N="3">III. Subjoin &s;ome rea&s;ons, taken from the importance of the common cau&s;e, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our churches, to &s;hew the wi&s;dom and advantage of union and good fel|low&s;hip, both among the mini&s;ters and the churches.</P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall enumerate &s;ome of the fundamental principles of revelation in which we are generally agreed. I &s;hall not confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e things which congregationali&s;ts particularly agree in&mdash;but &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention
<PB N="9" REF="009018_0008_10306DF6392CD740">
&s;everal things in which we have the happine&s;s to agree with the prote&s;tant churches throughout the world; as well as others more peculiar to our own denomination.</P>
<P N="1">1. We agree in the being and character of God. The author of the univer&s;e is him&s;elf underived and indepen|dent:&mdash;a being of ab&s;olute excellence and dignity, eter|nally happy and glorious of him&s;elf:&mdash;a being but im|perfectly apprehended, known but in part by man:&mdash; a being in him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all po&s;&s;ible perfection in a degree incomprehen&s;ible by our limited apprehen&s;ions; having be&s;ides tho&s;e, who&s;e illu&s;trations we have the honor of perceiving, perhaps many perfections unknown to us. The di&s;plays of Deity to our little world lead our con|templations to four di&s;tinctions of perfection, which yet may be but one principle in the divine e&s;&s;ence, I mean <HI>omnipotence, wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, mercy.</HI> His wi&s;dom im|plies <HI>omni&s;cience</HI> and per&s;onal rectitude with re&s;pect to him&s;elf:&mdash;With regard to the production and government of a &s;uppo&s;ed dependent creation, his infinite wi&s;dom mu&s;t di&s;cern and project and execute the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t plan of a univer&s;e;&mdash;<HI>wi&s;e&s;t</HI> becau&s;e infinite di&s;cernment mu&s;t perceive the only one, than which there is not another wi&s;er, and in which the mo&s;t complicated various and no|ble ends are accompli&s;hed in the &s;horte&s;t manner, accord|ing to the fewe&s;t &s;imple&s;t general laws;&mdash;<HI>wi&s;e&s;t</HI> becau&s;e admitting all po&s;&s;ible &s;ubordinations and variety of action, happine&s;s and &s;ocial connexion;&mdash;therefore la&s;tly, <HI>wi&s;e&s;t</HI> and <HI>be&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e mo&s;t declarative of the divine glory, and eventually productive of the greate&s;t quantity of the uni|ver&s;al happine&s;s.&mdash;I &s;ay, <HI>divine wi&s;dom,</HI> of &s;y&s;tems po&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t chu&s;e that be&s;t one, which <HI>omnipotence</HI> prompted by infinite <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> might give exi&s;tence to and perpetuate. We view the Deity at the head of the moral &s;y&s;tem as exerci&s;ing a &s;uperintendant moral go|vernment, &s;upreme dominion, all-controlling and ever|la&s;ting <HI>providence.</HI> And tho' the divine complacency be
<PB N="10" REF="009018_0009_10306DF7F3B97098">
apportioned to the degrees of native or acquired excellence of every order and every individual; yet impartial equity takes place in the divine di&s;pen&s;ations and conduct to|wards all the &s;ubordinations of being from infinite to no|thing. This &s;ugge&s;ts the idea of divine <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> founded in and flowing from infinite wi&s;dom, which, with re&s;pect to the unhappy beings who tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of eternal order, is exerci&s;ed in connecting eventual puni&s;hment with un|amending impenitence. The exerci&s;e of goodne&s;s to a revolted world is <HI>mercy:</HI>&mdash;which, as the univer&s;e mu&s;t be a production very generally virtuous and right, is ex|erci&s;ed that we know of towards no part of the creation, but this unhappy region which we inhabit. This general idea of the Deity and his character I &s;uppo&s;e we are agreed in.</P>
<P N="2">2. That notwith&s;tanding God created this, as he did all other worlds, in order and rectitude, yet that we are now in a fallen and univer&s;ally depraved &s;tate. I truly take this principle to be very generally agreeable to the opinion of our churches&mdash;however individuals may differ as to the origin and de&s;ert of moral evil. Some may at|tribute it to vicious example, &s;ome to the di&s;order of our external &s;tate, or the animal part of man, &s;ome to a prin|ciple of pollution born in us, and derived from Adam. But however we may vary in our opinions as to the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent reigning univer&s;al depravity; yet two things I &s;uppo&s;e we agree in with re&s;pect to it&mdash;one, that no blame is to be a&s;cribed to God as the author of it; the other, that it is fact. Ob&s;ervation on the &s;tate of the world for 6000 years, or the review of it in hi&s;tory, &s;hew that in fact di&s;order and vicious principle are predominant and reign with great &s;trength in human nature. The univer&s;ality of the effect &s;hews a tendency and proclivity in our nature at pre&s;ent, howevever derived there; a pro|clivity which may be termed a characteri&s;tic or general principle of our pre&s;ent nature, even on allowance of
<PB N="11" REF="009018_0010_10306DFAC01E4DD0">
the &s;uppo&s;ed exceptions, which in my opinion are not to be admitted, &s;ince this vicious principle has not been in fact controlled by the philo&s;ophers or their wi&s;e&s;t moral &s;y&s;tems, but has raged in the mo&s;t enlightened and im|proved nations, more than among the &s;avages them&s;elves. From which there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that no one of the human race is de&s;titute of it. Our &s;ouls may come out of the hands of God pure and unpolluted, and the pol|lution take place upon our entering this &s;tate. Nor is it the re&s;ult of per&s;onal action alone: it may perhaps be im|po&s;&s;ible for an innocent and unexperienced mind, com|mencing its infant exi&s;tence in a polluted world, not to be very &s;oon affected with the contagion. The great Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has re&s;embled the infant mind to a ra&s;a tabula, as he expre&s;&s;es it, a clean piece of paper, with no in&s;criptions, tho' &s;u&s;ceptible of them. This is equally true of inter|nal propen&s;ities, as of acqui&s;itions in knowledge. Some indeed &s;uppo&s;e or &s;peak, as if they &s;uppo&s;ed that the pure and holy God infu&s;ed into the &s;oul at its fir&s;t creation, and on its entrance into the world, the impure and unholy propen&s;ities both of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, which we find to have u&s;urped the governing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of us by the time we become capable of moral action; and con&s;equently that our natures, as they come out of the hand of the benevo|lent creator, are corrupt, impure and unholy. But the learned pre&s;ident EDWARDS has a&s;&s;erted, that the doctrine of original &s;in, according to the &s;en&s;e and explication of the mo&s;t orthodox divines, implies no &s;uch thing:&mdash; but that, we coming pure out of the hands of God, our impurity and moral defilement is altogether con&s;equential upon our entrance into this world. I beg leave to &s;ubjoin his own words. Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, &s;ays he, <Q>the doctrine of original &s;in to imply that nature mu&s;t be corrupted by &s;ome <HI>po&s;itive influence;</HI> &s;omething by &s;ome means or other <HI>infu&s;ed</HI> into the human nature; &s;ome <HI>quality</HI> or other, not from the choice of our
<PB N="12" REF="009018_0011_10306DFF88C0FF50">
minds but like a <HI>teint, tincture</HI> or <HI>infection,</HI> altering the natural con&s;titution, faculties &amp; di&s;po&s;itions of our &s;ouls: &mdash;that &s;in and evil di&s;po&s;itions are implanted in the foetus in the womb.</Q> <Q>Whereas truly our doctrine, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> neither implies nor infers any &s;uch thing. In order to account for a &s;inful corruption of nature, yea a total native depravity of heart, there is not the lea&s;t need of &s;uppo&s;ing any evil quality <HI>infu&s;ed, implanted,</HI> or <HI>wrought</HI> into the nature of man, by any <HI>po&s;itive</HI> cau&s;e or influence what&s;oever, either from God or the creature: or of &s;uppo&s;ing that man is conceived and born with a <HI>fountain of evil</HI> in his heart, &s;uch as is any thing properly po&s;itive. I think a little attention to the nature of things will be &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy any impartial, con&s;iderate in|quirer, that the ab&s;ence of <HI>po&s;itive good</HI> principles, and &s;o the with-holding of a &s;pecial divine influence to im|part and maintain the&s;e good principles, leaving the com|mon natural principle of &s;elf-love, natural appetite, &amp;c. (which were in man in innocence) leaving the&s;e, I &s;ay, to them&s;elves, without the government of &s;uperior, divine principles, will certainly be followed with the corrup|tion, yea the total corruption of the heart, without occa|&s;ion of any po&s;itive influence at all: and that it was thus indeed that corruption of nature came on Adam imme|diately on his fall, and comes on all his po&s;terity, as &s;inning in him, and falling with him. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards's An&s;. to Taylor, p. 316</NOTE></Q> The&s;e ob&s;er|vations appear to me to be very ju&s;t.

trial,) but entering a corrupted and di&s;ordered &s;tate de&s;titute of a po&s;itive propen&s;ity to holine&s;s, tho' with no po&s;itive propen&s;ity to ill, the latter immediately takes place in our natures, and by the time we arrive to the years of moral di&s;cretion, we find our&s;elves one and all to have fallen a &s;acrifice to pollution. Jehovah could have im|planted in us a propen&s;ity or tendency to virtue of &s;uffi|cient &s;trength to overcome the corruption of this &s;tate&mdash; but he has not done it. The &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;tinctive love of virtue, and the impul&s;es of the moral &s;en&s;e, are evidently too weak for eventual &s;ecurity. Why God did not infu&s;e a controlling propen&s;ity to holine&s;s is to be re&s;olved into his &s;overeignty and unfathomable councils; which might with great ju&s;tice, and agreeable to the analogy of nature and daily experience, take occa&s;ion from Adam's offence, to with-hold from his po&s;terity a favor which he had granted to Adam him&s;elf, and mo&s;t probably had per|petuated to his po&s;terity on the obedience of their faederal head. This is an intricate &s;ubject&mdash;the reconciling the permi&s;&s;ion of moral and natural ill with the perfections of God&mdash;let it be brought about in what manner &s;oever, &s;ince he had power to have prevented it. If therefore we &s;hould differ in our manner of accounting for it, and even if we &s;hould mi&s;conceive the &s;cripture account of its origin (in which I apprehend it is clearly defined), and yet agree in the fact that di&s;order and moral depravity now reign in this part of God's univer&s;e, to a degree uncon|trollable by man, perhaps we &s;hall agree in the main thing.</P>
<P N="3">3. I take it that we further agree that it is beyond the power of man to recover and &s;ave him&s;elf. Methinks a little attentive view of our &s;tate might convince us not only that there is no probability, but that there is an ab|&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of this worlds emerging from its di&s;|order, and recovering its original rectitude of it&s;elf. A &s;pectator from yonder di&s;tant dominions of Jehovah might lock down upon this world, and pronounce it utterly lo&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="009018_0013_10306E04C997BFE0">
and undone beyond any po&s;&s;ibility of &s;elf-recovery. He might &s;ee the principle of moral rectitude, even &s;uppo&s;e it not quite extinct, yet &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed as not po&s;&s;ibly to regain its dominion. In this attempt the mo&s;t enlightned and poli&s;hed heathen nations, Greece and Rome, as well as the modern refiners in rea&s;oning, have intirely failed. And as no general &s;ucce&s;sful reformation, either of the moral principle or practice, is ever to be expected from mankind con&s;idered as a collective body, while in a &s;tate of nature unenlightened by a &s;upernatural revelation; &s;o there is but too much rea&s;on to believe the &s;ame thing holds true of individuals. And if we &s;hould be inclined to make an exception in favor of the pagan nations, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the effect of the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, thro' which, tho' unknown to them, the &s;pirit might regenerate a principle of holine&s;s in them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Patten's Apolo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 16.</NOTE> But even this would &s;hew that nature alone is utterly impotent to this great change. With re&s;pect therefore to the reco|very of the principle of holine&s;s, as well as the extirpa|tion of the principle of pollution, our nature left to it&s;elf is intirely impotent.</P>
<P>But towards our &s;alvation, there is nece&s;&s;ary another thing which I &s;uppo&s;e we all agree is ab&s;olutely beyond human power, even in full perfection, I mean rendering atonement for &s;in. The oeconomy of the kingdom of grace, and the de&s;ignation of the &s;on of God to the &s;ove|reignty of this world, the introduction of the offers of grace, the exhibition of an example of perfect virtuous practice under all its embarra&s;&s;ment, the opening and &s;et|ting up this kingdom; infinite wi&s;dom it &s;eems &s;aw could not be effected without that humiliation of the &s;on of God, his mediatorial obedience and vicarious &s;ufferings, on which the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace is meritoriou&s;ly founded. This &s;hews us that without the divine &s;upernatural in|terpo&s;ition, the world was ab&s;olutely lo&s;t and undone. The
<PB N="15" REF="009018_0014_10306E0683AFF458">
true nature of atonement is perhaps but imperfectly ap|prehended by us:&mdash;but methinks we might all &s;ee that, in whatever it con&s;i&s;ts, it is a thing beyond human power to render. Is it not bla&s;phemy for a depraved helple&s;s being to &s;ay he can do aught of him&s;elf which &s;hall merit pardon of an offended God? Could he be perfect for the future, nay perform an overplus of virtue of merit equal to the demerit of his offences, yet on the foot of ju&s;tice he could have no demand on the &s;overeign mercy of God. Divine ju&s;tice is not thus to be bought and &s;old. But even Adam in innocence could perform no works of &s;upererrogation, or more than his duty: and &s;hall his im|potent &s;ons profanely boa&s;t that they can atchieve a &s;ur|plus of holine&s;s for the &s;atisfaction of divine ju&s;tice? And con&s;equently could we be &s;uppo&s;ed to have power to be|come holy the re&s;t of our lives, there remains a load of pa&s;t &s;ins uncancelled, undi&s;charged, who&s;e penalties we are liable to.</P>
<P>It is beyond our power then to lay the foundation of our redemption, which Je&s;us Chri&s;t has laid in the pro|pitiatory &s;acrifice of him&s;elf. Equally unable are we, without the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to tho&s;e terms and conditi|ons appointed to be found in us, towards our receiving the atonement and becoming entitled to the ble&s;&s;ings of this &s;acrifice. Otherwi&s;e the illuminations of the holy Gho&s;t had not been by infinite wi&s;dom judged nece&s;&s;ary to accompli&s;h on the human mind the great work of <HI>con|viction, repentance, faith,</HI> and <HI>regeneration.</HI> As the <HI>atone|ment</HI> is the foundation of our di&s;charge from the future penalties of moral evil; &s;o <HI>faith</HI> is the appointed condi|tion of limiting the atonement to us; and <HI>renovation</HI> of nature is nece&s;&s;ary to the enjoyment of the future ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s. Had I time I might enlarge on the de&s;cription of this divine principle, its formation and exerci&s;e, as it affects our &s;piritual powers and pa&s;&s;ions, which are directed, re&s;tricted to and placed upon new moral objects, new pur&s;uits, new enjoyments.</P>

<P N="5">5. We agree in the influences and operations of the &s;pirit, the third per&s;on in the adorable trinity concerned in man's redemption, who&s;e more immediate province is the application of this redemption to the &s;oul. Je&s;us Chri&s;t having begun this good work, does not de&s;ert it. Had he for&s;aken it after his leaving the world, it had proved abortive. He &s;owed the good &s;eed in one part of the great field of the world, and leaves it to propagate and &s;pread as the &s;pirit breaks up the fallow ground, and prepares one nation after another to receive it. The &s;ame thing is to be done for individuals as for nations: Tho' evangelical truth is of a regenerating influence when

brought home to the &s;oul, or as Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, "to our bo&s;oms;" yet the human mind is to be fir&s;t pre|pared and &s;oftened to the genial impre&s;&s;ions of truth, which would be inefficacious alone. By an acce&s;s to, and operation on, the human intellect, which we cannot define, the &s;pirit, as we are informed by revelation, di&s;pels the mi&s;ts which becloud and darken the under&s;tanding, and, being duly attended to, leads us to di&s;cern and feel the force of the truth as it is in Je&s;us. And thus he brings the &s;oul, after a previous moral proce&s;s, to two great prin|ciples, di&s;tinct in their nature and connexions, though in|&s;eparably conjoined in the &s;oul of a chri&s;tian, I mean, &s;av|ing <HI>faith</HI> and the principle of <HI>regeneration</HI> we have been &s;peaking of. By the one I mean, not the lax indefinite faith of a &s;uperficial education, tho' this mu&s;t be allowed to have had a good effect upon the world;&mdash;not the cur|&s;ory belief, or rather non-disbelief, of Je&s;us and his reli|ligion, with which debauchees and devils <HI>believe, tremble,</HI> and <HI>&s;in</HI> away;&mdash;and lea&s;t of all, not that dei&s;tical faith by which we a&s;&s;ent equally to the dictates of Je&s;us, of Plato, of Ari&s;totle, of Mahomet, and Bolingbroke, and to nei|ther as &s;upernaturally authorized to in&s;truct and govern man:&mdash;but, be&s;ides the hone&s;t and &s;ober belief of reve|lation in general, I mean the affiance of the &s;oul in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that act of the human mind, by which, in con&s;e|quence of our being intirely convinced that Je&s;us is ap|pointed our redeemer and king, we humbly accept and &s;ubmit to him as &s;uch&mdash;that act by which the &s;oul, from a &s;en&s;e of its lo&s;t &s;tate and inability to &s;ave it&s;elf, full of the ravi&s;hing views of the all-&s;ufficiency of Je&s;us, and the benevolent invitations of the go&s;pel, humbly comes to Chri&s;t, repairs to him as the ark of &s;afety, receives and embraces and lays hold on him as the only hope &s;et before it, in virtue of who&s;e propitiation and meritorious righte|ou&s;ne&s;s alone it tru&s;ts for acceptance with the father. The other principle I mentioned was <HI>regeneration,</HI> in
<PB N="19" REF="009018_0018_10306E1212C35840">
which the &s;oul in all its powers and affections is purified, refined and created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: a love and complacency in virtue is generated, a &s;trong prevalent and governing affection for holine&s;s, a prevailing tendency to moral rectitude: in a word, a &s;park of the divine na|ture is infu&s;ed and lights up the principle of divine love and benevolence, that di&s;tingui&s;hing part of the moral image of God in which he created man. The&s;e princi|ples, <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>regeneration,</HI> are &s;upported thro' the whole cour&s;e of the religious life, by the &s;ame energies of the holy &s;pirit that at fir&s;t formed them. Again,</P>
<P N="6">6. I &s;uppo&s;e we are further agreed in the con&s;equences and connexions of the&s;e two principles&mdash;the one in go|verning a holy life, and exemplifying or rather diver&s;ify|ing it&s;elf in all the graces and ornaments of the moral behavior:&mdash;the other in our <HI>ju&s;tification,</HI> or intitling us, not by way of merit, but according to the con&s;titution of grace, to all the benefits of the mediatorial atonement.</P>
<P>Faith is the appointed term in us which limits and ap|propriates the atonement. But it mu&s;t be &s;incere, unfeigned, and attended with a holy life. <HI>He that believes &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> It is through faith that we become &s;o united to the meritorious redeemer, as to receive and &s;hare in the benefits of his mo&s;t illu&s;trious virtue:&mdash;which, be&s;ides a di&s;charge from puni&s;hment, entitles to ine&s;timable glories, priviledges and happine&s;s, over and above the peculiar re|wards which God will graciou&s;ly be&s;tow on our per&s;onal virtue &amp; holine&s;s&mdash;The&s;e la&s;t are intirely di&s;tinct from the high privileges and glorious beatifying dignity and advance|ment, which are derived to believers on account of their connexion with &s;uch an illu&s;trious per&s;onage in the moral world, as the eternal &s;on of God. <HI>Thus they that receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall reign in life by one Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> To the&s;e glories ju&s;ti|fication opens the way.

<PB N="20" REF="009018_0019_10306E18384D19E8">
holy life, but with <HI>faith</HI> only: not that faith is alone, but however attended with other good principles, it is faith only with which ju&s;tification is connected. This is the ap|pointed term, which, being found in us, en&s;eals our re|demption, on our part compleats our title to all the benefits of the mediatorial obedience. There are indeed &s;ome different apprehen&s;ions among us on this &s;ubject. We all agree that Chri&s;t is the great propitiation:&mdash;we do not place the propitiation in <HI>faith</HI> or <HI>good works.</HI> The only que&s;tion then is, what is the condition and appointed term <HI>in us</HI> which entitles us to the benefits and fruits of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s? It is agreed on all hands, that whatever it is, it is not however meritorious; nor is the connexion be|tween this term and receiving the atonement &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as to preclude the &s;overeignty of grace. Now to this con|dition, whatever it is, as well as to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and the grace of God. the &s;cripture indifferently gives the appellation <HI>"ju&s;tifying."</HI> The apo&s;tle Paul &s;peaking of this conditional term in us, &s;ays, "being ju&s;ti|fied by <HI>faith:</HI>"&mdash;St. James &s;peaking of the conditional term &s;ays, "ye &s;ee then how by <HI>works</HI> a man is ju&s;tified, and not by faith only:"&mdash;the apo&s;tle &s;peaking of the procur|ing cau&s;e and meritorious foundation of ju&s;tification &s;ays, "being ju&s;tified by his <HI>blood:</HI>"&mdash;&s;peaking of the &s;ource and origen of it in the &s;overeign and free mercy of God, he &s;ays, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> being ju&s;tified freely by his <HI>grace</HI> through the re|demption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t." It is to be ob&s;erved, that the Hebrew chri&s;tians tru&s;ted for ju&s;tification to the works of the law. In oppo&s;ition to this, the apo&s;tles endeavoured to bring them off from this vain tru&s;t, to place their &s;ole dependance on Chri&s;t's atonement and &s;acrifice once for all&mdash;teaching them that faith was the only term of being entitled to the benefits of this atonement, without the deeds of the Mo&s;aic law. Some Gentile converts &s;eeing &s;o much &s;tre&s;s laid on <HI>faith,</HI> and neglect of the <HI>law,</HI> forgot the di&s;|tinction between the temporary and already abrogated laws
<PB N="21" REF="009018_0020_10306E19EC0A0858">
of Mo&s;es, and the perpetuity of the moral law, and &s;o ran into the extreme of tru&s;ting to faith alone, and by it&s;elf. This is the error &s;aint James corrects, by &s;hewing that <HI>faith being alone is dead;</HI> and that it is only &s;uch a living faith as influences to virtue, which is ju&s;tifying. Not that faith is to be tru&s;ted to as meriting ju&s;tification, any more than the good works it produces. To rectify &s;till further this early abu&s;e of faith, the apo&s;tle calls up the chief attention to a holy life or good works, not to the works of the law, but of evangelical obedience, and &s;peaks of them as a condition of ju&s;tification joyntly with faith. It is evident indeed that a life of good acts is preferable in point of excellence and value, to the one &s;ingle good act of faith: but as real faith opens the virtuous life, and determines the future tendency of the character, infinite wi&s;dom has &s;een fit to make it on our part the character|i&s;tic condition or term of ju&s;tification. The&s;e things do not bow to our rea&s;on, much le&s;s to our revieries. The proper and indeed only que&s;tion is, what &s;aith the &s;crip|ture? What is the term and condition pre&s;cribed by God? If faith, or good works, &s;eparately or conjunctly&mdash;we are to &s;ubmit. By good works it is to be remembred we agree to under&s;tand a <HI>holy and godly life,</HI> a life <HI>governed by a real principle of grace;</HI> and whether this good and pious life, or the faith which is the ba&s;is of it, be the term of ju&s;tification is the inquiry? And the doubt in this age ari&s;es from the mi&s;conception of a controver&s;y in the apo&s;tolic age. We apply what the apo&s;tle &s;pake of the ceremonial temporary law of Mo&s;es, to the eternal laws of moral virtue. It is granted when the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "by the deeds of the law there &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified" that it is equally true in &s;trictne&s;s both of the laws of Mo&s;es and the laws of Je&s;us&mdash;but upon the temporane|ous laws of the former only he had his eye. And when he is on the other hand &s;hewing that the gentiles who had never practi&s;ed the rites of Mo&s;es, might yet be ju&s;tified as
<PB N="22" REF="009018_0021_10306E1CC55AF0F0">
well as the jews, he &s;ays, "We conclude that a man is ju&s;tified by faith without the deeds of the law." The laws of Mo&s;es are exempt in both ca&s;es&mdash;it was ju&s;t a matter of indifference, whether they were jews or gentiles, whether they practiced the law or not&mdash;they were all to be ju&s;tified by faith, and not by the deeds of the law. In truth, I &s;uppo&s;e faith alone is the condition of ju&s;tifica|tion, as good works are of the rewards, but neither meri|torious. The deeds of the law which St. Paul depreciates as of no value, not only in point of ju&s;tification, but in every other &s;en&s;e; and which he counts as dro&s;s and dung, are evidently not that piety and moral virtue which he univer&s;ally inculcates. And as it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the genuinene&s;s of faith but by revelation, or &s;ub&s;equent obe|dience, and revelations have now cea&s;ed;&mdash;&s;o in effect, towards the moral comfort, a con&s;cientious and virtuous life is to be attended to and treated very much as if it was the condition of pardon. And if any tru&s;t to good works for ju&s;tification, in the &s;ame manner as others tru&s;t to faith for ju&s;tification, as a condition only of receiving the atone|ment, it is not e&s;&s;entially erroneous, &s;ince in either ca&s;e the tru&s;t and dependance, with regard to the meritorious cau&s;e, is in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and this only. Did our tru&s;ting to good works or to faith alone lead off our &s;upreme dependence from the &s;acrifice and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t&mdash;&s;hould we in our dependence &s;ub&s;titute either <HI>faith</HI> or <HI>holine&s;s</HI> in the &s;tead of Chri&s;t's atonement; or in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e tru&s;t to the <HI>merit of faith</HI> or <HI>holine&s;s</HI> for <HI>ju&s;tification,</HI> as we all agree to tru&s;t to the merits of Chri&s;t; it would be as e&s;&s;ential a departure from the chri&s;tian method of recovery, as to tru&s;t to jewi&s;h &s;acri|fices, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the law of Mo&s;es. But there are no &s;uch notions or &s;entiments prevailing in this land. Indeed we are a little puzzled about the term and condition <HI>in us</HI> of our being intituled to the atone|ment; but we univer&s;ally depend on the atonement as
<PB N="23" REF="009018_0022_10306E1E76C218D0">
the meritorious foundation of our acceptance and ju&s;tifi|cation. Thus we have con&s;idered the con&s;equences by the grace of God connected with faith in our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The con&s;equences connected with the <HI>principle of vir|tue,</HI> begotten in <HI>regeneration,</HI> are fir&s;t, the &s;ub&s;equent life of virtue, and &s;econdly its rewards. This principle re|&s;embles the moral perfection of the &s;upreme intelligence, and is the ba&s;is of univer&s;al virtue and univer&s;al happine&s;s throughout the moral world. All pure intelligences of every &s;ubordination partake of it in their mea&s;ure, and are actuated by it. When prevalent in man, it as nece&s;&s;arily and naturally influences and impels to a life of holine&s;s, as a polluted principle when prevalent impels to a life of vice. It naturally tends to perpetuate it&s;elf; yet through the embarra&s;&s;ments of a corrupted world, it would decline and come to nothing, if it was not upheld by its divine author. Whence the per&s;everance of &s;aints is not to be a&s;cribed to the indi&s;&s;oluble perpetuity of the principle of grace, but to the promi&s;e and continually &s;u&s;taining power of God. A cour&s;e of holy obedience and heavenly conduct is plea&s;ure|able and delightful, and evidential of the reality of grace in the heart, and the &s;teadine&s;s of our faith:&mdash;this is the pre&s;ent benefit of good works:&mdash;but be&s;ides this, their mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential connections are the <HI>rewards.</HI> The good the gracious principle is not in any mea&s;ure to be rewarded, like the good works it produces. Hence the book of the revela|tion repre&s;ents that at the final adju&s;tment, men are to be rewarded, not according to their faith (this has quite a dif|ferent connexion, viz. ju&s;tification), not according to the principle of grace, but according to the good works which flow from it:&mdash;this not of merit, but of the free, rich and &s;overeign grace of God. In God's admini&s;tration, <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>reward</HI> are not incon&s;i&s;tent. The final rewards of virtue are as much of grace, as the be&s;towment of ju&s;ti|fication on faith, or the giving both faith, repentance, and
<PB N="24" REF="009018_0023_10306E2338B4E050">
regeneration. But though the&s;e rewards are of grace, yet God has been plea&s;ed to inform us that the rule he pre|&s;cribes to him&s;elf, is to apportion them to the degrees of &s;anctity. Thus the whole of our &s;alvation is grace&mdash; <HI>by grace are ye &s;aved, through faith, that not of your&s;elves, it is the gift of God.</HI> Hence,</P>
<P N="7">7. We agree in inculcating and recommending a life of practical religion, a life of pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty, holine&s;s and moral virtue.</P>
<P>We earne&s;tly recommend private &amp; public devotion, fami|ly religion, and pious education of children&mdash;that the light of our good examples may &s;hine around us, and excite others to glorify our heavenly father. We endeavour to cultivate a reverential and undi&s;&s;embled homage of the mo&s;t high, together with unconfined, generous and diffu&s;ive benevo|lence, which &s;hall render this life &s;ocial and plea&s;ant, and qualify us for the future a&s;&s;ociation with the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect. And to animate us to this, we fail not to paint the glories of paradi&s;e and the charms of virtue, and to exhibit &s;uch &s;ublime and exalted views of the moral government of God, as may charm and allure us to that conduct which is the &s;upreme honor of our natures.</P>
<P N="8">8. We further agree, that however impotent and help|le&s;s we are of our&s;elves, yet if any &s;inner, even in an un|regenerate &s;tate, will u&s;e the appointed means of recovery, he may be encouraged to hope for that further aid and &s;uc|ce&s;s which will terminate in his final &s;alvation. Not that the &s;inner can regenerate him&s;elf:&mdash;but in&s;tead of &s;itting down in &s;loth, as if he had nothing to do, no encourage|ment to labor for the meat that endureth to everla&s;ting life, he ought to be up and doing, and work out his &s;alva|tion with fear and trembling, knowing, that on his faithful improvement of the talents and advantages he enjoys, it is God that worketh in him both <HI>to will and to do</HI> of his own good plea&s;ure. He &s;hould u&s;e the appointed means of re|ligious contemplation on his &s;tate, and duly attend to the eternal con&s;equences of moral action, whether virtuous
<PB N="25" REF="009018_0024_10306E2663CAAC88">
or vicious: like a rational and immortal being, he &s;hould deliberate on the tendency, event and i&s;&s;ue of his behaviour. He &s;hould con&s;ider that, by his almighty lawgiver and judge, he is placed on this theatre of action to &s;u&s;tain in the view of mortal and immortal beings a certain character, and that the part he acts has final connexions of the mo&s;t important moment. He &s;hould read the &s;criptures to learn the way of life, the terms of acceptance. He &s;hould not neglect the duty of attending and hearing the word, and above all of humble prayer and &s;upplication to the father of lights, for the illuminations of his holy &s;pirit, to enlighten his mind, that he may clearly di&s;cern tho&s;e rich and attracting di&s;coveries of redeeming love, which may beget faith and renovation of &s;oul. He &s;hould labor for &s;uch ju&s;t and affecting views of the folly of vice, and the excellency and wi&s;dom of virtue, as may terminate in ab|horrence of the one, and a complacency in the other. From the ju&s;t humility and &s;elf-aba&s;ement which attends a thorough conviction of &s;in, there will be an ea&s;y and ir|re&s;i&s;table tran&s;ition to that joyful and unre&s;erved &s;urren|dery of the &s;oul to God, which on our part completes the title to ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>Let no one then be di&s;couraged and &s;ay, that he can|not pray to God acceptably, or a&s;k in &s;incerity. For though the pure and &s;ublime &s;incerity exerci&s;ed by a &s;oul under the full ravi&s;hing di&s;coveries of the go&s;pel, cannot be expected in the unregenerate; yet if ever their prayers are an&s;wered, their imperfect &s;incerity is accepted: and it is evident that they are, becau&s;e with the la&s;t humble a&s;piration of the &s;oul antecedent to conver&s;ion, is connect|ed the imparting regenerating grace. In a word, God would not call upon us indi&s;criminately to a&s;k mercy of him, if he did not indi&s;criminately grant it. The con|nexion between our petitions and the imparting of grace to the unregenerate, no more interferes with the &s;overeign|ty of God, than the connexions of ble&s;&s;ing with the peti|tions

of the godly. All that man receives is free, unme|rited grace. And if the <HI>promi&s;es</HI> are a peculiar favor re&s;erved for the &s;aints; there are <HI>encouragements</HI> however to the unregenerate, to turn from their evil ways and &s;eek God, who giveth grace to the humble. Je&s;us Chri&s;t came to <HI>call &s;inners</HI> to repentance; and with the gracious invitations he makes to them, he &s;ays, <HI>a&s;k and ye &s;hall re|ceive</HI>&mdash; and again, <HI>who&s;oever will let him come:</HI>&mdash; the &s;ealing the vi&s;ion and the prophecy was with an univer&s;al invitation to all freely to come and be happy in paradi&s;e, in that pathetic, earne&s;t and affectionate addre&s;s to mortals, <Q>I Je&s;us have &s;ent mine angel to te&s;tify unto you the&s;e things&mdash;and the &s;pirit and the bride &s;ay, COME.

<P N="10">10. That we agree in the two po&s;itive in&s;titutions of <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> and the <HI>Lord's-Supper.</HI> As to the communion, we do not pro&s;titute it to the vicious and debauched, but re&s;trict it to per&s;ons of &s;obriety, faith and virtue: and for the po&s;ture, according to the example of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, we celebrate it <HI>&s;itting</HI> around the Lord's table. We agree not only in the bapti&s;m of adult believers, but of their infant &s;eed. However incapable they are of in&s;truction and faith, yet Je&s;us Chri&s;t in &s;aying, <HI>of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven,</HI> as we take it, a&s;&s;erts that they are capable of enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of his &s;piritual kingdom&mdash; capable of admi&s;&s;ion into it&mdash;and of con&s;equence capable of the initiatory &s;eal by which all are to be received into his kingdom. They may be intituled to great ble&s;&s;ings, tho' not by their own act, yet by the &s;eal of initiation, by which they are embodied into that catholic community of the virtuous, which having the patronage of Je&s;us will in the i&s;&s;ue appear to be not only the mo&s;t honorable incorpora|tion in this part of the moral world, but to imply intere&s;ts and connexions of great moment. As for the mode of bapti&s;m we univer&s;ally perform it by <HI>affu&s;ion</HI> or &s;prinkling &mdash;but whether it be done thus, or by <HI>immer&s;ion,</HI> we do not hold it e&s;&s;ential. And as the chief difference between the <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> and us is re&s;pecting the &s;ubjects, viz. Infants, on which good and &s;en&s;ible learned men have judged va|riou&s;ly; &s;o there begins to be a good harmony and friend|ly corre&s;pondence between the catholic and charitable of both denominations, which I hope will continue and in|crea&s;e;

<P N="11">11. We agree in the belief of the in&s;piration of the &s;criptures&mdash;we believe that they contain an authentic and the only infallible account of the whole &s;y&s;tem of revela|tion made from Time to Time to mankind&mdash;and that they are a <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> rule of faith and practice. Our churches, God be thanked, are not yet deeply tinged with dei&s;m&mdash; may God pre&s;erve them pure! And as they yet retain the popular belief of revelation, which will abide the mo&s;t &s;e|vere &s;crutiny, &s;o they accept the &s;criptures as an infallible rule. It is indeed a little unhappy, that, like others in the chri&s;tian world, &s;ome of us are fond of &s;ub&s;tituting human interpretations given by authority of councils and learned men, exacting that the &s;acred &s;criptures be under&s;tood ac|cording to &s;en&s;es fitted and defined in human te&s;ts, which all acknowledge to be fallible. But it is to be hoped that we &s;hall &s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith the go&s;pel has made us free. There ought to be no re&s;trictions on the con&s;cience of an hone&s;t and &s;ober believer of revelation. The right of con&s;cience and private judgment is unaliena|ble; and it is truly the intere&s;t of all mankind to unite them&s;elves into one body, for the liberty, free exerci&s;e and unmole&s;ted enjoyment of this right, e&s;pecially in reli|gion. Not all the difference of &s;entiment, not all the er|roneous opinions that have yet been &s;tarted, afford ju&s;t um|brage for its extinction, abridgement or embarra&s;&s;ment. Have the prote&s;tant formularies &s;ub&s;erved the defence of the truth as it is in Je&s;us?&mdash;Rather have they not in event proved new &s;ources of religious di&s;pute and undetermina|ble controver&s;y? The churches of <HI>Geneva</HI> have long &s;ince had the wi&s;dom to drop their article of <HI>con&s;en&s;us,</HI> as the great di&s;turbance of the chri&s;tian harmony.

&s;ub&s;cribo.</HI>&mdash;I am &s;atisfied we &s;hall err le&s;s if we make the &s;criptures the only rule of faith, than if we depart from this, and &s;ub&s;titute another; or as many do, who &s;ay they believe the &s;criptures the <HI>only</HI> rule, and yet in all their judgments on &s;cripture, mea&s;ure that <HI>only</HI> rule by <HI>another</HI> rule. Nor do &s;ub&s;tituted rules an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of detecting heretics at all better than the primary rule, &s;ince on experience it is found none more freely &s;ub&s;cribe and &s;ware to human te&s;ts than dei&s;ts, &s;ceptics and the mo&s;t debauched. If God's inclo&s;ure will not keep out the erroneous, can it be expected that ours will? The uni|ver&s;al pretext is a pre&s;ervation again&s;t here&s;y. But it is to be remarked, that human te&s;ts make more heritics than the word of God&mdash;all that the one determines to be he|re&s;y, is not here&s;y by the &s;criptures. A man may be a very great heretic according to the one, and an excellent chri&s;tian according to the other at the &s;ame time. St. <HI>Paul</HI> was one of the greate&s;t heretics, and even gloried in his here&s;y, and yet was one of the be&s;t of chri&s;tians. The <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> were heretics.

Though we have rea&s;on to be thankful that all the prote&s;tant formularies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harmonia Confe&s;&s;ionum.</NOTE> are &s;o agree|able to &s;cripture as they are; yet they give deci&s;ions on &s;ome things which the &s;cripture has not determined, and on which not only the heterodox, but the mo&s;t orthodox and learned divines have different &s;entiments&mdash; and in other things they are too imperfect to be adopted by chri&s;tians as a &s;tandard and criterion of chri&s;tian truth:

<P N="12">12. Again, We agree in the &s;ufficiency and validity of pre&s;|byterian ordination. This was the ordination practi&s;ed by the apo&s;tles, and among the primitive chri&s;tians of the fir&s;t and &s;econd centuries.&mdash;This is agreeable to &s;cripture:&mdash; was introduced into our churches at the beginning;&mdash;and this has continued our practice ever &s;ince. The <HI>apo&s;tolic</HI> order was appointed in virtue of a &s;upernatural commi&s;&s;ion and di&s;pen&s;ation, which cea&s;ed at the death of St. John. During the&s;e &s;upernatural communications of the holy Gho&s;t, many were divinely, I mean &s;upernaturally, called to the work of the mini&s;try, be&s;ides the apo&s;tles; and were to this end endowed with the gift of tongues and other miraculous powers. As the converts multiplied and formed into religious a&s;&s;emblies or meetings, the holy Gho&s;t appointed over&s;eers and pa&s;tors to in&s;truct and feed the flock of God, to perform bapti&s;ms and admini&s;ter the communion. And the&s;e were indifferently called pre&s;|byters or elders, teachers, bi&s;hops, pa&s;tors. The elders of Ephe&s;us are &s;tiled bi&s;hops, Acts 20.28. So the elders of Philippi are called bi&s;hops, Philip. 1.1. The elders are to take the over&s;ight of the flock, <HI>epi&s;copountes,</HI> doing the work of a bi&s;hop. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the city and church of Ephe&s;us within the fir&s;t three years had &s;undry dioce&s;an bi&s;hops; and yet the apo&s;tle calls the elders of that church bi&s;hops. The&s;e things convince us that &s;cripture bi&s;hops, and elders or pa&s;tors, are of the &s;ame
<PB N="31" REF="009018_0030_10306E35C974AB68">
order and office. Dr. Hammond &s;ays, <Q>there were no presbyters of an Inferior order in&s;tituted by the apo&s;tles.</Q> And the learned Dr. Stillingfleet made this noble con|ce&s;&s;ion <Q>that there were no bi&s;hops during the apo&s;tles life</Q> meaning no dioce&s;an bi&s;hops in the &s;en&s;e of the latin church. We are confirmed in this from con&s;idering what this office was in the &s;ynagogue, from whence it was adopted into the church. The head or pre&s;ident of the &s;ynagogues &s;uperintended the public reading and explica|tions of the law and the prophets, and performed the pub|lic offices of devotion and preaching<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lewis Antiq. Haeb. V. 2. p. 428 and Ba&s;nage.</NOTE>. This officer in the hebrew &s;ynagogues was called <HI>Chazzan;</HI> and in the helleni&s;tic &s;ynagogues <HI>Epi&s;copos,</HI> a <HI>bi&s;hop;</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Sheliach T&s;ibbor, angel of the church,</HI> who never had the charge of more than one congregation, &s;o that there was as many bi&s;hops as &s;ynagogues. In the fir&s;t forming of a &s;ynagogue, the Chazzan was elected by the members, and ordained by the impo&s;ition of hands of the elders of the &s;ynagogue. Afterwards the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion obtained in the appointment of the Chuzan who ordained his &s;ucce&s;&s;or by impo&s;ition of hands, an antient rite of con&s;ecration to a religious office. It does not appear that the Chuzan was ever appointed by the Sanhedrin. Nor does it appear that the &s;ynagogues or their officers were of divine appoint|ment: &s;ince the oracular re&s;pon&s;es of Urim and Thum|mim, and the other &s;upernatural communications cea&s;ed before their in&s;titution. The ceremonies of <HI>anointing</HI> and <HI>impo&s;ition of hands</HI> originally implied an authorative de&s;ig|nation from heaven. The tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> was con&s;ecrated to the levitical office, and the family of <HI>Aaron</HI> to the prie&s;tly office by <HI>impo&s;ition of hands,</HI> implying an autho|ratitive de&s;ignation from heaven. <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>David</HI> were de&s;ignated to the regal office by the ceremony of <HI>anoint|ing with Oyl. Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> were &s;eparated to the apo&s;tolic office by <HI>prayer and the impo&s;ition of hands.</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="009018_0031_10306E3C934DF0B8">
The&s;e were &s;upernatural de&s;ignations, and clothed the re&s;pective officers with a proper divine authority. And the&s;e rites of initiation into the real and pa&s;toral office were retained, and probably were &s;et forth as examples, and intended by God to be retained in the kingdoms and churches of &s;ucceeding ages, when the authorative de&s;ig|nation was left to men. The apo&s;tles took early care to furni&s;h examples for perpetual imitation in the churches, by leaving the de&s;ignation of the pa&s;tors to the free elec|tion of the churches&mdash;u&s;ing the &s;ame rites in &s;etting apart tho&s;e appointed by the churches, as in con&s;ecrating tho&s;e that were &s;upernaturally called and appointed by heaven. There is a great difference between imitating the antient divine appointments, and acting under a direct divine ap|pointment. Samuel and the prophets anointed kings jure divino: but we do not now imagine that when a bi&s;hop anoints a king in the&s;e ages, that he does it jure divino, or confers any divine authority on the regal character. It is but <HI>imitative</HI> of the few in&s;tances of extraordinary regal appointment in the jewi&s;h monarchy. So the impo&s;ition of hands in the ordination of pa&s;tors, which is held <HI>in|different</HI> in &s;everal reformed churches, implies no &s;uper|natural appointment to the pa&s;toral office; and is in like manner <HI>imitative</HI> only of the antient ceremonies of con|&s;ecration, and the few in&s;tances of extraordinary appoint|ment in the apo&s;tolic age, and at the fir&s;t &s;etting up of chri&s;|tianity. The period of extraordinary appointment to the regal office was at mo&s;t from Samuel to the di&s;&s;olution of the hebrew monarchies in their re&s;pective captivities. The period for like appointment of the pa&s;tors is limited to the few in&s;tances of the fir&s;t century, or at mo&s;t to the period of miraculous powers. Since the&s;e periods both have been <HI>imitative only.</HI></P>
<P>The ceremony of pa&s;toral inve&s;titure was from the beginning performed by co-ordinate presbyters or pa&s;tors; with whom the apo&s;tles left the conferring holy orders in

all the &s;ucceeding ages of the church. Thus pure and uncorrupted antiquity is on the &s;ide of ordination by co|equal presbyters. <HI>Clemens Romanus</HI> and <HI>Polycarp</HI> &s;peak of bi&s;hops and elders as of the &s;ame order and office. <HI>Je|rome</HI> and <HI>Hilary</HI> are on our &s;ide, by the con&s;ent of all who are acquainted with eccle&s;ia&s;tical antiquity.

And the antiquity and figure of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, which ob|tained for ages throughout the chri&s;tian church, would have been an argument invincible, were it not for the total &s;ilence of SCRIPTURE, and the certainty that the &s;cripture ordina|tions were performed by presbyters, and its making no difference between the of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s and powers of bi&s;hops and elders.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bp.

The elders who laboured in word and doctrine, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the ordina|tion of pa&s;tors in other churches be&s;ides their own.

Thus the original epi&s;copacy was the pa&s;torate of a &s;ingle congregation. The hierarchy of the greek and latin churches after the apo&s;tolic age re&s;olved the body of eccle&s;ia&s;tics into &s;ubordinations unknown to the apo&s;tles, who left but one order of in&s;tructors, that of elders, with power to perpetuate them&s;elves in the election of the people to the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>At the reformation it was &s;o generally conceded that presbyterian ordination was the original practice, that it had univer&s;ally obtained but for the <HI>dignities</HI> and <HI>revenues.</HI> As much as this, on the part of England, is implied in the rea&s;onings of Dr. MADDOX the late b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Worce&s;ter:&mdash; upon who&s;e rea&s;onings a parliamentar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>presbytery,</HI> in the reign of Q.

Nor do we ever find the apo&s;tles or neighbouring pa&s;tors ever negatived a popular election; but univer&s;ally ordained &s;uch men to the mini&s;try as by the choice of the congregation appeared to be men of <HI>good report.</HI> So the churches of New-England chu&s;e their own pa&s;tors, who are ordained or con&s;ecrated&punc; as <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, "with the common con&s;ent of the bi&s;hops of the vicinity."

<P>When it is &s;aid, Acts xiv. 23, <HI>they ordained them elders in every church,</HI> it is evident from the known cu&s;tom of the <HI>Keirotonia,</HI> in the athenian democracy, that it ought to be rendered to this effect, <HI>leading the people to the choice of elders in every church, by the lifting up of hands.</HI> The apo&s;tles, in the opinion of Dr. Cotton Mather, only pre|&s;ided, and the people under their in&s;pection elected. This <HI>Keiretonia</HI> is the practice of our churches. The ceremo|ny of con&s;ecration was the impo&s;ition of hands with pray|er.

<P>The original cu&s;tom &s;ettled by the apo&s;tles, was not worn out in &s;everal centuries: Ignatius writing to the church in Philadelphia, tells them, that it belonged to them to chu&s;e their pa&s;tor.

Even in <HI>Rome</HI> it&s;elf, the people elected their bi&s;hop till the XIIth century. And popular elec|tions of mini&s;ters continued 'till <HI>Charlemagne.</HI> Before this time indeed the privilege was in a great mea&s;ure de|forced from &s;ome churches. For after the miraculous powers, the clergy encroached on this principle, e&s;pecially as the benefices became oppulent. But they did not com|plete the acqui&s;ition, 'till that immen&s;e wealth, which they intrigued into their hands in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, gave them a weight which could no longer be re&s;i&s;ted. This &s;acerdotal a&s;cendency, and irre&s;i&s;tible influence, commen|ced from &s;mall beginnings and gentle encroachments. From &s;uch &s;mall beginnings, as recommending the advice of neighbouring pa&s;tors in the choice of a mini&s;ter; they proceeded, as this cu&s;tom obtained, to <HI>claim</HI> and <HI>demand</HI> &s;uch application for advice, as a pa&s;toral right; and from claim|ing it as a right, advanced to hold a negative on the electi|ons of neighbouring churches; and afterwards in the light of councils, which have proved the grand fources of cor|ruption and tyranny, they beheld it for the public good and con&s;ervation of the faith, that they &s;hould be ve&s;ted with the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al of pa&s;toral vacancies. In the &s;ub|&s;equent ages of the church, tho&s;e who founded the reve|nues, whether &s;tates or private per&s;ons, affirmed a temporary right of nomination or pre&s;entation to benefices. But the
<PB N="40" REF="009018_0039_10306E5473869CE0">
clergy piou&s;ly prevailed on the founders to de&s;ignate this power to them in their la&s;t wills. Thus and by mortmains which they devoutly procured in beque&s;ts and pious u&s;es, &s;ubjected to the direction and di&s;po&s;al of the religious, they had intrigued <HI>two thirds</HI> of the property of &s;outhern and we&s;tern Europe into their holy hands. Thus by the XIVth century the european churches not only lo&s;t the liberty of pa&s;toral elections, but with it &s;tupidly played away their property, and &s;ubjugated them&s;elves, their &s;ouls, bodies, and e&s;tates, to a plau&s;ibly u&s;urped, becau&s;e &s;piritual domi|nion. Thus the churches at length lo&s;t the invaluable power of pa&s;toral election, which they have never been able to recover. This &s;hews how dangerous a thing it is to &s;urrender liberty! In the reformation, the clergy them|&s;elves lo&s;t that power which they had piou&s;ly intrigued from the people in the four preceeding centuries. For upon &s;ecularizing the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, the prote&s;tant princes, nobility and oppulent founders, making appropri|ations for the &s;upport of the clergy, deemed it wi&s;dom to a&s;&s;ume the pre&s;entations into &s;ecular hands. And the no|mination is now mo&s;t generally in patronages in all the pro|te&s;tant churches. Thus the power which the clergy in a long &s;truggle caught from the people, is at length lodged not in the people, not in the clergy, but in &s;ecular patrons.</P>
<P>The brethren and congregation have <HI>lo&s;t their liberty,</HI> when the appointment or nomination of a pa&s;tor is re&s;ted, 1. In the &s;overeignty, whether it re&s;ide in a prince or a &s;tate. Thus the &s;tates of <HI>Holland,</HI> and the kings of <HI>Sar|dinia</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> have the exclu&s;ive nomination to pa&s;toral vacancies. 2. When it is in a presbytery, con&s;i&s;tory or con&s;ociation.

Vol. 1. p. 103.</NOTE></Q> 4. When it is in patronages, whether the patrons be princes, nobi|lity, bi&s;hops and dignified clergy, pious benefactors, or provincial governors. One or other of the&s;e have the advow&s;on of by far the greater part of epi&s;copal livings in the briti&s;h empire, and throughout the prote&s;tant world. The royal <HI>conge de lire</HI> &s;o re&s;tricts the election of the briti&s;h bi&s;hops, as that their appointment may be &s;aid to be in the crown. The epi&s;copal livings in the province of <HI>Maryland</HI> are in the gift of the proprietary governor, who has the appointment and induction of all the clergy of the province. I am told that the collation to all epi&s;|copal benefices in the plantations, excepting the mi&s;&s;ions, is in the King's governors. In <HI>Demnark</HI> the power ex|clu&s;ive is in the prince, nobility and other patrons. Pa|tronages are al&s;o numerous in the church of Scotland. All the&s;e are total deprivations of choice in the people: in &s;ome in&s;tances they may perhaps be con&s;ulted, but have no <HI>determining voice,</HI> and in point of power this is to have ju&s;t nothing.</P>
<P>The powers of the brethren, on the ca&s;e before us, are <HI>abridged and embarra&s;&s;ed,</HI> and their liberty but partial. 1. When in virtue of a public compact e&s;tabli&s;hed among a body of churches, the churches of the vici|nity have a negative on a pa&s;toral choice of a de&s;ti|tute
<PB N="42" REF="009018_0041_10306E581CFBE048">
congregation. Or 2. When in virtue of &s;uch agreement the mini&s;ters of the vicinity are inve&s;ted with &s;uch a negative. So that there being two voices in the election&mdash;the vacant congregation have one, and the neigh|boring pa&s;tors another. I do not know that this is the ca&s;e in any part of the world. No one can di&s;pute but that an eccle&s;ia&s;tical community or combination of churches can form &s;uch a re&s;olve and enforce it, tho' not in virtue of any divine power: yet the wi&s;dom of &s;uch a mea&s;ure may be que&s;tioned. 3. When the advow&s;on or choice is in a ve&s;try and church wardens, or committee cho&s;en by the congregation&mdash;as in rectori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. This is a low &s;pecies of liberty, and a re&s;triction that almo&s;t amounts to depri|vation. But in truth the lowe&s;t &s;pecies of real genuine liberty is, when there is at lea&s;t a negative in the congre|gation, as well as in a patron or presbytery, or tho&s;e who &s;hare part of the liberty. If there is a negative only in the latter, even the indulgence of choice in the church is no real true liberty. Again, 4. When among a body of <HI>free</HI> apo&s;tolic churches, a number of neighbouring church|es take upon them&s;elves to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the acts and election of a &s;i&s;ter church, and excommunicate or refu&s;e chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip with that church&mdash;if this &s;hould not in the event controle the election &amp; introduce a negative on the church, yet it certainly has a tendency to it; and at lea&s;t &s;hews, that that combination of churches are de&s;irous of &s;piritual dominion, and would if they had power introduce them&s;elves to &s;uch a negative. All pretexts are foreign; the que&s;tion is &s;olely upon the point of <HI>power</HI>&mdash;whether it is &s;olely in the church? or whether it &s;hall be &s;hared with the churches of the vicinity? And &s;uch a practice is defen&s;ible only upon this principle, that it is be&s;t for the whole body of churches to have this mutual reciprocal controll upon one another. Aad this principal is a fun|damental &s;ubver&s;ion of congregationali&s;m. For if the transferring the whole power of electing a pa&s;tor to the
<PB N="43" REF="009018_0042_10306E5B1C27D708">
churches of the vicinity, would be a total deprivation of power in the particular church; then the transferring half that power, would be a partial a &s;emi-deprivation. And if upon &s;uch a &s;urrendery, in a vicinity of 20 con&s;o|ciated churches, the con&s;ent of 10 be&s;ides the vacant church be nece&s;&s;ary, that church retains but one tenth of her power, and has given up and lo&s;t nine tenths. Thus the introducing the con&s;ociation to a negative on pa&s;toral elections; is an <HI>abridgment and embarra&s;&s;ment,</HI> nearly a|mounting to a total deprivation of power in particular churches and congregations: and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on&s;equently a funda|mental &s;ubver&s;ion of congregationali&s;m, according to which every congregation is ve&s;ted not with partial but plenary deci&s;ive power.</P>
<P>Churches can then alone be &s;aid to be <HI>perfectly free,</HI> when each congregation has an <HI>unlimited, ab&s;olute</HI> and <HI>&s;elf-determining</HI> power in the choice of their officers:&mdash; &s;uch as briti&s;h freemen enjoy and exerci&s;e uncontroulably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the choice of a repre&s;entative or member of a&s;&s;embly.

<P>Our churches acknowledge no juri&s;diction of &s;i&s;ter churches over them; but hold them&s;elves both capable, and to have power to determine all matters of difference that ari&s;e in a particular church. For in truth, in religion we ought all to be free; and con&s;equently not the religious &s;peculative opinions of a chri&s;tian, one that hone&s;tly believes revelation, ought to be deemed the &s;ubject of eccle&s;ia&s;tical animadver&s;ion in a church, and little el&s;e be&s;ides his mo|rals. And this every church is a complete judge of, and perhaps is &s;eldom mi&s;taken. And if we go beyond this, neither &s;ingle churches, nor a body, nor oecumenical coun|cils can determine: as is evident from an experiment thro' the long tract of time from the council of <HI>Nice</HI> to that of <HI>Trent.</HI> It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed indeed, that our churches have &s;ometimes taken on them the deci&s;ion of matters, which all the power and wi&s;dom on earth cannot determine till the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t. But whatever is within the capacity of mortals to determine, re&s;pecting the chri&s;tian di&s;cipline, the brethren are &s;ufficient judges of.
<PB N="46" REF="009018_0045_10306E64A1012478">
Or if they may &s;ometimes be at a lo&s;s, they have recour&s;e to the opinion and advice of &s;uch council as they think fit to con&s;ult, re&s;erving to them&s;elves a liberty to receive or refu&s;e &s;uch advice when given. And with this a&s;&s;i&s;tance they can determine any thing and every thing that can be determined by mortals&mdash;whether they confine them&s;elves to what properly belongs to them; or whether they en|large into things which God perhaps has nor determined for us, and never intended mortals &s;hould determine for one another. And with regard to the&s;e la&s;t, the church, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of council, can re&s;olve and decide ju&s;t as wi&s;ely as the wi&s;e&s;t body of men, and &s;ave to them&s;elves the power of deciding the le&s;&s;er and yet more momentous differences which are truly the &s;ubjects of their deci&s;ion. Therefore though our churches, in forming their deci&s;ions in matters of di&s;cipline, make application to a council of the pa&s;tors and me&s;&s;engers of neighbouring churches; yet the congregational churches univer&s;ally hold a negative on the re&s;ult of that council&mdash;or rather the deci&s;ion of &s;uch council is of no force till received and ratified by the in|viting church: nor does it render that church obnoxious to the vicinity, if &s;he recedes from the opinion of the council. So that congregational councils are <HI>advi&s;ory</HI> only. And in this manner have &s;ub&s;erved valuable purpo&s;es, not &s;o much by affording any new light, as by becoming peace|makers in their connexions, influence and per&s;ua&s;ions. Thus our churches are ab&s;olutely free with re&s;pect to all foreign juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>There was indeed in the year 1705, an attempt or pro|po&s;al to &s;ubordinate the whole body of our churches to the juri&s;diction of con&s;ociation, with final appeal to a gene|ral provincial con&s;ociation, in which all controver&s;ies were to take an ultimate i&s;&s;ue and deci&s;ion. But the&s;e propo&s;als met with in&s;uperable oppo&s;ition, from the &s;pirit of liberty. Dr. Cotton Mather &s;peaking of them &s;ays, "there were &s;ome very con&s;iderable per&s;ons among the <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> as well

And there is no rea&s;on to think this gen|tleman was an enemy to our churches.&mdash;It was early &s;een to be important, that our churches &s;hould be <HI>con&s;ociated;</HI> but whether for the purpo&s;es of <HI>harmony</HI> only, or <HI>dominion,</HI> was as early the que&s;tion. For it was &s;een that whatever power was ceded to the &s;tanding council, ju&s;t &s;o much was taken away from particular churches; and this cla&s;hed with the principle, that every church had power to decide its own controver&s;ies. The conte&s;ting this claim, and op|po&s;ing the transferring of &s;piritual dominion from the church to a &s;tanding council, is the true rea&s;on, as I apprehend, that all our congregational churches in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire, are not re&s;olved into con&s;ociations; which tho' not <HI>jure divino,</HI> are however excellent things. But to &s;hew that the congregational churches are under no fore|ign juri&s;diction of other churches a&s;&s;embled in &s;tanding or occa&s;ional councils, we may recur to the an&s;wer given by our churches a&s;&s;embled in Synod, A.

<P N="2">II.

<P N="1">1. One &s;ource of different &s;entiment, were the unhappy exce&s;&s;es into which our churches have been tran&s;ported in the late enthu&s;ia&s;m that prevailed &s;ince the year 1740. In the public mi&s;taken zeal, religion was made to con&s;i&s;t in extravagancies and indecencies, which were not according to the faith once delivered. Multitudes were &s;eriou&s;ly, &s;oberly and &s;olemnly out of their wits. The &s;criptures were in danger of being neglected for the indi&s;tingui&s;hable impul&s;es of the &s;pirit of God; &s;ober rea&s;on gave way to enthu&s;ia&s;m; the terrors of eternal damnation, in&s;tead of &s;ub&s;erving rational and &s;ober convictions, were improved to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow people into that confu&s;ion, frenzy and di&s;traction, which anfitted them for the genial illuminations of the holy &s;pirit. Be&s;ides this, the &s;tanding mini&s;try were a&s;per&s;ed, and repre&s;ented under abu&s;ive &s;u&s;picions of being unconverted, legali&s;ts, arminians. And as they were thus publicly and indecently vilified, &s;o it was taught as a duty to for&s;ake their mini&s;trations, and form into &s;eparate a&s;&s;em|blies. And as was natural to expect, our churches were hereby rent and torn and thrown into convul&s;ions and con|fu&s;ions, to the great di&s;honor of the general cau&s;e. Much
<PB N="51" REF="009018_0050_10306E72E1D4C440">
of this indeed was piou&s;ly meant, and hone&s;tly intended&punc; and proceded from a zeal for the cau&s;e of God. Thus there was no doubt an intermixture of good, and it is to be hoped many were &s;avingly converted. Our churches have now in &s;ome mea&s;ure cooled and recovered them&s;elves, tho' the &s;pirit of enthu&s;ia&s;m is not altogether extingui&s;hed as yet, but operates and influences under different pretexts, and in a different form. But it is to be remarked with gratitude to the over-ruling di&s;po&s;er of events, that amid&s;t the religious convul&s;ions which threatned the &s;ubver&s;ion of congregationali&s;m, an augmentation of above 150 new churches has taken place in that period, founded not on the &s;eparations, but natural increa&s;e into new towns and pari&s;hes. The&s;e differences into which good and pious men were involved, have indeed made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion, as not to be ea&s;ily effaced in the pre&s;ent generation, not|with&s;tanding it is &s;o much our intere&s;t to unite in love and harmony; nor can we &s;o ea&s;ily, heartily and &s;incerely unite as if nothing of this nature had happened to di&s;turb the common benevolence. But it is to be hoped that the &s;pirit of alienation will more and more &s;ub&s;ide, and not be tran&s;mitted to &s;ucceeding generations. On all &s;ides there have doubtle&s;s been errors and indi&s;cretions, let us put on conde&s;cention and charity; and nobly forgive one another.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another &s;ource of differences is that of <HI>calvini&s;m</HI> and <HI>arminiani&s;m.</HI> Many great and pious men are alarmed at a &s;uppo&s;ed prevalence of arminian principles through the churches of New-England: and others &s;uppo&s;e calvini&s;m greatly erroneous. Under the&s;e banners they re&s;pectively enli&s;t, combat, conquer, and are conquered. The pretext of the&s;e names &s;erves to legitimate mutual a&s;per&s;ions which neither party de&s;erve. To me it appears that the&s;e jea|lou&s;ies are founded almo&s;t intirely on mi&s;take: nor am I aware of any very e&s;&s;ential or general alteration of the public &s;entiment on what we all agree to be the fundamen|tal principles of revelation.

with the mini&s;ters of New-England, I cannot perceive any very e&s;&s;ential real difference in their opinions re&s;pecting the fundamental principles of religion. I may be mi&s;taken&mdash;but their different manner and phra&s;eology in explaining the &s;ame principles appears to me to be their chief difference.

And yet none that I ever conver&s;ed with who are called calvini&s;ts, by any means admit the&s;e con&s;equences from their principles.

obedience in&s;tead of the obedience of Chri&s;t, for the ba&s;is and meritorious foundation of ju&s;tification&mdash;in a word, that their notions and &s;entiments imply that man is not totally depraved, and tho' fallen, yet by Chri&s;t recovered to even a better &s;tate at pre&s;ent than Adam in innocency was in; and that there is no need of atonement, renovation of na|ture, or of the &s;pirit's operation. But all reputed arminians I have conver&s;ed with &s;trenuou&s;ly deny the&s;e con&s;equences. And I find both reputed calvini&s;ts and arminians, e&s;peci|ally of the clergy, agree in admitting the depravity of human nature in all its powers and affections&mdash;the ab&s;o|lute inability to faith and holine&s;s, without the &s;pecial in|fluences, a&s;&s;i&s;tances and operations of the &s;pirit on the hu|man mind, over and above the elucidated and in&s;pired di&s;|coveries of revelation, I do not mean to reveal new truths, but to enable us to an efficacious apprehen&s;ion and di&s;|cernment of tho&s;e already revealed&mdash;that to his enlight|ning energies is to be attributed the principle of <HI>regenera|tion</HI>&mdash;that we are <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> in the &s;ight of God, not for good works, but alone for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t and his atonement: tho' they may differ in defining the nature of atonement, yet all agree in making it the &s;ole foundation of ju&s;tification&mdash;that the benefits of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s are appropriated to believers by <HI>faith,</HI> as the condition of our receiving the atonement.</P>

<P>On finding this great agreement, &s;amene&s;s and real harmony of &s;entiment, among gentlemen reputed e&s;&s;en|tially to differ, I have often wondered whence could ari&s;e &s;uch different reputations. And without charging it to the account of art and policy to a&s;per&s;e one another's charact|ers, I have been charitably obliged to conceive this &s;uppo|&s;ititious difference very like to that which aro&s;e on the <HI>co|venant of works</HI> and the <HI>covenant of grace,</HI> and produced a memorable convul&s;ion in our churches in their infancy about 123 years ago: of which Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> has given us an account in his magnalia; where may be &s;een how the great Mr. COTTON was a&s;per&s;ed and encompa&s;&s;ed with the public jealou&s;y.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cotton's An&s;. to Mr. Williams, p. 50.</NOTE> Jealou&s;ies were rai&s;ed between the be&s;t of divines and the be&s;t of chri&s;tians. It is remarkable how e&s;&s;entially they tho't them&s;elves to differ, and thought the difference even damnable too. Mutual eccle&s;ia&s;tical anathemas were denounced, civil di&s;cord en&s;ued, till a di&s;honorable per&s;ecution &s;atiated the public &s;pirit, and pre|pared the churches for the cool retro&s;pect of 50 years, when they found the whole was &s;urmi&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ition and mi&s;take. Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> freely declares it his opinion, that the mini&s;ters of that day all very nearly agreed in &s;entiment with Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> at the &s;ame time, re&s;pecting tho&s;e very points on which they unhappily tho't them|&s;elves to differ&mdash;and that their jealou&s;ies all proceded from mutual concern for the welfare of the churches, which led them to &s;u&s;pect and be alarmed at every thing that had

the a&s;pect of tendency to their hurt. Po&s;terity may make the &s;ame judgment concerning us.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are unaccountable in human nature&mdash;but have been facts in pa&s;t ages&mdash;may be &s;o in the pre&s;ent. The only way is to examine our &s;entiments by &s;cripture; then candidly and benevolently inquire how far we are agreed in reality; to walk together by the &s;ame amiable rule &s;o far as we have attained to think alike; and to for|bear real differences in love, where there appears a &s;incere love of truth, candor and piety. Remembering we all have the unalienable right of private judgment in religion; and that liberty of thinking and chu&s;ing our religion, <HI>liberty of con&s;cience</HI> was the great errand of our pious fore|fathers into America. And as to real differences, I believe we might amicably adju&s;t them by honorable and benevo|lent conce&s;&s;ions, by &s;tudying and comparing the written word which we all agree to be a &s;ufficient rule, in&s;tead of human &s;y&s;tems on which we all ju&s;tly differ. In the &s;earch after truth it &s;hould be our perpetual motto, <HI>"nul|lius addictus jurare in verba magi&s;tri."</HI> For after all, the que&s;tion ought not to be what is <HI>calvini&s;m,</HI> or what <HI>armi|niani&s;m?</HI>&mdash;what was the opinion of <HI>calvin,</HI> or what the opinion of <HI>arminius?</HI> but what is real chri&s;tianity? what is the truth as Je&s;us and his in&s;pired apo&s;tles delivered it?</P>

<P>In the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this country our churches were free, independent and un&s;ubordinate to one another. But though it was an agreed point that each church had of it&s;elf plenary power in deciding all its controver&s;ies, and i&s;&s;uing

all matters of di&s;cipline: yet they al&s;o agreed in con&s;ulting and advi&s;ing with the churches of the vicinity, repre&s;ented and a&s;&s;embled in council on application of the con&s;ulting church. The advi&s;ory re&s;ults of which councils had, as they ju&s;tly ought to have, con&s;iderable weight in healing differences. In time it became the opinion of many of the clergy, that it was be&s;t for the con&s;ervation of the faith and public order, that the advi&s;ory influence of councils &s;hould be extended into juridical authority. There have been formed two <HI>platforms</HI> for church di&s;cipline and poli|cy:&mdash;one in 1647, before the notions of increa&s;ing or in|deed of giving any authority at all to councils began; the other not 'till 1708, when they run high. The fir&s;t was made at a general &s;ynod a&s;&s;embled at Cambridge, con&s;i&s;ting of the pa&s;tors and me&s;&s;engers of &s;everal churches. The latter at a &s;ynod con&s;i&s;ting of the pa&s;tors and me&s;&s;engers a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Saybrook,</HI> previou&s;ly elected and delegated from the four county conventions of the churches of Con|necticut. After the&s;e platforms were made, they were tran&s;mitted to the churches for their approbation. Tho&s;e of Connecticut, except perhaps 14 or 15 churches, have acced|ed at length to the Say-brook agreement: in what &s;en&s;e, with re&s;pect to the authority of councils, we &s;hall afterwards in|quire. The re&s;t of the congregational churches in New-England generally regulate them&s;elves on this point, ac|cording to the congregational platform, which is commonly called the congregational platform, or rather on the purely &s;criptural model. Now the difference of &s;entiments re&s;|pecting the authority of councils, is almo&s;t intirely founded on &s;ome very &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions in both platforms, re&s;pect|ing the powers and independency of di&s;tinct un&s;ubordinate churches; and other &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially in the Say-brook platform, importing the &s;ubjugation of our chur|ches to the final juri&s;diction and authority of councils. It may facilitate our under&s;tanding this matter, as well as the eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity of our churches in general, to con&s;ider

the &s;entiments of the compilers of the&s;e platforms, the public &s;pirit of liberty at the times of their re&s;pective for|mation, and the &s;en&s;e in which they were received by the &s;mall body of churches at fir&s;t, and la&s;tly the &s;en&s;e in which they are received and adopted by the pre&s;ent large body of churches; mo&s;t of which have been gathered &s;ince the&s;e regulations and agreements of our ance&s;tors. But before I proceed, let me ju&s;t ob&s;erve that our eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity, at lea&s;t &s;o far as relates to councils, whatever it is, like the polities and &s;ocial confederacies of all other prote&s;tant churches, takes origin and is founded in <HI>human</HI> wi&s;dom, human agreement and confederacy, having no claim to <HI>divine</HI> authority. It is only a wi&s;e mea&s;ure which the churches accede to for harmony, fellow&s;hip and union. Antecedent to which agreement and confederacy the churches were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n full life, in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all eccle|&s;ia&s;tical power: and if they have imparted or delegated all or part of this power to councils, the councils received ju&s;t &s;o much as the churches covenanted to impart and no more:&mdash;which the &s;ucceding acts of the churches may re&s;ume, limit or continue.</P>
<P>In order to enter into the &s;pirit of the <HI>congregational</HI> platform which we are fir&s;t to con&s;ider, it may be ob&s;erved what is well known, that the fir&s;t mini&s;ters and churches were partly <HI>presbyterian,</HI> partly <HI>congregational</HI>&mdash;both <HI>in|dependent.</HI> There &s;eem to have been three opinions a|mong the mini&s;ters. Three or four were for having the whole rule transferred and ceded from the fraternity to a &s;tanding elder&s;hip; the authorative act and concurrence of the brethren to be taken in no ca&s;es but the choice of elders, and in ratifying the &s;entence of excommunication. But of this opinion the churches could never be per&s;uaded. Mo&s;t of the mini&s;ters were for an elder&s;hip elected by the fraternity, with a negative on the church; and &s;o all church acts to procede on the concurrence of the elder|&s;hip and brethren in a mixt admini&s;tration. Some few

churches acceded to this: and this is the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e in which presbyteriani&s;m ever obtained among our churches. Others of the pa&s;tors agreed with the almo&s;t univer&s;al &s;en&s;e of the brethren in the true and proper unmixt idea of a congregational church, viz. that all di&s;ciplinary power ve&s;ted in the fraternity. All agreed in receiving the &s;crip|tures as their only rule in religion:&mdash;all very much agreed in their interpretation of the doctrinal parts of &s;cripture: &mdash;differing in their notions of di&s;cipline in little more than this, viz. that <HI>power of the keys,</HI> which the <HI>presby|terians</HI> would have ve&s;ted in the elder&s;hip, the <HI>congrega|tionali&s;ts</HI> would have to ve&s;t and re&s;ide in the body of the fraternity. Both agreed in the independency of each church. Nor were the presbyterians i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">clined to the mode of the Scotti&s;h or Holland cla&s;&s;ical presbytery. While they were for the exclu&s;ive power of elders in admi&s;&s;ions to communion and di&s;ciplinary acts, that is for the autho|rity of presbytery in a particular church; they agreed in di&s;claiming the authority of a presbytery out of the church, that is the juri&s;diction of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical presbyteries of the vicinity. The congregationali&s;ts retained all the pow|er in the hands of the brethren conjunctly. Both agreed that the power of the keys was in the church, whether exerci&s;ed by the elders alone, or by the whole church. This is a fundamental principle from which the churches never &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves to have departed. On the&s;e general principles the plan of union or confederacy was conceived by the &s;ynod, A. D. 1646. a&s;&s;embled on the recommendation of the legi&s;lature of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. The &s;ynod thereupon appointed two gentlemen of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, and one of the colony of Plymouth, to draught each of them a model of di&s;cipline and polity for the choice of the &s;ucceding &s;e&s;&s;ion. The compilers were the reverend me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>John Cotton</HI> of Bo&s;ton, <HI>Richard Ma|ther</HI> of Dorche&s;ter, and <HI>Ralph Partridge</HI> of Duxbury. Mr. <HI>Mather</HI>'s model is &s;aid to have been cho&s;en. Mr.

<HI>Norton</HI> revi&s;ed it, and with &s;uch further amendments as the &s;ynod thought proper, it was fini&s;hed. Now the &s;entiments of the&s;e gentlemen are well known to have been presbyterian in the &s;econd &s;en&s;e above defined. I imagine they were nearly in the &s;ame &s;entiments: unle&s;s perhaps Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI>'s notions of the authority and juri&s;|diction of councils might be lower than the others, as that pious and learned man had &s;u&s;tained an implied or oblique animadver&s;ion in the &s;ynod of 1637. So far as I can learn, their notions of eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity were thus, that every church &s;hould be furni&s;hed with a presbytery con&s;i&s;ting of a <HI>pa&s;tor, teacher</HI> and one or more <HI>ruling elders,</HI> all elected by the church, in who&s;e hands &s;hould be the di&s;cipline and governing, as well as in&s;truction of the con|gregation. That in matters of difficulty this presbytery might advi&s;e with a council con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch a number of the triumvirate elder&s;hips in the vicinity or el&s;ewhere, as they &s;hould invite to a&s;&s;emble. That the churches properly congregational, and which had no triumvirate, &s;hould in&s;tead of an elder&s;hip appear in council by their pa&s;tors and me&s;&s;engers, as they had done in the &s;ynods of 1637 and 1646. That the pa&s;tors, elders and me&s;&s;engers a&s;&s;emble in council in the capacity of delegates from the churches&mdash;and as <HI>pares</HI> or equals in council:&mdash;not that an occa&s;ional council or oecumenical &s;ynod &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of two e&s;tates, the clergy for one, and the lay-delegates for another; and &s;o have di&s;tinct acts, as in the upper and lower hou&s;es of convocation. That as an oecumenical council might a&s;&s;emble at the invitation of the legi&s;lature; &s;o an occa&s;ional council might be a&s;&s;embled on the invita|tion of the church when a difficulty &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, not autho|ritatively to decide and determine the difficulty, but to ad|vi&s;e the church how to decide and determine it. That they &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled only on &s;uch occa&s;ions as the par|ticular church thought proper, and con&s;ider &s;uch matters only as the church laid before them, &amp; would be advi&s;ed in.

That the a&s;&s;emblings of provincial &s;ynods and of ordinary councils, be neither of them &s;tated, but both pro re nata occa&s;ional.</P>
<P>It is well known, as I have &s;aid, that however fond our fathers in the mini&s;try were of the power of presbyteries in churches, and of the advice of councils, they were how|ever very oppo&s;ite to the powers of councils, cla&s;&s;es or &s;ynods out of the church. In oppo&s;ition to this extraneous foreign juri&s;diction, many of them wrote largely, particu|larly the reverend Mr. <HI>Cotton:</HI> &s;o al&s;o the rev. Mr. <HI>Da|venport</HI> in his an&s;wer to the rev. Mr. <HI>Paget</HI> of <HI>Holland:</HI> &s;o al&s;o the rev. Mr. Richard Mather, one of the com|pilers of the platform wrote again&s;t Mr. <HI>Herle</HI> in 1644. in confutation of Mr. <HI>Herle</HI>'s <Q>four arguments for the government of &s;ynods over particular congregations.</Q> Hence the&s;e gentlemen were intirely again&s;t the deci&s;ive authority of councils and &s;ynods when a&s;&s;embled: or that they &s;hould be ve&s;ted with power to enforce their decrees with a penalty of non-communion to be declared by them|&s;elves authoritatively as a council or &s;ynod. They would have them <HI>advi&s;ory</HI> only, to give their opinion and advi&s;e on difficult ca&s;es, as readers of divinity in the univer&s;ity, or men learned in the u&s;ages and cu&s;toms of the churches. They were to the churches, if I may borrow an illu&s;tra|tion from high example, what the privy council are to the king. On the matters laid before them they draw up their judgment and re&s;ult, which is remitted to the church, &mdash;if the church received it, it had force; not through the authority of the council or of the churches repre&s;ent|ed in council, but of the church which receives and con|firms it, and which has a plenary power of governing it&s;elf, and deciding all its controver&s;ies.

<P><PB N="64" REF="009018_0063_10306EA5580231C8">The &s;pirit of liberty at this time in the <HI>churches</HI> was &s;uch, that they were on the &s;ubject of <HI>di&s;ciplinary power</HI> generally congregational, and in no wi&s;e fond of the lower re&s;trictions of the elder&s;hips: and with re&s;pect to <HI>admi&s;&s;i|ons to communion,</HI> they were &s;o univer&s;ally congregational, that I &s;uppo&s;e there had not been an in&s;tance of church admi&s;&s;ion <HI>&s;ine fratrum &s;uffrag&uuml;s,</HI> without the votes of the brethren. This part of presbyteriani&s;m, viz. the elders admitting to communion, without the explicit concurrence of the church, never obtained among the fir&s;t churches. Several churches in compliance with the &s;entiments of their pa&s;tors, had the <HI>ruling</HI> and <HI>teaching</HI> elders at fir&s;t, as Well as the <HI>pa&s;tor:</HI> yet they at length di&s;u&s;ed the <HI>ruling</HI> elder; and the <HI>teaching</HI> elder as di&s;tinct from <HI>pa&s;tor</HI> is now dropt. The authority of this triumvirate never ro&s;e high; &s;ome few of our pious fathers early put in high claims for it, that it &s;hould be ve&s;ted with &s;upreme rule and &s;ole do|minion. But the &s;pirit of the churches would not bear this. The generality of the clergy, not merely from con|de&s;cention, and being overpowered by the prevailing &s;pirit of liberty, but I believe from hone&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion that it was the &s;cripture model, were for dividing all acts of rule and di&s;cipline between the <HI>elder&s;hip</HI> and <HI>fraternity,</HI> and rendering the concurrence of both nece&s;&s;ary. And here the churches clo&s;ed, only being at liberty to have, or not to have an elder&s;hip be&s;ides the pa&s;tor. Tho' the churches would not bear an actual negative of the elder&s;hip, whether in a &s;ingle per&s;on or more. Nothing of moment was car|ried from the beginning, without the explicit con&s;ent of the fraternity. Nor had they the lea&s;t notion of &s;urren|dering this priviledge, much le&s;s of &s;uffering &s;i&s;ter church|es either di&s;tinctly or conjunctly to have any juri&s;diction over them.

<P>Having taken this &s;urvey, we are prepared to judge on the platform it&s;elf, the &s;en&s;e in when it was conceived, the amended &s;en&s;e in which it pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ynod of 1648, and the &s;en&s;e in which it was, through the recommenda|tion of the general a&s;&s;embly, received by the churches, and la&s;tly the &s;en&s;e in which, by act of legi&s;lature, it in effect became the eccle&s;ia&s;tical provincial e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Connecticut.</HI> For by acts of legi&s;lature in the&s;e provinces parochial contracts for the &s;upport of the congregational clergy are enforcea|ble at law. And the&s;e acts having received the royal &s;anc|tion con&s;titute congregationali&s;m a <HI>legal</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hment. As to the platform it&s;elf, it is evident that it leaves the &s;crip|tures to be the &s;ole rule of faith, ordinances and di&s;cipline. As to what relates to authority and polity, tho' the com|pilers hoped to have introduced a triumvirate presbytery in each congregation to the reception of the churches, yet the authority of &s;uch presbytery was confined to &s;uch churches as received it, all being at liberty to u&s;e it or di&s;u&s;e it. That while the di&s;cipline and rule &s;hould at lea&s;t in part ve&s;t in the elder&s;hip of the pre&s;byteriated churches, the whole &s;hould ve&s;t in the fraternity of the congregational ones. And that no power &s;hould be ceded to councils as &s;uch. Accordingly the platform leaves each church with plenary unceded power, making the councils and &s;ynods advi&s;ory only and pro remata or occa|&s;ional:&mdash;not excepting the extraordinary ca&s;e of excom|municating a whole church, for this is not to be done by the council, but to obtain only upon the acts of particular churches. In the third way of communion, the judgment of the &s;ynod or council for declaring non-communion again&s;t an offending church is of no efficacy, but by <Q>par|ticular churches approving and accepting the judgment

of the &s;ynod<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Platform.</NOTE>,</Q> and re&s;pectively declaring the &s;en|tence of non-communion in each church. Thus at length with a multitude of inter&s;per&s;ions &s;ecuring the indepen|dency and uncontrolable power of the churches, it was pa&s;&s;ed and received as the plan of public confederacy, which united the <HI>presbyterians</HI> and <HI>independents</HI> under the one common title of congregationali&s;ts, before agreeing in doctrine, mode of wor&s;hip, ordinances, and the &s;elf-government of churches. This union did not introduce either to a juri&s;diction over one another, but left them the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their unceded peculiarities. They agreed that admi&s;&s;ions &s;hould be by the voice of the brotherhood &mdash;differing in this, that the rule and government &s;hould be divided between the elders and brethren in the one, and ve&s;t wholly in the brotherhood of the other: and that the ceremonies of pa&s;toral inve&s;titure might be performed by the elders of the one, and by delegated brethren of the other. The enjoyment of both the&s;e peculiarities was covenanted to remain to both re&s;pectively, without breach of charity or the union. It was a fundamental principle of the union, that every voluntary a&s;&s;embly of chri&s;tians had power to form, organize and govern them&s;elves, and in imitation of the apo&s;tolic churches to gather and incor|porate them&s;elves by a public covenant, and to elect and ordain all their public officers. They held communion with all prote&s;tant churches; yet held a peculiar fellow|&s;hip with the churches of their peculiar way and order: and thence the matters of principal moment, &s;uch as the gathering of churches and ordinations of pa&s;tors, they tran&s;acted in the pre&s;ence of the delegates of other church|es, whom they invited and called in as <HI>witne&s;&s;es</HI> of their &s;aith and order. The e&s;&s;ence of pa&s;toral ordination they held to con&s;i&s;t in the election and public covenant between the pa&s;tor and the church. The ceremony of pa&s;toral in&s;titution they held to be the le&s;&s;er act, which yet ought to be performed as the gathering of a church with fa&s;ting
<PB N="67" REF="009018_0066_10306EAC651BB1E0">
and prayer. The conducting of which religious ceremony was left to the elders in the presbyterian churches&mdash;in churches where there was no elder, the platform recom|mended the calling in and employing of the neighboring pa&s;tors to a&s;&s;i&s;t in ordination; yet with an explicit con|ce&s;&s;ion that even this might be performed <Q>by brethren orderly cho&s;en out of the church for this purpo&s;e.</Q> This in&s;ertion with others &s;hews the popular &s;en&s;e of liberty in our churches at that time: and the &s;ub&s;equent practice &s;ugge&s;ts the true idea of ordination councils, as u&s;ed in the&s;e churches.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e in which the platform was received may be further collected from the effect with which it has obtained. The popular &s;en&s;e was too &s;trong for the plan conceived by the clergy. The churches were really congregational from the beginning, and never fond of a presbytery for rule and government, nor were they ever plea&s;ed with the idea of a mixed congregationali&s;m devi&s;ed by our wi&s;e fore-fathers, in which the power was divided between the elders and the brethren. Nor did the di&s;tinction of pres|byterian and independent, and differences thereon &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;o much among the churches, as between the churches and the mini&s;ters&mdash;the mini&s;ters were for presbytery, the churches for congregationali&s;m unmixt. It was natural then for them, being left at liberty, to u&s;e it. Hence the di&s;tinctions have long &s;ince been lo&s;t in the one common name of congregationali&s;ts. The <HI>lay-elder</HI> (if this be not a &s;oleci&s;m) is almo&s;t intirely droped<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some few churches have two ruling elders, and &s;ome twelve.</NOTE>; and the <HI>teaching elder</HI> as di&s;tinct from <HI>pa&s;tor</HI> has long &s;ince been di&s;u&s;ed. Truly neither of the&s;e ever obtained in many of our churches after the fir&s;t generation. Two officers of the triumvirate cea&s;ing, the di&s;ciplinary authority of con&s;equence ve&s;ts in the fraternity: unle&s;s perhaps in the few churches originally mixt (for I know of none, or not more than one of the fir&s;t churches purely presbyterian) where the pa&s;tor may

continue to retain a negative on the church, or in the language of our ance&s;tors, where the power of rule is in the elder, and the power of priviledge only in the brethren. And under the umbrage of tho&s;e clau&s;es &s;ecuring this power to the elders of presbyteriated churches, the pa&s;tors of &s;ome churches purely congregational have claimed and a&s;|&s;umed this power. But according to the true principles of congregationali&s;m, the pa&s;tor, be&s;ides being moderator of church meetings, or pre&s;ident of the chri&s;tian fraternity, has but the authority of a private brother in the rule and government of the church. The platform happily &s;uc|ceded in preventing lay-ordinations. And as to councils, they &s;tand ju&s;t as the platform provided at the invitation and election of the particular church, and in their deci&s;i|ons <HI>advi&s;ory</HI> only. This is the polity on which the body of the New England churches now &s;tand, except a few who have formed them&s;elves on the true presbyterian model according to Scotland, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of acce&s;|&s;ions of the pre&s;ent century, and a number of the Con|necticut churches.</P>
<P>Having con&s;idered the nature of <HI>congregational councils.</HI> I procede to &s;hew the origin and nature of <HI>con&s;ociated councils,</HI> which obtain in Connecticut. So early as 1662 there were propo&s;als in the &s;ynod at Bo&s;ton drawn up by Mr. Shepard, for re&s;olving the whole body of the churches into con&s;ociations, that is, that each di&s;trict of neighboring churches &s;hould by their pa&s;tors and me&s;&s;engers a&s;&s;emble annually in a &s;tanding council to hear and give judgement on eccle&s;ia&s;tical controver&s;ies. But this propo&s;al dropt, not being acceded to by the churches, but &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by them, as they judged them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ufficient power to govern them&s;elves. A few years after this, the mini&s;ters of &s;everal vicinities had formed them&s;elves into a&s;&s;ociations or pa&s;toral meetings for prayer on occa&s;ion of the indian wars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE ASSOCIATIONS begun about A.

about 30 years, began to be de&s;irous of a&s;&s;uming the con|&s;ociated form&mdash;which might ea&s;ily be done if the churches could be prevailed on to delegate &s;ome of the brethren to accompany the mini&s;ters and &s;it with them in their pa&s;toral meeting, and withal prevail on the churches to refer their difficulties to this annual or bi&s;annual a&s;&s;embly. Several of the mini&s;ters had urged all the &s;pecious arguments, but without &s;ucce&s;s. The early anticipated danger of intro|ducing what might finally terminate in foreign juri&s;diction, prevented the churches from acceding to the propo&s;als of 1662. In 1700 the&s;e propo&s;als were ripened into a for|mal plan for erecting the <HI>a&s;&s;ociations</HI> into <HI>con&s;ociations</HI> or &s;tanding councils with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute power and juri&s;|diction over the churches; admitting appeals only to a <HI>general con&s;ociation</HI> compo&s;ed of delegates from the &s;eve|ral particular con&s;ociations, and ve&s;ted with a definitive binding &s;entence. This plan begun to pa&s;s the a&s;&s;ociati|ons in 1705, as a previous &s;tep to its being recommended and adopted by the churches. But the oppo&s;ition it met with from mo&s;t of the a&s;&s;ociations, and the yet una&s;&s;oci|ated pa&s;tors again prevented its being recommended to the churches, where it would have met with &s;till greater oppo|&s;ition through the &s;pirit of liberty. Though it failed in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, yet two years after, it was re&s;um|ed and carried into execution among the churches of Con|necticut, which at this time were, as I take it, univer&s;ally congregationali&s;ts, tho' &s;everal of the principal mini&s;ters were inclined to the presbyterian rule and government of church|es. There were at this time about 40 churches in that colony. On the recommendation of the provincial legi&s;|lature, which bad been previou&s;ly procured, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Very much through the influences of the honorable Gordon Salton|&s;tall, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Governor of the colony, a learned divine, who had been formerly one of the pa&s;tors.</NOTE> the <HI>pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>me&s;&s;engers</HI> of the churches in the four counties a&s;&s;em|bled in four &s;eparate conventions, and draughted or pa&s;&s;ed four prepared models of church di&s;cipline, as nearly re|&s;embling

that of 1705 as the &s;pirit of the churches and pa&s;tors would admit, for &s;everal of the principal pa&s;tors were truly congregational. The&s;e &s;eparate conventions delegated each perhaps two or more pa&s;tors with their re|&s;pective me&s;&s;engers, to meet in a general convention, and compo&s;e out of the &s;everal remitted models a plan of di&s;cipline for public e&s;tabli&s;hment. The&s;e delegates from the county conventions a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Saybrook</HI> in 1708, to the number of perhaps 10 or 12 pa&s;tors, and perhaps twice as many me&s;&s;engers.

The &s;ynod having thus combined together the <HI>confe&s;&s;ion, heads of agreement,</HI> and <HI>articles for di&s;cipline,</HI> as an eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution; it was recommended by the general a&s;&s;embly of the colony, and received by mo&s;t of the churches. A &s;ub&s;equent act of the general a&s;&s;embly has declared &s;uch churches as accede to this con&s;titution, to have a <HI>legal e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> in that colony, not however exclu&s;ive of congregationali&s;m, which has equally a legal e&s;tabli&s;hment. Thus there are three forms of religion e&s;tabli&s;hed in the german empire. In virtue of this agreement and con&s;titution, the acceding churches were re&s;olved into four con&s;ociations, which are now increa&s;ed to nine. The&s;e con&s;ociations con&s;i&s;t of two e&s;tates, the <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> and <HI>me&s;&s;engers,</HI> in effect &s;eparate in their acts; for though they &s;it, deliberate and vote to|gether in council, yet their acts are of &s;eparate import;

for being two di&s;tinct bodies in point of cognizance &amp; juri&s;|diction, they are &s;o ve&s;ted with a negative on each other, that the concurrence of both in a certain new manner is nece&s;&s;ary to complete an act of council<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This platform by implication ve&s;ts a mini&s;ter with a negative on his church in all her acts. And in council it has thrown a very great ba|lance of power into the hands of the mini&s;ters, even to more than a negative on the me&s;&s;engers. For a majority of the pa&s;tors with &s;o many of the me&s;&s;engers as make a majority of the council make a vote: but not a majority of the me&s;&s;engers and &s;o many of the pa&s;tors as make a majority of council. On the pre&s;ent footing, the churches have not an equal active repre&s;entation in council: they may indeed &s;end as many me&s;&s;engers as they plea&s;e, and this is the only way left them to retrieve the balance of power they lo&s;t in 1708. Thus in a council of 20 pa&s;tors and 20 churches, if the 20 church|es &s;end but one me&s;&s;enger each, then 15 pa&s;tors and 6 me&s;&s;engers may make an act contrary to the &s;en&s;e of 14 churches.

Now though the churches have right to &s;end three or more, yet it was ea&s;ily fore&s;een that there was no probability of their &s;ending more than two, and generally but one. Now on the whole two que&s;tions occur, whether the pa&s;tors are ve&s;ted with this particular degree of power and influence in the rule of the churches by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t? and whether this particular plan of di&s;|cipline and con&s;titution of councils is pre&s;cribed in the &s;criptures? If not, the whole is a human agreement and confederacy, not at all partaking of the nature of a divine in&s;titution: and though it may &s;ub&s;erve valuable purpo&s;es, is not to be conceived as an ordinance of God.</NOTE>. There at pre|&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;ts a difference of &s;entiment among worthy and pious men, who are real friends to the churches, re&s;pecting the <HI>powers of churches,</HI> and the powers of <HI>con&s;ociations,</HI> which &s;hall &s;ubordinate when in competition. This dif|ference of &s;entiment I take to be very little among the churches, nor between the pa&s;tors and churches in general, but chiefly among the venerable clergy. The churches is I take it make no que&s;tion with re&s;pect to their own plenary and uncontrollable power. The pre&s;ent
<PB N="72" REF="009018_0071_10306EB90E2ED048">
difference among the pa&s;tors might be healed by charity and amicable conde&s;centions, with the retention of their re&s;pective judgments as was done the la&s;t century upon the differences between the presbyterian and congregational pa&s;tors as to church power. The litigation of pa&s;toral controver&s;ies une&s;pou&s;ed by the churches, e&s;pecially on the &s;ubject of the pa&s;toral powers, excepting tho&s;e with which they are evidently inve&s;ted by the great head of the church, is peculiarly unhappy in the pre&s;ent rapid increa&s;e of our churches, when it is our true intere&s;t for both pa&s;|tors and churches to be cemented by benevolence and union. The pretext on one &s;ide is here&s;y: but here&s;y is to be encountered in this age by rea&s;oning and appeals to the &s;acred oracles, not by the deci&s;ions of unin&s;pired coun|cils. If councils were by the explicit voluntary act of the churches ve&s;ted with ten times more authority than is claimed for them by their warme&s;t advocates, they could never decide the point. The &s;criptures are the only rule of prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>But whatever be the pretexts on either &s;ides, the powers of the con&s;ociations being not known in the &s;criptures, are to be determined by an appeal to the platform that con&s;ti|tutes them. And in order to judge of this we mu&s;t enter into the &s;en&s;e and de&s;ign with which it was conceived, and that in which it was adopted by the churches&mdash;that we may reconcile tho&s;e parts of it which interfere with, if they do not contradict, one another. Taken literally, it in the fir&s;t place &s;tipulates the ab&s;olute un&s;ubbordinate power of particular churches. It afterwards ve&s;ts the <HI>con&s;ociated council</HI> with authorative final deci&s;ion on all matters of di&s;cipline &s;ubmitted to it by the churches of the circuit. It at length ve&s;ts the council with general and original juri&s;diction on "all occa&s;ions eccle&s;ia&s;tical." It &s;hould &s;eem al&s;o by &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, that it is ve&s;ted with the <HI>power of the keys,</HI> the power of declaring non-communion on a particular church, Now the que&s;tion is,
<PB N="73" REF="009018_0072_10306EBFC2F37288">
whether this amounts to transferring the power out of the churches into the council, in which they are thus repre|&s;ented? If it does, then there is a contradiction. And the next que&s;tion is, upon a competition, which &s;hall loo&s;e their power, the <HI>particular churches,</HI> or the <HI>con&s;ociation?</HI> The <HI>deci&s;ive power</HI> when a&s;&s;embled, and the power to a&s;|&s;emble uncalled upon <HI>"all occa&s;ions eccle&s;ia&s;tical,"</HI> if bona fide ceded by the churches, amounts in my opinion to an intire and ab&s;olute &s;urrendery of all power and liber|ty from the churches, and may in time be claimed and de|manded. For with &s;uch power the con&s;ociations may in|terdict any eccle&s;ia&s;tical proce&s;s in the churches on any eccle&s;ia&s;tical matter, and with &s;uch prohibition remove it out of the hands of a particular church into the council.

<P>Let us then con&s;ider the &s;en&s;e in which it was received by the churches. And here we are to remark that the platform it&s;elf provides and &s;tipulates that <Q>none of our particular churches &s;hall be &s;ubordinate to one another, each being endowed with equality of power from Je&s;us

<P>If the council has juri&s;diction on all matters, whether &s;ubmitted or not; then the churches in their individual and &s;eparate capacities may po&s;&s;ibly have none at all, becau&s;e the council may po&s;&s;ibly take cognizance of all. But if the council can take cognizance of one matter with|out the con&s;ent of the church; then in that one ca&s;e the church has no power. If it was fir&s;t agreed that each in their &s;eparate and individual capacities &s;hould take cogni|zance and determine all matters within the church: and afterwards it was re&s;tricted to their repre&s;entation in coun|cil, would not this &s;ubvert the fir&s;t principle? Was the thing &s;o apprehended by the churches? Or can it be con|tended that the churches power and con&s;ociations do not interfere, when the latter without the con&s;ent of the for|mer take a matter out of her hands and determine it? If the church puts it into the con&s;ociation, her power is given up&mdash;&s;he has no deci&s;ion of her own, but mu&s;t &s;ub|mit to the deci&s;ion of the council, unle&s;s &s;he applied to the council for advice only, and not for a judicial decree. This is a great &s;urrendery. But to ve&s;t a foreign body with power to come and take a matter regularly depend|ing and i&s;&s;uable in the church, and determine upon it con|trary to the &s;en&s;e of the church, is a &s;till greater, even an intire &s;urrendery of all power, or at lea&s;t &s;ubmitting to

Is not this effectually to &s;ubordinate particular churches to one another? and enabling a number of churches and their officers to exerci&s;e power and have &s;uperiority over ano|ther church and her officers? Or was it meant that truly one church &s;hould not exerci&s;e dominion over another, un|le&s;s &s;he could gain a number of her &s;ide, and then indeed &s;he might? And was it indeed the de&s;ign of the churches to &s;ubordinate a particular church to the body? Would not each embodied church thus derive an acce&s;&s;ion of pow|er in her united capacity, and thus become ve&s;ted with an unavoidable &s;uperiority? And does not this mutual acce&s;|&s;ion of power de&s;troy the individual equality of churches, and effectually &s;ubordinate them to one another as well as to the body? If A B and C equal and un&s;ubordinate, ve&s;t one another with a controlling power, &s;o that A can|not act without the con&s;ent of B or C, and &s;o for all&mdash; this is a mutual transferring of power; in which transfer|red or modeled power A B and C equally partake, and thus become <HI>equal</HI> in power. But does not this equality of acce&s;&s;ional and interchangeable power de&s;troy the <HI>fir&s;t equality?</HI> and is not this peculiarly modelled equality a mutual &s;ubordination of the whole? It is mo&s;t certainly. If &s;o, the fir&s;t or la&s;t mu&s;t be given up. Liberty may in|fer equality of power; all equalities of power do not in|fer liberty. But if A B and C covenant that they will not act without the advice of one another, with re&s;ervation of power to act contrary to advice, liberty and equality are &s;aved. If they covenant that when they &s;ubmit a matter to one another it &s;hall be final, and retain the power of &s;ubmitting, the <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>equality</HI> are pre&s;erved.

The fathers &s;tipulated for the churches the mo&s;t <HI>perfect</HI> liberty. It is po&s;&s;ible in time there may be one or more provincial confederacies or generalities here, and an audi|ence or common <HI>council of &s;tate</HI> for civil admini&s;tration &s;tanding on free provincial elections, Even the <HI>con&s;ulate</HI> and <HI>&s;enate</HI> of the roman empire &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a long time on elections, and the&s;e not &s;eptonnial or triennial but an|nual. There would be an e&s;&s;ential difference between &s;ubordinating the provinces to the re&s;olutions of the &s;u|preme council of &s;tate, tho' of their own electing; between this I &s;ay, and their re&s;erving to them&s;elves a power to ratify or annual tho&s;e re&s;olutions. Even the fir&s;t is pre|ferable to foreign appointments, and in a &s;en&s;e may be &s;aid to be a valuable liberty and privilege: but true ge|nuine liberty con&s;i&s;ts only with the la&s;t. The united pro|vinces of Holland have found they can &s;ub&s;i&s;t in this manner: and after all that has been &s;aid, this form of polity is not more liable to convul&s;ions and revolutions than any other. But however it may be in other re&s;pects, it is certain that with re&s;pect to LIBERTY, the provinces will prefer that plan of confederacy which re&s;erves to them in their &s;eparate capacities the approbation or di&s;approbation of the plans or political mea&s;ures conceived and remitted to them from the &s;upreme common council.

<P>The churches felt the importance of re&s;erving to them|&s;elves the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of cau&s;es to the con&s;ociation. They at once perceiv'd, that if the con&s;ociation could of their own motion a&s;&s;emble upon a church and authoritatively

take out of her hands the judicial deci&s;ion of cau&s;es, their liberty was gone. Accordingly, when April 13, 1709 the churches of New Haven county, by their patters and me&s;&s;engers fir&s;t formed them&s;elves into a con&s;ocia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, in con&s;equence of the Saybrook agreement, they acceded to the agreement upon certain re&s;tricting explanations, which &s;hew as well the public &s;pirit of liberty, as the &s;en&s;e in which they adopted the platform. In the&s;e explanations it was &s;tipulated that a majority, both of me&s;&s;engers and pa&s;tors was nece&s;&s;ary to an act&mdash;that the &s;entence of non communion was not definitive, nor to be declared till it had pa&s;&s;ed the approbation of particular churches&mdash;that <Q>churches may call a council before they procede to cen&s;ure, but without their allowance no particular per&s;on &s;hall have a council before excommunication:</Q> E&s;&s;en|tially agreeable to that fundamental principle of their union, "that none of our particular churches &s;hall be &s;ubordinate to one another, "nor excerci&s;e power, or have any &s;uperiority over any other church, or their officers," No &s;ub&s;equent expre&s;&s;ions to be taken in a &s;en&s;e &s;ubver|&s;ive of this, becau&s;e in them&s;elves null and void.</P>
<P>On the whole, it &s;eems to appear that however the power and &s;ubordinate equality of churches is &s;ecured in the beginning of the platform, yet there are afterwards &s;uch in&s;ertions, which, if taken literally, would &s;ubvert the fir&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able principle. In con&s;equence and un|der the umbrage of which it is demanded as a right that each con&s;ociation, charged with the in&s;pection of its churches, have power to arraign and depo&s;e a pa&s;tor with|out, and even contrary to, the con&s;ent of his church,&mdash; take "all cau&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;tical" out of the hands of the church, and judicially decide them&mdash;and if the church de|nies this power and juri&s;diction, to arraign the whole church, deci&s;ively judge upon her, and enforce their decree with the &s;entence of non-communion. In this &s;en&s;e it &s;hould &s;eem that the con&s;titution has e&s;tabli&s;hed two powers in|con&s;i&s;tent

in exerci&s;e, the <HI>uncontrolled power</HI> of particular churches, and the <HI>controlling power</HI> of the con&s;ociations. And if the &s;pirit of liberty did not prevent, it may become a rule for the con&s;ociations in virtue of the clau&s;e, <Q>all occa&s;ions eccle&s;ia&s;tical, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The exten&s;ive juri&s;diction of the High Commi&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on a like comprehen&s;ive clau&s;e, "all affairs eccle&s;ia&s;tical."

But this was not the &s;en&s;e of the churches, when they received the platform. The princi|pal alteration which they deemed was this, that whereas the congregational councils were elected promi&s;cuou&s;ly from the churches, the churches were now limited to the con&s;ociated council as a &s;tanding council on matters of di&s;|cipline, which they ve&s;ted with a deci&s;ive power on matters which they &s;ubmitted to them&mdash;and which they might on all other matters repair to, advi&s;e with and con&s;ult as con|gregational councils. A hi&s;tory of the con&s;ociations from the beginning to this time, and the u&s;e which the churches have made of the con&s;ociations, would abundantly evince this. It is further to be remembered, that they never once thought of any alterations re&s;pecting ordination coun|cils, and lea&s;t of all, that the con&s;ociation exclu&s;ive &s;hould have the power of ordination in the circuit, as appears from the uninterrupted u&s;uage of the churches for the fir&s;t 40 years after the platform, in which I &s;uppo&s;e there was not a &s;ingle in&s;tance of <HI>con&s;ociated</HI> ordinations. All the&s;e claims are of modern date, and defen&s;ible only upon tho&s;e novel interpretations which are &s;ubver&s;ive of the fir&s;t grand fundamental principle of the union. The Connecticut churches remain at liberty to chu&s;e what mini&s;ters they plea&s;e, to ordain their pa&s;tors elect, and what churches they
<PB N="80" REF="009018_0079_10306ED7E6E5A828">
plea&s;e for a fraternal witne&s;s of the &s;olemnity, and from whom al&s;o to a&s;k and receive the <HI>right hand of fellow&s;hip.</HI> For the right hand of fellow&s;hip may either upon the prin|ciples of chri&s;tianity, or the platform, be as regularly re|ceived from the congregational churches, as the con&s;ociated ones, even by the con&s;ociated churches them&s;elves, as has been repeatedly the fact. The fellow&s;hip and communi|on is indi&s;criminately held among both. The pa&s;tors a|lone with the con&s;ent of the electing church, ordain the pa&s;tor elect; and in the name of them&s;elves and the churches, give the right hand of hand of fellow&s;hip, to denote their willingne&s;s to walk together in pa&s;toral and church communion.</P>
<P>As the platforms are &s;uppo&s;ed to receive great efficacy from their becoming provincial e&s;tabli&s;hments, it is nece&s;|&s;ary to con&s;ider this al&s;o. Antecedent to the platforms, the three colonies of Plymouth. Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connec|ticut, made and continued to make pari&s;hes by acts of their re&s;pective a&s;&s;emblies, and ve&s;ted them with power to tax them&s;elves for the &s;upport of &s;uch pa&s;tors and teachers as they &s;hould elect. The &s;ame thing was continued after the platforms were adopted by the re&s;pective acts of legi&s;|lature as provincial e&s;tabli&s;hments, and e&s;pecially after the pre&s;ent charters. Which acts in the provinces of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire, receiving the Royal &s;anction after the revolution, as fully e&s;tabli&s;h congregationali&s;m in tho&s;e two provinces, as the acts of parliament and the uni|on e&s;tabli&s;h epi&s;copacy in South Britain, and presbytery in North Britain. And the a&s;&s;embly of Connecticut being ve&s;ted by royal charter with plenary legi&s;lative power, the religious e&s;tabli&s;hment of that colony is compleat, as all her other legi&s;lative acts are, without the royal &s;anction: e&s;pe|cially as it is an e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;ame thing which has received the royal approbation in the neighbouring pro|vince, which gives a declared con&s;truction of that particu|lar law or act, as not being contrary to the acts of parlia|ment;
<PB N="81" REF="009018_0080_10306ED9D0970260">
e&s;pecially this is con&s;entancous to that part of the act of union which e&s;tabli&s;hes a &s;imilar religious in&s;titution for Scotland. Now all the force which a particular form of religion receives from a civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, whether na|tional or provincial, is from the temporalities and civil im|munities annexed by the legi&s;lature. With regard to im|munities and public &s;ecular offices, all religious, prota&s;tant &s;ects are equally privileged in New-England. But the legal power to tax a &s;ociety for the maintenance of mini|&s;ters, and other parochial charges, belongs to but one gene|ral denomination, the <HI>congregationali&s;ts,</HI> under their &s;ome|what different forms, excepting that the epi&s;copalians in Connecticut, under certain limitations, have power to tax them&s;elves. And legally tho&s;e churches or a&s;&s;emblies that are independent presbyterians, or Scotch presbyterians, or congregationali&s;ts truly &s;uch, or la&s;tly congregationali&s;ts on the Saybrook model, are congregational only in law. The law con&s;iders them, not is churches purely,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The churches, as di&s;tinct from the congregation, are bodies corporate to the purpo&s;e of receiving and improving benefactions, and hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> e&s;tates ad pios u&s;us; but not for taxing them&s;elves for the &s;upport of the mini&s;try.</NOTE> but as as parochial congregations, allowed in their religious form to model them&s;elves as they plea&s;e, as they judge mo&s;t a|greeable to the &s;criptures. The legal efficacy of their acts re&s;ults, not from the religious form, but from the paro|chial powers with which they are endowed. The pari&s;hes are to certain purpo&s;es incorporate, bodies known in the law; the efficacy of parochial contracts all i&s;&s;ue from the parochial powers; and the contracts with pa&s;tors depend not at all for their validity in law upon any of the forms of ordination, whether performed by elders in a church and pa&s;tors out of the church, or whether indeed there be no ordination at all. For I &s;uppo&s;e if a pari&s;h in their pa|rochial corporate capacity &s;hould contract with an unor|dained preacher at an annual &s;tipend for life, upon con|dition
<PB N="82" REF="009018_0081_10306EDB8823BD80">
of his performing divine &s;ervice every Lord's-day, that it would be equally valid in law as if he was ordained, or equally valid as if made with a &s;chool-ma&s;ter for life or during good behavior. And this &s;eems &s;till more evident, not only from the nature of parochial powers, but from hence, that the pa&s;toral contract of legal validity antecedes ordination in all ca&s;es. Unle&s;s the parochial call and ac|ceptance be deemed only preparatory to the public en&s;eal|ing and ratification of the contract; yet even here, the tran&s;action which induces legal obligation is only that part of ordination in which the call and acceptance is publicly ratified&mdash;and yet as this is a covenant only between the pa&s;tor and church, and not explicitly between the pa&s;tor and congregation, which is only eccle&s;ia&s;tical, it &s;hould &s;eem that that which has legal efficacy on the inhabitants of the pari&s;h or congregation as &s;uch, is the antecedent contract. But &s;uppo&s;ing it depends on ordination, and that the legal covenant is not perfected till the &s;olemnities of the inve&s;titure: yet by the univer&s;al practice of our churches, the ordination may be performed by whom&s;o|ever the church de&s;ire to do it. And in in&s;tallments in particular, it is indifferent whether this antecedent ordi|nation has been performed by congregational pa&s;tors, or by tho&s;e who have had ordination according to the church of Scotland. All pa&s;tors have the power of ordination, and can confer holy orders on whom&s;oever they judge qualified, and at the de&s;ire of a particular church can give him the pa&s;toral charge of that church&mdash;when &s;uch pa&s;tor is ordained, and &s;uch church organized with a pa&s;tor to all purpo&s;es civil as well as eccle&s;ia&s;tical. And though it is always de&s;irable that there &s;hould be a harmony among the churches, and though perhaps it would not be prudent for the church to de&s;ire it, or the pa&s;tors to perform it upon the &s;ure pro&s;pect of di&s;union, yet when it is done, whe|ther agreeable or di&s;agreeable to &s;i&s;ter churches and con|gregations, the parochial immunities are unhurt, and the

procedure valid both eccle&s;ia&s;tically and legally, &s;o far as the law takes any notice of it. This was early and all along the practice of our churches, and the platforms have induced no alterations in it.</P>
<P>The whole religious e&s;tabli&s;hment of New England is congregationali&s;m, except in the colony of Rhode I&s;land, where the legi&s;lative e&s;tabli&s;hment is univer&s;al prote&s;tant liberty, but without annexing parochial privileges to any &s;ect. Here no religious congregations or &s;ocieties are bodies known in the law, and all benefactions, regularly ought to be made to <HI>&s;eoffees in tru&s;t.</HI> In The three other New England governments, all parochial congregations are bodies corporate. The legi&s;lature of Connecticut in par|ticular have enacted, <Q>that the inhabitants of any town or &s;ociety or pari&s;h con&s;tituted by this a&s;&s;embly who are pre&s;ent at a town or &s;ociety meeting legally warned, &s;hall have power by the major vote of tho&s;e &s;o met to call and &s;ettle a mini&s;ter or mini&s;ters among them</Q>&mdash; and <Q>that the mini&s;ter &s;o called and &s;ettled &s;hall be the mini&s;ter of &s;uch town or &s;ociety.</Q><Q>&mdash;and all agree|ments&mdash;made by the major part of the inhabitants&mdash; with &s;uch mini&s;ter or mini&s;ters re&s;pecting his or their &s;ettlement, &amp;c. &s;hall be binding and obligatory on all the inhabitants of &s;uch town or &s;ociety&mdash;and their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors.</Q> And again, <Q>all &s;uch towns and &s;ocieties or pari&s;hes by their proper votes or acts &s;hall annually&mdash; grant a tax for the purpo&s;e afore&s;aid, to be levied on their inhabitants according to their re&s;pective li&s;ts.</Q> From hence it appears, that all which induces legal obli|gations is to be done by the inhabitants or members of the congregation&mdash;the act of the church in pa&s;toral electi|on as di&s;tinct from the congregation is not nece&s;&s;ary, though I &s;uppo&s;e univer&s;ally practiced, except in one in|&s;tance. The churches as &s;uch are legal bodies for receiv|ing and holding e&s;tates, but not for regulating the &s;ettle|ment of pa&s;tors. In this the laws univer&s;ally con&s;ider the

<P>If a pari&s;h church on the congregational platform &s;hould for rea&s;ons renounce it for the Saybrook, or la&s;tly &s;hould renounce both for the purely &s;criptural model; the pari&s;h is the &s;ame pari&s;h, amid&s;t all the mutations of its church, enjoying the &s;ame civil and legal immunities and powers, and is treated by the legi&s;lature as all other pari&s;hes of the congregational platform. And however the churches may have confederated among them&s;elves and may be affected by the deci&s;ions of council; yet the pari&s;h con|gregation, or the churches con&s;idered as part of the pa|rochial congregation are unaffected&mdash;if in its eccle&s;ia&s;tic capacity it is affected, in its congregational it is not: its &s;piritualities may be touched, but not its temporalities. Whenever the&s;e &s;hall be connected&mdash;the affecting the one will &s;en&s;ibly affect the other. But as the ca&s;e now &s;tands, if the con&s;ociation a&s;&s;ume even the deci&s;ion with which by the platform it is ve&s;ted (much more, &s;hould it happen to a&s;&s;ume an un&s;urrendered con&s;titutional juri&s;diction) and decree contrary to the &s;en&s;e of the <HI>congregation</HI> and the pari&s;h <HI>church;</HI> the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is not touched&mdash;and one vote which they have power to make among them&s;elves with|draws the <HI>latter</HI> from this juri&s;diction, without the lea&s;t de|triment to her temporalities or eccle&s;ia&s;tical liberty:&mdash;as has been repeatedly done: nay, if even excommunicated by the whole body of churches, yet has &s;he the &s;ame legal privileges as all the others. When a church and congregation have become large, they often on differences divide: the minor or withdrawing part form by &s;pontaneous voluntary act into a congregation, and gather a church, and elect a pa&s;tor, whom they reque&s;t &s;ome of the neighbouring pa&s;tors to ordain and confer holy orders upon. All this is done or may be done, for it has been often done from the beginning, antecedent to the a&s;&s;embly's forming them

into a pari&s;h. Now whenever it has received pari&s;h pow|ers, it is in all re&s;pects &s;ecure as to its temporalities, whe|ther the church be in follow&s;hip with the body of church|es or not. A new pari&s;h may be erected in the old pa|rochial bounds on the application of aggrieved brethren: but the &s;tanding party remain and continue a pari&s;h, and even the fir&s;t pari&s;h and church as they hold under the fir&s;t, and not a &s;ub&s;equent appointment. And in all in|&s;tances in Connecticut but one, the two pari&s;hes formed within the &s;ame parochial bounds are of different forms as to their churches. And the act of a&s;&s;embly incorpo|rating a new pari&s;h into a body known in the law, does not de&s;troy the fir&s;t pari&s;h, nor affect its antecedent acts and agreements "made by the major vote of the inhabi|tants." This whether the fir&s;t pari&s;h church be con&s;oci|ated, congregational, or presbyterian; whether this year the one, or by vote of it&s;elf the next year another.</P>
<P>This being the &s;tate of the religious e&s;tabli&s;hments in New-England, and in Connecticut in particular, it appears that all claims of councils or con&s;ociations, with re&s;pect to juri&s;dictions and deci&s;ions in oppo&s;ition to the &s;en&s;e of particular churches and parochial congregations, may be fruitle&s;s and to little purpo&s;e, be&s;ides a temporary em|broiling of the churches. Be&s;ides, that through &s;ome un|happy principles re&s;pecting the terms of communion and the qualification of communicants, by which multitudes of &s;ober, pious and virtuous chri&s;tians are deterred from the ordinances, our churches are often but a &s;mall part of the parochial congregations. And it is the congregation in its parochial congregational capacity that the law con&s;iders: And this as &s;uch does not enough partake of an eccle&s;i|a&s;tical nature to be &s;ubject to eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;dictions; or to have the validity of any of its acts dependent on the de|ci&s;ions of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council. And even at to the in|fluence of the&s;e deci&s;ions on the churches as &s;uch. they perhaps had better be left as tho&s;e of the congregational

councils <HI>advi&s;ory</HI> only, according to the &s;en&s;e in which it is probable that the Connecticut churches received their platform. All that is beyond this, till the public &s;pirit be &s;ubdued, mu&s;t endanger conte&s;ts and oppo&s;itions, in which the public benevolence and liberty may &s;uffer. And it is to be remarked, that even con&s;ociated churches have often called in congregational councils to advi&s;e on difficulties; which &s;hews that they did not under&s;tand them&s;elves re|&s;tricted to the con&s;ociated councils. And it is further to be remarked, that the churches of the apo&s;tolic age knew nothing of con&s;ociated or congregational councils, nor their powers; but &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the full enjoyment of unembar|ra&s;&s;ed liberty. No apo&s;tolic church had authority over another, either in an individual or aggregate capacity. The claims of authority in con&s;ociated councils over the chur|ches, are not only contrary to the primitive pattern, but probably will not prevail in New-England, unle&s;s the legi&s;latures enact that no congregational churches &s;hall have benefit of the laws. It is &s;aid that there are &s;everal churches in Connecticut which have not acceded to the platform, mo&s;t of which are congregational; and yet have the &s;ame immunities and privileges with the others. And any may renounce the platform when they plea&s;e, as has been done in &s;ome in&s;tances, and yet are in full charity and communion with the con&s;ociated churches. It might be happy if they could all walk together on the con|&s;ociated form, as they probably would do in time, if the con&s;ociation &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for fellow&s;hip only, and not for do|minion, which e&s;&s;entially interferes with the &s;tipulated equality of churches. Nor can the con&s;ociations regularly, I mean con&s;i&s;tently, declare non-communion with one of the&s;e congregational churches, unle&s;s they do with all&mdash; If the cau&s;e or crime be only their denial of their juri&s;|diction, becau&s;e they well know that all congregational churches agree in denying this juri&s;diction.

Nor that every church acceding to the union &s;hould be obliged to &s;end delegates to the con|&s;ociation in all cau&s;es: as to this, they were at their liberty. And the churches have frequently omitted this, as I am told. Nor can a con&s;ociation regularly by the platform declare non-communion jure &s;ynodali, for this, or a real crime in the church &s;uppo&s;ed offending, e&s;pecially in New-Haven county, becau&s;e the churches of that circuit, at their fir&s;t forming into a con&s;ociation in 1709, expre&s;ly covenanted that the &s;entence of non-communion &s;hould be referred back to the particular churches of the circuit, and obtain on their particular acts. Hence half a dozen churches may for pre&s;ent rea&s;ons decline &s;ending their el|ders and me&s;&s;engers to a con&s;ociation for &s;uch time as they plea&s;e, and yet continue members of the union, and re|main upon the platform, and may afterwards re&s;ume their rights, till &s;uch time as they voluntarily renounce the union, or are excommunicated by the acts of the particular churches of the circuit.

All this is &s;aid upon &s;uppo&s;ition that the ejected church or churches be the &s;ame as to doctrine and manner of wor&s;hip with the generality of the churches, and that the denial of foreign eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction be the <HI>only</HI> rea&s;on of non-commu|nion.

<P>This is the ca&s;e as matters now &s;tand. We have &s;een what efficacy the platforms have received from the legi&s;la|tive regulations about religion. And that in effect they have not entered into any of the di&s;tinctions, but con&s;ider all only as different &s;pecies of congregationnali&s;m. All that is done is only to incorporate the congregation&mdash;the congregations model them&s;elves as they plea&s;e. No tem|poralities or immunities are annexed to any unions or com|bined clu&s;ters of churches, or to any public re&s;olutions i&s;&s;uing from &s;uch combination. Perhaps it would be well if all our churches were re&s;olved into friendly con&s;oci|ations for mutual aid and fellow&s;hip. All unions indeed forming an aggregate of powers, are liable, and too apt to terminate in juri&s;dictions. Not that the&s;e coalitions are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The apo&s;tolic churches &s;ub&s;i&s;ted without either&mdash;as I have &s;aid they knew not either con|&s;ociations or cla&s;&s;es or their powers&mdash;and whenever they

take place they mu&s;t obtain on other pre&s;criptions than tho&s;e particularly &s;pecified by the apo&s;tles, or our common Lord.

Many of the&s;e things, not entering into the e&s;&s;ence of re|ligion, are left to human di&s;cretion. The late reverend Dr. COLMAN was a friend to con&s;ociations of churches, but not in a &s;en&s;e &s;ubver&s;ive of congregationali&s;m, for he looked upon them not the de&s;truction, but the "very &s;oul and life of the congregational &s;cheme"&mdash;Now they would prove the death of the congregational &s;cheme if the churches be &s;ubordinated to their juri&s;dictions, <HI>for of whom a man is overcome, of the &s;ame is he brought in bondage</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. ii. 19.</NOTE>, and this even <HI>while they promi&s;e them&s;elves liberty.</HI> Fel|low&s;hip and benevolence, not dominion, was the great characteri&s;tic of this venerable divine, who&s;e prai&s;e is in all the churches.

<P>The churches are at pre&s;ent above 500, and increa&s;ing amain. They might form 20 con&s;ociations be&s;ides tho&s;e of Connecticut.

And among our&s;elves, let it not break our communion if any of our churches give up all their liberty, or retain it all in their own hands. If the great end is an an&s;wered of making men virtuous and good, let us rejoice, though the means are diver&s;ified. Particu|larly let us of the congregational communion in New-England, under the different forms of our churches, culti|vate a venerable regard for one another; rejoice that we are &s;o well agreed in purity of doctrine and wor&s;hip, and walk together by the &s;ame rule, <HI>&s;o far as we are agreed:</HI> and for the re&s;t, let us endeavour to hope and think and &s;peak the be&s;t of one another, in all our differences, put|ting on forbearance, charity and a conde&s;cending benevo|lence.</P>
<P N="3">III. I come now at length to con&s;ider the expediency of harmony and union, e&s;pecially among the congregational churches in New-England. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t argument may be taken from the impor|tance of the cau&s;e in it&s;elf con&s;idered, its purity, its friendly a&s;pect on the public religious liberty, and its utility to the &s;tate. I am per&s;uaded from a very thorough di&s;qui&s;ition and &s;earch, that there is no body of churches in the pro|te&s;tant world more nearly recovered to the &s;implicity and purity of the apo&s;tolic age. We need indeed &s;ome further purifications and amendments; which will doubtle&s;s take
<PB N="96" REF="009018_0095_10306F05C7CA6A50">
place in proce&s;s of time on free inquiry and univer&s;al li|berty, to the prevailing of which it is already impo&s;&s;ible to put a &s;top. But in general our churches appear to me to be nearly on the &s;ame footing with the primitive chur|ches, as left by the apo&s;tles, who doubtle&s;s left them com|pletely in&s;tituted. Mo&s;t other prote&s;tant churches are under embarra&s;&s;ments from which we are free. If there be more liberty for free inquiry at pre&s;ent in &s;ome of them, it does not flow from the nature of their policy, but from the laudable moderation of their clergy, or other le&s;s honorable motives&mdash;And be&s;ides, the avenues to this liberty are embarra&s;&s;ed with di&s;honorable compliances and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions. Any embarra&s;&s;ments in our churches procede not from the nature of their policy, but from the &s;pirit of the times, which mu&s;t and will alter. If there be any true way of wor&s;hipping the deity, the &s;upreme Lord of nature, it may be in our manner: even dei&s;ts mu&s;t confe&s;s that our way is or may be natural and rational. And being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the precious jewel of religious liberty, a jewel of ine&s;timable worth, let us prize it highly, and e&s;teem it too dear to be parted with on any terms; le&s;t we be again entangled with that yoke of bondage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">STAR-CHAMBER and HIGH COMMISSION.</NOTE> which our fathers could not, would not. and God grant we may never &s;ubmit to bear. The le&s;&s;er differences among our|&s;elves, which will at times unavoidably &s;pring up in this imperfect militant &s;tate, and afford a temporary di&s;turbance to the be&s;t con&s;tituted churches, will again &s;ub&s;ide, and finally terminate in defining the limits of power, and in more accurately a&s;certaining the terms of communion and univer&s;al benevolence. Providence has planted the bri|ti&s;h America with a variety of &s;ects, which will unavoidably become a mutual balance upon one another. Their temporary colli&s;ions, like the action of acids and alcalies after a &s;hort ebullition, will &s;ub&s;ide in harmony and union, not by the de&s;truction of either, but in the friendly coha|bitation
<PB N="97" REF="009018_0096_10306F0D6FFCAB00">
of all. An antecedent fermentation may take place, as it his done in the philo&s;ophic world, but generous inquiry and liberal di&s;qui&s;ition will i&s;&s;ue all in this. Re|&s;plendent and all-prevailing TRUTH will terminate the whole in univer&s;al harmony. All &s;urreptitious efforts and attempts on the public liberty will unavoidably excite the public vigilance of the &s;ects, till the terms of general com|munion be defined and honorably adju&s;ted. The notion of erecting the polity of either &s;ect into univer&s;al do|minion to the de&s;truction of the re&s;t, is but an airy vi&s;ion &mdash;may &s;erve to inflame a tempory enthu&s;ia&s;m&mdash;but can never &s;uccede&mdash;all the pre&s;ent &s;ects will &s;ub&s;i&s;t &amp; increa&s;e into di&s;tinct re&s;pectable bodies, continuing their di&s;tinctions for a long time yet to come in full life and vigor. In|deed mutual oppre&s;&s;ion will more and more &s;ub&s;ide from their mutual balance of one another. Union may &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the&s;e di&s;tinctions, coale&s;cence only on the &s;amene&s;s of public &s;entiment, which can again be effected in the chri&s;|tian world only by the gentle, but almighty power of truth. It has been effected in pa&s;t ages, but can never be effected again on the former mea&s;ures&mdash;&s;o great an altera|tion is made among mankind by &s;cience and letters. The &s;ects cannot de&s;troy one another: all attempts this way will be fruitle&s;s&mdash;they may affect a tempory di&s;turbance, but cannot produce a di&s;&s;olution&mdash;each one &s;ub&s;erves the mutual &s;ecurity of all. The advantages taken by any one &s;ect over the &s;ecurity and indolence, or inte&s;tine broils of another, will &s;oon e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o' awaken its &s;en&s;ibility or mode|ration, and excite the &s;pirit of &s;elf-defence&mdash;and &s;o for the whole. Such is human nature, e&s;pecially enlightened with the pure light of revelation and &s;ciences. Nothing however will content us but actual experiment&mdash;this expe|riment will be made in one century, and then perhaps we &s;hall be &s;atisfied. But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In order to perceive what particular &s;ect is mo&s;t friendly to the public liberty, we need only take a &s;urvey of the
<PB N="98" REF="009018_0097_10306F107A36A620">
religious e&s;tabli&s;hments in the &s;everal briti&s;h provinces on this continent. That civil e&s;tabli&s;hment is friendly to li|berty, which either ve&s;ts all &s;ects with equal immunities, or &s;ecures each &s;ect from being obliged directly or indi|rectly to contribute to the public &s;upport of others be&s;ides them&s;elves. Where all &s;ects are equally e&s;tabli&s;hed there is properly no <HI>toleration,</HI> all partaking in the benefit of the e&s;tabli&s;hment. Where one &s;ect is inve&s;ted with power to enforce taxes on them&s;elves for the &s;upport of their clergy, and all others exempted from &s;uch tax, there is a true and proper toleration, but perfectly ea&s;y as &s;uch di&s;&s;enters are exempted from mini&s;terial taxes. Where the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy are &s;upported by a branch of provincial revenues appropriated, and di&s;&s;enters are not exempted from con|tributing, and yet &s;hare no part of &s;uch appropriation, &s;uch di&s;&s;enters are tolerated in the lowe&s;t &s;en&s;e, viz. on condi|tion of their payment to the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy. And it may &s;o happen that the &s;ame &s;ects may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, or di&s;&s;enters in different provinces. So a &s;cots presbyterian is a di&s;&s;enter in England, and an epi&s;copalian a di&s;&s;enter in Scotland. Let us now take a view of the provincial e&s;tabli&s;hments. In <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> it is epi&s;copacy, tho' the public believe it to be equal prote&s;tant liberty. In <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut,</HI> made under the influence of congregationali&s;ts, it is <HI>congregationali&s;m</HI>&mdash; but all other &s;ects are exempted from taxes for the &s;upport of the congregational clergy. The mini&s;terial taxes of this &s;ect are enforceable at law&mdash;this is the principal ad|vantage they enjoy above the di&s;&s;enters in tho&s;e provinces. In <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> it is univer&s;al equal prote&s;tant liberty, no &s;ect being enabled to enforce their mini&s;terial contracts at law. In <HI>New-York</HI> epi&s;copacy is e&s;tabli&s;hed for the four fir&s;t counties, where all di&s;&s;enters, mini&s;ters and peo|ple are obliged to pay to the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy, except &s;o far as the Dutch churches in virtue of an original &s;tipu|lation gained an exemption and e&s;tabli&s;hment. For the
<PB N="99" REF="009018_0098_10306F134D6A6708">
other counties of that province it is univer&s;al liberty. The religious e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Jer&s;ies</HI> and <HI>Pen&s;ylva|nia</HI> is univer&s;al liberty as in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land.</HI> In <HI>Mary|land</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> it is <HI>epi&s;copacy,</HI> with appropriations of large revenu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from tobacco for the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy only. And tho' a very con&s;iderable part of tho&s;e two provinces, according to Dr. Dougla&s;s and others, are presbyterian and other di&s;&s;enters, who contribute proportionably to this ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical revenue, yet they are not allowed to &s;hare the lea&s;t part of its appropriation. As to the three &s;outhern provinces, their climate not &s;uiting european con&s;titutions, they will not figure as to numbers for perhaps yet a centu|ry or more, untill the pre&s;ent race is hardned and get the better of a noxious region. Epi&s;copacy however is in effect their e&s;tabli&s;hment, or perhaps will be in time: But with this only difference at pre&s;ent, that the epi&s;copalians in South Carolina have gained of the legi&s;lature an appro|priation of certain duties on leather and &s;kins. Excepting their proportion in this, the other prote&s;tant &s;ects are not yet obliged to contribute to the &s;upport of the epi&s;copal clergy in tho&s;e three provinces.</P>
<P>From this view it appears, that in virtue of the religious e&s;tabli&s;hment in the three provinces of Pen&s;ylvania, the Jer&s;eys and <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> there are no di&s;&s;enters, but all enjoy the &s;ame common immunities; excepting that &s;ome few Dutch and perhaps other churches in the Jer&s;ies are created bodies corporate by patents obtained from the go|vernors. But the happy policy of e&s;tabli&s;hing one &s;ect without infringing the e&s;&s;ential rights of others is peculiar to the three New England provinces, where <HI>congregati|onali&s;m</HI> is the e&s;tabli&s;hment, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CONGREGATIONALISTS are not DISSENTERS in New England.</NOTE> with re&s;pect to two of which It is &s;aid to be confirmed by the royal a&s;&s;ent. Now tho' our churches and congregations are endowed with parochial immunities, yet all not of our denomination, and particu|larly the epi&s;copalian, are exempted from parochial taxes to
<PB N="100" REF="009018_0099_10302EA665296998">
the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy&mdash;for what is collected of epi&s;copali|ans in parochial a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments is paid to the epi&s;copal incum|bent&mdash;a favor which our numerous brethren the di&s;&s;enters at home have never gained. Nor is any &s;uch favor grant|ed to our brethren the presbyterians in Maryland and Vir|ginia, who&s;e religious e&s;tabli&s;hment was made under epi&s;|copal influence.&mdash;But where we have power we grant li|berty &s;o abundantly, that even in tho&s;e parts of New England where congregationali&s;m is the legal e&s;tabli&s;hment, other &s;ects &s;carcely know that they are tolerated di&s;&s;en|ters, &s;o happy and mild in our dominion. When by the e&s;tabli&s;hment all the members of a community are by law obliged to contribute to the &s;upport of the clergy of one &s;ect, whether in parochial taxes or <HI>appropriated revenues,</HI> all the other &s;ects &s;uffer in their e&s;&s;ential liberties. When every &s;ect is free of one another, or proportionably &s;hare the public revenues and offices, their e&s;&s;ential liberties are intire. Congregationali&s;m being endowed with parochial powers over its own members only, does not in the lea&s;t interfere with the e&s;&s;ential liberties of the other &s;ects. And further it is to be ob&s;erved, that the peculiar tenets of any religious prote&s;tant &s;ect is not made a religious te&s;t of holding civil or military offices in Pen&s;ylvania, the Jer&s;ies and New England.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that congregationali&s;m is friendly, I will not &s;ay more &s;o, but as friendly as any other &s;ect to the public liberty civil and religious; and does not in the lea&s;t interfere with the liberty and e&s;&s;ential rights of other &s;ect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. And be&s;ides, our peculiar forms do not prevent our di&s;tingui&s;hed loyalty to our &s;overeign&mdash;for we may boldly &s;ay his maje&s;ty has not a body of more loyal and well affected &s;ubjects in his dominions. All the New England &s;ects are loyal; but the principles of loyalty to the illu&s;tri|ous hou&s;e of Hanover are inculcated on the people by the congregational clergy with peculiar &s;incerity, faithful|ne&s;s and con&s;tancy.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="009018_0100_10302EA976944A40">Again, our churches are well calculated for the good of a chri&s;tian &s;tate. There are two ends of churches in a &s;tate, <HI>in&s;truction in chri&s;tianity,</HI> and the <HI>public offices of religion.</HI> Both the&s;e, and e&s;pecially the former, are as well performed in New England as in any part of the prote&s;tant world. And perhaps the numerous body of our denomination may be ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed for the popular ac|quaintance with the &s;acred writings, &amp; knowledge both of the hi&s;tories and great doctrines of revelation. Our clergy are not expen&s;ive, nor are our people burdened with tenths, nor have we intrigued the eccle&s;ia&s;tical appropriation of enormous impoveri&s;hing revenues. The landed e&s;tate in England is computed at 20 millions per annum: of which 14 millions per annum were dependent on the clergy at the reformation. In the time of <HI>Louis</HI> XIV. the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues of France were 26 millions &s;terling, when at the &s;ame time the civil revenue did not exceed 13 millions. The le&s;s expen&s;ive the clergy, if a people be well in&s;tructed and the publick offices of religion faithfully and decently performed, the better for a &s;tate, becau&s;e the richer the people: and it is ea&s;ier to rai&s;e a &s;um for pub|lic exigencies on an opulent people, than on an opulent hierarchy. Be&s;ides, eccle&s;ia&s;tical opulence gives the clergy a weight, which is apt to affect the civil admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>It gives me peculiar plea&s;ure that notwith&s;tanding their many imperfections, our churches afford &s;uch an agreeable review with re&s;pect to <HI>purity, liberty,</HI> and <HI>utility.</HI> For the fir&s;t, we are nearly recovered to the purity of the primitive apo&s;tolic churches&mdash;for the &s;econd, we oppre&s;s no other &s;ect&mdash;for the la&s;t, the popular knowledge of revelation, the decency and &s;olemnity of our public offices of religion witne&s;s for us. And our imperfections admit amendment on our pre&s;ent polity. We have rea&s;on to ble&s;s God, that when the church was intirely corrupted in the papacy, he rai&s;ed up and &s;pirited the reformation. But to me it ap|pears, that he has re&s;erved the honor of a mo&s;t purified

reformation for our churches in New-England. It is truly important that this vine, which God hath planted with a mighty hand in this american wilderne&s;s, &s;hould be cultivated into confirmed maturity. You are very &s;en&s;ible, that there is a formal attempt on the cha&s;tity and order of our churches, which is vigilantly to be guarded again&s;t, at pre&s;ent, till our churches grow into one cemented, large, pure, defen&s;ible body. It is incumbent upon u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atch and guard their infancy with a paternal godlike fidelity. God has betru&s;ted us with a part to act for po&s;terity and the public; let us not &s;upinely de&s;ert it, but act it well, con&s;ecrate and tran&s;mit the purity of religion to generations yet unborn. It is evident nothing tends more to enervate and moulder down our cau&s;e, than differences and animo|&s;ities: nothing tends to &s;trengthen and font it to defen&s;ible maturity like union and benevolence. If we have any public benevolence, any bowels of compa&s;&s;ion, any tender affection for pure and undefiled religion&mdash;by the tender mercies of Jehovah! by the love of Je&s;us!&mdash;let us bury and lay a&s;ide our trifling differences, and harmoniou&s;ly unite in carrying on and perfecting the one &s;ame great and noble work.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd argument for union may be taken from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our churches. There is no body of chri&s;tians on earth in &s;uch a rapid increa&s;e, and in &s;o flou|ri&s;hing a &s;tate, as the congregationali&s;ts of New-England. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of our denomination as to numbers, for the year 1760, is nearly this&mdash;in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts are above 300 congregational churches&mdash;in Connecticut 170&mdash;in New-Hamp&s;hire 43&mdash;which, with tho&s;e in this colony, form a body of about 530 churches, In 1650 there were about 36 churches already founded, &s;everal of which were &s;mall beginnings, requiring many years to fill up. In 1696 were but 130 congregational churches in all New-England. And being A. D. 1760 increa&s;ed to 530. the proportion of doubling is once in 30 years. A. D. 1613 there had
<PB N="103" REF="009018_0102_10302EACC7A536E0">
arrived is 298 tran&s;ports, about 4200 planters with their families, making about 21,200 people for all New-Eng|land <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sion's Saviour in N. E. p. 31.</NOTE>. Since that time more have gone from us to Eu|rope, than have arrived from thence hither. The pre&s;ent inhabitants therefore of New-England, are ju&s;tly to be e&s;timated a natural increa&s;e by the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven on the fir&s;t 21,000 that arrived by the year 1643.</P>
<P>In new &s;etled countries the tran&s;planted colonies, by an e&s;tabli&s;hed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of nature, in a good climate, do increa&s;e to a certain <HI>patrial</HI> maturity, when they begin to decline. At the beginning of this increa&s;e the period of doubling is very &s;hort, and the augmentation rapid&mdash;afterward the period of doubling is extended till it gradually cea&s;es, and is &s;ucceeded with a diminution, &s;low at fir&s;t, but rapid at la&s;t. The period of <HI>patrial maturity,</HI> as well as of <HI>patrial doubling</HI> doubtle&s;s in &s;ome mea&s;ure corre&s;ponds to the nature of the climate:&mdash;the former in our climate may have been about 1000 or 1200 years; the latter 20 or 25 years. The period of rapid patrial doubling in 25 years may reach its akme in one third of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> requi|&s;ite to the final Akme of increa&s;e. The ratio of patrial doubling continues equable for 3 or 400 years, when in con&s;equence of another law of nature, this ratio begins at once to be greatly extended. Po&s;terity alone can more accurately a&s;certain the&s;e things. If we look into hi&s;tory we may perhaps be inclined to judge the period of patrial maturity about 800 or 1000 years, perhaps more than le&s;s. It is probable that the colonies tran&s;planted from Shinar into Egypt&mdash;and from Egypt afterwards into Greece, came to the maturity of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lite&s;t ages about this period. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation may hold of the Tyrian colonies at Carthage. Rather more certainly we know that the fugi|tives from Troy peopled Italy at this period. The few trojan exiles, who were tran&s;ported in &s;even &s;mall &s;hips, arrived into Italy, according to Livy about 430 years be|fore
<PB N="104" REF="009018_0103_10302EAFF6ABAE88">
the foundation of Rome. And it is probable the Romans had their akme of natural increa&s;e before U. C. 650, that is within about 1100 years after their fir&s;t plan|tation in Italy. But mo&s;t certainly of all, we know that the 70 &s;ouls, which &s;prang from JACOB's loins, when tran&s;planted into Egypt grew and multiplied in about 215 years to 603,550 &s;en&s;ible men of 20 years and upwards, exclu&s;ive of the levites: which, con&s;idering the young men under 20 years, may imply above 3 million &s;ouls, an in|crea&s;e on 70 &s;ouls only in 215 years. It is true, this public cen&s;us was made above a year after the exodus, but we are given to under&s;tand that there was no increa&s;e in the wilderne&s;s. This is an unparralleled increa&s;e! the period of doubling being about 14 years.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph was 17 years old when he was &s;old into Egypt. He was 30 at his advancement: 8 years after this Jacob came into Egypt with his family; after which Jo&s;eph lived 72 years and died at the age of 110. I&s;rael came out of Egypt 143 years after Jo&s;eph's death and 215 after Jacob's coming into Egypt. Mo&s;es was born 63 or 64 years after Jo&s;eph's death, &s;pent 40 years at Pharaoh's court and 40 years in exile in Midian; and at his return mu&s;t have found I&s;rael increa&s;ed in 40 years from about 400,000 to about 3 millions. Upon the view of the ho&s;ts of I&s;rael after his return from exile <Q>thy fathers went down into Egypt with three &s;core and ten per&s;ons; and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the &s;tars of heaven for multitude.</Q> All the &s;ouls that came out of Jacob's loins, exclu&s;ive of his &s;on's wives, were 70 at his arrival and &s;ettlement in Egypt. If the period of doubling continued equable during the whole term of 215 years, the numbers of increa&s;e may be thus exhibited,

The males of the tribe of Levi were 22,000 at the exodus, and &s;o the whole tribe about 40,000 (the males of 30 aet. were 38,000 in David's time)&mdash;which if augmented with the common national increa&s;e, and added to the preceding numbers, may give 9 millions and an half for the total of &s;ouls of the Hebrews about the times of David and Solomon.

Though their numbers might continue much the &s;ame till beyond Jeho&s;aphat's times, and e&s;pecially during Solomon's reign when the nation was at its &s;ummit of glory, both for numbers, riches, policy and union: yet it is probable they had reached the akme or height of patrial increa&s;e even before David.

<P>Hence it appears that without con&s;idering the augmen|tation of future acce&s;&s;ions from Europe, each of the four principal &s;ects in New England may greatly increa&s;e into large and re&s;pectable bodies, even with the mo&s;t &s;anguine allowances for pro&s;eliting. The natural increa&s;e on the pre&s;ent &s;tock will in half a century give 46,400 for the epi&s;copalians, 64,000 for the friends, 88,000 for the bapti&s;ts, and one million and three quarters for the con|gregationali&s;ts. And in a century 185,600 for the fir&s;t, 256000 for the &s;econd, 352000 for the third, and &s;even millions for the la&s;t. I &s;hall not enter into the variations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch may ari&s;e on the&s;e numbers in this period from pro&s;eliting and &s;hifting communions, though we have &s;uffi|cient data to form pretty certain anticipations on this head.</P>
<P>The difficulty of breaking the ance&s;torial religion, un|le&s;s the public enthu&s;ia&s;m be excited, appears not only from the &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion made on the &s;ects here, where the amount of changes may not perhaps excede 5000 among all the &s;ects: but al&s;o from the &s;mall impre&s;&s;ions made on the &s;ects in Germany and other parts of the prote&s;tant world with regard to their general forms&mdash;and particularly on the Iri&s;h catholics, when the re&s;ult of the labors of a much longer period is &s;aid not to have gained 200,000 prote&s;tants, excepting the north of Ireland Scots pre&s;|byterians.

The authors of the &s;y&s;tem of geography &s;ay, <Q>it is computed that about 8 parts in 10 are papi&s;ts, and that the di&s;&s;enters are double the memebers of the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment.</Q> It is to be hoped that the next capital change will be to a &s;till greater purity both in doctrine and wor&s;hip. Our final dependence for the &s;ecurity and protection of truth is in the irre&s;i&s;table dominion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who will eventually &s;ubdue all things to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent the congregationali&s;ts have about 515 churches already gathered, which double in le&s;s than 30 years. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to Dr. Dougla&s;s the Number of our Churches A. D. 1759, was 407. Summary Hi&s;t. V. I. 542.</NOTE> So that 60 years hence we may con&s;i&s;t of 2000 churches; a remarkable increa&s;e, which &s;ome of the pre|&s;ent generation may live to &s;ee. The aged mini&s;ters now living, have in their day &s;een 130 churches increa&s;e to 530. In a century from this time we may have 5000 churches, even with allowances for emigrations to new provinces. But in order to this the love of liberty, and a zeal for pure and undefiled religion mu&s;t be diffu&s;ed and propagated with unremitted fidelity and vigilance. Should our inte&s;tine di&s;&s;entions unhinge the minds of the ri&s;ing generations, and di&s;engage or render them indifferent to the cau&s;e, it might be attended with unhappy con&s;equences. Union and diffu&s;ive harmony are truly important, during this infancy of the churches, and this period of rapid in|crea&s;e. The error of Balaam in the &s;nare he laid for I&s;rael, effectually wrought a confu&s;ion, from which omni|potence alone could recover them. Let us not be caught by any &s;imilar error. If we adhere to our principles, even the undefiled, the uncorrupted principles of revela|tion, with the utmo&s;t charity and benevolence to others, and without encroaching upon, or intefering with, the pe|culiarities of our prote&s;tant brethren of the other &s;ects, if we are and continue united in faith and fellow&s;hip&mdash; providence is advancing us in a &s;wift progre&s;s to figure and defen&s;ible maturity. The pre&s;ent increa&s;ing &s;tate

of our churches, and the dependence of their future glory on harmonious union in their increa&s;ing infancy, appear to me a very powerful recommendation to walk together by the &s;ame rules, in love and harmony, &s;o far as we have attained and attentively to <HI>mind the &s;ame thimg;</HI> that is, our&s;elves to re&s;pect, and to teach our children to mind the &s;ame great intere&s;t of the &s;ame common cau&s;e&mdash;never to defect it, but faithfully pur&s;ue it: that the public &s;pirit be animated, guided and governed by the <HI>&s;ame</HI> public princi|ples which are our common intere&s;t. It ought particularly to be inculcated upon our friends going from us to the &s;ettlement of new towns or provinces, to carry religion with them, to <HI>&s;ettle early in church order, and furni&s;h them|&s;elves with a mini&s;try of the word and ordinances, for the benefit of them&s;elves and their children.</HI> Great encou|ragement &s;hould be given to our colleges and nur&s;eries of literature, which grow more and more important every day. We &s;hould often relate to our po&s;terity the hi&s;tory of the wonderful providences of God in the &s;ettlement of this country; and remark the growth of our churches, and engage them by all the honorable motives of chri&s;tianity to &s;teadfa&s;tne&s;s in the faith once delivered to the &s;aints, and in the liberty wherewith the go&s;pel has made us free. Let our children be often taught to read the &s;ixth, &s;eventh, eighth, and ninth ver&s;es of the twenty-&s;ixth chapter of Deuteronomy with parallel application to the hi&s;tory of our ance&s;tors. Let the great errand into America never be forgotten.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The plantation of Plymouth colony con&s;i&s;ted of 300 &s;ouls A. D. 1629; when the principal draught of our fathers from the mother country commenced the &s;ettlement of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. And in the 10 following years there were 21 churches gathered. About 16 churches planted by the time of the fir&s;t &s;ynod 1637, at which were pre&s;ent 25 mini&s;ters. I have ob&s;erved that there were arrived by A. D. 1643 about 2000 planters, be&s;ides 200 gentlemen of for|tune, merchants and mini&s;ters: which have been judged to imply 21,200 &s;ouls. The fir&s;t Plymouth &s;ettlement, A. D. 1620. con|&s;i&s;ted of 41 planters and but 101 &s;ouls, of which there were only 18 wives: and I &s;uppo&s;e in all the future acce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, there was a large proportion of adventurers &s;ingle men without families. The Ld. Trea&s;urer's order, April 16, 1629. was for 60 adult females, 26 children and 300 men. A. D 1644 the militia of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts con&s;i&s;ted of 26 bands, or perhaps 2600 &s;oldiers, which if but a &s;eventh part, imply but about 16 000 &s;ouls: but probably the militia bore a greater proportion, if the males exceded the females. The re&s;toration of the ballance of the &s;exes might require that the fir&s;t 15 or 20 years increa&s;e, &s;hould con&s;i&s;t chiefly of female children. From &s;everal computations of this nature I have been inclined to be|lieve, that the fir&s;t 4000 planters did not imply above 15,000 &s;ouls to have arrived by A. D. 1643; which were cantoned into 34 churches by A. D 1645. increa&s;ed to about 40 churches by A. D. 1650&mdash;when they contained 7750 communicants. Perhaps there may now be 60 or 70 thou&s;and communicants. There were 130 churches A. D. 1696, of which 35 in Connecticut: there are A. D. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0. 530 churches, of which 170 in Connecticut. Hence the pe|riod of doubling for the churches is 30 years at farthe&s;t. In 115 years we have increa&s;ed 500 churches upon 34.&mdash;This is the LORD's doings, and it is marvellous in our eyes! Perhaps the multiplication of the primitive churches did not excede this in the fir&s;t 130 years from the crucifixion And it is to be remembered, that of the fir&s;t planters two churches are not reckoned, which were &s;ettled on <HI>Long-I&s;land.</HI> The numbers of the planters might be accurately a&s;certained by having recour&s;e to the records of the fir&s;t 30 or 40 towns. I have ob&s;erved, that as we are above 500 churches at pre&s;ent, &s;o we may by the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven become above 1000 in 30. and 2000 in 60 years The renowned church of Scotland con&s;i&s;ts of 938 churches&mdash; tho&s;e of the Dutch and Walloon, A. D. 1560. con&s;i&s;ted of 2190 churches: to either of which we may be equal in 60 or 70 years.</P>
<P>And while we are anticipating the Growth and Multiplication of our churches in New England&mdash;we may with plea&s;ure extend the Pro&s;pect to our brethren the presbyterian churches in the other provinces. The wi&s;e and happy junction of the two &s;ynods of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> and New-York, A. D. 1758. formed a coalition of above 100 Pa&s;tors with their churches under the rapid augmentation of the lite natural in|crea&s;e with ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. In the province of Penn&s;ylvania, inclu&s;ive of the three Delaware counties, are 66 congregations, of which 41 are de&s;titute of Pa&s;tors. Our brethren are &s;till more numerous in pro|portion in the province of New-Jer&s;ey, and I think al&s;o in that of New-York. And there is a very con&s;iderable body of them in the frontiers of Maryland and Virginia, where they have already a pre&s;|bytery formed. Al&s;o in New-York and Jer&s;ey are two c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us of our prote&s;tant brethren the <HI>Dutch reformed,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of 20 mini&s;ters: al&s;o two churches of French prote&s;tants; and 3 congregational churches. All the&s;e are peculiarly &s;i&s;ter churches, with whom we have an intire harmony and fellow&s;hip. Dr. Dougla&s;s &s;ays, "the three frontier counties in Virginia of <HI>Frederic.

Tho' there are many vacant churches, which the colleges are &s;upplying a pace, yet the <HI>eight</HI> pre&s;byteries, at the union of the &s;ynods in May 1758 con&s;i&s;ted of 100 mini&s;ters.

What pro&s;perity attended God's people when they turned to the Lord and united in his ways? The whole treatment of divine providence towards that people from Mo&s;es to this day, has been exactly according to the 28th chapter of Deuteronomy. And excepting in one thing, there may be an analogy between the divine treatment of this and all other &s;tates, e&s;pecially his conduct towards that kingdom wherein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s. We may then reap great advantage in con&s;ulting and duly ap|plying that hi&s;tory, which may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure typical of our own.

<P>I have ob&s;erved that our churches, in a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;en&s;e from almo&s;t all the prote&s;tant world, are founded on the bible. Our worthy and venerable ance&s;tors (be their memories dear to po&s;terity) did not like other prote&s;tant patrons, form a &s;y&s;tem of what they thought and judged to be the true &s;en&s;e of revelation, and e&s;tabli&s;h this for the truth:&mdash;no&mdash;it was eno' for them that the bible was the in&s;pired rule, and this they made the only rule.

The computations with re&s;pect to their future growth depend, by the leave of providence, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that we have room to extend our &s;ettlements. Agriculture and the rural life are peculiarly friendly to increa&s;e. Ten thou&s;and families (not of an old, but even of a new race, which makes a great difference) with means of affluent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, dwelling together in a populous herd, kept from vices but employed in handycraft indu&s;try; will by no means equal the increa&s;e, which the &s;ame number of families would afford if turned forth and di&s;per&s;ed in the wide world and employed in agriculture in a new climate: there is a difference from the employments, but the chief difference is from change of climate, di&s;&s;ipation and the rural air. Farmers find it nece&s;&s;ary to change their &s;eed-corn, and &s;hift their herds and &s;tocks. Hillocks of corn planted near together yield not half the increa&s;e, as when planted at proper di&s;tances on the &s;ame ground. The pre&s;ent bounds of New England (the greater part of which is yet a wilderne&s;s) permit an increa&s;e of &s;even millions.

One thing which in 20 or 30 years time will be found to give a &s;en&s;ible &s;hock to New England emigrations, will be the quitrents on new provinces.

A reciprocation of intere&s;t as well as affection to an exiled and long di&s;pi&s;ed offspring, has doubtle&s;s engaged the mother country in our defence. The importations from thence to the continental provinces only, are already arrived to two millions &s;terling per annum; this is as much as the pre&s;ent numbers will con&s;ume. This importation may increa&s;e with the inhabitants, if effectual encouragement be given to the fi&s;hery, to the foreign trade, and the &s;everal provincial &s;taples in which remittances can be made. From 1744 to 1754 the importation de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ded: from 1748 to 1758 it more than doubled. But if in&s;tead of 10 years we &s;uppo&s;e it next to double only in 25 years, or with the natural increa&s;e of the peo|ple, the amount will be 34 millions &s;terling for the fir&s;t period, and proportionably greater for the next.

<P>Thus I have con&s;idered the &s;econd argument for union taken from the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of the churches. I might have enlarged upon the unhappy con&s;equences of contentions and di&s;union, by &s;hewing more particularly how they mu&s;t, or might terminate in the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of the congregational intere&s;t; which might &s;hew in ano|ther &s;trong light the wi&s;dom of coalition and harmony. To &s;um up this argument&mdash;if we love the cau&s;e; if it gives us plea&s;ure to be embarked in a cau&s;e which has Je&s;us Chri&s;t for its head and omnipotent patron, and which under him we can fore&s;ee is ri&s;ing into di&s;tinction; ought we not with &s;incere affection to unite and harmonize, &s;ince this union is the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of its ri&s;ing into re&s;pectable figure?</P>
<P N="3">3. And la&s;tly. I ju&s;t add a la&s;t rea&s;on for union, which more immediately affects every one in his individual capa|city,

that it will afford a field for the exerci&s;e of angelic benevolence and complacency. We can look upon the cau&s;e, upon the &s;tate of the churches, with a complacency, which cannot be felt in &s;urveying inte&s;tine confu&s;ion. How good &amp; plea&s;ant a thing is it for brethren to dwell together in unity. Living in peace and harmony tends irre&s;i&s;tably to humanize and &s;often the mind to the mo&s;t generous and god-like feelings&mdash;delights unknown to &s;ectarian contention or in|te&s;tine variance. It is a very happy circum&s;tance to be &s;ituated among a friendly &s;ocial people, we are in&s;en&s;ibly caught of the benevolence which union and peace diffu&s;es. The public love and harmony will enable us with &s;erenity and more &s;acred &s;atisfaction to celebrate the offices of piety and devotion. Our religious addre&s;&s;es and joyful homage undi&s;turbed, unpolluted with the reluctant feelings of va|riance, &s;hall a&s;cend as incen&s;e holy and acceptable to the Mo&s;t High. And in common life, in&s;tead of broken friend&s;hips, and family alienations, we &s;hould become united brethren in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, harmoniou&s;ly travelling along together, and &s;weetning the trials of life with the animat|ing complacency of &s;ocial virtue. Religious conte&s;ts are apt to &s;our the temper, which is greatly unhappy in a &s;tate preparatory to the communion of angels and glorious beings above. The complacency and love for virtuous minds, like all other moral affections are formed, at lea&s;t &s;trength|ened by previous di&s;cipline. If we have lived in &s;erenity and a&s;&s;ociated with the good here, we &s;hall have acquired the principle of &s;piritual delight in good beings, which qualifies the &s;oul to be gathered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;craphs, and to be a&s;&s;ociated with the purified and refined &s;pirits of the upper world.

Let us accu&s;tom our&s;elves to take an annual view, and carefully attend to the public exigencies of the churches in the progre&s;s of increa&s;e or decline. Let us often tell the&s;e things to our children, that with their own eyes they may &s;ee and admire the wonder-working provi|dence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od. That when they are convinced from an in&s;pection of the ways of God, that the cau&s;e they are embarked in flouri&s;hes and is &s;ecure, and appears evident|ly emerging &s;uperior to all oppo&s;ition, they may give glory to God and take courage, never de&s;ert the cau&s;e, but ad|here firm and unmoved. I am in no doubt, as I have before &s;aid, but that the con&s;titution and general form of our churches is very nearly apo&s;tolical. And tho' there are imperfections remaining&mdash;yet they are much more ea&s;ily amended than in any other prote&s;tant church, as amend|ments would not be encountered with the like oppo&s;ition of authorities and unwieldy temporalities. If we oppre&s;s any, it is our&s;elves only; our churches, and the &s;ecular power too much at their command, formerly adopted tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, which are always recollect with regret, and di&s;|approbation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such were the mea&s;ures of 1637, 1656, 1692.</NOTE>.

And as by our principles we are not led to per&s;ecute others, &s;o let us entertain a manly charity for our prote&s;tant brethren of all denominations, rejoicing that they are to a very great de|gree reformed: and as we believe they re&s;pectively judge them&s;elves, each more than others reformed to the &s;crip|ture rule; &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> exten&s;ive charity and comprehen&s;ive be|nevolence, is no ways incon&s;i&s;tent with our given the pre|ference to <HI>congregationali&s;m.</HI> We rejoice that men may become good and holy in all communions:&mdash;it will be admitted that in different communions there may be dif|ferent advantages for virtue and piety; and though we

think that our churches have the preference in this, as well as in being re&s;embled to primitive &s;cripture model as to the ordinances and forms of wor&s;hip&mdash;yet we doubt not the pious dying from every communion will be re|ceived to glory. We are not &s;o bigotted as to think that the tender mercies of the Lord are limited to us, and that none can be &s;aved out of our churches. We rejoice to &s;ee men of virtue and true goodne&s;s; and it gives us plea|&s;ure to view tho&s;e per&s;ons as ornaments of the communions to which they belong, though different from ours. In&s;tead of wi&s;hing the extirpation of any &s;ect, we wi&s;h them all well and to abound in the knowledge and practice of chri&s;tianity, and to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on truth and honor. We &s;tand firm and fa&s;t to the con&s;titution of liberty in our churches &mdash;and as we do not oppre&s;s others, &s;o we hope not to be oppre&s;&s;ed by others. On the footing of equality and uni|ver&s;al liberty we are friends to all, but &s;ubmit not to be &s;ubordinate to any. Having &s;ecured and fortified our own cau&s;e, we may &s;it down full of a joyful &s;elf-complacency, and look around on our chri&s;tian brethren of the other &s;ects, not with a view of &s;owing the &s;eeds of di&s;cord, not to avail our&s;elves of their differences, lea&s;t of all to per|&s;ecute and oppre&s;s them; but to exerci&s;e good-will and &s;incere chri&s;tian love to them, to let off the emanations of benevolence towards all that fear God and work righte|ou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>We &s;ee my brethren, the arguments are &s;trong for the congregational union in every point of view. There are &s;ome peculiar rea&s;ons why the congregational brethren and churches in this colony &s;hould be united. Our cau&s;e is one, and a cau&s;e not in decline, not in di&s;repute, but in honor and a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing pro&s;perity. Let us be cemented together by forbearance, fellow&s;hip, union.

Let us teach for doctrines not the in&s;titutes of men, but the pure word of God, that our congregations may grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It will be our wi&s;dom to be united our&s;elves, and to that end to avoid every thing by which we may unnece&s;|&s;arily offend one another.

We &s;hall thus act the part a&s;&s;igned us by providence under the general dominion of the mediator. We &s;hould account our&s;elves happy in being charged with the mini&s;try of reconciliation under the prince of peace. Let us make full proof of our mini&s;try:&mdash;be the glory of God in the reconciliation of men the great object of our attention.

<P>In the year 1760 died 10 of the pa&s;tors; 18 ordained, including one in&s;talment; and 6 new churches gathered, who&s;e pari&s;hes are included in this li&s;t. At the end of the year, I think there are 15 of the&s;e parochial congregations who&s;e churches are not formed, viz. 10 for Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and 5 for Connecticut. So that while the total of parochial congregations is 530, the total of churches is 515 for the end of the year 1760. If the total of churches in 1749 was but 407, as Dr. Dougla&s;s a&s;&s;erts, we have multiplied 108 churches in 12 years.</P>
