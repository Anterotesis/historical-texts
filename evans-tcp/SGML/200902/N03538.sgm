<HEAD>A TREATISE Concerning <HI>MARRIAGE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MARRIAGE is an Ordinance of God, as old as &s;ince our fir&s;t Parents, in&s;tituted in Paradi&s;e, for their comfortable abiding here, and leaving Po&s;terity after them; and Men and Women have been the more happy therein, as they have had Regard to the Coun&s;el of God, and his Providential Hand, in cho&s;ing &s;uch as feared the Lord, and were true Wor|&s;hippers of him; and avoiding tho&s;e who were Idolaters, and &s;uch as feared not the true God.</P>
<P>And that in &s;uch their Caution, their Proceeding was agreeable to the Law of God in the Heart, is very apparent: for
<PB N="4" REF="004322_0003_100414D5C9385A00">when the Will and Mind of God was committed to Writing, and promulga|ted to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> his peculiar People, <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. &s;peaking of the Nations who inhabi|ted the promi&s;ed Land, he &s;aid, <HI>Neither &s;halt thou make Marriages with them: Thy Daughter &s;halt thou not give unto his Son; nor his Daughter &s;halt thou take unto thy Son.</HI> And why? Becau&s;e, &s;aid the Lord, <HI>They will turn away thy Son from following me.</HI></P>
<P>Now if this be the Con&s;equence &s;till of &s;uch <HI>Mixt-Marriage,</HI> then &s;uch Mar|riages are &s;till unlawful, and the Law &s;till in Force; that forbids them. But that the Con&s;equence of &s;uch Marriages is &s;till the &s;ame, I appeal, not only to the <HI>Witne&s;s of God in all;</HI> but al&s;o unto &s;ound <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and true <HI>Experience.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, the Prohibition afore&s;aid was not intended again&s;t the&s;e <HI>Seven</HI> Na|tions only; but had a more general Ex|tent: For the <HI>I&s;realites</HI> were not allowed to take them Wives of the Daugh|ters of <HI>A&s;hdod</HI> of <HI>Ammon,</HI> or of <HI>Moab;</HI> and for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, not of any other People that were <HI>not Circumci&s;ed,</HI> and made Partakers of the true Wor&s;hip of God.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004322_0004_1004535A47FA28F8">
This appears from the Words of <HI>Ne|hemiah,</HI> chap. 13.23. <HI>In tho&s;e Days,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;aw I</HI> Jews <HI>that had married Wives of</HI> A&s;hdod, <HI>of</HI> Ammon, <HI>and of</HI> Moab, <HI>and their Children &s;pake half in the Speech of</HI> A&s;hdod, <HI>and could not &s;peak the</HI> Jews <HI>Language,</HI> ver. 24. <HI>And I contended with them, and &s;mote certain of them;</HI> and made them renew their Covenant with the Lord, <HI>Saying, You &s;hall not take their Daughters unto your Sons; nor give your Daughters unto their Sons.</HI> Adding <HI>ver.</HI> 26. <HI>Did not</HI> Solomon, <HI>King of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>&s;in by the&s;e Things? Yet among many Nations there was no King like Him, who was be|loved of his God: Neverthele&s;s, even him did &s;trange Women cau&s;e to &s;in: Shall we then,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>hearken unto you, to do all this great Evil, to tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t our God, in marrying of &s;trange Wives.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, in &s;hort, we &s;ee how &s;uch <HI>Mar|riages</HI> are again&s;t the written Law of God, and the Practice of his faithful People.</P>
<P>But long before this Law was brought into Writing, the Holy <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> and &s;uch as feared, and wor&s;hipped the true God, even from the Beginning of the World, &s;hewed a <HI>Di&s;like</HI> of &s;uch <HI>Mixt-Marriages,</HI> from the Sen&s;e of the Law
<PB N="6" REF="004322_0005_1004536C253B5388">written in their Hearts; and &s;o long as they kept in the true Faith, and at a <HI>lawful Di&s;tance</HI> from &s;uch as were not Partakers thereof with them (which for &s;ome Time they did) the Lord was with them, and ble&s;&s;ed them, and made them In&s;trumental in his Hand, for the <HI>with|holding</HI> his <HI>Wrath</HI> from being pre&s;ently poured out upon the old <HI>World.</HI> But when they had generally departed from his <HI>Covenant,</HI> and from the <HI>Example</HI> of the Righteous, even in <HI>this particular Ca&s;e,</HI> mark what followed.</P>
<P><HI>It came to pa&s;s, when Men began to mul|tiply upon the Face of the Earth, and Daugh|ters were born unto them, the Sons of God &s;aw that the Daughters of Men were fair, and they took them Wives of all that they cho&s;e.</HI> That is, they made <HI>no Di&s;tinction</HI> upon the Account of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> But to whom&s;oever their <HI>fle&s;hly Minds</HI> inclined, them they took to <HI>Wife;</HI> like the di&s;honourable and unchri&s;tian Prac|tice of &s;ome in our Day. And that &s;ore|ly grieved the Spirit of the the Lord; &s;o that thereupon he &s;aid, <HI>I will de&s;troy Man, whom I have created;</HI> Gen. 6.5, 6, 7.</P>
<P>And when the <HI>Sons of God</HI> came in unto tho&s;e <HI>Daughters of Men,</HI> and they
<PB N="7" REF="004322_0006_1004537B17B3C790">bare Children unto them, the &s;ame (it is &s;aid) became <HI>Mighty Men:</HI> But by whom they were &s;o accounted, and for what Cau&s;e, may be gathered from the Sequel. It was not, &s;urely, from their Faith, and Holine&s;s towards God, that they were &s;o accounted: For if it had been &s;o, he would not have repented that he had made them, as in <HI>Gen.</HI> 6. it is &s;aid he did. But it &s;eems rather to have been from their Statuers and Bodily-Strength, whereby they could archive great Matters in the World, which made them be reputed Mighty, by &s;uch as did bear the &s;ame Fallen Image with them&s;elves; who were known and di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Chil|dren of God, by the name of the Children of Men, being, in the Main of their Conver&s;ation, without a God-like, or Re|ligious Mark: For, the Earth, it is &s;aid, <HI>was full of Violence, and there were Giants in tho&s;e Days,</HI> Gen. 6.4.</P>
<P>Now when Things were come to this pa&s;s the People of God having ca&s;t off his <HI>Yoke,</HI> and fallen in with the World and its Spirit (which they openly decla|red by their Entring into the neare&s;t Af|finity by Marriages with them) and had their Hearts thereby drawn away more
<PB N="8" REF="004322_0007_10045387EFBA8568">and more from following the Lord; (which always was and is the natural Con&s;equence of &s;uch <HI>Affinities</HI> by Marri|ages and is therefore the more hanious and pernicious:) Then did the Lord call upon <HI>Noah,</HI> and gave him Direction to build an <HI>Ark,</HI> for the Safety of him&s;elf and his Family. For <HI>all Fle&s;h had,</HI> by that Time, <HI>corrupted his Way upon the Earth;</HI> which &s;o provoked the Lord God that he determined to de&s;troy all Fle&s;h by a Flood, except <HI>Noah</HI> only, and his Family. For <HI>Noah</HI> being a Ju&s;t Man, and Perfect in his Generation, and one that walked with God, found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord, to be exempted from that General De&s;truction.</P>
<P>If nothing more could be alledged again&s;t the&s;e <HI>Mixt-Marriages,</HI> this Con&s;i|deration (one would think) were, of its &s;elf, enough, to manife&s;t how great a Sin it is, and to deter all con&s;iderate Men and Women from entring into it, that it appears to have been a great Step, that led to the De&s;truction of the old World, the Door that gave the inlet to tho&s;e Corruptions, and <HI>Vio|lence,</HI> which filled the Earth, and pro|voked the Lord, not only to repent
<PB N="9" REF="004322_0008_100453998012D068">that he had made Man, but to pour down his Wrath in a <HI>Flood,</HI> which de&s;troyed both Man and Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>We have &s;een the Mi&s;chief the Un|godly brought upon Mankind, by tho&s;e <HI>Mixt-Marriages</HI> before the Flood. Now let us &s;ee, and heedfully ob&s;erve the great Care the <HI>Godly</HI> took after the Flood, to prevent the like Evil and Danger.</P>
<P>After the general Overthrow of Un|godly Men by the Flood, from which only <HI>Noah,</HI> with his Family (Eight Souls in all) were pre&s;erved in the Ark (which was a Figure of Chri&s;t) was born <HI>A|braham;</HI> whom God called out of his own Country, and from his Father's Hou&s;e, with <HI>Sarah</HI> his Wife, to make of them a di&s;tinct and peculiar People to him&s;elf. And he e&s;tabli&s;hed his Co|venant with <HI>Abraham,</HI> (and his Ble&s;&s;ing upon his Seed) who &s;aw Chri&s;t's Day, and was glad; and in the Faith thereof walked before the Lord, with a Perfect Heart: In which Faith al&s;o he offered up his Son <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> unto the Lord, as the Lord had commanded him. Such was the Obedience he added unto his Faith: which was accounted unto him for <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Gen. 3.6.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004322_0009_100411D7953F4908">
Now when <HI>I&s;aac</HI> the Child of Promi&s;e was grown up to a Marriageable Age, &s;o great was the Care of his Godly <HI>Fa|ther</HI> for him, that he might not be un|equally Yoaked, or joyned in Marriage, calling his elde&s;t Servant to him (who had the Charge and Over&s;ight of all that he had) he made him Swear by the Lord, the God of Heaven; and the God of the Earth, that he &s;hould not take a Wife unto his Son of the Daughters of the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> among&s;t whom he dwelt, But <HI>thou &s;halt go,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>unto my Country and to my Kindred, and &s;halt take a Wife unto my Son from: hence,</HI> Gen. 24.</P>
<P>This &s;o &s;trict a Charge, &s;o &s;olemnly given, and &s;o firmly bound, &s;hews that this Good Man did not look upon this Matter of <HI>Mixt-Marriages,</HI> with an ea&s;ie Eye as an indifferent Thing; but was earne&s;tly and heartily concerned, that his Son might not be joined with one of a different Religion: And as his hone&s;t Care was thus exerci&s;ed in &s;ending his Servant to <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Kindred, to the Family of <HI>Bethuel;</HI> &s;o the Providential Hand of God was apparently with him, in the Choice of <HI>Rebecca,</HI> and the Con|&s;ent they gave to it, &s;aying, <HI>The Thing
<PB N="11" REF="004322_0010_100453A91880FAD0">proceedeth of the Lord: Let her be thy Ma&s;ter's Son's Wife, as the Lord hath &s;poken.</HI> And in Conclu&s;ion, they ble&s;&s;ed her and &s;ent her away. And as <HI>I&s;aac</HI> was walking, and <HI>meditating</HI> in the Fields at Evening-tide, he met <HI>Rebecca</HI> coming with his Father's Servants, and took her to be his Wife: And &s;he, after twen|ty Years Barrenne&s;s, bare him two Sons, <HI>E&s;au</HI> and <HI>Jacob;</HI> who&s;e different Prac|tice in the Ca&s;e of Marriage let us now ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>What <HI>E&s;au</HI> was; is well known, both by his &s;elling of his <HI>Birth-right,</HI> and o|ther Characters given him in the Holy Scriptures: When he was Forty Years of Age, he took him Two Wives, and both of them Unbelievers, Daughters of the <HI>Hittites,</HI> which Thing full &s;orely grieved his Godly Parents: And is left upon Record, as a Mark of his Unduti|fulne&s;s and Di&s;obedience, in not advi&s;ing with, and being ruled by them, in that &s;o weighty Affair. And may it be a Caution unto all &s;uch, as profe&s;s them|&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians, and &s;o of the Righteous Line, <HI>That they follow not the Example of Profane</HI> E&s;au!</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004322_0011_100453B735BAAB50">
But when he &s;aw, that what he had done had di&s;plea&s;ed his, Parents, he (to mend, as he thought, the Matter) took him another Wife the Daughter of his Uncle <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> the <HI>Scoffer;</HI> who, for <HI>mock|ing I&s;aac,</HI> the right Heir, had in his Child|hood, been ca&s;t out of the Family. Now if it had been external Kindred on|ly, that was aimed at by <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac</HI> in <HI>Marriage,</HI> &s;urely <HI>E&s;au</HI> had now hit it: For &s;he was his Fathers Neice; yet that brought him not, in a right Sen&s;e within the Family, nor Example of the Faithful.</P>
<P>But <HI>E&s;au</HI>'s thus <HI>running out,</HI> from the Practice of the Godly, to take him &s;uch Wives as his airy Mind led him to choo&s;e, without Regard had to true Religion, &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affected his Good Mother <HI>Rebecca,</HI> that complaining to her Hus|band thereof, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>I am weary of my Life, becau&s;e of the Daughters of</HI> Heth! <HI>If</HI> Jacob <HI>&s;hould take a Wife</HI> (as his Bro|ther hath done) of the Daughters of <HI>Heth,</HI> &s;uch as are the Daughters of the Land, what good &s;hall my Life do me? <HI>Gen</HI> 27.46.</P>
<P>Good <HI>I&s;aac</HI> thereupon, to prevent that <HI>Danger,</HI> calling his Son <HI>Jacob</HI> to him, gave him his Ble&s;&s;ing, and with it this
<PB N="13" REF="004322_0012_100411E370A308D8">&s;trict Charge, <HI>Thou &s;halt not take a Wife of the Daughters of</HI> Canaan. <HI>Ari&s;e go to</HI> Padan-Aram, <HI>to the Hou&s;e of</HI> Bethuel <HI>thy Mother's Father, and take thee a Wife from thence,</HI> Gen. 28.1, 2.</P>
<P><HI>Jacob,</HI> as became a dutiful Child, was obedient to his Parents herein: And the Lord was with him, and ble&s;&s;ed him; and ble&s;&s;ed his <HI>Family</HI> al&s;o until they gave Way to a Liberty, not plea|&s;ing to the Lord.</P>
<P>Then was <HI>Dinah, Jacob</HI>'s only Daugh|ter, made an early <HI>Example</HI> of the Lord's Di&s;plea&s;ure, by his &s;uffering her to fall into contempt, <HI>Gen.</HI> 34. Not only for her gratifying a vain Mind, in going out, thro' curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Daughters of the Land; whereby &s;he came to be en|&s;nared and defiled by Shechem, <HI>Gen.</HI> 34. but al&s;o, as it appears, the <HI>I&s;realites</HI> were at that Time &s;o far relap&s;ed, that they had &s;trange Gods among them, and, as may be gathered from the Text, &s;trange Attire al&s;o; which was to be changed, and done away, before they might go up to the Hou&s;e of God, to wor&s;hip him acceptably there, <HI>Gen.</HI> 35.2, 3.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things might be likely to rai&s;e an Expectation in the Shechemites that in
<PB N="14" REF="004322_0013_100453C69441D638">time they might draw them to become one People with them. Whereupon, ha|ving already got hold of one of <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Family, they were de&s;irous of a further Conver&s;e, in order to enter into Affinity, with them; &s;aying, <HI>make your Marriages with us: Give your Daughters unto us, and take our Daughters unto you; and you &s;hall dwell with us,</HI> Gen. 34.9, 10. And to entice them thereunto, they proffered the <HI>I&s;realites</HI> what Worldly advantages &s;oever they would ask, <HI>ver.</HI> 12. Nay they went &s;o far, as to yield to take on them the <HI>Badge</HI> (and a &s;ore one too) of <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Religion, <HI>ver.</HI> 24. but it was but for car|nal and covetous ends, <HI>ver.</HI> 23. and &s;uc|ceeded to them accordingly. But the Truth of the Matter was, and is, that <HI>Jacob,</HI> the True Seed, (the Peculiar Peo|ple of God) <HI>mu&s;t live alone,</HI> and not be <HI>mixed,</HI> or numbered among the Nations Wherefore, notwith&s;tanding all the great Proffers, and Importunity of <HI>Shechem</HI> (and the Conde&s;cention of the <HI>Shechemites</HI>) to have obtained <HI>Dinah</HI> for his Wife; <HI>Jacob</HI> would not hearken unto him. And yet it is &s;aid, <HI>The Man was more Honoura|ble, than all the Hou&s;e of his Fathers.</HI> For <HI>I&s;rael</HI> having an Eye to the Covenant of
<PB N="15" REF="004322_0014_100412146004DA88">God, wherein he and his Family were comprehended, he zealou&s;ly with&s;tood the Temptation; and thereby gave a Demon&s;tration of his <HI>Faith.</HI> And when, &s;oon after the Lord commanded him to go up to <HI>Bethel,</HI> he called fir&s;t for a Re|formation in his <HI>Family.</HI> Whereupon it is &s;aid, They gave unto him all the &s;trange Gods that were in their Hands, and all their Ear-rings that were in their Ears; which he hid under the Oak that was by <HI>Shechem.</HI> And then, having clean&s;ed his <HI>Family</HI> from tho&s;e Heatheni&s;h Like|ne&s;&s;es, both he and they were thence|forth at quiet, from &s;uch like Attempts by their Unbelieving Neighbours.</P>
<P>But to proceed. Having a little touch|ed upon Things, relating to the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of the Holy <HI>Patriarchs</HI> a|bout the&s;e unlawful <HI>Marriages;</HI> and brief|ly &s;et forth &s;ome of the pernicious Con|&s;equences that have always attended them, both before and after the Flood: I &s;hall now come nearer to the pre&s;ent State and Di&s;pen&s;ation we are under.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> came to &s;peak of this <HI>Ordinance</HI> of Marriage, they ran in the &s;ame Channel, as all the <HI>Faithful</HI> had done before; &s;aying. <HI>Be ye not unequally
<PB N="16" REF="004322_0015_100411EF4E43AC20">Yoaked with Unbelievers,</HI> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 6.14. And <HI>Peter</HI>'s Exhortation and Care for the Married was, that they might be <HI>Heirs together of the Grace of Life; that their Prayers might not be hindered,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.7. Then &s;uch mu&s;t be of the &s;ame <HI>Faith,</HI> and agree in Spirit, or el&s;e they cannot pray together acceptably, <HI>Mat</HI> 18.19. <HI>Can two walk together except they be agreed</HI> &s;aid the Prophet <HI>Amos,</HI> Chap. 3.3. Therefore &s;uch as are obliged to live and walk together for Term of Life, if they are not &s;o agreed and united in Spirit, are like to have but little Comfort, Help and Furtherance (if any) from each other in Spiritual Things; which is the Way that leads to true and la&s;ting Comfort for ever. For &s;ince without <HI>Faith,</HI> and an an&s;wera|ble Conver&s;ation it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God. Such married Folks as differ in <HI>Faith,</HI> and di&s;agree in their Religious Conver&s;ations, are not like to plea&s;e God nor one another; but may rather expect the contrary, with much Confu&s;ion, which doth naturally attend &s;uch <HI>Mi&s;-matchings</HI> in that Condition of Life.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> (1 <HI>Epi&s;t.</HI> 7.9.) faith, <HI>The Wife is bound by the Law, as long as her Husband liveth:
<PB N="17" REF="004322_0016_100453EA94899D38">But when he is dead, &s;he is at Liberty to be married to whom &s;he will, only in the Lord.</HI> That is the ancient Limit.</P>
<P>But, by the Way, this gives no Liber|ty for &s;uch to marry as are near of Kin; tho' otherwi&s;e duly qualified</P>
<P>But if any &s;hould object, that <HI>Abraham I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> married their near Kin&s;-Women? and thereupon &s;hould query, why it might not be as lawfull for &s;uch Kindred now to marry, as it was for them then.</P>
<P>I An&s;wer, fir&s;t, That what they did in that Ca&s;e then was before the Law was given, which doth expre&s;ly forbid it, <HI>Levit.</HI> 18.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is a common <HI>Maxim,</HI> and in great Mea&s;ure true, that Nece&s;&s;ity hath no Law. And every Rea&s;onable Man is capable of con&s;idering, that in tho&s;e early Ages of the World there was a Nece&s;&s;ity for it. And for <HI>Abraham,</HI> and tho&s;e before mentioned of his <HI>Po&s;terity,</HI> they lived <HI>not very long</HI> after the Flood, which gaven Kind of <HI>new Beginning to</HI> the World with Re&s;pect to its being again Re|pleni&s;hed with People.

<P>When the Apo&s;tle exhorted the <HI>Belie|vers</HI> of old <HI>not to be unequally Yoaked to|gether with unbelievers,</HI> 2 Cor. 6 14 may we &s;uppo&s;e he intended to re&s;train the Prohibition, only to tho&s;e ob&s;olete and notorious Unbelievers, who were Pagans, or Heathens? Or did it extend to all, that did not believe the Manife&s;tation of Chri&s;t Outwardly in the <HI>Fle&s;h?</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> did believe in God, and that Chri&s;t the Son of God &s;hould come: But they did not believe in him as He was then come; and manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h among them. Might the Chri&s;tian Believers, notwith&s;tanding that, have mingled in Marriages with the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> becau&s;e of their General Belief in God, and in Chri&s;t to come, though they re|jected him in his then pre&s;ent <HI>Appearance?</HI> Would that have been an Equal Yoaking? So likewi&s;e, if one that believes, not only the Outward Appearance of Chri&s;t, with re&s;pect to his having come in the Fle&s;h; but his inward Appearance al&s;o, with Re&s;pect to his being come in the Spirit, by his Divine Light and Grace, to Rule in the Hearts of his People, and
<PB N="26" REF="004322_0025_1004544650BB66C8">thereby, to both direct and enable them, as they attend thereunto, how to perform Divine Wor&s;hip and Service to God, &s;hould marry one that denies, and op|po&s;es that Inward and Spiritual Coming and Appearance of Chri&s;t in the Heart, and &s;ticks only to his Belief of His Out|ward Coming and Appearance in the <HI>H&eacute;&s;h</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem:</HI> Would &s;uch a Couple be equally Yoaked.</P>
<P>But not to pre&s;s the Compari&s;on too clo&s;e, becau&s;e I would both avoid Offence and u&s;e what Brevity I can; I &s;ay, if two Per&s;ons of different Judgments about Matters of Faith and Religious Exerci&s;es (as going to Meetings, Preaching, Pray|ing, Thanksgiving, &amp;<HI>c</HI>) &s;hould incline to marry each other, pre&s;uming in their <HI>fond Affections,</HI> that, notwith&s;tanding that Di&s;agreement, they may live com|fortably together, they will find too late that they were greatly mi&s;taken. For although, if it were only a Di&s;agreement in their Tempers or natural Di&s;po&s;itions, which concerned only their outward Conver&s;ation one towards the other, or the Management of their Temporal Af|fairs, it might be hoped they might live tolerably together: Yet where the Dif|ference
<PB N="27" REF="004322_0026_1004121B71236050">is of &s;o high a Strain and Na|ture, as concerns the Peace of Con&s;cience, and Safety of the <HI>Soul</HI> on either Side; that cannot be reconciled, without the Conver&s;ion of one of them, which is out of Man's Power, of him&s;elf to effect. Wherefore, altho' &s;uch may talk of, and promi&s;e to them&s;elves <HI>Unity</HI> in &s;uch <HI>Con|trariety:</HI> Yet by that Time <HI>their Folly &s;hall have corrected them;</HI> they will find Cau&s;e to be of another Mind. And if their Love to God and Religion, be not quite con&s;umed by tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Flames</HI> which engaged them into that unwarran|table Undertaking: they will &s;eel, after Marriage, their Spirits more plainly and warmly conflicting one with another, and &s;triving to bring each other into a Conformity unto that Way of Wor&s;hip, which he or &s;he is in. And then, which&s;oever of them prevails, the other mu&s;t lo&s;e Peace of <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> (the great|e&s;t of all Lo&s;&s;es) unle&s;s &s;uch Compliance &s;pring from a true and unfeigned Con|viction that the Wor&s;hip &s;o conformed to, is the Right: Which is more than may rea&s;onably be expected by any, who are guilty of Tempting the Lord with &s;uch Mixt-Marriages.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="004322_0027_1004544FF88AD2B0">
Be&s;ides when two of Di&s;agreeing Per|&s;wa&s;ions in Religious Exerci&s;es, do joyn in Marriage, no Man can rea&s;onably think, that their Affection to each other is grounded on, or governed by Religi|on; and if not, that it mu&s;t be by &s;ome Worldly end: And to cloke &s;uch a Marriage with a pretence of Hope, to convert each other to what each be|lieveth is right, is in plain Engli&s;h no better then <HI>a &s;inning that Grace may abound; a doing Evil, that good may come of it.</HI></P>
<P>But now the Ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e, where two, of one and the &s;ame Per&s;wation in Religion or of no Religion, are joyned together in Marriage: And afterwards one of them is converted to the True Religion: The converted may expect the Lord's Ble&s;&s;ing; and abiding toge|ther, may be a Means of Sanctification and Good to the other, according to the Apo&s;tle's Doctrine, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.14. And the Nature of True Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Now as to the latter Part of the Ob|jection, I readily grant that the Lord hath many, that in a Sen&s;e may be &s;aid to belong to him, who are not as yet profe&s;&s;ed Members of the vi&s;ible Church
<PB N="29" REF="004322_0028_1004545B8F779C28">nor known unto it. This our Saviour plainly intimated, when in his Di&s;cour&s;e to the <HI>Jews</HI> pointing at the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>Other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold: Them al&s;o I mu&s;t bring, and they &s;hall hear my Voice; and there &s;hall be one Fold, and one Shepherd,</HI> John 10.16. But until the&s;e other Sheep be gathered, and brought, by the Great Shepherd into the Fold; although they are known to the Lord, yet are they not &s;o well known to his People, as to be capable of being admit|ted into Church-Communion, or Fel|low&s;hip with them; much le&s;s into that Marriage Union with them, of which we have been treating.</P>
<P>But to have done, at length, with this Objection, I &s;hall now remind the Rea|der, That when the Sons of God, in the Old World, had degenerated, and were Apo&s;tatized, as hath been before ob&s;er|ved, their Motive to the&s;e Mixt-Marri|ages was, <HI>They &s;aw the Daughters of Men were fair and they took them Wives of all that they cho&s;e,</HI> Gen. 6.2. So that to gratifie the Lu&s;t of the Eye, was the In|ducement of their <HI>Marriages.</HI> And to &s;uch an Eye now (as al&s;o to tho&s;e as have
<PB N="30" REF="004322_0029_1004546030F13C60">a covetous Mind, reaching unduly after the Things of this World) this may &s;eem an unnece&s;&s;ary Scruple; e&s;pecially when it &s;tands in their Way, to hinder them from the obtaining of their de&s;ired End, But the truly Con&s;cientious will always find them&s;elves obliged, for the Sake of Religion and Duty to God, to do no|thing that may hinder their Per&s;everance and Progre&s;&s;ion therein: Which Di&s;a|greement about Religion will naturally do, more or le&s;s, according to the Pro|portion of the Di&s;agreement.</P>
<P>Wherefore, though our Ca&s;e be not the &s;ame as old <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s was in every De|gree: Yet if it be &s;o in any Degree, and have the &s;ame Tendency in any Mea|&s;ure (which that it has, is undeniable;) then it brings our Times under the Force of the &s;ame Prohibition and Law, and that for the &s;ame Rea&s;on (namely) Becau&s;e they will turn away, or hinder thy Sons from following me, &s;aith the Lord.</P>
<P>And now my Dear Friends (for unto you who bear the Name of <HI>Quakers,</HI> whether ye be &s;uch, as the Lord hath been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to call and ga|ther out of any other Religious Profe&s;|&s;ions,

Shun, as much as may be, the too frequent and familiar Conver&s;e with tho&s;e of other Profe&s;&s;ions; &s;uch, e&s;pecially, as may be mo&s;t likely to allure and draw your Minds out. Be not cold and in|different about Religion. Halt not be|tween Two. If God be God (which, I hope, you are fully per&s;waded of) fol|low him, and keep clo&s;e with him, that you may know your Minds &s;taid, and e&s;tabli&s;hed upon him: And then will ye &s;ee, for your Encouragement, the <HI>Advan|tages</HI> and Comfort that &s;uch have and enjoy, who make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to plea&s;e him. And whatever your Condi|tion and Circum&s;tances in this World be, let your chiefe&s;t Trea&s;ure and Plea|&s;ure, be in Heaven and heavenly Things; and then your Hearts will be there al&s;o, as our Saviour taught, <HI>Mat,</HI> 6.21.

<P>And now, my Friends, I would come near unto you, by Way of Enquiry: Have you indeed been convinced of the Truth, and been made &s;en&s;ible of the Cro&s;s, that attends the Profe&s;&s;ion of it? And have you been faithful to tho&s;e Convictions, and followed the Lord in the Way of Regeneration? Or have ye not? This is an important Point, the Con&s;equence of which may turn the Scale to either Hand: Therefore, I pray, let it be duly con&s;idered. For to be found <HI>per&s;evering in the Way of Truth,</HI> which we make Profe&s;&s;ion of, and in all the Parts and Branches of it, will be of a double Advantage to us. It will not only pre&s;erve from adding Sin to Sin, (which, if not timely prevented, will lead &s;uch into &s;piritual Adultery, a de|parting from God and withdrawing from him both their Love and Subjection; which, more or le&s;s, precedes &s;uch <HI>mixt Un&s;criptural Marriages:</HI>) But it will al&s;o bring us to under&s;tand the Difference which hath always been between the <HI>Two Seeds;</HI> and that will tend greatly

<P>What did it avail <HI>Dives,</HI> or the Rich Man in the Parable, that he could call <HI>Abraham</HI> Father, and that <HI>Ab aham</HI> vouch&s;afed to call him <HI>Son,</HI> while he mean while was in Hell! Read the <HI>Parable</HI> throughout (<HI>Luke</HI> 16.20. to the End) and con&s;ider it well. The Rich Man there, after he had mi&s;-&s;pent his precious Time in <HI>voluptuous Living</HI> (wearing Rich <HI>Apparel</HI> and <HI>faring &s;umptuou&s;ly</HI> every Day) at length died, and was buried too, and that probably, as he had lived, in Pomp and State, as &s;uch commonly now a-days are. The Poor Man <HI>Lazarus,</HI> died al&s;o, but it is likely his Funeral was too mean and private, to be taken Notice of: For we read nothing of it. But that which is better, we read, namely, That he was carried by Angels into A|braham's Bo&s;om. But the next Account we have of <HI>Dives,</HI> is, That he was in
<PB N="36" REF="004322_0035_10045484F2B621C8"><HI>Hell, Begging;</HI> and that for a &s;mall Alms too, but a Drop or two of cold Water: And yet (<HI>O mi&s;erable Man!</HI>) even that was denied him. He being in <HI>Hell,</HI> lift|ed up his Eyes, and &s;aw <HI>Abraham</HI> afar off, and <HI>Lazarus</HI> (poor de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Laza|rus</HI>) in his Bo&s;om. Whereupon he cri|ed, and &s;aid, <HI>Father</HI> Abraham, <HI>have Mer|cy on me; and &s;end</HI> Lazarus <HI>that he may dip the Tip of his Finger in Water, and cool my Tongue: For I am tormented in this Flame:</HI> A Thing he might well have fore&s;een, had he but lifted up his Eyes in Time. <HI>Abraham</HI> not di&s;allowing his Claim of Kindred according to the Fle&s;h, yet vindicating the Ju&s;tice of God upon him, an&s;wered, <HI>Son remember that thou in thy Life-time, received'&s;t thy good Things,</HI> [Riches, Honours, Plea&s;ures and Worldly Delicacies, which thou did&s;t account thy <HI>Good-things</HI>] <HI>and like|wi&s;e</HI> Lazarus Evil, [Poverty, Pain, Con|tempt and Mi&s;ery:] <HI>But now is he com|forted, and thou art tormented:</HI> Nor was that all: But, as an <HI>Agravation</HI> of his great <HI>Unhappine&s;s,</HI> from a Sen&s;e that his Torment are remedile&s;s, and that there would be no End of his Mi&s;ery, he tells him further; <HI>And be&s;ides all this, between
<PB N="37" REF="004322_0036_100454897988AEF8">us and you there is a great Gulf fixed: So that they that would pa&s;s from hence to you, cannot; neither can they pa&s;s to us that would come from thence.</HI> This put <HI>Dives</HI> out of all Hopes of Relief for him&s;elf. Wherefore having now at length &s;ome <HI>Pity</HI> for his own Family, tho' he had none for <HI>Lazarus;</HI> when he needed it, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf again to <HI>Ain aham,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>I pray thee therefore, Father, that thou would&s;t &s;end him to my Father's Hou&s;e; for I have five Brethren that he may te&s;tifie unto them, le&s;t they al&s;o come into this Place of Torment.</HI> What need of That, &s;aid <HI>Abraham, They have</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>and the</HI> Prophets; <HI>let them hear them. Nay Father</HI> Abraham, <HI>repli|ed</HI> Dives, <HI>but if One went to them from the Dead they will repent.</HI> No, no, &s;aid Abraham, <HI>If they hear not</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>and the</HI> Prophets [which was the means they profe&s;&s;ed, as appointed by God, for the In&s;truction of his People, under that Di&s;pen&s;ation] <HI>neither will they be per&s;wa|ded though one ro&s;e from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>From this <HI>Parable,</HI> Two Things, mo&s;t pertinent to my pre&s;ent Subject, are to be ob&s;erved. One, That the Highe&s;t Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, the neare&s;t Re|lation
<PB N="38" REF="004322_0037_10045494225CF770">outwardly to the Godly, though it were that of a Child to the mo&s;t God|ly Parents, is not &s;ufficient, without the Living Faith, and the Living Fruits thereof, <HI>a Godly life and Conver&s;ation,</HI> to keep from coming into the Place of Torment. The other is, That &s;uch as neglect to wait upon, and &s;erve God in his own way and Time, to be made by him <HI>Wi&s;e unto Salvation,</HI> through the Grace and Under&s;tanding given them for that End in the Pre&s;ent Di&s;pen&s;ation they are under; will Naturally grow Blind and Hard: So that they cannot be wrought upon, to be made &s;en&s;ible of the Danger they are in, by the mo&s;t extraordinary Means; No, not <HI>if one were &s;ent to them from the Dead.</HI> And &s;ince <HI>there is no other Name under Heaven given, whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved,</HI> but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t (<HI>Acts.</HI> 4.12.) And the Grace coming by Him, brings the Salva|tion that Chri&s;t, is the Author of; how greatly doth it concern every One, to attend Daily and Diligently on Him, in the Gift of his Grace; and to hearken to and obey his Teachings thereby! For <HI>God who at Sundry Times and in divers Manners, &s;pake unto the Fathers by the
<PB N="39" REF="004322_0038_10045498AE63DEA8">Prophets,</HI> (Heb. 1.1.) <HI>hath in the&s;e la&s;t Days &s;poken unto us by his Son:</HI> And that in Divers Manners al&s;o; as imme|diately by his Spirit, in&s;trumentally by his Mini&s;ters, as al&s;o in the Holy Scrip|tures, and by his many Providences. And if, (as the Apo&s;tle argueth, <HI>Hebrews</HI> 12.25.) <HI>they e&s;caped not, who refu&s;ed him that &s;pake on Earth: Much more &s;hall not we e&s;cape, if we turn away from him that &s;peaketh from Heaven.</HI></P>
