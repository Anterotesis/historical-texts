There was not any one a|mong them that pretended to be an Officer more than the re&s;t, and &s;urely their general de&s;ign to officiate without knowing that it be|long'd to any of them, argues them very Ignorant or unbelieving of that text, Heb. 5.4. <HI>And no man taketh this Honour unto him&s;elf, but he that is called of God as was Aaron.</HI> Any Body may gue&s;s what a religious Meeting they were like to have, who thus Pre&s;umptuou&s;ly de&s;igned a So|lemn Thing, without any Real and Manife&s;t call from God.</P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P><HI>In the next Place,</HI> He don't &s;ay Ju&s;tly, that this Brother, (viz) <HI>Andrew Davis,</HI> was Travelling <HI>together</HI> with John Rogers; for they came in di&s;tinct Companies from their re&s;pective Places, and came into Town at a different Time, and this &s;o exactly according to the Vi&s;ible a&s;pect of their common De&s;ign, in the whole; as if it were ordered on purpo&s;e, that one company might Di&s;turb the People as they were returning at Noon from the more publick Exerci&s;e; and the other, the Re&s;idue that were about an Hour after returning from the Sacramental Solemnity (it being the Day for that &s;pecial Attendance) But whatever they de&s;ign'd by &s;uch a critical
<PB N="5" REF="002726_0007_0FE61489DBF8B4A0">timing of their Travel thro' the Streets; or whither it was purely Accidental: It &s;eem'd to be the more In&s;olent in them (when they might have gone another way) and was the more Di&s;turbing and Offen&s;ive to us The fir&s;t Com|pany bringing a Chair with them to aggravate the offence, and &s;ome of the other Company calling out to the People, <HI>Did ye not hear, There is a &s;olemn Ordinance to be Admini&s;tred to morrow upon a Per&s;on at Lebanon, According to Chri&s;ts In&s;titution?</HI> Neither of which could be nece&s;&s;ary to the peaceable Enjoyment of their own per&s;wa&s;ion, but de&s;igned as I ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e to give the great|er Di&s;turbance to our u&s;ual quietne&s;s on the Sabbath. And tho' it cannot be ju&s;tly tho't a matter of Con&s;cience in them to come to us, in &s;uch Time and Manner, when they knew it was contrary to the Law of the Government, and would be offen&s;ive to us, the trouble&s;ome con|&s;equents of which they might have &s;pared them|&s;elves, and us from, without any Injury to their Religion (if it may be &s;o called.) Yet I think we are obliged to take due notice of them, when they did &s;o come, except we might tame|ly re&s;ign up the &s;acredne&s;s of the Sabbath, and our peaceable Enjoyment of it, and forbid our Con&s;ciences and the Laws of God and Man to Expre&s;s their ju&s;t re&s;entments of &s;uch daring Iniquity committed again&s;t all Order &amp; Reli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion; The neglect of which re&s;entments, would but &s;trengthen the&s;e people in their In&s;olence, and Expo&s;e both our Religion and Laws to all Con|tempt, <PB N="6" REF="002726_0008_0FE6149436E29D08">And if this in&s;tance of their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion had pa&s;&s;ed unob&s;erved and unpuni&s;hed, we have ju&s;t rea&s;on to Conclude, that they would have &s;oon proceeded to give us di&s;turbance in the Publick Wor&s;hip of the Sabbath, as they have others in the Neighbourhood, by Ru&s;hing into their A&s;&s;emblies with all Clamour and Contra|diction, and Superfluity of Naughtine&s;s.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> Their Honourable Advocate don't do fairly to in&s;inuate, as tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they were de&s;igned for Lebanon to attend a religious Meeting there on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Day, as that it hath been received by the People in &amp; about Providence: For by their own Confe&s;&s;ion they de&s;ign'd to attend that the <HI>Second</HI> or <HI>Third</HI> Day of the Week; And therefore &s;ince they did not intend to have their religious Meet|ing on the Sabbath, &amp; any other Day would have Accomodated their de&s;ign (who own no Sab|bath) as well as that Day: It mu&s;t be Suppo&s;ed that they cho&s;e this Day to Travel near <HI>Thirty</HI> Miles, for nothing in the World but to Expre&s;s their Malicious Abhorrence of the Sabbath and to di&s;turb ho&s;e who Religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve it, as al&s;o to bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> defiance to the Law injoyning the ob&s;ervation of it, as by their own Confe&s;&s;ion will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ently appear, And what Mortal can &s;olve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch an un&s;criptural and no le&s;s irrational Contradiction?

Let all (&s;ave the blackned World,) Judge.</P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> He ingeniou&s;ly owns, a cording to his Information, that they &s;carcely knew their bu&s;i|ne&s;s when they &s;hou'd come <HI>there.</HI> It was (&s;ays he) <HI>In order to baptize or to &s;ee a per&s;on baptiz'd,</HI> &amp; I may add, &amp; they knew not what: They knew not it &s;eems who, or whether any of them, was to baptize or whether any per&s;on wou'd be bap|tized; and &s;o it proved the next time, when they actually went to Lebanon under the &s;ame pre|tence: Bapti&s;m was not admini&s;tred, there was no Subject, or no Officer, or they were Indifferent about it, however zealous in pretence before. Wherefore, it appears that their Infallible Spirit doth &s;ometimes deceive them, as it did their Great <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> the late <HI>John Rogers;</HI> who pretended from the In&s;pirations of it, that he was proof again&s;t all Infection of Body (as well as mind,) which the Wicked only (he &s;aid) were &s;u&s;ceptible of, and to put the matter upon trial, daringly ventured into Bo&s;ton in the time of the Small Pox. But re|ceived the Infection and Dyed of it, with &s;eve|ral of his Family, taking it from him; &s;o the Trial of his Impa&s;&s;ibility i&s;&s;ued. More In&s;tances of their Deception might be mentioned, But 'tis Enough here to In&s;tance in this relating to the pre&s;ent
<PB N="8" REF="002726_0010_0FE614954F3FBF60">Ca&s;e, for it &s;eems their Spirit (notwith&s;tanding all their pretences to Certain Immediate Directi|on by it (did not tell them what was their Bu&s;ine&s;s at Lebanon, any more than it did what &s;hould be their Sufferings at Norwich, which it did not, in|as much as they Expected according to their In|&s;olent Boa&s;t to buy our Sabbaths for five &s;hillings a piece, but finding them ri&s;en in the Price, yet with a greater Liberty granted to offenders than they u&s;ed to have, They (without any previous advices from their Spirit) did wilfully chu&s;e the Corporal Puni&s;hment, rather than the Expence of Money, and to the wonder of all &s;ober Men were more &s;paring of their Pur&s;es than of their Backs. But there might be this in it, to determine their Choice, according to their Boa&s;t of Extraordinary defence, they Expected to feel no pain, and &s;o they would have &s;aved their Backs and Money too, but they were evidently Di&s;appointed and fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nothing the le&s;s for the cau&s;e. And then they hoped to acquire to the&s;elves the Honour of Martyrs, &amp; gain &s;ome Pro&s;elytes by their Coura|gious Suffering as they pretended for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, but were al&s;o di&s;appointed in this, and I believe got no more Honour than ea&s;e by their fooli&s;h choice. Which makes me think how wittily a Lawyer ridicul'd the folly of one of the&s;e Suffer|ers, who declared that he wou'd not for the &s;ake of <HI>Fifty Pound,</HI> (or a greater Sum) Endure the &s;ame again, &amp; yet chearfully endured this in hope of a reward in the other World, who was told of his &s;ad <HI>mi&s;take</HI> &amp; <HI>poor bargain;</HI> In &s;hort, at mo&s;t he coudn't
<PB N="9" REF="002726_0011_0FE614955893D308">expect more than the value of <HI>Twenty Shillings,</HI> &s;ince that was the full Price of his Scourge; and with that he might have e&s;caped it, without any damage to his Religion. And it appeared by their whole Management that their hearts were more upon their Travel, &amp; <HI>Contempt of the Sabbath,</HI> than upon their <HI>Religious Meeting,</HI> which &s;hews that the very end and de&s;ign of their fir&s;t motion was to Offend &amp; Di&s;turb us; For when they had done this, and got their Backs whip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for it, they were content to return back again yea to Pri&s;on, rather than pay the ju&s;t Charges of their Pro&s;ecu|tion, and proceed to their Religious Meeting at Lebanon, which they might have done, if they would. Hence,</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> I may boldly confe&s;s, that they were apprehended as <HI>Malefactors</HI> and puni&s;hed as &s;uch, and &s;peak of it with a humble A&s;&s;urance that all Sober Unprejudiced Men will Ju&s;tify what was done, as they receive the full Hi&s;tory of the mat|ter.

<P>I am humbly of Opinion, that this Copy of Record which his Honour grounds his Proclama|tion upon, is not a ju&s;t occa&s;ion of it, nor a proper and &s;ufficient &s;upport to it; and the Information received by the offender, I think adds nothing to it, But rather if regarded, betrays the weakne&s;s &amp; precipitancy of the Proclamation, for who knows not, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cens'd offender in his own Ca&s;e ought not to be heard as an Evidence, and who can Think him unprejudiced and Impartial in his Declaration!
