<HEAD>Admiral BUCKNER, <HI>&s;worn.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you know Richard Parker, the Pri&s;oner?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> I do.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did the pri&s;oner belong to the Sandwich?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> He did.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What &s;tation was he in?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> I do not know what capacity he was in.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Repeat what you know of the pri&s;oner's being con|cerned in a mutiny on board the Sandwich, and of any &s;u&s;pected conduct either on board or on &s;hore, on or a|bout the 12th of May, or of any in&s;tances of di&s;re&s;pectful language or conduct to his officers during the time this mutiny exi&s;ted? <HI>A.</HI> The fir&s;t time I ob&s;erved any thing particular in the Pri&s;oner's conduct, (further than pa|rading about with a va&s;t number of people on &s;hore, with a red flag) was, on or about the 20th of May, when I went on board the Sandwich, for the purpo&s;e of making known to that &s;hip and other's his Maje&s;|ty's proclamation of pardon, on their returning to their duty, on the terms granted to their brethren at Spit-head, which the Delegates, (among whom was Parker) had previou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured me they would be &s;atisfied with. On my going on board with my flag in a boat, there was no re&s;pect &s;hewn me whatever. The officers were then without their &s;ide arms, and had no com|mand in the &s;hip. Unwilling to return on &s;hore till an opportunity offered for my &s;peaking to the people, I waited for a con&s;iderable time, when Parker, with others, came on the quarter-deck and &s;aid, that none
<PB N="5" REF="032837_0004_0FF554D2E7117318">
others but them&s;elves, (meaning, I pre&s;ume, the &s;hip's company) &s;hould be pre&s;ent. The pri&s;oner then ten|dered me a paper, containing what he and others called a li&s;t of grievances, &s;aying, at the &s;ame time, until tho&s;e were redre&s;&s;ed, they would not give up the pow|er that was then in their hands. They in&s;i&s;ted al&s;o on having it ratified by the Admiralty. Finding my ef|forts to re&s;tore order were of no avail, I went on &s;hore. On the 22d, certain troops arrived at Sheerne&s;s. On the 23d, my flag was &s;truck on board the Sandwich. On the evening of that day, I was at the Commi&s;&s;ion|er's hou&s;e, and while I was
inquiring into complaints alledged again&s;t two marines, that were brought in by a party of the Military, the Pri&s;oner, and a man whom they called Davis, with three or four others, I believe, came abruptly into the hou&s;e, and demanded why tho&s;e men were in cu&s;tody, telling me at the &s;ame time, that my flag was &s;truck&mdash;that I had no authority, and that the power was in their hands. They then took the men away, as they &s;aid, to trial. An expre&s;&s;ion made u&s;e of by Parker was, that he was not to be intimi|dated. About the 4th of June, I received a letter from Parker, &s;tating him as Pre&s;ident of the Commit|tee of Delegates.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did you receive it from Parker?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> It was &s;igned with his name: that letter &s;tated, that Admin|i&s;tration had acted improperly in &s;topping the provi&s;ions allowed the men, and that the fooli&s;h Proclamation was calculated to enflame the minds of hone&s;t men.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What Proclamation?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> The King's Procla|mation, it could be no other, he did not &s;ay that; but he meant it. I have given you the detail, and have nothing more particular to relate&mdash;I have had frequent conferences with the Pri&s;oner, and many others of them, and talked to them, in order to bring them to a &s;en&s;e of their mi&s;conduct, without any good effect; he in general took the lead as the &s;poke&s;man, with a degree of in&s;olence.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was there always a degree of in&s;olence?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> Not always, &s;ometimes there was. He appealed to the re&s;t, whether he was not authori&s;ed to &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of the whole, and if it was their wi&s;h it &s;hould be &s;o;
<PB N="6" REF="032837_0005_0FF554D472F9F510">
And even prevented one man in particular, who&s;e name I do not know, from an&s;wering a que&s;tion I had put to him, he prevented him with threats: he turned round and &s;aid to him, at the &s;ame time. "Hold your tongue; if you do not, I'll take care of you," or words to that effect. While I was on board the Sandwich, I forgot to mention, that I remon&s;trated with the Pri&s;oner, a|bout keeping tho&s;e di&s;graceful ropes called yard-ropes, hanging; but the Delegates, among whom was the Prisoner, refu&s;ed to remove them. I tried to prevail on them to return to their duty, their an&s;wer was, that the &s;hip's company would not &s;uffer them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was it with Parker?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> It was him as well the re&s;t, they were all &s;tanding together, the men who &s;tyled them&s;elves Delegates.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> In your conver&s;ations with him, did he ever ap|pear with a degree of in&s;olence?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> He frequently did, but not uniformly; &s;ometimes with a great deal of mode&s;ty, and of apparent re&s;pect, but very often otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was Lieutenant Ju&s;tice the officer who brought the report of the mutiny breaking out on the 12th of May?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> He was the officer who brought the ac|count of the breaking out of the mutiny in the Sand|wich.</P>

<P>"Vice Admiral BUCKNER. Sir, I am command|ed to inform you, that we have this day taken the opinion of the Delegates of the Fleet, they univer&s;ally agree, that the conduct of Admini&s;tration has been highly improper in &s;lopping the provi&s;ions allowed the &s;eamen, and that the fooli&s;h Proclamation which we have received, tends only to exa&s;perate the minds of hone&s;t men who are &s;erving their country. I am, Sir, Your humble &s;ervant, RICHARD PARKER." Sheerne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you believe the letters now read to be origi|nal?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> I do, I have no rea&s;on to doubt it.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="questions">
<HEAD><HI>Pri&s;oner</HI> PARKER'S <HI>Que&s;tions.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> The Admiral mentions being on board the Sandwich, on the 20th of May, and having been re|ceived with no re&s;pect on coming on board; I wi&s;h to a&s;k, who was on board fir&s;t on that day, you or I?<HI>A.</HI> I believe I was on board fir&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> I would beg leave to a&s;k, do you think I was the per&s;on who cau&s;ed you to be received with no re&s;pect?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> I meant to &s;ay, that I was not received as I ought to be, I was received without a guard; as to the Pri&s;oner, I was on board before him, and they attended me with a number of flags, not red flags, but union. I cannot an&s;wer the que&s;tion the Pri&s;oner puts, becau&s;e I was on board before him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you deem me to be the per&s;on who cau&s;ed you to be received with no re&s;pect?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> I cannot &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Admiral Buckner, plea&s;e to recollect, whether I did not come on the quarter-deck, &s;eeing you was re|ceived without re&s;pect, and informed you, (after a&s;k|ing the &s;hip's company why they could be &s;o di&s;grace|ful as not to cheer their Admiral on coming on board) that it originated entirely in a mi&s;take, but if you would excu&s;e it, and receive it now, the crew would give you three cheers?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> You did come to me and &s;ay, that no di&s;re&s;pect was intended me; &s;ome at|tempts, I believe, were made to man the &s;hip, and you did &s;ay, that if I would receive it then, the people would man the yards; &s;ome attempts were made for that purpo&s;e, but by very few, the yard-ropes were hanging then.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Does Admiral Buckner recollect that on going on &s;hore he was attended by the boats of the Sandwich, and &s;ome other boats of the fleet, &s;eeing no flag flying?<HI>A.</HI> When I was going on &s;hore I did not know that my flag was &s;truck: &s;everal boats attended me.</P>
<P>The Court advi&s;ed the Pri&s;oner to invalidate, if he could, by any que&s;tion, that part of the narrative of Admiral Buckner which &s;tated, that he had relea&s;ed two marines, and told the Admiral that all his authority on board was at an end, that he had no authority, and that the power was in their hands.</P>

<HEAD>The Admiral re-examined by the Court.</HEAD>
<P>Q. When the Pri&s;oner treated you with apparent re&s;pect and mode&s;ty, was it privately, or publicly be|fore the &s;hip's company?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> I never had any private conver&s;ation with him, and never &s;aw him excepting once before the &s;hip's company. When I &s;aw him it was generally in a parade with a number of men from different &s;hips, calling them&s;elves Delegates.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> When the Pri&s;oner came to you to apologize for the want of re&s;pect on the part of the people on board, did he appear to influence or command the people?&mdash;<HI>A.</HI> I conceive by his coming to me to make the apology, he mu&s;t have had &s;ome command in the &s;hip. I had no opportunity of making that ob&s;ervation, as immediately after, he left the quarter-deck, and I did not &s;ee him again till he came with the paper be|fore mentioned.</P>

to attend the puni&s;hment of one of the &s;eamen on board the Sandwich, who&s;e name was Cammell.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was the Pri&s;oner one of them? <HI>A.</HI> Yes, Two or three days after the above circum&s;tance, one of the &s;hip's corporals of the Sandwich, who&s;e name I believe is Wil&s;on, came to me with orders from the Committee, that I &s;hould go between decks, as there was a man in irons who was very ill with a fever. I went, and &s;aw the per&s;on that was then in irons, and I immediately de&s;ired the &s;aid &s;hip's corporal to go to the Committee, and &s;ay that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry for the pri&s;oner to be taken out of irons, and re|moved into the &s;ick birth. He returned with an an|&s;wer, that it was the Committee's order that I &s;hould make the report in per&s;on. I accordingly went to the &s;tarboard bay, on the lower deck, and there found a va&s;t crowd of people a&s;&s;embled. I a&s;ked whom I was to addre&s;s?

The Admiral returned on &s;hore, and was &s;uffered to de|part without the re&s;pect due to his rank, the man-ropes were on the yards, and the yard-ropes reeved, and the Admiral treated with much di&s;re&s;pect, for which the Officers appeared extremely concerned, not having it in their power to treat their Admiral with the proper and u&s;ual re&s;pect. I con&s;idered, therefore, the crew to be in a high &s;tate of mutiny; &s;everal days after, I was at Commi&s;&s;ioner Hartwell's hou&s;e, the Admiral was there, it was reported to him, that two marines had been brought to the guard-hou&s;e for examination, by the military.

<P>As I have been at &s;ea from my youth, I therefore hope nothing will be expected from me but a narrative of plain facts. I cannot dre&s;s up my defence in the pompous language of a lawyer; could I have procured a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I might have been enabled to have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with more propriety.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I have to return thanks to this Court for giving me the time they have, to defend my|&s;elf again&s;t the very heavy charges brought again&s;t me. Nothing but the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the integrity of my in|tentions with re&s;pect to the mutiny, and the reflection that I did not enter into it until two days after it com|menced, could have &s;upported me again&s;t &s;uch heavy charges, &s;worn to by &s;o many witne&s;&s;es, and a firm con|viction that I entered into it &s;olely with the view of repre&s;&s;ing the dangerous &s;pirit I &s;aw predominant in the fleet. The fir&s;t witne&s;s called again&s;t me was Vice-Admiral Buckner, who &s;ays he often &s;aw me, and he acknowledges my behavior to him was always re&s;pectful. I never waited on Admiral Buckner with|out the expre&s;s orders of the Delegates; and when I did, &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided &s;porting with his feelings, by improper behavior; on the contrary, I couched eve|ry me&s;&s;age I had to deliver in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms I was able. It may be a&s;ked how I came to be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> per&s;on pitched upon to deliver &s;uch me&s;&s;ages, and act as the principal in the bu&s;ine&s;s. To this I can only an&s;wer, that &s;uch was the ca&s;e. The Delegates in&s;i&s;t|ed on my a&s;&s;uming the &s;ituation I appeared in, and it
<PB N="40" REF="032837_0039_0FF51ACE1FA96090">
was impo&s;&s;ible for me, or any individual under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, to have re&s;i&s;ted &s;uch an appointment. I know nothing of the mutiny till it had broke out. As &s;oon as I &s;aw that fatal &s;pirit of the mutiny which prevailed, I immediately thought it my duty, and I en|deavored, as far as in me lay, to &s;top the further progre&s;s of it. However melancholy have been the events which have taken place, I am convinced more dreadful con&s;equences would have en&s;ued, had I not acted the part I have done&mdash;con&s;equences, which I he&s;itate not in &s;aying, I have prevented, at the hazard of my life; and feeling that I have done whatever was in my power to le&s;&s;en the evil, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> could not wholly prevent, I can wait the deci&s;ion of the Court with calmne&s;s and re&s;ignation. Admiral Buckner repre&s;ents, that on or about the 20th of May, he was not received with that re&s;pect which was due to his rank. I was &s;orry that it &s;hould have been &s;o, but that he cannot bring home to me, as he was on board before me, and I was at the time on &s;hore, attending a proce&s;&s;ion; and the Admiral him&s;elf acknowledges, that when I did go on board I went on the quarter-deck and &s;aid, it mu&s;t have been owing to &s;ome mi&s;take, he was not received with the honors due to him; and I offered that the men &s;hould man the yards, if he would receive the cheers He acknowledges an attempt was made to man the yards, which afterwards &s;ub&s;ided. It was &s;o, an attempt was made <HI>by me</HI> to that effect, though at that time it was a thing dangerous to pro|po&s;e, and done at the ri&s;k of my life, for it was &s;igni|fied, if it was complied with, that the Inflexible and the other &s;hips, would fire upon and &s;ink the Sandwich; a report having been propagated that Admiral Buckner was not a fit per&s;on to reconcile the fleet with the Ad|miralty, which &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed our people, that the re|&s;pect intended to be &s;hewn was defeated. Capt. Mo&s;s &s;ent Mr. Bray on board the Inflexible, where he &s;aid he found the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ompions out of the guns, the matches ready, and every appearance of ho&s;tility. During the whole continuance of the mutiny, there were daily meetings of the Committee of the Delegates of the
<PB N="41" REF="032837_0040_0FF5554071DE1530">
&s;hips. The Delegates received propo&s;itions, for all mea&s;ures originated on board the Inflexible; and there is not a man of the whole fleet, who does not attribute the melancholy con&s;equences that took place, to the violence of the people of the Inflexible. It was to pre|vent tho&s;e con&s;equences, I went on &s;hore to Admiral Buckner, and when I was half pa&s;&s;age to &s;hore, I fir&s;t ob&s;erved the Admiral's flag down, and the red one in its &s;tead. In an&s;wer to what Admiral Buckner has &s;aid re&s;pecting the two marines, I do not deny being commanded by the Delegates of the fleet to act as I did. The circum&s;tances were the&s;e: The people call|ed Delegates, repre&s;enting the &s;hip's company were re|fre&s;hing them&s;elves with their u&s;ual allowance, which was a pint of beer to each man. In the mean time they were informed, that two marines were in cu&s;tody, of the main-guard, for approving of the conduct of the &s;eamen. The Delegates de&s;ired me to inquire if it was &s;o. I did. The Officer &s;aid he had no &s;uch per|&s;ons in cu&s;tody. We were informed, that the two marines were at Commi&s;&s;ioner Hartwell's hou&s;e. We accordingly went and told him to relea&s;e the men, and &s;end them on board, where their conduct &s;hould be in|quired into, and the men puni&s;hed if they de&s;erved it. We &s;aw Admiral Buckner, who &s;aid the marines had u&s;ed very improper language at a hou&s;e at Queen|borough, but as we were &s;ent by the Delegates, he had no objection to our examining them. One of them appeared in a &s;tate of intoxication. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them, and Admiral Buckner &s;aid, Parker, you are a&s;k|ing very proper que&s;tions.

towards Admiral Buckner: I remember a con|ver&s;ation, wherein Admiral Buckner &s;aid, con&s;uler what mu&s;t have been my feelings at &s;eeing my flag &s;truck. I replied, I had nothing to do with &s;triking your flag. I told him I could judge what his feelings mu&s;t have been on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; that I had feel|ings of my own, and could ea&s;ily participate in his, but that I could not prevent them, as I was but a &s;in|gle individual among many. Having done with Admi|ral Buckner's evidence, I think it but ju&s;tice to ac|knowledge, that both Admiral Buckner, and Commi&s;|&s;ioner Hartwell, did every thing that lay in their power to &s;atisfy the minds of the fleet. The next evidence was Lieutenant Ju&s;tice, he &s;ays, he knows nothing of me. The third was Captain O'Bryen, who &s;ays, he knows nothing to the di&s;advantage of me. Captain Fancourt &s;aid, he never &s;aw me before. Captain Cobb, depo&s;ed to the &s;ame effect; as did Captain Parr, and Captain Hargood likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. John Snipe depo&s;es, that on the afternoon of the 14th of May, he was called on to attend the puni&s;hment of a man of the name of Cammell, and that I ordered him a dozen la&s;hes. I do not attempt to deny that I did act as he has &s;worn. I was commanded to &s;ee the puni&s;hment inflicted, but Mr. Bray was con&s;ulted as to the propriety of inflicting &s;uch a puni&s;hment for the offence he had commited, which was for getting bea&s;t|ly drunk, at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;erting he had drank noth|ing but &s;mall beer. I recommended to the whole &s;hip's crew to ab&s;tain from liquor until the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;ettled, telling them, if they did not, that the puni&s;hment which their ju&s;tice had inflicted on that man, &s;hould be inflicted on any one offending. As to the &s;ick man in irons, it was a man confined for di&s;re&s;pect to Captain Mo&s;s; the an&s;wer given by me, on that occa&s;ion, to Mr. Snipe, &s;ufficiently &s;hews, that I did not mean to interfere with his profe&s;&s;ional con|cerns; and I hope it will have the effect of &s;hewing to the Court, that I was alive to the &s;ufferings of my fellow-creatures. Mr. Snipe has &s;aid, that he had leave to go on &s;hore, on his promi&s;ing to return again
<PB N="43" REF="032837_0042_0FF555438CBAAAC0">
the next morning, but that he took care not to re|turn, till the &s;hip was under the command of its offi|cers. I &s;hall make no comment on this part of his evidence, but I &s;hall only a&s;k, whether it was prai&s;e worthy on his part, at a time when the &s;eamen were laboring under incurable di&s;orders, for a &s;urgeon to leave the &s;hip, merely becau&s;e his &s;ituation was not &s;o comfortable as he could have wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>I next come to the evidence of Capt. Surridge, of the Iris; he &s;ays, that he has &s;een me once at the Commi&s;&s;ioner's hou&s;e, and that he afterwards &s;aw me come up to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, where he recollects my delivering to him the articles containing the final de|termination of the North Sea &s;quadron. I do declare, that I had no conver&s;ation with the Commi&s;&s;ioners, but left it entirely to them to &s;atisfy them&s;elves, that the articles I had pre&s;ented, really did contain the demands of that fleet. Capt. Surridge has declared, that he &s;aw no di&s;re&s;pect on my part towards him, therefore I &s;hall not dwell further on his evidence, but an&s;wer it in the general conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The next evidence is Capt. Dixon, of the L'E&s;pion, but as any ob&s;ervations in his evidence are an&s;wered by what I have ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to Admiral Buckner, and Capt. Surridge, I &s;hall decline commenting on it.</P>
<P>I now come to the evidence of Capt. John Wood, of the Hound, who has depo&s;ed, that I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt on board his &s;hip, and advi&s;ed him not to be &s;o violent. I cer|tainly did go on board, but I had no other motive than the per&s;onal &s;afety of the Captain, and the pre&s;ervation of the &s;hip. He &s;ays he was ordered out of his &s;hip, but he has never produced who ordered him out. In an&s;wer to this, I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ert I did not know that he was ordered to leave his &s;hip, the orders were not, certainly given by me, and though I have heard it in the Court, I never heard it in the &s;hip. As to my having &s;aid I would make a beef-&s;teak of the Pilot at the yard-arm, I &s;olemnly declare I did not make u&s;e of &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions. I do not recollect the Pilot's let|ting go the anchor. I declare to God I know nothing of it. If I was before the face of God, I would deny
<PB N="44" REF="032837_0043_0FF555451861DA10">
it. As to the yard ropes, they were reeved before I was on board. It is very po&s;&s;ible Capt. Wood might be mi&s;taken, as to my being the per&s;on who gave the order.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Flatt depo&s;es he does not know me. As I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to a&s;k Lieutenant Flatt &s;ome more que&s;tions, I &s;hall not make any further ob&s;erva|tions on his evidence, till he has been examined again.</P>
<P>Mr. Leving&s;ton, boat&s;wain of the Director, depo&s;es, that he &s;aw me on board the Director, at the time the Repul&s;e was on &s;hore, that I a&s;ked him for a boat, ob|&s;erving, that it might be the means of &s;aving many lives. He recollects my giving the word fire. After which, Mr. Samuel Hilliard depo&s;es, that he &s;aw me on board the Director, that he heard me addre&s;s the &s;hip's company, and that &s;oon after the guns were fir|ed, but that he did not hear me order it. In the fir&s;t place, in order to account for my being on board the Director&mdash;I only went on board to prevent the effu&s;ion of human blood. When the demands of the North Sea Fleet were known, a boat went round to the whole fleet, with a band of mu&s;ic, playing, God &s;ave the King, Rule Britannia, and Britons Strike Home; for which, were the &s;hip journals produced, they would prove it was the command of the whole &s;hip's com|pany. I was de&s;ired to be on that duty. Matthew Holli&s;ter informed me on board the Sandwich, that the Repul&s;e was getting under way, and that the Di|rector was getting a &s;pring on her cable. I was then commanded on board the Director. I &s;aw the guns on the quarter deck ca&s;t loo&s;e. I pointed out the impropriety and cruelty of one brother fighting again&s;t another; and I begged for a flag of truce, which was refu&s;ed. I then founded their di&s;po&s;itions, by propo&s;|ing to go along &s;ide the Repul&s;e; this I did, in order to &s;ee how far they would proceed; and I was happy to find they did not approve of &s;o doing. My rea&s;on for a&s;king for a flag of truce was, I thought if I could obtain permi&s;&s;ion to take it, none of the other &s;hips would fire on the Repul&s;e, out of re&s;pect to the flag of truce they had granted, but finding my&s;elf oppo&s;ed, I was obliged to act a part I abominated, and which,
<PB N="45" REF="032837_0044_0FF5554E200CC5E0">
to my grief, I &s;aw before I came on board. I do not recollect giving orders to fire; but if I did, they mu&s;t have been the orders of compul&s;ion, and not choice.</P>
<P>Thomas Barry, &s;eaman, depo&s;ed, I was on board the Monmouth; he mu&s;t have been greatly mi&s;taken in what he has related, but I will prove I was not at that time on board the Monmouth, that I was then on board the Director, and that he mu&s;t have confu&s;ed me with &s;ome other per&s;on. He depo&s;ed that I &s;aid FIRE, and that after the firing the &s;ixth or &s;eventh gun from the foreca&s;tle, that on the gun being loaded the &s;eventh time, I was not content with a nine pound &s;hot, but that I put a crowbar into the mouth of the gun. He relates &s;ome one being confined by a man called Capt. Vance. He al&s;o &s;wore that when the Repul&s;e got off, I &s;hook my fi&s;t, and &s;aid, "D&mdash;n me, &s;he's off, and that I &s;wore I would take one of the out&s;ide &s;hips, and &s;end her to Hell, where &s;he belonged to:" and on my a&s;king him what had been promi&s;ed to him for telling this helli&s;h &s;tory, he an&s;wered, "nothing had been promi&s;ed him." I do declare that I went on board the Sandwich in the Ardent's boat, and not in the manner de&s;cribed by Barry.</P>
<P>John Summerland does not recollect my working with my clothes off, but he &s;ays. I was on board the Monmouth. In fact, I was more in want of re&s;t, than anxious to look after Don Quixotte adventures. I did go on board the Monmouth it is certain, but with the &s;ame views I had in going on board the Director. As to my having &s;aid I would take an out|&s;ide &s;hip and repair to the Leopard, I could have no other motive for &s;o doing, than to make her keep her &s;tation. Some days previous to the Sandwich being delivered up, the Montague made a &s;ignal for a Dele|gate, I thought they were by no means amicable, with re&s;pect to their di&s;po&s;itions in general, and therefore, the &s;ignal was not complied with.</P>
<P>I have now made all the remarks which occur to me on the evidence. I now addre&s;s my&s;elf again to the Court, not for the purpo&s;e of intimating, that where mercy can be extended, it ought to be &s;hewn, being
<PB N="46" REF="032837_0045_0FF555513AF56DF8">
a&s;&s;ured that I &s;hall have &s;trict ju&s;tice; but I appeal to them to attend particularly to the evidence of Barry. However I may have been mi&s;repre&s;ented in the pub|lic prints, my intentions were good. My character is dearer to me than a thou&s;and lives. My country al|lows me ju&s;tice, and ju&s;tice I tru&s;t I &s;hall have from this honorable Court.</P>

The Court doth therefore adjudge him to &s;uffer <HI>DEATH,</HI> and he is ordered to &s;uffer death accordingly, at &s;uch time and place as the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Ad|miralty, or any three of them &s;hall direct and appoint.</P>
