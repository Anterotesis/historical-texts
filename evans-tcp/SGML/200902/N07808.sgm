<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PRESIDENT</HI> EDWARDS, in the e&s;teem of all the judicious, who were well acquainted with him, either per&s;onally, or by his writings, was one of the <HI>greate&s;t&mdash;be&s;t</HI>&mdash;and <HI>mo&s;t u&s;eful</HI> of men, that have lived in this age.</P>
<P>He di&s;cover'd him&s;elf to be one of the <HI>greate&s;t of di|vines,</HI> by his conver&s;ation, preaching and writings: One of remarkable &s;trength of mind, clearne&s;s of thought, and depth of penetration, who well under&s;tood, and was able, above mo&s;t others, to vindicate the great doctrines of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>And no one perhaps has been in our day, more uni|ver&s;ally e&s;teemed and acknowledged to be a <HI>bright chri&s;tian,</HI> an eminently <HI>good man.</HI> His love to God and man; his zeal for God and his cau&s;e; his up|rightne&s;s, humility, &s;elf-denial, and weanedne&s;s from the world; his clo&s;e walk with God; his con&s;cienti|ous, con&s;tant and univer&s;al obedience, in all exact and holy ways of living: In one word, the goodne&s;s, the holine&s;s of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s heart, has been as evident and con&s;pi|cuous, as the uncommon greatne&s;s and &s;trength of his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>And that this di&s;tingui&s;hed light has not &s;hone in vain, there are a cloud of witne&s;&s;es. God who gave him his great talents, led him into a way of improving them, both by preaching and writing, which has doubtle&s;s proved the means of converting many from the error of their ways; and of greatly promoting the
<PB REF="009961_0004_0F7B3F08C81127B0">
intere&s;t of Chri&s;t's church, both in <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> And there is rea&s;on to hope, that tho' he is now dead, he will yet &s;peak for a great whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> yet to come, to the great comfort and advantage of the church of Chri&s;t; that his publications will produce a yet greater harve&s;t, as an addition to his joy and crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord.</P>
<P>But the de&s;ign of the following memoirs, is not meer|ly to publi&s;h the&s;e things, and tell the world how emi|nently great, wi&s;e, holy and u&s;eful Pre&s;ident <HI>Edwards</HI> was; but rather to inform in what way, and by what means he attained to &s;uch an uncommon &s;tock of know|ledge and holine&s;s; and how, in the improvement of this, he did &s;o much good to mankind; that others may hereby be directed and excited to go and do likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>The reader is therefore not to expect a meer encomium on the <HI>dead,</HI> but a faithful and plain narration of mat|ters of fact, together with his own internal exerci&s;es, expre&s;s'd in his own words; and is de&s;ired not to look on the following compo&s;ure &s;o much an act of friend&s;hip to the <HI>dead,</HI> as of kindne&s;s to the <HI>living;</HI> it being only an attempt to render a life that has been greatly u&s;e|ful, yet more &s;o. And as this is de&s;igned for the rea|der's good, he is de&s;ired to remember, that if he gets no benefit hereby; is not made wi&s;er nor better, gains no &s;kill or di&s;po&s;ition to live an holy and u&s;eful life, all is in vain as to him.</P>
<P>IN this world, &s;o full of darkne&s;s and delu&s;ion, it is of great importance that all &s;hould be able to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between true religion and that which is fal&s;e. In this, perhaps none has taken more pains, or labour'd more &s;ucce&s;sfully, than he who&s;e life is &s;et before the reader. And it is pre&s;umed that his religious re&s;olu|tions, exerci&s;es and conduct here exhibited, will &s;erve well to exemplify and illu&s;trate all that he has wrote on
<PB REF="009961_0005_0F7B3F0978220A78">
this &s;ubject. Here pure and undefiled religion, in di&s;tinc|tion from all counterfeits, appears in life and practice, exhibiting a picture which will tend to in&s;truct, &s;trength|en and comfort all tho&s;e, who in their religious &s;enti|ments and exerci&s;es, are built on the foundation of the apo&s;tles and prophets, of which Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the chief corner &s;tone; while their hearts and practice in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;wer to it, as in water; face an&s;wer|eth to face. And here, they who have hitherto un|happily been in darkne&s;s and delu&s;ion, in this infinitely important affair, may have matter of in&s;truction and conviction.</P>
<P>This is a point about which, above many other, the prote&s;tant world is in the dark, and needs in&s;truction, as Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> was more and more convinced, the lon|ger he lived; and which he was wont frequently to ob&s;erve in conver&s;ation. If therefore the&s;e his remains are adapted to an&s;wer this end&punc; and may be con&s;idered as a word behind all to whom they &s;hall come, "&s;aying, THIS IS THE WAY, walk ye in it", and &s;hall in this view, be ble&s;&s;ed to many, it will be a relief under one of the greate&s;t calamities that attend the chri&s;tian world, and promote that important end, &s;o worthy the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tention and pur&s;uit of all; and in which he from whom this mantle falls, was zealou&s;ly engaged, and which he pur&s;ued to the end of his life.</P>
<P>In this view e&s;pecially, is the following life offered to the public, with an earne&s;t de&s;ire that every reader may faithfully improve it to this purpo&s;e; while he candidly overlooks any improprieties and defects which he may ob&s;erve to be chargeable on the compiler; who is he knows, in a great degree unequal to what is here attempted.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE Of the Reverend Mr. JONATHAN EDWARDS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I. Containing the Hi&s;tory of his Life, from his BIRTH, to his SETTLEMENT in the Work of the MINISTRY.</HEAD>
<P>_MR. JONATHAN EDWARDS was born <HI>October</HI> 5. 1703. at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> a Town in <HI>Connecticut.</HI> His Father was the Rev. Mr. TIMOTHY EDWARDS, Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel on the ea&s;t Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River in <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> He began to re&s;ide and preach at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> in <HI>November</HI> 1694 but was not ordained till <HI>July,</HI> 1698. He died <HI>Jan.</HI> 27. 1758. in the 89th Year of his Age, not two Months before this his SON. He was in the Work of the Mini&s;try above 59 Years: And from his fir&s;t beginning to re&s;ide and preach there, to his Death, are above 63 Years; and was able to attend on the Work of the Mini&s;try and preach con&s;tantly till within a few Years before his Death. He was very univer&s;ally e&s;teemed &amp; beloved as an upright, pious, exemplary Man, and faithful Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel; and was greatly u&s;eful. He was born at <HI>Hartford</HI> in <HI>Con|necticut, May</HI> 14. 1669, received the Honours of the Col|lege at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> by having the Degrees of Batchelor and Ma&s;ter of Arts given him the &s;ame Day, <HI>July</HI> 4. 1694, one in the Forenoon, and the other in the Afternoon.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="009961_0010_0F7B3F0EAA7CBD50">On the 6th Day of <HI>November</HI> 1694, he was married to Mrs. ESTHER STODDARD, in the 23d Year of her Age, the Daughter of the late famous Mr. SOLOMON STODDARD of <HI>Northampton;</HI> who&s;e great Parts and Zeal for experi|mental Religion are well known in all the Churches in <HI>America;</HI> and will probably be tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity yet unborn, by his valuable Writings. They lived together in the married State above 63 Years. Mrs. EDWARDS was born <HI>June</HI> 2. 1672, and is now living in her 89th Year, remarkable for the little decay of her mental Powers at &s;o great an Age.</P>
<P>THEY had eleven Children: All which lived to adult Years, viz ten Daughters, &s;even of whom are now living, and this their only Son and fifth Child.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As the following more large and particular Account, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> EDWARDS's Ance&s;tors may gratify &s;ome Readers, 'tis in&s;erted here in the Margin.</P>
<P>Mr. EDWARDS's Grandfather was Mr. RICHARD EDWARDS. His fir&s;t Wife was Mrs. ELISABETH TUTTLE, Daughter of Mr. WILLIAM TUTTLE of <HI>New-Haven</HI> in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and Mrs. ELIS. TUTTLE his Wife, who came out of Northam|ton&s;hire in <HI>England.</HI> His &s;econd Wife was Mrs. TALCOT, Si&s;ter to Governor TALCOT: By his fir&s;t Wife he had &s;even Children, the olde&s;t of which was the Rev. Mr. TIMOTHY EDWARDS of <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> his Father, before mentioned. By his &s;econd Wife Mrs. <HI>Talcot,</HI> he had &s;ix Children</P>
<P>The Father of Mr. RICHARD EDWARDS was Mr. WILLIAM EDWARDS, who came from <HI>England</HI> young and unmarried. His Wife, Mrs. AGNES EDWARDS, who al&s;o came out of <HI>England,</HI> had two Brothers in <HI>England,</HI> one of them Mayor of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and the other of <HI>Barn&s;table.</HI> Mr. WM. EDWARDS's Father was the Rev. Mr. RICH. EDWARDS, Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel in <HI>London.</HI> He lived in Queen ELISABETH's Day, and his Wife Mrs ANNE EDWARDS a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making a Ruff for the Queen. After the Death of Mr. EDWARDS &s;he mar|ried to one Mr. JAMES COLE. She with her &s;econd Hu&s;band, and her Son WM. EDWARDS came into <HI>America,</HI> and all died at <HI>Hartford</HI> in <HI>Connecticut.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. EDWARDS's Grandfather, (Mr. SOLOMON STODDARD, and his Predece&s;&s;or at <HI>Northampton</HI>) married Mrs. MATHER, the Relict of the Rev Mr. MATHER his Predece&s;&s;or, and the fir&s;t Mini&s;ter at <HI>Northampton.</HI> Her maiden Name was ESTHER WARHAM, Daughter and younge&s;t Child of the Rev.

<P>Mrs. ESTHER WARHAM had three Children by Mr MATHER, viz. <HI>Eunice, Warham</HI> and <HI>Eliakim.</HI> And &s;he had twelve Chil|dren by Mr. STO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">DARD, &s;ix Sons and &s;ix Daughters: Three of the Sons died in Infancy. The three that liv'd to adult Years were <HI>Anthony, John</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael. I&s;rael</HI> died in Pri&s;on in <HI>France. Anthony</HI> was the Rev. Mr. ANTHONY STODDARD, late Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel at <HI>Woodbury</HI> in <HI>Connecticut.</HI> who lived to a great Age, and was in the Work of the Mini&s;try 60 Years: He died <HI>Sept</HI> 6 1760, in the 82d Year of his Age. <HI>John</HI> was the honourable JOHN STODDARD, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who lived at <HI>Northampton,</HI> and who often, e&s;pecially in his younger Years, &s;erved the Town as their Repre&s;entative at the Great and General Court in <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> and was long Head of the Country of <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> as their chief Colonel, and chief Judge of the Court of Common Pleas: And he long &s;erved His Maje&s;ty, and the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> as one of his Maje&s;ty's Council. He was re|markable as a Politician, and for his Spirit of Government; a wi&s;e Coun&s;ellor, an upright and &s;kilful Judge, a &s;teady and great Friend to the Intere&s;t of Religion. He was a great Friend and Admirer of Mr <HI>Edwards,</HI> and greatly &s;trengthen'd his Hands in the Work of the Mini&s;try while he lived. A more particular Account of the Life and Character of this truly great Man may be &s;een in the Sermon which Mr. <HI>Ed|wards</HI> preach'd and publi&s;hed on the Occa&s;ion of his Death.</P>
<P>Mr STODDARD's Father was ANTHONY STODDARD, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> a zealous congregational Man. He had five Wives, the fir&s;t of which, Mr. STODDARD's Mother, was Mrs. MARY DOWNING, Si&s;ter to Sir GEORGE DOWNING, who&s;e other Si&s;ter married Governor BRADSTREET.

uncommon Genius, by which he was, as it were by Na|ture, form'd for clo&s;ene&s;s of Thought and deep Penetra|tion, now began to exerci&s;e and di&s;cover it &s;elf. Taking that Book into his Hand, upon &s;ome Occa&s;ion, not long before his Death, he &s;aid to &s;ome of his &s;elect Friends, who were then with him. That he was beyond Expre&s;&s;ion extertain'd and pleas'd with it, when he read it in his Youth at College; that he was as much engaged, and had more Satisfaction and Plea&s;ure in &s;tudying it, than the mo&s;t greedy Mi&s;er in gathering up handfuls of Silver and Gold from &s;ome new di&s;covered Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THO' he made good Proficiency in all the Arts and Sciences, and had an uncommon Ta&s;te for natural Philo|&s;ophy, which he cultivated to the end of his Life, with that ju&s;tne&s;s and accuracy of Thought which was almo&s;t peculiar to him; yet moral Philo&s;ophy or Divinity w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his favourite Study. In this he early made great Progre&s;s.</P>
<P>HE lived at College near two Years after he took his fir&s;t Degree, de&s;igning and preparing for the Work of the Mini|&s;try. After which, having pa&s;&s;ed the pre-requi&s;ite Trials, he was licenced to preach the Go&s;pel as a Candidate. And being pitched upon, and applied to by a Number of Mini|&s;ters in <HI>New-England,</HI> who were intru&s;ted to act in Behalf of the Engli&s;h Pre&s;byterians at <HI>New-York,</HI> as a fit Per&s;on to be &s;ent to them, he complied with their Reque&s;t, and went to <HI>New-York</HI> the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1722; and preach'd there to very good Acceptance about eight Months But by Rea&s;on of the Smallne&s;s of that Society, and &s;ome &s;pe|cial Difficulties that attended it, he did not think they were in a Capacity to &s;ettle a Mini&s;ter, with a rational Pro&s;pect of an&s;wering the good Ends propo&s;ed. He therefore left them, the next Spring, and retired to his Father's Hou&s;e; where he &s;pent the Summer in clo&s;e Study. He was indeed earne&s;tly &s;olicited by the People he had been among at <HI>New-York</HI> to return to them again; but for the Rea&s;on ju&s;t mentioned, he could not think him&s;elf in the way of his Duty to gratify them.</P>
<P>IN <HI>September,</HI> 1723, he received his Degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts; about which time he had Invitations from &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cial Congregations to come among them in order to his Set+tlement

<P>WHILE he was in this Place, he was applied to by the People at <HI>Northampton,</HI> with an Invitation to come and &s;ettle in the Work of the Mini&s;try there, with his Grand|father STODDARD, who by Rea&s;on of his great Age, &s;too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in need of A&s;&s;i&s;tance.

<P>BETWEEN the Time of his going to <HI>New-York</HI> and his Settlement at <HI>Northampton,</HI> he formed a Number of Re&s;o|lutions, and committed them to Writing: the particular Time, and &s;pecial Occa&s;ion of his making many of them, he has noted in his Diary which he then kept; as well as many other Ob&s;ervations and Rules, which related to his own Exerci&s;es and Conduct. And as the&s;e Re&s;olu|tions, together with the Things noted in his Diary, may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered, as the Foundation and Plan of his whole Life, it may be proper here to give the Reader a Ta&s;te and Idea of them: which will therefore be done in the following Extracts.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. Extracts from his PRIVATE DIARY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>"SAturday, December</HI> 22. 1722. This Day revived by God's Spirit. Affected with the Sen&s;e of the excel|lency of Holine&s;s. Felt more exerci&s;e of Love to Chri&s;t than u&s;ual. Have al&s;o felt &s;en&s;ible Repentance of Sin, becau&s;e it was committed again&s;t &s;o merciful and good a God. This Night made the 37th Re&s;olution.</P>
<P><HI>Sabbath Day-Night, Dec.</HI> 23. Made the 38th Re&s;olution.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, Dec.</HI> 24. Higher Thoughts than u&s;ual of the Excellency of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, January</HI> 2 1722, 3. Dull. I find by Experi|ence, that let me make Re&s;olutions, and do what I will, with never &s;o many Inventions, it is all nothing, and to no Purpo&s;e at all, without the Motions of the Spirit of God: for if the Spirit of God &s;hould be as much with|drawn from me always, as for the Week pa&s;t, notwith|&s;tanding all I do, I &s;hould not grow; but &s;hould lan|gui&s;h, and mi&s;erably fade away &mdash; There is no Depen|dence upon my &s;elf. It is to no Purpo&s;e to re&s;olve, ex|cept we depend on the Grace of God; for if it were not for his meer Grace, one might be a very good Man one Day, and a very wicked one the next.</P>
<P><HI>Sabbath-Day, Jan.</HI> 6. at Night. Much concerned about the improvement of precious Time. Intend to live in conti|nual Mortification, without cea&s;ing, as long as in this World.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Jan.</HI> 8. in the Morning. Higher Thoughts than u&s;ual, of the Excellency of Chri&s;t, and felt an unu&s;ual Re|pentance of Sin therefrom.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, Jan.</HI> 9. at Night. Decayed. I am &s;ometimes apt to think, I have a great deal more of Holine&s;s than I have. I find now and then, that abominable Corruption which is directly contrary to what I read of eminent Chri&s;tians.&mdash; How deceitful is my Heart! I take up a &s;trong Re&s;olution, but how &s;oon does it weaken!</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Jan.</HI> 10. about Noon. Reviving. 'Tis a great Di&s;honour to Chri&s;t, in whom I hope I have an Intere&s;t, to be unea&s;y at my worldly State and Condition. When I &s;ee the Pro&s;perity of others, and that all Things go ea&s;y with them; the World is &s;mooth to them, and they are

happy in many Re&s;pects, and very pro&s;perous, or are ad|vanced to much Honour &amp;c. to grudge and envy them, or be the lea&s;t unea&s;y at it; to wi&s;h or long for the &s;ame Pro&s;perity, and that it would ever be &s;o with me. Where|fore concluded always to rejoyce in every one's Pro&s;perity, and to expect for my &s;elf no Happine&s;s of that Nature as long as I live; but depend upon Afflictions, and betake my &s;elf entirely to another Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I think I find my &s;elf much more &s;prightly and healthy, both in Body and Mind, for my Self-denial in eating, drinking, and &s;leeping.</P>
<P>I think it would be advantageous every Morning to con&s;ider my Bu&s;ine&s;s and Temptations; and what Sins I &s;hall be expo&s;ed to that Day&punc; and to make a Re&s;olution how to improve the Day, and to avoid tho&s;e Sins. And &s;o at the beginning of every Week, Month and Year.</P>
<P>I never knew before what was meant by not &s;etting our Hearts upon the&s;e Things. 'Tis, not to care about them, to depend upon them, to afflict our &s;elves much with Fears of lo&s;ing them, nor plea&s;e our &s;elves with Expecta|tion of obtaining them, or hope of the Continuance of them At Night made the 41&s;t Re&s;olution.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Jan.</HI> 12. in the Morning. I have this Day &s;olemnly renewed my bapti&s;mal Covenant and Self-Dedi|cation, which I renewed when I was received into the Communion of the Church. I have been before God; and have given my &s;elf, all that I am and have to GOD, &s;o that I am not in any Re&s;pect my own: I can challenge no Right in my &s;elf, I can challenge no Right in this Un|der&s;tanding, this Will, the&s;e Affections that are in me; neither have I any right to this Body, or any of its Members: No Right to this Tongue, the&s;e Hands, nor Feet: no Right to the&s;e Sen&s;es, the&s;e Eyes, the&s;e Ears, this Smell or Ta&s;te. I have given my &s;elf clear away, and have not retained any Thing as my own. I have been to GOD this Morning, and told Him that I gave my &s;elf <HI>wholly</HI> to him. I have given every Power to him; &s;o that for the future I will challenge no Right in my &s;elf, in any Re&s;pect. I have expre&s;ly promi|&s;ed Him, and do now promi&s;e Almighty God, that by his Grace I will not. I have this Morning told Him, that I did take Him for my whole Portion and Felicity, looking on nothing el&s;e as any Part of my Happine&s;s, nor acting as if it were; and his Law for the con&s;tant

Rule of my Obedience: and would fight with all my Might again&s;t the World, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil, to the End of my Life. And did believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and re|ceive him as a Prince and a Saviour; and would adhere to the Faith and Obedience of the Go&s;pel, how hazar|dous and difficult &s;oever the Profe&s;&s;ion and Practice of it may be. That I did receive the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit as my Tea|cher, Sanctifier and only Comforter; and cheri&s;h all his Motions to enlighten, purify, confirm, comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t me. This I have done. And I pray God, for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, to look upon it as a Self-Dedication; and to re|ceive me now as entirely his own, and deal with me in all Re&s;pects as &s;uch; whether he afflicts me or pro&s;pers me, or whatever he plea&s;es to do with me, who am his. Now, henceforth I am not to act in any Re&s;pect as my own.&mdash; I &s;hall act as my own, if I ever make u&s;e of any of my Powers to any thing that is not to the glory of God, and don't make the glorifying Him my whole and entire Bu&s;ine&s;s; if I murmur in the lea&s;t at Afflictions; if I grieve at the Pro&s;perity of others; if I am any way uncharitable; if I am angry becau&s;e of Injuries; if I revenge: If I do any thing, purely to plea&s;e my &s;elf, or if I avoid any thing for the &s;ake of my Ea&s;e: If I omit any thing becau&s;e it is great Self-denial: If I tru&s;t to my &s;elf: If I take any of the Prai&s;e of any Good that I do, or rather GOD does by me; or if I am any way proud.</P>
<P>This Day made the 42d and 43d Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, Jan.</HI> 14 &mdash; The Dedication I made of my &s;elf to my God, on Saturday la&s;t, has been exceeding u&s;eful to me. I thought I had a more &s;piritual in&s;ight into the Scripture, reading the 8th Chapter to the <HI>Romans,</HI> than ever in my Life before.</P>
<P>Great In&s;tances of Mortification are deep Wounds given to the Body of Sin, hard Bows that make him &s;tagger and reel: we thereby get great Ground and footing again&s;t him.&mdash;While we live without great In&s;tances of Morti|fication and Self-denial, the old Man keeps whereabouts he was; for he is &s;turdy and ob&s;tinate, and will not &s;tir for &s;mall Blows. After the greate&s;t Mortifications, I always find the greate&s;t Comfort.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing there was never but one compleat Chri&s;tian, in all Re&s;pects of a right Stamp, having Chri&s;tianity &s;hin|ing in its true Lu&s;tre, at a time in the World; Re&s;olved

to act ju&s;t as I would do, if I &s;trove with all my Might to be that One, that &s;hould be in my Time.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Jan.</HI> 15. It &s;eemed Ye&s;terday, the Day before and Saturday, that I &s;hould always retain the &s;ame Re&s;o|lutions to the &s;ame Height, but alas, how &s;oon do I decay! O, how weak, how infirm, how unable to do any thing am I! What a poor, incon&s;i&s;tent, what a mi&s;erable Wretch, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's Spirit! While I &s;tand, I am ready to think I &s;tand in my own Strength, and upon my own Legs; and I am ready to triumph over my Enemies, as if it were I my &s;elf that cau&s;ed them to flee: when alas! I am but a poor Infant, upheld by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who holds me up, and gives me Liberty to &s;mile to &s;ee my Enemies flee, when he drives them before me; and &s;o I laugh, as tho' I my &s;elf did it, when it is only Je&s;us Chri&s;t leads me along, and fights Him&s;elf again&s;t my Ene|mies. And now the Lord has a little left me, and how weak do I find my &s;elf! O, let it teach me to depend le&s;s on my &s;elf, to be more humble, and to give more of the prai&s;e of my Ability to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The Heart of Man is deceitful above all Things, and de&s;perately wicked, who can know it?</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Febr.</HI> 16 I do certainly know that I love Ho|line&s;s, &s;uch as the Go&s;pel requires.</P>

The Plea&s;ures of Humility are really the mo&s;t refined, inward and exqui&s;ite Delights in the World. How hateful is a proud Man! How hateful is a Worm that lifts up it &s;elf with Pride!

<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, May</HI> 1. Forenoon. La&s;t Night I came Home, after my melancholy parting from <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>I have always, in every different State of Life, I have hitherto been in, thought the Troubles and Difficulties of that State, to be greater than tho&s;e of any other, that I propo&s;ed to be in; and when I have altered with a&s;&s;urance of mending my &s;elf, I have &s;till thought the &s;ame; yea, that the Difficulties of that State, are greater than tho&s;e of that I left la&s;t. Lord, grant that from hence I may learn to withdraw my Thoughts, Affections, De&s;ires and Expectations, intirely from the World, and may fix them upon the heavenly State; where there is fulne&s;s of Joy; where reigns heavenly, &s;weet, calm and delightful Love without Alloy; where there are continually the deare&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of their Love: where there is the Enjoyment of the Per&s;ons loved, without ever parting: where tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who appear &s;o lovely in this World, will really be inexpre&s;&s;ibly more lovely, and full of Love to us. How &s;weetly will the mutual Lovers join together to &s;ing the Prai&s;es of God and the Lamb! How full will it fill us with Joy to think, this Enjoyment, the&s;e &s;weet Exerci&s;es, will never cea&s;e or come to an End, but will la&s;t to all Eternity.</P>

<P><HI>Saturday Night, May</HI> 4.

<HEAD>SECTION III. REFLECTION <HI>on the foregoing</HI> EXTRACTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE foregoing Extracts were wrote by Mr. EDWARDS in the 20th and 21&s;t Years of his Age, as appears by the Dates. This being kept in Mind, the judi|cious Reader will make proper Allowance for &s;ome Things, which may appear a little Juvenile, or like a young Chri&s;tian, as to the Matter, or Manner of Expre&s;&s;ion; which would not have been found, had it not have been done in early Life. Which, indeed are no Blemi&s;hes, the whole being taken together: as by this, it appears more natural, and the Strength of his Re&s;olution, and fervor of Mind; and his Skill and Di&s;cerning in divine Things, &s;o &s;eldom found even in old Age, are the more &s;triking. And in this View, we &s;hall be led to admire his con&s;ci|entious Strictne&s;s, his Zeal and Painfulne&s;s, his Experience and Judgment in true Religion, at &s;o early an Age. For here are not only the mo&s;t convincing Evidences of Sincerity and thorough Religion, of his engaging in a Life devoted to GOD in good earne&s;t, &s;o as to make Religion his only Bu&s;ine&s;s; but thro' his great Attention to this Matter, he appears to have the Judgment and Experience of grey Hairs.</P>
<P>THIS is the Beginning of a Life &s;o eminently holy &amp; u&s;eful as Mr. EDWARDS's was. He who became one of the great|e&s;t Divines in this Age; has had the Applau&s;e and Admira|tion of <HI>America, Britain, Holland,</HI> &amp; <HI>Germany,</HI> for his Piety, and great Judgment &amp; Skill in Divinity; and has been honored above mo&s;t others in the Chri&s;tian World, in this Century;
<PB N="22" REF="009961_0030_0F7B3F1F39844DE0">
in his being made the In&s;trument of doing &s;o much good: HE began his Life thus: He enter'd on a publick Life with &s;uch Views, &s;uch Exerci&s;es, &s;uch Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>THIS may &s;erve as a Direction and Excitement to tho&s;e who are Young, to devote them&s;elves to GOD in good ear|ne&s;t, and enter on the Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;trict and thorough Re|ligion without delay: e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are looking to|wards the Work of the Mini&s;try, as they would take the mo&s;t direct, the only Way to an&s;wer the good Ends which they profe&s;s to &s;eek.</P>
<P>IT is to be lamented, that there is &s;o much Rea&s;on to think, there are &s;o few In&s;tances of &s;uch early Piety in our Day. If the prote&s;tant World abounded with young Per|&s;ons of this Stamp; with young Men, who were prepar|ing for the Work of the Mini&s;try, with &s;uch a Temper, &s;uch Exerci&s;es, and &s;uch Re&s;olutions, what a delightful Pro&s;pect would this afford, of the near approach of happier Days, than the Church of GOD has ever yet &s;een! What plea&s;ing Hopes that the great, the merciful Head of the Church, was about to &s;end forth Labourers, faithful, &s;uc|ce&s;sful Labourers into his Harve&s;t; and ble&s;s his People with "Pa&s;tors which &s;hall teach them with Knowledge and Under&s;tanding!"</P>
<P>BUT if our Youth neglect all proper Improvement of the Mind; are &s;hy of Seriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trict Piety; choo&s;e to live Strangers to it, and keep at a Di&s;tance from all Appearance of it; are wanton, and given to carnal Plea|&s;ures; what a gloomy Pro&s;pect does this afford! If they who enter into the Work of the Mini&s;try; from a gay, carele&s;s, and what may ju&s;tly be called a vicious Life, be|take them&s;elves to a little &s;uperficial &s;tudy of Divinity, and &s;oon begin to preach; while all the external Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Zeal they put on, is only from worldly Motives; they being without any inward, experimental Acquaintance with &s;piritual, divine Things, and even &s;o much as any Ta&s;te for true Divinity; no wonder if the Churches "&s;uck dry Brea&s;ts"; and there are many ignorant Watchmen</P>
<P>BUT, as the be&s;t Comment on the foregoing Re&s;olutions and Diary; and that the Reader may have a more parti|cular, full and in&s;tructive View of Mr. EDWARDS's En|trance on a religious Life, and Progre&s;s in it, as con&s;i&s;ting in the Views and Exerci&s;es of his Mind; a brief Account

<HEAD>SECTION IV. <HI>An Account of his</HI> CONVERSION, EXPERIENCES, <HI>and</HI> RELIGIOUS EXERCICES, <HI>given by him&s;elf.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Had a variety of Concerns and Exerci&s;es about my Soul from my Childhood; but had two more remarka|ble Sea&s;ons of Awakening, before I met with that Change, by which I was brought to tho&s;e new Di&s;po&s;itions, and that new Sen&s;e of Things, that I have &s;ince had. The fir&s;t Time was when I was a Boy, &s;ome Years before I went to College, at a Time of remarkable Awakening in my Father's Congregation. I was then very much affected for many Months, and concerned about the Things of Religion, and my Soul's Salvation; and was abundant in Duties. I u&s;ed to pray five times a Day in &s;ecret, and to &s;pend much Time in religious Talk with other Boys; and u&s;ed to meet with them to pray together. I experienced I know not what Kind of Delight in Religion. My Mind was much engaged in it, and had much &s;elf-righteous Plea|&s;ure; and it was my Delight to abound in religious Duties. I, with &s;ome of my School-mates joined together, and built a Booth in a Swamp, in a very &s;ecret and retired Place, for a place of Prayer. And be&s;ides, I had particular &s;ecret Pla|ces of my own in the Woods, where I u&s;ed to retire by my &s;elf; and u&s;ed to be from time to time much affected. My Affections &s;eemed to be lively and ea&s;ily moved, and I &s;eemed to be in my Element, when engaged in religious Duties. And I am ready to think, many are deceived with &s;uch Affections, and &s;uch a kind of Delight, as I then had in Religion, and mi&s;take it for Grace.</P>
<P>"BUT in proce&s;s of Time, my Convictions and Affecti|ons wore off; and I entirely lo&s;t all tho&s;e Affections and Delights, and left off &s;ecret Prayer, at lea&s;t as to any con|&s;tant Performance of it; and returned like a Dog to his Vomit, and went on in Ways of Sin.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="009961_0032_0F7B3F2220189168">"INDEED, I was at &s;ome Times very unea&s;y, e&s;pecially to|wards the latter Part of the Time of my being at College. 'Till it pleas'd GOD, in my la&s;t Year at College, at a Time when I was in the mid&s;t of many unea&s;y Thoughts about the State of my Soul, to &s;eize me with a Pleuri&s;y; in which he brought me nigh to the Grave, and &s;hook me over the Pit of Hell.</P>
<P>"BUT yet, it was not long after my Recovery, before I fell again into my old Ways of Sin. But God would not &s;uffer me to go on with any Quietne&s;s; but I had great and violent inward Struggles: 'till after many Conflicts with wicked Inclinations, and repeated Re&s;olutions, and Bonds that I laid my &s;elf under by a kind of Vows to God, I was brought wholly to break off all former wicked Ways, and all Ways of known outward Sin; and to apply my &s;elf to &s;eek my Salvation, and practi&s;e the Duties of Religion: But without that kind of Affection and Delight, that I had formerly experienced. My Concern now wrought more by inward Struggles and Conflicts, and Self-reflections. I made &s;eeking my Salvation the main Bu&s;ine&s;s of my Life. But yet it &s;eems to me, I &s;ought after a mi&s;erable manner: Which has made me &s;ome times &s;ince to que&s;tion, whether ever it i&s;&s;ued in that which was &s;aving; being ready to doubt, whether &s;uch mi&s;erable &s;eeking was ever &s;ucceeded. But yet I was brought to &s;eek Salvation, in a manner that I never was before. I felt a Spirit to part with all Things in the World, for an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. My Concern con|tinued and prevailed, with many exerci&s;ing Things and in|ward Struggles; but yet it never &s;eemed to be proper to expre&s;s my Concern that I had, by the Name of Terror.</P>
<P>"FROM my Childhood up, my Mind had been wont to be full of Objections again&s;t the Doctrine of GOD's So|vereignty, in choo&s;ing whom he would to eternal Life, and rejecting whom he plea&s;ed; leaving them eternally to peri&s;h, and be everla&s;tingly tormented in Hell. It u&s;ed to appear like a horrible Doctrine to me. But I remember the Time very well, when I &s;eemed to be convinced, and fully &s;atisfied, as to this Sovereignty of God, and his Ju&s;tice in thus eternally di&s;po&s;ing of Men, according to his &s;overeign Plea&s;ure. But never could give an Acccount, how, or by what Means&punc; I was thus convinced; not in the lea&s;t ima|gining, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Time of it, nor a long Time after, that
<PB N="25" REF="009961_0033_0F7B3F23473039A8">
there was any extraordinary Influence of God's Spirit in it: but only that now I &s;aw further, and my Rea&s;on appre|hended the Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;onablene&s;s of it. However, my Mind re&s;ted in it; and it put an end to all tho&s;e Cavils and Objections, that had 'till then abode with me, all the pre|ceeding part of my Life. And there has been a wonder|ful Alteration in my Mind, with re&s;pect to the Doctrine of God's Sovereignty, from that Day to this; &s;o that I &s;carce ever have found &s;o much as the ri&s;ing of an Objection a|gain&s;t God's Sovereignty, in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute Sen&s;e, in &s;hewing Mercy on whom he will &s;hew Mercy, and har|dening and eternally damning whom he will. God's ab|&s;olute Sovereignty, and Ju&s;tice, with re&s;pect to Salvation and Damnation, is what my Mind &s;eems to re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of, as much as of any Thing that I &s;ee with my Eyes; at lea&s;t it is &s;o at Times. But I have often times &s;ince that fir&s;t Conviction, had quite another Kind of Sen&s;e of God's So|vereignty, than I had then. I have often &s;ince, not only had a Conviction, but a <HI>delightful</HI> Conviction. The Doct|rine of God's Sovereignty has very often appeared, an ex|ceeding plea&s;ant, bright and &s;weet Doctrine to me: and ab&s;olute Sovereignty is what I love to a&s;cribe to God. But my fir&s;t Conviction was not with this.</P>
<P>"THE fir&s;t that I remember that ever I found any thing of that Sort of inward, &s;weet Delight in GOD and di|vine Things, that I have lived much in &s;ince, was on reading tho&s;e Words, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 17. "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invi&s;ible, the only wi&s;e GOD, be Honor and Glory for ever and ever, Amen." As I read the Words, there came into my Soul, and was as it were diffu&s;ed thro' it, a Sen&s;e of the Glory of the Divine Being; a new Sen&s;e, quite different from any Thing I ever expe|rienced before. Never any Words of Scripture &s;eemed to me as the&s;e Words did. I thought with my &s;elf, how ex|cellent a Being that was; and how happy I &s;hould be, if I might enjoy that GOD, and be wrapt up to GOD in Heaven, and be as it were &s;wallowed up in Him. I kept &s;aying, and as it were &s;inging over the&s;e Words of Scrip|ture to my &s;elf; and went to Prayer, to pray to GOD that I might enjoy him; and prayed in a manner quite different from what I u&s;ed to do; with a new &s;ort of Affection. But it never came into my Thought, that there was any thing &s;piritual, or of a &s;aving Nature in this.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="009961_0034_0F7B3F23C2A12050">"FROM about that Time, I began to have a new Kind of Apprehen&s;ions and Ideas of Chri&s;t, and the Work of Redemption, and the glorious Way of Salvation by him. I had an inward, &s;weet Sen&s;e of the&s;e Things, that at times came into my Heart; and my Soul was led away in plea|&s;ant Views and Contemplations of them. And my Mind was greatly engaged, to &s;pend my Time in reading and meditating on Chri&s;t; and the Beauty and Excellency of his Per&s;on, and the lovely Way of Salvation, by free Grace in him. I found no Books &s;o delightful to me, as tho&s;e that treated of the&s;e Subjects. Tho&s;e Words <HI>Cant.</HI> ii. 1. u&s;ed to be abundantly with me: <HI>I am the Ro&s;e of Sharon, the Lilly of the Valleys.</HI> The Words &s;eemed to me, &s;weetly to repre&s;ent, the Loveline&s;s and Beauty of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And the whole Book of Canticles u&s;ed to be plea&s;ant to me; and I u&s;ed to be much in reading it, about that time. And found, from Time to Time, an inward Sweetne&s;s, that u&s;ed, as it were, to carry me away in my Contemplations; in what I know not how to expre&s;s otherwi&s;e, than by a calm, &s;weet Ab&s;traction of Soul from all the Concerns <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o this World; and a kind of Vi&s;ion, or fix'd Ideas and Ima|ginations, of being alone in the Mountains, or &s;ome &s;oli|tary Wilderne&s;s, far from all Mankind, &s;weetly conver&s;ing with Chri&s;t, and wrapt and &s;wallowed up in GOD. The Sen&s;e I had of divine Things, would often of a &s;udden as it were, kindle up a &s;weet burning in my Heart; an ardor of my Soul, that I know not how to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>"NOT long after I fir&s;t began to experience the&s;e Things, I gave an Account to my Father, of &s;ome Things that had pa&s;s'd in my Mind. I was pretty much affected by the Di&s;cour&s;e we had together. And when the Di&s;cour&s;e was ended, I walked abroad alone, in a &s;olitary Place in my Father's Pa&s;ture, for Contemplation. And as I was walk|ing there, and looked up on the Sky and Clouds; there came into my Mind, a &s;weet Sen&s;e of the glorious Maje&s;ty and Grace of GOD, that I know not how to expre&s;s. I &s;eemed to &s;ee them both in a &s;weet Conjunction: Maje&s;ty and Meekne&s;s join'd together: it was a &s;weet and gentle, and holy Maje&s;ty; and al&s;o a maje&s;tick Meekne&s;s; an aw|ful Sweetne&s;s; a high, and great, and holy Gentlene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="009961_0035_0F7B3F248067FD18">"AFTER this my Sen&s;e of divine Things gradually in|crea&s;ed, and became more and more lively, and had more of that inward Sweetne&s;s. The Appearance of every thing was altered: there &s;eem'd to be, as it were, a calm, &s;weet Ca&s;t, or Appearance of divine Glory, in almo&s;t every Thing. God's Excellency, his Wi&s;dom, his Purity and Love, &s;eem|ed to appear in every Thing; in the Sun, Moon and Stars; in the Clouds, and blue Sky; in the Gra&s;s, Flowers, Trees; in the Water, and all Nature; which u&s;ed greatly to fix my Mind. I often u&s;ed to &s;it &amp; view the Moon, for a long time; and &s;o in the Day time, &s;pent much time in viewing the Clouds &amp; Sky, to behold the &s;weet Glory of GOD in the&s;e Things: in the mean Time, &s;inging forth with a low Voice, my Contemplations of the Creator &amp; Redeemer. And &s;carce any Thing, among all the Works of Nature, was &s;o &s;weet to me as Thunder and Lightning. Formerly, nothing had been &s;o terrible to me. I u&s;ed to be a Per&s;on uncommon|ly terrified with Thunder: and it u&s;ed to &s;trike me with Terror, when I &s;aw a Thunder-&s;torm ri&s;ing. But now, on the contrary, it rejoyced me. I felt GOD at the fir&s;t Appea|rance of a Thunder-&s;torm. And u&s;ed to take the Oppor|tunity at &s;uch Times, to fix my &s;elf to view the Clouds, and &s;ee the Lightnings play, and hear the maje&s;tick &amp; awful Voice of God's Thunder: which often times was exceeding en|tertaining, leading me to &s;weet Contemplations of my great and glorious GOD. And while I viewed, u&s;ed to &s;pend my time, as it always &s;eem'd natural to me, to &s;ing or chant forth my Meditations; to &s;peak my Thoughts in Soliloquies, and &s;peak with a &s;inging Voice.</P>
<P>"I felt then a great Satisfaction as to my good E&s;tate. But that did not content me. I had vehement Longings of Soul after GOD and CHRIST, and after more Holine&s;s; wherewith my Heart &s;eemed to be full, and ready to break: which often brought to my Mind, the Words of the P&s;al|mi&s;t, P&s;al. cxix. 28. <HI>My Soul breaketh for the Longing it hath.</HI> I often felt a mourning and lamenting in my Heart, that I had not turned to GOD &s;ooner, that I might have had more time to grow in Grace. My Mind was greatly fix'd on divine Things; I was almo&s;t perpetually in the Con|templation of them. Spent mo&s;t of my Time in thinking of divine Things, Year after Year. And u&s;ed to &s;pend abundance of my Time, in walking alone in the Woods, and &s;olitary Places, for Meditation, Soliloquy and Prayer, and
<PB N="28" REF="009961_0036_0F7B3F2547C1EA88">
Conver&s;e with GOD. And it was always my Manner, at &s;uch times, to &s;ing forth my Contemplations. And was almo&s;t con&s;tantly in ejaculatory Prayer, wherever I was. Prayer &s;eem'd to be natural to me; as the Breath, by which the inward Burnings of my Heart had vent.</P>
<P>"THE Delights which I now felt in Things of Religion, were of an exceeding different Kind, from tho&s;e foremen|tioned, that I had when I was a Boy. They were totally of another Kind; and what I then had no more Notion or Idea of, than one born blind has of plea&s;ant and beautiful Colours. They were of a more inward, pure, Soul-anima|ting and refre&s;hing Nature. Tho&s;e former Delights, never reached the Heart; and did not ari&s;e from any Sight of the divine Excellency of the Things of GOD; or any Ta&s;te of the Soul-&s;atisfying, and Life-giving Good, there is in them.</P>
<P>"MY &s;en&s;e of divine Things &s;eem'd gradually to in|crea&s;e, 'till I went to preach at <HI>New-York;</HI> which was about a Year and a half after they began. While I was there, I felt them, very &s;en&s;ibly, in a much higher Degree, than I had done before. My Longings after GOD &amp; Holine&s;s, were much increa&s;ed. Pure and humble, holy and hea|venly Chri&s;tianity, appeared exceeding amiable to me. I felt in me a burning De&s;ire to be in every Thing a com|pleat Chri&s;tian; and conformed to the ble&s;&s;ed Image of Chri&s;t: and that I might live in all Things, according to the pure, &s;weet and ble&s;&s;ed Rules of the Go&s;pel. I had an eager thir&s;ting after Progre&s;s in the&s;e Things. My Long|ings after it, put me upon pur&s;uing and pre&s;&s;ing after them. It was my continual Strife Day and Night, and con&s;tant Inquiry, How I &s;hould be more holy, and live more holily, and more becoming a Child of God, and Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t. I &s;ought an encrea&s;e of Grace and Holine&s;s, and that I might live an holy Life, with va&s;tly more Earne&s;tne&s;s, than ever I &s;ought Grace, before I had it. I u&s;ed to be conti|nually examining my &s;elf, and &s;tudying and contriving for likely Ways and Means, how I &s;hould live holily, with far greater diligence and earne&s;tne&s;s, than ever I pur&s;ued any thing in my Life: But with too great a Dependence on my own Strength; which afterwards proved a great Damage to me. My Experience had not then taught me, as it has
<PB N="29" REF="009961_0037_0F7B3F2600458CB0">
done &s;ince, my extream Feeblene&s;s and Impotence, every manner of Way; and the innumerable and bottomle&s;s Depths of &s;ecret Corruption and Deceit, that there was in my Heart. However, I went on with my eager pur&s;uit after more Holine&s;s; and &s;weet conformity to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>"THE Heaven I de&s;ired was a Heaven of Holine&s;s; to be with GOD, and to &s;pend my Eternity in divine Love, and holy Communion with Chri&s;t. My Mind was very much taken up with Contemplations on Heaven, and the En|joyments of tho&s;e there; and living there in perfect Holine&s;s, Humility and Love. And it u&s;ed at that Time to appear a great Part of the Happine&s;s of Heaven, that there the Saints could expre&s;s their Love to Chri&s;t. It appear'd to me a great Clog and Hindrance and Burden to me, that what I felt within, I could not expre&s;s to GOD, and give vent to, as I de&s;ired. The inward ardor of my Soul, &s;eem'd to be hinder'd and pent up, and could not freely flame out as it would. I u&s;ed often to think, how in Heaven, this &s;weet Principle &s;hould freely and fully vent and expre&s;s it &s;elf. Heaven appeared to me exceeding delightful as a World of Love. It appear'd to me, that all Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in living in pure, humble, heavenly, divine Love.</P>
<P>"I remember the Thoughts I u&s;ed then to have of Ho|line&s;s. I remember I then &s;aid &s;ometimes to my &s;elf, I do certainly know that I love Holine&s;s, &s;uch as the Go&s;pel pre&s;cribes. It appeared to me, there was nothing in it but what was ravi&s;hingly lovely. It appeared to me, to be the highe&s;t Beauty and Amiablene&s;s, above all other Beauties: that it was a <HI>divine</HI> Beauty; far purer than any thing here upon Earth; and that every thing el&s;e, was like Mire, Filth and Defilement, in Compari&s;on of it.</P>
<P>"HOLINESS, as I then wrote down &s;ome of my Con|templations on it, appeared to me to be of a &s;weet, plea&s;ant, charming, &s;erene, calm Nature. It &s;eem'd to me, it brought an inexpre&s;&s;ile Purity, Brightne&s;s, Peacefulne&s;s &amp; Ravi&s;hment to the Soul: and that it made the Soul like a Field or Garden of GOD, with all manner of plea&s;ant Flowers; that is all plea&s;ant, delightful &amp; undi&s;turbed; enjoying a &s;weet Calm, and the gently vivifying Beams of the Sun. The Soul of a true Chri&s;tian, as I then wrote my Meditations, appear'd like &s;uch a little white Flower, as we &s;ee in the Spring of the Year;
<PB N="30" REF="009961_0038_0F7B3F279B5D9D80">
low and humble on the Ground, opening it's Bo&s;om, to re|ceive the plea&s;ant Beams of the Sun's Glory; rejoycing as it were, in a calm Rapture; diffu&s;ing around a &s;weet Fra|grancy; &s;tanding peacefully and lovingly, in the mid&s;t of other Flowers round about; all in like Manner opening their Bo&s;oms, to drink in the Light of the Sun.</P>
<P>"THERE was no Part of Creature-Holine&s;s, that I then, and at other Times, had &s;o great a Sen&s;e of the Loveline&s;s of, as Humility, Brokenne&s;s of Heart and Poverty of Spi|rit: and there was nothing that I had &s;uch a Spirit to long for. My Heart as it were panted after this, to lie low be|fore GOD, and in the Du&s;t; that I might be nothing, and that GOD might be all; that I might become as a little Child.</P>
<P>"WHILE I was there at <HI>New-York,</HI> I &s;ometimes was much affected with Reflections on my pa&s;t Life, con&s;ider|ing how late it was, before I began to be truly religious; and how wickedly I had lived till then: and once &s;o as to weep abundantly, and for a con&s;iderable time together.</P>
<P>"ON <HI>January</HI> 12. 1722, 3. I made a &s;olemn Dedication of my &s;elf to GOD, and wrote it down; giving up my &s;elf, and all that I had to GOD; to be for the future in no Re&s;pect my own; to act as one that had no right to him|&s;elf, in any Re&s;pect. And &s;olemnly vowed to take GOD for my whole Portion and Felicity; looking on nothing el&s;e as any Part of my Happine&s;s, nor acting as if it were: and his Law for the con&s;tant Rule of my Obedience: en|gaging to fight with all my Might, again&s;t the World, the Fle&s;h and the Devil, to the End of my Life. But have Rea&s;on to be infinitely humbled, when I con&s;ider, how much I have fail'd of an&s;wering my Obligation.</P>
<P>"I had then abundance of &s;weet religious Conver&s;ation in the Family where I lived, with Mr. <HI>John Smith,</HI> and his pious Mother. My Heart was knit in Affection to tho&s;e, in whom were Appearances of true Piety; and I could bear the Thoughts of no other Companions, but &s;uch as were holy, and the Di&s;ciples of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="009961_0039_0F7B3F284C9B6EA8">"I had great Longings for the Advancement of Chri&s;t's Kingdom in the World. My &s;ecret Prayer u&s;ed to be in great Part taken up in praying for it. If I heard the lea&s;t hint of any thing that happened in any Part of the World, that appear'd to me, in &s;ome Re&s;pect or other, to have a favourable A&s;pect on the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, my Soul eagerly catch'd at it; and it would much animate and refre&s;h me. I u&s;ed to be earne&s;t to read publick News-Letters, mainly for that End; to &s;ee if I could not find &s;ome News favourable to the Intere&s;t of Religion in the World.</P>
<P>"I very frequently u&s;ed to retire into a &s;olitary Place, on the Banks of <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> River, at &s;ome Di&s;tance from the City, for Contemplation on Divine Things, and &s;ecret Conver&s;e with GOD; and had many &s;weet Hours there. Sometimes Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> and I walked there together, to conver&s;e of the Things of GOD; and our Conver&s;a|tion u&s;ed much to turn on the Advancement of Chri&s;t's Kingdom in the World, and the glorious Things that GOD would accompli&s;h for his Church in the latter Days.</P>
<P>"I had then, and at other Times, the greate&s;t Delight in the holy Scriptures, of any Book what&s;oever. Often|times in reading it, every Word &s;eemed to touch my Heart. I felt an Harmony between &s;omething in my Heart, and tho&s;e &s;weet and powerful Words. I &s;eem'd often to &s;ee &s;o much Light, exhibited by every Sentence, and &s;uch a refre&s;hing ravi&s;hing Food communicated, that I could not get along in reading. U&s;ed often-times to dwell long on one Sentence, to &s;ee the Wonders contained in it; and yet almo&s;t every Sentence &s;eemed to be full of Wonders.</P>
<P>"I came away from <HI>New-York</HI> in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> 1723, and had a mo&s;t bitter parting with Madam <HI>Smith</HI> and her Son. My Heart &s;eemed to &s;ink within me, at leav|ing the Family and City, where I had enjoyed &s;o many &s;weet and plea&s;ant Days. I went from <HI>New-York</HI> to <HI>Wea|thersfield</HI> by Water. As I &s;ail'd away, I kept Sight of the City as long as I could; and when I was out of Sight of it, it would affect me much to look that Way, with a kind of Melancholly mixed with Sweetne&s;s. However, that Night after this &s;orrowful parting, I was greatly com|forted in GOD at <HI>We&s;tche&s;ter,</HI> where we went a&s;hore to
<PB N="32" REF="009961_0040_0F7B3F28F85EBD88">
lodge: and had a plea&s;ant Time of it all the Voyage to <HI>Saybrook.</HI> It was &s;weet to me to think of meeting dear Chri&s;tians in Heaven, where we &s;hould never part more. At <HI>Saybrook</HI> we went a&s;hore to lodge on Saturday, and there kept Sabbath; where I had a &s;weet and refre&s;hing Sea&s;on, walking alone in the Fields.</P>
<P>"AFTER I came home to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> remained much in a like Frame of my Mind, as I had been in at <HI>New-York;</HI> but only &s;ome times felt my Heart ready to &s;ink, with the Thoughts of my Friends at <HI>New York.</HI> And my Refuge and Support was in Contemplations on the heavenly State; as I find in my Diary of <HI>May</HI> 1. 1723. It was my Com|fort to think of that State, where there is fulne&s;s of Joy; where reigns heavenly, &s;weet, calm and delightful Love, without Alloy; where there are continually the deare&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of this Love; where is the Enjoyment of the Per&s;ons loved, without ever parting; where the&s;e Per&s;ons that appear &s;o lovely in this World, will really be inex|pre&s;&s;ibly more lovely, and full of love to us. And how &s;weetly will the mutual Lovers join together to &s;ing the Prai&s;es of GOD and the LAMB! How full will it fill us with Joy, to think, that this Enjoyment, the&s;e &s;weet Exer|ci&s;es will never cea&s;e or come to an End; but will la&s;t to all Eternity!</P>
<P>"CONTINUED much in the &s;ame Frame in the general, that I had been in at <HI>New-York,</HI> till I went to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> to live there as Tutor of the College; having one &s;pecial Sea&s;on of uncommon Swe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tne&s;s: particularly once at <HI>Bolton,</HI> in a Journey from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> walking out alone in the Fields. After I went to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> I &s;unk in Religion; my Mind being diverted from my eager and violent Pur&s;uits after Holine&s;s, by &s;ome Affairs that greatly perplexed and di&s;tract|ed my Mind.</P>

And in this Sickne&s;s, GOD was plea&s;ed to vi&s;it me again with the &s;weet Influ|ences of his Spirit. My Mind was greatly engaged there on divine, plea&s;ant Contemplations, and Longings of Soul.

I ob&s;erved that tho&s;e who watched with me, would often be looking out for the Morning, and &s;eemed to wi&s;h for it. Which brought to my Mind tho&s;e Words of the P&s;almi&s;t, which my Soul with Sweetne&s;s made it's own Language. <HI>My Soul waiteth for the Lord, more than they that watch for the Morning, I &s;ay, more than they that watch for the Morning.</HI> And when the Light of the Morning came, and the Beams of the Sun came in at the Windows, it refre&s;hed my Soul from one Morning to another. It &s;eemed to me to be &s;ome I|mage of the &s;weet Light of GOD's Glory.</P>
<P>"I remember, about that Time, I u&s;ed greatly to long for the Conver&s;ion of &s;ome that I was concerned with. It &s;eem'd to me, I could gladly honor them, and with Delight be a Servant to them, and lie at their Feet, if they were but truly holy.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ome Time after this, I was again greatly diverted in my Mind, with &s;ome temporal Concerns, that exceed|ingly took up my Thoughts, greatly to the wounding of my Soul: and went on through various Exerci&s;es, that it would be tedious to relate, that gave me much more Expe|rience of my own Heart, than ever I had before.</P>
<P>"SINCE I came to this Town, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Northampton.</NOTE> I have often had &s;weet Complacency in GOD, in Views of his glorious Perfections, and the Excellency of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. GOD has appeared to me, a glorious and lovely Being, chiefly on the account of his Holine&s;s. The Holine&s;s of GOD has always appeared to me the mo&s;t lovely of all his Attributes. The Doctrines of God's ab&s;olute Sovereignty, and free Grace, in &s;hewing Mercy to whom he would &s;hew Mercy; and Man's ab&s;o|lute Dependance on the Operations of God's Holy Spirit, have very often appeared to me as &s;weet and glorious Doct|rines. The&s;e Doctrines have been much my Delight. GOD's Sovereignty has ever appeared to me, as great Part of his Glory. It has often been &s;weet to me to go to GOD, and adore Him as a &s;overeign GOD, and a&s;k &s;o|vereign Mercy of Him.</P>
<P>"I have loved the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel: They have been to my Soul like green Pa&s;tures. The Go&s;pel has &s;eem'd to me to be the riche&s;t Trea&s;ure; the Trea&s;ure

that I have mo&s;t de&s;ired, and longed that it might dwell richly in me. The Way of Salvation by Chri&s;t, has ap|peared in a general Way, glorious and excellent, and mo&s;t plea&s;ant and beautiful. It has often &s;eem'd to me, that it would in a great Mea&s;ure &s;poil Heaven, to receive it in any other Way. That Text has often been affecting and de|lightful to me, I&s;ai. xxxii. 2. <HI>A Man &s;hall be an hiding Place from the Wind, and a Covert from the Tempe&s;t &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>"IT has often appear'd &s;weet to me, to be united to CHRIST; to have Him for my Head, and to be a Member of his Body: and al&s;o to have CHRIST for my Teacher and Prophet. I very often think with Sweetne&s;s and Long|ings and Pantings of Soul, of being a little Child, taking hold of CHRIST, to be led by Him through the Wilder|ne&s;s of this World. That Text, <HI>Matth.</HI> xviii. at the Be|ginning, has often been &s;weet to me, <HI>Except ye be converted, and become as little Children &amp;c.</HI> I love to think of coming to CHRIST, to receive Salvation of him, poor in Spirit, and quite empty of Self; humbly exalting Him alone; cut entirely off from my own Root, and to grow into, and out of CHRIST: to have GOD in CHRIST to be all in all; and to live by Faith on the Son of GOD, a Life of humble, un|feigned Confidence in Him. That Scripture has often been &s;weet to me, P&s;al. cxv. 1. <HI>Not unto us, O LOR<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, not unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory, for thy Mercy, and for thy Truth's &s;ake.</HI> And tho&s;e Words of Chri&s;t, <HI>Luk.</HI> x. 21. <HI>In that Hour Je&s;us rejoyced in Spirit, and &s;aid, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e Things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto Babes: Even &s;o Father, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy Sight.</HI> That Sovereignty of GOD that Chri&s;t rejoyced in, &s;eem|ed to me to be worthy to be rejoyced in; and that rejoyc|ing of CHRIST, &s;eemed to me to &s;hew the Excellency of CHRIST, and the Spirit that he was of.</P>
<P>"SOMETIMES only mentioning a &s;ingle Word, cau&s;es my Heart to burn within me: or only &s;eeing the Name of CHRIST, or the Name of &s;ome Attribute of GOD. And GOD has appeared glorious to me, on account of the TRINITY. It has made me have exalting Thoughts of GOD, that he &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in three Per&s;ons; FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST.</P>

When I enjoy this Sweetne&s;s, it &s;eems to carry me above the Thoughts of my own &s;afe E&s;tate. It &s;eems at &s;uch Times a Lo&s;s that I cannot bear, to take off my Eye from the glorious, plea&s;ant Object I behold with|out me, to turn my Eye in upon my &s;elf, and my own good E&s;tate.</P>
<P>"My Heart has been much on the Advancement of Chri&s;t's Kingdom in the World. The Hi&s;tories of the pa&s;t Advancement of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, have been &s;weet to me. When I have read Hi&s;tories of pa&s;t Ages, the plea&s;ante&s;t Thing in all my reading has been, to read of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t being promoted. And when I hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> expected in my reading, to come to any &s;uch thing, I have lotted upon it all the Way as I read. And my Mind has been much entertained and delighted, with the Scripture Promi&s;es and Prophecies, of the future glorious Advance|ment of Chri&s;t's Kingdom on Earth.</P>
<P>"I have &s;ometimes had a Sen&s;e of the excellent Fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and his Meetne&s;s and Suitablene&s;s as a Saviour; whereby he has appeared to me, far above all, the chief of ten Thou&s;ands. And his Blood and Atonement has ap|peared &s;weet, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;weet; which is al|ways accompanied with an Ardency of Spirit, and inward Strugglings and Breathings and Groanings, that cannot be uttered, to be emptied of my &s;elf, and &s;wallowed up in CHRIST.</P>
<P>"ONCE, as I rid out into the Woods for my Health, <HI>Anno</HI> 1737; and having lit from my Hor&s;e in a retired Place, as my Manner commonly has been, to walk for divine Contemplation and Prayer; I had a View, that for me was extraordinary, of the Glory of the SON OF GOD; as Mediator between GOD and Man; and his wonderful, great, full, pure and &s;weet Grace and Love, and meek and gentle Conde&s;cention. This Grace, that appear'd to me &s;o calm and &s;weet, appear'd great above the Heavens. The Per&s;on of CHRIST appear'd ineffably excellent, with an Excellency great enough to &s;wallow up all Thought and Conception. Which continued, as near as I can judge,
<PB N="36" REF="009961_0044_0F7B3F2D25ECA610">
about an Hour; which kept me, the bigger Part of the Time, in a Flood of Tears, and weeping aloud. I felt withal, an Ardency of Soul to be, what I know not other|wi&s;e how to expre&s;s, than to be emptied and annihilated; to lie in the Du&s;t, and to be full of Chri&s;t alone; to love him with a holy and pure Love; to tru&s;t in him; to live upon him; to &s;erve and follow him, and to be totally wrapt up in the Fullne&s;s of Chri&s;t; and to be perfectly &s;anctified and made pure, with a divine and heavenly Purity. I have &s;everal other Times, had Views very much of the &s;ame Nature, and that have had the &s;ame Effects.</P>
<P>"I have many Times had a Sen&s;e of the Glory of the third Per&s;on in the Trinity, in his Office of Sanctifier; in his holy Operations communicating divine Light and Life to the Soul. GOD in the Communications of his Holy Spirit, has appear'd as an infinite Fountain of Divine Glory and Sweetne&s;s; being full and &s;ufficient to fill and &s;atisfy the Soul: pouring forth it &s;elf in &s;weet Communications, like the Sun in its Glory, &s;weetly and plea&s;antly diffu&s;ing Light and Life.</P>
<P>"I have &s;ometimes had an affecting Sen&s;e of the Ex|cellency of the Word of GOD, as a Word of Life; as the Light of Life; a &s;weet, excellent, Life giving Word: accompanied with a thir&s;ting after that Word, that it might dwell richly in my Heart.</P>
<P>"I have often &s;ince I lived in this Town, had very affecting Views of my own Sinfulne&s;s and Vilene&s;s; very frequently &s;o as to hold me in a kind of loud Weeping, &s;ometimes for a con&s;iderable time together: &s;o that I have often been forced to &s;hut my &s;elf up. I have had a va&s;tly greater Sen&s;e of my own Wickedne&s;s, and the Badne&s;s of my Heart, &s;ince my Conver&s;ion, than ever I had before. It has often appeared to me, that if GOD &s;hould mark Ini|quity again&s;t me, I &s;hould appear the very wor&s;t of all Man|kind; of all that have been &s;ince the beginning of the World to this time: and that I &s;hould have by far the lowe&s;t Place in Hell. When others that have come to talk with me about their Soul Concerns, have expre&s;&s;ed the Sen&s;e they have had of their own Wickedne&s;s, by &s;aying that it &s;eem'd to them, that they were as bad as the

Devil him&s;elf; I thought their Expre&s;&s;ions &s;eemed exceed|ing faint and feeble, to repre&s;ent my Wickedne&s;s. I thought I &s;hould wonder, that they &s;hould content them&s;elves with &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, if I had any Rea&s;on to imagine, that their Sin bore any Proportion to mine. It &s;eemed to me, I &s;hould wonder at my &s;elf, if I &s;hould expre&s;s <HI>my</HI> Wickedne&s;s in &s;uch feeble Terms as they did.</P>
<P>"MY Wickedne&s;s, as I am in my &s;elf, has long ap|pear'd to me perfectly ineffable, and infinitely &s;wallowing up all Thought and Imagination; like an infinite Deluge, or infinite Mountains over my Head. I know not how to expre&s;s better, what my Sins appear to me to be, than by heaping Infinite upon Infinite, and multiplying Infinite by Infinite. I go about very often, for this many Years, with the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions in my Mind, and in My Mouth, "Infinite upon Infinite. Infinite upon Infinite!" When I look into my Heart, and take a view of my Wickedne&s;s, it looks like an Aby&s;s infinitely deeper than Hell. And it appears to me, that were it not for free Grace, exalted and rai&s;ed up to the infinite Height of all the fulne&s;s and glory of the great JEHOVAH, and the Arm of his Power and Grace &s;tretched forth, in all the Maje&s;ty of his Power, and in all the Glory of his Sovereignty; I &s;hould appear &s;unk down in my Sins infinitely below Hell it &s;elf, far beyond Sight of every Thing, but the piercing Eye of God's Grace, that can pierce even down to &s;uch a Depth, and to the bottom of &s;uch an Aby&s;s.</P>
<P>"AND yet, I ben't in the lea&s;t inclined to think, that I have a greater Conviction of Sin than ordinary. It &s;eems to me, my Conviction of Sin is exceeding &s;mall, and faint. It appears to me enough to amaze me, that I have no more Sen&s;e of my Sin. I know certainly, that I have very lit|tle Sen&s;e of my &s;infulne&s;s. That my Sins appear to me &s;o great, don't &s;eem to me to be, becau&s;e I have &s;o much more Conviction of Sin than other Chri&s;tians, but becau&s;e I am &s;o much wor&s;e, and have &s;o much more Wickedne&s;s to be convinced of. When I have had the&s;e Turns of weeping and crying for my Sins, I thought I knew in the Time of it, that my Repentance was nothing to my Sin.</P>
<P>"I have greatly longed of late, for a broken Heart, and to lie low before GOD. And when I a&s;k for Humility of

GOD, I can't bear the Thoughts of being no more hum|ble, than other Chri&s;tians. It &s;eems to me, that tho' their Degrees of Humility may be &s;uitable for them; yet it would be a vile Self-exaltation in me, not to be the lowe&s;t in Humility of all Mankind. Others &s;peak of their long|ing to be humbled to the Du&s;t. Tho' that may be a pro|per Expre&s;&s;ion for them, I always think for my &s;elf, that I ought to be humbled down below Hell. 'Tis an Ex|pre&s;&s;ion that it has long been natural for me to u&s;e in Prayer to God. I ought to lie infinitely low before GOD.</P>
<P>"IT is affecting to me to think, how ignorant I was, when I was a young Chri&s;tian, of the bottomle&s;s, infinite Depths of Wickedne&s;s, Pride, Hppocri&s;y and Deceit left in my Heart.</P>
<P>I Have va&s;tly a greater Sen&s;e, of my univer&s;al, exceed|ing Dependence on God's Grace and Strength, and meer good Plea&s;ure, of late, than I u&s;ed formerly to have; and have experienced more of an Abhorrence of my own Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. The Thought of any Comfort or Joy, ari&s;ing in me, on any Con&s;ideration, or Reflection on my own A|miablene&s;s, or any of my Performances or Experiences, or any Goodne&s;s of Heart or Life, is nau&s;eous and dete&s;table to me.

I &s;ee that Serpent ri&s;ing and putting forth it's Head, continually, every where, all around me.</P>
<P>"THO' it &s;eems to me, that in &s;ome Re&s;pects I was a far better Chri&s;tian, for two or three Years after my fir&s;t Conver&s;ion, than I am now; and lived in a more con&s;tant Delight and Plea&s;ure: yet of late Years, I have had a more full and con&s;tant Sen&s;e of the ab&s;olute Sovereignty of GOD, and a delight in that Sovereignty; and have had more of a Sen&s;e of the Glory of CHRIST, as a Mediator, as revealed in the Go&s;pel.

<HEAD>SECTION I. His GENERAL MANNER of LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>MR. EDWARDS made a Secret of his private Devo|tion, and therefore it cannot be particularly known: tho' there is much Evidence, that he was punctual, con&s;tant and frequent in &s;ecret Prayer, and often kept Days of Fa&s;ting and Prayer in &s;ecret; and &s;et a part Time for &s;erious, devout Meditations on &s;piritual and eternal things, as part of his religious Exerci&s;e in &s;ecret. It appears by his Diary that in his Youth he determined to attend &s;ecret Prayer more than twice a Day, when Circum&s;tances would allow. He was, &s;o far as it can be known, much on his Knees in &s;ecret, and in devout reading God's Word, &amp; Meditation upon it. And his con&s;tant, &s;olemn conver&s;e with GOD in the&s;e Exerci&s;es of &s;ecret Religion made his Face, as it were, to &s;hine before others. His Appearance, his Countenance, Words and whole Demeanour, (tho' without any thing of

affected Grimace and &s;our Au&s;terity) w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s attended with a Seriou&s;ne&s;s, Gravity and Solemnity, which was the na|tural genuine Indications and Expre&s;&s;ion of a deep, abiding Sen&s;e of divine Things on his Mind, and of his living con&s;tantly in the fear of God.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to his Re&s;olutions, he was very careful and ab&s;temious in eating and drinking; as doubtle&s;s it was nece&s;&s;ary &s;o great a Student, and a Per&s;on of &s;o delicate and tender a bodily make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he was, &s;hould be, in order to be comfortable and u&s;eful. When he had, by careful Ob&s;er|vation, found what kind, and what quantity of Diet, be&s;t &s;uited his Con&s;titution, and render'd him mo&s;t fit to pur&s;ue his Work, he was very &s;trict and exact in complying with it; and in this re&s;pect <HI>lived by Rule;</HI> and herein con&s;tantly practi&s;ed great Self-denial: Which he al&s;o did in his con|&s;tant early ri&s;ing, in order to redeem Time for his Study. He u&s;ed him&s;elf to ri&s;e by four or between four and five in the Morning.</P>
<P>THO' he was of a tender and delicate Con&s;titution, yet few Students are capable of clo&s;e Application more Hours in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Day than he. He commonly &s;pent thirteen Hours every Day in his Study. His mo&s;t u&s;ual Diver&s;ion in the Summer was riding on Hor&s;eback and walking. He would commonly, unle&s;s diverted by Company, ride two or three Miles after Dinner to &s;ome lonely Grove, where he would di&s;mount and walk a while. At which times he generally carried his Pen and Ink with him, to note any Thought that &s;hould be &s;ugge&s;ted, which he cho&s;e to retain and pur|&s;ue, as what promi&s;ed &s;ome Light on any important Subject. In the Winter he was wont almo&s;t daily to take an Ax and chop Wood moderately for the &s;pace of half an Hour or more.</P>
<P>HE had an uncommon thir&s;t for Knowledge, in the pur|&s;uit of which, he &s;pared no Co&s;t nor Pains. He read all the Books, e&s;pecially Books of Divinity, that he could come at, from which he could hope to get any help in his pur&s;uit of Knowledge. And in this, he confin'd not him&s;elf to Au|thors of any particular Sect or Denomination; yea took much pains to come at the Books of the mo&s;t noted Wri|ters, who advance a Scheme of Divinity mo&s;t contrary to his own Principles. But he &s;tudied the BIBLE more than all other Books, and more than mo&s;t other Divines do. His uncommon acquaintance with the Bible appears in his Ser|mons, and in mo&s;t of his Publications: and his great pains in
<PB N="41" REF="009961_0049_0F7B3F3082705420">
&s;tudying it are manife&s;t in his Manu&s;cript Notes upon it; of which a more particular Account may be given here|after. He took his religious Principles from the Bible, and not from any human Sy&s;tem or Body of Divinity. Tho' his Principles were <HI>Calvini&s;tic,</HI> yet he called no Man, Father. He thought and judged for him&s;elf, and was truly very much of an Original. This is evident by what he pub|li&s;hed in his Life-time, and is yet more &s;o by his MSS. Many Volumes of which he has left; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd the Reader may expect a more particular Account of them in the Sequel. For reading was not the only Method he took to improve his Mind; but he did this much by Writing; without which, 'tis probable no Student can make Improvements to the be&s;t Advantage. Agreable to Re&s;olution 11th, he applied him&s;elf with all his Might to find out the Truth: He &s;earched for Under&s;tanding and Knowledge, as for Sil|ver, and digged for it, as for hid Trea&s;ures. Every thought on any Subject, which appear'd to him worth pur&s;uing and pre&s;erving, he pur&s;ued, as far as he then could, with his Pen in his Hand. Thus he was all his Days, like the bu&s;y Bee, collecting from every opening Flower, and &s;toring up a Stock of Knowledge, which was indeed &s;weet to him, as the Honey &amp; the Honey-comb. And as he advanced in Years and in Knowledge, his Pen was more and more employed, and his Manu&s;cripts grew much fa&s;ter on his Hands.</P>
<P>HE was thought by &s;ome, who had but a &s;light Ac|quaintance with him to be &s;tiff &amp; un&s;ociable; but this was owing to want of better Acquaintance. He was not a Man of many Words indeed, and was &s;omewhat re&s;erved among Strangers, and tho&s;e on who&s;e Candor and Friend&s;hip he did not know he could rely. And this was probably owing to two Things. Fir&s;t, the &s;trict Guard he &s;et over his Tongue from his Youth, which appears by his Re&s;olutions, taking great Care never to u&s;e it in any way that might prove mi&s;chievous to any; never to <HI>&s;in with his Tongue;</HI> or to improve it in idle, trivial and impertinent Talk, which generally makes up a great Part of the Conver&s;ation of tho&s;e who are full of Words in all Companies. He was &s;en&s;ible that in the multitude of Words there wanteth not Sin; and therefore refrained his Lips, and habituated him&s;elf to <HI>think</HI> before he <HI>&s;poke,</HI> and to propo&s;e &s;ome good End even in all his Words; which led him to be above many others, ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eable to St. James's Advice, <HI>&s;low to &s;peak.</HI> Secondly,
<PB N="42" REF="009961_0050_0F7B3F31403FD7C0">
this was in Part the effect of his bodily Con&s;titution. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but a comparative &s;mall Stock of animal Life: his animal Spirits were low, and he had not Strength of Lungs to &s;pare, that would be nece&s;&s;ary in order to make him what would be called, an affable, facecious Gentleman, in all Companies. They who have a great flow of animal Spirits, and &s;o can &s;peak with more Ea&s;e and le&s;s Expence, may doubtle&s;s lawfully practice free Conver&s;ation in all Companies for a lower End, (e. g. to plea&s;e and render them&s;elves acceptable) than he, who has not &s;uch a Stock to expend upon. It becomes <HI>him</HI> to re&s;erve what he has, for higher and more important Service. Be&s;ides, the want of animal Spirits lays a Man under a <HI>natural</HI> inability to that freedom of Conver&s;ation, at all times, and in what|ever Company he is; which tho&s;e of more Life naturally go into; and the greate&s;t Degree of a &s;ociable Di&s;po&s;ition, Humility and Benevolence, will not remove this Ob&s;tacle.</P>
<P>HE was not forward to enter into any Di&s;pute among Strangers, and in Companies where were Per&s;ons of diffe|rent Sentiments; as he was &s;en&s;ible that &s;uch Di&s;putes are generally unprofitable, and often &s;inful and of bad Con&s;e|quence; and he tho't he could di&s;pute to the be&s;t Advan|tage with his Pen in his Hand: Yet he was always free to give his Sentiments on any Subject propo&s;ed to him; and re|move any Difficulties or Objections offered by way of Enqui|ry, as lying in the Way of what he looked upon to be the Truth. But how groundle&s;s the imputation of <HI>&s;tiff</HI> and <HI>un&s;ociable</HI> was, his known and tried Friends be&s;t knew. They always found him ea&s;y of acce&s;s, kind and conde|&s;cending; and tho' not talkative, yet affable and free. Among &s;uch who&s;e Candor and Friend&s;hip he had experi|enced, he threw off the Re&s;erve, and was mo&s;t open and free; quite patient of Contradiction, while the utmo&s;t Op|po&s;ition was made to his Sentiments, that could be by any plau&s;ible Arguments or Objections. And indeed, he was on all Occa&s;ions, quite &s;ociable and free with all, who had any &s;pecial Bu&s;ine&s;s with him.</P>
<P>IN his Conduct in his Family he practi&s;ed that con&s;ci|entious exactne&s;s which was per&s;picuous in all his Ways. He maintained a great e&s;teem and regard for his amiable and excellent Con&s;ort. Much of the tender and kind was expre&s;&s;ed in his Conver&s;ation with her and conduct to|wards

her. He was won't frequently to admit her into his Study, and conver&s;e freely with her on Matters of Religion. And he u&s;ed commonly to pray with her in his Study, at lea&s;t once a Day, unle&s;s &s;omething extraordinary prevented. The time in which this u&s;ed to be commonly attended, was ju&s;t before going to Bed, after Prayers in the Family. As he ro&s;e very early him&s;elf, he was wont to have his Family up in &s;ea&s;on in the Morning; after which, before the Family entered on the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day, he attended on Family Prayers. When a Chapter in the Bible was read, commonly by Candle-light in the Winter; upon which he a&s;ked his Children Que&s;tions according to their Age and Capacity; and took Occa&s;ion to explain &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in it, or enforce any Duty recomended &amp;c. as he thought mo&s;t proper.</P>
<P>HE was careful and thorough in the Government of his Children; and, as a Con&s;equence of this, they reverenced, e&s;teemed and loved him. He took &s;pecial care to begin his Government of them in Sea&s;on. When they fir&s;t di&s;co|vered any con&s;iderable degree of Will and Stubbornne&s;s, he would attend to them till he had thoroughly &s;ubdued them and brought them to &s;ubmit. And &s;uch prudent thorow Di&s;cipline, exerci&s;ed with the greate&s;t Calmne&s;s, and com|monly without &s;triking a Blow, being repeated once or twice, was generally &s;ufficient for that Child; and ef|fectually e&s;tabli&s;hed his parental Authority, and produced a chearful Obedience ever after.</P>
<P>HE kept a watchful Eye over his Children, that he might admoni&s;h them of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> wrong Step, and direct them in the right Way. He took Opportunities to treat with them in his Study, &s;ingly and particularly about their own Soul's Concerns; and to give them Warning, Exhortation and Direction, as he &s;aw Occa&s;ion. He took much Pains to in&s;truct them in the Principles of Religion; in which he made u&s;e of the <HI>A&s;&s;embly's Shorter Catechi&s;m:</HI> not meerly by taking care that they learned it by Heart; but by lead|ing them into an under&s;tanding of the Doctrines therein taught, by a&s;king them Que&s;tions on each An&s;wer, and explaining it to them. His u&s;ual time to attend this was on the Evening before the Sabbath. And as he believed that the Sabbath or holy Time bgan at Sun-&s;et the Even|ing before the Day, he order'd his Family to fini&s;h all their
<PB N="44" REF="009961_0052_0F7B3F340CB50570">
&s;ecular Bu&s;ine&s;s by that time or before; when they were all called together, and a P&s;alm was &s;ung and Prayer at|tended, as an Introduction to the &s;anctifying the Sabbath. This care and exactne&s;s effectually prevented that intruding on holy Time, by attending on &s;ecular Bu&s;ine&s;s, too com|mon in Families where the Evening before the Sabbath is pretended to be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>HE was a great Enemy to young People's un&s;ea&s;onable Company-keeping and Frolicking, as he look'd upon it a great Means of corrupting and ruining Youth. And he thought the Excu&s;e many Parents make for tolerating their Children in it, (viz. that it is the Cu&s;tom, and others Chil|dren practi&s;e it, which renders it difficult, and even impo&s;|&s;ible to re&s;train theirs) was in&s;ufficient and frivolous: and manife&s;ted a great Degree of Stupidity, on &s;uppo&s;ition the practice was hurtful and pernicious to their Souls. And when &s;ome of his Children grew up he found no difficulty in re&s;training them from this pernicious Practice; but they chearfully complied with the will of their Parents herein. He allowed not his Children to be from home after nine o'Clock at Night, when they went abroad to &s;ee their Friends and Companions. Neither were they allowed to &s;it up much after that Time, in his own Hou&s;e, when any came to make them a vi&s;it. If any Gentleman de&s;ired Acquaintance with his Daughters; after hand&s;omely intro|ducing him&s;elf, by properly con&s;ulting the Parents, he was allowed all proper Opportunity for it; a Room and Fire, if needed: but mu&s;t not intrude on the proper Hours of Re&s;t and Sleep, or the Religion and Order of the Family.</P>
<P>HE had a &s;trict and inviolable regard to Ju&s;tice in all his dealings with his Neighbours, and was very careful to provide for Things hone&s;t in the &s;ight of all Men; &s;o that &s;carcely a Man had any Dealings with him, that was not con&s;cious of his uprightne&s;s. He appeared to have a &s;acred regard to truth in his Words, both in Promi&s;es and Narra|tions, agreeable to his Re&s;olutions. This doubtle&s;s was one Rea&s;on why he was not &s;o full of Words as many are. No Man feared to rely on his Veracity.</P>
<P>HE was cautious in chu&s;ing his <HI>intimate Friends,</HI> and there|fore had not many that might properly be called &s;uch. But to them he &s;hewed him&s;elf friendly in a peculiar manner.
<PB N="45" REF="009961_0053_0F7B3F34E0462D30">
He was indeed a faithful Friend, and able above mo&s;t o|thers to keep a Secret. To them he di&s;cover'd him&s;elf more than to others, led them into his Views and Ends in his Conduct in particular In&s;tances: by which they had abundant Evidence that he well under&s;tood human Nature; and that his general Re&s;ervedne&s;s, and many particular In&s;tances of his Conduct, which a Stranger might impute to ignorance of Men, were really owing to his uncommon Knowledge of Mankind.</P>
<P>HIS Conver&s;ation with his Friends was always &s;avory and profitable: In this he was remarkable, and almo&s;t &s;ingular.&mdash;He was not wont to &s;pend his time with them, in Scandal, Evil-&s;peaking and Back-biting, or in fooli&s;h Je&s;ting, idle chat, and telling Stories: But his Mouth was that of the Ju&s;t, which bringeth forth Wi&s;dom, and his Lips di&s;per&s;ed Knowledge. His Tongue was as the Pen of a ready Writer, while he conver&s;ed about important, heavenly, divine Things, which his Heart was &s;o full of, in &s;uch a natural and free manner, as to be mo&s;t enter|taining and in&s;tructive: &s;o that none of his Friends could enjoy his Company without In&s;truction and Profit, unle&s;s it was by their own fault.</P>
<P>HIS great Benevolence to Mankind di&s;covered it &s;elf, among other ways, by the uncommon regard he &s;hewed to Liberality, and Charity to the Poor and Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. He was much in recommend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng this, both in his publick Di&s;|cour&s;es and private Conver&s;ation. He often declared it to be his Opinion, that profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, in the&s;e Days are greatly deficient in this Duty; and much more &s;o, than in mo&s;t other Parts of external Chri&s;tianity. He often ob|&s;erved how much this is &s;poken of, recommended and en|couraged in the holy Scripture, e&s;pecially in the New-Te&s;tament. And it was his Opinion, that every particu|lar Church ought by frequent and liberal Contributions, to maintain a publick Stock, that might be ready for the poor and nece&s;&s;itous Members of that Church: and that the principal Bu&s;ine&s;s of Deacons is to take care of the Poor in the faithful and judicious Di&s;tribution and Improvement of the Church's temporals, lodged in their Hands. And he did not content him&s;elf with only re|commending Charity to others, but practis'd it much him|&s;elf: Tho', according to his Ma&s;ter's Advice, he took
<PB N="46" REF="009961_0054_0F7B3F35063D0BC0">
great Care to conceal his Deeds of Charity; by which Means doubtle&s;s mo&s;t of his Alms-deeds will be unknown till the Re&s;urrection, which if known, would prove him to be as great an In&s;tance of Charity as any that can be produced in this Age. This is not meer Conjecture, but is evident many ways. He was forward to give on all publick Occa|&s;ions of Charity, tho' when it could properly be done, he always conceal'd the Sum given. And &s;ome In&s;tances of his giving more privately have accidentally come to the Knowlede of others, in which his Liberality appeared in a very extraordinary Degree. One of the In&s;tances was this. Upon hearing that a poor ob&s;cure Man, whom he never &s;aw, or any of his kindred, was by an extraordinary bodily Di&s;order, brought to great Straits; he, una&s;ked, gave <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A con&s;iderable Sum.</NOTE> to a Friend to be delivered to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Per&s;on; having fir&s;t required a Promi&s;e of him, that he would let neither the Per&s;on, who was the Object of his Charity, nor any one el&s;e know by whom it was given. This may &s;erve both as an In&s;tance of his extra|ordinary Charity, and of his great Care to conceal it. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As both the giver, and the Object of his Charity are dead, and all the Ends of the propo&s;ed &s;ecrecy are an&s;wered; 'tis thought not incon&s;i&s;tent with the above mentioned Promi&s;e, to make known the Fact, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it is here related.</NOTE></P>
<P>Mr. EDWARDS had the mo&s;t univer&s;al Character of a <HI>good Preacher</HI> of almo&s;t any Mini&s;ter in this Age. There were but few that heard him, who did not call him a good Preacher, however they might di&s;like his religious Princi|ples, and be much offended at the &s;ame Truths when delivered by others: And mo&s;t admired him above all that ever they heard. His Eminency as a Preacher &s;eems to be owing to the following Things.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The great Pains he took in compo&s;ing his Ser|mons, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t Part of his Life. As by his early ri&s;ing, and con&s;tant attention to his Study, he had more time than mo&s;t others; &s;o he &s;pent more time in making his Sermons. He wrote mo&s;t of his Sermons all out, for near twenty Years after he fir&s;t began to preach; tho' he did not wholly confine him&s;elf to his Notes in his delivering them.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="009961_0055_0F7B3F35B7ED8140"><HI>Secondly,</HI> His great acquaintance with Divinity, his &s;tudy and knowledge of the Bible. His exten&s;ive and univer&s;al Knowledge, and great clearne&s;s of Thought, enabled him to handle every Subject with great Judgment and Propriety, and to bring out of his Trea&s;ury things new and old. Every Subject he handled was in&s;tructive, plain, entertain|ing and profitable; which was much owing to his being Ma&s;ter of the Subject, and his great &s;kill to treat it in a mo&s;t natural, ea&s;y, and profitable Manner. None of his Com|po&s;ures were dry Speculations, or unmeaning Harangues, or Words without Ideas. When he dwelt on tho&s;e Truths which are much controverted and oppo&s;ed by many, which was often the Ca&s;e, he would &s;et them in &s;uch a natural and ea&s;y Light, and every Sentiment from Step to Step, would drop from his Lips, attended with &s;uch clear and &s;triking Evidence, both from Scripture and Rea&s;on, as even to force the a&s;&s;ent of every attentive Hearer.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> His excellency as a Preacher was very much the Effect of his great Acquaintance with his own Heart, his inward Sen&s;e and high Reli&s;h of divine Truths, and the high Exerci&s;e of true, experimental Religion. This gave him a great in&s;ight into human Nature: He knew what was in Man, both the Saint and the Sinner. This helped him to Skill, to lay Truth before the Mind, &s;o as not only to convince the Judgment, but touch the Heart and Con&s;cience; and enabled him to &s;peak out of the abun|dance of his Heart, what he knew, and te&s;tify what he had &s;een and felt. This gave him a ta&s;te and di&s;cerning, with|out which he could not have been able to fill his Sermons, as he did, with &s;uch &s;triking, affecting Sentiments, all &s;uit|ed to &s;olemnize, move, and rectify the Heart of the Hearer. His Sermons were well connected, not u&s;ually long, and commonly a large Part taken up in the Improvement; which was clo&s;ely connected with the Subject, and con&s;i&s;t|ed in Sentiments naturally flowing from it.</P>
<P>BUT no De&s;cription of his Sermons will give the Rea|der the Idea of them which they have who &s;at under his Preaching, or have even read &s;ome of his Di&s;cour&s;es which are in print. There is a great Number now in Manu|&s;cript, which are probably as worthy the view of the Pub|lick, and at lea&s;t tend as much to in&s;truct and quicken Chri&s;tians, as mo&s;t that have been publi&s;hed in this Cen|tury.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="009961_0056_0F7B3F3686DF71F8">HIS Appearance in the De&s;k was with a good Grace, and his delivery ea&s;y, natural and very &s;olemn. He had not a &s;trong, loud Voice; but appear'd with &s;uch gravity and &s;olemnity, and &s;pake wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h &s;uch di&s;tinctne&s;s, clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion; his Words were &s;o full of Ideas, &s;et in &s;uch a plain and &s;triking Light, that few Speakers have been &s;o able to demand the Attention of an Audience as he. His Words often di&s;cover'd a great degree of inward fervor, without much Noi&s;e or external Emotion, and fell with great weight on the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nds of his Hearers. He made but little Motion of his Head or Hands in the De&s;k, but &s;pake &s;o as to di&s;cover the Motion of his own Heart, which tend|ed in the mo&s;t natural and effectual manner to move and affect others.</P>
<P>AS he wrote his Sermons out at large for many Years, and always wrote a con&s;iderable part of mo&s;t of his pub|lick Di&s;cour&s;es; &s;o he carried his Notes into the De&s;k with him, and read the mo&s;t that he had wrote; yet he was not &s;o confined to his Notes, when he had wrote at large, but that, if &s;ome Thoughts were &s;ugge&s;ted while he was &s;peaking, which did not occur when writing, and appeared to him pertinent and &s;triking, he would deliver them; and that with as great propriety and fluency, and oftner with greater pathos, and attended with a more &s;en&s;ible good effect on his Hearers, than all he had wrote.</P>
<P>THO', as has been ob&s;erved, he was wont to read &s;o con&s;iderable a part of what he delivered; yet he was for from thinking this the be&s;t way of preaching in gene|ral; and look'd upon his u&s;ing his Notes &s;o much as he did, a Deficiency and Infirmity. And in the latter part of his Life was inclined to think it had been better, if he had never accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to u&s;e his Notes at all. It ap|peared to him that preaching wholly without Notes, agre|eable to the Cu&s;tom in mo&s;t Prote&s;tant Countries, and what &s;eems evidently to have been the manner of the Apo&s;tles and primitive Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, was by far the mo&s;t natural way; and had the greate&s;t tendency on the whole, to an&s;wer the End of Preaching: and &s;uppo&s;ed that none who had Talents equal to the Work of the Mini&s;try, was incapable of &s;peaking Memoriter, if he took &s;uitable Pains for this Attainment from his Youth. He would have the young Preacher write all his Sermons, or at lea&s;t mo&s;t of them, out at large; and in&s;tead of reading
<PB N="49" REF="009961_0057_0F7B3F3740D5B308">
them to his Hearers, take pains to commit them to Me|mory. Which, tho' it would require a great deal of La|bour at fir&s;t, yet would &s;oon become ea&s;ier by u&s;e, and help him to &s;peak more correctly and freely, and be of great Service to him all his Days.</P>
<P>HIS Prayers were indeed <HI>extempore.</HI> He was the farthe&s;t from any appearance of a Form, as to his Words &amp; manner of Expre&s;&s;ion, of almo&s;t any Man. He was quite &s;ingular and inimitable in this, by any who have not a Spirit of real and undi&s;&s;embled Devotion. Yet he always expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with Decency &amp; Propriety. He appeared to have much of the Grace and Spirit of Prayer; to pray with the Spirit and with the Under&s;tanding: and he perform'd this part of Duty much to the acceptance and edification of tho&s;e who joined with him. He was not wont, in ordinary Ca&s;es to be long in his Prayers: an error which he ob&s;erved wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> often hurtful to publick and &s;ocial Prayer, as it tends ra|ther to damp than promote true Devotion.</P>
<P>HE kept him&s;elf quite free from worldly Cares. He gave him&s;elf wholly to the Work of the Mini&s;try, and entangled not him&s;elf with the Affairs of this Life. He left the par|ticular Over-&s;ight and Direction of the temporal Concerns of his Family, almo&s;t entirely to Mrs. <HI>Edwards;</HI> who was better able than mo&s;t of her Sex to take the whole Care of them on her Hands. He was le&s;s acquainted with mo&s;t of his temporal Affairs than many of his Neighbours; and &s;eldom knew when and by whom his Forrage for Winter was gathered in, or how many milk Kine he had; whence his Table was furni&s;hed &amp;c.</P>
<P>HE did not make it his Cu&s;tom to vi&s;it his People in their own Hou&s;es, unle&s;s he was &s;ent for by the Sick; or he heard that they were under &s;ome &s;pecial Affliction. In &s;tead of vi&s;iting from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, he u&s;ed to preach fre|quently at private Meetings in particular Neighbourhoods; and often call the young People and Children to his own Hou&s;e: when he u&s;ed to pray with them &amp; treat with them in a manner &s;uited to their Years &amp; Circum&s;tances. And he catechized the Children in publick every Sabbath in the Sum|mer. And he u&s;ed &s;ometimes to propo&s;e Que&s;tions to particu|lar young Per&s;ons in writing, for them to an&s;wer after a proper
<PB N="50" REF="009961_0058_0F7B3F385691C178">
time given to them to prepare. In putting out the&s;e Que&s;tions he endeavoured to &s;uit them to the Age, Genius and Abilities of tho&s;e to whom they were given. His Que&s;tions were generally &s;uch as required but a &s;hort An&s;|wer; and yet could not be an&s;wered without a particular Knowledge of &s;ome hi&s;torical Part of the Scripture; and therefore led, and even obliged Per&s;ons to &s;tudy the Bible.</P>
<P>HE did not neglect vi&s;iting his People from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, becau&s;e he did not look upon it, in ordinary Ca&s;es, to be one Part of the Work of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter. But he &s;uppo&s;ed that Mini&s;ters &s;hould, with re&s;pect to this, con&s;ult their own Talents and Circum&s;tances, and vi&s;it more or le&s;s, according to the degree in which they could hope hereby to promote the great Ends of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try. He ob&s;erved, that &s;ome Mini&s;ters had a talent at entertain|ing and profiting by occa&s;ional Vi&s;its among their People. They have Words at Will, and a knack at introducing profitable, religious Di&s;cour&s;e in a free, natural, and, as it were unde&s;igned way. He &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uch had a call to &s;pend a great deal of their time in vi&s;iting their People. But he looked on his Talents to be quite otherwi&s;e. He was not able to enter into a free Conver&s;ation with every Per&s;on he met with, and in an ea&s;y manner turn it to what Topick he plea&s;ed, without the help of others, and, as it may be, again&s;t their Inclination. He therefore found that his vi&s;its of this kind mu&s;t be in a great degree unpro|fitable. And as he was &s;ettled in a great Town, it would take up a great part of his Time to vi&s;it from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e; which he thought he could &s;pend in his Study to much more valuable Purpo&s;es, and &s;o as much better to promote the great Ends of his Mini&s;try. For it appeared to him, that he could do the greate&s;t good to Souls, and mo&s;t promote the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t by preaching and writing, and conver&s;ing with Per&s;ons under religious Im|pre&s;&s;ions in his Study; where he encouraged all &s;uch to re|pair; where, they might be &s;ure, in ordinary Ca&s;es, to find him: and to be allowed ea&s;y acce&s;s to him, and where they were treated with all de&s;irable tenderne&s;s, kindne&s;s &amp; familia|rity. In times therefore of the out-pouring of God's Spirit, and the revival of Religion among his People, his Study was throng'd with Per&s;ons to lay open their &s;piritual Concerns to him, and &s;eek his Advice and Direction: whom he received and conver&s;ed with, with great freedom and plea&s;ure, and
<PB N="51" REF="009961_0059_0F7B3F38F871DFF8">
had the be&s;t Opportunity to deal in the mo&s;t particular man|ner with each one.</P>
<P>HE was a &s;kilful Guide to Souls under &s;piritual Difficul|ties. And was therefore &s;ought unto not only by his own People, but by many who lived &s;cores of Miles off. He became &s;uch an able Guide, partly by his own experimen|tal acquaintance with divine things, and unwearied &s;tudy of God's Word; and partly by his having &s;o much con|cern with Souls under &s;piritual Troubles. For he had not been &s;ettled in the Work of the Mini&s;try many Years be|fore the Spirit of GOD was wonderfully poured out on his People, by which a great Concern about their Souls became almo&s;t univer&s;al; and a great Number were hope|fully the Subjects of &s;aving Conver&s;ion. This was prin|cipally in the Year 1734. A particular Account of which has been wrote by him, entitled, <HI>A faithful Narrative of the &s;urprizing Work of GOD in the Conver&s;ion of many hundred Souls in</HI> Northampton. Which has been printed in Eng|land, Germany and America; to which the Reader mu&s;t be refer'd.</P>
<P>AND there was another remarkable Time of the out|pouring of GOD's Spirit in the Years 1740, &amp; 1741. in which <HI>Northampton</HI> partook largely; tho' not exclu&s;ive of mo&s;t other Parts of the Land. Mr. EDWARDS in this time had to deal not only with his own People, but with Multitudes of others. The hearing that the &s;ame things were at <HI>Northampton</HI> &s;ome Years before, and the fame Mr. EDWARDS had for Knowledge, Piety, and a great Acquain|tance with experimental Religion, naturally led both Mi|ni&s;ters and People, in almo&s;t all Parts of <HI>New-England,</HI> to look to him for Direction and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in this extra-ordinary time. Being in this time earne&s;tly &s;ollicited by the Mini&s;ters &amp; People of many Places to come and preach among them, he went to many; tho' he was not able to gratify all who de&s;ired him. And his preaching was attended with great Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>AND as many of the Mini&s;ters &amp; People in <HI>New-England</HI> had been unacquainted with &s;uch things as then appear|ed, they were greatly expo&s;ed to <HI>run wild,</HI> as it were, and actually did, by the &s;ubtle Temptations of the Devil, tak|ing

Advantage of the Ignorance and Wickedne&s;s of Men's Hearts, go into great Extreams both as Oppo&s;ers &amp; Friends to the Work of GOD. Mr. EDWARDS was greatly help|ful by his Direction and A&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the two op|po&s;ite Extremes, both in Conver&s;ation, Preaching and Wri|ting. His Publications on this Occa&s;ion were e&s;pecially of great and exten&s;ive Service. Of which it may be proper to give &s;ome Account here.</P>

<P>Mr. EDWARDS was what by &s;ome is called a rigid <HI>Cal|vini&s;t.</HI> Tho&s;e Doctrines of Calvini&s;m, which have been mo&s;t objected again&s;t, and given the greate&s;t Offence, ap|peared to him as &s;criptural, rea&s;onable and important as any; and he thought that to give them up, was in effect to give up all. And therefore he looked upon tho&s;e who called them&s;elves <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> that were for palliating the Matter, by, as it were, triming off the Knots of Calvini&s;m, that they might conform it more to the ta&s;te of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to object again&s;t it, were really giving up and betraying the Cau&s;e they pretended to e&s;pou&s;e: and were paving the way not only to Arminiani&s;m, but to Dei&s;m. For if the&s;e Doctrines, in the whole length and breadth of them were relinqui&s;hed, he did not &s;ee, where a Man could &s;et his Foot down with con&s;i&s;tency and &s;afety, &s;hort of Dei&s;m, or even Athei&s;m it &s;elf; or rather univer&s;al Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p|tici&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="009961_0061_0F7B3F3A39C9E260">HE judg'd that nothing was wanting, but to have the&s;e Doctrines properly &s;tated and judiciou&s;ly and well defend|ed, in order to their appearing mo&s;t agreable to Rea&s;on and common Sen&s;e, as well as the Doctrines of Revelation; and that this therefore was the only effectual Method to convince, or &s;ilence and &s;hame the oppo&s;ers of them.

<P>IN this view of Things, he thought it of Impor|tance that Mini&s;ters &s;hould be very critical in examining Candidates for the Mini&s;try, with Re&s;pect to their <HI>Princi|ples,</HI> as well as their religious Di&s;po&s;ition and Morals.

<HEAD>SECTION II. His DISMISSION from <HI>Northampton,</HI> with the <HI>Oc|ca&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> of it.</HEAD>
<P>MR. EDWARDS was very happy in the e&s;teem and love of his People for many Years, and there was the greate&s;t Pro&s;pect of his living and dying &s;o. He was the la&s;t Mini&s;ter almo&s;t in <HI>New-England</HI> that would have been pitched upon to be oppo&s;ed and renounced by his People. But by what has come to pa&s;s with re&s;pect to this, we have an in&s;tructive Le&s;&s;on on the in&s;tability of all human Affairs, and the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of tru&s;ting in Man.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1744. Mr. EDWARDS was informed that &s;ome of the young Per&s;ons in Town, who were Members of the Church, had Books in keeping, which they im|proved to promote la&s;civious and ob&s;cene Di&s;cour&s;e among
<PB N="54" REF="009961_0062_0F7B3F3B1CA13558">
the young Poople. And upon inquiring, a Number of Per&s;ons were found to te&s;tify, that they had heard one and another from time to time talk ob&s;cenely; as what they were led to by reading a Book or Books, which they had among them. Upon which Mr. EDWARDS thought the Brethren of the Church ought to look into the Matter. And in order to introduce it, he preach'd a Sermon from <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 15, 16. <Q>Looking diligently, le&s;t any Man fail of the Grace of GOD, le&s;t any Root of bitterne&s;s &s;pringing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled: le&s;t there be any Fornicator, or profane Per&s;on as E&s;au &amp;c.</Q> After Sermon, he de&s;ired the Brethren of the Church to &s;tay, and told them what Information he had got; and propo&s;ed whether they thought proper to take any Mea&s;ures to exa|mine into the Matter. They with one con&s;ent, and much Zeal, manife&s;ted it to be their Opinion, that it ought to be enquired into. And proceeded to cho&s;e a Number of Men, to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Pa&s;tor in examining into the Affair. Upon which Mr. EDWARDS appointed the time for their meeting at his Hou&s;e: and then read a Catalogue of the Names of young Per&s;ons, whom he de&s;ired to come to his Hou&s;e at the &s;ame time. Some were the accu&s;ed, and &s;ome Witne&s;&s;es; but it was not then declared of which Number any particular Per&s;on was.</P>
<P>WHEN the Names were publi&s;hed, it appeared, that there were but few of the con&s;iderable Families in Town, to which none of the Per&s;ons named did belong, or were nearly related. Whether this was the Occa&s;ion of the alteration or not, before the Day appointed came, a great Number of Heads of Families altered their Minds (yea many condemn|ed what they had done, before they got home to their own Hou&s;es) and declared, they did not think proper to proceed as they had done; that their Children &s;hould not be called to an Account in &s;uch a way for &s;uch things &amp;c. &amp;c. And the Town was &s;uddenly all on a Blaze. This &s;trengthen'd the Hands of the accu&s;ed, and &s;ome refu&s;ed to appear, and others that did appear, behaved unmannerly, and with a great Degree of In&s;olence, and contempt of the Autho|rity of the Church. And little or nothing could be done further in the Affair.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="009961_0063_0F7B3F3D8F9D0648">THIS was the Occa&s;ion of weakening Mr. EDWARDS's Hands in the Work of the Mini&s;try, e&s;pecially among the young People; with whom by this Means he greatly lo&s;t his Influence! This &s;eemed in a great Mea&s;ure to put an end to Mr. EDWARDS's U&s;efulne&s;s at <HI>Northampton,</HI> and doubtle&s;s laid a Foundation, and will help to account for the &s;urprizing Events which will by and by be related. To be &s;ure he had no great vi&s;ible Succe&s;s after this; but the Influences of God's Spirit were greatly with-held, and &s;e|curity and carnality much increa&s;ed among them. That great and &s;ingular degree of vi&s;ible religion and good order which had been found among them, &s;oon began gradually to decay: and the youth have &s;ince been more wanton and di&s;&s;olute.</P>
<P>Mr. STODDARD, Mr. EDWARDS's grand-father and pre|dece&s;&s;or in the work of the mini&s;try, was of the opinion, that unconverted per&s;ons had a right in the &s;ight of God, or con&s;ider'd as &s;uch, to the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup|per; that therefore it was their duty to come to that ordi|nance, tho' they knew they had no true goodne&s;s, or go&s;pel holine&s;s. He maintain'd, that vi&s;ible chri&s;tianity does not con&s;i&s;t in a profe&s;&s;ion or appearance of that wherein true holine&s;s or real chri&s;tianity con&s;i&s;ts. That therefore the profe&s;&s;ion which per&s;ons make in order to be re|ceived as vi&s;ible Members of Chri&s;t's Church, ought not to be &s;uch as to expre&s;s or imply a real compliance with, or con&s;ent to the terms of the covenant of grace, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">earty embracing the go&s;pel. So that they who really reject Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and di&s;like the go&s;pel way of &s;alvation in their hearts, and know that this is true of them&s;elves may make the pro|fe&s;&s;ion without lying and hypocri&s;y. Accordingly he en|deavoured to form a &s;hort profe&s;&s;ion for per&s;ons to make in order to be admitted into the church and come to the &s;acrament, an&s;werable to this principle. And it took place and was practi&s;ed upon in <HI>Northampton;</HI> and per&s;ons were admitted into the church, and to the &s;acrament, not under the notion of their being true &s;aints, or that they had any real goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. STODDARD's appearing to maintain this principle made a great noi&s;e in the country; and he was oppo&s;ed as introducing &s;omething contrary to the principles and
<PB N="56" REF="009961_0064_0F7B3F3ED49F3878">
practice of almo&s;t all the churches in <HI>New-England.</HI> And the matter was publickly controverted between him and Dr. INCREASE MATHER of <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> However, thro' Mr. STODDARD's great influence &amp; a&s;cendance over the People at <HI>Northampton,</HI> it was introduced there, tho' not without Oppo|&s;ition. And his principles by degrees &s;pread very much a|mong Mini&s;ters &amp; People in that county, and in other parts of <HI>New England;</HI> tho' no church except <HI>Northampton</HI> publick|ly and profe&s;&s;edly acted upon this principle, by altering the profe&s;&s;ion that tho&s;e made, who were admitted to the Sa|crament, to &s;uit it to &s;uch a notion: but required of all who joined to the church a profe&s;&s;ion of that wherein true chri&s;tianity, or real godline&s;s con&s;i&s;ts. And of late years his opinion that per&s;ons who have no real goodne&s;s, but are in a chri&s;tle&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tate, and know them&s;elves to be &s;o, may make a chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion and come to the Sacrament, without lying and hypocri&s;y; and that they have a right, and 'tis their duty &s;o to do, has greatly &s;pread in the country.</P>
<P>Mr. EDWARDS had &s;ome he&s;itation about this matter when he fir&s;t &s;ettled at <HI>Northampton,</HI> and afterwards; but did not receive &s;uch a degree of conviction, that the ad|mitting per&s;ons into the church, who made no pretence to real godline&s;s was wrong, as to prevent his practi&s;ing upon it with a good con&s;cience, for &s;ome years. But at length his doubts about the matter greatly increa&s;ed, which put him upon examining it more thoroughly than he had ever before done, by &s;earching the Scripture, and reading and examining &s;uch books, as were written to defend the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons to &s;acraments, without a profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aving faith. And the re&s;ult was a full conviction that it was wrong, and that he could not practi&s;e upon it with a good Con&s;cience. He was fully convinced that to be a <HI>vi&s;ible Chri&s;tian</HI> was to put on the vi&s;ibility or appearance of a real chri&s;tian; that the profe&s;&s;ion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> chri&s;tianity was a profe&s;&s;ion of that, wherein real chri&s;tianity con&s;i&s;ts; was therefore a profe&s;&s;ion of true re&s;pect of Chri&s;t, and a hearty embracing the go&s;pel &amp;c. That therefore no per&s;on who rejected Chri&s;t in his heart, could make &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;tent with truth. And therefore, as the Ordinance of the Lord's Supper was in&s;tituted for none but vi&s;ible profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians, none but tho&s;e who are real chri&s;tians have a real right in the &s;ight of God to come to that ordi|nance:
<PB N="57" REF="009961_0065_0F7B3F3FF8BAD7A8">
and that none ought to be admitted thereto, who do not make a profe&s;&s;ion of real chri&s;tianity, and &s;o can|not be received in a judgment of charity as true friends to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or real &s;aints. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">THEY who have a de&s;ire more fully to under&s;tand this contro|ver&s;y, and know if it is ju&s;tly repre&s;ented here may do it by reading what Mr. Edwards wrote on this occa&s;ion, in order to explain and vindicate his principles; together with the Rev. Mr. Williams's an&s;wer, and Mr. Edwards's reply to him. And if they plea&s;e, they may con&s;ult what Dr. Mather, and Mr. Stoddard before wrote on this &s;ubject.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN Mr. EDWARDS's &s;entiments were known, in the &s;pring of the year 1744, it gave great offence, and the town was put into a great ferment: and before he was heard in his own defence, or it was known by many what his principles were, the general cry was to have him di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, as what alone would &s;atisfy them. This was evident from the whole tenor of their conduct, as they neg|lected and oppos'd the mo&s;t proper means of calmly con|&s;idering, and &s;o under&s;tanding the matter in di&s;pute, and per&s;i&s;ted in a refu&s;al to attend to what Mr. EDWARDS had to &s;ay in defence of his principles. And f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om beginning to end oppos'd the mea&s;ures which had the be&s;t tendency to compromi&s;e and heal the difficulty; and with much zeal pur&s;ued tho&s;e, which were calculated to make a &s;epa|ration certain and &s;peedy.</P>
<P>Mr. EDWARDS thought of preaching on the &s;ubject, that they might know what were his &s;entiments, and what were the grounds of them, (of both which he was &s;en&s;ible the mo&s;t of them were quite ignorant) before they took any &s;tep for a &s;eparation between him and his people. But that he might do nothing to increa&s;e the tumult, but on the con|trary take all tho&s;e &s;teps, which he could with a good con&s;|cience, that tended to peace, he fir&s;t propo&s;ed the thing to the church's &s;tanding committee; &s;uppo&s;ing that if he entered on the &s;ubject publickly with their con&s;ent, it would prevent the ill con&s;equences which otherwi&s;e he fear'd would follow. But the mo&s;t of them by no means con&s;ent to it, but &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed it. Upon which he gave it over for the pre&s;ent, as what in &s;uch circum&s;tances would rather rai&s;e a tumult, and blow the fire up to a greater height, than an&s;wer the good ends propo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="009961_0066_0F7B3F404BCF3D38">Mr. EDWARDS being &s;en&s;ible that his principles were not under&s;tood, and much mi&s;repre&s;ented thro' the coun|try; and finding that his people were in too much of a heat calmly to attend to the matter in controver&s;y then; and were in a di&s;po&s;ition even to refu&s;e to hear him preach upon it, propo&s;ed to print what he had to &s;ay on the point; as this &s;eemed to be the only way left him to have a fair hearing. Accordingly his people con&s;ented to put off the calling a council, till what he &s;hould write was publi&s;hed. But they manife&s;ted great unea&s;ine&s;s in waiting, before it came out of the pre&s;s. And when it was publi&s;hed, it was read but by very few of them. Mr. EDWARDS being &s;en&s;ible of this, renewed his propo&s;al to preach upon it, and at a meeting of the brethren of the church a&s;ked their con&s;ent in the following terms: <Q>I de&s;ire that the brethren would manife&s;t their con&s;ent, that I &s;hould declare the rea&s;ons of my opinion relating to full communion in the church, in lectures appointed for that end: Not as an act of authority, or as putting the power of declaring the whole coun&s;el of God out of my hands; but for peace &s;ake, and to prevent occa&s;ion of &s;trife.</Q></P>
<P>But it pa&s;s'd in the negative.</P>
<P>Mr. EDWARDS then propo&s;ed that it &s;hould be left to a few of the neighbouring mini&s;ters, whether it was not, all things con&s;ider'd, rea&s;onable that he &s;hould be heard in this matter from the pulpit, before the affair &s;hould be brought to an i&s;&s;ue. But this al&s;o pa&s;s'd in the negative.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, he having had the advice of the mini&s;ters and me&s;&s;engers of the neighbouring churches, who met at <HI>Northampton</HI> to advi&s;e them under their difficulties, proceed|ed to appoint a lecture, in order to preach on the &s;ubject, propo&s;ing to do &s;o weekly 'till he had fini&s;hed what he had to &s;ay. On Monday there was a precinct or &s;ociety meeting, in which a vote was pa&s;s'd to choo&s;e a committee to go to Mr. EDWARDS, and de&s;ire him not to preach lectures on the &s;ubject in controver&s;y, according to his declaration and ap|pointment. And accordingly, proceeded to choo&s;e a com|mittee of three men for this purpo&s;e, who waited on him, and did their errand. However, Mr. EDWARDS thought proper to proceed according to his propo&s;al, and accord|ingly preached a number of Sermons till he had fini&s;hed
<PB N="59" REF="009961_0067_0F7B3F410C09C980">
what he had to &s;ay on the &s;ubject. The&s;e lectures were very thinly attended by his own people: but great numbers of &s;trangers from the neighbouring towns attended them, &s;o many as to make above half the congregation. This was in <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March</HI> 1750.</P>
<P>THE calling a deci&s;ive council to determine the matter of difference between pa&s;tor and people, or rather to di&s;|mi&s;s the pa&s;tor from his church and people, (for the delay of which a great deal of impatience had been publickly ma|nife&s;ted) was now more particularly attended to by Mr. EDWARDS and the church.</P>
<P>Mr. EDWARDS had before this in&s;i&s;ted upon it from time to time, that they were by no means ripe for &s;uch a pro|ceedure; (as they had not yet given him a fair hearing in defence of his cau&s;e: which if they would do, perhaps the need of &s;uch a council would be &s;uper&s;ceeded. And be|&s;ides, he thought there was abundant publick evidence, that they were not yet in a temper &s;uited to attend on, and be active in &s;uch a tran&s;action, as the di&s;&s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the rela|tion between them and their pa&s;tor; which would, as things then &s;tood, probably be the event. He ob&s;erved, <Q>That it was exceeding unbecoming churches of the Lamb of God to manage their religious affairs of greate&s;t importance in a ferment and tumult, which ought to be managed with great &s;olemnity, deep humiliation and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the awful frowns of heaven, humble de|pendence on God, and with fervent prayer and &s;upplica|tion to him. That therefore for them to go about &s;uch an affair, in &s;uch a manner as they did, would be mo&s;t unbecoming the Go&s;pel, greatly to the di&s;honor of God and religion, and a way in which a people cannot expect a ble&s;&s;ing. That &s;uch a great affair as this &s;hould be gone about with ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m con&s;ideration; but that &s;uch a temper as the people were then in, was wholly incon|&s;i&s;tent with this.</Q></P>
<P>BUT having u&s;ed all means which he could think of within his Power to bring them to a more calm and cha|ritable temper, and to hear and weigh what he had to &s;ay in his own defence, with attention and candor; and find|ing that nothing prevailed; but rather the tumult and up|roar
<PB N="60" REF="009961_0068_0F7B3F41D3209758">
was increa&s;ed; he con&s;ented that a deci&s;ive council &s;hould be called without any further delay.</P>
<P>BUT a difficulty attended the choice of a council, which was for &s;ome time in&s;uperable. It was agreed that the council &s;hould be mutually cho&s;en, one half by the pa&s;tor, and the other half by the church: but the people in&s;i&s;ted upon it that he &s;hould be confined to the county in his choice. Mr. EDWARDS thought this an unrea&s;onable re|&s;traint on him, as it was known that the mini&s;ters and churches in that county were almo&s;t univer&s;ally again&s;t him in the controver&s;y that divided him and his people, and made the two parties. He indeed did not &s;uppo&s;e that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the propo&s;ed council would be to determine whether his opinion which was the occa&s;ion of the diffi|culty between him and his people was right or no; or that what they were to judge of, depended upon this. But their bu&s;ine&s;s would be &mdash; to &s;ee and determine whether any po&s;&s;ible way could be devi&s;ed for an accommodation between pa&s;tor and people, and to u&s;e their wi&s;dom and endeavour in order to this. And if they found this im|practicable, they mu&s;t determine, whether things were now ripe for a &s;eparation; whether what ought in ju&s;tice to be previous to a &s;eparation had already actually been done, &s;o that there was nothing further in ju&s;tice to be de|manded by either of the parties concerned, before a &s;epa|ration &s;hould take place. And if he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by them, it would be their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;et forth to the world in what manner and for what cau&s;e he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: how far he was innocent, and whether he might yet be employed in the work of the mini&s;try &amp;c. All which were matters of great importance to him, and required upright and impartial judges. And con&s;idering the great influence a difference in religious opinions has to prejudice men one again&s;t another; and the clo&s;e connection of the point, in which mo&s;t of the mini&s;ters and churches in the county differ'd from him, with the matter to be judged of, he did not think they could be rea&s;onably looked upon &s;o impartial judges, as that the matter ought to be wholly left to them. Be&s;ides, he thought the ca&s;e being &s;o new and extraordinary, required the able&s;t judges in the land. For the&s;e, and &s;ome other rea&s;ons, which he offered, he in&s;i&s;ted up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n liberty to go out of the county
<PB N="61" REF="009961_0069_0F7B3F4280055F00">
for tho&s;e members of the propo&s;ed council, in which he was to have a choice. In this, as was ju&s;t now &s;aid, the people &s;trenuou&s;ly and ob&s;tinately oppo&s;ed him. They at length agreed to leave the matter to a council con&s;i&s;ting of the mini&s;ters and me&s;&s;engers of the five neighbouring chur|ches: who, after they had met twice upon it, and had the ca&s;e largely debated before them, were equally divided, and therefore left the matter undetermined.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, they were all agreed, that Mr. EDWARDS ought to have liberty to go out of the county for <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the council. And at the next church meeting, which was on the 26th of <HI>March,</HI> Mr. EDWARDS offer'd to join with them in calling a council, if they would con&s;ent that he &s;hould chu&s;e <HI>two</HI> of the churches out of the county, in ca&s;e the council con&s;i&s;ted of but <HI>ten</HI> churches. The church how|ever refu&s;ed to comply with this at one meeting after ano|ther repeatedly; and proceeded to warn a church meeting and choo&s;e a moderator, in order to act without their pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>BUT, to pa&s;s by many particulars, at lenth at a meeting of the church, warned by their pa&s;tor, <HI>May</HI> 3d. they voted their con&s;ent to his propo&s;al of going out of the county for two of the churches, &s;hould be applied to. And then they proceeded to make choice of the ten mini&s;ters &amp; chur|ches, of which the council &s;hould con&s;i&s;t. Accordingly, the churches were &s;ent to, and the council convened on the 19th of <HI>June.</HI> Who, after they had made &s;ome fruitle&s;s attempts for a compo&s;ition between the pa&s;tor and church, pa&s;s'd a re&s;olve, by the majority of one voice <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">One of the churches which Mr. <HI>Edward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> cho&s;e did not &s;ee fit to join the council. However, the mini&s;ter of that church being at <HI>Northampton</HI> at the &s;itting of the Council, was de|&s;ired by Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and the Church to &s;it in Council and act, which he did. But there being no me&s;&s;enger from the Church, the council was not full, and there was a di&s;parity; by which means doubtle&s;s, there was <HI>Our</HI> vote more for an immediate di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, than again&s;t it.</NOTE> only, to the following purpo&s;e: "That 'tis expedient that the pa&s;to|ral relation between Mr. EDWARDS and his church be immediately di&s;&s;olved, if the people &s;till per&s;i&s;t in de&s;iring it." And it being publickly put to the people, whether they &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on Mr. EDWARDS's di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the pa&s;toral office over them? A great majority (above two hundred again&s;t twenty) zealou&s;ly voted for his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. And he was accordingly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <HI>June</HI> 22, 1750.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="009961_0070_0F7B3F439EE3FD50">THE di&s;&s;enting part of the council, enter'd their pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t again&s;t this proceeding, judging that it was too much in a hurry, as they were by no means ripe for a &s;eparation, con|&s;idering the pa&s;t conduct, and pre&s;ent temper of the peo|ple. And &s;ome of that part of the council that were active, expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves &s;urprized at the uncommon zeal and engagedne&s;s of &s;pirit, publickly manife&s;ted by the people in their voting for a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; which evidenced to them, and all ob&s;erving &s;pectators, that they were far from a tem|per of mind becoming &s;uch a &s;olemn and awful tran&s;action, con&s;idered in all its circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>BEING thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, he preached his farewell Sermon on the fir&s;t of <HI>July,</HI> from 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 14. The doctrine he ob&s;erved from the words was this, <Q>Mini&s;ters and the people that have been under their care, mu&s;t meet one another before Chri&s;t's tribunal, at the day of Judgment.</Q>
It was a remarkably &s;olemn and affecting di&s;cour&s;e, and was publi&s;hed at the de&s;ire of &s;ome of the hearers.</P>
<P>AFTER Mr. EDWARDS was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from <HI>Northampton,</HI> he preached there &s;ome times occa&s;ionally when they had no other preacher to &s;upply the pulpit; till at length a great unea&s;ine&s;s was manife&s;ted by many of the people, at his preaching there at all. Upon which, the committee for &s;upplying the pulpit, call'd the town together, to know their minds with re&s;pect to that matter: when they voted that it was not agreeable to their minds, that he &s;hould preach among them. Accordingly, when Mr. EDWARDS was in town, and they had no other mini&s;ter to preach to them, they carried on publick wor&s;hip among them&s;elves, and without any preaching, rather than to invite Mr. ED|WARDS!</P>
<P>EVERY one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that this was a great trial to Mr. EDWARDS. He had been near twenty four years among that people; and his labours had been, to all appearance, from time to time greatly ble&s;&s;ed among them: and a great number looked on him as their &s;piritual father, who had been the happy in&s;trument of turning them from darkne&s;s to light, and plucking them as brands out of the burning. And they had from time to time profe&s;&s;ed that they looked upon it as one of their greate&s;t priviledges to have &s;uch a

mini&s;ter, and manife&s;ted their great love and e&s;teem of him, to &s;uch a degree; that, (as St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays of the Ga|latians) if it had been po&s;&s;ible, they would have pluck'd out their own eyes, and given them to him. And they had a great intere&s;t in <HI>his</HI> heart: He had borne them on his heart and carried them in his bo&s;om for many years; exerci&s;ing a tender concern and love for them: for their good he was always writing, contriving, labouring; for them he had poured out ten thou&s;and fervent prayers; in their good he had rejoyced as one that findeth great &s;poil; and they were dear to him above any other people under heaven.</P>
<P>NOW to have <HI>this people</HI> turn again&s;t him, and thru&s;t him out from among them, in a great tumult and heat, with ha&s;te, and a great degree of violence; like the Jews of old &s;toping their ears and runing upon him with furi|ous zeal, not allowing him to defend him&s;elf by giving him a fair hearing; and even refu&s;ing &s;o much as to hear him preach; many of them &s;urmi&s;ing and publickly &s;peak|ing many ill things as to his ends and de&s;igns! To have the tables turned &s;o &s;uddenly and the voice &s;o general and loud again&s;t him. This &s;urely mu&s;t come very near to him, and try his &s;pirit. The words of the p&s;almi&s;t &s;eems applicable to this ca&s;e, <Q>It was not an enemy that reproach|ed me, then I could have borne it; neither was it he that hated me, that did magnify him&s;elf again&s;t me, then I would have hid my &s;elf from him. But it was THOU&mdash; my guide and mine acquaintance. We took &s;weet coun|&s;el together, and walked unto the hou&s;e of God in com|pany.</Q></P>
<P>LET us therefore now <HI>behold the man!</HI></P>
<P>THE calm and &s;edatene&s;s of his mind; his meekne&s;s and humility in great and violent oppo&s;ition, and injurious treatment; his re&s;olution and &s;teady conduct thro' all this dark and terrible &s;torm, were truly wonderful, and cannot be &s;et in &s;o beautiful and affecting a light by any de&s;crip|tion, as they appeared in to his friends, who were eye|witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Mr. EDWARDS had a numerous and chargeable family, and little or no income, exclu&s;ive of his &s;alary: and con|&s;idering how far he was advanced in years; the general
<PB N="64" REF="009961_0072_0F7B3F44C3E1DDB0">
di&s;po&s;ition of people who want a mini&s;ter to prefer a young man who has never been &s;ettled, to one who has been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his people; and what mi&s;repre&s;entations were made of his principles thro' the country, it looked to him not at all probable that he &s;hould ever have oppor|tunity to be &s;ettled again in the work of the mini&s;try, if he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from <HI>Northampton:</HI> And he was not inclined or able to take any other cour&s;e, or go into any other bu&s;ine&s;s to get a living. So that beggery as well as di&s;grace &s;tared him full in the face, if he per&s;i&s;ted in his principles. To be &s;ure, he viewed him&s;elf as taking the mo&s;t direct way to the&s;e, according to the natural cour&s;e of things, by di&s;covering and adhering to his principles, in the &s;ituation he then was. For he for&s;aw all this, before it came upon him; and there|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore had the opportunity and the temptation to e&s;cape it, by concealing his principles. When he was fixed in his prin|cples, and before they were publickly known, he told &s;ome of his friends, that if he di&s;covered and per&s;i&s;ted in them, it would mo&s;t likely i&s;&s;ue in his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion and di&s;|grace; and the ruin of him&s;elf and family, as to their temporal intere&s;ts. He therefore fir&s;t &s;at down and counted the co&s;t, and deliberately took up the cro&s;s, when it was &s;et before him in its full weight and magnitude; and in direct oppo&s;ition to all worldly views and motives. And therefore his conduct in the&s;e circum&s;tances, was a re|markable exerci&s;e and di&s;covery of his con&s;cientiou&s;ne&s;s; and his readine&s;s to deny him&s;elf, and for&s;ake all that he had, to follow Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>A man mu&s;t have a con&s;iderable degree of the &s;pirit of a martyr, not to flinch in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this; but go on with the &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s &amp; re&s;olution with which he did. He, as it were, put his life in his hand, and ventur'd on where truth and duty appear'd to lead him, unmov'd at the threatning dangers on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, God did not for&s;ake him. As he gave him tho&s;e inward &s;upports by which he was able in patience to po&s;&s;e&s;s his &s;oul, and calmly and couragiou&s;ly row on in the &s;torm, as it were, in the face of boi&s;trous winds, beat|ing hard upon him, and in the mid&s;t of gaping waves threatning to &s;wallow him up: &s;o he &s;oon appear'd for him,

in his providence, even beyond all his expectations. His corre&s;pondents and other friends in Scotland, hearing of his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and fearing it might be the means of bringing him into worldly &s;traits, generou&s;ly contributed a hand&s;ome &s;um, and &s;ent it over to him.</P>
<P>AND God did not leave him without tender, valuable friends at <HI>Northampton.</HI> For a &s;mall number of his people who oppos'd his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the beginning, and &s;ome who acted on neither &s;ide, who joined with him after his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and adhered to him, under the influence of that great e&s;teem and love of Mr. EDWARDS were willing and thought them&s;elves able to maintain him: and in&s;i&s;ted upon it that it was his duty to &s;tay among them, as a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate congregation from the body of the town, who had rejected him.</P>
<P>Mr. EDWARDS could not &s;ee it to be his duty to &s;tay among them, as circum&s;tances were; as this would pro|bably be a means of perpetuating an unhappy divi&s;ion in the town; and there was to him no pro&s;pect of doing the good there, which would counterbalance the evil. How|ever, that he might do all he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould to &s;atisfy his tender and afflicted friends; and becau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> multitude of coun|&s;ellors there is &s;afety, he con&s;ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to a&s;k the advice of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council.

<P>THE town on this occa&s;ion was put into great tumult and fire.

<SALUTE>Rev. Sir.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have often wi&s;hed that every Member of the two eccle&s;ia&s;tical councils (that formerly &s;at in <HI>Northampton</HI> upon the unhappy differences between our former mo&s;t worthy and reverend pa&s;tor Mr. <HI>Jonathan Edwards</HI> and the church here) whereof you was a member; I &s;ay <HI>Sir,</HI> I have often wi&s;h'd every of them truly knew my real &s;en&s;e of my own conduct in the affairs that the one and the other of &s;aid councils are privy to; and as I have long appre|hended it to be my duty not only to humble my &s;elf before God for what was unchri&s;tian and &s;inful, in my conduct before &s;aid councils, but al&s;o to confe&s;s my faults to them, and take &s;hame to my &s;elf therefor before them I have often &s;tudied with my &s;elf in what manner it was practicable for me to do it; and when I under&s;tood that you <HI>Sir,</HI> and Mr <HI>Eato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> were to be at <HI>Cold Spring</HI> at the time of their late council, I re&s;olved to improve the oppor|tunity fully to open my mind there to you and him thereon; and thought that probably &s;ome method might be then thought of in which my reflections on my &s;elf touching the matters above hinted
<PB N="67" REF="009961_0075_0F7B3F46F8CCA640">
at, might be communicated to mo&s;t if not all the gentlemen a|fore&s;aid, who did not re&s;ide in this county: but you know, <HI>Sir,</HI> how difficult it was for us to conver&s;e together by our &s;elves when at <HI>Cold-Spring,</HI> without giving umbrage to that people; I there|fore propo&s;ed writing to you upon the matters which I had then opportunity only mo&s;t &s;ummarily to &s;ugge&s;t; which you <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;ig|nified would be agrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le to you. I therefore now undertake what I then propo&s;ed, in which I humbly a&s;k the divine aid; and that I may be made mo&s;t freely willing fully to confe&s;s my &s;in and guilt to you and the world in tho&s;e in&s;tances which I have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e fell under your notice, as they were publick and noto|rious tran&s;actions, and on account whereof, therefore, you <HI>Sir,</HI> and all others who had knowledge thereof, had ju&s;t cau&s;e to be offended at me.</P>
<P>And in the fir&s;t place <HI>Sir,</HI> I apprehend that with the Church and People of <HI>Northampton,</HI> I &s;inned and erred exceedingly in con|&s;enting and labouring that there &s;hould be &s;o early a di&s;m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> from his pa&s;toral relation to us, even upon the &s;up|po&s;ition that he was really in a mi&s;take in the di&s;puted point: not only becau&s;e the di&s;pute was upon matters &s;o very di&s;putable in them&s;elves and at the greate&s;t remove from fundamental, but be|cau&s;e Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> &s;o long had approved him&s;elf a mo&s;t faithful and painful pa&s;tor to &s;aid church; and al&s;o changed his &s;entiments in that point wholly from a tender regard to what appeared to him to be truth; and had made known his &s;entiments with great modera|tion and upon great deliberation, again&s;t all worldly motives, and from mere fidelity to his great ma&s;ter, and a tender regard to the &s;ouls of his flock, as we had the highe&s;t rea&s;on to judge: which con&s;iderations now &s;eem to me &s;ufficient; and would (if we had been of a right &s;pirit) have greatly endeared him to his people, and made us to the la&s;t degree, reluctant to parting with him, and di&s;|po&s;ed us to the exerci&s;e of the greate&s;t candour, gentlene&s;s and moderation&punc; how much of the rever&s;e whereof appear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in us. I need not tell you <HI>Sir,</HI> who was an eye witne&s;s of our temper and conduct.</P>
<P>And altho' it does not become me to pronounce deci&s;ively on a point &s;o di&s;putable as what was then in di&s;pute; yet I beg leave to &s;ay, that I really apprehend that it is of the highe&s;t mo|ment to the body of this church, and to me in particular, mo&s;t &s;o|licitou&s;ly to enquire, whether like the Phari&s;ees and Lawyers in John Bapti&s;t's time we did not reject the coun&s;el of God again&s;t our &s;elves, in rejecting Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and his doctrine: which was the ground of his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. And I humbly conceive that it highly imports us all of this church, mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly and impartially to examine what that mo&s;t worthy and able divine about that time publi&s;hed in &s;upport of the &s;ame, whereby he being dead yet &s;peaketh.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="009961_0076_0F7B3F496BA15F60">But there were three things <HI>Sir,</HI> e&s;pecially in my own par|ticular conduct before the fir&s;t council, which have been ju&s;tly matter of great grief and much trouble to me almo&s;t ever &s;ince, <HI>to wit.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I confe&s;s <HI>Sir,</HI> that I acted very immode&s;tly and abu&s;ively to you, as well as injuriou&s;ly to the church and my &s;elf, when with much zeal and unbecoming a&s;&s;urance, I moved the council that they would interpo&s;e to &s;ilence and &s;top you in an addre&s;s you was making one morning to the people, wherein you was, if I don't mi&s;remember, briefly exhorting them to a tender remembrance of the former affection and harmony that had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them and their reverend pa&s;tor, and the great comfort and profit which they had apprehended that they had received from his mini&s;try; for which <HI>Sir,</HI> I heartily a&s;k your forgivene&s;s; and I think, that we ought in&s;tead of oppo&s;ing an exhortation of that nature, to have received it with all thank|fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Another particular of my conduct before that council, which I now apprehend was criminal, and was owing to the want of that tender affection and reverend re&s;pect and e&s;teem for Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> which he had highly merited of me, was my &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ing the adjournment of the matters &s;ubmitted to that council, for about two months; for which I declare my &s;elf unfeignedly &s;orry; and I with &s;hame remember, that I did it in a peremptory, deci|&s;ive, vehement and very immode&s;t manner.</P>
<P>But <HI>Sir,</HI> the mo&s;t criminal part of my conduct at that time, that I am con&s;cious of, was my exhibiting to that council a &s;et of arguments in writing, the drift whereof was to prove the rea|&s;onablene&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity of Mr. <HI>Edward's</HI> di&s;mi&s;&s;ion in ca&s;e no accommodation was then effected with mutual con&s;ent; which tract by clear implication contained &s;ome &s;evere, uncharitable, and if I don't mi&s;remember, groundle&s;s and &s;landerous imputations on Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and expre&s;&s;ed in b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">guage; and altho' the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iginal draft thereof was not done by me, yet I fooli&s;hly and &s;infully con&s;ented to copy it; and as agent for the church, to read it and deliver it to the council, which I could never have done, if I had not had a wicked reli&s;h for perver&s;e things: which conduct of mine, I confe&s;s was very &s;inful; am per&s;waded was highly provoking to God, and for which I am a&s;hamed, confound|ed, and have nothing to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>As to the church's remon&s;trance (as it was called) which their committee preferr'd to the la&s;t of &s;aid councils, to all which I was con&s;enting, and in the compo&s;ing whereof I was very active, as al&s;o in bringing the church to their vote upon it: I would in the fir&s;t place only ob&s;erve, that I don't remember any thing in that &s;mall part of it which was plainly di&s;cur&s;ive of the expediency of <HI>Mr. Edwards</HI>'s re-&s;ettlement here as pa&s;tor to a part of the
<PB N="69" REF="009961_0077_0F7B3F4A509F5B18">
church, which was very exceptionable; but as to all the re&s;idue, which was much the greate&s;t part thereof (and I am not certain that any part was wholly free) it was every where laided with un|chri&s;tian bitterne&s;s, &s;arca&s;tical and unmannerly in&s;inuations con|tained divers direct, grievous and criminal charges and allegations again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Mr. <HI>Edwards;</HI> which I have &s;ince good rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e were all founded on jealous &amp; uncharitable mi&s;takes and &s;o were really gro&s;s &s;landers, al&s;o many heavy and reproachful charges upon divers of Mr. <HI>Edwards's</HI> adherents, and &s;ome &s;evere cen&s;ures of them all indi&s;criminately; all of which (if not wholly fal&s;e and groundle&s;s) yet were altogether unnece&s;&s;ary, and therefore highly criminal. Indeed I am fully convinced, that the whole of that compo&s;ure, excepting the &s;mall part thereof abovementioned, was totally unchri&s;tian&punc; a &s;candalous, abu&s;ive, injurious libel, again&s;t Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and his particular friends; e&s;pecially the former, and highly provoking and dete&s;table in the &s;ight of God; for which I am heartily &s;orry and a&s;hamed; and pray I may re|member it with deep aba&s;ement and penitence all my days. Nor do I now think that the church's cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct in refu&s;ing to appear and attend before that council to &s;upport <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he charges and allegations in &s;aid remon&s;trance again&s;t Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and &s;aid brethren, which they demanded was ever vindicated by all the &s;ubtle an&s;wers that were given to &s;aid demand; nor do I think that our conduct in that in&s;tance was capable of a defence, for it appears to me, that by making charges of &s;candalous matters again&s;t them before &s;aid council, we nece&s;&s;arily &s;o far gave that council juri&s;diction; and I own with &s;orrow and regret, that I zealou&s;ly endeavoured, that the church &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d per&s;everingly refu&s;e to appear before &s;aid council for the purpo&s;e above&s;aid; which I humbly pray God to forgive.</P>
<P>Another part of my conduct, <HI>Sir,</HI> of which I have long repent|ed, and for which I hereby declare my hearty &s;orrow, was my ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition to the la&s;t council's having any conference with the church; which &s;aid council earne&s;tly and rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atedly moved for, and which the church finally denied (as you know.) I think it di&s;covered a great deal of pride and vain &s;ufficiency in the church, and &s;hewed them to be very opiniative, e&s;pecially the chief &s;ticklers, one of whom I own I was, and think it was running a mo&s;t pre&s;umptuous ri&s;k, and acting the part of proud &s;corners, for us to refu&s;e hearing and candidly and &s;eriou&s;ly con|&s;idering what that council could &s;ay or propo&s;e to us; among whom the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e were divers ju&s;tly in great reputation for grace and wi&s;dom.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. His MISSION to the INDIANS at <HI>Stockbridge</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE India, Mi&s;&s;ion at <HI>Stockbridge</HI> (a Town in the we&s;tern part of the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achusetts-Bay,</HI> &s;ixty Miles from <HI>Northampton</HI>) being vacant by the death of the late reverend Mr. SERGEANT, the honor|ed and reverend Commi&s;&s;ioners for Indian affairs, in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> who have the care and direction of it, applied to him, as the mo&s;t &s;uitable per&s;on they could think of to betru&s;t with
<PB N="73" REF="009961_0081_0F7B3F4DE16CF9F0">
that mi&s;&s;ion. And he was at the &s;ame time invited by the inhabitants of <HI>Stockbridge;</HI> and being advi&s;ed by the council, above mentioned, to accept of the invitation, he repair'd to <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> and was introduced and fixed as mi&s;&s;ionary to the Indians there by an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council call'd for that purpose, <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 8 1751.</P>
<P>WHEN Mr. EDWARDS fir&s;t engaged in the mi&s;&s;ion, there was a hopeful pro&s;pect of it's being exten&s;ively &s;erviceable, under his care and influence; not only to that tribe of Indians which was &s;ettled at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> but among the <HI>Six Nations:</HI> &s;ome of whom were coming to <HI>Stockbridge</HI> to &s;et|tle, and bring their own, and as many of their neighbours children as they could get; to be educated and in&s;tructed there. For this end, a hou&s;e for a boarding &s;chool, which was projected by Mr SERGEANT, was erected on a tract of land appropriated to that u&s;e by the Indians at <HI>Stock|bridge:</HI> where the Indian Children, male and female were to be educated, by being cloath'd and fed, and in&s;tructed by proper per&s;ons in u&s;eful learning. And the boys to be learned hu&s;bandry or mechanic trades, and the girls all &s;orts of women's work. For the encouragement of which, &s;ome generous &s;ub&s;criptions were made both in <HI>Eng|land</HI> and <HI>America.</HI> And the great and general Court of the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> did much to promote the affair, and provided lands for the Mohocks to &s;ettle on, who &s;hould incline to come. And the generous Mr. HOL|LIS, to be encourage the thing, order'd twenty four indian Children to be educated on the &s;ame footing, wholly at his co&s;t. Al&s;o the Society in <HI>London,</HI> for propagating the Gospel among the Indians in and about <HI>New-England,</HI> di|rected their Commi&s;&s;ioners in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to do con&s;iderable to|wards this de&s;ign.</P>
<P>BUT partly by rea&s;on of &s;ome unhappy differences that took place among tho&s;e who had the chief management of this affair at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> of which a particular account would not be proper in this place; and partly by the war's breaking out between England and France, which is ge|nerally very fatal to such affairs among Indians, this hope|ful pro&s;pect came to nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="009961_0082_0F7BD07A96D93A58">Mr. EDWARDS'S labours were attended with no remar|kable va&s;ible &s;ucce&s;s while at <HI>Stockbridge:</HI> tho' he perform'd the bu&s;ine&s;s of his mi&s;&s;ion to the good acceptance of the inhabitants in general, both Engli&s;h and Indians, and of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who &s;upported him honorably, and con|fided very much in his judgment and wi&s;dom in all mat|ters relating to the mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>STOCKBRIDGE proved to Mr. EDWARDS a more quiet, and, on many accounts, a much more comfortable &s;ituation than he was in before. It being &s;o much in one corner of the country, his time was not &s;o much taken up with com|pany, as it was at <HI>Northampton,</HI> tho' many of his friends, from almo&s;t all parts of the land, often made him plea&s;ant and profitable vi&s;its. And he had not &s;o much concern and trouble with other churches as he was obliged to have when at <HI>Northampton,</HI> by being frequently &s;ought to for advice, and call'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t in eccle&s;ia&s;tical councils. Here therefore he followed his beloved &s;tudy more clo&s;ely, and to better purpo&s;e than ever. In the&s;e &s;ix years he doubt|le&s;s made &s;wifter advances in knowledge than ever before, and added more to his Manu&s;cripts than in any &s;ix Years of his life.</P>
<P>AND this was probably as u&s;eful a part of his life as any. For in this time he wrote the two la&s;t books that have been publi&s;hed by him (of which a more particular ac|count will be given hereafter) by which he has doubtle&s;s greatly &s;erved the church of Chri&s;t, and will be a ble&s;&s;ing to many thou&s;ands yet unborn.</P>
<P>THUS, after his uprightne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s had been &s;ufficiently tried at <HI>Northampton,</HI> his kind ma&s;ter provided for him a quiet retreat, which was rendred the more &s;weet by the preceeding &s;torm; and where he had a better op|portunity to pur&s;ue and fini&s;h the work GOD had for him to do.</P>

<P>I Was not a little &s;urprized, on receiving the unexpected No|tice of your having made choice of me to &s;ucceed the late pre&s;ident BURR, as the Head of Na&s;&s;au Hall.&mdash;I am much in doubt whether I am called to undertake the bu&s;ine&s;s, which you have done me the unmerited honour to choo&s;e me for&mdash; If &s;ome regard may be had to my outward comfort, I might mention the many Inconveniencies and great detriment, which mu&s;t be &s;u&s;tained, by my removing with my numerous family, &s;o far from all the e&s;tate I have in the world (without any pro&s;pect of di&s;po&s;ing of it, under pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, with|out lofing it, in great part) now when we have &s;carcely got over the trouble and damage &s;u&s;tained by our removal from Northampton, and have but ju&s;t begun to have our affairs in a comfortable &s;ituation for a &s;ub&s;istence in this place; and the expence I mu&s;t immediately be at to put my self into circum|&s;tance tolerably comporting with the needful &s;upport of the ho|nor of the office I am invited to; which will not well con&s;i&s;t with my ability.&mdash;But this is not my main objection: The

chief difficulty in my mind, in the way of accepting this impor|tant and arduous office, are the&s;e two: Fir&s;t my own defects, un|fitting me for &s;uch an undertaking, many of which are generally known; be&s;ides other, which my own heart is con&s;cious to.&mdash; I have a con&s;titution in many re&s;pects peculiar unhappy, attended with flucid &s;olids, vapid, &s;izy and &s;carce fluids, &amp; a low tide of &s;pirits; often occa&s;ioning a kind of childi&s;h weakne&s;s and contemptible|ne&s;s of &s;peech, pre&s;ence and demeanor; with a di&s;agreable dul|ne&s;s and &s;tiffne&s;s, much unfiting me for conver&s;ation, but more e&s;pecially for the government of a College.&mdash; This poorne&s;s of con&s;titution makes me &s;hrink at the thoughts of taking upon me, in the decline of life, &s;uch a new and great bu&s;ine&s;s, attended with &s;uch a multiplicity of cares, and requiring &s;uch a degree of activity, alertne&s;s and &s;pirit of government; e&s;pecially as &s;uc|ceeding one, &s;o remarkably well qualified in the&s;e re&s;pects, giv|ing occa&s;ion to every one to remark the wide difference. I am al&s;o deficient in &s;ome parts of learning, particularly in Algebra, and the higher parts of Mathematicks, and in the Greek Cla&s;&s;icks; my Greek learning having been chiefly in the new Te&s;tament &mdash; The other thing is this; that my engaging in this bu&s;ine&s;s, will not well con&s;i&s;t, with tho&s;e views, and that cour&s;e of employ in my &s;tudy, which have long engaged, and &s;wallowed up my mind, and been the chief entertainment and delight of my life.&mdash;</P>
<P>And here, honored Sirs, (emboldned by the te&s;timony, I have now received of your unmerited e&s;teem, to rely on your candor) I will with freedom open my &s;elf to you.</P>
<P>My method of &s;tudy, from my fir&s;t beginning the work of the mini&s;try, has been very much by writing; applying my &s;elf in this way, to improve every important hint; pur&s;uing the clew to my utmo&s;t, when any thing in reading&punc; meditation or conver&s;ation, has been &s;ugge&s;ted to my mind, that &s;eemed to promi&s;e light, in any weighty point.&mdash;Thus penning what appeared to me my be&s;t thoughts, on innumerable &s;ubjects for my own benefit. &mdash; The longer I pro&s;ecuted my &s;tudies in this method, the more habitual it became, and the more plea&s;ant and profitable I found it.&mdash;The further I travelled in this way, the more and wider the field opened, which has occa&s;ioned my laying out many things, in my mind, to do in this manner, if God &s;hould &s;pare my life, which my heart hath been much upon: particularly many things again&s;t mo&s;t of the preva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling errors of the pre&s;ent day, which I cannot with any patience &s;ee maintained (to the utter &s;ubverting of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t) with &s;o high a hand, and &s;o long conti|nued a triumph, with &s;o little controul, when it appears &s;o evi|dent to me, that there is truly no foundation for any of this glo|rying and in&s;ult &mdash;I have already publi&s;hed &s;omething on one of the main points in di&s;pute between the Arminians and Calvini&s;ts: and have it in view, God willing (as I have already &s;ignified to the

public) in like manner to con&s;ider all the other controverted points, and have done much towards a preparation for it&mdash; But be|&s;ides the&s;e, I have had on my mind and heart (which I long ago began, not with any view to publication) a great work, which I call a <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Work of Redemption,</HI> a Body of Divinity in an entire new method, being thrown into the form of an hi&s;tory, con|&s;idering the affair of chri&s;tian Theology, as the whole of it, in each part, &s;tands in reference to the great work of redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; which I &s;uppo&s;e is to be the grand de&s;ign, of all God's de&s;igns, and the &s;ummum and ultimum of all the divine operations and degrees; particularly con&s;idering all parts of the grand &s;cheme in their hi&s;torical order.&mdash;The order of their exi&s;t|ence, or their being brought forth to view, in the cour&s;e of divine di&s;pen&s;ations, or the wonderful &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive acts &amp; events; beginning from eternity and de&s;cending from thence to the great work and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive di&s;pen&s;ations of the infinitely wi&s;e God in time, con&s;idering the chief events coming to pa&s;s in the church of God, and revolutions in the world of mankind, affecting the &s;tate of the church and the affair of redemption, which we have account of in hi&s;tory or prophecy; 'till at la&s;t we come to the general Re&s;urrection, la&s;t Judgment, and con&s;ummation of all things; when it t&s;hall be &s;aid, <HI>It it done.

Who upon his, and his people's de&s;ire, met at <HI>Stockbridge, January</HI> 4. 1758. And having heard Mr. EDWARDS'S repre&s;entation of the matter, and what his people had to &s;ay by way of objection again&s;t his removal, determined it was his duty to accept of the invitation to the pre&s;idency of the College.</P>
<P>WHEN they publi&s;hed their judgment and advice to Mr. EDWARDS and his people, he appear'd uncommonly mov'd and affected with it, and fell into tears on the occa&s;ion; which was very unu&s;ual for him, in the pre&s;ence of others: and &s;oon after &s;aid to the gentlemen, who had given their advice, that it was matter of wonder to him, that they could &s;o ea&s;ily, as they appear'd to do, get over the ob|jections he had made again&s;t his removal, to be the head of a college; which appear'd great and weighty to him But as he thought it his duty to be directed by their ad|vice, he &s;hould now endeavour chearfully to undertake it, believing he was in the way of his duty.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, having had, by the application of the Tru&s;tees of the College, the con&s;ent of the Commi&s;&s;ioners to re&s;ign their mi&s;&s;ion; he girded up his loins, and &s;et off from <HI>Stockbridge</HI> for <HI>Prince-Town</HI> in <HI>January.</HI> He left his family at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> not to be removed till Spring. He had two daughters at <HI>Prince-town,</HI> Mrs. BURR, the Widow of the late Pre&s;ident BURR, and his olde&s;t daughter that was unmarried.</P>
<P>HIS arrival at <HI>Prince-town</HI> was &s;o the great &s;atisfaction and joy of the college. And indeed all the greate&s;t friends to the college, and to the intere&s;t of religion, were highly &s;atisfied and pleas'd with the appointment of Mr. EDWARDS to the Pre&s;idency of that College, and had their hopes and expectations greatly rai&s;ed hereby. And his corre&s;pon|dents and friends, and well-wi&s;hers to the College in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> greatly approv'd of it.</P>
<P>THE Corporation met as &s;oon as could be with conve|niency, after his arrival at the College, when he was by them fixed in the pre&s;ident's chair.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="009961_0088_0F7B3F53BA99CCF0">WHILE at <HI>Prince-town,</HI> before his &s;ickne&s;s, he preachd in the College-hall from Sabbath to Sabbath, to the great acceptance of the hearers: but did nothing as pre&s;ident, unle&s;s it was to give out &s;ome que&s;tions in divinity to the &s;enior cla&s;s, to be an&s;wered before him; each one having opportunity to &s;tudy and write what he thought proper up|on them. When they came together to an&s;wer them, they found &s;o much entertainment and profit by it, e&s;pecially by the light and in&s;truction Mr. EDWARDS communicated in what he &s;aid upon the que&s;tions, when they had deli|ver'd what they had to &s;ay, that they &s;poke of it with the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction and wonder.</P>
<P>DURING this time, Mr. EDWARDS &s;eem'd to enjoy an uncommon degree of the pre&s;ence of GOD. He told his daughters, he had had great exerci&s;e, concern and fear, re|lative to his engaging in that bu&s;ine&s;s; but &s;ince it now appeared, &s;o far as he could &s;ee, that he was call'd of God to that place and work, he did cheerfully devote him&s;elf to it, leaving him&s;elf and the event with God, to order what &s;eemed to Him good.</P>
<P>THE Small-pox had now become very common in the country, and was then at <HI>Prince-town,</HI> and likely to &s;pread. And as Mr. EDWARDS had never had it, and Inoculation was then practi&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s in tho&s;e parts, he pro+po&s;ed to be inoculated, if the phy&s;ician &s;hould advi&s;e to it, and the corporation would give their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Accordingly, by the advi&s;e of the phy&s;ician, and con&s;ent of the corporation, he was inoculated <HI>February</HI> 13. He had it favourably, and it was thought all danger was over: But a &s;econdary fever &s;et in; and by rea&s;on of a number of pu&s;tles in his throat, the ob&s;truction was &s;uch, that the medicines nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tench the fever, could not be admi|ni&s;ter'd. It therefore raged till it put an end to his life on the 22d of <HI>March</HI> 1758. in the 55th Year of his Age.</P>
<P>AFTER he was &s;en&s;ible that he &s;hould not &s;urvive that &s;ickne&s;s, a little before his death, he call'd his daugh|ter to him, who attended him in his &s;ickne&s;s, and addre&s;s'd her in a few words, which were immediately taken down in writing, as near as could be recollected, and are as fol|lows,&mdash;

<HEAD>SECTION I. His MANUSCRIPTS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. EDWARDS has left a great many Volumes in manu&s;cript, which he wrote in a mi&s;cellaneous way on almo&s;t all &s;ubjects in divinity; which he did, not with any de&s;ign they &s;hould ever be publi&s;hed in the form in which they are; but for the &s;atisfaction and im|improvement of his own mind, and that he might retain the thoughts, which appear'd to him worth pre&s;erving. Some idea of the progre&s;s he had made, and the materials he had collected in this way, he gives in the foregoing let|ter
<PB N="83" REF="009961_0091_0F7B3F56060C10B0">
to the Tru&s;tees of <HI>Na&s;&s;au-Hall,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 75.</NOTE> He has wrote much on the prophecies of the MESSIAH, Ju&s;tification, the Divinity of Chri&s;t, and the eternity of Hell Torments. He wrote a great deal on the Bible, in the &s;ame way, by opening his thoughts on particular pa&s;&s;ages of it, as they occur'd to him in reading or meditation; by which he has ca&s;t much light on many parts of the bible, which has e&s;|caped other interpreters. And by which his great and painful attention to the Bible, and making it the only rule of his faith, are manife&s;t.</P>
<P>IF the publick was willing to be at the co&s;t, and pub|li&s;hing books of divinity met with as much encouragement now, as it has &s;ometimes, there might be a number of vo|lumes publi&s;hed from his manu&s;cripts, which would afford a great deal of new light and entertainment to the church of Chri&s;t: tho' they would be more imperfect, than if he him&s;elf had prepar'd them for publick view.</P>
<P>AS the method he took to have his mi&s;cellaneous wri|tings in &s;uch order, as to be able with ea&s;e to turn to any thing he had wrote upon a particular &s;ubject, when he had occa&s;ion, is perhaps as good as any, if not the be&s;t that has been propo&s;ed to the publick; &s;ome account of it will here be given, as what may be of advantage to young &s;tudents, who have not yet gone into any method, and are di&s;po&s;ed to improve their minds by writing.</P>
<P>HE <HI>numbered</HI> all his mi&s;cellaneous writings. The fir&s;t thing he wrote is No. 1. the &s;econd No. 2. and &s;o on. And when he had occa&s;ion to write on any particular &s;ub|ject, he fir&s;t &s;et down the Number, and then wrote the Subject in capitals or large character, that it might not e&s;|cape his eye, when he &s;hould have occa&s;ion to turn to it. As for in&s;tance, if he was going to write on the happine&s;s of Angels, and his la&s;t No. was 148, he would begin thus&mdash; 149. ANGELS, their HAPPINESS. &mdash; And when he had wrote what he de&s;ign'd at that time on that &s;ubject, he would turn to an alphabetical table which he kept, and under the letter A, he would write, Angels, their happine&s;s, if this was not already in his alphabet; and then &s;et down the Number, 149, clo&s;e at the right hand of it. And if he had occa&s;ion to write any new thoughts on this &s;ame &s;ubject;
<PB N="84" REF="009961_0092_0F7B3F56B6E48550">
if the Number of his mi&s;cellanies was increa&s;ed, &s;o that his la&s;t Number was 261, he would &s;et down the Number 262, and then the &s;ubject, as before. And when he had done writing for that time, he turn'd to his table, to the word Angels; and at the right hand of the Number 149, &s;et down 162. By this means he had no occa&s;ion to leave any cha&s;ms; but began his next &s;ubject where he left off his la&s;t. The number of his mi&s;cellaneous writings rang'd in this manner, amounts to above 1400. And yet by a table contain'd on a &s;heet or two of paper, any thing he wrote can be turned to, at plea&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. His PUBLICATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. EDWARDS was greatly e&s;teemed and fam'd as an AUTHOR, both in Europe and America.

His books met with a good reception in Scotland e&s;pecially, and procured him great e&s;teem and applau&s;e there. A gentleman of note there for his &s;uperior genius and talents, has the following words concerning Mr. ED|WARDS, in a letter to one of his corre&s;pondents in Ame|rica. <Q>I look'd on him as incomparably the greate&s;t divine and philo&s;opher in Britain or her Colonies; and rejoiced that one &s;o eminently qualified for teaching divi|nity was cho&s;en Pre&s;ident of New-Jer&s;ey College.</Q>

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX,</HI> N^o^. I. Containing a brief ACCOUNT of Mrs. ESTTER BURR, and &s;ome Extracts of LETTERS wrote by her.</HEAD>
<P>MRs. BURR and her children were inoculated at the &s;ame time her father was, and were recovered when he died. But after &s;he was perfectly reco|vered to all appearance, &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a violent di&s;order, which carried her out of the world in a few days: and which the phy&s;ician &s;aid he could call by no name but that of <HI>A Me&s;&s;enger &s;ent, &s;uddenly to call her out of the world.</HI> She died <HI>April</HI> 7. 1758. &s;ixteen days after her father, in the 27th year of her age. She was married to Mr. <HI>Burr,</HI> June 29. 1752. By him &s;he had two children, a &s;on and a daughter.</P>
<P>Mrs. BURR exceeded mo&s;t of her &s;ex in the beauty of her per&s;on; and in a decent and ea&s;y ge&s;ture, behaviour and conver&s;ation: not &s;tiff and &s;tarch on the one hand, nor mean and indecent on the other, in her unaffected, natural freedom with per&s;ons of all ranks, with whom &s;he conver&s;ed. Her genius was much more than common. She had a lively, &s;prightly imagination, a quick and pene|trating thought, and a good judgment. She had a pecu|liar &s;martne&s;s in her make and temper, which yet was con|&s;i&s;tent with plea&s;antne&s;s &amp; good nature: and &s;he knew how to be plea&s;ant &amp; fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ious without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the bounds of gravity, or &s;trict and &s;erious religion.

She was hopefully converted when &s;he was 7 or 8 years old; and &s;he made a publick profe&s;&s;ion of religion when &s;he was about 15 years of age; and her conver&s;ation and conduct to her death,

<P>THE following is an extract from a Letter &s;he wrote to her Mother, not long after Mr. <HI>Burr</HI>'s death, dated at <HI>Prince-ton October</HI> 7. 1757. After giving &s;ome account of Mr. <HI>Burr</HI>'s death, and repre&s;enting the &s;en&s;e &s;he had of the greatne&s;s of the lo&s;s &s;he and her children had &s;u&s;tained, &s;he writes in the following words,
<LETTER>
<P>NO doubt dear Madam, it will be &s;ome comfort to you, to hear that GOD has not utterly for&s;aken, altho' he has ca&s;t down. I would &s;peak it to the glory of God's name, that I think he has in an uncommon degree di&s;covered him&s;elf to be an all-&s;ufficient GOD, a full fountain of all good. Altho' all &s;treams were cut off, yet the fountain is left full.</P>
<P>I think I have been enabled to ca&s;t my care upon him, and have found great peace and calm in my mind, &s;uch as this world cannot give, nor take.</P>
<P>I have had uncommon freedom, a nearne&s;s to the throne of grace. GOD has &s;eemed &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y near in &s;uch a &s;upporting and comforting manner, that I think I have never experienced the like.</P>
<P>GOD has helped me to review my pa&s;t and pre&s;ent mercies, with &s;ome heart-affecting degree of thank|fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>I think GOD has given me &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the vanity of the world, and uncertainty of all &s;ublunary enjoy|ments, as I never had before. The world vani&s;hes out of my &s;ight. Heavenly and eternal things appear m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h more real and important than ever before. I feel my &s;elf to be under much greater obligations to be the Lord's, than before this &s;ore affliction.</P>
<P>THE way of &s;alvation by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t has appeared more clear and excellent; and I have been con&s;trained to venture my All upon Him; and have found great peace of &s;oul, in what I hope has been act|ings of faith.&mdash;Some parts of the P&s;alms have been very comforting and refre&s;hing to my &s;oul.</P>

<P>O dear Madam! I doubt not but I have your, and my honored father's prayers daily for me; but give me leave to intreat you both to reque&s;t earne&s;tly of the Lord, that I may never de&s;pi&s;e his cha&s;tenings, nor faint un|der this his &s;evere &s;troke; which I am &s;en&s;ible there is great danger of, if GOD &s;hould only deny me the &s;up|ports, that he has hitherto graciou&s;ly granted.</P>
<P>O, I am afraid I &s;hall conduct &s;o as to bring di&s;honor on my GOD, and the religion which I profe&s;s! &mdash; No, rather let me die this moment, than be left to bring di&s;honor on GOD's holy name. &mdash; I am overcome &mdash; I mu&s;t conclude with once more begging, that as my dear parents remember them&s;elves, they would not for|get their greatly afflicted daughter, (now a lonely widow) nor her fatherle&s;s children.</P>

<SALUTE>Honored Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR mo&s;t affectionate, comforting letter by my brother, &mdash; was exceedingly refre&s;hing to me, altho' I was &s;omething damp'd by hearing that I &s;hould not &s;ee you until &s;pring.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">When Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> wrote the Letter &s;he refers to, he did not think of going to Prince-ton till &s;pring; but he afterwards determin'd otherwi&s;e, and went in January, as is before lated.</NOTE> But 'tis my comfort in this di&s;appointment, as well as under all my afflicti|ons, that GOD knows what is be&s;t for me, and for his

own glory. Perhaps I lotted too much on the company and conver&s;ation of &s;uch a nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and dear and affectio|nate father and guide. I can't doubt but all is for the be&s;t, and I am &s;atisfied that GOD &s;hould order the affair of your removal as &s;hall be for his glory, what|ever comes of me.</P>
<P>SINCE I wrote my mother's letter, GOD has carried me thro' new trials, and given me new &s;upports. My little &s;on has been &s;ick with the &s;low fever, ever &s;ince my brother left us, and has been brought to the brink of the grave. But I hope in mercy God is bringing him up again. I was enabled to re&s;ign the child (after a &s;e|vere &s;truggle with nature) with the greatest freedom. GOD &s;hewed me that the child was not my own, but his; and that he had a right to recall what he had lent, whenever he thought fit; and I had no rea&s;on to com|plain, or &s;ay GOD was hard with me. This &s;ilenced me.</P>
<P>BUT O, how good is GOD! He not only kept me from complaining, but comforted me by enabling me to offer up the child by faith, I think, if ever I acted faith. I &s;aw the fulne&s;s there was in Chri&s;t for little Infants, and his willnigne&s;s to accept of &s;uch as were offer'd to Him. "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not;" were comforting words.</P>
<P>GOD al&s;o &s;hewed me in &s;uch a lively manner, the fullne&s;s there was in him&s;elf of all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, that I &s;aid, Altho' all &s;treams were cut off, yet &s;o long as my GOD lives, I have enough. He enabled me to &s;ay, "Altho' thou &s;lay me, yet will I tru&s;t in thee.</P>
<P>IN this time of trial, I was led to enter into a re|newed and explicit covenant with GOD, in a more &s;olemn manner than ever before; and with the greate&s;t freedom and delight. After much &s;elf-examination and prayer, I did give up my &s;elf and children to GOD, with my whole heart. Never until now, had I a &s;en&s;e of the priviledge we are allowed in covenanting with God! This act of &s;oul left my mind in a quiet and &s;teady tru&s;t in GOD.</P>
<P>A few days after this, one evening, in talking of the glorious &s;tate my dear departed hu&s;band mu&s;t be in, my &s;oul was carried out in &s;uch longing de&s;ires after this
<PB N="92" REF="009961_0100_0F7B3DDD788FB4B0">
glorious &s;tate, that I was forced to retire from the family to conceal my joy. When alone, I was &s;o tran&s;ported, and my &s;oul carried out in &s;uch eager de&s;ires after per|fection, and the full enjoyment of GOD, and to &s;erve him uninterruptedly, that I think my Nature would not have born much more. I think, dear &s;ir, I had that night, a foreta&s;te of heaven. This frame continued in &s;ome good degree the whole night. I &s;lept but little, and when I did, my dreams were all of heavenly and divine things. Frequently &s;ince, I have felt the &s;ame in kind, tho' not in degree. Thus a kind and gracious GOD has been with me in &s;ix troubles, and in &s;even.</P>
<P>BUT O Sir, what cau&s;e of deep humiliation and aba&s;e|ment of &s;oul have I, on account of remaining corruption; which I &s;ee working continually, e&s;pecially pride! O, how many &s;hapes does pride cloke it &s;elf in!</P>
<P>SATAN is al&s;o bu&s;y &s;hooting his darts; but, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, tho&s;e temptations of his, that u&s;ed to over|throw me, as yet, have not touched me. O, to be de|livered from the power of &s;atan, as well as &s;in! I can't help hoping the time is near. GOD is certainly fitting me for him&s;elf; and when I think it will be &s;oon that I &s;hall be called hence, the thought is tran&s;porting.</P>

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX,</HI> N^o^. II. Containing a &s;hort Sketch of Mrs. EDWARDS's LIFE and CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>MRs. SARAH EDWARDS, the amiable con&s;ort of pre|&s;ident EDWARDS, did not long &s;urvive him. In <HI>September</HI> &s;he &s;et out in good health on a journey to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to take care of her two orphan grand-children, which were now in that city; and had been, &s;ince the death of Mrs. <HI>Burr.</HI> As they had no relations in tho&s;e parts, Mrs. EDWARDS propo&s;ed to take them into her own family. She arived there by the way of <HI>Prince|ton</HI> Sept. 21. in good health, having had a comfortable
<PB N="93" REF="009961_0101_0F7B3DDF3003D6F0">
journey. But in a few days &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a violent dy&s;entery, which put an end to her life on the fifth day, October 2. 1758, in the 49th Year of her age. She &s;aid not much in her &s;ickne&s;s; being exerci&s;ed mo&s;t of the time with violent pain. On the morning of the day &s;he died, &s;he apprehended her death was near: when &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed her entire re&s;ignation to GOD, and de&s;ire that GOD might be glorified in all things; and that &s;he might be enabled to glorify him to the la&s;t: and continued in &s;uch a temper, calm and re&s;igned till &s;he died.</P>
<P>HER remains were carried to <HI>Princeton,</HI> which is about 40 miles from Philadelphia, and depo&s;ited with Mr. ED|WARDS's. Thus they who were in their lives remarkably lovely and plea&s;ant, in their death were not much divided. Here lie the Father and Mother, the Son and Daughter&punc; who are laid together in the grave, within the &s;pace of a little more than a year, tho' a few months before their dwelling was more than 150 miles apart. Two pre&s;idents of the &s;ame College, and their con&s;orts, than whom it will doubtle&s;s be hard to find <HI>four</HI> per&s;ons more valuable and u&s;eful; in a few months are cut off from the earth forever; and by a remarkable providence are put, as it were, into one grave! And we the &s;urvivors are left under the gloomy apprehen&s;ion that the&s;e righteous are taken away from the evil to come!</P>
<P>SURELY <HI>America</HI> is greatly emptied by the&s;e deaths! How much knowledge, wi&s;dom and holine&s;s is gone from the earth for ever! And where are they who &s;hall make good their ground!</P>
<P>Mrs. EDWARDS was born in New-Haven, in Connecticut, Jan. 9. 1709, 10. Her father was the rev. Mr. JAMES PIERPOINT, who was long an eminently godly and u&s;eful mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel at New-Haven. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">He was the elde&s;t &s;on of Mr. <HI>John Pierpoint</HI> of Roxbury, who came out of England. Her mother was Mrs <HI>Mary Pierpoint,</HI> elde&s;t daughter of the rev. Mr. <HI>Samuel Hooker,</HI> mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel at Farmington in Connecticut, and &s;on of the rev. Mr. <HI>Thomas Hooker,</HI> once mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel at Hartford, and famous as a divine, thro' all the churches in New-England.</NOTE> She was married to Mr. EDWARDS, July 20. 1727. in the 18th year of her age.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="009961_0102_0F7B3DDFE38E8618">THO' Mrs. EDWARDS's full character will not be at|tempted here, yet it is thought proper to mention a few things, in which &s;he excelled, and &s;et an example worthy the imitation of all.</P>
<P>SHE remember'd her creator in the days of her youth, and became truly and remarkably religious at about five years old. Was a more than ordinary beautiful per&s;on; of a plea&s;ant, agreable countenance; of an amiable, cour|teous conver&s;ation and behaviour: the law of kindne&s;s was in her tongue.</P>
<P>She was eminent for her piety and experimental religion. Religious conver&s;ation was much her delight; and this &s;he promoted in all companies as far as was proper and decent for her: and her di&s;cour&s;e &s;hew'd her under&s;tanding in di|vine things, and the great impre&s;&s;ion they had on her mind. The friends of true religion, and they who were ready to engage in religious conver&s;ation, and delighted in that which was mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and practical in true religion; were her peculiar friends and intimates. To whom &s;he would open her mind freely, and tell them the exerci&s;es of her own heart; and what God had done for her &s;oul, for their encouragement, and excitement in the ways of God. Her mind appear'd, to them who were mo&s;t conver&s;ant with her, con&s;tantly to attend to divine things, even on all oc|ca&s;ions, and in all bu&s;ine&s;s of life.</P>
<P>THE religious duties of the clo&s;et, &s;he was a great friend to, and took much delight in them. She highly prized &s;ocial wor&s;hip. Was wont to attend the private meet|ings for religious wor&s;hip, which were kept up at <HI>Northamp|ton,</HI> while Mr. EDWARDS lived there. And promoted and attended meetings of per&s;ons of her own &s;ects only, in order for prayer and religious conver&s;ation. She was a con&s;tant attender on publick wor&s;hip; and behaved with great gra|vity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in the hou&s;e of GOD.</P>
<P>SHE paid proper deference to Mr. EDWARDS, and treat|ed him with decency and re&s;pect at all times. As he was of a weakly, infirm con&s;titution, and was peculiar and ex|act in his diet, &s;he was a tender nur&s;e to him; chearfully attending upon him at all times, and mini&s;tring to his comfort: and &s;pared no pains to conform to his inclina|tions, and make things agreeable and comfortable to him.</P>
<P>SHE accounted it her greate&s;t glory, and that wherein &s;he could be&s;t &s;erve God and her generation, in being a
<PB N="95" REF="009961_0103_0F7B3DE082806568">
means of promoting Mr. EDWARDS's comfort and u&s;e|fulne&s;s in this way. And no per&s;on of di&s;cerning could be conver&s;ant in the family without ob&s;erving and admiring the great harmony and mutual love and e&s;teem that &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between them.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;he her &s;elf labour'd under bodily di&s;orders and pains, which was often the ca&s;e, &s;he was not wont to be full of her complaints, and put on a dejected or &s;our coun|tenance, being out of humour with every body and every thing, as if <HI>&s;he</HI> was di&s;regarged and neglected: but &s;he would bare up under them with patience, and a kind of cheerfulne&s;s and good humour.</P>
<P>SHE was a good oeconomi&s;t, managing her hou&s;hold affairs with di&s;cretion; in which &s;he was laborious and di|ligent. She was very careful that nothing &s;hould be wa&s;ted and lo&s;t. And often, when &s;he did any thing to &s;ave a &s;mall matter, or directed her children to do it in any in|&s;tance, or &s;aw them wa&s;te any thing; &s;he would mention the words of our Saviour; which, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he often tho't of, as containing a maxim worth remembering; when, as the rea&s;on why his di&s;ciples &s;hould gather up the frag|ments, he &s;ays, THAT NOTHING BE LOST. She took al|mo&s;t the whole care of the temporal affairs of the family, without doors and within: and in this &s;he was peculiarly &s;uited to Mr. EDWARDS's di&s;po&s;ition, who cho&s;e to have no care of any worldly bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>SHE had an excellent way of governing her children: &s;he knew how to make them regard and obey her cheer|fully without loud, angry words, or heavy blows. She &s;el|dom &s;trook her children a blow; and in &s;peaking to them u&s;ed mild, gentle and plea&s;ant words. If any correction was needful, it was not her manner to give it in a pa&s;&s;ion. And when &s;he had occa&s;ion to reprove and rebuke, &s;he would do it in few words, without heat and noi&s;e, with all calmne&s;s and gentlene&s;s of mind. And in her directi|ons or reproofs, in any matters of importance, &s;he would addre&s;s her&s;elf to the rea&s;on of her children, that they might not only know her inclination and will, but at the &s;ame time, be convinced of the rea&s;onablene&s;s of it. She need &s;peak but <HI>once;</HI> &s;he was chearfully obeyed; mur|muring and an&s;wering again was not known among them. And the kind &amp; gentle treatment they had from their mother, while &s;he &s;trictly &amp; punctualy maintain'd her parental au|thority,
<PB N="96" REF="009961_0104_0F7B3DE144347250">
&s;eem'd naturally to beget and promote a filial regard and re&s;pect; and lead them to a mild, tender treatment of each other; for quareling and contention, as it fre|quently takes place among children, was not known among them. She carefully ob&s;erved the fir&s;t appearances of re|&s;entment and ill-will towards any, in her young children; and did not connive at it and promote it, as many who have the care of children do, but was careful to &s;hew her di&s;plea&s;ure at it, and &s;uppre&s;s it to her utmo&s;t: not by angry, wrathful words and blows, which often provoke children to wrath, and &s;tir up and confirm their ira&s;cible pa&s;&s;ions, rather than abate and &s;uppre&s;s them.</P>
<P>AS &s;he was &s;en&s;ible that in many re&s;pects, the chief care of forming children by government and in&s;truction, na|turally lies on mothers; as they are mo&s;t with their chil|dren in their mo&s;t pliable age, when they commonly re|ceive impre&s;&s;ions by which they are very much form'd for life: &s;o &s;he was very careful to do her part in this im|portant bu&s;ine&s;s. And when &s;he met with any &s;pecial difficulty in this matter, or fore&s;aw any, &s;he was wont to apply to Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> for advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance: and on &s;uch occa&s;ions they would both attend to it, as a matter of great importance.</P>
<P>BUT this was not all, in which &s;he expre&s;s'd her care for her children. She thought that parents had great and important duty to do towards their children before they were capable of government and in&s;truction. For them &s;he con&s;tantly and earne&s;tly pray'd, and bore them on her heart before God, in all her &s;ecret and mo&s;t &s;olemn ad|dre&s;&s;es to him; and that even before they were born. The evidence of her pregnancy, and con&s;ideration that it was with a rational, immortal creature, which came into exi&s;t|ence in an undone, and infinitely dreadful &s;tate, was &s;uffi|cient to lead her to bow before God daily for his ble&s;&s;ing on it; even redemption, and eternal life by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. So that thro' all the pain, labour and &s;orrow, which at|tended her being the mother of children, &s;he was in tra|vail for them, that they might be born of GOD by having Chri&s;t formed in them.</P>
<P>AS the law of kindne&s;s was in her tongue, &s;o her hands were not withheld from beneficence and charity. She was always a friend and patrone&s;s of the poor and helple&s;s; and much in <HI>acts</HI> of charity, as well as recommending it to others on all proper occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="009961_0105_0F7B3DE1FAC8FEF8">SHE was remarkable for her kindne&s;s to her friends and vi&s;itants, who re&s;orted to Mr. EDWARDS's. She would &s;pare no pains to make them welcome, and provide for their convenience and comfort. And &s;he was peculiarly kind to &s;trangers, who came to her hou&s;e. She would take &s;uch kind and &s;pecial notice of &s;uch, and &s;o &s;oon get acquainted with them, as it were, and &s;hew &s;uch regard and concern for their comfort, and &s;o kindly offer what &s;he thought they needed, as to di&s;cover &s;he knew the heart of a &s;tranger, and well under&s;tood how to do it good; and &s;o as to oblige them to feel in &s;ome mea&s;ure as if they were at home.</P>
<P>SHE made it her rule to &s;peak well of all, &s;o far as &s;he could with truth, and ju&s;tice to her&s;elf and others. She was not wont to dwell with delight on the imperfections and failings of any; and when &s;he heard per&s;ons &s;peaking ill of others, &s;he would &s;ay what &s;he thought &s;he could with truth and ju&s;tice in their excu&s;e; or divert the oblo|quy by mentioning tho&s;e things that were commendable in them. Thus &s;he was tender of every one's character, even of theirs who injured and &s;poke evil of her; and care|fully guarded again&s;t the too common vice of evil &s;peaking and backbiting. She could bear injuries and reproach with great calmne&s;s &amp; patience, without any di&s;po&s;ition to render evil for evil; but on the contrary, was ready to pity and forgive tho&s;e who appear'd to be her enemies.</P>
<P>SHE had long told her intimate friends that &s;he had, af|ter long &s;truggles and exerci&s;es, obtain'd, by God's grace, an habitual willingne&s;s to die her &s;elf, or part with any of her mo&s;t near relatives. That &s;he was willing to bring forth children for death; and re&s;ign up him whom &s;he e&s;teemed &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing to her &amp; her family, her neare&s;t partner, to the &s;troke of death, whenever GOD &s;hould &s;ee fit to take him. And when &s;he had the greate&s;t trial in the death of Mr. EDWARDS, &s;he found the help and comfort of &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition. Her conver&s;ation and con|duct on this occa&s;ion was even to the admiration of her friends. It was &s;uch as di&s;cover'd that &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of the great lo&s;s, &s;he and her children had &s;u&s;tain'd in his death; and at the &s;ame time &s;hewed, that &s;he was quiet and re&s;igned, and had tho&s;e invi&s;ible &s;upports and comforts by which &s;he could tru&s;t in GOD with quietne&s;s, hope and humble joy.</P>

<P>SERMONS ON Various important SUBJECTS. Being &s;ome of the Remains of the late Reverend and Learned Mr. <HI>JONATHAN EDWARDS,</HI> PRESIDENT of the COLLEGE at NEW-JERSEY.</P>
<P><HI>BOSTON:</HI> Printed and Sold by S. KNEELAND, in Queen-Street. M,DCC,LXV.</P>

<PB REF="009961_0108_0F7B3DE4776E27B0">
<HEAD>The PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>_SUCH was the true character of the pious &amp; learned author of the en&s;uing Sermons, as that the lovers of pure religion, and unaffected learning, who were intimately acquainted with him, and free from prejudice, need nothing further to invite their atten|tive peru&s;al of the following &s;heets, than only to be informed that they were written by the late PRE|SIDENT <HI>EDWARDS.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Sermons indeed appear under con&s;iderable di&s;advantages: The author compo&s;ed them only to be preach'd to a congregation in a country-town, where he &s;tatedly labour'd in the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;|try, for a cour&s;e of years, probably without the lea&s;t de&s;ign, or &s;o much as even any di&s;tant view of their ever making an appearance, by way of the pre&s;s, be|fore the world. For this, the candid will make a generous allowance.</P>
<P><PB REF="009961_0109_0F7B3DE4F991A008">IF the author had publi&s;hed them him&s;elf, or had revi&s;ed them near the clo&s;e of his life, with a view to their public appearance, 'tis not at all likely they would have appeared as they do at pre&s;ent; but the difference in &s;ome re&s;pects at lea&s;t, mu&s;t have been con&s;iderable. In &s;everal places, inlargements would have been made; various parts would have been brightned with new illu&s;trations; the &s;tile in a number of in&s;tances would have been alter'd, and the dre&s;s made more agreable. And, in a word, the whole, taken together, would have appear'd in a much more advantageous light, more in&s;tructive, and entertaining.</P>
<P>This might have been rea&s;onably expected, from the author's ma&s;terly and di&s;tingui&s;hed genius, which prompted him eagerly to pur&s;ue truth, even in her mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es. E&s;pecially, if it be con&s;idered, that the greater part of the&s;e Sermons were penn'd more than twenty years before his death, in which &s;pace of time, he made &s;wift &amp; amazing advances in divine knowledge, in branches almo&s;t numberle&s;s. The &s;ame thing may be inferr'd from the author's manner: Some Sermons, that he formerly publi&s;hed, received
<PB REF="009961_0110_0F7B3DE6D4DA12E0">
great enlargements under his la&s;t and fini&s;hing hand; and howev'r engaging and entertaining they were in the delivery, they appear'd much ampler from the pre&s;s, than the pulpit.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, 'tis &s;ome unhappine&s;s, thro' a mi&s;take, the &s;ubjects are not placed in that natural and advantageous order, which was de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, under all their di&s;advantages, the Ser|mons, 'tis apprehended, will be well receiv'd by the candid, intelligent chri&s;tian reader: And that every per&s;on that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a happy degree of &s;ound judgment, and good ta&s;te, who &s;hall &s;eriou&s;ly peru&s;e them, will find that ju&s;tne&s;s and clearne&s;s of thought; that natural &amp; lively repre&s;entation of divine things; that vein of piety and &s;olid religion running through the whole; that exten&s;ive knowledge, that command|ing pungency, and &s;piritual &s;avor, which may &s;erve in a mea&s;ure to point out the author, and at the &s;ame time, to in&s;truct, entertain and quicken the reader.</P>
<P>The public may be a&s;&s;ured that the Sermons are faithfully copied from the original manu&s;cripts. And where &s;entences, or paragraphs were found unfini&s;h|ed,
<PB REF="009961_0111_0F7B3DE76DE66590">
as there were various &s;uch in&s;tances, in mo&s;t of the Sermons, mark'd with a &s;troke of the pen, thus &mdash;which the author u&s;ed to &s;upply in the delivery,&mdash;the editor has not taken the liberty to compleat them, except an in&s;tance or two, in the Sermons <HI>upon the wi&s;dom of God</HI>&mdash;where the words added, are carefully included in crotchets. Wherever therefore, the reader finds &s;uch a &s;troke&mdash; he is hereby notified, that &s;omething is left unex|pre&s;s'd, which his own mind is to &s;upply.</P>
<P>The date, at the beginning of the Sermons, marks the time when they were compo&s;ed and preach'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e Sermons being &s;ome of the remains of an eminent man of God, &amp;, friend to men, are heartily recommended to the candid acceptance, and faithful improvement of all into who&s;e hands they may fall; and to the ble&s;&s;ing of him who is ALL and IN ALL, the great di&s;po&s;er of all events, who was plea&s;ed &s;ignally to di&s;tingui&s;h his &s;ervant, when li|ving, with gifts and graces, and to crown his la|bours with unu&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Apo&s;tle in this Chapter does par|ticularly oppo&s;e &s;ome among the chri&s;tian Corinthians, who denied the Re&s;urrection of the Dead, and much mole&s;ted and infected the Church of Corinth with their Doctrine. There were two &s;orts of Per&s;ons in that Age, who were e&s;pe|cially great Oppo&s;ers of the Doctrine of the Re&s;ur|rection: one among the Jews, and the other among the Heathen Tho&s;e among the Jews were the Sad|ducees; of whom we read, Acts xxiii. 8 <HI>For the Sad|ducees &s;ay, that there is no Re&s;urrection, neither An|gel nor Spirit.</HI> And we have the &s;ame Account in other Places. Tho&s;e among the Heathen that were
<PB N="2" REF="009961_0115_0F7B3DEA495D00D0" MS="y">
the chief Oppo&s;ers of this Doctrine, were their Phi|lo&s;ophers. The Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection of the Dead, was not con&s;i&s;tent with their Philo&s;ophy, by the Principles of which, it was impo&s;&s;ible that one who was deprived of the Habit of Life, &s;hould ever receive it again. And therefore they ridiculed the Doctrine when the Apo&s;tle preached it among them at Athens. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii.</NOTE> It probably was chiefly from the&s;e latter that the Church at Corinth received this Corruption, the Philo&s;ophers, and not the Sadducees. For Corinth was near to Athens, which was the Place of the chief Re&s;ort of the Philo|phers of all the Cities of that learned Country of Greece.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle in oppo&s;ing this Error, fir&s;t in&s;i&s;ts on Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection from the Dead; and next on the Re&s;urrection of all the Saints at the end of the World. And in the Ver&s;es next before the Text, &s;hews how both are connected, or that one ari&s;es or follows from the other. And then adds, <HI>Then cometh the End, when he &s;hall have delivered up the Kingdom to God even the Father, when he &s;hall have put down all Rule, and all Authority, &amp; Power. For he mu&s;t reign till he hath put all Enemies under his Feet. The la&s;t Enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed is Death.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve the&s;e two Things in the Words of the Text.</P>
<P N="1">1. HERE is &s;omething mentioned, as one Thing wherein appears the Glory of that Exaltation and Do|minion, that Chri&s;t has as our Redeemer, viz. that it i&s;&s;ues in the Subjection of all Enemies under his Feet. It is not &s;aid all <HI>his</HI> Enemies, po&s;&s;ibly becau&s;e tho&s;e that &s;hall be put under his Feet, are not only his Ene|mies; but al&s;o the Enemies of his Father, and of his People. Their being under his Feet denotes their be|ing perfectly vanqui&s;hed and &s;ubdued, and brought ex|ceeding low under him, and his being gloriou&s;ly exalt|ed over them. It &s;hall be thus with re&s;pect to God's,
<PB N="3" REF="009961_0116_0F7B3DEB185D26F0" MS="y">
and his, and his People's Enemies univer&s;ally, not one excepted: Which Univer&s;allity is &s;ignified here two Ways. (1.) In the univer&s;al Terms that are u&s;ed <HI>All</HI> Enemies. (2.) In that here is an Account of the &s;ubject|ing of the <HI>very la&s;t</HI> Enemy: When there &s;hall be <HI>but one</HI> Enemy left, that &s;hall al&s;o be put under his Feet.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE may learn what is here meant by Enemies, by the particular In&s;tance here given by the la&s;t that &s;hall be de&s;troyed, viz. Death. Which &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ws that by Enemies, is not only meant Per&s;ons that &s;et them&s;elves in Oppo&s;ition to God and his People; but <HI>Evils;</HI> whatever is any Way again&s;t God and his People, and does oppo&s;e or mole&s;t Chri&s;t or his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aints, are here called Enemies, whether they be Per&s;ons or Things.</P>
<P>Hence the</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE. Our LORD JESUS CHRIST, in the Work of Redemption, gloriou&s;ly appears above all Evil.</HEAD>
<P>IN handling this Doctrine, I propo&s;e to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="1">I. How Evil of all Kinds has prevailed, and highly exalted it&s;elf in the World.</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT tho' Evil has &s;o greatly prevailed, and how high &s;oever it has exalted it&s;elf, Chri&s;t appears gloriou&s;ly above it, in the Work of Redemption.</P>
<P N="1">I. EVIL of all Kinds has ri&s;en to an exceeding height in the World, and highly exalted it&s;elf again&s;t God and Chri&s;t, and the Church.</P>
<P>This will appear by the following Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. SATAN has highly exalted him&s;elf, and greatly prevailed. Satan is one who is va&s;tly &s;uperior, in his n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tural Capacity and Abilities, to Mankind. He was originally one of the highe&s;t Rank of Creatures, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing
<PB N="4" REF="009961_0117_0F7B3DEBCF8F3720">
a mighty Angel. He proudly exalted him&s;elf in Re|bellion again&s;t God in Heaven. For we are told that Pride was the Condemnation of the Devil.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iii. 6.</NOTE> He be|came proud of his own &s;uperior Dignity and mighty Abilities, and the Glory which his Creator had put up|on him; and probably thought it too much to &s;ubmit to the Son of God, and attempted to exalt his Throne above the Throne of Chri&s;t. And he prevailed to draw away va&s;t Multitudes, many Thou&s;ands and Millions of the heavenly Ho&s;ts, into an open Rebellion again&s;t God.</P>
<P>AND after he was ca&s;t down from Heaven, he proudly exalted him&s;elf in this World, and prevailed to do great Things here. By his &s;ubtil Temptations he p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ocur'd the fall of our fir&s;t Parents, and &s;o brought about the Ruin of the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le Race of Mankind. He procured their Ruin in Body and Soul, and the Death of both; and that they &s;hould be expo&s;ed to all Manner of Calamity in this World, and to eternal Ruin here|after. He &s;o far prevailed, that he drew Men off from the Service of their Maker, and &s;et up him&s;elf to be the God of this World; and in a little Time drew the World into that almo&s;t univer&s;al Corruption, which brought on the Flood of Waters, by which it was de|&s;troyed. And after that, he again in a little Time drew all Nations, except the Po&s;terity of Jacob, off from the Wor&s;hip of the true God, and darkened all the World with the darkne&s;s of Heatheni&s;m; and held them un|der this Darkne&s;s for a great many Ages: he him&s;elf being wor&s;hiped as God almo&s;t all over the World: the Nations of the Earth offered Sacrifices to him; and Multitudes offered up their Children in Sacrifice to him. And during that Time, he often &s;o far prevailed again&s;t the People of God, that he had almo&s;t &s;wallowed them up The Church was often brought to the very Brink of Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="009961_0118_0F7B3DEC79FB6628">AND when Chri&s;t him&s;elf appeared in the World, how did he exalt him&s;elf again&s;t him! and prevailed &s;o far, as to influence Men to hate and de&s;pi&s;e him all the Days of his Life. And at la&s;t per&s;waded one of his own Di&s;ciples to betray him; and brought it to pa&s;s, that he was delivere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> into the Hands of Men, to be mocked, buffeted and &s;pit upon, and treated with the greate&s;t ignominy that unre&s;trained Malice could de|vi&s;e: and at la&s;t procured that he &s;hould be put to the mo&s;t cruel, ignominious kind of Death that was in u&s;e in the World. And &s;ince that, he has greatly exalted him&s;elf again&s;t the Go&s;pel and Kingdom of Chri&s;t: has procured that the Church, for the mo&s;t Part, has been the Subject of great Per&s;ecution; has often bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t it to the brink of utter De&s;truction: Has accompli&s;h|ed great Works in &s;etting up tho&s;e great Kingdoms of Antichri&s;t and Mahomet; and darkened great Part of the World, that was once enlightened with the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t with wor&s;e than heathen Darkne&s;s. And has infected the chri&s;tian World with Multitudes of Here&s;ies and fal&s;e Ways of Wor&s;hip, and greatly pro|moted Athei&s;m and Infidelity. Thus highly has the Devil exalted him&s;elf again&s;t God and Chri&s;t, and the Elect; and &s;o far has he prevailed.</P>
<P N="2">2. GUILT is another Evil which has come to a great height in the World. All Guilt is an Evil of a dread|ful Nature: the lea&s;t Degree of it is enough utterly to undo any Creature. It is a Thing that reaches un|to Heaven, and cries to God, and brings down his Wrath. The guilt of any one Sin is &s;o terrible an Evil, that it prevails to bind over the guilty Per&s;on to &s;uffer everla&s;ting Burnings: and &s;o is an Evil that is in &s;ome Re&s;pect infinite, in that it obliges to that Pu|ni&s;hment which has no end; and &s;o is infinitely terrible. But this kind of Evil has ri&s;en to a mo&s;t amazing height in this World; where not only &s;ome Per&s;ons are guilty, but all in all Nations and Ages are naturally
<PB N="6" REF="009961_0119_0F7B3DEE8959EFA8">
guilty Wretches. And they who live to act any time in the World, are not only guilty of <HI>one</HI> Sin, but of Thou&s;ands, and thou&s;ands of Thou&s;ands. What mul|tiplied, and what aggravated Sins are &s;ome Men guilty of! What Guilt lies on &s;ome particular Per&s;ons! how much more on &s;ome particular populous Ci|ties! How much more &s;till on this wicked World! How much does the Guilt of the World tran&s;cend all Account; all Expre&s;&s;ion; all Powers of Numbers or Mea&s;ures! And above all&punc; how va&s;t is the Guilt of the World, in all Ages of it, from the beginning of the World to the end of it! To what a Pitch has Guilt ri&s;en in the World; The World being, as it were, on every Side, loaded with it, as with Mountains heaped on Mountains above the Clouds and Stars of Heaven.</P>
<P>AND Guilt, when it was imputed to Chri&s;t, greatly prevailed again&s;t him; tho' in him&s;elf innocent, and the eternal Son of God; even &s;o as to hold him Pri|&s;oner of Ju&s;tice for a while; and to open the Flood|gates of God's Wrath upon him, and bring all his Waves and Billows over him.</P>
<P N="3">3. CORRUPTION and Wickedne&s;s of Heart, is another Thing that has ri&s;en to an exceeding height in the World. Sin has &s;o far prevailed in the World, that it has become univer&s;al: All Mankind that are meer Men, are become &s;inful and corrupt Creatures. Let us attend to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s De&s;cription of the World. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom iii. 9&mdash; 18.</NOTE> <HI>Jews and Gentiles are all under Sin. As it is writ|ten. There is none Righteous, no not one: there is none that under&s;tandeth, there is none that &s;eeketh after God. They are all gone out of the Way, they are together become unprofitable, there is none that doth Good, no not one.</HI> And not only is <HI>every one</HI> cor|rupt; but they are <HI>all over</HI> corrupt, in every Power, Faculty &amp; Principle; every Part is depraved. Which is here repre&s;ented by the &s;everal Parts of the Body being corrupt, as the Throat, the Tongue, the Lips,

<P>IT was not the Will of the infinitly wi&s;e and holy Governor of the World, that Things &s;hould remain in this Confu&s;ion; thus under the Reign of Evil, which had prevailed and exalted it &s;elf to &s;uch an Height.

<P N="1">1.

The Evils which have been &s;poken of, never &s;eemed &s;o to prevail again&s;t him as in the&s;e Suffer|ings: But <HI>in them,</HI> the Foundation was laid for their overthrow. <HI>In them</HI> he appeared above Satan.

He &s;lew Satan, as it were, with his own Wea|pon: The &s;piritual <HI>David</HI> cut off this Goliath's Head with his own Sword; and he triumphed over him in his Cro&s;s.

But &s;o did the Wi&s;dom of Chri&s;t order Things, that Satan's Subtilty and Malice, &s;hould be made the very Means of undermining the Foundations of his King|dom: and &s;o he wi&s;ely led him into the Pit that he had digged.</P>
<P>IN this al&s;o Chri&s;t appeared gloriou&s;ly above the Guilt of Men. For he offered that Sacrifice, that was

&s;ufficient to do away all the Guilt of the whole World. Tho' the Guilt of Man was like the great Mountains, who&s;e Heads are lifted up to the Heavens; yet his dying Love, and his Merits in this, appeared as a mighty Deluge that over-flowed the highe&s;t Mountains; or like a boundle&s;s Ocean that &s;wallows them up: or like an immen&s;e Fountain of Light, that with the fulne&s;s and redundance of its Brightne&s;s, &s;wallows up Men's greate&s;t Sins, as little Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es are &s;wallowed up and hid|den in the Di&s;k of the Sun.</P>

<P>IN this Work the Grace of Chri&s;t does gloriou&s;ly triumph over Mens Guilt. He comes over the Moun|tains of their Sins and vi&s;its them with his Salvation.</P>

<P>My Subject has led me to &s;uch a length in the doctri|nal part, I have room left but ju&s;t, as it were, to hint at two or three, of the many U&s;es, that may be copi|ou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on from it.</P>
<P N="1">1. In this we may &s;ee how the Glory of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t appears in the Work of Redemption. It was becau&s;e the Father had from Eternity a De&s;ign of exceedingly glorifying his Son, that he appointed him to be the Per&s;on, that &s;hould thus triumph over the Evil in the World. The Work of Redemption is the mo&s;t glorious of all the Works of God that are made known to us. The Glory of God does mo&s;t remarkably &s;hine forth in it. And this is one thing wherein the Glory of it does eminently appear, that therein Chri&s;t appears &s;o gloriou&s;ly exalted above Satan &amp; all his In|&s;truments; above all Guilt, all Corruption, all Af|fliction, and above Death; above <HI>all</HI> Evil. And more e&s;pecially, becau&s;e Evil hath &s;o exalted it&s;elf in the
<PB N="20" REF="009961_0133_0F7B3DF8A96778D8">
World, as we have heard; and exalted it&s;elf again&s;t CHRIST in particular.</P>
<P>SATAN has ever had a peculiar Enmity again&s;t the Son of God. Probably his fir&s;t Rebellion, which was his Condemnation, was his proudly taking it in Di&s;dain, when God declared the Decree in Heaven, that his Son in Man's Naure, &s;hould be the King of Heaven; and that all the Angels &s;hould wor&s;hip him. However that was, yet it is certain that his Strife has ever been e&s;pecially again&s;t the Son of God. The Enmity has always been between the Seed of the Woman, and the Serpent. And therefore that War which the Devil maintains again&s;t God, is repre&s;ented by the Devil and his Angel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fighting again&s;t Michael and his Angels. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xii. 7.</NOTE> This Michael is Chri&s;t. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dan. x. 21. &amp; xii. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>GOD had appointed his Son to be the Heir of the World; but the Devil has conte&s;ted this Matter with him, and has &s;trove to &s;et him&s;elf up as God of the World, in oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t. And how exceedingly has the Devil exalted him&s;elf again&s;t Chri&s;t! How did he oppo&s;e him as he dwelt among the Jews, in his Tabernacle and Temple! And how did he oppo&s;e him when on Earth! And how has he oppo&s;ed him &s;ince his A&s;cen&s;ion! What great and mighty Works has Satan brought to pa&s;s in the World; how many Babels has he built up to Heaven, in his oppo&s;ition to the Son of God! How exceeding proud and haughty has he appeared in his Oppo&s;ition! How has he and his In&s;truments, and that Sin and Affliction and Death that he is the Father of, raged again&s;t Chri&s;t! But yet Chri&s;t in the Work of Redemption appears infinitely above them all. In this Work he triumphs over them, however they have dealt proudly; and they all ap|pear under his Feet. In this the Glory of the Son of God in the Work of Redemption, remarkably ap|pears.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="009961_0134_0F7B3DF94375D188" MS="y">THE Beauty of Good appears with greate&s;t Advan|tage, when compar'd with it's contrary Evil. And the Glory of that which is excellent, then e&s;pecially &s;hews it &s;elf, when it triumphs over it's contrary, and appears va&s;tly above it, in it's greate&s;t Height.</P>
<P>THE Glory of Chri&s;t in this glorious Exaltation over &s;o great Evil, that has &s;o exalted it's &s;elf again&s;t him, does the more remarkably appear, in that he is thus exalted out of &s;o low a State. Tho' he appeared in the World, as it were a little Child; yet how does this Child of God triumph over the mo&s;t gigantick Enemies of God and Men! He who was "a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief," is a Man of War, and triumphed over his Enemies in all their Power. He who was meek and lowly of Heart, has triumphed over tho&s;e <HI>proud</HI> Foes. And he is exalted over them all, in that which appears mo&s;t de&s;picable, even his CROSS.</P>

<P>HOW high &s;oever their Guilt has ri&s;en, tho' Moun|tains have been heaping on Mountains all the Days of their Lives, till the Pile appears towering up to Hea|ven, and above the very Stars; yet Chri&s;t in the Work of Redemption appears gloriou&s;ly exalted above all this Height.</P>
<P>THO' they are overwhelmed in a mighty Deluge of Woe and Mi&s;ery; a Deluge that is not only above their Heads, but above the Heads of the highe&s;t Moun|tains; and they don't &s;ee how it is po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould e&s;cape; y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they have no Rea&s;on to be di&s;cou|raged from looking to Chri&s;t for help; who in the Work of Redemption, appears gloriou&s;ly above the Deluge of Evil.</P>

<P>IF they apprehend them&s;elves to be mi&s;erable Cap|tives of Satan; and find him too &s;trong an Adver&s;ary for them; and the Devil is often tempting them, and buffeting them, and triumphing over them with great cruelty. If it &s;eems to them that the Devil has &s;wal|lowed them up, and has got full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, as the Whale had of <HI>Jonah;</HI> yet there is Encouragement for them to look again, as <HI>Jonah</HI> did, towards God's holy Temple, and to tru&s;t in Chri&s;t for Deliverance from Satan, who appears &s;o gloriou&s;ly exalted above him in the Work of Redemption.</P>
<P>IF they are ready to &s;ink with that Darkne&s;s and tho&s;e Sorrows which they meet with; that Di&s;tre&s;s of Con&s;cience, or tho&s;e Frowns of God upon them; &s;o that God's Waves and Billows &s;eem to pa&s;s over them; yet they have Encouragement enough to look to Chri&s;t for Deliverance.

<P>_WE have an account here and in the Con|text, of that remarkable Behaviour of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Potiphar,</HI> that was the Occa&s;ion, both of his great Affliction, and al&s;o afterwards of his high Advancement and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat Pro&s;perity in the Land of E|gypt. The Behaviour that I &s;peak of, is that which was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Occa&s;ion of the Temptation that his Mi&s;tre&s;s laid before him to commit <HI>Uncleanne&s;s</HI> with her.</P>
<P>WE read in the beginning of the Chapter, how <HI>Jo|&s;eph</HI> after he had been &s;o cruelly treated by his Bre|thren, and &s;old into Egypt for a Slave, was advanced in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Potiphar,</HI> who had bought him. <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was one that feared GOD, and therefore GOD was with him; and wonderfully ordered Things for
<PB N="25" REF="009961_0138_0F7B3DFC3837C8E0">
him, and &s;o influenced the Heart of <HI>Potiphar</HI> his Ma&s;ter, that in&s;tead of keeping him as a meer Slave, to which Purpo&s;e he was &s;old, he made him his Ste|ward and Over&s;eer over his Hou&s;e, and all that he had was put into his Hands: in &s;o much, that we are told, &vers;. 6. <HI>that he left all that he had in his Hand; and that he knew not ought that he had, &s;ave the Bread which he did eat.</HI>&mdash; While <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was in the&s;e pro&s;|perous Circum&s;tances, he met with a <HI>great</HI> Tempta|tion in his Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e: &s;o we are told, that he being a <HI>goodly Per&s;on, and well favoured,</HI> his Mi&s;tre&s;s ca&s;t her Eyes upon and lu&s;ted after him, and u&s;ed all her Art to tempt him to commit <HI>Uncleanne&s;s</HI> with her.</P>
<P>Concerning this Temptation, and his Behaviour un|der it, many Things are worthy to be noted.</P>
<P>WE may ob&s;erve, how great the Temptation was, that he was under. It is to be con&s;idered, <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was now in his <HI>Youth:</HI> a Sea&s;on of Life, when Per&s;ons are mo&s;t liable to be overcome by Temptations of this Nature. And he was in a State of unexpected Pro&s;|perity in <HI>Potiphar's</HI> Hou&s;e; which has a tendency to lift Per&s;ons up, e&s;pecially young Ones, whereby com|monly they more ea&s;ily fall before Temptations.</P>
<P>AND then, the <HI>Superiority</HI> of the Per&s;on that laid the Temptation before him, render'd it <HI>much</HI> the greater. She was his <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> and he a <HI>Servant under her.</HI> And the <HI>Manner</HI> of her tempting him. She did not only carry her &s;elf &s;o to <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> as gave him Cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect that he might be admitted to &s;uch cri|minal Conver&s;e with her, that yet might be accompa|nied with &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion, that po&s;&s;ibly he might be mi&s;taken, and &s;o deter him from adventuring on &s;uch a Propo&s;al; but &s;he directly propos'd it to him; plain|ly manife&s;ting her Di&s;po&s;ition to <HI>it.</HI> So that here was no &s;uch Thing as a Su&s;picion of her unwillingne&s;s to deter him, but a Manife&s;tation of her de&s;ire to entice him to <HI>it.</HI> Yea, &s;he appear'd <HI>greatly engag'd</HI> in the
<PB N="26" REF="009961_0139_0F7B3DFE205BEF80">
Matter. And there was not only her De&s;ire manife&s;ted to entice him, but her <HI>Authority</HI> over him to enforce the Temptation. She was his <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> and he might well imagine, that if he utterly refus'd a Compliance, he &s;hould incur her Di&s;plea&s;ure: and &s;he, being his <HI>Ma&s;ter's</HI> Wife, had Power to do much to his di&s;ad|vantage, and to render his Circum&s;tances more un|comfortable in the Family.</P>
<P>AND the Temptation was the greater, in that &s;he did not only tempt him once, but frequently, <HI>Day by Day,</HI> &vers;. 10. And at la&s;t became more violent with him. &mdash; She caught him by his Garment, &s;aying, <HI>Lie with me:</HI> as in the Ver. of the Text.</P>
<P>HIS Behaviour was very remarkable under the&s;e Temptations. He ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed any Compliance with them: he made no Reply that manife&s;ted as tho' the Temptation had gained at all upon him; &s;o much as to he&s;itate about it, or at all to deliberate upon it. He complied in no Degree, either to the gro&s;s Act, &s;he propo&s;ed, or any thing tending towards it, or that &s;hould in a le&s;&s;er Degree be gratifying to her wicked Inclina|tion. And he per&s;i&s;ted <HI>re&s;olute</HI> and <HI>un&s;haken</HI> under her continual Sollicitations&punc; &vers;. 10. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s as &s;he &s;pake to Jo&s;eph Day by Day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</HI> He to his utmo&s;t avoided &s;o much as being where &s;he was. And the Motives and Principles, from which he acted, manife&s;ted by his Reply to her Sollicitations, are remarkable.</P>
<P>HE fir&s;t &s;ets before her, how injuriou&s;ly he &s;hould act again&s;t his Ma&s;ter, if he &s;hould comply with her Propo&s;al: <HI>Behold my Ma&s;ter &mdash; hath committed all that he hath to my Hand; there is none greater in this Hou&s;e than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me, but thee, becau&s;e thou art his Wife.</HI> But h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> then proceeded to inform her of that, which above all things, deter'd him from a Compliance, viz.

that it would be great Wickedne&s;s, and Sin again&s;t GOD.&mdash;<HI>How &s;hall I do this, and &s;in again&s;t GOD!</HI> He would not do any &s;uch thing, as he would not injure his Ma&s;ter; but that which influenced more than <HI>all</HI> on this Occa&s;ion, was the fear of &s;inning again&s;t GOD. On this Account he per&s;i&s;ted in his Re&s;olu|tion to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>IN the Text we have an Account of his Behaviour under the la&s;t and greate&s;t Temptation that he had from her. This Temptation was great, as we are told it was at a Time when there was no Body in the Hou&s;e, but he and his Mi&s;tre&s;s, &vers;. 11. there was an Opportu|nity to commit the Fact with the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy. And at this Time it &s;eems that &s;he was more violent than ever before. She caught him by the Garment &amp;c. She laid hold on him, as tho' &s;he were re&s;olute to at|tain her Purpo&s;e of him.</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e Circum&s;tances he not only refu&s;ed her, but fled from her&punc; as he would have done from one that was going to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate, or murder him; he e&s;cap'd, as for his Life. He not only would not be guilty of &s;uch a Fact, but neither would he by any Means be in the Hou&s;e with her, where he &s;hould be in the Way of her Temptation.</P>

her, or be <HI>with</HI> her. And in the Text we are told, <HI>He fled, and got him out;</HI> would by no Means be in her Company. Tho' it was no Sin, in it &s;elf, for <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> to be in the Hou&s;e where his Mi&s;tre&s;s was; but under the&s;e Circum&s;tances it would expo&s;e him to Sin. <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was &s;en&s;ible he had <HI>naturally</HI> a corrupt Heart, that tended to betray him to Sin; and therefore he would by no Means be in the <HI>Way</HI> of Temptation; but with ha&s;te he fled, he run from the dangerous Place. In as much as he was expos'd to <HI>Sin</HI> in that Hou&s;e where he was, he fled out of it with as much ha&s;te as if the Hou&s;e had been <HI>all of a light Fire;</HI> or full of Enemies, who &s;tood ready with drawn Swords, to <HI>&s;tab</HI> him to the very Heart. When &s;he took him by the <HI>Garment,</HI> he <HI>left</HI> his Garment in her Hands: he had rather <HI>lo&s;e</HI> his Garment, than &s;tay a Moment there, <HI>where</HI> he was in &s;uch Danger of <HI>lo&s;ing</HI> his CHASTITY.</P>
<P>I &s;ay in the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> that Per&s;ons &s;hould avoid things that expo&s;e to <HI>Sin, as far as may be,</HI> becau&s;e the Ca&s;e may be &s;o, that Per&s;ons may be called to ex|po&s;e them&s;elves to Temptation; and when it is &s;o, they may hope for <HI>divine</HI> Strength and Protection under Temptation.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e may be &s;o, that it may be a Man's in|di&s;pen&s;able Duty to undertake an Office, or Piece of Work, that is attended with a great deal of Tempta|tion. Thus, altho' ordinarily a Man ought not to run into that Temptation, of being expo&s;ed to Per&s;ecution for the true Religion; le&s;t the Temptation &s;hould be too hard for him; but &s;hould avoid it, as much as <HI>may be;</HI> (Therefore CHRIST thus directs his Di&s;ciples, Mat. x. 23. <HI>When ye be per&s;ecuted in one City, flee to another.</HI>) Yet, the Ca&s;e may be &s;o, that a Man may be called not to flee from Per&s;ecution; but to run the venture of &s;uch a trial, tru&s;ting in GOD to uphold him under it. Mini&s;ters and Magi&s;trates may be obliged to continue with their People in &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances;

as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> &s;ays, Neh. vi. 11.&mdash;<HI>Should &s;uch a Man as I flee?</HI> So the <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Yea they may be called to go into the mid&s;t of it; to tho&s;e Places, where they can't rea&s;onably expect but to meet with &s;uch Temptations. So &s;ometimes the Apo&s;tles did. <HI>Paul</HI> went up to Jeru&s;alem, when he knew before hand, that <HI>there, Bonds and Afflictions awaited him,</HI> Acts xx. 23.</P>
<P>SO in &s;ome other Ca&s;es, the Nece&s;&s;ity of Affairs may call upon Men to engage in &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s that is peculiarly attended with Temptations. But when it is &s;o, Men are indeed in this Way, lea&s;t expos'd to <HI>Sin;</HI> for they are always &s;afe&s;t in the Way of Duty. Prov. x. 9. <HI>He that walketh uprightly, walketh &s;urely.</HI> And the' there be many Things by which they may have extraordinary Temptations, in the Affairs they have undertaken, yet if they have a clear Call to it, it is no Pre&s;umption to hope for divine Support and Pre|&s;ervation in it.</P>
<P>BUT for Per&s;ons needle&s;ly to expo&s;e them&s;elves to Temptation, and to do tho&s;e Things that tend to Sin, is unwarrantable; and contrary to that excellent Ex|ample, we have &s;et before us in the Text.

<P N="1">I. <HI>IT is a Thing very evident and manife&s;t, that we ought to u&s;e our utmo&s;t Endeavours to avoid Sin: which is incon&s;i&s;tent with needle&s;ly doing tho&s;e Things, that expo&s;e and lead to Sin.</HI> That we ought to do our utmo&s;t to avoid Sin is manife&s;t, that being the greate&s;t <HI>Evil:</HI> And the greater any Evil is, the greater Care, and the more earne&s;t Endeavours does it require to avoid it. This is plain, and what we by our practice &s;hew that we are all &s;en&s;ible of the truth of.

<P>SIN is an infinite Evil, becau&s;e committed again&s;t an infinitely great and excellent BEING, and &s;o a Vio|lation of infinite Obligation: Therefore however great our Care be to avoid <HI>Sin,</HI> it cannot be more than proportionable to the Evil we would avoid. Our care and endeavour cannot be infinite, as the Evil of <HI>Sin</HI> is infinite; but yet it ought to be to the utmo&s;t of our Power; we ought to u&s;e every Method that tends to tho avoiding of Sin. This is manife&s;t to Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>AND not only &s;o, but this is po&s;itively required of us in the Word of GOD. Jo&s;h. xxii. 5. <HI>Take dili|gent heed to do the Commandment and the Law, which</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>the Servant of the LORD charged you, to love the Lord your GOD, and to walk in all his Ways, and to keep his Commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to &s;erve him with all your Soul.</HI> Deut. iv. 15, 16. <HI>Take ye therefore g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od heed unto your &s;elves, le&s;t ye corrupt your &s;elves.</HI> Chap. xii. 30. <HI>Take heed to thy &s;elf, that thou be not &s;nared, &amp;c.</HI> Luk. xi. 36. <HI>Take heed and beware of Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> 1 Cor. x. 12. <HI>Let him that thinketh he &s;tandeth, take heed le&s;t he fall.</HI> Deut. iv. 9. <HI>Take heed to thy &s;elf, keep thy Soul diligently.</HI> The&s;e and many other Texts of Scripture, plainly require of us, the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible Diligence and Caution to avoid <HI>Sin.</HI></P>
<P>BUT how can he be &s;aid to u&s;e the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible diligence and caution to avoid <HI>Sin,</HI> that voluntarily does tho&s;e Things, that naturally expo&s;e and lead to <HI>Sin?</HI> How can he be &s;aid with the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible Caution to avoid an <HI>Enemy,</HI> that voluntarily lays him&s;elf in his way?

<P N="2"><PB N="31" REF="009961_0144_0F7B3E0178131E28">II. <HI>IT is evident that we ought to avoid tho&s;e Things that expo&s;e and lead to Sin; becau&s;e a due Sen&s;e of the Evil of Sin, and a ju&s;t hatred of it, will nece&s;&s;arily have this Effect upon us, to cau&s;e us &s;o to do.</HI></P>
<P>IF we were duly &s;en&s;ible of the Evil and dreadful Nature of <HI>Sin,</HI> we &s;hould have an exceeding dread of it upon our Spirits. We &s;hould hate it wor&s;e than <HI>Death,</HI> and &s;hould fear it wor&s;e than the Devil him|&s;elf: and dread it even as we dread <HI>Damnation.</HI> But tho&s;e Things that Men have an exceeding dread of upon their Spirits, they naturally and nece&s;&s;arily keep at a great di&s;tance from; and avoid tho&s;e Things that they apprehend expo&s;e to them. As a Child that has been greatly terrifyed by the &s;ight of any wild Bea&s;t; will by no Means be per&s;waded to go any where, where it apprehends that it &s;hall be expo&s;ed to it, or fall in it's Way.</P>
<P>SIN in it's own Nature is infinitely hateful, &s;o in it's natural tendency, it is infinitely dreadful. It is the tendency of all Sin, eternally to undo the Soul. Every Sin naturally carries <HI>Hell</HI> in it! Therefore, <HI>all Sin</HI> ought to be treated by us, as we would treat a Thing that is infinitely <HI>terrible.</HI> If it be not &s;o that any <HI>one</HI> Sin, yea the <HI>lea&s;t Sin,</HI> don't nece&s;&s;arily bring eternal Ruin with it; it is owing to nothing but the free Grace and Mercy of GOD to us, and not to the Nature and Tendency of <HI>Sin</HI> it &s;elf. But certainly, we ought not to take the le&s;s care to avoid <HI>Sin,</HI> or all that tends to it, for the freene&s;s and greatne&s;s of God's Mercy to us, through which, there is hope of Pardon; for that would be a mo&s;t ungrateful and vile abu&s;e of Mercy indeed. If it were &s;o, that it were made known to us, that if we ever voluntarily committed any particular Act of <HI>Sin</HI> we &s;hould be damned without any Remedy or E&s;cape, &s;hould we not exceedingly dread the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Sins? Should we not be very watchful and

careful to &s;tand at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance from that Sin: and from every thing that might expo&s;e us to <HI>it;</HI> and that has any tendency to &s;tir up our Lu&s;ts, or to be|tray us to &s;uch an Act of Sin? Let us then con&s;i|der, that if it be not &s;o, that the next voluntary Act of known <HI>Sin,</HI> &s;hall not nece&s;&s;arily and unavoidably i&s;&s;ue in certain <HI>Damnation;</HI> yet it will certainly de|&s;erve it: We &s;hall thereby really de&s;erve to be ca&s;t off, without any Remedy or Hope: and it can only be owing to free Grace, that it will not certainly and re|medile&s;ly be followed with &s;uch a Puni&s;hment. And &s;hall we be guilty of &s;uch a vile Abu&s;e of GOD's Mercy to us, as to take Encouragement from it, the more boldly to expo&s;e our &s;elves to <HI>Sin?</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>IT is evident that we ought not only to avoid Sin but Things that expo&s;e and lead to Sin; becau&s;e th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s is the Way we act in Things that pertain to our temporal Intere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>MEN do not only avoid tho&s;e Things that are them|&s;elves the hurt and ruin of their temporal Intere&s;t, but al&s;o the Things that tend or expo&s;e to it. Becau&s;e they love their temporal Lives, they will not only actu|ally avoid killing them&s;elves, but they are very care|ful to avoid tho&s;e Things that bring their Lives into Danger; tho' they do not certainly know but they may e&s;cape. They are careful not to pa&s;s Ri|vers and deep Waters on rotten Ice, tho' they do not certainly know that they &s;hall fall thro' and drown: So they will not only avoid tho&s;e Things that would be in them&s;elves the ruin of their E&s;tates; &s;uch as the &s;etting their own Hou&s;es on Fire, and burning them up with their Sub&s;tance; their taking their Money, and throwing it into the <HI>Sea,</HI> &amp;c. but they carefully avoid tho&s;e Things by which their E&s;tates are expo&s;ed. They are watchful, and have their Eyes about them; are careful who they deal with: they are watchful,
<PB N="33" REF="009961_0146_0F7B3E03F069AD40">
that they be not over reached in their Bargains; that they do not lay them&s;elves open to Knaves and frau|dulent Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>IF a Man be &s;ick of a dangerous Di&s;temper, he is careful to avoid every thing that tends to increa&s;e the Di&s;order; not only what he knows to be mortal in his Situation, but other Things that he fears the Con|&s;equence of, or that may be prejudicial to him. Men are in this Way wont to take care of their temporal Intere&s;t, as what they have a great Regard for. And therefore if we are not as careful to avoid <HI>Sin,</HI> as we are to avoid Injury in our temporal Intere&s;t, it will &s;hew a regardle&s;s Di&s;po&s;ition with Re&s;pect to Sin and Duty; or that we do not much care tho' we do &s;in again&s;t GOD. God's Glory is &s;urely a Thing of as much Importance and Concern as our temporal Intere&s;t. Certainly we &s;hould be as careful not to be expo&s;ed to &s;in again&s;t the MAJESTY of Heaven and Earth, as Men are wont to be of a few Pounds; yea, the latter are but meer Trifles, compared with the <HI>former.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>WE are wont to do thus by our dear earthly Friends.</HI></P>
<P>WE not only are careful of tho&s;e Things wherein the De&s;truction of their Lives, or their Hurt and Ca|lamity in any Re&s;pect do directly con&s;i&s;t; but are care|ful to avoid tho&s;e Things that do but remotely tend to it. We are careful to prevent and cut off all Occa&s;i|ons of their Lo&s;s or Damage, in any Re&s;pect; and are watchful again&s;t that, which tends in any wi&s;e, to de|prive them of their Comfort or good Name; and the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e they are very dear to us. In this Manner, Men are wont to be careful of the good of their own Children, and dread the Approaches of any Mi&s;chief that they apprehend they are, or may be ex|po&s;ed to. And we &s;hould take it hard if our Friends did not do thus by us.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="009961_0147_0F7B3E0488303CB8">AND &s;urely we ought to treat GOD as a dear FRIEND: We ought to act towards Him, as tho&s;e that have a &s;incere Love and unfeigned Regard to Him; and &s;o ought to watch and be careful again&s;t all Occa&s;ions of that which is contrary to his Honor &amp; Glory. If we have not a Temper and De&s;ire &s;o to do, it will &s;hew that whatever our Pretences are, we are not God's &s;incere Friends, and have no true love to Him.</P>
<P>IF we &s;hould be offended at any that have pro|fe&s;s'd Friend&s;hip to us, if they treated us in this man|ner and were no more careful of our Intere&s;t; &s;urely GOD may ju&s;tly be offended, that we are no more careful of his Glory.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>WE would have GOD in his Providence to|wards us, not order tho&s;e Things that tend to our hurt, or expo&s;e our Intere&s;t: therefore certainly we ought to avoid tho&s;e Things that lead to &s;in again&s;t him.</HI></P>
<P>WE de&s;ire and love to have God's Providence &s;uch toward us, as that our Welfare may be well &s;ecured. No Man loves to live in expo&s;ed, uncertain and dan|gerous Circum&s;tances. While he is &s;o, he lives un|comfortably, in that he lives in continual fear. We de&s;ire that GOD would &s;o order Things concerning us, that we may be &s;afe from <HI>fear</HI> of Evil: and that no Evil may come nigh our Dwelling; and that be|cau&s;e we dread Calamity. So we do not love the Appearance and Approaches of it; and love to have it at a <HI>great</HI> Di&s;tance from us. We de&s;ire to have GOD to be to us as a <HI>Wall of Fire round about us,</HI> to defend us; and that he would &s;urround us, as the Mountains do the Vallies, to guard us from every Danger, or Enemy; that &s;o no Evil may come nigh us.</P>
<P>NOW this plainly &s;hews, that we ought in our Beha|viour towards GOD, to keep at a great Di&s;tance from
<PB N="35" REF="009961_0148_0F7B3E0542528F08">
<HI>Sin,</HI> and from <HI>all</HI> that expo&s;es to it; as we de&s;ire GOD in his Providence to us, &s;hould keep Calamity and Mi&s;ery at a great Di&s;tance from us, and not order tho&s;e Things that expo&s;e our Welfare.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>Seeing we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to pray we may not be led into Temptation; certainly we ought not to run our &s;elves into it.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is one Reque&s;t that Chri&s;t directs us to make to GOD in that Form of Prayer, which he taught <HI>his</HI> Di&s;ciples &mdash; <HI>Lead us not into Temptation.</HI> And how incon&s;i&s;tent &s;hall we be with our &s;elves, if we pray to GOD, not to order it &s;o in his Providence, that we &s;hould be led into Temptations; and yet at the &s;ame Time, we are not careful to avoid Temptation; but bring our &s;elves into it, by doing tho&s;e Things that lead and expo&s;e to Sin. What Self-Contradiction is there in it, for a Man to pray to GOD that he may be kept from that, which he takes no care to avoid? By praying that we may be kept from Temptation, we profe&s;s to GOD, that being in Temptation, is a Thing that is to be avoided; but by running into it, &s;hew that we chu&s;e the contrary, viz. <HI>not</HI> to avoid it.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>The Apo&s;tle directs us to avoid tho&s;e Things that are in them&s;elves lawful, but tend to lead others into Sin; &s;urely then we &s;hould avoid what tends to lead our &s;elves into Sin.</HI></P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle directs to this, 1 Cor. viii. 9.&mdash; <HI>Take heed le&s;t&mdash;this Liberty of your's become a &s;tumbling-block to them that are weak.</HI> Rom. xiv. 13. &mdash;<HI>That no Man put a &s;tumbling Block, or an Occa&s;ion to fall in his Brother's Way.</HI> Ver. 15. <HI>But if thy Brother be grieved with thy Meat, now walke&s;t thou not cha|ritably. De&s;troy not him with thy Meat.</HI>&mdash;Ver. 20.21. <HI>For Meat de&s;troy not the Work of GOD. All Things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that Man
<PB N="36" REF="009961_0149_0F7B3E0626AAB268">
who eateth with Offence. It is good neither to eat Fle&s;h, nor to drink Wine, nor any Thing whereby thy Brother &s;tumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</HI></P>
<P>NOW if this Rule of the Apo&s;tle be agreeable to the Word of CHRIST, as we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, or expunge what he &s;ays out of the Canon of the Scripture; then a like Rule obliges more &s;trongly in tho&s;e Things that tend to lead our &s;elves into Sin.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>THERE are many Precepts of Scripture, that do directly and po&s;itively imply, that we ought to avoid tho&s;e Things that tend to Sin.</HI></P>
<P>THIS very Thing is commanded by CHRIST, Mat. xxvi. 41. where he directs us to <HI>watch</HI> le&s;t we enter <HI>into Temptation.</HI> But certainly running our &s;elves into Temptation, is the rever&s;e of watching again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Again, We are commanded to ab&s;tain from all Appearance of Evil; i. e. do by <HI>Sin,</HI> as a Man does by a Thing he hates the Sight or Appearance of; and therefore will avoid any Thing that favors of it, or looks like it; and will not come near it, or in Sight of it.</P>
<P>Again, CHRIST commanded to &s;eperate from us, tho&s;e Things that are &s;tumbling Blocks, or Occa&s;ions of Sin, however dear they are to us. Matth. v. 29. <HI>If thy right Eye offend thee, pluck it out and ca&s;t it from thee.</HI> Ver. 30. <HI>And if thy right Hand offend thee, cut it off</HI>&mdash; By <HI>the right Hand offending us,</HI> is not meant it's paining us; but the Word in the <HI>ori|ginal,</HI> &s;ignifies, being a &s;tumbling Block; if thy right Hand prove a &s;tumbling Block, or occa&s;ion to fall; i. e. an Occa&s;ion to Sin. Tho&s;e Things are called Offences or &s;tumbling Blocks in the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> that are the Occa&s;ions of falling into Sin. We ought to avoid running up again&s;t &s;tumbling Blocks; i. e. we &s;hould avoid tho&s;e Things that expo&s;e us to fall into Sin.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="009961_0150_0F7B3E0745B68E10">Yea CHRIST tells us, we mu&s;t avoid them, how|ever dear they are to us, tho' as dear as our right Hand or right Eye. If there be any Practice that we have been accu&s;tomed to, that naturally tends and ex|po&s;es us to Sin, we mu&s;t have done with it; tho' we love it never &s;o well; and are never &s;o loth to part with it; tho' it be as contrary to our Notion, as to cut off our right Hand, or pluck out our own right Eye; and that upon pain of <HI>Damnation,</HI> for it is in|timated that if we do not, we mu&s;t go with two Hands and two Eyes into <HI>Hell-Fire.</HI></P>
<P>AND again: GOD took great Care to forbid the Children of I&s;rael tho&s;e Things that tended to lead them into Sin. For this Rea&s;on, he forbid them mar|rying <HI>&s;trange Wives,</HI> (Deut. vii. 3, 4.) <HI>neither &s;halt thou make Marriages with them,&mdash; for they will turn away thy Son from following me, that they may &s;erve other Gods.</HI> For this Rea&s;on they were commanded to de&s;troy all tho&s;e Things, that the Nations of Canaan had u&s;ed in their Idolatry; and if any were enticed over to <HI>Idolatry,</HI> they were to be de&s;troyed without Mercy; tho' ever &s;o near and dear Friends. They were not only to be parted with, but <HI>&s;toned with Stones;</HI> yea they them&s;elves were to fall upon them, and put them to Death, tho' Son or Daughter, or their <HI>Bo&s;om</HI> Friend. (Deut. xiii. 6. &amp;c.) <HI>If thy Brother&mdash;or thy Son, or thy Daughter, or the Wife of thy Bo&s;om, or thy Friend, which is as thine own Soul, entice thee &s;e|cretly, &s;aying, let us go and &s;erve other Gods &mdash; thou &s;halt not con&s;ent unto him &mdash; neither &s;hall thine Eye pity him, neither &s;halt thou &s;pare, neither &s;halt thou conceal him. But thou &s;halt &s;urely kill him; thine Hand &s;hall be fir&s;t upon him to put him to Death.</HI></P>
<P>Again, THE wi&s;e Man warns us to avoid tho&s;e Things that tend and expo&s;e us to <HI>Sin;</HI> e&s;pecially the Sin of Uncleanne&s;s. Prov. vi. 27. <HI>Can a Man take Fire in his Bo&s;om, and his Clothes not be burnt? Can
<PB N="38" REF="009961_0151_0F7B3E07A480CD88">
one go upon hot Coals, and his Feet not be burnt?&mdash; So&mdash;who&s;oever touches her, &s;hall not be innocent.</HI> This is the Truth held forth; avoid tho&s;e Cu&s;toms and Practices, that naturally tend to &s;tir up Lu&s;t. And there are many Examples in Scripture, which have the force of Precept; and recorded, as not only wor|thy, but demand our Imitation. The Conduct of <HI>Jo|&s;eph</HI> in the Text is one; and that recorded of KING DAVID, is another. P&s;al. xxxix. 1, 2. <HI>I &s;aid I will take heed to my Ways, that I &s;in not with my Tongue: I will keep my Mouth with a Bridle, while the Wicked is before me. I was dumb with Silence, I held my Peace, even from good</HI>&mdash;even from good&mdash; that is, he was &s;o watchful over his Words, and kept at &s;uch a great Di&s;tance from &s;peaking what might in any Way tend to Sin; that he avoided, in certain Circum&s;tances, &s;peaking what was in it &s;elf lawful; le&s;t he &s;hould be betrayed into that which was &s;inful.</P>
<P N="9">IX. <HI>A prudent Sen&s;e of our own weakne&s;s, and ex|po&s;edne&s;s to yield to Temptation, obliges us to avoid that which leads or expo&s;es to Sin.</HI></P>
<P>WHOEVER knows him&s;elf and is &s;en&s;ible how weak he is; and his con&s;tant expo&s;edne&s;s to run into Sin; how full of Corruption his Heart is, which like Fuel, is expo&s;ed to catch Fire, and bring De&s;truction upon him; how much he has in him to incline him to Sin; and how unable he is to &s;tand of him&s;elf; who is &s;en|&s;ible of this, and has any Regard of his Duty, but will be very watchful again&s;t every thing that may lead and expo&s;e to <HI>Sin?</HI> On this Account Chri&s;t directed us, (Mat. xxvi. 41.) <HI>to watch and pray le&s;t we enter into Temptation.</HI> The Rea&s;on there is added, <HI>The Fle&s;h is weak!</HI> He that in Confidence of his own Strength, boldly runs the venture of &s;inning by going into Temp|tation, manife&s;ts great Pre&s;umption, and a &s;otti&s;h In|&s;en&s;ibility

<PB N="40" REF="009961_0153_0F7B3E0A46B623C0" MS="y">
this would be enough with <HI>all</HI> Chri&s;tians. Will a Follower of CHRIST &s;tand objecting and di&s;puting a|gain&s;t a Thing, that is irrefragably proved and demon|&s;trated to be his Duty?</P>
<P>BUT here &s;ome may be ready to inquire: How &s;hall we know what Things do lead and expo&s;e to Sin? Let a Man do what he will, he cannot avoid &s;inning, as long as he has &s;uch a corrupt Heart within him. And there is nothing a Man can do, or turn his Hand to, but that he may find &s;ome Temptation in it. And tho' it be true, as it is &s;aid in the fir&s;t Doctrine, that a Man ought, as far as may be, to avoid tho&s;e Things that lead and expo&s;e to Sin. And it is evident by the Arguments that have been brought, that tho&s;e Things that have &s;pecial tendency to expo&s;e Men to Sin, are what we ought to &s;hun, as much as in us lies: yet <HI>how</HI> &s;hall we judge and determine, what Things they are, that have a natural tendency to Sin; or do e&s;pe|cially lead to it?</P>
<P>I would an&s;wer in &s;ome Particulars, which are plain and ea&s;y; and which cannot be deny'd without the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>An&s;w. 1. <HI>That which is bordering on tho&s;e Sins, that the Lu&s;ts of Men's Hearts &s;trongly incline them to, is of this Sort.</HI> Men come into the World with many &s;trong and violent Lu&s;ts in their Hearts, and are ex|ceeding prone of them&s;elves to <HI>tran&s;gre&s;s;</HI> even in the &s;afe&s;t Circum&s;tances they can be placed in. And &s;urely &s;o much the nearer they are to that <HI>Sin,</HI> which they are naturally &s;trongly inclined to; &s;o much the more are they expo&s;ed. If any of us that are Pa|rents, &s;hould &s;ee our Children near the Brink of &s;ome deep Pit; or clo&s;e by the edge of the Precipice of an high Mountain; and not only &s;o, but the Ground up|on which the Child &s;tood, &s;lippery, and &s;leeply de&s;cend|ing directly toward he Precipice; &s;hould we not rec|kon

a Child expo&s;ed in &s;uch a Ca&s;e? Should we not be in ha&s;te to remove the Child from it's very dange|rous Situation?</P>
<P>IT was the manner among the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> to build their Hou&s;es with flat Roofs, &s;o that Per&s;ons might walk on the Tops of their Hou&s;es. And therefore God took care to make it a Law among them, that every Man &s;hould have Battlements upon the Edges of their Roofs; le&s;t any Per&s;on &s;hould fall off and be killed.

We &s;hould as it were, &s;ix a Battlement, a Guard to keep us from the Edge of the Precipice. Much more ought we to take care, that we don't go upon a Roof that is not only without Battlements, but when it is &s;teep, and we &s;hall naturally incline to fall.</P>
<P>MEN's Lu&s;ts are like &s;trong Enemies, endeavour|ing to draw them into Sin. If a Man &s;tood upon a dangerous Precipice, and had Enemies about him, pul|ling and drawing him, endeavouring to throw him down; would one, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, chu&s;e, or dare to &s;tand near the Edge? Would he look upon him&s;elf &s;afe clo&s;e on the Brink? Would he not endeavour for his own &s;afety, to keep at a Di&s;tance?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THOSE Things that tend to feed Lu&s;ts in the Imagination, are of this Kind.</HI></P>
<P>They lead and expo&s;e Men to Sin. Tho&s;e Things that have a natural tendency to excite in the Mind, the Idea or Imagination of that which is the Object of the Lu&s;t, certainly tend to feed and promote that Lu&s;t. What can be more plain and evident, than that a pre|&s;enting the Object, tends to &s;tir up the Appetite? Rea|&s;on and Experience teach this.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="009961_0155_0F7B3E0BB8F471C0">THEREFORE, <HI>all Things,</HI> whether they be Words or Actions, have a tendency and expo&s;e to <HI>Sin,</HI> that tend to rai&s;e and uphold in the Mind's Imaginations or Ideas, tho&s;e Things which the Lu&s;t tends to. It is certainly wrong and unlawful to feed a Lu&s;t even in the Imagination. It is quite contrary to the holy Rules of God's Word. (Prov. xxiv. 9) <HI>The Thought of fooli&s;h|ne&s;s is Sin.</HI> (Mat. v. 28.) <HI>Who&s;oever looketh on a Woman to lu&s;t after her, hath committed Adultery&mdash;.</HI> A Man by gratifying his Lu&s;ts in his Imagination and Thoughts, may make his Soul in the Sight of GOD, to be a <HI>Hold of foul Spirits;</HI> and like a <HI>Cage of every unclean and hurtful Bird.</HI> And &s;inful Imaginations tend to &s;inful Actions and outward Behaviour in the End. Lu&s;t is always fir&s;t contrived in the Imagina|tion, and then brought forth in the outward Practice. You may &s;ee the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ogre&s;s of it in, Jam. i. 15. <HI>Then when Lu&s;t hath conceived, it bringeth forth Sin.</HI></P>
<P>THEREFORE for a Man to do tho&s;e Things that tend to excite the Objects of his Lu&s;ts in his Imagina|tion, he does that which has as natural a tendency to Sin, as a Conception has to a Birth. And &s;uch Things are therefore abominable in the Sight of a pure and holy GOD. We are commanded to keep at the great|e&s;t Di&s;tance from &s;piritual Pollution; and to hate even the very <HI>Garment &s;potted with the Fle&s;h,</HI> Jude 23.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THOSE things that the Experience and Ob|&s;ervation of Mankind &s;hew to be ordinarily attended or followed with Sin, are of this Sort.</HI></P>
<P>Experience is a good Rule to determine by in things of this Nature. How is it we know the natural ten|dency of any thing, but only by Ob&s;ervation and Ex|perience? Men ob&s;erve and find, time after time, that &s;uch Things are commonly attended and followed with &s;uch other things. And hence Mankind pro|nounce of them, that they have a natural tendency to them. We have no other Way to know the tendency
<PB N="43" REF="009961_0156_0F7B3E0BF90C4368">
of any thing. Thus Men by Ob&s;ervation and Expe|rience know that the warmth of the Sun, and &s;howers of Rain, are attended with the growth of Plants of the Earth: and hence they learn, that they have a tendency to it. So they find by Experience, that the bite of &s;ome Kinds of Serpents, is commonly followed with Illne&s;s; and often with Death. Hence they learn, that the bite of &s;uch Serpents has a natural ten|dency to bring Di&s;order upon the Body, and expo&s;es to Death.</P>
<P>AND &s;o, if Experience and common Ob&s;ervation &s;hews, that any particular Practice or Cu&s;tom is com|monly attended with that which is very &s;inful, we may &s;afely conclude that &s;uch a Practice tends to Sin; that it leads and expo&s;es to it.</P>
<P>THUS we may determine that Tavern-haunting and Gaming, are things that tend to Sin; becau&s;e common Experience and Ob&s;ervation &s;hew, that tho&s;e Practices are attended with a great deal of Sin and Wickedne&s;s. The Ob&s;ervation of all Ages and all Nations, with one Voice declares it. It &s;hews, where Taverns are much frequented, for drinking and the like, they are e&s;peci|ally Places of Sin, of Prophanene&s;s and other Wicked|ne&s;s: and it &s;hews, that tho&s;e Towns, where there is much of this, are Places where no Good generally pre|vails. And it al&s;o &s;hews, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons that are given much to frequenting Taverns, are mo&s;t common|ly vicious Per&s;ons. And &s;o of Gaming; as playing at Cards, Experience &s;hews, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons that prac|tice this, do generally fall into much Sin. Hence the&s;e Practices are become infamous among all &s;ober vertu|ous Per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>ANOTHER way by which Per&s;ons may deter|mine of &s;ome Things, that they lead and expo&s;e to Sin, is by their own Experience, or what they have found in them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="009961_0157_0F7B3E0CC2CE8568">IF Per&s;ons have found in them&s;elves, from time to time, that they have actually led them into Sin, this &s;urely is enough to convince them, that &s;uch things do actually lead and expo&s;e to Sin: For what will con|vince Men, if their own Experience will not? Thus if Men have found by undeniable Experience, that any Practice or Cu&s;tom &s;tirs up Lu&s;t in them, and has betray'd them into fooli&s;h and &s;inful Behaviour, or &s;in|ful Thoughts; they may determine, that they lead and expo&s;e to Sin. Or if they upon examining them|&s;elves, mu&s;t own that &s;uch a Cu&s;tom or Practice, has time after time, had that Effect upon them, as to di&s;|po&s;e them to Sins of Omi&s;&s;ion of known Duty; &s;uch as &s;ecret Prayer; and make them more backward to it: and al&s;o to indi&s;po&s;e them to reading and religious Meditation; and they, after they have been doing &s;uch or &s;uch a thing, have found this has commonly been the Effect of it, that they have been more apt to ca&s;t off Prayer; or has had a tendency to the neglect of Family Prayer. Or if it &s;eems to lead to unwatch|fulne&s;s; they find &s;ince they have complied with &s;uch a Cu&s;tom, they are le&s;s watchful of their Hearts, le&s;s di&s;pos'd to any thing that is &s;erious; that the frame of their Mind is more light, and their Hearts le&s;s on the things of another World, and more after Vanity; tho&s;e are &s;inful Effects; and therefore if Experience &s;hews a Cu&s;tom or Practice to be attended with the&s;e things, then Experience &s;hews that they lead and expo&s;e to Sin.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>WE may determine whether a thing be of an evil tendency or not, by the Effect that an out-pouring of the Spirit of GOD, and a general flouri&s;hing of Religion, has with re&s;pect to it.</HI></P>
<P>IF a pouring out of the Spirit of GOD on a Peo|ple, puts a &s;top to any Practice or Cu&s;tom, and roots
<PB N="45" REF="009961_0158_0F7B3E0DAF6F8248">
it out; &s;urely it argues, that <HI>that</HI> Practice or Cu&s;tom is of no good tendency. For if there be no hurt in it, and it tends to no hurt, why &s;hould the Spirit of GOD de|&s;troy it? The Spirit of GOD has no tendency to de|droy any thing that is neither &s;inful, nor has any ten|dency to &s;in. Why &s;hould it? Why &s;hould we &s;up|po&s;e, that the Spirit of GOD &s;hould be an Enemy to that which has no hurt in it; nor has any tendency to that which is hurtful?</P>
<P>THE flouri&s;hing of <HI>Religion</HI> has no tendency to aboli&s;h or expel any thing that is no way again&s;t <HI>Reli|gion.</HI> That which is not again&s;t <HI>Religion,</HI> Religion will not appear again&s;t. Religion has no tendency to de&s;troy any Cu&s;tom or Practice, that has no tendency to de&s;troy that. It is a Rule that holds in all contraries and oppo&s;ites: the Oppo&s;ition is equal on both Sides. So contrary as Light is to Darkne&s;s, &s;o contrary is Dark|ne&s;s to Light. It is equal both Ways. So, ju&s;t &s;o contrary as the flouri&s;hing of Religion is to any Cu&s;tom, ju&s;t &s;o contrary is that Cu&s;tom to the flouri&s;hing of Religion. That Cu&s;tom that Religion tends to de|&s;troy, that Cu&s;tom, if it prevail, tends al&s;o to de&s;troy Religion. Therefore, if the flouri&s;hing of Religion and the out-pouring of the Spirit of GOD, tends to overthrow any Cu&s;tom, that takes Place or prevails, we may &s;urely determine, that <HI>that</HI> Cu&s;tom is either in it &s;elf &s;inful, or tends and expo&s;es to Evil.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>WE may determine by the Effect that a gene|ral decay of Religion has with re&s;pect to them, whe|ther they be Things of a &s;inful tendency or not.</HI></P>
<P>IF they be Things that come with a <HI>decay of Re|ligion,</HI> that creep in as <HI>that</HI> decays, we may determine they are things of no good tendency. The withdraw|ing of Good, don't let in Good but Evil. 'Tis Evil, not Good, comes in, as Good gradually cea&s;es. What is it but Darkne&s;s that comes in, as Light withdraws.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="009961_0159_0F7B3E0E381C1AF0">Therefore if there be any decay of Religion in the Town, or in particular Per&s;ons, and upon this, any cer|tain Cu&s;toms or Practices take Place and are allowed, which were wholly ab&s;tained from &amp; renounced, when Religion was in a more flouri&s;hing State; we may &s;afely conclude that &s;uch Cu&s;toms and Practices are contrary to the Nature of true Religion: and there|fore in them&s;elves &s;inful, or tending to Sin.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>WE may in many things determine whether any Cu&s;tom be of a good tendency, by con&s;idering what the Effect would be, if it was openly and univer&s;ally owned and practiced.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are many things that &s;ome Per&s;ons practice &s;omewhat &s;ecretly, and are partly hidden in; and that they plead to be not hurtful; which, if they had &s;ui|table Con&s;ideration to di&s;cern what the Con&s;equence would be, if every Body openly practiced the &s;ame, it would &s;oon &s;hew that the Con&s;equence would be Con|fu&s;ion, and a mo&s;t woful State of things. If there|fore there be any Cu&s;tom, that is of &s;uch a Nature, that it will not bear univer&s;al open Practice and Pro|fe&s;&s;ion; but if it &s;hould come to <HI>that,</HI> the lea&s;t Con&s;i|deration will &s;hew that the Con&s;equence would be la|mentable; we may determine that <HI>that</HI> Cu&s;tom is of an ill tendency. For if there is no hurt in it, and it is neither &s;inful in it &s;elf, nor tends to any thing &s;in|ful, then it is no matter how open and univer&s;al the World is in it; for we need not be afraid of that Cu&s;tom's being too prevalent and univer&s;al, that has no ill tendency in it.</P>
<P>THUS I have mentioned &s;ome general Rules, by which to determine and judge, what things are of a bad and &s;inful tendency. And the&s;e things are &s;o plain, that for a Per&s;on to deny them, would be ab|&s;urd and ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="009961_0160_0F7B3E1049AB2C88">I would now, in the Name of GOD, warn all Per|&s;ons to avoid &s;uch things, as appear by the&s;e Rules to lead and expo&s;e to Sin. And particularly, I would now take Occa&s;ion to warn our young People, as they would approve them&s;elves Fearers of GOD, to avoid all &s;uch things in Company, that being try'd by the&s;e Rules, will appear to have a tendency or lead to Sin. Avoid all &s;uch Ways of talking and eating as have a tendency to this; and follow the Example of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in this.</P>
<P>NOT only the mo&s;t gro&s;s Acts of Uncleanne&s;s, but all Deg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ees of Laciviou&s;ne&s;s, both in talking and eat|ing, are &s;trictly forbidden in Scripture; as what &s;hould not be &s;o much as once named among Saints or Chri&s;ti|ans.

<P>AND I de&s;ire that certain Cu&s;toms that are common among young People in the Country, and have been &s;o a long time, may be examined by tho&s;e Rules that have been mentioned. That Cu&s;tom in particular, of young People of different Sexes lying in Bed together; however light is made of it, and however ready Per|&s;ons may be to laugh at it's being condemned: if it be examined by the Rules that have been mentioned, it will appear, pa&s;t all Contradiction, to be one of tho&s;e things that lead and expo&s;e to Sin: And I believe what Experience and Fact will &s;hew of the Con&s;equence

and Event of it, does abundantly bear Witne&s;s to it. And whoever wi&s;ely con&s;iders the Matter, mu&s;t &s;ay, that this Cu&s;tom of this Country (to which it &s;eems to be peculiar, among People that pretend to uphold their Credit) has been one main thing that has lead to that growth of Uncleanne&s;s, that has been in the Land. And &s;o there are other Cu&s;toms and Liberties that are cu&s;tomarily u&s;ed, among young People in Company, that they that u&s;e them know that they lead to Sin.&mdash; They know that they tend to &s;tir up their Lu&s;ts &mdash; that it does do it&mdash;and this is the very End for which they do it, to gratify their Lu&s;ts in &s;ome Mea&s;ure. Little do &s;uch Per&s;ons con&s;ider, what a holy GOD they are &s;oon to be judged by, that now make a <HI>mock at Sin;</HI> who abominates the Impurities of their Hearts.</P>
<P>IF therefore they do actually &s;tir up and feed Lu&s;t, then certainly they tend to further Degrees and more gro&s;s Acts. That which &s;tirs up Lu&s;t, makes it more violent, and does therefore certainly the more expo&s;e Per&s;ons to be overcome by it. How evident and un|deniable are the&s;e things; and how &s;trange that any &s;hould cavil again&s;t them, or make a Deri&s;ion of them!</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly you may be confident of your own Strength; and may think with your &s;elf, that you are not in Danger, that there is no Temptation in the&s;e things, but what you are able ea&s;ily to overcome. But you &s;hould con&s;ider that the mo&s;t &s;elf-confident are mo&s;t in danger. <HI>Peter</HI> was very confident, that he &s;hould not deny CHRIST, but how dreadfully otherwi&s;e was the Event! If when others that have fallen into gro&s;s Sins, &s;hould be inquired of, and &s;hould declare how it was with them; doubtle&s;s they would &s;ay, that they at fir&s;t tho't there was no danger; they were far from the Thought that ever they &s;hould commit &s;uch Wicked|ne&s;s; but yet by venturing further and further, they fell at la&s;t into the foule&s;t and gro&s;&s;e&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.
<PB N="49" REF="009961_0162_0F7B3E119C320098">
And Per&s;ons may long with&s;tand Temptation, and be &s;uddenly overcome at la&s;t. None &s;o much in danger, as the mo&s;t bold. <HI>They</HI> are mo&s;t &s;afe, that are mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of their own Weakne&s;s; and mo&s;t di&s;tru&s;tful of their own Hearts; and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of their con|tinual need of re&s;training Grace. Young Per&s;ons, with re&s;pect to the Sin of Uncleanne&s;s, are dealt with by the Devil, ju&s;t as &s;ome give an account of &s;ome &s;ort of Serpents charming of Birds, and other Animals down into their Mouths&mdash;if the Serpent takes them with his Eyes; tho' they &s;eem to be affrighted by it; yet will not flee away; but will keep the Serpent in Sight, and approach nearer and nearer to him, till they fall a Prey.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Cu&s;tom that I de&s;ire may be examined by the forementioned Rules, is that of young People of both Sexes getting together in the Nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in tho&s;e Companies for Mirth and Jollity, that they call Fro|licks; &s;o &s;pending the time together 'till late in the Night, in their Jollity. I de&s;ire our young People to &s;uffer their Ears to be open to what I have to &s;ay upon this Point; as I am the Me&s;&s;enger of the Lord of Ho&s;ts to them; and not determine that they will not hearken, before they have heard what I &s;hall &s;ay. I hope there are but few Per&s;ons among us &s;o abandoned, as to determine that they will go on in a Practice, whe|ther they are convinced that it is unlawful or not; or tho' it &s;hould be proved to them to be unlawful by undeniable Arguments.</P>
<P>Therefore let us examine this Cu&s;tom and Practice by what has been &s;aid. It has been proved undenia|bly, that we ought not to go on in a Practice that leads and expo&s;es to Sin; and Rules have been laid down to judge what does thus expo&s;e and lead to it, that I think are plain and undeniable.</P>
<P>Therefore now let us try this Cu&s;tom by the&s;e Rules, and &s;ee whether it will bear the Te&s;t or not.
<PB N="50" REF="009961_0163_0F7B3E121465B9B8">
Certainly a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> will not be unwilling to have his Practices examined and tried by the Rules of Rea&s;on and God's Word; but will rather rejoyce in it.</P>
<P>AND I de&s;ire particularly that the Practice may be tried by that &s;ure Touch-&s;tone of Experience. Let it be tried by the Con&s;ideration of what is expe|rienced in fact abroad in one Town and Place and ano|ther. This is one of the Rules of Trial that have been mentioned, that <HI>that Cu&s;tom that the Experience and Ob&s;ervation of Mankind &s;hews to be ordinarily attended or followed with Sin, may be determined and concluded to be unlawful.</HI> And if we look abroad in the Country, I doubt not but the&s;e two things will be found.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT as to tho&s;e Towns, where there is mo&s;t of this carried on among young People, (as there is more of it in &s;ome Places than others) it will be found, as a thing that univer&s;ally holds, that they the young People there are commonly a loo&s;e, vain and irreligi|ous Generation; little regarding GOD, Heaven or Hell, or any thing but vanity. And that commonly in tho&s;e Towns where is mo&s;t frolicking carried on, there are the mo&s;t frequent breakings out of gro&s;s Sins; Fornication in particular.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF we try it by Per&s;ons. If we go thro' the Country, we &s;hall for the mo&s;t Part find, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons that are the greate&s;t Frolickers, and are mo&s;t addicted to this Practice, which we are &s;peaking of; they are the Per&s;ons furthe&s;t from &s;erious Thought, and are the vaine&s;t and loo&s;e&s;t upon other Accounts. And whence &s;hould this be, if &s;uch a Practice was not &s;inful, or had not a natural tendency to lead Per&s;ons into Sin.</P>
<P>AND furthermore, I appeal to the Experience of you here pre&s;ent, as to what you have found in your &s;elves. I de&s;ire tho&s;e of you that have made Pre|tences of &s;erious Religion, and &s;aving Piety, and have
<PB N="51" REF="009961_0164_0F7B3E12E8118D98">
hitherto pretended to keep up Religion in your Clo|&s;ets, and your own Souls; that <HI>you</HI> would &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;k your &s;elves whether or no you have not found, that this Practice has indi&s;pos'd you to &s;erious Religion, and taken off your Minds from it? Has it not tended to your neglect of &s;ecret Prayer? Have you not found, that after you have been to a Frolick, you have been more backward to that Duty? And if you have not wholly neglected it, have you not found that you have been abundantly more &s;lighty, and ready to turn it off in any Manner, and glad to have it done with? And more backward to reading and &s;erious Meditation, and &s;uch things? And that your Mind has been exceedingly diverted from Religion, and that for &s;ome time?</P>
<P>I don't &s;end you far off to find out whether this Cu&s;tom be not of bad tendency &mdash;not beyond the Sea, to &s;ome di&s;tant Country: I &s;end you no further than to your own Brea&s;t to examine your own Experience in this Matter; let the Matter be determined by that.</P>
<P>AND then again, let us try this Cu&s;tom, by the Ef|fect the Out-pouring of the Spirit of GOD on a Peo|ple has with Re&s;pect to it. This we are under great Advantage to do; becau&s;e there has lately been here in this Place, a mo&s;t remarkable out-pouring of the Spirit of GOD, that ever has been in NEW-ENG|LAND, and it may be in the WORLD; &s;ince the A|po&s;tles Days. And 'tis known, that before this, that Cu&s;tom of young People's Frolicking did prevail in the Town. And here we all know the Effect it had. It put an end to it.&mdash;It was a Cu&s;tom that was wholly done with&mdash;It was altogether laid a&s;ide; and was &s;o for &s;everal Years.</P>
<P>IT has been already &s;hewn that there is no account can be given why the Spirit of GOD, and the flou|ri&s;hing of Religion &s;hould aboli&s;h &s;uch a Cu&s;tom, unle&s;s
<PB N="52" REF="009961_0165_0F7B3E138345A580">
it be becau&s;e that Cu&s;tom, is either in its Nature or Tendency an Enemy to the Spirit of GOD, and Reli|gion.</P>
<P>THE Fruits of the Spirit of GOD are good, and I hope there is none that have the Bla&s;phemy to &s;ay otherwi&s;e. And therefore it is good that this Cu&s;tom &s;hould be removed; for this is plainly one of the Ef|fects of the Spirit of GOD. And if &s;o, 'tis becau&s;e the Cu&s;tom is bad, either in it's Nature or Tendency; otherwi&s;e there would be no good in its being removed. The Spirit of GOD aboli&s;hed this Cu&s;tom for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e if it had been kept up in the Town, it would have had a direct tendency to hinder that Work that the Spirit was about to do among&s;t us. This was undeniably the Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing &s;uch a Cu&s;tom had been begun and &s;et up, by the young People all over the Town, in the mid&s;t of the Time of the late out-pouring of the Spirit, all of a &s;udden; would any wi&s;e Per&s;ons, that have truly the Cau&s;e of Religion at Heart; rejoyced at it? Would not every one at fir&s;t Thought have concluded, with|out any he&s;itation, that it was a thing that look'd dark|ly upon the Intere&s;t of Religion; and that there was great Danger that it would take off People's Minds from Religion, and make them vain; and &s;o put an end to the flouri&s;hing of Religion? Would not every con&s;iderate Per&s;on in this Town have thought thus of it? And if &s;uch a Cu&s;tom would have had an ill ten|dency then, &s;o it will now.</P>
<P><HI>Objection.</HI> The Town is not in &s;uch Circum&s;tances now, as it was then. And tho' it might have done hurt then, by putting an end to the great Concern; yet now it may do no hurt: for there is now no &s;uch great Concern to be put an end to by it.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Tho' the Town is not in &s;uch Circum|&s;tances now as it was then, yet it ought to be; there ought to be as much Engagedne&s;s of Mind about Re|ligion;

as much Concern among Sinners, and as much Engagedne&s;s among the godly, as then: and it is to our Shame that there is not. And if &s;uch a Practice would have tended to de&s;troy &s;uch a religious Concern, then it certainly tends to prevent it now. It is a Rule that will hold, That <HI>that</HI> which has a tendency to de|&s;troy a Thing when it is, tends to prevent it when it is not. And are we not praying from Sabbath to Sab|bath, and from Day to Day, for &s;uch a Concern again? And do not tho&s;e of you that pretend to be converted, that have lately &s;et up this Cu&s;tom, pray for the &s;ame? Are you a Convert, a Saint, and yet not de&s;ire that there &s;hould be any more pouring out of the Spirit of GOD? The Town has Cau&s;e to be a&s;hamed of &s;uch Converts, if it has any &s;uch? And if you do, why do you do what tends to prevent it?</P>
<P>Again, LET this Practice be tried by the Effect that a general Decay of Religion has with re&s;pect to it. Now we have a trial: it is now a Time that Religion is greatly decay'd among&s;t us; and the Effect is, that this Cu&s;tom comes in with this Decay. Young People begin again to &s;et up their old Cu&s;tom of Fro|licking, and &s;pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing great Part of the Night in it, to the violation of Family Orders. What is the Rea&s;on, if this Cu&s;tom is not bad, either in its Nature or Ten|dency, that it did not come in before, when Religion was lively? Why does it &s;tay 'till it can take the Advantage of the withdrawment of Religion? This is a &s;ign that it is a Cu&s;tom that &s;huns a Spirit of lively Religion, as Darkne&s;s &s;huns the Light, and never comes in 'till Light withdraws.</P>
<P>AND here again, I would &s;end Per&s;ons to their own Experience. How did this Practice come in with you in particular: <HI>you,</HI> that two or three Years ago, &s;eem'd to be &s;o engag'd in Religion? Did it not come in, did you not begin to practice it, as the &s;en&s;e of Religion wore off? And what is the matter? Why did not
<PB N="54" REF="009961_0167_0F7B3E1505B6B138">
you &s;et up the Practice <HI>then,</HI> when your Heart was taken up about reading, Meditation, and &s;ecret Prayer to GOD? If <HI>this</HI> do not at all &s;tand in the Way of them, and is no hindrance to them, why was you not engaged in both together? What account can you give of it? Why did you leave off this Practice and Cu&s;tom, or ab&s;tain from it? To what Purpo&s;e is this changing? One while it mu&s;t be avoided as evil, and another while practiced and pleaded for as good? The making &s;uch an alteration does not look well, nor will it be for the honor of Religion in the Eye of the World. For whether the Practice be lawful or no, yet &s;uch a thing will &s;urely be improved to our di&s;|advantage. For your avoiding of it <HI>then,</HI> has this ap|pearance, in the Eye of the Country; that <HI>then</HI> you condemned it: and therefore your now returning to it, will appear to them as back&s;liding in you. Such Changelings are ever more, in the Eye of the World, greatly to the di&s;honour of the Profe&s;&s;ion they are of, let it be what it will.</P>
<P>Indeed, this Cu&s;tom as it is practi&s;ed, does not only tend to <HI>Sin,</HI> but is in it &s;elf very di&s;orderly, &s;inful and &s;hameful. For it is attended late in the Night, and in the dead of the Night, to the neglect of Family Prayer, and violating all family Order; which is Di&s;order and Profanene&s;s. Is that lawful to rob GOD of his ordi|nary Sacrifices, for the &s;ake of your Plea&s;ure, Diver&s;ion, and Jollity? Are you of that Mind, that it is a de|cent thing, that the &s;tated Wor&s;hip of the great GOD, &s;hould give Way to your Mirth, and your Diver&s;ions? Is this the Way of GOD's holy Children, to talk after this Manner? Tho&s;e Works that are commonly done in the dead of the Night, &s;eem to have a black Mark &s;et upon them, by the Apo&s;tle, and Chri&s;tians are ex|horted to avoid them, Rom. xiii. 12, 13.&mdash;<HI>Let us ca&s;t off the Works of Darkne&s;s, and let us put on the Ar|mour of Light. Let us walk hone&s;tly, as in the Day;

not in Rioting and Drunkenne&s;s; not in Chambering and Wantonne&s;s</HI> &mdash;. The Word here rendered, <HI>rioting</HI> is of far different Signification from the term, as u&s;ed in our Laws: for the forcible doing an unlawful Thing, by three or more Per&s;ons a&s;&s;embled together for that Purpo&s;e. Words as they are terms in the Law, are often u&s;ed very much be&s;ide their com|mon Signification. But the Word here properly &s;igni|fies, a di&s;orderly Convention of Per&s;ons to &s;pend their time together in Plea&s;ure and Jollity. So the Word is commonly u&s;ed in Scripture&punc; (Prov. xxiii. 20.) <HI>Be not among&s;t riotous eaters of Fle&s;h.</HI> (Prov. xxviii. 7.) &mdash; <HI>He that is a Companion of riotous Men, &s;hameth his Father.</HI> (Luk xv. 13.)&mdash;<HI>wa&s;ted his Sub&s;tance with riotous living.</HI></P>
<P>Again, a black Mark &s;eems to be &s;et on &s;uch in Scripture, (as in 1 The&s;&s;. v. 5.6, 7, 8.) <HI>Ye are all Children of the Light, and the Children of the Day: we are not of the Night, nor of Darkne&s;s. Therefore let us not &s;leep as do others; but let us watch and be &s;ober. For they that &s;leep, &s;leep in the Night; and they that be drunk, are drunken in the Night.</HI></P>
<P>MANY of you that have lately &s;et up this Practice of frolicking and jollity, profe&s;s to be Children of the Light and of the Day; and not to be the Children of Darkne&s;s. Therefore walk as in the Day: and do not tho&s;e Works of Darkne&s;s, that are commonly done at un&s;ea&s;onable Hours of the Night.</P>
<P>Such things are not only condemned by the Apo&s;tle, but are looked upon infamous thro' the World in all Ages among &s;oberer &s;ort of People; and all pa&s;t Wri|tings &s;hew it. Therefore it is a thing of bad Report, and &s;o forbidden (Phil. iv. 8) &mdash;<HI>What&s;oever things are of good Report; if there be any Virtue &mdash; any Prai&s;e, think on the&s;e Things.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="009961_0169_0F7B3E16C46313D0"><HI>Objection.</HI> 1. But the wi&s;e Man allows of this Practice, when he &s;ays, Eccle&s;. iii. 4. <HI>There is a time to mourn, and a time to dance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> This is nothing to the Purpo&s;e; for the utmo&s;t that any can pretend that it proves, is denying it to be lawful, and allowing it may be u&s;ed under &s;ome Circum&s;tances: but not at all, that <HI>dancing</HI> and other things u&s;ed by our young People in their Frolicks are lawful, in tho&s;e Circum&s;tances; any more than what is &s;aid in the &s;ame Chapter, &vers;. 3. &mdash; <HI>there is a time to kill,</HI> proves that it is lawful for a Man to commit Murder.</P>
<P>To deny that dancing under any Circum&s;tances whatever, was lawful, would be ab&s;urd: for there was a religious dancing in the Jewi&s;h Church, that was a way of expre&s;&s;ing their &s;piritual Mirth. So <HI>David</HI> danced before the LORD. And he calls upon others to prai&s;e GOD in the dance. So there may be other Circum&s;tances wherein dancing may not be unlawful. But all this makes nothing to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e; to prove that this particular Cu&s;tom, that we have been &s;peaking of among&s;t our young People, is not of a bad tendency. And be&s;ides, when the wi&s;e Man &s;ays, there is <HI>a time to dance,</HI> that does not prove, that the dead of the Night is the time for it. The &s;ame wi&s;e Man don't ju&s;tify carnal Mirth, but condemns it. <HI>Eccl.</HI> ii. 2. <HI>I &s;aid of Laughter it is mad; and of Mirth, what doeth it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. If we avoid all &s;uch things, it will be the way for our young People to be ignorant how to behave them&s;elves in Company.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> But con&s;ider what this Objection comes to. It certainly comes to this, viz. That the pouring out of the Spirit of GOD upon a People, tends to bani&s;h all good Conduct, good Breeding and decent Behavi|our from among them; and to &s;ink them down into
<PB N="57" REF="009961_0170_0F7B3E17E725AAE0">
Clowni&s;hne&s;s and Barbarity. And if &s;uch a pouring out of the Spirit of GOD, as has been among&s;t us, &s;hould be continued, it would tend to have <HI>this</HI> Effect; for that we have &s;een by Experience. The Spirit of GOD did actually put an end to this Practice among us.</P>
<P>BUT who is it among&s;t us that is not a&s;hamed to make &s;uch an Objection? Will any of our young Converts talk thus? Will you that think you was con|verted by the late pouring out of the Spirit of GOD, and are made holy Per&s;ons, Heirs of eternal Life, talk &s;o bla&s;phemou&s;ly of it?</P>
<P>IF our young People are re&s;olute &s;till to go on, not|with&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid, I hope that tho&s;e of them that call them&s;elves converted will fir&s;t find out &s;ome rational, &s;atisfying An&s;wer to the Arguments that have been u&s;ed again&s;t it. This at lea&s;t may be rea|&s;onably expected of them, &s;eeing they make &s;uch a Profe&s;&s;ion. You have this Day been partaking of the Sacrament of the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> and therein &s;olemnly renewed your Profe&s;&s;ion &mdash;</P>
<P>If after &s;uch Light &s;et before you, and &s;uch Mercy given, you will go on, BE IT KNOWN TO YOU, that your eating now, and at other times, will prove only an eating and drinking <HI>Judgment</HI> to your &s;elves.</P>
<P>AND I de&s;ire Heads of Families, if they have any Government over their Children; or any command of their own Hou&s;es; would not tolerate their Children in &s;uch Practices, nor &s;uffer &s;uch Conventions in their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>I don't de&s;ire that young People &s;hould be abridg'd of any lawful and proper Liberties.&mdash; But this Cu&s;tom can be of no Benefit or Service in the World: it tends only to Mi&s;chief.&mdash;</P>

<P>Under&s;tand, ye bruti&s;h among the People: and ye Fools, when will ye be wi&s;e? He that planted the Ear, &s;hall he not hear? he that formed the Eye, &s;hall he not &s;ee?

<P>_IN the&s;e Words the following Things are to be ob&s;erved. 1. A certain &s;piritual Di&s;|ea&s;e charged on &s;ome, viz. Darkne&s;s and blindne&s;s of Mind, appearing in their Ig|norance and Folly. 2. The great De|gree of this Di&s;ea&s;e; &s;o as to render the Subjects of it <HI>Fools.</HI> "Ye Fools, when will ye be wi&s;e?" And &s;o as to reduce them to a Degree of Bruti&s;hne&s;s. "Ye bruti&s;h among the People." This Ignorance and Folly was to &s;uch a Degree, as to render Men like Bea&s;ts.
<PB N="60" REF="009961_0173_0F7B3E20DCEBB790">
3. The ob&s;tinacy of this Di&s;ea&s;e; expre&s;s'd in that Interrogation, when will ye be wi&s;e? Their blindne&s;s and folly was not only very great; but deeply rooted and e&s;tabli&s;hed, re&s;i&s;ting all manner of cure. 4. Of what Nature this blindne&s;s is. It is e&s;pecially in things pertaining to God. They were &s;trangely ignorant of his Perfections, like Bea&s;ts: and had fooli&s;h Notions of him, as tho' he did not &s;ee, nor know; and as tho' he would not execute Ju&s;tice, by cha&s;ti&s;ing and puni&s;h|ing wicked Men. 5. The unrea&s;onablene&s;s and &s;ot|ti&s;he&s;s of the Notion they had of God, that he did not hear, did not ob&s;erve their Reproaches of him and his People, is &s;hewn by ob&s;erving that he planted the Ear. 'Tis very unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that he who gave Power of perceiving Words, to others, &s;hould not per|ceive them him&s;elf. And the &s;otti&s;hne&s;s of their be|ing in&s;en&s;ible of God's all &s;eeing Eye, and particularly of his &s;eeing their wicked Actions, appears, in that God is the Being who formed the Eye, and gave others a Power of &s;eeing. The &s;otti&s;hne&s;s of their Apprehen|hen&s;ion of GOD, as tho' he did not know what they did, is argued from his being the Fountain and Origi|nal of all Knowledge. The unrea&s;onablen&s;s of their expecting to e&s;cape God's ju&s;t Cha&s;ti&s;ements &amp; Judg|ments for Sin, is &s;et forth by his cha&s;ti&s;ing even the Heathen, who did not &s;in again&s;t that Light, or again&s;t &s;o great Mercies, as the Wicked in I&s;rael did; nor had ever made &s;uch a Profe&s;&s;ion as they. 6. We may ob|&s;erve, that this dreadful Di&s;ea&s;e is a&s;cribed to Mankind in general. "The Lord knoweth the Thoughts of Man, that they are vanity." The P&s;almi&s;t had been &s;etting forth the vanity and unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the Thoughts of &s;ome of the Children of Men; and im|mediately upon it ob&s;erves, that this vanity and fool|i&s;hne&s;s of Thought is common and natural to Man|kind.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE. THERE is an extreme and bruti&s;h Blindne&s;s in Things of Religion, which naturally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Hearts of Mankind.</HEAD>
<P>This Doctrine is not to be under&s;tood as any Re|flection on the Capacity of the human Nature; for God hath made Man with a noble and excellent Ca|pacity. The Blindne&s;s I &s;peak of, is not a merely negative Ignorance; &s;uch as is in Trees and Stones, that know nothing. And no wonder; for they have no Faculties of Under&s;tanding and Perception, whereby they &s;hould be capable of any Knowledge. And &s;uch as is in inferior Animals, who tho' they have &s;en&s;itive Perception, yet are not capable of any intellectual Views. There is no fault to be found with Man's na|tural Faculties. God has given Men tho&s;e Faculties that are very noble and excellent; well capable of true Wi&s;dom and divine Knowledge.</P>
<P>Nor is the blindne&s;s I &s;peak of meerly negative, in the manner in which the Ignorance of a new-born In|fant is &s;o. Tho' this dont ari&s;e from want of Facul|ties; yet it ari&s;es from want of nece&s;&s;ary Opportunity to exert the&s;e Faculties.</P>
<P>The blindne&s;s that is in the Heart of Man, which is &s;poken of in the Text and Doctrine; is neither for want of Faculties, nor opportunity to know; but from &s;ome po&s;itive Cau&s;e. There is a po&s;itive Principle in the Heart, of a blinding &amp; be&s;otting Nature, that hinders &s;uch Exerci&s;es of his Faculties about the things of Re|ligion, as God has made them well capable of, and gives him abundant Opportunity for. There is a Principle which may be called, a po&s;itive Principle of Ignorance and Blindne&s;s; a Pronene&s;s or Inclination in the Heart of Man to &s;uch &s;otti&s;hne&s;s in the&s;e great things.</P>

<P N="1">1. It appears in the gro&s;sne&s;s of that Ignorance and tho&s;e Delu&s;ions, which have appeared among Mankind. Man has Faculties given him whereby he is well capa|ble of arguing the being of the Creator, from the Creatures: For the invi&s;ible things of God are very plainly and clearly to be &s;een by the things that are made: and the Perfections of the Divine Being, his eternal Power and God-head, are very manife&s;t in the Works of his Hands. And yet gro&s;ly ab&s;urd Notions concerning the God-head have prevailed in the World. In&s;tead of acknowledging and wor&s;hiping the true GOD, they have fallen off to the wor&s;hip of Idols. In &s;tead of acknowledging the one only true GOD, they have made a Multitude of Deities. In&s;tead of wor&s;hiping a GOD, who is an Almighty, infinite, alwi&s;e and holy Spirit, they have wor&s;hiped the Ho&s;ts of Heaven, the Sun, Moon and Stars; and the Works of their own Hands, Images of Gold &amp; Silver, Bra&s;s and Iron, Wood and Stone; Things without Life; Gods that can neither hear nor &s;ee, nor walk, nor &s;peak, nor do, nor know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any thing.

elegantly repre&s;ented by the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah. The Smith with the Tongs both worketh in the Coals, and fa&s;hioneth it with Hammers, and worketh it with the Strength of his Arms.

The Carpenter &s;tretcheth out his Rule: he marketh it out with a Line: he fitteth it with Planes, and he marketh it out with the Compa&s;s, and maketh it after the Figure of a Man, according to the beauty of a Man, that it may remain in the Hou&s;e.

<P><PB N="64" REF="009961_0177_0F7B3E23466596A8">Many of the Images which the Heathen wor&s;hiped were made in the mo&s;t mon&s;trous and terrible Shapes they could devi&s;e; and the more hideous and fright|ful they appeared, the better they &s;uppo&s;ed they would &s;erve their turn for gods. Some of their Ima|ges were made &s;o as to be the mo&s;t unclean Repre&s;en|tations; Images of Men openly expo&s;ing their Naked|ne&s;s. The&s;e unclean Images they judged appear'd in a godlike manner, and worthy to be wor&s;hiped.</P>
<P>Many, in&s;tead of wor&s;hiping a holy and good God, and infinitely perfect Being, a&s;cribed many Vices to many of the Gods which they wor&s;hiped. One god they reckoned notorious for Drunkenne&s;s; others no|torious for Uncleanne&s;s: to others, they a&s;cribed Ly|ing and Stealing; to others Cruelty; and yet looked upon them worthy to be wor&s;hiped as Gods.</P>
<P>Many wor&s;hiped Devils, who appeared to them; which they them&s;elves reckoned to be evil Spirits: but yet built Temples to them, and offered Sacrifices to them, becau&s;e they were afraid of them.</P>
<P>Many wor&s;hiped Bea&s;ts and Birds and Fi&s;hes; and the mo&s;t hateful and loath&s;om Animals were mo&s;t wor|&s;hiped, as particularly Serpents were more commonly wor&s;hiped, then any other Bea&s;t.

<P>And &s;o far has that Principle of Blindne&s;s with re&s;|pect to the things of Religion prevailed, that it has in a great Mea&s;ure extingui&s;hed all Light in the Minds of many, even in Matters of Morality and Civility, and things that have but a di&s;tant Relation to Religion. So that many whole Nations have profe&s;&s;edly approved of many things directly contrary to the Light of Na|ture; and the mo&s;t horrid Vices and Immoralities have been e&s;teemed harmle&s;s, yea accounted Virtues among them: &s;uch as Revenge, Cruelty and Ince&s;t. Many
<PB N="65" REF="009961_0178_0F7B3E24DF03ED18">
Nations have openly allowed the Practice of Sodomy. And with &s;ome it has been accounted commendable to marry their neare&s;t Relations. Many have even wor|&s;hiped their gods in their Temples with Acts of Drun|kenne&s;s and Whoredom, and the mo&s;t abominable Lewdne&s;s. And the more filthy they were in their Uncleanne&s;s; they thought their gods the more plea|&s;ed and delighted with it.</P>
<P>Many Nations have been &s;o under the Influence of this blindne&s;s of Mind which we are now &s;peaking of&punc; that they have been void of all Civility, and have been reduced to a State very little above the Bea&s;ts in their common Cu&s;toms, and ordinary way of living; and in a great many Things far below the Bea&s;ts: being, if I may &s;o &s;peak, much more bea&s;tly than the Bea&s;ts them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Now this has not been, becau&s;e the&s;e Men and Na|tions, with whom this has been the Ca&s;e, have not had the &s;ame Faculties that we have. That we be not as ignorant as they, is not becau&s;e we have better natural Under&s;tandings, or that our Minds are by Nature more clear, and Eyes more di&s;cerning; or that our Hearts be not naturally &s;o inclined to Sotti&s;hne&s;s &amp; Delu&s;ion as their's. But only becau&s;e God has not left us &s;o much to our &s;elves, as he has them. He has given us more In&s;truction to help us again&s;t our Delu&s;ions. GOD has &s;o ordered it in his Providence, that we &s;hould have his good Word to in&s;truct us; and has cau&s;ed that we &s;hould grow up from our Infancy in chri&s;tian In&s;truction.</P>
<P N="2">2. The extreme blindne&s;s and &s;otti&s;hne&s;s in things of Religion, which is naturally in the Hearts of Men, appears not only in embracing and profe&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Errors that are very great, but al&s;o tho&s;e that are &s;o unnatural. They have not only embraced Errors which are very contrary to Truth, but very contrary to Humanity: not only again&s;t the Light of Nature, but again&s;t the more innocent Inclinations of Nature.
<PB N="66" REF="009961_0179_0F7B3E2577EED518">
Such has been, and is the blindne&s;s of many Nations in the World, that they embrace tho&s;e Errors which do not only exclude all true Vertue, all holy Di&s;po&s;itions; but tho&s;e that have &s;wallowed up the more harmle&s;s Inclinations of human Nature. Their blindne&s;s has led them to many things that are mo&s;t unnatural, and what the very Nature of Man by its more innocent tendency, &s;eems to &s;hrink at exceedingly.</P>
<P>Thus they have embraced many gro&s;s Delu&s;ions, that are as contrary as po&s;&s;ible to natural Affection. Such as offering up their own Children in Sacrifice to their Idol; which has been a common thing in the heathen World. And the Parents have not only offered them up to Death; but they have brought them, and offer'd them up to the mo&s;t cruel and tormenting Deaths: as to be burnt alive: to be &s;calded to Death in burn|ing Bra&s;s: which was the Way of offering up Children to Moloch. The Image of the Idol being made of Bra&s;s, in a horrid &s;hape, was heat red hot; and the poor Child was laid naked in this burning Bra&s;s, and &s;o burnt to Death. And the Parents them&s;elves brought the Child to this offering&punc; however &s;weet and plea&s;ant a Child it might be. And thus the innocent Child was tormented till it died, without any regard to it's piteous Cries. And it has been the manner of &s;ome Nations, to offer in Sacrifice the faire&s;t and likelie&s;t, and be&s;t beloved Child that they had. And thus many Thou|&s;ands of poor Babes have been offer'd up. So &s;trong has been the tendency of the Hearts of Men to Delu|&s;ion, that it has thus overcome tho&s;e &s;trong natural Affections which Men have to the Fruit of their own Bodies.</P>
<P>And many of the Delu&s;ions which Men have em|braced, have been again&s;t Nature al&s;o, as they have been again&s;t Men's natural Love of their own Ea&s;e, and aver&s;ion to Pain. Many have wor&s;hiped their I|dols, and do &s;o to this Day, with &s;uch Rites as are mo&s;t
<PB N="67" REF="009961_0180_0F7B3E2D6ED2D4E8">
painful and tormenting: cutting and ga&s;hing, and mang|ling, their own Fle&s;h. Thus they &s;otti&s;hly wor&s;hip|ed Baal of old. "And they cried aloud, and cut them|&s;elves after their manner with Knives and Lancets, till the Blood gu&s;hed out upon them."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 King, xviii 28.</NOTE> And it is &s;till the Cu&s;tom in &s;ome Nations grievou&s;ly to torment them|&s;elves&punc; to kindle a Fire to &s;corch their own Bodies in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable manner: and to put them&s;elves to various and long continued Torments to plea&s;e their Idols. And it is the manner in &s;ome Nations for ma|ny, on &s;ome Occa&s;ions, to kill them&s;elves: yea, to put them&s;elves to cruel Deaths, to ca&s;t them&s;elves into great Fires, and there burn them&s;elves to Death. How &s;trong mu&s;t be the Delu&s;ions of Men's Minds, and how &s;trong the tendency of the Heart of Man to Delu&s;ion, to carry them &s;uch a Length, and &s;o to overcome &s;uch &s;trong Inclinations of human Nature!</P>
<P N="3">3. The extreme blindne&s;s of the Mind of Man will appear further, if we con&s;ider how general gro&s;s Igno|rance and Delu&s;ion has been. It has for the mo&s;t part prevailed through the greater Part of the World For mo&s;t of the time from <HI>Noah's</HI> Flood to the coming of Chri&s;t, all Nations, except the Children of I&s;rael, were over&s;pread with gro&s;s heatheni&s;h Darkne&s;s; being given up to the mo&s;t vain and ridiculous Notions, and all manner of Super&s;titious, barbarous, ab&s;urd and unna|tural Practices. And for the bigger Part of the time &s;ince that, the much greater Part of the Nations of the World, have been covered with gro&s;s Darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is &s;o at this Day. Many Nations are under po|pi&s;h Darkne&s;s, and are in &s;uch gro&s;s Delu&s;ions that they wor&s;hip the Virgin Mary, and a great Multitude of dead Men, whom their Church has canonized for Saints: &s;ome real Saints, and others abominably wicked Men. So they wor&s;hip the Bread in the Sacrament, and ac|count
<PB N="68" REF="009961_0181_0F7B3E2E41260970">
it not only the real Body of Chri&s;t, but real Chri&s;t in Body and Soul, and Divinity. They carry a Wafer, a &s;mall piece of Bread in Proce&s;&s;ion, and fall down before it and adore it, and account it Chri&s;t him|&s;elf, both in his divine and human Nature: and yet believe that the Body of Chri&s;t is in Heaven, and in ten thou&s;and different Places on Earth at the &s;ame time. They think they can do Works of Supererogation: that is, more good Works than they are obliged to do, whereby they bring God into Debt to them. They whip them&s;elves, and put them&s;elves to other ridicu|lous Penances and Sufferings, whereby they think they appea&s;e the Anger of GOD for their Sins. And they pay Money to the Prie&s;ts, to buy the Pardon of their Sins: yea, they buy Indulgencies for future Crimes, or Pardon for Sins before they commit them. They think they defend them&s;elves from evil Spirits, by &s;prinkling holy Water. They pay Money to buy the Souls of their departed Friends out of Purgatory: They wor&s;hip the Relicks of dead Saints; &s;uch as pieces of their Bones, their Teeth, their Hair, pieces of their Garments, and the like. And innumerable other &s;uch fooli&s;h Delu&s;ions they are under.</P>
<P>A great Part of the Nations of the World are Ma|hometans: many of the Articles of who&s;e Belief are too childi&s;h and ridiculous to be publickly mentioned in a &s;olemn A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>But the bigger Part of the Inhabitants of the World are to this Day gro&s;s, barbarous Heathens, who have not the Knowledge of the true GOD, but wor&s;hip Idols and Devils, with all manner of ab&s;urd &amp; fooli&s;h Rites and Ceremonies; and are de&s;titute of even com|mon Civility: Multitudes of Nations being like Bea&s;ts in human Shape.</P>
<P>Now this barbarous Ignorance and gro&s;s Delu&s;ion, being of &s;uch great extent and continuance; of &s;uch extent thro' &s;o many Ages, even the bigger part of the
<PB N="69" REF="009961_0182_0F7B3E2E80A5CD50">
Time from <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood to this Day, &s;hews the Cau&s;e is general, and the defect is in the corrupt Nature of Mankind; and the natural blindne&s;s of Man's Mind, and pronene&s;s of his Heart to Delu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="4">4. The &s;otti&s;h blindne&s;s and folly of the Heart of Men appears in their being &s;o prone to fall into &s;uch gro&s;s Delu&s;ions, &s;oon after they have been favoured with clear Light. Were not the Minds of Men exceeding dark, they never would entertain &s;uch ab&s;urd Notions at all; for they are as contrary as po&s;&s;ible to Rea&s;on: Much le&s;s would they fall into them, after they had once been in&s;tructed in the Truth. For were it not for very &s;trange &s;otti&s;hne&s;s indeed, they would, when they come to be informed of the Truth, and had Op|portunity to compare it with tho&s;e gro&s;s Errors, &s;o plainly &s;ee the difference; they would &s;ee &s;uch a Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s in the Truth, and &s;uch Ab&s;urdity in tho&s;e Errors, that they would never be in danger of being deluded by them any more. But yet &s;o it is; Mankind, after they have been fully in&s;tructed, and have lived in clear Light, have time after time, pre&s;ently lo&s;t the Know|ledge of the Truth, and have exchanged it for the mo&s;t barbarous and bruti&s;h Notions.</P>
<P>So it was &s;oon after the Flood, whereby the wicked World, tho&s;e that were vi&s;ibly &s;o, were de&s;troyed: and none were left but tho&s;e who profe&s;s'd the true Religion: And they had &s;uch an eminently holy Man as <HI>Noah</HI> to in&s;truct them. And tho' the true GOD had &s;o wonderfully and a&s;toni&s;hingly manife&s;ted him|&s;elf in that great Work of Vengeance again&s;t his Ene|mies, his de&s;troying the old World: yet the Po&s;terity of <HI>Noah,</HI> great part of them, pre&s;ently lo&s;t the Know|ledge of the true GOD, and fell away to Idolatry; and that even while <HI>Noah</HI> was living. And the An|ce&s;tors of <HI>Abraham</HI> were tainted with that Idolatry: and even <HI>Terah</HI> his own Father. "And Jo&s;hua &s;aid

<P>And even many of the Po&s;terity of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac, Abraham</HI>'s Po&s;terity by <HI>Hagar</HI> and <HI>Keturah,</HI> and that part of <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Po&s;terity which were of <HI>E&s;au,</HI> tho' the true Religion was &s;o thoroughly taught and practi&s;ed in the Hou&s;es of tho&s;e holy Patriarchs, and God had from time to time &s;o wonderfully and mira|culou&s;ly manife&s;ted him&s;elf to them, yet &s;oon ca&s;t off the true GOD, and fell away to Idolatry. For not very long after we read of the Po&s;terity of <HI>Jacob</HI> as being the only People of God, that he had in all the Earth.</P>
<P>And &s;o the People of that Part of the Land of Canaan, that were under that holy King Melchizedeck, &s;oon totally ca&s;t off the wor&s;hip of the one only true GOD, which he taught and maintained. For before <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> brought in the Children of I&s;rael, the Inhabi|tants of that Land were wholly given to Idolatry. So the People of the Land of <HI>Uz,</HI> who were under the Government of &s;o great and holy a Man as <HI>Job,</HI> &s;oon lo&s;t the Knowledge of the true GOD, and all tho&s;e reli|gious Truths which were then known among them, and &s;unk into gro&s;s Idolatry.</P>
<P>So the Po&s;terity of <HI>Jacob</HI> them&s;elves, tho' God had manife&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o to them, and had wrought &s;uch Wonders for them in <HI>Jacob</HI>'s and <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s time; yet pre&s;ently fell to wor&s;hiping the gods of Egypt. This

appears from the Words of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> "Put away the gods which your Fathers &s;erved on the other Side of the Flood, <HI>and in Egypt.</HI>"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. xxiv. 14.</NOTE> And how &s;oon did they fall to wor&s;hiping a golden Calf in the Wilderne&s;s, in the mid&s;t of the wonderful and miraculous Manife&s;ta|tions of the one only true GOD! And notwith|&s;tanding Idolatry was &s;o &s;trictly forbidden, and the Folly and Wickedne&s;s of it &s;o clearly manife&s;ted in the Law of Mo&s;es and in God's Providence; and it was &s;o much guarded again&s;t every way in the Revelation given them, and the whole of God's Conduct towards them; yet how &s;oon did they fall into Idolatry after they were brought into the Land of Canaan! And when God rai&s;ed up eminent Men, Judges to in&s;truct and govern them, and reclaim them from their idola|trous Practices, from time to time; and they profe&s;&s;ed to be convinced of their Delu&s;ion and Folly, and to repent; yet they would &s;oon fall away again into the mo&s;t &s;otti&s;h Idolatry. And this they did &s;oon after &s;uch great Light as they enjoyed in <HI>Samuel</HI>'s, <HI>David</HI>'s and <HI>Solomon</HI>'s time. And &s;o they did from time to time down to the Babyloni&s;h Captivity.</P>
<P>And in the Apo&s;tles times, when &s;uch great things were done to rou&s;e the Attention of Mankind, and &s;uch great Light was &s;pread over many Nations, Multitudes, after they had been in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian Religion by the Apo&s;tles and others, fell away into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Here&s;ies, and embraced the mo&s;t corrupt and ab&s;urd Notions.</P>
<P>After the roman Empire had been converted from Heatheni&s;m to Chri&s;tianity, and the Light of the Go&s;|pel had driven out the &s;otti&s;h Ignorance, and gro&s;s Ab|&s;urdities of pagan Idolatry, in which they had conti|nued &s;o long; they &s;oon begun to fall away again from the Truth into Antichri&s;tian Super&s;tition and Idolatry, in which are Opinions and Practices no le&s;s ab&s;urd than

tho&s;e of the Heathen. And a great Part of the chri&s;ti|an World fell away to Mahometi&s;m.</P>
<P>And &s;ince the Reformation, wherein GOD won|derfully re&s;tored Go&s;pel Light in a great Part of the chri&s;tian World, which was not but about two hundred Years ago, many are fallen away again, &s;ome to Pope|ry, and &s;ome to gro&s;s Here&s;ies, and &s;ome to athei&s;tical Principles: &s;o that the reformed Church is greatly dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>And our Nation in particular, which has been a Nation favoured with Light, &s;ince the Reformation, above mo&s;t, if not any in the World; how &s;oon has it in great Part fallen away! A great Part of it to Athei&s;m and Dei&s;m, to gro&s;s Infidelity; and others to Arminiani&s;m, and to the Socinian and Arian Here&s;ies, to believe that Chri&s;t is a created dependent God; and to hold other fooli&s;h Ab&s;urdities! And many have of late openly di&s;puted and denied the moral Evil of &s;ome of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t heinous Vices.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things &s;hew how de&s;perately prone Man|kind are to Blindne&s;s and Delu&s;ion, how addicted they are to Darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>GOD now and then, by his In&s;tructions, lifts &s;ome Nations out of &s;uch gro&s;s Darkne&s;s: but then, how do they &s;ink down into it again, as &s;oon as his Hand is withdrawn! like an heavy Stone, which tho' it may be forced upwards by Strength of Hand; yet, if it be let go, &s;inks down again: and will continue to &s;ink lower and lower with a &s;wift progre&s;s, if no &s;top be put to it, if there be nothing without to re&s;train it: There is a &s;trong bent that Way. That is the tendency of the Mind of Man &s;ince the Fall, notwith&s;tanding his noble Powers and Faculties, to &s;ink down into a kind of Brutality, to loo&s;e and extingui&s;h all u&s;eful Light, and to gather darkne&s;s: and to &s;ink lower and lower into darkne&s;s.</P>

<P>_I Have undertaken to &s;hew, how manife&s;t this is in tho&s;e things that appear in Men's open Profe&s;&s;ion. In order to this, I have already con&s;idered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Particulars.</P>
<P>I now proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="6">6. The de&s;peratene&s;s of that blindne&s;s which is in the Heart of Man appears in that no Nation or Peo|ple in the World, ever have had any Remedy or De|liverance from &s;uch gro&s;s Ignorance and Delu&s;ion, from them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="009961_0188_0F7B3E3301DE2E10">There is no In&s;tance can be mentioned of any Peo|ple what&s;oever, who have once fallen into heatheni&s;h Darkne&s;s, or any other gro&s;s Supe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;titions and ridicu|lous Opinions in Religion, that ever had any Remedy by any Wi&s;dom of their own: or that have of them|&s;elves bethought them&s;elves, and grown wi&s;er by the improvement of their own Faculties, and by in&s;truct|ing one another: or that ever had any Remedy at all, by the teaching of any wi&s;e Men, who did not pro|fe&s;&s;edly act, not as of them&s;elves, but as moved and di|rected of God; and did not declare, that they had their In&s;tructions in the fir&s;t Place from him.</P>
<P>Thus in the heathen World: Before Chri&s;t's time the whole World excepting the Jews, lay in their Darkne&s;s for a great many Hundred Years, even time out of Mind, beyond all Time that they had any certain Hi&s;tory of among them. And there was no remedy, nor appearance of any Remedy: but &s;o they continued Ages after Ages, rather waxing wor&s;e and wor&s;e, &s;inking deeper and deeper. Among all the many Nations that were in the World, no one ever be-thought them&s;elves, and emerged out of their bru|ti&s;h Darkne&s;s. There were &s;ome Nations in that time that emerged out of Slavery to other Nations, and ca&s;t off the Yoke of their Enemies, and grew great and conquered great Part of the World: but never conquered the blindne&s;s of their own Hearts.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome Nations that excelled in other Knowledge: The Greeks and Romans did &s;o. They excelled in Policy, and in the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m of their civil Go|vernment. They had wi&s;e politic Rulers: They had excellent civil Laws for regulating their civil State: many of which have been look'd upon, and imitated as a Pattern by many chri&s;tian Nations &s;ince. They excelled many other Nations in Arts and Government and Civility, almo&s;t as much as Men do Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Yet they never could deliver them&s;elves from their
<PB N="76" REF="009961_0189_0F7B3E3709BEFEC0">
heatheni&s;m. Tho' they were &s;o wi&s;e in other things, yet in Matters of Religion they were very ab&s;urd and bruti&s;h. For even the Greeks and Romans in their mo&s;t flouri&s;hing State, wor&s;hiped innumerable gods: and &s;ome to whom they a&s;cribed great Vices: and &s;ome they wor&s;hiped with mo&s;t ob&s;cene and horrid Rites. To &s;ome they offer'd human Sacrifices. The Romans had a Temple dedicated to the Furies, which they wor&s;hiped as a God. And they had a Multitude of childi&s;h Notions and Fables about their gods.</P>
<P>And tho' there were rai&s;ed up &s;ome wi&s;e Men and Philo&s;ophers among the Greeks and Romans, who bor|rowed &s;ome things concerning the true GOD from the Jews; yet their In&s;tructions never were effectual to deliver any one People, or even one City or Town, from their barbarous Heatheni&s;m, or &s;o much as to get any one Society or Company of Men to unite in the pub|lick Wor&s;hip of the true GOD. And the&s;e Philo&s;ophers them&s;elves had many gro&s;ly ab&s;urd Opinions mingled with tho&s;e &s;craps of Truth, which they had gathered up.</P>
<P>And the Jews, when they fell away to Idolatry, as they often did, never recovered of them&s;elves. Never any Remedy appeared, unle&s;s God rai&s;ed up, and ex|traordinarily moved &s;ome Per&s;on to reprove and in|&s;truct them.</P>
<P>And in this Age of Knowledge, an Age wherein Learning is carried to &s;uch a great height, even many learned Men &s;eem really to be carried away with the gro&s;s Errors and Fooleries of the popi&s;h Religion.</P>
<P>Europe is a Part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the World the mo&s;t famed for Civility, and for Arts and Sciences of any: and the&s;e things have been carried to a much greater height in this Age, than in many others: yet many learned Men in Europe at this Day, who do greatly excell in human Arts and Literature, are &s;till under popi&s;h darkne&s;s A deceived Heart has turned them a&s;ide: nor do they &s;eem to have any Power to deliver their

Souls: nor does it come into their Minds, that there is a Lie in their right Hands.</P>
<P>Many Men in <HI>France</HI> and other Countries, who are indeed Men of va&s;t Learning and Knowledge, and great Abilities, yet &s;eem really to think that the Church of Rome is the only true Church of Chri&s;t; and are zealous to uphold and propagate it. And tho' now within this hundred Years, human Learning has been very much promoted, and ri&s;en to a greater height than ever in the World: and has greatly increa&s;ed not only in our Nation, but in France and Italy, and other popi&s;h Countries: yet there &s;eems to be no &s;uch effect of it, as any con&s;iderable turning from popi&s;h Delu&s;i|ons; but the Church of Rome has rather increa&s;ed of late, than otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>And in <HI>England,</HI> a Land wherein Learning flouri&s;hes as much as in any in the World, and which is perhaps the mo&s;t favoured with Light of any; there are many Men of va&s;t Learning, and great &amp; &s;trong Rea&s;on, who have embraced, and do at this Day, embrace the gro&s;s Er|rors of the Arians &amp; Dei&s;ts. Our Nation, in all its Light and Learning, is full of Infidels, and tho&s;e that are further from Chri&s;tianity, than the very Mahometans them&s;elves. Of &s;o little avail is human Strength, and human Rea&s;on and Learning, as a Remedy again&s;t the extreme blindne&s;s of the Mind of Man. The blind|ne&s;s of the Mind of Man, or an Inclination to Delu|&s;ion in Things of Religion is &s;o &s;trong, that it will overcome the greate&s;t Learning, and the &s;tronge&s;t na|tural Rea&s;on, and as it were, &s;wallow up the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>Men, if let alone, will not help one another: nor will they help them&s;elves. The Di&s;ea&s;e always proves without Remedy, unle&s;s God delivers. This was ob|&s;erved of old: <HI>And none con&s;idereth in his Heart, neither is there Knowledge nor Under&s;tanding to &s;ay, I have burnt Part of it in the Fire, yea al&s;o I have baked Bread upon the Coals thereof: I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;ted Fle&s;h and eaten of it, and &s;hall I make the re&s;idue

<P>If God lets Men alone, no Light ari&s;es: but the Darkne&s;s grows thicker and thicker. How is it now at this Day among all the Nations where the Light of the Go&s;pel has not come? Many of who&s;e Ance&s;tors, without doubt, have been in the mid-night Darkne&s;s of Heatheni&s;m for above three thou&s;and Years: and not one People have delivered them&s;elves, who have not had the Light of the Go&s;pel. And this is not ow|ing to their want of as good natural Abilities as we have: nor is it becau&s;e they have an Inclination more to neglect their natural Abilities, or make a wor&s;e Improvement of them than we.</P>
<P N="7">7. The extreme blindne&s;s of Man's Heart in Mat|ters of Religion appears by Men's falling into gro&s;s Delu&s;ions, or continuing in them, at the &s;ame time that they have been under great Means of In&s;truction from GOD.</P>
<P>We have many In&s;tances of this. <HI>Rachel</HI> in <HI>Ja|cob's</HI> Family&mdash;The I&s;raelites in the Wilderne&s;s. They had great Means of In&s;truction, yet &s;et up the golden Calf &amp;c.

<P>In Chri&s;t's and the Apo&s;tles times the Jews had great Means of In&s;truction, and mo&s;t of the Nations of the World were put under great Advantages to come to the Knowledge of the Truth: Yet&mdash;</P>

<P>The Dei&s;ts and Arians in our Day &mdash;</P>
<P N="8">8. The exceeding blindne&s;s of Men in things of Religion appears in the endle&s;s Di&s;putes and Contro|ver&s;ies, that there have been, and are, among Men, about tho&s;e things which concern Religion.</P>
<P>Of old the wi&s;e Men and Phil&s;ophers among the Heathen, were, as it were, infinitely divided among them&s;elves. <HI>Varro,</HI> who was one of them, reckons up &s;everal hundred Opinions that they had about that one Point, <HI>Wherein Man's happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted.</HI> And they were continually in Di&s;putes one with another. But the Effects of their Di&s;putes was not any greater U|nion or any better Agreement in their Opinions. They were as much divided after they had di&s;puted many Ages, as they were at fir&s;t: yea much more.</P>
<P>So there have long been Di&s;putes in the chri&s;tian World about Opinions and Principles in Religion. There is a va&s;t variety of Sects and Opinions; and Di&s;putes have been carried on, Age after Age, with great warmth, and thou&s;ands of Volumes have been written one again&s;t another. And all the&s;e Di&s;putes have not terminated the Differences that have been, but they &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;till as much as ever: yea, they increa&s;e and multiply more and more. In &s;tead of ending Controver&s;ies by di&s;puting, they do but increa&s;e them: one Di&s;pute only lays a Foundation for ano|ther. And thus the World goes on jangling and con|tending, daily writing and printing; being, as it were, de|luged with controver&s;ial Books: and all to no Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The increa&s;e of human Learning don't bring the&s;e Controve&s;ies to an I&s;&s;ue, but does really increa&s;e and multiply them; as is evident in this learned Age, and in our Nation, where Learning has lately been carried to a very great height. There probably never

was a Time in our Nation wherein there was &s;uch a va&s;t variety of Opinions in Matters of Religion, as at this Day. Every now and then, a new Scheme of things is broached, and various and contrary O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inions are mixed and jumbled, divided and &s;ubdivided: And every new Writer is willing to have the credit of &s;ome new Notion.</P>
<P>And after this Manner does this mi&s;erable World go on in endle&s;s Confu&s;ion; like a great Multitude of fool-hardy Per&s;ons, who go on in the dark, &s;tumbling and ju&s;tling one again&s;t another, without perceiving any Remedy for their own, or affording any for their Neighbour's Calamity.</P>
<P>Thus I have &s;hewn how the extreme blindne&s;s that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Hearts of Men is manife&s;t in what ap|pears in their Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I come now,</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;hew, how this is manife&s;t in tho&s;e Things that are found by inward Experience, and are vi&s;ible in Men's Practices under the Light of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="1">1. This appears in their being &s;o prone to be de|ceived &s;o many Ways, or being liable to &s;uch a multi|plicity of Deceits. There are Thou&s;ands of Delu&s;ions in things which concern the Affairs of Religion, that Men commonly are led away with, who yet live under the Light of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>They are many ways deceived about GOD. They think him to be an exceeding diver&s;e kind of Being from what he is. They think him to be altogether &s;uch an one as them&s;elves.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. l. 21.</NOTE> They are deceived about his Holine&s;s, they don't realize it, that he is &s;uch a holy Being as he indeed is: or that he hates Sin with &s;uch an hatred as he declares he does. They are not convinced of his Truth, or that he certainly will fulfil his Threat|nings or his Promi&s;es.&mdash;They are not convinced of his Ju&s;tice in puni&s;hing Sin, as he does.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="009961_0194_0F7B3E3D791DF2C0">They have very wrong Notions of Chri&s;t.

<P>They commonly are &s;ubject to a great many Errors about their Duty. They are ready to bring their Principles to agree with their Practices, in &s;tead of bringing their Practices to their Principles, as they ought to do. They will put innumerable fal&s;e Glo&s;&s;es on the Rules of God's Word, to bend them to a compli|ance with their Lu&s;ts: And &s;o they "put darkne&s;s for light, and light for darkne&s;s; bitter for &s;weet, and &s;weet for bitter."</P>
<P>They are &s;ubject to Deceits and Delu&s;ions about the Things of this World. They imagine that there is Happine&s;s and Satisfaction to be found in the Pro|fits and Plea&s;ures and Honors, which are to be had here. They believe all the deluding Flatteries and Promi&s;es of a vain World. And they will hold that Deceit and grand Delu&s;ion, <HI>That the&s;e Things are the highe&s;t Good;</HI> and will act accordingly; will choo&s;e the&s;e things for their Portion. And they will hold and practi&s;e upon that Error, That the&s;e things are o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> long Continuance, and are to be depended upon.</P>
<P>They are greatly deceived about the things of ano|ther World. They undervalue that heaven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y Glory that is promi&s;ed to the Saints; and are not much ter|rified with what they hear of the Damnation of Hell: they can't realize it, that the Torments of it are &s;o dreadful as they hear: and are very ready to imagine that they are not eternal, but will &s;ome time or other have an end.</P>
<P>They are deceived about the State of good Men. They think they are not happy, but live a melancholy Life. And they are deceived about the Wicked. They envy the State of many of them, as accounting

<P>They are &s;ubject to a thou&s;and Deceits and Delu&s;i|ons about them&s;elves. They think them&s;elves wi&s;e, when they are Fools. They are deceived about their own Hearts: they think them much better than they be. They think they &s;ee many good things in them&s;elves, when indeed there is nothing good there.

Or rather, the inward Vault of Hell, that is an Habitation of Devils and every foul Spirit. Tho&s;e things in their Hearts are highly e&s;teemed by them, which are an Abomination in the Sight of God.</P>
<P>Men are very prone to be deceived about their own State: to think them&s;elves &s;omething, when they are nothing; and to &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves "rich and increa&s;ed in Goods, and to have need of nothing; when they are wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and BLIND, and naked" They are greatly deceived about the Principles they act from. They think they are &s;incere in that in which there is no Sincerity. They think they do tho&s;e things from love to God, which they do only from love to them&s;elves. They call meer &s;peculative or natu|ral Knowledge, &s;piritual Knowledge: and put Con&s;cience for Grace; and a &s;ervile, for a child-like fear: and com|mon Affections, that are only from natural Principles, and have no abiding effect, for high Di&s;coveries, and eminent actings of Grace. Yea, 'tis common with Men to call their vicious Di&s;po&s;itions by the Name of &s;ome Vertue. They call their Anger and Malice,

<P>They are va&s;tly deceived about their own Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s. They think their Affections and Peforman|ces lovely to God, which indeed are to him as a men|&s;truous Cloth.

<P>They are greatly deceived about their own Actions and Practices. Their own Faults are &s;trangely hid from their Eyes. They live in many Ways that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery unbecoming Chri&s;tians, but yet &s;eem not to be at

all &s;en&s;ible of it. Tho&s;e evil Ways of theirs, which are very plain to others, are hid from them. Yea, tho&s;e very things, which they them&s;elves account great Faults in others, yet they will ju&s;tify them&s;elves in. Tho&s;e things for which they will be very angry with others, yet they at the &s;ame time do them&s;elves, and often times in a much higher Degree, and never once think of it. While they are zealous to pull the Mote out of their Brother's Eye, they know not that a Beam is in their own Eye.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Sins that they commit, which they are &s;en&s;i|ble are Sins, yet they are wofully deceived about.

<P>They are greatly deceived about them&s;elves, when they compare them&s;elves with others. They e&s;teem them&s;elves better than their Neighbours, who are in|deed much better than them&s;elves. They are greatly deceived about them&s;elves, when they compare them|&s;elves with GOD. They are very in&s;en&s;ible of the difference there is between God and them, and act in many things as if they thought them&s;elves his Equals; yea, as if they thought them&s;elves above him. Thus manifold are the Deceits and Delu&s;ions that Men fall into.</P>
<P N="2">2. The de&s;perate Blindne&s;s that is natural to Men, appears in their being &s;o ignorant and blind in things that are &s;o clear and plain. Thus if we con&s;ider how great GOD is, and how dreadful Sin again&s;t him mu&s;t be&punc; and how much Sin we are guilty of, and of what Importance it is that his infinite Maje&s;ty &s;hould be vin|dicated; how plain is it, that Man's Righteou&s;ne&s;s is in&s;ufficient! And yet how greatly will Men confide in it! How will they a&s;cribe more to it, than can be a&s;cri|bed to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of any, or all of the &s;inle&s;s

And yet, how hard is it thoroughly to convince Men of it! How plain is it, that eternal Mi&s;ery in Hell is infinite|ly to be dreaded? And yet how few appear to be thoroughly convinced of this! How plain is it, that Life is uncertain: and yet how much otherwi&s;e do mo&s;t Men think! How plain is it, that it is the highe&s;t Prudence in Matters of infinite Concern to improve the fir&s;t Opportunity, without tru&s;ting to another: but yet how few are convinced of this? How rea&s;o|nable is it, con&s;idering that God is a wi&s;e and ju&s;t Being, to &s;uppo&s;e that there &s;hall be a future State of Re|wards and Puni&s;hments, wherein every Man &s;hall re|ceive according to his Works? And yet, how does this &s;eem like a Dream to mo&s;t Men.</P>
<P>What can be in it &s;elf more plain and manife&s;t, and ea&s;ily to be known by us, if it were not for a &s;trange Blindne&s;s, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n We to our &s;elves, who are always with our &s;elves, never ab&s;ent from our &s;elves; always in our own View, as it were, before our own Eyes? Who have Opportunity to look into our own Hearts, and &s;ee all that pa&s;&s;es there. And yet what is there that Men are more ignorant of, than they are of them|&s;elves? There are many vitious Practices, the un|lawfulne&s;s of which is very plain; the Sins are gro&s;s, and contrary not only to the Word of God, but to the Light of Nature: and yet Men will often times plead there is no harm in &s;uch Sins: &s;uch as many Acts of gro&s;s Uncleanne&s;s: and many Acts of Fraud, Inju&s;tice and Deceitfulne&s;s; and many others that might be mentioned.</P>
<P>There is no one thing what&s;oever more plain and manife&s;t, and more demon&s;trable, than the Being of a GOD. It is manife&s;t in our &s;elves, in our own Bodies and Souls, and in every thing about us where-ever we
<PB N="86" REF="009961_0199_0F7B3E485490EC50">
turn our Eye, whether to Heaven, or to the Earth, the Air or the Seas. And yet how prone is the Heart of Man to call the Being of God into que&s;tion? So inclined is the Heart of Man to Blindne&s;s and Delu&s;ion, that it is prone to Athei&s;m it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">3. The greatne&s;s of the blindne&s;s of the Heart of Man appeas in that &s;o little a thing will deceive him, and confound his Judgment of things. A little &s;elf-intere&s;t; or only the Bait of &s;ome &s;hort Gratification of a &s;en&s;ual Appetite; or a little &s;tiring of Pa&s;&s;ion, will blind Mens Eyes, and make them argue and judge mo&s;t &s;trangely and perver&s;ely, and draw up the mo&s;t ab&s;urd Conclu&s;ions; &s;uch, as if they were indifferent, they would &s;ee to be mo&s;t unrea&s;onable.

of God's Creatures that we behold, that they have tho&s;e Properties and Qualities, which are every way propor|tion'd to their End; &s;o that they need no more, they &s;tand in need of no greater degree of Perfection, in or|der well to an&s;wer the &s;pecial u&s;e for which they &s;eem to be de&s;igned.

<P>The principal Faculty by which God has di&s;tin|gui&s;hed this noble Creature from the re&s;t, is his <HI>Un|der&s;tanding:</HI> But would God &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h Man in his creation from other Creatures, and then &s;eal up that Under&s;tanding with &s;uch an extreme blindne&s;s, as to render it u&s;ele&s;s, as to the principal Ends of it; and wholly to di&s;enable him from an&s;wering the Ends of an under&s;tanding Creature, and to make his Under|&s;tanding rather a mi&s;ery rather than a ble&s;&s;ing to him; and rendering him much more mi&s;chievous than u&s;eful?</P>
<P>Therefore, if the Scripture had not told us &s;o, yet we might &s;afely conclude, that Mankind are not now, as they were made at fir&s;t; but that they are in a fal|len State and Condition.</P>

The Dei&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> deny the Scripture to be the Word of God, and hold that there is no <HI>revealed Religion;</HI> that God has given Mankind no other Rule but his own Rea&s;on; which is &s;ufficient, without any Word or Revelation from Heaven, to give Man a right under&s;tanding of di|vine Things, and of his Duty. But how has it prov|ed in fact? How much trial has there been, whe|ther Man's Rea&s;on, without a Revelation, would be &s;ufficient or no? The whole World, excepting one Nation, had the trial from about <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s time, to the coming of Chri&s;t, about fifteen Hundred Years. And was not this long enough for a trial, whether Man's Rea&s;on alone was &s;ufficient to in&s;truct him? Tho&s;e Nations, who all that time lay in &s;uch gro&s;s dark|ne&s;s, and in &s;uch a deplorable helple&s;s Condition, had the &s;ame natural Rea&s;on that the Dei&s;ts have. And during this time, there was not only one Man, or a Succe&s;&s;ion of &s;ingle Per&s;ons that had the trial, whether their own Rea&s;on would be &s;ufficient to lead them to the Knowledge of the Truth; but all Nations, who all had the &s;ame human Faculties that we have. If human Rea&s;on is really &s;ufficient, and there be no need of any thing el&s;e, why has it ne|ver proved &s;o? Why has it never happened, that &s;o much as <HI>one</HI> Nation, or <HI>one</HI> City or Town, or <HI>one</HI> A&s;&s;embly of Men have been brought to tolerable Noti|ons of divine Things, unle&s;s it be by the Revelation contained in the Scriptures? If it were only one Na|tion that had remained in &s;uch Darkne&s;s, the trial might not be thought &s;o great; becau&s;e one particular Peo|ple might be under &s;ome Di&s;advntages, which were pe|culiar. But thus it has been with all Nations, except tho&s;e which have been favoured with the Scriptures, and in all Ages. Where is any People, who to this Day have ever delivered them&s;elves by their own Rea|&s;on, or have been delivered without Light fetch'd from
<PB N="92" REF="009961_0205_0F7B3E4DCEEAFC28">
the Scriptures, or by Means of the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>If human Rea&s;on is &s;ufficient without the Scripture, 'tis &s;trange that in the&s;e latter Ages, &s;ince Navigation has been been &s;o improved, and <HI>America</HI> and many other Parts of the World have been di&s;covered, which were before unknown; and many hundreds of Nati|ons have been found out, which the chri&s;tian World before knew nothing of: I &s;ay, 'tis very &s;trange, that among all the&s;e newly di&s;cover'd Nations, no one Na|tion has any where been found already enlightned and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of true Notions about the Divine Being and his Perfections, and free from heatheni&s;h Darkne&s;s, by vertue of that human Rea&s;on, they have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this &s;o many thou&s;and Years. The many poor, barbarous Nations here in <HI>America</HI> had the faculty of human Rea|&s;on to do what they plea&s;ed with, before the <HI>Europeans</HI> came hither, and brought over the Light of the Go&s;pel. If this human Rea&s;on alone was &s;ufficient, it is &s;trange no one People were found, in any corner of the Land, who were helped with their Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>There has been a great trial as to what Mens Rea|&s;on can do, without divine Help, in tho&s;e endle&s;s Di&s;|putes that have been maintained. If human Rea&s;on alone could help Mankind, it might be expected that the&s;e Di&s;putes would have helped them, and have put an end to Mens darkne&s;s. The heathen Philo&s;ophers had many hundreds of Years to try their Skill in this way; but all without effect.</P>
<P>That divine Revelation, which the Church of God has been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, has been in the World "as a Light &s;hining in a dark Place.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. i. 19.</NOTE> 'Tis the only Reme|dy which God has provided for the mi&s;erable, bruti&s;h blindne&s;s of Mankind: a Remedy without which, this fallen World of Mankind would have &s;unk down for ever in barbari&s;m and brutality without any Remedy.
<PB N="93" REF="009961_0206_0F7B3E4E018FB438">
It is the only means that the true God has made &s;uc|ce&s;sful in his Providence, to give the Nations of the World the Knowledge of him&s;elf; and to bring them off from the wor&s;hip of fal&s;e gods.</P>
<P>If human Rea&s;on be the only proper Means, the Means that God has de&s;igned for the enlightening of Mankind, 'tis very &s;trange that it has not been &s;uffici|ent for this, nor has an&s;wered this end in any one In|&s;tance. All the right &s;peculative knowledge of the true God, which the Dei&s;ts them&s;elves have, has been de|rived from divine Revelation&mdash;</P>
<P>How vain is it to di&s;pute again&s;t Fact, and the Ex|perience of &s;o many thou&s;and Years? And to pretend that human Rea&s;on is &s;ufficient without divine Reve|lation, when &s;o many thou&s;and years Experience, among &s;o many hundreds of Nations, of different Tempers, Circum&s;tances and Intere&s;ts, has proved the contrary? One would think that all &s;hould acknowledge, that &s;o long a time is &s;ufficient for a trial; e&s;pecially con&s;ider|ing the Mi&s;eries that the poor Nations of the World have been under all this while, for want of Light: The innumerable temporal Calamities and Mi&s;eries; &s;uch as &s;acrificing Children, and many other Cruelties to others, and even them&s;elves: be&s;ides, that eternal Per|dition, which may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Con&s;equence of &s;uch Darkne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">III. This Doctrine &s;hould make us &s;en&s;ible, how great a Mercy it is to Mankind, that God has &s;ent his own Son into the World, to be the Light of the World.</P>
<P>The Doctrine &s;hews what great need we &s;tand in of &s;ome Teacher to be &s;ent from God. And even &s;ome of the wi&s;er Men among the Heathen &s;aw the need of this. They &s;aw that they di&s;puted and jangled among them|&s;elves without coming to a &s;atisfying di&s;covery of the Truth; and hence they &s;aw the need there was of a Teacher &s;ent from Heaven; and &s;pake of &s;uch a thing. And it is a wonderful In&s;tance of divine Mercy that
<PB N="94" REF="009961_0207_0F7B3E4EE2D509B8">
God has &s;o beheld us in our low E&s;tate, as to pro|vide &s;uch a glorious Remedy. He han't only &s;ent &s;ome created Angel to in&s;truct us, but his own SON, who is in the Bo&s;om of the Father, and of the &s;ame Nature and E&s;&s;ence with him; and therefore infinitely better acquainted with him, and more &s;ufficient to teach a blind World. He has &s;ent him to be the Light of the World, as he &s;ays of him&s;elf, "I am come a Light into the World.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. xii. 46.</NOTE> When he came he brought glorious Light into the World. It was like the Day &s;pring from on high, vi&s;iting a dark World, as <HI>Zacharias</HI> ob|&s;erves. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Luk. i. 77.78.79.</NOTE> After Chri&s;t came, then the glorious Go&s;pel began to &s;pread abroad in the World into one Nation and another, delivering tho&s;e "that had &s;at in Darkne&s;s, and in the Region of the &s;hadow of Death."</P>
<P>What rea&s;on have we to rejoyce and prai&s;e God, that he has made &s;uch excellent Provi&s;ion for us; and has &s;et &s;o glorious a Sun in our Firmament, &s;uch a "Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s," after we had extingui&s;hed the Light, which at fir&s;t enlightened us; and had, as it were, brought the World into that State, in which it was when "without Form, and void, and Darkne&s;s was on the face of it". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. xii. 46.</NOTE></P>
<P>The glory of that Light which God has &s;ent into the World, is fully an&s;werable to the gro&s;sne&s;s of that Darkne&s;s which filled the World. For Chri&s;t who came to enlighten us, is Truth and Light it &s;elf, and the Fountain of all Light." "He is Light, and in him is no darkne&s;s at all. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Luk. i. 77.78.79.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">IV. Hence we may learn, what mu&s;t be the thing that will bring to pa&s;s tho&s;e glorious Days of Light, which are &s;poken of in God's Word.</P>
<P>Tho' Mankind be fallen into &s;uch Darkne&s;s, and the World is mo&s;tly in the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s: yet the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Jer. iv. 22, 23.</NOTE> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. i. 5.</NOTE>
<PB N="95" REF="009961_0208_0F7B3E52A56C0848">
Scripture often &s;peaks of a glorious Day, wherein, Light &s;hall fill the Earth. "For behold the darkne&s;s &s;hall cover the Earth, and gro&s;s darkne&s;s the People but the Lord &s;hall ari&s;e upon thee, and his glory &s;hall be &s;een upon thee. And the Gentiles &s;hall come to thy Light, and Kings to the brightne&s;s of thy ri&s;ing."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. lx. 2, 3.</NOTE> "And he will de&s;troy in this Mountain, the face of the covering ca&s;t over all People, and the vail that is &s;pread over all Nations" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. lx. 2, 3.</NOTE> "The knowledge of God &s;hall fill the Earth, as the Waters cover the Seas"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. xxv. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>By what we have heard, we may on good Grounds conclude that whenever this is accompli&s;hed, it will not be effected by human Learning, or by the &s;kill or wi&s;dom of great Men. What has been before ob&s;erved of this learned Age, is an Evidence of this; wherein &s;piritual Darkne&s;s does &s;o increa&s;e, with the increa&s;e of Learning. God will again make fooli&s;h the wi&s;dom of this World; and will, as it were, &s;ay in his Provi|dence, "Where is the wi&s;e! where is the Scribe! where is the di&s;puter of this World!"</P>
<P>When this &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, it will be by a remarkable pouring out of God's own Spirit, with the plain preaching of the Go&s;pel of his Son; the preach|ing of the &s;piritual, my&s;terious Doctrines of Chri&s;t cru|cified, which to the learned Men of this World are fooli&s;hne&s;s. By the Spirit of God accompanying the preaching of tho&s;e Doctrines, which are the &s;tumbling-Block of this learned Age. "Not by might, nor power, but by my Spirit, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. xi. 6&punc;</NOTE> It will not be by the enticing Words of Man's wi&s;dom; but by the demon&s;tration of the Spirit, and of Power. Not by the wi&s;dom of this World, nor the Princes of this World, that comes to nought: but by the Go&s;pel, that contains the wi&s;dom of God in a My&s;tery, even the hidden Wi&s;dom, which none of the Princes of this World, who have nothing to enlighten them but their own learning, know any thing of.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="009961_0209_0F7B3E53678AF490">The Spirit of God, who &s;earches all things, even the deep things of God, mu&s;t reveal it. For let natural Men be never &s;o worldly wi&s;e and learned, they re|ceive not the things of the Spirit; they are fooli&s;hne&s;s to them; nor can they know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</P>
<P>This great effect, when it is accompli&s;hed, will be a glorious effect indeed: and it will be accompli&s;hed in &s;uch a manner, as mo&s;t remarkably to &s;hew it to be the Work of God, and his only. It will be a more glorious Work of God than that which we read of in the beginning of <HI>Gene&s;is.</HI> "And the Earth was with|out form and vold, and darkne&s;s was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the Waters: And God &s;aid, Let there be light, and there was light." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen, i. 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P N="5">V. Hence we may learn the mi&s;ery of all &s;uch Per|&s;ons, as are under the Power of the darkne&s;s, which naturally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es their Hearts. There are two de|grees of this mi&s;ery.</P>
<P N="1">1. That which all that are in a natural Condition are the &s;ubjects of. The Doctrine &s;hews, that all &s;uch as are in a natural Condition, are in a mi&s;erable Con|dition; for they are in an extremely dark and blind Condition. 'Tis uncomfortable living in outward Darkne&s;s. What a &s;orrowful State &s;hould we all be in, if the Sun &s;hould no more ri&s;e upon us, and the Moon were to with-draw her &s;hining, and the Stars to be put out, and we were to &s;pend the re&s;t of our time in darkne&s;s? The World would &s;oon peri&s;h, in &s;uch Darkne&s;s. It was a great Plague in Egypt, when they had a total Darkne&s;s for three Days. Outward blind|ne&s;s is ju&s;tly looked upon as a great Calamity. They who are deprived of Sight, are deprived of the mo&s;t noble of the Sen&s;es: they have no benefit of external
<PB N="97" REF="009961_0210_0F7B3E5400755AF8">
Light, one of the mo&s;t excellent and needful of the Things which God has made in the vi&s;ible Creation. But they who are without &s;piritual Sight and Light, are de&s;titute of that which is far more excellent and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>That natural Men are not &s;en&s;ible of their blindne&s;s, and the Mi&s;ery they are under by Rea&s;on of it, is no Argument that they are not mi&s;erable. For it is very much the Nature of this Calamity to be hid from it|&s;elf, or from tho&s;e who are under it. Fools are not &s;en&s;ible of their Folly. Solomon &s;ays <Q>The Fool is wi&s;er in his own Conceit than &s;even Men that can render a Rea&s;on</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxvi. 16.</NOTE> The mo&s;t barbarous and bruti&s;h Heathen are not &s;en&s;ible of their own Dark|ne&s;s; are not &s;en&s;ible but that they enjoy as great Light, and have as good Under&s;tanding of Things, as the mo&s;t enlightned Nations in the World.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER Degree of this Mi&s;ery is of tho&s;e who are judicially given up of God, to the blindne&s;s of their own Minds. The Scripture teaches us that there are &s;ome &s;uch <Q>What then?

<P>Who the particular Per&s;ons are, that are thus judici|ally given up of God to the blindne&s;s of their Minds, is not known to Men. But we have no Rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e that there are not Multitudes of them; and mo&s;t in Places of the greate&s;t Light. There is no manner of Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that this Judgement which is &s;poken of in Scripture, is in a great Mea&s;ure peculiar to tho&s;e old Times. As there were many that fell un|der it in the Times of the Prophets of Old, and of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles; &s;o doubtle&s;s there are now a Days too. And tho' the Per&s;ons are not known, yet doubtle&s;s there may be more Rea&s;on to fear it concern|ing &s;ome than others. All that are under the Power of the blindne&s;s of their own Minds, are mi&s;erable; but &s;uch as are given up to this Blindne&s;s, are e&s;peci|ally mi&s;erable: For they are re&s;erved, and &s;ealed over to the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s for ever.</P>
<P>And the Con&s;ideration of what has been &s;aid of the de&s;perate blindne&s;s which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Hearts of all naturally, may well be terrifying to &s;uch as are yet in a Chri&s;tle&s;s Condition in this place of Light, where the Go&s;pel has been &s;o long enjoyed, and where God has in Times pa&s;t, &s;o wonderfully poured out his Spirit.</P>

<P>Let us therefore be hence warned to take heed that we be not deceived about our Duty&mdash;About our own Hearts&mdash;About our Ways&mdash;About our State&mdash;About our Opportunities&mdash;Thou&s;ands are deceived in the&s;e Things, and Thou&s;ands peri&s;h by that Means.

<P N="1">1. That we &s;hould become Fools: Be &s;en&s;ible of our own natural Blindne&s;s and Folly.

<P N="2">2. To a&s;k Wi&s;dom of God. If we are &s;o blind in our&s;elves, then Knowledge is not to be &s;ought for out of our own Stock, but mu&s;t be &s;ought from &s;ome other Source. And we have no where el&s;e to go for it, but to the Fountain of light and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>True Wi&s;dom is a precious Jewel: And none of our fellow Creatures can give it us, nor can we buy it with any Price we have to give. It is the &s;overeign Gift of God.

<P>_THE apo&s;tle, from the beginning of the e|pi&s;tle, to the beginning of this chapter, had in&s;i&s;ted on the Doctrine of Ju&s;tificati|on by faith alone. And having particular|ly &s;poken to that, in this chapter he goes on to con&s;ider the benefits that are con&s;equent on Ju&s;ti|fication. And there are three that flow from ju&s;tifica|tion, which are here &s;poken of, viz. Peace with God, Pre&s;ent happine&s;s, and Hope of glory. Peace with God is mentioned in the fir&s;t ver&s;e. "Therefore be|ing ju&s;tified by faith, <HI>we have peace with God,</HI> through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t." In the following ver&s;es he &s;peaks of pre&s;ent ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and hope of glory, as benefits accompanying Ju&s;tification. "By whom al&s;o we have acce&s;s by faith into this grace, wherein we &s;tand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</P>
<P>And concerning this benefit of the <HI>hope of glory,</HI> the apo&s;tle does particularly take notice of two things, viz. the ble&s;&s;ed nature of this hope, and the &s;ure ground of it.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="105" REF="009961_0218_0F7B3E60C4848A38">1. He in&s;i&s;ts on the ble&s;&s;ed nature of this hope, in that it enables us to glory in tribulations. This excel|lent nature of true chri&s;tian hope is de&s;cribed in the fol|lowing Words. "And not only &s;o, but we glory in tribulation al&s;o knowing that tribulation worketh pa|tience; and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope maketh not a&s;hamed, becau&s;e the love of God is &s;hed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Gho&s;t, which is given unto us.'<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 3. 4. 5.</NOTE> Q. D. Through hope of a ble&s;&s;ed reward, that will abundantly more than make up for all tribulation, we are enabled to bear tribulation with patience; patiently bearing, and patiently waiting for the reward. And patience works experience; for when we thus bear tribulation with patient waiting for the re|ward, this brings experience of the earne&s;t of the re|ward, viz. the earne&s;t of the &s;pirit, in our feeling the love of God &s;hed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Gho&s;t. So that our hope don't make us a&s;hamed; tho' we do bear tribulation, our hope is not di&s;appointed; for in the mid&s;t of our tribulation, we experience tho&s;e ble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed incomes of the &s;pirit in our &s;ouls, that make even a time of tribulation &s;weet to us; and is &s;uch an earne&s;t as abundantly confirms our hope: and &s;o expe|rience works hope.</P>
<P N="2">2. The apo&s;tle takes notice of the &s;ure and abundant ground there is for this hope; or the abundant evidence we have, that we &s;hall obtain the glory hoped for, in that peace that we have with God, in our ju&s;tification through Chri&s;t's blood; becau&s;e that while we were without &s;trength, in due time Chri&s;t died for us; while we were ungodly and &s;inners, enemies to God and Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See ver. 6&mdash;10.</NOTE> The apo&s;tle's argument is exceeding clear and &s;trong. That if God has done already &s;o great a thing for us, as to give us Chri&s;t, to die and &s;hed his precious blood for us, which was va&s;tly the greate&s;t thing, we need not doubt but that he will be&s;tow life upon us, af|ter
<PB N="106" REF="009961_0219_0F7B3E6190C2B1F8">
all this is already done. 'Tis but a &s;mall thing for God actually to be&s;tow eternal life, after it is purcha&s;ed; to what it is for him to give his own Son to die, to purcha&s;e it. The giving Chri&s;t to purcha&s;e it, was vertually all: It included the whole grace of God in &s;alvation. When Chri&s;t had purcha&s;ed &s;alvation at &s;uch a dear rate, all the difficulty was got through, all was vertually over and done. 'Tis a &s;mall thing, in compari&s;on, for God to be&s;tow &s;alvation, after it has been thus purcha&s;ed at a full price. Sinners that are ju&s;tified by the death of Chri&s;t, are already vertually &s;aved: the thing is, as it were, done: What remains, is no more than the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of what is done. Chri&s;t when he died made an end of &s;in: And when he ro&s;e from the dead, he did vertually ri&s;e with the elect: He brought them up from death with him, and a&s;cended into heaven with them. And therefore, when this is already done, and we are thus reconciled to God through the death of his &s;on, we need not fear but that we &s;hall be &s;aved by his life. The love of God appears much more in his giving his &s;on to die for &s;inners, than in giving eternal life after Chri&s;t's death.</P>
<P>The giving of Chri&s;t to die for us is here &s;poken of as a much greater thing, than the actual be&s;towment of life, on two accounts.</P>
<P N="1">1. That this is all that has any difficulty in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. When God did this for us, he did it for us, as &s;inners and enemies. But in actually be&s;towing &s;alva|tion on us after we are ju&s;tified, we are not looked up- &s;in as &s;inners. After we are ju&s;tified, God don't look on us any longer as &s;inners, but as perfectly righteous per&s;ons: he beholds no iniquity in us. We are no more enemies, for then we are reconciled. When God gave Chri&s;t to die for the elect, he looked on them as they are in them&s;elves; but in actually be&s;towing eter|nal life, he dont look on them as they are in them&s;elves, but as they are in Chri&s;t.</P>

</LIST>
<P N="1">I. I am to &s;hew, in what re&s;pects they are enemies to God.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEIR enmity appears in their judgments; in the judgment and e&s;teem they have of God. They have a very mean e&s;teem of God. Men are ready to entertain a good e&s;teem of tho&s;e with whom they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nds: They are apt to think highly of their quali|ties, to give them their due prai&s;es; and if there be de|fects, to cover them But tho&s;e to whom they are e|nemies, they are di&s;po&s;ed to have mean thoughts of; they are apt to entertain a di&s;honourable opinion of them: they will be ready to look contemptibly upon any thing that is prai&s;e-worthy in them.</P>
<P>SO is it with natural men towards God. They en|tertain very low and contemptible thoughts of God. Whatever honour and re&s;pect they may pretend and make a &s;hew of towards God, if their practice be exa|mined, it will &s;hew, that they do certainly look upon him to be a being, that is but little to be regarded. They think him one that is worthy of very little honor and re&s;pect, not worthy to be much taken notice of. The language of their hearts is, "Who is the Lord, that I &s;hould obey his voice?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. v. 2.</NOTE> "What is the Almigh|ty, that we &s;hould &s;erve him? and what profit &s;hould we have if we pray unto him?"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job. xxi. 15.</NOTE> They count him wor|thy neither to be loved nor feared. They dare not behave with that &s;light and di&s;regard towards one of their fellow creatures, but a little rai&s;ed above them in power and authority, as they dare, and do towards God. They value one of their equals much more than God, and are ten times more afraid of offending &s;uch an one, than of di&s;plea&s;ing the God that made them. They ca&s;t &s;uch exceeding contempt on God,
<PB N="109" REF="009961_0222_0F7B3E65D80DBED0">
as to prefer every vile lu&s;t before him. And every worldly enjoyment is &s;et higher in their e&s;teem, than God. A mor&s;el of meat, or a few pence of worldly gain, is preferred before him. God is &s;et la&s;t and low|e&s;t in the e&s;teem of natural men.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY are enemies in the natural reli&s;h of their &s;ouls. They have an inbred di&s;ta&s;te and di&s;reli&s;h of God's perfections. God is not &s;uch a &s;ort of being as they would have. Tho' they are ignorant of God; yet from what they hear of him, and from what is manife&s;t by the light of nature of God, they don't like him. By his being endowed with &s;uch attributes as he is, they have an aver&s;ion to him. They hear God is an infinitely holy, pure and righteous Being, and they don't like him upon this account; they have no reli&s;h of &s;uch kind of qualifications: they take no delight in contemplating them. It would be a mere ta&s;k, a bon|dage to a natural man, to be obliged to &s;et him&s;elf to contemplate the&s;e attributes of God. They &s;ee no manner of beauty or loveline&s;s, nor ta&s;te any &s;weetne&s;s in them. And upon the account of their di&s;ta&s;te of the&s;e perfections, they di&s;like all the other of his attributes. They have greater aver&s;ion to him becau&s;e he is omni|&s;cient and knows all things; becau&s;e his omni&s;cience is an holy omni&s;cience. They are not plea&s;ed that he is omnipotent, and can do whatever he plea&s;es; becau&s;e it is a holy omnipotence. They are enemies even to his mercy, becau&s;e it is a holy mercy. They do not like his immutability, becau&s;e by this he never will be otherwi&s;e than he is, an infinitely holy God.</P>
<P>'Tis from this di&s;reli&s;h that natural men have of the attributes of God, that they don't love to have much to do with God. The natural tendency of the heart of man is to fly from God, and keep at a di&s;tance from him; and to get as far off as po&s;&s;ible from God. A natural man is aver&s;e to communion with God, and is naturally di&s;inclined to tho&s;e exerci&s;es of religion, where|in
<PB N="110" REF="009961_0223_0F7B3E664EFAF600">
he has immediately to do with God. It is &s;aid of wicked men, "God is not in all his thoughts."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. x. 4.</NOTE> 'Tis evident that the mind of man is naturally aver&s;e to thinking about God: And hence if any thoughts of God be &s;ugge&s;ted to the mind, they &s;oon go away; &s;uch thoughts be not apt to re&s;t in the minds of natural men. If any thing is &s;aid to them of God, they are apt to forget it: 'tis like &s;eed that falls upon the hard path, it don't at all enter in, and the fowls of the air &s;oon catch it away: or like &s;eed that falls upon a rock. Other things will &s;tick; but divine things, do, as it were, rebound: and if they are ca&s;t into the mind, they meet with that there which &s;oon thru&s;ts them out again: they meet with no &s;uitable entertainment, but are &s;oon cha&s;ed away.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o it is that natural men are &s;o difficultly per&s;waded to be con&s;tant in the duty of &s;ecret prayer. They would not be &s;o aver&s;e to &s;pending a quarter of an hour, night and morning, in &s;ome bodily labour; but 'tis becau&s;e they are aver&s;e to a work, wherein they have &s;o immediately to do with God; and they naturally love to keep at a di&s;tance from God.</P>
<P N="3">3. THEIR wills are contrary to his will. God's will and their's, are exceeding cro&s;s the one to the o|ther. God wills tho&s;e things that they hate, and are mo&s;t aver&s;e to; and they will tho&s;e things that God hates. Hence they oppo&s;e God in their wills: they &s;et up their wills again&s;t the will of God. There is a dreadful, violent and ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition of the will of natural men to the will of God.</P>
<P>They are very oppo&s;ite to the commands of God. 'Tis from the enmity of the will, that "the carnal mind is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 7.</NOTE> Hence natural men are enemies to God's government. They are not loyal &s;ubjects, but enemies
<PB N="111" REF="009961_0224_0F7B3E66E9E43A58">
to God, con&s;idered as lord of the world. They are en|tire enemies to God's authority.</P>
<P N="4">4. THEY are enemies to God in their affections. There is in every natural man a &s;eed of malice again&s;t God: yea, there is &s;uch a &s;eed of this, rooted in the heart of man naturally. And it does often dreadfully break forth and appear. Tho' it may in a great mea|&s;ure lie hid in &s;ecure times, when God lets men alone, and they meet with no great di&s;turbance of body or mind; yet, if God does but touch men a little in their con&s;ciences, by manife&s;ting to them a little of his wrath for their &s;ins, this oft times brings out the principle of malice again&s;t God, which is exerci&s;ed in dreadful heart-ri&s;ings, inward wranglings and quarrellings, and bla&s;|phemous thoughts: wherein the heart is like a viper, hi&s;&s;ing, and &s;pitting poi&s;on at God. There is abund|ance of &s;uch a principle in the heart. And however free from it the heart may &s;eem to be, when let alone and &s;ecure, yet a very little thing will &s;et it in a rage. Temptations will &s;hew what is in the heart. The al|teration of a man's circum&s;tances will often di&s;cover the heart: a change of circum&s;tance will bring that out which was hid before. Pharaoh had no more natural enmity again&s;t God than other men; and if other natu|ral men had been in Pharaoh's circum&s;tances, the &s;ame corruptions would put forth them&s;elves in as dreadful a manner. The Scribes &amp; Phara&s;ees had naturally no more of a principle of malice in their hearts again&s;t Chri&s;t, than other men; and other natural men would, in their ca&s;e, and having as little re&s;traint, exerci&s;e as much malice again&s;t Chri&s;t as they did. When wicked men come to be ca&s;t into hell, then their malice again&s;t God will appear. Then will it appear what dreadful malice they have in their hearts. Then their hearts will appear as full of malice, as hell is full of fire. But when wicked men come to be in hell, there will be no
<PB N="112" REF="009961_0225_0F7B3E6778422920">
new corruptions put into their heart; but only old ones will then break forth without re&s;traint. That is all the difference between a wicked man on earth, and a wicked man in hell, that in hell there will be more to &s;tir up the exerci&s;e of corruption, and le&s;s to re&s;train it than on earth: but there will be no new corruption put in. A wicked man will have no principle of cor|ruption in hell, but what he carried to hell with him. There are now the &s;eeds of all the malice that will be exerci&s;ed then. The malice of damned &s;pirits is but a branch of the root, that is in the hearts of natural men now. A natural man has a heart&punc; like the heart of a devil; but only as corruption is more under re&s;traint in man than in devils.</P>

<P N="1">1. THEY have no love to God; their enmity is <HI>mere</HI> enmity without any mixture of love. A natural

man is wholly de&s;titute of any principle of love to God, and never had the lea&s;t exerci&s;e of this love. Some na|tural men have better natural tempers than others; and &s;ome are better educated than others; and &s;ome live a great deal more &s;oberly than others: but one has no more love to God than another; for none have the lea&s;t &s;park of that. The heart of a natural man is as de&s;ti|tute of love to God, as a dead, &s;tiff, cold corp&s;e is of vital heat. "I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jon. v. 43.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. EVERY faculty and principle of action is <HI>wholly</HI> under the dominion of enmity again&s;t God. The na|ture of man is wholly infected with this enmity again&s;t God. He is tainted with it throughout, in all his fa|culties and principles. And not only &s;o, but every faculty is entirely and perfectly &s;ubdued under it, and en&s;laved to it. This enmity again&s;t God, has the ab|&s;olute po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the man.

<P>The under&s;tanding is under the reigning power of this enmity again&s;t God, &s;o that it is entirely darkned and blinded with regard to the glory and excellency of God. The will is wholly under the reigning power of it. All the affections are governed by enmity again&s;t God: there is not one affection, nor one de&s;ire, that a natural man has, or that he is ever &s;tired up to act from, but that contains in it enmity again&s;t God. A natural man is as full of enmity again&s;t God, as any viper, or any venemous bea&s;t, is full of poi&s;on.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE power of the enmity of natural men again&s;t God, is &s;o great, that <HI>'tis in&s;upp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">able</HI> by any finite power. It has too great and &s;trong a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, to be overcome by any created power. Natural

men can't overcome their own enmity, let them &s;trive never &s;o much with their own hearts. Indeed, a natural man never &s;incerely &s;trives to root out his enmity a|gain&s;t God; his endeavours are hypocritical: he delights in his enmity, and choo&s;es it. Neither can others do it, tho' they &s;incerely, and to their utmo&s;t endeavour to overcome this enmity. If godly friends and neigh|bours labour to per&s;wade them to ca&s;t away their enmi|ty, and become friends to God, they can't per&s;wade them to it. Tho' mini&s;ters u&s;e never &s;o many argu|ments and entreaties, and &s;et forth the loveline&s;s of God, and tell them of the goodne&s;s of God to them, and hold forth to them God's own gracious invitations, and intreat them never &s;o earne&s;tly to ca&s;t off their op|po&s;ition and enmity, and to be reconciled, and become friends; yet they can't overcome it: &s;till they will be as bad enemies to God, as ever they were. The tongue of men or of angels can't per&s;wade them to re|linqui&s;h their oppo&s;ition to God. Miracles will not do it. How many miracles did the children of I&s;rael &s;ee in the wilderne&s;s! yet their enmity again&s;t God remain|ed; as appeared by their often murmuring. And how often did Chri&s;t u&s;e miracles to this end without effect, but the Jews yet ob&s;tinately &s;tood out. "O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, thou that kille&s;t the prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them which are &s;ent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, <HI>and ye would not.</HI>"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxiii 37.</NOTE> And how great did the enmity of the&s;e people appear to be after all; how &s;piteful and venemous were their hearts towards Chri&s;t, as appears by their cruel treatment of him, in his la&s;t &s;ufferings!</P>
<P N="4">4. THEY are <HI>mortal</HI> enemies to God; i. e. They have that enmity in their hearts, that &s;trikes at the life of God. A man may be no friend to another, and may

have an ill &s;pirit towards him; and yet not be his <HI>mor|tal</HI> enemy: his enmity will be &s;atisfied and gluted with &s;omething &s;hort of the death of the per&s;on. But it is not &s;o with natural men, with re&s;pect to God: they are <HI>mortal</HI> enemies. Indeed, natural men can't kill God. They have no hope of it, and &s;o make no attempts: It has ever been looked upon &s;o much above their power, that, it may be, it is not thought of. But that is no argument that this is not the tendency of the principle.</P>
<P>Natural men are enemies to the dominion of God; and their nature &s;hews their good will to pull him down out of heaven, and dethrone him if they could! Yea, they are enemies to the <HI>Being</HI> of God, and would be glad if there was no God. And therefore it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that they would <HI>kill him,</HI> and cau&s;e that there &s;hould be none, if they could.</P>
<P>"The fool hath &s;aid in his heart, there is no God."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xiv. 1.</NOTE> This &s;aying <HI>in his heart, There is no God,</HI> imples in it, not only an aptne&s;s to que&s;tion the Being of God; but it implies, that he <HI>inclines</HI> it &s;hould be &s;o.

The words, <HI>there is,</HI> are not in the original, but were put in by the tran&s;lators. Now if we read the words &s;o, "The fool hath &s;aid in his heart, No God," they will perhaps &s;hew the P&s;almi&s;t's meaning more fully, than as they are now tran&s;lated. "The fool hath &s;aid in his heart, <HI>No God.</HI>" That is, "I would have none, I don't de&s;ire any, I wi&s;h there was none; that would &s;uit my inclination be&s;t." That is the language of the inclinations of a natural man; no God. Let there be no God for me, let me have no God: Let the world be emptied of a God, he &s;tands in my way." And hence he is an Athei&s;t in his heart, he is ready to think there is none; and that al&s;o is ready to be the language of his heart, "There is no God."</P>

<P>The divine nature being immortal, and infinitely out of our reach, there is no other trial po&s;&s;ible, whether the enmity that is naturally in the heart again&s;t God, be mortal or no, but only for God to take on him the hu|man nature, and become man; &s;o as to come within man's reach, that they &s;hould be capable of killing him. There can be no other experiment but this. And this trial there has been. And what has been the event? Why, when once God became man, and came down to dwell here, among &s;uch vipers as fallen men, they hated him, and per&s;ecuted him; and never left 'till they had imbrued their hands in his blood. There was a mul|titude of them that appeared combined in this de&s;ign. Nothing would do, but he mu&s;t be put to death. All cry out, "Crucify him, crucify him. Away with him." They had rather Barrabbas, who greatly de&s;erved death, &s;hould live, than he &s;hould not die. Nothing would re|&s;train them from it; even all his preaching and all his miracles: but they would kill him. And it was not the ordinary kind of execution that would &s;atisfy them: but it mu&s;t be the mo&s;t cruel, and mo&s;t ignominious they po&s;&s;ibly could invent. And they in the time of it, add|ed to it, and aggravated it as much as ever they could, by mocking him, and &s;piting on him, and &s;courging him. This &s;hews what the nature and tendency of man's en|mity again&s;t God is; here it appeared in its true co|lours.</P>

There is no other being that &s;o much &s;tands in &s;inners way, in tho&s;e things that they chiefly &s;et their hearts upon, as God.

<ITEM>2. TO how great a degree they are enemies.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. WHY they are enemies.</ITEM>

<P>The two fir&s;t things propo&s;ed, have been attended to in the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e. I now proceed,</P>
<P N="3">III. TO &s;hew why, or on what account they are ene|mies to God.</P>
<P><HI>The general Rea&s;on is,</HI> That God is oppo&s;ite to them in the wor&s;hip of their idols.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tacy of man does &s;ummarily con&s;i&s;t in de|parting from the true God, to idols, for&s;aking his crea|tor, and &s;etting up other things in his room.</P>
<P>When God at fir&s;t created man, he was united to his creator; the God that made him was his God. The true God was the object of his highe&s;t re&s;pect, and had the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart. Love to God was the prin|ciple in his heart, that ruled over all other principles;
<PB N="119" REF="009961_0232_0F7B3E70AC322DB0">
and every thing in the &s;oul, was wholly in &s;ubjection to it. But when man fell, he departed from the true God, and the union that was between his heart and his crea|tor was broken: he wholly lo&s;t the principle of love he had to God. And henceforward man clave to other gods. He gave that re&s;pect to the creature, which is due to the creator. When God cea&s;ed to be the object of his &s;upream love and re&s;pect, other things of cour&s;e became the objects of it.</P>
<P>Man will nece&s;&s;arily have &s;omething that he re&s;pects as his God. If man don't give his highe&s;t re&s;pect to the God that made him, there will be &s;omething el&s;e that has the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Men will either wor&s;hip the true God, or &s;ome idol: it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e; &s;omething will have the heart of man. And that which a man gives his heart to, may be called his God: and therefore when man by the fall extin|gui&s;hed all love to the true God, he &s;et up the crea|ture in his room</P>
<P>And &s;o man came to be at enmity again&s;t the true God. For having lo&s;t his e&s;teem and love of the true God, and &s;et up other gods in his room, and in oppo&s;i|tion to him; and God &s;till demanding their wor&s;hip, and oppo&s;ing them in their wor&s;hip of tho&s;e fal&s;e gods; and man continuing &s;till to wor&s;hip idols, enmity ne|ce&s;&s;arily follows.</P>
<P>That which a man chu&s;es for his God, he &s;ets his heart mainly upon. And nothing will &s;o &s;oon excite enmity, as oppo&s;ition in that which is deare&s;t. A man will be the greate&s;t enemy to him who oppo&s;es him in what he choo&s;es for his God: he will look on none as &s;tanding &s;o much in his way, as he that would deprive him of his God. "Ye have taken away my gods; and what have I more?"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Judg. vxiii. 24.</NOTE> A man, in this re&s;pect, can't &s;erve two ma&s;ters, that &s;tand in competition to his &s;er|vice. And not only, if he &s;erves one, he cannot <HI>&s;erve</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="009961_0233_0F7B3E7194A5ACD0">
the other; but if he cleaves to one, he will nece&s;&s;arily <HI>hate</HI> the other. "No man can &s;erve two ma&s;ters; for either he will <HI>hate</HI> the one, and love the other, or el&s;e he will hold to the one, and <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI> the other. Ye can|not &s;erve God and mammon."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. vi. 24</NOTE> And this is the very rea&s;on that men hate God. In this ca&s;e it is, as when two kings &s;et up in one kingdom, in oppo&s;ition one to the other; and they both challenge the &s;ame throne, and are competitors for the &s;ame crown: they that are loyal, hearty &s;ubjects to the one, will nece&s;&s;arily be ene|mies to the other. It always happens &s;o, nor indeed can it be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>As that which is a man's God, is the object of his highe&s;t love; &s;o that God which chiefly oppo&s;es him in it, mu&s;t be the object of his greate&s;t hatred.</P>
<P>The gods which a natural man wor&s;hips, in&s;tead of the God that made him, are him&s;elf and the world. He has withdrawn his e&s;teem and honor from God, and proud|ly exalts him&s;elf. As &s;atan did: he was not willing to be in &s;uch &s;ubjection; and therefore rebelled, and &s;et up him&s;elf for God. So a natural man, in the proud and high thoughts he has of him&s;elf, &s;ets up him&s;elf upon God's throne. And he gives his heart to the world, worldly riches, and worldly plea&s;ures, and world|ly honors: they have the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that regard which is due to God. The apo&s;tle &s;ums up all the idolatry of wicked men in their <HI>love of the world.</HI> "Love not the World, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the father, but is of the world."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. ii. 15.16.</NOTE> And the apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> ob&s;erves, that a man mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the ene|my of the true God, if he be a friend of the world. "Know ye not that the friend&s;hip of the world is en|mity

with God? Who&s;oever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jam. iv.</NOTE></P>
<P>All the &s;in that men commit, is what they do in the &s;ervice of their idols: there is no one act of &s;in, but what is an act of &s;ervice to &s;ome fal&s;e God. And there|fore wherein &s;oever God oppo&s;es &s;in in them, he is op|po&s;ite to their wor&s;hip of their idols: on which account they are enemies to God.</P>
<P>God oppo&s;es them in their &s;ervice of their idols, in the following re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">1. HE manife&s;ts his utter abhorrence of their wor|&s;hip of their idols. Their idols are what they love a|bove all things: they would by no means part with them. This wickedne&s;s is <HI>&s;weet</HI> unto them.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jam. iv.</NOTE> If you take them away, what have they more? If they loo&s;e their idols, they loo&s;e their all. To rend away their idols from them, would be more grievous to them, than to rend body and &s;oul a&s;under: it is like rending their heart in twain. They love their idolatry; but God don't approve of it, but exceedingly hates it: he hates it implacably, and will by no means be reconciled to it; and therefore they hate him. God declares an infinite hatred of every act of &s;in which they do; or every act that they do in the &s;ervice of their fal&s;e gods. He ap|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oves of it in no part, but hates it all. He declares him&s;elf to be an holy God, and a jealous God; a God that is very jealous of his own honor; and that greatly abhors the giving that honor to another.</P>
<P N="2">2. HE utterly forbids their cleaving to tho&s;e idols, and all the &s;ervice that they do to them. He not only &s;hews that he di&s;likes it, but he utterly forbids it; and demands that they &s;hould wor&s;hip him, and &s;erve him only, and give their hearts wholly to him; without tole|rating any competitor. He allows them to &s;erve their idols in no degree; but requires them to ca&s;t them away <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jov. xx. 12</NOTE> 
<PB N="122" REF="009961_0235_0F7B3E72CE5480B8">
utterly, and pay no more wor&s;hip to them, at any time. He requires a <HI>final</HI> parting with their idols. Not only that they &s;hould refrain from them for a while, but ca&s;t them away forever; and never gratify their idolatrous re&s;pect to them any more. This is &s;o exceeding con|trary to them, and what they are &s;o aver&s;e to and &s;o ob&s;tinate in their refu&s;al of, that they are enemies to God for it. They can't endure God's commands, be|cau&s;e they forbid all that which their hearts are &s;o en|gaged in. And as they hate God's commands, &s;o they hate Him who&s;e commands they are.</P>
<P N="3">3. HE threatens them with everla&s;ting damnation for their &s;ervice of their idols. He threatens them for their pa&s;t idolatry. He threatens them with his eternal wrath, for their having departed from him, and their having cho&s;en to them&s;elves other gods. He threa|tens them for that di&s;po&s;ition they have in their hearts to cleave to other gods: He threatens the <HI>le&s;t degrees</HI> of that re&s;pect which they have in their hearts to their idols. He manife&s;ts that he will not tolerate any re|gard to them, but has fixed eternal death, as the wages of every degree of it. And he won't relea&s;e them from their guilt; he holds them to their obligations; he won't acquit them at all: And he will accept of no atone|ment that they can make. He will not forgive them, whatever they do in religion; whatever pains they take; whatever tears they &s;hed. He will accept of no mo|ney or price that they have to offer.</P>
<P>And he threatens every future act of their idolatry. He not only forbids them ever to be guilty of the lea&s;t act, but forbids them on pain of eternal damnation. So &s;trictly does God prohibit them from the &s;ervice of their idols, that are &s;o dear to them, that are their all, and which they would on no account part with. He threatens them with everla&s;ting wrath for all exerci&s;es of inordinate love of worldly profit: for all manife&s;ta|tions of inordinate regard to worldly plea&s;ures, or world|ly
<PB N="123" REF="009961_0236_0F7B3E7386381250">
honors. He threatens them with everla&s;ting tor|ments for their &s;elf exaltation. He requires them to deny them&s;elves, and renounce them&s;elves, and to aba&s;e them&s;elves at his feet, on pain of bearing his wrath to all eternity.</P>
<P>The &s;trictne&s;s of God's law is a principle cau&s;e of man's enmity again&s;t God. If God were a God that did not &s;o much hate &s;in: if he were one who would allow them in the gratification of their lu&s;ts, in &s;ome degree; and his threatnings were not &s;o awful again&s;t all indulgence of their lu&s;t: if his threatnings were not &s;o ab&s;olute; if his di&s;plea&s;ure could be appea&s;ed by a few tears, and little reformation, or the like; they would not be &s;o great enemies, nor hate him &s;o much as they do now. But God &s;hews him&s;elf to be an im|placable enemy to their idols, to every degree of their &s;ervice of them; and has threaten'd everla&s;ting wrath, infinite calamity for all that they do in the &s;ervice of their lu&s;ts; and holds them bound under his wrath therefor. And this makes them irreconcilable enemies to him.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, the Scribes and Phari&s;ees were &s;uch bitter enemies to Chri&s;t; becau&s;e he &s;hewed him&s;elf to be &s;uch an enemy to their pride, and conceit of their own wi&s;dom, and their &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, and inordinate affectation of their own honor, which was their God. Natural men are enemies to God, becau&s;e he is &s;o op|po&s;ite to them, in that in which they place their all. If you go to take away that which is very dear to a man, nothing will provoke him more. God is infinitely op|po&s;ite to that in which natural men place all their de|light, and all their happine&s;s, viz. their gods. He is an enemy to that which natural men value as their greate&s;t honor and highe&s;t dignity; and which they tru&s;t wholly to, that which is all their dependence, viz. their own righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="009961_0237_0F7B3E7445DCCB20">Hence natural men are greater enemies to God, than they are to any other being. Some of their fellow-creatures may &s;tand very much in their way, with regard to &s;ome things they &s;et their hearts upon; but God op|po&s;es them with re&s;pect to all their idols, and tho&s;e gods which are their all. And then God's oppo&s;ition to their idols, which are above all things dear to them, is infi|nitely great. None of our fellow-creatures ever oppo|&s;es us in any of our intere&s;ts &s;o much as God oppo&s;es wicked men in their idolatry: For God has an infinite oppo&s;ition again&s;t it. His infinite oppo&s;ition is mani|fe&s;ted by his threatning an infinite puni&s;hment, viz. his dreadful wrath to all eternity, mi&s;ery without end. Hence we need not wonder that natural men are ene|mies to God.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, why natural men are God's enemies; I proceed to the la&s;t thing propos'd.</P>
<P N="4">IV. TO con&s;ider and make an&s;wer to &s;ome objecti|ons, that &s;ome may be ready to make again&s;t this.</P>
<P>Natural men don't generally conceive them&s;elves to be &s;o bad: they han't this notion of them&s;elves, that they are enemies to God. And therefore when they hear &s;uch doctrine as this taught them, they &s;tand rea|dy to make objections.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> I. SOME natural men may be ready to &s;ay, "I don't know that I feel any &s;uch enmity in my heart again&s;t God, as is &s;poken of. I am not &s;en&s;ible that I am &s;uch a dreadful enemy, &s;o as to hate God, and to have a mortal enmity again&s;t him: and to have a di&s;|po&s;ition, if I could, to kill him. I feel no &s;uch thing in my&s;elf, and why &s;hould I think that I have &s;uch a thing in me? If I have &s;uch enmity, why don't I feel it? If I am a mortal enemy, why &s;hould not I know it better than any body el&s;e? How can others

&s;ee what is in my heart, better than I my&s;elf? If I hate one of my fellow creatures, and have a &s;pirit again&s;t him, I can feel it inwardly working." To &s;uch an objection I would</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I. If you do but ob&s;erve your&s;elf, and &s;earch your own heart, unle&s;s you are &s;trangely blinded, you may be &s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e things, wherein enmity does fundamentally con&s;i&s;t. As particularly, you may be &s;en&s;ible that you have at lea&s;t had a low &amp; contemptible e&s;teem of God; and that you in your e&s;teem &s;et the trifles and vanities of this world, far above him; &s;o as to e&s;teem the enjoyment of the&s;e things far before the enjoyment of God, and to value the&s;e things better than his love. And you may be &s;en&s;ible that you de&s;pi&s;e the authority of God, and value his commands and his honor but very little. Or if by &s;ome means you have blinded your&s;elf now, &s;o as to think you do regard them now, doubtle&s;s you can look back and &s;ee that you have not regarded them. You may be &s;en&s;ible that you have had a di&s;reli&s;h and aver&s;ion towards God; an op|po&s;it on to thinking of God, or to have any thing to do with him; &s;o that it would have been a very uncom|fortable ta&s;k to have been confined to it for any time; and that when the vanities of the world, at the &s;ame time, have been very plea&s;ing to you; and you have been all &s;wallowed up in them, while you have been aver&s;e to the things of religion.</P>
<P>If you look into your heart, it is there plain to be &s;een, that there is an enmity in your will, that your will is contrary to God's will; for you have been oppo&s;ing the will of God all your life long. The&s;e things are plain in natural men; 'tis nothing but &s;ome great delu|&s;ion that can hide them from you. And the&s;e things are the foundation of all enmity: if the&s;e things be in you, all the re&s;t that we have &s;poken of will follow of cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="126" REF="009961_0239_0F7B3E75CC9A93E8">2. ONE rea&s;on why you han't more &s;en&s;ibly felt the exerci&s;es of malice again&s;t God, is that your enmity is now exerci&s;ed partly in your unbelief of God's being; and this prevents its appearing in other ways, that other|wi&s;e it would. Man has naturally a principle of athei&s;m in him; an indi&s;po&s;ition to realize God's being, and a di&s;po&s;ition to doubt of it. The being of God don't or|dinarily &s;eem real to natural men. All the di&s;coveries that there are of God's being, in his works, won't o|vercome the principle of athei&s;m, that is in the heart. And tho' they &s;eem in &s;ome mea&s;ure to be rationally convinced, yet it don't appear real; the conviction is faint, there is no &s;trong conviction impre&s;&s;ed on the mind, that there is a God: and often times they are ready to think that there is none. Now this will prevent the exerci&s;e of this enmity, that otherwi&s;e would be felt; particularly, it may be an occa&s;ion of there not being tho&s;e <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> exerci&s;es of hatred, that otherwi&s;e there would be.</P>
<P>It may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be illu&s;trated by this: If you had a rooted malice again&s;t another man, a princi|ple that had been long e&s;tabli&s;hed there; if you &s;hould hear that he was dead, and &s;o &s;hould conceive that he had no being, the &s;en&s;ible workings of your malice would not be felt, as when you realized it that he was alive, or that there was &s;uch a per&s;on: and that altho' there be the &s;ame thing in the foundation, which would appear, if you &s;hould afterwards hear the news contra|dicted, and perceive that your enemy was &s;till alive; you would feel the &s;ame workings of hatred that you did be|fore. And when you thought he was dead, you might feel the exerci&s;e of your enmity, in being glad of it. And thus your not realizing it, that God has a being, may prevent tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible workings of hatred, that other|wi&s;e you would have. If wicked men in this world were &s;en&s;ible of the reality of God's being, as the wick|ed are in another, they would feel more of that hatred,
<PB N="127" REF="009961_0240_0F7B3E77152F9198">
that men in another world do. The exerci&s;e of corrup|tion in one way, may, and often does prevent its work|ing in other ways. As covetou&s;ne&s;s may prevent the exerci&s;e of pride, &s;o athei&s;m may prevent malice; and yet it may be no argument of there being any the le&s;s of a principle of enmity in the heart; for 'tis the &s;ame enmity, working in another way. The &s;ame enmity that in this world works by athei&s;m, will in another world, where there will be no room for athei&s;m, work by malice and bla&s;phemy. The &s;ame mortal enmity that, if you &s;aw there was a God, might make you to wi&s;h him dead, and to de&s;ire, if it were po&s;&s;ible, to kill him, may now di&s;po&s;e and incline to think there is none. Men are very often apt to think things are &s;o as they would have them to be. The &s;ame principle di&s;po&s;es you to think God has no life, which, if you knew he had, would di&s;po&s;e you, if it were po&s;&s;ible to take it away.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF you think that there is a God, yet you don't realize it, that he is &s;uch a God as he is. You don't realize it, that he is &s;o holy a God as he is: You don't realize it, that he has &s;uch an hatred of &s;in as indeed he has. You don't realize it, that he is &s;o ju&s;t a God as he is, that will by no means clear the guilty. But that in the P&s;alms is applicable to you: "The&s;e things ha&s;t thou done, and I kept &s;ilence: thou thoughte&s;t that I was altogether &s;uch a one as thy &s;elf. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. l. 21.</NOTE> So that if you think there is a God, you don't think there is &s;uch a God as there is. And your athei&s;m appears in this, as well as in thinking there is no God. For that God that you think there is, is not that God that indeed is; but another, one of your own feigning, the fruit of your own vain, deluded imagination. So that your objection ari|&s;es from this, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> you don't find &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible hatred again&s;t that God which you have formed, to &s;uit your &s;elf; a God that you like better than the true God.
<PB N="128" REF="009961_0241_0F7B3E7742157668">
But this is no argument that you han't bitter enmity again&s;t the true God; for it was your enmity again&s;t the true God, and your not liking him, that has put you upon forming up another in your imagination, that you like better. It is your enmity again&s;t tho&s;e attributes of God's holine&s;s and ju&s;tice, and the like, that has put you upon conceiting another, who is not &s;o holy as he is, and don't hate &s;in &s;o much, and won't be &s;o &s;trictly ju&s;t in puni&s;hing it; and who&s;e wrath again&s;t &s;in is not &s;o terrible.</P>
<P>But if you was &s;en&s;ible of the vanity of your own conceits, and that God was not &s;uch an one as you have imagined; but that he is, as he is indeed, an infinitely holy, ju&s;t, &s;in hating &amp; &s;in revenging God, who will not tolerate nor endure the wor&s;hip of idols, you would be much more liable to feel the &s;en&s;ible exerci&s;es of enmity again&s;t him, than you are now. And this experience confirms. For we &s;ee that when men come to be under convictions, and to be made &s;en&s;ible that God is not as they have heretofore imagined; but that he is &s;uch a jealous, &s;in hating God, and who&s;e wrath again&s;t &s;in is &s;o dreadful, they are much more apt to have &s;en&s;ible exerci&s;es of en|mity again&s;t God, than before.</P>
<P N="4">4. YOUR having always been taught that God is in|finitely above you, and out of your reach, has prevented your enmity's being exerci&s;ed in tho&s;e ways, that other|wi&s;e it would have been. You have always from your infancy been taught, that God is &s;o high, that you can't hurt him; that notion has grown up with you. And hence you be not &s;en&s;ible, that you have any di&s;|po&s;ition to hurt him; becau&s;e it has been conceiv|ed &s;o impo&s;&s;ible, that it has not come into your mind. And hence your enmity has not been exerci&s;ed in re|vengeful thoughts; becau&s;e revenge has never found any room here; it has never found any handle to take hold of; there has been no conception of any &s;uch thing, and hence it has lain &s;till. A &s;erpent won't

bite, or &s;pit poi&s;on at that which it &s;ees at a great di&s;tance; which if it &s;aw near, would do it immedi|ately. Opportunity &s;hews what men be often times, whether friends or enemies. Opportunity to do, puts men in mind of doing; wakens up &s;uch principles as lay dormant before. Opportunity &s;tirs up de&s;ire to do, where there was before a di&s;po&s;ition, that without op|portunity would have lain &s;till. If a man has had an old grudge again&s;t another, and has a fair opportunity to be revenged, this will revive his malice, and waken up a de&s;ire of revenge.</P>
<P>If a great and &s;overeign prince injures a poor man, and tho' what he does is looked upon very cruel, that won't ordinarily &s;tir up that pa&s;&s;ionate revenge, as if he &s;u&s;tain'd no bigger an injury from one of his equals, becau&s;e he is &s;o much above him, and out of his reach. Many a man that has appeared calm and meek when he has had no power in his hands, and has not appeared, either to him&s;elf or others, to have any di&s;po&s;ition to the&s;e and tho&s;e cruel acts; that yet afterwards when he came to have opportunity by unexpected advancement, or otherwi&s;e, has appeared like a ravenous wolf, or de|vouring lion. So it was with <HI>Hazael.</HI> "And Hazael &s;aid, Why weepeth my lord? And he an&s;wered, Be|cau&s;e I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of I&s;rael: their &s;trong holds wilt thou &s;et on fire, and their young men wilt thou &s;lay with the &s;word, and wilt da&s;h their children, and rip up their women with child. And Hazael &s;aid, But what, is thy &s;ervant a dog, that he &s;hould do this great thing! And Eli&s;ha an&s;wered, The Lord hath &s;hewed me that thou &s;halt be king over Syria."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Kings viii. 12, 13.</NOTE> Hazael was then a &s;ervant; he had no power in his hands to do as he plea&s;ed; and &s;o that cruel di&s;|po&s;ition that was in him had lain hid, and he did not him&s;elf imagine that it was there: Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> afterwards, when he became king of Syria, and was ab&s;olute, and
<PB N="130" REF="009961_0243_0F7B3E78B7EB1BF8">
had none to controul him; then it broke out and ap|peared, and he did as the prophet had foretold. He committed tho&s;e very acts of cruelty, that he thought it was not in his heart to do. And it was want of op|portunity that was the thing that made the difference. It was all in his heart before: he was &s;uch a dog then as to do this thing, but only had not had opportunity. And therefore when he &s;eems &s;urprized that the prophet &s;hould &s;ay &s;o of him, all the rea&s;on the prophet gives is, "The Lord hath &s;hewed me that thou &s;halt be king over Syria."</P>
<P>And &s;ome natural men are &s;uch dogs as to do things, if they had opportunity, which they don't imagine it is in their hearts to do. You object again&s;t your having a <HI>mortal</HI> hatred again&s;t God; that you never felt any de&s;ire to kill him. But one rea&s;on has been, that it has always been conceived &s;o impo&s;&s;ible by you, and you have been &s;o &s;en&s;ible how much de&s;ires would be in vain, that it has kept down &s;uch a de&s;ire. But if the life of God were within your reach, and you knew it, it would not be &s;afe one hour. Who knows what thoughts would pre&s;ently ari&s;e in your heart by &s;uch an opportunity, and what di&s;po&s;ition would be rai&s;ed up in your heart! Who would tru&s;t your heart, that there would not pre&s;ently be &s;uch thoughts as the&s;e, tho' they are enough to make one tremble to mention them? "Now I have opportunity to &s;et my&s;elf at liberty &mdash; that I need not be'kept in continual &s;lavery by the &s;trict law of God.&mdash;Then I may take my liberty to walk in that way I like be&s;t, and need not be continually in &s;uch &s;lavi&s;h fear of God's di&s;plea&s;ure. And God has not done well by me, in many in&s;tances. He has done mo&s;t unju&s;tly by me, in holding me bound to de&s;truction for unbelief, and other things which I can't help&mdash; He has &s;hewn mercy to others, and refu&s;ed it to me. I have now an opportunity to deliver my &s;elf, and there can be no danger of my being hurt for it: God will not be

alive to revenge it. And then there will be no God for us to be terrified about, and &s;o keep us in &s;lavery."</P>
<P>Who would tru&s;t your heart, that &s;uch thoughts would not ari&s;e? And others, much more horrid? too dread|ful to be mention'd! and therefore I forbear. Tho&s;e natural men are fooli&s;hly in&s;en&s;ible of what is in their own hearts, who think there would be no danger of any &s;uch workings of heart, if they knew they had oppor|tunity.</P>
<P N="5">5. YOU little con&s;ider, how much your having no more of the &s;en&s;ible exerci&s;es of hatred to God, is ow|ing to a being re&s;trained by fear. You have always been taught what a dreadful thing it is to hate God. And you have been taught what a dreadful Being GOD is, and how terrrible God's di&s;plea&s;ure is; that God &s;ees the heart and knows all the thoughts; and that you are in his hands, and he can make you as mi&s;erable as he plea&s;es, and as &s;oon as he plea&s;es. And the&s;e things have re|&s;trained you: and the fear that has ri&s;en from the&s;e things, has kept you from appearing what you be; it has kept down your enmity, and made that &s;erpent afraid to &s;hew it's head, as otherwi&s;e it would do. If a man were wholly under the power of an enemy, tho' he were never &s;o much of an enemy to him, he would be afraid to exerci&s;e his hatred in outward acts, unle&s;s it was with great di&s;gui&s;e. And if it be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch an enemy, in who&s;e power he was, could &s;ee his heart, and know all his thoughts; and apprehended that he would put him to a terrible death, if he &s;aw the workings of malice there, how greatly would this re|&s;train! He would be afraid &s;o much as to believe him|&s;elf, that he hated his enemy: But there would be all manner of &s;mothering, di&s;gui&s;e and hypocri&s;y, and feign|ing even of thoughts and affections.</P>
<P>Thus your enmity has been kept under re&s;traint; and thus it has been from your infancy. You have grown
<PB N="132" REF="009961_0245_0F7B3E7BE0587CB0">
up in it, &s;o that it is become an habitual re&s;traint. You dare not &s;o much as think you hate God. If you do exerci&s;e hatred, you have a di&s;gui&s;e for it, whereby you endeavour even to hide it from your own con&s;cience; and &s;o have all along deceived your &s;elf. And your deceit is very old and habitual: And hence you are &s;o difficultly convinced. But this has been only re&s;traint: it has been no mortification. But there has been an enmity again&s;t God in its full &s;trength. It has been only re&s;trained, like an enemy that dur&s;t not ri&s;e up and &s;hew him&s;elf.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 6. One rea&s;on why you have not felt more &s;en&s;ible hatred to God may be becau&s;e you have not had much trial of what is in your heart. It may be God has hitherto in a great mea&s;ure let you alone. The enmity that is in men's hearts again&s;t God, is like a &s;erpent, which if it be let alone lies &s;till; but if any body di&s;turbs it, will &s;oon hi&s;s, and be enraged, and &s;hew its &s;erpentine &s;piteful nature.</P>

You only cover your enmity with a painted vail. You put on the di&s;gui&s;e of a friend, but in your heart you are a mortal enemy for all that. There is external honor, but inward contempt: There is a &s;hew of friend&s;hip and regard, but inward hatred. You do but deceive your&s;elf with your &s;hew of re&s;pect; and endeavour to deceive God: not con|&s;idering that God looks not on the outward appearance, but that he looks on the heart.</P>
<P>Here con&s;ider particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT much of that &s;eeming re&s;pect which natu|ral men &s;hew to God, is owing to their education. They have been taught from their infancy that they ought to &s;hew great re&s;pect to God. They have been taught to u&s;e re&s;pectful language, when &s;peaking about God, and to behave with &s;olemnity, when attending on tho&s;e exerci&s;es of religion, wherein they have to do with God. They from their childhood have &s;een that
<PB N="137" REF="009961_0250_0F7B3E81C56DC928">
this is the manner of others, when they pray to God, to u&s;e reverential expre&s;&s;ions, and a reverential behaviour before him. And their &s;hew of re&s;pect, which they make to God, is owing in a great mea&s;ure to this.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are brought up in places where they have commonly from their infancy, heard men take the name of God in vain, and &s;wear and cur&s;e, and bla&s;pheme; they learn to do the &s;ame; and it becomes habitual to them &s;o to do. And it is the &s;ame way, &amp; no other, that you have learned to behave re&s;pectfully towards God; not that you have any more re&s;pect to God than they: but they have been brought up one way, and you ano|ther. In &s;ome parts of the world, men are brought up in the wor&s;hip of idols of &s;ilver, and gold, and wood, and &s;tone, made in the &s;hape of men and bea&s;ts. "They &s;ay of them, Let the men that &s;acrifice, ki&s;s the calf."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> xiii. 2.</NOTE> In &s;ome parts of the world, they are brought up to wor|&s;hip &s;erpents, and are taught from their infancy to car|ry it with great re&s;pect to them. And in &s;ome places, they are brought up in wor&s;hiping the devil, who ap|pears to them in a bodily &s;hape; and to behave with a &s;hew of great reverence and honor towards him. And what re&s;pect you &s;hew to God has no better foundati|on; it comes the &s;ame way, and is worth no more.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT &s;hew of re&s;pect which you make is <HI>forced.</HI> You come to God, and make a great &s;hew of re&s;pect to him, and u&s;e very re&s;pectful terms, with a re&s;pectful, reverential tone and manner of &s;peaking; and your countenance is grave and &s;olemn; and you put on an humble a&s;pect; and you kneel, and u&s;e humble, re&s;|pectful po&s;tures, out of fear. You are afraid that God will execute his wrath upon you; and &s;o you feign a great deal of re&s;pect, that he may not be angry with you. "Through the greatne&s;s of thy power &s;hall thine ene|mies &s;ubmit them&s;elves unto thee."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxvi. 3.</NOTE> In the original it is, "&s;hall thine enemies lie to thee." It is render'd therefore
<PB N="138" REF="009961_0251_0F7B3E8281443800">
in the margin, "&s;hall yield feigned obedience to thee." Al that you do in religion is forc'd and feign'd. Thro' the greatne&s;s of God's power, you yield feigned obedi|ence. You are in God's power, and he is able to de|&s;troy you; and &s;o you feign a great deal of re&s;pect to him, that he might not de&s;troy you. As one might do towards an enemy that had taken him captive, though he at the &s;ame time would gladly make his e&s;cape, if he could, by taking away the life of him who had taken him captive.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is not real re&s;pect that moves you to behave &s;o towards God: you do it becau&s;e you hope you &s;hall get by it. 'Tis re&s;pect to your&s;elf, and not re&s;pect to God, that moves you. You hope to move God to be|&s;tow the rewards of his children, by it. You are like the Jews who followed Chri&s;t, and called him <HI>Rabbi,</HI> and would make him a king. Not that they honored him &s;o much in their hearts, as to think him worthy of the honor of a king; or that they had the re&s;pect of &s;incere &s;ubjects; but they did it for the &s;ake of the loaves. "Je&s;us perceived that they would come and make him a king. And when they had found him on the other &s;ide of the &s;ea, they &s;aid unto him, Rabbi, how came&s;t thou hither? Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid un|to them, Verily, verily I &s;ay unto you, Ye &s;eek me, not becau&s;e you &s;aw the miracles, but becau&s;e ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. vi 15 25, 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>The&s;e things don't argue but that you are implacable enemies to God notwith&s;tanding. If you examine your prayers and other duties, your own con&s;ciences will tell you, that the &s;eeming re&s;pect which you have &s;hewn to God in them, has been only in hypocri&s;y. That often|times you have &s;et forth in your prayers, that God was a great God, and a glorious God, and an infinitely holy God, as if you greatly honor'd him on the account of the&s;e attributes; and you, at the &s;ame time, had no

&s;en&s;e in your heart of the greatne&s;s and gloriou&s;ne&s;s of God, or of any excellency in his holine&s;s. And &s;o your own con&s;ciences will tell you, that you have often pretended to be thankful; you have told God, that you thank'd him that you was alive, and thank'd him for the&s;e and tho&s;e mercies, when you have not found the lea&s;t jot of thankfulne&s;s in your heart. And &s;o you have told God of your own unworthine&s;s, and &s;et forth what a vile creature you was; when you have had no humble &s;en&s;e of your own unworthine&s;s.</P>
<P>And if the&s;e forementioned re&s;traints were thrown off, you would &s;oon throw off all your &s;hew of re&s;pect. Take away fear, and take away a regard to your own intere&s;t, and there would &s;oon be an end to all tho&s;e ap|pearances of love, honor, and reverence, which now you make. All the&s;e things are not at all incon&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t implacable enmity.</P>
<P>The devil him&s;elf made a &s;hew of re&s;pect to Chri&s;t, when he was afraid that he was going to torment him; and when he hoped to per&s;wade Chri&s;t to &s;pare him lon|ger. "When he &s;aw Je&s;us, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice &s;aid, What have I to do with thee, Je&s;us, thou &s;on of God mo&s;t high? I be&s;eech thee, torment me not." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luk. viii. 28.</NOTE></P>

If you have wept before God, from the con|&s;ideration of your own pitiful ca&s;e; that has been be|cau&s;e you loved your &s;elf, and not becau&s;e you had any re&s;pect to God. And if your tears have been from &s;orrow for your &s;ins; you have mourned for your &s;ins, becau&s;e you have &s;inned again&s;t your &s;elf, and not be|cau&s;e you have &s;inned again&s;t God.

<P N="2">2. PRIDE, and a good thought of them&s;elves, very commonly has a great hand in the affections of natural men. They have a good opinion of what they are doing when they are praying; and the reflection on that affects them: they are affected with their own goodne&s;s. Men's &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s often occa&s;ions tears. An high opinion of them&s;elves before God, and an imagination of their being per&s;ons of great account with him, has affected them, in their tran&s;actions with God.</P>
<P>There is commonly abundance of pride in the mid&s;t of tears; and pride is in a great mea&s;ure the &s;cource of them. And then they are &s;o far from being an argu|ment that you be not an enemy to God, that on the contrary, they are an argument, that you be. In your very tears, you are, in a vain conceit of your&s;elf, ex|alting your &s;elf again&s;t God.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE affections of natural men do often ari&s;e from wrong conceits that they have of God. They con|ceive of God after the manner they do of men, as tho' he were a being liable to be wrought upon in his affecti|ons. They conceive of him as one who&s;e heart could be drawn, who&s;e affections can be overcome, by what he &s;ees in them. They conceive of him as being taken with them, and their performances; and this works on their affections; and thus one tear draws another, and
<PB N="141" REF="009961_0254_0F7B3E84C576E530">
their affections increa&s;e by reflection. And oftentimes they conceive of God as one that loves them, and is a friend to them: and &s;uch a mi&s;take may work much on their affections. But &s;uch affections that ari&s;e towards God, as they conceit him to be, is no argument that they have not the &s;ame implacable hatred towards God, con&s;idered as he really is. There is no concluding that men are not enemies, becau&s;e they are affected and &s;hed tears in their prayers, and the like. <HI>Saul</HI> was very much affected when <HI>David</HI> expo&s;tulated with him a|bout pur&s;uing after him, and &s;eeking to kill him. <HI>David</HI>'s words wrought exceedingly upon <HI>Saul</HI>'s af|fections. "And it came to pa&s;s when <HI>David</HI> had made an end of &s;peaking the&s;e words unto <HI>Saul,</HI> that <HI>Saul</HI> &s;aid, Is this thy voice, my &s;on <HI>David?</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI> lift up his voice and wept."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xxiv. 16, Chap. xxvi. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE> He was &s;o affected that he wept aloud, and called David <HI>his Son,</HI> tho' he was but ju&s;t before &s;eeking his life.

<P>INF. I. IF it be &s;o, that natural men are God's enemies; then hence we may learn, how much we are indebted to God for his re&s;training grace. If all na|tural men are God's enemies, what would they not do, if they were not re&s;train'd! For what has one that is an enemy, within him&s;elf, or in his di&s;po&s;ition, to re&s;train him from acting again&s;t him tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he is an enemy to? Hatred won't re&s;train a man from acting any thing
<PB N="142" REF="009961_0255_0F7B3E8579166140">
what&s;oever again&s;t him that is hated. Nothing is too bad for hatred, if it be meer hatred, and no love; no|thing is too bad for that to do towards the object of it. Hatred &s;hews no kindne&s;s either in doing, or forbearing. Only hatred will never make a man forbear to act any thing what&s;oever again&s;t God; for the very nature of hatred is to &s;eek evil. But wicked men, as has been &s;hewn, are meer enemies to God. They have hatred, without any love at all. And hence natural men have nothing within them, in their own nature, to re&s;train them from any thing that is bad, be it never &s;o bad: and therefore their re&s;traint mu&s;t not be owing to nature, but to re&s;training grace. And therefore whatever wick|edne&s;s we have been kept from, it is not becau&s;e we have not been bad enough to commit it; but it is God has re&s;trained us, and kept us back from &s;in. There can be no wor&s;e principle, than a principle of hatred to God. The devils in hell don't do any thing from any wor&s;e principle than this. And there can be no principle that will go further in wickedne&s;s than this, if it be neither mortified nor re&s;trained. But it is not mortified in natural men; and therefore all that keeps them from any degree of wickedne&s;s, is re&s;trained. If we have &s;een others do things that we never did; and if they have done wor&s;e than we, this is owing to re|&s;training grace. If we have not done as bad as <HI>Pha|raoh,</HI> it is owing to divine re&s;traints. If we have not done as bad as <HI>Judas,</HI> or as the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, or as bad as <HI>Herod,</HI> or <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> it is becau&s;e God has re&s;trained our corruption. If we have ever heard or read of any that have done wor&s;e than we; if we have not gone the length in &s;inning, that the mo&s;t wicked pirates or carnal per&s;ecutors have gone, this is owing to re&s;training grace. For we are all naturally the enemies of God as much as they. If we have not committed the unpardonable &s;in, it is owing to re|&s;training grace. There is no wor&s;e principle in exerci&s;e
<PB N="143" REF="009961_0256_0F7B3E87ABFE8320">
in that &s;in, than enmity again&s;t God. There is the entire fountain, and all the foundation of the &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, in that enmity again&s;t God, that we all have in us, and naturally reigns in us.</P>
<P>It is not we our &s;elves that re&s;train our &s;elves from the commi&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t imaginable wickedne&s;s; for enmity again&s;t God reigns in us and over us; we are under the power and dominion of it, and are &s;old under it. We do not re&s;train that which reigns over us. A &s;lave, as long as he continues a meer &s;lave, cannot controul his ma&s;ter. "He that committeth &s;in, is the &s;ervant of &s;in. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. viii. 34.</NOTE> So that the re&s;traint of this our cruel tyrant, is owing to God, and not to us. What does a poor, impotent &s;ubject do to re&s;train the ab&s;olute Lord, that has him wholly under his power?</P>
<P>How much will it appear that the world is indebted to the re&s;training grace of God, if we con&s;ider that the world is full of enemies to God. The world is full of inhabitants; and almo&s;t all are God's enemies, his im|placable and mortal enemies. What therefore would they not do; what work would they not make, if God did not re&s;train them?</P>
<P>GOD's work in the re&s;traint that he exerci&s;es over a wicked world, is a glorious work. God's holding the reins upon the corruptions of a wicked world, and &s;ett|ing bounds to their wickedne&s;s, is a more glorious work, than his ruling the raging of the &s;ea, and &s;etting bounds to its proud waves, and &s;aying, hitherto &s;halt thou come, and no further. In hell, God lets the wickedne&s;s of wicked &s;pirits have the reins, to rage without re&s;traint; and it would be in a great mea&s;ure upon earth as it in hell, did not God re&s;train the wickedne&s;s of the world.</P>
<P>But in order to the better under&s;tanding how it is owing to the re&s;training grace of God, that we are kept
<PB N="144" REF="009961_0257_0F7B3E88AFA910A8">
and with-held from the highe&s;t acts of &s;in, I would here ob&s;erve &s;everal things.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHENEVER men are with held from &s;inning by the common influence of God's &s;pirit, they are with|held by re&s;training grace. If &s;inners are awakened &s;in|ners, and are made &s;en&s;ible of the great guilt that &s;in brings, and that it expo&s;es to a dreadful puni&s;hment; they under &s;uch circum&s;tances dare not allow them&s;elves in wilful &s;in: God re&s;trains them <HI>by the convictions of his</HI> &s;pirit; and therein their being kept from &s;in, is owing to re&s;training grace. And &s;inners that live under the go&s;pel, that are not awakened &s;inners, but in a great mea&s;ure &s;ecure, yet commonly have &s;ome degrees of the influence of God's &s;pirit with his ordinances influ|encing natural con&s;cience. And tho' they be not &s;uffi|cient thoroughly to rou&s;e them out of &s;ecurity, or make them reform; yet they keep them from going &s;uch lengths in &s;in, as otherwi&s;e they might do. And when it is thus, this is re&s;training grace. They are very &s;tu|pid and &s;otti&s;h; yet they would be a great deal more &s;o, if God &s;hould let them wholly alone.</P>
<P N="2">2. ALL the re&s;traints that men are under from the word and ordinances, is from re&s;training grace. The word and ordinances of God might have &s;ome degree of influence on men's natural principles of &s;elf-love, to re&s;train them from &s;in, without any degree of the influence of God's &s;pirit: But this would be the re&s;training grace of God; for God's goodne&s;s and mercy to a &s;inful world, appears in his giving his word to be a re&s;traint on the wickedne&s;s of the world. When men are re|&s;trained by fear of tho&s;e puni&s;hments that the word of God threatens; or by the warnings of the word, or by the offers and promi&s;es of it; when the word of God works upon hope, or upon fear, or natural con&s;cience, to re&s;train men from &s;in, this is the re&s;training grace of God. When we are re&s;trained thus, 'tis owing to the mercy of God that we are re&s;trained. 'Tis an in&s;tance
<PB N="145" REF="009961_0258_0F7B3E89743572B0">
of God's mercy that he has revealed hell, to re&s;train men's wickedne&s;s; and that he has revealed a way of &s;alvation, and a po&s;&s;ibility of eternal life. This is a thing that has great influence on men, to re&s;train them from &s;in; and this is the re&s;training grace of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. WHEN men are re&s;trained from &s;in, by the light of nature, this al&s;o is re&s;training grace. If men are de&s;titute of the light of God's word, yet the light of natural con&s;cience teaches that &s;in brings guilt, and ex|po&s;es to puni&s;hment. The light of nature teaches that there is a God who governs the world, and will reward the good and puni&s;h the evil. When men are re&s;train'd by this, they are to attribute their re&s;traints to the re|&s;training grace of God; for it is God who is the author of the light of nature, as well as the light of revelation. He in mercy to mankind, makes known many things by natural light to work upon men's fear and &s;elf love, to re&s;train their corruptions.</P>
<P N="4">4. WHEN God re&s;trains men's corruptions by his providence, this is re&s;training grace. And that whether it be his general providence, or his providence in order|ing the &s;tate of mankind; or his particular providence, or providential di&s;po&s;als towards them in particular.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) GOD doth greatly re&s;train the corruption of the world, by ordering the &s;tate of mankind. He has &s;et mankind here in a mortal &s;tate, &amp; that is a great re&s;traint on their corruption. He hath &s;et mankind in a &s;tate of probation for eternity, &amp; that is a great re&s;traint to corrup|tion. God hath &s;o ordered the &s;tate of mankind, that ordi|narily many kinds of &s;in &amp; wickedne&s;s are di&s;graceful, and what tend to the hurt of a man's character and re|putation among&s;t his fellow men; and that is a great re&s;traint. He hath &s;o di&s;po&s;ed the world, that many kinds of wickedne&s;s are many ways very contrary to men's temporal intere&s;t; and that is a great re&s;traint. God has &s;o di&s;po&s;ed the &s;tate of mankind that they are led to prohibit many kinds of wickedne&s;s by human
<PB N="146" REF="009961_0259_0F7B3E8A06626640">
laws; and that is a great re&s;traint. God hath &s;et up a church i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he world, made up of tho&s;e who, if they are an&s;werable to their profe&s;&s;ion, have the fear and love of God in their hearts; and they by holding forth light and the word of God, and keeping up the ordinances of God in the world, and by warning others, are a great re&s;traint to the wickedne&s;s of the world.</P>
<P>But in all the&s;e things, the re&s;training grace of God appears. It is God's mercy to mankind, that he has &s;o ordered their &s;tate, that they &s;hould have &s;o many things, by fear and a regard to their own intere&s;t, to re&s;train their corruptions. It is God's mercy to the world, that the &s;tate of mankind here, does &s;o differ in that re&s;pect, from the &s;tate of the damned in hell; where men will have none of the&s;e things to re&s;train them: they won't be in &s;uch circum&s;tances that will &s;o influence their hope and fear, to re&s;train them from &s;in.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom of God, as well as the attributes of God's grace, greatly appears in thus di&s;po&s;ing things for the re&s;training of the wickedne&s;s of men.</P>
<P N="2">(2) GOD doth greatl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;train the corruptions of men by his particular providence, or providence towards particular per&s;ons; by placing men in &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces as to lay them under re&s;traints. And to this it is often owing that &s;ome natural men never go &s;uch lengths in &s;inning, or are never guilty of &s;uch atrocious wicked|ne&s;s as &s;ome others, that providence has placed them in different circum&s;tances. If it were not for this, many thou&s;ands of natural men, who now live &s;ober and orderly lives, would do as <HI>Pharoah</HI> did. The rea&s;on why they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o not, is, that providence has placed them in different circum&s;tances. If they were in the &s;ame circum&s;tances as <HI>Pharoah</HI> was in, they would do as he did And &s;o, if in the &s;ame circum&s;tances as <HI>Mana&s;&s;ah</HI>&mdash;as <HI>Judas</HI>&mdash;as <HI>Nero</HI>&mdash; But provi|dence re&s;trains their corruptions, by putting them in &s;uch circum&s;tances, as not to open &s;uch a door or outlet for
<PB N="147" REF="009961_0260_0F7B3E8AC89A7BF0">
their corruption, as he did to them. So &s;ome do not do &s;uch horrid things as others, they do not live &s;uch horribly vicious lives as &s;ome others, becau&s;e providence has re&s;trained them by ordering that they &s;hould have a better education than others. Providence has order'd that they &s;hould be the children of pious parents, it may be, or &s;hould live where they &s;hould enjoy many means of grace; and &s;o providence has laid them under re&s;traints. Now this is re&s;training grace. The attribute of God's grace is exerci&s;ed in thus re&s;training per&s;ons in providence.</P>
<P>And oftentimes God re&s;trains men's corruptions by particular events of providence. By particular afflicti|ons they are brought under, or by particular occurren|ces, whereby God does, as it were, block up men's way in their cour&s;e of &s;in, or in &s;ome wickedne&s;s that they had devi&s;ed, and that otherwi&s;e they would perpetrate. Or &s;omething happens unexpected to hold men back from that which they were about to commit. When men are re&s;trained thus, it is God that re&s;trains them. Thus God re&s;trained <HI>David</HI> by his providence from &s;heding blood, as he intended to do. "Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy &s;oul liveth, &s;eeing the LORD hath <HI>witholden thee</HI> from coming to &s;hed blood, and from avenging thy &s;elf with thine own hand&mdash;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam xxv. 26.</NOTE> God witheld him from it no otherwi&s;e, than by ordering it &s;o in his providence that <HI>Abigail</HI> &s;hould come, and by her wi&s;dom &s;hould cool and pacify him, and per&s;wade him to alter his purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See ver. 32, 33, 34.</NOTE>.</P>

Peter</HI>&mdash; And when other godly per&s;ons are kept from falling into &s;uch &s;ins, or much wor&s;e &s;ins than the&s;e, it is owing to the re&s;training grace of God. Meerly having a principle of grace in their hearts, or meerly their being godly per&s;ons, without God's pre&s;ence to re&s;train them, will not keep them from great acts of &s;in. That the godly do not fall into the mo&s;t horrid &s;ins that can be conceived of, is owing not &s;o much to any incon|&s;i&s;tence between their falling into &s;uch &s;ins, and the hav|ing a principle of grace in the heart, as it is owing to the covenant mercy of God, whereby he has promi&s;ed never to leave nor for&s;ake his people; and that he will not &s;uffer them to be tempted above what they are able; but with the temptation will make a way for them to e&s;cape. If &s;aving grace re&s;trains men from great acts of &s;in, this is owing to God who gives &s;uch exerci&s;es of grace at that time when the temptation comes, that they are re&s;trained.</P>
<P>Let not the godly therefore be in&s;en&s;ible of their indebtedne&s;s to the re&s;training grace of God Tho' the godly cannot be &s;aid to be enemies to God, becau&s;e a principle of enmity does not reign; yet they have the very &s;ame principle and &s;eed of enmity in them, tho' it be mortified. Tho' it be not in reigning power, yet it has great &s;trength; and is too &s;trong for them, with|out God's almighty power to help them again&s;t it. Tho' they be not enemies to God, becau&s;e they have another principle, be&s;ides a principle of enmity, viz. a principle of love; yet their old man, the body of &s;in and death that yet remains in them, is a mortal enemy to God. Corruption in the godly, is not a whit better than it is in the wicked. The corruption in them is of as bad a nature every whit, as that which is in a mortal enemy to God: it aims at the life of God, where ever it is. And tho' it be not in reigning power; yet it would dreadfully rage, were it not for God's re&s;training grace.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="009961_0262_0F7B3E8C47FFC290">GOD gives his re&s;training grace to both natural men and godly men; but only there is this difference. God gives his re&s;training grace to his children in way of co|venant mercy: 'tis part of the mercy promi&s;ed to them in his covenant. God is faithful, and will not leave them to &s;in in like manner as wicked men do; other|wi&s;e they would do every whit as bad.</P>
<P>Let not therefore the godly attribute it to them&s;elves, or meerly to their own goodne&s;s, that they be not guilty of &s;uch horrid crimes as they hear of in others: let them con&s;ider 'tis not owing to them, but to God's re|&s;traints.</P>

<P>INF. II. HENCE we may learn the rea&s;on why na|tural men will not come to Chri&s;t: For they do not come becau&s;e they <HI>will not</HI> come. "Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. v. 40.</NOTE> When we &s;ay that natural men be not willing to come to Chri&s;t, it is not meant that they are not willing to be delivered from hell; for without do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bt, no natural man is willing to go to hell. 'Nor is it meant, that they are not willing that Chri&s;t &s;hould keep them from going to hell. With|out doubt, natural men that are under awakenings, do often greatly de&s;ire this. But if they do de&s;ire it, this don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t argue that they are willing to come to Chri&s;t&punc; for
<PB N="151" REF="009961_0264_0F7B3E8E054D8F28">
notwith&s;tanding their de&s;ire to be delivered from hell, yet their heart don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t clo&s;e with Chri&s;t, but are aver&s;e to him. They &s;ee nothing in Chri&s;t wherefore they &s;hould de&s;ire him; no beauty or comeline&s;s to draw or incline their hearts to him. And they are not willing to take Chri&s;t as he is; they would feign divide Chri&s;t. There are &s;ome things in him that they like, and others that they greatly di&s;like; but con&s;ider him as he is, and as he is offered to them in the go&s;pel, and they will not have him. They are not willing to accept of Chri&s;t as he is offered; for in doing &s;o, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity part with all their &s;ins; they mu&s;t &s;ell the world, and part with their own righteou&s;ne&s;s But they are not willing to do that; they had rather, for the pre&s;ent, run the venture of going to hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> than do that.</P>
<P>When men are truly willing to come to Chri&s;t, they are <HI>freely</HI> willing. It is not what they are <HI>forced</HI> and drove to by threatnings; but they are willing to come, and choo&s;e to come without being driven. But natu|ral men have no &s;uch free willingne&s;s; but on the con|trary have an aver&s;ion. And the ground of it is that which we have heard, viz. That they are enemies to God. Their having &s;uch a reigning enmity again&s;t God, makes them ob&s;tinately refu&s;e to come to Chri&s;t. If a man is an enemy to God, he will nece&s;&s;arily be an ene|my to Chri&s;t too; for Chri&s;t is the Son of God; he is infinitely near to God, yea he is God. He has the nature of God, as well as the nature of man. He is a &s;aviour appointed of God. God anointed him, and &s;ent him into the world. And in doing what he did in the work of redemption, he wrought the works of God He al|ways did tho&s;e things that plea&s;ed God; and all that he does as a &s;aviour, is to the glory of God. And one great thing that he aimed at in his redemption, was to deliver them from their idols which they had cho&s;en, and bring them to God. The c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e being &s;o, and &s;inners being enemies to God, they will nece&s;&s;arily be oppo&s;ite to

coming to Chri&s;t; for Chri&s;t is of God, and as a &s;avi|our &s;eeks to bring them to God only: But natural men are not of God, but are aver&s;e to him.</P>
<P>INF. III. FROM this doctrine we may learn, how dreadful the condition of natural men is. Their &s;tate is a &s;tate of enmity with God. If we con&s;ider what God is, and what men are, it will be ea&s;y for us to conclude that &s;uch men as are God's enemies, mu&s;t be mi&s;erable. Con&s;ider, ye that are enemies to God, how great a God he is that you are enemies to. He is the eternal God; the God that fills heaven and earth, and whom the hea|ven of heavens cannot contain. He is the God that made you; the God in who&s;e hand your breath is, and who&s;e are all your ways; the God in whom you live and move, and have your being; the God who has your &s;oul and body in his hands every moment.</P>
<P>You would look on your&s;elf as in very unhappy cir|cum&s;tances, if your neighbours were all your enemies, and none of your fellow creatures were your friends. If every body was &s;et again&s;t you, and all de&s;pi&s;ed and hated you, you would be ready to think, you had bet|ter be out of the world than in it. But if it be &s;uch a calamity to have enmity maintained between you and your fellow creatures, what is it, when you and the al|mighty God are enemies one to another? What avails either the friend&s;hip or enmity of you neighbours, poor little worms of the du&s;t, that are about you, in compa|ri&s;on of the friend&s;hip or enmity of the great God of heaven and earth? Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. IF you continue in your enmity a little longer, there will be a mutual enmity between God and you to all eternity. God will appear to be your dreadful &amp; irre|concilable enemy. And you know not how &s;oon it will come to this. If you &s;hould die an enemy to God, there will be no &s;uch thing as any reconciliation after death. God will then appear in hatred of you. As
<PB N="153" REF="009961_0266_0F7B3E8F39B7CD78">
you are a meer enemy to God, &s;o God will then ap|pear a meer enemy to you; he will appear in perfect hatred, without any love, and without any pity, and without any mercy at all. As you hate God, he will hate you. And that will be verified of you: "My &s;oul loath|ed them, and their &s;oul abhored me."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Zech. xi. 8.</NOTE> And then God will be your enemy forever. If you be not reconciled &s;o as to become his friend in this life, God never will become your friend after death. If you continue an enemy to God 'till death, God will continue an enemy to you to all eternity. There will nothing avail to re|concile God to you hereafter. You will find that you can't move the heart of God by any of your cries. You will have no mediator offered you; there will be no days man betwixt you. So that it becomes you to con&s;ider what it will be to have God your enemy to all eternity, without any po&s;&s;ibility of being reconciled.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, what will it be to have this enmity to be mutual, or maintain'd for ever on both &s;ides? For as God will for ever continue an enemy to you, &s;o you will for ever continue an enemy to God. If you con|tinue God's enemy until death, you will always be his enemy. And after death your enmity will have no re|&s;traint, but it will break out and rage without controul. When you come to be a fire-brand of hell, you will be a fire-brand in two re&s;pects, viz. As you will be all on fire full of the fire of God's wrath: and al&s;o as you will be all on a blaze with &s;pite &amp; malice toward God. You will be as full of the fire of malice, as you will with the fire of divine vengeance, &amp; both will make you full of tor|ment. Then you will appear as you be, a viper indeed. You are now a viper; but under great di&s;gui&s;e; a wolf in &s;heep's cloathing: But then your ma&s;k will be pulled off; you &s;hall loo&s;e your garments, and walk naked.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvi. 15.</NOTE> Then will you as a &s;erpent &s;pit poi&s;on at God, and vent your rage and malice in fearful bla&s;phemies. Out of

that mouth, out of which, when you open it, will pro|ceed flames, will al&s;o proceed dreadful bla&s;phemies again&s;t God. That &s;ame tongue, to cool which you will wi&s;h for a drop of water, will be eternally employed in cur&s;ing and bla&s;pheming God and Chri&s;t. And that not from any new corruption being put into your heart; but only from God's withdrawing his hand from re|&s;training your old corruption. And what a mi&s;erable way will this be of &s;pending your eternity!</P>
<P N="2">(2) Con&s;ider, What will be the con&s;equence of a mutual enmity between God and you, if it be continued. Now you find your &s;elf left alone; you find no very terrible event: but there will be great changes. Tho' hitherto you have met with no very great changes, yet they will come. After a little while, dying time will come; and then what will be the con&s;equence of this enmity? God, who&s;e enemy you be; has the frame of your body in his hands. Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur times are in his hand; and he it is that appoints your bounds. And when he &s;ends death to arre&s;t you, and change your countenance, and di&s;&s;olve your frame, and take you away from all your earthly friends, and from all that is dear and plea|&s;ant to you in the world; what will be the i&s;&s;ue then of God and you being enemies one to another? Will not you then &s;tand in need of God's help? Would not he be the be&s;t friend in &s;uch a ca&s;e, worth more than ten thou&s;and earthly friends? If God be your enemy, then who will you betake your &s;elf to for a friend? When you launch forth into the boundle&s;s gulf of eternity, then you will need &s;ome friend to take care of you, but if God be your enemy, where will you betake your &s;elf? Your &s;oul mu&s;t go naked into another world, in eternal &s;epe|ration f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om all worldly things: and you won't be able to di&s;po&s;e of your &s;elf; your &s;oul will not be in its own power to defend, or di&s;po&s;e of it &s;elf. Will you not then need to have God for a friend, into who&s;e

hands you may commend your &s;pirit? And how dread|ful will it be, to have God your enemy then!</P>
<P>The time is coming when the frame of this world &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved Chri&s;t &s;hall de&s;cend in the clouds of heaven, in the glory of his Father; and you, with all the re&s;t of mankind, mu&s;t &s;tand before the judgment &s;eat of God. Then what will be the con&s;equence of this mutual enmity betw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en God and you! If God be your enemy, who will &s;tand your friend? Who el&s;e will be able to help you, &amp; what will you do? And what will be the event of God's being your enemy then? Now, it may be, it does not appear to be very terrible to you to have God for your enemy; but when &s;uch changes as the&s;e are brought to pa&s;s, it will greatly alter the appearance of things. Then God's favour will ap|pear to you of infinite worth. They, and they only will then appear happy, who have the love of God: and then you will know that God's enemies are mi&s;e|rable.</P>
<P>But under this head, con&s;ider more particularly &s;everal things,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) WHAT God can do to his enemies. Or rather, what can he not do? How mi&s;erable can he who is al|mighty make his enemies, &amp; tho&s;e that he is an enemy to? Con&s;ider, you that are enemies to God, whether or no you &s;hall be able to make your part good with him. "Do we provoke the Lord to jealou&s;y?

Do you think you &s;hall be well able to de|fend your&s;elf? Or will you be able to e&s;cape out of his hand? Or do you think to harden your own heart, and fortify your&s;elf with courage, and &s;et your&s;elf to bear? And do you think that you &s;hall be able to

uphold your &s;pirits, when God acts as an enemy towards you? If &s;o, then gird up your loins, and prepare to meet God, and &s;ee what the event will be. Therefore thus will I do unto thee,&mdash;and becau&s;e I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God.&mdash;" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amos, iv. 12.</NOTE> Is it not in vain to &s;et the briars and thorns in battle again&s;t God?

<P>And if you endeavour to &s;upport your&s;elf under God's wrath, can't God lay &s;o much upon you as to &s;ink and cru&s;h you? Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t he lay you under &s;uch mi&s;ery, as to cau&s;e your &s;pirit quite to fail; &s;o that you &s;hall find no &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t him, or to uphold your&s;elf? Why &s;hould a little worm think of &s;upporting him&s;elf again&s;t an omnipotent adver&s;ary? Has not he that made you, and gave you your &s;trength and your cou|rage, got your &s;trength and courage in his hands? Is it an hard thing for him to overcome it? Con&s;ider God has made your &s;oul; and he that made it. knows how to puni&s;h it, to what degree he will. He can fill it with mi&s;ery; he can bring what degree of &s;orrow, and angui&s;h, and horror he will. And he that made your body, can bring what torments he will upon it. He has made every vein and &s;inew: and has every one in his hands, and he can fill every one as full of tor|ments as he will. God who made you, has given you a capacity to bear torment; and he has that capacity in his hands; and he can enlarge it, and make you capa|ble of more mi&s;ery, as much more as he will. If God hates any one, and &s;ets him&s;elf again&s;t him as his ene|my, what cannot he do with him? How dreadful mu&s;t it be to fall into the hands of &s;uch an enemy! Surely,

"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God." <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heb. x 31.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. IF God be your meer enemy, you may rationally conclude that he will act as &s;uch in his dealings with you. We have already ob&s;erved that you are a mere enemy to God; that is, have enmity without any love or true re&s;pect. So, if you continue to be &s;o, God will appear to be your meer enemy; and will be &s;o forever, with|out being reconciled. But if it be &s;o, he will doubtle&s;s act as &s;uch. If he eternally hates you, he will act in his dealings with you, as one that hates you with meer hatred, without any love or pity. The proper tenden|cy and aim of hatred is the mi&s;ery of the object hated; mi&s;ery, and nothing el&s;e. So that you may expect God will make you mi&s;erable, and that you will not be &s;pa|red; for &s;paring is not the effect of hatred, but of pity and mercy; which is a quite different thing from en|mity.</P>
<P>NOW God does not act as your meer enemy: If he corrects you, it is in mea&s;ure. He now exerci&s;es abun|dance of mercy to you. He threatens you now; but it is in a way of warning, and &s;o in a merciful way. He now calls and invites, and &s;trives with you, and waits to be gracious to you. But hereafter there will be an end to all the&s;e things: In another world God will cea&s;e to &s;hew you mercy.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF you will continue God's enemy, you may ra|tionally conclude that God will deal with you &s;o as to make it appear how dreadful it is to have God for an enemy. It is very dreadful to have a mighty prince for an enemy. "The wrath of a king, is as the roar|ing of a lion." <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xix. 12.</NOTE> But if the wrath of man, a fellow-worm, be &s;o terrible, what is the wrath of God! And God will doubtle&s;s &s;hew it to be immen&s;ely more dread|ful. If you will be an enemy, God will make you know that it is not a light thing to be an enemy to

That is, he will act &s;o as to glorify tho&s;e attributes which he exerci&s;es as an enemy; which are his maje&s;ty, his power and ju&s;tice. God will deal &s;o with you as to glorify the&s;e attributes in your de&s;truction. His great maje&s;ty, his awful ju&s;tice, and mighty power, &s;hall be &s;hewed up|on you.

<P>Con&s;ider, that all the&s;e things will be executed on you, if you continue God's enemies.</P>
<P>INF. IV. If it be &s;o, that natural men are God's enemies, hence we may learn how ju&s;tly God may re|fu&s;e to &s;hew you mercy. For is God obliged to &s;hew mercy to his enemies? Is God bound to &s;et his love on them that have no love to him; but hate him with perfect hatred? Is God bound to come and dwell with them that have an aver&s;ion to him, and choo&s;e to keep at a di&s;tance from him, and fly from him as one that is
<PB N="160" REF="009961_0273_0F7B3E95F8889C48">
hateful to them? If you earne&s;tly de&s;ire the &s;alvation of your &s;oul, is God bound to comply with your de&s;ires, when you do always re&s;i&s;t and oppo&s;e his will? Is God bound to be per&s;waded and overcome by your prayers, when you are ob&s;tinate in your oppo&s;ition to him, and refu&s;e to yield obedience to him? Is God bound to put honor upon you, and to advance you to &s;uch dignity as to be a child of the King of Kings, and the heir of the kingdom of glory, while you at the &s;ame time have God in the greate&s;t contempt, &amp; &s;et him too low to have the lowe&s;t place in your heart? Is God bound to &s;pare your life, and deliver you from eternal death, when you are a mortal enemy to God, and would, if you could, de&s;troy the Being of God? Is God oblig'd to &s;et his great and tran&s;cendant love on you, &s;o as to give you benefits purcha&s;ed by the blood of his own Son, when your heart is all the while full of that enmity that &s;trikes at the life of God?</P>
<P>This doctrine affords a &s;trong argument for the <HI>ab&s;o|lute &s;overeignty</HI> of God, with re&s;pect to the &s;alvation of &s;inners. If God is plea&s;ed to &s;hew mercy to his haters, it is certainly fit that he &s;hould do it in a &s;ove|reign way, without acting as any way obliged. God will &s;hew mercy to his mortal enemies; but then he will not be bound, he will have his liberty to choo&s;e the objects of his mercy; to &s;hew mercy to what enemy he plea&s;es, and puni&s;h and de&s;troy which of his haters he plea&s;es. And certainly this is a fit and rea&s;onable thing. It is fit that God &s;hould di&s;tribute &s;aving ble&s;|&s;ings in this way, and in no other, viz. in a &s;overeign and arbitrary way. And that ever any body thought of or devi&s;ed any other way for God to &s;hew mercy, than to have mercy on whom he would have mercy, mu&s;t ari&s;e from ignorance of their own hearts, whereby they were in&s;en&s;ible what enemies they naturally are to God.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="009961_0274_0F7B3E96B7B48750">But con&s;ider here the following things,</P>
<P N="1">1. How cau&s;ele&s;ly you are enemies to God. You have no manner of rea&s;on for it, either from what God is, or from what he has done. You have no rea&s;on for this from what he is. For he is an infinitely lovely and glorious Being; the fountain of all excellency: All that is amiable and lovely in the univer&s;e, is origi|nally and eminently in him. Nothing can po&s;&s;ibly be conceived of that could be lovely in God, that is not in him, &amp; that in the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree, even infinitely.</P>
<P>And you have no rea&s;on for this, from what God has done. For he has been a good &amp; bountiful God to you. He has exerci&s;ed abundance of kindne&s;s to you; has carried you from the womb, pre&s;erved your life, taken care of you, and provided for you, all your life long. He has exerci&s;ed great patience and long &s;uffering to|wards you. If it had not been for the kindne&s;s of God to you, what would have become of you? What would have become of your body? And what, before this time would have become of your &s;oul? And you are now, every day, and hour, maintained by the good|ne&s;s and bounty of God. Every new breath you draw, is a new gift of God to you. How cau&s;ele&s;ly then are you &s;uch dreadful enemies to God? And how ju&s;tly, might God, for it, eternally deprive you of all mercy, &s;eeing you do thus requite God for his mercy and kind|ne&s;s to you?</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, how you would re&s;ent it, if others were &s;uch enemies to you, as you are to God. If they had their hearts &s;o full of enmity to you; if they treated you with &s;uch contempt, and oppo&s;ed you, as you do God; and injured you &s;o much as you do God, how would you re&s;ent it? Do you not find that you are apt greatly to re&s;ent it, when any oppo&s;e you, and &s;hew an ill &s;pirit towards you? And tho' you ex|cu&s;e your own enmity again&s;t God from your corrupt nature that you brought into the world with you, which
<PB N="162" REF="009961_0275_0F7B3E98DCCCA670">
you could not help; yet you do not excu&s;e others for being enemies to you f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om their corrupt nature that they brought into the world, which they could not help; but are ready bitterly to re&s;ent it notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider therefore, if you, a poor, unworthy, unlovely creature, do &s;o re&s;ent it, when you be not loved, but hated, how may God ju&s;tly re&s;ent it when you are enemies to him, an infinitely glorious Being; and a Being from whom you have received &s;o much kindne&s;s?</P>
<P N="3">3. How unrea&s;onable is it for you to imagine that you can oblige God to have re&s;pect to you by any thing that you can do, continuing &s;till to be his enemy. If you think you have prayed and read, and done con&s;i|derable for God; yet who cares for the &s;eeming kind|ne&s;s of an enemy?</P>
<P>What value would you your &s;elf &s;et upon it, if a man &s;hould &s;eem to carry it re&s;pectfully to you, with a fair face, talking &s;mooth, and making a &s;hew of friend&s;hip; when you knew at the &s;ame time, that he was inwardly your mortal enemy? Would you look upon your&s;elf obliged for &s;uch re&s;pect and kindne&s;s? Would you not rather abhor it? Would you count &s;uch re&s;pect to be valued, as Joab's towards Ama&s;a, who took him by the beard, and ki&s;&s;ed him, and &s;aid, Art thou in health my brother? and &s;mote him at the &s;ame time und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the fifth rib, and killed him?</P>
<P>What if you do pray to God? Is God obliged to hear the prayers of an enemy? What if you have taken a great deal of pains, is God obliged to give heaven for the prayers of an enemy? God may ju&s;tly abhor your prayers, and all that you do in religion, as the flattery of a mortal enemy. No wonder God does not accept any thing from the hands of an enemy.</P>
<P>INF. V. HENCE we may learn how wonderful is the love that is manife&s;ted in giving Chri&s;t to die for us. For this love is love to enemies. That is taken notice of in the text, "While we were ENEMIES, we
<PB N="163" REF="009961_0276_0F7B3E999F9B79F8">
were reconciled to God by the death of his Son." How wonderful was the love of God the Father in giving &s;uch a gift, to &s;uch, who not only were &s;uch as could not be profitable to him, and &s;uch as could merit nothing from him, and poor little worms of the du&s;t; but were his enemies, and enemies, to &s;o great a degree! They had that enmity that aimed at his life; yet &s;o did he love them, that he gave his own Son to lay down his own life, to &s;ave their lives. Tho' they had that enmity that &s;ought to pull God down out of his throne; yet God &s;o loved them, that he &s;ent down Chri&s;t from heaven, from his throne there, to be in the form of a &s;ervant; and in &s;tead of a throne of glory, gave him to be nailed to the cro&s;s, and to be laid in the grave, that &s;o we might be brought to a throne of glory.</P>
<P>How wonderful was the love of Chri&s;t, in thus ex|erci&s;ing <HI>dying love</HI> towards his enemies! That he &s;hould &s;o love tho&s;e that hated him, with hatred that &s;ought to take away his life; &s;o as voluntarily to lay down his life, that they might have life through him. "Herein is love; not that we loved him, but that he loved us, and laid down his life for us.</P>
<P>INF. VI. IF we are all naturally God's enemies, hence we may learn what a &s;pirit it becomes us to be of towards our enemies. Tho' we are enemies to God, yet we hope that God has loved us; and we hope that Chri&s;t has died for us; and we hope that God has for|given or will forgive us; and will do us good, and be|&s;tow infinite mercies and ble&s;&s;ings upon us, &s;o as to make us happy for ever. All this mercy, we hope has been, or will be exerci&s;ed towards us, while enemies.</P>
<P>Certainly then, it won't become us to be bitter in our &s;pirits again&s;t tho&s;e that are enemies to us, and have in|jured and ill treated us; and tho' they have yet an ill &s;pirit towards us. Seeing we depend &s;o much on God's forgiving us, tho' enemies, we &s;hould be of a &s;pirit of
<PB N="164" REF="009961_0277_0F7B3E99CD0D2020">
forgivene&s;s towards our enemies. And therefore our Saviour in&s;erted it in that prayer, which he dictated as a general directory to all; "Forgive us our debts, <HI>as we forgive our debtors,</HI>" to enforce the duty upon us, and to &s;hew us how rea&s;onable it is. And we ought to love them even while enemies; for &s;o we hope God hath done to us. We &s;hould be the children of our father, who is kind to the unthankful and evil. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luk. vi. 35.</NOTE></P>
<P>If we refu&s;e thus to do, and are of another &s;pirit, we may ju&s;tly expect that God will deny us his mercy, as he has threatned! "If ye forgive men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, your heavenly father will al&s;o forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your Father forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. vi. 14, 15.</NOTE> The &s;ame we have in the parable of the man, who owed his lord ten thou&s;and talents. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xviii. 23,&mdash;35.</NOTE></P>

<P>_THE apo&s;tle, in &s;peaking here in the context of the glorious doctrine of the redemption of &s;inners by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and how it was in a great mea&s;ure kept hid in the pa&s;t ages of the world; and that it was a my&s;tery that they did not under&s;tand, but now, was in a glorious manner brought to light. &vers;. 3, 4, 5. &mdash; "By revelation he made known unto me the my&s;tery, (as I wrote afore in few words; whereby when ye read ye may under&s;tand my knowledge in the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t) which in other ages was not made known unto the &s;ons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apo&s;tles and prophets, by the &s;pirit."

<P>And the apo&s;tle, in the text, informs us, that what Chri&s;t had accompli&s;hed towards his church, in the work of redemption, had not only in a great mea&s;ure unvail'd the my&s;tery to the church here in this world; but God had more clearly and fully opened it to the un|der&s;tanding, even of the angels them&s;elves: And that this was one end of God in it, to di&s;cover the glory of his wi&s;dom to the angels. "To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the church the manifold wi&s;dom of God."</P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve in the text,</P>

The excellent de&s;igns, hereby accom|pli&s;hed, are very manife&s;t. The wi&s;dom of God in this is of va&s;t extent. The contrivance is &s;o manifold, that one may &s;pend an eternity in di&s;covering more of the excellent ends and de&s;igns accompli&s;hed by it; and the multitude and va&s;t variety of things that are, by divine contrivance, brought to con&s;pire to the bringing about tho&s;e ends.</P>
<P N="3">3. We may ob&s;erve, <HI>to whom</HI> it is that God would manife&s;t this his wi&s;dom, by revealing the my&s;tery of our redemption; &mdash;and they are not only men, but the <HI>Angels.</HI> "To the intent that now unto the <HI>Principa|lities</HI> and <HI>Powers in heavenly places</HI> might be known&mdash;

the manifold wi&s;dom of God." The Angels are often called principalities and powers, which &s;eems to be be|cau&s;e of the exalted dignity of their nature The An|gels are of a very noble and excellent nature. They excel in &s;trength and wi&s;dom. Tho&s;e that are the wi&s;e men of the earth, are called princes in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ile of the apo&s;tle, 1 Cor. ii. 6. "Howbeit we &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">om among them that are perfect, yet not the wi&s;d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his world, nor of the princes of this world&mdash;&vers;. 8.

<P>One end of God in revealing his de&s;ign or contri|vance for redemption, as he hath &s;o fully and gloriou&s;ly done by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is that the angels in heaven may behold the glory of his wi&s;dom by it. Tho' they are &s;uch bright intelligencies, and do always behold the face of God the father, and know &s;o much; yet here is mat|ter of in&s;truction for them. Here they may &s;ee more of the divine wi&s;dom than ever they had &s;een before. It was a new di&s;covery of the wi&s;dom of God to them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Ob&s;erve the <HI>time</HI> when this di&s;play of the wi&s;dom of God was e&s;pecially made to the angels, and that is, when Chri&s;t introduced the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, implied in tho&s;e words, "To the intent that <HI>Now</HI> unto the

When Chri&s;t came into the world and died, and actually performed the work of redemp|tion, had fully and plainly revealed the coun&s;els of God concerning it; and accordingly introduced the evangelical di&s;pen&s;ation, and erected the go&s;pel church, &mdash;then the angels under&s;tood more of the my&s;tery of ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s redemption, and the manifold de&s;igns and coun|&s;els of divine wi&s;dom, than ever they had done before.</P>
<P>This is very plainly implied in the text and context.</P>
<P>In the foregoing ver&s;e, the apo&s;tle after &s;peaking of revealing of this wi&s;dom of God to man, "And to make all <HI>men</HI> &s;ee, what is the fellow&s;hip of this my&s;tery &amp;c.

<P>And this need not &s;eem &s;trange; for here is room enough for the angels to di&s;cover more and more to all eternity, of the wi&s;dom of God in this work. So mani|fold and infinite is the wi&s;dom thereof.</P>

<P>This is evidently taught in this text; for here it is mentioned as one end of God in revealing the contri|vance for our &s;alvation, that the angels thereby might &s;ee and know how great and manifold the wi&s;dom of God is; to hold forth the wonderfulne&s;s of divine wi&s;|dom to the angel's view and admiration. But why is it &s;o, if this wi&s;dom be not higher than their own wi&s;dom?

And in the</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t place. We will con&s;ider the choice of the per&s;on to be our redeemer. When God de&s;igned the redemp|tion of mankind, his great wi&s;dom appears in that he pitched upon his own, and only begotten Son, to be the per&s;on to perform the work. He was a redeemer of God's own choo&s;ing, and therefore he is called in &s;crip|ture. God's <HI>elect,</HI> (I&s;ai. 42 1.)

<P>He was every way a <HI>fit</HI> per&s;on for this undertaking. It was nece&s;&s;ary, that the per&s;on that is the redeemer, &s;hould be a <HI>divine</HI> per&s;on.

<P>It was requi&s;ite, that the per&s;on &s;hould be one that could act in this as of <HI>his own ab&s;olute right:</HI> one that, in him&s;elf, is not a &s;ervant or &s;ubject; becau&s;e, if he is one that cannot act of his own right, he cannot merit any thing.

Upon this account Chri&s;t is a fit per&s;on; and none but a divine per&s;on can be fit.</P>
<P>And he mu&s;t be a per&s;on al&s;o of infinite <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>love;</HI> for no other per&s;on but &s;uch an one would under|take a work &s;o difficult, for a creature &s;o unworthy as man. Upon this account al&s;o Chri&s;t is a fit per&s;on.</P>

<P>The wi&s;dom of God in chu&s;ing his eternal Son, ap|pears, not only in that he is a fit per&s;on; but in that he was the <HI>only</HI> fit per&s;on of all per&s;ons that are either created or uncreated. No <HI>created</HI> per|&s;on, neither man, nor angel, was fit for this under|taking; for we have ju&s;t now &s;hewn, that he mu&s;t be a per&s;on of <HI>infinite</HI> holine&s;s&mdash;dignity&mdash; power &mdash;wi&s;dom; infinitely dear to God&mdash;of infinite love and mercy; and one that may act of his own ab&s;olute right.

<P>There are three <HI>increated</HI> Per&s;ons, the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t; and Chri&s;t alone of the&s;e was a &s;ui|table per&s;on for a Redeemer.

<P>It was not meet it &s;hould be the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> for in being mediator between the Father and the &s;aints, he is in &s;ome &s;en&s;e &s;o between the Father and the Spirit. The &s;aints, in all their &s;piritual tran&s;actions with God, act by the Spirit: or rather, it is the Spirit of God, that acts in them: they are the temples of the holy Gho&s;t. The holy Spirit dwelling in them, is their principle of action, in all their tran&s;actings with God.</P>
<P>But in the&s;e their &s;piritual tran&s;actings with God, they act by a <HI>Mediator.</HI> The&s;e &s;piritual and holy exerci&s;es cannot be acceptable, or avail any thing with God, as from a fallen creature, but by a mediator. Therefore Chri&s;t, in being mediator between the Father and the &s;aints, may be &s;aid to be mediator between the Father and the holy Spirit, that acts in the &s;aints. And there|fore it was meet, that the mediator &s;hould not be either the Father or the Spirit, but a middle per&s;on between them both.</P>
<P>It is the Spirit in the &s;aints, that &s;eeks the ble&s;&s;ing of God, by faith and prayer; and, as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, with groanings that cannot be uttered, (<HI>Rom.</HI> 8.26.) <HI>Likewi&s;e the &s;pirit al&s;o helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we &s;hould pray for as we ought; but the &s;pirit it &s;elf maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us, with groan|ings that cannot be uttered.</HI> The &s;pirit in the &s;aints &s;eeks divine ble&s;&s;ings of God, by and thro' a mediator: and therefore that mediator mu&s;t not be the &s;pirit, but another per&s;on.</P>
<P>It &s;hews a <HI>divine</HI> wi&s;dom, to <HI>know</HI> that he was a fit per&s;on. No other but one of <HI>divine</HI> wi&s;dom could have known it. None but one of infinite wi&s;dom could have thought of him to be a redeemer of &s;inners.

Who would ever have thought of him as one that &s;hould &s;et his heart upon man, and exerci&s;e infinite love and pity to him, &mdash; and infinite wi&s;dom and power and merit in redeeming him! We proceed</P>
<P N="2">2. To con&s;ider the &s;ub&s;tituting this per&s;on in our room. After the choo&s;ing the per&s;on to be our redee|mer, the next &s;tep of divine wi&s;dom, is, in contriving the way how he &s;hould perform this work. If God had declared who the per&s;on was, that his wi&s;dom had pitched upon, to do this work, and had gone no further, there is no creature could have thought which way this per&s;on could have performed the work. If God had told them, that his own Son mu&s;t be the Redeemer; and that he alone was a fit per&s;on for the work: and that he was a per&s;on every way fit &amp; &s;ufficient for it,&mdash; but had propo&s;ed to them to have contriv'd a way how this fit and &s;ufficient per&s;on &s;hould do the work, &mdash; Here we may well &s;uppo&s;e that all created under&s;tand|ings would have been utterly at a lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary to be done, is that this Son of God &s;hould become our repre&s;entative and &s;urety; and &s;o be &s;ub&s;tituted in the &s;inner's room. But who of created intelligences would have tho't of any &s;uch thing as the eternal and infinitely beloved Son of God his being &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of &s;inners! His &s;tand|ing in &s;tead of a &s;inner, a rebel, an object of the wrath of God! And &s;hould in the &s;inner's &s;tead place him&s;elf in the woful circum&s;tances, that he has brought him&s;elf into, by &s;in! Who would have thought of a per&s;on, that was the eternal God, a per&s;on of infinite glory, his undertaking to &s;tand before God, as repre&s;enting &s;inful worms, that had made them&s;elves by &s;in infinitely provoking and abominable!</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="009961_0287_0F7B3EA13780C938">For, if the Son of God be &s;ub&s;tituted in the &s;inner's room, then his &s;in mu&s;t be charged upon him: He will thereby take the guilt of the &s;inner upon him&s;elf; and all that was due to the &s;inner for his &s;in, becomes now due to him; and he mu&s;t be &s;ubject to the &s;ame law that man was, both as to the commands, and threatnings: but who would have thought of any &s;uch thing concern|ing the Son of God! Who would have thought, that it was fit to be, or could be! But we proceed,</P>
<P N="3">3. To con&s;ider the incarnation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The next &s;tep of divine wi&s;dom in contriving how Chri&s;t &s;hould perform the work of redeeming &s;inners, was in determining his incarnation. If God had reveal'd his coun&s;els thus far to created under&s;tandings, not only that his own Son was the per&s;on he had pitched upon, for this work, but al&s;o that he had &s;ub&s;tituted him in the &s;inner's room; and appointed him to repre&s;ent the &s;inner, and to become his &s;urety; and &s;o to take the &s;inner's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ligations and guilt on him&s;elf:&mdash;and had re|veal'd no more, but had left the re&s;t to them to find ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is no way probable, that even then they could ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave thought of a way, whereby this per&s;on might actually h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve performed the work of redemption. For if the Son of God be &s;ub&s;tituted in the &s;inner's &s;tead, then the Son of God takes the &s;inner's obligations on him&s;elf: as for in&s;tance; he mu&s;t take the obligation the &s;inner is under to perform perfect obedience to the divine law. But it is not probable, that any creature could have conceiv'd how that could be po&s;&s;ible. How &s;hould a per&s;on that is the eternal JEHOVAH, become a &s;ervant, be under law, and perform obedience to the law of man!</P>
<P>And again, if the Son of God be &s;ub&s;tituted in the &s;inner's &s;tead, then he comes under the &s;inner's obliga|tion to &s;uffer the puni&s;hment, which man's &s;in had de|&s;erved. And who could have thought that to have been po&s;&s;ible! For how &s;hould a divine per&s;on, who is e&s;&s;en|tially,
<PB N="175" REF="009961_0288_0F7B3EA39994ACF0">
unchangeably, and infinitely happy, &s;uffer pain and torment! And how &s;hould he that is the object of God's infinitely dear love, &s;uffer the wrath of his father!</P>
<P>It is not to be &s;uppos'd, that created wi&s;dom ever would have found out a way how to have got over the&s;e difficulties. But divine wi&s;dom hath found out a way, viz. by the incarnation of the Son of God. That the word &s;hould be made fle&s;h, that he might be both God and man, in one per&s;on: what created under&s;tanding could have thought or conceived of &s;uch a thing as that! or could have conceiv'd that &s;uch a thing was po&s;&s;ible!</P>
<P>And if God had reveal'd to them, that it was po&s;&s;ible, and that it <HI>&s;hould be,</HI> but left them to find out <HI>how</HI> it &s;hould be; &mdash; how may we well &s;uppo&s;e that they would all have been puzzled and confounded, to con|ceive of a way for &s;o uniting a man to the eternal Son of God, that they &s;hould be one per&s;on: that one that is truly a man in all re&s;pects, as truly and properly a man as any man, &s;hould indeed and in truth, be the very &s;ame Son of God, that is God, and was with God from all eternity. This is a great my&s;tery to us. Hereby, a per&s;on that is infinite, omnipotent and un|changeable, is become a finite, a feeble man: a man &s;ubject to our &s;inle&s;s infirmities, pa&s;&s;ions and calamities! The great God, the &s;overeign of heaven and earth, is become a worm of the du&s;t. (P&s;al. 22.6) "I am a worm, and no man." He that is eternal and &s;elf ex|i&s;tent, is born of a woman as the re&s;t of us are! He that is the great original &s;pirit is clothed with fle&s;h &amp; blood like one of us! He that is independent &amp; &s;elf-&s;ufficient and all-&s;ufficient, that &s;upplies all creatures out of his boun|tiful hand; &mdash;he now is come to &s;tand in need of food and cloathing to keep him alive: He becomes poor, "has not where to lay his head;"&mdash; &s;tands in need of the charity of men; and is maintain'd by it! It is far above us, to conceive how it is done. It is a great wonder and my&s;tery to us: but it was no my&s;tery to divine wi&s;dom.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="176" REF="009961_0289_0F7B3EA45F2D7200">4. The next thing to be con&s;idered, is the life of Chri&s;t in this world. The wi&s;dom of God appears in the circum&s;tances of his life&mdash;and in the work and bu|&s;ine&s;s of his life. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. The circum&s;tances of his life. If God had re|veal'd that his own Son, &s;hould be incarnate, and &s;hould live in this world, in the human nature; and it had been left to men to determine what circum&s;tances of life would have been mo&s;t &s;uitable for the Son of God to appear in here,&mdash;human wi&s;dom would have determin'd, that he &s;hould appear in the world in a mo&s;t magni|ficent manner; with very extraordinary outward en|&s;igns of honor, authority and power far above any of the kings of the earth: that here he &s;hould reign in great vi&s;ible pomp and &s;plendor over all nations.&mdash;And thus it was that men's wi&s;dom did determine, before Chri&s;t came. The wi&s;e, great men among the jews, &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, who are called "princes of this world;" did expect that the me&s;&s;iah would thus appear. But the wi&s;dom of God cho&s;e quite otherwi&s;e: It cho&s;e that when the Son of God was incarnate and be|came man, he &s;hould begin his life in a &s;table; that he &s;hould for many years dwell ob&s;curely in a family of low degree in the world; and afterwards &s;hould be in low outward circum&s;tances: that he &s;hould be poor, and not have where to lay his head; &mdash;that he &s;hould be maintained by the charity of &s;ome of his di&s;ciples;&mdash; That he &s;hould "grow up as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground," (<HI>I&s;a.</HI> 53.2.) "That he &s;hould not cry, nor lift up, nor cau&s;e his voice to he heard in the &s;treets," (<HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 42.2.) That he &s;hould come to Zion in a lowly manner, "riding on an a&s;s, and a colt the fole of an a&s;s."&mdash;"That he &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men, a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted with grief."</P>
<P>And now the <HI>divine</HI> determination in this matter is made known, we may &s;afely conclude that it is far the
<PB N="177" REF="009961_0290_0F7B3EA4F9632980">
mo&s;t &s;uitable: and that it would not have been at all &s;uitable for God, when he was manife&s;t in fle&s;h to ap|pear with earthly pomp, wealth and grandeur, as tho' he affected &s;uch things as the&s;e. No! the&s;e things are infinitely too mean, and de&s;picable. For the Son of God to &s;hew as if he affected or e&s;teemed them.</P>
<P>Men, if they had had this way propo&s;ed to them of the eternal Son of God, appearing on earth, viz. in &s;uch mean, low circum&s;tances, would have been ready to condemn it, as fooli&s;h and very un&s;uitable for the Son of God. "But the fooli&s;hne&s;s of God is wi&s;er than men," (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.25.) "And God hath brought to nought the wi&s;dom of this world, and the princes of this world," (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.6.)</P>
<P>CHRIST, by thus appearing in mean and low out|ward circum&s;tances in the world, has poured contempt upon all worldly wealth and glory; and has taught us to de&s;pi&s;e it. It is becoming of chri&s;tians to be above the&s;e things and to de&s;pi&s;e them. And if it becomes mean men to de&s;pi&s;e them, how much more did it be|come the Son of God! And then Chri&s;t hereby hath taught us to be lowly in heart. We &s;ee hereby how lowly that Per&s;on was, that was infinitely high &amp; great. How lowly then &s;hould we be, who are indeed &s;o low &amp; vile.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. The wi&s;dom of God appears in the work and bu&s;ine&s;s of the life of Chri&s;t. That he &s;hould perfectly obey the law of God, under &s;uch great temptations: That he &s;hould have conflicted with and overcome, for us, in a way of obedience, the powers of earth &amp; hell: That he &s;hould be &s;ubject to, not only the <HI>moral</HI> law, but the <HI>ceremonial</HI> al&s;o, that heavy yoke of bondage.</P>
<P>CHRIST went thro' the time of his public mini&s;try, in delivering to us divine in&s;tructions and doctrines. The wi&s;dom of God appears in giving us &s;uch an one to be our prophet and teacher, who is a divine per&s;on:
<PB N="178" REF="009961_0291_0F7B3EA5D80E2848">
who is him&s;elf the very wi&s;dom and word of God: And was from all eternity in the bo&s;om of the Father:&mdash; that he &s;hould find &s;uch an one to teach us: His word will tend to be of greater authority and weight than if delivered by the mouth of an ordinary prophet. And then it is wi&s;ely ordered that the &s;ame &s;hould be our teacher, that is our redeemer: that his relations and offices, as redeemer, might the more &s;weeten and endear his in&s;tructions to us. We are ready to give heed to things that are &s;aid by one that is dear to us. Our love to their per&s;ons make us to delight in their di&s;cour&s;e. It is therefore wi&s;ely ordered, that he that has done &s;o much to endear him&s;elf to us, &s;hould be appointed our great prophet to deliver to us divine doctrines.</P>
<P N="5">5. The next thing to be con&s;idered is the death of Chri&s;t. The only begotten Son of God his dying, is a means of &s;alvation for poor &s;inners, that no other but divine wi&s;dom would have pitched upon. And when it was revealed, was doubtle&s;s greatly to the &s;urprize of all the ho&s;ts of heaven. This is what they admired with great admiration when they &s;aw it; and never will cea&s;e to wonder at. And how a&s;toni&s;hing is it, that a per&s;on that is ble&s;&s;ed for ever, and is infinitely and e&s;&s;en|tially happy, &s;hould endure the greate&s;t &s;ufferings that ever was endured on earth! That a per&s;on that is the &s;upreme lord and judge of the world, &s;hould be ar|raign'd, and &s;hould &s;tand at the judgment &s;eat of mortal worms, and then be condemned. That a per&s;on that is the living God, and the fountain of life, &s;hould be put to death. That a per&s;on that created the world, and gives life to all his creatures, &s;hould be put to death by his own creatures. That a per&s;on that is one of infinite maje&s;ty and glory, and &s;o the object of the love&punc; prai&s;es and adorations of angels, &s;hould be mocked and &s;pit upon by the vile&s;t of men. That a per&s;on that is infinitely good, and that is love it &s;elf,
<PB N="179" REF="009961_0292_0F7B3EA68172ED08">
&s;hould &s;uffer the greate&s;t cruelty. That a per&s;on that is infinitely beloved of the father, &s;hould be put to in|expre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h under his own father's wrath. That he that is king of heaven, hath heaven for his throne, and the earth for his foot&s;tool, &s;hould be buried in the pri&s;on of the grave.</P>
<P>How wonderful a thing is this! and who would ever have thought of any &s;uch thing coming to pa&s;s. But yet this is the way that God's wi&s;dom hath pitched upon, as the way of &s;inners &s;alvation: and this not un|&s;uitable, or any di&s;honour to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">6. The la&s;t thing done to procure &s;alvation for &s;in|ners, that we &s;hall here con&s;ider, is Chri&s;t's exaltation. Divine wi&s;dom &s;aw it needful or mo&s;t expedient, that the &s;ame per&s;on that was incarnate, and that died upon the cro&s;s, &s;hould &s;it on his own right hand, on his own throne as &s;upreme Governor of the world; and &s;hould have particularly the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al of all things re|lating to man's &s;alvation, and &s;hould be the judge of the world. This was needful, becau&s;e it was re|qui&s;ite that the &s;ame per&s;on that purchas'd &s;alvation, &s;hould have the be&s;towing of it; for it is not fit, that God &s;hould at all tran&s;act with the fallen creature in a way of mercy, but by a mediator. And this is exceed|ingly for the &s;trengthning of the faith &amp; comfort of the &s;aints, that he that hath indured &s;o much to purcha&s;e &s;alvation for them, has all things in heaven, &amp; in earth delivered unto him; that he might be&s;tow eternal life to them that he purcha&s;ed it for. And that the &s;ame per&s;on that loved them &s;o greatly, as to &s;hed his pre|cious blood for them, was to be their judge, who&s;e &s;en|tence there could be no rever&s;ing.</P>
<P>But this was another thing full of wonders, that he that was man as well as God; he that was a &s;ervant, and
<PB N="180" REF="009961_0293_0F7B3EA74CEAEA50">
died like a malefactor; that this per&s;on not exclu&s;ive of the human nature, &s;hould be exalted to be made the &s;overeign lord of heaven and earth, angels and men; the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;er of eternal life and death; the &s;u|preme judge of all created intelligent beings, for eternity: and &s;hould have committed to him, all the governing power of God the Father; and that, not only as God; but as God-man, not exclu&s;ive of the human nature.</P>
<P>As it is wonderful, that a per&s;on that is <HI>divine</HI> &s;hould be humbled, &s;o as to become a &s;ervant, and to &s;uffer as a malefactor: &s;o it is in like manner wonderful, the other way, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he that is God-man, not exclu&s;ive of the man hood, &s;hould be exalted to the power &amp; honor of the great God of heaven and earth.

<P>GOD has greatly glorified him&s;elf in the work of creation;&mdash; and in many of his other works of provi|dence: but above all, is he glorified in this work of redemption. All God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s works do prai&s;e him. His glory &s;hines brightly from them all: but as &s;ome &s;tars differ from others in glory, &s;o the glory of God &s;hines brigh|ter in &s;ome of his works than in others.

enjoyment of God. This is a more glorious demon&s;tra|tion of divine power, than creating things out of nothing, upon two accounts. One is, the <HI>effect is greater and more excellent.</HI> To produce the new creature is a more glorious effect, than meerly to produce a creature. The making a holy creature, a creature in the &s;piritual image of God; in the image of the divine excellencies, and a partaker of the divine nature &mdash; is a greater effect than meerly to give being to a thing. And therefore as the effect is greater, it is a more glorious manife&s;tation of power.</P>
<P>And then, upon another account al&s;o is it a more glorious manife&s;tation of divine power, and that is, that in this effect of the actual redemption of &s;inners, <HI>the term from which, is more di&s;tant from the term to which,</HI> than in the work of creation. The term from which, in the work of creation is <HI>nothing,</HI> and the term to which, is <HI>being.</HI> But the term from which, in the work of redemption, is a &s;tate infinitely wor&s;e than nothing; and the term to which, a holy and a happy being, a &s;tate infinitely better than mere being. The terms in the production of the la&s;t, are much more remote from one another, than in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>And then the production of this la&s;t effect, is a more glorious manife&s;tation of power, than the work of creation; becau&s;e, tho' in creation the terms are very di&s;tant: nothing is very remote from being; yet there is no oppo&s;ition. The power of God in producing that effect is not oppo&s;ed. Nothing, makes no oppo&s;ition to the creating power of God. But in redemption, the power of God meets with and overcomes great oppo&s;i|tion. There is great oppo&s;ition in a &s;tate of &s;in to a &s;tate of grace. Men's lu&s;ts and corruptions are ex|ceeding oppo&s;ite to grace and holine&s;s; and do greatly re&s;i&s;t the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oduction of the effect. This oppo&s;ition is overcome in actual redemption.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="009961_0296_0F7B3EA9D9750760">And be&s;ides, there is great oppo&s;ition from &s;atan. The power of God is very glorious in this work, be|cau&s;e it therein conquers the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t power|ful enemies, making the mo&s;t violent oppo&s;ition they are capable of. Power never appears more illu&s;trious than in conquering. Je&s;us Chri&s;t in this work, conquers and triumphs over thou&s;ands of devils, &s;trong and mighty &s;pirits, uniting all their &s;trength again&s;t him. <HI>Luk.</HI> xi. 21.

"And having &s;poiled principalities &amp; powers, he made a &s;hew of them openly, triumphing over them in the cro&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">(3) The ju&s;tice of God is exceedingly glorified in this work. God is &s;o &s;trictly and immutably ju&s;t, that he would not &s;pare his Son when he took upon him the guilt of men's &s;ins, and was &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of &s;inners; he &s;pared him not at all. He would not abate him the lea&s;t mite of that debt which ju&s;tice demanded. Ju&s;tice &s;hould take place, tho' it co&s;t his infinitely dear Son his precious blood; and his enduring &s;uch extra|ordinary reproach &amp; pain &amp; death in it's mo&s;t dreadful form Such was God's ju&s;tice, that his love to his own Son would not influence him to abate the lea&s;t of what ju&s;tice required.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The holine&s;s of God is al&s;o exceeding glorious in this work. Never did God &s;o manife&s;t his hatred of &s;in as in the death &amp; &s;ufferings of his only begotten Son. Hereby he &s;hew'd him&s;elf unappea&s;able to &s;in. And that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to be at peace with it.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) God hath al&s;o exceedingly glorified his truth in this way, both in his threatnings and promi&s;es. Herein is fulfilled the threatenings of the law, wherein God &s;aid, "in the day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die." "And cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in
<PB N="184" REF="009961_0297_0F7B3CAB9EC4B198">
all things written in the book of the law to do them." God &s;hew'd hereby, that not only heaven &amp; earth &s;hould pa&s;s away,&mdash;but, which is a great deal more, that the blood of him, who is the eternal Jehovah, &s;hould be &s;pilt, rather than one jot, or tittle of his word &s;hould fail, till all be fulfilled.</P>
<P N="6">(6) And la&s;tly, E&s;pecially has God exceedingly glo|rified his mercy and love, in this work. The mercy of God was an attribute never &s;een before, in the exer|ci&s;es of it, till it was &s;een in this work of redemption, or the fruits of it. The goodne&s;s of God appeared towards the angels in giving them being and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. It appeared glorious towards man in his primitive &s;tate, a &s;tate of holine&s;s and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But now God hath &s;hewn that he can find in his heart, to love &s;inners, tho&s;e that de&s;erve his infinite ha|tred: that have provoked him by rebellion again&s;t him; and that are enemies to him. And not only hath he &s;hewn that he can love them, but love them &s;o as to give them more and do greater things for them than ever he did for the holy angels, that never &s;inned or offended their creator. He loved &s;inful men &s;o as to give them a greater gift than ever he gave the angels: &s;o as to give his own Son, and not only to give him to be their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment; but to give him to be their &s;acrifice. And herein he has done more for them, than if he had given them all the vi&s;ible world; yea more, than if he had given them all the angels, and all heaven be&s;ides.</P>
<P>GOD hath loved them &s;o, that hereby he purcha&s;ed for them, deliverance from eternal mi&s;ery, and the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of immortal glory.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Each per&s;on of the trinity is exceedingly glo|rified in this work This is a thing wherein the work of redemption is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the other works of God. The attributes of God are glorious in other works of God: but the three per&s;ons of the trinity are
<PB N="185" REF="009961_0298_0F7B3CAC54219C38">
di&s;tinctly glorified in no work as in this work of redemp|tion. In this work every di&s;tinct per&s;on has his di&s;tinct parts and offices a&s;&s;igned him. Each one has his par|ticular and di&s;tinct concern in it, agreeable to their di|&s;tinct, per&s;onal properties &amp; relations &amp; oecomical offices.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons of the trinity are each of them, di&s;tinctly and equally glorified in this work. The redeemed have an equal concern with and dependance upon each per|&s;on, in this affair, and owe equal honor and prai&s;e to each of them.</P>
<P>The Father appoints and provides the Redeemer, and accepts the price of redemption. The Son is the Re|deemer and the price. He redeems by offering up him|&s;elf. The Holy Gho&s;t immediately communicates to us the thing purcha&s;ed: yea, and he is the good pur|cha&s;ed. The &s;um of what Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed for us is holine&s;s &amp; happine&s;s. But the Holy Gho&s;t is the great principle both of all holine&s;s &amp; happine&s;s. The Holy Gho&s;t is the &s;um of all that Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed for men. <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 13, 14. "He was made a cur&s;e for us, that we might receive the promi&s;e of the &s;pirit, thro' faith.</P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the redeemed con&s;i&s;ts in parta|king of Chri&s;t's fulne&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ts in partaking of that Spirit, which is given not by mea&s;ure unto him. This is the oil that was poured upon the head of the Church&punc; which ran down to the members of his body; to the &s;ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts of his garment.</P>
<P>Thus we have an equal concern with, and depen|dance upon each of the per&s;ons of the trinity, di&s;tinctly; upon the Father, as he that provides the Redeemer, and the Per&s;on of whom the purcha&s;e is made; &mdash; the Son as the purcha&s;er, and the price; the Holy Gho&s;t as the good purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P>[Thus we have con&s;idered how God is glorified in this work; which is part of the good obtained in the work of Redemption.]</P>
<P>We proceed now</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="186" REF="009961_0299_0F7B3CAD095BEB78">II. To con&s;ider the wi&s;dom of God appearing in the variety, and exceeding greatne&s;s of the good that is hereby procured for <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P>Here we may di&s;tinctly con&s;ider &mdash; The variety&mdash;and the greatne&s;s of the good procured for men.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here are all &s;orts of good procured for fallen man, that he <HI>does</HI> or <HI>can</HI> &s;tand in need of, or is <HI>capable</HI> of. The wi&s;dom of God appears in the way of &s;alvation in that it is &s;o &s;ufficient a way. Herein it is mo&s;t worthy of an infinitely wi&s;e God, as it is every way perfect and &s;ufficient, and an&s;wers all our needs.</P>
<P>We in our fallen &s;tate are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;itous creatures, full of our wants: but they are all an&s;wered in this way of &s;alvation. Every &s;ort of good is here procured. Every thing that would really contribute to our happi|ne&s;s that we can think of, and a great many things we could not have thought of, had not Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed them for us, and revealed them to us. Every demand of our circum&s;tances, and craving of our natures, is here exactly an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, As for in&s;tance, we &s;tand in need of <HI>peace</HI> with God. We had provoked God to anger, and the wrath of God abode upon us, and we needed to have it ap|pea&s;ed. This is done for us in this way of &s;alvation. Chri&s;t, by &s;hedding his blood, has fully &s;atisfied ju&s;tice, and appea&s;ed God's wrath, for all that &s;hall be|lieve in him. We were by the &s;entence of the law con|demned to hell. We needed to have our &s;ins pardoned that we might be delivered from hell. In this work, pardon of &s;in, &amp; deliverance from hell, is purcha&s;ed for us.</P>
<P>Secondly, We needed not only to have God's wrath appea&s;ed, and our &s;ins pardoned; but we needed to have the <HI>favour</HI> of God. To have God, not only not our enemy, but our friend. God's favour is al&s;o purcha&s;ed for us by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="009961_0300_0F7B3CADC3E8E678">Thirdly, We needed not only to be delivered from hell, but to have &s;ome <HI>&s;atisfying happine&s;s</HI> be&s;towed. Man is of &s;uch a nature, that he has a natural craving and thir&s;t after happine&s;s. And will thir&s;t and crave, till his ca|pacity is fill'd. And his capacity is of va&s;t extent; and nothing but an infinite good can fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> it, and &s;atisfy his de&s;ires. But notwith&s;tanding, provi&s;ion is made in this way of &s;alvation to an&s;wer tho&s;e needs of our &s;ouls. And there is a &s;atisfying happine&s;s purcha&s;ed for us: that which is fully an&s;werable to the capacity and crav|ings of our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Here is food procured in this way of &s;alvation to an&s;|wer all our appetites and faculties of our &s;ouls. God has made the &s;oul of man of a &s;piritual nature; and therefore he needs a &s;piritual happine&s;s: &s;ome &s;piritual object, in the enjoyment of which he may be happy. And in this way of &s;alvation, there is good procured, that is &s;uitable to this &s;piritual nature of man, a &s;pirit. Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed the enjoyment of God, as the por|tion of our &s;ouls, &mdash;who is the great and original Spirit. And he hath purcha&s;ed the Spirit of God to come and dwell in us to be an internal principle of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>GOD hath made man a rational, intelligent creature. And man needs &s;ome good, that &s;hall be a &s;uitable ob|ject of his under&s;tanding, for him to contemplate; where|in he may have full and &s;ufficient exerci&s;e for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> capa|cious faculties, in the utmo&s;t extent of them: or in the utmo&s;t extent they are capable of; &mdash; an object that is great and noble, and worthy of the exerci&s;e of the no|ble&s;t faculties of the rational &s;oul.</P>
<P>Provi&s;ion is made for this al&s;o, in this way of &s;alva|tion. Here it is provided that God him&s;elf &s;hould be theirs, for them forever to behold &amp; contemplate; who&s;e glorious perfections and works are mo&s;t worthy objects of the improvement of their faculties: And there is room enough for them to improve them, and &s;till to exerci&s;e their faculties to all eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="009961_0301_0F7B3CAEC860C298">And what object can be more worthy to exerci&s;e the under&s;tanding of a rational &s;oul, than the glories of the divine being, with which the heavenly intelligencies, and the infinite under&s;tanding of God him&s;elf is entertain'd!</P>
<P>Our &s;ouls need &s;ome good that &s;hall be a &s;uitable object of the will and affections: a &s;uitable object for the choice, the acquie&s;cence, the love and joy of the ra|tional &s;oul. Provi&s;ion is made for this al&s;o in this way of &s;alvation. There is an infinitely excellent Being of|fered to be cho&s;en, to be re&s;ted in, to be loved, to be rejoyced in, by us: even God him&s;elf, who is infinitely lovely, the fountain of all good; a fountain that can never be exhau&s;ted, where we can be in no danger of going to exce&s;s, in our love and joy: and may be a&s;&s;ur|ed ever to find our joy and delight in the enjoyment an&s;werable to our love and de&s;ires.</P>
<P>Fourthly. There is all po&s;&s;ible enjoyment of this object procured in this way of &s;alvation. When per&s;ons entirely &s;et their love upon another they naturally de|&s;ire to <HI>&s;ee</HI> that per&s;on: meerly to here of the per&s;on, don't &s;atisfy love. So here is provi&s;ion made that we &s;hould &s;ee God, the object of our &s;upreme love. Not only that we &s;hould hear and read of him in his word, but that we &s;hould &s;ee him with a &s;piritual eye here: and not only &s;o, but that we &s;hould have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing God face to face, hereafter. This is promi&s;ed (<HI>Mat.</HI> 5.8) <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in Heart; for they &s;hall &s;ee God.</HI> It is promi&s;ed, that we &s;hall not &s;ee God, as thro' a gla&s;s darkly, as we do now, but face to face. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.12. That we &s;hall &s;ee Chri&s;t as he is. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.2.</P>
<P>We naturally de&s;ire not only to &s;ee tho&s;e that we love, but to <HI>conver&s;e with</HI> them. Provi&s;ion is made for this al&s;o, that we &s;hould have &s;piritual conver&s;ation with God while here in this world; and that we &s;hould be hereafter admitted to conver&s;e with Chri&s;t in the mo&s;t

Provi&s;ion is made in this way of &s;alvation, that we &s;hould conver&s;e with God much more intimately, than otherwi&s;e it would have been po&s;&s;ible for us; for now Chri&s;t is incarnate, he is in our nature: he is become one of us; whereby we are under advan|tages for an immen&s;ely more free and intimate conver|&s;ation with him, than could have been, if he had re|main'd only in the divine nature; and &s;o in a nature infinitely di&s;tant from us.</P>
<P>We naturally de&s;ire not only to conver&s;e with tho&s;e that we greatly love, but to <HI>dwell with</HI> them. Provi|&s;ion, thro' Chri&s;t, is made for this It is purcha&s;ed and provided that we &s;hould dwell with God in his own hou&s;e in heaven, which is called our father's hou&s;e.&mdash; To dwell for ever in God's pre&s;ence, and at his right hand.</P>
<P>We naturally de&s;ire to have a <HI>right</HI> to that per&s;on that we greatly love. Provi&s;ion is made in this way of &s;alvation, that we &s;hould have a right <HI>in</HI> God; a right <HI>to</HI> him. This is the promi&s;e of the covenant of grace, "That he will be our God.

<P>And we way al&s;o hereby challenge a right to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash; Love de&s;ires that the right &s;hould be <HI>mutual.</HI> The lover, de&s;ires not only to have a right to the beloved, but <HI>that the beloved &s;hould al&s;o have a right to him:</HI> he de&s;ires to be his beloved's, as well as his beloved &s;hould be his. Provi&s;ion is al&s;o made for this, in this wi&s;e method of &s;alvation,&mdash;that God &s;hould have a &s;pecial propriety in tho&s;e that are redeemed, that they &s;hould be in a di&s;tingui&s;hing manner <HI>his:</HI> that they

<P>Love de&s;ires to &s;tand in &s;ome <HI>near relation</HI> to the beloved. Provi&s;ion is made by Chri&s;t, that we &s;hould &s;tand in the neare&s;t po&s;&s;ible relation to God, that God &s;hould be our father; and we &s;hould be his children. We are often in&s;tructed in the word of God, that God is the father of believers, and that they are his family.</P>
<P>And not only &s;o, but they &s;tand in the neare&s;t relation to Chri&s;t Je&s;us. There is the clo&s;e&s;t union po&s;&s;ible. The &s;ouls of believers are married to Chri&s;t. The church is the bride the lamb's wife. Yea, there is yet a nearer relation than can be repre&s;ented by &s;uch a &s;imi|litude as this. Believers are as the very members of Chri&s;t, and of his fle&s;h and of his bones, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.30. Yea, this is not near enough yet, but "they are one &s;pi|rit." 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.17.</P>
<P>Love naturally inclines to a <HI>conformity</HI> to the belov|ed. To have tho&s;e excellencies, upon the account of which he is beloved, copied in him&s;elf. Provi&s;ion is made in this way of &s;alvation, that we may be conformed to God; that we &s;hall be transformed into the &s;ame image. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.18. <HI>We all with open face, beholding as in a gla&s;s, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image from glory to glory.</HI>&mdash;And that hereafter we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is, and be like him.</P>
<P>It is the natural de&s;ire of love to <HI>do &s;omething</HI> for the beloved, either for his plea&s;ure or honour. Provi&s;ion is made for this al&s;o in this way of &s;alvation; that we &s;hould be made in&s;truments of glorifying God, and pro|moting his kingdom here, and of glorifying him to all eternity.</P>

<P>Eightly, There is provi&s;ion made in this way of &s;al|vation for the life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of &s;oul &amp; body <HI>to all eternity.</HI> Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed that we &s;hould be deli|vered
<PB N="193" REF="009961_0306_0F7B3CB23A3828D8">
from a &s;tate of temporal death, as well as <HI>&s;piritual</HI> and <HI>eternal.</HI> He has purcha&s;ed that the bodies of the &s;aints &s;hall be rai&s;ed to a re&s;urrection of life. He has purcha&s;ed all manner of perfection for the body that it is capable of; that it &s;hall be rai&s;ed a &s;piritual body, in incorruption, and glory: and be made like Chri&s;t's glo|rious body, and &s;hine as the &s;un in the kingdom of his father. And that it &s;hould be glorified with the &s;oul and exi&s;t in a glorified e&s;tate in union with the &s;oul to all eternity.</P>
<P>Ninthly. But man in his fallen &s;tate &s;till needs &s;ome|thing el&s;e in order to his happine&s;s, than that the&s;e fore|mentioned &s;hould be purcha&s;ed for him. i. e. He needs to be <HI>qualified</HI> for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of them. In order to our having a title to the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant of grace, there is a certain condition mu&s;t be performed by us. We mu&s;t believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and accept of him as offered in the go&s;pel, for a Saviour. But this we cannot do of our &s;elves.&mdash; But Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed this al&s;o for all the elect. He has purcha&s;ed that they &s;hall have faith given them; where|by they &s;hall be united to Chri&s;t, and &s;o have a title to his benefits.</P>
<P>But &s;till &s;omething further is nece&s;&s;ary for man, in order to his coming to the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the inhe|ritance. A man, as &s;oon as he has believed, has a title to the inheritance: but in order to come to the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, he mu&s;t per&s;evere in a way of holine&s;s. There is not only a gate that mu&s;t be entered; but there is a narrow way that mu&s;t be travel'd before we can arrive at heavenly ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and that is a way of univer&s;al and per&s;evering holine&s;s. But men after they have believed, cannot per&s;evere in a way of holine&s;s, of them&s;elves. But there is &s;ufficient provi&s;ion made for this al&s;o, in the way of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The
<PB N="194" REF="009961_0307_0F7B3CB3FA9EF540">
matter of a &s;aint's per&s;everance is &s;ufficiently &s;ecured by the purcha&s;e that Chri&s;t has made.</P>
<P>But &s;till there is &s;omething el&s;e needful in order to qualify a per&s;on for the actual entering upon the en|joyments and employments of a glorified e&s;tate, viz. that he &s;hould be made perfectly holy: that all remainders of &s;in &s;hould be taken away; for there can't any &s;in enter into heaven. No &s;oul mu&s;t go into the glorious pre|&s;ence of God, with the lea&s;t degree of the filth of &s;in. But there is provi&s;ion made; for Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed that all &s;in &s;hall be taken away out of the hearts of be|lievers at death; and that they &s;hould be made perfectly holy: whereby they &s;hall be fully and perfectly quali|fied to enter upon the plea&s;ures and enjoyments of the new Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>CHRIST has purcha&s;ed all both objective and inhe|rent good: not only a portion to be enjoyed by us; but all tho&s;e inherent qualifications nece&s;&s;ary to our enjoy|ment of it. He has purcha&s;ed not only ju&s;tification, but &s;anctification and glorification; both holine&s;s and happi|ne&s;s.</P>

<P>To &s;hew that it was a wi&s;e way, we propo&s;ed to con|&s;ider two things</P>

<PB N="198" REF="009961_0311_0F7B3CB6C1B96418">
to con&s;ider two things. 1. How great and mani|fold the good ends are that are obtained by it. 2. The wonderful circum&s;tances of the attainment.</P>
<P N="1">(1) How great and manifold the good ends are, that are attained by it, as they relate &mdash;to God&mdash; to men&mdash; to angels&mdash;and devils. 1. How God is glorified hereby. 2. What good is procured for men. 3. What benefits the angels have hereby. 4. How &s;atan is overthrown.</P>
<P>Having in the preceeding Sermon con&s;idered &mdash; the glory that is brought to God&mdash;and the good that is pro|cured for man. I proceed,</P>
<P N="3">III. To con&s;ider, what benefit the <HI>Angels</HI> have by what is done in the affair of our redemption. So hath the wi&s;dom of God contriv'd this affair, that the benefit of what he has done therein &s;hould be &s;o exten&s;ive, as to reach the elect angels. It is for men that the work of redemption is wrought out; and yet the benefit of the things done in this work is not confined to them, or all that is properly called redemption, or included in it is confined to men. The angels can't partake in this, for they have no need of any redemption, having ne|ver fallen. Neither have they that direct benefit, by what is done in this work, that man has: yet they have great indirect benefit by it.</P>
<P>GOD hath &s;o wi&s;ely ordered, that what has been done directly and e&s;pecially for men, in this, &s;hould re|dound to the exceeding benefit of all intelligent crea|tures, that are in favour with God. That the benefit of it &s;hould be &s;o diffu&s;ive as not to be confined to earth, but reach heaven it&s;elf. So great and manifold is the good attain'd in this work, that tho&s;e glorious &s;pirits that are &s;o much above us, and were &s;o highly exalted in happine&s;s before, yet &s;hould receive great addition hereby.</P>
<P>I will &s;hew <HI>how</HI> in &s;ome particulars.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="199" REF="009961_0312_0F7B3CB786406720">1. The angels hereby &s;ee a great and wonderful ma|nife&s;tation of the glory of God The happine&s;s of an|gels as well as of men, con&s;i&s;ts very much in beho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ding the glory of God. The excellency of the divine Being is a mo&s;t de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight ful &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bject of contemplation to the &s;aints on earth; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch more to the angels in heaven. The more holy any being is, the more &s;wee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and de|light ful wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l it be to him to behold the glory and beauty of the &s;upreme Being.</P>
<P>Therefore the beholding the glory of God mu&s;t be exceeding ravi&s;hing to the holy angels, that are perfect in ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine&s;s, and never had their minds leaven'd with &s;in. The manife&s;tations of the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ory of God, are as it were the food that &s;atisfies the ange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s: they live thereon. It is their greate&s;t happine&s;s.</P>
<P>And it is exceeding delightful to them to behold the glory of God manife&s;ted in his works. It is without doubt much of their employment to behold the glory of God appearing in his works. Therefore this work of redemption greatly contributes to their happine&s;s and delight, as the glory of God is &s;o exceedingly manife&s;ted by it. For what is done, is done in the &s;ight of the an|gels, as is evident by our text and many other pa&s;&s;ages of holy &s;cripture. And they behold the glory of God appearing hearin with entertainment and delight; as it is manife&s;t by 1 Pet. 1.12. <HI>Which things the angels de&s;ire to look into.</HI></P>
<P>The angels have this advantage that now they may behold the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, where it &s;hines with a peculiar lu&s;tre and brightne&s;s. This is &s;poken of, 1 Tim. 3.5. <HI>Great is the my&s;tery of godline&s;s, God was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, ju&s;tified in the &s;pirit, &s;een of Angels.</HI> Perhaps all God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s attri|butes are more gloriou&s;ly manife&s;ted in this work, than in any other that ever the angels &s;aw. There is cer|tainly a fuller manife&s;tation of &s;ome of his attributes, than ever they &s;aw before; as is evident by
<PB N="200" REF="009961_0313_0F7B3CB845233750">
the text, as we have ob&s;erved already. And e&s;pecially, it is &s;o with re&s;pect to the mercy and grace of God, that &s;weet and endearing attribute of the di|vine nature The angels of heaven never &s;aw &s;o much grace manife&s;ted before, as in the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k of redemption; nor in any mea&s;ure equal to it. It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> exceeding ravi&s;h|ing to them to behold &s;uch a di&s;covery of this amiable perfection of God. How full of joy doth it fill the heart of the angels, to &s;ee &s;uch a boundle&s;s and bottom|le&s;s ocean of love and grace in the heart of God. And therefore with what rejoycing do all the angels prai&s;e Chri&s;t for this work of divine grace, his being &s;lain! Rev. 5.11, 12. <HI>And I beheld, and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the bea&s;ts and the elders: And the number of them was ten thou|&s;and times ten thou&s;and, and thou&s;ands of thou&s;ands; &s;aying with a loud voice, worth is the lamb that was &s;lain to receive power &amp; riches &amp; wi&s;dom, and &s;trength, and honor, and glory and ble&s;&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They have this benefit by it, that hereby Je&s;us Chri&s;t, God-man, is become their head. God, &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing in three per&s;ons, Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, was the king of angels, and would have been, if it had not been for our redemption. But it was owing to what is done in this work, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as God man, becomes th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> head of the angels. Chri&s;t is now not only the head of angels &s;imply as God, but as God man. Col. 2.10. <HI>And ye are compleat in him, who is the head of all principality &amp; power.</HI> Eph. 1.20, 21, 22 <HI>Which he wrought in Chri&s;t, when he rai&s;ed him from the dead, and &s;et him on his own right hand in heavenly places, far above all principa|lity and power, and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but al&s;o in that which is to come. And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="009961_0314_0F7B3CB9D0248D98">This is a part of the exaltation and glory of Chri&s;t, which God confers on him, as his reward. But not on|ly &s;o, but it is greatly to the angels benefit. It is God's manner in his dealings with his elect creatures, in the &s;ame works wherein he glorifies him&s;elf, or his Son, greatly to benefi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them. The &s;ame dealings of his that are mo&s;t for his glory, &s;hall be mo&s;t for their good.</P>
<P>That Chri&s;t God-man &s;hould be made the head of the angels, is greatly to their benefit,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, becau&s;e they become hereby more nearly re|lated to &s;o glorious a per&s;on. They have a more near relation and clo&s;e union with the Son of God, than o|therwi&s;e they would have. The angels e&s;teem it a great honor done them to be related to &s;uch a Per&s;on as Je&s;us Chri&s;t, God-man, who by rea&s;on that he is a di|vine Per&s;on is an infinitely honourable per&s;on.</P>
<P>The angels by Chri&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s becoming their head, are be|come nearly related to him. They with the &s;aints are gathered together in one in Chri&s;t, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.10. They by virtue hereof, tho' Chri&s;t be not their redeemer as he is our's, yet have a right and propriety in this glorious Per&s;on, as well as we. He is theirs: tho' not their Saviour, yet he is their head of government, and head of influence.</P>
<P>Secondly. Again this is greatly to their benefit; as they, as well as we, hereby are under advantages for a far more intimate conver&s;e with God. The divine na|ture is at an infinite di&s;tance from the nature of angels, as well as from the nature of man. This di&s;tance for|bids that familiarity and intimacy of intercour&s;e&mdash;.</P>
<P>It is therefore a great advantage to the angels, that God is come down to them in a created nature; and in that nature is become their head; &s;o that their inter|cour&s;e and enjoyment may be more intimate. They are invited by the &s;imilar qualifications of the created nature, that the Son of God is in.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="009961_0315_0F7B3CBACEE71428">Thirdly, It is for the benefit of the angels, as here|by the elect of mankind are gathered into this Society. Chri&s;t by the work of redemption, gathers in the elect of mankind to join the angels of heaven: Eph. 1.10. <HI>That in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times, he might gather together in one all things in Chri&s;t, both which are in heaven, &amp; which are on earth, even in him.</HI></P>
<P>Men are brought in to join with the angels; to join with them in their work of prai&s;ing God; to partake with them of their enjoyments. The angels greatly rejoyce at this. They rejoyce when but one per&s;on is gathered in, as Chri&s;t teaches us, Luk. 15.10. <HI>Like|wi&s;e I &s;ay unto you, there is joy in the pre&s;ence of the angels of God, over one &s;inner that repenteth.</HI> The hea|venly &s;ociety is made more compleat by this acce&s;&s;ion of the &s;aints to it. The &s;aints and angels will contribute to the happine&s;s of each other. The angels rejoyce that others are added to join them and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in prai&s;ing God.</P>
<P>The vacancy by the fall of angels is filled up &mdash;</P>
<P>Fourthly, It tends to make the angels the more to prize their happine&s;s, when they &s;ee how much it co&s;t to purcha&s;e the &s;ame happine&s;s for man. The angels tho' they knew &s;o much, yet be not incapable of be|ing taught more and more of the worth of their own happine&s;s. For the worth of it is infinite, and there|fore the under&s;tanding of an angel cannot comprehend it. But when they &s;aw how much it co&s;t to purcha&s;e the &s;ame happine&s;s for man; that it co&s;t the precious blood of the Son of God. This tended to give them a great &s;en&s;e of the infinite value of their happine&s;s. They never &s;aw &s;uch a te&s;timony of the value of the eternal enjoyment of God before.</P>
<P>Thus we have &s;hewn, how the wi&s;dom of God ap|pears in the work of redemption in the good ends attain|ed thereby, with re&s;pect to God, men and angels.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="009961_0316_0F7B3CBB6204FFE8">We come now</P>
<P N="4">IV. To &s;hew what good ends are obtain'd with re|&s;pect to the devil, God's grand enemy, in his overthrow and the ruin of his kingdom. Satan and his angels re|belled again&s;t God in heaven. He proudly pre&s;umed to try his &s;trength with God's. He oppo&s;ed &s;trength. And when God by his almighty power over came the &s;trength of &s;atan, and &s;ent him like light'ning from hea|ven to hell with all his army; &s;atan does not give out: but tho' he was conquer'd when he oppo&s;ed his &s;trength to God's, yet he hoped to get the victory by &s;ubtilty. Tho' he could not overcome God by power, yet he hoped to &s;ucceed by craft: tho' he found that God's power could ea&s;ily ca&s;t them headlong from heaven to the bottomle&s;s pit; yet this proud &s;pirit did not de&s;pair of out-witting God; and &s;o his &s;ubtilty, di&s;appointing him of his end in creating this lower world.</P>
<P>GOD therefore has &s;hewn his great wi&s;dom in over|throwing &s;atan's de&s;ign. He has di&s;appointed the devi&s;es of the crafty, &s;o that they cannot perform their enter|prize. He has carried &s;atan's coun&s;el headlong.</P>
<P N="1">1. Satan thought to have di&s;appointed God of his own glory, that he de&s;igned in creating this lower world: And to make mankind, which God had made for his own glory, not to be for God's, but for his own glory, in &s;etting up him&s;elf God over them.</P>
<P>Now Chri&s;t, by what he has done, in the work of redemption, has ovorthrown, &s;atan, has utterly fru&s;|trated him, as to this end of his, viz. robbing God of his glory. God is not robbed of his glory; but is exceedingly glorified in mankind &mdash; in the elect to the &s;urprize of angels and devils. God by redemp|tion has all the glory of mankind that he intended, and more than ever, either men, angels or devils thought of, or imagined that God intended.</P>
<P>Satan did not know any way how God could have his intended glory by mankind, after he had procured
<PB N="204" REF="009961_0317_0F7B3CBBFAE82F58">
their fall. But God knew a way that the devil never thought of. Neither could the wi&s;e&s;t angel in heaven have thought o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it.</P>
<P>GOD might have glorified his ju&s;tice in the de&s;truction of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l mankind. But it was God's de&s;ign in creating the world to glorify his goodne&s;s &amp; love; and not only to be glorified eventually, but to be &s;erved and glorified actually by mankind. Satan intended to fru&s;trate God of this end; but his de&s;ign is confounded by the re|demption of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another de&s;ign of the devil, was to gratify his envy, in the utter de&s;truction of mankind. But by the redemption of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, this malicious de&s;ign of &s;atan's is cro&s;t: becau&s;e all the elect, whom God de&s;ign'd &s;hould be happy when he made the world, are brought to their de&s;igned happine&s;s; which is much greater than ever &s;atan thought it was in God's heart to be&s;tow on man.</P>
<P>And tho' &s;ome of mankind are left to be mi&s;erable yet that does not an&s;wer &s;atan's end; for this is ordered for God's glory. No more are left mi&s;erable than God &s;aw meet to glorify his ju&s;tice upon.</P>
<P>One end why God &s;uffered &s;atan to do what he did in procuring the fall of man, was that his Son might be glorified in conquering that &s;trong, &s;ubtil and proud &s;pirit, and triumphing over him.</P>
<P>How glorious doth Chri&s;t Je&s;us appear in baffling and triumphing over this proud king of darkne&s;s, and all the haughty confederate rulers of hell.</P>
<P>How glorious a &s;ight is it to &s;ee the meek and pa|tient Lamb of God, leading that proud, malicious and mighty enemy in triumph! What &s;ongs doth this cau&s;e in heaven!</P>
<P>It was a glorious &s;ight in I&s;rael to &s;ee <HI>David</HI> carry|ing the head of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oliah in triumph to Jeru&s;alem. It appeared a glorious &s;ight to the daughters of I&s;rael, who came out with timbrels and with dances, and &s;ang,
<PB N="205" REF="009961_0318_0F7B3CBD942FFBE8">
"<HI>Saul</HI> hath &s;lain his thou&s;ands, and <HI>David</HI> his ten thou&s;ands." But how much more glorious to &s;ee the Son of <HI>David</HI> and the Son of God, carrying the head of the &s;piritual Goliah, the champion of the armies of hell, in triumph to the heavenly Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>This victory of Chri&s;t is much celebrated. It is with a principal view to this, that Chri&s;t is called, "The Lord of Ho&s;ts or Armies, and a Man of War&punc; <HI>Exod.</HI> 15.3. And <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 24 8. "Who is this King of Glory! The Lord &s;trong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battle."</P>
<P>Thus we have briefly &s;hewn, how the wi&s;dom of God appears, in the contrivance of our &s;alvation, by the great|ne&s;s and manifoldne&s;s, of the good ends that are ob|tain'd. We proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI> To &s;hew how the wi&s;dom of God appears in the wonderful manner and circum&s;tances, of the at|tainment of this good. And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. I would ob&s;erve &s;ome things under this head, with re&s;pect to the glory of God that is obtained thereby.</P>
<P N="1">1. By this contrivance for our redemption, God's greate&s;t di&s;honour is made an occa&s;ion of his greate&s;t glory. Sin is a thing by which God is greatly di&s;ho|noured; the nature of it's principle is enmity again&s;t God, and contempt of him. And man by his rebellion has greatly di&s;honoured God. But this di&s;honour by the contrivance for our redemption, is made an occa&s;ion of the greate&s;t manife&s;tation of God's glory that ever was. Sin, the greate&s;t evil, is made an occa&s;ion of the greate&s;t good</P>
<P>It is made an occa&s;ion of a greater glory, than before was, or than otherwi&s;e would have been. It is the na|ture of a principle of &s;in that it &s;eeks to dethrone God; but this is hereby made an occa&s;ion of the greate&s;t ma|nife&s;tation of God's royal maje&s;ty and glory that ever was. By &s;in, man has &s;lighted and di&s;pi&s;ed God. But this is made an occa&s;ion of his appearing the more great|ly honourable. Sin ca&s;ts contempt upon the authority
<PB N="206" REF="009961_0319_0F7B3CBE48604598">
and law of God. But this is, by the contrivance for our redemption, made the occa&s;ion of the greate&s;t honor done to that &s;ame authority, and that very law, that ever was. It was a greater honor to the law of God that Chri&s;t was &s;ubject to it, and obey'd it, than if all mankind had obey'd it. It was a greater honor to God's authority that Chri&s;t &s;hew'd &s;uch great re&s;pect, and &s;uch intire &s;ubjection to it, than the perfect obedience of all the angels in heaven.</P>
<P>Man by his &s;in &s;hew'd his enmity again&s;t the holine&s;s of God: but this is made an occa&s;ion of the greate&s;t manife&s;tation of God's holine&s;s. The holine&s;s of God never appeared to the degree it did when God executed vengeance upon his own dear Son.</P>
<P N="2">2. So has the wi&s;dom of God contrived that tho&s;e attributes are glorified in man's &s;alvation; who&s;e glory &s;eemed to require his de&s;truction. When man had fall|en, &s;everal attributes of God &s;eemed to require his de|&s;truction. The ju&s;tice of God &s;eemed to require it; for the ju&s;tice of God requires that &s;in be puni&s;hed as it de&s;erves: But it de&s;erves no le&s;s than eternal de&s;tructi|on. God proclaims it as a part of the glory of his na|ture, that he will in no wi&s;e clear the guilty, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34.7.</P>
<P>And &s;o again the holine&s;s of God &s;eemed to require man's de&s;truction; for God by his holine&s;s infinitely hates &s;in. This &s;eemed to require therefore that God &s;hould manife&s;t a proportionable hatred of the &s;inner; and that he &s;hould be for ever an enemy unto him.</P>
<P>And the truth of God &s;eemed al&s;o to require man's de&s;truction; for eternal death was what God had threat|ned for &s;in, one jot or tittle of which word cannot by any means pa&s;s away.</P>
<P>But yet &s;o has God contrived that tho&s;e very attri|butes not only do allow of man's redemption, and are not oppo&s;ite unto it; their glory is not only not incon|&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="207" REF="009961_0320_0F7B3CBF0BE97040">
with it, but they are glorified in it. That &s;ame vindictive ju&s;tice is glorified in this way of &s;alvation. It is manife&s;t in the death and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t: So that &s;ame holine&s;s of God and hatred of &s;in, that &s;eemed to require man's damnation, is &s;een in Chri&s;t's dying for &s;inners.&mdash;</P>
<P>So here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> al&s;o is manife&s;ted and glorified the truth of God, in the threatenings of the Law. &mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3. Yea, it is &s;o ordered now that the glory of the&s;e attributes requires the &s;alvation of tho&s;e that believe. The ju&s;tice of God that required man's damnation, and &s;eemed incon&s;i&s;tent with his &s;alvation, now does as much require the &s;alvation of tho&s;e that believe in Chri&s;t, as ever before it required their damnation. Salvation is an ab&s;olute debt to the believer from God, &s;o that he may in ju&s;tice demand and challenge it; not upon the ac|count of what he him&s;elf has done; but upon the ac|count of what his Surety has done. For Chri&s;t has &s;atisfied ju&s;tice fully for his &s;in; &s;o that it is but a thing that may be challenged that God &s;hould now relea&s;e the believer from the puni&s;hment; it is but a piece of ju&s;tice, that the creditor &s;hould relea&s;e the debtor, when he has fully paid the debt. And again, the believer may demand eternal life, becau&s;e it has been merited by Chri&s;t, by a merit of condignity. So it is contrived that that ju&s;tice that &s;eemed to require man's de&s;truction, now requires his &s;alvation.</P>
<P>So it is with the truth of God. The truth of God that &s;eemed to require man's damnation, now requires man's &s;alvation. At the &s;ame time that the threat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ning of the law &s;tands good, there is a promi&s;e of eternal life to many of them that have broken the law. They both &s;tand good at the &s;ame time: and the truth of God requires that both &s;hould be fulfill'd. And how much &s;oever they &s;eemed to interfere one with another, yet &s;o is the matter contrived in this way of &s;alvation, that both are fulfill'd and do not interfere one with another.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="009961_0321_0F7B3CC0181F2008">At the very &s;ame time that God uttered that threat|ning, "In the day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die:" and at the &s;ame time that <HI>Adam</HI> had fir&s;t eaten the forbidden fruit; there was then a promi&s;e &s;tood good, that many thou&s;ands of <HI>Adam's</HI> race &s;hould obtain eternal life; for this promi&s;e was made before the world was to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. What a difficulty and an incon|&s;i&s;tence did here &s;eem to be? But it was no diffiulty to the wi&s;dom of God, which had &s;o contrived that there &s;hould appear no incon&s;i&s;tence; but that that promi&s;e, and that threatening &s;hould be both fully accompli&s;hed to the glory of God's truth in each of them P&s;al 85.10. <HI>Mercy and truth are met together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Tho&s;e very attributes which &s;eemed to require man's de&s;truction, are more glorious in his &s;alvation, than they would have been in his de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The revenging ju&s;tice of God is a great deal more manife&s;ted in the death of Chri&s;t, than it would have been if all mankind had been damned to all eternity; and that becau&s;e, if man had remained under the guilt and imputation of &s;in, the ju&s;tice of God would not have had &s;uch a trial, as it had, when his own Son was under the imputation of &s;in. If all mankind had &s;tood guilty, and ju&s;tice had called for vengeance upon them, &mdash; that would have been, in no wi&s;e, &s;uch a trial of the inflexi|blene&s;s and unchangeablene&s;s of the ju&s;tice of God, as when his own Son, that was the object of his infinite love, and in whom he infinitely delighted, &s;tood with the imputation of guilt upon him.</P>
<P>This was the greate&s;t trial that could be, whether or no God's ju&s;tice was perfect and unchangeable, or not. This was the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible trial whether or no God was &s;o ju&s;t that he would not upon any account, abate of what ju&s;tice required. This was the greate&s;t trial that can be conceived of, whether or no God would have any re&s;pect to per&s;ons, in judgment. And God when
<PB N="209" REF="009961_0322_0F7B3CC07B4D5DB0">
there was &s;uch a trial, hath appear'd immutably ju&s;t. He excted aall, even the utmo&s;t farthing of the debt due to ju&s;tice, of his Son.</P>
<P>So the maje&s;ty of God appears much more in the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n it would have done in the eter|nal &s;ufferings of all mankind, &mdash; that his ju&s;tice &s;hould be executed upon &s;o great a per&s;on, a per&s;on of infinite dignity. It exceedingly &s;hews the awful maje&s;ty of God; as the maje&s;ty of a prince appears greater in the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of great per&s;onages that are under the guilt of trea&s;on, than le&s;&s;er per&s;ons.</P>
<P>And then the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t have this advantage of the eternal &s;ufferings of the wicked, for impre&s;&s;ing upon the minds of the &s;pectators a &s;en&s;e of the dread maje&s;ty and infinite ju&s;tice of God, and his infinite ha|tred of &s;in; viz. that the eternal &s;ufferings of the wick|ed never will be &s;een actually accompli&s;hed and fini&s;hed; whereas they have &s;een that which is equivalent to tho&s;e eternal &s;ufferings actually fulfilled and fini&s;hed in the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">5. Such is the wi&s;dom of this way of &s;alvation, that the more any of the elect have di&s;honoured God, the more is God glorified in this redemption. Such won|ders as the&s;e are accompli&s;hed by the wi&s;dom of this way of &s;alvation. Such things as the&s;e, if they had been propo&s;ed to any creature intelligence, would have &s;eemed &s;trange and unaccountable paradoxes, till the coun&s;els of divine wi&s;dom concerning the matter were unfolded.</P>
<P>So &s;ufficient is this way of &s;alvation, that it is not incon&s;i&s;tent with any of God's attributes to &s;ave the chief of &s;inners. However great a &s;inner any one has been, yet God can, if he plea&s;es, &s;ave without any injury to the glory of any one attribute. And not only &s;o, but the more &s;inful any one has been, the more doth God glorify him&s;elf in his &s;alvation. The more doth he glorify his power, that he can redeem one in whom
<PB N="210" REF="009961_0323_0F7B3CC1CAA186F0">
&s;in &s;o abounds, and of whom &s;atan has &s;uch &s;trong po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. The greater triumph has Chri&s;t over his grand adver&s;ary, in redeeming and &s;etting at liberty from his bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">age tho&s;e that were his greate&s;t va&s;&s;als. The more doth the &s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t appear, in that it is &s;uffi|cient for &s;uch vile wretches.</P>
<P>The more is the &s;overeignty, and boundle&s;s extent of the mercy of God manife&s;ted, in that it is &s;ufficient to redeem tho&s;e that are mo&s;t unde&s;erving. Rom. 5.20. <HI>Where &s;in abounded, grace did much more abound.</HI></P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. So hath God contrived in this way, that a &s;inful creature, &s;hould become not guilty; and he that has no righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own, &s;hould become righteous. The&s;e things if they had been propo&s;ed, wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d have appeared contradictions to any but only the divine un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P>If it had been propo&s;ed to any creature, to find out a way that a &s;inful creature &s;hould not be a guilty crea|ture,
<PB N="211" REF="009961_0324_0F7B3CC21C73B4E8">
how impo&s;&s;ible would it have been judged, that there &s;hould be any way at all. It would doubtle&s;s have been judged impo&s;&s;ible but that he that has com|mitted &s;in, mu&s;t &s;tand guilty of the &s;in he has committed. And if &s;in be &s;uch a thing as nece&s;&s;arily obliges to pu|ni&s;hment, then&punc; that it mu&s;t ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ige to puni&s;hment him that has committed it. If puni&s;hment and &s;in be in&s;e|perable, then that puni&s;hment and the &s;inner are in&s;e|perable. If the law denounces death to the per&s;on that is guilty of &s;in, and it be impo&s;&s;ible, that the law &s;hould not take place, then that he that has committed &s;in mu&s;t die Thus any created under&s;tanding would have thought.</P>
<P>And &s;o if it had been propo&s;ed that there &s;hould be &s;ome way found out wherein man might be righteous, with|out fulfilling righteou&s;ne&s;s him&s;elf; &s;o that he might rea&s;onably and properly be looked upon and accepted as a righteous per&s;on, and adjudged to the reward of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and yet have no righteou&s;ne&s;s at all of his own; and nothing but the contrary.

<P>But yet the wi&s;dom of God has truly accompli&s;hed each of the&s;e things. He hath accompli&s;hed, that tho' men are &s;inners, yet they &s;hould be without guilt, in that he hath found out a way th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the threatnings of the law &s;hould truly and properly be fulfilled, and puni&s;h|ment be executed on &s;in, and yet not on the &s;inner.

And the Law is fulfilled &amp; an&s;wered by the obedience of Chri&s;t, &s;o that his righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould properly be our righteou&s;ne&s;s. Tho' not performed by us, yet it is properly and rea&s;onably accepted for us, as much as

And that becau&s;e Je&s;us Chri&s;t has &s;o united him&s;elf to us, and us to him, as to make him&s;elf our's,&mdash;to make him&s;elf our head. He has united him&s;elf to the elect by his dying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ove. The love of Chri&s;t to the elect is &s;o great, that God the Father looks upon it proper and &s;uitable to account Chri&s;t and the elect as one; and ac|cordingly to account what Chri&s;t does and &s;uffers, as if they <HI>did</HI> and <HI>&s;uffered</HI> it.</P>
<P>That love of Chri&s;t that is &s;o great as to render Chri&s;t willing to put him&s;elf in the &s;tead of the elect, and to bear the mi&s;ery that they de&s;erved, does in the Father's ac|count &s;o unite Chri&s;t and the elect, that they may be look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d upon as legally one.</P>
<P N="2">2. It &s;hews wonderful wi&s;dom that our good &s;hould be procured by &s;uch &s;eemingly unlikely and oppo&s;ite means, as the humiliation of the Son of God.

<P>But w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en Chri&s;t was about to perform the great work of redeeming a lo&s;t world, the wi&s;dom of God took an oppo&s;ite method, and determin'd that Chri&s;t in order to the &s;ucce&s;sfully performing of it, &s;hould be humbled and aba&s;ed to a mean &s;tate, that he &s;hould appear in low circum&s;tances.

<P>Creature-wi&s;dom would have thought that Chri&s;t, in order to perform this great work, &s;hould deck him&s;elf with all his &s;trength, and if po&s;&s;ible be made more &s;trong. But divine wi&s;dom determin'd, that Chri&s;t, in order to perform it, &s;hould be made weak, that he &s;hould put on the infirmities of human nature. The wi&s;dom of God &s;aw this infirmity and weakne&s;s needful in order to the working out our &s;alvation.</P>
<P>And why did divine wi&s;dom determine that he &s;hould become thus weak? It was that he might be &s;ubject to want, and to &s;uffering, and to the power and malice of his enemies. But then what advantage could it be of to him in this work, to be &s;ubject to the power and malice of his enemies! It was the very de&s;ign that he came into the world upon, to overcome his enemies, to over|throw them. Who would have thought that this was the way to overthrow them, to become weak &amp; feeble, &amp; for that very end that he might be &s;ubject to their power and malice. But this is the very means that the wi&s;dom of God pitched upon, whereby Chri&s;t was to overthrow his enemies, viz. his being weak, and &s;o being for a time &s;ubject to their power and malice.</P>
<P>This was the means by which God determined that Chri&s;t &s;hould prevail again&s;t his enemies, that he &s;hould be &s;o &s;ubject to their power, that they might prevail a|gain&s;t him, &s;o as to put him to great di&s;grace and to great pain, and even &s;o as to kill him.</P>
<P>What other wi&s;dom but divine wi&s;dom could ever have determined&mdash;that this was the way to be taken in order to the being &s;ucce&s;sful in the work of our redemp|tion. This would have appear'd to creature-wi&s;dom

<P>Our fir&s;t parents, if they had &s;tood and per&s;ever'd in perfect obedience, 'till God had given them the fruit of the tree of life as a &s;eal of their reward, they would have been advanced to higher happine&s;s; for they before were but in a &s;tate of probation for their reward. And 'tis not to be &s;uppo&s;ed but that their happine&s;s was to have been greater after they had per|&s;i&s;ted in obedience, and had actua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly received the reward, than it was, while they were in a &s;tate of trial for it.
<PB N="216" REF="009961_0329_0F7B3CC686B4FAE0">
But by the redemption of Chri&s;t, the &s;in and mi&s;ery of the elect is made an occa&s;ion of their being brought to a higher happine&s;s than mankind would have had if they had per&s;i&s;ted in obedience 'till they had received the reward. As is manife&s;t in the following things.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Man is hereby brought to a greater and nearer union with God. If man had never fallen, God would have remained man's friend; he would have enjoyed God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;avor, and &s;o would have been the object of Chri&s;t, as he would have had the favor of all the per|&s;ons of the trinity.</P>
<P>But now Chri&s;t becoming our &s;urety and Saviour, and having taken on him our nature, occa&s;ions between Chri&s;t and us an union of a quite different kind, and a nearer re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation than otherwi&s;e would have been. Chri&s;t is become our's now, in a manner than otherwi&s;e would not have been. The fall is the occa&s;ion of Chri&s;t's becoming our head, and the church his body. And believers are become his brethren and kinsfolk, and &s;pou&s;e, in a manner that otherwi&s;e would not have been. And by our union with Chri&s;t we have a greater union with God the Father. We, if we had &s;tood, &s;hould have been the children of God in a &s;en&s;e as the angels are &s;aid to be the &s;ons of God, <HI>Job</HI> 38.7.</P>
<P>But now we are &s;ons in a different, more excellent manner, that is by a &s;pecial relation to Chri&s;t the eter|nal Son of God, and a certain participation of his rela|tion to the Father. We are &s;ons by vertue of our u|nion with the natural &s;on of God. Gal. 4.4, 5, 6. <HI>When the fulne&s;s of time was come, God &s;ent forth his &s;on, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of &s;ons. And becau&s;e ye are &s;ons, God hath &s;ent forth the &s;pirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, abba, father.</HI> And therefore Chri&s;t has taught us, in all our addre&s;&s;es to God, to call him Our Father, in like manner as he calls him Father, Joh. 20.17. <HI>Go tell my
<PB N="217" REF="009961_0330_0F7B3CC741E42568">
brethren, behold I a&s;cend to my Father, and your Fa|ther.</HI></P>
<P>This is one of the wonderful things brought about by the work of redemption. That thereby our &s;epara|tion from God, is made an occa&s;ion of a greater union, than was before, or otherwi&s;e would have been.</P>
<P>When we fell, there was a dreadfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eparation made betwixt God and us, but this is made an occa&s;ion of a greater union. Joh. 17.20, 21 22, 23. <HI>Neither pray I for the&s;e alone, but for them al&s;o which &s;hall believe on me thro' their word: that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee: that they al&s;o may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me. And the glory which thou gave&s;t me I have given them: that they may be one even as we are one, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. Man now has greater manife&s;tations of the glory and love of God, than otherwi&s;e he would have had. Man's happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts principally in the mani|fe&s;tations of the&s;e two things, viz. of the glory &mdash; and love of God. Now, man by the work of redemption, has greater manife&s;tation of both of them, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">her|wi&s;e he would have had. We have already &s;poken particularly of the glory of God, and what advan|tages even the Angels have by the di&s;coveries of it in this work. But if they have &s;uch advantages, much more, will man who is far more directly concerned in this affair than they.</P>
<P>And here is in this work, immen&s;ely greater di&s;plays of the love of God, than man had before he fell; or, as we may well &s;uppo&s;e, than he would have had, if he had never fallen. God now manife&s;ts his love to his people, by &s;ending his Son into the world, to die for them. There never would have been any &s;uch te&s;ti|mony of the love of God, if man had not fallen.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="009961_0331_0F7B3CC804573C90">CHRIST manife&s;ts his love, by coming into the world, and laying down his life. This is the greate&s;t te&s;timony of divine love that can be conceived, immen&s;ely gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ater than all ble&s;&s;ings would have been, if be&s;towed upon man in innocency, and without any humiliation, or &s;uffer|ing of any of the divine per&s;ons. This is a greater te&s;timony of divine love than otherwi&s;e would have been thought of, or known to be po&s;&s;ible. Now &s;urely the greater di&s;coveries God's people have of God's love to them, the more happy mu&s;t they be: the more they &s;ee of God's love to them, the more occa&s;ion will they have to rejoyce in that love. Here will be a de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight|ful theme the &s;aints will have to contemplate to all eternity, which they never could have had, if man never had fallen, viz the dying love of Chri&s;t. They will have occa&s;ion now to &s;ing that &s;ong for ever, in the fir&s;t chapter of Revelations, ver. 5, 6. <HI>Unto him that loved us, and wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prie&s;ts unto God and his fa|ther, to whom be glory and dominion forever, amen.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. Man now has greater motives offered him to love God than otherwi&s;e he ever would have had. Man's happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in mutual love between God and man;&mdash;in &s;eeing God's love to him and in recipro|cally loving God. And the more he &s;ees of Gods love to him, and the more he loves God, the more happy mu&s;t he be. His love to God is as nece&s;&s;ary in order to his happine&s;s, as the &s;eeing God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s love to him; for he can have no joy in the beholding God's love to him, any otherwi&s;e than as he loves God.</P>
<P>This makes the &s;aints prize God's love to them, be|cau&s;e they love him. If they did not love God, it wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d not rejoyce them to make them happy, to &s;ee his love to them; becau&s;e they would make light of his love and de&s;pi&s;e it. The more any per&s;on loves another, the more will he be delighted in the manife&s;tations of that other's love.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="009961_0332_0F7B3CC8C474B770">There is provi&s;ion therefore made for both in the work of redemption. Both, that there &s;hould be greater manife&s;tations of the love of God to us, than there would have been, if man had not fallen, and al&s;o that man &s;hould love God more than he would have done, if he had not fallen. And that therefore there are greater motives to love him than otherwi&s;e there would have been. There are greater obligations to love him, for God has done more for us to win our love. Chri&s;t hath died for us. Man would have had no &s;uch motives to the love of God, if man had not fallen: none to be compared to it. The greater motives God's people have to love God, the more will their hearts indeed be drawn forth to love, and con&s;equently the more happy will men be.</P>
<P>And then, man is now brought to a more univer&s;al and immediate and &s;en&s;ible dependance on God, than otherwi&s;e he would have been. All his happine&s;s is now <HI>of</HI> him, <HI>thro'</HI> him, and <HI>in</HI> him. If man had not fallen, he would have all his happine&s;s of God, but he would have had it by his own righteou&s;ne&s;s; but now it is by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. He would have had all his holine&s;s of God, but not &s;o &s;en&s;ibly; becau&s;e then he would have been holy from the beginning, as &s;oon as he received his being; there never would have been a time when he was not holy, and &s;o it's deriva|tion from God would not have been &s;o &s;en&s;ible as it is now, when he is fir&s;t &s;inful and univer&s;ally corrupt, and afterwards is made holy. If man had held his inte|grity and per&s;ever'd in obedience through the time of trial, he would have had all his happine&s;s from God, but not &s;o &s;en&s;ibly; for he would have been happy from the time when he fir&s;t began to exi&s;t in a con|&s;tant uninterrupted manner, and mi&s;ery would have been a &s;tranger to him; and therefore happine&s;s would not have been &s;o &s;en&s;ible a derivation from God, as it is now, when man looks to God from the deeps of
<PB N="220" REF="009961_0333_0F7B3CC99DDA6138">
di&s;tre&s;s, cries repeatedly to him, and waits upon him, being convinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by abundant experience, that he has no where el&s;e to go but to God, who is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed in con&s;equence of man's earne&s;t and per&s;evering &s;uit to appear to his relief, take him out of the miry clay and horrible pit, and &s;et him upon a rock, and e&s;tabli&s;h his goings, and put a new &s;ong into his mouth.</P>
<P>By man's having thus a more immediate, and univer|&s;al and &s;en&s;ible dependence, God doth more intirely &s;e|cure man's undivided re&s;pect. There is greater motive for man to make God his all in all, &mdash;to love him and rejoyce in him as his only portion.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. By the contrivance for our &s;alvation, man's &s;in and mi&s;ery are but an occa&s;ion of his being brought to a more full and free conver&s;e with, and enjoyment of God than otherwi&s;e would have been. For as we have ob|&s;erved already, the union is greater; and the greater the union, the more full the communion, and intimate the intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>And then, man has this advantage, that Chri&s;t is come down to him, in his own nature; and hereby he may conver&s;e with Chri&s;t more intimately, than the infinite di&s;tance of the divine nature would allow. I have be|fore ob&s;erved this advantage as what the angels have, but 'tis more man's advantage than the angels. For Chri&s;t is not only in a created nature, but he <HI>is in man's own nature.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;o we have advantages for a more full enjoyment of God. This end is al&s;o obtain'd in the work of re|demption, viz. that by Chri&s;t's incarnation, the &s;aints may &s;ee God with their bodily eyes&punc; as well as by an intellectual view. They may &s;ee him in both ways of &s;eeing, which their natures, being body and &s;pirit, are capable of. The &s;aints after the day of judgment, will con&s;i&s;t of both body and &s;oul: And &s;o they will have outward as well as &s;piritual &s;ight. It is now ordered of divine wi&s;dom, that God him&s;elf or a divine per&s;on
<PB N="221" REF="009961_0334_0F7B3CCA3A459E28">
&s;hould be the principal entertainment of both the&s;e kinds of &s;ight, &s;piritual and corporal. And that the &s;aints in heaven &s;hould not only have an intellectual &s;ight of God, but that they &s;hould &s;ee a divine per&s;on as they &s;ee one ano|ther: which &s;hall not only be &s;piritua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, but outwardly.</P>
<P>The body of Je&s;us Chri&s;t will therefore appear with that tran&s;cendent vi&s;ible maje&s;ty and beauty, that is ex|ceeding expre&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the divine maje&s;ty beauty &amp; glory. The body of Chri&s;t &s;hall appear with the glory of God upon it, as Chri&s;t tel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s us that he will come at the day of judgment, with the glory of his Father, Mat. 16.27. <HI>The Son of man &s;hall come in the glory of his Father.</HI> This will be a great happine&s;s to the &s;aints thus to &s;ee God. Job comforted him&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f with this, that he &s;hould &s;ee God with his bodily eyes, Job 19.26 <HI>And tho' after my skin, worms de&s;troy this body, yet in my fle&s;h &s;hall I &s;ee God.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5ly. and la&s;tly. Man's &s;in and mi&s;ery is made an oc|ca&s;ion of his greater happine&s;s, as he has now a greater reli&s;h of happine&s;s, by rea&s;on of his knowledge of both. In order to happine&s;s, there mu&s;t be two things, viz. his union to a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oper object&mdash;and a reli&s;h of the object. Man's &s;in and mi&s;ery is made an occa&s;ion of increa&s;ing both the&s;e, by the work of redemption. We have &s;hewn already that the union is increa&s;ed. And that is not only increa&s;ed but the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h too; and that by the knowledge that man now has of evil. The&s;e contra|ries, good and evil, heighten the &s;en&s;e of one another. And therefore the forbidden tree was called the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 'Tis the tree of the knowledge of evil; becau&s;e it was by that that we came to the experience of evil. If it had not been for our eating of that tree, we never &s;hould have known what evil was. And it is al&s;o the tree of the knowledge of Good, becau&s;e we &s;hould ne|ver have known &s;o we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l what good was, if it had not been for that tree. We are taught the value of good,
<PB N="222" REF="009961_0335_0F7B3CCD47D2D2A8">
by our knowledge of it's contrary, evil. This teaches us to prize good, and makes us the more to reli&s;h it and rejoyce in it.</P>
<P>This is made to be the effect of the fruit of that tree to the &s;aints by the work of redemption. They there|by know &s;omething what a &s;tate of &s;in and alienation from God is. They know &s;omething what the anger of God is, and what it is to be in danger of hell. And this makes them the more exceedingly to rejoyce in the favour of God, and in the enjoyment of God.</P>
<P>Take two per&s;ons: one that never knew what evil was, never was in any mi&s;ery; but that was happy from the fir&s;t moment of his being, having the favour of God, and all manner of tokens of it. And another that is in a very doleful, lo&s;t and undone condition: and let there be be&s;tow'd upon the&s;e two per&s;ons the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ings, the &s;ame good things: and let them be objectively in the &s;ame glorious circum&s;tances, &mdash; and which will re|joyce mo&s;t? Doubtle&s;s he that was brought to this happine&s;s out of a mi&s;erable and doleful &s;tate. So the &s;aints in heaven will for ever the more rejoyce in God, and in the enjoyment of his love, for their being brought to it out of a mo&s;t lamentable &s;tate &amp; condition. They thereby know what evil is, and great danger of it.</P>
<P>Other things might be mentioned, where the happi|ne&s;s that the &s;aints have by the redemption of Chri&s;t does excell the happine&s;s that man had before the fall; or that he would have had, if he had &s;tood. But the&s;e may &s;uffice.</P>

<P>But what &s;atan did in tempting man to fall is made an occa&s;ion of the contrary to what he intended, in that it gave occa&s;ion for God to glorify him&s;elf the more: and as al&s;o it giveth occa&s;ion for the elect's being bro't to higher happine&s;s: as we have &s;hewn.</P>
<P>The happy &s;tate that man was in was envied by &s;a|tan,&mdash;That man that was of earthly original &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d be advanc'd to &s;uch honors; when he who was orgi|nally of a &s;o much more noble nature &s;hould be ca&s;t down to &s;uch di&s;grace. His pride could not bear it,&mdash; that man that dwelt in a hou&s;e of clay, &s;hould be made &s;o much of, while he was in &s;uch mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>And how, may we conclude, that &s;atan triumphed when he had brought him down!</P>
<P>The devil tempted our fir&s;t parents with this, that if they eat of the forbidden fruit, they &s;hould be as Gods: it was a lie in &s;atan's mouth; for he aim'd at nothing el&s;e but to fool man out of his happine&s;s, and make him his own &s;lave and va&s;&s;al, with a blinded expectation of being like a god.</P>
<P>But little did &s;atan think that God would turn it &s;o, as to make man's fall an occa&s;ion of one in the human nature actually being a divine per&s;on. Man's eating the forbidden fruit is made an occa&s;ion of God's becoming man: and &s;o an occa&s;ion of our nature's being advanc'd to a union to God, &s;o as to be the &s;ame per&s;on.</P>
<P>By this means it comes to pa&s;s, that one in mans' nature, that &s;atan &s;o envyed, now &s;its at the right hand
<PB N="227" REF="009961_0340_0F7B3CD126C86010">
of God, inve&s;ted with divine power and glory,and reigns over heaven and earth with a god-like power and domi|nion. Thus is &s;atan di&s;appointed in his &s;ubtilty. As he intended, that &s;aying, "Ye &s;hall be as gods &mdash; was a lie, to decoy and be fool man. Little did he think, that it would be in &s;uch manner verified, as it is, by the incarnation of the &s;on of God.</P>
<P>And then this is the occa&s;ion al&s;o, of all the elect be|ing united to this divine per&s;on, &s;o that they become one with Chri&s;t; are as it were parts of him. Belie|vers are as Chri&s;t; or, members and parts of Chri&s;t. So the Church is called Chri&s;t. Little did &s;atan think, that his telling that lie to our fir&s;t parents,&mdash;Ye &s;hall be as Gods, would be the occa&s;ion of their being as Chri&s;t the Son of God.</P>
<P>Again, &s;atan is made a means of his own confu&s;ion in this:&mdash;It was &s;atan's de&s;ign in tempting man to &s;in, to make man his captive and &s;lave for ever; to have plagued him and triumphed over him. And this very thing is a means to bring it about, that man in&s;tead of being his va&s;&s;al &s;hould be his judge. It is the very means, that the elect, in&s;tead of being his captives, to be for ever tormented and triumphed over by him, &s;hould &s;it as judges to &s;entence him to everla&s;ting tor|ment. It has been the means, that one in man's nature, viz. Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould be his &s;upream judge. It was man's nature that &s;atan &s;o envied, and &s;ought to make a prey of. But Je&s;us Chri&s;t at the la&s;t day, &s;hall come in man's nature; and the devils &s;hall be all brought to &s;tand trembling at his bar: and he &s;hall judge, and condemn them, and execute the wrath of God upon them.</P>
<P>CHRIST &s;hall come in the human nature: in a na|ture in it &s;elf much inferior to the original nature of the devils&mdash;to do this. And this, &s;atan's tempting man to &s;in, has been the occa&s;ion of. For it was the fall of
<PB N="228" REF="009961_0341_0F7B3CD1BAACD020">
man that &s;atan procured, which was the occa&s;ion of Chri&s;t's being in the human nature.</P>
<P>And not only &s;hall Chri&s;t in the human nature judge the devils, but all the &s;aints &s;hall judge them with Chri&s;t; as a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors with him in judgment. 1 Cor. 6.3. <HI>Know ye not that we &s;hall judge angels.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> In another in&s;tance &s;atan is made a means of his own confu&s;ion; and that is in his procuring the death of Chri&s;t. Satan &s;et him&s;elf to oppo&s;e Chri&s;t as &s;oon as he appeared. He &s;ought by all means to pro|cure his ruin. He &s;et the jews again&s;t him. He filled the minds of the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees with the mo&s;t bit|ter per&s;ecuting malice again&s;t Chri&s;t. He &s;ought by all means to procure his death; and that he might be put to the mo&s;t ignominious death that could be. We read "that &s;atan entred into Judas, and tempted him to be|tray him. <HI>Luk.</HI> 22.3. And Chri&s;t &s;peaks of his &s;uffer|ings as being the effects of the power of darkne&s;s, Luk. 22.53. <HI>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye &s;tretched forth no hands again&s;t me: but this is your hour and the power of darkne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;atan hereby overthrows his own kingdom. Chri&s;t came into the world to de&s;troy the works of the devil. And this was the very thing that did it, viz. the death of Chri&s;t. Chri&s;t overcomes &s;atan by his blood. Here it is that the whole work of redemption is built, even the blood of Chri&s;t. The cro&s;s was the devil's own weapon. Chri&s;t overthrew &s;atan with this weapon. As David cut off Goliath's head with his own &s;word.</P>
<P>CHRIST's thus making &s;atan a means of his own confu&s;ion was typify<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of old by Sam&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s getting honey out of the carca&s;e of the lion. There is more implied in Sam&s;on's riddle. "Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the &s;trong came forth &s;weetne&s;s, than ever the phili&s;tines explain'd. And it was a &s;aying that is verify'd by Chri&s;t in a far more glorious manner than
<PB N="229" REF="009961_0342_0F7B3CD3DE8EE428">
by Sam&s;on's getting honey out of the carca&s;e of the lion. God's enemy and our's are taken in the pit which they them&s;elves have digged: and their own &s;oul is taken in the net which they have laid.</P>
<P>Thus we have &s;hewn in &s;ome mea&s;ure the wi&s;dom of this way of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>This introduces the next general head, which was to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="2">II. That this wi&s;dom is above the wi&s;dom of the Angels. This wi&s;dom is altogether divine. And tho' the angels are &s;pirits of glorious wi&s;dom, yet it was above their wi&s;dom to contrive &s;uch a way of &s;alvation. If it had been put to them to find out a way for man's redemption, they all would have been nonplus'd.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom of this contrivance appears to have been above the wi&s;dom of the angels by the following things.</P>
<P N="1">1. It appears that this wi&s;dom in that they them|&s;elves did not fully comprehend the contrivance, 'till they &s;aw it accompli&s;hed. They knew that man was to be redeemed, long before Chri&s;t came into the world: but yet they did not fully comprehend it until they &s;aw it. This is evident by the expre&s;&s;ion in the text. "That now might be known unto the principalities&mdash; the manifold wi&s;dom of God, i. e. <HI>Now</HI> the work is actually accompli&s;hed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Which implies that it was now new to them. If they under&s;tood no more of it now, than they had all along, the Apo&s;tle would never have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o; for he is &s;peak|ing of it as a my&s;tery, in a mea&s;ure kept hid until now.</P>
<P>They doubtle&s;s under&s;tood much of it before: but they did not under&s;tand all. They had a new di&s;co|very when Chri&s;t came and performed the work.</P>
<P>Now it is to be con&s;idered, that the angels had had four thou&s;and years time to contemplate and look into this affair. And they did &s;pend that time in &s;tudying of it; for they did not want inclination and de&s;ire to
<PB N="230" REF="009961_0343_0F7B3CD492A3AEC8">
under&s;tand it and look into it, as the &s;cripture teaches us. And they had a great deal to put them upon an attentive contemplation of it. For when it was made known that God had &s;uch a de&s;ign, it mu&s;t appear a wonderful thing to them. It was a new thing. They had &s;een their fellow Angels de&s;troyed without mercy. And this redeeming of the fallen &s;inful creature, was quite a new thing. It mu&s;t needs be a&s;toni&s;hing to them, when God had revealed this de&s;ign of mercy to them pre&s;ently after the fall; and had given an intima|tion of it, in &s;aying, "The &s;eed of the woman &s;hall brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head. They knew that God had &s;uch a de&s;ign; for they were from the beginning mini|&s;tring &s;pirits, &s;ent forth to mini&s;ter to tho&s;e that were the heirs of &s;alvation. They were &s;ent forth to mini|&s;ter to them, that were redeemed by Chri&s;t ever &s;ince the fall. They were pre&s;ent at the in&s;titution of the typical di&s;pen&s;ation, that was &s;o full of &s;hadows of go&s;pel things; as is evident by <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 69.17.</P>
<P>The angels contemplating the contrivance of our redemption was typified by the po&s;ture of the cheru|bims over the mercy &s;eat, over the ark. They were made bending down towards the ark and mercy &s;eat This is what the apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> is thought to have &s;ome reference to, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.12.</P>
<P>So that they for four thou&s;and years had been &s;tudy|ing this contrivance, and yet they did not fully compre|hend it till they &s;aw it accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>This &s;hews that the wi&s;dom of it was far above their wi&s;dom; for if they could not fully comprehend it af|ter it had been reveal'd that there was &s;uch a de&s;ign; and after much of it had already been made known, as it was in the old te&s;tament:&mdash;If they not with&s;tanding could not fully under&s;tand it, after they had &s;tudied four thou&s;and years together upon it; how much le&s;s could they have found it out of them&s;elves without any thing being ever made known to them of it. They that
<PB N="231" REF="009961_0344_0F7B3CD4D0066AC0">
have four th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;and years time to &s;tudy a thing, have &s;ufficient trial whether it be above their under&s;tanding or not.</P>
<P N="2">2. It will appear if we con&s;ider for what end this wi&s;|dom of God was made known unto them, viz. that they might admire and prize it. It was made known to them, that they might &s;ee how manifold it is; how great and glorious it is; that they might &s;ee the un&s;peakable depths of the riches of the wi&s;dom and knowledge of God, as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.33.</P>
<P>It was manife&s;ted to them that they might &s;ee the glory of God in it. It was &s;hewn unto the angels that they might &s;ee how great and wonderful the my&s;tery was. 1 Tim. 3.16. "Great is the my&s;tery of godli|ne&s;s: Godline&s;s: God was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, ju&s;ti|fied in the &s;pirit, &s;een of angels&mdash;</P>
<P>Now if the wi&s;dom of it were not far above their own under&s;tandings, this would not be &s;hewn them, for them to admire and prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. It appears in that they are &s;till contemplating of it; and endeavouring to &s;ee more and more of it. There is &s;o much wi&s;dom in this way of &s;alvation, that there is room for the faculties of Angels to employ them&s;elves to all eternity. It is evident that the An|gels are &s;till employing them&s;elves in endeavouring to &s;ee more and more of God's wi&s;dom appearing in the work of redemption, by 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.12. "Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Chri&s;t which was in them&mdash;did &s;ignify, when it te&s;tified before hand of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, and the glory that &s;hould fol|low. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto them|&s;elves, but unto us they did mini&s;ter the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the go&s;pel unto you, with the Holy-Gho&s;t &s;ent down from heaven; <HI>which things the angels de&s;ire to look into.</HI> It is not &s;aid, that they de&s;ire to look into it be|fore
<PB N="232" REF="009961_0345_0F7B3CD5878F0730">
Chri&s;t came; but they &s;till de&s;ire to look into it, after they have &s;een it accompli&s;hed. Now they don't &s;o perfectly comprehend all the wi&s;dom that is to be &s;een in it: but they are contemplating, looking into it, that they may &s;ee more and more; and never will have fully exhau&s;ted to all eternity: But here will &s;till in this work be room enough to employ the angelical un|der&s;tandings.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Hence we may learn the blindne&s;s of the world, that the wi&s;dom appearing in the work of redemption is no more admired in it. God has revealed this his glo|rious de&s;ign and contrivance to the world. He has &s;ent forth his go&s;pel, and cau&s;es it to be preached abroad in the world, to declare to the world his infinite wi&s;dom has been &s;et on work for man's &s;alvation. But how little is it regarded! There are &s;ome that do &s;ee; that have there eyes opened to behold the wondrous things of the go&s;pel, to &s;ee the glory of God in, and to admire the wi&s;dom of it. But the greater part are wholly blind to it. They &s;ee nothing in all this that is any way glorious and wonderful. Tho' the Angels are &s;o &s;urprized at, and &s;o attentively behold and con&s;ider, and account it worthy of their mo&s;t engaged and deep contemplation; yet the greater part of them that have the Go&s;pel here on earth, take little notice of it. It is all a dull &s;tory, and dead letter to them. They &s;ee no &s;uch wi&s;dom in it, as characterizes it to be of diving original. They are &s;o far from &s;eeing any wi&s;dom in it, that it is above the wi&s;dom of the Angels, that they can't &s;ee any thing in it above the wi&s;dom of men. They can di&s;cover nothing in it a|bove what is human, that &s;hould make them conclude that it is any thing more than the invention of men. Yea the go&s;pel to many &s;eems fooli&s;hne&s;s; &s;o that they
<PB N="233" REF="009961_0346_0F7B3CD639FE38D0">
que&s;tion whether it be of divine original or not. And there are many that do openly deny it.</P>
<P>Tho' the light that &s;hines in the world be &s;o exceed|ing glorious, yet how few are there that do &s;ee it. The glory of God's wi&s;dom in this work is &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the brightne&s;s of the &s;un: but &s;o blind is the world that it &s;ees nothing. It don't know that the &s;un of righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;hines.</P>
<P>Thus it has been in all ages, and wherever the go&s;|pel has been preached. Mini&s;ters of the word of God, in all ages have had occa&s;ion to &s;ay, Who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord re|vealed?</P>
<P>Thus it was of old, under the preaching of the pro|phets. They were &s;ent to many with that errand, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 6.9.10. "Go and tell this people, hear ye indeed, but under&s;tand not; and &s;ee ye indeed, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not. Make the heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and &s;hut their eyes, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and under&s;tand with their heart, and convert and be healed.</P>
<P>And &s;o it was in Chri&s;t's time, when that glorious prophet came, and more fully revealed the coun&s;els of God concerning our redemption. How many were there that were blind! How much did Chri&s;t com|plain of them! How blind were the &s;cribes and pha|ri&s;ees, the mo&s;t noted &s;ect of men among the jews for wi&s;dom; they beheld no glory in that go&s;pel which Chri&s;t preached unto them; &mdash;which gave occa&s;ion to Chri&s;t to call them fools and blind, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.17.</P>
<P>So it was again in the Apo&s;tles times. In all places where they preached, &s;ome believed, and &s;ome believed not, <HI>Acts</HI> 28.24. "As many as were ordained to eter|nal life believed, <HI>Chap.</HI> 13.4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. "The election obtained, but the re&s;t were blinded, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.7.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="009961_0347_0F7B3CD8766B4258">And &s;o it is &s;till in tho&s;e places where the go&s;pel is preached. There are a few that have their eyes open to &s;ee the glory of the go&s;pel. God has a &s;mall num|ber who&s;e eyes he opens, who are called out of dark|ne&s;s into marvellous light. Who have an under&s;tanding given them of the way of life, to &s;ee the wi&s;dom and fitne&s;s of that way.</P>
<P>But how many are there that &s;it under the preaching of the go&s;pel, all their days, that never &s;ee any divine wi&s;dom or glory in it! To their dying day they are unaffected with it. When they hear it, they &s;ee nothing to attract their attention, and excite any admiration. To preach the go&s;pel to them will &s;erve very well to lull them a&s;leep: but very little other effect upon them. This &s;hews the exceeding wickedne&s;s of the heart of man,&mdash;That infinite wi&s;dom &s;hould be &s;o &s;et on work, as to &s;urprize the Angels, and to enter|tain them from age to age;&mdash;and that this wi&s;dom &s;hould be &s;o plainly &s;et before men, and after all it &s;hould ap|pear fooli&s;hne&s;s 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.18. "The preaching of the cro&s;s is to them that peri&s;h fooli&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>Infer. II. This is a great confirmation of the truth of the go&s;pel. Thy go&s;pel &s;tands in no need of exter|nal evidences of its truth and divinity. It carries its own light and evidence with it. There is that in the nature of it that &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hes it to tho&s;e who are &s;piritually inlightened, from all the effects of human invention. There are the evident appearances of the divine perfections; the &s;tamp of divine glory, of which this of the divine wi&s;dom is not the lea&s;t part.</P>
<P>There is as much in the go&s;pel to &s;hew that it is no work of men, as there is in the &s;un in the firmament. Per&s;ons that are come to the mature exerci&s;e of their rea&s;on and look upon the &s;un, and con&s;ider the nature of it, its wonderful height, it's cour&s;e, it's brightne&s;s and heat, may know that it is no work of man. so if the
<PB N="235" REF="009961_0348_0F7B3CD99DAA5088">
nature of the go&s;pel be duly con&s;idered, if the true na|ture of it is &s;een, it may be known that it is no work of man, and that it mu&s;t be from God.</P>
<P>If the wi&s;dom appearing in the go&s;pel be duly con&s;i|dered and under&s;tood, it will be &s;een as much to excel all human wi&s;dom, as the &s;un's light excells the light of fires of our own inkindling.</P>
<P>The contrivance of our &s;alvation is of &s;uch a nature, as that no one that duly con&s;iders it can rationally con|clude that man had any hand in it. The nature of the contrivance is &s;uch, &s;o out of the way of all human thoughts, of a nature &s;o different from all human inventions; &s;o much more &s;ublime, excellent and wor|thy, that it don't &s;avour at all of the craft or &s;ubtilty of man: it &s;avours of God.</P>
<P>If any are ready to think man might have found out &s;uch a way of the &s;alvation of &s;inners; &s;o honourable to God, to his holine&s;s and authority, they don't well con&s;ider the &s;cantine&s;s of human under&s;tanding. Man|kind were of a poor capacity for any &s;uch Undertaking; for 'till the go&s;pel inlighten'd the world they had but mi&s;erable notions of what was honourable to God. They could have but poor notions of what way would be &s;uitable to the divine perfections; for they were wofully in the dark about the&s;e divine perfections them|&s;elves, till the go&s;pel came abroad in the world. They were ignorant of the nature and perfections of God. They had &s;trange notions about a Deity. Mo&s;t of them thought there were many Gods. "They chang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the glory of the incorruptible God into an image like to corruptible man, and to birds and four footed bea&s;ts and creeping things, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.23. They attributed vices to God. Even the philo&s;ophers, their wi&s;e&s;t men en|tertain'd but imperfect notions of the &s;upream Being.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="009961_0349_0F7B3CDAACDEE0A0">How then &s;hould man find out a way &s;o glorious and honorable to God, and agreable to his perfections, who had not wi&s;dom enough to get any tolerable notions of God, till the go&s;pel was revealed to them. They groped in the dark. Their notions &s;hew'd the infinite in&s;ufficiency of man's blind under&s;tanding, for any &s;uch undertaking, as the contriving a way of &s;alvation, every way honorable to God, and &s;uitable to the needs of a fallen creature.</P>
<P>But &s;ince the go&s;pel has told what God's coun&s;els are, and how he has contrived a way for our &s;alvation, men are ready to de&s;pi&s;e it, and fooli&s;hly to exalt their own under&s;tanding; and to imagine they could have found out as good a way them&s;elves. When, alas! men of them&s;elves had no notion of what was honorable to God, and &s;uitable for a divine being. They did not &s;o much as think of the nece&s;&s;ity of God's law being an&s;wered, and ju&s;tice &s;atisfied. And if they had, how dreadfully would they have been puzzled to have found out the way <HI>how.</HI> Who would have thought of a trinity of per&s;ons in the godhead; and that one &s;hould &s;u&s;tain the rights of the Godhead; and another &s;hould be the Mediator; and another &s;hould make application of re|demption!</P>
<P>Who would have thought of &s;uch a thing as three di&s;tinct per&s;ons, and yet but one God! all the &s;ame Being, and yet three per&s;ons! Who would have tho't of this, in order to have found out a way for the &s;atis|fying ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Who would have thought of a way for the an&s;wering the law that threatned eternal death, without the &s;in|ner's &s;uffering eternal death.</P>
<P>And who would have thought of any &s;uch thing as a Per&s;on that was God, a divine Per&s;on <HI>&s;uffering the wroth of God!</HI> And if they had; who would have

<P>Who would have thought of any &s;uch thing as Gods becoming man; two natures and but one per&s;on! The&s;e things are exceedingly out of the way of human tho't and contrivance. It is mo&s;t unrea&s;onable to think that the world, who till the go&s;pel enlightned them, were &s;o blind about the nature of God, and divine things, &s;hould contrive &s;uch a way that &s;hould prove thus to an&s;wer all ends; every way to &s;uit with what the ca&s;e required; every way mo&s;t glorious to God; every way an&s;wera|ble to all man's nece&s;&s;ities: wherein every thing is &s;o fully provided for, and no ab&s;urdity to be found in the whole affair, but all &s;peaking forth the mo&s;t perfect wi&s;dom. That there &s;hould be no infringement upon the holine&s;s of God, or on the ju&s;tice of God; nothing di&s;honourable to the maje&s;ty of God; no encourage|ment to &s;in, all po&s;&s;ible motives to holine&s;s: &mdash; all manner of happine&s;s provided; &s;atan &s;o confounded and entirely overthrown.</P>
<P>And if we &s;uppo&s;e that all this notwith&s;tanding was the invention of men, who&s;e invention &s;hould it be! Who &s;hould be pitched upon as the mo&s;t likely to in|vent it. It was not the invention of the jews; for they were the mo&s;t bitter enemies to it. The wi&s;e men a|mong them, when they fir&s;t heard of it, they conceived a virulent malice again&s;t it, and per&s;ecuted all that held this doctrine: And &s;o they do to this day entertain a great hatred of the whole doctrine of the contrivance of our &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It was not the invention of the heathen; for the heathen knew nothing about it, till the apo&s;tles preach'd it to them. It was a new doctrine to them; and ap|peared a very fooli&s;h doctrine to the wi&s;e men among them. The doctrine of Chri&s;t crucified was to the Jews a &s;tumbling block, and to the Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.23.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="009961_0351_0F7B3CDB82DDDF18">And be&s;ides, it was contrary to all their notions about a deity, they knew nothing about the true God the fall of man, and the like, till the go&s;pel revea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d it to them.</P>
<P>It was not the invention of the apo&s;tles; for the a|po&s;tles of them&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ves, were no way capable of any &s;uch learned contrivance. They were nothing but a parcel of poor fi&s;hermen and publicans, an ob&s;cure and illite|rate &s;ort of men, 'till they were extraordinarily taught. And be&s;ides it could not be their invention; for they were all &s;urpriz'd when they fir&s;t heard of it. When they heard that Chri&s;t mu&s;t die for &s;inners, they were offended at it: It looked &s;trange to them: And it was a long while before they were brought fully to receive it.</P>
<P>It could not be the invention of any other chri&s;tians; for there were no other chri&s;tians, but only tho&s;e that were converted by the preaching and the writings of the apo&s;tles, and other di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t that were under them.</P>
<P>There is but one Way left, and that is, to &s;uppo&s;e, That Chri&s;t was a mere man, and a very &s;ubtil crafty man, and that he invented it all: But this is as unrea|&s;onable as the re&s;t; for if Chri&s;t had been a meer man, it would have been all again&s;t him&s;elf, to invent a way of &s;alvation, by his own crucifixion, which he knew he could get nothing by, but a mo&s;t tormenting and igno|minious death.</P>

<P>INF. III. HOW great a &s;in they are guilty of who de&s;pi&s;e and reject this way of &s;alvation. When God hath thus as it were &s;et wi&s;dom on work, and has manife&s;ted &s;uch un&s;earchable riches of wi&s;dom, When all the per&s;ons of the trinity have as it were held a con&s;ultation from all eternity, in contriving for the providing a way of &s;alvation for us &s;inful mi&s;erable worms. To contrive a way that &s;hould be &s;ufficient for us, and every way &s;uitable for us. To contrive a way that &s;hould be &s;uch a way as we want, &s;o as to an&s;wer all our needs. To contrive a way that &s;hould be in all things compleat, whereby we might have compleat &s;al|vation, not only full pardon of all our &s;ins, and delive|rance from hell; but have full ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in heaven forever. When he has been &s;o gracious to us as to magni|fy his wi&s;dom, more in this work of grace towards men, than in any other work of his.&mdash;How mu&s;t God needs be provok'd, when after all, men reject this way of &s;al|vation!</P>
<P>When it comes to be preached to them, and &s;alvation is offered to them, and &s;alvation is offered to them in this way; and they are invited to accept of the benefits of it, they de&s;pi&s;e it, and refu&s;e &s;alvation in that way.
<PB N="240" REF="009961_0353_0F7B3CDD2BA52438">
They ca&s;t contempt upon all this rich and glorious wi&s;|dom of God. They do practically deny it to be a wi&s;e way. And call this wi&s;dom of God fooli&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>How provoking mu&s;t it be when&mdash;&s;uch a poor crea|ture as man &s;hall ri&s;e up and find fault with that wi&s;dom which is &s;o far above the wi&s;dom of the angels of hea|ven, as tho' the way that God had found out was an un&s;uitable, an in&s;ufficient way.</P>
<P>This is one thing wherein con&s;i&s;ts the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;in of unbelief, that it implies a rejecting and de&s;pi|&s;ing the wi&s;dom of God in the way of &s;alvation by Je|&s;us Chri&s;t. It charges God with folly in this contri|vance.</P>
<P>Unbelief finds fault with the wi&s;dom of God in the choice of the per&s;on, as tho' God had made an un|wi&s;e choice of the per&s;on for the performing this work&punc; It di&s;likes the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t. It &s;ees no form or comeline&s;s in him, or beauty wherefore he &s;hould de|&s;ire him. Accounts him in&s;ufficient for the work that he has been cho&s;en and appointed to.</P>
<P>That per&s;on that the wi&s;dom of God looked upon as the fitte&s;t per&s;on of any what&s;oever, and the only fit per&s;on, is de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected by unbelief.</P>
<P>Men thro' unbelief find fault with the Salvation it|&s;elf that Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed: They don't like to be &s;aved as Chri&s;t would &s;ave. They don't like to be made holy, and to have &s;uch a happine&s;s as is to be had in God for a portion.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s here to mention two or three ways whereby per&s;ons are guilty of a provoking con|tempt of the wi&s;dom of God in the way of &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="1">1. They are guilty of a provoking contempt, who live in a carele&s;s neglect of their &s;alvation: They that are &s;ecure in their &s;ins, and are not much concerned a|bout &s;alvation or damnation. Are not &s;o much as ear|ne&s;tly &s;eeking &s;alvation. This is a practical charging God with folly in this affair.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="009961_0354_0F7B3CDDC52181D0">The language of it is, that it is all in vain, and to no purpo&s;e that God hath contrived and con&s;ulted for the obtaining &s;alvation, when there was no need of it. That he has laid out him&s;elf, and been at great co&s;t to procure &s;alvation for them when they don't want &s;alvation. They are well enough as they are. They don't &s;ee any great nece&s;&s;ity they are in of a &s;aviour. They like that &s;tate they are in, and do not much de&s;ire to be de|livered out of it.</P>
<P>They don't thank him for all his con&s;ultation and contrivance. They think he might have &s;pared his co&s;t. They do as much as &s;ay, that God greatly cared for the finding out and accompli&s;hing a way of &s;alvation; where|as they don't think it worth their caring about. God has greatly minded that, which they don't think worth a minding. God has contrived abundantly for that which they don't trouble their heads about.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are guilty of a provoking contempt of the wi&s;dom of this way of &s;alvation, who go about to con|trive ways of their own. They that are not con|tent with that way of &s;alvation by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, which God has provided, are for contriving &s;ome way of being &s;aved by their own righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e find fault with the wi&s;dom of God's way that is &s;o much above the wi&s;dom of the angels, and &s;et up their own wi&s;dom in oppo&s;ition to it. They &s;et up their own wi&s;dom above God's, as tho' they could find out a better way.</P>
<P>How greatly mu&s;t God be provoked when per&s;ons thus &s;et up their own wi&s;dom above that infinite wi&s;dom manife&s;ted in the way of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. Tho&s;e that entertain di&s;couraged and di&s;pairing apprehen&s;ions about their &s;alvation, ca&s;t contempt on the wi&s;dom of God. They that entertain &s;uch thoughts as that, becau&s;e they have been &s;uch great &s;inners, God will not be willing to pardon them: Chri&s;t will not be
<PB N="242" REF="009961_0355_0F7B3CDE80C9A518">
willing to accept of them. They fear Chri&s;t, in the invitations of the go&s;pel don't mean &s;uch wicked crea|tures as they are. They fear they have committed &s;o much &s;in, that they have &s;inn'd beyond the reach of the mercy of God. They think it is in vain for them to &s;eek for &s;alvation.</P>
<P>The&s;e ca&s;t contempt on the wi&s;dom of God in the way of &s;alvation, as tho' the way was not an al&s;uffici|ent way. As tho' the wi&s;dom of God had not found out a way that was &s;ufficient for the &s;alvation of great &s;inners:&mdash;As tho' God had not found out a way to make &s;atisfaction for &s;o many and &s;o great &s;ins.&mdash;</P>
<P>As tho' the wi&s;dom of God had not pitched upon a per&s;on worthy enough to be a mediator for &s;uch great &s;inners.</P>
<P>INF. IV. Hence the mi&s;ery of unbelievers who have no portion or lot in this matter. There is a mo&s;t glori|ous way of &s;alvation, but you have no intere&s;t in it. The wi&s;dom of God hath been gloriou&s;ly imploy'd for the deliverance of men from a mi&s;erable, doleful &s;tate; and procure happine&s;s for them; but you are never the better for it, becau&s;e you reject it: You don't fall in with it: You don't comply with God's coun&s;els and de&s;igns in this affair. This way of &s;alvation is preach|ed to you in vain. If you continue in that &s;tate that you are in, you will not be the better for its being &s;uch a wi&s;e way. This wi&s;dom will do you no good.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom of God has pitched upon a mo&s;t fit and &s;uitable Per&s;on for the accompli&s;hing this work; but you have no intere&s;t in him. Chri&s;t is a glorious Per|&s;on; every way fit to be a &s;aviour of &s;inners; a per&s;on that has power &s;ufficient, and wi&s;dom &s;ufficient, and merit &s;ufficient, and love &s;ufficient for the perfecting this work. And he is the only fit per&s;on for the perfecting of it; but you have no right in him; you can lay claim to no benefit by his power, wi&s;dom, love or merits</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="009961_0356_0F7B3CE019677E88">This wi&s;dom of God hath found out a way where|by this &s;aviour might &s;ati&s;fy ju&s;tice, and fulfil the law for us. He hath found our a way whereby he might be capable of &s;uffering for us, viz. That he &s;hould be|come man, and be both God and man: But you have no lot in this matter of the incarnation, death and &s;ufferings of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom of God hath contrived a way of &s;alvation that there &s;hould be procur'd for us perfect &amp; everla&s;ting happine&s;s. The wi&s;dom of God hath contrived that there &s;hould be procured for fallen man all the good that he &s;tands in need of. Here is purcha&s;'d peace with God and the favour of God. Here is that happine&s;s pro|cured that is mo&s;t &s;uitable to our nature, and an&s;wer|able to the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls. Here is a mo&s;t glo|rious portion purcha&s;ed for us, <HI>viz.</HI> The divine Being him&s;elf, with his glorious perfections. Here it is pur|cha&s;'d that we &s;hould &s;ee God face to face;&mdash;That we &s;hould conver&s;e with God; and dwell with God in his own glorious habitation. 'Tis purcha&s;'d that we &s;hould be the children of God;&mdash; and be conformed to him.</P>
<P>Here is procured for worms every &s;ort of good that human nature craves the highe&s;t honours,&mdash; the mo&s;t abundant riches,&mdash; the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial &s;atisfying plea|&s;ures forevermore.</P>
<P>Here God hath contrived a way for the meriting all needed good both for the &s;ouls and bodies of &s;inner: All needed earthly good things, while here; and glory for both body and &s;oul hereafter, forever.</P>
<P>But you are never the better for all this&punc; You have no lot, or portion in any of it. Notwith&s;tanding all this rich provi&s;ion, you remain in the &s;ame mi&s;erable &s;tate and condition, in which you came i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the world. Tho' the provi&s;ion of the Go&s;pel be &s;o full, yet your poor &s;oul remains in a fami&s;hing, peri&s;hing &s;tate and condition.

of &s;atan: In a condemned &s;tate, having the wrath of God abiding on you, and being daily expo&s;ed to the dreadful effects of it, in hell; notwith&s;tanding all this provi&s;ion, you yet remain wretched and mi&s;erable, poor and blind and naked. O that you might turn to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, be number'd among his di&s;ciples &amp; faith|full followers, and &s;o be intitled to their priviledges! They have an intere&s;t in this glorious &s;aviour, and are intitled to all the ineffable ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of his kingdom, &s;o far as their capacities will admit: But you remain with|out Chri&s;t, being aliens from the common wealth of I&s;rael, &s;trangers to the covenant of promi&s;e, having no well-grounded hope, and without God in the world.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider &s;everal things,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. It argues the greatne&s;s of the mi&s;ery of &s;in|ners, that the wi&s;dom of God &s;hould be exerci&s;ed to &s;uch a degree to find out a way to deliver them from it. It &s;hews that their mi&s;ery was very great. Their ca&s;e &s;urely was mo&s;t deplorable: It required infinite wi&s;dom to find out a way for their deliverance.</P>
<P>It &s;hews how far they were &s;unk into mi&s;ery, that there could be no contrivance for their deliverance, but the contrivance of the wi&s;dom of the great God. The wi&s;dom of the angels was not &s;ufficient: Nothing but divine wi&s;dom could reach and remedy their ca&s;e. And that God &s;hould &s;o lay out him&s;elf, that all the per&s;ons of the Trinity &s;hould enter into &s;uch a con&s;ul|tation about it. And that the greate&s;t wi&s;dom; that &s;hould appear mo&s;t wonderful in the &s;ight of the Angels, &s;hould be exerci&s;ed about this affair. It is not likely it &s;hould be &s;o, unle&s;s the affair be very great. If mans mi&s;ery was not very great, divine wi&s;dom would not have been exerci&s;ed for his deliverance from it. God would not contrive and do things &s;o wonderful in a trivial Affair. If the &s;alvation of a &s;inner was not a great &s;alvation, from an exceeding great mi&s;ery, 'tis
<PB N="245" REF="009961_0358_0F7B3CE1802068E0">
not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that God's wi&s;dom &s;hould be more &s;ignalized in this affair than in any other whatever.</P>
<P>But &s;o it is; this contrivance &s;eems to be &s;poken of in &s;cripture as the ma&s;ter piece of divine wi&s;dom. This work of redemption is repre&s;ented as mo&s;t wonderful, &s;poken of in &s;cripture in the mo&s;t exalted manner of any work of God. Doubtle&s;s therefore &s;alvation is a great thing: And con&s;equently the mi&s;ery that &s;inners are &s;aved from is a great and un&s;peakable mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>This is the mi&s;ery that all you are in, who remain in a natural condition. This is the condemnation you lie under. This is the wrath of God that abides upon you. The wi&s;dom of God knew it to be a very doleful thing for a per&s;on to be in a natural &s;tate, and therefore did &s;o exerci&s;e it&s;elf to deliver mi&s;erable &s;inners out of it. But this is the &s;tate that many among us do yet remain in.</P>
<P>Secondly. Con&s;ider that if you continue in the &s;tate you are in, you will be &s;o far from being the better for this contrivance, that you will be a great deal the more mi&s;erable for it. You will be a great deal the more mi&s;erable for there being &s;uch a wi&s;e way, &s;uch an ex|cellent way of &s;alvation found out. It would have been better for you, if the way of &s;alvation had been an im|perfect way, an in&s;ufficient way: Or, if there had been no way at all. The ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom of the way of &s;alvation will be your condemnation. "This is the condemnation that, light is come into the world, and men loved darkne&s;s rather than light". Joh. 3. 19.</P>
<P>That will be your condemnation, that God contriv'd an infinitely wi&s;e way of &s;alvation, wherein compleat &s;alvation was procured for &s;inners, and you refu&s;ed to accept of it, but &s;till went on in your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>If you continue in the &s;tate that you are now in, it would have been better for you, if Chri&s;t had never di|ed for &s;inners: If God had left all mankind to peri&s;h,
<PB N="246" REF="009961_0359_0F7B3CE29888AB90">
as he did the fallen Angel. Your puni&s;hment then would have been light in compari&s;on of what it will be now.</P>
<P>You will have greater &s;ins by far to an&s;wer for; and all your &s;ins will he abundantly the more aggravated.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince I have been upon this &s;ubject, ob&s;erved that the work of redemption is an occa&s;ion of the elect's being brought to greater happine&s;s than man could have had if he had not fallen. But this is a &s;o true as to reprobates. It will be an occa&s;ion of their having greater mi&s;ery than they would have had, if there had been no redemp|tion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cor 2.15. "For we are unto God, a &s;weet &s;avour of Chri&s;t in them that are &s;aved and in them that peri&s;h. To the one we are a &s;avour of death unto death; and to the other we are a &s;avour of life unto life". If you peri&s;h at la&s;t you will be the more mi|&s;erable for the benefits of the go&s;pel being &s;o glorious, and that becau&s;e your crime in rejecting and de&s;pi&s;ing them will be the more heinous. If Chri&s;t had purcha|&s;ed comparatively &s;mall happine&s;s for &s;inners: &mdash; If he had purcha&s;ed a happine&s;s that was imperfect, un&s;atis|factory, and but of finite duration, it would have been better for you, Heb. 2.3. "How &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation".</P>
<P>Thirdly. Whil&s;t you continue an unbeliever, the more you hear of this way of &s;alvation, your condition will become the more mi&s;erable. The longer you &s;it under the preaching of the go&s;pel, the more doleful does your ca&s;e grow. Your guilt continually increa&s;es. For your refu&s;als of the calls of the go&s;pel, and your rejections of this way of &s;alvation, are &s;o much the oft|ner repeated. Every time you hear the go&s;pel preach|ed, you are guilty of a renewed rejection of it, the guilt of which therefore you will have lying upon you.</P>
<P>And the more you hear of the &s;uitablene&s;s and glo|riou&s;ne&s;s of this way, the greater is your guilt who &s;till
<PB N="247" REF="009961_0360_0F7B3CE365ABD068">
continue to reject it. Every new illu&s;tration of the wi&s;dom of God, and grace of God in redemption, adds to your guilt, Mat. 23.37 "O Jeru&s;alem Jeru&s;alem&mdash; how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not!"</P>
<P>And that which adds to the mi&s;ery you are under, is, that as long as it continues, it is a growing evil.</P>
<P>Fourthly. Con&s;ider the danger there is, that you will never have any lot or portion in this matter. You mu&s;t con&s;ider that there are but few that have. Chri&s;t has told us that &s;trait is the gate and na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">row is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. There have been but few in all ages of the world. Ma|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eek; and many hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that they &s;hall obtain. There are but few that intend to be damned. There are ma|ny that hope that they &s;hall &s;ome way or other find means to e&s;cape eternal mi&s;ery But after all, there are but few &s;aved. But few obtain the benefits of re|demption.</P>
<P>I conclude with a</P>
<P><HI>USE</HI> of EXHORTATION to come to Chri&s;t, and accept of &s;alvation in this way. You are invited to come to Chri&s;t, heartily to clo&s;e with him, and tru&s;t in him for &s;alvation: And if you do &s;o, you &s;hall be one that &s;hall have the benefit of this glo|rious contrivance. You &s;hall have the benefit of all as much as if the whole end had been contrived for you alone.</P>
<P>God has already contrived and done every thing that is needful to your &s;alvation; and there is nothing want|ing but your con&s;ent. Since God has taken this matter of the redemption of &s;inners into his own hand, he has made thorough work of it; he has not left it for you to fini&s;h. Satisfaction is already made, righteou&s;ne&s;s is
<PB N="248" REF="009961_0361_0F7B3CE3CECCBDF8">
already wrought out; there is nothing for you to do. Death and hell are already conquer'd. The redeemer has already taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of glory, and keeps it in his hands to be&s;tow on them that come to him. There were many difficulties in the way, but they are all re|moved. The &s;aviour has already triumphed over all, and is already in heaven at the right hand of God, to give eternal life to his people.</P>
<P>Salvation is ready brought to your door; and the &s;a|viour &s;tands and knocks and calls that you would open to him, that he might bring it in to you. There re|mains nothing but your con&s;ent. All the difficulty now remaining is with your own heart. If you peri&s;h now, it mu&s;t be wholly at your door. It mu&s;t be becau&s;e you would not come to Chri&s;t that you might have life: And becau&s;e you virtually choo&s;e death rather than life, Prov. 8.36. "He that &s;inneth again&s;t me wrongeth his own &s;oul: All they that hate me love death".</P>
<P>All that is now required of you, is, that your heart &s;hould clo&s;e with Chri&s;t as a &s;aviour. Here con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the wi&s;dom of God hath &s;o contrived that he hath fore&s;talled all our objections. If you make ob|jections again&s;t Chri&s;t and the way of &s;alvation, they mu&s;t be all unrea&s;onable. You can't rea&s;onably object that your &s;ins are of &s;uch a nature, that God's honour won't allow of your pardon. 'Tis true God in&s;i&s;ts upon his own honour. He is a God that will be ho|noured, and his maje&s;ty &s;hall be vindicated: And when &s;inners ca&s;t contempt upon him, his honour requires vengeance: But God has &s;o contrived this way, that his honour may be repaired by the puni&s;hment of &s;in without the &s;inners &s;uffering, how great &s;oever the &s;in be. Herein the wi&s;dom of this way appears, that there is a &s;ufficiency for the greate&s;t and mo&s;t heinous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="009961_0362_0F7B3CE5D51F2E48">You can't ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ect that God the father will not be willing to accept you, for the mediator's &s;ake; for he hath cho&s;en &s;uch a per&s;on as his own &s;on, a per&s;on &s;o near and dear to him to be a mediator, to cut off any &s;uch objections. So you may be &s;ure that God will receive you if you go to him thro' Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>You can't object that God the father has not given &s;ufficient a&s;&s;urance of &s;alvation to believers; for God has not only promi&s;ed, but the principal things; tho&s;e which would have been mo&s;t difficult to believe, are already fulfilled; God has already given his &s;on to die for us. This, before it was accompli&s;hed, was a thing a great deal more &s;trange, and difficult to believe, than that he &s;hould give eternal life to &s;inners after Chri&s;t died for them. That the &s;on of God &s;hould die, was a much greater thing, than to give eternal life upon the account of it. Rom. 8.32. "He that &s;pared not his own &s;on, but delivered him up for us all, how &s;hall he not with him freely give us a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l things."</P>
<P>And then there is no room to doubt but that if we accept of Chri&s;t, God will give eternal life; for he hath given it already into the hands of our &s;aviour for us. He hath betru&s;ted him with the whole affair. He hath given all things into his hands, that he might give eter|nal life to as many as &s;hould come to him. The fa|ther hath appointed him that died for believers, to be their judge, to have the whole determination of the mat|ter and di&s;po&s;al of the reward, in his own hand. And you can't doubt but that Chri&s;t will be willing to be|&s;tow eternal life on them that he purcha&s;ed it for. For if he is not willing to be&s;tow it, &s;urely he never would have died to purcha&s;e it. Who can think that Chri&s;t would be &s;o de&s;irous of &s;inners being &s;aved, as to un|dergo &s;o much for it; and not be willing to let them have it, when he had obtained it for them.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="250" REF="009961_0363_0F7B3CE66B9A79C0">2. The wi&s;dom of God hath contrived that there &s;hould be in the per&s;on of the &s;aviour all manner of at|tractives to draw us to him. He has not cho&s;en a mean per&s;on, a per&s;on of but indifferent loveline&s;s, le&s;t &s;inners &s;hould &s;ay, that there was not excellency enough in Chri&s;t to draw them to him. He did not pitch upon one of the Angels; for tho' they are excellent creatures, yet their excellency is but finite. But he hath pitched upon his own &s;on, that there might be no want of ex|cellency in the per&s;on. He is not a per&s;on who&s;e ex|cellency is but finite. He hath in him all po&s;&s;ible ex|cellency. He is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all the beauty and glory of the God-head.</P>
<P>So that there can be no manner of excellency, nor degree of excellency that we can devi&s;e, but what is in the per&s;on of the &s;aviour. By this, it appears, Chri&s;t has excellency enough. For to &s;ay, that excellency which is infinite is not enough, is a contradiction.</P>
<P>But yet &s;o redundant has the wi&s;dom of God been in providing attractives to us to come to Chri&s;t, it hath &s;o or|dered that there &s;hould al&s;o be all human excellencies in him. If there be any thing attractive in this con&s;idera|tion, that Chri&s;t is one in our own nature, one of us; this is true of Chri&s;t. He is not only in the divine, but in the human nature. He is a man like our&s;elves; and has all po&s;&s;ible human excellencies. He was of a mo&s;t excellent &s;pirit. He was wi&s;e and holy. He was of a conde&s;cending, meek and lowly, a benign and benevo|lent di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>And again: The wi&s;dom of God hath cho&s;en &s;uch a per&s;on who &s;hould be a per&s;on of a great love to &s;in|ners, and &s;hould &s;how that love in the mo&s;t endearing manner po&s;&s;ible. What more conde&s;cending love can there be, than the love of a divine per&s;on to &s;uch worms of the du&s;t! And what freer love can there be than love to enemies! And what greater love can there be,
<PB N="251" REF="009961_0364_0F7B3CE748908140">
than dying love! And what more endearing expre&s;&s;ion of love, than dying for the beloved! So that here is not only the excellency of Chri&s;t, but his love to man|kind to draw us.</P>
<P>Again, the wi&s;dom of God hath &s;o contrived that Chri&s;t &s;hall &s;u&s;tain that office that &s;hould mo&s;t tend to endear him to us, and draw us to him: The office of a redeemer, a redeemer from eternal mi&s;ery, and the purcha&s;er of all happine&s;s.</P>
<P>And if all this be not enough to draw us, the wi&s;dom of God hath ordered more: It hath provided us a &s;avi|our that &s;hould offer him&s;elf to us in the mo&s;t endear|ing relation. He offers to receive us as friends. To receive us to an union to him&s;elf, to become our &s;piri|tual hu&s;band and portion forever.</P>
<P>And if all this is not enough to draw, there is more yet. The wi&s;dom of God hath provided us a &s;aviour that woos us in a manner that has the greate&s;t tendency to win our hearts. His word is mo&s;t attractive. He &s;tands at our door and knocks. He don't meerly com|mand us to receive him; but he conde&s;cends to apply him&s;elf to us in a more endearing manner. He intreats and be&s;eeches us in his word and by his me&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P N="3">3. The wi&s;dom of God hath contrived that there &s;hould be all manner of attractives in the benefits that Chri&s;t offers you. There are not only the excellencies of the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t to draw you to him, but the de&s;irable benefits he offers. Here is what is mo&s;t &s;uita|ble to the cravings of the human nature: Needed re|lief for all our di&s;tre&s;&s;es.&mdash;Men when di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and burden'd, long for ea&s;e and re&s;t. Here it is offered to us in Chri&s;t. Come unto me, &s;ays he, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t.</P>
<P>Men when in fear of danger, long for &s;afety. Here it is provided for us in Chri&s;t. God promi&s;es that he will become the &s;hield and buckler, &s;trong rock and
<PB N="252" REF="009961_0365_0F7B3CE7880EE978">
high tower to tho&s;e that tru&s;t in him.&mdash;Tho&s;e that mourn need comfort: Chri&s;t tells us that he came to comfort tho&s;e that mourn, I&s;ai. 61.2.</P>
<P>The blind need to have their eyes opened. The light is &s;weet to men: Chri&s;t offers to anoint our eyes with eye &s;alve that we may &s;ee glorious light. He will be our &s;un, and the light of God's countenance.</P>
<P>What is more dear to men than life? Chri&s;t hath purcha&s;ed for men, that they &s;hould live forever, P&s;al. 21.4. "He a&s;ked life of thee and thou gave&s;t it him, even length of days forever and ever".</P>
<P>How greatly is a crown prized and admired by the children of men? And Chri&s;t offers this,&mdash;not a cor|ruptable crown, but an incorruptable and far more glo|rious crown than any worn by earthly kings. A crown of glory, the lu&s;tre of which &s;hall never fade or decay&mdash; an everla&s;ting kingdom.</P>
<P>Men love plea&s;ures. Here are plea&s;ures forever|more. What could there be more to draw our hearts to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to make us willing to accept of him for our &s;aviour; and to accept of his benefits, in that glo|rious and wi&s;e way that he has provided for us!</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE apo&s;tle is here &s;etting forth the excellencies of the grace of faith, by the glorious effects and happy i&s;&s;ue of it in the &s;aints of the old te&s;tament. He had &s;poken in the proceeding part of the chapter perticularly, of <HI>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abra|ham</HI> and <HI>Sarah, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob.</HI> Having enumerated tho&s;e in&s;tances, he takes notice that "the&s;e all died in faith, not having received the promi&s;es, but having &s;een them afar off, and were per&s;uaded of them &amp; embraced them, and confe&s;&s;ed that they were &s;trangers" &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the&s;e words the apo&s;tle &s;eems to have a more particular re&s;pect to Abraham and Sarah, and their kindred that came with them from Haran, and from Ur

of the chaldees, by the 15. ver. where the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "And truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had op|portunity to have returned". It was they that upon God's call left their own country.</P>
<P>Two things may be ob&s;erved in the text.</P>
<P N="1">1. What the&s;e &s;aints confe&s;&s;ed of them&s;elves, viz. "that they were &s;trangers and pilgrims on the earth".</P>
<P>Thus we have a particular account concerning Abra|ham, "I am a <HI>&s;tranger</HI> and a <HI>&s;ojourner</HI> with you".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 23.4.</NOTE> And it &s;eems to have been the general &s;en&s;e of the patriarchs, by what Jacob &s;ays to Pharaoh. "And Jacob &s;aid to Pharaoh, the days of the years of my <HI>pilgrimage</HI> are an hundred and thirty years: Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their <HI>pilgrimage</HI>". <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Gen. 47.9.</NOTE> "I am a <HI>&s;tranger</HI> and a <HI>&s;ojourner</HI> with thee, as all my fathers were." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm&punc; 39.12.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. The inference that the apo&s;tle draws from hence, (viz.) that they &s;ought another country as their home. "For they that &s;ay &s;uch things, declare plainly that they &s;eek a country." In confe&s;&s;ing that they were &s;trangers, they plainly declared that this is not their country; that this is not the country where they are at home. And in confe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be pilgrims, they declar'd plainly that this is not their &s;ettled abode; but that they have re&s;pect to &s;ome other country, that they &s;eek and are travelling to as their home.</P>

If we are &s;urrounded with many outward enjoyments, and things that are very comfortable to us: If we are &s;ettled in families, and have tho&s;e good friends and relations that are very de&s;ireable: If we have companions who&s;e &s;o|ciety is delightful to us: If we have children that are plea&s;ant and hopeful, and in whom we &s;ee many pro|mi&s;ing qualifications: If we live by good neighbours; have much of the re&s;pect of others; have a good name; are generally beloved where we are known: And have comfortable and plea&s;ant accommodations: Yet we ought not to take our re&s;t in the&s;e things. We &s;hould not be willing to have the&s;e things for our portion, but &s;hould &s;eek a higher happine&s;s in another world. We &s;hould not meerly &s;eek &s;omething el&s;e in addition to the&s;e things; but &s;hould be &s;o far from re&s;t|ing in them, that we &s;hould chu&s;e and de&s;ire to leave the&s;e things for heaven; to go to God and Chri&s;t there.

We &s;hould chu&s;e and de|&s;ire to leave them all in God's due time, that we might go to heaven, and there have the enjoyment of God. We ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s them, enjoy and make u&s;e of them,

with no other view or aim, but readily to quit them, whenever we are called to it, and to change them for heaven. And when we are called a way from them, we &s;hould go chearfully and willingly.</P>
<P>He that is going a journey, is not wont to re&s;t in what he meets with that is comfortable and plea&s;ing on the road. If he pa&s;&s;es along thro' plea&s;ant places, flowery meadows or &s;hady groves; he don't take up his content in the&s;e things. He is content only to take a trancient view of the&s;e plea&s;ant objects as he goes along. He is not enticed by the&s;e fine appearances to put an end to his journey, and leave off the thought of proceed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng. No, but his journey's end is in his mind; that is the great thing that he aims at. So if he meets with com|fortable and plea&s;ant accommodations on the road, at an inn; yet he don't re&s;t there; he entertains no tho'ts of &s;ettling there. He con&s;iders that the&s;e things are not his own, and that he is but a &s;tranger; that, that is not allotted for his home. And when he has re|fre&s;hed him&s;elf, or tarried but for a night, he is for leaving the&s;e accommodations, and going forward, and getting onward towards his journey's end. And the thoughts of coming to his journey's end, are not at all grievious to him. He don't de&s;ire to be travelling al|ways and never come to his journey's end: The thoughts of that would be di&s;couraging to him. But 'tis plea&s;ant to him to think that &s;o much of the way is gone, that he is now nearer home; and that he &s;hall pre&s;ently be there; and the toil and fatigue of his journey will be over.</P>
<P>So &s;hould we thus de&s;ire heaven &s;o much more than the comforts and enjoyments of this life, that we &s;hould long to change the&s;e things for heaven. We &s;hould wait with earne&s;t de&s;ire for the time, when we &s;hall arrive to our journey's end. The apo&s;tle mentions it as an encouraging, comfortable con&s;ideration to chri&s;ti|ans,

when they draw nigh their happine&s;s. "Now is our &s;alvation nearer than when we believed."</P>
<P>Our hearts ought to be loo&s;e to the&s;e things, as it is with a man that is on a journey. However com|fortable enjoyments are, yet we ought to keep our hearts &s;o loo&s;e from them, as chearfully to part with them, whenever God calls.

<P>God hath made us for him&s;elf. "Of God, and thro' God, and to God are all things". Therefore then do we attain to our highe&s;t end, when we are brought to God: But that is by being brought to heaven; for that is God's throne; that is the place of his &s;pecial pre&s;ence, and of his re&s;idence. There is but a very imperfect union with God to be had in this world, a very imper|fect knowledge of God in the mid&s;t of abundance of darkne&s;s; a very imperfect conformity to God, mingled with abundance of enmity and e&s;trangement. Here we can &s;erve and glorify God, but in an exceeding imper|fect manner; our &s;ervice being mingled with much &s;in and di&s;honour to God.</P>
<P>But when we get to heaven, (if ever that be) there we &s;hall be brought to a perfect union with God. There we &s;hall have the clear views of God. We &s;hall &s;ee face to face, and know as we are known. There we &s;hall be fully conformed to God, without any remainder of &s;in. We &s;hall be like him, for we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is. There we &s;hall &s;erve God perfectly. We &s;hall glorify him in an exalted manner, and to the utmo&s;t of the powers and capacity of our nature. Then we &s;hall perfectly give up our&s;elves to God. Then will our hearts be pure and holy offerings to God; offer'd all in a flame of divine love.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="009961_0378_0F7B3CF1FA1A5038">In heaven alone is the attainment of our highe&s;t good. God is the highe&s;t good of the rea&s;onable crea|ture. The enjoyment of him is our proper happi|ne&s;s; and is the only happine&s;s with which our &s;ouls can be &s;atisfied.</P>

<P>Now they have got to heaven, they have got home. They never were at home before. They have got to their father's hou&s;e. They find more comfort a thou|&s;and times, now they are got home, than they did in their journey. While they were on their journey, they underwent much labour and toil. It was a wilderne&s;s that they pa&s;&s;ed through: A difficult road. There were abundance of difficulties in the way; mountains and rough places. It was a laborious, fatigueing thing to travel the road. They were forced to lay out them|&s;elves to get along; and had many weari&s;ome days and nights; but now they have got through; they have got to the place they &s;ought; they are got home; got to their everla&s;ting re&s;t. They need to travel no more; nor labour any more; nor endure any more toil and difficulty; but enjoy perfect re&s;t and peace; and will enjoy them forever. "And I heard a voice from hea|ven, &s;aying unto me, write, ble&s;&s;ed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, &s;aith the &s;pirit, that they may re&s;t from their labours; and their works do follow them". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. 14.13.</NOTE> They don't mourn that they are got home, but greatly rejoice.

<P>We are ready to look upon death as tho' it was a ca|lamity to them: We are ready to mourn over them with tears of pity; to think that tho&s;e that were &s;o dear

Our bowels are ready to yearn over them, and we are ready to look upon it, as tho' &s;ome &s;orrowful thing had befallen them; and as tho' they were in awful circum&s;tances. But this is owing to our infirmity that we are ready thus to look upon it. They are in a happy condition. They are inconceivably ble&s;&s;ed. They don't mourn, but re|joice with exceeding joy. Their mouths are filled with joyful &s;ongs: They drink at rivers of plea&s;ure. They find no mixture of grief at all, that they have changed their earthly hou&s;es and enjoyments, and their earthly friends, and the company of mortal mankind, for hea|ven. They think of it without any degree of regret.</P>
<P>This is an evil world, in compari&s;on of that they are now in. Their life here, if attended with the be&s;t cir|cum&s;tances that any earthly life ever was; was at|tended with abundance that was adver&s;e and afflictive; but now there is an end to all adver&s;ity. "They &s;hall hunger no more, nor thir&s;t any more; neither &s;hall the &s;un light on them, nor any heat.

<P>'Tis true we &s;hall &s;ee them no more while here in this world, yet we ought not immoderately to mourn for that; tho' it u&s;ed to be plea&s;ant to us to &s;ee them; and tho' their company was &s;weet. For we &s;hould con|&s;ider our&s;elves as but on a journey too; we &s;hould be travelling towards the &s;ame place, that they are gone to; and why &s;hould we break our hearts with that, that they are got there before us; when we are follow|ing

after them as fa&s;t as we can; and hope, as &s;oon as ever we get to our journey's end, to be with them again; to be with them in better circum&s;tances than ever we were with them while here? A degree of mourning for near relations when departed, is not incon&s;i&s;tant with chri&s;tianity, but very agreable to it: For as long as we are fle&s;h and blood, no other can be expected, than that we &s;hall have animal propen&s;ities and affections.

This is the employment of every day, with all wicked men; the whole day is &s;pent in it. As &s;oon as ever they awake in the morning, they &s;et out anew towards hell, and &s;pend every waking moment in it. They begin in early days, before they begin to &s;peak. "The wicked are e&s;tranged from the womb, they go a&s;tray as &s;oon as they are born, &s;peaking lies".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 48.4.</NOTE> They hold on in it with per&s;everance. Many of them that live to be old, are never weary in it, if they live to be an hun|dred years old, they will not give out travelling in the way to hell, 'till they arrive there. And all the con|cerns of life are &s;ubordinated to this employment. A wicked man is a &s;ervant of &s;in; his powers and facul|ties are all employed in the &s;ervice of &s;in, and in fiting for hell. And all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are &s;o u&s;ed by him, as to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Some men &s;pend their time in trea&s;uring up wrath again&s;t the day of wrath.

<P>They never 'till then do any thing at that work which their whole lives ought to be &s;pent in; which we have now &s;hewn to be travelling towards heaven.

So far is he from having done his work, that he then only begins to &s;et his face towards heaven. His journey is not fini&s;hed; he is then only fir&s;t brought to be willing to go it, and begins to look that way; &s;o that his care and labour in his chri&s;tian work and bu&s;ine&s;s, is then but begun, which he mu&s;t &s;pend the remaining part of his life in.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e per&s;ons do ill, who when they are converted, and have obtained a hope of their being in a good con|dition, don't &s;trive as earne&s;tly as they did before, while they were under awakenings. They ought henceforward, as long as they live, to be as earne&s;t and laborious as ever; as watchful and careful as ever; yea, they &s;hould increa&s;e more and more. It is no ju&s;t objection or excu&s;e from this, that now they have not the &s;ame to &s;trive for as before; before they &s;trove that they might be conver|ed; but that they have obtained. Is there nothing el&s;e that per&s;ons have as much rea&s;on to &s;trive, and lay out their &s;trength for, as their own &s;afety? Should we not be as willing to be diligent that we may &s;erve &amp; glo|rify God, as that we our&s;elves may be happy? And if

Let it be your daily work, from morning to night, and hold out in it to the end; let there be nothing that &s;hall &s;top or di&s;courage you, or turn you a&s;ide from this road. La|bour to be growing in holine&s;s, to be coming nearer and nearer to heaven, in that you are more and more as you &s;hall be when you get there; (if ever that be). And let all other concerns be &s;ubordinated to this great concern of getting forwards towards heaven. Con&s;ider the rea&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s that have been mentioned why you &s;hould thus &s;pend your life. Con&s;ider that the world is not your abiding place, and was never &s;o intended by God. Con&s;ider how little a while you are to be here, and how little worth your while it is to &s;pend your life to any other purpo&s;e. Con&s;ider that the future world is to be your everla&s;ting abode; and that the enjoyments and concerns of this world, have their being only and en|tirely in order to another world. And con&s;ider further for motive.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>How worthy is heaven that your life &s;hould be wholly &s;pent as a journey towards it.</HI></P>
<P>To what better purpo&s;e can you &s;pend your life, whether you re&s;pect your duty or your intere&s;t? What better end can you propo&s;e to your journey, than to ob|tain heaven? Here you are placed in this world; in this wilderne&s;s, and have your choice given you, that

you may travel which way you plea&s;e. And there is one way that leads to heaven. Now can you direct your cour&s;e better than this way? What can you chu&s;e better for your journey's end? All men have &s;ome aim or other in living. Some mainly &s;eek wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dly things; they &s;pend their days in the pur&s;uit of the&s;e things. But is not heaven, where is fullne&s;s of joy forever and ever, much more worthy to be &s;ought by you? How can you better employ your &s;trength, and u&s;e your means, and &s;pend your days, than in travelling the road that leads to the everla&s;ting enjoyment of God; to his glo|rious pre&s;ence, to the city of the new Jeru&s;alem; to the heavenly mount Zion; where all your de&s;ires will be filled, and no danger of ever loo&s;ing your happine&s;s?</P>
<P>No man is at home in this world, whether he chu&s;e heaven or no; yet here he is but a tran&s;cient per&s;on. Where can you chu&s;e your home better than in hea|ven? The re&s;t and glory of heaven is &s;o great, that 'tis worthy we &s;hould de&s;ire it above riches; above our father's hou&s;es, or our own; above hu&s;band or wife, or children, or all earthly friends. It is worthy that we &s;hould &s;ubordinate the&s;e things to it, and that we &s;hould be ready chearfully to part with them for heaven, when|ever God calls.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This is the way to have death comfortable to us.</HI></P>
<P>If we &s;pend our lives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o as to be only a journeying towards heaven, this will be the way to have death, that is the end of the journey, and entrance into heaven not terrible, but comfortable.</P>

tire&s;ome journey? Is it terrible to him to think that he has almo&s;t got to his journey's end? Are not men rather wont to rejoice at it? Were the children of I&s;rael &s;orry after forty years travel in the wllderne&s;s, when they had almo&s;t got to Canaan? This is the way to have death not terrible when it comes. 'Tis the way to be able to part with the world without grief. Does it grieve the traveller when he has got home, to quit his &s;taff and load of provi&s;ions that he had to &s;u&s;tain him by the way?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>No more of your life will be plea&s;ant to think of when you come to die, than has been &s;pent after this manner.</HI></P>
<P>All of your pa&s;t life that has been &s;pent as a jour|ney towards heaven, will be comfortable to think of on a death bed, and no more. If you have &s;pent none of your life this way, your whole life will be terrible to you to think of, unle&s;s you die under &s;ome great delu&s;ion. You will &s;ee then, how that all of your life that has been &s;pent otherwi&s;e, is lo&s;t. You will then &s;ee the vanity of other aims, that you may have propos'd to your&s;elf. The thought of what you here po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and enjoyed in the world, will not be plea&s;ant to you; un|le&s;s you can think withal that you have &s;ubordinated them to this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Con&s;ider that tho&s;e that are willing thus to &s;pend their lives as a journey towards heaven, may have heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Heaven, as high as it is, and glorious as it is, is at|tainable for &s;uch poor worthle&s;s creatures as we are. We, even &s;uch worms, may attain to have for our home, that glorious region that is the habitation of
<PB N="277" REF="009961_0390_0F7B3CFDFA7F0960">
the glorious angels; yea, the dwelling place of the glo|rious Son of God; and where is the glorious pre&s;ence of the great Jehovah. And we may have it freely; there is no high price that is demanded of us for this priviledge. We may have it without money and with|out price; if we are but willing to &s;et out and go on towards it; are but willing to travel the road that leads to it, and bend our cour&s;e that way as long as we live; we may and &s;hall have heaven for our eternal re&s;ting place.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Let it be con&s;ider'd that if our lives be not a journey towvrds heaven, they will be a journey to hell.</HI></P>
<P>We can't continue here always, but we mu&s;t go &s;ome where el&s;e. All mankind after they have been in this world a little while, they go out of it, and there is but two places that they go to; the two great recepticles of all that depart out of this world; the one is heaven; whether a few, a &s;mall number in compari&s;on, travel: The way that leads hither, is but thinly occupied with travellers. And the other is hell, whether the bulk of mankind do throng. And one or the other of the&s;e mu&s;t be our journey's end; the i&s;&s;ue of our cour&s;e in this world.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude by giving &s;ome directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Labour to get a &s;en&s;e of the vanity of this world;</HI> or the vanity of it on account of the little &s;atisfaction that is to be enjoy'd here; and on account of its &s;hort continuance, and un&s;erviceablene&s;s when we mo&s;t &s;tand in need of help, viz. on a death bed.</P>
<P>All men that live any con&s;iderable time in the world, &s;ee abundance that might convince them of the vanity of the world, if they would but con&s;ider.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="009961_0391_0F7B3CFED02072D0">Be per&s;waded to exerci&s;e con&s;ideration, when you &s;ee and hear from time to time of the death of others. La|bour to turn your thoughts this way. See if you can't &s;ee the vanity of the world in &s;uch a Gla&s;s. If you were &s;en&s;ible how vain a thing this world is, you would &s;ee that it is not worthy that your life &s;hould be &s;pent to the purpo&s;es thereof; and all is lo&s;t that is not &s;ome way aimed at heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Labour to be much acquainted with heaven.</HI></P>
<P>If you are not acquainted with it, you will not be likely to &s;pend your life as a journey thither. You will not be &s;en&s;ible of the worth of it; nor will you long for it. Unle&s;s you are much conver&s;ant in your mind with a better good, it will be exceeding difficult to you to have your hearts loo&s;e from the&s;e things, and to u&s;e them only in &s;ubordination to &s;omething el&s;e, and to be ready to part with them for the &s;ake of that bet|ter good.</P>
<P>Labour therefore to obtain a realizing &s;en&s;e of a hea|venly world, to get a firm belief of the reality of it, and to be very much conver&s;ant with it in your thoughts.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Seek heaven only by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;t tells us that he is the way, and the truth, and the life.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. 14.6.</NOTE> He tells us that he is the door of the &s;heep. "I am the door, by me if any man enter in, he &s;hall be &s;aved; and go in and out and find pa&s;ture". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. 10.9.</NOTE> If we therefore would improve our lives as a journey towards heaven, we mu&s;t &s;eek it by him, and not by our own righteou&s;ne&s;s; as expecting to obtain only for his &s;ake, looking to him, having our dependance on him only for the purcha&s;e of heaven, and procuring it for us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y his
<PB N="279" REF="009961_0392_0F7B3CFF79BCA7A8">
merit. And expect &s;trength to walk in a way of holi|ne&s;s, the way that leads to heaven, only from him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let chri&s;tians help one another in going this journey.</HI></P>
<P>There are many ways that chri&s;tians might greatly help and forward one another in their way to heaven by religious conference, and otherwi&s;e. And per&s;ons great|ly need help in this way, which is, as I have ob&s;erv'd, a difficult way.</P>
<P>Let chri&s;tians be exhorted to go this journey as it were, in company, conver&s;ing together while their jour|ney &s;hall end, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting one another. Company is very de&s;ireable in a journey, but in none &s;o much as in this.</P>
<P>Let chri&s;tians go united, and not fall out by the way, which would be the way to hinder one another; but u&s;e all means they can to help one another up the hill.</P>
<P>This is the way to be more &s;ucce&s;sful in travelling, and to have the more joyful meeting at their father's hou&s;e in glory.</P>
