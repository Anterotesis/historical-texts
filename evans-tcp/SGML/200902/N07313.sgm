<HEAD>A Blow at the Root of the refi|ned Antinomiani&s;m of the pre|&s;ent Age.</HEAD>
<P>_THE next and immediate De&s;ign, of writing on controverted Points, is, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Reader, by holding forth clear Light, to come to a well grounded Judgment, touch|ing the Point in Di&s;pute. And to this End, we &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h between Things that differ, &s;tate the Point in Di&s;pute, with great exactitude; and then pre&s;ent to the Reader, the Arguments on the one &s;ide and the other, of the Que&s;tion in Debate, and leave him to judge for him&s;elf.&mdash;And accord|ingly, in the&s;e Pages, I &s;hall (1.) make &s;ome needful Di&s;tinctions; the not attending to which, has occa&s;ioned no &s;mall Confu&s;ion in this Controver&s;y, about the Na|ture of ju&s;tifying Faith. (2.) State the Que&s;tion now to be di&s;puted, with great exactne&s;s. (3.) Offer Argu|ments again&s;t, and (4.) Con&s;ider their Arguments in Favour of, the Po&s;ition, which contains the Que&s;tion in Di&s;pute. And then leave every Reader to judge for him&s;elf.&mdash;The Di&s;tinctions to be made, are the&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE is an e&s;&s;ential Difference between Ju&s;tifi|cation in the Sight of God, and a per&s;uation in our own Minds, that we are ju&s;tified. One is the Act of God
<PB N="2" REF="009339_0004_103179D2259F7458">
our Judge; the other is the Act of our own Minds; as is &s;elf-evident.&mdash; And God's Act mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be, in order of Nature, at lea&s;t, before our Act. We mu&s;t be ju&s;tified, before we can know that we are ju&s;tified. For a Thing mu&s;t exi&s;t, before its Exi&s;tence can be perceived; to &s;ay otherwi&s;e, is an expre&s;s Contradiction.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE are ju&s;tified by Faith alone, and that whether we know our Faith to be of the right Kind, or not: But we are a&s;&s;ured of our Ju&s;tification, by a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our Faith, and other Chri&s;tian Graces, and by know|ing they are of the right Kind. We are ju&s;tified without Re&s;pect to any Thing in us, or about us, con&s;idered as a recommending Qualification; &s;imply <HI>by free Grace thro' the Redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Our Union with Chri&s;t, is the Foundation of our Intere&s;t in him, his Atonement and Merits; and &s;o of our Title to Pardon, Ju&s;tification and eternal Life, according to the Go&s;pel. Faith alone, is that on our Part, whereby we are united to Chri&s;t and become one with him, and &s;o that alone, by which we are ju&s;tified. A Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in our own Minds, that we have true Faith, and tho&s;e other Chri&s;|tian Graces which are connected with it, and always accompany it, is that alone, by which we can know that we are ju&s;tified. So that while we are ju&s;tified &s;imply on the Account of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, we can know that we are in Fact ju&s;tified meerly by a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our own inherent Graces; even as a poor Woman is made rich &s;imply by her Hu&s;band's E&s;tate, with whom &s;he becomes one in the Eye of the Law by Marriage: but &s;he knows her Title her Hu&s;band's E&s;tate, only as &s;he knows that &s;he was married to him, and actually continues to be his Wife.</P>
<P N="3">3. THERE is an e&s;&s;ential Difference between a full A&s;&s;urance, that tho&s;e, who receive Chri&s;t, and come to God in his Name, &s;hall be pardoned, ju&s;tified and have eternal Life: and a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that I do receive Chri&s;t, and come to God in his Name, and am con&s;e|quently pardoned, ju&s;tified and entitled to eternal Life.&mdash; That tho&s;e who receive Chri&s;t and come to God in his
<PB N="3" REF="009339_0005_103179D5C2B321B0">
Name, &s;hall be pardoned, ju&s;tified, and have eternal Life, is plainly and expre&s;ly revealed in the Go&s;pel, and was true before I was born. And it appears to be true to every one, who under&s;tands the Go&s;pel aright, and believes it with all his Heart. But I mu&s;t actually un|der&s;tand the Go&s;pel, believe it with all my Heart, and in the belief of it actually receive Chri&s;t, and come to God in his Name, before I am ju&s;tified; and &s;o before I can be con&s;cious to my &s;elf that I have &s;o acted, and that con&s;equently I am pardoned, ju&s;tified and entitled to eternal Life.</P>
<P N="4">4. ALTHOUGH Ju&s;tification in the Sight of God, mu&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Nece&s;&s;ity be in order of Nature before our Knowledge that we are ju&s;tified; becau&s;e a Thing mu&s;t exi&s;t be|fore it's Exi&s;tence can be perceived by the Mind: yet it is not impo&s;&s;ible that a ju&s;tified Believer may know his Ju&s;tification &s;oon, from an inward Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his receiving Chri&s;t, and coming to God in his Name, and from a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of all the Chri&s;tian Graces, which are connected with, and do always accompany true Faith. At Conver&s;ion, a Sinner is <HI>brought out of Darkne&s;s into ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ous Light,</HI> and <HI>beholding the Glory of the Lord, is charged into the &s;ame Image;</HI> and will of Cour&s;e therefore in the Time of it, in all ordinary Ca&s;es, at lea&s;t, naturally be con&s;cious of the Change. And the greater the Change is, the more con&s;cious will he be of it. And no Man can prove but that Divine Light may po&s;&s;ibly be imparted in &s;o great a Degree, and the Change be &s;o c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear, that at once it may be known to be a &s;aving Change. I do not &s;ay, that it is always, or that it is ordinarily &s;o, Now-a-Days: but I am willing to grant that it may be &s;o. And from many Expre&s;&s;ions in the new Te&s;tament, I am inclined to think it was common|ly &s;o in the Apo&s;tolic Age. The three Thou&s;and on the Day of Penteco&s;t, not only <HI>received the Word gladly,</HI> but immediately began to &s;pend their Time in <HI>prai&s;ing God,</HI> Act. ii. 41, 47. and Converts in that Age in gene+ral <HI>being ju&s;tified by Faith, had Peace with God,</HI> and <HI>re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in Hope of the Glory of God,</HI> Rom. v. 1, 2. <HI>Whom Loving

<P>AND here, by the Way, this inclines me to entertain charitable Tho'ts of the <HI>fir&s;t Reformers,</HI> that their Hearts might be right, even altho' it could be proved, that they made A&s;&s;urance, of the E&s;&s;ence of Faith; as it is affirm|ed, by &s;ome, that they did. For they were in the heat of Di&s;pute with the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> who denied that A&s;&s;urance was at all attainable in this Life. But good Men among the <HI>fir&s;t Reformers</HI> might be con&s;cious to them&s;elves, that they had had A&s;&s;urance from the very Time of their Conver&s;ion; and might ob&s;erve from the apo&s;tolic Wri|tings, that it u&s;ed to be &s;o with the apo&s;tolic Converts; and might ob&s;erve it to be &s;o with their Converts; and &s;o, thro' want of proper Attention to the Nature of Things, might be led to affirm, that A&s;&s;urance it &s;elf is of the E&s;&s;ence of Ju&s;tifying Faith. And by that one fal&s;e Maxim, be in in&s;en&s;ibly led into many other Mi&s;takes. But <HI>the A&s;&s;embly of Divines at We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> who &s;at about an hundred Years after the Reformation, time having been had mean while to look more carefully into Things, and to di&s;tingui&s;h between Things that differ, le&s;t A&s;&s;u|rance out of their Definition of Ju&s;tifying Faith, in their <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith; Larger,</HI> and <HI>Shorter Catechi&s;ms.</HI> Nay, they even expre&s;ly affirm, in their <HI>Larger Catechi&s;m,</HI> in An&s;wer to <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> 81. "That A&s;&s;urance of Grace and Salvation are not of the E&s;&s;ence of Faith." For while it was affirmed, that A&s;&s;urance was of the E&s;&s;ence of Faith, by the Prote&s;tant Preachers, two Things would con&s;tantly happen, it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, which would tend to convince them, that they were wrong, viz. 1. Many of their &s;eeming Converts, who appeared to be full of the &s;tronge&s;t A&s;&s;urance of the Pardon of their
<PB N="5" REF="009339_0007_103179DD39A23A08">
Sins, would apo&s;tatize and fall away to open Wicked|ne&s;s, before their Eyes: as it has been with many in our Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. And their Adver&s;aries, the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> who hated all A&s;&s;urance of Salvation in general, as the <HI>Arminian</HI> Party do in our Day, would take the Advantage of their Mi&s;take, and make &s;uch Objections again&s;t them, as they could not an&s;wer. Which, when the heat of the Controver&s;y was a little over, and the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Party had had Time impartially to weigh Things, loth as Men naturally are to give up a Point they have once e&s;pou&s;ed, they would feel them&s;elves obliged to do it, in this Ca&s;e.&mdash;And accordingly it came to pa&s;s, within about an hundred Years, that <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Divines in ge|neral gave up that Notion, and defined Faith, in a very different Manner; as we may &s;ee in <HI>the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith</HI> and <HI>Catechi&s;ms</HI> of the <HI>A&s;&s;embly of Divines at We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and yet retained the Doctrine of A&s;&s;urance, and a&s;&s;ert|ed it in the &s;tronge&s;t Language, but not as being of the E&s;&s;ence of Faith, but as re&s;ulting "from the inward E|vidence of tho&s;e Graces, unto which the Promi&s;es are made." And in <HI>New England,</HI> which was &s;ettled about that Time, that Notion has been, from the very fir&s;t Settlement of it, to this Day, univer&s;ally exploded, by all our Divines of Note. Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, I never heard of but one &s;ingle Mini&s;ter, in <HI>New-England,</HI> who appeared in Print to defend that Notion, that A&s;&s;urance is of the E&s;&s;ence of Faith; and he is a Mini&s;ter over a &s;eperate Congregation. And Te&s;timony has been publickly born again&s;t him in Years pa&s;t, by &s;ome of the mo&s;t noted Mini&s;ters in the Country. In <HI>Scotland,</HI> when this Notion was above forty Years ago, advanced and pro|pagated among them, by &s;ome who have &s;ince &s;epera|ted them&s;elves from that Church, it was condemned by the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly of the Church of Scotland,</HI> as being con|trary to the Word of God, to their <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith</HI> and <HI>Catechi&s;ms;</HI> and all their Mini&s;ters were &s;trictly prohibi|ted, under the pain of the Cen&s;ures of that Church, by Writing, Printing, Preaching, Catechi&s;ing, or in any

other Way, to teach this, and the other Doctrines in Connection with it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>the Acts of the general A&s;&s;embly of the Church of Scotland,</HI> 1720, Act V. and 1722, Act VII particularly the&s;e Words, out of a Book intituled, the <HI>Marrow of Modern Divinity,</HI> were expre&s;ly condemned, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>wherefore as <HI>Paul,</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> &s;aid to the Jailor, &s;o &s;ay I unto you, <HI>believe or the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved;</HI> that is, be verily per&s;waded in your Heart, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is your's, and that you &s;hall have Life and Salvation by him, that what&s;oever Chri&s;t did for the Salvation of Mankind, he did it for you &mdash; Fora&s;much as the holy Scripture &s;peak|eth to all in general, none of us ought to di&s;tru&s;t him&s;elf but believe that it doth belong particularly to him&s;elf.</Q> The&s;e Words were expre&s;ly condemned, as making &s;aving Faith con&s;i&s;t in, "a Man's Per&s;wa&s;ion that Chri&s;t is his, died for him," &amp;c.</NOTE> The&s;e Things are not &s;aid, to de|termine what is Truth, by the Names and Influence of fallible Men. To do &s;o, would be to ju&s;tify the whole <HI>popi&s;h</HI> Party, in their appeal to the <HI>Pope,</HI> to decide all Points of Religion; and to give up the fir&s;t Maxim on which the Reformation was built; viz. <HI>That the Word of God is the only Rule of Faith and Manners.</HI> It is not what the <HI>fir&s;t Reformers</HI> &s;aid, nor what <HI>the A&s;&s;embly of Divines</HI> &s;aid, nor what any other Men or Body or Men, &s;ince the Apo&s;tles were dead, have &s;aid, or do &s;ay, that can determine any Doctrine of Religion, or &s;ettle any Point of Controver&s;y about Religion. If they can|not be &s;ettled by the holy Scriptures, they mu&s;t remain for ever undetermin'd in this World. And to be un|willing to appeal to the Bible, and to that alone, to de|termine what is Truth; is a full Proof a Man is a Heart an Infidel. He don't really believe the Bible is the Word of God, nor build his Scheme of Religion upon it; but upon his own Experiences, or the Sayings of others, who&s;e Experiences he imagines were like his own. However what has been &s;aid, may let the Pub|lic &s;ee, how I can con&s;i&s;tently entertain an Opinion, that &s;ome Men's Hearts may be more orthodox than their
<PB N="7" REF="009339_0009_103179E4CEEB03F8">
Heads, in this Matter; which was the Point I was upon. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is very ob&s;ervable, that Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> who is con&s;tantly re|peating it, that all the <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> World are on his &s;ide, and glorying in it, is obliged, in the mid&s;t of it all, to own, that while &s;ome hold, that <HI>A&s;&s;urance is of the E&s;&s;ence of Faith,</HI> others only maintain, that <HI>A&s;&s;urance accompanies it:</HI> (p. 97.) two Things in their Nature e&s;&s;entially different, nay contrary to each other.&mdash; For to &s;ay, that <HI>A&s;&s;urance accompanies Faith,</HI> is to &s;ay, "it is not Faith, but &s;omething el&s;e, which true Believers are wont to have in Company with Faith."</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT while true Converts may, from their fir&s;t Con|ver&s;ion, from a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;aving Change they have pa&s;&s;ed thro', be per&s;waded, that they are in a State of Favour with God, and <HI>Rejoyce in Hope of the Glory of God;</HI> Satan, that great Enemy to all Good, may <HI>trans|form him&s;elf into an Angel of Light,</HI> and delude Hundreds and Thou&s;ands &amp; ten Thou&s;ands (and it is foretold that Satan is to <HI>deceive the Nations</HI> 'till the Thou&s;ands Years of Chri&s;t's Reign do commence, <HI>Rev.</HI> xx. 3.) with a firm Belief that their Sins are forgiven, who never were converted; and &s;o oblige them to believe their Sins are forgiven, when according to the plaine&s;t Declarations of Scripture, they are not forgiven; and &s;o nece&s;&s;itate them in order to vindicate them&s;elves, to a&s;&s;ert, that in ju&s;tifying Faith "we believe that to be true which is not true before we believe it," and that without any Evidence from Scrip|ture, Sen&s;e or Rea&s;on."</P>
<P>And the&s;e fal&s;e Converts, emboldened by the great|ne&s;s of their Number, may ri&s;e, cut out a whole new Scheme of Religion &s;ubver&s;ive of Chri&s;tianity, and &s;eek to propagate it thro' the Chri&s;tian World, &s;hewing the greate&s;t Rancor again&s;t the true Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. Mean while, true Chri&s;tians may get puzled, &s;tumbled and bewildered, and &s;ome perhaps brought unawares to e&s;pou&s;e the Language of the deluded, and to &s;eem to plead their Cau&s;e. And the common Enemies to all experimental Religion, rejoyce in Hopes it will finally appear to all the World, that there is nothing in vital

Piety, and that all Religion con&s;i&s;ts in an external re|gular Behaviour; and it is no matter what Men's Prin|ciples be, if their Lives are but good: which is nothing better than down-right Infidelity.</P>
<P>THIS I take to be the Devil's Grand Scheme, in this pre&s;ent Age; and to counteract this his De&s;ign has been one chief End of all my former Publications: and &s;o now of this.&mdash;But to return, and to proceed to &s;tate the Que&s;tion to be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of my <HI>third Dialogue,</HI> which was on the Nature of <HI>A&s;&s;urance of a Title to eternal Life,</HI> I had &s;aid, that <Q>Sanctification, taking the Word in a large and comprehen&s;ive Sen&s;e, is the Evidence, the only Scripture-evidence, of a good E&s;tate.</Q> And to pre|vent Mi&s;under&s;tanding, I added, <Q>It is u&s;ual for Di|vines to di&s;tingui&s;h between Regeneration and Con|ver&s;ion, between fir&s;t Conver&s;ion &amp; progre&s;&s;ive Sancti|fication, between Divine Views and holy Affections, between Grace in the Heart and an holy Life and Conver&s;ation; but I mean to comprehend all under one general Name. You may call it the <HI>Image of God,</HI> or <HI>Holine&s;s of Heart and Life,</HI> or a real Confor|mity to the Divine Law, and a genuine Compliance with the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. I have already let you &s;ee, what I apprehend to be the Nature of Law and Go&s;pel, of Love to God and Faith in Chri&s;t.&mdash;When I &s;ay, this is the <HI>only Evidence,</HI> I mean, that this is the only Thing wherein <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Sinners,</HI> in every In&s;tance, <HI>differ.</HI> One has the Image of God, the other has not.&mdash;Or to expre&s;s my &s;elf in the Lan|guage of In&s;piration, Joh. xvii. 3. <HI>This is Life eter|nal, to know thee the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI> And 1 Joh. ii. 3, 4, 5. <HI>Hereby we do know that we do know him, if we keep his Commandments. He that &s;aith I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Liar, and the Truth is not in him. But who&s;e keepeth his Word, in him verily is the Love of God perfected: hereby we know that we are in him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to which Words, Mr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> &s;ays, this
<PB N="9" REF="009339_0011_103179E8AAE27848">

For they knew they loved God, and kept his Commands, while the re&s;t of the World lay in Wickedne&s;s. And therefore they &s;aid, 1 Joh. v. 19. <HI>We know that we are of God, and the whole World lieth in Wickedne&s;s.</HI> And will Mr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> affirm, that their A&s;&s;urance was that of the <HI>Phari&s;ees?</HI> Be&s;ides there is a Fallacy in his Words: For the apo&s;to|lical A&s;&s;urance did not ari&s;e meerly from a Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, they differed from others; which might be true, and yet they have no Grace; as was the Ca&s;e with the <HI>Phari&s;ee;</HI> but from a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that their Characters were agreable to the Go&s;pel Standard; that they had tho&s;e Graces which, according to Chri&s;t's holy Religion, are peculiar to the Saints, and certainly connected with eternal Life. Upon this, their A&s;&s;u|rance was built, ju&s;t as I had repre&s;ented. However, if Mr. <HI>Cudworth</HI>'s Words prove nothing el&s;e, yet at lea&s;t they &s;eem to be a &s;ufficient Evidence of his hearty Di&s;|affection to the only &s;criptural A&s;&s;urance of a good E|&s;tate. And he appears to think with his late Friend, that we may as well "place the dome of a Cathedral on the Stalk of a Tulip," as place our A&s;&s;urance on this only &s;criptural Foundation.&mdash;But how then would he have us get A&s;&s;urance? even by believing that our Sins are forgiven, while con&s;cious that we are upon a Level with the wor&s;t of Sinners, no difference between us and them, as dead in Sin, as impenitent and uncon|verted, and as full of Enmity to God.&mdash;And this Belief is to beget our fir&s;t Love.&mdash;But alas, what Grounds have we for this Belief? What Evidence for the Truth of what we believe? why none at all, &s;ays hone&s;t Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> "from Scripture Sen&s;e Rea&s;on."

<P>Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI>'s Words are the&s;e, and the more we think of them, the more remarkable will they appear. <Q>Let it be well ob&s;erved, that the Rea&s;on why we are to a&s;&s;ure our &s;elves in our Faith, that God freely giv|eth Chri&s;t and his Salvation to us in particular, is not becau&s;e it is a Truth before we believe it, but becau&s;e it becometh a certain Truth when we believe it; and becau&s;e it never will be true, except we do in &s;ome Mea&s;ure per&s;uade and a&s;&s;ure our &s;elves that it is &s;o. We have no ab&s;olute Promi&s;e or Declaration in Scrip|ture, that God certainly will or doth give Chri&s;t and his Salvation to any one of us in particular; neither do we know it to be true already by Scripture or Sen&s;e or Rea&s;on, before we a&s;&s;ure our &s;elves ab&s;olutely of it; yea, we are without Chri&s;t's Salvation at pre|&s;ent, in a State of Sin and Mi&s;ery; under the Cur&s;e and Wrath of God. Only&mdash;we are bound by the Command of God, thus to a&s;&s;ure our &s;elves: and the Scripture doth &s;ufficiently warrant us, that we &s;hall not deceive our &s;elves, in <HI>believing a Lie:</HI> but <HI>according to our Faith, &s;o &s;hall it be to us.</HI> Mat. ix. 29. This is a &s;trange Kind of A&s;&s;urance, far different from other ordinary Kinds; and therefore no won|der if it be found weak and imperfect, and difficult to be obtained, and a&s;&s;aulted with many Doubtings. We are con&s;trained to believe other Things on the clear Evidence we have that they are true, and would remain true, whether we believe them or no; &s;o that we cannot deny our A&s;&s;ent, without rebelling again&s;t the Light of our Sen&s;es, Rea&s;on or Con&s;cience. But here our A&s;&s;urance, is not impre&s;&s;ed on our Thoughts by any Evidence of the Thing; but we mu&s;t work

it out in our &s;elves by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of God.</Q> <HI>My&s;tery.</HI> p. 173, 174&mdash;In this plain, hone&s;t Declaration, which opens to clear view the Heart and Soul of their whole Scheme, the&s;e <HI>eight Things</HI> may be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. IN general: That "this is a STRANGE Kind of A&s;|&s;urance, FAR DIFFERENT from other ordinary Kinds." In all other Kinds of A&s;&s;urance, he ob&s;erves, there are the&s;e two Things. (1.) What we believe "is true be|fore we believe it, and whether we believe it or no." (2.) "We are con&s;trained to believe on the clear Evi|dence we have that they are true." But "this is a &s;trange Kind of A&s;&s;urance, far different from other or|dinary Kinds," in the&s;e two Re&s;pects. (1) As we be|lieve "that to be true, which is not true before we be|lieve it; and never would be true, if we did not believe it." (2.) As we believe "without any Evidence of the Thing."&mdash; "Any Evidence from Scripture, Sen&s;e or Rea&s;on."&mdash;Herein the <HI>Strangene&s;s</HI> con&s;i&s;ts, and its Differ|ence from all other Kinds of A&s;&s;urance in the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>A true Convert gets A&s;&s;urance thus.&mdash;The Word of God teaches, <HI>Joh.</HI> i. 12. That he who receives Chri&s;t and believes in his Name, is a Child of God: But I re|ceive Chri&s;t and believe in his Name; therefore I am a Child of God.&mdash;Again, the Word of God teaches, <HI>Acts</HI> iii. 19. That he who repents and is converted &s;hall have his Sins blotted out: But I repent and am con|verted; therefore my Sins are blotted out.&mdash;Once more, the Word of God teaches <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. 31. That he who believes in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall be &s;aved: But I believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chr&s;t; therefore I &s;hall be &s;aved &mdash;This is the "ordinary" Way of getting A&s;&s;urance. And the Things believed are true before we believe them: and we believe only in exact Proportion to our Evidence.</P>
<P>BUT in "this &s;trange Kind of A&s;&s;urance," a Sinner who as yet is impenitent, unconverted, has not received Chri&s;t, nor believed in his Name, but is "under the Wrath and Cur&s;e of God," believes his Sins are for|given;
<PB N="15" REF="009339_0017_103179FB690C6470">
not becau&s;e they are, for they are not; not be|cau&s;e he has Evidence they are, for he has none; but full Evidence to the contrary. But &s;ay they, becau&s;e God has commanded him to believe that they are for|given, and promi&s;ed that if he believes they are forgiven, they &s;hall be forgiven. That is, God has commanded him to believe a Lie and promi&s;ed that if he believes that he, it &s;hall become a Truth. "According to our Faith &s;o &s;hall it be to us"&mdash;Not that that Text in <HI>Mat.</HI> ix. 29. &s;peaks a Word about "this &s;trange Kind of A&s;&s;urance:" For it does not. The Thing the two blind Men be|lieved was true before they believed it: and they were con&s;trained to believe by clear Evidence, <HI>viz.</HI> That Chri&s;t was able to open their Eyes. See ver. 27, 28.&mdash; No. This Kind of A&s;&s;urance is &s;o <HI>&s;trange,</HI> that it is not &s;o much as once required, commanded, exhorted to, or recommended in the Bible: nor any thing like it. Nor indeed is there any Thing like it in the Univer&s;e. For it is in truth "a &s;trange kind ot A&s;&s;urance, <HI>far different</HI> from other ordinary Kinds."&mdash;But to be more particu|lar, and that even tho&s;e who are of the weake&s;t Capa|city, may not only think, but be quite certain, that we do not mi&s;under&s;tand this Author, &s;o very highly cele|brated by Gentlemen of the fir&s;t Rank on that Side of the Que&s;tion, ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE thing to be believed is a &s;uppo&s;ed Fact, which has no Exi&s;tence, viz. "that God freely giveth Chri&s;t and his Salvation to us in particular." Which he &s;ays, "is not true before we believe it." But pray, what does he mean by God's giving Chri&s;t and his Salvation to us in particular?" We often read in the Bible of the <HI>Gift of Chri&s;t,</HI> but every thing taught in the Bible rela|ting to that grand and glorious Affair, is true before we believe, and whether we believe or no. For In|&s;tance, is it not true, whether we believe it or not, that <HI>God &s;o loved the World, as to give his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have ever|la&s;ting Life?</HI> Joh. iii. 16. And are not tho&s;e Words true whether we believe them or not, that <HI>God hath
<PB N="16" REF="009339_0018_103179FEB41A6100">
given to us eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son?</HI> 1 Joh. v. 11. And again, were not tho&s;e Words true, whether the Jews believed them or not, <HI>My Father giveth you the true Bread from Heaven?</HI> Joh. vi. 32. Yes, beyond all Doubt, all the&s;e Things are true, and every &s;ingle Sentiment implied in them is true, has been true above the&s;e Thou&s;and Years, and will remain true, whether we believe them or not. And indeed this is the Ca&s;e with all the Truths contained in the Bible; yea, with every &s;ingle Truth in the Univer&s;e. They are true before we believe them, and whether we believe them or not.</P>
<P>WHAT then does Mr <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> mean by God's giv|ing Chri&s;t and his Salvation to us in particular?" which he &s;ays, "is not true before we believe it. Not <HI>that giving of Chri&s;t</HI> we read of in the Bible: but &s;omething e&s;|&s;entially different. He plainly means <HI>giving us in particular a &s;aving intere&s;t in Chri&s;t and his Salvation:</HI> granting us Pardon, Ju&s;tification and a Title to eternal Life, while impenitent and unconverted. This is plain from what he con&s;iders as oppo&s;ite thereto. <Q>Yea, we are with|out Chri&s;t's Salvation at pre&s;ent, in a &s;tate of Sin and Mi&s;ery, under the Wrath and Cur&s;e of God</Q> Which Words determine his meaning with the utmo&s;t Cer|tainty. So that the Fact to be be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d to be true is this, that we have a <HI>&s;aving</HI> Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, are deli|vered from "the Wrath and Cur&s;e of God," are par|doned and entitled to eternal Life: and indeed this is no more than Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> and all others in his Scheme, hold, that we do believe, in the fir&s;t direct Act of ju&s;ti|fying Faith; and without which they all affirm our Faith is not &s;aying. To be &s;ure Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> affirms this, over and over again, perhaps an Hundred Times, thro' both his Volumes. Particularly p. 145. he defines ju&s;ti|fying Faith in the&s;e Words. "Ju&s;tifying Faith is a be|lieving the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins with &s;pecial Application to a Man's &s;elf &mdash; Now ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="3">3. Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> &s;ays, "this is not true before we believe it." But had it been declared, expre&s;ly or im|plicitly,
<PB N="17" REF="009339_0019_10317A0040D72238">
in the Word of God, it had been true before we believe it, and whether we believe it or not: for this is the Ca&s;e with every Declaration in the Bible. But Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> is &s;o open, frank and hone&s;t, as to own that it is not taught in the Word of God <Q>We have no ab&s;olute Promi&s;e or Declaration in Scripture, that God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oth or will give Chri&s;t and his Salvation to any one of us in particular.&mdash; Yea, we are without Chri&s;t's Salvation at pre&s;ent, under the Wrath of God.</Q> &mdash;Therefore,</P>
<P N="4">4. The thing to be believed to be true, in&s;tead of being true before we believe it, is fal&s;e.

In&s;tead of our having a &s;aving Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, we "are under the Wrath and Cur&s;e of God."&mdash; And therefore this hone&s;t Man, in perfect Con&s;i&s;tence with him&s;elf, declares.</P>

THAT herein lies the great difficulty of believing, not as it is with divine Truths becau&s;e the thing to be believed is contrary to our vicious Bya&s;&s;es; (<HI>Joh.</HI> iii. 19.) but meerly becau&s;e we have no Evidence of it's Truth, but full Demon&s;tration that it is fal&s;e. <Q>This is a &s;trange kind of A&s;&s;urance, far different from other ordinary Kinds; and therefore no wonder if it be found weak and imperfect, and difficult to be obtain|ed, and a&s;&s;aulted with many Doubtings.</Q>&mdash;But pray, wherein does it differ from all other Kinds of A&s;&s;urance? and why is it &s;o difficult to be obtained? He goes on to &s;ay, <Q>we are con&s;trained to believe other things on the clear Evidence that we have that they are true, and would remain true, whether we believe them or no: &s;o that we cannot deny our A&s;&s;ent, with|out rebelling again&s;t the Light of our Sen&s;es, Rea&s;on or Con&s;cience: but here our A&s;&s;urance is not im|pre&s;&s;ed on our Thoughts BY ANY EVIDENCE OF THE THING.</Q>&mdash; And on this Account, and meerly on this Account, is it difficult to believe this Fact. For there is no Man but that would be glad to believe, that in&s;tead of going to Hell after Death, he &s;hall be for ever happy in Heaven. <HI>Balaam</HI> &s;aid, <HI>let me die the Death of the Rightoeus, and let my latter End be like his.</HI> So that wicked Men would be glad to get this Faith;
<PB N="19" REF="009339_0021_10317A04706144E8" MS="y">
and if they cannot get it, it is not becau&s;e they are not <HI>willing</HI> to have it; as was the Ca&s;e with the wicked Jews, whom Chri&s;t upbraided, Joh. v. 40 <HI>Ye WILL NOT come to me that ye might have Life;</HI> but meerly be|cau&s;e they have not "any Evidence of the thing." So then they are not to blame for their Unbelief; for it is no Crime. Rather they are to be pitied; for it can be con&s;idered only as a Calamity. And accordingly &s;everal Writers have of late appeared in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> zealous to prove, that Faith is no Duty, and Unbelief no Sin.</P>
<P>THUS far then Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI>'s Words are plain, and his Meaning ea&s;y to be come at: but the next Parti|cular is not without &s;ome Difficulty. For,</P>
<P N="7">7. HE &s;ays, that the Fact not being true, but rather known to be fal&s;e, and &s;o there being no Evidence of any Kind, or from any Quarter to build our Faith up|on, we mu&s;t therefore <Q>work it out in our &s;elves by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of God.</Q> But how can a Man, in his right Sen&s;es, go about to work up him|&s;elf to believe, that to true, which he knows is not true, but ab&s;olutely fal&s;e? and which Way does a Man go to work in this Ca&s;e? He does not look for Evidence; for he knows there is none from Scripture, Sen&s;e or Rea&s;on. Nay, he does not try to believe it to be true, as &s;uppo&s;ing it true; for he knows it is not true. But he tries to believe it is true, that it may become true, by his believing it to be true. Surprizing, &s;hocking Affair!</P>
<P>AND all this by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of God." &mdash;But pray, how can the Spirit of God grant any A&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;uch a Ca&s;e? Were the Fact true, and were there Evidence of its Truth, we &s;hould need no A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Ca&s;e. A wicked Man is as able and as willing to believe &s;uch a Fact as any Saint in the World. And &s;ince the Fact is known not to be true, and it is known there is no Evidence of its Truth, but full De|mon&s;tration of its Fal&s;hood, what A&s;&s;i&s;tance can the Spi|rit of God grant in the Ca&s;e?

<P>THE Fact believed is that "my Sins are forgiven." or in other Words, "that I have a &s;aving Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t and all the Benefits purcha&s;ed by him."&mdash;Now, if they &s;ay, that this is true before I believe it, they mu&s;t, with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Sort of Antinomians, hold that <HI>we are ju&s;tified before Faith,</HI> in expre&s;s Contradiction to the whole Go&s;pel.&mdash; This they do not, they dare not &s;ay.&mdash;They are therefore under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ay, that we believe that to be true which is not true before we believe it."</P>
<P>BUT if it is not true before we believe it, then every thing Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> has &s;aid will inevitably follow. For if it is not true, it is fal&s;e. If it is not true, there is, there can be, no "Evidence from Scripture, Sen&s;e or Rea&s;on" that it is true. And therefore we mu&s;t believe "without any Evidence of the Thing." And &s;o it is "a &s;trange kind of A&s;&s;urance," and "difficult to be obtained," and we mu&s;t "work it out in our &s;elves." And it being &s;o contrary to common Sen&s;e, even to the Rea&s;on of all Mankind, to believe that to be true which we know is not true, we evidently need the <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tance of</HI> &s;ome <HI>Spirit</HI> in the Affair. Not the Spirit of God in|deed, for he never helps Men to believe any thing, but what is true before we believe it.</P>
<P>IF therefore it can be proved, that this fundamen|tal Maxim is fal&s;e, down goes their whole Scheme, and all who are &s;etted upon it, he buried in its Ruins.&mdash;</P>

To &s;ay otherwi&s;e, is an expre&s;s Contradiction. For, to di&s;cern that a Thing exi&s;ts before it does exi&s;t, is to &s;ee that it is before it is: Which is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, that a Thing may be, and not be, at the &s;ame Time.

<P>BUT to believe <HI>my Sins are forgiven,</HI> is to di&s;cern that this Fact is really &s;o, that this Thing does exi&s;t.

<P N="3">3. IN order to make this Text &s;erve the Purpo&s;e of &s;upporting their Scheme, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood thus. <Q>O chri&s;tle&s;s, impenitent, unconverted Sinner, who art in an unpardoned State, under the Wrath and Cur&s;e of God, impenitent as thou art, believe thy Sins are forgiven, and they &s;hall be forgiven. I do not &s;ay as <HI>Peter</HI> did, <HI>repent and be converted, that thy Sins may be blotted out.</HI> But I &s;ay, impenitent as thou art, and certain as thou art, of thine impenitency, without any Evidence of the Thing, from Scripture, Sen&s;e or Rea|&s;on, believe thy Sins are blotted out, and it &s;hall be unto thee according to thy Faith. For altho' it is not true before thou believe&s;t it, in believing it to be true, it &s;hall become true. Believe therefore thy Sins are forgiven, and they &s;hall be forgiven.</Q> &mdash; This is the Spirit and Soul of that evangelical Preaching in fa&s;hion with the&s;e Men. See p. 102, 123, 175, &amp;c &mdash; But neither that Text in <HI>Mark,</HI> nor any other in the Bible gives the lea&s;t Countenance to their Scheme.</P>
<P>THUS we have taken a View of the Arguments,
<PB N="45" REF="009339_0047_10317A547287E9C0">
which Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> u&s;es, to prove, that in ju&s;tifying Faith "we believe that to be true, which is not true before we believe it."&mdash;And thus we have fini&s;hed what was at fir&s;t propo&s;ed. And his Scheme, in contra&s;t with that of the gro&s;s <HI>Antin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mians,</HI> &s;tands thus,</P>
<P>GROSS <HI>Antin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">miani&s;m,</HI> and refined <HI>Antin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">miani&s;m,</HI> agree in a&s;&s;erting, that in ju&s;tifying Faith we believe that our Sins are forgiven, and that God is reconciled to us.</P>
<P>GROSS <HI>Antin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mians,</HI> a&s;&s;ert, (1.) That the Erect are ju&s;tified before Faith. (2.) That their Ju&s;tification is manife&s;ted to them by the Spirit of God. (3.) In Con|&s;equence of which they believe they are ju&s;tified. (4.) This Belief pacifies their Con&s;ciences, and is the Source of every religious Affection.</P>
<P>REFINED <HI>Antin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mians,</HI> a&s;&s;ert, (1.) That before Faith the Elect, as well as others, are under the Wrath of God and Cur&s;e of the Law. (2) That yet in Faith they believe God loves them, and they are delivered from the Cur&s;e of the Law. (3.) And becau&s;e this is not true before it is believed, therefore they believe it without any Evidence of the Thing.

<P>IF the Elect are not ju&s;tified before Faith, the gro&s;s <HI>Antin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mian</HI> Scheme is fundamentally fal&s;e. &mdash; And,</P>
<P>IF in ju&s;tifying Faith, we are not to believe that to be true, which is not true before we believe it, the re|fined <HI>Antin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mian</HI> Scheme is al&s;o fundamentally fal&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Fact believed on both Schemes is the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> that an impenitent, unconverted, chri&s;tle&s;s Sinner is ju&s;ti|fied. And a Belief of this Fact, on both Schemes, pro|duces the &s;ame Effects, <HI>viz.</HI> pacifies the Con&s;cience, and is the Source of all their Religion. And both Schemes grant that this Fact is not revealed in the Bible. But one vindicates his Belief by &s;aying, the Elect are ju&s;ti|fied before Faith, and have their Ju&s;tification immedi|ately revealed to them by the Spirit of God. And the other by &s;aying, we are commanded by God, to believe that to be true, which is not true before we believe it, and to believe without any Evidence of the Thing, and

God &s;tands obliged that our Faith &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be di&s;ap|pointed.</P>
<P>WE have heard how the celebrated Mr <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> ex|plains his Scheme; and we have con&s;idered what Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> has to offer in its Defence. And the Controver|&s;y is brought into a narrow Compa&s;s, to one &s;ingle Point. <HI>viz.</HI> whether in ju&s;tifying Faith we believe that to be true, which is not true before we believe it. And it is brought down out of the Clouds, and made plain and ea&s;y to the weake&s;t Capacity, and every one is freely left to judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IF after all any poor bewildered Sinner is &s;till at a lo&s;s, let him take his Bible in his Hand, enter into his Clo&s;et, fall on his Knees, look up to God who has given him the Bible to be the only Rule of his Faith, and &s;ay, <Q>O Lord, thou ha&s;t given me thy holy Word to be the only Rule of my Faith; and is it &s;afe, great God, for me to venture my Soul for Eternity in the Belief of that, which, all acknowledge, is not reveal|ed in thy holy Word? If every Truth contained in that &s;acred Book, all which are true before they are believed, join to declare me an unpardoned Sinner; O leave me not to quiet my Con&s;cience by the Belief of that which is not revealed there! O &s;uffer me not to fly from the unerring Word of my final Judge, and take Refuge in a Lie! Rather let me have no Peace, than a fal&s;e Peace!
