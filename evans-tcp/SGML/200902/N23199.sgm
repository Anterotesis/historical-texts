<P>Permit me to indulge the plea&s;ing hope, that when I a&s;&s;ert my mind is deeply impre&s;&s;ed with

<P>Should the in&s;ignificance of <HI>my</HI> life induce any per&s;on better qualified to pre&s;ent the world with <HI>his,</HI> big with intere&s;ting events, my di&s;po&s;ing of &s;everal large editions of that performance will afford me more <HI>&s;olid</HI> &s;atisfaction as a <HI>book&s;eller,</HI> than any &s;ucce&s;s or emolument which can po&s;&s;i|bly ari&s;e from this, my fir&s;t, and mo&s;t probably la&s;t, e&s;&s;ay as an <HI>author.</HI></P>
<P>If unfortunately any of my kind readers &s;hould find the book &s;o <HI>horrid dull</HI> and <HI>&s;tupid,</HI> that they cannot get through it, or if they do, and wi&s;h not to travel the &s;ame road again, I here declare my

<P>Should my memoirs be attended with no other benefit to &s;ociety, they will at lea&s;t tend to &s;hew what may be effected by a per&s;evering habit of indu&s;try, and in upright con&s;cientious demeanour in trade towards the public, and probably in&s;pire &s;ome one, of perhaps &s;uperior abilities, with a laudable ambition, to emerge from ob&s;curity, by a proper application of tho&s;e talents with which Providence has favoured him, to his own credit and emolument, as well as the benefit of the community. To &s;uch an one I ever have, and ever &s;hall wi&s;h every po&s;&s;ible &s;ucce&s;s, as it has uniformly been my opinion, that whatever is thus acquired, is more honourable to the parties than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth obtained without any intrin&s;ic merit or exertion, and which is too frequently con&s;umed with rapidity in the pur&s;uit of vice and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>One word to my old <HI>friends</HI> the book&s;ellers under <HI>number three</HI> of my dedication. This pub|lication it is to be expected will tend to excite &s;ome degree of mirth in them. Con&s;cious that I have often been the cau&s;e (however unintentional on my part) of exciting le&s;s plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations in them, I will readily allow them full &s;cope; however, according to the well known adage,
<PB N="viii" REF="030668_0007_0FE8568E87E8B658">"Let them laugh who win," I hope they will indulge me in the &s;ome propen&s;ity of laughing, if not <HI>at</HI> them, at lea&s;t <HI>with</HI> them.</P>
<P>As a proof of my friendly di&s;po&s;ition, I &s;hall here add a piece of advice, which I do not he&s;i|tate to pronounce will, if attended to, entitle them to promotion in my <HI>fir&s;t</HI> cla&s;s of book&s;el|bers, and eventually prove more beneficial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nn a con&s;tant per&s;everance in the mode of conduct they have nitherto pur&s;ued; and tho&s;e who have children will, I hope, &s;ee the propriety of incul|cating the &s;ame doctrine to them for their future benefit; and as I &s;ratter my&s;elt my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atwice will prove equally productive of benefit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> year num|bers of the community at large, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ellers. It is this:
If they ob&s;erve any per&s;on by indu&s;try and application endeavouring to obtain an hone&s;t livelihood in that line for which his talents or di&s;po&s;ition have qualified him, never to attempt, by dark inuendoes, &s;ly hints, and fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ions, to injure him, as, if he happens to be a man of a becoming &s;pirit, &s;uch conduct will only tend to increa&s;e his exertions, and render him &s;till more cautions to obtain a good character; in &s;o doing their weapons will recoil on them&s;elves, and they will have the mortification to &s;ee him flouri&s;h, whil&s;t they become objects of contempt in the eyes of the public, and will of cour&s;e be avoided by them.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>THAT I might not be ju&s;tly charged with ingratitude, I take this opportunity of thanking my friends, cu&s;tomers, and the public, for their candid reception of my volume; the &s;ale of which, and the encomiums I have received on the &s;ubject, both by letter and otherwi&s;e, have far exceeded my mo&s;t &s;anguine and &s;elf-flattering expectations.</P>
<P>But, left I &s;hould be over vain, I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time declare, that I have received &s;currilous abu&s;ive letters from &s;everal of Mr. We&s;ley's peo|ple, merely becau&s;e I have expo&s;ed their ridicu|lous principles and ab&s;urd practices; but more particularly, for having pulled off the hypocriti|cal veil from &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;anctified deceivers which are among them.</P>
<P>The numerous letters of approbation which I have received from rational intelligent gentle|men, convinces me that I have not wronged the cau&s;e of manly and rational chri&s;tianity, nor was it ever my intention &s;o to do.</P>
<P>I here al&s;o pre&s;ent my compliments and &s;in|cere thanks to my impartial friends, under the &s;econd cla&s;s of my dedication, for the friendly di&s;po&s;ition they have &s;hews, in freely di&s;tributing my Memoirs among their cu&s;tomers and they may be a&s;&s;ured, that I will not let &s;lip any op|portunity of making them proper returns for all their favours.</P>

<P>YOU have often re|que&s;ted me to devote what few lei&s;ure mo|ments I could &s;pare, in minuting down &s;ome of the principal occurrences of my life, with a view, &s;ooner or later, of exhibiting the account to the public eye; who, as you were plea&s;ed to &s;ay, could not but be &s;omewhat curious to learn &s;ome well au|thenticated particulars of a man, well known to have ri&s;en from an ob&s;cure origin to a degree of notice, and to a participation of the favor of the Public, in a particular line of bu&s;ine&s;s, I may without vanity &s;ay, hi|therto unprecedented.

Ever willing to pay a becoming defer|ence to the judgment of a per&s;on of your acknowledged merits, and whom I have the felicity of numbering among my firme&s;t friends. yet being le&s;s anxious to appear as an adventurer among the numerous tribe of authors, than to continue a con&s;iderable vender of the produce of their labours, I have continually delayed complying with your kind wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>I &s;hould probably have &s;till delayed compil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng my narrative, if the editors of a certain periodical publication, who month|ly labour to be witty, had not deemed me of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to introduce into their work, what they are plea&s;ed to call a <HI>Portrait</HI> of me! and though it was by them intended as a caricatura, yet I am per&s;uaded it will appear to tho&s;e who be&s;t know me, as a daubing more characteri&s;tic of the hea|vy bru&s;h of a manufacturer of &s;igns, than the delicate pencil of a true portrait-paint|er; and on that account I &s;hould mo&s;t certainly have con&s;idered it as unworthy notice, had they not daubed me with fal&s;e features.

<P>But to begin&mdash; Were I inclined to pride my&s;elf in genea|logical de&s;cent, I might here boa&s;t that the family were originally &s;ettled at White Lackington, in Somer&s;et&s;hire, which ob|tained its name from one of my famous ance&s;tors, and give you a long detail of their grandeur, &amp;c. but having as little lei&s;ure as inclination to boa&s;t of what if true would add nothing to <HI>my</HI> merits, I &s;hall for the prefent only &s;ay. that I was born at Wel|lington in Somer&s;et&s;hire, on the 31&s;t of Augu&s;t, (old &s;tyle) 1746. My father George I ackington was a Journcyman Shoemaker, who had incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of my grandfather for marrying my mother, who&s;e maiden name was Joan Trott. She was the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ughter of a poor weaver in Wellington; a good hone&s;t man, who&s;e end was remark|able,
<PB N="19" REF="030668_0017_0FE856B4F68BF570">though not very fortunate; in the road between Taunton and Wellington he was found drowned in a ditch where the water &s;carcely covered his face: He was, 'tis conjectured,</P>
<L>"&mdash;Drunk when he died."</L>
<P>This happened &s;ome years before the mar|riage of my Father and Mother.</P>
<P>My grandfather George Lackington had been a Gentleman Farmer at Langford, a village two miles from Wellington, and acquired a pretty confiderable proper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y.&mdash; But my father's mother dying when my father was but about thirteen years of age, my grandfather who had two daughters, bound my father apprentice to a Mr. Hord|ly, a ma&s;ter &s;hoemaker in Wellington, with an intention of &s;etting him up in that bu&s;ine&s;s at the expiration of his time. But my father worked a year or two as a journeyman and, then di&s;plea&s;ed his father by marrying a woman without a &s;hilling, of a mean family and who &s;upported her&s;elf by &s;pinning of wool into yarn, &s;o that my mother was de|livered of your friend and humble &s;ervant, her fir&s;t-born, and hope of the family, in my grandmother Trott's poor cottage; and that good old woman carried me privately to church unknewn to my father who was

<P>About the year 1750 my father having three or four children, and my mother prov|ing an excellent wife, my grandfather's re&s;entment had nearly &s;ub&s;ided, &s;o that he &s;upplied him with money to open a &s;hop for <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> But that which was intended to be of very great &s;ervice to him and his family, eventually proved extremely unfortunate to him&s;elf and them: for as &s;oon as he found he was more at ea&s;e in his circurn&s;tances, he contracted a fatal habit of drinking, and of cour&s;e his bu&s;ine&s;s was neglected; &s;o that after &s;everal fruitle&s;s attempts of my grand|father to keep him in trade, he was, partly by a very large family but more by his habitual drunkenne&s;s, reduced to his old &s;tate of a journeyman &s;hoemaker: Yet &s;o infatuated was he with the love of liquor, that the endearing ties of hu&s;band and father could not re&s;train him; by which baneful habit him&s;elf and family were involved in the extreme&s;t poverty.</P>

<P>I Mu&s;t not forget an odd adventure that happened when I was about twelve years of age.</P>
<P>I had one day walked with my father to Holywell lake, a village two miles from Wellington, where meeting with &s;ome good ale, he could not &s;ind in his heart to part from it until lato at night. When we were returning home by the way of Rock-well-Green, (commonly called <HI>Regue-Green</HI> from a gang of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">obbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and hou&s;e|breakers who formerly lived there) having
<PB N="26" REF="030668_0024_0FE856DA9C4C4B10">ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed the bridge, we were met by &s;ev|eral men and women, who appeared to be very much frightened, being in great agita|tion. They informed us that they were re|turning back to Rogue-Green, in order to &s;leep there that night, having been prevented from going home to Wellington by a dread|ful Apparition, which they had all &s;een in the hollow way, about a quarter of a mile di&s;tant; adding, that a per&s;on having been murdered there formerly, the gho&s;t had walked ever &s;ince; that they had never before paid much attention to the well|known report; but now they were obliged to crediti, having had ocular demon&s;tration. My father had drank too large a quantity of ale to be much afraid of any thing, and I (who could not let &s;lip &s;uch an opportunity of &s;hewing my courage) &s;econded matters for the poor terrified people to return with is; and as I offered to lead the van, they were prevailed on to make the attempt once nore; but &s;aid, that it was rather pre&s;ump|tuous, and hoped that no dreadful confe|quence would en&s;ue, as all the company, they tru&s;ted, were hone&s;t-hearted, and in|tended no harm to any per&s;on; they more|over added, that "God certainly was above the Devil." I then advanced, and kept be|before the company about fifty yards,</P>
<L><PB N="27" REF="030668_0025_0FE856DC26E7ABC8">
"Whi&s;tling aloud to bear my courage up."</L>
<P>But when we had walked about a quarte of a mile, I &s;aw at &s;ome di&s;tance before u in the hedge, the dreadful apparition that had &s;o terrified our company. Here it is! (&s;aid I "Lord have mercy upon us!" replied &s;ome of me company, making a full &s;top; and woold have gone back, but &s;hame prevent|ed them. I &s;till kept my di&s;tance before, and called out to them to follow me, a&s;&s;u|ring them that I was determined to fee what it was. They then fell one behind another, and advanced in &s;ingle files. As I pro|ceeded I too was &s;eized with a timid appre|hen&s;ion, but dur&s;t not own it; &s;till heeping on before, although I perceived my hair to heave my hat from my head, and my teeth to chatter in my mouth. In fact I was greatly agitated at what I &s;aw; the object much re&s;embled the human figure as to &s;hape but the &s;ize was prodigious. How|ever I had promi&s;ed to &s;ee what it was, and for that purpo&s;e I ob&s;tinately ventured on about thirty yards from the place, where I fir&s;t had &s;ight of it. I then perceived that it was only a very &s;hort tree, who&s;e limbs had been newly cut off, the doing of which had made it much re&s;emble a giant. I then called to the company, and informed them
<PB N="28" REF="030668_0026_0FE856E36C2671C8">with a hearty laugh, that they had been frightened at the &s;tump of a tree.</P>
<P>This &s;tory cau&s;ed excellent diver&s;ion for a long time afterwards in Wellington, and I was mentioned as an hero.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction I received from the di&s;covery, and the honour I ac|quired for the courage I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in making it, has, I believe, had much influence on me ever after; as I cannot recollect that in any one in&s;tance I have ever ob&s;erved the leaft fear of apparitions, &s;pirits, &amp;c. &s;ince.</P>

<P>While I am on this &s;ubject, I cannot re|&s;i&s;t the temptation of relating a truly ridi|culous affair that happened about this time at Taunton.</P>
<P>In the workhou&s;e belonging to the pari&s;h of St. James, there lived a young woman who was an idiot. This poor creature had a gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> aver&s;ion to &s;leeping in a bed, and at bed-time would often run away to a field in the neighbourhood, called the Priory, where &s;he &s;lept in the cow&s;heds.</P>
<P>In order to break her of this bad cu&s;tom, two men agreed to try if they could not frighten her out of it. And one night, when
<PB N="29" REF="030668_0027_0FE856E4F97A66B8">they knew that &s;he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> took a white &s;heet with them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to the place, one of the men concealed him&s;elf to &s;ee the event while the other wrapped him&s;elf up in the &s;heet, and walked back|wards and forwards clo&s;e before the cow&s;hed in which &s;he lay. It was &s;ome time before Molly paid any attention to the apparition; but at la&s;t up &s;he got. "Aha! (&s;aid &s;he) a white devil!" and by her manner of expre&s;|&s;ing her&s;elf &s;he thought it was very &s;trange to &s;ee a <HI>white</HI> devil. And &s;oon after &s;he exclaimed, "A black devil, too! a black devil, too!" With that the man who had the &s;heet on, looked over his &s;houlder, and &s;aw (or imagined he &s;aw) a per&s;on all over black behind him; the &s;ight of which made him take to his heels. Molly then clapped her hands as fa&s;t as &s;he could, crying out at the &s;ame time, "Run, black devil, and catch white devil! Run, black devil, and catch white devil!" and was highly divert|ed. But this proved a &s;erious adventure to the white devil, as he expired within a few minutes after he had reached his own hou&s;e; and from that time poor Molly was left alone to &s;leep in peace.</P>
<P>About ten years after the above affair, at Wivel&s;combe, nine miles from Taunton, a
<PB N="30" REF="030668_0028_0FE856ECA9CE35A0">gentleman farmer's hou&s;e was alarmed every night between twelve and one o'clock. The chamber doors were thrown open, the bed|clothes pulled off the beds, and the kitchen furniture thrown with violence about the kitchen, to the great terror of the family, in&s;omuch that the &s;ervants gave their ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s warning to leave their places, and &s;ome of them actually quitted their &s;er|vice. This dreadful affair had la&s;ted about &s;ix weeks, when a young gentleman who was there on a vi&s;it, being in bed one night, at the u&s;ual hour he heard his cham|ber door thrown open, and a very odd noi&s;e about his room. He was at fir&s;t frightened; but the noi&s;e continuing a long time, he became calm, and laid &s;till, revolving in his mind what he had be&s;t do. When on a &s;udden he heard the &s;pirit creep under his bed, which was immediately lifted up, &amp;c. This convinced him that there was &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance in the &s;pirit; on which he leaped cut of bed, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cared the door, and with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ken &s;taff belaboured the gho&s;t under the bed as hard as he could, until he heard a female voice imploring mercy. On that he opened his chamber door, and called aloud for a light. The family all got up as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and came to his room. He then informed them that he had got the &s;pirit
<PB N="31" REF="030668_0029_0FE856EE37DA3BA8">under the bed; on hearing which, mo&s;t of them were terribly frightened, and would have run off fa&s;ter than they came, but he a&s;&s;ured them, they had nothing to fear; then out he dragged the half-murdered &s;pi|rit from its &s;cene of action. But how great was their &s;urpri&s;e and &s;hame, when they di&s;covered that this tormenting devil was no other than one of their &s;ervant girls about &s;ixteen years of age, who had been confined to her bed &s;everal months by illne&s;s.</P>
<P>This gho&s;t was no &s;ooner laid, than two others alarmed the neighbourhood; one of which for a long time &s;hook a hou&s;e every night, and terribly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the family; at length they all re&s;olved one night to go over the whole hou&s;e in a body, and &s;ee what it was that &s;o agitated the building. They ex|amined every room, but in vain, as no cau&s;e could be di&s;covered. So they very &s;eriou&s;ly as well as unanimou&s;ly concluded, that it mu&s;t be <HI>the devil.</HI></P>
<P>But about a fortnight after this, one of the family being out late in the garden, &s;aw a great boy get in at the window of an old hou&s;e next door (part of which was in ruins), and &s;oon after the hou&s;e began to &s;hake as u&s;ual, on which the family went out of their own habitation, and entered the old hou&s;e where the boy was &s;een to get in; yet for a
<PB N="32" REF="030668_0030_0FE856F5B3D948F0">long time they could not di&s;cover any per|&s;on, and were ju&s;t turning to come out again, when one of the company ob&s;erved the boy &s;u&s;pended above their heads, &s;triding over the end of a large beam that ran acro&s;s both hou&s;es.</P>
<P>It was then apparent that the violent agi|tation of the adjoining hou&s;e was occa&s;ioned by nothing more than his leaping up and down on the un&s;upported end of this beam.</P>
<P>Another apparition had for a long time &s;tolen many gee&s;e, turkeys, &amp;c. and altho' it had been &s;een by many, yet nobody would venture to go near it, until at length one per&s;on a little wi&s;er than the re&s;t of his neighbours, &s;eeing the famous apparition all over white &s;tealing his fowls, was determined to be fully &s;atisfied what kind of &s;pirit it could be that had &s;o great a predilection for poultry. He accordingly went round the yard, and as the apparition was coming over the wall, he knocked it down. This ter|rible gho&s;t then proved to be a neighbouring woman, who had put on her &s;hroud in order to deter any per&s;ons &s;hould they by chance &s;ee her, from coming near her.&mdash;. Thus, though &s;he had for a long time &s;uc|ce&s;sfully practi&s;ed this ingenious way of procuring poultry, the old fox was caught at la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="030668_0031_0FE856F7485CD2C8">
This is &s;o prolific a &s;ubject, that I could fill many pages with relations of dreadful &s;pectres, which for a while have reigned with tyrannic &s;way over weak minds, and at length when calm Rea&s;on was &s;uffered to a&s;&s;ume its power, have been di&s;covered to be no more objects of terror than tho&s;e I have here noticed. But doubtle&s;s many &s;uch in&s;tances mu&s;t have occurred to you.</P>
<P>It has indeed often a&s;toni&s;hed me, that in this enlightened age there &s;hould yet re|main numbers, not in the country only, but even in the metropolis, who &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be made mi&s;erable by vain fears of pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ernatural occurrences, which generally owe their origin to the knavery of &s;ome ill|di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed per&s;on, who has a &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;e to an&s;wer thereby, or to the fooli&s;h de&s;ire of alarming the minds of weak people; a practice &s;ometimes (though intended as <HI>fun</HI>) productive of very &s;erious con&s;equences. Now and then, indeed, the&s;e terrors are owing to accidental and ridiculous cau&s;es. As an in&s;tance, I &s;hall give you an account of a terrible alarm which &s;ome years &s;ince took place in an Ho&s;pital of this city, as related to me by a gentleman, who at the time re&s;i|ded in the hou&s;e, for the purpo&s;e of com|pleting his medical education, and on who&s;e veracity I can confidently rely.</P>

<P>A CAT&mdash;An odd beginning of a Letter. by the bye&mdash;but here highly <HI>important</HI> and proper, as tend|ing to relieve you from the anxious thoughts which, (no doubt) mu&s;t have filled your mind on the &s;ubject of the concluding part of my former letter. I mu&s;t give you one laughable in&s;tance more, which lately h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p|pened. Mr. Higley, the book&s;eller famous for &s;elling odd volumes or broken &s;ets of books, lived next door to a public-hou&s;e in Ru&s;&s;ell-court, Drury-lane; this public-hou&s;e was &s;eparated from his habitation only by a &s;light wain&s;cot partition, through which Mr. Higley cau&s;ed an hole to be cut and a &s;li|der put over it, &s;o that when he wanted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> beer, he always drew back the &s;lider and had it handed to him through this conveni|ent aperture.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT the time that I was bound apprentice, my ma&s;ter had two &s;ons, the elde&s;t about &s;eventeen years old, the younge&s;t fourteen. The elde&s;t had ju&s;t been baptized, and introduced as a member of the ariani&s;tical dipping community where my ma&s;ter and his family attended. The boy was a very &s;ober indu&s;trious youth, and gave his father and mother much plea&s;ure. The younge&s;t was al&s;o a good lad. Thus every thing continued well for &s;ome time a&s;ter I had been added to the family. Both of the boys had very good natural parts, and
<PB N="41" REF="030668_0039_0FE8571ACADFAD18">had learned to read, write, keep accounts, &amp;c. But they had been at &s;chools where no va|riety of books had been introduced, &s;o that all they had read was the Bible. My ma&s;ter's whole library con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ted of a &s;chool-&s;ize Bible, Watts's P&s;alms and Hymns, Foot's Tract on Bapti&s;m, Culpepper's Herbal, the Hi&s;tory of the Gentle Gra&s;t, an old imperiect volume of Receipts in Phy&s;ic, Surgery, &amp;c. and the Ready Reckoner. The ideas of the family were as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ribed as their library. My ma&s;ter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttention to bu&s;ine&s;s and work|ing hard, <HI>"minding the main chance."</HI> On Sunday <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> went to meeting; my ma&s;ter on that day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hort grace before dinner, and the boys read a &s;ew chapters in the Bible took a walk for an hour or two, then read a chapter or two more.</P>
<L>"What right, what trao, what fit we ju&s;tly call,</L>
<L>"And this was all our care&mdash;for this is all."</L>
<P>We then &s;upped, and went early to bed, perfectly &s;atisfied with having done our duty; and each having a quiet con&s;cience, &s;oon &s;ell into the arms of
"Nature's &s;on nur&s;e! &s;wee &s;teep."</P>
<P>I cannot here omit mentioning a very &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of my ma&s;ter's: Every moning at all &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ons of the year, and in
<PB N="42" REF="030668_0040_0FE85722759A07D8">all weathers, he ro&s;e about three o'clock, took a walk by the river-&s;ide round French|ware-&s;ields, &s;topt at an alehou&s;e that was early open to drink half a pint of ale, came back before &s;ix o'clock, then called up his people to work, and went to bed again about &s;even.</P>
<P>Thus was the good man's family jogging ea&s;ily and quietly on, no one doubting but he &s;hould go to heaven when he died, and every one hoping it would be a good while fir&s;t.</P>
<P>"A man &s;hould be religious, not &s;uper&s;titious."</P>
<P>But alas! the dreadful cri&s;is was at hand that put an end to the happine&s;s and peace of this little family. I had been an appren|tice about twelve or fifteen months, when my ma&s;ter's elde&s;t &s;on George happened to go and hear a &s;ermon by one of Mr. We&s;|ley's preachers, who had left the plough-tail to preach the <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>unadulterated</HI> Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. Ey this &s;ermon the fallow ground of poor George's heart was ploughed up, he was now per&s;uaded that the innocent and good life he had led would only &s;ink him deeper into hell: in &s;hort he found out that he had never been converted, and of cour&s;e was in a &s;tate of damnation, without benefit of Clergy. But he did not long continue in
<PB N="43" REF="030668_0041_0FE8572407DBD740">this damnable &s;tate, but &s;oon became one of

<P>George had no &s;ooner made things &s;ure for him&s;elf, than he began to extend his con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n to his father, mother, brother, and me; and very kindly gave us to under&s;tand, that he was &s;ure we were in a very deplorable &s;tate, "without hope, and without God in the world," being under the cur&s;e of the Law. In the long winter nights, as we &s;at at work together, he proved (in his way) that every man had original &s;in enough to damn a thou&s;and &s;ouls; and a deal was &s;aid on that &s;ubject: Quotations were made from &s;ome <HI>deep</HI> author who had a&s;&s;erted, that there were "infants in hell but a &s;pan long;" and that "hell was paved with infant &s;culls," &amp;c. As to Morality, George a&s;&s;ured us it
<PB N="44" REF="030668_0042_0FE8572B8C83ACA0">was of no avail; that as for good works, they were only &s;plendid &s;ins; and that in the be&s;t good work that any creature could per|form, there was &s;in enough to &s;ink the doer to the nethermo&s;t hell, that it was <HI>faith</HI> alone that did every thing, without a grain of morality; but that no man could have one particle of this my&s;terious faith, before he was juftified; and that <HI>ju&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ication</HI> was a &s;udden operation on the &s;oul, by which the mo&s;t execrable wretch that ever lived might in&s;tantaneou&s;ly be a&s;&s;ured of all his &s;ins be|ing pardoned; that his body <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that very moment became the living temple of the Holy Gho&s;t; that he had fellow&s;hip with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; and that Spirit was to be their con&s;tant and infallible guide.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter very &s;eldom heard any of the&s;e conver&s;ations, but my good mi&s;tre&s;s would &s;it down for hours together, with her Bible in her lap, from which &s;he would read &s;uch &s;criptures as proved the nece&s;&s;ity of living a good life, performing good works, &amp;c. &s;he al&s;o did her be&s;t to con&s;ute the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ts of Original &s;in.

<P>The&s;e devil-dodgers happened to be &s;o very <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ful</HI> (that is very <HI>noi&s;y</HI>) that they &s;oon &s;ent John home, crying out, he &s;hould be damned! he &s;hould be damned forever!</P>
<P>But John &s;oon got out of the damnable &s;tate, and a&s;&s;ured us that all his &s;ins were forgiven, merely by believing that he had pa&s;&s;ed from death into life, and had union and communion with God. He now became as merry as before he had been &s;orrowful, and &s;ung in Mr. We&s;ley's &s;train,

<P>But the&s;e extraordinary accounts and di&s;|cour&s;es, together with the controver&s;iea be|tween the mother and the &s;ons, made me think they knew many matters of which I was to|tally ignorant. This created in me a defire for knowledge, that I might know who was right and who was wrong. But to my great mortification, I could not read. I knew mo&s;t of the letters, and a few ea&s;y words, and I &s;et about learning with all my might. My mi&s;tre&s;s would &s;ometimes in&s;truct me; and having three half pence per week allowed me by my mother, this money I gave to John (my ma&s;ter's younge&s;t &s;on) and for every three half pence he taught me to &s;pell one hour; this was done in the dark, as we were not allowed a candle after we were &s;ent up &s;tairs to bed.</P>
<P>I &s;oon made a little progre&s;s in reading; in the mean time I al&s;o went to the Method|i&s;t meeting. There, as "enthu&s;ia&s;m is the child of melancholy," I caught the infection.

<P>IT is per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> worth remarking, that what the methodi&s;ts wall conviction of &s;in, being awakened, &amp;c. is often a mo&s;t dreadful &s;tate, and has the v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;ame effect on &s;uch as have lived a very in|nocent life as it has upon the mo&s;t notorious offenders; this conviction (as they call it) is brought about by the preachers heaping all the cur&s;es in the Bible on the heads of the mo&s;t virtuous as well as mo&s;t vicious; for, &s;ay they, he who keepeth the whole law and offendeth but in one point, is as much in a &s;tate of damnation, as he that hath bro|ken every one of the commandments, or commitied robbery, murder, &amp;c. &s;o that
<PB N="49" REF="030668_0047_0FE8573EE0731930">they pour out every aw&s;ul denunciation &s;ound in the Bible, and many not &s;ound there, again&s;t all who have not the method|i&s;tical faith: this they call &s;haking the people over the mouth of hell.</P>
<P>Thus are many who before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed "con&s;iences void of offence towards God and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d" tricked out of their peace of mind, by the ignorant application of texts of &s;cripture. Their fears being once &s;o dreadfully la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, they often become in|&s;upportable to them&s;elves and all around them; many in this &s;tate have put a period to their exi&s;tence, others run mad, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If the above terror of con&s;cience was only to take place in knaves and ra&s;cals, there would be no rea&s;on for blaming the method|i&s;ts on that head; "the wretch de&s;erves the hell he feels."</P>
<P>But the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e among&s;t the methodi&s;ts, they work on the fears of the mo&s;t virtuous; youth and innocence fall victims daily before their threats of hell and damna|tion, and the poor &s;eeble minded, in&s;tead of being comforted and encouraged are often by them &s;unk into an irrecoverable &s;tate of gloomy de&s;pondence and horrible de&s;pair.</P>
<P>It is true that many of their hearers are not only methodi&s;tically convinced, or alarmed,
<PB N="50" REF="030668_0048_0FE8574636D03DE8">but are al&s;o <HI>hocus pocu&s;ly</HI> converted; but with thou&s;ands that is not the ca&s;e, even with tho&s;e who join their &s;ociety, where &s;o much of divine love, a&s;&s;urance, and exta&s;ies are talked of, where enthu&s;ia&s;tic, rapturous, intoxicating hymns are &s;ung, and befides the unhappy mortals in their own community, thou&s;ands there are who have loll their peace of mind by occa&s;ionally hearing their &s;er|mons.</P>
<P>And even tho&s;e among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> have arrived to the highe&s;t pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and who at times talk of their &s;oreta&s;te of heaven, and of their full a&s;&s;urance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> forgiven, and of talking to the Deity as &s;u|miliarly as they will to one another; (all which, and much more, I have heard a thou&s;and times) yet even tho&s;e very pre|tended &s;avorites of heaven are (if we believe them&s;elves) mi&s;erable for the greate&s;t part of their time, having doubts, fears, horrors of mind, &amp;c. continually haunting them wherever they are. Between twenty and thirty years &s;ince &s;ome thou&s;ands of them in London took it into their heads that the world would be at an end on &s;uch a night, and for &s;ome days previous to this fatal night, nothing was attended to but fa&s;ting and praying, and when it came, they made a watch-night of it, and &s;pent it in prayer,
<PB N="51" REF="030668_0049_0FE8582977204E00">&amp;c. expecting every moment to be the la&s;t; and it is remarkable, that thou&s;ands who were not methodi&s;ts gave credit to this ri|diculous prophecy, and were terribly alarm|ed; but the next morning they were a&s;hamed to look at one another, and many dur&s;t not appear in their &s;hops for &s;ome time after|wards. But others of them &s;aid that God had heard the prayers of the righteous, and &s;o &s;pared the world a little longer. Some years after that Mr. We&s;ley alarmed his people all over England with the tail of a comet; great numbers were dreadfully ap|prehen&s;ive le&s;t this comet &s;hould &s;corch the carth to a cinder; but the &s;aints by prayer made the comet keep a proper di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Charnock, of the la&s;t century, in his di&s;|cour&s;e on Providence, has proved (in his way) that the univer&s;e was created and kept agoing for the &s;ake of the elect, and that as &s;oon as their number is complete, the whole will be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The fanatics in every age have found their account in making their followers believe the end of the world was at hand. In &s;ome of the wills and deeds by which e&s;tates have been given to mona&s;teries, &amp;c. in France, they have expre&s;&s;ed their belief of the world's being nearly at an end, as a rea&s;on for mak|ing &s;uch liberal donations to the church.&mdash;
<PB N="52" REF="030668_0050_0FE85747D56ADD48">But it is happy for us that in England &s;uch wills would be &s;et a&s;ide. A ca&s;e of this na|ture occurred while Lord Northington was at the head of the law department. Reilly the preacher, had whedled, or frightened, an old woman (Mrs. Norton) out of a deed of gi&s;t of fi&s;ty pounds per year, but after the old woman's panic and fear of damnation was over, &s;he had recour&s;e to Chancery and his Lord&s;hip annulled the deed of gi&s;t. His Lord&s;hip's remarks on &s;uch kinds of impo|&s;ition are very curious, and worth your reading. See Collectanea Juridica, vol. 1. p. 458.</P>
<P>In fact, the very be&s;t of the methodi&s;ts are like children, elated or depre&s;&s;ed by mere tri&s;les; and many who joined them while young and ignorant, quit their &s;ociety as they attain to years of di&s;cretion, or as their judgment is better informed.</P>

<P>THE enthu&s;ia&s;tic no|tions which I had imbibed, and the de&s;ire I had to be talking about religious my&s;teries, &amp;c. an&s;wered one valuable purpo&s;e; as it cau&s;ed me to embrace every opportunity to learn to read, &s;o that I could &s;oon read the ea&s;y parts of the Bible, Mr. We&s;ley's Hymns, &amp;c. and every lei&s;ure minute was &s;o employed.</P>
<P>In the winter I was obliged to attend my work from &s;ix in the morning until ten at night. In the &s;ummer half year, I only worked as long as we could &s;ce without can|dle; but notwith&s;tanding the clo&s;e attenti|on I was obliged to pay to my trade, yet for a long time I read ten chapters in the Bible every day; I al&s;o read and learned many hymns, and as &s;oon as I could procure &s;ome of Mr. We&s;ley's Tracts, Sermons, &amp;c. I read them al&s;o; many of them I peru&s;ed in <HI>Cloacina's</HI> Temple, (the place where my Lord Che&s;terfield advi&s;ed his &s;on to read the cla&s;&s;ics, but I did not apply them after reading to the farther u&s;e that his Lord&s;hip hints at.)</P>
<P>I had &s;uch good eyes, that I often read by the light of the Moon, as my ma&s;ter would

And &s;o ignorantly and imprudently zealous (being a r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al methodi&s;t) was I for the good of their <HI>precious</HI> &s;ouls, as &s;ometimes to give them broad hints of it, and of the dangerous &s;tate they were in. Their pious good old mini&s;ter, the Reverend Mr. Har|ri&s;on, I called <HI>"a blind leader of the blind;"</HI> and I more than once a&s;&s;ured my mi&s;tre&s;s, that both he and his whole &s;tock were in a &s;tate of damnation being "&s;trangers to the hope of I&s;rael, and without God in the world." My good mi&s;tre&s;s wifely thought that a good &s;tick was the be&s;t way of argu|ing with &s;uch an ignorant infatuated boy as I was, and had often recour&s;e to it; but I took care to give her a deal of trouble; for whenever I was ordered in my turn to read in the Bible, I always &s;elected &s;uch chapters as I thought militated again&s;t Ari|ans, Socinians, &amp;c. and &s;uch ver&s;es as I deemed &s;avorable to the doctrine of Orgined Sin, Ju&s;tification by Faith, imputed Right|eou&s;ne&s;s,

<P>Among other places I thought (having &s;o been taught by the methodi&s;ts) that the &s;ixteenth chapter of Ezekiel very much favored the doctrines of original &s;in, impu|ted Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c. that chapter I often &s;elected and read to her, and &s;he as often read the eighteenth chapter of the &s;ame pro|phecy, for the &s;ake of the parable of the Father's eating <HI>&s;our grapes.</HI></P>
<P>Whenever I read in St. Paul's Epi&s;tles on Ju&s;tification by faith alone, my good mi&s;tre&s;s would read in the Epi&s;tle of St. James, &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as &s;ay that a man is not ju&s;tified by faith alone, but by faith and works, which often embarra&s;&s;ed me not a Jittle. However I comforted my&s;elf with the conceit of having more texts of Scripture on my &s;ide of the que&s;tion than &s;he had on her &s;ide. As to St. James, I was almo&s;t ready to conclude, that he was not quite orthodox, and &s;o at la&s;t I did not much mind what he &s;aid.</P>

Hitherto I had not frequented the metho|di&s;t meetings by the con&s;ent or knowledge of my ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s; nor had my zeal been &s;o great as to make me openly violate their commands. But as my zeal increa&s;ed much fa&s;ter than my knowledge I &s;oon di&s;|regarded their orders, and without he&s;itation ran away to hear a methodi&s;tical &s;ermon as often as I could find opportunity.

I opened the Bible for direction what to do (ignorant methodi&s;ts often prac|ti&s;e the &s;ame &s;uper&s;titious method) and the fir&s;t words I read were the&s;e, "He has given his angels charge concerning thee, le&s;t at any time tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould&s;t da&s;h thy foot again&s;t a &s;tone."

<P>IN the fourth year of my apprentice&s;hip my ma&s;ter died; now although he was a good hu&s;band, a good fa|ther, and a good ma&s;ter, &amp;c. yet as he had not the methodi&s;tical faith, and could not pronounce the <HI>Shibboleth</HI> of that &s;ect, I <HI>pi|ou&s;ly</HI> feared that he was gone to hell.</P>
<P>My mi&s;tre&s;s thought that his death was ha&s;tened by his unea&s;y re&s;lections on the bad behaviour of his &s;ons after they com|menced methodi&s;ts, as before they were <HI>con|verted</HI> each was dutiful and attended to his trade, but after they became <HI>&s;aints</HI> they at|tended &s;o much to their &s;piritual concerns that they acted as though they &s;uppo&s;ed they were to be fed and cloathed by miracles, like Mr. Huntingdon, who informs us in his book called "The Bank of Faith," that the Lord &s;ent him a pair of breeches, that a dog brought him mutton to eat, fi&s;h died at night in a pond on purpo&s;e to be eaten by him in the morning; money, and in &s;hort every thing he could de&s;ire he obtained by prayer.

To give you a better idea of methodi&s;ti|cal ignorance and neglect of ordinary means of living, &amp;c. I will relate one in&s;tance more. Mary Hubbard (an old woman of Mr. We&s;ley's &s;ociety) would often wa&s;h her linen, hang it out to dry, and go away to work in the fields, or to Taunton market, four miles from her hou&s;e; and when blam|ed, &s;he would an&s;wer "that the Lord watch|ed over her, and all that &s;he had, and that he would prevent any per&s;on from &s;tealing her two old &s;mocks, or if he permitted them to be &s;tolen he would &s;end her two new in their &s;tead." And I &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;ure you, &s;ir, that there are many thou&s;and Mary Hub|bards among&s;t the methodi&s;ts.</P>
<P>As I had been bound to my mi&s;tre&s;s as well as my ma&s;ter, I was of cour&s;e an ap|prentice &s;till. But after my ma&s;ter's death I obtained more liberty of con&s;cience (as I called it) &s;o that I not only went to hear the meth di&s;t &s;ermons, but was al&s;o admitted into their &s;ociety; and I believe they never had a more devou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> enthu&s;ia&s;tical mem|ber; for &s;everal years I regularly attended every &s;ermon and all their private meetings.</P>
<P>As you are probably unacquainted with the nature of the&s;e <HI>private meetings,</HI> a &s;hort account of them may perhaps afford you &s;ome amu&s;ement.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="030668_0058_0FE8576F993677C0">
The late Mr. We&s;ley in&s;tituted among&s;t his people, be&s;ides the public preachings, &s;everal kinds of private meetings; and as the <HI>prayer-meeting</HI> is the lea&s;t private of any of them, I will &s;ir&s;t take notice of that.</P>
<P>To the prayer-meetings, which were in general held in private hou&s;es, they often invited people who were not of their &s;ociety. An hymn was fir&s;t &s;ung, then they all knelt, and the fir&s;t per&s;on who felt a motion made an extemporary prayer; when he had done another began, and &s;o on, for about two hours.</P>
<P>But it &s;o happened &s;ometimes, that one of the brethren began to pray without hav|ing <HI>the gi&s;t</HI> of prayer (as they call it) and then he often &s;tuck fa&s;t, like &s;ome of the young orators at Coach ker's Hall, &amp;c. Prayer-meetings were held in &s;uch high e&s;|teem among&s;t them that they a&s;&s;erted, more were <HI>"born again",</HI> and more "<HI>made free</HI> from all the remains of &s;in," or in other words of their own, "made <HI>perfect</HI> as God is perfect" in the&s;e kinds of meeting, than at public preaching, &amp;c. Thus, as Pom&s;ret &s;ays,</P>
<L>"The &s;pirite heated will &s;trange things produce."</L>
<P>But it is impo&s;&s;ible for you, my friend, to
<PB N="61" REF="030668_0059_0FE8577617B922A8">form any ju&s;t idea of the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, ex|cept you had been pre&s;ent at them: one wheedles and coaxes the Divine Being, in his addre&s;&s;es; another is amorous and lu&s;|cious; and a third &s;o rude and commanding, he will even tell the Deity that he mu&s;t be <HI>a liar</HI> if he does not grant all they a&s;k. In this manner will they work up one another's imaginations until they may actually be &s;aid to be in a &s;tate of intoxication, and whil&s;t in this intoxicated &s;tate, it often happens that &s;ome of them recollect a text of &s;cripture, &s;uch as "thy &s;ins are forgiven thee," or "go and &s;in no more," &amp;c. and then they declare them&s;elves to be born again, or to be &s;anctified, &amp;c.</P>
<P>They have another kind of private meet|ing after the public preaching on Sunday evenings, in which the preacher meets all the members of the &s;ociety, who &s;tay behind after the general congregation is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. To this &s;ociety the preacher gave &s;uch ad|vice as he deemed better &s;uited to a godly few than to a promi&s;cuous multidue of "<HI>outvard court</HI> wor&s;hippers."</P>
<P>Their <HI>love-fea&s;t</HI> is al&s;o a private meeting of as many members of the community as plea&s;e to attend; and they generally come from all parts within &s;everal miles of the place where love-fea&s;ts are held.</P>

<P>At the&s;e times the &s;pirit is &s;uppo&s;ed to be very powerfully at work among&s;t them; and &s;uch an <HI>uni&s;on</HI> of &s;ighing and <HI>groaning</HI> &s;ucceeds, that you would think they had all lo&s;t their &s;en&s;es.

The hymns which they &s;ing on tho&s;e nights, were wrote for &s;uch occa&s;ions, and abound with gloomy ideas, which are increa&s;ed by the time of night; and it mu&s;t be remarked, that the major part of tho&s;e who attend the&s;e nocturnal meetings having fa&s;ted the whole of the day (according to Mr. We&s;ley's orders) are in a very proper &s;tate of mind to entertain the mo&s;t extravagant whims or enthu&s;ia&s;tic no|tions that can po&s;&s;ibly enter the heads of any vi&s;ionaries. So that &s;uch nights are often very prolific, as numbers are &s;aid to be born again, and become the temples of the Holy Gho&s;t on watch-nights, which makes tho&s;e nights e&s;teemed by them.</P>
<P>Mr. We&s;ley, in every place where his people were numerous, had divided them into <HI>cla&s;&s;es,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of twelve or fourteen brothers or &s;i&s;ters. Sometimes men and women met together in the &s;ame <HI>cla&s;s</HI> (as they called it) and other cla&s;&s;es con&s;i&s;ted of all men or all women. Each of the&s;e cla&s;|&s;es had one in it who was called the <HI>leader.</HI> In &s;uch cla&s;&s;es where men and women met together, the leader was always a brother: and &s;o of cour&s;e when the cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of men alone. But in the women's cla&s;&s;es a &s;i&s;ter was always the leader.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="030668_0063_0FE85785D874E8F8">
When they met together, the leader fir&s;t gave out an hymn, which they all &s;ang; after the hymn they all knelt, and their leader made an extemporary prayer; after which they were &s;eated, and when the leader had informed them of the &s;tate of his own mind, he enquired of all pre&s;ent, one after another, how they found the &s;tate of their &s;ouls. Some he found were full of faith and <HI>a&s;&s;urance,</HI> others had dreadful doubts and fears; &s;ome had horrid temptations; others complained of a lukewarm &s;tate, &amp;c. In the&s;e meetings &s;ome of the members &s;poke of them&s;elves, as though they were as pure as angels are in heaven, but with the gene|rality of them, it was far otherwi&s;e, and no|thing was more common among them than to hear the major part exclaiming again&s;t them&s;elves, and declaring that they were the mo&s;t vile and abandoned wretches on this &s;ide hell, that they wondered why the earth did not open and &s;wallow them up alive. But they generally added, that "the blood of Chri&s;t clean&s;es from all &s;in," and that "where &s;in abounded there would grace much more abound." Indeed it was ea&s;y to remark that the rea&s;on why they painted them&s;elves in &s;uch odious colous, was only to boa&s;t of an a&s;toni&s;hing quantity of grace
<PB N="66" REF="030668_0064_0FE8578D9623E860">that God had be&s;towed on them, in thus pardoning all their abominations and num|bering them with the hou&s;ehold of faith, who ought to have been &s;hut up in the nether|mo&s;t hell. To each of the&s;e the leader gave a word of comfort, or of correction in the be&s;t manner he was able. They then &s;ang and prayed again. This la&s;ted about one hour. And every one in Mr. We&s;ley's connection did, or was expected to meet, each in his own cla&s;s once in a week. In the&s;e cla&s;&s;es each made a weekly contribu|tion towards the general &s;upport of the preachers, &amp;c. Such as were very poor con|tributed a penny per week, others two-pence, and &s;ome who could afford it, &s;ix-pence. This money was entered in a book kept for that purpo&s;e, and one in every cla&s;s called the &s;teward, had the care of the ca&s;h.</P>
<P>I now come to &s;peak of the <HI>Bands,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ted only of <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> per&s;ons; that is &s;uch as had received the <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> of their &s;ins being pardoned. In the cla&s;&s;es, both the <HI>awakened</HI> (as they call them) and the ju&s;tified, and even tho&s;e that we e made <HI>perfect</HI> met all together, as did the married and the &s;ingle, and often men and women. but none were admitted into any <HI>band</HI> but &s;uch as were at lea&s;t in a ju&s;tified &s;tate, and the married of each &s;ex met by them&s;elves,
<PB N="67" REF="030668_0065_0FE8578F2152E628">and the &s;ingle by them&s;elves. About ten was the number generally put in one band; all the&s;e mu&s;t belong to and meet in &s;ome cla&s;s, once a week, when not hindered by &s;ickne&s;s &amp;c. and they were al&s;o to meet weekly in their band. When met, they fir&s;t &s;ung, then made a &s;hort prayer; that done, the <HI>band-leader</HI> informed them of the &s;tate of his mind during the la&s;t week, &amp;c. He then made enquiry into the &s;tate of all pre&s;ent, and each related what had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince they la&s;t met; and what vi&s;itations they had received from God, what tempta|tions from the devil, the &s;le&s;h, &amp;c. And it is a maxim among&s;t them that expo&s;ing to one another what the devil has particu|larly tempted them to commit, will make the old fellow more careful how he tempts, when he knows that all his &s;ecrets will be told the next meeting. In the cla&s;&s;es they only confe&s;&s;ed in general terms, that they have been tempted by the world, the fle&s;h and the devil. But in the bands they con|fe&s;&s;ed the particular fins which they had been tempted to commit, or had actually committed.</P>
<P>The la&s;t time I met in band was in Lon|don, where an old man (near &s;eventy years of age) informed us that he had for &s;everal weeks together laboured under a very griev|ous
<PB N="68" REF="030668_0066_0FE8579818321398">temptation of the devil, who all this time had been con&s;tantly tempting him to commit adultery; he farther informed us, that having let too much of his hou&s;e to lodgers, they were obliged to put the maid's bed in the room where he and his wife &s;lept; and that one morning he had &s;een the maid lying a&s;leep, nearly or quite uncovered, and he again a&s;&s;ured us that ever &s;ince that time the devil had been every day tempting him to do that which was nought with the maid. I could not help thinking the old gentleman was right in charging it on the <HI>devil,</HI> as there was little rea&s;on to think it was any tempta|tion of <HI>the fle&s;h.</HI> Permit me to add, that this <HI>old buck</HI> had a wi&s;e about half his own age. I have been informed that &s;ome young men of the brotherhood, have at times di&s;|gui&s;ed them&s;elves in women's clothes, and have &s;o got into the women's bands; it may be very curious to hear the confe&s;&s;ions of the holy &s;i&s;ters. By this time I &s;uppo&s;e you have had enought of <HI>band meetings.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. We&s;ley in&s;tituted another kind of private meeting for the highe&s;t order of his people, called the <HI>&s;elect bands;</HI> to which none were admitted but &s;uch as were &s;anc|tified, or made <HI>perfect</HI> in love, and freed from all the remains of fin. But as I never pro&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>perfection,</HI> I was not permitted
<PB N="69" REF="030668_0067_0FE8579F8115C948">to enter into this holy of holies. But I have known a great number of the&s;e per|fect &s;aints, of both &s;exes; and I al&s;o lived in the &s;ame hou&s;e a whole year with one of the&s;e intire holy &s;i&s;ters. A few days before I came to live in Chi&s;well-&s;treet, one of the&s;e perfect &s;i&s;ters was detected in &s;tealing coals out of the &s;hed of one of the &s;anctified biothers, but &s;he, like the old fellow above mentioned &s;aid it was the devil that tempt|ed her to do it.</P>
<P>Four times every year new <HI>tickets</HI> are di&s;tributed to all Mr. We&s;ley's people throughout the three kingdoms. Their ticket is a very &s;inall &s;lip of paper, with a text of &s;crip ure on it, which is exchanged every quarter for &s;ome other text. Such as are only in a <HI>cla&s;s,</HI> have a different text from &s;uch as are in a <HI>band,</HI> &s;o that no one can be admitted into a general meeting of the bands, appointed by any of the preach ers when he intends to give them an exhor|tation, nor into any particular band, by a common &s;ociety ticket. On the common tickets are &s;uch texts as the&s;e: "Now is the accepted time."&mdash;" Awake thou that &s;leepe&s;t," and &s;uch like. But tho&s;e for the <HI>band;</HI> are in a higher &s;train; as, "Be ye per&s;ect as your heavenly father is perfect." "Go on unto perfection,"&mdash;"Ye are chil|dren

For the&s;e tick|ets, each poor per&s;on paid one &s;hilling, &s;uch as were rich paid more; indeed the money &s;eemed to be the principal end of i&s;&s;uing tickets, at lea&s;t in country places, the mem|bers in the community being &s;o well known to each other, that they &s;carce ever &s;hewed their tickets in order to gain admittance. I forgot to inform you that prayer-meetings, cla&s;s-meetings, band-meetings, &amp;c. were in general held in private hou&s;es, belonging to &s;ome of the brethren.</P>

<PB N="71" REF="030668_0069_0FE857A84DD28F18">hu&s;bandmen, &s;hoemakers, woolcombera, weavers, their wives, &amp;c.

<P>There are thou&s;ands in this &s;ociety who will never read any thing be&s;ides the bible, and books publi&s;hed by Mr. We&s;ley. For &s;everal years I read very little el&s;e, nor would I go (at lea&s;t very &s;eldom) to any other place of wor&s;hip; &s;o that in&s;tead of hearing the &s;en&s;ible and learned mini&s;ters of Taun|ton, I would often go four, five, or &s;ix miles to &s;ome country village, to hear an in&s;pired hu&s;bandman, &s;hoemaker, black &s;mith, or wool comber; and frequently in fro&s;t and &s;now have I ro&s;e a little after midnight (not knowing what time of night it was) and have
<PB N="72" REF="030668_0070_0FE857A9DA2540A8">wandered about the town until five o'clock, when the preaching began; where I have often heard a &s;ermon preached to not more than ten or a dozen people. But &s;uch of us as did attend at this early hour, u&s;ed af|terwards to congratulate each other on the great privilege we enjoyed, then off we went to our work, &s;hivering with cold.</P>
<P>I was fir&s;t converted to methodi&s;m when I was about &s;ixteen years of age, from that time until I was twenty-one I was a very &s;in|cere enthu&s;ia&s;t, and every &s;pare hour I en|joyed I dedicated to the &s;tudy of the bible, reading methodi&s;tical books, learning hymns, hearing &s;ermons, meeting in &s;ocieties, &amp;c. My memory was very tenacious, &s;o that every thing I read I made my own. I could have repeated &s;everal volumes of hymns; when I heard a &s;ermon, I could have peach|ed it again, and nearly in the &s;ame words; my bible had hundreds of leaves folded down, and thou&s;ands of marks again&s;t &s;uch texts as I thought favoured the doctrines (or whims) which I had imbibed. So that I &s;tood forth as the champion of methodi&s;m wherever I came.</P>
<P>But alas! my godly &s;trict li&s;e at length &s;uffered interruption. I will give you a &s;ar|ther account of the method <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts when I come to the time when I finally le&s;t their &s;ociety.</P>

<P>A few days after I went to the inn where the Taunton carrier put up, to onquire after <HI>Mi&s;s Trott,</HI> as I wanted to know if &s;he had returned &s;afe to Taunton.

<P>The Taunton carrier gave me a letter from my good mi&s;tre&s;s Bowden (who by marrying again had changed her name to Dingle). The contents of this letter very much &s;urpri&s;ed me.

Our gentleman, &s;eeing that the af|fair began to look very &s;erious, now be|came calm, and informed the company that having an inclination for a frolic, he had inquired for a bad hou&s;e, and had been di|rected there; adding that if there had been any mi&s;take, he was very &s;orry for it, and would beg the lady's pardon.

<P>A very &s;trange unaccountable circum|&s;tance happened in this Inn, about the &s;ame time; one of tho&s;e occurrences that puzzle the philo&s;opher, and &s;trengthen &s;uper&s;tition in weak minds. Three or four gentlemen of the neighbourhood were drinking wine in one of the rooms, when the landlord of the Inn (as it appeared to them) walked into the room, and coming up to the table, around which they were &s;eated, they addre&s;|&s;ed him with Mr. Baldwin, how do you do? &s;it down and take a gla&s;s of wine with us; but in&s;tead of doing as reque&s;ted, the &s;uppo&s;ed Inn-keeper walked out of the room, without making any reply; which not only &s;urpri&s;|ed, but offended the company, who rung the bell violently, and on the waiter's ap|pearance, they ordered him to &s;end in his ma&s;ter. The waiter informed them that his ma&s;ter was not at home. The gentlement repli|ed that he was at home a &s;ew minutes &s;ince, and therefore they in&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing him; but the man a&s;&s;ured them they were mi&s;taken, as his ma&s;ter was in Bri&s;tol, and had been there &s;everal days. They then ordered the waiter to &s;end in Mrs. Baldwin, who imme|diately
<PB N="83" REF="030668_0081_0FE857DFB3413358">appearing, the gentlemen a&s;ked her where Mr. Baldwin was, and &s;he informed them as the waiter had already done, that he was in Bri&s;ltol, and had been there feveral days, on which the gentlemen grew very angry, and &s;wore that Mr. Baldwin had ju&s;t before come into the room, and on their re|que&s;ting him to partake of their wine, had in&s;ulted them by going out of the room, without deigning to give them an an&s;wer. Mrs. Baldwin then drew out of her pocket aletter &s;he had that morning received from Mr. Baldwin, by which it was apparent, that he really was in Bri&s;tol. The &s;tory was then told round the neighbourhood, and all the old women concluded that Mr. Bald|win mu&s;t certainly be dead, and that he died at the very in&s;tant that the gentlemen &s;aw him come into the room; but Mr. Baldwin returning two days after, rendered it nece&s;|&s;ary for them to vary their &s;tory; they then a&s;&s;erted that it was a token, or &s;ome warning of his death, and had no doubt but it would very &s;oon happen. It was generally tho't that Mr. Baldwin was weak enough to pay &s;uch attention to the &s;tory and the in&s;erence, as to hurt his health, as he really died within a year after, and the old women were not a litile <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lea&s;ed at the event, as it tended to

A more ridiculous affair happened about ten years &s;ince, at the two bells, oppo&s;ite Whitechapel church. The landlord was &s;itting one night with &s;ome jovial com|pany, one of whom happened to &s;ay that he prayed to God, that &s;uch a thing &s;hould not come to pa&s;s, the landlord replied in a good humoured manner, your prayers will neither do good or harm; upon which the other &s;aid a deal to per&s;uade the ho&s;t that his prayers would do great things; but the more he &s;aid in prai&s;e of his prayers, the more the landlord laughed at, and ridiculed him. The man at la&s;t in&s;i&s;ted that he could pray the landlord to death in two months time, and offered to bet him a crown bowl of punch to the truth of it, which the land|lord accepting, the wager was laid, and al|mo&s;t every night after this, the man came to the hou&s;e, and con&s;tantly laughed at the land|lord, and a&s;&s;ured him that he would lo&s;e his wager; and however &s;trange in may appear, our ho&s;t did die within the time, and his wi|dow paid the wager. I think there cannot remain a doubt but that the ridiculous talk of the fellow actually affected the landlord's mind, and ha&s;tened his death, and the fol|lowing in&s;tances tend al&s;o to &s;hew how ea&s;ily the lives of &s;ome are &s;hortened.</P>

This was a &s;ea&s;t indeed to me, who had never before &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en nor even read any theatrical production. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for me to de&s;cribe my &s;en&s;ations on the occa&s;ion. Between the play and the entertainment (which was the Mayor of Garrat) Mr Edward Shuter performed a &s;hort piece called "The dunken man."
<PB N="87" REF="030668_0085_0FE857F17A525BE0">This was the only time that I ever &s;aw that extraordinary genius, but he made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, that it is impo&s;&s;ible I ever &s;hould forget him.

<P>Since the publication of the fir&s;t edition of the&s;e memoirs, I have read "The me|moirs of Mr. Tate Wilkin&s;on," patentee of the Theatres Royal of York and Hull, and was much &s;urpri&s;ed to learn that the famous Ned Shuter was a <HI>gracious &s;oul.</HI> I will give you a pa&s;&s;age or two out of Mr. Wil|kin&s;on's memoirs, vol. ii. page 142, 12mo edition, &amp;c.

And O! may you all like that dear good woman "work the harder."

"There|fore," added Whitefield, "I will bawl, I will not be a velvet-mouthed preacher." I leave the reader to judge on the good rea&s;oning of methodi&s;m.

But Mr. Foote was only a &s;py at Whitefield's academy, while I had been a zealot for &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons before my encoun|ter at Covent Garden with Mr. Foote. My attendance had been con&s;tant with my friend Shuter, and as he was actually one of the new-born, and paid large &s;ums to White|field, I was always permitted to &s;tay with him, for he really was bewildered in his brain, more by wi&s;hing to acquire imagina|ry grace, than by all his drinking; and whenever he was warm with the bottle, and with only a friend or two, like Maw-worm he could not mind his &s;hop, becau&s;e he thought it was a &s;in, and wi&s;hed to go a preaching; for &s;huter, like Maw-worm, be|lieved he had a call. I have gone with Shuter at &s;ix in the morning of a Sunday to Tottenham Court Road, then before ten to Mr. We&s;ley's in Long Acre, at eleven again to Tottenham Court Road tabernacle, dined near Bedlam in Moorfields (a very proper place for us both) with a party of the holy ones, went at three to Mr. We&s;ley's theatre there (the tabernacle I mean) from that to Whitefield's in Moorfields till eight, and
<PB N="101" REF="030668_0099_0FE858336C5DF8A0">then &s;hut up to commune with the family compact. Now with all this practice and attention, and with my natural talents, I mu&s;t have been a blockhead indeed not to have gleaned &s;ome good things (and doubt|le&s;s Mr. Whitefield was at times a good preacher, and truly excellent). I therefore really exhibited and obtained a much &s;tronger likene&s;s as Dr. Squintum, than Mr. Foote did. The week before my Covent Garden exhibition, I met my friend Shuter at the tabernacle; a great coolne&s;s had con|tinued for &s;ome time, as we had not &s;poke to or even looked at each other &s;ince the breach between us in the year 1758; but as we were met together in a place of chari|ty and forgivene&s;s to all who &s;ub&s;cribed to the dictator, we became very &s;ociable, and before the conclu&s;ion of Whitefield's lec|ture were perfectly reconciled. We ad|journed to the Ro&s;e, and by three the next morning were &s;worn friends, and contunued &s;o till death called him away. Indeed he was above cleven years older than me, and would have been &s;ixty three had he lived to this time. Ned Shuter was a lively, &s;pirit|ed &s;hrewd companion; &s;uperior natural whim and humour &s;urely never inhabited a human brea&s;t, for what he &s;aid and did was all his own, as it was with difficulty he could

<P>It is &s;ingular enough that about this time, although I could not write, yet I compo&s;ed &s;everal &s;ongs, one of which was &s;old for a guinea; &s;ome were given to the Bri&s;tol printers, who printed them and the ballad-fingers &s;ung them about the &s;treets; on which occa&s;ions I was as proud as though I, had compo&s;ed an opera. My friend Mr. Jones was my &s;ecretary, who before I came to live with him had not the lea&s;t reli&s;h for books, and I had only read a few enthu&s;i|a&s;tic authors, together with Pomfret's poems, this la&s;t I could almo&s;t repeat by memory;

<P>One day as my friend Jones and I were &s;trolling about the fair that is annually held in and near St. James's church yard, we &s;aw a &s;tall of books, and in looking over the title pages, I met with Hobbes's tran&s;lation of Homer's Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey. I had &s;ome|how or other heard that Homer was a great poet, but unfortunately I had never heard of Pope's tran&s;lation of him, &s;o we very eager|ly purcha&s;ed that by Hobbes. At this &s;tall I al&s;o purcha&s;ed Walker's poetical paraphra&s;e of Epictetus's morals; and home we went, perfectly well plea&s;ed with our bargains.</P>
<P>We that evening began with Hobbes's Homer; but found it very difficult for us to read, owing to the ob&s;curity of the tran&s;|lation, which together with the different language, and want of poetical merit in the tran&s;lator, &s;omewhat di&s;appointed us: how|ever we had from time to time many a hard puzzling hour with him.</P>
<P>But as to Walker's Epictetus, although that had not much poetical merit, yet it was very ea&s;y to be read, and as ea&s;ily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">er|&s;tood. The principles of the <HI>&s;loics</HI> charmed me &s;o much, that I made the book my com|panior
<PB N="105" REF="030668_0103_0FE85849D4459B10">wherever I went, and read it over and over in raptures, thinking that my mind was &s;ecured again&s;t all the &s;miles or frowns of fortune.</P>
<P>I now grew weary of di&s;&s;ipating my time, and began to think of employing my &s;pare hours in &s;omething more &s;atisfactory. For want of &s;omething el&s;e to do, I went one evening to hear Mr. John We&s;ley preach in Broadmead, and being completely tired of the way of life that I had lived (more or le&s;s) ever &s;ince I had been out of my ap|prentice&s;hip, and happening to have no other pur&s;uit or hobby-hor&s;e, there was a kind of vacuity in my mind; in this &s;tate I was very &s;u&s;ceptible of any impre&s;&s;ions, &s;o that when I came to hear Mr. We&s;ley, my old fanatical notions returned full upon me, and I was once more carried away by the tide of enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>My friend Mr. Jones &s;oon &s;aw with grief and indignation the wonderful alteration in me; who, from a gay, volatile, di&s;&s;ipated young fellow, was at once metamorpho&s;ed into a dull, moping, praying, p&s;alm-&s;inging fanatic, continually reprehending all about me for their harmle&s;s mirth and gaity.</P>

Nothing is more common than to &s;ee mankind run from one extreme to another: which was my ca&s;e once more.</P>
<P>About this time we left our habitation in Queen-&s;treet and took lodgings of Mr. Jones's mother, on St. Philip's Plain, where lived a brother of Mr. Jones, who was about &s;eventeen years of age.

<P>But what we wanted in judgment in choo&s;ing our library, we made up in appli|cation; &s;o anxious were we to read a great deal, that we allowed our&s;elves but about three hours &s;leep in twenty-four, and for &s;ome months together we never were all in bed at the &s;ame time (Sunday nights ex|cepted).

<P>But this mad &s;cheme of ours had nearly
<PB N="113" REF="030668_0111_0FE8586F70BA3670">been attended with very &s;erious con&s;equen|ces. One night it being my turn to watch, I removed to the &s;ire &s;ide, to read &s;ome par|ticular pa&s;&s;age, and the candle&s;tick which we worked by not being convenient to move about, and there being no other at that time in the room, I &s;et up the candle again&s;t the handle of a pewter pot, and was &s;o extreme|ly heavy (owing to much watchfulne&s;s) that I &s;ell fa&s;t a&s;leep and had like never to have awaked again; for the candle burned down to the handle of the pot, melted it off, and then fell on the chair on which it &s;tood; &s;o that Mr. Jones &s;ound me in the morning, fa&s;t a&s;leep, and part of the chair con&s;umed; which alarmed us all very much, and made us more cautious.</P>
<P>But &s;till we continued our plan of living, &s;o that we made a napid progre&s;s in what we called &s;piritual and divine knowledge; and were &s;oon ma&s;ters of the various arguments made u&s;e of by mo&s;t polemical divines, &amp;c.</P>

I now can &s;carce help thinking that I received more real be|nefit from reading and &s;tudying them and Epictetus, than from all other books that I had read before, or have ever read &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>I was but about twenty-two years of age, when I fir&s;t began to read tho&s;e fine moral productions; and I a&s;&s;ure you, my friend, that they made a very deep and la&s;ting im|pre&s;&s;ion on my mind.

<P>The plea&s;ures of eating and drinking I entirely de&s;pi&s;ed, and for &s;ome time carried this di&s;po&s;ition to an extreme. The account of Epicurus living in his garden, at the ex|pence of about a halfpenny per day, and that when he added a little chee&s;e to his bread on particular occa&s;ions, he con&s;idered it as a luxury, &s;illed me with raptures. From that moment I began to live on bread and tea, and for a con&s;iderable time did not partake of any other viands, but in tho&s;e I indulged my&s;elf three or four times a day. My rea|&s;ons for living in this ab&s;temious manner were in order to &s;ave money to purcha&s;e

<P>I continued the above &s;elf-denying life until I left Bri&s;tol, which was, on Whit&s;un|day in 1769. I had for &s;ome time before been pointing out to my friend John Jones &s;ome of the plea&s;ures and advantages of tra|velling, &s;o that I ea&s;ily prevailed on him to accompany me towards the we&s;t of England; and in the evening we arrived at Bridgowa|ter, where Mr. Jones got work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. He was employed by Mr. Ca&s;h, with whom be con|tinued
<PB N="118" REF="030668_0116_0FE85887489799A8">near twelve months, and in the end married Mr. Ca&s;h's daughter, a very pretty and very amiable little woman, with &s;ome fortune. When my friend was offered work by Mr. Ca&s;h, I prevailed on him to accept of it, a&s;&s;uring him that I had no doubt of my being able to get work at Taunton: but in that I was di&s;appointed, nor could I get a con&s;tant &s;eat of work until I came to Ex|eter, and of that place I was &s;oon tired; but being informed that a Mr. John Taylor of King&s;bridge (forty miles below Exeter) wanted &s;uch a hand, I went down, and was gladly received by Mr. Taylor, who&s;e name in&s;pires me with gratitude, as he never treat|ed me as a journeyman, but made me his companion: Nor was any part of my time ever &s;pent in a more agreeable plea&s;ing manner than that which I pa&s;&s;ed in this re|tired place, or I believe more profitable to a ma&s;ter. I was the fir&s;t man he ever had that was able to make &s;tuff and &s;ilk &s;hoes, and it being al&s;o known that I came from Bri&s;tol, this had great weight with the coun|try ladies, and procured my ma&s;ter cu&s;tom|ers, who generally &s;ent for me to take mea|&s;ure of their &s;eet, and I was looked upon by all to be the be&s;t workman in the town, although I had not been brought up to &s;tuff work, nor had ever entirely made one &s;tuff
<PB N="119" REF="030668_0117_0FE8588B6955A270">or &s;ilk &s;hoe before. Nor &s;hould I have pre&s;umed to proclaim my&s;elf a &s;tuff-man, had there been any &s;uch workmen in the place; but as there were none, I boldly ventured, and &s;ucceeded very well; nor did any one in the town ever know that it was my fir&s;t attempt in that branch.</P>
<P>During the time that I lived here, I as u&s;ual was obliged to employ one or another of my acquaintance to write my letters for me; this procured me much prai&s;e among the young men as a good editor of letters; (I need not inform you that they were not good judges). My ma&s;ter &s;aid to me one day, he was &s;urpri&s;ed that I did not learn to write my own letters; and added, that he was &s;ure that I could learn to do it in a very &s;hort time. The thought plea&s;ed me much, and without any delay I &s;et about it, by tak|ing up any pieces of paper that had writing on them, and imitating the letters as well as I could. I employed my lei&s;ure hours in this way for near two months, after which time I wrote my own letters, in a bad hand you may be &s;ure; but it was plain and ea&s;y to read, which was all I cared for: nor to the pre&s;ent moment can I write much bet|ter, as I never would have any per&s;on to teach me, nor was I ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of pa|tience enough to employ time &s;ufficient to
<PB N="120" REF="030668_0118_0FE84D2C16E28540">learn to write well; and yet as &s;oon as I was able to &s;ub&s;cribe, I wrote ver&s;es on &s;ome tri&s;le or other every day for years to|gether.</P>
<P>But I always wrote as fa&s;t as I could, without endeavouring to write well, and that this is my pre&s;ent practice I need not inform you.</P>
<P>I came to this place in but a weak &s;tate of body, however the healthy &s;ituation of the town, together with bathing in the &s;alt water, &s;oon re&s;tored me to perfect health. I pa&s;&s;ed thirteen months here in a very hap|py manner: but the wages for work being very low, and as I had &s;pent much time in writing hymns to every &s;ong tune that I knew, be&s;ides a number of love ver&s;es, let|ters, &amp;c. I was very poor; and to com|plete all, I began to keep a deal of company, in which I gave a loo&s;e to my natural gal|ety of di&s;po&s;ition, much more than was con|&s;i&s;tent with the grave, &s;edate ideas which I had &s;ormed of a religious character; all which made me re&s;olve to leave King&s;|bridge, which I did in 1770.</P>
<P>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> as for as Exeter the fir&s;t day, where I wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed about a fortnight, and &s;ay|ed &s;ufficient to carry me to Bridgewater, where I worked two or three weeks more. Before I arrived there Mr. John Jones had
<PB N="121" REF="030668_0119_0FE85895568D4120">gone back to re&s;ide at Bri&s;tol, but as &s;oon as he heard of my being in Bridgewater, he and his brother Richard &s;ent me an invita|tion to come to Bri&s;tol again and live with them. Finding that I did not immediately comply, they both came to Bridgewater, and declared their intentions of not returning to Bri&s;tol without me; &s;o that after a day or two I yielded to their &s;olicitations, and again lived very comfortably with them, their mother and &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>I think it was about this period, that I went &s;everal times to the tabernacle, and heard Mr. George Whitefield; and of all the preachers that ever I attended, never did I meet with one that had &s;uch a perfect command over the pa&s;&s;ions of his audience. In every &s;ermon that I heard him preach, he would &s;ometimes make them ready to bur&s;t with laughter, and the next moment drown them in tears; indeed it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t guarded to e&s;cape the effect.</P>

<P>In one of my excur&s;ions I pa&s;&s;ed many agreeable hours with the late Mr. La Bute, at Cambridge, who was well known, he having taught French in that univer&s;ity up|wards of forty years. He informed me that near forty years &s;ince, Mr. Whitefield hav|ing adverti&s;ed him&s;elf to preach at Gog-Ma|gog hill, many thou&s;and people collected together from many miles round. While he was preaching he was clevated on the highe&s;t ground, and his audience &s;tood all round on the declivity; during his &s;ermon, a young country-woman, who had come &s;ome miles to hear him, and waited &s;everal hours, being very faint, owing to the vio|lent heat of the &s;un, the breaths of the mul|titude, as well as the want of refre&s;hment; and it is very likely much agitated in her mind by the extraordinary doctrines of the preacher, &s;he fell backwards, ju&s;t under the orator, and there lay kicking up her heels. On &s;eeing the poor girl lie in a kind of con|vul&s;ion, &s;ome of the company moved to a&s;|&s;i&s;t her, and the women began to draw down her apron and petticoats over her &s;eet; but Mr. Whitefield cried out, <HI>"Let her alone! let her alone! A glorious &s;ight! a glorious
<PB N="123" REF="030668_0121_0FE8589E659A7318">&s;ight!"</HI> No doubt the holy man meant that it was a glorious &s;ight to &s;ee a &s;inner fall before the power of the word; but the young college bucks and wits con&s;trued his meaning differently, and put the audience into &s;uch immoderate &s;its of laughter, that even Mr. Whitfield's utmo&s;t efforts were not able to re&s;tore their gravity, but he was obliged to di&s;mi&s;s his congregation abruptly.</P>
<P>For a long time after this happened, the Cantabs as they reeled homewards in the night time, di&s;turbed the &s;ober inhabitants, by loudly exclaiming, "A glorious &s;ight! A glorious &s;ight! as Doctor Squintum &s;ays."</P>

<P>I HAD not long re|&s;ided a &s;econd time with my good Bri&s;tol friends, before I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enewed my corre&s;pon|dence with my old &s;weetheart Nancy Smith.

<P>After having worked on &s;tuff work in the country, I could not bear the idea of returning to the leather branch; &s;o that I attempted and obtained a &s;eat of &s;tuff in Bri&s;tol.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a few days after we had paid the la&s;t five &s;hillings of the debt claimed by my friend Mr. Jones, we were both together taken &s;o ill as to be confined to our bed, but the good woman of the hou&s;e, our landlady, came to our room and did a &s;ew trifles for us. She &s;eemed very
<PB N="134" REF="030668_0132_0FE858E2E3C09E50">much alarmed at our &s;ituation, or rather for her own, I &s;uppo&s;e, as thinking we might in &s;ome mea&s;ure become burthen&s;ome to her. We had in ca&s;h two &s;hillings and nine|pence, half a crown of which we had care|fully locked up in a box, to be &s;aved for a re&s;ource on any extraordinary emergence. This money &s;upported us two or three days, in which time I recovered without the help of medicine; but my wife continued ill near &s;ix months, and was confined to her bed the greate&s;t part of her time; which ill|ne&s;s may very ea&s;ily be accounted for.</P>
<P>Before &s;he came to Bri&s;tol, &s;he had ever been u&s;ed to a very active life, and had al|ways lived in the country, &s;o that in coming to dwell in a populous city, &s;he had ex|changed much exerci&s;e and good air for a &s;edentary life and very bad air; and this I pre&s;ume was the cau&s;e of all her illne&s;s from time to time, which at length, as unfortu|nately as effectually undermined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er con|&s;titution. During her fir&s;t &s;ix months illne&s;s I lived many days &s;olely on water gruel; for as I could not afford to pay a nur&s;e, much of my time was taken up in attend|ance on her, and mo&s;t of my money expend|ed in procuring medicines, together with &s;uch trifles as &s;he could eat and drink. But what added extremely to my calamity was
<PB N="135" REF="030668_0133_0FE858E46E4EB0C8">the being within the hearing of her groans, which were cau&s;ed by the excruc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ating pains in her head, which for months together de|fied the power of medicine.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for words to de&s;cribe the keenne&s;s of my &s;en&s;ations during this long term; yet as to <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> my poverty and be|ing obliged to live upon water-gruel gave me not the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>How I &s;upported this long dreary &s;cene, I know not; the bare recollection of which is exceedingly painful, even at this di&s;tance of time. At la&s;t, when every thing that &s;eem|ed
<PB N="136" REF="030668_0134_0FE858EE39C35E68">to promi&s;e relief had been ried in vain, &s;ome old woman recommended <HI>Cephalic</HI> &s;nuff. I own I had not much faith in it; however I procured it, and in a &s;hort time after &s;he was much relieved from the into|lerable pain in her head, but yet continued in a very bad &s;tate of health; her con&s;titu|tion having &s;uffered &s;uch a dreadful &s;hock, I thought that no means could be u&s;ed &s;o likely to re&s;tore it, as a removal to her na|tive air. Accordingly I left my &s;eat of work at Bri&s;tol, and returned with her to Taun|ton, which is about &s;even miles from Peth|erton, her native place. But in Taunton I could not procure &s;o much work as I could do; &s;o that as &s;oon at I thought &s;he could bear the air of Bri&s;tol, we returned thither, where &s;he &s;oon relap&s;ed, and we again went back to Taunton. This removing to Taun|ton was repeated about five times in little more than two years and a half.</P>
<P>But at la&s;t, finding that &s;he had long fits of illne&s;s at Taunton al&s;o, as well as at Bri&s;|tol, with a view of having a better price for my work I re&s;olved to vi&s;it London; and as I had not money &s;ufficient to hear the ex|pences of both to town, I left her all the money I could &s;pare, and took a place on the out&s;ide of the &s;tage coach, and the &s;e|cond day arrived in the metropolis, in Au|gu&s;t

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT this time I was as vi&s;ionary and &s;uper&s;titious as ever I had been at any preceding period, for although I had read &s;ome &s;en&s;ible books, and had thereby acquired a few rational ideas, yet having had a methodi&s;tical wife for near three years, and my keeping methodi&s;tical company, together with the gloomy notions which in &s;pite of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy I had imbibed during the frequent, long, and indeed almo&s;t con&s;tant illne&s;s of my wife, the con&s;equence was, that tho&s;e few rational or liberal ideas which I had before trea&s;ured up, were at my coming to London in a dor|mant &s;tate, or borne down by the torrent of enthu&s;ia&s;tic whims, and fanatical chimeras.</P>

So that I &s;oon procured a lodging and work, my next enquiry was for Mr. We&s;ley's <HI>Go&s;pel-&s;hops:</HI> and on producing my <HI>cla&s;s</HI> and <HI>band</HI> tickets from Taunton, I was put into a cla&s;s, and a week or two after admitted into a band.</P>
<P>But it was &s;everal weeks before I could firmly re&s;olve to continue in London; as I really was &s;truck with horror for the fate of it; more particularly on Sundays, as I found &s;o few went to church, and &s;o many were walking and riding about for plea&s;ure, and the lower cla&s;s getting drunk, quarrelling, fighting, working, buying, &s;elling, &amp;c. I had &s;een &s;o much of the &s;ame kind in Bri&s;|tol that I often wondered how God permit|ted it to &s;tand; but London I found infi|nitely wor&s;e, and &s;eriou&s;ly trembled for fear the mea&s;ure of iniquity was quite full, and that every hour would be its la&s;t. Howe|ver I at length concluded, that if London was a &s;econd <HI>Sodom,</HI> I was a &s;econd <HI>Lot;</HI> and the&s;e comfortable ideas reconciled me to the thought of living in it. Be&s;ides, &s;ome of Mr. We&s;ley's people gave me great com|fort by a&s;&s;uring me, that "the Lord had much people in this city:" which I &s;oon di&s;|covered to be true, as I got acquainted with many of tho&s;e righteous cho&s;en &s;aints, who mode&s;tly arrogate to them&s;elves that they
<PB N="140" REF="030668_0138_0FE85902F7920360">are the peculiar favourites of heaven, and con&s;equently that any place they re&s;ide in mu&s;t be &s;afe.</P>
<P>In a month I &s;aved money &s;ufficient to bring up my wife, and &s;he had a pretty to|lerable &s;tate of health; of my ma&s;ter I ob|tained &s;ome &s;tuff-&s;hoes for her to bind and nearly as much as &s;he could do. Having now plenty of work and higher wages, we were tolerably ea&s;y in our circum&s;tances, more &s;o than we ever bad been, &s;o that we &s;oon procured a few clothes. My wife had all her life before done very well with a &s;u|perfine broad cloth cloak, but now I pre|vailed on her to have one of &s;ilk.</P>
<P>Until this winter I had never found out that I wanted a <HI>great coat,</HI> but now I made that important di&s;covery; and my landlord &s;hewed me one made of a coar&s;e kind of Bath coating, which he purcha&s;ed new at a &s;hop in Ro&s;emary-lane for ten &s;hillings and &s;ix pence; &s;o that the next half guinea I had to &s;pare, away I went to Ro&s;emary-lane (and to my great &s;urpri&s;e) was hauled into a &s;hop by a fellow who was walking up and down before the door of a &s;lop&s;eller, where I was &s;oon fitted with a great coat of the &s;ame fort as that of my landlord. I a&s;ked the price; but how great was my a&s;toni&s;h|ment, when the hone&s;t &s;lop-man told me,
<PB N="141" REF="030668_0139_0FE85906AD080BB0">that he was &s;o taken with my clean, hone&s;t, indu&s;trious looks, that he would let <HI>me</HI> have it cheaper than he would his own bro|ther, &s;o in one word he would oblige <HI>me</HI> with it for five and twenty &s;hillings, which was the very money that it co&s;t him. On hearing this I cro&s;&s;ed the &s;hop in a trice, in order to &s;et off home again, but the door had a &s;a&s;tening to it beyond by comprehen|&s;ion, nor would the good man let me out before I had made him an offer. I told him I had &s;o little money about me that I could not offer any thing, and again de&s;ired that he would let me out. But he per&s;i&s;ted and at la&s;t I told him that my landlord had informed me that he had purcha&s;ed &s;uch another coat for ten &s;hillings and &s;ix pence; on which he began to give him&s;elf airs, and a&s;&s;ured me that however &s;ome people came by their goods, that for his part, he always paid for <HI>his.</HI> I heartily wi&s;hed my&s;elf out of the &s;hop, but in vain; as he &s;eemed de|termined not to part with me until I had made &s;ome offer. I then told him that I had but ten &s;hillings and &s;ix pence, and of cour&s;e could not offer him any more than I had got. I now expected more abu&s;e from him, but in&s;tead of that the patient good man told me, that as he perhaps might get &s;omething by me another time, I &s;hould have the coat for
<PB N="142" REF="030668_0140_0FE8590E702EBB68">my half guinea, although it was worth more than double the money.</P>
<P>About the end of November I received an account of the death of my grandfather; and was al&s;o informed that he had left a will in favour of my grandmother-in-law's rela|tions, who became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all his effects, except a &s;mall freehold e&s;tate, which he left to my younge&s;t brother, becau&s;e he happen|ed to be called George (which was the name of my grandfather) and ten pounds a piece to each of his other grand-children.</P>
<P>So totally unacquainted was I with the modes of tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s, that I could not point out any method of having my ten pounds &s;ent up to London, at lea&s;t no mode that the executor of the will would approve of; it being &s;uch-a <HI>prodigious</HI> &s;um, that the greate&s;t caution was u&s;ed on both &s;ides, &s;o that it co&s;t me about half the money in going down for it, and in returning to town again. This was in extremely hard fro&s;ty weather (I think &s;ome time in December) and being on the out&s;ide of a &s;tage-coach, I was &s;o very cold, that when I came to the inn where the pa&s;&s;engers dined, I went directly to the fire, which &s;truck the cold inward, &s;o that I had but a very narrow e&s;cape from death. This happened in going down. In returning back to town I had other misfortunes to encoun|ter.

The lo&s;s of my &s;ilver I bore with the temper of a &s;toic, and like Fpictetus rea&s;oned, that I could not have lo&s;t it, if I had not fir&s;t had it; and that as I had lo&s;t it, why it was all the &s;ame as though it had never been in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But a more dreadful misfortune befel me the next morning; the extreme &s;evere wea|ther &s;till continuing, in order to keep me from dying with cold, I drank &s;ome purl and gin, which (not being u&s;ed to drink any thing &s;trong) made me &s;o drunk, that the conchman put me in&s;ide the carriage for fear I &s;hould &s;all off the roof. I there met with &s;ome of the jovial &s;ort, who had al&s;o drank to keep out the cold, &s;o that I &s;ound them in high glee; being a&s;ked to &s;ing them a &s;ong, I immediately complied, and forget|ting

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH the re|mainder of the money we purcha&s;ed hou&s;e hold goods, but as we then had not &s;uffici|ent to furni&s;h a room, we worked hard, and lived &s;till harder, &s;o that in a &s;hort time we had a room furni&s;hed with our own goods; and I believe that it is not po&s;&s;ible for you to imagine with what plea&s;ure and &s;atisfacti|on we looked round the room and &s;urveyed our property: I believe that Alexander the Great never reflected on his immen&s;e acqui&s;itions with half the heart-felt enjoy|ment which we experienced on this capital attainment.</P>
<P>After our room was furni&s;hed, as we &s;till enjoyed a better &s;tate of health than we did at Bri&s;tol and Taunton, and had al&s;o more work and higher wages, we often added &s;omething or other to our &s;tock of wearing apparel. Nor did I forget the old-book &s;hops: but frequently added an old book to my &s;mall collection, and I really have often purcha&s;ed books with the money that
<PB N="146" REF="030668_0144_0FE85921A9D430E0">&s;hould have been expended in purcha&s;ing &s;omething to eat; a &s;triking in&s;tance of which follows:
At the time we were purcha&s;ing hou&s;hold goods, we kept our&s;elves very &s;hort of mo|ney, and on Chri&s;tmas-eve we had but half a crown left to buy a Chri&s;tmas dinner. My wife de&s;ired that I would go to market, and purcha&s;e this fe&s;tival dinner, and off I &s;et for that purpo&s;e; but in the way I &s;aw an old-book &s;hop, and I could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation of going in; intending only to expend &s;ixpence or ninepence out of my half-crown. But I &s;tumbled upon Young's Night Thoughts&mdash;down went my half-crown &mdash;and I ha&s;tened home, va&s;tly delighted with the acqui&s;ition. When my wi&s;e a&s;ked me where was our Chri&s;tmas dinner? I told her it was in my pocket.&mdash;"In your pock|et (&s;aid &s;he) that is a &s;trange place. How could you think of &s;tuffing a joint of meat into your pocket?" I a&s;&s;ured her that it would take no harm. But as I was in no ha&s;te to take it out, &s;he began to be more particular, and enquired what I had got, &amp;c. On which I began to harrangue on the &s;uperiority of intellectual plea&s;ures over &s;en&s;ual gratifications, and ob&s;erved that the brute creation enjoyed the latter in a much higher degree than man. And that a man,
<PB N="147" REF="030668_0145_0FE8592334A8E560">that was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of intellectual enjoy|ments was but a two-legged brute.</P>
<P>I was proceeding in this &s;train: "And &s;o (&s;aid &s;he) in&s;tead of buying a dinner, I &s;up|po&s;e you have, as you have done before, been buying <HI>books</HI> with the money?" I then confe&s;&s;ed I had bought Young's Night Thoughts: "And I think (&s;aid I) that I have acted wi&s;ely; for had I bought <HI>a din|ner,</HI> we &s;hould have eaten it to-morrow, and the plea&s;ure would have been &s;oon over, but &s;hould we live fifty years longer, we &s;hall have the <HI>Night Thoughts</HI> to fea&s;t upon." This was too powerful an argument to ad|mit of any further debate; in &s;hort, my wife was convinced. Down I &s;at, and began to read with as much enthu&s;ia&s;m as the good doctor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed when he wrote it; and &s;o much did it excite my attention as well as approbation, that I retained the greate&s;t part of it in my memory. A couplet of Per&s;ius, as Engli&s;hed, might have been ap|plied to me:
<Q><L>"&mdash;For this you gain tho&s;e meagre looks,</L>
<L>"And &s;acrifice your dinner to your books."</L></Q></P>
<P>Some time in June 1774, as we &s;at at work in our room, Mr. Boyd, one of Mr. We&s;ley's people, called and informed me that a little &s;hop and parlour were to be let
<PB N="148" REF="030668_0146_0FE8592C041F0208">in Feather&s;tone-&s;treet; adding, that if I was to take it, I might there get &s;ome work as a ma&s;ter. I without he&s;itation told him that I liked the idea, and hinted that I would &s;ell books al&s;o. Mr. Boyd then a&s;ked me how I came to think of &s;elling books? I in|formed him that until that moment it had never once entered into my thoughts; but that when he propo&s;ed my taking the &s;hop, it in&s;tantaneou&s;ly occurred to my mind, that for &s;everal months pa&s;t I had ob&s;erved a great increa&s;e in a certain old book &s;hop; and that I was per&s;uaded I knew as much of old books as the per&s;on who kept it. I farther ob&s;erved, that I loved books, and that if I could but be a book&s;eller, I &s;hould then have plenty of books to read, which was the greate&s;t motive I could conceive to induce me to make the attempt. My friend on this a&s;&s;ured me, that he would get the &s;hop for me, and with a laugh added, "when <HI>you</HI> are Lord Mayor, you &s;hall u&s;e all your intere&s;t to get <HI>me</HI> made an Alderman." Which I engaged not to forget to perform.</P>
<P>My <HI>private library</HI> at this time con&s;i&s;ted of Fletcher's Checks to Antinomiani&s;m, &amp;c. 5 volumes; Watt's Improvement of the Mind; Young's Night Thoughts; Wake's Tran&s;lation of the Apo&s;tolical Epi&s;tles; Fleetwook's Life of Chri&s;t; the fir&s;t twenty
<PB N="149" REF="030668_0147_0FE8592D91CF8E18">numbers of Hinton's Dictionary of the Arts and Sciences; &s;ome of We&s;ley's Journals, and &s;ome of the pious lives publi&s;hed by him; and about a dozen other volumes of the latter &s;ort, be&s;ides odd magazines, &amp;c. And to &s;et me up in &s;tile, Mr. Boyd recom|mended me to the friends of an holy brother lately gone to heaven, and of them I pur|cha&s;ed a bagful of old books, chiefly divi|nity, for a guinea.</P>
<P>With this &s;tock, and &s;ome odd &s;craps of leather, which together with all my books were worth about five pounds, I opened &s;hop on mid&s;ummer-day, 1774, in Feather|&s;tone-&s;treet, in the pari&s;h of St. Luke; and I was as well plea&s;ed in &s;urveying my little &s;hop with my name over it, as was Nebu|chadnezzar, when he &s;aid "Is not this great Babylon that I have built?" and my good wife often perceiving the plea&s;ure that I took in my &s;hop, piou&s;ly cautioned me a|gain&s;t &s;etting my mind on the riches of this world, and a&s;&s;ured me that it was all but va|nity. "You are very right, my dear (I &s;ometimes r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">plied) and to keep our minds as &s;piritual as we can, we will always attend our cla&s;s and band meetings, hear as many &s;ermons, &amp;c. at the Foundery on week days as po&s;&s;ible, and on &s;abbath days we will

<P>NOtwith&s;tanding the ob&s;curity of the &s;treet, and the mean appear|ance of my &s;hop, yet I &s;oon found cu&s;tom|ers for what few books I had, and I as &s;oon laid out the money in other old tra&s;h which was daily brought for &s;ale.</P>
<P>At that time Mr. We&s;ley's people had a &s;um of money which was kept on purpo&s;e to lend out, for three months, without inte|re&s;t to &s;uch of their &s;ociety who&s;e characters were good, and who wanted a temporary relief. To increa&s;e my little &s;tock, I bor|rowed five pounds out of this fund, which was of great &s;ervice to me.</P>
<P>In our new &s;ituation we lived in a very frugal manner, often dining on potatoes, and quenching our thir&s;t with water, being ab&s;o|lutely determined if po&s;&s;ible to make &s;ome provi&s;ion for &s;uch di&s;mal times as &s;ickne&s;s, &s;hortne&s;s of work, &amp;c. which we had been &s;o frequently involved in before, and could &s;carce help expecting to be our fate again.

<P>This immen&s;e &s;tock I deemed too valuable to be buried in Feather&s;tone-&s;treet; and a &s;hop and parlour being to let in Chi&s;well-&s;treet, No. 46, I took them. This was at that time, and for fourteen years afterwards a very dull and ob&s;cure &s;ituation: as few ever pa&s;&s;ed through it, be&s;ides Spitalfield weavers on <HI>hanging days,</HI> and methodi&s;ts <HI>on preaching nights;</HI> but &s;till it was much better adapted for bu&s;ine&s;s than Feather|&s;tone-&s;treet.</P>
<P>A few weeks after I came into Chilwell-&s;treet, I bade a final adieu to the <HI>gentle cra&s;t,</HI> and converted my little &s;tock of leather, &amp;c. into old books; and a great &s;ale I had, con|&s;idering my &s;tock; which was not only ex|tremely &s;mall, but contained very little va|riety, as it principally con&s;i&s;ted of divinity; for as I had not much knowledge, &s;o I &s;el|dom ventured out of my depth.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Friend of mine, of who&s;e veracity I entertain the highe&s;t opini|on, has favoured me with an account of a lady, who has to the full as much, indeed more of the &s;pirit, but without the good|nature of Nancy Lackington. The fact is as follows:</P>
<L>"'Tis true 'tis pity: and pity 'tis it's true."</L>
<P>Mr. R&mdash;t, a genteel trade&s;man with whom I am acquainted, having lo&s;t his &s;econd wife early in 1790, courted and married one of the holy &s;i&s;ters a few months after|wards. They had lived together about &s;ix months, when Mr. R&mdash;t, one Sunday, be|ing a &s;ober religious man, took down Dod|dridge's Lectures, and began to read them to his wife and family. But this holy &s;i&s;|ter found fault with her hu&s;band for reading &s;uch learned rational di&s;cour&s;es, which fa|voured too much of human rea&s;on and vain
<PB N="156" REF="030668_0154_0FE8594F70EB0A70">philo&s;ophy, and wi&s;hed he would read &s;omething more &s;piritual and edifying. He attempted to convince her that Dr. Dod|dridge was not only a good rational divine, but to the full as &s;piritual as any divine ought to be; and that to be more &s;piritual he mu&s;t be le&s;s rational, and of cour&s;e be|come fanatical and vi&s;ionary. But the&s;e ob&s;ervations of the hu&s;band &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed his &s;piritual wife, that &s;he retired to bed, and left her hu&s;band to read Doddridge's Lec|tures as long as he cho&s;e to his children by a former wife.</P>
<P>The next morning while Mr. R&mdash;t was out on bu&s;ine&s;s, this holy &s;i&s;ter, without &s;aying one &s;yllable to any per&s;on, packed up all her clothes, crammed them into a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hackney coach, and away &s;he went. Mr. R&mdash;t, poor &s;oul! on coming home di&s;co|vered his immen&s;e lo&s;s, and in an almo&s;t frantic &s;tate, &s;pent the fir&s;t fortnight in fruit le&s;s attempts to di&s;cover her retreat.</P>
<P><Q>Three weeks after her elopement, was (&s;ays Mr R&mdash;t) going down Cheap &s;ide one day, and &s;aw a lady &s;omething like my wife, but as &s;he was &s;omewhat di&s;gui&s;ed and I could not &s;ee her face, was not &s;ure. At la&s;t I ventured to look under her bonnet and &s;ound, that, &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> enough, it was &s;he. I then walked thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="157" REF="030668_0155_0FE8595102CDD1B8">times backwards and forwards in Cheap|&s;ide, endeavouring to per&s;uade her to re|turn with me or to di&s;cover where &s;he lived: but &s;he ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to re|turn, or to let me &s;ee her retreat; and here (&s;ays Mr. R&mdash;t) I begged that &s;he would grant me a ki&s;s; but &s;he would not willingly. However after &s;ome bu&s;|tle in the &s;treet, I took a farewell ki&s;s. Poor dear &s;oul! (&s;igh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d he) &s;he is rather <HI>too &s;piritual!</HI> for notwith&s;tanding I laid by her &s;ide near &s;ix months, &s;he never would be prevailed upon to do any thing carnal; and although I did all in my power to get the better of her &s;piritual &s;cruples, yet &s;he was always &s;o in love with Chri&s;t her heavenly &s;pou&s;e, that when &s;he eloped from me, &s;he was, I a&s;|&s;ure you, as good a virgin as when I mar|ried her.</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t give you one more &s;tory of the &s;ame nature with the preceding.</P>
<P>A gentleman of London happening to be on a vi&s;it at Bri&s;tol about three years &s;ince, fell in love with a hand&s;ome young lady who was one of the holy &s;i&s;terhood; after a few weeks acquaintance he made her an offer of his per&s;on and fortune, and the young lady after proper enquiry had been

<P>BECAUSE &s;ome of the holy &s;i&s;ters are in their amours altoge|ther &s;piritual, you are by no means to un|der&s;tand
<PB N="161" REF="030668_0159_0FE85962EABB4908">that they are all totally dive&s;ted of the carnal propen&s;ity.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e good creatures are &s;o far from thinking that their hu&s;bands are too carnal in their affections, that they really think that they are not enough &s;o; and in|&s;tances are not wanting, in which, owing to their having hu&s;bands too &s;piritual, they have been willing to receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the hu&s;bands of other women.</P>
<P>It is but about a year &s;ince a certain cele|brated preacher u&s;ed to admini&s;ter carnal con&s;olation to the wife of his clerk. This holy communication was repeated &s;o often, and &s;o open, that at la&s;t it came to the clerk's ears, who watching an opportunity, one day &s;urpri&s;ed the pious pair at their <HI>devotion,</HI> and &s;o <HI>belaboured</HI> the preacher with his walking|&s;taff, that the public were for near a month deprived of the benefits re&s;ulting from his remarkable gift of eloquence.</P>
<P>As I am got into the &s;tory-telling way, I cannot re&s;i&s;t the temptation of telling ano|ther.</P>
<P>A certain holy &s;i&s;ter who lately kept a hou&s;e in a country village, within ten miles of London; and <HI>took in</HI> (as they called it) Mr. We&s;leys preachers, by taking <HI>in</HI> is only meant, that when they came in their turn to
<PB N="162" REF="030668_0160_0FE8596A1B41DFF0">preach in the village &s;he u&s;ed to &s;upply each with victuals and a bed; (<HI>no doubt</HI> but they &s;lept <HI>alone.</HI>) This lady was &s;o very remark|able for her <HI>&s;piritual experience</HI> and divine gifts, that &s;he attracted many to her hou&s;e, be&s;ides &s;uch as came in the regular cour&s;e of their duty, and among the former a preacher from London, from whom I learnt the affair. This preacher happening to want a wife, and being very &s;piritually-minded, actually married her in December 1790, merely for her great gifts and grace, as her fortune was not above the fiftieth part as much as his own; and as to per&s;on, &s;he is &s;carce one degree above ugline&s;s it&s;elf; al|though her hu&s;band is well-proportioned, and upon the whole a hand&s;ome man. They had not been married a week, when this &s;im|ple preacher di&s;covered that his gifted gra|cious &s;aint was an incarnate devil, who had married him only to job, plunder, and &mdash;him, and in a few months between her and her gallants, they bullied him out of a &s;ettlement to the amount of four times the &s;um &s;he brought him, and the poor pious preacher thinks that he has cheaply got rid of her.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER a long di|gre&s;&s;ion, I mu&s;t now return to my own af|fairs.</P>
<P>I continued in the above-mentioned dreadful fever many weeks, and my life was de&s;paired of by all that came near me. Dur|ing which time, my wife, whom I affection|ately loved, died and was buried, without my once having a &s;ight of her. What ad|ded much to my misfortunes, &s;everal nur&s;es that were hired to take care of me and my wife, proved &s;o abandoned and depraved as to have lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of moral obligation, and every tender feeling for one who to all appearance was ju&s;t on the point of death: &s;everal of the&s;e mon&s;ters in female &s;hape robbed my drawers of linen, &amp;c. and kept them&s;elves drunk with gin, while I lay un|able to move in my bed, and was ready to peri&s;h, partly owing to want of cleanline&s;s and proper care. Thus &s;ituated, I mu&s;t in|evitably have fallen a victim, had it not been for my &s;i&s;ter Dorothy, wife of Mr. Northam of Lambeth, and my &s;i&s;ter Eliza|beth wife of Mr. Bell in Soho. The&s;e kind &s;i&s;ters, as &s;oon as they were informed of he deplorable &s;tate in which I lay, not|with&s;tanding &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding which
<PB N="168" REF="030668_0166_0FE8598D696D31B0">&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us, and prevented me from &s;ending for them, ha&s;tened to me and each &s;at up with me alternately, &s;o that I had one or the other with me every night; and, contrary to all expectation, I recovered. But this recovery was in a very &s;low man|ner.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was able to enquire into the &s;tate of my affairs, I found that Mr. Whee|ler, &s;ack and rope-maker in Old-&s;treet, and Me&s;&s;rs. Bottomley and Shaw, carpenters and &s;a&s;h-makers in Bunhill-row, had &s;aved me from ruin, by locking up my &s;hop, which contained my little <HI>all.</HI> Had not this been done, the nur&s;es would no doubt have con|trived means to have emptied my &s;hop, as effectually as they had done my drawers.</P>
<P>The above gentlemen not only took care of my &s;hop, but al&s;o advanced money to pay &s;uch expences as occurred: and as my wife was dead, they a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making my will in favour of my mother.</P>
<P>The&s;e worthy gentlemen belong to Mr. We&s;ley's &s;ociety (and notwith&s;tanding they have imbibed many enthu&s;ia&s;tic whims) yet would they be an honour to any &s;ociety, and are a credit to human nature. I hope that I never &s;hall recollect their kindne&s;s with|out being filled with the warme&s;t &s;entiments of gratitude towards them.</P>

<P>On my recovery I al&s;o learnt that Mi&s;s Dorcas Turton (the young woman that kept the hou&s;e, and of whom I then rented the &s;hop, parlour, kitchen and garret) having out of kindne&s;s to my wife, occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;i&s;ted her during her illne&s;s, had caught the &s;ame dreadful di&s;order, &s;he was then very dangerou&s;ly ill, and people &s;hunned the hou&s;e as much as if the plague had been in it. So that when I opened my &s;hop again, I was &s;tared at as though I had actually re|turned from the other world; and it was a con&s;iderable time before many of my former cu&s;tomers could credit that I really was in exi&s;tence, it having been repeatedly report|ed that I was dead.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Dorcas Turton, was a charming young woman, and you mu&s;t now be made farther acquainted with her. She is the daughter of Mr. Samuel Turton of Stafford-&s;hire; her mother by marriage, &s;till retained her maiden name, which was Mi&s;s Jemima
<PB N="170" REF="030668_0168_0FE859966561C748">Turton, of Oxford&s;hire. Mr. Samuel Tur|ton had a large fortune of his own, and a|bout twenty thou&s;and pounds with his wife Mi&s;s Jemima, but by an unhappy turn for gaming he di&s;&s;ipated nearly the whole of it, and was obliged to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecour&s;e to trade to help &s;upport his family.</P>
<Q><L>"'Tis lo&s;t at dice, what ancient honour won,</L>
<L>"Hard, when the father plays away the &s;on!</L></Q>
<P>He opened a &s;hop as a &s;addlers ironmon|ger, but as he was but little acquainted with trade, and as his old propen&s;ity to gaming never quitted him, it is no wonder that he did not &s;ucceed in his bu&s;ine&s;s; and to crown all his other follies, he was bound for a fal&s;e friend in a large &s;um; this completed his ruin.</P>
<P>His wife died in Jan. 1773 and his final ruin en&s;ued a few months after; &s;o that from that time to his death he was partly &s;uppor|ted by his daughter Mi&s;s Dorcas Turton, who cheerfully &s;ubmitted to keep a &s;chool, and worked very hard at plain work, by which means &s;he kept her father from want. The old gentleman died a few months after I came into the &s;hop. Being partly ac|quainted with this young lady's goodne&s;s to her father, I concluded that &s;o amiable a daughter was very likely to make a good

<PB N="174" REF="030668_0172_0FE8599F3116BDF0">of this whim&s;ical, &s;en&s;ible, plea&s;ing work; it was written by Thomas Amory, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> (who was living in the year 1788, at the great age of 97) and I know not of any work more proper to be put into the hands of a poor ignorant bigotted &s;uper&s;titious method|i&s;t; but the misfortune is, that &s;carce one of them will read any thing but what &s;uits with their own narrow notions, &s;o that they &s;hut them&s;elves up in darkne&s;s, and exclude every ray of intellectual light; which puts me in mind of the enthu&s;ia&s;ts on the banks of the Ganges, who will not look at any thing beyond the tip of their mo&s;es.

<P>I al&s;o received great benefit from reading Coventry's Philemon to Hyda&s;pes; it con|&s;i&s;ts of dialogues on fal&s;e religion, extrava|gant devotion, &amp;c. in which are many very curious remarks on vi&s;ionaries of various ages and &s;ects. The works is complete in five parts octavo. There has al&s;o been a decent Scotch edition, publi&s;hed in twelves, both editions are now rather &s;carce.</P>
<P>I now began to enjoy many innocent plea&s;ures and recreations in life, without the fear of being eternally damn'd for a laugh,
<PB N="175" REF="030668_0173_0FE85893C9F3C678">a joke, or for &s;pending a &s;ociable evening with a few friends, going to the play-hou&s;e, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>In &s;hort I &s;aw that true religion was no way incompatible with, or an enemy to ra|tional plea&s;ures of any kind. As life (&s;ays one) is the gift of heaven, it is religion to enjoy it.</P>

<P>I now al&s;o began to read with great plea|&s;ure the rational and moderate divines of all denominations: and a year or two after I began with metaphy&s;ics, in the intricate though plea&s;ing labyrinths of which I have occa&s;ionally &s;ince wandered, nor am I ever likely to find my way out.</P>

<P>I am not in the lea&s;t unea&s;y on that head, as I have no doubt of being in my la&s;t mo|ments able to adopt the language of one of the greate&s;t men that ever exi&s;ted:
<Q><L>"Great God, who&s;e being by thy works is known,</L>

<L>"And cannot think the God who being gave.</L>
<L>"The God who&s;e favours made my bli&s;s o'erflow,</L>
<L>"Has doom'd me, after death, to endle&s;s woe,"</L></Q></P>
<P>In the mean time I can &s;incerely adopt the following lines of Mr. Pope.</P>
<Q><L>"If I am right, thy grace impart,</L>
<L>"Still in the right to &s;tay;</L>
<L>"If I am wrong! O teach my heart,</L>
<L>"To find the better way."</L></Q>
<P>Having begun to think rationally, and rea&s;on freely on religious matters, you may be &s;ure I did not long remain in Mr. We&s;|ley's &s;ociety. What is remarkable, I well remember that &s;ome years before, Mr. Wel|ley told his &s;ociety in Broadmead, Bri&s;tol, in my hearing, that he could never keep a book&s;eller &s;ix months in his &s;tock, (all fana|tics are enemies to rea&s;on.) He was then pointing out the danger that attended clo&s;e rea&s;oning in matters of religion and &s;piritual concerns, in reading controver&s;ies, &amp;c, at that time I had not the lea&s;t idea of my ever becoming a book&s;eller: but I no &s;ooner began to give &s;cope to my rea&s;oning facul|ties than the above remarkable a&s;&s;ertion oc|curred to my mind.</P>
<P>But that which rather ha&s;tened my de|parture from methodi&s;m was this. The
<PB N="177" REF="030668_0175_0FE859A0C14DBD80">methodi&s;t preachers were continually repro|bating the practice of ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es keeping &s;ervants at home on Sundays, to dre&s;s dinners, which prevented them from hearing the word of God (by the word of God they mean their own jargon of non|&s;en&s;e) a&s;&s;uring them if the &s;ouls of &s;uch &s;er|vants were damned, they might in a great mea&s;ure lay their damnation at the doors of &s;uch ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who rather than eat a cold dinner, would be guilty of break|ing the &s;abbath, and ri&s;king the &s;ouls of their &s;ervants. But how great was my &s;ur|prize on di&s;covering that the&s;e very men who were continually preaching up fa&s;ting, ab&s;tinence, &amp;c. to their congregations, and who wanted others to dine off cold dinners, or eat bread and chee&s;e, &amp;c. would them|&s;elves not even <HI>&s;up,</HI> without roa&s;ted fowls, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This I found to be fact, as I &s;everal times had occa&s;ion after attending the preaching to go into the kitchen hehind the <HI>old Foun|dery,</HI> (which at that time was Mr. We&s;ley's preaching hou&s;e) there I &s;aw women who had been kept from hearing the &s;ermon, &amp;c. they being employed in roa&s;ting fowls, and otherwi&s;e providing good &s;uppers for the preachers.</P>
<P>"So," &s;aid I, "you lay burthens on
<PB N="178" REF="030668_0176_0FE859A7EB2E2B30">other men's &s;houlders, but will not &s;o much as touch them your&s;elves with one of your &s;ingers."</P>
<P>A ridiculous in&s;tance of the &s;ame nature happened al&s;o &s;ome years &s;ince at Taunton. One of Mr. We&s;ley's preachers, who&s;e name was Cotterrell, a&s;&s;ured his congregation from time to time, that every baker that bak|ed meat on Sundays would be damned, and every per&s;on that partook of &s;uch meat would al&s;o be damned; on which a poor baker &s;hut up his oven on Sundays; the con&s;equence was that he lo&s;t his cu&s;tomers, as &s;uch bakers as baked their victuals on Sunday, had their cu&s;tom on other days, &s;o that the poor baker's family was nearly re|duced to the workhou&s;e; when one Sunday pa&s;&s;ing before the door where he knew the preacher was to dine, he was very much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a baked leg of pork carri|ed into the hou&s;e, and after a few minutes reflections he ru&s;hed in and found the pious preacher eating part of the baked leg of pork, on which he bid farewell to the me|thodi&s;ts, and again took care for his family.</P>
<P>It perhaps is worth remarking, that many poor hair-dre&s;&s;ers in Mr. We&s;ley's &s;ociety are reduced to extreme poverty, they can|not get employment, as they will not dre&s;s hair on Sundays; and I find that a poor
<PB N="179" REF="030668_0177_0FE859A978A09118">milk woman, who until the beginning of this year 1792, maintained her family in a decent manner, was lately frightened out of her under&s;tanding by a methodi&s;t preacher; her crime was the &s;elling milk on Sundays. The poor wretch is now confined in Bed|lam, and her five children are in a work|hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I at this time know a book&s;eller, who being a methodi&s;t, is &s;o con&s;cientious as to have his hair dre&s;&s;ed on the evening of every Saturday, and to prevent its being di&s;com|po&s;ed in the night, he on tho&s;e nights al|ways &s;leeps in his elbow chair. Indeed &s;ome tell the &s;tory different, and &s;ay, that his hair is dre&s;&s;ed on Saturday morning, and by &s;leeping in his chair he &s;aves the expence of dre&s;&s;ing on Sundays; others &s;ay, that the fir&s;t is the fact, and that he hinted at it in his &s;hop-bills, in order that the public may know where to find a trade&s;man that had a very tender con&s;cience.</P>
<P>I was one day called a&s;ide and a hand-bill was given me, and thinking it to be a quack doctor's bill for a certain di&s;ea&s;e, I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urpri&s;e at its being given to me in &s;uch a particular manner; but on reading it I found it contained a part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">lar account of the wonderful conver&s;ion of a John Biggs, when he was twenty-one years of age. Mr.

I keep this bill as a curio&s;ity.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had no &s;ooner left Mr. We&s;ley's &s;ociety, and began to talk a little more like a rational being, but I found that I had incurred the hatred of &s;ome, the pity of others, the envy of many, and the di&s;plea&s;ure of <HI>all</HI> Mr. We&s;ley's&mdash;<HI>old women!</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="030668_0179_0FE859B230814068">So that for a long time I was con&s;tantly tea&s;ed with their impertinent non&s;en&s;e. I believe that never was a poor devil &s;o plagued.</P>

<P>Some as they pa&s;&s;ed by my door in their way to the foundery would only make a &s;top and lift up their hands, turn up the whites of their eyes, &s;hake their heads, groan, and pa&s;s on. Many would call in and take me a&s;ide, and after making rueful faces, ad|dre&s;s me with, "O, Brother Lackington! I am very &s;orry to find that you who began in the &s;pirit are now like to end in the fle&s;h. Pray brother, do remember Lot's wife.' Another would interrupt me in my bu&s;ine&s;s, to tell me, that, "he that putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh back, is unfit for the kingdom." Another had ju&s;t called as he was pa&s;&s;ing by, to caution me again&s;t the bewitching &s;nares of pro&s;perity. Others again called to know if I was as happy then as I was when I con&s;tantly &s;ought the Lord with my brethren, in prayer meeting, in cla&s;s, in band, &amp;c. When I a&s;&s;ured them that I was more happy, they in a very &s;o|lemn
<PB N="182" REF="030668_0180_0FE859B9631523E0">manner a&s;&s;ured me, that I was under a very great delu&s;ion of the devil; and when I by chance happened to laugh at their enthu&s;ia&s;tic rant, &s;ome have run out of my &s;hop, declaring that they were afraid to &s;tay under the &s;ame roof with me, le&s;t the hou&s;e &s;hould fall on their heads. Some|times I have been acco&s;ted in &s;uch an a|larming manner as though the hou&s;e was on fire, with "Oh! brother! brother! you are fa&s;t a&s;leep! and the flames of hell are taking hold of you!"</P>
<P>A certain preacher a&s;&s;ured me, in the pre|&s;ence of &s;everal gentlemen, that the devil would &s;oon to&s;s me about in the flames of hell with a pitch&s;ork. This &s;ame eloquene mild preacher u&s;ed occa&s;ionally to &s;trip to his &s;hirt to <HI>dodge</HI> the devil.</P>
<P>Mr. E. a gentleman of my acquaintance, going through &s;ome alley, one Sunday, hear|ing a very uncommon noi&s;e, was led by curio&s;ity to the hou&s;e from whence it pro|ceeded, and there he &s;aw elevated above an a&s;&s;embly of old women, &amp;c. this taylor, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ript in his &s;hirt, with his wig off and the collar of his &s;hirt unbuttoned, &s;weating, foaming at the mouth, and bellowing like a baited bull.

<P>Some of the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> &s;aints a&s;&s;ured me, that I never had one grain of &s;aving grace, and that when I thought my&s;elf a child of God, I was only deluded by the devil, who being now quite &s;ure of me, did not think it worth his while to deceive me any longer. Others advi&s;ed me to take care of &s;inning again&s;t light and knowledge, and piou&s;ly hoped that it was not quite <HI>too late;</HI> that I had not (they hoped) committed the <HI>unpar|donable</HI> &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t. Others again, who happened to be in a better hu|mour, often told'me that they &s;hould &s;ee me brought back to the true &s;heepfold, as they really hoped I had once been in a &s;tate of grace, and if &s;o, that I always was in grace, in &s;pite of all I could do: the Lord would never quit his hold of me; that I might fall <HI>foully,</HI> but that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to fall <HI>finally,</HI> as in the end I &s;hould be brought, back on the &s;houlders of the everla&s;ting go&s;|pel, for when God came to number his jewels, not one would be mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e righteous men, after pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome encomiums on me for my moral cha|racter, a&s;&s;ured me that I had by no means fallen &s;o law as many of God's dear children
<PB N="184" REF="030668_0182_0FE859C277118CA8">had fallen, but fall as low as they po&s;&s;ibly can, &s;aid he, they are &s;till God's children, for although they may "be black with &s;in they are fair within" He then read to me the following pa&s;&s;age out of a pamphlet writ|ten again&s;t Mr. Fletcher by Mr. R. Hill. <Q>David &s;tood as completely ju&s;tified in the everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, at the time when he cau&s;ed Uriah to be murdered, and was committing adultery with his wife, as he was in any part of his life. For all the &s;ins of the elect, be they more or be they le&s;s, be they pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, or to come, were forever done away. So that every one of tho&s;e <HI>elect</HI> &s;tand &s;potle&s;s in the &s;ight of God.</Q> Is not this a very comfortable kind of doc|trine? The pernicious con&s;equences of &s;uch tenets impre&s;&s;ed on the minds of the ignorant followers of the&s;e quacks in reli|gion, mu&s;t be obvious to every per&s;on ca|pable of reflection. They have nothing to do but to enli&s;t them&s;elves in the band of the elect, and no matter then how criminal their life!</P>
<P>Thus, my dear friend, I was for a long time coaxed by &s;ome, threatened with all the tortures of the damned by others, and con&s;tantly teazed &s;ome how or other by all the methodi&s;ts who came near me.</P>

<P>I at la&s;t determined to laugh at all their ridiculous perver&s;ions of the &s;cripture, and their &s;piritual cant. The con&s;equence (as might be expected) was, they piou&s;ly and charitably con&s;igned me over to be torment|ed by the devil, and every where declared that I was turned a downright athei&s;t.

My reply has been uniformly in the negative. I am certain that they are not in general &s;o. The major part of them indeed are very ignorant (as is the ca&s;e with enthu&s;ia&s;ts of every religion) but I believe that a great number of the methodi&s;ts are &s;in|cere, hone&s;t, friendly people; in ju&s;tice to tho&s;e of that de&s;cription it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that many artful, &s;ly, de&s;igning per&s;ons, having noticed their character, connections, &amp;c. and knowing that a reli|gious per&s;on is in general &s;uppo&s;ed to be hone&s;t and con&s;cientious, have been induc|ed to join their &s;ocieties, and by a&s;&s;uming an appearance of extraordinary &s;anctity, have the better been enabled to cheat and defraud &s;uch as were not guarded again&s;t their hypocritical wiles.</P>

<P>I have al&s;o rea&s;on to belleve that there are not a few, who think that they can as it were afford to cheat and defraud, on the &s;core of having right notions of religion in their heads, hearing what they deem ortho|dox teachers, going to prayer meetings, &amp;c.</P>

There are again others who think, that grace is &s;o free and &s;o ea&s;y to be had, or in other words, that as they can have pardon for all kinds of &s;ins, and that at any time whenever they plea&s;e, they under this idea make very little con&s;cience of running up large &s;cores, to which practice I fear &s;uch doctrines as I noticed in my la&s;t, from the pen of Mr. Hill, have not a little contri|buted.</P>
<P>I have often thought that great hurt has been done to &s;ociety by the methodi&s;t preach|ers, both in town and country, attending condemned malefactors, as by their fanatical conver&s;ation, vi&s;ionary hymns, bold and impious applications of the &s;criptures, &amp;c. many dreadful offenders again&s;t law and ju&s;|tice, have had their pa&s;&s;ions and imagina|tions &s;o worked upon, that they have been &s;ent to the other world in &s;uch raptures, as would better become martyrs innocently &s;uffering in a glorious cau&s;e, than criminals of the fir&s;t magnitude.</P>
<P>A great number of narratives of the&s;e &s;udden conver&s;ions and triumphant exits have been compiled, many of them publi&s;h|ed, and circulated with the greate&s;t avidity, to the private emolument of the editors, and doubtle&s;s to the great edification of all &s;iuners, long habituated to a cour&s;e of vil|lainous

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is very remarkable that while I was writing the la&s;t five lines of my former letter to you, on Wedne&s;day the 2d of March 1791, I reccived the news of the death of Mr. John We&s;ley, who I am informed, died that morning at his own hou&s;e, in the city-road, Moorfields, in the eighty-eighth year of his age. He had no illne&s;s, but the wheels of the machine being worn out, it &s;topt of cour&s;e. As I am on the &s;ubject of methodi&s;in, I hope you will not deem it impertinent, if I devote a few lines to this great parent of a numerous &s;ect, whom I well knew, and feel a plea&s;ure in &s;peaking of with &s;ome re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Several days preceding his interment, be|ing laid in his coffin, in his gown and band, he was expo&s;ed to the view of all who came, and the public; and I &s;uppo&s;e that forty or fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons had a &s;ight of him. But the concour&s;e of people was &s;o great, that many were glad to get out of the crowd without &s;eeing him at all; and although a number of con&s;tables were pre&s;ent, yet the pick-pockets contrived to ea&s;e many of their pur&s;es, watches, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible the dread|ful
<PB N="194" REF="030668_0192_0FE859EEB526EF00">effects of a mob, he was interred on Wedne&s;day, March the 9th, between five and &s;ix o'clock in the morning, in the buri|al ground behind his own chapel in the city-road. After which Dr. Whitehead (the phy&s;ician) preached his funeral &s;ermon, but notwith&s;tanding the early hour, many thou&s;ands attended more than the chapel would hold, although it is very large.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was known that Mr. We&s;ley was decea&s;ed, a number of needy brethren deemed it a fair opportunity of pro&s;iting by it, and each immediately &s;et his ingenuity to work to compo&s;e what he cho&s;e to call a <HI>life</HI> of him; and for &s;ome weeks &s;ince the fune|ral the chapel-yard and its vicinity has exhi|bited a truly ludicrous &s;cene, on every night of preaching, owing to the different writers and venders of the&s;e ha&s;ty perform|ances exerting them&s;elves to &s;ecure a good &s;ale; one bawling out, that <HI>his</HI> is the <HI>right</HI> life, a &s;econd with apious &s;hake of the head, declares <HI>his</HI> the real life, a third prote&s;ts <HI>he</HI> has got the <HI>only genuine</HI> account; and a &s;ourth calls them all vile chea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and impo&s;|tors, &amp;c. &s;o that between all the&s;e competi|tors, the &s;aints are &s;o divided and perplexed in their opinious, that &s;ome decline purcha&s;|ing either; others willing "to try all, and keep that which is good," buy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of

<P>I cannot help thinking that Mr. John We&s;ley, the father of the methodi&s;ts, was one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable enthu&s;ia&s;ts that ever lived; as it is generally thought that he believed all that he taught others, and lived the fame pious exemplary life, that he would have his followers practi&s;e. The &s;ale of his numerous writings produced nett profits to the amount of near TWO THOU|SAND POUNDS per annum; and the weekly collection of the cla&s;&s;es in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter amounted to a very large &s;um; be&s;ides this, great &s;ums were collected, at the &s;acraments and love fea&s;ts, for quarter|ly tickets, private and public &s;ub&s;criptions, &amp;c. &amp;c. In a pamphlet which was pub|li&s;hed in the beginning of this year 1792, by an old member of their &s;ociety, it is a&s;|&s;erted that for the la&s;t ten years, the &s;ums
<PB N="196" REF="030668_0194_0FE859F4EE9848A0">collected in Great Britain and Ireland, have amounted to no le&s;s than FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS per annum. Be&s;ides the above, many private collections are made in all his &s;ocieties throughout the three kingdoms, &s;o that Mr. We&s;ley might have ama&s;&s;ed an immen&s;e fortune, had riches been his object. But in&s;tead of accumu|lating wealth, he expended all his own pri|vate property; and I have been often in|formed, from good authority, that he never denied relief to a poor per&s;on that a&s;ked him. To needy trade&s;men I have known him to give ten or twenty pounds at once. In going a few yards from his &s;tudy to the pulpit, he generally gave away an handful of half-crowns to poor old people of his &s;ociety. He was indeed charitable to an extreme, as he often gave to unworthy ob|jects, nor would he keep money &s;ufficient to hold out on his journies. One of his friends informs me that he left but &pound;4 10<ABBR>s.</ABBR> behind him; and I have heard him declare that he would not die worth twenty pounds, except his books for &s;ale, which he has left to the "general methodi&s;t fund, for carry|ing on the work of God, by itinerant preach|ers," charged only with a rent of eighty-five pounds a year, which he has left to the wife and children of his brother Charles.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="030668_0195_0FE859F934430358">
His learning and great abilities are well known. But I cannot help noticing that in one of his publications (&s;tepping out of his line) he betrayed extreme weakne&s;s and cre|dulity, though no doubt his intentions were good. What I allude to is his <HI>"Primitive Phy&s;ic,"</HI> a work certainly of a dangerous tendency, as the majority of remedies there|in pre&s;cribed are mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly inefficaci|ous, and many of them very dangerous, if admini&s;tered. The con&s;equence of the fir&s;t is, that while poor ignorant people are try|ing the&s;e remedies (be&s;ides the very great probability of their mi&s;taking the ca&s;e) the di&s;ea&s;es perhaps become &s;o inveterate as to re&s;i&s;t the power of more efficacious reme|dies properly applied, and with regard to tho&s;e of a highly dangerous nature, how ra&s;h to tru&s;t them in the hands of &s;uch un|informed people as this book was almo&s;t &s;olely intended for, e&s;pecially when &s;ancti|oned by the name of an author who&s;e in|fluence impre&s;&s;ed the minds of the unfortu|nate patients with the mo&s;t powerful convic|tion.

<P>A very worthy phy&s;ician to whom the community is highly indebted for his inde|fatigable and &s;ucce&s;sful exertions in the cau&s;e of humanity, publi&s;hed &s;ome very ju|dicious "Remarks on the Primitive Phy|&s;ic," which however, for obvious rea&s;ons, were not &s;o generally noticed as the &s;ubject de&s;erved; as almo&s;t all the admirers of Mr. We&s;ley's work con&s;i&s;ted of his followers (&s;ufficiently numerous indeed to in&s;ure a very exten&s;ive &s;ale) the&s;e were too bigoted to conde&s;cend to peru&s;e any production tending to enlighten their under&s;tandings; and the public at large, not having paid much attention to it, did not conceive them|&s;elves &s;o materially intere&s;ted in the "Re|marks," though I am firmly of opinion, if they are peru&s;ed with that candour with which they appear to be written, they will have a very beneficial tendency in guarding the public again&s;t the mi&s;chief too frequent|ly ari&s;ing from the "Primitive Phy&s;ic," and other quack publications, as ab&s;urd as they are injurious.</P>
<P>Permit me ju&s;t to give you one &s;pecimen
<PB N="199" REF="030668_0197_0FE85A024294C440">of the author's wonderful abilities, by quot|ing a receipt, which if not an <HI>infallible reme|dy,</HI> mu&s;t at lea&s;t be acknowledged to be a &s;ingular one.</P>

<P>Should you, my dear friend, be de&s;irous of peru&s;ing a variety of remedies, not equal|ly <HI>judicious</HI> as well as <HI>efficacious</HI> with tho&s;e of Mr. We&s;ley, you will meet with ample &s;atisfaction by turning to <HI>"Dom Pernety's Voyage to the Falkland I&s;lands,"</HI> page 153 to 162, quarto edition.</P>
<P>Some of the receipts there in&s;erted are &s;o truly <HI>curious,</HI> I can &s;carce refrain from treat|ing you with a &s;pecimen or two, but being at the &s;ame time not <HI>very</HI> delicate, I mu&s;t decline in&s;erting them, for like Simpkin,</P>

<P>Should you, however, deem it worth the trouble of turning to the volume, I am con|fident the &s;ubject mu&s;t excite a &s;mile at the amazing credulity of the writer, as well as his folly in expofing &s;uch wretched tra&s;h to the public eye, indeed I can hardly per&s;uade my&s;elf he could be &s;erious when he wrote them.</P>
<P>The two following receipts I mu&s;t give

I &s;ear le&s;t I have be&s;towed on you labour in vain, I therefore decline quoting any more of tho&s;e extracrdinary remedies.</P>
<P>It was a circumliance pecularly happy for the practitioncrs of phy&s;ic, though no doubt a terrible misfortune to the public, that the di&s;&s;erence in religious principles of the&s;e two reverend gentlemen proved an effectual bar to the union of their medical obilities, which appear &s;o exactly cone&s;pon|dent; had &s;uch an event taken place, that

The Rev. Dr. Fordyce, in a late publica|tion has al&s;o given the world a remedy for the cramp, as <HI>delicate</HI> as efficacious.</P>
<P>What a pity that &s;uch a character as Mr. We&s;ley &s;hould have been a dupe and a rank enthu&s;ia&s;t! A believer in dreams, vi&s;ions, immediate revelations, miraculous cures, witchcraft, and many other ridiculous ab&s;ur|dities, as appears from many pa&s;&s;ages of his Journals, to the great di&s;grace of his abilities and learning; which puts me in mind of Sir I&s;aac Newton's Expo&s;ition of the Reve|lations, Milton's Paradi&s;e Regained, Dr. John&s;on's unmanly Devotions, &amp;c. &amp;c. However, we may &s;a&s;ely affirm that Mr. We&s;ley was a good &s;incere and hone&s;t one, who denied him&s;elf many things; and real|ly thought that he di&s;regarded the prai&s;e and blame of the world, when he was more courted, re&s;pected, and followed than any man living, and he ruled over a hundred and twenty thou&s;and people with an ab&s;o|lute &s;way, and the love of power &s;eems to have been the main &s;pring of all his actions. I am inclined to believe that his death will be attended with con&s;equences &s;omewhat
<PB N="202" REF="030668_0200_0FE85A126599F618">&s;imilar to tho&s;e which followed the death of Alexander the Great. His &s;piritual gene|rals will be putting in their pretentions, and &s;oon divide their ma&s;ter's conque&s;ts. His death happened at a time rather critical to the methodi&s;ts, as the <HI>Swedenborgians,</HI> or <HI>New Jeru&s;alemi&s;ts,</HI> are gaining ground very fa&s;t: Many of the methodi&s;ts, both preach|ers and hearers, are already gone over to their party, many more will now, undoubt|edly, follow; and the death of that great female champion of methodi&s;m, the Count|e&s;s of Huntingdon, which has &s;ince happen|ed, will in all probability occa&s;ion another con&s;iderable defection from <HI>that</HI> branch of methodi&s;ts, and an additional reinforcement to the Swedenborgians; a proof of the fond|ne&s;s of mankind for novelty, and the mar|vellous, even in religious matters.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH Mr. We&s;ley was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very great &s;hare both of natural and acquired abilities, yet I &s;uppo&s;e it &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to inform you, that this is by no means the ca&s;e with his preachers in general: for although there are among&s;t them &s;ome truly &s;en&s;ible, intelli|gent men, yet the major part are very igno|rant and extremely illiterate: many of the&s;e excellent &s;piritual guides cannot even read a chapter in the bible, though containing the deep my&s;teries which they have the ra&s;h|ne&s;s and pre&s;umption to pretend to explain. Many others cannot write their own names. But &s;o great is the ignorance of Mr. We&s;|ley's people in general, that they often ne|glect the more rational and &s;en&s;ible of their preachers, and are better plea&s;ed with &s;uch as are even de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e; re|ally
<PB N="204" REF="030668_0202_0FE85A1BC180EB10">believing that the incoherent non&s;en&s;e which they from time to time pour forth, is dictated by the holy &s;pirit; for which &s;ever|al rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>It is always ob&s;ervable, that the more ig|norant people are, the more confidence they po&s;&s;e&s;s. This con&s;idence or <HI>impudence,</HI> pa&s;&s;es with the vulgar, as a mark of their being in the right; and the more the igno|rance of the preachers is di&s;covered, the more are they brought down to their own &s;tandard. Again, the more ignorant preach|ers having very contracted ideas of real re|ligion and manly virtue, of cour&s;e &s;upply the want of it with a ridiculous fu&s;s about trifles, which pa&s;&s;es with the ignorant for a more &s;anctified deportment, and hence ari&s;es much of the mi&s;chief which has been &s;o ju&s;tly charged on the methodi&s;ts. For by making the path to heaven &s;o very narrow, and be&s;et with ten thou&s;and bugbears, many de&s;pairing to be ever able to walk in it, have thrown off all religion and morality, and &s;unk into the aby&s;s of vice and wickedne&s;s.

<P>This religious maniac &s;oon after preached very often in Smithfield and Moorfields; but he did not wholly depend on the opera|tions of the Holy Spirit, as at la&s;t he &s;eldom began to preach until he was nearly drunk, or filled with another kind of &s;pirit, and then he was "a very powerful preacher indeed!" But the good man happening &s;everal times to exert him&s;elf rather too much, had nearly tumbled headlong out of his portable pul|pit; the&s;e accidents the mob <HI>uncharitably</HI> a&s;cribed to the liquor that he had drank, and with mud, &s;tones, dead cats, &amp;c. drove him off every time he came, until at la&s;t our preacher took his leave of them with &s;aying "that he perceived it was in vain to at|tempt their conver&s;ion, as he &s;aw that God had given them over to the hardne&s;s of their hearts."</P>

However after all, "there is (po&s;&s;ibly) a plea&s;ure in being mad, which none but madmen know." The &s;ubject of methodi&s;m is &s;o fertile a one, that were I di&s;po&s;ed to enlarge thereon, my corre&s;pon|dence would be extended to a very con&s;ider|able length; but in&s;tead of pur&s;uing it, I think it better to apologize for having &s;o long digre&s;&s;ed from the main &s;ubject of my narrative.</P>
<P>But before I take my leave of the &s;ubject, I will in a few words inform you how the preachers were governed and &s;upported. Mr. We&s;ley every year ordered the major part of his travelling preachers in great Bri|tain and Ireland, which were upwards of two hundred in number, to meet together, one year at London, the next at Bri&s;tol, and the following at Manche&s;ter; this meeting he called a conference. At tho&s;e confer|ences, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the whole &s;ociety was tran&s;acted, new preachers admitted, and &s;ome turned off, or &s;ilenced; complaints heard, differences adju&s;ted, &amp;c. Mr. We&s;ley having divided great Britain into circuits, at tho&s;e conferences, he appointed the preachers to every circuit for the following year, and as he well knew the general want
<PB N="209" REF="030668_0207_0FE85A2C2EEE8AA8">of abilities among his preachers, he limited their time of preaching in one circuit to a year, and &s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure, made up the want of abilities by variety, mo&s;t of tho&s;e circuits had three or four preachers every year, and in many country places, they had but one &s;ermon a week from the travelling preachers, &s;o that each preacher preached about twelve &s;ermons in the year, (&s;ometimes it may be twenty) at each place. In every circuit one of the preachers was called the a&s;&s;i&s;tant: to him the various contributions were paid, and of him might be had any of Mr. We&s;ley's publications. He al&s;o ad|mitted new members, or turned out any who were judged unworthy of bearing the high appellation of a methodi&s;t.</P>
<P>Each itincrant preacher had a hor&s;e found him, which, with him&s;elf, is maintained by &s;ome brother or &s;i&s;ter wherever they go, as the preachers do not put up at any inn, and yet they have as regular &s;tages to call at as the coaches have, they having made converts at convenient di&s;tances in mo&s;t parts of Creat Britain and Ireland.</P>
<P>Each travelling preacher was then allow|ed twelve pounds a year, to find him&s;elf cloaths, pay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rnpikes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be&s;ides what they could get privately out of the old wo|men's
<PB N="210" REF="030668_0208_0FE85A3604480608">pockets. But be&s;ides tho&s;e circuit-preachers, there "are in the year 1790, in Europe and America, thirteen or fourteen hundred," of local holdersforth, who do not preach out of their own neighbourhood, and tho&s;e in general are the mo&s;t ignorant of all.</P>
<P>Many of the circuit-preachers only travel until they can marry a rich widow, or &s;ome ignorant young convert with money, which has often been the cau&s;e of great unhappi|ne&s;s, in many re&s;pectable families. The following poetical de&s;cription of the metho|di&s;t preachers, is &s;o much to my purpo&s;e, that I mu&s;t in&s;ert it:

<P>ALthough I was many years in connection with Mr. We&s;ley's people, it &s;eems, according to a pamphlet publi&s;hed a &s;ew months after the fir&s;t edi|tion of my memoirs, that I was but &s;uper&s;i|cially acquainted with Mr. We&s;ley and his preachers. The pamphlet is entitled, "A letter to the Rev. T. Coke, LL. D. and Mr. H. Moore." To which is added, "An Ap|peal and Remon&s;trance to the People called Methodi&s;ts, by an old member of the Soci|ety."
<PB N="213" REF="030668_0211_0FE85A403B206210">This old member informs us, that he has been acquainted with the methodi&s;ts twenty-eight years, and if their preachers are but half as bad as he has drawn them, they are a dete&s;table &s;et of &s;ly deceiving villains.

Mr. We&s;ley, offended by being thus ab|ruptly deprived of an opportunity of di&s;|playing his &s;uperior abilities, obeyed his ma&s;ter very reluctantly. When he had got into the parlour Mr. Tooke &s;aid to him: John, I wonder that you who are &s;o much above the lower forms &s;hould con&s;tantly a&s;|&s;ociate with them, for you &s;hould now con|&s;ider your&s;elf as a man, and affect the com|pany of the bigger boys, who are your

<P>"Mr. Tooke di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his pupil with this remarkable ob&s;ervation to an affi&s;tant ma&s;ter.&mdash;That boy though de&s;igned for the church will never get a living in it: for his ambitious &s;oul will never acknowledge a &s;uperior, or be confined to a pari&s;h.</P>

In his con&s;titution warm, and con&s;equently amorous; in his manner of living luxurious and &s;trictly epicurian and fond of di&s;hes highly reli&s;hed, and fond of drinking the riche&s;t wines, in which he indulged often, but never to exce&s;s. He was indebted more to his commanding, po|&s;itive, and authoritative manner, than to any intrin&s;ically &s;uperior abilities.</P>
<P>"Having thus given the outlines of his character, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that he ap|pears to have been more a philo&s;opher than a chri&s;tian: and &s;hall then proceed to &s;ome anecdotes and circum&s;tances which will cor|roborate my a&s;&s;ertions, and ju&s;tify my con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"As the <HI>work of God,</HI> as it is called, was the &s;phere of action in which he was more particularly and con&s;picuou&s;ly engaged, and as I have ventured to que&s;tion the &s;incerity
<PB N="221" REF="030668_0219_0FE85A63695329A0">of his profe&s;&s;ions, it is proper that I &s;hould &s;tate my rea&s;ons for &s;o doing. Fir&s;t then of conver&s;ion: in the <HI>methodi&s;tical</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word, for in the true &s;en&s;e, I apprehend to be neither more or le&s;s, than for&s;aking vice and practi&s;ing virtue; but however, the methodi&s;tical &s;en&s;e imports quite a dif|ferent thing, and it is in that &s;en&s;e we &s;hall view it. I have made it an invariable ob|&s;ervation, that Mr. We&s;ley, although he was often in the company of &s;en&s;ible men, who were capable of forming an opinion, and pre|&s;uming to judge for them&s;elves by the light of nature, the evidence of the &s;en&s;es, and the aid of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy; but of &s;uch, he never attempted the conver&s;ion. In his own family and among&s;t his relations, he never attempted, or if he did attempt he ne|ver &s;ucceeded: except now and then with a &s;emale, in whom he found a heart &s;u&s;cept|ible of any impre&s;&s;ion he plea&s;ed to give. It is remarkable, that even the children of Mr. C. W. were never converted&mdash;becau&s;e they, and mo&s;t of his relations, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;en&s;e enough to di&s;cover hypocri&s;y, and hone&s;ty enough to reject the advantage they might have derived from a&s;&s;uming it. But what is &s;till more e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">truordinary, is, that out of &s;o many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, who have been edu|cated
<PB N="222" REF="030668_0220_0FE85A6AE77A75E8">at <HI>King&s;weed,</HI> in the mo&s;t rigid di&s;ci|pline of methodi&s;in, hardly any have em|braced their tenets, or become members of the &s;ociety. The rea&s;on is pretty obvious, they were taught too much to imbibe the ridiculous prejudices the founder wi&s;hed to be in&s;tilled into their minds: philo&s;ophy and methodi&s;m, are utterly incompatible.

<P>"It is true indeed, the <HI>work</HI> was &s;ome|times attended with power among the chil|dren at <HI>King&s;wood. Conver&s;ions</HI> were fre|quent; but never durable.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR your obliging letter which I re|ceived this morning, I return you thanks.</P>
<P>Our opinions for the mo&s;t part perfect|ly coincide re&s;pecting the &s;tability of the connection, after my head is laid in the du&s;t. This, however, is a &s;ubject, about which I am not &s;o anxious as you &s;eem to imagine; on the contrary, it is a matter of the utmo&s;t indifference to me; as I have long fore&s;een that a divi&s;ion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue, from cau&s;es &s;o various, unavoidable and certain, that I have long &s;ince given overall thoughts and hopes of &s;ettling it on a permanent foundation. You do not &s;eem to be aware of the mo&s;t effective cau&s;e that will bring about a divi&s;ion. You apprehend the mo&s;t &s;eri|ous con&s;equences from a &s;truggle between the preachers for power and pre-eminence, and there being none among them of &s;uffi|cient authority or abi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ities to &s;upport the dignity, or command the re&s;pect and exact the implicit obedience which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to uphold our con&s;titution on its pre&s;ent principles. This is one thing that will oper|ate very powerfully again&s;t unity in the con|nection, and is, perhaps, what I might po&s;&s;i|bly have prevented, had not a &s;till greater difficulty ari&s;en in my mind: I have often wi&s;hed for &s;ome per&s;on of abilities to &s;ucceed
<PB N="228" REF="030668_0226_0FE85A860BBF08C8">me as the head of the church I have with &s;uch indefatigable pains, and a&s;toni&s;hing &s;uc|ce&s;s e&s;tabli&s;hed; but convinced that none but very &s;uperior abilities would be equal to the undertaking, was I to adopt a &s;ucce&s;|&s;or of this de&s;cription, I &s;ear he might gain &s;o much influence among the people, as to u&s;urp a &s;hare, if not the whole of that ab&s;o|lute and uncontroulable power, which I have hitherto, and am determined I will maintain &s;o long as I live: never will I bear a rival near my throne.&mdash;You no doubt &s;ee the policy of continually changing the preachers from one circuit to another at &s;hort periods: for &s;hould any of them be|come popular with their different congrega|tions, and in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the fa|vour of their hearers, they might po&s;&s;ibly obtain &s;uch influence, as to e&s;tabli&s;h them|&s;elves independently of me, and the general connection. Be&s;ides the novelty of the continual change, excites curio&s;ity, and is the more nece&s;&s;ary, as few of our preachers have abilities to render them&s;elves in any degree tolerable, any longer than they are new.</P>
<P>The principal cau&s;e which will inevitably effect a diminution and divi&s;ion in the con|nexion after my death, will he the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of &s;ub&s;criptions and contributions towards

If it is with the greate&s;t difficulty that even I can keep them together, for want of this very nece&s;&s;ary article, I think no one el&s;e can. Another cau&s;e, which with others will effect the divi&s;ion, is the di&s;putes and contentions that will ari&s;e between the preachers and the parties that will e&s;pou&s;e their &s;everal cau&s;es, by which means much truth will be brought to light, which will re|flect &s;o much to their di&s;advantage, that the eyes of the people will be opened to &s;ee their motives and principles, nor will they any longer contribute to their &s;upport, when they &s;ind all their pretentions to &s;anc|tity and love are founded on motives of in|tere&s;t and ambition. The con&s;equence of which will be, a &s;ew of the mo&s;t popular will e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in the re&s;pective places where they have gained &s;ufficient in|fluence over the minds of the people; the re&s;t mu&s;t revert to their original humble callings. But this no way concerns me: I have attained the object of my views, by e&s;|tabli&s;hing a name that will not &s;oon peri&s;h from the face of the earth; I have founded a &s;ect that will boa&s;t my name, long after my di&s;cipline and doctrines are forgotten.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="030668_0228_0FE85A8C3440ADB0">
My character and reputation for &s;anc|tity is now beyond the reach of calumny; nor will any thing that may herea&s;ter come to light, or be &s;aid concerning me, to my prejudice, however true, gain credit.</P>

<P>My new wi&s;e's at|tachment to books was a very &s;ortunate cir|cum&s;tance for us both, not only as it was a perpetual &s;ource of rational amu&s;ement, but al&s;o as it tended to promote my trade: her extreme love for books made her delight to be in the &s;hop, &s;o that &s;he &s;oon became per|&s;ectly acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inted with every part of it and (as my &s;tock increa&s;ed) with other rooms where I kept books, and could readily get any article that was a&s;ked for. Accordingly, when I was out on bu&s;ine&s;s, my &s;hop was well attended. This con&s;tant attention and good u&s;uage, procured me many cu&s;tomers; and I &s;oon perceived that I could &s;eil dou|ble and treble the quantity of books if I
<PB N="235" REF="030668_0233_0FE85AA1F8B8F730">had a larger &s;tock. But how to enlarge it, I knew not, except by &s;low degrees, as my profits &s;hould enable me; for as I was al|mo&s;t a &s;tranger in London, I had but few acquaintances, and the&s;e few were not of the opulent &s;ort. I al&s;o &s;aw that the town a|bounded with cheats, &s;windlers, &amp;c. who obtained money and other property, under fal&s;e pretences, of which the credulous were defrauded, which often prevented me from endeavouring to borrow, le&s;t I &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of having the &s;ame bad de&s;igns.</P>
<P>I was &s;everal times &s;o hard put to it, for ca&s;h to purcha&s;e parcels of books which were offered to me, that I more than once pawned my watch, and a &s;uit of cloaths, and twice I pawned &s;ome books for money to purcha&s;e others; but I &s;oon was tired of pawnbrokers, and at that time they were not &s;o re&s;tricted, as now, in re&s;pect to intere&s;t, and thinking my&s;elf impo&s;ed on, by being charged more than was rea&s;onable, I never redeemed the la&s;t parcel at all; for, indeed, they were books that I had bought extreme|ly cheap, &s;o that I borrowed more money on t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em than they co&s;t me, and in &s;o doing rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d my&s;elf what I had been overcharged.

Soon after I commenced book&s;eller, I became acquianted with what Pope calls "the noble&s;t work of God," an HONEST man. This was Mr JOHN DENIS, an oil|man in Cannon-&s;treet (father of the pre&s;ent Mr. John Denis, book&s;eller.) This gen|tleman had often vi&s;ited me during my long illne&s;s, and having &s;een me tranquil and &s;e|rene when on the very point of death, he formed a favourable conclu&s;ion that I too mu&s;t be an hone&s;t man, as I had &s;o quiet a con&s;cience at &s;uch an awful period. Having retained the&s;e ideas of me after my recovery, and being perfectly well acquainted with my circum&s;tances, he one day offered to be|come a partner in my bu&s;ine&s;s, and to ad|vance money in proportion to my &s;tock. This confidential ofter I &s;oon accepted; early in 1778 he became partner; and we very &s;oon laid out his money in &s;econd-hand books, which increa&s;ed the &s;tock at once to double.</P>
<P>I &s;oon after this propo&s;ed printing a &s;ale catalogue, to which, after making a few ob|jections, Mr. Denis con&s;ented. This cata|logue of twelve thou&s;and volumes (&s;uch as they were) was publi&s;hed in 1779. My partner's name was not in the title page, the addre&s;s was only "J. LACKINGTON and Co. No. 46, Chi&s;well-&s;treet." This our fir&s;t
<PB N="237" REF="030668_0235_0FE85AAABADF74F8">publication produced very oppo&s;ite effects on tho&s;e who peru&s;ed it; in &s;ome it excited much mirth, in others an equal proportion of anger. The major part of it was written by me, but Mr. Denis wrote many pages of it; and as his own private library con&s;i&s;ted of &s;carce old my&s;tical and alchymical books, printed above a century ago, many of them were in bad condition; this led him to in|&s;ert <HI>neat</HI> in the catalogue to many articles, which were only neat when compared with &s;uch as were in very bad condition; &s;o that when we produced &s;uch books as were cal|led <HI>neat</HI> in our catalogue, we often got our|&s;elves laughed at, and &s;ometimes our <HI>neat</HI> articles were heartily <HI>damned.</HI> We had al&s;o a deal of trouble on another &s;core; Mr. Denis in&s;erted a number of articles without the authors' names, and a&s;&s;ured me that the books were well known, and to mention the authors was often u&s;ele&s;s. The fact was, Mr. Denis knew who wrote tho&s;e articles; but was &s;oon convinced that many others did not, as we were often obliged to produce them merely to let our cu&s;tomers &s;ee who were the authors: we however took twenty pounds the fir&s;t week the books were on &s;ale, which we thought a large &s;um. The increa&s;e of our &s;tock augmented our cu&s;|tomers in proportion; &s;o that Mr. Denis,
<PB N="238" REF="030668_0236_0FE85AB213996520">finding that his money turned to a better ac|count in book&s;elling than in the funds, very &s;oon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent the &s;tock near two hundred pounds which I &s;till turned to a good account. We went on very friendly and pro&s;perou&s;ly for a little more than two years; when one night Mr. Denis hinted that he thought I was making purcha&s;es too fa&s;t, on which I grew warm, and reminded him of an article in our partner&s;hip agreement by which I was to be &s;ole purcha&s;er, and was at liberty to make what purcha&s;es I &s;hould judge pro|per. I al&s;o reminded him of the pro&s;its which my purcha&s;es produced, and he re|minded me of his having more money in the trade than I had. We were inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d both very warm; and on my &s;ying, that if he was di&s;plea&s;ed with any part of my conduct, he was at liberty to quit the partner&s;hip, he in great warmth replied that he would. The above pa&s;&s;ed at Mr. Denis's hou&s;e in Hoxton-&s;quare, I then bade him good night. When Mr. Denis called at the &s;hop the next day, he a&s;ked me if I continued in the &s;ame mind I was in the preceding night? I a&s;&s;ured him that I did. He then demanded of me whether I in&s;i&s;ted on his keeping his word to quit the partner&s;hip? I replied, I did not <HI>in&s;i&s;t</HI> on it, as I had taken him a partner for three years, nearly one third part
<PB N="239" REF="030668_0237_0FE85AB39F1C5330">of which time was unexpired; but, I added, that, as I had always found him &s;trictly a man of his word, I &s;uppo&s;ed he would prove him&s;elf &s;o in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance and not a&s;&s;ert one thing at night and another in the morning. On which he ob&s;erved, that as he was not provided with a &s;hop, he mu&s;t take &s;ome time to look for one. I told him he might take as long a time as he thought nece&s;&s;ary. This was in March 1780. He appointed the twentieth of May, following. On that day we accordingly di&s;&s;olved the partner&s;hip; and, as he had more money in the trade than my&s;elf, he took my notes for what I was deficient. We parted in great friend&s;hip, which continued to the day of his death; he generally called every morn|ing to &s;ee us, and learn our concerns, and we con&s;tantly informed him of all that had pa&s;&s;ed the preceding day; as how much ca&s;h we had taken, what were the profits, what purcha&s;es we had made, what bills we had to pay, &amp;c. and he &s;ometimes lent me money to help to pay them.</P>
<P>At his death he left behind him in his private library the be&s;t collection of &s;carce, valuable, my&s;tical, and alchymical books, that ever was collected by one per&s;on. In his lifetime he prized the&s;e kinds of books above every thing; in collecting them he
<PB N="240" REF="030668_0238_0FE85ABAA26C60C0">never cared what price he paid for them. This led him to think, after he became a book&s;eller, that other book-collectors &s;hould pay their money as freely as he had done his, which was often a &s;ubject of debate be|tween him and me, as I was for &s;elling eve|ry thing cheap, in order to &s;ecure tho&s;e cu&s;|tomers already obtained, as well as increa&s;e their numbers.</P>
<P>Mr. Denis was, at the time of his death, about fifty years of age. He informed me that in his childhood and youth he was weakly to an extreme, &s;o that no one who knew him ever thought he could live to be twenty years of age; however he enjoyed an uninterrupted &s;tate of health for nearly the la&s;t thirty years of his life; this he a&s;|cribed to his &s;trictly adhering to the rules laid down by <HI>Cornaro</HI> and <HI>Tryon</HI> in their books on Health, Long Life and Happine&s;s. His unexpected death was in con&s;equence of a fever caught by &s;itting in a cold damp room.</P>

<P>IT was &s;ome time in the year &s;eventeen hundred and eighty, when I re&s;olved from that period to give no per&s;on whatever any credit. I was induced to make this re&s;olution from various mo|tives: I had ob&s;erved, that where credit was given, mo&s;t bills were not paid within &s;ix months, many not within a twelvemonth, and &s;ome not within two years. Indeed, many trade&s;men have accounts of &s;even years &s;tanding; and &s;ome bills are never paid. The lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the intere&s;t of money in long credits, and by tho&s;e bills that were not paid at all; the inconvenien|ces attending not having the ready-money to lay out in trade to the be&s;t advantage, together with the great lo&s;s of time in keep|ing accounts, and collecting debts, convin|ced me, that if I could but e&s;tabli&s;h a rea|dy-money bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>without any exceptions,</HI> I &s;hould be enabled to &s;ell every article
<PB N="242" REF="030668_0240_0FE85AC371FBC2D8">very cheap. When I communicated my ideas on this &s;ubject to &s;ome of my acquain|tances, I was much laughed at and ridicul|ed; and it was thought, that I might as well attempt to rebuild the tower of Babel, as to e&s;tabli&s;h a large bu&s;ine&s;s without giving cre|dit. But notwith&s;tanding this di&s;courage|ment, and even <HI>You,</HI> my dear friend, ex|pre&s;&s;ing your doubts of the practicability of my &s;cheme, I determined to make the expe|riment; and began by marking in every book the lowe&s;t price that I would take for it; which being much lower than the com|mon market prices, I not only retained my former cu&s;tomers, but &s;oon increa&s;ed their numbers. But, my dear &s;ir, you can &s;carce imagine what difficulties I encountered for &s;everal years together. I even &s;ometimes thought of relinqui&s;hing this my favourite &s;cheme altogether, as by it I was obliged to deny credit to my very acquaintance; I was al&s;o under a nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;u&s;ing it to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters, as <HI>no excep|tion</HI> was, or now is made, not even in fa|vour of nobility; my porters being &s;trictly enjoined, by one general order, to bring back all books not previou&s;ly paid for, ex|cept they receive the amount on del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ery. Again, many in the country found it diffi|cult to remit &s;mall &s;ums that are below ban|kers
<PB N="243" REF="030668_0241_0FE85AC501833118">notes, and others to whom I was a &s;tranger, did not like to &s;end the money fir&s;t, as not knowing how I &s;hould treat them, and &s;u&s;pecting by the price of the articles, there mu&s;t certainly be &s;ome deception. Many unacquainted with my plan of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, were much offended, until the advan|tages accruing to them from it were duly explained, when they very readily acceded to it. As to the anger of &s;uch, who though they were acquainted with it, were &s;till de|termined to deal on credit only, I con&s;ider|ed that as of little con&s;equence, from an opinion that &s;ome of them would have been as much enraged when their bills were &s;ent in, had credit been given them.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t three years after I refu&s;ed to give credit to any per&s;on, my bu&s;ine&s;s en|crea&s;ed much, and as the whole of my pro|fits (after paying all expences) was laid out in books, my &s;tock was continually enlarged &s;o that my catalogues in the year &s;eventeen hundred and eighty-four, were very much augmented in &s;ize. The fir&s;t contained twelve thou&s;and, and the &s;econd thirty thou|&s;and volumes: this increa&s;e was not merely in numbers, but al&s;o in value, as a very great part of the&s;e volumes were <HI>better,</HI> that is, books of an higher price.</P>

<P>I Promi&s;ed to give you a few remarks on purcha&s;ing manu|&s;cripts; and as I &s;eldom make &s;uch purcha|&s;es, and but rarely publi&s;h any new books, I think you may fairly credit me for impar|tiality. Nothing is more common than to hear authors complaining again&s;t publi&s;hers, for want of liberality in purcha&s;ing their manu&s;cripts. But I cannot help thinking that mo&s;t of the&s;e complaints are groundle&s;s: and that were all things con&s;idered, publi&s;h|ers (at lea&s;t many of them) would be allow|ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s more liberality than any other &s;et of trade&s;men, I mean &s;o far as relates to the purcha&s;ing manu&s;cripts and copy-right.</P>
<P>Not to trouble you with a long enumera|tion of in&s;tances in confirmation of this a&s;&s;ertion, I &s;hall barely mention the follow|ing:</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="030668_0243_0FE85ACD922A73A0">
It is owing to the encouragement of book&s;ellers that the public is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that valuable work John&s;on's Dictionary; and the &s;ame liberality to the doctor in re&s;|pect to that publication, his edition of Shake|&s;peare, and the Engli&s;h Poets will always re&s;lect honour on the parties. So &s;en&s;ible was the doctor of this, that he a&s;&s;erted book|&s;ellers were the be&s;t Mecaenas's.</P>
<P>The late &s;ir John Hawkins, Dr. Cullen, the pre&s;ent Dr. Robert&s;on, Mr. Gibbon, Dr. Knox, &amp;c. &amp;c. arc all &s;triking in&s;tances of the truth of my ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>As I feel a plea&s;ure in mentioning acts of liberality wherever they occur, &s;uffer me to quote the following pa&s;&s;age from &s;ir John Hawkins's Life of Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P>"The book&s;ellers with whom Mr. Cham|bers had contracted for his dictionary, find|ing that the work &s;ucceeded beyond their expectations, made him a voluntary pre&s;ent of, I think, 500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> Other in&s;tances of the like genero&s;ity have been known of a pro|fe&s;&s;ion of men, who, in the debates on the que&s;tion of literary property, have been de&s;|cribed as &s;candalous monopo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, fatten|ing at the expence of o her m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s ingenuity, and growing opulent by oppre&s;&s;ion."</P>

<PB N="246" REF="030668_0244_0FE85AD47784E7E8">Hawke&s;worth received &s;ix thou&s;and pounds for his compilation of voyages, if &s;o (and I have never heard it contradicted) I leave it to any con&s;iderate per&s;on to judge, whe|ther in paying &s;o enormous a price, the pub|li&s;hers did not run a great ri&s;k, when it is con&s;idered how great the expences of bring|ing forward &s;uch a work, mu&s;t have been. I have al&s;o been informed that David Mal|let, F&s;q. was o&s;&s;ered two thou&s;and pounds for Lord Bolingbroke's Philo&s;ophical Works, which he re&s;u&s;ed.</P>
<P>It ought al&s;o to be con&s;idered, that fre|quently the money which is paid for the copy, is but tri&s;ling, compared with the ex|pence of printing, paper, adverti&s;ing, &amp;c. and hundreds of in&s;tances may be adduced of publi&s;hers having &s;u&s;tained very great lo&s;&s;es, and many have been made bankrupts, through their liberality in purcha&s;ing manu|&s;cripts and publi&s;hing them; and on the other hand, it mu&s;t be acknowledged that &s;ome publi&s;hers have made great fortunes by their copy rights, but their number is comparitively &s;mall.</P>
<P>It &s;hould al&s;o be remarked that authors in general, are apt to form too great expec|tations from their productions, many in&s;tan|ces of which I could give you, but I will only produce one.</P>

<P>IT has been a&s;ked, times innumerable, how I acquired any to|lerable degree of knowledge, &s;o as to enable me to form any ideas of the merits or deme|rits of books; or how I became &s;ufficiently acquainted with the prices that books were commonly &s;old for, &s;o as to be able to buy and &s;ell; particularly books in the learned and foreign languages.</P>
<P>As to the little knowledge of literature I po&s;&s;e&s;s, it was acquired by dint of applica|tion. In the beginning I attached my&s;elf very clo&s;ely to the &s;tudy of divinity and
<PB N="250" REF="030668_0248_0FE85AE5D8278860">moral philo&s;ophy, &s;o that I became tolerably acquainted with all the points controverted between the divines; after having read the great champions for chri&s;tianity, I next read the works of Toulmin, Lord Herbert, Tin|dal, Chubb, Morgan, Collins, Hammond, Wool&s;ton, Annet, Mandeville, Shafte&s;bury, D'Argens, Bolingbroke, Williams, Helve|tius, Voltaire, and many other free-thinkers. I have al&s;o read mo&s;t of our Engli&s;h poets, and the be&s;t tran&s;lations of the Greek, Latin, Italian and French poets; nor did I omit to read Hi&s;tory, Voyages, Travels, Natural Hi&s;tory, Biography, &amp;c. At one time I had a &s;trong inclination to learn French, but as &s;oon as I was enabled to make out and abridge title pages, &s;o as to in&s;ert them right in my catalogues, I left off for what appeared to me more plea&s;ing as well as more nece&s;&s;ary pur&s;uits; reflecting that as I began &s;o late in life, and had probably but a very &s;hort period to live (and I paid &s;ome regard to what Helvetius has a&s;&s;erted, viz. that "No man acquires any new ideas after he is forty-five years of age.") I had no time to be&s;tow on the attainment of languages. I therefore contented my&s;elf with reading all the tran&s;lations of the cla&s;&s;ics, and in&s;erting the originals in my catalogues as well as I could; and when &s;ometimes I
<PB N="251" REF="030668_0249_0FE85AE76593DB98">happened to put the <HI>Genitive</HI> or <HI>Dative</HI> ca&s;e in&s;tead of the <HI>Neminative</HI> or <HI>Accu&s;ative,</HI> my cu&s;tomers kindly con&s;idered this as a venial fault, which they readily pardoned, and bought the books notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>As I have indefatigably u&s;ed my be&s;t en|deavours to acquire knowledge, I never thought I had the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed on account of my deficiency, e&s;pe|cially as I never made pretentions to erudi|tion, or affected to po&s;&s;e&s;s what I knew I was deficient in.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thas been long &s;ince remarked, that a per&s;on may be well ac|quainted with books, or in other words, may be a very learned man, and yet remain almo&s;t totally ignorant of men and manners, as Mallet remarks of a famous divine:
<Q><L>"While Bentley, long to wrangling &s;chools con|fin'd,</L>

<L>"Dares, in the fulne&s;s of the pedant's pride,</L>

<BIBL>Verbal Critici&s;m.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The reading and &s;tudying of Hi&s;tory, Voyages, Travels, &amp;c. will no doubt con|tribute much to that kind of knowledge, but will not alone be &s;ufficient. In order to become a proficient in that u&s;eful branch of knowledge, "MAN KNOW THYSELF!"
<PB N="254" REF="030668_0252_0FE85AF6B5269140">was a precept of the ancient philo&s;ophers. But I can &s;carce think it po&s;&s;ible for any man to be well acquainted with him&s;elf, without his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a tolerable degree of knowledge of the re&s;t of mankind. In the former part of my life I &s;aw a deal of what is called <HI>low life,</HI> and became acquainted with the cu&s;toms, manners, di&s;po&s;itions, pre|judices, &amp;c. of the labouring part of the community, in various cities, towns and vil|lages; for years pa&s;t, I have &s;pent &s;ome of my lei&s;ure hours among that cla&s;s of people who are called opulent or genteel trade&s;|men; nor have I been totally excluded from higher circles; but among all the &s;chools where the knowledge of mankind is to be acquired, I know of none equal to that of a <HI>book&s;eller's &s;hop,</HI> e&s;pecially if the ma&s;ter is of an inqui&s;itive and communica|tive turn, and is in a con&s;iderable line of bu&s;ine&s;s; His &s;hop will then be a place of re&s;ort for men, women, and children, of va|rious nations, and more of various capaci|tics, di&s;po&s;itions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Would my health permit my con&s;tant at|tendance, I &s;hould prefer it, to every thing in life (reading excepted) and you may re|collect that for &s;ome years I &s;ought no other amu&s;ement whatever.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I cannot help ob&s;erv|ing,
<PB N="255" REF="030668_0253_0FE85AF8467C1860">that the &s;ale of books in general has increa&s;ed prodigiou&s;ly within the la&s;t twen|ty years. According to the be&s;t e&s;timation I have been able to make, I &s;uppo&s;e that more than four times the number of books are &s;old now than were &s;old twenty years &s;ince. The poorer &s;ort of farmers, and even the poor country people in general, who before that period &s;pent their winter evenings in relating &s;tories of witches, gho&s;ts, hobgoblins, &amp;c. now &s;horten the winter nights by hearing their &s;ons and daughters read tales, romances &amp;c. In &s;hort all ranks and degrees now READ. But the mo&s;t ra|pid increa&s;e of the &s;ale of books has been &s;ince the termination of the late war.</P>
<P>A number of book-clubs are al&s;o formed in every part of England, where each mem|ber &s;ub&s;cribes a certain &s;um quarterly to purcha&s;e books; in &s;ome of the&s;e clubs the books after they have been read by all the &s;ub&s;cribers, are &s;old among them to the highe&s;t bidders, and the money produced by &s;uch &s;ale, is expended in fre&s;h purcha&s;es, by which prudent and judicious mode, each member has it in his power to become po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the work of any particular author he may judge de&s;erving a &s;uperior degree of attention; and the members at large en|joy the advantage of a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="256" REF="030668_0254_0FE85AFF51A53E10">of different publications, in&s;tead of being re&s;tricted to a repeated peru&s;al of the &s;ame authors; which mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e with many if &s;o rational a plan had not been adopted.</P>
<P>I am informed that when circulating li|braries were fir&s;t opened, the book&s;ellers were much alarmed, and their rapid increa&s;e added to their fears, and led them to think that the &s;ale of books would be much dimi|ni&s;hed by &s;uch libraries. But experience has proved that the &s;ale of books, &s;o far from being dimini&s;hed by them, has been greatly promoted, as from tho&s;e repo&s;itories, many thou&s;and families have been cheaply &s;upplied with books, by which the ta&s;te for reading has become much more general, and thou&s;ands of books are purcha&s;ed eve|ry year, by &s;uch as have fir&s;t borrowed them at tho&s;e libraries, and after reading, approving of them, become purcha&s;ers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sunday-Schools</HI> are &s;preading-very fa&s;t in mo&s;t parts of England, which will accelerate the di&s;&s;u&s;ion of knowledge among the lower cla&s;&s;es of the community, and in a very few years exceedingly increa&s;e the &s;ale of books.&mdash;Here permit me earne&s;tly to call on every hone&s;t book&s;eller (I tru&s;t my call will not be in vain) as well as on every friend to the extention of knowledge,
<PB N="257" REF="030668_0255_0FE85B00DCA0A4D0">to unite (as <HI>you</HI> I am confident will) in a hearty AMEN.</P>
<P>Let &s;uch as doubt whether the enlighten|ing of the under&s;tandings of the lower orders of &s;ociety, makes them happier, or be of any utility to a &s;tate, read the following lines (particularly the la&s;t twelve) by Dr. Gold&s;mith, taken from his Traveller.</P>

<P>It is worth remarking that the introdu|cing hi&s;tories, romances, &s;tories, poems, &amp;c. into &s;chools, has been a very great means of diffu&s;ing a general ta&s;te for reading among all ranks of people, while in &s;chools, the children only read the Bible (which was the ca&s;e in many &s;chools a few years ago) chil|dren then did not make &s;o early a progre&s;s in reading as they have &s;ince, they have been plea&s;ed and entertained as well as in|&s;tructed; and this reli&s;h for books, in many will la&s;t as long as life.</P>
<P>I pity from my &s;oul many poor wretches which I ob&s;erve bartering away their con&s;ti|tutions, and what few liberal &s;entiments they may po&s;&s;e&s;s; ri&s;ing early and &s;itting up late, exerting all the powers of body and mind, to get what they call a competency, no matter by what means this is effected; thou|&s;ands actually de&s;troy them&s;elves in accom|pli&s;hing their grand de&s;ign: others, live to

But, alas, the promi&s;ed happine&s;s is as far from them as ever, often farther. The bu&s;y bu&s;tling &s;cene of bu&s;ine&s;s being over, a vacuity in the mind takes place, &s;pleen and vapors &s;ucceed, which increa&s;e bodily in|firmities, death &s;tares them in the face.

Gardens and plea&s;ure grounds be|come dreary de&s;erts; the mi&s;erable po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors linger out a wretched exi&s;tence, or put a period to it with a halter or pi&s;tol.</P>
<Q><L>"Were this not common would it not be &s;trange?</L>
<L>"That 'tis &s;o common, this is &s;tranger &s;till."</L></Q>
<P>I now &s;ell more than one hundred thou&s;and volumes annually. The profits of my bu&s;i|ne&s;s the pre&s;ent year 1791 (as near as can be computed before the expiration of it) will amount to FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS.

<P>It is now above five years &s;ince I began to
<PB N="260" REF="030668_0258_0FE85B10A40782C0">entertain &s;erious thoughts of going out of bu&s;ine&s;s on account of the bad &s;tate of health which both Mrs. LACKINGTON and my&s;elf have laboured under: but it was then &s;ug|ge&s;ted by &s;everal of my friends, that as I had about fifty poor relations, a great number of whom are children, others are old and nearly helple&s;s, and that all had ju&s;tly formed &s;ome expectations from me; therefore to give up &s;uch a trade as I was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, before I was ab&s;olutely obliged to do it, would be a kind of <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> to tho&s;e whom by the ties of blood I was in &s;ome mea&s;ure bound to re|lieve and protect. The&s;e and other con&s;i|derations induced me to wave the thoughts of precipitating my&s;elf out of &s;o exten&s;ive and lucrative a bu&s;ine&s;s; and in the mean time I apply a part of the profits of it to maintain my good old mother, who is alive at Wellington in Somer&s;et&s;hire, her native place.

Accordingly in July la&s;t, 1791, we &s;et out from Merton, which I now make my chief re&s;idence, taking Bath, Bri&s;tol, &amp;c. in our way to my native place Wellington.</P>
<P>In Bri&s;tol, Exbridge, Bridgewater, Taun|ton, Wellington, and other places, I amu&s;ed my&s;elf in calling on &s;ome of my ma&s;ters, with whom I had about twenty years before worked as a journeyman &s;hoemaker.

At Taunton and Wellington it &s;eemed to be the unanimous determination of all the poorer &s;ort, that I &s;hould by no means be deficient in <HI>old acquaintance.</HI> Some poor &s;ouls declared that they had known me for <HI>fifty</HI> years (that is, years before I was born) others had danced me in their arms a thou|&s;and times; nay, better &s;till, &s;ome knew my grandmother; but, be&s;t of all, one old man claimed acquaintance with me, for having &s;een me many times on the top of a &s;ix-and-twenty round ladder, balanced on the chin of a merry Andrew! The old man was how|ever egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken, as I never was &s;o precariou&s;ly exalted.

This I ob&s;erved, that none of them were common beggars, but poor u&s;eful labouring people. Giving to common &s;trollers is but encou|raging idlene&s;s and every other vice. <HI>And as &s;mall matters made many happy,</HI> I was &s;u|premely &s;o, to be the means of contribut|ing to their comfort.

But to proceed with my journey.

<P>During our continuance at Wellington, I one morning rode over to Black Down, on purpo&s;e to in&s;pect an immen&s;e heap of &s;tones on the top of the hill, &s;trait before the town, which I remembered to have &s;een when a boy. The di&s;tance from Welling|ton is about two miles. Tho&s;e &s;tones cover about an acre of ground, and ri&s;e to a great height. The country people informed me with great gravity, that "the Devil brought them therein one night in his <HI>leathern apron.</HI>" But the name of it, as well as the form, prove what it was. It is called Symmon's <HI>Borough</HI> or <HI>Barrow;</HI> which, you know, &s;ignifies a burial-place. I &s;hould not have taken any notice of it here, had I ever &s;een any Barrow of <HI>&s;tones</HI> be&s;ides this, and five other finaller Barrows, about half a mile from the large one. The country people informed me that the <HI>devil</HI> brought the five heaps in his
<PB N="268" REF="030668_0266_0FE85B3042122AA8" MS="y"><HI>glove.</HI> I al&s;o ob&s;erved the remains of a large camp near the &s;pot. Camden has ta|ken notice of a large camp at Roach Ca&s;tle, three or four miles from hence; It is &s;trange that neither he nor Gough &s;hould take any notice of &s;o &s;ingular a Barrow as this cer|tainly is.</P>
<P>I have now, &s;ir, given you the mo&s;t ma|terial circum&s;tances of my life. And &s;hould the fine air of Merton pre&s;erve my &s;tock of health and &s;pirits which I have acquired in this la&s;t excur&s;ion, I intend during the &s;um|mer to &s;pend a few hours in the middle of three or four days in every week in Chi&s;well|&s;treet, devoting the mornings and evenings to my rural retreat,
<Q><L>"Where cheerfulne&s;s triumphant fair,</L>
<L>"Di&s;pels the painful cloud of care,</L>
<L>"O, &s;weet of language, mild of mein,</L>
<L>"O, virtue's friend, and plea&s;ure's queen!</L>
<L>"By thee our board with flow'rs is crown'd,</L>
<L>"By thee with &s;ongs our walks re&s;ound;</L>
<L>"By thee the &s;prightly mornings &s;hine,</L>
<L>"And ev'ning hours in peace decline."</L></Q></P>
<P>During the winter I purpo&s;e &s;pending mo&s;t of my time in town; where I hope again to enjoy the company of you, &s;ir, and &s;ome others of our old philo&s;ophical friends.</P>
