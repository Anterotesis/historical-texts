<HEAD>THE AMERICAN CRISIS, NUMBER V.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>TO GENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO argue with a man who has renounced the u&s;e and authority of rea&s;on, and who&s;e phi|lo&s;ophy con&s;i&s;ts in holding humanity in con|tempt, is like admini&s;tring medicine to the dead, or endeavouring to convert an Athei&s;t by &s;cripture. En|joy, Sir, your in&s;en&s;ibility of feeling and reflecting. It is the prerogative of animals. And no man will envy you tho&s;e honours, in which a &s;avage only can be your rival and a bear your ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>As the genero&s;ity of this country rewarded your brother's &s;ervices la&s;t war with an elegant monument in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, it is con&s;i&s;tent that &s;he &s;hould be|&s;tow &s;ome mark of di&s;tinction upon you. You certain|ly de&s;erve her notice, and a con&s;picuous place in the catalogue of extraordinary per&s;ons. Yet it would be pity to pa&s;s you from the world in &s;tate, and con&s;ign you to magnificent oblivion among the tombs, with|out telling the future beholder why. Judas is as much known as John, yet hi&s;tory a&s;cribes their fame to very different actions.</P>
<P>Sir William hath undoubtedly merited a monument: But of what kind, or with what in&s;cription, where placed or how embelli&s;hed, is a que&s;tion that would puzzle all the Heralds of St James's in the profounde&s;t mood of hi&s;torical deliberation. We are at no lo&s;s, Sir, to a&s;certain your real character, but &s;omewhat perplex|ed how to perpetuate it's identity, and pre&s;erve it
<PB N="64" REF="015951_0003_0F9B236F79003D48">
uninjured from the transformations of time or mi&s;take. A &s;tatuary may give a fal&s;e expre&s;&s;ion to your bu&s;t, or decorate it with &s;ome equivocal emblems, by which you may happen to &s;teal into reputation and impo&s;e upon the hereafter traditionary world. Ill nature or ridicule may con&s;pire, or a variety of accidents com|bine, to le&s;&s;en, enlarge, or change Sir William's fame; and no doubt but he who has taken &s;o much pains to be &s;ingular in his conduct, would choo&s;e to be ju&s;t as &s;ingular in his exit, his monument and his epitaph.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual honours of the dead, to be &s;ure, are not &s;ufficiently &s;ublime to e&s;cort a character like you to the republic of du&s;t and a&s;hes; for however men may differ in their ideas of grandeur or government here, the grave is neverthele&s;s a perfect republic. Death is not the monarch of the dead, but of the dying. The moment he obtains a conque&s;t he lo&s;es a &s;ubject, and, like the fooli&s;h King you &s;erve, will, in the end, war him&s;elf out of all dominion.</P>
<P>As a proper preliminary towards the arrangement of your funeral honors, we readily admit your new rank of <HI>Knighthood.</HI> The title is perfectly in cha|racter, and is your own, more by merit than creation. There are Knights of various orders from the Knight of the Windmill to the Knight of the Po&s;t. The former is your patron for exploits, and the latter will a&s;&s;i&s;t you in &s;ettling your accounts. No honorary ti|tle could be more happily applied! The ingenuity is &s;ublime! And your royal ma&s;ter hath di&s;covered more genius in fitting you therewith, than in generating the mo&s;t fini&s;hed figure for a button, or di&s;canting on the properties of a button-mould.</P>
<P>But how, Sir, &s;hall we di&s;po&s;e of you? The inven|tion of the Statuary is exhau&s;ted, and Sir William is yet unprovided with a monument. America is anxi|ous to be&s;tow her funeral favors upon you, and wi&s;hes to do it in a manner that &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h you from all the decea&s;ed heroes of the la&s;t war. The <HI>Egyptian method of embalming</HI> is not known to the pre&s;ent age, and hieroglyphical pageantry hath out-lived the &s;ci|ence
<PB N="65" REF="015951_0004_0F9B23A338E1E7A8">
of decyphering it. Some other method, there|fore, mu&s;t be thought of to immortalize the new Knight of the Windmill and Po&s;t. Sir William, thanks to his &s;tars, is not oppre&s;&s;ed with very delicate ideas. He has no ambition of being wrapt up and handed about in myrrh, aloes and ca&s;&s;ia. Le&s;s charge|able odors will &s;uffice; and it fortunately happen<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, that the &s;imple genius of America hath di&s;covered the art of pre&s;erving bodies and embelli&s;hing them to<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, with much greater frugality than the ancients. In a balmage, Sir, of humble tar, you will be as &s;ecure as Pharoah, and in a hieroglyphic of feathers rival in finery all the mummies of Egypt.</P>
<P>As you have already made your exit from the mo|ral world, and by numberle&s;s acts both of pa&s;&s;ionate and deliberate inju&s;tice engraved an "HERE LYETH" on your decea&s;ed honor, it mu&s;t be meer affectati|on in you to pretend concern at the humours or opi|nions of mankind re&s;pecting you. What remains&punc; of you may expire at any time. The &s;ooner the better. For he who &s;urvives his reputation, lives out of &s;pite to him&s;elf, like a man li&s;tening to his own re|proach.</P>
<P>Thus entombed and ornamented I leave you to the in&s;pection of the curious, and return to the hi&s;tory of your yet &s;urviving actions.&mdash;The character of Sir William hath undergone &s;ome extraordinary revolu|tions &s;ince his arrival in America. It is now fix'd and known; and we have nothing to hope from your candor or to fear from your capacity. Indolence and inability have too large a &s;hare in your compo&s;ition ever to &s;uffer you to be any thing more than the hero of little villainies and unfini&s;hed adventures. That, which to &s;ome per&s;ons appeared moderation in you at fir&s;t, was not produced by any real virtue of your own, but by a contra&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions dividing and holding you in perpetual irre&s;olution. One vice will frequently expel another without the lea&s;t merit in the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">n, as powers in contrary directions reduce each other to re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="015951_0005_0F9B23A3F967EC40">It became you, to have &s;upported a dignified &s;olem|nity of character; to have &s;hewn a &s;uperior liberality of &s;oul; to have won re&s;pect by an ob&s;tinate per&s;e|verance in maintaining order, and to have exhibited, on all occa&s;ions, &s;uch an unchangeable graciou&s;ne&s;s of conduct, that while we beheld in you the re&s;olution of an enemy we might admire in you the &s;incerity of a man. You came to America under the high-&s;ound|ing titles of Commander and Commi&s;&s;ioner; not only to &s;uppre&s;s what you called rebellion by arms, but to &s;hame it out of countenance by the excellence of your example. In&s;tead of which, you have been the patron of low and vulgar frauds, the encourager of Indian cruelties; and have imported a cargo of vices blacker than tho&s;e you pretended to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mankind are not univer&s;ally agreed in their deter|mination of right and wrong; but there are certain actions which the con&s;ent of all nations and individu|als hath branded with the unchangeable name of MEANNESS. In the li&s;t of human vices we find &s;ome of &s;uch a refined con&s;titution, that they cannot be carried into practice without &s;educing &s;ome virtue to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but <HI>meanne&s;s</HI> hath neither alliance nor apology. It is generated in the du&s;t and &s;weepings of other vices, and is of &s;uch a hateful figure that all the re&s;t con&s;pire to di&s;own it. Sir William, the Commi&s;&s;ioner of George the Third, hath at la&s;t vouch&s;afed to give it rank and pedigree. He has placed the fugitive at the Council Board, and dubbed it companion of the order of knighthood.</P>
<P>The particular act of meanne&s;s which I allude to in this de&s;cription, is forgery. You, Sir, have abetted and patroni&s;ed the forging and uttering counterfeit continental bills. In the &s;ame New-York news-papers in which your own proclamation under your ma&s;ter's authority was publi&s;hed, offering, or pretending to offer, pardon and protection to the inhabitants of the&s;e States, there were repeated adverti&s;ements of counterfeit money for &s;ale, and per&s;ons who have come officially from you and under &s;anction of your flag, have been taken up in attempting to put them off.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="015951_0006_0F9B23A4B9A2CA90">A conduct &s;o ba&s;ely mean in a public character is without precedent or pretence. Every nation on earth, whether friends or enemies, will unite in de&s;pi&s;ing you. 'Tis an incendiary war upon &s;ociety which no|thing can excu&s;e or palliate&mdash;An improvement upon beggarly villainy&mdash;and &s;hews an inbred wretchedne&s;s of heart made up between the venomous malignity of a &s;erpent and the &s;piteful imbecility of an inferior reptile.</P>
<P>The laws of any civilized country would condemn you to the gibbet without regard to your rank or titles, becau&s;e it is an action foreign to the u&s;age and cu&s;tom of war; and &s;hould you fall into our hands, which pray God you may, it will be a doubtful mat|ter whether we are to con&s;ider you as a military pri|&s;oner or a pri&s;oner for felony.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is exceedingly unwi&s;e and impolitic in you, or any per&s;ons in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, to promote, or even encourage, or wink at, the crime of forgery in any ca&s;e whatever. Becau&s;e, as the riches of England, as a nation, is chiefly in paper, and the far greater part of trade among individuals is carried on by the &s;ame medium, that is, by notes and drafts on one another, they, therefore, of all people in the world ought to endeavour to keep forgery out of &s;ight, and, if po&s;&s;ible, not to revive the idea of it. It is danger|ous to make men familiar with a crime which they may afterwards practi&s;e to much greater advantage again&s;t tho&s;e who fir&s;t taught them. Several officers in the Engli&s;h army have made their exit at the gal|lows for forgery on their agents; for we all know, who know any thing of England, that there is not a more nece&s;&s;itous body of men, taking them generally, than what the Engli&s;h officers are. They contrive to make a &s;hew at the expence of the taylor, and appear clean at the charge of the wa&s;her-woman.</P>
<P>England hath at this time nearly two hundred mil|lions pounds &s;terling of public money in paper, for which &s;he hath no real property, be&s;ides a large cir|culation of bank notes, bank po&s;t bills, and promi&s;&s;ary
<PB N="68" REF="015951_0007_0F9B23A579230B70">
notes and drafts of private bankers, merchants and trade&s;men. She hath the greate&s;t quantity of paper currency and the lea&s;t quantity of gold and &s;ilver of any nation in Europe; the real &s;pecie, which is about &s;ixteen millions &s;terling, &s;erve only as change in large &s;ums, which are always made in paper, or for pay|ment in &s;mall ones. Thus circum&s;tanced, the nation is put to its wit's ends, and obliged to be &s;evere al|mo&s;t to criminality, to prevent the practice and growth of forgery. Scarcely a &s;e&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;es at the Old Bai|ley, or an execution at Tyburn, but witne&s;&s;eth this truth. Yet you, Sir, regardle&s;s of the policy which her nece&s;&s;ity obliges her to adopt, have made your whole army intimate with the crime. And as all ar|mies, at the conclu&s;ion of a war, are too apt to carry into practice the vices of the campaign, it will pro|bably happen, that England will hereafter abound in forgeries, to which Art, the practitioners were fir&s;t ini|tiated under your authority in America. You, Sir, have the honor of adding a new vice to the military catalogue; and the rea&s;on, perhaps, why the inven|tion was re&s;erved for you, is, becau&s;e no General be|fore was mean enough even to think of it.</P>
<P>That a man who&s;e &s;oul is ab&s;orbed in the low traffic of vulgar vice, is incapable of moving in any &s;uperior region, is clearly &s;hewn in you by the event of every campaign. Your military exploits have been without plan, object or deci&s;ion. Can it be po&s;&s;ible that you or your employers can &s;uppo&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Phila|delphia to be any ways equal to the expence or ex|pectation of the nation which &s;upports you? What advantages does England derive from any atchieve|ments of yours? To <HI>her</HI> it is perfectly indifferent what place you are in, &s;o long as the bu&s;ine&s;s of conque&s;t is unperformed and the charge of maintaining you remains the &s;ame.</P>
<P>If the principal events of the three campaigns be attended to, the balance will appear &s;trongly again&s;t you at the clo&s;e of each; but the la&s;t, in point of importance to us, hath exceeded the former two. It
<PB N="69" REF="015951_0008_0F9B23A71A89CED8">
is plea&s;ant to look back on dangers pa&s;t, and equally as plea&s;ant to meditate on pre&s;ent ones when the way out begins to appear. <HI>That</HI> period is now arrived, and the long doubtful winter of war is changing to the &s;weeter pro&s;pects of victory and joy. At the clo&s;e of the cam|paign in &s;eventy-five, you were obliged to retreat from Bo&s;ton. In the &s;ummer &s;eventy-&s;ix, you appeared with, a numerous fleet and army in the harbour of New-York. By what miracle the Continent was pre&s;erved in that &s;ea&s;on of danger is a &s;ubject of admiration! If in&s;tead of wa&s;ting your time again&s;t Long-I&s;land, you had run up the North River and landed any where above New-York, the con&s;equence mu&s;t have been, that either you would have compelled General Wa&s;hington to fight you with very unequal numbers, or he mu&s;t have &s;uddenly evacu|ated the city with the lo&s;s of nearly all the &s;tores of the army, or have &s;urrendered for want of provi&s;ions, the &s;ituation of the place naturally producing one or other of the&s;e events.</P>
<P>The preparations made to defend New-York were, neverthele&s;s, wi&s;e and military; becau&s;e your forces were then at &s;ea, their numbers uncertain; &s;torms, &s;ickne&s;s, or a variety of accidents might have di&s;abled their coming, or &s;o dimini&s;hed them on their pa&s;&s;age, that tho&s;e which &s;urvived would have been incapa|ble of opening the campaign with any pro&s;pect of &s;uc|ce&s;s; in which ca&s;e, the defence would have been &s;uffici|ent and the place pre&s;erved; for cities that have been rai&s;ed from nothing with an infinitude of labor and ex|pence, are not to be thrown away on the bare probabi|lity of their being taken. On the&s;e grounds, the prepa|rations made to maintain New-York were as judicious as the retreat afterwards. While you, in the interim, let &s;lip the <HI>very</HI> opportunity which &s;eemed to put conque&s;t in your power.</P>
<P>Through the whole of that campaign you had nearly double the forces which General Wa&s;hington immediate|ly commanded. The principal plan, at that time, on our part, was to wear away the &s;ea&s;on with as little lo&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, and to rai&s;e the army for the next year. Long-I&s;land, New-York, Ports Wa&s;hington and Lee were
<PB N="70" REF="015951_0009_0F9B23A7F46FE788">
not defended, after your &s;uperior force was known, un|der any expectation of their being finally maintained, but as a range of out works, in the attacking of which, your time might be wa&s;ted, your numbers reduced, and your vanity amu&s;ed by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them on our retreat. It was intended to have withdrawn the garri&s;on from Fort Wa&s;hington after it had an&s;wered the former of tho&s;e purpo&s;es, but the fate of that day put a prize into your hands without much honour to your&s;elves.</P>
<P>Your progre&s;s through the Jer&s;eys was accidental; you had it not even in contemplation, or you would not have &s;ent &s;o principal a part of your force to Rhode-I&s;land be|fore-hand. The utmo&s;t hope of America in the year &s;e|venty-&s;ix reached no higher than that &s;he might not <HI>then</HI> be conquered. She had no expectation of defeating you in that campaign. Even the mo&s;t cowardly Tory allowed, that, could &s;he with&s;tand the &s;hock of <HI>that</HI> &s;ummer her independence would be pa&s;t a doubt. You had <HI>then</HI> great|ly the advantage of her. You were formidable. Your military knowledge was &s;uppo&s;ed to be compleat. Your fleets and forces arrived without an accident. You had neither experience nor reinforcements to wait for. You had nothing to do but to begin, and your chance lay in the fir&s;t vigorous on&s;et.</P>
<P>America was young and un&s;killed. She was obliged to tru&s;t her defence to time and practice; and hath, by meer dint of per&s;everance, maintained her cau&s;e, and brought her enemy to a condition, in which, &s;he is now capable of meeting him on any grounds.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that in the campaign of &s;eventy-&s;ix, you gained no more, notwith&s;tanding your great force, than what was given you by con&s;ent or evacuation, ex|cept Fort Wa&s;hington: While every advantage obtained by us was by fair and hard fighting. The defeat of Sir Peter Parker was compleat. The conque&s;t of the He&s;&s;i|ans at Trenton by the remains of a retreating army, which, but a few days before, you affected to de&s;pi&s;e, is an in&s;tance of heroic per&s;everance very &s;eldom to be met with. And the victory over the Briti&s;h troops at Prince|ton, by a harra&s;&s;ed and wearied party, who had been engaged the day before and marched all night without refre&s;hment, is attended with &s;uch a &s;cene of circum|&s;tances
<PB N="71" REF="015951_0010_0F9B23A878CD9488">
and &s;uperiority of General&s;hip, as will ever give it a place on the fir&s;t line in the hi&s;tory of great actions.</P>
<P>When I look back on the gloomy days of la&s;t winter and &s;ee America &s;u&s;pended by a thread, I feel a triumph of joy at the recollection of her delivery, and a reverence for the characters which &s;natched her from de&s;truction. To doubt <HI>now</HI> would be a &s;pecies of infidelity, and to forget the in&s;truments which &s;aved us <HI>then</HI> would be in|gratitude.</P>
<P>The clo&s;e of that campaign left us with the &s;pirits of conquerors. The Northern di&s;tricts were relieved by the retreat of General Carleton over the lakes. The army under your command were hunted back and had their bounds pre&s;cribed. The Continent began to feel its mi|litary importance, and the winter pa&s;&s;ed plea&s;antly away in preparations for the next campaign.</P>
<P>However confident you might be on your fir&s;t arrival, the cour&s;e of the year &s;eventy-&s;ix gave you &s;ome idea of the difficulty, if not impo&s;&s;ibility, of conque&s;t. To this rea&s;on I a&s;cribe your delay in opening the campaign in &s;eventy-&s;even. The face of matters, on the clo&s;e of the former year, gave you no encouragement to pur&s;ue a di&s;|cretionary war as &s;oon as the &s;pring admitted the taking the field; for though conque&s;t, in that ca&s;e, would have given you a double portion of &s;ame, yet the experiment was too hazardous. The Mini&s;try, had you failed, would have &s;hifted the whole blame upon you, charged you with having acted without orders, and condemned at once both your plan and your execution.</P>
<P>To avoid tho&s;e misfortunes, which might have involved you and your money accounts in perplexity and &s;u&s;picion, you prudently waited the arrival of a plan of operations from England, which was, that you &s;hould proceed for Philadelphia by the way of Che&s;apeak, and that Bur|goyne, after reducing Ticonderoga, &s;hould take his route by Albany, and, if nece&s;&s;ary, join you.</P>
<P>The &s;plendid laurels of the la&s;t campaign have flou|ri&s;hed in the North. In that quarter America hath &s;ur|prized the world, and laid the foundation of her this year's glory. The conque&s;t of Ticonderoga (if it may be called a conque&s;t) has, like all your other victories,
<PB N="72" REF="015951_0011_0F9B23A938E21688">
led on to ruin. Even the provi&s;ions taken in that for|tre&s;s, (which by General Burgoyne's return was &s;ufficient in bread and flour for nearly 5000 men for ten weeks, and in beef and pork for the &s;ame number of men for one month) &s;erved only to ha&s;ten his overthrow, by enabling him to proceed for Saratoga the place of his de&s;truction. A &s;hort review of the operations of the la&s;t campaign will &s;hew the condition of affairs on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>You have taken Ticonderoga and marched into Phila|delphia. The&s;e are all the events which the year hath produced on your part. A trifling campaign indeed, compared with the expences of England and the conque&s;t of the Continent. On the other &s;ide, a con&s;iderable part of your Northern force has been routed by the New-York militia under General Herkimer. Fort Stanwix hath bravely &s;urvived a compounded attack of &s;oldiers and &s;avages, and the be&s;iegers have fled. The battle of Ben|nington has put a thou&s;and pri&s;oners into our hands, with all their arms, &s;tores, artillery and baggage. Ge|neral Burgoyne in two engagements has been defeated; him&s;elf, his army, and all that were his and theirs are now ours. Ticonderoga and Independence are retaken, and not the &s;hadow of an enemy remains in all the Northern di&s;tricts. At this in&s;tant we have upwards of ele|ven thou&s;and pri&s;oners, between &s;ixty and &s;eventy pieces of bra&s;s ordnance, be&s;ides &s;mall arms, tents, &s;tores, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>In order to know the real value of tho&s;e advantages we mu&s;t rever&s;e the &s;cene, and &s;uppo&s;e General Gates, and the force he commanded, to be at your mercy as pri|&s;oners, and General Burgoyne with his army of &s;oldiers and &s;avages to be already joined to you in Penn&s;ylvania. So di&s;mal a picture can &s;carcely be looked at. It hath all the traces and colourings of horror and de&s;pair; and excites the mo&s;t &s;welling emotions of gratitude by exhi|biting the mi&s;eries we are &s;o graciou&s;ly pre&s;erved from.</P>
<P>I admire this di&s;tribution of laurels around the Conti|nent. It is the earne&s;t of future union. South-Carolina has had her day of &s;uffering and of fame; and the other Southern States have exerted them&s;elves in proportion to the force that invaded or in&s;ulted them. Towards the clo&s;e of the campaign in &s;eventy-&s;ix, the&s;e middle States
<PB N="73" REF="015951_0012_0F9B23A9FAECD6C0">
were called upon and did their duty nobly. They were witne&s;&s;es to the almo&s;t expiring flame of human freedom. It was the clo&s;e &s;truggle of life and death. The line of invi&s;ible divi&s;ion; and on which, the unabated fortitude of a Wa&s;hington prevailed, and &s;aved the &s;park, that has &s;ince blazed in the North with unrivalled lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k, Sir, what great exploits have you per|formed? Through all the variety of changes and oppor|tunities which this war hath produced, I know no one action of yours that can be &s;tiled ma&s;terly. You have moved in and out, backward and forward, round and round, as if valor con&s;i&s;ted in a military jig. The hi&s;tory and figure of your movements would be truly ridiculous could they be ju&s;tly delineated. They re&s;emble the la|bors of a puppy pur&s;uing his tail; the end is &s;till at the &s;ame di&s;tance, and all the turnings round mu&s;t be done over again.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t appearance of affairs at Ticonderoga wore &s;uch an unpromi&s;ing a&s;pect, that it was nece&s;&s;ary, in July, to detach a part of the forces to the &s;upport of that quar|ter, which were otherwi&s;e de&s;tined or intended to act again&s;t you, and this, perhaps, has been the means of po&s;t|poning your downfal to another campaign. The de&s;truc|tion of one army at a time is work enough. We know, Sir, what we are about, what we have to do, and how to do it.</P>
<P>Your progre&s;s from Che&s;apeak was marked by no ca|pital &s;troke of policy or heroi&s;m. Your principal aim was to get General Wa&s;hington between the Delaware and Schuylkill and between Philadelphia and your army. In that &s;ituation, with a river on each of his flanks, which united about five miles below the city, and your army above him, you could have intercepted his rein|forcements and &s;upplies, cut off all his communication with the country, and, if nece&s;&s;ary, have di&s;patched a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to open a pa&s;&s;age for General Burgoyne. This &s;cheme was too vi&s;ible to &s;ucceed, for had General Wa&s;h|ington &s;uffered you to command the open country above him, I think it a very rea&s;onable conjecture that the con|que&s;t of Burgoyne would not have taken place, becau&s;e you could, in that ca&s;e, have relieved him. It was therefore
<PB N="74" REF="015951_0013_0F9B23AAB9406328">
nece&s;&s;ary, while that important victory was in &s;u&s;pence, to trepan <HI>you</HI> into a &s;ituation, in which you could only be on the defen&s;ive without the power of affording him a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The manoeuvre had its effect and Burgoyne was conquered.</P>
<P>There has been &s;omething unmilitarily pa&s;&s;ive in you from the time of your pa&s;&s;ing the Schuylkill and getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia to the clo&s;e of the campaign. You mi&s;took a trap for a conque&s;t, the probability of which has been made known to Europe, and the edge of your triumph taken off by our own information long before.</P>
<P>Having got you into this &s;ituation, a &s;cheme for a ge|neral attack upon you at Germantown was carried into execution on the fourth of October, and though the &s;uc|ce&s;s was not equal to the excellence of the plan, yet the attempting it proved the genius of America to be on the ri&s;e and her power approaching to &s;uperiority The ob&s;curity of the morning was your be&s;t friend, for a fog is always favorable to a hunted enemy. Some weeks after this, you, likewi&s;e, planned an attack on General Wa&s;hington while at Whitemar&s;h, marched out with in|finite parade, but on finding him preparing to attack you the next morning, you prudently cut about and re|treated to Philadelphia with all the precipitation of a man conquered in imagination.</P>
<P>Immediatly after the battle of Germantown, the pro|bability of Burgonye's defeat gave a new policy to affairs in Pen&s;ylvania, and it was judged mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the general &s;afety of America to wait the i&s;&s;ue of the Northern campaign. Slow and &s;ure is &s;ound work. The news of that victory arrived in our camp on the 18th of October, and no &s;ooner did the &s;hout of joy and the re|port of the thirteen cannon reach your ears, than you re&s;olved upon a retreat, and the next day, that is, on the 19th, withdrew your drooping army into Philadel|phia. This movement was evidently dictated by fear; and carried with it a po&s;itive confe&s;&s;ion that you dreaded a &s;econd attack. It was hiding your&s;elf among women and children, and &s;leeping away the choice&s;t part of a campaign in expen&s;ive inactivity. An army in a city can
<PB N="75" REF="015951_0014_0F9B23AB78EA7328">
never be a conquering army. The &s;ituation admits only of defence. It is meer &s;helter; and every military pow|er in Europe will conclude you to be eventually defeated.</P>
<P>The time when you made this retreat was the very time you ought to have fought a battle, in order to put your&s;elf in a condition of recovering in Penn&s;ylvania what you had lo&s;t at Saratoga. And the rea&s;on why you did not, mu&s;t be either prudence or cowardice; the former &s;up|po&s;es your inability, and the latter needs no explanation. I draw no conclu&s;ions, Sir, but &s;uch as are naturally de|duced from known and vi&s;ible facts, and &s;uch as will always have a being while the facts which produced them remain unaltered.</P>
<P>After this retreat a new difficulty aro&s;e which exhi|bited the power of Britain in a very contemptible light, which was the attack and defence of Mud-I&s;land. For &s;everal weeks did that little unfini&s;hed fortre&s;s &s;tand out again&s;t all the attempts of Admiral and General Howe. It was the fable of Bender realized on the Delaware. Scheme after &s;cheme and force upon force were tried and defeated. The garri&s;on, with &s;carce any thing to cover them but their bravery, &s;urvived in the mid&s;t of mud, &s;hot and &s;hells, and were at la&s;t obliged to give it up more to the powers of time and gun-powder than to the military &s;uperiority of the be&s;iegers.</P>
<P>It is my &s;incere opinion that matters are in a much wor&s;e condition with you than what is generally known. Your ma&s;ter's &s;peech at the opening of Parliament is like a &s;oliloquy on ill luck. It &s;hews him to be coming a little to his rea&s;on, for &s;en&s;e of pain is the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of recovery in profound &s;tupefactions. His condition is deplorable. He is obliged to &s;ubmit to all the in&s;ults of France and Spain without daring to know or re&s;ent them, and thankful for the mo&s;t trivial eva&s;ions to the mo&s;t humble remon&s;trances. The time <HI>was</HI> when he could not <HI>deign</HI> an an&s;wer to a petition from America, and the time now <HI>is</HI> when he dare not <HI>give</HI> an an&s;wer to an af|front from France. The capture of Burgoyne's army will &s;ink his con&s;equence as much in Europe as in America. In his &s;peech he expre&s;&s;es his &s;u&s;picions at the warlike preparations of France and Spain, and as he has only
<PB N="76" REF="015951_0015_0F9B23AC3A653030">
the one army which you command to &s;upport his cha|racter in the world with, it remains very uncertain when, or in what quarter, it will be mo&s;t wanted or can be be&s;t employed, and this will partly account for the great care you take to keep it from action and attacks, for &s;hould Burgoyne's fate be yours, which it probably will, England may take her endle&s;s farewell not only of all America but of all the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>Never did a nation invite de&s;truction upon it&s;elf with the eagerne&s;s and ignorance with which Britain has done. Bent upon the ruin of a young and unoffending country, &s;he hath drawn the &s;word that hath wounded her&s;elf to the heart, and in the agony of her re&s;entment hath ap|plied a poi&s;on for a cure. Her conduct towards America is a compound of rage and lunacy; &s;he aims at the go|vernment of it, yet pre&s;erves neither dignity nor cha|racter in her methods to obtain it. Were government a mere manufacture or article of commerce immaterial by whom it &s;hould be made or &s;old, we might as well em|ploy her as another, but when we con&s;ider it as the fountain from whence the general manners and morality of a country take their ri&s;e, that the per&s;ons entru&s;ted with the execution thereof are by their &s;erious example and authority to &s;upport the&s;e principles, how abomina|bly ab&s;urd is the idea of being hereafter governed by a &s;et of men who have been guilty of forgery, perjury, treachery, theft, and every &s;pecies of villainy which the lowe&s;t wretches on earth could practi&s;e or in|vent. What greater public cur&s;e can befal any country than to be under &s;uch authority, and what greater ble&s;&s;|ing than to be delivered therefrom. The &s;oul of any man of &s;entiment would ri&s;e in brave rebellion again&s;t them and &s;purn them from the earth.</P>
<P>The malignant and venemous tempered Gen. Vaughan has amu&s;ed his &s;avage fancy in burning the whole own of King&s;ton, in York government, and the late Governor of that State, Mr. Tryon, in his letter to General Par&s;ons, has endeavoured to ju&s;tify it, and declared his wi&s;h to burn the hou&s;es of every Committee-man in the country. Such a confe&s;&s;ion from one who was once entru&s;ted with the powers of civil government, is a reproach to the cha|racter.
<PB N="77" REF="015951_0016_0F9B23ACF9C1C058">
But it is the wi&s;h and the declaration of a man whom angui&s;h and di&s;appointment have driven to de|&s;pair, and who is daily decaying into the grave with con&s;titutional rottenne&s;s.</P>
<P>There is not in the compa&s;s of language a &s;ufficiency of words to expre&s;s the ba&s;ene&s;s of your King, his Mi|ni&s;try and his Army. They have refined upon villainy till it wants a name. To the fiercer vices of former ages they have added the dregs and &s;cummings of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed ra&s;cality, and are &s;o compleatly &s;unk in &s;erpen|tine deceit, that there is not left among them <HI>one</HI> gene|rous enemy.</P>
<P>From &s;uch men and &s;uch ma&s;ters may the gracious hand of Heaven pre&s;erve America! And though the &s;uf|ferings &s;he now endures are heavy and &s;evere, they are like &s;traws in the wind compared to the weight of evils &s;he would feel under the government of your King, and his pen&s;ioned Parliament.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething in meanne&s;s which excites a &s;pe|cies of re&s;entment that never &s;ub&s;ides, and &s;omething in cruelty which &s;tirs up the heart to the highe&s;t agony of human hatred; Britain hath filled up both the&s;e cha|racters till no addition can be made, and hath not repu|tation left with us to obtain credit for the &s;lighte&s;t pro|mi&s;e. The will of God hath parted us, and the deed is regi&s;tered for eternity. When &s;he &s;hall be a &s;pot &s;carcely vi&s;ible among the nations, America &s;hall flouri&s;h the favorite of Heaven and the friend of mankind.</P>
<P>For the dome&s;tic happine&s;s of Britain and the peace of the world I wi&s;h &s;he had not a foot of land but what is circum&s;cribed within her own i&s;land. Extent of domini|on hath been her ruin, and in&s;tead of civilizing others hath brutalized her&s;elf. Her late reduction of India under Clive and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, was not &s;o properly a conque&s;t as an extermination of mankind. She is the only power who could practi&s;e the prodigal barbarity of tying men to the mouths of loaded cannon and blowing them away. It happens that General Burgoyne, who made the report of that horrid tran&s;action in the Hou&s;e of Commons, is now a pri&s;oner with us, and though an enemy, I can appeal to him for the truth of it, being
<PB N="78" REF="015951_0017_0F9B23ADB8C971F0">
confident that he neither can nor will deny it. Yet Clive received the approbation of the la&s;t Parliament.</P>
<P>When we take a &s;urvey of mankind we cannot help cur&s;ing the wretch, who, to the unavoidable misfortunes of nature &s;hall wilfully add the calamities of war. One would think there were evils enough in the world with|out &s;tudying to increa&s;e them, and that life is &s;ufficient|ly &s;hort without &s;haking the &s;and that mea&s;ures it. The hi&s;tories of Alexander, and Charles of Sweden, are the hi&s;tories of human devils; a good man cannot think of their actions without abhorrence nor of their deaths without rejoicing. To &s;ee the bounties of Heaven de|&s;troyed, the beautiful face of nature laid wa&s;te, and the choice&s;t works of creation and art tumbled into ruin, would fetch a cur&s;e from the &s;oul of piety it&s;elf. But in this country the aggravation is heightened by a new combination of affecting circum&s;tances. America was young, and, compared with other counties, was virtu|ous. None but a Herod of uncommon malice would have made war upon infancy and innocence, and none but a people of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed fortitude dared, under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, have re&s;i&s;ted the tyranny. The natives, or their ance&s;tors, had fled from the former op|pre&s;&s;ions of England, and with the indu&s;try of bees had changed a wilderne&s;s into a habitable world. To Bri|tain they were indebted for nothing. The country was the gift of Heaven, and God alone is their Lord and Sovereign.</P>
<P>The time, Sir, will come when you, in a melancholy hour, &s;hall reckon up your mi&s;eries by your murders in America. Life, with you, begins to wear a clouded a&s;|pect. The vi&s;ion of plea&s;urable delu&s;ion is wearing away, and changing to the barren wild of age and &s;orrow. The poor reflection of having &s;erved your King will yield you no con&s;olation in your parting moments He will crum|ble to the &s;ame undi&s;tingui&s;hed a&s;hes with your&s;elf, and have &s;ins enough of his own to an&s;wer for. It is not the farcical benedictions of a Bi&s;hop, nor the cringing hy|pocri&s;y of a court of Chaplains, nor the formality of an act of Parliament, that can change guilt into innocence, or make the puni&s;hment <HI>one</HI> pang the le&s;s. You may,
<PB N="79" REF="015951_0018_0F9B23AE7ACECB58">
perhaps, be unwilling to be &s;erious, but this de&s;truction of the goods of Providence, this havoc of the human <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and this &s;owing the world with mi&s;chief, mu&s;t be accounted for to him who made and governs it. To us they are only pre&s;ent &s;ufferings, but to him they are deep rebellions.</P>
<P>If there is a &s;in &s;uperior to every other it is that of willful and offen&s;ive war. Mo&s;t other &s;ins are circum&s;cribed within narrow limits, that is, the power of <HI>one</HI> man cannot give them a very general exten&s;ion, and many kind of &s;ins have only a mental exi&s;tence from when no infection ari&s;es; but he who is the author of a war, lets loo&s;e the whole contagion of Hell, and opens a vein that bleeds a nation to death. We leave it to England and Indians to boa&s;t of the&s;e honors; we feel no thir&s;t for &s;uch &s;avage glory; a nobler flame, a purer &s;pirit animates America. She hath taken up the &s;word of virtuous defence; &s;he hath bravely put her&s;elf between Tyranny and Freedom, between a cur&s;e and a ble&s;&s;ing, determined to expel the one, and protect the other.</P>
<P>It is the object only of war that makes it honorable And if there were ever <HI>a ju&s;t</HI> war &s;ince the world began, it is this which America is now engaged in. She invaded no land of yours. She hired no mercenaries to burn your towns, nor Indians to ma&s;|&s;acre their inhabitants. She wanted nothing from you and was indebted for nothing to you; and thus circum&s;tanced, her de|fence is honorable and her pro&s;perity certain.</P>
<P>Yet it is not on the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> only, but likewi&s;e on the <HI>import|ance</HI> of this cau&s;e that I ground my &s;eeming enthu&s;ia&s;tical con|fidence of our &s;ucce&s;s. The va&s;t exten&s;ion of America makes her of too much value in the &s;cale of Providence, to be ca&s;t, like a pearl before &s;wine, at the feet of a European i&s;land; and of much le&s;s con&s;equence would it be that Britain were &s;unk in the &s;ea than that America &s;hould mi&s;carry. There has been &s;uch a chain of extraordinary events in the di&s;covery of this country at fir&s;t, in the peopling and planting it afterwards, in the rearing and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it to its pre&s;ent State, and in the pro|tection of it through the pre&s;ent war, that no man can doubt, but Providence hath &s;ome nobler end to accompli&s;h than the gratification of the petty Elector of Hanover or the ignorant and in&s;ignificant King of Britain.</P>
<P>As the blood of the martyrs hath been the &s;eed of the Chri&s;|tian Church, &s;o the political per&s;ecutions of England will, and
<PB N="80" REF="015951_0019_0F9B23AF390968F0">
hath already enriched America with indu&s;try, experience, uni|on and importance. Before the pre&s;ent aera &s;he was a meer chaos of uncemented Colonies, individually expo&s;ed to the ra|vages of the Indians and the inva&s;ion of any power that Britain &s;hould be at war with. She had nothing &s;he could call her own. Her felicity depended upon accident. The convul&s;ions of Europe might have thrown her from one conqueror to ano|ther, till &s;he had been the &s;lave of all and ruined by every one; for until &s;he had &s;pirit enough to become her own ma&s;ter, there was no knowing to which ma&s;ter &s;he &s;hould belong. <HI>That</HI> pe|riod, thank God, is pa&s;t, and &s;he is no longer the dependent, di&s;united Colonies of Britain, but the independent and united States of America, knowing no ma&s;ter but Heaven and her&s;elf. You or your King may call this "Delu&s;ion," "Rebellion," or what name you plea&s;e. To us it is perfectly indifferent. The i&s;&s;ue will determine the character and Time will give it a name as la&s;ting as his own.</P>
<P>You have now, Sir, tried the fate of three campaigns, and can fully declare to England, that nothing is to be got on your part but blows and broken bones, and nothing on hers but wa&s;te of trade and credit and an encrea&s;e of poverty and taxes. You are now only where you might have been two years ago without the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle &s;hip, and yet not a &s;tep the forwarder towards the conque&s;t of the Continent; becau&s;e, as I have al|ready hinted, "An army in a city can never be a conquering army." The full amount of your lo&s;&s;es &s;ince the beginning of the war exceeds twenty thou&s;and men, be&s;ides millions of trea|&s;ure for which you have nothing in exchange. Our expences, though great, are circulated within our&s;elves. Yours is a direct &s;inking of money, and that from both ends at once, fir&s;t in hiring troops out of the nation, and in paying them afterwards, becau&s;e the money in neither ca&s;e can return again to Britain. We are already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the prize, you only in &s;uit for it. To us it is a real trea&s;ure, to you it would be only an empty triumph. Our expences will repay them&s;elves with ten fold intere&s;t, while yours entail upon you everla&s;ting poverty.</P>
<P>Take a review, Sir, of the ground you have gone over, and let it teach you policy, if it cannot hone&s;ty. You &s;tand but on a very tottering foundation. A charge of the Mini&s;try in Eng|land may probably bring your mea&s;ures into que&s;tion and your head to the block. Clive, with all his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, had &s;ome dif|ficulty
<PB N="81" REF="015951_0020_0F9B23AFF8BB1240">
in e&s;caping, and yours being all a war of lo&s;&s;es, will af|ford you le&s;s preten&s;ions and your enemies more grounds for impeachment.</P>
<P>Go home, Sir, and endeavor to &s;ave the remains of your ruined country by a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of the madne&s;s of her mea&s;ures. A few moments well applied may yet pre&s;erve her from political de&s;truction. I am not one of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;ee Europe in a flame, becau&s;e I am per&s;uaded &s;uch an event will not &s;horten the war. The rupture, at pre&s;ent, is confined between the two powers of America and England. England finds &s;he cannot conquer America, and America has no wi&s;h to conquer England. You are fighting for what you can never obtain, and we defending what we mean never to part with. A few words, therefore, &s;ettle the bargain. Let England mind her own bu&s;ine&s;s and we will mind ours. Govern your&s;elves and we will govern our&s;elves. You may then trade where you plea&s;e unmole&s;ted by us, and we will trade where we plea&s;e un|mole&s;ted by you; and &s;uch articles as we can purcha&s;e of each other better than el&s;ewhere may be mutually done. If it were po&s;&s;ible that you could carry on the war for twenty years you mu&s;t &s;till come to this point at la&s;t, or wor&s;e, and the &s;ooner you think of it the better it will be for you.</P>
<P>My official &s;ituation enables me to know the repeated in&s;ults which Britain is obliged to put up with from foreign powers, and the wretched &s;hifts &s;he is driven to, to glo&s;s them over. Her reduced &s;trength and exhau&s;ted coffers in a three years war with America have given a powerful &s;uperiority to France and Spain. She is not now a match for them&mdash;But if neither coun&s;els can prevail on her to think, nor &s;ufferings awaken her to rea&s;on, &s;he mu&s;t e'en go on, till the honor of England becomes a proverb of contempt, and Europe dub her the Land of Fools.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE INHABITANTS OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>WITH all the plea&s;ure with which a man exchanges bad company for good, I take my leave of Sir William and return to you. It is now nearly three years &s;ince the tyranny of Britain received its fir&s;t repul&s;e by the arms of America. A period, which has given birth to a new world and erected a monument to the folly of the old.</P>
<P>I cannot help being &s;ometimes &s;urpri&s;ed at the complimentary references which I have &s;een and heard made to ancient hi&s;tories and tran&s;actions. The wi&s;dom, civil governments, and &s;en&s;e of honor of the States of Greece and Rome, are frequently held up as objects of excellence and imitation. Mankind have lived for very little purpo&s;e, if, at this period of the world, they mu&s;t go two or three thou&s;and years back for le&s;&s;ons and examples. We do di&s;honorary inju&s;tice to our&s;elves by placing them in &s;uch a &s;uperior line. We have no ju&s;t authority for it, neither can we tell why it is that we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves inferior.</P>
<P>Could the mi&s;t of antiquity be taken away, and men and things viewed as they then really were, it is more than proba|ble that they would admire us, rather than we them. America has &s;urmounted a greater variety and combination of difficulties than, I believe, ever &s;ell to the &s;hare of any one people in the &s;ame &s;pace of time, and has repleni&s;hed the world with more u&s;eful knowledge and founder maxims of civil government than were ever produced in any age before. Had it not been for Ame|rica there had been no &s;uch thing as freedom left throughout the whole univer&s;e. England hath lo&s;t hers in a long chain of right rea&s;oning from wrong principles, and it is from this country now &s;he mu&s;t learn the re&s;olution to redre&s;s her&s;elf, and the wi&s;dom Low.</P>
<P>The Grecians and Romans were &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of liberty but <HI>not</HI> the <HI>principle,</HI> for at the time they were determined not to be &s;laves them&s;elves, they employ|ed their power to en&s;lave the re&s;t of mankind. But this di&s;tingui&s;hed aera is blotted by no one mi&s;anthropical vice. In &s;hort, if the principle on which the cau&s;e is founded, the univer&s;al ble&s;&s;ings that are to ari&s;e from it, the difficulties that accompanied it, the wi&s;dom with which it has been debated, the fortitude by which it has been &s;upported, the &s;trength of the power we had to oppo&s;e, and the condition in which we un|dertook
<PB N="83" REF="015951_0022_0F9B23B178C416D8">
it, be all taken in one view, we may ju&s;tly &s;tile it the mo&s;t virtuous and illu&s;trious revolution that ever graced the hi&s;tory of mankind.</P>
<P>A good opinion of our&s;elves is exceedingly nece&s;&s;ary in pri|vate life, but ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in public life, and of the ut|mo&s;t importance in &s;upporting natural character. I have no notion of yielding the palm of the United States to any Grecians or Romans that were ever born. We have equalled the brave&s;t in times of danger, and excelled the wi&s;e&s;t in the con&s;truction of civil governments, <HI>no one in America excepted.</HI></P>
<P>From this agreeable eminence let us take a review of pre&s;ent affairs. The &s;pirit of corruption is &s;o in&s;eparably interwoven with Briti&s;h politics, that their Mini&s;try &s;uppo&s;e all mankind are governed by the &s;ame motive. They have no idea of a people &s;ubmitting even to temporary inconvenience from an attachment to rights and privileges. Their plans of bu&s;ine&s;s are calculated <HI>by</HI> the hour and <HI>for</HI> the hour, and are uniform in nothing but the corruption which gives them birth. They never had, nei|ther have they at this time, any regular plan for the conque&s;t of America by arms. They know not how to go about it, nei|ther have they power to effect it if they could know. The thing is not within the compa&s;s of human practicability, for America is too exten&s;ive either to be fully conquered or <HI>pa&s;&s;ively</HI> defended. But &s;he may be <HI>actively</HI> defended by defeating or mak|ing pri&s;oners of the army that invades her. And this is the only &s;y&s;tem of defence that can be effectual in a large country.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething in a war carried on by inva&s;ion which makes it differ in circum&s;tances from any other mode of war, becau&s;e he who conducts it cannot tell whether the ground he gains, be for him, or again&s;t him, when he fir&s;t makes it. In the winter &s;eventy &s;ix General Howe marched with an air of victory through the Jer&s;eys, the con&s;equence of which was his defeat and General Burgoyne at Saratega experienced the &s;ame fate from the &s;ame cau&s;e. The Spaniards about two years ago were defeated by the Algerines in the &s;ame manner, that is, their fir&s;t triumphs became a trap in which they were totally routed. And whoever will attend to the circum&s;tances and events of a war carried on by inva&s;ion, will find, that any in|vader, in order to be finally conquered mu&s;t fir&s;t begin to conquer.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s my&s;elf one of tho&s;e who believe the lo&s;s of Phila|delphia to be attended with more advantages than injuries. The
<PB N="84" REF="015951_0023_0F9B23B239BB9638">
ca&s;e &s;tood thus. The enemy imagined Philadelphia to be of more importance to us than it really was; for we all know that it had long cea&s;ed to be a port, not a cargo of goods had been brought into it for near a twelve month, nor any fix'd manu|factories, nor even &s;hip building carried on in it; yet as the enemy believed the conque&s;t of it to be practicable, and to that belief added the ab&s;urd idea that the &s;oul of all America was centered there and would be conquered there, it naturally fol|lows, that their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, by not an&s;wering the end propo&s;ed, mu&s;t break up the plans they had &s;o fooli&s;hly gone upon, and either oblige them to form a new one, for which their pre&s;ent &s;trength is not &s;ufficient, or to give over the attempt.</P>
<P>We never had &s;o &s;mall an army to fight again&s;t, nor &s;o fair an opportunity of final &s;ucce&s;s as <HI>now.</HI> The death wound is already given. The day is our own if we follow it up. The enemy by his &s;ituation is within our reach, and by his reduced &s;trength is within our power. The Mini&s;ters of Britain may rage as they plea&s;e, but our part is to conquer their armies. Let them wrangle and welcome, but let it not draw our atten|tion from the <HI>one</HI> thing needful. <HI>Here,</HI> in <HI>this</HI> &s;pot is our bu&s;i|ne&s;s to be accompli&s;hed, our felicity &s;ecured. What we have now to do is as clear as light, and the way to do it is as &s;trait as a line. It needs not to be commented upon, yet, in order to be perfectly under&s;tood, I will put a ca&s;e that cannot admit of a mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Had the armies under the Generals Howe and Burgoyne been united and taken po&s;t at Germantown, and had the Northern army under General Gates been joined to that under General Wa&s;hington at Whitemar&s;h, the con&s;equence would have been a general action; and if in that action we had killed and taken the &s;ame number of officers and men, that is, between nine and ten thou&s;and, with the &s;ame quantity of artillery, arms, &s;tores, &amp;c. as have been taken to the Northward, and obliged General Howe with the remains of his army, that is, with the &s;ame number he now commands, to take &s;helter in Philadelphia, we &s;hould certainly have thought our&s;elves the greate&s;t heroes in the world; and &s;hould, as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on permitted, have collected together all the force of the Continent and laid &s;iege to the city, for it requires a much greater force to be&s;iege an ene|my in a town than to defeat them in the field. The ca&s;e <HI>now</HI> is ju&s;t the &s;ame as if it had been produced by the means I have
<PB N="85" REF="015951_0024_0F9B23B2F94C4A08">
here &s;uppo&s;ed. Between nine and ten thou&s;and have been killed and taken, all their &s;tores are in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and General Howe, in con&s;equence of that victory, has thrown him&s;elf for &s;helter into Philadelphia He, or his trifling friend Galloway, may form what pretences they plea&s;e, yet no ju&s;t rea&s;on can be given for their going into winter quarters &s;o early as the 19th of October, but their apprehen&s;ion of a defeat if they continued out, or their con&s;cious inability of keeping the field with &s;afety. I &s;ee no advantage which can ari&s;e to America by hunting the enemy from State to State It is a triumph without a prize, and wholly unworthy the attention of a people determined to conquer. Neither can any State promi&s;e it&s;elf &s;ecurity while the enemy remain in a condition to tran&s;port them&s;elves from one part of the Continent to another. Howe likewi&s;e, cannot conquer where we have no army to oppo&s;e, therefore any &s;uch removals in him are mean and cowardly, and reduces Britain to a common pil&s;erer. If he retreats from Philadelphia, he will be de&s;pi&s;ed; if he &s;tays, he may be &s;hut up and &s;tarved out, and the country, if he advances into it, may become his Saratoga. He has his choice of evils and we of opportunities. If he moves early, it is not only a &s;ign but a proof that he expects no rein|forcement, and his delays will prove that he either waits for the arrival of a plan to go upon, or force to execute it, or both; in <HI>which</HI> ca&s;e, our &s;trength will encrea&s;e more than his, therefore in <HI>any</HI> ca&s;e we cannot be wrong if we do but proceed</P>
<P>The particular condition of Penn&s;ylvania de&s;erves the atten|tion of all the other States. Her military &s;trength mu&s;t not be e&s;timated by the number of inhabitants. Here are men of all nations, characters, profe&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts. Here are the firme&s;t Whigs, &s;urviving like &s;parks in the ocean&punc; unquenched and uncooled in the mid&s;t of di&s;couragement and di&s;affection&punc; Here are men lo&s;ing their all with chearfulne&s;s, and collecting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and fortitude from the flames of their own e&s;tates. Here are others &s;kulking in &s;ecret, many making a market of the times, and numbers who are changing Whig and Tory with the circum&s;tances or every day.</P>
<P>It is by meer dint of fortitude and per&s;everance that the Whigs of this State have been able to maintain &s;o good a coun|tenance, and do even what they have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. We want help, and the &s;ooner it can arrive the more effectual it will be. The invaded State, be it which it may, will always feel and additi|onal
<PB N="86" REF="015951_0025_0F9B23B3B9F320F8">
burthen upon its back, and be hard &s;et to &s;upport its civil power with &s;ufficient authority: and this difficulty will always ri&s;e or fall, in proportion as the other States throw in their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The enemy will mo&s;t probably make many manoeuvres at the opening of this campaign, to amu&s;e and draw off the attention of the &s;everal States from the <HI>one thing needful.</HI> We may ex|pect to hear of alarms and pretended expeditions to <HI>this</HI> place and <HI>that</HI> place, to the Southward, the Ea&s;tward and the Northward, all intended to prevent our forming into one for|midable body. The le&s;s the enemy's &s;trength is, the more &s;ub|tleties of this kind will they make u&s;e of. Their exi&s;tence de|pends upon it, becau&s;e the force of America, when collected, is &s;ufficient to &s;wallow their pre&s;ent army up. It is therefore our bu&s;ine&s;s to make &s;hort work of it, by bending our whole attention to <HI>this one principal point,</HI> for the in&s;tant that the main body under General Howe is defeated, all the inferior alarms throughout the Continent, like &s;o many &s;hadows, will follow his downfall.</P>
<P>The only way to fini&s;h a war with the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible blood&s;hed, or perhaps without any, is to collect an army, again&s;t the pow|er of which, the enemy &s;hall have no chance. By not doing this, we prolong the war, and double both the calamities and the expences of it. What a rich and happy country would America be, were &s;he, by a vigorous exertion, to reduce Howe as &s;he has reduced Burgoyne. Her currency would ri&s;e to millions beyond its pre&s;ent value. Every man would be rich, and every man would have it in his power to be happy. And why not do the&s;e things? What is there to hinder? America is her own mi&s;tre&s;s and can do what &s;he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>If we had not at this time a man in the field, we could, ne|verthele&s;s, rai&s;e an army in a few weeks &s;ufficient to overwhelm all the force which General Howe at pre&s;ent commands. Vi|gor and determination will do any thing and every thing. We began the war with this kind of &s;pirit, why not end it with the &s;ame? Here, Gentlemen, is the enemy. Here is the army. The intere&s;t, the happine&s;s, of all America is centered in this half ruined &s;pot. Come on and help us. Here are laurels, come and &s;hare them. Here are Tories, come and help us to expel them. Here are Whigs that will make you welcome, and enemies that dread your coming.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="015951_0026_0F9B23B478D08E40">The wor&s;t of all policy is that of doing things by halves. Penny-wi&s;e and pound fooli&s;h has been the ruin of thou&s;ands. The pre&s;ent &s;pring, if rightly improved, will free us from all our troubles, and &s;ave us the expence of millions. We have now only one army to cope with. No opportunity can be fairer; no pro&s;pect more promi&s;ing. I &s;hall conclude this paper with a few outlines of a plan either for filling up the battalions with expedition, or for rai&s;ing an additional force for any limited time, on any &s;udden emergency.</P>
<P>That in which every man is intere&s;ted is every man's duty to &s;upport. And any burthen which falls equally on all men, and, from which every man is to receive an equal benefit, is con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t perfect ideas of liberty. I would wi&s;h to revive &s;omething of that virtuous animation which fir&s;t called America into the field. Then every man was eager to do his part, and perhaps the principal rea&s;on why we have in any de|gree fallen therefrom, is, becau&s;e we did not &s;et a &s;ufficient value by it at fir&s;t, but left it to blaze out of it&s;elf, in&s;tead of regulating and pre&s;erving it by ju&s;t proportions of re&s;t and &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e any State who&s;e number of effective inhabitants were 80,000, &s;hould be required to furni&s;h 3200 men towards the defence of the Continent on any very &s;udden emergency.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Let the whole number of effective inhabitants be di|vided into hundreds; then if each of tho&s;e hundreds turn out four men, the whole number of 3200 will be had.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, Let the names of each hundred men be entered in a book, and let four dollars be collected from each man, with as much more as any of the gentlemen who&s;e abilities can afford it &s;hall plea&s;e to throw in, which gifts &s;hall likewi&s;e be entered again&s;t the donors names.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, Let the &s;ums &s;o collected be offered as a pre&s;ent, over and above the bounty of twenty dollars, to any four who may be inclined to propo&s;e them&s;elves as volunteers; if more than four offer, the majority of the &s;ub&s;cribers pre&s;ent &s;hall deter|mine which; if none offers, then four out of the hundred &s;hall be taken by lot, who &s;hall be entitled to the &s;aid &s;ums, and &s;hall either go, or provide others that will, in the &s;pace of &s;ix days.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, As it will always happen, that in the &s;pace of ground on which any hundred men &s;hall live, there will always be a number of per&s;ons who, by age and infirmity, are incapable of
<PB N="88" REF="015951_0027_0F9B23B5396F9D00">
doing per&s;onal &s;ervice, and as &s;uch per&s;ons are generally po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t part of the property in any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> their portion of &s;ervice, therefore will be to furni&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> with a blanket, which will make a regimental coat jacket and breeches, or cloaths in lien thereof, and another for a watch cloak and two pair of &s;hoes&mdash;for however <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> people may be of the&s;e things matters not in ca&s;es of this kind&mdash;Tho&s;e who live a ways in hou&s;es can find many ways to keep them <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> warm, but it is a &s;hame and a &s;in to &s;uffer a &s;oldier in the field to want a blanket while there is one in the country.</P>
<P>Should the cloathing not be wanted, the &s;uperannuated or infirm per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing property, may, in lieu thereof, throw in their money &s;ub&s;criptions towards encrea&s;ing the bounty, for though age will naturally exempt a per&s;on from per&s;onal &s;ervice, it cannot exempt him from his &s;hare of the charge, becau&s;e the men are rai&s;ed for the defence of property and liberty jointly.</P>
<P>There never was a &s;cheme again&s;t which objections might not be rai&s;ed. But this alone is not a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for re|jection. The only line to judge truly upon, is, to draw out and admit all the objections which can fairly be made, and place again&s;t them all the contrary qualities, conveniences and ad|vantages, then by &s;triking a balance you come at the true cha|racter of any &s;cheme, principle or po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t material advantages of the plan here <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> ea&s;e, expedition, and cheapne's; yet the men &s;o rai&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a much larger bounty than is any where at pre&s;ent given; becau&s;e all the expences, extravagance, and con&s;equent idlene&s;s of re|cruiting are &s;aved or prevented. The country incurs up new debt, nor intere&s;t thereon; the whole matter being all &s;et|tled at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and entirely done with. It is a &s;ub&s;cription an&s;wer|ing all the purpo&s;es of a tax, without either the charge or trouble of collecting. The men are ready for the field with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible expo&s;ition, becau&s;e it becomes the duty of the inhabitants them&s;elves, in every part of the country, to find up their proportion of men, in&s;tead of leaving it to a recruiting Serjeant, who, be he ever &s;o indu&s;trious, cannot know always where to apply.</P>
<P>I do not propo&s;e this as a regular dige&s;ted plan, neither will the limits of this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> admit of any further remarks upon it. I believe it to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> capable of much improvement, and as &s;uch &s;ubmit it to the Public.</P>
