<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE <HI>AMERICAN</HI> REVOLUTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE efforts of Great-Britain to reduce the&s;e United States being now almo&s;t brought to a period; it is proper that the citizens of America &s;hould look over the ground they have trodden. This becomes nece&s;&s;ary in order that the pre&s;ent generation may fully comprehend tho&s;e two points which po&s;terity indeed will perceive at a &s;ingle glance, but which it is of im|portance to the con&s;ciences of men to be well informed of now. For certainly it becomes us to know that the conte&s;t which hath emancipated our country, originated with our enemies, and hath been by them urged on for the purpo&s;es of domination: while on our part every &s;tep hath been taken con&s;i&s;tent with po&s;&s;ible &s;afety to deprecate their vengeance and avert the calamities of war.</P>
<P>FOR the better under&s;tanding this important &s;ubject, we mu&s;t take a cur&s;ory view of the Briti&s;h colonies before the revolution, previous to which it may be nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome few remarks on the circum&s;tance of coloni|zation. This tho' it introduced new incidents not to be met with in the antient hi&s;tories of human affairs, neither did or could introduce any new rea&s;on or new maxims of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE great principle therefore is and ever will remain in force, that MEN ARE BY NATURE FREE. As ac|countable to him that made them, they mu&s;t be &s;o; and &s;o long as we have any idea of divine ju&s;tice, we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ociate that of human freedom. Whether men can <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with their liberty is among the que&s;tions which have
<PB N="2" REF="016625_0003_0F9D7027EB322AA0">
exerci&s;ed the able&s;t writers: but it is conceded on all hands, that the right to be free can never be alienated. Still le&s;s is it practicable for one generation to mortgage the privileges of another. The right of a &s;tate over its own members hath al&s;o been brought into que&s;tion; and there are not wanting authorities to &s;hew, that citizens who renounce allegiance and protection may fly from the territories of the &s;tate, and erect new independent go|vernments in new countries. Be this as it may, the point is clear that when the con&s;ent of government is obtained, the individuals are again in a &s;tate of nature; alike free either to &s;ubmit to a &s;ociety exi&s;ting or to e&s;tabli&s;h one, as their intere&s;t or their inclination may prompt. Here then is the &s;ituation of tho&s;e who wearied with the con|tentions and oppre&s;&s;ions of the old world, boldly threw them&s;elves upon the protection of Providence to explore the new, and traver&s;ed the ocean to inhabit a wilderne&s;s amid nations of barbarous foes. The&s;e fir&s;t adventurers, in&s;pired by freedom, &s;upported by indu&s;try, and protected by Heaven, became inured to toil, to hard&s;hip, and to war. In &s;pite therefore of every ob&s;tacle they obtained a &s;ettlement; and then turned their attention to the &s;ecurity of tho&s;e equal rights for which they had encountered &s;o many perils and inconveniencies. For this purpo&s;e they framed independent con&s;titutions; and the&s;e however dif|ferent in form, were all in&s;pired by the &s;ame &s;pirit, and all founded on that eternal maxim of free governments, that no man can be bound by laws to which he does not con&s;ent. The&s;e little republics &s;oon began to flouri&s;h with a vigor and beauty adequate to the radical energy of their fir&s;t principle. Of con&s;equence they became a de|&s;irable object to that genius of enterprize which had animated the monarchies of Europe. On the other hand, their weakne&s;s required &s;ome antient trunk to &s;upport them for a while in the &s;torm of ambition. Our ance&s;tors therefore, &s;timulated by their nece&s;&s;ities, and &s;educed by ancient habits, and the remembrance of former friend&s;hips and connections, were ea&s;ily prevailed on to &s;ubject them|&s;elves to the king of England, in con&s;equence of his &s;olemn promi&s;e to afford them protection in common with all his other &s;ubjects again&s;t foreign force and internal violence. The Briti&s;h colonies then, under that name,
<PB N="3" REF="016625_0004_0F9D7028BB63E350">
were in fact &s;o many independent &s;tates, who&s;e only po|litical connection with each other and with the &s;everal parts of the Briti&s;h empire, was by means of a common &s;overeign. It followed from their natural and political &s;ituation that this connection could not be permanent, and indeed the fabric mu&s;t have crumbled to pieces at a much earlier period if it had not been cemented by the &s;amene&s;s of manners and language, a &s;triking &s;imilarity of civil in&s;titutions, a continued intercour&s;e for the pur|po&s;es of commerce and other circum&s;tances of the like kind. For the intere&s;ts of Great-Britain and America were diametrically oppo&s;ite, whether we con&s;ider them either in a political or commercial view. It was for in|&s;tance the intere&s;t of Great-Britain, that needy dependents there &s;hould rebuild their &s;hattered fortunes here, and the wealthy citizens of this country expend their property at the metropolis. That we &s;hould be obliged to take part in all their wars whether for defence or conque&s;t. That our trade &s;hould be confined to their ports; and finally, that they &s;hould have a power by laws pa&s;&s;ed in their par|liament to bind us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever; and not only did the difference of intere&s;ts work to this end, but nature had &s;o widely &s;eparated the two countries, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible they could long have been joined together upon terms even of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>FROM what hath already been &s;aid it mu&s;t appear, that as a free people we could not be bound by arbitrary edicts of the prince, that by &s;till &s;tronger rea&s;ons we could not be bound by the more arbitrary edicts of our fellow &s;ubjects; and of con&s;equence, that altho' the prince and our fellow &s;ubjects &s;hould join again&s;t us whatever force they might acquire, they could acquire no right by the union. But it will appear al&s;o, that we had on every principle a right to become independent, particularly if the crown &s;hould violate tho&s;e contracts which formed the ba&s;is of an union. For let us &s;uppo&s;e that when our ance|&s;tors quitted Europe, they went on the general principle of di&s;claiming allegiance to and protection from the &s;everal &s;tates of which they were &s;ubjects, or that they came hither with the permi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e &s;tates, and even under a con|tract with the king of England. And when they arrived
<PB N="4" REF="016625_0005_0F9D70296ABDBA08">
here, let us &s;uppo&s;e either that they e&s;tabli&s;hed independent governments which afterwards became &s;ubject by agree|ment, or that a conditional &s;ubjection was interwoven in their frame;&mdash;&s;till the exi&s;tence of the contract remains unimpeached; or even on a &s;uppo&s;ition that they had actu|ally bargained for unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;till that bar|gain would have been from its very nature void as to them; or if not to them, at lea&s;t to their off&s;pring; and of con&s;e|quence from the principle of all free &s;ocieties, the contract will &s;till re&s;ult. And it being evident that the two coun|tries not only had not, but really could not have (on free principles) any political connection but thro' the prince&mdash;&s;o that right exerci&s;ed in the revolution of England de|mon&s;trated &s;ince, and generally admitted, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily draw with it the right to independence, which is above &s;tated.</P>
<P>PREVIOUS to the la&s;t war a few acts were pa&s;&s;ed in England infringing on the liberties of America; and but a few for the two following rea&s;ons, 1&s;t. Becau&s;e Ame|rica was at that time an object of very little national attention. 2dly. Becau&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the French enabled them to give &s;uch effectual aid in ca&s;e of rupture, that it was imprudent to tempt us too far. The&s;e acts however were obeyed, becau&s;e the re&s;traints were of no great con&s;equence; and becau&s;e we were too &s;en&s;ible of our weakne&s;s to be fully &s;en&s;ible of our rights, or at lea&s;t to vindicate them. But during the cour&s;e of the war, the weight and magnitude of America became vi&s;ible; and at the peace, this great object was (or at lea&s;t &s;eemed to be) in&s;eparably annexed to the crown of Britain. On the other hand, we had felt our own force, and were relieved from a neighbour who&s;e views at that time cramped our growth and repre&s;&s;ed our efforts. The con&s;equence of this change was in&s;tantly perceived. Great-Britain claimed revenue and dominion. We refu&s;ed the one, and di&s;puted the other.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory which Congre&s;s gave in their addre&s;s to America of October 1774, will on this occa&s;ion de&s;erve our &s;erious attention. It is as follows: "Soon after the conclu&s;ion of the late war, there commenced a memorable
<PB N="5" REF="016625_0006_0F9D702A32A6EF28">
change in the treatment of the&s;e colonies. By a &s;tatute made in the fourth year of the pre&s;ent reign, a time of <HI>profound peace,</HI> alleging "the expediency of new provi|&s;ions and regulations for extending the commerce between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and his maje&s;ty's dominions in <HI>America,</HI> and the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing a revenue</HI> in the &s;aid dominions for de|fraying the expences of <HI>defending,</HI> protecting, and &s;ecuring the &s;ame," the <HI>commons of Great-Britain</HI> undertook to <HI>give</HI> and <HI>grant</HI> to his maje&s;ty many rates and duties, to be paid in the&s;e colonies. To enforce the ob&s;ervance of this act, it pre&s;cribes a great number of &s;evere penalties and forfei|tures; and in two &s;ections makes a remarkable di&s;tinction between the &s;ubjects in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and tho&s;e in <HI>America.</HI> By the one the penalties and forfeitures incurred there are to be recovered in any of the king's courts of record at We&s;tmin&s;ter, or in the court of exchequer in Scotland; and by the other, the penalties and forfeitures incurred here are to be recovered in any court of record, or in any court of admiralty, or vice admiralty, at the election of the informer or pro&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of the&s;e colonies, confiding in the ju&s;tice of Great-Britain, were &s;carcely allowed &s;ufficient time to receive and con&s;ider this act before another, well known by the name of the &s;tamp act, and pa&s;&s;ed in the fifth year of this reign, engro&s;&s;ed their whole attention. By this &s;tatute the Briti&s;h parliament exerci&s;ed in the mo&s;t explicit manner a power of taxing us, and extending the juri&s;diction of courts of admiralty and vice admiralty in the colonies to matters ari&s;ing within the body of a county, and directed the numerous penalties and forfeitures thereby inflicted to be recovered in the &s;aid courts.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame year a tax was impo&s;ed upon us by an act e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;everal new fees in the cu&s;toms. In the next year the &s;tamp act was repealed; not becau&s;e it was founded in an erroneous principle, but as the repealing act recites, becau&s;e the <Q>continuance thereof would be attended with many inconveniencies, and might be productive of con|&s;equences greatly detrimental to the commercial intere&s;t of Great-Britain.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016625_0007_0F9D702AE9D044F8">IN the &s;ame year and by a &s;ub&s;equent act it was declared, <Q>that his maje&s;ty in parliament of right had power to bind the people of the&s;e colonies by &s;tatutes in all ca&s;es what|&s;oever.</Q></P>
<P>IN the &s;ame year another act was pa&s;&s;ed, for impo&s;ing rates and duties payable in the&s;e colonies. In this &s;tatute the commons avoiding the terms of giving and granting, <Q>humbly be&s;ought his maje&s;ty that it might be enacted, &amp;c.</Q> But from a declaration in the preamble, that the rates and duties were "in lieu of" &s;everal others granted by the &s;tatute fir&s;t before mentioned for rai&s;ing a revenue, and from &s;ome other expre&s;&s;ions it appears that the&s;e duties were intended for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IN the next year, [1767] an act was made <Q>to enable his maje&s;ty to put the cu&s;toms and other duties in Ame|rica under the management of commi&s;&s;ioners, &amp;c.</Q> And the king thereupon erected the pre&s;ent expen&s;ive board of commi&s;&s;ioners, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of car|rying into execution the &s;everal acts relating to the revenue and trade in America.</P>
<P>AFTER the repeal of the &s;tamp act, having again re|&s;igned our&s;elves to our ancient un&s;u&s;picious affections for the parent &s;tate, and anxious to avoid any controver&s;y with her, in hopes of a favourable alteration in &s;entiments and mea&s;ures towards us, we did not pre&s;s our objections again&s;t the above mentioned &s;tatutes made &s;ub&s;equent to that repeal.</P>
<P>ADMINISTRATION, attributing to trifling cau&s;es a con|duct that really proceeded from generous motives, were encouraged in the &s;ame year [1767] to make a bolder experiment on the patience of America.</P>
<P>BY a &s;tatute commonly called the gla&s;s, paper and tea act, made fifteen months after the repeal of the &s;tamp act, the commons of Great-Britain re&s;umed their former language, and again undertook to <Q>give and grant rates and duties to be paid in the&s;e colonies,</Q> for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of <Q>rai&s;ing a revenue to defray the charges of the admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice, the &s;upport of civil government, and
<PB N="7" REF="016625_0008_0F9D702BAAD3F188">
defending the king's dominions</Q> on this continent. The penalties and forfeitures incurred under this &s;tatute, are to be recovered in the &s;ame manner with tho&s;e men|tioned in the foregoing acts.</P>
<P>TO this &s;tatute &s;o naturally tending to di&s;turb the tran|quillity then univer&s;al throughout the colonies, parliament in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion added another no le&s;s extraordinary.</P>
<P>EVER &s;ince the making the pre&s;ent peace, a &s;tanding army has been kept in the&s;e colonies: from re&s;pect for the mother country the innovation was not only tolerated, but the provincial legi&s;latures generally made provi&s;ion for &s;upplying the troops.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;embly of the province of New-York, having pa&s;&s;ed an act of this kind, but differing in &s;ome articles from the directions of the act of parliament made in the fifth year of this reign, the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives in that colony was prohibited by a &s;tatute made in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion mentioned, from making any bill, order, re&s;olution, or vote, except for adjourning or chu&s;ing a &s;peaker, until provi&s;ion &s;hould be made by the &s;aid a&s;&s;embly for furni&s;hing the troops within that province not only with all &s;uch ne|ce&s;&s;aries as were required by the &s;tatute which they were charged with di&s;obeying, but al&s;o with tho&s;e required by two other &s;ub&s;equent &s;tatutes, which were declared to be in force until the twenty-fourth day of March, 1769.</P>
<P>THESE &s;tatutes of the year 1767, revived the appre|hen&s;ions and di&s;contents that had entirely &s;ub&s;ided on the repeal of the &s;tamp act; and amid&s;t the ju&s;t fears and jealou&s;ies thereby occa&s;ioned, a &s;tatute was made in the next year [1768] to e&s;tabli&s;h courts of admiralty and vice admiralty on a new model, expre&s;sly for the end of more effectually recovering of the penalties and forfeitures in|flicted by acts of parliament, framed for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue in America, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE immediate tendency of the&s;e &s;tatutes is, to &s;ub|vert the right of having a &s;hare in legi&s;lation, by rendering a&s;&s;emblies u&s;ele&s;s; the right of property, by taking the money of the coloni&s;ts without their con&s;ent; the right of
<PB N="8" REF="016625_0009_0F9D702C6B289D50">
trial by jury, by &s;ub&s;tituting in their place trials in ad|miralty and vice admiralty courts, where &s;ingle judges pre&s;ide, holding their commi&s;&s;ions during plea&s;ure; and unduly to influence the courts of common law, by ren|dering the judges thereof totally dependent on the crown for their &s;alaries.</P>
<P>THESE &s;tatutes, not to mention many others exceed|ingly exceptionable, compared one with another, will be found not only to form a regular &s;y&s;tem, in which every part has great force, but al&s;o a pertinacious adherence to that &s;y&s;tem for &s;ubjugating the&s;e colonies, that are not, and from local circum&s;tances cannot be repre&s;ented in the hou&s;e of commons, to the uncontroulable and unlimited power of parliament, in violation of their undoubted rights and liberties&mdash;in contempt of their humble and repeated &s;upplications.</P>
<P>SEVERE as the acts of parliament before mentioned are, yet the conduct of admini&s;tration hath been equally injurious, and irritating to this devoted country.</P>
<P>UNDER pretence of governing them, &s;o many new in|&s;titutions uniformly rigid and dangerous have been intro|duced, as could only be expected from incen&s;ed ma&s;ters, for collecting the tribute or rather the plunder of conquered provinces.</P>
<P>BY an order of the king, the authority of the com|mander in chief, and under him of the brigadier generals, in time of peace, is rendered &s;upreme in all the civil go|vernments in America; and thus an uncontroulable mili|tary power is ve&s;ted in officers not known to the con&s;ti|tution of the&s;e colonies.</P>
<P>A LARGE body of troops, and a con&s;iderable armament of &s;hips of war, have been &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t in taking their money without their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>EXPENSIVE and oppre&s;&s;ive offices have been multiplied, and the acts of corruption indu&s;triou&s;ly practi&s;ed to divide and de&s;troy.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="016625_0010_0F9D702D2954F690">THE judges of the admiralty and vice admiralty courts are impowered to receive their &s;alaries and fees from the effects to be condemned by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms are impowered to break open and enter hou&s;es without the authority of any civil magi&s;trate founded on legal information.</P>
<P>JUDGES of courts of common law have been made en|tirely dependent on the crown for their commi&s;&s;ions and &s;alaries.</P>
<P>A COURT has been e&s;tabli&s;hed at Rhode-I&s;land, for the purpo&s;e of taking coloni&s;ts to England to be tried.</P>
<P>HUMBLE and rea&s;onable petitions from the repre&s;enta|tives of the people, have been frequently treated with contempt: and a&s;&s;emblies have been repeatedly and arbi|trarily di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>FROM &s;ome few in&s;tances it will &s;ufficiently appear, on what pretences of ju&s;tice tho&s;e di&s;&s;olutions have been founded.</P>
<P>THE tranquillity of the colonies having been again di&s;turbed, as has been mentioned, by the &s;tatutes of the year 1767, the earl of Hill&s;borough, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in a letter to governor Bernard, dated April 22, 1768, cen&s;ures the "pre&s;umption" of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives for <Q>re&s;olving upon a mea&s;ure of &s;o inflammatory a nature, as that of writing to the other colonies, on the &s;ubject of their intended repre&s;entations again&s;t &s;ome late acts of parliament;</Q> then declares, that <Q>his maje&s;ty con|&s;iders this &s;tep as evidently tending to create unwar|rantable combinations, to excite an unju&s;tifiable oppo|&s;ition to the con&s;titutional authority of parliament;</Q> and afterwards adds, <Q>it is the king's plea&s;ure, that as &s;oon as the general court is again a&s;&s;embled, at the time pre&s;cribed by the charter, you &s;hould require of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, in his maje&s;ty's name, to re|&s;cind the re&s;olution which gave birth to the circular
<PB N="10" REF="016625_0011_0F9D702DEBBC78E0">
letter from the &s;peaker, and to declare their di&s;appro|bation of and di&s;&s;ent to that ra&s;h and ha&s;ty proceeding.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IF the new a&s;&s;embly &s;hould refu&s;e to comply with his maje&s;ty's rea&s;onable expectation, it is the king's plea|&s;ure, that you &s;hould immediately di&s;&s;olve them.</Q></P>
<P>THIS letter being laid before the hou&s;e, and the re&s;o|lution not being re&s;cinded according to order, the a&s;&s;embly was di&s;&s;olved. A letter of a &s;imilar nature was &s;ent to other governors, to procure re&s;olutions, approving the con|duct of the repre&s;entatives of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, to be re&s;cinded al&s;o; and the hou&s;es of repre&s;entatives in other colonies refu&s;ing to comply, their a&s;&s;emblies were di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>THESE mandates &s;poke a language to which the ears of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects had for &s;everal generations been &s;trangers. The nature of a&s;&s;emblies implies a power and right of deliberation; but the&s;e commands, pro&s;cribing the exerci&s;e of judgment on the propriety of the requi&s;itions made, left to the a&s;&s;emblies only the election between dictated &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and threatened puni&s;hment: a puni&s;hment too founded on no other act than &s;uch as is deemed innocent even in &s;laves&mdash;of agreeing in petitions for redre&s;s of grievances that equally affect all.</P>
<P>THE ho&s;tile and unju&s;tifiable inva&s;ion of the town of Bo&s;ton &s;oon followed the&s;e events in the &s;ame year; though that town, the province in which it is &s;ituated, and all the colonies from abhorrence of a conte&s;t with their parent &s;tate, permitted the execution even of tho&s;e &s;tatutes again&s;t which they &s;o unanimou&s;ly were complaining, re|mon&s;trating and &s;upplicating.</P>
<P>ADMINISTRATION, determined to &s;ubdue a &s;pirit of freedom which Engli&s;h mini&s;ters &s;hould have rejoiced to cheri&s;h, entered into a monopolizing combination with the Ea&s;t-India company, to &s;end to this continent va&s;t quantities of tea, an article on which a duty was laid by a &s;tatute that in a particular manner attacked the liberties of America, and which therefore the inhabitants of the&s;e colonies had re&s;olved not to import. The cargo &s;ent to
<PB N="11" REF="016625_0012_0F9D702EAAC109B0">
South-Carolina was &s;tored, and not allowed to be &s;old. Tho&s;e &s;ent to Philadelphia and New-York were not per|mitted to be landed. That &s;ent to Bo&s;ton was de&s;troyed, becau&s;e governor Hutchin&s;on would not &s;uffer it to be re|turned.</P>
<P>ON the intelligence of the&s;e tran&s;actions arriving in Great-Britain, the public &s;pirited town la&s;t mentioned was &s;ingled out for de&s;truction, and it was determined the province it belongs to &s;hould partake of its fate. In the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament therefore were pa&s;&s;ed the acts for &s;hutting up the ports of Bo&s;ton, indemnifying the mur|derers of the inhabitants of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, and chang|ing their chartered con&s;titution of government. To en|force the&s;e acts, that province is again invaded by a fleet and army.</P>
<P>TO mention the&s;e outrageous proceedings, is &s;ufficient to explain them. For though it is pretended that the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay has been particularly di&s;|re&s;pectful to Great-Britain, yet in truth the behaviour of the people in other colonies, has been an equal <Q>oppo|&s;ition to the power a&s;&s;umed by parliament.</Q> No &s;tep however has been taken again&s;t any of the re&s;t. This artful conduct conceals &s;everal de&s;igns. It is expected that the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay will be irritated into &s;ome violent action that may di&s;plea&s;e the re&s;t of the continent, or that may induce the people of Great-Britain to approve the meditated vengeance of an imprudent and exa&s;perated mini&s;try. If the unexampled pacific temper of that province &s;hall di&s;appoint this part of the plan, it is hoped the other colonies will be &s;o far intimidated as to de&s;ert their brethren, &s;uffering in a common cau&s;e, and that thus di&s;united, all may be &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>TO promote the&s;e de&s;igns, another mea&s;ure has been pur&s;ued. In the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament la&s;t mentioned, an act was pa&s;&s;ed for changing the government of Quebec, by which act the Roman catholic religion, in&s;tead of being tolerated, as &s;tipulated by the treaty of peace, is e&s;tabli&s;hed; and the people there are deprived of a right to an a&s;&s;embly, trials by jury, and the Engli&s;h laws in civil ca&s;es are
<PB N="12" REF="016625_0013_0F9D702F8CF68AE0">
aboli&s;hed, and in&s;tead thereof the French laws are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, in direct violation of his maje&s;ty's promi&s;e by his royal proclamation, under the faith of which many Engli&s;h &s;ubjects &s;ettled in that province; and the limits of that province are extended &s;o as to comprehend tho&s;e va&s;t re|gions that lie adjoining to the northerly and we&s;terly boundaries of the&s;e colonies.</P>
<P>THE authors of this arbitrary arrangement flatter them|&s;elves, that the inhabitants deprived of liberty, and art|fully provoked again&s;t tho&s;e of another religion, will be proper in&s;truments for a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch as differ from them in the modes of government and faith.</P>
<P>FROM the detail of facts herein before recited, as well as from authentic intelligence received, it is clear beyond a doubt, that a re&s;olution is formed and now carrying into execution, to extingui&s;h the freedom of the&s;e colonies by &s;ubjecting them to a de&s;potic government.</P>
<P>FOR the redre&s;s of the&s;e grievances, the Congre&s;s of America, in&s;tead of flying to arms, which, however ju&s;ti|fiable, would not perhaps have been wi&s;e, and which cer|tainly ought as much as po&s;&s;ible to be avoided, pre&s;ented a petition to the king, which after taking notice of the &s;everal executive and legi&s;lative acts before mentioned, proceeds thus.&mdash;"To a &s;overeign who glories in the name of Briton, the bare recital of the&s;e acts mu&s;t, we pre&s;ume, ju&s;tify the loyal &s;ubjects who fly to the foot of his throne, and implore his clemency for protection again&s;t them.</P>
<P>FROM this de&s;tructive &s;y&s;tem of colony admini&s;tration, adopted &s;ince the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t war, have flowed tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, dangers, fears and jealou&s;ies that over|whelm your maje&s;ty's dutiful coloni&s;ts with affliction: and we defy our mo&s;t &s;ubtle and inveterate enemies to trace the unhappy differences between Great-Britain and the&s;e colonies, from an earlier period, or from other cau&s;es, than we have a&s;&s;igned. Had they proceeded on our own part from a re&s;tle&s;s levity of temper, unju&s;t impul&s;es of ambition, or artful &s;ugge&s;tions of &s;editious per&s;ons, we

&s;hould merit the opprobrious terms frequently be&s;towed upon us by tho&s;e we revere. But &s;o far from promoting innovations, we have only oppo&s;ed them; and can be charged with no offence unle&s;s it be one to receive injuries and be &s;en&s;ible of them.</P>
<P>HAD our creator been plea&s;ed to give us exi&s;tence in a land of &s;lavery, the &s;en&s;e of our condition might have been mitigated by ignorance and habit. But, thanks be to his adorable goodne&s;s, we were born the heirs of free|dom, and ever enjoyed our right under the au&s;pices of your royal ance&s;tors, who&s;e family was &s;eated on the Bri|ti&s;h throne to re&s;cue and &s;ecure a pious and gallant nation from the de&s;poti&s;m of a &s;uper&s;titious and inexorable tyrant. Your maje&s;ty, we are confident, ju&s;tly rejoices that your title to the crown is thus founded on the title of your people to liberty; and therefore, we doubt not but your royal wi&s;dom mu&s;t approve the &s;en&s;ibility that teaches your &s;ubjects anxiou&s;ly to guard the ble&s;&s;ing they received from Divine Providence, and thereby to prove the performance of that compact which elevated the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick to the imperial dignity it now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>THE apprehen&s;ion of being degraded into a &s;tate of &s;ervitude from the pre-eminent rank of Engli&s;h freemen, while our minds retain the &s;tronge&s;t love of liberty and clearly fore&s;ee the mi&s;eries preparing for us and our po|&s;terity, excites emotions in our brea&s;ts, which though we cannot de&s;cribe, we &s;hould not wi&s;h to conceal. Feeling as men, and thinking as &s;ubjects in the manner we do, &s;ilence would be di&s;loyalty. By giving this faithful in|formation, we do all in our power to promote the great objects of your royal cares, the tranquillity of your go|vernment, and the welfare of your people.</P>
<P>DUTY to your maje&s;ty, and regard for the pre&s;ervation of our&s;elves and our po&s;terity, the primary obligations of nature and &s;ociety, command us to entreat your royal at|tention; and as your maje&s;ty enjoys the &s;ignal di&s;tinction of reigning over freemen, we apprehend the language of freemen cannot be di&s;plea&s;ing.

<P>THESE &s;entiments are extorted from hearts that much more willingly would bleed in your maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.

Whoever &s;hall read the hi&s;tory of the&s;e tran&s;|actions in a future age, will perhaps be a&s;toni&s;hed that after the de&s;ign of our enemies was thus clearly manife&s;ted, no other mea&s;ures were taken to counteract them. To &s;uppo&s;e that they would give up the plan &s;o regularly formed and &s;o deliberately undertaken, without the mo&s;t cogent nece&s;&s;ity, was certainly ab&s;urd. War therefore &s;hould have been con&s;idered as inevitable, and every pro|vi&s;ion made for it by large importations of cloathing and military &s;tores, as well as by negotiations with the rivals of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>THESE things however were not only neglected, but the direct contrary road was pur&s;ued; &s;o that the war really found us in a &s;ituation far more naked and unpro|vided than was natural to us. In an&s;wer to this however it is to be ob&s;erved again, that mankind rea&s;on from their feelings. That we were really attached to Great-Britain, and &s;ought only to be united to her, if it were po&s;&s;ible to be &s;o, without the total pro&s;tration of all our rights. This attachment in fact blinded us to our intere&s;ts &s;o effectually, that a preparation for war, or a threat of in|dependence, would have created the mo&s;t violent ferment. Congre&s;s (whatever may have been their private &s;enti|ments) were then, as at pre&s;ent, under a nece&s;&s;ity of con|forming to the popular opinion. Great reliance was placed upon the clemency of the prince, the ju&s;tice of the people, and the commercial intere&s;ts of the empire. Be|&s;ides all this, war with Great-Britain was a mo&s;t &s;erious object. It would have been &s;uch to any power on earth. Succe&s;s was at lea&s;t highly doubtful. The con&s;equence of victory on their part mu&s;t have been on ours a total &s;ubjection. However clear might be the right of re|&s;i&s;tance in ca&s;es of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, it &s;eemed to be highly proper, that this nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould clearly appear before the previous &s;teps to re&s;i&s;tance were taken. On the whole, it was perhaps hardly ju&s;tifiable to appeal to arms while the remote&s;t probability remained of obtaining without them the great object of peace, liberty and &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="016625_0020_0F9D70356A0CA9E8">IT was in conformity to the&s;e &s;entiments, that on the 11th of October, 1774, the Congre&s;s wrote a letter to general Gage, intreating him to forbear mea&s;ures tending to irritate the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, and at the &s;ame time, "re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, that they be advi&s;ed &s;till to conduct them&s;elves peaceably towards his excel|lency general Gage, and his maje&s;ty's troops now &s;tationed in the town of Bo&s;ton, as far as can po&s;&s;ibly be con&s;i&s;tent with their immediate &s;afety, and the &s;ecurity of the town; avoiding and di&s;countenancing every violation of his ma|je&s;ty's property, or any in&s;ult to his troops; and that they peaceably and firmly per&s;evere in the line they are now conducting them&s;elves on the defen&s;ive."</P>
<P>THIS Congre&s;s having given it as their opinion, that another &s;hould meet on the tenth of May then next, di&s;|&s;olved it&s;elf on the 26th of October.</P>
<P>IT appears that while they were thus &s;olicitous for peace, our enemies had taken their determinations unalterably; for though the letter of lord Dartmouth to general Gage does not appear, the an&s;wer of the general of the 15th December, 1774, contains the fulle&s;t conviction. He &s;ays,&mdash;"Your lord&s;hip's idea of di&s;arming certain pro|vinces would doubtle&s;s be con&s;i&s;tent with prudence and &s;afety; but it neither is, nor has been practicable, without having recour&s;e to force, and being ma&s;ters of the country."</P>
<P>THEIR con&s;equent conduct appears fully con&s;onant with this general plan; for the petition to the king received no other notice than to be thrown on the table of parliament among the ma&s;s of American papers, by which his intention to take part with our fellow &s;ubjects again&s;t us was fully declared. His mini&s;ters avowed the determination to compel us to obey the acts they had pa&s;&s;ed; and a very con&s;iderable force was &s;ent out for that purpo&s;e. In the month of February, a re&s;olution was agreed to on a mo|tion of one of the mini&s;ters, which was at that time called a conciliatory motion; and which (allowing us to po&s;&s;e&s;s common &s;en&s;e and common &s;pirit) was directly the rever&s;e.

on the American papers, motion made, and que|&s;tion propo&s;ed,</P>
<P>"THAT it is the opinion of this committee, that when the general council and a&s;&s;embly, or general court of any of his maje&s;ty's provinces or colonies in <HI>America,</HI> &s;hall propo&s;e to make provi&s;ion according to the condition, circum&s;tance, or &s;ituation of &s;uch province or colony, for contributing their proportion to the common defence (&s;uch proportion to be rai&s;ed under the authority of the general court, or general a&s;&s;embly of &s;uch province or colony, and di&s;po&s;able by parliament) and &s;hall engage to make provi&s;ion al&s;o for the &s;upport of the civil government, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in &s;uch province or colony, it will be proper, if &s;uch propo&s;al &s;hall be approved by his maje&s;ty and the two hou&s;es of parliament, and for &s;o long as &s;uch provi&s;ion &s;hall be made accordingly, to forbear in re&s;pect of &s;uch province or colony, to lay any duty, tax, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, except only &s;uch duties as it may be expe|dient to continue to levy or impo&s;e for the regulation of commerce; the net produce of the duties la&s;t mentioned to be carried to the account of &s;uch province or colony re&s;pectively."</P>
<P>THE Congre&s;s took the &s;aid re&s;olution into con&s;i|deration, and are thereupon of opinion,</P>
<P>THAT the colonies of America are entitled to the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive privilege of giving and granting their own money: that this involves a right of deliberating whether they will make any gift, for what purpo&s;es it &s;hall be made, and what &s;hall be its amount; and that it is a high breach of this privilege for any body of men, extraneous to their con&s;titutions, to pre&s;cribe the purpo&s;es for which money &s;hall be levied on them, to take to them&s;elves the authority of judging of their conditions, circum&s;tances and &s;ituations, and of determining the amount of the contribution to be levied.</P>
<P>THAT as the colonies po&s;&s;e&s;s a right of appropriating their gifts, &s;o are they intitled at all times to enquire into their application, to &s;ee that they be not wa&s;ted among
<PB N="21" REF="016625_0022_0F9D7036EBF762E8">
the venal and corrupt, for the purpo&s;e of undermining the civil rights of the givers, nor yet be diverted to the &s;upport of &s;tanding armies, incon&s;i&s;tent with their freedom and &s;ubver&s;ive of their quiet. To propo&s;e therefore, as this re&s;olution does, that the monies given by the colonies &s;hall be &s;ubject to the di&s;po&s;al of parliament alone, is to propo&s;e that they &s;hall relinqui&s;h this right of enquiry, and put it in the power of others to render their gifts ruinous, in proportion as they are liberal.</P>
<P>THAT this privilege of giving or of with-holding our monies, is an important barrier again&s;t the undue exertion of prerogative, which if left altogether without controul, may be exerci&s;ed to our great oppre&s;&s;ion; and all hi&s;tory &s;hews how efficacious is its interce&s;&s;ion for redre&s;s of griev|ances and re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of rights, and how improvident it would be to part with &s;o powerful a mediator.</P>
<P>WE are of opinion that the propo&s;ition contained in this re&s;olution is unrea&s;onable and in&s;idious; unrea&s;onable, becau&s;e if we declare we accede to it, we declare without re&s;ervation we will purcha&s;e the favour of parliament, not knowing at the &s;ame time at what price they will plea&s;e to e&s;timate their favour; it is in&s;idious, becau&s;e individual colonies having bid and bidden again, till they find the avidity of the &s;eller too great for all their powers to &s;atisfy, are then to return into oppo&s;ition, divided from their &s;i&s;ter colonies, whom the mini&s;ter will have previou&s;ly detached by a grant of ea&s;ier terms, or by an artful procra&s;tination of a definitive an&s;wer.</P>
<P>THAT the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the exerci&s;e of their pretended power of taxation being expre&s;sly made commen&s;urate with the continuance of our gifts, the&s;e mu&s;t be perpetual to make that &s;o.

On the contrary, the par|liament it&s;elf wi&s;ely attentive to this ob&s;ervation, are in the e&s;tabli&s;hed practice of granting their &s;upplies from year to year only.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="016625_0023_0F9D7037AA67D9A8">DESIROUS and determined as we are to con&s;ider in the mo&s;t di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate view, every &s;eeming advance towards a reconciliation made by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament, let our bre|thren of <HI>Britain</HI> reflect what would have been the &s;acrifice to men of free &s;pirits, had even fair terms been profered, as the&s;e in&s;iduous propo&s;als were with circum&s;tances of in&s;ult and defiance. A propo&s;ition to give our money, accompanied with large fleets and armies, &s;eems addre&s;&s;ed to our fears rather than to our freedom. With what pa|tience would <HI>Britons</HI> have received articles of treaty from any power on earth, when borne on the point of a bayonet by military plenipotentaries?</P>
<P>WE think the attempt unnece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e upon us by force or by threats our proportional contributions to the common defence, when all know, and them&s;elves acknow|lege, we have fully contributed whenever called upon to do &s;o in the character of freemen.</P>
<P>WE are of opinion it is not ju&s;t that the colonies &s;hould be required to oblige them&s;elves to other contributions, while <HI>Great-Britain</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a monopoly of their trade. This of it&s;elf lays them under heavy contribution. To demand therefore additional aids in the form of a tax, is to demand the double of their equal proportion; if we are to contribute equally with the other parts of the em|pire, let us equally with them enjoy free commerce with the whole world. But while the re&s;trictions on our trade &s;hut to us the re&s;ources of wealth, is it ju&s;t we &s;hould bear all other burthens equally with tho&s;e to whom every re&s;ource is open?</P>
<P>WE conceive that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament has no right to intermeddle with our provi&s;ions for the &s;upport of civil government, or admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. The provi&s;ions we have made are &s;uch as plea&s;e our&s;elves, and are agreeable to our own circum&s;tances: they an&s;wer the &s;ub&s;tantial pur|po&s;es of government and of ju&s;tice, and other purpo&s;es than the&s;e &s;hould not be an&s;wered. We do not mean that our people &s;hall be burthened with oppre&s;&s;ive taxes, to provide fine cures for the idle or the wicked, under colour of providing for a civil li&s;t. While parliament pur&s;ue
<PB N="23" REF="016625_0024_0F9D703869CA49B8">
their plan of civil government within their own juri&s;|diction, we al&s;o hope to pur&s;ue ours without mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>WE are of opinion, the propo&s;ition is altogether un&s;a|tisfactory, becau&s;e it imports only a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the mode, not a renunciation of the pretended right to tax us; becau&s;e too it does not propo&s;e to repeal the &s;everal acts of parliament pa&s;&s;ed for the purpo&s;es of re&s;training the trade, and altering the form of government of one of our colonies; extending the boundaries and changing the government of Quebec; enlarging the juri&s;diction of the courts of admiralty and vice admiralty; taking from us the rights of trial by a jury of the vicinage, in ca&s;es affecting both life and property; tran&s;porting us into other countries to be tried for criminal offences; exempting by mock-trial the murderers of coloni&s;ts from puni&s;hment; and quartering &s;oldiers on us in times of profound peace. Nor do they renounce the power of &s;u&s;pending our own legi&s;latures, and legi&s;lating for us them&s;elves in all ca&s;es what&s;oever. On the contrary, to &s;hew they mean no di&s;|continuance of injury, they pa&s;s acts at the very time of holding out this propo&s;ition, for re&s;training the commerce and fi&s;heries of the provinces of <HI>New-England,</HI> and for interdicting the trade of other colonies with all foreign nations, and with each other. This proves unequivo|cally they mean not to relinqui&s;h the exerci&s;e of indi&s;|criminate legi&s;lation over us.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, this propo&s;ition &s;eems to have been held up to the world, to deceive it into a belief that there was nothing in di&s;pute between us but the mode of levying taxes; and that the parliament having now been &s;o good as to give up this, the colonies are unrea&s;onable if not perfectly &s;atisfied: whereas in truth, our adver&s;aries &s;till claim a right of demanding <HI>ad libitum,</HI> and of taxing us them&s;elves to the full amount of their demand, if we do not comply with it. This leaves us without any thing we can call property. But what is of more importance, and what in this propo&s;al they keep out of &s;ight, as if no &s;uch point was now in conte&s;t between us, they claim a right to alter our charters and e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, and leave us without any &s;ecurity for our lives or liberties. The pro|po&s;ition

<P>WHAT mu&s;t always appear a&s;toni&s;hing is, that the Bri|ti&s;h mini&s;try could ever have &s;uppo&s;ed that the propo&s;i|tion could be &s;atisfactory, or rather that they could har|bour a doubt, that it would be rejected with contempt; yet le&s;t this &s;hould not be the ca&s;e, no opportunity was ever given to try the efficacy of it: for on the nineteenth of April, the fatal blow was &s;truck at Lexington, which &s;evered the empire. The rea&s;ons are apparent. Their force and our weakne&s;s gave them unbounded confidence. They &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves certain of victory. They &s;up|po&s;ed us equally certain of defeat. Palpable therefore as was the artifice of the conciliatory motion, it was not impo&s;&s;ible Congre&s;s at their meeting in May, might lay hold of it as a ground of treaty. If they &s;hould, the good &s;en&s;e and the ju&s;tice of our fellow &s;ubjects might have interpo&s;ed to prevent our de&s;truction. No time therefore was to be lo&s;t in putting that to the i&s;&s;ue of arms, which would not bear the te&s;t of argument. It was hoped that the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e would be hidden by our inability to &s;upport it; and their u&s;urpations di&s;gui&s;ed and adorned by the &s;plendors of &s;ucce&s;s. Here then commences a new aera.</P>
<P>THE unprovoked ho&s;tilities at Lexington gave fire as might have been expected to the inflamable di&s;po&s;itions excited throughout America. The call to arms was general, and the popular rage amounted almo&s;t to frenzy. But the emotion &s;o &s;uddenly and forcibly excited, daily became more moderate. The joys of victory by degrees &s;ilenced the mourning dirge. Wi&s;e and good men in|tere&s;ted them&s;elves to a&s;&s;uage a tempe&s;t, the bounds and effects of who&s;e violence neither wi&s;dom could fore&s;ee nor virtue confine. The partizans of Great-Britain (for &s;trange as it may &s;eem, &s;uch there were) mingled with their fellow citizens and indu&s;triou&s;ly gave a favourable turn to

this atrocious act. It was not perhaps impo&s;&s;ible even then to have &s;tayed the de&s;troying &s;word. But as the neighbouring people had collected them&s;elves to prevent a repetition of the like injuries, upon the arrival of the generals Howe and Burgoyne, it was determined not to &s;uffer that &s;pirit to evaporate which was deemed nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;es of domination. At Bunker's Hill a &s;econd and more bloody &s;acrifice was made to the god of war. Le&s;t the intended acts of violence &s;hould be attri|buted to accident, or to any other of the many cau&s;es which might be, and which by the friends of our enemies actually were a&s;&s;igned, and in order to intimidate the great council of America into a mean and abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, a per&s;on was &s;ent from the mini&s;try to a&s;&s;ure them of the truth of the following paper:</P>
<P>"THAT it is earne&s;tly hoped by all the real friends of the Americans, that the terms expre&s;&s;ed in the re&s;olution of the 20th of February la&s;t, will be accepted by all the colonies, who have the lea&s;t affection for their king and country, or a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>"THAT the&s;e terms are honourable for Great-Britain and &s;afe for the colonies.</P>
<P>"THAT if the colonies are not blinded by faction, the&s;e terms will remove every grievance relative to taxation, and be the ba&s;is of a compact between the colonies and the mother country.</P>
<P>"THAT the people in America ought, on every con&s;i|deration, to be &s;atisfied with them.</P>
<P>"THAT no further relaxation can be admitted.</P>
<P>"THE temper and &s;pirit of the nation are &s;o much again&s;t conce&s;&s;ions, that if it were the intention of admi|ni&s;tration, they could not carry the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>"BUT admini&s;tration have no &s;uch intention, as they are fully and firmly per&s;uaded, that further conce&s;&s;ions would be injurious to the colonies as well as to Great-Britain.</P>
<P>"THAT there is not the lea&s;t probability of a change of admini&s;tration.</P>

the whole force of the kingdom, if it be found nece&s;&s;ary, to reduce the rebellious and refractory provinces and co|lonies.</P>
<P>"THERE is &s;o great a &s;pirit in the nation again&s;t the Congre&s;s, that the people will bear the temporary di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a &s;toppage of the American trade.</P>
<P>"THEY may depend on this to be true."</P>
<P>THE conduct of the Congre&s;s at this time wore very much the appearance of pu&s;illanimity, for after the Lex|ington battle, while it was expected that the troops from England would arrive at New-York, the city and county of New-York, applied through their delegates for advice how to conduct them&s;elves;&mdash;upon which it was</P>
<P>"RESOLVED, That it be recommended, for the pre|&s;ent, to the inhabitants of New-York, that if the troops which are expected &s;hould arrive, the &s;aid colony act on the defen&s;ive, &s;o long as may be con&s;i&s;tent with their &s;afety and &s;ecurity: that the troops be permitted to remain in the barracks, &s;o long as they behave peaceably and quietly; but that they be not &s;uffered to erect fortifications, or take any &s;teps for cutting off the communication between the town and country; and that if they commit ho&s;tilities, or invade private property, the inhabitants &s;hould defend them&s;elves and their property, and repel force by force: that the warlike &s;tores be removed from the town: that places of retreat, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, be provided for the women and children of New-York; and that a &s;ufficient number of men be embodied, and kept in con&s;tant readine&s;s for protecting the inhabitants from in&s;ult and injury."</P>
<P>BUT it mu&s;t be remembered, that affairs were then in a very critical &s;ituation. Hud&s;on's river, which hath been con&s;idered as the key of America, was in the power of the enemy, if they cho&s;e to take it. The people of that colony were much divided in &s;entiment; the mini&s;try had many partizans among them, excited by the hope of ho|nours and rewards; many from a fear of impending danger; all were apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences of a war which rea&s;on and former experience &s;erved to &s;hew mu&s;t rage in the bowels of that country. On the whole,
<PB N="27" REF="016625_0028_0F9D703CEC1078C8">
therefore, it was probable that the efforts of the enemy would be turned that way, and that violent coun&s;els might produce a &s;erious defection. The conduct of the Con|gre&s;s may then be con&s;idered as wi&s;e and firm, for im|mediately after, they</P>
<P>"RESOLVED unanimou&s;ly, That his maje&s;ty's mo&s;t faithful &s;ubjects in the&s;e colonies are reduced to a danger|ous and critical &s;ituation, by the attempts of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try to carry into execution, by force of arms, &s;everal uncon&s;titutional and oppre&s;&s;ive acts of the Briti&s;h parlia|ment for laying taxes in America; to enforce the col|lection of tho&s;e taxes, and for altering and changing the con&s;titution and internal police of &s;ome of the&s;e colonies, in violation of the natural and civil rights of the coloni&s;ts.</P>

<P>NO country perhaps in the world was ever in a more delicate &s;ituation than America at this period. Informed and di&s;cerning minds &s;aw the mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;ervitude on the one hand; and on the other, that they mu&s;t be &s;trip|ped of property, and &s;uffer an ignominious death, without &s;uch a coincidence of circum&s;tances as nothing but Pro|vidence could accompli&s;h. They &s;aw one of the mo&s;t powerful nations upon earth, who&s;e fleets covered the ocean&mdash;who&s;e flag had waved in triumph thro' the four quarters of the globe, ready to dart all her thunders again&s;t them; at the &s;ame time, America was without &s;hips, without arms, without clothes, without money, without officers, without di&s;cipline, without a &s;ingle fortification, a very con&s;iderable faction ready to join her enemies, expo&s;ed thro' an immen&s;e frontier to the irruptions of &s;avage tribes, who&s;e lu&s;t of blood was daily &s;timulated by all the arts which an unfeeling inhuman policy could dictate; while a herd of &s;laves were urged by the in&s;idious offer of freedom, to plunge an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in's dagger in the bo|&s;om of dome&s;tic &s;ecurity. In this cri&s;is, however, it was determined to ri&s;k every thing, rather than tamely &s;ubmit to the yoke; but, at the &s;ame time, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to avoid as much as po&s;&s;ible giving an alarm to the

people, by the mortifying di&s;play of their comparative weakne&s;s. On the 6th of July, 1775, the Congre&s;s pu|bli&s;hed the following declaration:</P>
<P>"IF it was po&s;&s;ible for men, who exerci&s;e their rea&s;on, to believe, that the Divine Author of our exi&s;tence in|tended a part of the human race to hold an ab&s;olute pro|perty in, and an unbounded power over others, marked out by his infinite goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom, as the objects of a legal domination never rightfully re&s;i&s;tible, however &s;evere and oppre&s;&s;ive, the inhabitants of the&s;e colonies might at lea&s;t require from the parliament of Great-Britain &s;ome evidence, that this dreadful authority over them has been granted to that body. But a reverence for our great Creator, principles of humanity, and the dictates of com|mon &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t convince all tho&s;e who reflect upon the &s;ubject, that government was in&s;tituted to promote the welfare of mankind, and ought to be admini&s;tered for the attainment of that end. The legi&s;lature of Great-Britain, however, &s;timulated by an inordinate pa&s;&s;ion for a power not only unju&s;tifiable, but which they know to be pecu|liarly reprobated by the very con&s;titution of that kingdom, and de&s;perate of &s;ucce&s;s in any mode of conte&s;t, where regard &s;hould be had to truth, law, or right, have at length, de&s;erting tho&s;e, attempted to effect their cruel and impolitic purpo&s;e of en&s;laving the&s;e colonies by violence, and have thereby rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for us to clo&s;e with their la&s;t appeal from rea&s;on to arms. Yet, however blinded that a&s;&s;embly may be, by their intemperate rage for unlimited domination, &s;o to &s;light ju&s;tice and the opi|nion of mankind, we e&s;teem our&s;elves bound by obliga|tions of re&s;pect to the re&s;t of the world, to make known the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e.</P>

At the expence of their blood, at the hazard of their fortunes, without the lea&s;t charge to the country from which they removed, by uncea&s;ing labour and an unconquerable &s;pirit, they effected &s;ettlements in the di&s;tant and inho&s;pitable wilds of America, then filled with numerous and warlike nations of barbarians.

legi&s;latures, were formed under charters from the crown, and an harmonious intercour&s;e was e&s;tabli&s;hed be|tween the colonies and the kingdom from which they derived their origin. The mutual benefits of this union became in a &s;hort time &s;o extraordinary, as to excite a&s;toni&s;hment. It is univer&s;ally confe&s;&s;ed, that the amazing increa&s;e of the wealth, &s;trength, and navigation of the realm, aro&s;e from this &s;ource; and the mini&s;ter, who &s;o wi&s;ely and &s;ucce&s;sfully directed the mea&s;ures of Great-Britain in the late war, publicly declared, that the&s;e co|lonies enabled her to triumph over her enemies. Towards the conclu&s;ion of that war, it plea&s;ed our &s;overeign to make a change in his coun&s;els. From that fatal mo|ment, the affairs of the Briti&s;h empire began to fall into confu&s;ion, and gradually &s;liding from the &s;ummit of glo|rious pro&s;perity, to which they had been advanced by the virtues and abilities of one man, are at length di&s;|tracted by the convul&s;ions, that now &s;hake it to its deepe&s;t foundations. The new mini&s;try finding the brave foes of Britain, though frequently defeated, yet &s;till contending, took up the unfortunate idea of granting them a ha&s;ty peace, and of then &s;ubduing her faithful friends.</P>
<P>"THESE devoted colonies were judged to be in &s;uch a &s;tate, as to pre&s;ent victories without blood&s;hed, and all the ea&s;y emoluments of &s;tatuteable plunder. The uninter|rupted tenor of their peaceable and re&s;pectful behaviour from the beginning of colonization, their dutiful, zea|lous, and u&s;eful &s;ervices during the war, though &s;o re|cently and amply acknowleged in the mo&s;t honourable manner by his maje&s;ty, by the late king, and by parlia|ment, could not &s;ave them from the meditated innovations. Parliament was influenced to adopt the pernicious project, and a&s;&s;uming a new power over them, have in the cour&s;e of eleven years given &s;uch deci&s;ive &s;pecimens of the &s;pirit and con&s;equences attending this power, as to leave no doubt concerning the effects of acquie&s;cence under it. They have undertaken to give and grant our money with|out our con&s;ent, though we have ever exerci&s;ed an ex|clu&s;ive right to di&s;po&s;e of our own property; &s;tatutes have been pa&s;&s;ed for extending the juri&s;diction of courts of admiralty and vice-admiralty beyond their ancient limits;
<PB N="31" REF="016625_0032_0F9D703FE9A32248">
for depriving us of the accu&s;tomed and ine&s;timable pri|vilege of trial by jury in ca&s;es affecting both life and property; for &s;u&s;pending the legi&s;lature of one of the co|lonies; for interdicting all commerce to the capital of another; and for altering fundamentally the form of go|vernment e&s;tabli&s;hed by charter, and &s;ecured by acts of its own legi&s;lature &s;olemnly confirmed by the crown; for ex|empting the "murderers" of coloni&s;ts from legal trial, and in effect, from puni&s;hment; for erecting in a neighbouring province, acquired by the joint arms of Great-Britain and America, a de&s;poti&s;m dangerous to our very exi&s;tence; and for quartering &s;oldiers upon the coloni&s;ts in time of profound peace. It has al&s;o been re&s;olved in parliament, that coloni&s;ts charged with committing certain offences, &s;hall be tran&s;ported to England to be tried.</P>
<P>"BUT why &s;hould we enumerate our injuries in detail? By one &s;tatute it is declared, that parliament can "of right make laws to bind us <HI>in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</HI>" What is to defend us again&s;t &s;o enormous, &s;o unlimited a power? Not a &s;ingle man of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ume it, is cho&s;en by us; or is &s;ubject to our controul or influence; but on the contrary, they are all of them exempt from the operation of &s;uch laws, and an American revenue, if not diverted from the o&s;ten&s;ible purpo&s;es for which it is rai&s;ed, would actually lighten their own burdens in proportion, as they increa&s;e ours.

The indignation of the Americans was rou&s;ed, it is true; but it was the in|dignation of a virtuous, loyal, and affectionate people. A Congre&s;s of delegates from the United Colonies was a&s;|&s;embled at Philadelphia, on the fifth day of la&s;t September. We re&s;olved again to offer an humble and dutiful petition to the king, and al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed our fellow &s;ubjects of Great-Britain.

the la&s;t peaceable admonition, that our attachment to no nation upon earth &s;hould &s;upplant our attachment to li|berty. This, we flattered our&s;elves, was the ultimate &s;tep of the controver&s;y: but &s;ub&s;equent events have &s;hewn, how vain was this hope of finding moderation in our enemies.</P>
<P>"SEVERAL threatening expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the colonies were in&s;erted in his maje&s;ty's &s;peech; our petition, tho' we were told it was a decent one, and that his maje&s;ty had been plea&s;ed to receive it graciou&s;ly, and to promi&s;e laying it before his parliament, was huddled into both hou&s;es among a bundle of American papers, and there neglected. The lords and commons in their addre&s;s, in the month of February, &s;aid, that "a rebellion at that time actually ex|i&s;ted within the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay; and that tho&s;e concerned in it, had been countenanced and encou|raged by unlawful combinations and engagements, entered into by his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in &s;everal of the other co|lonies; and therefore they be&s;ought his maje&s;ty, that he would take the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to inforce due obe|dience to the laws and authority of the &s;upreme legi&s;lature." Soon after the commercial intercour&s;e of whole colonies, with foreign countries, and with each other, was cut off by an act of parliament; by another, &s;everal of them were entirely prohibited from the fi&s;heries in the &s;eas near their coa&s;ts, on which they always depended for their &s;u&s;te|nance; and large reinforcements of &s;hips and troops were immediately &s;ent over to general Gage.</P>
<P>"FRUITLESS were all the entreaties, arguments, and eloquence of an illu&s;trious band of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed peers and commoners, who nobly and &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, to &s;tay, or even to mitigate the heedle&s;s fury with which the&s;e accumulated and unexam|pled outrages were hurried on. Equally fruitle&s;s was the interference of the city of London, of Bri&s;tol, and many other re&s;pectable towns, in our favour. Parliament adopted an in&s;idious manoeuvre calculated to divide us, to e&s;tabli&s;h a perpetual auction of taxations where colony &s;hould bid again&s;t colony, all of them uninformed what ran&s;om &s;hould redeem their lives; and thus to extort from us, at the point of the bayonet, the unknown &s;ums that &s;hould be &s;ufficient to gratify, if po&s;&s;ible to gratify, mini&s;terial ra|pacity,
<PB N="33" REF="016625_0034_0F9D70416963FE38">
with the mi&s;erable indulgence left to us of rai&s;ing, in our own mode, the pre&s;cribed tribute. What terms more rigid and humiliating could have been dictated by remor&s;ele&s;s victors to conquered enemies? In our circum|&s;tances to accept them, would be to de&s;erve them.</P>
<P>"SOON after the intelligence of the&s;e proceedings ar|rived on this continent, general Gage, who in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town of Bo&s;ton, in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, and &s;till occupied it as a garri&s;on, on the 19th day of April, &s;ent out from that place a large detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked a&s;&s;ault on the inhabitants of the &s;aid province, at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of a great number of per&s;ons, &s;ome of whom were officers and &s;oldiers of that detachment, murdered eight of the inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord, where they &s;et upon another party of the inhabitants of the &s;ame province, killing &s;everal and wounding more, until compelled to retreat by the country people &s;uddenly a&s;&s;embled to repel this cruel aggre&s;&s;ion. Ho&s;tilities, thus commenced by the Briti&s;h troops, have been &s;ince pro&s;e|cuted by them without regard to faith or reputation. The inhabitants of Bo&s;ton being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to pro|cure their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, entered into a treaty with him, it was &s;tipulated, that the &s;aid inhabitants having depo&s;ited their arms with their own magi&s;trates, &s;hould have liberty to depart, taking with them their other effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honour, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even &s;avage nations e&s;teemed &s;acred, the governor ordered the arms depo&s;ited as afore&s;aid, that they might be pre|&s;erved for their owners, to be &s;eized by a body of &s;oldiers; detained the greate&s;t part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their mo&s;t valuable effects behind.</P>
<P>"BY this perfidy wives are &s;eparated from their hu&s;|bands, children from their parents, the aged and the &s;ick from their relations and friends, who wi&s;h to attend and comfort them; and tho&s;e who have been u&s;ed to live in plenty and even elegance, are reduced to deplorable di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="016625_0035_0F9D7042299BD330">"THE general, further emulating his mini&s;terial ma&s;|ters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th day of June, after venting the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fal&s;ehoods and calumnies again&s;t the good people of the&s;e colonies, proceeds to <Q>declare them all, either by name or de&s;cription, to be rebels and traitors, to &s;uper&s;ede the cour&s;e of the com|mon law, and in&s;tead thereof to publi&s;h and order the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of the law martial.</Q> His troops have butchered our countrymen, have wantonly burnt Charles-town, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable number of hou&s;es in other places; our &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els are &s;eized; the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of provi&s;ions are intercepted, and he is exerting his utmo&s;t power to &s;pread de&s;truction and deva&s;tation around him.</P>
<P>"WE have received certain intelligence, that general Carleton, the governor of Canada, is in&s;tigating the people of that province, and the Indians, to fall upon us; and we have but too much rea&s;on to apprehend, that &s;chemes have been formed to excite dome&s;tic enemies again&s;t us. In brief, a part of the&s;e colonies now feel, and all of them are &s;ure of feeling, as far as the vengeance of admini&s;tration can inflict them, the complicated calamities of fire, &s;word, and famine. We are reduced to the alternative of chu&s;ing an unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the tyranny of irritated mini&s;ters, or re&s;i&s;tance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the co&s;t of this conte&s;t, and find nothing &s;o dreadful as voluntary &s;lavery. Honour, ju&s;tice, and hu|manity, forbid us tamely to &s;urrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ance&s;tors, and which our innocent po&s;terity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of re&s;igning &s;ucceeding generations to that wretchedne&s;s which inevitably awaits them, if we ba&s;ely entail hereditary bondage upon them.</P>

<P>"LEST this declaration &s;hould di&s;quiet the minds of our friends and fellow &s;ubjects in any part of the empire, we a&s;&s;ure them that we mean not to di&s;&s;olve that union which has &s;o long and &s;o happily &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us, and which we &s;incerely wi&s;h to &s;ee re&s;tored.

We have not rai&s;ed armies with ambitious de&s;igns of &s;eparating from Great-Britain, and e&s;tabli&s;hing independent &s;tates. We fight not for glory or for conque&s;t. We exhibit to man|kind the remarkable &s;pectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation or even &s;u&s;picion of offence. <HI>They</HI> boa&s;t of their privileges and civilization, and yet profer no milder conditions than &s;ervitude or death.</P>

the tendere&s;t, mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive language, and &s;he cannot &s;peak in vain. Tho' it was evident as the &s;un, that the king and parliament of Great-Britain had determined never to &s;heathe the &s;word, but upon the unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of America to the mo&s;t humiliating bondage; yet, in a delirium of their former attachment, the Con|gre&s;s prepared another petition to the king, and another addre&s;s to the people of England. Strange as it may &s;eem, it is neverthele&s;s true, that notwith&s;tanding all our in|tere&s;ts were clearly oppo&s;ed to the mea&s;ure, &s;till a con|nection with the people, and &s;ubjection to the &s;overeign of Great-Britain, were con&s;idered as the mo&s;t de&s;irable of human events: for it may truly be affirmed, that next to the love of liberty, loyalty to his prince, and love of his fellow &s;ubjects, were the ruling pa&s;&s;ions of an American's bo&s;om. The prophetic language contained in this peti|tion and addre&s;s is remarkable; and altho' it was treated by our enemies with the &s;ame contempt as our &s;olemn pro|fe&s;&s;ions not to &s;ubmit to their tyranny, yet now that, the heat of the cha&s;e being abated, a cool moment of re|flection pre&s;&s;es it&s;elf upon them, it is probable they will, when too late, give to both their &s;hare of credit.</P>

<P>"THE union between our mother country and the&s;e colonies, and the energy of mild and ju&s;t government, produced benefits &s;o remarkably important, and afforded &s;uch an a&s;&s;urance of their permanency and increa&s;e, that the wonder and envy of other nations were excited, while

they beheld Great-Britain ri&s;ing to a power the mo&s;t ex|traordinary the world had ever known.</P>
<P>"HER rivals, ob&s;erving that there was no probability of this happy connexion being broken by civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and apprehending its future effects, if left any longer un|di&s;turbed, re&s;olved to prevent her receiving &s;uch continual and formidable acce&s;&s;ions of wealth and &s;trength, by checking the growth of tho&s;e &s;ettlements from which they were to be derived.</P>
<P>"IN the pro&s;ecution of this attempt, events &s;o unfa|vourable to the de&s;ign took place, that every friend to the intere&s;t of Great-Britain and the&s;e colonies, entertained plea&s;ing and rea&s;onable expectations of &s;eeing an additional force and exertion immediately given to the operations of the union hitherto experienced, by an enlargement of the dominions of the crown, and the removal of ancient and warlike enemies to a greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>"AT the conclu&s;ion therefore of the late war, the mo&s;t glorious and advantageous that ever had been carried on by Briti&s;h arms, your loyal coloni&s;ts having contributed to its &s;ucce&s;s, by &s;uch repeated and &s;trenuous exertions, as frequently procured them the di&s;tingui&s;hed approbation of your maje&s;ty, of the late king, and of parliament, doubted not but that they &s;hould be permitted, with the re&s;t of the empire, to &s;hare in the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, and the emolu|ments of victory and conque&s;t.</P>
<P>"WHILE the&s;e recent and honourable acknowledge|ments of their merits remained on record in the journals and acts of that augu&s;t legi&s;lature, the parliament, un|defaced by the imputation or even the &s;u&s;picion of any offence, they were alarmed by a new &s;y&s;tem of &s;tatutes and regulations adopted for the admini&s;tration of the co|lonies, that filled their minds with the mo&s;t painful fears and jealou&s;ies; and, to their inexpre&s;&s;ible a&s;toni&s;hment, perceived the danger of a foreign quarrel quickly &s;ucceeded by dome&s;tic danger, in their judgment of a more dreadful kind.</P>
<P>"NOR were the&s;e anxieties alleviated by any tendency in this &s;y&s;tem to promote the welfare of their mother country. For though its effects were more immediately felt by them, yet its influence appeared to be injurious to the commerce and pro&s;perity of Great-Britain.</P>

<P>"YOUR maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters, per&s;evering in their mea|&s;ures, and proceeding to open ho&s;tilities for enforcing them, have compelled us to arm in our own defence, and have engaged us in a controver&s;y &s;o peculiarly abhorrent to the affections of your &s;till faithful coloni&s;ts, that when we con&s;ider whom we mu&s;t oppo&s;e in this conte&s;t, and if it continues, what may be the con&s;equences, our own particular misfortunes are accounted by us only as parts of our di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>"Friends, Countrymen, and Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"BY the&s;e, and by every other appellation that may de&s;ignate the ties, which bind <HI>us</HI> to each other, we entreat your &s;erious attention to this our &s;econd attempt to prevent their di&s;&s;olution. Remembrance of former friend&s;hips, pride in the glorious atchievements of our common an|ce&s;tors, and affection for the heirs of their virtues, have hitherto pre&s;erved our mutual connection; but when that friend&s;hip is violated by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t injuries; when the pride of ance&s;try becomes our reproach, and we are no other|wi&s;e allied than as tyrants and &s;laves; when reduced to the melancholy alternative of renouncing your favour or our freedom; can we he&s;itate about the choice? Let the &s;pirit of Britons determine.</P>
<P>"IN a former addre&s;s we a&s;&s;erted our rights, and &s;tated the injuries we had then received. We hoped, that the mention of our wrongs would have rou&s;ed that hone&s;t
<PB N="41" REF="016625_0042_0F9D70482A0AA648">
indignation which has &s;lept too long for your honour, or the welfare of the empire. But we have not been per|mitted to entertain this plea&s;ing expectation. Every day brought an accumulation of injuries, and the invention of the mini&s;try has been con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed, in adding to the calamities of your American brethren.</P>
<P>"AFTER the mo&s;t valuable right of legi&s;lation was in|fringed; when the powers a&s;&s;umed by your parliament, in which we are not repre&s;ented, and from our local and other circum&s;tances cannot properly be repre&s;ented, ren|dered our property precarious; after being denied that mode of trial, to which we have long been indebted for the &s;afety of our per&s;ons, and the pre&s;ervation of our liberties; after being in many in&s;tances dive&s;ted of tho&s;e laws, which were tran&s;mitted to us by our common an|ce&s;tors, and objected to an arbitrary code, compiled under the au&s;pices of Roman tyrants; after tho&s;e char|ters, which encouraged our predece&s;&s;ors to brave death and danger in every &s;hape, on unknown &s;eas, in de&s;erts unexplored, amid&s;t barbarous and inho&s;pitable nations, were annulled; when, without the form of trial, without a public accu&s;ation, whole colonies were condemned, their trade de&s;troyed, their inhabitants impoveri&s;hed; when &s;oldiers were encouraged to embrue their hands in the blood of Americans, by offers of impunity; when new modes of trial were in&s;tituted for the ruin of the accu&s;ed, where the charge carried with it the horrors of conviction; when a de&s;potic government was e&s;tabli&s;hed in a neigh|bouring province, and its limits extended to every of our frontiers; we little imagined that any thing could be added to this black catalogue of unprovoked injuries: but we have unhappily been deceived, and the late mea&s;ures of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try fully convince us, that their object is the reduction of the&s;e colonies to &s;lavery and ruin.</P>
<P>"TO confirm this a&s;&s;ertion, let us recall your at|tention to the affairs of America, &s;ince our la&s;t addre&s;s.

<P>"ANOTHER act of your legi&s;lature &s;huts our ports, and prohibits our trade with any but tho&s;e &s;tates from whom the great law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation renders it ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary we &s;hould at pre&s;ent with-hold our commerce. But this act (whatever may have been its de&s;ign) we con&s;ider rather as injurious to your opulence than our intere&s;t. All our commerce terminates with you; and the wealth we procure from other nations, is &s;oon ex|changed for your &s;uperfluities. Our remittances mu&s;t then cea&s;e with our trade; and our refinements with our affluence. We tru&s;t, however, that laws which deprive us of every ble&s;&s;ing but a &s;oil that teems with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and that liberty which renders the enjoyment of them &s;ecure, will not relax our vigour in their defence.</P>
<P>"WE might here ob&s;erve on the cruelty and incon|&s;i&s;tency of tho&s;e, who, while they publicly brand us with reproachful and unworthy epithets, endeavour to deprive us of the means of defence, by their interpo&s;ition with foreign powers, and to deliver us to the lawle&s;s ravages of a mercile&s;s &s;oldiery. But happily we are not without re&s;ources; and though the timid and humiliating appli|cations of a Briti&s;h mini&s;try &s;hould prevail with foreign nations, yet indu&s;try, prompted by nece&s;&s;ity, will not leave us without the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies.</P>
<P>"WE could wi&s;h to go no further, and, not to wound the ear of humanity, leave untold tho&s;e rigorous acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, which are daily exerci&s;ed in the town of Bo&s;ton, did we not hope, that by di&s;claiming their deeds and puni&s;hing the perpetrators, you would &s;hortly vin|dicate the honour of the Briti&s;h name and re-e&s;tabli&s;h the violated laws of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>"THAT once populous, flouri&s;hing, and commercial town is now garri&s;oned by an army &s;ent not to protect, but to en&s;lave its inhabitants. The civil government is overturned, and a military de&s;poti&s;m erected upon its
<PB N="43" REF="016625_0044_0F9D7049ABD73888">
ruins. Without law, without right, powers are a&s;&s;umed unknown to the con&s;titution. Private property is un|ju&s;tly invaded. The inhabitants, daily &s;ubjected to the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;oldiery, are forbid to remove in defiance of their natural rights, in violation of the mo&s;t &s;olemn compacts. Or if, after long and weari&s;ome &s;olici|tation, a pa&s;s is procured, their effects are detained, and even tho&s;e who are mo&s;t favoured, have no alternative but poverty or &s;lavery. The di&s;tre&s;s of many thou&s;and people, wantonly deprived of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, is a &s;ubject, on which we would not wi&s;h to enlarge.</P>
<P>"YET we cannot but ob&s;erve, that a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> fleet (un|ju&s;tified even by acts of your legi&s;lature) are daily employed in ruining our commerce, &s;eizing our &s;hips, and depriving whole communities of their daily bread. Nor will a regard for your honour permit us to be &s;ilent, while <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> troops &s;ully your glory, by actions, which the mo&s;t inveterate enmity will not palliate among civilized na|tions, the wanton and unnece&s;&s;ary de&s;truction of Charles-town, a large, ancient, and once populous town, ju&s;t before de&s;erted by its inhabitants, who had fled to avoid the fury of your &s;oldiery.</P>
<P>"IF you &s;till retain tho&s;e &s;entiments of compa&s;&s;ion, by which <HI>Britons</HI> have ever been di&s;tingui&s;hed; if the humanity, which tempered the valour of our common ance&s;tors, has not degenerated into cruelty, you will la|ment the mi&s;eries of their de&s;cendents.</P>
<P>"TO what are we to attribute this treatment? If to any &s;ecret principle of the con&s;titution, let it be men|tioned; let us learn, that the government we have long revered, is not without its defects, and that while it gives freedom to a part, it nece&s;&s;arily en&s;laves the remainder of the empire. If &s;uch a principle exi&s;ts, why for ages has it cea&s;ed to operate? Why at this time is it called into action? Can no rea&s;on be a&s;&s;igned for this conduct? Or mu&s;t it be re&s;olved into the wanton exerci&s;e of arbi|trary power? And &s;hall the de&s;cendents of <HI>Britons</HI> tamely &s;ubmit to this? No, &s;irs! we never will, while we revere the memory of our gallant and virtuous ance&s;tors, we never can &s;urrender tho&s;e glorious privileges, for which they fought, bled and conquered. Admit that your fleets could de&s;troy our towns, and ravage our &s;ea-coa&s;ts; the&s;e

are incon&s;iderable objects; things of no moment to men, who&s;e bo&s;oms glow with the ardor of liberty. We can retire beyond the reach of your navy, and, without any &s;en&s;ible diminution of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, enjoy a luxury, which from that period you will want; the luxury of being free.</P>
<P>"WE know the force of your arms, and was it called forth in the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice and your country, we might dread the exertion; but will <HI>Britons</HI> fight under the ban|ners of tyranny? Will they counteract the labours, and di&s;grace the victories of their ance&s;tors? Will they forge chains for their po&s;terity? If they de&s;cend to this un|worthy ta&s;k, will their &s;words retain their edge, their arms their accu&s;tomed vigour? <HI>Britons</HI> can never become the in&s;truments of oppre&s;&s;ion, till they lo&s;e the &s;pirit of freedom, by which alone they are invincible.</P>
<P>"OUR enemies charge us with &s;edition. In what does it con&s;i&s;t? In our refu&s;al to &s;ubmit to unwarrantable acts of inju&s;tice and cruelty? If &s;o, &s;hew us a period in your hi&s;tory, in which you have not been equally &s;editious.</P>
<P>"WE are accu&s;ed of aiming at independence; but how is this accu&s;ation &s;upported? By the allegations of your mini&s;ters, not by our actions. Abu&s;ed, in&s;ulted, and contemned, what &s;teps have we pur&s;ued to obtain re|dre&s;s? We have carried our dutiful petitions to the throne. We have applied to your ju&s;tice for relief. We have re|trenched our luxury, and with-held our trade.</P>
<P>"THE advantages of our commerce were de&s;igned as a compen&s;ation for your protection: when you cea&s;ed to protect, for what were we to compen&s;ate?</P>
<P>"WHAT has been the &s;ucce&s;s of our endeavours? The clemency of our &s;overeign is unhappily diverted; our petitions are treated with indignity; our prayers an|&s;wered by in&s;ults. Our application to you remains un|noticed, and leaves us the melancholy apprehen&s;ion of your wanting either the will, or the power, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us.</P>
<P>"EVEN under the&s;e circum&s;tances, what mea&s;ures have we taken that betray a de&s;ire of independence? Have we called in the aid of tho&s;e foreign powers, who are the rivals of your grandeur? When your troops were few and defencele&s;s, did we take advantage of their di&s;tre&s;s and expel them our towns? Or have we permitted them to

fortify, to receive new aid, and to acquire additional &s;trength?</P>
<P>"LET not <HI>your</HI> enemies and <HI>ours</HI> per&s;uade you, that in this we were influenced by fear or any other unworthy motive. The lives of <HI>Britons</HI> are &s;till dear to us. They are the children of our parents, and an uninterrupted in|tercour&s;e of mutual benefits had knit the bonds of friend|&s;hip. When ho&s;tilities were commenced, when on a late occa&s;ion we were wantonly attacked by your troops, though we repelled their a&s;&s;aults and returned their blows, yet we lamented the wounds they obliged us to give; nor have we yet learned to rejoice at a victory over Engli&s;hmen.</P>
<P>"AS we wi&s;h not to colour our actions, or di&s;gui&s;e our thoughts; we &s;hall, in the &s;imple language of truth, avow the mea&s;ures we have pur&s;ued, the motives upon which we have acted, and our future de&s;igns.</P>
<P>"WHEN our late petition to the throne produced no other effect than fre&s;h injuries, and votes of your legi&s;la|ture calculated to ju&s;tify every &s;everity; when your fleets and your armies were prepared to wre&s;t from us our pro|perty, to rob us of our liberties or our lives; when the ho&s;tile attempts of general Gage evinced his de&s;igns, we levied armies for our &s;ecurity and defence. When the powers ve&s;ted in the governor of Canada, gave us rea&s;on to apprehend danger from that quarter: and we had fre|quent intimations, that a cruel and &s;avage enemy was to be let loo&s;e upon the defencele&s;s inhabitants of our fron|tiers; we took &s;uch mea&s;ures as prudence dictated, as nece&s;&s;ity will ju&s;tify. We po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed our&s;elves of Crown-Point and Ticonderoga. Yet give us leave mo&s;t &s;olemnly to a&s;&s;ure you, that we have not yet lo&s;t &s;ight of the object we have ever had in view, a reconciliation with you on con&s;titutional principles, and a re&s;toration of that friendly intercour&s;e, which, to the advantage of both, we till lately maintained.</P>
<P>"THE inhabitants of this country apply them&s;elves chiefly to agriculture and commerce. As their fa&s;hions and manners are &s;imilar to yours, your markets mu&s;t af|ford them the conveniencies and luxuries, for which they exchange the produce of their labours. The wealth of this extended continent centers with you; and our trade is &s;o regulated as to be &s;ub&s;ervient only to your intere&s;t.

You are too rea&s;onable to expect, that by taxes (in ad|dition to this) we &s;hould contribute to your expence; to believe after diverting the fountain, that the &s;treams can flow with unabated force.</P>
<P>"IT has been &s;aid, that we refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to the re&s;trictions on our commerce. From whence is this in|ference drawn? Not from our words, we having re|peatedly declared the contrary; and we again profe&s;s our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;everal acts of trade and navigation pa&s;&s;ed before the year 1763, tru&s;ting neverthele&s;s in the equity and ju&s;tice of parliament, that &s;uch of them as, upon cool and impartial con&s;ideration, &s;hall appear to have impo&s;ed unnece&s;&s;ary or grievous re&s;trictions, will, at &s;ome happier period, be repealed or altered. And we cheerfully con&s;ent to the operation of &s;uch acts of the Briti&s;h par|liament as &s;hall be re&s;trained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ecuring the com|mercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the commercial benefits of its re&s;pective members; excluding every idea of taxation internal or external, for rai&s;ing a revenue on the &s;ubjects in America without their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>"IT is alleged that we contribute nothing to the common defence. To this we an&s;wer, that the advantages which Great-Britain receives from the monopoly of our trade, far exceed our proportion of the expence nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e. But &s;hould the&s;e advantages be inade|quate thereto, let the re&s;trictions on our trade be removed, and we will cheerfully contribute &s;uch proportion when con&s;titutionally required.</P>
<P>"IT is a fundamental principle of the Briti&s;h con&s;ti|tution, that every man &s;hould have at lea&s;t a repre&s;entative &s;hare in the formation of tho&s;e laws, by which he is bound. Were it otherwi&s;e, the regulation of our in|ternal police by a Briti&s;h parliament, who are and ever will be unacquainted with our local circum&s;tances, mu&s;t be always inconvenient, and frequently oppre&s;&s;ive, working our wrong, without yielding any po&s;&s;ible advantage to you.</P>
<P>"A PLAN of accommodation (as it has been ab&s;urdly called) has been propo&s;ed by your mini&s;ters to our re|&s;pective a&s;&s;emblies. Were this propo&s;al <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> from every other objection, but that which ari&s;es from the time of

the offer, it would not be unexceptionable. Can men deliberate with the bayonet at their brea&s;t? Can they treat with freedom, while their towns are &s;acked; when daily in&s;tances of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion di&s;turb the &s;lower operations of rea&s;on?</P>
<P>"IF this propo&s;al is really &s;uch as you would offer and we accept, why was it delayed till the nation was put to u&s;ele&s;s expence, and we were reduced to our pre&s;ent me|lancholy &s;ituation? If it holds forth nothing, why was it propo&s;ed? Unle&s;s indeed to deceive you into a belief, that we were unwilling to li&s;ten to any terms of accom|modation? But what is &s;ubmitted to our con&s;ideration? We contend for the di&s;po&s;al of our property. We are told that our demand is unrea&s;onable, that our a&s;&s;emblies may indeed collect our money, but that they mu&s;t at the &s;ame time offer, not what your exigencies or ours may require, but &s;o much as &s;hall be deemed &s;ufficient to &s;a|tisfy the de&s;ires of a mini&s;ter and enable him to provide for favourites and dependents. A recurrence to your own trea&s;ury will convince you how little of the money al|ready extorted from us has been applied to the relief of your burthens. To &s;uppo&s;e that we would thus gra&s;p the &s;hadow and give up the &s;ub&s;tance, is adding in&s;ult to injuries.</P>
<P>"WE have neverthele&s;s again pre&s;ented an humble and dutiful petition to our &s;overeign; and to remove every imputation of ob&s;tinacy, have reque&s;ted his maje&s;ty to direct &s;ome mode, by which the united applications of his faithful coloni&s;ts may be improved into a happy and per|manent reconciliation. We are willing to treat on &s;uch terms as can alone render an accommodation la&s;ting, and we flatter our&s;elves that our pacific endeavours will be attended with a removal of mini&s;terial troops, and a re|peal of tho&s;e laws of the operation of which we complain, on the one part, and a di&s;banding of our army, and a di&s;&s;olution of our commercial a&s;&s;ociations, on the other.</P>
<P>"YET conclude not from this that we propo&s;e to &s;ur|render our property into the hands of your mini&s;try, or ve&s;t your parliament with a power which may terminate in our de&s;truction. The great bulwarks of our con&s;ti|tution we have de&s;ired to maintain by every temperate, by every peaceable means; but your mini&s;ters (equal foes

to Briti&s;h and American freedom) have added to their former oppre&s;&s;ions an attempt to reduce us by the &s;word to a ba&s;e and abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. On the &s;word, there|fore, we are compelled to rely for protection. Should victory declare in your favour, yet men trained to arms from their infancy, and animated by the love of liberty, will afford neither a cheap or ea&s;y conque&s;t. Of this at lea&s;t we are a&s;&s;ured, that our &s;truggle will be glorious, our &s;ucce&s;s certain; &s;ince even in death we &s;hall find that freedom which in life you forbid us to enjoy.</P>
<P>"LET us now a&s;k what advantages are to attend our reduction? The trade of a ruined and de&s;olate country is always incon&s;iderable, its revenue trifling; the expence of &s;ubjecting and retaining it in &s;ubjection certain and inevitable. What then remains but the gratification of an ill-judged pride, or the hope of rendering us &s;ub&s;er|vient to de&s;igns on your liberty.</P>
<P>"SOLDIERS who have &s;heathed their &s;words in the bowels of their American brethren, will not draw them with more reluctance again&s;t you. When too late you may lament the lo&s;s of that freedom, which we exhort you, while &s;till in your power, to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>"ON the other hand, &s;hould you prove un&s;ucce&s;sful; &s;hould that connexion, which we mo&s;t ardently wi&s;h to maintain, be di&s;&s;olved; &s;hould your mini&s;ters exhau&s;t your trea&s;ures and wa&s;te the blood of your countrymen in vain attempts on our liberty; do they not deliver you, weak and defencele&s;s, to your natural enemies.</P>
<P>"SINCE then your liberty mu&s;t be the price of your victories; your ruin, of your defeat:&mdash;what blind fa|tality can urge you to a pur&s;uit de&s;tructive of all that Britons hold dear?</P>

<P>THE conduct ob&s;erved towards the Indian nations was in perfect con&s;i&s;tence with that di&s;po&s;ition for peace &s;o openly declared, and &s;o fully manife&s;ted.

<P>IT was not until the 25th of November, 1775, that the Congre&s;s determined to retort upon our enemies the practice of taking property on the high &s;eas. They con|&s;idered us as rebels, they had no laws in exi&s;tence whereby our property was forfeited. Unle&s;s we were con&s;idered as independent, their &s;overeign could not authorize the capture of ve&s;&s;els; and yet, in defiance of law, of rea&s;on, and of ju&s;tice, they he&s;itated not to plunder indi&s;crimi|nately all tho&s;e who re&s;ided in America, among whom not a few were adherents to their cau&s;e.</P>

<P>IT mu&s;t be remarked, that this re&s;olution was pa&s;&s;ed when the mo&s;t ample means of retaliation were in our power, and the affairs of America wore the mo&s;t promi&s;e|ing a&s;pect, for the defeat before Quebec was not yet known, but, on the contrary, it was expected that ca|pital

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the efforts which had been made for reconciliation, the pro&s;pect of it &s;eemed every moment to be more remote. Every account from Great-Britain &s;erved to confirm the opinion, that nothing &s;hort of an unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on our part would be accepted; and every day's enquiry convinced the unprejudiced, that we had every thing to fear from a connection with them. As the governments of the &s;everal colonies had been ex|erci&s;ed under authority from the king of Great-Britain, they were reduced to the alternative of being in a manner without government, or of in&s;tituting new &s;y&s;tems on a ba&s;is purely republican. The former was cho&s;en, as the latter would have tended greatly to impede a future con|nection. But a &s;tate of political anarchy could not long be tolerable to any &s;ociety: the evils re&s;ulting from it mu&s;t at length have produced the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences; and it was impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee what might be the event of a conte&s;t in which mankind were &s;et loo&s;e from the re&s;traints of law. Impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e ideas, the Con|gre&s;s on the 15th of May, 1776, publi&s;hed the following re&s;olution:</P>
<P>"WHEREAS his Britannic maje&s;ty, in conjunction with the lords and commons of Great-Britain has, by a late act of parliament, excluded the inhabitants of the&s;e United Colonies from the protection of his crown; and whereas no an&s;wer whatever to the humble petitions of the colonies for redre&s;s of grievances and reconciliation with Great-Britain has been or is likely to be given, but the whole force of that kingdom, aided by foreign mer|cenaries, is to be exerted for the de&s;truction of the good people of the&s;e colonies; and whereas it appears ab&s;o|lutely irreconcileable to rea&s;on and good con&s;cience, for the people of the&s;e colonies now to take the oaths and

affirmations nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of any government under the crown of Great-Britain; and it is nece&s;&s;ary that the exerci&s;e of every kind of authority under the &s;aid crown &s;hould be totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and all the powers of government exerted under the authority of the people of the colonies, for the pre&s;ervation of internal peace, virtue, and good order, as well as for the defence of their lives, liberties and properties, again&s;t the ho&s;tile inva&s;ions and cruel depredations of their enemies;</P>
<P>"RESOLVED, That it be recommended to the re|&s;pective a&s;&s;emblies and conventions of the United Colo|nies, where no government &s;ufficient to the exigencies of their affairs hath been hitherto e&s;tabli&s;hed, to adopt &s;uch government as &s;hall in the opinion of the repre&s;entatives of the people be&s;t conduce to the happine&s;s and &s;afety of their con&s;tituents in particular, and America in general."</P>

<P>THE conduct of Great-Britain was &s;till the &s;ame com|pound of violence and fraud. While the &s;tores of poli|tical artifice were exhau&s;ted, to prevent us from obtaining foreign aid, nothing, which money or promi&s;es could ef|fect was left undone, to collect the mercenaries of Ger|many for our &s;ubjugation. Foiled in their former efforts, they called forth all their &s;trength; and to lull us into &s;ecurity at the &s;ame time, endeavoured to cover their de|&s;igns with the thin veil of reconciliation. For this pur|po&s;e they pa&s;&s;ed an act of parliament, and in con&s;equence of it appointed commi&s;&s;ioners, with power to grant par|dons to tho&s;e Americans, who would be &s;o guilty as to &s;olicit them. At length, fully convinced of what rea&s;on had long dictated, that no rational &s;ecurity for our li|berties could be obtained during a connection with Great-Britain, and that every idea of dependence tended to enfeeble our efforts, in a cau&s;e on which every thing was at &s;take, the fine &s;pun thread, which held the two countries to|gether, was cut on the memorable 4th of July, 1776, by the following</P>

<P>"WHEN, in the cour&s;e of human events, it be|comes nece&s;&s;ary for one people to di&s;&s;olve the political

bands which have connected them with another, and to a&s;&s;ume, among the powers of the earth, the &s;eparate and equal &s;tation to which the laws of nature and of na|ture's God entitle them, a decent re&s;pect to the opinions of mankind requires that they &s;hould declare the cau&s;es which impel them to the &s;eparation.</P>
<P>"WE hold the&s;e truths to be &s;elf-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable rights; that among the&s;e are life, liberty, and the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s.&mdash;That to &s;ecure the&s;e rights, governments are in&s;tituted among men, deriving their ju&s;t powers from the con&s;ent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes de&s;tructive of the&s;e ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to aboli&s;h it, and to in&s;titute new go+vernment, laying its foundation on &s;uch principles, and organizing its powers in &s;uch form, as to them &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t likely to effect their &s;afety and happine&s;s. Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;hould not be changed for light and tran&s;ient cau&s;es; and accordingly all experience hath &s;hewn, that mankind are more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uffer, while evils are &s;ufferable, than to right them&s;elves by aboli&s;hing the forms to which they are accu&s;tomed. But when a long train of abu&s;es and u&s;ur|pations, pur&s;uing invariably the &s;ame object, evinces a de|&s;ign to reduce them under ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off &s;uch government, and to provide new guards for their future &s;ecurity. Such has been the patient &s;ufferance of the&s;e colonies; and &s;uch is now the nece&s;&s;ity which con&s;trains them to alter their former &s;y&s;tems of government. The hi&s;tory of the pre|&s;ent king of Great-Britain is a hi&s;tory of repeated in|juries and u&s;urpations, all having in direct object the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an ab&s;olute tyranny over the&s;e &s;tates. To prove this, let facts be &s;ubmitted to a candid world:</P>
<P>"HE has refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to laws the mo&s;t whole&s;ome and nece&s;&s;ary for the public good.</P>
<P>"HE has forbidden his governors to pa&s;s laws of im|mediate and pre&s;&s;ing importance, unle&s;s &s;u&s;pended in their operation till his a&s;&s;ent &s;hould be obtained; and when &s;o &s;u&s;pended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="016625_0056_0F9D70536ADAFA50">"HE has refu&s;ed to pa&s;s other laws for the accommo|dation of large di&s;tricts of people, unle&s;s tho&s;e people would relinqui&s;h the right of repre&s;entation in the le|gi&s;lature; a right ine&s;timable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</P>
<P>"HE has called together legi&s;lative bodies at places un|u&s;ual, uncomfortable, and di&s;tant from the depo&s;itory of their public records, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of fatiguing them into compliance with his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>"HE has di&s;&s;olved repre&s;entative hou&s;es repeatedly, for oppo&s;ing, with manly firmne&s;s, his inva&s;ions on the rights of the people.</P>
<P>"HE has refu&s;ed for a long time, after &s;uch di&s;&s;o|lutions, to cau&s;e others to be elected; whereby the le|gi&s;lative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exerci&s;e; the &s;tate re|maining, in the mean time, expo&s;ed to all the dangers of inva&s;ion from without, and convul&s;ions within.</P>
<P>"HE has endeavoured to prevent the population of the&s;e &s;tates; for that purpo&s;e ob&s;tructing the laws for na|turalization of foreigners; refu&s;ing to pa&s;s others to en|courage their migrations hither, and rai&s;ing the condi|tions of new appropriations of lands.</P>
<P>"HE has ob&s;tructed the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, by refu&s;ing his a&s;&s;ent to laws for e&s;tabli&s;hing judiciary powers.</P>
<P>"HE has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their &s;alaries.</P>
<P>"HE has erected a multitude of new offices, and &s;ent hither &s;warms of officers to harra&s;s our people, and eat out their &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>"HE has kept among us, in times of peace, &s;tanding armies, without the con&s;ent of our legi&s;latures.</P>
<P>"HE has affected to render the military independent of, and &s;uperior to the civil power.</P>
<P>"HE has combined with others to &s;ubject us to a ju|ri&s;diction foreign to our con&s;titution, and unacknow|ledged by our laws; giving his a&s;&s;ent to their acts of pre|tended legi&s;lation:</P>
<P>"FOR quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="016625_0057_0F9D70552A233F28">"FOR protecting them, by a mock trial, from puni&s;h|ment for any murders which they &s;hould commit on the inhabitants of the&s;e &s;tates:</P>
<P>"FOR cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</P>
<P>"FOR impo&s;ing taxes on us without our con&s;ent:</P>
<P>"FOR depriving us, in many ca&s;es, of the benefits of trial by jury:</P>
<P>"FOR tran&s;porting us beyond &s;eas to be tried for pre|tended offences:</P>
<P>"FOR aboli&s;hing the free &s;y&s;tem of Engli&s;h laws in a neighbouring province, e&s;tabli&s;hing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries, &s;o as to ren|der it at once an example and fit in&s;trument for intro|ducing the &s;ame ab&s;olute rule into the&s;e colonies:</P>
<P>"FOR taking away our charters, aboli&s;hing our mo&s;t valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:</P>
<P>"FOR &s;u&s;pending our own legi&s;latures, and declaring them&s;elves inve&s;ted with power to legi&s;late for us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>"HE has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war again&s;t us.</P>
<P>"HE has plundered our &s;eas, ravaged our coa&s;ts, burnt our towns, and de&s;troyed the lives of our people.</P>
<P>"HE is, at this time, tran&s;porting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, de|&s;olation, and tyranny, already begun with circum&s;tances of cruelty and perfidy, &s;carcely paralleled in the mo&s;t bar|barous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</P>
<P>"HE has con&s;trained our fellow-citizens, taken cap|tive on the high &s;eas, to bear arms again&s;t their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall them&s;elves by their hands.</P>
<P>"HE has excited dome&s;tic in&s;urrections among&s;t us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the mercile&s;s Indian &s;avages, who&s;e known rule of warfare is an undi&s;tingui&s;hed de&s;truction, of all ages, &s;exes, and conditions.</P>
<P>"IN every &s;tage of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions we have pe|titioned for redre&s;s in the mo&s;t humble terms: Our re|peated
<PB N="57" REF="016625_0058_0F9D7055A9A08E20">
petitions have been an&s;wered only by repeated in|jury. A prince, who&s;e character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</P>
<P>"Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our Bri|ti&s;h brethren. We have warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their legi&s;lature to extend an unwarrantable juri&s;diction over us. We have reminded them of the cir|cum&s;tances of our emigration and &s;ettlement here. We have appealed to their native ju&s;tice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to di&s;avow the&s;e u&s;urpations, which would inevi|tably interrupt our connexions and corre&s;pondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of ju&s;tice and of con&s;angui|nity. We mu&s;t, therefore, acquie&s;ce in the nece&s;&s;ity, which denounces our &s;eparation, and hold them, as we hold the re&s;t of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.</P>
<P>"We, therefore, the repre&s;entatives of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in GENERAL CONGRESS a&s;&s;embled, appealing to the &s;upreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by authority of the good people of the&s;e colonies, &s;olemnly publi&s;h and declare, That the&s;e United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are ab&s;olved from all allegiance to the Briti&s;h crown, and that all political connexion between them and the &s;tate of Great-Britain, is, and ought to be, totally di&s;&s;olved; and that as FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, con|tract alliances, e&s;tabli&s;h commerce, and to do all other acts and things which INDEPENDENT STATES may of right do. And for the &s;upport of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of DIVINE PROVIDENCE, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our &s;acred honor."</P>
<P>THIS deci&s;ive &s;tep was taken in the face of the whole Briti&s;h force collected on our &s;hores. From that moment every thing a&s;&s;umes a new appearance: The propo&s;itions and &s;upplications for reconciliation, &s;o haughtily rejected, were done away. The metaphy&s;ical di&s;qui&s;itions about the
<PB N="58" REF="016625_0059_0F9D70566A0E24D0">
compatibility of colonial liberty and parliamentary au|thority in commercial &s;uperintendency by acts of legi&s;|lation, to the effect of external, exclu&s;ively of the idea of internal, taxation:&mdash;The&s;e, with all the jargon incident to them, were at an end. A &s;ingle clear point was put on the i&s;&s;ue of the conte&s;t, whether we &s;hould be conquered en|&s;laved provinces, or free and independent States? And on this propo&s;ition every man was in capacity to take his de|cided part.</P>
<P>UPON the 3d day of September, 1776, general Sulli|van, who had been made pri&s;oner by the enemy in the action of Long I&s;land, delivered the following me&s;&s;age to Congre&s;s from lord Howe:</P>
<P>"That, though he could not at pre&s;ent treat with Congre&s;s as &s;uch, yet he was very de&s;irous of having a conference with &s;ome of the members, whom he would con&s;ider for the pre&s;ent only as private gentlemen, and meet them him&s;elf as &s;uch, at &s;uch place as they &s;hould appoint:</P>
<P>"That he, in conjunction with general Howe, had full powers to compromi&s;e the di&s;pute between Great-Britain and America upon terms advantageous to both; the ob|taining of which delayed him near two months in Eng|land, and prevented his arrival at this place before the de|claration of independency took place:</P>
<P>"That he wi&s;hed a compact might be &s;ettled at this time, when no deci&s;ive blow was &s;truck, and neither party could &s;ay that they were compelled to enter into &s;uch agreement:</P>
<P>"That, in ca&s;e Congre&s;s were di&s;po&s;ed to treat, many things, which they had not as yet a&s;ked, might and ought to be granted them; and that, if upon the conference, they found any probable ground of an accommodation, the authority of Congre&s;s mu&s;t be afterwards acknow|ledged, otherwi&s;e the compact would not be complete."</P>
<P>ON the 5th of September the Congre&s;s came to the following re&s;olutions; <HI>to wit,</HI></P>
<P>"RESOLVED, That general Sullivan be reque&s;ted to
<PB N="59" REF="016625_0060_0F9D70572ACA1618">
inform lord Howe, that this Congre&s;s, being the repre|&s;entatives of the free and independent States of America, cannot with propriety &s;end any of its members, to confer with his lord&s;hip in their private characters, but that ever de&s;irous of e&s;tabli&s;hing peace on rea&s;onable terms, they will &s;end a committee of their body, to know whether he has any authority to treat with per&s;ons authorized by Con|gre&s;s for that purpo&s;e in behalf of America, and what that authority is, and to hear &s;uch propo&s;itions as he &s;hall think fit to make re&s;pecting the &s;ame:</P>
<P>"That the pre&s;ident be de&s;ired to write to general Wa&s;hington, and acquaint him, that it is the opinion of Congre&s;s, no propo&s;als for making peace between Great-Britain and the United States of America ought to be received or attended to, unle&s;s the &s;ame be made in writ|ing and addre&s;&s;ed to the repre&s;entatives of the &s;aid &s;tates in Congre&s;s, or per&s;ons authorized by them: And if ap|plication be made to him by any of the commanders of the Briti&s;h forces on that &s;ubject, that he inform them, that the&s;e United States, who entered into the war only for the defence of their lives and liberties, will cheerfully agree to peace on rea&s;onable terms, whenever &s;uch &s;hall be pro|po&s;ed to them in manner afore&s;aid."</P>
<P>THE committee was appointed the next day, and up|on the 17th made the following report,</P>
<P>"IN obedience to the orders of Congre&s;s, we have had a meeting with lord Howe. It was on Wedne&s;day la&s;t up|on Staten-I&s;land, oppo&s;ite to Amboy, where his lord&s;hip received and entertained us with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s.</P>
<P>"His lord&s;hip opened the conver&s;ation by acquainting us, that, tho' he could not treat with us as a committee of Congre&s;s, yet, as his powers enabled him to confer and con&s;ult with any private gentlemen of influence in the colonies, on the means of re&s;toring peace between the two countries, he was glad of this opportunity of conferring with us on that &s;ubject, if we thought our&s;elves at liberty to enter into a conference with him in that character. We ob&s;erved to his lord&s;hip, that, as our bu&s;ine&s;s was to hear, he might con&s;ider us in what light he plea&s;ed, and com|municate to us any propo&s;itions he might be authori&s;ed to
<PB N="60" REF="016625_0061_0F9D7057EC1EAD80">
make for the purpo&s;e mentioned; but, that we could con|&s;ider our&s;elves in no other character than that in which we were placed by order of Congre&s;s. His lord&s;hip then en|tered into a di&s;cour&s;e of a con&s;iderable length, which con|tained no explicit propo&s;ition of peace, except one, namely, That the colonies &s;hould return to their allegiance and obedience to the government of Great-Britain. The re&s;t con&s;i&s;ted principally of a&s;&s;urances, that there was an ex|ceeding good di&s;po&s;ition in the king and his mini&s;ters to make that government ea&s;y to us, with intimations, that, in ca&s;e of our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they would cau&s;e the offen&s;ive acts of parliament to be revi&s;ed, and the in&s;tructions to governors to be recon&s;idered; that &s;o, if any ju&s;t cau&s;es of complaint were found in the acts, or any errors in govern|ment were perceived to have crept into the in&s;tructions, they might be amended or withdrawn.</P>
<P>"WE gave it as our opinion to his lord&s;hip, that a re|turn to the domination of Great-Britain was not now to be expected. We mentioned the repeated humble petitions of the colonies to the king and parliament, which had been treated with contempt and an&s;wered only by additional in|juries; the unexampled patience we had &s;hewn under their tyrannical government, and that it was not till the late act of parliament, which denounced war again&s;t us, and put us out of the king's protection, that we declared our Independence; that this declaration had been called for by the people of the colonies in general; that every colony had approved of it, when made, and all now con&s;idered them&s;elves as Independent States, and were &s;ettling or had &s;ettled their governments accordingly; &s;o that it was not in the power of Congre&s;s to agree for them, that they &s;hould return to their former dependent &s;tate; that there was no doubt of their inclination to peace, and their wil|lingne&s;s to enter into a treaty with Britain, that might be advantageous to both countries; that, though his lord&s;hip had at pre&s;ent no power to treat with them as Independent States, he might, if there was the &s;ame good di&s;po&s;ition in Britain, much &s;ooner obtain fre&s;h powers from thence, for that purpo&s;e, than powers could be obtained by Con|gre&s;s, from the &s;everal colonies, to con&s;ent to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"His lord&s;hip then &s;aying, that he was &s;orry to find,
<PB N="61" REF="016625_0062_0F9D7058AD2BCC08">
that no accomodation was like to take place, put an end to the conference.</P>
<P>"Upon the whole, it did not appear to your commitee, that his lord&s;hip's commi&s;&s;ion contained any other autho|rity than that expre&s;&s;ed in the act of parliament, namely, that of granting pardons, with &s;uch exceptions as the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall think proper to make, and of declaring America, or any part of it, to be in the king's peace, upon &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: For, as to the power of enquiring into the &s;tate of America, which his lord&s;hip mentioned to us, and of conferring and con&s;ulting with any per&s;ons the commi&s;&s;ioners might think proper, and repre&s;enting the re&s;ult of &s;uch conver&s;ation to the mini&s;try, who provided the colonies would &s;ubject them&s;elves, might after all or might not, at their plea&s;ure, make any alterations in the former in&s;tructions to governors, or propo&s;e in parliament any amendment of the acts complained of, we apprehended any expectation from the effect of &s;uch a power would have been too uncertain and precarious to be relied on by Ame|rica, had &s;he &s;till continued in her &s;tate of dependence."</P>
<P>FROM this moment the war raged with the utmo&s;t vio|lence, and was pro&s;ecuted by the enemy with unabated vigor and barbarity. To recite the numerous in&s;tances in which their faith, &s;olemnly pledged, hath been broken, would be tedious and perhaps u&s;ele&s;s: Victory declared her&s;elf for a long time in favor of their &s;uperior numbers and &s;uperior di&s;cipline, and their in&s;olence was equal to their &s;ucce&s;s. Unable to comprehend the whole of the ob|ject they had undertaken, and overjoyed at the acqui&s;ition of the minuter parts, already the needy greedy para&s;ites of a voluptuous court had in imagination carved out our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions among them, and wantoned in the pro&s;pect of en|joying the fruits of our laborious indu&s;try. Every thing therefore, which looked like conciliation, was treated as a conce&s;&s;ion flowing from feeblene&s;s of &s;oul. The &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, flu&s;hed with hope and inured to guilt, turned a hard unfeeling eye upon the mi&s;eries of human nature, and directed, well pleas'd, the &s;torm of vengeance to the head of freedom. But that full tide of &s;ucce&s;s, which had carried their expectations &s;o high, began to ebb away: The gal|lant army commanded by Burgoyne, checked by impedi|ments
<PB N="62" REF="016625_0063_0F9D70596AF0C088">
which nature had thrown in his cour&s;e, at length &s;ubmitted, notwith&s;tanding the efforts of their accompli&s;hed general, to the determined bravery of their foes. The &s;plen|dor of our &s;ucce&s;s in that quarter called the attention of Europe to our fortitude and per&s;everance. The weight and importance of a country which could re&s;i&s;t the a&s;toni&s;hing efforts made by Great-Britain, were evident to the mo&s;t carele&s;s ob&s;ervation. The acknowledgement of our inde|pendence became therefore an object of &s;erious deliberation. Awakened from their dream of glory to a view of their danger, the mini&s;try of England determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to recover what they had wantonly thrown away.</P>

<P>THIS was referred to a committee, who, on the 22d of April, made the following report;</P>
<P>"THE Committee to whom was referred the general's letter of the 18th, containing a certain printed paper &s;ent from Philadelphia, purporting to be the draught of a Bill for declaring the <HI>intentions</HI> of the Parliament of Great-Britain, as to the <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> of what they are plea&s;ed to term their <HI>right</HI> of impo&s;ing taxes within the&s;e United States; and al&s;o the draught of a Bill to enable the King of Great-Britain to appoint Commi&s;&s;ioners, with powers to treat, con&s;ult and agree upon the means of quieting certain di&s;orders within the &s;aid States, beg leave to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>"THAT the &s;aid paper being indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated by emi&s;&s;aries of the enemy, in a partial and &s;ecret man|ner, the &s;ame ought to be forthwith printed for the pu|blic information.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="016625_0068_0F9D705E5B831358">"THE Committee cannot a&s;certain whether the con|tents of the &s;aid paper have been framed in Philadelphia, or in Great-Britain, much le&s;s whether the &s;ame are re|ally and truly intended to be brought into the Parliament of that kingdom, or whether the &s;aid Parliament will con|fer thereon the u&s;ual &s;olemnities of their laws. But are inclined to believe this will happen, for the following rea&s;ons:</P>
<P N="1">"1&s;t. BECAUSE their General hath made divers feeble efforts to &s;et on foot &s;ome kind of treaty during the la&s;t winter, though, either from a mi&s;taken idea of his own dignity and importance, the want of information, or &s;ome other cau&s;e, he hath not made application to tho&s;e who are inve&s;ted with a proper authority.</P>
<P N="2">"2dly. BECAUSE they &s;uppo&s;e that the fallacious idea of a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities will render the&s;e States remi&s;s in their preparations for war.</P>
<P N="3">"3dly. BECAUSE believing the Americans wearied with war, they &s;uppo&s;e we will accede to their terms for the &s;ake of peace.</P>
<P N="4">"4thly. BECAUSE they &s;uppo&s;e that our negociations may be &s;ubject to a like corrupt influence with their debates.</P>
<P N="5">"5thly. BECAUSE they expect from this &s;tep the &s;ame effects they did from what one of their mini&s;ters thought proper to call his <HI>conciliatory motion,</HI> viz. that it will pre|vent foreign powers from giving aid to the&s;e States; that it will lead their own &s;ubjects to continue a little longer the pre&s;ent war; and that it will detach &s;ome weak men in America from the cau&s;e of freedom and virtue.</P>
<P N="6">"6thly. BECAUSE their King, from his own &s;hewing, hath rea&s;on to apprehend that his fleets and armies, in&s;tead of being employed again&s;t the territories of the&s;e States, will be nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of his own dominions. And</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="68" REF="016625_0069_0F9D705EACFCE438">"7thly. BECAUSE the impracticability of &s;ubjugating this country being every day more and more manife&s;t, it is their intere&s;t to extricate them&s;elves from the war upon any terms.</P>
<P>"THE Committee beg leave further to ob&s;erve, That, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition the matters contained in the &s;aid paper will really go into the Briti&s;h Statute Book, they &s;erve to &s;hew, in a clear point of view, the weakne&s;s and wicked|ne&s;s of the enemy.</P>
<P>"THEIR WEAKNESS,</P>
<P N="1">"1&s;t. BECAUSE they formerly declared, not only that they had a right to bind the inhabitants of the&s;e States in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, but al&s;o that the &s;aid inhabitants &s;hould <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> and <HI>unconditionally</HI> &s;ubmit to the exerci&s;e of that right. And this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion they have endeavoured to exact by the &s;word. Receding from this claim, there|fore, under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, &s;hews their inability to enforce it.</P>
<P N="2">"2dly. BECAUSE their Prince hath heretofore rejected the humble&s;t petitions of the Repre&s;entatives of America, praying to be con&s;idered as &s;ubjects, and protected in the enjoyment of peace, liberty and &s;afety; and hath waged a mo&s;t cruel war again&s;t them, and employed the &s;avages to butcher innocent women and children. But now the &s;ame Prince pretends to treat with tho&s;e very Repre&s;entatives, and grant to the <HI>arms</HI> of America what he refu&s;ed to her <HI>prayers.</HI></P>
<P N="3">"3dly. BECAUSE they have uniformly labored to conquer this continent, rejecting every idea of accommo|dation propo&s;ed to them, from a confidence in their own &s;trength. Wherefore it is evident, from the change in their mode of attack, that they have lo&s;t this confidence. And</P>
<P N="4">"4thly. BECAUSE the con&s;tant language, &s;poken not only by their Mini&s;ters, but by the mo&s;t public and au|thentic acts of the nation, hath been, that it is incom|patible with their dignity to treat with the Americans while
<PB N="69" REF="016625_0070_0F9D705F6B33EBD8">
they have arms in their hands. Notwith&s;tanding which, an offer is now about to be made for treaty.</P>
<P>"THE WICKEDNESS and INSINCERITY of the enemy appear from the following con&s;iderations:</P>
<P N="1">"1&s;t. EITHER the <HI>Bills</HI> now to be pa&s;&s;ed contain a di|rect or indirect ce&s;&s;ion of a part of their former claims, or they do not. If they do, then it is acknowledged that they have &s;acrificed many brave men in an unju&s;t quarrel. If they no not, then they are calculated to deceive America into terms, to which neither argument before the war, nor force &s;ince, could procure her a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P N="2">"2dly. THE fir&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Bills</HI> appears, from the title, to be a declaration of the <HI>intentions</HI> of the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment concerning the exerci&s;e of the <HI>right of impo&s;ing taxes</HI> within the&s;e States. Wherefore, &s;hould the&s;e States treat under the &s;aid Bill, they would indirectly <HI>acknowledge</HI> that right, to obtain which acknowledgment the pre&s;ent war hath been avowedly undertaken and pro&s;ecuted on the part of Great-Britain.</P>
<P N="3">"3dly. SHOULD &s;uch pretended right be &s;o acquie&s;ced in, then, of con&s;equence, the &s;ame might be exerci&s;ed whenever the Briti&s;h Parliament &s;hould find them&s;elves in a different <HI>temper</HI> and <HI>di&s;po&s;ition;</HI> &s;ince it mu&s;t depend up|on tho&s;e, and &s;uch like contingencies, how far men will act according to their former <HI>intentions.</HI></P>
<P N="4">"4thly. THE &s;aid fir&s;t Bill, in the body thereof, con|taineth no new matter, but is preci&s;ely the &s;ame with the motion before-mentioned, and liable to all the objections which lay again&s;t the &s;aid motion, excepting the follow|ing particular, viz. that <HI>by the motion</HI> actual taxation was to be &s;u&s;pended, &s;o long as America &s;hould give as much as the &s;aid Parliament might think proper: Whereas, <HI>by the propo&s;ed Bill,</HI> it is to be &s;u&s;pended, as long as future Parliaments continue of the &s;ame mind with the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="5">"5thly. FROM the &s;econd Bill it appears, that the Bri|ti&s;h King may, if he plea&s;es, appoint Commi&s;&s;ioners to
<PB N="70" REF="016625_0071_0F9D706029D71AF8">
<HI>treat</HI> and <HI>agree</HI> with tho&s;e, whom they plea&s;e, about a va|riety of things therein mentioned. But &s;uch treaties and agreements are to be of no validity without the concur|rence of the &s;aid Parliament, except &s;o far as they relate to the <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;ion</HI> of ho&s;tilities, and of certain of their Acts, the granting of pardons, and the appointing of Governors to the&s;e &s;overeign, free and independent States. Where|fore, the &s;aid Parliament have re&s;erved to them&s;elves, in <HI>expre&s;s words,</HI> the power of &s;etting a&s;ide any &s;uch treaty, and taking the advantage of any circum&s;tances which may ari&s;e to &s;ubject this continent to their u&s;urpations.</P>
<P N="6">"6thly. THE &s;aid Bill, by holding forth a tender of pardon, implies a criminality in our ju&s;tifiable re&s;i&s;tance, and con&s;equently, to treat under it would be an implied ac|knowledgment that the inhabitants of the&s;e States were, what Britain hath declared them to be, <HI>Rebels.</HI></P>
<P N="7">"7thly. THE inhabitants of the&s;e States being claimed by them as Subjects, they may infer, from the nature of the negociation now pretended to be &s;et on foot, that the &s;aid inhabitants would of right be afterwards bound by &s;uch laws as they &s;hould make. Wherefore any agreement entered into on &s;uch negociation might at any future time be repealed. And</P>
<P N="8">"8thly. BECAUSE the &s;aid Bill purports, that the Commi&s;&s;ioners therein mentioned may treat with private individuals; a mea&s;ure highly derogatory to the dignity of national character.</P>
<P>"FROM all which it appears evident to your Com|mittee, that the &s;aid Bills are intended to operate upon the hopes and fears of the good people of the&s;e States, &s;o as to create divi&s;ions among them, and a defection from the com|mon cau&s;e, now by the ble&s;&s;ing of Divine Providence draw|ing near to a favourable i&s;&s;ue. That they are the &s;equel of that in&s;idious plan, which, from the days of the Stamp-act down to the pre&s;ent time, hath involved this country in contention and blood&s;hed. And that, as in other ca&s;es &s;o in this, although circum&s;tances may force them at times to recede from their unju&s;tifiable claims, there can be no
<PB N="71" REF="016625_0072_0F9D7060EA3B7A48">
doubt but they will as heretofore, upon the fir&s;t favor|able occa&s;ion, again di&s;play that lu&s;t of domination, which hath rent in twain the mighty empire of Britain.</P>
<P>"UPON the whole matter, the Committee beg leave to report it as their opinion, that as the Americans united in this arduous conte&s;t upon principles of common intere&s;t, for the defence of common rights and privileges, which union hath been cemented by common calamities and by mutual good offices and affection, &s;o the great cau&s;e for which they contend, and in which all mankind are inter|e&s;ted, mu&s;t derive its &s;ucce&s;s from the continuance of that union. Wherefore any man or body of men, who &s;hould pre&s;ume to make any &s;eparate or partial convention or agree|ment with Commi&s;&s;ioners under the crown of Great-Britain, or any of them, ought to be con&s;idered and treated as open and avowed enemies of the&s;e United States.</P>
<P>"AND further your Committee beg leave to report it as their opinion, That the&s;e United States cannot, with propriety, hold any conference or treaty with <HI>any</HI> Com|mi&s;&s;ioners on the part of Great-Britain, unle&s;s they &s;hall, as a preliminary thereto, either withdraw their fleets and armies, or el&s;e, in po&s;itive and expre&s;s terms, acknow|ledge the Independence of the &s;aid States.</P>
<P>"AND ina&s;much as it appears to be the de&s;ign of the enemies of the&s;e States to lull them into a fatal &s;ecurity&mdash; to the end that they may act with a becoming weight and importance, it is the opinion of your Committee, That the &s;everal States be called upon to u&s;e the mo&s;t &s;trenuous exertions to have their re&s;pective quotas of continental troops in the field as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and that all the mi|litia of the &s;aid States be held in readine&s;s, to act as oc|ca&s;ion may require."</P>
<P>THIS report being read, and debated by paragraphs, was agreed to unanimou&s;ly, and publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>ON the next day Congre&s;s came to the following re&s;o|lution:</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="016625_0073_0F9D7061AA1554A8">"WHEREAS per&s;ua&s;ion and influence, the example of the deluded or wicked, the fear of danger, or the calamities of war, may have induced &s;ome of the &s;ubjects of the&s;e &s;tates to join, aid, or abet the Briti&s;h forces in America; and tho' now de&s;irous of returning to their duty, and anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hing to be received and reunited to their coun|try, they may be deterred by the fear of puni&s;hment; and whereas the people of the&s;e &s;tates are ever more ready to reclaim than to abandon, to mitigate than to increa&s;e the horrors of war, to pardon than to puni&s;h offenders:</P>
<P>"RESOLVED, That it be recommended to the legi&s;la|tures of the &s;everal &s;tates to pa&s;s laws, or to the executive authority of each &s;tate, if inve&s;ted with &s;ufficient power, to i&s;&s;ue proclamations offering pardon, with &s;uch excep|tions and under &s;uch limitations and re&s;trictions as the &s;everal &s;tates &s;hall think expedient, to &s;uch of their inhabi|tants or &s;ubjects who have levied war again&s;t any of the&s;e &s;tates, or who have adhered to, aided or abetted the enemy, and who &s;hall &s;urrender them&s;elves to any civil or military officer of any of the&s;e &s;tates, and &s;hall return to the &s;tate to which they may belong before the 10th day of June next: and it is recommended to the good and faithful ci|tizens of the&s;e &s;tates to receive &s;uch returning penitents with compa&s;&s;ion and mercy, and to forgive and bury in oblivion their pa&s;t failings and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions."</P>
<P>ON the 2d of May Mr. Simeon Deane arrived at York-Town with copies of the treaties with France, which were ratified on the 4th, and on the 8th the following addre&s;s was made to the people of America:</P>

<P>"THREE years have now pa&s;&s;ed away &s;ince the commencement of the pre&s;ent war. A war without parallel in the annals of mankind. It hath di&s;|played a &s;pectacle the mo&s;t &s;olemn that can po&s;&s;ibly be exhibited. On one &s;ide, we behold fraud and violence laboring in the &s;ervice of de&s;poti&s;m; on the other, virtue and fortitude &s;upporting and e&s;tabli&s;hing the rights of human nature.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="016625_0074_0F9D70627B39C9F8">"YOU cannot but remember how reluctantly we were dragged into this arduous conte&s;t; and how repeatedly, with the earne&s;tne&s;s of humble intreaty, we &s;upplicated a redre&s;s of our grievances from him who ought to have been the father of his people. In vain did we implore his protection: in vain appeal to the ju&s;tice, the gene|ro&s;ity, of Engli&s;hmen&mdash;of men who had been the guar|dians, the a&s;&s;ertors and vindicators of liberty thro' a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages: men, who, with their &s;words, had e&s;tabli&s;hed the firm barrier of freedom, and cemented it with the blood of heroes. Every effort was vain. For, even whil&s;t we were pro&s;trated at the foot of the throne, that fatal blow was &s;truck, which hath &s;eparated us for ever. Thus &s;purned, contemned, and in&s;ulted&mdash;thus driven by our enemies into mea&s;ures which our &s;ouls ab|horred&mdash;we made a &s;olemn appeal to the tribunal of un|erring wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice&mdash;to that Almighty ruler of princes who&s;e kingdom is over all.</P>
<P>"WE were then quite defencele&s;s. Without arms, without ammunition, without clothing, without &s;hips, without money, without officers &s;killed in war; with no other reliance but the bravery of our people and the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e. We had to contend with a nation great in arts and in arms, who&s;e fleets covered the ocean, who&s;e banners had waved in triumph thro' every quarter of the globe. However unequal this conte&s;t, our weakne&s;s was &s;till farther increa&s;ed by the enemies which America had nouri&s;hed in her bo&s;om. Thus expo&s;ed, on the one hand, to external force and internal divi&s;ions; on the other, to be compelled to drink of the bitter cup of &s;la|very, and to go &s;orrowing all our lives long; in this &s;ad alternative, we cho&s;e the former. To this alternative we were reduced by men, who, had they been animated by one &s;park of genero&s;ity, would have di&s;dained to take &s;uch mean advantage of our &s;ituation; or, had they paid the lea&s;t regard to the rules of ju&s;tice, would have con|&s;idered with abhorrence a propo&s;ition to injure tho&s;e who had faithfully fought their battles, and indu&s;triou&s;ly con|tributed to rear the edifice of their glory.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="016625_0075_0F9D70632A1210B8">"BUT, however great the inju&s;tice of our foes in com|mencing this war, it is by no means equal to the cruelty with which they have conducted it. The cour&s;e of their armies is marked by rapine and deva&s;tation. Thou&s;ands, without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex, have been driven from their peaceful abodes, to encounter the rigors of incle|ment &s;ea&s;ons; and the face of Heaven hath been in&s;ulted by the wanton conflagration of defencele&s;s towns. Their victories have been followed by the cool murder of men no longer able to re&s;i&s;t; and tho&s;e who e&s;caped from the fir&s;t act of carnage have been expo&s;ed, by cold, hunger, and nakedne&s;s, to wear out a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence in the tedious hours of confinement, or to become the de&s;troyers of their countrymen, of their friends, perhaps, dreadful idea! of their parents or children. Nor was this the outrageous barbarity of an individual, but a &s;y&s;tem of de|liberate malice, &s;tamped with the concurrence of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, and &s;anctioned with all the formalities of law. Nay, determined to di&s;&s;olve the clo&s;e&s;t bonds of &s;ociety, they have &s;timulated &s;ervants to &s;lay their ma&s;ters in the peaceful hour of dome&s;tic &s;ecurity. And, as if all this were in&s;ufficient to &s;lake their thir&s;t of blood, the blood of brothers, of unoffending brothers, they have excited the Indians again&s;t us; and a general, who calls him&s;elf a chri&s;tian, a follower of the merciful Je&s;us, hath dared to proclaim to all the world his intention of letting loo&s;e again&s;t us whole ho&s;ts of &s;avages, who&s;e rule of warfare is promi&s;cuous carnage, who rejoice to murder the infant &s;miling in its mother's arms, to inflict on their pri&s;oners the mo&s;t excruciating torments, and exhibit &s;cenes of horror from which nature recoils.</P>
<P>"WERE it po&s;&s;ible, they would have added to this terrible &s;y&s;tem, for they have offered the inhabitants of the&s;e &s;tates to be exported by their merchants to the &s;ickly, baneful climes of India, there to peri&s;h. An offer not accepted of, merely from the impracticability of carrying it into execution.</P>
<P>"NOTWITHSTANDING the&s;e great provocations, we have treated &s;uch of them as fell into our hands with tenderne&s;s, and &s;tudiou&s;ly endeavoured to alleviate the
<PB N="75" REF="016625_0076_0F9D7063F85C63F8">
afflictions of their captivity. This conduct we have pur|&s;ued &s;o far, as to be by them &s;tigmatized with cowardice, and by our friends with folly. But our dependence was not upon man. It was upon Him who hath commanded us to love our enemies, and to render good for evil. And what can be more wonderful than the manner of our de|liverances? How often have we been reduced to di&s;tre&s;s, and yet been rai&s;ed up? When the means to pro&s;ecute the war have been wanting to us, have not our foes them|&s;elves been rendered in&s;trumental in providing them? This hath been done in &s;uch a variety of in&s;tances, &s;o peculiarly marked almo&s;t by the direct interpo&s;ition of Providence, that not to feel and acknowledge his pro|tection, would be the height of impious ingratitude.</P>
<P>"AT length that God of battles, in whom was our tru&s;t, hath conducted us through the paths of danger and di&s;tre&s;s to the thre&s;holds of &s;ecurity. It hath now become morally certain, that, if we have courage to per&s;evere, we &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h our liberties and independence.&mdash;The haughty prince, who &s;purned us from his feet with contumely and di&s;dain,&mdash;and the parliament which pro&s;cribed us, now de&s;cend to offer terms of accommodation. Whil&s;t in the full career of victory, they pulled off the ma&s;k, and avowed their intended de&s;poti&s;m: But, having lavi&s;hed in vain the blood and trea&s;ure of their &s;ubjects in pur&s;uit of this exe|crable purpo&s;e, they now endeavour to en&s;nare us with the in&s;idious offers of peace. They would &s;educe you into a dependence, which nece&s;&s;arily, inevitably leads to the mo&s;t humiliating &s;lavery. And do they believe that you will accept the&s;e fatal terms? Becau&s;e you have &s;uffered the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of war, do they &s;uppo&s;e that you will ba&s;ely lick the du&s;t before the feet of your de&s;troyers? Can there be an American &s;o lo&s;t to the feelings which adorn human nature? To the generous pride, the elevation, the dignity of free|dom? Is there a man who would not abhor a dependence upon tho&s;e who have deluged his country in the blood of its inhabitants? We cannot &s;uppo&s;e this; neither is it po&s;&s;ible that they them&s;elves can expect to make many converts. What then is their intention? Is it not to lull you with the fallacious hopes of peace, until they can a&s;|&s;emble new armies to pro&s;ecute their nefarious de&s;igns?
<PB N="76" REF="016625_0077_0F9D7064AA3392D8">
If this is not the ca&s;e, why do they &s;train every nerve to levy men throughout their i&s;lands? Why do they meanly court each little tyrant of Europe to &s;ell them his unhappy &s;laves? Why do they continue to embitter the minds of the Savages again&s;t you? Surely this is not the way to conciliate the affections of America. Be not, therefore, deceived. You have &s;till to expect one &s;evere conflict. Your foreign alliances, though they &s;ecure your inde|pendence, cannot &s;ecure your country from de&s;olation, your habitations from plunder, your wives from in&s;ult or violation, nor your children from butchery. Foiled in their principal de&s;ign, you mu&s;t expect to feel the rage of di&s;appointed ambition. Ari&s;e then! To your tents! And gird you for the battle! It is time to turn the headlong current of vengeance upon the head of the de&s;troyer. They have filled up the mea&s;ure of their abominations, and like ripe fruit mu&s;t &s;oon drop from the tree. Altho' much is done, yet much remains to do. Expect not peace, whil&s;t any corner of America is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your foes. You mu&s;t drive them away from this land of promi&s;e, a land flowing indeed with milk and honey. Your brethren at the extremities of the continent already implore your friend&s;hip and protection. It is your duty to grant their reque&s;t. They hunger and thir&s;t after liberty. Be it yours to di&s;pen&s;e to them the heavenly gift. And what is there now to prevent it?</P>
<P>"AFTER the unremitted efforts of our enemies, we are &s;tronger than before. Nor can the wicked emi&s;&s;aries, who &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly labor to promote their cau&s;e, point out any one rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that we &s;hall not receive daily acce&s;&s;ions of &s;trength. They tell you, it is true, that your money is of no value; and your debts &s;o enormous they can never be paid. But we tell you, that if Britain pro&s;ecutes the war another campaign, that &s;ingle cam|paign will co&s;t her more than we have hitherto expanded. And yet the&s;e men would prevail upon you to take up that immen&s;e load, and for it to &s;acrifice your deare&s;t rights. For, &s;urely, there is no man &s;o ab&s;urd as to &s;uppo&s;e, that the lea&s;t &s;hadow of liberty can be pre&s;erved in a dependent connexion with Great-Britain. From the nature of the thing it is evident, that the only &s;ecurity you could ob|tain,
<PB N="77" REF="016625_0078_0F9D70657A328F40">
would be the ju&s;tice and moderation of a parliament who have &s;old the rights of their own con&s;tituents. And this &s;lender &s;ecurity is &s;till farther weakened, by the con|&s;ideration that it was pledged to rebels, (as they unju&s;tly call the good people of the&s;e &s;tates) with whom they think they are not bound to keep faith by any law what&s;oever. Thus would you be ca&s;t bound among men, who&s;e minds (by your virtuous re&s;i&s;tence) have been &s;harpened to the keene&s;t edge of revenge. Thus would your children, and your childrens children, be, by you, forced to a partici|pation in all their debts, their wars, their luxuries and their crimes. And this mad, this impious &s;y&s;tem they would lead you to adopt, becau&s;e of the derangement of your finances.</P>
<P>"IT becomes you deeply to reflect on this &s;ubject. Is there a country on earth, which hath &s;uch re&s;ources for the payment of her debts as America? Such an exten&s;ive territory? So fertile, &s;o ble&s;&s;ed in its climate and pro|ductions? Surely there is none. Neither is there any to which the wi&s;e Europeans will &s;ooner confide their pro|perty. What then are the rea&s;ons that your money hath depreciated? Becau&s;e no taxes have been impo&s;ed to carry on the war. Becau&s;e your commerce hath been inter|rupted by your enemy's fleets. Becau&s;e their armies have ravaged and de&s;olated a part of your country, Becau&s;e their agents have villainou&s;ly counterfeited your bills. Becau&s;e extortioners among you, inflamed with the lu&s;t of gain, have added to the price of every article of life. And becau&s;e weak men have been artfully led to believe that it is of no value. How is this dangerous di&s;ea&s;e to be remedied? Let tho&s;e among you, who have lei&s;ure and opportunity, collect the monies which individuals in their neighbourhood are de&s;irous of placing in the public funds. Let the &s;everal legi&s;latures &s;ink their re&s;pective emi&s;&s;ions, that &s;o, there being but one kind of bills, there may be le&s;s danger of counterfeits. Refrain a little while from purcha&s;ing tho&s;e things which are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary, that &s;o tho&s;e who have engro&s;&s;ed commodities may &s;uffer (as they de&s;ervedly will) the lo&s;s of their ill-gotten hoards, by rea&s;on of the commerce with foreign nations, which their fleets will protect. Above all, bring forward
<PB N="78" REF="016625_0079_0F9D70675331BDF8">
your armies into the field. Tru&s;t not to appearances of peace or &s;afety. Be a&s;&s;ured that, unle&s;s you per&s;evere, you will be expo&s;ed to every &s;pecies of barbarity. But if you exert the means of defence which God and nature have given you, the time will &s;oon arrive when every man &s;hall &s;it under his own vine and under his own fig-tree, and there &s;hall be none to make him afraid.</P>
<P>"THE &s;weets of a free commerce with every part of the earth will &s;oon reimbur&s;e you for all the lo&s;&s;es you have &s;u&s;tained. The full tide of wealth will flow in upon your &s;hores, free from the arbitrary impo&s;itions of tho&s;e who&s;e intere&s;t and who&s;e declared policy it was to check your growth. Your intere&s;ts will be fo&s;tered and nouri&s;hed by governments that derive their power from your grant, and will therefore be obliged, by the influence of cogent nece&s;&s;ity, to exert it in your favor.</P>
<P>"IT is to obtain the&s;e things that we call for your &s;trenuous, unremitted exertions. Yet do not believe that you have been or can be &s;aved merely by your own &s;trength. No! It is by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven, and this you mu&s;t a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivate by acts which Heaven ap|proves. Thus &s;hall the power and the happine&s;s of the&s;e &s;overeign, free and independent States, founded on the virtue of their citizens, increa&s;e, extend and endure, until the Almighty &s;hall blot out all the empires of the earth."</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"WITH an earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;top the further ef|fu&s;ion of blood and the calamities of war, we communicate to you, with the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible delay after our arrival in this city, a copy of the commi&s;&s;ion with which his Maje&s;ty is plea&s;ed to honor us, as al&s;o the acts of Parliament on which it is founded. And, at the &s;ame time that we a&s;&s;ure you of our mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire to re-e&s;tabli&s;h, on the ba&s;is of equal freedom and mutual &s;afety, the tranquillity of this once happy empire, you will ob|&s;erve that we are ve&s;ted with powers equal to the purpo&s;e, and &s;uch as are even unprecedented in the annals of our hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>"IN the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our affairs, though fraught with &s;ubjects of mutual regret, all parties may draw &s;ome degree of con&s;olation, and even au&s;picious hope, from the recollection that cordial reconciliation and affection have, in our own and other empires, &s;ucceeded to con|tentions and temporary divi&s;ions not le&s;s violent than tho&s;e we now experience.</P>
<P>"WE wi&s;h not to recall &s;ubjects which are now no longer in controver&s;y, and will re&s;erve to a proper time of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, both the hopes of mutual benefit, and the con&s;ideration of evils, that may naturally contribute to determine your re&s;olutions, as well as our own, on this important occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>"THE acts of Parliament which we tran&s;mit to you having pa&s;&s;ed with &s;ingular unanimity, will &s;ufficiently evince the di&s;po&s;ition of Great-Britain, and &s;hew that the
<PB N="87" REF="016625_0088_0F9D706DA9F950C8">
terms of agreement in contemplation with his Maje&s;ty and with Parliament are &s;uch as come up to every wi&s;h that North-America, either in the hour of temperate deliberation or of the utmo&s;t apprehen&s;ion of danger to liberty, has expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"MORE effectually to demon&s;trate our good intentions, we think proper to declare, even in this our fir&s;t commu|nication, that we are di&s;po&s;ed to concur in every &s;atisfac|tory and ju&s;t arrangement towards the following among other purpo&s;es:</P>
<P>"TO con&s;ent to a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, both by &s;ea and land.</P>
<P>"TO re&s;tore free intercour&s;e, to revive mutual affec|tion, and renew the common benefits of naturalization, through the &s;everal parts of this empire.</P>
<P>"TO extend every freedom to trade that our re&s;pec|tive intere&s;ts can require.</P>
<P>"TO agree that no military forces &s;hall be kept up in the different &s;tates of North-America, without the con|&s;ent of the general Congre&s;s of particular A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>"TO concur in mea&s;ures calculated to di&s;charge the debts of America, and to rai&s;e the credit and value of the paper circulation.</P>
<P>"TO perpetuate our union by a reciprocal deputation of an agent or agents from the different States, who &s;hall have the privilege of a &s;eat and voice in the Parlia|ment of Great-Britain; or, if &s;ent from Britain, in that ca&s;e to have a &s;eat and voice in the A&s;&s;emblies of the dif|ferent States to which they may be deputed re&s;pectively, in order to attend the &s;everal intere&s;ts of tho&s;e by whom they are deputed.</P>
<P>"IN &s;hort, to e&s;tabli&s;h the power of the re&s;pective le|gi&s;latures in each particular State, to &s;ettle its revenue, its civil and military e&s;tabli&s;hment, and to exerci&s;e a per|fect
<PB N="88" REF="016625_0089_0F9D706E694AB978">
freedom of legi&s;lation and internal government, &s;o that the Briti&s;h States throughout North-America, acting with us in peace and war under one common &s;overeign, may have the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege, that is &s;hort of a total &s;eparation of intere&s;ts, or con&s;i&s;tent with that union of force, on which the &s;afety of our com|mon religion and liberty depends.</P>
<P>"IN our anxiety for pre&s;erving tho&s;e &s;acred and e&s;&s;en|tial intere&s;ts, we cannot help taking notice of the in&s;i|dious interpo&s;ition of a power, which has, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the&s;e colonies, been actuated with enmity to us both. And notwith&s;tanding the pretended date or pre&s;ent form of the French offers to North-America, yet it is notorious that the&s;e were made in con&s;equence of the plans of accommodation previou&s;ly concerted in Great-Britain, and with a view to prevent our reconciliation, and to prolong this de&s;tructive war.</P>
<P>"BUT we tru&s;t that the inhabitants of North-America, connected with us by the neare&s;t ties of con&s;anguinity, &s;peaking the &s;ame language, intere&s;ted in the pre&s;ervation of &s;imilar in&s;titutions, remembering the former happy in|tercour&s;e of good offices, and forgetting recent animo|&s;ities, will &s;hrink from the thought of becoming an ac|ce&s;&s;ion of force to our late mutual enemy, and will prefer a firm, a free and perpetual coalition with the parent &s;tate, to an in&s;incere and unnatural foreign alliance.</P>
<P>"THIS di&s;patch will be delivered to you by Doctor Fergu&s;on, the Secretary to his Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ion. And for further explanation and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of every &s;ub|ject of difference, we de&s;ire to meet with you, either col|lectively or by deputation, at New-York, Philadelphia, York-Town, or &s;uch other place as you may propo&s;e. We think it right, however to apprize you, that his Ma|je&s;ty's in&s;tructions, as well as our own de&s;ire to remove from the immediate &s;eat of war, in the active operations of which we cannot take any part, may induce us &s;peedi|ly to remove to New-York: But the Commander in Chief of his Maje&s;ty's land forces, who is joined with us in this commi&s;&s;ion, will, if it &s;hould become eligible, either
<PB N="89" REF="016625_0090_0F9D7070F615DB10">
concur with us in a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities, or will fur|ni&s;h all nece&s;&s;ary pa&s;&s;ports and &s;afe conduct to facilitate our meeting, and we &s;hall of cour&s;e expect the &s;ame of you.</P>
<P>"IF, after the time that may be nece&s;&s;ary to con|&s;ider this communication and tran&s;mit your an&s;wer, the horrors and deva&s;tations of war &s;hould continue, we call God and the world to witne&s;s, that the evils which mu&s;t follow, are not to be imputed to Great-Britain: And we cannot, without the mo&s;t real &s;orrow, anticipate the pro&s;pect of calamities, which we feel the mo&s;t ardent de|&s;ire to prevent.

</LETTER>
<P>ON this occa&s;ion it is to be ob&s;erved, that a circum|&s;tance had intervened between the re&s;olutions of the 22d of April and the receipt of the letter from the Commi&s;|&s;ioners. This was the arrival of the copies of treaties en|tered into with his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, which was the fir&s;t intelligence which had been received from Europe in the &s;pace of a year. The re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e there|fore on the 22d of April were founded &s;imply on the firm determination under no change of fortune whatever to re|cede from the declaration of independence in July 1776, and for this rea&s;on, as a preliminary to any treaty, it was required that Great-Britain &s;hould either acknowledge our independence or withdraw her fleets and armies, becau&s;e upon no other principle could America be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s that degree of equality and freedom which is e&s;&s;ential to the validity of national compacts. The treaty with France being out of the que&s;tion, had the&s;e preliminaries been complied with, we &s;hould have been bound in honor, as
<PB N="98" REF="016625_0099_0F9D7077A3C516D8">
we certainly were by inclination and the principles of humanity, to enter upon a conference for the purpo&s;e of &s;heathing the &s;word <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> But &s;ince by that treaty the United States could not upon a certain contingency make either peace or truce without the con&s;ent of her ally, it became nece&s;&s;ary to provide that any treaties to be made &s;hould not be incon&s;i&s;tent with treaties already &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting.</P>
<P>AS to the conditions or terms offered by the Commi&s;|&s;ioners it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the fir&s;t is <Q>to extend every freedom to trade that our re&s;pective intere&s;ts can require.</Q> A propo&s;ition which, from the very nature of things, is impracticable, or if practicable, is on their part a rea&s;on why reconciliation is unnece&s;&s;ary; for certainly if the&s;e intere&s;ts are compatible, they may be regulated by treaty, nay they would regulate them&s;elves. Individuals would con|&s;ult their private intere&s;ts, and national intere&s;t is nothing more than the aggregate of the particular advantages re&s;ult|ing to the &s;ubjects of a &s;tate from their private indu&s;try and di&s;cernment. But the intere&s;t of America requires that &s;he &s;hould trade freely to every part of the earth, while on the other hand it is the intere&s;t of Great-Britain to confine our commerce to the ports of her own i&s;land. Nothing then could be more in&s;idious than this offer; for the independence of America being given up, the Briti&s;h parliament mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily have become &s;upreme, at lea&s;t in matters which were heretofore con&s;idered as external to America. Of con|&s;equence they alone would have been judges of our re|&s;pective intere&s;ts, and in ca&s;es where the&s;e were oppo&s;ed, we may ea&s;ily determine their judgment.</P>
<P>THE next offer is, that <Q>no military force &s;hould be kept up in America without the con&s;ent of Congre&s;s or the particular A&s;&s;emblies.</Q> To which every objection lies: For, 1&s;t. &s;uppo&s;ing them to abide literally by &s;uch agreement, we lay open to all the arts of &s;eduction, which long and &s;ucce&s;sful practice could teach them to make u&s;e of again&s;t both the one and the other. 2dly. On any oc|ca&s;ion, which either the exi&s;tence or apprehen&s;ion of a foreign war might give ri&s;e to, this con&s;ent would na|turally flow from a regard to immediate &s;afety, and be af|terwards
<PB N="99" REF="016625_0100_0F9D707A8AC50CB0">
u&s;ed for our certain de&s;truction. But, 3dly. on this, as well as every other propo&s;ition they either did or could make, it is to be ob&s;erved that in the fir&s;t in&s;tance the parliament might di&s;&s;ent immediately and take an op|portunity to cru&s;h all oppo&s;ition, while we were at once di&s;armed at home and di&s;graced for our perfidy abroad. And, 4thly. Should the moment be &s;o unfavorable, or they &s;o hone&s;t as not to make the attempt, any future parlia|ment would be in legal capacity to di&s;annul an agreement who&s;e validity was derived from the former &s;anction of the &s;ame legi&s;lature; &s;o that during all the po&s;&s;ible events, which time might give birth to, we &s;hould have been ex|po&s;ed to their attempts, whil&s;t laboring under a weight of debt, and &s;ore from the wounds of our ob&s;tinate conte&s;t.</P>
<P>THE third offer is, <Q>to concur in mea&s;ures calculated to di&s;charge the debts of America and to rai&s;e the cre|dit and value of the paper circulation.</Q> On which it is to be ob&s;erved, that as our debt con&s;i&s;ted of this paper cir|culation, &s;o any mea&s;ures to di&s;charge it, that is to &s;ink a part, mu&s;t rai&s;e the value of the remainder. Now for this purpo&s;e taxation was alone nece&s;&s;ary, and indeed the only &s;tep which either they or we could take for that purpo&s;e: Their generous offer therefore was nothing more than to concur in taxing us to pay our own debts. In return for this, however, we were to be united with them, and con|&s;equently become &s;ecurity for payment of their debts, which are enormous. The following &s;hort calculation is worthy of attention: 120,000,000 of dollars, at &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence per dollar, is &pound;45,000,000, and exchange being at 1000 per cent, which is the pre&s;ent rate, this &s;um is worth &pound;4,500,000 &s;terling only. But at all events the pre&s;ent debt of America ought not to be e&s;timated at above &pound;10,000,000 &s;terling.</P>
<P>THEIR offer then &s;tands thus, if you will &s;tand &s;ecurity for and eventually pay your part of &pound;150,000,000 &s;terling which we owe, we will con&s;ent to your taxing your&s;elves to pay &pound;10,000,000 &s;terling, which you owe. To com|ment on an offer of this kind would be ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>THE fourth offer is, <Q>to perpetuate our union by a re|ciprocal
<PB N="100" REF="016625_0101_0F9D707B2B6901B0">
deputation of an agent or agents from the dif|ferent &s;tates, who &s;hall have the privilege of a &s;eat and voice in the parliament of Great-Britain, or if &s;ent from Britain, in that ca&s;e to have a &s;eat and voice in the a&s;&s;emblies of the different &s;tates, to which they may be deputed re&s;pectively, in order to attend to the &s;everal intere&s;ts of tho&s;e by whom they are deputed.</Q> Or, in other words, to perpetuate our &s;lavery, by taking from us, on the one hand, the objection again&s;t their tyrannous acts, that we were not repre&s;ented in the legi&s;lature which pa&s;&s;ed them, though in fact &s;uch repre&s;entation would be merely illu&s;ory and ineffectual. And on the other, by &s;ending mi|ni&s;terial agents, artful, plau&s;ible and wicked, to influence the debates of our legi&s;latures, and give a voice among the immediate repre&s;entatives of the people on matters even of the mo&s;t internal nature. No greater in&s;ult was ever of|fered to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind. Had the propo&s;al, particularly the latter part of it, been made before the commencement of the conte&s;t, it was &s;ufficient in it&s;elf to have rou&s;ed us to arms. If accepted and executed, in all the &s;tates it mu&s;t have been pernicious, but in tho&s;e called royal governments, would have &s;tood thus: A legi&s;lature con&s;i&s;ting of three branches, 1&s;t. A governor appointed by the king during plea&s;ure. 2dly. A council appointed by the king during plea&s;ure. 3dly. An a&s;&s;embly partly ap|pointed by the king and partly by the people, but all hold|ing their &s;eats during the king's plea&s;ure&mdash;The laws pa&s;&s;ed by this legi&s;lature to be of no validity without the king's con&s;ent&mdash;A repre&s;entative to be appointed by this legi&s;la|ture, to &s;it in a hou&s;e of commons, con&s;i&s;ting of more than five hundred members, and thereby to validate any law, which they might pa&s;s to bind the people of that &s;tate. If this be compared with <HI>"the freedom they profer to extend to trade,"</HI> &s;ome faint idea may be formed of the meditated &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t offer is, <Q>to e&s;tabli&s;h the power of the re|&s;pective legi&s;latures in each particular &s;tate, to &s;ettle its revenue, its civil and military e&s;tabli&s;hment, and to exerci&s;e a perfect freedom of legi&s;lation and internal go|vernment, &s;o that the Briti&s;h &s;tates throughout North-America, acting with us in peace and war under one
<PB N="101" REF="016625_0102_0F9D707BE97D8D30">
common &s;overeign, may have the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege that is &s;hort of a total &s;eparation of in|tere&s;ts, or con&s;i&s;tent with that union of force on which the &s;afety of our common religion and liberty depends.</Q> The fir&s;t part of this is ridiculous, &s;ince all the &s;tates have taken &s;ome forms of government, the legi&s;latures of which are obeyed, and con&s;equently their power e&s;tabli&s;hed already; the object therefore, taking it in compari&s;on with what goes before, is to overturn the free legi&s;latures already e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and in their &s;tead to in&s;titute the ba&s;e and &s;lavi&s;h mixture contained in the third offer. The &s;econd part &s;erves to &s;hew more clearly (if po&s;&s;ible) the in&s;idious na|ture of their commi&s;&s;ion; for from this it appears, that the object of revenue is by no means given up, nor the de&s;ign of keeping a military force in America relinqui&s;hed. The third part is nugatory, for having before marked out the kind of legi&s;lature to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, even the unre|&s;trained acts of it would not prove the freedom of the people, but rather their &s;lavery, and yet it is clear that however free they might be to pa&s;s laws, there would have been a &s;uperior power in legal capacity to repeal them. From all this however they deduce, as a con&s;equence, that &s;hould we accede to their propo&s;itions, <HI>we &s;hould have the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege that is &s;hort of a total &s;eparation of intere&s;ts, or con&s;i&s;tent with that union of force,</HI> &amp;c. But this conclu&s;ion by no means follows from the pre|mi&s;es; on the contrary it is evident, that we &s;hould enjoy no one <HI>privilege,</HI> and have the <HI>irrevocable</HI> enjoyment of no one thing, unle&s;s it be &s;uppo&s;ed that to repent is to enjoy. For the &s;ake of this &s;ophi&s;tical &s;y&s;tem however we were to covenant, that we would act with them in peace and in war. The con&s;equence of which would have been, that we mu&s;t have contracted new debts, to promote their intere&s;ted views, before we had paid the &s;ums expended for our own defence, and have lavi&s;hed the be&s;t blood of America, to gratify the pride, pique, avarice, ambition, or revenge of a haughty de&s;pot, deaf to the prayers of &s;up|plicative millions, and dead to the feelings of ju&s;tice or hu|manity. One fact however they indirectly admit, that their &s;afety depends upon an union of force with us. The nece&s;|&s;ary con&s;equence is, that, notwith&s;tanding their pretended &s;uperiority, they mu&s;t not only make peace with us, but
<PB N="102" REF="016625_0103_0F9D707CAA0389F8">
it mu&s;t be on our own terms, provided the people of Ame|rica are &s;en&s;ible of their true intere&s;ts, and the repre&s;enta|tives of America have patience, firmne&s;s and di&s;cernment to take proper advantage of their own &s;ituation and cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE conci&s;e an&s;wer which Congre&s;s had given to the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners, placed them in a very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, and therefore it became nece&s;&s;ary for them to make &s;ome efforts to get out of it. For this purpo&s;e they &s;ent a letter, dated at New-York, the 11th of July, 1778, which was received and read in Congre&s;s the 18th, in the following words:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"WE received &s;oon after our arrival at this place, your an&s;wer to our letter of the 10th of June, and are &s;orry to find on your part any difficulties rai&s;ed which mu&s;t prolong the calamities of the pre&s;ent war.</P>
<P>"YOU propo&s;e to us as matter of choice one or other of two alternatives, which you &s;tate as preliminaries nece&s;&s;a|ry even to the beginning of a negociation for peace to this empire.</P>
<P>"ONE is an explicit acknowledgment of the Indepen|dence of the&s;e States. We are not inclined to di&s;pute with you about the meaning of words: But &s;o far as you mean the entire privilege of the people of North America to di&s;|po&s;e of their property, and to govern them&s;elves without any reference to Great-Britain, beyond what is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve that union of force, in which our mutual &s;afety and advantage con&s;i&s;t: We think, that &s;o far, their In|dependency is fully acknowledged in the terms of our let|ter of the 10th of June. And we are willing to enter up|on a fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with you, of all the circum&s;tances that may be nece&s;&s;ary to en&s;ure or even to enlarge that Inde|pendency.</P>
<P>"IN the other alternative you propo&s;e, that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould withdraw his fleets and his armies.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="016625_0104_0F9D707D6D936F48">"ALTHOUGH we have no doubt of his Maje&s;ty's di&s;|po&s;ition to remove every &s;ubject of unea&s;ine&s;s from the co|lonies, yet there are circum&s;tances of precaution again&s;t our ancient enemies, which, joined to the regard that mu&s;t be paid to the &s;afety of many, who, from affection to Great-Britain, have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to &s;uffer in this conte&s;t, and, to whom Great-Britain owes &s;upport at every expence of blood and trea&s;ure, that will not allow us to begin with this mea&s;ure. How &s;oon it may follow the fir&s;t advances to peace on your part, will de|pend on the favourable pro&s;pect you give of a reconcilia|tion with your fellow citizens of this Continent and with tho&s;e in Britain. In the mean time we a&s;&s;ure you that no circum&s;tance will give us more &s;atisfaction, than to find that the extent of our future connection is to be deter|mined on principles of mere rea&s;on and the con&s;iderations of mutual intere&s;t, on which we are willing likewi&s;e to re&s;t the permanency of any arrangements we may form.</P>
<P>"IN making the&s;e declarations we do not wait for the deci&s;ion of any military events. Having determined our judgement by what we believe to be the intere&s;ts of our country, we &s;hall abide by the declarations we now make in every po&s;&s;ible &s;ituation of our affairs.</P>

<P>UPON which the Congre&s;s came to the following re|&s;olution:</P>
<P>"WHEREAS Congre&s;s in a letter to the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners of the 17th of June la&s;t, did declare that they would be ready to enter upon the con&s;ideration of a treaty of peace and commerce, not incon&s;i&s;tent with trea|ties already &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, when the King of Great-Britain &s;hould demon&s;trate a &s;incere di&s;po&s;ition for that purpo&s;e; and that the only &s;olid proof of this di&s;po&s;ition, would be an explicit acknowledgement of the Independence of the&s;e States, or withdrawing his fleets and armies: And whereas, neither of the&s;e alternatives have been complied with, therefore.</P>
<P>"RESOLVED, That no an&s;wer be given to the letter of the 11th in&s;tant from the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners."</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="016625_0106_0F9D707EE984DC48">THE propo&s;al contained in the letter, to enlarge inde|pendence, is at the fir&s;t blu&s;h ab&s;urd:&mdash;Any &s;tate, the de|pendence of which could be le&s;&s;ened, is of con&s;equence not independent. The offer therefore is a mere jargon of words, and calculated, as indeed the whole letter appears, for the people, and particularly for tho&s;e whom they have thought proper to call our fellow-citizens of this conti|nent, or, in other words, the traitors who have joined the common enemy. But one of their great objects was, if po&s;|&s;ible, to draw the Congre&s;s into &s;ome kind of treaty or corre&s;pondence, in order that they might have where|withal to give weight to the calumnies they have pro|pagated, by declaring to the French court that the Con|gre&s;s were faithle&s;s, and indeed had actually bargained for the &s;ubjection of America, the price of which was to be paid by the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>IN con&s;i&s;tence with this plan, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to obtain an indirect acknowledgment of their authority, they, on the 26th of Augu&s;t, 1778, made a requi&s;ition of the troops of the convention of Saratoga, in the following terms:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>By the Earl of <HI>CARLISLE,</HI> Sir <HI>HENRY CLIN|TON,</HI> and <HI>WILLIAM EDEN,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> three of his maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed with &s;ufficient powers to treat, con&s;ult and agree upon the means of quieting the di&s;orders now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in certain of the colonies, plantations and provinces of North-America.</HEAD>
<P>"UPON a repre&s;entation from the commander in chief of his maje&s;ty's forces, that the troops lately &s;erving under lieutenant-general Burgoyne, notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;olemn convention entered into at Saratoga, in which it is &s;tipulated that the &s;aid troops &s;hould have a free pa&s;&s;age to Great-Britain, are neverthele&s;s, under various pretences, &s;till detained in New-England&mdash;The following remon&s;trance again&s;t the unju&s;t detention of tho&s;e troops, and requi&s;ition for their immediate relea&s;e, on the condition annexed to the article by which their pa&s;&s;age to England is &s;tipulated, are now &s;olemnly made to the American Congre&s;s:</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="016625_0107_0F9D707FA9BE8218">"WHEREAS the means that have been devi&s;ed by mankind to mitigate the horrors of war, and to facilitate the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace, depend on the faith of car|tels, military capitulations, conventions and treaties enter|ed into even during the continuance of ho&s;tilities: From whence all nations have agreed to ob&s;erve &s;uch conventions, as they revere the &s;acred obligations of humanity and ju&s;tice, and as they would avoid the horrid practice of re|taliations, which, however ju&s;tly due to the guilty, in &s;uch ca&s;es but too frequently fall on the innocent.</P>
<P>"AND whereas upon the&s;e con&s;iderations all breach of faith, even with an enemy, and all attempts to elude the force of military conventions, or to defeat their &s;alutary purpo&s;es by eva&s;ion or chicane, are ju&s;tly held in dete&s;ta|tion, and deemed unworthy of any de&s;cription of per&s;ons a&s;&s;uming the character or &s;tating them&s;elves as the repre|&s;entatives of nations.</P>
<P>"AND whereas it was &s;tipulated in the &s;econd article of the convention entered into at Saratoga between lieu|tenant-general Burgoyne and major-general Gates, <Q>That a free pa&s;&s;age be granted to the army under lieutenant-general Burgoyne to Great-Britain, upon condition of not &s;erving again in North-America during the pre&s;ent conte&s;t; and the port of Bo&s;ton is a&s;&s;igned for the entry of tran&s;ports, whenever general Howe &s;hall &s;o order:</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>AS the&s;e gentlemen did not appear with the proper let|ters of credence to an independent &s;tate, Congre&s;s could not di&s;cu&s;s &s;uch propo&s;itions without acknowledging in|directly the authority of the commi&s;&s;ion by which they were appointed; and in doing that they mu&s;t have ac|knowledged the authority of tho&s;e acts of parliament on which that commi&s;&s;ion was founded. But as an inde|pendent &s;tate they could not take notice of per&s;ons acting either under a commi&s;&s;ion or an act of parliament, the&s;e being of a dome&s;tic nature, and relative to internal polity, but without authenticity as to foreign powers.</P>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners then, on the one hand, had no right to make the demand, as it was not contained in their commi&s;&s;ion, and could not po&s;&s;ibly have been in con|templation at the time of granting it: Be&s;ides that, being in its nature purely military, it was the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of the Briti&s;h commander in chief. And, on the other hand, the Congre&s;s could not make a direct an&s;wer to it without receding from their right as repre&s;entatives of a &s;overeign and independent people.</P>
<P>BUT further: It being evident from the face of the re|qui&s;ition, when compared with their commi&s;&s;ion, that they offered what they had no power to perform, it follows that they de&s;igned to obtain the troops without giving the &s;olid &s;ecurity which had been rightfully demanded for their performance of the convention. And from thence it is a
<PB N="108" REF="016625_0109_0F9D7082518F6838">
clear inference, that they de&s;igned totally to di&s;regard the convention whenever the troops &s;hould be in their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;ons taken together, ought certainly to have prevented the Congre&s;s from taking any notice of <HI>their</HI> re|qui&s;ition. But one object of the commi&s;&s;ioners was, to find &s;ome ground for a charge again&s;t the Congre&s;s of a want of national faith and honor; and on that and every other occa&s;ion it was of importance that the people of America &s;hould have materials to form a judgment of the conduct of their repre&s;entatives. On the 4th of September, therefore, a few days after the receipt of that, with &s;ome other papers, they came to the following re&s;olution:</P>
<P>"WHEREAS Congre&s;s did, on the 8th day of January, 1778, re&s;olve, That the embarkation of lieutenant-general Burgoyne, and the troops under his command, be &s;u&s;pended till a di&s;tinct and explicit ratifica|tion of the convention of Saratoga &s;hall be properly notified by the court of Great-Britain to Congre&s;s:</P>
<P>"RESOLVED, That no ratification of the convention of Saratoga, which may be tendered in con&s;equence of powers which may reach that ca&s;e by con&s;truction and implica|tion, or which may &s;ubject whatever is tran&s;acted relative to it, to the future approbation or di&s;approbation of the parliament of Great-Britain, can be accepted by Congre&s;s."</P>
<P>ON the 19th of September, 1778, the following letter was received by Congre&s;s:</P>

The neglect of the requi&s;itions already made on this &s;ub|ject, is altogether unprecedented among parties at war. I now, however, repeat the demand, that the convention of

<P>I AM to &s;ignify to you his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, that you do take every nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep for the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of what is &s;tipulated in the convention of Saratoga, on the part of lieutenant-general Burgoyne; and that you do give the fulle&s;t a&s;&s;urance that the troops, when embarked, &s;hall be immediately &s;ent to Great-Britain, and every condition agreed upon between lieutenant-general Burgoyne and major-general Gates, re&s;pecting them, be faithfully ob&s;erved.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>IT is worthy of remark, that this extract is dated at Whitehall, &s;o early as the 12th of June, from whence to the 26th of Augu&s;t is 75 days; wherefore it is more than probable that it was received <HI>previous,</HI> and not <HI>&s;ub&s;equent,</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="016625_0111_0F9D70836A235698">
to the requi&s;ition made by the Commi&s;&s;ioners. This cir|cum&s;tance heightens the fraudulent complexion of the pro|cedure; and in any ca&s;e the extract &s;hews the decided opinion of the Briti&s;h court, that their Commi&s;&s;ioners had not the power by them pretended.</P>
<P>BUT further: The Congre&s;s had re&s;olved on the 8th of January, 1778, on the mo&s;t conclu&s;ive rea&s;ons, <Q>That the embarkation of lieutenant-general Burgoyne and the troops under his command be &s;u&s;pended till <HI>a di&s;tinct and explicit ratification</HI> of the convention of Saratoga &s;hall be properly notified by the court of Great-Britain to Con|gre&s;s.</Q> But in&s;tead of this, there is &s;imply a <HI>direction</HI> of a &s;ecretary of &s;tate to their general <Q>to give the fulle&s;t <HI>a&s;|&s;urances,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> which a&s;&s;urances, and the general who gave them, or the very &s;ecretary him&s;elf, might be di&s;avowed. The per&s;on who certifies the extract al&s;o might ea&s;ily be di&s;avowed; nay, it is very po&s;&s;ible that no &s;uch letter was ever written: Nor can we argue again&s;t &s;uch deceit from the ba&s;ene&s;s of it; for tho&s;e who would do the many treacherous acts which they had committed during the war, who had borrowed from felons of the mo&s;t pitiful kind the little vil|lainy of counterfeiting money, and with whom it was a fa|vorite maxim that no faith was to be kept with rebels, could hardly boggle at the &s;ending as an extract from a &s;ecretary of &s;tate's letter what really was not &s;uch an extract. But it is unnece&s;&s;ary to dwell on the&s;e objections; for the la&s;t paragraph of Sir Henry Clinton's letter was &s;o highly in|decent, that it would have been trea&s;on again&s;t the dignity of the people of America to have attended to it. The Congre&s;s, therefore, with great propriety, <Q>ordered that the &s;ecretary return the following an&s;wer: Sir, I am directed to inform you, that the Congre&s;s of the United States of America make no an&s;wer to in&s;olent letters.</Q></P>
<P>BEING thus foiled in their &s;everal attempts to deceive, nothing remained but to terrify. For this purpo&s;e they on the 3d of October, 1778, publi&s;hed the following mani|fe&s;to and proclamation:</P>

<P>"HAVING amply and repeatedly made known to the Congre&s;s, and having al&s;o proclaimed to the inhabitants of North-America in general, the benevolent overtures of Great-Britain towards a re-union and coalition with her colonies, we do not think it con&s;i&s;tent either with the duty we owe to our country, or with a ju&s;t re|gard to the characters we bear, to per&s;i&s;t in holding out offers, which, in our e&s;timation, required only to be known to be mo&s;t gratefully accepted; and we have accordingly, ex|cepting only the commander in chief, who will be detained by military duties, re&s;olved to return to England a few weeks after the date of this manife&s;to and proclamation.</P>
<P>"PREVIOUS, however, to this deci&s;ive &s;tep, we are led, by a ju&s;t anxiety for the great objects of our mi&s;&s;ion, to enlarge on &s;ome points which may not have been &s;uf|ficiently under&s;tood, to recapitulate to our fellow &s;ubjects the ble&s;&s;ings which we are empowered to confer, and to warn them of the continued train of evils to which they are at pre&s;ent blindly and ob&s;tinately expo&s;ing them&s;elves.</P>
<P>"TO the members of the Congre&s;s, then, we again declare, that we are ready to concur in all &s;atisfactory and ju&s;t arrangements for &s;ecuring to them and their re&s;pective con&s;tituents, the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace, with the ex|emption from any impo&s;ition of taxes by the parliament of
<PB N="112" REF="016625_0113_0F9D7084EB519598">
Great-Britain, and the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege con&s;i&s;tent with that union of intere&s;ts and force on which our mutual pro&s;perity and the &s;afety of our com|mon religion and liberty depend. We again a&s;&s;ert, that the members of the Congre&s;s were not authorized by their con&s;titution either to reject our offers without the previous con&s;ideration and con&s;ent of the &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies and Conventions, their con&s;tituents, or to refer us to pre|tended foreign treaties, which they know are delu&s;ively framed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and which have never yet been ratified by the people of this continent. And we once more remind the members of the Congre&s;s, that they are re&s;pon&s;ible to their countrymen, to the world, and to God, for the continuance of this war, and for all the mi&s;eries with which it mu&s;t be attended.</P>
<P>"TO the General A&s;&s;emblies and Conventions of the different colonies, plantations and provinces above-men|tioned, we now &s;eparately make the offers which we ori|ginally tran&s;mitted to the Congre&s;s; and we hereby call upon and urge them to meet expre&s;sly for the purpo&s;e of con&s;idering whether every motive, political as well as moral, &s;hould not decide their re&s;olution to embrace the occa&s;ion of cementing a free and firm coalition with Great-Britain. It has not been, nor is it, our wi&s;h, to &s;eek the objects which we are commi&s;&s;ioned to pur&s;ue, by fomenting popular divi&s;ions and partial cabals; we think &s;uch conduct would be ill &s;uited to the generous nature of the offers made, and unbecoming the dignity of the king and the &s;tate which makes them. But it is both our wi&s;h and our duty to encourage and &s;upport any men or bodies of men in their return of loyalty to our &s;overeign and of affection to our fellow-&s;ubjects.</P>
<P>"TO all others, free inhabitants of this once happy em|pire, we al&s;o addre&s;s our&s;elves. Such of them as are actually in arms, of what&s;oever rank or de&s;cription, will do well to recollect, that the grievances, whether real or &s;uppo&s;ed, which led them into this rebellion, have been for-ever removed, and that the ju&s;t occa&s;ion is arrived for their returning to the cla&s;s of peaceful citizens. But if the honors of a military life are become their object, let
<PB N="113" REF="016625_0114_0F9D7085A95A2A98">
them &s;eek tho&s;e honors under the banners of their right|ful &s;overeign, and in fighting the battles of the united Briti&s;h empire again&s;t our late mutual and natural enemy.</P>
<P>"TO tho&s;e who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion it is to exerci&s;e the functi|ons of religion on this continent, it cannot &s;urely be un|known, that the foreign power with which the Congre&s;s is endeavoring to connect them, has ever been aver&s;e to toleration, and inveterately oppo&s;ed to the intere&s;ts and freedom of the places of wor&s;hip which they &s;erve; and that Great-Britain, from whom they are for the pre&s;ent &s;e|parated, mu&s;t, both from the principles of her con&s;titution and of prote&s;tanti&s;m, be at all times the be&s;t guardian of religious liberty, and mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to promote and ex|tend it.</P>
<P>"TO all tho&s;e who can e&s;timate the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, and its influence over agriculture, arts and commerce, who can feel a due anxiety for the education and e&s;tabli&s;hment of their children, or who can place a ju&s;t value on do|me&s;tic &s;ecurity, we think it &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that they are made by their leaders to continue involved in all the calamities of war, without having either a ju&s;t object to pur&s;ue, or a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting grievance which may not in&s;tantly be redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"BUT if there be any per&s;ons who, diverted of mi&s;taken re&s;entments, and uninfluenced by &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;ts, really think that it is for the benefit of the colonies to &s;eparate them&s;elves from Great-Britain, and that, &s;o &s;eparated, they will find a con&s;titution more mild, more free, and better calculated for their pro&s;perity than that which they heretofore enjoyed, and which we are empowered and di&s;|po&s;ed to renew and improve; with &s;uch per&s;ons we will not di&s;pute a po&s;ition which &s;eems to be &s;ufficiently con|tradicted by the experience they have had. But we think it right to leave them fully aware of the change which the maintaining &s;uch a po&s;ition mu&s;t make in the whole na|ture and future conduct of this war; more e&s;pecially when to this po&s;ition is added the pretended alliance with the court of France.&mdash;The policy, as well as the benevolence of Great-Britain, have thus far checked the extremes of
<PB N="114" REF="016625_0115_0F9D708669973F50">
war, when they tended to di&s;tre&s;s a people &s;till con&s;idered as our fellow-&s;ubjects, and to de&s;olate a country &s;hortly to become again a &s;ource of mutual advantage: But when that country pro&s;e&s;&s;es the unnatural de&s;ign not only of e&s;tranging her&s;elf from us, but of mortgaging her&s;elf and her re&s;ources to our enemies, the whole conte&s;t is changed; and the que&s;tion is, how far Great-Britain may, by every means in her power, de&s;troy or render u&s;ele&s;s a connection contrived for her ruin, and for the aggrandizement of France. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances the laws of &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation mu&s;t direct the conduct of Great-Britain; and if the Briti&s;h colonies are to become an acce&s;&s;ion to France, will direct her to render that acce&s;&s;ion of as little avail as po&s;&s;ible to her enemy.</P>
<P>"IF, however, there are any who think, that notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e rea&s;onings, the independence of the colonies will, in the re&s;ult, be acknowledged by Great-Britain; to them we an&s;wer without re&s;erve, that we neither po&s;&s;e&s;s or expect powers for that purpo&s;e; and that, if Great-Britain could ever have &s;unk &s;o low as to adopt &s;uch a mea&s;ure, we &s;hould not have thought our&s;elves compellable to be the in&s;truments in making a conce&s;&s;ion, which would, in our opinion, be calamitous to the colonies, for whom it is made, and di&s;graceful, as well as calamitous, to the country from which it is required. And we think proper to de|clare, that in this &s;pirit and &s;entiment we have regularly written from this continent to Great-Britain.</P>
<P>"IT will now become the colonies in general to call to mind their own &s;olemn appeals to Heaven in the be|ginning of this conte&s;t, that they took arms only for the redre&s;s of grievances, and that it would be their wi&s;h, as well as their intere&s;t, to remain for-ever connected with Great-Britain.

As &s;oon, however, as it arrived, it produced the following &s;olemn appeal:</P>

<HEAD>By the <HI>CONGRESS</HI> of the United States of America, MANIFESTO.</HEAD>
<P>"THESE United States having been driven to ho&s;tilities by the oppre&s;&s;ive and tyrannous mea|&s;ures of Great-Britain; having been compelled to com|mit the e&s;&s;ential rights of man to the deci&s;ion of arms; and having been at length forced to &s;hake off a yoke which had grown too burthen&s;ome to bear, they declared them|&s;elves free and independent.</P>
<P>"CONFIDING in the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e; confiding in HIM who di&s;po&s;es of human events, although weak and unprovided, they &s;et the power of their enemies at defiance.</P>
<P>"IN this confidence they have continued through the various fortune of three bloody campaigns, unawed by the power, un&s;ubdued by the barbarity of their foes. Their virtuous citizens have borne, without repining, the lo&s;s of many things which make life de&s;irable. Their brave troops have patiently endured the hard&s;hips and dangers of a &s;ituation, fruitful in both beyond former example.</P>
<P>"THE Congre&s;s, con&s;idering them&s;elves bound to love their enemies, as children of that Being who is equally the Father of all; and de&s;irous, &s;ince they could not prevent, at lea&s;t to alleviate, the calamities of war, have &s;tudied to &s;pare tho&s;e who were in arms again&s;t them, and to lighten the chains of captivity.</P>
<P>"THE conduct of tho&s;e &s;erving under the king of Great-Britain hath, with &s;ome few exceptions, been diametrically oppo&s;ite. They have laid wa&s;te the open country, burned the defencele&s;s villages, and butchered the citizens of America. Their pri&s;ons have been the &s;laughter-hou&s;es of her &s;oldiers, their &s;hips of her &s;eamen,
<PB N="119" REF="016625_0120_0F9D708AEBA40710">
and the &s;evere&s;t injuries have been aggravated by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t in&s;ult.</P>
<P>"FOILED in their vain attempt to &s;ubjugate the un|conquerable &s;pirit of freedom, they have meanly a&s;&s;ailed the repre&s;entatives of America with bribes, with deceit, and the &s;ervility of adulation. They have made a mock of humanity, by the wanton de&s;truction of men: They have made a mock of religion, by impious appeals to God whil&s;t in the violation of his &s;acred commands: They have made a mock even of rea&s;on it&s;elf, by endeavoring to prove, that the liberty and happine&s;s of America could &s;afely be entru&s;ted to tho&s;e who have <HI>&s;old their own,</HI> unawed by the &s;en&s;e of virtue or of &s;hame.</P>
<P>"TREATED with the contempt which &s;uch conduct de&s;erved, they have applied to individuals: They have &s;olicited them to break the bonds of allegiance, and imbue their &s;ouls with the blacke&s;t of crimes: But, fearing that none could be found through the&s;e United States equal to the wickedne&s;s of their purpo&s;e, to influence weak minds, they have threatened more wide deva&s;tation.</P>
<P>"WHILE the &s;hadow of hope remained, that our enemies could be taught by our example to re&s;pect tho&s;e laws which are held &s;acred among civilized nations, and to comply with the dictates of a religion which they pretend in common with us to believe and to revere, they have been left to the influence of that religion and that example. But &s;ince their incorrigible di&s;po&s;itions cannot be touched by kindne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, it becomes our duty by other means to vindicate the rights of humanity.</P>
<P>"WE, therefore, the Congre&s;s of the United States of America, do &s;olemnly declare and proclaim, that if our enemies pre&s;ume to execute their threats, or per&s;i&s;t in their pre&s;ent career of barbarity, we will take &s;uch exemplary vengeance as &s;hall deter others from a like conduct. We appeal to that God who &s;earcheth the hearts of men, for the rectitude of our intentions; and in his holy pre&s;ence we declare, that as we are not moved by any light and ha&s;ty &s;ugge&s;tions of anger or revenge, &s;o through every

<P>THUS all negotiation for dependence being at an end, Great-Britain and America are now to contend on the following points: 1&s;t. On the part of Great-Britain it is declared, that as we <HI>will not</HI> &s;ubmit, and &s;he <HI>cannot</HI> &s;ubdue, &s;he will attempt to ruin and de&s;troy. 2dly. On the part of America it is declared, that if the war is pro&s;ecuted in a manner not conformable to the laws of nations, the con|duct of her enemies &s;hall be retaliated.</P>
<P>IF our enemies were under the guidance of rea&s;on, they would de&s;i&s;t from tho&s;e efforts with which they threaten us; 1&s;t. Becau&s;e, although they may burn many defence|le&s;s towns, and ravage much of the open country, the at|tempt to ruin us mu&s;t be un&s;ucce&s;sful, and the expence of it enormous; not to mention that their whole force is nece&s;&s;ary for their own defence, which nece&s;&s;ity will daily increa&s;e. 2dly. Becau&s;e their barbarity, by exa&s;perating more the minds of the Americans, will more effectually wean them from all attachment to, and connection with, Great-Britain, as well political as commercial. 3dly. Be|cau&s;e they mu&s;t expect that our allies will afford every aid in their power to vindicate the violated rights of nations; which indeed they are bound to do, not only in common with all other &s;overeigns, but by the powerful principles of faith and affection. And 4thly. Becau&s;e &s;uch conduct on their part would ju&s;tify on ours not only the breach of any compacts which might be entered into, but even the mo&s;t &s;anguinary mea&s;ures at the mo&s;t di&s;tant period; nay more, would demand a remembrance of the injury, until &s;uch ample vengeance would be taken as would in future pre|vent &s;imilar in&s;ults from others.</P>
<P>BUT the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the&s;e mea&s;ures is very far
<PB N="121" REF="016625_0122_0F9D708C69FC4698">
from being a conclu&s;ive argument why they will not adopt them; 1&s;t. Becau&s;e their whole conduct, with re|lation to this country, bears &s;uch &s;trong marks of folly, that to &s;uppo&s;e they will not ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in it, would argue a degree of weakne&s;s and infidelity. 2dly. Becau&s;e it is perhaps nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould make a vi&s;itation to every &s;tate, in order to purge it of the mo&s;t turbulent part of the di&s;affected, and puni&s;h the remainder by the de&s;truction of their property, thereby bringing home to their feelings that conviction which was not to be effected in the common way of rea&s;oning. 3dly. Be|cau&s;e &s;omething mu&s;t be allowed to the angui&s;h of di&s;|appointed avarice and ambition; for, &s;ince no hope re|mains of acquiring that dominion which was the object of their fervent de&s;ires, it is perfectly natural that men, free from the influence of ju&s;tice o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> humanity, &s;hould take any and every method to &s;atiate the vengeance of defeated de&s;poti&s;m. And 4thly. Becau&s;e, as they &s;uppo&s;e, they have offended us beyond forgivene&s;s; &s;o they con|clude that we &s;hall be &s;timulated by pa&s;&s;ions like their own, to pro&s;ecute their ruin: In which ca&s;e, being too haughty to a&s;k our friend&s;hip, they have no alternative but to endeavor to render our enmity as little dangerous as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the determination of America to retaliate, is dictated by every motive of policy and ju&s;tice, and mu&s;t terminate to the great prejudice of Britain, and the ruin of her adherents on this &s;ide of the Atlantic: Nor can the means be wanting; the towns on her coa&s;t are at lea&s;t as defencele&s;s as ours; and their citizens, un|u&s;ed to arms, are utterly incapable of repelling an a&s;&s;ault. A &s;mall &s;um of money would wrap their metropolis in flames. Their &s;ubjects and adherents may ea&s;ily be found in any part of the earth; and the dreaded &s;calping-knife it&s;elf may, in the hands of our riflemen, &s;pread horror through their i&s;land. The&s;e and many other methods may readily be devi&s;ed; and certainly &s;ome critical mo|ment will offer it&s;elf in the flow of time to proclaim to them the injuries of America in the rough &s;ounds of merited barbarity.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="016625_0123_0F9D708D2FC1D868">CONSIDERING our pre&s;ent &s;ituation and connections, we cannot but be &s;en&s;ible that the independence of Ame|rica is fully &s;ecured, and nothing left to guard again&s;t but the ravages of a cruel foe, and the derangement of our finances. To effect the former, we mu&s;t hold our&s;elves ready to repel force by force wherever a&s;&s;ailed, and firmly retort every infringement of the law of nations with un|feeling per&s;everance. To remedy the latter, oeconomy in the expenditure of money, and taxation, are the natural means, and, in addition to the&s;e, private oeconomy, founded on a conviction that the monies wantonly expended in the pre&s;ent moment of depreciation, will &s;oon be deeply regretted when it hath recovered its full value. By &s;uch &s;teps we &s;hall fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of our enemies, and ha&s;ten that moment when the United States of North-America, ri&s;ing from di&s;tre&s;s to glory, &s;hall di&s;pen&s;e to their citizens the ble&s;&s;ings of that peace, liberty and &s;afety for which we have virtuou&s;ly and vigorou&s;ly contended.</P>
<P>THE portals of the temple we have rai&s;ed to freedom, &s;hall then be thrown wide, as an a&s;ylum to mankind. America &s;hall receive to her bo&s;om and comfort and cheer the oppre&s;&s;ed, the mi&s;erable and the poor of every nation and of every clime. The enterpri&s;e of extending com|merce &s;hall wave her friendly flag over the billows of the remote&s;t regions. Indu&s;try &s;hall collect and bear to her &s;hores all the various productions of the earth, and all by which human life and human manners are poli&s;hed and adorned. In becoming acquainted with the religions, the cu&s;toms and the laws, the wi&s;dom, virtues and follies and prejudices of different countries, we &s;hall be taught to cheri&s;h the principles of general benevolence. We &s;hall learn to con&s;ider all men as our brethren, being equally children of the Univer&s;al Parent&mdash;that God of the heavens and of the earth, who&s;e infinite maje&s;ty, for pro|vidential favor during the late revolution, almighty power in our pre&s;ervation from impending ruin, and gracious mercy in our redemption from the iron &s;hackles of de|&s;poti&s;m, we cannot cea&s;e with gratitude and with deep humility to prai&s;e, to reverence and adore.</P>
