<HEAD>A FUNERAL ELOGIUM, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been the laudable practice of all ages, to perpetuate the memory of their illu&s;trious dead, either by erecting to their fame, monuments of the mo&s;t durable materials; or immortalizing their names, in the faithful pages of hi&s;tory. The&s;e methods, of expre&s;&s;ing our e&s;teem, are indeed of no avail to the decea&s;ed; but to be con&s;idered as grateful memorials of their &s;uperior merit; and to prevent time, which molders away their mortal part, from obliterating the remembrance of their
<PB N="2" REF="007933_0003_102E038B308AA2C0">virtues. They are, moreover, of &s;ingular u&s;e, to in&s;pire po&s;terity with an emulation of examples &s;o de&s;ervedly honoured, and tran&s;mitted to futurity with &s;uch eminent marks of di&s;tinction. Hence there is, perhaps, not a more u&s;eful &s;tudy than that of BIOGRAPHY, which pre&s;ents to our view the glorious patterns of antiquity; and while the amiable portraits are pa&s;&s;ing before our eyes, can &s;carcely fail of imprinting on our minds, &s;ome beautiful and &s;triking lineament. To &s;ee virtue and vice exemplified in real life, is in&s;tead of a thou&s;and lec|tures; and infu&s;es greater veneration and horror, than whole volumes of moral philo&s;ophy. And, when fi|nally, we con&s;ider, that all tho&s;e celebrated characters have long &s;ince &s;ubmitted to the inevitable &s;troke of fate, &s;uch a reflection will out-preach the preacher, and more effectually than the boy at PHILIP'S ear, re|mind us of our own mortality. But &s;hall heroes and conquerors, ingro&s;s the admiration of po&s;terity, while the chri&s;tian and the patriot, lie buried in oblivion? Shall the &s;plendor of martial renown, wholly extingui&s;h the mild&mdash;the gentle lu&s;tre of private worth? Is not the
<PB N="3" REF="007933_0004_102E038DB8B380C0">&s;age, the philo&s;opher, and the friend, who diffu&s;ed joy and happine&s;s all around him, as worthy the funeral eulogy, as tho&s;e victorious ravagers who &s;eatter famine and war; and owe the blaze of their glory to the terror of their arms?</P>
<P>To have all the qualifications that render a man amiable or great;&mdash;to be the object of delight wherever one is known;&mdash;to po&s;&s;e&s;s learning, genius, and &s;ubli|mity of &s;oul;&mdash;can there be born a greater ble&s;&s;ing to the world? To exert tho&s;e &s;hining endowments for the benefit of mankind, and employ a great and elevated &s;pirit, only in doing great and diffu&s;ive good.&mdash;Can a nobler u&s;e be made of the happie&s;t talents? Amid&s;t &s;uch &s;triking colours, in &s;o degenerate an age, who can mi&s;take the picture of the excellent decea&s;ed, who&s;e memory the&s;e pages are intended to celebrate?</P>
<P>CAN you image to your&s;elf, a per&s;on mode&s;t in pro&s;perity, prudent in difficulty, in bu&s;ine&s;s indefati|gable, magnanimous in danger, ea&s;y in his manners,
<PB N="4" REF="007933_0005_102E038FF0344D30">of exqui&s;ite judgment, of profound learning, catholic in &s;entiment, of the pure&s;t morals, and great even in the minute&s;t things.&mdash;Can you image &s;o accompli&s;hed a per&s;on, without recollecting the idea of the late PRESIDENT BURR?</P>
<P>WHETHER we con&s;ider him in a private, or public view, he is &s;till equally &s;triking, equally di&s;tingui&s;hed; and, without exaggerated expre&s;&s;ion, &s;omething &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing the ordinary bounds of human nature.</P>
<P>FEW were more perfect in the art of rendering them|&s;elves agreeable in company. 'Twas in tho&s;e &s;ocial mo|ments, when frequently the human mind lies all open and ungarded, that he blended improvement with delight; and happily tempered the &s;erious with the gay. His knowledge of men unfolded to him all the avenues to the heart, which he could variou&s;ly affect with wonderful dexterity. Nothing is more difficult, than to plea&s;e in conver&s;ation, without betraying a de&s;ign to plea&s;e, which never fails to di&s;gu&s;t. Pride
<PB N="5" REF="007933_0006_102E03918EA3CD80">cannot bear to be diverted by a companion, who, under the di&s;gui&s;e of entertaining others, appears intent on &s;ecuring his own applau&s;e. Hence good nature and mode&s;ty, with a &s;lender &s;hare of ingenuity and reading, generally carry the palm again&s;t wit and erudition, attended with o&s;tentation and parade. Of this &s;o &s;en&s;ible was the PRESIDENT, that unle&s;s the &s;ubject required it, no one would have &s;u&s;pected his learn|ing; and when it did, every one was a&s;toni&s;hed how a perion &s;o immer&s;ed in books, had acquired &s;o large a &s;hare of ea&s;e in conver&s;e, and freedom of behaviour. But in him every thing was agreeable, becau&s;e every thing was natural: and he had the &s;ecret to be inti|mately familiar, without degrading the dignity of his function. As he had not &s;tudied the philo&s;ophers, without &s;acrificing to the graces; &s;o neither in the &s;allies of humour, did he ever forget the character of a DIVINE. In a word, his open benevolent and un|di&s;&s;embling heart, in&s;pired all around him with innocent chearfulne&s;s; and made every one who knew him, court his engaging &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007933_0007_102E0394004C4B40">
IN his FRIENDSHIPS how varm! how &s;incere! how refined and di&s;intere&s;ted! Power, with her mighty arm, may extort a reluctant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: Wealth, with her golden lure, may attract the ob&s;equi|ous lev&eacute;e: Honour, with its &s;urrounding blaze, may dazzle the wondering multitude: And eloquence, with her enchanting voice, bewitch the tran&s;ported audience. But neither power, with her mighty arm; nor wealth, with her golden lure; nor honour, with its &s;urrounding blaze; nor eloquence with her inchant|ing voice, can fix a &s;ingle heart, or procure a cordial friend.</P>
<P>THO' a per&s;on of a &s;lender and delicate make, to encounter fatigue he had a heart of &s;teel; and for the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, the mo&s;t amazing talents, joined to a con&s;tancy of mind, that induced &s;ucce&s;s in &s;pite of every ob&s;tacle. As long as an enterprize appeared not ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, he knew no di&s;couragement; but in proportion to its difficulty, augmented his dili|gence: and by an in&s;uperable fortitude, frequently
<PB N="7" REF="007933_0008_102E0396472B5F78">accompli&s;hed, what his friends and acquaintance con|ceived utterly impracticable. To his unparallel'd a&s;&s;i|duity, next to the divine ble&s;&s;ing, is doubtle&s;s to be a&s;cribed the pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the COLLEGE of NEW-JERSEY; which, from a meer private under|taking, is in a few years, become the joy of its friends, and the admiration and envy of its enemies.</P>
<P>HE was life and activity it&s;elf; and tho' cut off in the bloom and vigour of his years, attained, with re&s;pect to his public utility, the remote&s;t period of old age. His every year was replete with good works; and while others cou'd here and there boa&s;t a &s;hining action, like a &s;cattered &s;tar in the va&s;t expan&s;e of heaven, his LIFE, like the milky way, was one continued univer&s;al glow.</P>
<P>IN the &s;acred &s;criptures, he was a perfect APOLLOS. The&s;e were his con&s;tant &s;tudy, the &s;ubject of his daily meditation: From the&s;e, he extracted his divinity: From the&s;e, the maxims of his conduct: and by the&s;e, was made wi&s;e unto &s;alvation.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007933_0009_102E03989BC738A8">
HIS PIETY eclip&s;ed all his other accompli&s;hments. He was &s;teady in his faith; unfluctuating in principle; ardent in devotion; deaf to temptation; open to the motions of grace; without pride; without oftentation; full of GOD; evacuated of &s;elf; having his conver&s;a|tion in heaven; &s;eeing thro' the veil of mortality, the high de&s;tiny of man; breathing a &s;piritual life; and offering up a perpetual holocau&s;t of adoration and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>I MENTION not his private CHARITY and ALMS. I &s;ay nothing of his PRAYERS, his FASTINGS and his WATCHINGS. I pa&s;s by all tho&s;e virtues, which &s;hunn'd applau&s;e, and &s;ought ob&s;curity and retirement. The&s;e were only to be ob&s;erved by that all-penetrating eye, which pervades immen&s;ity; and to be noticed by that omni&s;cient judge, who &s;eeth in &s;ecret, but will reward before the grand con&s;i&s;tory of angels and men.</P>
<P>HOWEVER &s;teady to his own principles, he was perfectly free from every appearance of BIGOTRY. He
<PB N="9" REF="007933_0010_102E039BC5E212B0">prized religion as an ine&s;timable jewel, who&s;e real va|lue was neither inhanced nor dimini&s;hed by the ca&s;ket in which it is depo&s;ited. Hence he loved and revered the &s;incere and exemplary of every communion; and particularly cultivated a &s;trict corre&s;pondence, with &s;everal of the greate&s;t ornaments of the CHURCH e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in ENGLAND; who, in their turn, treated him with the highe&s;t affection and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>IN the PULPIT he &s;hone with &s;uperior lu&s;tre. He was fluent, copious, &s;ublime and per&s;ua&s;ive. The momentous truths, and awful my&s;teries of religion, &s;o &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his mind, that he &s;poke from the heart, which is the only way of &s;peaking to it. His language was intelligible to the meane&s;t capacity; and above the cen&s;ure of the greate&s;t genius. He was neither de&s;titute of the ornaments of &s;tile; nor &s;o capti|vated with the flowers of rhetoric, as to bury beneath them, the fruits of improvement. More &s;ollicitous to penetrate the heart, than to amu&s;e the head, he aimed at per&s;picuity; and in&s;tead of &s;ubtle &s;peculations and
<PB N="10" REF="007933_0011_102E039E9F38D7F8">metaphy&s;ical di&s;tinctions, inculcated the luminous and uncontroverted truths of revelation. His invention was not &s;o properly fruitful, as inexhau&s;tible; and his elocution equal to his ideas. Out of the well-&s;tor'd trea&s;ure of his mind, he produced things new and old; while his human literature, like an ob&s;equious handmaid, was ever ready to &s;et off and embelli&s;h her mi&s;tre&s;s DIVINITY. He was none of tho&s;e "downy doctors," who &s;ooth their hearers into delu&s;ive hopes of the divine acceptance; or &s;ub&s;titute external morality, in the room of vital godline&s;s: On the contrary, he &s;corned to proclaim the peace of GOD, 'till the rebel laid down his arms, and returned to his allegiance. He was an amba&s;&s;ador, that adhered inviolably to his in&s;tructions; nor ever acceded to a treaty, that would not be ratified in the court of heaven. He &s;earched the con&s;cience with the terrors of the law, before he e&s;&s;uaged its angui&s;h with the balm of Gilead, or pre|&s;cribed the &s;weet emollients of a bleeding deity. He acted, in &s;hort, like one not intru&s;ted with the lives and fortunes, but the everla&s;ting intere&s;ts of his fellow|mortals;
<PB N="11" REF="007933_0012_102E03A0F8CDB7B0">and therefore made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to advance the divine life, and re&s;tore the beautiful image of GOD, disfigured by the apo&s;tacy of man&mdash;to repre&s;ent religion as the offspring of light, and the parent of liberty and &s;elf-dominion;&mdash;to expo&s;e the &s;hadowy gratificati|ons of pomp and power, and recommend the &s;uperior exalted plea&s;ures of a con&s;tant intercour&s;e with the fa|ther of &s;pirits, the fountain of life, and light and love;&mdash; to call our wandering thoughts from the &s;yren allure|ments of the world and the fle&s;h, and direct them to the &s;upreme magnet of &s;ouls, the center and origin of beatitude and perfection;&mdash;to enlighten the under|&s;tanding; to reform the judgment; to regulate the pa&s;&s;ions, and to rectify the will.</P>
<P>WHAT he preached in the pulpit, he lived out of it. His LIFE and EXAMPLE were a comment on his &s;ermons: and by his engaging deportment, he rendered the amiable character of a chri&s;tian &s;till more attrac|tive and lovely. In many, religion appears awkward and di&s;gu&s;tful: In &s;ome, more agreeable and becom|ing; in others, charming and ornamental; but in him
<PB N="12" REF="007933_0013_102E03A424F5CAC0">&s;he &s;eemed to have erected her throne, and as it were doubled the beams of her maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE PASTORAL FUNCTION he di&s;charged with equal fidelity and &s;ucce&s;s. To examine into the condition of his flock;&mdash;to watch again&s;t e&s;&s;ential errors;&mdash;to in&s;truct the ignorant;&mdash;to revive the di&s;con&s;olate;&mdash;to animate the penitent;&mdash;to reclaim the relap&s;ing;&mdash;to confirm the irre&s;olute;&mdash;to humble the arrogant, and reprove the contumacious and immoral, were his con|&s;tant and mo&s;t delightful employments.</P>
<P>FOR PUBLICK SPIRIT, and the love of his country, who ever &s;urpa&s;&s;ed this reverend patriot? Amid&s;t all the cares of his academical function, he thought, and &s;tudied, and plan'd, and toil'd, for the common weal. He had a high &s;en&s;e of engli&s;h liberty; and dete&s;ted de&s;potic power, as the bane of human happine&s;s. With him the here&s;y of ARIUS was not more fatal to the purity of the go&s;pel, than the po&s;itions of FILMAR, to the dignity of man, or the repo&s;e of &s;tates. Of our excellent con&s;titution he entertained the
<PB N="13" REF="007933_0014_102E03A5C33CF2F0">ju&s;te&s;t idea; and gloried in the privileges of a Briton, as much as he lamented their pro&s;titution and abu&s;e. If any thing ever ruffled the &s;erenity of his mind, be|&s;ides the prevalence of vice, it was the adver&s;e fortune and di&s;a&s;trous &s;ituation of his country. His compa&s;|&s;ionate bo&s;om daily agonized, for the families bleeding by the &s;word of the wilderne&s;s; or captivated by ruthle&s;s unrelenting &s;avages. His MAJESTY'S arms un|&s;ucce&s;sful, and tho&s;e of the enemy victorious, fired him with a generous re&s;entment; and made him rou&s;e his fellow-&s;ubjects, to efface the memory of our former mi&s;carriage; and avenge the righteous quarrel of the BEST OF KINGS. How did he lament, that BRITAIN, the mother of heroes, the &s;chool of patriots and war|riors, the land of frugality and virtue, the native &s;oil of liberty, that light of life and &s;ource of human bli&s;s! &mdash;that BRITAIN, which humbled the oppre&s;&s;ors of the earth; and bade her navies carry her name in terror round the world, &s;hould at length degenerate into the &s;hameful &s;eat of venality and corruption; become the nur&s;e of effeminacy, voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, and riot; the vile
<PB N="14" REF="007933_0015_102E03A9F2D80590">receptacle of impurity, &s;loth and dejection; and &s;o ignominiou&s;ly forget her primitive martial prowe&s;s, as to brook the in&s;ults of a people, formerly trembling at her name; and for every indignity, feeling the ven|geance of her arms!</P>
<P>IN propagating the go&s;pel among the heathen natives, how a&s;&s;iduous a CORRESPONDENT of the SCOTCH SO|SIETY! He thought no labour, no difficulty too great, in the pro&s;ecution of &s;o important an enterprize. An enterprize, mo&s;t benevolently calculated, to illumine the gloomy wilderne&s;s with the beams of evangelical truth; and proclaim the re&s;urrection and the life, to tho&s;e who &s;at in darkne&s;s and the &s;hadow of death! By the &s;miles of heaven, on the pious endeavours of that VENERABLE BODY; and the zealous activity of &s;ome of their mi&s;&s;ionaries, many are undoubtedly converted from pagani&s;m to chri&s;tianity; and from the error of their ways, to the LIVING GOD. How illu&s;trious an atchievement, to lead the wor&s;hippers of decea&s;ed heroes and infernal &s;pirits, to the knowledge of the
<PB N="15" REF="007933_0016_102E03AC39CCA180">UNIVERSAL CREATOR AND FATHER OF ALL! To transform rocks and mountains, till then the pagods of &s;uper&s;tition and polythei&s;m, into &s;o many Bethels to the LORD OF HOSTS!&mdash;To render the howling de&s;art, hitherto re&s;ounding with idolatrous orgies, divinely vocal with the prai&s;es of GOD, and his anoin|ted MESSIAH! &mdash;To prepare, in fine, the obdurate heart of barbari&s;m for the influences of the HOLY GHOST; and repleni&s;h the huts of &s;avages with the di&s;ciples of JESUS!</P>
<P>WITH what dignity and reputation, did he &s;u&s;tain the office of PRESIDENT! Sen&s;ible how important to the public, and thro' the whole thread of our exi&s;tence, is the early culture of the human mind, he con&s;idered him&s;elf, with the painter of old, as "de&s;igning for eter|nity". He had the mo&s;t engaging method of in&s;truc|tion; nor inferior to the extent of his capacity, was his facility in communicating. No man had a happier talent of expre&s;&s;ing his &s;entiments; or calling latent truth from her dark and profound rece&s;&s;es. No man
<PB N="16" REF="007933_0017_102E03AE87B8F1A8">more capable of opening the mental &s;oil, to the kindly rays of &s;cience; or improving its fertility, with the gentle dews of expo&s;ition and comment. In&s;tead of turning any branch of learning, into inexplicable my&s;|tery, the common pride of pedagogues, he &s;et the mo&s;t intricate points in the cleare&s;t light, and &s;tripp'd off all the &s;chola&s;tic clouds, that ob&s;cured the &s;imple maje&s;ty of knowledge.</P>
<P>NOR did he neglect any opportunity of imbuing the minds of his PUPILS with the &s;eeds of VIRTUE, at the &s;ame time that he inriched them, with the trea&s;ures of learning. And, indeed, if a pagan mythologi&s;t could ob&s;erve, that to treat of the world, without &s;aying any thing of its author, would be impious, what wonder that this divine philo&s;opher, in explain|ing the appearances of the univer&s;e, &s;hould trace the bright and con&s;picuous foot&s;teps of the deity, thro' every part of the magnificent &s;y&s;tem of nature! What wonder, that he perpetually rai&s;ed their thoughts, to the invi&s;ible things of GOD, from the vi&s;ible wonders
<PB N="17" REF="007933_0018_102E03B01FF0ECF8">of his power; from the beautiful and &s;tupendous fabric of the world, to the infinite all-governing ARCHITECT; and from the &s;catter'd rays to the IMMENSE OCEAN OF LIGHT!</P>
<P>WITH the &s;ame ea&s;e, he &s;ecured the obedience and the love of the &s;tudents. He had the art of leading the will by invi&s;ible chains; and <Q>making rea&s;on, no le&s;s prevalent than authority.</Q> Who, like him, could puni&s;h an offence, not only without the re&s;entment, but with the approbation of the delinquent? Speak ye, who be&s;t can tell, ye &s;ons of the prophets, who experienced his affection; nor ever heard him pronounce puni&s;hment, without ob&s;erving the trickling tear, and the reluctant heart? Surely, never will his idea be blotted from your memories; but in your walks, in your &s;tudies, in your meditations and amu&s;ements, you will &s;ee him, hear him, acco&s;t him, admire and deplore him.&mdash; With him, doubtle&s;s, had the MUSES de&s;erted their recent abode; and SCIENCE ru&s;ted in her inexplicated volumes, had not the &s;ame all-gracious hand, which
<PB N="18" REF="007933_0019_102E03B26B2E0808">removed one pre&s;ident, in&s;tantly pointed out another: Perhaps the only one, capable of making us forget (could &s;uch a calamity be ever forgotten) the lo&s;s of his predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>WHATEVER di&s;gui&s;e the hypocrite may a&s;&s;ume, at the approach of death, di&s;&s;imulation drops her ma&s;t. When men have but a moment to live, it is no longer their intere&s;t to wear a vizard. In this preci&s;e view, let us therefore contemplate our illu&s;trious friend. Than a DYING CHRISTIAN, the whole compa&s;s of nature affords not an object of more dignity, a&s;toni&s;h|ment or grandeur. Come, ye mini&s;ters of the LORD, behold a &s;pectacle, even to you, of fruitful in&s;truction. Behold the triumphs of grace, in the di&s;&s;olution of na|ture! What patience, what re&s;ignation, what lively hope and divine affiance! See the king of terrors di&s;|arm'd of his &s;ting; and vanqui&s;h'd in the very act of conquering! Behold heaven commencing on earth; and faith triumphant over pain, di&s;ea&s;e, and mortality! Wrapt in the thoughts of immortal life, he appears
<PB N="19" REF="007933_0020_102E03B6F9298B80">great even in the mid&s;t of di&s;tre&s;s; and &s;uffers with all the maje&s;ty of woe. How augu&s;t in ruin! How immoveably fixt on the rock of ages! What peace pa&s;&s;ing under&s;tanding! What joy, what ineffable joy, in the HOLY GHOST! <Q>O death, where is thy &s;ting? O grave, where is thy victory?</Q></P>
<P>BUT what heart can conceive, what tongue can utter the angui&s;h of his CONSORT? Alas! madam, that &s;o bright a &s;un &s;hou'd decline &s;o &s;oon; and with it, your every joy and every comfort! An awful le&s;|&s;on, again&s;t building our happine&s;s, except on the foundation of eternity. But why the unavailing tear, or fruitle&s;s lamentation? He is indeed a pri&s;oner to the grave, but he is a pri&s;oner of hope. Since the omnipotent captain of his &s;alvation has &s;ubdued the la&s;t enemy, di&s;poiled principalities and powers, and led captivity captive, the bla&s;ts of death cannot de&s;troy the buds of his virtue. The&s;e are tran&s;ported to the paradi&s;e of GOD, there to grow, and &s;pread, and flouri&s;h, with unwithering and ever-blooming verdure.
<PB N="20" REF="007933_0021_102E03B89448C790">'Tis death alone, that affords a harbour, to all that embark on the &s;ea of this tempe&s;tuous life. But with him, the &s;torms that vex this turbulent ocean are blown over, and will mole&s;t no more. He has fini&s;hed the perillous voyage, and enjoys a &s;ecure anchorage in the calm haven of eternal re&s;t. He is where even you, madam, could not improve his happine&s;s. He is&mdash; and what a cruel kindne&s;s to regret his lot!&mdash;he is <Q>re|moved from all pain, re&s;olv'd of all doubt, purified from all &s;in, delivered from all fear,</Q> and happy be|yond hope, or the power of time and vici&s;&s;itude. Cea&s;e then to weep an angel, whom you lov'd a man. Ra|ther improve the alarming providence, and take &s;anc|tuary in the con&s;olations of religion; and then, 'tis the voice of infallibility, "thy maker will be thy hu&s;band." Thus will in&s;truction &s;pring from his very relicks; and wi&s;dom, the be&s;t of wi&s;dom, blo&s;&s;om on his &s;epulchre.</P>
<P>BUT what an unexpected &s;troke, and how univer|&s;ally deplored! See, how the churches put on their &s;ables, and mourn like a di&s;con&s;olate widow! Where
<PB N="21" REF="007933_0022_102E03BB065EE7B8">is the un&s;iowing eye, or the un&s;orrowing brea&s;t? O ad|mirable man! friend! father! hu&s;band! &s;cholar and di|vine! and worthy a longer life, was the pre&s;ent life of any other value, than to ripen us for the next. But <Q>great and marvellous are thy works, LORD GOD AL|MIGHTY! ju&s;t and true are thy ways, thou KING of SAINTS.</Q> At &s;o dreadful a blow, and &s;o glorious a change, who can weep, or who refrain from weeping? But will they not be guilty tears, that bemoan the ble&s;t tran&s;ition, from this vale of humiliation and &s;orrow, to the &s;ummit of immarce&s;&s;ible honour and joy? We may indeed lament our&s;elves, our country, and mankind, as bere&s;t of a friend; and the church of her ornament and boa&s;t: But we &s;hould rejoice, that he has bequeath|ed us the ine&s;timable legacy of his virtues; and that, "ble&s;&s;ed are the dead who die in the LORD." In&s;tead of effeminate wailings, let us therefore adorn his memory, by adopting his excellencies; and while nature drops the inevitable tear, let rea&s;on and religion crown his tomb with triumphant laurels.</P>
