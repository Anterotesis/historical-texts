<HEAD>POLITICAL OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>A VARIETY of publications in pamphlets and other forms, have appeared in different parts of the union, &s;ince the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s which ended in June, 1794; endeavoring, by di&s;coulored repre&s;entations of our public affairs, and particularly of certain occurrences of that &s;e&s;|&s;ion, to turn the tide of public opinion into a party chan|nel. The immediate object of the writers, was either avowedly or evidently to operate on the approaching electi|ons of Federal Repre&s;entatives. As that cri&s;is will have en|tirely elap&s;ed, before the following ob&s;ervations will appear; they will, at lea&s;t, be free from a charge of the &s;ame views; and will, con&s;equently, have the &s;tronger claim to that de|liberate attention and reflection to which they are &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>The publications alluded to, have pa&s;&s;ed &s;lightly over the tran&s;actions of the Fir&s;t and Second Congre&s;s; and &s;o far, their example will here be followed.</P>
<P>Whether, indeed, the funding &s;y&s;tem was modelled, ei|ther on the principles of &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice, or on the de|mands of public faith? Whether it did not contain ingredi|ents friendly to the duration of the public debt, and imply|ing that it was regarded as a public good? Whether the a&s;|&s;umption of the &s;tate debts was not enforced by overcharged repre&s;entations; and Whether, if the burdens had been equalized only, in&s;tead of being a&s;&s;umed in the gro&s;s, the &s;tates could not have di&s;charged their re&s;pective proportions, by their local re&s;ources, &s;ooner and more conveniently, than the general government will be able to di&s;charge the whole debts, by general re&s;ources? Whether the exci&s;e &s;y&s;tem, be congenial with the &s;pirit, and conducive to the happine&s;s of our country; or can even ju&s;tify it&s;elf as a productive &s;ource of Revenue? Whether again the bank was not e&s;tabli&s;hed without authority from the con&s;titution? Whether it did not throw unnece&s;&s;ary and unrea&s;onable advantages into the hands of men; previou&s;ly enriched beyond rea&s;on or ne|ce&s;&s;ity:
<PB N="2" REF="029017_0002_0FDE960D6B4E8470">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>According to the plan of the bank, originally recommended, in the report of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, the charter was to continue until the final redemption of that part of its &s;tock, con&s;i&s;t|ing of public debt; that is until the whole of the &s;ix percent &s;tock &s;hould be redeemed, for the part held by the bank could not be finally re|deemed until the final redemption of the entire ma&s;s. In the pro|gre&s;s of the bill through Congre&s;s, the term, not without difficul|ty (as it appears) was fixed at about twenty years. Notwith&s;tand|ing this reduction, the market value of bank &s;tock, has given an average profit to the &s;ub&s;cribers of thirty or forty per cent on their capitals; or an aggregate profit of three, on the aggregate capital of eight millions; and it could not otherwi&s;e happen, than that this immen&s;e gain, would fall into the hands of tho&s;e, who had gain|ed mo&s;t by purcha&s;es of certificates, becau&s;e the great purcha&s;ers being mo&s;t on the watch, having the be&s;t intelligence, and in ge|neral actually attended in per&s;on, or by agents on the operations of the government, would of cour&s;e, be the fir&s;t to &s;eize the proffer|ed advantage, in exclu&s;ion of the primitive, the di&s;tant, and the uninformed, if not mi&s;informed, holders of the &s;ub&s;cribable pa|per.</P><P> It has actually happened, that the fir&s;t provi&s;ion for redeeming the debt, at the &s;tipulated rate, has been po&s;tponed for five years: and the provi&s;ion now made, if no interruption whatever &s;hould take place, will not effect the object within le&s;s than twenty-five or thirty years. It will not be difficult to compute the additional profit, which would have accrued to the &s;tockholders, had the ori|ginal plan been adopted. But there is another, and perhaps a more important view of the tendency of a plan making the durati|on of the charter, to depend on the duration of the public debt. It would have &s;timulated, by the &s;tronge&s;t motive of intere&s;t, that important and influential corporation, to impede the final di&s;charge of the public debt, in order to prolong its charter and its emolu|ments. At pre&s;ent indeed it has but too obvious a temptation to favor the continuance and increa&s;e of public debts; &s;ince new debts call for anticipations by loans of its paper; and produce new taxes, by which the circulation of its paper is extended.</P><P> Tho&s;e who attended to this &s;ubject, with minds clouded, neither by prejudice nor by intere&s;t, will rightly decide on the union which has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between a &s;eat in Congre&s;s and a &s;eat at the bank.&mdash; The indecorum as well as evil tendency of the alliance, has, by provoking the cen&s;orial notice of the public, produced a tempora|ry di&s;&s;olution of it. Query, whether there be not a remnant of the abu&s;e, in the ca&s;e of &s;uch as are at the &s;ame time &s;tockholders of the bank and members of Congre&s;s? In the latter character, they vote for borrowing money on public account, which in their former character they are to lend on their own account.</P></NOTE> And whether it can be allowed the prai&s;e of a &s;a|lutary operation, until its effects &s;hall have been more accu|rately traced, and its hidden tran&s;actions &s;hall be fully un|veiled to the public eye. The&s;e and others are que&s;tions, which, though of great importance, it is not intended here
<PB N="3" REF="029017_0003_0FDE960FAD6D70B8">
to examine. Mo&s;t of them have been finally decided by the competent authority; and the re&s;t have, no doubt, already impre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves on the public attention.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing on then to the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s preceding the la&s;t, we are met in the fir&s;t place, by the mo&s;t &s;erious char|ges again&s;t the &s;outhern members of Congre&s;s in general, and particularly again&s;t the repre&s;entatives of Virginia.&mdash; They are charged with having &s;upported a policy which would inevitably have involved the United States in the war of Europe, have reduced us from the rank of a free peo|ple, to that of French colonies, and po&s;&s;ibly have landed us in di&s;union, anarchy, and mi&s;ery; and the policy, from which the&s;e tremendous calamities was to flow, is referred to certain commercial re&s;olutions moved by a member from Virginia, in the hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>To place in its true light, the fallacy which infers &s;uch con&s;equences from &s;uch a cau&s;e, it will be proper to review the circum&s;tances which preceeded and attended the rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It is well known, that at the peace between the United States and Great Britain, it became a que&s;tion with the lat|ter, whether &s;he &s;hould endeavor to regain the lo&s;t commerce of America, by liberal and reciprocal arrangements; or tru&s;t to a relap&s;e of it, into its former channels, without the price of &s;uch arrangements on her part. Whil&s;t &s;he was fearful that our commerce would be conducted into new and rival channels, &s;he leaned to the fir&s;t &s;ide of the alternative, and a bill was actually carried in the Hou&s;e of Commons, by the pre&s;ent Prime Mini&s;ter corre&s;ponding with that &s;en|timent. She &s;oon, however, began to di&s;cover (or to hope) that the weakne&s;s of our Federal Government, and the want of concurrence among the &s;tate governments would &s;ecure her again&s;t the danger at fir&s;t apprehended. From that moment all ideas of conciliation and conce&s;&s;ion vani&s;hed. She de|termined to enjoy at once the full benefit of the freedom al|lowed by our regulations, and of the monopolies, e&s;tabli&s;hed by her own.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of things, the pride, as well as the intere&s;t of America were every where arou&s;ed. The mercantile world in particular, was all on fire, complaints flew from one end of the continent to the other, projects of retaliation and re|dre&s;s, engro&s;&s;ed the public attention. At one time, the &s;tates endeavored by &s;eparate efforts, to counteract the une|qual laws of Great Britain. At another, corre&s;pondencies were opened fox uniting their efforts. An attempt was al&s;o
<PB N="4" REF="029017_0004_0FDE9611338D72E0">
made, to ve&s;t in the former Congre&s;s, a limited power for a limited time, in order to give effect to the general will.</P>
<P>All the&s;e experiments, in&s;tead of an&s;wering the purpo&s;e in view, &s;erved only to confirm Great Britain in her fir&s;t be|lief that her re&s;trictive plans, were in no danger of retalia|tion.</P>
<P>It was at length determined by the Legi&s;lature of Virgi|nia to go to work in a new way. It was propo&s;ed, and mo&s;t of the &s;tates agreed, to &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners to dige&s;t &s;ome change in our general &s;y&s;tem, that might prove an ef|fectual remedy. The Commi&s;&s;ioners met; but finding their powers too circum&s;cribed for the great object, which expanded it&s;elf before them, they propo&s;ed a convention on a more enlarged plan, for a general revi&s;ion of the Federal Government.</P>
<P>From this convention proceeded the pre&s;ent Federal Con|&s;titution, which gives to the general will, the means of pro|viding in the &s;everal nece&s;&s;ary ca&s;es, for the general welfare; and particularly in the ca&s;e of regulating our commerce in &s;uch manner as may be required by the regulations of other countries.</P>
<P>It was natural to expect, that one of the fir&s;t objects of de|liberation under the new con&s;titution, would be that which had been fir&s;t, and mo&s;t contemplated in forming it. Ac|cordingly it was at the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion propo&s;ed that &s;omething &s;hould be done analagous to the wi&s;hes of the &s;everal &s;tates, and expre&s;&s;ive of the efficiency of the new government. A di&s;crimination between nations in treaty, and tho&s;e not in treaty, the mode mo&s;t generally embraced by the &s;tates, was agreed to in &s;everal forms, and adhered to in repeated votes, by a very great majority of the hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. The Senate, however, did not concur with the hou&s;e of re|pre&s;entatives, and our commercial arrangements were made up without any provi&s;ion on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>From that date to the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s ending in June, 1794, the interval pa&s;&s;ed without any effective appeal to the intere&s;t of Great Britain. A &s;ilent reliance was placed on her voluntary ju&s;tice, or her enlightened intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The long and patient reliance being a&s;cribed (as was fore|told) to other cau&s;es, than a generous forbearance on the part of the United States, had, at the commencement of the third Congre&s;s, left us with re&s;pect to a reciprocity of commercial regulations between the two countries, preci&s;e|ly where the commencement of the fir&s;t Congre&s;s had found
<PB N="5" REF="029017_0005_0FDE9612BAC253F0">
us. This was not all, the we&s;tern po&s;ts, which entailed an expen&s;ive Indian war on us, continued to be withheld; although all pretext for it had been removed on our part. Depredations, as derogatory to our rights, as grievous to our intere&s;ts, had been evinced by the Briti&s;h Government again&s;t our lawful commerce on the high &s;eas. And it was believed, on the mo&s;t probable grounds, that the mea&s;ure by which the Algerine Pirates were let loo&s;e on the Atlantic, had not taken place without the participation of the &s;ame un|friendly coun&s;els. In a word, to &s;ay nothing of the Ameri|can victims to &s;avages and barbarians, it was e&s;timated that our annual damages from Great Britain, were not le&s;s than three or four millions of dollars.</P>
<P>This di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ituation &s;poke the more loudly to the pa|trioti&s;m of the Repre&s;entatives of the people, as the nature and manner of the communications from the Pre&s;ident, &s;eem|ed to make a formal and affecting appeal on the &s;ubject, to their co-operation. The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome effort was palpa|ble. The only room for different opinions &s;eemed to lie in the different modes of redre&s;s propo&s;ed. On one &s;ide no|thing was propo&s;ed, beyond the eventual mea&s;ures of defence, in which all concurred, except the building of &s;ix fri|gates, for the purpo&s;e of enforcing our rights again&s;t Algiers. The other &s;ide con&s;idering this mea&s;ure, as pointed at one only of our evils, and as inadequate even to that, thought it be&s;t to &s;eek for &s;ome &s;afe, but powerful remedy, that might be applied to the root of them; and with this view the Com|mercial Propo&s;itions were introduced.</P>
<P>They were at fir&s;t oppo&s;ed on the ground, that Great-Bri|tain was amicably di&s;po&s;ed towards the United States; and that we ought to await the event of the depending negociati|on. To this it was replied, that more than four years of appeal to that di&s;po&s;ition, had been tried in vain, by the new government, that the negociation had been abortive, and was no longer depending, that the late letters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his letter of 15th Augu&s;t, 1793, to the Secretary of State, in the printed communications from the Pre&s;ident to the Congre&s;s.</NOTE> from Mr. Pinckney, the mini&s;ter at London, had not only cut off all remaining hope from that &s;ource, but had expre&s;sly point|ed Commercial Regulations as the mo&s;t eligible redre&s;s to be pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Another ground of oppo&s;ition, was, that the United States
<PB N="6" REF="029017_0006_0FDE96171E2E41E0">
were more dependant on the trade of Great Britain, than Great Britain was on the trade of the United States. This will appear &s;carcely credible to tho&s;e who under&s;tand the commerce between the two countries, who recollect, that it &s;upplies us chiefly with &s;uper&s;luities, whil&s;t in return it em|ploys the indu&s;try of one part of her people, &s;ends to another part the very bread which keeps them from &s;tarving, and remits moreover, an annual balance in &s;pecie of ten or twelve millions of dollars. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This balance is not preci&s;e, but may be deemed within the amount. It appears from a late, and apparently an office &s;tatement from <HI>Great Britain</HI> of exports and imports between Great Britain and the United States, that the actual balance in the year 1791, was <HI>threemillions, thirty one thou&s;and two hundred and fifteen pounds, fourteen and nine pence &s;terl,</HI> and in the year 1792, <HI>three millions, two hundred and thirty one thou&s;and, and ninety pounds, &s;even &s;hillings and four pence&s;terl,</HI> equal to <HI>fourteen millions, three hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and, four hundred and one dollar.</HI> As this relates to the trade with Great Britain only, the balance in our favor in the We&s;t India trade is to be deducted. There is rea&s;on to believe, that it would not reduce the general balance &s;o low, as is above &s;tated; be&s;ides, that the balance again&s;t us, in the trade with Ireland, is not taken into the account.</NOTE> It is true, neverthele&s;s, as the debate &s;hews, that this was the language, however &s;trange, of &s;ome who combated the propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Nay, what is &s;till more extraordinary, it was maintained that the United States, had, on the whole, little or no rea&s;on to complain of the footing of their commerce with Great Britain; although &s;uch complaints had prevailed in every &s;tate, among every cla&s;s of citizens ever &s;ince the year 1783; and although the Federal Con&s;titution had originated in tho&s;e complaints, and had been e&s;tabli&s;hed with the known view of redre&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<P>As &s;uch objections could have little effect in convincing the judgement of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, and &s;till le&s;s that of the public at large; a new mode of a&s;&s;ailing the pro|po&s;itions has been &s;ub&s;tituted. The American People love peace; and the cry of war might alarm when no hope remained of convincingthem, the cry of war has accordingly been echo|ed through the continent with a loudne&s;s proportioned to the emptine&s;s of the pretext, and to this cry has been added, another &s;tile more ab&s;urd, that the propo&s;itions would in the end, en&s;lave the United States to their allies, and plunge them into anarchy and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>It is very mortifying to be obliged to tax the patience of
<PB N="7" REF="029017_0007_0FDE961C2855D228">
the reader, with an examination of &s;uch gro&s;s ab&s;urdities; but it may be of u&s;e to expo&s;e, where there be no nece&s;&s;ity to refu&s;e them.</P>
<P>What were the Commercial Propo&s;itions? They di&s;cri|minated between nations in treaty, and nations not in trea|ty, by an additional duty on the manufactures and trade of the latter; and they reciprocated the navigation laws of all nations, who excluded the ve&s;&s;els of the United States, from a common right of being u&s;ed in the trade between the Uni|ted States, and &s;uch nations.</P>
<P>Is there any thing here that could afford a cau&s;e, or a pre|text for war to Great Britain or any other nation? If we hold at pre&s;ent the rank of a free people; if we are no lon|ger colonies of Great Britain; if we have not already relap&s;ed into &s;ome dependence on that nation, we have the felt-evi|dent right, to regulate our trade according to our own will, and our own intere&s;t, not according to her will or her intere&s;t. This right can be denied to no independent nation. It has not been, and will not be denied to our&s;elves by any opponent of the propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>If the propo&s;itions could give no right to Great Britain to make war, would they have given any color to her for &s;uch an outrage on us? No American Citizen will affirm it. No Briti&s;h &s;ubject, who is a man of candor, will pretend it; becau&s;e he mu&s;t know, that the commercial regulations of Great Britain her&s;elf have di&s;criminated among foreign na|tions, whenever it was thought convenient. They have di&s;criminated again&s;t particular nations by name; they have di&s;criminated, with re&s;pect to particular articles by name, by the nations producing them, and by the places exporting them. And as to the navigation articles propo&s;ed, they were not only common to the other countries along with Great Britain; but reciprocal between Great Britain and the Uni|ted States: Nay, it is notorious, that they fell &s;hort of an immediate and exact reciprocity of her own Navigation Laws.</P>
<P>Would any nation be &s;o barefaced as to quarrel with ano|ther, for doing the &s;ame thing which &s;he her&s;elf has done, for doing le&s;s than &s;he her&s;elf has done, towards that parti|cular nation? It is impo&s;&s;ible that Great Britain would ever expo&s;e her&s;elf by &s;o ab&s;urd, as well as arrogant a proceed|ing. If the really meant to quarrel with this country, com|mon prudence, and common decency would pre&s;cribe &s;ome other le&s;s odious pretext for her ho&s;tility.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="029017_0008_0FDE961DADEAC6A8">
It is the more a&s;toni&s;hing that &s;uch a charge again&s;t the propo&s;itions &s;hould have been hazarded, when the opinion, and the proceedings, of America, on the &s;ubject of our own commercial policy is reviewed.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the power over trade, remained with the &s;everal States, there were few of them that did not exerci&s;e it, on the principle, if not in the mode of the commercial propo|&s;itions. The ea&s;tern States generally pa&s;&s;ed laws, either di&s;|criminating between &s;ome foreign nations and others, or levelled again&s;t Great Britain by name. Maryland and Vir|ginia did the &s;ame, &s;o did two, if not three, of the more &s;outhern States. Was it ever, during that period, pretend|ed at home or abroad, that a cau&s;e or pretext for quarrel, was given to Great Britain or any other nation? or were our rights better under&s;tood at that time, than at this, or more likely then, than now, to command the re&s;pect due to them.</P>
<P>Let it not be &s;aid, Great Britain was then at peace, &s;he is now at war. It &s;he would not wantonly attempt to con|troul the exerci&s;e of our &s;overeign rights, when &s;he had no other enemy on her hands, will &s;he be mad enough to make the attempt, when her hands are fully employed with the war already on them? Would not tho&s;e who &s;ay now, po&s;tpone the mea&s;ures until Great Britain &s;hall be at peace, be more ready, and have more rea&s;on to &s;ay in time of peace, po&s;tpone them until &s;he &s;hall be at war; there will then be no danger of her throwing new enemies into the &s;cale against her.</P>
<P>Nor let it be &s;aid, that the combined powers, would aid and &s;timulate Great Britain, to wage an unju&s;t war on the United States. They al&s;o are too fully occupied with their pre&s;ent enemy, to wi&s;h for another on their hands; not to add, that two of tho&s;e powers, being in treaty with the U|nited States, are favored by the propo&s;itions; and that all of them are well known to entertain an habitual jealou&s;y of the monopolizing character and maritime a&s;cendency of that nation.</P>
<P>One thing ought to be regarded as certain and conclu&s;ive on this head, whil&s;t the war again&s;t France remains un&s;uc|ce&s;sful, the United States are in no danger, from any of the powers engaged in it. In the event of a complete over|throw of that Republic, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, what might follow. But if the ho&s;tile views of the combination, &s;hould be turned towards this continent, it would clearly not be, to
<PB N="9" REF="029017_0009_0FDE961F34862AC0">
vindicate the commercial intere&s;ts of Great-Britain again&s;t the commercial rights of the United States. The object would be, to root out Liberty from the face of the earth. No pretext would be wanted, or a better would be contrived, than any thing to be found in the commercial propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>On whatever other &s;ide we view the clamor again&s;t the&s;e pro|po&s;itions, as inevitably productive of war, it pre&s;ents neither evidence to ju&s;tify it, nor argument to colour it.</P>
<P>The intellegation nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es, either that the friends of the plan could di&s;cover no probability, where its opponents could &s;ee a certainty, or that the former were le&s;s aver&s;e to war, than the latter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition will not be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. A few ob&s;erva|tions on the other may throw new lights on the whole &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>The members, in general, who e&s;pou&s;ed the&s;e propo&s;itions, have been con&s;tantly in that part of the Congre&s;s, who have pro&s;e&s;&s;ed with mo&s;t zeal, and pur&s;ued with mo&s;t &s;cruple, the characteri&s;tics of republican government. They have adhered to the&s;e characteri&s;tics in de&s;ining the meaning of the con&s;titu|tion, in adju&s;ting the ceremonial of public proccedings, and in making out the cour&s;e of the admini&s;tration. They have mani|fe&s;ted, particularly, a deep conviction of the danger to Liberty and the Con&s;titution, from a gradual a&s;&s;umption or exten&s;ion of di&s;cretionary powers in the executive departments; from &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive augmentions of a &s;tanding army; and from the perpetuity and progre&s;&s;ion of public debts and taxes. They have been &s;ometimes reprehended in debate for an exce&s;s of caution and jealou&s;y on the&s;e points. And the news-papers of a certain &s;tamp, by di&s;torting and di&s;colouring this part of their conduct, have painted it in all the deformity, which the mo&s;t indu&s;trious calumny could devi&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e be&s;t acquainted with the individuals who more parti|cularly &s;upported the propo&s;itions, will be foremo&s;t to te&s;tify, that &s;uch are the principles which not only govern them in pub|lic life, but which are invariably maintained by them in every other &s;ituation. And it cannot be believed, nor &s;u&s;pected, that with &s;uch principles they could view war as le&s;s an evil than it appeared to their opponents.</P>
<P>Of all the enemies to public liberty, war is, perhaps, the mo&s;t to be dreaded, becau&s;e it compri&s;es and developes the genius of every other. War is the parent of armies; from the&s;e proceed debts and taxes: and armies, and debts, and taxes are the known in&s;truments for bringing the many under the denomination of the few. In war, too, the di&s;cretionary power of the execu|tive is extended; its influence, in dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments, is multiplied; and all the means of &s;educing
<PB N="10" REF="029017_0010_0FDE9623432D2FC8">
the minds, are added to tho&s;e of &s;ubduing the force of the peo|ple. The &s;ame malignant a&s;pect in republicani&s;m, may be traced in the inequality of fortunes, and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a &s;tate of war, and in the degeneracy of man|ners and of morals, engendered by both. No nation could pre|&s;erve its freedom, in the mid&s;t of continual warfare.</P>
<P>Thu&s;e truths are well e&s;tabli&s;hed. They are read in every page which records the progre&s;&s;ion, from a le&s;s arbitrary to a more arbitrary government, or the tran&s;ition from a popular go|vernment, to an ari&s;tocracy or a monarchy.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be evident, then, that in the &s;ame degree as the friends of the propo&s;itions were jealous of armies, and debts, and pre|pogative, as dangerous to a republican con&s;titution; they mu&s;t have been aver&s;e to war, as favorable to armies, and debts, and prepogative.</P>
<P>The fact accordingly appears to be, that they were particular|ly aver&s;e to war. They not only con&s;idered the propo&s;itions as having no tendency to war, but preferred them, as the mo&s;t likely means of obtaining our objects without war. They thought, and thought truly, that Great-Britain was more vul|nerable in her commerce, than in her fleets and armies; that &s;he valued our nece&s;&s;aries for her markets, and our markets for her &s;uperfluities, more than &s;he feared our frigates or our militia; and that &s;he would, con&s;equently, be more ready to make pro|per conce&s;&s;ions under the influence of the former, than of the latter motive.</P>
<P>Great-Britain is a commercial nation. Her power, as well as her wealth, is derived from commerce. The American com|merce is the mo&s;t valuable branch &s;he enjoys. It is the more valuable, not only as being of vital importance to her in &s;ome re&s;pects, but of growing importance, beyond e&s;timate, in its general character. She will not ea&s;ily part with &s;uch a re&s;ource. She will not ra&s;hly hazard it. She would be particularly aware of forcing a perpetuiry of regulations, which not merely dimini&s;h her &s;hare, but may favor the rival&s;hip of other nations. If any thing, therefore, in the power of the United States, could over|come her pride, her avidity, and her repugnancy to this coun|try, it was ju&s;tly concluded to be, not the fear of our arms, which, though invincible in defence, are little formidable in a war of offence, but the fear of &s;uffering in the mo&s;t fruitful branch of her trade, and of &s;eeing it di&s;tributed among her rivals.</P>
<P>If any doubt on this &s;ubject could exi&s;t, it would vani&s;h on a recollection of the conduct of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try at the clo&s;e of the war in 1783. It is a fact which has been already touched, and is as notorious as it is in&s;tructive, that during the apprehen|&s;ion of finding her commerce with the United States abridged or
<PB N="11" REF="029017_0011_0FDE96285AA05C48">
endangered by the con&s;equences of the revelution, Great-Britain was ready to purcha&s;e it, even at the expence of her We&s;t-Indies monopoly. it was not until after &s;he began to perceive the weakne&s;s of the federal government, the di&s;cord in the coun|teracting plans of the &s;tate governments, and the intere&s;t &s;he would be able to e&s;tabli&s;h here, that &s;he ventured on that &s;y&s;tem to which &s;he has &s;ince inflexibly adhered. Had the pre&s;ent fe|deral government, on its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, done what it ought to have done, what it was in&s;tituted for, and expected to do, and what was actually propo&s;ed and intended it &s;hould do; had it revived and confirmed the belief in Great-Britain, that our trade and navigation would not be free to her without an equal and reciprocal freedom to us, in her trade and navigation, we have her own authority for &s;aying, that &s;he would long &s;ince have met us on proper ground; becau&s;e the &s;ame motives which pro|duced the bill brought into the Briti&s;h parliament by Mr. Pitt, in order to prevent the evil apprehended, would have produced the &s;ame conce&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t in order to obtain a recall of the evil, after it had taken place.</P>
<P>The aver&s;ion to war in the friends of the propo&s;itions, may be traced through the whole proceedings and debates of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. After the depredations in the We&s;t-Indies, which &s;eemed to fill up the mea&s;ure of Briti&s;h aggre&s;&s;ions, they adhered to their origi|nal policy of pur&s;uing redre&s;s, rather by commercial, than by ho&s;tile operations; and with this view unanimou&s;ly concurred in the bill for &s;u&s;pending importations from Briti&s;h ports; a bill that was carried through the hou&s;e by a vote of fifty-eight again&s;t thirty-four. The friends of the propo&s;itions appeared, indeed, never to have admitted, that Great-Britain could &s;eriou&s;ly mean to force a war with the United States, unle&s;s in the event of pro&s;trating the French Republic; and they did not believe that &s;uch an event was to be apprehended.</P>
<P>Con&s;iding in this opinion, to which Time has given its full fanction, they could not accede to tho&s;e extraordinary mea&s;ures, which nothing &s;hort of the mo&s;t obvious and imperious nece&s;&s;ity could plead for. They were as ready as any, to fortify our harbours, and fill our magazines and ar&s;enals; the&s;e were &s;afe and requi&s;ite provi&s;ions for our permanent defence. They were ready and anxious for arming and preparing our militia; that was the true republican bulwark of our &s;ecurity. They joined al&s;o in the addition of a regiment of artillery to the military e&s;tab|li&s;hment, in order to complete the defen&s;ive arrangement on our ea&s;tern frontier. The&s;e facts are on record, and are the proper an&s;wer to tho&s;e &s;hamele&s;s calumnies which have a&s;&s;erted, that the friends of the commercial propo&s;itions were enemies to every propo&s;ition for the national &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>But it was their opponents, not they, who continually main|tained, that on a failure of negociation, it would be more eligible
<PB N="12" REF="029017_0012_0FDE9629E00893A8">
to &s;eek redre&s;s by war, than by commercial regulations; who talked of rai&s;ing armies, that might threaten the neighbouring po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of foreign powers; who contended for delegating to the executive the prerogatives of deciding whether the country was at war or not, and of levying, organizing, and calling into the field, a regular army of ten, fifteen, nay, of TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND men.</P>
<P>It is of &s;ome importance that this part of the hi&s;tory of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, which has found no place in the late reviews of it, &s;hould be well under&s;tood. They who are curious to learn the parti|culars, mu&s;t examine the debates and the votes. A full narra|tive would exceed the limits which are here pre&s;cribed. It mu&s;t &s;uffice to remark, that the efforts were varied and repeated until the la&s;t moment of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, even after the departure of a number of members; forbade new propo&s;itions, much more a renewal of rejected ones; and that the powers propo&s;ed to be &s;urrendered to the executive, were tho&s;e which the con&s;titution has mo&s;t jealou&s;ly appropriated to the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>The reader &s;hall judge on this &s;ubject for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution expre&s;sly and exclu&s;ively ve&s;ts in the legi&s;li|ture the power of declaring a &s;tate of war: it was propo&s;ed, that the executive might, in the rece&s;s of the legi&s;lature, declare the United States to be in a &s;tate of war.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution expre&s;sly and exclu&s;ively ve&s;ts in the legi&s;la|ture the power of rai&s;ing armies: it was propo&s;ed, that in the rece&s;s of the legi&s;lature, the executive might, at its plea&s;ure, rai&s;e or not rai&s;e an army of ten, fifteen, or twenty-five thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution expre&s;sly and exclu&s;ively ve&s;ts in the legi&s;la|ture the power of creating offices: it was propo&s;ed, that the executive, in the rece&s;s of the legi&s;lature, might create offices, as well as appoint officers for an army of ten, fifteen, or twenty|five thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>A delegation of &s;uch powers would have &s;truck, not only at the fabric of our con&s;titution, but at the foundation of all well organized and well checked governments.</P>
<P>The &s;eparation of the power of declaring war, from that of conducting it, is wi&s;ely contrived, to exclude the danger of its being declared for the &s;ake of its being conducted.</P>
<P>The &s;eparation of the power of rai&s;ing armies, from the power of commanding them, is intended to prevent the rai&s;ing armies for the &s;ake of commanding them.</P>
<P>The &s;eparation of the power of creating offices, from that of filling them, is an e&s;&s;ential guard again&s;t the temptation to create offices, for the &s;ake of gratifying favorites, or multiplying de|pendants.</P>
<P>Where would be the difference between the blending the&s;e incompatible powers, by &s;urrendering the legi&s;lative part of them
<PB N="13" REF="029017_0013_0FDE962B673BABB0">
into the hands of the executive, and by a&s;&s;uming the executive part of them into the hands of the legi&s;lative? In either ca&s;e the principle would be equally de&s;troyed, and the con&s;equences equally dangerous.</P>
<P>An attempt to an&s;wer the&s;e ob&s;ervations, by appealing to the virtues of the pre&s;ent chief magi&s;trate, and to the confidence ju&s;tly placed in them, will be little calculated, either for his ge|nuine patrioti&s;m, or for the &s;ound judgment of the American public.</P>
<P>The people of the United States would not merit the prai&s;e univer&s;ally allowed to their intelligence, if they did not di&s;tin|gui&s;h between the re&s;pect due to the man, and the functions belonging to the office. In expre&s;&s;ing the former, there is no limit or guide, but the feelings of the grateful heart. In decid|ing the latter, they will con&s;ult the con&s;titution; they will con|&s;ider human nature, and, looking beyond the character of the exi&s;ting magi&s;trate, fix their eyes on the precedent which mu&s;t de&s;cend to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Will it be more than truth to &s;ay, that this great and venerable name is too often a&s;&s;umed for what cannot recommend it&s;elf, and for what there is neither proof nor probability, that its &s;anction can be claimed? Do arguments fail? Is the public mind to be encountered? There are not a few ever ready to invoke the name of Wa&s;hington; to garni&s;h their heretical doctrines with his virtues, and &s;ea&s;on their unpalletable mea&s;ures with his ho&s;pitality. Tho&s;e who take this liberty, will not, however, be mi&s;taken; his true&s;t friends will be the la&s;t to &s;port with his in|fluence, above all, for electioneering purpo&s;es. And it is but a fair &s;u&s;picion, that they who draw mo&s;t largely on that fund, are ha&s;tening fa&s;te&s;t to bankruptcy in their own. As vain would be the attempt to explain away &s;uch alarming attacks on the con&s;titution, by pleading the difficulty, in &s;ome ca&s;es, of draw|ing a line between the different departments of power; or by recurring to the little precedents which may have crept in, at urgent or unguarded moments.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied, that there may, in certain ca&s;es, be a difficulty in di&s;tingui&s;hing the exact boundary between legi&s;lative and executive powers; but the real friend of the con&s;titution, and of liberty, by his endeavors to le&s;&s;en or avoid the difficulty, will ea&s;ily be known from him who labours to encrea&s;e the ob|&s;curity, in order to remove the con&s;titutional land-marks with|out notice.</P>
<P>Nor will it be denied, that precedents may be found, where the line of &s;eparation between the&s;e powers has not been &s;uffici|ently regarded; where an improper latitude of di&s;cretion parti|cularly has been given, or allowed, to the executive depart|ments. But what does this prove? That the line ought to be considered as imaginary; that con&s;titutional organization of
<PB N="14" REF="029017_0014_0FDE96332255A088">
powers ought to lo&s;e their effect? No&mdash;It proves with how much deliberation precedents ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and with how much caution arguments from them &s;hould be admitted. It may furni&s;h another criterion, al&s;o, between the real and often|&s;ible friend of con&s;titutional liberty. The fir&s;t will be as vigilant in re&s;i&s;ting, as the la&s;t will be in promoting the growth of in|con&s;iderate or in&s;idious precedents, into e&s;tabli&s;hed encroach|ments.</P>
<P>The next charge to be examined, is the tendency of the pro|po&s;itions to degrade the United States into French colonies.</P>
<P>As it is difficult to argue again&s;t &s;uppo&s;itions made and mul|tiplied at will, &s;o it is happily impo&s;&s;ible to impo&s;e on the good &s;en&s;e of this country, by arguments which re&s;t on &s;uppo&s;itions only. In the pre&s;ent que&s;tion it is fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed, that the ex|erci&s;e of the &s;elf-evident and &s;overeign right of regulating trade, after the example of all independent nations, and that of the example of Great-Britain towards the United States, would in|evitably involve the United States in a war with Great Britain. It is then &s;uppo&s;ed, that&mdash;the other combined powers, though &s;ome of them be favored by the regulations propo&s;ed, and all of them be jealous of the maritime predominance of Great Britain, would &s;upport the wrongs of Great Britain again&s;t the rights of the United States, It is la&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed, that our allies (the French) in the event of &s;ucce&s;s in e&s;tabli&s;hing their own liber|ties, which they owe to our example, would be willing, as well as able, to rob us of ours, which they a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in obtaining; and that &s;o malignant is their di&s;po&s;ition on this head, that we &s;hould not be &s;pared, even if embarked in a war again&s;t her own enemy. To fini&s;h the picture, it is intimated, that in the cha|racter of allies, we are the more expo&s;ed to this danger, from the &s;ecret and ho&s;tile ambition of France.</P>
<P>It will not be expected, that any formal refutation &s;hould be wa&s;ted on ab&s;urdities which an&s;wer them&s;elves. None but tho&s;e who have &s;urrendered their rea&s;oning faculties to the evidences of their prejudices, will li&s;ten to &s;ugge&s;tions implying, that the free&s;t nation in Europe is the ba&s;e&s;t people on the face of the earth; that in&s;tead of the friendly and fe&s;tive &s;ympathy indulged by the people of the United States, they ought to go into mourn|ing at every triumph of the French arms; that in&s;tead of re|garding the French revolution as a ble&s;&s;ing to mankind, and a bulwark to their own, they ought to anticipate its &s;ucce&s;s as of all events the mo&s;t formidable to their liberty and &s;overeignty; and that, calculating on the political connection with that nati|on, as the &s;ource of additional danger from its enmity and its u&s;urpation, the fir&s;t favorable moment ought to be &s;eized for putting an end to it.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject, however, without reflect|ing, with grief and &s;urprise, on the readine&s;s with which many
<PB N="15" REF="029017_0015_0FDE96355EE0F010">
launch into &s;peculations unfriendly to the &s;truggles of France, and regardle&s;s of the intere&s;ting relations in which that country &s;tands to this. They &s;eem to be more &s;truck with every circum|&s;tance that can be made a topic of reproach, or of chimerical apprehen&s;ions, than with all the &s;plendid objects which are vi&s;i|ble through the gloom of a revolution. But if there be an American who can &s;ee, without benovolent joy, the pro&s;pects of that liberty to which he owes his own happine&s;s, intere&s;t, at lea&s;t, ought to find a place in his calculations: And if he can|not enlarge his views to the influence of the &s;ucce&s;&s;es and friend|&s;hip of France, or our &s;afety as a nation, and particularly as a republic, how can he be in&s;en&s;ible to the benefits pre&s;ented to the United States in her commerce? The French markets con|&s;ume more of our be&s;t productions, than are con&s;umed by any other nation. If a balance in &s;pecie be as favorable as is u&s;ually &s;uppo&s;ed, the &s;um which &s;upplies the immen&s;e drains of our &s;pecie, is derived al&s;o from the &s;ame &s;ource, more than from any other. And in the great and precious article of navigation, the &s;hare of American tonnage employed in the trade with the French dominions, gives to that trade a di&s;tingui&s;hed value; as well to that part of the union which mo&s;t depends on &s;hips and &s;eamen for its pro&s;perity, as to that which mo&s;t requires them for its protection.</P>
<P>Whenever the&s;e con&s;iderations &s;hall have their full weight, which a calm review will not fail to allow them, none will won|der more than the mercantile cla&s;s of citizens them&s;elves, that whil&s;t they &s;o anxiou&s;ly wait &s;tipulations from Great Britain, which are always within our command, &s;o much indifference &s;hould be felt to tho&s;e more important privileges in the trade of France, which, if not &s;ecured by a &s;ea&s;onable improvement of the commercial treaty with her, may po&s;&s;ibly be forever lo&s;t to us.</P>
<P>Among the a&s;per&s;ions propagated again&s;t the friends, and the merits arrogated by the opponents, of the commercial propo&s;i|tions, much u&s;e has been made of the envoy-&s;hip extraordinary to Great Britain. It has been affirmed, that the former was aver&s;e to the mea&s;ure, on account of its pacific tendency; and that it was embraced by the latter, as the proper &s;ub&s;titute for all commercial operations on the policy of Great Britain. It is to be remembered,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That this mea&s;ure originated wholly with the executive.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the oppo&s;ition to it in the &s;enate (as far as the public have any knowledge of it) was made, not to the mea&s;ure of ap|pointing an envoy extraordinary, but to the appointment of the chief ju&s;tice of the United States for that &s;ervice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives never gave any opinion on the occa&s;ion, and that no opinion appears to have been ex|pre&s;&s;ed in debate by any individual of that hou&s;e, which can be

<ITEM>4. That the mea&s;ure did not take place until the commercial propo&s;itions had received all the oppo&s;ition that could be given to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That there is no &s;park of evidence, that if the envoy-&s;hip had never taken place, or been thought of, the opponents of the propo&s;itions would have concurred in any commercial mea&s;ures whatever, even after the We&s;t-India &s;poliations had laid in their full claim to the public attention.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But it may be fairly a&s;ked of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed fir&s;t the Commer|cial Propo&s;itions, and then the Non-Importation bill, and who <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> their ju&s;tification on the appointment of an envoy extraordinary; wherein lay the incon&s;i&s;tency between the&s;e Legi&s;lative and Execu|tive plans?</P>
<P>Was it thought be&s;t to appeal to the Voluntary Ju&s;tice, or liberal policy of Great Britain, and to the&s;e only? This was not certainly the ca&s;e with tho&s;e, who oppo&s;ed the Commercial Appeals to the intere&s;t and the apprehen&s;ion of Great Britain; Becau&s;e they were the mo&s;t zealous for appealing to her fears, by military preparations and menaces. If the&s;e had any meaning, they avowed that Great Britain was not to be brought to rea&s;on, otherwi&s;e than by the dan|ger of injuring her&s;elf. And &s;uch being her di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he would, of cour&s;e, be mo&s;t influenced by mea&s;ures, of which the compara|tive operation would be mo&s;t again&s;t her. Whether that would be apprehended from mea&s;ures of the one, or the other kind will ea&s;ily be decided. But in every view, it <HI>fear</HI> was a proper auxiliary to negociation, the appeal to it in the Commercial Mea&s;ures propo&s;|ed, could not be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Envoy&s;hip. The incon&s;i&s;ten|cy belongs to the reasoning of tho&s;e who would pronounce it pro|per and effectual to &s;ay to Great-Britain, do us ju&s;tice, or we will &s;eize on Canada, though the lo&s;s will be trifling to you, whil&s;t the co&s;t will be immen&s;e to us; and &s;o pronounce it improper and in|effectual to &s;ay to Great-Britain, do us ju&s;tice, or you will &s;uffer a wound, where you will mo&s;t of all feel it, in a branch of your commerce, which feeds one part of your dominions, and &s;ends an|nually to the other, a balance in &s;pecie of more than ten millions of dollars.</P>
<P>The opponents of the commercial mea&s;ures may be a&s;ked, in the next place, to what cau&s;e the i&s;&s;ue of the envoy-&s;hip, if &s;ucce&s;sful, ought to be a&s;cribed?</P>
<P>Will it have the pure effect of a benevolent and conciliatory di&s;po&s;ition in Great Britain towards the United States? This will hardly be pretended by her warme&s;t admirers and advocates. It is di&s;proved by the whole tenor of her conduct ever &s;ince we were an independent and republican nation. Had this cordial di&s;po&s;ition, or even a di&s;po&s;ition to do us ju&s;tice, been really

felt; the delay would not have been &s;pun out to &s;o late a day. The moment would rather have been cho&s;en, when we were lea&s;t in condition, to vindicate our intere&s;t, by united councils and per&s;evering efforts. The motives then would have been &s;trong|e&s;t, and the merit mo&s;t con&s;picuous. In&s;tead of this honorable and prudent courle, it has been the vigilant &s;tudy of Great Bri|tain, to take all po&s;&s;ible advantage of our embarra&s;&s;ments; nor has the lea&s;t inclination been &s;hewn to relax her &s;y&s;tem, except at the cri&s;is in 1783, already mentioned, when, not fore&s;eeing the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments, &s;he was alarmed for her commerce with the United States.</P>
<P>Will the &s;ucce&s;s be a&s;cribeable to the re&s;pect paid to that coun|try by the mea&s;ure, or to the talents and addre&s;s of the envoy.</P>
<P>Such an explanation of the fact, is ab&s;olutely precluded by a &s;eries of other facts.</P>
<P>Soon after the peace, Mr. Adams, the pre&s;ent Vice Pre&s;ident of the United States, was oppointed Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary to the Briti&s;h Court. The mea&s;ure was more re&s;pectful as no mu|tual arrangement had been premi&s;ed between the two countries, nor any intimation received from Great Britain, that the civility &s;hould be returned; nor was the civility returned during the whole period of his re&s;idence. The manner in which he was treated, and the United States, through him, his protracted exer|tions, and the mortifying inefficacy of them, are too much in the public remembrance to need a rehear&s;al.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t e&s;lay on the temper of Great Britain, towards the United States, was prior to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Federal Con|&s;titution. The important change produced in our &s;ituation by this event, led to another e&s;&s;ay, which is not unknown to the public. Although in &s;trictne&s;s, it might not unrea&s;onably have been expected, after what had been done in the in&s;tance of Mr. Adams, that the advance towards a diplomatic accommodation &s;hould then have come from Great Britain. Mr. G. Morris was made an agent for feeling her pul&s;e, and &s;oothing her pride, a &s;econd time. The hi&s;tory of his operations is not particularly known. It is certain, however, that this repetition of the ad|vance, produced no &s;en&s;ible change on her di&s;po&s;ition towards us, much le&s;s any actual compliance with our ju&s;t expectations and demands. The mo&s;t that can be &s;aid is, that it was, after a con&s;iderable interval, followed by the mi&s;&s;ion of Mr. Hammond to the United States, who, as it is &s;aid, however refu&s;ed, not|with&s;tanding the long re&s;idence of Mr. Adams at the court of London, without a return of the civility, to commit the dignity of his ma&s;ter, until the mo&s;t explicit a&s;&s;urances were given, that Mr. Pinckney &s;hould immediately counterplace him.</P>
<P>The mi&s;&s;ion of this la&s;t re&s;pectable citizen, forms a third ap|peal to the ju&s;tice and good will of the Briti&s;h Government, on the &s;ubjects between the two countries. His negociations on that &s;ide the Atlantic, as well as tho&s;e through Mr. Hammond on his, having been laid before the Congre&s;s, and printed for gene

It will only be remarked, that they terminated here in the di&s;clo&s;ure, that Mr. Hammond had no authority, either to adju&s;t the differences connected with the Treaty of Peace, or to concur in any &s;olid arrangements, for reciprocity in Commerce and Navigation; and that in Great Britain, they terminated in the conviction of Mr. Pinckney, that nothing was to be expected from the voluntary ju&s;tice or policy of that country, and in his advice, before quot|ed, of <HI>Commercial Regulations,</HI> as the be&s;t means for obtaining a compliance with our ju&s;t claims.</P>
<P>All who weigh the&s;e facts with candor, will join in conclud|ing, that the &s;ucce&s;s of the envoy&s;hip mu&s;t be otherwi&s;e explain|ed, than by the operation of diplomatic compliments, or of per|&s;onal talents.</P>
<P>To what cau&s;es then will the United States be truly indebted, for any favorable re&s;ult to the envoy&s;hip.</P>
<P>Every well-informed and unprejudiced mind, will an&s;wer to the following:</P>
<P>1. The &s;pirit of America, expre&s;&s;ed by the vote of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, on the &s;ubject of the Commercial Propo&s;iti|ons, by the large majority of that hou&s;e (overruled by the ca&s;ting voice in the Senate) in favor of the non importation bill and by the act laying an embargo. Although the&s;e proceedings would, doubtle&s;s, have been more officious, if the two former had ob|tained the &s;anction of laws, and if the la&s;t had not been &s;o &s;oon repealed; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That this is particularly true of the embargo, is certain, as well from the known affidavit of that mea&s;ure in the We&s;t Indies as from the admi&s;&s;ion of the We&s;t India planters in their late petition to the King and Council of Great Britain.</NOTE> yet they mu&s;t have had no little effect, as warnings to the Briti&s;h government; that if her ob&s;tinacy take away the la&s;t pretext from the opponents of &s;uch mea&s;ures, it might be impo&s;&s;ible to divide or mi&s;lead our public councils with re&s;pect to them in future.</P>
<P>There is no room to pretend, that her relaxation in this ca&s;e, if &s;he &s;hould relax, will be the effect, not of tho&s;e proceedings, but of the ultimate defect of them; former defeats of a like poli|cy, had repeatedly taken place, and are known to have produc|ed, in&s;tead of relaxation, a more confirmed per&s;everance, on the part of Great-Britain. Under the old confederation, the Unit|ed States had not the power over commerce: of that &s;ituation &s;he took advantage. The new government which contained the power, did not evince the will to exert it; of that &s;ituation &s;he &s;till took the advantage. Should &s;he yield then at the pre|&s;ent juncture? The problem ought not to be &s;olved, without pre&s;uming her to be &s;atisfied by what has lately pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;that the United States have now, not only the power, but the will to exert it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="029017_0019_0FDE963D5803FEB8">
The rea&s;oning is &s;hort and conclu&s;ive; in the year 1783, when Great Britain apprehended Commercial Re&s;trictions from the United States, &s;he was di&s;po&s;ed to concede and to accomodate. From the year 1783 to the year 1794, when &s;he apprehended no Commercial Re&s;trictions, &s;he &s;hewed no di&s;po&s;ition to concede or to accommodate. In the year 1794, when alarming evidence was giv|en of the danger of Commercial Re&s;trictions, &s;he did concede and accommodate.</P>
<P>If any thing can have weakened the operation of the proceed|ings above referred to on the Briti&s;h government, it mu&s;t be the laboured and vehement attempts of their opponents to &s;how, that the United States had little to demand, and every thing to dread, from Great Britain; that the commerce between the two coun|tries was more e&s;&s;ential to us, than to her; that our citizens would be le&s;s willing than her &s;ubjects to bear, and our govern|ment le&s;s able than hers to enforce re&s;trictions or interruptions of it. In a word, that we were more dependent on her, than &s;he was on us; and, therefore, ought to court her act to withdraw from us her &s;upplies, though chiefly luxuries, in&s;tead of threat|ening to withdraw from her our &s;upplies, though mo&s;tly nece&s;|&s;aries.</P>
<P>It is difficult to &s;ay, whether the indi&s;cretion or the fallacy of &s;uch arguments be the more remarkable feature in them. All that can be hoped is, that an antidote to their mi&s;chievous ten|dency in Great Britain may be found in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s there|of, the errors on which they are founded, and the contempt which they will be known to have excited in this country.</P>
<P>2. The other cau&s;e will be, the po&s;ture into which Europe has been thrown, by the war with France, and particularly by the campaign of 1794. The combined armies have every where felt the &s;uperior valour, di&s;cipline, and re&s;ources of their repub|lican enemies. Pru&s;&s;ia, after heavy and perfidious draughts on the Briti&s;h trea&s;ury, has retired from the common &s;tandard, to contend with new dangers peculiar to her&s;elf. Au&s;tria, worn out in unavailing re&s;i&s;tance, her arms di&s;graced, her trea&s;ure exhau&s;ted, and her va&s;&s;als di&s;contented, &s;eeks her la&s;t con&s;ola|tion on the &s;ame &s;ource of Briti&s;h &s;ub&s;idy. The Dutch, in&s;tead of continuing their proportion of aids for the war, have their whole faculties turned over to France. Spain, with all her wealth and all her pride, is pal&s;ied in every nerve, and forced to la&s;t re&s;orts of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">oyalty, to a reduction of &s;alaries and pen&s;ions, and to the hoards of &s;uper&s;tition. Great Britain her&s;elf has &s;een her military glory eclip&s;ed, her projects confounded, her hopes bla&s;ted, her marine threatened, her re&s;ources overcharged, and her government in danger of lo&s;ing its energy, by the de&s;potic excu&s;es into which it has been over&s;trained.</P>
<P>If, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, &s;he does not abandon her&s;elf to apathy and de&s;pair, it is becau&s;e &s;he finds her credit &s;till alive, and in that credit &s;ees &s;ome po&s;&s;ibility of making terms with misfortune. But what is the ba&s;is of that credit? Her com|merce.
<PB N="20" REF="029017_0020_0FDE9642957E03A0">
And what is the mo&s;t valuable remnant of that re&s;ource? The commerce with the U. States. Will &s;he ri&s;k this be&s;t part of her la&s;t re&s;ource, by per&s;evering in her &s;elfi&s;h and unju&s;t treat|ment of the United States?</P>
<P>Time will give a final an&s;wer to this que&s;tion. All that can be now pronounced is, that if, on the awful precipice to which G. Britain is drawn, &s;he will open neither her eyes to her danger, not her heart to her duty, her character mu&s;t be a greater con|tra&s;t to the picture of it drawn by the opponents of the com|mercial mea&s;ures, than could have ea&s;ily been imagined. If, on the other hand, &s;he &s;hould relent, and con&s;ult her rea&s;on, the change will be accounted for by her pro&s;pects on the other &s;ide of the atlantic, and the countenance exhibited on this, without &s;uppo&s;ing her character to vary, in a &s;ingle feature, from the view of it entertained by the friends of &s;uch mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>That the ri&s;ing &s;pirit of America, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of France, will have been the real cau&s;es of any favorable terms obtained by the mi&s;&s;ion of Mr. Jay, cannot be controverted. Had the &s;ame &s;orbearance, which was tried for ten years on the part of the United States, been continued; and had the combined powers proceeded in the victorious career which has &s;ignalized the French arms; under this rever&s;e of circum&s;tances, the mo&s;t bigotted Engli&s;hman will be a&s;hamed to &s;ay, that any relaxing change in the policy of his government, was to be hoped for by the United States.</P>
<P>Such are the reflections which occur on the &s;uppo&s;ition of a &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue to the envoy &s;hip. Should it unhappily turn out, that neither the new countenance pre&s;ented by America, nor the adver&s;e fortunes of Great Britain, can bend the latter to a rea&s;onable accommodation, it may be worth while to enquire, what will probably be the evidence furni&s;hed by the friends and adver&s;aries of commercial mea&s;ures, with re&s;pect to then com|parative attachments to peace? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When this was written, the re&s;ult of Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion was wholly unknown.</NOTE></P>
<P>If any regard be paid to con&s;i&s;tency, tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed all &s;uch mea&s;ures mu&s;t be for an in&s;tant, re&s;ort to arms. With them there was no alternative, but negociation or war. Their language was, let us try the former, but be prepared for the latter; if the olive branch fail, let the &s;word vindicate our rights, as it has vindicated the rights of other nations. A real war is both more honorable and more eligible than commercial regulations. In the&s;e G. B. is an overmatch for us.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, the friends of commercial mea&s;ures, if con&s;i&s;t|ent, will prefer the&s;e mea&s;ures, as an intermediate experiment be|tween negociation and war. They will per&s;i&s;t in their language, that Great-Britain is more dependent on us, than we are on here that this has ever been the American &s;entiment, and is the true ba&s;s of American can policy; that war &s;hould not be re&s;orted to, till every
<PB N="21" REF="029017_0021_0FDE9644298209A0">
thing &s;hort of war has been tried; that if Great-Britain be invulner|able to our attacks, it is in her fleets and armies; that if the United States bring her to rea&s;on at all, the &s;ure&s;t as well as the cheape&s;t means, will be a judicious &s;y&s;tem of commercial operations; that here the United States are unque&s;tionably an overmatch for Great-Britain.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be the ardent prayer of all, that the occa&s;ion may not hap|pen for &s;uch a te&s;t of the con&s;i&s;tency and the di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e who&s;e coun&s;els were &s;o materially different on the &s;ubject of a com|mercial vindication of our rights; &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e ordained, the public ju&s;tice will pronounce on which &s;ide, the politics were mo&s;t aver&s;e to war, and mo&s;t anxious for every pacific effort, that might at the &s;ame time be an efficient one, in preference to that la&s;t and dreadful re&s;ort of injured nations.</P>
<P>There remains two &s;ubjects belonging to the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s under review, on each of which &s;ome comments are made (proper) by the mi&s;repre&s;entations which have been propagated.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, The naval armament.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, The new taxes then e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, it appears from the debates and other accounts, to have been urged in favor of the mea&s;ure, that &s;ix frigates of one hundred and eighty four guns, to be &s;tationed at the mouth of the Mediterranean, would be &s;ufficient to protect the American trade again&s;t the Algerine pirates; that &s;uch a force would not co&s;t more than &s;ix hundred thou&s;and dollars, including an out-&s;et of &s;tores and provi&s;ions for &s;ix months, and might be built in time to take their &s;tation by July or Augu&s;t la&s;t; that the expence of this armament would be fully ju&s;tified by the importance of our trade to the &s;outh of Europe; that without &s;uch a protection, the whole trade of the Atlantic would be expo&s;ed to depredation; nay, that the American coa&s;t might not e&s;cape the enterpri&s;ing avarice of the&s;e roving Bar|barians; that &s;uch an effort on the part of the United States, was particularly due to the unfortunate citizens already groaning in chains and pining in de&s;pair, as well as to tho&s;e who might otherwi&s;e be involved in the &s;ame &s;ate. Other con&s;iderations of le&s;s influence may have entered into the deci&s;ion on the &s;ame &s;ide.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, it was &s;aid, that the force was in&s;ufficient for the object; that the expence would be greater than was e&s;timated; that there was a limit to the expence, which could be afforded for the protection of any branch of trade; that the aggregate value of the annual trade, export and import to Spain and Portugal, appeared from authentic documents not to exceed three and an half millions of dollars, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears by a late official document, that the amount of the trade &s;ince that period has con&s;iderably increa&s;ed in value; but it may be remarked, that in the &s;ame ratio, the motives to renew the protection, have been &s;trengthened in Portugal and Spain.</NOTE> that the profit only, on this amount, was to be compared with the expence of the frigates; that if the American ve&s;&s;els engaged in tho&s;e channels, &s;hould give place to ve&s;&s;els at peace with Algiers,
<PB N="22" REF="029017_0022_0FDE9645B7F7FCD8">
they would repair to the channels quitted by the latter ve&s;&s;els; &s;o that it would be rather a change than a lo&s;s of employment; that the other di&s;tant branches of our trade, would be little affected and our own coa&s;t not at all; that the frigates, at &s;o great a di&s;tance on a turbulent &s;ea, would be expo&s;ed to danger, as well as attended with expences, not to be calculated; and it &s;tationed where intended, would leave our trade up the Mediterranean as unprotected as it is at pre&s;ent. That in addition to the&s;e con&s;iderations, the frigates would not be ready by the time &s;tated, nor probably until the war, and the occa&s;ion would be over; that if the removal of the Portugue&s;e &s;qua|dron from the blockade really proceeded, as was alledged from Great-Britain, &s;he would, under &s;ome pretext or other, contrive to defeat the object of the frigates; that if Great-Britain was not at the bottom of the mea&s;ure, the intere&s;t which Portugal had in our trade, which &s;upplies her with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, would &s;oon re&s;tore the protection &s;he had withdrawn; that it would be more effectual as well as cheaper, to concert arrangements with Portugal, by which the United States would be &s;ubjected to an equitable &s;hare only, in|&s;tead of taking on them&s;elves the whole of the burden; that as to our unfortunate citizens in captivity, the frigates could neither be in time nor of force, to relieve them; that money alone could do this, and that a &s;ufficient &s;um ought to be provided for the purpo&s;e: that it was moreover to be con&s;idered, that if there were any di&s;po&s;ition in Great-Britain, to be initiated into a war with us, or to &s;eek an occa|&s;ion for it; tho&s;e, who on other que&s;tions had taken that ground of argument, ought to be particularly aware of danger, from the col|li&s;ion of naval armaments, within the &s;phere of Briti&s;h jealou&s;y, and in the way perhaps of a favorite object.</P>
<P>No undue blame is meant to be thrown on tho&s;e, who did not yield to this rea&s;oning, however conclu&s;ive it may now appear.&mdash;The vote in favor of the mea&s;ure was indeed &s;o checquered, that it cannot even be attributed to the influence of party. It is but ju&s;tice at the &s;ame time, to tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ure, to remark, that in&s;tead of the frigates being at their de&s;tined &s;tation in July or Augu&s;t la&s;t, the keel of one only was laid in December; the timber for the re&s;t being then in the fore&s;t, and the whole of the pre&s;ent year &s;tat|ed to be nece&s;&s;ary for their completion; that con&s;equently it is near|ly certain now, they will not be in &s;ervice, before the war in Eu|rope will be over, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be added, that the original e&s;timate and appropriation for the annual &s;upport of the frigates, was two hundred and forty|&s;even thou&s;and, nine hundred dollars only; whereas the &s;um re|quired at the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, by the Secretary of War, for &s;ix months &s;upport, in the year 1795, is two hundred twenty-four thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-four dollars; making the annual &s;upport four hundred forty-nine thou&s;and, five hundred and eight dollars.</NOTE> and that in the mean time it has turned out as it was foretold, that Portugal has felt &s;ufficient motives to renew the blockade; &s;o that if the frigates had been adapted to the origin|al object, they would not be required for it, more e&s;pecially, as it
<PB N="23" REF="029017_0023_0FDE9650B6D32FD0">
his likewi&s;e turned out according to another anticipation, that mo|ney would alone be the agent for re&s;toring the captive exiles to their freedom and their country.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aid, that the frigates, though not nece&s;&s;ary or proper for the &s;ervice fir&s;t contemplated, may u&s;efully be applied to the &s;ecurity of our coa&s;ts, again&s;t Pirates, Privateers, and Smugglers. This is a di&s;tinct que&s;tion. The &s;ole and avowed object of the na|val armament was the protection of our trade again&s;t the Algerines. To that object the force is appropriated by the law it&s;elf. The Pre|&s;ident can apply it to no other: If any other now pre&s;ents it&s;elf, it may fairly be now di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, but as it was not the object then, the mea&s;ure cannot be te&s;ted by it now. If there be &s;ufficient rea&s;ons of any &s;ort for &s;uch a naval e&s;tabli&s;hment, tho&s;e who di&s;approved it for an impracticable and impolitic object, may with perfect con&s;i&s;tency allow the&s;e rea&s;ons their full weight. It is much to be que&s;tioned, however, whether any good rea&s;on could be found for going on with the whole undertaking; be&s;ides, that in ge|neral the commencement of political mea&s;ures under one pretext, and the pro&s;ecution of them under another, has always an a&s;pect, that ju&s;tifies circum&s;pection if not &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the new taxes, the &s;econd remaining &s;ubject, a ve|ry brief explanation will be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>From a general view of the proceedings of Congre&s;s on this &s;ub|ject, it appears, that the advocates for the new taxes urged them. 1&s;t. On the probability of a diminution of the import for 1794, as an ef|fect of &s;ome of the que&s;tions agitated in Congre&s;s on the amount of exports from Great Britain to the United States. 2dly. On the pro|bability of war with Great Britain, which would &s;till further de&s;troy the revenue, at the &s;ame time that it would beget an immen&s;e ad|dition to the public expenditures. On the fir&s;t of the&s;e points, tho&s;e who did not concur in the new taxes, at lea&s;t in all of them, de|nied the probability of any material diminution of the import with|out a war: On the other point, they denied any &s;uch probability of a war, as to require what was propo&s;ed; and in both the&s;e opinions, they have been ju&s;tified by &s;ub&s;equent experience. War has not taken place, nor does it appear never to have been meditated, unle&s;s in the &s;ubverting the French Republic, which was never probable, whil&s;t the revenue from the import, in&s;tead of being dimini&s;hed, has very con&s;iderably exceed any former amount.</P>
<P>It will not be improper to remark, as a further elucidation of this &s;ubject. 1&s;t. That mo&s;t, if not all, who refu&s;ed to concur in &s;ome of the new taxes as not ju&s;tified by the occa&s;ion, actually con|curred in others which were lea&s;t objectionable, as an accommodat|ing precaution again&s;t contingencies. 2d. That the objection to one or the taxes was its breach of the con&s;titution; an objection in|&s;aperable in its nature, and which there is rea&s;on to believe, will be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the judicial authority, if ever brought to that te&s;t; and that the objections to others were &s;uch as had always had weight with the mo&s;t enlightened patriots of America. 3. That in the opi|nions of the mo&s;t zealous patrons of new Ways and Means, the oc|ca&s;ion,
<PB N="24" REF="029017_0024_0FDE965310B129B0">
critical as they pre&s;&s;ed it, did not ultimately ju&s;tify all the taxes propo&s;ed. It appears in particular, that a bill impo&s;ing a vari|ety of duties, mo&s;tly in the nature of &s;tamp duties, into which, a du|ty on transfers of &s;tock, had been in&s;erted as an amendment, was the la&s;t &s;tage defeated, by tho&s;e who had in general, urged the new taxes and this very bill it&s;elf in the earlier &s;tage of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e, with the preceding observations, on a very intere&s;ting pe|riod of Congre&s;&s;ional hi&s;tory, will be left to the candid judgement of the public. Such as may not before have viewed the tran&s;action of that period, through any other medium than the mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions which have been circulated, will have an opportunity of doin ju&s;tice to them&s;elves, as well as to others. And no doubt can be en|tertained, that in this as in all other ca&s;es, it will be found, that truth &s;tifled or perverted for a time, will finally triumph in the detection of calumny, and in the contempt which awaits its authors.</P>
