<BIBL><HI>PSALM</HI> CXXVII. I.</BIBL>
<Q>EXCEPT THE LORD KEEP THE CITY, THE WATCH|MAN WAKETH <HI>BUT</HI> in VAIN.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_BY the words now before us, we are taught the following intere&s;ting le&s;|&s;on, That having made u&s;e of all the means in our power, to guard again&s;t the evils to which we are expo&s;ed, our dependence mu&s;t be placed on the Providence of God.</P>
<P>As this truth will apply univer&s;ally, in all ca&s;es of danger and trouble, in the following Di&s;cour&s;e I will call your attention to &s;ome of the dangers and evils, to which large towns and cities are particularly expo|&s;ed. I will then &s;ugge&s;t a few con&s;iderations, tending to impre&s;s on our mind the important le&s;&s;on expre&s;&s;ed in the text.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, our attention &s;hall be given to &s;ome of the dangers and evils, to which large towns and cities are particularly expo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="032358_0004_0FF1F0604C621310">
Large towns and cities are more expo&s;ed to the calamities of war, than le&s;s populous places.</P>
<P>People are invited to &s;ettle in towns and cities, by the advantages which they offer to commerce, to man|ufactures, and the u&s;eful arts. The wealth of towns and cities bears a general proportion to their extent and population. In times of war, therefore, the large&s;t towns and cities will be objects to which an enemy will give the fir&s;t attention. The conque&s;t of &s;uch places has a double effect: It weakens the country invaded, and by adding wealth to the conqueror, ena|bles him to make farther depredations.</P>
<P>In all countries, where invading armies are &s;ucce&s;s|ful, large towns and cities have been expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t calamities. I need not be particular in re|peating in&s;tances. The hi&s;torical part of the Bible,&mdash; the hi&s;tories of modern nations, and of the age in which we live, are full of them.</P>
<P>Large towns and cities are more expo&s;ed to the calamities ari&s;ing from &s;edition and rebellion, than le&s;s populous places.</P>
<P>Experience teaches, what indeed would be natural to expect, that the fermentation of party zeal has been more violent, and productive of more &s;erious con&s;equences in large towns and cities, than in &s;mall places. In towns and cities, men of re&s;tle&s;s temper and &s;editions &s;pirits can have frequent communica|tions; and having devi&s;ed mi&s;chief, they can with more expedition and effect execute their purpo&s;es, than in places where accomplices are &s;pread over a con&s;iderable &s;pace of country.</P>
<P>Large towns and cities are more expo&s;ed to infec|tions and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, than le&s;s populous places.
<PB N="7" REF="032358_0005_0FF1F06206C31C10">In places crowded with inhabitants, the air which is inhaled, is charged with noxious vapours.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places, fatal di&s;orders are generated by the action of heat on bodies capable of di&s;charging a mor|tal poi&s;on: In other places, if di&s;ea&s;es of the wor&s;t kind are not generated, the con&s;titutions of people may be predi&s;po&s;ed to receive infection, when it is brought to them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who make the healing art their &s;tudy have noticed the malignancy of particular di&s;orders, in par|ticular parts of crowded cities.</P>
<P>Large towns and cities are more expo&s;ed to the rage of devouring flames, than &s;maller places. The dan|ger from this evil may be con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by the u&s;e of &s;uch materials, in the con&s;truction of build|ings, as will re&s;i&s;t the flames: It is however next to impo&s;&s;ible, to erect hou&s;es, fit to be inhabited, without having a certain portion of the materials, of a combu&s;|tible nature.</P>
<P>Such is the con&s;titution and frame of our body, that it is equally nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t the effects of cold and damp habitations, as again&s;t the danger of fire: &s;o that by carrying our caution to an extreme again&s;t fire, we might po&s;&s;ibly expo&s;e our&s;elves to other evils fatal to our health and comfort. The danger of fire, however, cannot be too watchfully counteracted in a town like <HI>this,</HI> in which we live, where the greate&s;t part of the buildings con&s;i&s;t of materials highly com|bu&s;tible. The danger is con&s;tantly before our eyes: we &s;eldom pa&s;s a &s;ea&s;on, without beholding the habi|tation of &s;ome of our neighbours and friends on fire. Although the de&s;truction of property, by this dread|ful enemy, has not been &s;o great during the la&s;t twelve
<PB N="8" REF="032358_0006_0FF1F063D7FF7A78">months, as in &s;ome former &s;ea&s;ons, the cry of fire has been unu&s;ually frequent &s;ince the year commenced, and attended, in &s;ome in&s;tances, with circum&s;tances peculiarly alarming.</P>
<P>We add, once more, Large towns and cities are more expo&s;ed to incen|diaries, and robbers, than &s;maller places.</P>
<P>In large towns, the proportion of abandoned char|acters is greater, than in places more thinly inhabit|ed. The ba&s;e&s;t of mankind find it more ea&s;y to hide them&s;elves; and they find more opportunities to &s;pend the fruits of their wickedne&s;s to their mind, in popu|lous places, than in country villages.</P>
<P>To people in the indu&s;trious and peaceful walks of life, it will appear almo&s;t incredible, that any of the human race can be &s;o vile as to break open your dwelling place when you are at re&s;t, and rob you of the property which you have laid up for your comfort, and the comfort of tho&s;e who depend on the fruits of your indu&s;try. But to the di&s;grace of human nature, we find there are people &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of moral rectitude, &s;o vile and abandoned, as to wander about in the night time, like bea&s;ts of prey, &s;eeking what they can find, and whom they may devour.&mdash; There are people, who, when the virtuous and good are a&s;leep in their beds, devi&s;e mi&s;chief again&s;t them, and endeavour to find out ways to enter their hou&s;es and rob them. There are people, who, when perpe|trating &s;uch acts of violence, would, if po&s;&s;ible, mur|der tho&s;e who oppo&s;e, or venture to arre&s;t them.</P>
<P>In&s;tances of night-robbery and murder, in countries long &s;ettled and full of inhabitants, have not been un|common. From tho&s;e elder and more corrupt parts
<PB N="9" REF="032358_0007_0FF1F065D74E9168">of the earth, &s;ome of the ba&s;e&s;t of men have found the way to America.</P>
<P>It has been &s;u&s;pected, that the late deva&s;tations by fire, in &s;everal of the &s;outhern States, were occa&s;ioned by &s;ome wicked per&s;ons, who have come among us. Strong &s;u&s;picions have been entertained, within a few weeks, that incendiaries and robbers have found the way to Bo&s;ton; and within a few days pa&s;t, we have had alarming evidence, that our &s;u&s;picions were not without rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Several hou&s;es have been broken open in the night, and the inhabitants put in danger of their lives. One of tho&s;e daring enemies of our peace, &s;eized in the very act of robbery, and with a deadly weapon in his hand, is now under &s;entence of death, and in a few days mu&s;t be removed from among the living.</P>
<P>But the &s;olemnity of the trial, which brought to|gether a va&s;t crowd of people, was not &s;ufficient to de|ter other &s;inners, who were at the time lurking in our borders, from crimes equally atrocious.</P>
<P>On the very night after the trial, two other hou&s;es in the town were broken open; to one of which fire was kindled, and had the inhabitants remained igno|rant of their danger a few minutes longer, they mu&s;t have peri&s;hed in the flames.</P>
<P>Imagination cannot de&s;cribe the con&s;ternation we &s;hould have felt, had not the increa&s;ing flame been di&s;covered ju&s;t at the moment. From the combu&s;ti|ble nature of the building to which the fire was kin|died, and of the buildings in the neighbourhood,&mdash; from the <HI>force</HI> and the <HI>direction</HI> of the wind, on that night, it is not probable the fire could have been
<PB N="10" REF="032358_0008_0FF1F069ED9AC248">checked, in its dreadful progre&s;s, until it had laid in ruin a large portion of the town. We thank God for the wonderful pre&s;ervation!</P>
<P>I &s;hould expo&s;e my&s;elf to the ju&s;t re&s;entment of my fellow citizens, did I attempt to excite their fears, and di&s;turb their repo&s;e, without &s;ufficient rea&s;on. But the repeated in&s;tances of hou&s;e-breaking and robbery, and of attempting to &s;et fire to the town, afford painful evidence, that &s;ome of the wor&s;t and mo&s;t dangerous of mankind are now among us: The utmo&s;t vigilance and exertion of the inhabitants are called for on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Having mentioned &s;ome of the dangers and evils to which large towns and cities are more particularly expo&s;ed, it will be natural to inquire, What is to be done?&mdash;will it be advi&s;able to abandon the cities, and &s;pread more thinly over the country?&mdash;or, can we think of any means of guarding again&s;t the dangers and evils to which populous places are particularly expo&s;ed?</P>
<P>Towns and cities grow up with commerce and man|ufactures: They cannot be abandoned, therefore, with|out doing violence to the natural cour&s;e of things in &s;ociety. There are evils in <HI>&s;ociety,</HI> and there are evils in a <HI>&s;tate of nature:</HI> There are evils peculiar to large and crowded places; and there are advantages in &s;ome mea&s;ure to balance them. Evils we &s;hall find, more or le&s;s, in all &s;ituations and employments of life. Be|fore we determine to &s;hift our &s;ituation and employ|ment, we &s;hall do well to make u&s;e of all the means in our power, to &s;ecure our&s;elves again&s;t the evils which attend them; and then, after comparing all circum&s;tances, we may determine, whether a change
<PB N="11" REF="032358_0009_0FF1F06DC3BD6D90">of &s;ituation and employment would, on the whole, give us a greater pro&s;pect of happine&s;s. But after all we can do, let our &s;ituation be what it may, we are taught to place our hope in God, both for &s;ucce&s;s in the bu&s;ine&s;s of life, and for protection in danger and trouble.</P>
<P><Q>Except the Lord keepeth the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e &s;acred words teach us to hope in God as our protector and refuge in trouble; and they teach us that we our&s;elves al&s;o mu&s;t be active and vigilant. We mu&s;t <HI>watch,</HI> as well as <HI>pray.</HI></P>
<P>In this place I would beg leave to mention a few particulars, to which we &s;hall do well to give heed, as we wi&s;h to le&s;&s;en the dangers and evils incident to large and populous places.</P>
<P>The limits of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e will only admit of <HI>Hints,</HI> which I will venture to &s;ugge&s;t under each of the particulars already mentioned; the propriety of which I &s;ubmit to the judgment of my fellow cit|izens.</P>
<P>1&s;t. Large towns and cities are more expo&s;ed to the calamities of war, than &s;maller places. The inhabi|tants, therefore, if they are wi&s;e, will endeavour to keep peace with all tho&s;e powers which are able to injure them: They will be careful not to give occa|&s;ion, by threatening &s;peeches, or by any unrighteous conduct, either to their neighbours, or foreign pow|ers, to make war upon them.</P>
<P>But as the rulers of the nations are more generally governed by pa&s;&s;ion and &s;elf-intere&s;t, than by rea&s;on and equity, and people who were the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive
<PB N="12" REF="032358_0010_0FF1F06FA3919B28">have been invaded, the inhabitants of rich towns and cities will do well, even in profound peace, to provide for their defence: But in the pre&s;ent re&s;tle&s;s &s;tate of the world, when nations ri&s;e up again&s;t nations, and the fury of war creates innumerable wants, tho&s;e who are not particularly connected with the contending powers need to be on their guard, and fortify again&s;t lawle&s;s invaders. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note 1&s;t See Appendix.</NOTE></P>
<P>2dly. Large towns and cities are more expo&s;ed to the calamities ari&s;ing from &s;edition and rebellion, than le&s;s populous places. The wi&s;e and virtuous, therefore, will endeavour, by all prudent means, to counteract a factious &s;pirit: They will unite, and come forward with alacrity and firmne&s;s, to &s;upport government and with&s;tand the turbulence of unrea&s;onable men.</P>
<P>3dly. Large towns and cities are more expo&s;ed to infectious and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, than le&s;s populous places. Wi&s;dom and the healing art will at all times lend their aid to prevent the &s;pread of fatal di&s;orders, and guard the inhabitants of crowded places again&s;t the maladies to which they are particularly expo&s;ed. The removal of all putre&s;cent matter&mdash;cleanline&s;s, and a free circulation of good air, are certainly among the fir&s;t things nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of health in large towns and cities. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Note 2d. See Appendix.</NOTE></P>
<P>4thly. Large towns and cities are more expo&s;ed to devouring flames, than &s;maller places. The inhabi|tants of large and crowded places are therefore re|quired to be particularly watchful. Much may be done to guard again&s;t this calamity by brick walls, and the u&s;e of &s;uch materials for covering, as are not
<PB N="13" REF="032358_0011_0FF1F0717948EEA8">combu&s;tible: But after all that can be done, in the ways above mentioned, under Providence, &s;afety de|pends very much on the habitual attention and vigi|lance of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>5thly. Large towns and cities are more expo&s;ed to incendiaries, and robbers, than &s;maller places.</P>
<P>To le&s;&s;en the danger, from the enemies now men|tioned, it will be nece&s;&s;ary that the government of large towns and cities be &s;ufficiently vigorous to ap|prehend, and confine, all &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons.</P>
<P>As towns and cities increa&s;e in population and wealth, it is found nece&s;&s;ary that the government be more vigorous, and that it proceed with more firmne&s;s and di&s;patch, than in the earlier &s;tages of &s;ociety. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note 3d. See Appendix.</NOTE></P>
<P>But as I only mean to give a few hints, tending to our &s;ecurity again&s;t the dangers and evils incident to populous places, I would leave them with my fellow citizens, and go on, according to promi&s;e,</P>
<P>To &s;ugge&s;t a few con&s;iderations, in order to impre&s;s on our mind the importance of tru&s;ting in God as our protector and refuge in danger and trouble.</P>
<P>Having done all in our power, we &s;till need the protection of Omnipotence. The le&s;&s;on contained in the text cannot be too frequently inculcated: The important idea cannot be too deeply engraven on our heart: <Q>Except the Lord keep the city, the watch|man waketh but in vain.</Q> The enemies of our peace and &s;afety may be working in &s;ecret places, where the mo&s;t vigilant eye of man cannot &s;ee them. But while their de&s;igns are hidden from us, and we know nothing of them, all their wicked plans are known to
<PB N="14" REF="032358_0012_0FF1F0776D46E970">God. There is no &s;ecret corner&mdash;no dark retreat, where the thief and incendiary can hide from the eye of Him who knoweth all things.</P>
<P>He beholds the kindling &s;ire, which, if blown up to a flame, might con&s;ume us and our dwellings together. His good providence hath &s;aved us. To him we give thanks, that the meditated de&s;truction was di&s;covered, and that &s;ome who devi&s;ed mi&s;chief again&s;t us have been detected and confined.</P>
<P>We derive un&s;peakable con&s;olation from the a&s;&s;u|rance we have, that a Being of infinite perfection governs the world, and that he is able to counteract and fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of our mo&s;t dangerous ene|mies. To a God of infinite power and goodne&s;s we may look: on him we may place our hope in all times of danger and trouble.</P>
<P>When invaded by foes from abroad, God can fru&s;|trate their de&s;igns: He can turn their councils into fooli&s;hne&s;s: He can &s;catter them by &s;torms; and in a variety of ways prevent their executing the thing, which they may have purpo&s;ed again&s;t us. If God is, plea&s;ed to defend us, we are &s;afe; and we may hope he will be our defence, if we are careful to do the things which plea&s;e him.</P>
<P>When re&s;lle&s;s and wicked men combine for &s;editious purpo&s;es, and &s;ay in their heart, Let us break the bands of &s;ociety and ca&s;t away the cords of government, He who &s;itteth in the heavens can make them a&s;hamed, and bring the mi&s;chief which they had purpo&s;ed for others, on their own heads.</P>
<P>When contagious and mortal di&s;ea&s;es break out, and begin to &s;pread calamity and death through our
<PB N="15" REF="032358_0013_0FF1F07AF6CDC518">&s;treets, He who commandeth the winds and they blow, and governeth the &s;ea&s;ons according to his plea&s;ure, can in&s;tantly change the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, and remove the threatening evil. Fire and vapour, and all the elements, are under his control. And He who controls the winds;&mdash;He who maketh the flam|ing fire mini&s;ter to his purpo&s;es, controlleth al&s;o the <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of the children of men. <Q>He maketh the wrath of man to prai&s;e him; and the remainder of wrath he re&s;traineth.</Q> The mo&s;t vile of the crea|tion, even the bloody-minded a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, the incendiary and murderer, are under his authority: they cannot move, when he is plea&s;ed to exerci&s;e his power, to re&s;train them.</P>
<P>To men of religion, &s;uch con&s;iderations as tho&s;e which have now been &s;ugge&s;ted, are highly plea&s;ing. What can afford us more &s;olid comfort, than to be a&s;&s;ured, that all things in the heavens and on the earth, yea, all the events which have taken place, and which &s;hall take place throughout the unmea|&s;urable <HI>univer&s;e,</HI> are under the control of in&s;inite wi&s;dom, and infinire goodne&s;s!</P>
<P>Let us rejoice that the Lord reigneth; and as the government which he execi&s;eth over his rational creatures is ju&s;t and equal, let us always &s;ubmit to him. In humble obedience to his will, let us commit all our important concernments to his providence: And when the &s;cenes of time and nature &s;hall change no more, may we be admitted to tho&s;e peaceful regions, where no threatening enemy &s;hall ever come near us: where the &s;ons of anarchy and licentiou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall never di&s;turb us: where di&s;ea&s;e and death &s;hall never
<PB N="16" REF="032358_0014_0FF1F07CC13BEB00">invade us: where the flames &s;hall never reach our man&s;ions: where the incendiary and robber &s;hall never interrupt our repo&s;e. In tho&s;e peaceful regions may we unite with the general a&s;&s;embly of the wi&s;e and good, in adoring the perfections of God, and the wi&s;dom of his government, forever and ever.</P>

<P>TO whatever cau&s;e or cau&s;es it may be owing,&mdash; whether to the unu&s;ual commotions among the Euro|pean nations, and the We&s;t-India i&s;lands,&mdash;or to <HI>fal&s;e</HI> notions of liberty and equality which have been re|ceived by people void of under&s;tanding,&mdash;or to the efforts of certain modern apo&s;tles of infidelity to break down the re&s;traints of religion, and remove from the mind of man all apprehen&s;ion of an <HI>hereafter,</HI> certain it is, that the American States have of late been ex|po&s;ed to threatening and unu&s;ual calamities, from law|le&s;s and wicked men.</P>
<P><HI>Heretofore</HI> there have been but few in&s;tances of <HI>ar&s;on,</HI> or hou&s;e-burning, attended with night-robbery, in this country: But of late, in&s;tances of perpetra|ting, or of attempting to perpetrate tho&s;e crimes, have become alarming.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="032358_0017_0FF1F08C379A7388">
According to promi&s;e, and in compliance with the wi&s;hes of &s;ome of my fellow citizens, I will now give an account of &s;everal daring attempts to &s;et fire to Bo&s;ton, and rob the inhabitants. In a few notes, I will then enlarge on the <HI>Hints,</HI> in the preceding Di&s;|cour&s;e, tending to the &s;ecurity of populous towns and cities again&s;t the evils to which they are particularly expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But before I relate the attempts which have been made to &s;et fire to Bo&s;ton, I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that &s;u&s;picions have been &s;trong, that the fires which &s;pread de&s;olation through the capital of Georgia and of South-Carolina, &s;ome months ago, were the effects of wicked de&s;ign. Tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions, we are informed, have been confirmed, and &s;ome have been executed for the crime.</P>
<P>Whether the incendiaries who began at the South|ward came on towards the North; or the &s;ame evil &s;pirit has operated on wicked people, in different parts of the country, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, we cannot &s;ay.</P>
<P>There is &s;ufficient evidence that many attempts have been made (and in a number of them with fatal &s;uc|ce&s;s) to &s;et fire to buildings in New-Jer&s;ey, in New-York, in Connecticut, and in &s;everal towns in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, within the la&s;t three or four months.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in&s;tance of robbing and attempting to burn which I &s;hall mention in <HI>this town,</HI> was on the night of Feb. 22. In an adverti&s;ement in the Centinel, Mr. Marriott &s;ets forth, that his hou&s;e in Winter-&s;treet "was broken open, robbed and fired." The neigh|bours
<PB N="21" REF="032358_0018_0FF1F08E28F7F210">te&s;tify, that Mr. Marriott and his wife being from home, they &s;aw an unu&s;ual light in the chamber, and on entering the &s;ame, they found the fire had done con&s;iderable damage, and that the hou&s;e in a few minutes would have been con&s;umed, had they not given "the timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance."</P>
<P>On the &s;ame night, the &s;hop of Mr. <HI>Holmes</HI> in Union-&s;treet was broke open; and to the &s;urpri&s;e of the owner, when he entered it in the morning, he &s;aw fire had been placed on one of the &s;helves, which &s;pread &s;everal feet,&mdash;burned the wood work to a coal, and then went out.</P>
<P>On the night of the 7th of March, the hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Solomon Hewes</HI> was entered and robbed of a con&s;idera|ble &s;um of money; and on the &s;ame night the hou&s;e of Mrs. <HI>Lee</HI> was robbed of money, plate and other valuables.</P>
<P>On Sunday morning March 5th, the town was alarmed with the fire which broke out in the hou&s;e occupied by Mr. <HI>William Turner.</HI> The fire had made &s;uch progre&s;s before it was di&s;covered, that no exer|tions were &s;ufficient to &s;top its rage. In a few min|utes the building in which it was fir&s;t di&s;covered, and the elegant &s;table of the late Governor Bowdoin, were in flames. Although there were at the time &s;ome &s;u&s;picions of wicked de&s;ign, no proof could be obtained, until a <HI>black man</HI> was apprchended for anoth|er crime of the &s;ame &s;ort, in who&s;e po&s;&s;o&s;&s;ion were &s;ound &s;everal articles, the property of Mr. Turner, which were taken from his hou&s;e, on the night in which it was burned.</P>
<P>The next in&s;tance I &s;hall mention is that which took place ar the hou&s;e of Capt. Enoch Ru&s;t, in Prince-&s;treet.
<PB N="22" REF="032358_0019_0FF1F09069E4CAE0">It appeared on the trial of the criminal that the hou&s;e was violently entered between the hours of two and three in the morning. Four or five locks were bro|ken in the lower part of the hou&s;e, but as the robbers did not find all the money which they expected, one of them, with a deadly weapon in his hand, entered the lodg|ing chamber of Capt. <HI>Ru&s;t,</HI> jun. and with the threat|ening language of a murderer, demanded his money. The young gentleman, with great &s;pirit, &s;lew upon the robber, and fortunately indeed, laid him on the floor. He was &s;oon confined, has &s;ince had his trial, and is now under &s;entence of death <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was executed on the &s;ixth of April</NOTE></P>
<P>In the night of March 16th, the hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Sam|uel Gold&s;bury</HI> was broken open and robbed of &s;everal pieces of plate. The wretch who was guilty of the crime, before he left the hou&s;e, perpetrated another much more dreadful. He kindled a fire in a part, the mo&s;t convenient to communicate with the lodging chambers; and had not the inhabitants been awoke by the &s;moke, the &s;lames would &s;oon have rendered their e&s;cape impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>A <HI>black man</HI> who had &s;erved in the family was &s;u&s;|pected, and &s;earch being made, plate and other articles were found with him which had been taken, both from Mr. Gold&s;bury, and from Mr. Turner. The unhappy creature, who, it appears, had been confined for &s;ome crime in Nova-Scotia, not many months be|fore, is now fa&s;t bound in chains, and kept for the time of trial.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame night that the burglary and ar&s;on were committed in the hou&s;e of Mr. Gold&s;bury, the hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Rallion,</HI> in State-&s;treet, was entered
<PB N="23" REF="032358_0020_0FF1F09B841C9CC0">by a thief, who was taken before he could make his e&s;cape, and is al&s;o committed. On the &s;ame night a Mr. Tufts was robbed of his money, by three men, as he was pa&s;&s;ing over Winter-Hill.</P>
<P>Fire has al&s;o been &s;at to a building in Middle-&s;treet, belonging to Mrs. <HI>Beals;</HI> which having burned &s;uffi|ciently to di&s;cover the wicked de&s;ign, went out, with|out farther injury.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, for &s;everal weeks, almo&s;t every news-paper has given an account of fre&s;h in&s;tances of &s;etting fire to buildings of one kind or another, either in our neighbourhood, or in &s;ome parts of the country. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr.Williams's barns and corn hou&s;e in Roxbury were burnt on the 2d of April.</NOTE></P>
<P>The in&s;tances now mentioned, are &s;ufficient to &s;how, that &s;ome of the wor&s;t of the creation are lurking among us, and that the utmo&s;t vigilance and exertion are nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t them, and if po&s;&s;ible to detect and confine them.</P>
<P>IF any apology be nece&s;&s;ary for laying before my fellow citizens the following Notes, in addition to the Hints already given, I have only to &s;ay, they are offered with a good de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Note 1&s;t. <Q>In the pre&s;ent re&s;tle&s;s &s;tate of the world, tho&s;e who wi&s;h to live in peace, and are not par|ticularly connected with the contending powers, need be on their guard, and fortify again&s;t lawle&s;s invaders.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="032358_0021_0FF1F09F03110CA8">
The political &s;ituation of the American States at the pre&s;ent day, is peculiarly difficult. It is certainly our wi&s;dom to keep out of the quarrels of the European quarter of the world: But while tho&s;e kingdoms are angry with each other, they may not be di&s;po&s;ed to treat <HI>neutral countries</HI> with impartiality and ju&s;tice.&mdash;As God hath kindly placed us three thou&s;and miles from the pre&s;ent great theatre of quarrel, we are in no great danger of ho&s;tile armies: But &s;hould the war continue to rage, our &s;ea-ports may po&s;&s;ibly be in&s;ulted by armed crui&s;ers.</P>
<P>It &s;eems as nece&s;&s;ary that our towns and cities, near the water, &s;hould be fortified again&s;t lawle&s;s invaders, as that our hou&s;es &s;hould be barred and bolted again&s;t thieves and robbers. It is as nece&s;&s;ary that a lock &s;hould be fixed to your <HI>harbour,</HI> as to the <HI>che&s;t</HI> which contains your money:&mdash;As proper that the <HI>key</HI> &s;hould be in the hand of the &s;upreme authority, as that the key of the family trea&s;ures, be in the hand of the head of the family.</P>
<P>Note 2d. <Q>The removal of all putre&s;cent matter,&mdash; <HI>cleanline&s;s,</HI> and a free circulation of good air, are certainly among the fir&s;t things nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of health, in large towns and cities.</Q></P>
<P>It is now univer&s;ally acknowledged, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing maladies, which &s;pread de&s;olation and death through large and populous places, are oc|ca&s;ioned by the noxious vapours which the inhabitants inhale.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing therefore which requires the atten|tion of people who live in large and crowded places,
<PB N="25" REF="032358_0022_0FF1F0A0C7DA1608">in order to pre&s;erve health, is to remove as much as po&s;&s;ible, every kind of &s;ub&s;tance which tends to poi&s;on the air.</P>
<P>The atmo&s;phere in which we live, is never entirely pure: it is a compound of <HI>healthful</HI> and noxious fluids. By the laborious experiments of Dr. <HI>Prie&s;tly,</HI> Dr. <HI>Ingen-Hou&s;z,</HI> the late celebrated <HI>Lavoi&s;ier</HI> and others, it hath been demon&s;trated, that the quantity of <HI>noxious gas</HI> in the atmo&s;phere, is always much greater than the <HI>pure vital air.</HI> The proportion of <HI>noxious</HI> to the <HI>vital air,</HI> in a &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere favourable to health, is found to be as 72 to 28. On the pre&s;ervation of <HI>this proportion,</HI> or &s;omething near to it, we depend for &s;trength, for health, for &s;pirits, and life it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery of this proportion of <HI>vital air,</HI> and of <HI>noxious gas,</HI> in the atmo&s;phere which we breathe, to|gether with the means of <HI>increa&s;ing,</HI> or <HI>dimini&s;hing</HI> the one or the other, as occa&s;ion may require, are cer|tainly among the mo&s;t important di&s;coveries of mod|ern times.</P>
<P>If I can a&s;&s;i&s;t my fellow-citizens in the applica|tion of the&s;e di&s;coveries, for the purpo&s;es of prevent|ing any of the evils to which large and crowded places are particularly expo&s;ed, I &s;hall feel happy.</P>
<P>It is well known that the vapour from &s;tagnant water, particularly in hot weather, from dirty &s;treets, dead carca&s;&s;es, and all putre&s;cent bodies, is unfit for re&s;piration. Such vapours, ri&s;ing about us, and mix|ing with the air we breathe, de&s;troy the healthful pro|portion abovementioned: When the quantity of <HI>nox|ious gas</HI> is great, and long continued, it will produce
<PB N="26" REF="032358_0023_0FF1F0A7DFBA5080">&s;ome of the mo&s;t fatal di&s;orders, under which the in|habitants of large and crowded places are ever doom|ed to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>To prevent tho&s;e evils, the fir&s;t attention mu&s;t be given to <HI>cleanline&s;s.</HI> If individuals in large and crowd|ed places, neglect, or refu&s;e to remove filth from their hou&s;es and doors, e&s;pecially in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, the common &s;afety certainly will ju&s;tify the interpo&s;ition of authority.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Mitcheli,</HI> of New-York, in his ingenious and very u&s;eful <Q>attempt to a&s;certain the true nature of contagion,</Q> has the following ob&s;ervation to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e;&mdash; <Q>While puddles of putrid na&s;ti|ne&s;s, and piles of reeking dung are ince&s;&s;antly ex|haling their poi&s;onous &s;teams, that <HI>magi&s;tracy</HI> con|&s;ults very imperfectly the public health, which ne|glects the removal of &s;uch common nui&s;ances.</Q></P>
<P>As the <HI>ga&s;eous oxyd,</HI> or noxious vapour from &s;tagnant water, and the filth which is too long &s;uffered to re|main in the &s;treets and lanes of populous towns, is heavier than good air, it is di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ettle in low places: and accordingly the lowe&s;t parts of Philadelphia and of New-York, were the places where the <HI>yellow fever</HI> raged with the greate&s;t violence. In low and dirty parts of a populous town, tho&s;e fevers which are occa&s;ioned by bad air, may be always expected to put on the wor&s;t appearances.</P>
<P>Having done all in our power to prevent the in|crea&s;e of bad air, our next attention &s;hould be given to promote the increa&s;e of that which is good.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="032358_0024_0FF1F0AD7B561428">
The mo&s;t certain means for this purpo&s;e, and at the &s;ame time, the lea&s;t expen&s;ive, is to adorn the places in which we live, with <HI>thri&s;ty trees.</HI></P>
<P>Trees, during the whole time they are covered with green leaves, are found to take up, as their food, the <HI>nitrogene gas,</HI>&mdash;the corrupted air which has &s;erved the purpo&s;es of combu&s;tion,&mdash;which has pa&s;&s;ed the lungs of animals, or has been exhaled from putrid bodies; and in the kinde&s;t manner, to return &s;treams of <HI>good air,</HI> from the upper &s;urfaces of their leaves, expo&s;ed to the light of the &s;un.</P>
<P>I beg leave to fini&s;h this note with a part of the &s;peech delivered before the Royal Society of LONDON, by Sir <HI>John Pringle,</HI> at the giving a prize medal to Dr. <HI>Prie&s;tly,</HI> as an honourable te&s;timony of the appro|bation of that learned body, of the labours which he had be&s;towed on the doctrine of air.</P>
<P><Q>From the&s;e di&s;coveries, &s;ays he, we are a&s;&s;ured, that no vegetable grows in vain, but that from the oak of the fore&s;t, to the gra&s;s in the field, every in|dividual plant is &s;erviceable to mankind; if not al|ways di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome private virtue, yet mak|ing a part of the whole, which clean&s;es and purifies our atmo&s;phere. In this the fragrant ro&s;e, and deadly night-&s;hade co-operate: nor is the herbage, nor the woods that flouri&s;h in the remote and un|peopled regions, unprofitable to us, nor we to them; con&s;idering how con&s;tantly the winds convey to them <HI>our</HI> vitiated air for <HI>our</HI> relief, and for <HI>their</HI> nouri&s;hment. And, if ever the&s;e &s;alutary gales ri&s;e to &s;torms and hurricanes, let us &s;till trace, and re|vere
<PB N="28" REF="032358_0025_0FF1F0B14943FA90">the ways of a beneficent Being, who, not fortuitou&s;ly, but with de&s;ign, not in <HI>wrath,</HI> but in <HI>mercy,</HI> thus &s;hakes the waters and the air together, to bury in the deep, tho&s;e putrid and pe&s;tilential effluvia, which the vegetables upon the face of the earth, had been in&s;ufficient to con&s;ume.</Q></P>
<P>Note 3d. <Q>As towns and cities increa&s;e in popula|tion and wealth, it is found nece&s;&s;ary that the gov|ernment be more vigorous, and that it it proceed with more firmne&s;s and di&s;patch, than in the earlier &s;tages of &s;ociety.</Q></P>
<P>The truth of this ob&s;ervation cannot be called in que&s;tion. Populous towns and cities, will find, by ex|perience, the nece&s;&s;ity of changing or improving their <HI>police,</HI> as their circum&s;tances alter: Tho&s;e regulations which an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of &s;mall villages and coun|try towns, will be found in&s;ufficient for large commer|cial places, e&s;pecially when they become the re&s;ort of foreigners, bringing with them the habits of different nations, of different modes of education, and of differ|ent religions.</P>
<P>A great part of the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, I believe, are convinced that the government of the town wants energy, and that the <HI>police</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed by our venera|ble fathers, may be improved to advantage.</P>
<P>Some new regulations are wanting, or additional force and &s;pirit given to &s;uch as have been already made, to prevent the evils we &s;uffer from <HI>vagrants,</HI> &s;trolling <HI>mendicants,</HI> and people of &s;u&s;picious, and of bad char|acter.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="032358_0026_0FF1F0B31747DE90">
A complete remedy of the evils now mentioned, can be expected in nothing &s;hort of the <HI>confinement</HI> of per&s;ons, of the above de&s;cription, in &s;ome place of puni&s;hment or indu&s;try, where they &s;hall be prevented doing mi&s;chief, and if po&s;&s;ible, be obliged to earn their living.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hing relief given to the city of <HI>Munich,</HI> by our countryman Sir <HI>Benjamin Thomp&s;on,</HI> now <HI>Count of Rumford,</HI> when it was infe&s;ted with a multitude of impudent mendicants, and people of the mo&s;t vicious character, is &s;ufficient to &s;how what may be done; and to encourage like attempts in other parts of the world.</P>
<P>A hou&s;e of <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> was provided, with &s;uitable ac|commodations and employments; and under the di|rection of that enterpri&s;ing and benevolent officer, <HI>Munich</HI> was, in one day, delivered from 1200 mi&s;era|ble creatures, &s;unk in vice, and pe&s;ts of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Nor will the expen&s;e of &s;uch an enterpri&s;e, as that which was carried into execution by <HI>Benjamin, Count of Rumford,</HI> to put an end to the evils of <HI>mendicity</HI> in Bavaria, be at all di&s;couraging, when it is con&s;idered, that he prepared a very whole&s;ome kind of food for 1200 people in the hou&s;e of indu&s;try, for &pound; 1.7.6. per day, which is but a little over <HI>one farthing</HI> for each per&s;on; and by a great improvement in the con&s;truc|tion of the kitchen fire-place, the fuel nece&s;&s;ary to cook food for 1000 people does not co&s;t more than <HI>four pence half penny.</HI></P>
<P>What has been done by <HI>Count Rumford</HI> in Bavaria, may be done in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="032358_0027_0FF1F0B51F2E3938">
Conceive now of the relief we &s;hould experience from an in&s;titution &s;imilar to that which we have been con&s;idering!&mdash;Such in&s;titutions in our large towns and cities, would go far to prevent the evils which we &s;uffer from <HI>idle</HI> and <HI>vicious</HI> per&s;ons, who are con&s;tant|ly &s;trolling about, and of late, have &s;pread alarm both in town and country.</P>
<P>Such an in&s;titution, executed with &s;pirit, and accom|panied with a frequent <HI>return</HI> to an office of <HI>police,</HI> of the names of all per&s;ons who put up at lodging hou&s;es, and hou&s;es of entertainment of every de&s;cription, to|gether with the general &s;tate of the &s;everal wards into which the town now is, or may be conveniently divided, would do more towards our &s;ecurity again&s;t <HI>thieves</HI> and <HI>incendiaries,</HI> than the <HI>nightly watch</HI> and <HI>patrol</HI> of a large number of the inhabitants.</P>
