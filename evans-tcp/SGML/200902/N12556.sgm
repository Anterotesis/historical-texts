<P>THE public will naturally be inqui&s;itive as to the authenticity of the following letters. For every thing el&s;e, they will &s;peak for them&s;elves: and, for their genuinene&s;s, the Editor conceives him&s;elf con|cerned to give only &s;uch vouchers as he him&s;elf has received. By the la&s;t pacquet he was &s;avoured with a letter from a friend, now &s;erving in a loyal corps under Brigadier-General De Lancey of New-York, of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e here &s;ubjoins a faithful extract. Plea&s;ed with the communication him&s;elf (and, as he is not a&s;hamed to add, in&s;tructed by it) he could not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;y to withhold it from the public at large: ina&s;|much as, in his judgment, it exhibits a fairer and ful|ler view of American politics, than the world has yet &s;een.</P>
<P>&mdash; "Among the pri&s;oners at Fort-Lee, I e&s;pied a mulatto fellow, whom I thought I recol|lected, and who confirmed my conjectures by gazing very earne&s;tly at me. I a&s;ked him, if he knew me. At fir&s;t, he was unwilling to own it; but, when he was about to be carried off, thinking, I &s;uppo&s;e, that I might, perhaps, be of &s;ome &s;ervice to him, he came and told me, that he was Billy, and the old &s;ervant of General Wa&s;hington. He had been left there on account of an indi&s;po&s;ition which prevented his attending his ma&s;ter. I a&s;ked him a great many que&s;|tions,

as you may &s;uppo&s;e; but found very little &s;atisfaction in his an&s;wers. At la&s;t, however, he told me that he had a &s;mall portmanteau of his ma&s;ter's; of which, when he found that he mu&s;t be put into confinement, he intreated my care. It contained only a few &s;tockings and &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rts; and I could &s;ee nothing worth my care, except an Almanack, in which he had kept a &s;ort of a journal, or diary of his proceedings &s;ince his fir&s;t coming to New-York: there were al&s;o two letters from his lady, one from Mr. Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">is, and &s;ome pretty long ones from a Mr Lund Wa&s;hington. And in the &s;ame bundle with them, the fir&s;t draughts, or foul copies, of an&s;wers to them. I read the&s;e with avidity; and being highly entertained with them, have &s;hewn them to &s;everal of my friends, who all agree with me, that he is a very different character from what they had &s;uppo&s;ed him. I never knew a man &s;o much to be pitied. If I remember right, you have &s;een, and have &s;ome knowledge of him; but it is impo&s;&s;ible you could form &s;o ju&s;t an e&s;timate of him, as the&s;e letters will give you. They contain al&s;o, as you will find, a deal of information, not to be had any where el&s;e: I a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf therefore, you will thank me for the trouble I have taken in copy|ing them for your peru&s;al."</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR LUND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I wrote to you but a very few days ago, and have nothing new of much moment to communicate, I cannot deny my&s;elf the comfort of unburthening my mind to you, whenever I have a little lei&s;ure, amid the thou&s;and anxieties and di&s;|quietudes that almo&s;t di&s;tract me. I know the good|ne&s;s of your heart, and that you will attend to me with indulgence&punc; and &s;ympathy, though it be not in your power any otherwi&s;e to afford me relief. There

cannot, in the nature of things, be a &s;ituation &s;o truly irk&s;ome to an ingenuous mind, as the being perpetu|ally obliged to act a part foreign to our true feelings; yet this alas! as you know, is, and mu&s;t be my lot. I wear a countenance dre&s;&s;ed in the calm &s;erenity of perfect confidence, whil&s;t my heart is corroded with infinite apprehen&s;ions, and I have no bo&s;om friend near me, to whom I dare lay it open. Tell me Lund, for you have long been privy to my mo&s;t &s;e|cret thoughts,&mdash;tru&s;ting to thy native candour, I have never he&s;itated to lay my heart bare and open to thy in&s;pection; tell me then, am I, do you think, more &s;ubject to fears than other men? For I will not con|ceal it from you, that, at this moment, I feel my&s;elf a very coward. Do not mi&s;take me&mdash;I thank my God, I have never yet known what it was to fear for any per&s;onal danger that might befal me. I am not afraid to die &mdash; why &s;hould I? I am afraid only to die with infamy and di&s;grace. And, if I am afraid &s;o to die, need I tell you that I am ten thou|&s;and times more afra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to live, like Lucifer, a fallen Angel. No, Lund, that were too much; betide what will, I cannot, and I will not, &s;urvive either my misfortunes, or my di&s;graces. Heaven, knows how truly I love my country; and that I embarked in this arduous enterprize on the pure&s;t motives. But we have over&s;hot our mark: we have gra&s;ped at things beyond our reach: it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould &s;ucceed; and, I cannot with truth, &s;ay that I am &s;orry for it; becau&s;e I am far from being &s;ure that we de&s;erve to &s;ucceed. That the Briti&s;h Mini|&s;try had meditated &s;chemes fatal to the liberties of America; and that, if we had not oppo&s;ed their fir&s;t efforts to impo&s;e taxes upon us, without our con&s;ent, we might have bid adieu to every idea of con&s;titutio|nal &s;ecurity hereafter, I have not a doubt. Nay, I am &s;o thoroughly per&s;uaded of the unworthine&s;s of their de&s;igns, and of the duty of every hone&s;t American to oppo&s;e them, that, di&s;&s;atisfied as I am with my &s;itu|ation, were it to do over again, I would rather be even as I am than tamely crouch, whil&s;t chains were fa&s;tening round my neck. For there is not in my

e&s;timation, &s;o vile a thing upon earth as a human being who, having once enjoyed liberty, can patiently be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r to &s;ee it taken from him. I would, and I will die ten thou&s;and deaths, rather than be this thing my&s;elf. On the&s;e principles, and the&s;e only, I fir&s;t took up arms; but my misfortune, and the true &s;ource of all my unea&s;ine&s;s is, that though in good policy, as well as honour, the&s;e ought to be the prin|ciples of every American, I have long ago di&s;cover|ed they are not. And on this account alone, that I dread our defeat. Our want of &s;kill, our want of am|munition, in &s;hort, our want of every thing which an army ought to have, are all, no doubt, exceedingly again&s;t us: but, they are all nothing to our want o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> virtue.&mdash;Unu&s;ed to the many arts and devices, by which de&s;igning men carry their points, I unwillingly li&s;tened to my own apprehen&s;ions, when early in the fir&s;t Congre&s;s, I thought I &s;aw a tendency to mea&s;ures which I never could approve of. I rea&s;oned my&s;elf, however, out of my fears, with no ordinary reproach on my own meanne&s;s, in having given way to &s;u&s;pi|cions, which could not be true, unle&s;s we had men among&s;t our&s;elves more flagitious than even tho&s;e we were oppo&s;ing. At length, however, when a conti|nental army came to be voted for, my fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s returned with redoubled force: for then, for the fir&s;t time, I clearly &s;aw our aims reached farther than we cared to avow. It was carried with an unanimity that re|ally a&s;toni&s;hed me; becau&s;e I knew many wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oted for it, were as aver&s;e to the independency of Ame|rica, as I was. And they even ridiculed me for my apprehen&s;ions on that account: and, indeed, when they &s;ugge&s;ted that Great-Britain, &s;eeing us appa|rently determined to ri&s;que every thing rather than that they &s;hould tax us, would never think of en|gaging in a civil war with us, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily co&s;t her more than even America could repay her, I could not but hope, that I was mi&s;taken; and that our military preparations might be a good political movement. In one thing, however, we all agreed, that, as the forces were chiefly to be rai&s;ed in New-England, it would be extremely ra&s;h and imprudent
<PB N="5" REF="015868_0006_0F9A2FF150FB4E28">
in the &s;outhern delegates to leave them in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o formidable a power without any check. I need not tell you, that it was this con&s;ideration which, if I am to be credited, &s;orely again&s;t my will, deter|mined me to accept of the command of this army. We &s;et out with bad omens&punc; I was mi&s;tru&s;tful of them in every thing; and they were taught to look upon me with jealou&s;y. This &s;oon mani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ted it&s;elf in forming them to any thing like decent di&s;cipline. But I have, long ago, pe&s;tered you more than enough with complaints on this head. I knew not, however, certainly, that I had been appointed to this high &s;ta|tion only to be di&s;graced and ruined, till about the middle and latter end of la&s;t February: when contrary to my wi&s;hes, I found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould come to open ho&s;tilities again&s;t our fellow &s;ub|jects in the mini&s;terial army: doubtle&s;s, common pru|dence required that when we did attempt it, we &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, do it &s;peedily and effectually. And, hav|ing all the rea&s;on in the world to believe that large armies would be &s;ent again&s;t us early in the &s;ummer, I re&s;olved, co&s;t what it would, to cut off tho&s;e already here, which would have given us &s;uch infinite advan|tages over any future reinforcements that might be &s;ent. And this I believed was ea&s;ily in our power; but, as I have already told you, noth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng is to be done with our New-England allies, unle&s;s they are let into all your &s;ecrets. I could not advance a &s;tep with|out communicating my intentions to the gentlemen in the civil department; a thing even ruinous in war. It &s;oon got wind, as I had fore&s;een; and it appeared, that the General of the enemy was appri&s;ed of my de&s;ign. Still, however, I per&s;evered in my purpo|&s;es; which in &s;pite of all his care and caution, I was confident mu&s;t &s;ucceed, and reduce him to the utmo&s;t extremity. But (as every military man mu&s;t know) &s;o capital a blow was not to be &s;truck without the lo&s;s both of many men, and much property; for my de|&s;ign was, if they would not &s;urrender by an honoura|ble capitulation, to burn the town about their ears, and &s;o ru&s;h in, and cut them off in their attempts
<PB N="6" REF="015868_0007_0F9A2FF20F5C6750">
to e&s;cape to the &s;hips. And this, with our &s;uperi|ority of numbers, we certainly could have effected though, no doubt, it would have been a bloody bu&s;i|ne&s;s, if they had not &s;urrendered, as I think they would. But when, as I was obliged, I laid this be|fore the Council and Repre&s;entatives, they not only found a thou&s;and objections to it but ab&s;olutely re|&s;trained me and I could not have got a man that would have gone on what they called &s;o de&s;perate a &s;cheme. Hence was I under a nece&s;&s;ity of proceeding in that poor, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w, and un&s;oldier-like manner, which not only gave them an opportunity to e&s;cape, but has taught them to de&s;pi&s;e us. There is no forming an idea of the importance of &s;uch a &s;troke at that con|juncture. If any thing upon earth could have made America independent and glorious, that was the gol|den opportunity. I confe&s;s to you, I had worked my imagination up to &s;uch a pitch of high expectation, that my di&s;appointment has di&s;pirited me in a manner I never can recover. For, from that moment, I have de&s;paired of our ever doing any thing truly great. Any little gleams of &s;ucce&s;s, or fairer pro&s;pects we have &s;ince had, &s;erve but to make our inferiority the more con&s;picuous. For what incidents can fall out to ag|grandize us, who can be made great only by great and &s;pirited efforts, when we have &s;hewn that we want|ed both the under&s;tanding and the virtue to purcha&s;e to our&s;elves immortal glory on better and cheaper terms than ever we can hope hereafter to have it? But, the wor&s;t remains yet to be told. Some of tho&s;e very men who were the mo&s;t forward to thwart me in this mea&s;ure, had di&s;covered a different way of thinking on other occa&s;ions, and, I am pur&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed that were the que&s;tion put to them now, as t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this city, and the &s;outhern regiments, I &s;hould not hear a di&s;|&s;enting voice. But let me &s;pare you.</P>
<P>After all this, you will again, I doubt not, as you often have, a&s;k why I continue in a &s;ituation &s;o di&s;|agreeable to me? I wi&s;h you had forborne this que&s;|tion, the truth being, that I neither am able, nor very willing to an&s;wer it. My re&s;olution to hold it out as
<PB N="7" REF="015868_0008_0F9A2FF2D06AC628">
long as I can is dictated by my feelings, which I neither can de&s;cribe to you, nor wholly ju&s;tify on paper; but which, however, I find it impo&s;&s;ible for me to di&s;regard. The eyes of all America, perhaps, of Europe, of the world are fixed on me. It has been our policy, (and, at the time, I thought it well founded) to hold out fal&s;e lights to the world. There are not a hundred men in America that know our true &s;ituation; three fourths of the Congre&s;s it&s;elf are ignorant of it; your|&s;elf excepted, their lives not a man at all acquainted with my peculiar circum&s;tances. The world looks up|on us as in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an army all animated with the pure flame of liberty, and determined to die ra|ther than not be free. It is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of proofs, that it is &s;o, under my own hand: I have always &s;o &s;poken of it and I &s;till do. But, you know how remote in my judgment all this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the truth; though I am not &s;ure that that there is another man in the army, be&s;ides my&s;elf, that thinks &s;o. I &s;hould gue&s;s, however, that there are many. But, tied up as my own mouth is, it is little to be wondered at that theirs are &s;o too, at lea&s;t to me.</P>
<P>&mdash;Thus circum&s;tanced, can you point out a way in which it is po&s;&s;ible for me to re&s;ign, ju&s;t now as it were, on the eve of action, without the imputa|tion of cowardice? There is no &s;uch way. Be&s;ides, diffident and de&s;ponding as I am, how do I know, that it is not &s;o with tho&s;e we have to oppo&s;e? they certainly have rea&s;on. The events of war depend on a thou&s;and minu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a, without the ken of a mere by|&s;tander. I know not that the commander of the ar|mies of the low-countries, could his heart have been read as you do mine, had not the &s;ame fears, and the &s;ame cau&s;es for them that I have. You learn not this from the hi&s;tory; nor was it to be expected you &s;hould. Yet, he &s;ucceeded at la&s;t. And, who knows, what an over-ruling Providence, who often brings about the greate&s;t revolutions by the mo&s;t unlikely means, may intend for America? If it be the will of God, that America &s;hould be independent of Great-Britain, and that this be the &s;ea&s;on for it, even I and the&s;e unhope|ful

men around may not be thought unworthy in&s;tru|ments in his hands. And, &s;hould we &s;ucceed, we are heroes, and immortalized beyond even tho&s;e of for|mer times. Whereas di&s;grace only, and intolerable infamy await our retreat. In this per&s;ua&s;ion, I re&s;olve to go on, contented, with the glorious King William, to &s;ave my country, or die in the la&s;t ditch.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY VERY DEAR JACK,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have exceedingly obliged me by your letter which I received by ye&s;terday's po&s;t. It di&s;|covers an attention to the great affairs now carrying on, and an information concerning them, which I own to you I had not given you credit for. Your youth and inexperience pleaded your excu&s;e: and though you gave me no opportunity to prai&s;e you for any active ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtions, I paid you no ordinary compli|ments, in my own mind, for your mode&s;ty in forbear|ing to meddle with things which it was no reproach to you to confe&s;s, were out of your reach. Con&s;ider|ing your rank, fortune, and education, whenever it is proper for you to come forward on the theatre, it mu&s;t not be any underpart that you act. You are, therefore, certainly, in the right to decline taking any part at all, till you are fit for a fir&s;t and leading cha|racter. And you have my full and perfect approba|tion of your re&s;olution to per&s;i&s;t in your purpo&s;e, for the pre&s;ent, not to accept of any rank civil or military.
<PB N="9" REF="015868_0010_0F9A2FF450439AD0">
I &s;ee your anxiety, left the pre&s;ent opportunity for &s;ignalizing your ju&s;t love for your country &s;hould, by your not unnece&s;&s;ary cautions, be &s;uffered to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lip by you, unimproved. Your ardour is commendable; and far be it from me to di&s;courage in you a &s;pirit I &s;o much love. But, whil&s;t you retrain the&s;e honour|able principles, there is little danger of your wanting opportunities to call them forth into action. The momentous enterprize, in which your country is en|gaged is not to be accompli&s;hed in this or that year. If, in no longer a period than the &s;iege of Troy, we bring all our mighty &s;chemes to bear, it will be the greate&s;t work that ever was perfected in &s;o little a time. You have &s;et your heart, you tell me, on a mi|litary employment. This is the u&s;ual bent of young men; and, as it was my own, it will be with an ill grace that I reprehend it in you. But with the ex|perience that I have had of it, I &s;hould be wanting in that love and e&s;teem I owe you, &s;hould I he&s;itate to tell you that, as your Father, there is not a profe&s;&s;ion you could have cho&s;en in which I &s;hould not more cordially have concurred with you. Yet, I love arms; I am married to my &s;word, as well as to your mo&s;t amiable mother: and, herein is my witne&s;s, that I am in earne&s;t when I &s;ay, death alone &s;hall divorce me from either. I am not &s;o blindly devoted, how|ever, to my profe&s;&s;ion, as not to &s;ee by how frail a tenure I hold the little reputation I have in it. As a &s;tate&s;man, as a &s;enator, it is in the general, &s;ufficient that you mean well, that you are careful to qualify your&s;elf to form a right judgment of the true intere&s;ts of your country, and that, with the hone&s;t impartiality of a free man, you have &s;till exerted your be&s;t endea|vours to promote tho&s;e intere&s;ts. But, with a &s;oldier, &s;ucce&s;s alone is merit; and there is nothing that can atone for the want of it. The world is a wor&s;e judge military of matters, than any other. It would a&s;toni&s;h you, to find, on a minute compari&s;on, how very lit|tle difference there was in the &s;kill and &s;pirit which guided Braddock and Wolfe in the la&s;t actions of their lives. But, how different has been their fate!&mdash; I think, I am not without &s;ome talents for the line
<PB N="10" REF="015868_0011_0F9A2FF50FC936C8">
of life which has fallen to my lot. But, oppo&s;ed as I mu&s;t be by men, probably, of infinitely &s;uperior &s;kill, and encompa&s;&s;ed moreover with &s;uch ho&s;ts of other difficulties and di&s;couragements as I am, it is not mine to command &s;ucce&s;s. And when either my cotempo|raries, or future hi&s;torians, &s;hall &s;it in judgment on my conduct, if, haply, ill fortune &s;hould overtake me, &s;eeing our mi&s;carriages, only, and having neither curi|o&s;ity nor ability to inve&s;tigate the thou&s;and cau&s;es which led to them, am I not too well warranted in concluding, that they will be attributed to mi&s;manage|ment? Have I not then rea&s;on to wi&s;h that your choice had fallen on the quieter but not le&s;s important calling of a private gentleman; in which, as a &s;enator, you might have given proof of your abilities, in a way in which fortune would not have had &s;o great a &s;hare? But notwith&s;tanding all this, and if after all, you be irrevocably determined to try your fortune in the field, and you can gain your mothers and your wife's con&s;ent, I here give it you under my hand, that you &s;hall not want mine. Mo&s;t certainly there cannot be a more honorable employment: and if (which Heaven avert) Fortune &s;hould declare again&s;t you, my con&s;o|lation will be, than I can a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf, you will de|&s;erve to be &s;ucce&s;sful. I will, on the opening of the next campaign, procure you an appointment to the command of a regiment, either here, or in the &s;outhern wing. And, if my opinion may have any weight with you, you will, for many rea&s;ons, prefer the being &s;ta|tioned in &s;ome of the &s;outhern &s;tates. There is no fear of its being an inactive &s;tation. I have little expec|tation that this year will clo&s;e with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aught con&s;idera|bly deci&s;ive on either &s;ide: and if our enemies be able to hold out another campaign, it is mo&s;t likely their policy will be, by means of their naval &s;uperiority, to carry on a kind of an incur&s;ive war, by making unexpected de&s;cents in different and di&s;tant places. Mean while, permit me to pre&s;s you to pre&s;evere in your attention to military matters. The manual ex|erci&s;e, which you were &s;o ju&s;tly diligent to learn, whil&s;t I was with you, is but the A, B, C, of your profe&s;&s;ion. Neither will you profit &s;o much as you

might rea&s;onably expect, from the &s;tudy of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e authors, who have written profe&s;&s;edly on the art of war. This is like the learning the game of Whi&s;t by reading Hoyle. I have been witne&s;s to the mi&s;|chievous effects of it. A man, book-learned only, does very well in the &s;till &s;cenes of marchings and encampments. But when, in the various bu&s;tles of actual war, a cau&s;e ari&s;es, as mu&s;t often be the ca&s;e, not de&s;cribed in his books, he is utterly at a lo&s;s. I would not, however, have you to under&s;tand me as if I meant to di&s;courage your reading the&s;e books, at all, &s;o far from it, I would have you read them very often, and make your&s;elf acquainted with the &s;ubject as much as you can, in theory My caution meant only to guard you again&s;t placing too much reliance on them. Their be&s;t commentators, next to your own experience, will be the hi&s;torians of Greece and Rome; which it is your happine&s;s to be able to read in the originals. But, the main and mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial qualification is an high &s;en&s;e of honour, an ele|vation of &s;entiment, and a certain dignified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tile of behaviour, that di&s;tingui&s;hes, or &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h, a &s;oldier from every other man. It is a &s;hame in|deed, if he who undertakes to command others, has not fir&s;t learned to command him&s;elf: I will not en|dure any thing mean or &s;ordid either in your prin|ciples, or your manners; having determined, if it were left with me, to be as a &s;trict and rigorous in the&s;e particulars, as were the knights of old, when a candidate was to be inve&s;ted with the orders of chivalry. I cannot di&s;&s;ociate the ideas between a &s;oldier and a gentleman: and however common it may be to give that la&s;t appellation to per&s;ons of every character, it yet conveys to me an idea of worths I want words to expre&s;s. I am not &s;olicitous to pay you compliments, even by implication; but, I may certainly be permitted to &s;ay, that if I had not known you to be a gentleman, you never &s;hould have had my con&s;ent to your becoming a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>Your ob&s;ervations on this important conte&s;t are ju&s;t and accurate, and di&s;cover a reach of thought, and a
<PB N="12" REF="015868_0013_0F9A2FF68FC644E0">
penetration beyond what I had expected of you. What you &s;ay on the &s;ubject of independency is per|fectly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">udicious, and, no doubt, highly worthy of all our mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration. Yet, I have a prae|&s;entiment, that it will take place, and &s;peedily. Open and unre&s;erved as my conduct towards you has ever been, I have no reluctance to confe&s;s to you, that the mea&s;ure is diametrically oppo&s;ite to my judgment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, for I have not yet de&s;paired of an honorable recon|ciliation; and whil&s;t I can entertain but an hope of that, both intere&s;t and inclination lead me to prefer it to every thing el&s;e upon earth. Human affairs are oddly ordered: To obtain what you mo&s;t wi&s;h for, you mu&s;t often make u&s;e of means you the lea&s;t approve of.</P>
<P>As in bargaining, to obtain a fair and equal price, you mu&s;t frequently a&s;k more than you wi&s;h to take. I do not really wi&s;h for independence. I hope there are few who do; but, I have never heard the rea&s;on|ings of tho&s;e, who have proved that, if we did not declare for it, we &s;hould fail to obtain the con&s;titu|tional &s;ubordination to which we are entitled, fairly refuted. I would not have you, therefore, ha&s;tily conclude that if, in this &s;truggle, we fall &s;hort of every thing we have claimed; we are wor&s;ted: perhaps, the very wor&s;t thing that could befal us, is that we &s;hould gain all. I do a&s;&s;ure you that, in my opinion, the next misfortune to that of being thru&s;t from our ju&s;t rank in the order of freemen, would be the giv|ing us up, and leaving us to our&s;elves. But, this Great-Britain will never do, voluntarily: for, if even &s;he does, whatever may become of us, from that moment, &s;he may date the commencement of her own downfall.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly happy in the becoming modera|tion which you ob&s;erve and endeavour to introduce towards the unhappy men who&s;e political creeds differ from ours. But for this blot in her &s;cutcheon, thrown on her by too many of her ra&s;h and unwor|thy advocates, by a contrary conduct, this effort of America would have done her honour, even though &s;he had failed. I am &s;hocked at the in&s;tances of in|tollerance
<PB N="13" REF="015868_0014_0F9A2FF7CA269260">
I daily hear of, and have no power to prevent. But, like the other evils of war, it is a calamity that unavoidably grows out of &s;uch a con|vul&s;ion; and one might as well hope to &s;tem the fury of a torrent, as to give laws to an enraged people. It is, however, the duty of every true friend to liber|ty, by every gentle and conciliatory means in his power, to re&s;train it. And, I am happy to find this &s;entiment daily becoming more general among&s;t us. All things con&s;idered, I cannot but think it not a lit|tle to our honour that things have not been carried to a &s;till greater heighth in this way.</P>
<P>Remember me affectionately to Nelly, and tell her that though I &s;hould be happy to &s;ee her, I may not hope for that happine&s;s &s;peedily: as the din of arms, I imagine, would be but unplea&s;ing entertainment to her; and I have little pro&s;pect of any lei&s;ure, at lea&s;t before we go into winter quarters. I hope Mr. Calvert, and all the family are well: I beg to be remembered to them. I will write to your mother in a few days. You are very good in leaving her alone as little as may be. Continue to write to me frequently, freely, and fully: the hearing of my deare&s;t friends and family's welfare being the only true happine&s;s I have any chance to enjoy amid&s;t the perpetual hurry in which I live.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Lund,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are &s;till going on with all imaginable bri&s;k|ne&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s with our works, which, I think are already impregnable. It would really a&s;toni&s;h you to &s;ee the progre&s;s we have made. I do not believe that all hi&s;tory can furni&s;h a precedent of &s;o much being done in &s;o little time, or in &s;o ma&s;terly a manner, where you had &s;o little right to look for con&s;ummate &s;kill. If in every thing el&s;e, we could but come up to our exertions in the&s;e fortifications, I &s;hould hardly know how to doubt the judgment of tho&s;e who think that we may bid defiance to the world. But, I know not how it is, I am diffident of every thing. Whil&s;t almo&s;t every body el&s;e &s;eem to have per&s;uaded them&s;elves, that we have nothing to fear, I alone torment my&s;elf with thinking that every thing is again&s;t us. Even from the&s;e very works, which have in&s;pired us with &s;uch confidence, I anticipate only misfortune and di&s;grace. By this time the die is ca&s;t, and America is authoritatively declared free and independent; and unle&s;s we can be contented to appear ridiculous in the eyes of all the world, we mu&s;t re&s;olve to &s;upport this declara|tion by a &s;uitable conduct;&mdash;we mu&s;t fight our way to freedom and independency; for in no other way, &s;hall we be permitted to obtain it, farther than words.</P>
<P>A war, therefore, and a mo&s;t &s;erious one, is now inevitable. Next to good finances, which it is not my province to provide for, a good army is, doubt|le&s;s, a main requi&s;ite to the carrying on a &s;ucce&s;sful war. And a good army, is by no means &s;ecured, as &s;ome &s;eem to reckon, by &s;ecuring a large number of men. We want &s;oldiers, and between the&s;e, and raw, undi&s;ciplined men, there is a wide difference.
<PB N="15" REF="015868_0016_0F9A2FF8D0B924A8">
The que&s;tion then is, how are the&s;e raw and undi&s;|ciplined men to be formed into good &s;oldiers? And I am free to give it as my opinion, that &s;o far from contributing to this, will &s;trong holds, fortified po&s;ts, and deep intrenchments be found, that they will have a direct contrary effect. To be a &s;oldier, is to be inured to, and familiar with danger; to dare to look your enemy in the face, un&s;heltered and expo|&s;ed to their fire, and even when repul&s;ed, to rally again with undimini&s;hed &s;pirit. The Indian maxim i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that it is equally your duty to take care of your|&s;elf, and to annoy your enemy. To a General, this may not be an unu&s;ual caution; but I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that whenever a private centinel allows him&s;elf to act on this principle, the odds are, that, in the moment of trial, in his exceeding &s;olicitude not to forget the former, the latter will be but little at|tended to. Now, what I a&s;k, are all the&s;e mighty ditches and brea&s;t-works, but &s;o many le&s;&s;ons and admonitions to our men of what prodigious impor|tance it is to take care of them&s;elves? It would be almo&s;t worth our while to be defeated, if it were only to train us to &s;tand fire, and to bear a rever&s;e of fortune with a decent magnanimity. If it had not been for this ill-judged humour of fighting from be|hind a &s;creen, the 19th of April and 17th of June la&s;t year, might have been the happie&s;t days Ame|rica ever &s;aw. All the&s;e things have I, again and again, repre&s;ented to my ma&s;ters; I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay, to how little purpo&s;e. They return me an&s;wers and in&s;tructions, which, though I cannot refute, have not yet convinced what I would call the feelings of my own mind.</P>
<P>This day week, the enemy's fleet was fir&s;t de&s;cri|ed off Sandy-Hook. They have been employed &s;ince then in debarking their troops on Staten-I&s;land, where they are cantoned, as far as I can judge, in a very uncompact and unguarded manner. I cannot exactly a&s;certain their number, but I have rea&s;on to believe, that they fall &s;hort of &s;even thou&s;and. It is more extraordinary &s;till, that I am not able to inform you of the exact number of forces under my own
<PB N="16" REF="015868_0017_0F9A2FF98FE3AC38">
command: I fancy however, we might bring into the field, at this place, double their number at a minute's warning; and with this &s;uperiority of num|bers, making all po&s;&s;ible allowances for our other di&s;advantages, one would hope we might be able to give a good account of them. You, who are &s;an|guine in the extreme, and all impatience, will eager|ly a&s;k, why we &s;uffered them to land unmole&s;ted, and to remain &s;o ever &s;ince. What excellent expeditions your fire-&s;ide generals can in&s;tantly plan and execute! But you forget that they are po&s;ted on an i&s;land, and that we have no way at coming at them unle&s;s they would lend us their &s;hips and boats, which I have not pre&s;umed to a&s;k of them. Aware, however, of the importance of falling on them, whil&s;t there is a chance of doing it with &s;ucce&s;s, and e're they become a match for us, by reinforcements, which they daily expect, I have formed a &s;cheme, which, at lea&s;t, is plau&s;ible, and promi&s;es fair to be &s;ucce&s;sful. I have &s;ubmitted it to Congre&s;s, and every moment expect their an&s;wer; and if they will but &s;upport me with alacrity, and in good earne&s;t, my next, I tru&s;t will not be &s;o de&s;ponding. I expect to be all ready to put my plan in execution on Tue&s;day, or at farthe&s;t, on Wedne&s;day night; &s;o that probably, at the very moment you are reading this, we may be engaged in a very different &s;ervice. You will, no doubt, be im|patient to hear from me as &s;oon as may be after Wedne&s;day, and I will not di&s;appoint you. Mean|while, I &s;hall not need to tell you, that end how it will, all that I freely chatter to you, is to remain a profound &s;ecret to every body el&s;e.</P>
<P>Doctor, now Brigadier General Mercer is here, and is a great comfort to me. Like my&s;elf, he wants experience; but he is very &s;hrewd and &s;en&s;ible, and though a Scot&s;man, is remarkably humane and libe|ral. I have communicated the whole of my de&s;ign to him alone; and am not a&s;hamed to own, that I have received much a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him. I know not how it may turn out; but though neither he nor I are very apt to be &s;anguine, we have both confe&s;&s;ed to be &s;o on this occa&s;ion. Animated, however, as I feel my|&s;elf

with the near pro&s;pect of at length doing &s;ome|thing, not unworthy the high rank to which I am rai&s;ed, I own to you, I take a &s;erious plea&s;ure in it, only as it flatters me with the hope of thereby ob|taining a &s;pedier and happier peace. Let us, &s;ince war mu&s;t be our lot, di&s;tingui&s;h our&s;elves as freemen &s;hould, in fields of blood, &s;till remembering, however, that we fight not for conque&s;t, but for liberty.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR LUND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW cruelly are all my hopes in one &s;ad moment bla&s;ted and de&s;troyed! I am po&s;itively ordered to wait for the enemy in our lines; and le&s;t I &s;hould be made enough not to obey their mandates, not a &s;ingle tittle of any thing I had a&s;ked for, is granted. Thus has a &s;econd opportunity of rendering my country an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, in the way of my pro|fe&s;&s;ion, been unwi&s;ely, and in the mo&s;t mortifying manner denied me. I profe&s;s, I hardly know how to bear it: having to regret not only, that two op|portunities, &s;uch as may never again occur, have been &s;uffered to pa&s;s by us unimproved, but that none can happen, we can improve. Managed as matters are, we neither are, nor ever &s;hall be a mili|tary people; and yet, in the train in which things are now put, unle&s;s we are, it were idioti&s;m to hope for either freedom or independence.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="015868_0019_0F9A2FFB0FEA7298">I remember well, in a conver&s;ation I once had with a friend, now mo&s;t unju&s;tly as well as unwi&s;e|ly, driven from his friends and his home, on the &s;ubject of monarchies and republics, he objected to the unavoidable &s;lowne&s;s and dilatorine&s;s of the exe|cutive power in the latter. Aiming to an&s;wer him in his own way, I replied that, if popular councils were &s;low, they yet were &s;ure, and that in the multi|tude of coun&s;ellors there is &s;afety. His an&s;wer was prophetical If ever (he &s;aid) we of the&s;e countries &s;hould ra&s;hly put the&s;e things to the proof, it would be found that, however true this adage might be in the cabinet, it was not &s;o in the field. Convinced, by melancholy experience, that this is the ca&s;e, and, that without &s;ome different &s;y&s;tem, we &s;hall but ex|po&s;e our&s;elves to contempt and ruin, I re&s;olve this evening hone&s;tly &amp; openly to &s;ay &s;o to the Congre&s;s. I will go farther, and add, that if they cannot in fact, as well as in appearance, tru&s;t me with the uncontroul|ed command of their army, I will no longer be their puppet. Why &s;hould I? it being now morally cer|tain that by going on as we have hitherto done, I can neither bring honour nor profit to them; and yet am &s;ure to lo&s;e all the little of either which I either have, or might have, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I want words to expre&s;s to you what I have felt, and &s;till do feel on this di&s;appointment of all my hopes: I had allowed my&s;elf to build too much on my &s;cheme I and I &s;eem to be in the &s;ituation of one who &s;hould be allowed to ri&s;e, on purpo&s;e only to be thrown down. The enemy, in the mid&s;t of all our blu&s;terings, mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e us; and did not &s;hame, or &s;ome better principle re&s;train them, I &s;hould be but little &s;urprized to find General Howe, even with his pre&s;ent little handful attacking us,&mdash;yes, attacking us in our entranchments.&mdash; What &s;hall I do? to retreat is to entail on my&s;elf the cur&s;es of every public man in my country; and to go on is certain ruin and di&s;grace. Were the world to know only my true hi&s;tory on this try<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> occa&s;ion, I per&s;uade my|&s;elf, all the candid and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">iderate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> me of blame.

my re&s;olving to tell a tale, which, con&s;idering the rank I now hold in it, mu&s;t involve my country in &s;uch in|ternal broils and quarrels, as mu&s;t be fatal to the glo|rious cau&s;e in which we have embarked. And this, I tru&s;t, I &s;hall have the virtue never to do, be my private wrongs and &s;ufferings ever &s;o great.</P>
<P>I have fini&s;hed my letter to the Congre&s;s, to whom I have at length, &s;poken in a more peremptory tone, than, I fancy, they have been u&s;ed to. It was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and I &s;hould ill de&s;erve their confidence, if through any mi&s;taken complai&s;ance or diffidence, I he&s;itated to point out to them the mi&s;|chievous con&s;equences of their interference. I have al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted on preci&s;e in&s;tructions in what manner I am to conduct my&s;elf towards the Briti&s;h commi&s;|&s;ioners, if peradventure, as is probable, their over|tures &s;hall be made through me. Their an&s;wer will have a great influence on all my future mea&s;ures; as I &s;hall then know, (and &s;urely it is time I &s;hould) on what ground I &s;tand. The very decided and ad|venturous mea&s;ure, which Congre&s;s it&s;elf has ju&s;t taken, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> big with the mo&s;t important con&s;equences, not only to the community at large, but to every man in it. The temper and judgement which they &s;hall now manife&s;t, on their fir&s;t avowed a&s;&s;umption of the rein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of government, will be indicative of what we may hereafter expect. Hoping for the be&s;t, I yet will watch them mo&s;t carefully.</P>
<P>'Tis all fearful expectation: Every man I &s;ee &s;eems to be employed in preparing him&s;elf for the momen|tous rencontre, which every man per&s;uades him&s;elf mu&s;t &s;hortly come on.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Lund,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LAST Friday, the Briti&s;h fleet was &s;een off Sta|ten-I&s;land; they have &s;ince been employed, uninterrupted by us, in debarking their men, &s;tores, &amp;c. And as they mu&s;t now, I &s;hould imagine, be pretty nearly as &s;trong as they expect to be this cam|paign, no doubt we &s;hall &s;oon hear of their motions. I have rea&s;on to believe, their fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay will not be on this, but on Long-I&s;land; where injudiciou&s;ly I think, we al&s;o are, or &s;oon &s;hall be in force. Yet, if we do but act our parts as becomes us, be the i&s;&s;ue as it may, we &s;hall at lea&s;t give them no plea&s;ing ear|ne&s;t of what they have to expect in the cour&s;e of the war. But there is no relying on any plan that is to be executed by raw men.</P>
<P>You have heard much of the powers with which commi&s;&s;ioners were to be in ve&s;ted, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ettling this di&s;pute. Like mo&s;t other things belong|ing to it, the&s;e too have made a much greater figure in talk, than they do in fact. There are but two com|mi&s;&s;ioners, the two Howes; and their powers are ex|tremely vague and undefined. It is a pity, methinks, that Congre&s;s had not had better information on this &s;ubject; if they had, it is to be pre&s;umed, they would not have precipitated the declaration of independen|cy, &s;o as to preclude all po&s;&s;ibility of negociation. I may venture to whi&s;per in your ear, that this except|ed, I firmly believe, that America might have carried every other point; and certainly, there was a time, when this would have been deemed a conque&s;t beyond the warme&s;t w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hes of the warme&s;t American. Whe|ther in the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs, it &s;till be &s;o, is another que&s;tion: I can an&s;wer only for my&s;elf, that I would not even a&s;k &s;o much.&mdash;Different men will judge differently with re&s;pect to this conduct, on the part of Great-Britain; I own I am bewildered and puzzled to account for it. After &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing
<PB N="22" REF="015868_0023_0F9A2FFE0EFFDBE8">
expence as they have been at, and with &s;uch fair pro&s;pects as they have before them of being &s;oon in a capacity to pre&s;cribe their own term<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, it certainly is extraordinary to find them conde&s;cending to be friends with us, on conditions as mortifying and de|grading to them, as they are flattering to us. I can account for it but in one way; I really a&s;cribe it to their magnanimity. It mu&s;t be an unplea&s;ing conte&s;t to the nation: I &s;ay the nation; for however expe|dient it may be for us to have it called a mini&s;terial war, no man who knows any thing of the Engli&s;h go|vernment, can imagine, that the mini&s;try could have moved a &s;tep in it, if it had not been the &s;en&s;e&punc; of the nation. It mu&s;t, too, be a mo&s;t fruitle&s;s and unpro|fitable war; &s;ince every advantage they can gain, mu&s;t in fact be a lo&s;s, as being gained over them&s;elves. No wonder, therefore, they have been &s;low and back|ward to enter into it; no wonder they would be glad to be well rid of it, on almo&s;t any terms. I have ever been of this opinion, and it was this per&s;ua&s;ion alone that reconciled me to the mea&s;ure of taking up arms. I &s;ee, however, the world around me viewing it in a different light; every conce&s;&s;ion that is made to us, they attribute to timidity only, and de&s;pondency. I own appearances make for this conjecture; and, no doubt, Congre&s;s will give it its &s;anction.</P>
<P>I have not adopted this opinion, that we might have peace with Great-Britain, on terms which would once, have been thought mo&s;t honorable, on &s;light grounds. Ye&s;terday, a letter was bro't to me, ma|king overtures for a nego<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iation, from Lord Howe. &mdash;I had expected it; and had my in&s;tructions. It was addre&s;&s;ed, as I had fore&s;een, to me as in my private character only. On the ground of indepen|dency, if we cho&s;e to maintain it, this was not a mere matter of punctilio; it was the critical moment of trial, whether we would a&s;&s;ert, or recede from our preten&s;ions. Never did men &s;it in debate on a que&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on of higher magnitude: and when they had once de|termined to declare their country free, I &s;ee not why they might not &s;upport this their declaration, by this as well as other means. A contrary conduct would
<PB N="23" REF="015868_0024_0F9A2FFED03D3A00">
certainly have indicated &s;ome want of firmne&s;s. Yet, I confe&s;s to you, I felt aukward upon the occa&s;ion. The puncti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">io &s;eemed, and it could not but &s;eem, to be my own: and as &s;uch it looked, methought, as though I were proud of my titles. Put your&s;elf in my place, and &s;ee me, longing as you know I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly for peace, yet turning my back on a gentleman, whom I had rea&s;on to con&s;ider as the harbinger of it, only becau&s;e he a&s;ked for Mr. and not, GENERAL WASHINGTON. How often it is my lot to find it my indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to act a part con|trary to both my own &s;entiments and inclinations! But, if I mi&s;take not, it is in &s;uch in&s;tances only, that, properly &s;peaking, we manife&s;t our fortit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de and magnanimity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall a&s;toni&s;h you, when I inform you, that this fir&s;t rebuff abated not the ardour of the noble com|mi&s;&s;ioner. His Deputy paid as a &s;econd vi&s;it, and vouch&s;afed to honour me with the appellation of General. What name will you give to this conde&s;|cen&s;ion? I own it hurt me; and has well nigh led me into a train of thinking very different from all my former opinions. The gentleman who brought the me&s;&s;age, is a Colonel Patter&s;on, Adjutant General, and a &s;en&s;ible well informed man. He reque&s;ted to &s;peak to me alone; and I was glad he did. After the fir&s;t &s;alutations, he told me the purport of the letter which had been refu&s;ed; and his errand now was to a&s;k me to point out the mo&s;t eligible means of opening a negociation, for the purpo&s;e of accommo|dating the unhappy di&s;pute. I replied, that I knew but of one way; and that was by application to Con|gre&s;s. He &s;aid, the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners would have no objection to treating with the members who compo&s;ed the Congre&s;s, provided only that they came with legal authority from the regular legi&s;la|tures of their re&s;pective countries. I an&s;wered, they, doubtle&s;s would come with &s;uch authority; as in|deed, they could come with no other. I evidently &s;aw his drift in the exception, as he did mine: and &s;o put a &s;top to all po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;take; he declared it impo&s;&s;ible for his ma&s;ters ever to acknowledge the
<PB N="24" REF="015868_0025_0F9A3000072669F0">
Congre&s;s, as &s;uch, a legal, and con&s;titutional body of men; and as it &s;eemed to be rather a punctilio of pride, than of any real importance, he hoped it might be waved. I &s;tared: How, Sir, have you not already acknowledged the powers of Congre&s;s, by acknow|ledging the honourable rank I hold, and which I hold from them, and them only? That &s;aid he, was the conce&s;&s;ion merely of politene&s;s; and made for the purpo&s;e only of getting acce&s;s to me; and he was per&s;uaded, I was too &s;en&s;ible a man to lay any &s;tre&s;s on &s;o m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re a trifle; I thanked him for his compli|ment, but a&s;&s;ured him, that I meant to lay the mo&s;t &s;erious &s;tre&s;s on it. If he really had had that opinion of my under&s;tanding which he was plea&s;ed then to expre&s;s, he mu&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed, that though a trifle in it&s;elf, it cea&s;ed to be &s;o after I had made a point of it.</P>
<P>Words could not have told him more &s;trongly that our re&s;olutions were to a&s;&s;ert and maintain our in|dependency. And if the commi&s;&s;ioners of the King of Great-Britain found them&s;elves either unable or unwilling to give up this, as a preliminary article, they, &amp; he mu&s;t pardon me for &s;aying, that I could but think them very idly employed in &s;oliciting an inter|view with me. On this he prepared to take his leave, fir&s;t adding with a degree of &s;harpne&s;s and animation, that I own affected me. Sir, &s;aid he, you are plea&s;|ed to be cavalier with me: I con&s;ider you as a well-meaning &mdash;I wi&s;h I could &s;ay, well-informed man; yet, I am mi&s;taken, if your head, as well as your heart, would not, at this moment, dictate a very dif|ferent language. There may be heroi&s;m, for ought I know, in de&s;perately re&s;olving to go all length<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the men with whom you have connected your|&s;elf; but it is madne&s;s: and you may be thankful, if po&s;terity gives no wor&s;e a name to a man who has no judgment of his own Wrong, Sir, your judg|ment no longer. We certainly have &s;tooped as low as the proude&s;t wrong-head among you could a&s;k us; but, if you really think as you &s;eem to affect to do, that we have made the&s;e overtures either from mean|ne&s;s, from a di&s;tru&s;t of our cau&s;e, or our ability to make good our ju&s;t claims, you are out in all your
<PB N="25" REF="015868_0026_0F9A30005058D468">
reckoning. That the mean and narrow-minded leaders of your councils may di&s;&s;eminate &s;uch opini|ons, in your unhappy country, I can ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e; but remember, Sir, you, and your party, owe &s;ome account to the world! and when the world &s;hall come to know your infatuated in&s;olence in the in|&s;tance before us, as know it they mu&s;t, think how you will excu&s;e your&s;elves? I replied with no le&s;s warmth, nor I tru&s;t, dignity. I was, indeed, flung: for after once having owned me as a General, you mu&s;t confe&s;s there was &s;omething &s;ingularly contemp|tuous in pre&s;uming thus to &s;chool me. A few per|&s;onal civilities put an end to the conference.</P>
<P>I have tran&s;mitted a faithful account of it to Con|gre&s;s; but, as I can hardly &s;uppo&s;e, they will judge it expedient to make it public, I thought I owed to you, not wholly to di&s;appoint your curio&s;ity. You will not, however, need me to caution you to be &s;ecret, as well on this as on other things, which I write to you.</P>
<P>One thing more I mu&s;t not omit to mention to you. In my conference with Colonel Patter&s;on, I thought I could di&s;cover that it was intended I &s;hould be impre&s;&s;ed with a per&s;ua&s;ion that the commi&s;&s;ion|ers thought not unfavourably of our preten&s;ions, as urged in the beginning of the di&s;pute. This is to be accounted for. They are whigs; and if I am right|ly informed, the General owes his &s;eat in Parliament to the intere&s;t of the di&s;&s;enters. But why approve of our fir&s;t preten&s;ions only? Surely if we were then right, we are not now wrong: I mean as to what we have a right to, by the principles of the con&s;titu|tion; the expediency of our mea&s;ures is now out of que&s;tion. I cannot di&s;&s;ociate the ideas between our having a right of re&s;i&s;tance in the ca&s;e of taxation, and the &s;ame right in the ca&s;e of legi&s;lating for us. You know I am no deep ca&s;ui&s;t in political &s;pecula|tions, but having happily been brought up in revolu|tion principles, I thought I trod &s;urely when I traced the foot&s;teps of tho&s;e venerable men. Wonderful! The&s;e too are the principles of our opponents; &s;o that all our misfortune and fault is the having put in practice the very tenets which they profe&s;s to embrace</P>

<HEAD>New-York, <DATE>July <HI>22, 1776.</HI></DATE> To Mr. Lund Wa&s;hington, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I WISH I could &s;ay I thoroughly approved of all the new regulations in the new in&s;titution of government in my native &s;tate. It could, however, hardly have been expected that a reformation &s;o ca|pital and comprehen&s;ive &s;hould be perfect at fir&s;t; the wonder is, it is not &s;till more exceptionable. My heart glows with unu&s;ual warmth, when I advert, as I often do, to that pure and di&s;intere&s;ted ardour which mu&s;t have animated the bulk of my country|men throughout the whole of this controver&s;y. There may be exceptions among&s;t us, and no doubt, there are; but it is not fair to infer this from our uncom|mon impetuo&s;ity and violence. This one would wi&s;h re&s;trained, but, by no means extirpated; for is it not the effect of a highly agitated public &s;pirit; the mere efferve&s;cence of good principles thrown into a &s;tate of &s;trong fermentation? And, &s;urely&punc; even pre|cipitancy is preferable to the &s;pirit-breaking cau|tions of chill de&s;pondency. Yet I am no advocate, in general, either for ra&s;h mea&s;ures, or ra&s;h men; but at &s;uch a conjuncture as this, men had need to be &s;timulated by &s;ome more active principle than cool and &s;ober rea&s;on. They mu&s;t be enthu&s;ia&s;ts, or they will continue to be &s;laves.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="015868_0028_0F9A3001CFFB3F60">I give this in an&s;wer to my friend Mr. Carter's objections to the fir&s;t procedures of the new govern|ment. No doubt, Henry is, in many re&s;pects, the unfitte&s;t man in the &s;tate for Governor of Virginia. He has no property, no learning, but little good &s;en&s;e, and &s;till le&s;s virtue or public &s;pirit; but he is the idol of the people; and, as it is by their means only that you can hope to effect the grand &s;chemes which you have meditated, you mu&s;t humour them, and indulge them with their rattle. They will &s;oon tire of him; and the opportunity mu&s;t then be watched gently to lead them to a better choice; for they may be led, though they cannot be driven. And though it be, alas! but too true, that they often mi&s;take their real intere&s;ts, I am of opinion they never mi&s;take them long. Sooner or later, they will judge and act from their &s;ettled feelings; and the&s;e I take it are generally founded in their &s;ettled intere&s;ts. When great enter|prizes are to be performed, we may well di&s;pen&s;e with &s;ome little errors in judgment: when without that, we have, in its &s;tead, that which perhaps, we could not have with it; I mean, that undi&s;ciplined ardour which is infinitely better adapted to our purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>There cannot be a more &s;triking in&s;tance that the judgment of the people may, in general, be &s;afely tru&s;ted, in the long run, than is to be met with in Virginia. Very few countries have to boa&s;t of more men of re&s;pectable under&s;tandings; I know of none that can produce a family, all of them d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tingui&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> as clever men, like our Lees. They are all of them the very men one would wi&s;h for to take the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of a willing multitude; for, they are certainly men of &s;hining talents, and their talents are of that particul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r kind which u&s;ually render men popular. No men were ever more &s;o, than the men in que&s;tion once were. It is obvious, this is no longer the ca&s;e; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the rea&s;on mu&s;t be that they are no longer worthy of it. With all their cleverne&s;s, they are &s;elfi&s;h in the extreme. The people, at length, have found this out; or, no doubt, R. H&punc; Lee would have now been go|vernor, the grand object of all his aims.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="015868_0029_0F9A30029003D698">You would be mortified to hear the critici&s;ms which are common here on Henry's inauguration &s;peech. It is, indeed, a poor and pitiful performance; and yet I can believe, that &s;et off by his &s;mooth and oily delivery, it would appear clever when he &s;poke it. Why did he not a&s;k Mr. Page to prepare it for him? There is not a man in America more capable. The Coun&s;ellors of &s;tate are certainly irreproachable, and will do honor to tho&s;e who appointed them. I am particularly plea&s;ed with the &s;ucce&s;s of my hone&s;t brother-in-law, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Dandridge; and the plea&s;ure is not le&s;&s;ened by the a&s;&s;urance he makes me, that my letters were &s;erviceable to him, there being but few men whom I love more than I do him. As you are &s;oon to go down the country, you will &s;ee him, and therefore &s;pare me the trouble of writing, particular|ly to him. My friends mu&s;t now be &s;o indulgent to me, as to wave the matter of compliment; I think my&s;elf happy, whenever I can write, as I &s;hould, on urgent bu&s;ine&s;s. You know how tickli&s;h my &s;ituation is; little as one would think, there is to be envied in it, I yet am envied. And though, in all good rea&s;on; their fears &s;hould take a direct contrary cour&s;e, there are who are for ever &s;ugge&s;ting &s;u&s;pici|ons and jealou&s;ies of the army and its commander. My own heart a&s;&s;ures me, I mean them no ill; how|ever, if I really have the influence and a&s;cendency which they &s;uppo&s;e, I will, for their &s;akes as well as my own, hereafter maintain it at &s;ome little co&s;t. A thou&s;and con&s;iderations determine me to &s;train every nerve to prevent the army's being under any other controul, whil&s;t I live. Let a per&s;ua&s;ion of the nece&s;&s;i|ty of this, if occa&s;ion &s;hould ari&s;e, be &s;ea&s;onably urged in my native &s;tate: and, in the mean while, let &s;ome more than ordinary pains be taken to make me po|pular. Their own honor and intere&s;t are both con|cerned in my being &s;o. Shew this to Mr. Dandridge; and, as you both can enter into my meaning, even from the mo&s;t di&s;tant hints, I can re&s;t &s;atisfied, that you will do every thing I wi&s;h you.</P>
<P>We have lately had a general review; and I have much plea&s;ure in informing you, that we made a
<PB N="29" REF="015868_0030_0F9A3003511FE170">
better appearance, and went through our exerci&s;es more like &s;oldiers, than I had expected. The Southern &s;tates are ra&s;h and blameable in the judg|ment they generally form of their brethren of the four New-England &s;tates; I do a&s;&s;ure you, with all my partiality for my own countrymen, and preju|dices again&s;t them, I cannot but con&s;ider them as the flower of the American army. They are a &s;trong, vigourous, and hardy people, inured to la|bour and toil; which our people &s;eldom are. And though our hot and eager &s;pirits may, perhaps, &s;uit better in a &s;udden and de&s;perate enterpri&s;e: yet in the way in which wars are now carried on, you mu&s;t look for permanent advantages only from that pa|tient and per&s;evering temper, which is the re&s;ult of a life of labour. The New-Englanders are cool, con|&s;iderate and &s;en&s;ible; whil&s;t we are all fire and fury: like their climate, they maintain an equal tempe|rature, whereas we cannot &s;hine, but we burn. They have a uniformity and &s;tability of character, to which the people of no other &s;tates have any pre|ten&s;ions; hence they mu&s;t, and will always pre|&s;erve their influence in this great Empire. Were it not for the drawbacks and the di&s;advantages, which the influence of their popular opinions, on the &s;ub|ject of government, have on their army, they &s;oon might, and probably would, give law to it. If General Putnam had the talents of Mr. S. Adams, or Mr. Adams had his, perhaps, even at this mo|ment, this had not been matter of conjecture. But, Putnam is a plain, blunt, unde&s;igning old fellow, who&s;e views reach no farther than the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion. He is, indeed, very ignorant; yet, I find him a u&s;eful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fficer; and chiefly becau&s;e he neither plagues me not others, with wrangling claims of privileges. I owe him too no &s;mall acknow|ledgments, for the fairne&s;s of his accounts. I could open to you &s;ome &s;trange &s;cenes in this way.

becomes them. &mdash; But, as I have often told you, General Mercer is the man, on whom the&s;e &s;tates mu&s;t re&s;t their hopes. The character that one of his countrymen g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve to the Pretender, fits him exactly; "He is the mo&s;t cautious man I ever &s;aw, not to be a coward; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the brave&s;t not to be ra&s;h." In my judgment, he is not inferior even to General Lee, in military knowledge; and, in almo&s;t every thing el&s;e, he is, infinitely, his &s;uperior. Yet the overbearing virtues of this la&s;t named gentleman are u&s;eful to us, e&s;pecially at our &s;etting out: we want|ed not the &s;ober and &s;low deductions of argument and rea&s;on: and Lee, like the author of Common Sen&s;e, has talents perfectly formed to dazzle and confound.</P>
<P>I thank you for your care in making the remit|tances you mention to Me&s;&s;rs. Carey and Co.

Have we lived, now almo&s;t a &s;core of years, in the clo&s;e&s;t and deare&s;t congugal intimacy to &s;o little purpo&s;e that, on an appearance only of inattention to you, and which you might have accounted for in a thou&s;and ways more natural and more probable, you &s;hould pitch upon that &s;ingle motive which alone is injurious to me? I have not, I own, wrote &s;o often to you as I wi&s;hed, and as I ought. But think of my &s;ituation and then a&s;k your heart, if I be WITHOUT EXCUSE. We are not, my deare&s;t in circum&s;tances the mo&s;t favourable to our happine&s;s: but let us not, I be&s;eech you, idly make them wor&s;e, by indulging &s;u&s;picions and apprehen&s;ions which minds in di&s;tre&s;s are but too apt to give way to.

<P>I congratulate you mo&s;t cordially on the fair pro&s;pect of recovery of your amiable daughter-in-law; nor can I wonder, that this &s;econd lo&s;s of a little one &s;hould affect you, I fear the fatigues of the journey, and the perpetual agitations of a camp, were too much for her. They are, however, both young and healthy; &s;o that there can be little doubt of their &s;oon repairing the lo&s;s.</P>
<P>And now will my deare&s;t love permit me, a little more earne&s;tly than I have ever yet done, to pre&s;s you to con&s;ent to that &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o &s;afe &amp; &s;o ea&s;y, though &s;o dreaded a thing&mdash;the being innoculated?

approbation of your conduct. Farther than this I intended not to proceed, My &s;ermon &s;peaks for it|&s;elf, and wholly di&s;claims the idea of independen|cy. My &s;entiments were well known to my friends; I communicated them, without re&s;erve, to many re|&s;pectable members of Congre&s;s, who expre&s;&s;ed their warm approbation of it then. I per&s;i&s;ted, to the very la&s;t moment, to u&s;e the prayers for my Sovereign, though threatened with in&s;ults from the violence of a party.

A very few days after the fatal declaration o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|pendency, I received a letter from Mr. Hancock, &s;ent by expre&s;s to Germantown, where my family were for the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, acquainting me I was appointed Chapl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n to the Congre&s;s, and de&s;ired my atendence next morning at 9 o'clock.

the matter Upon the return of the committee of Con|gre&s;s, appointed to confer with Lord Howe, I &s;oon di&s;|cerned their whole intentions. The different accounts which each member gave of this conference, the time they took to make up the matter for public view, and the amazing di&s;agreement between the new&s;pa|per accounts and the relation I my&s;elf had from the mouth of one of the committee, convinced me there mu&s;t have been &s;ome unfair and ungenerous pro|cedure. This determination, to treat on no other &s;train than that of independency, which put it out of his Lord&s;hip's power to mention any terms at all, was &s;ufficient proof to me, that independency was the idol they had long wi&s;hed to &s;et up, and that, rather than &s;acrifice this, they would deluge their country with blood. From this moment I deter|mined upon my re&s;ignation, and, in the beginning of October 1776, &s;ent it in form to Mr. Hancock, after having officiated only two months and three weeks; and from that time, as far as my &s;afety would permit, I have been oppo&s;ed to all their mea|&s;ures. This circum&s;tantial account of my conduct, I think due to the friend&s;hip you were &s;o obliging as to expre&s;s for me, and I hope will be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify any &s;eeming incon&s;i&s;tencies in the part I have acted. And now, dear Sir, &s;uffer me, in the lan|guage of truth and real affection, to addre&s;s my&s;elf to you. All the world mu&s;t be convinced you are en|gaged in the &s;ervice of your country from motives perfectly di&s;intere&s;ted. You ri&s;ked every thing that was dear to you, abandoned the &s;weets of dome&s;tic life, which your affluent fortune can give the unin|terrupted enjoyment of. But, had you, could you have had, the lea&s;t idea of matters being carried to &s;uch a dangerous extremity? Your mo&s;t intimate friends &s;huddered at the thought of a &s;eparation from the mother country, and I took it for granted that your &s;entiments coincided with theirs.

Have they not frequently abandoned you your&s;elf, in the hour of extremity? Can you, have you the lea&s;t con|fidence in a &s;et of undi&s;ciplined men and officers, ma|ny of them have been taken from the lowe&s;t of the people without principle, without courage; take away them who &s;urround your per&s;on, how very few are there you can a&s;k to &s;it at your table?&mdash;As to your little navy, of that little, what is left?

They have amu&s;ed you with hopes of a declaration of war on the part of France. Be|lieve me, from the be&s;t authority, it was a fiction from the fir&s;t.&mdash; Early in the year 1776, a French gentle|man was introduced to me, with whom I became in|timately acquainted.

can never be &s;upported unle&s;s France &s;hould declare war again&s;t England. I well know the &s;tate of her finances, years to come will not put them in a &s;itua|tion to enter upon a breach with England.&mdash;At this moment there are two parties in the court of Ver&s;ailles; one inli&s;ted under the Duke De Choi&s;eul, the other under Count Maurepas. Choi&s;eul has no chance of &s;ucceeding, tho' he is violent for war; Maurepas mu&s;t get the better; he is for oeconomy and peace; this was his information, which I mentioned to &s;everal members of Congre&s;s, they treated it as a fable, de|pending entirely on Doctor Franklin's intelligence. The truth of the matter is this: Dr. Franklin built upon the &s;ucce&s;s of Choi&s;eul. Upon his arrival in France he found him out of place, his councils repro|bated, and his party dwindled into an in&s;ignificant faction: This you may depend upon to be the true &s;tate of affairs in France, or the court of Dr. Frank|lin. And further, by va&s;t numbers of letters found on board prizes taken by the King's &s;hips, it appears, that all commerce with the merchants, through whom all your &s;upplies have been conveyed, will be at an end; the letters being full of complaints of no remit|tances from America, and many individuals having generally &s;uffered.&mdash;From your friends in England you have nothing to expect, their numbers have di|mini&s;hed to a cypher; the &s;pirit of the whole nation is in activity, a few &s;ounding names among the no|bility, though perpetually ringing in your ears, are without character, without influence. Di&s;appointed ambition has made them de&s;perate, and they only wi&s;h to make the deluded Americans in&s;truments of re|venge. All orders and ranks of men in Great-Bri|tain, are now unanimous and determined to ri&s;que their all with content. Trade and manufactures are found to flouri&s;h, and new channels are continually offering, that will perhaps more than &s;upply the lo&s;s of the old.

This indeed is a &s;plendid maxim in theory, and perhaps in &s;ome in&s;tances may be found experimentally true; but when there is the lea&s;t probability of an happy ac|commodation, &s;urely wi&s;dom and humanity call for &s;ome &s;acrifices to be made, to prevent inevitable de|&s;truction.

And though many of our officers and men who heretofore never &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in private life, more than in the character of hone&s;t citizens, or farmers; yet we have numbers who have held the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable po&s;ts in government, and are highly re&s;pected as private Gentlemen, &s;uch who&s;e names have often reached your ears, and whom you have not been a&s;hamed to profe&s;s a friend&s;hip for, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e Gentlemen who &s;urrounded his Excellency's per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="015868_0051_0F9A30130F5F7878">As to our little fleet, which you have already an|nihilated in idea; believe me, that does not form the nerves of our oppo&s;ition. Your arguments again&s;t the probability of a French war, and the fine-&s;pun anecdote of a certain &s;peculative French trader, I purpo&s;ely omit, leaving the event in the hands of all-revealing time, which doubtle&s;s we &s;hall have no cau&s;e to be di&s;&s;atisfied with. We do not court the friend&s;hip of England, its inhabitants have never done us any material &s;ervices; on the contrary, they have voted ample &s;upplies to hire foreigners to &s;pill our blood unju&s;tly: they never exerted them&s;elves to effect; it was once in their power to have &s;pared the lives of our butchered countrymen,&mdash;to have prevented the tears of many widows and orphans, now deprived of their deare&s;t connections by a band of hireling Scotch and German ruffians. We know that the &s;pirit of the whole nation is in full activity again&s;t us, and we have already experienced the ef|fects of that humane &s;pirit, which you &s;ay is united and determined. Some few noble patriotic &s;ouls are yet left in both Hou&s;es of Parliament, though you have the con&s;ummate a&s;&s;urance to &s;ay they are with|out character, and without influence, who&s;e &s;teady oppo&s;ition has no other motive than de&s;pair, ven|geance, and di&s;appointment.&mdash;But America will ever have a grateful &s;en&s;e of their merits, in &s;pite of the calumny of their and our enemies.</P>
<P>Since the Declaration of Independency, the ground of our conte&s;t is materially changed; and it is not rights and priviledges for which we now fight, but dominion and empire are the objects of both parties. Britain is endeavouring to reduce us to conquered provinces, and again to monopolize our trade. Why then this immen&s;e expence of blood and trea&s;ure? when you tell us that "new channels are continually opening, that will perhaps more than &s;upply the lo&s;s of the old."&mdash;It is only changing the navigation from America to Europe, and the lo&s;s of our trade and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nafactures will never be felt by England.</P>
<P>The whole navy of Great-Britain is not &s;ufficient to block up all our harbours; and though fortre&s;&s;es
<PB N="51" REF="015868_0052_0F9A3013D1964220">
are taken, and battles lo&s;t, the victors have ever rea|&s;on to lament the conque&s;t. Every day their army moulders away, whil&s;t ours, like the Hydra, encrea&s;es two-fold; and notwith&s;tanding they now po&s;&s;e&s;s our unfortunate capital, I may ju&s;tly cry out with you, "How unequal the conte&s;t! how fruitle&s;s the ex|pence of blood!"</P>
<P>After recapitulating every di&s;couragement calcula|ted to terrify weak minds, like an able logician, you draw an inference as foreign from the premi&s;es as probably you and I will be, before this letter reaches you. Ergo, "Under &s;o many di&s;couraging circum|&s;tances, can virtue, can honour, or the love of your country, prompt you to per&s;evere? Humanity it&s;elf, (and then a &s;troke of flattery) calls you to de&s;i&s;t." The very idea of virtue implies difficulties and di&s;ap|pointments; was it not &s;o, patrioti&s;m would degene|rate into licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and liberty be of no real value.</P>
<P>True it is, that where-ever our army encamps, it becomes &s;omewhat burthen&s;ome to the inhabitants of the vicinage: But ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of the Briti&s;h &s;poiler&mdash;murder, rape, robbery, and burning, mark their foot&s;teps. And though &s;ometimes they may pur&s;ue, they as often &s;hamefully retreat, and con|tinue the deva&s;tation which they (not we) have be|gun.</P>
<P>Wi&s;dom dictates a glorious and happy peace, and humanity wi&s;hes for it, but accommodation &s;eems to imply dependance: A &s;acrifice which I am confident America will never make. You call upon his Ex|cellency in the name of the whole Continent, to make this de&s;tructive &s;acrifice, and to become "the friend and guardian of his country"&mdash;by withdrawing his protection.</P>
<P>As a full and conclu&s;ive an&s;wer to the two follow|ing paragraphs, I refer you to a &s;erious peru&s;al of Lord Chatham's &s;peech in the Hou&s;e of Lord's&punc; June third, 1777.</P>
<P>That you did not write this letter under the eye, or immediate in&s;pection of any Briti&s;h officer, or any per&s;on connected with the Briti&s;h army or mini&s;try,
<PB N="52" REF="015868_0053_0F9A30148E943168">
is the only a&s;&s;ertion in your whole performance which is believed; but that you wrote it at the in&s;tigation of &s;ome, and for the peru&s;al and eclat of all &s;uch per|&s;ons, appears very evident. This is a ma&s;ter piece of ca&s;ui&s;try, and would do honour to the elde&s;t &s;on of St. Ignatius him&s;elf.</P>
<P>After ca&s;ting he foule&s;t a&s;per&s;ions on Congre&s;s, &s;candalizing the officers and the army, and affronting his Excellency with the mo&s;t villanous propo&s;itions, you &s;ay, "I would fain hope, that I have &s;aid noth|ing by which your delicacy can in the lea&s;t be hurt, if &s;o, 'twas without intentention, and your candour will lead you to forgive me." O mo&s;t con&s;ummate a&s;|&s;urance! You would not offend the meane&s;t per&s;on on earth; I believe you, Sir&mdash;you cannot offend, your ob&s;curity hides you, and your in&s;ignificance renders harmle&s;s the &s;hafts of your malice.</P>
<P>I never before &s;aw a di&s;crimination between the love of truth, of peace, of our God, and the love of our country. The end of war is peace&mdash;'tis for that we are now contending. Peace promotes truth and Religion; your principles would annihilate both. 'Tis for our country we fight, for her we dare bleed &mdash;Religion and ju&s;tice approve to conflict.</P>
<P>In fine, your whole performance is a rhap&s;ody, without pathos to &s;often, or arguments to convince; and your la&s;t propo&s;ition is of &s;uch a horrid, villa|nous nature, that I blu&s;h to think o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I &s;incerely lament your departure from virtue, from honour, from your country which, a|las! you have for-ever &s;old. This, perhaps, may be &s;aid in your excu&s;e,&mdash;
<Q>Incenditque Animum Famoe venientis Amore.</Q></P>
<P>But can riches, can fame, or clerical preferment re|pay you for a lo&s;t character &amp; pro&s;tituted con&s;cience? The&s;e &s;hores, as well as your own reflections, will be forever ho&s;tile to you. You are now going to a country where you mu&s;t flatter for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and exi&s;t upon the &s;miles of the great. A mi&s;erable &s;tate of dependance and &s;ervility is the only pro&s;pect before you; and this is the eligible exchange you have

made&mdash;O Tempora! O Mores!&mdash;Your talents will perhaps be exerci&s;ed there to as little purpo&s;e as her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: You will ever be the contempt of hone&s;t men, and the tool of high-prie&s;ts and knaves in power.</P>
<P>I leave you in the hands of Heaven and a guilty con&s;cience, and am your humble &s;ervant,</P>
