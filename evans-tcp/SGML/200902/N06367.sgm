<HEAD>A Journal of the Siege and Surrender of <HI>Lou|isbourg,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 28th of <HI>May</HI> I had the good Fortune to meet Admiral <HI>Bo&s;cawen</HI> with the fleet and troops coming out of the harbour of <HI>Halifax.</HI> Lieutenant-General <HI>Bragg</HI>'s regiment, from the Bay of Fundy, joined the fleet this Day.</P>
<P>The 29th we had &s;ine weather; the &s;hips kept well together; the whole con&s;i&s;ted of 157 &s;ail. The Dub|lin [which carried over General <HI>Amher&s;t</HI>] went very &s;ickly into <HI>Halifax.</HI></P>
<P>The 30th the wind blew hard in the Afternoon; the &s;hips were greatly di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t the wind &s;ometimes contrary, obliged us to tack, and it blew fre&s;h.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of <HI>June</HI> Capt. <HI>Rous,</HI> in the Sutherland, came from off the harbour of <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> and &s;aid, two &s;hips
<PB N="4" REF="008076_0003_102FD10F679DE438">had got in the 30th; and that there were thirteen &s;ail in the harbour. We &s;aw the entrance of <HI>Gabarous</HI> at night.</P>
<P>The 2nd it was foggy in the morning; about twelve &s;aw <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> and the &s;hips in the harbour. The fleet, with about a third of the troops, anchored in <HI>Ga|barous</HI> Bay; and this evening, with Brigadier-Generals <HI>Lawrence</HI> and <HI>Wolfe,</HI> I reconnoitred the &s;hore as near as we could, and made a di&s;po&s;ition for landing in three places the next morning, in ca&s;e the troops arrived.</P>
<P>The enemy had a chain of po&s;ts from <HI>Cape Noir</HI> to the <HI>Flat Point</HI> and irregulars from thence to the bottom of the bay; &s;ome works thrown up at the places which appeared practicable to land at, and &s;ome batteries.</P>
<P>On the 3d, mo&s;t of the tran&s;ports came in this morn|ing, all was prepared for landing; but the &s;urff on &s;hore was &s;o great, it was impo&s;&s;ible to land. This day Bri|gadier-General <HI>Whitmore</HI> arrived from <HI>Halifax,</HI> at which place I have left Colonel <HI>Monckton</HI> to command. As one bay was found to have le&s;s &s;urff than the others, a di&s;po&s;ition was made to land the next morning in one place, in&s;tead of three.</P>
<P>The 4th the wind and &s;urff were &s;o very high, that Admiral <HI>Bo&s;cawen</HI> told me it was impracticable to land.</P>
<P>The 5th a great &s;well and fog in the morning, and the Admiral declared it &s;till impracticable to land.</P>
<P>The 6th an appearance of change of weather, in the morning early: I was re&s;olved to &s;eize the fir&s;t oppor|tunity; the &s;ignal was made to prepare to land between five and &s;ix o'clock, and at eight all the men were in the boats: the fog came on again, and the &s;well increa|fed
<PB N="5" REF="008076_0004_102FD111D1821610">during the time the men were getting into the boats, and the Admiral again declared it impracticable to land. I ordered the troops on board their re&s;pective &s;hips, fir&s;t acquainting them with the rea&s;on for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>The 7th the weather bad in the morning; in the afternoon the &s;well rather decrea&s;ed, and gave us great hopes of landing at day-break the next morning, for which orders were given; and <HI>Bragg</HI>'s regiment, who were in a number of &s;loops, to &s;ail under convoy, by the mouth of the harbour, to <HI>Lorembec;</HI> &s;ending, at the &s;ame time, a proportion of artillery de&s;tin'd for the light hou&s;e point, with orders to make all the &s;hew they could of landing, but not to land till further orders, in|tending to draw the enemy's attention on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>From the 2nd to this time, the enemy has been re|inforcing their po&s;ts, adding to their works, cannonading and throwing &s;hells at the &s;hips, and making all the preparations they can to oppo&s;e our landing. Seven tran&s;ports were now mi&s;&s;ing with troops on board, three of which came in at night. The Admiral gave all ne|ce&s;&s;ary orders for the frigates to cover our landing.</P>
<P>On the 8th the troops were a&s;&s;embled in the boats before break of day, in three divi&s;ions; and Commodore <HI>'Durell</HI> having viewed the coa&s;t by order of the Admiral, and given me his opinion the troops might land, without danger from the &s;urff, in the bay on our left, the <HI>Ken|nington</HI> and <HI>Halifax</HI> &s;now began the fire on the left, followed by the <HI>Gramont, Diana,</HI> and <HI>Shannon</HI> Fri|gates in the center, and the <HI>Sutherland</HI> and <HI>Squirrel</HI> upon the right. When the fire had continued about a quarter of an hour, the boats upon the left rowed into
<PB N="6" REF="008076_0005_102FD1156236F4F8">the &s;hore, under the command of Brigadier General <HI>Wolfe,</HI> who&s;e detachment was compo&s;ed of the four elde&s;t companies of Grenadiers, followed by the Light Infantry (a corps of 550 men, cho&s;en as mark&s;men from the different regiments; they &s;erve as Irregulars, and are commanded by Major <HI>Scott,</HI> who was Major of Brigade) and the companies of Rangers, &s;upported by the Highland Regiment, and tho&s;e by the eight remain|ing companies of Grenadiers.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion on the right, under the command of Brigadier-General <HI>Whitmore,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of the Royal, <HI>La&s;celles, Monckton, Forbes, An&s;truther</HI> and <HI>Webb,</HI> and rowed to our right by the <HI>White Point,</HI> as if in|tending to force a landing there.</P>
<P>The center divi&s;ion, under the command of Briga|dier-general <HI>Lawrence,</HI> was formed of <HI>Amber&s;t's, Hop|&s;on's, Otway's, Whitmore's, Lawrence's,</HI> and <HI>War|burton</HI>'s, and made at the &s;ame time, a &s;hew of land|ing at the Fre&s;h Water Cove. This drew the enemy's attention to every part, and prevented their troops, po&s;t|ed along the coa&s;t, from joining tho&s;e on their right.</P>
<P>The enemy acted very wi&s;ely; they did not throw away a &s;hot till the boats were near in &s;hore; and then directed the whole fire of their cannon and mu&s;ketry upon them. The &s;urff was &s;o great, that a place could hardly be found to get a boat on &s;hore. Notwith&s;tan|ding the fire of the enemy, and the violence of the &s;urff, Brigadier Wolfe pur&s;ued his point, and landed ju&s;t at the left of the Cove, took po&s;t, attacked the enemy, and forced them to retreat. Many boats over&s;et, &s;e|veral
<PB N="7" REF="008076_0006_102FD116F0CB4D70">broke to pieces, and all the men jumped into the water to get on &s;hore.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the left divi&s;ion was landed, the fir&s;t de|tachments of the center rowed a proper time to the left, and followed; then the remainder of the centre divi&s;ion, as fa&s;t as the boats could fetch them from the &s;hips; and the right divi&s;ion followed the center in like manner.</P>
<P>It took up a great deal of time to land the troops; the enemy's retreat, or rather flight, was through the roughe&s;t and wor&s;t ground I ever &s;aw; and the pur&s;uit ended with a connonading from the Town, which was &s;o far of u&s;e, that it pointed out how near I could en|camp to inve&s;t it; on which the regiments marched to their ground, and lay on their Arms. The wind in|crea&s;ed, and we could not get any thing on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's troops at landing is Capt. Baillie and Lieut. Cuthbert, of the Highland regiment; Lieut. Nichol&s;on, of mine, four &s;erjeants, one corpor|al, and 38 men killed, 21 were of my regiment, (the Grenadiers) of which 8 were &s;hot, and the re&s;t drown|ed in trying to get on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Five lieutenants, two &s;erjeants, one corporal, and 51 men wounded; and of the five companies of ran|gers, one en&s;ign and three private men killed, one wounded and one mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>On the enemy's &s;ide, two captains of grenadiers, and two lieutenants, are pri&s;oners; one officer killed, and an Indian chief: &s;everal men likewi&s;e killed, and I imagine, about 70 men taken pri&s;oners: they were &s;ent on board as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. By &s;ome of the pri|&s;oners
<PB N="8" REF="008076_0007_102FD11955D41E98">I had intelligence, that M. St. Julien, colonel, commonded in the Cove: that there were five battalions in the town, namely, Bourgogne, Artois Royal, Marine, Cambi&s;e, and Volantaires Etrangers, with about 700 Canadians. The three fir&s;t regiments wintered in Loui&s;|bourg; Volontaires Etrangers, came there not long &s;ince with part of the Fleet, and Cambi&s;e the night be|fore we landed,</P>
<P>We took from the enemy three 24 pounders, &s;even nine pounders, and &s;even &s;ix pounders, two mortars, and 14 &s;wivels; all which were placed along the &s;hore, to prevent our landing; with ammunition, tools, and &s;tores of all kinds.</P>
<P>The 9th lieutenant general Bragg's regiment retur|ned in their &s;loops to Lorembec. The weather con|tinued extremely bad; the &s;urff &s;o great, that we could get only &s;ome of our tents on &s;hore in the afternoon.</P>
<P>The 10th the &s;urff &s;till continued, and it was with great difficulty we got any thing on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The 11th the weather grew clear and better, and the light &s;ix pounders, which I ordered on &s;hore im|mediately after the troops, were now only landed, and &s;ome artillery &s;tores with them.</P>
<P>On the 12th, from intelligence I had received, that the enemy had de&s;troyed the grand battery, and called in their out-po&s;ts, I detached Brigadier Wolfe with 1200 men, four companies of grenadiers, three-com|panies of rangers, and &s;ome light infantry, round the N. E. harbour to the light hou&s;e point, with an intention to &s;ilence the i&s;land battery, and, at the &s;ame time, to de&s;troy the &s;hips in the harbour; &s;ending at the &s;ame time by &s;ea, the proportion of artillery tools,
<PB N="9" REF="008076_0008_102FD11CF8221248">&amp;c. that had been ordered for this &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I received this day a report from brigadier Wolfe, that he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the light hou&s;e point, and all the po&s;ts on that &s;ide the harbour, which the enemy had abandoned, leaving &s;everal cannon, which were rendered u&s;ele&s;s, tools, &amp;c. and a great quantity of fi&s;h at Lorembec. The weather continued extremely bad; but we got &s;ome tools on &s;hore this night; &s;o that on the 13th, we began to make a communication from the right to the left in the front of the camp, and I ordered three redoubts on the mo&s;t advantageous ground in the front. A party of the enemy came out this day towards our camp, but were &s;oon beat back by the light infan|try before two piquets could well get up to their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. We worked at the three redoubts in front all night.</P>
<P>The 14th the enemy cannonaded us a great part of the day. The &s;urff &s;till continued &s;o great, that it was with the greate&s;t difficulty we could land any thing. The fleet, under the command of Sir Charles Hardy, which appeared ye&s;terday for &s;ome time, was in the night blown off to &s;ea.</P>
<P>The 15th I &s;ent four more mortars in a &s;loop to the light-hou&s;e, but we could not get any artillery landed on this &s;hore. At night two de&s;erters from the Volon|taires Etrangers came in, and &s;aid they had 5 killed, and 46 wounded, in the &s;kirmi&s;h on the 13th.</P>
<P>The 16th the fir&s;t fine weather, we landed 12 days provi&s;ions, and got many things on &s;hore, but could not yet land any artillery.</P>
<P>The 17th I got Colonel Ba&s;tide [chief Engineer] on
<PB N="10" REF="008076_0009_102FD11F66DEA348">hor&s;eback, and with Colonel William&s;on and Major M'Kellar, we reconnoitred the whole ground as far as we could; and Colonel Ba&s;tide was determined in his opinion of making approaches by the green hill, and confining the de&s;truction of the &s;hips in the harbour to the light-hou&s;e point, and the batteries on that &s;ide. I added two eight inch mortars and three royals to the light-hou&s;e batteries.</P>
<P>The 18th we had fine weather. Some Indians took three of the tran&s;ports men at the bottom of Gabarus Bay, who landed there contrary to orders. The road for the artillery was pu&s;h'd on as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. We got three 24 pounders on &s;hore, though the &s;urff was great the beginning of the Day.</P>
<P>The 19th the batteries of the Light Hou&s;e were in|tended to have been open'd this night, but could not be got ready &s;o &s;oon. L'Echo, a French frigate of 32 Guns, was brought in to-day; had got out of the har|bour the 13th at night, and was bound to Quebec: By her we have intelligence, that the Bizane got out the day we landed, and the Commette &s;ince our arrival off the harbour.</P>
<P>The 20th the I&s;land battery and &s;hips fired at the batteries on the &s;hore, who began their fire this la&s;t night. The enemy burnt an old &s;hip at the bottom of the harbour.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t very bad weather, and the &s;urff high. The enemy di&s;covered us making the road for the artillery, and canonaded us; threw &s;ome &s;hot into the left of the camp, but did not oblige me to decamp any part. An advanced redoute towards Green Hill was thrown up this night.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="008076_0010_102FD121471DEE10">
<P>The 22d the bad weather continued; we were em|ployed on the roads, and getting up a blockhou&s;e on the left, by the Miry Road, to &s;ecure the communica|tion to the N. E. harbour and Light Hou&s;e, and to hinder any parties from going into Town.</P>
<P>The 23d the Admiral a&s;&s;ured me there were above 100 boats lo&s;t in landing the troops and provi&s;ions. This day fine weather; and we have now on &s;hore twelve 24 pounders, and &s;ix twelve pounders. The enemy fired a great deal from their &s;hipping and I&s;land Battery, and threw &s;ome &s;hot into the left of the camp. Colonel <HI>Me&s;&s;ervey</HI> and mo&s;t of his carpen|ters taken ill of the &s;mall-pox, which is a very great lo&s;s to the army. Gabions and fac&s;cines are landed, and carried forward as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, to make an epaulement to Green Hill. The batteries at the Light Hou&s;e fire with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the I&s;land Battery, and I hope will &s;oon &s;ilence it.</P>
<P>On the 24th the enemy fired on the Light Hou&s;e batteries from the town and &s;hipping; and on our ad|vanced redoubt, which was fini&s;hed; they fired from the town. Colonel <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> remained fixed in his opi|nion of advancing by Green Hill. We had this day in the park of artillery thirteen 24 pounders, and &s;even 12 pounders.</P>
<P>The 25th the cannonading continued night and day: in the evening the I&s;land Battery was &s;ilenced; their own fire had helped to break down part of their works. Fa&s;cines and gabions were forwarded to Green Hill as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. All the men employed at work, and
<PB N="12" REF="008076_0011_102FD12620AC3A30">making the nece&s;&s;ary communications. The enemy fired a good deal at our advanced redoute.</P>
<P>The 26th a &s;mall alarm on the left of a party that had advanced from the town, had got up to the Block Hou&s;e, which was not quite fini&s;hed. They had with them a barrel of pitch to &s;et it on fire: the guard on it was not &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e a large party; but a de|tachment was &s;ent out &s;o quick, that they were forced to retreat without effecting their de&s;ign, though two of the men had been in the block hou&s;e, and they were drove back into the Town very fa&s;t. Three hundred pioneers ordered to Green Hill. Admiral <HI>Bo&s;cawen</HI> landed 200 marines, and took the po&s;t at Kennington Cove, which is a great ea&s;e to the army. I de&s;ired of the Admiral four 32 pounders, and two 24 pounders to leave at the Light Hou&s;e, to keep the I&s;land Bat|tery in ruin, that with a proper number of men intren|ched there, Brigadier <HI>Wolfe,</HI> with his detachment, might be able to come round the harbour, bringing his artillery with him; and to try to de&s;troy the &s;hipping, to advance towards the we&s;t gate.</P>
<P>The 27th one bra&s;s 24 pounder was lo&s;t in twelve fathom water, by &s;lipping off the catamaran, as they were coming from the &s;hip to land it. The cannon I a&s;ked of the Admiral were landed this night at the Light Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The 28th a great many popping &s;hots and cannona|ding. As the po&s;t at Green Hill was covered, we be|gan the road over the bog, and throwing up an epaule|ment. Colonel <HI>Me&s;&s;ervey</HI> and his &s;on both died this day; and of his company of carpenters of 108 men,
<PB N="13" REF="008076_0012_102FD127B04A55D0">all but 16 in the &s;mall-pox, who are nur&s;es to the &s;ick. This is particularly unlucky at this time.</P>
<P>The 29th cannonading continued, the frigate fired con&s;tantly at the epaulement; we pur&s;ued working at the road, which co&s;t a great deal of labour: at night the enemy &s;unk four &s;hips in the harbour's mouth; <HI>Apollo,</HI> a two-decked one, <HI>La Fidelle</HI> of 36 guns, <HI>La Chevre,</HI> and <HI>la Biche,</HI> of 16 guns each, and they cut off mo&s;t of their ma&s;ts. Remain in the harbour five of the line of battle, and a frigate of 36 guns.</P>
<P>The 30th at night &s;ome firing at Kennington Cove: the marines thought they &s;aw <HI>Indians:</HI> the firgate fired all night at the epaulement, as the men worked in the night time.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of <HI>July</HI> the enemy creeped out in the mor|ning to get &s;ome old palli&s;ades and wood. Brigadier <HI>Wolfe</HI> and Major <HI>Scott</HI>'s Light Infantry pu&s;hed them in with a very bri&s;k fire; and the Brigadier took po&s;ts on the hills, from whence it was intended to try to de|moli&s;h the &s;hipping; we marched forward on the right, forced the enemy back to Cape <HI>Noir</HI> with a &s;mart fire.</P>
<P>The 2nd the epaulement and road went on heavily, from the extreme badne&s;s of the ground: The enemy continued their cannonading, and threw &s;ome &s;hells; we &s;kirmi&s;hed all Day with parties out of the town.</P>
<P>The 3d a great cannonading from the town and &s;hipping, on the batteries. Brigadier <HI>Wolfe</HI> was mak|ing an advanced work on the right, thrown up 650 yards from the cover'd way, with an intention of erect|ing a battery to de&s;troy the defences of the place, it being pretty well on the capital of the citadel ba&s;tion;
<PB N="14" REF="008076_0013_102FD1296FEA3470">and the falling of the ground from this place, towards the works, would hinder di&s;covering as much of the works as would be nece&s;&s;ary to do them any damage. In the evening the &s;ea officers thought &s;ome of the &s;hips would try to get out of the harbour. The bat|teries on the left immediately play'd on them, but it grew &s;o dark they could not continue.</P>
<P>The 4th a great fog; when there were glares of light, the cannonading began; 500 men kept conti|nually making fa&s;cines.</P>
<P>The 5th very bad weather; the epaulement was ha&s;tened on as much as po&s;&s;ible; it &s;wallowed up an immen&s;e number of fa&s;cines, co&s;t &s;ome men, as the frigate cannonaded on it without cea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The 6th a &s;loop &s;ailed out of the harbour with a flag of truce to Sir <HI>Charles Hardy,</HI> to carry &s;ome things to their wounded officers and pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The many difficulties of landing everything in al|mo&s;t a continual &s;urff, the making of roads, drawing &amp; pa&s;&s;ing of bogs, and putting our&s;elves under cover ren|der our approach to the place much longer than I could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>On the 7th we had very foggy weather; cannon|ading continued all day, and a good deal of popping &s;hots from the advanced po&s;ts.</P>
<P>The 8th I intended an attack on &s;ome advanced po&s;ts at <HI>Cape-Noir,</HI> but it did not take place. Colonel <HI>Ba&s;t|ide</HI> got a contu&s;ion by a mu&s;ket ball on his boot, which laid him up in the gout.</P>
<P>The 9th, in the night, the enemy made a &s;ally where Brigadier <HI>Lawrence</HI> commanded; they came from <HI>Cape Noir,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="008076_0014_102FD12C5D270340">and tho' drunk, I am afraid rather &s;urprized a company of grenadiers of <HI>Forbes</HI>'s, commanded by Lord <HI>'Dundonald,</HI> who were po&s;ted in a fleecke, on the right, Major <HI>Murry,</HI> who commanded three companies of gre|nadiers, immediately detached one, and drove the enemy back very ea&s;ily. <HI>Whitmore</HI>'s and <HI>Bragg</HI>'s grenadiers behaved very well on this occa&s;ion. Lord <HI>Dundonald</HI> was killed. Lieut. <HI>Tew</HI> wounded and taken pri&s;oner, Capt. <HI>Bontein,</HI> of the engineers, taken pri&s;oner: 1 cor|poral, 3 men killed; 12 mi&s;&s;ing; 17 men woun|ed. The &s;ally was of five picquets, &s;upported by 600 men; a captain, <HI>Chevalier de Chavelin,</HI> was killed; a lieutenant wounded and taken pri&s;oner; 17 men killed; 4 wounded, and bro't off pri&s;oners; be&s;ides what woun|ded they carried into the town: one of which, a captain, died immediately. The enemy &s;ent out a flag of truce to bury their dead, which when over, the cannonading be|gan again. The frigate was &s;o hurt, &s;he hauled clo&s;e to the town; the &s;hips fired very much again&s;t Brigadier <HI>Wolfe's</HI> batteries.</P>
<P>The 10th the road at the epaulement went on a little better; the enemy fired a great deal, and threw many &s;hells.</P>
<P>The 11th a waggoner was taken off by &s;ome Indians, between the block-hou&s;e and the left of the north-ea&s;t harbour.</P>
<P>The 12th it rained very hard all night; not a man in the detachment could have a dry thread on; we made an advanced work to Green-Hill; at night the waggoner who had been taken, luckily made his e&s;cape; &s;aid, they were 250 Canadians. The citadel ba&s;tion fired very &s;martly.</P>

<P>The 13th the enemy threw a great many &s;hells; we perfected our works as fa&s;t as we could; had rainy wea|ther; the enemy was at work at <HI>Cape Noir,</HI> to hinder our taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion near that point, which is of no con|&s;equence; &s;ome de&s;erters came in &s;aid a &s;loop from <HI>Miray,</HI> got in three days ago.</P>
<P>The 14th, the batteries were traced out la&s;t night with an intention to place twenty 24-pounders, divided in four different batteries, to de&s;troy the defences: and a battery of 7 mortars, with &s;ome twelve-pounders, to ricohet the works and the town.</P>
<P>The 15th the cannonading and firing continued; the enemy tried to throw &s;ome &s;hells into camp, &s;up|po&s;ed to be intended again&s;t our powder magazines: At ten at night the light-hou&s;e battery fired &s;ome rockets as a &s;ignal of &s;hips &s;ailing out of the harbour; Sir Charles Hardy an&s;wered it; the frigate got out, and Sir Charles Hardy's Fleet got under &s;ail and went to &s;ea. Before day-break, Capt. Sutherland, po&s;ted at the end of the north-ea&s;t harbour, was attacked, and there was a great deal of firing; the grenadiers of Brigadier Wolfe's corps marched to &s;u&s;tain him, and all the light infantry; it was over before they could get up, and, by a di&s;erter from the enemy, they were only 100 men come from <HI>Miray,</HI> where they left Mon&s;. <HI>de Boisbiere,</HI> who had, on the other &s;ide of the water, 300 men, with boats to pa&s;s. Major <HI>Scott,</HI> with the light infantry, pur&s;ued, but could not get up with them. I encamped a corps forward.</P>
<P>The 16th, towards night, Brigadier <HI>Wolfe</HI> pu&s;hed on a corps and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hills in the front
<PB N="17" REF="008076_0016_102FD134738B7EE0">of the bara&s;oy, where we made a lodgment; the ene|my fired very bri&s;kly from the town and &s;hipping.</P>
<P>The 17th a great fire continued from the town and &s;hipping; we re&s;olved to extend the parallel from the right to the left. The fleet returned.</P>
<P>The 18th, all la&s;t night the enemy fired mu&s;ketry from the covert-way, and tried to throw &s;hells into the camp.</P>
<P>The 19th I relieved the trenches by battalions, the 14 battalions formed 3 brigades; a &s;mart fire from the covert-way; the batteries on the left fired again&s;t the ba&s;tion Dauphine with great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t one of the &s;hips in the harbour had &s;ome powder blown up in her, made a great explo&s;ion, and &s;et the &s;hip on fire, which &s;oon caught the &s;ails of two more; they burned very fa&s;t, and we kept firing on them the whole time, to try to hinder the boats and people from the town, to get to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; the Entreprenant, Capricieux, and Superb, were the three burned &s;hips; the Prudent and Bienfai&s;ant remained.</P>
<P>The 22d two batteries on the right opened with 13 24-pounders, and another with 7 mortars, and fired with great &s;ucce&s;s; the enemy fired very well from the town for &s;ome time, and threw their &s;hells into our works. Our &s;hells put the citadel in flames. I or|dered Col. <HI>William&s;on</HI> to confine his fire as much as he could to the defences of the place, that we might not de&s;troy the hou&s;es. A lieutenant of the Royal-Ameri|cans, going his rounds on an advanced po&s;t, lo&s;t his way, and was taken pri&s;oner near Cape Noir. A battery was begun on the left for four 24-pounders.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="008076_0017_102FD136058C4DA8">
<P>The 23d the cahorns were u&s;ed at night and the French mortars &s;ent to throw &s;tones from the trenches. The enemy fired all &s;orts of old iron, and any &s;tuff they could pick up. Col. <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> was out to-day for the fir&s;t time &s;ince he received the contu&s;ion. Our batteries fired with great &s;ucce&s;s. This night the &s;hells &s;et fire to the barracks, and they burnt with great violence.</P>
<P>On the 24th the fire was very bri&s;k on our &s;ide, and the enemy's decrea&s;ed. The admiral gave me 400 &s;eamen to help work at the batteries, and 200 miners added to a corps of 100 already e&s;tabli&s;hed, that we might make quick work of it, and they were imme|diately employed. The 4 gun battery opened, and another of 5 erecting. One of the men of war in the harbour, the Bienfai&s;ant, fired at our trenches at high water, and the citadel and ba&s;tion Dauphine fired again&s;t the 4 gun battery; but our men firing &s;mall-arms into the embrazures, beat the enemy off their guns.</P>
<P>The 25th the batteries fired with great &s;ucce&s;s. The admiral &s;ent me word, he intended to &s;end in boats with 600 men, to take or de&s;troy the Prudente and Bienfai&s;ant, in the harbour. I ordered all the batteries at night to fire into the works as much as po&s;&s;ible, to keep the enemy's attention to the land. The miners and workmen went on very well with their approaches to the covered way, tho' they had a con|tinued and very &s;mart fire from it, and grape &s;hot, and all &s;orts of old iron from the guns of the ramparts. We continued our fire without cea&s;ing, and a ricochet: The boats got to the &s;hips at one in the morning, and
<PB N="19" REF="008076_0018_102FD1379C6AB438">took them both: They were obliged to burn the Pru|dente, as &s;he was a-ground; and they towed off the Bienfai&s;ant to the north-ea&s;t harbour.</P>
<P>The 26th the admiral came on &s;hore, and told me he propo&s;ed &s;ending 6 &s;hips into the harbour the next day. Ju&s;t at this time I received a letter from the governor, offering to capitulate, and the articles were agreed upon. The troops remained in the trenches this night as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The 27th three companies of grenadiers, under the command of Major <HI>Farquhar,</HI> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the we&s;t gate; and I &s;ent in brigadier general <HI>Whitmore,</HI> to &s;ee the garri&s;on lay down their arms, and po&s;t the nece&s;&s;ary guards in the town, on the &s;tores, magazines, &amp;c. And I had the arms bro't out of town, and 11 colours, which I &s;end you, under the care of Captain <HI>William Amher&s;t.</HI> As I have given in orders that I de&s;ired every commanding officer of corps would ac|quaint the officers and men that I was greatly plea&s;ed with the brave and good behaviour of the troops, which has, and always mu&s;t in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s; I am to acquaint you, Sir, that I took the liberty to add to it, that I would report it to the King.</P>

<P>I Will not trouble you with a particular detail of the landing and &s;iege, but cannot help mentioning a particular gallant action in the night between the 25th and 26th in&s;tant: The boats of the &s;quadron were in two divi&s;ions detached under the command of captains <HI>Laforey</HI> and <HI>Balfour,</HI> to endeavour either to take or burn the Prudente of 74 guns, and the Bienfai&s;ant of 64, the only remaining French &s;hips in the harbour; in which they &s;ucceeded &s;o well, as to burn the former, &s;he being a-ground, and take the latter, and tow her into the N. E. harbour, notwith&s;tanding they were ex|po&s;ed to the fire of the cannon and mu&s;ketry of the i&s;land battery, point Rochefort, and the town, being favoured with a dark night. Our lo&s;s was incon&s;idera|ble, 7 men killed and 9 wounded.</P>
<P>I have given the command of the Bienfai&s;ant to Captain <HI>Balfour,</HI> and the Echo, a frigate to Captain <HI>Laforey;</HI> Mr. <HI>Affleck,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bickerton,</HI> lieutenants, who boarded the Bienfai&s;ant, &s;ucceed tho&s;e gentlemen in the Aetna fire-&s;hip, and Hunter &s;loop.</P>
<P>I have only farther to a&s;&s;ure his Maie&s;ty, that all his troops and officers, both &s;ea and land, have &s;upported the fatigue of this &s;iege with great firmne&s;s and alacrity.</P>
