<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>DR. JOHN LINING having pro&s;ecuted a cour&s;e of <HI>&s;tatical experiments,</HI> for the &s;pace of one year at Charle&s;town, the authour of the following ESSAY, became, afterwards, &s;o clo&s;ely connected with him, both by mutual intere&s;t and friend&s;hip, as gave him an opportunity to be fully informed of all he de&s;ired to know, relating to the per&s;pira|tion and other natural di&s;charges in each &s;ea&s;on. By tho&s;e means, he hath been led to judge otherwi&s;e than <HI>Sanctorius</HI> did; and it is difficult to conceive on what grounds the <HI>latter</HI> founded his notions, with re&s;pect to the numerous ill con&s;equences he imputes to an abatement of the per&s;piration alone; nor is it le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing, that &s;o many great men, &s;hould have &s;o implicitly adopted his mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>The authour hath &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>a &s;pa&s;modical contraction of the arteries and other mu&s;culous mem|branes, is the immediate cau&s;e of &s;everi&s;h di&s;orders,</HI> in whatever way this may be brought on; but
<PB N="iv" REF="010575_0005_0F80D15EE145E9F0">
&s;hould that term di&s;plea&s;e, another of the &s;ame meaning may be u&s;ed in its &s;tead; for all the &s;ymptoms in acute di&s;ea&s;es &s;how &s;omething of this &s;ort, the &s;everity or mildne&s;s of tho&s;e di&s;tempers, for the mo&s;t part keeping pace with the degree of that <HI>con&s;triction,</HI> and the number of ve&s;&s;els it affects.</P>
<P>Having oftentimes been di&s;appointed in his prac|tice, though he followed the methods recommend|ed by the be&s;t writers, &s;o far as they were under|&s;tood by him, he undertook a journal of the weather and the di&s;ea&s;es al&s;o that accompanied its changes, in the &s;everal &s;ea&s;ons, and kept the &s;ame for many years in hopes of improvement. For however ne|ce&s;&s;ary it may be, to examine our patients with great exactne&s;s at all times, it is more particularly &s;o during a pur&s;uit of this &s;ort, as well as to note every favourable and unfavourable circum&s;tance. This &s;oon di&s;covered, that when certain &s;ymptoms occurred at the beginning of a fever, the complaint, generally, was mild and of &s;hort continuance; nor would the patient be &s;eized with any inflammatory di&s;ea&s;e, though &s;uch did not fail to attack others, who &s;ickened at the &s;ame time, but without the like propitious incidents. After carefully attending to this, in great numbers of ca&s;es, the hint was not &s;lighted, for what happened of its own accord, and
<PB N="v" REF="010575_0006_0F80D15FA469DE70">
prevented &s;uch di&s;tempers, was brought on by art to remove them, after they were fixed.</P>
<P>Nothing was more wanted, than a &s;afe, &s;peedy, and, as far as the nature of things will permit, a certain method to remove fevers, within the fir&s;t or &s;econd day: This &s;urely would well de&s;erve the name of a cure; but when they are allowed to run through the &s;everal &s;tages, into which they would pa&s;s, were they left to their own cour&s;es, and the patients recover at la&s;t, all the merit that then can be pleaded is, that nothing improper had been done; and happy would it be, could this be &s;aid on all oc|ca&s;ions, for indeed there is much merit in it.</P>
<P>Were it granted, that inflammatory and other common fevers, may probably yield to the follow|ing treatment, in warm but not in cold countries, the in&s;inuation is more &s;pecious than true; for the human body is of the &s;ame con&s;truction every where, differing only in being more braced in one climate, and laxer in another. And, truly, the inhabitants of <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> vary as much in tho&s;e re&s;pects, during the winter and &s;ummer, as if they dwelt in climates the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite in temperature. Be&s;ides, the &s;ame di&s;temper will be much alike in its &s;ymp|toms
<PB N="vi" REF="010575_0007_0F80D160767EF550">
and events, and, therefore, mu&s;t require the &s;ame management, or nearly &s;o, in all places.</P>
<P>The authour hath practi&s;ed in the way hereafter laid down, for many years, and with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that he is under no apprehen&s;ions of its failing often, provided his directions be but duly followed. And having dealt candidly in publi&s;hing it, in hopes it may be of &s;ome u&s;e to the people of this province, candour requires that it &s;hould not be judged of, by the fallacious rules either of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or preju|dice, but fair experiments only. He warns the reader however, that neither this nor any other me|thod will at all times cure; for every one of the pro|fe&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t have found in the cour&s;e of his prac|tice, that &s;omewhat of a hidden nature now and then occurs, even in the complaints he thought him&s;elf be&s;t acquainted with, which, in &s;pite of his boa&s;ted &s;agacity, di&s;appointed him. Whether this depended on certain &s;ingularities in the con&s;titutions of individual per&s;ons, the nature of the di&s;temper it&s;elf, or his own over&s;ights, it might not be po&s;&s;ible for him to di&s;cover; or even if he could, it might not then be in his power to remedy it.</P>
<P>It was deemed &s;ufficient to point out the method, and mention the medicines to be u&s;ed, without de|termining their proportions, or when it may be pro|per,
<PB N="vii" REF="010575_0008_0F80D16121F2AC80">
either to omit, or prefer any one of them to another; for every practitioner ought to know, how they &s;hould be adju&s;ted to the different ages and con&s;titutions of his patients.</P>
<P>At the end of this is another ESSAY on the <HI>Cri&s;es</HI> of Fevers, which is intended to confirm the rea&s;on|ing contained in the former; by &s;howing that a <HI>cri&s;is</HI> could not happen, unle&s;s the fluids had fir&s;t been too much accumulated, in or near the places, whence the di&s;charges called <HI>critical</HI> proceed, in con&s;equence of &s;ome hinderance to a free circulation in other parts.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> In which we propo&s;e to enquire, whether an abatement of the per&s;piration be, indeed, the cau&s;e of &s;o many di&s;tempers as are commonly imputed to it.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Sanctorius</HI> proved that our bodies per|&s;pire freely, he &s;eemed to have no knowledge of their imbibing any thing from without, excepting <HI>air,</HI> and therefore was not aware, that his experiments di&s;|covered no more, than the difference between the per|&s;piration, and moi&s;ture we ab&s;orb through the pores of the &s;kin and lungs; but exhalation and ab&s;orption &s;o confound each other, as makes it extremely difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to a&s;certain the true &s;um of either. We may be a&s;&s;ured, however, that the di&s;charges from the
<PB N="10" REF="010575_0011_0F80D163656691D8">
lungs and outer &s;urface, are greater than &s;uch trials &s;how them to be; &s;ince no allowance is made for whatever we imbibe, which, pa&s;t all doubts, mu&s;t be very con&s;iderable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A negro man who had eaten or drank but little for &s;ome days before he was gibbetted at Charle&s;town in March 1759, and had nothing given him after|ward, regularly voided a large quantity of urine early every morning; but he di&s;|charged no more till about the &s;ame hour next day. The rea&s;on undoubtedly was, that &s;o long as the &s;un was above the horizon and warmed the air, per&s;piration was freer, becau&s;e the fluids were more determined towards the &s;kin thereby; but as it became colder and more damp withal in the night, the outward &s;urface was then con&s;tricted, and the humours, con&s;equently, being repelled towards the <HI>vi&s;cera,</HI> urine was increa&s;ed, the moi&s;ture ab&s;orbed furni&s;hing matter for it.</NOTE>. When, therefore, that authour found his weight increa&s;ed, he always charged it to &s;o much of the per&s;piration being detained; and a&s;cribed to &s;uch accidents almo&s;t every di&s;ea&s;e to which mankind is liable. But this could only be a &s;uppo&s;ititious inference, for it cannot be thought that he experienced all tho&s;e ill con&s;equences in him&s;elf; and to apply the re&s;ult of ex|periments, which concerned him alone, to whatever hap|pened to others, in whom that, as well as all the other di&s;charges, might have proceeded in a very different man|ner, was &s;tretching the conclu&s;ion rather too far. In|deed, we owe much to <HI>Sanctorius,</HI> but, &s;till, there is no need to admit his mi&s;takes; for it is in part owing to this conde&s;cen&s;ion, that I know not what <HI>attenuants</HI> and <HI>&s;u|dorificks</HI> have been introduced into the practice, in order to di&s;&s;olve &s;ome notional vi&s;cidne&s;s of the fluids, and promote &s;weats in fevers; for on tho&s;e two effects, the removal of mo&s;t acute di&s;ea&s;es is thought chiefly to depend, though one of them acts in direct contradiction to the other.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="010575_0012_0F80D1641FE68100">Some men of great reputation have likewi&s;e adopted <HI>Sanctorius</HI>'s a&s;&s;ertion, that five-eighths of all our food and drink ought to pa&s;s by per&s;piration; but this rule can|not hold in any country, where cold and warm &s;ea&s;ons &s;ucceed each other, whatever may happen at times du|ring the &s;ummer. Nor is it le&s;s an errour to maintain, that the daily &s;um of all the di&s;charges, &s;hould equal the quantity of our diet and drink, to keep up the &s;ame weight of body, that we may enjoy health. For to an&s;wer that great end, tho&s;e excretions mu&s;t vary at different times of the year; and therefore, no fixed weight can be a&s;&s;igned for the &s;tandard of health; becau&s;e that which would be mo&s;t proper at one &s;ea&s;on, might be dangerous in the highe&s;t degree at another, as will ap|pear in the cour&s;e of this e&s;&s;ay. It &s;eems, indeed, that this great per&s;piration was meant as nece&s;&s;ary, only, in the &s;ummer; for from the <HI>autumnal equinox</HI> to the <HI>winter &s;ol&s;tice,</HI> him&s;elf informs us, that it &s;carcely exceeded one pound, or was about, one-fifth part of what it had been at another time: yet he does not complain of any di&s;|orders from &s;o remarkable a difference therein, for cer|tainly this abatement happened by degrees; and in all likelihood it might have continued thus &s;mall through|out the month of January and for a good part of Feb|ruary. In general, as the weather is cooler and more changeable in the &s;pring and autumn than in &s;ummer, per&s;piration not only mu&s;t be le&s;s then, but more vari|able al&s;o. How dangerous therefore, or at lea&s;t trouble|&s;ome and difficult mu&s;t it be, to follow his rule for the pre&s;ervation of health, by reducing the body in the &s;pring to the weight it &s;hould be of in &s;ummer, and keeping it to that poi&s;e. But this rea&s;oning would equally
<PB N="12" REF="010575_0013_0F80D1673325EEE0">
hold, for pre&s;erving the like weight of body in winter, as during a warm &s;ea&s;on, by promoting per&s;piration to the &s;ame quantity in the former period, that it ought to be in the latter. He, moreover, &s;ays, that they would enjoy the be&s;t health, and might attain extreme age, who keep their bodies from varying <HI>much</HI> in weight. Under what limitations <HI>much</HI> is to be under&s;tood here, I know not; but we are well a&s;&s;ured, that the per&s;pira|tion ought to increa&s;e with the heat of the air; el&s;e, we could not live, much le&s;s enjoy health, during very warm weather <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Lining</HI> began to fall away in March, and by the end of September lo&s;t &s;eventeen pounds weight, but he regained that and more, before the end of February following.</NOTE>. For as the fiery particles enter our bodies along with the watery ones, and, perhaps, &s;ome portion of the air it&s;elf, unle&s;s the fluids were at the &s;ame time con&s;tantly venting, according to the expan&s;ions they are made to undergo, and al&s;o to free us of this unnatural heat, &s;uch a general overfulne&s;s mu&s;t &s;oon en&s;ue, as would di&s;tend the ve&s;&s;els, pa&s;t all power of contracting them|&s;elves; in&s;tances of which happen almo&s;t every &s;ummer to &s;ome people in Carolina. This profu&s;e per&s;piration is therefore ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, during a &s;ultry &s;ea&s;on, to pre&s;erve a balance, between the much relaxed ve&s;&s;els, and highly rarified fluids. Hence it appears, that our bodies are con&s;tantly di&s;charging the heat they ab&s;orb from without; and &s;o languid do the vital actions be|come, that whil&s;t we &s;weat freely as we ought to do, our natural heat is really le&s;s after the &s;ummer is far ad|vanced, than in winter. In January 1752, when the mercury fell to the 18th divi&s;ion, it ro&s;e in a &s;mall ther|mometer placed under my arm, to the 97th; but in July
<PB N="13" REF="010575_0014_0F80D168B280C988">
that &s;ame year, when the heat of the &s;haded air was marked by the 101&s;t degree, it did not ri&s;e in the &s;ame &s;ituation, above the 95th. It was ju&s;t now &s;aid, that we could not live when the weather is very warm, unle&s;s the per&s;piration increa&s;ed in proportion as the fluids were ratified. Accordingly, I &s;ometimes have been &s;ent for to people who were expiring, in a manner, from being too long expo&s;ed to the inten&s;e heat of the &s;un, and others were already dead before I could reach them, though but a few doors from me. The fir&s;t &s;ymptoms perceived on the&s;e occa&s;ions, are an univer&s;al languid|ne&s;s and a fainti&s;h &s;ort of drow&s;ine&s;s; pre&s;ently &s;uch a tightne&s;s is felt round the brea&s;t as if it were &s;trongly girded, &s;o that the per&s;on can &s;carcely breathe; and then but &s;lowly. Soon after he falls, as it were, into a pro|found &s;leep; from which if he cannot be &s;peedily rou&s;ed, death quickly follows. In &s;uch ca&s;es, I commonly found the &s;kin rather dry and very hot; the countenance full and flu&s;hed; all the outward veins very much di&s;tended; and on the brea&s;t, and other places, inflammations might be perceived, as in the <HI>&s;carlet fever,</HI> or a &s;light <HI>ery&s;ipelas,</HI> the whole body appearing enlarged and fuller than in health; but the redne&s;s we &s;peak of in the &s;kin, only happened a little while before the patient's death. The putrefaction in tho&s;e who die after this manner, is always &s;udden and great; which makes it nece&s;&s;ary to bury them in a few hours; nor does the heat their bodies acquired, abate &s;o much after death as in other carca&s;&s;es, for the time they lie uninterred. But the&s;e things by the bye&mdash;</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Lining</HI> (who was very exact) &s;ometimes found him&s;elf heavier by &s;everal ounces, than he was a few
<PB N="14" REF="010575_0015_0F80D169741626F8">
hours before, though he per&s;pired &s;en&s;ibly all the while, from &s;everal parts of his body, be&s;ides what pa&s;&s;ed from the lungs; hence it &s;eems, that per&s;piration and ab&s;orp|tion may both go on freely together: But he often times abated the per&s;piration de&s;ignedly, without any perceive|able injury, &s;o that the matter detained, either was not &s;o pernicious as is commonly thought, or his body mu&s;t have been quickly freed of it by &s;ome other di&s;charge. So earne&s;t was he to know what might be the con&s;e|quence of checking this &s;uddenly that he &s;ome times ex|po&s;ed him&s;elf at once to the wind, when &s;weating profu&s;ely. But this curio&s;ity was not always gratified without di&s;|agreeable effects. In particular, at the beginning of July, having only an open thin linen wai&s;tcoat over his &s;hirt, he &s;at from eleven to noon in a clo&s;e room where the heat was marked by the 87th degree of Fahrenheit's ther|mometer; and in that one hour per&s;piring eleven and an half ounces, he in&s;tantly removed into an open pa&s;&s;age through which the wind blew bri&s;kly, the mercury fal|ling there to 82; and in one hour and a quarter gained &s;ix and an half ounces, though he &s;till &s;weated from &s;ome parts. The whole of this mu&s;t &s;urely be charged to ab|&s;orption, and con&s;i&s;ted either of the per&s;piration with which his linen was damped, or elementary water im|bibed from the air, not more than 13 or 14 degrees colder than his blood, which of it&s;elf, was not likely to do much harm. However, let us even grant that &s;ome of the per&s;piration was detained here, yet the quantity thereof, together with whatever el&s;e was ab&s;orbed, did not occa&s;ion any great fulne&s;s or <HI>plethora;</HI> nor could a pu|tre&s;cence en&s;ue immediately. But &s;uch experiments were un&s;afe on another &s;eere; and this we &s;peak of, was pre|&s;ently
<PB N="15" REF="010575_0016_0F80D16A2F3645F0">
followed by gripings, and a painful wearine&s;s chiefly affecting the legs, knees and thighs; however tho&s;e &s;ymptoms went off on his having &s;ome plentiful &s;tools. Were not tho&s;e effects owing to the &s;udden &s;trong con&s;trictions which the outward ve&s;&s;els and membranes were made to undergo, by the cooler air; the hinderance thence ari&s;ing to the motion of the blood through tho&s;e parts, from which it was repelled and made to accumulate in the abdominal vi&s;cera; where, happily, for him, the &s;ecretions were &s;oon increa&s;ed &s;o as to vent off the redun|dant humours? Let tho&s;e who can judge of the laws that obtain in the animal oeconomy determine this que&s;tion.&mdash;</P>
<P>Per&s;piration can never be &s;topped in a living body; and the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for di&s;ea&s;es from an abatement of it are, that not only a <HI>plethora</HI> is thereby brought on, but the humour it&s;elf is &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o putre&s;cent, as makes it in the highe&s;t degree dangerous, to have any part there|of detained, even for a &s;hort time. Were it, indeed, true, that five-eighths of our food and drink ought to pa&s;s that way, and were it po&s;&s;ible that this di&s;charge could be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed for a number of days together, the appetite continuing good all the while, alarming overfulne&s;&s;es undoubtedly would en&s;ue, unle&s;s the other excretions increa&s;ed according as the per&s;piration dimini&s;hed.

<P>We &s;hall by and by enquire, whether the per&s;piration and urine be not nearly, if not quite the &s;ame, with this difference, however, that the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration may not contain &s;uch gro&s;s <HI>&s;aline, &s;ul|phureous</HI> and <HI>earthy</HI> parts as pa&s;s by urine. Whence then does the latter derive &s;o de|leterious a di&s;po&s;ition, for all tho&s;e con|tents exi&s;ted before in the fluids when the per&s;on was in health; and the like principles are al&s;o found in the other ex|cretions, of the be&s;t regulated con&s;titu|tions? Neither will the &s;uppo&s;al avail, that, as being a humour of the la&s;t <HI>con|nection,</HI> it, for that rea&s;on, mu&s;t be the mo&s;t <HI>putre&s;cent,</HI> for, even in this re&s;pect, it is only on a foot with the other natural di&s;charges; which being &s;everally &s;ecreted and excreted in the due order of time, mu&s;t therefore be perfectly concocted. It ought, however, to be ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e contents of the urine only appeared in the above manner after they were concen|trated, and perhaps heightened by the great heat u&s;ed in &s;uch proce&s;&s;es; but were much le&s;s active, when diffu&s;ed throughout the circulating fluids.</P>
<P>I would further take notice, that per|&s;piration is, perhaps, the only di&s;charge that cannot be wholly &s;topped, as the urine and &s;tools often times are for &s;everal days together, without very dangerous con&s;equences; and both may be taken up again by the ve&s;&s;els, and circulate a new with the fluids, as already hath been &s;aid. In drop&s;ies, be the patient's drink ever &s;o plentiful, little urine will be ex|creted in proportion; &s;o that whatever ought to have pa&s;&s;ed that way, mu&s;t in &s;uch ca&s;es be lodged in the <HI>cellular mem|brane,</HI> or cavities of the body, together with the <HI>&s;erous</HI> parts of the blood, where they may continue &s;tagnated, for &s;ome months, without fatal effects. When, therefore, a patient recovers from a drop&s;y, nothing &s;eems more plain, than that the humours which had lain &s;o long in a &s;tate of re&s;t, mu&s;t fir&s;t be ab&s;orbed, before they can either be expelled through any of the excreting organs, or a&s;&s;imilated again in the cour&s;e of circulation, as the ve&s;&s;els recover &s;trength. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay much of tho&s;e <HI>extrava&s;ations</HI> that happen from contu&s;ions, in which the blood that had for many days been deprived of mo|tion, is again di&s;&s;olved and ab&s;orbed, with|out any injury, though the contrary might be expected; for here as well as in a drop&s;y, &s;ome degree of <HI>putrefaction</HI> might be looked for. But as there are &s;mall and often times no evidences at all thereof on tho&s;e and many other occa|&s;ions, I have thought <HI>that</HI> term was fre|quently <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> with in &s;peaking of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></P></NOTE>.

days, before they are &s;o generally tainted thereby to pro|duce a fever, in order to expel the <HI>morbifick</HI> cau&s;e: And the &s;ame, probably, may be &s;aid of other contagious di&s;ea&s;es, though we cannot always a&s;certain the exact time, when the patients received the fir&s;t &s;eeds of the&s;e di&s;orders. But if a per&s;on in health, happens to &s;icken pre&s;ently after going out of a warm room into the open air, the mode is to impute the di&s;temper to a check of the per&s;piration; whereas in truth, we ought to look for another cau&s;e for &s;uch &s;udden violent effects.</P>
<P>But were the matter we per&s;pire really &s;o di&s;po&s;ed to putrefaction, it might with rea&s;on be expected, that having brought on a fever of many days, it would in that time become &s;o putrid, (from the many circum|&s;tances which then concurred to make it &s;o) that it would give better proofs thereof, than it commonly does. Yet we are &s;eldom &s;en&s;ible of much acrimony in the fluids, as they pa&s;s &s;o many fine irritable canals in their way to the &s;kin, either before or during the <HI>critical &s;weat,</HI> though <HI>that</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to free the body of the <HI>morbifick</HI> cau&s;e, which, according to the <HI>Sanctorian doctrine,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of &s;omewhat very <HI>acrid,</HI> or de&s;tructive of health.

Nor would the urinary organs be exempt from the like effects, &s;o that the expultion of the <HI>febrifick matter</HI> would be prevented either way.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010575_0020_0F80D16D2C3C5740">The advantages ari&s;ing from poultices and fomenta|tions, and the &s;preading of contagious di&s;ea&s;es, among other things, plainly prove, that we receive the &s;teams which exhale from other bodies. It is al&s;o true that each individual per&s;on in a large company, may, without any pre&s;ent or future inconveniency, imbibe &s;ome of the per&s;piration which was di&s;charged from a great number of people, of very different con&s;titutions, even after it had been diffu&s;ed in the mo&s;t promi&s;cuous manner, through the heated air of a room. But when any per&s;on &s;ickens, after being in &s;o crowded an a&s;&s;embly (where he &s;weated profu&s;ely), the rea&s;on commonly given is this plain, and not le&s;s true one, that he was injured by going out of a warm apartment into the cool damp air, heated as he then was.</P>
<P>But, there are fevers which attack, when no &s;en&s;ible abatement of the per&s;piration can be impeached; on the contrary, it proceeded freely, &s;ometimes too profu&s;ely, before they came on, and continued plentiful, or with &s;hort interruptions only, throughout tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. And we likewi&s;e know, that this di&s;charge is &s;mall, for &s;everal months together, at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, with great advantage to many. On the whole, we have good grounds to be|lieve, that neither this nor any of the other natural ex|cretions, are limited to exact or &s;tated rules, but vary not only in different people at the &s;ame time, but even in the &s;ame men daily, who yet enjoy health.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Lining</HI>'s tables &s;hew, that when the urine was greate&s;t, per&s;piration was always lea&s;t, and the contrary. Hence it &s;eems, that in countries where hot and cold
<PB N="20" REF="010575_0021_0F80D16DF98985D0">
weather &s;ucceed each other, the fluids are determined in a fuller &s;tream toward the &s;kin at one &s;ea&s;on, and are again more repelled into the <HI>vi&s;cera</HI> at another. For this rea&s;on, the di&s;charges from within or through the out|ward pores, mu&s;t increa&s;e or dimini&s;h by turns, accord|ing as the humours are more or le&s;s directed one way or the other. The difference therefore between the urine and per&s;piration, might not be great at the year's end, as Dr. <HI>Lining</HI> di&s;covered, though the exce&s;s was in favour of the former, becau&s;e the weather was uncommonly cool, during the twelve months he made his experiments.</P>
<P>As &s;uch a conformity appears in the quantity of tho&s;e two di&s;charges, the augmentation of one &s;eems intended to make up for any defect in the other, which mu&s;t of cour&s;e happen on a change in the weather. They al&s;o are the be&s;t &s;uited to an&s;wer the great end of becoming &s;ub&s;titutes for each other, as being the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all the excretions. And though one may not increa&s;e exactly, in the &s;ame proportion as the other le&s;&s;ens, yet they &s;eem to act reciprocally as counterpoi&s;es, when the weight of the fluids and &s;trength of the ve&s;&s;els are pretty well adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>To &s;hew the truth of what hath been &s;aid, of the dif|ference in tho&s;e two di&s;charges during hot and cold weather, let us take the <HI>medium</HI> of the per&s;piration for twenty-four hours in July, and compare this with its mean quantity for the &s;ame &s;pace of time in February, they will then re&s;pectively be as eighty-&s;even to thirty-&s;even: A plain proof how greatly the per&s;piring ve&s;&s;els were dilated, and how much more plentiful was the flow
<PB N="21" REF="010575_0022_0F80D16EA4264D90" MS="y">
of the fluids towards the outward arteries in the &s;ummer than in winter. Again, if the mean quantity of the urine for twenty-four hours in February, be compared with its medium al&s;o for the &s;ame time in July, they will be as &s;eventy-eight to forty-four nearly. The difference therefore between the greate&s;t per&s;piration in &s;ummer, and mo&s;t urine in the winter, does not exceed nine ounces in twenty-four hours: But the difference be|tween the &s;malle&s;t per&s;piration, and lea&s;t urine in the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite &s;ea&s;ons, was no more that &s;even ounces; an amazing corre&s;pondence! though to the unthinking part of mankind, tho&s;e things pa&s;s unheeded, as if they bore no &s;ort of proportion.</P>
<P>But a greater agreement &s;till appears between tho&s;e two &s;ecretions than re&s;ults merely from &s;uch a conformity in their quantities, by which they &s;eem intended to &s;up|ply each others defects at different times of the year. And if they really do &s;o, as is likely beyond a bare pro|bability, it ought to follow, that the matter which pa&s;&s;es both ways, &s;hould be nearly, if not quite the &s;ame; and that it is, an ea&s;y experiment will &s;how. For, if a &s;mall quantity of the per&s;piration from the lungs, be collected by blowing in a clean wine gla&s;s, and &s;ome urine is made in another, (both being taken fa&s;ting, or before the hu|mours have been diluted with fre&s;h <HI>chyle</HI>), any per&s;on having an acute ta&s;te and &s;mell, will at once pronounce that both are urine. Should a little &s;alt of tartar be ad|ded to each, a &s;lightly volatile, but not di&s;agreeable, &s;mell will ari&s;e from both; and if they be permitted to &s;tand for a day, without having any thing mingled with them, a more acrid ta&s;te and &s;cent will then be perceived; the

For what per&s;pires from behind the ears, from the gums, arm-pits, groins and be|tween the toes, hath a raneid offen&s;ive &s;mell, which differs in each place. So that could the whole per&s;piration be col|lected together, there is no room to doubt, it would make a mixture, full as acrimonious as the urine is.</NOTE>. Moreover, no|thing &s;eems more plain, than that tho&s;e &s;alts which pa&s;s with the urine in temperate &s;ea&s;ons, are di&s;charged through the &s;kin when the weather is very warm; for black gloves which have been worn, in &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, till they were wet with &s;weat, will be covered with a cru&s;t of white &s;alt when dry; and our &s;weat al&s;o has the &s;ame &s;alti&s;h ta&s;te. What we then per&s;pire, &s;mells at fir&s;t as fre&s;h blood; but after &s;ome hours, it communicates a urinous &s;cent and yellow colour to our linen: So that if tho&s;e things do not amount to a full proof, they make it extremely probable, that the per&s;piration and urine, free the body in different ways of much the &s;ame &s;ort of matter; and that what per&s;pires from the outward &s;ur|face and lungs, is the &s;ame as urine in the kidneys. The pores of the &s;kin are &s;o many channels, intended to clear the external parts of whatever hath become u&s;ele&s;s and unfit to be detained there; the lungs and pa&s;&s;ages leading to them, perform the &s;ame office for the brea&s;t and neighbouring parts; the kidneys and inte&s;tines doing the like for the lower <HI>vi&s;cera;</HI> &s;o that, according to their various &s;ituations, they &s;everally contribute to the &s;ame great ends. And, though the chief excretions &s;eem to go on without any e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, in various climates, and in the inhabitants of the &s;ame country, at dif|ferent &s;ea&s;ons, or even in the &s;ame per&s;ons from day to

<P>Were it indeed true, that a <HI>pletbora</HI> from an abate|ment of the per&s;piration mu&s;t of cour&s;e happen, before inflammatory fevers can attack, it might be expected, that &s;uch di&s;orders would be mo&s;t common in the &s;um|mer, becau&s;e a much greater quantity thereof may be de|tained in a &s;hort time, <HI>that di&s;charge</HI> being then greate&s;t, and the fibres very lax and irritable, which renders them &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;trong &s;pa&s;modick contractions from &s;light|er cau&s;es. It, however, falls out quite otherwi&s;e, for &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es &s;eldom appear with us at that &s;ea&s;on, but mo&s;tly in the winter and &s;pring, when per&s;piration is little, and, con&s;equently, le&s;s likely to produce the over|fulne&s;s &s;o much contended for. But at no time can &s;uch an addition be made to the circulating fluids thereby, in any equal number of hours, as by eating and drinking plentifully, and even intemperately, according to the daily cu&s;tom of many, without much inconveniency, at lea&s;t, for the pre&s;ent, though &s;everal pounds of fre&s;h chyle, the produce, perhaps, of an ill judged mixture of meats and drinks, pa&s;s into their ve&s;&s;els oftener than once in the day. It may probably be &s;aid here, that the excretions are &s;till going on, and therefore, whatever overfulne&s;s may happen from &s;uch exce&s;&s;es, are abate|ing every moment. But is not this equally true on a diminution of the per&s;piration? for though the out|ward pores may be occa&s;ionally &s;traitened, yet that di&s;|charge is &s;till proceeding from the lungs, and it may be
<PB N="24" REF="010575_0025_0F80D1719EA48F08">
more plentifully, becau&s;e a greater quantity of blood mu&s;t circulate through that organ in all fevers, &s;uppo&s;e|ing no hemorrhage or any exce&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of the ab|dominal &s;ecretions happens in the mean time; be&s;ides that urine al&s;o is commonly augmented at &s;uch times; &s;o that per&s;piration is the only di&s;charge who&s;e defects can be compen&s;ated by another channel. It hath been &s;aid, that no great plethora can happen from an interception of the per&s;piration; yet, for the &s;ake of argument, let us even grant, that &s;omewhat of an overfulne&s;s may at times en&s;ue from that cau&s;e; but then might we not ex|pect this would be removed, and that the fever it occa|&s;ioned ought to cea&s;e, after repeated bleedings, &s;weatings and the like evacuations &s;o commonly made in &s;uch ca&s;es; more e&s;pecially as the appetite fails for every thing, ex|cept drink or thin nouri&s;hment, which &s;oon pa&s;&s;es off. Neverthele&s;s the di&s;ea&s;e too often continues, though the patient is &s;o emptied, that he can &s;carcely be known. Be&s;ides, nothing is &s;o notorious, as that the body &s;ome|times is exceedingly wa&s;ted by a fever of a few days, though no artificial evacuations had been made, and little pa&s;&s;ed by any of the &s;en&s;ible di&s;charges; the patient al&s;o having all this while been well &s;upplied with &s;uitable diet. No way then remains to account for this great lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance, but by &s;uppo&s;ing the per&s;piration to have been va&s;tly increa&s;ed, from the lungs mo&s;tly, for the &s;kin, tongue and throat, are at times dry and parched on tho&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Whether tho&s;e things will be con&s;idered in the &s;ame light by others, I know not; but to me it &s;eems, that whatever <HI>plethora</HI> may en&s;ue, from a temporary and

partial check of the per&s;piration (for partial it mu&s;t be), cannot of it&s;elf &s;o often bring on a fever, as already hath been &s;aid, if it can at all. For according to <HI>Sanctorius</HI> him&s;elf, were the whole of it detained, it would only make an addition of one pound to the fluids in twenty-four hours, from the autumnal equinox to the winter &s;ol&s;tice; or of thirty-&s;even ounces in the &s;pace of one day and night in February, according to Dr. <HI>Lining;</HI> and &s;uppo&s;ing &s;till, which yet can &s;carcely be, that the whole of this were matter that ought to have per&s;pired, without any addition being made to it, by the moi&s;ture ab&s;orbed from the air. However, this is only mentioned in order to give the argument its full &s;cope, but without admitting that an entire &s;top can po&s;&s;ibly be put to the per&s;piration, &s;o long as the humours circulate at all.</P>
<P>If a dangerous overfulne&s;s cannot well ari&s;e from a detention of the per&s;piration, in the common cour&s;e of things, as little is its &s;uppo&s;ed pronene&s;s to putrefaction likely to bring on a violent di&s;ea&s;e &s;o &s;uddenly, as often|times happens to people who, but a few hours before, were healthy and &s;trong; for &s;urely it is difficult to con|ceive, how either the quantity or quality of that fluid which might occa&s;ionally be intercepted, could excite &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and hazardous effects in &s;o &s;mall a time. I would a&s;k tho&s;e who maintain the doctrine we have been cen&s;uring, Whether it can fairly be imputed to an abatement of the per&s;piration, that a per&s;on on going out of a warm room into the cool moi&s;t air, or that the man who drinks cold water, or &s;its down on the damp ground when he is much heated with exerci&s;e, &s;hall immediately &s;hiver, and have a fever, pleuri&s;y, or quin&s;y?

That one who plunges him&s;elf into the water whil&s;t he is &s;weating freely, &s;hall in&s;tantly become rigid, in&s;en|&s;ible and die in a few hours? or that tho&s;e who are ex|po&s;ed to rain in the &s;ummer, or &s;leep only for a little while out of doors at night during that &s;ea&s;on, &s;hall pre|&s;ently be cramped al over, and have a <HI>tetanus,</HI> or &s;ome other dangerous di&s;ea&s;e?

<P>THOUGH it be not the lot of man to enjoy con|&s;tant health, many per&s;ons however are happily en|dowed with &s;uch well con&s;tructed con&s;titutions, that, for a number of years together, the ve&s;&s;els every where have proper &s;trength, and continue &s;o flexible withal, that the fluids they contain, can pa&s;s freely from the heart to all parts of the body, and return without any hinderance to that organ. Under circum&s;tances like the&s;e, every part receives only its natural proportion of the blood; the &s;everal &s;ecretions and excretions will be made in regular order; and as no redundance can happen, &s;o nothing will fall &s;hort, till the equality of action and re-action that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the &s;olids and fluids is interrupted; and then the <HI>natural, vital and ani|mal functions</HI> mu&s;t be di&s;ordered in proportion. It therefore &s;eems plain that when any man is attacked with a fever, in whom the con&s;titution was &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed immediately before, the fault could not have been in the fluids; for they neither exceeded in quantity, nor erred in quality, but in the ve&s;&s;els alone, owing to &s;ome change in the condition of their coats; for, pa&s;t all doubts, they are not now in the &s;ame &s;tate as before; and according to the alteration they have undergone, &s;o mu&s;t more or le&s;s of di&s;order en&s;ue in the di&s;tribution of the blood, and con&s;equently in all things that depend on its regular circulation.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="010575_0029_0F80D1763A6A1A00">I know but two ways, in which the equality of mutual action between the &s;olids and fluids can be broken in upon, or, in other words, that a di&s;ea&s;e can happen; namely, when the ve&s;&s;els are &s;o di&s;tended by an un|natural rarefaction of the humours, that they cannot cir|culate freely; but &s;uch an expan&s;ion &s;eldom occa&s;ions a di&s;temper in temperate climates; and mu&s;t then be owing to too much heat, a clo&s;e confined air, or &s;uch as does not gravitate &s;ufficiently, whence &s;udden death &s;ometimes en&s;ues. Nor does any thing prevent the blood from being expanded by the natural heat of our bodies, &s;o as to de&s;troy us, but that this is checked and kept within bounds by the &s;uperiour &s;pring of the ve&s;|&s;els. Di&s;orders of this &s;ort, however, not being the &s;ub|ject of our pre&s;ent inquiry, we &s;hall pa&s;s to the other, which is by far the mo&s;t common cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>It is very &s;ingular, that almo&s;t every fever &s;hould be preceeded by a &s;en&s;e of coldne&s;s in &s;ome degree; and the greater this, and longer its continuance, the more dangerous for the mo&s;t part is the di&s;order. This chil|line&s;s may come on &s;uddenly; but, more frequently, the patient hath &s;ucce&s;&s;ive chills and flu&s;hings, perhaps, for &s;ome days; and in the mean time, an irk&s;ome &s;ort of wearine&s;s is perceived, chiefly about the legs, knees and thighs, together with a li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the other parts, and of the mind al&s;o; yet, all this while, the pul&s;e, though &s;omewhat hard, may not be much quickened. Tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations of coldne&s;s, return oftener and continue longer, more e&s;pecially if the per&s;on expo&s;es him&s;elf to the wind; and the other &s;ymptoms likewi&s;e increa&s;e, till at la&s;t a &s;trong &s;hivering or <HI>horror</HI> comes on. At this

time the hands and feet are cold, the veins which lie immediately under the &s;kin di&s;appear, and the face to|gether with all the other outward parts are pale, and, as it were, &s;hrunk or contracted. An in&s;atiable thir&s;t at|tends; a painful &s;tiffne&s;s is felt in the joints and all the external mu&s;cles; but &s;till mo&s;t &s;everely from the hips downwards. And as the fluids are now made to accu|mulate in the internal and &s;uperiour parts, a &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, anxiety, quick-breathing, and head-ach en|&s;ue, with great heat about the <HI>epiga&s;trium,</HI> brea&s;t and forehead, which, after &s;ome time, diffu&s;&s;es it&s;elf over the body and limbs, &s;o proper care be taken. The pul&s;e is confu&s;ed, &s;mall, hard and very quick during the <HI>horror;</HI> but it becomes &s;omewhat fuller, more &s;oft and &s;low when the cold fit cea&s;es: Yet it is common for the &s;ick to be more or le&s;s chilly at times, throughout every acute di&s;ea&s;e, at all &s;ea&s;ons, more e&s;pecially on turning in bed, or when the clothes are lifted up, &s;o as to admit the cool air to the &s;kin.</P>
<P>If I judge rightly, the above &s;ymptoms clearly &s;how, that the motion of the fluids is in &s;ome mea&s;ure inter|cepted in mo&s;t, if not all, the outward ve&s;&s;els and mu&s;|cles; the &s;mall contracted pul&s;e, points out &s;ome fault in the coats of the arteries, which are too much braced to per|mit the blood either to enter or pa&s;s them freely; and the palene&s;s of the face and &s;hrinking of all the outward parts likewi&s;e make it evident, that the &s;kin together with the contiguous membranes are &s;pa&s;modically affected. It is no le&s;s worthy of ob&s;ervation, that this con&s;triction took place in &s;ome degree, before any perceivable quickne&s;s happened in the pul&s;e, and, likewi&s;e, that from the

time it came on, even in the &s;lighte&s;t manner, health was impaired in proportion. But the bad effects of it appeared &s;till more clearly in time of the &s;hivering; for the contraction having then not only become &s;tronger but al&s;o more general, by communicating it&s;elf to a great number of ve&s;&s;els, and other membranous parts, whatever of order &s;ub&s;i&s;ted before, in the <HI>natural, vital, and animal oeconomy,</HI> was thereby confounded. If tho&s;e things be true, as they certainly are, may we not &s;afely conclude, that the immediate cau&s;e of feveri&s;h com|plaints, is an unnatural con&s;triction of the arteries in par|ticular; and that the &s;tronger this, and the greater num|ber of ve&s;&s;els it affects, the more &s;evere mu&s;t be the di&s;temper.</P>
<P>The outward branches of the <HI>de&s;cending aorta,</HI> are probably, mo&s;t expo&s;ed to accidents of this &s;ort, from cold or moi&s;t air, as being di&s;tributed through much the greate&s;t part of the body, and conveying the blood to places mo&s;t di&s;tant from the Heart, where its <HI>velocity and momentum are &s;mall;</HI> for which rea&s;on &s;uch con&s;tric|tions may the ea&s;ier be brought on them. And we ac|cordingly find, that the heat fails fir&s;t and mo&s;t in the legs and feet; and the painful &s;tiffne&s;s is al&s;o more per|ceivable there than in other parts.</P>
<P>Whatever can give much pain or &s;timulate the nerves, &s;o as to cau&s;e them to excite &s;uch con&s;trictions, may bring on a fever. But we do not &s;uppo&s;e all the arteries mu&s;t be thus affected, to produce the di&s;ea&s;e, it being fully &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e, that &s;o many of them &s;hould be &s;o di&s;ordered, as will occa&s;ion an irregular

di&s;tribution of the blood; and that they be kept in this &s;tate to continue the di&s;temper. Nothing is more known, than that there are plain &s;igns of great laxne&s;s in &s;ome ve&s;&s;els, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time, others are apparently too much braced; witne&s;s the &s;mall hard pul&s;e, and brown parched tongue in choleras and fevers with vo|mitings, purgings, profu&s;e &s;weats, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It will probably be admitted, that &s;ome degree of &s;pa&s;m, does, indeed, take place in time of the <HI>horror,</HI> but that this mu&s;t be removed, before a general warmth can return, more e&s;pecially ere the patient can &s;weat, or the urine become thick. But we are well a&s;&s;ured, that di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;pa&s;ms of particular parts oftentimes happen, and yet only a hardne&s;s, without much quickne&s;s, will be perceived in the pul&s;e, as is found in nervous and other colicks; the headaches, choakings, and &s;ome other complaints, common to hy&s;terical and hypochon|driacal people, in the biliary ducts during a jaundice, and even in the <HI>Tetanus</HI> it&s;elf, except during the general temporary contractions which are common to that cruel di&s;ea&s;e. So, in endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h the above theory, it was no where in&s;inuated, that the arteries mu&s;t be &s;o con&s;tricted, as wholly to prevent the fluids from pa&s;&s;ing; though this &s;eems nearly the ca&s;e &s;ometimes in tho&s;e of the extreme parts, during the &s;evere <HI>horrors</HI> of <HI>quartan and tertian intermittents.</HI> But that is a &s;tate of &s;uch violence, as no con&s;titutions can &s;upport for many hours together; and we accordingly find, that they who die of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, never recover a proper warmth after the <HI>horrors</HI> attacked; either a <HI>mortal anxiety, lethargy, convul&s;ions,</HI> or an <HI>apoplexy</HI> &s;oon

fevers, it hath been &s;aid, that the &s;pa&s;m needs not be very general to bring on and keep up tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es; for a per&s;on may be dangerou&s;ly ill, though only part of the &s;y&s;tem is thus affected; and even in the <HI>opi&s;thotonos</HI> it|&s;elf, &s;ome mu&s;cles commonly are capable of voluntary motions, whil&s;t others are detained in an unvaried &s;tate of violent contraction. Nothing farther can be inferred from tho&s;e &s;weats in fevers, than that the out|ward ve&s;&s;els are not &s;o &s;trongly con&s;tricted, as wholly to intercept the fluids from pa&s;&s;ing to the exhaling canals; or that the &s;pa&s;m was at &s;uch times &s;omewhat abated; the thick urine &s;howing the &s;ame of the &s;mall <HI>emulgent arteries.</HI> But, though tho&s;e unnatural contractions may abate in part, they cannot be &s;aid to have cea&s;ed, &s;o long as the pul&s;e is not &s;oft, be it &s;trong or weak, quick or &s;low, this hardne&s;s being a proof of too great &s;pringi|ne&s;s in the arteries.</P>
<P>Having offered &s;ome rea&s;ons, which, at lea&s;t, &s;eem to favour my opinion of the immediate cau&s;e of fevers, it may not be ami&s;s to point out a few of its mo&s;t obvious effects; and tho&s;e, with others not here mentioned, would be better under&s;tood, if the notion of &s;ome <HI>anatomi&s;ts</HI> were true, that the &s;everal different orders of ve&s;&s;els, con&s;i&s;t only of various arrangements of one and the &s;ame con|tinued canal, which is every where full of fluids. Nay farther, all the flexible parts of our bodies, are, al&s;o in|cluded in the above &s;uppo&s;al; of which were we a&s;&s;ured it might then be ea&s;y to account for the <HI>&s;ympathy,</HI> that evidently takes place between one part of our bodies and another.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="010575_0035_0F80D17DA52A6B68">Fir&s;t, We ob&s;erved, that from the time the &s;pa&s;m began, and whil&s;t it was gaining on the ve&s;&s;els, the equality of reciprocal action, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted before between them and the fluids, was interrupted, and health al&s;o declined in proportion to the force and extent of that contraction.</P>
<P>Secondly, As the blood was tumultuou&s;ly pu&s;hed for|wards in the viens at the time of the <HI>horror,</HI> becau&s;e of the &s;trong pre&s;&s;ure that was then made on them, by the con&s;triction of the &s;kin and other <HI>mu&s;cular membranes,</HI> the coats of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els being likewi&s;e rendered more &s;pringy thereby, it is plain, that the heart ought either to have admitted and expelled more blood in the &s;ame time than it does in health, or performed its motions quicker. But the former not being po&s;&s;ible, nor probable could it even receive &s;o much, becau&s;e its <HI>mu&s;cular fibres</HI> might be <HI>&s;pa&s;modically affected</HI> in &s;ome degree, the latter una|voidably happened.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Becau&s;e the capacities of all the arteries, on which this &s;pa&s;m acts (1.), mu&s;t be le&s;&s;ened in propor|tion, &s;o they can neither receive nor tran&s;mit their na|tural quantities of the fluids, &s;o long as they continue in that &s;tate: An overplus mu&s;t therefore be admitted by others, over and above what they ought to contain, were the circulation every where free. And the &s;tronger this check in any con&s;iderable number of ve&s;&s;els, the more mu&s;t the blood be collected, and the greater its impetus in tho&s;e that are more open and pa&s;&s;able, as being but little or not at all affected with the &s;pa&s;m; un|le&s;s where &s;uch overfulne&s;&s;es happen, as di&s;able the ar|teries from contracting them&s;elves properly.</P>

<P>Fifthly, Under circum&s;tances like tho&s;e (4.) the the ve&s;&s;els that are thus too much di&s;tended, cannot clear them&s;elves of this additional quantity of the blood, part|ly, becau&s;e they are &s;o &s;tretched thereby, that they have not the power to complete their <HI>&s;y&s;toles;</HI> but chiefly, for that the ve&s;&s;els in other parts, are not at pre&s;ent in con|dition to receive their full proportions of the fluids.</P>
<P>Sixthly, When things have come to that pa&s;s (5.), &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;pa&s;m &s;till gaining, and urging the fluids yet more into the internal and &s;uperiour parts, the pa|tients &s;trength being at the &s;ame time greatly &s;pent, the blood will then be compelled to retire within a narrow compa&s;s; and, at la&s;t, being mo&s;tly collected in the brain, lungs, and large ve&s;&s;els near the heart, the &s;mall arteries in the outward and extreme parts &s;hut them&s;elves up; the arms and legs lo&s;e their heat, and the mu&s;|culous

But here let us &s;top! for to tho&s;e who are much weakened, the la&s;t hour cannot now be far off. Nay, when the like &s;ymptoms happen to them, who enjoyed a good &s;hare of &s;trength but an hour be|fore, death mu&s;t &s;oon en&s;ue, if they cannot be &s;peedily relieved. They therefore who are cut off by acute di&s;|ea&s;es, may with truth be &s;aid to die a violent death; for the actions of tho&s;e organs on which life depends, are &s;topped and as it were overwhelmed by this exce&s;&s;ive ac|cumulation of the fluids in them, the ve&s;&s;els in other parts, being very generally clo&s;ed at &s;uch times; &s;o that the patients yield as <HI>victims</HI> to the vehemence of the &s;ymptoms, rather than becau&s;e their bodies are drained of the re&s;ources of life. For in tho&s;e di&s;tempers that prove mortal in a few days, enough of fluids often|times remains to the la&s;t ga&s;p to continue life, were the ve&s;&s;els but in condition to circulate them regularly. On the other hand, when any per&s;on &s;inks under a hemorr|hage, cholera, purging, &s;pitting, or other &s;udden or &s;low di&s;charges, the body is in the end &s;o deprived of its juices, that a &s;ufficiency of them is not left to fill the remote &s;mall ve&s;&s;els; which, for want of the u&s;ual re|&s;i&s;tance to their contractiblene&s;s, and becau&s;e the <HI>pro|jectile force</HI> of the heart is then very &s;mall, &s;hut them|&s;elves up to their axes.</P>

The &s;ame complaints have likewi&s;e been brought on tender &s;ubjects by a <HI>colick;</HI> for the con&s;trictions, that in this ca&s;e aro&s;e at fir&s;t in the &s;tomach, from the irritation of an <HI>acid acrimony,</HI> being communicated by &s;ympathy to the outward &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, a <HI>horror</HI> thence en&s;ued; and whenever that happens, be the cau&s;e what it will, more or le&s;s of fever mu&s;t en&s;ue; the di&s;ea&s;e, mo&s;t common|ly

being of that &s;ort which then prevails, no matter of whatever age or con&s;titution the patient may be. Ac|cordingly, we &s;ee the &s;tronge&s;t men have intermittents, or fevers of the depre&s;&s;ed kind in July and Augu&s;t; and on the other hand, puny per&s;ons and infants al&s;o, are liable to inflammatory di&s;orders in the winter.</P>
<P>I will further ob&s;erve, that acute di&s;tempers &s;eldom continue with the &s;ame violence and inten&s;ene&s;s of heat; for very commonly the patients have either &s;en&s;ible or ob&s;cure chilline&s;&s;es at times; and then it may be ju&s;tly concluded, that the &s;pa&s;m is &s;till gaining and the di&s;ea&s;e increa&s;ing in con&s;equence. At the time of tho&s;e chilli|ne&s;&s;es, the pul&s;e is more quick, hard and &s;mall, and all the former &s;ymptoms are heightened; for &s;uch &s;hiver|ings truly are <HI>horrors,</HI> which not only aggravate the <HI>&s;pa&s;m</HI> that acted before, but make it extend to a greater number of ve&s;&s;els, whereby the di&s;order will at lea&s;t be prolonged. Such occa&s;ional &s;hiverings &s;hould therefore be prevented if po&s;&s;ible, by keeping the patients pro|perly covered, according to the weather, for every time the cold air hath acce&s;s to their bodies, tho&s;e <HI>horrors</HI> will more certainly come on, e&s;pecially in the winter.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the cure of common, continued, and inflammatory fevers.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE for a long time thought, that, among the variety of di&s;tempers to which we are liable, <HI>fevers,</HI> in particular, have been divided in too many cla&s;&s;es; nor are the ways of treating them le&s;s diver&s;ified. It might have been meant by this &s;hew of exactne&s;s, to leave us as little room as po&s;&s;ible, to mi&s;take one di&s;ea&s;e for another; but, in my opinion, that end had been better an&s;wered by fewer principles, &s;o they were well defined. For experience hath convinced me, that it matters not much, under what forms &s;everal acute di&s;or|ders appear, or whatever may be the ages or con&s;titutions of the patients (when no particular acrimony prevails), provided the complaints agree in &s;ome circum&s;tances with others, that are commonly believed to be of very different natures; and for no rea&s;on that I can perceive, but becau&s;e &s;ome &s;ymptoms fall more on one part than another. Hence the di&s;ea&s;e hath &s;ome name, which &s;uits well enough in conver&s;ation; but it &s;hould not be thence inferred, that any material difference ought always to be made in the manner of curing it, more e&s;pecially at its fir&s;t on&s;et. For if it be granted, that a <HI>&s;pa&s;modick contraction of the arteries is the immediate cau&s;e of fevers,</HI> and that the &s;ymptoms which happen in the cour&s;es of tho&s;e di&s;tempers, are owing as it were to an inverted or irregular circulation of the blood, what hath
<PB N="42" REF="010575_0043_0F80D186C7B1E110">
ju&s;t now been &s;aid, will not appear &s;o chimerical; more e&s;pecially when it is applied to &s;uch feveri&s;h complaints as attack tho&s;e, who but a few hours before were in health.</P>
<P>It would be needle&s;s, to give many in&s;tances of a me|thod I have for many years u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s, to remove common continued, or inflammatory fevers, within the fir&s;t or &s;econd day, when they were not attended with a purging, which happens but &s;eldom in the latter &s;ort. But for an example, let us &s;uppo&s;e a &s;trong man to be attacked with <HI>a pleuri&s;y;</HI> yet, though this be as dange|rous and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing a malady, as almo&s;t any we are liable to, it will be removed in a few hours by purging and &s;weating, &s;o the di&s;charges be but plentiful, and the pa|tient is properly taken care of. Nor will the rea&s;on, why this management &s;hould have &s;o good effects, be a &s;ecret to tho&s;e, who recollect what hath been &s;aid on the con&s;trictions of the external ve&s;&s;els, and the overfulne&s;&s;es they occa&s;ion within; which being only effects of the former, are more directly abated by purging, than any other evacuation that can be made; and therefore, whatever inflammation or ob&s;truction might have en&s;ued from the pre&s;ent di&s;tended condition of the internal ve&s;|&s;els, will be prevented by tho&s;e means. For great re|peated <HI>revul&s;ions</HI> being thus made, as it were immediately from tho&s;e parts, they will be relieved in proportion, of the overcharges they &s;u&s;tained, by every loo&s;e &s;tool. And as the like effects extend to all tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, in which any degree of <HI>plethora</HI> took place, and even to the heart and lungs, each mu&s;t then act with more power, &s;o as not only to clear them&s;elves of whatever

plenitude might &s;till remain in them, but al&s;o by com|municating a bri&s;ker impul&s;e to the blood it&s;elf the &s;mall contracted arteries will thereby be dilated by de|grees. Farther to in&s;ure the patient's &s;weating, hot bricks ought to be laid at a convenient di&s;tance from the feet and legs, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in taking off the unnatural contrac|tions, that we &s;uppo&s;ed were &s;tronge&s;t thereabouts, by the kindly warmth they give tho&s;e parts. The effect of this treatment is &s;uch, that, after the per&s;on hath had &s;ome large &s;tools, and &s;weated plentifully at the &s;ame time, the pul&s;e, which began to &s;often and fill, on the &s;ecretions being freely promoted in the <HI>abdominal vi&s;cera,</HI> will &s;oon become &s;low and natural, as a proof that the &s;pa&s;m is removed, and the blood circulated regularly; all that was required for the cure.</P>
<P>This is my common way of rea&s;oning, on the good effects of purging and &s;weating, in the early &s;tages of fevers, but whether I judge rightly or not, the advan|tages of &s;uch treatment, have been confirmed to me by thou&s;ands of in&s;tances. To be diligent in ob&s;erving, what the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e con&s;tantly requires to remove it, in the mo&s;t &s;peedy and effectual manner, and perfect our judgments therein, with all the certainty that experience and the nature of things will allow, is, in my opinion, the only true way, to e&s;tabli&s;h a rational theory and &s;ucce&s;s|ful practice; as both would then depend on &s;uch fixed principles as mu&s;t abide the te&s;t. Whether I have &s;uc|ceeded either way, is left to others; but this I may be allowed, that the above theory &s;eems to ju&s;tify the prac|tice as this does the former. For, pa&s;t all doubts, had not the ve&s;&s;els within been too much filled, to increa&s;e
<PB N="44" REF="010575_0045_0F80D188AA12CC38">
the excretions directly from them, and promote &s;o many plentiful &s;tools, mu&s;t have had con&s;equences of the mo&s;t dangerous nature; and, on the other hand, had not the outward parts been too much braced or con|&s;tricted, then, &s;urely, to bring on profu&s;e &s;weats by relaxing them &s;till more, had been equally pernicious.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t began to u&s;e this method, &s;ome di&s;appoint|ments happened, from my not attending to that material circum&s;tance of rai&s;ing and keeping up a proper heat in the legs and feet, and guarding the other parts of the body from cold air, more e&s;pecially during the winter; the nece&s;&s;ity for which did not then occur, though it was altogether con&s;i&s;tent with the notion of a <HI>&s;pa&s;modick con|&s;triction:</HI> But, after care was taken that way, few patients mi&s;&s;ed of relief, unle&s;s they them&s;elves or their attend|ants, thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to comply with &s;uch &s;eem|ingly tri&s;ling injunctions.</P>
<P>That the patients may not be obliged to get up, a warm bed-pan mu&s;t always be carefully conveyed to them under the bed-clothes; and their drink and nouri&s;h|ment &s;hould be given either with a child's feeding-boat, or through the &s;pout of a tea-pot, as they lie covered; be&s;ides, when the bricks cool, tho&s;e &s;hould be removed and hot ones put in their places, &s;o long as may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Though the fever, together with the painful &s;ymptoms, will undoubtedly be abated by tho&s;e means, yet they may not cea&s;e on this fir&s;t trial. In that ca&s;e, the medicine mu&s;t be repeated, and the di&s;charges pro|moted more bri&s;kly, unle&s;s the patient be already very weak; but he mu&s;t be &s;o, in an extreme degree, to deter
<PB N="45" REF="010575_0046_0F80D189226ED1C0">
us from attempting his relief at once by purging and &s;weating, rather than &s;uffer an expectoration to come on in a <HI>pleuri&s;y or peripneumony;</HI> for at be&s;t, <HI>that</HI> gives only a chance to recover.</P>
<P>I ought to ob&s;erve, that it is not always nece&s;&s;ary to re|peat the laxative, though the &s;ymptoms be not wholly removed, &s;o the mo&s;t accute are abated; for it may then be &s;ufficient, to make a decoction of poppy-heads and anni&s;eeds with water; and when the liquor is pre&s;&s;|ed out, &s;ome e&s;&s;ence of antimony and a little &s;ugar being added, one common &s;poonful of this mixture mu&s;t be given every half hour, or &s;eldomer, according to the ca&s;e, till the patient &s;weats freely, and the fever and pain cea&s;e. A dry tickling cough is &s;ometimes trouble|&s;ome for a few days after, the di&s;ea&s;e is pretty well over; to allay which, I add the in&s;pi&s;&s;ated juice of liquorice to the decoction of poppies, and a little of the be&s;t olive-oil di&s;&s;olved with extract of gum arabick, is afterward mixed with the liquor, to be given as above.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the earlier this method is pur&s;ued, &s;o much the better will it &s;ucceed; for if the breathing had been much ob&s;tructed for &s;ome days, by a &s;evere pain in the &s;ide or brea&s;t, this, together with the &s;pa&s;m which then acts on the outward ve&s;&s;els, will cau&s;e the fluids to accummulate in the lungs; hence a dry cough mu&s;t en&s;ue from anxiety, at the beginning of tho&s;e com|plaints; but the &s;ecretions in that part being afterwards increa&s;ed by degrees, the phlegm that then lies extra|va&s;ated in the <HI>bronchial ve&s;icles,</HI> will al&s;o excite a cough, by its irritation, to expel it&s;elf; and thus both the cough
<PB N="46" REF="010575_0047_0F80D189C2984A98">
and &s;pitting mu&s;t continue till the overfulne&s;&s;es that took place in the <HI>pulmonary</HI> ve&s;&s;els be removed, and the pro|fu&s;e &s;ecretions there cea&s;e in con&s;equence. But tho&s;e things would not have happened, had the complaint been abated within the fir&s;t or &s;econd day; at lea&s;t they could not be either dangerous or trouble&s;ome; and, in general, the &s;ame treatment an&s;wers very well at any time before the expectoration becomes free.</P>
<P>The patient's chamber ought not to be too clo&s;e or warm, nor his bed &s;tand very near a fire, that the air he breathes may not be hot and dry. His head and brea&s;t mu&s;t be rai&s;ed high; and though he &s;hould be carefully covered, the bed-clothes need not be more than he u&s;ed in health, except from the wai&s;t downwards, for the &s;weat we would bring on, will be &s;ufficiently pro|moted by the hot bricks, and warm drink and nouri&s;h|ment, which &s;hould be given often, but in &s;mall quan|tities. For tho&s;e purpo&s;es, weak &s;age tea &s;weetened a little with honey, meager broth made with lean meat of any &s;ort, and thin &s;trained gruel, will &s;erve in lieu of every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>This hint for purging, I borrowed from <HI>nature;</HI> for ob&s;erving when inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es were mo&s;t com|mon, that tho&s;e patients who had loo&s;ene&s;&s;es at the be|ginning of fevers, &s;eldom were liable to complaints of the &s;ides, brea&s;t or parts above; and al&s;o, that the di&s;|tempers were generally mild and &s;hort, even in the win|ter; or, if a <HI>pleuri&s;y, peripneumony</HI> or <HI>quin&s;y</HI> came on during the pre&s;ent illne&s;s, this did not happen till the purging cea&s;ed; and likewi&s;e, that if the belly be|came
<PB N="47" REF="010575_0048_0F80D18A5E792D90">
freely loo&s;e, on the fir&s;t days of pleuri&s;ies or pe|ripneumonies, they commonly were abated thereby: It, therefore, &s;eemed rea&s;onable, that a <HI>diarrhea,</HI> promoted by art, would have good effects in &s;uch ca&s;es; which ac|cordingly fell out, and with greater advantages than were expected; but, to confe&s;s a truth, at my fir&s;t &s;etting out in this way, I underwent &s;ome &s;erious reflections, on &s;traying &s;o much from the common forms of practi&s;ing. Repeated purging is recommended in inflammatory <HI>quin&s;ies;</HI> but why &s;o carefully forbidden in the fir&s;t days of <HI>pleuri&s;ies</HI> and <HI>peripneumonies,</HI> I &s;ee no rea&s;on. If this caution proceeded from fear, either to delay or prevent the expectoration that of cour&s;e is expected in tho&s;e di&s;orders, one with equal probability would apprehend the &s;ame, from the large repeated bleedings that are generally made.</P>
<P>What <HI>Boerhaave</HI> &s;ays in his 830th and 888th A|phori&s;m, is remarkably to the point; for &s;peaking of a peripneumony and pleuri&s;y, he tells us, <HI>'that a great di&s;|charge of bile by &s;tool,'</HI> is one of the ways in which a <HI>cri&s;is</HI> happens in tho&s;e di&s;orders; and his re&s;erve <HI>'if the pa|tient be relieved thereby,'</HI> is as applicable to the other <HI>con|coctions and excretions,</HI> by which he &s;ays tho&s;e di&s;tempers are removed before the 4th day. How a &s;uitable in|crea&s;e of the <HI>abdominal &s;ecretions,</HI> may relieve the ve&s;&s;els in the <HI>thorax</HI> of their pre&s;ent overfulne&s;&s;es, and thereby prevent an ob&s;truction, which might end in an inflam|mation, I ea&s;ily perceive, but cannot &s;o readily compre|hend the meaning of the word <HI>concoction,</HI> &s;o commonly u&s;ed in &s;peaking of fevers, without any erruption or ten|dency
<PB N="48" REF="010575_0049_0F80D18D957EBB38">
to a &s;uppuration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By <HI>concoction,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e authours mean &s;uch a change wrought on the <HI>mor|bifick cau&s;e,</HI> as renders it either inactive and inert, or prepares it for being expel|led the body by &s;ome outlet. But in &s;imple continued, inflammatory, or other common fevers, to &s;peak of <HI>morbifick mat|ter</HI> and <HI>concoction,</HI> is more likely to lead us into a labyrinth, than &s;atisfy our judge|ments, more e&s;pecially at the beginning of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, when they attack them, who ju&s;t before were in health. Indeed it is quite rea&s;onable, to apply tho&s;e terms to <HI>contagious di&s;orders,</HI> and al&s;o to fevers that ari&s;e from inflammations tending to &s;uppuration, for there a <HI>morbifick matter</HI> is evident; but I have known the great|e&s;t part of a large company &s;icken in the &s;pring or autumn, after &s;pending &s;everal days together, on a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">arty of plea&s;ure as it was called. Yet though they all were alike expo&s;ed to the &s;ame weather by day as well as in the night, and partook of the &s;ame intemperate exerci&s;es and irre|gularities, one per&s;on however was pre|&s;ently after confined by the gout or rheu|mati&s;m; another had the quin&s;y; a third a dy&s;entery, ague, purging, tooth-ach, and &s;o on. Here then it is plain, that the &s;ame general remote cau&s;es acted equally on them all; but it is no le&s;s true, they had as various effects on their different con&s;titutions; yet according to the common mode of &s;peaking, each com|plaint here had a <HI>morbifick cau&s;e</HI> proper to it&s;elf, the nature of which let tho&s;e ex|plain, who, on all occa&s;ions, adopt &s;uch rea&s;oning, We &s;ay with propriety, that the eruption, when complete and benign, is a cri&s;is to the fir&s;t fever in the mea&s;les and &s;mall pox; whereas in &s;ome other acute di&s;orders, there are certain <HI>exanthe|matous</HI> appearances, which never fail to portend death to the patients. Can any thinking man a&s;&s;ert, that in pleuri&s;ies, peripneumonies, catarrhal fevers, or pi|tuitous a&s;thmas, the body is really di&s;|charged of the morbifick matter by &s;pit|ting, which only empties the ve&s;&s;els that were over charged? or when a fever, quin&s;y, tooth-ach, head-ach, or even the di&s;tempers ju&s;t now mentioned, are re|moved by purging and &s;weating dextrou&s;ly u&s;ed at their beginnings, that this hap|pened by our thus expelling their <HI>morbifick cau&s;es;</HI> or when the con&s;titution is much relaxed, both as to the &s;olids and fluids, by an intermitting fever; can it be &s;aid, that the bark (which cures merely by its bracing qualities, without promoting any one &s;en&s;ible excretion) then acts by ex|pelling a <HI>morbifick matter</HI> of any &s;ort? I would be under&s;tood, that no di&s;tempe|rature exi&s;ted in the fluids, preceding the attacks of &s;imple acute di&s;ea&s;es, on tho&s;e who ju&s;t before were in health; though it cannot be denied that fevers may bring on &s;omewhat of this &s;ort, and then it is to be e&s;teemed an effect rather that the cau&s;e of the di&s;order, notwith&s;tanding to may require our attention to remove it.</NOTE>. Farther, if purging be di&s;ap|proved at the beginning of the fevers we &s;peak of, be|cau&s;e a plentiful <HI>diarrhea</HI> le&s;&s;ens and even &s;tops the &s;pit|tings in the &s;econd &s;tages of them, the effect complained of, is a direct proof of the advantages of bri&s;k purging, at the time we recommend. For nothing &s;hews more clearly, how &s;udden and great a revul&s;ion is thereby made from the parts affected, by the humours being &s;o
<PB N="49" REF="010575_0050_0F80D18E52CEF100">
ha&s;tily carried off another way; whereas, when tho&s;e complaints are thus far advanced, &s;uch a wa&s;te of the fluids &s;hould by no means be made; for they ought rather to be detained then, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in di&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ing or di&s;|&s;olving whatever ob&s;truction or inflammation hath hap|pened in the lungs or el&s;ewhere.

<P>I follow the &s;ame method at the beginning of every common fever, when the belly is not already loo&s;e enough; for at &s;uch times, it is by no means &s;ufficient, that the patients have &s;tools as in health (which yet hap|pens but &s;eldom in the fir&s;t days of inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es), becau&s;e, however well this might &s;uit, when all the <HI>na|tural di&s;charges</HI> proceed in due order and proportion, &s;omething more will be nece&s;&s;ary, now, that this harmo|ny is broken in upon. Nor will cly&s;ters fulfill the in|tention, as much experience hath convinced me; not to mention, that, according to the foregoing theory, there are good rea&s;ons again&s;t the u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>The advantages of removing all fevers &s;peedily, and in particular tho&s;e of the &s;ides and lungs, are too many and great to need many words. And it is needle&s;s to &s;how, how preferable the above method is, to the com|mon way of bleeding the patients not only largely at once, but al&s;o repeatedly, which yet often fails to re|move
<PB N="50" REF="010575_0051_0F80D18EE9428FA0">
tho&s;e complaints, probably, becau&s;e &s;ome rules above laid down, are not ob&s;erved, I mean, as to pro|moting &s;weats after &s;uch evacuations; for, let the pa|tients lo&s;e ever &s;o much blood, enough of that fluid will &s;till remain to renew the pain, &s;o the &s;pa&s;m of the arte|ries be permitted to continue. Nay, it may even be|come &s;tronger, and communicate it&s;elf to a greater number of ve&s;&s;els, the more the fluids are dimini&s;hed, unle&s;s care be taken to prevent this; for the latter being the only antagoni&s;ts, to the &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition the arteries have to contraction, when this is not properly re&s;i&s;ted, they will clo&s;e them&s;elves in proportion. Granting, however, the di&s;ea&s;e to be cured by a great lo&s;s of blood, this happens preci&s;ely by emptying the ve&s;&s;els, though in a le&s;s direct manner than we propo&s;e, con|&s;idering the nature and &s;eat of the complaint, but with this difference, that it weakens the patient much more than purging and &s;weating. Suppo&s;ing after all, that the di&s;temper is not removed by bleeding, weakened as the patient already is, his recovery will then depend on ex|pectoration alone, which mu&s;t not only be plentiful, but of a good quality al&s;o. A dangerous condition &s;urely! for however well &s;uited this di&s;charge may be, we have too many fatal in&s;tances to prove, that it may be ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by various accidents; be&s;ides many ill con|&s;equence oftentimes en&s;ue, from this manner of termi|nating tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. For tho&s;e rea&s;ons, an expectora|tion &s;hould not be &s;uffered to come on at all, if by any means they can be cured without it. But it is worthy of remark, that when recovery is effected even that way, it is really compleated at la&s;t, in the manner we propo&s;e at fir&s;t, by emptying the internal ve&s;&s;els at once,

which is gradually done by the &s;pitting; but with much more hazard to the patient. One the whole, be the &s;e|verity of tho&s;e di&s;tempers abated by whatever means, a &s;weat will neverthele&s;s come on &s;ooner or latter; when, and not before, the pul&s;e becomes &s;low and natural, in evidence that the &s;pa&s;modick con&s;trictions of the arteries are then removed, as already hath been &s;aid.</P>
<P>In &s;ome countries, bleeding may perhaps be more nece&s;&s;ary in inflammatory fevers, than I have generally found it in <HI>South-Carolina;</HI> yet, be this operation &s;o needful or not here, it is no where more practi&s;ed. Tho&s;e who are of opinion, that they ought not to de|part from a rule, which hath &s;o long been as it were univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed, may order &s;ome blood to be taken away if they plea&s;e, &s;o the patient be &s;trong; but I &s;eldom do, unle&s;s the di&s;order had been of &s;ome days continuance, or the pain in the &s;ide &s;o acute, to ob&s;truct breathing greatly, and thus occa&s;ion the fluids to accumulate in a high degree in the lungs, be|cau&s;e, for the mo&s;t part, much bleeding weakens the &s;ick rather than gives la&s;ting relief. For though the pain abates &s;ometimes, during the flow of blood from the vein, and may be ea&s;ier for a &s;mall time after, it will &s;urely return, &s;o the &s;pa&s;m continues, when every thing remains &s;till to be done, as if no blood had been lo&s;t. I therefore depend on purging and &s;weating, being mo|rally certain of &s;ucce&s;s that way, provided the di&s;char|ges be plentiful, and things are properly conducted in other re&s;pects.</P>

And as the ve&s;&s;els there &s;hut them&s;elves up &s;till more, this gains on the limbs in proportion, &s;o that they become cold and &s;ometimes livid, the circulation being then at an end in tho&s;e parts. And thus the progre&s;s of death on the body may be traced; the extreme parts being in|&s;en&s;ible and inanimated, for many hours, perhaps, be|fore life is extingui&s;hed in the brain and near the heart. On the other hand, the death of tho&s;e is more &s;udden, in whom a &s;trong <HI>horror</HI> or <HI>rigor</HI> happened, becau&s;e of the general and violent contractions of the ve&s;&s;els, which repel the blood tumultuou&s;ly, and as it were at once, in|to the internal and &s;uperiour parts.

the contrary, &s;ome cannot lie &s;till at all, but to&s;s them|&s;elves about in the mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s manner, &s;o long as they are able, from the dreadful &s;tifling, which is cau&s;ed by the fluids being exce&s;&s;ively accumulated in the lungs and large ve&s;&s;els near the heart: Breathing is then very &s;hort, redoubled and <HI>&s;u&s;pirious;</HI> and the patient perceives an intolerable heat about the brea&s;t, which &s;eems to diffu&s;e it&s;elf all over his body, &s;o that he will not endure any covering, and calls out to be fanned, and to have every window &s;et open, be the weather ever &s;o rigorous, though at the &s;ame time, he is bathed with clammy &s;weats, and his legs and arms are cold as marble. The anxious re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s we ju&s;t now mentioned, was &s;aid to continue &s;o long as the patient could move, or, as would &s;eem, till the ve&s;&s;els of the brain became &s;o di&s;tended and full, that they compre&s;s the origins of the nerves, and then an end is at once put to all further &s;en&s;ations. The brain being thus effectually &s;urcharged, and the blood &s;till continuing to be propelled that way, the like overfulne&s;&s;es begin in the ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>cerebellum;</HI> and from that in&s;tant of time, breathing, which before was exceeding &s;hort, becomes very &s;low; and the per&s;on moves no more, but dies in the po&s;ture he lay when that happened. In&s;piration is every moment performed at longer intervals now, and cea&s;es as the la&s;t act of life, when tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els are &s;tretched and filled, beyond the power of exerting any farther contractions.

For before that &s;ort of breathing happened, &s;uch an overfulne&s;s mu&s;t have been in the ve&s;&s;els of the brain, that they could receive no more; the whole of the fluids being at tho&s;e times confined to few ve&s;&s;els.</P>

<P>I &s;hall end this e&s;&s;ay with &s;ome queries, which, in my opinion, cannot be &s;o well explained in any other way, as by &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>&s;pa&s;modical con&s;trictions we mentioned, to be the immediate cau&s;e of fevers,</HI> owing, probably, to &s;ome &s;ort of <HI>irritation</HI> affecting the nerves in their cour&s;es towards, or after they are in&s;erted in the blood ve&s;&s;els and other mu&s;cular membranes. And it is not unlikely, When a per&s;on hath been injured by cold or moi&s;t air, or a high wind acting on the lungs and outer &s;urface of the body, that they produce the &s;ame effects by &s;timu|lating too much, as a &s;harp humour is known to do, whil&s;t it lies in the bowels or pa&s;&s;es thence to the blood.</P>
<P>Q. Whether an abatement of the per&s;piration, be of it&s;elf &s;o certain and common a cau&s;e of fevers, as is thought, &s;eeing the mo&s;t dangerous often times attack tho&s;e &s;uddenly; who were in health but an hour or two before; &s;o that, neither the quantity nor quality of that humour which might then be detained, can, with rea&s;on, be accu&s;ed of &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ing effects in &s;o &s;mall a time?</P>
<P>Whether, before a fever can come on, the fluids mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have contracted &s;ome &s;ort of acrimony or vi&s;cidne&s;s, and of cour&s;e, that the &s;olids were either too much braced or relaxed? I would be under&s;tood, that according to the common way of &s;peaking, one or the other of tho&s;e conditions mu&s;t have exi&s;ted, before the <HI>morbifick cau&s;e</HI> began to act; or that tho&s;e of them&s;elves
<PB N="61" REF="010575_0062_0F80D19A75B494B8">
were &s;ufficient to produce tho&s;e effects? but tho&s;e two que&s;tions have been already an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Why, in general, the more &s;evere the <HI>horror</HI> and longer its continuance, &s;o much the more dangerous is the &s;uc|ceeding di&s;ea&s;e? At fir&s;t &s;ight one would expect, that the &s;tronger the <HI>rigor,</HI> the more powerful mu&s;t be the cau&s;e that brought it on, and therefore, the greater would be the difficulty to remove the di&s;order that follows. Yet, though this rule mo&s;t commonly holds, we have an exception to it in the violent &s;hiverings, which &s;ome|times precede tertian and quartan intermittents, the fits, in either ca&s;e, often terminating in five or &s;ix hours; perhaps, becau&s;e the &s;olids are lax rather than very &s;pringy, and the blood not very compact, before tho&s;e &s;orts of fevers can be formed at all; and therefore, the fibres relax &s;ooner after a good warmth is regained; the plentiful &s;weat which follows putting an end to the fever for that time.</P>
<P>What is the rea&s;on why tho&s;e who commonly have cold feet, are in a particular manner liable to di&s;orders of the <HI>hypoga&s;trium</HI> and parts above? This want of heat mu&s;t be owing to a lurking <HI>&s;pa&s;m</HI> acting on the ve&s;&s;els there, which prevents the free motion of the blood; &s;o much of it therefore as cannot circulate freely in tho&s;e parts, mu&s;t be received by others, over and above what they ought to contain, if a regular di&s;tribution of the fluids took place. This &s;urplus will be admitted where|ever any local weakne&s;&s;es happen, &s;o that the effects are extremely various. I never knew any per&s;on who was habitually liable to &s;uch a coldne&s;s of the legs and feet,

in whom an acid acrimony did not abound, at lea&s;t in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, which by its irritation there, or hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed thence to the blood, may indeed be the cau&s;e of the partial &s;pa&s;m we &s;peak of.</P>
<P>Why are vomitings and purgings &s;o common in fe|vers during the &s;ummer and autumn, and <HI>choleras,</HI> &s;e|rous or bilious diarrheas al&s;o &s;hould then be frequent? Becau&s;e the &s;olids are very lax at tho&s;e times, and the blood much di&s;&s;olved. The former therefore are ex|ceedingly irritable and &s;u&s;ceptible of <HI>&s;pa&s;ms</HI> from &s;light cau&s;es; and, &s;eeing every unnatural con&s;triction of the outward parts, repels the fluids in &s;ome degree, they will now be immediately admitted by the ve&s;&s;els within; in which overfulne&s;&s;es en&s;uing, their contents will be as readily allowed to e&s;cape, by an increa&s;e of &s;ome &s;ecre|tion or other. The quantity of returning blood through the <HI>vena portarum</HI> to the liver, being augmented by a <HI>&s;pa&s;m,</HI> a profu&s;e &s;eparation of the bile follows; which, pa&s;&s;ing into the <HI>duodenum,</HI> occa&s;ions vomitings, purg|ings, or both; for the gall is of &s;o pungent and &s;apona|ceous a nature, that it will &s;timulate the &s;tomach and guts &s;trongly to expel it&s;elf; and tho&s;e di&s;charges will continue till the &s;pa&s;m cea&s;es.

But on the fifth day the &s;ymptoms were &s;o violent, that the patient's life was in a manner de&s;pair|ed of. His feet being put in warm water, a vein was opened in each, with a large orifice, but no blood i&s;&s;ued, &s;o cold were tho&s;e parts. Scalding water, as would &s;eem, was then poured on them, which made the veins bleed freely, and with &s;o good effect, that the half dead patient was not only relieved, but recovered.&mdash; Vide <HI>Van Savieten comment, in Boerhaave</HI> Aph.

<P>This <HI>noble and excellent phy&s;ician</HI> &s;peak|ing here of the advantages of bleeding in a <HI>pleuri&s;y,</HI> imputes the recovery of this patient to the quantity of blood that was then taken away; though the two former large bleedings, did not prevent his growing wor&s;e.

<P>Thus have I given my opinion on this &s;ubject, which if founded in rea&s;on, did not need the ornaments of eloquence, to recommend it to the ingenuous.

<P>The arteries are naturally &s;o di&s;po&s;ed to contraction, from the &s;trength of their <HI>orbicular fibres,</HI> that were it not for the re&s;i&s;tance made by our fluids, they would &s;hut them&s;elves up to their axes.

In this ca&s;e, the feet and hands become cold, and the countenance pale and con|tracted; all the outward parts &s;hrink; and clammy &s;weats appear as the arteries collap&s;e, for want of a &s;uitable quantity and due <HI>impul&s;e</HI> in the blood, to keep them fully di&s;tended; &s;o that the &s;kin, together with its contiguous ve&s;&s;els and membranes, plainly undergoes <HI>&s;pa&s;modical con|&s;trictions</HI> at &s;uch times.</P>

<P>Repeated bleeding is al&s;o enjoined in &s;ome ca&s;es, till the blood appears florid and free of all <HI>&s;izine&s;s;</HI> but whatever &s;how of rea&s;on may be in this, the injunction &s;eems not much better founded, than the common ex|pre&s;&s;ion <HI>of taking away all the bad blood, and leaving only what is good behind.</HI> For it may be truly a&s;&s;erted, that this point will not be attained, &s;o the fever continues, before the ve&s;&s;els have been too much emptied, and the vital actions depre&s;&s;ed in proportion.</P>

All the bad effects of this headlong &s;ort of practice, cannot be recounted here; but let us give a very common in&s;tance, in the ca&s;es of tho&s;e who are &s;tupid and drow&s;y in fevers, from too great a fulne&s;s in the ve&s;&s;els of the brain, the belly being at the &s;ame time bound.&mdash;Now, though the fevers may abate, according to the u&s;ual cour&s;es of tho&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es, yet a hard and too quick pul&s;e, head-ach, &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, and general di&s;order, frequently remain, as evidences, not only of a lurking <HI>&s;pa&s;m,</HI> but likewi&s;e of too great an overcharge &s;till remaining, in the in|ternal and &s;uperiour ve&s;&s;els. To give an emetick, there|fore, under circum&s;tances like the&s;e, can &s;carcely fail in having pernicious effects; even <HI>convul&s;ions,</HI> a <HI>dilirium</HI> or <HI>&s;tupor</HI> &s;ometimes en&s;uing immediately, or at the next re|turn or increa&s;e of the fever. How tho&s;e things &s;hould be, is &s;o evident as not to need any explanation: Never|thele&s;s when a patient di&s;charges much <HI>mucus, acidity, green or yellow bile,</HI> in the fever, we ought to promote the vomitings with warm water drank plentifully, and thrown up again, till it returns clear and ta&s;tele&s;s. <HI>Car|duus or camomile tea</HI> is often u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, from a notion that they &s;trengthen the &s;tomach; but they lie &s;o little a while there, that any effect they may have this way, does not de&s;erve our regard at &s;uch times; be&s;ides, the bitterne&s;s of tho&s;e infu&s;ions conceals other ta&s;tes, &s;o that we cannot &s;o well know when all the offending mat|ter is di&s;charged, as if water alone were u&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ESSAY II.</HI> Of the Cri&s;es of Common Continued, and Inflamma|tory Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>IT will plainly appear from the foregoing <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> how ill qualified the authour is for <HI>medical di&s;putation,</HI> more e&s;pecially, when the de&s;ign was to oppo&s;e &s;ome notions, that have been long admitted for truths. But if there be rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that certain opinions have been adopted, which were liable to objection, it can have no bad con&s;equences to examine them, &s;eeing tho&s;e things will &s;till remain as before, if they be not di&s;|proved.</P>
<P>Various are the ways in which <HI>cri&s;es</HI> are &s;aid to be brought about; but however the &s;ymptoms might be moderated in fevers by a hemorrhage, or an increa&s;e of &s;ome excretion or other, I never &s;aw an acute di&s;ea&s;e go clearly off, before a general &s;weat happened. This &s;ort of per&s;piration, &s;ometimes, is of &s;o rank a nature, as to be offen&s;ive to the &s;ick them&s;elves, and their attendants
<PB N="78" REF="010575_0078_0F80D1AA059492D8">
al&s;o, owing, perhaps, to the great heat and rapid mo|tion the fluids &s;u&s;tained, whereby their &s;aline and &s;ul|phureous parts were not only multiplied, but rendered more volatile al&s;o; the urine and &s;tools, likewi&s;e, ac|quiring a more nau&s;eous &s;cent from the &s;ame cau&s;es.</P>
<P>When this &s;weat is coming on, the pul&s;e becomes fuller and more &s;oft, and the tongue moi&s;ter, as &s;igns of &s;ome abatement in the <HI>&s;pa&s;modick</HI> condition of the &s;olids, and that the hindrance to a more regular di&s;tribution of the fluids, is now giving way. And, as the per&s;pira|tion advances more, the pul&s;e &s;till &s;oftens, fills and be|comes &s;lower; whatever overfulne&s;&s;es happened in the internal and &s;uperiour parts, together with the &s;everal &s;ymptoms which depended thereon, abating al&s;o by de|grees. For as the outward ve&s;&s;els relax yet more, and continue to di&s;charge them&s;elves plentifully, tho&s;e with|in, being ea&s;ed of their overload, by the humours now taking another cour&s;e, recover their <HI>&s;y&s;tole,</HI> and by little and little clear them&s;elves of the &s;urcharges they &s;uffer|ed; &s;o that, provided things be but well managed now, a free circulation will &s;oon en&s;ue; or, in other words, the di&s;ea&s;e will cea&s;e, all the unnatural con&s;trictions being then abated.</P>
<P>Before the pul&s;e becomes &s;ofter and more full, it will be vain to look for the <HI>&s;edimentum album leve &amp; aequale,</HI> &s;o much wi&s;hed for in the urine during an acute di&s;ea&s;e; becau&s;e the <HI>morbifick matter</HI> is thought to be di&s;charged that way. But this &s;ort of &s;ediment, among others, is only a &s;ign, that the ve&s;&s;els within are recovering their natural diameters, whether they had been too much di|lated
<PB N="79" REF="010575_0079_0F80D1AA9F5BB1D8">
or contracted before; for more or le&s;s of &s;uch a &s;ettling, will always be &s;een in the urine of people in health: And why it &s;hould be more plentiful at the end of fevers, may be under&s;tood from the greater laxne&s;s of the &s;olids, and di&s;&s;olution of the fluids, of which both the full &s;oft pul&s;e and <HI>critical &s;weat</HI> are proofs. Be|&s;ides, from the vehemence of the circulation during a fever, more particles may be rubbed off the coats of the ve&s;&s;els than in health, and help to increa&s;e this &s;edi|ment. Here I would be under&s;tood to mean, what hap|pens at the termination of acute di&s;ea&s;es; for though the blood be ever &s;o <HI>&s;izy,</HI> when the compre&s;&s;ing force of the ve&s;&s;els was exerted with its greate&s;t power, yet, if the patient be bled &s;ome hours after the fever cea&s;ed, the <HI>&s;erum</HI> will then be more in quantity than it was during the di&s;temper, and the red part le&s;s. Indeed, the palene&s;s and weakne&s;s which are &s;een after every fever, plainly enough &s;how, that the &s;olids are much relaxed and the blood thinned.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be inferred from tho&s;e loo&s;e hints, that I con&s;ider the in&s;pection of the urine as unnece&s;&s;ary; on the contrary, I do not know any one of the internal &s;ecre|tions, whence &s;o good a judgment may be formed, of the condition of the parts within during fevers, as from <HI>that di&s;charge.</HI> The urine is clear in acute di&s;ea&s;es with <HI>convul&s;ions, &s;tupors,</HI> or <HI>delirium,</HI> more e&s;pecially if the latter be of the outrageous &s;ort; in <HI>manias, apoplexies, epilep&s;ies,</HI> during the <HI>horrors</HI> of all fevers, as well as in <HI>hy&s;terical, hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>a&s;thmatick</HI> attacks, particu|larly when the belly is bound, in con&s;equence of a <HI>&s;pa|&s;modick con&s;triction</HI> of the <HI>mu&s;cular fibres</HI> of the inte&s;tines,
<PB N="80" REF="010575_0080_0F80D1ABD5C33E48">
which prevents the &s;ecretions being made in them. But, when purgings happen in fevers, the urine is, commonly, thick or high coloured, and hath either a large &s;ediment or cloud; for the urinary organs, then partake of the &s;ame laxne&s;s with the other internal parts.</P>
<P>Limpid urine, is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed an unfavourable &s;ign in fevers, for it &s;hews a very exten&s;ive &s;trong &s;pa&s;m. But the mi&s;chief this portends, ought not to be imputed to the detention of any <HI>morbifick matter</HI> that &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed that way, &s;eeing the di&s;ea&s;e continued whil&s;t the urine was very thick, but to the &s;pa&s;m having com|municated it&s;elf to a greater number of ve&s;&s;els, and be|coming &s;tronger al&s;o, on tho&s;e it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before, whereby the fluids are repelled into fewer ve&s;&s;els and a &s;maller compa&s;s. In this ca&s;e, the mo&s;t alarming con&s;e|quences are to be dreaded, from the overfulne&s;&s;es and &s;tagnations that mu&s;t &s;oon en&s;ue in the internal and &s;u|periour parts. And we accordingly &s;ee, that either a <HI>dilirium, convul&s;ions, comatous</HI> or <HI>lethargick &s;tupors, mortal anxieties,</HI> &amp;c. infallibly &s;ucceed when &s;uch a change hap|pens in the urine, unle&s;s they can be prevented; but this is &s;eldom in our power, when patients, are much weakened.</P>
<P>Symptoms like tho&s;e we have ju&s;t now mentioned&punc; are &s;aid to happen <HI>per meta&s;ta&s;m,</HI> or from a tran&s;lation of the <HI>morbifick matter</HI> to the brain or el&s;ewhere. But that &s;ort of rea&s;oning explains nothing to me, who have &s;ome doubts of &s;uch matter exi&s;ting in the fluids, more e&s;pecially at the beginning of common continued, in|flammatory or even intermitting fevers, when &s;uch
<PB N="81" REF="010575_0081_0F80D1AC21794278">
&s;ymptoms are frequently &s;een. However, I can ea&s;ily comprehend how they may be brought on, by an aggra|vation of the &s;pa&s;m; which, as it mu&s;t take place before a fever can attack, &s;o mu&s;t it be removed ere the patient will recover, or become very general before a di&s;ea&s;e can prove mortal, as already hath been &s;aid.</P>
<P>When the urine is clear in fevers, it is commonly &s;ecret|ed in &s;mall quantities; but hy&s;terical and &s;ome other people, who&s;e nerves are very &s;en&s;ible, oftentimes di&s;charge aprofu&s;ion of urine, immediately after the attack of a <HI>&s;pa&s;m;</HI> which, pa&s;t all doubts, prevents ill con&s;equences in another way, that el&s;e would en&s;ue, when the fluids are thus precipitou&s;ly and impetuou&s;ly repelled towards the vi&s;cera and brain. Again, it for the mo&s;t part holds, that when the belly is loo&s;e in fevers, more e&s;pe|cially during warm weather, the urine will be high co|loured, or full of &s;ediment; and &s;o long as it continues &s;o, there is not much danger either of <HI>&s;tupors or convul|&s;ions,</HI> unle&s;s the patients &s;it up too long when they are very weak. At the time therefore, that the urine is clear in the fir&s;t days of fevers, it is a rule with me to re|move the &s;tricture of the ve&s;&s;els within, and abate what|ever overfulne&s;&s;es have happened there, by promoting loo&s;e &s;tools and &s;weatings likewi&s;e, in order to obviate the danger that would quickly follow, from the fluids being accumulated in the internal and &s;uperiour ve&s;&s;els. This, indeed, cannot be done, when the patient's &s;trength is already &s;pent by a lingering di&s;ea&s;e; but it may and ought to be attempted, at the beginning of common continued and inflammatory fevers, which oftentimes prove mortal on the third, fifth, or &s;eventh day; for in
<PB N="82" REF="010575_0082_0F80D1ACE1A2CF30">
&s;uch ca&s;es, enough of fluids generally remain to the la&s;t breath to &s;upport life, were the ve&s;&s;els but in condition to circulate them. They therefore who fall by di&s;orders of that &s;ort, truly die a violent death, as we have al|ready &s;aid. On the whole, though the examination of the urine be u&s;eful, as thence both the approach and completing of the <HI>cri&s;is</HI> may be pretty well known, yet in my opinion, it cannot be affirmed with any degree of propriety, that the body is &s;o commonly freed of the <HI>febrifick cau&s;e</HI> that way as is thought, if it be at all, un|le&s;s the di&s;temper aro&s;e from gravel in the pa&s;&s;ages; but we do not &s;peak of &s;uch complaints.</P>
<P>A <HI>cri&s;is</HI> is &s;aid to be brought about, by bleedings from the no&s;e, <HI>uterus</HI> and <HI>hemorrhoidal veins;</HI> and like|wi&s;e by a <HI>diarrhea,</HI> an <HI>expectoration,</HI> &amp;c. It cannot in|deed be denied, that a well-timed &s;uitable di&s;charge made in either of tho&s;e ways, will much abate the painful &s;ymptoms, by venting &s;ome part of the fluids, that were too much collected in the ve&s;&s;els within, and more &s;o in &s;ome than others, which being thus ea&s;ed of their over-fulne&s;&s;es, will now contract them&s;elves with greater power. And becau&s;e the &s;ame effects extend to others, in &s;ome degree, and al&s;o to the heart and lungs, the blood mu&s;t then he propelled with a greater <HI>impetus</HI> to|wards the con&s;tricted ve&s;&s;els, and &s;o dilate them gradu|ally. Yet after all, the &s;weat we mentioned mu&s;t &s;till en&s;ue, before a complete <HI>cri&s;is</HI> can happen, no matter by whatever natural or artificial di&s;charges, the overload, which took place in the ve&s;&s;els within, might be le&s;&s;en|ed. Does not what we have &s;aid of the humours being too much repelled from the outward to the internal parts
<PB N="83" REF="010575_0083_0F80D1ADF3EBFA18">
at &s;uch times, plainly appear among other things, from what happens to the &s;tronge&s;t man at the fir&s;t on&s;et of an inflammatory fever? for the pul&s;e is then &s;o &s;mall, the patient likewi&s;e being in all re&s;pects &s;o exceedingly weak and helple&s;s, becau&s;e the vital actions are as it were overpowered, that they who know not the rea&s;on, be|lieve no blood ought to be taken away; but after that hath been done, the &s;ick per&s;on perceives him&s;elf &s;tronger, and the pul&s;e al&s;o inlarges.</P>
<P>Fevers are &s;aid to cea&s;e, when the <HI>morbifick cau&s;e</HI> hap|pen to be thrown on the glandulous or other parts; but, though it be ea&s;y to conceive how ob&s;tructions of this &s;ort may be formed, yet in what manner they prove truly <HI>critical,</HI> tho&s;e mu&s;t declare to whom &s;uch in&s;tances have occurred. For my&s;elf, I always ob&s;erved that &s;ome degree of feveri&s;hne&s;s &s;till remained, till tho&s;e tu|mours were either di&s;cu&s;&s;ed or &s;uppurated; and even then the patient &s;weated at la&s;t before he recovered.</P>
<P>As to a <HI>critical diarrhea,</HI> it is ju&s;t what we propo&s;ed to bring on early in the di&s;ea&s;e; and if the patient hath the good fortune to &s;weat, when that happens of its own own accord, the &s;ame &s;alutary effects may probably en|&s;ue, as we find by promoting tho&s;e di&s;charges at the be|ginning, in order to relieve the ve&s;&s;els within of the &s;ur|charges they &s;u&s;tained, and perhaps clearing the fir&s;t pa&s;|&s;ages of &s;ome &s;ort of acrimony, that might either bring on or continue the &s;pa&s;m. But, whether this purging come on naturally, or was promoted by art, a general &s;weat mu&s;t neverthele&s;s follow, before the patient will be free of fever.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="010575_0084_0F80D1AE5DEE5698">Whether fevers can be removed in cold climates, without the &s;weat we mean, I will not di&s;pute; but in <HI>South-Carolina</HI> they never have a cri&s;is any other way; and how it can be otherwi&s;e el&s;ewhere, does not appear from the laws of mutual action between the &s;olids and fluids, or according to the foregoing theory. The dis|charge may not, indeed, be &s;o plentiful in cold countries as with us, in whom a laxer con&s;titution commonly pre|vails, for the greate&s;t part of the year.</P>
<P>My opinion of tho&s;e things is confirmed, by what authours have &s;aid of the different &s;orts of <HI>cri&s;es;</HI> for &s;uch increa&s;ed excretions could not have been made, unle&s;s the fluids were either too much collected in, or too plentifully determined towards the places whence they proceed. For it is plain, that had they circulated freely and equally throughout the &s;y&s;tem as in health, nothing of that nature could have happened, becau&s;e the &s;ecretions would not have exceeded any where, every part then receiving only its proper quantity of the fluids. Much le&s;s could a hemorrhage break out, except the ve&s;&s;els had fir&s;t been &s;o over-&s;tretched, that their coats were made to give way to the additional weight and <HI>impul&s;e</HI> of the blood. Neither could this have been, if the progre&s;s of the fluids had not been intercepted, in &s;ome degree, by &s;ome change made in the condition of the arteries in other parts. It then &s;eems clear, that &s;o much of the blood as could neither be received nor circulated by the ve&s;&s;els, which were <HI>&s;pa&s;modically affected,</HI> mu&s;t have been admitted by others, over and above what they ought to contain, had a re|gular di&s;tribution of it taken place, as we have already
<PB N="85" REF="010575_0085_0F80D1B28CBB71F8">
mentioned. An expectoration could no more happen in a <HI>peripneumony</HI> than from a <HI>diarrhea,</HI> unle&s;s the fluids had fir&s;t been unnaturally accumulated in the lungs, to augment the &s;ecretions there; and the extrava&s;at|ed humours acting as a &s;timulus, they excite a cough to expel them&s;elves. Have we not evident proofs of too great di&s;tention in the ve&s;&s;els, at or near the place, whence a future <HI>hemorrhage</HI> or an augmented &s;ecretion is to proceed, for &s;ome time before this happens? Is not a bleeding from the no&s;e, preceeded by a fulne&s;s and flu&s;hing of the face, throbbing of the <HI>carotid</HI> and <HI>tem|poral arteries,</HI> buzzing or ringing in the ears, and a heavine&s;s or pain in the eyes and forehead? How dif|ficult is breathing, and what heat and oppre&s;&s;ion are perceived about the brea&s;t in <HI>peripneumonies,</HI> and in the <HI>peripneumonick &s;tages of pleuri&s;ies,</HI> owing to the great weight of fluids, with which the lungs are charged? In the mortal &s;tages of all di&s;ea&s;es, how anxiou&s;ly do the patients to&s;s them&s;elves about, and ga&s;p in the quicke&s;t manner, becau&s;e of the &s;tifling from the fluids being mo&s;tly accumulated in the lungs and large ve&s;&s;els near the heart; the circulation being already at an end in the extreme parts? May it not be foretold that the men&s;es will &s;oon flow, when a heat, throbbing, heavi|ne&s;s and pain are perceived about the loins, hips and <HI>hypoga&s;trium?</HI> And, not to mention other things of the &s;ame &s;ort, when the circulation begins to recover it&s;elf in the external &s;mall arteries, the <HI>critical &s;weat</HI> may be announced, by a more equal heat, a plumpne&s;s of all the outward parts, and &s;oftne&s;s of the &s;kin, together with a fuller and le&s;s hard pul&s;e, a moi&s;ter tongue, and an abatement of the &s;ickne&s;s, anxiety, &amp;c. all plain
