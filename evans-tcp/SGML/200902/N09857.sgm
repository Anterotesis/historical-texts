<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Author of the following Ser|mons takes this method of inform|ing the Public, that they never were preached. The title and &s;tyle of Sermons were cho&s;en for no other purpo&s;e than to excite the attention of the Public to &s;ubjects highly intere&s;ting to every body. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to mention the Author's name, as he &s;eeks nothing from his countrymen, but the plea&s;ure of doing them good. If he fails in this, he is di&s;appointed in the only thing he had in view in writing them.</P>

<HEAD>DEDICATION, TO WILLIAM CADOGAN, M. D. FELLOW OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS IN LONDON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS embarked in the &s;ame common cau&s;e with you, of attempting to &s;ave the lives of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, I have taken the liberty of prefixing your name to the&s;e Sermons, not with the view of its protecting them, for it &s;eems it was not &s;ufficient to protect your own work, but from a de&s;ire I had of &s;howing my high e&s;teem of your head and heart. Although we differ in &s;ome points (which are chiefly &s;peculative) yet I am happy in finding that we agree in tho&s;e things which are mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, in one &s;en&s;e of the words, to man's &s;alvation. It is with plea|&s;ure we now &s;ee the &s;ame freedom of enquity extending it&s;elf to medicine, which has long prevailed in religion. While the common people reject infallibility in the head of a church, and a &s;overeign efficacy in a few rites and ceremonies, they have unhappily remained en|&s;laved
<PB REF="012547_0005_0F8ADB2C096FE4C0">
to the infallibility of medicine, or a few trifling pre&s;criptions, which are as unequal to the expectations of the vulgar in curing di&s;ea&s;es, as a wafer or extreme unction are to expiate their &s;ins. Phy&s;ic will never &s;uf|fer by undeceiving the common people; but, on the contrary, like the Reformed Religion, it will become illu&s;trious by &s;tripping it of its pageantry.&mdash; Thus, the Indian receives not half the plea&s;ure from wor&s;hipping the &s;un, which the philo&s;opher does from viewing it through a tele&s;cope.</P>
<P>THE clergy are not le&s;s honoured now than they were formerly, although they do not pretend to work miracles, or to grant ab&s;olution&mdash;&s;o phy&s;icians would not be le&s;s re&s;pected, &s;hould they &s;ometimes di&s;claim their u&s;urped omni&s;cience of the cau&s;es or events of di&s;|ea&s;es, nor attempt always to cure them by receipts com|po&s;ed of ingredients drawn from every kingdom in na|ture, and every quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>THE clergy are often told, that example goes farther than precept. Upon this account, I think it would add much to the dignity of phy&s;ic, if the profe&s;&s;ors of it would live agreeable to their doctrines.</P>
<P>AN OLD PHYSICIAN always carries about with him the mo&s;t honourable encomiums in prai&s;e of his art.&mdash; That you may honour the profe&s;&s;ion as much in this re&s;pect, as you have done in your ingenious Di&s;&s;ertation on the Gout, is the ardent wi&s;h of</P>

<P>When thou &s;itte&s;t to eat with a ruler, con&s;ider diligently what is before thee. And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite. Be not de&s;irous of his dainties, for they are deceitful meat.</P></Q>

<P>_THESE are the words of King Solomon, em|phatically called the Wi&s;e Man, from his great pre-eminence in wi&s;dom over the whole human race. His knowledge, like his plea&s;ures, was unconfined, and while he tortured nature for the one, he ran&s;acked her no le&s;s for the other. He was none of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who exclaim again&s;t the world for no other rea&s;on, than becau&s;e they po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o &s;mall a &s;hare of it. He ta&s;ted, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he knew every thing which the mind of man in its mo&s;t improved &s;tate is capable of ta&s;ting, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing, or knowing. This rai&s;es his character above all prai&s;e, and gives the &s;ame eloquence to every thing which comes from his pen, as if a voice had proclaimed it from heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="012547_0007_0F8ADB2D8A7692D8">WITHOUT taking up your time in wiredrawing the words, which are plain, and &s;tand in need of no illu&s;tration, I &s;hall proceed immediately to &s;peak of TEMPERANCE in EATING. The method I have cho&s;en for this purpo&s;e, is to con&s;ider it as it relates
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. To the QUALITY.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. To the QUANTITY of our ALIMENT. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. To the TIME of taking it. After this I &s;hall conclude with an APPLICATION.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. OF THE QUALITY OF OUR ALIMENT. There hath been much common-place declamation upon this &s;ubject. There is &s;uch a variety in the appetites and con&s;titutions of mankind (implanted originally for wi&s;e purpo&s;es) that no fixed rules can be laid down under this head. In general, the more &s;imple our food is, the better. Animal and vegetable food &s;hould always be mixed together by people in health.&mdash;That nature intended man &s;hould be &s;upported by them both, we infer from the &s;tructure of his teeth, and organs of dige&s;tion, which are formed upon the compound principles of carnivo|rous and granivorous animals. The proportion of vegetable food &s;hould always predominate, e&s;pecially in warm &s;ea&s;ons, and warm climates. Wild animals, and tho&s;e which are full grown, &s;hould be preferred to tame and young animals, as be|ing more ea&s;y of dige&s;tion and per&s;piration. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, fle&s;h which has been kept for &s;ome time, is to be preferred to that which is newly killed.</P>
<P>MUCH has been &s;aid again&s;t high &s;ea&s;oned food. To per|&s;ons, in the full vigor of health and youth, I grant it may be hurtful; but to old, and to &s;ickly people, who are afflicted with a general torpor of the alimentary canal, it is not only
<PB N="9" REF="012547_0008_0F8ADB2EA5E602D8">
inoffen&s;ive, but ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. I appeal to all &s;uch of my hearers, as labour under a weakne&s;s of the &s;tomach&mdash;indi|ge&s;tion&mdash;acid belchings, and the like, whether a little &s;alted or &s;moaked beef has not &s;at ea&s;ier upon your &s;tomachs, and been &s;ooner dige&s;ted, than the mo&s;t &s;imple food that could be contrived. High &s;ea&s;oned food is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to the inhabitants of low mar&s;hy countries, more e&s;pecially at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of the year, when the di&s;ea&s;es of &s;uch places are epi|demic. It is remarked in &s;ome of the We&s;t-Indian I&s;lands, as well as in tho&s;e parts of South-America, which are within the tropic, that &s;uch as eat a large quantity of &s;pices of all kinds, with their food, are le&s;s &s;ubject to the intermitting and bi|lious fevers, than tho&s;e who avoid them.&mdash;This is ea&s;ily ac|counted for, when we reflect, how much they obviate the re|laxing powers of heat and moi&s;ture, which always combine to produce the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. It is for this rea&s;on, probably, that Providence has &s;o ordered it, that the &s;picy trees grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly in warm climates only, in all parts of the world.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude this head, I &s;hall remark, that little mi&s;chief is done to the con&s;titution by the quality of aliment. Nature, for the mo&s;t part, takes the alarm, and, unle&s;s we u&s;e violence with her, deprives us of our reli&s;h for tho&s;e things, which are de&s;tructive to our con&s;titutions. Such per|&s;ons as love meat with tho&s;e qualities which are hurtful, too often love likewi&s;e an exce&s;s in quantity, which leads us to the next head we propo&s;ed, namely, to &s;peak</P>
<P N="2">II. OF THE QUANTITY OF OUR ALIMENT. "Temper|ance (&s;ays Sir William Temple) con&s;i&s;ts in a regular and &s;imple diet, limited by every man's experience of his own ea&s;y dige&s;tion."&mdash;Food, therefore, may be &s;aid to be taken in
<PB N="10" REF="012547_0009_0F8ADB2F1B2B4AB0">
too large a quantity, when we do not feel light and cheerful after it.&mdash;There are few who do not eat one third, or a fourth more than is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport them. The chief incentive to this is the variety of our di&s;hes, which excites us to eat after the appetite is &s;atisfied. Few men, I believe, ever eat to exce&s;s more than <HI>once</HI> of one plain di&s;h.</P>
<P>THE Church of Rome acts with a wi&s;e regard to the health, as well as morals of her &s;ons, in pre&s;cribing ab&s;tinence from fle&s;h during Lent, and in allowing them nothing but fi&s;h.&mdash; Mo&s;t of animals, in the &s;pring of the year, or the &s;ea&s;on of Lent, are very poor, and upon &s;everal accounts unfit for food; but the chief rea&s;on upon which this canon is founded, and which &s;erves our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e more immediately, is, that by confining them to fi&s;h only, there is le&s;s danger of their eating to exce&s;s. Nature, we &s;ee, not only in this, but in another &s;en&s;ual enjoyment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Let thy fountain be ble&s;&s;ed, and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. Let her be as the loving hind, and plea&s;ant roe; let her brea&s;ts &s;atisfy thee at <HI>all times</HI> and be thou ravi&s;hed <HI>always</HI> with her love. And why wilt thou my &s;on be ravi&s;hed with a &s;trange wo|man, and embrace the bo&s;om of a &s;tranger?</P>
<BIBL><HI>PROV. v. 18, 19, 20.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, &s;eems to have &s;et a guard over our health, and in&s;tead of rou&s;ing our &s;en&s;ations by va|riety or novelty, kindly keeps them &s;u&s;pended, till appetite and plea&s;ure are awakened together, which to the &s;ame ob|ject they never will be oftener than is con&s;i&s;tent with the health and vigor of the con&s;titution. This wi&s;e oeconomy in the make of our bodies, cannot be too much admired, e&s;pecially as we are enabled to di&s;cover in it the &s;trict connexion between the po&s;itive precepts of heaven, and our own happine&s;s.</P>
<P>NEXT to our eating of but one di&s;h, I would inculcate eating put one <HI>hearty</HI> meal a day. In &s;upport of this piece of
<PB N="11" REF="012547_0010_0F8ADB319827C6E0">
advice, I might here &s;ummons many of the illu&s;trious dead among the ancient philo&s;ophers and legi&s;lators, who never eat more than one hearty meal in the four and twenty hours. So common was this &s;implicity of living in Greece, that Plato, upon being a&s;ked when he returned to Athens from his travels into Sicily, what he had &s;een that was curious while he was abroad, an&s;wered, <HI>Vidi mon&s;trum in natura, hominem his &s;atu|ratum in die.</HI>&mdash;<Q>I have beheld (&s;aid he) a mon&s;ter in na|ture&mdash;a man who eat two hearty meals in a day.</Q> The&s;e are more than &s;ufficient to repair the daily wa&s;te of the body. They oppre&s;s nature, and keep her con&s;tantly fatigued, in concocting the immen&s;e &s;upplies of food which are thrown into the &s;tomach. Although &s;he &s;ometimes forbears long, yet &s;ooner or later &s;he takes ample vengeance of &s;uch as treat her in this manner, by afflicting them with blotches, and other di&s;orders, which are the legitimate offspring of this &s;pecies of intemperance. But if we are to eat only one hearty meal a day, a que&s;tion very naturally occurs here, and that is, at what time &s;hould it be taken?</P>
<P>THIS brings us to our la&s;t general head, namely, to &s;peak of temperance as it relates to the</P>
<P N="3">III. TIME OF EATING. At pre&s;ent noon is looked upon as the mo&s;t proper for this purpo&s;e. Hence we generally find dinner the principal meal through this country. I am aware of the difficulty of oppo&s;ing popular prejudices, and that it is often much better to &s;wim with the multitude down the &s;tream, than to &s;tem it alone. I am aware too of the fate of reformers in religion&mdash;politics and &s;cience. Many have lo&s;t their characters&mdash;their livings&mdash;and even their lives, by ad|vancing things contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions of the world. But, &s;hould this be my ca&s;e, I will not conceal my
<PB N="12" REF="012547_0011_0F8ADB33908CCD18">
&s;entiments, nor re&s;i&s;t what I look upon and feel to be the &s;a|cred power of truth. It is well known to every one, that exerci&s;e of mind or body is di&s;agreeable after dinner. Nature recoils from them both. Every full meal is a &s;timulus to the whole &s;y&s;tem and brings on a temporary fever, which &s;hows it&s;elf in that chilline&s;s and quickne&s;s of pul&s;e, which are &s;o very remarkable after eating. To add to the&s;e either exer|ci&s;e of body or mind, is to divide and weaken the powers of nature in a work, which requires the combined action of them all. Upon this account, I think the principal meal &s;hould al|ways be made in the evening.</P>
<P>THE old Romans, we find, in the early and virtuous ages of their commonwealth, made their chief meal after night. The French (except &s;uch of them as copy after the Engli&s;h manners) and the Italians always make &s;upper their principal meal. The Indians in this country (who live the mo&s;t agree|able to nature of any people in the world) eat fle&s;h but once in the four and twenty hours, and that is in the evening, after the fatigues of fi&s;hing&mdash;hunting or marching, are over. The Spaniards, who have not yet adopted the French and Italian cu&s;tom of making their chief meal at night, are neverthe|le&s;s &s;o unanimous in the practice of &s;leeping an hour or two every day after dinner, that it is a common thing to hear a Spaniard &s;ay, in mo&s;t of the cities of Spain, that "none but Engli&s;hmen and dogs are to be &s;een in their &s;treets immedi|ately after dinner." Sleep is always natural after eating. Nature calls loudly for it. It is common to all the brute animals we are acquainted with. That &s;tate of the body or mind which approaches neare&s;t to it, is always mo&s;t agreeable to us, when we cannot enjoy it immediately.&mdash;Hence we read, that it was a practice among the Romans to &s;it upon cu&s;hions, and to lean upon each other at their entertainments. Our SAVIOUR adopted this cu&s;tom. At the la&s;t fea&s;t he had with
<PB N="13" REF="012547_0012_0F8ADB345C6921E0">
his di&s;ciples (which was a &s;upper) he admitted him who &s;at next to him to lean upon his bo&s;om.&mdash;But what proves, above all things, that re&s;t and &s;leep are nece&s;&s;ary after eating, is, that dige&s;tion has been lately proved to be carried on chief|ly by FERMENTATION, to which re&s;t, every body knows, is &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, that it cannot take place without it. Unle&s;s the body enjoys more or le&s;s of this after eating, there can be no <HI>perfect</HI> concoction of the food. This is what all mu&s;t con&s;ent to, who have been obliged to ride on hor&s;e|back, or to u&s;e any violent exerci&s;e of body, after a hearty dinner. The dige&s;tion, in &s;uch ca&s;es, is &s;o di&s;turbed, that per&s;ons have complained of being indi&s;po&s;ed for &s;everal days after it.</P>
<P>BUT methinks I hear &s;ome object and &s;ay, that eating a hearty &s;upper makes them re&s;tle&s;s in the night, and prevents their &s;leeping. To &s;uch I would wi&s;h joy.&mdash;It is a proof, that nature has not yet &s;unk under the weight of two hearty meals a day; for I never heard any one make this complaint, who did not likewi&s;e eat a hearty dinner. Leave off dining in your u&s;ual manner, and, in&s;tead of eating half a pound, or a pound of fle&s;h, with vegetables proportioned to it, allay your appetite with a little bread and chee&s;e&mdash;a bowl of light &s;oup &mdash;a cup of coffee or chocolate&mdash;or, after the French cu&s;tom, with a few rai&s;ins, or an apple, and I am per&s;uaded, you will feel no inconvenience from eating a moderate &s;upper. Here give me leave to remark to you, that the more of the&s;e light &s;ub&s;tances you take during the day, the better, as they tend to le&s;&s;en the &s;en&s;e of hunger, or the keenne&s;s of the appetite, which too often provokes us to intemperance. Sir Francis Bacon tells us a &s;tory of a very old man, who&s;e manner of living he enquired into, and found that he ob&s;erv|ed no other rules than eating <HI>before</HI> he was hungry, and
<PB N="14" REF="012547_0013_0F8ADB3658F17F80">
drinking <HI>before</HI> he was dry; for by the&s;e means, he &s;aid, he was &s;ure never to eat, nor to drink too much at a time.&mdash; If we appeal once more to the brute animals, they will fur|ni&s;h us with arguments in favour of this practice. Every ana|logy borrowed from them de&s;erves to be attended to, as they have never yet &s;ubjected their in&s;tincts to the tyranny of fa&s;hi|on. The cow and the hor&s;e, as al&s;o the &s;heep, when they range at large in a pa&s;ture, feed with little interruption dur|ing the day, and thus guard again&s;t the intemperate effects of hunger. The hor&s;e, it is true, &s;ometimes &s;uffers from this cau&s;e, but it is only when he is obliged to live as we do, that is, to divide his meals into three or four in a day, and to work immediately afterwards. It is univer&s;ally agreed, that people live much longer in warm than in cold climates. May not one rea&s;on of this be owing to the heat of &s;uch climates dimi|ni&s;hing their appetites, and thus preventing their wearing out their con&s;titutions by exce&s;s in eating?&mdash;I would have it re|membered here, that in &s;peaking of warm climates, I mean the improved parts of A&s;ia and Africa only. The warm climates of America are as yet too little cultivated, to allow us to extend the ob&s;ervation to our own country.&mdash;But to re|turn. Methinks I hear others &s;ay, if we make &s;upper our principal meal, we &s;hall over&s;et part of an old rule, which bids us,
<Q><L>"After dinner &s;it a while,</L>
<L>"After &s;upper walk a mile."</L></Q>
This adage, it is true, from its great antiquity, as well as from its being delivered in rhyme, comes armed with the &s;trength of Samp&s;on, but it does not require the &s;kill of a Delilah to cut its locks. I might here mention an hundred common &s;ayings in &s;everal of the arts and &s;ciences, as well as in common life, which are equally univer&s;al, and at the &s;ame time equally fal&s;e with the above. It is a vulgar error, and
<PB N="15" REF="012547_0014_0F8ADB36DC612AD0">
is repugnant both to experience and &s;ound philo&s;ophy. I conclude, therefore, that it is mo&s;t agreeable to the u&s;age of the mo&s;t civilized nations&mdash;to the practice of &s;avages&mdash;to nature&mdash;and to common experience, to eat our chief meal at night, and that the &s;eeming objections again&s;t it are of no weight.</P>
<P>I HASTEN now to the APPLICATION of this di&s;cour&s;e. And here I might exclaim again&s;t the depravity of man, which has converted the common ble&s;&s;ings of life into wea|pons of de&s;truction again&s;t him&s;elf.&mdash;I might open Pandora's box, or &s;how you Milton's Lazar-hou&s;e,
<Q><L>&mdash;"Wherein were laid</L>
<L>"Numbers of all di&s;ea&s;ed, all maladies</L>
<L>"Of gha&s;tly &s;pa&s;m, or racking torture qualms</L>
<L>"Of heart-&s;ick agony, all &s;everous kinds,</L>
<L>"Convul&s;ions, epilep&s;ies, fierce catarrhs,</L>
<L>"Inte&s;tine &s;tone and ulcer, colic pangs,</L>
<L>"Demoniac phrenzy, moaping melancholy,</L>
<L>"And moon-&s;truck madne&s;s, pining atrophy,</L>
<L>"Mara&s;mus, and wide wa&s;ting pe&s;tilence,</L>
<L>"Drop&s;ies and a&s;thmas, and joint-racking rheums."</L></Q>
And might prove to you, that mo&s;t of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are the children of intemperance in eating. I might conduct you to yonder grave-yard, and point to the tombs of many of your former companions, who "came up like flowers, and were cut down," and who &s;trictly &s;peaking, "lived not out half their days."&mdash;But, without entering upon the&s;e things, I &s;hall conclude, by fixing your attention on the picture of a man, who has &s;pent part of his life "among riotous eaters of fle&s;h."&mdash;Mark his pale countenance! His belly is &s;welled&mdash; his phy&s;icians tell us that it ari&s;es from a fixed ob&s;truction in his liver, which has brought on a &s;pecies of drop&s;y of the
<PB N="16" REF="012547_0015_0F8ADB374879C4F0">
wor&s;t &s;ort&mdash;See! with what difficulty he breathe! A &s;low fever con&s;umes his vitals&mdash;His thir&s;t is inextingui&s;hable&mdash;Say ye patrons and practicers of the healing art, can nothing be done to relieve him from this deplorable condition?&mdash;Call for &s;ome rich dainty&mdash;Perhaps this may revive him&mdash;Tell him of his pa&s;t enjoyments&mdash;of the honour he once had of eating and drinking with the "Rulers" and chief men of the land. Alas! the&s;e can avail nothing.&mdash;The &s;ight of the one&mdash;and the remembrance of the other, &s;erve only to increa&s;e his pain.&mdash; Will cordials and bitters do nothing to rou&s;e the languid powers of life? Their virtues have long ago been exhau&s;ted, when there was no occa&s;ion for them. Better, far better, would it have been for him, had he (in the words of our text) "put a knife to his throat," or even plunged a dagger into his heart the fir&s;t day he gave him&s;elf up to his appetite, than lived to endure &s;uch aggravated mi&s;ery. In a word, all nature is up in arms again&s;t him&mdash;The elements keep back their medicinal aids&mdash;They take part in their Creator's quar|rel, who&s;e bounties he has abu&s;ed&mdash;The air refu&s;es to expand his lungs&mdash;water&mdash;to allay his thir&s;t&mdash;fire&mdash;to warm his limbs, and thus he dies his own executioner. Be exhorted, my hearers, from the&s;e con&s;iderations to temperance and &s;o|briety. If you have any love for your&s;elves&mdash;for your fami|lies&mdash;for your po&s;terity&mdash;and for the community to which you belong, think of the&s;e things. I have only to add my be&s;t wi&s;hes, that what has been delivered upon this &s;ubject may have due weight with you, more e&s;pecially at this &s;ea&s;on of the year <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e Sermons were written about Chri&s;tmas.</NOTE>, when, as the Poet expre&s;&s;es it,

<P>_THE la&s;t time I addre&s;&s;ed you from this place, I enlarged upon Temperance in Eating. In the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall lay before you a few con&s;iderations upon the USE AND ABUSE OF WINE AND STRONG DRINK. This, I &s;hall attempt, by con&s;idering more particularly the words of our text. For this purpo&s;e, I &s;hall enquire,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. TO WHOM WINE AND STRONG DRINK SHOULD BE GIVEN.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. TO WHOM THEY SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN; and then I &s;hall conclude with an APPLICATION.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="18" REF="012547_0017_0F8ADB38C934D790">I. WINE OR STRONG DRINK MAY BE GIVEN,</P>
<P N="1">1. To the &s;ick. The di&s;ea&s;es in which wine is indicated are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The <HI>&s;low nervous fever.</HI> Here the powers of na|ture are weakened and oppre&s;&s;ed, and the poor patient may, &s;trictly &s;peaking, be &s;aid to be ready to peri&s;h. Wine may be admini&s;tered therefore in &s;uch ca&s;es with advantage.&mdash;If ever it fails of doing, &s;ervice, it is becau&s;e it is given in too &s;mall a quantity. <HI>Secondly,</HI> In chronic di&s;ea&s;es, which are ac|companied with a languor of the whole &s;y&s;tem, which &s;hows it&s;elf in a more e&s;pecial manner in the <HI>&s;tomach,</HI> wine is a &s;o|vereign remedy. It was to relieve a complaint of this kind that St. Paul pre&s;cribed it to his &s;on Timothy. By its gentle &s;timulus it excites the action of the &s;tomach&mdash;invigorates the circulation&mdash;opens ob&s;tructions&mdash;and thus, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, renews the whole con&s;titution. The relief which wine af|fords in the&s;e ca&s;es, is the more certain, if the weakne&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem has been brought on by grief, or any of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which are of the &s;edative kind. Here the heavy heart is re|vived, and made to &s;ing for joy.</P>
<P N="2">2. WINE is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to the inhabitants of low mar&s;hy countries. The moi&s;ture of &s;uch places ob&s;tructs per|&s;piration, and brings on a general laxity of the &s;y&s;tem. When u&s;ed in a moderate quantity, it braces the &s;olids, and by keeping up a proper balance between them and the fluids, it obviates di&s;ea&s;es.&mdash;Hence we &s;eldom find tho&s;e people, who live in affluence, and who can afford to drink a gla&s;s or two of generous wine every day, afflicted with tho&s;e fevers and agues, which make &s;uch great havock among poor people. The Hollanders have been charged with the national reflec|tion of loving &s;trong drink. This cen&s;ure is unju&s;t, as nece&s;|&s;ity at fir&s;t drove them to it, and as it is by u&s;ing wine and other &s;pirituous liquors in moderation, that they guard them|&s;elves
<PB N="19" REF="012547_0018_0F8ADB3A3626EA40">
from the ill effects of the moi&s;ture to which their coun|try is always expo&s;ed. Remember you are to u&s;e wine in the&s;e ca&s;es only during that &s;ea&s;on, in which the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are epi|demic, which, in this climate, is chiefly during the months of Augu&s;t, September and October. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. WINE is principally u&s;eful to old people, or &s;uch as are in the decline of life. It is hard to fix the limits between the beginning of old age, and the clo&s;e of manhood. At a medi|um, the body begins to decline at the age of forty-five or fifty in this climate. Then the hot fit of the fever of life begins to abate, and from the many di&s;appointments in love&mdash;friend&s;hip &mdash;ambition or trade, which mo&s;t of men meet with by the time they arrive at this age, they generally feel a heavy heart.&mdash;The decay of the vital heat&mdash;the &s;lowne&s;s of the pul&s;e&mdash; the diminution of the &s;trength, all &s;how that the vigour of the &s;y&s;tem is declining. Here wine prolongs the &s;trength and powers of nature. It is the grave of pa&s;t misfortunes&mdash;In a word, it is another name for philo&s;ophy. Remember, my aged hearers, if you would expect to enjoy a long reprieve from the infirmities of age, you mu&s;t begin to u&s;e wine mode|rately, and increa&s;e the quantity of it as you de&s;cend into the valley of life.&mdash;Add to this, you mu&s;t dimini&s;h the quantity of your &s;olid aliment.&mdash;This nature points out to us, by depriv|ing us of our teeth in proportion as we grow old, teaching us thereby, that we have now no longer u&s;e for them.</P>
<P>I COME now to the &s;econd general head of my di&s;cour&s;e, namely,</P>
<P N="2">II. TO SHOW TO WHOM WINE OR STRONG DRINK SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="012547_0019_0F8ADB3A5C5BB078">IN the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, it &s;hould not be given to children. Wine, we &s;aid formerly, is of a heating nature, and is indi|cated in tho&s;e con&s;titutions and ages, where a &s;timulus is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the powers of life. Children, from the natural vigour of their &s;y&s;tems, which &s;hows it&s;elf in the re|markable quickne&s;s of their pul&s;es, and in their great activity of mind and body, &s;tand in no need of a &s;timulus of this kind. On the contrary, every thing &s;hould be withheld from them, which tends to add to the natural impetuo&s;ity of their fluids, or the vigorous action of their &s;olids. Hence we are led to commend tho&s;e parents, who forbid their children to ta&s;te all kinds of animal food (upon the account of its &s;timulating quality) till they are upwards of &s;even or eight years of age. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. STUDIOUS people, or tho&s;e who have occa&s;ion to ex|erci&s;e their thinking faculties much, &s;hould ab&s;tain from wine. Thinking is a &s;timulus to the con&s;titution, and wears out the &s;prings of life beyond the mo&s;t laborious exerci&s;e of body.&mdash;Much &s;tudy is literally a "wearine&s;s of the fle&s;h."&mdash;Hence we find &s;tate&s;men, generals, and even &s;uch as fill the learned pro|fe&s;&s;ions with dignity, are more &s;ubject to the gout, from &s;mall deviations in their ordinary way of living, than other people. Wine, and a con&s;tant or vigorous exertion of the active facul|ties of the &s;oul, produce nearly the &s;ame effects upon the bo|dy.&mdash;This is one rea&s;on probably why Solomon, in the chapter from whence our text is taken, &s;ays, "It is not for Kings to drink wine, nor for Princes &s;trong drink." Much recreation and great exerci&s;e of body, are nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t the effects of too much application of the mind to bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;hould the &s;timulating effects of wine be added to this, relief will be &s;ought from exerci&s;e and amu&s;ements in vain. But,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="21" REF="012547_0020_0F8ADB3B01064C70">3. WINE &s;hould not be u&s;ed by young people, or &s;uch as are under five and thirty or forty years of age, unle&s;s they la|bour under &s;ome of tho&s;e evils we mentioned under our fir&s;t head. The pur&s;uits and plea&s;ures of youth are too often more than &s;ufficient to keep the &s;y&s;tem in an excited &s;tate. To add wine to the&s;e, is like throwing oil into fire, in order to extin|gui&s;h it. It is always a &s;ign of a vitiated heart, when in full health wine is called for, in order to impart cheerfulne&s;s to it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Oh! &s;eldom may the fatal hour return,</L>
<L>Of drinking deep! I would not daily ta&s;te,</L>

<BIBL>ARMSTRONG'S <HI>Art of pre&s;erving health, Book II.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. By avoiding wine in the early part of life, you will receive benefit from it when you grow old. You will likewi&s;e e&s;cape that dreadful &s;courge of intemperance the gout. This is the natural offspring of wine. In the great empire of China the gout is unknown. This is owing to their being unacquainted with the juice of the grape, and is a proof that the other cau&s;es, which have been accu&s;ed of bringing on the gout, act too feebly to produce it, unle&s;s they are rou&s;ed into action by the u&s;e of wine. Be&s;ides all this, by refraining from wine during this period of your lives, you may become the fathers of a healthful progeny, who&s;e ruddy looks, and well formed limbs, will adorn your happy board, and more than repay you for your ab&s;tinence and &s;elf-denial.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="012547_0021_0F8ADB401FA00DD8">BUT methinks I hear &s;ome of you &s;ay&mdash;why all this noi&s;e about wine and &s;trong drink?&mdash;Have we not &s;een hundreds, who have made it a con&s;tant practice to get drunk almo&s;t every day for thirty or forty years, who, notwith&s;tanding, ar|rived to a great age, and enjoyed the &s;ame good health as tho&s;e who have followed the &s;tricte&s;t rules of temperance&mdash;or who have lived by weight and mea&s;ure like Lewis Cor|naro him&s;elf?&mdash;Some in&s;tances of this kind I grant might be mentioned, but they are few when compared with the num|ber of tho&s;e who have ab&s;tained from wine and &s;trong drink. Even the&s;e have began to drink after their con&s;titutions were on the decline. They were moreover generally poor people, who were obliged to work hard for their &s;upport, and thus by their labour carried off the effects of their intemperance. But who knows how much longer they might have lived, had they been more temperate. Perhaps after all, they died mar|tyrs to &s;pirituous liquors, and at the age of eighty, ninety, or even an hundred, were guilty of a &s;pecies of &s;uicide. If you &s;hould &s;ee a &s;ailor fall from the ma&s;t of a &s;hip under full &s;ail into the &s;ea, and afterwards be taken up alive, would you not think his companions mad, if they &s;hould leap from the &s;ame place, in hopes of meeting with the &s;ame good fortune?&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT who is he that &s;ays, if we bani&s;h wine from company, how &s;hall we contrive to entertain our friends? The poets and philo&s;ophers of former ages, who abound &s;o much with the prai&s;es of wine, would ri&s;e up again&s;t us, &s;hould we tear &s;o precious a relict from the temple of ho&s;pitality. To this I an&s;wer, that more have complained of drinking too much, than of drinking too little in company. How many have refu&s;ed to be pre&s;ent at entertainments, only becau&s;e they were afraid of being forced to drink to exce&s;s? How many are obliged to counterfeit excu&s;es, or to &s;teal privately from company for
<PB N="23" REF="012547_0022_0F8ADB43EB08B558">
the &s;ame rea&s;on? What confu&s;ion&mdash;what di&s;cord, among the mo&s;t intimate friends, have you not &s;een follow tho&s;e fea&s;ts where the ho&s;t has relied upon the quantity or goodne&s;s of his wine for the entertainment of his gue&s;ts?&mdash;Three or four gla&s;&s;es of wine will impart all its cheerful qualities to a &s;tomach which is not rendered in&s;en&s;ible to it by habit or di&s;ea&s;e. The&s;e may be taken occa&s;ionally among friends by per&s;ons of all ages and conditions, e&s;pecially upon fe&s;tive &s;ea&s;ons. The&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, however, &s;hould not recur too often. Our SAVIOUR wrought a miracle at a wedding, in order to furni&s;h wine to the gue&s;ts; but he fed five thou&s;and people with a few loaves and fi&s;hes in the wilderne&s;s, without ordering any wine to be drank after them. This is the more remarkable, as there is no food which is &s;uppo&s;ed to require wine with it &s;o much as fi&s;h,&mdash;it being a common &s;aying, that it &s;hould always &s;wim three times&mdash;namely, in water&mdash;butter&mdash;and wine.</P>
<P>IT is time now to ha&s;ten to the APPLICATION of this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>HERE then I would call upon the di&s;ea&s;ed and the melancho|ly part of my hearers, as well as &s;uch who&s;e misfortune it is to live in low mar&s;hy countries, to come and partake of this &s;overeign antidote to di&s;ea&s;e and care.&mdash;Bani&s;h your cordials&mdash;your bitters, and your magne&s;ias, the paltry pre&s;criptions of mercenary quacks, and &s;ub&s;titute in the room of them a few gla&s;&s;es of good old wine. But to you my aged hearers&mdash;my venerable fathers would I chiefly addre&s;s my&s;elf. Come here and drown all your &s;orrows in full bumpers of Li&s;bon or Ma|deira.&mdash;Here forget the incon&s;tancy of your mi&s;tre&s;&s;es&mdash;the the per&s;idy of friends&mdash;the broken promi&s;es of your patrons&mdash;and the villainy of tho&s;e who have betrayed either your in|tere&s;t, or character.&mdash;Above all things, here you may forget
<PB N="24" REF="012547_0023_0F8ADB4410FD7CC0">
not only to complain, but even to feel mo&s;t of tho&s;e infirmities which are too often connected with your age. "The keepers of the hou&s;e, &s;hall cea&s;e to tremble&mdash;nor &s;hall the &s;trong men bow them&s;elves, and although your grinders may cea&s;e, be|cau&s;e they are few, yet tho&s;e that look out of the windows, &s;hall not be darkened.&mdash;Ye &s;hall not ri&s;e at the voice of the bird, unable to &s;leep any longer, nor &s;hall the gra&s;s-hopper any more be a burthen to you." The days &s;hall never come in which you &s;hall &s;ay, "we have no plea&s;ure in them." Thus will you prolong your health and &s;pirits till, like full matured fruit, you &s;hall drop into the lap of your mother earth. Your bodies, like the garments of the children of I&s;rael, &s;hall not be torn by the ravages of time&mdash;and the &s;ame &s;troke which puts an end to your enjoyments, &s;hall cut the &s;ilver cord of life.</P>
<P>IT is now time to addre&s;s my&s;elf to another cla&s;s of my hearers. Fir&s;t, let me call upon parents to withhold wine from their children. It is a poi&s;on in&s;tead of a cordial, which you pour down their little throats. No fortune which you can bequeath them, will ever be equivalent for depriving them of the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing of a good con&s;titution. Next, let me call upon &s;tate&s;men, legi&s;lators, and all tho&s;e who labour for the public good, to ab&s;tain from wine. Remember you are the guardians of your country. Public bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould, like time, have no pau&s;es. How often have treaties been &s;u&s;pend|ed, and even marches and battles been delayed, by the prin|cipals or leaders of them being laid up with a fit of the gout. Suffer not the &s;hort lived plea&s;ures of drinking to cheat you out of your fame or importance, or to ob&s;truct your motions through the&s;e exalted &s;pheres which you are called to fill. But to you young men, would I now, in the la&s;t place, ad|dre&s;s my&s;elf.&mdash;You have heard &s;everal arguments again&s;t the
<PB N="25" REF="012547_0024_0F8ADB44D94617C0">
nece&s;&s;ity of your drinking wine. None of you can pretend to be of heavy hearts, or ready to peri&s;h. If you are not moved by a regard to your own health and happine&s;s&mdash;think of your po&s;terity. Let not your third and fourth generations be vi&s;ited for your iniquities. They will imprecate ven|geance upon your a&s;hes every time they feel the puni&s;hment of your folly.</P>
<P>BUT if, after all I have &s;aid, you are determined to per&s;e|vere in your u&s;ual manner of living, I mu&s;t addre&s;s you once more in the words of The Wi&s;e Man, and &s;ay, "Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the &s;ight of thine eyes;" yet remember there is a time coming when you will repent that you have hated reproof, and turned a deaf ear to the voice of the preacher. There is the &s;ame in&s;eparable connexion between intemperance and di&s;ea&s;e, that there is betwixt vice and its puni&s;hment. Unle&s;s you &s;hould be cut off by &s;ome &s;udden gu&s;t of intemperance, you may depend upon feeling the effects of it hereafter. Think now, I be&s;eech you, of the &s;leeple&s;s nights&mdash;of the low &s;pi|rits&mdash;of the &s;corching pains in your hands and feet which await you. To give you an idea of the dreadful con&s;equences of exce&s;s in drinking, let me beg of you to accompany me to the bed-chamber of a man afflicted with the gout. Be not alarmed at his groans&mdash;Let us go in&mdash;Is this the man who a few years ago was the life and &s;oul of every company he went into?&mdash;Is this he who boa&s;ted of the quantity of liquor he could drink without being intoxicated?&mdash;who &s;pent his youth in a con&s;tant round of gaity and plea&s;ure?&mdash;How is he changed!&mdash;It is now eleven years &s;ince he has been a pri&s;on|er in this chamber. His phy&s;icians have long &s;ince de&s;erted him, nor is it any reproach to their art that they cannot cure
<PB N="26" REF="012547_0025_0F8ADB4587D57E40">
him, any more than it is that they are unable to rai&s;e the dead. He is a burthen to his friends. In vain does he &s;eek relief from wine&mdash;food&mdash;phy&s;ic&mdash;company, or even from phi|lo&s;ophy. His only amu&s;ement is to number the days of his mi&s;ery on the wall with the chalk which grows on the ends of his fingers.&mdash;Death, the la&s;t friend of the wretched, refu&s;es to come at his call&mdash;He lives&mdash;I retract the word&mdash;He has cea&s;ed to live ever &s;ince his confinement&mdash;He breathes &s;hort|er and &s;horter, till at la&s;t he clo&s;es his eyes for ever in the &s;i|lence of death. This is no exaggerated picture. We have all &s;een it at &s;ome time of our lives.</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude what has been &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, with words more to our purpo&s;e than tho&s;e of Solomon, "Who hath wo? who hath &s;orrow? who hath contentions? who hath babling? who hath wounds without cau&s;e? who hath redne&s;s of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine, they that go to &s;eek mixt wine. Lock not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth it&s;elf aright. At the la&s;t it biteth like a &s;erpent, and &s;tingeth like an adder."</P>

<P>_MAN was formed to be active. The vigour of his mind, and the health of his body can be fully pre&s;erved by no other means, than by labour of &s;ome &s;ort. Hence, when we read the &s;entence which was pronounced upon man after the fall, "That in the &s;weat of his brow he &s;hould eat bread all the days of his life." We cannot help admiring the goodne&s;s of the Supreme Being, in connect|ing his puni&s;hment with what had now become the nece&s;&s;ary means of pre&s;erving his health. Had God abandoned him to idlene&s;s, he would have entailed tenfold mi&s;ery upon him. The &s;olid parts of his body, particularly the nerves, would have lo&s;t their tone&mdash;the mu&s;cles would have lo&s;t their feeling and moving powers&mdash;and the fluids in con&s;equence of this,
<PB N="28" REF="012547_0027_0F8ADB47286500E0">
would have lo&s;t their original or native qualities, and have &s;tagnated in every part of his body. But, in&s;tead of inflict|ing this complicated puni&s;hment upon him, he bids him be ACTIVE, and implants a principle within him which impels him to it. Civil &s;ociety and agriculture began together. The latter has always been looked upon among the fir&s;t employ|ments of mankind.&mdash;It calls forth every individual of the hu|man race into action.&mdash;It employs the body in a manner the mo&s;t conducive to its health.&mdash;It pre&s;erves and increa&s;es the &s;pecies mo&s;t;&mdash;and la&s;tly, it is mo&s;t friendly to the practice of virtue. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, therefore, it is natural to con|clude, that it is mo&s;t agreeable to the Supreme Being that man &s;hould be &s;upported by it. The earth is a &s;kilful as well as a kind mother to her children. In&s;tead of pouring her trea&s;ures in lapfuls upon them at once, and con&s;igning them to idlene&s;s ever afterwards, &s;he be&s;tows her gifts with a &s;paring hand, and cea&s;es to yield them any thing, as &s;oon as they cea&s;e to culti|vate her. Thus by entailing con&s;tant labour, &s;he meant to entail con&s;tant health upon them.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e employments were too innocent for the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of man. He &s;oon de&s;erted his fields&mdash;and his flocks&mdash;and &s;ought for &s;ome more &s;peedy methods of acquiring for|tune&mdash;independence&mdash;and a &s;uperiority over his fellow crea|tures. The&s;e have been obtained by commerce&mdash;war&mdash;ra|pine&mdash;and la&s;tly, to the reproach of the American colonies, and of humanity, be it &s;poken, by the perpetration of a crime, compared with which, every other breach of the laws of nature or nations, de&s;erves the name of Holine&s;s, I mean, by SLAVERY. But in exchange for the&s;e, he hath given up that greate&s;t of all ble&s;&s;ings, HEALTH. He hath had recour&s;e to medicine as a &s;uccedaneum for labour: but this hath proved ineffectual; for the fo&s;&s;il&mdash;vegetable&mdash;and tho&s;e parts of the animal king|dom

Solomon &s;eems to have been aware of this in the words of our text, and hence we hear him calling upon him to awake from his unhealthy "&s;lumber"&mdash;to ri&s;e from his enervating bed&mdash;to unfold his "arms," and employ them in &s;ome u&s;eful labour, lea&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, with its companion "poverty," &s;hould come upon him like "travail upon a woman with child," or like an "armed man," neither of which can be avoided or re&s;i&s;ted. But Solomon, and all the preachers from his time to the pre&s;ent day, who have addre&s;&s;ed him upon this &s;ubject, have u&s;ed their elo|quence in vain. Since therefore we cannot bring man back again to his implements of hu&s;bandry, we mu&s;t attempt to find out &s;ome kinds of exerci&s;e as &s;ub&s;titutes for them. The mo&s;t healthy and long-lived people are found among the la|bouring part of mankind&mdash;Would the rich then enjoy health and long life, they mu&s;t do that of choice which the&s;e people do of nece&s;&s;ity.

<P N="1">I. All Exerci&s;e may be divided into ACTIVE and PASSIVE.</P>
<P>ACTIVE EXERCISE includes walking&mdash;running&mdash;dancing &mdash;fencing&mdash;&s;wimming, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="012547_0029_0F8ADB48DBF1A7F0">PASSIVE EXERCISE includes &s;ailing&mdash;riding in a carriage, and on hor&s;eback. The la&s;t of the&s;e is of a mixed nature, and is in &s;ome mea&s;ure active as well as pa&s;&s;ive. We &s;hall treat of each of them in order.</P>
<P>OF ACTIVE EXERCISE.</P>
<P>WALKING is the mo&s;t gentle &s;pecies of it we are acquaint|ed with. It promotes per&s;piration, and if not continued too long, invigorates and &s;trengthens the &s;y&s;tem. As the mo&s;t &s;imple and whole&s;ome drink, namely water, is within every body's reach, &s;o this &s;pecies of &s;imple and whole&s;ome exerci&s;e is in every body's power, who has the u&s;e of his limbs. It is to be lament|ed, that carriages are &s;ub&s;tituted too often in the room of it. In Pekin in China, we are told, that none but the Emperor, and a few of the fir&s;t officers of &s;tate, are &s;uffered to u&s;e chariots. Although the intention of this law was to &s;uppre&s;s the num|ber of hor&s;es, in order to make room for the increa&s;e and &s;upport of the human &s;pecies, in the number of which the riches of all countries con&s;i&s;t, yet we find it attended with good effects otherwi&s;e; for the rich and the great, by being obliged to walk in common with the poor people, enjoy with them the common ble&s;&s;ing of health, more than people of the &s;ame rank in other countries. To &s;uch as can bear it, I would recommend walking frequently up a hill. The inha|bitants of mountainous countries are generally healthy and long lived. This is commonly attributed to the purity of the air in &s;uch places. Although this has a <HI>chief</HI> &s;hare in it, yet I cannot help thinking, that the frequent and nece&s;&s;ary exer|ci&s;e of climbing mountains, which the&s;e people are obliged to undergo, adds much to their health and lives. Every body knows how much walking up a hill tends to create an appe|tite. This depends upon its increa&s;ing the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;pi|ration&mdash;a &s;ecretion with which the appetite, and the &s;tate of the &s;tomach in general, are much connected.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="012547_0030_0F8ADB495AB08118">RUNNING is too violent to be u&s;ed often, or continued for any length of time. The running footmen in all countries are &s;hort-lived&mdash;Few of them e&s;cape con&s;umptions before they arrive at their thirty-fifth year.&mdash;Sweating and per&s;pira|tion, according to Sanctorius, have been found to be incom|patible.&mdash;The former always &s;uppre&s;&s;es the latter. Upon this account, I would recommend it to be u&s;ed as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>DANCING is a mo&s;t &s;alutary exerci&s;e. Future ages will be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear, that rational creatures &s;hould, at any time, have looked upon it as a criminal amu&s;ement. To rea&s;on again&s;t it, from its abu&s;e, concludes equally &s;trong again&s;t the lawfulne&s;s of every thing we hold &s;acred and va|luable in life.&mdash;It was a part of the Jewi&s;h wor&s;hip. By its mechanical effects on the body, it in&s;pires the mind with cheerfulne&s;s, and this, when well founded, and properly re|&s;trained, is another name for religion. It is common among the Indians, and the &s;avage nations of all countries, upon public and fe&s;tive occa&s;ions.&mdash;They have their war&mdash;their love&mdash;and their religious dances. The mu&s;ic, which always accompanies this exerci&s;e, hath a plea&s;ing and &s;alutary effect upon the body as well as the mind. It is addre&s;&s;ed through the avenue of the ears to the brain, the common centre of life and motion, from whence its o&s;cillations are communi|cated to every part of the &s;y&s;tem, imparting to each, that equable and uniform vigour and action, upon which the healthy &s;tate of all the functions depends. It would lead us to a long digre&s;&s;ion, or I might here mention many remark|able cures which have been performed, particularly of tho&s;e di&s;orders, which are much connected with the nervous &s;y&s;tem, by the magic power of mu&s;ic. Dancing &s;hould not be u&s;ed more than once or twice a week. It &s;hould never be

continued 'till wearine&s;s comes on, nor &s;hould we expo&s;e our|&s;elves to the cold air too &s;oon after at.</P>
<P>FENCING calls forth mo&s;t of the mu&s;cles into exerci&s;e, particularly tho&s;e which move the limbs. The brain is like|wi&s;e rou&s;ed by it, through the avenue of the eyes, and its action, as in the ca&s;e of mu&s;ic, is propagated to the whole &s;y&s;tem. It has long been a &s;ubject of complaint, that the human &s;pecies has been degenerating for the&s;e &s;everal cen|turies. When we &s;ee the coats of mail of our ance&s;tors, who fought under the Edwards and Henries of former ages, we wonder how they moved, much more how they atchieved &s;uch great exploits, beneath the weight of &s;uch ma&s;&s;y cover|ings. We grant that rum&mdash;tobacco&mdash;tea&mdash;and &s;ome other luxuries of modern invention, have had a large &s;hare in weak|ning the &s;tamina of our con&s;titutions, and thus producing a more feeble race of men; yet we mu&s;t attribute much of our great inferiority in &s;trength, &s;ize and agility to our forefa|thers, to the di&s;u&s;e which the invention of gun-powder and fire arms hath introduced of tho&s;e athletic exerci&s;es, which were &s;o much practi&s;ed in former ages, as a part of military di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>TOO much cannot be &s;aid in prai&s;e of SWIMMING, or as the poet of Avon expre&s;&s;es it&mdash;"buffeting the waves with lu&s;ty &s;inews." Be&s;ides exerci&s;ing the limbs, it &s;erves to wa&s;h away the du&s;t, which is apt to mix it&s;elf with the &s;weat of our bodies in warm weather. Wa&s;hing frequently in water, we find, was enjoined upon the Jews and Mahometans, as a part of their religious ceremonies. The Hollanders are clean|ly in their hou&s;es and &s;treets, without remembering, or per|haps knowing, that cleanline&s;s was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t, to guard again&s;t the effects of tho&s;e inundations of mire,
<PB N="33" REF="012547_0032_0F8ADB4DC2C74DC0">
to which their country is always expo&s;ed&mdash;&s;o a Jew and a Mu&s;&s;ulman contend for, and practi&s;e their ablutions, with|out remembering that they were in&s;tituted only to guard them again&s;t tho&s;e cutanious di&s;ea&s;es, to which the con&s;tant accu|mulation of &s;ordes upon their &s;kins in a warm climate, na|turally expo&s;ed them. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, I would &s;trong|ly recommend the practice of bathing, and &s;wimming, fre|quently in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. But remember, you &s;hould not &s;tay too long in the water at one time, lea&s;t you le&s;&s;en in&s;tead of increa&s;ing the vigour of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>TO all the&s;e &s;pecies of exerci&s;e which we have mentioned, I would add, SKEATING, JUMPING, al&s;o, the active plays of TENNIS, BOWLES, QUOITS, GOLF <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Golf is an exerci&s;e which is much u&s;ed by the Gentlemen in Scotland. A large common in which there are &s;everal little holes is cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e. It is played with little leather balls &s;tuffed with feathers; and &s;ticks made &s;omewhat in the form of a bandy-wicket. He who puts a ball into a given num|ber of holes, with the fewe&s;t &s;trokes, gets the game. The late Dr. M'KENZIE, Author of the e&s;&s;ay on Health and Long Life, u&s;ed to &s;ay, that a man would live ten years the longer for u&s;ing this exerci&s;e once or twice a week.</NOTE>, and the like. The man|ner in which each of the&s;e operate, may be under&s;tood from what we &s;aid under the former particulars.</P>
<P>ACTIVE exerci&s;e includes, in the la&s;t place, TALKING&mdash; READING with an AUDIBLE VOICE&mdash;SINGING and LAUGHING. They all promote the circulation of the blood thro' the lungs, and tend to &s;trengthen tho&s;e important or|gans, when u&s;ed in moderation. The la&s;t has the advantage over them all, ina&s;much as the mind co-operates with it. May unfading laurels bloom to the late&s;t ages upon the grave

of him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Sterne.</NOTE> who &s;aid, "That every time a man laughs, he adds &s;omething to his life."</P>
<P>I WOULD remark here, that all the&s;e &s;pecies of exerci&s;e which we have de&s;cribed, &s;hould be varied according to age&mdash; &s;ex&mdash;temperament&mdash;climate&mdash;and &s;ea&s;on. Young people &s;tand in le&s;s need of exerci&s;e than old.&mdash;Women le&s;s than men. The natural vigour of their con&s;titutions is &s;uch, that they &s;uffer <HI>lea&s;t</HI> from the want of it. This will explain the meaning, and &s;how the propriety of an opinion of a modern Philo&s;opher <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rou&s;&s;eau.</NOTE> that "Women only &s;hould follow tho&s;e mecha|nical arts which require a &s;edentary life." But again, a man who is phlegmatic, requires more frequent and violent exerci&s;e than he who is of a bilious con&s;titution: And la&s;tly, people in warm climates and &s;ea&s;ons, require le&s;s than tho&s;e who live in cold. As Providence, by &s;upplying the inhabitants of warm climates with &s;o many of the &s;pontaneous fruits of the earth, &s;eems to have intended they &s;hould labour le&s;s than the inha|bitants of cold climates, &s;o we may infer from this, that le&s;s exerci&s;e, which is only a &s;ub&s;titute for labour, is nece&s;&s;ary for them. The heat of &s;uch climates is &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to keep up a regular and due per&s;piration. We &s;aid in a former di&s;|cour&s;e, that the longe&s;t lived people were to be found in warm climates, and we gave one conjecture into the cau&s;e of it. It may not be improper here to add another. The coldne&s;s of northern climates, from the vigour it gives to the con&s;titution, prompts to all kinds of exerci&s;e, which are not always re&s;train|ed within proper bounds. The&s;e, when u&s;ed to exce&s;s, wear out the body. Thus, blowing a fire, may cau&s;e it to burn the brighter, but it con&s;umes it the &s;ooner. The inhabitants of warm climates being le&s;s prompted to the&s;e things, their bo|dies continue longer unimpaired. I confine this ob&s;ervation,
<PB N="35" REF="012547_0034_0F8ADB50F8606B38">
as in the former in&s;tance, to the improved parts of A&s;ia and Africa only. The inhabitants of the We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands are &s;o mixed, and partake &s;o much of the European manners, that we cannot as yet include them in any general remarks which are made upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I COME to &s;peak of tho&s;e exerci&s;es which are of a PASSIVE NATURE. The&s;e are proper chiefly for valetudinarians: But, as I intend the&s;e &s;ermons &s;hould be of u&s;e to them as well as the healthy, I &s;hall make a few remarks upon each of them.</P>
<P>THE life of a SAILOR is environed with &s;o many dangers, that Heaven has in compen&s;ation for them connected with it an exemption from many di&s;ea&s;es. In vain do the angry ele|ments a&s;&s;ault him. His body, like &s;ome huge promontory, is proof again&s;t them all. Notwith&s;tanding the dangers from &s;hipwreck&mdash;fire&mdash;falling over board&mdash;and famine, to which &s;ailors are expo&s;ed, I believe, that if we were to count an hundred &s;ailors, and the &s;ame number of people on land, in a place that was ordinarily healthy, we &s;hould find more of the former alive at the end of ten years than the latter. The exerci&s;e of SAILING is con&s;tant. Every mu&s;cle is occa&s;ionally brought into exerci&s;e from the efforts we make to keep our|&s;elves from falling. The&s;e efforts continue to be exerted by the olde&s;t &s;ailors, although the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the mind in the&s;e, as well as in many other actions we perform, is not ob|&s;erved from the influence of habit. By means of this regular and gentle exerci&s;e, the blood is moved in tho&s;e &s;mall capil|laries, where it is mo&s;t apt to &s;tagnate, and per&s;piration is in|crea&s;ed, which is carried off as fa&s;t as it is di&s;charged from the body, by the con&s;tant change of atmo&s;phere in a &s;hip under &s;ail. I &s;ay nothing here of the benefit of the &s;ea air, it being en|tirely negative. Its virtue both at &s;ea and on the &s;ea-&s;hore,
<PB N="36" REF="012547_0035_0F8ADB51875B2208">
con&s;i&s;ts in nothing but its being freed from tho&s;e noxious ani|mal and vegetable effluvia, which abound in the air, which comes acro&s;s land. From what has been &s;aid, you will no longer be &s;urpri&s;ed at the uncommon appetite which &s;ome peo|ple feel at &s;ea. It is owing to the great and con&s;tant di&s;charge of the aliment (after it has undergone its u&s;ual changes) by means of per&s;piration. I would recommend this &s;pecies of exerci&s;e to con&s;umptive people, e&s;pecially to &s;uch as labour under a &s;pitting of blood. Dr. Lind tells us <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on the means of pre&s;erving the health of &s;eamen.</NOTE>, "That out of 5741 &s;ailors who were admitted into the naval ho&s;pital at Ha&s;lar, near Port&s;mouth, in two years, only 360 of them had con&s;umptions, and in one fourth of the&s;e, (he &s;ays,) it was brought on by brui&s;es or falls." In the &s;ame number of ho&s;pi|tal patients, in this or any other country, I am per&s;uaded &s;ix times that number would have been con&s;umptive&mdash;&s;o much does the gentle exerci&s;e of &s;ailing fortify the lungs again&s;t all accidents, and determine the quantity and force of the fluids towards the &s;urface of the body.</P>
<P>RIDING IN A CHARIOT has but few advantages, ina&s;|much as we are excluded from the benefit of fre&s;h air; an article, upon which the &s;ucce&s;s of all kinds of exerci&s;e in a great mea&s;ure depends. It &s;hould be u&s;ed only by &s;uch per|&s;ons as are unable to walk or to ride on hor&s;eback. We can|not help lamenting here, that tho&s;e people u&s;e this mode of exerci&s;e the mo&s;t, who &s;tand in the greate&s;t need of a more violent &s;pecies of it.</P>
<P>RIDING ON HORSEBACK is the mo&s;t manly and u&s;eful &s;pecies of exerci&s;e for gentlemen. Bi&s;hop Burnet expre&s;&s;es his &s;urprize at the lawyers of his own time, being &s;o much more long-lived <HI>(<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">eteris paribus)</HI> than other people, con&s;ider|ing

how much tho&s;e of them who become eminent in their profe&s;&s;ion, are obliged to devote them&s;elves to con&s;tant and inten&s;e &s;tudy. He attributes it entirely to their RIDING the circuits &s;o frequently, to attend the different courts in every part of the kingdom. This no doubt has a chief &s;hare in it: But we &s;hall hereafter mention another cau&s;e which concurs with this, to protract their lives. It may be varied according to our &s;trength, or the nature of our di&s;order, by walking&mdash; pacing&mdash;trotting&mdash;or cantering our hor&s;e. All tho&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es which are attended with a weakne&s;s of the nerves, &s;uch as the hy&s;teric and hypochondriac di&s;orders, which &s;how them|&s;elves in a weakne&s;s of the &s;tomach and bowels&mdash;indige&s;tion &mdash;low &s;pirits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> require this exerci&s;e. It &s;hould be u&s;ed with caution in the con&s;umption, as it is generally too violent, except in the early &s;tage of that di&s;order. In riding, to pre|&s;erve health, eight or ten miles a day are &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es we would wi&s;h for. But in riding, to re&s;tore health, the&s;e little excur&s;ions will avail nothing. The mind as well as the body mu&s;t be rou&s;ed from its languor. In <HI>taking an airing,</HI> as it is called, we ride over the &s;ame ground for the mo&s;t part every day. We &s;ee no new objects to divert us, and the very con&s;ideration of our riding for health &s;inks our &s;pirits &s;o much, that we receive more harm than good from it. Upon this account I would recommend long journies to &s;uch people, in order, by the variety or novelty of the journey to awaken and divert the mind. Many people have by the&s;e means been &s;ur|pri&s;ed into health. Per&s;ons who labour under hy&s;teric or epileptic di&s;orders, &s;hould be &s;ent to cold; tho&s;e who labour under hypochondriac or con&s;umptive complaints &s;hould vi&s;it warm climates.</P>
<P>BEFORE I fini&s;h this head of our di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall add a few words concerning the exerci&s;e of the faculties of the &s;oul.
<PB N="38" REF="012547_0037_0F8ADB5309D5F5A8">
The mind and body have a reciprocal action upon each other. Are our pa&s;&s;ions inflamed with de&s;ire or aver&s;ion? Or does our rea&s;on trace out relations in tho&s;e things which are the ob|jects of our under&s;tanding?&mdash;The body we find is brought in|to &s;ympathy. The pul&s;e and the circulation of the blood are immediately quickened. Per&s;piration and the other &s;ecretions are promoted, and the body is &s;en&s;ibly invigorated afterwards. The body partakes therefore of the torpor which the mind contracts by its neglecting to exerci&s;e its faculties. He mu&s;t be but little acquainted with biography, who has not remarked, that &s;uch as have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the literary world, have generally been long-lived. ADDISON, SWIFT, LOCKE, NEWTON, FRANKLIN, with many others whom we might mention, all found a retreat in the evening of their lives un|der the &s;hade of laurels which they had planted in their youth. Perhaps in mo&s;t ca&s;es, they might promi&s;e them|&s;elves an exemption from di&s;ea&s;es, and a death from mere old age, could they be per&s;uaded to relinqui&s;h their midnight lamp before the oil which feeds it was con&s;umed. Great care &s;hould be taken, however, to avoid too great application of the mind to &s;tudy. The mo&s;t powerful medicines in nature are the mo&s;t certain poi&s;ons. Many promi&s;ing geniu&s;es have &s;acrificed them&s;elves, before they arrived at the altar in the Temple of Fame. Such as are in danger of &s;uffering from this cau&s;e, will do well in con&s;ulting the ingenious and humane Dr. Ti&s;&s;ot's excellent treati&s;e upon the di&s;ea&s;es of literary peo|ple. The PASSIONS as well as our rea&s;on, &s;hould always be exerci&s;ed as much as po&s;&s;ible. We &s;hall walk&mdash;run&mdash;dance&mdash;&s;wim&mdash;fence&mdash;&s;ail&mdash;and ride to little purpo&s;e, unle&s;s we make choice of an agreeable friend to accompany us. Soli|tude is the bane of man; in&s;omuch, that it is difficult to tell which &s;uffers mo&s;t, the &s;oul in its qualities, or the body in its temperament, from being alone. Too great a concour&s;e of
<PB N="39" REF="012547_0038_0F8ADB53CECBA8A0">
people breeds di&s;ea&s;es. Too much company is de&s;tructive to cheerfulne&s;s. For the &s;ake of both mind and body, there|fore, we &s;hould move in a little circle, and let heaven circum|&s;cribe it for us. Let our wives and children be always around us, or if we are not ble&s;&s;ed with the&s;e, let a few cheerful friends be our con&s;tant companions. It is remarked, that more &s;ingle people die among tho&s;e who are come to man|hood than married, and all phy&s;icians agree, that &s;ingle men and women, compo&s;e by far the greate&s;t number of their chronic patients among adults. Some men may talk again&s;t the cares of a family. They are unavoidable, it is true, but they are nece&s;&s;ary. Stagnating waters are never &s;weet. Thus, the&s;e little cares, by keeping the tenderer pa&s;&s;ions always agitated, prevent that uniformity in life, which is &s;o foreign and di&s;agreeable both to the body and mind. After all, I believe, I &s;hall have the &s;uffrages of mo&s;t of my hearers, when I add, that they are at lea&s;t balanced by the &s;weets of dome&s;tic friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>WE come now to the next head of our di&s;cour&s;e, namely,</P>
<P N="2">II. To enquire into the proper TIME for EXERCISE&mdash; Sanctorius informs us <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. V.

If this be true, then (&s;uppo&s;ing you &s;up at eight o'clock in the evening) that exerci&s;e which is u&s;ed from five 'till &s;even o'clock in the morning, will promote the greate&s;t di&s;charge in a given time, by in&s;en&s;ible per|&s;piration. Such as make dinner their principal meal, are ex|cluded from the benefit of this aphori&s;m; as the interval, be|tween the &s;eventh and the eleventh hour, with them (&s;up|po&s;ing they dine at two o'clock in the afternoon) is from nine

<P>BUT further&mdash;there is another rea&s;on why I would re|commend this practice of eating the chief meal in the even|ing, which is indeed a little foreign to our pre&s;ent &s;ubject.&mdash; In a country like this, where the con&s;tant labour of every in|dividual is &s;o very nece&s;&s;ary, the general u&s;e of this cu&s;tom would add &s;everal hours to every day, and thus have the mo&s;t beneficial effects upon the agriculture&mdash;commerce&mdash;and ma|nufactures of the country, exclu&s;ive of its influence upon the health of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>AFTER what has been &s;aid, I need hardly add, that exer|ci&s;e &s;hould never be u&s;ed with a full &s;tomach. Per&s;ons who exerci&s;e either to pre&s;erve, or re&s;tore health immediately after eating a hearty meal, re&s;emble the man "who fled from a

lion, and a bear met him, and who went into the hou&s;e, and leaned his hand upon the wall, and a &s;erpent bit him."</P>
<P>I COME now to the APPLICATION of this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I HAVE endeavoured in every part of it, to lay before you the mo&s;t powerful arguments, to excite you to exerci&s;e, and have addre&s;&s;ed them chiefly to that main &s;pring of human actions&mdash;SELF PRESERVATION. I have taught you the true art of alchymy, and furni&s;hed you with the genuine Philo|&s;opher's &s;tone, but with this difference from that which has been &s;ought for, by the deluded pretenders to philo&s;ophy in all ages, that in&s;tead of converting, like Midas, every thing you touch into gold&mdash;every thing which touches you &s;hall&mdash;not convert you into gold&mdash;but impart HEALTH to you&mdash;com|pared with which, even the gold of Ophir lo&s;es its weight. In a word&mdash;I have &s;howed you an harbour where I have anchored &s;afely for many years; for, from my youth upwards, I have followed the mode of living I have recommended to you, as far as my connections or intercour&s;e with the world would ad|mit; and although I received from nature a weakly con|&s;titution, yet&mdash;I &s;peak it with a grateful heart!&mdash;few men enjoy better health&mdash;none better &s;pirits than my&s;elf; and was I now about to leave the world, &s;urrounded with a family of children, I would charge them, among the mo&s;t important le&s;&s;ons I &s;hould give them, to bind the&s;e things as a "a &s;ign upon their hands, or as frontlets between their eyes"&mdash;to think of them "when they &s;at in their hou&s;es, and when they walked by the way&mdash;when they lay down, and when they ro&s;e up&mdash;that their days might be multiplied; and that the days of their children, might be as the days of Heaven upon the earth."</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="012547_0041_0F8ADB56960B18D0">I SHALL conclude this di&s;cour&s;e with a &s;tory, which, I hope, will not be looked upon as foreign to what has been delivered upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IN the i&s;land of Ceylon, in the Indian ocean, a number of invalids were a&s;&s;embled together, who were afflicted with mo&s;t of the chronic di&s;ea&s;es, to which the human body is &s;ub|ject. In the mid&s;t of them &s;at &s;everal venerable figures, who amu&s;ed them with encomiums upon &s;ome medicines, which they a&s;&s;ured them would afford infallible relief in all ca&s;es. One boa&s;ted of an elixir&mdash;another of a powder, brought from America&mdash;a third, of a medicine, invented and prepared in Germany&mdash;all of which they &s;aid were certain antidotes to the gout&mdash;a fourth, cried up a no&s;trum for the vapours&mdash; a fifth, drops for the gravel&mdash;a &s;ixth, a bal&s;am, prepared from honey, as a &s;overeign remedy for a con&s;umption&mdash;a &s;eventh, a pill for cutanious eruptions&mdash;while an eighth cried down the whole, and extolled a mineral water, which lay a few miles from the place where they were a&s;&s;embled. The credulous multitude partook eagerly of the&s;e medicines, but without any relief of their re&s;pective complaints. Several of tho&s;e who made u&s;e of the German preparation; were hurried &s;ud|denly out of the world. Some &s;aid their medicines were adulterated&mdash;others that the Doctors had mi&s;taken their di&s;|orders&mdash;while mo&s;t of them agreed that they were much wor&s;e than ever. While they were all, with one accord, giving vent in this manner, to the tran&s;ports of di&s;appoint|ment and vexation, a clap of thunder was heard over their heads. Upon looking up, a light was &s;een in the &s;ky.&mdash;In the mid&s;t of this appeared the figure of &s;omething more than human&mdash;&s;he was tall and comely&mdash;her &s;kin was fair as the driven &s;now&mdash;a ro&s;y hue tinged her checks&mdash;her hair hung loo&s;e upon her &s;houlders&mdash;her &s;lowing robes di&s;clo&s;ed a &s;hape
<PB N="43" REF="012547_0042_0F8ADB58901DBB80">
which would have ca&s;t a &s;hade upon the &s;tatue of Venus of Medicis.&mdash;In her right hand &s;he held a bough of an EVER|GREEN&mdash;in her left hand &s;he had a &s;croll of parchment&mdash;&s;he de&s;cended &s;lowly, and &s;tood erect upon the earth&mdash;&s;he fixed her eyes, which &s;parkled with life, upon the deluded and afflicted company&mdash;there was a mixture of pity and indig|nation in her countenance&mdash;&s;he &s;tretched forth her right arm, and with a voice which was &s;weeter than melody it&s;elf, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed them in the following language: <Q>Ye children of men, li&s;ten for a while to the voice of in&s;truction. Ye &s;eek health where it is not to be found. The boa&s;ted &s;pecifics you have been u&s;ing, have no virtues. Even the per&s;ons who gave them, labour under many of the di&s;or|ders they attempt to cure. My name is HYGIAEA. I pre|&s;ide over the health of mankind. De&s;card all your me|dicines, and &s;eek relief from Temperance and EXERCISE alone. Every thing you &s;ee is active around you. All the brute animals in nature are active in their in&s;tinctive pur|&s;uits. Inanimate nature is active too&mdash;air&mdash;fire&mdash;and water are always in motion. Unle&s;s this were the ca&s;e, they would &s;oon be unfit for the purpo&s;es they were de&s;igned, to &s;erve in the oeconomy of nature. Shun &s;loth. This unhinges all the &s;prings of life&mdash;fly from your di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;they will not&mdash; they cannot pur&s;ue you.</Q> Here &s;he ended&mdash;&s;he dropped the parchment upon the earth&mdash;a cloud received her, and &s;he immediately a&s;cended, and di&s;appeared from their &s;ight&mdash;a &s;ilence en&s;ued&mdash;more expre&s;&s;ive of approbation, than the loud|e&s;t peals of applau&s;e. One of them approached with reve|rence to the &s;pot where &s;he &s;tood&mdash;took up the &s;croll, and read the contents of it to his companions. It contained di|rections to each of them, what they &s;hould do to re&s;tore their health. They all prepared them&s;elves to obey the advice of the heavenly vi&s;ion. The gouty man broke his vial of elixir,
<PB N="44" REF="012547_0043_0F8ADB5905B92A08">
threw his powders into the fire, and walked four or five miles every day before breakfa&s;t. The man afflicted with the gra|vel threw a&s;ide his drops, and began to work in his garden, or to play two or three hours every day at bowles. The hi|pochondriac and hy&s;teric patients di&s;charged their boxes of a&s;|&s;afoetida, and took a journey on hor&s;eback, to di&s;tant and op|po&s;ite ends of the i&s;land. The melancholic threw a&s;ide his gloomy &s;y&s;tems of philo&s;ophy, and &s;ent for a dancing ma&s;ter. The &s;tudious man &s;hut up his folios, and &s;ought amu&s;ement from the &s;ports of children. The leper threw away his mer|curial pills, and &s;wam every day in a neighbouring river. The con&s;umptive man threw his bal&s;am out of his window, and took a voyage to a di&s;tant country. After &s;ome months, they all returned to the place they were wont to a&s;&s;emble in. Joy appeared in each of their countenances. One had renewed his youth&mdash;another had recovered the u&s;e of his limbs&mdash;a third, who had been half bent for many years, now walked upright&mdash;a fourth began to &s;ing &s;ome jovial &s;ong, without be|ing a&s;ked&mdash;a fifth could talk for hours together, without be|ing interrupted with a cough&mdash;in a word, they all enjoyed now a complete recovery of their health. They joined in offering &s;acrifices to Hygiaea. Temples were erected to her memory; and &s;he continues, to this day, to be wor&s;hipped by all the inhabitants of that i&s;land.</P>
