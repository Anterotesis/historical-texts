<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 4. John to the &s;even Churches which are in A&s;ia.</P>
<P>This is the Super&s;cription of his Book by intimating to whom he directs it to;</P>
<P>Grace be unto you, and peace from him which is, and which was, and which is to come.</P>
<P>Thus he Salutes them in that grace and mercy which they were made partakers of from God the Father under the&s;e terms, to wit, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> Why doth John declare God the Father in the&s;e terms?</P>

<HI>An&s;w.</HI> He expre&s;&s;eth it as in the vi&s;ion he &s;aw it before the throne of God, as it appears in the 4th Chap. of this book, 5th Ver&s;e. <HI>And there was &s;even lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the &s;even &s;pirits of God;</HI> thus John followeth the Vi&s;ion and writeth things as they were revealed to him, calling the holy Spirit of God as he &s;aw it, by the number SEVEN, tho' it be but one eternal Spirit in it &s;elf; yet as it is di&s;tributed by mea&s;ure to &s;even Churches, it bears the name Seven. But I purpo&s;e to &s;peak more fully to this in the fol|lowing part of the Chapter, when I come to &s;peak of the &s;e|ven Stars, and the &s;even golden Candle-&s;ticks.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 5. And from Je&s;us Chri&s;t who is the faith|ful witne&s;s, and the fir&s;t begotten of the dead, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that grace and mercy was extended from the&s;e Three to the &s;even Churches, <HI>to wit,</HI> from God the Fa|ther, and from the Spirit, and from Je&s;us Chri&s;t the &s;on of the Father, who is the faithful witne&s;s of the&s;e things contained in this book of the revelation; and the fir&s;t begotten of the dead to life again, by the re&s;urrection of his body which was crucified on the cro&s;s: And tho' the&s;e are three di&s;coveries of God, yet they are in union but one God. And this Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Prince of the Kings of the earth, who hath lo|ved us and wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his own Blood, this is to be under&s;tood through the &s;anctification of the Spirit which purifies the heart and inward parts of a &s;inner, according to <HI>David</HI>'s words, <HI>Wa&s;h me and I &s;hall be whiter than &s;now.</HI> P&s;al. 51.7.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 6. And hath made us Kings and Prie&s;ts unto God and his Father, to him be glory and do|minion for ever and ever, Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 7. Behold he cometh with clouds, and e|very eye &s;hall &s;ee him, and they al&s;o which pier|ced him, and all the kindreds of the earth &s;hall wail becau&s;e of him, even &s;o, Amen.</P>

Yea he is both God and man, as appears Rom. 9.5. <HI>And of whom as concerning the fle&s;h Chri&s;t came, who is over all God ble&s;&s;ed forever. Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 9. I John, who al&s;o am your brother and companion in tribulation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This is an evidence that God's faithful children (while in this world) are companions with John in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and John's patience is a pre&s;ident for us who are in the kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and in this trouble&s;ome world, to be patient in tribulation, that thereby we may gain experience.</P>
<P>I was <HI>(&s;aith he)</HI> in the I&s;le that is called Patmos.</P>
<P>Here he gives us an account where he was when he had this vi&s;ion revealed to him, it was upon an I&s;land, no doubt but where he was retire for the word of God, and for the te&s;|timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Here it appears that this book of the Revelation is a record of the word of God, and of the te&s;|timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to his &s;ervant John.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 10. I was in the &s;pirit on the Lords day.</P>
<P>This was the Lords day of the Revelation of the things contained in this Book, and John was the per&s;on that was to tarry till Chri&s;t did come and make them known to him, as appears by what the Lord Je&s;us hinted to Peter long before the time was come, even when he gave Peter that &s;olemn charge to feed his lambs &amp; &s;heep, bidding Peter follow him; upon which charge given to Peter, and Peter &s;eeing John following, he queries of Je&s;us concerning John, what was for him to do, as is to be &s;een, Joh. 21.20. &amp;c. <HI>Then Peter turning about, &s;eeth the di&s;ciple whom Je&s;us loved following; Peter &s;eeing him, &s;aith to Je&s;us, Lord, and what &s;hall this man do? Je&s;us &s;aith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee, follow thou me: Then went this &s;aying abroad among the bre|thren, that this di&s;ciple &s;hould not die; yet Je&s;us &s;aid not unto him, no &s;hall not die, but if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee.</HI> From hence we may ob&s;erve that the Lord Je&s;us hinted to Peter that he had a work al&s;o for his &s;ervant John to do, tho' then not under&s;tood by the brethren who thought he &s;hould not die, but now the Lords day of the Re|velation of what is contained in this book is come, for John
<PB N="5" REF="002172_0004_0FBC79F34171CFE0">hath now tarried till the Lord is come, as appears, in the 18th and 19th ver&s;es, <HI>I am he that liveth and was dead, &amp;c. Write the things which thou ha&s;t &s;een, and the things which are, and the things which &s;hall be hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>Some have groundle&s;ly and &s;cripturele&s;ly imagined this re|velation to be on a fir&s;t day of the Week, but &s;eeing no &s;uch thing is revealed in the book, neither is it a material thing to the opening of the hi&s;tory it &s;elf, it is altogether fruitle&s;s; for rea&s;on it &s;elf will tell us, that it contained &s;ome con&s;idera|ble time more than one day, for John wrote tho&s;e vi&s;ions as he &s;aw and heard them, as throughout the book it &s;elf appears; as for in&s;tance, Chap. 10.4. <HI>And when the &s;even thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from heaven, &s;aying to me, &s;eal up tho&s;e things which the &s;even thunders uttered, and write them not.</HI> Thus the Lords day of revelations and vi&s;ions which John &s;aw, continued till he had accompli&s;hed the writing of them.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 11. Saying I am Alpha and Omega, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t, and, What thou &s;ee&s;t write in a book, and &s;end it to the &s;even churches which are in A&s;ia, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This is the voice of the Authority of the Maje&s;ty of God, requiring and commanding John to write in a Book this vi&s;i|on which &s;hould be &s;et before his eyes, and to &s;end it to the afore&s;aid Churches.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 12. And I turned to &s;ee the voice that &s;pake with me.</P>
<P>This great voice &s;peaking behind the Apo&s;tle cau&s;ed him to turn about,</P>
<P>And being turned, I &s;aw &s;even golden candle|&s;ticks;</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;even golden candle&s;ticks, repre&s;ented to him the &s;even churches of A&s;ia, to whom he was to write to. Now the rea&s;on why they are repre&s;ented to him by candle&s;ticks, is, becau&s;e candle&s;ticks hold up the light, to give light to all that are in the hou&s;e, and God's Church are the light of the world, Mat. 5.14, 15. <HI>Ye are the light of the world; a city that is &s;et on a hill cannot be hid, neither do men light a candle

And this number &s;even in this book is my&s;tical, and comprehends the whole of every thing it mea&s;ures: As for in&s;tance, the &s;even golden can|dle&s;ticks which is the &s;even churches, comprehends all the churches of Chri&s;t in the world; and the &s;even &s;tars compre|hends not only the &s;even angels or mini&s;ters of the &s;even churches of A&s;ia, but all the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t's churches throughout the whole world. And the &s;even &s;pirits of God, tho' it is but one &s;pirit in its &s;elf, and is unmea&s;urable, yet it being given by mea&s;ure to the &s;even churches, it bears the name &s;even, to comprehend the full di&s;tribution of it be&s;towe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on all churches</P>

This Vi&s;ion which John &s;aw like the Son of man in the mid&s;t of the &s;even golden candle&s;ticks, is a repre&s;entation of the divine pre&s;ence of God with his Churches, in union with his beloved Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>who&s;e delight is to be with the &s;ons of men,</HI> Prov. 8.31. 2 Cor. 6.16. <HI>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and will be their God, and they &s;hall be my people.</HI> And whereas he &s;aw him clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden gir|dle of &s;trength and truth, as is written of him.

<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 14. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as &s;now.</P>
<P>Thus John &s;aw him in the vi&s;ion, as he is the Ancient of days, the father and creator of all things, the whitene&s;s of his hair was to &s;et forth his fatherly age, according to the vi&s;ion of Daniel, 7.9. <HI>The hair of his head was like the pure wooll,</HI> And in this place it is &s;aid to be as white as &s;now, which is to &s;et forth his grave, fatherly Maje&s;ty in the Per&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And his eyes were as a flame of fire;</P>
<P>Quick to di&s;cern all Things, the &s;ight of who&s;e eyes pierceth through all things, Heb. 4.13. <HI>Neither is their any creature that is not manife&s;t in his &s;ight, but all things are naked and o|pen unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 15. And his feet like unto fine bra&s;s as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the &s;ound of many waters.</P>
<P>Thus did John in the vi&s;ion behold the terrible Maje&s;ty of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who treads all his enemies under his feet, as was &s;hewed to John in Chap. 10.2. <HI>And he &s;et his right foot on the &s;ea, and his left foot on the earth.</HI> And his voice was mo&s;t terrible even as the &s;ound of many wa|ters: P&s;al. 93.4. <HI>The Lord on high is mightier thon the noi&s;e of many waters, yea, than the waves of the Sea.</HI></P>

<P>This is to repre&s;ent the word of his power, to &s;hew how terrible that Sentence is that proceeds out of his mouth, even as a &s;harp two edged Sword, to execute judgment upon his enemies.

<P>His countenance was as the &s;un &s;hining in his &s;trength.</P>

<P>Thus glorious and terrible was the Maje&s;ty of the Lord Je&s;us, too terrible for John to behold, who fell at his feet as dead; but the Lord Je&s;us laid his right hand upon him, &s;peaking comfortably to him, <HI>&s;aying fear not, I am the fir&s;t and the last,</HI> &s;aith he: He is the fir&s;t in his divine Nature, for he is the everla&s;ting Father before all things; but in his humane nature he is the &s;eed and offspring of David, and cal|led the la&s;t Adam, 1 Cor. 15.45. <HI>The last Adam was made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> quickning Spirit.</HI></P>

Here are &s;everal things to be ob&s;erved from this ver&s;e: The fir&s;t is God's promi&s;e to give power to his two witne&s;&s;es, to prophecy; and &s;econdly, What are we to under&s;tand by prophecy? I an&s;wer, it is the gift of God, as in the foregoing words, I will give power unto my two witne&s;&s;es, or I will give unto my two witne&s;&s;es, and they &s;hall prophecy. So that it appears, none can prophecy but by the gift of God, that is, by the gift of his &s;pirit, for prophecy comes by the revelation of God's &s;pirit; <HI>for no man can &s;ay that Je&s;us is the Lord but by the holy Gho&s;t,</HI> 1 Cor. 12.3. for it is the &s;pirit of God that reveals him to us to be the Lord; <HI>for the testimony of Je&s;us is the &s;pirit of pro|phecy,</HI> Chap. 19.10. And thirdly, the time here &s;poken of their prophecy, is a thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty days, which time, reckoning thirty days to a month, makes ju&s;t forty and two months, which mea&s;ures the &s;ame time that the Gentiles tread the holy city under foot, &s;poken of in the foregoing ver&s;e; for the time of the&s;e witne&s;&s;es pro|phecy is mea&s;ured by the day which is ruled by the &s;un, becau&s;e they are children of light and of the day; but the Gentiles are children of the night and of darkne&s;s, and their time is mea&s;ured by months or moons. And the fourth thing is their &s;ad and mournful &s;tate in the time of this prophecy, which is &s;ignified by their being <HI>cloathed in &s;ackcloth.</HI> And fifthly, let us inquire, Who the&s;e wit|ne&s;&s;es be, and why they are called two? Why they are called two, is &s;hewed in the fourth ver&s;e; the&s;e are the two olive trees, and the two candle&s;ticks &s;tanding before the God of the earth. The Church of Chri&s;t is called an olive tree under the fir&s;t te&s;tament, as plainly appears in <HI>Jer.</HI> 11. comparing the 15th ver&s;e with the 16th. <HI>What hath my beloved to do in mine hou&s;e, &s;eeing &s;he hath committed lewdne&s;s with many, &amp;c. The Lord called thy name a green olive tree, fair and of goodly fruit.</HI> Thus it appears the olive tree did figure the Church, as is to be &s;een al&s;o in Rom. 11.24. <HI>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is mild by nature, and wert graffed in contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more &s;hall the&s;e which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree.</HI> Thus both the Church of the Jews under the fir&s;t te&s;tament, and the Church of the Gentiles under the new te&s;tament,
<PB N="98" REF="002172_0051_0FBC7A51B8FB3820">are compared to an olive tree; &s;o that it appears evident|ly, that the Church of Chri&s;t is intended by &s;hore witne&s;&s;es not only by the two olive trees, but al&s;o by the two can|dle&s;ticks; for the Church of Chri&s;t under the old te ta|ment was repre&s;ented to Zechariah by a golden candle&s;tick, Zech 4.2. <HI>And he &s;aid unto me what &s;ee&s;t thou? And I &s;aid, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold.</HI> And al&s;o the &s;even Churches of A&s;ia were repre&s;ented to John by the &s;even golden candle&s;ticks, Chap. 1.20. <HI>The &s;even golden candle&s;ticks are the &s;even Churches.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears that the&s;e witne&s;&s;es are the Church of Chri&s;t; for the olive tree and the candle&s;tick figured no|thing el&s;e in the Scripture but the Church; &s;o that they are very plainly de&s;cribed to be the Church of Chri&s;t And &s;ixthly, why are they called two witne&s;&s;es? I an|&s;wer, in &s;everal re&s;pects; for under the law of Mo&s;es, two witne&s;&s;es or three was to e&s;tabli&s;h the matter, Deut. 19 15. <HI>At the mouth of two witne&s;&s;es, or at the mouth of three witne&s;&s;es &s;hall the matter be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</HI> And tho' the Church be many witne&s;&s;es, yet for &s;everal rea&s;ons they are expre&s;s'd by the number two, that being a &s;ufficient proof under the law; and for &s;everal other rea&s;ons as herein.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 4. The&s;e are the two olive trees and the two candle&s;ticks &s;tanding before the God of the earth.</P>
<P>They are called two olive trees and two candle&s;ticks &s;tanding before the God of the earth. They are two in re|&s;pect of the two natures in union. The oyl doth figure the Spirit of God which is divine; and the &s;tock and branches doth figure the humane nature of Chri&s;t, and his Church: And thus in their te&s;timony they are two joint witne&s;&s;es in every thing they witne&s;s to; and therefore their witne&s;s is called a prophecy; as for in&s;tance, Rom. 8.16. <HI>The &s;pirit it &s;elf in us is one, and its bearing witne&s;s with our &s;pirit, makes two joint witne&s;&s;es,</HI> to confirm to us that we are the children of God. And it is &s;aid they are two prophets and the two candle&s;ticks, in re&s;pect of the two re&s;taments they did te&s;tify under, mea&s;uring the Church of the Jews under the fir&s;t te&s;tament to be one olive tree, and
<PB N="99" REF="002172_0051_0FBC7A51B8FB3820">one candle&s;tick; and the Church under the new te&s;tament to be the other olive tree and candle&s;tick, which makes two live trees and two candle&s;ticks, &s;tanding before the God of the earth, Zech. 4.2. <HI>I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of Gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his &s;even lamps thereon, and &s;even pipes to the &s;even lamps.</HI> This candle&s;tick with the &s;even lamps upon it, did repre|pre&s;ent the Church under the old te&s;tament: Compare this with the 11th and 12th ver&s;es, <HI>What are the&s;e two olive trees upon the right &s;ide of the candlestick, and upon the left &s;ide thereof? And I an&s;wered again and &s;aid unto him, What he the&s;e two olive branches, which thro' the two golden pipes empty the golden oyl out of them&s;elves.</HI> Ver&s;e 14. <HI>Then &s;aid he, the&s;e are the two anointed ones, that stand by the God of the whole earth.</HI> And the&s;e two anointed ones that &s;tood before the God of the whole earth, was Zerubbabel the Governour, and Jo&s;hua the high Prie&s;t, who were types of Chri&s;t, and were two witne&s;&s;es under that mini&s;tration, who &s;tood before the God of the whole earth, and did repre&s;ent that union that is between Chri&s;t and his Church, they being compared to two olive trees, and two branches, which thro' the two golden pipes empty the golden oyl out of them&s;elves; that is, they were feeders and nouri&s;hers of the Church, and types of Chri&s;t, who is the chief and great Shepherd, the one of his kingly office, the other of his prie&s;tly office; but the two anointed ones in the my &s;te|ry that &s;tands before the God of the earth, is Chri&s;t and his Church, who are the two anointed ones. Heb. 1.9. <HI>Therefore God, even thy God, hath amo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nted thee with the oyl of gladne&s;s above thy fellows.</HI> 2 Cor. 1 21. <HI>Now he which &s;ta|bli&s;hed us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God.</HI> Thus Chri&s;t and his Church are the two anointed ones, and the two witne&s;&s;es which &s;tand before the God of the earth.</P>
<P>But the Church under the old te&s;tament was called but one candle&s;tick: the u&s;e of the candle&s;tick is to hold the light; and the candle&s;tick that holds the &s;even lamps, if there be no oyl they can give no light, therefore the olive tree that yields the oyle &s;tanding by the candle&s;tick, which candle&s;tick holds up the &s;even lamps, which hath &s;even
<PB N="100" REF="002172_0052_0FBC7A5377ABC138">pipes to feed the &s;even lamps; thus it cau&s;eth the lamps to give a continual light; thus the my&s;tery of the two natures of Chri&s;t is held forth by this figure: The can|dle&s;tick with its &s;even lamps holds forth the Church; and the olive tree holds forth Chri&s;t's humane nature with his Church, and the golden oyl his divine nature; &s;o that as the oyl that flows from the olive tree, and feeds the lamps, and cau&s;eth them to give a continual light; &s;o the Spirit of Chri&s;t that flows from him&s;elf into his Church, or members, feed and nouri&s;h them, &s;o that they become the light of the world: So that Je&s;us Chri&s;t the true olive tree, and his Church in union with him, are the two witne&s;&s;es that always &s;tand before the God of the earth, and bear witne&s;s to the truth: Thus the Spirit and the Bride are cal|led two olive trees, and two candle&s;ticks, becau&s;e under two mini&s;trations, to wit, under the old te&s;tament and under the new: And thus they &s;tand before the God of the earth, and are the light of the world, bearing witne&s;s to the truth which is revealed in them by the Spirit of truth; and therefore their witne&s;s is by prophecy, &s;o that Chri&s;t and his Church thus in union are called two prophets, and two witne&s;&s;es; Joh. 18.37. <HI>For this end was I born, and for this cau&s;e came I into the world, that I &s;hould bear witne&s;s unto the truth.</HI> Chap. 1.5. <HI>And from Je&s;us Chri&s;t who is the faithful witne&s;s.</HI> Acts 1.8. <HI>But ye &s;hall receive power after that the Holy Gho&s;t is come upon you; and ye &s;hall be witne&s;&s;es unto me, both in Jeru&s;alem and in Judea, and in Sa|maria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth.</HI> Thus God gives power unto his witne&s;&s;es; as al&s;o in Acts 5.32. <HI>And we are his witne&s;&s;es of the&s;e things, and &s;o is al&s;o the holy Gho&s;t whom God hath given to them that obey him:</HI> Here are the two witne&s;&s;es &s;poken of in union, to wit, they with the holy Gho&s;t which is in them; for the witne&s;s of the holy Gho&s;t which is in them, is the witne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t with his Church; and that which they witne&s;s to is that which God hath revealed to them by his Spirit, &s;o that their te&s;timony is by the Spirit of prophecy, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 2.20. compared with the <HI>26th and 27th ver&s;es,</HI> bearing wit|ne&s;s to the truth, again&s;t all fal&s;e wor&s;hip &s;et up in the world by the in&s;titution, laws and appointments of men,

<P>ANd I &s;tood upon the &s;and of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Thus it appeared unto John in his vi&s;ion, as if he &s;tood on the &s;and of the &s;ea; &s;o that he had a fair pro&s;pect to behold the face of the waters.</P>
<P>And I &s;aw a bea&s;t ri&s;e out of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>This bea&s;t is the kingdoms of this world, and more par|ticularly the Roman kingdom, who had rule at that time. And by the waters is meant <HI>peoples and multitudes, and nations and tongues,</HI> as appears Chap. 17.15. <HI>Jer.</HI> 51.53. And by the <HI>heads of the boa&s;t</HI> is meant the dominion of this world: And the number <HI>&s;even</HI> mea&s;ures the whole dominion or government of this world: And the <HI>ten horns</HI> is to expre&s;s many kingly powers that ari&s;eth out of the &s;even heads; for it is &s;aid in Chap. 17.9, 10. <HI>The &s;even heads are &s;even mountains, and the &s;even mountains</HI> repre&s;ent all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dominion and dignity of this world: And there are &s;even kings, and the &s;even kings mea&s;ures all the vi&s;ible domi|nion of this world; and in the 12th ver&s;e of the 17th Chapter it is &s;aid, <HI>the ten horns are ten kings,</HI> that is, there are many kings that ari&s;eth out of the &s;even heak, and where a king is there is power; for whereas it is &s;aid, <HI>and upon his horns ten crowns,</HI> which is to &s;hew the ten kings or horns are crown'd with power. <HI>And upon his heads the names of bla&s;phemy;</HI> and this was to &s;hew that the powers of this world in heatheni&s;m and antichri&s;ti|ani&s;m, hath been wont to <HI>reproach both God and his taber|nacle,</HI> or Church, as in the 6th ver&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="002172_0067_0FBC7A75058D14E0">
<HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 2. And the bea&s;t which I &s;aw was like a leopard, and his feet as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion.</P>
<P>Thus God repre&s;ents the kingly powers of this world by the mo&s;t fierce&s;t wild bea&s;ts, who are fierce and &s;trong, and able thereby to de&s;troy and overcome the bea&s;ts of the earth. And the Prophet Daniel Chap. 7. &s;aw the like vi&s;ion of the four Monarchs, repre&s;ented to him by the like fierce bea&s;ts; but Daniel prophecied in the fir&s;t Monarch, and John in the time of the la&s;t. Now the&s;e kings and powers were &s;et up by God to do ju&s;tice and judgment among the inha|bitants of the earth. And this bea&s;t here &s;poken of is not yet repre&s;ented to John of a &s;carlet colour, becau&s;e its power is of God, according to Paul's te&s;timony, Rom. 13.1, &amp;c. <HI>Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject to the higher powers; for there is no power but of God, the powers that are ordained of God.</HI> This Apo&s;tle is &s;peaking of the &s;ame power that John is prophecying of, to wit, the Roman kingdom then ruling.</P>
<P>And the dragon gave him his power, and his &s;eat, and great authority.</P>
<P>The bea&s;t receiving his power from the dragon, and ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ci&s;ing it, becomes a &s;carlet coloured bea&s;t, as doth appear in Chap. 17.3. for we read of this dragon and his power in Chap. 12.3. <HI>And behold a great red dragon, having &s;even heads and ten horns, and &s;even crowns on his heads.</HI> This dragon is that old &s;erpent called the devil and &s;atan, <HI>Chap.</HI> 12.9. Yea, he is the God of this world, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.4. <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.30. And was a murderer from the beginning, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.44. and therefore may well be called the <HI>red dragon.</HI> This dragon offered to give to our Saviour all his dominion and glory here &s;poken of, upon condition that he would <HI>fall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ewn and wor&s;hip him,</HI> Luk. 4.5, 6, 7. but he refu&s;eth to purcha&s;e it upon tho&s;e terms; but the bea&s;t <HI>receiveth it</HI> of him: And the dragon thus giving to the bea&s;t <HI>his power, and his &s;eat, and great authority,</HI> he now becomes a per&s;ecuting power, by this power derived from the dragon, and there|by e&s;tabli&s;heth fal&s;e wor&s;hip.</P>

<HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 3. And I &s;aw one of his heads as it were wounded to death.</P>
<P>This was one of the &s;even heads of the dragon which he gave to the bea&s;t; for that power which is derived from God is not to be wounded, but is to continue to the worlds end: Now if the dragon had not the dominion of this world, he could not be the god of it. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.4. And this wound was given him by the glorious light of the Go&s;pel, after the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, being &s;pread among the Gentiles, and by the &s;word of God put into the hand of Con&s;tantine, to the overthrow of that per&s;ecuting power, derived from the dragon, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the hand of the Romi&s;h heatheni&s;h power, who &s;tood to mai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tain the wor&s;hipping of idols, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;phemed God and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> under who&s;e power the ten fir&s;t per&s;ecutions was ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on.

<P>And his deadly wound was healed.</P>
<P>And the healing of this wound was by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lling away of the true Church, and by the ri&s;ing up of the fal&s;e, by which antichri&s;t got a head, and by this means the deadly wound was healed, for now the fal&s;e Church was taken for the true, and the true for the fal&s;e; and thus the dragons pow|er was revived and his head healed, and all the world wondred after the bea&s;t; for now all the world concluded it was a Chri&s;tian power that ruled, <HI>for the dragon d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|veth the whole world,</HI> Chap. 12.9.</P>

<P>This is to be under&s;tood thus: The power which the dragon gives the bea&s;t is given under pretennce of &s;etting up the true wor&s;hip of God, and requiring all people to attend it: The children of this world being in darkne&s;s, take the ordinances, in&s;titutions, doctrines and command|ments of men, to be the true wor&s;hip of God, Mat. 15.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>But in vain do they wor&s;hip me, teaching for doctrines the

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>We have had an account in the former part of this book, that after the great &s;preading of the Go&s;pel, that was by the Apo&s;tles of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors among the Gentiles, that there followed a very great apo&s;tacy and degene|rating from the truth, and a ri&s;ing of antichri&s;t and fal&s;e prophets, and over&s;preading the world; &s;o that by them the true Church was trodden under foot; and the fal&s;e taken for the true, and the true for the fal&s;e; &s;o that the true Church bath prophe&s;ied in a &s;ad and mournful &s;tate all this time of antichrists reign, even whil&s;t the fal&s;e Church hath been arayed in purple, and &s;carlet colour, and decked with gold, and precious &s;tone, and pearls; even all this time hath the true Church prophecyed in a mournful and &s;ad &s;tate, cloathed in &s;ackcloth, and trodden under foot by the fal&s;e Church: But it is certain, that the time is coming, that the fal&s;e Church &s;hall go into perdition and de&s;truction, and that the true Church &s;hall ari&s;e and &s;tand upon her feet,

<P>ANd I looked, and lo a Lamb &s;tood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred and forty and four thou&s;and, having his father<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> name written in their foreheads.</P>
<P>This lamb doth &s;et forth Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to be the redeem|er, or lamb of God which taketh away the &s;in of the world, and this company with him, doth repre&s;ent all his redeem|ed ones, as appears in Chap. 22.4. Chap. 9.4. And his &s;tanding on mount Sion with the hundred and forty &amp; four thou&s;and, is to &s;hew and &s;et forth their unmoveable &s;tand|ing; even on the mountain of God, it alluding from the mount upon which the city of David &s;tood, who was a type of Chri&s;t; and the Spirit of God in the Scripture doth &s;ometimes &s;et forth the unmoveable &s;tanding of &s;uch as &s;tand by faith, by expre&s;&s;ing their &s;tanding by this un|moveable mountain, as in P&s;al. 125.1. <HI>They that tru&s;t in the Lord &s;hall be as mount Sion which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever;</HI> and &s;o the author to the Hebrews, Heb. 12.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>But ye are come unto mount Sion, and to the city of the living God.</HI></P>
<P>Thus he &s;peaks becau&s;e they were come to God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> faith, and &s;o &s;tood upon the mountain of God's &s;trength being citizens of the heavenly Jeru&s;alem, which &s;tands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;piritual mount Sion; and the' here is a certain num|ber named, yet the&s;e do repre&s;ent all God's faithful &s;aints; and as we have an account in the former Chapter of the bea&s;ts va&s;&s;als, that had his mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, to &s;hew who&s;e they were, and whom they wor&s;hip, &s;o the&s;e have the lambs fathers name written i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their foreheads, to &s;how who&s;e they are, and whom the wor&s;hip.</P>

This book doth frequently allude from tho&s;e temporal figures under the fir&s;t te&s;tament, to expre&s;s &s;piritual things by which they figured, for they were not all I&s;rael that were of I&s;rael; &s;o that this number is expre&s;t to be tho&s;e that were &s;ealed in the &s;eventh Chap. of this book, ver&s;e 4. <HI>And I heard the number of them which were &s;ealed, &amp; there were &s;ealed a hun|dred and forty and four thou&s;and.</HI> This number doth mea|&s;ure the whole number of God's elect, &s;tanding on mount Sion with the lamb, being &s;ealed in their foreheads, or his fathers name written there, to &s;hew who&s;e they are, and whom they wor&s;hip, &s;tanding on the mount of God Al|mighty; but the fal&s;e Church &s;tandeth on the &s;even moun|tains or dominion of this world, Chap. 17.9. <HI>The &s;even heads are &s;even mountains on which the woman &s;itteth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 2. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.</P>
<P>This is to &s;et forth the prai&s;es of this heavenly ho&s;t, prai&s;ing God with innumerable voices, like the noi&s;e of many waters, and as the voice of great thunder. This is to &s;et forth their great joy and con&s;olation after their great &s;ufferings, who now &s;hine forth in the world as lights, tho' they had been long trod under foot of the Gentiles.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 3. And they &s;ung as it were a new &s;ong before the throne; and before the four bea&s;ts and the elders, and no man could learn that &s;ong but the hundred and forty and four thou&s;and, which were redeemed from the earth.</P>
<P>This new &s;ong was the &s;ong of victory, they having ob|tained deliverance from the power of their enemies. And now &s;tanding on mount Sion with the Lamb of God, and being &s;eal'd with his holy Spirit, they thus &s;ing before his throne, and before the four bea&s;ts, or holy Angels, and the elders which are twenty four in number, who&s;e names may

This is to be under&s;tood by the precious blood of the Lamb, which &s;tandeth with them on mount Sion; &s;ee it is the &s;ong of their redemption from &s;in, and from the wrath of God, and from the power of their per&s;ecut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and therefore not to be learned by any out of that &s;tate, which they are in.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 4. The&s;e are they which are not de|filed with women, for they are virgins.</P>
<P>Yea, &s;uch as are fit to be e&s;pou&s;ed to Chri&s;t, for they have not defiled them&s;elves with whoredom with the bea&s;t, but have kept their virginity.</P>
<P>And follow the Lamb whither&s;oever he go|eth.</P>
<P>For they are his redeemed ones, being redeemed from among men by his precious blood from their vain conver|&s;ation; and the&s;e being tho&s;e that fir&s;t &s;eparated from wor|&s;hiping the bea&s;t and his image, and it being upon the ri&s;ing &amp; &s;tanding up of the true Church, after &s;o long a time of apo&s;tacy, they are &s;aid to be the <HI>fir&s;t fruit unto God, and to the Lamb.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 5. And in their mouth was found no guile, for they are without fault before the throne of God,</P>
<P>Thus it appears that in their mouth was found no guile, that is, no hypocritical paryers, by flattery pretending to honour God with their mouth and lips, as hypocrites do when their heart is far from God.

<P>This fore part of the Chapter now gone through, &s;peaks particularly of a vi&s;ion that John had of the appearing of the Lamb of God, and his company, and &s;tanding upon the mount Sion; the&s;e are the two witne&s;&s;es which &s;tand before the God of the earth, and two prophets, and is

<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 6. And I &s;aw another Angel flie in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nid&s;t of heaven, having the everla&s;ting Go&s;|pel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth.</P>
<P>He calls this another angel, in re&s;pect that it repre|&s;ents the fir&s;t preaching of the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, after &s;o long a time of apo&s;tacy, and upon the true Churches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir&s;t ri&s;ing and coming out of her wilderne&s;s &s;trate; for before this time, even in the time of the fal&s;e Churches glory, there was only fal&s;e and fruitle&s;s doctrine preach'd, by the bea&s;t that came out of the earth with two horns like a lamb, which did repre&s;ent the ri&s;ing up of the fal&s;e pro|phets. But now there did appear mini&s;ters that did preach the go&s;pel of God openly, as by the vi&s;ion is held forth, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ying in the midst of heaven,</HI> that is, by open, publick pro|clamation, as &s;aith Chri&s;t, Mat. 10.27. <HI>And what ye hear in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that preach ye upon the hou&s;e tops.</HI> The vi&s;ion of this An|gel preaching the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, unto them that dwell on the earth, <HI>and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,</HI> doth hold forth, that as there was a time when the dragon did deceive the whole world, by bringing them to wor&s;hip the image of the bea&s;t, even all both &s;mall and great, rich and poor, free and bond; &s;o now the time is come, that the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel is now begun to be preached to all nations, and the my&s;tery of iniquity is now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> di&s;covery, and by preaching the go&s;pel to them that dwell on the earth, is meant to earthly men, even to &s;uch as wor&s;hip the bea&s;t and his image. This was in the time of the fir&s;t reformers.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 7. Saying with a loud voice, fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come, and wor&s;hip him that made heaven and earth, and the &s;ea, and the fountains of waters.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="002172_0077_0FBC7A87DA988090">
This ver&s;e contains the matter of the Go&s;pel which &s;aid Angel did preach, &s;aying with a loud voice to the wor|&s;hipers of the bea&s;t and his image, fear God and give glo|ry to him; &s;ignifying to them, that the hour of his judg|ment is come, and therefore exhorts them to wor&s;hip him that made heaven and earth, and the &s;ea, and the fountains of waters.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 8. And there followed another Angel &s;aying, Babylon is fallen is fallen, that great city, becau&s;e &s;he made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</P>
<P>This ver&s;e is to &s;hew what followed the preach|ing of the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, to wit, the fall of Babylon; and by Babylon's fall we are not to under&s;tand any vi&s;ible city to fall, but the fal&s;e Church; for her &s;ituation is among all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, where the go&s;pel was preached, as in the foregoing ver&s;e. To every nation, kindred and tongue; for as the name of the true Church of Chri&s;t is derived from Jeru&s;alem where the temple and alta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was erected; &s;o the fal&s;e Churches name is derived from old Babylon, who took Jeru&s;alem and led them into Capti|vity; &s;o that both the true Church &amp; the fal&s;e bear the name of a woman, and a city, but it is the members of each Church that is intended. And the rea&s;on of her fall is ren|dred, becau&s;e &s;he made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. By the wine of her fornication which &s;he made all nations to drink of, is intended her begui|ling them by her fal&s;e wor&s;hip, they drinking in her fal&s;e doctrine, and &s;o joining in with her fornication. And thus by her enticing allurements to her fal&s;e wor&s;hip, brought all nations under the wrath of God; for both the king<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the inhabitants of the earth have been alway wont to be deceived by the fal&s;e Church; and &s;o to join in with her in her fornication, as appears Chap. 17.2. <HI>With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="002172_0077_0FBC7A87DA988090">

<P>From hence we may note, how God threatens his &s;evere judgments with a loud voice, &s;ince his Church begins to ari&s;e and &s;tand upon her feet, &s;aying, <HI>If any man wor&s;hip the bea&s;t and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, the &s;ame &s;hall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the Cup of his indignation; and he &s;hall be tormented with fire and brim&s;tone, in the pre&s;ence of his holy Angels, and in the pre&s;ence of the Lamb.</HI> This is to expre&s;s his fiery anger again&s;t them, and to &s;et forth their perpetual tor|ment, in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e holy angeis and of that Lamb which we before read of &s;tanding on mount Sion; and he expre&s;&s;eth their torment to be as if it were with burning fire and brim&s;tone.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 11. And the &s;moke of their torment a&s;cendeth up for ever and ever; and they have no re&s;t day nor night who wor&s;hip the bea&s;t and his image, and who&s;oever receiveth the mark of his name.</P>
<P>Thus God makes open proclamation beforehand, of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ternal puni&s;hment which he hath before determined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">flict upon fal&s;e wor&s;hipers to all eternity; &s;o that they &s;hall have no re&s;t day nor night, for the &s;moke of their tor|ment a&s;cendeth up for ever &amp; ever, &s;aith he.

<P>And double unto her double, according to her works, in the cup which &s;he hath filled, fill to her double.</P>
<P>This is &s;poken of the cup of her fury of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, which &s;he filled and made the &s;aints to drink of; but now that they &s;hall fill the cup double to her, that is, give her a double reward.</P>

And after this we read of a &s;tar that fell from heaven, which the third trumpet gave notice of, and it fell upon the third part of the ri|vers, and upon the fountains of waters, and &s;o imbittered them, that many men died of the waters, becau&s;e they were made bitter; this was by drinking in corrupt doctrine, which this falling &s;tar brought into the Church, by rea|&s;on of which many in the Church decayed and dyed from that &s;piritual life which before they lived in, when they were nouri&s;hed with living fountains of water, which was good and whole&s;om doctrine.

<P>Thus the angel &s;hewed John this pure river of water of life which proceeded from the throne of God, and of the lamb, which is in the mid&s;t of the &s;treet of this city.

<P>Here is two things to be ob&s;erved from this ver&s;e: The fir&s;t is, the charge that the Angel gives John (when he had made known the&s;e things to John) not to &s;eal them, in the&s;e words, &s;aying, Seal not the &s;ayings of the prophecy of this book. Thus it appears, that John was required to di&s;|clo&s;e the&s;e things upon his knowledge of them. And the &s;econd thing is, the rea&s;on which is given him why he &s;hould not &s;eal them, for &s;aith the Angel, The time is at hand. Thus it appears, that John was required forth with to make publication of them upon the con&s;ideration that the time was at hand; &s;o that the &s;even churches of A&s;ia, to whom they did concern, might be warned to prepare them&s;elves for tho&s;e things which were then at hand.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 11. He that is unju&s;t let him be unju&s;t &s;till, and he which is filthy let him be filthy &s;till, and he that is righteous let him be righteous &s;till, and he that is holy let him be holy &s;till.</P>
<P>By the following ver&s;e the rea&s;on will be &s;een why the Angel &s;aith thus concerning the &s;tate of the unju&s;t and un|holy, and concerning the &s;tate of the righteous and holy.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 12. And behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man ac|cording as his work &s;hall be.</P>
<P>And behold I come quickly, &s;aith the Lord. Here he gives warning of his &s;peedy coming, to the unju&s;t, and to the filthy, and to the righteous, and to the holy; and that he will bring his reward with him to give unto every one
<PB N="258" REF="002172_0131_0FBC7AFC20BEEF40">of them according as his work &s;hall be. And thus at his coming, he will reward the unju&s;t and unholy according as their work &s;hall be: And to the righ|teous and holy according to their work. This coming quickly is in judgment to the wicked, &amp; with a good reward to the righteous; &s;o that the Lord here &s;peaks unto the un|ju&s;t, after this manner, when I come with my reward, let him be unju&s;t &s;till, for the day of his grace is now pa&s;t, and &s;o let it be with the unholy, for he likewi&s;e hath outgone the day of his grace, and therefore if the unju&s;t and the fil|thy, will run the hazard of &s;uch an unju&s;t and filthy &s;tate, I will come quickly upon them with my reward; and this is to forewarn the unju&s;t and filthy of the great Hazard they &s;tand in, while in that hazardable &s;tate. And to encourage the righteous and holy &s;o to continue that they might not lo&s;e their reward. But to take this &s;aying in &s;hort it carries with it implicitly, as if the Lord &s;hould &s;ay to the unju&s;t &amp; filthy, to the righteous and holy, even to them all, Behold I come quickly to reward every one of you according to your work and as I find you, &s;o I will reward you, and &s;o you &s;hall ever remain, in that &s;tate I find you in at my coming; &s;o your reward &s;hall be, and in that &s;tate &s;hall you remain, that is, the unju&s;t under the reward of the unju&s;t, and the filthy under the reward of the filthy, and the righteous under the reward of the righteous, and the holy under the reward of the holy. And this coming quickly is &s;uch a coming as he foretold of to &s;everal of the churches of A&s;ia, Chap. 2.5.16. <HI>Repent or el&s;e I will come unto you quickly.</HI> 25. v. <HI>But that which ye have already hold fa&s;t till I come.</HI> chap. 3.3. <HI>If therefore thou &s;halt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief and thou &s;halt not know what hour I will come on thee.</HI> chap. 3.11. <HI>Behold I come quickly, hold that fa&s;t which thou ha&s;t.</HI> Mat. 24.50, 51. <HI>The Lord of that &s;ervant &s;hall come in a day, when he looketh not for him, and in a hour that he is not ware of, and &s;hall cut him a&s;under, and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites, there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth</HI> Matt. 25.6. <HI>And at midnight there was a crie made, behold the. bridegroom cometh.</HI></P>
