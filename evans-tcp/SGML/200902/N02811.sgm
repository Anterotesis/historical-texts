<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM XXVII. 10.</BIBL>
<Q>WHEN my Father and my Mother for&s;ake me, then the LORD will take me up.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Title of this P&s;alm informs us who was the in&s;pired Penman, <HI>King David:</HI> In it he encourageth him|&s;elf in the LORD under his ex|treme dangers from his Enemies, and e&s;pecially from <HI>Saul. v.</HI> 1. <HI>The Lord is my light,</HI> the author of my joy, <HI>and my &s;alvation, whom &s;hall I fear</HI> &mdash;: And al&s;o offers to GOD his earne&s;t reque&s;ts for help and &s;uccour, as in the ver&s;e before my Text. <HI>Hide not thy face far from me &mdash; leave me not</HI> &mdash;. And the&s;e words may be brought in as an argu|ment to enforce his Petition from the con&s;ide|ration of his pre&s;ent &s;tate, That of an <HI>Orphan,</HI> who &s;tood in great need of help; or for the en|couragement of his faith, to tru&s;t in that GOD with whom the Fatherle&s;s find Mercy.</P>
<P>In the words we have, 1. <HI>A &s;orrowful ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed, When my Father &mdash;. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> reads it, Becau&s;e my Father &mdash; &s;o it is an argument to enforce his Petition, that GOD would not leave him, nor for&s;ake him. <HI>Pi&s;cator</HI>

and <HI>Mollerus</HI> read it, Altho'&mdash;. Our reading is, When: and thus <HI>Calvin.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We have <HI>his relief under this &s;orrow,</HI> Then the <HI>LORD will take me up:</HI> Receive, or gather me. Now we don't read that <HI>David</HI>'s Parents did ever de&s;ert him, tho' we find them &s;o unable to help him, and &s;o unfit to attend his Marches, that <HI>David</HI> de&s;ires of the King of <HI>Moab,</HI> that they might be with him till he &s;hould know what GOD would do for him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22.3. Accordingly, &s;ome Expo&s;itors take the words as &s;ignifying all humane helps under the Name of Parents, <Q>by which we may under&s;tand all Councils and Helps for &s;afety.</Q> Or, as others &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>His Parents had depar|ted this life;</HI> in which &s;en&s;e I wou'd now con|&s;ider the words. However it was, <HI>David</HI> was now like an <HI>Orphan,</HI> in an helple&s;s condition as to humane views and means, and accordingly he by faith realizeth GOD's Parental care and love, who, as He is ever able to help His Peo|ple, &s;o hath the bowels of a Father yerning to|wards them under their di&s;tre&s;&s;es; yea, more than the compa&s;&s;ions of the tender Mother. <HI>Then the LORD,</HI> the Name given to GOD here is <HI>JEHOVAH,</HI> which &s;ignifies GOD's Eternal Self-exi&s;tence, and His giving Being to all Creatures. The fathers of our fle&s;h are Mortal, and mu&s;t in a little time for&s;ake us, if we are not taken from them fir&s;t; but GOD the Everla&s;ting Father lives for ever to take care of His People. <HI>Shall take me up,</HI> or ga|ther me.

<P>GOD alone can &s;ay to us and fulfil that His word, <HI>I will never leave thee, nor for&s;ake thee.</HI> Our choice&s;t friends here are, as we, frail, mortal Creatures. For what is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vani&s;heth away. <HI>Your Fathers where are they?</HI> &mdash; Zech. 1.5. They are no more in this World; they are gone to their long home, to the hou&s;e appointed for all living; and the Places which once knew them &s;hall know them no more. Accordingly, when the godly depart this life, they are &s;aid to be gather|ed to their People. Thus <HI>Abraham</HI> died in a good old Age, and <HI>was gathered to his Peo|ple,</HI> Gen. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.8. <Q>When the Saints die out of this World, they are born into the other.</Q> Their bodies indeed are left behind; however, the condition of the&s;e is &s;uch when the Spirits that animated them are gone, that we mu&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="003351_0006_0FF8176BA142ADD0">
bury them out of &s;ight. And as their bodies re&s;t in their Graves, &s;o their Spirits return to GOD who gave them. When they leave our Society on Earth they go to the heavenly Je|ru&s;alem, to the Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect, and to Je&s;us the Mediator of the new Covenant. Here a little to confirm &amp; illu&s;trate this Head, I may &s;ay, 1. All Men are &s;ubject to the law of Mortality, and mu&s;t be remov'd out of this World by Death. 2. According to the cour&s;e of Nature Parents for&s;ake their Children, and leave them behind in this World, when they depart out of it by Death.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>All Men are &s;ubject to the law of Mor|tality, and mu&s;t be remov'd out of this World by Death.</HI> There is a Statute of Heaven for it, Heb. 9.27. &mdash; <HI>It is appointed unto Men once to die</HI> &mdash;. Indeed the LORD of Life hath made, and will make exceptions to this general rule. Thus <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elijah</HI> under the old Te&s;tament, were tran&s;lated, that they &s;hould not &s;ee death. (And &s;urely it was a great favour of GOD to the departed Spirits of the Saints, &s;o early to give them an Example of the glo|rious beauty and perfection which their bodies &s;hould be advanced to at the Re&s;urrection <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Enoch</HI> was tran&s;lated, A. M. 987. <HI>B. U&s;uer.</HI></NOTE>.) And the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> informs us that the People of GOD, who &s;hall be found alive at our Saviour's coming to rai&s;e the dead, <HI>Shall not &s;leep,</HI> (i.e. die) <HI>but be changed,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.51, 52. How|ever this is the common lot. P&s;al. 89.48. <HI>What man is he that liveth, and &s;hall not &s;ee death?</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="003351_0007_0FF8176F30E28AA8">
No &s;ooner had Man &s;inn'd but Death had power over him, and began to work towards a di&s;&s;olu|tion of this earthly frame. Gen. 2.17. &mdash; <HI>In the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;hall &s;urely die.</HI> And it is plain from Scripture that this Threatning Extends to <HI>Adam's</HI> Po&s;terity: Rom. 5.12. <HI>Wherefore, as by one man &s;in entred into the World, and death by &s;in; and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned.</HI> Men are various ways di&s;tingui&s;h'd in the World into high and low, rich and poor, young and old, <HI>&amp;c;</HI> but in this re&s;pect they are all upon a level, equally &s;ubject to death. And this the Experience of all Ages teacheth. <HI>One Generation pa&s;&s;eth away, and another cometh;</HI> &mdash; Eccl. 1.4. Rom. 5.14. &mdash; <HI>Death reigned from Adam to Mo&s;es, even over them that had not &s;inn'd after the &s;imilitude of A|dam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion</HI>&mdash;. As <HI>infants</HI> who have not been guilty of Actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion com|mitted in their own per&s;ons, and yet the &s;en|tence of the law takes hold of them, an unde|diable evidence that <HI>Adam's</HI> fir&s;t &s;in is imputed to them; and that we all bring a corrupt Na|ture into the World with us. It is true, the Children of GOD are deliver'd from the &s;ting and cur&s;e of death by JESUS CHRIST, who by dying hath conquered this la&s;t Enemy; &s;o that they &s;hall all Triumph, and &s;ay, <HI>O death, where is thy &s;ling? O grave, where is thy victory?</HI> 1 Cor. 15.55. However, GOD will have them al&s;o ta&s;te of this bitter cup as a te&s;timony of His displea&s;ure again&s;t their &s;in, and as a means of purging away the remains of
<PB N="6" REF="003351_0008_0FF81771F55B5510">
it, that they may be pre&s;ented without &s;pot before Him. They mu&s;t pa&s;s thro' this <HI>Jor|dan</HI> before they obtain Re&s;t in the heavenly <HI>Canaan.</HI> Their Faith in JESUS CHRIST, and other Graces may help them to die well; but will not exempt them from the &s;troke of death: Heb. 11.13. <HI>The&s;e all died in faith</HI> &mdash;. They mu&s;t this way, thro' the valley of the &s;hadow of death, follow the Captain of their Salvation to Glory. They mu&s;t be bro't down to the du&s;t in order to their being exalted to &s;it with Him on Thrones in His Fathers King|dom. Their warfare is not accompli&s;hed till they have encountred this Enemy, nor can they &s;ay, It is fini&s;hed, until, with our Saviour, They give up the Gho&s;t. Thus died <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> the Ser|vant of the LORD. Thus <HI>David</HI> after he had &s;erved his generation according to the will of GOD, <HI>fell a &s;leep, &amp; was laid to his Fathers</HI> &mdash;. The matter of Fact which the Jews alledged was true, tho' mi&s;applied, Joh. 8.52. &mdash; <HI>Abra|ham is dead, and the Prophets</HI>&mdash;. Accordingly, when our Saviour a&s;&s;erts, <HI>If any man keep my &s;aying, he &s;hall never &s;ee death,</HI> v. 51. He mu&s;t be under&s;tood of the <HI>&s;econd death,</HI> which is eter|nal, comprehending the de&s;truction of Soul and Body in Hell. Now, by death we are remove'd out of this World, agreably death is call'd a departure, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 6. &mdash; The time of <HI>my de|parture</HI> is at hand. The Soul goeth forth out of the Body, the vital union between them be|ing di&s;&s;olvd'd. <HI>Gen.</HI> 35.18. &mdash; As her <HI>&s;oul was in departing, for &s;he died</HI> &mdash;. And the Body is then carried to the Grave, the Hou&s;e appointed
<PB N="7" REF="003351_0009_0FF81775165B7AF0">
for all the living. Death di&s;&s;olveth the Union, and breaks off the Society there was between the neare&s;t Relations; they are &s;eparated for|ever as to what concerns this life, which leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>According to the Cour&s;e of Nature Pa|rents for&s;ake their Children, and leave them behind in this World; when they depart out of it by death.</HI> Indeed, it is no uncommon thing to have this order of Nature inverted. We read that of old, <HI>Haran died before his Father Terah,</HI> i. e. "In his &s;ight and pre&s;ence, he being yet alive, <HI>Gen.</HI> 11. 28. Thus <HI>Aaron, Job, David,</HI> &amp;c. &s;urviv'd to bewail the lo&s;s of Children. And alas! how common is this in our day? Upon this account among others the land of darkne&s;s may be &s;aid to be <HI>without or|der,</HI> Job 10. 22. The young and &s;trong have the precedency oftentimes, and go to the Grave before the aged and infirm. The lamp of life is not &s;eldom blown out. Di&s;ea&s;es &amp; Accidents, as we call them, tho' all under the government of GOD's Providence, often put a period to lives which might endure much longer. We die &s;ooner or later according to the will of the Sovereign GOD, who hath determined our Days on Earth in His Decree, &amp; appointed our bounds which we cannot pa&s;s. Job 14.5. <HI>Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou ha&s;t appointed his bounds that he cannot pa&s;s.</HI> However, according to the cour&s;e of Nature, as Parents are born into the World fir&s;t, &s;o they die out of it before their Children. The decays of Nature
<PB N="8" REF="003351_0010_0FF817772E876468">
and infirmities of Age gradually grow upon them; we &s;ee them decline and wear away un|der the fatigues and burdens of life, until, as the Candle burns down and goeth out, &s;o the vital heat and moi&s;ture being con&s;um'd, they expire. P&s;al. 90.10. <HI>The days of our years are three&s;core years and ten; and if by rea&s;on of &s;trength they be four&s;core years, yet is their &s;trength labour and &s;orrow: for it is &s;oon cut off, and we fly away.</HI> This hath been accoun|ted the Age of Man &s;ince <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s time. Here al&s;o we may ob&s;erve, That it is no &s;trange thing for Parents to be taken away in their full &s;trength, yea, even before middle Age, and &s;o to leave their Children Young, &s;ometimes not ca|pable of under&s;tanding the greatne&s;s of their lo&s;s; but then, others by the favour of GOD continue till their Children are grown up, and after that they have for &s;ome time experienc'd the great benefit of their Pre&s;ence, Coun&s;els and Prayers, the Parents die and leave them to la|ment their lo&s;s. And the pious Parent may when leaving this World, &s;ay to &s;urvivours, &s;omething as our Saviour to the daughters of Jeru&s;alem; &mdash; <HI>Weep not for me, but for your &s;elves</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luck 23, 28.</NOTE>. For when &s;uch depart, they go to be with CHRIST, which is far better; they go out of a World of &s;in and &s;orrow to that better Country, which is an heavenly, where they are comforted in the glorious Pre&s;ence of the Lamb, having all tears wiped from their Eyes, and be|ing made perfect in holine&s;s. The Day of their

death is better to them than the day of their birth. But then, by &s;uch a bereaving Providence, GOD calls us to lament and mourn; for they are gone from us, and that not to return again to conver&s;e with us here. We &s;ee their faces no more; we behold their exemplary Conver|&s;ation no more, receive their In&s;tructions and help no more. And therefore &s;uch a Bereave|ment ought to be lamented, even tho' our Parents &s;hould live to a good old Age: When their hoary heads which were a Crown of Glory, being found in the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s, are laid in the du&s;t, We may well take up a lamentation, and &s;ay, the <HI>Crown is fallen &mdash; for the glo|ry of children are their fathers,</HI> Prov. 17.6.

GOD promi&s;ed <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 17.7. <HI>I will e&s;tabli&s;h my covenant be|tween me and thee, and thy &s;eed after thee, in their generations for an everla&s;ting covenant;
<PB N="27" REF="003351_0029_0FF817A49E6E5050">
to be a God unto thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee.</HI> Which ble&s;&s;ing is come on the believing Gentiles thro' JESUS CHRIST, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.14. Let Parents then under the realizing view of the frailty of this life, make ha&s;t to lay hold of GOD's Covenant, and to give up them&s;elves and their Seed to Him as their GOD, and that with their whole hearts; that whatever changes pa&s;s over your Hou&s;es, you may rejoyce with <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 23.5. <HI>Although my hou&s;e be not &s;o with God; yet he hath made with me in everla&s;ting covenant, ordered in all things and &s;ure: for this is all my &s;alvation, and all my de&s;ire, although he make it not to grow.</HI> In this way, <HI>devote them to GOD,</HI> that He may own them as His Children, and take them up when you for&s;ake them: In this way, <HI>bring them to CHRIST</HI> for His ble&s;&s;ing, who &s;aid, <HI>Suffer little Children, and forbid them not to come unto me: for of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven,</HI> Mat. 19.14. In this way, <HI>&s;eek to</HI> GOD that they may be <HI>Saved by the wa&s;hing of Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Indeed, we can't &s;ay that all who are vi&s;ibly in Covenant obtain the invi&s;ible Grace and &s;aving Ble&s;&s;ings of the Covenant: <HI>For they are not all I&s;rael, which are of I&s;rael,</HI> Rom. 9.6. Sad experience teach|eth us that not a few have with profane <HI>E&s;au</HI> de&s;pi&s;ed the <HI>Birth-right.</HI> However, this is one of the means of Grace which that GOD hath appointed who alone can command the Ble&s;&s;ing; and the con&s;ideration of the uncertainty of our own lives as well as the lives of our Children,

&s;hould make us &s;peedy and very &s;erious in this Covenant tran&s;action with GOD on their be|half, that we may in faith plead the Promi&s;es of GOD's Covenant for them, when we are a|bout to be taken from them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Teach them the Will of GOD, and call upon them to Choo&s;e that good Part which can't be taken away.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All fle&s;h is as gra&s;s,&mdash; but the word of the LORD endureth for ever</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet 1.24, 25.</NOTE>. O do your utmo&s;t then that they may know the Scrip|tures from their childhood, and have the laws of GOD written upon their hearts. Labour to in&s;till the principles of Religion into them, and teach them early how they mu&s;t fear and &s;erve the LORD, while you look to GOD to fulfill His promi&s;e: I&s;ai. 54.13. <HI>All thy children &s;hall be taught of the LORD</HI>&mdash;. Shew them their &s;in and mi&s;ery by the Fall, and the only remedy provided in JESUS CHRIST, the only Name given among Men whereby we can be &s;av'd. Call upon them to know the GOD of their Fathers, and to choo&s;e Him as their GOD. Urge them to make &s;ure of an Intere&s;t in CHRIST, and the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Covenant; to Repent of their Sins, and make ha&s;te to keep GOD's Commandments; that He may never leave them, and that in Him the unchangable GOD, they may have an unfailing Friend and everla&s;ting Portion.

know not how &s;oon you may be &s;ilent in the Grave: O do not delay then to &s;peak to them about the concerns of their Souls, and to teach them the good knowledge of the LORD, that they may be wi&s;e for Eternity &amp; to Salvation!</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Go before them,</HI> while GOD continueth you with them, <HI>in an holy Exemplary Con|ver&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Walk before GOD</HI> within your hou&s;e with a <HI>perfect heart,</HI> and <HI>before them,</HI> in a <HI>perfect way;</HI> for it is natural and common for Chil|dren to imitate their Parents. It is true, they &s;tand in need of <HI>&s;upernatural Grace,</HI> to enable them to follow your pious Examples; how|ever, the duty is your's, and you mu&s;t di&s;charge it, looking to GOD to turn their feet to His Te&s;timonies. Be exhorted then to &s;et the great and weighty matters of GOD's law before your Children, not only in <HI>verbal In&s;tructions,</HI> but in a <HI>living Pattern;</HI> that they may be en|couraged to <HI>follow your faith, con&s;idering the end of your conver&s;ation.</HI> It may be you have but a little time to be with them, O endea|vour then to do much, by living much to the honour of GOD, the little time that remains! Take heed you do not lay a &s;tumbling-block before them by living in the <HI>Omi&s;&s;ion of Duty,</HI> of Family-prayer, of the &s;trict Ob&s;erva|tion of the Lord's-day, of a devout Attendance on the Lord's Table, &amp;c. Or, <HI>in the Commi&s;&s;ion of Sin,</HI> of profane&s;s, of intemperance, lying, di&s;hone&s;ty in dealing, &amp;c. left they fall after
<PB N="30" REF="003351_0032_0FF817ABEBDED9A8">
your Example, and GOD <HI>vi&s;it the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children.</HI> O do not walk in that broad way which leads to de|&s;truction, left they follow you, and you have a dreadful meeting in Hell; but in that narrow way which leads to life, that you may have a joyful meeting in Heaven.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Endeavour to leave your Children with GOD, when you for&s;ake them; and do what you can that they may live in Peace among them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>The great work we have to do when we come to die, is to commit our departing Spirits into the Hands of JESUS CHRIST, and &s;o to re&s;ign our lives to GOD by Him as a free-will Offering; but this is not all, we &s;hou'd al&s;o commit our dear Relatives, and in particular our Children, to the care of the living GOD, when we are leaving them. If you under&s;tand that word as an exhortation and promi&s;e to GOD's People, it may be fitly applied here, Jer 49.11. <HI>Leave thy fatherle&s;s children, I will pre&s;erve them alive, and let thy widows tru&s;t in me.</HI> Now then commend them to GOD in a &s;olemn manner, and if GOD give you the opportunity, Charge them to keep His Covenant, that they may happily find that GOD is the GOD of His People, and of their Seed in their Generati|ons. And in order to their obtaining the gra|cious Pre&s;ence of GOD with them, you &s;hou'd do what you can that they may dwell together in Unity; for thus runs the promi&s;e, 2 Cor
<PB N="31" REF="003351_0033_0FF817AF18EC5B18">
13.11. &mdash;<HI>Live in Peace: and the God of love and peace &s;hall be with you.</HI> And here it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ay, prudently and &s;ea&s;o|nably &s;ettle your Affairs, that there may be no occa&s;ion of unhappy divi&s;ion and alienation upon temporal accounts.</P>
<P>In a word, <HI>Whatever your hand finds to do</HI> for the welfare of your Children, <HI>do it with your might;</HI> for there is no work nor knowledge in the Grave whither you are going. If there be any Commands or Charges needful for you to give, and them to receive, delay them not, left you be prevented by Death. If you are middle Aged, you may not pre&s;ume you have time enough before you; for not a few die in their full &s;trength: And if GOD hath &s;pared you to old Age, you had need make ha&s;te to attend your duty in the&s;e &amp; other re&s;pects, that when Death comes, you may take leave of your Chil|dren with a comfortable hope that GOD will take them up and ble&s;s them, as He did <HI>I&s;aac</HI> after his Father's death, Gen. 25. 11. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s after the death of Abraham, that God ble&s;&s;ed his &s;on I&s;aac;</HI> and that you &s;hall have a Seed to <HI>&s;erve</HI> GOD on <HI>earth,</HI> when you are <HI>call'd</HI> up to <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> Him in <HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Let the Exhortation be directed, <HI>to Children.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Be thankful to GOD if He continueth your Parents to you after you are grown up.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="003351_0034_0FF817B186ECDF78">It is the &s;orrowful ca&s;e of many, that their Parents for&s;ake them while very young: If it be otherwi&s;e with you, humbly ble&s;s GOD, and con&s;ider how you may be&s;t &s;hew your grateful &s;en&s;e of &s;uch a benefit, and improve it to the honour of GOD, and your own advan|tage. And remember, you are in an e&s;pecial. manner oblig'd thus to expre&s;s your thankful|ne&s;s, if your Parents have not only &s;ome <HI>ex|ternal re&s;emblance</HI> of GOD upon them, who is the Father of all, in the authority this Re|lation gives them over you; but al&s;o his <HI>moral Image</HI> in them, which is created <HI>in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s:</HI> The pre&s;ence of &s;uch Parents who have GOD graciou&s;ly pre&s;ent with them, is a great &s;avour indeed. Happy, thrice happy the Children! who are thus favour'd of the LORD, know their Privi|lege, and wi&s;ely improve it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Do your utmo&s;t that you may be Ble&s;&s;ings and Comforts to them, while they live.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' you are grown to years capable of choo&s;ing &amp; acting for your &s;elves, and remov'd into di&s;tinct Families, yet your obligation to honour your Fathers and Mothers abides with the Relation; tho' indeed the authority of Pa|rents and obedience of Children are to be exer|ci&s;ed after a different manner: Do you then expre&s;s your filial duty in a manner becoming your riper Age, and labour to be helpful to
<PB N="33" REF="003351_0035_0FF817B405FA3E30">
your Parents, even when you are remov'd from under their immediate care. Now endeavour to be under GOD <HI>their Staff,</HI> when they de|cline thro' age; and do what you can to &s;weeten and <HI>brighten</HI> the <HI>evil days</HI> which are come upon them, by your good carriage. O de&s;pi&s;e them not when they are old; but &s;uccour them under their infirmities, and let them now have &s;ome good fruit of their unwearied care and pains with you. <HI>Heavenly Father! for|give our &s;inful defects for Thy Son's &s;ake, with who&s;e perfect Obedience Thou wa&s;t ever well plea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When your Parents for&s;ake you, Look to GOD to take you up.</HI></P>
<P>Prepare for &s;uch a dark hour by taking care to give up your &s;elves to the living GOD, as your GOD and Father, by receiving all the good you can from your Parents, and doing all the good you can to them, while you are con|tinued to each other. Live under the realizing view of their and your own Mortality. Let their commands, and e&s;pecially their dying charges have great weight with you. And when they are taken from you, go to GOD in the Name of CHRIST, and depend on Him for all that light and grace, direction and help which you need. Thus you &s;hall find Him the <HI>Father of Mercies</HI> to you; He will take you up, and make up your lo&s;s in Him&s;elf, and in His CHRTST.</P>
