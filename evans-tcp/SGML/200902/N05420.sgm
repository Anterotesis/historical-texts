<Q><BIBL>Luke xxi. 34.</BIBL> <HI>And take Heed to your&s;elves, le&s;t at any Time, your Hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s, and Cares of this World, and &s;o that Day come upon you unawares.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS the Day of our Death, and the Day of Judgement, will quickly overtake us all; when we are to be eternally fixed in a State of con&s;umate Glory and Happi|ne&s;s, or of everla&s;ting Shame and Mi&s;ery: Ac|cording as we &s;hall be found, to have conducted our&s;elves here in the Body. It is of the la&s;t Importance to us all, that we live every one of our Days, &s;o as to be in a continual Readine&s;s, for that great Day of &s;olemn Accounts; when God will bring to Light every &s;ecret and hiden Work of Darkne&s;s; and Judge the Secrets of Men's Hearts According to the Go&s;pel. Le&s;t that Day coming upon us unawares; we be found unprepared and unready; and &s;o peri&s;h for ever without Remedy. Concerning which, we are called upon here in our Text, to take Heed to our&s;elves.&mdash;Our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord Je&s;us who &s;pake the&s;e Words; had been treating on the De&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, of the fearful Signs and terrible Di&s;&s;olations of that Day; when the Son of Man &s;hould come, to execute Vengeance upon that People, for their great Sin
<PB N="3" REF="006862_0003_102A7EA59FA30790">of Rejecting and Crucifying him, the Lord of Life and Glory. Which De&s;truction of the Jewi&s;h State; was a Sort of Emblem, of the coming of the Son of God, to judge the World. And &s;o the Day of our Death and the Day of Judgment; will be as Important a Day to us, as that was to the Jews; and a Day for which we are equally concerned to be in a Readine&s;s. and therefore the Words of our Text, are as needful and applicable to us, in the View of ap|proaching Death and Judgment; as to the im|mediate Hearers of Chri&s;t, with Regard to the threatned De&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem. For Death and Judgement, even as to them, were the main Things implyed in the coming of that Day. But here then, in the Words of our Text, you have the Call and Command of Chri&s;t, to <HI>take Heed to your&s;elves,</HI> to look to it, with a &s;trict Guard and Watch over your&s;elves, as in a Ca&s;e of great Danger, in a Matter of the utmo&s;t Importance, <HI>le&s;t at any Time your Hearts be overcharged;</HI> le&s;t the Powers and Faculties of your Minds be Cloged in their Operations; <HI>with Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s,</HI> by eating or drinking to Exce&s;s, &s;o as either to overload the Stomach or impair the Brain; or le&s;t the Heart be filled with carking and &s;olicitous <HI>Cares</HI> and Concerns about the Things <HI>of this pre&s;ent Life; And &s;o that Day,</HI> the Day of Death and
<PB N="4" REF="006862_0004_102A7EA781AC1DA8">Judgment, <HI>come upon you unawares.</HI> For &s;uch Indulgences, will a&s;&s;uredly render you, utterly unfit and unready for that great Day; and &s;o be your eternal Ruin. And therefore ye had Need, take Heed to your&s;elves, le&s;t at any Time ye be overtaken therein. But it is the Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s here &s;poken of, that I chiefly de&s;ign to treat of at this Time. And &s;o the Doctrine to be noted from the Words may be this.</P>
<P>Doc. <HI>That to eat or to drink to Exce&s;s, &s;o as to have the Heart overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s, is a very ruinous and de&s;tructive Sin, of which it concerns every one, to take Heed to them&s;elves, le&s;t at any Time, they be over taken therein.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="5" REF="006862_0005_102A7EA9D302A360">
Becau&s;e it is innocent and Lawful, and even a Duty, to eat and to drink; therefore Men are ready to flatter them&s;elves, that they are not cheargeable with Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s; except they run into &s;uch very gro&s;s Exce&s;s therein, as wholly to over power all their Facul|ties and Sen&s;es. But every Degree of Exce&s;s in Meats and in Drinks, is a Degree of Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s. But clearly to &s;et forth, what it is, to eat or to drink to Exce&s;s, it is to be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the End and De&s;ign of Meats and of Drinks, is to &s;atisfy the innocent Cravings of Nature; and &s;o to fit for the Service of God and the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life.</HI> As God has been plea&s;ed to frame our Bodies &s;o, as that Meats and Drinks are ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, to nouri&s;h and &s;trengthen our animal Nature. So he has been plea&s;ed, wi&s;ely to implant in our Natures, tho&s;e Appetites called Hunger and Thir&s;t; which as the Body needs Refre&s;hment, naturally rai&s;e an unea&s;y Sen&s;ation in us; thereby to excite us to take needful Su&s;tenance; without which, Men would &s;ome Times be in Danger of Neglecting Food, to the great Injury of their animal Nature. And as God for wi&s;e Ends, has implanted the&s;e Natural Appetites. So from the Openings of his bountiful Hand, he is wont in the common Cour&s;e of his Providence; to grant a plentiful
<PB N="6" REF="006862_0006_102A7EAC0BC02208">Supply of Meats and Drinks; and that in a very great and plea&s;ing Variety, to &s;atisfy all the innocent Cravings of Nature. But then the&s;e Cravings of Nature, and the Provi&s;ion which God in his good Providence makes for the Sup|ply thereof; are for much higher and nobler Purpo&s;es, than meerly to gratify and plea&s;e the Fle&s;h: Even that our Hearts might be filled, with Gratitude and Thankfulne&s;s to God; and that we might be &s;trengthened for his Service, and for all the nece&s;&s;ary Duties and Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life. And therefore our Appetites of Hunger and Thir&s;t, are then only innocent, when they crave no more, than is good for our Nature; for our Noun&s;hment, Strengthening and Com|fort. And indeed, &s;o far to gratify the&s;e Ap|petites, as tends to fill our Hearts with Grati|tude to God for his Bounties; and al&s;o to Ca|pacitate us for his Service, and the nece&s;&s;ary Duties of Life; is not only innocent and lawful; but even a Duty, enjoyned in the &s;ixth Com|mandment. Which requires all lawful En|deavours to pre&s;erve our own Lives. And to &s;uch a Degree, Men may truely eat and drink for the Glory of God, as we are required. 1 Cor. x. 31. <HI>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</HI> All Things are and were created for God's Glory. And to this End, &s;hould we live, and to
<PB N="7" REF="006862_0007_102A7EAEB38F0538">this End &s;hould we improve all the good Creatures of God, even to his Glory. But then.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To eat or to drink, &s;o as to di&s;order the Faculties of Body or of Mind, and render our|&s;elves unfit for the Service of God, or the Duties of Life; is to overcharge the Heart with Sur|feiting and Drunkenne&s;s.</HI> While a moderate Portion of Meats and of Drinks, by the Good Providence of God, kindly nouri&s;hes and &s;trengthens our animal Nature; a greater Mea|&s;ure overloads the Stomach, blunts the Sen&s;es, and renders Men dull and li&s;tle&s;s; or intoxicates the Brain, and &s;tupifies the Mind. And &s;o in|di&s;po&s;es Men, either for the Service of God, or the Duties of Life. And thus to eat or to drink, to &s;uch a Degree, as to incapacitate our|&s;elves in any Mea&s;ure, for a due Di&s;charge of the Duties which we owe, to God, to our Neighbour or our&s;elves; is &s;o far to fru&s;trate the good End and De&s;ign of Meats, and of Drinks: And therefore is an exce&s;&s;ive U&s;e and Abu&s;e thereof. Every Degree of which, &s;o far as it overcharges the Heart, intoxicates the Mind, or blunts the Sen&s;es, and incapacitates for Duty, is a Mea&s;ure of Surfeiting and Drunken|ne&s;s. But in this Exce&s;s, there are various Degrees; though every Degree of Exce&s;s is Sin. But the more the Heart is overcharged, and the Powers and Faculties incapacitated for
<PB N="8" REF="006862_0008_102A7EB0F329DAC8">Duty; the more gro&s;s and heinous is the Sin. To eat and drink &s;o far only, as is truely for our Nouri&s;hment and Comfort, falls within the Laws of Chri&s;tian Temperance and Sobriety. But what&s;oever is more than this, is Evil, be|ing a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Laws of Nature and of Chri&s;t: And is a Mea&s;ure of Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s. But,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Of the ruinous and de&s;tructive Nature, of this Sin of Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s; or of eating and drinking to Exce&s;s, with the &s;ad and fatal Con&s;equences thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Exce&s;s in Meats and in Drinks, have in many Re&s;pects, the &s;ame Tendency and the &s;ame bad Con&s;equence. Tho' that of intemperate drink|ing, as it is commonly much the mo&s;t Preva|lent, &s;o it is ordinarily attended, with much the mo&s;t fatal Con&s;equences. And to this therefore I &s;hall chiefly have my Eye, in con&s;idering the ruinous and de&s;tructive Nature of Intempe|rance. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It impairs the Con&s;titution, and enfeebles the Powers and Faculties of Body and of Mind.</HI> It don't only incapacitate to Duty, while the Heart is overcharged. But it tends to impair the animal Frame; to bring on Di&s;ea&s;es; and &s;o to &s;horten Men's Days, and ha&s;ten them down to the Grave, as it were before their Time. At lea&s;t it much enfeebles Men's Powers and
<PB N="9" REF="006862_0009_102A7EB3319B0150">Faculties, it con&s;umes their Strength, it fades their Beauty, it weakens their Rea&s;on, &s;hat|ters their Judgment, and &s;tupifies Con&s;cience. And &s;o it tends to bring Men down, as to their Powers and Faculties, to be even as Children and Fools. Temperance is a great Friend to our natural Capacities, and tends to &s;trengthen them. But every Fit of Intemperance, tends to enfeeble all a Man's Powers; and &s;o to bring him down to the Du&s;t, or to a Level even with the Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is a great Moth to Men's temporal E&s;tates; and tends to bring Poverty upon them&s;elves and their Families.</HI></P>
<P>Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s, is an eating Can|ker, a fatal Con&s;umption, to Men's E&s;tates. Both, as it is attended with needle&s;s and extra|vagant Expences, and e&s;pecially, as it incapaci|tates Men for their Bu&s;ine&s;s; prevents their be|ing Diligent and prudent, and occa&s;ions much mi&s;pence of Time; in drow&s;ine&s;s, &s;auntring and Idlene&s;s, or in fooli&s;h, vain and wicked Company. And &s;o tends to bring on many bad Habits, which &s;oon plunge Men and their Families into Poverty and Di&s;tre&s;s. For as the wi&s;e Man &s;ays, <HI>The Drunkard and the Glutton &s;hall come to Poverty.</HI> And accordingly it is no uncommon Thing in the World, to &s;ee very likely and promi&s;ing Men, with fair and hand&s;ome E&s;tates,
<PB N="10" REF="006862_0010_102A7EB56B69FF98">not only ruined, as to their own U&s;efulne&s;s and Improvement in the World; but plunged into the very Depths of Poverty, Cloathed with Rags, their Wives and Children turned out of Hou&s;e and Home, and them&s;elves become as Vaga|bonds on the Earth: Only thro' Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s, as the Root of all this dreadful Calamity. A Spectacle, that might well make a Heart of Stone to relent and weep: That to gratify a filthy Lu&s;t, Men &s;hould bring them|&s;elves and their Families, into &s;uch deplorable Ruin; even as to the pre&s;ent Life. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s unman's Men, and makes them even a Shame and Reproach among Men.</HI></P>
<P>Of all Sins, it makes Men appear the mo&s;t deformed and ridiculous; &s;o that it renders them, a Laughing Stock and Scorn, even to Children. While Men's Heads are intoxicated and Swim with Fumes, they are ready to count the World all their own; who, &s;o happy &s;o witty and wi&s;e as they! While at the &s;ame Time, all their Beholders look on them, with Pity and Grief, or with Scorn and Contempt, making them the Fool of their Play, their Laugh and Deri&s;ion. So that one would think, a Man that has any Sen&s;e of Honour; and any manly Re|gard to his own Reputation and good Name; would rather chu&s;e to Die, even a Thou&s;and
<PB N="11" REF="006862_0011_102A7EB80D2A50C8">Deaths; than to drink him&s;elf &s;uch a Scorn and Deri&s;ion among Men. <HI>A good Name is better than precious Ointment.</HI> But a Man's good Name is gone to all Intents, when once he has drank him&s;elf, into the Name of a Drunkard. And in&s;tead of being honoured and e&s;teemed, he can expect nothing, but to be the Scorn and Deri&s;ion, even of the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t ignoble Part of his Species. <HI>Wine is a Mocker,</HI> and it makes Men a Mock and Reproach among Men. And.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s, is a Sin lead|ing to many other Sins.</HI></P>
<P>It lays a Man open and renders him an ea&s;y Prey to every Temptation. It &s;o takes away the Rea&s;on and Judgment, that it leaves Men without any Guard and Watch over them&s;elves; and &s;o leads to a Thou&s;and Extravagances and Follies. It fills Men's Mouths with vain Bab|blings, with un&s;eemly, &s;illy and fooli&s;h Talk|ing. Yea it imboldens Men, to take God's Name in vain, to Cur&s;e and Swear and Lie in Je&s;t: And to make a Mock and Deri&s;ion of Things Sacred and Divine. It prompts Men to &s;peak Evilly and Reproachfully of their Neighbours without Cau&s;e; and to &s;lander and revile the Vertuous and Good; and is many Times the Occa&s;ion of a Tumultuous Feud, of boi&s;terous, haughty and angry Pa&s;&s;ions. <HI>Strong
<PB N="12" REF="006862_0012_102A7EBAF0405F08">Drink is Raging.</HI> Prov. xx. 1. And &s;o hurries Men into Quarrels and Contentions, to Spite and Revenge; and &s;ometimes even to Blows and Blood &s;hed. As the Wi&s;e Man &s;ays, <HI>Who hath Wo? Who hath Sorrow? Who hath Conten|tions? Who hath Babbling? Who hath Wounds without Cau&s;e? Who hath Redne&s;s of Eyes? They that tarry long at the Wine, they that go to &s;eek mixt Wine.</HI> Prov. xxiii. 29, 30. Yea it lays open and expo&s;es all a Man's Weakne&s;s, Frailties and Imperfections: What ever Follies, Lu&s;t and Pa&s;&s;ions he is incident unto; an intoxi|cated Brain throws off the Covering, and Expo&s;es all the Man's Nakedne&s;s. It betrays his mo&s;t &s;ecret Betru&s;tments, to his own Shame, and the Shame of his Friend. Sometimes it makes Men very Talkative in Matters of Religion; full of Con|fidence, and expre&s;&s;ive of great Joys and Com|forts; to their own great Shame, and the great Reproach and Scandal of the Religion which they profe&s;s: Which of all Thing is mo&s;t grievous and &s;hocking to behold. And it is al&s;o a great Incentive to fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, and to wanton lacivious and uncha&s;t Words and Actions. And often occa&s;ions Quarrels and Contentions in Families. Yea it is a leading Thing to all Man|ner of Iniquity. Be&s;ides, it utterly indi&s;po&s;es to every Religious Duty; excludes all &s;erious Thoughts out of the Mind; and &s;huts the
<PB N="13" REF="006862_0013_102A7EBD271B0838">Reading of God's Word, and &s;ecret and Family Prayer, out of their Families and out of their Clo&s;ets; or makes Men's Prayers, offered with the Fumes of an intoxicated Brain, a mo&s;t hor|rid Abomination indeed to the Lord. And verily there can be no true Fear of God; no Regard for his Glory; no true Devotion at Heart, no true Gratitude and Prai&s;e to God, no Watching and Striving again&s;t the World and the Fle&s;h, no A&s;piring after Heavenly Things, no true Mournings and Relentings for Sin, no perfecting Holine&s;s in the Fear of God and no Runing for Eternal Life, while the Heart is overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s. But all Preten&s;ions to Re|ligion in this Ca&s;e, are a Reproach to Religion it&s;elf; and a mo&s;t horrid Offence and Abomi|nation both to God and to Men. And the Intere&s;t of the Soul inevitably runs back, and &s;inks with an inconceivable Swiftne&s;s down into the Depths of Pollution and Guilt. And &s;o,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s do inevitably unfit the Soul for Death and Judgment; and expo&s;e it to certain and Everla&s;ting Ruin and De&s;truction.</HI> As it is a Sin that impairs Man's rational Powers, that inflames every Lu&s;t, and leads on to a Flood of Inquity; &s;o it is a Sin that doth vile Di&s;honour to God, that abates his Mercies, that pollutes the Soul, that loads
<PB N="14" REF="006862_0014_102A7EBEB6A5AB78">it with Guilt, and that renders it utterly unmeet for the Kingdom of Heaven; and &s;o expo&s;eth it to the avenging Strokes of Divine Ju&s;tice. And &s;uch God has a&s;&s;ured us, &s;hall not inherit his Heavenly Kingdom. 1 Cor. vi. 9. 10. <HI>Know ye not that the unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither Forni|cators, nor Idolators, &amp;c. nor Drunkards, &s;hall inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> And again. Gal. v. 19. 20. <HI>Now the Works of the Fle&s;h are manife&s;t, which are The&s;e, Adultery, Fornication, &amp;c. and Drunkenne&s;s, of the which I tell you before, as I have told you in Time pa&s;t, that they which do &s;uch Things, &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> And wo therefore, as it is written, I&s;ai. v. 22. <HI>Wo unto them that are mighty to drink Wine, and Men of Strength to mingle Strong Drink.</HI> And wo to &s;uch indeed, for they are going in the high Road to Ruin and De|&s;truction; they are heaping up to them&s;elves Shame, Poverty and Reproach in this World, and trea&s;uring up to them&s;elves Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath. And when ever Death and Judgment over takes them, they mu&s;t, without a deep and thorough Repentance, inevitably ly down in everla&s;ting Shame and Confu&s;ion, un|der the eternal Wrath and Cur&s;e of God. For He that can't lie has &s;aid, they &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of God. And therefore, when

And then may it be &s;aid with an Empha&s;is, as in Joel, 1. 5. <HI>Awake ye Drunkards, and Weep, and Howl, all ye Drinkers of Wine, becau&s;e of the new Wine, for it is cut off from your Mouth.</HI> Oh how fearfully ruinous and de&s;tructive indeed, in Time and forever, is this Sin of Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s. But.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>To &s;hew the great Need, that every one &s;hould take Heed to them&s;elves, le&s;t at any Time, they be overtaken in this ruinous Sin.</HI> To take Heed le&s;t at any Time we be overtaken in this Sin; <HI>Implyes,</HI> that we keep a very &s;trict Guard and Watch over our&s;elves: Le&s;t under a Pretence of &s;atisfying the innocent Cravings of Nature; and of Eating and Drinking for the needful Refre&s;hment and Nouri&s;hment of our Bodies: We take more than is meet; overcharge our Hearts, and plunge our&s;elves into a Degree of Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s. And that we Watch and Guard our&s;elves, not only, again&s;t a prevailing Habit of Exce&s;s herein, but again&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="006862_0016_102A7EC429E4FDA8">taking to Exce&s;s at any Time, and in any Degree; le&s;t Exce&s;s at one Time, and in one Degree, enlarge our Appetite and inflame our Thir&s;t; &s;o as to make Way for Exce&s;s at another Time, and in a greater Degree; till we be overborne, and carried headlong down the Precipice of this ruinous Sin. Again, this taking Heed to our&s;elves, <HI>Implyes,</HI> that we carefully keep at a &s;afe and &s;ecure Di&s;tance from this Sin. That we think not to dally with it; that we give not way to the Gratifi|cation of our Appetites, to the farthe&s;t Extent of what we imagine our Natures may po&s;&s;ibly bear. <HI>E&s;pecially</HI> if we find, that at any Time, we have been overtaken in any Degree of Ex|ce&s;s, and have eat or drank more than was meet; or if we find that inordinate Cravings and Thir&s;tings begin &s;ecretly to grow in, and prevail upon us; that we do then awake, to a double Guard and Watch over our&s;elves; to keep at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance from, and even wholly to deny our&s;elves, any U&s;e at all, of tho&s;e particular Meats, and Drinks, whereby we are in &s;pecial Danger: Rather than to venture the fatal Hazard of Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s. To pretend to take Heed again&s;t any Evil, and yet tamper with the Temptations to it; as to pretend to take Heed again&s;t Surfeit|ing and Drunkenne&s;s; and yet indulge ones &s;elf
<PB N="17" REF="006862_0017_102A7EC69430ABB0">to the very Borders of Exce&s;s, and frequent drinking Places and drinking Company, is but a vain Pretence. For the intoxicating Cup is in&s;naring, and &s;oon alures to Exce&s;s. But he that would take due Heed to him&s;elf, mu&s;t watchfully &s;hun the Way, the Place, and Company, and even the very Appearance of Exce&s;s. And &s;tand at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance from tho&s;e Evils, with which he finds him&s;elf mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et. <HI>And now Men have all Need to watch mo&s;t heedfully, again&s;t this Sin of Intemperance.</HI> Not only becau&s;e it is &s;uch a Ruinous and de&s;tructive Evil, to them&s;elves and their Families, to their Bodies and to their Souls, to their Honour, Intere&s;t and Welfare, in Time and to all Eternity: All which &s;hould be weighty and powerful Motives with us, to excite us, to utmo&s;t watchfulne&s;s again&s;t this Sin. But there are farther Rea&s;ons al&s;o, why we had need take Heed le&s;t at any Time we be overtaken in this Sin. As</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Becau&s;e it is a Sin that we are all na|turally incident unto, and in Danger of.</HI> As we are fallen Creatures, the noble Powers of our Minds are wofully ruined, and the Fle&s;hly Appetites are prone to break out into great Exorbitancy, to exceed their proper Bounds and run into Exce&s;s. So that we are naturally inclined to exceed the Bounds of Temperance
<PB N="18" REF="006862_0018_102A7EC823F51018">and Sobriety; to let Rea&s;on and Judgment give way to Inclination and Lu&s;t; and &s;o to be governed by fle&s;hly Appetites and De&s;ires, more than by Rea&s;on and Judg|ment. So that unle&s;s we take Heed to our&s;elves, to mortify and keep under the Deeds of the Body; our craving Appetites will &s;oon plunge us into Exce&s;s. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is a Sin which Men are very ready to palliate and excu&s;e them&s;elves in; at lea&s;t, as to &s;ome of the fir&s;t and lowe&s;t Degrees thereof.</HI> For as every Kind of Meat and Drink is given for the U&s;e and Benefit of Man, and may lawfully be u&s;ed for our good and Comfort. Therefore Men in Com|pliance with their exorbitant Appetites and De&s;ires, are ready to per&s;wade them&s;elves, that more is for their Comfort, than is in any wi&s;e for their good. And &s;o, under the Notion of taking for their Comfort, they excu&s;e them&s;elves in taking to Exce&s;s: So much as really to di&s;compo&s;e their Minds, and render them fooli&s;h and ridiculous; though they drown not all their Sen&s;es. So that it is an in&s;naring Evil, that creeps upon
<PB N="19" REF="006862_0019_102A7ECA5D9F5020">Men unawares. And therefore had need to be heedfully watched again&s;t; as a &s;e|cret undermining Enemy, that doth not make the fir&s;t On&s;et, by an open A&s;&s;ault, but by underhand Craft and De|ceit. And,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is a very growing Sin.</HI> Where it once begins to get Footing it often gains Ground apace, and is rarely expelled. As Intempe|rance at the fir&s;t, commonly &s;teals upon Men by in&s;en&s;ible Degrees; &s;o every Degree leaves vitiated Taint, and inflamed Thir&s;t behind, which lays the Foundation, for &s;till greater and greater Exce&s;s; as Time and Opportunity &s;erves, or Temptation pre&s;ents: Till &s;ome|times Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s, to a very great and &s;hameful Degree, gets &s;trongly rooted, even into a prevailing Habit in Men; and they get deep in the Pit, and wofully in|tangled in the Snare; ere they are aware of the Danger they are in. And then alas, exorbitant Cravings being grown into a Ha|bit, 'tis hard for Men thoroughly to reform. <HI>As for the Ethiopian to change his Skin or the Leopard his Spots.</HI> And thus it is in Fact
<PB N="20" REF="006862_0020_102A7ECC509967A8">too rarely &s;een in the World, that an habituated Drunkard, ever e&s;capes the Snares, to lead a Life truely Sober and temperate. And therefore Men had need take Heed betimes, left at any Time, their Hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunken|ne&s;s; and &s;o this Sin &s;teal upon them, and get the Prevalency over them una|wares; to the utter Ruin of their Name and E&s;tate, Welfare and Happine&s;s, for Time and Eternity. And,</P>
<P><HI>Finally, It is a Sin that doth vile Di&s;|honour to God.</HI> As it leads to many other Sins, expo&s;es all a Man's Frailties and Fol|lies, and indi&s;po&s;eth to a due Performance of any religious Duty; &s;o it Leads to in|numerable Provocations again&s;t Heaven; doth the vile&s;t Di&s;honour to Religion; and gives even the Heathen Occa&s;ion to &s;coff and Bla&s;pheme. So that if Men have any Regard to the Glory of God, any Fear to offend him, any De&s;ire to honour and plea&s;e him, or any Regard for the Honour of that Religion which they pro|fe&s;s, or de&s;ire to &s;hare the Ble&s;&s;ings, or
<PB N="21" REF="006862_0021_102A7ED000E00790">Care to &s;hun the Cur&s;es of it: They had need take Heed to them&s;elves in Earne&s;t; le&s;t at any Time their Hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunken|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>But to come to the,</P>
<P><HI>Improvement.</HI> Our fir&s;t U&s;e, may be of <HI>Solemn Warning, to all &s;uch as are given to intemperate Indulgences.</HI> Would to God there were none &s;uch among&s;t us, For it is too &s;hameful an Evil once to be mentioned, among tho&s;e that call them|&s;elves Chri&s;tians. But alas, it is greatly to be feared, that it is a very growing and prevailing Iniquity; both more publickly and privately; to the great Scandal and Reproach of the Chri&s;tian Name. May the Lord of his infinite Mercy, give an hearing Ear, and an under&s;tanding Heart, to all &s;uch of you my Hearers, as are given to inordinate Appetites and De&s;ires; that you may awake to a Sen&s;e of your Danger, and be roa&s;ed up to take Diligent Heed to your&s;elves. For is &s;trong Drink become your Ma&s;ter; are you fallen into
<PB N="22" REF="006862_0022_102A7ED18F9DDD20">the Habit of Being frequently overcome thereby; or of drinking to Exce&s;s, &s;o as to di&s;compo&s;e and intoxicate your Mind. Alas, it is a &s;ad, a pitiful, yea and mo&s;t dangerous Ca&s;e that you are in. For you are in very-deed, next Door to Ruin and De&s;truction; in the mo&s;t ready way to be undone, Soul and Body for ever. There is utmo&s;t Danger, that this Sin will pre|vail upon you, and that you will hence|forward wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e. Yea ex|cept you rou&s;e up, and take the mo&s;t carne&s;t Heed to your&s;elves; yours is a gone Ca&s;e; a dreadful Pit that you are fallen into; an almo&s;t inextricable Snare that you are intangied in. O that you would yet come to your&s;elves, look about you, and think in carne&s;t, what are the certain fearful and dreadful Con&s;equences of a Cour&s;e of Intemperance, Surfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s. Thereby, your Powers are &s;oon impaired, your good Name ruin'd your Honour lo&s;t, your Follies expo&s;ed, your&s;elves made a Scorn and a Deri&s;ion, your E&s;tates im|poveri&s;hed, your Families injured and

And alas, can one that has the Rea&s;on and Spirit of a Man, carele&s;ly plunge him&s;elf into all the&s;e deplorable Calamities; for the &s;ake of gratifying, a wor&s;e than bea&s;tly Gu&s;t and Appetite?

Alas, alas, all that is worthily dear to you in the World; your Health, your good Name, your E&s;tates, your Families, your Wives, your
