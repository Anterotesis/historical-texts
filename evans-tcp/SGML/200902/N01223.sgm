<P>In One Word, <HI>A Publick Spirit.</HI> Let him THEREFORE, and upon more than all the&s;e Accounts be, Sir WILLIAM ASHHURST.

HE 'tis whom the Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>All Men</HI> brings into the Catalogue, with <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> and tho&s;e other Ancient Ble&s;&s;ings, who are thus Excellently de&s;cribed by <HI>Grotious; Ho|mines demerendis hominibus nati, qui Omnem Bene|ficij Collocandi Occa&s;ionem Ponebant in Lucro.

<P>I will pre&s;ume to do &s;omething, that will carry a Sweet Harmony, with One of the Main Methods to be ob&s;erved in Pro&s;ecuting the De|&s;ign

of this Book; which is, For <HI>Brethren to Dwell together in Unity,</HI> and carry on every Good De|&s;ign with <HI>United Endeavours.</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>They will Pardon me, if I take the leave to joyn with him, in the Te&s;timonies of our Great E&s;teem, for an Honourable Di&s;po&s;ition to <HI>Love Good Men,</HI> and to <HI>Do Good in the World,</HI> his Excellent Brother-in-Law. The well-known Name of a, JOSEPH THOMPSON, has long been valued, and &s;hall alwayes be Remembred, in the Coun|try where this Book is Publi&s;hed. God will be Glorified, for the Piety which adorns him, and the <HI>Pure Religion,</HI> which in the mid&s;t of the World, and of Temptations from it, keeps him &s;o <HI>Un&s;potted from the World.</HI> It was the Maxim of a Pagan <HI>A&s;drubal</HI> in <HI>Livy, Raro &s;imul hominibus, bona Fortuna, bonaque mens datur. Chri&s;tianity</HI> will, in this Gentleman, give to the World, an happy Experiment, that the Maxim is capable of a con|futation. Becau&s;e a Book of <HI>E&s;&s;ayes to Do Good,</HI> will doubtle&s;s find its Agreeable Acceptance with One of So <HI>Good a Mind,</HI> and the Trea&s;urer of a Corporation formed on the Intention to do in <HI>America</HI> that Good which is of all the greate&s;t, whereof Sir <HI>William A&s;hhur&s;t</HI> is the Governour, he al&s;o has a part in the Humble Tender of it; and it mu&s;t wi&s;h unto Him <HI>all the Ble&s;&s;ings of Goodne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The BOOK requires that now &s;ome Account be given of it. It was a Pa&s;&s;age, in a Speech of an Envoy from His <HI>Britanick</HI> Maje&s;ty, to the
<PB N="v" REF="001460_0006_0FB3499B79B05B38">
Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> Twenty years ago; <HI>A Capacity to Do Good, not only gives a Title to it, but al&s;o makes the doing of it a Duty. Ink</HI> were too vile a Liquor to Write that Pa&s;&s;age. <HI>Letters of Gold</HI> were too Mean, to be the Pre&s;ervers of it. Paper of <HI>Amyanthus</HI> would not be Precious and Perennous enough, to perpetuate it.</P>
<P>To be brief, Reader, The <HI>Book</HI> now in thy Hands, is nothing but an Illu&s;tration, and a Pro|&s;ecution of that Memorable Sentence. As <HI>Gold</HI> is capable of a Wonderful Dilatation; Experi|ment has told us, it may be &s;o dilated, that the Hundred thou&s;andth part of a <HI>Grain,</HI> may be vi|&s;ible without a <HI>Micro&s;cope:</HI> This <HI>Golden Sentence</HI> may be as much Extended; no man can &s;ay how much. This Book is but a <HI>Beating</HI> upon it. And at the &s;ame time, 'tis a Commentary on that In&s;pired Maxim, Gal. VI. 10. <HI>As we have Oppor|tunity, let us do Good unto all men:</HI> Every <HI>Propo|&s;al</HI> here made upon it hopes to be able to &s;ay, <HI>When I am tried, I &s;hall come forth as Gold.</HI></P>
<P>I have not been left altogether Uninformed, That all the Rules of <HI>Di&s;cretion</HI> and <HI>Behaviour,</HI> are embryo'd in that One Word, MODESTY. But it will be no breach of <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> to be very <HI>Po|&s;itive</HI> in a&s;&s;erting, That the only <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of Man, lies in Conver&s;ing with the Great GOD, and His Glorious CHRIST; and in Engaging as many others as we can, to joyn with us in this our Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; thereby Promoting His <HI>King|dom</HI> among the Children of Men; and in Stu|dying
<PB N="vi" REF="001460_0007_0FB3499CA28DE6C8">
to <HI>Do Good</HI> unto all about us; to be <HI>Ble&s;|&s;ings</HI> in our &s;everal Relations; to heal the Di&s;|orders, and help the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a Mi&s;erable World, as far as ever we can Extend our Influen|ces. It will be no Tre&s;pa&s;s upon the Rules of <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> with all po&s;&s;ible <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> to a&s;&s;ert. That no man begins to be <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> till he come to make this the <HI>Main</HI> Purpo&s;e and Plea&s;ure of his Life; Yea, that every Man will at &s;ome time or other be &s;o <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> as to own, that every thing without this is but <HI>Folly,</HI> tho' alas, the mo&s;t of Men come not unto it, until it be <HI>Too Late.</HI></P>
<P>Millions of Men, in all Ranks, be&s;ides tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>Dying</HI> Thoughts are collected in, <HI>The Fair Warnings to a carele&s;s World,</HI> have at length de|clared their Conviction of it. It will be no <HI>Im|mode&s;ty</HI> in me to &s;ay, The Man who is not Satis|fyed of the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> in making it the Work of his <HI>Life</HI> to <HI>Do Good,</HI> is alwayes to be beheld with the Pity due to an <HI>Ideot.</HI> No <HI>Fir&s;t Principles</HI> are more <HI>Peremptorily</HI> to be adhered unto. Or, Do but grant <HI>A Judgment to come,</HI> and my A&s;&s;ertion is pre&s;ently victorious.</P>
<P>I will not be <HI>Immode&s;t,</HI> and yet I will boldly &s;ay, The Man is wor&s;e than a <HI>Pagan,</HI> who will not come into this Notion of things, <HI>Vir Bonus e&s;t Commune Bonum;</HI> and <HI>Vivit is qui multis e&s;t u&s;ui;</HI> and <HI>Utilitate Hominum, nil debet e&s;&s;e Homini Antiquius.</HI> None but a <HI>Good Man,</HI> is really a <HI>Living</HI> Man; And the more <HI>Good</HI> any Man does, the more he really <HI>Lives, All the re&s;t is Death;</HI>

or belongs to it. Yea, you mu&s;t Excu&s;e me, if I &s;ay, The <HI>Mahometan</HI> al&s;o &s;hall condemn the Man, who comes not into the Principles of this Book. For I think, it occurs no le&s;s than Three Times in the <HI>Alcoran; God Loves tho&s;e that are in|clined to do Good.</HI></P>
<P>For this <HI>way of Living,</HI> if we are fallen into a <HI>Generation,</HI> wherein men will cry, <HI>[Sotah!] He's a Fool,</HI> of him that practi&s;es it, as the Rabbi's foretel, 'twil be in the <HI>Generation wherein the Me&s;|&s;iah comes;</HI> yet there will be a <HI>Wi&s;er</HI> Generation, and <HI>Wi&s;dom will be Ju&s;tified of her Children.</HI> A|mong the Jews, there has been an <HI>Ezra,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Head</HI> they called, <HI>The Throne of Wi&s;dom:</HI> Among the <HI>Greeks</HI> there has been a <HI>Democritus,</HI> who was called <GAP DESC="foreign">, in the Ab&s;tract; The Later Ages knew a <HI>Gildas,</HI> who wore the Sirname of, <HI>Sa|piens;</HI> But it is the man who&s;e <HI>Temper</HI> &amp; <HI>Intent</HI> it is, <HI>To Do Good,</HI> that is the Truly <HI>Wi&s;e man</HI> af|ter all. And indeed had a man, the Hands of a <HI>Briareus,</HI> they would all be too few to <HI>Do Good;</HI> He might find occa&s;ions to call for more than all of them. The Engli&s;h Nation once had a Sect of men called, <HI>Bon-hommes,</HI> or, <HI>Good men.</HI> The Ambition of this Book, is to Revive and Enlarge a <HI>Sect</HI> that may claim that Name; yea, to Sollicit, that it may Extend beyond the Bounds of a <HI>Sect,</HI> by the coming of <HI>all men</HI> into it.</P>
<P>Of all the <HI>Trees in the Garden of God,</HI> which is there, that Envies not the <HI>Palm-tree,</HI> out of which alone <HI>Plutarch</HI> tells us, the <HI>Babylonians</HI> fetch'd

more than Three Hundred Commodities? Or the <HI>Coco-tree,</HI> &s;o Beneficial to Man, that a Ve&s;&s;el may be built, and rigg'd, and freighted and Victualled from that alone? To <HI>Plant</HI> &s;uch <HI>Trees of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Prune</HI> them, is the Hope of the Book now before us.</P>
<P>The Men who <HI>Devi&s;e Good,</HI> will now give me leave to mind them of Some things, by which they may be a little Fortified for their Grand Intention; For, Sirs, you are to pa&s;s between <HI>Boz<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">z</HI> (or, Dirty,) and <HI>Seneh,</HI> (or Thorny) and Encounter an Ho&s;t of things wor&s;e than <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> in your undertaking.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;con&s;truction</HI> is One thing again&s;t which you will do well to furni&s;h your &s;elves with the Armour both of <HI>Prudence</HI> and of <HI>Patience;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> for the preventing of it, <HI>Patience</HI> for the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of it. You will unavoidably be put upon the Doing of many <HI>Good Things,</HI> which o|ther People will &s;ee but <HI>at a Di&s;tance,</HI> and be unacquainted with the <HI>Motives</HI> and <HI>Methods</HI> of your doing them; yea, they may imagine their own <HI>Purpo&s;es</HI> cro&s;&s;ed, or clogged in what you do; and this will expo&s;e you to their cen&s;ures. Yet more particularly; In your <HI>E&s;&s;ayes to Do Good,</HI> you may happen to be concerned with Per&s;ons, who&s;e <HI>Power</HI> is greater than their <HI>Vertue.</HI> It may be <HI>Needful</HI> as well as <HI>Lawful,</HI> for you, to molli|fy them, with Acknowledgments of tho&s;e things in them which may render them <HI>Honourable</HI> or <HI>Con&s;iderable,</HI> and forbear to take Notice at the
<PB N="ix" REF="001460_0010_0FB349A149066CC0">
pre&s;ent, of what may be <HI>Culpable.</HI> In this, you may aim at nothing under Heaven, but only, that you may be the more Able to <HI>Do Good</HI> unto <HI>them;</HI> or by <HI>Them</HI> to <HI>Do Good</HI> unto others. And yet, if you are not very wary, this your <HI>Civility</HI> may prove your <HI>Di&s;advantage:</HI> E&s;pecially, if you find your &s;elves obliged, either to change your <HI>Opinion</HI> of the Per&s;ons, or to tax any <HI>Mi&s;|carriage</HI> in them. The Inju&s;tice of the Cen&s;ures upon you, may be much, as if <HI>Paul</HI> rebuking <HI>Felix</HI> for his <HI>Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Uncha&s;tity,</HI> &s;hould have been twitted with it, as an <HI>Incon&s;tancy,</HI> and <HI>Incon&s;i&s;tency,</HI> in that very lately he had comple|mented this very <HI>Felix,</HI> and &s;aid, He way very glad he had One of &s;uch Abilities and Accom|pli&s;hments to be concerned withal, and one &s;o well acquainted with the affairs of his Nation. But you mu&s;t not be <HI>Unea&s;y,</HI> if you &s;hould be thus unju&s;tly dealt withal. <HI>Jerom</HI> had written highly, of <HI>Origen,</HI> as a Man of bright Endow|ments; Anon he wrote as hardly again&s;t &s;ome things that <HI>Origen</HI> was (it may be, wrongfully) accu&s;ed of. They cried out upon <HI>Jerom</HI> for his <HI>Levity,</HI> yea, <HI>Fal&s;ity.</HI> He de&s;pi&s;ed the calumny, and reply'd; <HI>I did once commend, what I thought was Great in him; and now condemn what I find to be Evil in him.</HI> I Pray, where's the contradicti|on! I Say, Be cautious; But I &s;ay again, Be not <HI>Unea&s;y.</HI></P>
<P>What I add unto it, is; That you mu&s;t be above all <HI>Di&s;couragements.</HI> Look for
<PB N="x" REF="001460_0011_0FB349A29E9F2C20">
them, and with a magnanimous <HI>Courage</HI> over|look them.</P>
<P>Some have Ob&s;erved, That the mo&s;t <HI>Concealed,</HI> and yet the mo&s;t <HI>Violent,</HI> of all our <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> u&s;u|ally is that of <HI>Idlene&s;s.</HI> It layes <HI>Adamantine Chains</HI> of Death and of Darkne&s;s upon us. It holds in <HI>Chains</HI> that cannot be &s;haken off, all our other, tho' never &s;o Impetuous Inclinations. That no more <HI>Hurt</HI> is done in the World, is very much owing to a Sort of <HI>Scorbutick</HI> and <HI>Sponta|neous</HI> La&s;&s;itude on the Minds of men, as well as that no more <HI>Good</HI> is done. A <HI>Pharaoh</HI> will do us no wrong if he tell us, <HI>Ye are Idle, ye are I|dle.</HI> We have u&s;ually more <HI>Strength</HI> to <HI>Do Good,</HI> than we have <HI>Will</HI> to lay it out. Sirs, <HI>Be up, and be Doing!</HI> Tis too &s;oon yet &s;ure for an <HI>Hic Situs e&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>If you meet with vile <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> from tho&s;e whom you have laid under the mo&s;t <HI>Weighty Obligations;</HI> Don't wonder at it. Such a <HI>Turpitude</HI> is the Nature of man &s;unk into, that men had rather bear any <HI>Weight</HI> than that of <HI>Obligations.</HI> They will own &s;mall ones; but return wonderful Hatred and Malice for &s;uch as are Extraordinary. They will render it a <HI>Dan|gerous</HI> Thing, to be very <HI>Charitable</HI> and <HI>Beneficent. Communities</HI> will do it as well as <HI>Individuals. Exce&s;s</HI> of <HI>De&s;ert</HI> at length turns into a kind of <HI>De|merit.</HI> Men will &s;ooner Forgive Great <HI>Injuries,</HI> than Great <HI>Services.</HI> He that built a Matchle&s;s Ca&s;tle for the <HI>Poles,</HI> for his <HI>Reward,</HI> had his <HI>Eyes put out,</HI> that he might not build &s;uch another.

Such Things are enough to make one <HI>Sick of the World;</HI> but, my Friend, they &s;hould not make thee <HI>Sick</HI> of <HI>E&s;&s;ayes to do Good in the World.</HI> A <HI>Conformity</HI> to thy Saviour, and a <HI>Communion</HI> with Him, Let that carry thee through all!</P>

<P><HI>O my Glorious Judge, Thou ha&s;t been my Sacrifice, Oh! Judge of all the Earth, Give Poor Dust and A&s;hes Leave to Say, My Righteou&s;ne&s;s is on the Bench.

<P>The <HI>Judge</HI> proceeds;</P>
<P><HI>But what ha&s;t thou to Plead, That thy Faith &s;hould not be Rejected, as the Faith and Hope of the Hypocrite?</HI></P>
<P>Here the Plea mu&s;t be;</P>
<P><HI>Lord, My Faith was thy Work. It was a Faith which di&s;po&s;ed me to all the Good Works of thy Holy Religion. My Faith Sanctified me. It carried me to thee, O my Saviour, for Grace to do the Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. It Embraced thee for my Lord as well as for my Saviour. It cau&s;ed me with Sincerity to Love and Keep thy Commandments; with a&s;&s;i|duity to Serve the Intere&s;ts of thy Kingdom in the World.</HI> Thus you have <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>James</HI> Reconciled. Thus you have <HI>Good Works</HI> provided for.

<PB N="38" REF="001460_0039_0FB349CFD96D8D50">
what they are <HI>within.</HI> But there is yet a further Con&s;ideration, upon which you mu&s;t be <HI>Zealou&s;ly Affected</HI> for them. You mu&s;t Con&s;ider <HI>Good Works,</HI> as the <HI>Way</HI> to, yea, as a <HI>Part</HI> of, the <HI>Great Salvation,</HI> which is Purcha&s;ed and Intended for you, by your Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. Without an <HI>Holy Heart</HI> you can't be fit for an <HI>Holy Heaven; Meet for the Inheritance of the Holy Ones</HI> in that <HI>Light,</HI> which admits no <HI>works of Darkne&s;s;</HI> where none but <HI>Good Works</HI> are done for Eternal Ages. But an <HI>Holy Heart</HI> will cau&s;e a man to do <HI>Good works</HI> with all his Heart. The Motto on the Gates of the Holy City is; <HI>None but the Lovers of Good Works to enter here.</HI> Tis im|plied, in what we read, <HI>Without Holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> Yea, to be <HI>Saved</HI> without <HI>Good works,</HI> were to be <HI>Saved</HI> without <HI>Salvation.</HI> Much of our <HI>Salvation</HI> lies in doing of <HI>Good works.</HI> When our <HI>Souls</HI> are <HI>Enlarged</HI> and <HI>Unfetter'd,</HI> it is that we may <HI>Do</HI> &s;uch Things. <HI>Heaven</HI> is begun upon <HI>Earth</HI> in the doing of them. Doubtle&s;s, no man &s;hall come up to <HI>Heaven,</HI> who is not &s;o per|&s;waded. I will mention but one more of tho&s;e <HI>Principles,</HI> which <HI>Good works</HI> grow upon. Tis that Noble one, of GRATITUDE. The Believer cannot but Enquire, <HI>What &s;hall I render to my Sa|viour?</HI> The Re&s;ult of the Enquiry will be, <HI>with Good works to Glorify Him.</HI> We read, <HI>Faith works by Love.</HI> Our <HI>Faith</HI> will fir&s;t &s;how us the Match|le&s;s and Marvellous <HI>Love</HI> of God, in Saving us.

<P>The&s;e, The&s;e are to be our Di&s;po&s;itions;</P>
<P><HI>O my Saviour; Hast thou done &s;o much for me? Now will I do all I can for thy Kingdom, and People in the World? Oh! What Service is there that I may now do for my Sa|viour, and for His People in the World!</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the Principles to be proceeded on. And on them, I will ob&s;erve to you a Notable Thing. Tis worthy of Ob&s;ervations, That there are no men in the World, who &s;o abound in <HI>Good works,</HI> as the men who have mo&s;t of all a|bandoned all pretence to <HI>Merit</HI> by their <HI>works.</HI> There are <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> who have out-done <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> in our Days, as well as in Dr. <HI>Willets.</HI> No <HI>Merit-Mongers</HI> have gone beyond &s;ome Holy Chri&s;tians, who have done <HI>Good works,</HI> upon the <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> of their being already Ju&s;tified and Entitled unto Life Eternal.</P>
<P>I take Notice, that our Apo&s;tle, ca&s;ting a Ju&s;t Contempt on the <HI>Endle&s;s Genealogies,</HI> and Long, Intricate, Perplexed Pedigrees, which the <HI>Jews</HI> of his Time, &s;tood &s;o much upon; Propo&s;es in|&s;tead thereof to be Studied, <HI>Charity, out of a Pure Heart, and a Good Con&s;cience, and Faith Unfeigned.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, I will give you a <HI>Genealogy</HI> worth Ten Thou&s;and of theirs, Fir&s;t, From <HI>Faith Unfeigned</HI> proceeds a <HI>Good Con&s;cience:</HI> From a <HI>Good Con&s;cience</HI> proceeds a <HI>Pure Heart:</HI> From a <HI>Pure Heart</HI> proceeds a <HI>Charity</HI> to all about us.

<P>In moving for the <HI>Devices</HI> of <HI>Good Neighbour|hood,</HI> a principal motion which I have to make, is; That you Con&s;ult the <HI>Spiritual</HI> Intere&s;ts of your Neighbourhood, as well as the <HI>Temporal.</HI> Be concerned, Left the <HI>Deceitfulne&s;s of Sin</HI> undo any of the Neighbours.

<P>If any <HI>Children</HI> in the Neighbourhood, are un|der no Education, don't allow 'em to continue &s;o, Let care be taken, that they may be better Edu|cated; and be taught to Read; and be taught their <HI>Catechi&s;m;</HI> and the Truths and Wayes of their only Saviour.</P>

<P>That my PROPOSAL <HI>To Do Good in the Neigh|bourhood, and as a Neighbour,</HI> may be more fully formed and followed; I will conclude it, with minding you, That a World of <HI>Self-Denial</HI> is to be Exerci&s;ed in the Execution of it.

<P>But then, there is yet an Higher Thing to be demanded, That is; <HI>Do Good</HI> unto tho&s;e Neigh|bours who have <HI>Done Hurt</HI> unto you.

PROPOSAL, has been &s;o Little hearkened un|to, 'tis Lamentable, 'tis Admirable! But &mdash; <HI>They all Slumbred and Slept.</HI></P>
<P>There is another PROPOSAL, which has been tendered to all our Churches, and attended in Some of them.</P>
<P><Q>That the &s;everal Churches, having in an <HI>In&s;tru|ment</HI> Proper for that Purpo&s;e, made a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of &s;uch things, as can indi&s;putably be found ami&s;s a|mong them, do with all Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Solemnity pa&s;s their VOTES, That they count &s;uch things to be very <HI>Offen&s;ive Evils,</HI> and that Renouncing all De|pendence on their own Strength, to avoid &s;uch Evils, they humbly Ask the Help of the <HI>Divine Grace,</HI> to A&s;&s;i&s;t them in Watching again&s;t the &s;aid Evils, both in Them&s;elves and in One another. And that the <HI>Communicants</HI> do often Reflect upon tho&s;e their <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;tations,</HI> as Perpetual <HI>Monitors</HI> unto them, to prevent the Mi&s;carriages wherewith too many Profe&s;&s;ors are too Ea&s;ily over|taken.</Q></P>
<P>It has been con&s;idered, That &s;uch humble <HI>Recognitions of Duty,</HI> will not only be Accepted by our God, as our <HI>Declarations</HI> for Him, where|upon He will Declare for us; but al&s;o, they are the <HI>Way of the New Covenant,</HI> for our obtaining of Help to do our Duty. &mdash;</P>
<P>A Particular <HI>Church,</HI> may be an illu&s;trious <HI>Pillar of Truth,</HI> by con&s;idering what Labouring <HI>Truth,</HI> and <HI>Part</HI> of the Kingdom of God, may call for Special, Signal, Open <HI>Te&s;timonies;</HI> and they may Excite their <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> to the com|po&s;ing, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the Publi&s;hing, of &s;uch

<HI>Te&s;timonies;</HI> and appear to accompany them in the Action. It is likely, that God would ac|company &s;uch <HI>Te&s;timonies</HI> with a marvellous Effi|cacy to Suppre&s;s growing <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Evils!</HI></P>
<P>A PROPOSAL of this Nature may be wor|thy of &s;ome Con&s;ideration.</P>
<Q><P N="1">I.

<P N="2">II.

And let nothing be drawn out of it, without the Knowledge and Con&s;ent of the <HI>Church,</HI> to which it belongs.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III</HI> The Fir&s;t and Main Intention of this <HI>Evan|gelical Trea&s;ury,</HI> is to be. <HI>The Propagation of Re|ligion.</HI> And therefore, when any E&s;&s;ayes of Good are to be made upon <HI>&V;ngo&s;pellized Places,</HI> the Neigh|bouring Mini&s;ters may Advi&s;e each of the Churches, what <HI>Proportion</HI> they may allow out of their <HI>Evan|gelical Trea&s;ury,</HI> towards the Support of &s;uch a noble undertaking.</P>

They did after the Example of <HI>Solomon,</HI> Study <HI>Bota|nicks:</HI> They had their <HI>Apothecaries</HI> who were to furni&s;h them with <HI>Materials</HI> for Medicines.

<HEAD>An Appendix; Concerning the ESSAYS that are made, for the <HI>Propagation of Religion</HI> among the Indians, in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et</HI>-Province of NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been de&s;ired, That our Book of <HI>E&s;&s;ays to do Good,</HI> may give an Account, of Some that are actually Pur&s;ued, on One of the mo&s;t important Articles that have been propo&s;ed. The occa&s;ion for this De&s;ire, has been given by &s;ome odd In&s;inuati|ons made by &s;ome who expre&s;s a Zeal for, <HI>The Propa|gation of Religion,</HI> as if nothing had been done that way, by any People of our Profe&s;&s;ion, who readily own, <Q>That we are for Embracing &amp; Diffu&s;ing the Holy Re|ligion of CHRIST, in the <HI>Original Purity</HI> wherein His Go&s;pel has given it unto us, without Humane <HI>Additions</HI> &amp; <HI>Inventions.</HI></Q> Tis true, We have cau&s;e al|wayes to blame our &s;elves for our own <HI>Deficiencies</HI> in &s;uch a Work of God. And if we give an Account of what we have done, it mu&s;t be with an Holy Shame that we have <HI>done &s;o little. Pride,</HI> and, <HI>Vain-glorious O&s;tentation,</HI> Be thou at all po&s;&s;ible Di&s;tance from the <HI>Relation,</HI> which our concern to have the Grace of God acknowledged, and a well-De&s;igning Society of Good Men defended from Injurious Imputations, has com|pelled us to communicate unto the World.</P>
<P>It &s;hall be done with all the <HI>Modesty</HI> and <HI>Brevity</HI> that the matter will allow of.</P>
<P>In the Book Entituled, <HI>Magnalia Chri&s;ti Americana,</HI> or, <HI>The Hi&s;tory of</HI> NEW-ENGLAND, there is a large
<PB N="195" REF="001460_0196_0FB34C57A8D2DDE0">
Account of what was <HI>formerly done,</HI> for the Chri&s;tiani|zing of our <HI>Indians.</HI> Thither we refer the Reader, for all that was <HI>formerly done:</HI> which when he Reads, he will certainly wi&s;h for more ELIOT's in the World. <HI>The pre&s;ent State of Chri&s;tianity</HI> among them, is what mu&s;t now be Reported.</P>
<P>The Number of <HI>Indians</HI> in this Land, is not compa|rable to what it was, in the middle of the former Cen|tury. The Wars which after an Offered and Rejected Go&s;pel, they perfidiou&s;ly began upon the Engli&s;h, a|bove Thirty years ago, brought a Quick De&s;olation upon whole Nations of them. All that remain under the Engli&s;h Influences in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et</HI>-Province, are generally recovered out of their Pagani&s;m, to &s;ome &s;en&s;e of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI></P>
<P>The Chri&s;tianized Indians on the two I&s;lands of <HI>Martha's</HI> Vinyard, and <HI>Nantucket</HI> make a very con&s;i|derable Body. At <HI>Martha's</HI> Vinyard and <HI>El&s;abeth</HI>'s I&s;lands, there are Ten Congregations, in which a glo|rious CHRIST is wor&s;hipped. There are Two Eng|li&s;hmen, and Ten Indians, that are Preachers to them, in their own Language. They have <HI>Schools</HI> al&s;o, in which their Children are taught to Read and Write; and know the Catechi&s;m. At <HI>Nantucket,</HI> there are at lea&s;t Three Congregations; and more than as many Preachers.</P>
<P>From the&s;e <HI>I&s;lands</HI> we will pa&s;s to the adjacent <HI>Con|tinent,</HI> Where a careful Enquiry has been lately made, in a <HI>Vi&s;itation</HI> ordered for that purpo&s;e by the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for &s;uch affairs. The Re&s;ult of the En|quiry was, That there are between Twenty &amp; Thirty Congregations of <HI>Chri&s;tianized Indians,</HI> here on the <HI>Main;</HI> whereto there belong near Three Thou&s;and Souls. Here are Ten Engli&s;h Preachers, who give them their In&s;tructions and A&s;&s;i&s;tences, and Preach un|to them, either on the <HI>Lords dayes,</HI> or in appointed
<PB N="196" REF="001460_0197_0FB34C5CE9A73928">
<HI>Lectures.</HI> There are al&s;o between Twenty &amp; Thirty <HI>Indian</HI> Teachers, by whom the Exerci&s;es of the <HI>Lords-dayes</HI> are mo&s;tly managed. They have in &s;everal of the&s;e Villages on the <HI>Main,</HI> al&s;o made hand&s;ome Sub|&s;criptions of their own, towards the Building of <HI>Meet|ing-Hou&s;es;</HI> wherein the Engli&s;h likewi&s;e have helped them. They have the whole <HI>Bible</HI> in their own Lan|guage; which has been here twice Printed for them. This <HI>Great Light</HI> has been <HI>Satellited,</HI> with other Books which we have al&s;o printed for them, in their own Language. Their Library is continually growing, by <HI>New Books,</HI> wherewith we Serve and Suit the Intere&s;ts of Chri&s;tianity among them, from time to time, as we &s;ee occa&s;ion. And their <HI>Schools</HI> are multiplying. <HI>Family-Prayer</HI> al&s;o is frequently upheld among them. And their <HI>Marriages</HI> are u&s;ually celebrated according to the Directions left by the famous ELIOT, who&s;e Name &s;till is of much Authority with them.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Congregations of <HI>Indians,</HI> which are not advanced unto all the Priviledges of the <HI>Evan|gelical Church-State;</HI> not yet combining for, and En|joying of, all <HI>Special Ordinances.</HI> Yet a con&s;iderable Number of them are &s;o; and &s;ome <HI>New Churches</HI> have been lately form'd and fill'd among them.</P>
<P>The performances in the ordinary Congregations of the <HI>Indians,</HI> have been often &s;uch, that there are very many Engli&s;h Witne&s;&s;es, who have not a little admired at the Gravity, the Attention, the Affection expre&s;&s;ed in them. The pertinent <HI>Prayers</HI> (and, <HI>Sine Monitore, quia de Pectore,</HI>) the Orthodox <HI>Sermons,</HI> (at the Hear|ing whereof, the very Children of a dozen years old will readily turn to the Proofs,) and the Singing of <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> with a Melody out-doing many of the Engli&s;h, in their Meetings, have been frequently ob&s;erved with Admiration. To &s;ee &s;uch forlorn Salvages, and the mo&s;t ruteful Ruines of Mankind, not only <HI>Cicurated</HI>
<PB N="197" REF="001460_0198_0FB34C5F48D29738">
into &s;ome Civility, but al&s;o <HI>Elevated</HI> unto &s;o much Knowledge and Practice of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> has to &s;ome appeared an amiable and admirable Spectacle!</P>
<P>In their Churches, they have <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Elders</HI> of their own; <HI>Ordained,</HI> Sometimes by the Hands of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters; and &s;ometimes by the Hands of the <HI>Indian</HI> Mini&s;ters, in the Pre&s;ence of the Engli&s;h; All after the Solemn Engli&s;h manner. And by <HI>Ad|monitions</HI> and <HI>Excommunications</HI> Publickly di&s;pen&s;ed, they proceed again&s;t Scandalous Offendors: for which Intent, and that they may &s;ea&s;onably Find and Heal all <HI>Scandals,</HI> they hold a <HI>Church-Meeting</HI> the Week be|fore every Communion.</P>
<P>One that is at this Time, a Pious and Faithful Eng|li&s;h Mini&s;ter, but Preaching al&s;o to the <HI>Indians,</HI> has given in unto us, this Te&s;timony.</P>
<P><Q>Their Gravity, and diligent Attendance in the Time of Wor&s;hip, with the affectionate Confe&s;&s;ions of &s;uch as are Admitted, into the Church, make me hope, that many of them may have the Work of the Spirit wrought in them, <HI>according to the working of the mighty Power of God.</HI> Their Method, re&s;pecting tho&s;e that are Admit|ted into their Communion, is more according to the manner of the Churches in the Primitive Times, than is now practi&s;ed among the Chur|ches in mo&s;t Parts. The Per&s;on to be Admit|ted, &s;tands forth in the mid&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly; and fir&s;t makes a <HI>Declaration</HI> of his <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and &s;ometimes de&s;ires <HI>Information</HI> in things more ar|duous and doubtful. And then, he makes a <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin;</HI> which they do, (as I have &s;een) with <HI>Tears</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> like him in the
<PB N="198" REF="001460_0199_0FB34A2889E6D210">
<HI>Sixteenth</HI> Chapter of the <HI>Acts.</HI> And then he gives an Account of <HI>Experiences</HI> he has had, of Convictions, Awakenings, and Comforts; in which they are large and particular. After which (much Coun&s;el and Exhortation, to re|main &s;tedfa&s;t in the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Wayes</HI> of the Lord, being given them, by their <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Elder</HI>) they are Admitted. I would, (and not un|groundedly) hope, That <HI>Additions</HI> are <HI>made unto the Church daily of &s;uch as &s;hall be Saved.</HI> There are many, which maintain a Chri&s;tian Conver&s;ation, and are to be accounted, not <HI>Almo&s;t,</HI> but <HI>Altogether Chri&s;tians.</HI> And this does Encourage the Preaching of the Go&s;pel to them; when we &s;ee, it plea&s;es God to make it, <HI>His Power unto Salvation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, we can do nothing for tho&s;e Bloody Salvages in the <HI>Ea&s;tern Parts,</HI> who have been taught by the <HI>French Priests,</HI> That the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was a <HI>French</HI> Lady, and that our Great Saviour was a <HI>French|man,</HI> and that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Murdered Him, and that He Ro&s;e from the Dead, &amp; is taken up to the Heavens, but that all that would recommend them&s;elves to His Fa|vour, mu&s;t Revenge His Quarrel on the Engli&s;h Peo|ple; which i&s;&s;uing out from their Indi&s;coverable Swamps, they have often done with cruel Depredati|ons. When we have had the &s;hort Re&s;pites of a Truce with them, we have made &s;everal New At|tempts to carry them the Tenders of a <HI>Glorious Go&s;pel;</HI> but they have pre&s;ently broke out into Fre&s;h Ho&s;tilities, which have put an End unto all Good Expectations concerning them.</P>
<P>There has been <HI>Something done</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;tianize</HI> the <HI>Mohegins,</HI> and other Indians, in the Colony of <HI>Con|necticut;</HI>
<PB N="199" REF="001460_0200_0FB34A2526CE6ED8">
but, <HI>Lord, who has believed!</HI> They have been ob&s;tinate in their Pagani&s;m; however their ob&s;tinacy has not put an End unto our Endeavours.</P>
<P>An Exemplary Indian Mini&s;ter, who&s;e Name is <HI>Japhet,</HI> has of late years made &s;everal Salleyes, among his Pagan Country-men, about the <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI>-Coun|trey; and the <HI>Hand of the Lord has been with him,</HI> and many <HI>have Believed, and turned unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>We have made many Trials, to make the <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> of the Go&s;pel, reach unto the Five Nations, that are &s;ome Hundreds of Miles di&s;tant from us, to the We&s;tward. All that is yet accompli&s;hed, is, To Sup|port and Reward the pains of &s;everal <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ters, who proceed as far as they well can, that the&s;e may no longer be &s;uch <HI>Fooli&s;h Nations;</HI> and have &s;een &s;ome comfortable Succe&s;&s;es of their Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The Principal concern for the Indians in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;et</HI>-Province, is to Pre&s;erve and Improve the <HI>Chri&s;ti|anity</HI> already Profe&s;&s;ed among them, and Prevent the lo&s;s of a <HI>Noble Work</HI> by &s;ome Degeneracies, which have no very well boding A&s;pect upon it: E&s;pecially, to Prevent the Fatal Effects, with which the <HI>Bottel</HI> threatens it. In order hereto, various Methods are u&s;ed continually, to keep a Watchful In&s;pection on their Manners, and to make what Progre&s;s we can in <HI>Anglici&s;ing</HI> of them. The&s;e things are in the <HI>Practice</HI> Encumbred with Difficulties, beyond what can be by mo&s;t men in the bare <HI>Theory</HI> imagined. But the <HI>Com|mi&s;&s;ioners</HI> here Entru&s;ted, for the management of that Affayr, continually Con&s;ult and Pur&s;ue, what may be mo&s;t Sub&s;ervient unto the Grand Intention.</P>

<P><PB N="201" REF="001460_0202_0FB34A299F2ADDD8">Many years after this, the admirable <HI>Wit&s;ius</HI> comforts us with a Pa&s;&s;age of an ob&s;ervable A&s;pect that way; <Q><HI>Neque profecto officio hic &s;uo defuerunt Illu&s;tres Animae.</HI>&mdash;There have not bees wanting tho&s;e Illu&s;trious Men, who have ob&s;erved all the Solid Di&s;coveries in <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> all the curi|ous Re&s;earches of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> or that has occured in <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> or in <HI>Law,</HI> relating to the <HI>Sacred Scriptures,</HI> and have applyed it all with a Signal Dexterity to the <HI>Illu&s;tration</HI> thereof; And &s;o 'tis come to pa&s;s, that <HI>Theology,</HI> which had va&s;t Riches of its own before, is now al&s;o Enriched with foreign <HI>Spoiles,</HI> and appears with tho&s;e Ornaments, which Extort, even from them that are mo&s;t of all di&s;affected unto it, a confe&s;&s;ion of its mo&s;t charming Maje&s;ty.</Q></P>
<P>The Noble Service to Mankind, thus pro|pounded, having been &s;o far Pur&s;ued, it is ea&s;y to imagine, that a Per&s;on of but common Abi|lities, applying him&s;elf unto it, might accompli&s;h a very <HI>Rich Collection of Illu&s;trations,</HI> upon the glo|rious <HI>Book of Truth and of Life.</HI> It may not be a|mi&s;s, but the Treati&s;e now in our Hands may very agreeably do it, that the Friends of Learn|ing and Religion be now <HI>Adverti&s;ed,</HI> of a Moderate Performance, which by the Help of Heaven, has been produced, of &s;uch a Tendency.</P>
<P>No little part of what has been Written on the Great Intention of <HI>Illu&s;trating the Divine Oracles,</HI> has been peru&s;ed. Some Hundreds of the <HI>Late&s;t,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Olde&s;t</HI> Writers, that have had any
<PB N="202" REF="001460_0203_0FB34A2B1F2432D0">
thing Looking that way, have been con&s;ulted. Many Thou&s;ands of their <HI>Fine&s;t Thoughts</HI> have been found out, Extracted, &amp; Dige&s;ted. The <HI>Eye</HI> of the Authors Indu&s;try, has not yet <HI>Seen every Precious Thing;</HI> yet it has often, in the three Lu&s;tres of years, which have ran &s;ince he began his Undertaking, <HI>Vi&s;ited the Place of Sapphires,</HI> and <HI>found the Dust of Gold,</HI> which is here Expo&s;ed un|to the Refined part of Mankind, when it &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e to accept thereof. And there are Two Competent Volumns of the choice&s;t <HI>Illu&s;tra|tions,</HI> (in <HI>folio</HI>) now lying ready for Publi|cation.</P>
<P>The Work interferes not at all, with the Two very valuable Volumns of the POLAN <HI>Annota|tions;</HI> but may ask for it, as an agreeable Ho|nour, to attend upon them.</P>
<P>It is hoped, That all Impartial Chri&s;tians, of whatever Denomination or Subdivi&s;ion in Chri&s;tianity, will e&s;teem it, <HI>An u&s;eful Work;</HI> For it mu&s;t needs be &s;o, if the Books, from which the <HI>Be&s;t Things</HI> are fetch'd, and laid here together, were &s;o.</P>
<P>To be&s;tow the cen&s;ure of <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Vanity,</HI> on the Propo&s;ing of &s;uch a Work for Publication, would be there-with to Reproach all Attempts in &s;uch a way to Serve the Publick. 'Tis no Tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t the Rules of <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> (but it would look like one again&s;t the Rules of <HI>Equity</HI> to call it &s;o,) to give the Publick, a Report, and a Tender, of what has been thus Prepared. It

is a <HI>Lawful</HI> and a <HI>Mode&s;t</HI> thing, for a Man to De&s;ire, that &s;o much of a Short Life, as has been Spent in &s;uch a Preparation, &s;hould not be <HI>Spent in vain.</HI></P>
<P>The Author Lives in Daily Expectation of his Death; But he Dies with &s;ome Hope, that the Glorious Head of the Church, will &s;tir up &s;ome generous Minds, to forward an Undertaking So Confe&s;&s;edly Worthy to be Pro&s;ecuted.</P>
