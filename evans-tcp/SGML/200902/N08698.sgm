<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>MY mind hath often been affected with &s;orrow, on account of the prevailing of that &s;pirit, which leads from an humble waiting on the inward teaching of Chri&s;t, to pur&s;ue ways of living, attended with un|nece&s;&s;ary labour, and which draws forth the minds of many people to &s;eek after outward power, and to &s;trive for riches, which fre|quently introduce oppre&s;&s;ion, and bring forth wars and grievous calamities.</P>
<P>It is with reverence that I acknowledge the mercies of our heavenly Father, who, in infinite love, did vi&s;it me in my youth, and wrought a belief in me, that through true obedience a &s;tate of inward purity may be known in this life, in which we may love mankind in the &s;ame love with which our Redeemer loveth us, and therein learn re&s;ignation to endure hard&s;hips, for the real good of others.</P>
<P><HI>While the eye is &s;ingle, the whole body is full of light,</HI> Matt. vi. 22; but for want of this, &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ires, and an imaginary &s;uperiority,
<PB N="4" REF="011124_0003_0F85366B506A7808">darken the mind; hence inju&s;tice frequently proceeds; and where this is the ca&s;e, to convince the judgment, is the mo&s;t effectual remedy.</P>
<P>Where violent mea&s;ures are pur&s;ued in oppo&s;ing inju&s;tice, the pa&s;&s;ions, and re&s;ent|ments, of the injured, frequently operate in the pro&s;ecution of their de&s;igns; and after conflicts productive of very great calamities, the minds of contending parties often re|main as little acquainted with the pure prin|ciple of divine love, as they were before; but where people walk in that pure light in which all their <HI>works are wrought in God,</HI> John iii. 21, and under oppre&s;&s;ion per&s;evere in the meek &s;pirit, and abide firm in the cau&s;e of truth, without actively complying with oppre&s;&s;ive demands, through tho&s;e the Lord hath often manife&s;ted his power, in opening the under&s;tandings of others, to the promoting righteou&s;ne&s;s in the earth.</P>
<P>A time, I believe, is coming, wherein this divine work will &s;o &s;pread and prevail, that <HI>Nation &s;hall not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, nor learn war any more,</HI> I&s;aiah ii. And as we, through the tender mercies of God, do feel that this precious work is be|gun, I am concerned to encourage my bre|thren and &s;i&s;ters in a holy care and diligence,
<PB N="5" REF="011124_0004_0F85366C0C40D358">that each of us may &s;o live, under the &s;anc|tifying power of truth, as to be redeemed from all unnece&s;&s;ary cares; that our eye be|ing &s;ingle to him, no cu&s;toms, however pre|valent, which are contrary to the wi&s;dom from above, may hinder us from faithfully following his holy leadings, in what&s;oever he may graciou&s;ly appoint for us.</P>

<HEAD><HI>On</HI> PURE WISDOM, <HI>and</HI> HUMAN POLICY.</HEAD>
<P>_TO have our tru&s;t &s;ettled in the Lord, and not to &s;eek after, nor de&s;ire outward trea&s;ures, any further than his holy &s;pirit leads us therein, is a happy &s;tate, as &s;aith the prophet, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that tru&s;teth in the Lord, and who&s;e hope the Lord is.</HI></P>
<P>Pure wi&s;dom leads people into lowline&s;s of mind, in which they learn re&s;ignation to the divine will, and contentment in &s;uffer|ing for his cau&s;e, when they cannot keep a clear con&s;cience without &s;uffering.</P>
<P>In this pure wi&s;dom the mind is attentive to the root, and original &s;pring of motions and de&s;ires, and as we know <HI>the Lord to be our refuge,</HI> and find no &s;afety, but in hum|bly walking before him, we feel an holy engagement, that every de&s;ire which leads therefrom may be brought to judgment.</P>
<P>While we proceed in this precious way, and find arden longings for a full deliver|ance <PB N="8" REF="011124_0006_0F85366DA701F258">from every thing which defiles, all pro&s;pects of gain, that are not con&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom from above, are con&s;idered as &s;nares, and an inward concern is felt, that we may live under the cro&s;s, and faith|fully attend to that holy &s;pirit, which is &s;uf|ficient to pre&s;erve out of them.</P>
<P>When I have con&s;idered that &s;aying of Chri&s;t, Matt. vi. 19, <HI>Lay not up for your|&s;elves trea&s;ures upon earth,</HI> his omnipotence hath often occurred to my mind.</P>
<P>While we believe that he is every where pre&s;ent with his people, and that perfect goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom and power, are united in him, how comfortable is the con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Our wants may be great, but his power is greater. We may be oppre&s;&s;ed and de|&s;pi&s;ed, but he is able to turn our patient &s;uf|ferings into profit to our&s;elves, and to the advancement of his work on earth. His people, who feel the power of his cro&s;s, to crucify all that is &s;elfi&s;h in them, who are engaged in outward concerns, from a con|vincement that it is their duty, and re&s;ign them&s;elves, and their trea&s;ures, to him; the&s;e feel that it is dangerous to give way to that in us, which craves riches and greatne&s;s in this world.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="011124_0007_0F85366E446AFB40">
As the heart truly contrite, earne&s;tly de|&s;ires <HI>to know Chri&s;t, and the fellow&s;hip of his &s;ufferings,</HI> Phil. iii. 10, &s;o far as the Lord for gracious <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">nds may lead into them; as &s;uch feel that it is their intere&s;t to put their tru&s;t in God, and to &s;eek no gain but that which he, by his holy &s;pirit, leads into; &s;o, on the contrary, they who do not reverently wait for this divine teacher, and are not humbly concerned, according to their mea|&s;ure, <HI>to fill up that which is behind of the af|flictions of Chri&s;t,</HI> Col. i. 24, in patiently &s;uffering for the promoting righteou&s;ne&s;s in the earth; but have an eye toward the pow|er of men, and the outward advantage of wealth, the&s;e are often attentive to tho&s;e employments which appear profitable, even though the gains ari&s;e from &s;uch trade and bu&s;ine&s;s which proceeds from the workings of that &s;pirit, which is e&s;tranged from the &s;elf-denying life of an humble contrite Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>While I write on this &s;ubject, I feel my mind tenderly affected toward tho&s;e hone&s;tly di&s;po&s;ed people, who have been brought up in employments attended with tho&s;e dif|ficulties.</P>
<P>To &s;uch I may &s;ay, in the feeling of our heavenly Father's love, and number my&s;elf
<PB N="10" REF="011124_0008_0F85366F42924F58">with you, O that our eyes may be &s;ingle to the Lord! may we reverently wait on him for &s;trength, to lay a&s;ide all unnece&s;&s;ary ex|pence of every kind, and learn contentment, in a plain &s;imple life.</P>
<P>May we, in lowline&s;s, &s;ubmit to the lead|ings of his &s;pirit, and enter upon any out|ward employ which he graciou&s;ly points out to us, and then whatever difficulties ari&s;e, in con&s;equence of our faithfulne&s;s, I tru&s;t they will work for our good.</P>
<P>Small trea&s;ure to a re&s;igned mind is &s;uf|ficient. How happy is it to be content with a little, to live in humility, and feel that in us, which breathes out this language, Abba! Father.</P>
<P>If that, called the wi&s;dom of this world, had no re&s;emblance of true wi&s;dom, the name of wi&s;dom, I &s;uppo&s;e, had not been given to it.</P>
<P>As wa&s;ting outward &s;ub&s;tance, to gratify vain de&s;ires, on one hand; &s;o &s;lothfulne&s;s and neglect, on the other, do often involve men and their families in trouble, and re|duce them to want and di&s;tre&s;s; to &s;hun both the&s;e oppo&s;ite vices, is good in it&s;elf, and hath a re&s;emblance of wi&s;dom; but while people thus provident, have it principally in view to get riches, and power, and the
<PB N="11" REF="011124_0009_0F85366FF69F4E90">friend&s;hip of this world, and do not humbly wait for the &s;pirit of truth to lead them in purity; the&s;e, through an anxious care to obtain the end de&s;ired, reach forth for gain in worldly wi&s;dom, and, in regard to their in|ward &s;tate, fall into divers temptations and &s;nares. And though &s;uch may think of ap|plying wealth to good purpo&s;es, and to u&s;e their power to prevent oppre&s;&s;ion, yet wealth and power is often applied otherwi&s;e; nor can we depart from the leadings of our holy &s;hepherd, without going into confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Great wealth is frequently attended with power, which nothing but divine love can qualify the mind to u&s;e rightly; and as to the humility, and uprightne&s;s of our children after us, how great is the uncertainty! If, in acquiring wealth, we take hold on the wi&s;|dom which is from beneath, and depart from the leadings of truth, and example our chil|dren herein, we have great cau&s;e to appre|hend, that wealth may be a &s;nare to them; and prove an injury to others, over whom their wealth may give them power.</P>
<P>To be redeemed from that wi&s;dom which is from beneath, and walk in the light of the Lord, is a precious &s;ituation; thus his people are brought to put their tru&s;t in him; and in this humble confidence in his wi&s;dom, good|ne&s;s <PB N="12" REF="011124_0010_0F853670C3825890">and power, the righteous find a refuge in adver&s;ities, &s;uperior to the greate&s;t out|ward helps, and a comfort more certain than any worldly advantages can afford.</P>

<HEAD><HI>On</HI> LABOUR.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING from my childhood been u&s;ed to bodily labour for a living, I may expre&s;s my experience therein.</P>
<P>Right exerci&s;e affords an innocent plea|&s;ure in the time of it, and prepares us to enjoy the &s;weetne&s;s of re&s;t; but from the ex|tremes each way, ari&s;e inconveniences.</P>
<P>Moderate exerci&s;e opens the pores, gives the blood a lively circulation, and the better enables us to judge rightly re&s;pecting that portion of labour which is the true medium.</P>
<P><HI>The fowls of the Air &s;ow not, nor gather into barns, yet our heavenly father feedeth them,</HI> Matt. vi. 26; nor do I believe that in|finite goodne&s;s and power would have al|lotted labour to us, had he not &s;een that la|bour was proper for us in this life.</P>
<P>The original de&s;ign, and true medium of labour, is a &s;ubject that, to me, appears wor|thy of our &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="011124_0011_0F853671C2305168">
Idle men are often a burden to them&s;elves, neglect the duty they owe to their families, and become burden&s;ome to others al&s;o.</P>
<P>As outward labour, directed by the wi&s;|dom from above, tends to our health, and adds to our happine&s;s in this life; &s;o, on the contrary, entering upon it in a &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit, and pur&s;uing it too long, or too hard, hath a contrary effect.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved, that too much labour not only makes the under&s;tanding dull, but &s;o intrudes upon the harmony of the body, that after cea&s;ing from our toil, we have another to pa&s;s through, before we can be &s;o com|po&s;ed as to enjoy the &s;weetne&s;s of re&s;t.</P>
<P>From too much labour in the heat, fre|quently proceeds immoderate &s;weats, which do often, I believe, open the way for di&s;|orders, and impair our con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>When we go beyond the true medium, and feel wearine&s;s approaching, but think bu&s;ine&s;s may &s;uffer if we cea&s;e, at &s;uch a time &s;pirituous liquors are frequently taken, with a view to &s;upport nature under the&s;e fatigues.</P>
<P>I have found that too much labour in the &s;ummer heats the blood, that taking &s;trong drink to &s;upport the body under &s;uch labour, increa&s;eth that heat, and though a per&s;on
<PB N="14" REF="011124_0012_0F8536720EFA9070">may be &s;o far temperate as not to manife&s;t the lea&s;t di&s;order, yet the mind, in &s;uch a circum&s;tance, doth not retain that calmne&s;s and &s;erenity which we &s;hould endeavour to live in.</P>
<P>Thus toiling in the heat, and drinking &s;trong liquor, makes men more re&s;olute, and le&s;s con&s;iderate, and tends very much to di&s;qualify from &s;ucce&s;sfully following him who is meek and low of heart.</P>
<P>As laying out bu&s;ine&s;s, more than is con|&s;i&s;tent with pure wi&s;dom, is an evil, &s;o this evil frequently leads into more. Too much bu&s;ine&s;s leads to hurry. In the hurry and toil too much &s;trong drink is often u&s;ed, and hereby many proceed to noi&s;e and wanton|ne&s;s, and &s;ome, tho' more con&s;iderate, do often &s;uffer lo&s;s, as to a true compo&s;edne&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>I feel &s;incere de&s;ires in my heart that no rent, nor intere&s;t, might be laid &s;o high as to be a &s;nare to tenants. That no de&s;ires of gain may draw any too far in bu&s;ine&s;s. That no cares to &s;upport cu&s;toms, which have not their foundation in pure wi&s;dom, may have place in our minds, but that we may build on the &s;ure foundation, and feel our holy &s;hepherd to lead us, who alone is able to pre&s;erve us, and bring forth from every thing which defiles.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="011124_0013_0F853672EF9D8B70">
Having &s;everal times, in my travels, had opportunity to ob&s;erve the labour and man|ner of life of great numbers of &s;laves, it ap|pears to me that the true medium is lamen|tably neglected by many, who a&s;&s;ign them their portion of labour.</P>
<P>Without &s;aying much at this time, con|cerning buying and &s;elling men for term of life, who have as ju&s;t a right to liberty as we have; nor about the great mi&s;eries, and ef|fu&s;ion of blood, con&s;equent to promoting the &s;lave-trade, and to &s;peak as favourably as may be, with regard to continuing tho&s;e in bondage who are among&s;t us, we cannot &s;ay there is no partiality in it; for whatever ten|derne&s;s may be manife&s;ted by individuals in their life time toward them, yet for people to be tran&s;mitted from a man to his po&s;terity, in the helple&s;s condition of &s;laves, appears incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of the go&s;pel &s;pirit. From &s;uch proceedings it often fol|lows, that per&s;ons in the decline of life, are deprived of monies equitably due to them, and committed to the care, and &s;ubjected to the ab&s;olute power of young unexperienced men, who know but little about the weak|ne&s;s of old age, nor under&s;tand the language of declining life.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="011124_0014_0F853673AC58B110">
Where parents give their e&s;tates to their chil|dren, and then depend on them for a main|tenance, they &s;ometimes meet with great in|conveniences; but if the power of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, thus obtained, doth often rever&s;e the obligations of gratitude and filial duty, and makes manife&s;t, that youth are often ignorant of the language of old age, how hard is the ca&s;e of antient Negroes, who, deprived of the wages equitably due to them, are left to young people, who have been u&s;ed to look upon them as their inferiors.</P>
<P>For men to behold the fruits of their la|bour withheld from them, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by others, and in old age find them&s;elves de|&s;titute of tho&s;e comfortable accommodations, and that tender regard which their time of life requires:</P>
<P>When they feel pains, and &s;tiffne&s;s in their joints and limbs, weakne&s;s of appetite, and that a little labour is weari&s;ome, and &s;till be|hold them&s;elves in the neglected uncomfort|able condition of a &s;lave, and oftentimes to a young un&s;ympathi&s;ing man:</P>
<P>For men to be thus treated from one ge|neration to another, who, be&s;ides their own di&s;tre&s;&s;es, think on the &s;lavery entailed on their po&s;terity, and are grieved! what di&s;|agreeable thoughts mu&s;t they have of the
<PB N="17" REF="011124_0015_0F85367455982708">profe&s;&s;ed followers of Je&s;us! and how mu&s;t their groans a&s;cend to that almighty being, who <HI>will be a refuge for the oppre&s;&s;ed,</HI> P&s;alm ix. 9.</P>

<HEAD><HI>On</HI> SCHOOLS.</HEAD>
<P>Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of &s;uch is the kingdom of God, <HI>Mark x. 14.</HI></P>
<P>To encourage children to do things with a view to get prai&s;e of men, to me appears an ob&s;truction to their being in|wardly acquainted with the &s;pirit of truth. For it is the work of the Holy Spirit to direct the mind to God, that in all our proceedings we may have a &s;ingle eye to him. To give alms in &s;ecret, to fa&s;t in &s;ecret, and labour to keep clear of that di&s;po&s;ition reproved by our Saviour, <HI>All their works which they do is for to be &s;een of men,</HI> Matt. xxiii. 5.</P>
<P>That divine light which enlightens all men, I believe, does often &s;hine in the minds of children very early, and to humbly wait for wi&s;dom, that our conduct toward them may tend to forward their acquaintance with
<PB N="18" REF="011124_0016_0F853675569EC580">it, and &s;trengthen them in obedience thereto, appears to me to be a duty on all of us.</P>
<P>By cheri&s;hing the &s;pirit of pride, and the love of prai&s;e in them, I believe they may &s;ometimes improve fa&s;ter in learning, than otherwi&s;e they would, but to take mea&s;ures to forward children in learning, which na|turally tend to divert their minds from true humility, appears to me to &s;avour of the wi&s;|dom of this world.</P>
<P>If tutors are not acquainted with &s;ancti|fication of &s;pirit, nor experienced in an humble waiting for the leadings of truth, but follow the maxims of the wi&s;dom of this world, &s;uch children who are under their tuition, appear to me to be in danger of imbibing thoughts, and apprehen&s;ions, rever&s;e to that meekne&s;s, and lowline&s;s of heart, which is nece&s;&s;ary for all the true fol|lowers of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Children at an age fit for &s;chools, are in a time of life which requires the patient at|tention of pious people, and if we commit them to the tuition of &s;uch, who&s;e minds we believe are not rightly prepared to <HI>train them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</HI> we are in danger of not acting the part of faithful parents toward them; for our heavenly father doth not require us to do
<PB N="19" REF="011124_0017_0F853675DBCB47B8">evil, that good may come of it; and it is needful that we deeply examine our&s;elves, le&s;t we get entangled in the wi&s;dom of this world, and, through wrong apprehen&s;ions, take &s;uch methods in education, as may prove a great injury to the minds of our children.</P>
<P>It is a lovely &s;ight to behold innocent children! and when they are &s;ent to &s;uch &s;chools where their tender minds are in im|minent danger of being led a&s;tray by tutors, who do not live a &s;elf-denying life, or by the conver&s;ation of &s;uch children who do not live in innocence, it is a ca&s;e much to be lamented.</P>
<P>While a pious tutor hath the charge of no more children than he can take due care of, and keeps his authority in the truth, the good &s;pirit in which he leads and governs, works on the minds of &s;uch who are not hardened, and his labours not only tend to bring them forward in outward learning, but to open their under&s;tandings with re|&s;pect to the true chri&s;tian life; but where a per&s;on hath charge of too many, and his thoughts and time are &s;o much employed in the outward affairs of his &s;chool, that he does not &s;o weightily attend to the &s;pirit and conduct of each individual, as to be enabled to admini&s;ter rightly to all in due &s;ea&s;on;
<PB N="20" REF="011124_0018_0F853676B707EFB8">through &s;uch emi&s;&s;ion he not only &s;uffers, as to the &s;tate of his own mind, but the minds of the children are in danger of &s;uffering al&s;o.</P>
<P>To watch the &s;pirit of children, to nurture them in go&s;pel love, and labour to help them again&s;t that which would mar the beauty of their minds, is a debt we owe them; and a faithful performance of our duty, not only tends to their la&s;ting benefit, and our own peace, but al&s;o to render their company agreeable to us.</P>
<P>In&s;truction, thus admini&s;tred, reaches the pure witne&s;s in the minds of &s;uch children who are not hardened, and begets love in them toward tho&s;e who thus lead them on; but where too great a number are committed to a tutor, and he, through much cumber, omits a careful attention to the minds of children, there is danger of di&s;orders gradually in|crea&s;ing among&s;t them, till the effects there|of appear in their conduct, too &s;trong to be ea&s;ily remedied.</P>
<P>A care hath lived on my mind, that more time might be employed by parents at home, and by tutors at &s;chool, in weightily attend|ing to the &s;pirit and inclinations of children, and that we may &s;o lead, in&s;truct, and go|vern them, in this tender part of life, that
<PB N="21" REF="011124_0019_0F8536774FBD4FE8">nothing may be omitted in our power, to help them on their way to become the children of our father, who is in heaven.</P>
<P>Meditating on the &s;ituation of &s;chools in our provinces, my mind hath, at times, been affected with &s;orrow, and under the&s;e exerci&s;es it hath appeared to me, that if tho&s;e who have large e&s;tates, were faithful &s;tew|ards, and laid no rent, nor intere&s;t, nor other demand, higher than is con&s;i&s;tent with univer&s;al love, and tho&s;e in lower circum|&s;tances would, under a moderate employ, &s;hun unnece&s;&s;ary expence, even to the &s;mall|e&s;t article; and all unite in humbly &s;eeking to the Lord, he would graciou&s;ly in&s;truct us, and &s;trengthen us, to relieve the youth from various &s;nares, in which many of them are entangled.</P>

<PB N="22" REF="011124_0020_0F85367813CC15B0">gratifying tho&s;e de&s;ires which are not of his begetting, tho&s;e approaches to him are ob|&s;tructed, and the deceivable &s;pirit gains &s;trength.</P>
<P>The&s;e truths, being as it were engraven upon our hearts, and our everla&s;ting intere&s;t in Chri&s;t evidently concerned herein, we become fervently engaged, that nothing may be nouri&s;hed which tends to feed pride or &s;elf-love in us. Thus in pure obedience, we are not only in&s;tructed in our duty to God, but al&s;o in the affairs which nece&s;&s;arily relate to this life, and the &s;pirit of truth which guides into all truth, leavens the mind with a pious concern, that <HI>what&s;oever we do in word or deed, may be done in his name,</HI> Col. iii. 17.</P>
<P>Hence &s;uch buildings, furniture, food, and raiment, as be&s;t an&s;wer our nece&s;&s;ities, and are the lea&s;t likely to feed that &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit which is our enemy, are the mo&s;t ac|ceptable to us.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate the mind is tender, and in|wardly watchful, that the love of gain draw us not into any bu&s;ine&s;s, which may weaken our love to our heavenly father, or bring unnece&s;&s;ary trouble to any of his creatures.</P>
<P>Thus the way gradually opens to cea&s;e from that &s;pirit which craves riches and
<PB N="23" REF="011124_0021_0F853678CB0077A0">things fetched far, which &s;o mixeth with the cu&s;toms of this world, and &s;o intrudes upon the true harmony of life, that the right me|dium of labour is very much departed from. And as the minds of people are &s;ettled in a &s;teady concern, not to hold nor po&s;&s;e&s;s any thing but what may be held con&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom from above, they con&s;ider what they po&s;&s;e&s;s as the gift of God, and are in|wardly exerci&s;ed, that in all parts of their conduct they may act agreeable to the nature of the peaceable government of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>A little &s;upports &s;uch a life; and in a &s;tate truly re&s;igned to the Lord, the eye is &s;ingle, to &s;ee what outward employ he leads into, as a means of our &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and a lively care is maintained to hold to that without launching further.</P>
<P>There is a harmony in the &s;everal parts of this divine work in the hearts of people; he who leads them to cea&s;e from tho&s;e gainful employments, carried on in that wi&s;dom which is from beneath, delivers al&s;o from the de&s;ire after worldly greatne&s;s, and reconciles the mind to a life &s;o plain, that a little doth &s;uffice.</P>
<P>Here the real comforts of life are not le&s;|&s;ened. Moderate exerci&s;e, in the way of
<PB N="24" REF="011124_0022_0F8536798B47F468">true wi&s;dom, is plea&s;ant both to mind and body.</P>
<P>Food and raiment &s;ufficient, though in the greate&s;t &s;implicity, is accepted with con|tent and gratitude.</P>
<P>The mutual love, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the faithful followers of Chri&s;t, is more pure than that friend&s;hip which is not &s;ea&s;oned with humility, how &s;pecious &s;oever the ap|pearance.</P>
<P>Where people depart from pure wi&s;dom in one ca&s;e, it is often an introduction to de|part from it in many more; and thus a &s;pirit which &s;eeks for outward greatne&s;s, and leads into worldly wi&s;dom to attain it, and &s;upport it, gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind.</P>
<P>In beholding the cu&s;tomary departure from the true medium of labour, and that unnece&s;&s;ary toil which many go through, in &s;upporting outward greatne&s;s, and procuring delicacies:</P>
<P>In beholding how the true calmne&s;s of life is changed into hurry, and that many, by eagerly pur&s;uing outward trea&s;ure, are in great danger of withering as to the inward &s;tate of the mind:</P>
<P>In meditating on the works of this &s;pirit, and on the de&s;olations it makes among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, I may thankfully
<PB N="25" REF="011124_0023_0F85367A480C7878">acknowledge, that I often feel pure love be|get longings in my heart, for the exaltation of the peaceable kingdom of Chri&s;t, and an engagement to labour according to the gift be&s;towed on me, for the promoting an hum|ble, plain, temperate way of living. A life where no unnece&s;&s;ary cares, nor expences, may encumber our minds, nor le&s;&s;en our a|bility to do good; where no de&s;ires after riches, or greatne&s;s, may lead into hard deal|ing; where no connections with worldly minded men, may abate our love to God, nor weaken a true zeal for righteou&s;ne&s;s. A life, wherein we may diligently labour for re&s;ign|edne&s;s to do, and &s;uffer, whatever our hea|venly father may allot for us, in reconciling the world to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When the prophet I&s;aiah had uttered his vi&s;ion, and declared that a time was coming wherein <HI>&s;words &s;hould be beat into plow&s;hares, and &s;pears into pruning hooks, and that nation &s;hould not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, nor learn war any more;</HI> he immediately direct the minds of people to the divine teacher, in this remarkable language, <HI>O hou&s;e Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light the Lord,</HI> I&s;aiah ii. 5.</P>
<P>To wait for the direction of this light, in all temporal as well as &s;piritual concerns, ap|pears <PB N="26" REF="011124_0024_0F85367B05F4E700">nece&s;&s;ary; for if in any ca&s;e we enter lightly into temporal affairs, without feeling this &s;pirit of truth to open our way therein, and through the love of this world proceed on, and &s;eek for gain by that bu&s;ine&s;s or traffic, which <HI>is not of the father, but of the world,</HI> 1 John ii. 16, we fail in our te&s;timony to the purity and peace of his go|vernment; and get into that which is for cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>This matter hath lain heavy on my mind, it being evident, that a life le&s;s humble, le&s;s &s;imple and plain, than that which Chri&s;t leads his &s;heep into, does nece&s;&s;arily require a &s;upport, which pure wi&s;dom does not pro|vide for; hence there is no probability of our being <HI>a peculiar people, &s;o zealous of good works, as to have no fellow&s;hip with works of darkne&s;s,</HI> Titus ii. 14. Ephe&s;. v. 11, while we have wants to &s;upply which have their foundation in cu&s;tom, and do not come with|in the meaning of tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ll the&s;e things,</HI> Matt. vi. 32.</P>
<P>The&s;e things which he beholds nece&s;&s;ary <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his people, he fails not to give them in his own way, and time; but as his ways are above our ways, and his thoughts above our
<PB N="27" REF="011124_0025_0F85367BDD9188C8">thoughts, &s;o imaginary wants are different <HI>from the&s;e things which be knoweth that we have need of.</HI></P>
<P>As my meditations have been on the&s;e things, compa&s;&s;ion hath filled my heart to|ward my fellow creatures, involved in cu|&s;toms grown up in <HI>the wi&s;dom of this world, which is fooli&s;hne&s;s with God,</HI> 1 Cor. iii. 19; and O that the youth may be &s;o thoroughly experienced in an humble walking before the Lord, that they may be his children, and know him to be their refuge, their &s;afe un|failing refuge! through the various dangers attending this uncertain &s;tate of being.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e who&s;e minds are redeemed from the love of wealth, and who are content with a plain, &s;imple way of living, do yet find that to conduct the affairs of a family, without giv|ing countenance to unrighteous proceedings, or having fellow&s;hip with works of darkne&s;s, the mo&s;t diligent care is nece&s;&s;ary:</P>
<P>If cu&s;toms, di&s;tingui&s;hable from univer&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> righteou&s;ne&s;s, and oppo&s;ite to the true &s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> denying life, are now prevalent, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mixed with trade, and with almo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> employ, that it is only through hu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> waiting on the inward guidance of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that we may rea&s;onably hope to walk <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="28" REF="011124_0026_0F85367DAE265C90">and &s;upport an uniform te&s;timony to the peaceable government of Chri&s;t:</P>
<P>If this be the ca&s;e, how lamentably do they expo&s;e them&s;elves to temptations, who give way to the love of riches, conform to expen&s;ive living, and reach forth for gain, to &s;upport cu&s;toms, which our holy &s;hep|herd leads not into.</P>
