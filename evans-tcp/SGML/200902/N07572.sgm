<HEAD>A LETTER TO A FRIEND in the COUNTRY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Philadelphia,</HI>
<DATE><HI>April</HI> 12, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Apology was unnece&s;&s;ary. It will be no <HI>Trouble,</HI> but a <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> if I can give you the Satisfaction you de&s;ire. I &s;hall therefore immediately communicate to you my Motives for approving the Propo&s;al of endeavouring to obtain a <HI>Royal Government,</HI> in Exchange for this of the Proprietaries; with &s;uch An&s;wers to the Objections you mention, as, in my Opinion, fully obviate them.</P>
<P>I do not purpo&s;e entering into the Merits of the Di&s;putes between the Proprietaries and the People: I only ob&s;erve it as a Fact known to us all, that &s;uch Di&s;putes there are, and that they
<PB N="3" REF="009664_0003_0F77882EDEA7F620">
have long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, greatly to the Prejudice of the Province, clogging and embarra&s;&s;ing all the Wheels of Government, and exceedingly ob|&s;tructing the publick Defence, and the Mea&s;ures wi&s;ely concerted by our Gracious Sovereign, for the common Security of the Colonies. I may add it as another Fact, that <HI>we are all heartily tired of the&s;e Di&s;putes.</HI></P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that Di&s;putes of the &s;ame Kind have ari&s;en in ALL Proprietary Go|vernments, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted till their Di&s;&s;olution; All were made unhappy by them, and found no Relief but in recurring finally to the immediate Government of the Crown. <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and <HI>Ma|ryland,</HI> are the only Two of the Kind remaining, and both at this In&s;tant agitated by the &s;ame Con|tentions between Proprietary Intere&s;t and Power, and Popular Liberty. Thro' the&s;e Contentions the good People of that Province are rendered equally unhappy with our &s;elves, and their Pro|prietary, perhaps, more &s;o than our's; for he has no <HI>Quakers</HI> in his A&s;&s;embly to &s;addle with the Blame of tho&s;e Contentions, nor can he ju&s;tify him&s;elf with the Pretence, that turning to the Church has made his People his Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> had &s;carce been &s;ettled Twenty Years, when the&s;e Di&s;putes began between the fir&s;t Proprietor and the original Settlers; they continued, with &s;ome Intermi&s;&s;ions, during his whole Life;&mdash; his Widow took them up, and continued them after his Death. Her Sons re|&s;um'd

them very early, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See their Me&s;&s;age to the A&s;&s;embly, in which the Right of &s;itting on their own Adjournments is denied.</NOTE> and they &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t. &mdash;Mi&s;chievous and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing as they have been found to both Proprietors and People, it does not appear that there is any Pro&s;pect of their being extingui&s;h'd, till either the Proprietary Pur&s;e is unable to &s;upport them, or the Spirit of the Peo|ple &s;o broken, that they &s;hall be willing to &s;ub|mit to any Thing, rather than continue them. The fir&s;t is not very likely to happen, as that immen&s;e E&s;tate goes on increa&s;ing.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering all Circum&s;tances, I am at length inclin'd to think, that the Cau&s;e of the&s;e mi&s;e|rable Contentions is not to be &s;ought for merely in the Depravity and Selfi&s;hne&s;s of human Minds. For tho' it is not unlikely that in the&s;e, as well as in other Di&s;putes, there are <HI>Faults on both Sides,</HI> every glowing Coal being apt to inflame its Op|po&s;ite; yet I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that all Pro|prietary Rulers are wor&s;e Men than other Rulers, nor that all People in Proprietary Governments are wor&s;e People than tho&s;e in other Govern|ments. I &s;u&s;pect therefore, that the Cau&s;e is radi|cal, interwoven in the Con&s;titution, and &s;o be|come of the very Nature, of Proprietary Govern|ments; and will therefore produce its Effects, as long as &s;uch Governments continue.&mdash;And, as &s;ome Phy&s;icians &s;ay, every Animal Body brings into the World among its original Stamina, the
<PB N="5" REF="009664_0005_0F7788305EC51B10">
Seeds of that Di&s;ea&s;e that &s;hall finally produce its Di&s;&s;olution; &s;o the Political Body of a Proprie|tary Government, contains tho&s;e convul&s;ive Prin|ciples that will at length de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>I may not be Philo&s;opher enough to develop tho&s;e Principles, nor would this Letter afford me Room, if I had Abilities, for &s;uch a Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The <HI>Fact</HI> &s;eems &s;ufficient for our Purpo&s;e, and the <HI>Fact</HI> is notorious, that &s;uch Contentions have been in all Proprietary Governments, and have brought, or are now bringing, them all to a Conclu&s;ion.&mdash; I will only mention one Parti|cular common to them all. Proprietaries mu&s;t have a Multitude of private Accounts and Deal|ings with almo&s;t all the People of their Provinces, either for Purcha&s;e-money or Quit-rents. Deal|ings often occa&s;ion Differences, and Differences produce mutual Opinions of Inju&s;tice. If Pro|prietaries do not in&s;i&s;t on &s;mall Rights, they mu&s;t on the Whole lo&s;e large Sums; and if they do in&s;i&s;t on &s;mall Rights, they &s;eem to de&s;cend, their Dignity &s;uffers in the Opinion of the Peo|ple, and with it the Re&s;pect nece&s;&s;ary to keep up the Authority of Government.&mdash;The People, who think them&s;elves injured in Point of Property, are di&s;contented with the Government, and grow tur|bulent; and the Proprietaries u&s;ing their Powers of Government to procure for them&s;elves what they think Ju&s;tice in their Points of Property, ren|ders tho&s;e Powers odious.&mdash; I &s;u&s;pect this has had no &s;mall Share in producing the Confu&s;ions inci|dent
<PB N="6" REF="009664_0006_0F7788310EB31B78">
to tho&s;e Governments.&mdash;They appear, how|ever, to be, <HI>of all others,</HI> the mo&s;t unhappy.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent we are in a wretched Situation. The Government that ought to keep all in Order is it&s;elf weak, and has &s;carce Authority enough to keep the common Peace. Mobs a&s;&s;emble and kill (we &s;carce dare &s;ay <HI>murder</HI>) Numbers of in|nocent People in cold Blood, who were under the Protection of the Government. Proclamations are i&s;&s;ued to bring the Rioters to Ju&s;tice. Tho&s;e Proclamations are treated with the utmo&s;t In|dignity and Contempt. Not a Magi&s;trate dares wag a Finger towards di&s;covering or apprehend|ing, the <HI>Delinquents,</HI> (we mu&s;t not call them <HI>Murderers</HI>). They a&s;&s;emble again, and with Arms in their Hands, approach the Capital.&mdash; The Government truckles, conde&s;cends to cajole them, and drops all Pro&s;ecution of their Crimes; whil&s;t hone&s;t Citizens, threatened in their Lives and Fortunes, flie the Province, as having no Confidence in the Publick Protection. We are daily threatened with more of the&s;e Tumults; and the Government, which in its Di&s;tre&s;s call'd aloud on the &s;ober Inhabitants to come with Arms to its A&s;&s;i&s;tance, now &s;ees tho&s;e who afford|ed that A&s;&s;i&s;tance daily libell'd, abus'd, and me|nac'd by its Partizans for &s;o doing; whence it has little Rea&s;on to expect &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance on another Occa&s;ion:&mdash;In this Situation, what is to be done? By what Means is that Harmony between the two Branches of Government to be obtain'd, without which the internal Peace of the Province can not
<PB N="7" REF="009664_0007_0F778831DA2924C0">
be well &s;ecured? One Project is, to turn all <HI>Qua|kers</HI> out of the A&s;&s;embly; or, by obtaining more Members for the Back Counties, to get a Majority in, who are not <HI>Quakers.</HI>&mdash;This, perhaps, is not very difficult to do; and more Members for tho&s;e Counties may, on other Accounts, be proper; but I much que&s;tion if it would an&s;wer this End, as I &s;ee among the Members, that tho&s;e who are not <HI>Quakers,</HI> and even tho&s;e from the Back Counties, are as hearty and unanimous in oppo&s;ing what they think Proprietary Inju&s;tice, as the <HI>Quakers</HI> them&s;elves, if not more &s;o.&mdash;Religion has hap|pily nothing to do with our pre&s;ent Differences, tho' great Pains is taken to lug it into the Squab|ble.&mdash;And even were the <HI>Quakers</HI> extirpated, I doubt whether the Proprietaries, while they pur|&s;ue the &s;ame Mea&s;ures, would be a Whit more at their Ea&s;e.&mdash;Another Project is, to chu&s;e none for A&s;&s;embly-men but &s;uch as are Friends to the Proprietaries.&mdash;The Number of Members is not &s;o great, but that I believe this Scheme may be practicable, if you look for Repre&s;enta|tives among Proprietary Officers and Depend|ants. Undoubtedly it would produce great Harmony between Governor and A&s;&s;embly: But how would both of them agree with the Peo|ple? Their Principles and Conduct mu&s;t greatly change, if they would be elected a &s;econd Year. But that might be needle&s;s. Six Parts in Seven agreeing with the Governor, could make the Hou&s;e perpetual. This, however, would not
<PB N="8" REF="009664_0008_0F7788329427B6B8">
probably e&s;tabli&s;h Peace in the Province. The Quarrel the People now have with the Proprie|taries, would then be with both the Proprietaries and A&s;&s;embly. &mdash; There &s;eems to remain then but one Remedy for our Evils, a Remedy approved by Experience, and which has been tried with Succe&s;s by other Provinces; I mean that of an immediate ROYAL GOVERNMENT, without the Intervention of Proprietary Powers, which, like unnece&s;&s;ary Springs and Movements in a Machine, are &s;o apt to produce Di&s;order.</P>
<P>It is not to be expected that the Propo&s;al of a Change like this, &s;hould meet with no Objections. &mdash;Tho&s;e you have mention'd to me concerning Liberty of Con&s;cience and the Privileges of Di&s;|&s;enters, are, however, not difficult to an&s;wer; as they &s;eem to ari&s;e merely from want of Infor|mation, or Acquaintance with the State of other Colonies, before and after &s;uch Changes had been made in their Government. <HI>Carolina</HI> and the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> were formerly Proprietary Govern|ments, but now immediately under the Crown; and their Ca&s;es had many Circum&s;tances &s;imilar to ours.&mdash;Of the Fir&s;t we are told,</P>
<P><Q>There was a natural Infirmity in the Policy of their Charter, which was the Source of many of the Misfortunes of the Colony, with|out any Imputation on the noble Families con|cern'd. For the Grantees, [the Proprietors] being eight in Number, and not incorporated, and no Provi&s;ion being made to conclude the
<PB N="9" REF="009664_0009_0F7788335B64EC98">
whole Number by the Voices of the Majority, there could not be timely Mea&s;ures always agreed on, which were proper or nece&s;&s;ary for the good Government of the Plantation. In the mean Time the Inhabitants grew unruly and quarrelled about Religion and Politicks, and while there was a mere Anarchy among them, they were expos'd to the Attacks and In&s;ults of their <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Neighbours, whom they had imprudently provok'd and in|jur'd;&mdash; and as if they had con&s;pir'd again&s;t the Growth of the Colony, they repealed their Laws for Liberty of Con&s;cience, though the Majority of the People were Di&s;&s;enters, and had re&s;orted thither under the publick Faith for a compleat Indulgence, which they con&s;i|dered as Part of their <HI>Magna Charta.</HI>&mdash; With|in the&s;e four Years an End was put to their Sorrows; for about that Time, the Lords Proprietors and the Planters, (who had long been heartily tir'd of each other) were, by the Interpo&s;ition of the Legi&s;lature, fairly divorc|ed for ever, and the Property of the Whole ve&s;ted in the Crown <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New and accurate Account of <HI>Carolina,</HI> p. <HI>14.</HI> Printed at <HI>London, 1733.</HI></NOTE></Q> And the above-men|tion'd injudicious and unju&s;t Act, again&s;t the Privileges of Di&s;&s;enters, was repeal'd by the King in Council.</P>

the Colony &s;o low, that an Act of Parliament, if po&s;&s;ible to prevent the la&s;t ruinous Con&s;e|quences of the&s;e Divi&s;ions, put the Province under the immediate Care and In&s;pection of the Crown. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Account of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Settlements in <HI>America.</HI> Page <HI>23</HI> concerning <HI>Carolina.</HI></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>And Governor JOHNSON, at his fir&s;t meeting the A&s;&s;embly there, after the Change, tells them,</P>
<P><Q>His Maje&s;ty, out of his great Goodne&s;s and Fatherly Care of you, and at the earne&s;t Re|que&s;t and Solicitation of your &s;elves, has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, at a great Expence, to purcha&s;e &s;even Eighths of the late Lords Pro|prietaries Charter, whereby you are become under his immediate Government; a BLESS|ING and SECURITY we have been <HI>long praying for,</HI> and &s;olicitous of; the <HI>good Effects</HI> of which we <HI>daily experience</HI> by the <HI>Safety</HI> we en|joy, as well in our Trade, by the Protection of his Ships of War, as by Land, by an Indepen|dant Company maintain'd purely for our Safe|ty and Encouragement.

<P>By the&s;e Accounts we learn, that the People of that Province, far from lo&s;ing by the Change, obtain'd internal Security and external Protec|tion, both by Sea and Land; the Di&s;&s;enters a Re&s;toration and E&s;tabli&s;hment of their Privi|leges,

which the Proprietary Government at|tempted to deprive them of; and the whole Province, Favours in point of Trade with re|&s;pect to their grand Staple Commodity, which from that Time they were allowed to carry di|rectly to foreign Ports, without being oblig'd, as before, to enter in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to the neighbouring Province of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> we find, in a Repre&s;entation from the Board of Trade to the Crown, dated <HI>White|hall, Oct.</HI> 2&punc; 1701. the following Account of it, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That the Inhabitants in a Petition to his Maje&s;ty the la&s;t Year, complained of &s;everal Grievances they lay under by the Neglect or Mi&s;management of the Proprietors of that Province, or their Agents;&mdash; unto which they al&s;o added, that during the whole Time the &s;aid Proprietors have govern'd, or pre|tended to govern, that Province, they have never taken care to pre&s;erve or defend the &s;ame from the <HI>Indians,</HI> or other Enemies, by <HI>&s;ending</HI> or <HI>providing</HI> any Arms, Ammunition or Stores, <HI>as they ought to have done;</HI> and the &s;aid Inhabitants thereupon humbly prayed, his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to commi&s;&s;ionate &s;ome fit Per&s;on, to be Governor over them. &mdash;That it has been repre&s;ented to us by &s;e|veral Letters, Memorials, and other Papers, as well from the Inhabitants as Proprietors, that they are at pre&s;ent in <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Anar|chy,</HI> and that it is much to be apprehended, le&s;t by the Heats of the Parties that are among&s;t

<P>It is farther objected, you tell me, that <HI>if we have a Royal Government, we mu&s;t have with it a Bi&s;hop, and a Spiritual Court, and mu&s;t pay Tythes to &s;upport an Epi&s;copal Clergy.</HI> A Bi&s;hop for <HI>America</HI> has been long talk'd of in <HI>England,</HI> and probably from the apparent Nece&s;&s;ity of the Thing, will &s;ooner or later be appointed; becau&s;e a Voyage to <HI>England</HI> for Ordination is extream|ly inconvenient and expen&s;ive to the young Clergy educated in <HI>America;</HI> and the Epi&s;copal Churches and Clergy in the&s;e Colonies cannot &s;o conveniently be governed and regulated by a Bi&s;hop re&s;iding in <HI>England,</HI> as by one re&s;iding among the&s;e committed to his Care. But this Event will happen neither &s;ooner nor later for our being, or not being, under a Royal Govern|ment. And the Spiritual Court, if the Bi&s;hop &s;hould hold one, can have Authority only with his own People, if with them, &s;ince it is not likely that any Law of this Province will ever be made to &s;ubmit the Inhabitants to it, or oblige them to pay Tithes; and without &s;uch
<PB N="16" REF="009664_0016_0F7788389206AF60">
Law, Tithes can no more be demanded here than they are in any other Colony; and there is not a &s;ingle In&s;tance of <HI>Tithes</HI> demanded or paid in any Part of <HI>America.</HI> A Maintenance has, indeed, been e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;ome Colonies, for the Epi&s;copal Clergy; as in <HI>Virginia,</HI> a Royal Government; and in <HI>Maryland,</HI> a Proprietary Government: But this was done by Acts of their own, which they were not oblig'd to make if they did not chu&s;e it.</P>
<P>That <HI>we &s;hall have a &s;tanding Army to main|tain,</HI> is another Bugbear rais'd to terrify us from endeavouring to obtain a King's Government. It is very po&s;&s;ible that the Crown may think it nece&s;&s;ary to keep Troops in <HI>America</HI> hencefor|ward, to maintain its Conque&s;ts, and defend the Colonies; and that the Parliament may e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome Revenue ari&s;ing out of the American Trade to be apply'd towards &s;upporting tho&s;e Troops. It is po&s;&s;ible too, that we may, after a few Years Experience, be generally very well &s;atisfy'd with that Mea&s;ure, from the &s;teady Pro|tection it will afford us again&s;t Foreign Ene|mies, and the Security of internal Peace among our&s;elves without the Expence or Trouble of a Militia. But a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, my Friend, that whether we like it or not, our continuing under a Proprietary Government will not prevent it, nor our coming under a Royal Government promote and forward it, any more than they would prevent or procure Rain or Sun&s;hine.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="009664_0017_0F77883956D1C818">The other Objections you have communicated to me, are, that <HI>in ca&s;e of a Change of Proprietary for Royal Government, our Judges and other Officers will be appointed and &s;ent us from</HI> England; <HI>we mu&s;t have a Legi&s;lative Council; our A&s;&s;embly will lo&s;e the Right of Sitting on their own Adjournments, we &s;hall lo&s;e the Right of chu&s;ing Sheriffs, and annual A&s;&s;emblies, and of voting by Ballot.</HI> I &s;hall not en|ter into the Que&s;tion, whether Judges from <HI>England</HI> would probably be of Advantage or Di&s;advantage to our Law Proceedings. It is needle&s;s, as the Power of appointing them is given to the Governor here, by a Law that has receiv'd the Royal A&s;&s;ent, the <HI>Act for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing Courts.</HI> The King's Governor only comes in Place of a Proprietary Governor; he mu&s;t (if the Change is made) take the Govern|ment as he finds it. He can alter nothing. The &s;ame An&s;wer &s;erves for all the &s;ub&s;equent Objections. A Legi&s;lative Council under pro|per Regulations might perhaps be an Amend|ment of our Con&s;titution, but it cannot take Place without our Con&s;ent, as our Con&s;titution is otherwi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h'd; nor can our A&s;&s;embly lo&s;e the <HI>Right of Sitting on their own Adjournments;</HI> nor the People that of <HI>chu&s;ing Sheriffs, and annu|al A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> or of <HI>Voting by Ballot.</HI> The&s;e Rights being all confirm'd by Acts of A&s;&s;embly a&s;&s;ented to by the Crown.

both pa&s;t in the 4th of Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> I know it has been a&s;&s;erted, to intimidate us, that tho&s;e Acts, &s;o far from being approved by the Crown, were never pre&s;ented. But I can a&s;&s;ure you, from good Authority, that they, with forty-eight others. (all pa&s;s'd at the &s;ame Time by Governor <HI>Evans,</HI>) were duly laid before the Queen in Council; who on the 28th of <HI>April</HI> 1709 referred the &s;ame to the Board of Trade. The Board on the 8th of <HI>September</HI> 1709, re|ported upon the &s;aid Fifty Acts, that they had con&s;idered the &s;ame, and had taken the Opinion of the Attorney General upon &s;everal of them in point of Law; and they repre&s;ented again&s;t Six of them, as unfit to be continued in force; but as to the other forty-four, the Titles of which are given at large, and among them the two <HI>material Acts</HI> above mentioned, they had <HI>no Objection</HI> to the &s;ame. Whereupon there i&s;&s;ued two Orders of the Queen in Council both dated at the Court at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> the 24th of <HI>October</HI> 1709, one repealing the Six Laws objected to; and the other, ap|proving the remaining Forty-four. This is a Fact that you may depend upon. There is therefore nothing now that can deprive us of tho&s;e Privileges but an Act of Parliament; and we may rely on the united Ju&s;tice of King, Lords, and Commons, that no &s;uch Act will ever pa&s;s, while we continue loyal and dutiful Subjects. An Act of A&s;&s;embly, indeed may give them up; but I tru&s;t, urgent as they are

for Admi&s;&s;ion, we &s;hall never &s;ee Proprietary Friends enow in the Hou&s;e, to make that dete&s;|table Sacrifice.</P>
<P>In fine, it does not appear to me, that this <HI>Change of Government</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly hurt us; and I &s;ee many Advantages that may flow from it. The Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Change of Government,</HI> &s;eems, in|deed, to be too exten&s;ive; and is apt to give the Idea of a general and total Change of our Laws and Con&s;titution. It is rather and only a <HI>Change of Governor,</HI> that is, in&s;tead of &s;elf-intere&s;ted Proprietaries, a gracious King! His Maje&s;ty who has no Views but for the Good of the People will thenceforth appoint the Governor, who, un|&s;hackled by Proprietary In&s;tructions, will be at Liberty to join with the A&s;&s;embly in enacting whole&s;ome Laws. At pre&s;ent, when the King requires Supplies of his faithful Subjects, and they are willing and de&s;irous to grant them, the Proprietaries intervene and &s;ay, <HI>unle&s;s our private Intere&s;ts in certain Particulars are &s;erved,</HI> NO|THING SHALL BE DONE. This in&s;olent Tribuni|tial VETO, has long encumbered all our Pu|blick Affairs, and been productive of many Mi&s;|chiefs. By the Mea&s;ure propo&s;ed, not even the Proprietaries can ju&s;tly complain of any Injury. The being oblig'd to fulfill a fair Contract is no Injury. The Crown will be under no Difficulty in compleating the old Contract made with their Father, as there needs no Application to Parlia|ment for the nece&s;&s;ary Sum, &s;ince half the Quit-Rents

<P>On the whole, I cannot but think, the more the Propo&s;al is con&s;idered, of <HI>an humble Petition to the</HI> KING, <HI>to take this Province under his Ma|je&s;ty's immediate Protection and Government,</HI> the more unanimou&s;ly we &s;hall go into it. We are chiefly People of <HI>three Countries: Briti&s;h</HI> Spirits can no longer bear the Treatment they have recei|ved, nor will they put on the Chains prepared for them by a Fellow Subject. And the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> have felt too &s;everely the Oppre&s;|&s;ions of <HI>hard-hearted Landlords</HI> and <HI>arbitrary Princes,</HI> to wi&s;h to &s;ee, in the Proprietaries of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> both the one and the other united.</P>
