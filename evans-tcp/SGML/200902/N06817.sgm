<HEAD>RULES of <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> in TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>MY latter years have been &s;pent mo&s;tly a|mong the trading part of mankind; and I have received many obligations from them: and I think my&s;elf bound to do them this right, to let the world know, that I have found more honour and gratitude, more clearne&s;s and integrity among&s;t this &s;ort of men, than I ever could among&s;t others, who&s;e quality and education rai&s;ed my expectations higher: it will be therefore no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to me, if any endeavours of mine can render them any con&s;iderable &s;ervice.</P>
<P>There is no condition of life free from tempta|tions and difficulties, apt to embroil our happine&s;s, and infect our innocence, and therefore neither this of traders; the evils they are &s;ubject to, may be reduced to two heads; their mi&s;carrying in trade, or in religion. I will therefore begin with &s;uch rules as may &s;erve to prevent the former, and then proceed to &s;uch as concern the latter.</P>
<P>If we trace the ruin of &s;uch as fail or break, back to its original, we &s;hall find it generally to be either idlene&s;s or pride. Idlene&s;s, the parent of all &s;ot|ti&s;h vices; pride, the parent of expen&s;ive follies and ruinous projects. I will therefore lay down the&s;e two rules as the foundations of the trader's &s;e|cular pro&s;perity. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That he mu&s;t be diligent and indu&s;trious. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That he mu&s;t not be above his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="008643_0003_102FA57D25D15DB0">1. He mu&s;t be diligent and indu&s;trious. You &s;eem born for indu&s;try; and though &s;ome pretend to be &s;ent into the world only to enjoy a fortune, it is plain you are fir&s;t to rai&s;e one&punc; and tho' there may be &s;ome fortunate men in the world, that &s;eem to thrive rather by chance than virtue, and owe more to the care of others than their own; yet, I am &s;ure, in the ordinary methods of providence, diligence and indu&s;try are the high-way to wealth and plenty; virtue and &s;obriety to wi&s;e and &s;ecure enjoyments. And I know not with what con|fidence men can promi&s;e them&s;elves the ble&s;&s;ing and favour of God on any other terms. He has made nothing on purpo&s;e to be idle and u&s;ele&s;s: the heavenly bodies never cea&s;e to yield their light and influence, nor the terre&s;trial ones their fruit. We our&s;elves do &s;ub&s;i&s;t by a continual motion; and &s;hould our blood and &s;pirits grow dull and &s;luggi&s;h, our life mu&s;t needs expire with their activity. <HI>Man is born to labour as the &s;parks fly upward;</HI> our ca|pacities and endowments de&s;tine and urge us to it, the nece&s;&s;ities and wants of this needy beggarly &s;tate (in which nature, how kind &s;oever it was to the golden age, does not furni&s;h us with any thing, without art and indu&s;try) exact and demand it, and the laws of human &s;ociety oblige us to it: for it is but fit that every one &s;hould contribute his &s;hot for the entertainment of the publick; and that he &s;hould not, like a drone, be fea&s;ted and maintained by the labour and travail of others. And &s;o far, la&s;tly, is Chri&s;tianity from abrogating this law of nature, that it earne&s;tly enforces it. <HI>Let ours learn to maintain good works for nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es, that they be not unfruitful;</HI> that is, that they be not a &s;hame
<PB N="5" REF="008643_0004_102FA57F1E68D210">
and burden to them&s;elves and families, to the com|monwealth, or Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. Propo&s;e not then (I addre&s;s my&s;elf here to apprentices and beginners) propo&s;e not to exempt your&s;elves from that uni|ver&s;al law of labour and travail to which the whole creation is &s;ubject; you e&s;pecially who lie under more immediate and particular obligations to it. It is an unaccountable folly for one, who is to make his fortune in the world, to apply him&s;elf to trade, rather as a diver&s;ion than a bu&s;ine&s;s, and to de&s;ign it only as a &s;upport and fund for &s;loth and luxury. It is madne&s;s and phren&s;ie in any one to propo&s;e to be Ma&s;ter of his time before he is Ma&s;ter of his trade; and to indulge his plea&s;ures, before he has made provi&s;ion to defray the expence of them; and yet this, I doubt, is too, too general a practice. Whereas, would young men con&s;ider the matter a|right, they would find that they do but prevent their plea&s;ures, by gathering them before they are ripe; and do but make their troubles and vexations end|le&s;s, by indulging their ea&s;e and lazine&s;s too &s;oon. Contradictious projects! to propo&s;e at once to live idly, and yet to thrive! to live plea&s;urably, and grow rich! it is true, there are many traders, who live in much ea&s;e and plenty, and make a very hand|&s;ome figure in the world, and it is but fit there &s;hould be &s;uch. Trade is the &s;upport and ornament of kingdoms; and no man of &s;en&s;e will any more envy the man of trade his wealth, than the man of the &s;word his honour, or the man of letters and abilities his places and preferments. But, if I could, I would have men grow up to all the&s;e by labour and indu&s;try, by an apprentice&s;hip of &s;obriety and virtue. I would have enjoyment be the reward of
<PB N="6" REF="008643_0005_102FA580E0C9FF48">
merit. I would not have ea&s;e and plea&s;ure be ra|vi&s;hed by the loo&s;e and unworthy; but regularly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;uch as have taken pains to purcha&s;e both, and have &s;en&s;e, experience, and virtue e|nough to enjoy them.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The trader mu&s;t not be above his call|ing. Pride and vanity are generally &s;worn ene|mies, both to the content and pro&s;perity of traders; but then it mu&s;t be remembred, &s;ome are but lightly tinged, others more thoroughly and deeply dyed with the&s;e vices. In &s;ome they produce only little comical affectations and almo&s;t innocent excur&s;ions; but in others, very fatal di&s;orders and irregularities. There is no gracefulne&s;s in any motion that is not natural. A man of low &s;tature may add &s;omething to his height, but nothing to his comeline&s;s, by &s;trutting upon &s;tilts. Nor is there only an ungrace|fulne&s;s, but an unea&s;ine&s;s in all affected motions. We are all a little purblind and dim-&s;ighted in this world; and therefore walk more &s;ecurely in the ways we are acquainted with. But, for my part, when an error is only comical, and expo&s;es men no further than to a little raillery and cen&s;ure, it is &s;carce worth my while to pre&s;cribe to it; and I cannot tell whether it be worth every man's while to be at the charge of correcting a humour, which if it do a little expo&s;e him, does yet plea&s;e him too. The pride and ambition which I would extirpate, is &s;uch a one as I have ob&s;erved fatal to the trade&s;man's fortune and repo&s;e; &s;uch as tempts him to de&s;pi&s;e and neglect his trade, or puts him upon expences which it cannot maintain, or engages him in bold or hazardous projects. This is an error which I
<PB N="7" REF="008643_0006_102FA58268C4FB30">
would fain reform; and methinks a few &s;ober re|flections &s;hould here prevail. What, can it be &s;en&s;e to make a &s;hew abroad, at the expence of your con|tent and peace at home? what, is it not much bet|ter to be mode&s;t and &s;afe, to be humble and at ea&s;e, than to &s;uffer daily anxieties and perplexities, and to have your mind always upon the rack, how to an&s;wer and &s;atisfy the importunities of pride and vanity? It is wor&s;e yet when a &s;hort piece of pa|geantry ends in perpetual infamy; when this impor|tunant humour is nouri&s;hed by robbery and inju&s;|tice, by fraud and cheat, committed upon widows and orphans, acquaintance and friends, and the neare&s;t relations. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am amazed to think, that any one's pride &s;hould be tickled by a fal&s;e and fatal grandeur, upheld only by wrong and inju&s;tice, and re&s;olving in a moment into indelible &s;hame and unretrievable ruin. For my part, I &s;hould in this ca&s;e look upon bravery, not as the marks of greatne&s;s, but ornaments of a &s;acrifice; not as the pomp of a triumph, but a funeral; and my lu&s;cious mor&s;els, how plea&s;ing &s;oever to my palate, would be ready to ri&s;e and recoil in my &s;tomach. As to tho&s;e who &s;eem to &s;corn their pro|fe&s;&s;ion, I have but this to &s;ay. Let them find out a more thriving one before they leave the old one, before they de&s;ert the profe&s;&s;ion they were bred to, for its meanne&s;s. Let them make &s;ure of a more honourable employment; or el&s;e the &s;corn they load their trade with, will be want of &s;en&s;e, not greatne&s;s of &s;pirit; a lazy pride, not a generous ambition. And, if &s;o, I am &s;ure there is no pro|fe&s;&s;ion &s;o mean as that of &s;loth and loo&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="008643_0007_102FA583F0DC2208"><HI>Sect.</HI> 2. The &s;econd &s;ort of rules are &s;uch as concern the religion of the trader or arti&s;an: for it is to little purpo&s;e that he thrive in his &s;ecular, if he run out in his Chri&s;tian calling; for this is to be fortunate, and yet mi&s;erable. Therefore,

<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He mu&s;t be &s;ure that his calling be lawful.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> That it be carried on with truth, ju&s;t|ice, and charity.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That his attendance on the bu&s;ine&s;s of this world, do not extingui&s;h his concern for a bet|ter; and his trade devour his religion, as <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s lean kine did the fat ones.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That he propo&s;e to him&s;elf proper and rational ends of trading.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He mu&s;t be &s;ure that his calling be lawful; that is, &s;uch as is neither forbidden by any law of God, or the magi&s;trate, nor does, in its own nature, mini&s;ter to vice. But that I may not per|plex mens minds with unnece&s;&s;ary &s;cruples, and tempt them to doubt of the lawfulne&s;s of all trades, that are any way made the in&s;truments of &s;in and folly&punc; you mu&s;t know, &s;ome things mini&s;ter to &s;in directly and nece&s;&s;arily; others only accidentally, and not by the immediate intention of the arti&s;t or trader, but the abu&s;e of others. The former &s;ort of trades are unlawful in them&s;elves, and no pre|tence can &s;anctify the u&s;e of them: he that directly and immediately mini&s;ters to a &s;in, communicates
<PB N="9" REF="008643_0008_102FA58713918580">
in the guilt of it; as he that purveys for the lu&s;t of others, partakes of the &s;in of the adulterer and forni|cator: but tho&s;e which mini&s;ter not purpo&s;ely and immediately, but accidentally, are yet in them|&s;elves lawful. Nor &s;hall the trader communicate in tho&s;e abu&s;es to which the lu&s;ts and vanities of others pro&s;titute them. Thus taverns are not un|lawful, becau&s;e abu&s;ed by intemperance; nor are all &s;hops of clothing to be &s;hut, becau&s;e thence peo|ple furni&s;h them&s;elves with &s;uch things as inflame their immode&s;ty and pride: the rea&s;on is plainly this, becau&s;e the &s;in may be &s;eparated from the trade; that wine, who&s;e full draughts are by &s;ome made u&s;e of to the defacing rea&s;on and enkindling lu&s;t, may as well refre&s;h the weary and delight the mode|rate; tho&s;e garments which adorn the proud and wanton, may be made u&s;e of to add a lu&s;tre to great|ne&s;s. The inconvenience would be in&s;ufferable, if every profe&s;&s;ion which did but indirectly and ca&s;ual|ly admini&s;ter to vice, were therefore &s;inful: the courts of ju&s;tice mu&s;t be laid a&s;ide, becau&s;e often|times the bar and bench have contributed to oppre&s;s, injure, and rob in form of law. The pulpit mu&s;t be forever &s;ilenced, becau&s;e men have &s;ometimes &s;own the &s;eeds of &s;edition and &s;lavery from hence. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">il the arts, either of war or peace, have &s;ome|times &s;erved the cruelty of the one, and luxury of the other, and by con&s;equence would be bani&s;hed out of all commonwealths. Yet here it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the more or le&s;s tendency any trade hath to the promoting vice, it is in the &s;ame proportion the more or le&s;s comfortable. And that it imports men, who love their peace and happine&s;s more than gain, not to debauch their callings them&s;elves, by pro&s;ti|tuting
<PB N="10" REF="008643_0009_102FA58CD96CF110">
them to extravagancies and exorbitances: and projecting profit from the intemperances and &s;ins, that is, the ruin of others: for it is not &s;ufficient to the peace and comfort of a good man's mind, that his calling be innocent, if his conduct of it be not &s;o too.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Trade ought to be managed with truth, ju&s;tice and charity: for without the&s;e it is only a more cleanly art of cheating or oppre&s;&s;ion; &s;ins, which I doubt, can receive but little excu&s;e or miti|gation from the cu&s;tom and practice of them: with|out the&s;e, trade cannot be regular and ea&s;y, nor gain comfortable and delightful; &s;ince no man can have any confidence in the protection of God, when the methods of his thriving are &s;uch as merit ven|geance, not a ble&s;&s;ing. Nor can I &s;ee any thing that can betray men into lying and knavery, but the want of true &s;en&s;e, as well as true faith; &s;ince tho' many by under ways have more &s;uddenly enriched them&s;elves; yet it is evident, that the wealth which is more regularly purcha&s;ed, is more plea&s;ant, du|rable, and la&s;ting; and that hone&s;t and equitable dealing is the &s;ure&s;t, if not the &s;peedie&s;t way to wealth. Nor are there, I believe, many in&s;tances of men, who, if they under&s;tood their bu&s;ine&s;s, have ever &s;uffered much by their uprightne&s;s and integrity in dealing; it being very hard to imagine, that a trader &s;hould be a lo&s;er by tho&s;e vir|tues which advance credit and reputation. But however this be, I am not now enquiring after wealth, but happine&s;s; to the obtainment of which I am very po&s;itive, that the ob&s;ervation of the&s;e mea|&s;ures is indi&s;pen&s;ible, &s;ince the contrary mu&s;t needs
<PB N="11" REF="008643_0010_102FA58FEEA96F40">
pervert the mind, &amp; intangle life: and as they extin|gui&s;h in the &s;oul all &s;parks of honour and greatne&s;s; &s;o mu&s;t they its courage and confidence, tranquil|lity and peace, which can re&s;ult from nothing, but the due moderation of our affections, and the con|&s;cience of our integrity.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The trader's attendance on his calling mu&s;t not di&s;charge him from his attendance on re|ligion. It is true, it is commonly &s;aid, and gene|rally admited that the duty of every one's &s;ecular calling is a part of religion; but this ought to be well under&s;tood, that &s;o neither a veneration for re|ligion breed a neglect of your callings, nor an over fond opinion of the merit of indu&s;try in your call|ing (as if all virtue were compri&s;ed in it) breed a contempt of religion: it is fit therefore to put you in mind, that arts and trades have not in them&s;elves any direct or immediate tendency, either to the im|provment of rea&s;on, or the production of virtue; they mini&s;ter to the nece&s;&s;ities of this world, not the glories of another; nor are they &s;o much the works of a rational and &s;piritual, as of a mortal and indi|gent being: from whence it follows, that tho' they are nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, yet can they de&s;erve to employ you no longer than either the public benefit or private convenience require it; and that you are then only wi&s;ely taken up about the&s;e, when neither your endowments nor fortunes capacitate you for a relief more immediately and di|rectly &s;erviceable to the purpo&s;es of rea&s;on and reva|lation: and finally, that the works of a &s;ecular pro|fe&s;&s;ion are only acceptable &s;acrifices to God, when con&s;ecrated by wi&s;e principles and virtues cleaving
<PB N="12" REF="008643_0011_102FA591757D7F28">
to and mingling with them. Do not therefore think, that a pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s can cancel your obligations to the duties of Chri&s;tianity. If a man could fan&s;ie, which I never can, bu&s;ine&s;s and reli|gion incompatible; it is evident which were to be preferred; &s;ince if God's will were &s;o, it is much better to be &s;tarved than to be damned. But with|out carrying the matter &s;o far, it is plain that virtue and religion, with a competency, render men abun|dantly more happy than wealth can do, if attended with the neglect or contempt of either: it is the riches of the mind make men great and happy; the igno|rant and irreligious can never be either. Let no man therefore think that he &s;uffers any damage, if he mu&s;t maintain his virtue and religion by the diminuti|on of his trade; tho' I cannot comprehend that there can be a nece&s;&s;ity of this: for I have never yet ob|&s;erved any man &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed and overcharged with bu&s;ine&s;s, as not to find time for plea&s;ure, when he has pretended he could find none for religion. In a word, the neglect of religion is capable of no excu&s;e; not only becau&s;e your future, but pre&s;ent happine&s;s, depends upon it. Mode&s;ty or moderation, to curb a vain and ambitious thir&s;t of wealth; faith or confi|dence in the providence of God, to re&s;train you from mean, ba&s;e and unlawful cour&s;es; &s;elf-re&s;ignation to prevent anxiety, and tho&s;e fears to which the uncer|tainties, changes and revolutions of times and trade make men &s;ubject, &s;eem to me as nece&s;&s;ary to the peace and happine&s;s of a trader, as a competent &s;tock, indu&s;try or &s;kill, can be to his worldly &s;ucce&s;s or pro&s;|perity: and tho' men who allow them&s;elves no time, either for attendance upon public religion, or pri|vate meditation, may talk finely of the&s;e virtues by
<PB N="13" REF="008643_0012_102FA59563844900">
way of notion and &s;peculation, it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them. <HI>How can he get wi&s;dom that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the good, that driveth oxen, and is occupied in their labours, and who&s;e talk is of bullocks?</HI> which the au|thor of <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus,</HI> by a parity of rea&s;on, extends further to all traders and arti&s;ans, who are in like manner wholly taken up in their art. I could there|fore wi&s;h that tho&s;e words of our Saviour, <HI>What &s;hall it profit a man, if he &s;hall gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul,</HI> were writ in capital letters in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous place of the counting hou&s;e, and the &s;hop, that you might ever and anon be put in mind, that there is one thing more nece&s;&s;ary, even than the diligent and pro&s;perous management of the trade, namely, religion. For to what pur|po&s;e is it, that your books are well kept, that there is order and regularity in the whole conduct of your trades, if at the &s;ame time your neglected hearts lie, like the field of the &s;luggard wa&s;te, and open, and over-grown with briers, and thorns, and weeds; or like the confu&s;ed &s;tock of a carele&s;s or un&s;kiful trader, which wa&s;tes and decays each day? to what purpo&s;e is it that you be punctual dealers towards men, if you be bankrupts towards God? to what purpo&s;e is it that you have credit and honour upon the <HI>Change,</HI> if you be poor and beggarly, &s;hameful and &s;neaking in your&s;elves within, having your &s;ouls de&s;titue of any true peace, wealth or courage; and &s;hift the accu&s;ations and importunities of con&s;cience, as much as a wretched debtor would a &s;evere and in|exorable creditor? ah! while you pur&s;ue the world, forget not that there is a heaven; and while you make provi&s;ion for time, make &s;ome too for eternity:
<PB N="14" REF="008643_0013_102F74BF5D983F88">
let your &s;tating your accounts with men&punc; put you in mind of clearing your accounts with God; and let the&s;e two things never be out of your thoughts; fir&s;t, that it is God who gives man power to get wealth; and next, that it is not a clear e&s;tate, but a clear &s;oul that makes man happy; I mean, a &s;oul freed from &s;illy and vile affections, and enrich|ed with a knowledge and love of God and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The trader mu&s;t propo&s;e to him&s;elf pro|per and rational ends of trading: for whoever pro|po&s;es to him&s;elf vain and fal&s;e ones, will entangle his life in manifold troubles and temptations, and lo&s;e his rea&s;on religion and tranquility, in the wind|ings and mazes of wretched fancies and unaccounta|ble projects. The ends of trading I take to be the&s;e: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> a competent and hone&s;t &s;upport of your|&s;elves and families. <HI>Secondly,</HI> a charitable &s;uccour and relief of others. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> a timely retreat from a &s;ecular calling, to a contemplative life.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A competent and hone&s;t &s;upport of your|&s;elves and families. This end is pointed out by the Apo&s;tle, Tit. 3.14. and called nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es, <HI>i.e.</HI> we mu&s;t de&s;ign in trade the &s;upport of the nece&s;&s;i|ties, not lu&s;ts of nature. And were not all trades over-&s;tocked, and con&s;equently the ob&s;ervation &s;u|perfluous, I &s;hould tell you, that public as well as private nece&s;&s;ities, were here to be under&s;tood. Nor is your care here limited to your own nece&s;&s;ities on|ly, but tho&s;e al&s;o for your children and po&s;terity demand their &s;hare in it; but then, le&s;t under this pretence you extend your de&s;ires beyond all bounds, you are to remember, that in re&s;olving the mea&s;ures

of this provi&s;ion, you are not to take coun&s;el of your own ambition, or the wanton expectations of your children; that provi&s;ion for them is wi&s;e&s;t, which lays a &s;ufficient foundation for their indu&s;try to build on, and leaves them under an obligation to bu&s;ine&s;s and employment. And is not this enough? to what purpo&s;e &s;hould men toil, cark, and pinch, to make their families rich and great, that is, lazy and wanton, to leave them an e&s;tate which their own example proves more than nece&s;&s;ary; for mo&s;t of tho&s;e that do &s;o, have made little u&s;e of it them|&s;elves: mi&s;take me not; I do not think it unlawful to be rich, or to leave one's family &s;o; but I think it fooli&s;h and &s;inful too, to &s;acrifice the peace of one's mind, and the ea&s;e of one's life, to the lu&s;t of rich|es: I think it &s;illy and vitious to rai&s;e a family by meanne&s;s and &s;ordidne&s;s, or to lay the foundation of children's greatne&s;s in one's infamy. In &s;hort it is not wealth but an inordinate pa&s;&s;ion for it, which I condemn: pro&s;perity is the gift of God, a common reward of Chri&s;tian virtues: for Chri&s;tianity is &s;aid to <HI>have the promi&s;es of this life and that which is to come.</HI> Wealth then may be received, but it mu&s;t not be de&s;igned as your fir&s;t and chief end. Thus fame, honour, and power, are great ble&s;&s;ings and favours of heaven; but whoever immoderately thir&s;ts after the one or the other is ambitious and vain glorious. You may receive temporal good things with gratitude, and enjoy them with mode|ration; but if you dote upon them, you violate the vow of your bapti&s;m, and virtually renounce your faith: for would not this be to forget that heaven were your kingdom and country, and earth the place of your exile, or, at be&s;t, pilgrimage? This is

that le&s;&s;on which cannot be too often inculcated: not only on the account of that violent oppo&s;ition it is almo&s;t every where encountred with&punc; but al&s;o the va&s;t importance it is of, to the quiet and content|ment of a trading life: this one thing is the philo&s;o|phy the trader &s;hould be ever &s;tudying, the wi&s;dom he &s;hould be daily pur&s;uing; that is, a true and ju&s;t moderation of his de&s;ires of wealth. Did man know how to bound his de&s;ires by the nece&s;&s;ities or conveniences of human life; could he regulate his appetites by the mode&s;ty and moderation of Chri&s;|tianity, not by cu&s;tom and fancy; I am confident, this one thing alone would re&s;cue him from the far greater part of evil incumbrances which infe&s;t hu|man life: vanity and ambition, envy and emulati|on wantonne&s;s and fancy, create mo&s;t of tho&s;e diffi|culties and nece&s;&s;ities which &s;tain the beauty, di&s;|turb the peace and order, and de&s;troy the plea&s;ure of life. When men's de&s;ires and aims are too big for their callings, they are unavoidably plunged into di&s;|content and doubtful projects; and if they &s;ink not finally into ruin, they cannot be held up but by &s;uch an anxious and re&s;tle&s;s per&s;ecution of the world, as looks rather like hurry or di&s;traction, than trade or employment. I can therefore never think a trade&s;|man happy, till he has mode&s;ty enough to find con|tent in the revenue of a moderate and ea&s;y trade; till he under&s;tands what are the bounds his nature and his &s;tation &s;ets him; tho' he know how to enjoy a great fortune, does never want one; has &s;en&s;e e|nough to u&s;e it, and virtue enough not to let his hap|pine&s;s depend upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> A charitable &s;uccor and relief of others.

It is confe&s;&s;ed by all, that men are born, not for them&s;elves only, but for others too; and God, the di&s;pen&s;er of temporal wealth, commands &s;uch as are rich in this world, to be rich in good works too: but it is always to be provided, that ju&s;tice do fir&s;t take place, and then charity. This direction there|fore &s;uppo&s;es the trader's accounts to &s;tand fair; it &s;uppo&s;es him to have di&s;charged the duties which he owes to his relatives and dependents, or el&s;e to have none. I will not in&s;i&s;t on the obligation or plea&s;ure of charity; I will not pre&s;s you to it by the intere&s;t of your pre&s;ent, and future happine&s;s: for the truth is, to do right to the trading world, there is no rank or order of men in the kingdom, that is more &s;en&s;ible of the duty of charity, or more inclin'd and di&s;po&s;ed to it; none that give more eminent proofs of it while living, or leave more glorious monuments of it be|hind them. One thing only I will take upon me to recommend to you; that is, the advice of <HI>Solomon; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> findeth to do, do it with thy might: for there is no work, nor device, nor know|ledge, nor wi&s;dom, in the grave whither thou goe&s;t:</HI> that is, whatever good you de&s;ign to do, do it &s;pee|dily as much as in you lies, be your own executors. How often are excellent purpo&s;es &s;trangled in the birth by an unexpected death! how frequently are they perverted by the corruption and negligence of tho&s;e to who&s;e in&s;pection they are committed! be|&s;ides, this way you &s;hall reap the fruit of your own plantations you will enjoy the plea&s;ure and &s;atisfac|tion re&s;ulting from the perfection, beauty, and good contrivance of the foundation you have laid; or you will be able to &s;upply the defects, or correct the er|rors of your model, and prevent tho&s;e future mi&s;car|riages
<PB N="18" REF="008643_0017_102FA5A2251560B0">
which &s;uch de&s;igns are liable to. Tho' all this be very much, yet it is but the lea&s;t part of what you will reap from being your&s;elves the executors of your own bounty; you will be &s;ure that you dedicate it to charity, not vanity; that you are building alms-hou&s;es for the living, not tombs and pyramids for the dead; you will e&s;cape the common cheat and im|po&s;ture the rich put upon them&s;elves while they in|tangle them&s;elves in covetou&s;ne&s;s all their lives, un|der pretence of de&s;igning mighty things after death.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The trade&s;man ought to propo&s;e to him|&s;elf a timely retreat, <HI>i. e.</HI> if the nece&s;&s;ities of this indigent &s;tate will give way to it; which &s;eems to me natural, to fini&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s before we fini&s;h life; to lay down our burthen before we tire and fall under the weight of it; and quit trouble&s;ome em|ployments, before our bungling di&s;charge of them proclaim the decay of our parts and &s;trength, and the increa&s;e of our avarice and ambition: nay, the very continuance of the &s;ame cares for the world, which looked before like prudence, will, in old age, be reckoned &s;in and folly. To trade, is but to make provi&s;ion for life; and therefore &s;ince com|mon &s;en&s;e will tell us, that we mu&s;t not be always providing for life, and never live; it is plain men ought, if they can, at length break off their trade, or at lea&s;t &s;o contract it, that it may be rather diver|&s;ion than labour. As <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ends us to the ants to learn indu&s;try, &s;o might he to learn wi&s;dom too; the enjoyment of their trea&s;ure in winter being no le&s;s an in&s;tance of the one, than their labour of lay|ing it up in the &s;ummer, of the other. Be&s;ides, in ripe years, the advice of the prophet &s;eems to be
<PB N="19" REF="008643_0018_102FA5A4EACE7730">
addre&s;&s;ed to every man: <HI>Set thy hou&s;e in order, for thou &s;halt die, and not live.</HI> State your accounts, &s;ettle your fortune, compo&s;e the differences of your family, and fix your children, &s;o that you may be able to di&s;cern what cour&s;e they will &s;teer when you are gone, and to correct any error they are apt to fall into, while you live, which may otherwi&s;e, when you are dead, prove incorrigible and de&s;truc|tive. If the&s;e motives, taken from decency, pru|dence and morality, &s;eem too light, there is an|other of more weight and moment behind; that is, the con&s;ideration of your eternal intere&s;t. It is highly nece&s;&s;ary to leave the world before you be torn from it, and to acquaint your&s;elves more fa|miliarly with another world, before you pa&s;s into it, to make your abode in it for ever. Certainly it re|quires &s;ome time to prepare the &s;oul for death and judgment; and that man will be very unfit for either, who is carried from the counter to the grave, and from the intanglements of &s;ecular cares to the tribu|nal of God. But be&s;ides the benefits which you will find in retirement, the pro&s;pect and propo&s;al of it has many in it; the hopes of a &s;abbatic year in life, will ea&s;e the weight and travail of tho&s;e that precede it; and a de&s;ign of retreating from trade and bu&s;i|ne&s;s, will be apt to induce men to pa&s;s their fir&s;t years with more moderation and ab&s;tinence, that they may the &s;ooner provide the means of an ea&s;y or ho|nourable retirement.</P>
<P>The&s;e rules well ob&s;erved, would free the negoti|ating life from all the great evils and inconvenien|ces it is &s;ubject to. Bu&s;ine&s;s, as it was in the time of innocence, would be, not the cur&s;e, but the ble&s;|&s;ing

of mankind; and trade would be as ea&s;y and in|nocent, if not as plea&s;ant, as <HI>Adam</HI>'s Hu&s;bandry in his garden: for thus indu&s;try would be without drudgery, and care without anxiety; commerce would be carried on without any mean or ill artifice, without impatient and tormenting de&s;igns, of tire|&s;ome and vexatious di&s;appointments. What need would there be of &s;hifts and equivocaitions, of fraud and circumvention, if a man had &s;aith enough to believe, that God's ble&s;&s;ing upon his indu&s;try were the only way to grow truly rich; I mean, to get, if not &s;o much as he would, yet as much as would be good for him? what temptation would men lie under to bondage and drudgery, or to perplexity and anx|iety, if he could contain his de&s;ires within tho&s;e nar|row bounds which nature and his &s;tation have pre|&s;cribed him? what fears could di&s;quiet the mind, which were formed into an intire re&s;ignation to, and dependence upon God? or, how could the world in|&s;nare that &s;oul, which allots a proper time for pub|lic religion, and private meditation? in a word, the&s;e rules being followed, men would not only avoid the common rocks on which the happine&s;s and fortune of the trader generally da&s;hes, but al&s;o attain the end of this &s;ort of active life&punc; they would get e&s;tates in their younger years, and enjoy them in their riper: nay, no portion of life would want its proper and &s;ea&s;onable enjoyments; they would in the mid&s;t of bu&s;ine&s;s pre&s;erve their innocence, and when they did retire from it, they would perfect that religion which they could before but begin; and enrich, and adorn, and entertain the &s;oul, which they could but guard and defend before, and &s;carcely maintain in life; I mean, &s;piritual life&punc;</P>
