<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE writer of the following &s;heets has thrown together a few facts, to obviate &s;ome mi&s;takes which have been embraced, re&s;pecting the Natives of this land; he neither wi&s;hes to flatter tho&s;e of his own colour by acknowledging that they are &s;uperior to the tawney Indian; otherwi&s;e than as they excel him in acts of bene&s;icence and of an imitation of the the great Author of the Chri&s;tian Religi|on; who&s;e name they have a&s;&s;umed; nor to exalt the character of the poor untu|tored Indian, at the expen&s;e of truth, by over-rating their cha&s;tity, their love of ju&s;tice, and ho&s;pitality; particularly in their affectionate reception of our An|ce&s;tors on their fir&s;t &s;ettlement of Penn|&s;ylvania; nor to &s;ay more in their favour than is &s;upported by the concurrent te&s;ti|monies of hi&s;torians of various religious profe&s;&s;ions and different nations.</P>
<P>Neither is it intended to ju&s;tify the&s;e people in any of their acts of cruelty:
<PB N="iv" REF="018356_0003_0FA6A315B5C7D668">The motives which have induced the wri|ter to engage in this publication are &s;upe|rior to party views; an apprehen&s;ion of duty, and univer&s;al good-will to mankind. And if the Indian is repre&s;ented to have been oppre&s;&s;ed and injured, it is not to provoke a &s;pirit of retaliation, nor to ex|cite a di&s;content, but to &s;tate to the view of the public, wherein they have been aggrieved; and wherein they have been culpable, that the people of the&s;e &s;tates may &s;ee they have not been free from blame, in hopes that a more candid and indulgent con&s;ideration of their &s;itua|tion may excite in us humanity and ten|derne&s;s.</P>
<P>Be not offended therefore if the Indian is repre&s;ented as a rational being as well as our&s;elves, if having an immortal &s;oul, capable of receiving the refining influ|ence of our holy religion, it is that he may be allowed to dwell in &s;afety, and re|joice in the opportunity, which a return of peace, may afford to in&s;truct him in the knowledge of the true God.</P>
<P>If doubts &s;hould remain, whether the Indians are, indeed &s;u&s;ceptible of tho&s;e religious impre&s;&s;ions as here mentioned; the reader is referred to the &s;everal ac|counts of the &s;ucce&s;sful labours of the pi|ous

<HEAD>SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE <HI>INDIAN NATIVES</HI> OF THIS CONTINENT.</HEAD>
<P>SITUATE as we are on this Con|tinent with very exten&s;ive frontiers, bordering upon a va&s;t wilderne&s;s, inha|bited by the native Indians, it becomes a &s;ubject worthy the mo&s;t &s;erious attention of every friend of mankind, every lover of his country, to be truly informed what is the &s;ituation and di&s;po&s;ition of that people, &s;o far as it may have an influence upon our duty as Chri&s;tians, and our peace and &s;afety as members of Civil So|ciety: And that we may not make a ra&s;h
<PB N="7" REF="018356_0006_0FA6A31C9F840DE0">e&s;timate of our own importance, or of the incapacity of tho&s;e people for religi|ous improvement, the following ob&s;erva|tions and quotations are recommended to the &s;erious peru&s;al of every reader, as they give a view of the opinions of &s;ome of the early &s;ettlers, of different deno|minations, in this continent.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ettlers of Penn&s;ylvania, who had full opportunities of being acquaint|ed with the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of the Natives, and who made it a principal point to ob&s;erve &s;trict ju&s;tice in all their tran&s;actions with them, have left us very favourable memorials of the long conti|nued kindne&s;s they experienced from the&s;e people: the great di&s;advantages to which their ignorance and roving temper &s;ubjected them, our forefathers thought it their duty to endeavour to draw them from, by exemplary acts of benevolence and in&s;truction; which pious practice has &s;ince been &s;ucce&s;sfully pur&s;ued, by &s;everal well di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons in New-Eng|land, New-Jer&s;ey, and el&s;ewhere: &s;eve|ral of whom have tran&s;mitted &s;atisfactory accounts of their labours.</P>
<P>From the&s;e publications as well as from the remembrance of &s;ome yet living, it is evident, that the natural di&s;po&s;ition of
<PB N="8" REF="018356_0007_0FA6A31D3B469F20">the Indians has generally been to &s;hew kindne&s;s to the Europeans, in their early &s;ettlements; and that their mental pow|ers are equally with our own capable of improvement; that the apparent differ|ence in them, as well as in the Black Peo|ple and us, ari&s;es principally from the advantages of our education, and man|er of life.</P>
<P>Some writers have repre&s;ented Indians as naturally ferocious, treacherous, and ungrateful, and endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h this character of them, from &s;ome parti|cular tran&s;action which hath happened on &s;pecial occa&s;ions: but no conclu&s;ion of their original character &s;hould be drawn from in&s;tances in which they have been provoked, to a degree of fury and ven|geance, by unju&s;t and cruel treatment from European Aggre&s;&s;ors; of which mo&s;t hi&s;tories of the fir&s;t &s;ettlements on this continent furni&s;h in&s;tances, and which writers have endeavoured to co|lour and vindicate, by reprobating the character of tho&s;e poor people.</P>
<P>It is a matter of fact, proved by mo&s;t Hi&s;torical Accounts of the trade carried on with the Indians at our fir&s;t acquaint|ance with them, as well as in the fir&s;t &s;ettlements made on this continent, that
<PB N="9" REF="018356_0008_0FA6A31E12A2B8B0">they generally manife&s;ted them&s;elves to be kind, ho&s;pitable and generous to the Europeans, &s;o long as they were treated with ju&s;tice and humanity; but when the adventurers from a thir&s;t of gain, over reached the Natives, and they faw &s;ome of their friends and relations treacherou&s;ly entrapped and carried away to be &s;old for &s;laves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among&s;t the many in&s;tances of this kind which might be given, that are recorded by dif|ferent authors, the following is mo&s;t &s;triking, viz. One Hunt, an early trader with the Indians of New-England, after a pro&s;perous trade with the Natives, enticed between 20 or 30 on board his ve&s;&s;el, and contrary to the public faith, clapped them under hatches, and &s;old them to the Spa|niards at Malaga; but the Indians re&s;ented it, and revenged them&s;elves on the next Engli&s;h that came on the coa&s;t. Neal's Hi&s;tory of New-Eng|land, page 21.</NOTE> them&s;elves injuri|ou&s;ly treated and driven from their na|tive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, what could be expected but that &s;uch a &s;ordid conduct in the Eu|ropeans, would produce a change of di&s;|po&s;ition in the Indians. The early &s;et|tlers of New-Jer&s;ey have always confirm|ed the te&s;timony of the Penn&s;ylvanians, with re&s;pect to the good u&s;age they met
<PB N="10" REF="018356_0009_0FA6A31EB6BED4E0">with from the Indians. The writer of the Hi&s;tory of that Province informs us, page 440, <Q>That, for almo&s;t a centu|ry, the Natives had all along maintain|ed an intercour&s;e of great cordiality and friend&s;hip with the inhabitants.</Q></P>
<P>It is well known that the Indians' de|portment to each other is peaceable and inoffen&s;ive; e&s;teeming &s;udden anger un|becoming and ignominious; they &s;eldom differ with their neighbour, or do them any harm or injury, except when intoxi|cated by &s;trong liquor, of which they are fond, to an enormous degree: this is the general character given of Indians, by all impartial writers.</P>
<P>The noted French author Charlevoix, who appears to have been deep in his in|quiries into their manners and di&s;po&s;iti|on, in his long travels from Quebec, thro' the lakes and down the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi to Flo|rida, informs, <Q>That with a mein and appearance altogether &s;avage; and with manners and cu&s;toms which fa|vour the greate&s;t barbarity, the Indi|ans enjoy all the advantages of &s;ociety. At fir&s;t view, &s;ays he, one would ima|gine them without form of govern|ment, law or &s;ubordination, and &s;ub|ject to the wilde&s;t caprice; neverthe|le&s;s,
<PB N="11" REF="018356_0010_0FA6A32259C30438">they rarely deviate from certain maxims and u&s;ages founded on good &s;en&s;e alone, which holds the place of law, and &s;upplies in &s;ome &s;ort, the want of legal authority. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Human Nature, even in its rude&s;t &s;tate, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of right and wrong; a pure principle which is not confined to any name or form, but diffu&s;es it&s;elf as univer&s;ally as the &s;un; it is <Q><HI>That light which enlightens every man coming into the world.</HI></Q> John i. 9. All tho&s;e who vield to its impre&s;&s;ions are brethren in the full extent of the expre&s;&s;ion, however differing in other re&s;pects.</NOTE> Rea&s;on alone is capable of retaining them in a kind of &s;ubordination; not the le&s;s effectual, towards the end propo&s;ed, for being entirely voluntary. They manife&s;t much &s;tability in the engage|ments they have &s;olemnly entered up|on; patient in affliction, as well as in their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to what they appre|hend to be the appointment of Provi|dence; in all which they manife&s;t a noblene&s;s of &s;oul, and con&s;tancy of mind, at which we rarely arrive with all our Philo&s;ophy and Religion. As they are neither &s;laves to ambition, nor
<PB N="12" REF="018356_0011_0FA6A324A8FB2E30">intere&s;t; the two pa&s;&s;ions which have &s;o much weakened in us tho&s;e &s;enti|ments of humanity, which the kind Author of Nature has engraven in the human heart, and kindled tho&s;e of co|vetou&s;ne&s;s, which are as yet generally unknown among&s;t them.</Q></P>
<P>Is it not notorious that they are gene|rally kinder to us than we are to them? There is &s;carce an in&s;tance occurs, but that they treat every white man, who comes among&s;t them, with re&s;pect; which is not the ca&s;e from us to them.</P>
<P>Their mode&s;t conduct to women who have been captured by them, is certainly worthy of commendation, much exceed|ing what would be expected, in like ca&s;es, from the lower cla&s;s among&s;t our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o acknowledged by all impar|tial per&s;ons, who have been conver&s;ant with Indians, that they have generally manife&s;ted a faithfulne&s;s to the engage|ments they have entered into for the &s;afe|ty of any per&s;on they have undertaken to protect, far exceeding that to be found among&s;t the generality of white people; as al&s;o in the performance of tho&s;e cove|nants which they have confirmed by giv|ing belts of wampum.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="018356_0012_0FA6A3262CFB80C0">
Charlevoix farther ob&s;erves, <Q>That whoever in&s;inuates him&s;elf in their e&s;teem, will &s;ind them &s;ufficiently do|cile to do any thing he de&s;ires; but that this is not ea&s;ily gained, as they generally give it to merit only, of which they are as good judges as mo&s;t among&s;t us. He adds, that the&s;e good di&s;po&s;itions are very much eclip&s;ed by the cruelty they &s;ometimes exerci&s;e upon &s;uch of their enemies, whom they have devoted to death; as well as the right they almo&s;t univer&s;ally claim to private revenge. They con&s;ider it as a point of honour to avenge inju|ries done to their friends, particular|ly the death of a relation; blood for blood, death for death, can only &s;a|tisfy the &s;urviving friends of the inju|red party.</Q> Something of the &s;ame law of retaliation was u&s;ual among&s;t the ancient Jews and Romans.</P>
<P>From this principle, as well as from the high notions they have of military glory, the young Indians &s;ometimes &s;ud|denly pur&s;ue violent mea&s;ures, contrary to the mind of their elders.</P>
<P><Q>It is, &s;ays the &s;ame Author, a feel|ing experience of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion, which alone is able to perfect
<PB N="14" REF="018356_0013_0FA6A3264DE7C8B0">their good qualities, and correct that which is wrong in them; this is com|mon to them with other men; but what is peculiar to them is, that they bring fewer ob&s;tacles to this improve|ment, after, thro' the operation of grace, they have once began to believe in the great truths of the go&s;pel.</Q></P>
<P>The good di&s;po&s;ition of the more &s;outh|ern Indians is &s;en&s;ibly &s;et forth by De las Ca&s;as, Bi&s;hop of Chapia, who &s;pent much time and labour in endeavouring to pre|&s;erve the Indians of New-Spain, from the grievous oppre&s;&s;ion they laboured under, in his repre&s;entation to the King and Council of Spain, which, with little va|riation, may well be applied to the na|tives of mo&s;t parts of the continent. He &s;ays, <Q>I was one of the fir&s;t who went to America, neither curio&s;ity nor intere&s;t prompted me to undertake &s;o long and dangerous a voyage; the &s;aving the &s;ouls of the Heathens was my &s;ole object. Why was I not per|mitted, even at the expen&s;e of my blood, to ran&s;om &s;o many thou&s;ands of &s;ouls who fell unhappy victims to avarice or lu&s;t.&mdash;It is &s;aid, that barbarous executions were nece&s;&s;ary to puni&s;h or check the rebellion of the
<PB N="15" REF="018356_0014_0FA6A32705788B10">Americans; but to whom was this owing? did not tho&s;e people receive the Spaniards who fir&s;t came among&s;t them, with gentlene&s;s and humanity? did they not &s;hew more joy, in pro|portion, in lavi&s;hing trea&s;ure upon them, than the Spaniards did greedi|ne&s;s in receiving it?&mdash;but our ava|rice was not yet &s;atisfied&mdash;tho' they gave up to us their land and their riches, we would take from them their wives, their children, and their liber|ty.&mdash;To blacken the&s;e unhappy people, their enemies a&s;&s;ert, that they are &s;carce human creatures&mdash;but it is we ought to blu&s;h for having been le&s;s men, and more barbarous than they.&mdash;They are repre&s;ented as a &s;tupid people, addicted to vice;&mdash; but have they not contracted mo&s;t of their vices from the examples of Chri|&s;tians? And as to tho&s;e vices peculiar to them&s;elves, have not the Chri&s;tians quickly exceeded them therein? Ne|verthele&s;s it mu&s;t be granted, that the Indians &s;till remain untainted with ma|ny vices, u&s;ual among&s;t the Europe|ans; &s;uch as ambition, bla&s;phemy, treachery, and many like mon&s;ters, which have not yet took place with
<PB N="16" REF="018356_0015_0FA6A327B8F4F2A8">them; they have &s;carce an idea of them, &s;o that, in effect, all the advan|tage we can claim, is to have more elevated notions of things, and our faculties more unfolded, and more cultivated than theirs.&mdash;Don't let us &s;latter our corruptions, nor volunta|rily blind our&s;elves; all nations are equally free: one nation has no right to infringe upon the freedom of ano|ther: let us do towards tho&s;e people, as we would have them to have done to us, if they had landed upon our &s;hore, with the &s;ame &s;uperiority of &s;trength. And, indeed, why &s;hould not things be equal on both &s;ides. How long has the right of the &s;trong|e&s;t been allowed to be the balance of ju&s;tice. What part of the Go&s;pel gives a &s;anction to &s;uch a doctrine. In what part of the whole earth did the Apo&s;tles and fir&s;t promulgators of the Go&s;pel, ever claim a right over the lives, the freedom, or the &s;ub&s;tance of the Gentiles. What a &s;trange me|thod this of propagating the Go&s;pel, that holy law of grace, which from being &s;laves to &s;atan, initiates us into the freedom of the children of God.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="018356_0016_0FA6A328989503B8">
To this pious Bi&s;hop's te&s;timony, may be added that of Page Dup<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">, in his Hi&s;tory of Loui&s;iana, who during a re&s;i|dence of &s;ixteen years, appears to have been careful in his enquiries, relating to the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e &s;e|veral nations &s;eated in a &s;pace of 1500 miles on both &s;ides the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi, with &s;ome of whom he was intimately con|ver&s;ant, whom he repre&s;ents as generally endowed with good &s;en&s;e, kindne&s;s and moderation. He tells us, <Q>That upon an acquaintance with the Indians, he was convinced that it is wrong to de|nominate them Savages, as they are ca|pable of making a good u&s;e of their rea&s;on, and their &s;entiments are ju&s;t; that they have a degree of prudence, faithfulne&s;s and genero&s;ity, exceeding that of nations who would be offended at being compared with them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No people, he &s;ays, are more ho|&s;pitable and free than the Indians; hence they might be e&s;teemed an hap|py people, if that happine&s;s was not impeded by their pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s for &s;pirituous liquors, and the fooli&s;h notion they hold in common, with many profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, of gaining reputation and e&s;teem, by their prow|e&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="018356_0017_0FA6A32B3691F498">in war:</Q> both which potent evils, have from views of policy or intere&s;t, been much encouraged by their Eu|ropean neighbours."</P>
<P>From him, as al&s;o from &s;ome other au|thors, we learn that &s;ome of the&s;e nations appear but little inclined to war, and there are others who ab&s;olutely refu&s;e to take any part therein, but patiently bear the hard|&s;hips which the violence of other Indians &s;ubjects them to; of which good di&s;|po&s;ition we have had in&s;tances among&s;t our&s;elves in the ca&s;e of the Moravian In|dians.</P>
<P>Dupratz ob&s;erves upon the whole, <Q>That there needs but prudence and good &s;en&s;e, to per&s;uade the Indians to what is rea&s;onable, and to pre&s;erve their friend&s;hip without interruption. He adds, We may &s;afely affirm that the differences we have had with them, have been more owing to us than to them. When they are treated in&s;o|lently or oppre&s;&s;ively, they have no le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility of injuries than others. If tho&s;e who have occa&s;ion to live among them, will have &s;entiments of hu|manity, they will meet in them with men.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="018356_0018_0FA6A32FF599AA18">
Many more authors might be quoted, declarative of the commendable qualities which have appeared in the Indians, whil&s;t uncorrupted by an intercour&s;e with the Europeans, and which is &s;till the ca&s;e in the di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e nations &s;ituated at a di&s;tance from us. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note, In a late Hi&s;tory of the Briti&s;h Domi|nions in North-America, printed in 1773, p. 219, the Author &s;peaking of the Natives, &s;ays, <Q>The nearer the Indians of Canada are viewed, the more good qualities are di&s;covered in them; for mo&s;t of the principles which &s;erve to regu|late their conduct; the general maxims by which they govern them&s;elves; and the e&s;&s;en|tial parts of their character, di&s;cover nothing of the barbarian.</Q>
<P>Of the Five Nation Indians, M. Delapoterie. a French Author, (wherein he very much agrees with Cadwalader Colden, late pre&s;ident of New-York) in his account of tho&s;e Indians, &s;ays, <Q>They are thought by a common mi&s;take, to be mere barbarians, always thir&s;ting for human blood; but their true character is very differ|ent: they are indeed the fierce&s;t and mo&s;t for|midable people in North-America; and at the &s;ame time, as politic and judicious, as well can be conceived, which appears from the management of all the affairs they tran&s;act, not only with the French and Engli&s;h, but likewi&s;e with almo&s;t all the Indian Nations of this va&s;t continent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Speaking of the Cherokees, and other South|ern Indians, page 157, he &s;ays, The&s;e Indi|ans look upon the end of life, to be living happily; and for this purpo&s;e, their whole cu&s;toms are calculated to prevent avarice, which they think imbitters life; and nothing is a more &s;evere reflection among&s;t them, than to &s;ay, <HI>That a man loves his own.</HI> To prevent the ri&s;e and propagation of &s;uch a vice, upon the death of any Indian, they burn all that be|longs to the decea&s;ed, that there may be no temptation for the parent to hoard up a &s;u|perfluity of arms, and dome&s;tic conveniences for his children. They &s;trengthen this cu|&s;tom, by a &s;uper&s;tition, that it is agreeable to the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed, to burn all they leave, and that affliction follow tho&s;e who u&s;e any of their goods. They cultivate no more land than is nece&s;&s;ary for their plentiful &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and ho&s;pitality to &s;trangers.</Q></P></NOTE> This particu|larly

<P>Whil&s;t in the Indian Country, he was in&s;trumental in preventing the Chipeways and Nadowe&s;&s;is Indians from pro&s;ecuting the war, which had during a cour&s;e of 40 years, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them. This, the old Indians told him, they had long wi&s;hed to put an end to; but that their endeavours were fru&s;trated by the young warriors, of either nation, who could not re&s;train their ardour when they met. They &s;aid they &s;hould be happy, if &s;ome chief of the &s;ame pacific di&s;po&s;ition as him&s;elf, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an equal de|gree of re&s;olution and coolne&s;s, would &s;ettle in the country between the two na|tions; for by the interference of &s;uch a per&s;on, an accommodation, which, on their part, they &s;incerely de&s;ired might be brought about. From this circum&s;tance, as well as what Duprat and others ob&s;erve of the peaceable di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome of the Indians, we may well conclude, that &s;u&s;ceptible as tho&s;e untutored people are, to the dictates of rea&s;on, if the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity had, by a proper u&s;e of that &s;uperior knowledge they were fa|voured with, hone&s;tly laboured, thro'

<P>The fir&s;t gathering of tho&s;e Indians in|to a good degree of civil and religious order, was about 30 years ago, by means of one of them, named Papunhank. The place of their re&s;idence at that time, was at Whihaloo&s;ing, on the Su&s;quehan|na, about 200 miles from Philadelphia. In the conver&s;ation they had with &s;ome &s;erious people, in a vi&s;it to that city, about the year 1756, at a time when the province was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the Indian war, they appeared to have a feeling &s;en&s;e of that inward change of heart which the Go&s;pel requires, and declared their par|ticular di&s;approbation of war, and fixed re&s;olution to take no part therein; appre|hending it to be di&s;plea&s;ing to the Great Being, who, as one of them expre&s;&s;ed it, <Q>Did not make men to de&s;troy men; but to love and a&s;&s;i&s;t each other.</Q> They held a conference with the Governor,
<PB N="25" REF="018356_0024_0FA6A33567B38B30">in which they informed him, <Q>That they remembered the old friend&s;hip which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between their Forefa|thers and ours; that they were great lovers of peace, and had not taken any part in the war.</Q></P>
<P>They delivered three white pri&s;oners which they had recovered from the other Indians. They de&s;ired that no &s;trong drink &s;hould be given them, nor be &s;ent to their town. The &s;peaker, Papun|hank, appeared &s;erious, as under a &s;en&s;e of the Divine Pre&s;ence, and concluded with a &s;olemn prayer, with which the whole audience &s;eemed much affected.</P>
<P>About 13 years pa&s;t, the&s;e Indians meeting with difficulty, from an en|crea&s;e of White Settlers near them, by which &s;pirituous liquors were brought to their towns; they removed to the Mu&s;kingum, a branch of the Ohio. In their perigrination thither, they were ac|companied by &s;ome of the Moravians, who have long re&s;ided with them, and by their careful attention, both to their civil and religious concerns, never leav|ing them, even in the times of their great|e&s;t danger and difficulty, a near and &s;teady connection between them took place.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="018356_0025_0FA6A335F6354DD8">
<P>During the late troubles, the&s;e Indians adhering to the principles they had long profe&s;&s;ed, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to take any part in the war, notwith&s;tanding the threats and repeated abu&s;es they received on that account from other tribes, par|ticularly tho&s;e parties which pa&s;&s;ed thro' their towns, in their way to our fron|tiers; whom they &s;ometimes di&s;&s;uaded from their ho&s;tile intentions, and pre|vailed upon to go back again; or warn|ed the inhabitants of their danger. This humane conduct being con&s;idered as ob&s;tructive to the ho&s;tile proceedings of the Tribes at war, was at length made the pretence of carrying them off. Ac|cordingly, on the 4th of Augu&s;t, 1781, a &s;tring of Wampum was &s;ent by the Chief of the Wyondats, who re&s;ided at Sandu&s;ky, with a me&s;&s;age, letting them know, He was coming with a number of warriors; but biding them be not afraid, for he was their friend. In a few days after, 220 warriors arrived, when call|ing a council of the head men of the three Moravian towns, they acquainted them they were come to take them away; ren|dering it for a rea&s;on, <Q>That they, and their Indians, were a great ob&s;truction to them in their war-path.</Q> They re|turned
<PB N="27" REF="018356_0026_0FA6A339040B6298">them this an&s;wer: <Q>That it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to remove at that time, and leave their corn behind them, le&s;t they and their children &s;hould pe|ri&s;h with hunger in the wilderne&s;s.</Q> To this, the Chief of the Wyondats, at fir&s;t, &s;eemed to attend; but being in&s;ti|gated by &s;ome white men in their com|pany, they per&s;i&s;ted in their re&s;olution; and after killing many of the cattle and hogs, ripping up their bedding, and committing many other outrages, on the 28th of Augu&s;t, and September, forced them from their three towns, in all be|tween 3 and 400 per&s;ons; who, after a tedious journey in the wilderne&s;s, arrived at a branch of Sandu&s;ky creek, where the body of them were ordered to re|main. Some of their principal men were &s;ent to Major Arent Schuyler De Pey|&s;ter, the Engli&s;h Commander at fort De|troit, who commended them, as a peace|able people, and exhorted them to re|main &s;uch; but added, That many com|plaints had been made of them; that they had given intelligence to his ene|mies, &amp;c. he had &s;ent for them; but that his in&s;tructions had been exceeded, in the ill-treatment they had received; that however he would provide for them.
<PB N="28" REF="018356_0027_0FA6A339B7785910">Thus the matter re&s;ted till the &s;pring, 1782, when the&s;e Moravian Indians fin|ding corn &s;carce and dear at Sandu&s;ky, de&s;ired liberty to return to their &s;ettle|ments, to fetch &s;ome of their corn, of which they had le&s;t above 200 acres &s;tanding; which when granted, many of them went, among whom were &s;eve|ral widows with their children, &s;ome of whom had been &s;ubjected to &s;uch ex|treme want, as to eat the carca&s;es of the dead cattle and hor&s;es.</P>
<P>When the people at and about the Mo|nongahela, under&s;tood a number of Indi|ans were at the Moravian towns, they gave out, that the intention of tho&s;e people was, to fall upon the back inhabitants, which ought to be prevented. Where|upon about 160 men got together, and &s;wimming their hor&s;es over the Ohio, came &s;uddenly upon the chief Moravian town. The fir&s;t per&s;on who appeared, they &s;hot at and wounded, when coming up to him, they found he was an half Indian, &s;on to John Bull, one of the Moravians, by an Indian woman, to whom he is regularly married; they killed and &s;calped him, and proceeded to the town. The Moravian Indians, who were mo&s;tly in the fields pulling
<PB N="29" REF="018356_0028_0FA6A33A86EF67E8">corn, did not run off, as many of them might, if they had been con&s;cious of any offence; but came of their own accord, into the town, at the call of the white people, who at fir&s;t, expre&s;&s;ed friend&s;hip to them; but &s;oon after, violently &s;eized and bound them, when the Helpers, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are Indians who a&s;&s;i&s;t the mi&s;&s;iona|ries in keeping good order among&s;t their people, and upon occa&s;ion, give public exhortations.</NOTE> of whom there were five of the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable, in the company, and others exhorted the younger, to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and patience; telling them, they thought their troubles in this world, would &s;oon be at an end, and they would be with their Saviour. They then &s;ung and pray|ed together, till they were led out, one after the other, and inhumanly &s;laughter|ed; fir&s;t the men, and then the women. Two boys, who made their e&s;cape, relat|ed the&s;e particulars. One of them lay in the heap of the dead, in a hou&s;e, and was &s;calped; but recovering his &s;en&s;es, e&s;caped: the other, who had hid him&s;elf under the floor, was an eye-witne&s;s of this tragic &s;cene, and &s;aw the blood of
<PB N="30" REF="018356_0029_0FA6A33C72652B38">the &s;lain running in a &s;tream. The&s;e Indi|ans before being bound, were &s;o little ap|prehen&s;ive of being charged with guilt, that they informed the White People, that more of their brethren were at another town to which they accompanied them; who in like manner fell a &s;acrifice with them, to the barbarity of the whites. The dead bodies were afterwards burned with the hou&s;es. Before their death, they were al&s;o obliged to &s;hew in what part of the woods they had concealed their effects, when the other Indians (as before mentioned) took them away.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e at the third town having &s;ome intelligence of what pa&s;&s;ed, made their e&s;cape. One of the Helpers, who e&s;cap|ed relates, That in a conference they had with the other Helpers, when they con|&s;idered what they &s;hould do in ca&s;e of an attack, either from the Americans, or the Indians, who had taken part with the Engli&s;h, &s;ome of whom charged them of having, thro' the intelligence they gave to the Virginians, been the occa&s;ion of the &s;laughter of their brethren, at Go&s;chaching; the re&s;ult of their confer|ence was, <Q>Not to go away, neverthele&s;s to leave each one to act according to the feeling of his own heart. He added,
<PB N="31" REF="018356_0030_0FA6A340940A7288">That there was &s;o much love among&s;t them, that he had never felt the like before.</Q> This is a &s;ummary of this dreadful tran&s;action, as it is given by the principle leader of tho&s;e that remain.</P>
<P>The Account, as it &s;tands in the Penn|&s;ylvania Gazette, of April 17th, 1782, after giving an account of the incur&s;ions of the Indians, adds, <Q>That the peo|ple being greatly alarmed, and having received intelligence that the Indian towns, on the Mu&s;kingum, had not moved as they had been told&mdash;a number of men properly provided, col|lected and rendevou&s;ed on the Ohio, oppo&s;ite the Mingo Bottom, with a de&s;ign to &s;urpri&s;e the above towns &mdash;160 men &s;wam the river, and proceeded to the towns on the Mu&s;|kingum, where the Indians had col|lected a large quantity of provi&s;ions to &s;upply their war-parties. They ar|rived at the town in the night, undi&s;|covered, attacked the Indians in their cabbins, and &s;o completely &s;urpri&s;ed them, that they killed and &s;calped upwards of 90, but a few making their e&s;cape, about 40 of which were warriors, the re&s;t old women and chil|dren. About 80 hor&s;es fell into their
<PB N="32" REF="018356_0031_0FA6A3420A8EB688">hands, which they loaded with the plunder, the greate&s;t part furrs and &s;kins; and returned to the Ohio, without the lo&s;s of one man.</Q></P>
<P>It is alledged, in vindication of this deliberate ma&s;&s;acre, that 40 of tho&s;e In|dians were warriors, preparing to attack our frontiers; but this a&s;&s;ertion contra|dicts it &s;elf: for had it been the ca&s;e, it is not likely they would have brought their wives, with the widows, and 34 children, who were &s;lain with them, or have &s;uffered them with them&s;elves, to be thus murdered, without making the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, or hurt to their murderers.</P>
<P>Soon after the death of the&s;e Indians, about 500 men, probably encouraged by this ea&s;y conque&s;t a&s;&s;embled at the old Min|gos on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Ohio, and being equipped, on hor&s;eback, &s;et on for San|du&s;ky, where the remaining part of the Moravian Indians re&s;ided, in order to de&s;troy that &s;ettlement, and other Indian towns in tho&s;e parts; but the Wyandots, and other Indians, having &s;ome know|ledge of their approach, met them near Sandu&s;ky, when an engagement en&s;ued, in which &s;ome of the a&s;&s;ailants were kill|ed, and &s;everal taken pri&s;oners, among&s;t whom was the Commander Col. Craw|ford,
<PB N="33" REF="018356_0032_0FA6A342C3C51298">and his &s;on-in-law. The Col. the Indians put to a cruel death, and killed the other, with other pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s the cruelty exerci&s;ed on the Col. and the death of the pri&s;oners taken at Sandu&s;ky, was, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the murder of the peaceable Moravian Indians, at which they expre&s;&s;|ed much di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This grievous tran&s;action appears in a yet more afflictive point of view, when it is con&s;idered, that tho' many threats had been thrown out again&s;t tho&s;e Indi|ans, both by the Engli&s;h and Ameri|cans, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the Wyondat King in his Speech told them, <Q>My cou&s;ins, you Chri&s;tian Indians, in Gnadenhutten, Shoenbrun and Salem.

But &s;uch is the corrupting nature of war, that it gradu|ally hardens the heart, to a fearful de|gree of in&s;en&s;ibility. Yet &s;urely a time of rou&s;ing mu&s;t come, when, if not giv|en up to obduracy, equal to their delu&s;i|on, the blood of the&s;e innocent people will be heavy upon all concerned in the &s;hedding of it.</P>
<P>We cry out again&s;t Indian cruelty; but is any thing which Indians have done, (all circum&s;tances con&s;idered) more in|con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, rea&s;on, and hu|manity, than the murder of tho&s;e Mora|vian Indians; a peaceable, innocent peo|ple, who&s;e conduct, even when under the &s;calping-knife, evidenced a depend|ance on Divine Help for &s;upport, as much becoming Chri&s;tians, as their &s;ufferings in &s;upport of their religious principles,
<PB N="35" REF="018356_0034_0FA6A345F6B8A2F0">and their fidelity to the government had before manife&s;ted them to be our &s;pecial friends.</P>
<P>In vindication of this barbarous tran&s;|action, endeavours have been u&s;ed, to make us believe, that the whole race of Indians are a people prone to every vice, and de&s;titute of every virtue; and with|out a capacity for improvement. What is this but bla&s;phemou&s;ly to arraign the wi&s;dom of our Creator, and in&s;inuate, that the exi&s;tence He has given them, is incompatible with his moral government of the world. But this mu&s;t be admitted to make way for the propo&s;al of endea|vouring the univer&s;al extirpation of In|dians from the face of the earth. Such, alas! is the manner in which too many of the pretended followers, of the meek and &s;uffering Saviour of the world, would fulfil the prophecy concerning him, <Q><HI>That he &s;hall have the Heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t Parts of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI></Q> And who him&s;elf declared, <Q><HI>That he came not to de&s;troy mens' lives, but to &s;ave them;</HI></Q> and when fainting in his la&s;t agony, un|der mockery and deri&s;ion, conceived at once a prayer, and an apology for his murderers: <Q><HI>Father, forgive them, they
<PB N="36" REF="018356_0035_0FA6A34A803CCA80">know not what they do.</HI></Q> Now &s;o far as we know the prevailance of this &s;pirit of love and forgivene&s;s, over the pride and warth of our hearts, &s;o far are we the di&s;ciples and followers of Chri&s;t; and &s;o far only, can we truly pray for, and witne&s;s the coming of His kingdom: and on the other hand, &s;o far as we are &s;ubject to a vindictive and unforgiving &s;pirit, &s;o far we are in a &s;tate of alie|nation from God, and reprobate con|cerning a true faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which works only by love, to the purifying of the heart from every di&s;po|&s;ition of a contrary nature. Was this di&s;tinction always ob&s;erved in our religi|ous di&s;criminations of mankind, we &s;hould get thro' abundance of frivolous and &s;uperficial prejudices which divide the Chri&s;tian World, and be convinced, that it is not the colour of our &s;kins, out ward circum&s;tances or profe&s;&s;ion, but the &s;tate and temper of the mind and will, which makes us Jews or Gentiles; Chri&s;tians or Heathens; Elect or Repro|bate, in the &s;ight of God. That this change of heart is the &s;ure effect of the coming of Chri&s;t's kingdom, was evi|denced in many of tho&s;e Indians, who&s;e ca&s;e is here repre&s;ented; who, by yield|ing
<PB N="37" REF="018356_0036_0FA6A34BA83A81F8">to the operations of Divine Grace, were brought to an entire reformation of mind and manners. That &s;avage feroci|ty, with all tho&s;e dazzling notions of ho|nour, to be gained from the de&s;truction of mankind, &s;o natural to the fallen &s;ons of Adam, have gradually melted away in the&s;e Indians, into a frame of meek|ne&s;s, humility and love, which &s;up|ported them in that lamb-like &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, under that remarkable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of trials and afflictions which was permitted to at|tend them; whereby many of them are at length put beyond the reach of enmi|ty.</P>
<P>We are told by a late Author, who appears zealous for the extirpation of all Indians, <Q><HI>That for a keg of whi&s;key, you might induce any Indian to murder his wife, children and be&s;t friend.</HI></Q> That this is not a ju&s;t character of Indi|ans, all, who are acquainted with that people, can te&s;tify: yet there are, doubt|le&s;s, ill-di&s;po&s;ed people among&s;t them, as well as among&s;t us, who under the dread|ful power of &s;trong drink, (which has an uncommon bad effect on them) may be led into the greate&s;t enormities. Never|thele&s;s, as has been mentioned, impar|tial men, who from good views, have
<PB N="38" REF="018356_0037_0FA6A34BB9303A70">vi&s;ited or re&s;ided with them, repre&s;ent them in a very different light: as Char|levoix, and other French and Spani&s;h Authors: John Elliott, Thomas Mayew; John Sergeant, in New-England; David Brainard and others in the Jer&s;eys; and more lately the Moravians in different parts. The&s;e have &s;pent much time and labour for the civil and religious improve|ment of the Natives, in which they all expre&s;&s;ed &s;atisfaction and comfort.</P>
<P>And it is worthy of peculiar notice, that in the wars the Indians have waged upon our frontiers, there has &s;carce been an in&s;tance of any of tho&s;e Indians, who had made a &s;erious profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Religion, having been concern|ed in the barbarous eruptions again&s;t us. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neal, p. 30, 2d. vol. &s;ays, <Q>There is one thing which de&s;erves to be taken notice of; that is, the un&s;haken fidelity of the Indian Converts, during the whole cour&s;e of the war, whom nei|ther per&s;ua&s;ion nor threatnings of their coun|trymen, could draw from their allegiance to the Engli&s;h.

<P>The &s;ame Author ob&s;erves, That the govern|ment was &s;o well &s;atisfied with the fidelity of the Indians, that in&s;tead of di&s;arming them, as was de&s;ired, the Indians on Martha's Vineyard, who were twenty to one in number to the White People, continued &s;o faithful to their engage|ments, that they were &s;upplied with all &s;orts of ammunition, and the defence of the I&s;land com|mitted to their care; and &s;o faithful were they to their tru&s;t, that all people that landed upon the I&s;land, during the cour&s;e of the war, were, with|out di&s;tinction, brought before the Governor.</P></NOTE>

<P>The people of Penn&s;ylvania, and New-Jer&s;eys, as has been already noted, have had full opportunity to experience the good di&s;po&s;ition and kindne&s;s of the In|dians, &s;o long as they were treated with ju&s;tice and humanity, as particularly ap|pears from the many &s;triking in&s;tances of probity, gratitude and beneficence, on record, at a time when the di&s;parity of their numbers was &s;o great, that they might have ea&s;ily de&s;troyed the &s;ettlers,

<P>The Annals of New-England informs us, that the fir&s;t &s;ettlers met with kind treatment from the Natives, even when they were few, and &s;o &s;ickly, that in the fir&s;t winter, one half of their number died.</P>

<P>_IN an hi&s;torical account of Ge|neral Boquet's expedition again&s;t the Ohio Indians, publi&s;hed under his in&s;pecti|on, in 1765, we meet with a li&s;t of the fighting men of the different Indian na|tions of the northern and &s;outhern di|&s;tricts of North-America, amounting to fifty-&s;ix thou&s;and, five hundred and eigh|ty, con&s;i&s;ting, chiefly, of &s;uch Indians as the French were connected with in Canada and Loui&s;iana.</P>
<P>This account we are there told may be depended upon, &s;o far as matters of this kind can be brought near the truth, be|ing given by a French trader of con&s;ide|rable note, who had re&s;ided many years among&s;t the Indians.</P>

Thus a comparative judgment may be formed of the nations above-mentioned; the number of who&s;e inhabitants will (in this proportion to the warriors, viz. five to one) be about 283000."</P>
<P>From the above account of the num|ber of Indians known to us, be&s;ides tho&s;e we are unacquainted with, how important mu&s;t it appear, to every &s;en&s;ible feeling mind, that a friendly intercour&s;e be main|tained with them as well from our duty as Chri&s;tians, as the great advantage which would ari&s;e from a well regulated trade; and the dreadful di&s;tre&s;s and &s;uf|ferings,
