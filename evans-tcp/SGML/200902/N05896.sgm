Whereupon the Hou&s;e declare it to be their clear Opinion, that the Grant of any Money by this Court to be rai&s;ed by the People, mu&s;t not only originate with the Hou&s;e, in Con&s;equence of their repre&s;enting the People, but that &s;uch Grant cannot, in Con&s;equence of this their &s;ingular Right, be any Way &s;ubject to the Alteration of any other Branch of the Government; and that the Amendment made Ye&s;terday by the Board in the &s;aid Grant, is a Violation of the Priviledge of the Hou&s;e, upon a Vote made for the Support of their Priviledges; which they are determined thoroughly to defend and maintain again&s;t all Attempts and En|croachments what&s;oever.</P>

<P>The Board have no Inclination to engage in a Con|trover&s;y with the honourable Hou&s;e on any Point what&s;oever, at a Juncture when Affairs of &s;uch va&s;t Importance are depending, and although the Board have been in the con&s;tant Practice of le&s;&s;ening Grants made by the honourable Hou&s;e, ever &s;ince the Char|ter, yet they do not de&s;ign to enter into any Di&s;pute on this Point at this Time: Before the Me&s;&s;age from the honourable Hou&s;e of this Day, the Board had ab&s;olutely non-concur'd the Vote of the honourable Hou&s;e, which had fir&s;t been amended by the Board, but upon a Non Concurrence of the honourable Hou&s;e, was again &s;ent up to the Board.</P>
<P>The Board are de&s;irous of keeping up the Har|mony that has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the &s;everal Branches of the Legi&s;lature, and are neither for extending their own Priviledges nor abridging the Priviledges of the honourable Hou&s;e, and are willing to come into any Expedient, that may pre&s;erve the Rights of each Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Board would have no Exception to a Vote, effectually &s;ecuring the Payment out of the publick Trea&s;ury, of every rea&s;onable Expence, that may at|tend or be the Con&s;equence of the Actions referred to: but they apprehend that many Inconveniences may ari&s;e from the granting any determinate large Sum for this Purpo&s;e, and that all the Ends propo&s;ed by the Vote of the honourable Hou&s;e may be fully an&s;wered without it.</P>
