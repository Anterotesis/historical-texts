<P>For, no Man ever yet hated his own Fle&s;h, but nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;heth it.&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_I PRESUME, my <HI>Brethren,</HI> I need not mention the <HI>&s;orrowful Occa&s;ion,</HI> of &s;elect|ing this Portion of Scripture, for the Subject of my Di&s;cour&s;e, this Day:&mdash; An Occa&s;ion quite <HI>new,</HI> as well as very <HI>awful;</HI> &s;uch as, I think, has not occur'd among us, till now, &s;ince I came into this Place:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which is now, almo&s;t the Space of <HI>Fifty-&s;even Years.</HI></NOTE> And I pray God, that we may never &s;ee the like again!</P>
<P>THE Words now read &s;tand in a fair <HI>Connection</HI> with the preceeding, as appears by the <HI>illative</HI> Particle, <HI>For:</HI>&mdash;The Apo&s;tle is here exhorting to the faithful Di&s;charge of relative Duties:&mdash;And particularly, that <HI>Hu&s;bands</HI> and <HI>Wives</HI> be very careful to perform the Duties, which are mutually incumbent each on other. And as to the <HI>Hu&s;band,</HI> the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, ver. 28. <HI>So ought Men to love their Wives, as their own Bodies: He that loveth his Wife, loveth him&s;elf.</HI> Then it follows,
<PB N="6" REF="010740_0004_0F81752703985D48">
as in my <HI>Text; For, no Man ever yet hated his own Fle&s;h, but nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;heth it.</HI> Q. D. In like manner, ought Hu&s;bands to di&s;cover their Love to their Wives, by nouri&s;hing and cheri&s;hing them: For, the Wife being <HI>made One</HI> with her Hu&s;band, <HI>that is,</HI> in a civil and relative &s;en&s;e, therefore he &s;hould love her, with as cordial and unfeigned Affection, as he loveth him&s;elf. And the Apo&s;tle here refers to the Words of <HI>Adam,</HI> when <HI>Eve</HI> was given to him for a meet help. Gen. 2.24. <HI>Therefore &s;hall a Man leave his Father and Mother, and &s;hall cleave unto his Wife, and they &s;hall be one Fle&s;h.</HI> ver. 31. of my Context. By which, "we are not to under&s;tand, that a Man's Ob|ligation to his other Relatives, as Father and Mother in particular, is wholly made void upon his Marriage; but only, that this Relation is to be <HI>prefer'd</HI> to all o|thers; there being a <HI>nearer Union</HI> betwixt the&s;e two, than betwixt any others."</P>
<P>BUT I am not, at this Time, about to di&s;cour&s;e on the re&s;pective Duties of Hu&s;bands and Wives towards each other: But only on the Words <HI>introduc'd</HI> by the Apo&s;tle, as a <HI>Medium,</HI> for the <HI>Illu&s;tration</HI> of his Argu|ment, and which is here laid down as an <HI>inconte&s;table</HI> Propo&s;ition, <HI>viz. That no Man ever yet hated his own Fle&s;h,</HI> &amp;c. Q. D. Whatever &s;how or appearance of this, there may &s;ometimes have been, yet, <HI>no Man ever did,</HI> in Reality, <HI>hate his own Fle&s;h, but nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;heth it.</HI></P>
<P>NO <HI>Man,</HI> i. e. no one con&s;ider'd <HI>as a Man,</HI> or wor|thy the <HI>Name</HI> of a Man, or as an&s;wering to the pro|per <HI>Definition</HI> of a Man, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Man is a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> Creature: Or, as &s;ome choo&s;e to &s;ay, He is a <HI>religious</HI> Creature, having in his <HI>Nature,</HI> &s;ome Sen&s;e, Belief and Dread of the <HI>Deity.</HI>&mdash;Now, <HI>no &s;uch Man,</HI> did ever yet hate his own Fle&s;h, but nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;heth it.</NOTE> <HI>did ever yet hate his own
<PB N="7" REF="010740_0004_0F81752703985D48">
Fle&s;h,</HI> or his own Body; nay, but he is &s;o from hating, that <HI>he nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;heth it;</HI> being very de&s;irous to have the Life of it prolonged &mdash;So that we may make this OBSERVATION from the Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>THAT it is an unque&s;tionable Truth, that <HI>no Man, while in his right Sen&s;es,</HI> and <HI>&s;o long as he retain'd the Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding of a Man,</HI> ever yet hated his own Fle&s;h, but nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;heth it.</P>
<P>I SUPPOSE, I need to &s;ay but little for the Confir|mation of the Doctrine; the <HI>Improvement</HI> of it is what I e&s;pecially intend.&mdash;However, it is proper that &s;ome|thing be offer'd in <HI>Proof</HI> of the Point.&mdash;Wherefore,</P>
<P N="1">1^&s;^t^. THE Truth of the Doctrine appears from the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Self-pre&s;ervation,</HI> which is implanted in the <HI>Nature</HI> of Man, as well as of the Bruits.&mdash;This Law of Nature, implanted <HI>by the God of Nature,</HI> inclines and urges every Man, <HI>while in his right Mind,</HI> to endeavour the lengthening out of his own Life, as al&s;o that he may enjoy the Comforts of Life. Nothing in the World is &s;o near and dear to him as him&s;elf, and his own Life: And this is owing to his <HI>Nature</HI> and Con|&s;titution, and therefore <HI>is tran&s;mitted</HI> from Generation to Generation: So that, it is a Truth, altho' &s;poken by the Father of Lies, and of Lyars (for Lyars &s;ome|times &s;peak the Truth) <HI>viz. Skin for Skin, yea, all that a Man hath, will he give for his Life.</HI> Job 2.4. Men commonly love them&s;elves, more than their neare&s;t Relatives, even, than their own Children, tho' they be pieces of them&s;elves: And moreover, they will not only hazard their E&s;tates, but give them away, to &s;ave their Lives.&mdash;And the true Rea&s;on of this, is, becau&s;e Self-pre&s;ervation is a powerful, commanding <HI>Principle</HI> in the Hearts of Men, &s;o long as they retain their right Sen&s;es. And,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="010740_0005_0F817527C016C808">2^d^l^y^. THE Truth of the Doctrine further appears from our own <HI>Ob&s;ervation</HI> and <HI>Experience:</HI>&mdash;As for <HI>in&s;tance,</HI> how &s;trenuou&s;ly will Men <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> an <HI>Adver&s;ary,</HI> when endeavouring to deprive them of their Lives? They will kill one, yea, many, if po&s;&s;ible, rather than be kill'd them&s;elves: Nor is it uncommon for Men to re|joice and glory in the Slaughter of tho&s;e who &s;eek their Lives.&mdash;And I may add, that when any are <HI>taken Cap|tive</HI> by a barbarous Enemy, they (and al&s;o their Friends) think nothing too much to be given for their Redemp|tion, becau&s;e they are daily in fear of lo&s;ing their Lives.&mdash;And then, as to <HI>the Means</HI> of <HI>&s;upporting</HI> the Body; becau&s;e Men find, that the Body &s;tands in need of Meat, Drink and Cloathing, and cannot, in an or|dinary Way, &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them; therefore they la|bour with all Diligence, and &s;train every Nerve, to procure the &s;ame; in&s;omuch, that &s;ome Men need to be call'd upon to &s;lack their Pace, and to be more moderate in the Pur&s;uit of the&s;e Things: They don't con&s;ider the Danger of exce&s;&s;ive and immoderate La|bour; but u&s;e their Bodies, as tho' their Strength was the Strength of Stones, and as tho' they thought their Fle&s;h was Bra&s;s: Alas! how many, while they labour for the Body, are, by their Imprudence, actually de|&s;troying it; and yet, all the while, they toil <HI>in Love</HI> to the <HI>Body,</HI> and to the Supports and Conveniences of the pre&s;ent Life.&mdash;And furthermore, if a Limb be <HI>broken,</HI> or if the Body be &s;eiz'd with &s;ome <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI> which threatens it's Di&s;&s;olution, then, the <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> or the <HI>Surgeon</HI> is call'd for in great ha&s;te, and no Co&s;t &s;hall be &s;par'd for the obtaining of Relief: And the true Rea&s;on of all this, is, becau&s;e, commonly &s;peaking, nothing is &s;o dreaded by Mankind, as Death; and therefore, <HI>Death</HI> is &s;tiled <HI>the King of Terrors.</HI> Job 18.14. Yea, Death is &s;o terrible to Nature, that many are <HI>all their Life-time, &s;ubject unto Bondage, thro' fear of Death.</HI> Heb.
<PB N="9" REF="010740_0005_0F817527C016C808">
2.15. The very &s;ight of a <HI>Corp's</HI> is ga&s;tly; <HI>Abraham</HI> therefore &s;ought to bury the dead Body of his well-beloved <HI>Sarah out of his Sight.</HI> Gen. 23.4. But when we <HI>feel our own</HI> Souls about to leave the Body, how great Reluctance &s;hall we then find?&mdash;Yea, our Sa|viour him&s;elf, when Death was approaching, pray'd, &s;aying, Mat. 26.39. <HI>O my Father, if it be po&s;&s;ible, let this Cup pa&s;s from me!</HI> For, <HI>as Man,</HI> he cou'd not but be aver&s;e to Suffering and Death: This &s;hows, that He was touch'd with the feeling of our Infirmities, and that He was tempted as we are, <HI>yet without Sin;</HI> for, He refer'd him&s;elf intirely <HI>to his Father's Will.</HI>&mdash;In &s;hort, &s;o &s;trict is the Union between Soul and Body, that whatever affects the Body, affects the Soul al&s;o: For, the Body is not only the Soul's intimate Friend, but even it's Hou&s;e and Habitation; as al&s;o it's In|&s;trument, by which it doth it's Bu&s;ine&s;s in the World, both natural and religious.</P>
<P>BUT probably, &s;ome will <HI>object</HI> and &s;ay, there are &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of <HI>Scripture,</HI> which &s;eem to <HI>contradict</HI> what has been now advanced.&mdash;As for <HI>in&s;tance; Job</HI> &s;aid, Chap. 10.1. <HI>My Soul is weary of my Life</HI> &mdash;To which I <HI>reply,</HI> that this was owing to <HI>a fit of Impatience:</HI> And yet it &s;hould be remark'd, that he did not intend, that he was weary of his Life <HI>&s;imply con&s;ider'd;</HI> but only, that he was weary of &s;uch a Life of Pain and Trouble: So that, tho' he was weary of his Affliction, yet &s;trictly &s;peaking, not of his Life.&mdash;Again, it is al&s;o written in Prov. 8. ult. <HI>All they that hate me, love Death.</HI>&mdash;I <HI>an&s;wer,</HI> the meaning of this is, that they love Death <HI>in it's Cau&s;es,</HI> i. e. they love that which will <HI>end</HI> in Death, and put that away from them which would <HI>end</HI> in Life.&mdash;Again, it is &s;aid in Heb. 11.35. <HI>Some were tortur'd, not accepting Deliverance:</HI> And in like man|ner, we read in Rev. 12.11. <HI>They loved not their Lives unto the Death.</HI>&mdash;I <HI>reply,</HI> this intends, that they would
<PB N="10" REF="010740_0006_0F8175287B159858">
not accept Deliverance <HI>on the Terms propo&s;ed, viz.</HI> to renounce the true Religion, and embrace a fal&s;e one: Their Love to their own Lives was <HI>overcome</HI> by a &s;tronger Affection to Chri&s;t, in&s;omuch, that <HI>in his Cau&s;e,</HI> they could freely lay them down: And agrea|bly, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid, Acts 20.24. <HI>I count not my Life dear to my &s;elf, &s;o that I may fini&s;h my Cour&s;e with Joy.</HI> He was willing, not only to &s;pend his Life in Labour, but al&s;o to lay it down in <HI>Martyrdom:</HI> And of the &s;ame mind were all the other holy <HI>Martyrs;</HI> for, tho' Life was &s;weet to them, yet they were deter|min'd to die for Chri&s;t, rather than to deny him, and actually did &s;o; and therein comply'd with the Term of Di&s;ciple&s;hip, laid down by Chri&s;t, in Luk. 14.26.&mdash; So that the Law of Self-pre&s;ervation did bear <HI>Rule</HI> in them, until it was <HI>over-rul'd</HI> by another and higher Law.</P>
<P>IF it be further &s;aid by way of <HI>Objection,</HI> that &s;ome Per&s;ons <HI>make an higher account</HI> of their <HI>Honour,</HI> than of their own <HI>Lives;</HI> namely, &s;uch Men who agree to decide their Controver&s;y <HI>by way of Duel.</HI>&mdash;I <HI>reply</HI> briefly, that both he who makes, and he that accepts the Challenge, are <HI>infatuated:</HI> So far from being in the <HI>regular</HI> Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on, that their unbridled Ap|petites and Pa&s;&s;ions have the <HI>Empire</HI> over Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience.&mdash;But then I &s;hall add, that notwith&s;tand|ing <HI>Madne&s;s is in their Hearts,</HI> yet their <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> is in no mea&s;ure dimini&s;hed; for, doubtle&s;s, each one nouri&s;heth in him&s;elf a fond De&s;ire and <HI>Hope,</HI> that he &s;hall vanqui&s;h and <HI>&s;urvive</HI> his Antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>ONCE more, it may perhaps &s;eem very <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent,</HI> that <HI>Self-pre&s;ervation</HI> &s;hould be <HI>a Principle in Nature,</HI> and yet &s;ome Per&s;ons actually de&s;troy their own Lives, <HI>for fear only</HI> of being <HI>reduced</HI> to <HI>Penury.</HI>&mdash;I <HI>reply,</HI> that all tho&s;e Per&s;ons (if there have been any &s;uch) were <HI>too thoughtful</HI> for the Body, and the Life that now is; and the <HI>continued</HI> Thoughtfulne&s;s and Anxiety of their
<PB N="11" REF="010740_0006_0F8175287B159858">
Minds, ari&s;ing partly from bodily Infirmities, and part|ly from Lo&s;&s;es and Di&s;appointments, was &s;o very great and <HI>perplexing,</HI> as <HI>in Conjunction</HI> with the Sugge&s;tions of the bu&s;y Adver&s;ary, to <HI>over-balance</HI> the &s;aid Law of Self-pre&s;ervation, and even all their intellectual Pow|ers; and then, if God permits, they are led captive by that malicious Enemy of their's, at his Will: And thus, <HI>the Sorrow of the World worketh Death.</HI> 2 Cor. 7.10.&mdash;But I ha&s;ten to that which I chiefly intend, <HI>viz.</HI> the</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, We may here &s;ee the <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> and the <HI>Kind|ne&s;s</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> in <HI>putting</HI> a <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>Self-pre&s;ervation,</HI> in the <HI>Nature</HI> of Man.&mdash;This, certainly, ought to be ac|knowledged with all <HI>Thankfulne&s;s;</HI> for, if Men were carele&s;s of their own Lives, they would be void of any Motive to regular Actions: But now, they have <HI>with|in them&s;elves</HI> a con&s;tant <HI>Spur</HI> to Diligence in &s;ome law|ful Calling, that &s;o, the <HI>beloved Body</HI> may be &s;upported, and be continued in a Capacity for Service: And thus, not only Individuals, but the Common-wealth is up|held and pre&s;erved in due Order: Whereas, without this Principle in Man's Nature, all things would quick|ly go into Confu&s;ion.&mdash;True indeed, this Law of Na|ture, by rea&s;on of Corruption within, and of Tempta|tions from without, is often <HI>exceedingly perverted</HI> (and the like may be &s;aid of every other Talent) for alas! how irregular and &s;inful is <HI>Self-love</HI> in the mo&s;t of Men! For, <HI>&s;elf,</HI> yea, <HI>carnal &s;elf</HI> is their <HI>Idol:</HI> They love to gratifie their own Lu&s;ts; and are Lovers of Plea&s;ures, more than Lovers either of God or Man: They make Provi&s;ion for the Fle&s;h, <HI>that &s;o,</HI> they may fulfil the Lu&s;ts thereof: And this brings in a long Train of Sins and Mi&s;chiefs; as may be learn'd from 2 Tim. 3. begin.&mdash;And yet, if Man was <HI>wholly de&s;ti|tute</HI> of the principle of Self-love, and Self-pre&s;ervation,
<PB N="12" REF="010740_0007_0F817529360C0388">
this World would be in reality, no better than a larger <HI>Bedlam.</HI>&mdash;In a Word, it highly concerns us all to beg of God, that He would be plea&s;ed, to turn <HI>Self-love</HI> into a <HI>right Channel:</HI> That is, that He would, by his Grace, di&s;po&s;e and enable us to have and maintain a due Regard to our own <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> as well as temporal Weal: And that, for this End, "He would put his Fear in our Hearts; or, that we may be his Work|man&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, unto good Works."</P>
<P>SECONDLY, From what has been &s;aid, we al&s;o learn, that it becomes <HI>each of us</HI> to be very <HI>thankful</HI> to God, for his <HI>continuing</HI> to us, <HI>our Rea&s;on</HI> and Under&s;tanding, and &s;o, a <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of our own Pre&s;ervation in Life.&mdash; This is wholly owing to the divine Goodne&s;s: And a very great Favour it is; for, what Plea&s;ure could we take in Life, if we were become indifferent, whether we enjoy it, or not? But it would be &s;till much more &s;ad, if Life was become a Burden to us &mdash;<HI>Job</HI> acknow|ledged, not only, that God had granted him Life; but moreover, that by the divine Vi&s;itation, <HI>his Spirit was pre&s;erved.</HI> Chap. 10.12. That is, God not only pre|&s;erved his bodily Life, but al&s;o <HI>continued</HI> to him his Powers of <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> For, God is the <HI>Father of our Spirits;</HI> and as He has endued us with intellectual Faculties, &s;o we are indebted to Him, for <HI>Power</HI> to exerci&s;e and improve the &s;ame. And agreeably, when the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, in Acts 17.28. <HI>In Him we live and move.</HI>&mdash;His meaning is, all our <HI>Springs</HI> of Motion and Action, both as we are <HI>living</HI> Creatures, and as we are <HI>moral</HI> Agents, are from God: And indeed, the regular Motion of the Mind depends, under God, very much on the good Con&s;titution and <HI>Health</HI> of the <HI>Body;</HI> and therefore, the Di&s;order of the Mind, when it be|comes <HI>habitual,</HI> is commonly owing to &s;ome Indi&s;po|&s;ition of Body: So then, when we acknowledge God, as the Health of our Countenances, we may not omit
<PB N="13" REF="010740_0007_0F817529360C0388">
to prai&s;e Him al&s;o, for the Order and Vigour of our Minds.&mdash;You are &s;en&s;ible, <HI>my Hearers,</HI> that many Per|&s;ons, of each Sex, have, in hope of finding Relief, been bro't from other Towns, <HI>into this Pari&s;h,</HI> who were <HI>di&s;order'd</HI> in their Intellectuals.&mdash; Which I now men|tion, <HI>to excite us</HI> unto <HI>Thankfulne&s;s,</HI> for the Enjoyment of <HI>our own</HI> Under&s;tanding; for, what more lamenta|ble Objects than tho&s;e above-mentioned, can be pre|&s;ented <HI>before us?</HI> Surely, the <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> of our <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> is to be dreaded and deprecated, much more than Poverty, or Pain, or any other bodily Calamity: Becau&s;e, if <HI>this</HI> &s;hould be our unhappy Ca&s;e, we &s;hall then become a Burden, if not a Terror, both to our&s;elves and others; and con&s;equently unfit for the Service both of God and Man.&mdash;You remember the Story of King <HI>Nebuc|hadnezzar,</HI> how he was puni&s;hed for his Pride and Haughtine&s;s: Deprived, not only of his Honour as a King, but even as a Man al&s;o; for he became a Brute in the Shape of a Man: <HI>A Bea&s;t's Heart was given to him,</HI> i. e. the Inclination and Appetite of a Bea&s;t; and accordingly, <HI>his Dwelling was with the Bea&s;ts of the Field, and he fed on Gra&s;s as the Oxen.</HI> See Dan. 4th Chap.&mdash;And it is <HI>alike ea&s;y</HI> for the mo&s;t High, to de|prive any, yea, <HI>all of us,</HI> of this invaluable Talent, <HI>viz.</HI> the Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding of Men, and to rank <HI>us al&s;o</HI> among the Bea&s;ts of the Field.&mdash;And O, that <HI>we may not abu&s;e our Rea&s;on,</HI> to the Indulgence of <HI>Pride,</HI> or of any <HI>other Lu&s;t,</HI> le&s;t God be provoked to deprive us of it!

<P>THIRDLY, We may further infer from what has been &s;aid, that commonly &s;peaking, &s;uch Per&s;ons who <HI>offer Violence to their own Lives, have not at that time, the due Exerci&s;e of their Rea&s;on.</HI>&mdash;They are de&s;titute of natural Affection; have lo&s;t, not only, that Love which they once had to their Relatives and other Friends, but even <HI>to them&s;elves</HI> al&s;o: And in this re|&s;pect, they degrade them&s;elves, even below the Rank of the <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> that peri&s;h: For, it is <HI>natural</HI> to <HI>the&s;e,</HI> in their &s;everal Kinds, to protect both them&s;elves and their Young, as much as lays in their Power.</P>

<PB N="17" REF="010740_0009_0F81752AECB0C3F0">
horrible in the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> Degree; the mo&s;t barbarous and inhuman of all bodily Murders.</P>
<P>BUT that we may clearly di&s;cern the <HI>horrid Evil</HI> of this Sin, I &s;hall offer a few things to Con&s;ideration, from tho&s;e Topicks, which are commonly made u&s;e of.&mdash; Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1^&s;^t^. 'TIS a Sin "directly <HI>contrary</HI> to the Law of <HI>Self-pre&s;ervation;</HI>" which, as I &s;aid before, is the Law of God: For, <HI>God put into Man,</HI> in his <HI>original</HI> Con|&s;titution, an Inclination to love Life, and a De&s;ire to pre&s;erve it; and therefore it is unnatural, and con&s;e|quently &s;inful, for any to go about to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P N="2">2^d^l^y^. 'TIS al&s;o repugnant to the <HI>written</HI> and revealed Will of God; the <HI>&s;ixth</HI> Commandment in the moral Law, you know, is, <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill.</HI> And this, as <HI>our Catechi&s;m</HI> well expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>forbids the taking away of our own Life, or the Life of our Neighbour unju&s;tly, or what&s;oever tendeth thereunto.</HI> Now, here, the glorious Law-giver, who has &s;trictly forbidden the taking a|way the Life of our Neighbour <HI>unju&s;tly;</HI> has al&s;o for|bidden, <HI>on any Con&s;ideration whatever,</HI> the taking away of <HI>our own Life:</HI> For, tho' we are commanded to love our Neighbour <HI>as our&s;elves,</HI> yet <HI>not more</HI> than our&s;elves: And therefore, if we may not kill him, then &s;urely, we may not kill our&s;elves. And further,</P>
<P N="3">3^d^l^y^. 'TIS not only a practical Rebellion again&s;t the Commandment, "but moreover again&s;t the <HI>Govern|ment</HI> of God." 'Tis a taking of his Work into our own Hands; when, we are not our own, but <HI>His;</HI> and ought to be willing to be at his Di&s;po&s;al in the World, and not go about to di&s;po&s;e of our Lives at our own Plea&s;ure.&mdash;It is worthy to be remembered, that the mo&s;t High <HI>retains his Propriety</HI> in his Crea|tures; <HI>all Souls,</HI> &s;ays He, <HI>are mine.</HI> Ezek. 18.4. <HI>The Earth is the Lord's and the Fulne&s;s thereof; the World
<PB N="18" REF="010740_0010_0F81752BB1B69FA0">
and they that dwell therein.</HI> P&s;al. 24.1 &mdash;In &s;hort, He that <HI>made</HI> us, is mo&s;t <HI>rightfully</HI> the Lord of our Lives; and it is mo&s;t fit that our Times &s;hould be in His Hands, and not in our own: How dare any then, to <HI>a&s;&s;ume</HI> to them&s;elves <HI>his Prerogative,</HI> &s;o as to cut off their own Lives? Surely, &s;o to do, is no le&s;s than a de&s;pi&s;ing of his Authority and Dominion; and practi|cally to &s;ay, we are our own Lords, and will not be controul'd, no, not by God Him&s;elf; which is the very Spirit and Language of the <HI>Devil</HI> and his Angels.</P>
<P N="4">4^t^h^l^y^. THIS Sin carries in it, not only undutifulne&s;s to God, and a trampling on his Authority and Govern|ment; "but moreover, <HI>the blacke&s;t Ingratitude:</HI>"&mdash; 'Tis a vile <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> of <HI>God</HI> towards Man: For, Life is certainly a great Favour, &s;uch as we ought to be very thankful for, unto Him, who vouch&s;afes the &s;ame unto us, who is no other but the mo&s;t High; and therefore, one of his Titles is, that He is <HI>the Pre&s;erver of Men:</HI>&mdash;Nor indeed, may any worldly Enjoyment be prefer'd before it. Tho' <HI>the loving Kindne&s;s of God is better than Life,</HI> even in it's be&s;t E&s;tate; yet no earthly Accommodations may be compared with it: <HI>All that a Man hath will he give for his Life:</HI> Now, <HI>the greater</HI> any <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> is, the <HI>more heinous</HI> is their <HI>Sin,</HI> who ca&s;t <HI>Contempt</HI> upon it: And this is what <HI>they</HI> are mo&s;t flagrantly guilty of, who offer Violence to their own Lives.&mdash;Moreover,</P>
<P N="5">5^t^h^l^y^. THE Heinou&s;ne&s;s of this Sin appears, in that it implies in it, "the greate&s;t <HI>Di&s;re&s;pect</HI> and <HI>Unkindne&s;s</HI> towards our <HI>Relatives,</HI> and even to the <HI>whole Commu|nity,</HI> or Society, unto which we belong."&mdash;No man is born for him&s;elf alone, but al&s;o for the Benefit of the Family, and of the Community, of which he is a Mem|ber; and unto which he is, or ought to be, in &s;ome Degree &s;erviceable.&mdash;But now, by de&s;troying his own Life, he wholly deprives both the Family and Common|wealth
<PB N="19" REF="010740_0010_0F81752BB1B69FA0">
of that Benefit.&mdash;And I may add, that becau&s;e hereby an Injury is offer'd to human Society, and a Contempt ca&s;t on the Law, both of God and Man, therefore civil Governments, in chri&s;tian Countries, <HI>di&s;allow a decent Burial unto &s;uch:</HI> And that, not only as a public Te&s;timony of their Re&s;entment of the Crime, but moreover, as <HI>a Warning</HI> to Survivors, that no other may, in like manner, offend.</P>
<P N="6">6^t^h^l^y^. THIS Sin further appears to be very heinous, in that, &s;uch who become guilty of it, "render them|&s;elves wholly <HI>uncapable</HI> of advancing the declarative <HI>Glory of God</HI> in the World; and con&s;equently <HI>deprive them&s;elves</HI> of the <HI>Opportunity to be laying up their Trea|&s;ure in Heaven.</HI>&mdash;Together with the Day of Life, they put an End al&s;o to the Day of Grace; for, <HI>there is no Work nor Device, Wi&s;dom or Knowledge in the Grave.</HI>&mdash; What do we live for, but to &s;erve and honour our Lord and Ma&s;ter here in the World; and in &s;o doing, pre|pare for his Coming? What Madne&s;s is it then, for any, with their own Hands, <HI>to put an End to the &s;pace,</HI> which God is giving them wherein to repent, and to work out their own Salvation:&mdash;We, who hear the Go&s;pel-call &amp; Invitation, are di&s;tingui&s;hingly favour'd, and as our Saviour expre&s;&s;es it, are <HI>exalted to Heaven:</HI> And what, &s;hall any &s;uch make &s;o light of <HI>this</HI> their Privilege, as to exclude them&s;elves <HI>from the Sanctuary of God,</HI> and no more hear the joyful Sound, <HI>viz.</HI> by putting a final Period to their own Lives? O, how ungrateful are they to their be&s;t Friend and Bene|factor, and how unkind and even barbarous to them|&s;elves! Without Fear, and as void of Wit. Again,</P>
<P N="7">7^t^h^l^y^. THE heinous Nature of this Sin may be fur|ther argued from the Con&s;ideration, that it is, in the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> Degree, <HI>gratifying unto Satan.</HI>&mdash;He is call'd <HI>the Evil one,</HI> and the <HI>Devil,</HI> becau&s;e he takes Delight in

<HI>rebelling</HI> again&s;t God; and in <HI>&s;oliciting</HI> the Children of Men &s;o to do. Being abandoned by God, for his fir&s;t act of Rebellion, he became an avowed Enemy unto God, and to all that is good.&mdash;And now, &s;eeing he de|lights <HI>only</HI> in <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;chief,</HI> we may fairly infer, that it is mo&s;t highly plea&s;ing to him, when he can prevail with any Per&s;on, to de&s;troy his own Life; for, <HI>this</HI> fatal Act is <HI>big</HI> with <HI>both</HI> the&s;e kinds of Evil: And ac|cordingly, he is &s;aid to be, not only a Lyar, but a <HI>Mur|derer from the Beginning:</HI> Not only <HI>at the Beginning,</HI> by tempting our fir&s;t Parents to eat the forbidden Fruit; and truly <HI>that</HI> very Sin bro't Death into the World; for, <HI>by one Man, Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all:</HI> And therefore <HI>Satan</HI> was, in effect, the Murderer of all Mankind.&mdash; But moreover, he is a Murderer <HI>from the Beginning,</HI> i. e. as he was, &s;o <HI>he continues</HI> to be the Murderer of Man|kind: Altho' he knows, that all the Children of Men are under the <HI>Sentence</HI> of Death, yet, is not content therewith; and therefore &s;eeks to <HI>ha&s;ten on</HI> the Di&s;&s;o|lution of one and another, and if po&s;&s;ible, by the mo&s;t <HI>unnatural</HI> Means; hoping thereby, to de&s;troy both Body and Soul, at one Blow: And agreeably, he is &s;tiled our <HI>Adver&s;ary,</HI> and is &s;aid <HI>to walk about, &s;eeking whom he may devour:</HI> And in this re&s;pect, he is com|par'd to <HI>roaring Lion,</HI> hungry, &s;trong and cruel. 1 Pet. 5.8. His whole De&s;ign is to prey upon, and <HI>devour</HI> the Children of Men; and is therefore <HI>re&s;tle&s;s</HI> in his malicious Endeavours.&mdash;Now, I &s;ay, &s;eeing this a|po&s;tate Spirit, this fir&s;t Rebel, is <HI>mo&s;t highly gratify'd,</HI> when he can prevail with any Per&s;on, to de&s;troy his own Life; we may from thence conclude, that the Sin is very heinous: For, the <HI>greater</HI> the <HI>Sin</HI> is, <HI>the more</HI> is <HI>he delighted</HI> at the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> of it.&mdash;Once more,</P>
<P N="8">8^t^h^l^y^. THIS Sin further appears to be highly aggra|vated, in that they who are guilty of it, "expo&s;e them|&s;elves

And a|greeably, we read in 1 Joh. 3.15. <HI>Ye know, that no Murderer hath eternal Life abiding in him.</HI> That is, a Murderer has not <HI>the Principle</HI> of eternal Life abiding in him.&mdash;And &s;eeing this is the Ca&s;e of him, who, <HI>in his Heart,</HI> de&s;troys his Brother, what Rea&s;on has the Man who de&s;ignedly and actually de&s;troys his own Life, to imagine, that he has a <HI>living</HI> or an holy Prin|ciple within him&s;elf? For &s;urely, he ought to &s;et as high a Value on his own Life, as on the Life of his Brother: For, altho' we are commanded to love our Neighbour as our&s;elves, yet, not more than our&s;elves, as was before ob&s;erved.</P>

SOME, it &s;eems, plead, "that there are <HI>Exam|ples</HI> upon Record, <HI>in the holy Scriptures,</HI> of &s;everal Per|&s;ons, who de&s;troyed their own Lives," namely, King <HI>Saul,</HI> who fell on his own Sword: And <HI>Zimri,</HI> who &s;eeing him&s;elf in eminent Hazard of being taken, and put to Death by <HI>Omri,</HI> he went into the Palace of the King's hou&s;e, and burnt the King's hou&s;e over him with fire, &amp; died. 1 Kin. 16.18.&mdash;And <HI>Ahithophel,</HI> who hang'd him&s;elf.&mdash;And <HI>Judas,</HI> who having <HI>&s;trangled him&s;elf,</HI> he <HI>fell headlong, and all his Bowels gu&s;hed out.</HI> Acts 1.18.</P>
<P>TO this I <HI>reply;</HI> we may not imagine, that the&s;e Examples are left on Record <HI>in the Scriptures,</HI> for our Di|rection, or that we may imitate them: Nay, but <HI>for a Warning</HI> to all who &s;hall read them, that we may not run into their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, or any other like them, and &s;o peri&s;h, as they did.&mdash;Examples are to be followed &s;o far as they are good, but no further: For, we ought to be govern'd by the <HI>Precepts</HI> of God's Word, and not by the Examples therein recorded; but only
<PB N="24" REF="010740_0013_0F81752F3424B588">
when tho&s;e Examples <HI>quadrate</HI> with the Precepts.&mdash; And it &s;eems the more &s;trange, that any &s;hould <HI>plead the&s;e</HI> Examples, as tho' they were worthy of Imitation, &s;eeing they were all of them, <HI>ungodly</HI> Men; as ap|pears from the Character given of them, <HI>in the Scrip|tures.</HI>&mdash;Nor do I remember, that we have an account <HI>in Scripture,</HI> of more than <HI>One,</HI> who may come under the Denomination of a <HI>good Man,</HI> that can be &s;aid to put an end to his Life, namely, <HI>Samp&s;on.</HI>&mdash;But then, as to him, it may be &s;aid, (1.) That his next or <HI>immedi|ate</HI> De&s;ign was <HI>not</HI> to de&s;troy him&s;elf, but his inveterate Enemies: And as he was a public Per&s;on, being <HI>Judge</HI> in I&s;rael, he had a ju&s;t <HI>Right</HI> to endeavour the De|&s;truction of his own, and the People's Oppre&s;&s;ors: But this, <HI>having lo&s;t his Eyes,</HI> he had no Pro&s;pect of effecting, unle&s;s he was willing to &s;hare with them, and to lo&s;e his own Life in the Overthrow; and therefore, <HI>Heroe,</HI> or <HI>Martyr</HI>-like, rather than let &s;lip &s;o fair an Opportunity, to te&s;tifie his Loyalty to the Mo&s;t High, and Love to his Country, he readily <HI>re&s;igned</HI> his Life, and his All, <HI>to the Will of God.</HI> And accordingly (2.) He <HI>pray'd,</HI> that God would not only remember him, and &s;trengthen him to do Execution on his Enemies; but moreover, that he <HI>might die with them;</HI> i. e. he de|&s;ired, <HI>with Submi&s;&s;ion to the Will of God,</HI> that he might, at that <HI>Time,</HI> and in that <HI>Manner,</HI> fini&s;h his Cour&s;e. And (3.) <HI>God fulfilled</HI> his Reque&s;t; for, it was a Prayer of <HI>Faith,</HI> and of an ardent <HI>Zeal</HI> for the Glory of God, and the Deliverance of his People: As <HI>God had put in his Heart,</HI> to undertake the pulling down of the Hou&s;e, &s;o likewi&s;e <HI>di&s;po&s;ed</HI> him freely to re&s;ign his own Life, and to <HI>pray</HI> as afore&s;aid.&mdash;It appears evident to me, that for the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah's</HI> &s;ake, God pardon'd <HI>Samp&s;on's</HI> amo|rous Follies, and all his other Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and re|ceived him into his Favour: And <HI>in Token</HI> thereof, He gave a gracious <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to <HI>each</HI> of his Petitions.&mdash;

Once more (4.)

<P>I REPLY; that our Saviour's De&s;ign, in tho&s;e Words, is only to teach us, that He was perfectly free and <HI>vo|luntary</HI> in his Sufferings and Death: And truly, if He had not been &s;o, his offering would have been of no Value.
