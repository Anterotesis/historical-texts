<P><Q>WHEN we con&s;ider of how great Con&s;equence the Friend|&s;hip and Alliance of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> is, to all His Maje&s;ty's Colonies and Plantations in <HI>America</HI> in general, as well as to <HI>New-York</HI> in particular: When we con&s;ider, that this Friend&s;hip and Alliance is only to be gained and pre&s;erved by making Pre|&s;ents to them at proper Times, and upon proper Occa&s;ions; and by an inviolable Ob&s;ervance of all our Engagements with them: And when we recollect the Attempts which have been lately made, to withdraw them from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, we cannot but be greatly concerned and &s;urprized, that the Province of <HI>New-York</HI> &s;hould have been &s;o inattentive to the general Intere&s;t of His Maje&s;ty's Subjects in <HI>America,</HI> as well as to their own par|ticular Security, as to have given Occa&s;ion to the Complaints made by the <HI>Indians;</HI> but we are &s;till more &s;urprized, at the Manner in which the&s;e Complaints were received, the di&s;&s;atis|factory An&s;wers given to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and at their being &s;uffered to depart (tho' the A&s;&s;embly was then &s;itting) without any Mea&s;ures taken to bring them to Temper, or to redre&s;s their Complaints. &mdash; 'And this leads us to recommend one Thing more to your Attention, and that is, to take Care, that all the Provinces be (if practicable) compri&s;ed in one General Treaty, to be made in His Maje&s;ty's Name; it appearing to us, that the Practice of each Province making a &s;eparate Treaty for it&s;elf, in its own Name, is very improper, and may be attended with great Inconveniency to His Maje&s;ty's Subjects.</Q></P>

<P>THAT His Maje&s;ty's Title to the Northern Continent of <HI>America,</HI> appears to be &s;ounded on the Di&s;covery thereof fir&s;t made, and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof fir&s;t taken in 1497, under a Commi&s;&s;ion from <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth of <HI>England,</HI> to <HI>Seba&s;tian Cabot.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="5" REF="007433_0005_102D860189646F28">
That all the Lands or Countries We&s;tward from the <HI>Atlantic Ocean</HI> to the <HI>South Sea,</HI> between 48 and 34 Degrees of North Latitude, were expre&s;sly included in the Grant of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, to divers of his Subjects, &s;o long &s;ince, as the Year 1606, and afterwards confirmed in 1620; and under this Grant, the Colony of <HI>Virginia</HI> claims an Extent as far We&s;t as to the <HI>South Sea;</HI> and the antient Colonies of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> and <HI>Con|necticut,</HI> were by their re&s;pective Charters, made to extend to the &s;aid <HI>South Sea;</HI> &s;o that not only the Right to the Sea Coa&s;t, but to all the Inland Countries, from Sea to Sea, have at all Times been a&s;&s;erted by the Crown of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>That the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> or <HI>Accadia,</HI> hath known and determinate Bounds, by the original Grant from King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t; and that there is abundant Evidence of the &s;ame, and of the Knowledge which the <HI>French</HI> had of the&s;e Bounds, while they were in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and that the&s;e Bounds being thus known, the &s;aid Province by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> according to its antient Limits, was ceded to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and remained in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, until the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> by which it was confirmed; but by &s;aid Treaty it is &s;tipulated, That the Bounds of the &s;aid Province &s;hall be determined by Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> the Country of the <HI>Five Cantons</HI> of the <HI>Iroquoi&s;e,</HI> is expre&s;sly acknowledged to be under the Do|minion of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>That the Lake <HI>Champlain,</HI> formerly called Lake <HI>Iroquoi&s;e,</HI> and the Country Southward of it, as far as the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Set|tlements, the Lake <HI>Ontario, Erie,</HI> and all the Countries adjacent, have by all antient Authors, <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> been allowed to belong to the <HI>Five Cantons</HI> or <HI>Nations;</HI> and the whole of tho&s;e Countries, long before the &s;aid Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> were by the &s;aid <HI>Nations,</HI> put under the Protection of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>That by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> there is a Re&s;erve to the <HI>French,</HI> a Liberty of frequenting the Countries of the <HI>Five Na|tions,</HI> and other <HI>Indians</HI> in Friend&s;hip with <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for the Sake of Commerce; as there is al&s;o to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a Liberty of frequenting the Countries of tho&s;e in Friend&s;hip with <HI>France,</HI> for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>That after the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> built &s;everal Fortre&s;&s;es in the Country of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and a very &s;trong one at a Place called <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> to the South of the Lake <HI>Champlain.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>French</HI> Court have evidently, &s;ince the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> made this Northern Continent more than ever, the Object of its Attention.</P>
<P>That the <HI>French</HI> have mo&s;t unju&s;tly taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Part of the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia;</HI> and in the River St. <HI>John's,</HI> and other Parts of &s;aid Province, they have built &s;trong For|tre&s;&s;es; and from this River they will have, during the Winter
<PB N="6" REF="007433_0006_102D71D9DA9FA0C8">and Spring Sea&s;on, a much ea&s;ier Communication between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> than they have heretofore had, and will be furni&s;hed with a Harbour more commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated for the Annoying the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies by Privateers and Men of War, than <HI>Louis|bourg</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>That they have taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and begun a Settlement at the Head of the River <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> within the Bounds of the Province of <HI>Main,</HI> the mo&s;t convenient Situation for affording Support, and a &s;afe Retreat, to the <HI>Ea&s;tern Indians,</HI> in any of their Attempts upon the Governments of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>That is appears by the Information of the Natives, the <HI>French</HI> have been making Preparations for another Settlement, at a Place called <HI>Coba&s;s,</HI> on <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, near the Head thereof, where 'tis but about ten Miles di&s;tant from a Branch of <HI>Merri|mack</HI> River; and from whence, there is a very near and ea&s;y Communication with the <HI>Abnekais Indians,</HI> who are &s;ettled on the River St. <HI>Francois,</HI> about forty Miles from the River St. <HI>Law|rence;</HI> and it is certain, the Inhabitants of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> in which Province this <HI>Coha&s;s</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to lie, have been inter|rupted and impeded by the <HI>French Indians,</HI> from making any Settlement there.</P>
<P>That &s;ince the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> have in|crea&s;ed the Number of their Forts in the Country of the great Lakes, and on the Rivers which run into the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> and are &s;ecuring a Communication between the two Colonies of <HI>Loui&s;iana</HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> and at the &s;ame Time, putting them&s;elves into a Capacity of annoying the Southern <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies, and pre|venting any further Settlements of His Maje&s;ty's Dominions.</P>
<P>That they have been gradually increa&s;ing their Troops in <HI>America,</HI> tran&s;porting them in their Ships of War, which return to <HI>France</HI> with a bare Complement of Men, leaving the re&s;t in their Colonies; and by this Means, they are le&s;s ob&s;erved by the Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> than they would be, if Tran&s;ports as u&s;ual heretofore, were provided for this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>That they have taken Pri&s;oners diver&s;e of His Maje&s;ty's Sub|jects, trading in the Country of the <HI>Iroquoi&s;e,</HI> and other inland Parts, and plundered &s;uch Pri&s;oners of &s;everal Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling; and they are continually exciting the <HI>Indians</HI> to de&s;troy or make Pri&s;oners the Inhabitants of the Frontiers of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies; which Pri&s;oners are carried to <HI>Canada,</HI> and a Price equal to what Slaves are &s;old in the Plantations, is demanded for their Redemption and Relea&s;e.</P>
<P>That they are continually drawing off the <HI>Indians</HI> from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, and have lately per&s;waded one Half of the <HI>Onon|dago</HI> Tribe, with many from the other Nations along with them, to remove to a Place called <HI>O&s;wegachie,</HI> on the River <HI>Cadaracqui,</HI> where they have built them a Church and Fort; and many of the <HI>Senecas,</HI> the mo&s;t numerous Nation, appear to be wavering, and rather inclined to the <HI>French.</HI> And it is a melancholy Con&s;i|deration, that not more than 150 Men of all the &s;everal Nations,
<PB N="7" REF="007433_0007_102D86039A3B35C0">have attended this Treaty, altho' they had Notice, that all the Governments would be here by their Commi&s;&s;ioners, and that a large Pre&s;ent would be given.</P>
<P>That it is the evident De&s;ign of the <HI>French</HI> to &s;urround the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies, to fortify them&s;elves on the Back thereof, to take and keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Heads of all the important Rivers, to draw over the <HI>Indians</HI> to their Intere&s;t, and with the Help of &s;uch <HI>Indians,</HI> added to &s;uch Forces as are already arrived, and may be hereafter &s;ent from <HI>Europe,</HI> to be in a Capacity of making a general Attack upon the &s;everal Governments; and if at the &s;ame Time, a &s;trong Naval Force be &s;ent from <HI>France,</HI> there is the utmo&s;t Danger, that the whole Continent will be &s;ubjected to that Crown: And that the Danger of &s;uch a Naval Force is not meerly imaginary, may be argued from pa&s;t Experience. For had it not been by the mo&s;t extraordinary Interpo&s;ition of Heaven, every Sea Port Town on the Continent, in the Year 1746, might have been ravaged and de&s;troyed, by the Squadron under the Command of the Duke <HI>D'Anville,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the then de|clining State of the <HI>French,</HI> and the very flouri&s;hing State of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Navy, and the further Advantage accruing to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> from the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Cape-Breton.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>French</HI> find by Experience, they are able to make greater and more &s;ecure Advantages upon their Neighbours, in Peace than in War. What they unju&s;tly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of, after the Peace of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> they now pretend they have a Right to hold, by Virtue of the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> until the true Boundary between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> be &s;ettled by Com|mi&s;&s;ioners; but their Conque&s;ts made during War, they have been obliged to re&s;tore.</P>
<P>That the <HI>French</HI> Affairs relative to this Continent, are under one Direction, and con&s;tantly regarded by the Crown and Mini|&s;try, who are not in&s;en&s;ible how great a Stride they would make towards an Univer&s;al Monarchy, if the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies were added to their Dominions, and con&s;equently the whole Trade of <HI>North-America</HI> engro&s;&s;ed by them.</P>
<P>That the &s;aid Colonies being in a divided, di&s;united State, there has never been any joint Exertion of their Force, or Coun|cil, to repel or defeat the Mea&s;ures of the <HI>French;</HI> and particular Colonies are unable and unwilling to maintain the Cau&s;e of the whole.</P>
<P>That there has been a very great Neglect of the Affairs of the <HI>Iroquoi&s;e,</HI> as they are commonly called, <HI>the Indians of the Six Nations,</HI> and their Friend&s;hip and Alliance has been improved to private Purpo&s;es, for the Sake of the Trade with them, and the Purcha&s;e or Acqui&s;ition of their Lands, more than the Public Services.</P>
<P>That they are &s;upplyed with Rum by the Traders, in va&s;t and almo&s;t incredible Quantities; the Laws of the Colonies now in Force, being in&s;ufficient to re&s;train the Supply. And the <HI>Indians</HI> of every Nation, are frequently drunk, and abu&s;ed in their Trade,
<PB N="8" REF="007433_0008_102D860590D41EE8">and their Affection thereby alienated from the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> they often wound and murder one another in their Liquor, and to avoid Revenge, fly to the <HI>French;</HI> and perhaps more have been lo&s;t by the&s;e Means, than by the <HI>French</HI> Artifice.</P>
<P>That Purcha&s;es of Land from the <HI>Indians</HI> by private Per&s;ons, for &s;mall trifling Con&s;iderations, have been the Cau&s;e of great Unea&s;ine&s;s and Di&s;contents; and if the <HI>Indians</HI> are not in fact impo&s;ed on and injured, yet they are apt to think they have been; and indeed, they appear not fit to be entru&s;ted at Large, with the Sale of their own Lands: And the Laws of &s;ome of the Colonies, which make &s;uch Sales void, unle&s;s the Allowance of the Government be fir&s;t obtained, &s;eem to be well founded.</P>
<P>That the Granting or Patenting va&s;t Tracts of Land to pri|vate Per&s;ons or Companies, without Conditions of &s;peedy Set|tlements, has tended to prevent the Strengthening the Frontiers of the particular Colony where &s;uch Tracts lie, and been Preju|dicial to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>That it &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;peedy and effectual Mea&s;ures be taken, to &s;ecure the Colonies from the Slavery they are threatned with; that any farther Advances of the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould be prevented; and the Encroachments already made, removed.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Indians</HI> in Alliance or Friend&s;hip with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> be con&s;tantly regarded under &s;ome wi&s;e Direction or Superintend|ancy. That Endeavours be u&s;ed for the Recovery of tho&s;e <HI>In|dians</HI> who are lately gone over to the <HI>French,</HI> and for &s;ecuring tho&s;e that remain. That &s;ome di&s;creet Per&s;on or Per&s;ons be appointed to re&s;ide con&s;tantly among each Nation of <HI>Indians;</HI> &s;uch Per&s;on to have no Concern in Trade, and duly to commu|nicate all Advices to the Superintendants.</P>
<P>That the Trade with the &s;aid <HI>Indians</HI> be well regulated, and made &s;ub&s;ervient to the Public Intere&s;t, more than to private Gain.</P>
<P>That there be Forts built for the Security of each Nation, and the better carrying on the Trade with them. That warlike Ve&s;&s;els be provided, &s;ufficient to maintain His Maje&s;ty's Right to a free Navigation on the &s;everal Lakes.</P>
<P>That all future Purcha&s;es of Lands from the <HI>Indians</HI> be void, unle&s;s made by the Government where &s;uch Lands lie, and from the <HI>Indians</HI> in a Body, in their public Councils. That the Pa|tentees or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of large un&s;ettled Territories, be enjoined to cau&s;e them to be &s;ettled in a rea&s;onable Time, on Pain of For|feiture.</P>
<P>That the Complaints of the <HI>Indians,</HI> relative to any Grants or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of their Lands, fraudulently obtained, be inquired into, and all Injuries redre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>That the Grand Council &s;hall meet once in every Year, and oftener if Occa&s;ion require, at &s;uch Time and Place as they &s;hall adjourn to at the la&s;t preceding Meeting, of as they &s;hall be called to meet at, by the Pre&s;ident General on any Emergency; he having fir&s;t obtained in writing, the Con&s;ent of &s;even of the Members to &s;uch Call, and &s;ent due and timely Notice to the whole.</P>
<P>That the Grand Council have Power to chu&s;e their Speaker, and &s;hall neither be di&s;&s;olved, prorogued, nor continue &s;itting longer than &s;ix Weeks at one time, without their own Con&s;ent, or the &s;pecial Command of the Crown.</P>

<P>That the A&s;&s;ent of the Pre&s;ident General be requi&s;ite to all Acts of the Grand Council; and that it be his Office and Duty to cau&s;e them to be carried into Execution.</P>

<P>That they make Laws for regulating and governing &s;uch new Settlements, 'till the Crown &s;hall think fit to form them into particular Government.</P>
<P>That they may rai&s;e and pay Soldiers, and build Forts for the Defence of any of the Colonies, and equip Ve&s;&s;els of force to guard the Coa&s;t, and protect the Trade on the Ocean, Lakes, or great Rivers; but they &s;hall not impre&s;s Men in any Colony, without the Con&s;ent of its Legi&s;lature.</P>

<P>That they may appoint a general Trea&s;urer and a particular Trea&s;urer in each Government, when nece&s;&s;ary; and from time to time, may order the Sums in the Trea&s;uries of each Govern|ment, into the General Trea&s;ury, or draw on them for &s;pecial Payments, as they find mo&s;t convenient; yet no Money to i&s;&s;ue, but by joint Orders of the Pre&s;ident General and Grand Council, except where Sums have been appropriated to particular Pur|po&s;es, and the Pre&s;ident General is previou&s;ly impowered by an Act, to draw for &s;uch Sums.</P>

<P>That the Laws made by them for the Purpo&s;es afore&s;aid, &s;hall not be repugnant, but as near as may be agreable, to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;hall be tran&s;mitted to the King in Council, for Approbation, as &s;oon as may be, after their pa&s;&s;ing; and if not di&s;approved within three Years after Pre&s;entation, to remain in Force.</P>
<P>That in Ca&s;e of the Death of the Pre&s;ident General, the Speaker of the Grand Council for the Time being, &s;hall &s;ucceed, and be ve&s;ted with the &s;ame Power and Authorities, and continue 'till the King's Plea&s;ure be known.</P>
<P>That all Military Commi&s;&s;ion Officers, whether for Land or Sea Service, to act under this General Con&s;titution, be nominated
<PB N="12" REF="007433_0012_102D860E21AA35B8">by the Pre&s;ident General, but the Approbation of the Grand Council is to be obtained, before they receive their Commi&s;&s;ions. And all Civil Officers are to be nominated by the Grand Coun|cil, and to receive the Pre&s;ident General's Approbation, before they officiate. But in Ca&s;e of Vacancy, by Death or Removal of any Officer, Civil or Military, under this Con&s;titution, the Governor of the Provinces in which &s;uch Vacancy happens, may appoint, 'till the Plea&s;ure of the Pre&s;ident General and Grand Council can be known.</P>
<P>That the particular Military as well as Civil E&s;tabli&s;hments in each Colony, remain in their pre&s;ent State, this General Con&s;ti|tution notwith&s;tanding; and that of &s;udden Emergencies, any Colony may defend it&s;elf, and lay the Accounts of Expence thence ari&s;en, before the Pre&s;ident General and Grand Council, who may allow and order Payment of the &s;ame, as far as they judge &s;uch Accounts ju&s;t and rea&s;onable.</P>

<P>ORDERED, That all His Maje&s;ty's Governments on this Con|tinent, may have Liberty from time to time, to take Copies of the Proceedings of this Congre&s;s, or any Parts thereof, paying for the &s;ame; and that no other Copies be delivered by the Secretary.</P>

<P>THUS having &s;een Ab&s;tracts of the Authorities given the Commi&s;&s;ioners who were at <HI>Albany,</HI> and of tho&s;e Letters from the Crown, which occa&s;ioned &s;uch Authorities to be given; together with the State of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> and the propo&s;ed Plan of Union, formed in Con&s;equence of the whole: From and impartial View thereof, let every Man judge, Whether it was not the Intent of all the Colonies who &s;ent Commi&s;&s;ioners, that they &s;hould form &s;ome <HI>General Scheme</HI> or <HI>Plan,</HI> for the Safety and Defence of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies, and the <HI>Indians</HI> in their Alliance? Look into the Commi&s;&s;ion from Governor <HI>Greene:</HI> and after full Powers are given to do every Thing relative to the <HI>Indians</HI> in Alliance with us, What mean the&s;e following Words? <Q>And al&s;o, <HI>what el&s;e may be nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to prohibit the <HI>French,</HI> and their Allies the <HI>Indians,</HI> from encroaching on the Lands within the Dominions of His Maje&s;ty. And in general, as far as the Abilities of this Government will permit, <HI>to act in Conjunction</HI> with the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners, in every Thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the Good of His Maje&s;ty's Subjects in the&s;e Parts. And to an&s;wer as far as we can, the De&s;igns of His Maje&s;ty's In&s;tructions to this Colony, communicated to us by the Earl of <HI>Holderne&s;&s;e.</HI></Q> Surely &s;uch Words as the&s;e, have &s;ome Meaning;
<PB N="13" REF="007433_0013_102D8610519E8F20">and if the Commi&s;&s;oners were &s;o unhappy as quite to mi&s;take their Meaning, let tho&s;e penetrating Wits who think &s;o, &s;hew to the World, how they are to be under&s;tood. But if tho&s;e Authorities were too exten&s;ive, let them be blamed who gave &s;uch Authori|ties, and not tho&s;e who executed them in the mo&s;t &s;paring Man|ner po&s;&s;ible. And will any Man believe, &s;uch exact Likene&s;s in Sub&s;tance, &s;hould be in the Authorities given by every Govern|ment to their Commi&s;&s;ioners, without having any Conference together about it, if the Directions from the Crown had not pointed it out to them in &s;o plain a Manner, that they all under&s;tood them alike? And is it not as plain, from the Letters &s;ince received from the Secretaries of State, that they all under&s;tood them in the Sen&s;e the King intended them?</P>
<P>Altho' all this were allowed, yet &s;ome may &s;ay, If you had Powers given you to enter into &s;ome &s;uch General Scheme, you ought not to have con&s;ented to one &s;o hurtful and de&s;tructive of our Liberties as this is! Whether the Plan formed at <HI>Albany,</HI> be a good one, or a bad one, I &s;hall not undertake to determin; yet let it be con&s;idered, that the <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners were but two of the whole Number, and therefore were far from being able to govern or form Things as they might think be&s;t; neither did they ever pretend they could not be mi&s;taken; and Errors of Judgment will always be forgiven by Men of Candor.</P>
<P>And now let us examin what the Commi&s;&s;ioners did relating to this Plan, and we &s;hall find, they did no more than form it, and agree to lay it before the General A&s;&s;emblies of the Colonies from whence they came, for their Con&s;ideration. They did not, as is fal&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, order it to be &s;ent Home. They did not e&s;tabli&s;h it as an Act or Ordinance of the Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners, as they all might have done, by the Authorities given them. They did not leave it in the Power of any one to obtain a Copy of it, and &s;end it Home; but &s;trictly forbid their Secretary to give any Copy, except to the Colonies. Nor did they ever agree to any Thing more, than to carry it to their re&s;pective Governments, and lay it before their Con&s;tituents. And agreable to the Re&s;olve of the Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners, tho&s;e from <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> did lay this Plan, with all other their Proceedings at <HI>Albany,</HI> before the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly, at their Se&s;&s;ion in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t, for their Con&s;ider|ation. Was this criminal! Was this betraying their Tru&s;t! Or was there any Thing more in this, than their Duty! Even Envy and Ignorance joined together, cannot &s;ay there was! And tho&s;e who have been bold enough to A&s;&s;ert, That any Thing more relating to this Plan of Union was done, &s;uffered to be done, or connived at, by the Commi&s;&s;ioners, are hereby publicly called upon, to prove their A&s;&s;ertions, or confe&s;s their Fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>Once more, let us hold up this &s;o much talked of, <HI>Plan of Union,</HI> and view it in another Light: And here, to do my Ad|ver&s;aries all the Ju&s;tice they can po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire, I will, for Argu|ment-&s;ake, confe&s;s it to be as bad as they repre&s;ent it to be. Viewing it in this Light, it mu&s;t be &s;ound contrary to, and &s;ub|ver&s;ive of our happy Con&s;titution, and all tho&s;e valuable Privileges
<PB N="14" REF="007433_0014_102DAE9F54787A80" MS="y">we enjoy under it. This de&s;tructive Plan was laid before the General A&s;&s;embly, for their Con&s;ideration, in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t: This gave an Opportunity to tho&s;e Patriots belonging to the Council, who now &s;ay &s;o much again&s;t this Plan, to have exerted them&s;elves in Defence of our Liberties, &s;o much in Dan|ger, and prevented the di&s;mal Effects &s;o much &s;eared. Well! What have the&s;e Champions for Liberty, done in this Matter? Have they not let it lie before the A&s;&s;embly between &s;ix and seven Months, without taking it once under Con&s;ideration? Or, Have they ever rejected it? or &s;o much as once in all this Time, moved to have one Word wrote Home, to prevent its taking Place? Was it bad, as they &s;ay 'tis, then certainly 'twas their Duty to have done all in their Power to prevent its taking Effect. All Men mu&s;t confe&s;s, the Plan was either good or bad; if 'twas good, Why do they blame it? if 'twas bad, Why have they done Nothing about it?</P>
<P>Now, let every &s;ober-minded Man determin, Whether the&s;e Men can be real Friends to the Colony, who placed in the fore|mo&s;t Offices, and intru&s;ted with its Safety, could let a Thing &s;o dangerous to its Intere&s;t, lie unob&s;erved by the General A&s;&s;embly, near &s;even Months, 'till perhaps it may be too late to prevent it? And then to &s;erve a private Party Turn, &s;uddenly to roar out, <HI>The Colony is in Danger!</HI> All who have Eyes, will &s;ee thro' &s;uch thin Di&s;gu&s;es, and be a&s;&s;ured, that the De&s;igns of the&s;e Men, are only to bla&s;t the Reputation of one of the <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, who at pre&s;ent may &s;eem to &s;tand in their Way; and not to do the Colony any Service; for if that had been the Ca&s;e, they would have told us the&s;e Things &s;ooner.</P>
<P>What could the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> have done more? or what could they have done le&s;s than they did, relative to this Plan? It was not in their Power to procure a better; and whe|ther it was good or bad, it was equally their Duty to lay it be|fore the A&s;&s;embly who &s;ent them: They did &s;o, and did no more; and every Member of both Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly can bear Witne&s;s, I have never u&s;ed the lea&s;t Endeavour to induce them to accede to it. If it is bad, as &s;ome are pleas'd to repre&s;ent it, Mu&s;t not every Man &s;ay. They who have &s;uffered it to lie thus long, are the very Men who have betrayed their Tru&s;t, and the Intere&s;t of the Colony?</P>
<P>Real want of Merit, occa&s;ions the&s;e Men's Endeavour to ri&s;e upon the Ruin of their neighbour's Reputation. But can the Faults of my Neighbour, make me fit for an Office? And can the valuable Privileges of this Colony be &s;afe in tho&s;e Hands, where every Thing el&s;e &s;eems to be neglected, but what will &s;erve their private Purpo&s;es? As I am a Candidate for an Office, I &s;incerely de&s;ire all Men may put their Country's Intere&s;t in the fir&s;t Place, and give their Votes only where they think 'tis mo&s;t &s;afe; and a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves, &s;uch a Conduct will perfectly plea&s;e the Colony's, and their Friend,</P>
