<HI>There is a Voice of</HI> GOD <HI>unto the Children of Men; Yea, a</HI> MIGHTY VOICE: <HI>And therefore a Voice Mightily to be hearken'd to.</HI></P>
<P>THE Entertainment, I Suppo&s;e, would not have been Unprofitable, if I &s;hould have Enquired, <HI>What is the Voice of GOD, and what is it that the Mighty Voice of our GOD Speaks unto us?</HI> You are all aware, That in the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> which is the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, we have the <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of God, Speaking to us, in the Plainne&s;t Manner that can be. Our JESUS who <HI>Spake as never Man Spake,</HI> did never <HI>Speak,</HI> in the Dayes of His Fle&s;h among us, but, <HI>GOD Uttered His Voice,</HI> in the mo&s;t familiar Way that can be imagined. But there is al&s;o the <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD in all the Oracles of the <HI>Go&s;pel;</HI> GOD in&s;pired the Writers of the&s;e Oracles, and there is a <HI>Mighty Voice of GOD</HI> in the In&s;piration. Where the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> comes, <HI>The Great Trumpet is blown,</HI> and there is a <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of GOD, in the <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> of that <HI>Jubilee.</HI> Sirs, It would be Well, if you would be Prevailed upon, When you <HI>Take up</HI> the <HI>Bible,</HI> and Open it, then to think, <HI>The Mighty Voice of GOD is now Speaking to me;</HI> And when <HI>Qualified Preachers</HI> Open the <HI>Bible</HI> unto you, then again to think, <HI>The Mighty Voice of GOD, is what I must now give ear|nest Heed unto.</HI> Methinks, You &s;hould be al&s;o aware, That in the Dictates of our <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> we have the <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of GOD unto us. The <HI>Principle</HI> in Man, which acts in a Way of <HI>Judging</HI> on him, as <HI>Under the Judgment of GOD;</HI> tho' the Dictates of that <HI>Prin|ciple,</HI> are a Sort of <HI>Whi&s;pers,</HI> yet there are al&s;o <HI>Thun|ders</HI> in them: <HI>It cryes with a Loud Voice, as when a Lion roars!</HI> Oh! that Men were more fearful of
<PB N="3" REF="001688_0004_0FB52A84D5D395E0"><HI>Rebelling against the Light,</HI> and again&s;t the <HI>Voice</HI> of a <HI>Principle,</HI> which, O ra&s;h Man, if thou put continual Sleights upon, will One Day <HI>Tear thee to Pieces, and there &s;hall be none to deliver thee.</HI> Yea, I will &s;ay unto you, <HI>Sound Rea&s;on</HI> is always the <HI>Voice of GOD.</HI> When ever any Maxim, or Demand of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> is Of|fered unto us, We have GOD Speaking unto us. My Brethren, If you will <HI>Shew your &s;elves Men,</HI> and <HI>Hearken to Rea&s;on,</HI> You may fill your Lives with <HI>Acts of Obedience</HI> unto GOD. Whatever you &s;ee to be <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> Conform to it, from this Con&s;ideration, <HI>Tis what GOD Calls me to!</HI></P>
<P>BUT then, You mu&s;t be as much aware of this; That there is a <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of GOD, in all the <HI>Works</HI> of His Hands. All His Di&s;pen&s;ations are <HI>Speaking Di&s;pen&s;ations.</HI> The Works of <HI>Creation;</HI> There <HI>is no Speech nor Language, Where their Voice is not heard.</HI> All the <HI>Creatures</HI> of GOD are &s;o many <HI>Teachers</HI> to us. <HI>A&s;k them now, and they &s;hall teach thee;</HI> Yea, the <HI>Mute&s;t</HI> of them <HI>&s;hall declare unto thee.</HI> The Works of <HI>Providence</HI> too; <HI>Stand &s;till, and Con&s;ider the&s;e Wondrous Works of God;</HI> That is, To <HI>Hear</HI> what they <HI>Speak</HI> un|to us. The <HI>General Providence</HI> of GOD, which <HI>Pre|&s;erves</HI> and <HI>Governs</HI> the World, has a <HI>Voice</HI> to all the World; The <HI>Wheels</HI> of it make a <HI>Noi&s;e</HI> in their Mo|tions. But &s;o too has the <HI>Special Providence.</HI> There is a <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD unto us, in what we &s;ee befalling of <HI>Others.</HI> The <HI>Rewarding</HI> of the <HI>Righteous,</HI> and the <HI>Puni&s;hing</HI> of the <HI>Wicked,</HI> has alwayes a <HI>Voice</HI> in it, unto all the Spectators of it. But &mdash; much more in what we feel befalling <HI>Our &s;elves.</HI> Do we meet with <HI>Agreeable</HI> Things? <HI>I Speak unto thee in thy Pro&s;perity, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> &mdash; Oh! but what follows? &mdash; Do we meet with <HI>Deplorable</HI> Things? Now, <HI>Hear
<PB N="4" REF="001688_0005_0FB52A8658CF4D98">the Rod; the Voice of the Lord Cryes unto the Sufferer.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Sum</HI> of the <HI>Voice,</HI> even the <HI>Mighty Voice,</HI> You cannot but be aware, and appri&s;ed of it. It is that of the <HI>Angel</HI> with the <HI>Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, Saying with a Loud Voice, Fear GOD, and give Glory to HIM.</HI> 'Tis,
<Q>O <HI>Acknowledge</HI> the Glorious GOD in all Your Wayes; Make it the <HI>Chief End</HI> of your Lives, to Render and Procure, continual Acknow|ledgments of His <HI>Glories.</HI> Place your Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, in the Enjoyment of Him. Embrace the Lovely JE|SUS in all His Offices, as the <HI>Only Saviour,</HI> to bring you unto that Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. Be afraid of all <HI>Sin</HI> again&s;t the Holy Lord. Be Weaned from a <HI>World,</HI> wherein Satisfaction is to be de&s;paired of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the <HI>Wi&s;er</HI> and the <HI>Better</HI> for all that befalls you; and let GOD have <HI>Revenues</HI> to His Kingdom, out of all that He does for you, or on you. Walk with GOD, and be <HI>Holy in all manner of Conver&s;ation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS the <HI>Voice.</HI> No Doubt, I might have gone on Profitably, to have told you, <HI>How and Why the Mighty Voice of GOD is Mightily to be hearkened to?</HI> To have told you, That to Study the Mind of God in His <HI>Voice,</HI> and to <HI>be,</HI> and to <HI>do</HI> what is therein called for, is to Hearken to it. And then, to have told you, that &s;ince 'tis the <HI>Mighty Voice of GOD,</HI> there need no other <HI>Argument</HI> for its being <HI>Mightily Hearken'd to.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash; BUT it is another Entertainment, That I have under the Impre&s;&s;ions of GOD, and with His A&s;&s;i&s;tences, Prepared for you.</P>

&para; THE <HI>De&s;ign</HI> which I Propo&s;e this Day to Pro&s;ecute, is, That the <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glorious GOD, even His <HI>Mighty Voice,</HI> in the <HI>Later Di&s;pen&s;ations</HI> of His Providence towards this Land, may be Re|garded, be Under&s;tood, be Complied withal.</P>
<P>WHEN the former <HI>Long War,</HI> which our Treache|rous and Barbarous <HI>Enemies</HI> made upon us, was fi|ni&s;hed, there was an <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> to make &s;ome Improve|ment of the <HI>Ob&s;ervable Things</HI> that had occurred in it: An <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> which God and His People approved of.</P>
<P>ANOTHER <HI>Long War</HI> is now fini&s;hed; A <HI>New Peace</HI> hath been &s;truck up, in our Borders: And it is Time to Con&s;ider the <HI>Voice</HI> of our God unto us, in the <HI>Ob&s;ervable Things</HI> that have therein Pa&s;&s;ed over us. For, <HI>O my Dear People,</HI> While thy God has been <HI>Striking</HI> of thee, He has been al&s;o <HI>Speaking</HI> to thee; And it is of the La&s;t Con&s;equence, that His <HI>Voice</HI> be Wi&s;ely hearkened to; A Total Inadvertency to the <HI>Voice,</HI> will have a Con&s;equence which we may ju&s;tly tremble at; &mdash; If to be <HI>Puni&s;hed yet Ten times for our Iniquities,</HI> or with more than <HI>Ten Years</HI> of Con|fu&s;ions repeared upon us, be a thing to be trembled at.</P>
<P>IT is an <HI>Holy Undertaking;</HI> may it be a very <HI>U&s;eful</HI> One!</P>
<P>FROM &s;uch an <HI>Holy Undertaking,</HI> we mu&s;t not be di&s;couraged, by the Deri&s;ion of a few Fooli&s;h, and Fla&s;hy, and Prophane Creatures, (no more to be valued than the Dirt of a <HI>Street</HI>) who Scoff at all <HI>Sermons</HI> of an <HI>Hi&s;torical Importance;</HI> that is to &s;ay. At &s;uch <HI>Sermons</HI> as the Prophets of God have all over the Bible Exemplified unto us; Creatures below the

<P>WHEREFORE, Having this Opportunity, of Seeing the <HI>Elders</HI> and the <HI>Judges</HI> of our <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> here a&s;&s;embled, I call upon you, <HI>Stand Still, that I may Rea&s;on with you before the Lord,</HI> Concerning the <HI>Righteous Acts</HI> which He hath done among you, and His <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> in tho&s;e <HI>Acts,</HI> which He Expects you to take a <HI>Rea&s;onable</HI> and a <HI>Religious</HI> Notice of.</P>
<P>GOD forbid, That a People of our <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Original,</HI> &s;hould be &s;o abandoned by the <HI>Spirit of Piety,</HI> as to be In&s;en&s;ible, that there is a <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glorious GOD unto us, even a <HI>Mighty Voice,</HI> in the Things which He has di&s;pen&s;ed unto us, during our <HI>Long War,</HI> with the <HI>Ea&s;tern Salvages,</HI> and the bloody <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> that have in&s;pired them and abetted them. Verily, Such an In&s;en&s;ibility would but bring us within the reach of that flaming Thunderbolt; P&s;al. XXVIII. 5. <HI>Becau&s;e they regard not the Works of the Lord, nor the Operation of His Hands, He &s;hall de&s;troy them, and not build them up.</HI> I again &s;ay, <HI>God forbid!</HI></P>
<P>BUT then, the <HI>First</HI> Thing, Whereto your At|tention is demanded, is; That the <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glo|rious GOD, even His <HI>Mighty Voice,</HI> in the <HI>Long War</HI>

You &s;hall have it all in a <HI>Summary Way,</HI> and in Ex|pre&s;&s;ive Terms provided as long ago, as, 2 Chron. XV. 5, 6. <HI>In tho&s;e times, there was no Peace, to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great Vexations were upon all the Inhabitants of the Countries; For God did Vex them with all Adver&s;ity.</HI> And certainly, the <HI>Voice</HI> of God has been Extended unto <HI>All the Inhabi|tants;</HI> who have <HI>All</HI> been Sharers in the <HI>Great Vexa|tions</HI> of this Long <HI>Adver&s;ity.</HI> Truely, We have <HI>All</HI> been <HI>Sufferers.</HI> How many have Suffered in their <HI>Per&s;ons?</HI> Not a few, have <HI>Endured Hard&s;hips as Good Souldiers</HI> in the Publick Service.

Surely, we have <HI>All</HI> been <HI>Sinners</HI> too! And this, no doubt, <HI>this</HI> is the <HI>Voice</HI> of our Glorious GOD unto us <HI>All. Hear this All ye People, Every One of you!

VIII. 6. <HI>I hearkened and heard, but they Spake not aright; No Men repented him of his Wickedne&s;s, Saying, What have I done?</HI> Oh! May it not be heard over us! The <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of our God unto us, is; <HI>Let every Man Enquire, What Errors of his Own have thrown Oyl into the Flame of that Anger that has been &s;uch a Devouring Fire upon you.</HI> And, <HI>Let every Man Enquire, What he &s;hall do, that tho' God has been Angry, His Anger may be turned away, and His People may be Comforted.</HI></P>
<P>BESURE, We are deaf to <HI>Thunder,</HI> if we do not hear this <HI>Voice</HI> of our God unto us all, in what we have all met withal: <HI>Oh! Take off your Hearts from a World, which I have &s;o many wayes Embittered unto you all. Prefer, Pur&s;ue, Expect a Portion in a better World.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if the <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of God may be appre|hended as mo&s;t Cogently, and mo&s;t Pungently di|rected unto them that have been the <HI>Greatest Sufferers,</HI> 'tis to be hoped our dear Brethren in the <HI>Frontiers,</HI> will be mo&s;t Suitably Affected with it.

SHALL I make a brief <HI>Recapitulation?</HI></P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured</HI> have we been of our GOD, in So Vigilant a Care, and Guard, which has kept our Frontiers, for <HI>Two Hundred</HI> Miles together, So Forti|fied, and in &s;uch a Way of <HI>Communication,</HI> that the Salvages have been afraid of attempting Frequent <HI>Surpri&s;als</HI> upon them? Our GOD <HI>Speaks</HI> this unto us; <HI>Behold, An Hedge of My making about you!</HI></P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured?</HI> &mdash; When formidable Armies of the <HI>French,</HI> in Conjunction with the <HI>Salvages</HI> from <HI>Canada,</HI> &s;everal times, have <HI>gone forth with great fury to Destroy, and Utterly to make away many:</HI> and e&s;pe|cially to Cut off the Praying People of God in the Towns of the Northern County on <HI>Connecticut-River:</HI> Either they have Mutiny'd among them&s;elves; Or, &s;ome De&s;erter from them&s;elves has come in unto us: &mdash; there has happened <HI>Something,</HI> that has cau&s;ed them to do <HI>Nothing.</HI> When they have <HI>Come upon us, to Eat up our Fle&s;h,</HI> they have <HI>Stumbled,</HI> and <HI>Fallen,</HI> and tho' after Long Marches, ju&s;t arrived in our Borders, they have gone back without Striking a Stroke. Or, if not &s;o, a <HI>Kind Friend</HI> of Ours, has Obliged us with a Timely Intelligence, of what Mi&s;|chief has been hatching again&s;t us; A Friend&s;hip for ever to be gratefully acknowledged!</P>
<P>UPON the Saying of which, I ought to Mention it, That there was in the <HI>Former War,</HI> a Gentleman, who hazarded his very Life, and Procured no little Unea&s;ine&s;s unto him&s;elf, by tran&s;mitting to us, an Advice of Mi&s;chiefs impending over us: The Me|rits of which Action &s;hould not be &s;oon forgotten with us.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="001688_0024_0FB52AAB2D2EC1D8">
BUT by &s;uch means as the&s;e, the Enemy, have hardly above <HI>Once,</HI> been able to do any thing to Purpo&s;e, in all their Enterprizes. They have <HI>gone round about the City, and made a Noi&s;e like a Dog:</HI> By'nd by they have <HI>Returned,</HI> and <HI>Wandred up and down for Meat,</HI> and <HI>grudged</HI> becau&s;e they were <HI>not Satisfyed.</HI></P>
<P>GOD <HI>Speaks</HI> to us in this; <HI>Oh! Trust Me: Oh! Love Me; Oh! See what it is to be under My Pro|tection!</HI></P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured?</HI> &mdash; When the rich <HI>Store-Ships</HI> bound for <HI>Canada,</HI> and fill'd with In&s;truments of Death, have been taken by our <HI>Fleets;</HI> and the mo&s;t Capable and Re&s;olved Per&s;ecutors of the&s;e Colonies, have been Killed aboard them.</P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured?</HI> &mdash; When <HI>Privateers</HI> infe&s;ting our Coa&s;ts, have by Storms, <HI>[Fulfilling thy Word, O our God!]</HI> been Shipwreck'd on them. Or &s;ome of our Neighbours, E&s;pecially from One Helpful I&s;land of our Neighbourhood, have with Sudden and Valiant Exploits, made them repent of their appreaching us.</P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favour'd?</HI> &mdash; When we not only laid Wa&s;te many <HI>French</HI> Settlements, where the <HI>Indians</HI> had been Harboured and Supplyed; but anon their Citadel, with their whole Country, fell into our hands; and that <HI>Jericho,</HI> having been <HI>Comte&s;&s;ed Seven Dayes,</HI> fell before us. I Speak <HI>Literally</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nough in that Circum&s;tance!</P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured?</HI> &mdash; In the Many and Ready A&s;&s;i&s;tences, which our Brethren of the Neighbour
<PB N="24" REF="001688_0025_0FB52AAC97543E88">Colonies, have Lent unto us. Our GOD <HI>Speaks</HI> this unto us in it, <HI>Be Tender of One another! My Colonies, Love and Live as Brethren. I will have no unbrotherly Emulations among you.</HI></P>
<P>AND certainly the A&s;&s;i&s;tences that we have given to our Neighbours, &mdash; Our Brethren in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> will certainly in all Things do the part of <HI>Our Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured?</HI> &mdash; In that altho' the Prodigi|ous <HI>Debts</HI> we have Contracted, One would have thought, mu&s;t have broke us, yet we find our &s;elves able to di&s;charge the&s;e Ponderous <HI>Debts;</HI> Yea, our <HI>Debts</HI> have rather Enriched us, by affording a <HI>Fund</HI> for the <HI>Circulation of Credit,</HI> among us.</P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured?</HI> &mdash; When in the mid&s;t of <HI>Our</HI> Charges, and Lo&s;&s;es, and Various Troubles, we have been mov'd and help'd from Above, to Expre&s;s our Charity for our Friends in the <HI>Caribbee-I&s;lands,</HI> and &s;end &s;ome Ta&s;te of our Bounty to them in <HI>theirs.</HI> Let not Ignorant Strangers abu&s;e <HI>New-England,</HI> un|til they Out-do that Poor Country in the Things, that every One mu&s;t Confe&s;s to be Laudable.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, Some Servants of God have had the <HI>Un&s;peakable Satisfaction</HI> of Expre&s;&s;ing and Ob|taining Bounties, for <HI>Odd People,</HI> among whom it has been a General Practice and Plea&s;ure, to be Ig|norantly and Venemou&s;ly Railing at them. &mdash; <HI>For|give them; They know not what they do!</HI></P>
<P>AND how <HI>Favoured?</HI> &mdash; When under all the <HI>Creepling Di&s;advantages</HI> of the Country, We &s;ee the

Yea, we &s;ee the ancient <HI>Fable</HI> of the <HI>Phaenix</HI> ri&s;ing out of its <HI>A&s;hes,</HI> Moralized and Verified, O BOSTON, in thy ri&s;ing out of <HI>thine:</HI> Things done for thee, the Re|port whereof will be thought a <HI>Fable,</HI> by them that have not &s;een them.</P>
<P>SIRS, There is a <HI>Voice,</HI> yea, a <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of our Glorious GOD unto us in all the&s;e things. He be&s;peaks our <HI>Thankful Prai&s;es,</HI> to Him, in all the&s;e things: This I am certain of!</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t not be Left uncon&s;idered among the <HI>Fa|vours</HI> of our GOD, that we have all this while, Enjoy'd His GOSPEL, in the Privileges whereof we have been <HI>Lifted up to Heaven.</HI> Our GOD has fulfill'd that Word unto us; I&s;ai. XXX. 20. <HI>Tho' they Lord give You the Bread of Adver&s;ity, and the Water of Affliction, yet thine Eyes &s;hall &s;ee thy Teachers.</HI></P>
<P>ONE of the Lea&s;t among them, is now doing his Part, that our <HI>Adver&s;ity</HI> and our <HI>Affliction</HI> may be rendred Profitable to us.</P>
<P>BUT, that our <HI>Matchle&s;s,</HI> and our <HI>Envy'd</HI> GOSPEL &s;hall be continued unto us, do we &s;ee nothing like a <HI>Rainbow</HI> in the <HI>Briti&s;h-Heaven,</HI> to give us a <HI>Token,</HI> upon which they who <HI>dwell in the Wilderne&s;s</HI> may be le&s;s <HI>Afraid</HI> than a <HI>Cloudy Day</HI> may have &s;ometimes rendered them?</P>
<P>YES, Unto our Inexpre&s;&s;ible Satisfaction, we now &s;ee a&s;cending to the <HI>Briti&s;h Throne,</HI> A KING, for whom his NEW-ENGLISH People have continually
<PB N="26" REF="001688_0027_0FB52AB055A277A8">Offered up their mo&s;t Earne&s;t <HI>Vows</HI> to the GOD <HI>by whom Kings Reign,</HI> that they may &s;ee Him, and His Illu&s;trious Family, in the Succe&s;&s;ion runing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er them.</P>
<P>A KING, Who cannot in any of His Dominions, have more Loyal, Faithful, and Hearty Subjects, than His NEW-ENGLISH People; who are by <HI>Principle</HI> as well as <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> rendred &s;o.</P>
<P>A KING, from whom we have all the Rea&s;on imaginable to Expect it, that He will not only Con|tinue the <HI>Civil and Religious Liberties</HI> of a People who &s;o many wayes recommend them&s;elves unto. His <HI>Royal Chemency,</HI> but al&s;o that He will Multiply unto them the Tokens of His <HI>Paternal Benignity.</HI></P>
<P>MY Brethren, You hear the <HI>Voice</HI> of your Glorious GOD, even His <HI>Mighty Voice,</HI> in the Changes of His Providence that have Pa&s;&s;ed over you. A <HI>Voice</HI> that &s;peaks this; <HI>Ah! My Poor People; How &s;hall I give thee up: As yet, I cannot do it; I will not do it! Tho' I cha&s;ten thee &s;ore, thou &s;halt not yet be given over to Death!</HI></P>
<P>I have di&s;charged my Duty, and my Sermon &s;hall be fini&s;hed, when I have brought you the <HI>Voice</HI> of your GOD, in that One mo&s;t Intelligible and Un|que&s;tionable <HI>Articulation</HI> of it more; P&s;al. LXXXI. 13, 14, 15. <HI>Oh! that my People had hearkened unto me, and walked in my Wayes? I &s;hould &s;oon have Subdued their Enemies, and have turned my Hand again&s;t their Ad|ver&s;aries; The Haters of the Lord &s;hould have Submitted them&s;elves unto Him; but their own Time &s;hould Endure for ever.</HI></P>

<P>Upon a Review of the Occurrences in my Collection for our <HI>Duodecennium Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uo&s;um,</HI> whereof I have in a <HI>Summary Way</HI> given the Publick a Deli|bation, I take notice of Two or Three <HI>Specialties,</HI> which I &s;hall for &s;ome Rea&s;ons more <HI>Particularly</HI> relate in an <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> THE Action and Exploit of the MEN of Two Shallops belonging to the Religious Town of <HI>York, Sept.</HI> 21. 1707. as I have it, from a Good Friend, <HI>Samuel Penhallow</HI> <ABBR>E&s;qr.</ABBR> (to whom I have been En|debted for very many &s;uch Communications,) appears not Unworthy of a Di&s;tinct Relation. Such a Per|formance, and &s;uch a Deliverance, ought never to be forgotten!</P>
<P>ON board the Shallops, now lying at <HI>Winter-H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|bour,</HI> were the Courageous <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> and <HI>Herman,</HI> and <HI>Cole,</HI> and five MEN more, and a <HI>Boy,</HI> who &s;hall now pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for a <HI>Man.</HI> About Fifty Canoes, in which were th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or four or five Indians apiece, approach'd them, in a Square Body. When the Fleet was come within Thirty Yards of their intended Prey, Ours fired upon them, which fir&s;t Shot put them into Extreme Di&s;order. The Indian Fleet again drawing up in Order of Battel, fired with &s;uch Fury, as obliged ours to quit One of the Shallops; which about fifty of the Enemy Entred, and got the Main&s;ail a-Trip, before ours could get the other to Sail. Ours therefore get out their Oars; but the Enemy was as quick as they, and they joyned Pad|dles on both &s;ides. Ours gaining on them, the Enemy got a dozen Canoes a head, with Fi&s;hing-lines, to tow
<PB N="28" REF="001688_0029_0FB52AB355D76288">after: But in about an hours time, the Wind &s;o fre&s;hened up, that ours Left them, under certain Di&s;advantages, a quarter of a Mile a&s;tern. However the re&s;t of the Cances, all this while Attending and Surrounding of our <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fully</HI> defended Shallep, kept ince&s;&s;antly Firing on our Men, who &s;till bravely an&s;wered them They had a Long Engagement, and were &s;o near One another, that ours felt the Fire of the Enemy in &s;ome &s;ort almo&s;t Scorching of them. Tis an a&s;toni&s;hing Thing! But in this Long &amp; Fierce &amp; Hot Engagement, not One of our good Men was killed. Onely One, who&s;e Name was <HI>Donnel,</HI> (a <HI>Godly</HI> as well as a <HI>Valiant</HI> and for being &s;o not at all the le&s;s <HI>Valiant,</HI> Man,) felt him&s;elf Shot thro' the Bowels, quickly after they fir&s;t came to Sail. At his Fall, he &s;aid, <HI>I am a Dead Man!</HI> But removing him&s;elf a Little, he added, <HI>Let me Kill One before I dye!</HI> &mdash; but found him&s;elf not able to fire. &mdash; After three Hours, in which our Men Spent about five Pounds of Powder, and had not above a Quarter of a Pound Left, the di&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irited Enemy drew off; but not without having a Con&s;iderable Number Killed &amp; Wounded; which tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Time, the continual Cloud of Smoke had Left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> certain, was by Information afterwards a&s;certained. What can Good Men do, when GOD &s;hall Spirit them, Strengthen them, and <HI>Protect</HI> them!</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> THESE had a more Significant <HI>Protection,</HI> than what was enjoy'd by the <HI>French Commander,</HI> in the De&s;cent of the Indians upon <HI>Haverhil.</HI> That our Peo|ple may be entertained with a Ta&s;te of the <HI>French Popery,</HI> and &s;ee a Little, by <HI>Whom</HI> and by <HI>What</HI> our Salvages have been animated; they &s;hall be gratified with One Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>ON <HI>Aug.</HI> 20. 1708. about break of Day, an hundred and fifty Indians, with French Officers and A&s;&s;i&s;tents,
<PB N="29" REF="001688_0030_0FB52AB5959E8008">broke in upon <HI>Haverhil,</HI> and Surpri&s;ed the Center of the Town. Major <HI>Turner</HI> and Captain <HI>Price,</HI> with &s;ome &s;mall Forces happening to be Po&s;ted there, did with much Bravery, Re&s;olution and Celerity, with half the Few Forces they had, give Battel to them; and in le&s;s than an Hour made them fly. Leaving Nine of their Number Dead, be&s;ides what of their Mortally Wounded they carried off.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Dead,</HI> there was a Di&s;tingui&s;hed French|man, who had an <HI>Invulnerating,</HI> and <HI>Immortalizing Amu|let</HI> about his <HI>Neck;</HI> which I now have in my Hand at the Time of my Writing.

<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> IN this <HI>Long War,</HI> there have now and then happened Things, that have had &s;uch Evident Signa|tures of an <HI>Invi&s;ible World</HI> upon them, that they de|&s;erve to be con&s;idered. I &s;hall Single out, but a Couple which are well-atte&s;ted.</P>
<P>THE One is this. <HI>Plutarch</HI> and Others, have Sur|prized us with Relations of <HI>Intelligence</HI> convey'd unto

One of the mo&s;t Notable Things done in our <HI>Twelve-Year</HI> Darkne&s;s, was when Colonel <HI>Hil|ton,</HI> meeting with an happy Information where they were, came upon a con&s;iderable Number of <HI>Indians</HI> in their Wigwams, and Slew all but One, whom they took a Pri&s;oner. Tho' this was done thirty Leagues off <HI>Pert&s;mouth,</HI> yet in the very Morning, when it was done, they had a Di&s;tinct Account of it at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> (None knows how!) even in the Exact, and mo&s;t Minute, Circum&s;tances of it.</P>
<P>THE Other is this; One who&s;e Name was <HI>John Mag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on</HI> was killed, by the <HI>Indians,</HI> at <HI>Exeter.</HI> Three Nights before this, he dream't, that he &s;hould be kill'd by the <HI>Indians,</HI> at a certain <HI>Place,</HI> by his Bro|thers Barn.
