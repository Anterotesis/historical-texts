<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ESTEEM my&s;elf highly honoured,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduction</NOTE> when you reque&s;t of me, a full account of the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and pre&s;ent &s;tate, of the military operations in North-America; with a ju&s;t de|lineation of the characters of the principal agents in our political affairs. Indeed, my Lord, you im|po&s;e a ta&s;k that will require a Volume, rather than a Letter. As your Lord&s;hip's de&s;ire, however, &s;hall always carry with me the force of a command, I will engage in it with the utmo&s;t chearfulne&s;s. Forgive me, my Lord, for &s;aying I have a &s;till &s;tronger motive for compo&s;ing the&s;e &s;heets, than a mere compliance with your Lord&s;hip's reque&s;t; to which I would ever pay the profounde&s;t regard. When I reflect upon your eminent &s;tation&mdash;your

excelling abilities&mdash;your warm and active zeal, for the intere&s;t and welfare of the Briti&s;h colonies; I am prompted by an unfeigned de&s;ire of &s;erving my country; and &s;etting before your Lord&s;hip's eyes TRUTH, in her plain undi&s;gui&s;ed habiliments: I would &s;trip her of all that delu&s;ive colouring, with which &s;he hath been artfully varni&s;hed, by letter-writers from this part of the world; either to &s;ub|&s;erve &s;ome mean &s;ini&s;ter party de&s;ign, or to pro|mote the views of &s;ome a&s;piring and ambitious minds. Candour and integrity &s;hall therefore guide my pen; and amid&s;t the variety with which it is my purpo&s;e to pre&s;ent your Lord&s;hip, it &s;hall be my &s;acred endeavour, to the be&s;t of my knowledge, to attach my&s;elf to the &s;tricte&s;t&mdash;the mo&s;t impartial verity.</P>

power. Nay, &s;hould every other &s;cheme fail, the &s;ucce&s;s of this will inevitably accompli&s;h the long-projected de&s;ign of that a&s;piring nation, for &s;etting up an Univer&s;al Monarchy: for, if France rule the ocean, her re&s;ources will enable her to &s;ubject all Europe to her de&s;potic &s;way. But it is unne|ce&s;&s;ary to offer any arguments in &s;upport of a pro|po&s;ition, of which the public &s;eems to remain no longer in&s;en&s;ible. Happy for us, had the&s;e &s;enti|ments prevailed earlier, and been more frequent|ly inculcated!</P>
<P>THE importance of the colonies, my Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">More con&s;i|dered, on the reduc|tion of Loui&s;bourg,</NOTE> was too little con&s;idered, till the commencement of the la&s;t war. The reduction of Cape Breton by the people of New-England, was an acqui&s;ition &s;o un|expected and fortunate, that America became, on that remarkable event, a more general topic of conver&s;ation. Mr. Shirley, the governor of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, was the principal projector of that glorious enterprize: An enterprize, which reduced to the obedience of his Britanic Maje&s;ty, the DUNKIRK of North-America. Of &s;uch con|&s;equence to the French, was the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that important key to their American &s;ettlements, that its re&s;titution was, in reality, the purcha&s;e of the la&s;t general Peace in Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="011701_0005_0F87EB789E30F930"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Gov. Shirley</NOTE>OF all our plantation Governors, my Lord, Mr. Shirley is mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for his &s;ingular abili|ties. He was born in England, and bred up to the Law, at one of the Inns of Court. In that profe&s;&s;ion he afterwards practi&s;ed, for &s;everal years in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay: and, in 1741, was ad|vanced by his Maje&s;ty to the &s;upreme command of that colony. He is a Gentleman of great political &s;agacity, deep penetration, and indefatigable in|du&s;try. With re&s;pect to the wi&s;dom and equity of his admini&s;tration, he can boa&s;t the univer&s;al &s;uf|frage of a wi&s;e, free, jealous, and moral people. Though not bred to arms, he is eminently po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of the&s;e important military virtues&mdash;An extent of capacity to form and execute great de&s;igns; &mdash; profound &s;ecrecy; &mdash; love of regularity and di&s;|cipline; &mdash; a frugal and laborious manner of living; with the art of conciliating the affections; &mdash; a talent which Hannibal admired in Pyrrhus, above all the re&s;t of his martial accompli&s;hments. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e great qualities, Mr. Shirley is univer|&s;ally acknowledged to &s;hine: and it is, in reality, more e&s;timable, than all other military endowments without it; con&s;i&s;ting, to u&s;e the words of that di&s;|cerning hi&s;torian Mr. Rollin, <Q>in having great views; in forming plans at a di&s;tance; in pro|po&s;ing a de&s;ign, from which the author never

departs; in concerting all the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;ucce&s;s; in knowing how to &s;eize the favourable moments of occa&s;ion, which are rapid in their cour&s;e, and never return; to make even &s;udden and unfore&s;een accidents &s;ub&s;ervient to a plan; in a word, to be upon the watch again&s;t every thing, without being perplexed and di&s;concerted by any event.</Q> But, whether it ari&s;es from his being &s;o far advanced in years, or from his con&s;titutional di&s;po&s;ition and make, he has not, in my opinion, that activity and alertne&s;s &s;o conducive to warlike expedition; and on which the &s;ucce&s;s of an enterprize frequently depends. This was one of the characteri&s;tics of Braddock; a commander, vigorous in executing, as Mr. Shir|ley, judicious in contriving a plan &mdash; <HI>&s;ed non om|nia po&s;&s;umus omnes</HI> &mdash; and 'tis ea&s;ier, my Lord, to find active hands, than able heads.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His atten|tion to co|lony affairs.</NOTE> No man per|haps in the nation, has be&s;towed more attention, upon the &s;tate of the colonies in general: and hav|ing their intere&s;t &s;incerely at heart, he has been perpetually concerting expedients, advancive of their pro&s;perity, and to check the views of an all-gra&s;ping Monarch. Upon the reduction of Loui&s;|burgh, he earne&s;tly recommended to his Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters, the demolition of that fortre&s;s, and an ex|pedition again&s;t the French &s;ettlements in Canada.

Amid&s;t all the &s;plendors and delicacies of Ver&s;ailles, he forgot neither OUR intere&s;t, nor HIS duty. As a proof of his integrity and diligence, during that fruitle&s;s emba&s;&s;y, one need only per|u&s;e the&s;e judicious and laborious memorials, in &s;up|port of his Maje&s;ty's right to Nova Scotia, which were principally framed by him; and lately pu|bli&s;hed by order of the Lords of trade, as a full ex|hibit of our title to that part of America. When no &s;atisfaction could, in this way, be obtained from the Court of France; which was artfully endeavour|ing to &s;pin out the negociation, and at the &s;ame time fortifying the places in que&s;tion, as well as making new acqui&s;itions; the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;aries retired from the French Court, and Mr. Shirley re&s;umed his government in New England in Au|gu&s;t 1753.</P>

Ma+jor Wa&s;hington, a gentleman of whom I &s;hall have occa&s;ion in the &s;equel to make honourable mention, was the bearer of this letter. He returned with an an&s;wer from Mon&s;.

<LETTER>
<P>As I have the honour to command here in chief, Mr. Wa&s;hington delivered me the letter, which you directed to the commandant of the French troops.

<P>I &s;hall immediately forward your letter to Mon&s;. Le Marquis Du Que&s;ne. His an&s;wer will be a law to me: and if he directs me to com|municate it to you, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, I &s;hall neglect nothing that may be nece&s;&s;ary to con|vey it to you with expedition.</P>
<P>;As to the requi&s;ition you make (that I retire with the troops under my command) I cannot believe my&s;elf under any obligation to &s;ubmit to it. I am here, in virtue of my general's or|ders; and I beg, Sir, you would not doubt a moment of my fixed re&s;olution to conform to them, with all the exactitude and &s;teadine&s;s that might be expected from a better officer.</P>
<P>I do not know that, in the cour&s;e of this cam|paign, any thing has pa&s;&s;ed that can be e&s;teem|ed an act of ho&s;tility, or contrary to the trea|ties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two crowns; the continuation of which is as intere&s;ting and plea&s;|ing to us, as it can be to the Engli&s;h.

<P>I have taken particular care to receive Mr. Wa&s;hington, with all the di&s;tinction &s;uitable to your dignity, and to his quality and great merit. I flatter my&s;elf that he will do me this ju&s;tice, and join with me in te&s;tifying the profound re&s;pect with which I am,</P>

Thus the French re|mained ma&s;ters of the field; the Indians were ri|veted in their defection; his Maje&s;ty's arms un|&s;ucce&s;sful; and our frontiers expo&s;ed, through the ill-timed par&s;imony of the provinces. The enemy, on the other hand, wi&s;ely improved the pre&s;ent advantage, and erected forts, to &s;ecure to them|&s;elves the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that fertile country. How evident then was the nece&s;&s;ity of uniting the power of the Briti&s;h colonies! The expediency of a plan for that purpo&s;e had been before con&s;idered.

<P>HE is the elde&s;t branch of one of the fir&s;t families in the province. His father, a French refugee, a gentleman of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank in this city, and who here acquired a large fortune, &s;ent him for his education to the univer&s;ity of Cambridge. He was a youth of prompt parts, and made a con&s;ider|able progre&s;s in learning, e&s;peciallv in the cla&s;&s;ics. In the year 1729 he was, by Governor Montgo|mery's recommendation, created one of his Maje&s;|ty's Council of New-York; but never engaged the public attention, till the time of Mr. Co&s;by. He became then very famous. With this governor he took part in mo&s;t or all of his mea&s;ures &mdash; mea&s;ures extremely arbitrary, and productive of an admini&s;|tration odious and turbulent. Co&s;by, in return for his mini&s;terial &s;ervices, loaded him with favours, Depo&s;ing Chief Ju&s;tice Morris (the main ob&s;tacle to his perilous projects) he rai&s;ed him to the fir&s;t &s;eat on the bench <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. De Lancey was not educated to the law; but having &s;pent &s;ome time, after his return from England, in the &s;tudy of that &s;cience, Gov.

Co&s;by leaving a &s;ucce&s;&s;or capable of go|verning without a prompter, the chief ju&s;tice found it nece&s;&s;ary to to deface the memory of his former conduct, by cultivating the arts of popula|rity. Mr. Clarke, who &s;ucceeded <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In March, 1736.</NOTE>, being per|fectly ma&s;ter of our con&s;titution, a gentleman of experience and penetration, and intimately acquain|ted with the temper of the people, in a &s;hort time reconciled all parties; and by re&s;toring the public tranquility, rendered Mr. De Lancey's plodding abilities utterly u&s;ele&s;s. Hence he was at full lei|&s;ure to court the populace.

To e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch an undue power, and amazing influence, would, in a Grecian common|wealth, have expo&s;ed a man of le&s;s ambition and better principles to the o&s;traci&s;m. Mr. Clark being &s;uper&s;eded by Governor Clinton <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Clinton arrived as Governor, 22 Sept. 1743.</NOTE>, Mr. De Lancey was pre&s;ented with a fre&s;h opportunity for the ex|hibition of his political genius. Mr. Clinton, a gentleman of but indifferent parts, wholly re&s;ign|ed him&s;elf into his hands. Contenting him&s;elf with the title and &s;alary of Governor, he left the &s;ole direction of affairs to his mini&s;ter, who, by virtue of his late acquired omnipotence with the a&s;&s;embly, carried all his points, and even endear|ed him to the people. This intimacy &s;ub&s;i&s;ted no longer than it was found conducive to his de|&s;igns.

Governor, through the intere&s;t of his friends in England, he cared not how &s;oon his excellency abdicated the province, nor how tempe&s;tuous he rendered his ad|mini&s;tration; and was therefore prepared for an open rupture. He no &s;ooner thought him&s;elf cap|able
<PB N="26" REF="011701_0014_0F87EB7F5E2740E8">
of acting independently of the Governor, than, like Sixtus Quintus, who threw a&s;ide his crutches the moment of his exaltation to the popedom, he put off all that humble devotion, by which he had &s;o fatally deceived his too credulous ma&s;ter, and open|ly &s;et him&s;elf at defiance again&s;t him. Now he be|gan to dictate, rather than advi&s;e: and in&s;tead of Sejanus, cho&s;e to be Tiberius him&s;elf. Dining one day with Mr. Clinton, and in&s;i&s;ting upon &s;ome favourite point with great imperiou&s;ne&s;s, the Governor, who had hitherto very cordially &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led, refu&s;ed on this occa&s;ion to be driven. The Chief Ju&s;tice then aro&s;e and left him; declaring, with an oath, he would make his ad|mini&s;tration unea&s;y for the futute: His Excellen|cy replied, he might do his wor&s;t. Thus they parted; nor were ever afterwards reconciled. This breach gave ri&s;e to the contentions, which &s;o unhappily imbroiled our provincial affairs, du|ring the remainder of his admini&s;tration. The a&s;&s;embly were in&s;tantly inflamed. He who before had been able to make them connive at very un|ju&s;tifiable &s;teps, could at once &s;tir up an oppo|&s;ition to the mo&s;t unexceptionable mea&s;ures. Re|mon&s;trances, warm and virulent, were now drawn up; unworthy their own dignity to offer, and re|plete with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t language to his Maje&s;ty's

repre&s;entative. Thus was formed again&s;t Mr. Clinton a powerful party, which cea&s;ed not, while he continued at the helm, to harra&s;s and perplex him. To &s;uch an exhorbitant length did they car|ry their oppo&s;ition, as to throw off the re&s;traint of humanity; They had even recour&s;e to force and violence. Nay, a parti&s;an of the Chief Ju&s;tice, in defiance of the &s;acred rights of the magi&s;tracy and the law &mdash; to &s;hew his re&s;entment again&s;t Mr. Clinton and his adherents &mdash; a&s;&s;aulted the mayor; whipped the &s;heriff; damned the Governor; and &s;tabbed his phy&s;ician. My Lord, we became the &s;port and contempt of our neighbours; and it is beyond contradiction, that Mr. De Lancey, by blowing up the coals of contention, did the pro|vince more injury, then he will ever be able to re|pair. Nor is there any rea&s;on to doubt, that the enormous power of this gentleman, and the fer|ment rai&s;ed again&s;t Mr. Clinton, occa&s;ioned the 39th article of the king's in&s;tructions to Sir Dan|vers O&s;born; which appears purpo&s;ely calculated to render our future Governors independent on his influence over the a&s;&s;embly: For a law indefinite, making provi&s;ion for the &s;alary allowed by the King to his Governors; and competent &s;alaries to all judges, ju&s;tices, and other nece&s;&s;ary officers and mini&s;ters of government &mdash; &s;uch a law, I &s;ay,

&s;tores, and heavy baggage, was led by Col. Dunbar. Never was man more confident of &s;ucce&s;s, than this brave, tho' unfortunate officer. Being advi&s;ed at the great meadows, that that the enemy expected a reinforcement of 500 regular troops, he pu&s;hed on by forced marches, with &s;o much di&s;|patch, that he fatigued the &s;oldiers, weakened his hor&s;es, and left his &s;econd divi&s;ion near 40 miles in the rear, the enemy being not more than 200 &s;trong at their fort on the Ohio, gave no ob&s;tructi|on to the march of our forces, till the memorable 9th of July &mdash; a day never to be forgotten in the annals of North America. About noon our troops pa&s;&s;ed the Monagahela, and were then within &s;e|ven miles of Fort Du Que&s;ne. &mdash; Unapprehen&s;ive of the approach of an enemy, at once was the a|larm given, by a quick and heavy fire upon the van|guard, under Lieut. Col. Gage. Immediately the main body, in good order and high &s;pirits, advan|ced to &s;u&s;tain them. Orders were then given to halt, and form into battalia. At this juncture the van falling back upon them, in great confu&s;ion, a general panic &s;eized the whole body of the &s;oldiery; and all attempts to rally them proved utterly inef|fectual. The general and all the officers exerted their utmo&s;t activity, to recover them from the uni|ver&s;al &s;urprize and di&s;order: but equally deaf were

they to intreaties and commands. During this &s;cene of confu&s;ion, they expended their ammuniti|on in the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t unmeaning fire. Some di&s;charging their pieces on our own parties, who were advanced from the main body for the recovery of the cannon. After three hours &s;pent in this me|lancholy &s;ituation, enduring a terrible &s;laughter, from (it may be &s;aid) an <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> foe, orders were given to &s;ound a retreat, that the men might be brought to cover the waggons. The&s;e they &s;ur|rounded but a &s;hort &s;pace of time: for the enemy's fire being again warmly renewed from the front and left flank, the whole army took to immediate flight; leaving behind them all the artillery, provi&s;ions, ammunition, baggage, military che&s;t, together with the general's cabinet, containing his in&s;truc|tions and other papers of con&s;equence. So great was the con&s;ternation of the &s;oldiers, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;top their career, flying with the ut|mo&s;t precipitation three miles from the field of action; where only one hundred began to make a more orderly retreat.</P>
<P>WHAT was the &s;trength of the enemy, has hither|to remained to us uncertain. According to Indian accounts, they exceeded not 400, chiefly Indians: and whether any were &s;lain, is &s;till to be doubted, for few were &s;een by our men, being covered by

Extreme|ly unfortunate was the whole &s;taff. The general, after having five hor&s;es &s;hot under him, received a wound in his lungs thro' his right arm, of which he died in four days. His &s;ecretary, elde&s;t &s;on of Major General Shirley, a gentleman of great ac|compli&s;hments, by a &s;hot thro' the head, was killed upon the &s;pot. Mr. Orme and Capt.

But, my Lord, how|ever cen&s;urable the conduct of the &s;oldiery may be thought, Mr. Braddock, too &s;anguine in his pro&s;|pects, was generally blamed for neglecting to cul|tivate the friend&s;hip of the Indians, who offered their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and who, it is certain, had a num|ber of them preceded the army, would have &s;ea|&s;onably di&s;covered the enemy's ambu&s;cade. The Virginian rangers al&s;o, in&s;tead of being made to &s;erve as regulars in the ranks with the Engli&s;h troops, &s;hould have been employed as out-&s;couts.

The provincials di&s;|contented with the inactivity of a long encamp|ment, Major General Lyman was obliged to make &s;hort marches to prevent their di&s;banding; and the general was therefore detained a while in that city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is detained at Albany.</NOTE>

to hinder &s;o fatal an event. His own troops in the mean time were filing off, in different divi&s;ions, from Schenectady towards O&s;wego.</P>
<P>OSWEGO, along the accu&s;tomed route,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Route to O&s;wego.</NOTE> is com|puted to be about 300 miles we&s;t from Albany. The fir&s;t &s;ixteen, to the village of Schenectady, is land carriage, in a good waggon road. From thence to the Little Falls, in the Mohawk River, at &s;ixty-five miles di&s;tance, the battoes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A battoe is a light flat-bottomed boat, wide&s;t in the mid|dle, and at each end &s;harp pointed, of about 1500 weight bur|den, and managed by two men, with paddles and &s;etting-poles.</NOTE> are &s;et a|gain&s;t a rapid &s;tream; which too, in dry &s;ea&s;ons, is &s;o &s;hallow, that the men are frequently obliged to turn out, and draw their craft over the rifts with inconceivable labour. At the Little Falls, the portage exceeds not a mile: the ground being mar&s;hy will admit of no wheel carriage, and there|fore the Germans who re&s;ide here, tran&s;port the battoes in &s;leds, which they keep for that purpo&s;e. The &s;ame conveyance is u&s;ed at the Great Carrying-Place, &s;ixty miles beyond the Little Falls; all the way to which the current is &s;till adver&s;e, and ex|tremely &s;wift. The portage here is longer or &s;hort|er, according to the dryne&s;s or wetne&s;s of the &s;ea|&s;ons. In the la&s;t &s;ummer months, when rains are not frequent, it is u&s;ually &s;ix or eight miles acro&s;s. Taking water again, we enter a narrow rivulet,
<PB N="54" REF="011701_0028_0F87EB89DEFAC170">
called the Wood-creek, which leads into the One|ida Lake, di&s;tant forty miles. This &s;tream, tho' favourable, being &s;hallow, and its banks covered with thick woods, was at this time much ob&s;truct|ed with old logs and fallen trees. The Oneida Lake &s;tretches from ea&s;t to we&s;t about thirty miles, and in calm weather is pa&s;&s;ed with great facility. At its we&s;tern extremity opens the Onondaga River, lead|ing down to O&s;wego, &s;ituated at its entrance on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Lake Ontario. Extremely difficult and hazardous is the pa&s;&s;age thro' this riv|er, as it abounds with rifts and rocks; and the cur|rent flowing with &s;urpri&s;ing rapidity. The principal ob&s;truction is twelve miles &s;hort of O&s;wego, and is a fall of about eleven feet perpendicular. The portage here is by land, not exceeding forty yards, before they launch for the la&s;t time.</P>
<P>YOUR LORDSHIP, from this account, will readi|ly conceive, that thro' &s;uch a long amphibious march an army mu&s;t proceed with prodigious ri&s;que and fatigue; and the battoes be nece&s;&s;arily con|ducted by per&s;ons &s;killed in the navagation, and en|ured to hard&s;hips. For this &s;ervice General Shirley had engagad all the young men in the county of Al|bany, who formerly had been employed in the Indi|an trade at O&s;wego: and a va&s;t number of battoes were prepared for the conveyance of the troops, &s;tores, and provi&s;ions.</P>

&s;ome unhand&s;om reflections upon his excel|lency; in&s;inuating, that to treat &s;eparately with them, he had employed one Lydius, a per&s;on of not the mo&s;t unexceptionable character, either for loyalty or integrity. The &s;ingle rea&s;on upon which the &s;urmi&s;e could be founded was this.

peace &mdash; that there &s;hould be no war there &mdash; and that he &s;hould not di&s;turb the French; adding, that he was going with the like me&s;&s;age to Canada. The general having convinced him, that the ex|pul&s;ion of the French from their encroachments mu&s;t redound to the advantage of the Six Nations; he a&s;&s;erted, that Mr. John&s;on had &s;ent them upon this emba&s;&s;y to Canada. Tho' this appeared ut|terly incredible, 'tis neverthele&s;s certain, 4, &s;eve|ral other Indians arrived from the Onondaga ca&s;tle, with a belt, declaring it to have been &s;ent them by Mr. John&s;on, with his reque&s;t, that not man of them would join the King's troops, under the com|mand of General Shirley. 5. Others al&s;o, from the Seneca, Oneida, and Cayuga cantons concur|red in the like reports; particularly one Redhead, an Indian of great fame, and a &s;peaker at the late congre&s;s at Mount-John&s;on, came to O&s;wego, in his way to O&s;wagatic or la Gallette, and de&s;ired the ce&s;&s;ation of all military de&s;igns; affirming, that with the &s;ame reque&s;t he was going to the French.</P>
<P>IT was with difficulty, my Lord, the&s;e Indians were reconciled to our attempts, detained at O&s;we|go, and thereby prevented from communicating our operations to the enemy.

fort at the landing, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's River, now called Fort Edward. About the latter end of the month, Gen. John&s;on, with the main body, moved forward 14 miles more northerly, and pitched his camp at the &s;outh end of Lake George, before called St. Sacrament. By &s;ome Indians, who had been &s;ent as &s;couts, he received the following advices: &mdash; That they had di&s;covered a party of French and Indians at Tinonderoge, &s;ituate on the i&s;thmus between the north end of Lake George and the &s;outhern part of Lake Champlain, 15 miles on this &s;ide Crown Point; but that no works were there thrown up. To have &s;ecured this pa&s;s, which commanded the route to Crown Point through the Lake, had been a mea&s;ure extremely advi&s;eable. Mr. John&s;on, informed of its importance, on the 1&s;t of September wrote to Gen.

Ju&s;t before he had made the ne|ce&s;&s;ary preparations, Montreal was alarmed with the news of our forming a numerous army near Lake St. Sacrament, for the reduction of Fort Frederic, and perhaps to penetrate into the heart of Canada.

St. Pierre, who had the chief command and influence over the Indians, mu&s;t have reduced them to le&s;s than 800. From the&s;e, one would have imagined, there was no danger of a &s;econd attack. Far more probable was it, that for &s;o momentous an enterprize as the reduction of the forts before-mentioned, the French had mu&s;tered all the forces they could &s;pare from Crown Point and Tinonderoge, where many of the regular troops were po&s;ted; e&s;pecially, as they went un|furni&s;hed with cannon. Add to this, that our ar|my was now flu&s;hed with victory; the enemy, on the contrary, di&s;concerted; and, according to his account, mo&s;t of their principal officers, and many of their men, &s;lain; the Indians too, by the death of St. Pierre, probably wavering and di&s;&s;ipated. This, if &s;uch were the facts, was a glorious op|portunity to di&s;po&s;e&s;s them of Tinonderoge.

And if they learnt he in|tended, in the pre&s;ent campaign, nothing beyond building a &s;tockaded fort, that very intelligence was &s;ufficient to induce them to attack the camp with cannon; again&s;t which, I am confident, his fort would make but a very indifferent re&s;i&s;tance.

<Q>Fortunate puer, tu nunc eris alter ab illo.</Q>
So capricious is fortune, and &s;o fond of &s;porting with human affairs.

<P>THESE are facts of inconte&s;tible notoriety:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why this action was &s;o greatly ex|aggerated</NOTE> and if your Lord&s;hip demands, whence then the ac|counts that &s;ix or eight hundered, nay a thou&s;and, fell before the camp (when, in reality, the enemy lo&s;t not above two hundered in all the three en|gagements, which is le&s;s than our own lo&s;s) there is no other way of accounting for the&s;e glaring mi&s;|repre&s;enrations, than that it &s;uited our pre&s;ent &s;y&s;|tem of politics to have this action exaggerated and magnified.

<P>NAY, to excu&s;e this favourite general, the blame of not following his advantage, has been thrown on Mr. Shirley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley ab|&s;urdly cen|&s;ured.</NOTE> and attributed to his po&s;itive di|rections. Be&s;ides the ab&s;urdity of the accu&s;ation, that he could be acce&s;&s;ary to an omi&s;&s;ion of this nature, it was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for him to know whether the enemy would at all ri&s;k an attack.

That this was the more probable, as O&s;wego was of the greate&s;t importance for &s;ecuring the frontiers of the we&s;tern colonies, maintaining the Briti&s;h do|minion over the great lakes, and the country be|yond the Apalachean mountains. He al&s;o took no|tice of the defencele&s;s &s;tate of O&s;wego, which would
<PB N="94" REF="011701_0048_0F87EB98DDFD5E40">
render it nece&s;&s;ary to leave a &s;trong garri&s;on there: that the number of effectives at that time in the three regiments and independent companies, in|cluding &s;erjeants and corporals, amounted to 1376; and that the irregulars, who were Albany men and Indians, procured by his own emi&s;&s;aries, con&s;i&s;ted only of 120. For the better &s;ecurity of the place, the general had ordered to be built, with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, a &s;trong wooden fort, capable of mount|ing cannon, with picquets and a ditch, on a high point, commanding the old fort on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river. This he ob&s;erved was already begun, and would &s;oon be compleated: and that for the propo&s;ed enterprize, he had built and equipped a &s;loop and &s;chooner of &s;ixty tons each, two row-gal|lies, each of twenty tons, with eight whale-boats, each capable of carrying &s;ixteen men. He then in|formed them of his intention to embark for Nia|gara, as &s;oon as the expected convoy arrived, with 600 regulars, including gunners and matro&s;&s;es, be|&s;ides the Albany and Indian irregulars, one 18 pounder, four 12 pounders, a ten-inch mortar, a &s;even-inch hoyet, two royals, and five &s;mall &s;wi|vel-hoyets, the ve&s;&s;els, whale-boats, and a compe|tent number of battoes; leaving behind him 700 effectives, two 12 pounders, ten 6 pounders, &s;ix 3 pounders, and eight cohorns.</P>

Holland, who had re&s;ided there above three years, declared it was commonly windy and wet, with few fair days intervening, during the fall. &mdash; That it was be&s;ides now impracticable for the ve&s;&s;els and battoes to &s;ail in concert: and as the ve&s;&s;els and whale-boats would not contain all the &s;upplies, there was the utmo&s;t danger of &s;poiling that part of the provi&s;ions and ammunition, which mu&s;t be conveyed in the battoes; in con&s;equence of which many of them might be cut off; it being more than probable, from the weakne&s;s of their fort, the ene|my would attack them on the lake &mdash; that from the returns of the director and &s;urgeons of the ho&s;pital, the number of the &s;ick amounted to about 300, ex|clu&s;ive

<P>THESE matters, my Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their opi|nion, and advice to lay a&s;ide the ex|pedition, and &s;trength|en O&s;wego.</NOTE> were attentively con|&s;idered: and the council of war prayed leave to add to the general's repre&s;entation &mdash; That Major Brad|&s;treet, &s;ince his re&s;idence there, was per&s;uaded 1650 Canadians had pa&s;&s;ed by from Cadaraqui to Niaga|ra, for the Ohio; a great part of whom, thro' &s;car|city of provi&s;ions, he conceived mu&s;t then be up|on their return to Canada; and that a con&s;iderable number of French traders go annually from Cana|da to Detroit, and other French &s;ettlements to the we&s;tward, who, at this &s;ea&s;on, are generally upon their return: &mdash; that their pa&s;&s;age home is by the way of Niagara, where, it is very probable, they and all the French will tarry, as long as their pro|vi&s;ions admit, for the defence of &s;o important a po&s;t. That there were then but few proper bat|toe-men at O&s;wego: nor could they be provided with a &s;ufficient number, as tho&s;e who under&s;tood the management of battoes were chiefly employed in the tran&s;portation of provi&s;ions from Schenecta|dy to O&s;wego, and from Albany to Lake George; and that the &s;oldiers were unable to conduct them

to Niagara, the lake being turbulant generally five days in &s;ix.</P>
<P>THE advice of the council, my Lord, was una|nimou&s;ly to this effect &mdash; That the arrival of the battoes with provi&s;ions, tho' hourly expected, was by no means to be depended upon, there being &s;calping-parties in the neighbourhood; one of which, &s;ince the la&s;t council of war, had actually killed three, and captivated two of the workmen employed in building the new fort on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river: and the cutting off the battoes was the more to be apprehended, as the Indians in our al|liance were now returning to their ca&s;tles. Nor did they think it advi&s;eable to ri&s;k the troops in battoes upon the lake, at &s;o advanced a &s;ea&s;on of the year. They approved his excellency's intention of rai&s;ing barracks for the &s;oldiers without delay; and thought the fort on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Onondaga River ought to be compleated as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and a|gain advi&s;ed the erection of a work for mounting cannon on the eminence we&s;t of the old fort &mdash; all which, in their opinion, could not be effected be|fore the winter was too far &s;et in, without employ|ing the whole &s;trength then at the place. They were al&s;o unanimou&s;ly and clearly of opinion, that his excellency ought to defer any attempt on Nia|gara or Frontenac, till the next &s;pring; when they

<P>THIS advice, my Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which was carried into execution.</NOTE> the general proceeded immediately to carry into execution. Compleating the fort on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, was a matter of principal attention, becau&s;e &s;ituated on a high point of land, at 100 yards di&s;tance from the lake, commanding the ground round about it &mdash; the old fort at 450 yards di&s;tance &mdash; and the entrance of the harbour. Its circumference was 800 feet, be|ing built of logs from 20 to 30 inches diameter, and the outer wall 14 feet high. Round it was to be a ditch 14 feet broad and 10 deep. Within, a &s;quare log-hou&s;e to overlook the walls, and barracks for 300 men. &mdash; This fort, called Ontario, was to mount 16 pieces of cannon. Another, called O&s;wego, was immediately begun, upon an eminence 450 yards we&s;t of the old fort. It was a &s;quare of 170 feet, with ba&s;tions, and a rampart of earth and ma&s;onry; which, be&s;ides the paraper, was to be 20 feet thick, 12 in height, with a ditch 14 feet broad and 10

deep. The barracks within were to contain 200 men. This was to mount eight pieces of cannon; being made the more defen&s;ible, as it commanded a good landing, di&s;tant 150 yards on the edge from the lake.</P>

<P>ALBANY, my Lord, is an old compact city, con|&s;i&s;ting of 3 or 400 well-built hou&s;es: and at about 16 miles N. W. from it, is the town of Schenecta|dy, con&s;i&s;ting of about 150 hou&s;es. The inhabitants are far from being indigent: the adjacent country abounds with provi&s;ions; and in &s;uch quarters, your Lord&s;hip is &s;en&s;ible, his Maje&s;ty's troops <HI>will</HI> not want nece&s;&s;aries; e&s;pecially <HI>fuel,</HI> in a country cover|ed with timber. Where then the probability, that the forces, which con&s;i&s;ted of 1200, would &s;uffer in a po&s;t like this? As to the affair of barracks, my Lord, there was a council held at New York, on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, when the news arrived of Col. Dunbar's retiring into winter-quarters, after Brad|dock's defeat. It was compo&s;ed of Mr. De Lancey the Lieut. Governor, Me&s;&s;. Alexander, Kennedy, Murray, Holland, Chambers, and Smith; and the opinion of that board then was, <Q>That not only the King's forces to the &s;outhward, but al&s;o tho&s;e that could be &s;pared from Nova Scotia, &s;hould quarter near Albany, for any future operations.</Q> This re&s;olve Mr. De Lancey tran&s;mitted to the ge|neral
<PB N="106" REF="011701_0054_0F87EB9D5DF5B550">
at O&s;wego; and as Dunbar's troops were or|dered to Albany, for the defence of that country, and particularly to make a &s;tand, in ca&s;e the pro|vincials were defeated; they had, methinks, the highe&s;t rea&s;on to expect favour from the inhabitants, and the &s;pecial countenance of the government, e|ven had they been quartered upon them as u&s;ual: and which at pre&s;ent is actually the ca&s;e, by expre&s;s orders of my Lord Loudon. The general, I &s;ay, had no rea&s;on to expect, upon this head, any op|po&s;ition from the civil magi&s;trate. But Sir Charles Hardy, on his arrival at Albany, about the 26th of September, &s;ignified to him by letter, his appre|hen&s;ions of unea&s;ine&s;s ari&s;ing among the inhabitants, &s;hould the &s;oldiers be quartered upon private fami|lies; and wi&s;hed to have his excellency's orders for building barracks, both there and at Schenectady; lea&s;t his a&s;&s;embly &s;hould not chu&s;e to put the pro|vince to that charge. He al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed his hopes, if &s;uch an expence was &s;aved them, of their greater readine&s;s to rai&s;e more men, &s;hould the &s;ervice re|quire it, the next campaign. The general's an&s;wer to this letter equally demon&s;trated his integrity to the crown, and concern for the troops. He inti|mated his fears, that the con&s;truction of barracks would be thought an extraordinary expence; but it being nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ervice, that Dunbar's,
<PB N="107" REF="011701_0054_0F87EB9D5DF5B550">
and the regiment of the late Sir Peter Halket, &s;hould winter in Albany and Schenectady, he com|plied with Sir Charles's reque&s;t; and de&s;ired him to provide barracks for tho&s;e regiments with all po&s;&s;ible dilligence, that the troops, on their arrival in his government, might not find them&s;elves de&s;|titute of quarters. To relieve the crown in the ex|pence, he farther took notice to Sir Charles, of the reque&s;t made by his own government for drawing the&s;e troops to Albany &mdash; that they would in a &s;pe|cial manner cover the frontier of New York &mdash; be of &s;ervice to O&s;wego in the en&s;uing &s;pring &mdash; and that the inhabitants would draw very large &s;ums from their re&s;idence among&s;t them. Nor did he for|get to recommend an imitation of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;&s;etts Bay; who thought it rea&s;onable to erect barracks for his own regiment, tho' they knew their conti|nuance among them would be &s;hort, de&s;tined as they were for the we&s;tern expedition. But that there might be no delay in building the barracks, ari&s;ing from any doubt of the expence being paid by the province of New York, Mr. Shirley inform|ed Sir Charles, that if they would not, after the&s;e con&s;iderations, take that expence on them&s;elves, he would defray it out of the contingent-money in the hands of the deputy pay-ma&s;ter. Thus, my Lord, if any ground for complaint of the want of
<PB N="108" REF="011701_0055_0F87EB9E1DF7B8F0">
barracks, Mr. Shirley 'tis clear was intirely uncen|&s;urable: and if the troops, as this libeller informs us, did &s;uffer in their tents, &mdash; I &s;ubmit it to your Lord&s;hip, who&s;e province it was to have found them better quarters. But the fact is, that the bar|racks were fini&s;hed, and the troops quartered in them before the fir&s;t of December, fuel provided for them &s;ufficient for the winter, and all at the expence of the crown.</P>
<P>THE winter now approaching, commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed by the governments concerned in the Crown Point expedition, to a&s;certain their re|&s;pective quotas for garri&s;oning the forts <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>William Henry,</HI> and di&s;banding the re&s;t of the army. After this was compleated, the general and Sir Charles Hardy returned to New York; where the former convened a grand congre&s;s of governors and field officers, to deliberate on a plan for the o|rations of the &s;ucceeding campaign. But before I enter upon their tran&s;actions, I &s;hall briefly lay be|fore your Lord&s;hip tho&s;e between Sir Charles Har|dy and his a&s;&s;embly; which was opened on the &s;e|cond, and continued &s;itting till the 23d of Decem|ber.</P>

The gentleman is a per&s;on of the fir&s;t figure in the&s;e colonies; and being acquainted with the &s;y&s;tem of politicks in New York, he informed Sir Danvers, that tho&s;e promi&s;es were by no means to be depended upon: that Mr. De Lancey was inex|pre&s;&s;ibly jealous of his a&s;cendancy over the a&s;&s;em|bly, who were utterly di&s;inclined to a perpetual &s;upport: that he would join in no mea&s;ures that might weaken the confidence they repo&s;ed in him: that as long as he maintained his influence in their coun&s;els, he would virtually be the governor of the province; and therefore upon the whole, his inte|re&s;t and ambition would infallibly lead him to keep every governor in a &s;tate of dependence upon him. Sir Danvers di&s;liked &s;o di&s;agreeable a prediction; and many are of opinion, that its accompli&s;hment

ha&s;tened his unhappy fate. Excu&s;e me, my Lord, for troubling you with a relation of facts, a little out of the &s;trict order of time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anecdote of Sir Danvers O&s;borne.</NOTE> There is an anec|dote of Sir Danvers, of which I would not have your Lord&s;hip uninformed. He arrived here on the 7th of October, 1753, under very di&s;couraging ap|prehen&s;ions of the people; and indeed not without rea&s;on, the oppo&s;ition again&s;t Mr. Clinton having been carried beyond all decorum. Governor O&s;|borne's commi&s;&s;ion, thro' Mr. Clinton's ab&s;cence, remained unpubli&s;hed till the third day after his arrival. This is u&s;ually done, fir&s;t privately in the council-chamber; and immediately after, in the mo&s;t public manner at the city-hall. To wait on his excellency thither, Mr. Clinton came abroad; an a&s;toni&s;hing crowd being a&s;&s;embled at the Fort Gate, to attend the proce&s;&s;ion. Mr. Clinton's ene|mies were very a&s;&s;iduous in exciting the popular acclamations; and the huzzas of the mob were &s;carce intermitted for a moment. There appeared, in &s;hort, &s;uch a profu&s;ion of joy, accompanied with &s;ome indecent expre&s;&s;ions re&s;pecting him&s;elf, as gave Mr. Clinton ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect more open indignities. He therefore &s;oon took his leave of Sir Danvers, who expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;plea&s;ure at the con|duct of his enemies. This, my Lord, proved a day of general fe&s;tivity and Bacchanalian frolic. In
<PB N="111" REF="011701_0056_0F87EB9EDDF426E0">
the evening, the city was illuminated: the com|mon blazed with bonfires: great was the con&s;ump|tion of Madiera; and every company rung with maledictions again&s;t the late commander in chief, who was charged as the &s;ole procurer of the new in&s;truction; an account of which could only have tran&s;pired from &s;ome of the council. Sir Danvers alone appeared unaffected with our intemperate re|vels; and on his countenance &s;at a melancholy gloom. He convened the council on Thur&s;day the eleventh of the month; and prayed their &s;entiments on the probability of obtaining a permanent &s;upport, according to his in&s;tructions. That the point was unattainable, they all delivered as their unanimous opinion. He then required the &s;olution of the &s;ame que&s;tion from each member &s;everally; and &s;till from each received the &s;ame reply. Upon this, he turn|ed him&s;elf about in apparant di&s;tre&s;s, uttered a deep &s;igh, and reclining his head again&s;t a window, in a de&s;ponding accent &s;aid, <Q>What then am I come hither for?</Q> The next morning &mdash; But I de&s;i&s;t. This in&s;truction, as your Lord&s;hip will be plea&s;ed to recollect, remained unrevoked all the time of his &s;ucee&s;&s;or: and 'tis natural to expect, that the people of this province were very inqui&s;i|tive whether it was continued to Governor Hardy &mdash; they were &s;o.

the general opened the conferrence, by laying be|fore the council the King's in&s;tructions to General Braddock.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The general delivers his &s;entiments to the council;</NOTE> He then delivered his &s;entiments to the board, to the following purpo&s;e: <Q>That our only enterance into Lake Ontario, was thro' the Onon|daga River to O&s;wego. No other harbour had his Maje&s;ty upon that lake, capable of receiving ve&s;&s;els of force: that O&s;wego was &s;ituate in the country of the Onondagas, the centre canton of the Six Nations, and famous for the furr trade no other mart could we boa&s;t, for commerce or corre&s;pondence with tho&s;e nu|merous tribes of &s;avages inhabiting the we&s;tern country, on the banks of the great lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, and the many rivers which roll into them: That the Lake Ontario was only acce&s;&s;ible to the Canadians, thro' the river Cada|racqui, formerly called by the French Fleuve I|roquois; but, in their late maps, calculated to countenance their exorbitant claims, di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the name of St. Lawrence. At the head of that river was their enterance into that lake; and near Fort Frontenac, &s;ituated on its north|ea&s;tern edge, about 50 miles, from, and nearly oppo&s;ite to, our fort at O&s;wego: That while the enemy kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Frontenac, with the harbour at Fronto, and a free pa&s;&s;age thro' the
<PB N="117" REF="011701_0059_0F87EBA11DF1B1F8">
Iroquois River, they would always be able to build and maintain ve&s;&s;els of force upon the lake: Thas his Maje&s;ty would therefore be nece&s;&s;itated to &s;upport a naval armament there, at lea&s;t equal to that of the French. Without this, they might annoy any forts we could erect at the northea&s;t end of the pa&s;s at Niagara; and O&s;wego it&s;elf be lo&s;t. The inevitable con&s;equence of which would be, the defection of the Six Nations, the lo&s;s of the whole country for near 300 miles from O&s;we|go to Schenectady, and perhaps the reduction of Albany it&s;elf.</Q> The general added, <Q>That all the French forts at Niagara, upon the lake Erie, and the river Ohio, tho&s;e al&s;o upon lake Huron, at the Streights of Mi&s;&s;ilimakinac, and the Lake Michigan &s;till more we&s;terly, received all their &s;upplies by water carriage from Montreal, thro' the River Iroquois, and the Lake Ontario: That the French &s;ettlements at the mouth of the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ippi furni&s;hed the&s;e northern garri&s;ons neither with provi&s;ions nor &s;tores; being not only at 2000 miles di&s;tance from any of them, but embarra&s;&s;ed with in&s;uperable difficulties, by a laborious na|vagation again&s;t a rapid &s;tream.</Q> Hence his ex|cellency concluded, <Q>That could the French be di&s;lodged from Frontenac and the little fort at Fronto, and their enterance into Lake Ontario

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and propo&s;es his plan of operations;</NOTE>IMPRESSED, my Lord, with the&s;e views, the ge|neral propo&s;ed, as a plan of operations for the next year &mdash; That 5000 men &s;hould be very early a&s;&s;em|bled at O&s;wego, and 4000 of them &s;ent to attack Frontenac and La Gallette; which being reduced, an attempt &s;hould be made upon the forts at Nia|gara, Pre&s;que I&s;le, Riviere au Beuf, Detroit, and Mi&s;&s;ilimakinac: and that in the mean time, 3000 provincial troops &s;hould march from Will's Creek, for the reduction of Fort Du Que&s;ne: that a body of 1000 &s;hould proceed to Crown Point, build a fort there, and launch one or more ve&s;&s;els into Lake Champlain: And that the force of Canada might be farther divided, he propo&s;ed, that 2000 men &s;hould carry fire and &s;word up Kennebec River, fall upon the &s;ettlements adjoining to the River Chandiere, and proceed to its mouth, three miles di&s;tant from Quebec; and by dividing them&s;elves into &s;mall parties along the banks of the river St. Lawrence, and de&s;troying the &s;cattered &s;ettlements there, keep that part of Canada in continual alarms.</P>
<P>HE then ob&s;erved, that if the &s;everal attempts upon Crown Point, the forts upon the lakes, and
<PB N="119" REF="011701_0060_0F87EBA1DDF8ED88">
the Ohio, were not pro&s;ecuted at the &s;ame time, very perilous might be the con&s;equences. That if in particular, while Frontenac and Niagara were attacked, no attempt was made again&s;t Crown Point, the whole force of Canada would march to oppo&s;e us; which would defeat the de&s;ign, and require &s;o large a body of troops, as to render the tran&s;porta|tion of nece&s;&s;aries to O&s;wego impracticable. So nu|merous an army might al&s;o march again&s;t Albany, as effectually to cut off the retreat of our forces, or at lea&s;t totally ob&s;truct their &s;upplies: That &s;hould, on the contrary, our whole &s;trength be de&s;tined for Crown Point, and the we&s;tern operations neglected; O&s;wego, the grand object of the French, was in the utmo&s;t danger of falling into their hands. A lo&s;s irreparable and beyond e&s;timation &mdash; the lo&s;s of the whole country down to Albany, with that of the Six confederate Nations; and to the French the acqui&s;ition of an ab&s;olute dominion on the lakes, and the whole &s;outhern country.</P>
<P>HIS EXCELLENCY fini&s;hed, with informing the council of his late intelligence &mdash; That the French were building three large ve&s;&s;els, of &s;uperior force to ours, in the harbour of Frontenac: and upon the whole prayed their advice.</P>

He earne&s;tly &s;ought an introduc|tion to General Braddock; and Mr. Shirley did the
<PB N="122" REF="011701_0062_0F87EBA35DF3EC48">
office with great politene&s;s. He was then ju&s;t in|formed of his appointment to be lieut. governor of New Jer&s;ey, and on that account pre&s;&s;ed for an ad|mi&s;&s;ion into the council. Mr. Shirley, in a very genteel manner, declined a ta&s;k, which might give offence to the general; and if any re&s;olution tran|&s;pired, draw him&s;elf into a &s;nare. But Mr. Pownal, being a &s;tranger to that diffidence and mode&s;ty, &s;o &s;uitable to his years and inexperience, became from this moment di&s;gu&s;ted, and was &s;eldom after &s;een among&s;t that gentleman's friends. He tarried at Philadelphia, till General Braddock's defeat: and towards autum returned to New York. This change of temper recommended him to Mr. De Lancey, who failed not to exa&s;perate the ri&s;ing re&s;entment: and now his oppo&s;ition became open and unre&s;erv|ed. Ju&s;t at this juncture, arrived Sir Charles Har|dy; and Mr. Shirley being then at O&s;wego, your Lord&s;hip &s;ees how &s;ea&s;onable their opportunity, for &s;owing the &s;eeds of prejudice in the brea&s;t of the new governor. I will not take upon me to &s;peak of their &s;ucce&s;s; but doubtle&s;s no mi&s;repre&s;entations were wanting to &s;trengthen the cabal. Yet no &s;ooner did the general arrive from O&s;wego at Albany, where Me&s;&s;. Pownal and De Lancey attended upon Sir Charles, than the former, di&s;&s;embling his en|mity, laboured to procure his confidence, that he
<PB N="123" REF="011701_0062_0F87EBA35DF3EC48">
might pry into his &s;ecrets: but from previous inti|mations of his pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition, in a letter to a gentleman then near the general, he failed in that in&s;idious de&s;ign. He could now no longer &s;uppre&s;s his malevolence, or conceal his recent connections; and therefore openly traduced the very man, to whom he was indebted for all his &s;ignificancy a|mong&s;t the provinces. My Lord, it is with reluc|tance I utter the&s;e things. But your Lord&s;hip is as determined to know every tran&s;action which con|cerns the operations in America, as I am to di&s;|charge the office of a faithful hi&s;torian. Truth is too &s;acred to be violated either out of fear or favour; and whatever your Lord&s;hip may think of this gen|tleman, &s;uch was his conduct. I knew him an a|vowed enemy to Mr. De Lancey, and to Mr. Shir|ey as &s;anguine a friend. I have &s;ince known him to calumniate the latter, and applaud the former. With a change of re&s;idence, or rather of intere&s;t, he changes &s;ides; and on this account, no man perhaps ever multiplied &s;o many adver&s;aries in &s;o &s;hort a time.

&s;uffer me, at this inactive &s;ea&s;on of the year, to en|tertain your Lord&s;hip with one or two in&s;tances of Lieut. Governor De Lancey's more private politi|cal feats.</P>
<P>NEVER was any man more impolitic than Go|vernor Clinton.

No|thing therefore, my Lord, could be more de&s;irable to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, than to hold that gentleman under proper re&s;traint. Sir Charles Hardy had this ad|vantage: his office of chief ju&s;tice, I am informed, became extingui&s;hed the moment the government devolved upon him by the death of Sir Danvers O&s;borne.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Philad. <DATE>21 Oct. 1755.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You &s;ay you're informed, that your lieut.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The opinion of a gentle|man of the law with re|&s;pect to it.</NOTE> go|vernor de&s;igns to exerci&s;e his former office, in virtue of the commi&s;&s;ion i&s;&s;ued by your late go|vernor Clinton. I can't think your information well grounded; becau&s;e I am clearly of opinion, that office was extingui&s;hed by his acceptance of the lieut. governor's commi&s;&s;ion: and I conceive Mr. De Lancey will hardly venture to di&s;pute the matter with, the crown. The main rea&s;on I go upon is, that tho&s;e two offices are incompa|tible. To make this plain to you, you mu&s;t un|der&s;tand &mdash; that to every office there are duties annexed. The &s;ame per&s;on cannot exerci&s;e two, offices, incon&s;i&s;tent with one another. One of
<PB N="132" REF="011701_0067_0F87EBA71DE70780">
them mu&s;t therefore be lo&s;t; becau&s;e as every office is <HI>pro bono publico,</HI> its u&s;e lies in the exer|ci&s;e of it: and the inferior office is that which is lo&s;t; becau&s;e it is mo&s;t for the public good, that the officer &s;hould hold the &s;uperior office; as the law pre&s;umes every man capable of the office, which the King, who is the fountain of offices and honour, is plea&s;ed to confer upon him. A|greeable to this, we find many re&s;olutions in our books: I'll mention one or two &mdash; A man cannot be fore&s;ter and judge <HI>eo in&s;tanti.</HI> Rolls Rep. 452, &amp;c. &mdash; Nor judge of the Com. and King's Bench <HI>&s;imul &amp; &s;emel.</HI> Dyer's Ca&s;e. 4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. the fir&s;t patent <HI>is determined,</HI> tho' the &s;econd was granted <HI>pro illa vice,</HI> and &s;urrendered the next day. Br. N C. 5 Mar. Br. Commi&s;&s;ions pl. 25.</P>
<P>NOTHING now remains but to &s;hew, that the office of chief ju&s;tice and governor of your pro|vince are incon&s;i&s;tent. To explain this, I mu&s;t inform you, that your &s;upreme court is a court of general juri&s;diction, e&s;tabli&s;hed by an ordinance of governor and council; claiming the like power here in all pleas civil and criminal, as fully as they are taken cognizance of by the King's Bench and Common Pleas in England. Superior to this, is the Court of Governor and Council &mdash; a court, in&s;tituted by one of his Ma|je&s;ty's
<PB N="133" REF="011701_0067_0F87EBA71DE70780">
in&s;tructions to your governor. In virtue of this in&s;truction, writs of error are returned from the &s;upreme court, before the governor and council. The incon&s;i&s;tency then of the two offices becomes very apparent: By the in&s;truc|tion, the governor in the court above is a <HI>&s;ine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> non;</HI> and to &s;uppo&s;e him at the &s;ame time judge in the court below, and mu&s;t di&s;regard the ab&s;urdity of the governor's &s;ending a writ to com|mand him&s;elf; and of his ju&s;tifying his judgment as chief ju&s;tice to him&s;elf in council as governor: and yet be excluded from a voice in the judg|ment above; which neverthele&s;s cannot be given without him. You &s;ee then the incompatibility is much &s;tronger, than if a man &s;hould be judge both of the King's and Common Bench in Eng|land. There the other judges of B. R. might cor|rect the error in the Common Pleas &mdash; but here the cour&s;e of public ju&s;tice might be intirely &s;topped.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be &s;aid, his power was only &s;u|&s;pended, while in the chair of government; I an|&s;wer with the ob&s;ervation before &mdash; that an office is a <HI>duty,</HI> as the very word it&s;elf implies: and I know of no &s;leeping and not-to-be-exerci&s;ed of|fice. Every office is in&s;tituted for the public good: the officer is therefore obliged to exerci&s;e
<PB N="134" REF="011701_0068_0F87EBA7DDE49680">
his duty; for, without that, he cannot &s;erve the public &mdash; and to be <HI>obliged to act,</HI> and at the &s;ame time <HI>obliged not to act,</HI> is non&s;en&s;e. It would be more &s;pecious to &s;ay, the in&s;truction is no law; as your a&s;&s;emblies have often &s;aid in other ca&s;es but then, Sir, Mr. De Lancey, in obedience to it, has declined acting as judge, ever &s;ince the death of Sir D. O&s;borne: and why has he (as I have been informed) rejected a writ of error, be|cau&s;e, according to this very in&s;truction, the da|mages in demand did not exceed 300 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling? Be&s;ides this court of Governor and Council, I am told, has long exerci&s;ed its power, under this and former in&s;tructions to your governors, of the like tenor, without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE offices will further appear to be incon&s;i&s;t|ent, if you reflect &mdash; that as governor he is al&s;o chancellor. The Court of Chancery often re|&s;trains the power of the law courts: and it is the &s;pirit of every court to enlarge its own juri&s;dic|tion. Upon both the&s;e accounts, the two offices mu&s;t inevitably cla&s;h. I know that Knevet was formerly chief ju&s;tice and chancellor: but the propriety of that double inve&s;titure was never &s;o|lemnly con&s;idered, it was long ago, in the time of Edw. III. There has been no in&s;tance of the like in latter times; nor do I believe it would be
<PB N="135" REF="011701_0068_0F87EBA7DDE49680">
&s;uffered. But the ca&s;e is much &s;tronger here &mdash; and I can't conceive, for the rea&s;ons above, that your lieut. governor will attempt to &s;it as judge, by virtue of his old commi&s;&s;ion. It it more pro|bable, he will prevail on your governor, lately arrived, to grant him a new patent.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>PERHAPS, my Lord, no higher evidence can be a&s;&s;igned of a man's influence, than &s;uch a bold in|va&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's prerogative. Mr. De Lancey was determined not to lo&s;e an office, which he knew to be the grand &s;ource of his popularity, and the main prop of his power. For, whoever is chief ju&s;|tice of the province, unle&s;s a very novice, mu&s;t be the &s;econd man in the government. Governor Hardy made no oppo&s;ition to this large Pride of ambition: and the other not long after, by his wonderful artifice, &s;ubjected him to his ab&s;olute dominion. It was effected in the following man|ner &mdash; Your Lord&s;hip will be plea&s;ed to recollect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lancey obliges the governor to pa&s;s two acts of a&s;&s;embly</NOTE> that Mr. De Lancey had the addre&s;s to prevail up|on the a&s;&s;embly to &s;end up a bill to the council, on the 4th of February, intituled, <Q>An act for the payment of the Debts due from this Co|lony; and other Purpo&s;es therein mentioned.</Q> By this, payments were to be made to many cre|ditors of the government, <HI>for &s;ervices done this colony,</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="011701_0069_0F87EBA89DE30428">
without &s;pecifying what tho&s;e &s;ervices were. The lieut. governor was to receive 3787 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 16 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> and &s;everal other &s;ums were payable to his brother. It was in reality a bill for di&s;charging the arrears due to the ordinary officers of the government. To ren|der it the more palatable to the governor, provi&s;ion was made for paying him al&s;o large &s;ums <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or pre|&s;ents to the Indians, and the expences of his voy|age to Albany, after the French repul&s;e at Lake George. When it came up to the council, it ob|tained a majority only by one voice: and of the&s;e, my Lord, two gentlemen, be&s;ides lieut gov. De Lancey, were them&s;elves intere&s;ted in the bill. They were the pui&s;ne judges of the &s;upreme court, Me&s;&s;. Hor&s;manden and Chambers, who&s;e arrears of &s;alary were now by the act to be di&s;charged. Me&s;&s;. Colden, Alexander, and Smith looked up|on it, as a mean inva&s;ion of the King's in&s;tructions, which, until they re&s;igned their &s;eats at the council board, they were bound in honour to regard with &s;acred punctuality. &mdash; It was be&s;ides evidently par|tial; no provi&s;ion being made for other creditors, who&s;e demands were indi&s;putable. They al&s;o con|ceived it derogatory to the dignity of that board, to pa&s;s an act, excluding them&s;elves from any knowledge of tho&s;e &s;ervices, for which the re&s;pec|tive &s;ums were made payable. For the&s;e rea&s;ons,
<PB N="137" REF="011701_0069_0F87EBA89DE30428">
among others, they oppo&s;ed the bill; and prayed their di&s;&s;ent might be entered, as a vindication of them&s;elves to his Maje&s;ty. The governor, to whom it was &s;ent up, detained it for farther con&s;ideration; tho' he pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal other bills on the 19th of the month. This circum&s;tance, my Lord, could not but chagrin his lieutenant, who had the bill much at heart; not only on account of the large &s;ums thereby payable to him&s;elf and brother; but becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;ing it into a law, would be the fulle&s;t evi|dence of his a&s;cendency over the governor; and if he could bring him into di&s;grace with the mini&s;try, by leading him into a breach of in&s;tructions. It was plain he would have nothing to rely upon, but his own popularity. This was an important card, and to be &s;kilfully played off. So indeed it was: and when I fini&s;h the &s;tory, I am per&s;uaded your Lord|&s;hip will entertain no very mean opinion of Ame|rican politicians. &mdash; The &s;pring was now advancing; and it became nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s a law far levying forces, not only to join the ea&s;tern colonies, on a new expedition again&s;t the French fortre&s;s at Crown Point, but for the protection of our we&s;tern fron|tiers, in conjunction with Penn&s;ylvania an&s;t New Jer&s;ey, which were become fields of blood, by the daily ravages of inhuman barbarians. The bill for this purpo&s;e originated with the a&s;&s;embly: and
<PB N="138" REF="011701_0070_0F87EBA95DE20E10">
Mr. De Lancey, who was now clo&s;eting the mem|bers, was its principal con&s;tructor. When it came before the council on the 28th of March, that board immediately objected to it, according to his expec|tations: and the governor declared, that if the council approved, he &s;hould him&s;elf give it a ne|gative. According to the tenor of this bill, the for|ces de&s;igned for the we&s;tern expedition were to &s;erve but forty days, when the province of New Jer&s;ey had ordained their quota, to be di&s;bandable by Mr. Belcher: and Sir Charles Hardy in&s;i&s;ted, that the like confidence ought to be repo&s;ed in his judge|ment. The two hou&s;es now engaged them&s;elves in a di&s;pute, at a time when, of all others, every con|tention &s;hould have been avoided. Mr. Oliver De Lancey, appointed by the hou&s;e to provide the &s;upplies for the regiment de&s;igned as our quota to|wards the Crown Point expedition, now gave or|ders to &s;top all farther preparations, an open rup|ture between the governor and a&s;&s;embly being daily expected. The members began freely to &s;peak a|gain&s;t him. The council laboured to procure an alteration of the bill &mdash; but all to no purpo&s;e. The principal thing aimed at, was the pa&s;&s;ing of the debt-bill: and a leading member in the hou&s;e plain|ly intimated their de&s;igns to the governor. Doubt|le&s;s your Lord&s;hip will wonder he did not di&s;&s;olve
<PB N="139" REF="011701_0070_0F87EBA95DE20E10">
them with indignation. Believe me, my Lord, it would have been a &s;tep, at this time, extremely unadvi&s;eable. Forty days intermi&s;&s;ion between the te&s;t and return of the writ of &s;ummons for the elec|tion of repre&s;entatives, being required by law; the public exigencies were too pre&s;&s;ing to admit of any delay. Mr. De Lancey knew all his advantages: and that Sir Charles Hardy might be at no lo&s;s to conjecture that the hou&s;e was now acting at his beck, nor him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of joining with the council again&s;t the bill, ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the con&s;ultations of that board. The neigh|bouring colonies in the mean time were urging the di&s;patch of our preparations for opening the campaign.

<P>Mr. Shirley laid before them the minutes of the congre&s;s in December,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and ac|quaints them with the &s;i|tuation of affairs.</NOTE> and acquainted them with the &s;tate of affairs. With re&s;pect to the we&s;tern expedition, the naval &s;orce upon the lake con&s;i&s;ted, he ob&s;erved, of two ve&s;&s;els of ten carriage-guns each; two row-gallies, each of ten &s;wivels; and that he had three months before i&s;&s;ued orders for building three other ve&s;&s;els, one of eighteen, ano|ther
<PB N="142" REF="011701_0072_0F87EBAADDE774E0">
of &s;ixteen, and a third of 12 carriage-guns. Be&s;ides which, there would be 250 whale-boats up|on the lake, each of them capable of containing 16 men. The land forces then at O&s;wego, and on their march for pre&s;erving a free communication between that place and Albany, were his own and Peppe|rell's regiments, with that rai&s;ed and &s;upported by the province of New Jer&s;ey, and the four independ|ent companies of New York. As there was a maga|zine of provi&s;ions and &s;tores at the Canajohary Falls, about 35 miles from Schenectady; his excellency propo&s;ed po&s;ting there 100 men out of tho&s;e forces: as many more at the German Flats, to &s;ecure ano|ther magazine, guard the portage, and convoy the provi&s;ions thro' the Wood Creek: and as the fall near O&s;wego occa&s;ioned another &s;mall portage, a fort was there al&s;o to be erected, for a garri&s;on of fifty men at lea&s;t. It was, my Lord, of the great|e&s;t moment to keep open the communication be|tween Albany and our fort on the lake; his excel|lency was therefore intent upon rai&s;ing four com|panies of &s;ixty privates each, to be employed in &s;couting along the pa&s;&s;age, and harra&s;&s;ing the French &s;ettlements between Frontenac and Montreal.</P>
<P>THE general gave them al&s;o an account of the &s;trength of O&s;wego, when he left it the la&s;t fall &mdash; adding, that he had &s;ent up Mr. M'Keller, the en|gineer

in &s;econd, and Mr. Sower, a practitioner engineer, with orders to make &s;uch additional works, as they &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecu|rity of that important po&s;t. And your Lord&s;hip will be plea&s;ed to take notice, that the&s;e orders were i&s;&s;ued very early in March, before the Mohawk ri|ver was open; and that the engineers actually ar|rived at O&s;wego in April. At the&s;e &s;everal garri|&s;ons were to be depo&s;ited &s;ix months provi&s;ions for 7000; and he ob&s;erved to the council, that for that purpo&s;e, 200 whale-boats and 500 battoes had been di&s;patched from the fir&s;t of April &s;ince Schenectady. The remaining quantity would have been tran&s;|&s;ported by the middle of July, had his de&s;igns been carried into execution.</P>
<P>As to the provincial expedition, he informed them &mdash; that the troops voted by the &s;everal colo|nies amounted to 8800 men, including the officers and garri&s;ons at the forts Edward and William-Hen|ry. One, or perhaps two hundred Indians might be expected to join them, be&s;ides a company which his excellency had rai&s;ed to harra&s;s the enemy upon Lake Champlain, and procure intelligence of their motions in Canada; and three more, for the like &s;ervice, were intended to be cho&s;en out of the whole force de&s;tined for Crown Point.</P>

capt. of a ranging company, gave repeated demon|&s;trations of his activity in the neighbourhood of Crown Point. He made many incur&s;ions upon the enemy, fell on their &s;cattered parties, and &s;carce e|ver returned to Fort William-Henry, without &s;calps and pri&s;oners. The general took a particular notice of him; and he became &s;ingularly &s;erviceable in pro|curing intelligence. By a cadet whom he took on the 20th of May, we were informed, that the whole number of men at Fort St. Frederic, Tinonderoge, and at an advanced po&s;t, were 1100, compo&s;ed of the regiments of Languedoc, the Queen's regiment, two companies of the colony troops, and the militia. Be|&s;ides the&s;e, there were Indians; but their numbers uncertain: that at Tinonderoge the French had twelve pieces of ordnance mounted, and carriages preparing for an additional number; but that the retrenchment at at the advanced po&s;t was without any cannon. The&s;e troops wintered at Montreal and Chambly; and arrived at the &s;outh end of the lake about the middle of April, being plentifully &s;upplied with provi&s;ions and military &s;tores.&mdash;The&s;e intelli|gences the general laid before his council; and then ob&s;erved, that the 50th and 51&s;t regiments, the four independent companies, and the regiment of New Jer&s;ey, were &s;carce a third part of the number of troops de&s;igned by the general plan for the operations upon
<PB N="145" REF="011701_0073_0F87EBAB9DDCC680">
Lake Ontario: that the provincials were al&s;o not on|ly deficient of the complement thought nece&s;&s;ary at the congre&s;s, but even of the number voted by the provinces concerned in the enterprize again&s;t Crown Point; and that it was impracticable, even with the junction of the 44th and 48th regiments, then at Albany, to carry on both the northern and we&s;tern expeditions at the &s;ame time: that he had no de|pendance upon the Indians of the Six Nations; Sir William John&s;on being unable to procure &s;couting parties; and that upon this account he propo&s;ed rai&s;ing four companies for that &s;ervice.</P>
<P>YOUR Lord&s;hip may hence ob&s;erve, what rea&s;on the congre&s;s in December had for their opinion, that more troops were nece&s;&s;ary for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice in America. No reinforcements being yet arrived from England, for carrying the general plan into execution, the council were of unanimous opinion &mdash; that 1300 ought to be po&s;ted at O&s;wego,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their opi|nion and ad|vice.</NOTE> 50 at the Falls, 200 at the Oneida Carrying-Place, 150 at the German Flatts, and as many more at the Conejo|hary Falls. They advi&s;ed therefore, &mdash; that the 50th and 51&s;t, and the New Jer&s;ey regiments, the inde|pendents, and the North Carolina provincials (all which amounted to about 2000 men) &s;hould be em|ployed in that &s;ervice. The 44th and 48th regiments, with the colony troops, were thought &s;ediment to re|duce

Accordingly, they recommend|ed their junction: advi&s;ing, however, that the re|gulars &s;hould continue for a time in their encamp|ment, at Albany. &mdash; The ranging companies, pro|po&s;ed by the general, were highly approved; and the rai&s;ing of others &s;trongly recommended.

The former was a depo&s;it for &s;tores, and at the concurrence of all the routes from Crown Point to Albany. The latter would command the route taken by baron Die&s;kau for his de&s;igned attack upon Fort Edward &mdash; a route thro' which in|cur&s;ions were frequently made upon our northern frontier. A fort at the South Bay was conceived re|qui&s;ite, to cover our convoys of provi&s;ions for the northern expedition from the in&s;ults of the enemy, who in flying parties infe&s;ted the pa&s;&s;age from Al|bany to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the building of a &s;ort at South Bay, preparations were making when Mr. Shirley re&s;igned the command of the army: but the work has &s;ince been neglected; and the pa&s;&s;age from Fort Edward to our camp at William-Henry, infe&s;ted all this &s;um|mer, and many of our people cut off, as was fore&s;een by this council.</NOTE> William-Henry.

were the very &s;entiments which the general repeat|edly communicated to Sir William John&s;on, in his letters, after the action at Lake George; which were then &s;lighted by the cabal, who &s;tudiou&s;ly oppo&s;ed him in all his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>THUS I have &s;hewen your Lord&s;hip the rea&s;ons why the general plan continued to be unexecuted, till the &s;itting of this la&s;t council of war. Mr. Shir|ley, however, in hopes of the arrival of the expect|ed reinforcements, and loth to be diverted from his favourite de&s;igns upon Lake Ontario, continued to throw large quantities of provi&s;ions and &s;tores into Schenectady, and all the magazines between that place and O&s;wego. This, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, was done to induce his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, from the&s;e ample &s;upplies, to act upon this quarter; it being univer&s;ally ima|gined, that Crown Point was now become the main object of the mini&s;try. Till the arrival of General Webb on the 7th of June, this was only conjecture, and general report. The effects of the mi&s;repre|&s;entations of American affairs in England, then be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">came evident to all; for the &s;tores laid in at Sche|nectady were now reconveyed to Albany for the northern expedition; and fre&s;h clamours excited a|gain&s;t Mr. Shirley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Major Ge|neral Aber|crombie takes the command of the army.</NOTE> for his &s;upplies towards the we&s;tern operations.

The&s;e were put under the direction of capt. Brad&s;treet, an active vigilent offi|cer, inured to the hard&s;hips to which that &s;ervice ineviteably expo&s;ed him. This, tho' one of the mo&s;t judicious mea&s;ures that could have been taken, was made the &s;ubject of low invective. The faction at New York laboured to repre&s;ent it as a project to involve the Crown in a needle&s;s expence: but time has given the fulle&s;t evidence of the propriety of this &s;tep; and <HI>proper</HI> it will appear to your Lord|&s;hip, before the conclu&s;ion of this letter. General Shirley wi&s;ely for&s;aw, that the Indians of the Six Na|tions, whatever influence over them Sir William John&s;on might pretend, could not be engaged e|ven to protect the King's troops in the pa&s;&s;age thro' their own country; and that unle&s;s the communi|cation was kept open to O&s;wego, nothing could be effected upon, the Lake, nor the garri&s;on it&s;elf pre|&s;erved from falling into the hands of the enemy. Accordingly, no &s;ooner did the &s;pring open,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;mall po&s;t cut off in the Indian coun|try.</NOTE> than a little blockaded po&s;t, with 25 men, at the Carry|ing-Place, in the very center of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> country, was cut off; the Oneidas them&s;elves being unque&s;|tionably

concerned in the ma&s;&s;acre. Nothing could &s;ecure us again&s;t the repetition of the&s;e in&s;ults, but pa&s;&s;ing thro' the country with large &s;quadrons of battoes: and to facilitate the tran&s;portation, Mr. Shirley, who canva&s;ed every expedient for the pre|&s;ervation of O&s;wego, employed a working party of 80 men, under a director, to remove the ob&s;truc|tions in the Wood Creek; by this means, the por|tage from the Mohawks River, acro&s;s the great Car|rying-Place, was reduced from eight miles to one. Nor did he omit ob&s;erving to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, that an attempt upon Niagara was of the la&s;t importance; the lo&s;s or pre&s;ervation of our Indians depending up|on the &s;ucce&s;s of the operations on Lake Ontario.</P>
<P>RELATIVE to the Crown Point expedition, he re|commended the march of part of the army, in a new di&s;covered route, on the we&s;t &s;ide of Lake George, to the enemy's advanced works, five miles &s;hort of Tinonderoge. Which being carried, the heavy ar|tillery and &s;tores might be there landed, and tran&s;|ported thro' a road to Tinonderoge and Fort Fre|deric: and after the reduction of tho&s;e Fortre&s;&s;es, he advi&s;ed General Abercrombie immediately to con&s;truct armed ve&s;&s;els, to &s;ecure the command of Lake Champlain.</P>

<P>BEFORE Mr. Shirley left O&s;wego the la&s;t year, he
<PB N="152" REF="011701_0077_0F87EBAE9DD66998">
propo&s;ed to the Six Nations, their convening this &s;ummer, in a grand council there, the Indians on the north &s;ide of Lake Ontario, and round Lake Erie, to con&s;ult their common intere&s;t, and main|tain a corre&s;pondence by annual councils at O&s;we|go. And to draw off the latter from their attach|ment to the French, recommended to the Six Na|tions their concurrence, in opening a free trade with the foreign Indians, at the entrance of the O|nondaga river, upon terms more advantageous to all the Indians, than any hitherto pur&s;ued. This &s;pring Sir William John&s;on informed his excellen|cy, that the Six Nations were extremely well plea&s;|ed with the projects relating both to the trade at O&s;wego, and the con&s;truction of forts in their can|tons.

<P>EQUALLY unpromi&s;ing was the &s;ituation of our

affairs with the &s;outhern Indians. Some hopes in|deed were entertained of the fidelity of the Chero|kees &mdash; a people warlike and powerful; in who&s;e territories the Virginians were erecting a fortre&s;s. The Shawane&s;e neverthele&s;s continued their irrup|tions into that province: and Governor Dinwiddie was obliged to draft the militia, to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s, and pre&s;erve the town of Winche&s;ter. The&s;e Indians al&s;o, with the Su&s;quehanas and De|lawares, committed frequent ho&s;tilities upon the Penn&s;ylvanians. Governor Morris, for the protec|tion of the country, carried a line of forts on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Kittatiny mountains, all along the extended frontier of that colony, from Delaware to the river Potowmac. The government of New Jer|&s;ey proceeded even to declare war again&s;t the De|laware Indians; and would have penetrated into their &s;ettlements, had not a&s;&s;urances been &s;ent by Sir William John&s;on from the council at Ononda|ga, that the Delawares and Shawane&s;e, in obedience to the Six Nations, were under renewed and po&s;itive engagements, to refrain from any farther outrages upon the &s;outhern frontiers. If any &s;uch promi&s;es were really made, 'tis certain they were immediately broken, many of our inhabitants having &s;ince been murdered and captivated by the &s;avages of tho&s;e very tribes. Whence we may fairly conclude, that
<PB N="154" REF="011701_0078_0F87EBAF5DE09710">
either the Six Nations connived at the&s;e infractions of their commands; or that their antient &s;overeign|ty is become the contempt of their tributaries. In fact, my Lord, the matter is &s;till wor&s;e. Too much rea&s;on is there to believe the truth of both the&s;e al|ternatives.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir William John&s;on's conduct con&s;idered.</NOTE>I INFORMED your Lord&s;hip, that Sir William John&s;on was ordered to proceed from Onondaga to O&s;wego, with as many Indians as could be per&s;uad|ed to march with him; not only for the more ef|fectual pre&s;ervation of that po&s;t, but to execute the plan which Gen. Shirley had concerted, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an annual council there, with tho&s;e Indians who had been long in the French intere&s;t, and &s;eemed ready to li&s;ten to propo&s;als for an alli|ance with us.

Be&s;ides the de&s;truction of our po&s;t in the very country of the Oneidas mentioned before, the enemy infe&s;ted the parts about O&s;wego, and the whole pa&s;&s;age thi|ther, without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition from the Six Na|tions. Alarms indeed were frequently given of the approach of their flying parties; and it was ob&s;erv|able, that Sir William John&s;on, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, as Colonel of the county, rai&s;ed the militia of Alba|ny, and proceeded to the &s;pot; tho' every man ac|quainted with Indians well knows, that of all places, the&s;e are the mo&s;t unlikely for finding the enemy. By &s;uch &s;ham expeditions have our northern inha|bitants been impoveri&s;hed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed: nor could they an&s;wer any other end, than to rai&s;e a bruit thro' the colonies; and with parade and o&s;tentation &s;et the gazetteers upon &s;ounding his applau&s;e. &mdash; Even in the&s;e wild romantic excur&s;ions, but few Indians attended him: and yet if we credit our news writ|ers, hundreds were in his train.</P>

that his very enemies recollected their un|grounded calumnies with &s;hame and confu&s;ion. &mdash; I allude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of a gallant action of our battoe men under Capt. Brad&s;treet.</NOTE> my Lord, to the action between the French and our battoe-men, on the 3d of July. Sen&s;ible of the importance of O&s;wego, the enemy collected them&s;elves about the latter end of May in a large body, not many miles to the ea&s;tward of that gar|ri&s;on; from whence detachments were perpetually &s;ent out to fall upon our workmen, and infe&s;t the pa&s;&s;age thro' the Onondaga River. Capt. Brad&s;treet' who had the direction of the battoes, was apprized that &s;mall parties lay in ambu&s;h, waiting a favour|able opportunity to attack him. Accordingly, when he left O&s;wego, he ordered the &s;everal divi&s;ions to proceed as near each other as po&s;&s;ible: but &s;o nu|merous and irregular a body could not without dif|ficulty be kept to any tolerable order. He was at the head of about 300 battoe-men, in the fir&s;t divi|&s;ion, upon his return to Schenectady; and about nine miles from O&s;wego, when the energy, who were 700 &s;trong, ro&s;e from their ambu&s;cade, and fired upon his front. Near the place of attack, was a &s;mall i&s;land, by which the enemy might ea&s;ily have ford|ed the river. Brad&s;treet in an in&s;tant landed upon the i&s;land, to prevent being inclo&s;ed between two fires; and with &s;ix men maintained his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, bravely repelling twenty of the enemy, who attempt|ed
<PB N="157" REF="011701_0079_0F87EBB01DD83E58">
to &s;eize that advantageous po&s;t. He was than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> inforced with &s;ix others; and even compelled a &s;e|cond party of 40 French to give way. Enraged at this &s;hameful di&s;appointment, the enemy, to the number of 70 men, thought proper to make a third attempt; but the battoe-men, who did not exceed 20, with redoubled bravery &s;till kept their ground, and again forced their adver&s;aries to retire. During the&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes, which la&s;ted near an hour, the bat|toe-men in the rear landed, without lo&s;s or confu|&s;ion, upon the &s;outh &s;ide of the river. Four hun|dred of the enemy now advanced up the north &s;ide of the &s;tream, intending to ford it about a mile higher, and &s;urround us. Brad&s;treet, aware of the de&s;ign, left the i&s;land, and with 200 men marched on the other &s;ide to oppo&s;e them. But they had ac|tually forded over, before he came up, and po&s;ted them&s;elves in a &s;wamp. Dr. Kirkland, with the &s;e|cond divi&s;ion of battoes, was now advancing to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but Brad&s;treet ordered him, and Capt. Butler, who commanded the third divi&s;ion, to keep their po&s;ts, and cover the battoes in the rear. Be|ing arrived at the &s;wamp, an engagement en&s;ued in the Indian manner of fighting, and continued above an hour with dubious &s;ucce&s;s. Brad&s;treet, at length animating his men, ru&s;hed into the thicket thro' twice his number, and gallantly pu&s;hed them into
<PB N="158" REF="011701_0080_0F87EBB0DDD688D8">
the river, where many of them peri&s;hed. Another attempt was made, in the mean time, to ford the river a little higher; but tho&s;e being al&s;o repul&s;ed, the whole party was intirely routed and di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>JUST after the defeat, Capt. Patten, with his gre|nadiers from Onondaga, fell in with our battoes; and the next morning a reinforcement of 200 men came up from the garri&s;on: and but for the exce&s;|&s;ive rains, which began &s;oon after the action, and continued all the next day, the&s;e brave battoe-men would probably have cut off the whole party. Had Sir William John&s;on, as was expected, accompani|ed Capt. Patten to O&s;wego, with the Indians from Onondaga, Brad&s;treet might have made immediate pur&s;uit, and many of the enemy mu&s;t have been overtaken: but this pacific plenipotentiary was then ha&s;tening to Albany (a &s;afer &s;ituation) with the im|portant minutes of his late conference. A confer|ence full of affectionate Indian &s;peeches, and large promi&s;es of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; when &s;carce a man of them could be prevailed upon to turn out of his hut for the defence of the common cau&s;e. Brad&s;treet had but three Indians of the Six Nations with him at this attack. Of the&s;e, one took to his heels; a &s;econd fought bravely; but the third went over to the enemy, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in pointing out our officers. In the&s;e &s;everal actions we had about 30 men killed
<PB N="159" REF="011701_0080_0F87EBB0DDD688D8">
and wounded. How many of the French were &s;lain, is not certainly known; tho' it is generally &s;aid, they lo&s;t about 120. Eighty arms were brought to Schenectady; and about 70 men found in the woods, and carried to O&s;wego. The French fled in the ut|mo&s;t di&s;order: and &s;ome of their regular &s;oldiers, being &s;trangers to the country, got bewildered in the de&s;art, and peri&s;hed for want of &s;u&s;tenance.</P>

In a &s;cheme &s;o de|ci&s;ive, and in no other, will the provinces heartily unite; and if well concerted, and our unfortified &s;ea-coa&s;ts at the &s;ame time &s;ufficiently protected; it will doubtle&s;s &s;ucceed &mdash; humble the pride of France &mdash; and clo&s;e the pre&s;ent war with a la&s;ting and honourable peace. I am,</P>
