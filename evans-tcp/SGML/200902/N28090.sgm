<HEAD>THE PREFACE BEING A SUMMARY ACCOUNT OF THE DIVERS DISPENSATIONS OF GOD TO MEN, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD TO THAT OF OUR PRESENT AGE, BY THE MINISTRY AND TESTIMONY OF HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT GEORGE FOX, AS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENSUING JOURNAL.</HEAD>
<P>DIVERS have been the di&s;pen&s;ations of God &s;ince the creation of the world, unto the &s;ons of men; but the great end of all of them has been the renown of his own excellent name in the creation and re&s;toration of man: man, the emblem of him&s;elf, as a god on earth, and the glory of all his works. The world began with innocency: all was then good that the good God had made: and as he ble&s;&s;ed the works of his hands, &s;o their natures and har|mony magnified him their Creator. Then the morning &s;tars &s;ang together for joy, and all parts of his works &s;aid Amen to his law. Not a jarr in the whole frame, but man in paradi&s;e, the bea&s;ts in the field, the fowl in the air, the fi&s;h in the &s;ea, the lights in the heavens, the fruits of the earth; yea the air, the earth, the water and fire wor&s;hipped, prai&s;ed and exalted his power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. O holy &s;abbath, O holy day to the Lord!</P>
<P>But this happy &s;tate la&s;ted not long: for man, the crown and glory of the whole, being tempted to a&s;pire above his place, unhappily yielded again&s;t command and duty, as well as intere&s;t and felicity; and &s;o fell below it, lo&s;t the divine image, the wi&s;dom, power, and purity he was made in. By which, being no longer fit for paradi&s;e, he was ex|pelled that garden of God, his proper dwelling and re&s;idence,
<PB N="iv" REF="037441_0003_100D8D63EA044960">and was driven out, as a poor vagabond, from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, to wander in the earth, the habitation of bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Yet God, that made him, had pity on him; for he &s;eeing he was deceived, and that it was not of malice, or an original pre&s;umption in him, but through the &s;ubtilty of the &s;erpent (that had fir&s;t fallen from his own &s;tate, and by the mediation of the woman, man's own nature and companion, whom the &s;erpent had fir&s;t deluded) in his in|finite goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom found out a way to repair the breach, recover the lo&s;s, and re&s;tore fallen man again by a nobler and more excellent Adam, promi&s;ed to be born of a woman; that as by means of a woman the evil one had prevailed upon man, by a woman al&s;o He &s;hould come into the world, who would prevail again&s;t him, and brui&s;e his head, and deliver man from his power: and which, in a &s;ignal manner, by the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Son of God in the fle&s;h, in the fulne&s;s of time, was per&s;onally and fully accompli&s;hed by him, and in him, as man's Saviour and Redeemer.</P>
<P>But his power was not limited, in the manife&s;tation of it, to that time; for both before and &s;ince his ble&s;&s;ed mani|fe&s;tation in the fle&s;h, he has been the light and life, the rock and &s;trength of all that ever feared God: pre&s;ent with them in their temptations, followed them in their travels and af|flictions, and &s;upported and carried them through and over the difficulties that have attended them in their earthly pil|grimage. By this, Abel's heart excelled Cain's, and Seth obtained the pre-eminence, and Enoch walked with God. It was this that &s;trove with the old world, and which they rebelled again&s;t, and which &s;anctified and in&s;tructed Noah to Salvation.</P>
<P>But the outward di&s;pen&s;ation that followed the benighted &s;tate of man, after his fall, e&s;pecially among the patriarchs, was generally that of angels; as the &s;criptures of the Old Te&s;tament do in many places expre&s;s, as to Abraham, Ja|cob, &amp;c. The next was that of the law by Mo&s;es, which was al&s;o delivered by angels, as the apo&s;tle tells us. This di&s;pen&s;ation was much outward, and &s;uited to a low and &s;ervile &s;tate; called therefore that of a &s;choolma&s;ter, to point out and prepare that people to look and long for the Me&s;&s;iah, who would deliver them from the &s;ervitude of a ceremonious and imperfect di&s;pen&s;ation, by knowing the realities of tho&s;e my&s;terious repre&s;entations in them&s;elves. In this time the law was written on &s;tone, the temple built with hands, at|tended
<PB N="v" REF="037441_0004_100D8D65E618A3C8">with an outward prie&s;thood and external rites and ceremonies, that were &s;hadows of the good things that were to come, and were only to &s;erve till the Seed came, or the more excellent and general manife&s;tation of Chri&s;t, to whom was the promi&s;e, and to all men only in him, in whom it was Yea and Amen; even life from death, immortality and eternal life.</P>
<P>This the prophets fore&s;aw, and comforted the believing Jews in the certainty of it; which was the top of the Mo|&s;aical di&s;pen&s;ation, and which ended in John's mini&s;try, the forerunner of the Me&s;&s;iah, as John's was fini&s;hed in him, the fulne&s;s of all. And God, that at &s;undry times and in divers manners had &s;poken to the fathers by his &s;ervants the prophets, &s;pake then by his Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us, <Q>who is heir of all things;</Q> being the go&s;pel-day, which is the di&s;pen&s;ation of &s;on&s;hip: bringing in thereby a nearer te&s;ta|ment, and a better hope, even the beginning of the glory of the latter days, and of the re&s;titution of all things; yea, the re&s;toration of the kingdom unto I&s;rael.</P>
<P>Now the Spirit, that was more &s;paringly communicated in former di&s;pen&s;ations, began to be <Q>poured forth upon all fle&s;h,</Q> according to the prophet Joel, and the light that &s;hined in darkne&s;s, or but dimly before, the mo&s;t gra|cious God cau&s;ed to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, and the day-&s;tar began to ari&s;e in the hearts of believers, giving unto them the knowledge of God in the face (or appearance) of his Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Now the poor in &s;pirit, the meek, the true mourners, the hungry and thir&s;ty after righteou&s;ne&s;s, the peace-makers, the pure in heart, the merciful and the per&s;ecuted, came more e&s;pecially in remembrance before the Lord, and were &s;ought out and ble&s;&s;ed by I&s;rael's true Shepherd. Old Jeru&s;alem with her children grew out of date, and the new Jeru&s;alem into reque&s;t, the mother of the &s;ons of the go&s;pel-day. Wherefore no more at old Jeru&s;alem, nor at the mountain of Samaria, will God be wor&s;hipped above other places; for, behold, he is declared and preached a Spirit, and he will be known as &s;uch, and wor&s;hipped in the Spirit and in the Truth. He will come nearer than of old time, and he will write his law in the heart, and put his fear and Spi|rit in the inward parts, according to his promi&s;e. Then &s;igns, types, and &s;hadows flew away, the day having di&s;co|vered their in&s;ufficiency in not reaching to the in&s;ide of the cup, to the clean&s;ing of the con&s;cience; and all element|ary
<PB N="vi" REF="037441_0005_100D8D67B3D71E40">&s;ervices were expired in and by him that is the &s;ub|&s;tance of all.</P>
<P>And to this great and ble&s;&s;ed end of the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Son of God, did the apo&s;tles te&s;tify, whom he had cho|&s;en and anointed by his Spirit, to turn the Jews from their prejudice and &s;uper&s;tition, and the Gentiles from their vanity and idolatry, to Chri&s;t's Light and Spirit that &s;hined in them; that they might be quickened from the &s;ins and tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es in which they were dead, to &s;erve the Living God in the newne&s;s of the Spirit of Life, and walk as children of the light, and of the day, even the day of holine&s;s: for &s;uch "put on Chri&s;t," the light of the world, <Q>and make no more provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, to fulfil the lu&s;ts thereof.</Q> So that the Light, Spirit, and Grace that comes by Chri&s;t, and appears in man, was what the apo&s;tles mini&s;tered from, and turned people's minds unto, and in which they ga|thered and built up the churches of Chri&s;t in their day. For which cau&s;e they advi&s;ed them not to quench the Spirit, but wait for the Spirit, and &s;peak by the Spirit, and pray by the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit too, as that which approved them the truly begotten children of God, <Q>born not of fle&s;h and blood, nor of the will of man, but of the will of God;</Q> by doing his will, and denying their own; by drinking of Chri&s;t's cup, and being baptized with his bapti&s;m of &s;elf-denial: the way and path that all the heirs of life have trod to ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. But alas! even in the apo&s;tles days (tho&s;e bright &s;tars of the fir&s;t magnitude of the go&s;pel-light) &s;ome clouds (foretelling an eclip&s;e of this pri|mitive glory) began to appear, and &s;everal of them gave early caution of it to the chri&s;tians of their time; that even then there was, and yet would be more and more, a falling away from the power of godline&s;s, and the purity of that &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation, by &s;uch as thought to make a fair &s;hew in the fle&s;h, but with whom the offence of the cro&s;s cea&s;ed: yet with this comfortable conclu&s;ion, that they &s;aw beyond it a more glorious time than ever, to the true church. Their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight was true, and what they foretold to the churches, ga|thered by them in the name and power of Je&s;us, came &s;o to pa&s;s: for chri&s;tians degenerated apace into out&s;ides, as days, and meats, and divers other ceremonies. And which was wor&s;e, they &s;ell into &s;trife and contention about them, &s;eparating one from another, then envying, and, as they had power, per&s;ecuting one another, to the &s;hame and &s;can|dal of their common chri&s;tianity, and grievous &s;tumbling
<PB N="vii" REF="037441_0006_100D8D6AA2812CF8">and offence of the heathen, among whom the Lord had &s;o long and &s;o marvellou&s;ly pre&s;erved them. And having got at la&s;t the worldly power into their hands, by kings and emperors embracing the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, they changed what they could the kingdom of Chri&s;t, which is not of this world, into a worldly kingdom; or at lea&s;t &s;tiled the world|ly kingdom that was in their hands the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and &s;o they became worldly, and not true chri&s;tians. Then human inventions and novelties, both in doctrine and wor|&s;hip, crowded fa&s;t into the church, a door being opened thereunto by the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and carnality that appeared then among the generality of chri&s;tians; who had long &s;ince left the guidance of God's meek and heavenly Spirit, and given them&s;elves up to &s;uper&s;tition, will-wor&s;hip, and voluntary humility. And as &s;uper&s;tition is blind, &s;o it is heady and furious; for all mu&s;t &s;toop to its blind and boundle&s;s zeal, or peri&s;h by it: in the name of the Spirit, per&s;ecuting the very appearance of the Spirit of God in others, and oppo|&s;ing that in them which they re&s;i&s;ted in them&s;elves, viz. the Light, Grace, and Spirit of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but always under the notion of innovation, here&s;y, &s;chi&s;m, or &s;ome &s;uch plau&s;ible name. Though chri&s;tianity allows of no name or pretence whatever for per&s;ecuting of any man for matters of mere religion; religion being in its very nature meek, gentle, and forbearing; and con&s;i&s;ts of faith, hope, and charity, which no per&s;ecutor can have, whil&s;t he re|mains a per&s;ecutor; in that a man cannot believe well, or hope well, or have a charitable or tender regard to another, whil&s;t he would violate his mind or per&s;ecute his body for matters of faith or wor&s;hip towards his God.</P>
<P>Thus the fal&s;e church &s;prang up, and mounted the chair. But though &s;he lo&s;t her nature, &s;he would keep her good name of the Lamb's bride, the true church and mother of the faithful; con&s;training all to receive her mark, either in their forehead or right-hand, publickly or privately: but in deed and in truth &s;he was My&s;tery Babylon, the mother of harlots: mother of tho&s;e that with all their &s;how and out&s;ide of religion, were adulterated and gone from the Spi|rit, nature, and life of Chri&s;t, and grown vain, worldly, ambitious, covetous, cruel, &amp;c. which are the fruits of the fle&s;h, and not of the Spirit.</P>
<P>Now it was that the true church fled into the wilderne&s;s, that is, from &s;uper&s;tition and violence to a retired, &s;olitary, and lonely &s;tate; hidden and as it were out of &s;ight of men,
<PB N="viii" REF="037441_0007_100D8D6C367BE810">tho' not out of the world: which &s;hews that her wonted vi&s;ibility was not e&s;&s;ential to the being of a true church in the judgment of the Holy Gho&s;t; &s;he being as true a church in the wilderne&s;s, though not as vi&s;ible and lu&s;trous, as when &s;he was in her former &s;plendor of profe&s;&s;ion. In this &s;tate many attempts &s;he made to return, but the waters were yet too high, and her way blocked up, and many of her excellent children in &s;everal nations and centuries fell by the cruelty of &s;uper&s;tition, becau&s;e they would not fall from their faithfulne&s;s to the truth.</P>
<P>The la&s;t age did &s;et &s;ome &s;teps towards it, both as to doctrine, wor&s;hip, and practice. But practice quickly fail|ed, for wickedne&s;s flowed in a little time, as well among the profe&s;&s;ors of the reformation, as tho&s;e they reformed from; &s;o that by the fruits of conver&s;ation they were not to be di&s;|tingui&s;hed. And the children of the reformers, if not the reformers them&s;elves, betook them&s;elves very early to earthly policy and power to uphold and carry on their reformation that had been begun with &s;piritual weapons; which I have often thought has been one of the greate&s;t rea&s;ons the re|formation made no better progre&s;s, as to the life and &s;oul of religion: for whil&s;t the reformers were lowly and &s;pi|ritually-minded, and tru&s;ted in God, and looked to Him, and lived in his fear, and con&s;ulted not with fle&s;h and blood, nor &s;ought deliverance in their own way, there were daily added to the church &s;uch as, one might rea&s;onably &s;ay, &s;hould be &s;aved. For they were not &s;o careful to be &s;afe from per&s;ecution, as to be faithful under it.</P>
<P>Being more concerned to &s;pread the truth by their faith and patience in tribulation, than to get the worldly pow|er out of their hands that inflicted their &s;ufferings upon them; and it will be well, if the Lord &s;uffer them not to fall by the very &s;ame way they took to &s;tand. In doctrine they were in &s;ome things &s;hort; in other things, to avoid one extreme, they ran into another: and for wor&s;hip, there was for the generality more of man than God. They owned the Spirit, in&s;piration and revelation indeed, and grounded their &s;eparation and reformation upon the &s;en&s;e and under|&s;tanding they received from it, in the reading of the &s;crip|tures of Truth; and this was their plea, The Scripture was the text, the Spirit the interpreter, and that to every one for him&s;elf. But yet there was too much of human invention, tradition and art, that remained both in praying and preach|ing, and of worldly authority and worldly greatne&s;s in their
<PB N="ix" REF="037441_0008_100D8D6DCEDC1F78">mini&s;ters, e&s;pecially in this kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, and &s;ome parts of Germany. God was therefore plea&s;ed, among us, to &s;hift from ve&s;&s;el to ve&s;&s;el: and the next remove hum|bled the mini&s;try, &s;o that they were more &s;trict in preach|ing, devout in praying, and zealous for keeping the Lord's day, and catechi&s;ing of children and &s;ervants, and repeating at home in their families what they had heard in publick.</P>
<P>But even as the&s;e grew into power, they were not only for whipping &s;ome out, but others into the temple: and they appeared rigid in their &s;pirits, rather than &s;evere in their lives, and more for a party, than for piety: which brought forth another people, that were yet more retired and &s;elect. They would not communicate at large, or in common with others; but formed churches among them&s;elves of &s;uch as could give &s;ome account of their conver&s;ion at lea&s;t, of very promi&s;ing experiences of the work of God's grace upon their hearts, and under mutual agreements and covenants of fel|low&s;hip they kept together. The&s;e people were &s;omewhat of a &s;ofter temper, and &s;eemed to recommend religion by the charms of its love, mercy, and goodne&s;s, rather than by the terrors of its judgments and puni&s;hment; by which the former party would have terrified people into Religion.</P>
<P>They al&s;o allowed greater liberty to prophecy than tho&s;e before them; for they admitted any member to &s;peak or pray, as well as their pa&s;tor (whom they always cho&s;e, and not the civil magi&s;trate). If &s;uch found any thing pre&s;&s;ing upon them to either duty, even without the di&s;tinction of clergy or laity; per&s;ons of any trade, be it never &s;o low and mechanical. But alas! even the&s;e people &s;uffered great lo&s;s. for ta&s;ting of worldly empire, and the favour of princes, and the gain that en&s;ued, they degenerated but too much. For though they had cried down national churches, and mini&s;|try and maintenance too, &s;ome of them, when it was their own turn to be tried, fell under the weight of worldly ho|nour and advantage, got into profitable par&s;onages too much, and outlived and contradicted their own principles: and, which was yet wor&s;e, turned &s;ome of them ab&s;olute per&s;ecutors of other men for God's &s;ake, that but &s;o lately came them&s;elves out of the furnace; which drove many a &s;tep farther, and that was into the water. Another bapti&s;m, as believing they were not &s;cripturally bapti&s;ed; and hoping to find that pre&s;ence and power of God, in &s;ubmitting to that ordinance, which they de&s;ired and wanted.</P>
<P>The&s;e people made al&s;o profe&s;&s;ion of neglecting, if not
<PB N="x" REF="037441_0009_100D8D6FBA6EA9F8">renouncing and cen&s;uring, not only the nece&s;&s;ity, but u&s;e of all human learning, as to the mini&s;try; and all other qualifications to it, be&s;ides the helps and gifts of the Spirit of God, and tho&s;e natural and common to men; and for a time they &s;eemed, like John of old, a burning and a &s;hining light, to other &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>They were very diligent, plain and &s;erious, &s;trong in &s;cripture, and bold in profe&s;&s;ion, bearing much reproach and contradiction: but that which others fell by proved their hurt. For worldly power &s;poiled them too; who had enough of it to try them, what they would do if they had more; and they re&s;ted al&s;o too much upon their watery di&s;|pen&s;ation, in&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing on more fully to the Fire and Holy Gho&s;t, which was his bapti&s;m who came with a <Q>fan in his hand, that he might throughly (and not in part only) purge his floor,</Q> and take away the dro&s;s and the tin of his people, and make a man finer than gold. Withal, they grew high, rough, and &s;elf-righteous, oppo&s;ing further attainment; too much forgetting the day of their infancy and littlene&s;s, which gave them &s;omething of a real beauty; in|&s;omuch that many left them, and all vi&s;ible churches and &s;ocieties. and wandered up and down as &s;heep without a &s;hepherd, and as doves without their mates; &s;eeking their beloved, but could not find him, as their &s;ouls de&s;ired to know him; whom their &s;ouls loved above their chiefe&s;t joy.</P>
<P>The&s;e people were called Seekers by &s;ome, and the Fa|mily of Love by others; becau&s;e, as they came to the know|ledge of one another, they &s;ometimes met together, not for|mally to pray or preach, at appointed times and places, in their own wills, as in times pa&s;t they were accu&s;tomed to do; but waited together in &s;ilence, and as any thing ro&s;e in any one of their minds, that they thought &s;avoured of a divine &s;pring, &s;o they &s;ometimes &s;poke. But &s;o it was, that &s;ome of them not keeping in humility, and in the fear of God. af|ter the abundance of revelation, were exalted above mea&s;ure, and for want of &s;taying their minds in an humble depend|ance upon him that opened their under&s;tandings to &s;ee great things in his law, they run out in their own imaginations, and mixing them with tho&s;e divine openings, brought &s;orth a mon&s;trous birth, to the &s;candal of tho&s;e that feared God, and waited daily in the temple. not made with hands, for the con&s;olation of I&s;rael; the Jew inward, and Circumci&s;ion in &s;pirit.</P>
<P>This people obtained the name of Ranters from their ex|travagant
<PB N="xi" REF="037441_0010_100D8D71C3649378">di&s;cour&s;es and practices. For they interpreted Chri&s;t's fulfilling of the law for us, to be a di&s;charging of us from any obligation and duty the law required, in&s;tead of the condemnation of the law for &s;ins pa&s;t, upon faith and re|pentance, and that now it was no &s;in to do that which before it was a &s;in to commit; the &s;lavi&s;h fear of the law being ta|ken off by Chri&s;t, and all things good that man did, if he did but do them with the mind and per&s;ua&s;ion that it was &s;o. In&s;omuch that divers fell into gro&s;s and enormous practices; pretending in excu&s;e thereof, that they could, without evil, commit the &s;ame act which was &s;in in another to do; there|by di&s;tingui&s;hing between the action and the evil of it, by the direction of the mind and intention in the doing of it. Which was to make &s;in &s;uper-abound by the aboundings of grace, and to turn from the grace of God into wantonne&s;s, a &s;ecurer way of &s;inning than before: as if Chri&s;t came not to take away &s;in, but that we might &s;in more freely at his co&s;t, and with le&s;s danger to our&s;elves. I &s;ay, this en&s;nared divers, and brought them to an utter and lamentable lo&s;s, as to their eternal &s;tate; and they grew very trouble&s;ome to the better &s;ort of people, and furni&s;hed the loo&s;er with an occa&s;ion to prophane.</P>
<P>It was about that very &s;ame time, as you may &s;ee in the en&s;uing annals, that the eternal, wi&s;e, and good God was plea&s;ed, in his infinite love, to honour and vi&s;it this benight|ed and bewildered nation with his glorious day-&s;pring from on high; yea with a mo&s;t &s;ure and certain &s;ound of the word of light and life, through the te&s;timony of a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el, to an effectual and ble&s;&s;ed purpo&s;e, can many thou&s;ands &s;ay, "Glory be to the name of the Lord for ever."</P>
<P>For as it reached the con&s;cience, and broke the heart, and brought many to a &s;en&s;e and &s;earch; &s;o what people had been vainly &s;eeking without, with much pains and co&s;t, they by this mini&s;try found within; where it was they wanted what they &s;ought for, viz. the right way to peace with God. For they were directed to the light of Je&s;us Chri&s;t within them, as the Seed and Leaven of the kingdom of God; near all, becau&s;e in all, and God's talent to all. A faithful and true witne&s;s and ju&s;t monitor in every bo&s;om. The gift and grace of God to life and &s;alvation, that appears to all, though few regard it. This, the traditional chri&s;tian. con|ceited of him&s;elf, and &s;trong in his own will and righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and overcome with blind zeal and pa&s;&s;ion, either de&s;|pi&s;ed as a low and common thing, or oppo&s;ed as a novelty,
<PB N="xii" REF="037441_0011_100D8D745E58C898">under many hard names and opprobrious terms; denying, in his ignorant and angry mind, any fre&s;h manife&s;tation of God's power and Spirit in man in the&s;e days, though never more needed to make true chri&s;tians: not u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">like tho&s;e Jews of old, that rejected the Son of God at the very &s;ame time that they blindly profe&s;&s;ed to wait for the Me&s;&s;iah to come; becau&s;e, alas, he appeared not among them according to their carnal mind and expectation.</P>
<P>This brought forth many abu&s;ive books, which filled the greater &s;ort with envy, and le&s;&s;er with rage, and made the way and progre&s;s of this ble&s;&s;ed te&s;timony &s;trait and nar|row indeed to tho&s;e that received it. However, God owned his own work, and this te&s;timony did effectually reach, ga|ther, comfort, and e&s;tabli&s;h the weary and heavy laden, the hungry and thir&s;ty, the poor and needy, the mournful and &s;ick of many maladies, that had &s;pent all upon phy&s;icians of no value, and waited for relief from heaven, help only from above: &s;eeing, upon a &s;erious trial of all things, nothing el&s;e would do but Chri&s;t him&s;elf, the light of his counte|nance, a touch of his garment, and help from his hand, who cured the poor woman's i&s;&s;ue, rai&s;ed the centurion's &s;ervant, the widow's &s;on, the ruler's daughter, and Peter's mother, and, like her they no &s;ooner felt his power and efficacy upon their &s;ouls, but they gave up to obey him in a te&s;ti|mony to his power, and with re&s;igned wills and faithful hearts, through all mockings, contradictions, beatings, pri|&s;ons, and many other jeopardies that attended them for his ble&s;&s;ed name's &s;ake.</P>
<P>And truly, they were very many and very great; &s;o that in all human probability they mu&s;t have been &s;wallowed up quick of the proud and boi&s;terous waves that &s;welled and beat again&s;t them; but that the God of all their tender mer|cies was with them in his glorious authority, &s;o that the hills often fled, and the mountains melted before the power that filled them; working mightily for them, as well as in them, one ever following the other. By which they &s;aw plainly, to their exceeding great confirmation and comfort, <Q>that all things were po&s;&s;ible with him with whom they had to do.</Q> And that the more that which God required &s;eemed to cro&s;s man's wi&s;dom, and expo&s;e, them to man's wrath, the more God appeared to help and carry them through all to his glory: in&s;omuch that if ever any people could &s;ay in truth, <Q>Thou art our &s;un and our &s;hield, our rock and &s;anctuary, and by thee we have leaped over a
<PB N="xiii" REF="037441_0012_100D8D75F7AEB708">wall, and by thee we have run through a troop, and by thee we have put the armies of the aliens to flight,</Q> the&s;e people had right to &s;ay it. And as God had delivered their &s;ouls of the weari&s;ome burthens of &s;in and vanity, and en|riched their poverty of &s;pirit, and &s;atisfied their great hunger and thir&s;t after eternal righteou&s;ne&s;s, and filled them with the good things of his own hou&s;e, and made them &s;tewards of his manifold gifts; &s;o they went forth to all quarters of the&s;e nations, to declare to the inhabitants thereof, what God had done for them; what they had found, and where and how they had found it; viz. the way to peace with God: invit|ing them to come and &s;ee and ta&s;te for them&s;elves, the truth of what they declared unto them.</P>
<P>And as their te&s;timony was to the principle of God in man, the precious pearl and leaven of the kingdom, as the only ble&s;&s;ed means appointed of God to quicken, convince, and &s;anctify man; &s;o they opened to them what it was in it|&s;elf, and what it was given to them for: how they might know it from their own &s;pirit, and that of the &s;ubtil appear|ance of the evil one, and what it would do for all tho&s;e, who&s;e minds are turned off from the vanity of the world, and its lifele&s;s ways and teachers, and adhere to this ble&s;&s;ed light in them&s;elves, which di&s;covers and condemns &s;in in all its appearances, and &s;hews how to overcome it, if minded and obeyed in its holy manife&s;tations and convictions: giv|ing power to &s;uch to avoid and re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e things that do not plea&s;e God, and to grow &s;trong in love, faith, and good works: that &s;o man, whom &s;in hath made as a wilderne&s;s, over-run with briars and thorns, might become as the gar|den of God, cultivated by his divine power, and repleni&s;hed with the mo&s;t virtuous and beautiful plants of God's own right-hand planting, to his eternal prai&s;e.</P>
<P>But the&s;e experimental preachers of glad tidings of God's truth and kingdom could not run when they lift, or pray or preach when they plea&s;ed, but as Chri&s;t their Redeemer prepared and moved them by his own ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, for which they waited in their &s;ervices and meetings, and &s;poke as that gave them utterance, and which was as tho&s;e having authority, and not like the dreaming, dry, and formal Pha|ri&s;ees. And &s;o it plainly appeared to the &s;erious-minded, who&s;e &s;piritual eye the Lord Je&s;us had in any mea&s;ure open|ed; &s;o that to one was given the word of exhortation, to another the word of reproof, to another the word of con&s;o|lation,
<PB N="xiv" REF="037441_0013_100D8D780B521DF8">and all by the &s;ame Spirit and in the good order thereof, to the convincing and edifying of many.</P>
<P>And truly they waxed &s;trong and bold through faithful|ne&s;s; and by the power and Spirit of the Lord Je&s;us became very fruitful; thou&s;ands, in a &s;hort time, being turned to the truth through their te&s;timony in mini&s;try and &s;ufferings, in&s;omuch as in mo&s;t counties, and many of the con&s;iderable towns of England, meetings were &s;ettled, and daily there were added &s;uch as &s;hould be &s;aved. For they were diligent to plant and to water, and the Lord ble&s;&s;ed their labours with an exceeding great increa&s;e, notwith&s;tanding all the op|po&s;ition made to their ble&s;&s;ed progre&s;s, by fal&s;e rumours, calumnies, and bitter per&s;ecutions; not only from the pow|ers of the earth, but from every one that li&s;ted to injure and abu&s;e them: &s;o that they &s;eemed indeed to be as poor &s;heep appointed to the &s;laughter, and as a people killed all the day long.</P>
<P>It were fitter for a volume than a preface, but &s;o much as to repeat the contents of their cruel &s;ufferings from profe&s;|&s;ors as well as from prophane, and from magi&s;trates as well as the rabble; &s;o that it may well be &s;aid of this abu&s;ed and de&s;pi&s;ed people, they went forth weeping, and &s;owed in tears, bearing te&s;timony to the precious &s;eed, the &s;eed of the kingdom, which &s;tands not in words, the fine&s;t, the highe&s;t that man's wit can u&s;e, but in power; the power of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to whom God the Father hath given all power in heaven and in earth, that he might rule angels above, and men below; who impowered them, as their work witne&s;&s;eth, by the many that were turned through their mini&s;try from darkne&s;s to the light, and out of the broad into the narrow way, bringing people to a weighty, &s;erious, and godly con|ver&s;ation; the practice of that doctrine which they taught.</P>
<P>And as without this &s;ecret divine power there is no quick|ening and regenerating of dead &s;ouls, &s;o the want of this ge|nerating and begetting power and life is the cau&s;e of the lit|tle fruit that the many mini&s;tries that have been, and are in the world bring forth. O that both mini&s;ters and people were &s;en&s;ible of this! My &s;oul is often troubled for them, and &s;orrow and mourning compa&s;s me about for their &s;akes. O that they were wi&s;e! O that they would con&s;ider and lay to heart the things that truly and &s;ub&s;tantially make for their la&s;ting peace!</P>
<P>Two things are to be briefly touched upon, the doctrine they taught, and the example they led among all people. I
<PB N="xv" REF="037441_0014_100D8D7A81B001C0">have already touched upon their fundamental principle, which is as the corner &s;tone of their fabrick: and to &s;peak eminently and properly, their characteri&s;tick, or main di|&s;tingui&s;hing point or principle, viz. the light of Chri&s;t with|in, as God's gift for man's &s;alvation. This, I &s;ay, is as the root of the goodly tree of doctrines that grew and branched out from it, which I &s;hall now mention in their natural and experimental order.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, repentance from dead works to &s;erve the living God. Which comprehends three operations. Fir&s;t, A &s;ight of &s;in. Secondly, A &s;en&s;e and godly &s;orrow for it. Thirdly, An amendment for the time to come. This was the repent|ance they preached and pre&s;&s;ed, and a natural re&s;ult from the principle they turned all people unto. For of light came &s;ight; and of &s;ight came &s;en&s;e and &s;orrow; and of &s;en&s;e and &s;orrow, came amendment of life: which doctrine of repent|ance leads to ju&s;tification; that is, forgivene&s;s of the &s;ins that are pa&s;t through Chri&s;t, the alone propitiation; and the &s;anc|tification or purgation of the &s;oul from the defiling nature and habits of &s;in pre&s;ent; which is ju&s;tification in the complete &s;en&s;e of that word; comprehending both ju&s;tification from the guild of the &s;ins that are pa&s;t, as if they had never been cominitted, through the love and mercy of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and the creature's being made inwardly ju&s;t through the clean&s;ing and &s;anctifying power and Spirit of Chri&s;t re|vealed in the &s;oul; which is commonly called &s;anctification.</P>
<P>From hence &s;prang a &s;econd doctrine they were led to de|clare, as the mark of the prize of the high calling of all true Chri&s;tians, viz. perfection from &s;in, according to the &s;crip|tures of truth, which te&s;tify it to be the end of Chri&s;t's com|ing, and the nature of his kingdom, and for which his Spi|rit was given. But they never held a perfection in wi&s;dom and glory in this life, or from natural infirmities or death, as &s;ome have with a weak or ill mind imagined and in&s;inuated again&s;t them.</P>
<P>This they called a redeemed &s;tate, regeneration, or the new birth: teaching every where according to their foundation, that without this work were known, there was no inheriting the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Third, to an acknowledgement of eternal rewards and puni&s;hment, as they have good rea&s;on; for el&s;e of all peo|ple, certainly they mu&s;t be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable: who for about forty years have been exceeding great &s;ufferers for their pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="xvi" REF="037441_0015_100D8D7C88359000">and in &s;ome ca&s;es treated wor&s;e than the wor&s;t of men, yea as the refu&s;e and off-&s;couring of all things.</P>
<P>This was the purport of their doctrine and mini&s;try; which, for the mo&s;t part, is what other profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity pre|tend to hold in words and forms, but not in the power of god|line&s;s; that has been long lo&s;t by mens departing from that principle and &s;eed of life that is in man, and which man has not regarded, but lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of, and in and by which he can only be quickened in his mind to &s;erve the living God in newne&s;s of life. For as the life of religion was lo&s;t, and the generality lived and wor&s;hipped God after their own wills, and not after the will of God, nor the mind of Chri&s;t, which &s;tood in the works and fruits of the Holy Spirit; &s;o that which they pre&s;&s;ed was not notion but experience, nor for|mality but godline&s;s; as being &s;en&s;ible in them&s;elves, through the work of God's righteous judgments, that with|out holine&s;s no man &s;hould ever &s;ee the Lord with comfort.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e doctrines, and out of them, as the larger branches, there &s;prang forth &s;everal particular doctrines, that did exemplify and further explain the truth and efficacy of the general doctrine before ob&s;erved in their lives and exam|ples. As,</P>
<P N="1">I. Communion and loving one another. This is a noted mark in the mouth of all &s;orts of people concerning them. "They will meet, they will help and &s;tick one to another." Whence it is common to hear &s;ome &s;ay, <Q>Look how the Quakers love and take care of one another.</Q> Others le&s;s moderate will &s;ay, "The Quakers love none but them&s;elves;" and if loving one another, and haying an intimate commu|nion in religion, and con&s;tant care to meet to wor&s;hip God and help one another, be any mark of primitive chri&s;tianity, they had it, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, in an ample manner.</P>
<P N="2">II. To love enemies: this they both taught and prac|ti&s;ed: for they did not only refu&s;e to be revenged for injuries done them, and condemned it as of an unchri&s;tian &s;pirit, but they did freely forgive, yea help and relieve, tho&s;e that had been cruel to them, when it was in their power to have been even with them; of which many and &s;ingular in&s;tances might be given: endeavouring, through patience, to overcome all inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, and preaching this doctrine as chri&s;tian for others to follow.</P>
<P N="3">III. The &s;ufficiency of truth-&s;peaking, according to Chri&s;t's own form of words, of yea, yea, and nay, nay, a|mong chri&s;tians, without Wearing, both from Chri&s;t's ex|pre&s;s
<PB N="xvii" REF="037441_0016_100D8D7E7B1AA938">prohibition to "&s;wear at all," Mat. v. and for that they being under the tie and bond of truth in them&s;elves, there was both no nece&s;&s;ity for an oath, and it would be a reproach to their chri&s;tian veracity to a&s;&s;ure their truth by &s;uch an ex|traordinary way of &s;peaking: but offering at the &s;ame time to be puni&s;hed to the full for fal&s;e &s;peaking, as others for perjury, if ever guilty of it; and hereby they exclude, with all true, all fal&s;e and profane &s;wearing; for which the land did and doth mourn, and the great God was and is not a lit|tle offended with it.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Not fighting but &s;uffering is another te&s;timony pe|culiar to this people: they affirm that Chri&s;tianity teacheth people <Q>to beat their &s;words into plough-&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning hooks, and to learn war no more, that &s;o the wolf may lie down with the lamb, and the lion with the calf, and nothing that de&s;troys be entertained in the hearts of people;</Q> exhorting them to employ their zeal again&s;t &s;in, and turn their anger again&s;t &s;atan, and no longer war one again&s;t another; becau&s;e all wars and fightings come of mens own hearts lu&s;ts, according to the apo&s;tle James, and not of the meek Spirit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who is captain of another warfare, and which is carried on with other weapons. Thus, as truth-&s;peaking &s;ucceeded &s;wearing, &s;o faith and truth &s;ucceeded fighting, in the doctrine and practice of this people. Nor ought they for this to be obnoxious to civil government, &s;ince if they cannot fight for it, neither can they fight again&s;t it; which is no mean &s;ecurity to the &s;tate: nor is it rea&s;onable that people &s;hould be blamed for not do|ing more for others than they can do for them&s;elves. And Chri&s;tianity &s;et a&s;ide, if the co&s;ts and fruits of war were well con&s;idered, peace, with its inconveniencies, is generally pre|ferable. But though they were not for fighting, they were for &s;ubmitting to government; and that not only for fear, but for con&s;cience &s;ake, where government doth not interfere with con&s;cience: believing it to be an ordinance of God, and where it is ju&s;tly admini&s;tred, a great benefit to mankind: though it has been their lot, through blind zeal in &s;ome, and intere&s;t in others, to have felt the &s;trokes of it with greater weight and rigour than any other per&s;ua&s;ion in this age; whil&s;t they, of all others (religion &s;et a&s;ide) have given the civil magi&s;trate the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of trouble in the di&s;|charge of his office.</P>
<P N="5">V. Another part of the character of this people is, they refu&s;e to pay tythes, or maintenance to a national mini&s;try,
<PB N="xviii" REF="037441_0017_100D8D8129AE2E68">and that for two rea&s;ons; the one is, that they believe all compelled maintenance, even to go&s;pel mini&s;ters, to be un|lawful, becau&s;e expre&s;sly contrary to Chri&s;t's command, who &s;aid, "Freely you have received, freely give:" at lea&s;t, that the maintenance of go&s;pel mini&s;ters &s;hould be free and not forced. The other rea&s;on of their refu&s;al is, becau&s;e tho&s;e mini&s;ters are not go&s;pel ones, in that the Holy Gho&s;t is not their foundation, but human arts and parts: &s;o that it is not matter of humour or fullenne&s;s, but pure con&s;cience towards God, that they cannot help to &s;upport national mini&s;ters where they dwell, which are but too much and too vi&s;ibly become ways of worldly advantage and preferment.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Not to re&s;pect per&s;ons, was another of their doc|trines and practices, for which they were often buffeted and abu&s;ed. They affirmed it to be &s;inful to give flattering ti|tles, or to u&s;e vain ge&s;tures and compliments of re&s;pect; though to virtue and authority they ever made a difference, but after their plain and homely manner, yet &s;incere and &s;ub&s;tantial way; well remembering the example of Morde cai and Elihu, but more e&s;pecially the command of their Lord and Ma&s;ter Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who forbad his followers to call men Rabbi, which implies Lord and Ma&s;ter, al&s;o the fa&s;hionable greetings and &s;alutations of tho&s;e times; that &s;o &s;elf-love and honour, to which the proud mind of man is in|cident, in his fallen e&s;tate, might not be indulged but re|buked.</P>
<P>They al&s;o u&s;ed the plain language of Thou and Thee to a &s;ingle per&s;on, whatever was his degree among men. And indeed the wi&s;dom of God was much &s;een, in bringing forth this people in &s;o plain an appearance; for it was a clo&s;e and di&s;tingui&s;hing te&s;t upon the &s;pirit of tho&s;e they came among; &s;hewing their in&s;ides and what predominated, notwith&s;tand|ing their high and great profe&s;&s;ion of religion. This, among the re&s;t, &s;ounded &s;o har&s;h to many of them, and they took it &s;o ill, that they would &s;ay, <Q>Thou me, thou my dog: if thou thoue&s;t me, I'll thou thy teeth down thy throat,</Q> forgetting the language they u&s;e to God in their own prayers, and the common &s;tyle of the Scriptures, and that it is an ab|&s;olute and e&s;&s;ential propriety of &s;peech: and what good had their religion done them, who were &s;o &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with indignation for the u&s;e of this plain, hone&s;t, and true &s;peech.</P>
<P N="7">VII. They recommended &s;ilence by their example, having very few words upon all occa&s;ions: they were at a word in dealing; nor could their cu&s;tomers many words tempt them
<PB N="xix" REF="037441_0018_100D8D83901BEAA8">from it; having more regard for truth than cu&s;tom, to ex|ample than gain, they &s;ought &s;olitude; but when in compa|ny, they would neither u&s;e nor willingly hear unnece&s;&s;ary as well as unlawful di&s;cour&s;es; whereby they pre&s;erved their minds pure and undi&s;turbed from unprofitable thoughts and diver&s;ions: nor could they humour the cu&s;tom of <Q>good night, good morrow, God &s;peed;</Q> for they knew the night was good, and the day was good, without wi&s;hing of either; and that in the other expre&s;&s;ion, the holy name of God was too lightly and unthinkingly u&s;ed, and therefore taken in vain. Be&s;ides they were words and wi&s;hes of cour&s;e, and are u&s;ually as little meant, as are love and &s;ervice in the cu&s;tom of cap and knee; and &s;uperfluity in tho&s;e as well as in other things was burthen&s;ome to them, and therefore they did not only decline to u&s;e them, but &s;ound them&s;elves of|ten pre&s;t to reprove the practice.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on they forbore drinking to people, or pledging of them, as the manner of the world is: a practice that is not only unnece&s;&s;ary, but they thought evil in the tendencies of it; being a provocation to drinking more than did people good, as well as that it was in it&s;elf vain and heatheni&s;h.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Their way of marriage is peculiar to them, and is a di&s;tingui&s;hing practice from all other &s;ocieties profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tianity. They &s;ay that marriage is an ordinance of God, and that God only can rightly join man and woman in marriage. Therefore they u&s;e neither prie&s;t nor magi&s;|trate, but the man and woman concerned take each other as hu&s;band and wife in the pre&s;ence of divers credible wit|ne&s;&s;es, <Q>promi&s;ing unto each other, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to be loving and faithful in that relation till death &s;hall &s;e|parate them.</Q> But, antecedent to all this, they fir&s;t pre|&s;ent them&s;elves to the monthly meeting for the affairs of the church where they re&s;ide; there declaring their intentions to take one another as man and wife, if the &s;aid meeting have nothing material to object again&s;t it. They are con&s;tantly alked the nece&s;&s;ary que&s;tions, as in ca&s;e of parents or guar|dians, if they have acquainted them with their intention, and have their con&s;ent, &amp;c. The method of the meeting is to take a minute thereof, and to appoint proper per&s;ons to en|quire of their conver&s;ation and clearne&s;s from all others, and whether they have di&s;charged their duty to their parents or guardian, and make report thereof the next monthly meet|ing; where the &s;ame parties are de&s;ired to give their attend|ance.
<PB N="xx" REF="037441_0019_100D8D857A08EB18">In ca&s;e it appears they proceeded orderly, the meet|ing pa&s;&s;es their propo&s;al, and &s;o records it in their meeting-book; and in ca&s;e the woman be a widow and hath chil|dren, due care is there taken, that provi&s;ion al&s;o be made by her for the orphans before the &s;aid marriage; advi&s;ing the parties concerned to appoint a convenient time and place, and to give fitting notice to their relations, and &s;uch friends and neighbours as they de&s;ire &s;hould be the witue&s;&s;es of their marriage: where they take one another by the hand, and by name promi&s;ing reciprocally after the manner before ex|pre&s;&s;ed. Of all which proceedings a narrative, in a way of certificate, is made, to which the &s;aid parties fir&s;t &s;et their hands, thereby making it their act and deed; and then di|vers of the relations, &s;pectators, and auditors &s;et their names as witne&s;&s;es of what they &s;aid and &s;igned. Which certi&s;i|cate is afterwards regi&s;tered in the record belonging to the meeting where the marriage is &s;olemnized. Which regular method has been, as it de&s;erves, adjudged in courts of law a good marriage, where it has been di&s;puted and conte&s;ted for want of the accu&s;tomed formality of prie&s;t and ring. &amp;c. Which ceremonies they have refu&s;ed, not out of humour, but con&s;cience rea&s;onably grounded, ina&s;much as no &s;crip|ture-example tells us, that the prie&s;t had any other part of old time than that of a witne&s;s among the re&s;t, before whom the Jews u&s;ed to take one another: and therefore this people look upon it as an impo&s;ition to advance the power and profits of the clergy. And for the u&s;e of the ring, it is enough to &s;ay, that it was an heathen and vain cu&s;tom, and never in practice among the people of God, Jews or primitive Chri&s;|tians. The words of the u&s;ual form, as "With my body I thee wor&s;hip." &amp;c. are hardly defen&s;ible: in &s;hort, they are more careful, exact, and regular than any form now u&s;ed, and it is free of the inconveniencies other methods are attended with. Their care and checks being &s;o many, and &s;uch as no clande&s;tine marriages can be performed among them.</P>
<P N="9">IX. It may not be unfit to &s;ay &s;omething here of their births and burials, which make up &s;o much of the pomp and &s;olemnity of too many called Chri&s;tians. For births, the parents name their own children, which is u&s;ually &s;ome days after they are born, in the pre&s;ence of the midwife (if &s;he can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> there) and tho&s;e that were at the birth, &amp;c. who after|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ds &s;ign a certificate, for that purpo&s;e prepared, of the birth and name of the child or children, which is recorded
<PB N="xxi" REF="037441_0020_100D8D871962E2D8">in aproper book in the monthly meeting, to which the pa|rents belong; avoiding the accu&s;tomed ceremonies and fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P N="10">X. Their burials are performed with the &s;ame &s;implicity. If the corp&s;e of the decea&s;ed be near any public meeting-place, it is u&s;ually carried thither, for the more convenient reception of tho&s;e that accompany it to the ground they bu|ry in; and it &s;o falls out &s;ometimes, that while the meeting is gathering for the burial, &s;ome or other have a word of ex|hortation, for the &s;ake of the people there met together: af|ter which the body is borne away by the young men, or tho&s;e that are of their neighbourhood, or that were mo&s;t of the in|timacy of the decea&s;ed party; the corp&s;e being in a plain coffin, without any covering or furniture upon it. At the ground, they pau&s;e &s;ome time before they put the body in|to its grave, that if any one there &s;hould have any thing up|on them to exhort the people, they may not be di&s;appoint|ed, and that the relations may the more retiredly and &s;o|lemnly take their la&s;t leave of the corp&s;e of their departed kindred, and the &s;pectators have a &s;en&s;e of mortality, by the occa&s;ion then given them to reflect upon their own lat|ter end. Otherwi&s;e, they have no &s;et rites or ceremonies on tho&s;e occa&s;ions; neither do the kindred of the decea&s;ed ever wear mourning; they looking upon it as a worldly ce|remony, and piece of pomp; and that what mourning is fit for a chri&s;tian to have at the departure of a beloved relation or friend, &s;hould be worn in the mind, which is only &s;en&s;i|ble of the lo&s;s, and the love they had to them, and remem|brance of them, to be outwardly expre&s;&s;ed by a re&s;pect to their advice, and care of tho&s;e they have left behind them, and their love of that they loved. Which conduct of theirs, tho' unmodi&s;h or unfa&s;hionable, leaves nothing of the &s;ub|&s;tance of things neglected or undone; and as they aim at no more, &s;o that &s;implicity of life is what they ob&s;erve with great &s;atisfaction, though it &s;ometimes happens not to be without the mockeries of the vain world they live in.</P>
<P>The&s;e things gave them a rough and di&s;agreeable appear|ance with the generality; who thought them turners of the world up&s;ide-down, as indeed in &s;ome &s;en&s;e they were; but in no other than that wherein Paul was &s;o charged, viz. to bring things back into their primitive and right order again. For the&s;e and &s;uch like practices of theirs were not the re&s;ult of humour, as &s;ome have fancied, but a fruit of inward &s;en&s;e, which God, through his fear, had begotten in them. They
<PB N="xxii" REF="037441_0021_100D8D893A926E38">did not con&s;ider how to contradict the world, or di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves; being none of their bu&s;ine&s;s, as it was not their intere&s;t, no, it was not the re&s;ult of their con&s;ultation, or a framed de&s;ign to declare or recommend &s;chi&s;m or novelty. But God having given them a &s;ight of them&s;elves, they &s;aw the whole world in the &s;ame gla&s;s of truth; and &s;en&s;ibly di&s;|cerned the affections and pa&s;&s;ions of men, and the ri&s;e and tendency of things. What gratified <Q>the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life, which are not of the Father, but of the world;</Q> and from thence &s;prang in that night of darkne&s;s and apo&s;tacy, which hath been over people, through their degeneracy from the light and Spirit of God, the&s;e and many other vain cu&s;toms; which are &s;een by the heavenly day of Chri&s;t, which dawns in the &s;oul, to be, either wrong in their original, or, by time or abu&s;e, hurtful in their practice. And though the&s;e things &s;eemed trivial to &s;ome, and rendered this people &s;tingy and conceit|ed in &s;uch per&s;ons opinions, there was and is more in them than they were aware of. It was not very ea&s;y to our pri|mitive friends to make them&s;elves &s;ights and &s;pectacles, and the &s;corn and deri&s;ion of the world; which they ea&s;ily fore|&s;aw mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of &s;o unfa&s;hionable a conver&s;a|tion in it. But herein was the wi&s;dom of God &s;een, in the fooli&s;hne&s;s of the&s;e things. Fir&s;t, That they di&s;covered the &s;atisfaction and concern that people had in and for the fa&s;hions of this world, notwith&s;tanding their pretences to an|other; in that any di&s;appointment about them came &s;o very near them, that the greate&s;t hone&s;ty, virtue, wi&s;dom, and ability, were unwelcome without them. Secondly, It &s;ea|&s;onably and pro&s;itably divided conver&s;ation; for making their &s;ociety unea&s;y to their relations and acquaintance, it gave them the opportunity of more retirement and &s;olitude, wherein they met with better company, even the Lord God their Redeemer, and grew &s;trong in his love, power, and wi&s;dom, and were thereby better qualified for his &s;ervice, and the &s;ucce&s;s abundantly &s;hewed it; ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord.</P>
<P>And though they were not great and learned in the e&s;teem of this world (for then they had not wanted followers upon their own credit and authority) yet they were generally of the mo&s;t &s;ober of the &s;everal per&s;ua&s;ions they were in, and of the mo&s;t repute for religion; and many of them of good capa|city, &s;ub&s;tance, and account among men.</P>
<P>And al&s;o &s;ome among them neither wanted for parts,
<PB N="xxiii" REF="037441_0022_100D8D8B9882E318">learning nor e&s;tate; though then, as of old, not many wi&s;e, nor noble, &amp;c. were called, or at lea&s;t received the heavenly call; becau&s;e of the cro&s;s that attended the profe&s;&s;ion of it in &s;incerity: but neither do parts or learning make men the better Chri&s;tans, though the better orators and di&s;putants; and it is the ignorance of people about the divine gift, that cau&s;es that vulgar and mi&s;chievous mi&s;take. Theory and practice, expre&s;&s;ion and enjoyment, words and life, are two things. Oh! 'tis the penitent, the reformed, the lowly, the watchful, the &s;elf-denying and holy &s;oul that is the Chri&s;tian; and that frame is the &s;ruit and work of the Spi|rit, which is the life of Je&s;us; who&s;e life, though hid in God the Father, is &s;hed abroad in the hearts of them that truly be|lieve. Oh! that people did but know this to clean&s;e them, to circumci&s;e them, to quicken them, and to make them new creatures indeed; re-created or regenerated after Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works: that they might live to God, and not to them&s;elves; and offer up living prayers, and living prai&s;es, to the living God, through his own living Spirit, in which he is only to be wor&s;hipped in this go&s;pel-day. Oh! that they that read me could but feel me; for my heart is affected with this merciful vi&s;itation of the Father of lights and &s;pints to this poor nation, and the whole world through the &s;ame te&s;timony. Why &s;hould the inhabitants thereof re|ject it? Why &s;hould they lo&s;e the ble&s;&s;ed benefit of it? Why &s;hould they not turn to the Lord with all their hearts, and &s;ay from the heart, "Speak, Lord, for now thy poor &s;er|vants hear?" Oh! that thy will may be done, thy great, thy good and holy will, on earth as it is in heaven: do it in us, do it upon us, do what thou wilt with us; for we are thine, and de&s;ire to glorify thee our Creator, both for that, and becau&s;e thou art our Redeemer, for thou art redeeming us from the earth, from the vanities and pollutions of it, to be a peculiar people unto thee. Oh! this were a brave day for England, if &s;o &s;he could &s;ay in truth. But alas, the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e, for which &s;ome of thine inhabitants, O land of my nativity! have mourned over thee with bitter wailing and lamentation. Their heads have been indeed as waters, and their eyes as fountains of tears, becau&s;e of thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;tiffneckedne&s;s; becau&s;e thou wilt not hear, and fear, and return to the Rock, even thy Rock, O Eng|land! from whence thou wert hewn.

<P>She with&s;tood the Son of God in the fle&s;h, and thou re|&s;i&s;te&s;t the Son of God in the Spirit. He would have gather|ed her, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and &s;he would not! &s;o would he have gathered thee out of thy lifele&s;s profe&s;&s;ion, and have brought thee to inherit &s;ub&s;tance, to have known his power and kingdom, for which he often knocked within, by his Grace and Spirit, and without, by his &s;ervants and witne&s;&s;es; but thou would&s;t not be gather|ed: but on the contrary, as Jeru&s;alem of old per&s;ecuted the manife&s;tation of the Son of God in the fle&s;h, and crucified him, and whipped and impri&s;oned his &s;ervants, &s;o ha&s;t thou, O land, crucified to thy&s;elf afre&s;h the Lord of life and glory, and done de&s;pite to his Spirit of grace; &s;lighting the fatherly vi&s;itation, and per&s;ecuting the ble&s;&s;ed di&s;pen&s;ers of it by thy laws and magi&s;trates; though they have early and late pleaded with thee in the power and Spirit of the Lord, in love and meekne&s;s, that thou mighte&s;t know the Lord, and &s;erve him, and become the glory of all lands.</P>
<P>But thou ha&s;t evilly entreated and requited them. Thou ha&s;t &s;et at nought all their coun&s;el, and would&s;t have none of their reproof, as thou &s;hould&s;t have done. Their ap|pearance was too &s;trait, and their qualifications were too mean for thee to receive them, who, like the Jews of old, that cried, <Q>Is not this the carpenter's &s;on? and are not his brethren among us? which of the &s;cribes, of the learn|ed (the orthodox) believe in him?</Q> Prophe&s;ying their fall in a year or two, and making and executing of &s;evere laws to bring it to pa&s;s, by endeavouring to terrify them out of their holy way, or de&s;troying them for abiding faithful to it. But thou ha&s;t &s;een how many governments that ro&s;e again&s;t them, and determined their downfal, have been overturned and extingui&s;hed, and that they are &s;till pre&s;erved, and become a great and a con&s;iderable people among the middle &s;ort of thy numerous inhabitants. And notwith&s;tanding the many difficulties, without and within, which they have laboured under, &s;ince the Lord God Eternal fir&s;t gathered them, they are an increa&s;ing people, the Lord &s;till adding unto them, in divers parts, &s;uch as &s;hall be &s;aved, if they per&s;evere to the end. And to thee were they and are they lifted up as a

For in the <Q>light of the Lamb mu&s;t the nations of them that are &s;aved walk,</Q> as the &s;criptures te&s;tify.</P>
<P>Remember, O nation of great profe&s;&s;ion! how the Lord has waited upon thee &s;ince the days of reformation, and the many mercies and judgments with which he has pleaded with thee; and awake and ari&s;e out of thy deep &s;leep, and yet hear his word in thy heart, that thou maye&s;t live.</P>
<P>Let not this thy day of vi&s;itation pa&s;s over thy head, not neglect thou &s;o great &s;alvation as is this which is come to thy hou&s;e, O England! For why &s;hould&s;t thou die. O land that God de&s;ires to ble&s;s? Be a&s;&s;ured it is he that has been in the mid&s;t of this people, in the mid&s;t of thee; and no de|lu&s;ion, as thy mi&s;taken teachers have made thee believe.

<P N="1">I. They were changed men them&s;elves before they went about to change others. Their hearts were rent as well as their garments changed, and they knew the power and work of God upon them. This was &s;een by the great alteration it made, and their &s;tricter cour&s;e of life, and more godly con|ver&s;ation, that immediately followed upon it.</P>
<P N="2">II. They went not forth or preached in their own time or will, but in the will of God, and &s;poke not their own &s;tu|died matter, but as they were opened and moved of his Spi|rit. with which they were well acquainted in their own con|ver&s;ion; which cannot be expre&s;&s;ed to carnal men &s;o as to give them any intelligible account, for to &s;uch it is, as Chri&s;t &s;aid, <Q>like the blowing of the wind, which no man knows whence it cometh, or whither it goeth:</Q> yet this proof and &s;eal went along with their mini&s;try, that many were turned from their lifele&s;s profe&s;&s;ions and the evil of their ways, to the knowledge of God and an holy life, as thou&s;ands can wit|ne&s;s. And as they freely received what they had to &s;ay from the Lord, &s;o they freely admini&s;tered it to others.</P>
<P N="3">III. The bent and &s;tre&s;s of their mini&s;try was conver&s;ion to God, regeneration, and holine&s;s; not &s;chemes of doc|trines and verbal creeds, or new forms of wor&s;hip; but a leaving off in religion the &s;uper&s;luous, and reducing the ce|remonious and formal part, and pre&s;&s;ing earne&s;tly the &s;ub&s;tan|tial,
<PB N="xxvi" REF="037441_0025_100D8D917AF25CD0">the nece&s;&s;ary and profitable part; as all upon a &s;erious reflection mu&s;t and do acknowledge.</P>
<P N="4">IV. They directed people to a principle, by which all that they a&s;&s;erted, preached, and exhorted others to, might be wrought in them, and known, through experience, to them to be true; which is a high and di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of the truth of their mini&s;try; both that they knew what they &s;aid, and were not afraid of coming to the te&s;t. For as they were bold from certainty, &s;o they required confor|mity upon no human authority, but upon conviction, and the conviction of this principle, which they a&s;&s;erted was in them that they preached unto, and unto that directed them, that they might examine and prove the reality of tho&s;e things which they had affirmed of it, and its manife&s;tation and work in man. And this is more than the many mini|&s;tries in the world pretend to. They declare of religion; &s;ay many things true in words, of God, Chri&s;t, and the Spirit; of holine&s;s and heaven; that all men &s;hould repent and mend their lives, or they will go to hell, &amp;c. but which of them all pretend to &s;peak of their own knowledge and experience? or ever directed men to a divine principle or agent, placed of God in man, to help him? and how to know it, and wait to feel its power to work that good and acceptable will of God in them?</P>
<P>Some of them indeed have &s;poke of the Spirit, and the operations of it to &s;anctification, and performance of wor&s;hip to God; but where and how to find it, and wait in it to perform, was yet as a my&s;tery re&s;erved for this further de|gree of reformation. So that this people did not only in words more than equally pre&s;s repentance, conver&s;ion, and holine&s;s, but did it knowingly and experimentally; and directed tho&s;e to whom they preached to a &s;ufficient princi|ple, and told them where it is, and by what tokens they might know it, and which way they might experience the power and efficacy of it to their &s;ouls happine&s;s: which is more than theory and &s;peculations, upon which mo&s;t other mini&s;tries depend; for here is certainly a bottom upon which man may boldly appear before God in the great day of account.</P>
<P N="5">V. They reached to the inward &s;tate and condition of people, which is an evidence of the virtue of their principle, and of their mini&s;tring from it, and not their own imagina|tions, glo&s;&s;es, or comments upon &s;cripture. For nothing reaches the heart but what is from the heart, or pierces the
<PB N="xxvii" REF="037441_0026_100D8D9414B7F098">con&s;cience but what comes from a living con&s;cience; in&s;o|much as it hath often happened, where people have under &s;ecrecy revealed their &s;tate or condition to &s;ome choice friends for advice or ea&s;e, they have been &s;o particularly directed in the mini&s;try of this people, that they have challenged their friends with di&s;covering their &s;ecrets, and telling the preachers their ca&s;es; yea, the very thoughts and purpo&s;es of the hearts of many have been &s;o plainly detected, that they have, like Nathaniel, cried out of this inward appear|ance of Chri&s;t, "Thou art the Son of God, thou art the king of I&s;rael." And tho&s;e that have embraced this divine principle, have found this mark of its truth and divinity, that the woman of Samaria did of Chri&s;t when in the fle&s;h, to be the Me&s;&s;iah, viz. "It had told them all that ever they did;" &s;hewed them their in&s;ides, the mo&s;t inward &s;ecrets of their hearts, and laid judgment to the line, and righteou&s;|ne&s;s to the plummet; of which thou&s;ands can at this day give in their witne&s;s. So that nothing has been affirmed by this people of the power and virtue of this heavenly principle, that &s;uch as have turned to it have not found true, and more; and that one half had not been told to them of what they have &s;een of the power, purity, wi&s;dom, mercy, and goodne&s;s of God herein.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The accompli&s;hments with which this principle fit|ted even &s;ome of the meane&s;t of this people for their work and &s;ervice, furni&s;ning &s;ome of them with an extraordinary under&s;tanding in divine things, and an admirable fluency and taking way of expre&s;&s;ion, which gave occa&s;ion to &s;ome to wonder, &s;aying of them, as of their Ma&s;ter, "Is not this &s;uch a mechanick's &s;on? how came he by this learning?" As from thence others took occa&s;ion to &s;u&s;pect and in&s;inu|ate they were je&s;uits in di&s;gui&s;e, who have had the reputa|tion of learned men for an age pa&s;t, though there was not the lea&s;t ground of truth for any &s;uch reflection.</P>
<P N="7">VII. They came forth low, and de&s;pi&s;ed and hated, as the primitive chri&s;tians did, and not by the help of worldly wi&s;dom or power, as former reformations in part have done; but in all things it may be &s;aid this people were brought forth in the cro&s;s, in a contradiction to the ways, wor&s;hip, fa&s;hion, and cu&s;toms of this world, yea again&s;t wind and tide, that &s;o no fle&s;h might glory before God.</P>
<P>They could have no de&s;ign to them&s;elves in this work, thus to expo&s;e them&s;elves to &s;corn and abu&s;e, to &s;pend and be &s;pent; leaving wife and children, hou&s;e and land, and
<PB N="xxviii" REF="037441_0027_100D8D95A6F01BF0">all that can be accounted dear to men, with their lives in their hands, being daily in jeopardy, to declare this primi|tive me&s;&s;age, 1 John i. v. revived in their &s;pirits by the good Spirit and power of God; viz. <Q>That God is light, and in him is no darkne&s;s at all; and that he has &s;ent his Son a light into the world to enlighten all men in order to &s;alvation; and that they that &s;ay they have fellow&s;hip with God, and are his children and people, and yet walk in darkne&s;s, (viz. in di&s;obedience to the light in their con|&s;ciences, and after the vanity of this world) they lie and do not the truth. But that all &s;uch as love the light and bring their deeds to it, and walk in the light, as God is light, the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his &s;on &s;hould clean&s;e them from all &s;in.</Q></P>
<P N="8">VIII. Their known great con&s;tancy and patience in &s;uf|fering for their te&s;timony, in all the branches of it, and that &s;ometimes unto death, by beatings, brui&s;ings, long and crowded impri&s;onments, and noi&s;ome dungeons. Four of them in New England dying by the hands of the execu|tioner, purely for preaching among&s;t that people; be&s;ides bani&s;hments and exce&s;&s;ive plunders and &s;eque&s;trations of their goods and e&s;tates, almo&s;t in all parts, not ea&s;ily to be expre&s;&s;ed, and le&s;s to be endured, but by tho&s;e that have the &s;upport of a good and glorious cau&s;e; refu&s;ing deliver|ance by any indirect ways and means, as often as it was offered to them.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That they did not only not &s;hew any di&s;po&s;ition to revenge, when it was at any time in their power, but for|gave their cruel enemies, &s;hewing mercy to tho&s;e that had none for them.</P>
<P N="10">X. Their plainne&s;s with tho&s;e in authority, not unlike the ancient prophets; not fearing to tell them to their faces of their private and publick &s;ins, and their prophecies to them of their afflictions and downfal, when in the top of their glory; al&s;o of &s;ome national judgments, as of the plague and fire of London, in expre&s;s terms, and likewi&s;e particular ones to divers per&s;ecutors, which accordingly overtook them, and which were very remarkable in the places where they dwelt, and in time they may be made publick for the glory of God.</P>
<P>Thus, reader, thou &s;ee&s;t this people in thein ri&s;e, princi|ples, mini&s;try, and progre&s;s, both their general and parti|cular te&s;timony, by which thou maye&s;t be informed how and upon what foot they &s;prung and became &s;o con&s;iderable
<PB N="xxix" REF="037441_0028_100D8D979B29F6D8">a people. It remains next that I &s;hew al&s;o their care, con|duct, and di&s;cipline, as a chri&s;tian and reformed &s;ociety, that they might be found living up to their own principles and profe&s;&s;ion; and this the rather, becau&s;e they have hardly &s;uffered more in their character from the unju&s;t charge of error, than by the fal&s;e imputation of di&s;order; which ca|lumny indeed has not failed to follow all the true &s;teps that were ever made to reformation, and under which reproach none &s;uffered more than the primitive chri&s;tians them|&s;elves, that were the honour of chri&s;tianity, and the great lights and examples of their own and &s;ucceeding ages.</P>
<P>This people increa&s;ing daily both in town and country, an holy care fell upon &s;ome of the elders among them for the benefit and &s;ervice of the church. And the fir&s;t bu&s;i|ne&s;s in their view, after the example of the primitive &s;aints, was the exerci&s;e of charity, to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of the poor, and an&s;wer the like occa&s;ions: wherefore collections were early and liberally made for that and divers other &s;er|vices in the church, and intru&s;ted with faithful men, fear|ing God, and of good report, who were not weary in well-doing; adding often of their own in large proportions, which they never brought to account or de&s;ired &s;hould be known, much le&s;s re&s;tored to them, that none might want, nor any &s;ervice be retarded or di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>They were al&s;o very careful, that every one that belonged to them an&s;wered their profe&s;&s;ion in their behaviour among men upon all occa&s;ions; that they lived peaceably, and were in all things good examples. They found them&s;elves engaged to record their &s;ufferings and &s;ervices; and in ca&s;e of marriage, which they could not perform in the u&s;ual me|thods of the nation, but among them&s;elves, they took care that all things were clear between the parties and all others, and it was then rare that any one entertained &s;uch inclina|tion to a per&s;on on that account, till he or &s;he had commu|nicated it &s;ecretly to &s;ome very weighty and eminent friends among them, that they might have a &s;en&s;e of the matter; looking to the coun&s;el and unity of their brethren as of great moment to them. But becau&s;e the charge of the poor, the number of orphans, marriages, &s;ufferings, and other mat|ters multiplied, and that it was good that the churches were in &s;ome way and method of proceeding in &s;uch affairs among them, to the end they might the better corre&s;pond upon oc|ca&s;ion, where a member of one meeting might have to do with one of another; it plea&s;ed the Lord in his wi&s;dom and
<PB N="xxx" REF="037441_0029_100D8D9967D382C8">goodne&s;s to open the under&s;tanding of the fir&s;t in&s;trument of this di&s;pen&s;ation of life, about a good and orderly way of proceeding; and he felt an holy concern to vi&s;it the churches in per&s;on throughout this nation, to begin and e&s;tabli&s;h it among them; and by his epi&s;tles the like was done in other nations and provinces abroad, which he al&s;o afterwards vi&s;ited and helped in that &s;ervice, as &s;hall be ob|&s;erved when I come to &s;peak of him.</P>
<P>Now the care, conduct, and di&s;cipline, I have been &s;peak|ing of, and which is now practi&s;ed among this people, is as followeth:
This godly elder, in every county where he travelled, exhorted them, that &s;ome out of every meeting of wor&s;hip &s;hould meet together once in the month, to confer about the wants and occa&s;ions of the church: and as the ca&s;e re|quired, &s;o tho&s;e monthly meetings were fewer or more in number in every re&s;pective county; four or &s;ix meetings of wor&s;hip u&s;ually making one monthly meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s. And accordingly the brethren met him from place to place, and began the &s;aid meetings; viz. <Q>For the poor, orphans, orderly walking, integrity to their profe&s;&s;ion, births, mar|riages, burials, &s;ufferings, &amp;c.</Q> And that the&s;e monthly meetings &s;hould in each county make up one quarterly meet|ing, where the mo&s;t zealous and eminent friends of the county &s;hould a&s;&s;emble to communicate, advi&s;e, and help one another, e&s;pecially when any bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eemed difficult, or a monthly meeting was tender of determining a matter.</P>
<P>Al&s;o that the&s;e quarterly meetings &s;hould dige&s;t the re|ports of the monthly meetings, and prepare one for the county again&s;t the yearly meeting, in which the quarterly meetings re&s;olve, which is held yearly in London, where the churches in this nation and other nations and provinces meet, by cho&s;en members of their re&s;pective counties, both mutually to communicate their church-affairs, and to advi&s;e and be advi&s;ed in any depending ca&s;e to edification; al&s;o to provide a requi&s;ite &s;tock for the di&s;charge of general ex|pences for general &s;ervices in the church, not needful to be here particularized.</P>
<P>At the&s;e meetings any of the members of the churches may come, if they plea&s;e, and &s;peak their minds freely in the fear of God to any matter; but the mind of each meet|ing therein repre&s;ented is chiefly under&s;tood, as to particu|lar ca&s;es, in the &s;en&s;e delivered by the per&s;ons deputed or cho&s;en for that &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxi" REF="037441_0030_100D8D9C88E9D088">
During their yearly meeting, to which their other meet|ings refer in their order, and re&s;olve them&s;elves, care is taken by a &s;elect number, for that &s;ervice cho&s;en by the ge|neral a&s;&s;embly, to draw up the minutes of the &s;aid meet|ing upon the &s;everal matters that have been under con&s;ider|ation therein, to the end that the re&s;pective quarterly and monthly meetings may be informed of all proceedings, to|gether with a general exhortation to holine&s;s, unity and charity: of all which proceedings in yearly, quarterly, and monthly meetings, due record is kept by &s;ome one appointed for that &s;ervice, or that hath voluntarily undertaken it. The&s;e meetings are opened and u&s;ually concluded in their &s;olemn waiting upon God, who is &s;ometimes graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to an&s;wer them with as &s;ignal evidences of his love and pre|&s;ence, as in any other of their meetings for wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>It is farther to be noted, that, in the&s;e &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies for the church's &s;ervice, there is no one pre&s;ides among them after the manner of the a&s;&s;emblies of other people, Chri&s;t only being their pre&s;ident, as he is plea&s;ed to appear in life and wi&s;dom in any one or more of them, to whom, whatever be their capacity or degree, the re&s;t adhere with a firm unity, not of authority but conviction, which is the divine authority and way of Chri&s;t's power and &s;pirit in his people; making good his ble&s;&s;ed promi&s;e, <Q>That he would be in the mid&s;t of his, where and whenever they were met together in his name, even to the end of the world.</Q> So be it.</P>
<P>Now it may be expected I &s;hould here &s;et down what &s;ort of authority is exerci&s;ed by this people upon &s;uch members of their &s;ociety as corre&s;pond not in their lives with their profe&s;&s;ion, and that are refractory to this good and whole|&s;ome order &s;ettled among them; and the rather, becau&s;e they have not wanted their reproach and &s;uffering from &s;ome tongues upon this occa&s;ion in a plentiful manner.</P>
<P>The power they exerci&s;e is &s;uch as Chri&s;t has given to his own people to the end of the world in the per&s;ons of his di&s;ciples; viz. "To over&s;ee, exhort, reprove," and after long-&s;uffering and waiting upon the di&s;obedient and refrac|tory, <Q>to di&s;own them as any more of their communion, or that they will any longer &s;tand charged in the &s;ight and judgment of God or men with their conver&s;ation or behaviour as one of them until they repent.</Q> The &s;ub|ject-matter about which this authority, in any of the fore|going branches of it, is exerci&s;ed, is, fir&s;t, in relation to
<PB N="xxxii" REF="037441_0031_100D8D9E1EEF2C98">common and general practice: and, &s;econdly, about tho&s;e things that more &s;trictly refer to their own character and profe&s;&s;ion, and di&s;tingui&s;h them from all other profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity; avoiding two extremes upon which many &s;plit, viz. per&s;ecution and libertini&s;m. A coercive power to whip people into the temple; that &s;uch as will not conform, though again&s;t faith and con&s;cience, &s;hall be puni&s;hed in their per&s;ons or e&s;tates; or leaving all loo&s;e and at large as to practice, unaccountable to all but God and the magi&s;|trate. To which hurtful extreme nothing has more con|tributed, than the abu&s;e of church-power by &s;uch as &s;uffer their pa&s;&s;ions and private intere&s;ts to prevail with them to carry it to outward force and corporal puni&s;hment; a prac|tice they have been taught to di&s;like by their extreme &s;uf|ferings, as well as their known principle for an univer&s;al liberty of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>On the other hand they equally di&s;like an independency in &s;ociety; an unaccountablene&s;s in practice and conver&s;a|tion to the terms of their own communion, and to tho&s;e that are the members of it. They di&s;tingui&s;h between impo&s;ing any practice that immediately regards faith or wor&s;hip (which is never to be done, nor &s;uffered, or &s;ubmitted unto) and requiring chri&s;tian compliance with tho&s;e methods that only re&s;pect church-bu&s;ine&s;s in its more civil part and con|cern, and that regard the di&s;creet and orderly maintenance of the character of the &s;ociety, as a &s;ober and religious com|munity. In &s;hort, what is for the promotion of holine&s;s and charity, that men may practi&s;e what they profe&s;s, live up to their own principles, and not be at liberty to give the lie to their own profe&s;&s;ion without rebuke. They compel none to them, but oblige tho&s;e that are of them to walk &s;uitably, or they are denied by them: that is all the mark they &s;et upon them, and the power they exerci&s;e, or judge a chri&s;tian &s;ociety can exerci&s;e upon tho&s;e that are the members of it.</P>
<P>The way of their proceedings again&s;t &s;uch as have lap&s;ed or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed is this. He is vi&s;ited by &s;ome of them, and the matter of fact laid home to him, be it any evil practice again&s;t known and general virtue, or any branch of their particular te&s;timony, which he, in common, profe&s;&s;eth with them. They labour with him in much love and zeal for the good of his &s;oul, the honour of God, and reputation of their profe&s;&s;ion, to own his fault, and condemn it, in as ample a manner as the evil or &s;candal was given by him;
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="037441_0032_100D8DA06AEF4988">which for the mo&s;t part, is performed by &s;ome written te&s;ti|mony under the party's hand: and if it &s;o happen that the party prove refractory, and is not willing to clear the truth they profe&s;s from the reproach of his or her evil-doing or unfaithfulne&s;s, they, after repeated intreaties, and due wait|ing for a token of repentance, give forth a paper to di&s;own &s;uch a fact, and the party offending; recording the &s;ame as a te&s;timony of their care for the honour of the truth they profe&s;s.</P>
<P>And if he or &s;he &s;hall clear their profe&s;&s;ion and them|&s;elves, by &s;incere acknowledgment of their fault, and godly &s;orrow for &s;o doing, they are received, and looked upon again as members of their communion. For as God, &s;o his true people upbraid no man after repentance.</P>
<P>This is the account I had to give of the people of God called Quakers, as to their ri&s;e, appearance, principles, and practices in this age of the world, both with re&s;pect to their faith and wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline and conver&s;ation. And I judge it very proper in this place, becau&s;e it is to preface the journal of the fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ed and glorious in&s;trument of this work, and for a te&s;timony to him in his &s;ingular qualifica|tions and &s;ervices, in which he abundantly excelled in this his day, and are worthy to be &s;et forth as an example to all &s;ucceeding times, to the glory of the Mo&s;t High God, and for a ju&s;t memorial to that worthy and excellent man, his faithful &s;ervant and apo&s;tle to this generation of the world.</P>
<P>I am now come to the third head or branch of my pre|face, viz. the in&s;trumental author. For it is natural for &s;ome to &s;ay, Well, here is the people and work, but where and who was the man, the in&s;trument; he that in this age was &s;ent to begin this work and people? I &s;hall, as God &s;hall enable me, declare who and what he was, not only by report of others, but from my own long and mo&s;t inward conver&s;e and intimate knowledge of him; for which my &s;oul ble&s;&s;eth God, as it hath often done; and I doubt not, but by that time I have di&s;charged my&s;elf of this part of my preface, my &s;erious readers will believe I had good cau&s;e &s;o to do.</P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ed in&s;trument of and in this day of God, and of whom I am now about to write, was GEORGE FOX, di&s;|tingui&s;hed from another of that name, by that other's addi|tion of younger to his name in all his writings; not that he was &s;o in years, but that he was &s;o in the truth; but he was al&s;o a worthy man, witne&s;s and &s;ervant of God in his time.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxiv" REF="037441_0033_100D8DA20913DE28">
But this George Fox was born in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, about the year 1624. He de&s;cended of hone&s;t and &s;ufficient pa|rents, who endeavoured to bring him up, as they did the re&s;t of their children, in the way and wor&s;hip of the nation; e&s;pecially his mother, who was a woman accompli&s;hed above mo&s;t of her degree in the place where &s;he lived. But from a child he appeared of another frame of mind than the re&s;t of his brethren; being more religious, inward, &s;till, &s;olid, and ob&s;erving, beyond his years, as the an&s;wers he would give, and the que&s;tions he would put upon occa&s;ion mani|fe&s;ted, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of tho&s;e that heard him, e&s;pecially in divine things.</P>
<P>His mother taking notice of his &s;ingular temper, and the gravity, wi&s;dom, and piety that very early &s;hone through him, refu&s;ing childi&s;h and vain &s;ports and company when very young, &s;he was tender and indulgent over him, &s;o that from her he met with little difficulty. As to his employ|ment, he was brought up in country bu&s;ine&s;s; and as he took mo&s;t delight in &s;heep, &s;o he was very &s;kilful in them; an employment that very well &s;uited his mind in &s;everal re&s;pects, both for its innocency and &s;olitude; and was a ju&s;t figure of his after mini&s;try and &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not break in upon his own account, which is by much the be&s;t that can be given; and therefore de&s;ire, what I can, to avoid &s;aying any thing of what is &s;aid already, as to the particular pa&s;&s;ages of his coming forth: but, in gene|ral, when he was &s;omewhat above twenty, he left his friends, and vi&s;ited the mo&s;t retired and religious people, and &s;ome there were at that time in this nation, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e parts, who waited for the con&s;olation of I&s;rael night and day, as Zacharias, Anna, and good old Simeon did of old time. To the&s;e he was &s;ent, and the&s;e he &s;ought out in the neighbouring countries, and among them he &s;ojourned till his more ample mini&s;try came upon him.</P>
<P>At this time he taught and was an example of &s;ilence, endeavouring to bring people from &s;elf-performances, te&s;ti|fying and turning to the light of Chri&s;t within them, and encouraging them to wait in patience to feel the power of it to &s;tir in their hearts, that their knowledge and wor&s;hip of God might &s;tand in the power of an endle&s;s life, which was to be found in the light, as it was obeyed in the mani|fe&s;tation of it in man. <Q>For in the Word was life, and that life was the light of men.</Q> Life in the Word, light in men, and life too, as the light is obeyed; the children of
<PB N="xxxv" REF="037441_0034_100D8DA48BBBDC48">the light living by the life of the Word, by which the Word begets them again to God, which is the regeneration and new birth, without which there is no coming unto the king|dom of God; and which, whoever comes to, is greater than John, that is, than John's mini&s;try, which was not that of the kingdom, but the con&s;ummation of the legal, and open|ing of the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation. Accordingly, &s;everal meet|ings were gathered in tho&s;e parts; and thus his time was employed for &s;ome years.</P>
<P>In 1652, he being in his u&s;ual retirement to the Lord upon a very high mountain, in &s;ome of the hither parts of York&s;hire, as I take it, his mind exerci&s;ed towards the Lord, he had a vi&s;ion of the great work of God in the earth, and of the way that he was to go forth to begin it. He &s;aw people as thick as motes in the &s;un, that &s;hould in time be brought home to the Lord, that there might be but one Shepherd and one &s;heepfold in all the earth. There his eye was directed northward, beholding a great people that &s;hould receive him and his me&s;&s;age in tho&s;e parts. Upon this mountain he was moved of the Lord to &s;ound out his great and notable day, as if he had been in a great auditory, and from thence went north, as the Lord had &s;hewn him: and in every place where he came, if not before he came to it, he had his particular exerci&s;e and &s;ervice &s;hewn to him, &s;o that the Lord was his leader indeed; for it was not in vain that he travelled, God in mo&s;t places &s;ealing his com|mi&s;&s;ion with the convincement of &s;ome of all &s;orts, as well publicans as &s;ober profe&s;&s;ors of religion. Some of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t eminent of them, which are at re&s;t, were Richard Farn&s;worth, James Nayler, William Dew&s;berry, Francis Howgil, Edward Burrough, John Camm. John Audland, Richard Hubberthorn, T. Taylor, John Aldam, T. Holmes, Alexander Parker, William Simp&s;on, William Caton, John Stubbs, Robert Widders, John Burnyeat, Robert Lodge, Thomas Salthou&s;e, and many more worthies, that cannot be well here named, together with divers yet living of the fir&s;t and great convincement, who after the knowledge of God's purging judgments in them&s;elves, and &s;ome time of waiting in &s;ilence upon him, to feel and receive power from on high to &s;peak in his name (which none el&s;e rightly can, though they may u&s;e the &s;ame words.) felt the divine mo|tions, and were frequently drawn forth, e&s;pecially to vi&s;it the publick a&s;&s;emblies, to reprove, inform, and exhort them, &s;ometimes in markets, fairs, &s;treets, and by the highway &s;ide,
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="037441_0035_100D8DA69BC2EB18">calling people to repentance, and to turn to the Lord with their hearts as well as their mouths; directing them to the light of Chri&s;t within them, to &s;ee and examine and con|&s;ider their ways by, and to e&s;chew the evil and do the good and acceptable will of God. And they &s;uffered great hard|&s;hips for this their love and good-will, being often &s;tocked, &s;toned, beaten, whipped, and impri&s;oned, though hone&s;t men and of good report where they lived, that had left wives and children, and hou&s;es and lands, to vi&s;it them with a living call to repentance. And though the prie&s;ts generally &s;et them&s;elves to oppo&s;e them, and write again&s;t them, and in&s;inuated mo&s;t fal&s;e and &s;candalous &s;tories to defame them, &s;tirring up the magi&s;trates to &s;uppre&s;s them, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e northern parts, yet God was plea&s;ed &s;o to fill them with his living power, and give them &s;uch an open door of utterance in his &s;ervice, that there was a mighty convince|ment over tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>And through the tender and &s;ingular indulgence of Judge Brad&s;haw and Judge Fell, in the infancy of things, the prie&s;ts were never able to gain the point they laboured for, which was to have proceeded to blood, and if po&s;&s;ible, Herod-like, by a cruel exerci&s;e of the civil power, to have cut them off and rooted them out of the country. E&s;pe|cially Judge Fell, who was not only a check to their rage in the cour&s;e of legal proceedings, but otherwi&s;e upon oc|ca&s;ion, and finally countenanced this people; for his wife receiving the truth with the fir&s;t, it had that influence upon his &s;pirit, being a ju&s;t and wi&s;e man, and &s;eeing in his own wi&s;e and family a full confutation of all the popular cla|mours again&s;t the way of truth, that he covered them what he could, and freely opened his doors, and gave up his hou&s;e to his wife and her friends, not valuing the reproach of ignorant or evil-minded people, which I here mention to his and her honour, and which will be I believe an honour and a ble&s;&s;ing to &s;uch of their name and family as &s;hall be found in that tenderne&s;s, humility, love, and zeal for the truth and people of the Lord.</P>
<P>That hou&s;e was for &s;ome years at fir&s;t, till the truth had opened its way in the &s;outhern parts of this i&s;land, an emi|nent receptacle of this people. Others of good note and &s;ub&s;tance in tho&s;e northern countries had al&s;o opened their hou&s;es with their hearts to the many publi&s;hers, that in a &s;hort time the Lord had rai&s;ed to declare his &s;alvation to the people, and where meetings of the Lord's me&s;&s;engers
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="037441_0036_100D8DA8F3F423F0">were frequently held, to communicate their &s;ervices and exerci&s;es, and comfort and edify one another in their ble&s;&s;ed mini&s;try.</P>
<P>But le&s;t this may be thought a digre&s;&s;ion, having touched upon this before, I return to this excellent man: and for his per&s;onal qualities, both natural, moral, and divine, as they appeared in his conver&s;e with his brethren and in the church of God, take as follows.</P>
<P N="1">I. He was a man that God endowed with a clear and wonderful depth, a di&s;cerner of others &s;pirits, and very much a ma&s;ter of his own. And though the &s;ide of his under &s;tanding which lay next to the world, and e&s;pecially the expre&s;&s;ion of it, might found uncouth and unfa&s;hionable to nice ears, his matter was neverthele&s;s very profound, and would not only bear to be often con&s;idered, but the more i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was &s;o, the more weighty and in&s;tructing it appeared. And as abruptly and brokenly as &s;ometimes his &s;entences would fall from him about divine things, it is well known they were often as texts to many fairer declarations. And indeed it &s;hewed beyond all contradiction that God &s;ent him, that no arts or parts had any &s;hare in the matter or manner of his mini&s;try, and that &s;o many great, excellent, and nece&s;|&s;ary truths as he came forth to preach to mankind, had there|fore nothing of man's wit or wi&s;dom to recommend them. So that as to man he was an original, being no man's copy. And his mini&s;try and writings &s;hew they are from one that was not taught of man, nor had learned what he &s;aid by &s;tudy. Nor were they notional or &s;peculative, but &s;en&s;ible and practical truths, tending to conver&s;ion and regeneration, and the &s;etting up the kingdom of God in the hearts of men, and the way of it was his work. So that I have many times been overcome in my&s;elf, and been made to &s;ay with my Lord and Ma&s;ter upon the like occa&s;ion, <Q>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent of this world, and revealed them to babes;</Q> for many times hath my &s;oul bowed in an humble thankfulne&s;s to the Lord, that he did not choo&s;e any of the wi&s;e and learned of this world to be the fir&s;t me&s;&s;enger in our age of his ble&s;&s;ed truth to men; but that he took one that was not of high degree, or elegant &s;peech, or learned after the way of this world, that his me&s;|&s;age and work he &s;ent him to do might come with le&s;s &s;u&s;|picion or jealou&s;y of human wi&s;dom and intere&s;t, and with more force and clearne&s;s upon the con&s;ciences of tho&s;e that
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="037441_0037_100D8DAB0AF45240">&s;incerely &s;ought the way of truth in the love of it. I &s;ay, beholding with the eye of my mind, which the God of hea|ven had opened in me, the marks of God's finger and hand vi&s;ibly in this te&s;timony from the clearne&s;s of the principle, the power and efficacy of it in the exemplary &s;obriety, plainne&s;s, zeal, &s;teadine&s;s, humility, gravity, punctuality, charity, and circum&s;pect care in the government of church|affairs, which &s;hined in his and their life and te&s;timony that God employed in this work, it greatly confirmed me that it was of God, and engaged my &s;oul in a deep love, fear, reverence, and thank&s;ulne&s;s for his love and mercy therein to mankind; in which mind I remain, and &s;hall, I hope, to the end of my days.</P>
<P N="2">II. In his te&s;timony or mini&s;try he much laboured to open truth to the people's under&s;tandings, and to bottom them upon the principle and principal, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the light of the world, that by bringing them to &s;omething that was of God in them&s;elves, they might the better know and judge of him and them&s;elves.</P>
<P>He had an extraordinary gift in opening the &s;criptures. He would go to the marrow of things, and &s;hew the mind, harmony, and fulfilling of them with much plainne&s;s, and to great comfort and edification.</P>
<P>The my&s;tery of the fir&s;t and &s;econd Adam, of the fall and re&s;toration, of the law and go&s;pel, of &s;hadows and &s;ub&s;tance, of the &s;ervant and &s;on's &s;tate, and the ful&s;illing of the &s;criptures in Chri&s;t, and by Chri&s;t the true light, in all that are his, through the obedience of faith, were much of the &s;ub&s;tance and drift of his te&s;timonies. In all which he was witne&s;&s;ed to be of God, being &s;en&s;ibly felt to &s;peak that which he had received of Chri&s;t, and was his own ex|perience in that which never errs nor fails.</P>
<P>But above all he excelled in prayer. The inwardne&s;s and weight of his &s;pirit, the reverence and &s;olemnity of his addre&s;s and behaviour, and the fewne&s;s and fulne&s;s of his words, have often &s;truck even &s;trangers with admiration, as they u&s;ed to reach others with con&s;olation. The mo&s;t awful, living, reverent frame I ever felt or beheld, I mu&s;t &s;ay, was his in prayer. And truly it was a te&s;timony he knew, and lived nearer to the Lord than other men; for they that know him mo&s;t will &s;ee mo&s;t rea&s;on to approach him with reverence and fear.</P>
<P>He was of an innocent life, no bu&s;y-body, nor &s;elf-&s;eeker, neither touchy nor critical: what fell from him was very in|offen&s;ive,
<PB N="xxxix" REF="037441_0038_100D8DAD2170CA80">if not very edifying. So meek, contented, mo|de&s;t, ea&s;y, &s;teady, tender, it was a plea&s;ure to be in his company. He exerci&s;ed no authority but over evil, and that every-where and in all; but with love, compa&s;&s;ion, and long-&s;uffering. A mo&s;t merciful man, as ready to forgive as unapt to take or give an offence. Thou&s;ands can truly &s;ay, he was of an excellent &s;pirit and favour among them, and becau&s;e thereof the mo&s;t excellent &s;pirits loved him with an unfeigned and unfading love.</P>
<P>He was an ince&s;&s;ant labourer; for in his younger time, before his many great and deep &s;ufferings and travels had enfeebled his body for intinerant &s;ervices, he laboured much in the word and doctrine and di&s;cipline in England, Scotland, and Ireland, turning many to God, and confirming tho&s;e that were convinced of the truth, and &s;ettling good order as to church-affairs among them. And towards the conclu&s;ion of his travelling &s;ervices, between the years &s;eventy-one and &s;eventy-&s;even, he vi&s;ited the churches of Chri&s;t in the plant|ations in America, and in the United Provinces, and Ger|many, as his following Journal relates, to the convincement and con&s;olation of many. After that time he chiefly re&s;i|ded in and about the city of London, and be&s;ides the &s;ervices of his mini&s;try, which were frequent, he wrote much both to them that are within and tho&s;e that are without the com|munion. But the care he took of the affairs of the church in general was very great.</P>
<P>He was often where the records of the affairs of the church are kept, and the letters from the many meetings of God's people over all the world, where &s;ettled, come upon occa|&s;ions; which letters he had read to him, and communicated them to the meeting that is weekly held there for &s;uch &s;er|vices; he would be &s;ure to &s;tir them up to di&s;charge them, e&s;pecially in &s;uffering ca&s;es: &s;hewing great &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion upon all &s;uch occa&s;ions, carefully looking into the re&s;pective ca&s;es, and endeavouring &s;peedy relief accord|ing to the nature of them; &s;o that the churches and any of the &s;uffering members thereof were &s;ure not to be forgotten or delayed in their de&s;ires if he were there.</P>
<P>As he was unwearied, &s;o he was undaunted in his &s;ervices for God and his people; he was no more to be moved to fear than to wrath. His behaviour at Derby, Litchfield, Appleby, before Oliver Cromwell at Lance&s;ton, Scarbo|rough, Worce&s;ter, and We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, with many other
<PB N="xl" REF="037441_0039_100D8DAF4F894F68">places and exerci&s;es, did abundantly evidence it to his ene|mies as well as his friends.</P>
<P>But as in the primitive times &s;ome ro&s;e up again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed apo&s;tles of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, even from among tho&s;e that they had turned to the hope of the go&s;pel, and who became their greate&s;t trouble, &s;o this man of God had his &s;hare of &s;uffering from &s;ome that were convinced by him, who through prejudice or mi&s;take ran again&s;t him as one that &s;ought dominion over con&s;cience; becau&s;e he pre&s;&s;ed, by his pre&s;ence or epi&s;tles, a ready and zealous compliance with &s;uch good and whole&s;ome things as tended to an order|ly conver&s;ation about the a&s;&s;airs of the church, and in their walking before men. That which contributed much to this ill work, was in &s;ome a begrudging of this meek man the love and e&s;teem he had and de&s;erved in the hearts of the peo|ple, and weakne&s;s in others that were taken with their ground|le&s;s &s;ugge&s;tions of impo&s;ition and blind obedience.</P>
<P>They would have had every man independent, that as he had the principle in him&s;elf, he &s;hould only &s;tand and fall to that and nobody el&s;e; not con&s;idering that the principle is one in all, and though the mea&s;ure of light or grace might differ, yet the nature of it was the &s;ame, and being &s;o they &s;truck at the &s;piritual unity, which a people guided by the &s;ame principle are naturally led into: &s;o that what is evil to one is &s;o to all, and what is virtuous, hone&s;t, and of good report to one, is &s;o to all, from the &s;en&s;e and &s;avour of the one univer&s;al principle which is common to all, and (which the di&s;affected profe&s;s to be) the root of all true chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip, and that &s;pirit into which the people of God drink, and come to be &s;piritually minded, and of one heart and one &s;oul.</P>
<P>Some weakly mi&s;took good order in the government of church-affairs for di&s;cipline in wor&s;hip, and that it was &s;o pre&s;&s;ed or recommended by him and other brethren: and they were ready to reflect the &s;ame things that di&s;&s;enters had very rea&s;onably objected upon the national churches, that have coercively pre&s;&s;ed conformity to their re&s;pective creeds and wor&s;hips: whereas the&s;e things related wholly to con|ver&s;ation, and the outward and (as I may &s;ay) civil part of the church, that men &s;hould walk up to the principles of their belief, and not be wanting in care and charity. But though &s;ome have &s;tumbled and fallen through mi&s;takes and an unrea&s;onable ob&s;tinacy even to a prejudice, yet ble&s;&s;ed be God, the generality have returned to their fir&s;t love, and
<PB N="xli" REF="037441_0040_100D8DB0EDF6EFF0">&s;een the work of the enemy, that lo&s;es no opportunity or advantage by which he may check or hinder the work of God, and di&s;quiet the peace of his church, and chill the love of his people to the truth, and one to another; and there is hope of divers that are yet at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e occa&s;ions, though there was no per&s;on the di&s;contented &s;truck &s;o &s;harply at as this good man, he bore all their weakne&s;s and prejudice, and returned not reflection for reflection: but forgave them their weak and bitter &s;peech|es, praying for them that they might have a &s;en&s;e of their hurt, and &s;ee the &s;ubtilty of the enemy to rend and divide, and return into their fir&s;t love that thought no ill.</P>
<P>And truly, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that though God had vi&s;ibly cloathed him with a divine preference and authority, and indeed his very pre&s;ence expre&s;&s;ed a religious maje&s;ty, yet he never abu&s;ed it, but held his place in the church of God with great meekne&s;s, and a mo&s;t engaging humility and moderation. For upon all occa&s;ions, like his ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, he was a &s;ervant to all, holding and exerci&s;ing his elder&s;hip in the invi&s;ible power that had gathered them, with reve|rence to the head and care over the body, and was received only in that &s;pirit and power of Chri&s;t, as the fir&s;t and chief elder in this age; who as he was therefore worthy of double honour, &s;o for the &s;ame rea&s;on it was given by the faithful of this day; becau&s;e his authority was inward and not out|ward, and that he got it and kept it by the love of God and power of an endle&s;s life. I write my knowledge and not report, and my witne&s;s is true, having been with him for weeks and months together on divers occa&s;ions, and tho&s;e of the neare&s;t and mo&s;t exerci&s;ing nature, and that by night and by day, by &s;ea and by land, in this and in foreign countries: and I can &s;ay I never &s;aw him out of his place, or not a match for every &s;ervice or occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>For in all things he acquitted him&s;elf like a man, yea a &s;trong man, a new and heavenly-minded man. A divine, and a naturali&s;t, and all of God Almighty's making. I have been &s;urprized at his que&s;tions and an&s;wers in natural things, that whil&s;t he was ignorant of u&s;ele&s;s and &s;ophi&s;ti|cal &s;cience, he had in him the foundation of u&s;eful and commendable knowledge, and cheri&s;hed it every-where. Civil beyond all forms of breeding in his behaviour; very temperate, eating little and &s;leeping le&s;s, though a bulky per&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus he lived and &s;ojourned among us, and as he lived
<PB N="xlii" REF="037441_0041_100D8DB4327ACE48">&s;o he died, feeling the &s;ame eternal power that had rai&s;ed and pre&s;erved him in his la&s;t moments. So full of a&s;&s;urance was he that he triumphed over death; and &s;o even to the la&s;t, as if death were hardly worth notice or a mention: re|commending to &s;ome with him the di&s;patch and di&s;per&s;ion of an epi&s;tle, ju&s;t before written to the churches of Chri&s;t, throughout the world, and his own books; but above all, friends, and of all friends tho&s;e in Ireland and America, twice over: &s;aying, Mind poor friends in Ireland and America.</P>
<P>And to &s;ome that came in and inquired how he found him&s;elf, he an&s;wered, <Q>Never heed, the Lord's power is over all weakne&s;s and death, the Seed reigns, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord:</Q> which was about four or five hours before his departure out of this world. He was at the great meeting near Lombard-&s;treet on the fir&s;t day of the week, and it was the third following about ten at night when he left us, being at the hou&s;e of H. Goldney in the &s;ame court. In a good old age he went, after having lived to &s;ee his childrens children to &s;everal generations in the truth. He had the comfort of a &s;hort illne&s;s, and the ble&s;&s;ing of a clear &s;en&s;e to the la&s;t; and we may truly &s;ay with a man of God of old, that "being dead, he yet &s;peaketh;" and though ab&s;ent in body, he is pre&s;ent in Spirit; neither time nor place being able to in|terrupt the communion of &s;aints, or di&s;&s;olve the fellow&s;hip of the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t. His works prai&s;e him, becau&s;e they are to the prai&s;e of him that worked by him; for which his memorial is and &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed. I have done, as to this part of my preface, when I have left this &s;hort epitaph to his name: <Q>Many &s;ons have done virtuou&s;ly in this day, but, dear GEORGE, thou excelle&s;t them all.</Q></P>
<P>And now, Friends, you that profe&s;s to walk in the way this ble&s;&s;ed man was &s;ent of God to turn us into, &s;uffer I be&s;eech you the word of exhortation, as well fathers as children, and elders as young men. The glory of this day, and foundation of the hope that has not made us a&s;hamed &s;ince we were a people, you know is that ble&s;&s;ed principle of light and life of Chri&s;t, which we profe&s;s, and direct all people to, as the great in&s;trument and agent of man's con|ver&s;ion to God: it was by this we were fir&s;t touched, and effectually enlightened, as to our inward &s;tate; which put us upon the con&s;ideration of our latter end, cau&s;ing us to &s;et the Lord before our eyes, and to number our days, that we might apply our hearts to wi&s;dom. In that day we
<PB N="xliii" REF="037441_0042_100D8DB5CFBAEE88">judged not after the &s;ight of the eye, or after the hearing of the ear, but according to the light and &s;en&s;e this ble&s;&s;ed principle gave us; we judged and acted in reference to Things and Per&s;ons, our&s;elves and others, yea, towards God our Maker. For being quickened by it in our inward man, we could ea&s;ily di&s;cern the difference of things, and feel what was right, and what was wrong, and what was fit, and what not, both in reference to religion and civil con|cerns. That being the ground of the fellow&s;hip of all &s;aints, it was in that our fellow&s;hip &s;tood. In this we de&s;ired to have a &s;en&s;e one of another, acted towards one another and all me, in love, faithfulne&s;s, and fear.</P>
<P>In the feeling of the motions of this principle we drew near to the Lord, and waited to be prepared by it, that we might feel tho&s;e drawings and movings, before we approach|ed the Lord in prayer, or opened our mouths in mini&s;try. And in our beginning and ending with this, &s;tood our com|fort, &s;ervice, and edification. And as we ran fa&s;ter, or fell &s;hort, we made burthens for our&s;elves to bear; our &s;ervices finding in our&s;elves a rebuke, in&s;tead of an acceptance; and in lieu of "Well done," <Q>Who hath required this at your hands?</Q> In that day we were an exerci&s;ed people, our very countenances and deportment declared it.</P>
<P>Care for others was then much upon us, as well as for our&s;elves, e&s;pecially the young convinced. Often had we the burthen of the word of the Lord to our neighbours, relations, and acquaintance, and &s;ometimes &s;trangers al&s;o: we were in travail for one another's pre&s;ervation; not &s;eek|ing, but &s;hunning occa&s;ions of any coldne&s;s or mi&s;under|&s;tanding, treating one another as tho&s;e that believed and felt God pre&s;ent; which kept our conver&s;ation innocent, &s;erious, and weighty, guarding our&s;elves again&s;t the cares and friend|&s;hips of the world. We held the truth in the Spirit of it, and not in our own &s;pirits, or after our own will and af|fections. They were bowed and brought into &s;ubjection, in|&s;omuch that it was vi&s;ible to them that knew us, we did not think our&s;elves at our own di&s;po&s;al, to go where we li&s;t, or &s;ay or do what we li&s;t, or when we li&s;t. Our liberty &s;tood in the liberty of the Spirit of truth; and no plea&s;ure, no pro&s;it, no fear, no favour could draw us from this retired, &s;trict, and watchful &s;rame. We were &s;o far from &s;eeking occa&s;ions of company, that we avoided them what we could, pur&s;uing our own bu&s;ine&s;s with moderation, in&s;tead of meddling with other people's unnece&s;&s;arily.</P>
<P><PB N="xliv" REF="037441_0043_100D8DB7F894F858">
Our words were few and &s;avoury, our looks compo&s;ed and weighty, and our whole deportment very ob&s;ervable. True it is, that this retired and &s;trict &s;ort of life from the liberty of the conver&s;ation of the world, expo&s;ed us to the cen&s;ures of many, as humouri&s;ts, conceited, and &s;elf-righte|ous per&s;ons, &amp;c. But it was our pre&s;ervation from many &s;nares, to which others were continually expo&s;ed by the pre|valency of the lu&s;t of the eye, the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, and the pride of life, that wanted no occa&s;ions or temptations to ex|cite them abroad in the conver&s;e of the world.</P>
<P>I cannot forget the humility and cha&s;te zeal of that day. O how con&s;tant at meetings, how retired in them, how firm to truth's life, as well as truth's principles, and how intire and united in oar communion, as indeed became tho&s;e that profe&s;s one head, even Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord!</P>
<P>This being the te&s;timony and example the man of God before-mentioned was &s;ent to declare and leave among&s;t us, and we having embraced the &s;ame as the merciful vi&s;itation of God to us, the word of exhortation at this time is, that we continue to be found in the way of this te&s;timony with all zeal and integrity, and &s;o much the more by how much the day draweth near.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, as to you, my beloved and much honoured brethren in Chri&s;t that are in the exerci&s;e of the mini&s;try: O feel life in the mini&s;try! Let life be your commi&s;&s;ion, your well-&s;pring and trea&s;ury in all &s;uch occa&s;ions; el&s;e you well know there can be no begetting to God, &s;ince no|thing can quicken or make people alive to God, but the life of God: and it mu&s;t be a mini&s;try in and from life that en|livens any people to God. We have &s;een the fruit of all other mini&s;tries by the few that are turned from the evil of their ways. It is not our parts or memory, the repetition of former openings in our own will and time, that will do God's work. A dry doctrinal mini&s;try, however &s;ound in words, can reach but the ear, and is but a dream at the be&s;t: there is another &s;oundne&s;s, that is &s;ounde&s;t of all, viz. Chri&s;t the power of God. This is the key of David, that opens, and none &s;huts; and &s;huts, and none can open; as the oil to the lamp and the &s;oul to the body, &s;o is that to the be&s;t of words. Which made Chri&s;t to &s;ay, <Q>My words they are &s;pirit, and they are life;</Q> that is, they are from life, and therefore they make you alive that receive them. If the di&s;ciples, that had lived with Je&s;us, were to &s;tay at Jeru&s;alem till they received it; &s;o mu&s;t we wait to receive
<PB N="xlv" REF="037441_0044_100D8DB9D183D360">before we mini&s;ter, if we will turn people from darkne&s;s to light, and from Satan's power to God.</P>
<P>I fervently bow my knees to the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that you may always be like-minded, that you may ever wait reverently for the coming and open|ing of the word of life, and attend upon it in your mini&s;try and &s;ervice, that you may &s;erve God in his Spirit. And be it little, or be it much, it is well; for much is not too much, and the lea&s;t is enough, if from the motion of God's Spirit; and without it, verily, never &s;o little is too much, becau&s;e to no profit.</P>
<P>For it is the Spirit of the Lord immediately, or through the mini&s;try of his &s;ervants, that teacheth his people to profit; and to be &s;ure, &s;o far as we take him along with us in our &s;ervices, &s;o far are we profitable, and no farther. For if it be the Lord that mu&s;t work all things in us, and for our|&s;elves, much more is it the Lord that mu&s;t work in us for the conver&s;ion of others. If therefore it was once a cro&s;s to us to &s;peak, though the Lord required it at our hands, let it never be &s;o to be &s;ilent, when he does not.</P>
<P>It is one of the mo&s;t dreadful &s;ayings in the Revela|tions, That he that adds to the words of the prophecy of this book, God will add the plagues written in this book. To keep back the coun&s;el of God, is as terrible; for he that takes away from the words of the prophecy of this book, God &s;hall take away his part out of the book of life. And truly it has great caution in it to tho&s;e that u&s;e the name of the Lord, to be well a&s;&s;ured the Lord &s;peaks, that they may not be found of the number of tho&s;e that add to the words of the te&s;timony of prophecy which the Lord giveth them to bear; nor yet to mince or dimini&s;h the &s;ame, both being &s;o very offen&s;ive to God.</P>
<P>Wherefore, brethren, let us be careful neither to out-go our guide, nor yet loiter behind him; &s;ince he that makes ha&s;te may mi&s;s his way, and he that &s;tays behind lo&s;e his guide: for even tho&s;e that have received the word of the Lord had need wait for wi&s;dom, that they may &s;ee how to divide the word aright; which plainly implieth, that it is po&s;&s;ible for one that hath received the word of the Lord to mi&s;s in the divi&s;ion and application of it, which mu&s;t come from an impatiency of &s;pirit, and a &s;elf-working; which makes an un&s;ound and dangerous mixture, and will hardly beget a right-minded living people to God.</P>
<P>I am earne&s;t in this, above all other con&s;iderations, as
<PB N="xlvi" REF="037441_0045_100D8DBC49D78030">to publick brethren, well knowing how much it concerns the pre&s;ent and future &s;tate and pre&s;ervation of the church of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that has been gathered and built up by a living and powerful mini&s;try, that the mini&s;try be held, pre|&s;erved, and continued in the manife&s;tations, motions, and &s;upplies of the &s;ame life and power from time to time.</P>
<P>And where-ever it is ob&s;erved that any one does mini&s;ter more from gifts and parts than life and power, though they have an enlightened and doctrinal under&s;tanding, let them in time be advi&s;ed and admoni&s;hed for their pre&s;ervation; becau&s;e in&s;en&s;ibly &s;uch will come to depend upon &s;elf-&s;uffi|ciency, to for&s;ake Chri&s;t the living fountain, and to hew out unto them&s;elves ci&s;terns that will hold no living waters, and by degrees draw others from waiting upon the gift of God in them&s;elves, and to feel it in others, in order to their &s;trength and refre&s;hment, to wait upon them, and to turn from God to man again, and &s;o to make &s;hipwreck of the faith once delivered to the Saints, and of a good con&s;cience towards God; which are only kept by that divine gift of life that begat the one and wakened and &s;anctified the other in the beginning.</P>
<P>Nor is it enough that we have known the divine gift, and in it have reached to the &s;pirits in pri&s;on, and been the in|&s;truments of the convincing of others of the way of God, if we keep not as low and poor in our&s;elves, and as depend|ing upon the Lord as ever; &s;ince no memory, no repetitions of former openings, revelations, or enjoyments will bring a &s;oul to God, or afford bread to the hungry, or water to the thir&s;ty, unle&s;s life go with what we &s;ay, and that mu&s;t be waited for.</P>
<P>O that we may have no other fountain, treafury, or de|pendance! that none may pre&s;ume at any rate to act of them&s;elves for God; becau&s;e they have long acted from God; that we may not &s;upply want of waiting with our own wi&s;dom, or think that we may take le&s;s care and more liberty in &s;peaking than formerly; and that where we do not feel the Lord by his power to open us and enlarge us, what|ever be the expectation of the people or has been our cu&s;|tomary &s;upply and character, we may not exceed or &s;ill up the time with our own.</P>
<P>I hope we &s;hall ever remember who it was that &s;aid, "Of your&s;elves ye can do nothing;" our &s;ufficiency is in Him: and if we are not to &s;peak our own words, or take thought what we &s;hould &s;ay to men in our defence when
<PB N="xlvii" REF="037441_0046_100D8DBF4017D590">expo&s;ed for our te&s;timony, &s;urely we ought to &s;peak none of our own words, or take thought what we &s;hall &s;ay in our te&s;timony and mini&s;try in the name of the Lord to the &s;ouls of the people; for then of all times, and of all other occa|&s;ions, &s;hould it be fulfilled in us; <Q>for it is not you that &s;peak, but the Spirit of my Father that &s;peaketh in you.</Q></P>
<P>And indeed the mini&s;try of the Spirit mu&s;t and does keep its analogy and agreement with the birth of the Spirit; that as no man can inherit the kingdom of God unle&s;s he be born of the Spirit, &s;o no mini&s;try can beget a &s;oul to God, but that which is from the Spirit. For this, as I &s;aid before, the di&s;ciples waited before they went forth, and in this our elder brethren, and me&s;&s;engers of God in our day, waited, vi&s;ited, and reached to us. And having begun in the Spi|rit, let none ever hope or &s;eek to be made perfect in the fle&s;h: for what is the fle&s;h to the &s;pirit, or the chaff to the wheat? And if we keep in the &s;pirit, we &s;hall keep in the unity of it, which is the ground of true fellow&s;hip. For by drinking into that one Spirit, we are made one people to God, and by it we are continued in the unity of the faith and the bond of peace. No envying, no bitterne&s;s, no &s;trife can have place with us. We &s;hall watch always for good, and not for evil over one another, and rejoice exceed|ingly, and not begrudge at one another's increa&s;e in the riches of the grace with which God repleni&s;heth his faithful &s;ervants.</P>
<P>And, brethren, as to you is committed the di&s;pen&s;ation of the oracles of God, which give you frequent opportunities and great place with the people among whom you travel, I be&s;eech you that you would not think it &s;ufficient to declare the word of life in their a&s;&s;emblies, however edifying and comfortable &s;uch opportunities may be to you and them; but as was the practice of the man of God before-mentioned in great mea&s;ure, when among us, inquire the &s;tate of the &s;everal churches you vi&s;it, who among them are afflicted or &s;ick, who are tempted, if any are unfaithful or ob&s;timate, and endeavour to i&s;&s;ue tho&s;e things in the wi&s;dom and power of God, which will be a glorious crown upon your mini&s;try. As that prepares your way in the hearts of the people to re|ceive you as men of God, &s;o it gives you credit with them to do them good by your advice in other re&s;pects. The afflicted will be comforted by you, the tempted &s;trengthen|ed, the &s;ick refre&s;hed, the unfaithful convicted and re&s;tored, and &s;uch as are ob&s;tinate &s;oftened and &s;itted for reconcilia|tion
<PB N="xlviii" REF="037441_0047_100D8DC0D3FED5E0">which is clenching the nail, and applying and fa&s;tening the general te&s;timony by that particular care of the &s;everal branches of it, in reference to them more immediately con|cerned in it.</P>
<P>For though good and wi&s;e men and elders too may re|&s;ide in &s;uch places, who are of worth and importance in the general and in other places, yet it does not always follow that they may have the room they de&s;erve in the hearts of the people they live among, or &s;ome particular occa&s;ion may make it unfit for him or them to u&s;e that authority; but you that travel as God's me&s;&s;engers, if they receive you in the greater, &s;hall they refu&s;e you in the le&s;s? And if they own the general te&s;timony, can they with&s;tand the particular application of it in their own ca&s;es? Thus ye will &s;hew your&s;elves workmen indeed, and carry your bu&s;i|ne&s;s before you, to the prai&s;e of his name that hath called you from darkne&s;s to light, that you might turn others from Satan's power unto God and his kingdom which is within. And oh! that there were more of &s;uch faithful labourers in the vineyard of the Lord! never more need &s;ince the day of God!</P>
<P>Wherefore I cannot but cry and call aloud to you, that have been long profe&s;&s;ors of the truth, and know the truth in the convincing power of it, and have had a &s;ober con|ver&s;ation among men, yet content your&s;elves only to know truth for your&s;elves; to go to meetings, and exerci&s;e an or|dinary charity in the church and an hone&s;t behaviour in the world, and limit your&s;elves within tho&s;e bounds, feeling little or no concern upon your &s;pirits for the glory of the Lord in the pro&s;perity of his truth in the earth, more than to be glad that others &s;ucceed in &s;uch &s;ervice; ari&s;e ye in the name and power of the Lord Je&s;us! behold how white the fields are unto harve&s;t in this and other nations, and how few able and faithful labourers there are to work therein! your country folks, neighbours, and kindred want to know the Lord and his truth, and to walk in it. Does nothing lie at your door upon their account? Search and &s;ee, and lo&s;e no time, I be&s;eech you, for the Lord is at hand. I do not judge you; there is one that judgeth all men, and his judgment is true: you have mightily increa&s;ed in your out|ward &s;ub&s;tance, may you equally increa&s;e in your inward riches, and do good with both while you have a day to do good. Your enemies would once have taken what you had from you for his name's take in whom you have believed,
<PB N="xlix" REF="037441_0048_100D8DC292F90288">wherefore he has given you much of the world in the face of your enemies. But oh! let it be your &s;ervant and not your ma&s;ter, your diver&s;ion rather than your bu&s;ine&s;s! let the Lord be chiefly in your eye, and ponder your ways, and &s;ee if God has nothing more for you to do; and if you find your&s;elves &s;hort in your account with him, then wait for his preparation, and be ready to receive the word of command, and be not weary of well-doing when you have put your hand to the plough; and a&s;&s;uredly you &s;hall reap, if you faint not, the fruit of your heavenly labour in God's everla&s;ting kingdom.</P>
<P>And you, young convinced ones, be you intreated and exhorted to a diligent and cha&s;te waiting upon God in the way of his ble&s;&s;ed manife&s;tation and appearance of him&s;elf to you. Look not out but within; let not another's liberty be your &s;nare: neither act by imitation, but &s;en&s;e and feel|ing of God's power in your&s;elves: cru&s;h not the tender bud|dings of it in your &s;ouls, nor over-run in your de&s;ires and your warmne&s;s of affections the holy and gentle motions of it. Remember it is a &s;till voice that &s;peaks to us in this day, and that it is not to be heard in the noi&s;es and hurries of the mind, but is di&s;tinctly under&s;tood in a retired frame. Je&s;us loved and cho&s;e out &s;olitudes, often going to moun|tains, to gardens, and &s;ea-&s;ides, to avoid crowds and hur|ries, to &s;hew his di&s;ciples it was good to be &s;olitary and &s;it loo&s;e to the world. Two enemies lie near your &s;tate, Ima|gination and Liberty; but the plain, practical, living, holy truth, that has convinced you will pre&s;erve you, if you mind it in your&s;elves, and bring all thoughts, imaginations, and affections to the te&s;t of it, to &s;ee if they are wrought in God, or of the enemy, or your own &s;elves: &s;o will a true ta&s;te, di&s;cerning, and judgment be pre&s;erved to you, of what you &s;hould do and leave undone: and in your dili|gence and faithfulne&s;s in this way you will come to inherit &s;ub&s;tance, and Chri&s;t, the eternal wi&s;dom, will fill your trea&s;ury. And when you are converted, as well as convin|ced, then confirm your brethren, and be ready to every good word and work that the Lord &s;hall call you to, that you may be to his prai&s;e who has cho&s;en you to be partakers with the Saints in light of a kingdom that cannot be &s;haken, an inheritance incorruptible, in eternal habitations.</P>
<P>And now, as for you that are the children of God's peo|ple, a great concern is upon my &s;pirit for your good, and often are my knees bowed to the God of your fathers for
<PB N="l" REF="037441_0049_100D8DC5CF05DB10">you, that you may come to be partakers of the &s;ame divine life and power, that has been the glory of this day, that a generation you may be to God, a holy nation and a pecu|liar people, zealous of good works, when all our heads are laid in the du&s;t. Oh! you young men and women, let it not &s;uffice you that you are the children of the people of the Lord! you mu&s;t al&s;o be born again if you will inherit the kingdom of God! Your fathers are but &s;uch after the fle&s;h, and could but beget you into the likene&s;s of the fir&s;t Adam; but you mu&s;t be begotten into the likene&s;s of the &s;econd Adam by a &s;piritual generation. And therefore look carefully about you, O ye children of the children of God, con&s;ider your &s;tanding, and &s;ee what you are in relation to this divine kindred, family, and birth! Have you obeyed the light, and received and walked in the Spirit, that is the incorruptible &s;eed of the word and kingdom of God, of which you mu&s;t be born again? God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons: the father cannot &s;ave or an&s;wer for the child, the child for the father, <Q>but in the &s;in thou &s;inne&s;t thou &s;halt die, and in the righteou&s;ne&s;s thou doe&s;t through Chri&s;t Je&s;us thou &s;halt live;</Q> for it is the willing and obedient that &s;hall eat the good of the land.</P>
<P>Be not deceived, God is not mocked, &s;uch as all nations and people &s;ow, &s;uch &s;hall they reap at the hand of the ju&s;t God. And then your many and great privileges above the children of other people will add weight in the &s;cale again&s;t you, if you choo&s;e not the way of the Lord; for you have had line upon line, and precept upon precept, and not only good doctrine but good example; and which is more, you have been turned to and acquainted with a principle in your&s;elves which others have been ignorant of, and you know you may be as good as you plea&s;e, without the fear of frowns and blows, or being turned out of doors, and for|&s;aken of father and mother for God's &s;ake and his holy re|ligion, as has been the ca&s;e of &s;ome of your fathers in the day they fir&s;t entered into this holy path: and if you, after hearing and &s;eeing the wonders that God has wrought in the deliverance and pre&s;ervation of them through a &s;ea of troubles, and the manifold temporal as well as &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings that he has filled them with in the &s;ight of their enemies. &s;hould neglect or turn your backs upon &s;o great and &s;o near a &s;alvation, you would not only be mo&s;t un|grateful children to God and them, but mu&s;t expect that God will call the children of tho&s;e that know him not to
<PB N="li" REF="037441_0050_100D8DC7F7750580">take the crown out of your hands, and that your lot will be a dreadful judgment at the hand of the Lord. But oh! that it may never be &s;o with any of you! The Lord forbid, &s;aith my &s;oul.</P>
<P>Wherefore, O ye young men and women, look to the rock of your fathers; choo&s;e the God of your fathers: there is no other God but him, no other light but his, no other grace but his, nor Spirit but his to convince you, quicken and comfort you, to lead, guide, and pre&s;erve you to God's everla&s;ting kingdom; &s;o will you be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors as well as profe&s;&s;ors of the truth, embracing it not only by education but judgment and conviction, from a &s;en&s;e begotten in your &s;ouls through the operation of the eternal Spirit and power of God in your hearts, by which you may come to be the &s;eed of Abraham through faith, and the circumci&s;ion not made with hands, and &s;o heirs of the promi&s;e made to the fathers of an incorruptible crown: that, as I &s;aid before, a generation you may be to God, holding up the profe&s;&s;ion of the ble&s;&s;ed truth in the life and power of it. For forma|lity in religion is nau&s;eous to God and good men; and the more &s;o, where any form or appearance has been new and peculiar, and begun and practi&s;ed upon a principle with an uncommon zeal and &s;trictne&s;s. Therefore, I &s;ay, for you to fall flat and formal, and continue the profe&s;&s;ion without that &s;alt and &s;avour by which it is come to obtain a good report among men, is not to an&s;wer God's love, nor your parents care, nor the mind of truth in your&s;elves, nor in tho&s;e that are without; who though they will not obey the truth, have &s;ight and &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ee if they do that make a profe&s;&s;ion of it. For where the divine virtue of it is not felt in the &s;oul, and waited for, and lived in, imperfec|tions will quickly break out, and &s;hew them&s;elves, and de|tect the unfaithfulne&s;s of &s;uch per&s;ons, and that their in&s;ides are not &s;ea&s;oned with the nature of that holy principle which they profe&s;s.</P>
<P>Wherefore, dear children, let me intreat you to &s;hut your eyes at the temptations and allurements of this low and pe|ri&s;hing world, and not &s;uffer your affections to be capti|vated by tho&s;e lu&s;ts and vanities that your fathers, for truth's &s;ake, long &s;ince turned their backs upon: but as you be|lieve it to be the truth, receive it into your hearts, that you may become the children of God: &s;o that it may never be &s;aid of you as the evangeli&s;t writes of the Jews of his time, that Chri&s;t the true light came to his own, but his own re|ceived
<PB N="lii" REF="037441_0051_100D8DC9936B8AD8">him not; but to as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the <Q>children of God; which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God.</Q> A mo&s;t clo&s;e and com|prehen&s;ive pa&s;&s;age to this occa&s;ion: you exactly and pecu|liarly an&s;wer to tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ing Jews, in that you bear the name of God's people, by being the children and wearing the form of God's people: &s;o that he by his light in you may be &s;aid to come to his own, and if you obey it not, but turn your back upon it, and walk after the vanities of your minds, you will be of tho&s;e that receive him not, which I pray God may never be your ca&s;e and judgment; but that you may be thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the many and great obligations you lie under to the Lord for his love, and your parents for their care; and with all your heart, and all your &s;oul, and all your &s;trength, turn to the Lord, to his gift and Spirit in you, and hear his voice and obey it, that you may &s;eal to the te&s;timony of your fathers by the truth and evidence of your own experience; that your childrens children may ble&s;s you, and the Lord for you, as tho&s;e that delivered a faithful example, as well as record of the truth of God unto them. So will the grey hairs of your dear parents yet alive go down to the grave with joy, to &s;ee you the po&s;terity of truth, as well as theirs, and that not only their natures but Spirit &s;hall live in you when they are gone.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this preface with a few words to tho&s;e that are not of our communion, into who&s;e hands this may come, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of our own nation.</P>
<P>Friends, as you are the &s;ons and daughters of Adam, and my brethren after the fle&s;h, often and earne&s;t have been my de&s;ires and prayers to God on your behalf, that you may come to know him that has made you to be your Redeemer and Re&s;torer to the image, that through &s;in you have lo&s;t, by the power and Spirit of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom he hath given for the light and life of the world. And O that you, who are called Chri&s;tians, would receive him into your heart! for there it is you want him, and at that door he &s;tands knocking, that you &s;hould let him in, but you do not open him; you are full of other gue&s;ts, &s;o that a manger is his lot among you now, as well as of old; yet you are full of profe&s;&s;ion, as were the Jews when he came among them, who knew him not, but rejected and
<PB N="liii" REF="037441_0052_100D8DCB35DA25E8">evilly intreated him. So that if you come not to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion and experience of what you profe&s;s, all your forma|lity in religion will &s;tand you in no &s;tead in the day of God's judgment.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you ponder with your&s;elves your eternal con|dition, and &s;ee what title, what ground and foundation, you have for your chri&s;tianity: if more than a profe&s;&s;ion, and an hi&s;torical belief of the go&s;pel. Have you known the bapti&s;m of fire and the Holy Gho&s;t, and the fan of Chri&s;t that winnows away the chaff, the carnal lu&s;ts and af|fections? That divine leaven of the kingdom, that, being received, leavens the whole lump of man, &s;anctifying him throughout in body, &s;oul, and &s;pirit? If this be not the ground of your confidence, you are in a mi&s;erable e&s;tate.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, perhaps, that though you are &s;inners, and live in the daily commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, and are not &s;anctified, as I have been &s;peaking, yet you have faith in Chri&s;t, who has borne the cur&s;e for you, and in him you are complete by faith; his righteou&s;ne&s;s being imputed to you.</P>
<P>But my friends, let me intreat you not to deceive your|&s;elves in &s;o important a point as is that of your immortal &s;ouls. If you have true faith in Chri&s;t, your faith will make you clean, it will &s;anctify you; for the &s;aints faith was their victory: by this they overcame &s;in within and &s;inful men without. And if thou art in Chri&s;t, thou walk|e&s;t not after the fle&s;h, but after the Spirit, who&s;e fruits are manife&s;t. Yea thou art a new creature, new made, new fa|&s;hioned after God's will and mould: old things are done away, and behold all things are become new: new love, de&s;ires, will, affections, and practices. It is not any longer thou that live&s;t, thou di&s;obedient, carnal, worldly one; but it is Chri&s;t liveth in thee, and to live is Chri&s;t, and to die is thy eternal gain; becau&s;e thou art a&s;&s;ured, "That thy corruptible &s;hall put on incorruption, and thy mortal im|mortality;" and that thou ha&s;t a glorious hou&s;e eternal in the heavens, that will never wax old or pa&s;s away. All this follows being in Chri&s;t, as the &s;en&s;ation of heat follows fire, and light the &s;un.</P>
<P>Therefore have a care how you pre&s;ume to rely upon &s;uch a notion, as that you are in Chri&s;t whil&s;t in your old fallen nature. For "what communion hath light with dark|ne&s;s, or Chri&s;t with Belial?" Hear what the beloved di&s;ci|ple tells you; "If we &s;ay we have fellow&s;hip with God, and walk in darkne&s;s, we lie, and do not the truth." That is,
<PB N="liv" REF="037441_0053_100D8DCD5A25D900">if we go on in a &s;inful way, are captivated by our carnal affections, and are not converted to God, we walk in dark|ne&s;s, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly have any fellow&s;hip with God. Chri&s;t cloaths them with his righteou&s;ne&s;s, that receive his grace in their hearts, and deny them&s;elves, and take up his cro&s;s daily, and follow him. Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s makes men inwardly holy, of holy minds, wills, and practices. It is neverthele&s;s Chri&s;t's becau&s;e we have it; for it is ours not by nature, but by faith and adoption: it is the gift of God: but &s;till, though not ours as of or from our&s;elves, for in that &s;en&s;e it is Chri&s;t's, for it is of and from him, yet it is ours, and mu&s;t be ours in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, efficacy, and en|joyment, to do us any good, or Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s will profit us nothing. It was after this manner that he was made to the primitive Chri&s;tians, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctifica|tion, ju&s;tification, and redemption; and if ever you will have the comfort, kernel, and marrow of the chri&s;tian reli|gion, thus you mu&s;t come to learn and obtain it.</P>
<P>Now my friends, by what you have read, and will read in what follows, you may perceive that God has vi&s;ited a poor people among you with this &s;aving knowledge and te&s;|timony; whom he has upheld and increa&s;ed to this day, notwith&s;tanding the fierce oppo&s;ition they have met withal. De&s;pi&s;e not the meanne&s;s of this appearance: It was, and yet is, we know, a day of &s;mall things, and of &s;mall ac|count with too many; and many hard and ill names are given to it; but it is of God, it came from him, becau&s;e it leads to him. This we know, but we cannot make another know it as we know it, unle&s;s he will take the &s;ame way to know it that we took. The world talks of God; but what do they do? They pray for power, but reject the principle in which it is. If you would know God, and wor&s;hip and &s;erve God as you &s;hould do, you mu&s;t come to the means he has ordained and given for that purpo&s;e. Some &s;eek it in books, &s;ome in learned men; but what they look for is in them&s;elves, yet they overlook it. The voice is too &s;till, the &s;eed too &s;inall, and the light &s;hineth in darkne&s;s. They are abroad, and &s;o cannot divide the &s;poil; but the woman, that lo&s;t her &s;ilver, found it at home, after &s;he had lighted her candle and &s;wept her hou&s;e. Do you &s;o too, and you &s;hall find what Pilate wanted to know, viz. truth.</P>
<P>The light of Chri&s;t within, who is the light of the world, and &s;o a light to you, that tells you the truth of your con|dition, leads all that take heed unto it out of darkne&s;s into
<PB N="lv" REF="037441_0054_100D8DD024E3E4B8">God's marvellous light; for light grows upon the obedient. It is &s;own for the righteous, and their way is a &s;hining light, that &s;hines forth more and more to the perfect day.</P>
<P>Wherefore, O friends, turn in, turn in, I be&s;eech you! Where is the poi&s;on, there is the antidote: there you want Chri&s;t, and there you mu&s;t find him; and ble&s;&s;ed be God, there you may find him. "Seek and you &s;hall find," I te&s;tify for God: but then you mu&s;t &s;eek aright with your whole heart, as men that &s;eek for their lives, yea, for their eternal lives: diligently, humbly, patiently, as tho&s;e that can ta&s;te no plea&s;ure, comfort, or &s;atisfaction in any thing el&s;e, unle&s;s you find him whom your &s;ouls want, and de&s;ire to know and love above all. O it is a travel, a &s;piritual travel! let the carnal profane world think and &s;ay as it will. And through this path you mu&s;t walk to the city of God, that has eternal foundations, if ever you will come there.</P>
<P>Well! and what does this ble&s;&s;ed light do for you? Why, 1. It &s;ets all your &s;ins in order before you: it detects the &s;pirit of this world in all its baits and allurements, and &s;hows how man came to fall from God, and the fallen e&s;tate he is in. 2. It begets a &s;en&s;e and &s;orrow, in &s;uch as believe in it, for this fearful lap&s;e. You will then &s;ee him di&s;tinctly whom you have pierced, and all the blows and wounds you have given him by your di&s;obedience; and how you have made him to &s;erve with your &s;ins, and you will weep and mourn for it, and your &s;orrow will be a godly &s;orrow. 3. After this it will bring you to the holy watch, to take care that you do &s;o no more, that the enemy &s;urpri&s;e you not again: then thoughts, as well as words and works, will come to judgment, which is the way of holine&s;s, in which the redeemed of the Lord do walk. Here you will come to love God above all, and your neighbours as your&s;elves. Nothing hurts, nothing harms, nothing makes afraid on this holy mountain: now you come to be Chri&s;t's indeed, for you are his in nature and &s;pirit, and not your own. And when you are thus Chri&s;t's, then Chri&s;t is your's, and not before: and here communion with the Father and with the Son you will know, and the efficacy of the blood of clean&s;|ing, even the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that immaculate Lamb, which &s;peaketh better things than the blood of Abel, and which clean&s;eth from all &s;in the con&s;ciences of tho&s;e that, through the living Faith, come to be &s;prinkled with it from dead works to &s;erve the living God.</P>
<P><PB N="lvi" REF="037441_0055_100D8DD1BA009260">
To conclude, Behold the te&s;timony and doctrine of the people called Quakers! Behold their Practice and Di&s;ci|pline! And behold the ble&s;&s;ed man and men that were &s;ent of God in this excellent work and &s;ervice! All which will be more particularly expre&s;&s;ed in the en&s;uing annals of the man of God; which I do heartily recommend to my read|er's mo&s;t &s;erious peru&s;al, and be&s;eech Almighty God that his ble&s;&s;ing may go along with it, to the convincing of many as yet &s;trangers to this holy di&s;pen&s;ation, and al&s;o to the edification of the church of God in general: who, for his manifold and repeated mercies and ble&s;&s;ings to his people, in this day of his great love, is ever worthy to have the glo|ry, honour, thank&s;giving, and renown; and be it rendered and a&s;cribed, with fear and reverence, through him in whom he is well plea&s;ed, his beloved Son and Lamb, our light and life, that &s;its with him upon the throne, world without end.

<HEAD>The TESTIMONY of MARGARET FOX, concerning her late Hu&s;band GEORGE FOX: together with a brief Account of &s;ome of his Travels, Suffer|ings, and Hard&s;hips endured for the Truth's Sake.</HEAD>
<P>IT having plea&s;ed Almighty God to take away my dear hu&s;band out of this trouble&s;ome world, who was not a man thereof, being cho&s;en out of it, and had his life and being in another region, and his te&s;timony was again&s;t the world that the deeds thereof were evil, and therefore the world hated him; &s;o I am now to give in my account and te&s;timony for my dear hu&s;band, whom the Lord hath taken unto his ble&s;&s;ed kingdom and glory: and it is before me from the Lord, and in my view, to give a relation and leave upon record the dealings of the Lord with us from the beginning.</P>
<P>He was the in&s;trument in the hand of the Lord in this pre&s;ent age, which he made u&s;e of to &s;end forth into the world to preach the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, which had been hid from many ages and generations; the Lord revealed it unto him, and made him open that new and living way that leads to life eternal, when he was but a youth and a &s;tripling. And when he declared it in his own country of Leice&s;ter|&s;hire, and in Derby&s;hire, Nottingham&s;hire, and Warwick|&s;hire, and his declaration being again&s;t the hireling-prie&s;ts and their practices, it rai&s;ed a great fury and oppo&s;ition among&s;t the prie&s;ts and people again&s;t him; yet there was always &s;ome that owned him in &s;everal places, but very few that &s;tood firm to him when per&s;ecution came on him. There was he and one other put in pri&s;on at Derby, but the other declined and left him in pri&s;on there; where he con|tinued almo&s;t a whole year, and then he was relea&s;ed out of pri&s;on, and went on with his te&s;timony abroad, and was put in pri&s;on again at Nottingham; and there he continued awhile, and after was relea&s;ed again.</P>
<P>And then he travelled on into York&s;hire, and pa&s;&s;ed up and down that great county, and &s;everal received him; as William Dew&s;bury, Richard Farn&s;worth, Thomas Aldam, and others, who all came to be faithful mini&s;ters of the Spi|rit for the Lord. And he continued in that country, and travelled through Holderne&s;s and the Woulds, and abun|dance were convinced; and &s;everal were brought to pri&s;on at York for their te&s;timony to the truth, both men and wo|men:
<PB N="lviii" REF="037441_0057_100D8DD60B9656D0">&s;o that we heard of &s;uch a people that were ri&s;en, and we did, very much inquire after them. And after awhile he travelled up farther towards the dales in York&s;hire, as Wen&s;dale and Sedbur; and among&s;t the hills, dales and mountains he came on, and convinced many of the eternal truth.</P>
<P>In the year 1652 it plea&s;ed the Lord to draw him towards us; &s;o he came on from Sedbur into We&s;tmoreland, to Fir|bank-Chapel, where John Blaykling came with him; and &s;o on to Pre&s;ton, Grarig. Kendal, Under-barrow, Poobank, Cartmel, and Staveley, and &s;o on to Swarthmore, my dwel|ling-hou&s;e, whither he brought the ble&s;&s;ed tidings of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, which I and many hundreds in the&s;e parts have cau&s;e to prai&s;e the Lord for. My then hu&s;band, Thomas Fell, was not at home at that time, but gone the Wel&s;h circuit, being one of the judges of a&s;&s;ize; and our hou&s;e being a place open to entertain mini&s;ters and religious people at, one of GEORGE FOX's friends brought him thi|ther, where he &s;taid all night: and the next day, being a lecture or a fa&s;t-day, he went to Ulver&s;ton &s;teeple-hou&s;e, but came not in till people were gathered; I and my chil|dren had been a long time there before. And when they were &s;inging before the &s;ermon he came in, and when they had done &s;inging he &s;tood up upon a &s;eat or form, and de|&s;ired "that he might have liberty to &s;peak;" and he that was in the pulpit &s;aid he might. And the fir&s;t words that he &s;poke were as followeth: <Q>He is not a Jew that is one outward. neither is that circumci&s;ion which is outward; but he is a Jew that is one inward, and that is circumci|&s;ion which is of the heart.</Q> And &s;o he went on and &s;aid <Q>that Chri&s;t was the light of the world, and lighteth every man that cometh into the world, and that by this light they mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ht be gathered to God,</Q> &amp;c. I &s;tood up in my pew, and wondered at his doctrine; for I had never heard &s;uch before. And then he went on, and opened the &s;crip|tures and &s;aid, <Q>The &s;criptures were the prophets words, and Chri&s;t's and the apo&s;tles words, and what, as they &s;poke, they enjoyed and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and had it from the Lord:" and &s;aid, "Then what had any to do with the &s;criptures, but as they came to the &s;pirit that gave them forth. You will &s;ay, Chri&s;t &s;aith this, and the apo&s;tles &s;ay this; but what can&s;t thou &s;ay? Art thou a child of light, and ha&s;t walked in the light, and what thou &s;peak|e&s;t, is it inwardly from God.</Q> &amp;c. This opened me &s;o,
<PB N="lix" REF="037441_0058_100D8DD8F03C53E0">that it cut me to the heart; and then I &s;aw clearly, we were all wrong. So I &s;at down in my pew again, and cried bit|terly; and I cried in my &s;pirit to the Lord, <Q>We are all thieves, we are all thieves, we have taken the &s;criptures in words, and know nothing of them in our&s;elves.</Q> So that &s;erved me, that I cannot well tell what he &s;poke after|wards; but he went on in declaring again&s;t the fal&s;e pro|phets, prie&s;ts, and deceivers of the people. And there was one John Sawrey, a ju&s;tice of peace, and a profe&s;&s;or, that bid the churchwarden taken him away: and he laid his hands on him &s;everal times, and took them off again, and let him alone; and then after a while he gave over, and came to our hou&s;e again that night. And he &s;poke in the family among&s;t the &s;ervants, and they were all generally con|vinced; as William Caton, Thomas Salthou&s;e, Mary A&s;kew, Anne Clayton, and &s;everal other &s;ervants. And I was &s;truck into &s;uch a &s;adne&s;s, I knew not what to do, my hu&s;band being from home. I &s;aw it was the truth, and I could not deny it; and I did, as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, "I re|ceived the truth in the love of it:" and it was opened to me &s;o clear, that I had never a tittle in my heart again&s;t it; but I de&s;ired the Lord that I might be kept in it, and then I de&s;ired no greater portion.</P>
<P>He went on to Dalton, Aldingham, Dendrum, an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ram&s;yde chapels and &s;teeple-hou&s;es, and &s;everal places up and down, and the people followed him mightily: and abundance were convinced, and &s;aw that which he &s;poke was truth, but the prie&s;ts were all in a rage. And about two weeks after James Naylor and Richard Farn&s;worth fol|lowed him and enquired him out till they came to Swarth|more, and there &s;taid awhile with me at our hou&s;e, and did me much good; for I was under great heavine&s;s and judgment. But the power of the Lord entered upon me within about three weeks that he came, and about three weeks end my hu&s;band came home; and many were in a mighty rage, and a deal of the captains and great ones of the country went to meet my then hu&s;band as he was coming home, and informed him, <Q>That a great di&s;a&s;ter was befallen among&s;t his family, and that they were witches; and that they had taken us out of our religion; and that he mu&s;t either &s;et them away, or all the country would be undone.</Q> But no weapons formed again&s;t the Lord &s;hall pro&s;per, as you may &s;ee hereafter.</P>
<P>So my hu&s;band came home greatly offended; and any
<PB N="lx" REF="037441_0059_100D8DDA8853DDD0">may think what a condition I was like to be in, that either I mu&s;t di&s;plea&s;e my hu&s;band or offend God; for he was very much troubled with us all in the hou&s;e and family, they had &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him again&s;t us. But James Nay|lor and Richard Farn&s;worth were both then at our hou&s;e, and I de&s;ired them to come and &s;peak to him; and &s;o they did very moderately and wi&s;ely: but he was at fir&s;t di&s;|plea&s;ed with them, till they told him "they came in love and good-will to his hou&s;e." And after that he had heard them &s;peak awhile he was better &s;atisfied, and they offered as if they would go away; but I de&s;ired them to &s;tay, and not to go away yet, for GEORGE FOX will come this evening. And I would have had my hu&s;band to have heard them all, and &s;atisfied him&s;elf farther about them, becau&s;e they had &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him again&s;t them of &s;uch dangerous fearful things in his coming fir&s;t home. And then he was pretty moderate and quiet, and his dinner being ready he went to it, and I went in and &s;ate me down by him. And whil&s;t I was &s;itting the power of the Lord &s;eized upon me, and he was &s;truck with amazement, and knew not what to think; but was quiet and &s;till. And the children were all quiet and &s;till, and grown &s;ober, and could not play on their mu&s;ick that they were learning; and all the&s;e things made him quiet and &s;till.</P>
<P>At night GEORGE FOX came: and after &s;upper my hu&s;band was &s;itting in the parlour, and I a&s;ked him, If GEORGE FOX might come in? And he &s;aid, Yes. So GEORGE came in without any compliment, and walked into the room, and began to &s;peak pre&s;ently; and the fa|mily, and James Naylor and Richard Farn&s;worth came all in: and he &s;poke very excellently as ever I heard him, and opened Chri&s;t's and the apo&s;tles practices, which they were in, in their day. And he opened the night of apo&s;tacy &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, and laid open the prie&s;ts and their practices in the apo&s;tacy; that if all in England had been there, I thought they could not have denied the truth of tho&s;e things. And &s;o my hu&s;band came to &s;ec clearly the truth of what he &s;poke, and was very quiet that night, &s;aid no more, and went to bed. The next morning came Lam|pit, prie&s;t of Ulver&s;ton, and got my hu&s;band into the gar|den, and &s;poke much to him there; but my hu&s;band had &s;een &s;o much the night before, that the prie&s;t got little entrance upon him. And when the prie&s;t, Lampit, was come into the hou&s;e, GEORGE &s;poke &s;harpy to him, and
<PB N="lxi" REF="037441_0060_100D8DDC1D4F8658">a&s;ked him, <Q>When God &s;poke to him, and called him to go and preach to the people?</Q> But after awhile the prie&s;t went away: this was on the &s;ixth day of the week, about the fifth month, 1652. And at our hou&s;e divers friends were &s;peaking one to another, how there were &s;everal convinced here-aways, and we could not tell where to get a meeting; my hu&s;band al&s;o being pre&s;ent, he overheard, and &s;aid of his own accord, "You may meet here if you will:" and that was the fir&s;t meeting we had that he offered of his own accord. And then notice was given that day and the next to friends, and there was a good large meeting the fir&s;t day, which was the fir&s;t meeting that was at Swarth|more, and &s;o continued there a meeting from 1652 to 1690. And my hu&s;band went that day to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and none with him but his clerk, and his groom that rid with him: and the prie&s;t and the people were all fearfully troubled; but prai&s;ed be the Lord, they never got their wills upon us to this day.</P>
<P>After a few weeks GEORGE went to Ulver&s;ton &s;teeple-hou&s;e again, and the &s;aid ju&s;tice Sawrey, with others, &s;et the rude rabble upon him, and they beat him &s;o that he fell down as in a &s;woon, and was &s;ore brui&s;ed and blackened in his body, and on his head and arms. Then my hu&s;band was not at home; but when he came home, he was di&s;|plea&s;ed that they &s;hould do &s;o, and &s;poke to ju&s;tice Sawrey, and &s;aid, "It was again&s;t law to make riots." After that he was &s;ore beat and &s;toned at Walney till he fell down, and al&s;o at Dalton was he &s;ore beat and abu&s;ed; &s;o that he had very hard u&s;age in divers places in the&s;e parts. And then when a meeting was &s;ettled here, he went again into We&s;tmoreland, and &s;ettled meetings there; and there was a great convincement, and abundance of brave mini&s;ters came out there-aways; as John Camm, John Audland, Francis Howgil, Edward Burrough, Miles Halhead, and John Blaykling, with divers others. He al&s;o went over the &s;ands to Lanca&s;ter, and Yelland, and Kellet, where Robert Wid|ders, Richard Hubberthorn, and John Law&s;on, with many others, were convinced. And about that time he was in tho&s;e parts, many prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors ro&s;e up, and fal&s;ely accu&s;ed him for bla&s;phemy, and did endeavour to take away his life, and got people to &s;wear at a &s;e&s;&s;ions at Lanca&s;ter that he had &s;poken bla&s;phemy. But my then hu&s;band and colonel We&s;t, having had &s;ome &s;ight and knowledge of the truth, with&s;tood the two per&s;ecuting ju&s;tices, John Sawrey
<PB N="lxii" REF="037441_0061_100D8DDEEDBCC550">and Thomp&s;on, and brought him off, and cleared him; for indeed he was innocent. And after the &s;e&s;&s;ions there was a great meeting in the town of Lanca&s;ter; and many of the town's people came in, and many were convinced, And thus he was up and down about Lanca&s;ter, Yelland, We&s;tmoreland, and &s;ome parts of York&s;hire, and our parts above one year; in which time there were above twenty-four mini&s;ters brought forth, that were ready to go with their te&s;timony of the eternal truth unto the world: and &s;oon after Francis Howgil and John Camm went to &s;peak to Oliver Cromwel.</P>
<P>In the year 1653 GEORGE's drawings were into Cumber|land by Milholm, Lampley, Embleton and Brigham, Pard|&s;ey and Cockermouth, where at or near Embleton he had a di&s;pute with &s;ome prie&s;ts, as Larkham and Ben&s;on, but chiefly with John Wilkin&s;on, a preacher at Embleton and Brigham; who was afterwards convinced, and owned the truth, and was a &s;erviceable mini&s;ter both in England, Ire|land and Scotland. And then he went to Coldbeck and &s;everal places, till he came to Carli&s;le, and went to their &s;teeple-hou&s;e: and they beat and abu&s;ed him, and had him before the magi&s;trates; who examined him, and put him in pri&s;on there in the common gaol among the thieves. And at the a&s;&s;izes was one Anthony Pear&s;on, who had been a ju&s;tice of peace, and was convinced at Appleby, when he was upon the bench, by James Naylor and Francis How|gil, who were then pri&s;oners there, and brought before him; &s;o Anthony Pear&s;on &s;pake to the ju&s;tices at Carli&s;le, he be|ing acquainted with them, having married his wife out of Cumberland; and after awhile they relea&s;ed him. After|wards he went into &s;everal other parts of Cumberland, and many were convinced, and owned the truth: and he gather|ed and &s;ettled meetings there among&s;t them, and up and down in &s;everal parts there in the north.</P>
<P>In the year 1654 he went &s;outhward to his own country of Leice&s;ter&s;hire, vi&s;iting friends. And then colonel Hack|er &s;ent him to Oliver Cromwel: and after his being kept pri&s;oner a while, he was brought before Oliver, and was relea&s;ed. And then he &s;tayed a while, vi&s;iting friends in London, and the meetings therein; and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed we&s;tward to Bri&s;tol, and vi&s;ited friends there: and after went into Cornwall, where they put him in pri&s;on at Launce&s;ton, and one Edward Pyot with him; where he had a bad, long impri&s;onment. When he was relea&s;ed, he pa&s;&s;ed into ma|ny
<PB N="lxiii" REF="037441_0062_100D8DE2A98AA0D8">parts in that county of Cornwall, and &s;ettled meetings there. And then he travelled through many counties, vi&s;it|ing friends and &s;ettling meetings all along: and &s;o came into the north, and to Swarthmore, and to Cumberland.</P>
<P>And &s;o for Scotland he pa&s;&s;ed in the year 1657, and there went with him Robert Widders, James Lanca&s;ter, John Grave, and others. And he travelled through many places in that nation, as Douglas, Heads, Hamilton, Gla&s;gow, and to Edinburgh, where they took him, and car|ried him before general Monk and the council, and examin|ed him, and a&s;ked him his bu&s;ine&s;s into that nation; who an&s;wered, He came to vi&s;it the &s;eed of God. And after they had threatened him, and charged him to depart their nation of Scotland, they let him go. And then he went to Linlithgow, and Stirling, and John&s;tons, and many pla|ces, vi&s;iting the people: and &s;everal were convinced. And after he had &s;taid a pretty while, and &s;ettled &s;ome meetings, he returned into Northumberland, and into the bi&s;hoprick of Durham, vi&s;iting friends and &s;ettling meetings as he went; and then returned back again to Swarthmore, and &s;taid among&s;t friends awhile, and &s;o returned &s;outh again. [In 1658 judge Fell died.]</P>
<P>And in 1660 he came out of the &s;outh into the north, and had a great general meeting about Balby in York&s;hire; and &s;o came on vi&s;iting friends in many places, till he came to Swarthmore again. And king Charles being then come in, the ju&s;tices &s;ent out warrants, and took him at Swarth|more, charging him in their warrants, that he drew away the king's liege people, to the endangering the embruing the nation in blood, and &s;ent him pri&s;oner to Lanca&s;ter ca&s;tle. And I having a great family, and he being taken in my hou&s;e, I was moved of the Lord to go to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Whitehall; and took with me a declaration, and an in|formation of our principles; and a long time, and much ado I had, to get to him. But at la&s;t, when I got to him, I told him, If he was guilty of tho&s;e things, I was guilty, for he was taken in my hou&s;e: and I gave him the paper of our principles, and de&s;ired that he would &s;et him at liberty, as he had promi&s;ed that none &s;hould &s;uffer for ten|der con&s;ciences, and we were of tender con&s;ciences, and de&s;ired nothing but the liberty of our con&s;ciences. And then with much ado, after he had been kept pri&s;oner near half a year at Lanca&s;ter, we got a habeas corpus, and re|moved him to the King's Bench, where he was relea&s;ed.
<PB N="lxiv" REF="037441_0063_100D8DE443BAE908">And then would I gladly have come home to my great fa|mily; but was bound in my &s;pirit, and could not have freedom to get away for a whole year. And the king had promi&s;ed me &s;everal times, that we &s;hould have our liberty: and then the monarchy-men ro&s;e; and then came the great and general impri&s;onment of friends the nation through: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> could I not have freedom nor liberty to come home, till we had got a general proclamation for all our friends liberty; and then I had freedom and peace to come home.</P>
<P>In 1663 he came north again, and to Swarthmore: and then they &s;ent out warrants, and took him again, and had him to Holcrof before the ju&s;tices, and tendered him the oath of allegiance, and &s;ent him pri&s;oner to Lanca&s;ter ca&s;tle. And about a month after, the ju&s;tices &s;ent for me al&s;o out of my hou&s;e, and tendered me the oath; and &s;ent me pri|&s;oner to Lanca&s;ter. And the next a&s;&s;izes they tendered the oath of allegiance and &s;upremacy again to us both, and pre|munired me: but they had mi&s;&s;ed the date and other things in his indictment, and &s;o it was qua&s;hed; but they tendered him the oath again, and kept him pri&s;oner a year and a half at Lanca&s;ter ca&s;tle. And then they &s;ent him to Scarborough ca&s;tle in York&s;hire, where they kept him pri&s;oner clo&s;e un|der the &s;oldiers mo&s;t of a year and a half; &s;o that a friend could &s;carcely have &s;poken to him; yet after that, it plea&s;ed the Lord that he was relea&s;ed. But I continued in pri&s;on, and a pri&s;oner four years at that time; and an order was pro|cured from the council, whereby I was &s;et at liberty. And in that time I went down into Cornwall with my &s;on and daughter Lower, and came back by London to the yearly meeting; and there I met with him again: And then he told me, The time was drawing towards our marriage, but he might fir&s;t go into Ireland. And a little before this time was he pri&s;oner in his own country at Leice&s;ter for awhile; and then relea&s;ed. And &s;o into Ireland he went: and I went into Kent and Su&s;&s;ex; and came back to London again; and afterward I went to the we&s;t, towards Bri&s;tol, in 1669, and there I &s;taid till he came over from Ireland, which was eleven years after my former hu&s;band's decea&s;e. In Ireland he had had a great &s;ervice for the Lord and his eternal truth among&s;t friends and many people there, but e&s;caped many dangers, and times of being taken pri&s;oner, they having lain in wait aforehand for him in many places; and being returned, at Bri&s;tol he declared his intentions of
<PB N="lxv" REF="037441_0064_100D8DE68CC220E8">marriage; and there accordingly our marriage was &s;olemni|zed: and then within ten days after I came homewards; and my hu&s;band &s;taid up and down in the countries among&s;t friends, vi&s;iting them.</P>
<P>Soon after I came home, there came another order from the council to ca&s;t me into pri&s;on again; and the &s;heriff of Lanca&s;hire &s;ent his bailiff, and pulled me out of my own hou&s;e, and had me pri&s;oner to Lanca&s;ter ca&s;tle, upon the old premunire; where I continued a whole year: and mo&s;t part of all that time I was &s;ick and weakly, and al&s;o my hu&s;band was weak and &s;ickly at that time. After awhile he recovered, and went about to get me out of pri&s;on; and a di&s;charge at la&s;t was got under the great &s;eal, and &s;o I was &s;et at liberty: and then I was to go up to London again, for my hu&s;band was intending for America; and he was full two years away before he came back again to En|gland: and arriving at Bri&s;tol, he came thence to London, and intended to have come to the middle of the nation with me. But when we came into &s;ome parts of Worce&s;ter&s;hire, they got there information of him; and one ju&s;tice Parker by his warrant &s;ent him and my &s;on Lower to Worce&s;ter gaol; and the ju&s;tices there tendered him the oath, and pre|munired him, but relea&s;ed my &s;on Lower; who &s;taid with him mo&s;t of the time he was pri&s;oner there.</P>
<P>And after &s;ome time he fell &s;ick in a long lingering &s;ick|ne&s;s, and many times was very ill; &s;o they wrote to me from London, that if I would &s;ee him alive, I might go to him; which accordingly I did. And after I had tarried &s;eventeen weeks with him at Worce&s;ter, and no di&s;charge like to be obtained for him, I went up to London, and wrote to the king an account of his long impri&s;onment, and that he was taken in his travel homewards; and that he was &s;ick and weak, and not like to live, if they kept him long there. And I went with it to Whitehall my&s;elf; and I met with the king, and gave him the paper: and he &s;aid, I mu&s;t go to the chancellor, he could do nothing in it. Then I writ al&s;o to the lord chancellor, and went to his hou&s;e, and gave him my paper, and &s;poke to him, That the king had left it wholly to him; and if he did not take pity, and relea&s;e him out of that pri&s;on. I feared he would end his days there. And the lord chancellor Finch was a very tender man, and &s;poke to the judge, who gave out an habeas corpus pre&s;ent|ly. And when we got it, we &s;ent it down to Worce&s;ter; and they would not part with him at fir&s;t, but &s;aid, he was
<PB N="lxvi" REF="037441_0065_100D8DE8AD1A95C8">premunired, and was not to go out on that manner. And then we were forced to go to judge North, and to the attor|ney-general, and we got another order, and &s;ent down from them; and with much ado, and great labour and indu&s;try of William Mead, and other friends, we got him up to London, where he appeared at We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall at the King's Bench, before judge Hales, who was a very hone&s;t, tender man; and he knew they had impri&s;oned him but in envy. So that which they had again&s;t him was read; and our coun&s;el pleaded, that he was taken up in his travel and journey; and there was but little &s;aid till he was acquitted. And this was the la&s;t pri&s;on that he was in, being freed by the court of King's Bench.</P>
<P>When he was at liberty, he recovered again; and then I was very de&s;irous to go home with him, which we did; and this was the fir&s;t time that he came to Swarthmore after we were married, and he &s;taid here about two years, and then went to London again to the yearly meeting; and after a|while went into Holland, and &s;ome parts of Germany, where he &s;taid a pretty while, and then returned to London again at the next yearly meeting. And after he had &s;taid awhile in and about London, he came into the north to Swarth|more again, and &s;taid that time nigh two years; and then he grew weakly, being troubled with pains and aches, hav|ing had many &s;ore and long travels, beatings, and hard im|pri&s;onments. But after &s;ome time he rode to York, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed on through Nottingham&s;hire and &s;everal counties, vi&s;iting friends till he came to London to the yearly meet|ing, and &s;taid there and thereabouts till he fini&s;hed his cour&s;e, and laid down his head in peace.</P>
<P>And though the Lord had provided an outward habita|tion for him, yet he was not willing to &s;tay at it, becau&s;e it was &s;o remote and far from London, where his &s;ervice mo&s;t lay. And my concern for God and his holy eternal truth was then in the north, where God had placed and &s;et me; and likewi&s;e for the ordering and governing of my children and family; &s;o that we were willing both of us to live apart &s;ome years upon God's account and his truth's &s;ervice, and to deny our&s;elves of that comfort which we might have had in being together, for the &s;ake and &s;ervice of the Lord and his truth. And if any took occa&s;ion, or judged hard of us becau&s;e of that, the Lord will judge them; for we were in|nocent. And for my own part, I was willing to make many long journeys, for taking away all occa&s;ion of evil thoughts:
<PB N="lxvii" REF="037441_0066_100D8DEBB5009E68">and though I lived two hundred miles from London, yet have I been nine times there, upon the Lord's and his truth's account; and of all the times that I was at London, this la&s;t time was mo&s;t comfortable, that the Lord was plea&s;ed to give me &s;trength and ability to travel that great journey, being &s;eventy-&s;ix years of age, to &s;ee my dear hu&s;band, who was better in his health and &s;trength than many times I had &s;een him before. I look upon it that the Lord's &s;pecial hand was in it that I &s;hould go then, for he lived but about half a year after I left him; which makes me admire the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God in ordering my journey at that time.</P>
<P>And now he hath fini&s;hed his cour&s;e and his te&s;timony, and is entered into his eternal re&s;t and felicity. I tru&s;t in the &s;ame powerful God, that his holy arm and power will carry me through, whatever he hath yet for me to do; and that he will be my &s;trength and &s;upport, and the bearer-up of my head unto the end and in the end. For I know his faithfulne&s;s and goodne&s;s, and I have experience of his love; to whom be glory and powerful dominion for ever. Amen.</P>

<P>NEITHER days nor length of time with us can wear out the memory of our dear and honoured father GEORGE FOX, whom the Lord hath taken to him&s;elf: and though his earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle be di&s;&s;olved, and mortality put off, yet we believe he has a <Q>building with God eternally in the heavens, and is entered into re&s;t,</Q> as a reward to tho&s;e great labours, hard &s;ufferings, and &s;ore trials, he patiently endured for God and his truth. Of which truth he was made an able mini&s;ter, and one, if not the fir&s;t promulgator of it in our age; who, though of no great literature, nor &s;eeming much learned as to the out|ward, being hid from the wi&s;dom of this world, yet he had the tongue of the learned, and could &s;peak a word in due &s;ea&s;on to the conditions and capacities of mo&s;t, e&s;pecially to them that were weary and wanted &s;oul's re&s;t, being deep in the divine my&s;teries of the kingdom of God. And the word of life and &s;alvation through him reached into many &s;ouls,
<PB N="lxviii" REF="037441_0067_100D8DED4D7DA4D0">whereby many were convinced of their great duty of inward retiring to wait upon God; and as they became diligent in the performance of that &s;ervice, were al&s;o rai&s;ed to be preach|ers of the &s;ame everla&s;ting go&s;pel of peace and glad tidings to others; who are as &s;eals to his mini&s;try both in this and other nations, and may po&s;&s;ibly give a more full account thereof. Howbeit we knowing his unwearied diligence, not &s;paring but &s;pending him&s;elf in the work and &s;ervice where|unto he was cho&s;en and called of God, could not but give this &s;hort te&s;timony of his faithfulne&s;s therein, and likewi&s;e of his tender love and care towards us; who as a tender father to children, in which capacity we &s;tood, being &s;o re|lated unto him, he never failed to give us his whole&s;ome coun&s;el and advice. And not only &s;o, but, as a father in Chri&s;t, he took care of the whole family and hou&s;hold of faith, which the Lord had made him an eminent over&s;eer of, and endued him with &s;uch an excellent &s;pirit of wi&s;|dom and under&s;tanding, to propo&s;e and direct helps and advantages to the well-ordering and e&s;tabli&s;hing of affairs and government in the church, as now are found very &s;er|viceable thereunto, and have greatly di&s;appointed and pre|vented the fal&s;e, loo&s;e, and libertine &s;pirit in &s;ome, who to their confu&s;ion have endeavoured, by &s;eparation and divi|&s;ion, to di&s;turb the church's peace. And although many of that &s;ort have at &s;undry times &s;hot their poi&s;onous darts at him, publickly in print, and privately other ways, yet he has always been pre&s;erved by the heavenly power of God out of the reach of their envy, and all perils and difficulties that attended on their account; who, as a &s;ixed &s;tar in the firmament of God's power, did con&s;tantly abide, and held his integrity to the la&s;t, being of a &s;weet &s;avory life, and as to conver&s;ation kept his garments clean: and though out|wardly dead yet liveth, and his memory is right precious unto us; and it is and will be to all that abide in the love of truth, and have not declined the way of it. For he was one of the Lord's worthies, valiant for the truth upon earth, not turning his back in the day of battle; but his bow &s;till abiding in its &s;trength, he, through many hard&s;hips, brought gladne&s;s and refre&s;hment to I&s;rael's camp, being a&s;&s;i&s;led by the might of that power that always put the armi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of aliens and enemies to flight. And now, having fini&s;hed his cour&s;e, is removed from us into a glorious &s;tate of immortality and bli&s;s, and is gathered unto the Lord as a &s;hock of corn in

<HEAD>An EPISTLE by way of TESTIMONY to Friends and Brethren of the Monthly and Quarterly Meetings in England, Wales, and el&s;ewhere, concerning the Decea&s;e of our faithful Brother GEORGE FOX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From our Second Day's Morning-Meeting in London, the 26th of the 11th month, 1690.</HEAD>
<P>DEAR and truly beloved friends, brethren, and &s;i&s;ters in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour, we &s;in|cerely and tenderly &s;alute you all in his free and tender love, wherewith he hath graciou&s;ly vi&s;ited us, and largely &s;hed it abroad in our &s;ouls, to our own un&s;peakable comfort and con|&s;olation, and towards his whole heritage and offspring: ble&s;|&s;ed be his pure and powerful name for evermore. And our &s;ouls do truly and fervently de&s;ire, and breathe unto the God of all our mercies, that you all may be pre&s;erved and kept truly faithful and diligent in his work and &s;ervice, ac|cording to your heavenly calling and endowments, with his light, grace, and truth unto the end of your days; as be|ing livingly engaged thereby all your appointed time to &s;erve him, and to wait till your change come; that none may neglect that true improvement of your times and talents that God has afforded you here for your eternal advantage hereaf|ter in that inheritance and life immortal that never fades away. And that the whole flock and heritage of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which he has purcha&s;ed and bought for him&s;elf with a price incorruptible, may always be pre&s;erved in his own pure love and life, &s;o as to grow, increa&s;e, and pro&s;per in the &s;ame, and thereby be kept in love, unity, and peace with one
<PB N="lxx" REF="037441_0069_100D8DF20B152498">another, as becomes his true and faithful followers, is that which our very hearts and &s;ouls de&s;ire, being often truly comforted and enlarged in the living &s;en&s;e and feeling of the increa&s;e and aboundings thereof among faithful friends and brethren.</P>
<P>And dear brethren and &s;i&s;ters, unto this our tender &s;alu|tation we are concerned, in brotherly love and true tender-heartedne&s;s, to add and impart unto you &s;ome account of the decea&s;e of our dear and elder brother in Chri&s;t, name|ly, his and his church's true and faithful &s;ervant and mini&s;|ter GEORGE FOX, whom it hath plea&s;ed the Lord to take unto him&s;elf, as he hath divers others of his faithful &s;ervants and mini&s;ters of late time; who have faithfully &s;erved out their generation, and fini&s;hed their te&s;timony and cour&s;e with joy and peace. Howbeit, O dear brethren and friends! that &s;o many worthies in I&s;rael, and &s;erviceable in&s;truments in the Lord's hand, are of late taken away and removed from us, &s;o &s;oon one after another, appears a di&s;pen&s;ation that deeply and &s;orrowfully affects us and many more, who&s;e hearts are upright and tender towards God and one to another in the truth. The con&s;ideration of the depth, weight, and meaning thereof is very weighty upon our &s;pi|rits, tho' their precious life and te&s;timony lives with us, as being of that &s;ame body, united to one head, even Je&s;us Chri&s;t; in which we &s;till, and hope ever &s;hall have &s;ecret comfort and union with them, whom the Lord has removed and taken to him&s;elf, out of their earthly tabernacles and hou&s;es, into their heavenly and everla&s;ting man&s;ions.</P>
<P>This our dear brother, GEORGE FOX, was enabled by the Lord's power to preach the truth fully and effectually in our publick meeting in White Hart Court, by Grace|church-&s;treet, London, on the 11th day of this in&s;tant 11th month, 1690: after which he &s;aid, "I am glad I was here; now I am clear, I am fully clear." He was the &s;ame day taken with &s;ome illne&s;s or indi&s;po&s;ition of body more than u&s;ual, and continued weak in body for two days after at our friend Henry Gouldney's hou&s;e in the &s;ame court, clo&s;e by the meeting-hou&s;e, in much contentment and peace, and very &s;en&s;ible to the la&s;t. In which time he mentioned divers friends, and &s;ent for &s;ome in particular; to whom he expre&s;|&s;ed his mind for the &s;preading friends books and truth in the world and through the nations thereof, as his &s;pirit in the Lord's love and power was univer&s;ally &s;et and bent for truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the making known the way thereof
<PB N="lxxi" REF="037441_0070_100D8DF4CE977170">to the nations and people afar off; &s;ignifying al&s;o to &s;ome friends, "That all is well; and the &s;eed of God reigns over all, and over death it&s;elf: that though he was weak in body, yet that the power of God is over all, and the &s;eed reigns over all di&s;orderly &s;pirits:" which were his wonted &s;en&s;ible expre&s;&s;ions, being in the living faith and &s;en&s;e thereof, which he kept to the end. And on the 13th in&s;tant, between the ninth and tenth hour of the night, he quietly departed this life in peace, being two days after the Lord enabled him to publi&s;h and preach the ble&s;&s;ed truth in the meeting as afore&s;aid. So that he clearly and evidently ended his days in his faithful te&s;timony, in perfect love and unity with his brethren, and peace and good-will to all men, being about &s;ixty and &s;ix years of age, as we under&s;tand, when he departed this life.</P>
<P>And on the &s;ixteenth of this in&s;tant, being the day ap|pointed for his funeral, a very great concour&s;e of friends and other people a&s;&s;embled at our meeting-hou&s;e in White Hart Court afore&s;aid, about the mid-day, in order to attend his body to our burying place near Bunhillfields, to be in|terred, as friends la&s;t office of love and re&s;pect due on that account. The meeting was held about two hours, with great and heavenly &s;olemnity, manife&s;tly attended with the Lord's ble&s;&s;ed power and pre&s;ence; and divers living te&s;ti|monies given from a lively remembrance and &s;en&s;e of this his dear ancient &s;ervant, his ble&s;&s;ed mini&s;try and te&s;ti|mony of the breaking forth of this go&s;pel-day; his inno|cent life, long and great travels, and labours of love in the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, for the turning and gathering many thou|&s;ands from darkne&s;s to the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the foun|dation of true faith; al&s;o of his manifold &s;ufferings, afflic|tions, and oppo&s;itions which he met withal for his faith|ful te&s;timony, both from his open adver&s;aries and fal&s;e bre|thren; and his pre&s;ervations, dominion, and deliverances out of them all by the power of God: to whom the glory and honour was and is a&s;cribed, in rai&s;ing up and pre&s;erv|ing this his faithful witne&s;s and mini&s;ter to the end of his days, who&s;e ble&s;&s;ed memorial will everla&s;ting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y remain.</P>
<P>He loved truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and bore faithful te&s;|timony again&s;t deceit and the my&s;tery of iniquity; and often, of late time e&s;pecially, warned friends again&s;t covet|ou&s;ne&s;s, earthly-mindedne&s;s, again&s;t getting into the earth, and into a brittle &s;pirit; and the younger &s;ort, again&s;t loo&s;e|ne&s;s and pride of life.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxii" REF="037441_0071_100D8DF661F48140">
A few days before he died he had a great concern upon his mind concerning &s;ome in whom the Lord's power was working, to lead them into a mini&s;try and te&s;timony to his truth; who, through their too much entangling them&s;elves in the things of this world, did make them&s;elves unready to an&s;wer the call and leadings of the power of God, and hurt the gift that was be&s;towed upon them, and did not take that regard to their &s;ervice and mini&s;try as they ought. And mentioned the apo&s;tle's exhortation to Timothy, to <Q>take heed to his mini&s;try, and to &s;hew him&s;elf approved,</Q> &amp;c. And expre&s;&s;ed his grief concerning &s;uch as preferred their own bu&s;ine&s;s before the Lord's bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ought the ad|vancing worldly concerns before the concerns of truth: and concluded with a tender and fatherly exhortation to all to whom God had imparted of his heavenly trea&s;ure, that they would improve it faithfully; and be diligent in the Lord's work, that the earth might be &s;own with the &s;eed of the kingdom, and God's harve&s;t might be minded by tho&s;e whom he had called and enabled to labour therein: and that &s;uch would commit the care of their outward concerns to the Lord, who would care for them, and give a ble&s;&s;ing to them. However, this is not mentioned to encourage any to run un&s;ent, or without being called of God.</P>
<P>Many are living witne&s;&s;es that the Lord rai&s;ed him up by his power, to proclaim his mighty day to the nations, and made him an effectual in&s;trument in our day to turn many from darkne&s;s to light, and from Satan's power to God; and freely to &s;uffer and bear all reproaches, and the manifold per&s;ecutions, buffetings, halings, &s;tonings, impri|&s;onments, and cruelties, that were in the beginning and for &s;ome time inflicted on him and others, for the name of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>He was in his te&s;timony as a fixed &s;tar in the firmament of God's power, where all that be truly wi&s;e, and that turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall &s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the firmament, and as the &s;tars for ever and ever. He knew and preached the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t revealed, the life and &s;ub&s;tance, and the power of godline&s;s, above all &s;hadows and forms: the Lord endued him with a hidden wi&s;dom and life. He loved peace, and earne&s;tly laboured for uni|ver&s;al love, unity, peace, and good order in the churches of Chri&s;t: and where-ever he met with the contrary, it was his great grief and burden. He was greatly for the encou|ragement of faithful labourers in the Lord's work; and it
<PB N="lxxiii" REF="037441_0072_100D7F34499FCA78">was a great offence and grief to him to have their te&s;timony weakened, or labours &s;lighted, through prejudice in any profe&s;&s;ing truth.</P>
<P>And ina&s;much as the Lord &s;uffered him not to be deli|vered up to the will of his enemies and per&s;ecutors, who often heretofore breathed out cruelty again&s;t him, and de|&s;igned his de&s;truction; but in his good plea&s;ure &s;o fairly and quietly took him away in his own time, when his te&s;|timony was &s;o ble&s;&s;edly fini&s;hed, and his work accompli&s;h|ed; this is all remarkable, and worthy of &s;erious and due ob&s;ervation, as being a &s;pecial and divine providence and wi&s;dom of God; to whom we a&s;cribe the glory of all, and not unto man or creatures. Though we mu&s;t needs allow and own that good report and due e&s;teem which faithful elders, mini&s;ters, and &s;ervants of God and Chri&s;t have by faith obtained, to the prai&s;e of that ble&s;&s;ed Power that up|held them in every age in their day; many whereof are even of late taken away from the evil to come, and are at re&s;t in the Lord, out of the reach of all envy and per&s;ecu|tion, where the wicked cannot trouble them any more.</P>
<P>And we mu&s;t patiently bear our parting with them, and our lo&s;s and &s;orrow on that account, with re&s;pect to their un&s;peakable gain: yet how can we avoid being deeply af|fected with &s;adne&s;s of &s;pirit and brokenne&s;s of heart, under the &s;en&s;e and con&s;ideration of &s;uch lo&s;s and revolutions, which we have cau&s;e to believe are ominous of calamities to the wicked world, though of good to the righteous? Did the death of plain upright Jacob, namely I&s;rael, who was as a prince of God, &s;o deeply affect both his own children and kindred, as that they made a great and &s;ore lamentation for him; and even the Egyptians al&s;o, that they bewail|ed him &s;eventy days? And the death of Mo&s;es &s;o deeply affect the Children of I&s;rael, as that they "did weep and mourn for him in the plain of Moab thirty days?" And the death of Stephen, that faithful martyr of Je&s;us, &s;o deeply affect certain men fearing God, as <Q>that they made great lamentation for him?</Q> And the apo&s;tle Paul, when taking his leave of the elders of the church of Ephe&s;us and telling them, "they &s;hould &s;ee his face no more?" If this did &s;o deeply affect them, that they "wept all abun|dantly, &s;orrowing mo&s;t of all for the&s;e words, that they &s;hould &s;ee his face no more;" with many more of this kind, how then can we otherwi&s;e choo&s;e but be deeply affected with &s;orrow and &s;adne&s;s of heart, though not as tho&s;e which
<PB N="lxxiv" REF="037441_0073_100D8DFA22398920">have no hope, when &s;o many of our ancient, dear, and faithful brethren, with whom we have had much &s;weet &s;o|ciety, are removed from us one after another? (We pray God rai&s;e up and increa&s;e more &s;uch!) Yet mu&s;t we all contentedly &s;ubmit to the good plea&s;ure and wi&s;dom of the Lord our God in all the&s;e things; who taketh away, and none can hinder him, nor may any &s;ay unto him, "What do&s;t thou?" Yet we have cau&s;e to ble&s;s the Lord that he hath of late rai&s;ed, and is rai&s;ing up more to publi&s;h his name in the earth; and we that yet remain have but a &s;hort time to &s;tay after them that are gone, but we &s;hall be gone to them al&s;o. The Lord God of life keep us all faithful in his holy truth, love, unity, and life to the end. He hath a great work &s;till to bring forth in the earth, and great things to bring to pa&s;s, in order to make way for truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s to take place therein; and that his &s;eed may come forth and be gathered, and the power and kingdom of our God and of his Chri&s;t made known and exalted in the earth, unto the ends thereof.</P>
<P>Dear friends and brethren, Be faithful till death, that a crown of life you may obtain. All dwell in the love of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in union and peace in him; to whom we tenderly commit you to keep and &s;trengthen you, ble&s;s and pre&s;erve you to the end of your days.

<HEAD>THOMAS ELLWOOD'S Account of that eminent and honourable Servant of the Lord, GEORGE FOX.</HEAD>
<P>THIS holy man was rai&s;ed up by God in an extraor|dinary manner, for an extraordinary work, even to awaken the &s;leeping world, by proclaiming the mighty day of the Lord to the nations, and publi&s;hing again the ever|la&s;ting go&s;pel to the inhabitants of the earth, after the long and di&s;mal night of apo&s;tacy and darkne&s;s. For this work the Lord began to prepare him by many and various trials and exerci&s;es from his very childhood; and having fitted and furni&s;hed him for it, he called him into it very young; and made him in&s;trumental, by the effectual working of the Holy Gho&s;t, through his mini&s;try, to call many others into the &s;ame work, and to turn many thou&s;ands from darkne&s;s to the light of Chri&s;t, and from the power of Satan unto God. I knew him not till they year 1660: from that time to the time of his death, I knew him well, conver&s;ed with him often, ob&s;erved him much, loved him dearly, and ho|noured him truly; and upon good experience can &s;ay, he was indeed an heavenly-minded man, zealous for the name of the Lord, and preferred the honour of God before all things.</P>
<P>He was valiant for the truth, bold in a&s;&s;erting it, patient in &s;uffering for it, unwearied in labouring in it, &s;teady in his te&s;timony to it; immovable as a rock. Deep he was in di|vine knowledge, clear in opening heavenly my&s;teries, plain and powerful in preaching, fervent in prayer. He was richly endued with heavenly wi&s;dom, quick in di&s;cerning, &s;ound in judgment, able and ready in giving, di&s;creet in keeping coun&s;el; a lover of righteou&s;ne&s;s, an encourager of
<PB N="lxxvi" REF="037441_0075_100D8DFECF84A418">virtue, ju&s;tice, temperance, meekne&s;s, purity, cha&s;tity, mo|de&s;ty, humility, charity and &s;elf-denial in all, both by word and example. Graceful he was in countenance, manly in per&s;onage, grave in ge&s;ture, courteous in conver&s;ation, weighty in communication, in&s;tructive in di&s;cour&s;e; free from affectation in &s;peech or carriage. A &s;evere reprover of hard and ob&s;tinate &s;inners; a mild and gentle admoni&s;h|er of &s;uch as were tender, and &s;en&s;ible of their failings; not apt to re&s;ent per&s;onal wrongs; ea&s;y to forgive injuries; but zealou&s;ly earne&s;t where the honour of God, the pro&s;per|ity of truth, the peace of the church were concerned. Very tender, compa&s;&s;ionate, and pitiful he was to all that were under any &s;ort of affliction; full of brotherly love, full of fatherly care: for indeed the care of the churches of Chri&s;t was daily upon him, the pro&s;perity and peace whereof he &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;ought. Beloved he was of God, beloved of God's people; and (which was not the lea&s;t part of his honour) the common butt of all apo&s;tates envy, who&s;e good notwith&s;tanding he earne&s;tly &s;ought.</P>
<P>He lived to &s;ee the de&s;ire of his &s;oul, the &s;preading of that ble&s;&s;ed principle of divine light through many of the European nations, and not a few of the American i&s;lands and provinces, and the gathering many thou&s;ands into an e&s;tabli&s;hment therein; which the Lord vouch&s;afed him the honour to be the fir&s;t effectual publi&s;her of in this latter age of the world. And having fought a good fight, fini&s;h|ed his could, and kept the faith, his righteous &s;oul, freed from the earthly tabernacle, in which he had led an exem|plary life of holine&s;s, was tran&s;lated into tho&s;e heavenly man&s;ions, where Chri&s;t our Lord went to prepare a place for his; there to po&s;&s;e&s;s that glorious crown of righteou&s;|ne&s;s which is laid up for, and &s;hall be given by the Lord the righteous judge to all them that love his appearance. Ages to come and people yet unborn &s;hall call him ble&s;&s;ed, and ble&s;s the Lord for rai&s;ing of him up: and ble&s;&s;ed &s;hall we al&s;o be, if we &s;o walk as we had him for an exam|ple: for whom this te&s;timony lives in my heart, He lived and died the SERVANT of the LORD.</P>

<HEAD>A JOURNAL OR HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE, TRAVELS, SUFFERINGS, &amp;c. OF GEORGE FOX.</HEAD>
<P>THAT all may know the dealings of the LORD with me, and the various exerci&s;es, trials, and troubles through which be led me; in order to prepare and fit me for the work unto which he had appointed me, and may thereby be drawn to admire and glorify his Infinite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s; I think fit, before I proceed to &s;et forth my publick travels in the &s;ervice of Truth, briefly to mention how it was with me in my youth, and how the work of the LORD was begun, and gradually carried on in me, even from my childhood.</P>
<P>I was born in the month called July, in the year 1624, at Drayton in the Clay, in Leice&s;ter&s;hire. My father's name was Chri&s;topher Fox. He was by profe&s;&s;ion a weav|er, an hone&s;t man, and there was a Seed of GOD in him. The neighbours called him Righteous Chri&s;ter. My mother was an upright woman; her maiden name was Mary Lago, of the family of the Lago's, and of the &s;tock of the martyrs.</P>
<P>In my very young years I had a gravity and &s;tayedne&s;s of mind and &s;pirit not u&s;ual in children; in&s;omuch that when I have &s;een old men carry them&s;elves lightly and wan|tonly towards each other, a di&s;like thereof hath ri&s;en in my heart, and I have &s;aid within my&s;elf. <Q>If ever I come to be a man, &s;urely I &s;hould not do &s;o, nor be &s;o wanton.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="037441_0079_100D8EB560F9E8E8">
When I came to eleven years of age, I knew purene&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s; for while I was a child I was taught how to walk &s;o as to be kept pure. The LORD taught me to be faithful in all things, and to act faithfully two ways, viz. inwardly to GOD, and outwardly to man; and to keep to yea and nay in all things. For the LORD &s;hewed me, though the people of the world have mouths full of deceit and changeable words, that I was to keep to yea and nay in all things, that my words &s;hould be few and &s;avoury, &s;ea&s;oned with grace; and that I might not eat and drink to make my&s;elf wanton, but for health, u&s;ing the creatures in their &s;ervice, as &s;ervants in their places, to the glory of him that created them: they being in their covenant, and I being brought up into the covenant, as &s;anctified by the Word which was in the beginning, by which all things are upheld, wherein is unity with the creation.</P>
<P>But people being &s;trangers to the covenant of life with God, they eat and drink to make them&s;elves wanton with the creatures, wa&s;ting them upon their lu&s;ts, living in all filthine&s;s, and devouring the creation; all this in the world, in the pollutions thereof without God: therefore I was to &s;hun all &s;uch.</P>
<P>As I grew up my relations thought to have made me a prie&s;t; but others per&s;uaded to the contrary. Whereupon I was put to a man who was a &s;hoe-maker by trade, and dealt in wool. He al&s;o u&s;ed grazing, and &s;old cattle; and a great deal went through my hands. While I was with him he was ble&s;t, but after I left him he broke and came to nothing. I never wronged man or woman in all that time; for the Lord's power was with me, and over me, to pre&s;erve me. While I was in that &s;ervice, I u&s;ed in my dealings the word [Verily] and it was a common &s;aying among tho&s;e that knew me, <Q>If George &s;ays verily, there is not altering him.</Q> When boys and rude per&s;ons would laugh at me: I let them alone and went my way: but people had gene|rally a love to me for my innocency and hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>When I came towards nineteen years of age, being up|on bu&s;ine&s;s at a fair, one of my cou&s;ins, who&s;e name was Bradford, a profe&s;&s;or, having another profe&s;&s;or with him, came and a&s;ked me to drink part of a jug of beer with them, I, being thir&s;ty, went in with them; for I loved any who had a &s;en&s;e of good, or that &s;ought after the Lord. When we had drank a gla&s;s apiece, they began to drink healths, and called for more drink, agreeing together, That he that
<PB N="3" REF="037441_0080_100D7F4C48348E30">would not drink, &s;hould pay all. I was grieved that any, who made profe&s;&s;ion of religion &s;hould offer to do &s;o. They grieved me very much, having never had &s;uch a thing put to me before, by any &s;ort of people. Wherefore I ro&s;e up, and putting my hand in my pocket, took out a groat, and laid it upon the table before them, &s;aying. "If it be &s;o, I will leave you." So I went away; and when I had done my bu&s;ine&s;s returned home; but did not go to bed that night, nor could I &s;leep; but &s;ometimes walked up and down, and &s;ometimes prayed, and cried to the Lord, who &s;aid unto me; &dindx; <Q>Thou &s;ee&s;t how young people go together into vanity, and old people into the earth; thou mu&s;t for&s;ake all, young and old, keep out of all, and be as a &s;tranger unto all.</Q></P>
<P>Then at the command of God, the ninth of the &s;eventh month, 1643, I left my relations, and broke off all famili|arity or fellow&s;hip with young or old. I pa&s;&s;ed to Lutter|worth where I &s;taid &s;ome tirae. From thence I went to Northampton, where al&s;o I made &s;ome &s;tay; then pa&s;&s;ed to Newport-pagnel, in Buckingham&s;hire; where, after I had &s;taid awhile I went to Barnet, in the fourth month called June, in the year 1644. As I thus travelled through the country, profe&s;&s;ors took notice of me, and &s;ought to be ac|quainted with me; but I was afraid of them: for I was &s;en&s;ible they did not po&s;&s;e&s;s what they profe&s;&s;ed. During the time I was at Barnet, a &s;trong temptation to de&s;pair came upon me. I then &s;aw how Chri&s;t was tempted, and mighty troubles I was in. Sometimes I kept my&s;elf retired in my chamber, and often walked &s;olitary in the Chace to wait upon the Lord.</P>
<P>I wondered why the&s;e things &s;hould come to me. I look|ed upon my&s;elf, and &s;aid, "Was I ever &s;o before?" Then I thought, becau&s;e I had for&s;aken my relations, I had done ami&s;s again&s;t them. So I was brought to call to mind all my time that I had &s;pent, and to con&s;ider whether I had wronged any: but temptations grew more and more, and I was tempted almo&s;t to de&s;pair; and when Satan could not effect his de&s;ign upon me that way, he laid &s;nares and baits to draw me to commit &s;ome &s;in, whereby he might take advantage to bring me to de&s;pair. I was about twenty years of age when the&s;e exerci&s;es came upon me, and &s;ome years I continued in that condition in great trouble, and fain I would have put if from me. I went to many a prie&s;t to look for comfort, but found no comfort from them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037441_0081_100D7F4DCC896578">
From Barnet I went to London, where I took a lodging, and was under great mi&s;ery and trouble there; for I looked upon the great profe&s;&s;ors of the city of London, and &s;aw all was dark and under the chain of darkne&s;s. I had an uncle there, one Pickering, a bapti&s;t, and they were tender then: yet I could not impart my mind to him, nor join with them; for I &s;aw all, young and old, where they were. Some tender people would have had me &s;taid, but I was fearful, and returned homeward into Leice&s;ter&s;hire, having a regard upon my mind to my parents and relations, le&s;t I &s;hould grieve them; who, I under&s;tood, were troubled at my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Being returned into Leice&s;ter&s;hire, my relations would have had me married; but I told them I was but a lad, and mu&s;t get wi&s;dom. Others would have had me into the auxiliary band among the &s;oldiery, but I refu&s;ed, and was grieved that they offered &s;uch things to me, being a tender youth. Then I went to Coventry, where I took a cham|ber for awhile at a profe&s;&s;or's hou&s;e, till people began to be acquainted with me; for there were many tender people in that town. After &s;ome time I went into my own country again, and continued about a year, in great &s;orrow and trou|ble, and walked many nights by my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Then the prie&s;t of Drayton, the town of my birth, who&s;e name was Nathaniel Stevens, came often to me, and I went often to him; and another prie&s;t &s;ometimes came with him; and they would give place to me, to hear me; and I would a&s;k them que&s;tions, and rea&s;on with them. This prie&s;t Stevens a&s;ked me, <Q>Why Chri&s;t cried out upon the cro&s;s, My God, my God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</Q> And why he &s;aid, <Q>If it be po&s;&s;ible, let this cup pa&s;s from me; yet not my will, but thine be done?</Q> I told him; at that time the &s;ins of all mankind were upon him, and their in|iquities and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, with which he was wounded; which he was to bear and to be an offering for, as he was man, but died not as he was God; &s;o, in that he died for all men, ta&s;ting death for every man, he was an offering for the &s;ins of the whole world. This I &s;poke, being at that time in a mea&s;ure &s;en&s;ible of Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings. The prie&s;t &s;aid, <Q>It was a very good, full an&s;wer, and &s;uch a one as he had not heard.</Q> At that time he would applaud and &s;peak highly of me to others; and what I &s;aid in di&s;cour&s;e to him on week-days, he would preach of on fir&s;t-days,
<PB N="5" REF="037441_0082_100D7F4F64776B30">which gave me a di&s;like to him. This prie&s;t afterwards be|came my great per&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>After this I went to another ancient prie&s;t at Man&s;etter in Warwick&s;hire, and rea&s;oned with him about the ground of de&s;pair and temptations; but he was ignorant of my con|dition: he bid me take tobacco and &s;ing p&s;alms. Tobacco was a thing I did not love, and p&s;alms I was not in a &s;tate to &s;ing; I could not &s;ing. He bid me come again, and he would tell me many things; but when I came he was angry and petti&s;h, for my former words had di&s;plea&s;ed him. He told my troubles, &s;orrows, and griefs to his &s;ervants, &s;o that it was got among the milk-la&s;&s;es. It grieved me that I &s;hould open my mind to &s;uch a one. I &s;aw they were all mi&s;erable comforters, and this increa&s;ed my troubles upon me. I heard of a prie&s;t living about Tamworth, who was account|ed an experienced man. I went &s;even miles to him, but found him like an empty, hollow ca&s;k. I heard of one cal|led Dr. Cradock, of Coventry, and went to him; I a&s;ked him the ground of temptations and de&s;pair, and how trou|bles came to be wrought in man? He a&s;ked me, <Q>Who was Chri&s;t's father and mother?</Q> I told him Mary was his mother, and that he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;on of Jo|&s;eph; but he was the Son of God. As we were walking to|gether in his garden, the alley being narrow, I chanced, in turning, to &s;et my foot on the &s;ide of a bed; at which he raged as if his hou&s;e had been on fire. Thus all our di&s;cour&s;e was lo&s;t, and I went away in &s;orrow, wor&s;e than I was when I came: I thought them mi&s;erable comforters, and &s;aw they were all as nothing to me; for they could not reach my con|dition. After this I went to another, one Macham, a prie&s;t, in high account. He would needs give me &s;ome phy&s;ick, and I was to have been let blood; but they could not get one drop of blood from me, either in arms or head, though they endeavoured it, my body being, as it were, dried up with &s;orrows, grief, and troubles, which were &s;o great upon me, that I could have wi&s;hed I had never been born, or that I had been born blind, that I might never have &s;een wick|edne&s;s nor vanity; and deaf, that I might never have heard vain and wicked words, or the Lord's name bla&s;phemed. When the time called Chri&s;tmas came, while others were fea&s;ting and &s;porting them&s;elves, I looked out poor widows from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and gave them &s;ome money. When I was invited to marriages I went to none at all; but the next day, or &s;oon after, I would go and vi&s;it them; and if
<PB N="6" REF="037441_0083_100D7F6B5DB20D00">they were poor I gave them &s;ome money; for I had where|with both to keep my&s;elf from being chargeable to others, and to admini&s;ter &s;omething to the nece&s;&s;ities of others.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the year 1646, as I was going into Coventry, a con&s;ideration aro&s;e in me, how it was &s;aid, that "All chri&s;tians are believers, both prote&s;tants and pa|pi&s;ts;" and the Lord opened to me that if all were be|lievers, then they were all born of God, and pa&s;&s;ed from death to life; and that none were true believers but &s;uch: and though others &s;aid they were believers, yet they were not. At another time as I was walking in a field on a fir&s;t-day morning, the Lord opened unto me, <Q>That being bred at Oxford or Cambridge was not enough to fit and qua|lify men to be mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t:</Q> and I. wondered at it, becau&s;e it was the common belief of people. But I &s;aw it clearly as the Lord opened it to me, and was &s;atisfied and admired the goodne&s;s of the Lord, who had opened this thing unto me that morning. This &s;truck at prie&s;t Stevens's mini&s;try, namely, that <Q>to be bred at Oxford or Cam|bridge was not enough to make a man fit to be a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t.</Q> So that which opened in me, I &s;aw &s;truck at the prie&s;t's mini&s;try. But my relations were much trou|bled, that I would not go with them to hear the prie&s;t; for I would go into the orchard or the fields, with my bible, by my&s;elf. I a&s;ked them, did not the apo&s;tle &s;ay to be|lievers, <Q>That they needed no man to teach them, but as the anointing teacheth them?</Q> Though they knew this was &s;cripture, and that it was true, yet they were grieved becau&s;e I could not be &s;ubject in this matter, to go to hear the prie&s;t with them. I &s;aw that to be a true believer was another thing than they looked upon it to be; and I &s;aw that being bred at Oxford or Cambridge did not qualify or fit a man to be a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t; what then &s;hould I follow &s;uch for? So neither them, nor any of the di&s;&s;ent|ing people could I join with; but was as a &s;tranger to all, relying wholly upon the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>At another time it was opened in me, <Q>That God who made the world did not dwell in temples made with hands.</Q> This at the fir&s;t &s;eemed &s;trange, becau&s;e both prie&s;ts and people u&s;ed to call their temples or churches, dreadful places, holy ground, and the temples of God. But the Lord &s;hewed me clearly, that he did not dwell in the&s;e temples which men had commanded and &s;et up, but in peoples hearts. Both Stephen and the apo&s;tle Paul bore
<PB N="7" REF="037441_0084_100D7F6E0DAA3AE0">te&s;timony, that he did not dwell in temples made with hands, not even in that which he had once commanded to be built, &s;ince he put an end to the typical di&s;pen&s;ation; but that his people were his temple, and he dwelt in them. This opened in me, as I walked in the fields to my rela|tion's hou&s;e. When I came there, they told me Nathaniel Stevens, the prie&s;t, had been there, and &s;aid, <Q>He was afraid of me for going after new lights.</Q> I &s;miled in my|&s;elf, knowing what the Lord had opened in me concerning him and his brethren; but I told not my relations, who though they &s;aw beyond the prie&s;ts, yet went to hear them, and were grieved becau&s;e I would not go al&s;o. But I &s;hewed them by the &s;criptures, there was an anointing within man to teach him, and that the Lord would teach his people him&s;elf. I had great openings concerning the things written in the Revelations; and when I &s;poke of them, the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors would &s;ay, that was a &s;ealed book, and would have kept me out of it. But I told them, Chri&s;t could open the &s;eals, and that they were the neare&s;t things to us; for the Epi&s;tles were written to the &s;aints that lived in former ages, but the Revelations were written of things to come.</P>
<P>After this I met with a &s;ort of people that held, women have no &s;ouls (adding in a light manner) no more than a goo&s;e. I reproved them, and told them that was not right: for Mary &s;aid, <Q>My &s;oul doth magnify the Lord, and my &s;pirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</Q></P>
<P>Removing to another place I came among a people that relied much on dreams. I told them except they could di&s;tingui&s;h between dream and dream they would confound all together; for there were three &s;orts of dreams: multitude of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ometimes cau&s;ed dreams; and there were whi&s;|perings of Satan in man in the night &s;ea&s;on; and there were &s;peakings of God to man in dreams. But the&s;e people came out of the&s;e things, and at la&s;t became friends.</P>
<P>Though I had great openings, yet great trouble and temptations came many times upon me, &s;o that when it was day I wi&s;hed for night, and when it was night I wi&s;hed for day; and by rea&s;on of the openings I had in my troubles, I could &s;ay as David &s;aid, <Q>Day unto day uttereth &s;peech, and night unto night &s;heweth knowledge.</Q> When I had openings they an&s;wered one another, and an&s;wered the &s;criptures; for I had great openings of the &s;criptures; and
<PB N="8" REF="037441_0085_100D7F49F2061378">when I was in troubles, one trouble al&s;o an&s;wered to another.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the year 1647 I was moved of the Lord to go into Derby&s;hire, where I met with &s;ome friendly people, and had many di&s;cour&s;es with them. Then pa&s;&s;ing into the Peak-country, I met with more friendly people, and with &s;ome in empty high<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">notions. Travelling through &s;ome parts of Leice&s;ter&s;hire, and into Nottingham|&s;hire, I met with a tender people, and a very tender wo|man, who&s;e name was Elizabeth Hootton. With the&s;e I had &s;ome meetings and di&s;cour&s;es; but my troubles conti|nued, and I was often under great temptations. I fa&s;ted much, walked abroad in &s;olitary places many days, and often took my bible, and &s;ate in hollow trees and lone&s;ome places till night came on; and frequently in the night walked mournfully about by my&s;elf: for I was a man of &s;orrows in the time of the fir&s;t workings of the Lord in me.</P>
<P>During all this time I was never joined in profe&s;&s;ion of religion with any, but gave up my&s;elf to the Lord, having for&s;aken all evil company, taken leave of father and mo|ther, and all other relations, and travelled up and down as a &s;tranger in the earth, which way the Lord inclined my heart; taking a chamber to my&s;elf in the town where I came, and tarrying &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes le&s;s in a place: for I dur&s;t not &s;tay long in a place, being afraid both of profe&s;&s;or and profane, le&s;t, being a tender young man, I &s;hould be hurt by conver&s;ing much with either. For which rea&s;on I kept much as a &s;tranger, &s;eeking hea|venly wi&s;dom, and getting knowledge from the Lord; and was brought off from outward things, to rely on the Lord alone. Though my exerci&s;es and troubles were very great, yet were they not &s;o continual but that I had &s;ome inter|mi&s;&s;ions, and was &s;ometimes brought into &s;uch an heavenly joy, that I thought I had been in Abraham's bo&s;om. As I cannot declare the mi&s;ery I was in, it was &s;o great and heavy upon me, &s;o neither can I &s;et forth the mercies of God unto me in all my mi&s;ery. O the everla&s;ting love of God to my &s;oul, when I was in great di&s;tre&s;s! when my troubles and torments were great, then was his love exceed|ing great. Thou, Lord, make&s;t a fruitful field a barren wilderne&s;s, and a barren wilderne&s;s a fruitful field! thou bringe&s;t down and &s;ette&s;t up! thou kille&s;t and make&s;t alive! all honour and glory be to thee, O Lord of Glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y! The knowledge of thee in the Spirit is life; but that knowledge
<PB N="9" REF="037441_0086_100D7F6FA172B2C8">which is fle&s;hly works death. While there is this knowledge in the fle&s;h, deceit and &s;elf will conform to any thing, and will &s;ay Yes, Yes, to that it doth not know. The know|ledge which the world hath, of what the prophets and apo&s;tles &s;pake, is a fle&s;hly knowledge; and the apo&s;tates from the life, in which the prophets and apo&s;tles were, have got their words, the holy &s;criptures, in a form, but not in the life nor &s;pirit that gave them forth. So they all lie in con|fu&s;ion; and are making provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, to fulfil the lu&s;ts thereof, but not to fulfil the law and command of Chri&s;t in his power and Spirit: for that, they &s;ay they can|not do; but to fulfil the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, that they can do with delight.</P>
<P>After I had received that opening from the Lord, that to be bred at Oxford or Cambridge, was not &s;ufficient to fit a man to be a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, I regarded the prie&s;ts le&s;s, and looked more after the di&s;&s;enting people. Among them I &s;aw there was &s;ome tenderne&s;s; and many of them came af|terwards to be convinced, for they had &s;ome openings. But as I had for&s;aken the prie&s;ts, &s;o I left the &s;eparate preachers al&s;o, and tho&s;e called the mo&s;t experienced people; for I &s;aw there was none among them all that could &s;peak to my condition. And when all my hopes in them and in all men were gone, &s;o that I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could tell what to do; then, O then, I heard a voice which &s;aid, "There is one, even Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that can &s;peak to thy condition." When I heard it, my heart did leap for joy. Then the Lord let me &s;ee why there was none upon the earth that could &s;peak to my condition, namely, that I might give him all the glory. For all are concluded under &s;in, and &s;hut up in unbelief, as I had been, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t might have the pre-eminence, who enlightens, and gives grace, faith, and power. Thus when God doth work, who &s;hall let it? This I knew experimentally. My de&s;ires after the Lord grew &s;tronger, and zeal in the pure know|ledge of God, and of Chri&s;t alone, without the help of any man, book, or writing. For though I read the &s;criptures that &s;pake of Chri&s;t and of God, yet I knew him not but by revelation, as he who hath the key did open, and as the Father of life drew me to his Son by his Spirit. Then the Lord gently led me along, and let me &s;ee his love, which was endle&s;s and eternal, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all the knowledge that men have in the natural &s;tate, or can get by hi&s;tory or books. That love let me &s;ee my&s;elf, as I was without him;
<PB N="10" REF="037441_0087_100D8E0858005D08">and I was afraid of all company: for I &s;aw them perfect|ly, where they were, through the love of God which let me &s;ee my&s;elf. I had not fellow&s;hip with any people, prie&s;ts, nor profe&s;&s;ors, nor any &s;ort of &s;eparated people, but with Chri&s;t who hath the key, and opened the door of light and life unto me. I was afraid of all carnal talk and talkers, for I could &s;ee nothing but corruptions, and the life lay under the burden of corruptions. When I was in the deep, under all &s;hut up, I could not believe that I &s;hould ever overcome; my troubles, my &s;orrows, and my tempta|tions were &s;o great, that I often thought I &s;hould have de|&s;paired, I was &s;o tempted. But when Chri&s;t opened to me how he was tempted by the &s;ame devil, and had overcome him, and had brui&s;ed his head; and that through him and his power, light, grace, and Spirit, I &s;hould overcome al&s;o, I had confidence in him. So he it was that opened to me when I was &s;hut up, and had neither hope nor faith. Chri&s;t, who had enlightened me, gave me his light to believe in, and gave me hope, which is him&s;elf revealed in me, and gave me his &s;pirit and grace, which I found &s;ufficient in the deeps and in weakne&s;s. Thus in the deepe&s;t mi&s;eries, in the greate&s;t &s;orrows and temptations that be&s;et me, the Lord in his mercy did keep me. I found two thir&s;ts in me; the one after the creatures, to have got help and &s;trength there; and the other after the Lord the Creator, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and I &s;aw all the world could do me no good. If I had had a king's diet, palace and attendance, all would have been as nothing; for nothing gave me comfort but the Lord by his power. I &s;aw profe&s;&s;ors, prie&s;ts, and people, were whole and at ea&s;e in that condition which was my mi|&s;ery, and they loved that which I would have been rid of. But the Lord did &s;tay my de&s;ires upon him&s;elf, from whom my help came, and my care was ca&s;t upon him alone. Therefore, all wait patiently upon the Lord, what&s;oever condition you be in; wait in the grace and truth that comes by Je&s;us; for if ye &s;o do, there is a promi&s;e to you, and the Lord God will fulfil it in you. Ble&s;&s;ed are all they in|deed that do indeed hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, they &s;hall be &s;atisfied with it. I have found it &s;o, prai&s;ed be the Lord who filleth with it, and &s;atisfieth the de&s;ires of the hungry &s;oul. O let the hou&s;e of the &s;piritual I&s;rael &s;ay, His mercy endureth for ever! It is the great love of God, to make a wilderne&s;s of that which is plea&s;ant to the out|ward eye and fle&s;hly mind; and to make a fruitful field of
<PB N="11" REF="037441_0088_100D8E09ED3B48E0">a barren wilderne&s;s. This is the great work of God. But while people's minds run in the earthly, after the creatures and changeable things, changeable ways and religions, and changeable uncertain teachers, their minds are in bondage, and they are brittle and changeable, to&s;&s;ed up and down with windy doctrines, thoughts, notions, and things; their minds being out of the unchangeable truth in the inward parts, the light of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which would keep them to the unchangeable. He is the way to the Father; who in all my troubles pre&s;erved me by his Spirit and power, prai&s;ed be his holy name for ever!</P>
<P>Again, I heard a voice which &s;aid, Thou &s;erpent, thou do&s;t &s;eek to de&s;troy the life, but can&s;t not; for the &s;word which keepeth the tree of life &s;hall de&s;troy thee. So Chri&s;t, the Word of God, that brui&s;ed the head of the &s;erpent, the de&s;troyer, pre&s;erved me; my mind being joined to his good &s;eed that brui&s;ed the head of this &s;erpent, the de&s;troyer. This inward life &s;prung up in me, to an&s;wer all the oppo&s;|ing profe&s;&s;ors and prie&s;ts, and brought &s;criptures to my memory to refute them with.</P>
<P>At another time I &s;aw the great love of God, and was filled with admiration at the infinitene&s;s of it. I &s;aw what was ca&s;t out from God, and what entered into God's king|dom; and how by Je&s;us, the opener of the door by his heavenly key, the entrance was given. I &s;aw death, how it had pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, and oppre&s;&s;ed the &s;eed of God in man, and in me; and how I in the &s;eed came forth, and what the promi&s;e was to. Yet it was &s;o, that there &s;eemed to be two pleading in me; and que&s;tionings aro&s;e in my mind about gifts and prophecies, and I was tempted again to de&s;pair, as if I had &s;inned again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t. I was in great perplexity and trouble for many days; yet I gave up my&s;elf to the Lord &s;till. One day, when I had been walking &s;olitarily abroad, and was come home, I was taken up in the love of God, &s;o that I could not but ad|mire the greatne&s;s of his love; and while I was in that con|dition, it was opened unto me by the eternal light and pow|er, and I therein clearly &s;aw. That all was done and to be done in and by Chri&s;t; and how he conquers and de&s;troys this tempter the devil, and all his works, and is atop of him; and that all the&s;e troubles were good for me, and temptations for the trial of my faith, which Chri&s;t had giv|en me. The Lord opened me, that I &s;aw through all the&s;e troubles and temptations. My living faith was rai&s;ed, that
<PB N="12" REF="037441_0089_100D8E0CB2CF8D98">I &s;aw all was done by Chri&s;t the life, and my belief was in him. When at any time my condition was veiled, my &s;e|cret belief was &s;tayed firm, and hope underneath held me, as an anchor in the bottom of the &s;ea, and anchored my immor|tal &s;oul to its bi&s;hop, cau&s;ing it to &s;wim above the &s;ea, the world, where all the raging waves, foul weather, tempe&s;ts and temptations are. But O! then did I &s;ee my troubles, trials, and temptations more clearly than ever I had done. As the light appeared, all appeared that is out of the light; darkne&s;s, death, temptations, the unrighteous, the ungodly; all was manife&s;t and &s;een in the light. After this, a pure fire appeared in me: then I &s;aw how he &s;at as a refiner's fire, and as the fuller's &s;ope. Then the &s;piritual di&s;cerning came into me; by which I di&s;cerned my own thoughts, groans, and &s;ighs; and what it was that veiled me, and what it was that opened me. That which could not abide in the patience, nor endure the fire, in the light I found to be the groans of the fle&s;h, that could not give up to the will of God; which had &s;o veiled me, that I could not be patient in all trials, troubles, angui&s;hes, and perplexities; could not give up &s;elf to die by the cro&s;s, the power of God, that the living and quickened might follow him, and that that which would cloud and veil from the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, that which the &s;word of the Spirit cuts down, and which mu&s;t die, might not be kept alive. I di&s;cerned the groans of the Spirit, which opened me, and made interce&s;&s;ion to God: in which Spirit is the true waiting upon God, for the redemption of the body, and of the whole creation. By this true Spirit, in which the true &s;ighing is I &s;aw over the fal&s;e &s;ighings and groanings. By this invi&s;ible Spirit I di&s;cerned all the fal&s;e hearing, the fal&s;e &s;eeing, and the fal&s;e &s;melling, which was above the Spirit, quenching and grieving it; and that all that were there were in confu&s;ion and deceit, where the fal&s;e a&s;king and praying is, in deceit and atop, in that nature and tongue that takes God's holy name in vain, wallows in the Egyptian &s;ea, and a&s;keth but hath not; for they hate his light, re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, turn the grace into wantonne&s;s, rebel again&s;t the Spirit, and are erred from the faith they &s;hould a&s;k in, and from the Spirit they &s;hould pray by. He that knoweth the&s;e things in the true Spirit can witne&s;s them. The divine light of Chri&s;t manife&s;teth all things, the &s;piritual fire trieth and &s;evereth all things. Several things did I then &s;ee, as the Lord opened them to me; for he &s;hewed me that which can live in his holy
<PB N="13" REF="037441_0090_100D8E0EAC19FE48">refining fire, and that can live to God under his law. He made me &s;en&s;ible, how the law and the prophets were until John; and how the lea&s;t in the everla&s;ting kingdom of God is greater than John. The pure and perfect law of God is over the fle&s;h, to keep it and its works, which are not per|fect, under, by the perfect law: and the law of God which is perfect, an&s;wers the perfect principle of God i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> every one. This law the Jews, the prophets, and John were to perform and do. None knows the giver of this law but by the Spirit of God; neither can any truly read it, or hear its voice, but by the Spirit of God. He that can receive it, let him. John, who was one of the greate&s;t prophets that was born of a wo|man, bore witne&s;s to the light which Chri&s;t, the great heaven|ly prophet, hath enlightened every man that cometh into the world withal; that they might believe in it, become the children of light, and &s;o have the light of life, and not come into condemnation. For the true belief &s;tands in the light that condemns all evil; and the devil, who is the prince of darkne&s;s, and would draw out of the light into condemna|tion. They that walk in this light, come to the mountain of the hou&s;e of God, e&s;tabli&s;hed above all mountains, and to God's teaching, who will teach them his ways. The&s;e things were opened to me in the light.</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o the mountains burning up, and the rubbi&s;h, the rough, crooked ways and places made &s;mooth and plain, that the Lord might come into his tabernacle. The&s;e things are to be found in man's heart; but to &s;peak of the&s;e things being within, &s;eemed &s;trange to the rough, crooked, and mountainous ones. Yet the Lord &s;aith, <Q>O earth, hear the word of the Lord!</Q> The law of the Spirit cro&s;&s;eth the fle&s;hly mind, &s;pirit, and will, which lives in di&s;obedi|ence, and doth not keep within the law of the Spirit. I &s;aw this law was the pure love of God which was upon me, and which I mu&s;t go through, though I was troubled while I was under it; for I could not be dead to the law but through the law, which did judge and condemn that which is to be condemned. I &s;aw, many talked of the law, who had never known the law to be their &s;chool-ma&s;ter; and many ralked of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who had never known life and immortality brought to light in them by it. You that have been under that &s;chool-ma&s;ter, and the condemn|ation of it, know the&s;e things; for though the Lord in that day opened the&s;e things unto the in &s;ecret, they have been &s;ince publi&s;hed by his eternal Spirit, as on the hou&s;e-top.
<PB N="14" REF="037441_0091_100D8E10476BCBA8">As you are brought into the law, and through the law to be dead to it, and witne&s;s the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law ful|filled in you, ye will afterwards come to know what it is to be brought into the faith, and through faith from under the law; and abiding in the faith, which Chri&s;t is the author of, ye will have peace and acce&s;s to God. But if ye look out from the faith, and from that which would keep you in the victory, and look after fle&s;hly things or words, ye will be brought into bondage to the fle&s;h again, and to the law which takes hold upon the fle&s;h and &s;in, and worketh wrath, and the works of the fle&s;h will appear again. This law of God takes hold upon the law of &s;in and death; but the law of faith, the law of the Spirit of life, which is the love of God, and which comes by Je&s;us (who is the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s-&s;ake) makes free from the law of &s;in and death. The law of life fle&s;hly-minded men do not know; yet they will tempt you, to draw you from the Spi|rit into the fle&s;h, and &s;o into bondage. Therefore ye, who know the love of God, and the law of his Spirit, and the freedom that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;tand fa&s;t in him, in that divine faith which he is the author of in you; and be not entangled with the yoke of bondage. For the mini&s;try of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and his teaching, bringeth into liberty and freedom; but the mini&s;try that is of man, and by man, which &s;tands in the will of man, bringeth into bondage, and under the &s;hadow of death and darkne&s;s. Therefore none can be mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t Je&s;us but in the eternal Spirit, which was before the &s;criptures were given forth; for if they have not his Spirit, they are none of his. Though they may have his light to condemn them that hate it, yet they can never bring any into unity and fellow&s;hip in the Spirit, except they be in it; for the &s;eed of God is a burthen&s;ome &s;tone to the &s;elfi&s;h, fle&s;hly, earthly will, which reigns in its own knowledge and under&s;tanding that mu&s;t peri&s;h, and its own wi&s;dom that is devili&s;h. The Spirit of God is grieved, vexed, and quenched with that which brings into the fle&s;hly bondage; and that which wars again&s;t the Spirit of God mu&s;t be mortified by it; for the fle&s;h lu&s;teth again&s;t the Spirit, and the Spirit again&s;t the fle&s;h, and the&s;e are con|trary the one to the other. The fle&s;h would have its liber|ty, and the Spirit would have its liberty; but the Spirit is to have its liberty, and not the fle&s;h. If therefore ye quench the Spirit, join to the fle&s;h, and be &s;ervants of it, then ye are judged and tormented by the Spirit; but if ye join to
<PB N="15" REF="037441_0092_100D8E11FA0FBD30">the Spirit, and &s;erve God in it, ye have liberty and victory over the fle&s;h and its works. Therefore keep in the daily cro&s;s, the power of God, by which ye may witne&s;s all that to be crucified which is contrary to the will of God, and which &s;hall not come into his kingdom. The&s;e things are here mentioned and opened for information, exhortation, and comfort to others, as the Lord opened them unto me in that day. In that day I wondered that the children of I&s;rael &s;hould murmur for water and victuals, for I could have fa&s;ted long without murmuring or minding victuals. But I was judged at other times, that I was not contented to be &s;ometimes without the water and bread of life, that I might learn to know how to want, and how to abound.</P>
<P>I heard of a woman in Lanca&s;hire, who had fa&s;ted two-and-twenty days, and I travelled to &s;ee her; but when I came to her, I &s;aw &s;he was under a temptation. When I had &s;poken to her what I had from the Lord, I left her, her father being high in profe&s;&s;ion. Pa&s;&s;ing on, I went among the profe&s;&s;ors at Duckenfield and Manche&s;ter, where I &s;taid awhile and declared truth among them. There were &s;ome convinced, who received the Lord's teaching, by which they were confirmed, and &s;tood in the truth. The profe&s;|&s;ors were in a rage, all pleading for &s;in and imperfection; and could not endure to hear talk of perfection, or of a holy and &s;inle&s;s life. But the Lord's power was over all; though they were chained under darkne&s;s and &s;in, which they pleaded for, and quenched the tender thing in them.</P>
<P>About this time there was a great meeting of the bapti&s;ts at Broughton, in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, with &s;ome that had &s;epa|rated from them. People of other counties went thither, and I went al&s;o. Not many of the bapti&s;ts came, but abundance of other people were there; and the Lord open|ed my mouth, and his everla&s;ting truth was declared among&s;t them, and the power of the Lord was over them all. In that day the Lord's power began to &s;pring; I had great openings in the &s;criptures, and &s;everal were convinced in tho&s;e parts, and turned from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God: his power they did receive, and by it many were rai&s;ed up to prai&s;e God. When I rea&s;oned with profe&s;&s;ors and other people, &s;ome were con|vinced, and did &s;tand. Yet I was under great temptations &s;ometimes, and my inward &s;ufferings were heavy; but I could find none to open my condition to but the Lord alone, unto whom I cried night and day. I went back
<PB N="16" REF="037441_0093_100D8E14EC4E4518">into Nottingham&s;hire, where the Lord &s;hewed me, that the natures of tho&s;e things which were hurtful without, were within in the hearts and minds of wicked men. The na|tures of dogs, &s;wine, vipers, of Sodom and Egypt, Pharaoh, Cain I&s;hmael, E&s;au, &amp;c. The natures of the&s;e I &s;aw with|in though people had been looking without. I cried to the Lord, &s;aying, <Q>Why &s;hould I be thus, &s;eeing I was never addicted to commit tho&s;e evils?</Q> And the Lord an&s;wered, <Q>It was needful I &s;hould have a &s;en&s;e of all con|ditions, how el&s;e &s;hould I &s;peak to all conditions?</Q> In this I &s;aw the infinite love of God. I &s;aw al&s;o, that there was an ocean of darkne&s;s and death; but an infinite ocean of light and love, which flowed over the ocean of darkne&s;s. In that al&s;o I &s;aw the infinite love of God, and I had great openings. As I was walking by the &s;teeple-hou&s;e &s;ide in the town of Mansfield, the Lord &s;aid unto me, <Q>That which people trample upon mu&s;t be thy food.</Q> And as the Lord &s;pake he opened to me, that people and profe&s;&s;ors trampled upon the life, even the life of Chri&s;t was trampled upon; they fed upon words, and fed one another with words; but trampled under foot the blood of the &s;on of God, which blood was my life: and they lived in their airy notions talking of him. It &s;eemed &s;trange to me at the fir&s;t, that I &s;hould feed on that which the high profe&s;&s;ors tram|pled upon; but the Lord opened it clearly to me by his eternal Spirit and power.</P>
<P>Then came people from far and near to &s;ee me; but I was fearful of being drawn out by them: yet I was made to open things to them. One Brown had great prophecies and &s;ights upon his death-bed of me. He &s;poke openly, of what I &s;hould be made in&s;trumental by the Lord to bring forth. And of others he &s;poke, that they &s;hould come to nothing; which was fulfilled on &s;ome, who then were &s;omething in &s;hew. When this man was buried, a great work of the Lord fell upon me, to the admiration of many, who thought I had been dead; and many came to &s;ee me for about fourteen days. I was very much altered in countenance and per&s;on, as if my body had been new-moulded o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> changed. While I was in that condition, I had a &s;en&s;e and di&s;cerning given me by the Lord, through which I &s;aw plainly, that when many people talked of God and of Chri&s;t, &amp;c. the &s;erpent &s;poke in them; but this was hard to be borne. Yet the work of the Lord went on in &s;ome, and my &s;orrows and troubles began to wear off,
<PB N="17" REF="037441_0094_100D8E1778552868">and tears of joy dropped from me, &s;o that I could have wept night and day with tears of joy to the Lord, in humi|lity and brokenne&s;s of heart. I &s;aw into that which was without end, things which cannot be uttered, and of the greatne&s;s and infinitene&s;s of the love of God, which cannot be expre&s;&s;ed by words. For I had been brought through the very ocean of darkne&s;s and death, and through and over the power of Satan, by the eternal glorious power of Chri&s;t; even through that darkne&s;s was I brought which covered over all the world, which chained down all, and &s;hut up all in the death. The &s;ame eternal power of God which brought me through the&s;e things, was that which af|terwards &s;hook the nations, prie&s;ts, profe&s;&s;ors, and people. Then could I &s;ay, I had been in &s;piritual Babylon, Sodom, Egypt, and the grave; but by the eternal power of God I was come out of it, was brought over it, and the power of it into the power of Chri&s;t. And I &s;aw the harve&s;t white, and the &s;eed of God lying thick in the ground, as ever did wheat that was &s;own outwardly, and none to gather it; for this I mourned with tears. A report went abroad of me, that I was a young man who had a di&s;cerning &s;pirit; where|upon many came to me from far and near, profe&s;&s;ors, prie&s;ts, and people. The Lord's power broke forth, and I had great openings and prophecies, and &s;poke unto them of the things of God, which they heard with attention and &s;i|lence, and went away and &s;pread the &s;ame thereof. Then came the tempter and &s;et upon me again, charging me, that I had &s;inned again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t; but I could not tell in what. Then Paul's condition came before me, how after he had been taken up into the third heavens, and &s;een things not lawful to be uttered, a me&s;&s;enger of Satan was &s;ent to buffet him. Thus by the power of Chri&s;t I got over that temptation al&s;o.</P>
<P>In the year 1648, as I was &s;itting in a friend's hou&s;e in Nottingham&s;hire (for by this time the power of God had opened the hearts of &s;ome to receive the word of life and reconciliation) I &s;aw there was a great crack to go through|out the earth, and a great &s;moke to go as the crack went, and that after the crack there &s;hould be a great &s;haking. This was the earth in people's hearts, which was to be &s;ha|ken before the &s;eed of God was rai&s;ed out of the earth. And it was &s;o: for the Lord's power began to &s;hake them, and great meetings we began to have, and a mighty power
<PB N="18" REF="037441_0095_100D8E190F05DEF8">and work of God there was among&s;t people, to the a&s;to|ni&s;hment of both people and prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>There was a meeting of prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors at a ju&s;tice's hou&s;e, and I went among them. Here they di&s;cour&s;ed how Paul &s;aid, <Q>He had not known &s;in but by the law, which &s;aid, Thou &s;halt not lu&s;t:</Q> and they held that to be &s;po|ken of the outward law. But I told them, Paul &s;poke that after he was convinced; for he had the outward law before, and was bred up in it, when he was in the lu&s;t of per&s;ecu|tion; but this was the law of God in his mind which he &s;erved, which the law in his members warred again&s;t: for that which he thought had been life to him, proved death. So the more &s;ober of the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors con&s;ented that it was not the outward law, but the inward, which &s;hewed the inward lu&s;t which Paul &s;pake of after he was convinced; for the outward law took hold of the outward action, but the inward law of the inward lu&s;t.</P>
<P>After this I went again to Mansfield, where was a great meeting of profe&s;&s;ors and people, where I was moved to pray; and the Lord's power was &s;o great, that the hou&s;e &s;eemed to be &s;haken. When I had done, &s;ome of the profe&s;&s;ors &s;aid, <Q>It was now as in the days of the apo&s;tles, when the hou&s;e was &s;haken where they were.</Q> After I had prayed, one of the profe&s;&s;ors would pray which brought deadne&s;s and a veil over them. Others of the profe&s;&s;ors were grieved at him, and told him, "It was a temptation upon him." Then he came to me, and de&s;ired that I would pray again; but I could not pray in man's will.</P>
<P>Soon after there was another great meeting of profe&s;&s;ors, and a captain named Amor Stoddard came in. They were di&s;cour&s;ing of the blood of Chri&s;t. As they were di&s;cour&s;|ing of it, I &s;aw, through the immediate opening of the invi&s;ible Spirit, the blood of Chri&s;t; and cried out among them, &s;aying, <Q>Do ye not &s;ee the blood of Chri&s;t? See it in your hearts, to &s;prinkle your hearts and con&s;ciences from dead works, to &s;erve the living God.</Q> For I &s;aw the blood of the new covenant, how it came into the heart. This &s;tartled the profe&s;&s;ors, who would have the blood only without them, and not in them. But captain Stoddard was reached, and &s;aid, <Q>Let the youth &s;peak, hear the youth &s;peak;</Q> when he &s;aw they endeavoured to bear me down with many words.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o a company of prie&s;ts, that were looked upon to be tender; one of their names was Kellet, and &s;e|veral
<PB N="19" REF="037441_0096_100D8E1B2BB8A468">tender people went to hear them. I was moved to go after them, and bid them mind the Lord's teaching in their inward parts. Prie&s;t Kellet was again&s;t par&s;onage then: but afterwards he got a great one, and turned per&s;e|cutor.</P>
<P>After I had &s;ome &s;ervice in the&s;e parts, I went through Derby&s;hire into my own country Leice&s;ter&s;hire again, and &s;everal tender people were convinced. Pa&s;&s;ing thence, I met with a great company of profe&s;&s;ors in Warwick&s;hire, who were praying and expounding the &s;criptures in the fields. They gave the bible to me, and I opened it on the fifth of Matthew, where Chri&s;t expounded the law; and I opened the inward &s;tate to them, and outward &s;tate; upon which they fell into a fierce contention, and parted: but the Lord's power got ground.</P>
<P>Then I heard of a great meeting to be at Leice&s;ter for a di&s;pute, wherein pre&s;byterians, independents, bapti&s;ts, and common-prayer-men, were &s;aid to be all concerned. The meeting was in a &s;teeple-hou&s;e; to which I was moved by the Lord God to go, and be among&s;t them. I heard their di&s;cour&s;e and rea&s;onings, &s;ome being in pews, and the prie&s;t in the pulpit, abundance of people being gathered together. At la&s;t one woman a&s;ked a que&s;tion out of Peter, What that birth was, viz. A being born again of incorruptible &s;eed, by the Word of God, that liveth and abideth for ever? The prie&s;t &s;aid to her, I permit not a woman to &s;peak in the church; though he had before given liberty for any to &s;peak. Whereupon I was wrapped up as in a rapture, in the Lord's power; and I &s;tepped up, and a&s;ked the prie&s;t, Do&s;t thou call this place (the &s;teeple-hou&s;e) a church? or do&s;t thou call this mixed multitude a church? For the wo|man a&s;king a que&s;tion, he ought to have an&s;wered it, having given liberty for any to &s;peak. But, in&s;tead of an&s;wering me, he a&s;ked me, What a church was? I told him, The church was the pillar and ground of truth, made up of liv|ing &s;tones, living members, a &s;piritual hou&s;hold, which Chri&s;t was the head of: but he was not the head of a mix|ed multitude, or of an old hou&s;e made up of lime, &s;tones, and wood. This &s;et them all on a fire. The prie&s;t came down from his pulpit, and others out of their pews, and the di&s;pute there was marred. I went to a great inn, and there di&s;puted the thing with the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors, who were all on fire. But I maintained the true church, and the true head thereof, over their heads, till they all gave out and
<PB N="20" REF="037441_0097_100D8E1D5D9086F8">fled away. One man &s;eemed loving, and appeared for a while to join with me; but he &s;oon turned again&s;t me, and joined with a prie&s;t, in pleading for infant bapti&s;m, though him&s;elf had been a bapti&s;t before; &s;o he left me alone. Howbeit, there were &s;everal convinced that day; the woman that a&s;ked the que&s;tion was convinced, and her family: and the Lord's power and glory &s;hined over all.</P>
<P>After this I returned into Nottingham&s;hire again, and went into the Vale of Beavor. As I went, I preached re|pentance to the people. There were many convinced in the Vale of Beavor, in many towns; for I &s;taid &s;ome weeks among&s;t them. One morning, as I was &s;itting by the fire, a great cloud came over me, a temptation be&s;et me; and I &s;at &s;till. It was &s;aid, "All things come by nature:" and the elements and &s;tars came over me, &s;o that I was in a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er quite clouded with it. But as I &s;at &s;till and &s;aid nothing, the people of the hou&s;e perceived nothing. And as I &s;at &s;till under it and let it alone, a living hope and a true voice aro&s;e in me, which &s;aid, <Q>There is a living God who made all things.</Q> Immediately the cloud and tempt|ation vani&s;hed away, and life ro&s;e over it all; my heart was glad, and I prai&s;ed the living God. After &s;ome time I met with &s;ome people who had a notion that there was no God, but that all things come by nature. I had a great di&s;pute with them, and overturned them, and made &s;ome of them confe&s;s, that there is a living God. Then I &s;aw that it was good that I had gone through that exerci&s;e. We had great meetings in tho&s;e parts; for the power of the Lord broke through in that &s;ide of the country. Returning into Nottingham&s;hire, I found there a company of &s;hattered bapti&s;ts, and others. The Lord's power wrought mightily, and gathered many of them. Afterwards I went to Mans|field and there-away; where the Lord's power was wonder|fully manife&s;ted both at Mansfield, and other towns there|abouts. In Derby&s;hire the mighty power of God wrought in a wonderful manner. At Eton, a town near Derby, there was a meeting of friends, where appeared &s;uch a mighty power of God that they were greatly &s;haken, and many mouths were opened in the power of the Lord God. Many were moved by the Lord to go to &s;teeple-hou&s;es to the prie&s;ts and people, to declare the everla&s;ting truth unto them.</P>
<P>At a certain time when I was at Mansfield there was a &s;itting of the ju&s;tices about hiring &s;ervants; and it was up|on
<PB N="21" REF="037441_0098_100D8E200456CF30">me from the Lord to go and &s;peak to the ju&s;tices, that they &s;hould not oppre&s;s the &s;ervants in their wages. So I walked towards the inn where they &s;at; but finding a com|pany of fiddlers there, I did not go in, but thought to come in the morning, when I might have a more &s;erious opportunity to di&s;cour&s;e with them, not thinking that a &s;ea|&s;onable time. But when I came again in the morning, they were gone, and I was &s;truck even blind, that I could not &s;ee. I inquired of the inn-keeper, where the ju&s;tices were to &s;it that day? He told me, At a town eight miles off. My &s;ight began to come to me again; and I went and ran thitherward as fa&s;t as I could. When I was come to the hou&s;e where they were, and many &s;ervants with them, I exhorted the ju&s;tices not to oppre&s;s the &s;ervants in their wa|ges, but to do that which was right and ju&s;t to them; and I exhorted the &s;ervants to do their duties, and &s;erve hone&s;t|ly, &amp;c. They all received my exhortation kindly, for I was moved of the Lord therein.</P>
<P>Moreover, I was moved to go to &s;everal courts and &s;tee|ple-hou&s;es at Mansfield and other places, to warn them to leave off oppre&s;&s;ion and oaths, and to turn from deceit to the Lord, and do ju&s;tly. Particularly at Mansfield, after I had been at a court there, I was moved to go and &s;peak to one of the wickede&s;t men in the country, one who was a common drunkard, a noted whorema&s;ter, and a rhime-ma|ker; and I reproved him, in the dread of the mighty God, for his evil cour&s;es. When I had done &s;peaking, and left him, he came after me, and told me, He was &s;o &s;mitten when I &s;pake to him, that he had &s;carce any &s;trength left in him. So this man was convinced, turned from his wic|kedne&s;s, and remained an hone&s;t, &s;ober man, to the a&s;to|ni&s;hment of the people who had known him before. Thus the work of the Lord went forward, and many were turned from darkne&s;s to light, within the compa&s;s of the&s;e three years, 1646, 1647, and 1648. Divers meetings of friends, in &s;everal places, were then gathered to God's teaching, by his light, Spirit, and power: for the Lord's power broke forth daily more and more wonderfully.</P>
<P>Now was I come up in Spirit, through the flaming &s;word, into the paradi&s;e of God. All things were new; and all the creation gave another &s;mell unto me than before, beyond what words can utter. I knew nothing but purene&s;s, inno|cency, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, being renewed up into the image of God by Chri&s;t Je&s;us; &s;o that I was come up to the &s;tate
<PB N="22" REF="037441_0099_100D8E21966A72F8">of Adam, which he was in before he fell. The creation was opened to me; and it was &s;hewed me, how all things had their names given them, according to their nature and virtue. I was at a &s;tand in my mind, whether I &s;hould practice phy&s;ick for the good of mankind, &s;eeing the nature and virtues of the creatures were &s;o opened to me by the Lord. But I was immediately taken up in Spirit, to &s;ee into another or more &s;teadfa&s;t &s;tate than Adam's in innocen|cy, even into a &s;tate in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that &s;hould never fall. The Lord &s;hewed me, that &s;uch as were faithful to him, in the power and light of Chri&s;t, &s;hould come up into that &s;tate in which Adam was before he fell; in which the ad|mirable works of the creation, and the virtues thereof may be known, through the openings of that divine Word of wi&s;dom and power by which they were made. Great things did the Lord lead me into, and wonderful depths were opened unto me, beyond what can by words be declared; but as people come into &s;ubjection to the Spirit of God, and grow up in the image and power of the Almighty, they may receive the word of wi&s;dom that opens all things, and come to know the hidden unity in the Eternal Being.</P>
<P>Thus travelled I in the Lord's &s;ervice, as he led me. When I came to Nottingham, the mighty power of God was there among friends. From thence I went to Clau&s;on in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, in the Vale of Beavor, and the mighty power of God appeared there al&s;o, in &s;everal towns and villages where friends were gathered. While I was there, the Lord opened to me three things, relating to tho&s;e three great profe&s;&s;ions in the world, law, phy&s;ick, and divinity (&s;o called.) He &s;hewed me, that the phy&s;icians were out of the wi&s;dom of God, by which the creatures were made; and knew not the virtues of the creatures, becau&s;e they were out of the Word of wi&s;dom, by which they were made. He &s;hewed me, the prie&s;ts were out of the true faith, which Chri&s;t is the author of; the faith which purifies, gives vic|tory, and brings people to have acce&s;s to God. by which they plea&s;e God; the my&s;tery of which faith is held in a pure con&s;cience. He &s;hewed me al&s;o, that the lawyers were out of the equity, out of the true ju&s;tice, and out of the law of God, which went over the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and over all &s;in, and an&s;wered the Spirit of God, that was grieved and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed in man. And that the&s;e three, the phy&s;icians, the prie&s;ts, and the lawyers, ruled the world out of the wi&s;|dom, out of the faith, and out of the equity and law of
<PB N="23" REF="037441_0100_100D8E2373121CA8">God; the one pretending the cure of the body, the other the cure of the &s;oul, and the third the protection of the pro|perty of the people. But I &s;aw they were all out of the wi&s;dom, out of the faith, out of the equity and perfect law of God. And as the Lord opened the&s;e things unto me, I felt his power went forth over all, by which all might be reformed, if they would receive and bow unto it. The prie&s;ts might be reformed, and brought into the true faith, which is the gift of God. The lawyers might be reformed, and brought into the law of God, which an&s;wers that of God, which is tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, in every one, and brings to love one's neighbour as him&s;elf. This lets man &s;ee, if he wrongs his neighbour, he wrongs him&s;elf; and this teaches him to do unto others as he would they &s;hould do unto him. The phy&s;icians might be reformed, and brought into the wi&s;dom of God, by which all things were made and created; that they might receive a right knowledge of the creatures, and under&s;tand the virtues of them, which the Word of Wi&s;|dom, by which they were made and are upheld, hath given them. Abundance was opened concerning the&s;e things; how all lay out of the wi&s;dom of God, and out of the righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s that man at the fir&s;t was made in. But as all believe in the light, and walk in the light which Chri&s;t hath enlightened every man that cometh into the world withal, and become children of the light, and of the day of Chri&s;t; in his day all things are &s;een, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, by the divine light of Chri&s;t, the &s;piritual heavenly man, by whom all things were made and created.</P>
<P>I &s;aw concerning the prie&s;ts, that although they &s;tood in the deceit, and acted by the dark power which both they and their people were kept under; yet they were not the greate&s;t deceivers &s;poken of in the &s;criptures, for they were not come &s;o far as many of the&s;e had come. But the Lord opened to me who the greate&s;t deceivers were, and how far they might come; even &s;uch as came as far as Cain, to hear the voice of God; &s;uch as came out of Egypt, and through the Red Sea, to prai&s;e God on the banks of the &s;ea-&s;hore; &s;uch as could &s;peak by experience of God's miracles and wonders; &s;uch as were come as far as Corah, Dathan, and their company; &s;uch as were come as far as Balaam, who could &s;peak the word of the Lord, who heard his voice and knew it, and knew his Spirit, and could &s;ee the &s;tar of Jacob, and the goodline&s;s of I&s;rael's Tent; the &s;econd birth, which no enchantment could prevail again&s;t; the&s;e that
<PB N="24" REF="037441_0101_100D8E26D36721F0">could &s;peak &s;o much of their experiences of God, and yet turned from the Spirit and the Word, and went into the gain&s;aying, the&s;e were and would be the great deceivers, far beyond the prie&s;ts. Likewi&s;e among chri&s;tians, &s;uch as &s;hould preach in Chri&s;t's name, &s;hould work miracles, ca&s;t out devils, and go as far as a Cain, a Corah, and a Balaam in the go&s;pel-times, the&s;e were and would be the great de|ceivers. They that could &s;peak &s;ome experiences of Chri&s;t and God, but lived not in the life, the&s;e were they that led the world after them, who got the form of godline&s;s, but de|nied the power; who inwardly ravened from the Spirit, and brought people into the form, but per&s;ecuted them that were in the power, as Cain did; and ran greedily after the error of Balaam, through covetou&s;ne&s;s, loving the wages of un|righteou&s;ne&s;s, as Balaam did. The&s;e followers of Cain, Corah, and Balaam, have brought the world, &s;ince the apo&s;tles days to be like a &s;ea. Such as the&s;e I &s;aw might deceive now, as they did in former ages; but it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for them to deceive the elect, who were cho&s;en in Chri&s;t, who was before the world began, and before the deceiver was: though others may be deceived in their openings and prophecies, not keeping their minds to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who doth open and reveal to his.</P>
<P>I &s;aw the &s;tate of tho&s;e, both prie&s;ts and people, who in reading the &s;criptures cry out much again&s;t Cain, E&s;au, Judas, and other wicked men of former times, mentioned in the holy &s;criptures; but do not &s;ee the nature of Cain, of E&s;au, of Judas, and tho&s;e others, in them&s;elves. The&s;e &s;aid, it was they, they, they, that were the bad people; put|ting it off from them&s;elves: but when &s;ome of the&s;e came, with the light and Spirit of truth, to &s;ee into them&s;elves, them they came to &s;ay, I, I, I, it is I my&s;elf, that have been the I&s;hmael, the E&s;au, &amp;c. For then they &s;aw the nature of wild I&s;hmael in them&s;elves; the nature of Cain, E&s;au, Corah, Balaam, and of the &s;on of perdition in them&s;elves, &s;itting above all that is called God in them. I &s;aw, it was the fallen man that was got up into the &s;criptures, and was finding fault with tho&s;e before-mentioned; and with the back&s;liding Jews, calling them the &s;turdy oaks, tall cedars, fat bulls of Ba&s;han, wild heifers, vipers, &s;erpents, &amp;c. and charging them, that it was they that clo&s;ed their eyes, &s;top|ped their ears, hardened their hearts, and were dull of hear|ing; it was they that hated the light, rebelled again&s;t it, quenched the Spirit, vexed and grieved it, walked de&s;pite|fully
<PB N="25" REF="037441_0102_100D8E28DC07A0F0">again&s;t the Spirit of grace, and turned the grace of God into wantonne&s;s; it was they that re&s;i&s;ted the Holy Gho&s;t, got the form of godline&s;s, and turned again&s;t the power; and they were the inwardly ravening wolves who had got the &s;heep's cloathing; they were the wells without water, clouds without rain, trees without fruit, &amp;c. But when the&s;e, who were &s;o much taken up with finding fault with others, and thought them&s;elves clear from the&s;e things, came to look into them&s;elves, and with the light of Chri&s;t throughly to &s;earch them&s;elves, they might &s;ee enough of this in them&s;elves; then the cry could not be, It is he or they, but I and we are found in the&s;e conditions.</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o, how people read the &s;criptures without a right &s;en&s;e of them, and without duly applying them to their own &s;tates. For when they read, that death reigned from Adam to Mo&s;es; that the law and the prophets were un|til John; and that the lea&s;t in the kingdom is greater than John; they read the&s;e things without them, and ap|plied them to others (and the things were true of others) but they did not turn in to find the truth of the&s;e things in them&s;elves. As the&s;e things were opened in me, I &s;aw death reigned over them from Adam to Mo&s;es; from the entrance into tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, till they came to the mini&s;tration of condemnation, which re&s;trains people from &s;in that brings death. When the mini&s;tration of Mo&s;es is pa&s;&s;ed through, the mini&s;try of the prophets comes to be read and under|&s;tood, which reaches through the figures, types, and &s;ha|dows unto John, the greate&s;t prophet born of a woman; who&s;e mini&s;tration prepares the way of the Lord, by bring|ing down the exalted mountains, and making &s;traight paths. As this mini&s;tration is pa&s;&s;ed through, an entrance comes to be known into the everla&s;ting kingdom. I &s;aw plainly, that none could read Mo&s;es aright without Mo&s;es's Spirit, by which he &s;aw how man was in the image of God in pa|radi&s;e, how he fell, how death came over him, and how all men have been under this death. I &s;aw how Mo&s;es receiv|ed the pure law, that went over all tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; and how the clean bea&s;ts, which were figures and types, were offered up, when the people were come into the righteous law that went over the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Mo&s;es and the prophets &s;aw through the types and figures, and beyond them, and &s;aw Chri&s;t the great prophet, that was to come to fulfil them. I &s;aw that none could read John's words aright, and with a true under&s;tanding of them, but in and with
<PB N="26" REF="037441_0103_100D8E2A718B0778">the &s;ame divine Spirit by which John &s;pake them; and by his burning, &s;hining light which is &s;ent from God. For by that Spirit their crooked nature might be made &s;traight, their rough natures &s;mooth, and the exacter and violent doer in them might be ca&s;t out; and tho&s;e that had been hypocrites, might come to bring forth fruits meet for re|pentance, and their mountain of &s;in and earthline&s;s might be laid low, and their valley exalted in them, that there might be a way prepared for the Lord in them: then the lea&s;t in the kingdom is greater than John. But all mu&s;t fir&s;t know the voice crying in the wilderne&s;s in their hearts, which through tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion were become as a wilderne&s;s. Thus I &s;aw it was an ea&s;y matter to &s;ay, death reigned from Adam to Mo&s;es; and that the law and the prophets were until John; and that the lea&s;t in the king|dom is greater than John; but none could know how death reigned from Adam to Mo&s;es, &amp;c. but by the &s;ame holy Spirit which Mo&s;es, the prophets, and John were in. They could not know the &s;piritual meaning of Mo&s;es, the pro|phets, and John's words, nor &s;ee their path and travels, much le&s;s to &s;ee through them, and to the end of them into the kingdom, unle&s;s they had the Spirit and light of Je&s;us; nor could they know the words of Chri&s;t and of his apo&s;tles without his Spirit. But as man comes thro' by the Spirit and power of God to Chri&s;t (who fulfils the types, figures, &s;hadows, promi&s;es, and prophecies concerning him) and is led by the Holy Gho&s;t into the truth and &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;criptures, &s;itting down in him who is the author and end of them, then are they read and under&s;tood with profit and great delight.</P>
<P>Moreover the Lord God let me &s;ee, when I was brought up into his image in righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s, and into the paradi&s;e of God, the &s;tate, how Adam was made a living &s;oul; and al&s;o the &s;tature of Chri&s;t, the my&s;tery that had been hid from ages and generations: which things are hard to be uttered, and cannot be borne by many. For of all the &s;ects in Chri&s;tendom (&s;o called) that I di&s;cour&s;ed withal, I found none who could hear to be told, that any &s;hould come to Adam's perfection, into that image of God, that righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s that Adam was in before he fell; to be clear and pure without &s;in as he was. Therefore, how &s;hould they be able to bear being told, that any &s;hould grow up to the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t, when they cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear to hear that any &s;hall come, whil&s;t

<P>The Lord God opened to me by his invi&s;ible power, how "every man was enlightened by the divine light of Chri&s;t." I &s;aw it &s;hine through all, and that they that believed in it came out of condemnation to the light of life, and became the children of it; but they that hated it, and did not believe in it, were condemned by it, though they made a profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t. This I &s;aw in the pure openings of the light without the help of any man; neither did I then know where to find it in the &s;criptures; though afterwards, &s;earching the &s;criptures, I found it. For I &s;aw in that Light and Spirit which was before the Scriptures were given forth, and which led the holy men of God to give them forth, that all mu&s;t come to that Spirit, if they would know God or Chri&s;t, or the &s;criptures aright, which they that gave them forth were led and taught by.</P>
<P>But I ob&s;erved a dulne&s;s and drowzy heavine&s;s upon people, which I wondered at; for &s;ometimes, when I would &s;et my&s;elf to &s;leep, my mind went over all to the beginning, in that which is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting I &s;aw death was to pa&s;s over this &s;leepy, heavy &s;tate, and I told people they mu&s;t come to witne&s;s death to that &s;leepy, heavy nature, and a cro&s;s to it in the power of God, that their minds and hearts might be on things above.</P>
<P>On a certain time, as I was walking in the fields, the Lord &s;aid unto me, <Q>Thy name is written in the Lamb's book of life, which was before the foundation of the world:</Q> and as the Lord &s;poke it, I believed and &s;aw it in the new birth. Some time after, the Lord commanded me to go abroad into the world, which was like a briery, thorny wilderne&s;s. When I came in the Lord's mighty power with the word of life into the world, the world &s;wel|led and made a noi&s;e like the great raging waves of the &s;ea. Prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors, magi&s;trates and people, were all like a &s;ea, when I came to proclaim the day of the Lord among&s;t them, and to preach repentance to them.</P>
<P>I was &s;ent to turn people from darkne&s;s to the light, that they might receive Chri&s;t Je&s;us; for to as many as &s;hould receive him in his light, I &s;aw he would give power to become the &s;ons of God; which I had obtained by re|ceiving Chri&s;t. I was to direct people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Spirit, that
<PB N="28" REF="037441_0105_100D8E2EAC473480">gave forth the &s;criptures, by which they might be led into all truth, and up to Chri&s;t and God, as tho&s;e had been who gave them forth. I was to turn them to the grace of God, and to the truth in the heart, which came by Je&s;us; that by this grace they might be taught, which would bring them &s;alvation, that their hearts might be e&s;tabli&s;hed by it, their words might be &s;ea&s;cned, and all might come to know their &s;alvation nigh. I &s;aw Chri&s;t died for all men, was a propitiation for all, and enlightened all men and women with his divine and &s;aving light; and that none could be true believers, but tho&s;e who believed therein. I &s;aw that the grace of God, which brings &s;alvation, had appeared to all men, and that the manife&s;tation of the Spirit of God was given to every man, to profit withal. The&s;e things I did not &s;ee by the help of man, nor by the letter, though they are written in the letter; but I &s;aw them in the light of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by his immediate Spirit and power, as did the holy men of God by whom the holy &s;criptures were written. Yet I had no &s;light e&s;teem of the holy &s;criptures, they were very precious to me; for I was in that Spirit by which they were given forth; and what the Lord opened in me, I afterwards found was agreeable to them. I could &s;peak much of the&s;e things, and many volumes might be written; but all would prove too &s;hort to &s;et forth the infinite love, wi&s;dom, and power of God, in preparing, fitting, and furni&s;hing me for the &s;ervice he had appointed me to; letting me &s;ee the depth of Satan on the one hand, and opening to me, on the other hand, the divine my&s;teries of his own everla&s;ting kingdom.</P>
<P>When the Lord God and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ent me forth into the world to preach his everla&s;ting go&s;pel and kingdom, I was glad that I was commanded to turn peo|ple to that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nward light, &s;pirit, and grace, by which all might know their &s;alvation and their way to God; even that Divine Spirit which would lead them into all truth, and which I infallibly knew would never deceive any.</P>
<P>But with and by this divine power and &s;pirit of God. and the light of Je&s;us, I was to bring people off from all their own ways, to Chri&s;t the new and living way; from their churches, which men had made and gathered, to the church in God, the general a&s;&s;embly written in heaven, which Chri&s;t is the head of; and off from the world's teach|ers made by men, to learn of Chri&s;t, who is the way, the truth, and the li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of whom the Father &s;aid, <Q>This is

I was to bring people off from all the world's religions, which are in vain; that they might know the pure religion might vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s, the widows and the &s;trangers, and keep them&s;elves from the &s;pots of the world: then there would not be &s;o many beggars; the &s;ight of whom often grieved my heart, as it denoted &s;o much hard-heartedne&s;s among&s;t tho&s;e that profe&s;&s;ed the name of Chri&s;t. I was to bring them off from all the world's fellow&s;hips, prayings, and &s;ingings, which &s;tood in forms without pow|er; that their fellow&s;hip might be in the Holy Gho&s;t, the eternal Spirit of God; that they might pray in the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;ing in the Spirit, and with the grace that comes by Je&s;us; making melody in their hearts to the Lord, who hath &s;ent his beloved Son to be their Saviour, cau&s;ed his heavenly &s;un to &s;hine upon all the world, and through them all; and his heavenly rain to fall upon the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t (as his outward rain doth fall, and his out|ward &s;un doth &s;hine on all) which is God's un&s;peakable love to the world. I was to bring people off from Jewi&s;h ceremonies, from heatheni&s;h fables, from men's inventions and windy doctrines, by which they blowed the people about, this way and the other way, from &s;ect to &s;ect; and from all their beggarly rudiments, with their &s;chools and colleges, for making mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, who are indeed mini&s;ters of their own making, but not of Chri&s;t's; and from all their images, cro&s;&s;es, and &s;prinkling of infants, with their holy-days (&s;o called) and all their vain traditions, which they had got up &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, which the Lord's power was again&s;t. In the dread and authority thereof was I moved to declare again&s;t them all, and again&s;t all that preached and not freely, as &s;uch who had not re|ceived freely from Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Moreover, when the Lord &s;ent me into the world, he forbad me "to put off my hat" to any, high or low; and I was required to thee and thou all men and women, with|out any re&s;pect to rich or poor, great or &s;mall. And as I travelled up and down, I was not to bid people Good morrow, or Good evening, neither might I bow or &s;crape with my leg to any one; this made the &s;ects and profe&s;&s;ions
<PB N="30" REF="037441_0107_100D8E32CBBF7240">rage. But the Lord's power carried me over all to his glory, and many came to be turned to God in a little time; for the heavenly day of the Lord &s;prung from on high, and broke forth apace; by the light of which many came to &s;ee where they were.</P>
<P>Oh! the rage that was in the prie&s;ts, magi&s;trates, profe&s;|&s;ors, and people of all &s;orts; but e&s;pecially in prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors: for though thou to a &s;ingle per&s;on was according to their accidence and grammar rules, and according to the bible, yet they could not bear to hear it; and becau&s;e I could not put off my hat to them, it &s;et them all into a rage. But the Lord &s;hewed me that it was an honour be|low, which he would lay in the du&s;t and &s;tain; an honour which proud fle&s;h looked for, but &s;ought not the honour which comes from God only. That it was an honour in|vented by men in the fall and in the alienation from God, who were offended if it was not given them; yet would be looked upon as &s;aints, church-members, and great Chri&s;|tians: but Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>How can ye believe, who receive honour one of another, and &s;eek not the honour that cometh from God only? And I (&s;aith Chri&s;t) receive not honour of men.</Q> Shewing that men have an honour which they will receive and give, but Chri&s;t will have none of it. This is the honour which Chri&s;t will not receive, and which mu&s;t be laid in the du&s;t. Oh! the &s;corn, heat, and fury that aro&s;e! Oh! the blows, punchings, beatings, and impri&s;onments that we underwent for not putting off our hats to men! For that &s;oon tried all mens patience and &s;obriety, what it was. Some had their hats violently pluck'd off and thrown away, &s;o that they quite lo&s;t them. The bad language and evil u&s;age we received on this ac|count is hard to be expre&s;&s;ed, be&s;ides the danger we were &s;ometimes in of lo&s;ing our lives for this matter, and that by the great profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianty, who thereby di&s;covered they were not true believers. And though it was but a &s;mall thing in the eye of man, yet a wonderful confu&s;ion it brought among all profe&s;&s;ors and prie&s;ts; but, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, many came to &s;ee the vanity of that cu&s;tom of putting off the hat to men, and felt the weight of Truth's te&s;timony again&s;t it.</P>
<P>About this time I was &s;orely exerci&s;ed in going to their courts to cry for ju&s;tice, in &s;peaking and writing to judges and ju&s;tices to do ju&s;tly; in warning &s;uch as kept publick hou&s;es for entertainment, that they &s;hould not let people
<PB N="31" REF="037441_0108_100D8E34F15A00B0">have more drink than would do them good; in te&s;tifying again&s;t wakes, fea&s;ts, may-games, &s;ports, plays, and &s;hews, which trained up people to vanity and loo&s;ene&s;s, and led them from the fear of God; and the days &s;et forth for holi|days were u&s;ually the times wherein they mo&s;t di&s;honoured God by the&s;e things. In fairs al&s;o, and in markets, I was made to declare again&s;t their deceitful merchandize, cheat|ing, and cozening; warning all to deal ju&s;tly, to &s;peak the truth, to let their yea be yea, and their nay be nay, and to do unto others as they would have others do unto them; forewarning them of the great and terrible day of the Lord, which would come upon them all. I was moved al&s;o to cry again&s;t all &s;orts of mu&s;ick, and again&s;t the mountebanks playing tricks on their &s;tages; for they burthened the pure life, and &s;tirred up people's minds to vanity. I was much exerci&s;ed too with &s;chool-ma&s;ters and &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, warning them to teach children &s;obriety in the fear of the Lord, that they might not be nur&s;ed and trained up in lightne&s;s, vanity, and wantonne&s;s. I was made to warn ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, fathers and mothers in private fami|lies, to take care that their children and &s;ervants might be trained up in the fear of the Lord, and that them&s;elves &s;hould be therein examples and patterns of &s;obriety and virtue to them. For I &s;aw that as the Jews were to teach their children the law of God, the old covenant, and to train them up in it, and their &s;ervants, yea the very &s;trangers were to keep the &s;abbath among them, and be circumci&s;ed, before they might eat of their &s;acrifices; &s;o all that made a profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity ought to train up their children and &s;ervants in the new covenant of light, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who is God's &s;alvation to the ends of the earth, that all may know their &s;alvation. And they ought to train them up in the law of life, the law of the Spirit, the law of love and of faith, that they might be made free from the law of &s;in and death. And all chri&s;tians ought to be circumci&s;ed by the Spirit, which puts off the body of the &s;ins of the fle&s;h, that they may come to eat of the heavenly &s;acrifice, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that true &s;piritual food, which none can rightly feed upon but they that are circumci&s;ed by the Spirit. Likewi&s;e I was exerci&s;ed about the &s;tar-gazers, who drew people's minds from Chri&s;t, the bright and the morning-&s;tar, and from the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, by whom the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, and all things el&s;e were made, who is the wi&s;dom of God, from whom the right knowledge of all things is received.</P>

But the black earthly &s;pirit of the prie&s;t wounded my life: and when I heard the bell toll to call people together to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, it &s;truck at my life; for it was like a market-bell to gather people together, that the prie&s;t might &s;et forth his ware to &s;ale. Oh! the va&s;t &s;ums of money that are got by the trade they make of &s;elling the &s;criptures, and by their preaching, from the highe&s;t bi&s;hop to the lowe&s;t prie&s;t!

But in this free Spirit of the Lord Je&s;us was I &s;ent forth to declare the word of life and reconciliation freely, that all might come to Chri&s;t, who gives freely, and renews up into the image of God, which man and woman were in before they fell, that they might &s;it down in the heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>As I went towards Nottingham on a fir&s;t-day in the morning, with friends to a meeting there, when I came on the top of a hill in &s;ight of the town, I e&s;pied the great &s;heeple-hou&s;e; and the Lord &s;aid unto me, <Q>Thou mu&s;t go cry again&s;t yonder great idol, and again&s;t the wor|&s;hippers therein.</Q> I &s;aid nothing of this to the friends, but went with them to the meeting, where the mighty pow|er of the Lord God was among&s;t us; in which I left friends &s;itting in the meeting, and went to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e. When I came there all the people looked like fallow ground, and the prie&s;t, like a great lump of earth, &s;tood in his pulpit above: he took for his text the&s;e words of Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r. <Q>We have al&s;o a more &s;ure word of prophecy, where unto ye do well, that ye take heed, as unto a light that &s;hineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-&s;tar ari&s;e in your hearts.</Q> He told the people this was the &s;criptures, by which they were to try all doctrines, religions, and opinions. Now the Lord's power was &s;o mighty upon me, and &s;o &s;trong in me, that I could not hold; but was made to cry out, <Q>Oh! no; it is not the &s;criptures;</Q> and told them it was the holy Spirit, by which the holy men of God gave forth the &s;criptures, whereby opinions, religions, and judgments were to be tried; for it led into all truth, and &s;o gave the knowledge of all truth. The Jews had the &s;criptures, yet re&s;i&s;ted the Holy Gho&s;t, and rejected Chri&s;t, the bright morning-&s;tar.
<PB N="33" REF="037441_0110_100D8E38F4C9BBA0">They per&s;ecuted him and his apo&s;tles, and took upon them to try their doctrines by the &s;criptures, but erred in judg|ment, and did not try them right; becau&s;e they tried without the Holy Gho&s;t. As I &s;poke thus among&s;t them, the offi|cers came, took me away, and put me into a na&s;ty &s;tinking pri&s;on; the &s;mell whereof got &s;o into my no&s;e and throat, that it very much annoyed me.</P>
<P>But that day the Lord's power &s;ounded &s;o in their ears, that they were amazed at the voice, and could not get it out of their ears for &s;ome time after; they were &s;o reached by the Lord's power in the &s;teeple-hou&s;e. At night they took me before the mayor, aldermen and &s;heriffs of the town. When I was brought before them, the mayor was in a peevi&s;h fretful temper, but the Lord's power allay'd him. They examined me at large; and I told them how the Lord had moved me to come. After &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e be|tween them and me, they &s;ent me back to pri&s;on; but &s;ome time after the head &s;heriff, who&s;e name was John Reckle&s;s, &s;ent for me to his hou&s;e. When I came in, his wife met me in the hall, and &s;aid, "Salvation is come to our hou&s;e." She took me by the hand, and was much wrought upon by the power of the Lord; and her hu&s;band, children, and &s;ervants were much changed, for the power of the Lord wrought upon them. I lodged at the &s;heriff's, and great meetings we had in his hou&s;e. Some per&s;ons of con&s;ider|able condition in the world came to them, and the Lord's power appeared eminently among&s;t them. This &s;heriff &s;ent for the other &s;heriff, and a woman they had had dealings with in the way of trade; and he told her before the other &s;heriff, that they had wronged her in their dealings with her (for the other &s;heriff and he were partners) and that they ought to make her re&s;titation. This he &s;poke cheerfully; but the other &s;heriff denied it, and the woman &s;aid &s;he knew nothing of it. But the friendly &s;heriff &s;aid it was &s;o, the other knew it well enough; and having di&s;covered the matter, and acknowledged the wrong done by them, he made re&s;titution to the woman, and exhorted the other &s;heriff to do the like. The Lord's power was with this friendly &s;heriff, wrought a mighty change in him, and great openings he had. The next market-day, as he was walk|ing with me in the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ruber, he &s;aid, <Q>I mu&s;t go into the market, and preach repentance to the people.</Q> Accord|ingly he went in his &s;lippers into the market, and into &s;eve|ral
<PB N="34" REF="037441_0111_100D8E3B408EF1C0">others al&s;o in the town were moved to &s;peak to the mayor and magi&s;trates, and to the people, exhorting them to re|pent. Hereupon the magi&s;trates grew very angry, &s;ent for me from the &s;heriff's hou&s;e and committed me to the com|mon pri&s;on. When the a&s;&s;ize came on, one per&s;on was mov|ed to come and offer up him&s;elf for me, body for body, yea, life al&s;o: but when I &s;hould have been brought before the judge, the &s;heriff's man being &s;omewhat long in bringing me to the &s;e&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e, the judge was ri&s;en before I came. At which I under&s;tood the judge was offended, and &s;aid, <Q>He would have admoni&s;hed the youth, if he had been brought before him:</Q> for I was then impri&s;oned by the name of a youth. So I was returned to pri&s;on again, and put into the common gaol. The Lord's power was great among friends; but the people began to be very rude: wherefore the governor of the ca&s;tle &s;ent &s;oldiers, and di&s;|per&s;ed them; after that they were quiet. Both prie&s;ts and people were a&s;toni&s;hed at the wonderful power that broke forth; &s;everal of the prie&s;ts were made tender, and &s;ome did confe&s;s to the power of the Lord.</P>
<P>After I was &s;et at liberty from Nottingham gaol, where I had been kept pri&s;oner a pretty long time, I travelled as before, in the work of the Lord. Coming to Mansfield Woodhou&s;e, there was a di&s;tracted woman under a doctor's hand, with her hair loo&s;e about her care. He was about to let her blood, &s;he being fir&s;t bound, and many people about her, holding her by violence; but he could get no blood from her. I de&s;ired them to unbind her and let her alone, for they could not touch the &s;pirit in her by which &s;he was tormented. So they did unbind her; and I was moved to &s;peak to her, and in the name of the Lord to bid her be quiet and &s;till; and &s;he was &s;o. The Lord's power &s;ettled her mind. and &s;he mended. Afterwards &s;he received the truth, and continued in it to her death; and the Lord's name was honoured; to whom the glory of all his works belongs. Many great and wonderful things were wrought by the heavenly power in tho&s;e days; for the Lord made bare his omnipotent arm, and manife&s;ted his power to the a&s;toni&s;hment of many; by the healing virtue whereof many have been delivered from great infirmities, and the devils were made &s;ubject through his name; of which particular in&s;tances might be given, beyond what this unbelieving age is able to receive or bear. Ble&s;&s;ed for ever be the name of the Lord, and everla&s;tingly honoured,
<PB N="35" REF="037441_0112_100D8E3CE30FFB90">and over all exalted and magnified be the arm of his glori|ous power, by which he hath wrought gloriou&s;ly: let the honour and prai&s;e of all his works be a&s;cribed to him alone.</P>
<P>While I was at Mansfield Woodhou&s;e, I was moved to go to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and declare the truth to the prie&s;t and people. But the people fell upon me in great rage, &s;truck me down, and almo&s;t &s;tifled me. I was cruelly beaten and brui&s;ed by them with their hands, bibles, and &s;ticks. Then they haled me out, though I was hardly able to &s;tand, and put me into the &s;tocks, where I &s;at &s;ome hours; and they brought dog-whips and hor&s;e-whips, threatening to whip me. After &s;ome time they had me before the magi&s;trate, at a knight's hou&s;e, where were many great per&s;ons; who, &s;eeing how evilly I had been u&s;ed, after much threatening &s;et me at liberty: but the rude peo|ple &s;toned me out of the town, for preaching the Word of life to them. I was &s;carce able to go, or well to &s;tand, by rea&s;on of the ill u&s;age I had received; yet with much ado I got about a mile from the town, and then I met with &s;ome people that gave me &s;omething to comfort me, becau&s;e I was inwardly brui&s;ed: but the Lord's power &s;oon healed me again. That day &s;ome people were convinced of the Lord's truth, and turned to his teaching; at which I re|joiced.</P>
<P>Then went I out of Nottingham&s;hire into Leice&s;ter&s;hire, &s;everal friends accompanying me. There were &s;ome bapti&s;ts in that country, whom I de&s;ired to &s;peak with, becau&s;e they were &s;eparated from the publick wor&s;hip. So Oats, one of their chief teachers, and others of the heads of them, with &s;everal of their company, came to meet us at Barrow, where we di&s;cour&s;ed with them. One of them &s;aid, What was not of faith, was &s;in. Whereupon I afked them, What Faith was? and how it was wrought in man? But they turned off from that, and &s;pake of their bapti&s;m in water. Then I a&s;ked them, Whether their mountain of &s;in was brought down, and laid low in them? and their rough and crooked ways made &s;mooth and &s;traight in them? They looked upon the &s;criptures as meaning outward moun|tains and ways; but I told them, they mu&s;t &s;ind them in their own hearts; which they &s;eemed to wonder at. We a&s;ked them, Who baptized John the bapti&s;t? who baptized Peter, John, and the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles? and put them to prove by &s;cripture, that the&s;e were baptized in water: but they were &s;ilent, Then I a&s;ked them, Seeing Judas,

But they could not tell what to make of this, nor what to &s;ay to it. So after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e we parted; and &s;ome of them were loving to us.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t-day following we came to Bagworth, and went to a &s;teeple-hou&s;e, where &s;ome friends were got in, and the people locked them in, and them&s;elves too, with the prie&s;t. But after the prie&s;t had done, they opened the door, and we went in al&s;o, and had &s;ervice for the Lord among&s;t them. Afterwards we had a meeting in the town, among&s;t &s;everal that were in high notions. Then pa&s;&s;ing from thence, I heard of a people in pri&s;on at Coventry for re|ligion. As I walked towards the gaol, the word of the Lord came to me &s;aying, MY LOVE WAS ALWAYS TO THEE, AND THOU ART IN MY LOVE. And I was ra|vi&s;hed with the &s;en&s;e of the love of God, and greatly &s;trengthened in my inward man. But when I came into the gaol where tho&s;e pri&s;oners were, a great power of dark|ne&s;s &s;truck at me; and I &s;at &s;till, having my &s;pirit gathered into the love of God. At la&s;t the&s;e pri&s;oners began to rant, vapour and bla&s;pheme; at which my &s;oul was greatly griev|ed. They &s;aid, they were God; but we could not bear &s;uch things. When they were calm, I &s;tood up and a&s;ked them, Whether they did &s;uch things by motion, or from Scripture? They &s;aid, From Scripture. Then a bible lying by, I a&s;ked them for that &s;cripture; and they &s;hewed me that place where the &s;heet was let down to Peter; and it was &s;aid to him, what was &s;anctified he &s;hould not call common or unclean. When I had &s;hewed them That &s;cripture made nothing for their purpo&s;e, they brought another, which &s;pake of God's reconciling all things to him&s;elf, things in heaven and things in earth. I told them I owned that &s;cripture al&s;o; but &s;hewed them it was nothing to their purpo&s;e neither. Them &s;eeing they &s;aid, They were God, I a&s;ked them, If they knew whether it would rain to mor|row? They &s;aid, They could not tell. I told them, God could tell. I a&s;ked them, If they thought they &s;hould be always in that condition, or &s;hould change? They an&s;wer|ed.
<PB N="37" REF="037441_0114_100D8E4264C99658">They could not tell. Then &s;aid I, God can tell, and he doth not change. You &s;ay you are God; at I yet you cannot tell whether you &s;hall change or no. So they were con&s;ounded, and quite brought down for the time. After I had reproved them for their bla&s;phemous expre&s;&s;ions, I went away; for I perceived they were Ranters. I had met with none before; and I admired the goodne&s;s of the Lord in appearing &s;o unto me, before I went among&s;t them. Not long after this, one of the&s;e Ranters, who&s;e name was Jo|&s;eph Salmon, publi&s;hed a recantation; upon which they were &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>From Coventry I went to Ather&s;tone; and it being their lecture-day, I was moved to go to their chapel to &s;peak to the prie&s;t and people. They were generally pretty quiet; only &s;ome &s;ew raged, and would have had my relations to have bound me. I declared largely to them, that God was come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his people him&s;elf, and to bring them from all their man-made teachers, to hear his Son; and &s;ome were con|vinced there.</P>
<P>Then I went to Market-Bo&s;&s;oth, and there was a lecture al&s;o. He that preached was Nathaniel Stevens, the prie&s;t of the town where I was born. He raged much when I &s;pake, and told the people I was mad; though he had &s;aid before to Colonel Purfoy, There was never &s;uch a plant bred in England: he bid the people not to hear me; who, being &s;tirred up by this deceitful prie&s;t, fell upon us, and &s;toned us out of the town: yet they did not do us much hurt. Howbeit &s;ome people were made loving that day; and others were confirmed, &s;eeing the rage of both prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors; and &s;ome cried out, that the prie&s;t dur&s;t not &s;tand to prove his mini&s;try.</P>
<P>As I travelled through markets, fairs, and divers places, I &s;aw death and darkne&s;s in all people, where the power of the Lord had not &s;haken them. As I was pa&s;&s;ing on in leice&s;ter&s;hire, I came to Twy-Cro&s;s, where there were ex|ci&s;emen. I was moved of the Lord to go and warn them to take heed of oppre&s;&s;ing the poor; and people were much affected with it. There was in that town a great man that had long lain &s;ick, and was given over by the phy&s;icians. Some friends in the town de&s;ired me to vi&s;it him. I went up to him in his chamber, and &s;pake the word of life to him, and was moved to pray by him; and the Lord was entreated, and re&s;tored him to health. When I was come down the &s;tairs into a lower room, and was &s;peaking to the
<PB N="38" REF="037441_0115_100D8E44592C5DD0">&s;ervants, and others there, a &s;ervant man of his came raving out of another room, with a naked rapier in his hand, and &s;et it ju&s;t to my &s;ide. I looked &s;teadfa&s;tly on him, and &s;aid, <Q>Alack for thee, poor creature! what wilt thou do with thy carnal weapon? It is no more to me than a &s;traw.</Q> The &s;tanders-by were much troubled, and he went away in a rage. But when the news of it came to his ma&s;ter, he turned him out of his &s;ervice. Thus the Lord's power pre&s;erved me, and rai&s;ed up the, weak man; who afterwards was very loving to friends. When I came to that town again, both he and his wife came to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>After this I was moved to go into Derby&s;hire, where the mighty power of God was among friends. I went to Che&s;|terfield, where one Britland was prie&s;t. He &s;aw beyond the common &s;ort of prie&s;ts; for he had been partly convin|ced, and had &s;poken much on behalf of truth before he was prie&s;t there: but when the prie&s;t of that town died, he got the par&s;onage, and choked him&s;elf with it. I was mo|ved to &s;peak to him and the people in the great love of God, that they might come off from all men's teaching un|to God's teaching; and he was not able to gain&s;ay. But they had me before the mayor, and threatened to &s;end me, with &s;ome others, to the hou&s;e of correction; and kept us in cu&s;tody till it was late in the night. Then the officers with the watchmen, put us out of the town, leaving us to &s;hift as we could. I bent my cour&s;e towards Derby, hav|ing a friend or two with me. In our way we met with ma|ny profe&s;&s;ors; and at Kid&s;ey Park many were convinced.</P>
<P>Coming to Derby, I lay at a doctor's hou&s;e, who&s;e wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> was convinced; and &s;everal more in the town. As I was walking in my chamber, the bell rung; and it &s;truck at my life at the very hearing of it. So I a&s;ked the woman of the hou&s;e, What the bell rung for? She &s;aid, There was to be a great lecture there that day, and many officers of the ar|my, prie&s;ts, and preachers, were to be there, and a colonel, that was a preacher. Then was I moved of the Lord to go up to them. When they had done, I &s;pake to them what the Lord commanded me; and they were pretty quiet. But there came an officer, and took me by the hand, and &s;aid, I mu&s;t go before the magi&s;trates, and the other two that were with me. It was about the fir&s;t hour after noon that we came before them. They alked me, Why we came thither? I &s;aid, God moved us &s;o to do; and told them, "God dwells not in temples made with hands." I
<PB N="39" REF="037441_0116_100D8E45F39C3438">al&s;o &s;aid, All their preaching, bapti&s;m, and &s;acrifices would never &s;anctify them; and bid them look unto Chri&s;t in them, and not unto men; for it is Chri&s;t that &s;ancti&s;ies. Then they ran into many words; but I told them they were not to di&s;pute of God and Chri&s;t, but to obey him. The power of God thundered among them, and they did fly like chaff before it. They put me in and out of the room often, hurrying me backward and forward, for they were from the fir&s;t hour till the ninth at night in examining me. Sometimes they would tell me in a deriding manner, that I was taken up in raptures. At la&s;t they a&s;ked me, Whether I was &s;anctified? I an&s;wered, Yes; for I was in the paradi&s;e of God. Then they a&s;ked me, If I had no &s;in? I an&s;wered, Chri&s;t my Saviour has taken away my &s;in; and in him there is no &s;in. They a&s;ked, How we knew that Chri&s;t did abide in us? I &s;aid, By his Spirit that he hath given us. They temptingly a&s;ked, If any of us were Chri&s;t? I an&s;wered, Nay, we were nothing, Chri&s;t was all. They &s;aid, If a man &s;teal, is it no &s;in? I an&s;wered, All unright|eou&s;ne&s;s is &s;in. When they had wearied them&s;elves in exa|mining me, they committed me and one other man to the hou&s;e of correction in Derby for &s;ix months, as bla&s;|phemers; as may appear by the mittimus, a copy whereof here followeth:</P>

I replied, If ye are true believers in Chri&s;t, you are pa&s;&s;ed from death to life; and if pa&s;&s;ed from death, then from &s;in that bringeth death: and if your faith be true, it will give you victory over &s;in and the devil, puri&s;y your hearts and con&s;ciences (for the true faith is held in a pure con&s;cience) and bring you to plea&s;e God, and give you acce&s;s to him again. But they could not endure to hear of purity, and of victory over &s;in and the devil. They &s;aid, <Q>They could not believe any could be free from &s;in on this &s;ide the grave.</Q> I bid them give over babbling about the &s;criptures, which were holy men's words, whil&s;t they plead|ed for unholine&s;s. At another time a company of profe&s;&s;ors came, who al&s;o began to plead for &s;in. I a&s;ked them, Whether they had hope? They &s;aid. Yes: God forbid but we &s;hould have hope. I a&s;ked them, What hope is it that you have? Is Chri&s;t in you the hope of your glory? Doth it purify you, as he is pure? But they could not abide to hear of being made pure here. Then I bid them forbear talking of the &s;criptures, which were the holy men's words; for the holy men that wrote the &s;criptures pleaded for holine&s;s in heart, life, and conver&s;ation here; but &s;ince you plead for impurity and &s;in, which is of the devil, what have you to do with the holy men's words?</P>
<P>The keeper of the pri&s;on, being an high profe&s;&s;or, was greatly enraged again&s;t me, and &s;poke very wickedly of me; but it plea&s;ed the Lord one day to &s;trike him &s;o, that he was in great trouble, and under much terror of mind. And as I was walking in my chamber, I heard a doleful noi&s;e; and &s;tanding &s;till, I heard him &s;ay to his wife, <Q>Wife, I have &s;een the day of judgment; and I &s;aw GEORGE there, and I was afraid of him; becau&s;e I had done him &s;o much wrong, and &s;poken &s;o much again&s;t him to the mini&s;ters and profe&s;&s;ors, and to the ju&s;tices, and in taverns and alchou&s;es.</Q> After this, towards the evening, he came into my chamber, and &s;aid to me, <Q>I have been as a lion again&s;t you; but now I come like a lamb, and like the gaoler that came to Paul and Silas trembling.</Q> And he de&s;ired he might lodge with me; I told him, I was in his power, he might do what he would: but he &s;aid, <Q>Nay, he would have my leave; and he could de&s;ire to be always with me, but not to have me as a pri&s;oner.</Q> He &s;aid,
<PB N="46" REF="037441_0123_100D8E564B77C698"><Q>He had been plagued, and his hou&s;e had been plagued for my &s;ake.</Q> So I &s;uffered him to lodge with me. Then he told me all his heart, and &s;aid, He believed what I had &s;aid of the true faith and hope to be true; and he wondered that the other man, who was put in pri&s;on with me, did not &s;tand it; and &s;aid, <Q>That man was not right, but I was an hone&s;t man.</Q> He confe&s;&s;ed al&s;o to me, that at tho&s;e times when I had a&s;ked him to let me go forth to &s;peak the word of the Lord to the people, when he refu&s;ed to let me go, and I laid the weight thereof upon him, that he u&s;ed to be under great trouble, amazed, and almo&s;t di&s;tracted for &s;ome time after, and in &s;uch a condi|tion that he had little &s;trength left him. When the morn|ing came, he ro&s;e and went to the ju&s;tices, and told them, "That he and his hou&s;e had been plagued for my &s;ake." One of the ju&s;tices replied (as he reported to me) that the plagues were upon them too for keeping me. This was ju&s;tice Bennet of Derby, who was the fir&s;t that called us Quakers, becau&s;e I bid them tremble at the word of the Lord. This was in the year 1650.</P>
<P>After this the ju&s;tices gave leave, that I &s;hould have liberty to walk a mile. I perceived their end, and told the gaoler. If they would &s;et down to me how far a mile was, I might take the liberty of walking it &s;ometimes. For I had a &s;en&s;e that they thought I would go away. And the gaoler confe&s;&s;ed afterwards they did it with that intent to have me go away, to ea&s;e them of their plague; but I told him I was not of that &s;pirit.</P>
<P>This gaoler had a &s;i&s;ter, a &s;ickly young woman. She came up into my chamber to vi&s;it me; and after &s;he had &s;taid &s;ome time, and I had &s;poken the words of truth to her, &s;he went down, and told them, <Q>we were an inno|cent people, and did none any hurt, but did good to all, even to them that hated us;</Q> and de&s;ired them to be tender towards me.</P>
<P>As by rea&s;on of my re&s;traint I had not the opportunity of travelling about to declare and &s;pread truth through the countries, it came upon me to write a paper, and &s;end it forth to be &s;pread among&s;t friends and other tender people, for the opening of their under&s;tandings in the way of truth, and directing them to the true teacher in them&s;elves. It was after this manner:</P>

<PB N="47" REF="037441_0124_100D8E588701E648">be brought to &s;ee his evil thoughts, running mind, and vain imaginations, and may &s;trive to keep them down, and to keep his mind in; but cannot overcome them, nor keep his mind within to the Lord. In this &s;tate and con|dition &s;ubmit to the Spirit of the Lord that &s;hews them, and that will bring to wait upon the Lord; and he that hath di&s;covered them will de&s;troy them. Therefore &s;tand in the faith of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t (who is the author of the true faith) and mind him; for he will di&s;cover the root of lu&s;ts, evil thoughts, and vain imaginations; how they are begotten, conceived, and bred; how they are brought forth, and how every evil member doth work. He will di&s;cover every principle from its own nature and root.</P>
<P>So mind the faith of Chri&s;t, and the anointing which is in you, to be taught by it, which will di&s;cover all work|ings in you. As he teacheth you, &s;o obey and for&s;ake; el&s;e you will not grow in the faith, nor in the life of Chri&s;t, where the love of God is received. Love beget|teth love, its own nature and image: and when mercy and truth meet, what joy there is! Mercy triumphs in judg|ment; and love and mercy bear the judgment of the world in patience. That which cannot bear the world's judg|ment is not the love of God; for love beareth all things, and is above the world's judgment; for the world's judg|ment is but fooli&s;hne&s;s. Though it be the world's judg|ment and practice to ca&s;t all the filthine&s;s that is among them&s;elves upon the &s;aints, yet their judgment is fal&s;e. The cha&s;te virgins follow Chri&s;t the lamb, that takes away the &s;ins of the world; but they that are of that &s;pirit which is not cha&s;te, will not follow Chri&s;t the lamb in his &s;teps, but are di&s;obedient to him in his commands. The fle&s;hly mind doth mind the fle&s;h, talketh fle&s;hly, and its know|ledge is fle&s;hly, and not &s;piritual; but &s;avours of death, not of the Spirit of life. Some men have the nature of &s;wine wallowing in the mire. Some have the nature of dogs, to bite both the &s;heep and one another. Some have the nature of lions, to tear, devour, and de&s;troy. Some the nature of wolves, to tear and devour the lambs and &s;heep of Chri&s;t: and &s;ome the nature of the &s;erpent (that old adver&s;ary) to &s;ting, envenom, and poi&s;on. <Q>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear,</Q> and learn the&s;e things within him&s;elf. Some men have the natures of other bea&s;ts and creatures, minding nothing but earthly and vi|&s;ible things, and feeding without the fear of God. Some
<PB N="48" REF="037441_0125_100D8E5A37305778">have the nature of a hor&s;e, to prance and vapour in their &s;trength, and to be &s;wift in doing evil. Some have the nature of tall &s;turdy oaks, to flouri&s;h and &s;pread in wi&s;|dom and &s;trength, who are &s;trong in evil, which mu&s;t pe|ri&s;h and come to the fire. Thus evil is but one in all, but worketh many ways; and what&s;oever a man or wo|man's nature is addicted to that is outward, the evil one will &s;uit him, and plea&s;e his nature and appetite, to keep his mind in his inventions, and in the creatures from the Cre|ator. O therefore let not the mind go from God; for if it do, it will be &s;tained, venomed, and corrupted. If the mind go forth from the Lord, it is hard to bring it in again: therefore take heed of the enemy, and keep in the faith of Chri&s;t. Oh! therefore mind that which is eternal and invi&s;ible, and him who is the Creator and Mover of all things: for the things that are made, are not made of things that appear; for the vi&s;ible covereth the invi&s;ible &s;ight in you. But as the Lord, who is invi&s;ible, doth open you by his invi&s;ible power and &s;pirit, and brings down the carnal mind in you; &s;o the invi&s;ible and immor|tal things are brought to light in you. O therefore you that know the light, walk in the light! for there are chil|dren of darkne&s;s that will talk of the light, and of the truth, yet not walk in it; but the children of light love the light, and walk in the light. But the children of darkne&s;s walk in darkne&s;s, and hate the light. In them the earthly lu&s;ts and carnal mind choke the &s;eed of faith, which bringeth oppre&s;&s;ion on the &s;eed, and death over them&s;elves. O therefore mind the pure Spirit of the ever|la&s;ting God, which will teach you to u&s;e the creatures in, their right place, and which judgeth the evil. <Q>To thee, O God, be all glory and honour, who art Lord of all vi&s;ibles and invi&s;ibles! To thee be all prai&s;e, who bringe&s;t out of the deep to thy&s;elf; O powerful God, who art worthy of all glory!</Q> For the Lord who created all, and "gives life and &s;trength to all, is over all and merciful to all. <Q>So thou, who ha&s;t made all, and art over all, to thee be all glory! In thee is my &s;trength, refre&s;hment, and life, my joy and my gladne&s;s, my rejoicing and glorying for evermore!</Q> To live and walk in the Spirit of God is joy, peace, and life; but the mind going forth into the creatures, or into any vi&s;ible things from the Lord, this bringeth death. When the mind is got into the fle&s;h, and into death, the accu&s;er gets within, and the law of &s;in and
<PB N="49" REF="037441_0126_100D8E5D59AFF168">death gets into the fle&s;h. Then the life &s;uffers under the law of &s;in and death, and then there is &s;traitne&s;s and fail|ings. For then the good is &s;hut up, and the &s;elf-righte|ou&s;ne&s;s is &s;et atop. Then man doth work in the outward law, though he cannot ju&s;tify him&s;elf by the law, but is condemned by the light: for he cannot get out of that &s;tate, but by abiding in the light, re&s;ting in the mercy of God, and believing in him from whom all mercy flows. For there is peace in re&s;ting in the Lord Je&s;us. This is the narrow way that leads to him, the life; but few will abide in it. Keep in the innocency, and be obedient to the faith in him. Take heed of conforming to the world, and of rea&s;oning with fle&s;h and blood, for that bringeth di&s;obedience; and then imaginations and que&s;tionings ari&s;e, to draw from obedience to the truth of Chri&s;t. But the obedience of faith de&s;troyeth imaginations, que&s;tion|ings. and rea&s;onings, with all the temptations in the fle&s;h, buffetings, lookings forth, and fetching up things that are pa&s;t. But, not keeping in the life and light, not cro&s;&s;ing the corrupt will by the power of God, the evil nature grows up in man; then burdens will come, and man will be &s;tained with that nature. But E&s;au's mountain &s;hall be laid wa&s;te, and become a wilderne&s;s, where the dragons lie; but Jacob, the &s;econd birth, &s;hall be fruitful and &s;hall ari&s;e. For E&s;au is hated, and mu&s;t not be lord; but Jacob, the &s;econd birth, which is perfect and plain, &s;hall be lord; for he is beloved of God.</P>

So I was had up before the ju&s;tices; and becau&s;e I would not con&s;ent that they or any &s;hould be bound for me (for I was innocent from any ill behaviour. and had &s;poken the word of life and truth unto them) ju&s;|tice Bennet ro&s;e up in a range; and as I was kneeling down to pray to the Lord to forgive him, he ran upon me, and &s;truck me with both his hands, crying, <Q>away with him, gaoler: take him away, gaoler.</Q> Whereupon I was had again to pri&s;on, and there kept, till the time of my com|mitment for &s;ix months was expired. But I had now the liberty of walking a mile by my&s;elf; which I made u&s;e of as I felt freedom. Sometimes I went into the market and &s;treets, and warned the people to repent of their wicked|ne&s;s; and returned to pri&s;on again.

Every tree &s;hews its fruit: the mini&s;try of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is in mercy and love, to loo&s;e them that are bound, to bring out of bondage, and to let them that are captivated go free. Now, friends, where is your example, if the &s;crip|tures be your rule, to impri&s;on for religion? Have you any command for it from Chri&s;t? If that were in you, which you profe&s;s, you would walk in their &s;teps who &s;pake the &s;criptures. But he is not a Jew who is one outward, who&s;e prai&s;e is of Men; but he is a Jew who is one inward, who&s;e prai&s;e is of God.

Love the cro&s;s; &s;atisfy not your own minds in the fle&s;h; but prize your time while you have it. and walk up to that you know, in obedience to God; then you &s;hall not be condemned for that you know not, but for that you know, and do not obey.

So con&s;ider, Evil communication corrupts good manners. Be not deceived, God will not be mocked with vain words; the wrath of God is revealed from heaven again&s;t all ungodline&s;s. Therefore obey that which convinceth you of all evil, and telleth you that you &s;hould do no, evil: it will lead to re|pentance, and keep you in the fear of the Lord.

Thou knowe&s;t thou &s;hould&s;t do none of the&s;e things; thou ha&s;t learned that which will condemn thee; therefore obey the light which doth convince thee, for&s;ake thy &s;ins, look at the mercies of God and prize his love in &s;paring thee till now. The Lord &s;aith, <Q>Look unto me, all ye ends of the earth, and be ye &s;aved;</Q> and <Q>Cea&s;e from man, who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils.</Q> Friend, prize thy time, and &s;ee whom thou &s;erve&s;t; for his &s;ervant thou art whom thou do&s;t obey, whether of &s;in unto death, or obedience unto right|eou&s;ne&s;s. If thou &s;erve&s;t God and feare&s;t him, thou wilt not bla&s;pheme his name, nor cur&s;e, nor &s;wear, nor take his name in vain, nor follow plea&s;ures and wantonne&s;s, whoredom and drunkenne&s;s or wrath, or malice, or revenge, or ra&s;hne&s;s, or headine&s;s, pride or gluttony, greedine&s;s, oppre&s;&s;ion or covetou&s;ne&s;s, or fooli&s;h je&s;ting, or vain &s;ongs; God doth forbid the&s;e things, and all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. If thou profe&s;&s;e&s;t God, and acte&s;t any of the&s;e things, thou take&s;t him for a cloak, and &s;erve&s;t the devil. Con&s;ider with thy&s;elf, and do not love that which God hateth. He that loveth God keepeth his commandments. The devil will tell thee, It is an hard thing to keep God's command|ments; but it is an ea&s;y thing to keep the devil's com|mandments, and to live in all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and ungod|line&s;s, turning the grace of God into wantonne&s;s. But let the unrighteous man for&s;ake his ways, and turn unto me, &s;aith the Lord, and I will have mercy; <Q>Turn ye, why will ye die? &s;aith the Lord.</Q></P>

<P>While I was in the hou&s;e of correction, there came a trooper, and &s;aid, As he was &s;itting in the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, hearing the prie&s;t, exceeding great trouble fell upon him; and the voice of the Lord came to him, &s;aying, <Q>Do&s;t thou not know that my &s;ervant is in pri&s;on? Go to him for di|rection.</Q> So I &s;pake to his condition, and his under|&s;tanding was opened. I told him, That which &s;hewed him his &s;ins, and troubled him for them, would &s;hew him his &s;alvation; for he that &s;hews a man his &s;in, is the &s;ame that takes it away. While I was &s;peaking to him, the Lord's power opened him &s;o that he began to have a good under|&s;tanding in the Lord's truth, and to be &s;en&s;ible of God's mercies. He &s;poke boldly in his quarters among&s;t the &s;oldiers, and to others, concerning truth (for the &s;criptures were very much opened to him) in&s;omuch that he &s;aid, <Q>His colonel was a blind as Nebuchadnezzar, to ca&s;t the &s;ervant of the Lord into pri&s;on.</Q> Upon this, his colonel conceived a &s;pite again&s;t him: and at Worce&s;ter fight the year after, when the two armies lay near one another, two came out from the king's army, and challenged any two of the parliament army to fight with them; his colonel made choice of him and another to an&s;wer the challenge. And when in the encounter his companion was &s;lain, he drove both his enemies within mu&s;ket-&s;hot of the town, without &s;iring a pi&s;tol at them. This, when he returned, he told me with his own mouth. But when the &s;ight was over, he &s;aw the deceit and hypocri&s;y of the officers; and being &s;en&s;ible how wonderfully the Lord had pre&s;erved him, and &s;eeing al&s;o to the end of fighting, he laid down his arms.</P>
<P>The time of my commitment to the hou&s;e of correction be|ing very near out, and there being many new &s;oldiers rai&s;ed, the commi&s;&s;ioners would have made me captain over them; and the &s;oldiers cried, They would have none but me. So the keeper of the hou&s;e of correction was commanded to
<PB N="56" REF="037441_0133_100D8E6BEEF73950">bring me before the commi&s;&s;ioners and &s;oldiers in the mar|ket-place; where they offered me that preferment, as they called it, a&s;kingme, If I would not take up arms for the com|monwealth again&s;t Charles Stewart? I told them I knew from whence all wars aro&s;e, even from the lu&s;ts, according to James's doctrine; and that I lived in the virtue of that life and power that took away the occa&s;ion of all wars. Yet they courted me to accept of their offer, and thought I did but compliment them. But I told them I was come into the covenant of peace, which was before wars and &s;trifes were. They &s;aid, They offered it in love and kindne&s;s to me, be|cau&s;e of my virtue; and &s;uch-like flattering words they u&s;ed. But I told them, If that was their love and kind|ne&s;s, I trampled it under my feet. Then their rage got up, and they &s;aid, <Q>Take him away, Gaoler, and put him into the pri&s;on among&s;t the rogues and felons.</Q> So I was put into a lou&s;y &s;tinking place, without any bed, among&s;t thirty felons, where I was kept almo&s;t half a year; yet at times they would het me walk to the garden, believing I would not go away. When they had got me into Derby pri|&s;on, it was the &s;aying of people that I &s;hould never come out; but I had faith in God that I &s;hould be delivered in his time: for the Lord had given me to believe that I was not to be removed from that place yet, being &s;et there for a &s;ervice which he had for me to do.</P>
<P>After it was bruited abroad that I was in Derby pri&s;on, my relations came to &s;ee me again; and were much trou|bled that I &s;hould be in pri&s;on; for they looked upon it to be a great &s;hame to them for me to lie in gaol. It was a &s;trange thing then to be impri&s;oned for religion; and &s;ome thought I was mad, becau&s;e I &s;tood for purity, righteou&s;|ne&s;s and perfection.</P>
<P>Among others that came to &s;ee and di&s;cour&s;e with me, there was a certain per&s;on from Nottingham, a &s;oldier, who had been a bapti&s;t, as I under&s;tood, and with him came &s;everal others. In di&s;cour&s;e, this per&s;on &s;aid to me, <Q>Your faith &s;tands in a man that died at Jeru&s;alem, and there never was any &s;uch thing.</Q> Being exceedingly grieved to hear him, I &s;aid, <Q>How! did not Chri&s;t &s;uffer without the gates of Jeru&s;alem, through the profe&s;&s;ing Jews, chief prie&s;ts, and Pilate?</Q> He denied that ever Chri&s;t &s;uf|fered there outwardly. Then I a&s;ked him, Whether there were not chief prie&s;t, and Jews, and Pilate there outward|ly? When he could not deny that, I told him, As cer|tainly
<PB N="57" REF="037441_0134_100D8E6DE1406F98">as there was a chief prie&s;t, and Jews and Pilate there outwardly, &s;o certainly was Chri&s;t per&s;ecuted by them, and did &s;uffer there outwardly under them, Yet from this man's words was a &s;tander rai&s;ed upon us, That the Quakers &s;hould deny Chri&s;t, that &s;uffered and died at Jeru&s;alem: which was all utterly fal&s;e; the lea&s;t thought of it never entered our hearts. The &s;ame per&s;on al&s;o &s;aid. That never any of the prophets, nor apo&s;tles, nor holy men of God, &s;uffered any thing outwardly, but all their &s;ufferings were inward. I in&s;tanced to him many of the prophets and apo&s;tles, how and by whom they &s;uffered. So the power of the Lord was brought over his wicked imaginations and whim&s;ies.</P>
<P>There came al&s;o another company to me, that pretended they were triers of &s;pirits: I a&s;ked them, What was the fir&s;t &s;tep to peace? And what it was by which a man might &s;ee his &s;alvation? They were pre&s;ently up in the airy mind, and &s;aid, I was mad. Thus they came to try &s;pirits, who did not know them&s;elves nor their own &s;pirits.</P>
<P>In this time of my impri&s;onment I was exceedingly ex|erci&s;ed about the proceedings of the judges and magi&s;trates in their courts of judicature, and was moved to write to the judges concerning their putting men to death for &s;mall mat|ters; and to &s;hew them how contrary it was to the law of God in old time; for I was under great &s;uffering in my &s;pirit becau&s;e of it, and under the very &s;en&s;e of death; but &s;tanding in the will of God, an heavenly breathing aro&s;e in my &s;oul to the Lord. Then did I &s;ee the heavens open|ed, and I rejoiced, and gave glory to God. So I wrote to the judges in manner following:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I AM moved to write unto you, to take heed of putting men to death for &s;tealing cattle, or money, &amp;c. for thieves in old time were to make re&s;titution; and if they had not wherewith, they were to be &s;old for their theft. Mind the laws of God in the &s;criptures, and the Spirit that gave them forth; let them be your rule in exe|cuting judgment; and &s;hew mercy, that you may receive mercy from God, the judge of all. Take heed of gifts and rewards, and of pride; for God doth forbid them, and they blind the eyes of the wi&s;e. I do not write to give li|berty to &s;in, God hath forbidden it; but that you &s;hould judge according to his laws, and &s;hew mercy; for he de|lighteth in true judgment, and in mercy. I be&s;eech you,
<PB N="58" REF="037441_0135_100D8E7010C99798">mind the&s;e things, prize your time, now you have it; fear God, and &s;erve him, for he is a con&s;uming fire.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Be&s;ides this, I wrote another letter to the judges, to this effect:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I AM moved to write unto you, that ye do true ju&s;tice to every man; &s;ee that none be oppre&s;&s;ed nor wronged, nor any oaths impo&s;ed; for the land mourneth becau&s;e of oaths, adulteries, forceries, drunkenne&s;s, and prophane|ne&s;s. O con&s;ider, ye that are in authority: be moderate, and in lowline&s;s con&s;ider the&s;e things. Shew mercy to the fatherle&s;s, to the widows, and to the poor. Take heed of rewards or gifts, for they blind the eyes of the wi&s;e; the Lord doth loath all &s;uch. Love mercy and true judg|ment, ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s; for the Lord delighteth in &s;uch. Con&s;ider the&s;e things in time, and take heed how ye &s;pend your time. Now ye have time, prize it; and &s;hew mercy, that ye may receive mercy from the Lord: for he is coming to try all things, and will plead with all fle&s;h as by fire.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Moreover, I laid before the judges what an hurtful thing it was that pri&s;oners &s;hould lie &s;o long in gaol; &s;hewing how they learned wickedne&s;s one of another, in talking of their bad deeds; therefore &s;peedy ju&s;tice &s;hould be done. For I was a tender youth, and dwelt in the fear of God; and being grieved to hear their bad language, I was often made to reprove them for their wicked words, and evil car|riage towards each other. People admired that I was &s;o pre&s;erved and kept; for they never could catch a word or action from me, to make any thing of again&s;t me, all the time I was there; for the Lord's infinite power upheld and pre&s;erved me all that time; to him be prai&s;es and glo|ry for ever!</P>
<P>While I was here, there was a young, woman in the gaol for robbing her ma&s;ter. When &s;he was to be tried for her life, I wrote to the judge and jury, &s;hewing them how contrary it was to the law of God in old time to put people to death for &s;tealing; and moving them to &s;hew mercy. Yet &s;he was condemned to die, and a grave was made for her; and at the time appointed &s;he was carried forth to execution. Then I wrote a few words, warning all to beware of greedi|ne&s;s or covetou&s;ne&s;s, for it leads from God; and that all &s;hould fear the Lord, avoid earthly lu&s;ts, and prize their
<PB N="59" REF="037441_0136_100D8E71A4AB2560">time while they have it: this I gave to be read at the gal|lows. And though they had her upon the ladder, with a cloth bound over her face, ready to be turned off. yet they did not put her to death, but brought her back to pri&s;on, where &s;he afterwards came to be convinced of God's ever|la&s;ting truth.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o in the gaol, while I was there, a wicked ungodly man who was reputed a conjurer. He threatened he would talk with me, and what he would do; but he never had power to open his mouth to me. And the gaoler and he falling out, he threatened to rai&s;e the devil, and break his hou&s;e down; &s;o that he made the gaoler afraid. I was moved of the Lord to go in his power and rebuke him, and to &s;ay to him <Q>Come, let's &s;ee what thou can&s;t do; do thy wor&s;t.</Q> I told him <Q>The devil was rai&s;ed high enough in him already; but the power of God chained him down;</Q> &s;o he &s;lunk away from me.</P>
<P>The time of Worce&s;ter fight coming on, ju&s;tice Bennet &s;ent con&s;tables to pre&s;s me for a &s;oldier, &s;eeing I would not voluntarily accept of a command. I told them, that I was brought off from outward wars. They came again to give me pre&s;s-money; but I would take none. Then I was brought up to &s;erjeant Holes, kept there awhile, and taken down again. Afterwards the con&s;tables brought me a &s;e|cond time before the commi&s;&s;ioners, who &s;aid I &s;hould go for a &s;oldier; but I told them I was dead to it. They &s;aid I was alive. I told them, where envy and hatred is, there is confu&s;ion. They offered me money twice, but I refu&s;ed it. Being di&s;appointed, they were angry, and committed me clo&s;e pri&s;oner, without bail or mainprize. Whereupon I wrote to them again, directing my letter to colonel Bar|ton, a preacher, and the re&s;t that were concerned in my commitment. I wrote thus:</P>

<P>About this time I was moved to give forth the following lines, to go among&s;t the convinced and tender people, to manife&s;t the deceits of the world, and how the prie&s;ts have deceived the people.</P>
<P>To all that love the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t with a pure and naked heart, and the generation of the righteous.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>CHRIST was ever hated; and the righteous for his &s;ake. Mind who they were that did ever hate them. He that was born after the fle&s;h per&s;ecuted him that was born after the Spirit; &s;o it is now. Mind who were the chiefe&s;t again&s;t Chri&s;t; even the great learned men, the heads of the people, rulers, and teachers, that profe&s;&s;ed the law and the prophets, and looked for Chri&s;t. They looked for an outwardly-glorious Chri&s;t, to hold up their outward glory; but Chri&s;t &s;poke again&s;t the works of the world, and again&s;t the prie&s;ts, &s;cribes, and phari&s;ees, and their hypocritical profe&s;&s;ion. He that is a &s;tranger to Chri&s;t, is an hireling; but the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t are free men. Fal&s;e teachers always laid burdens upon the peo|ple; and the true &s;ervants of the Lord declared again&s;t them. Jeremiah &s;poke again&s;t hirelings, and &s;aid. It was an horrible thing; and, What will ye do in the end? For the people and prie&s;ts were given to covetou&s;ne&s;s. Paul &s;poke again&s;t &s;uch as made gain upon the people, and ex|horted the &s;aints to turn away from &s;uch as were covetous and proud, &s;uch as loved plea&s;ures more than God, &s;uch as had a form of godline&s;s, but denied the power thereof. "For of this &s;ort;", &s;aid he <Q>are they, that creep into hou&s;es, and lead captive &s;illy women, who are ever learn|ing

"Is not the Lord among&s;t us?" Gifts blind the eyes of the wi&s;e. The gift of God was never purcha&s;ed with mo|ney.

<P>AS the waters run away when the flood-gates are up, &s;o doth the vi&s;itation of God's love pa&s;s away from thee, O Derby!

Thy women go with &s;tretched-forth necks and wanton eyes, &amp;c. which the true prophets of old cried again&s;t. Your a&s;&s;emblies are odious, an abomination to the Lord: pride is &s;et up and bowed down to, covetou&s;ne&s;s abounds, and he that doth wickedly is honoured. So deceit bears with deceit, yet they profe&s;s Chri&s;t in words. Oh! the deceit that is within thee! It even breaks my heart to &s;ee how God is di&s;honoured in thee, O Derby!</P>
</LETTER>
<P>After I had &s;een the vi&s;itation of God's love pa&s;s away from this place, I knew that my impri&s;onment here would, not continue long; but I &s;aw that when the Lord &s;hould bring me forth, it would be as the letting of a lion out of a den among&s;t the wild bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t. For all pro|fe&s;&s;ions &s;tood in a bea&s;tly &s;pirit and nature, pleading for &s;in, and for the body of &s;in and imperfection, as long as they lived. They raged, and ran again&s;t the life and &s;pirit which gave forth the &s;criptures, yet profe&s;&s;ed them in words, as will appear hereafter.</P>
<P>There was a great judgment upon the town, and the ma|gi&s;trates were unea&s;y about me; but could not agree what to do with me. One while they would have &s;ent me up to
<PB N="64" REF="037441_0141_100D8E7CDF069C98">the parliament; another while they would have bani&s;hed me to Ireland. At fir&s;t they called me a deceiver, a &s;edu|cer, and a bla&s;phemer. Afterwards, when God had brought his plagues upon them, they &s;tiled me an hone&s;t virtuous man. But their good report and bad report were nothing to me; for the one did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lift me up, nor the other ca&s;t me down: prai&s;ed be the Lord! At length they were made to turn me out of gaol, about the beginning of winter in the year 1651, after I had been a pri&s;oner in Derby almo&s;t a year; &s;ix months in the hou&s;e of correction, and the re&s;t of the time in the common gaol.</P>
<P>Being at liberty I went on, as before, in the work of the Lord. pa&s;&s;ing through the country into Leice&s;ter&s;hire, hav|ing meetings as I went; and the Lord's Spirit and power accompanied me. Afterwards I went near Burton upon Trent, where &s;ome were convinced; and to Bu&s;hel-Hou&s;e, where I had a meeting. I went into the country, where there were friendly people; yet an outrageous wicked pro|&s;e&s;&s;or had an intent to have done me a mi&s;chief, but the Lord prevented him: ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord!</P>
<P>As I was walking with &s;everal friends, I lifted up my head, and &s;aw three &s;teeple-hou&s;e &s;pires, and they &s;truck at my life. I a&s;ked them what place that was? They &s;aid, Lichfield. Immediately the word of the Lord came to me, that I mu&s;t go thither. Being come to the hou&s;e we were going to, I wi&s;h'd friends to walk into the hou&s;e, &s;aying nothing to them whither I was to go. As &s;oon as they were gone I &s;tept away, and went by my eye over hedge and ditch till I came within a mile of Lichfield; where, in a great field, &s;hepherds were keeping their &s;heep. Then was I commanded by the Lord to pull off my &s;hoes. I &s;tood &s;till, for it was winter; and the word of the Lord was like a fire in me. So I put off my &s;hoes, and left them with the &s;hepherds; and the poor &s;hepherds trembled, and were a&s;toni&s;hed. Then I walked on about a mile, and as &s;oon as I was got within the city, the word of the Lord came to me again, &s;aying; Cry, <Q>Wo to the bloody city of Lichfield!</Q> So I went up and down the &s;treets, cry|ing with a loud voice, WO TO THE BLOODY CITY OF LICHFIELD! It being market-day, I went into the mar|ket-place, and to and fro in the &s;everal parts of it, and made &s;tands, crying as before, WO TO THE BLOODY CITY OF LICHFIELD! And no one laid hands on me. As I went thus crying through the &s;treets, there &s;eemed to
<PB N="65" REF="037441_0142_100D8E7F5C26F860">me to be a channel of blood running down the &s;treets, and the market-place appeared like a pool of blood. When I had declared what was upon me, and felt my&s;elf clear, I went out of the town in peace; and returning to the &s;hep|herds gave them &s;ome money, and took my &s;hoes of them again. But the &s;ire of the Lord was &s;o in my feet, and all over me, that I did not matter to put on my &s;hoes again, and was at a &s;tand whether I &s;hould or no, till I felt freedom from the Lord &s;o to do: them, after I had wa&s;hed my feet, I put on my &s;hoes again. After this a deep con&s;ideration came upon me, for what rea&s;on I &s;hould be &s;ent to cry again&s;t that city, and call it THE BLOODY CITY! For though the parliament had the min&s;ter one while, and the king another, and much blood had been &s;hed in the town during the wars between them, yet that was no more than had befallen many other places. But afterwards I came to under&s;tand, that in the emperor Dio|cle&s;ian's time a thou&s;and Chri&s;tians were martyr'd in Lich|field. So I was to go, without my &s;hoes, through the channel of their blood, and into the pool of their blood in the market-place, that I might rai&s;e up the memorial of the blood of tho&s;e martyrs, which had been &s;hed above a thou|&s;and years before, and lay cold in their &s;treets. So the &s;en&s;e of this blood was upon me, and I obeyed the word of the Lord. Ancient records te&s;tify how many of the chri&s;tian Britons &s;uffered there. Much I could write of the &s;en&s;e I had of the blood of the martyrs, that hath been &s;hed in this nation for the name of Chri&s;t, both under the ten per&s;ecutions and &s;ince; but I leave it to the Lord, and to his book, out of which all &s;hall be judged; for his book is a mo&s;t certain record, and his Spirit a true recorder.</P>
<P>Then I pa&s;&s;ed through the countries, having meetings among&s;t friendly people in many places; but my relations were offended at me. After &s;ome time I returned into Nottingham&s;hire, to Mansfield, and into Derby&s;hire, vi&s;it|ing friends. Then pa&s;&s;ing into York&s;hire, I preached re|pentance through Donca&s;ter, and &s;everal other places; and came to Balby, where Richard Far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;worth and others were convinced. So travelling through &s;everal places, preaching repentance, and the word of life to the people, I came into the parts about Wakefield, where James Nayler lived; who, with Thomas Goodyear, came to me, and were both convinced, and received the truth. William Dew&s;bury al&s;o and his wife, with many more came to me, who were
<PB N="66" REF="037441_0143_100D8E81972F68D8">convinced, and received the truth. From thence I pa&s;&s;ed towards captain Pur&s;loe's by Selby, and vi&s;ited John Leek, who had been to &s;ee me in Derby pri&s;on, and was convin|ced. I had a hor&s;e, but was fain to leave him, not know|ing what to do with him; for I was moved to go to many great hou&s;es, to admoni&s;h and exhort the people to turn to the Lord. I was moved of the Lord to go to Beverly &s;teeple-hou&s;e, which was a place of high profe&s;&s;ion. Being very wet with rain, I went fir&s;t to an inn. As &s;oon as I came to the door, a young woman of the hou&s;e &s;aid, "What! is it you? Come in," as if &s;he had known me before; for the Lord's power bowed their hearts. So I re|fre&s;hed my&s;elf, and went to bed. In the morning, my cloaths' being &s;till wet, I got ready, and having paid for what I had, went up to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, where was a man preaching. When he had done, I was moved to &s;peak to him and to the people in the mighty power of God, and turned them to their teacher, Chri&s;t Je&s;us. The power of the Lord was &s;o &s;trong, that it &s;truck a mighty dread among&s;t the people. The mayor came and &s;poke a few words to me; but none had power to meddle with me. So I pa&s;&s;ed out of the town, and in the afternoon went to another &s;teeple-hou&s;e about two miles off. When the prie&s;t had done I was moved to &s;peak to him and to the people very largely, &s;hewing them the way of life and truth, and the ground of election and reprobation. The prie&s;t &s;aid, he was but a child, and could not di&s;pute with me. I told him I did not come to di&s;pute, but to hold forth the word of life and truth unto them, that they might all know the one &s;eed which the promi&s;e of God was to, both in the male and in the female. Here the people were very loving, and would have had me come again on a week|day, and preach among them: but I directed them to their teacher, Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and the next day went to Cran&s;ick, to captain Pur&s;loe's; who accompanied me to ju&s;tice Ho|tham's. Ju&s;tice Hotham was a pretty tender man, and had &s;ome experience of God's workings in his heart. After &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with him of the things of God, he took me into his clo&s;et; where &s;itting together, he told me he had known that principle the&s;e ten years, and was glad that the Lord did now &s;end his &s;ervants to publi&s;h it abroad to the people. After awhile a prie&s;t came to vi&s;it him, with whom I had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e concerning truth. His mouth was
<PB N="67" REF="037441_0144_100D8E83F08A1238">quickly &s;topt; for he was nothing but a notioni&s;t, and not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he talked of.</P>
<P>While I was there, a great woman of Beverly came to ju&s;tice Hotham about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s. In di&s;cour&s;e &s;he told him, <Q>The la&s;t &s;abbath-day, as &s;he called it, there was an angel or &s;pirit came into the church at Beverly, and &s;poke the wonderful things of God, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all that were there; and when it had done, it pa&s;&s;ed away, and they did not know whence it came nor whither it went; but it a&s;toni&s;hed all, prie&s;t, profe&s;&s;ors, and ma|gi&s;trates.</Q> This relation ju&s;tice Hotham gave me after|wards; and then I gave him an account that I had been that day at Beverly &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and had declared truth to the prie&s;t and people there.</P>
<P>In the country thereabouts were &s;ome noted prie&s;ts and doctors that ju&s;tice Hotham had acquaintance with. He would fain have them &s;peak with me, and offered to &s;end for them, under pretence of &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s he had with them; but I wi&s;h'd him not to do &s;o.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t-day was come, ju&s;tice Hotham walked out with me into the fields; and captain Pur&s;loe coming after us, ju&s;tice Hotham left us, and returned home; but captain Pur&s;loe went with me into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e. When the prie&s;t had done, I &s;poke to both prie&s;t and people; decla|red to them the word of life and truth, and directed them where they might find their teacher, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Some were convinced, received the truth, and &s;tand fa&s;t in it, and have a &s;ine meeting to this day.</P>
<P>In the afternoon I went to another &s;teeple-hou&s;e, about three miles off, where preached a great high prie&s;t, called a doctor, one of them whom ju&s;tice Hotham would have &s;ent for to have &s;poken with me. I went into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and &s;taid till the prie&s;t had done. The words which he took for his text were the&s;e: <Q>Ho, every one that thir&s;t|eth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat, yea come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</Q> Then was I moved of the Lord God to &s;ay to him, <Q>Come down, thou de|ceiver; do&s;t thou bid people come freely, and take of the water of life freely, and yet thou take&s;t three hundred pounds a year of them for preaching the &s;criptures to them? May&s;t thou not blu&s;h for &s;hame? Did the pro|phet I&s;aiah and Chri&s;t do &s;o, who &s;pake the words, and gave them forth freely?</Q> Did not Chri&s;t &s;ay to his mini&s;|ters,
<PB N="68" REF="037441_0145_100D8E86CD5C6900">whom he &s;ent to preach, <Q>Freely ye have received, freely give?</Q> The prie&s;t, like a man amazed, ha&s;ted away. After he had left his flock, I had as much time as I could de&s;ire to &s;peak to the people. I directed them from darkne&s;s to the light, and to the grace of God that would teach them, and bring them &s;alvation; to the Spirit of God in their inward parts, which would be a free teacher unto them.</P>
<P>Having cleared my&s;elf among&s;t that people, I returned to ju&s;tice Hotham's that night; who, when I came in, took me in his arms, and &s;aid, His hou&s;e was my hou&s;e, for he was exceeding glad at the work of the Lord, and that his power was revealed. Then he told me why he went not with me to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e in the morning, and what rea|&s;onings he had in him&s;elf about it; for he thought, if he had gone with me to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, the officers would have put me to him; and then he &s;hould not have known what to have done: but he was glad, he &s;aid, when captain Pur&s;loe came up to go with me; yet neither of them was dre&s;&s;ed, nor had their bands about their necks. It was a &s;trange thing then to &s;ee a man come into a &s;teeple-hou&s;e without a band; yet captain Pur&s;loe went in with me with|out his band, the Lord's power and truth had &s;o affected him that he minded it not.</P>
<P>From hence I pa&s;&s;ed on, and came at night to an inn where was a company of rude people. I bid the woman of the hou&s;e, if &s;he had any meat, to bring me &s;ome; but be|cau&s;e I &s;aid Thee and Thou to her, &s;he looked &s;trangely on me. I a&s;ked her if &s;he had any milk? She &s;aid, No. I was &s;en&s;ible &s;he &s;pake fal&s;ely; and, being willing to try her fur|ther, I a&s;ked her, If &s;he had any cream? She denied that &s;he had any. There &s;tood a churn in the room, and a little boy playing about, put his hands into it, and pulled it down, and threw all the cream on the floor before my eyes. Thus was the woman manife&s;ted to be a liar. She was amazed, ble&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, took up the child, and whipped it &s;orely: but I reproved her for her lying and deceit. After the Lord had thus di&s;covered her deceit and perver&s;ene&s;s, I walked out of the hou&s;e, and went away till I came to a &s;tack of hay, and lay in the hay-&s;tack that night, in rain and &s;now; it being but three days before the time called Chri&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as.</P>
<P>The next day I came into York, where were &s;everal very tender people. Upon the fir&s;t-day following. I was com|manded of the Lord to go and &s;peak to prie&s;t Bowles and
<PB N="69" REF="037441_0146_100D8E8941FF9CA8">his hearers in their great cathedral. Accordingly I went: When the prie&s;t had done, I told them I had &s;omething from the Lord God to &s;peak to the prie&s;t and people. <Q>Then &s;ay on quickly.</Q> &s;aid a profe&s;&s;or, for it was fro&s;t and &s;now, and very cold weather. Then I told them, This was the word of the Lord God unto them, that they lived in words, but God Almighty looked for fruits among&s;t them. As &s;oon as the words were out of my mouth, they hurried me out, and threw me down the &s;teps. But I got up again without hurt, and went to my lodging, and &s;eve|ral were convinced there. For what aro&s;e from the weight and oppre&s;&s;ion that was upon the Spirit of God in me, would open people, &s;trike them, and make them con&s;e&s;s that the groans which brake forth through me did reach them; for my life was burthened with their profe&s;&s;ion with|out po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and words without fruit.</P>
<P>After I had done my pre&s;ent &s;ervice in York, and &s;everal were convinced there, received the truth of God, and were turned to his teaching; I looked towards Cleaveland, and &s;aw there was a people that had ta&s;ted of the power of God. I &s;aw there was a &s;eed in that country, and that God had an humble people there. Pa&s;&s;ing onwards that night, a papi&s;t overtook me, and talked to me of his religion, and of their meetings; and I let him &s;peak all that was in his mind. That night I &s;taid at an alehou&s;e. Next morning I was moved to &s;peak the word of the Lord to this papi&s;t. So I went to his hou&s;e, and declared again&s;t all their &s;uper|&s;titious ways; and told him, that God was come to teach his people him&s;elf. This put him into &s;uch a rage, that he could not endure to &s;tay in his own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Next day I came to Burraby, where a prie&s;t and &s;everal friendly people were met together. Many of the people were convinced, and have continued faithful ever &s;ince. There is a great meeting of friends in that town. The prie&s;t al&s;o was forced to confe&s;s to truth, though he came not in|to it.</P>
<P>The day following I went to Cleaveland, among&s;t tho&s;e people that had ta&s;ted of the power of God. They had formerly had great meetings, but were then &s;hattered to pie|ces, and the heads of them turned Ranters. I told them, That after they had &s;uch meetings, they did not wait upon God to &s;eel his power to gather their minds inward, that they might &s;eel his pre&s;ence and power among&s;t them in their meetings, to &s;it down therein and wait upon him: for
<PB N="70" REF="037441_0147_100D8E8ADB815DD8">they had &s;poken them&s;elves dry; they had &s;pent their por|tions, and not living in that which they &s;pake of, they were now become dry. They had &s;ome kind of meetings &s;till; but they took tobacco, and drank ale in their meetings, and were grown light and loo&s;e. But my me&s;&s;age unto them from the Lord was, That they &s;hould all come together again, and wait to &s;eel the Lord's power and Spirit in them&s;elves; to gather them to Chri&s;t, that they might be taught of him, who &s;ays, "Learn of me." For when they had declared that which the Lord had opened to them, then the people were to receive it; and both the &s;peakers and the hearers were to live in that them&s;elves. But when the&s;e had no more to declare, but went to &s;eek forms without life, that made them&s;elves dry and barren, and the people al&s;o; and from thence came all their lo&s;s: for the Lord renews his mercies and his &s;trength to them that wait upon him. The heads of them came to nothing: but mo&s;t of the people were convinced, and received God's everla&s;ting truth, and continue a meeting to this day, &s;itting under the teaching of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t their Saviour.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t day of the next week, the word of the Lord came to me to go to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e; which I did. When the prie&s;t had done, I &s;pake the truth to him and the people, and directed them to their teacher within. Chri&s;t Je&s;us, their free teacher who had bought them. The prie&s;t came to me, and I had a little di&s;cour&s;e with him; but he was &s;oon &s;topped, and &s;ilent. Then, being clear of the place, I pa&s;&s;ed away, having had &s;everal meetings among&s;t tho&s;e people.</P>
<P>Though the &s;now was very deep, I kept travelling; and came to a market-town, where I met with many profe&s;&s;ors, with whom I had much rea&s;oning. I a&s;ked them many que&s;tions, which they were not able to an&s;wer; &s;aying, They never had &s;uch deep que&s;tions put to them in their lives.</P>
<P>From them I went to Stath, where I met with many pro|fe&s;&s;ors, and &s;ome Ranters. I had large meetings among&s;t them, and a great convincement there was. Many received the truth: among&s;t whom one was a man of an hundred years of age; another was a chief con&s;table; a third was a prie&s;t, who&s;e name was Philip Scafe. Him the Lord, by his free Spirit, did afterwards make a free mini&s;ter of his free go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The prie&s;t of this town was a lo&s;ty one, who much op|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="71" REF="037441_0148_100D8E8D14637B80">the people for his tythes. If they went a fi&s;hing many leagues off, he would exact the tythe-money of what they made of their fi&s;h, though they catched them at a great di&s;tance, and carried them as far as Yarmouth to &s;ell. I was moved to go to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e there, to declare the truth, and lay open the prie&s;t. When I had &s;poken to him, and laid his oppre&s;&s;ing of the people upon him, he fled away. The chief of the pari&s;h were very light and vain. After I had &s;poken the word of life to them, I turned away from them, becau&s;e they did not receive it; and left them. But the word of the Lord, which I had declared among&s;t them, &s;tuck with &s;ome, &s;o that at night &s;ome of the heads of the pari&s;h came to me. Mo&s;t of them were convinced and &s;atisfied, and confe&s;&s;ed to the truth. Thus the truth began to &s;pread in that country, and great meetings we had; at which the prie&s;t began to rage, and the Ranters to be &s;tirred; who &s;ent me word they would have a di&s;pute with me; both the oppre&s;&s;ing prie&s;t and the leader of the Ranters. A day was fixed, and the Ranter came with his company. Another prie&s;t, a Scotchman, came; but not the oppre&s;&s;ing prie&s;t of Stath. Philip Scafe was with me; and a great number of people met. When we were &s;ettled, T. Bu&s;hel, the Ranter, told me. He had had a vi&s;ion of me, that I was &s;itting in a great chair, and that he was to come and put off his hat, and bow down to the ground before me; which he did. I told him, It was his own fi|gure; and &s;aid, "Repent, thou bea&s;t." He &s;aid it was jea|lou&s;y in me to &s;ay &s;o. I a&s;ked him the ground of jealou&s;y, and how it came to be bred in man? And the nature of a bea&s;t, what made it, and how it was bred in man? For I &s;aw him directly in that nature of the bea&s;t; and there|fore I queried how that nature came to be bred in him? I told him. He &s;hould give me an account of things done in the body, before we came to di&s;cour&s;e of things done out of the body. So I &s;topt his mouth, and his fellow Rant|ers were &s;ilenced: for he was the head of them. Then I called for the oppre&s;&s;ing prie&s;t; but only the Scotch prie&s;t came, who&s;e mouth was &s;oon &s;topt, with a very few words, he being out of the life of what he profe&s;&s;ed. Then I had good opportunity with the people. I laid open the Ranters, ranking them with the old Ranters in Sodom. The prie&s;ts I mani&s;elted to be of the &s;ame &s;tamp with their fellow hirelings, the fal&s;e prophets of old, and the prie&s;ts that then bore rule over the people by their means, &s;eeking their
<PB N="72" REF="037441_0149_100D8E8EB179C580">gain from their quarter, divining for money, and teaching for filthy lucre. I brought all the prophets, Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles, over the heads of the prie&s;ts, &s;hewing how the prophets, Chri&s;t, and the apo&s;tles, had long &s;ince di&s;cover|ed them by their marks and fruits. I directed the people to the inward teacher, Chri&s;t Je&s;us their Saviour; and preach|ed up Chri&s;t in the hearts of his people, when all the&s;e mountains were laid low. The people were all quiet, and the gain&s;ayers mouths were &s;topped; for though they broil|ed inwardly, the divine power &s;o bound them down, that they could not break out.</P>
<P>After the meeting, this Scotti&s;h prie&s;t de&s;ired me to walk with him atop of the cliffs. Whereupon I called a bro|ther-in-law of his, who was in &s;ome mea&s;ure convinced, and de&s;ired him to go with me, telling him, I was willing to have &s;omebody by to hear what we &s;aid; le&s;t the prie&s;t, when I was gone, &s;hould report any thing of me which I did not &s;ay. We went together, the prie&s;t a&s;king me many things concerning the light, and concerning the &s;oul; all which I an&s;wered him fully. When he had done que&s;tion|ing, we parted; and he went his way; and meeting with Philip Scafe, he brake his cane again&s;t the ground in mad|ne&s;s, and &s;aid, If ever he met with me again, he would have my life, or I &s;hould have his; adding, that he would give his head, if I was not knocked down within a month. By this, friends &s;u&s;pected his intent was, in de&s;iring me to walk with him alone, either to have thru&s;t me down from the cliff, or to have done me &s;ome other mi&s;chief; and being fru&s;trated, it made him rage. But I neither regarded his prophecies, nor his threats; for I feared God Almighty. After &s;ome years, this very Scotch prie&s;t and his wife came to be convinced of the truth; and about twelve years after I was at their hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Another prie&s;t came to a meeting where I was; one in repute above all the prie&s;ts in the country. As I was de|claring, that the go&s;pel was the power of God, and how it brought life and immortality to light in men, and was turn|ing people from darkne&s;s to light; this high-flown prie&s;t &s;aid, The go&s;pel was mortal. I told him, The true mi|ni&s;ter &s;aid, The go&s;pel was the power of God; and would he make the power of God mortal? Upon that, the other prie&s;t Philip Scafe, that was convinced, and had felt the immortal power of God in him&s;elf, took him up and re|proved him; &s;o a great di&s;pute aro&s;e between them: the
<PB N="73" REF="037441_0150_100D8E916FF93060">convinced prie&s;t holding that the go&s;pel was immortal, and the other holding it was mortal. But the Lord's power was too hard for this oppo&s;er, and &s;topped his mouth; and many were convinced, &s;eeing the darkne&s;s of the oppo&s;ing prie&s;t, and the light that was in the convinced prie&s;t.</P>
<P>Another prie&s;t &s;ent to have a di&s;pute with me, and friends went with me to the hou&s;e where he was; but when he un|der&s;tood we were come, he &s;lipt out of the hou&s;e, and hid him&s;elf under an hedge. The people went and found him, but could not get him to come to us. Then I went to a &s;teeple-hou&s;e hard by, where the prie&s;t and people were in a great rage: this prie&s;t had threatened friends what he would do: but when I came, he &s;led: for the Lord's pow|er came over him and them. Yea, the Lord's everla&s;ting power was over the world, and reached to the hearts of people, and made both prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors tremble. It &s;hook the earthly and airy &s;pirit, in which they held their profe&s;&s;ion of religion and wor&s;hip; &s;o that it was a dread|ful thing to them, when it was told them, "The man in leathern breeches is come." At the hearing thereof the prie&s;ts in many places got out of the way; they were &s;o &s;truck with the dread of the eternal power of God; and fear &s;urpri&s;ed the hypocrites.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed to Whitby and Scarborough, where we had &s;ome &s;ervice for the Lord: large meetings are &s;ettled there &s;ince. From thence I pa&s;&s;ed over the Woulds to Malton, where we had great meetings, as we had al&s;o at the towns thereabouts. At one town a prie&s;t &s;ent me a challenge to di&s;pute with me; but when I came he would not come forth. I had a good opportunity with the people, and the Lord's power laid hold upon them. One, who had been a wild drunken man, was &s;o reached, that he came to me as lowly as a lamb; though he and his companions had before &s;ent for drink to make the people rude, on purpo&s;e that they might abu&s;e us. When I found the prie&s;t would not come forth, I was moved to go to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and he was confounded; the Lord's power coming over all.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t-day following, came one of the highe&s;t indepen|dent profe&s;&s;ors, a woman, who had let in &s;uch a prejudice again&s;t me, that &s;he &s;aid, before the came, She could wil|lingly have gone to &s;ee me hanged. But coming, the was convinced, and remains a friend.</P>
<P>I turned to Malton again, and very great meetings there
<PB N="74" REF="037441_0151_100D8E93A26EED18">were; to which &s;everal more would have come, but dur&s;t not for fear of their relations; for it was thought a &s;trange thing then to preach in hou&s;es, and not go to the church, as they called it; I was therefore much de&s;ired to go and &s;peak in the &s;teeple-hou&s;es. One of the prie&s;ts wrote to me, and invited me to preach in his &s;teeple-hou&s;e, calling me his brother: another prie&s;t, a noted man, kept a lec|ture there. The Lord &s;hewed me, while I was in Derby pri&s;on, that I &s;hould &s;peak in &s;teeple-hou&s;es, to gather peo|ple from thence; and a concern &s;ometimes came upon my mind about the pulpits that the prie&s;ts lolled in. For the &s;teeple-hou&s;es and pulpits were offen&s;ive to my mind, be|cau&s;e both prie&s;ts and people called them the hou&s;e of God, and idolized them; reckoning that God dwelt in the outward hou&s;e. Whereas they &s;hould have looked for God and Chri&s;t to dwell in their hearts, and their bodies to be made the temples of God; for the apo&s;tle &s;aid, <Q>God dwelleth not in temples made with hands:</Q> but by rea|&s;on of the people's idolizing tho&s;e places, it was counted an heinous thing to declare again&s;t them. When I came into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, there were not above eleven hearers, and the prie&s;t was preaching to them. But after it was known in the town that I was there, it was &s;oon filled with people. When the prie&s;t had done, he &s;ent the other prie&s;t who had invited me thither, to bring me into the pul|pit; but I &s;ent him word, that I needed not go into the pulpit. He &s;ent to me again, de&s;iring me to go up into it; for, he &s;aid, it was a better place, and there I might be &s;een of the people. I &s;ent him word again, I could be &s;een and heard well enough where I was; and that I came not there to hold up &s;uch places, nor their main|tenance and trade. Upon this they began to be angry, and &s;aid, <Q>The&s;e fal&s;e prophets were to come in the la&s;t times.</Q> Their &s;aying &s;o grieved many of the people, and &s;ome began to murmur at it. Whereupon I de&s;ired all to be quiet; and, &s;tepping upon an high &s;eat, declared to them the marks of the fal&s;e prophets, &s;hewing that they were already come; and &s;et the true prophets, Chri&s;t, and his apo&s;tles over them; and manife&s;ted the&s;e to be out of the &s;teps of the true prophets, of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. I directed the people to their inward teacher, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who would turn them from darkne&s;s to light. And having opened divers &s;criptures to them, I directed them to the Spirit of God in them&s;elves, by which they might come to
<PB N="75" REF="037441_0152_100D8E95F34CD000">him, and by which they might al&s;o come to know who the fal&s;e prophets were. So having had a large opportunity among them, I departed in peace.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, I came to Pickering, where in the &s;tee|ple-hou&s;e the ju&s;tices held their &s;e&s;&s;ions, ju&s;tice Robin&s;on being chairman. I had a meeting in the &s;chool-hou&s;e at the &s;ame time; and abundance of prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors came to it, a&s;king que&s;tions, which were an&s;wered to their &s;atis|faction. It being &s;e&s;&s;ions-time, four chief con&s;tables and many other people were convinced that day; and word was carried to ju&s;tice. Robin&s;on that his prie&s;t was overthrown and convinced; whom he had a love to, more than to all the prie&s;ts be&s;ides. After the meeting, we went to an inn, Ju&s;tice Robin&s;on's prie&s;t was very lowly and loving, and would have paid for my dinner; but I would by no means &s;uffer it. Then he offered me his &s;teeple-hou&s;e to preach in; but I refu&s;ed it, and told him and the people, that I came to bring them off from &s;uch things to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The next morning I went with the four chief con&s;tables and &s;ome others, to vi&s;it ju&s;tice Robin&s;on, who met me at his chamber-door. I told him, I could not honour him with man's honour. He &s;aid he did not look for it. So I went into his chamber, and opened to him the &s;tate of the fal&s;e prophets, and of the true prophets; and &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the true prophets, Chri&s;t, and the apo&s;tles, over the other; and di|rected his mind to Chri&s;t his teacher. I opened to him the parables, and how election and reprobation &s;tood; as that reprobation &s;tood in the fir&s;t birth, and election in the &s;e|cond birth. I &s;hewed al&s;o what the promi&s;e of God was to, and what the judgment of God was again&s;t. He confe&s;&s;ed to it all, and was &s;o opened with the truth, that when an|other ju&s;tice made &s;ome little oppo&s;ition, he informed him. At our parting, he &s;aid, It was very well that I did exer|ci&s;e that gift which God had given me. He took the chief con&s;tables a&s;ide, and would have given them &s;ome money for me, &s;aying. He would not have me be at any charge in their country; but they told him, they them&s;elves could not get me to take any money; and &s;o accepting his kind|ne&s;s, I refu&s;ed his money.</P>
<P>From thence I pa&s;&s;ed into the country, and the prie&s;t that called me brother (in who&s;e &s;chool-hou&s;e I had the meeting at Pickering) went along with me. When we came into a town to bait, the bells rang. I a&s;ked what they rang for? They &s;aid, For me to preach in the &s;teeple-hou&s;e.
<PB N="76" REF="037441_0153_100D8E98654E8D68">After &s;ome time I felt drawings that way: and as I walked to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, I &s;aw the people gathered together in the yard. The old prie&s;t would have had me gone into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e. I &s;aid, It was no matter. But it was &s;ome|thing &s;trange to the people, that I would not go into that which they called the hou&s;e of God. I &s;tood up in the &s;teeple-hou&s;e yard, and declared to the people, That I came not to hold up their idol-temples, nor their prie&s;ts, nor their tythes, nor their augmentations, nor their prie&s;ts-wa|ges, nor their Jewi&s;h and heatheni&s;h ceremonies and tradi|tions (for I denied all the&s;e) and told them, that piece of ground was no more holy than another piece of ground. I &s;hewed them, that the apo&s;tles going into the Jews &s;yna|gogues and temples, which God had commanded, was to bring people off from that temple, and tho&s;e &s;ynagogues, and from the offerings, tythes, and covetous prie&s;ts of that time; that &s;uch as came to be convinced of the truth, con|verted to it, and believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom the apo&s;|tles preached, met together in dwelling-hou&s;es; and that all who preach Chri&s;t, the Word of life, ought to preach freely, as the apo&s;tles did, and as he commanded. So I was &s;ent of the Lord God of heaven and earth to preach freely, and to bring people off from the&s;e outward temples made with hands, which God dwelleth not in; that they might know their bodies to become the temples of God and of Chri&s;t; and to draw people off from all their &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies, Jewi&s;h and heatheni&s;h cu&s;toms, traditions, and doctrines of men; and from all the world's hireling teach|ers, that take tythes and great wages, preaching for hire, and divining for money, whom God and Chri&s;t never &s;ent, as them&s;elves confe&s;s, when they &s;ay, They never heard God's nor Chri&s;t's voice. I exhorted the people to come off from all the&s;e things, directing them to the Spirit and grace of God in them&s;elves, and to the light of Je&s;us in their own hearts; that they might come to know Chri&s;t, their free teacher, to bring them &s;alvation, and to open the &s;crip|tures to them. Thus the Lord gave me a good opportunity to open things largely unto them. All was quiet, and many were convinced: ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed to another town, where was another great meet|ing, the old prie&s;t being with me; and there came profe&s;|&s;ors of &s;everal &s;orts to it. I &s;ate on a hay-&s;tack, and &s;poke nothing for &s;ome hours; for I was to fami&s;h them from words. The profe&s;&s;ors would ever and anon be &s;peaking to
<PB N="77" REF="037441_0154_100D8E9A74284B80">the old prie&s;t, and a&s;king him when I would begin, and when I would &s;peak? He bade them wait; and told them, that the people waited upon Chri&s;t a long while before he &s;poke. At la&s;t I was moved of the Lord to &s;peak; and they were &s;truck by the Lord's power. The word of life reached to them, and there was a general convincement among&s;t them.</P>
<P>From hence I pa&s;&s;ed on, the old prie&s;t being &s;till with me, and &s;everal others. As we went along, &s;ome people called to him and &s;aid, <Q>Mr. Boyes, we owe you &s;ome money for tythes, pray come and take it.</Q> But he threw up his hands, and &s;aid, <Q>He had enough, he would have none of it; they might keep it:</Q> and, <Q>he prai&s;ed the Lord he had enough.</Q></P>
<P>At length we came to his &s;teeple-hou&s;e in the Moors, and he went before me, and held open the pulpit door; but I told him I would not go into it. This &s;teeple-hou&s;e was very much painted. I told him and the people, the painted bea&s;t had a painted hou&s;e. I opened to them the ri&s;e of tho&s;e hou&s;es; and their &s;uper&s;titious ways; &s;hewing them, that as the end of the apo&s;tles going into the temple and &s;ynagogues, which God had commanded, was not to hold them up, but to bring them to Chri&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance; &s;o the end of my coming there was not to hold up the&s;e temples, prie&s;ts, and tythes, which God had never com|manded, but to bring them from all the&s;e things to Chri&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance. I &s;hewed them the true wor&s;hip which Chri&s;t had &s;et up, and di&s;tingui&s;hed Chri&s;t the true way from all the fal&s;e ways, opening the parables to them, and turning them from darkne&s;s to the true light, that by it they might &s;ee them&s;elves, their &s;ins, and Chri&s;t their Saviour; that believing in him they might be &s;aved from their &s;ins.</P>
<P>After this we went to one Birdet's, where I had a great meeting; and this old prie&s;t accompanied me &s;till, leaving his &s;teeple-hou&s;e. He had been looked upon as a famous prie&s;t, above common-prayermen, pre&s;byters, and inde|pendents too. Before he was convinced he went &s;ometimes into their &s;teeple-hou&s;es, and preached; for he had been a zealous man in his way: and when they complained of him to ju&s;tice Hotham, he bid them di&s;train his hor&s;e for travel|ling on the Lord's day, as he called it; but Hotham did that to put them off, for he knew the prie&s;t u&s;ed no hor&s;e, but travelled on foot.</P>
<P>Now I came towards Crant&s;ick to captain Pur&s;loe's and
<PB N="78" REF="037441_0155_100D8E9C8EA06E38">ju&s;tice Hotham's, who received me kindly, being glad the Lord's power had &s;o appeared, that truth was &s;pread and &s;o many had received it, and that ju&s;tice Robin&s;on was &s;o civil. Ju&s;tice Hotham &s;aid, If God had not rai&s;ed up this principle of light and life, which I preached, the nation had been over-run with Ranteri&s;m, and all the ju&s;tices in the nation could not have &s;topped it with all their laws; be|cau&s;e, &s;aid he, they would have &s;aid as we &s;aid, and done as we commanded, and yet have kept their own principle &s;till. But this principle of truth overthrows their principle in the root and ground thereof; therefore he was glad the Lord had rai&s;ed up this principle of life and truth.</P>
<P>From thence I travelled into Holderne&s;s, and came to a ju&s;tice's hou&s;e, who&s;e name was Pear&s;on, where was a very tender woman, that believed in the truth, and was &s;o af|fected therewith, that &s;he &s;aid, <Q>She could have left all and have followed me.</Q></P>
<P>Thence I went to Oram, to George Harti&s;e's; where many of that town were convinced. On the fir&s;t-day I was moved to go into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, where the prie&s;t had got another to help him: and many profe&s;&s;ors and con|tenders were got together. But the Lord's power was over all; the prie&s;ts fled away, and a great deal of good &s;ervice I had for the Lord among&s;t the people. Some of tho&s;e great profe&s;&s;ors were convinced, and became hone&s;t faithful friends; being men of account in that place.</P>
<P>The next day, friends and friendly people having left me, I travelled alone, declaring the day of the Lord among&s;t people in the towns where I came, and warning them to repent. I came towards night into a town called Patring|ton. As I walked along the town, I warned both prie&s;ts and people (for the prie&s;t was in the &s;treet) to repent and turn to the Lord. It grew dark before I came to the end of the town, and a multitude of people gathered about me, to whom I declared the word of life.</P>
<P>When I had cleared my&s;elf I went to an inn, and de|&s;ired them to let me have a lodging; but they would not. I de&s;ired a little meat or milk, and I would pay for it; but they refu&s;ed. So I walked out of the town, and a company of fellows followed, and a&s;ked me, What news? I bid them repent, and fear the Lord. After I was gone a pretty way, I came to another hou&s;e, and de&s;ired the people to let me have a little meat, drink, and lodging for my money; but they denied me. I went to another hou&s;e, and de&s;ired the
<PB N="79" REF="037441_0156_100D8E9EC14706C0">&s;ame; but they refu&s;ed me al&s;o. By this time it was grown &s;o dark that I could not &s;ee the highway; but I di&s;cerned a ditch, and got a little water and refre&s;hed my&s;elf. Then I got over the ditch; and, being weary with travelling, I &s;ate down among&s;t the furze bu&s;hes till it was day. About break of day I got up, and pa&s;&s;ed on the fields. A man came after me with a great pike&s;taff, and went along with me to a town; and he rai&s;ed the town upon me, with the con&s;table and chief con&s;table, before the &s;un was up. I declared God's everla&s;ting truth among&s;t them, warning them of the day of the Lord, that was coming upon all &s;in and wickedne&s;s; and exhorted them to repent. But they &s;eized me, and had me back to Patrington, about three miles, guarding me with watch-bills, pikes, &s;taves, and hal|berds. When I was come to Patrington, all the town was in an uproar, and the prie&s;t and con&s;tables were con&s;ulting together; &s;o I had another opportunity to declare the word of life among&s;t them, and warn them to repent. At la&s;t a profe&s;&s;or, a tender man, called me into his hou&s;e, and there I took a little milk and bread, having not eaten for &s;ome days before. Then they guarded me about nine miles to a ju&s;tice. When I was come near his hou&s;e, a man came riding after us, and a&s;ked me, whether I was the man that was apprehended? I a&s;ked him, wherefore he a&s;ked? He &s;aid, for no hurt. I told him, I was: &s;o he rode away to the ju&s;tice before us. The men that guarded me &s;aid, It was well if the ju&s;tice was not drunk before we got to him; for he u&s;ed to get drunk early. When I was brought in before him, becau&s;e I did not put off my hat, and &s;aid Thou to him, he a&s;ked the man that rode thither before me, whe|ther I was not mazed or fond? The man told him, no; it was my principle. I warned him to repent, and come to the light, which Chri&s;t had enlightened him withal; that by it he might &s;ee all his evil words and actions, and turn to Chri&s;t Je&s;us whil&s;t he had time; and that whil&s;t he had time he &s;hould prize it. Ay, ay, &s;aid he, the light that is &s;poken of in the third of John. I de&s;ired he would mind it, and obey it. As I admoni&s;hed him, I laid my hand upon him, and he was brought down by the power of the Lord; and all the watchmen &s;tood amazed. Then he took me into a little parlour with the other man, and de&s;ired to &s;ee what I had in my pockets of letters or intelligence. I plucked out my linen, and &s;hewed him I had no letters. He &s;aid, he is not a vagrant by his linen: then he &s;et me at
<PB N="80" REF="037441_0157_100D8EA0EC481328">liberty. I went back to Patrington with the man that had rode before me to the ju&s;tice: for he lived at Patrington. When I came there, he would have had me had a meeting at the Cro&s;s; but I &s;aid, it was no matter, his hou&s;e would &s;erve. He de&s;ired me to go to bed, or lie down upon a bed; which he did, that they might &s;ay they had &s;een me in or upon a bed, for they had got a report that I would not lie on any bed, becau&s;e I laid many times without doors. When fir&s;t-day was come I went to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and declared the truth to the prie&s;t and people; and the people did not mole&s;t me, for the power of God was come over them. Pre&s;ently after I had a great meeting at the man's hou&s;e where I lay, and many were convinced of the Lord's everla&s;ting truth, who &s;tand faithful witne&s;&s;es of it to this day; and they were exceedingly grieved that they did not receive me, nor give me lodging, when I was there before.</P>
<P>From hence I travelled through the country to the fur|the&s;t part thereof, warning people in towns and villages to repent, and directing them to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, their teacher.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t-day I came to colonel Overton's, and had a great meeting of the prime of the people of that country, where many things were opened out of the &s;criptures, which they had never heard before. Many were convinced, and re|ceived the word of life, and were &s;ettled in the truth of God.</P>
<P>I returned to Patrington again, and vi&s;ited tho&s;e friends that were convinced there; by whom I under&s;tood, that taylor and &s;ome wild blades in that town had occa&s;ioned my being carried before the ju&s;tice. The taylor came to a&s;k me forgivene&s;s, fearing I would complain of him. The con&s;tables al&s;o were afraid, le&s;t I &s;hould trouble them. But I forgave them all, and warned them to turn to the Lord, and to amend their lives. That which made them the more afraid was this: when I was in the &s;teeple-hou&s;e at Oram not long before, a profe&s;&s;or gave me a pu&s;h on the brea&s;t in the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and bid me get out of the church. Alas! poor man! &s;aid I, do&s;t thou call the &s;teeple-hou&s;e the church? The church is the people whom God hath purcha&s;ed with his blood, and not the hou&s;e. It happen|ed that ju&s;tice Hotham came to hear of this man's abu&s;e, &s;ent his warrant for him, and bound him over to the &s;e&s;|&s;ions; &s;o affected was he with the truth, and &s;o zealous to keep the peace: and indeed this ju&s;tice had a&s;ked me be|fore,
<PB N="81" REF="037441_0158_100D8EA3C9210170">whether any had meddled with me or abu&s;ed me? But I was not to tell him any thing of that kind; but was to forgive all.</P>
<P>From Patrington I went to &s;everal great men's hou&s;es, warning them to repent. Some received me lovingly, and &s;ome &s;lighted me. At night I came to another town, where I de&s;ired lodging and meat, and I would pay for it; but they would not lodge me, except I would go to the con&s;ta|ble, which was the cu&s;tom (they &s;aid) of all lodgers at inns, if &s;trangers. I told them, I would not go; for that cu&s;tom was for &s;u&s;picious per&s;ons, I was an innocent man. After I had warned them to repent, declared to them the day of their vi&s;itation, and directed them to the light of Chri&s;t and the &s;pirit of God, that they might come to know &s;alvation, I pa&s;&s;ed away; and the people were &s;omewhat tendered and troubled afterwards. When it grew dark, I &s;pied a hay-&s;tack, and went and &s;ate under it till morning.</P>
<P>The next day I pa&s;&s;ed into Hull, admoni&s;hing and warn|ing people, as I went, to turn to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that they might receive &s;alvation. That night I got a lodging; but was very &s;ore with travelling on foot &s;o far.</P>
<P>Afterwards I came to Balby, vi&s;ited friends up and down in tho&s;e parts, and then pa&s;&s;ed into the edge of Nottingham|&s;hire, vi&s;iting friends there: and &s;o into Lincoln&s;hire, and vi&s;ited friends there. On fir&s;t-day I went to a &s;teeple-hou&s;e on this &s;ide of Trent, and in the afternoon to another on the other &s;ide of Trent, declaring the word of life to the people, and directing them to their teacher Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who died for them, that they might hear him and receive &s;alvation by him. Then I went further into the country, and had &s;eve|ral meetings. To one meeting came a great man, a prie&s;t, and many profe&s;&s;ors; but the Lord's power came over them all, and they went their way peaceably. There came a man to that meeting, who had been at one before, and rai&s;ed a fal&s;e accu&s;ation again&s;t me, and made a noi&s;e up and down the country, reporting, that I &s;aid I was Chri&s;t; which was utterly fal&s;e. When I came to Gain&s;borough, where a friend had been declaring truth in the market, the town and market-people were all in an uproar. I went into a friendly man's hou&s;e, and the people ru&s;hed in after me; &s;o that the hou&s;e was filled with profe&s;&s;ors, di&s;puters, and rude people. This fal&s;e accu&s;er came in, and charged me openly before the people, <Q>That I &s;aid I was Chri&s;t, and he had got witne&s;&s;es to prove it.</Q> Which put the people into &s;uch a rage, that they had much to do
<PB N="82" REF="037441_0159_100D8EA55D4535B8">to keep their hands off me. I was moved of the Lord to &s;tand up upon the table, in the eternal power of God, and tell the people, <Q>That Chri&s;t was in them, except they were reprobates; and that it was Chri&s;t, the eternal power of God, that &s;poke in me at that time unto them; NOT that I was CHRIST.</Q> And the people were greatly &s;atis|fied, except him&s;elf, a profe&s;&s;or, and his own fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es. I called the accu&s;er Judas, and was moved to tell him that Judas's end &s;hould be his; that was the word of the Lord and of Chri&s;t through me to him. The Lord's power came over all, and quieted the minds of the people, and they de|parted in peace. But this Judas &s;hortly after hanged him|&s;elf, and a &s;take was driven into his grave. Afterwards the wicked prie&s;ts rai&s;ed a &s;candal upon us, and reported that a Quaker had hanged him&s;elf in Lincoln&s;hire, and had a &s;take driven through him. This fal&s;ehood they printed to the nation, adding &s;in to &s;in; which the truth and we were clear of: for he was no more a Quaker than the prie&s;t that printed it, but one of their own people. Notwith|&s;tanding this wicked &s;lander by which the adver&s;ary de&s;ign|ed to defame us, and turn people's minds again&s;t the truth we held forth, many in Lincoln&s;hire received the go&s;pel, being convinced of the Lord's everla&s;ting truth, and &s;ate down therein under his heavenly teaching.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed in the Lord's power into York&s;hire, came to Warn&s;worth, and went to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e in the forenoon; but they &s;hut the door again&s;t me: yet after awhile they let in Thomas Aldam, and then &s;hut it again; and the prie&s;t fell upon him, a&s;king him que&s;tions. At la&s;t they opened the door, and I went in. As &s;oon as I was come in the prie&s;t's &s;ight he left preaching, though I &s;aid nothing to him; and a&s;ked me, "What have you to &s;ay?" and pre&s;ently cried out. <Q>Come, come, I will prove them fal&s;e prophets in Matthew.</Q> But he was &s;o confounded, he could not &s;ind the chapter. Then he &s;ell on me, a&s;king me many que&s;tions; and I &s;tood &s;till all this while, not &s;aying any thing among&s;t them. At la&s;t I &s;aid, <Q>Seeing here are &s;o many que&s;tions a&s;ked, I may an&s;wer them.</Q> But as &s;oon as I began to &s;peak, the people violently ru&s;hed upon me, thru&s;t me out of the &s;teeple-hou&s;e again, and locked the door again&s;t me. As &s;oon as they had done their &s;er|vice, and were come forth, the people ran upon me, knock|ed me &s;orely with their &s;taves, threw clods and &s;tones at me, and abu&s;ed me much: the prie&s;t al&s;o, being in a great rage,
<PB N="83" REF="037441_0160_100D8EA7695FC430">laid violent hands on me him&s;elf. I warned them and him of the terrible day of the Lord, and exhorted them to re|pent and turn to Chri&s;t. Being filled with the Lord's re|fre&s;hing power, I was not &s;en&s;ible of much hurt I had re|ceived by their blows. In the afternoon I went to another &s;teeple-hou&s;e, but the prie&s;t had done before I got thither: &s;o I preached repentance to the people that were left, and directed them to their inward teacher, Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>From hence I went to Balby, and Douca&s;ter, where I had formerly preached repentance on the market-day; which had made a noi&s;e and alarm in the country. On fir&s;t-day I went to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and after the prie&s;t had done, I &s;poke to him and the people what the Lord commanded me: and they were in a great rage, hurried me out, threw me down, and haled me before the magi&s;trates. A long ex|amination they made of me, and much work I had with them. They threatened my life, if ever I came there again; and that they would leave me to the mercy of the people. Neverthele&s;s I declared truth among&s;t them, and directed them to the light of Chri&s;t in them; te&s;tifying unto them, <Q>That God was come to teach his people him&s;elf, whether they would hear or forbear.</Q> After awhile they put us out (for &s;ome friends were with me) among the rude multi|tude, and they &s;toned us down the &s;treets. An innkeep|er, a bailiff, came and took us into his hou&s;e; and they broke his head, &s;o that the blood ran down his face, with the &s;tones that they threw at us. We &s;taid awhile in his hou&s;e, and &s;hewed the more &s;ober people the prie&s;t's fruits. Then we went away to Balby about a mile off. The rude people laid wait for us, and &s;toned us down the lane; but, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, we did not receive much hurt.</P>
<P>The next fir&s;t-day I went to Tickhill, whither the friends of that &s;ide gathered together, and a mighty brokenne&s;s by the power of God there was among&s;t the people. I went out of the meeting, being moved of God to go to the &s;tee|ple-hou&s;e. When I came there, I found the prie&s;t and mo&s;t of the chief of the pari&s;h together in the chancel. I went up to them, and began to &s;peak; but they immediate|ly fell upon me; the clerk up with his bible, as I was &s;peaking, and <Q>&s;truck me on the face with it, &s;o that my face gu&s;hed out with blood; and I bled exceedingly in the &s;teeple-hou&s;e.</Q> The people cried, <Q>Let us have him out of the church.</Q> When they had got me out, they beat me exceedingly, threw me down, and turned me
<PB N="84" REF="037441_0161_100D8EA9B4AF7CE0">over a hedge. They afterwards dragged me through a hou&s;e into the &s;treet, &s;toning and beating me as they dragged me along; &s;o that I was all over be&s;meared with blood and dirt. They got my hat from me, which I never had again. Yet when I was got upon my legs, I declared the word of life, &s;hewed them the fruits of their teacher, and how they di&s;honoured chri&s;tianity. After awhile I got into the meet|ing again among&s;t friends, and the prie&s;t and people coming by the hou&s;e, I went with friends into the yard, and there &s;poke to the prie&s;t and people. The prie&s;t &s;cof|fed at us, and called us Quakers. But the Lord's power was &s;o over them, and the word of life was declared in &s;uch authority and dread to them, that the prie&s;t fell a trembling him&s;elf; and one of the people &s;aid, <Q>Look how the prie&s;t trembles and &s;hakes, he is turned a Quaker al&s;o.</Q> When the meeting was over, friends departed; and I went with|out my hat to Balby about &s;even or eight miles. Friends were much abu&s;ed that day by the prie&s;t and his people: in&s;omuch that &s;ome moderate ju&s;tices hearing of it, two or three of them came and &s;ate at the town to examine the bu&s;ine&s;s. He that had &s;hed my blood was afraid of having his hand cut off, for &s;triking me in the church, as they cal|led it; but I forgave him, and would not appear again&s;t him.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this year 1652, great rage got up in prie&s;ts and people, and in &s;ome of the magi&s;trates, in the we&s;t riding of York&s;hire, again&s;t the truth and friends, in|&s;omuch, that the prie&s;t of Warn&s;worth procured a warrant from the ju&s;tices again&s;t me and Thomas Aldam, to be ex|ecuted in any part of the we&s;t riding of York&s;hire. At the &s;ame time I had a vi&s;ion of a bear and two great ma&s;tiff dogs; that I &s;hould pa&s;s by them, and they &s;hould do me no hurt: and it proved &s;o. For the con&s;table took Tho|mas Aldam, and carried him to York. I went with Thomas twenty miles towards York, and the con&s;table had a war|rant for me al&s;o, and &s;aid, <Q>He &s;aw me, but he was loth to trouble &s;trangers;</Q> but Thomas Aldam was his neigh|bour. So the Lord's power re&s;trained him, that he had not power to meddle with me. We went to lieutenant Roper's, where we had a great meeting of many con&s;iderable men. The truth was powerfully declared among&s;t them, the &s;crip|tures wonderfully opened, the parables and &s;ayings of Chri&s;t expounded, the &s;tate of the church in the apo&s;tles days plainly &s;et forth, and the apo&s;tacy &s;ince from that &s;tate di&s;|covered.
<PB N="85" REF="037441_0162_100D8EAC45B4E060">The truth had great dominion that day: &s;o that tho&s;e great men pre&s;ent did generally confe&s;s to it, &s;aying, <Q>They believed this principle mu&s;t go over the whole world.</Q> There were at this meeting James Nayler, Tho|mas Goodyear, and William Dew&s;bury, who had been con|vinced the year before, and Richard Farn&s;worth al&s;o. The con&s;table &s;taid with Thomas Aldam till the meeting was over, and then went towards York pri&s;on; but did not meddle with me.</P>
<P>From hence I went to Wakefield, and the fir&s;t-day after to a &s;teeple-hou&s;e, where James Nayler had been a mem|ber of an independent church; but, upon his receiving truth, he was excommunicated. When I came in, and the prie&s;t had done, the people called me to come to the prie&s;t; which I did: but when I began to declare the word of life to them, and to lay open the deceit of the prie&s;t, they ru&s;hed upon me on a &s;udden, thru&s;t me out at the other door, punching and beating me, and cried <Q>Let us have him to the &s;tocks.</Q> But the Lord's power was over them, and &s;o re&s;trained them, that they were not able to put me in. So I pa&s;&s;ed away to the meeting, where were a great many profe&s;&s;ors and friendly people gathered, and a great convincement there was; for the people were mightily &s;a|tisfied, that they were directed to the Lord's teaching in them&s;elves. Here we got lodging; for four of us had lain abroad under a hedge the night before, there being then few friends in that place.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day Richard Farn&s;worth went to another great &s;teeple-hou&s;e belonging to a high prie&s;t, and declared the word of truth unto the people; and great &s;ervice he had among&s;t them: for the Lord's dread and power was mighti|ly over all.</P>
<P>The prie&s;t of that church, which James Nayler had been a member of, who&s;e name was Mar&s;hal, rai&s;ed many wicked &s;landers upon me, <Q>That I carried bottles about with me, and made people drink of my bottles, which made them follow me.</Q> And, <Q>That I rid upon a great black hor&s;e, and was &s;een in one country upon my black hor&s;e in one hour, and in the &s;ame hour in another country three&s;core miles off;</Q> and <Q>That I &s;hould give a fellow money to follow me when I was on my black hor&s;e.</Q> With the&s;e helli&s;h lies he fed his people, to make them think evil of the truth which I had declared among&s;t them. But by the&s;e lies he preached many of his hearers away
<PB N="86" REF="037441_0163_100D8EADDA1C7A90">from him; for I travelled on foot, and had no hor&s;e at that time; and that the people generally knew. The Lord &s;oon after met with this envious prie&s;t, and cut him off in his wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>After this I came to High-Town, where dwelt a woman who had been convinced a little before. We went to her hou&s;e, and had a meeting. The town's people gathered to|gether; we declared the truth to them, had &s;ome &s;ervice for the Lord among&s;t them; and they pa&s;&s;ed away again peaceably. But there was a widow woman in the town, who&s;e name was Green, who, being filled with envy, went to one called a gentleman in the town, who was reported to have killed two men and one woman, and informed him again&s;t us, though he was no officer. The next morning we drew up &s;ome queries, to be &s;ent to the prie&s;t. When we had done, and were ju&s;t going away, &s;ome of the friend|ly people of the town came running, and told us, That this murdering man had &s;harpened a pike to &s;tab us, and was coming with his &s;word by his &s;ide. Being ju&s;t pa&s;|&s;ing away, we mi&s;&s;ed him. But he came to the hou&s;e where we had been; and the people generally concluded, if we had not been gone, he would have murdered &s;ome of us. That night we lay in a wood, and were very wet, for it rained exceedingly. In the morning I was moved to return to that town, when we had a full relation of this wicked man.</P>
<P>From hence we pa&s;&s;ed to an hou&s;e at Bradford, where we met with Richard Farn&s;worth, from whom we had parted a little before. When we came in they &s;et meat before us; but as I was going to eat, the word of the Lord came to me, &s;aying, <Q>Eat not the bread of &s;uch as have an evil eye.</Q> Immediately I aro&s;e from the table, and ate no|thing. After I had exhorted the family to turn to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and hearken to his teachings in their own hearts, we departed thence.</P>
<P>As we travelled through the country, preaching repent|ance to the people, we came into a market-town, where a lecture was held that day. I went into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, where many prie&s;ts, profe&s;&s;ors and people were. The prie&s;t that preached, took for his text tho&s;e words of Jeremiah, chap. 5. ver. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. "My people love to have it &s;o;" leaving out the foregoing words, viz. <Q>The prophets prophe&s;y fal&s;ely, and the prie&s;ts bear rule by their means.</Q> I &s;hewed the people his deceit; and directed them to Chri&s;t,
<PB N="87" REF="037441_0164_100D8EB0378A3F18">the true teacher within; declaring, that God was come to teach his people him&s;elf, and to bring them off from all the world's teachers and hirelings; that they might come to re|ceive freely from him. Then warning them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all fle&s;h, I pa&s;&s;ed from thence without much oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>At night we came to a country place, where there was no publick hou&s;e near. The people de&s;ired us to &s;tay all night; which we did, and had good &s;ervice for the Lord, declaring his truth among&s;t them.</P>
<P>The Lord had &s;aid unto me, <Q>If but one man or woman were rai&s;ed by his power, to &s;tand and live in the &s;ame Spirit that the prophets and apo&s;tles were in who gave forth the &s;criptures, that man or woman &s;hould &s;hake all the country in their profe&s;&s;ion for ten miles round.</Q> For people had the &s;criptures, but were not in the &s;ame light, power, and Spirit, which tho&s;e were in who gave forth the &s;criptures; &s;o they neither knew God, Chri&s;t, nor the &s;crip|tures aright; nor had they unity one with another, being out of the power and Spirit of God. Therefore we warned all, where-ever we met them, of the day of the Lord that was coming upon them.</P>
<P>As we travelled, we came near a very great high hill, called Pendlehill, and I was moved of the Lord to go up to the top of it; which I did with much ado, it was &s;o very &s;teep and high. When I was come to the top, I &s;aw the &s;ea bordering upon Lanca&s;hire. From the top of this hill the Lord let me &s;ee in what places he had a great peo|ple to be gathered. As I went down, I found a &s;pring of water in the &s;ide of the hill, with which I refre&s;hed my&s;elf; having eaten or drunk but little &s;everal days before.</P>
<P>At night we came to an inn, and declared truth to the man of the hou&s;e, and wrote a paper to the prie&s;ts and pro|fe&s;&s;ors, declaring <Q>the day of the Lord, and that Chri&s;t was come to teach people him&s;elf, by his power and Spi|rit in their hearts, and to bring people off from all the world's ways and teachers, to his own free teaching who had bought them, and was the Saviour of all them that believed in him.</Q> The man of the hou&s;e &s;pread the pa|per abroad, and was him&s;elf mightily affected with the truth. Here the Lord opened unto me, and let me &s;ee a great people in white raiment by a river-&s;ide, coming to the Lord. The place that I &s;aw them in was about Went|zerdale and Sedbergh.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="037441_0165_100D8EB3571F0970">
The next day we travelled on, and at night got a little fern to put under us, and lay upon a common. Next morning we reached a town, where Richard Farn&s;worth parted from me; and then I travelled alone again. I came up Wentzerdale, and at the market-town in that dale there was a lecture on the market-day. I went into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e; and after the prie&s;t had done, <Q>proclaimed the day of the Lord to the prie&s;t and people; warning them to turn from the darkne&s;s to the light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they might come to know God and Chri&s;t aright, and to receive his teaching, who teach|eth freely.</Q> Largely and freely did I declare the word of life unto them, and had not much per&s;ecution there. After|wards I pa&s;&s;ed up the dales, warning people to fear God; and preaching the everla&s;ting go&s;pel. In my way I came to a great hou&s;e, where was a &s;choolma&s;ter; and they got me into the hou&s;e. I a&s;ked them que&s;tions about then re|ligion and wor&s;hip; and afterwards declared the truth to them. They had me into a parlour, and locked me in, pretending I was mad, and had got away from my rela|tions; and they would keep me till they could &s;end to them. But I &s;oon convinced them of their mi&s;take; and they let me forth, and would have had me to &s;tay, but I was not to &s;tay there. Having exhorted them to repentance, and directed them to the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that thro' it they might come unto him, and be &s;aved, I pa&s;&s;ed from them, and came in the night to a little alehou&s;e on a com|mon, where a company of rude fellows were drinking. Becau&s;e I would not drink with them, they &s;truck me with their clubs. But I reproved them, and brought them to be &s;omewhat cooler; and then walked out of the hou&s;e upon the common in the night. After &s;ome time one of the&s;e drunken fellows came out, and would have come clo&s;e up to me, pretending to whi&s;per to me; but perceiving he had a knife, I kept off him, and bid him repent, and fear God. So the Lord by his power pre&s;erved me from this wicked man; and he went into the hou&s;e again. Next morning I went through other dales, warning and exhorting people every where, as I pa&s;&s;ed, to repent and turn to the Lord; and &s;everal were convinced. At one hou&s;e, the man of the hou&s;e whom I afterwards &s;ound to be a kin&s;man of John Blakelin's, would have given me money, but I would not receive it.</P>
<P>As I travelled through the dales, I came to another
<PB N="89" REF="037441_0166_100D7F458D51D5F8">man's hou&s;e, who&s;e name was Tennant. I was moved to &s;peak to the family, and declare God's everla&s;ting truth to them; and as I was turning away from them, I was moved to turn again, and &s;peak to the man him&s;elf; who was con|vinced, with his family, and lived and died in the truth. Thence I came to major Bousfield's, who received me, as did &s;everal others. Some that were then convinced have &s;tool faithful ever &s;ince. I went al&s;o through Gry&s;edale, and &s;everal other of tho&s;e dales; in which &s;ome were con|vinced. In Dent many were convinced al&s;o. From major Bousfield's I came to Richard Robin&s;on's and declared the everla&s;ting truth to him.</P>
<P>The next day I went to a meeting at ju&s;tice Ben&s;on's, where met a people that were &s;eparated from the publick wor&s;hip. This was the place that I had &s;een, where a peo|ple came forth in white raiment. A large meeting it was; the people were generally convinced, and continue a large meeting &s;till of friends near Sedbergh; which was then fir&s;t gathered through my mini&s;try in the name of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>The &s;ame week there was a great fair, at which &s;ervants u&s;ed to be hired. I went and declared the day of the Lord through the fair. After I had done &s;o, I went into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e yard; and many of the people of the fair came to me, with abundance of prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors. <Q>There I declared the everla&s;ting truth of the Lord, and the word of life for &s;everal hours; &s;hewing, that the Lord was come to teach his people him&s;elf, and to bring them off from all the world's ways and teachers to Chri&s;t the true teacher, and the true way to God. I laid open their teachers, &s;hewing, that they were like tho&s;e that were of old condemned by the prophets, by Chri&s;t, and by the apo&s;tles. I exhorted the people to come off from the temples made with hands; and wait to receive the Spirit of the Lord, that they might know them&s;elves to be the temples of God.</Q> Not one of the prie&s;ts had power to open his mouth again&s;t what I declared. At la&s;t a cap|tain &s;aid, <Q>Why will you not go into the Church? This is not a fit place to preach in.</Q> I told him, I denied their church. Then &s;tood up Francis Howgill, who was preach|er to a congregation. He had not &s;een me before; yet he undertook to an&s;wer that captain; and &s;oon put him to &s;ilence. Then &s;aid Francis Howgill of me, <Q>This man &s;peaks with authority, and not as the &s;cribes.</Q> After this, I opened to the people, that that ground and hou&s;e was no
<PB N="90" REF="037441_0167_100D8EB6F59909F0">holier than another place; and that the hou&s;e is not the church, but the people, whom Chri&s;t is the head of. After awhile the prie&s;ts came up to me, and I warned them to repent. One of them &s;aid, I was mad; &s;o they turned away. But many were convinced there that day, who were glad to hear the truth declared, and received it with joy. Among&s;t the&s;e was captain Ward, who received the truth in the love of it, and lived and died in it.</P>
<P>The next fir&s;t-day I came to Firbank Chapel in We&s;t|moreland, where Francis Howgill and John Audland had been preaching in the morning. The chapel was full of people, &s;o that many could not get in. Francis &s;aid, He thought I looked into the chapel, and his &s;pirit was ready to &s;ail, the Lord': power did &s;o &s;urprize him: but I did not look in. They made ha&s;te, and had quickly done, and they and &s;ome of the people went to dinner; but abundance &s;taid till they came again. John Blakelin and others came to me, and de&s;ired me not to reprove them publickly; for they were not pari&s;h-teachers, but pretty tender men. I could nor tell them whether I &s;hould or no, though I had not at that time any drawings to declare publickly again&s;t them; but I &s;aid, They mu&s;t leave me to the Lord's mov|ings. While others were gone to dinner, I went to a brook, got a little water, and then came and &s;at down on the top of a rock hard by the chapel. In the afternoon the people gathered about me, with &s;everal of their preachers. It was judged there were above a thou&s;and people; to whom I declared God's everla&s;ting truth and word of life freely and largely for about the &s;pace of three hours; directing all to the Spirit of God in them&s;elves; that they might be turned from darkne&s;s to light, and believe in it, that they might become the children of it, and might be turned from the power of Satan unto God; and by the Spirit of truth might be led into all truth, and &s;en&s;ibly under&s;tand the words of the prophets, of Chri&s;t, and of the apo&s;tles; and might all come to know Chri&s;t to be their teacher to in&s;truct them, their coun&s;ellor to direct them, their &s;hepherd to &s;eed them, their bi&s;hop to over&s;ee them, and their prophet to open di|vine my&s;teries to them; and might know their bodies to be prepared, &s;anctified, and made &s;it temples for God and Chri&s;t to dwell in. In the openings of heavenly life. I explained unto them the prophets, and the figures and &s;ha|dows, and directed them to Chri&s;t, the &s;ub&s;tance. Then I opened the parables and &s;ayings of Chri&s;t, and things that
<PB N="91" REF="037441_0168_100D8EB8E5DDF458">had been long hid; &s;hewing the intent and &s;cope of the apo&s;|tles writings and that their epi&s;tles were written to the elect. When I had opened that &s;tate, I &s;hewed al&s;o the &s;tate of the apo&s;tacy &s;ince the apo&s;tles days; that the prie&s;ts have got the &s;criptures, but are not in the Spirit which gave them forth; and have put them into chapter and ver&s;e, to make a trade of the holy mens words; that the teachers and prie&s;ts now are found in the &s;teps of the fal&s;e prophets, chief prie&s;ts, &s;cribes and phari&s;ees of old, and are &s;uch as the true prophets, Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles cried again&s;t, and &s;o are judged and condemned by the Spirit of the true pro|phets, of Chri&s;t, and of his apo&s;tles; and that none in that Spirit could own them. Many old people went into the chapel, and looked out at the windows; thinking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;trange thing to &s;ee a man preach on an hill or mountain, and not in their church, as they called it; whereupon I was moved to inform the people, <Q>That the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and the ground whereon it &s;tood, were no more holy than that mountain; and that tho&s;e temples, which they called the dreadful hou&s;es of God, were not &s;et up by the com|mand of God and of Chri&s;t; nor their prie&s;ts called, as Aaron's prie&s;thood was; nor their tythes appointed by God, as tho&s;e among&s;t the Jews were: but that Chri&s;t was come, who ended both the temple and its wor&s;hip, and the prie&s;ts and their tythes; and all now &s;hould hearken to him: for he &s;aid, "Learn of me:" and God &s;aid of him, <Q>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed; hear ye him.</Q> I declared that the Lord God had &s;ent me to preach the everla&s;ting go&s;pel and word of life among&s;t them; and to bring them off from all the&s;e temples, tythes, prie&s;ts, and rudiments of the world, which had got up &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, and had been &s;et up by &s;uch as had erred from the Spirit and power that the apo&s;tles were in.</Q> Very largely was I opened at this meet|ing; the Lord's convincing power accompanied my mini|&s;try, and reached home to the hearts of the people; where|by many were convinced, and all the teachers of that con|gregation (who were many) were convinced of God's ever|la&s;ting truth.</P>
<P>After the meeting, I went to John Audland's, and from thence to Pre&s;ton Patrick Chapel, where a great meeting was appointed; to which I went, and had a large opportu|nity to preach the everla&s;ting go&s;pel; acquainting the peo|ple that the end of my coming into that place was not to
<PB N="92" REF="037441_0169_100D8EBB51C68980">hold it up; no more than the apo&s;tles going into the Jew|i&s;h &s;ynagogues and temple was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> uphold tho&s;e; but to bring them off from all &s;uch things (as the apo&s;tles brought the &s;aints of old from off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Jewi&s;h temple and Aaron's prie&s;thood) that they might come to witne&s;s their bodies to be the temples of God, and Chri&s;t in them to be their teacher.</P>
<P>From this place I went to Kendal, where a meeting was appointed in the town-hall, in which I declared the word of life among&s;t the people, &s;hewing them, <Q>How they might come to the &s;aving knowledge of Chri&s;t, and to have a right under&s;tanding of the holy &s;criptures; opening to them what it was that would lead them into the way of reconciliation with God; and what would be their con|demnation.</Q> After the meeting I &s;taid awhile in the town: &s;everal were convinced there, and many appeared loving. One Cork met me in the &s;treet, and would have given me a roll of tobacco. I accepted his love, but did not receive the tobacco.</P>
<P>From thence I went to Under-barrow, to Miles Bate|man's; and &s;everal going along with me, great rea&s;onings I had with them, e&s;pecially with Edward Burrough. At night the prie&s;t and many profe&s;&s;ors came to the hou&s;e; and a great deal of di&s;puting I had with them. Supper being provided for the prie&s;t and the re&s;t of the company. I had not freedom to eat with them; but told them, If they would appoint a meeting for the next day at the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and acquaint the people with it, I might meet them. They had a great deal of rea&s;soning about it; &s;ome being for, and &s;ome again&s;t it. In the morning, after I had &s;poken to them again concerning the meeting, as I walked upon a bank by the hou&s;e, there came &s;everal poor travellers, a&s;king relief, who I &s;aw were in nece&s;&s;ity; and they gave them nothing, but &s;aid they were cheats. It grieved me to &s;ee &s;uch hard-heartedne&s;s among&s;t profe&s;&s;ors; whereupon, when they were gone in to their breakfa&s;t, I ran after the poor people about a quarter of a mile, and gave them &s;ome money. Mean while &s;ome that were in the hou&s;e, coming out, and &s;eeing me a quarter of a mile off, &s;aid, I could not have gone &s;o far in &s;uch an in&s;tant, if I had not had wings. Hereupon the meeting was like to have been put by; for they were filled with &s;uch &s;trange thoughts concerning me, that many of them were again&s;t having a meeting with me. I told them. I ran after tho&s;e poor people to give them &s;orme mo|ney;
<PB N="93" REF="037441_0170_100D8EBDB573E620">being grieved at their hard-heartedne&s;s, who gave them nothing. Then came Miles and Stephen Hubber&s;ty; who, being more &s;imple-hearted men, would have the meeting held. So to the chapel I went, and the prie&s;t came. A great meeting there was, and the way of life and &s;alvation was opened; and after awhile the prie&s;t fled away. Many of Crook and Under-barrow were convinced that day, re|ceived the word of life, and &s;tood fa&s;t in it under the teach|ing of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. After I had declared the truth to them for &s;ome hours, and the meeting was ended, the chief con|&s;table and &s;ome other profe&s;&s;ors fell to rea&s;oning with me in the chapel yard. Whereupon I took a bible and opened the &s;criptures. and dealt tenderly with them, as one would do with a child. They that were in the light of Chri&s;t and Spirit of God, knew when I &s;pake &s;cripture, though I did not mention chapter and ver&s;e, after the prie&s;ts for to them.</P>
<P>From hence I went with an ancient man, who&s;e heart the Lord had opened, and he invited me to his hou&s;e; his name was Jatnes Dickin&s;on. He was convinced that day, received the truth, and lived and died in it.</P>
<P>I came the next day to James Taylor's, of Newton in Cartmel, in Lanca&s;hire. On fir&s;t-day I went to the chapel, where prie&s;t Camelford u&s;ed to preach; and after he had done, I began to &s;peak the word of life to the people. But he was in &s;uch a rage, did &s;o fret, and was &s;o peevi&s;h, that he had no patience to hear; but &s;tirred up the rude multi|tude, who haled me out, &s;truck, and threw me headlong over a &s;tone wall. Yet ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, his power pre|&s;erved me. He that did this violence to me, was John Knipe, a wicked man, whom afterwards the Lord cut off. There was a youth in the chapel, writing after the prie&s;t. I was moved to &s;peak to him, and he came to be convinced, and received a part of the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel: his name was John Brathwait.</P>
<P>Then I went to an alehou&s;e, to which many re&s;orted betwixt the time of their morning and afternoon preaching; and had a great deal of rea&s;oning with the people, declaring to them, That God was come to teach his people him&s;elf, and to bring them off from all fal&s;e teachers, &s;uch as the prophets. Chri&s;t, and the apo&s;tles cried again&s;t. Many re|ceived the word of life at that time, and abode in it.</P>
<P>In the afternoon I went about two or three miles to a &s;teeple-hou&s;e or chapel called Lyndal, When the prie&s;t
<PB N="94" REF="037441_0171_100D8EBF4D5F8DB0">had done, I &s;poke to him and the people what the Lord commanded me, and there were great oppo&s;ers; but after|wards they came to be convinced. After this I went to captain Sands, who with his wife &s;eemed &s;omewhat affected with truth, and if they could have held the world and truth together, they would have received it; but they were hypo|crites, and he a very chaffy light man. Wherefore I re|proved him for his lightne&s;s and je&s;ting; telling him, It was not &s;eemly in a great profe&s;&s;or as he was. Thereupon he told me. He had a &s;on, who upon his death-bed had al&s;o reproved him for it, and warned him of it. But he neither regarded the admonition of his dying &s;on, nor the reproofs of God's Spirit in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>From hence I went to Ulver&s;tone, and to Swarthmore to judge Fell's; whither came one Lampitt, a prie&s;t, who was an high notioni&s;t. With him I had a great deal of rea&s;oning; for he would talk of high notions and perfection, and thereby deceived the people. He would have owned me but I could not own or join with him, he was &s;o full of firth. He &s;aid. He was above John; and made as though he knew all things. But I told him, <Q>Death reign|ed from Adam to Mo&s;es; and that he was under death, and knew not Mo&s;es: for Mo&s;es &s;aw the paradi&s;e of God; but he knew neither Mo&s;es, nor the prophets, nor John.</Q> For that crooked and rough nature &s;tood in him, and the mountain of &s;in and corruption; and the way was not prepared in him for the Lord. He confe&s;&s;ed he had been under a cro&s;s in things; but now he could &s;ing p&s;alms, and do any thing. I told him, <Q>Now he could &s;ee a thief, and join hand in hand with him: but he could not preach Mo&s;es, nor the prophets, nor John, nor Chri&s;t, except he were in the &s;ame Spirit that they were in.</Q> Margaret Fell had been abroad in the day-time; and at night her children told her, prie&s;t Lampitt and I had di&s;agreed; which &s;omewhat troubled her, becau&s;e &s;he was in profe&s;&s;ion with him; but he hid his dirty actions from them. At night we had great rea&s;oning; and I declared the truth to her and her family. Next day Lampitt came again, and I had a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e with him before Margaret Fell, who then clearly di&s;cerned the prie&s;t. A convincement of the Lord's truth came upon her and her family. Soon after a day was to be ob&s;erved for an humi|liation; and Margaret Fell a&s;ked me to go with her to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e at Ulver&s;tone, for &s;he was not wholly come
<PB N="95" REF="037441_0172_100D8EC121CDC348">off from them: I replied, <Q>I mu&s;t do as I am ordered by the Lord.</Q> So I left her, and walked into the fields; and the word of the Lord came to me, &s;aying, <Q>Go to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e after them.</Q> When I came, Lampitt was &s;inging with his people; but his &s;pirit was &s;o foul, and the matter they &s;ung &s;o un&s;uitable to their &s;tates, that after they had done &s;inging, I was moved of the Lord to &s;peak to him and the people. The word of the Lord to them was, <Q>He is not a Jew that is one outward; but he is a Jew that is one inward, who&s;e prai&s;e is not of man, but of God.</Q> Then, as the Lord opened further, I &s;hewed them, <Q>That He was come to teach his people by his Spirit, and to bring them off from all their old ways, religions, churches, and wor&s;hips; for all their religions, wor&s;hips, and ways were but talking of other men's words; but they were out of the life and Spirit which tho&s;e were in who gave them forth.</Q> Then cried out one ju&s;tice Sawrey. <Q>Take him away;</Q> but judge Fell's wife &s;aid to the officers, <Q>Let him alone; why may he not &s;peak, as well as any other?</Q> Lampitt al&s;o, the prie&s;t, in deceit, &s;aid, "Let him &s;peak." So at length, when I had declared a pretty while, ju&s;tice Sawrey cau&s;ed the con&s;table to put me out; and then I &s;poke to the people in the grave-yard.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t-day after, I was moved to go to Aldenham &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and when the prie&s;t had done, I &s;poke to him; but he got away. Then I declared the word of life to the people, and warned them to turn to the Lord.</P>
<P>From thence I pa&s;&s;ed to Ram&s;ide, where was a chapel, in which Thomas. Law&s;on u&s;ed to preach, who was an eminent prie&s;t. He very lovingly acquainted his people in the morning of my coming in the afternoon; by which means many were gathered together. When I came, I &s;aw there was no place &s;o convenient as the chapel: where|fore I went into the chapel, and all was quiet. Thomas Law&s;on went not up into his pulpit, but left all the time to me. The everla&s;ting day of the eternal God was pro|claimed that day, and the everla&s;ting truth was largely declared; which reached and entered into the hearts of the people, and many received the truth in the love of it. This prie&s;t came to be convinced, left his chapel, threw off his preaching for hire, and came to preach the Lord Je&s;us and his kingdom freely. After that &s;ome rude peo|ple ca&s;t &s;candals upon him, and thought to have done him an injury; but he was carried over all, grew in the wi&s;|dom
<PB N="96" REF="037441_0173_100D8EC442F9BBE8">of God mightily, and proved very &s;erviceable in his place.</P>
<P>I returned to Swarthmore again, and the next fir&s;t-day went to Dalton &s;teeple-hou&s;e; where, after the prie&s;t had done, I declared the word of life to the people, that they might be turned from darkne&s;s to light, from the power of Satan to God; and might come off from their &s;uper&s;titious ways, and from their teachers made by man, to Chri&s;t the true and living way, to be taught of him.</P>
<P>From thence I went into the i&s;land of Walnah; and after the prie&s;t had done. I &s;poke to him, but he got away. Then I declared the truth to the people, but they were &s;omething rude. I went to &s;peak with the prie&s;t at his hou&s;e, but he would not be &s;een. The people &s;aid, he went to hide him&s;elf in the hay-mow, and they looked for him there, but could not find him. Then they &s;aid, he was gone to hide him&s;elf in the &s;tanding corn, but they could not find him there neither. I went to James Lan|ca&s;ter's, who was convinced in the i&s;land, and from thence returned to Swarthmore, where the Lord's power &s;eized upon Margaret Fell, her daughter Sarah, and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>Then I went to Becli&s;&s;, where Leonard Fell was convin|ced, and became a mini&s;ter of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel. Se|veral others were convinced there, and came into obedience to the truth. Here the people &s;aid, they could not di&s;pute; and would fain have put &s;ome other to hold talk with me; but I bid them, <Q>Fear the Lord; and not in a light way hold a talk of the Lord's words, but put the things in practice.</Q> I directed them to the Divine Light <Q>of Chri&s;t and his Spirit in their hearts, which would let them &s;ee all the evil thoughts, words, and actions, that they had thought, &s;poken, and acted; by which light they might &s;ee their &s;in, and al&s;o their Saviour Chri&s;t Je&s;us to &s;ave them from their &s;ins. This I told them was their fir&s;t &s;tep to peace, even to &s;tand &s;till in the light that &s;hewed them their &s;ins and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; by which they might come to &s;ee they were in the fall of old Adam, in darkne&s;s and death, &s;trangers to the covenant of promi&s;e, and without God in the world: and by the &s;ame light they might &s;ee Chri&s;t that died for them to be their Re|deemer and Saviour, and their way to God.</Q></P>
<P>After this I went to a chapel beyond Glea&s;ton: which was built, but never a prie&s;t had preached in it. Thither
<PB N="97" REF="037441_0174_100D8EC64D9A5878">the country people came; and a quiet, peaceable meeting it was, in which the word of life was declared, and many were convinced of the truth about Glea&s;ton.</P>
<P>From thence I returned to Swarthmore again. After I had &s;taid a few days, and mo&s;t of the family were convin|ced, I went into We&s;tmoreland, where prie&s;t Lampitt had been among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors on Kendal &s;ide, and had mightily incen&s;ed them again&s;t me; telling them I held many &s;trange things. I met with tho&s;e that he had &s;o in|cen&s;ed, &s;ate up all night with them at James Dickin&s;on's, and an&s;wered all their objections. They were both tho|roughly &s;atisfied with the truth I had declared, and di&s;&s;ati&s;fied with him and his lies, &s;o that he clearly lo&s;t the be&s;t of his hearers and followers, who hereby came to &s;ee his de|ceit, and for&s;ook him.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed to John Audland's and Gerva&s;e Ben&s;on's, and had great meetings among&s;t tho&s;e that had been convinced before. I pa&s;&s;ed to John Blakelin's and Richard Robin|&s;on's, where I had mighty meetings, and then towards Gri&s;edale.</P>
<P>Soon after, judge Fell being come home, Margaret his wi&s;e &s;ent to me, de&s;iring me to return thither; and I, feeling freedom from the Lord &s;o to do, went back to Swarthmore. I found the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors, and ju&s;tice Sawrey, had much incen&s;ed judge Fell and captain Sands again&s;t the truth by their lies; but when I came to &s;peak with him, I an&s;wered all his objections, and &s;o thorough|ly &s;atisfied him by the &s;criptures, that he was convinced in his judgment. He a&s;ked me, <Q>If I was that George Fox whom ju&s;tice Robin&s;on &s;poke &s;o much in commendation of among&s;t many of the parliament men?</Q> I told him, I had been with ju&s;tice Robin&s;on, and ju&s;tice Hotham, in York&s;hire, who were very civil and loving to me; and that they were convinced in their judgment by the Spirit of God, that the principle which I bore te&s;timony to was the truth, and they &s;aw beyond the prie&s;ts of the nation; &s;o that they and many others were now come to be wi&s;er than their teachers. After we had di&s;cour&s;ed a pretty while together, judge Fell him&s;elf was &s;atisfied al&s;o, and came to &s;ee, by the openings of the Spirit of God in his heart, over all the prie&s;ts and teachers of the world; and did not go to hear them for &s;ome years before he died; for he knew it was the truth that I declared, and that Chri&s;t was the teacher of his people, and their Saviour. He &s;ometimes
<PB N="98" REF="037441_0175_100D8EC7DEBC0AC0">wi&s;hed that I was awhile with judge Brad&s;haw to di&s;cour&s;e with him. There came to judge Fell's captain Sands be|fore-mentioned, endeavouring to incen&s;e the judge again&s;t me; for he was an evil-minded man, and full of envy again&s;t me; yet he could &s;peak high things, u&s;e the &s;crip|ture-words, and &s;ay, "Behold, I make all things new." But I told him, Then he mu&s;t have a new God; for his God was his belly. Be&s;ides him came al&s;o that envious ju&s;tice John Sawrey. I told him, <Q>His heart was rotten, and he was full of hypocri&s;y to the brim.</Q> Several others al&s;o carne, who&s;e &s;tates the Lord gave me a di&s;cern|ing of; and I &s;poke to their conditions. While I was in tho&s;e parts, Richard Farn&s;worth and James Nayler came to &s;ee me and the family; and judge Fell, being &s;atisfied that it was the way of truth, notwith&s;tanding all their op|po&s;ition, &s;uffered the meeting to be kept at his hou&s;e; and a great meeting was &s;ettled there in the Lord's power, which hath continued near forty years, until the year 1690, that a new meeting-hou&s;e was erected near it.</P>
<P>After I had &s;taid awhile, and the meeting there was well &s;ettled, I departed to Under-barrow, where I had a great meeting. From thence I went to Kellet, and had a great meeting at Robert Withers's, to which &s;everal came from Lanca&s;ter, and &s;ome from York; and many were convin|ced. On the market-day I went to Lanca&s;ter, and &s;poke through the market in the dreadful power of God; declar|ing the day of the Lord to the people, and crying out again&s;t all their deceitful merchandize. I preached right|eou&s;ne&s;s and truth unto them, which all &s;hould follow after, walk and live in; directing them how and where they might find and receive the Spirit of God to guide them thereinto. After I had cleared my&s;elf in the market, I went to my lodging, whither &s;everal people came; and many were convinced, who &s;tood faithful to the truth.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t-day following, in the forenoon, I had a great meeting in the &s;treet at Lanca&s;ter, among&s;t the &s;oldiers and people, to whom I declared the word of life, and the ever|la&s;ting truth. I opened unto them, That all the traditions they had lived in, all their wor&s;hips and religions, and the profe&s;&s;ion they made of the &s;criptures, were good for no|thing, while they lived out of the life and power which tho&s;e were in who gave forth the &s;criptures. I directed them to the light of Chri&s;t, the heavenly man, and to the Spirit of God in their own hearts, that they might come to
<PB N="99" REF="037441_0176_100D8EC982ACA1A0">be acquainted with God and Chri&s;t, receive him for their teacher, and kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w his kingdom &s;et up in them.</P>
<P>In the afternoon I went to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e at Lanca&s;ter, and declared the truth to the prie&s;t and people; laying open before them the deceit they lived in, and directing them to the power and Spirit of God which they wanted. But they haled me out, and &s;toned me along the &s;treet till I came to John Law&s;on's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Another fir&s;t-day I went to a &s;teeple-hou&s;e by the water|&s;ide, where one Whitehead was prie&s;t; to whom and to the people I declared the truth in the dreadful power of God. There came a doctor, &s;o full of envy, that he &s;aid, <Q>He could find in his heart to run me through with his ra|pier, though he was hanged for it the next day;</Q> yet this man came afterwards to be convinced of the truth, &s;o far as to be loving to friends. Some were convinced there|abouts, who willingly &s;ate down under the mini&s;try of Chri&s;t, their teacher; and a meeting was &s;ettled there in the power of God, which has continued to this day.</P>
<P>After this I returned into We&s;tmoreland, and &s;poke through Kendal on a market-day. So dreadful was the power of God upon me, that people flew like chaff be|fore me into their hou&s;es. I warned them of the mighty day of the Lord, and exhorted them to hearken to the voice of God in their own hearts, who was now come to teach his people him&s;elf. When &s;ome oppo&s;ed, many others took my part. At la&s;t &s;ome fell to fighting about me; but I went and &s;poke to them, and they parted again. Several were convinced.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t-day after I had a very large meeting in Under|barrow at Miles Bateman's, where I was moved to declare, <Q>That all people in the fall were gone from the image of God, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and holine&s;s, and were become as wells without the water of life, as clouds without the hea|venly rain, as trees without the heavenly fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">; and were degenerated into the nature of bea&s;ts, of &s;e pents, of tall cedars, of oaks, of bulls, and of heifers: &s;o that they might read the natures of the&s;e creatures within, as the prophets de&s;cribed them to the people of old, that were out of truth. I opened to them, how &s;ome were in the nature of dogs and &s;wine, biting and reading; &s;ome in the nature of briers, thi&s;tles, and thorns; &s;ome like the owls and dragons in the night; &s;ome like the wild a&s;&s;es and hor&s;es, &s;nuffing up the wind; and &s;ome like the
<PB N="100" REF="037441_0177_100D8ECD21A88FD8">mountains and rocks, and crooked and rough ways. Wherefore I exhorted them to read the&s;e things within in their own natures, as well as without: and that, when they read without of the wandering &s;tars, they &s;hould look within, and &s;ee how they have wandered from the bright and morning &s;tar. And they &s;hould con&s;ider, that as the fallow ground in their fields mu&s;t be plowed up before it would bear &s;eed to them, &s;o mu&s;t the fallow ground of their hearts be plowed up before they could bear &s;eed to God. All the&s;e names and things I &s;hewed were &s;poken of and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an and woman, &s;ince they fell from the image of God; but as they come to be renewed again into the image of God, they come out of the natures of the&s;e things, and &s;o out of the names thereof.</Q> Many more &s;uch things were declared to them, and they were turned to the light of Chri&s;t, by which they might come to know and receive him, and might witne&s;s him to be their &s;ub|&s;tance, their way, their &s;alvation and true teacher. Many were convinced at that time.</P>
<P>After I had travelled up and down in tho&s;e countries, having great meetings. I came to Swarthmore again; and when I had vi&s;ited friends awhile in tho&s;e parts, I heard of a great meeting the prie&s;ts were to have at Ulver&s;tone on a lecture-day. I went to it, and into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e in the dread and power of the Lord. When the prie&s;t had done, I &s;poke among them the word of the Lord, which was as an hammer, and as a fire among&s;t them. And though Lampitt, the prie&s;t of the place, had been at variance with mo&s;t of the prie&s;ts before, yet again&s;t the truth they all joined together. But the mighty power of the Lord was over all; and &s;o wonderful was the appearance thereof, that prie&s;t Bennet &s;aid, "The church &s;hook;" in&s;omuch that he was afraid and trembled. And after he had &s;poken a few confu&s;ed words, he ha&s;tened out for fear the &s;teeple|hou&s;e would fall on his head. There were many prie&s;ts got together, but they had no power as yet to per&s;ecute.</P>
<P>When I had cleared my con&s;cience among&s;t them, I went to Swarthmore again. Thither came four or five of the prie&s;ts. In di&s;cour&s;e, I a&s;ked them, <Q>Whether any one of them could &s;ay, he ever had the word of the Lord to go and &s;peak to &s;uch or &s;uch a people?</Q> None of them dur&s;t &s;ay he had; but one of them bur&s;t into a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid, <Q>He could &s;peak his experiences as well as I,</Q> I told him experience was one thing; but to receive
<PB N="101" REF="037441_0178_100D8ECF56C7A270">and go with a me&s;&s;age, and to have a word from the Lord as the prophets and apo&s;tles had, and as I had had to them, was another thing. And therefore I put it to them again; <Q>Could any one of them &s;ay, he ever had a command or word from the Lord immediately at any time?</Q> But none of them could &s;ay &s;o. Then I told them, The fal&s;e prophets, fal&s;e apo&s;tles, and antichri&s;ts, could u&s;e the words of the true prophets, true apo&s;tles, and of Chri&s;t, and would &s;peak of other men's experiences, though them&s;elves never knew nor heard the voice of God and Chri&s;t: and &s;uch as they might get the good words and experiences of others. This puzzled them much, and laid them open. For at another time, when I was di&s;cour&s;ing with &s;everal prie&s;ts at judge Fell's hou&s;e, and he was by, I a&s;ked them the &s;ame que&s;tion, <Q>Whether any of them ever heard the voice of God or Chri&s;t, to bid him to go to &s;uch or &s;uch a people, to declare his word or me&s;&s;age unto them!</Q> for any one, I told them, that could but read, might declare the experiences of the prophets and apo&s;tles, which were recorded in the &s;criptures. Hereupon Thomas Taylor, an ancient prie&s;t, did ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s before judge Fell, <Q>That he had never heard the voice of God, nor of Chri&s;t, to &s;end him to any people; but he &s;poke his experiences, and the experiences of the &s;aints in former ages, and that he preached.</Q> This very much confirm|ed judge Fell in the per&s;ua&s;ion, <Q>That the prie&s;ts were wrong;</Q> for he had thought formerly, as the generality of people then did, "That they were &s;ent from God."</P>
<P>Thomas Taylor was convinced at this time, and travel|led with me into We&s;tmoreland. Coming to Cro&s;land &s;leeple-hou&s;e, we found the people gathered: and the Lord opened Thomas Taylor's mouth (though he was convinced but the day before) &s;o that he declared among&s;t them, "How he had been before he was convinced," and, like the good &s;cribe converted to the kingdom, he brought forth things new and old to the people, and &s;hewed them, <Q>how the prie&s;ts were out of the way:</Q> which fretted the prie&s;t. Some little di&s;cour&s;e I had with them, but they fled away; and a precious meeting there was, wherein the Lord's pow|er was over all, and the people were directed to the Spirit of God, by which they might come to know God and Chri&s;t, and to under&s;tland the Scriptures a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. After this I pa&s;&s;ed on, vi&s;iting friends, and had very large meetings in We&s;tmoreland.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="037441_0179_100D8F8FB7AB1170">
Now began the prie&s;ts to rage more and more, and as much as they could to &s;tir up per&s;ecution. James Nayler and Francis Howgill were ca&s;t into pri&s;on in Appleby gaol, at the in&s;tigation of the malicious prie&s;ts; &s;ome of whom prophe&s;ied, <Q>That within a month we &s;hould be all &s;cat|tered again, and come to nothing.</Q> But ble&s;&s;ed for ever be the worthy name of the Lord, his work went on and pro&s;pered; for about this time John Audland, Francis Howgill, John Camm, Edward Burrough, Richard Hub|berthorn, Miles Hubber&s;ty, and Miles Halhead, with &s;e|veral others, being endued with power from on high, came forth in the work of the mini&s;try, and approved them&s;elves faithful labourers therein; travelling up and down, and preaching the go&s;pel freely; by means whereof multitudes were convinced, and many effectually turned to the Lord. Among&s;t the&s;e, Chri&s;topher Taylor was one, brother to Thomas Taylor before-mentioned, who had been preacher to a people as well as his brother; but after they had re|ceived the knowledge of the truth, they &s;oon came into obedience thereunto, and left their preaching for hire or re|wards; and having received a part of the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel, they preached Chri&s;t freely, being often &s;ent by the Lord to declare his word in &s;teeple-hou&s;es and markets, and great &s;ufferers they were.</P>
<P>After I had vi&s;ited friends in We&s;tmoreland, I returned into Lanca&s;hire, and went to Ulver&s;tone, where Lampitt was prie&s;t; who though he had preached of a people that &s;hould own the teachings of God, and had &s;aid, <Q>That men and women &s;hould come and declare the go&s;pel:</Q> yet when it came to be fulfilled, he per&s;ecuted both it and them. To this prie&s;t's hou&s;e I went, where abundance of prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors were got together after their lecture, with whom I had great di&s;putings concerning Chri&s;t and the &s;criptures; for they were loth to let their trade go down, which they made of preaching Chri&s;t's, the apo&s;tles, and prophets words. But the Lord's power went over the heads of them all, and his word of life was held forth among&s;t them; though many of them were exceeding envi|ous and devili&s;h. Yet after this, many prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors came to me from far and near. Tho&s;e that were innocent and &s;imple-minded were &s;atisfied, and went away refre&s;hed; but the fat and full were fed with judgment and &s;ent away empty: for that was the word of the Lord to be divided to them.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="037441_0180_100D7F5696074C28">
When meetings were &s;et up, and we met in private hou&s;es, Lampitt began to rage. He &s;aid, <Q>We for&s;ook the temple, and went to Jeroboam's calves hou&s;es.</Q> So many profe&s;&s;ors began to &s;ee how he was declined from that which he had formerly held and preached. Hereupon the ca&s;e of Jeroboam's calves was opened to the profe&s;&s;ors, prie&s;ts, and people. It was manife&s;ted unto them, <Q>That their hou&s;e (called churches) were more like Jeroboam's calves hou&s;es, even the old ma&s;s-hou&s;es, which were &s;et up in the darkne&s;s of popery, which they who called them&s;elves prote&s;tants, and profe&s;&s;ed to be more enlight|ened than the papi&s;ts, did &s;till hold up, altho' God had never commanded them; whereas that temple, which God had commanded at Jeru&s;alem, Chri&s;t came to end the &s;ervice of; and tho&s;e that received and believed in him, their bodies came to be the temples of God, of Chri&s;t, and of the Holy Gho&s;t, to dwell in them, and to walk in them. And &s;uch were gathered into the name of Je&s;us, who&s;e Name is above every name, and there is no &s;alvation by any other name under the whole heaven but by the name of Je&s;us. And they that were thus gather|ed met together in &s;everal dwelling-hou&s;es, which were not called the temple nor the church; but their bodies were the temples of God, and the believers were the church which Chri&s;t was the head of. So that Chri&s;t was not called the head of an old hou&s;e, which was made by mens hands, neither did he come to purcha&s;e, &s;anctify, and redeem with his blood an old hou&s;e, which they call|ed their church; but the people, which he is the head of.</Q> Much work I had in tho&s;e days with prie&s;ts and people, concerning their old ma&s;s-hou&s;es called churches; for the prie&s;ts had per&s;uaded the people, that they were the hou&s;es of God; whereas the apo&s;tle &s;ays, <Q>Who&s;e hou&s;e we are,</Q> &amp;c. Heb. iii. 6. The people in whom he dwells are God's hou&s;e. The apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>Chri&s;t pur|cha&s;ed his church with his own blood;</Q> and Chri&s;t calls his church his &s;pou&s;e, his bride, the lamb's wife: &s;o that this title church and &s;pou&s;e was not given to an old hou&s;e, but to his people the true believers.</P>
<P>On a lecture-day I was moved to go to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e at Ulver&s;tone, where were abundance of profe&s;&s;ors, prie&s;ts, and people. I went near to prie&s;t Lampitt, who was blu&s;|tering on in his preaching. After the Lord had opened my mouth to &s;peak, John Sawrey the ju&s;tice came to
<PB N="104" REF="037441_0181_100D7F59508A63E8">me, and &s;aid, <Q>If I would &s;peak according to the &s;crip|tures, I &s;hould &s;peak,</Q> I admired at him for &s;peaking &s;o to me, and told him, <Q>I would &s;peak according to the &s;criptures, and bring the &s;criptures to prove what I had to &s;ay; for I had &s;omething to &s;peak to Lampitt and to them</Q> Then he &s;aid. I &s;hould not &s;peak; contradict|ing him&s;elf, who had &s;aid ju&s;t before, <Q>I &s;hould &s;peak, if I would &s;peak according to the &s;criptures.</Q> The peo|ple were quiet, and heard me gladly, till this ju&s;tice Saw|rey (who was the fir&s;t &s;tirrer up of cruel per&s;ecution in the north) incen&s;ed them again&s;t me, and &s;et them on to hale, beat, and brui&s;e me. But now on a &s;udden the people were in a rage, and fell upon me in the &s;teeple-hou&s;e before his face, knock'd me down, kick'd me, and trampled upon me. So great was the uproar, that &s;ome tumbled over their &s;eats for fear. At la&s;t he came and took me from the people, led me out of the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and put me into the hands of the con&s;tables and other officers; bidding them whip me, and put me out of the town. They led me about a quarter of a mile, &s;ome taking hold by my col|lar, &s;ome by my arms and &s;houlders, who &s;hook and drag|ged me along. Many friendly people being come to the market, and &s;ome to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e to hear me, divers of the&s;e they knock'd down al&s;o, and broke their heads, &s;o that the blood ran down from &s;everal; and judge Fell's &s;on running after to &s;ee what they would do with me, they threw him into a ditch of water; &s;ome of them crying, "Knock the teeth out of his head." When they had haled me to the common mo&s;s &s;ide, a multitude following, the con&s;tables and other officers gave me &s;ome blows over my back with their willow rods, and thru&s;t me among the rude multitude; who, having furni&s;hed them&s;elves with &s;taves, hedge-&s;takes, holm or holly bu&s;hes, fell upon me, and beat me on my head, arms, and &s;houlders, till they had deprived me of &s;en&s;e; &s;o that I fell down upon the wet common. When I recovered again, and &s;aw my&s;elf lying in a watery common, and the people &s;tanding about me, I lay &s;till a little while, and the power of the Lord &s;prang through me, and the eternal refre&s;hings revived me; &s;o that I &s;tood up again in the &s;trengthening power of the eternal God, and &s;tretching out my arms among&s;t them, I &s;aid, with a loud voice, "Strike again; here are my arms, my head, and my cheeks." There was in the company a ma&s;on, a pro|fe&s;&s;or, but a rude fellow, who with his walking rule-&s;taff
<PB N="105" REF="037441_0182_100D7F67E6CA86D8">gave me a blow with all his might ju&s;t over the back of my hand, as it was &s;tretched out; with which blow my hand was &s;o brui&s;ed, and my arm &s;o benumbed. that I could not draw it to me again; &s;o that &s;ome of the people cried, <Q>He hath &s;poiled his hand for ever having the u&s;e of it any more.</Q> But I looked at it in the love of God (for I was in the love of God to all that per&s;ecuted me) and after awhile the Lord's power &s;prang through me again, and through my hand and arm, &s;o that in a moment I recovered &s;trength in my hand and arm in the &s;ight of them all. Then they began to fall out among them&s;elves: &s;ome of them came to me, and &s;aid, If I would give them money, they would &s;ecure me from the re&s;t. But I was moved of the Lord to declare the word of life, and &s;hewed them their fal&s;e chri&s;tianity, and the fruits of their prie&s;t's mi|ni&s;try; telling them, They were more like heathens and Jews, than true chri&s;tians. Then was I moved of the Lord to come up again through the mid&s;t of the people, and go into Ulver&s;tone market. As I went, there met me a &s;ol|dier, with his &s;word by his &s;ide; "Sir," &s;aid he to me," I <Q>&s;ee you are a man, and I am a&s;hamed and grieved that you &s;hould be thus abu&s;ed;</Q> and offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in what he could. I told him, The Lord's power was over all, and I walked through the people in the market, none of whom had power to touch me then. But &s;ome of the market people abu&s;ing &s;ome friends in the market, I turned about, and &s;aw this &s;oldier among them with his naked rapier; whereupon I ran, and, catching hold of the hand his rapier was in, bid him put up his &s;word again, if he would go along with me: for I was willing to draw him out from the company le&s;t &s;ome mi&s;chief &s;hould be done. A few days after, &s;even men fell upon this &s;oldier, and beat him cruelly, becau&s;e he had taken part with friends and me. It was the manner of the per&s;ecutors of that country, for twenty or forty people to run upon one man. They fell &s;o upon friends in many places, that they could hardly pa&s;s the highways, &s;toning, beating, and breaking their heads. When I came to Swarthmore, I found the friends there dre&s;&s;ing the heads and hands of friends and friendly people, which had been broken or hurt that day by the profe&s;&s;ors and hearers of Lampitt. My body and arms were yellow, black and blue, with the brui&s;es I received among&s;t them. Now began the prie&s;ts
<PB N="106" REF="037441_0183_100D8ED0EC166080">to prophe&s;y again, That within half a year we &s;hould be all put down and gone.</P>
<P>About two weeks after this, I went into Walney i&s;land, and James Nayler with me. We &s;taid one night at a little town on this &s;ide, called Cockan, and had a meeting there, where one was convinced. After awhile came a man with a pi&s;tol; whereupon the people ran out of doors. He cal|led for me; and when I came to him, he &s;napped his pi&s;|tol at me; but it would not go off. This cau&s;ed the peo|ple to make a great bu&s;tle about him; and &s;ome of them took hold of him, to prevent his doing mi&s;chief. But I was moved in the Lord's power to &s;peak to him; and he was &s;o &s;truck by divine power that he trembled for fear, and went and hid him&s;elf. Thus the Lord's power came over them all, though there was a great rage in the country.</P>
<P>Next morning I went in a boat to James Lanca&s;ler's. As &s;oon as I came to land, there ru&s;hed out about forty men, with &s;taves, clubs, and fi&s;hing-poles; who fell upon me, beating, punching me, and endeavouring to thru&s;t me backward into the &s;ea. When they had thru&s;t me almo&s;t into the &s;ea, and I &s;aw they would have knocked me down in it, I went up into the middle of them; but they laid at me again, knocked me down, and &s;tunned me. When I came to my&s;elf, I looked up and &s;aw James Lanca&s;ter's wife throwing &s;tones at my face, and her hu&s;band lying over me, to keep the blows and &s;tones from me. For the people had per&s;uaded James's wife that I had bewitched her hu&s;band; and had promi&s;ed her, That if &s;he would let them know when I came thither, they would be my death; and having got knowledge of my coming, many of the town ro&s;e up in this manner with clubs and &s;taves to kill me; but the Lord's power pre&s;erved me, that they could not take away my life. At length I got upon my feet, but they beat me down again into the boat; which James Lan|ca&s;ter ob&s;erving, he pre&s;ently came into the boat to me, and &s;et me over the water from them; but while we were on the water, within their reach, they &s;truck at us with long poles, and threw &s;tones after us. By that time we were come to the other &s;ide, we &s;aw them beating James Nayler: for whil&s;t they had been beating me, he walked into a field, and they never minded him till I was gone; then they fell upon him, and all their cry was <Q>Kill him, kill him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="037441_0184_100D8ED2D2AC74E0">
When I was come over to the town again, on the other &s;ide of the water, the town&s;men ro&s;e up with pitchforks, flails, and &s;taves, to keep me out of the town, crying, <Q>Kill him, knock him on the head; bring the cart, and carry him away to the church-yard.</Q> So after they had abu&s;ed me, they drove me a pretty way out of the town, and there left me. Then went James Lanca&s;ter again, to look after James Nayler; and I being now left alone, went to a ditch; and having wa&s;hed my&s;elf, walked about three miles to Thomas Hutton's, where lodged Thomas Law&s;on, the prie&s;t that was convinced. When I came in, I could hardly &s;peak to them, I was &s;o brui&s;ed; only I told them where I left James Nayler. Whereupon they took each of them a hor&s;e, and went and brought him thither that night. The next day Margaret Fell hearing of it, &s;ent an hor&s;e for me; but &s;o &s;ore I was with brui&s;es, that I was not able to bear the &s;haking of the hor&s;e without much pain. When I was come to Swarthmore, ju&s;tice Sawrey and ju&s;tice Thomp&s;on of Lanca&s;ter granted a warrant again&s;t me; but judge Fell coming home, it was not &s;erved upon me: for he was out of the country all this time that I was thus cruelly abu&s;ed. When he came home, he &s;ent warrants into the i&s;le of Walney, to apprehend all tho&s;e riotous per&s;ons; whereupon &s;ome of them &s;led the country. James Lanca&s;ter's wife was afterwards convinced of the truth, and repented of the evil &s;he had done me; and &s;o did &s;ome others of tho&s;e bitter per&s;ecutors al&s;o; but the judgments of God fell upon &s;ome, and de&s;truction is come upon many of them &s;ince. Judge Fell de&s;ired me to give him a relation of my per&s;ecution; but I told him, They could do no otherwi&s;e in the &s;pirit wherein they were; and that they manife&s;ted the fruits of their prie&s;t's mini&s;try, and their pro|fe&s;&s;ion and religion to be wrong. So he told his wife I made nothing of it; and that I &s;pake of it as a man that had not been concerned: for indeed the Lord's power heal|ed me again.</P>
<P>After I was recovered, I went to Yell and, where was a great meeting. In the evening came a prie&s;t to the hou&s;e, with a pi&s;tol in his hand, under pretence to light a pipe of tobacco. The maid of the hou&s;e &s;eeing the pi&s;tol, told her ma&s;ter: who thereupon, clapping his hands on both the door-po&s;ts, told him, He &s;hould not come in there. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e he &s;tood there, keeping the door way, he looked up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d &s;pied over the wall a company of men coming, &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ed

<P>The time for the &s;e&s;&s;ions at Lanca&s;ter being come, I went thither with judge Fell; who on the way told me, He never had &s;uch a matter brought before him, and could not well tell what to do in the bu&s;ine&s;s. I an&s;wered when Paul was brought before the rulers, and the Jews and prie&s;ts came down to accu&s;e him, and laid many fal&s;e things to his charge, Paul &s;tood &s;till all that while. When they had done, Fe&s;tus the governor and king Agrippa beckoned to him to &s;peak for him&s;elf; which Paul did, and cleared him|&s;elf of all tho&s;e accu&s;ations: &s;o he might do by me. Being come to Lanca&s;ter, and ju&s;tice Sawrey and ju&s;tice Thomp|&s;on having granted a warrant to apprehend me, though I was not apprehended by it, yet hearing of it, I appeared at the &s;e&s;&s;ions; where there appeared again&s;t me about forty prie&s;ts. The&s;e had cho&s;en one Mar&s;hal, a prie&s;t of Lan|ca&s;ter, to be their orator; and had provided one young prie&s;t and two prie&s;ts &s;ons to bear witne&s;s again&s;t me, who had &s;worn beforehand that I had &s;poken bla&s;phemy. When the ju&s;tices were &s;et, they heard all that the prie&s;ts and their witne&s;&s;es could &s;ay and charge again&s;t me; their orator Mar&s;hal &s;itting by, and explaining their &s;ayings for them; but the witne&s;&s;es were &s;o confounded, that they di&s;|covered them&s;elves to be fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es. For when the court had examined one of them upon oath, and then be|gan to examine another of them, he was at &s;uch a lo&s;s, he could not an&s;wer directly; but &s;aid. The other could &s;ay it. Which made the ju&s;tices &s;ay to him, <Q>Have you &s;worn it, and given it in already upon oath, and now &s;ay, that he can &s;ay it? It &s;eems, you did not hear tho&s;e words &s;po|ken your&s;elf, though you have &s;worn it?</Q></P>
<P>There were then in court &s;everal who had been at that meeting, wherein the witne&s;&s;es &s;wore I &s;poke tho&s;e bla&s;phe|mous words which the prie&s;ts accu&s;ed me of; and the&s;e, being men of integrity and reputation in the country, did declare and affirm in court, That the oath, which the witne&s;&s;es had taken again&s;t me, was altogether fal&s;e; and that no &s;uch words as they had &s;worn again&s;t me were &s;poken by me at that meeting. Indeed, mo&s;t of the &s;erious men of that &s;ide of the country, then at the &s;e&s;&s;ions, had been at that meet|ing and had heard me both at that and other meetings al&s;o. This was taken notice of by colonel We&s;t, who being a
<PB N="109" REF="037441_0186_100D8ED823216498">ju&s;tice of the peace, was then upon the bench; and having long been weak in body, ble&s;&s;ed the Lord, and &s;aid, The Lord had healed him that day; adding, That he never &s;aw &s;o many &s;ober people and good faces together in all his life. Then turning him&s;elf to me, he &s;aid in the open &s;e&s;&s;ions, <Q>George, if thou ha&s;t any thing to &s;ay to the people, thou maye&s;t freely declare it.</Q> I was moved of the Lord to &s;peak: and as &s;oon as I began, prie&s;t Mar&s;hal, the orator for the re&s;t of the prie&s;ts, went his way. That which I was moved to declare, was this: <Q>That the holy &s;criptures were given forth by the Spirit of God; and all people mu&s;t fir&s;t come to the Spirit of God in them&s;elves, by which they might know God and Chri&s;t, of whom the prophets and apo&s;tles learnt; and by the &s;ame Spirit know the holy &s;criptures; for as the Spirit of God was in them that gave forth the &s;criptures, &s;o the &s;ame Spirit mu&s;t be in all them that come to under&s;tand the &s;criptures. By which Spirit they might have fellow&s;hip with the Father, with the Son, with the &s;criptures, and with one another: and without this Spirit they can know neither God, Chri&s;t, nor the &s;criptures, nor have a right fellow&s;hip one with another.</Q> I had no &s;ooner &s;poken the&s;e words, but about half a dozen prie&s;ts, that &s;tood behind me, bur&s;t into a pa&s;&s;ion. One of them, who&s;e name was Jackus, among&s;t other things that he &s;pake again&s;t the truth, &s;aid, That the Spirit and the letter were in&s;eparable. I replied, <Q>Then every one that hath the letter, hath the Spirit; and they might buy the Spirit with the letter of the &s;criptures.</Q> This plain di&s;covery of darkne&s;s in the prie&s;t moved judge Fell and colonel We&s;t to reprove them openly, and tell them. That according to that po&s;ition, they might carry the Spirit in their pockets as they did the &s;criptures. Upon this, the prie&s;ts, being confounded and put to &s;ilence, ru&s;h|ed out in a rage again&s;t the ju&s;tices, becau&s;e they could not have their bloody ends upon me. The ju&s;tices, &s;eeing the witne&s;&s;es did not agree, and perceiving they were brought to an&s;wer the prie&s;ts envy, and finding that all their evi|dences were not &s;ufficient in law to make good their charge again&s;t me, di&s;charged me. And after judge Fell had &s;po|ken to ju&s;tice Sawrey and ju&s;tice Thomp&s;on concerning the warrant they had given forth again&s;t me, and &s;hewing them the errors thereof, he and colonel We&s;t granted a &s;uper|&s;edeas to &s;top the execution of it. Thus I was cleared in open &s;e&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e lying accu&s;ations which the malicious
<PB N="110" REF="037441_0187_100D8ED9B3FCDA68">prie&s;ts had laid to my charge: and multitudes of people prai&s;ed God that day, for it was a joyful day to many. Ju&s;tice Ben&s;on of We&s;tmoreland was convinced; and major Ripan, mayor of the town of Lanca&s;ter, al&s;o. It was a day of everla&s;ting &s;alvation to hundreds of people: for the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the way to the Father, the free Teacher, was exalted and &s;et up; his everla&s;ting go&s;pel was preach|ed, and the word of eternal life was declared over the heads of the prie&s;ts, and all &s;uch lucrative preachers. For the Lord opened many mouths that day to &s;peak his word to the prie&s;ts, and &s;everal friendly people and profe&s;&s;ors re|proved them in their inns, and in the &s;treets, &s;o that they fell, like an old rotten hou&s;e: and the cry was among the people, That the Quakers had got the day, and the prie&s;ts were fallen. Many were convinced that day, among&s;t whom Thomas Briggs was one, who before had been &s;o aver&s;e to friends and truth, that di&s;cour&s;ing with John Law&s;on, a friend, concerning perfection, Thomas &s;aid to him, "Do&s;t thou hold perfection?" and lift up his hand, to have given the friend a box on the ear. But Thomas, being convinced of the truth that day, declared again&s;t his own prie&s;t Jackus; and afterwards became a faithful mi|ni&s;ter of the go&s;pel, and &s;tood &s;o to the end of his days.</P>
<P>When the &s;e&s;&s;ions were over, James Nayler, who was pre&s;ent, gave a brief account of the proceedings thereof in a letter, which &s;oon after he wrote to friends, and is here added for the reader's further &s;atisfaction:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>DEAR friends and brethren in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, my dear love unto you all, de&s;iring you may be kept &s;teadfa&s;t in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and in the power of his love, boldly to witne&s;s forth the truth, as it is re|vealed in you by the mighty working of the Father: to him alone be everla&s;ting prai&s;e and honour for evermore! Dear friends, the Lord doth much manife&s;t his love and power in the&s;e parts. The &s;econd day of the la&s;t week my brother George and I were at Lanca&s;ter. There were abundance of friends from all parts; and a great many who &s;ided with the prie&s;ts, giving out, They now hoped to &s;ee a &s;top put to that great work which had gone on &s;o fa&s;t, and with &s;uch power, that their kingdom is much &s;haken. We were called before judge Fell, colonel We&s;t, ju&s;tice Sawrey, &amp;c. to an&s;wer what was charged again&s;t George. There were three witne&s;&s;es to eight particu|lars,
<PB N="111" REF="037441_0188_100D8EDB4E6201C0">but they were much confu&s;ed in them&s;elves; which gave much light to the truth: whereby the ju&s;tices did plainly &s;ee that it was envy; and they divers times told them &s;o. One of the witne&s;&s;es was a young prie&s;t, who confe&s;&s;ed, He had not meddled, had not another prie&s;t &s;ent for him, and &s;et him on work. The other witne&s;&s;es were two prie&s;ts &s;ons. It was proved there by many, that heard one of them &s;ay, If he had power, he would make George deny his profe&s;&s;ion, and that he would take away his life. This was a &s;ingle witne&s;s to one of the greate&s;t untruths charged again&s;t George. The ju&s;tices told him, They &s;aw, becau&s;e he could not take away his life, he went about to take away his liberty. There was one prie&s;t cho&s;en out of the whole number, as an orator, to plead again&s;t us; who &s;pared no pains to &s;hew his envy again&s;t the truth: and when he could not prevail, he went down in a rage; and there came a number of them into the room, among whom was one Jackus. George was then &s;peaking in the room (one of the judges having wi&s;hed, if he had any thing to &s;ay, that he would &s;peak:) at which prie&s;t Jackus was in &s;uch a rage, that he brake forth into many high expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the truth &s;poken by my dear brother George; among&s;t which this was one, That the letter and the Spirit were in&s;eparable. Hereupon the ju&s;tices &s;tood up, and bid him prove that, before he went any further. Then he &s;eeing him&s;elf caught, would have denied it; and when he could not get off &s;o, the re&s;t of the prie&s;ts would have helped him to a meaning for his words: but the ju&s;tices would admit no othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ning than the plain &s;en&s;e of the words, and told him, He had laid down a po&s;ition, and it was fit he &s;hould prove it; pre&s;&s;ing the matter clo&s;e upon him. Whereupon the prie&s;ts, be|ing put to &s;ilence, went down in a greater rage than before; and &s;ome of them, after they were gone down, being a&s;ked what they had done, lied, and &s;aid, They could not get into the room; thereby to hide their &s;hame, and keep the people in blindne&s;s. The ju&s;tices, judge Fell, and colonel We&s;t, were much convinced of the truth, and did &s;et up ju&s;tice and equity; and have much &s;ilenced the rage of the people. Many bitter &s;pirits were at Lanca&s;ter, to &s;ee the event; but went home, and cried, The prie&s;ts had lo&s;t the day. Everla&s;ting pral&s;es be to him who fought the battle for us, who is our King
<PB N="112" REF="037441_0189_100D8EDE9A61C8C0">for ever! There were others called, who the witne&s;&s;es confe&s;&s;ed were in the room when the things charged on George were &s;aid to have been &s;poken; but they all, as one man, denied that any &s;uch words were &s;poken: which gave much light to the ju&s;tices, and they dur&s;t rely on what they witne&s;&s;ed; for they &s;aid, they knew many of them to be hone&s;t men. There was a warrant granted again&s;t us at Appleby; but ju&s;tice Ben&s;on told them it was not according to law; and &s;o it cea&s;ed. I hear he is a faithful man to the truth. The prie&s;ts began to preach again&s;t the ju&s;tices, and &s;aid, They were not to meddle in the&s;e things, but to end controver&s;y betwixt neighbour and neighbour. They are not plea&s;ed with the law, be|cau&s;e it is not in the &s;tatute to impri&s;on us, as the prie&s;t that pleaded again&s;t us &s;aid. The ju&s;tices bid him go put it into the &s;tatute, if he could; he &s;aid, It &s;hould want no will of his. They are much afraid that they &s;hall lo&s;e all. They are much di&s;contented in the&s;e parts; and &s;ome of them cry, "All is gone." Dear friends, dwell in patience, and wait upon the Lord, who will do his own work. Look not at man, in the work; nor at man, who oppo&s;eth the work: but re&s;t in the will of the Lord, that &s;o ye may be furni&s;hed with patience both to do and to &s;uffer what ye &s;hall be called unto; that your end in all things may be his prai&s;e. Take up his cro&s;s freely, which keeps low the fle&s;hly man; that Chri&s;t may be &s;et up and honoured in all things, the light advanced in you, and the judgment &s;et up, which mu&s;t give &s;entence again&s;t all that oppo&s;eth the truth; that the captivity may be led captive, and the pri&s;oner &s;et free to &s;eek the Lord; that righteou&s;ne&s;s may rule in you, and peace and joy may dwell in you, wherein con&s;i&s;teth the kingdom of the Fa|ther; to whom be all prai&s;e for ever! Dear friends, meet often together; take heed of what exalteth it&s;elf above its brother; keep low, and &s;erve one another in love for the Lord's &s;ake. Let all friends know how it is with us, that God may have the prai&s;e of all.</P>

<P>At this time I was in a fa&s;t, and was not to eat until this work of God, which then lay weighty upon me, was ac|compli&s;hed. But the Lord's power was wonderfully exalt|ed, and he gave truth and friends dominion therein over
<PB N="113" REF="037441_0190_100D8EE1868C3D30">all. His glory was freely preached that day, over the heads of about forty hireling prie&s;ts. I &s;taid two or three days afterwards in Lanca&s;ter, and had &s;ome meetings there. The rude and ba&s;er &s;ort of people plotted together to have drawn me out of the hou&s;e, and to have thrown me over Lanca&s;ter bridge, but the Lord prevented them. Then they invented another mi&s;chief, which was this: After a meeting at Lanca&s;ter, they brought down a di&s;tracted man, and another with him, having bundles of birchen rods, bound together like be&s;oms, with which they &s;hould have whipped me; but I was moved to &s;peak to them in the Lord's mighty power, which chained down the di&s;tracted man, and the other al&s;o; and made them cahn and quiet. Then I bid him throw his rods into the fire, and burn them; which he did. Thus the Lord's power being over then, they departed quietly.</P>
<P>The prie&s;ts, fretting to &s;ee them&s;elves overthrown at the &s;e&s;&s;ions at Lanca&s;ter, got &s;ome of the envious ju&s;tices to join with them; and at the following a&s;&s;ize at Lanca&s;ter informed judge Windham again&s;t me. Whereupon the judge made a &s;peech again&s;t me in open court; and com|manded colonel We&s;t, who was clerk of the a&s;&s;ize, to i&s;&s;ue a warrant for the apprehending of me; but colonel We&s;t told the judge of my innocence, and &s;poke boldly in my defence. Yet the judge commanded him again, either to write a warrant, or go from his &s;eat. Then he told the judge plainly, that he would not do it; but that he would offer up all his e&s;tate, and his body al&s;o for me. Thus he &s;topped the judge, and the Lord's power came over all; &s;o that the prie&s;ts and ju&s;tices could not get their envy exe|cuted. The &s;ame night I came into Lanca&s;ter, it being the a&s;&s;ize-time: and hearing of a warrant to be given out again&s;t me, I judged it better to &s;hew my&s;elf openly, than for my adver&s;aries to &s;eek me. So I went to judge Fell's and colonel We&s;t's chambers. As &s;oon as I came in, they &s;miled on me; and colonel We&s;t &s;aid, <Q>What! are you come into the dragon's mouth?</Q> I &s;taid till the judge went out of town; and I walked up and down the town, but no one meddled with me, nor que&s;tioned me. Thus the Lord's ble&s;&s;ed power, which is over all, carried me through and over this exerci&s;e, gave dominion over his ene|mies, and enabled me to go on in his glorious work and &s;ervice for his great name's &s;ake. For though the bea&s;t
<PB N="114" REF="037441_0191_100D8EE318EFD9A0">maketh war again&s;t the &s;aints, yet the Lamb hath got and will get the victory.</P>
<P>From Lanca&s;ter I returned to Robert Withers's. From thence I went to Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mas Leper's, and a very ble&s;&s;ed meet|ing we had there; after which, I walked in the evening to Robert Withers's again. No &s;ooner was I gone, but there came a company of di&s;gui&s;ed men to Thomas Leper's, with &s;words and pi&s;tols; who &s;uddenly entering the hou&s;e, put out the candles, and &s;wung their &s;words about among&s;t the people of the hou&s;e, &s;o that they were fain to hold up the chairs before them, to &s;ave them&s;elves from being cut and wounded. At length they drove all the people out, and then &s;earched the hou&s;e for me, who it &s;eems was the only per&s;on they looked for. They had laid wait before in the highway, by which I &s;hould have gone if I had rid to Robert Withers's, and not meeting with me on the way, they thought to have found me in the hou&s;e, but the Lord prevented them. Soon after I came to Robert Withers's, &s;ome friends from the town where Thomas Leper lived gave us a relation of this wicked attempt; and were afraid le&s;t they &s;hould come and &s;earch Robert Withers's hou&s;e al&s;o for me, and do me a mi&s;chief; but the Lord re&s;trained them, that they came not. The&s;e men were in di&s;gui&s;e, yet friends perceived &s;ome of them were Frenchmen, and &s;uppo&s;ed them to be &s;ervants belonging to one called Sir Robert Bindlas: for &s;ome of them had &s;aid, in their na|tion they u&s;ed to tie the prote&s;tants to trees, and whip and de&s;troy them. His &s;ervants often abu&s;ed friends, both in, and going to and from their meetings. They once took Richard Hubberthorn and &s;erveral others out of the meet|ing, carried them a long way into the fields, bound them, and left them in the winter &s;ea&s;on. Another time one of his &s;ervants came to Francis Fleming's, and thru&s;t his naked rapier in at the door and windows; but a kin&s;|man of Francis Fleming's, not a friend, came with a cudgel, and bid the &s;ervant man put up his rapier; which when he would not, but vapoured at him with it, and was rude, he knocked him down, took his rapier from him, and, had it not been for friends, would have run him through with it. So friends pre&s;erved his life, that would have de&s;troyed theirs.</P>
<P>From Robert Withers's I went to vi&s;it ju&s;tice We&s;t, Richard Hubberthorn accompanying me. Not knowing the way, nor the danger of the &s;ands, we rode where, we
<PB N="115" REF="037441_0192_100D8EE5951B2ED8">were afterwards told, no man ever rode before, &s;wimming our hor&s;es over a very dangerous place. When we were come in, ju&s;tice We&s;t a&s;ked us, If we did not &s;ee two men riding over the &s;ands? "I &s;hall have their cloaths anon," &s;aid he, <Q>for they cannot e&s;cape drowning; and I am the coroner.</Q> But when we told him we were the men, he was a&s;toni&s;hed, and wondered how we e&s;caped drowning. Upon this the envious prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors rai&s;ed a &s;tan|derous report, That neither water could drown me, nor could they draw blood of me; and therefore I was a witch: indeed, &s;omtimes when they beat me with great &s;taves, they did not much draw my blood, though they brui&s;ed my body very &s;orely. But all the&s;e &s;landers were nothing to me with re&s;pect to my&s;elf; though I was concerned on the truth's behalf, which I &s;aw they endeavoared by the&s;e means to prejudice people again&s;t; for I con&s;idered that their forefathers, the apo&s;tate Jews, called the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e Beelzebub; and the&s;e apo&s;tate chri&s;tians from the life and power of God could do no le&s;s to his &s;eed. But the Lord's power carried me over their &s;landerous tongues, and their bloody murderous &s;pirits; who had the ground of witchcraft in them&s;elves, which kept them from coming to God and to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Having vi&s;ited ju&s;tice We&s;t, I went to Swarthmore, vi|&s;iting friends, and the Lord's power was over all the per|&s;ecutors there. I was moved to write letters to the magi&s;|trates, prie&s;ts, and profe&s;&s;ors thereabouts, who had rai&s;ed per&s;ecution before. That to ju&s;tice Sawrey was after this manner:</P>

How ha&s;t thou &s;hewed thy evil, that thou ha&s;t &s;erved God but with thy lips, and thy heart far from him, and thou in the hypocri&s;y!

One who&s;e fruit hath withered (of which I am a witne&s;s) and many who have known thy fruit have &s;een the end of it, that it is withered; and do &s;ee where thou art, in the blind world, a blind leader of the blind; as a bea&s;t wallowing and tumbling in the earth, and in the lu&s;t; one that is erred from the Spirit of the Lord, of old ordained to condemnation. Thou art in the &s;eat of the Phari&s;ees, art called of men ma&s;ter, &s;lande&s;t pray|ing in the &s;ynagogues, and ha&s;t the chief &s;eat in the a&s;&s;emblies; a right hypocrite in the &s;teps of the Phari|&s;ees, and in the way of thy fathers, the hypocrites, which our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t cried wo again&s;t. Such with the light thou art &s;een to be, and by the light art com|prehended; which is thy condemnation who hate&s;t it, and
<PB N="118" REF="037441_0195_100D8EEBF7DEEAE0">will be &s;o eternally except thou repent. To thee this is the word of God; for in Chri&s;t's way thou art not, but in that of the Phari&s;ees, as thou maye&s;t read, Mat. xxiii, All that own Chri&s;t's words may &s;ee thee there. Chri&s;t, who died at Jeru&s;alem, cried wo again&s;t &s;uch as thou art; and Chri&s;t is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and for ever. The wo remains upon thee, and from under it thou can&s;t never come, but through judgment, condemnation, and true repentance. To thee this is the word of God. To that of God in thy con&s;cience I &s;peak, which will witne&s;s the truth of what I write, and will condemn thee. When thou art in thy torment (though now thou &s;welle&s;t in thy vanity, and live&s;t in wickedne&s;s) remember thou wa&s;t warned in thy life-time. When the eternal condemnation is &s;tretched over thee, thou &s;halt witne&s;s this to be the word of the Lord God unto thee, and if ever thine eye &s;hould &s;ee repentance, thou wilt witne&s;s me to have been a friend of thy &s;ould.</P>

<P>Having thus cleared my con&s;cience to the ju&s;tice and the prie&s;t of Ulver&s;tone, it was upon me to &s;end this warn|ing in writing to the people of Ulver&s;tone in general.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>CONSIDER, O people! who are within the pari&s;h of Ulver&s;tone, I was moved of the Lord to come into your publick places to &s;peak among you, being &s;ent of God to direct your minds to him, that you might know where to &s;ind your teacher; that your minds might be &s;tayed alone upon God, and you might not gad abroad without you for a teacher; for the Lord alone will teach his people; he is coming to teach them, and to gather his people from idols temples, and from the cu&s;tomary wor|&s;hips which all the world is trained up in. God hath given to every one of you a mea&s;ure of his Spirit accord|ing to your capacity; liars, drunkards, whoremongers, and thieves, and who follow filthy plea&s;ures, you all have this mea&s;ure in you. This is the mea&s;ure of the Spirit of God that &s;hews you &s;in, evil, and deceit; which le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s you &s;ee lying is &s;in; theft, drunkenne&s;s, and uncleanne&s;s, to be the works of darkne&s;s. Therefore mind your mea|&s;ure (for nothing that is unclean &s;hall enter into the king|dom of God) and prize your time while you have it, le&s;t the time come that you will &s;ay, with &s;orrow, we had
<PB N="119" REF="037441_0196_100D8EED9857E348">time, but it is pa&s;t. Oh! why will ye die! Why will ye choo&s;e your own ways! Why will ye follow the cour&s;e of the world! Why will ye follow envy, malice, drunk|enne&s;s, and fooli&s;h plea&s;ures! Know ye not in your con|&s;ciences, that all the&s;e are evil and &s;in? and that &s;uch as act the&s;e things &s;hall never enter into the kingdom of God? Oh! that ye would con&s;ider and &s;ee how you have &s;pent your time, and mind how ye &s;pend your time, and ob&s;erve whom ye &s;erve; for the wages of &s;in is death. Do not ye know, that what&s;oever is more than yea and nay cometh of evil? Oh! ye drunkards, who live in drunkenne&s;s, do ye think to e&s;cape the fire, the judgment of God? Though ye &s;well in venom, and live in lu&s;t for awhile, yet God will find you out, and bring you to judgment. Therefore love the light which Chri&s;t hath enlightened you withal, who &s;aith, I am the light of the world, and who enlightens every one that cometh into the world. One loves the light, and brings his works to the light, and there is no occa&s;ion at all of &s;tumbling: the other hates the light, becau&s;e his deeds are evil, and the light will reprove him. Thou that hate&s;t this light thou ha&s;t it. Thou knowe&s;t, lying is evil, drunk|enne&s;s is evil, &s;wearing is evil, whoredom, the&s;t, all un|godline&s;s, and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, are evil. Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath given thee light enough to let thee &s;ee the&s;e are evil. This light, if thou love&s;t it, will teach thee holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, without which none &s;hall &s;ee God; but if thou hate&s;t this light, it is thy condemnation. Thus are Chri&s;t's words found to be true, and fulfilled among you. You that hate this light &s;et up hirelings and idols temples, and &s;uch prie&s;ts as bear rule by their means; &s;uch &s;hepherds as hold up &s;uch things, &s;uch as are called of men ma&s;ters and have the chiefe&s;t place in the a&s;&s;em|blies, whom Chri&s;t cried wo again&s;t, Mat. xxiii. &s;uch as go in the way of Cain, in envy, and after the error of Balaam for wages, gifts, and rewards, the&s;e have been your teachers, and the&s;e you have held up. But tho&s;e who love the light are taught of God, and the Lord is coming to teach his people him&s;elf, and to gather his from the hirelings, from &s;uch as &s;eek for their gain from their quarter, and from &s;uch as bear rule by their means. The Lord is opening the eyes of people, that they &s;hall &s;ee &s;uch as bear rule over them. But all, who&s;e eyes are &s;hut, are &s;uch as the prophet &s;poke of <Q>That have eyes, and
<PB N="120" REF="037441_0197_100D8EF0A28A6840">&s;ee not; but are fooli&s;h, upholding &s;uch things.</Q> There|fore, poor people, as ye love your own &s;ouls, con&s;ider the love of God to your &s;ouls while ye have time, and do not turn the grace of God into wantonne&s;s. That which &s;hews you ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts &s;hould and would be your teacher, if you would hearken to it; for the &s;aints of old witne&s;&s;ed the grace of God to be their teacher, which taught them to live &s;oberly and godly in this pre&s;ent world. You that are not &s;ober, this grace of God hath appeared unto you; but you turn it into want|tonne&s;s, and &s;et up teachers without you, who are not &s;ober, not holy, not godly. Here you are left without excu&s;e, when the righteous judgment of God &s;hall be re|vealed upon all who live ungodlily. Therefore to the light in you I &s;peak; and when the book of con&s;cience &s;hall come to be opened, then &s;hall you witne&s;s what I &s;ay to be true, and you all &s;hall be judged out of it. God Almighty direct your minds (&s;uch of you e&s;pecially as love hone&s;ty and &s;incerity) that you may receive mercy in the time of need. Your teacher is within you; look not forth: it will teach you both lying in bed, and going abroad, to &s;hun all occa&s;ion of &s;in and evil.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE word of the Lord God to all the people that follow prie&s;t Lampitt, who is a blind guide. Ye are &s;uch as are turned from the light of Chri&s;t within, which he hath enlightened you withal: ye are &s;uch as follow that which Chri&s;t cried wo again&s;t, that go not in Chri&s;t's way, but in the Phari&s;ees way, as ye may read, Mat. xxiii. which our Lord cried wo again&s;t. He is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and for ever; but him ye own not while ye follow &s;uch as he cried wo again&s;t, though ye make a profe&s;&s;ion, and Lampitt, your prie&s;t, makes a trade of Chri&s;t's and the &s;aints words, as his fathers, the Phari&s;ees, made a profe&s;&s;ion of the prophets and of Mo|&s;es's words. Wo was unto them who had not the life, &s;o wo is unto you who have not the life that gave forth the &s;criptures, as your fruits have made manife&s;t. For
<PB N="121" REF="037441_0198_100D8EF2C0AC2650">when the Lord moved &s;ome to come among&s;t you, to preach the truth freely, you knock'd them down, beat, punched, and haled them out of your a&s;&s;emblies. Such a people &s;erves thee, O Lampitt, to make a prey upon, and the&s;e are thy fruits. Oh! let &s;hame, &s;hame &s;trike thee and you all in the faces, who make a profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t's words, yet are &s;toners, &s;trikers, mockers, and &s;coffers. Let all &s;ee, if this be not a cage of unclean birds, which they who had the life of the &s;criptures &s;poke of. Such a company of people thou deceive&s;t, feede&s;t them with thy fancies, make&s;t a trade of the &s;criptures, and take&s;t them for thy cloak. But thou art manife&s;t to all the children of light, for that cloak will not cover thee, thy &s;kirts are &s;een and thy nakedne&s;s appears. The Lord made one to go naked among you, a figure of thy naked|ne&s;s, and of your nakedne&s;s, and as a &s;ign among&s;t you, before your de&s;truction cometh; that you might &s;ee you were naked and not covered with the truth. To the light in all your con&s;ciences I &s;peak, which Chri&s;t Je&s;us doth enlighten you withal. It will &s;hew you the time you have &s;pent, and all the evil you have done in that time, who follow &s;uch a teacher, that acts contrary to this light, and leads you into the ditch. When you are in the ditch together, both teacher and people, remember ye were warned in your life-time. If ever your eye come to &s;ee repentance, and you obey the light of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in you, you will witne&s;s me to have been a friend of your &s;ouls, and that I have &s;ought your eternal good, and written this in dear love to you. Then will you own your con|demnation; which you mu&s;t all own before you can come into that ble&s;&s;ed life, of which there is no end. But ye, who hate the light, becau&s;e your deeds are evil, this light is your condemnation. Oh! that ye would love this light and hearken to it! It would teach you, as you walk up and down about your occa&s;ions, and as you lie upon your beds, and would never let you &s;peak a vain word. In loving it, you love Chri&s;t; in hating it, you bring the condemnation thereof upon your&s;elves. To you this is the word of God, from under which you can never pa&s;s, not ever e&s;cape the terror of the Lord in the &s;tate you are in, who hate the light.</P>

<P>THE word of the Lord to thee, prie&s;t Tatharn, who art found out of the doctrine of Chri&s;t; having the chiefe&s;t place in the a&s;&s;embly, being called of men ma&s;ter, and &s;tanding praying in the &s;ynagogue in the &s;teps of the Phari&s;ees, which our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t cried wo again&s;t. In his way thou art not, but in the way of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees; as thou maye&s;t read, Matth. xxiii. There Chri&s;t's words judge thee, and the &s;criptures of truth con|demn thee. For thou art &s;uch a one as &s;ues men at law for tithes, yet profe&s;&s;e&s;t thy&s;elf to be a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t; which Chri&s;t never empowered his to do: neither did any of his apo&s;tles or mini&s;ters ever do &s;o.

To that of God in thy con&s;cience I &s;peak, which will witne&s;s the truth of what I &s;ay. Thou art one that goe&s;t in Cain's way, in envy, an enemy to God, and from the command of God. Thou art one that goe&s;t in Balaam's way, from the Spirit of God. for gifts and rewards, the wages of unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s. Thou &s;on of Balaam, thou art wor&s;e than thy fa|ther: for though he loved the wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, yet he dur&s;t not take it; but thou not only take&s;t it, but &s;ue&s;t men at law if they will not give it thee: which no true mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t ever did. Therefore &s;top thy mouth for ever, and make no mention of them, nor profe&s;s thy&s;elf one of them. With the light thou art &s;een and comprehended; who art light and vain, and &s;peake&s;t a divination of thy own brain, and deceive&s;t the people. That in thy con&s;cience will witne&s;s what I &s;ay, and will condemn thee, who art one of tho&s;e that bear rule by their means, which the Lord &s;ent Jeremiah to cry again&s;t, Jer. v. and &s;o thou holde&s;t up the <Q>horrible and filthy thing, that is committed in the land.</Q> They that do not tremble at the word of the Lord are the fooli&s;h peo|ple that hold thee up, they are &s;otti&s;h children without under&s;tanding.

Thou art one of tho&s;e that &s;eek their gain from their quarter; a greedy dumb dog that never hath enough, as thy practice makes manife&s;t; &s;uch the Lord &s;ent I&s;aiah to cry again&s;t, I&s;a. lvi. 11, 12.

<P>I wrote al&s;o to&mdash;Burton, prie&s;t of Sedberg, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, he being in the &s;ame evil ground, nature, and practice. Many other epi&s;tles al&s;o and papers I wrote about that time, as the Lord moved me thereunto, which I &s;ent among the prie&s;ts, profe&s;&s;ors, and people of all &s;orts, for the laying their evil ways open before them, that they might &s;ee and for&s;ake them; and opening the way of truth unto them, that they might come to walk therein; which are too many and large to be in&s;erted in this place.</P>
<P>After I had cleared my con&s;cience to the prie&s;ts and peo|ple near Swarthmore, I went again into We&s;tmoreland. A company of men with pikes and &s;laves laid wait for me at a bridge a the way; and they met with &s;ome friends, but mi&s;&s;ed me. Afterwards they came to the meeting with their pikes and &s;taves; but ju&s;tice Ben&s;on being there, and many con&s;iderable people be&s;ides, they were prevented from doing that mi&s;chief they intended. So they went away in a great rage, without hurting any body.</P>
<P>I went from the meeting to Grayrigg, and held a meet|ing at Alexander Dick&s;on's; to which the prie&s;t, who was a bapti&s;t and a chapel-prie&s;t, came to oppo&s;e but the Lord confounded him by his power. Some of the people tumbled down &s;ome milk-pails which &s;tood upon the &s;ide of the hou&s;e (which was much crowded) whereupon the prie&s;t, after he and his company were gone, rai&s;ed a &s;lan|der, <Q>That the devil frighted him, and took away a &s;ide of the hou&s;e, while he was in the meeting.</Q> And though this was a known fal&s;ehood, yet it &s;erved the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors to feed on for awhile; and &s;o &s;hamele&s;s they were, that they printed and publi&s;hed it.</P>
<P>Another time this prie&s;t came to a meeting, and fell to jangling. Fir&s;t he &s;aid, <Q>The &s;criptures were the word of God.</Q> I told him, they were the words of God, but not
<PB N="125" REF="037441_0202_100D8EFC3A6C0248">Chri&s;t, the Word; and bid him prove by &s;cripture what he &s;aid. Then he &s;aid, it was not the &s;cripture that was the word; and &s;etting his foot upon the bible, &s;aid, it was but copies bound up together. Many un&s;avory words came from him, but after he was gone we had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting; the Lord's power and pre&s;ence was preciou&s;ly mainfe&s;ted and felt among us. Soon after he &s;ent me a challenge to meet him at Kendal. I &s;ent him word he need not go &s;o far as Kendal, for I would meet him in his own pari&s;h. The hour being fixed, we met, and abundance of rude peo|ple gathered together (be&s;ides the baptized people who were his own members) with intent to do mi&s;chief, but God prevented-them. I declared the day of the Lord to them, and directed them to Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Then the prie&s;t out with his bible, and &s;aid, It was the word of God. I told him it was the words of God, but not God the Word. His an&s;wer was, He would prove the &s;criptures to be the word before all the people. I let him go on, having a man there that could take down in writing both what he and I &s;aid. When he could not prove it (for I kept him to &s;cripture-proof, chapter and ver&s;e for it) the people gna&s;hed their teeth for anger, and &s;aid, He would have me anon: but in going about to prove that one error, he ran into many. And when at length he &s;aw he could not prove it, he &s;aid, he would prove it a God: &s;o he toiled him&s;elf afre&s;h, till he &s;weat again; but could not prove what he had affirmed. And he and his company were full of wrath: for I kept his a&s;&s;ertions on the head of him and them all; and told them, I owned what the &s;criptures &s;aid of them|&s;elves, namely, that they were the words of God, but Chri&s;t was the Word. So the Lord's power came over all, and they being confounded went away. The Lord di&s;appoint|ed their mi&s;chievous intentions again&s;t me; friends were e&s;tabli&s;hed in Chri&s;t, and many of the prie&s;t's followers &s;aw the folly of their teacher.</P>
<P>After this, prie&s;t Bennet, of Cartmel, &s;ent a challenge to di&s;pute with me. I came to his &s;teeple-hou&s;e on a fir&s;t-day, and found him preaching. When he had done, I &s;poke to him and his people; yet the prie&s;t would not &s;tand the trial, but went his way. After he was gone, I had a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e with the people: and when I was come into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e yard, di&s;cour&s;ing further with the profe&s;&s;ors and declaring truth unto them, one of them &s;et his foot behind me, and two of them ran again&s;t
<PB N="126" REF="037441_0203_100D8EFDD0A82900">my brea&s;t, and threw me down backwards again&s;t a grave|&s;tone, wickedly and maliciou&s;ly &s;eeking to have hurt me: but I got up again, and was moved of the Lord to &s;peak to them. Then I went to the prie&s;t's hou&s;e, and de&s;ired him to come forth that I might di&s;cour&s;e with him, &s;eeing he had challenged me; but he would not be &s;een. So the Lord's power came over them all, which was greatly mani|fe&s;t at that time. There was among&s;t the prie&s;t's hearers one Richard Roper, one of the bittere&s;t profe&s;&s;ors the prie&s;t had, who was very fierce and hot in contention; but after|wards he came to be convinced of God's eternal truth, be|came a mini&s;ter thereof, and continued faithful to his death.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the year 1653 I returned to Swarthmore, and going to a meeting at Glea&s;ton, a profe&s;|&s;or challenged a di&s;pute with me. I went to the hou&s;e where he was, and called him to come forth; but the Lord's power was over him, &s;o that he dur&s;t not meddle. I departed thence, vi&s;ited the meetings of friends in Lanca|&s;hire, and came back to Swarthmore. Great openings I had from the Lord, not only of divine and &s;piritual matters, but al&s;o of outward things relating to the civil government. Being one day in Swarthmore-hall, when judge Fell and ju&s;tice Ben&s;on were talking of the news, and of the parlia|ment then &s;itting (called the long parliament) I was moved to tell them, Before that day two weeks the parliament &s;hould be broken up and the &s;peaker plucked out of his chair; and that day two weeks ju&s;tice Ben&s;on told judge Fell, that now he &s;aw George was a true prophet; for Oli|ver had broken up the parliament.</P>
<P>About this time I was in a fa&s;t for about ten days, my &s;pirit being greatly exerci&s;ed on truth's behalf: for James Milner and Richard Myer went out into imaginations, and a company followed them. This James Milner and &s;ome of his company had true openings at the fir&s;t; but getting up into pride and exaltation of &s;pirit, they ran out from truth. I was &s;ent for to them, and was moved of the Lord to go and &s;hew them their out-goings: and they were brought to &s;ee their folly, and condemned it, and came in|to the way of truth again. After &s;ome time I went to a meeting at Arn&s;ide, where Richard Myer was, who had been long lame of one of his arms. I was moved of the Lord to &s;ay unto him among&s;t all the people, <Q>Stand up upon thy legs,</Q> for he was &s;itting down; and he &s;tood up, and &s;tretched out his arm that had been lame a long
<PB N="127" REF="037441_0204_100D8F0080579DB0">time, and &s;aid, <Q>Be it known unto you, all people, that this day I am healed.</Q> Yet his parents could hardly be|lieve it; but after the meeting was done, had him a&s;ide, took off his doublet, and then &s;aw it was true. He came &s;oon after to Swarthmore meeting, and there declared how the Lord had healed him. Yet after this the Lord com|manded him to go to York with a me&s;&s;age from him; which he di&s;obeyed, and the Lord &s;truck him again, &s;o that he died about three quarters of a year after.</P>
<P>Now were great threatenings given forth in Cumberland, That if ever I came there, they would take away my life. When I heard it. I was drawn to go into Cumberland; and went to Miles Wennington's, in the &s;ame pari&s;h from which tho&s;e threatenings came: but they had not power to touch me.</P>
<P>About this time Anthony Pear&s;on was convinced, who had been an oppo&s;er of friends. He came to Swarthmore; and I being then at colonel We&s;t's, they &s;ent for me. Co|lonel We&s;t &s;aid, <Q>Go, George, for it may be of great &s;er|vice to the man.</Q> So I went, and the Lord's power reached him.</P>
<P>About this time al&s;o the Lord opened &s;everal mounths to declare the truth to prie&s;ts and people, and divers were ca&s;t into pri&s;on. I went again into Cumberland; and Antho|ny Pear&s;on and his wife, and &s;everal friends, went along with me to Bootle, where Anthony left me, and went to Carli&s;le &s;e&s;&s;ions: for he was a ju&s;tice of the peace in three counties. Upon the fir&s;t-day I went into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e at Bootle; and when the prie&s;t had done, I began to &s;peak. The people were exceeding rude, and beat me in the &s;teeple-hou&s;e yard. One gave me a very great blow over my wri&s;t, &s;o that the people thought he had broken my hand to pieces. The con&s;table was very willing to have kept the peace, and would have &s;et &s;ome of tho&s;e by the heals that &s;truck me, if I would have given way to it. After my &s;ervice among&s;t them was over, I went to Jo&s;eph Nichol&s;on's, and the con&s;table accompanied us, to keep off the rude multitude. In the afternoon I went up again; and then the prie&s;t had got another prie&s;t to help him, that came from London, who was highly accounted of. Before I went into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, I &s;at a little upon the cro&s;s, and friends with me; but they were moved to go into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and I went in after them. The London prie&s;t was preaching, who gathered up all the &s;criptures he
<PB N="128" REF="037441_0205_100D8F02A2AF5948">could think of, that &s;pake of fal&s;e prophets, antichri&s;ts, and deceivers, and threw them upon us. When he had done, I recollected all tho&s;e &s;criptures, and brought them back upon him&s;elf. Then the people fell upon me in a rude manner; but the con&s;table charged them to keep the peace, and made them quiet again. Then the prie&s;t began to rage; and &s;aid, I mu&s;t not &s;peak there. I told him, He had his hour-gla&s;s, by which he had preached; and he having done, the time was free for me, as well as for him: for he was but a &s;tranger there him&s;elf. So I opened the &s;criptures to them, and let them &s;ee, <Q>That tho&s;e &s;criptures, which &s;pake of the fal&s;e prophets, antichri&s;ts, and deceivers, de&s;cribed them and their generation, and belonged to them who were found walking in their &s;leps, and bringing forth their fruits; and not unto us, who were not guilty of &s;uch things.</Q> I manife&s;ted to them, that they were out of the &s;teps of the true prophets and apo&s;tles; and &s;hewed them clearly, by the fruits and marks, that they, and not we, were &s;uch as tho&s;e &s;criptures &s;poke of. And I declared the truth and the word of life to the people, and directed them to Chri&s;t their teacher. All was quiet while I was &s;peak|ing; but when I had done, and was come forth; the prie&s;ts were in &s;uch a fret and rage, that they foamed at the mouth for anger again&s;t me. The prie&s;t of the place made an ora|tion to the people in the &s;teeple-hou&s;e yard, &s;aying, <Q>This man hath gotten all the hone&s;t men and women in Lan|ca&s;hire to him, and now he come here to do the &s;ame.</Q> Then &s;aid I to him, <Q>What wilt thou have left? And what have the prie&s;ts left them, but &s;uch as them&s;elves? For if they be the hone&s;t that receive the truth and are turned to Chri&s;t, then they mu&s;t be the di&s;hone&s;t that follow thee, and &s;uch as thou art.</Q> Some al&s;o of the prie&s;t's people began to plead for their prie&s;t, and for tythes. I told them, It were better for them to plead for Chri&s;t, who had ended the tything prie&s;thood with the tythes, and had &s;ent forth his mini&s;ters to give freely, as they had received freely. So the rude people, that they could not do the mi&s;chief they intended. When I came down again to Jo&s;eph Nichol|&s;on's hou&s;e, I &s;aw a great hole in my coat, which was cut with a knife, but it was not cut through my wai&s;tcoat for the Lord had prevented their mi&s;chief. The next day there was a rude wicked man would have done violence to a friend, but the Lord's power &s;topped him.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="037441_0206_100D8F055893FA18">
Now was I moved to &s;end James Lanca&s;ter to appoint a meeting at John Wilkin&s;on's &s;teeple-hou&s;e near Cocker|mouth; a preacher in great repute, who had three pari&s;hes under him; wherefore I &s;taid at Milholm in Bootle till he came back again. In the mean time &s;ome of the gentry of the country had formed a plot again&s;t me, and had given a little boy a rapier to do me a mi&s;chief with. They came with the boy to Jo&s;eph Nichol&s;on's to &s;eek me; but the Lord had &s;o ordered it, I was gone into the fields. They met with James Lanca&s;ter, but did not much abu&s;e him; and not finding me in the hou&s;e, went away again. So I walked up and down in the fields that night, and did not go to bed as very often I u&s;ed to do. We came the next day to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, where James Lanca&s;ter had ap|pointed the meeting. There were at this meeting twelve &s;oldiers and their wives, from Carli&s;le; and the country people came in, like as it had been to a fair. I lay at an hou&s;e &s;omewhat &s;hort of the place, &s;o that many friends were got thither before me. When I came, I found James Lanca&s;ter &s;peaking under a yew-tree; which was &s;o full of people, I feared they would break it down. I looked about for a place to &s;tand upon, to &s;peak unto the people: for they lay all up and down, like people at a leaguer. After I was di&s;covered, a profe&s;&s;or a&s;ked, If I would not go into the church? I &s;eeing no place abroad convenient to &s;peak to the people from, told him, Yes: whereupon the people ru&s;hed in; &s;o that when I came, the hou&s;e and pulpit was &s;o full, I had much ado to get in. Tho&s;e that could not get in, &s;tood abroad about the walls. When the people were &s;ettled, I &s;tood up on a &s;eat. <Q>And the Lord opened my mouth to declare his everla&s;ting truth and his ever|la&s;ting day; and to lay open their teachers, with the rudi|ments, traditions, and inventions they had been under in the night of apo&s;tacy &s;ince the apo&s;tles days. I turned them to Chri&s;t the true teacher, and to the true &s;piritual wor&s;hip; directing them where to find the Spirit and truth, that they might wor&s;hip God therein. I explained Chri&s;t's parables unto them, and directed them to the Spirit of God in them&s;elves, that would open the &s;crip|tures unto them. I &s;hewed them, how all might come to know their Saviour, fit under his teaching, come to be heirs of the kingdom of God, and know God's and Chri&s;t's voice, by which they might di&s;cover all the fal&s;e &s;hep|herds and teachers they had been under, and be gathered
<PB N="130" REF="037441_0207_100D8F06EECF1010">to the true Shepherd, Prie&s;t, Bi&s;hop, and Prophet Chri&s;t Je&s;us, whom God commanded all to hear.</Q></P>
<P>When I had largely declared the word of life unto them for about the &s;pace of three hours, I walked from among&s;t the people, who pa&s;&s;ed away well &s;atisfied. Among the re&s;t a profe&s;&s;or followed me, prai&s;ing and commending me; but his words were like a thi&s;tle to me. At la&s;t I turned about, and bid him 'Fear the Lord;' whereupon prie&s;t Larkham of Cockermouth (for &s;everal prie&s;ts were got to|gether on the way, who came after the meeting was done) &s;aid to me, <Q>Sir, why do you judge &s;o? you mu&s;t not judge.</Q> I turned to him, and &s;aid, <Q>Friend, do&s;t thou not di&s;cern an exhortation from a judgment? I admo|ni&s;hed him to fear God; and do&s;t thou &s;ay I judge him?</Q> So this prie&s;t and I falling into di&s;cour&s;e, I mani|fe&s;ted him to be among&s;t the fal&s;e prophets and covetous hirelings; and &s;everal being moved to &s;peak to them, he and two other of the prie&s;ts &s;oon got away. When they were gone, John Wilkin&s;on, preacher of that pari&s;h, and of two other pari&s;hes in Cumberland, began to di&s;pute again&s;t his own con&s;cience for &s;everal hours, till the people generally turned again&s;t him: for he thought to have tired me out; but the Lord's power tired him out, and the Lord's truth came over him and them all. Many hundreds were convinced that day, who received the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his free teaching with gladne&s;s; of whom &s;ome have died in the truth, and many &s;tand faithful witne&s;&s;es thereof. The &s;oldiers al&s;o were convinced and their wives, and continued with me till fir&s;t-day.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t-day I went to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e at Cockermouth, where prie&s;t Larkham lived. When he had done, I began to &s;peak, and the people began to be rude; but the &s;oldi|ers told them, we had broken no law, and they became quiet. Then I turned to the prie&s;t, and laid him open among the fal&s;e prophets and hirelings; at which word he went his way, &s;aying, 'He calls me hireling;' which was true; all the people knew it. 'Some great men of the town &s;aid,' 'Sir, we have no learned men to di&s;pute with you.' I told them, I came not to di&s;pute, but to &s;hew the way of &s;alvation to them, the way of everla&s;ting life. I decla|red largely the way of life and truth to them, and directed them to Chri&s;t their teacher, who died for them, and bought them with his blood.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="037441_0208_100D8F08873F7030">
When I had done, I went about two miles to another great &s;teeple-hou&s;e of John Wilkin&s;on's, called Brigham; where the people, having been at the other meeting, were mightily affected, and would have put my hor&s;e into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e yard: but I &s;aid, <Q>No; the prie&s;t claims that; have him to an inn.</Q> When I came into the &s;tee|ple-hou&s;e yard, I &s;aw the people coming in great compa|nies, as to a fair; and abundance were already gathered in the lanes and about the &s;teeple-hou&s;e. I was very thir&s;ty, and walked about a quarter of a mile to a brook, where I got &s;ome water, and refre&s;hed my&s;elf. As I came up again, I met Wi&s;kin&s;on; who, as I pa&s;&s;ed by him, &s;aid, 'Sir, will you preach to-day? If you will,' &s;aid he, <Q>I will not oppo&s;e you in word or thought.</Q> I replied, <Q>Oppo&s;e, if thou wilt; I have &s;omething to &s;peak to the people. And,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>thou carried&s;t thy&s;elf fooli&s;hly the other day, and &s;pake&s;t again&s;t thy con&s;cience and rea&s;on, in&s;o|much, that thy hearers cried out again&s;t thee.</Q> So I left him, and went on; for he &s;aw it was in vain to oppo&s;e, the people were &s;o affected with the Lord's truth. When I came into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e yard, a profe&s;&s;or a&s;ked, If I would not go into the church? And I &s;eeing no convenient place abroad, went in; and &s;tood up on a &s;eat, after the people were &s;ettled. The prie&s;t came in al&s;o, but did not go up to his pulpit. <Q>The Lord opened my mouth, and I declared his everla&s;ting truth and word of life to the people; directing them to the Spirit of God in them&s;elves, by which they might know God, Chri&s;t, and the &s;crip|tures, and come to have heavenly fellow&s;hip in the Spirit. I declared to them, that every one that cometh into the world was enlightened by Chri&s;t the life; by which light they might &s;ee their &s;ins, and Chri&s;t, who was come to &s;ave them from their &s;ins, and died for them. And if they came to walk in this light, they might therein &s;ee Chri&s;t to be the author of their faith, and the fini&s;her thereof; their Shepherd to feed them, their Prie&s;t to teach them, their great Prophet to open divine my&s;teries unto them, and to be always pre&s;ent with them. I explained al&s;o to them, in the openings of the Lord, the fir&s;t convenant, &s;hewing them the figures, and the &s;ub&s;tance of tho&s;e figures; bringing them on to Chri&s;t, the new covenant. I al&s;o manife&s;ted to them, that there had been a night of apo&s;tacy &s;ince the apo&s;tles days; but that now the ever|la&s;ting go&s;pel was preached again, which brought life and
<PB N="132" REF="037441_0209_100D8F0BF03C28E8">immortality to light; and the day of the Lord was come, and Chri&s;t was come to teach his people him&s;elf by his light, grace, power, and &s;pirit.</Q> A fine opportunity the Lord gave me to preach truth that day for about three hours, and all was quiet. Many hundreds were convinced; and &s;ome of them prai&s;ed God, and &s;aid, <Q>Now we know the fir&s;t &s;tep to peace.</Q> The preacher al&s;o &s;aid privately to &s;ome of his hearers, that I had broken them, and over|thrown them.</P>
<P>After this I went to a village, and many people accom|panied me. As I was &s;itting in an hou&s;e full of people, declaring the word of life unto them, I ca&s;t mine eye upon a woman, and di&s;cerned an unclean &s;pirit in her. I was moved of the Lord to &s;peak &s;harply to her; and told her, &s;he was under the influence of an unclean &s;pirit. Where|upon the woman went out of the room. I being a &s;tranger there, and knowing nothing of the woman outwardly, the people wondered, and told me afterwards, I had di&s;covered a great thing: for all the country looked upon her to be a wicked per&s;on. The Lord had given me a Spirit of di&s;|cerning, by which I many times &s;aw the &s;tates and condi|tions of people, and could try their &s;pirits. Not long be|fore, as I was going to a meeting, I &s;aw &s;ome women in a field, and di&s;cerned an evil &s;pirit in them; and I was mov|ed to go out of my way into the field to them, and declare unto them their conditions. Another time there came one into Swarthmore hall in the meeting-time, and I was mov|ed to &s;peak &s;harply to her, and told her &s;he was under the power of an evil &s;pirit; and the people &s;aid afterwards, &s;he was generally accounted &s;o to be. There came al&s;o another time a woman, and &s;tood at a di&s;tance from me. I ca&s;t mine eye upon her, and &s;aid, 'Thou ha&s;t been an harlot:' for I perfectly &s;aw the condition and life of the woman. She an&s;wered, Many could tell her of her outward &s;ins, but none could tell her of her inward. I told her, Her heart was not right before the Lord; and that from the in|ward came the outward. This woman was afterwards con|vinced of God's truth, and became a friend.</P>
<P>From the afore&s;aid village we came to Thomas Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ley's, near Coldbeck; and from thence, having had &s;ome &s;ervice for the Lord there, I pa&s;&s;ed to a market-town, where I had a meeting at the cro&s;s; and all was pretty quiet. When I had declared the truth unto them, and directed them to Chri&s;t their teacher, &s;ome received the truth. We had
<PB N="133" REF="037441_0210_100D8F0D9A8379C0">another meeting upon the borders, in a &s;teeple-hou&s;e yard, to which many profe&s;&s;ors and contenders came; but the Lord's power was over all; and when the word of life had been declared among&s;t them, &s;ome received the truth there al&s;o.</P>
<P>From thence we travelled to Carli&s;le, and the pa&s;tor of the bapti&s;ts, with mo&s;t of his hearers, came to the abbey, where I had a meeting, and declared the word of life among&s;t them. Many of the bapti&s;ts and of the &s;oldiers were convinced. After the meeting, the pa&s;tor of the bap|ti&s;ts, an high notioni&s;t, and a fla&s;hy man, a&s;ked me, <Q>What mu&s;t be damned?</Q> I was moved immediately to tell him, 'That which &s;poke in him was to be damned.' This &s;top|ped his mouth; and the witne&s;s of God was rai&s;ed up in him. I opened to him the &s;tates of election and reproba|tion; &s;o that he &s;aid, He never heard the like in his life. He came afterwards to be convinced.</P>
<P>Then I went to the ca&s;tle among the &s;oldiers; who beat a drum, and called the garri&s;on together. I preached the truth among&s;t them, <Q>directing them to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be their teacher, and to the mea&s;ure of his Spirit in them&s;elves, by which they might be turned from dark|ne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God. I warned them all, that they &s;hould do no violence to any man, but &s;hould &s;hew forth a chri&s;tian life: telling them, that be who was to be their teacher, would be their con|demner, if they were di&s;obedient to him.</Q> So I left them, having no oppo&s;ition from any of them, except the &s;er|jeants, who afterwards came to be convinced.</P>
<P>On the market-day I went to the cro&s;s. The magi&s;trates had both threatened, and &s;ent their &s;erjeants; and the ma|gi&s;trates wives had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> If I came there, they would pluck the hair off my head; and the &s;erjeants &s;hould take me up. Neverthele&s;s I obeyed the Lord God, went upon the cro&s;s, and declared unto them, <Q>That the day of the Lord was coming upon all their deceitful ways and doings, and de|ceitful merchandize; that they &s;hould put away all cozen|ing and cheating, and keep to Yea and Nay, and &s;peak the truth one to another: &s;o the truth and the power of God was &s;et over them.</Q> After I had declared the word of life to the people, the throng being &s;o great that the &s;erjeants could not reach me, nor the magi&s;trates wives come at me, I pa&s;&s;ed away quietly. Many people and &s;oldiers came to me, and &s;ome bapti&s;ts, that were bitter contenders; among&s;t
<PB N="134" REF="037441_0211_100D8F0FDC720F08">whom one of their deacons, an envious man, finding the Lord's power was over them, cried out for very anger.

<P>The fir&s;t-day following I went into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e: and after the prie&s;t had done, I preached the truth to the people, and declared the word of life among&s;t them. The prie&s;t got away; and the magi&s;trates de&s;ired me to go out of the &s;teeple-hou&s;e. But I &s;till declared the way of the Lord unto them, and told them, I came to &s;peak the word of life and &s;alvation from the Lord among&s;t them. The power of the Lord was dreadful among&s;t them, &s;o that the people trembled and &s;hook; and they thought the &s;teeple-hou&s;e &s;hook; &s;ome of them feared it would have fallen down on their heads. The magi&s;trates wives were in a rage, and &s;trove mightily to have been at me: but the &s;oldiers and friendly people &s;tood thick about me. At length the rude people of the city ro&s;e, and came with &s;taves and &s;tones into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, crying, <Q>Down with the&s;e round-headed rogues:</Q> and they threw &s;tones. Where|upon the governor &s;ent a file or two of mu&s;queteers into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e to appea&s;e the tumult; and com|manded all the other &s;oldiers out. So tho&s;e &s;oldiers took me by the hand in a friendly manner, and &s;aid, they would have me along with them. When we came into the street, the city was in an uproar; the governor came down; and &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;oldiers were put in pri&s;on for &s;tanding by me again&s;t the town's-people. A lieutenant, who had been convinced, came and brought me to his hou&s;e, where there was a bapti&s;t meeting, and thither came friends al&s;o. We had a very quiet meeting; they heard the word of life glad|ly, and many received it. The next day, the ju&s;tices and magi&s;trates of the town being gathered together in the town-hall, they granted a warrant again&s;t me; and &s;ent for me before them. I was then gone to a bapti&s;t's; but hearing of it, I went up to the hall, where many rude people were: &s;ome of whom had &s;worn &s;trange fal&s;e things again&s;t me. I had a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e with the magi&s;trates, wherein I laid open the fruits of their prie&s;ts preaching; &s;hewed them how they were void of Chri&s;tianity; and that, though they were &s;uch great profe&s;&s;ors (for they were independents and pre&s;byterians) they were without the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that which they profei&s;ed. After a large examination, they com|mitted
<PB N="135" REF="037441_0212_100D8F11C392B7F8">me to pri&s;on as a bla&s;phemer, an heretick, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ducer; though they could not ju&s;tly charge any &s;uch thing again&s;t me. The gaol at Carli&s;le had two gaolers, an up|per and an under, who looked like two bear-wards. When I was brought in, the upper gaoler had me up into a great chamber, and told me, I &s;hould have what I would in that room. But I told him, he &s;hould not expect any money from me, for I would neither lie in any of his beds, nor eat any of his victuals. Then he put me into another room; where after awhile I got &s;omething to lie upon. There I lay till the a&s;&s;izes came; and then all the talk was, that I was to be hanged. The high &s;heriff, Wilfred Law&s;on, &s;tir|red them much up to take away my life; and &s;aid, He would guard me to my execution him&s;elf. They were in a rage, and &s;et three mu&s;queteers for guard upon me; one at my chamber-door, another at the &s;tairs-foot, and a third at the &s;treet-door; and they would let none come at me, except one &s;ometimes, to bring me &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary things. At night they would bring up prie&s;ts to me, &s;ometimes as late as the tenth hour; who were exceeding rude and de|vili&s;h. There were a company, of bitter Scotch prie&s;ts, pre&s;byterians, made up of envy and malice, who were not &s;it to &s;peak of the things of God, they were &s;o foul-mouthed; but the Lord by his power gave me dominion over them all, and I let them &s;ee both their fruits and their &s;pirits. Great ladies al&s;o (as they were called) came to &s;ee the man that they &s;aid was to die. While the judge, ju&s;tices, and &s;heriff were contriving together how they might put me to death, the Lord di&s;appointed their de&s;igns by an unexpect|ed way.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the judges of a&s;&s;ize and gaol-delivery for the north|ern parts, &s;itting at Carli&s;le.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are rai&s;ed up to do righteou&s;ne&s;s and ju&s;tice, and &s;ent forth to puni&s;h him that doth evil, and to en|courage him that doth well, and to &s;et the oppre&s;&s;ed free. I am therefore moved to lay before you the condition of
<PB N="136" REF="037441_0213_100D8F1490354EA8">GEORGE FOX, whom the magi&s;trates of this city have ca&s;t into pri&s;on for words that he is accu&s;ed to have &s;po|ken, which they call bla&s;phemy. He was &s;ent to the gaol, till he &s;hould be delivered by due cour&s;e of law; and it was expected he &s;hould have been proceeded again&s;t in the common law-cour&s;e at this a&s;&s;izes. The informations again&s;t him were delivered into court, and the act al|lows and appoints that way of trial. How hardly and unchri&s;tianly he hath been hitherto dealt with, I &s;hall not now mention; but you may con&s;ider, that nothing he is accu&s;ed of is nice and difficult. And, to my knowledge, he utterly abhors and dete&s;ts every particular which by the act again&s;t bla&s;phemous opinions is appointed to be puni&s;hed, and differs as much from tho&s;e people again&s;t whom the law was made, as light from darkne&s;s. Though he be committed, judgment is not given him, nor have his accu&s;ers been face to face, to affirm before him what they have informed again&s;t him; nor was he heard as to the particulars of their accu&s;ation, nor doth it appear that any word they charge again&s;t him is within the act. But indeed I could not yet &s;o much as &s;ee the information, no not in court, though I de&s;ired it both of the clerk of the a&s;&s;izes and of the magi&s;trate's clerk; nor hath he had a copy of them. This is very hard; and that he &s;hould be &s;o clo&s;e re&s;trained, that his friends may not &s;peak with him, I know no law nor rea&s;on for. I do therefore claim for him a due and lawful hearing, and that he may have a copy of his charge, and freedom to an&s;wer for him&s;elf; and that rather before you, than to be left to the rulers of this town, who are not competent judges of bla&s;phemy, as by their mittimus appears; who have committed him upon an act of parliament, and mention words as &s;poken by him at his examination which are not within the act, and which he utterly denies. The words mentioned in the mittimus he denies to have &s;poken, and hath neither pro|fe&s;&s;ed nor avowed them.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding this letter, the judges were re&s;olved not to &s;uffer me to be brought before them; but reviling and &s;coffing at me behind my back, left me to the magi&s;trates of the town: giving them what encouragement they could to exerci&s;e their cruelty upon me. Whereupon (though I had been kept &s;o clo&s;e in the gaoler's hou&s;e that friends
<PB N="137" REF="037441_0214_100D8F16CD0845F0">were not &s;uffered to come at me, and colonel. Ben&s;on and ju&s;tice Pear&s;on were denied to &s;ee me, yet) the next day, after the judges were gone out of town, an order was &s;ent to the gaoler to put me down into the pri&s;on among&s;t the mo&s;s-troopers, thieves, and murderers; which accordingly he did. A filthy, na&s;ty place it was, where men and wo|men were put together in a very uncivil manner, and never a hou&s;e of office to it; and the pri&s;oners &s;o lou&s;y, that one woman was almo&s;t eaten to death with lice. Yet as bad as the place was, the pri&s;oners were all made very loving and &s;ubject to me, and &s;ome of them were convinced of the truth, as the publicans and harlots were of old; &s;o that they were able to confound any prie&s;t that might come to the grates to di&s;pute. But the gaoler was cruel, and the under-gaoler very abu&s;ive both to me and to friends that came to &s;ee me; for he would beat friends with a great cudgel, who did but come to the window to look in upon me. I could get up to the grate, where &s;ometimes I took in my meat; at which the gaoler was often offended. Once he came in a great rage, and beat me with his cudgel, though I was not at the grate at that time; and as he beat me, he cried, come out of the window, though I was then far from it. While he &s;truck me, I was moved to &s;ing in the Lord's pow|er, which made him rage the more. Then he fetched a fiddler, and &s;et him to play, thinking to vex me; but while he played, I was moved in the everla&s;ting power of the Lord God to &s;ing; and my voice drowned the noi&s;e of the fiddle, &s;truck and confounded them, and made them give over fiddling and go their way.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice Ben&s;on's wife was moved of the Lord to come to vi&s;it me, and to eat no meat but what &s;he eat with me at the bars of the pri&s;on window. She was afterwards her|&s;elf impri&s;oned at York, when &s;he was great with child, for &s;peaking to a prie&s;t; and was kept in pri&s;on, and not &s;uffered to go out when the time of her travail was come: &s;o &s;he was delivered of her child in the pri&s;on. She was an hone&s;t, tender woman, and continued faithful to the truth until &s;he died.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was in pri&s;on at Carli&s;le, James Parnel, a little lad about &s;ixteen years of age, came to &s;ee me, and was convinced. The Lord quickly made him a powerful mi|ni&s;ter of the word of life, and many were turned to Chri&s;t by him, though he lived not long. For travelling into E&s;&s;ex in the work of the mini&s;try, in the year 1655, he
<PB N="138" REF="037441_0215_100D8F18F6C053B0">was committed to Colche&s;ter ca&s;tle, where he endured very great hard&s;hips and &s;ufferings; being put by the cruel gaoler into a hole in the ca&s;tle wall, called the oven, &s;o high from the ground that he went up to it by a ladder, which being &s;ix feet too &s;hort, he was obliged to climb from the ladder to the hole by a rope that was fa&s;tened above. And when friends would have given him a cord and a ba&s;|ket to have drawn up his victuals in, the inhuman gaoler would not &s;uffer them, but forced him to go down and up by that &s;hort ladder and rope to fetch his victuals (which for a long time he did) or el&s;e he might have fa|mi&s;hed in the hole. At length his limbs being much be|numbed with lying in that place, yet being obliged to go down to take up &s;ome victuals, as he came up the ladder again with his victuals in one hand, and catched at the rope with the other, he mi&s;&s;ed the rope and fell down from a very great height upon the &s;tones; by which fall he was &s;o wounded in his head, arms, and body, that he died in a &s;hort time after. When he was dead the wicked profe&s;&s;ors, to cover their cruelty, wrote a book of him, and &s;aid, "He fa&s;ted him&s;elf to death!" which was an abominable fal&s;ehood, and was manife&s;ted &s;o to be by another book, wrote in an&s;wer to that, called, <Q>The Lamb's Defence again&s;t Lies.</Q></P>
<P>When I &s;aw that I was not like to be brought to a pub|lick hearing and trial (although I had before an&s;wered in writing the particular matters charged again&s;t me at the time of my fir&s;t examination and commitment) I was mo|ved to &s;end the following paper, as a publick challenge to all tho&s;e that belied the truth and me behind my back, to come forth and make good their charge.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends, Thomas Cra&s;ton and Cuthbert Studholm,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR noi&s;e is gone up to London before the &s;ober people. What impri&s;oning, what gagging, what havock and &s;poiling the goods of people have you made within the&s;e few years! Unlike men; as though you had never read the &s;criptures, or had not minded them! Is this the end of Carli&s;le's religion? Is this the end of your mini&s;try? Is this the end of your church, and of your profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity? You have &s;hamed it by your folly, madne&s;s, and blind zeal. Was it not always the work of the blind guides, watchmen, leaders, and fal&s;e prophets, to prepare war again&s;t them that could not put into their mouths? Have not you been the prie&s;ts pack|hor&s;es and executioners? When they &s;pur you up to bear the &s;word again&s;t the ju&s;t, do not you run on again&s;t tho&s;e that cannot hold up &s;uch as the &s;criptures always te&s;tified again&s;t? Yet will you lift up your unholy hands, and call upon God with your polluted lips, and pretend a fa&s;t, who are full of &s;trife and debate. Did your hearts never burn within you? Did you never come to que&s;tion your
<PB N="140" REF="037441_0217_100D8F1CB5F93AF0">conditions? Are you wholly given up to do the devil's lu&s;ts, to per&s;ecute? Where is your loving enemies? Where is your entertaining &s;trangers? Where is your overcoming evil with good? Where are your teachers, that can &s;top the mouths of gain-&s;ayers, convince gain-&s;ayers, and &s;uch as oppo&s;e them&s;elves? Have you no mini&s;ters of the Spi|rit, no &s;oldiers with &s;piritual weapons, di&s;playing Chri&s;t's colours? But all the dragon's, the murderer's, the per&s;e|cutor's, arm of fle&s;h, Cain's weapons, chief prie&s;ts taking coun&s;el, Judas and the multitude with &s;words and &s;taves, Sodom's company raging about Lot's hou&s;e, like the prie&s;ts and princes again&s;t Jeremiah, like the dragon, bea&s;t, and great whore, and the fal&s;e church, which John &s;aw &s;hould ca&s;t into pri&s;on, kill, and per&s;ecute? Who&s;e weapons are you bearing? Doth not the fal&s;e church, the whore, make merchandize of cattle, corn, wine, and oil, even to the very &s;ouls of men? Hath not all this been &s;ince the true church went into the wilderne&s;s? Read Revelations the 12th, with the 18th: do you not read and &s;ee what a &s;pirit you are of, and what a bottomle&s;s pit you are in? Have not you di&s;honoured the place of ju&s;tice and authority? What! turned your &s;word back|ward, like madmen, who are a prai&s;e to the evil-doer, and would be a terror to the good, with all force and might to &s;top the way of ju&s;tice! Doth not the Lord, think you, behold your actions? How many have you wronged? How many have you impri&s;oned, per&s;ecuted, and put out of your &s;ynagogues? Are you they that mu&s;t fulfil the prophecy of Chri&s;t, Matth. xxiii. John xvi. Read the &s;criptures, &s;ee how unhke you are to the prophets, Chri&s;t, and his apo&s;tles, and what a vi&s;age you have, like unto them that per&s;ecuted the prophets, Chri&s;t, and the apo&s;|tles. You are found in their &s;teps, wre&s;tling with fle&s;h and blood, not with principalities and powers, and &s;piri|tual wickedne&s;s; your teachers impri&s;oning and per&s;e|cuting for outward things, you being their executioners; the like whereof hath not been in all the nations. The havork that hath been made, the &s;poiling of people's goods, taking away their oxen and fatted beeves, their &s;heep, corn, wool, and hou&s;hold goods, and giving them to the prie&s;ts that have done no work for them. More like mo&s;s-troopers than mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, they take them from friends; &s;uing them in your courts, and fining them becau&s;e they will not break the command of Chri&s;t;
<PB N="141" REF="037441_0218_100D8F1F93AA5510">that is, becau&s;e they will not &s;wear. Thus you act again&s;t them that do not lift up a hand again&s;t you, and as much as you turn again&s;t them you turn again&s;t Chri&s;t. But he is ri&s;en that will plead their cau&s;e, and you cannot be hid. Your works are come to light, and the end of your mini&s;try is &s;een, what it is for; for means. You have di&s;|honoured the truth, the go&s;pel; and are of tho&s;e that make it chargeable. You have lo&s;t your glory. You have di&s;|honoured your&s;elves. Per&s;ecution was ever blind and mad. Read the apo&s;tle, what he &s;aith of him&s;elf, when he was in your nature. Exaltation and pride, and your lifting up your&s;elves, hath brought you to this; not being humble, not doing ju&s;tice, not loving mercy. When &s;uch as have been beaten and brui&s;ed by your rude company to whom you are a prai&s;e and encouragement, have come and laid things before you, that you might have done ju&s;|tice, pre&s;erved and kept peace, you knowing they could not &s;wear, have put an oath to them. This hath been your trick and cover, that ye might not do ju&s;tice to the ju&s;t; but by this means go on &s;till further to encourage the evil-doer. But the Lord &s;ees your hearts! If ye were not men pa&s;t feeling, ye would fear and tremble before the God of the whole earth; who is ri&s;en, and will &s;tain your glory, mar your pride, deface your beauty, and lay it in the du&s;t. Though for a time you may &s;well in your pride, glory in your &s;hame, and make a mock of God's me&s;&s;engers, who, for reproving &s;in in the gate, are become your prey; you will feel the heavy hand of God and his judgments at the la&s;t. This is from a lover of the truth, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of your &s;ouls; but a witne&s;s again&s;t all &s;uch as make a trade of the prophets, Chri&s;t's, and the apo&s;tles words, and are found in the &s;teps of them who per&s;ecuted the prophets, Chri&s;t's and the apo&s;tles life; who per&s;ecute tho&s;e that will not hold you up, put into your mouths, and give you means. Tithes were before the law, and tithes were in the law; but tithes &s;ince the days of the apo&s;tles have been only &s;ince the fal&s;e church got up. Chri&s;t, who is come to end the law, and to end war, redeems men out of the tenths, and out of the nines al&s;o. The redeemed of the Lord &s;hall reign upon the earth, and know the election which was before the world began. Since the days of the apo&s;tles, tithes have been &s;et up by the papi&s;ts, and by them that went from the apo&s;tles into the world; &s;et up by the fal&s;e church that
<PB N="142" REF="037441_0219_100D8F219C46EFF8">made merchandize of the people, &s;ince the true chutch went into the wilderne&s;s. But now is the judgment of the great whore come; the bea&s;t and fal&s;e prophet (the old dragon) &s;hall be taken and ca&s;t into the fire, and the Lamb and his &s;aints &s;hall have the victory. Now it Chri&s;t come who will make war in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and de|&s;troy with the &s;word of his mouth all the&s;e inventors and inventions that have been &s;et up &s;ince the days of the apo&s;tles, and &s;ince the true church went into the wilder|ne&s;s. and the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, which is the power of God, &s;hall be preached again to all nations, kindreds, and tongues in this the Lamb's day; before whom you &s;hall appear to judgment. You have no way to e&s;cape. For he hath appeared who is the Fir&s;t and the La&s;t, the Be|ginning and the Ending, the Alpha and the Omega: he that was dead is alive again, and lives for evermore!</P>

<P>HE who is called George Fox, who is per&s;ecuted by rulers and magi&s;trates, by ju&s;tices, prie&s;ts, and pec|ple, and who &s;uffers the impri&s;onment of his body at this pre&s;ent time as a bla&s;phemer, an heretick, and a &s;educer, him do we witne&s;s (who in mea&s;ure are made partakers of the &s;ame life which lives in him) to be a mini&s;ter of the eternal word of God, by whom the everla&s;ting go&s;pel is preached; by the powerful preaching whereof the eternal Father of the &s;aints hath opened the blind eyes, un&s;top|ped the deaf ears, let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free, and hath rai&s;|ed the dead out of the graves. Chri&s;t is now preached in and among the &s;aints, the &s;ame that ever he was; and becau&s;e his heavenly image is borne up in this his faithful &s;ervant, therefore doth fallen man (rulers, prie&s;ts, and people) per&s;ecute him. Becau&s;e he lives up out of the fall, and te&s;tifies again&s;t the works of the world, that the deeds thereof are evil, he &s;uffers by you magi&s;trates, not as an evil-doer.

<P>Not long after this the Lord's power came over the ju&s;ti|ces, and they were made to &s;et me at liberty. But &s;ome time before the governor and Anthony Pear&s;on came down into the pri&s;on to &s;ee the place where I was kept, and un|der&s;tand what u&s;age I had. They found the place &s;o bad, and the favour &s;o ill, that they cried &s;hame of the magi&s;|trates for &s;uffering the gaoler to do &s;uch things.

<P>After I was &s;et at liberty I went to Thomas Bewley's, where came a bapti&s;t-teacher to oppo&s;e me; who was con|vinced. Robert Widders being with me was moved to go to Coldbeck &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and the bapti&s;t-teacher went along with him the &s;ame day. The people fell upon them, almo&s;t killed Robert Widders, and took the bapti&s;t's &s;word from him and beat him &s;orely. This bapti&s;t had the inhe|ritance of an impropriation of tithes, and he went home and gave it up freely. Robert Widders was &s;ent to Carli&s;le gaol, where having lain awhile he was &s;et at liberty. Wil|liam Dew&s;bury al&s;o went to a &s;teeple-hou&s;e hard by, and the people almo&s;t killed him, they beat him &s;o; but the Lord's power was over all and healed them again. In that day many friends went to the &s;teeple-hou&s;es to declare the truth to the prie&s;ts and people; and great &s;ufferings they underwent, but the Lord's power &s;u&s;tained them.</P>

<PB N="145" REF="037441_0222_100D8F27A4F31370">meetings. The everla&s;ting go&s;pel and word of life flou|ri&s;hed, thou&s;ands were turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and to his teaching. Several who had taken tithes as im|propriators denied the receiving of them any longer, and delivered them up freely to the pari&s;hioners. Pa&s;&s;ing into We&s;tmoreland I had many great meetings. At Strickland|bead I had a large meeting, where Henry Draper, a ju&s;tice of peace out of Bi&s;hoprick, came, and many contenders were there. The prie&s;ts and magi&s;trates were in a great rage again&s;t me in We&s;tmoreland, and had a warrant to ap|prehend me; which they renewed from time to time. Yet the Lord did not &s;uffer them to &s;erve it upon me. I tra|velled among&s;t friends, vi&s;iting meetings till I came to Swarthmore, where I heard the bapti&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors in Scotland had &s;ent to have a di&s;pute with me. I &s;ent them word, I would meet them in Cumberland at Thomas Bew|ley's, whither accordingly I went, but none of them came. Some dangers at this time I underwent in my travels. Going through Wigton on a market-day, the people of the town had &s;et a guard with pitch-forks; and though &s;ome of their own neighbours were with us, they kept us out of the town and would not let us pa&s;s through it, under a pretence of preventing the &s;ickne&s;s, which there was no occa&s;ion for. However, they fell upon us, and had like to have &s;poiled us and our hor&s;es; but the Lord re&s;trained them, that they did not much hurt; and we pa&s;&s;ed away. Another time, as we were pa&s;&s;ing between two friends hou&s;es, &s;ome rude fellows lay in wait in a lane, and exceed|ingly &s;toned and abu&s;ed us; but at la&s;t, through the Lord's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we got through them, and had not much hurt. But this &s;hewed the fruits of the prie&s;t's teaching, which &s;hamed their profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>After I had vi&s;ited friends in that county. I went into Bi&s;hoprick, having large meetings by the way. A very large meeting I had at Anthony Pear&s;on's, where many were convinced. From thence I pa&s;&s;ed through Northumber|land to Derwentwater, where we had great meetings; and the prie&s;ts threatened they would come, but no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> came. The everla&s;ting word of life was freely preached, and freely re|ceived; hundreds being turned to Chri&s;t, their teacher.</P>
<P>In Northumberland many came to di&s;pute. Some pleaded again&s;t perfection; to whom I declared, <Q>That Adam and Eve were perfect before they fell: and all that God made was perfect; and that the imperfection came
<PB N="146" REF="037441_0223_100D8F29C2612180">by the devil and the fall: but Chri&s;t, who came to de|&s;troy the devil,</Q> &s;aid, "Be ye perfect." One of the pro|fe&s;&s;ors alledged that Job &s;aid, <Q>Shall mortal man be more pure than his Maker? The heavens are not clean in his &s;ight. God charged his angels with folly.</Q> I &s;hewed him his mi&s;take, and let him &s;ee, <Q>it was not Job that &s;aid &s;o, but one of tho&s;e that contended again&s;t him; for Job &s;tood for perfection, and held his integrity; and they were called mi&s;erable comforters.</Q> The&s;e profe&s;&s;ors &s;aid, The outward body was the body of death and &s;in. I di&s;covered their mi&s;take in that al&s;o, &s;hewing them, <Q>That Adam and Eve had each of them an outward body, before the body of death and &s;in got into them; and that man and woman will have bodies, when the body of &s;in and death is put off again; when they are renewed up into the image of God again by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which they were in before they fell.</Q> They cea&s;ed at that time from oppo&s;ing, and glorious meetings we had in the Lord's power.</P>
<P>Then pa&s;&s;ed we to Hexam, where we had a great meet|ing atop of an hill. The prie&s;t threatened he would come and oppo&s;e us, but he came not; &s;o all was quiet: And <Q>the everla&s;ting day and renowned truth of the everliving God was &s;ounded over tho&s;e dark countries, and his Son exalted over all. It was proclaimed among&s;t the people, that the day was now come, wherein all that made a pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the Son of God, might receive him; and that to as many as would receive him, he would give power to become the &s;ons of God, as he had done to me.</Q> It was further declared, <Q>That he who had the Son of God, had life eternal; but he that had not the Son of God (though he profe&s;&s;ed all the &s;criptures, from the fir&s;t of Gene&s;is to the la&s;t of the Revelations) had no life.</Q> So after all were directed to the light of Chri&s;t, by which they might &s;ee him, receive him, and know where their true teacher was, and the everla&s;ting truth had been largely de|clared among&s;t them, we pa&s;&s;ed through Hexam peacea|bly, and came into Gil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">land, a country noted for thiev|ing.</P>
<P>Here a friend &s;pying the prie&s;t, went to &s;peak to him; wherenpon he came to our inn, and the town's-people ga|thered about us. The prie&s;t &s;aid, He would prove us de|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vers out of the bible, but could find no &s;cripture for his purpo&s;e. Then he went into the inn, and after awhile came out again, and brought &s;ome broken &s;entences of &s;cripture,
<PB N="147" REF="037441_0224_100D8F2B9E6186E0">that mention the doctrines and commandments of men, &amp;c. and Touch not. Ta&s;te not. &amp;c. for they peri&s;h with the u&s;ing. All which, poor man! was his own condition; whereas we were per&s;ecuted becau&s;e we would not ta&s;te, nor touch, nor handle their doctrines and traditions which we knew peri&s;hed with u&s;ing. I a&s;ked him, What he called the &s;teeple-hou&s;e? 'Oh,' &s;aid he, <Q>the dreadful hou&s;e of God, the temple of God.</Q> I &s;hewed him, and the poor, dark people, <Q>That their bodies &s;hould be the temples of God, and that Chri&s;t never commanded the&s;e temples, but ended that temple at Jeru&s;alem which God had com|manded.</Q> While I was &s;peaking, the prie&s;t got away: and afterwards the people made as if they feared we would take their pur&s;es, or &s;teal their hor&s;es; judging us like them|&s;elves, who are naturally given to thieving.</P>
<P>The next day we came into Cumberland again, where we had a general meeting of thou&s;ands of people atop of an hill near Langlands. A glorious and heavenly meeting it was; for the glory of the Lord did &s;hine over all; and there were as many as one could well &s;peak over the multitude was &s;o great. Their eyes were turned to Chri&s;t their teacher; and they came to &s;it under their own vine; in&s;omuch that Francis Howgill, coming afterwards to vi&s;it them, &s;ound they had no need of words; for they were &s;itting under their teacher Chri&s;t Je&s;us; in the &s;en&s;e whereof he &s;at down among&s;t them, without &s;peaking any thing. A great con|vincement there was in Cumberland, Bi&s;hoprick, Northum|berland. We&s;tmoreland, Lanca&s;hire, and York&s;hire; and the plants of God grew and flouri&s;hed, the heavenly rain de|&s;cending. and God's glory &s;hining upon them: many mouths were opened by the Lord to his prai&s;e; yea, to babes and &s;ucklings he ordained &s;trength.</P>
<P>After my relea&s;e from Carli&s;le pri&s;on, I was moved to go to prie&s;t Wilkin&s;on's &s;teeple-hou&s;e again: and being got in before him, when he came, I was declaring the truth to the people, though they were but few; for the mo&s;t and be&s;t of his hearers were turned to Chri&s;t's free teaching; and we had a meeting of friends hard-by, where Thomas Stubbs was declaring the word of life among&s;t them. As &s;oon as the prie&s;t came in he oppo&s;ed me: and there we &s;taid mo&s;t part of the day: for when I began, he oppo&s;ed me &s;o if any law was broken, he broke it. When his people would be haling me out, I manife&s;ted his fruits to be &s;uch as Chri&s;t &s;pake of, when he &s;aid. <Q>They &s;hall hale you out of
<PB N="148" REF="037441_0225_100D8F2DCB618360">their &s;ynagogues:</Q> and then he would be a&s;hamed, and they would let me alone. There did he &s;tand, till it was almo&s;t night, jangling, and oppo&s;ing me; and would not go to his dinner, for he thought to have wearied me out. But at la&s;t the Lord's power and truth came &s;o over him, that he packed away with his people. When he was gone, I went to the meeting of friends, who were turned to the Lord, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by his power upon Chri&s;t, the rock and foundation of the true prophets and apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>About this time the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors fell to prophe|&s;ying again&s;t us afre&s;h. They had &s;aid long before, That we &s;hould be de&s;troyed within a month; after that, they prolonged the time to half a year: but that time being long expired, and we mightily increa&s;ed in number, they now gave out, That we would eat out one another. For after meetings, many tender people, having a great way to go, tarried at friends hou&s;es by the way, and &s;ometimes more than there were beds to lodge in; &s;o that &s;ome have lain on the hay-mows: hereupon fear po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the profe&s;&s;ors and world's people. For they were afraid, that when we had eaten one another out, we would all come to be maintained by the pari&s;hes, and be chargeable to them. But after awhile, when they &s;aw that the Lord ble&s;&s;ed and increa&s;ed friends, as he did Abraham, both in the field and in the ba&s;ket, at their goings forth and comings in, at their ri&s;ings up and lyings down, and that all things pro&s;pered with them; then they &s;aw the fal&s;ehood of all their prophecies again&s;t us; and that it was in vain to cur&s;e where God had ble&s;&s;ed. At the fir&s;t convincement, when friends could not put off their hats to people, nor &s;ay You to a &s;ingle per&s;on, but Thou and Thee, or could not bow, nor u&s;e flattering words in &s;alutations, nor go into the fa&s;hions and cu&s;toms of the world; many friends, that were trade&s;men, lo&s;t their cu&s;tomers; for the people were &s;hy of them, and would not trade with them; &s;o that for a time &s;ome could hardly get money enough to buy bread. But afterwards, when people came to have experience of friends hone&s;ty and faithfulne&s;s and found that their Yea was Yea, and their Nay was Nay; that they kept to a word in their dealings, and that they would not cozen and cheat them; but that if they &s;ent a child to their &s;hops for any thing, they were as well u&s;ed as if they had come them&s;elves; the lives and conver&s;ations of friends did preach, and reached to the witne&s;s of God in the people. Then things altered &s;o, that all the inquiry
<PB N="149" REF="037441_0226_100D8F3094E3B3B8">was. <Q>Where was a draper, or &s;hopkeeper, or taylor, or &s;hoemaker, or any other trade&s;man, that was a Quaker?</Q> In&s;omuch that friends had more bu&s;ine&s;s than many of their neighbours; and if there was any trading, they had a great part of it. Then the envious profe&s;&s;ors altered their note, and began to cry out. 'If we let the&s;e Quakers' one, they 'will take the trade of the nation out of our hands.' This hath been the Lord's doings to and for his people! which my de&s;ire is, that all who profe&s;s his holy truth may be truly kept &s;en&s;ible of; and that all may be pre&s;erved in and by his power and Spirit, faithful to God and man: fir&s;t to God, in obeying him in all things; and then in doing unto all men that which is ju&s;t and righteous, in all things that they have to do or deal with them in: that the Lord God may be glorified in their practi&s;ing truth, holine&s;s, godli|ne&s;s, and righteou&s;ne&s;s among&s;t people, in their lives and conver&s;ations.</P>
<P>Friends being grown very numerous in the northern parts of this nation, and divers young convinced ones com|ing daily in among us, I was moved of the Lord to write the following epi&s;tle, and &s;end it among&s;t them, for the &s;litting up the pure mind, and rai&s;ing an holy care and watchfulne&s;s in them over them&s;elves, and one another, for the honour of truth.</P>

<P>IN the mea&s;ure of the life of God wait for wi&s;dom from God, from whom it comes. And all ye, who are chil|dren of God, wait for the living food from the living God, to be nouri&s;hed up to eternal life, from the one fountain from whence life comes; that in order ye may all be guided and walk: &s;ervants in your places, young men and young women in your places, and rulers of families; that every one, in your re&s;pective places, may adorn the truth in the mea&s;ure of it. With it let your minds be kept up to the Lord Je&s;us, from whence it doth come; that a &s;weet &s;a|vour ye may be to God, and in wi&s;dom ye may all be ordered and ruled: that a crown and a glory ye may be one to another in the Lord. And that no &s;trife, bitter|ne&s;s, nor &s;elf-will may appear among&s;t you; but with the Light in which the unity is, all that may be condemned. And that every one in particular may &s;ee to and take care of the ordering and ruling of their own family; that in

And that no fruitle&s;s trees be among you; but all out down, condemned by the light, and ca&s;t into the fire; that every one may bear and bring forth fruit to God, and grow fruitful in his knowledge and in his wi&s;dom; and that none may appear in words, beyond what they are in the life that gave forth the words. Here none &s;hall be as the untimely figs; none &s;hall be of tho&s;e trees who&s;e fruit withers: &s;uch go in Cain's way, from the light; and by it are condemned. Let none of you boa&s;t your&s;elves above your mea&s;ure; if you do, out of God's kingdom you are excluded: for in that boa&s;ting part gets up the pride and the &s;trife which is contrary to the light that leads to the kingdom of God, gives an entrance thereinto, and an under&s;tanding to know the things that belong to the kingdom.

<P>While friends abode in the northern parts, a prie&s;t of Wrexham in Wales, named Morgan Floyd, having heard reports concerning us, &s;ent two of his congregation into the north to inquire concerning us, to try us, and bring him an account of us. When the&s;e triers came among&s;t us, the power of the Lord &s;eized on them, and they were both convinced of the truth. So they &s;taid &s;ome time with us, and then returned to Wales; where afterwards one of them departed from his convincement; but the other named John-ap-John, abode in the truth, and received a part of the mini&s;try, in which he continued faithful.</P>
<P>Now were the prie&s;ts greatly di&s;turbed at Newca&s;tle, Kendal, and in mo&s;t of the northern counties. There be|ing one Gilpin, who had &s;ometimes come among&s;t us at Kendal, and &s;oon ran out from the truth into vain imagi|nations; they made what evil u&s;e they could of him again&s;t us; but the Lord's power confounded them all. And the Lord God cut off two of tho&s;e per&s;ecuting ju&s;tices at Car|li&s;le; and the other, after a time, was turned out of his place, and left the town.</P>
<P>About this time the oath or engagement to O. Cromwel was tendered to the &s;oldiers; many of whom were di&s;band|ed, becau&s;e in obedience to Chri&s;t, they could not &s;wear: John Stubbs, for one, who was convinced when I was in Carli&s;le pri&s;on, became a good &s;oldier in the Lamb's war, and a faithful mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t Je&s;us; travelling much in the &s;ervice of the Lord in Holland, Ireland, Scotland, Italy, Egypt, and America. And the Lord's power pre|&s;erved him out of the hands of the papi&s;ts, though many times he was in great danger of the inqui&s;ition. But &s;ome of the &s;oldiers, who had been convinced in their judgment, but had not come into obedience to the truth, took O. Cromwel's oath; and, going afterwards into Scotland, and coming before a garri&s;on there, the garri&s;on thinking they
<PB N="152" REF="037441_0229_100D8F3668D46480">had been enemies, &s;ired at them, and killed divers of them; which was a &s;ad event.</P>
<P>When the churches were &s;ettled in the north, and friends were &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t down under Chri&s;t's teaching, and the glory of the Lord &s;hined over them, I pa&s;&s;ed from Swarthmore to Lanca&s;ter about the beginning of the year 1654, vi&s;iting friends, till I came to Synder hill-green, where a meeting was appointed three weeks before; leaving the north fre&s;h and green, under Chri&s;t their teacher. We pa&s;&s;ed through Hali&s;ax, a rude town of profe&s;&s;ors, and came to Thomas Taylor's, who had been a captain, where we met with &s;ome janglers: but the Lord's power was over all; for I travel|led in the motion of God's power. When I came to Synde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-hill-green, there was a mighty meeting; &s;ome thou|&s;ands of people, as it was judged, and many per&s;ons of note were there, captains, and other officers; and there was a general convincement; for the Lord's power and truth was &s;et over all, and there was no oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>About this time did the Lord move upon the &s;pirits of many whom he had rai&s;ed up, and &s;ent forth to labour in his vineyard, to travel &s;outhwards, and &s;pread them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel to the ea&s;tern, &s;outhern, and we&s;tern parts of the nation: Francis Howgill and Edward Burrough to London; John Camin and John Audland to Bri&s;tol; Richard Hubberthorn and George Whitehead to|wards Norwich; Thomas Holmes into Wales, and many others different ways: for above &s;ixty mini&s;ters had the Lord rai&s;ed up, and did now &s;end abroad out of the north country. The &s;en&s;e of their &s;ervice being very weighty upon me, I was moved to give forth the following paper:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To friends in the mini&s;try:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL friends every where, Know the Seed of God, which brui&s;eth the &s;eed of the &s;erpent, and is atop of the &s;eed of the &s;erpent; which Seed &s;ins not, but brui&s;|eth the &s;erpent's head that doth &s;in, and tempts to &s;in: which Seed God's promi&s;e and ble&s;&s;ing is to; and which is one in the male and in the female. Where it is head, and hath brui&s;ed the head of the other, to the beginning you are come; and the younger is known, and he that is &s;ervant to the younger; and the promi&s;e of God, which is to the Seed, is fulfilled and fulfilling; and the &s;criptures come to be opened and owned; and the fle&s;h of Chri&s;t
<PB N="153" REF="037441_0230_100D8F38DABB0098">known, who took upon him the &s;eed of Abraham accord|ing to the fle&s;h; the everla&s;ting prie&s;thood known, and everla&s;ting covenant. Chri&s;t takes upon him the &s;eed of Abraham, and is a prie&s;t after the order of Melchi&s;edeck; without father, without mother, without beginning of days or end of life: this is the prie&s;t that ever lives; the cove|nant of life, light, and peace. The everla&s;ting offering here is known once for all, which offering overthrows that nature which offered; out of which the prie&s;thood aro&s;e, that could not continue by rea&s;on of death. And here is the other offering known, the everla&s;ting offering; which perfects for ever them that are &s;anctified: which offering blotted out the hand-writing of ordinances, triumphs over them, and a&s;cends above all principalities and powers. He that hath the Spirit of Je&s;us, &s;ees this; and here is the love of God received, that doth not rejoice in iniqui|ty, but leads to repent of it. This is the word of the Lord God to you all, friends every where &s;cattered abroad, Know the power of God in one another, and in that re|joice; for then you rejoice in the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, who is not of the world; which cro&s;s is the power of God to all them that are &s;aved. You, that know and feel the power, you feel the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, you feel the go&s;pel, which is the power of God unto &s;alvation to every one that believ|eth. He that believes in the light, believes in the ever|la&s;ting covenant, in the one offering, comes to the life of the prophets and Mo&s;es, comes to &s;ee Chri&s;t the hope, the my&s;tery, which hope peri&s;heth not; lets you &s;ee the hope that peri&s;heth, which is not that my&s;tery: and the expecta|tion in that peri&s;hing hope fades. Where this never-failing hope is witne&s;&s;ed, the Lord comes to be &s;anctified in the heart, and you come to the beginning, to Chri&s;t the hope, which peri&s;heth not; but the other hope, the other expect|ation peri&s;heth. So all of you, know the peri&s;hing of the other, and the failing of the expectation therein; and know that which peri&s;heth not: that you may be ready to give a rea&s;on of this hope with meekne&s;s and fear, to every man that a&s;keth you. Chri&s;t the hope, the my&s;tery, peri&s;heth not; the end of all peri&s;hing things, the end of all changeable things, the end of the decaying covenant, the end of that which waxeth old; the end of the fir&s;t co|venant, of Mo&s;es, and of the prophets; the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God. Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Son: his throne ye will know, heirs with him ye will be; who makes his children kings
<PB N="154" REF="037441_0231_100D8F3A6A6BF858">and prie&s;ts to him, and brings them to know his throne, and his power. There is no ju&s;tification out of the light, out of Chri&s;t; ju&s;tification is in the light, in Chri&s;t. Here is the doer of the will of God; here is the entering into the kingdom. He that believes in the light, becomes a child of light; and here the wi&s;dom is received, that is ju&s;tified of her children. Here believing in the light, you &s;hall not abide in darkne&s;s; but &s;hall have the light of life; and come every one to witne&s;s the light that &s;hines in your hearts, which will give you the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t. With this light you will &s;ee him reign, who is the prince of life and peace; which light turns from him that is out of the truth, and abode not in it; where the true peace is not.</P>
<P>Friends. Be not ha&s;ty: for he that believes in the light, makes not ha&s;te. Here the grace is received, by which you come to be &s;aved; the election is known, which ob|tains the promi&s;e; the will is &s;een, that wills; the mind is known. that runs, which obtains not; but &s;tops and dulls. Now, that with the light being &s;een, and judged, and &s;topped, the patience is here known, which obtains the crown; and the immortality is brought to light. So all who act contrary to the light, and do not believe in it, do not come to ju&s;tification. And all friends, if you go from the light, from wanting to have the promi&s;e of God fulfilled to the Seed, whereby you may know Chri&s;t reign, you thereby bring on your&s;elves changeable garments, and come to wear the changeable garments, and the &s;trange fle&s;h, which leads to adultery, which the law goes upon; which &s;huts out of the kingdom: and out of this will doth proceed the work or building that is for the fire; whereby you may come to &s;uffer lo&s;s. Therefore love the light, which doth condemn that; and receive the power from the Lord, with which you &s;tand over that, and condemn it; feeling and &s;eeing that which gives you victory over the world, and to &s;ee out of time, to before time. Again, friends, Know Abraham, that mu&s;t obey the voice of Sa|rah, that bears &s;eed; which ca&s;ts forth the bond-woman and her &s;on. Do not go forth, there will the wildne&s;s lodge. Know that which bears the wild &s;on, and its mo|ther, who is not Sarah; for the promi&s;e is to the Seed, not of many, but one; which &s;eed is Chri&s;t: and this &s;eed now you come to witne&s;s &s;tands on the top of all,
<PB N="155" REF="037441_0232_100D8F3C00C5C4E8">yea, on the head of the &s;erpent. And &s;o all, as I &s;aid before, who come to feel and witne&s;s this, come to the beginning: and this to all the &s;eed of God, the church, that it you may all come to know, where there is no ble|mi&s;h, nor &s;pot, nor wrinkle, nor any &s;uch thing. This is that which is purcha&s;ed by the blood of Je&s;us, and to the Father pre&s;ented out of all that defiles; which is the pillar and ground of truth. None attain to this, but &s;uch who come to the light of Chri&s;t, who purcha&s;ed this church. They who go from the light, are &s;hut out and condemned, though they profe&s;s all the &s;criptures declared from it. Therefore walk in the light, that you may have fellow&s;hip with the Son, and with the Father; and come all to wit|ne&s;s his image, his power, and his law, which is his light, that hath converted your &s;ouls, and brought them to &s;ub|mit to the higher power, above that which is out of the truth: that you may know here the mercy and truth, and the faith that works by love, which Chri&s;t is the author of; who lighteth every one of you: which faith gives the victory. That which gives the victory, is perfect; and that which the mini&s;ters of God received from God, is that which is perfect; and that which they are to mini&s;ter, is for the perfecting of the &s;aints; till they all come in the unity of the faith unto a perfect man. This is the word of the Lord to you all: Every one in the mea&s;ure of life wait. that with it all your minds may be guided up to the Father of life, the Father of &s;pirits: to receive power from him, and wi&s;dom, that with it you may be ordered to his glory: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o whom be all glory for ever! All keep in the light and life, that judgeth down that which is contrary to the light and life. So the Lord God Almighty be with you all. And keep your meetings every-where, being guided by that of God; by that you may &s;ee the Lord among you, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world; that men who are come into the world might be|lieve. He that believeth not, the light condemns him he that believeth, cometh out of condemnation. This light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, which they that hate it &s;tumble at, is the light of men.</P>
<P>All friends that &s;peak in publick, &s;ee that it be in the life of God; for that begets to God; the fruits of that &s;hall never wither. This &s;ows to the Spirit which is in pri&s;on, and of the Spirit reaps life; and the other &s;ows to the
<PB N="156" REF="037441_0233_100D8F3EAF1AC6E0">fle&s;h, and of the fle&s;h reaps corruption. This you may &s;ee all the world over among&s;t the&s;e &s;eeds-men, what may be reaped in the field, that is the world. Therefore in the Spirit of the Lord wait, which cuts down and ca&s;ts out all this, the root and branches of it. So in that wait to receive power, and the Lord God Almighty pre&s;erve you in it; whereby you may come to &s;eel the light, that comprehends time and the world, and fathoms it: which, believed in, gives you victory over the world. Here the power of the Lord is received, which &s;ubdues all the con|trary, and puts off the garments that will &s;tain and pol|lute. With this light you come to reach the light in every man, which Chri&s;t enlightens every man that cometh into the world withal; and here the things of Chri&s;t come to be known, and the voice of Chri&s;t heard. Therefore keep in the light, the covenant of peace; and walk in the covenant of life. There is that which maketh merry over the witne&s;s of God, and there is that which maketh merry in the Lord; which rejoiceth over that which hath made merry over it: of that take notice, you who be in the light. Such the Lord doth beautify, who&s;e tru&s;t is in his &s;trength; and the Lord doth &s;ee &s;uch, and them that are in his light. But &s;uch as be from the light, who&s;e eyes are after their abominations and idols, their eyes are to be blinded, their beautiful idols and their abominations to be de&s;troyed, and by the light condemned, which they have made from the life in their own &s;trength: which with the light is &s;een, and overthrown by the power of God. <Q>If you can change my covenant,</Q> faith the Lord, <Q>which keeps the day in its &s;ea&s;on, and the night in its &s;ea&s;on (mark, my covenant, the light) if you can change this, then may you change the covenant of God with his &s;eed.</Q> So all friends that are turned to the light which cometh from him by whom the world was made, who was before it was made, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Saviour of your &s;ouls, abide in the light, and you will &s;ee your &s;alvation to be walls and bulwarks again&s;t that which the light di&s;covers to be contrary to it. Waiting in the light you will re|ceive the power of God, which is the go&s;pel of peace, that you may be &s;hod with it. Know that in one another which rai&s;eth up the &s;eed of God, &s;ets it over the world and the earth, and cruci&s;ies the affections and lu&s;ts: then the truth comes to reign, which is the guide.</P>

About this time Rice Jones of Nottingham (who had been a Bapti&s;t and was turned Ranter) and his company began to prophe&s;y again&s;t me, giving out. That I was then at the highe&s;t, and after that time I &s;hould fall down as fa&s;t. He &s;ent a bundle of railing papers from Nottingham to Mansfield, Clau&s;on, and the towns thereabouts, judging friends for declaring the truth in the markets and in the &s;teeple-hou&s;es; which papers I an&s;wered. But their pro|phecies came upon them&s;elves; for &s;oon after they fell to pieces, and many of his followers became friends, and con|tinued &s;o. And through the Lord's ble&s;&s;ed power truth and friends have increa&s;ed, and do increa&s;e in the increa&s;e of God; and I by the &s;ame power have been and am pre|&s;erved, and kept in the everla&s;ting &s;eed that never fell nor changes. But Rice Jones took the oaths that were put to him, and &s;o di&s;obeyed the command of Chri&s;t. Many &s;uch fal&s;e prophets have ri&s;en up again&s;t me, but the Lord hath bla&s;ted them, and will bla&s;t all who ri&s;e again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed &s;eed, and me in that. My confidence is in the Lord; for who&s;oever did, I &s;aw their end, and how the Lord would confound them before he &s;ent me forth.</P>
<P>I was now at Synder-hill-green, where I had a large meeting in the day-time, and another at night in Thomas Stacy's hou&s;e; for the people came from far and could not &s;oon depart. The high &s;heriff of the county told captain Bradford he intended to come up, with half a dozen of his troopers, to the meeting; but the Lord prevented him. When I had &s;taid &s;ome meetings thereabouts, I travelled up and down in York&s;hire as far as Holderne&s;s, and to the Land's-end that way, vi&s;iting friends and the churches of Chri&s;t; which were &s;inely &s;ettled under his teaching. At length I reached captain Bradford's hou&s;e, whither many Ranters came from York to wrangle; but they were con|founded. Thither came &s;he called the lady Montague; who was then convinced, and lived and died in the truth.</P>
<P>Then I went to Thomas Taylor's within three miles of Halifax, where was a meeting of about two hundred peo|ple; among&s;t which were many rude per&s;ons, and divers butchers, who had bound them&s;elves with an oath before they came out, that they would kill me (as I was told): one of tho&s;e butchers had been accu&s;ed for killing a man and a woman. They came in a very rude manner, and made a great di&s;turbance in the meeting, which being in a clo&s;e, Thomas Taylor &s;tood up and &s;aid to them, <Q>If you
<PB N="158" REF="037441_0235_100D8F42E812F110">will be civil, you may &s;tay; but if not, I charge you to be gone from off my ground.</Q> But they grew wor&s;e, and &s;aid they would make it like a common; and they yelled and made a noi&s;e as if they had been at a bear-baiting. They thru&s;t friends up and down, who being peaceable, the Lord's power came over them. Several times they pu&s;h'd me off from the place I &s;tood on, by the crowding of the people together again&s;t me; but &s;till I was moved of the Lord to &s;tand up again as I was thru&s;t down. At la&s;t I was moved of the Lord to &s;ay to them, <Q>If they would di&s;|cour&s;e of the things of God, let them come up to me one by one; and if they had any thing to object, I would an|&s;wer them all, one after another;</Q> but they were all &s;ilent, and had nothing to &s;ay: and then the Lord's power came &s;o over them all, and an&s;wered the divine witne&s;s in them, that they were bound by the power of God, and a glorious powerful meeting we had, and the minds of the people were turned by the holy Spirit in them to God, and to Chri&s;t their teacher. The powerful word of life was largely declared that day, and in the life and power of God we broke up our meeting; and that rude company went their way to Halifax. The people a&s;ked them, <Q>Why they did not kill me, according to the oath they had &s;worn?</Q> They maliciou&s;ly an&s;wered, <Q>I had &s;o bewitched them they could not do it.</Q> Thus was the devil chained at that time. Friends told me, they u&s;ed to come at other times and be very rude, and &s;ometimes break their &s;eats and make frightful work among&s;t them; but the Lord's power had now bound them. Shortly after, this butcher, that had been accu&s;ed of killing a man and a woman be|fore, and who was one of tho&s;e that had bound him&s;elf by an oath to kill me, killed another man, and was thereupon &s;ent to York gaol. Another of tho&s;e rude butchers, who had al&s;o &s;worn to kill me, having accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to thru&s;t his tongue out of his mouth in deri&s;ion of friends when they pa&s;&s;ed by him, had his tongue &s;o &s;wollen out of his month that he could never draw it in again, but died &s;o. Several &s;trange and &s;udden judgments came upon many of the&s;e con&s;pirators again&s;t me, which would be too large to declare here. God's vengeance from heaven came upon the blood-thir&s;ty, who &s;oughe after blood; for all &s;uch &s;pi|rits I laid before the Lord, and left him to deal with them, who is &s;tronger than all, in who&s;e power I was pre|&s;erved and carried on to do his work. The Lord hath
<PB N="159" REF="037441_0236_100D8F455F0FC070">rai&s;ed a fine people in tho&s;e parts, whom he hath drawn to Chri&s;t, and gathered in his name; who feel Chri&s;t among&s;t them, and &s;it under his teaching.</P>
<P>After this I came to Balby; from whence &s;everal friends accompanied me into Lincoln&s;hire, of whom &s;ome went to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and &s;ome to private meetings. There came to the meeting where I was, the &s;heriff of Lincoln, and &s;everal with him; who made great contention and jan|gling for a time: but at length the Lord's power &s;truck him, that he was convinced of the truth, and received the word of life, as did &s;everal others al&s;o who had oppo&s;ed, and continued among&s;t friends till they died. Great meetings there were, and a large convincement in tho&s;e parts. Many were turned to the Lord Je&s;us, and came to &s;it under his teaching, leaving their prie&s;ts and their &s;uper&s;titious ways; and the day of the Lord flouri&s;hed over all among&s;t them that came to our meetings in that country. One called Sir Richard Wrey was convinced; al&s;o his brother and his brother's wife, who abode in the truth and died therein; though he afterwards ran out.</P>
<P>Having vi&s;ited tho&s;e countries, I came into Derby&s;hire; the &s;heriff of Lincoln, who was lately convinced, being with me. In one meeting we had &s;ome oppo&s;ition; but the Lord's glorious power gave dominion over all. At night came a company of bailiffs and &s;erving-men, and called me out. I went out to them, having &s;ome friends with me. They were exceeding rude and violent; for they had, it &s;eems, plotted together, and intended to have carri|ed me away with them in the dark of the evening by force, to have done me a mi&s;chief; but the Lord's power chained them, &s;o that they could not effect their de&s;ign; and at la&s;t they went away. The next day Thomas Aldam, under|&s;tanding the &s;erving-men belonged to a knight, who lived not far off, went to his hou&s;e and laid before him the bad carriage of his &s;ervants. The knight rebuked them, and did not allow of their evil behaviour towards us.</P>
<P>After this we came to Skegby, in Nottingham&s;hire, where we had a great meeting of divers &s;orts; and the Lord's power went over them, and all was quiet. The people were turned to the Spirit of God, by which many came to receive his power, and to &s;it under the teaching of Chri&s;t, their Saviour. A great people the Lord hath in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed towards Kid&s;ley-park, where came many Rant|ers;
<PB N="160" REF="037441_0237_100D8F47D7EC09E8">but the Lord's power check'd them. From thence I went into the Peak-country to Thomas Hammer&s;ley's where came the Ranters of that country, and many high profe&s;&s;ors. The Ranters oppo&s;ed me, and fell a &s;wearing. When I reproved them for &s;wearing, they would bring &s;cripture for it, alledging Abraham, Jacob, and Jo&s;eph &s;wore; and the prie&s;ts, Mo&s;es, the prophets, and the angels &s;wore. <Q>I confe&s;&s;ed all the&s;e did &s;o, as the &s;cripture re|cords; but &s;aid I. Chri&s;t (who &s;aid, Before Abraham was I am) commanded, Swear not at all. Chri&s;t ends the prophets, the old prie&s;thood, the di&s;pen&s;ation of Mo&s;es, and reigns over the hou&s;e of Jacob and Jo&s;eph; and he &s;ays, Swear not at all. And God, when he bringeth the fir&s;t-begotten into the world, &s;aith, Let all the angels of God wor&s;hip him, to wit, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who &s;aith. Swear not at all. As for the plea that men make for &s;wearing to end their &s;trife, Chri&s;t, who &s;ays. Swear not at all, de|&s;troys the devil and his works, who is the author of &s;trife; for that is one of his works. And God &s;aid, <Q>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed; hear ye him.</Q> So the Son is to be heard who forbids &s;wearing. And the apo&s;tle James, who did hear the Son of God, followed him, and preached him, forbids all oaths, James v. 12.</Q> So the Lord's power went over them: and his Son and his doctrine was &s;et over them. The word of life was fully and richly preached, and many were convinced that day. This Thomas Hammer&s;ly being &s;ummoned to &s;erve upon a jury, was admitted to &s;erve without an oath; and being foreman of the jury, when he brought in the verdict, the judge declared, <Q>That he had been a judge &s;o many years, but never heard a more upright verdict than that Quaker had then brought in.</Q> Much might be written of things of this nature, which time would fail to declare. But the Lord's ble&s;&s;ed power and truth was exalted over all, who is worthy of all prai&s;e and glory for ever!</P>
<P>Travelling through Derby&s;hire. I vi&s;ited friends till I came to Swanington, in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, where was a general meeting, to which many Ranters, Bapti&s;ts, and other pro|fe&s;&s;ors came: for great conte&s;ts there had been with them, and with the prie&s;ts in that town. To this meeting &s;everal friends came from divers parts; John Audland. Francis Howgill, Edward Pyot from Bri&s;tol, and Edward Burrough from London; and &s;everal were convinced in tho&s;e parts.
<PB N="161" REF="037441_0238_100D8F49F7276280">The Ranters made a di&s;turbance, and were very rude; but at la&s;t the Lord's power came over them, and they were confounded. The next day Jacob Bottomly, a great Ranter, came from Leice&s;ter; but the Lord's power &s;topt him, and came over them all. There came a prie&s;t too; but he al&s;o was confounded by the mighty power of the Lord. About this time the prie&s;ts, Bapti&s;ts, Ranters, and other profe&s;&s;ors were very rude, and &s;tirred up rude peo|ple again&s;t us. We &s;ent to the Ranters to come forth, and try their god. Abundance of them came, who &s;ung, whi&s;|tled, and danced; but the Lord's power &s;o prevailed over them that many of them were convinced.</P>
<P>After this I went to Twycro&s;s, whither came &s;ome Rant|ers, who &s;ung and danced before me; but I was moved in the dread of the Lord to reprove them: and the Lord's power came over them, &s;o that &s;ome of them were convin|ced, and received the Spirit of God; who are become a pretty people, living and walking &s;oberly in the truth of Chri&s;t. I went to Anthony Brickley's, in Warwick&s;hire, where there was a great meeting; &s;everal Bapti&s;ts and others came and jangled: but the Lord's power came over them.</P>
<P>Then I went to Drayton, in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, to vi&s;it my relations. As &s;oon as I was come in, Nathaniel Stephens, the prie&s;t, having got another prie&s;t, and given notice to the country, &s;ent to me to come to them; for they could not do any thing till I came. I, having been three years away from my relations, knew nothing of their de&s;ign. But at la&s;t I went into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e yard, where the two prie&s;ts were; and they had gathered abundance of people. They would have had me gone into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e. I a&s;ked them, what I &s;hould do there? They &s;aid, Mr. Stephens could not bear the cold. I told them, he might bear it as well as I. At la&s;t we went into a great hall, Richard Farn&s;worth being with me; and a great di&s;pute we had with the&s;e prie&s;ts concerning their practice, how contraty they were to Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. The prie&s;ts would know where tithes were forbidden or ended. I &s;hewed them out of the &s;eventh chapter to the Hebrews, <Q>That not only tithes, but the prie&s;thood that took tithes, was ended; and the law was ended and di&s;an|nulled by which the prie&s;thood was made, and tithes were commanded to be paid.</Q> Then they &s;tirred up the people to &s;ome lightne&s;s and rudene&s;s. I had known Stephens from a child, therefore I laid open his condition and the
<PB N="162" REF="037441_0239_100D8F4B8D030630">manner of his preaching: <Q>and how he, like the re&s;t of the prie&s;ts, did apply the promi&s;es to the fir&s;t birth which mu&s;t die. But I &s;hewed that the promi&s;es were to the &s;eed, not to many &s;eeds, but to the one &s;eed, Chri&s;t; who was one in male and female: for all were to be born again, before they could enter into the kingdom of God.</Q> Then he &s;aid, I mu&s;t not judge &s;o. I told him, <Q>He that was &s;piritual judged all things.</Q> Then he confe&s;&s;ed, That was a full &s;cripture; But, neighbours, &s;aid he, this is the bu&s;i|ne&s;s; GEORGE FOX is come to the light of the &s;un, and n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> he thinks to put out my &s;tar-light. I told him, <Q>I would not quench the lea&s;t mea&s;ure of God in any, much le&s;s put out his &s;tar-light, if it were true light from the morning-&s;tar. But I told him, if he had any thing from Chri&s;t, he ought to &s;peak it freely, and not take tither from the people for preaching; &s;eeing Chri&s;t commanded his mini&s;ters to give freely, as they had received freely.</Q> So I charged him to preach no more for tithes or any hire. But he &s;aid, he would not yield-to that. After awhile the people began to be vain and rude, whereupon we broke up; yet &s;ome were made loving to the truth that day. Be|fore we parted, I told them. <Q>If the Lord would, I intend|ed to be at the town again that day &s;even-night.</Q> In the interim I went into the country, had meetings, and came again that day &s;even-night. Again&s;t that time this prie&s;t had got &s;even prie&s;ts to help him; for he had given notice at a lecture on a market-day at Adder&s;ton, that &s;uch a day there would be a meeting and a di&s;pute with me. I knew nothing of it; but only had &s;aid I &s;hould be in town that day &s;even-night again. The&s;e eight prie&s;ts had gathered &s;everal hundreds of people, even mo&s;t of the country there|abouts, and would have had me into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e. I refu&s;ed to go in, and got on a hill, and there &s;poke to them and the people. Thomas Taylor, James Parnel, and &s;e|veral other friends were with me. The prie&s;ts thought that day to have trampled down truth; but the truth came over them. Then they grew light and the people rude. The prie&s;ts would not &s;tand trial with me; but would be con|tending here and there a little with one friend or other. At la&s;t one of the prie&s;ts brought his &s;on to di&s;pute with me; but his mouth was &s;oon &s;topt. When he could not tell how to an&s;wer, he would a&s;k his father, and his father was confounded al&s;o when he came to an&s;wer for his &s;on. So after they had toiled them&s;elves, they went in a rage to
<PB N="163" REF="037441_0240_100D8F4DBA1867F0">prie&s;t Stephens's hou&s;e to drink. As they went away I &s;aid, <Q>I never came to a place where &s;o many prie&s;ts toge|ther would not &s;tand the trial with me.</Q> Whereupon they and &s;ome of their wives came about me, laid hold of me, and fawningly &s;aid, <Q>What might I have been, if it had not been for the Quakers?</Q> Then they fell a pu&s;hing of friends to and fro, to thru&s;t them from me, and to pluck me to them&s;elves. After awhile &s;everal lu&s;ty fellows came, took me up in their arms, and carried me into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e porch, intending to have carried me into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e by force; but the door being locked, they fell down on an heap, having me under them. As &s;oon as I could I got from them to my hill again: then they got me from that place, took me to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e wall, and &s;et me on a ba&s;s like a &s;tool; and all the prie&s;ts, being come back, &s;tood under with the people. The prie&s;s cried, Come, to argument, to argument. I &s;aid, <Q>I denied all their voices, for they were the voices of hirelings and &s;trangers.</Q> They cried, Prove it, prove it. I directed them to the tenth of John, where they might &s;ee what Chri&s;t &s;aid of &s;uch; he declared, <Q>He was the true Shepherd that laid down his life for his &s;heep, and his &s;heep heard his voice and fol|lowed him; but the hireling would fly when the wolf came, becau&s;e he was an hireling.</Q> I offered to prove that they were &s;uch hirelings. Then the prie&s;ts plucked me off from the ba&s;s again, and them&s;elves got all upon ba&s;&s;es under the &s;teeple-hou&s;e wall. Then I felt the mighty power of God ari&s;e over all, and told them, <Q>If they would give audience, and hear me quietly, I would &s;hew them by the &s;criptures why I denied tho&s;e eight prie&s;ts or teachers that &s;tood before me, and all the hireling teachers of the world what&s;oever, and I would give them &s;criptures for what I &s;aid.</Q> Whereupon both prie&s;ts and people con&s;ented. Then I &s;hewed them out of I&s;aiah, Jeremiah, Fzek&s;el, Micah, Malachi, and other prophets, that they were in the &s;teps of &s;uch as God &s;ent his true prophets to cry again&s;t; for, &s;aid I. <Q>You are &s;uch as the prophet Jere|miah cried again&s;t, chap. v. when he &s;aid, <Q>The prophets prophe&s;y fal&s;ely, and the prie&s;ts bear rule by their means;</Q> which he called an horrible filthy thing. You are &s;uch as u&s;ed their tongues, and &s;aid. Thus &s;aith the Lord, when the Lord never &s;poke to them. Such as followed their own &s;pirits, and &s;aw nothing; but &s;poke a divination of their own brain: and by their lies and their lightne&s;s
<PB N="164" REF="037441_0241_100D8F50328D77A0">cau&s;ed the people to err, Jer. xiv. You are &s;uch as they were that &s;ought their gain from their quarter; that were as greedy dumb dogs, that could never have enough, whom the Lord &s;ent his prophet I&s;aiah to cry again&s;t, I&s;a. lvi. You are &s;uch as they were who taught for handfuls of barley and pieces of bread, who &s;ewed pillows under people's arm-holes, that they might lie &s;oft in their &s;ins. Ezek. xiii. You are &s;uch as they that taught for the fleece and the wool, and made a prey of the people, Ezek. xxxiv. But the Lord is gathering his &s;heep from your mouths, and from your barren mountain; and is bringing them to Chri&s;t, the one &s;hepherd, whom he hath &s;et over his flocks; as by his prophet Ezekiel he then declared he would do. You are &s;uch as tho&s;e that divined for money, and preached for hire; and if a man did not put into their, mouths they prepared war again&s;t him, as the prophet Micah complained, chap. iii.</Q> Thus I went through the prophets too largely to be here repeated. Then coming to the New Te&s;tament, I &s;hewed from thence, that <Q>that they were like the chief prie&s;ts, &s;cribes, and phari&s;ees, whom Chri&s;t cried wo again&s;t, Matth. xxiii. And that they were &s;uch fal&s;e apo&s;tles as the true apo&s;tles cried again&s;t, &s;uch as taught for filthy lucre; &s;uch antichri&s;ts and de|ceivers as they cried again&s;t, that minded earthly things, and &s;erved not the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but their own bel|lies: for they that &s;erved Chri&s;t gave freely and preached freely, as he commanded them. But they that will not preach without hire, tithes, or outward means, &s;erve their own bellies, and not Chri&s;t; and through the good words of the &s;criptures, and feigned words of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n, they made merchandize of the people then, as (&s;aid I) ye do now. When I had largely quoted the &s;criptures, and &s;hewed them wherein they were like the phari&s;ees, loving to be called of men ma&s;ters, to go in long robes, to &s;tand praying in the &s;ynagogues, to have the uppermo&s;t rooms at fea&s;ts and the like; and when I had thrown them out in the &s;ight to the people among&s;t the fal&s;e prophets, de|ceivers, &s;cribes, and phari&s;ees, and &s;hewed at large how &s;uch as they were judged and condemned by the true prophets, Chri&s;t, and the apo&s;stles, I directed them to the light of Je&s;us, who enlightens every man that cometh into the world; that by it they might &s;ee whether the&s;e things were not true as had been &s;poken.</Q> When I appealed to that of God in their con&s;ciences, the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us
<PB N="165" REF="037441_0242_100D8F52C2BD85D8">in them, they could not abide to hear it; they were all quiet till then; but then a profe&s;&s;or &s;aid, George, what! wilt thou never have done? I told him, I &s;hould have done &s;hortly. I went on a little longer, and cleared my&s;elf of them in the Lord's power. When I had done, all the prie&s;ts and people &s;tood &s;ilent for a time; at la&s;t one of the prie&s;ts &s;aid, They would read the &s;criptures that. I had quoted. I told them, with all my heart. They began to read the twenty-third of Jeremiah, where they &s;aw the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rks of the fal&s;e prophets that he cried again&s;t. When the had read a ver&s;e or two, I &s;aid, Take notice, people; but the prie&s;ts &s;aid, Hold thy tongue, George. I bid them read the whole chapter throughout. for it was all again&s;t them. Then they &s;topt, and would read no further; but a&s;ked me a que&s;tion. I told them I would an&s;wer their que&s;tion the matter being fir&s;t granted that I had charged them with, viz that they were fal&s;e prophets, fal&s;e teachers, antichri&s;ts, and deceivers, &s;uch as the true prophets, Chri&s;t, and the apo&s;tles cried again&s;t. A profe&s;&s;or &s;aid Nay to that; but I &s;aid, <Q>Yea: for you leaving the matter, and going to another thing, &s;eem to con&s;ent to the proof of the former charge.</Q> Then I an&s;wered their que&s;tion, which was this; <Q>Seeing tho&s;e fal&s;e prophets were adulte|rated, Whether I did judge prie&s;t Stephens to be an adulterer?</Q> To which I an&s;wered, <Q>He was adulterated from God in his practice, like tho&s;e fal&s;e prophets and the Jews.</Q> They would not &s;tand to vindicate him, but broke up the meeting. Then the prie&s;ts whi&s;pered together; and Stephens came to me, and de&s;ired that my father, brother, and I might go a&s;ide with him, that he might &s;peak to me in private, and the re&s;t of the prie&s;ts &s;hould keep the peo|ple from coming to us. I was very loth to go a&s;ide with him; but the people cried, <Q>Go, George; do, George, go a&s;ide with him.</Q> Being afraid, if I did not go, they would &s;ay I was di&s;obedient to my parents, I went, and the re&s;t of the prie&s;ts were to keep the people off; but they could not, for the people, being willing to hear, drew clo&s;e to us. I a&s;ked the prie&s;t, what he had to &s;ay? He &s;aid, <Q>If he was out of the way I &s;hould pray for him, and if I was out of the way he would pray for me; and he would give me a form of words to pray for him by?</Q> I replied, <Q>It &s;eems thou do&s;t not know whether thou bee&s;t in the right way or no; neither do&s;t thou know whether I am in the right way or no; but I know that I am in the ever|la&s;ting
<PB N="166" REF="037441_0243_100D8F54561682B0">way. Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which thou art out of. Thou would&s;t give me a form of words to pray by yet thou de|nie&s;t the Common Prayer Book to pray by as well as I, and I deny thy form of words as well as it. If thou would&s;t have me pray for thee by a form of words, is not this to deny the apo&s;tle's doctrine and practice of praying by the Spirit, as it gave words and utterance?</Q> Here the people fell a laughing; but I was moved to &s;peak more to him. And when I had cleared my&s;elf to him and them we parted, after I had told them, that I &s;hould, God willing, be in town that day &s;even-night again. So the prie&s;ts pack'd away, and many people were convinced that day; for the Lord's power came over all. Many that were con|vinced before, were by that day's work confirmed in the truth, and abode in it: and a great &s;hake it gave to the prie&s;ts. Yea, my father, though a hearer and follower of the prie&s;t, was &s;o well &s;atisfied, that he &s;truck his cane up|on the ground, and &s;aid, <Q>Truly I &s;ee, he that will but &s;tand to the truth, it will bear him out.</Q> I pa&s;&s;ed about in the country till that day &s;even-night, and then came a|gain: for we had appointed a meeting at my relations hou&s;e. Prie&s;t Stephens, having notice beforehand thereof, had got another prie&s;t to him. They had a company of troopers with them; and &s;ent for me to come to them. But I &s;ent them word, our meeting was appointed, and they might come to it if they would. The prie&s;ts came not; but the troopers came, and many rude people. They had laid their plot, That the troopers &s;hould take every one's name, and then command them to go home; and &s;uch as would not go, they &s;hould take, and carry away with them. Accord|ingly they began, and took &s;everal names, charging them to go home; but when they came to take my name, my rela|tions told them I was at home already: &s;o they could not take me away that time. Neverthele&s;s they took my name; but the Lord's power was over them, and they went away, both profe&s;&s;ors and troopers, cro&s;&s;ed and vexed becau&s;e they had not their ends. But &s;everal were convinced that day, and admired the love and power of God. This was that prie&s;t Stephens, who once &s;aid of me, <Q>Never &s;uch a plant was bred in England:</Q> yet afterwards he reported, <Q>That I was carried up into the clouds, and found again full of gold and &s;ilver;</Q> and many fal&s;e reports he rai&s;ed on me, but the Lord &s;wept them all away. The rea&s;on why I would not go into their &s;teeple-hou&s;e was, becau&s;e I
<PB N="167" REF="037441_0244_100D8F55F14E21A0">was to bear my te&s;timony again&s;t it, and to bring all off from &s;uch places to the Spirit of God; that they might know their bodies to be the temples of the Holy Gho&s;t; and to bring them off from all the hireling teachers to Chri&s;t, their free teacher, who died for them, and purcha&s;ed them with his blood.</P>
<P>After this I went into the country, had &s;everal meet|ings, and came to Swanington, where the &s;oldiers came; but the meeting was quiet, the Lord's power was over all, and the &s;oldiers did not meddle. Then I went to Lei|ce&s;ter, and from Leice&s;ter to Whet&s;tone. There came about &s;eventeen troopers of colonel Hacker's regiment, with his mar&s;hal, and took me up before the meeting, though friends were beginning to gather together; for there were &s;everal friends from divers parts. I told the mar&s;hal, <Q>He might let all the friends go, I would an&s;wer for them all.</Q> Whereupon he took me, and let all the friends go; only Alexander Parker went along with me. At night they had me before colonel Hacker, his major, and captains, a great company of them; and a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e we had about the prie&s;ts, and about meetings; for at this time there was a noi&s;e of a plot again&s;t O. Cromwel. Much rea&s;on|ing I had with them about the light of Chri&s;t, which en|lighteneth every man that cometh into the world. Col. Hacker a&s;ked, Whether it was not this light of Chri&s;t that made Judas betray his ma&s;ter, and after led him to hang him&s;elf? I told him, <Q>No: that was the &s;pirit of dark|ne&s;s, which hated Chri&s;t and his light.</Q> Then col. Hacker &s;aid, I might go home, and keep at home; and not go abroad to meetings. I told him, <Q>I was an innocent man, free from plots, and denied all &s;uch work.</Q> His &s;on Need|ham &s;aid, <Q>Father, this man hath reigned too long; it is time to have him cut off.</Q> I a&s;ked him, <Q>For what? What had I done? or whom had I wronged from a child? for I was bred and born in that country, and who could accu&s;e me of any evil from a child?</Q> Col. Hacker a&s;ked me again, If I would go home, and &s;tay at home? I told him, <Q>If I &s;hould promi&s;e him &s;o, it would manife&s;t that I was guilty of &s;omething, to make my home a pri&s;on: and if I went to meetings, they would &s;ay I broke their order. Therefore I told them, I &s;hould go to meetings, as the Lord &s;hould order me; and could not &s;ubmit to their requirings: but I &s;aid, we were a peaceable people.</Q> 'Well then,' &s;aid colonel Hacker, <Q>I will &s;end you to|morrow
<PB N="168" REF="037441_0245_100D8F597B479150">morning by &s;ix o'clock to my lord protector, by captain Drury, one of his life-guard.</Q> That night I was kept pri&s;oner at the Mar&s;hal&s;ea; and the next morning by the &s;ixth hour I was delivered to captain Drury. I de&s;ired he would let me &s;peak with colonel Hacker before I went; and he had me to his bed-&s;ide. Colonel Hacker &s;et upon me pre&s;ently again to go home, and keep no more meetings. I told him, <Q>I could not &s;ubmit to that; but mu&s;t have my liberty to &s;erve God, and to go to meetings.</Q> 'Then,' &s;aid he, 'you mu&s;t go before the protector.' Whereupon <Q>I kneeled on his bed-&s;ide, and be&s;ought the Lord to for|give him; for he was as Pilate, though he would wa&s;h his hands; and when the day of his mi&s;ery and trial &s;hould come upon him, I bid him, Then remember what I had &s;aid to him.</Q> But he was &s;tirred up and &s;et on by Ste|phens, and the other prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors, wherein their envy and ba&s;ene&s;s was manife&s;t; who, when they could not overcome me by di&s;putes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arguments, not re&s;i&s;t the Spi|rit of the Lord that was in me, they got &s;oldiers to take me up.</P>
<P>Afterwards, when colonel Hacker was impri&s;oned in Lon|don, a day or two before his execution, he was, put in mind of what he had done again&s;t the innocent; and he remem|bered it, and confe&s;&s;ed it to Margaret Fell; &s;aying, He knew well whom &s;he meant; and he had trouble upon him for it. So his &s;on, who had told, his father I had reigned too long, and it was time to have me cut off, might ob&s;erve how his father was cut off afterwards, he being hanged at Tyburn.</P>
<P>I was carried up pri&s;oner by captain Drury from Leice&s;|ter; and when we came to Harborough, he a&s;ked me, If I would go home, and &s;tay a fortnight? I &s;hould have my liberty, he &s;aid, if I would not go to nor keep meetings. I told him, I could not promi&s;e any &s;uch thing. Several times upon the road did he a&s;k, and try me after the &s;ame manner; and &s;till I gave him the &s;ame an&s;wers. So he brought me to London, and lodged me at the Mermaid over again&s;t the Mews at Charing-Cro&s;s. As we travelled, I was moved of the Lord to warn people at the inns and places, where I came, of the day of the Lord that was coming upon them. William Dew&s;bury and Marmaduke Storr being in pri&s;on at Northampton, he let me go and vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>After captain Drury had lodged me at the Mermaid, he
<PB N="169" REF="037441_0246_100D8F5B86CA8680">went to give the protector an account of me. When he came to me again, he told me, The prorector required that I &s;hould promi&s;e not to take up a carnal &s;word or weapon again&s;t him or the government, as it then was; and that I &s;hould write it in what words I &s;aw good, and &s;et my hand to it. I &s;aid little in reply to captain Drury. But the next morning I was moved of the Lord to write a paper <Q>To the protector, by the name of Oliver Cromwel; wherein I did in the pre&s;ence of the Lord God declare, that I did deny the wearing or drawing of a carnal &s;word, or any other outward weapon, again&s;t him or any man. And that I was &s;ent of God to &s;tand a witne&s;s a|gain&s;t all violence, and again&s;t the works of darkne&s;s; and to turn people from darkne&s;s to light; to bring them from the occa&s;ion of war and fighting to the peaceable go&s;pel; and from being evil-doers, which the magi&s;trates &s;word &s;hould be a terror to.</Q> Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> I had written what the Lord had given me to write, I &s;et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y name to it, and gave it to captain Drury to hand to O. Cromwel; which he did. Af|ter &s;ome time captain Drury brought me before the protect|or him&s;elf at Whitehall. It was in a morning, before he was dre&s;&s;ed; and one Harvey, who had come a little among friends, but was di&s;obedient, waited upon him. When I came in, I was moved to &s;ay, <Q>Peace be in this hou&s;e: and I exhorted him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o keep in the fear of God, that he might receive wi&s;dom from him; that by it he might be ordered, and with it might order all things under his hand unto God's glory.</Q> I &s;poke much to him of truth; and a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e I had with him about religion: wherein he carried him&s;elf very moderately. But he &s;aid, We quarrelled with the prie&s;ts, whom he called mini&s;ters. I told him, <Q>I did not quarrel with them, they quarrelled with me and my friends. But, &s;aid I, if we own the prophets, Chri&s;t, and the apo&s;tles, we cannot hold up &s;uch teachers, prophets, and &s;hepherds, as the prophets, Chri&s;t, and the apo&s;tles declared again&s;t; but we mu&s;t declare again&s;t them by the &s;ame power and Spirit. Then I &s;hewed him, That the prophets, Chri&s;t, and the apo&s;|tles declared freely, and declared again&s;t them that did not declare freely; &s;uch as preached for filthy lucre, divined for money, and preached for hire, and were covetous and greedy, like the dumb dogs that could never have enough: and that they, who have the &s;ame Spirit that Chri&s;t and the prophets, and the apo&s;tles had, could not but declare
<PB N="170" REF="037441_0247_100D8F5D1B303C50">again&s;t all &s;uch now, as they did then.</Q> As I &s;poke he &s;everal times &s;aid, It was very good, and it was truth. <Q>I told him, That all Chri&s;tendom (&s;o called) had the &s;crip|tures but they wanted the power and Spirit that tho&s;e had who gave forth the &s;criptures; and that was the rea&s;on they were not in fellow&s;hip with the Son, nor with the Father, nor with the &s;criptures, nor one with another.</Q> Many more words I had with him; but people coming in, I drew a little back. As I was turning, he catched me by the hand, and with tears in his eyes, &s;aid, Come again to <Q>my hou&s;e; for if thou and I were but an hour of a day together, we &s;hould be nearer one to the other;</Q> adding, That he wi&s;hed me no more ill than he did to his own &s;oul. I told him, <Q>If he did, he wronged his own &s;oul; and ad|moni&s;hed him to hearken to God's voice, that he might &s;tand in his coun&s;el, and obey it; and if he did &s;o, that would keep him from har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;s of heart: but if he did not hear God's volce, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">art would be hardened.</Q> He &s;aid, It was true. Then I went out; and when captain Drury came out after me, he told me, His lord protector &s;aid, I was at liberty, and might go whither I would. Then I was brought into a great hall, where the protector's gentle|men were to dine. I a&s;ked them, What they brought me thither for? They &s;aid, It was by the protector's order, that I might dine with them. I bid them let the protector know, I would not eat of his bread, nor drink of his drink. When he heard this, he &s;aid, <Q>Now I &s;ee there is a people ri&s;en, that I cannot win either with gifts, honours, offices or places; but all other &s;ects and people I can.</Q> It was told him again, <Q>That we had for&s;ook our own; and were not like to look for &s;uch things from him.</Q></P>
<P>Being &s;et at liberty, I went to the inn where captain Drury at fir&s;t lodged me. This captain, though he &s;ome|times carried it fairly, was an enemy to me and to truth, and oppo&s;ed it. When profe&s;&s;ors came to me, while I was under his cu&s;tody, and he was by, he would &s;coff at trem|bling, and call us Quakers, as the Independents and Pre&s;|byterians had nicknamed us before. But afterwards he came and told me, That, as he was lying on his bed to re&s;t him|&s;elf in the day-time, a &s;udden trembling &s;eized on him, that his joints knocked together; and his body &s;hook &s;o that he could not ri&s;e from his bed: he was &s;o &s;haken, that he had not &s;trength enough left to ri&s;e. But he felt the power of the Lord was upon him; and he tumbled off his bed, and
<PB N="171" REF="037441_0248_100D8F5EC885EA50">cried to the Lord, and &s;aid, He would never &s;peak again&s;t the Quakers more, &s;uch as trembled at the word of God.</P>
<P>During the time I was pri&s;oner at Charing-Cro&s;s, there came abundance to &s;ee me, almo&s;t of all &s;orts, prie&s;ts, pro|fe&s;&s;ors, officers of the army, &amp;c. Once a company of officers being with me, de&s;ired me to pray with them. I &s;at &s;till, with my mind retired to the Lord. At la&s;t I felt the power and Spirit of God move in me; and the Lord's power did &s;o &s;hake and &s;hatter them, that they wondered, though they did not live in it.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e that came was colonel Packer, with &s;everal of his officers. While they were with me, came in one Cob. and a great company of Ranters with him. The Ranters began to call for drink and tobacco; but I de&s;ired them to forbear it in my room, telling them, <Q>If they had &s;uch a mind to it, they might go into another room.</Q> One of them cried, 'All is ours:' and another of them &s;aid, 'All is well.' I replied, <Q>How is all well, while thou art &s;o peevi&s;h, envious, and crabbed?</Q> for I &s;aw he was of a peevi&s;h nature. I &s;pake to their conditions, and they were &s;en&s;ible of it, and looked one upon another, won|dering.</P>
<P>Then colonel Packer began to talk with a light, chaffy mind, concerning God, Chri&s;t, and the &s;criptures: it was a great grief to my &s;oul and &s;pirit, when I heard him talk &s;o lightly; &s;o that I told him, <Q>He was too light to talk of the things of God: for he did not know the &s;olidity of a man.</Q> Thereupon the officers raged, and &s;aid, Would I &s;ay &s;o of their colonel? Packer was a Bapti&s;t: he and the Ranters bowed and &s;craped to one another very much; for it was the manner of the Ranters to be exceeding compli|mental, &s;o that Packer bid them give over their compli|ments; but I told them, <Q>They were fit to go together, for they were both of one &s;pirit.</Q></P>
<P>This colonel lived at Theobalds near Waltham, and was made a ju&s;tice of peace. He &s;et up a great meeting of the Bapti&s;ts at Theobalds Park; for he and &s;ome other officers had purcha&s;ed it. They were exceeding high, railed again&s;t friends and truth; and threatened to apprehend me with their warrants, if ever I came there. Yet after I was &s;et at liberty, I was moved of the Lord to go to Theobalds, and appoint a meeting hard-by them; to which many of his people came, and divers of his hearers were convinced of the way of truth, received Chri&s;t the free teacher, and
<PB N="172" REF="037441_0249_100D8F60C39E6828">came off from the Bapti&s;t; which made him rage the more. But the Lord's power came over him &s;o, that he was not able to meddle with me. Then I went to Waltham, hard|by him, and had a meeting there. The people were very rude, gathered about the hou&s;e, and broke the windows. Whereupon I went out to them, with the bible in my hand, de&s;ired them to come in; and told them, <Q>I would &s;hew them &s;cripture both for our principles and practices.</Q> When I had done &s;o, I &s;hewed them al&s;o <Q>that their teach|ers were in the &s;teps of &s;uch as the prophets, Chri&s;t, and the apo&s;tles cried again&s;t. I directed them to the light of Chri&s;t, the Spirit of God in their own hearts; that by it they might come to know their free teacher, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> The meeting being ended, they went away quieted and &s;atisfied; and a meeting hath &s;ince been &s;ettled in that town. But this was &s;ome time after I was &s;et at liberty by O. Cromwel.</P>
<P>When I came from Whitehall to the Mermaid at Cha|ring-Cro&s;s, I &s;taid not long there: but went into the city of London, where we had great and powerful meetings; &s;o great were the throngs of people, that I could hardly get to and from the meetings for the crowds; and the truth &s;pread exceedingly. T. Aldam and R. Craven, who had been &s;heriffs of Lincoln, and divers friends, came up to London after me: but A. Parker abode with me.</P>
<P>After awhile I went to Whitehall again, and was moved to declare <Q>the day of the Lord among&s;t them; and that the Lord was come to teach his people him&s;elf:</Q> &s;o I preached truth both to the officers, and to them that were called Oliver's gentlemen, who were of his guard. But a prie&s;t oppo&s;ed, while I declared the word of the Lord among&s;t them: for Oliver had &s;everal about him, of which this was his news-monger; an envious prie&s;t, a light, &s;corn|ful, chaffy man. I bid him repent; and he put it in his news-paper the next week, that I had been at Whitehall, and had bid a godly mini&s;ter there repent. When I went thither again, I met with him; and abundance of people gathered about me. I manife&s;ted the prie&s;t to be a liar in &s;everal things that he had affirmed; and he was put to &s;ilence. He put in the news, that I wore &s;ilver buttons; which was fal&s;e; for they were but ochimy. Afterwards he put in the news, that I hung ribands on people's arms, which made them follow me. This was another of his lies; for I never u&s;ed nor wore ribands in my life. Three
<PB N="173" REF="037441_0250_100D8F63AE903A20">friends went to examine this prie&s;t, that gave forth this fal&s;e intelligence; and to know of him where he had that infor|mation? He &s;aid, It was a woman that told him &s;o; and if they would come again, he would tell them the woman's name. When they came again, he &s;aid, It was a man, but would not tell them his name then; but if they would come again, he would tell them his name, and where he lived. They went the third time; and then he would not &s;ay who told him; but offered, if I would give it under my hand that there was no &s;uch thing, he would put that into the news. Thereupon the friends carried it to him under my hand; but when they came, he broke his promi&s;e, and would not put it in: but was in a rage, and threatened them with the con&s;table. This was the deceitful doing of this forger of lies: and the&s;e lies he &s;pread over the nation in the news, to render truth odious, and to put evil into people's minds again&s;t friends and truth: of which a more large account may be &s;een in a book printed &s;oon after this time, for the clearing of friends and truth from the &s;landers and fal&s;e reports rai&s;ed and ca&s;t upon them. The&s;e prie&s;ts, the news-mongers, were of the independent &s;ect, like them in Leice&s;ter; but the Lord's power came over all their lies, and &s;wept them away; and many came to &s;ee the naughti|ne&s;s of the&s;e prie&s;ts. The God of heaven earried me over all in his power, and his ble&s;&s;ed power went over the na|tion; in&s;omuch that many friends about this time were moved to go up and down, to found forth the everla&s;ting go&s;pel in mo&s;t parts of this nation, and al&s;o in Scotland; and the glory of the Lord was felt over all to his everla&s;ting prai&s;e. A great convincement there was in London; &s;ome in the protector's hou&s;e and family. I went to have &s;een him again, but could not get to him, the officers were grown &s;o rude.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;byterians, Independents, and Bapti&s;ts were greatly di&s;turbed; for many of their people turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;at down under his teachings, received his power, and felt it in their hearts; and then they were moved of the Lord to declare again&s;t the re&s;t of them.</P>
<P>I appointed a meeting in the fields near Acton, in which the word of life, the &s;aving truth was declared &s;reely. The Lord's power was eminently manife&s;ted, and his ble&s;&s;ed day exalted over all.</P>
<P>About this time I was moved to write a paper, and &s;end it among the profe&s;&s;ors, on this wi&s;e:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>To all profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL tho&s;e that profe&s;&s;ed Je&s;us Chri&s;t in words, and yet heard him not when he was come, &s;aid, he was a deceiver and a devil. The chief prie&s;ts called him &s;o. The Jews &s;aid, <Q>He hath a devil and is mad; why do ye hear him?</Q> But others &s;aid, <Q>The&s;e are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</Q> The Jews then doubted whether he was the Chri&s;t, or no. So all, like the Jews, in the knowledge, in the notion, that profe&s;s Chri&s;t without only, where he is ri&s;en within, do not own him, but doubt of him; though Chri&s;t be the &s;ame now and for ever. He &s;aid, <Q>I and my Father are one; then the Jews took up &s;tones to &s;tone him;</Q> and where Je&s;us Chri&s;t is now &s;pi|ritually come and made manife&s;t, &s;uch as are chri&s;tians in outward profe&s;&s;ion only, have the &s;ame hard hearts in|wardly now as the Jews had then; and ca&s;t &s;tones at him, where he is ri&s;en. Je&s;us &s;aid, <Q>For which of the&s;e good works do ye &s;tone me?</Q> The Jews an&s;wered, <Q>For thy good works we &s;tone thee not; but for bla&s;phemy, in that thou being a man, make&s;t thy&s;elf God.</Q> Je&s;us an&s;wered 'them, <Q>Is it not written in your law, I &s;aid you are gods? and the &s;cripture cannot be broken. Say ye of him, whom the Father hath &s;anctified and &s;ent into the world, Thou bla&s;pheme&s;t, becau&s;e I &s;aid, I am the Son of God? The Jews &s;aid to him, Say we not well, that thou ha&s;t a devil? Je&s;us an&s;wered, I honour my Father, and ye di&s;honour me. And they that were in the &s;yna|gogue ro&s;e up, and thru&s;t him out of the city; and took him up to the edge of the hill whereon their city was built, to ca&s;t him down headlong. The Phari&s;ees &s;aid, He ca&s;teth out devils by the prince of devils.</Q> Chri&s;t was called a glutton and a wine-bibber; a friend of pub|licans and &s;inners; but wi&s;dom is ju&s;tified of her children. The officers, when the high-prie&s;ts and Phari&s;ees a&s;ked them, "Why have ye not brought him?" &s;aid <Q>Never man &s;pake like this man.</Q> The Phari&s;ees &s;aid, <Q>Are you al&s;o deceived? Do any of the rulers or of the Pha|ri&s;ees believe on him? but this people, which know not the law, are accur&s;ed. Nicodemus &s;aid unto them (he that came unto Je&s;us by night) doth our law judge any man before it hear him?</Q> When Stephen confe&s;&s;ed Je|&s;us, the &s;ub&s;tance of all figures and types, and was
<PB N="175" REF="037441_0252_100D8F67AE9041F0">brought before the chief prie&s;ts to his trial, he told them, <Q>The Mo&s;t High dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</Q> and brought the prophets words to witne&s;s, and told them, They were &s;tiff-necked and uncircumci&s;ed in heart and ears, and always re&s;i&s;ted the Holy Gho&s;t, as their fathers had done. Stephen was full of the Holy Gho&s;t, and &s;aid, He &s;aw Je&s;us; and they ran upon him, and &s;toned him to death, as he was calling upon the Lord. When Paul confe&s;&s;ed Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Re&s;urrection, Fe&s;tus &s;aid, He was mad. When Paul preached the re&s;ur|rection, &s;ome mocked. The Jews per&s;uaded the people, and they &s;toned him, and drew him out of the city, think|ing he had been dead. The Jews &s;tirred up the Gentiles, to make their minds evil-affected towards the brethren. The Jews &s;tirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief of the city: and rai&s;ed per&s;ecution again&s;t Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coa&s;ts: and there was an a&s;&s;ault made both of the Gentiles and of the Jews, with their rulers, to u&s;e them de&s;pitefully, and to &s;tone them. In like manner all in the nature of tho&s;e Jews now, who&s;e religion &s;tands in notions, &s;tir up the rulers and the ignorant people, and incen&s;e them again&s;t Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to &s;tone all with one con&s;ent in whom he is ri&s;en. This is, that the &s;cripture might be fulfilled, and the blindne&s;s of the people might be di&s;covered. The &s;ame power now is made manife&s;t, and doth overturn the world, as did then overturn the world, to the exalting of the Lord, and the pulling down of the kingdom of Satan and of this world, and &s;etting up his own kingdom, to his everla&s;ting prai&s;e. The Lord is now exalting him&s;elf, and throwing down man's &s;elf. The proud one's head is aloft, fearing he &s;hould lo&s;e his pride and his crown. The prie&s;ts incen&s;e the ignorant people, for fear their trade &s;hould go down; and profe&s;&s;ors &s;hew forth what is in them, being full of rage; which &s;hews that Je&s;us Chri&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance is not there; but a &s;tony heart, to &s;tone the precious, where it is ri&s;en. The carnal mind feeds upon the outward letter; earth feeds upon earth; and that vine|yard is not dre&s;&s;ed, but is full of briers and nettles; and ravenous bea&s;ts, &s;wine, dogs, wolves, and lions, and all venomous creatures lodge in that habitation. That hou&s;e is not &s;wept. The&s;e are the per&s;ecutors of the ju&s;t, ene|mies of the truth, and of Chri&s;t. The&s;e are bla&s;phemers of God and his truth. The&s;e call upon God with their
<PB N="176" REF="037441_0253_100D8F6A5DD1F4F8">lips, but their hearts are far from him. The&s;e feed on lies; prie&s;ts and people. The&s;e incen&s;e the people, and &s;tir up envy; for it begets its own, one like it&s;elf. The&s;e are as the waves of the &s;ea, foaming out their own &s;hame. The&s;e have double eyes; who&s;e bodies are full of dark|ne&s;s. The&s;e paint them&s;elves with the prophets, with Chri&s;t's, and with the apo&s;tles words mo&s;t fair. Whited walls, painted &s;epulchres, murderers of the ju&s;t you are, Your eyes are double, your minds are double, your hearts are double. Ye flatterers, repent and turn from your carnal ends, who are full of mi&s;chief; pretending God and godline&s;s, taking him for your cloak; but he will un|cover you, and he hath uncovered you to his children. He will make you bare, di&s;cover your &s;ecrets, take off your crown, take away your mantle and your veil, and &s;trip you of your cloathing; that your nakedne&s;s may ap|pear, and how you &s;it deceiving the nations. Your abo|mination and your fal&s;ehood is now made manife&s;t to tho&s;e who are of God; who in his power triumph over you, re|joice over you, the bea&s;t, the dragon, the fal&s;e prophet, the &s;educer, the hypocrite, the mother of all harlots. Now thou mu&s;t have thy cup double. Give it to her double. Sing over her, ye righteous ones, &s;ing over them all, ye &s;aints; triumph in glory, triumph over the deceit: &s;ing the &s;ong of the lamb; triumph over the world, &s;pread the truth abroad. Come ye captives out of pri&s;on; rejoice with one accord, for the joyful days are coming. Let us be glad, and rejoice for ever! Singlene&s;s of heart is come; purene&s;s of heart is come; joy and gladne&s;s is come. The glorious God is exalting him&s;elf: truth hath been talked of, but now it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Chri&s;t hath been talked of; but now he is come and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The glory hath been talked of; but now it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the glory of man is defacing. The Son of God hath been talked of; but now he is come, and hath given us an under&s;tanding. Unity hath been talked of; but now it is come. Virgins have been talked of; but now they are come with oil in their lamps. He will be glorified alone. Where pride is thrown down, earth and the fle&s;hly will is thrown down, and the pure is rai&s;ed up; there alone is the Lord exalted. Let the heavens bow down to him, and the earth reel to and fro, and &s;tagger up and down. The Lord is &s;etting up his throne and his crown, and throwing down the crown of man; he alone will be glorified: to whom be

He gives his children wi&s;dom and &s;trength, knowledge and virtue, power and riches, ble&s;&s;ings and durable &s;ub&s;tance; an eye to di&s;cern, and an ear to hear things &s;ingly; brings down the pride of man's heart, and turns the wicked out of the kingdom. The righteous inherit righteou&s;ne&s;s; the pure, purene&s;s; the holy, holine&s;s. Prai&s;es, prai&s;es be to the Lord, who&s;e glory now &s;hines, who&s;e day is broken forth; which is hid from the world, hid from all worldly-wi&s;e ones, from all the prudent of this world; from the fowls of the air; from all vultures eyes, all venomous bea&s;ts, all liars, all dogs, and all &s;wine. But to them that fear his name, the &s;ecrets of the Lord are made manife&s;t, the trea|&s;ures of wi&s;dom are opened, and the fulne&s;s of knowledge: for thou, O Lord! do&s;t make thy&s;elf manife&s;t to thy children.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>To &s;uch as follow the world's fa&s;hions:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT a world is this! how doth the devil gar|ni&s;h him&s;elf! how obedient are people to do his will and mind! They are altogether carried away with fooleries and vanities, both men and women. They have lo&s;t the hidden man of the heart, the meek and quiet &s;pi|rit; which with the Lord is of great price. They have lo&s;t the adorning of Sarah; they are putting on gold and gay apparel; women plaiting the hair, men and women powdering it; making their backs look like bags of meal. They look &s;o &s;trange, that they can &s;carce look at one another; they are &s;o lifted up in pride. Pride is flown up into their head; and hath &s;o lifted them up, that they &s;nuff up, like wild a&s;&s;es, and like Ephraim: they feed upon wind, and are got to be like wild heifers, who feed upon the mountains. Pride hath puffed up every one of them. They are out of the fear of God; men and wo|men. Young and old; one puffs up another. They mu&s;t be in the fa&s;hion of the world, el&s;e they are not in e&s;teem; nay they &s;hall not be re&s;pected, if they have not gold or &s;ilver upon their backs, or if the hair be not
<PB N="178" REF="037441_0255_100D8F6E5099CD38">powdered. But if one have &s;tore of ribands hanging about his wai&s;t, at his knees, and in his hat, of divers colours, red, white, black, or yellow, and his hair pow|dered; then he is a brave man, then he is accepted, then he is no Quaker. He hath ribands on his back, belly, and knees, and his hair powdered. This is the array of the world. But is not this from the lu&s;t of the eye, the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, or the pride of life? Likewi&s;e the women having their gold, their patches on their faces, no&s;es, cheeks, foreheads, their rings on their fingers, wear|ing gold, their cuffs double under and above, like a butcher with his white &s;leeves; their ribands tied about their hands, and three or four gold laces about their cloaths; this is no Quaker, &s;ay they. This attire plea&s;eth the world; and if they cannot get the&s;e things, they are di&s;contented. But this is not the attire of Sarah, who&s;e adorning was in the hidden man of the heart, of a quiet and meek &s;pirit. This is the adorning of the heathen; not of the apo&s;tle, nor of the &s;aints, who&s;e adorning was, not wearing of gold, nor plaiting of hair, but that of a meek and quiet &s;pirit, which is of great price with the Lord. Here was the &s;obriety and good ornament which was accepted of the Lord. This was Paul's exhortation and preaching. But we &s;ee, the talkers of Paul's words live out of Paul's command, and out of the example of Sarah, and are found in the &s;teps of the great heathen, who comes to examine the apo&s;tles in his gorgeous ap|parel. Are not the&s;e, that have got ribands hanging about their arms, hands, back, wai&s;ts, knees, hats, like fiddlers boys? This &s;hews, that they are got into the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t contemptible life, who are in the fa&s;hion of fiddlers boys and &s;tage-players, quite out of the paths and &s;teps of &s;olid men; in the very &s;teps and paths of the wild heads, who give them&s;elves up to every invention and vanity of the world that appears, and are inventing how to get it upon their backs, heads, feet, and legs; and &s;ay, If it be out of the fa&s;hion, it is nothing worth. Are not the&s;e &s;poilers of the creation, who have the fat and the be&s;t of it, and wa&s;te and de&s;troy it? Do not the&s;e incumber God's earth? Let that of God in all con&s;ciences an&s;wer, and who are in the wi&s;dom judge. And further; if one get a pair of breeches like a coat, and hang them about with points, and up almo&s;t to the middle, a pair of double cuffs upon his hands, and
<PB N="179" REF="037441_0256_100D8F6FEDA0B9A0">a feather in his cap, here's a gentleman; bow before him, put off your hats, get a company of fiddlers, a &s;et of mu|&s;ick, and women to dance. This is a brave fellow. Up in the chamber; up in the chamber without, and up in the chamber within. Are the&s;e your fine Chri&s;tians? Yea, &s;ay they, They are Chri&s;tians; but &s;ay the &s;erious people, They are out of Chri&s;t's life, out of the apo&s;tle's command, and out of the &s;aints ornament. To &s;ee &s;uch as are in the fa&s;hions of the world before-mentioned, a com|pany of them playing at bowls, or at tables, or at &s;hovel|board, or each taking his hor&s;e, with bunches of ribands on his head, as the rider hath on his own, perhaps a ring in his ear too, and &s;o go to hor&s;e-racing to &s;poil the crea|tures. Oh! the&s;e are gentlemen indeed, the&s;e are bred up gentlemen, the&s;e are brave fellows, they mu&s;t take their recreation; for plea&s;ures are lawful. The&s;e in their &s;ports, &s;et up their &s;houts like wild a&s;&s;es. They are like the kine or bea&s;ts, when they are put to gra&s;s, lowing when they are full. Here is the glorying of tho&s;e before-mentioned; but it is in the fle&s;h, not in the Lord. The&s;e are bad chri&s;tians, and &s;hew that they are gluttoned with the crea|tures, and then the fle&s;h rejoiceth. Here is evil breeding of youth and young women, who are carried away with the vanities of the mind in their own inventions, pride, arrogance, lu&s;t, gluttony, uncleanne&s;s. They eat and drink, and ri&s;e up to play. This is the generation which God is not well plea&s;ed with; for their eyes are full of a|dultery, who cannot cea&s;e from evil. The&s;e be they that live in plea&s;ures upon earth the&s;e be they who are dead while they live; who glory not in the Lord, but in the fle&s;h: the&s;e be they that are out of the life that the &s;crip|tures were given forth from, who live in the fa&s;hions and vanities of the world, out of truth's adorning in the devil's adorning (who is out of the truth) not in the adorning of the Lord, which is a meek and quiet &s;pirit, and is with the Lord of great price. But this ornament and this a|dorning is not put on by them that adorn them&s;elves, and have the ornament of him that is out of the truth. That is not accepted with the Lord which is accepted in their eye.</P>

<P>YE heads, rulers, kings, and nobles, of all &s;orts, Be not bitter, nor ha&s;ty in per&s;ecuting the lambs of Chri&s;t, neither turn your&s;elves again&s;t the vi&s;itation of God, and his tender love and mercies from on high, who &s;ent to vi&s;it you; le&s;t the Lord's hand, arm, and power take hold &s;wiftly upon you; which is now &s;tretched over the world.

The Lord will be king, who gives crowns to whom&s;oever obey his will. This is the age, wherein the Lord God of heaven and earth is &s;taining the pride of man and defacing his glory. You that profe&s;s Chri&s;t, and do not love your enemies, but on the contrary &s;hut up and impri&s;on tho&s;e who are his friends; the&s;e are marks that you are out of his life, and do not love Chri&s;t, who do not the things he com|mands. The day of the Lord's wrath is kindling, his fire is going forth to burn up the wicked, which will leave nei|ther root nor branch. They that have lo&s;t their habita|tion with God are out of his Spirit that gave forth the &s;criptures, and from the light that Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath enlight|ened them withal; and &s;o from the true foundation.

<P>Let this go to the kings of France and of Spain, and to the pope, for them to prove all things and to hold that which is good. And fir&s;t to prove, that they have not quenched the Spirit; for the mighty day of the Lord is come, and coming upon all wickedne&s;s, ungodline&s;s, and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men, who will plead with all fle&s;h by fire and by &s;word.

And if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be &s;uch as they di&s;approved, &s;ee how ye can &s;tand, approved in the &s;ight of God, to let &s;uch go into his vineyard, and approve of them who will admire your per&s;ons becau&s;e of advantage, and if you do not give them advantage they will not admire your per|&s;ons; &s;uch Jude &s;peaks of. See if they be not &s;uch as teach for filthy lucre, for love of money, covetous, &s;uch as love them&s;elves, who have a form of godline&s;s, but deny the power; from &s;uch the apo&s;tle bids, Turn away. The apo&s;tles &s;aid, their mouths &s;hould be &s;topped, who &s;erved not the Lord Je&s;us, but their own bellies; being evil bea&s;ts, flow bellies, who mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rthly things. Paul gave Timothy a de&s;cription to try mini&s;ters by: he &s;aid, They mu&s;t not be covetous, nor given to wine, nor filthy lucre, nor novices; le&s;t being lifted up into pride, they fall into
<PB N="182" REF="037441_0259_100D8F775AA85358">the condemnation of the devil. The&s;e he was to try and prove without partiality. Take heed of approving &s;uch as he di&s;approved; for &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, &s;uch as he di&s;approved have had their liberty; and they have told us, The tongues were their original, that they were ortho|dox men, and that the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, with a cro&s;s on the top of it, was the church (the Papi&s;ts ma&s;s-hou&s;e, you may look on the top of it and &s;ee the &s;ign.) But the &s;criptures tell us, <Q>All the earth was of one language before the building of Babel.</Q> And when Pilate cruci|fied Chri&s;t, he &s;et the tongues, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin over his head. And John tells us, that the bea&s;t had power over the tongues, kindreds and nations: and that the whore &s;its upon the tongues, of who&s;e cup all nations have drunk, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her. John al&s;o &s;aid, The tongues are waters. Chri&s;t gives marks to his di&s;ciples, and to the mul|titude, how to try &s;uch as the&s;e that you are to try. They are called of men ma&s;ter, they love the chiefe&s;t &s;eat in the a&s;&s;emblies, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ayers but not doers; and, &s;aid he, they &s;hall put you out of the &s;ynagogues. Seven woes he denounced again&s;t them, and therefore di&s;approved them. Chri&s;t &s;aid, Fal&s;e prophets &s;hould come; and John &s;aw, They were come: for they went forth from them; and the world &s;ince hath gone after them. But Babylon mu&s;t be confounded, the mother of harlots; and the devil mu&s;t be taken, and with him they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and the fal&s;e prophet mu&s;t be ca&s;t into the lake of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for the Lamb and his faints over all mu&s;t reign, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the victory. The Lord &s;ent his prophets of old to cry again&s;t the &s;hepherds that &s;ought for the fleece, Ezek. xxxiv. and to cry again&s;t &s;uch &s;hep|herds as &s;eck for their gain from their quarter, and never have enough, I&s;a. v. 6. and to cry again&s;t the prophets that prophe&s;ied fal&s;ely, and the prie&s;ts that bore rule by their means; which was the filthy and horrible thing, Jer. v. And if you would forbear to give them means, you would &s;ee how long they would bear rule. There was in old time a &s;torehou&s;e for the fatherle&s;s, &s;trangers, and widows, to come to and be filled; and tho&s;e did not pro&s;|per then who did not bring their tithes to the &s;torehou&s;e. But did not Chri&s;t put an end to that prie&s;thood, tithes, temple, and prie&s;ts? Doth not the apo&s;tle &s;ay, The prie&s;t|hood is changed, the law is changed, and the command|ment di&s;annulled? Might not they have pleaded the law
<PB N="183" REF="037441_0260_100D8F79DD096D08">of God, that gave them tithes? Was not the fir&s;t author of them &s;ince Chri&s;t's time the pope, or &s;ome of his church? Did the apo&s;tles ca&s;t men into pri&s;on for tithes, as your mini&s;ters do now? As in&s;tance: Ralph Holling|worth, prie&s;t of Phillingham, for petty tithes, not exceed|ing &s;ix &s;hillings, hath ca&s;t into Lincoln pri&s;on a poor thatcher, Thomas Bromby; where he hath been about eight and thirty weeks, and &s;till remains pri&s;oner: and the prie&s;t petitioned the judge, that the poor man might not labour in the city to get a little money towards his maintenance in pri&s;on. Is this a good &s;avour among&s;t you that are in commi&s;&s;ion to choo&s;e mini&s;ters? Is this glad ti|dings? to ca&s;t in pri&s;on a man that is not his hearer, be|cau&s;e he could not put into his mouth? Can &s;uch as are in the fear of God, and in his wi&s;dom, own &s;uch things? the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are to plant a vineyard, and then eat of the fruit; to plow, &s;ow, and thre&s;h, and get the corn; and then let them reap: but not ca&s;t them into pri&s;on for whom they do no work. Chri&s;t, when he &s;ent forth his mini&s;ters, bid them give freely as they had re|ceived freely; and into what city or town &s;oever they came, inquire who were worthy and there abide; and what they &s;et before you, &s;aid he, that eat. And when the&s;e came back again to Chri&s;t, and he a&s;ked them, If they wanted any thing? they &s;aid, No. They did not go to a town, and call the people together, to know how much they might have by the year, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the&s;e that are in the apo|&s;tacy do now. The apo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, Have I not power to eat and to drink? But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> not &s;ay, To take tithes, ea&s;ter-reckonings, mid&s;ummer-dues, augmentations, and great &s;ums of money; but have I not power to eat and to drink? Yet he did not u&s;e that power among the Corinthians. But they that are apo&s;tatized from him will take tithes, great &s;ums of money, ea&s;ter-reckonings, and mid&s;ummer-dues; and ca&s;t tho&s;e into pri&s;on that will not give it them, whom they do no work for. The ox's mouth mu&s;t not be muzzled that treads out the corn; but &s;ee if the corn be trodden out in you, and the wheat be in the garner? This is from a lover of your &s;ouls, and one that di&s;ires your eternal good.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After I had made &s;ome &s;tay in the city of London, I was moved of the Lord to go into bedford&s;hire to John
<PB N="184" REF="037441_0261_100D8F7BE8202FB0">Crook's; where there was a great meeting, and people ge|nerally convinced of the Lord's truth. When I was come thither. John Crook told me, that the next day &s;everal of tho&s;e called the gentlemen of the country would come to dine with him, and to di&s;cour&s;e with me. They came, and I declared to them God's eternal truth. Several friends went to the &s;teeple-hou&s;es that day. And there was a meet|ing in the country, which Alexander Parker went to; and towards the middle of the day it came upon me to go to it, though it was &s;everal miles off. John Crook went with me. When we came there, there was one&mdash;Gritton, who had been a Bapti&s;t, but he was got higher than they, and called him&s;elf a trier of &s;pirits. He u&s;ed to tell people their fortunes, and pretended to di&s;cover when goods were &s;tolen, or hou&s;es broken up, who the per&s;ons were that did it: by which he had got into the affections of many thereabouts. This man was in that meeting &s;peaking, and making an hi|deous noi&s;e over the young convinced friends, when I came in; and he bid Alexander Parker give a rea&s;on of his hope. Alexander Parker told him, Chri&s;t was his hope; but be|cau&s;e he did not an&s;wer him &s;o &s;oon as he expected, he boa&s;tingly cried, His mouth is &s;topped. Then Gritton directed his &s;peech to me; for I &s;tood &s;till and heard him expre&s;s many things not agreeable to &s;cripture. I a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether he could make tho&s;e things out by &s;crip|ture which he had &s;poken?</Q> He &s;aid, Yes, yes. Then I bid the people take out their bibles and &s;earch the places he &s;hould quote for proof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his a&s;&s;ertions; but he could not make good by &s;cripture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat he had &s;aid. So he was a&s;hamed, and fled out of the hou&s;e, and his people were generally convinced; for his &s;pirit was di&s;covered, and he came no more among&s;t them. When they were &s;ettled in God's truth, they publi&s;hed a book again&s;t him, denying his &s;pirit and his fal&s;e di&s;coveries. Many were turned to Chri&s;t that day, and came to &s;it under his teaching; in&s;o|much that the judges were in a great rage, and many of the magi&s;trates in Bedford&s;hire, becau&s;e &s;o many were turned from the hireling prie&s;ts to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t's free teaching. But John Crook was kept by the power of the Lord; yet he was di&s;charged from being a ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time I returned to London again; where friends were finely e&s;tabli&s;hed in the truth, and great com|ings-in there were. About this time &s;everal friends went beyond &s;ea, to declare the everla&s;ting truth of God. When
<PB N="185" REF="037441_0262_100D8F7E886A4FE8">I had &s;taid awhile in the city, I went into Kent. When we came into Roche&s;ter, there was a guard kept to examine pa&s;&s;engers; but we pa&s;&s;ed by, and were not &s;topped. So I went to Cranbrook, where there was a great meeting; &s;e|veral &s;oldiers were at it, and many were turned to the Lord that day. After the meeting &s;ome of the &s;oldiers were &s;omewhat rude; but the Lord's power came over them. Thomas How&s;igoe, an Independent preacher, who lived not far from Cranbrook, was convinced, and became a faith|ful mini&s;ter for the Lord Je&s;us. Some friends had travelled into Kent before, as John Stubbs and William Caton; and the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors had &s;tirred up the magi&s;trates at Maid&s;tone to whip them for declaring God's truth unto them; as may be &s;een in the journal of William Caton's life. Captain Dunk was al&s;o convinced in Kent. He went with me to Rye, where we had a meeting; to which the mayor, officers, and &s;everal captains came. They took what I &s;aid in writing, which I was well plea&s;ed with. All was quiet, and the people affected with the truth.</P>
<P>From Rye I went to Rumney, where the people had notice of my coming &s;ome time before. There was a very large meeting. Thither came Samuel Fi&s;her, an eminent preacher among the Bapti&s;ts, who had a par&s;onage reputed worth two hundred pounds a year; which for con&s;cience &s;ake he had given up. There was al&s;o the pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;ts, and abundance of their people. The power of the Lord was &s;o mightily over the meeting, that many were reached, and one greatly &s;haken; and the life &s;prang up in divers. One of the pa&s;tors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Bapti&s;ts, being amazed at the work of the Lord's power, bid one of our friends that was &s;o wrought upon, Have a good con&s;cience. Whereupon I was moved of the Lord to bid him, Take heed of hypocri&s;y and deceit; and he was &s;ilent. A great convincement there was that day. Many were turned from darkne&s;s to the divine light of Chri&s;t, and came to &s;ee their teachers errors, and to &s;it under the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t's teaching; to know him their way, and the covenant of light, which God had given to be their &s;alvation; and they were brought to the one Bapti&s;m, and to the one Bap|tizer, Chri&s;t Je&s;us. When the meeting was done, Samuel Fi&s;her's wife &s;aid, <Q>We may di&s;cern this day betwixt fle&s;h and Spirit, and di&s;tingui&s;h &s;piritual teaching from fle&s;hly.</Q> The people were generally well &s;atisfied with what had been declared; but the two Bapti&s;t teachers and their compa|ny,
<PB N="186" REF="037441_0263_100D8F801A2121F8">when they were gone from the meeting, fell to rea&s;on|ing among&s;t the people. Samuel Fi&s;her, with divers others, rea&s;oned for the word of life, which had been declared that day, and the other pa&s;tor and his party rea&s;oned again&s;t it; &s;o it divided them a&s;under and cut them in the mid&s;t. A friend came and told me, <Q>That the Bapti&s;ts were di&s;puting one with another, and de&s;ired me to go to them.</Q> I &s;aid, 'Let them alone, the Lord will divide them, and they that 'rea&s;on for truth will be too hard for the other: and &s;o it was. Samuel Fi&s;her received the truth in the love of it, became a faithful mini&s;ter, preached Chri&s;t freely, and la|boured much; being moved of the Lord to go and declare the word of life at Dunkirk, in Holland, and in divers parts of Italy, as Leghorn, and Rome it&s;elf; yet the Lord pre&s;erved him and his companion John Stubbs out of their inqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>From Rumney I pa&s;&s;ed to Dover, and had a meeting, where &s;everal were convinced. Near Dover a governor and his wife were convinced, who had been Bapti&s;ts. The Bap|ti&s;ts thereabouts were much offended, and grew very envi|ous; but the Lord's power came over all. Luke Howard of Dover was convinced &s;ome time before, and became a faithful mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Returning from Dover I went to Canterbury, where a few hone&s;t-hearted people were turned to the Lord; who &s;ate down under Chri&s;t's teaching. Thence I pa&s;&s;ed to Cranbrook again, where I had a great meeting. A friend went to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and was ca&s;t into pri&s;on; but the Lord's power was manif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ted, and his truth &s;pread.</P>
<P>From thence I pa&s;&s;ed into Su&s;&s;ex, and lodged near Hor&s;ham, where was a great meeting; and many con|vinced. Al&s;o at Steyning we had a great meeting in the market-hou&s;e, and &s;everal were convinced there and there|away; for the Lord's power was with us. Several meet|ings I had thereabouts; among&s;t the re&s;t a meeting was appointed at a great man's hou&s;e, and he and his &s;on went to fetch &s;everal prie&s;ts who had threatened to come and di&s;|pute. But none of them came, for the Lord's power was mighty in us. A glorious meeting we had. The man of the hou&s;e and his &s;on were vexed, becau&s;e none of the prie&s;ts would come. So the hearts of the people were opened by the Spirit of God, and they were turned from the hirelings to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, their &s;hepherd, who had pur|cha&s;ed them without money, and would &s;eed them without
<PB N="187" REF="037441_0264_100D8F81F29DA440">money or price. Many that came, expecting to hear a di&s;pute, were convinced; among&s;t whom Nicholas Beard was one.</P>
<P>Thus the Lord's power came over all, and his day many came to &s;ee. There were abundance of Ranters in tho&s;e parts, and profe&s;&s;ors, who had been &s;o loo&s;e in their lives that they began to be weary of them, and had thought to have gone into Scotland to have lived privately; but the Lord's net catched them, and their under&s;tandings were opened by his light, Spirit, and power, through which they came to receive the truth, and to be &s;ettled upon the Lord; and &s;o became very &s;ober men, and good friends in the truth. Great ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;ing the Lord there was among&s;t them, and great admiration in the country.</P>
<P>Out of Su&s;&s;ex I travelled till I came to Reading; where I found a few that were convinced of the way of the Lord. I &s;taid till the fir&s;t-day, and had a meeting in George Lam|boll's orchard; and a great part of the town came to it. A glorious meeting it proved; great convincement there was, and the people were mightily &s;atisfied. Thither came two of judge Fell's daughters to me, and George Bi&s;hop, of Bri&s;tol, with his &s;word by his &s;ide, for he was a captain. After the meeting many Bapti&s;ts and Ranters came privately, rea&s;oning and di&s;cour&s;ing; but the Lord's power came over them. The Ranters pleaded, that God made the devil: I denied it, and told them, <Q>I was come into the power of God, the &s;eed Chri&s;t, which was before the devil was, and brui&s;ed his head; and he became a de|vil by going out of truth; and &s;o became a murderer and a de&s;troyer. I &s;hewed them, that God did not make him a devil; for God is a God of truth, and made all things good, and ble&s;&s;ed them; but God did not ble&s;s the devil. And the devil is bad, and was a liar and a murderer from the beginning, and &s;poke of him&s;elf, and not from God.</Q> So the truth &s;topt and bound them, and came over all the highe&s;t notions in the nation, and confounded them. For by the power of the Lord I was manife&s;t, and &s;ought to be made manife&s;t to the Spirit of God in all, that by it they might be turned to God; as many were turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t by the holy Spirit, and were come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it under his teaching.</P>
<P>After this I pa&s;&s;ed to London, where I &s;taid awhile, and had large meetings: then went into E&s;&s;ex, and came to Cog&s;hall, where was a meeting of about two thou&s;and
<PB N="188" REF="037441_0265_100D8F84EEE0CB20">people, as it was judged, which la&s;ted &s;everal hours, and a glorious meeting it was; for the word of life was freely declared, and people were turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their teacher and Saviour, the way, the truth, and the life.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth-day I had a large meeting near Colche&s;ter, to which many profe&s;&s;ors and the Independent teachers came. After I had done &s;peaking, and was &s;tept down from the place on which I &s;tood, one of the Independent teachers began to make a jangling; which Amor Stoddart perceiv|ing, &s;aid, Stand up again, George; for I was going away, and did not at the fir&s;t hear them. But when I heard the Independent, I &s;tood up again, and after awhile the Lord's power came over him and his company; who were con|founded, and the Lord's truth went over all. A great flock of &s;heep hath the Lord in that country, that feed in his pa&s;tures of life. On the fir&s;t-day following we had a very large meeting not far from Colche&s;ter, wherein the Lord's power was eminently manife&s;ted, and the people were very well &s;atisfied; for being turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t's free teaching, they received it gladly. Many of the&s;e peo|ple were of the &s;tock of the martyrs.</P>
<P>As I pa&s;&s;ed through Colche&s;ter, I went to vi&s;it James Parnel in pri&s;on; but the gaoler would hardly let us come in, or &s;tay with him. Very cruel they were to him. The gaoler's wife threatened to have his blood; and in that gaol they did de&s;troy him, as the reader may &s;ee in a book printed &s;oon after his death, giving an account of his life and death; and al&s;o in an epi&s;tle printed with his collected books and writings.</P>
<P>From Colche&s;ter I went to Ip&s;wich, where we had a lit|tle meeting, and very rude; but the Lord's power came over them. After the meeting, I &s;aid, <Q>If any had a de&s;ire to hear further, they might come to the inn;</Q> and there came in a company of rude butchers that had abu&s;ed friends: but the Lord's power &s;o chained them they could not do mi&s;chief. Then I wrote a paper and gave it forth to the town, <Q>warning them of the day of the Lord, that they might repent of the evils they lived in; directing them to Chri&s;t, their teacher and way; and exhorting them to for&s;ake their hireling-teachers.</Q></P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed from Ip&s;wich to Mendle&s;ham, in Suffoll, where Robert Duncon lived. There we had a large meet|ing that was quiet, and the Lord's power was preciou&s;ly
<PB N="189" REF="037441_0266_100D8F870C7E5D40">felt among&s;t us. Then we pa&s;&s;ed to a meeting at captain Lawrence's, in Norfolk; where, it was judged, were above a thou&s;and people; and all was quiet. Many per&s;ons of note were pre&s;ent, and a great convincement there was. They were turned to Chri&s;t, and many of them received him, and &s;ate down under him, their vine. Here we par|ted with Amor Stoddart and others, who intended to meet us again in Huntingdon&s;hire.</P>
<P>About the &s;econd hour in the morning we took hor&s;e for Norwich, where Chri&s;topher Atkins, that dirty man, had run out, and brought di&s;honour upon the ble&s;&s;ed truth and the name of the Lord. But he had been denied by friends, and afterwrads he gave forth a paper of condemnation of his &s;in and evil. We came to Yarmouth, and &s;taid awhile; where there was a friend, Thoms Bond, in pri&s;on, for the truth of Chir&s;t. There we had &s;ome &s;ervice; &s;ome being turned to the Lord in that town. From thence we rode to another town about twenty miles off, where were many tender people. I was moved of the Lord to &s;peak to the people as I &s;at upon my hor&s;e, in &s;everal places as I pa&s;&s;ed along. We went to another twon about five miles from thence, and &s;et upon my hor&s;e, in &s;everal places as I pa&s;&s;ed along. We went to another town about five miles from thence, and &s;et upon my hor&s;es as an inn; Richard Hubber|thorn annd I having travelled five-and-forty miles that day. There were &s;ome friendly people in the town; and we had a tender, broken meeting among&s;t them, in the Lord's power, to his pai&s;e.</P>
<P>We bid the ho&s;tler have our hor&s;es ready by three in the morning; for we imended to tide to Lynn, about three-and-thirty miles, next morning. But when we were in bed, about elevent at night came the con&s;table and officers, with a great rabble of people into the inn, and &s;aid, They were come with an hue and cry from a ju&s;tice of peace, that lived near the town where I had &s;poken to the people in the &s;treets as I rode along, to &s;earch for two hor&s;emen that rode upon grey hor&s;es, and in grey cloaths; an hou&s;e having been broken upon the &s;eventh-day before at night. We told them, <Q>We were hone&s;t innocent men, and ab|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">horred &s;uch things;</Q> yet they apprehended us, and &s;et a guard with halberds and pikes upon us that night; making &s;ome of tho&s;e friendly people, with others, watch us. Next morning we were up betime, and the con&s;table with is guard carried us bofore a ju&s;tice of peace about five miles off. We took two or three of the &s;ufficient men of the twon with us, who had been at the meeting at captain
<PB N="190" REF="037441_0267_100D8F88D2B5DB20">Lawrence's, and could te&s;tify that we lay both the &s;eventh-day night and the fir&s;t-day night at captain Lawrence's; and it was the &s;eventh-day night that they &s;aid the hou&s;e was broken up. The reader is to be informed, that during the time I was pri&s;oner at the Mermaid at Charing-Cro&s;s, this captain Lawrence brought &s;everal Independent ju&s;tices to &s;ee me there, with whom I had a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e; which they took offence at. For they pleaded for imperfec|tion, and to &s;in as long as they lived; but did not like to hear of Chri&s;t's teaching his people him&s;elf, and making people as clear whil&s;t here upon the earth as Adam and Eve were before they fell. The&s;e ju&s;tices had plotted toge|ther this mi&s;chief again&s;t me in the country, pretending an hou&s;e was broken up; that they might &s;end their hue and cry after me. They were vexed al&s;o and troubled to hear of the great meeting at John Lawrence's; for a colonel was convinced there that day, who lived and died in the truth. But Providence &s;o ordered, that the con&s;table carried us to a ju&s;tice about five miles onward in our way towards Lynn, who was not an Independent ju&s;tice, as the re&s;t were. When we were brought before him, he began to be angry, becau&s;e we did not put off our hats to him. I told him, I had been before the protector, and he was not offended at my hat; and why &s;hould he be offended, who was but one of his &s;ervants? Then he read the hue and cry; and I told him, <Q>That night, wherein the hou&s;e was &s;aid to be broken up, we were at captain Lawrence's hou&s;e; and that we had &s;everal men pre&s;ent could te&s;tify the truth thereof.</Q> Thereupon the ju&s;tice, having examined us and them, &s;aid, <Q>He believed we were not the men that had broken the hou&s;e; but he was &s;orry,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>that he had no more again&s;t us.</Q> We told him, <Q>He ought not to be &s;orry for not having evil again&s;t us, but rather to be glad; for to rejoice when he got evil again&s;t people, as for hou&s;e-breaking or the like, was not a good mind in him.</Q> It was a good while yet before he could re&s;olve, whether to let us go, or &s;end us to pri&s;on; and the wicked con&s;table <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">irred him up again&s;t us, telling him, <Q>We had good hor&s;es; and that if it plea&s;ed him, he would carry us to Norwich gaol.</Q> But we took hold of the ju&s;tice's confe&s;&s;ion, <Q>That he believed we were not the men that had broken the hou&s;e;</Q> and after we had admoni&s;hed him to fear the Lord in his day, the Lord's power came over him, that he let us go; &s;o their &s;nare was broken. A great peo|ple
<PB N="191" REF="037441_0268_100D8F8AEF5C7B30">were afterwards gathered to the Lord in that town, where I was moved to &s;peak to them in the &s;treet, from whence the hue and cry came.</P>
<P>Being &s;et at liberty, we travelled to Lynn; to which we came about the third hour in the afternoon. Having &s;et up our hor&s;es, we met with Jo&s;eph Fuce, who was an en|&s;ign. We de&s;ired him to &s;peak to as many of the people of the town as he could, that feared God; and the captains and officers to come together: which he did. We had a very glorious meeting among&s;t them, and turned them to the Spirit of God, by which they might know God and Chri&s;t, and under&s;tand the &s;criptures; and learn of God and of Chri&s;t, as the prophets and apo&s;tles did. Many were convinced there; and a fine meeting there is, of them that are come off from the hirelings teaching, and &s;it under the teaching of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Lynn being then a garri&s;on, we de&s;ired Jo&s;eph Fuce to get us the gate opened by the third hour next morning; for we had forty miles to ride next day. By that means getting out early, we came next day by the eleventh or twelfth hour to Sutton, near the i&s;le of Ely, where Amor Stoddart, and the friends with him, met us again. A mul|titude of people was gathered thither, and no le&s;s than four prie&s;ts. The prie&s;t of the town made a great jangle; but the Lord's power &s;o confounded him, that he went away. The other three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">id; and one of them was convinced. One of the other two, whil&s;t I was &s;peaking, came to lean upon me: but I bid him &s;it down, &s;eeing he was &s;o &s;loth|ful. A great convincement there was that day. Many hundreds were turned from darkne&s;s to light, from the power of Satan unto God, and from the &s;pirit of error to the Spirit of truth, to be led thereby into all truth. People came to this meeting from Huntingdon, and beyond; the mayor's wife of Cambridge was there al&s;o. A glorious meeting it was; many were &s;ettled under Chri&s;t's teaching, and knew him their Shepherd to feed them: for the word of life was freely declared, and gladly received by them. The meeting ended in the power of the Lord, and in peace; and after it was done, I walked into a garden: where I had not been long, before a friend came and told me, &s;eve|ral ju&s;tices were come to break up the meeting. But ma|ny of the people were gone away; &s;o they mi&s;&s;ed of their de&s;ign; and after they had &s;taid awhile, they departed al&s;o in a fret.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="037441_0269_100D8F8D48EB4788">
That evening I pa&s;&s;ed to Cambridge. When I came in|to the town, the &s;cholars, hearing of me, were up, and were exceeding rude. I kept on my hor&s;e's back, and rode thro' them in the Lord's power; but they unhor&s;ed Amor Stoddart before he could get to the inn. When we were in the inn, they were &s;o rude in the courts and in the &s;treets, that the miners, colliers, and carters could never be ruder. The people of the hou&s;e a&s;ked us, What we would have for &s;upper? 'Supper!' &s;aid I, <Q>were it not that the Lord's power is over them, the&s;e rude &s;cholars look as if they would pluck us in pieces, and make a &s;upper of us.</Q> They knew I was &s;o again&s;t the trade of preaching, which they were there as apprentices to learn, that they raged as bad as ever Diana's craft&s;men did again&s;t Paul. At this place John Crook met us. When it was within night, the may|or of the town, being friendly, came and fetched me to his hou&s;e; and as we walked through the &s;treets, there was a bu&s;tle in the town; but they did not know me, it being darki&s;h. They were in a rage not only again&s;t me, but again&s;t the mayor al&s;o; &s;o that he was almo&s;t afraid to walk the &s;treets with me, for the tumult. We &s;ent for the friendly people, and had a fine meeting in the power of God; and I &s;taid there all night. Next morning, having ordered our hor&s;es to be ready by the &s;ixth hour, we pa&s;&s;ed peaceably out of town; and the de&s;troyers were di&s;appointed: for they thought I would have &s;taid long<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in the town, and intended to have done us mi&s;chief; but our pa&s;&s;ing away early in the morning fru&s;trated their evil purpo&s;es again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Then we rode to Bi&s;hop-Stortford, where &s;ome were convinced; and to Hertford, where al&s;o &s;ome were convin|ced; and where now there is a large meeting.</P>
<P>From thence we returned to London, where friends re|ceived us gladly; the Lord's power having carried us through many &s;nares and dangers. Great &s;ervice we had, for many hundreds were brought to &s;it under the teaching of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t their Saviour, and to prai&s;e the Lord through him. James Nayler al&s;o was come up to London; and Richard Hubberthorn and I &s;taid &s;ome time in the city, vi&s;iting friends, and an&s;wering gain&s;ayers: for we had great di&s;putes with profe&s;&s;ors of all &s;orts. Many reproaches they ca&s;t upon truth, and lying &s;landerous books they gave forth again&s;t us; but we an&s;wered them, cleared God's truth, &s;et it over them, and the Lord's power was over all.</P>

Among&s;t other &s;ervices for the Lord, which then lay up|on me in the city, I was moved to give forth a paper to tho&s;e that made a &s;corn at trembling and quaking:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE word of the Lord to you all, that &s;corn trem|bling and quaking, who &s;corn, throw &s;tones at, and belch forth oaths again&s;t tho&s;e who are trembling and quaking, threatening and beating them. Strangers ye are to all the apo&s;tles and prophets; and are of the generation that &s;toned them and mocked them in tho&s;e ages. Ye are of the &s;coffers which they &s;pake of, that are come in the la&s;t times. Be ye witne&s;&s;es again&s;t your&s;elves. To the light in all your con&s;ciences I &s;peak, that with it you may &s;ee your&s;elves to be out of the life of the holy men of God.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es, who was judge over all I&s;rael, trembled, feared, and quaked, when the Lord &s;aid unto him, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of I&s;aac, and the God of Jacob; then he trembled, and dur&s;t not behold. This, which makes to tremble now, ye teachers and people &s;coff at, and &s;corn tho&s;e in your &s;treets who witne&s;s the power of the Lord. Mo&s;es for&s;ook the plea&s;ures of the world, which he might have enjoyed for a &s;ea&s;on. He might have been called the &s;on of Pharaoh's daughter; he re|fu&s;ed it, and for&s;ook Pharaoh's hou&s;e; yet was no vaga|bond. David, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing, trembled. He was mocked; they made &s;ongs on him; they wagged their heads at him. Will you profe&s;s David's words, and Mo&s;es's words, who are in the generation of your fathers, mockers, &s;coffers, wonderers and de&s;pi&s;ers, which are to peri&s;h? O blu&s;h! Be a&s;hamed of all your profe&s;&s;ion, and be confounded! Job trembled, his fle&s;h trembled, and they mocked him; &s;o do you now mock them in whom the &s;ame power of God is made manife&s;t; yet you profe&s;s Job's words. O deceitful hypocrites! will ye not own &s;cripture? O for &s;hame! Never profe&s;s &s;cripture words, and deny the power, which, according to the &s;cripture, makes the keepers of the hou&s;e to tremble, and the &s;trong man to bow him|&s;elf. The&s;e things prie&s;ts, magi&s;trates, and people &s;coff at; but with the power ye are judged, and by the power and life condemned.</P>
<P>The prophet Jeremiah trembled, he &s;hook, his bones quaked, he reeled to and fro, like a drunken man, when he &s;aw the deceit of the prie&s;ts and prophets who were
<PB N="194" REF="037441_0271_100D8F9151B59D78">turned from the way of God; and they were not a&s;hamed, neither could they blu&s;h. Such were gone from the light; and &s;uch were they that ruled over the people. But he was brought to cry, O fooli&s;h people! that had eyes, and could not &s;ee; that had ears, and could not hear; that did not fear the Lord, and tremble at his pre&s;ence, who placed the &s;ands for bounds to the &s;ea by a perpetual decree, that the waves thereof cannot pa&s;s! And be &s;aid. <Q>A horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets prophe&s;y fal&s;ely, and the prie&s;ts bear rule by their means. Shall not I vi&s;it for the&s;e things, &s;aith the Lord? Shall not my &s;oul be avenged upon &s;uch a nation as this?</Q> They were &s;uch as did not tremble at the word of the Lord; there|fore he called them a fooli&s;h people. Hear all ye the word of the Lord, ye fooli&s;h people, who &s;corn trembling and quaking. Give over profe&s;&s;ing the prophet Jeremiah's words, and making a trade of them; for with his words you are judged to be among the &s;coffers, &s;corners, and &s;tockers. For he was &s;tocked by your generation; and you now &s;tock them that tremble at the word of the Lord, at the power of the mighty God, which rai&s;es up the Seed of God, and throws down the earth which hath kept it down. So you that are in the fall, where death reigneth, enemies of the truth, de&s;pi&s;ing the pow|er of God, as tho&s;e of your generation ever did wo and mi&s;ery is your portion, except y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;peedily repent. I&s;aiah &s;aid, <Q>Hear the word of the Lord, all ye that tremble at his word.</Q> And he &s;aid, <Q>This was the man that God did regard, who was of a broken and contrite heart, and trembled at his word. When their brethren hated and per&s;ecuted them, &s;aying, Let the Lord be glo|rified; he &s;hall appear to your joy, but they &s;hall be a&s;hamed,</Q> I&s;a. lxvi. 5. Now all ye &s;coffers and &s;corners, that de&s;pi&s;e trembling, you regard not the word of the Lord; they are not regarded by you, that tremble at the word; who are regarded by the Lord: therefore you are contrary to I&s;aiah's words. Profe&s;s him and his words no more for &s;hame, nor make a trade of his words. Ye that &s;eek for your gain from your quarter, ye greedy, dumb dogs, that never have enough, ye are they that de|&s;pi&s;e trembling; ye are &s;uch as I&s;aiah cried again&s;t, who him&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed trembling.

It is manife&s;t you walk in the &s;teps of your forefathers, that per&s;ecuted the prophets. Habakkuk, the prophet of the Lord, trembled. Joel, the prophet of the Lord, &s;aid, <Q>Blow the trumpet in Zion, and let all the inhabitants of the earth tremble.</Q> The people &s;hall tremble, and all faces &s;hall gather blackne&s;s; and the people &s;hall be much pained. And now this trembling is witne&s;&s;ed by the power of the Lord. This power of the Lord is come; the trumpet is &s;ounding, the earth is &s;haking; the inhabitants of the earth are trem|bling; the dead is ari&s;ing; and the living is prai&s;ing God: the world is raging; the &s;coffers are &s;corning; and they that witne&s;s trembling and quaking wrought in them by the power of the Lord, can &s;carce pa&s;s up and down the &s;treets but with &s;tones and blows, fi&s;ts and &s;ticks, or dogs &s;et at them, or they are pur&s;ued with mockings and re|proaches. Thus you vent your malice again&s;t them that witne&s;s the power of the Lord, as the prophets did; who are come to the broken heart and contrite &s;pirit; who tremble at the word of the Lord, and whom the Lord regards: the&s;e you &s;tone, &s;tock, &s;et your dogs at; the&s;e you &s;coff and &s;corn; the&s;e you revile and reproach; but the&s;e reproaches are our riches; prai&s;ed be the Lord who hath given us p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er over them. If you &s;ee one, as Ha|bakkuk, who&s;e lips quivered, who&s;e belly &s;hook; who &s;aid, "Rottenne&s;s was entered into his bones," and who trembled in him&s;elf; if you &s;ee &s;uch an one in this condi|tion now, ye &s;ay he is bewitched. Here again you &s;hew your&s;elves &s;trangers to that power, to that life which was in the prophet: therefore, for &s;hame, never make a pro|fe&s;&s;ion of his words, nor a trade of his words; nor of Joel's, who witne&s;&s;ed trembling, which ye &s;corn and &s;coff at. Ye proud &s;corners, mi&s;ery is your end, except you &s;peedily repent. Daniel, a &s;ervant of the mo&s;t high God, trembled; his &s;trength and his breath were gone. He was pri&s;oned, he was hated, he was per&s;ecuted. They laid baits and &s;nares for him, in whom the holy Spirit of God was. For &s;hame, you that make a profe&s;&s;ion of Da|niel's words, give over your profe&s;&s;ion, prie&s;ts and people, who &s;coff and &s;corn at trembling: with the light you are &s;een to be out of Daniel's life, and by the &s;ame power you are judged, at which you &s;corn and &s;coff <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> again

Paul, a mini&s;ter of God, made by the will of God a me&s;&s;enger of the Lord Je&s;us, a ve&s;&s;el of the Lord, to carry his name abroad into &s;everal nations, when the dark, blind world have got &s;ome of his words and epi&s;tles, you teachers make a trade of them, and get great &s;ums of mo|ney for it, &s;o you de&s;troy &s;ouls for di&s;hone&s;t gain; making a trade of his words, and of the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles, pro|phets, and of Chri&s;t's words, but denying the Spirit and life that they were guided by, and that power which &s;hook the fle&s;h and the earth; which the apo&s;tle witne&s;&s;ed, who &s;aid, <Q>When he came among the Corinthians, he was with them in weakne&s;s and fear, and in much trembling, that their faith might not &s;tand in the wi&s;dom of words, but in the power of God;</Q> in that power which made him to tremble.

<P>This year came out the oath of abjuration, by which many friends &s;uffered. Several friends went to &s;peak with the Protector about it; but he began to harden. And &s;uf|ferings increa&s;ing upon friends, by rea&s;on that envious ma|gi&s;trates made u&s;e of that oath as a &s;nare to catch them in, who the knew could not &s;wear at all; I was moved to write to the Protector as followeth:</P>

<P>THE magi&s;trate is not to bear the &s;word in vain, who ought to be a terror to the evil-doers; but the ma|gi&s;trate that bears the &s;word in vain, as he is not a terror to evil-doers, &s;o he is not a prai&s;e to them that do well.

Who live in plea&s;ures are dead while they live, and who live in wantonne&s;s kill the ju&s;t. This we know by the Spirit of God which gave forth the &s;criptures, which God the Father hath given to us, and hath placed his righteous law in our hearts; which law is a terror to evil-doers, and an&s;wers that which is of God in every man's con&s;cience. They who act contrary to the mea&s;ure of God's Spirit in every man's con&s;cience, ca&s;t the law of God behind their backs, and walk de&s;pitefully again&s;t the Spirit of Grace. The magi&s;trate's &s;word, we &s;ee, is borne in vain, whil&s;t evil-doers are at liberty to do evil, and they that cry again&s;t &s;uch are, for &s;o doing, puni&s;hed by the magi&s;trate, who hath turned his &s;word backward again&s;t the Lord. Now the wicked one fenceth him&s;elf, and per&s;ecutes the innocent, as vagabonds and wanderers, for crying again&s;t &s;in, unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and ungodline&s;s openly, in the markets and in the highways; or as railers, becau&s;e they tell them what judgment will come upon tho&s;e that follow &s;uch practices. Here they that depart from iniquity are become a prey, and few lay it to heart. But God will thre&s;h the mountains, beat the hills, cleave the rocks, and ca&s;t into his pre&s;s which is trodden with|out the city, and will bathe his &s;word in the blood of the wicked and unrighteous. You that have drunk the cup of abominations, an hard cup have you to drink, you who are the enemies of God, of you he will be avenged. You in whom &s;omething of God is remaining, con&s;ider; If the &s;word was not borne in vain, but turned again&s;t evil-doers, the righteous would not &s;uffer, and be ca&s;t into holes, dungeons, corners, pri&s;ons, and hou&s;es of correction, as peace-breakers, for crying again&s;t &s;in openly, as they are commanded of the Lord, and for crying again&s;t the covetou&s;ne&s;s of the prie&s;ts and their fal&s;e wor&s;hips; who exact money of poor people, whom they do no work for.
<PB N="203" REF="037441_0280_100D7F61C239C360">Oh! where will you appear in the day of the Lord? How will you &s;tand in the day of his righteous judgment?

The royal law of Chri&s;t, "To do as ye would be done by," is trodden down under foot; &s;o that men can profe&s;s him in words, but crucify him where&s;oever he appears, and ca&s;t him into pri&s;on, as the talkers of him always did in generations and ages pa&s;t. The labourers, which God, the ma&s;ter of the harve&s;t, hath &s;ent into his vineyard, do the chief of the prie&s;ts and the rulers now take coun&s;el together again&s;t to ca&s;t them into pri&s;on: here are the fruits of prie&s;ts, people, and rulers, without the fear of God. The day is come and coming that every man's work doth and &s;hall appear; glo|ry be to the Lord God for ever! See and con&s;ider the days you have &s;pent, and the days you do &s;pend; for this is your day of vi&s;itation. Many have &s;uffered great fines, becau&s;e they could not &s;wear, but abide in Chri&s;t's doctrine, who &s;aith, Swear not at all: and by that means are they made a prey upon for abiding in the command of Chri&s;t. Many are ca&s;t into pri&s;on and made a prey up|on, becau&s;e they cannot take the oath of abjuration, tho' they denied all that is abjured in it; and by that means many of the me&s;&s;engers and mini&s;ters of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t are ca&s;t into pri&s;on, becau&s;e they will not &s;wear nor go out of Chri&s;t's command. Therefore, O man! con&s;i|der; to the mea&s;ure of the life of God in thee I &s;peak. Many al&s;o lie in gaols, becau&s;e they cannot pay the prie&s;ts tithes; many have their goods &s;poiled, and treble dama|ges taken of them; many are whipped and beaten in the hou&s;es of correction, who have broken no law. The&s;e things are done in thy name, in order to protect them in the&s;e actions. If men fearing God bore the &s;word, and covetou&s;ne&s;s was hated, and men of courage for God were &s;et up, then they would be a terror to evil-doers and a prai&s;e to them that do well; and not cau&s;e &s;uch to &s;uffer. Here equity would be heard in our land, and righteou&s;|ne&s;s would &s;tand up and take place; which giveth not place to the unrighteous, but judgeth it. To the mea&s;ure of God's Spirit in thee I &s;peak, that thou maye&s;t con&s;ider and come to rule for God: that thou maye&s;t an&s;wer that which is of God in every man's con&s;cience; for that is it which bringeth to honour all men in the Lord.

<P>After I had cleared my&s;elf of tho&s;e &s;ervices for the Lord. which lay upon me in the city of London, I pa&s;&s;ed into Bedford&s;hire and Northampton&s;hire. At Wellingborough, in Northampton&s;hire, I had a great meeting, in which the Lord's everla&s;ting power and truth was over all; and many in that country were turned to the Lord. Great rage was among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors; for the wicked prie&s;ts, Pre&s;byteri|ans, and Independents fal&s;ely reported, <Q>That we carried bottles about with us, which we gave people to drink of, which made them follow us:</Q> but the Power. Spirit, and Truth of God kept friends over the rage of the people. Great &s;poiling al&s;o there was of friends goods for tithes by the Independent, Pre&s;byterian, and &s;ome Bapti&s;t p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ts, who had got into the &s;leeple-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>From Wellingborough I went into Leice&s;ter&s;hire, where colonel Hacker had threatened, If I came he would impri|&s;on me again, though the Protector had &s;et me at liberty: but when I was come to Whet&s;tone, the meeting from which he took me before, all was quiet. Colonel Hacker's wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and his mar&s;hal came to the meeting, and were convinced; for the glorious, powerful day of the Lord was exalted over all, and many were convinced that day. There were at that meeting two ju&s;tices of the peace from Wales, their names
<PB N="206" REF="037441_0283_100D8FA4AE6E13F0">were Peter Price and Walter Jenkin; who came both to be mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I went from thence to Sileby, to William Smith's, where was a great meeting, to which &s;everal Bapti&s;ts came; one of them, a Bapti&s;t teacher, was convinced, and came to &s;it under the Lord's teaching by his Spirit and Power. This Bapti&s;t &s;aid. He had baptized thirty in a day.</P>
<P>From thence I went to Drayton, my native town, where &s;o many prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors had formerly gathered to|gether again&s;t me; but now never a prie&s;t nor profe&s;&s;or did appear. I a&s;ked &s;ome of my relations, Where all the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors were? They &s;aid the prie&s;t of Non-eaton was dead, and eight or nine of them were &s;ecking to get his benefice. 'They will let you alone now,' &s;aid they, <Q>for they are like a company of crows, when a rotten &s;heep is dead, they all gather together to pull out the puddings; &s;o do the prie&s;ts for a fallen benefice.</Q> The&s;e were &s;ome of their own hearers that &s;aid &s;o of them: but they had &s;pent their venom again&s;t me, and the Lord delivered me by his power out of their &s;nare.</P>
<P>Then I went to Badgley, where was a great meeting. Numbers came far to it. Many were convinced, and turn|ed to the Lord; who came under chri&s;t's teaching, and were &s;ettled upon him, their foundation and rock.</P>
<P>From thence I pa&s;&s;ed into Nottingham&s;hire, and had large meetings; and into derby&s;hire, where the Lord's power came over all. Many were turned from darkne&s;s to light, from the power of Satan unto God, and came to re|ceive the Holy Gho&s;t. Great miracles were wrought in many places by the power of the Lord through &s;everal.</P>
<P>In Derby&s;hire James Nayler met me, and told me, &s;e|ven or eight prie&s;ts had challenged him to a di&s;pute. I had a travail in my Spirit for him, and the Lord an&s;wered me. I was moved to bid him go on, <Q>and God Almighty would be with him, and give him the victory in his pow|er.</Q> And the Lord did &s;o; in&s;omuch that the people &s;aw the prie&s;ts were foiled, and cried, <Q>A Nailer, a Nailer hath confuted them all.</Q> After the di&s;pute he came to me again, prai&s;ing the Lord. Thus was the Lord's day proclaimed, and &s;et over all their heads. People began to &s;ee the apo&s;|tacy and &s;lavery they had been under to their hireling teachers, and came to know their teacher the Lord Je&s;us, who had purcha&s;ed them, and made their peace betwixt God and them. While we were here, friends came out of
<PB N="207" REF="037441_0284_100D8FA702C361D8">York&s;hire to &s;ee us, and were glad of the pro&s;perity of truth.</P>
<P>After this I pa&s;&s;ed into Warwick&s;hire among&s;t friends, vi&s;iting their meetings; and &s;o into Worce&s;ter&s;hire. I had a meeting at Birmingham, where &s;everal were convinced, and turned to the Lord. I came to one Cole's hou&s;e near Chattan. This Cole had given an Independent preacher a meeting-place, who came to be convinced; after which he laid a&s;ide his preaching; whereupon the old man&mdash; Cole gave him an hundred pounds a year. I had a meet|ing there; a very great one it was, in&s;omuch that the meeting-place would not hold the people. Many were turned to the Lord that day. Afterwards, when the time of trials came, this Independent did not &s;tand to that which had convinced him; but turned back: whereupon the old man took away his 100<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year from him again. But Cole him&s;elf died in God's truth.</P>
<P>I heard that at Eve&s;ham the magi&s;trates had ca&s;t &s;everal friends into divers pri&s;ons; and that, hearing of my coming, they made a pair of high &s;tocks. I &s;ent for Edward Pitta|way, a friend, who lived near Eve&s;ham, and a&s;ked him the truth of the thing. He &s;aid, it was &s;o. I went that night with him to Eve&s;ham; and in the evening we had a large, precious meeting, wherein friends and people were refre&s;h|ed with the word of life, the power of the Lord. Next morning I rode to one of the pri&s;ons, and vi&s;ited friends there, and encouraged them. Then I rode to the other pri&s;on, where were &s;everal pri&s;oners. Among&s;t them was Humphry Smith, who had been a prie&s;t, but was now be|come a free mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t. When I had vi&s;ited friends at both pri&s;ons, and was turned to go out of the town, I e&s;pied the magi&s;trates coming up the town to have &s;eized me in pri&s;on. But the Lord fru&s;trated their intent, the in|nocent e&s;caped their &s;nare, and God's ble&s;&s;ed power came over them all. But exceeding rude and envirous were the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors about this time in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>I went from Eve&s;ham to Worce&s;ter, and had a precious meeting there, and quiet. After which, coming towards our inn, &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors fell to di&s;cour&s;e with friends, and were like to have made a tumult in the city. As we went into the inn, they all cluttered into the yard; but I went among them and got them quieted. Next day I walked into the town, and had a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome of the profe&s;&s;ors concerning Chri&s;t and the way of truth.
<PB N="208" REF="037441_0285_100D8FA905412378">One of them denied, that Chri&s;t was of Abraham according to the fle&s;h, and that he was declared to be the Son of God according to the Spirit. I proved from Rom. i. that he was of the &s;eed of Abraham, being made of the &s;eed of Da|vid according to the fle&s;h; and that according to the Spirit he was declared to be the Son of God. Afterwards I wrote a paper concerning it.</P>
<P>From Worce&s;ter we went to Tewk&s;bury, where in the evening we had a great meeting, to which came the prie&s;t of the town with a great rabble of rude people. The prie&s;t boa&s;ted, that he would &s;ee whether he or I &s;hould have the victory. <Q>I turned the people to the Divine Light, which Chri&s;t, the heavenly and &s;piritual man, enlighteneth them withal; that with that Light they might &s;ee their &s;ins, and that they were in death and darkne&s;s, and with|out God in the world; and might al&s;o &s;ee Chri&s;t from whom it cometh, their Saviour and Redeemer, who &s;hed his blood and died for them; who is the way to God, the truth, and the life.</Q> Here the prie&s;t began to rage again&s;t the Light, and denied it; for neither prie&s;t nor profe&s;&s;or could endure to hear the Light &s;poken of. Having railed at the Light the prie&s;t went away, and left his rude com|pany among&s;t us; but the Lord's power came over them, though mi&s;chief was in their hearts.</P>
<P>Leaving Tewk&s;bury we pa&s;&s;ed to Warwick, where in the evening we had a meeting at a widow-woman's hou&s;e with many &s;ober people. A precious meeting we had in the Lord's power; &s;everal were convinced, and turned to the Lord. After the meeting, a Bapti&s;t in the company began to jangle; and the bailiff of the town, with his officers, came in and &s;aid. What do the&s;e people here at this time of night? So he &s;ecured John Crook, Amor Stoddart, Gerrard Roberts, and me; but we had leave to go to our inn, and to be forth-coming in the morning. The next morning many rude people came into the inn, and into our chambers, de&s;perate fellows; but the Lord's power gave us dominion over them. Gerrard Roberts and John Crook went to the batliff to know what he had to &s;ay to us. He &s;aid, we might go our ways, for he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to &s;ay to us.

One of them took hold of my hor&s;e's bridle, and broke it; but the hor&s;e drawing back threw him under him. Though the bailiff &s;aw this, yet he did not &s;top, not &s;o much as rebuke the rude multitude; &s;o that it was much we had not been &s;lain or hurt in the &s;treets; for the people threw &s;tones and &s;truck at us as we rode along the town.</P>
<P>When we were quite out of the town, I told friends, <Q>It was upon me from the Lord that I mu&s;t go back into the town again; and if any one of them felt any thing upon him from the Lord, he might follow me; the re&s;t that did not, might go on to Dun-cow.</Q> So I pa&s;&s;ed through the market in the dreadful power of God, declar|ing the word of life to them; and John Crook followed me. Some &s;truck at me; but the Lord's power was over them, and gave me dominion over all. I &s;hewed them their unworthine&s;s of the name of chri&s;tians, and the un|worthine&s;s of their teachers, that had not brought them into more &s;obriety; and what a &s;hame they were to chri&s;tianity!</P>
<P>Having cleared my&s;elf I turned out of the town again, and pa&s;&s;ed to Coventry; where we found the people clo&s;ed up with darkne&s;s. I went to a profe&s;&s;or's hou&s;e I had for|merly been at, and he was drunk; which grieved my &s;oul &s;o, that I did not go into any hou&s;e in the town; but rode into &s;ome of the &s;treets, and into the market-place. I felt the power of the Lord was over the town.</P>
<P>Then I went to Dun-cow, and had a meeting in the evening, and &s;ome were turned to the Lord by his Spirit, as &s;ome al&s;o were at Warwick and Tewk&s;bury. We lay at Dun-cow that night; where we met with John Camm, a faithful mini&s;ter of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel. In the morning there gathered a rude company of prie&s;ts and people, who behaved more like bea&s;ts than men; for &s;ome of them came riding on hor&s;eback into the room where we were; but the Lord gave us dominion over them.</P>
<P>From thence we pa&s;&s;ed into Leice&s;ter&s;hire, where we had a great meeting at the place where I had been taken for|merly. After that we came to Badgley, in Warwick&s;hire. Here William Edmund&s;on who lived in Ireland, having &s;ome drawings upon his &s;pirit to come into England to &s;ee me, met with me; by whom I wrote a &s;ew lines to friends then convinced in the north of Ireland.</P>

<P>When the&s;e few lines were read amo g&s;t the friends in Ireland at their meeting, the power of the Lord &s;eized up|on all in the room.</P>
<P>From Badgley we pa&s;&s;ed to Swanington and Higham, and into Northampton&s;hire and Bedford&s;hire, having great meet|ings. Many were turned to the Lord by his Power and Spirit. When we came to Baldock in Hertford&s;hire, I a&s;k|ed, 'If there was nothing in that town, no profe&s;&s;ion?' It was an&s;wered me, There were &s;ome Bapti&s;ts, and a Bapti&s;t woman &s;ick. John Ru&s;h of Bedford&s;hire went with me to vi&s;it her. When we came in, many tender people were about her. They told me, <Q>She was not a woman for this world; but if I had any thing to comfort her concerning the world to come. I might &s;peak to her.</Q> I was moved of the Lord to &s;peak to her; and he rai&s;ed her up again, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the town and country. Her hu&s;band's name was Baldock. This Bapti&s;t woman and her hu&s;band came to be convinced; and many hundreds of people have met at their hou&s;e &s;ince. Great meetings and convince|ments were in tho&s;e parts afterwards; many received the word of life, and fat down under the teaching of Chri&s;t their Saviour.</P>
<P>When we had vi&s;ited this &s;ick woman, we returned to our inn; where we found two de&s;perate fellows fighting &s;o furiou&s;ly, that none dur&s;t come nigh to part them. But I was moved in the Lord's power to go to them: and when I had loo&s;ed their hands, I held one of them by one hand, and the other by the other, &s;heved them the evil of their doings, and reconciled them one to the other; and they were &s;o loving and thankful to me, that people admired at it.</P>
<P>From thence I pa&s;&s;ed to Market-&s;treet, where God had a people; and through Albans to London, where friends were glad of the pro&s;perity of truth, and the manife&s;tation of the Lord's glorious power, which had delivered us, and
<PB N="211" REF="037441_0288_100D8FAEA1337F18">carried us through many dangers and difficulties. I al&s;o rejoiced to find truth pro&s;per in the city, and all things well among&s;t friends there. Only there was one John Toldervey, who had been convinced of truth, and run out from it; and the envirous prie&s;ts took occa&s;ion from thence to write a wicked book again&s;t friends which they &s;tuffed with many lies, to render truth and friends odious. They intituled their book, "The Foot out of the Snare." But this poor man came to &s;ee his folly, and returned, condem|ned his back&s;liding, an&s;wered the prie&s;ts book, and mani|fe&s;ted all their lies and wickedne&s;s. Thus the Lord's pow|er came over them; his everla&s;ting Seed reigned, and reigns to this day.</P>
<P>After I had tarried &s;ome time in London, and had vi&s;i|ted friends in their meetings, I went out of town, leaving James Nayler in the city. As I pa&s;&s;ed from him, I ca&s;t my eyes upon him, and a fear &s;truck me concerning him; but I went away, and rode to Ryegate in Surry where I had a little meeting. There friends told me of one Tho|mas Moore, a ju&s;tice of peace, that lived not far from Rye|gate, a friendly, moderate man; whereupon I went to vi&s;it him at his hou&s;e, and he came to be a &s;erviceable man in truth.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed to Thomas Patchings, of Bin&s;combe in Go|dalming, where we had a meeting, to which &s;everal friends came from London. John Bolton and his wife came on &s;oot in fro&s;t and &s;now. After we had parted with friends there, we went towards Hor&s;ham Park; where having vi&s;it|ed friends, we went to Arundel and Chiche&s;ter, where we had meetings. At Chiche&s;ter many profe&s;&s;ors came in, and made &s;ome jangling: but the Lord's power was over them. The woman of the hou&s;e, where the meeting was, though convinced of truth, yet not keeping her mind clo&s;e to that which convinced her, &s;he fell in love with a man of the world, who was there that time. When I knew it, I took her a&s;ide, and was moved to &s;peak to her and to pray for her; but a light thing got up in her mind, and &s;he &s;lighted it. Af|terwards &s;he married that man; and &s;oon after went di&s;|tracted; Then was I &s;ent for to her; and the Lord was entreated, rai&s;ed her up again, and &s;ettled her mind by his power. Afterwards her hu&s;band died; and &s;he acknowledged the ju&s;t judgments of God were come upon her, for &s;light|ing the exhortation and coun&s;el I had given he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="037441_0289_100D8FB0B1676A48">
After we left Chiche&s;ter, we travelled to Port&s;mouth. There the &s;oldiers had us to the governor's hou&s;e. After &s;ome examination, the Lord's power came over them, and we were &s;et at liberty, and had a meeting in the town. Af|ter which we came to Ringwood, where in the evening we had a meeting. Several were convinced, and turned to the Spirit of the Lord, and to the teaching of Chri&s;t Je&s;us their Saviour.</P>
<P>From Ringwood we came to Pool; and, having &s;et up our hor&s;es at an inn, we &s;ent into the town to inquire for &s;uch as feared the Lord, and &s;uch as were worthy; and we had a meeting there with &s;everal &s;ober people. William Baily, a Bapti&s;t teacher, was convinced at that time. The people received truth in the inward parts, and were turn|ed to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their rock and foundation, their teacher and Saviour; and there is become a great ga|thering in the name of Je&s;us of a very tender people, who continue under Chri&s;t's teaching.</P>
<P>We went al&s;o to Southampton, and had a meeting, where &s;everal were convinced. Edward Pyot of Bri&s;tol travelled with me all this we&s;tern journey.</P>
<P>From thence we went to Dorche&s;ter, and alighted at an inn, a Bapti&s;t's hou&s;e: we &s;ent into the town to the Bap|ti&s;ts, to let us have their meeting-hou&s;e to a&s;&s;emble in, and to invite the &s;ober people to the meeting; but they denied it us. We &s;ent to them again, to know why they would deny us their meeting-hou&s;e? &s;o the thing was noi&s;ed in the town. Then we &s;ent them word, If they would not let us come to their hou&s;e, they, or any people that feared God, might come to our inn, if they plea&s;ed; but they were in a great rage. Their teacher, and many of them came up, and flapped their bibles on the table. I a&s;ked them, <Q>Why they were &s;o angry? were they angry with the bible?</Q> But they fell into a di&s;cour&s;e about their water|bapti&s;m. I a&s;ked them, <Q>Whether they could &s;ay they were &s;ent of God to baptize people, as John was? And whether they had the &s;ame Spirit and power that the apo&s;|tles had?</Q> They &s;aid, They had not. Then I a&s;ked them, <Q>How many powers there are? Whether there are any more than the power of God, and the power of the devil?</Q> They &s;aid. There was not any other power than tho&s;e two. Then &s;aid I, <Q>If you have not the power of God that the apo&s;tles had, you act by the power of the devil.</Q> Many &s;ober people were pre&s;ent, who &s;aid, <Q>They
<PB N="213" REF="037441_0290_100D8FB351E6C768">have thrown them&s;elves on their backs.</Q> Many &s;ub&s;tan|tial people were convinced that night; a precious &s;ervice we had there for the Lord, and his power came over all. Next morning, as we were pa&s;&s;ing away, the Bapti&s;ts, be|ing in a rage, began to &s;hake the du&s;t off their feet after us. 'What,' &s;aid I, <Q>in the power of darkne&s;s! We, who are in the power of God, &s;hake off the du&s;t of our feet again&s;t you.</Q></P>
<P>Leaving Dorche&s;ter, we came to Weymouth; where al&s;o we inquired after &s;ober people; and about four&s;core of them gathered together at a prie&s;t's hou&s;e, all very &s;ober people. Mo&s;t of them received the word of life, and were turned to their teacher Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who had enlightened them with his divine light, by which they might &s;ee their &s;ins, and him who &s;aveth from &s;in. A ble&s;&s;ed meeting we had with them, and they received the truth in the love of it, with gladne&s;s of heart. The meeting held &s;everal hours. <Q>The &s;tate of their teachers, and the apo&s;tacy was opened to them; and the &s;tate of the apo&s;tles, and of the church in their days: and the &s;tate of the law and of the prophets before Chri&s;t, and how Chri&s;t came to ful&s;il them; that he was their teacher in the apo&s;tles days; and that he was come now to teach his people him&s;elf by his power and &s;pirit.</Q> All was quiet, the meeting broke up peaceably, the people were very loving; and a meeting is continued in that town to this day. Many are added to them; and &s;ome who had been Ranters came to own the truth, and to live very &s;oberly.</P>
<P>There was a captain of hor&s;e in the town, who &s;ent to me, and would fain have had me to have &s;taid longer; but I was not to &s;tay. He and his man rode out of town with me about &s;even miles; Edward Pyot al&s;o being with me. This captain was the fatte&s;t, merrie&s;t, cheerfulle&s;t man, and the mo&s;t given to laughter, that ever I met with: in&s;omuch that I was &s;everal times moved to &s;peak in the dreadful power of the Lord to him; yet it was become &s;o cu&s;tomary to him, he would pre&s;ently laugh at any thing he &s;aw. But I &s;till admoni&s;hed him to come to &s;obriety, and the fear of the Lord, and &s;incerity. We lay at an inn that night; and the next morning I was moved to &s;peak to him again, when he parred from us. Next time I &s;aw him, he told me, When I &s;poke to him at parting, the power of the Lord &s;o &s;truck him, that before he got home he was &s;erious enough, and had left his laughing. He afterwards was convinced, and became a &s;erious good man, and died in the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="037441_0291_100D8FB61D266700">
Parting from him, we went to Honiton; and at our inn inquired, What people were in the town that feared God, and &s;ent for them. There came to us &s;ome of the particular Bapti&s;ts, with whom we had a great deal of rea|&s;oning. I told them, <Q>They held their doctrine of par|ticular election in E&s;au's, Cain's, and I&s;hmael's nature; not in Jacob, the &s;econd birth: but they mu&s;t be born again before they could enter the kingdom of God. And that as the promi&s;e of God was to the Seed, not as many, but as one, which was Chri&s;t; &s;o the election and choice &s;tainds in Chri&s;t; and they mu&s;t be &s;uch as walk in his light, grace, Spirit, and truth.</Q></P>
<P>From thence we pa&s;&s;ed to Top&s;ham, and &s;taid over fir&s;t, day; but the inn-keeper and his people were rude. Next morning we gave forth &s;ome queries to the prie&s;ts and pro|fe&s;&s;ors: whereupon &s;ome rude profe&s;&s;ors came to our inn; and, had we not gone when we did, they had &s;topped us. I wore a girdle, which through forgetfulne&s;s I left behind me, and afterwards &s;ent to the inn-keeper for; but he would not let me have it again. Afterwards, when he was troubled in his mind about it, he burnt it, le&s;t he &s;hould be bewitched by it, as he &s;aid; yet when he had burnt it, he was more trou|bled than before. Some, notwith&s;tanding the rudene&s;s of the place, were convinced, and a meeting was afterwards &s;ettled in that town, which hath continued ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>After this we pa&s;&s;ed to To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nes, a dark town. We lodged there at an inn; and that night Edward Pyot was &s;ick, but the Lord's power healed him, &s;o that the next day we got to King's Bridge, and at our inn inquired for the &s;ober people of the town. They directed us to Nicholas Tripe and his wi&s;e; and we went to their hou&s;e. They &s;ent for the prie&s;t, with whom we had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e; but he be|ing confounded, quickly left us. Nicholas Tupe and his wi&s;e were convinced; and &s;ince there is a good meeting of friends in that country. In the evening we returned to our inn. There being many people drinking in the hou&s;e, <Q>I was moved of the Lord to go among&s;t them, and direct them to the light which Chri&s;t the heavenly man had en|lightened them withal; by which they might &s;ee all their evil ways, words, and deeds, and by the &s;ame light they might al&s;o &s;ee Chri&s;t Je&s;us their Saviour.</Q> The inn-keeper &s;tood unea&s;y, &s;eeing it hindered his gue&s;ts from drinking; and as &s;oon as the la&s;t words were out of my mouth, he &s;natched up the candle, and &s;aid, <Q>Come, here is a light
<PB N="215" REF="037441_0292_100D8FB86CE7E920">for you to go into your chamber.</Q> Next morning, when he was cool, I repre&s;ented to him, <Q>What an uncivil thing it was for him &s;o to do;</Q> then warning him of the day of the Lord, we got ready and pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>We came next day to Plymouth, refre&s;hed our&s;elves at our inn, and went to Robert Cary's, where we had a very precious meeting. At this meeting was Elizabeth Trelaw|ny, daughter to a baronet. She being &s;omewhat thick of hearing, came clo&s;e up to me, and clapped her ear very nigh me, while I &s;pake; and &s;he was convinced. After this meeting came in &s;ome jangling Bapti&s;ts; but the Lord's power came over them, and Elizabeth Trelawny gave te&s;ti|mony thereto. A &s;ine meeting was &s;ettled there in the Lord's power, which hath continued ever &s;ince; where ma|ny faithful friends have been convinced.</P>
<P>From thence we pa&s;&s;ed into Cornwall, and came to an inn in the pari&s;h of Menhenniot. At night we had a meet|ing at Edward Hancock's, to which came Thomas Mounce and a prie&s;t, with a great deal of people. We brought the prie&s;t to confe&s;s, That he was a mini&s;ter made by the &s;tate, and maintained by the &s;tate; and he was confounded and went his way: but many of the people &s;taid. I directed them to the <Q>light of Chri&s;t, by which they might &s;ee their &s;ins, and their Saviour Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the way to God, their Me|diator to make peace betwixt God and them; their Shep|herd to feed them, and their Prophet to teach them. I di|rected them to the Spirit of God in them&s;elves, by which they might know the &s;criptures, and be led into all truth; and by the Spirit might know God, and in it have unity one with another.</Q> Many were convinced at that time, and came under Chri&s;t's teaching; and there are fine gatherings in the name of Je&s;us in tho&s;e parts at this day.</P>
<P>We travelled from thence through Penryn, and came to Hel&s;ton; but could not get to the knowledge of any &s;ober people, through the badne&s;s of the inn-keepers. At length we came to a village, where &s;ome Bapti&s;ts and &s;ober people lived, with whom we had di&s;cour&s;e. Some of them were brought to confe&s;s, that they &s;tumbled at the light of Chri&s;t. They would have had us to have &s;taid with them; but we pa&s;&s;ed thence to Market-Jew; and having taken up our lodging at an inn, we &s;ent over night to inquire for &s;uch as feared the Lord. Next morning the mayor and aldermen gathered together, with the high-&s;heriff of the county; and lent the con&s;tables to bid us come before them. We a&s;ked
<PB N="216" REF="037441_0293_100D8FBA8ED12EB0">them for their warrant; and they &s;aying they had none, we told them, we &s;hould not go along with them without a warrant. Upon the return of the con&s;tables without us, they &s;ent their &s;ergeants, and we a&s;ked them for their war|rant. They &s;aid, they had none; but told us, the mayor and aldermen &s;taid for us. We told them, the mayor and his company did not well to trouble us in our inn; and we &s;hould not go with them without a warrant. So they went away, and came again; and when we a&s;ked them for their warrant, one of them plucked his mace from under his cloak. We a&s;ked them. Whether it was their cu&s;tom to mole&s;t and trouble &s;trangers in their inns and lodgings? After &s;ome time Edward Pyot went to the mayor and alder|men, and a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e he had with them; but the Lord's power gave him dominion over them all. When he returned, &s;everal of the officers came to us; and we laid before them the incivility and unworthine&s;s of their carriage towards us, the &s;ervants of the Lord God, thus to &s;top and trouble us in our inns and lodgings; and what an unchri&s;|tian act it was. Before we left the town. I wrote a little paper, to be &s;ent to the &s;even pari&s;hes at the Land's End.</P>

When we came to Ives, Edward Pyot's hor&s;e having ca&s;t a &s;hoe, we &s;taid to have a &s;hoe &s;et; and while he was getting his hor&s;e &s;hod, I walked to the &s;ea-&s;ide. When I came back, I found the town in an uproar. They were haling Edward Pyot and the other friend before major Ceely. I followed them into the ju&s;tice's hou&s;e, though they did not lay hands upon me. When we came in, the hou&s;e was full of rude people; whereupon I a&s;ked, Whether there were not an officer among them, to keep the people civil? Major Ceely &s;aid, he was a magi&s;trate. I told him, <Q>He &s;hould &s;hew forth gravity and &s;obriety then, and u&s;e his authority to keep the people civil; for I never &s;aw any people ruder: the Indians were more like Chri&s;tians than they.</Q> After awhile they brought the paper, and a&s;ked, Whether I would own it? I &s;aid, Yes. Then he tendered the oath of abju|ration to us: whereupon I put my hand in my pocket, and produced the an&s;wer to it, which had been given to the protector. After I had given him that, he examined us &s;everally, one by one. He had with him a &s;illy, young prie&s;t, who a&s;ked us many frivolous que&s;tions; among&s;t the re&s;t, he de&s;ired to cut my hair, which then was pretty long; but I was not to cut it, though many were offended at it,
<PB N="218" REF="037441_0295_100D8FBE4E0278B8">I told them, <Q>I had no pride in it; and it was not of my own putting on.</Q> At length the ju&s;tice put us under a guard of &s;oldiers, who were hard and wild, like the ju&s;tice him&s;elf: neverthele&s;s we <Q>warned the people of the day of the Lord, and declared the truth to them.</Q> The next day he &s;ent us guarded by a party of hor&s;e, with &s;words and pi&s;tols, who took us to Redruth. On fir&s;t-day the &s;oldiers would have carried us away; but we told them, It was their &s;abbath, and it was not u&s;ual to travel on that day. Several of the town's people gathered about us; and whil&s;t I held the &s;oldiers in di&s;cour&s;e, Edward Pyot &s;poke to the people; and afterwards Edward Pyot held the &s;oldiers in di&s;cour&s;e whil&s;t I &s;poke to the people. In the mean time the other friend got out backwards, and went to the &s;teeple|hou&s;e, to &s;peak to the prie&s;t and people. The people were exceeding de&s;perate, in a mighty rage again&s;t him, and abu&s;ed him. The &s;oldiers al&s;o mi&s;&s;ing him, were in a great rage, and &s;eerred ready to kill us; but I declared the day of the Lord, and the word of eternal life to the people. In the afternoon the &s;oldiers were re&s;olved to have us away; &s;o we took hor&s;e. When we had rid to the town's end, I was moved of the Lord to go back again, to &s;peak to the old man of the hou&s;e. The &s;oldiers drew out their pi&s;tols, and &s;wore I &s;hould not go back. I heeded them not; but rode back, and they rode after me. So I cleared my&s;elf to the old man and the people; and then returned with them, and reproved them for being &s;o rude and violent.</P>
<P>At night we were brought to a town then called Smeth|ick, but &s;ince Falmouth. It being the evening of the fir&s;t-day, there came into our inn the chief con&s;table of the place, and many &s;ober people; &s;ome of whom began to inquire concerning us. We told them, We were pri&s;oners for truth's &s;ake; and a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e we had with them concerning the things of God. They were very &s;ober, and very loving to us. Some of them were convinced, and &s;tood faithful ever after.</P>
<P>When the con&s;table and the&s;e people were gone, others came in, who al&s;o were very civil, and went away very loving. When all were gone, we went to our chamber to go to bed; and about the eleventh hour Edward Pyot &s;aid. <Q>I will &s;hut the door, it may be &s;ome may come to do us a mi&s;chief.</Q> Afterwards we under&s;tood captain Keat, who commanded the party, purpo&s;ed to have done us &s;ome in|jury that night; but the door being bolted, he mi&s;&s;ed his
<PB N="219" REF="037441_0296_100D8FC046C5B808">de&s;ign. Next morning captain Keat brought a kin&s;man of his, a rude, wicked man, and put him into the room; him|&s;elf &s;tanding without. This evil-minded man walked huff|ing up and down the room; I bid him fear the Lord. Whereupon he ran upon me, &s;truck me with both his hands; and, clapping his leg behind me, would have thrown me down, if he could; but he was not able, for I &s;tood &s;tiff and &s;till, and let him &s;trike. As I looked to|wards the door, I &s;aw, captain Keat look on, and &s;ee his kin&s;man thus beat and abu&s;e me. Whereapon I &s;aid to him, 'Keat, do&s;t thou allow this?' He &s;aid he did. <Q>Is this manly or civil,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>to have us under a guard, and put a man to abu&s;e and beat us? Is this manly, ci|vil, or chri&s;tian?</Q> I de&s;ired one of our friends to &s;end for the con&s;tables, and they came. Then I de&s;ired the captain to let the con&s;tables &s;ee his warrant or order, by which he was to carry us; which he did; and his warrant was, to conduct us &s;afe to captain Fox, governor of Pen|dennis ca&s;tle; and if the governor &s;hould not be at home, he was to convey us to Lance&s;ton gaol. I told him, He had broken his order concerning us; for we, who were his pri&s;oners, were to be &s;afely conducted; but he had brought a man to beat and abu&s;e us: &s;o he having broken his or|der, I wi&s;hed the con&s;table to keep the warrant. Accord|ingly he did, and told the &s;oldiers, They might go their ways, for he would take charge of the pri&s;oners; and if it co&s;t twenty &s;hillings in charges to carry us up, they &s;hould not have the warrant again. I &s;hewed the &s;oldiers the ba&s;ene&s;s of their carriage towards us; and they walked up and down the hou&s;e, pitifully blank and down. The con&s;tables went to the ca&s;tle, and told the officers what they had done. The officers &s;hewed great di&s;like of captain Keat's ba&s;e carriage towards us; and told the con&s;tables, major-general De&s;borough was coming to Bodmin, and that we &s;hould meet him; and it was likely he would free us. Mean-while our old guard of &s;oldiers came by way of entreaty to as, and promi&s;ed they would be civil to us, if we would go with them. Thus the morning was &s;pent till about the eleventh hour; and then, upon the &s;oldiers en|treaty, and promi&s;e to be more civil, the con&s;tables gave them the order again; and we went with them. Great was the civility and courte&s;y of the con&s;tables and people of that town towards us, who kindly entertained us; and the Lord tewarded them with his truth; for many of them have &s;ince
<PB N="220" REF="037441_0297_100D8FC325FD1518">been convinced thereof, and are gathered into the name of Je&s;us, and &s;it under Chri&s;t, their Teacher and Saviour.</P>
<P>Captain Keat who commanded our guard, under&s;tanding that captain Fox, who was governor of Pendennis ca&s;tle, was gone to meet major-general De&s;borough, did not carry us thither; but took us directly to Bodmin, in the way to Lance&s;ton. We met major-general De&s;borough on the way. The captain of his troop, that rode before him, knew me, and &s;aid, 'Oh, Mr. Fox, what do you here?' I re|plied, 'I am a pri&s;oner.' 'Alack,' &s;aid he, 'for what?' I told him, 'I was taken up as I was travelling.' 'Then,' &s;aid he, <Q>I will &s;peak to my lord, and he will &s;et you at liberty.</Q> So he came from the head of his troop, and rode up to the coach, and &s;poke to the major-general. We al&s;o gave him an account how we were taken. He began to &s;peak again&s;t the light of Chri&s;t; again&s;t which I ex|horted him. Then he told the &s;oldiers, They might carry us to Lance&s;ton; for he could not &s;tay to talk with us, le&s;t his hor&s;es &s;hould take cold.</P>
<P>To Bodmin we were had that night; and when we came to our inn, captain Keat, who was in before us, put me in|to a room, and went his way. When I was come in, there &s;tood a man with a naked rapier in his hand. Whereupon I turned out again, called for captain Keat, and &s;aid, <Q>What now, Keat, what trick ha&s;t thou played now, to put me into a room where there is a man with his naked ra|pier? What is thy end in this?</Q> 'Oh,' &s;aid he, <Q>pray hold your tongue; for if you &s;peak to this man, we cannot all rule him, he is &s;o devili&s;h.</Q> 'Then,' &s;aid I, <Q>do&s;t thou put me into a room where there is &s;uch a man with a naked rapier, that thou &s;ay'&s;t, You cannot all rule him? What an unworthy, ba&s;e trick is this? and to put me &s;ingle into this room from the re&s;t of my friends, that were fellow-pri&s;oners with me?</Q> Thus his plot was di&s;covered, and the mi&s;chief they intended was prevented. Afterward we got another room, where we were together all night; and in the evening we declared the truth to the people: but they were dark and hardened. The &s;oldiers, notwith|&s;tanding their fair promi&s;es, were very rude and wicked to us again, and &s;at up drinking and roaring all night.</P>
<P>Next day we were brought to Lance&s;ton, where captain Keat delivered us to the gaoler. Now was there no friend, nor friendly people near us; and the people of the town were a dark, hardened people. The gaoler required us to
<PB N="221" REF="037441_0298_100D8FC4B75C6CA0">pay &s;even &s;hillings a week for our hor&s;e-meat, and &s;even &s;hillings a week for our diet apiece. After &s;ome time &s;eve|ral &s;ober per&s;ons came to &s;ee us, and &s;ome of the town were convinced; and many friendly people out of &s;everal parts of the country came to vi&s;it us, and were convinced. Then got up a great rage among the profe&s;&s;ors and prie&s;ts again&s;t us. They &s;aid, This people Thou and Thee all men with|out re&s;pect, and will not put off their hats, nor bow the knee to any man; but we &s;hall &s;ee, when the a&s;&s;ize comes, whether they will dare to Thou and Thee the judge, and keep on their hats before him. They expected we &s;hould be hanged at the a&s;&s;ize. But all this was little to us; for we &s;aw how God would &s;tain the world's honour and glo|ry; and were commanded not to &s;eek that honour, nor give it; but knew the honour that cometh from God only, and &s;ought that.</P>
<P>It was nine weeks from the time of our commitment to the a&s;&s;izes, to which abundance of people came from far and near to hear the trial of the Quakers. Captain Brad|den lay with his troop of hor&s;e there, who&s;e &s;oldiers and the &s;heri&s;f's men guarded us to the court through the multitude that filled the &s;treets; and much ado they had to get us through. Be&s;ides, the doors and windows were filled with people looking upon us. When we were brought into the court, we &s;tood a pretty while with our hats on, and all was quiet; and I was moved to &s;ay, <Q>Peace be among&s;t you?</Q> Judge Glyn, a Wel&s;hman then chief ju&s;tice of England, &s;aid to the gaoler, <Q>What be the&s;e you have brought here into the court?</Q> 'Pri&s;oners, my lord,' &s;aid he. 'Why do you not put off your hats?' &s;aid the judge to us. We &s;aid nothing. 'Put off your hats.' &s;aid the judge again. Still we &s;aid nothing. Then &s;aid the judge, 'The court commands you to put off your hats.' Then I queried, <Q>Where did ever any magi&s;trate, king, or judge, from Mo&s;es to Daniel, command any to put off their hats, when they came before them in their courts, either among&s;t the Jews (the people of God) or among&s;t the heathen? And if the law of England doth command any &s;uch things, &s;hew me that law either written or print|ed.</Q> The judge grew very angry, and &s;aid. <Q>I do not carry my law-books on my back.</Q> 'But,' &s;aid I. <Q>tell me where it is printed in any &s;tatute-book, that I may read it.</Q> Then &s;aid the judge, <Q>Take him away, prevaricator! I'll &s;erk him.</Q> So they took us away, and put us among
<PB N="222" REF="037441_0299_100D8FC73453CC38">the thieves. Pre&s;ently after he called to the gaoler. <Q>Bring them up again! Come,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>where had they hats from Mo&s;es to Daniel? Come, an&s;wer me; I have you fa&s;t now.</Q> I replied, <Q>Thou maye&s;t read in the third of Daniel, that the three children were ca&s;t into the fiery furnace by Nebuchadnezzar's command, with their coats, their ho&s;e, and their hats on.</Q> This plain in&s;tance &s;top|ped him; &s;o that not having any thing el&s;e to the point, he cried again, 'Take them away, gaoler.' Accordingly we were taken away, and thru&s;t in among the thieves; where we were kept a great while; and then, without being called again, the &s;heriff's men and the troopers made way for us to get through the crowd, and guarded us to pri&s;on again, a multitude of people following us, with whom we had much di&s;cour&s;e and rea&s;oning at the gaol. We had &s;ome good books to &s;et forth our principles, and to inform people of the truth; which the judge and ju&s;tices hearing of, they &s;ent captain Bradden for them, who came and vio|lently took our books from us, &s;ome out of Edward Pyot's hands, and carried them away; &s;o we never get them again.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we were had up again into the chamber by the gaoler, &s;heriff's men, and troopers; who had a mighty toil to get us through the crowd of people. When we were in the court, waiting to be called, ob&s;erving the jurymen, and &s;uch a multitude of others &s;wearing, it griev|ed my life to &s;ee, that &s;uch as profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tianity &s;hould &s;o openly di&s;obey and break the command of Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tle. And I was moved of the Lord to give forth a paper again&s;t &s;wearing, which I had about me, to the grand and petty juries.</P>
<P>Concerning SWEARING.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>TAKE heed of giving people oaths to &s;wear: for 'Chri&s;t our Lord and Ma&s;ter &s;aith, <Q>Swear not at all; but let your communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay: for what&s;oever is more than the&s;e cometh of evil.</Q> If any was to &s;uffer death, it mu&s;t be by the hand of two or three witne&s;&s;es; and the hands of the witne&s;&s;es were to be fir&s;t upon him to put him to death.

Every one of you have a light from Chri&s;t, who &s;aith, <Q>I am the light of the world,</Q> and doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world. He &s;aith, "Learn of me," who&s;e doc|trine, and that of the apo&s;tle, is not to &s;wear; <Q>Let your yea be yea, and your nay be nay, in all your com|munication; for what&s;oever is more cometh of evil:</Q> they that go into more than yea and nay go into evil, and are out of the doctrine of Chri&s;t. If you &s;ay, <Q>That the oath was the end of controver&s;y and &s;trife;</Q> tho&s;e who are in &s;trife are out of Chri&s;t's doctrine; for he is the covenant of peace, and who are in that, are in the co|venant of peace. The apo&s;tle brings that but as an ex|ample: as men &s;wearing by the greater, and the oath was the end of controver&s;y and &s;trife among men; &s;aying, Verily, men &s;wear by the greater: but God having no greater &s;wears by him&s;elf concerning Chri&s;t; who, when he was come, taught not to &s;wear at all.

<P>This paper pa&s;&s;ing among them from the jury to the ju&s;tices, they pre&s;ented it to the judge; &s;o when we were called before the judge, he bid the clerk give me that paper, and then a&s;ked me, Whether that &s;editious paper was mine? I told him, <Q>If they would read it up in open court that I might hear it, if it was mine, I would own it, and &s;tand by it.</Q> He would have had me to have taken it, and looked upon it in my own hand; but I again de&s;ired, <Q>That it might be read, that all the country might hear it, and judge whether there was any &s;edition in it or no; for if there was. I was willing to &s;uffer for it.</Q> At la&s;t the clerk of the a&s;&s;ize read it with an audible voice, that all the people might hear it. When he had done, I told them, <Q>It was my paper. I would own it; and &s;o might they too, except they would deny the &s;cripture: for was not this &s;cripture language, the words and commands of Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tle, which all true chri&s;tians ought to obey?</Q> Then they dropped that &s;ubject; and the judge &s;ell upon us about our hats again, bidding the gaoler take them off; which he did; and giving them to us, we put them on again. We a&s;ked the judge and ju&s;tices, <Q>What we had lain in pri&s;on for the&s;e nine weeks, &s;eeing they now ob|jected nothing to us but about our hats?</Q> And as for putting off our hats, I told them, <Q>That was the honour which God would lay in the du&s;t, though they made &s;o much ado about it; the honour which is of men, and which men &s;eck one of another, and is a mark of unbe|lievers,</Q> For "How can ye believe," faith Chri&s;t. <Q>who receive honour one of another, and &s;eek not the honour that co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th from God only?</Q> Chri&s;t &s;aith. <Q>I receive not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from men;</Q> and all true chri&s;tians &s;hould be 'of his mind.'

I told them, <Q>It was all fal&s;e; and &s;till we cried for ju&s;tice for our fal&s;e impri&s;omment, being taken up in our journey without cau&s;e by major Caedy.</Q> Then Peter Ceely &s;aid to the judge, <Q>May it plea&s;e you, my lord, this man (point|ing to me) went a&s;ide with me, and told me how &s;ervice|able I might be for his de&s;ign; that he could rai&s;e forty thou&s;and men at an hour's warning, involve the nation in blood, and &s;o bring in king Charles. I would have aided him out of the country, but he would not go. If it plea&s;e you, my lord, I have a witne&s;s to &s;wear it.</Q> So he called upon his witne&s;s; but the judge not being forward to ex|amine the witne&s;s, I de&s;ired, <Q>That he would be plea&s;ed to let my mittimus be read in the &s;ace of the court and coun|try, in which my crime was &s;ignified for which I was &s;ent to pri&s;on.</Q> The judge &s;aid, It &s;hould not be read.

I &s;aid, <Q>It ought to be read; for if I have done any thing worthy of death, or of bonds, let all the country know it.</Q> Then &s;eeing they would not read it, I &s;poke to one of my fellow|pri&s;oners.

<P>When it was read I &s;poke thus to the judge and ju&s;tices, <Q>Thou that &s;aye&s;t thou art chief ju&s;tice of England, and you ju&s;tices, know that, if I had put in &s;ureties, I might have gone whither I plea&s;ed, and have carried on the de|&s;ign (if I had had one) which major Ceely hath charged me with. And if I had &s;poken tho&s;e words to him, which he hath here declared, judge ye whether bail or mainprize could have been taken in that ca&s;e.</Q> Then, turning my &s;peech to major Ceely, I &s;aid, <Q>When or where did I take thee a&s;ide? Was not thy hou&s;e full of rude people, and thou as rude as any of them, at our examination; &s;o that I a&s;ked for a con&s;table or &s;ome other officer to keep the people civil? But if thou art my accu&s;er, why &s;itte&s;t thou on the bench? It is not the place of accu&s;ers to &s;it with the judge. Thou oughte&s;t to come down and &s;tand by me, and look me in the face. Be&s;ides, I would a&s;k the judge and ju&s;tices, Whether or no major Ceely is not guilty of this trea&s;on, which he charges again&s;t me in con|cealing it &s;o long as he hath done? Does he under&s;tand his place, either as a &s;oldier or a ju&s;tice of the peace? For he tells you here, <Q>That I went a&s;ide with him, and told him what a de&s;ign I had in hand, and how &s;ervice|able he might be for my de&s;ign: that I could rai&s;e forty thou&s;and men in an hour's time, bring in king Charles,
<PB N="227" REF="037441_0304_100D8FD26330BA60">and involve the nation in blood.</Q> He &s;aith moreover, <Q>He would have aided me out of the country, but I would not go; and therefore he committed me to pri&s;on for want of &s;ureties for the good behaviour,</Q> as the mittimus declares. Now do you not &s;ee plainly, that major Ceely is guilty of this plot and trea&s;on he talks of, and hath made him&s;elf a party to it, by de&s;iring me to go out of the country, demanding bail of me, and not charging me with this pretended trea&s;on till now, nor di&s;covering it? But I deny and abhor his words, and am innocent of his de|vili&s;h de&s;ign.</Q> So that bu&s;ine&s;s was let fall; for the judge &s;aw clear enough, that in&s;tead of en&s;naring me, he had en|&s;nared him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Major Ceely got up again, and &s;aid, <Q>If it plea&s;e you, my lord, to hear me: this man &s;truck me, and gave me &s;uch a blow as I never had in my life.</Q> At this I &s;miled in my heart, and &s;aid, <Q>Major Ceely, art thou a ju&s;tice of peace, and a major of a troop of hor&s;e, and telle&s;t the judge in the face of the court and country, that I, a pri|&s;oner, &s;truck thee, and gave thee &s;uch a blow as thou ne|ver had&s;t the like in thy life? What! art thou not a&s;hamed? Prithee, major Ceely, &s;aid I, where did I &s;trike thee? and who is thy witne&s;s for that? who was by? He &s;aid, It was in the Ca&s;tle-green, and captain Bradden was &s;tanding by when I &s;truck him. I de&s;ired the judge to let him produce his witne&s;s for that; and call|ed again upon major Ceely to come down from the bench, telling him, It was not fit the accu&s;er &s;hould &s;it as judge over the accu&s;ed.</Q> When I called again for his witne&s;s, he &s;aid captain Bradden was his witne&s;s. Then I &s;aid, <Q>Speak, captain Bradden, did&s;t thou &s;ee me give him &s;uch a blow, and &s;trike him as he &s;aith?</Q> Captain Bradden made no an&s;wer, but bowed his head towards me. <Q>I de|&s;ired him to &s;peak up, if he knew any &s;uch thing; but he only bowed his head again. Nay, &s;aid I, &s;peak up, and let the court and country hear; let not bowing of the head &s;erve the turn. If I have done &s;o, let the law be inflicted on me; I fear not &s;ufferings, nor death it&s;elf, for I am an innocent man concerning all his charge.</Q> But captain Bradden never te&s;tified to it. The judge, finding tho&s;e &s;nares would not hold, cried, Take him away, gaoler; and when we were taken away, he fined us twenty marks apiece for not putting off our hats; to be kept in pri&s;on till we paid it; and &s;ent us back to the gaol.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="037441_0305_100D8FD4F5A7D700">
At night captain Bradden came to &s;ee us, and &s;even or eight ju&s;tices with him who were very civil to us, and told us, They believed, neither the judge nor any in the court gave credit to tho&s;e charges which major Ceely had accu&s;ed me of in the face of the country. And captain Bradden &s;aid, Major Ceely had an intent to have taken away my life, if he could have got another witne&s;s. <Q>But &s;aid I, Captain Bradden, why did&s;t not thou witne&s;s for me, or again&s;t me. &s;eeing major Ceely produced thee for a wit|ne&s;s that thou &s;awe&s;t me &s;trike him? When I de&s;ired thee to &s;peak either for me or again&s;t me, according to what thou &s;awe&s;t or knewe&s;t, thou would&s;t not &s;peak.</Q> Why, &s;aid he, when major Ceely and I came by you, as you were walking in the Ca&s;tle-green, he put off his hat to you, and &s;aid. How do you, Mr. Fox? your &s;ervant, Sir, Then you &s;aid to him, Major Ceely, take heed of hypocri|&s;y and of a rotten heart; for when came I to be thy ma&s;ter, and thou my &s;ervant? Do &s;ervants u&s;e to ca&s;t their ma&s;ters into pri&s;on? This was the great blow he meant that you gave him. Then I called to mind that they walked by us, and that he &s;poke &s;o to me, and I to him; which hypocri&s;y and rotten-heartedne&s;s he manife&s;ted openly, when he com|plained of this to the judge in open court, and in the face of the country; whom he would have made believe that I &s;truck him with my hand.</P>
<P>Now were we kept in pri&s;on, and divers came from far and nigh to &s;ee us, of whom &s;ome were people of account in the world; for the report of our trial was &s;pread abroad, and our boldne&s;s and innocency in our an&s;wers to the judge and court was talked of in the town and country. Among others Humphry Lower came to vi&s;it us, a grave, &s;ober, ancient man, who had been a ju&s;tice of peace, and was ve|ry &s;orry we &s;hould lie in pri&s;on; telling us, how &s;erviceable we &s;hould be if we were at liberty. We rea&s;oned with him concerning &s;wearing: and having acquainted him they tendered the oath of abjuration to us as a &s;nare, becau&s;e they knew we could not &s;wear; and &s;hewed him, that no people could be &s;erviceable to God if they di&s;obeyed the command of Chri&s;t; and that they that impri&s;oned us for the hat-honour, which was of men, and which men &s;ought for, they pri&s;oned the good, and grieved the Spirit of God in them&s;elves, which &s;hould have turned their minds to him. So we directed him to the Spirit of God in his h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t, the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us: and he was thoroughly convinced,
<PB N="229" REF="037441_0306_100D8FD68EA86930">and continued &s;o to his death, and became very &s;erviceable to us.</P>
<P>There came al&s;o to &s;ee us, one colonel Rou&s;e, a ju&s;tice of peace, and a great company with him. He was full of words and talk, as ever I heard any man in my life, &s;o that without intruding, there was no &s;peaking to him. At length I a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether he had ever been at &s;chool, and knew what belonged to que&s;tions and an&s;wers?</Q> (this I &s;aid to &s;lop him.) At &s;chool! &s;aid he, yes. At &s;chool! &s;aid the &s;oldiers; Doth he &s;ay &s;o to our colonel, that is a &s;cholar? Then &s;aid I, <Q>If he be &s;o, let him be &s;till and re|ceive an&s;wers to what he hath &s;aid.</Q> Then I was moved of the Lord to &s;peak the word of life to him in God's dread|ful power; which came &s;o over him that he could not open his mouth. His face &s;welled, and was red like a turkey. His lips moved, and he mumbled &s;omething; but the peo|ple thought he would have fallen down. I &s;tept to him; and then he &s;aid, He was never &s;o in his life before; for the Lord's power &s;topped the evil power and air in him, &s;o that he was almo&s;t choked. The man was ever after ve|ry loving to friends, but not &s;o full of airy words to us; though he was full of pride: but the Lord's power came over him, and the re&s;t that were with him.</P>
<P>Another time there came an officer of the army, a very malicious, bitter profe&s;&s;or, whom I had known in London. He was full of airy talk al&s;o, and &s;poke &s;lightly of the light of Chri&s;t, and again&s;t the truth, as colonel Rou&s;e had done, and again&s;t the Spirit of God being in men, as it was in the apo&s;tles days, till the power of God that bound the evil in him had almo&s;t choked him al&s;o, as it did colonel Rou&s;e; for he was &s;o full of evil air, that he could not &s;peak; but blubbered and &s;tuttered. From that time that the Lord's power &s;truck him, and came over him, he was ever after more loving to us.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;izes being over, and we &s;ettled in pri&s;on upon &s;uch a commitment that we were not likely to be &s;oon re|lea&s;ed, we broke off from giving the gaoler &s;even &s;hillings a week apiece for our hor&s;es, and, &s;even &s;hillings a week for our&s;elves, and &s;ent our hor&s;es into the country. Upon which he grew very wicked and devili&s;h, and put us down into Doom&s;dale, a na&s;ty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">linking place, where they u&s;ed to put murderers after they were condemned. The place was &s;o noi&s;ome, that it was ob&s;erved few that went in did ever come out again in health. There was no hou&s;e of
<PB N="230" REF="037441_0307_100D8FD89C4C7608">office in it; and the excrement of the pri&s;oners, that from time to time had been put there, had not been carried out (as we were told) for many years. So that it was all like mire, and in &s;ome places to the top of the &s;hoes in water and urine; and he would not let us clean&s;e it, nor &s;uffer us to have beds or &s;traw to lie on. At night &s;ome friendly people of the town brought us a candle and a little &s;traw; and we went to burn a little of our &s;traw to take away the &s;tink. The thieves lay over our heads, and the head-gaol|er in a room by them over our heads al&s;o. It &s;eems the &s;moke went up into the room where the gaoler lay; which put him into &s;uch a rage that he took the pots of excrement from the thieves, and poured them through a hole upon our heads in Doom&s;dale, till we were &s;o be&s;pattered that we could not touch our&s;elves nor one another. And the &s;link increa&s;ed upon us; &s;o that what with &s;tink, and what with &s;moke, we had like to have been choked and &s;mother|ed. We had the &s;tink under our fect before, now we had it on our heads and backs al&s;o; and he having quenched our &s;traw with the filth he poured down, had made a great &s;mother in the place. Moreover he railed at us mo&s;t hide|ou&s;ly, calling us hatchet-faced dogs, and &s;uch &s;trange names as we had never heard of. In this manner we were obliged to &s;tand all night, for we could not &s;it down, the place was &s;o full of filthy excrement. A great while he kept us after this manner before he would let us clean&s;e it, or &s;uffer us to have any victuals brought in but what we got through the grate: One time a girl brought us a little meat; and he arre&s;ted her for breaking his hou&s;e, and &s;ued her in the town-court for breaking the pri&s;on. A great deal of trouble he put the young woman to; whereby others were &s;o di&s;|couraged that we had much ado to get water, drink, or vic|tuals. Near this time we &s;ent for a young woman, Ann Downer, from London, who could write and take things well in &s;hort-hand, to buy and dre&s;s our meat for us; which &s;he was very willing to do, it being al&s;o upon her &s;pirit to come to us in the love of God; and &s;he was very &s;ervice|able to us.</P>
<P>The head-gaoler, we were informed, had been a thief, and was burnt both in the hand and in the &s;houlder: his wi&s;e too had been burnt in the hand. The under|gaoler had been burnt both in the hand and in the &s;houl|der: his wi&s;e had been burnt in the hand al&s;o. Colonel Bennet, a bapti&s;t-teacher, having purcha&s;ed the gaol and
<PB N="231" REF="037441_0308_100D8FDA39791E98">lands belonging to the ca&s;tle, had placed this head-gaoler there. The pri&s;oners and &s;ome wild people would be talk|ing of &s;pirits that haunted Doom&s;dale, and how many had died in it, thinking perhaps to terrify us therewith. But I told them, <Q>That if all the &s;pirits and devils in hell were there, I was over them in the power of God, and feared no &s;uch thing; for Chri&s;t, our Prie&s;t, would &s;anctify the walls of the hou&s;e to us, he who brui&s;ed the head of the devil.</Q> The prie&s;t was to clean&s;e the plague out of the walls of the hou&s;e under the law, which Chri&s;t, our Prie&s;t, ended; who &s;anctifies both inwardly and outwardly the walls of the hou&s;e, the walls of the heart, and all things to his people.</P>
<P>By this time the general quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions drew nigh; and the gaoler &s;till carrying him&s;elf ba&s;ely and wickedly towards us, we drew up our &s;uffering ca&s;e, and &s;ent it to the &s;e&s;&s;ions at Bodmin. Upon the reading of which the ju&s;tices gave order. <Q>That Doom&s;dale-door &s;hould be opened, and that we &s;hould have liberty to clean&s;e it, and to buy our meat in the town.</Q> We &s;ent up a copy al&s;o of our &s;ufferings to the Protector, &s;etting forth how we were taken and com|mitted by major Ceely, and abu&s;ed by captain Keat as afore&s;aid, and the re&s;t in order. Whereupon the Protector &s;ent an order to captain Fox, governor of Pendennis-ca&s;tle; to examine the matter about the &s;oldiers abu&s;ing us, and &s;triking me. There were at that time many of the gentry of the country at the ca&s;tle; and captain Keat's kin&s;man, that &s;truck me, was &s;ent for before them, and much threat|ened. They told him, <Q>If I &s;hould change my principle, I might take the extremity of the law again&s;t him, and might recover &s;ound damages of him.</Q> Captain Keat was al&s;o check'd for &s;uffering the pri&s;oners under his charge to be abu&s;ed. This was of great &s;ervice in the country; for afterwards friends might have &s;poken in any market or &s;tee|ple-hou&s;e thereabouts, and none would meddle with them. I under&s;tood that Hugh Peters, one of the Protector's chaplains, told him, <Q>They could not do George Fox a greater &s;ervice for the &s;preading of his principles in Corn|wall than to impri&s;on him there.</Q> And indeed my impri|&s;onment there was of the Lord, and for his &s;ervice in tho&s;e parts; for aftere the a&s;&s;izes were over, and it was known we were likely to continue pri&s;oners, &s;everal friends from mo&s;t parts of the nation came into the country to vi&s;it us, Tho&s;e parts of the we&s;t were very dark countries at that
<PB N="232" REF="037441_0309_100D8FDC5381E198">time; but the Lord's light and truth broke forth, &s;hined over all, and many were turned from darkne&s;s to light, and from &s;atan's power unto God. Many were moved to go to the &s;teeple-hou&s;es, &s;everal were &s;ent to pri&s;on to us, and a great convincement began in the country: for now we had liberty to walk in the Ca&s;tle-green, and divers came to us on fir&s;t-days, to whom we declared the word of life. Great &s;ervice we had, many were turned to God up and down the country; but great rage got up in the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors again&s;t the truth and us. One of the envious profe&s;&s;ors had gathered together many &s;cripture-&s;entences to prove, <Q>That we ought to put off our hats to the peo|ple,</Q> and he invited the town of Lance&s;ton to come into the Ca&s;tle-yard to hear him read them. Among&s;t other in&s;tances that he brought, one was, <Q>That Saul bowed to the witch of Endor.</Q> When he had done we got a little liberty to &s;peak, and &s;hewed both him and the people, <Q>That Saul was gone from God, and had di&s;obeyed him, like them, when he went to the witch of Endor: that neither the prophets, nor Chri&s;t, nor the apo&s;tles ever taught people to bow to a witch.</Q> The man went away with his rude people; but &s;ome &s;taid with us, and we &s;hewed them, That this was not go&s;pel-in&s;truction, to teach people to bow to a witch. For now people began to be affected with the truth, and the devil's rage increa&s;ed; &s;o that we were often in great danger.</P>
<P>One time there came a &s;oldier, and while one of our friends was admoni&s;hing and exhorting him to &s;obriety, &amp;c. I &s;aw him begin to draw his &s;word. Whereupon I &s;tept to him, and repre&s;ented what a &s;hame it was to offer to draw his &s;word upon a naked man, and a pri&s;oner, and how unfit and unworthy he was to carry &s;uch a weapon; and that, if he &s;hould have offered &s;uch a thing to &s;ome men, they would have taken his &s;word from him and have bro|ken it to pieces. So he was a&s;hamed and went his way; and the Lord's power pre&s;erved us.</P>
<P>Another time, about eleven at night, the gaoler being half drunk, came and told me, He had got a man now to di&s;pute with me (this was when we had leave to go a little into the town.) As &s;oon as he &s;poke the&s;e words, I felt there was mi&s;chief intended to my body. All that night and the next day I lay down on a gra&s;s-plat to &s;lumber, and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;omething &s;till about my body; and I &s;tarted up, and &s;truck at it in the power of the Lord, and &s;till it was
<PB N="233" REF="037441_0310_100D8FDED37500B8">about my body. Then I ro&s;e and walked into the Ca&s;tle|green, and the under-keeper came and told me, There was a maid would &s;peak with me in the pri&s;on. I felt a &s;nare in his words too, therefore I went not into the pri&s;on, but to the grate; and looking in, I &s;aw a man that was lately brought to pri&s;on for being a conjurer, who had a naked knife in his hand. I &s;poke to him, and he threaten|ed, to cut my chaps; but being within the gaol he could not come at me. This was the gaoler's great di&s;putant. I went &s;oon after into the gaoler's hou&s;e, and found him at breakfa&s;t; he had then got his conjurer out with him. I told the gaoler, his plot was di&s;covered. Then he got up from the table, and ca&s;t his napkin away in a rage; and I left them, and went away to my chamber; for at this time we were out of Doom&s;dale. At the time the gaoler had &s;aid the di&s;pute &s;hould be, I went down and walked in the court (the place appointed) till about the eleventh hour; but no|body came. Then I went up to my chamber again; and after awhile heard one call for me. I &s;tepped to the &s;tairs|head, where I &s;aw the gaoler's wife upon the &s;tairs, and the conjurer at the bottom of the &s;tairs, holding his hand behind his back, and in a great rage. I a&s;ked him, <Q>Man, what ha&s;t thou in thy hand behind thy back?</Q> <Q>Pluck thy hand before thee,</Q> &s;aid I; 'let's &s;ee thy hand, and 'what thou ha&s;t in it? Then he angrily plucked forth his hand with a naked kni&s;e in it. I &s;hewed the gaoler's wife their wicked de&s;ign again&s;t me; for this was the man they brought to di&s;pute of the things of God. But the Lord di&s;covered their plot, prevented their evil de&s;ign; and they both raged, and the conjurer threatened. Then I was moved of the Lord to &s;peak &s;harply to him in the dreadful power of the Lord; and the Lord's power came over him, and bound him down; &s;o that he never after dur&s;t appear before me, to &s;peak to me. I &s;aw it was the Lord alone that pre&s;erved me out of their bloody hands; for the devil had a great enmity to me, and &s;tirred up his in&s;truments to &s;eek my hurt. But the Lord prevented them; and my heart was filled with thank&s;givings and prai&s;es to him.</P>
<P>Now while I was exerci&s;ed with people of divers &s;orts, that came &s;ome out of good-will to vi&s;it us, &s;ome out of an envious carping mind to wrangle and di&s;pute wi&s;h us, and &s;ome out of curio&s;ity to &s;ee us; Edward Pyot, who before his convincement had been a captain in the army, and had a good under&s;tanding in the laws and rights of the people,
<PB N="234" REF="037441_0311_100D8FE0D5E4FB00">being &s;en&s;ible of the inju&s;tice and envy of judge Glyn to us at our trial, and willing to lay the weight thereof upon him, and make him &s;en&s;ible thereof al&s;o, wrote an epi&s;tle to him, on behalf of us all, which was thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To John Glyn, chief ju&s;tice of England:</SALUTE>
<SALUTE>Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are freemen of England, free-born; our rights and liberties are according to law, and ought to be defended by it; therefore, with thee, by who&s;e hand we have &s;o long &s;uffered, and yet do &s;uffer, let us a little plainly rea&s;on concerning thy proceedings again&s;t us, whe|ther they have been according to law, and agreeable to thy duty and office, as chief mini&s;ter of the law or ju&s;tice of England? And in meekne&s;s and lowline&s;s abide, that the witne&s;s of God in thy con&s;cience may be heard to &s;peak and judge in this matter: for thou and we mu&s;t all appear before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t, that every one may receive according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Therefore, friend, in moderation and &s;o|berne&s;s weigh what is herein laid before thee.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, before we were brought before thee at the a&s;&s;ize at Lance&s;ton, thou did&s;t cau&s;e divers &s;cores of our books to be violently taken from us by armed men without due proce&s;s of law; which books being peru&s;ed, to &s;ee if any thing in them could have been found to have been laid to our charge (who were innocent men, and then upon our legal i&s;&s;ue) thou ha&s;t detained from us to this very day. Our books are our goods, our goods are our property, and our liberty it is to have and enjoy our property: and of our liberty and property the law is the defence; which &s;aith, <Q>No freeman &s;hall be di&s;&s;eized of his freehold, liberties, or free cu&s;toms, &amp;c. nor any way otherwi&s;e de&s;troyed: nor we &s;hall not pa&s;s upon him, but by lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land, Magna Charta, cap. 29.</Q> Now, friend, con&s;ider, is not the taking away of a man's goods violently, by force of arms, as afore&s;aid, contrary to the law of the land? Is not the keeping of them, &s;o taken away, a di&s;&s;eizing him of his property, and a de&s;troying of it and his liberty, yea, his very being, &s;o far as the invading of the guard the law &s;ets about him is in order thereunto? Calls not the law this a de&s;troying of a man? Is there any more than
<PB N="235" REF="037441_0312_100D8FE3D4F34800">one common guard or defence to property, liberty, and life, viz. the law? And can this guard be broken on the former, viz. property and liberty, and the latter, viz. life, be &s;ure? Doth not he, that makes an inva&s;ion upon a man's property and liberty (which he doth, who, contrary to law, which is the guard, acts again&s;t either) make an inva|&s;ion upon a man's life; &s;ince that which is the ground of the one is al&s;o of the other? If a penny or penny's worth be taken from a man contrary to law, may not by the &s;ame rule all a man hath be taken away? If the bond of the law be broken upon a man's property, may it not on the &s;ame ground be broken upon his per&s;on? And by the &s;ame rea|&s;on as it is broken on one man, may it not be broken upon all, &s;ince the liberty, property, and beings of all men under a government are relative, a communion of wealth, as the members in the body, but one guard and defence to all, the law? One man cannot be injured therein, but it redounds to all. Do not &s;uch things tend to the &s;ubver&s;ion and di&s;|&s;olution of government? Where there is no law, what is become of government? And of what value is the law made, when the mini&s;ters thereof break it at plea&s;ure upon men's properties, liberties, and per&s;ons? Can&s;t thou clear thy&s;elf of the&s;e things, as to us? To that of God in thy con&s;cience, which is ju&s;t, do I &s;peak. Ha&s;t thou acted like a mini&s;ter, the chief mini&s;ter of the law, who ha&s;t taken our goods, and yet detaine&s;t them, without &s;o much as going by lawful warrant, grounded upon due information, which in this our ca&s;e thou could&s;t not have; for none had peru&s;ed them, whereby to give thee information? Shoulde&s;t thou exerci&s;e violence and force of arms on pri&s;oners goods, in their pri&s;on-chamber, in&s;tead of proceeding orderly and legally, which thy place calls upon thee above any man to tender, defend, and maintain again&s;t wrong, and to pre|&s;erve intire the guard of every man's being, liberty, and livelihood? Should&s;t thou, who&s;e duty it is to puni&s;h the wrong-doer, do wrong thy&s;elf? Who oughte&s;t to &s;ee the law be kept and ob&s;erved, break the law, and turn a&s;ide the due adinini&s;tration thereof? Surely, from thee, con&s;ider|ing thou art chief ju&s;tice of England, other things were expected, both by us and by the people of this nation.</P>

Is it not the &s;ub&s;tance of thy office and duty, to do ju&s;tice according to the law and cu&s;tom of England?

<P>Surely friend, that mu&s;t needs be a very great offence, which deprives a man of ju&s;tice, of being heard as to wrong, of the benefit of the law, and of tho&s;e laws afore-rehear&s;ed; to defend the ju&s;tice and equity of which, a man hath adven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">red his blood and all that is dear to him. But to &s;tand covered (or with the hat on) in con&s;cience to the command of the Lord, is made by thee &s;uch an of|fence (which is none in law) and rendered upon us (who are innocent, &s;erving the living God) effectual to de|ny us ju&s;tice; though the laws of God, and of man, and the oath, and equity and rea&s;on &s;ay the contrary, and on it pronounceth &s;uch a penalty. <Q>If ye will be uncovered (Uncovered, &s;aid&s;t thou) I will hear you, and do you ju&s;tice:</Q> but ju&s;tice we had not, nor were we heard, be|cau&s;e Je&s;us, Chri&s;t, who is the higher power, the lawgiver of his people, in our con&s;ciences commanded us not to re&s;pect per&s;ons; whom to obey we choo&s;e rather than man. And for our obedience unto him ha&s;t thou ca&s;t us into pri|&s;on, and continue&s;t us there, till this very day; having &s;hewed us neither law for it, not &s;cripture, nor in&s;tances of either, nor examples of heathens or others. Friend, Come down to that of God, that is ju&s;t in thee, and con&s;ider, was there ever &s;uch a thing as this heard of in this nation? What is become of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, of true judgment, and of righteou&s;ne&s;s! An unrighteous man, &s;tanding before thee with his hat off &s;hall be heard; but an innocent man ap|pearing with his hat on in con&s;cience to the Lord, &s;hall neither he heard, nor have ju&s;tice. Is not this regarding of per&s;ons contrary to the laws afore&s;aid, and the oath, and the law of God? Under&s;tand, and judge. Did we not own authority and government oftentimes before the count? Did&s;t thou not &s;ay in the court, Thou wa&s;t glad to hear &s;o much from us of our owning magi&s;tracy? Pleaded we not to the indictment, though it was &s;uch a new-found one as England never heard of before? Came we not when thou &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t for us?

<PB N="239" REF="037441_0316_100D8FEB44144020">And are we not &s;till pri&s;oners at thy command and at thy will?

What ado ha&s;t thou made to take away the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the righteous from him, and to cau&s;e us to &s;uffer further, whom thou knewe&s;t to have been &s;o long wrongfully in pri&s;on contrary to law? Is not liberty of con&s;cience a natural right? Had there been a law in this ca&s;e, and we bound up in our con&s;ciences that we could not have obeyed it, was not liberty of con&s;cience there to take place? For where the law &s;aith not again&s;t, there needs no plea of liberty of con&s;cience: but the law have we not offended; yet in thy will ha&s;t thou cau&s;ed, and do&s;t thou yet cau&s;e us to &s;uffer for our con&s;ciences, where the law requires no &s;uch thing: and yet for liberty of con&s;cience hath all the blood been &s;pilt, and the mi&s;e|ries of the late wars undergone, and, as the protector &s;aith, this government undertaken, to pre&s;erve it; and a na|tural right, he &s;aith, it is; and he that would have it, he &s;aith, ought to give it. And if it be a natural right, as is undeniable, then to attempt to force it, or to puni&s;h a man for not doing contrary to it, is to act again&s;t nature: which as it is unrea&s;onable, &s;o it is the &s;ame as to offer violence to a man's life. And what an offence that is in the law, thou knowe&s;t; and how, by the common law of England, all acts, agreements and laws, that are again&s;t nature, are mere nullities: and all the judges cannot make one ca&s;e to be law, that is again&s;t nature. But put the ca&s;e, our &s;tanding with our hats on had been an offence in law, and we wilfully, and in contempt, and not out of con&s;cience had &s;tood &s;o (which we deny) yet that is not a ground wherefore we &s;hould be denied ju&s;tice, or to be heard, as to the wrong done to us. <Q>If ye will not offend in one ca&s;e, I will do you ju&s;tice in another:</Q> this is not the language of the law, or of ju&s;tice, which di&s;tributes to eve|ry

<P>And &s;hould&s;t thou have accu&s;ed, when no witne&s;s ap|peared again&s;t us, as in the particulars of &s;triking Peter Ceely, and di&s;per&s;ing books (as thou &s;aid&s;t) again&s;t ma|gi&s;tracy and mini&s;try, with which thou did&s;t fal&s;ely accu&s;e one of us? Saith not the law, <Q>The judge ought not to be the accu&s;er?</Q> much le&s;s a fal&s;e accu&s;er. And wa&s;t thou not &s;uch an one, in affirming, that he di&s;per&s;ed books again&s;t magi&s;tracy and mini&s;try, when the books were violently taken out of our chamber, undi&s;per&s;ed by him, or any of us? Nor did&s;t thou make it appear in one particular, wherein tho&s;e books, thou &s;o violently did&s;t cau&s;e to be taken away, were again&s;t magi&s;tracy or mini&s;|try; or gave&s;t one in&s;tance or reply, when he denied what thou charged&s;t therein; and &s;poke to thee to bring forth tho&s;e books, and make thy charge appear. Is not the &s;word of the magi&s;trate of God to pa&s;s upon &s;uch evil-do|ing? And according to the admini&s;tration of the law, ought not accu&s;ations to be by way of indictment, wherein the offence is to be charged, and the law expre&s;&s;ed, again&s;t which it is? Can there be an i&s;&s;ue without an indictment? Or can an indictment be found, before proof be made of the offence charged therein? And ha&s;t not thou herein gone contrary to the law, and the admini&s;tration thereof, and thy duty, as a judge? What ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence gave George Fox to thee, when, upon thy producing a paper concerning &s;wearing, &s;ent by him (as thou &s;aid&s;t) to the grand jury, and requiring him to &s;ay, Whether it was his hand-writing? he an&s;wered, <Q>Read it up before the country; and when he heard it read, if it were his, he would own it?</Q> Is it not equal, and according to law, that what a man is charged with before the country, &s;hould be read in the hearing of him and of the country? When a paper is delivered out of a man's hand, altera|tions may be made in it to his prejudice, which, on a &s;ud|den looking over it, may not pre&s;ently be di&s;cerned; but
<PB N="241" REF="037441_0318_100D8FF03445B2D8">by hearing it read up, may be better under&s;tood whether any &s;uch alterations have been made therein? Could&s;t thou in ju&s;tice have expected, or required him otherwi&s;e to do? Con&s;idering al&s;o, that he was not in&s;en&s;ible how much he had &s;uffered already, being innocent; and what endea|vours there were u&s;ed to cau&s;e him further to &s;uffer? Was not what he &s;aid a plain and &s;ingle an&s;wer, and &s;ufficient in the law? Though (as hath been demon&s;trated) contrary to law thou did&s;t act, and to thy office, in being his ac|cu&s;er therein, and producing the paper again&s;t him. And in his liberty it was, whether he would have made thee any an&s;wer at all to what thou did&s;t exhibit, or demand out of the due cour&s;e of law: for to the law an&s;wer is to be made; not to thy will. Wherefore then wa&s;t thou &s;o filled with rage and fury upon that his reply? Calmly, and in the fear of the Lord con&s;ider: Wherefore did&s;t thou revile him, particularly with the reproachful names of jug|gler and prevaricator? Wherein did he juggle? Wherein did he prevaricate? Wherefore did&s;t thou u&s;e &s;uch threat|ening language, and &s;uch menacings to him and us, &s;ay|ing, Thou would&s;t ferk us, with &s;uch like? Doth not the law forbid reviling, and rage, and fury, and threatening and menacing of pri&s;oners? Soberly mind; is this to act like a judge, or a man? Is not this tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion? Is not the &s;word of the magi&s;trate of God to pa&s;s on this as evil-doing, which the righteous law condemns, and the higher power is again&s;t, which judgeth for God? Take heed what ye do; for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment: <Q>Wherefore now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed, and do it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor re&s;pect of per&s;ons, nor taking of gifts,</Q> &s;aid Jeho&s;haphat to the judges of Judah. Pride, and fury and pa&s;&s;ion, and rage, and reviling, and threatening are not the Lord's: the&s;e, and the principle out of which they &s;pring, are for judg|ment, and mu&s;t come under the &s;word of the magi&s;trate of God; and of an ill favour, e&s;pecially &s;uch an expre&s;|&s;ion, as to threaten to ferk us. Is not &s;uch a &s;aying more becoming a pedant, or &s;choolma&s;ter with his rod or ferula in his hand, than thee, who art the chief ju&s;tice of the nation, who &s;itte&s;t in the highe&s;t &s;eat of judgment; who oughte&s;t to give a good example, and &s;o to judge, that others may hear and fear?

That irons and all other bonds &s;hall be taken from the pri&s;oner, that he may plead without amazement, and with &s;uch freedom of &s;pirit as if he were not a pri|&s;oner? But when he, who is to judge according to the law, &s;hall beforehand threaten and menace the pri&s;oner contrary to the law, how can the mind of the pri&s;oner be free, to plead his innocency before him? or expect equal judgment from him, who before he hears him, threatens what he will do to him? Is not this the ca&s;e between thee and us? Is not this the mea&s;ure we have received at thy hands? Ha&s;t thou herein dealt according to law? or to thy duty? or as thou would&s;t be done unto? Let that of God in thy con&s;cience judge.</P>
<P>And did&s;t not thou &s;ay, there was a law for putting off the hat; and that thou would&s;t &s;hew a law? and did&s;t not thou often &s;o expre&s;s thy&s;elf? But did&s;t thou produce any law? or &s;hew where that law might be found? or any judicial precedent, or in what king's reign, when we &s;o often de&s;ired it of thee? having never heard of or known any &s;uch law, by which thou did&s;t judge us. Was not what we demanded of thee rea&s;onable and ju&s;t? Was that a &s;avoury an&s;wer, and according to law, which thou gave&s;t us, <Q>I am not to carry the law-books at my back, up and down the country; I am not to in&s;truct you?</Q> Was ever &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion heard before the&s;e days to come out of a judge's mouth? Is he not to be of coun&s;el in the law for the pri&s;oner, and to in&s;truct him therein? Is it not for this cau&s;e that the pri&s;oner, in many ca&s;es, is not allowed coun&s;el by the law? In all courts of ju&s;tice in this nation, hath it not been known &s;o to have been? And to the pri&s;oner hath not this been often declared, when he hath demanded coun&s;el, alleging his ignorance in the law, by rea&s;on of which his cau&s;e might mi&s;carry, though it were righteous, viz. <Q>The court is of coun&s;el for you?</Q> Ought not he, that judgeth in the law, to be expert in the law?

Doth not the taking away our books as afore&s;aid, and the pe|ru&s;ing of them in &s;uch ha&s;te before our trial, and thy ac|cu&s;ing us with &s;omething which thou &s;aid&s;t was contained in them, make it appear that matter was &s;ought out of them wherewithal to charge us, when the Et Cetera war|rant would not &s;tand in law by which we were committed, and were then upon our delivery according to the due cour&s;e of law? Doth it not further appear, by thy refu|&s;ing to take from our hands a copy of the &s;trange Et Cetera warrant by which we were committed, and of the paper for which we &s;tood apprehended, to read it or cau&s;e it to be read; that &s;o our long &s;ufferings by rea&s;on of both might be looked into, and weighed in the law, whether ju&s;t or righteous, and the country might as well &s;ee our innocency and &s;ufferings without a cau&s;e, and the manner of dealing with us, as to hear &s;uch reports which went of us as great offenders, when we called upon thee often &s;o to do, and which thou oughte&s;t to have done, and &s;aid&s;t, Thou would&s;t do, but did&s;t it not; nor &s;o much as took notice before the country that we had been fal&s;ely impri&s;oned, and had wrongfully &s;uffered?

And is it not abundantly clear from thy not permitting us to an&s;wer, and clear our|&s;elves of the many foul &s;landers charged upon us in the new-found indictment, of which no proof was made? But when we were an&s;wering thereunto, and clearing our|&s;elves thereof, thou did&s;t &s;top us, &s;aying, <Q>Thou minded&s;t not tho&s;e things, but only the putting off the hat:</Q> when as before the country the new-found indictment charged us with tho&s;e things, and the petty jury brought in their verdict, <Q>Guilty of the cre&s;pa&s;les and contempts montion|ed therein;</Q> of which (except as to the hat) not one wit|ne&s;s or evidence was produced; and as to the hat, not any law or judicial precedent, upon the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of which all legal indictments are to be grounded? Now the law &s;eeks not for cau&s;es whereby to make the innocent &s;uffer; but helpeth him to right who &s;uffers wrong, re|lieveth the oppre&s;&s;ed, and &s;earcheth out the matter, Whe|ther that of which a man &s;tands accu&s;ed be &s;o or no; &s;eeking judgment and ha&s;tening righteou&s;ne&s;s: and it &s;aith, "The innocent and the righteous &s;lay thou not," But whether thou ha&s;t done &s;o to us, or the contrary, let the witne&s;s of God in thee &s;earch and judge; as the&s;e thy fruits do al&s;o make mani&s;e&s;t.</P>
<P>And, friend, con&s;ider how abominably wicked, and how highly to be abhorred, denied, and witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t, and how contrary to the laws &s;uch a proceeding is, as to charge a man with many offences in an indictment, which they who draw the indictment, they who pro&s;ecute, and they who find the bill, know to be fal&s;e, and to be put in purpo&s;ely to reproach and wound his good name; whom, with &s;ome &s;inall matter which they can prove, they charge and indict, as is the common practice at this day. Prove but one particular charge in the indictment, and it mu&s;t &s;tand (&s;ay they) for a true bill; though there be ne|ver &s;o many &s;al&s;ehoods and lies therein, on &s;et purpo&s;e to wrong him who is maliciou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted: this is known to the judges, and almo&s;t to every man who hath to do with and attends their courts. How contrary is this to the end and righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, which clears the innocent and condemns the guilty, and condemneth not
<PB N="245" REF="037441_0322_100D8FF90B477768">the righteous with the wicked! Much it is cried out of; but what reformation is there thereof? How el&s;e &s;hall clerks of a&s;&s;ize, and other clerks of courts fill up their bags (out of which perhaps their ma&s;ter mu&s;t have a &s;ecret con&s;ideration) and be heightened in pride and impudence; that even in open court they take upon them to check and revile men without reproof, when a few lines might &s;erve in&s;tead of an hundred? How el&s;e &s;hall the &s;pirit that is in men, that lu&s;teth unto envy, malice, &s;trife, and contention, be cheri&s;hed and nouri&s;hed, to feed the law|yers and dependants on courts with the bread of men's children and the ruin of their families, to maintain their long &s;uits and malicious contentions! For a judge to &s;ay, <Q>I mind not the&s;e things; I'll not hear you; clear your|&s;elves of what you are fal&s;ely accu&s;ed of: one thing I mind in your charge, the re&s;t are but matter of form, &s;et there to render you &s;uch wicked men before the country, as the thing that is to be proved again&s;t you is not &s;uf|ficient to make out.</Q> Oh! abominable wickedne&s;s, and perverting of the righteous end of the law, which is &s;o careful and tender of every man's peace and innocency! How is the law in the admini&s;tration thereof adulterated by the law|yers, as the &s;criptures are man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed by the prie&s;ts! And that which was made to pre&s;erve the righteous, and to puni&s;h the wicked, perverted to the puni&s;hing of the right|eous and the pre&s;erving of the wicked! An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, life for life, burning for burning, wound for wound, a &s;tripe for a &s;tripe; he that accu&s;eth a man fal&s;ely, to &s;uffer the &s;ame as he &s;hould have &s;uffer|ed who was fal&s;ely accu&s;ed, if he had been guilty. This &s;aith the righteous law of God; which is agreable to that of God in every man's con&s;cience. Are not &s;uch forms of iniquity to be denied, which are &s;o contrary to the law of God and man? Which &s;erve for the gender|ing of &s;trife, and the kindling of contention? And of this nature was not that, with which thou did&s;t cau&s;e us to be indicted? And this form did&s;t not thou uphold, in not permitting us to an&s;wer to the many foul &s;landers therein; &s;aying, "Tho&s;e things thou minded&s;t not?" Will not the wrath of God be revealed from heaven again&s;t all un|godline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men, who hold the truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; who are &s;o far from the power of god|line&s;s, that they have not the form, but the form of ini|quity, which is &s;et up and held up in&s;tead of and as a

Fills not up the mea&s;ure of iniquity apace? Surely the day is coming, and ha&s;teneth. Warned ye have been from the pre&s;ence, and by the mouth of the Lord; and clear will he be when he cometh to judgment, and upright when he giveth &s;entence. That of God in every one of your con&s;ciences &s;hall &s;o to him bear witne&s;s and confe&s;s, and your mouths &s;hall be &s;topped, and be|fore your judge &s;hall ye be &s;ilent, when he &s;hall divide you your portion, and render unto you according to your deeds. Therefore, whil&s;t thou ha&s;t time, prize it, and repent: for verily, <Q>Our God &s;hall come, and &s;hall not keep &s;ilence; a fire &s;hall devour before him, and it &s;hall be very tempe&s;tuous round about him.

<P>And, friend, &s;hould&s;t thou have given judgment again&s;t us (wherein thou did&s;t fine us twenty marks a-piece, and impri&s;onment till payment) without cau&s;ing us, being pri|&s;oners, to be brought before thee, to hear the judgment, and to move what we had to &s;ay in arre&s;t of judgment? Is not this contrary to the law, as is manife&s;t to tho&s;e who under&s;tand the proceedings thereof? Is not the pri&s;oner to be called before judgment be given? And is not the in|dictment to be read? and the verdict thereupon? And is not liberty to be given him to move in arre&s;t of judgment? And if it be a ju&s;t exception in the law, ought not there to be an arre&s;t of judgment? For the indictment may not be drawn up according to law, and may be wrong placed, and the offence charged therein may not be a crime in law; or the jury may have been corrupted or menaced, or &s;et on by &s;ome of the ju&s;tices; with other particulars, which are known to be legal and ju&s;t exceptions. And the judgment ought to be in the pri&s;oner's hearing, not behind his back; as if the judge were &s;o con&s;cious of the error thereof, that he dares not give it to the face of the pri&s;oner. But the&s;e privileges of the law, this ju&s;tice we
<PB N="247" REF="037441_0324_100D8FFD2FBB3D00">(who had &s;o long and &s;o greatly &s;uffered contrary to law) received not, nor could have at thy hands; no, not &s;o much as a copy or &s;ight of that long and new-found in|dictment (which in England was never heard of before, nor that the matter contained therein was an offence in law, nor ever was there any law or judicial precedent that made it &s;o) though two friends of ours, in our names and behalfs, that night, the next day, and the day following often de&s;ired it of the clerk of the a&s;&s;ize, and his a&s;&s;i&s;tant and &s;ervants; but they could not have it, nor &s;o much li|berty as to &s;ee it. And it is like it was not unknown or unperceived by thee, that, had we been called as we ought to have been, or had known when it was to be giv|en, three or four words might have made a &s;ufficient legal arre&s;t of the judgment given on that new-found indictment, and the verdict thereupon. Therefore as our liberties, who are innocent, have not in thy account been worth the minding, and e&s;teemed fit for nothing but to be trampled under foot and de&s;troyed; &s;o, if we find fault with what thou ha&s;t done, thou ha&s;t taken care that no door be left open to us in the law, but a writ of error: the con&s;idera|tion whereof, and the judgment to be given thereon, is to be had only where thy&s;elf is chief; of whom &s;uch com|plaint is to be made, and the error a&s;&s;igned for the rever&s;e of thy judgment. And what the fruit of that may be well expected to be, by what we have already mentioned as having received at thy hands, thou ha&s;t given us to un|der&s;tand.

</LETTER>
<P>By this letter the reader may ob&s;erve how contrary to law we were made to &s;uffer; but the Lord, who &s;aw the integri|ty of our hearts to him, and knew the innocency of our cau&s;e, was with us in our &s;ufferings, bore up our &s;pirits, and made them ea&s;y to us; and gave us opportunities of publi&s;hing his name and truth among&s;t the people: &s;o that &s;everal of the town came to be convinced, many were made loving to us, and friends from divers parts came to vi&s;it us; among&s;t whom were two out of Wales, who had been ju&s;|tices of peace. Judge Hagget's wife, of Bri&s;tol, came to vi&s;it us, who was convinced, with &s;everal of her children; and her hu&s;band was very kind and &s;erviceable to friends, and had a great love to God's people, which he retained to his death.</P>
<P>In Cornwall, Devon&s;hire, Dor&s;et&s;hire, and Somer&s;et|&s;hire, truth began mightily to &s;pread; many were turned to Chri&s;t Je&s;us and his free teaching: for many friends that came to vi&s;it us were drawn to declare the truth in tho&s;e
<PB N="249" REF="037441_0326_100D900112D85B28">counties; which made the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors rage, and they &s;tirred up the magi&s;trates to en&s;nare friends. They &s;et up watches in the &s;treets and highways, on pretence of taking up &s;u&s;picious per&s;ons; under which colour they &s;top|ped, and took up friends coming to vi&s;it us in pri&s;on; which they did, that they might not pa&s;s up and down in the Lord's &s;ervice. But that which they thought to have &s;topped the truth by, was the means of &s;preading it &s;o much the more; for then friends were frequently moved to &s;peak to one con&s;table, and t'other officer, and to the ju&s;tices they were brought before; which cau&s;ed the truth to &s;pread the more in all their pari&s;hes. And when friends were got among the watches, it would be a fortnight or three weeks before they could get out of them again; for no &s;ooner had one con&s;table taken and carried them before the ju&s;tices, and they had di&s;charged them, but another would take them up and carry them before other ju&s;tices: which put the country to a great deal of needle&s;s trouble and charges.</P>
<P>As Thomas Rawlin&s;on was coming out of the north to vi&s;it us, a con&s;table in Devon&s;hire took him up; and at night took twenty &s;hillings out of his pocket: and after being thus robbed he was ca&s;t into Exeter gaol. They ca&s;t Henry Pollexfen al&s;o into pri&s;on in Devon&s;hire, under pre|tence of his being a je&s;uit; who had been a ju&s;tice of peace for the mo&s;t part of forty years before. Many friends were cruelly beaten by them; nay &s;ome clothiers that were but going to mill with their cloth, and others about their out|ward occa&s;ions, they took up and whipped; though men of about eighty or an hundred pounds by the year, and not above four or five miles from their families.</P>
<P>The mayor of Lance&s;ton took up all he could, and ca&s;t them into pri&s;on. He would &s;earch &s;ub&s;tantial grave wo|men, their petticoats and their head-cloaths. A young man coming to &s;ee us, I drew up all the gro&s;s, inhuman, and unchri&s;tian actions of the mayor, gave it him, and bid him &s;eal it up, and go out again the back way; and then come into the town through the gates. He did &s;o, and the watch took him up, and carried him before the mayor; who pre|&s;ently &s;earched his pockets and found the letter; wherein he &s;aw all his actions characterized; which &s;hamed him &s;o, that from that time he meddled little with the Lord's &s;ervants.</P>
<P>From the &s;en&s;e I had of the &s;nare that was laid, and mi&s;|chief intended in &s;etting up tho&s;e watches at that time to
<PB N="250" REF="037441_0327_100D9002A4591978">&s;top and take up friends, it came upon me to give forth the following lines, as&mdash;</P>
<P>An exhortation and warning to the magi&s;trates.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL ye powers of the earth, Chri&s;t is come to reign, and is among you, and ye know him not; who doth enlighten every one of you, that ye all through him might believe in him; who is the light, who treads the wine|pre&s;s alone without the city, and who&s;e feet are upon it. Therefore &s;ee all, and examine with the light what ye are ripe for; for the pre&s;s is ready for you.</P>
<P>Before honour is humility. You that would have ho|nour before ye have humility, are ye not as the heathen are? Ye would have honour before ye have humility; did not all the per&s;ecutors that ever were upon the earth want this humility? They wanted the honour, and yet would have the honour before they had the humility, and had learned that. So ye that are out of humility, are out of the honour, and ye are not to have the honour who have not the humility; for before honour is humility: mark, before it.</P>
<P>Ye pretend liberty of con&s;cience, yet one &s;hall not carry a letter to a friend, nor men vi&s;it their friends, nor vi&s;it pri&s;oners, nor carry a book about them, either for their own u&s;e or for their friends. Men &s;hall not &s;ee their friends; but watches are &s;et up again&s;t them to catch and &s;top them: and the&s;e mu&s;t be well armed too again&s;t an innocent people, that have not &s;o much as a &s;tick in their hands, who are in &s;corn called Quakers. Yet by &s;uch as &s;et up the&s;e watches is pretended liberty of con&s;cience; who take up them who&s;e con&s;ciences are exerci&s;ed towards God and men, who wor&s;hip God in &s;pirit and truth; which they that are out of the light call here&s;y. The&s;e &s;et up watches again&s;t tho&s;e they in &s;corn call Quakers, becau&s;e they confe&s;s and witne&s;s the true light, that light|eth every one that cometh into the world, among&s;t people as they pa&s;s through the country, or among their friends. This is the dangerous doctrine which watchmen are &s;et up again&s;t, to &s;ubdue error, as they call it, which is the light that doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world; him by whom the world was made, who was glorified with the Father before the world began. For tho&s;e whom they in &s;corn call Quakers, have they &s;et up their watch|es,
<PB N="251" REF="037441_0328_100D90054A472E08">able men, well armed, to take them up that bear this te&s;timony either in words, books, or letters. So that is the light you hate, which enlightens every man that com|eth into the world; and the&s;e that witne&s;s to this light you put in pri&s;on; and after you have impri&s;oned them, you &s;et up your watches to take all up that go to vi&s;it them, and to impri&s;on them al&s;o: &s;o that by &s;etting up your watches, ye would &s;top all relief from coming to pri&s;on|ers. Therefore this is the word of the Lord God to you, and a charge to you all, in the pre&s;ence of the living God of heaven and earth: every man of you being enlighten|ed with a light that cometh from Chri&s;t, the &s;aviour of people's &s;ouls; to this light, all take heed, that with it you may &s;ee Chri&s;t from whom the light cometh, you may &s;ee him to be your Saviour by whom the world was made, who &s;aith, Learn of me. But if ye hate this light, ye hate Chri&s;t who doth enlighten you all, that through him you might believe. But not believing in the light, nor bringing your deeds to the light, which will make them manife&s;t and reprove them, this becomes your condemner, even the light. Remember you are warned in your life|time; for this light is your way to &s;alvation, if you walk in it; and this light is your condemner, if you reject and hate it. You can never come to Chri&s;t, the Second Prie&s;t, until you come to the light which the Second Prie&s;t hath enlightened you withal. So ye that come not to the light, ye go to the prie&s;ts that take tithes, as did the fir&s;t prie&s;t|hood; and &s;o hale out of your &s;ynagogues and temples as that prie&s;thood did which took tithes: which tho&s;e of the &s;econd prie&s;thood did not. Was there ever &s;uch a gene|ration! Or did ever &s;uch a generation of men appear as doth now in this age, who are &s;o full of madne&s;s, envy, and per&s;ecution, that they &s;tand up in watches, with bills and weapons, again&s;t the truth, to per&s;ecute it, as the towns and countries declare; which rings as Sodom, and like Gomorrah! And this hath its liberty, and truth is &s;tood again&s;t; to reprove &s;in is accounted a breach of the peace, as tho&s;e &s;ay who are out of the truth, and &s;et up their watches again&s;t it.</P>

Thus ye have numbered hone&s;t men, godly men, holy men, men that fear God, among beggars, rogues, and vagabonds; putting no difference between the precious and the vile. You are not fit to judge, who have &s;et up your bills, and armed your men to &s;tand up together in battle again&s;t innocent people, the lambs of Chri&s;t, who have not lifted up an hand again&s;t you. But if ye were &s;en&s;ible of the &s;tate of your own country, your cities, your towns, your villages, how the cry of them is like Gomorrah, the ring like Sodom, and the &s;ound like the old world, where all fle&s;h had corrupted its way, which God overthrew with the flood; if you did con&s;ider this with your&s;elves, you would find &s;ome|thing to turn the &s;word again&s;t, and not again&s;t the lambs of Chri&s;t, and not make a mock of the innocent, that &s;tand a witne&s;s again&s;t all &s;in and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in your towns and &s;teeple-hou&s;es.

And now your fruits appear, the end of your reli|gion and profe&s;&s;ion, and what you po&s;&s;e&s;s; but you are in the error, and have been but in the profe&s;&s;ion, out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Spirit, who are not in the Spirit of truth. For where did that ever &s;et bounds, and number the ju&s;t and innocent with the wicked? But the wicked &s;et bounds and limits to the ju&s;t, and numbered them among the wicked; yea, all manner of evil they &s;poke of them, as ye are doing now of us. According as it was foretold in the &s;cripture, &s;uch as tremble at the word of God, you ca&s;t out and hate, you that have your temple-wor&s;hip. You &s;ay, the Quakers come to di&s;turb you in your churches. Was it not the practice of the apo&s;tles to go into the &s;yna|gogues and temples, to witne&s;s again&s;t the prie&s;thood that took tythes? Was it not the practice of the Jews to hale them out, per&s;ecute them, and &s;tone them, that witne&s;&s;ed Chri&s;t the &s;econd prie&s;t, and went to bring people off from the fir&s;t prie&s;thood? Was it not the practice of the prophets to go and cry again&s;t the high places? And was it not the practice of the Jews, when they were back-&s;lid|den, and of the heathen, to impri&s;on and per&s;ecute the prophets, and &s;end after them into other countries? Is not this your practice now, who are holding up your high places erected by the Papi&s;ts, which ye now call your churches; where ye beat and per&s;ecute? What kind of re|ligious people are you, that are filled with &s;o much mad|ne&s;s? Did not Paul confe&s;s he was mad while he was in your practice, haling, beating, pri&s;oning, putting out of the &s;ynagogues, having his authority from the chief prie&s;ts? And are not the chief prie&s;ts the cau&s;e of this? Was there ever &s;uch a cry made in any age pa&s;t, as there is now in the pulpits, railing again&s;t an innocent people, who lift not up an hand again&s;t you; and who are indeed the pi|ous, that are of the pure religion, who fear God, and
<PB N="254" REF="037441_0331_100D900B2C15C440">wor&s;hip him in the Spirit and in the truth, but cannot join with you in your religion? Do not the mini&s;ters of God &s;ay, that the &s;criptures are a declaration, which you call the word? Do not you rob Chri&s;t of his title, and of his honour, and give it to the letter, and &s;hew your&s;elves out of the doctrine of the mini&s;ters of God, who called the &s;criptures by the name of writings and treati&s;es, and declarations; and &s;aid, Chri&s;ts name is called the Word of God? Are not you here in the error you &s;peak of, which is common talk among you? There was talk among &s;ome of you of your go&s;pel-&s;hining. Doth the go&s;|pel per&s;ecute? Did ever any of tho&s;e that did po&s;&s;e&s;s it ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and not &s;uffer others to vi&s;it them? Are you like Chri&s;tians in this, or like heathen, who &s;et bounds and watches over the land, that they &s;hould not pa&s;s to vi&s;it tho&s;e in pri&s;on? Was ever the like heard in any age? Search and &s;ee, if you have not out&s;tript them all in your watches, if not in your manner of per&s;ecution, and in your impri&s;onments. Oh! never talk that we are a grief to them that are in the pure religion.</P>
<P>And whereas in your warrant we are repre&s;ented as di&s;af|fected to government; I &s;ay, the law, that is a terror to the evil-doer, we own; the higher power, to which the &s;oul mu&s;t be &s;ubject; but we deny the evil-doer, the malicious man reigning, and the envious man &s;eeking for his prey, who&s;e envy is again&s;t the innocent; who rai&s;eth up the country again&s;t hone&s;t men, and &s;o becomes a trouble to the coun|try, in rai&s;ing them up to take the innocent: but that we leave to the Lord to judge. Your fal&s;e accu&s;ations of here&s;y and bla&s;phemy we deny. You &s;hould have laid them down in particulars, that people might have &s;een them; and not have &s;landered us behind our backs. The law &s;aith, The crime &s;hould be mentioned in the warrant. Then for your &s;aying. <Q>We deny the godly mini&s;ters to be a true mini&s;try of Chri&s;t;</Q> that is fal&s;e; for we &s;ay, The godly mini&s;ters are the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. But which of your mini&s;ters dare &s;ay that they are cruly godly? And for your charging us with &s;educing many weak peo|ple, that is fal&s;e al&s;o; we &s;educe none. But you, that deny the light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, are &s;educed from the anointing which &s;hould teach you; and if ye would be taught by it, ye would not need that any man &s;hould teach you. But &s;uch as are taught by the anointing which abideth in them, and deny
<PB N="255" REF="037441_0332_100D900CE4582748">man's teaching, the&s;e ye call &s;educers, quite contrary to John's doctrine, 1. Joh. 2. That which is truth, ye call &s;educing; and that which he calls &s;educing, you call truth. Read the latter part of the chapter. I warn you all from the Lord God of glory, &s;et not any bound again&s;t him. Limit not the Holy One of I&s;rael; for the Lord is ri&s;ing in power and great glory, who will rule the nations with a rod of iron, which to him are but as the drop of a buck|et. He that mea&s;ures the waters in the hollow of his hand, will da&s;h nations together as a potter's ve&s;&s;el. And know, you that are found in this his day bla&s;pheming his work which he hath brought forth, calling it bla&s;phemy, fighting again&s;t it, &s;etting up your carnal weapons, making your bonds &s;trong; God will break a&s;under that which your carnal policy hath invented, and which by your car|nal weapons ye would uphold, and make you know there is a God in heaven, who carries his lambs in his arms, which are come among wolves, and are ready to be torn in pieces in every place, yea, in your &s;teeple-hou&s;es; where people have appeared without rea&s;on and natural affection. Therefore all ye petty con&s;tables, &s;heriffs, and ju&s;tices, take warning; take heed what ye do again&s;t the lambs of Chri&s;t; for Chri&s;t is come, and coming, who will give to every one of you a reward according to your works, you that have the letter, which &s;peaks of Chri&s;t; who are per&s;ecuting that which the &s;cripture &s;peaks of: &s;o your fruits make you manife&s;t. Therefore every one, &s;heriffs, ju&s;tices, con&s;tables, &amp;c. con&s;ider what ye po&s;&s;e&s;s, and what a profe&s;&s;ion ye are now in, that all the&s;e carnal weapons are &s;et up again&s;t the innocent, yea, again&s;t the truth; which &s;hews, that ye have not the &s;piritual wea|pons: and that ye want the coun&s;el of Gamaliel, yea, ye want the coun&s;el of &s;uch a man among you, who &s;aid, <Q>Let the apo&s;tles alone: if it be of God, it will &s;tand; if it be not, it will come to nought.</Q> But ye may &s;ee your&s;elves, on the contrary, in the &s;pirit of them that came with Judas, with &s;words and &s;taves from the chief prie&s;ts again&s;t Chri&s;t: &s;till it is again&s;t Chri&s;t, where he is made manife&s;t. Paul (while Saul) went again&s;t him, though he and the Jews profe&s;&s;ed a Chri&s;t that was to come: yet Paul per&s;ecuted him, where he was manife&s;ted in his &s;aints. So ye profe&s;s a Chri&s;t that is come, but per&s;ecute him where he is manife&s;t. You that have the letter, the high places, the &s;ynagogues, you per&s;ecute

<P>When I had &s;ent abroad the foregoing, &s;o great a &s;en&s;e came upon me of the veil of darkne&s;s that was over the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, that I was moved to give forth the following, as an awakening warning to them:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>BLINDNESS hath happened to the profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;|tians of the letter now-a-days, as blindne&s;s happen|ed to the Jews; who profe&s;&s;ed the letter, but owned not the life, which the letter &s;peaks of: as the chri&s;tians now, to whom this blindne&s;s hath happened, who profe&s;s the &s;cripture, but own not the life which the &s;cripture &s;peaks of. For again&s;t the life the Jews &s;tood, who profe&s;&s;ed the letter of the &s;cripture; but they were blind, they gathered coun&s;el again&s;t the life: they were in an uproar, when the babe was born in Bethlehem, Herod and all the chief prie&s;ts. And Herod &s;ought to de&s;troy all the young chil|dren in Bethlehem, yet mi&s;&s;ed the babe; Herod, that fox, though he put John to death. You may &s;ee here, how the literal profe&s;&s;ors &s;tood up, not for the truth, but quite again&s;t it. Furthermore, the chief prie&s;ts con&s;ulted together how they might take Je&s;us by &s;ubtilty, and put him to death; mark, by their &s;ubtilty. The profe&s;&s;ors of a Chri&s;t that was to come, they preached of a Me&s;&s;ias, of a Chri&s;t, of a Saviour; but denied the life. When he was made manife&s;t, the chief prie&s;ts, who were gathered together with the council, &s;aid, His di&s;ciples had &s;tolen him away by night; and gave large &s;ums of money to the &s;oldiers to declare this. Likewi&s;e in the day, when the children of I&s;rael were in Egypt, and they with their children began to &s;pread and multiply, "Come." &s;aid the Egyptians. <Q>let us deal wi&s;ely with them to afflict them, and tax them:</Q> which held till the Lord overthrew their oppre&s;&s;ors, and brought his &s;eed by his mighty power from under the oppre&s;&s;or, and exalted his &s;on above all;
<PB N="257" REF="037441_0334_100D9011206DE528">though the heathen raged, and the people imagined vain things. He made his power known, that all might &s;ee that there was no God upon the earth but him&s;elf. This power now hath brought forth the work of the Lord! Many, who are turned to the light, Chri&s;t, have received the power of God, and are thereby become the &s;ons of God. Now this birth, that is born <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God, are the powers of the world joined together to crucify; to put to death tho&s;e Jews in the Spirit, as they put Chri&s;t to death in the fle&s;h formerly. This is the birth that all the wicked world is enraged again&s;t. Again&s;t this they &s;et their watch|es, this birth, brought forth by the mighty God of Jacob, who rides upon the high places of the earth. This is the birth that the profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians without the life in our days rage again&s;t, and lay out all their wi&s;dom about. Are not the chief prie&s;ts and wi&s;e men of the earth con|&s;ulting together how they may de&s;troy this birth? Is not this the birth that is bani&s;hed out of your hearts, you that profe&s;s the &s;cripture, and are talkers of it, but do not own the light and life which the &s;cripture &s;peaks of, as the Jews would not; and &s;o will not have Chri&s;t to reign over you, as they would not? Do you not hale out of your &s;ynagogues, and before magi&s;trates? Do you not herein fulfil Chri&s;t's words, who &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, They &s;hould be haled out of the &s;ynagogues, and before rulers? Do you not per&s;ecute them from city to city? Do you not almo&s;t &s;ill your pri&s;ons with them? And now &s;et your watches, that none &s;hould vi&s;it them, whom you have put into pri&s;on? Is not this an unchri&s;tian &s;pirit? How can you for &s;hame &s;ay, you are upholders of truth? Or how can you for &s;hame &s;ay, that truth hath been profe&s;&s;ed among you? We grant that you have talked of it. And how can you for &s;hame &s;ay, <Q>The go&s;pel &s;hines among you,</Q> when you will not own it, the life of it; when you call it error, and the evil &s;eed? Yea, the very truth, the very life of truth ye have bla&s;phemed again&s;t now, as the Jews did again&s;t Chri&s;t, calling him a devil; you now call it error, and the evil &s;eed, and &s;tand up again&s;t it, and turn the &s;word again&s;t it. It was the Jews in their days who turned the &s;word again&s;t Chri&s;t; &s;o it is in the&s;e days the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;cripture, but out of the life that gave it forth; as tho&s;e were the Jews outward in the fle&s;h, not the Jews in the Spirit. Is it not a &s;hame to the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel (as they are called) that they
<PB N="258" REF="037441_0335_100D9012F6317190">'can find no better way to maintain that which they call the truth, and their go&s;pel, than by carnal weapons, &s;tocks, pri&s;ons, whips, watches, and wards, and powers of the earth? Were the&s;e the apo&s;tles weapons? Carnal watches, &s;tocks, pri&s;ons, and halings out of the &s;ynagogues, when they came to &s;peak? Judge your&s;elves, what an antichri&s;tian p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">it you have. Never talk of defending truth with that which is again&s;t truth. For are you not &s;etting up the rabble of the world again&s;t it? Do they not join with you, with &s;words and &s;taves again&s;t it? Is this the life of chri&s;tians? Is not this the life of error, and of the evil &s;eed&s;man? Surely ye would find work enough, if ye were in the fear of the Lord, to turn your &s;words again&s;t the profanene&s;s, the oaths and wickedne&s;s, that are in your &s;treets and highways. How do they ring like Sodom, and give a &s;ound like Gomorrah! But the&s;e are become a prey in this age, that reprove in your gate &s;in, wickedne&s;s, and profanene&s;s. They are become your by|word. Again&s;t them your councils are gathered, them you ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and hale them out of your &s;yna|gogues: and ca&s;t them likewi&s;e into pri&s;on that write and &s;peak again&s;t it; and &s;et your guards to &s;top and hinder any from vi&s;iting them whom you ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and give them the names of vagabonds and wanderers. Was ever the like heard in the days of the heathen again&s;t the apo&s;|tles, who, witne&s;&s;ed the go&s;pel? Did they &s;et guards and watches in every town, in every city, to take the di&s;ciples, the brethren, the believers, that heard the apo&s;tles were ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and came to &s;ee what they wanted? Shew ye not as much rage and fury now in your age, as was in tho&s;e in that age? How can you talk of the go&s;pel, and of defending the go&s;pel, when you are &s;etting guards and watches again&s;t it, are defending that which &s;tands again&s;t it; and the lambs of Chri&s;t are almo&s;t torn to pieces among&s;t you, who are like wolves? for the Lord hath now &s;ent his lambs among wolves. Have not you profe&s;&s;ed the words of Chri&s;t, the prophets and apo&s;tles, as the Jews had long profe&s;&s;ed the &s;criptures, the words of Mo&s;es, and the prophets, that prophe&s;ied of Chri&s;t then to come; and &s;tood again&s;t him when he was come? as you do in this day of his reign, in this day of his glorious go&s;pel, who are per&s;ecuting the me&s;&s;engers of it, impri|&s;oning them, per&s;ecuting them in your &s;treets and high|ways, and &s;etting up your watches again&s;t them who bring
<PB N="259" REF="037441_0336_100D9014E7ABDA70">the glad tidings of peace to your &s;ouls; who&s;e feet are beautiful atop of the mountains; mark, atop of the moun|tains; that again&s;t which the mountains rage and &s;well; but God will make them to melt; the Sun is ri&s;en, which will make them to melt. God will cleave the rocks and mountains a&s;under, and make the hills to bow perpetual|ly; for his Son he will exalt, and his glory he will give to him, and not to another. Therefore be awakened, ye rulers of the earth, and take coun&s;el of the Lord. Take not coun&s;el together again&s;t him. Make not your bonds &s;trong. Set not your&s;elves in battle again&s;t him: for ye will be found but as briers and thorns before him, which the fire &s;hall con&s;ume. Therefore be awakened, all ye talkers of the &s;cripture, that gather your&s;elves together by your multitudes and meetings, and have had your teach|ers; but not having the Spirit that gave forth the &s;crip|tures, the Lord God of glory, the Father of &s;pirits, will &s;catter you. All your bonds will not hold you together, who are out of the Spirit, which is the bond of peace. The thre&s;hing in&s;trument is gone forth, which will beat the hills to pieces. Sion is ri&s;en to thre&s;h. Out of the ho|ly mountain is the trumpet &s;ounded. Stand not up again&s;t the Lord: for all nations are to him as the drop of a buck|et. He that mea&s;ures the waters in the hollow of his hand, and weighs the earth in &s;cales, the Lord of Ho&s;ts is his name, who is now ri&s;en and ri&s;ing, to plead the cau&s;e of the innocent, and is exalting his Son, and bringing his &s;heep to him. Now are they &s;een and known, that feed upon wind, that are lifted up, given up to believe lies; who report, and &s;ay, "Report, and we will report it." Now are they &s;een, who have a form of godline&s;s, but deny the power: &s;o Chri&s;t is denied; for Chri&s;t is the power of God. And the power being denied by you, that have a form of godline&s;s, and the words of the &s;crip|tures; the go&s;pel is denied: for the go&s;pel is the power of God. Thus it is among you that have the knowledge and wi&s;dom that is &s;en&s;ual, earthly, and devili&s;h. Doth it not appear &s;o? Let your gaols and watches witne&s;s your fruits in every town. Your wi&s;dom is earthly, &s;en|&s;ual, and devili&s;h. You have a knowledge and wi&s;dom, but not that which is from above; for that is pure and gentle, &s;o is not your knowledge. But to know Chri&s;t, is life eternal. Your fruits have manife&s;ted, that you are not of this; and &s;o out of the power of God, which
<PB N="260" REF="037441_0337_100D901736A46F10">is the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t; for you are found in the world, out of the power of God, out of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, per&s;ecuting. So that which doth per&s;ecute, and &s;end forth writings and decrees to &s;top and take up all, and &s;et watches, and prepare bonds to limit the Lord; to im|pri&s;on and per&s;ecute, and &s;uffer none to go and vi&s;it them: this &s;hews you are not chri&s;tians, but &s;tand again&s;t the chri&s;tian life, which brings to love enemies. Where is your love to your enemies who are thus per&s;ecuting your friends? <Q>He came to his own, and his own re|ceived him not.</Q> Here is a turning the &s;word again&s;t the ju&s;t. Do you &s;hew here a chri&s;tian's life, or your&s;elves chri&s;tians, who are filling your gaols with the chri&s;tians in the Spirit, you that are in the letter (in &s;hadows) as the Jews in the letter did, put the Jews in the Spirit into pri&s;on? Is not this the fruit in our days of chri&s;tians in the letter, to put chri&s;tians in the Spirit into pri&s;on? Doth not this &s;hew that your decrees, which you have &s;ent forth, proceed from death, who thus act again&s;t the life, and them that are in it; which the &s;criptures were given forth from? Is it not here, as it was with Saul, when he went to per&s;ecute, to hale to pri&s;on, and bind all that he could &s;ind calling upon that name, who were chri&s;tians in the life, the Spirit, &s;uch as you are per&s;ecuting, becau&s;e they are in the life, though you profe&s;s their words? Are not your decrees gone forth from the &s;ame &s;pirit of envy, again&s;t the &s;ame Spirit of Chri&s;t they were in? Is it not manife&s;t to all that fear God, and to the &s;ober-minded and hone&s;t-hearted people, that &s;ee your practices, your decrees, your letters, to &s;top, to mole&s;t, to hinder, to impri&s;on them that are moved of the Lord to do his will, or to go to vi&s;it pri&s;oners whom you have impri&s;oned? Doth this &s;hew you to have a &s;pirit like Paul, yea, or nay? Are you not quite contrary, like them that per&s;ecuted Paul? The day hath declared it. To that of God in you all I &s;peak, which &s;hall witne&s;s it at the la&s;t day, the day of judgment. Per&s;ecution was blind in all ages; and mad|ne&s;s and folly led it: yet per&s;ecution got always a form or pretence of godline&s;s, a talk of religion, as in the days of Mo&s;es, of Jeremy, of Chri&s;t, and of the apo&s;tles. "Come," &s;aith the council, <Q>let us cru&s;h them while they are young, they have almo&s;t over&s;pread the nation in every corner.</Q> This is as much as to &s;ay. <Q>Let us put this birth to death, as Pharaoh and Herod did the chil|dren.</Q>
<PB N="261" REF="037441_0338_100D9019264D6B80">But the Lord cau&s;ed his truth the more to &s;pread. For you may read what numbers came out of Egypt! and what multitudes followed Chri&s;t!

<P>We were continued in pri&s;on till the next a&s;&s;ize; before which divers friends, both men and women, were &s;ent to pri&s;on, who had been taken by the watches.

Elizabeth Trelawny of Plymouth (daughter of one called a baronet) being convinced, the prie&s;ts, profe&s;&s;ors, and &s;ome great per&s;ons of her kindred, were exa&s;perated, and wrote letters to her. She being a wi&s;e and tender woman, and fearing to give them any advantage, &s;ent their letters to me; which I an&s;wered, and returned them to her again, for her to &s;end the an&s;wers to them. Which &s;he did: till growing in the power, Spirit, and wi&s;dom of God, &s;he be|came able to an&s;wer the wi&s;e&s;t prie&s;t and profe&s;&s;or of them
<PB N="262" REF="037441_0339_100D901AD5AD9750">all; and had dominion over them in the truth, through the power of the Lord, by which &s;he was kept faithful to her death.</P>
<P>While I was in pri&s;on here, the Bapti&s;ts and Fifth mo|narchy-man prophe&s;ied. That this year Chri&s;t &s;hould come, and reign upon earth a thou&s;and years. And they looked upon this reign to be outward: when he was come inwardly in the hearts of his people, to reign and rule; where the&s;e profe&s;&s;ors would not receive him. So they failed in their prophecy and expectation, and had not the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him. But Chri&s;t is come, and doth dwell and reign in the hearts of his people. Thou&s;ands, at the door of who&s;e hearts he hath been knocking, have opened to him; and he is come in, and doth &s;up with them, and they with him; the heavenly &s;upper with the heavenly and &s;piritual man. So many of the&s;e Bapti&s;ts and Monarchy|people turned the greate&s;t enemies to the followers of Chri&s;t: but he reigns in the hearts of his &s;aints over all their envy.</P>
<P>At the a&s;&s;ize divers ju&s;tices came to us, and were pretty civil, and rea&s;oned of the things of God &s;oberly; expre&s;|&s;ing a pity to us. Captain Fox, governor of Pendennis Ca&s;tle, came and looked me in the &s;ace, and &s;aid never a word; but went to his company, and told them, <Q>He ne|ver</Q> &s;aw a &s;impler man in his life. I called after him and &s;aid, 'Stay, man, we will &s;ee who is the &s;impler man.' But he went his way. A light chaffy per&s;on.</P>
<P>Thomas Lower al&s;o came to vi&s;it us, and offered us money, which we refu&s;ed; accepting neverthele&s;s of his love. He a&s;ked us many que&s;tions concerning our deny|ing the &s;criptures to be the word of God; concerning the &s;acraments, and &s;uch like: to all which he received &s;atis|faction. I &s;poke particularly to him; and he afterwards &s;ud. My wars were as a &s;la&s;h of lightning, they ran &s;o through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. He &s;aid. He never met with &s;uch men in his life, for they knew the thoughts of his heart; and were as the wi&s;e ma&s;ter-builders of the a&s;&s;emblies, that fa&s;lened their words like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. He came to be convinced of the truth, and remans a friend to this day.

<P>About this time I was moved to give forth the following exhortation to friends in the mini&s;try:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the power of life and wi&s;dom, and dread of the Lord God of life, and heaven and earth, dwell; that in the wi&s;dom of God over all ye may be pre&s;erved, and be a terror to all the adver&s;aries of God, and a dread, an&s;wer|ing that of God in them all, &s;preading the truth abroad, awakening the witne&s;s, confounding the deceit, gathering up out of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion into the life, the covenant of light and peace with God. Let all nations hear the &s;ound by word or writing. Spare no place, &s;pare no tongue, nor pen; but be obedient to the Lord God: go through the work; be valiant for the truth upon earth; tread and trample upon all that is contrary. Ye have the power, do not abu&s;e it; and &s;trength and pre&s;ence of the Lord; eye it, and the wi&s;dom; that with it you may all be ordered to the glory of the Lord God. Keep in the dominion; keep in the power over all deceit; tread over them in that, which lets you &s;ec to the world's end, and the utmo&s;t parts of the earth. Reign and rule with Chri&s;t, who&s;e &s;ceptre and throne are now &s;et up, who&s;e dominion is over all to the ends of the earth; who&s;e dominion is an everla&s;ting dominion, his throne an everla&s;ting throne, his kingdom an everla&s;ting kingdom, his power above all powers. Therefore this is the word of the Lord to you all: "Keep in the wi&s;dom of God," that &s;preads over all the earth; the wi&s;dom of the creation, that is pure from above, not de&s;tructive. For now &s;hall &s;alvation go out of Zion, to judge the mount of E&s;au; now &s;hall the law go forth from Jeru&s;alem, to an&s;wer the principle of God in all; to hew down all inventors and inventions. For all the princes of the earth are but as air to the pow|er of God, which you are in, and have ta&s;ted of: there|fore live in it, that is the word of the Lord to you all; do not abu&s;e it; keep down and low; and take heed of fal&s;e joys, that will change.</P>
<P>Bring all into the wor&s;hip of God. Plow up the fallow ground. Thre&s;h and get out the corn; that the &s;eed, the wheat, may be gathered into the barn: that to the begin|ning all people may come; to Chri&s;t, who was before the
<PB N="264" REF="037441_0341_100D901F59A59510">world was made. For the chaff is come upon the wheat by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. He that treads it out is out of tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion, fathoms tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, puts a difference between the precions and the vile, can pick out the wheat from the tares, and gather into the garner; &s;o brings to the lively hope the immortal &s;oul into God, out of which it came. None wor&s;hip God but who come to the principle of God, which they have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. None are plowed up but he who comes to the principle of God in him, that he hath tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. Then he doth &s;ervice as to God; then is the planting, watering, and increa&s;e from God. So the mini&s;ters of the Spirit mu&s;t mini&s;ter to the Spirit that is in pri&s;on, which hath been in captivity in|every one; that with the Spirit of Chri&s;t people may be led out of captivity up to God, the Father of Spirits, to &s;erve him, and have unity with him, with the &s;criptures, and one with another. This is the word of the Lord to you all, a charge to you all in the pre&s;ence of the living God; Be patterns, be examples in all countries, places, i&s;lands, nations, where-eyer you come; that your life and conduct may preach among all &s;orts of people, and to them. Then you will come to walk cheerfully over the world, an&s;wering that of God in every one; whereby in them ye may be a ble&s;&s;ing, and make the witne&s;s of God in them to ble&s;s you: then to the Lord God you &s;hall be a &s;weet &s;avour, and a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Spare no deceit. Lay the Sword upon it; go over it. Keep your&s;elves clear of the blood of all men, either by word or writing, and keep your&s;elves clean, that you may &s;tand in your throne, and every one have his lot and &s;tand in the lot in the Ancient of days. The ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord be with you, and keep you over all the idolatrous wor&s;hips and wor&s;hippers. Let them know the living God; for teachings, churches, wor&s;hips. mu&s;t be thrown down with the power of the Lord God, &s;et up by man's carthly under&s;tanding, knowledge, and will. All this mu&s;t be thrown down with that which gave forth the &s;crip|ture; and who are in that, reign over it all. That is the word of the Lord to you all. In that is God wor&s;hipped, that brings to declare his will, and brings to the church in God, the ground and pillar of truth: for now is the mighty day of the Lord appeared, and the arrows of the Almighty gene forth; which &s;hall &s;tick in the hearts of the wicked. Now will I ari&s;e, &s;aith the Lord God Al|mighty,
<PB N="265" REF="037441_0342_100D902147685CC0">to trample and thunder down deceit, which hath long reigned and &s;tained the earth. Now will I have my glory out of every one. The Lord God Almighty over all in his &s;trength and power keep you to his glory, that you may come to an&s;wer that of God in every one. Pro|claim the mighty day of the Lord of fire and &s;word, who will be wor&s;hipped in &s;pirit and in truth; and keep in the life and power of the Lord God, that the inhabitants of the earth may tremble before you: that God's power and maje&s;ty may be admired among hypocrites and hea|thens, and ye in the wi&s;dom, dread, life, terror, and domi|nion pre&s;erved to his glory; that nothing may rule or reign but power and life it&s;elf, and in the wi&s;dom of God ye may be pre&s;erved in it. This is the word of the Lord God to you all. The call is now out of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the Spirit bids, Come. The call is now from all fal&s;e wor|&s;hips and Gods, from all inventions and dead works, to &s;erve the living God. The call is to repentance, to amendment of life, whereby righteou&s;ne&s;s may be brought forth, which &s;hall go throughout the earth. Therefore ye that be cho&s;en and faithful, who are with the Lamb, go through your work faithfully in the &s;trength and power of the Lord, and be obedient to the power; for that will &s;ave you out of the hands of unrea&s;onable men, and pre|&s;erve you over the world to him&s;elf. Hereby you may live in the kingdom that &s;tands in power, which hath no where glory and life is.</P>

<P>After the a&s;&s;izes, the &s;heriff. with &s;ome &s;oldiers, came to guard a woman to execution that was &s;entenced to die; and we had a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e with them. One of them wickedly &s;aid, <Q>Chri&s;t was as pa&s;&s;ionate a man as any that lived upon the earth.</Q> For which wicked &s;aying we re|buked him. Another time we a&s;ked the gaoler, what do|ings there were at the &s;e&s;&s;ions? He &s;aid, &s;mall matters, only about thirty for ba&s;tardy. We thought it very &s;trange that they, who profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, &s;hould make &s;mall matters of &s;uch things. But this gaoler was very bad him&s;elf. I often admoni&s;hee him to &s;obricty; but he would abu&s;e people that came to vi&s;it us. Edward Pyot had a chee&s;e &s;ent him by his wife from Bri&s;tol; and the gaoler took the chee&s;e from him, and carried it to the mayor, to fearch it for trea&s;onable letters, as, he &s;aid: and though they
<PB N="266" REF="037441_0343_100D9022DB1C0488">found no trea&s;on in the chee&s;e, they kept it from us. This gaoler might have been rich, if he had carried him&s;elf civil|ly; but he fought his own ruin. which &s;oon after came upon him: for the next year he was turned out of his place, and for &s;ome wickedne&s;s was ca&s;t into the gaol him&s;elf; and there begged of our friends. And for &s;ome unruline&s;s in his carriage, he was by the &s;ucceeding gaoler put into Doom&s;dale, locked in irons, beaten, and bid to <Q>remember how he had abu&s;ed tho&s;e good men, whom he had wick|edly, without any cau&s;e, ca&s;t into that na&s;ty pri&s;on:</Q> and told, <Q>That now he de&s;ervedly &s;hould &s;uffer for his wicked|ne&s;s, and the &s;ame meature he had meted to others, he &s;hould have meted out to him&s;elf.</Q> He became very poor, and died in pri&s;on. His wife and family came to mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>While I was in pri&s;on at Lance&s;ton, a friend went to Oliver Cromwel, and offered him&s;elf, body for body, to lie in Doom&s;dale in my &s;tead; if he would take him, and &s;et me at liberty. Which thing &s;o &s;truck him, that he &s;aid, to his great men and council; <Q>Which of you would do &s;o much for me, if I were in the &s;ame condition?</Q> And though he did not accept of the friend's offer, but &s;aid, 'He could not do it, for it was contrary to law;' yet the truth thereby came mightily over him. A good while after this he &s;ent down major general De&s;borow pretending to &s;et us at liberty. When he came, he offered, if we would &s;ay, 'We would go home and preach no more,' we &s;hould have our liberty; but we could not promi&s;e him. Then he urged, that we &s;hould promi&s;e <Q>to go home if the Lord permitted:</Q> whereupon Edward Pyot wrote him this following letter:</P>

<P>THOUGH much might be &s;aid as to the liberty of Engli&s;hmen to travel in any part of England, it be|ing as the Engli&s;hman's hou&s;e by the law, and he to be protected in any part of it; and if he tran&s;gre&s;s the law, the penalty upon the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or is to be in&s;licted. And as to the liberty of con&s;cience, which is a natural right, and a fundamental, and the exerci&s;e of it by tho&s;e who profe&s;s &s;aith in God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, it is to be protected, as by the in&s;trument of government it appears, though
<PB N="267" REF="037441_0344_100D9024CED370D0">they differ in doctrine, wor&s;hip, and di&s;cipline; provided that liberty extend not to property, or prelacy, nor to li|centiou&s;ne&s;s. Where the&s;e rights are denied us, our liber|ties are infringed, which are the price of much blood and trea&s;ure in the late wars. Yet in the power of God over all, by which all are to be ruled, are we, and in it dwell, and by it alone are guided to do the will of God; who&s;e will is free, and we, in the freedom of his will, walk by the power, either as it commands or permits, without any condition or enforcement thereunto by men; but as the power moves, either by command or permi&s;&s;ion. And although we cannot covenant or condition to go forth of the&s;e parts, or to do this or that thing, if the Lord permit (for that were to do the will of man by God's permi&s;&s;ion) yet it is like we may pa&s;s forth of the&s;e parts in the liberty of the will of God, as we may be &s;everally moved and guided by the pure power, and not of nece&s;&s;ity. We who were fir&s;t committed were pa&s;&s;ing homeward when we were apprehended; and, as far as I know, we might pa&s;s, if the pri&s;on doors were commanded to be opened, and we freed of our bonds. Should we &s;tay, if the Lord com|mands us to go, or &s;hould we go if the Lord command us to &s;tay; or having no command to &s;tay, but being permitted to pa&s;s from hence, the pure power moving thereto, and we yet &s;tay; or go, when as before com|manded to &s;tay; we &s;hould then be wanderers indeed; for &s;uch are wanderers, who wander out from the will and power of God, abroad, at large, in their own wills and earthly minds. And &s;o, in the fear of the Lord God, well weigh and con&s;ider, with the ju&s;t weight and ju&s;t balance, that ju&s;tice thou may&s;t do to the ju&s;t and inno|cent in pri&s;on.</P>

<P>WE who are in the power of God, the ruler of all, the upholder of all things, and know and dwell in his power, to it we mu&s;t be obedient; which brings us to

To &s;ay, <Q>We will if the Lord permit,</Q> in a ca&s;e of buying and &s;elling to get gain, if the intent be &s;o to do, may be done; but we &s;tanding in the power of God to do his will, and to &s;tand out of man's will, if man propo&s;e, <Q>We &s;hall have our liberty if we will &s;ay, we will go to our outward be|ing, if the Lord permit, or if it be the will of God;</Q> and becau&s;e we cannot &s;ay the&s;e words in this ca&s;e, &s;hall not have our liberty, when we know that the will of God is, we &s;hall "go to &s;peak at &s;ome other place:" here we can|not &s;ay the&s;e words truly. For to &s;ay, <Q>We will go to our outward habitation, if it be according to the will of God,</Q> when we know the will of God is otherwi&s;e; we cannot &s;peak &s;o, truly and clearly. Neither can any man &s;ay &s;o to him, that requires it of him; who &s;tands in the pow|er, and knows the power of God to lead him, according to ;God's will, and it leads him to another prace than his out|ward home. But the Son of God, who came to do and did the will of God, had no place whereon to lay his head: and the apo&s;tles, and many of the followers of Chri&s;t, had no certain dwelling-place. Now if the&s;e &s;hould have been re&s;trained, becau&s;e they could not &s;ay they would go to their outward homes, if it were the will of God, when they knew it was the will of God they &s;hould not, and they could not do the will of God in doing &s;o, and there|fore could not &s;peak tho&s;e words to &s;atisfy man's mind and will, would not &s;uch re&s;traint have been evil? Abraham could not do the will of God, but in going from his native country; and who are of faith are of Abraham, of whom Chri&s;t came according to the fle&s;h. Now, if you allege, "This is to let all loo&s;e and at liberty to idlene&s;s," I &s;ay, No: &s;uch as are in the power of God, who do the will of God, come to receive his wi&s;dom, by which all his crea|tures were created, and by which they are u&s;ed to his glo|ry. This I &s;hall &s;ay, whoever are moved by the Lord God of glory and power to go to their outward habitati|ons, &s;uch of us may go to our outward homes; and there be diligent in &s;erving the Lord, that they may be a ble&s;|&s;ing from God in their generation; diligently &s;erving him in life and doctrine, in manners, in conver&s;ation, in all things. And who are moved of the Lord to go to any other place, we &s;tanding in his will, and being moved by his power, which comprehends all things, and is not to be limited, we &s;hall do his will which we are commanded to
<PB N="269" REF="037441_0346_100D902907F0C2B8">do. So the Lord God open your under&s;tandings, that you may &s;ee this great power of the Lord, which he is now manife&s;ting among his children in this his day; that ye may not with&s;tand it in our friends, that are come into the power of God, and to God, and know him by whom the world was made, by whom all things were created that were created, and there was not any thing made but what was made for him, and to him, and by him; who is the power of God, and doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world. Friends being come to this light which cometh from Chri&s;t, and having received power from him by whom all things were created, to whom all power in heaven and earth is given, who is the wi&s;dom of God; we have received wi&s;dom and power from him, by which the Lord doth give us to know how to u&s;e and order the crea|tures to the glory of him, the Creator of all things. Friends here are taught of the Lord to be diligent, &s;erving him; and who come into the life, the &s;criptures were given forth from, are given up to &s;erve the Lord. Of this I have in all your con&s;ciences a witne&s;s. So, if thou open the pri|&s;on-door, we &s;hall not &s;tay there.

<P>After this major De&s;borow came to the Ca&s;tle-green, and played at bowls with the ju&s;tices and others. Several friends were moved to go and admoni&s;h them again&s;t '&s;pending time &s;o vainly;' de&s;iring them to con&s;ider, <Q>That though they profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to be chri&s;tians, yet they gave them&s;elves up to their plea&s;ures, and kept the &s;ervants of God mean-while in pri&s;on;</Q> and al&s;o told them, <Q>The Lord would plead with them, and vi&s;it them for &s;uch things.</Q> But notwith&s;tanding what was wrote or &s;aid to him, he went away, and left us in pri&s;on. We under&s;tood afterwards that he left the bu&s;ine&s;s to colonel Bennet, who had the command of the gaol. For &s;ome time after Bennet would have &s;et us at liberty, if we would have paid his gaol|er's
<PB N="270" REF="037441_0347_100D902B40AC0AF8">fees. But we an&s;wered, <Q>We could give the gaoler no fees, for we were innocent &s;ufferers; how could they ex|pect ;fees of us, who had &s;uffered &s;o long wrongfully?</Q> After awhile colonel Bennet coming to town &s;ent for us to an inn, and in&s;i&s;ted again upon fees, which we refu&s;ed. At la&s;t the power of the Lord came &s;o over him, that the thir|teenth of the &s;eventh month, 1656, we were &s;et at liberty.

<P>Ob&s;erving while I was here pri&s;oner how much the peo|ple (they e&s;pecially who were called gentry) were addicted to plea&s;ures and vain recreations, I was moved, before I left the place, to give forth &s;everal papers as a warning to them, and to all that &s;o mi&s;pend their time.

God &s;pared not the old world; but re&s;erving Noah, a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s, brought the flood upon the world of the ungodly, making them an example to all that after &s;hould live ungodly. Mark, ye ungodly ones, who are as natural brute bea&s;ts, who &s;peak great &s;welling words of vanity, alluring through the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, through much wantonne&s;s, as they that count it plea&s;ure to riot in the day-time, &s;porting your&s;elves with your own deceiv|mgs; ye &s;hall receive the reward of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.

<P>Another, upon my taking notice of the bowlers that came to &s;port in the Ca&s;tle-green, was as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE word of the Lord to all you vain and idle mind|ed people, who are lovers of &s;ports, plea&s;ures, fooli&s;h exerci&s;es, and recreations, as you call them; con&s;ider of your ways, what it is you are doing. Was this the end of your creation? Did God make all things for you, and you to &s;erve your lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures? Did not the Lord make all things for you, and you for him&s;elf, to fear and wor|&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth, in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s? But where is your &s;ervice of God, &s;o long as your hearts run after lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures? ye cannot &s;erve God and the fooli&s;h plea&s;ures of the world, as bowling, drinking, hunting, hawking, and the like. If the&s;e have your hearts, God will not have your lips. Con&s;ider, for it is true. Therefore from the Lord mu&s;t you all witne&s;s wo and mi&s;ery, tribulation and wrath, who continue in the love and practice of your vain &s;ports, lu&s;ts, and plea|&s;ures. Now is the day, when all every-where are exhort|ed to repentance. O fooli&s;h people, wicked and flow of heart to believe the threatenings of the great Jehovah again&s;t the wicked! What will you do in the day of the Lord's fierce wrath, that makes ha&s;te to come upon the world of ungodly men! What good have your fooli&s;h &s;ports and delights done you, now they are pa&s;t? Or what good will they do you, when the Lord calls for your &s;ouls? Therefore all now awake from &s;leep, and &s;ee where you are; and let the light of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that &s;hines in every one of your con&s;ciences, &s;earch you thoroughly, and it will let you clearly &s;ee, for all your profe&s;&s;ion of God, Chri&s;t, and the &s;criptures, you are ignorant of them, and enemies to them all, and your own &s;ouls al&s;o; and being
<PB N="272" REF="037441_0349_100D902F4C0ABBB0">found living in plea&s;ures, you are dead while you live. Therefore doth the Lord by many me&s;&s;engers forewarn you; and calls you to repentance and deep humiliation; that you may for&s;ake the evil of your doings, own this day of your vi&s;itation, and while you have time prize it; le&s;t the things which belong to your peace be hid from your eyes for your di&s;obedience and rebellion again&s;t the Holy One. And then it had been good that you never had been born: repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. A|gain I &s;ay, Repent!</P>

<P>Being relea&s;ed, we got hor&s;es, rid towards Humphry Lower's, and met him upon the road. He told us, <Q>He was much troubled in his mind concerning us, and could not re&s;t at home; but was going to colonel Bennet to &s;eek our liberty.</Q> When we told him, <Q>We were &s;et at liber|ty, and were going to his hou&s;e;</Q> he was exceeding glad. To his hou&s;e we went, and had a fine, precious meeting; many were convinced, and turned by the Spirit of the Lord to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t's teaching.</P>
<P>From his hou&s;e we went to Loveday Hambley's; where we had a fine large meeting. The Lord's power was over all; many were convinced there al&s;o, and turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their teacher.</P>
<P>After we had tarried there two or three days, we came to Thomas Mounce's, where we had a general meeting for the whole county; which, being very large, was held in his orchard. Friends from Plymouth were there, and from many places. The Lord's power was over all, and a great convincement there was in many parts of the county. Their watches were down, and all was plain and open; for the Lord had let me &s;ee, before I was at liberty, that he would make all the country plain before us. Thomas and Ann Curtis, with an alderman of Reading who was con|vinced, had come to Lance&s;ton to &s;ee us while I was pri|&s;oner; and when Ann and the other man returned, Thomas Curtis &s;taid behind in Cornwall, and had good &s;ervice for the Lord at that time.</P>
<P>From Thomas Mounce's we pa&s;&s;ed to Lance&s;ton again, and vi&s;ited the little remnant of friends that had been rai&s;ed up there while we were in pri&s;on; and the Lord's plants
<PB N="273" REF="037441_0350_100D9031416D47B8">grew finely, and were e&s;tabli&s;hed on Chri&s;t, their rock and foundation. As we were going out of town again, the con&s;table of Lance&s;ton came running to us with the chee&s;e that had been taken from Edward Pyot; which they had kept from us all this while, and were troubled with it. But we, being now at liberty, would not receive it.</P>
<P>From Lance&s;ton we came to Okington; and lay at an inn, which the mayor of the town kept. He had &s;topped and taken up &s;everal friends, but was very civil to us; and was convinced in his judgment.</P>
<P>From thence we came to Exeter, where many friends were in pri&s;on; and among&s;t the re&s;t James Nayler. For a little before we were &s;et at liberty, James had run out into imaginations, and a company with him, who rai&s;ed up a great darkne&s;s in the nation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James Nayler was a monument of human frailty. His gift in the mini&s;try was eminent; his experience in divine things truly great. He &s;ell through unwatchfulne&s;s, but was re&s;tored through deep &s;ufferings and anfeigned repentance. His own writings are the mo&s;t clear and lively de|&s;cription of the various di&s;pen&s;ations he underwent: &s;ome of them de&s;erve to be tran&s;mitted to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</NOTE> He came to Bri&s;tol, and made a di&s;turbance there. From thence he was coming to Lance&s;ton, to &s;ee me; but was &s;topped by the way, and impri&s;oned at Exeter; as were &s;everal others, one of whom, an hone&s;t, tender man, died in pri&s;on there; who&s;e blood lieth on the heads of his per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>The night that we came to Exeter, I &s;poke with James Nayler: for I &s;aw he was out, and wrong, and &s;o was his company. The next day, being fir&s;t-day, we went to vi&s;it the pri&s;oners, and had a meeting with them in the pri&s;on; but James Nayler, and &s;ome of them could not &s;tay the meeting. There came a corporal of hor&s;e into the meeting, who was convinced, and remained a very good friend. The next day I &s;poke to James Nayler again; and he &s;lighted what I &s;aid, was dark, and much out; yet he would have come and ki&s;&s;ed me. But I &s;aid, <Q>Since he had turned again&s;t the power of God, I could not receive his &s;hew of kindne&s;s. The Lord moved me to &s;light him, and to &s;et the power of God over him.</Q> So after I had been war|ring with the world, there was now a wicked &s;pirit ri&s;en among&s;t friends to war again&s;t. I admoni&s;hed him and his company. When he was come to London, his re&s;i&s;ting the power of God in me, and the truth that was declared to him by me, became one of his greate&s;t burdens. But
<PB N="274" REF="037441_0351_100D90333791EBF0">he came to &s;ee his out-going, and to condemn it; and after &s;ome time he returned to truth again: as in the printed re|lation of his repentance, condemnation, and recovery may be more fully &s;een.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed from Exeter through Cullumpton and Taun|ton, vi&s;iting friends; and had meetings among&s;t them. From thence we came to Puddimoor, to William Beaton's; where on a fir&s;t-day we had a very large meeting. A great convincement there was up and down that country; many meetings we had, and the Lord's power was over all; many were turned, by the power and Spirit of God, to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who died for them, and came to &s;it under his free teaching.</P>
<P>From thence we went to John Dando's, where we had another precious meeting. The Lord's power was over all, and many were convinced of God's eternal truth. Some contention was rai&s;ed by profe&s;&s;ors and Bapti&s;ts, in &s;ome places; but the Lord's power came over them. From thence we came to Edward Pyot's, near Bri&s;tol. It was, the &s;eventh-day at night that we came thither. It was quickly noi&s;ed over the town that I was come. I had never been there before.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t-day morning I went to the meeting in Broadmead at Bri&s;tol; which was large and quiet. Notice was given of a meeting to be in the afternoon in the orchard. There was at Bri&s;tol a rude Bapti&s;t, named Paul Gwin, who had u&s;ed before to make great di&s;turbance in our meetings; be|ing encouraged by the mayor, who, as was reported, would &s;ometimes give him his dinner to encourage him. Such multitudes of rude people would he gather after him, that it was thought there had been &s;ometimes ten thou&s;and peo|ple at our meeting in the orchard. As I was going into the orchard, the people told me, That Paul Gwin, the rude, jangling Bapti&s;t, was going to the meeting. I bid them, "Never heed; it was nothing to me, who went to it." When I was come into the orchard, I &s;tood upon the &s;tone that friends u&s;ed to &s;tand on when they &s;poke: and was moved of the Lord to put off my hat, and to &s;tand a pretty while; and let the people look at me; for &s;ome thou&s;ands of people were there. While I thus &s;tood &s;ilent, this rude Bapti&s;t began to find fault with my hair; but I &s;aid nothing to him. Then he ran on into words; and at la&s;t, <Q>Ye wi&s;e mon of Bri&s;tol,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I &s;trange at you that you will &s;tand here, and hear a man &s;peak and affirm that which
<PB N="275" REF="037441_0352_100D9035B4E467C0">he cannot make good.</Q> Then the Lord opened my mouth (for as yet I had not &s;poken a word) and I a&s;ked the peo|ple, <Q>Whether they ever heard me &s;peak: or ever &s;aw me before?</Q> And bid them <Q>take notice what kind of man this was that &s;hould &s;o impudently &s;ay among&s;t them, that I &s;poke and affirmed that which I could not make good; and yet neither he nor they ever heard me or &s;aw me before. Therefore that was a lying, envious, malicious &s;pirit that &s;poke in him; and it was of the devil, and not of God. I charged him in the dread and power of the Lord to be &s;ilent; and the mighty power of God came over him, and all his company. A glorious, peaceable meeting we had; the word of life was divided among&s;t them; and they were turned from darkne&s;s to light, and to Je&s;us their Saviour. The &s;criptures were largely opened to them; and the traditions, rudiments, ways, and doctrines of men were laid open before the people, and they were turned to the light of Chri&s;t, that with it they might &s;ee them, and &s;ee him to lead them out of them. I opened al&s;o to them the types, figures, and &s;hadows of Chri&s;t in the time of the law; and &s;hewed them, That Chri&s;t was come, and had ended the types, &s;hadows, tythes, and oaths, and put down &s;wearing, and had &s;et yea and nay in&s;tead of it, and a free mini&s;try: for he was now come to teach people him&s;elf, and his heavenly day was &s;pringing from on high.</Q> For many hours did I declare the word of life among&s;t them in the eternal power of God; that by him they might come up into the beginning and be reconciled to him. And having turned them to the Spirit of God in them&s;elves, that would lead into all truth, I was moved to pray in the mighty power of God; and the Lord's power came over all. When I had done, this fellow began to babble again; and John Audland was moved to bid him repent, and fear God. So his own people and followers being a&s;hamed of him, he pa&s;&s;ed away, and never came again to di&s;turb the meeting. The meeting broke up qui|etly. and the Lord's power and glory &s;hined over all: a ble&s;&s;ed day it was, and the Lord had the prai&s;e. After awhile this Paul Gwin went beyond &s;ea; and many years after, I met with him again at Barbadoes: of which in its place.</P>
<P>From Bri&s;tol we returned to Edward Pyot's, where we had a great meeting. The Lord's power was over all, truth was declared and &s;pread abroad, and many were turn|ed
<PB N="276" REF="037441_0353_100D903818AA8788">to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, their life, their Prophet to teach them, their Shepherd to feed them, and their Bi&s;hop to over&s;ee them. After the meeting I had rea&s;oning with &s;ome pro|fe&s;&s;ors; and the Lord's truth and power came over them.</P>
<P>From Edward Pyot's we pa&s;&s;ed to Slattenford, where we had a very large meeting (Edward Pyot and another friend being &s;till with me;) and a great turning of people there was to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t their teacher. People were glad that they were brought to know their way, their free teacher, and their Saviour Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t-day following we went to Nathaniel Crips's hou&s;e, who had been a ju&s;tice of peace in Wilt&s;hire; where it was &s;uppo&s;ed between two and three thou&s;and people were at a meeting, and all was quiet. <Q>The mighty power of God was manife&s;t, and people were turned to the grace and truth in their hearts, that came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which would teach them to deny all ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly and godly in this pre&s;ent world. So that every man and woman might know the grace of God, which had appeared to all men, which was &s;aving, and &s;ufficient to bring their &s;alvation. This teacher, the grace of God, would teach them how to live, what to do, and what to deny: it would &s;ea&s;on their words, and e&s;ta|bli&s;h their hearts. This was a free teacher to every one of them: &s;o that they might come to be heirs of this grace, and of Chri&s;t, by whom it came; who hath ended the prophets, and the prie&s;ts that took tythes, and the Jewi&s;h temple. And as for the&s;e hireling prie&s;ts that take tythes now, and their temples (which prie&s;ts were made at &s;chools and colleges of man's &s;etting up, and not by Chri&s;t) they, with all their inventions, were to be de|nied. For the apo&s;tles denied the true prie&s;thood and which God had commanded, after Chri&s;t had put an end thereto. The &s;criptures, and the truths therein contained, were largely opened, and the people turned to the Spirit of God in their hearts; that by it they might be led into all truth, under&s;tand the &s;criptures, know God and Chri&s;t, and come to have unity with them, and one with another in the &s;ame Spirit.</Q> The people went away generally &s;atisfied, and were glad that they were turned to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, their Teacher and Saviour.</P>
<P>The next day we went to Marlborough, where we had a little meating. The &s;e&s;&s;ions being held that day, they were granting a warrant to &s;end for me; but ju&s;tice Stooks,
<PB N="277" REF="037441_0354_100D9039A9F1C718">being at the &s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;topped them, telling them there was a meeting at his hou&s;e ye&s;terday, at which were &s;everal thou&s;ands. So the warrant was &s;topped, our meeting was quiet; and &s;everal received Chri&s;t Je&s;us their teacher, and came into the new covenant, and abode in it.</P>
<P>From hence we went to Newbury, where we had a large ble&s;&s;ed meeting; &s;everal were convinced. Thence we pa&s;&s;|ed to Reading, where we had a large, precious meeting in the Lord's power among&s;t the plants of God. Many of other profe&s;&s;ions came in, were reached, and added to the meeting. All was quiet, and the Lord's power was over all. We went from Reading to King&s;ton upon Thames, where a few came to us that were turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: but &s;ince it is become a large meeting.</P>
<P>Leaving King&s;ton, we rode to London. When we came near Hyde Park, we &s;aw a great concour&s;e of people, and looking towards them, e&s;pied the protector coming in his coach. Whereupon I rode to his coach &s;ide. Some of his life-guard would have put me away; but he forbad them. So I rode by his coach &s;ide with him, <Q>declaring what the Lord gave me to &s;ay to him, of his condition, and of the &s;ufferings of friends in the nation; &s;hewing him, how contrary this per&s;ecution was to Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, and to chri&s;tianity.</Q> When we were come to James's Park Gate, I left him; and at parting he de&s;ired me to come to his hou&s;e. The next day, one of his wife's maids, who&s;e name was Mary Sanders, came to me at my lodging, and told me, Her ma&s;ter came to her, and &s;aid, he would tell her &s;ome good news. When &s;he a&s;ked him, What it was? He told her, George Fox was come to town. She replied, That was good news indeed (for &s;he had re|ceived truth) but &s;he &s;aid, She could hardly believe him; till he told her how I met him, and rode from Hyde Park to James's Park with him.</P>
<P>After a little time Edward Pyot and I went to White|hall; and when we came before him, Dr. Owen, vice|chancellor of Oxford, was with him. We were moved to <Q>&s;peak to Oliver Cromwel concerning the &s;ufferings of friends, and laid them before him: and directed him to the light of Chri&s;t, who had enlightened every toan that cometh into the world. He &s;aid; It was a ratural light; but we &s;hewed him the contrary; and manife&s;ted that it was divine and &s;piritual, proceeding from Chri&s;t the &s;pi|ritual and heavenly man; and that which was called the
<PB N="278" REF="037441_0355_100D903BA0B76D60">life in Chri&s;t the Word, was called the light in us. The power of the Lord God aro&s;e in me, and I was moved in it to bid him lay down his crown at the feet of Je&s;us.</Q> Several times I &s;poke to him to the &s;ame effect. I was &s;tanding by the table, and he came and &s;at upon the table's &s;ide by me, &s;aying, He would be as high as I was: and &s;o continued &s;peaking again&s;t the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and went his way in a light manner. But the Lord's power came over him, &s;o that when he came to his wife and other company, he &s;aid, 'I never parted &s;o from them before:' for he was judged in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>After he had left us, as we were going out, many great per&s;ons came about us; one of them began to &s;peak again&s;t the light, and again&s;t the truth; and I was made to &s;light him, for &s;peaking &s;o lightly of the things of God. Where|upon one of them told me he was the major-general of Northampton&s;hire. 'What!' &s;aid I, <Q>our old per&s;ecutor, that has per&s;ecuted and &s;ent &s;o many of our friends to pri|&s;on, and is a &s;hame to chri&s;tianity and religion! I am glad I have met with thee,</Q> &s;aid I. So I was moved to &s;peak &s;harply to him of his unchri&s;tian carriages; and he &s;lunk away: for he had been a cruel per&s;ecutor in North|ampton&s;hire.</P>
<P>After I had vi&s;ited the meetings of friends in and about London, I went into Buckingham&s;hire, and Edward Pyot was with me; and in &s;everal places in that county many received the truth. Great meetings we had, and the Lord's power was eminently manife&s;ted. I pa&s;&s;ed through North|ampton&s;hire and Nottingham&s;hire into Lincoln&s;hire. After &s;everal meetings in Lincoln&s;hire, I had at la&s;t a meeting, where two knights, one called Sir Richard Wrey, the other Sir John Wrey, with their wives, were at the meeting. One of then wives was convinced, received the truth, and died in it. When the meeting was done, we pa&s;&s;ed away; and it being in the evening, and dark, a company of wild &s;erving men encompa&s;&s;ed ine about, with intent, as I ap|prehended, to have done me &s;ome mi&s;chief. But I &s;poke aloud to them, and a&s;ked, 'What are ye? highwaymen? Whereupon &s;ome friends and friendly people behind came up to us, and knew &s;ome of them. So I reproved them for their uncivil and rude carriage, exhorted them to fear God, and the Lord's power came over them, and &s;topped their mi&s;ehievous de&s;ign; ble&s;&s;ed be his name for ever.</P>
<P>Then I turned into Huntingdon&s;hire. The mayor of
<PB N="279" REF="037441_0356_100D903DE81DED90">Huntingdon came to vi&s;it me, and was very loving, and his wife received the truth.</P>
<P>Thence I pa&s;&s;ed into Cambridge&s;hire, and into the Fen Country; where I had many meetings, and the Lord's truth &s;pread. Robert Craven (who had been &s;heriff of Lincoln) Amor Stoddart, and Alexander Parker were with me. We went to Crowland, a very rude place; for the town's people were got together at the inn we went to, and were half drunk, both prie&s;t and people. <Q>I reproved them for their drunkenne&s;s, and warned them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all the wicked; exhort|ing them to leave their drunkenne&s;s, and turn to the Lord in time.</Q> Whil&s;t I was thus &s;peaking to them, and &s;hew|ing the prie&s;t the fruits of his mini&s;try, the prie&s;t and the clerk broke out into a rage, and got up the tongs and fire|&s;hovel at us; &s;o that had not the Lord's power pre&s;erved us, we might have been murdered among&s;t them. Yet, for all their rudene&s;s and violence, &s;ome received the truth then; and have &s;tood in it ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>From thence we pa&s;&s;ed to Bo&s;ton, where mo&s;t of the chief of the town came to our inn, and the people &s;eemed to be much &s;atisfied. But there was a raging man in the yard; and Robert Craven was moved to &s;peak to him, and told him, He &s;hamed chri&s;tianity; which, with &s;ome few other words, &s;o &s;topped the man, that he went away quiet. Some were convinced there al&s;o.</P>
<P>Thus we had large meetings up and down; for I travel|led into York&s;hire, and returned out of Holderne&s;s, over Humber, vi&s;iting friends; and then going into Leice&s;ter|&s;hire, Stafford&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire, and Warwick&s;hire, among friends. I had a meeting at Edge-hill. There came to it Ranters, Bapti&s;ts, and &s;everal &s;orts of rude people; for I had &s;ent word about three weeks before, to have a meeting there; &s;o that hundreds of people were gathered, and many friends came from far to it. The Lord's ever|la&s;ting truth and word of life reached over all; rude and unruly &s;pirits were chained down; and many that day were turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by his power and Spirit, who came to &s;it under his ble&s;&s;ed free teaching, and to be fed with his eternal, heavenly food. All was peaceable; the people pa&s;&s;ed quietly away, and &s;ome of them &s;aid, It was a mighty, powerful meeting: for the pre&s;ence of the Lord was felt, and his power and Spirit among&s;t them.</P>
<P>From hence I pa&s;&s;ed to Warwick, and to Bagley; hav|ing
<PB N="280" REF="037441_0357_100D90404E5BEB28">precious meetings. From thence into Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, and &s;o to Oxford, where the &s;cholars were very rude; but the Lord's power came over them, and great meetings we had up and down, as we travelled. Then I went to colo|nel Grimes's, where was a very large meeting; and from thence to Nathaniel Crips's, where came another ju&s;tice to the meeting, who was al&s;o convinced. At Cirence&s;ter al&s;o we had a meeting, which is much increa&s;ed; &s;o we came to Eve&s;ham again, where I met John Camm.</P>
<P>Thus having travelled over mo&s;t part of the nation, I returned to London, having cleared my&s;elf of that which lay upon me from the Lord. For after I was relea&s;ed out of Lance&s;ton gaol, I was moved of the Lord to travel over mo&s;t parts of the nation (the truth being now &s;pread, and finely planted in mo&s;t places) that I might an&s;wer, and re|move out of the minds of people &s;ome objections, which envious prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors had rai&s;ed and &s;pread concern|ing us. For, what Chri&s;t &s;aid of fal&s;e prophets and anti|chri&s;ts coming in the la&s;t days, that they applied to us; and &s;aid, We were they.</P>
<P>Therefore was I moved to open this through the nation, and to &s;hew, 'That they, who &s;aid we were the fal&s;e pro|phets, antichri&s;ts, and deceivers, that &s;hould come in the la&s;t days, were indeed them&s;elves they. For when Chri&s;t told his di&s;ciples in the viith and xxivth of Matthew, that fal&s;e prophets and antichri&s;ts &s;hould come in the la&s;t times, and, if it were po&s;&s;ible, &s;hould deceive the very elect, he &s;aid, <Q>By their fruits ye &s;hall know them: for they &s;hould be inwardly ravening wolves, having the &s;heeps cloathing. And,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thi&s;tles?</Q> as much as to &s;ay, Their nature and &s;pirit &s;hould be like a thorn, or like a thi&s;tle; and he bids his di&s;ciples not go after them. But before the di&s;ciples were decea&s;ed, the antichri&s;ts, fal&s;e prophets, and deceivers were come. For John in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle &s;aid, <Q>Little children, it is the la&s;t time; and as ye have heard that antichri&s;t &s;hall come, even now are there many antichri&s;ts, whereby we know that it is the la&s;t time.</Q> So here, as Chri&s;t &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, They &s;hould come; the di&s;ciples &s;aw they were come: as may be &s;een at large in Peter. Jude, John, and other places of &s;cripture; "whereby," &s;ays John, "we know it is the la&s;t time:" and this la&s;t time began above &s;ixteen hundred years &s;ince. John &s;aid <Q>They went out from us;</Q> the fal&s;e prophets, antichri&s;ts, &s;educers, and
<PB N="281" REF="037441_0358_100D9041E0DE5A38">deceivers, went out from the church; "But you," &s;aid he to the church, <Q>have an anointing which abideth in you; and you need not that any man teach you, but as the &s;ame anointing teacheth you of all things; and as it hath taught you, ye &s;hall abide in him.</Q> Chri&s;t &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, <Q>Go not after them, for they are inwardly ra|vening wolves;</Q> and John exhorts the &s;aints to the anointing within them; and the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles ex|hort the churches to the grace, the light, the truth, the Spirit, the word of faith, and to Chri&s;t in their hearts, the hope of glory. Chri&s;t told the &s;aints, that the Spirit of truth, the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;hould be their leader into all truth; and Jude exhorts the church to <Q>pray in the Ho|ly Gho&s;t,</Q> and <Q>to be built up in their mo&s;t holy faith, which Chri&s;t was the author of.</Q> Chri&s;t, by his &s;ervant <Q>John, exhorted the &s;even churches to hear what the Spirit &s;aid to the churches;</Q> and this was an inward &s;piritual hearing. Chri&s;t &s;ays, the inwardly ravening wolves &s;hould have the &s;heeps cloathing. Paul &s;peaks of &s;ome in his time that had a form of godline&s;s, but denied the power. John &s;aid, "They went out from us." Jude &s;aid, <Q>They go in Cain's way, and in Balaam's and Corah's way.</Q> By all which it may be clearly &s;een, that the fal&s;e prophets and antichri&s;ts, which Chri&s;t foretold &s;hould come, the apo&s;tles &s;aw were come; and in their day the la&s;t time was begun. The&s;e went from them into the world, and the world went after them! The&s;e were the fore-men, the leaders of the world, that brought them into a form of godline&s;s, but inwardly ravened from the power and Spirit! The&s;e have the &s;heeps cloathing, the words of Chri&s;t, of the prophets, and of the apo&s;tles; but are in|wardly ravened from the power and Spirit that they were in who gave forth the &s;criptures. The&s;e have made up the bea&s;t, and the whore! The&s;e have gotten the dragon's power, the murdering, de&s;troying, per&s;ecuting, power! And the&s;e are they that the world wonders after! The&s;e have drunk the blood of the martyrs, prophets, and &s;aints, and per&s;ecuted the true church into the wilderne&s;s! The&s;e have &s;et up the &s;al&s;e, compelling wor&s;hips, and have drunk the blood of the &s;aints, that will not drink of their cup! The&s;e have made the cage for the unclean birds, that have their &s;everal unclean notes in their cage; which cage is made up by the power of darkne&s;s, and unclean gho&s;t: and the birds of the cage deny the Holy Chofl, and the
<PB N="282" REF="037441_0359_100D9043747C1C88">power of God, which the apo&s;tles were in, to be now manife&s;ted in the &s;aints! Thus &s;ince Chri&s;t &s;aid, the fal&s;e prophets and antichri&s;ts &s;hould come, and the apo&s;tle &s;aid. They were come, the bea&s;t's and the dragon's wor|&s;hip hath been &s;et up; the whore is got up with her fal&s;e prophets, her cage hath been made, all nations have drunk of her cup of fornication, the blood of the martyrs and &s;aints they have drunk, and the true church hath fled into the wilderne&s;s. All this &s;ince the apo&s;tles days. Yet the blind deceivers of all &s;orts, the antichri&s;ts and fal&s;e prophets of our age, would make us and people believe that the fal&s;e prophets, antichri&s;ts, and deceivers are come but now; though John and other of the apo&s;tles tell us, they began to come above &s;ixteen hundred years ago. And ye may &s;ee what work and confu&s;ion they have made in the world; how much blood the&s;e Cains have drunk, that went in Cain's way: which blood cries to God for vengeance upon Chri&s;tendom! And how the&s;e Balaams, who have erred from the power of the Spirit which the apo&s;tles were in, have coveted after other men's e&s;tates, the many gaols, courts, and &s;poiling of goods will bear witne&s;s. And how the&s;e Corahs have gain&s;ayed the li&s;e, power, and &s;pirit which the apo&s;tles and true church were in, and the free teaching of Chri&s;t and of his apo&s;tles, and the work of their mini&s;try, which was <Q>to pre&s;ent every man perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</Q> hath been evident.</P>
<P>Therefore in the name and power of the Lord Je&s;us was I &s;ent to preach again the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, which had been preached before unto Abraham, and in the apo&s;tles days; and was to go over all nations, and to be preached to every creature. For as the apo&s;tacy hath gone over all nations &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, &s;o that the nations are be|come as waters, un&s;table, being gone from Chri&s;t, the foundation; &s;o mu&s;t the go&s;pel, the power of God, go over all nations again. We find the fal&s;e prophets, anti|chri&s;ts deceivers, whore, fal&s;e church, bea&s;t, and his wor|&s;hip in the dragon's power, have got up in the times betwixt the apo&s;tles and us. For Chri&s;t &s;aid, <Q>They &s;hould come:</Q> and the apo&s;tles &s;aw, "They were come," and coming in their days; and that they went forth from them, and the world went after them. And now hath the Lord rai&s;ed us up beyond them, and &s;et us over them in the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, the power of God: that as all have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned by the bea&s;ts, whore, fal&s;e prophets, and anti|chri&s;ts,
<PB N="283" REF="037441_0360_100D90456F1FCFF0">&s;o the everla&s;ting go&s;pel may be preached again by us to all nations, and to every creature, which will bring life and immortality to light in them, that they may &s;ee over the devil and his fal&s;e prophets, antichri&s;ts, &s;educers and deceivers, and over the whore and bea&s;t, and to that which was before they were. This me&s;&s;age of the glorious, everla&s;ting go&s;pel was I &s;ent forth to declare and publi&s;h, and thou&s;ands by it are turned to God, having received it; and are come into &s;ubjection to it, and into the holy order of it. And &s;ince I have declared this me&s;&s;age in this part of the world and in America, and have written books of the &s;ame, to &s;pread it univer&s;ally abroad, the blind pro|phets, preachers, and deceivers have given over telling us, the &s;al&s;e prophets &s;hould "come in the la&s;t times;" for a great light is &s;prung up and &s;hines over their heads: &s;o that every child in truth &s;ees the folly of their &s;ayings.</P>
<P>Then they got other objections again&s;t us, and invented &s;hifts to &s;ave them&s;elves from truth's &s;troke. For when we blamed them for taking tithes, which came from the tribe of Levi, and were &s;et up here by the Romi&s;h church, they would plead, <Q>That Chri&s;t told the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, they ought to pay tithes of mint, ani&s;e, and cummin, though they neglected the weightier matters:</Q> and that Chri&s;t &s;aid, <Q>the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees &s;at in Mo&s;es's &s;eat, therefore all that they bid you do, that do and ob&s;erve.</Q> And when we told them they were envious per&s;ecuting prie&s;ts, they would reply, <Q>That &s;ome preached Chri&s;t of envy, and &s;ome of contention, and &s;ome of good-will.</Q> Now the&s;e &s;criptures and others &s;uch-like they would bring to darken the minds of their hearers, and to per&s;uade them and us, <Q>That we ought to do as they &s;ay, though they them&s;elves were like the phari&s;ees; and that we &s;hould re|joice when envious men and men of &s;trife preached Chri&s;t; and that we &s;hould give them the tithes as the Jews did to the tribe of Levi.</Q> The&s;e were fair glo&s;&s;es; here was a great heap of hu&s;ks, but no kernel. Now this was their blindne&s;s; for the Levitical prie&s;thood Chri&s;t hath ended, and di&s;annulled the commandment that gave them tithes, and the law by which tho&s;e prie&s;ts were made. Chri&s;t did not come after that order, neither did he &s;end forth his mi|ni&s;ters after that order: for tho&s;e of that order were to take tithes for their maintenance, but his mini&s;ters he &s;ent forth freely. And as for hearing the phari&s;ees and the Jews pay|ing tithes of mint, ani&s;e, and cummin, that was before
<PB N="284" REF="037441_0361_100D90475E444A80">Chri&s;t was &s;acrificed and offered up; the Jews were then to do the law, and perform their offerings and &s;acrifices which the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts did teach them. But after Chri&s;t was offered up, he bid them then <Q>Go into all nations and preach the go&s;pel; and lo,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I will be with you to the end of the world;</Q> and in another place he &s;aith, "I will be in you." He did not bid them go to hear the phari&s;ees then, and pay tithe of mint, ani&s;e, and cummin then; but <Q>Go, preach the go&s;pel, and believe in the Lord Je&s;us and be &s;aved, and receive the go&s;pel,</Q> which would bring people off from the Jews, the tithes, the Levitical law, and the offerings thereof, to Chri&s;t, the one Offering, made once for all. O what work had the apo&s;tle both with the Galatians and the Romans to bring them off the law to the faith in Chri&s;t!</P>
<P>And as for the apo&s;tle's &s;aving, <Q>Some preached Chri&s;t of envy and &s;trife,</Q> &amp;c. That was at the fir&s;t &s;preading of Chri&s;t's name abroad, when they were in danger not on|ly to be ca&s;t out of the &s;ynagogues, but to be &s;toned to death, that confe&s;&s;ed to the name of Je&s;us; as may be &s;een by the uproars that were among the Jews and Diana's wor&s;hippers at the preaching of Chri&s;t. So the apo&s;tle might well rejoice if the envious, and men of &s;trife and contention did preach Chri&s;t at that time; though they thought thereby to add affliction to his bonds. But af|terward, when Chri&s;t's name was &s;pread abroad, and ma|ny had got a form of godline&s;s, but denied the power thereof, <Q>Envious, proud, contentious men, men of &s;trife, covetous men, teachers for filthy lucre,</Q> the apo&s;tle com|manded the &s;aints to turn from, and not to have any fel|low&s;hip with them. And the deacons and mini&s;ters were fir&s;t to be proved, to &s;ee if they were in the power of godline&s;s, and the Holy Gho&s;t made them over&s;eers and preachers. So it may be &s;een how the prie&s;ts have abu&s;|ed the&s;e &s;criptures for their own ends, and have wre&s;ted them to their own de&s;truction, to ju&s;tify envious, conten|tions men, and men of &s;trife. Whereas the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "The man of God mu&s;t be patient, and apt to teach;" and they were to follow Chri&s;t, as they had them for their examples. The apo&s;tle indeed was very tender to people, while he &s;aw them walk in &s;implicity, as in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e that were &s;crupulous about meats and days; but when the apo&s;tle &s;aw, that &s;ome drew them into the ob&s;ervation of days, and to &s;ettle in &s;uch things, he then
<PB N="285" REF="037441_0362_100D9049A1445B80">reproves them &s;harply, and a&s;ks them, <Q>Who had be|witched them?</Q> So in the ca&s;e of marrying he was ten|der, le&s;t their minds &s;hould be drawn from the Lord's joining; but when they came to forbid marriage, and to &s;et up rules for meats and drinks, he called it a <Q>doctrine of devils,</Q> and an "erring from the true faith." So al&s;o he was tender concerning circumci&s;ion, and in tenderne&s;s &s;uffered &s;ome to be circumci&s;ed; but when he &s;aw they went to make a &s;ect of it, and to &s;et up circumci&s;ion as a &s;tanding practice, he told them plainly, <Q>If they were circumci&s;ed, Chri&s;t would profit them nothing.</Q> In like manner he was tender concerning the baptizing with water; but when he &s;aw they began to make &s;ects about it, &s;ome crying up Paul, others Apollos, he judged them, and called them carnal, and thanks God he had baptized no more but &s;uch and &s;uch; declaring plainly, that he was &s;ent to preach the go&s;pel, and not to baptize; and brought them to the one bapti&s;m by the one &s;pirit, into the one body which Chri&s;t, the &s;piritual man, is the head of; and exhorted the church, <Q>all to drink into that one Spirit.</Q> For he a&s;&s;erted in the church the one &s;aith, which Chri&s;t was the author of; and one bapti&s;m, which was that of the Spirit into the one body; and one Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who was the &s;piritual baptizer, who John &s;aid &s;hould come after him. And further the apo&s;ile de|clared, that they, who wor&s;hipped and &s;erved God in the Spirit, were of the circumci&s;ion of the Spirit, which was "not made with hands;" by which the <Q>body of the &s;ins of the fle&s;h was put off:</Q> which circumci&s;ion Chri&s;t is the mini&s;ter of.</P>
<P>Another great objection they had, <Q>That the Quakers denied the &s;acrament,</Q> as they called it, <Q>of bread and wine, which</Q> they &s;aid, <Q>they were to take, and do in re|membrance of Chri&s;t to the end of the world.</Q> A great deal of work we had with the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors about this, and about the &s;everal modes of receiving it in Chri&s;t-endom, &s;o called: for &s;ome of them take it lanceling, &s;ome &s;itting; but none of them all, that ever I could &s;ind, take it as the di&s;ciples took it. For they took it in a chamber after &s;upper; but the&s;e generally take it before dinner and &s;ome &s;ay, after the prie&s;t hath ble&s;&s;ed it, it is <Q>Chri&s;t body.</Q> But as to the matter, Chri&s;t &s;aid, <Q>Do this in remembrance of me.</Q> He did not tell them how oft they &s;hould do it, or how long; neither did he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o
<PB N="286" REF="037441_0363_100D904B56A35190">do it always as long as they lived, or that all believers in him &s;hould do it to the world's end. The apo&s;tle Paul, who was not converted till after Chri&s;t's death, tells the Corinthians, that he had received of the Lord that which he delivered unto them concerning this matter, and relates Chri&s;t's words concerning the cup thus; "This do ye," as oft as ye drink it, "in remembrance of me:" and him&s;elf adds, <Q>For [as often as] ye do eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do &s;hew the Lord's death till he come.</Q> So according to what the apo&s;tle here delivers, neither Chri&s;t nor he did enjoin people to do this always, but leaves it to their liberty, ["as oft as ye drink it," &amp;c.] The Jews did u&s;e to take a cup, and to break bread and divide it among them in their &s;ea&s;ts; as may be &s;een in the Jewi&s;h Antiquities; &s;o the breaking of bread and drinking of wine were Jewi&s;h rites, which were not to la&s;t always. They did al&s;o baptize with water, which made it not &s;eem a &s;trange thing to them, when John the Bapti&s;t came with his decrea&s;ing mini&s;tration of water-bapti&s;m. But as to the bread and wine, after the di&s;ciples had taken it, &s;ome of them que&s;tioned whether Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t? For &s;ome of them &s;aid, after he was crucified, <Q>We tru&s;ted that it had been he which &s;hould have redeemed I&s;rael,</Q> &amp;c. And though the Corinthians had the bread and wine, and were baptized in water, the apo&s;tle told them they were "reprobates, if Chri&s;t was not in them;" and bid them "examine them&s;elves." And as the apo&s;tle &s;aid, <Q>As oft as ye do cat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do s;hew forth the Lord's death [till he come;]</Q> &s;o Chri&s;t had &s;aid before that he was the "bread of life," which "came down from heaven;" and that <Q>he would come, and dwell in them;</Q> which the apo&s;tles did witne&s;s ful|filled; and exhorted others to &s;eek for that which <Q>comes down from above:</Q> but the outward bread and wine, and water, are not from above but from below. Now ye that eat and drink this outward bread and wine in remem|brance of Chri&s;t's death, and have your fellow&s;hips in that, will ye come no nearer to Chri&s;t's death than to take bread and wine in remembrance of it? After ye have eaten in remembrance of his death, ye mu&s;t come into his death, and die with him, as the apo&s;tles did, if ye will live with him. This is a nearer and further advanced &s;tate, to be with him in the fellow&s;hip of his death, than only to take bread and wine in remembrance of it. You mu&s;t have
<PB N="287" REF="037441_0364_100D904D8A7E5EF0">fellow&s;hip with Chri&s;t in his &s;ufferings; if ye will reign with him, ye mu&s;t &s;uffer with him; if ye will live with him, ye mu&s;t die with him; and if ye die with him, ye mu&s;t be buried with him; and being buried with him in the true bapti&s;m, ye al&s;o ri&s;e with him. Then having &s;uf|fered with him, died with him, and been buried with him, if ye are ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, <Q>&s;eek tho&s;e things which are above, where Chri&s;t &s;itteth on the right hand of God.</Q> Eat the bread which comes down from above, which is not outward bread; and drink the cup of &s;alvation which he gives in his kingdom, which is not outward wine. And then there will not be a looking at the things that are &s;een (as outward bread and wine and water are:) for, as &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <Q>The things that are &s;een are tempo|ral, but the things that are not &s;een are eternal.</Q> So here are many &s;tates and conditions to be gone through before people come to &s;ee that, and partake of that which "cometh down from above." For fir&s;t, There was <Q>a taking of the outward bread and wine in remembrance of Chri&s;t's death.</Q> This was temporary, and not of nece&s;|&s;ity; but at their liberty, "As oft as ye do it," &amp;c. Se|condly, There mu&s;t be <Q>a coming into his death, a &s;uf|fering with Chri&s;t;</Q> and this is of nece&s;&s;ity to &s;alvation; and not temporary, but continual: there mu&s;t be <Q>a dying daily.</Q> Thirdly, "a being buried with Chri&s;t." Fourthly, "a ri&s;ing with Chri&s;t." Fifthly, After they are ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, then <Q>a &s;eeking tho&s;e things which are above, a &s;eeking the bread that comes down from heaven,</Q> and a <Q>feeding on that and having fellow&s;hip in that.</Q> For outward bread, wine, and water are from below, and are vi&s;ible and temporal; but, &s;aith the apo&s;|tle, <Q>We look not at things that are &s;een, for the things that are &s;een are temporal, but the things that are not &s;een are eternal.</Q> So the fellow&s;hip that &s;tands in the u&s;e of bread, wine, water, circumci&s;ion, outward temple, and things &s;een will have an end: but the fellow&s;hip which &s;tands in the go&s;pel, the power of God, which was before the devil was, and which brings life and immortality to light, by which people may &s;ee over the devil that has darkened them, this fellow&s;hip is eternal, and will &s;tand. And all that are in it &s;eek that which is heavenly and eternal, which comes down from above, and are &s;ettled in the eternal my&s;tery of the fellow&s;hip of the go&s;pel, which is hid from all eyes that look only at vi&s;ible things. The apo&s;tle told
<PB N="288" REF="037441_0365_100D90502DC3BA90">the Corinthians, who were in di&s;order about water, bread and wine, that he <Q>de&s;ired to know nothing among&s;t them, but Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified.</Q></P>
<P>Thus were the objections which the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors had rai&s;ed again&s;t friends an&s;wered, and the &s;tumbling-blocks they had laid in the way of the weak removed. And as things were thus opened, people came to &s;ee over them and through them, and to have their minds &s;ettled upon the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their free teacher: which was the &s;ervice for which I was moved to travel over the nation after my impri&s;onment in Lance&s;ton gaol. In this year the Lord's truth was finely planted over the nation, and many thou&s;ands were turned to the Lord; in&s;omuch that there were &s;eldom &s;ewer than one thou&s;and in pri&s;on in this na|tion for truth;s te&s;timony; &s;ome for tithes, &s;ome for going to the &s;teeple-hou&s;es, &s;ome for contempts, as they called them, &s;ome for not &s;wearing, and others for not putting off their hats, &amp;c.</P>
<P>After I had vi&s;ited mo&s;t parts of the nation, and was come to London again, finding that evil &s;pirit at work which had drawn J. N. and his followers out of the truth, to run friends into heats about him, I wrote a &s;hort epi&s;tle to friends, as followeth:</P>

Therefore be wi&s;e in the wi&s;dom of God, which is from above, by which all things were made and created; that that may be ju&s;tified among you, and you all kept in the &s;olid life, which was before death was; and in the light which was before darkne&s;s was with all its works. In which light and life ye all may feel and have heavenly unity and peace, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the go&s;pel-fellow&s;hip that is everla&s;ting; which was before that which doth not la&s;t for ever, and will remain when that is gone. For the go&s;pel being the power of God, is pure and everla&s;ting. Know it to be your portion; in which is &s;tability, life, and immortality, &s;hining over that which darkens the mortal. So be faithful every one to God in your mea|&s;ures of his power and life, that ye may an&s;wer God's love and mercy to you, as obedient children of the Mo&s;t High; dwelling in love, unity, peace, and innocency of heart towards one another; that God may be glorified in you, and you kept faithful witne&s;&s;es for him, and valiant for the truth on earth. God Almighty pre&s;erve you all to his glory, that ye may feel his ble&s;&s;ing among you, and that ye may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors thereof.</P>

<P>About this time many mouths being opened in our meetings to declare the goodne&s;s of the Lord, &s;ome that were young and tender in the truth would &s;ometimes utter a few words in thank&s;giving and prai&s;es to God; that no di&s;order might ari&s;e from thence in our meetings, I was moved to write an epi&s;tle to friends by way of advice in that matter:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL my dear friends in the noble &s;eed of God, who have known his power, life, and pre&s;ence among
<PB N="290" REF="037441_0367_100D9053B9BB7EC8">you, let it be your joy to hear or &s;ee the &s;prings of life break forth in any; through which ye have all unity in the &s;ame, feeling life and power. And above all things take heed of judging any one openly in your meetings, except they be openly prophane or rebellious, &s;uch as are out of the truth; that by the power, life, and wi&s;dom ye may &s;tand over them, and by it an&s;wer the witne&s;s of God in the world, that &s;uch, whom ye bear your te&s;timony again&s;t, are none of you: that therein the truth may &s;tand clear and &s;ingle. But &s;uch as are tender, if they &s;hould be moved to bubble forth a few words, and &s;peak in the &s;eed and Lamb's power, &s;uffer and bear that; that is, the ten|der. And if they &s;hould go beyond their mea&s;ure, bear it in the meeting for peace and order's &s;ake, and that the &s;pi|rits of the world be not moved again&s;t you. But when the meeting is done, if any be moved to &s;peak to them, be|tween you and them, one or two of you that feel it in the life, do it in the love and wi&s;dom that is pure and gentle from above, for love is that which edifies, bears all things, &s;uffers long, and fulfils the law. In this ye have order and edification, ye have wi&s;dom to pre&s;erve you all wi&s;e and in patience; which takes away the occa&s;ion of &s;tumb|ling the weak, and the occa&s;ion of the &s;pirits of the world to get up: but in the royal feed, the heavy &s;tone, ye keep down all that is wrong, and by it an&s;wer that of God in all. For ye will hear, &s;ee, and feel the power of God preach|ing, as your faith is wholly in it (when ye do not hear words) to bind, to chain, to limit, to fru&s;trate, that no|thing &s;hall ri&s;e nor come forth but what is in the power; with that ye will hold back, with that ye will let up and open every &s;pring, plant, and &s;park; in which will be your joy and refre&s;hment in the power of God. Ye that know the power of God and are come to it, which is the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, that crucifies you to the &s;tate that Adam and Eve were in in the fall, and &s;o to the world, by this power of God ye come to &s;ee the &s;tate that Adam and Eve were in before they fell: which power of God is the cro&s;s, in which &s;tands the everla&s;ting glory, which brings up into righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s, the image of God, and cruci|fies to unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and unholine&s;s, the image of &s;atan, that Adam and Eve and their &s;ons and daughters are in under the fall. Through this power of God ye come to &s;ee the &s;tate they were in before they fell; yea, and I &s;ay, to an higher &s;tate, to the Seed Chri&s;t, the Second Adam,
<PB N="291" REF="037441_0368_100D90558FF2CB50">by whom all things were made. For man hath been driv|en from God. All Adam and Eve's &s;ons and daughters, being in the &s;tate of the fall in the earth, are driven from God. But it is &s;aid. "The church is in God, the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t:" &s;o who come to the church, which is in God the Father of Chri&s;t, they mu&s;t come to God again, out of the &s;tate that Adam and his children are in in the &s;all, out of the image of God, out of righteou&s;|ne&s;s and holine&s;s; and they mu&s;t come into the righteou&s;|ne&s;s, into the true holine&s;s, the image of God, and out of the earth whither man hath been driven, when they come to the church which is in God. The way to this is Chri&s;t, the Light, the Life, the Truth, the Saviour, the Redeemer, the Sanctifier, and the Ju&s;tifier, in and through who&s;e power, light, and life, conver&s;ion, regeneration, and tran&s;lation is known from death to life, from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan to God again. The&s;e are members of the true church, who know the work of re|generation in the operation and feeling of it; and being come to be members of the church of God, they are indeed members one of another in the power of God, which was before the power of darkne&s;s was. So they that come to the church that is in God and Chri&s;t, mu&s;t come out of the &s;tate that Adam was in in the fall, driven from God, to know the &s;tate that he was in before he fell. But they that live in the &s;tate that Adam was in in the fall, and can|not believe a po&s;&s;ibility of coming into the &s;tate he was in before he fell, come not to the church which is in God; but are far from that, are not pa&s;&s;ed from death to life, but are onemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, which is the power of God. For they mind earthly things, and &s;erve not Chri&s;t; nor love the power which &s;hould bring them up to the &s;tate that Adam was in before he fell, and crucify them to the &s;tate that man is in in the fall; that through this pow|er they might &s;ee to the beginning, the power that man was in before the heavenly image, holine&s;s and righteou&s;|ne&s;s was lo&s;t: by which power they might come to know the Seed. Chri&s;t, which brings out of the old things, and makes all things new; in which life eternal is felt. For all the poorne&s;s, emptine&s;s, and barrenne&s;s is in the &s;tate that man is in in the fall, out of God's power; by which power he is made rich again, and in winch power he hath &s;trength again: which power is the cro&s;s, in which the my|&s;tery of the fellow&s;hip &s;tands; and in which is the true glo|rying,
<PB N="292" REF="037441_0369_100D90584250F0F8">which crucifies to all other glorings. And friends, though ye may have been convinced, and have ta&s;ted of the power, and felt the light, yet afterwards ye may feel a winter-&s;torm, tempe&s;t and hail, fro&s;t and cold, and tempt|ation in the wilderne&s;s. Be patient and &s;till in the power and in the light that doth convince you, to keep your minds to God; in that be quiet, that ye may come to the &s;ummer; that your flight be not in the winter. For if ye &s;it &s;till in the patience which overcomes in the power of God, there will be no flying. The hu&s;bandman, after he hath &s;own his &s;eed, is patient. And ye by the power be|ing kept in the patience, will come by the light to &s;ee through and feel over winter-&s;torms and tempe&s;ts, and all the coldne&s;s, barrenne&s;s, and emptine&s;s: and the &s;ame light and power will go over the tempter's head; which power and light was before he was. So in the light &s;tand|ing &s;till, ye will &s;ee your &s;alvation, ye will &s;ee the Lord's &s;trength, ye will feel the &s;mall rain, ye will feel the fre&s;h &s;prings, your minds being kept low in the power and light: for that which is out of the power lifts up. But in the power and light ye will feel God, revealing his &s;ecrets, in&s;piring your minds, and his gifts coming in unto you; through which your hearts will be filled with God's love, and prai&s;es to him that lives for evermore; for in his light and power his ble&s;&s;ing is received. So in that, the eternal power of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t pre&s;erve and keep you! Live every one in the power of God, that ye may all come to be heirs of that, and know that to be your portion; even the kingdom that hath no end, and the endle&s;s life which the Seed is heir of. Feel that &s;et over all, which hath the promi&s;e, and ble&s;&s;ing of God for ever.</P>

<P>About this time I received &s;ome lines from a high-flown profe&s;&s;or concerning the way of Chri&s;t; to which I return|ed the following an&s;wer:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not oncum&s;tances we contend about; but the way of Chri&s;t and his light, which are but one; though the world hath imagined many ways, and all out of the light which by the light are condemned. He who preach|ed this light, &s;aid, <Q>He that knoweth God, heareth us;
<PB N="293" REF="037441_0370_100D7F5CC216F150">he that is not of God, heareth us not: hereby know we the Spirit of truth, and the &s;pirit of error.</Q> It is the &s;ame now with them that know the truth; though the whole world lies in wickedne&s;s. All di&s;pen&s;ations and differences that are not one in the light we deny; and by the light, that was before &s;eparation, do we &s;ee them to be &s;elf-&s;eparations in the &s;en&s;ual, having not the Spirit. Their fruits and end are weighed in the even balance, and found to be in the dark, the Lo-here. and Lo-there thou telle&s;t of; and the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t is not with them, though the blind &s;ee it not; who &s;ee not with the pure eye, which is &s;ingle; but with the many eyes, which lead into the many ways. Nor are any the people of God, 'but who are baptized into this principle of light: which all the faithful &s;ervants of the Lord were ever guided by in all ages, &s;ince the apo&s;tacy and before. For the apo|&s;tacy was and is from the light; and all that oppo&s;e the light are apo&s;tates. Who conte&s;t again&s;t the truth, are enemies to it, and are not actuated by the Spirit; but have another way than the light. All &s;uch are in the world, its words, fa&s;hions, and cu&s;toms, though of &s;eve|ral forms, as to their wor&s;hip; yet all under the god of this world, oppo&s;ing the light and appearance of Chri&s;t, which &s;hould lead out from under his power, of what form &s;oever they are; yet are they all joined again&s;t the light. All the&s;e are of the world; and fighting again&s;t them who are not of the world; but are gathered and gathering out of the world: &s;o it ever was again&s;t the people of God, under what name &s;oever. They only are &s;aints by calling, who are called into the light; and &s;ons of Sion, which vary not from the light, to which the Spirit is promi&s;ed, which is not tied to any forms out of the light; wherein all inherit, who are co-heirs with Chri&s;t; which many talk of who inherit the earthly, in&s;tead of the heavenly. And whereas thou &s;peake&s;t of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles cloath|ing them&s;elves with the &s;ayings and words of the prophets; and of their being your example in &s;o doing; I &s;ay, wolves will take the &s;heeps cloathing; but the light and life finds them out, and judges (not by their &s;tolen words, but) by their works. Nor did Chri&s;t cover him&s;elf with any words, but what were fulfilled in him: neither do any of Chri&s;t's boa&s;t in other men's lines made ready without them; to which rule if ye be obedient, fewer words and more life will be &s;een among you. Then ye will not
<PB N="294" REF="037441_0371_100D905C0F80CFA0">count in &s;traitne&s;s to &s;ilence the fle&s;h; and hear what he &s;aith, who &s;peaks peace, <Q>that his people turn no more to folly.</Q> If ye once know, that what is &s;tolen mu&s;t be re&s;tored fourfold; the mouth of the fal&s;e prophet will be &s;topped, which builds up in deceit, but, not in righteou&s;|ne&s;s. And whereas thou &s;aye&s;t, <Q>The Spirit of truth affords nothing but endle&s;s varieties;</Q> I &s;ay, the Spirit of truth thou knowe&s;t not: for the Spirit of truth &s;aid, "There is but one thing needful;" and to &s;peak the &s;ame thing again is &s;afe for the hearers; but that &s;pirit which affords nothing but endle&s;s varieties, is not the Spirit of truth, but is gone out into curious notions; and the num|ber of his names and colours is read no-where but in the unity of the Spirit of truth. All others call truth deceit, and deceit truth, as the blind that oppo&s;ed the light ever did, who are ever learning endle&s;s varieties, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, nor to an end of their labours: but when they are out of one form get into ano|ther, &s;o long as they can find a green tree without. Thus ye are kept at work all your life, and to the grave in for|row, as the dumb prie&s;ts, thou telle&s;t of, have been before you; only ye have got a finer image, but le&s;s life. And thou, who&s;e teaching hath no' end, art in the hor&s;e-mill thou &s;peake&s;t of. I have read the epi&s;tles to Timothy, and to the Hebrews; and there I find, the duty of all believers is to &s;ee the law of the new covenant written in the heart, whereby all may know God, from the lea&s;t to-the greate&s;t. I know the holy &s;criptures are profitable for the man of God; but what is that to the man of &s;in, to the fir&s;t-born, who is out of the light, and being un&s;table and unlearned, wre&s;t them to their own de&s;truction; but to the life cannot come? And for your two ordinances thou &s;peakell of, I &s;ay, upon the &s;ame account ye deny the prie&s;ts of the world therein, we deny you; being both of you not-only out of the life, but out of the form too. That command, Matt. xxviii. 19. ye never had, nor its pow|er; which was, <Q>To baptize into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> What Paul received of the Lord, that body and that bread, ye know as little of, but what ye have found in the chapter; nor of the coming of Chri&s;t neither, who cannot believe his light. And where|as thou &s;peake&s;t of preaching Chri&s;t of envy, and pleade&s;t for it; I &s;ay, &s;uch preachers we have enough of in the&s;e days. What el&s;e art thou doing, who &s;aye&s;t, Paul was
<PB N="295" REF="037441_0372_100D7F5E449AD540">&s;ent to baptize; though Paul &s;ays, he was not: &s;o thou woulde&s;t prove him a liar, if any would believe thee before him. Thou &s;aye&s;t al&s;o, <Q>For aught thou knowe&s;t, he might baptize thou&s;ands.</Q> Thou mighte&s;t as ea&s;ily have &s;aid millions, and as &s;oon have proved it. Thou maye&s;t &s;ay the &s;ame of circumci&s;ion al&s;o, and on the &s;ame ground. As for the &s;igns that followed tho&s;e that believed. which thou &s;aye&s;t are cea&s;ed; I &s;ay, they who cannot re|ceive the light cannot &s;ee the &s;igns, nor could believe them, if they &s;hould &s;ee them to carp at; no more than &s;ormerly they could do, who oppo&s;ed the light in former ages. They cannot properly be &s;aid to cea&s;e to &s;uch, who never had them; but have only heard or read that others long ago had them. But that the power, and &s;igns, and pre|&s;ence of God is not the &s;ame that ever it was, in the mea|&s;ure wherein he is received in the light, that I deny; and declare it to be fal&s;e, and from a &s;pirit that knows not God, nor his power. And as for the go&s;pel-foundation thou &s;peake&s;t of, I &s;ay, it is to be laid again in all the world. Ye never were on it, &s;ince the man of &s;in &s;et up his forms without power. Till ye can own the light of Chri&s;t, which the &s;aints preached, and their life and practice; for &s;hame, cea&s;e to talk of their foundation, or glorious work, or quakings and tremblings, the faints experiences, which the world knows not, nor can own: though ye cannot read that ever any came aright to declare how they knew God, or received his word, without them. In thy exhortation thou bidde&s;t me, "Love Chri&s;t, wherefoever I &s;ee him." But had&s;t thou told me where one might come to &s;ee him, or how one might know him, thou had&s;t &s;hewn more of a chri&s;tian in that than in all thou ha&s;t &s;poken. But it &s;eems, ye are not all of one mind. Some of you &s;ay, "He is gone, and will be no more &s;een till doom&s;day." But if ever ye come to &s;ee Chri&s;t to your comfort, while ye oppo&s;e his light, then God hath not &s;poken by me. This thou &s;halt remember, when thy time thou ha&s;t &s;pent.</P>

<P>Great oppo&s;ition did the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors make about this time again&s;t the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, denying it to be univer&s;ally given; and again&s;t the pouring forth of the Spirit, and &s;ons and daughters prophe&s;ying thereby.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>TO you profe&s;&s;ors, prie&s;ts, and teachers, who are in darkne&s;s, and know not the Spirit in pri&s;on, nor the light that &s;hines in darkne&s;s, which the darkne&s;s doth not comprehend; but are as infidels, whom the god of the world hath blinded, and to whom the go&s;pel is hid. For though ye have the four books, the go&s;pel is hid to you; who are now &s;tranging at the work of God, and do not believe that Chri&s;t hath enlightened every one that cometh into the world. To you I offer &s;ome &s;criptures to read, which will prove your &s;pirits, and try them, how contrary they are to the apo&s;tles &s;pirit, the Spirit of Chri&s;t and of the &s;aints. <Q>Chri&s;t went, and preached to the &s;pirits in pri&s;on,</Q> 1 Pet. iii. 19. He that readeth, let him under|&s;tand whether this was a mea&s;ure of the Spirit, yea or nay, or the Spirit without mea&s;ure, which he mini&s;tered to? <Q>For he whom God hath &s;ent, &s;peaketh the words of God; for God giveth not the Spirit by mea&s;ure unto him,</Q> Joh. iii. 34. Here Chri&s;t had not the Spirit given unto him by mea&s;ure. The apo&s;tle &s;aid, <Q>We will not boa&s;t of things without (or beyond) our mea&s;ure,</Q> 2 Cor. x. 13. So here was mea&s;ure, and not by mea&s;ure. Chri&s;t, who received not the Spirit by mea&s;ure, told his di&s;ciples he would <Q>&s;end them the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, that he &s;hould guide them into all truth: for the &s;hould not &s;peak of him&s;elf, but what&s;oever he &s;hall hear, that &s;hall he &s;peak, and he will &s;hew you things to come. He &s;hall glorify me: for he &s;hall receive of mine, and &s;hew it unto you,</Q> Joh. xvi. 13, 14. Mind, read, and learn; the Comforter &s;hall receive of mine, &s;aith Chri&s;t, and &s;hall &s;hew it unto you: who hath the mea&s;ure, re|ceives of his who hath not by mea&s;ure. The Comforter, when he comes, is to reprove the world of &s;in, of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and of judgment, ver. 8. Now mind the great work of God: the Spirit of truth, which leads the &s;aints into all truth, which receives of Chri&s;t's, and &s;hews it unto the di&s;ciples, who are in the mea&s;ure, he &s;hall reprove the world of &s;in, becau&s;e they do not believe, &amp;c. The Comforter, whom Chri&s;t will &s;end, takes of his, and &s;hews it to the di&s;ciples, the &s;ame reproves the world. Mind
<PB N="297" REF="037441_0374_100D90604972CED8">now, whether this be a mea&s;ure, yea or nay, which comes from him who received not the Spirit by mea&s;ure? He that leads the believer into all truth, reproves the unbe|liever in the world, of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of judg|ment. He that is led into all truth, &s;ees that which is re|proved, by the Spirit of truth that leads him. Chri&s;t &s;aith, "He &s;hall take of mine, and &s;hew it unto you." Is 'this a mea&s;ure, yea or nay, from him whom God gave the Spirit not by mea&s;ure unto?</P>
<P>Again the Lord &s;aid, both by his prophet, Joel ii. 28, and his apo&s;tle, Acts ii. 17, 18. <Q>It &s;hall come to pa&s;s in the la&s;t days, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all fle&s;h, your &s;ons and your daughters &s;hall prophe&s;y, your young men &s;hall &s;ee vi&s;ions, and your old men &s;hall dream dreams: and on my &s;ervants and on my hand|maidens I will pour out in tho&s;e days of my Spirit, and they &s;hall prophe&s;y.</Q> Look, ye deceivers; here the Lord &s;aith, he will pour of his Spirit: mark the word OF the Lord's Spirit upon all fle&s;h. What! young men, old men, &s;ons and daughters, and maids, all the&s;e to have the Spirit of God poured upon them? Here, &s;ay they, the&s;e deny the means then. Nay, that's the means. And the great and notable day of the Lord is coming, wherein it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that who&s;oever &s;hall call on the name of the Lord &s;hall be &s;aved. The God of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h is known: and, &s;aith the apo&s;tle, who would not boa&s;t of things beyond his mea&s;ure, <Q>That which may be known of God, is manife&s;t in them; for God hath &s;hewed it unto them,</Q> Rom. i. 19. By this which was of God manife&s;t in them, they knew covetou&s;ne&s;s, malice, murder, deceit, and ungodline&s;s; knew that the judgments of God were upon &s;uch things; and that they were worthy of death; not only that did the &s;ame, but who had plea&s;ure in them that did them. Therefore, &s;aid the abo&s;tle, <Q>the wrath of God is revealed from heaven again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men,</Q> &amp;c. Now this of God manife&s;t in them, which God &s;hewed unto them, by which they know unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and God's judg|ments thereupon, and that they which commit &s;uch things are worthy of death; whether this be a mea&s;ure, yea or nay, which is of God, and which he hath &s;hewed to them? What was that in them, that <Q>did by nature the things con|tained in the law, which &s;hewed the work of the law written in their hearts,</Q> Rom. ii. 14, 15. Mark, "writ|ten:"
<PB N="298" REF="037441_0375_100D906255209D78">&s;hall not this judge them that have the outward law, but are out of the life of it? The apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>The manife&s;tation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal,</Q> 1 Cor. xii. 7. There are diver&s;ities of gifts, but the &s;ame Spirit; the manife&s;tation of it is given to <Q>every man</Q> to profit withal. Mark, <Q>To one is given by the Spirit, the word of wi&s;dom; to another the word of know|ledge by the &s;ame Spirit: to another faith by the &s;ame Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the &s;ame Spirit: to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another di&s;cerning of &s;pirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: but all the&s;e worketh that one and the &s;elf-&s;ame Spirit, di|viding to every man &s;everally as he will.</Q> Mark that, To every man &s;everally as he will.</P>
<P>Again the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>The grace of God, that bringeth &s;alvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world,</Q> Tit. ii. 11, 12. Now ye that turn from this grace, which brings &s;alvation, into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, ye deny it, and &s;ay, that which teacheth the &s;aints, who by grace are &s;aved, hath not appeared to all men. Jude &s;aith, <Q>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thou&s;ands of his &s;aints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard &s;peeches, which ungodly &s;inners have &s;poken again&s;t him,</Q> ver. 15. Here mark again; him that cometh with ten thou&s;ands of his &s;aints, to convince all of their ungodly deeds and hard &s;peeches: here it is, ALL of their ungodly deeds; and ALL of their hard &s;peeches; none left out, but ALL to be con|vinced and judged, the world reproved, by him who comes with ten thou&s;ands of his &s;aints, and will reign, and be king and judge. And have not ye all &s;omething in you, that doth reprove you for your hard &s;peeches, and your ungodly deeds, the ungodlie&s;t of you all, who live in your hard &s;peeches again&s;t him, and again&s;t his light and &s;pi|ritual appearance in his people.</P>
<P>Again, the apo&s;tle, writing to the Gentiles, &s;aith, <Q>But unto every one of us is given grace, according to the mea|&s;ure of the gift of Chri&s;t,</Q> Ephe&s;. iv. 7. Now mark, Here is the mea&s;ure of the gift of Chri&s;t. <Q>who lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</Q> Joh. i. 9. <Q>that
<PB N="299" REF="037441_0376_100D9063E6CDAB88">all men through him might believe. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned, &amp;c. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,</Q> &amp;c. Joh. iii. 18, 19. Now every man that cometh into the world being enlightened, one loveth it, and brings his deeds to the light, that with the light he may &s;ee whether they be wrought in God: the other hates the light, "becau&s;e his deeds are evil;" he will not bring his deeds to the light, becau&s;e he knows the light will reprove him. So he that hates the light, wherewith Chri&s;t hath enlightened him, knows the light will reprove him for his evil deeds; and therefore he will not come to the light.</P>
<P>Again, the Lord by his prophet &s;aith concerning Chri&s;t, <Q>I will give him for a light to the Gentiles, that he may be my &s;alvation to the ends of the earth,</Q> I&s;a. xlix. 6. And what is that which the children, that walk according to the cour&s;e of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the <Q>&s;pirit that now worketh in the children of di&s;obedience,</Q> Ephe&s;. ii. 2. are di&s;obedient to? Mark, and read your&s;elves, who, being di&s;obedient, walk according to the cour&s;e of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air; Mark, I &s;ay, what it is that all &s;uch are di&s;obedient to? He that hath an ear, let him hear. The apo&s;tle &s;aith to the Colo&s;&s;ians, <Q>The wrath of God cometh upon the children of di&s;obedience,</Q> Col. iii. 6. Come, ye profe&s;&s;ors, let us &s;ee, Is not this &s;omething of God that is di&s;obeyed? Is it not that which is of God manife&s;t in them, which God hath &s;hewed them, which lets them &s;ee God's judgments are upon &s;uch, when they act unrighteou&s;ly? Is not this the mea&s;ure of God, the Spirit that is in pri&s;on? and the Spirit of God that is grieved?</P>
<P>And ye profe&s;&s;ors, come, let us read the parable of the talents, and reckon with you, and &s;ee who it is that hath hid the Lord's money in the earth? Come, ye that have gained, enter ye into your ma&s;ter's joy. Go, thou that ha&s;t hid the Lord's money in the earth, into utter dark|ne&s;s; "take if from him, and give it to him that hath:" every man &s;hall have his reward. For the Lord hath given to "every man according to his &s;everal ability," Mat. xxv. 15. Mark that, <Q>To every man according to his &s;everal ability:</Q> Read this, if you can. Now is the Lord coming to call every man &s;everally to account, to
<PB N="300" REF="037441_0377_100D9066A4671398">'whom he hath given &s;everally, according to their ability. Now the wicked and &s;lothful &s;ervant, who hid the Lord's money in the earth, will be found out; and the Lord's money will be taken from him, although he hath hidden it. To him the Lord's commands have been grievous; but to us they are not, who love God and keep his com|mandments. "And," &s;aith the apo&s;tle to the Romans, <Q>I &s;ay, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of him&s;elf more highly than he ought to think: but to think &s;oberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the mea&s;ure of faith,</Q> Rom. xii. 3. Read and mark, here is a mea&s;ure of faith.</P>
<P>"And." &s;aith another apo&s;tle, <Q>as every man hath re|ceived the gift, even &s;o mini&s;ter the &s;ame one to another, as &s;tewards of the manifold grace of God,</Q> 1 Pet. iv. 10. "For the grace of God hath appeared to all men." the good &s;tewards can give their account with joy: but ye bad &s;tewards, that turn from the grace of God into la&s;civiou&s;|ne&s;s, ye will be reckoned withal; ye &s;hall have your re|ward. "But," &s;ay the world, <Q>mu&s;t every one mini&s;ter as he hath received the gift?</Q> Yea, &s;ay I, <Q>but let him &s;peak as the oracles of God; and let him do it as of the ability which God giveth,</Q> ver. 11. John in the Reve|lation &s;aith, <Q>They were judged every man according to their works,</Q> Rev. xx. 13. Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>Every idle word that men &s;hall &s;peak, they &s;hall give account thereof in the day of judgment,</Q> Mat. xii. 36. <Q>Ye that name the name of Chri&s;t, depart from iniquity,</Q> 2 Tim. ii. 19. <Q>The Son of Man &s;hall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then he &s;hall reward every man ac|cording to his works.</Q> Mat. xvi. He who is gone into a far country, and hath given talents to every one of you, ac|cording to your &s;everal ability, <Q>will render to every man according to his deeds,</Q> Rom. ii. 6. <Q>And further I &s;ay unto you, if any man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his. And if Chri&s;t be in you, the body is dead becau&s;e of &s;in; but the Spirit is life, becau&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q> Rom. viii. 9, 10. So let the light, which cometh from Chri&s;t, examine; for the Lord is appearing. Ye that have recoved according to your ability, &s;mite not your fellow-&s;ervant. Think not that the Lord delayeth the time of his coming. Be not as they that &s;aid, <Q>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we &s;hall die.</Q></P>
<P>The apo&s;tle tells the Ephe&s;ians, that unto him <Q>this
<PB N="301" REF="037441_0378_100D906954F1A9F0">grace was given&mdash;to make all men &s;ee what is the fellow|&s;hip of the my&s;tery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q> Eph. iii. 9. Read and under&s;tand every one with the light which comes from Chri&s;t, the my&s;tery; which will be your condemnation, if ye believe not in it. This is to all who &s;tumble at the work of the Spirit of God, the manife&s;tation of it, <Q>which is given to every man to profit withal.</Q> Come, ye profe&s;&s;ors, who &s;tumble at it; let us read the parables. <Q>A &s;ower went forth to &s;ow; and &s;ome &s;eed fell on the highway-ground, and &s;ome on &s;tony ground, and &s;ome on thorny ground: the &s;eed is the Word, the Son of Man is the &s;eed&s;man. He that hath an ear, let him hear,</Q> Mat. xiii. Now look, all ye profe&s;&s;ors, what ground ye are? And what ye have brought forth? And whether the wicked &s;eed&s;man hath not got his &s;eed into your ground? <Q>He that hath an ear, let him hear it.</Q> And come, read another parable of the hou&s;eholder hiring labourers to go into the vine|yard, and agreeing with every man for a penny, Mat. xx. Every man is to have his penny; the la&s;t that went in, as well as the fir&s;t; <Q>and the la&s;t &s;hall be fir&s;t, and the fir&s;t &s;hall be la&s;t; for many are called, but few are cho|&s;en. He that hath an ear, let him hear.</Q> There was a query put to Cain. <Q>If thou do&s;t well, &s;halt thou not be accepted?</Q> Gen. iv. 7. And E&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u had a birth|right, 'but de&s;pi&s;ed it. Yet it is not "of him that wil|leth," Rom. ix. 16. but by grace ye are &s;aved," Ephe&s;. ii. 8.

And ye that are children of light, put on the ar|mour of light, that ye may come into the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God; unto a <Q>per|fect man, unto the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t: that henceforth ye be no more children to&s;&s;ed to and fro,</Q> Eph. iv. 13.</P>
<P>The Lord &s;aid, he would make a new covenant, by <Q>writing his law in people's hearts, and putting his Spirit in their inward parts,</Q> whereby they &s;hould all come to know the Lord, by whom the world was made. Now every one of you mind the law written in your hearts, and this Spirit put in your inward parts, that it need not be &s;aid to you, "Know the Lord:" but that ye may wit|ne&s;s the promi&s;e of God fulfilled in you. But, &s;ay the world and profe&s;&s;ors, "If every one mu&s;t come to witne&s;s
<PB N="302" REF="037441_0379_100D9113BA4F3B18">the law of God written in their hearts, and the Spirit put in the inward parts, "what mu&s;t we do with all our teachers?" As we come to witne&s;s that, we need not any man to teach us to know the Lord, having his law written in our hearts, and his Spirit put in our inward parts. This is the covenant of life, the everla&s;ting covenant, which decays not, nor changes not: and here is the way to the Father, without which no man cometh unto the Father. Here is the ever|la&s;ting prie&s;thood, the end of the old prie&s;thood, who&s;e lips were to pre&s;erve knowledge; but now, &s;aith Chri&s;t, "Learn of me:" who is the high-prie&s;t, of the new prie&s;t|hood. And, &s;aith the apo&s;tle,&mdash; <Q>That ye may grow up in the knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in whom are hid the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge.</Q> So we are brought off from the old prie&s;thood that did change, to Chri&s;t, to the new prie&s;thood that doth not change; off from the fir&s;t covenant that doth decay, to the everla&s;ting covenant that doth not decay, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Covenant of Light, from whom every one of you have a light, that ye might believe in the Covenant of Light. If ye do not believe, ye are condemned; for light is come into the world, and men love darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds are evil. "I am come a light into the world," &s;aith Chri&s;t, <Q>that who&s;oever believeth in me &s;hould not abide in darkne&s;s, but have the light of life,</Q> John xii. 46. "Believe in the light, that ye may be children of the light" Ye who do not believe in the light, but hate it becau&s;e it manife&s;ts your deeds to be evil, ye are condemned by the light. Therefore while ye have time, prize it. Seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is nigh; le&s;t ye &s;ay, "Time is pa&s;t:" for the rich glut|ton's time was pa&s;t. Therefore, while time is not quite pa&s;t, con&s;ider, &s;earch your&s;elves, and &s;ee if you be not they that hate the light, and &s;o are builders that &s;tumble at the corner-&s;tone; for they that hated the light, and did not believe in the light, did &s;o in ages pa&s;t. <Q>I am the light of the world,</Q> &s;aith Chri&s;t, "who," the apo&s;tle &s;aith, "doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world." Chri&s;t al&s;o &s;aith, "Learn of me;" and of him God &s;aith, "This is my beloved Son, hear ye him." Here is your Teacher. But ye that hate the light do not learn of Chri&s;t, will not have him to be your king to reign over you; him, to whom all power in heaven and earth is giv|en, who bears his government upon his &s;houlders, who is
<PB N="303" REF="037441_0380_100D7F75C470CB88">now come to reign, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world, who will give to every man a reward ac|cording to his works, whether they be good or evil. So every man, with the light that comes from Chri&s;t, will &s;ee his deeds, both he that hates it and he that loves it. And he that will not bring his deeds to the light, becau&s;e the light will reprove him, that is his condemnation; and he &s;hall have a reward according to his deeds. For the Lord is come to reckon with you. He looks for fruits; the ax is laid to your root; and every tree of you, that bears not good fruit, mu&s;t be hewn down and ca&s;t into the fire.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Having &s;taid &s;ome time in London, and vi&s;ited the meet|ings of friends in and about the city, and cleared my&s;elf of what &s;ervices the Lord had at the time laid upon me there, I left the town and travelled into Kent, Su&s;&s;ex, and Sur|ry, vi&s;iting friends; among&s;t whom I had great meetings, and often met with oppo&s;ition from Bapti&s;ts and other jangling profe&s;&s;ors; but the Lord's power went over them.</P>
<P>We lay one night at Farnham, where we had a little meet|ing. The people were exceeding rude; but at la&s;t the Lord's power came over them. After meeting we went to our inn, and gave notice, <Q>That any who feared God might come to our inn to us.</Q> There came abundance of rude people, the magi&s;trates of the town, and &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors. I declared the truth to them; and tho&s;e of the people that be|haved them&s;elves rudely, the magi&s;trates put out of the room. When they were gone, another rude company of profe&s;&s;ors came up, and &s;ome of the chief of the town. They called for faggots and drink, though we forbad them, and were as rude a people as ever I met withal. The Lord's power chained them, that they had not power to do us any mi&s;chief; but when they went away they left all the faggots and beer, which they had called for into the room, for us to pay for in the morning. We &s;hewed the innkeep|er what an unworthy thing it was; but he told us, <Q>we mu&s;t pay it;</Q> and pay it we did. Before we left the town, I wrote to the magi&s;trates and heads of the town, and to the prie&s;t, &s;hewing them how he had taught his people, and laying before them their rude and uncivil carriage to &s;trangers that &s;ought their good.</P>
<P>Leaving that place we came to Ba&s;ing&s;toke, a very rude town; where they had formerly very much abu&s;ed friends.
<PB N="304" REF="037441_0381_100D7F784C054540">There I had a meeting in the evening, which was quiet; for the Lord's power chained the unruly. At the clo&s;e of the meeting I was moved to put off my hat, and to pray to the Lord to open their under&s;tandings; upon which they rai&s;ed a report, <Q>That I put off my hat to them, and bid them good night,</Q> which was never in my heart. After the meet|ing, when we came to our inn, I &s;ent for the innkeeper, as I u&s;ed to do; and he came into the room to us, and &s;hew|ed him&s;elf a very rude man. I admoni&s;hed him to be &s;o|ber, and fear the Lord; but he called for faggots and a pint of wine, and drank it off him&s;elf; then called for another, and called up half a dozen men into our chamber. Thereup|on I bid him go out of the chamber, and told him he &s;hould not drink there; for we &s;ent for him up to &s;peak to him con|cerning his eternal good. He was exceeding mad, rude, and drunk. When he continued his rudene&s;s and would not be gone, I told him, <Q>The chamber was mine for the time I lodged in it;</Q> and called for the key. Then he went away in a rage. In the morning he would not be &s;een; but I told his wife of his unchri&s;tian carriage towards us.</P>
<P>After this we came to Bridport, having meetings in the way. We went to an inn, and &s;ent into the town for &s;uch as feared God; and there came a &s;hopkeeper, a profe&s;&s;or, and put off his hat to us: and &s;eeing we did not the like to him again, but &s;aid Thou and Thee to him, he told us, 'He was not of our religion;' and after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e he went away. After awhile he &s;ent to the inn to us, to de|&s;ire us 'to come to his hou&s;e, for &s;ome would &s;peak with us.' Thomas Curtis went to his hou&s;e; where when he came, the man had got the prie&s;t and magi&s;trates thither, and they boa&s;ted much that they had catched George Fox, taking him for me. When they perceived their mi&s;take they were very angry; yet the Lord's power came over them, &s;o that they let him go again. Mean while I had an opportunity of &s;peaking to &s;ome &s;ober people that came to the inn. When Thomas was returned, and we were pa&s;&s;ing out of the town, &s;ome came to us, and &s;aid, <Q>The officers were coming to fetch me;</Q> but the Lord's power was over them, &s;o that they had not power to touch me. There were &s;ome con|vinced in the town who were turned to the Lord, and have &s;tood faithful in their te&s;timony to the truth ever &s;ince, and a &s;ine meeting is &s;ettled there.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing from hence we vi&s;ited Port&s;mouth and Pool, where we had glorious meetings; and many were turned to
<PB N="305" REF="037441_0382_100D7F7ADD295CD0">the Lord. At Ringwood we had a large general meeting, where the Lord's power was over all. At Weymouth we had a meeting; and from thence came through Dorche&s;ter to Lime, where the inn we went to was taken up with mountebanks, &s;o that there was hardly any room for us or our hor&s;es. In the evening we drew up &s;ome queries con|cerning the ground of all di&s;ea&s;es, and the nature and virtues of medicinable creatures, and &s;ent them to the mountebanks; l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tting them know, <Q>If they would not an|&s;wer them, we would &s;tick them on the cro&s;s next day.</Q> This brought them down and made them cool, for they could not an&s;wer them; but in the morning they rea&s;oned a little with us. We left the queries with &s;ome friendly people that were convinced in the town, to &s;tick upon the market-cro&s;s. The Lord's power reached &s;ome of the &s;ober people in that place, who were turned by the Light and Spirit of Chri&s;t to his free teaching.</P>
<P>We then travelled to Exeter; and at the Seven Stars, an inn at the bridge foot, we had a general meeting of friends out of Cornwall and Devon&s;hire; to which came Humphry Lower, Thomas Lower, and John Ellis from the Land's|end, Henry Pollexfen, with friends from Plymouth, Eli|zabeth Trelawny, and divers other friends. A ble&s;&s;ed hea|venly meeting we had, and the Lord's everla&s;ting power came over all; in which I &s;aw, and &s;aid, <Q>That the Lord's power had &s;urrounded this nation round about as with a wall and bulwark, and his &s;eed reached from &s;ea to &s;ea.</Q> Friends were e&s;tabli&s;hed in the everla&s;ting feed of life, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, their life, rock, teacher, and &s;hepherd.</P>
<P>The next morning, major Blackmore &s;ent &s;oldiers to ap|prehend me; but I was gone before they came. As I was riding up the &s;treet, I &s;aw the officers going down. So the Lord cro&s;&s;ed their de&s;ign, and friends pa&s;&s;ed away peacea|bly and quietly. The &s;oldiers examined &s;ome friends after I was gone, 'What they did there?' but when they told them, <Q>They were in their inn, and had bu&s;ine&s;s in the city,</Q> they pa&s;&s;ed away without meddling any further with them.</P>
<P>From Exeter I took meetings as I went, till I came to Bri&s;tol; and was at the meeting there. After it was done I did not &s;tay in the town, but pa&s;&s;ed into Wales, and had a meeting at the Slone. Thence going to Cardiff, a ju&s;tice of peace &s;ent to me, de&s;iring, <Q>I would come with half a dozen of my friends to his hou&s;e,</Q> So I took a friend or
<PB N="306" REF="037441_0383_100D7F7C61E45888">two and went to him, and he and his wife received us very civilly. The next day we had a meeting in Cardiff in the town-hall; to which that ju&s;tice &s;ent about &s;eventeen of his family. There came &s;ome di&s;turbers, but the Lord's power was over them; and many were turned to the Lord. To &s;ome who had run out with James Nayler, and for&s;ook meetings, I had to &s;end word, <Q>That the day of their vi&s;it|ation was over;</Q> and they never pro&s;pered after.</P>
<P>We travelled from Cardiff to Swan&s;ea, where we had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting; and a meeting was &s;ettled there in the name of Je&s;us. In our way thither we pa&s;&s;ed over in a pa&s;&s;age-boat with the high &s;heriff of the county. The next day I went to have &s;poken with him, but he refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>We went to another meeting in the country; where the Lord's pre&s;ence was much with us. From thence we went to a great man's hou&s;e, who received us very lovingly; but the next morning he would not be &s;een: one, that in the mean time came to him, had &s;o e&s;tranged him, that we could not get to &s;peak with him again.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed through the countries, having meetings, and gathering people in the name of Chri&s;t, their heavenly teacher, till we came to Brecknock; where we &s;et up our hor&s;es at an inn. There went with me Thomas Holmes, and John-ap-John, who was moved of the Lord to <Q>&s;peak in the &s;treets.</Q> I walked out but a little into the fields; and when I returned the town was in an uproar. When I came into the chamber in the inn, it was full of people, and they were &s;peaking in Welch. I de&s;ired them to &s;peak in Engli&s;h, which they did; and much di&s;cour&s;e we had. After awhile they went away. Towards night the magi&s;|trates gathered in the &s;treets with a multitude of people, and they bid them &s;hout, and gathered up the town; &s;o that, for about two hours together, there was &s;uch a noi&s;e as the like we had not heard; and the magi&s;trates &s;et them on to &s;hout again when they had given over. We thought it looked like the uproar, which we read was among&s;t Diana's craft&s;men. This tumult continued till it was within night, and if the Lord's power had not limited them, they &s;eemed likely to have pulled down the hou&s;e, and us to pieces.</P>
<P>At night the woman of the hou&s;e would have had us go to &s;upper in another room; but we, di&s;cerning her plot, refu&s;ed. Then &s;he would have had half a dozen men come into the room to us, under pretence of di&s;cour&s;ing with us.
<PB N="307" REF="037441_0384_100D7F81F6BF0B90">We told her, <Q>No per&s;on &s;hould come into our room that night, neither would we go to them.</Q> Then &s;he &s;aid, we &s;hould '&s;up in another room;' but we told her, we would have no &s;upper if we had it not in our own room. At length, when &s;he &s;aw &s;he could not get us out, &s;he brought up our &s;upper. So &s;he and they were cro&s;&s;ed in their de|&s;ign; for they had an intent to have done us mi&s;chief, but the Lord prevented them. Next morning I wrote a paper to the town concerning their unchri&s;tian carriage, &s;hewing the fruits of their prie&s;ts and magi&s;trates; and as I pa&s;&s;ed out of town I &s;poke to the people, and told them, They were a &s;hame to Chri&s;tianity and religion.</P>
<P>From this place we went to a great meeting in a &s;teeple-hou&s;e yard; where was a prie&s;t, and Walter Jenkin, who had been a ju&s;tice, and another ju&s;tice. A ble&s;&s;ed glorious meeting we had. There being many profe&s;&s;ors, I was mov|ed of the Lord to open the <Q>&s;criptures to them, and to an&s;wer the objections which they &s;tuck at in their profe&s;|&s;ion (for I knew them very well;) and to turn them to Chri&s;t, who had enlightened them; with which light they might &s;ee the &s;ins and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es they had been dead in, and their Saviour who came to redeem them out of them, who was to be their way to God, the truth and the life to them, and their prie&s;t made higher than the heavens; &s;o that they might come to &s;it under his teaching.</Q> A peace|able meeting we had; many were convinced, and &s;ettled in the truth that day. After the meeting, I went with Walter Jenkin to the other ju&s;tice's, who &s;aid to me, <Q>You have this day given great &s;atisfaction to the people, and an&s;wer|ed all the objections that were in their minds.</Q> For the people had the &s;criptures, but they were not turned to the Spirit, which &s;hould let them &s;ee that which gave them forth, the Spirit of God, which is the key to open them.</P>
<P>From hence we pa&s;&s;ed to Richard Hamborow's at Ponte|moil, where was a great meeting; to which there came an|other ju&s;tice, and &s;everal great people; who&s;e under&s;tand|ings were opened by the Lord's Spirit and power, and they were turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, from whence it came. A great convincement there was; a large meeting is gather|ed in tho&s;e parts, and &s;ettled in the name of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>After this returning to England, we came to Shrew&s;bury, where we had a great meeting; and vi&s;ited friends up and down the country in their meetings, till we came to Wil|liam Gandy's, in Che&s;hire, where we had a meeting of be|tween
<PB N="308" REF="037441_0385_100D7FD6EF9820B8">two and three thou&s;and people, as it was thought; and the everla&s;ting word of life was held forth, and received that day. A ble&s;&s;ed meeting it was; for friends were &s;ettled by the power of God upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the rock and foun|dation.</P>
<P>At this time there was a great drought; and after this general meeting was ended there fell &s;o great a rain, that friends &s;aid, They thought we could not travel, the waters would be &s;o ri&s;en. But I believed the rain had not gone &s;o far as they had come that day to the meeting. The next day in the afternoon, when we turned back into &s;ome parts of Wales again, the ways were du&s;ty, and no rain had fallen thereabouts.</P>
<P>When Oliver Cromwel &s;et forth a proclamation for a fa&s;t throughout the nation for rain, in a very great drought, it was ob&s;erved, that as far as truth had &s;pread in the north, there were plea&s;ant &s;howers and rain enough; yet the &s;outh, in many places, was almo&s;t &s;poiled for want of rain. At that time I was moved to write an an&s;wer to the Pro|tector's proclamation; wherein I told him: <Q>If he had come to own God's truth, he &s;hould have had rain; and that drought was to them a &s;ign of their barrenne&s;s, and want of the water of life.</Q></P>
<P>About the &s;ame time was wrote the following paper to 'di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the true and fal&s;e fa&s;ts.'</P>
<P>Concerning the true Fa&s;ts and the fal&s;e.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>TO all you that are keeping fa&s;ts, who "&s;mite with the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s, and fa&s;t for &s;trife and debate;" again&s;t you hath the voice cried aloud, like a trumpet, that you may come to know the true fa&s;t which is accepted, and the fa&s;t which is in the &s;trife and the debate, and &s;miting with the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s:" which fa&s;t is not re|quired of the Lord. <Q>Behold, in the day of your fa&s;t you find plea&s;ure, and exact all your labour: behold, ye fa&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;trife and debate, and to &s;mite with the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s, ye &s;hall not fa&s;t, as ye do this day, to make your voice known on high. Is it &s;uch a fa&s;t that I have cho&s;en,</Q> &s;aith the Lord, <Q>a day for a man to afflict his &s;oul? Is it to bow down his head like a bulru&s;h, and to &s;pread &s;ackcloth under him? Wilt thou call this a fa&s;t and an acceptable day to the Lord?</Q></P>
<P>Con&s;ider all you that fa&s;t, &s;ee if it be not <Q>hanging
<PB N="309" REF="037441_0386_100D7FD9C61CE160">down the head for a day like a bulru&s;h,</Q> and fa&s;ting for "&s;trife and debate", and to <Q>&s;mite with the fi&s;ts of wicked|ne&s;s, to make your voice to be known on high?</Q> But this fa&s;t is not accepted with the Lord; but that which leads you from &s;trife, from debate, from wickedne&s;s; which is not the <Q>bowing down of the head as a bulru&s;h for a day,</Q> and yet live in exacting and plea&s;ure; this is not ac|cepted with the Lord: but that which &s;eparates from all the&s;e before-mentioned. That which &s;eparates from <Q>wickedne&s;s, debate, &s;trife, plea&s;ures, &s;miting with the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s,</Q> brings to know the true fa&s;t, which <Q>breaks the bonds of iniquity, and deals bread to the hun|gry; brings the poor that are ca&s;t out to his own hou&s;e; and when he &s;ees any naked he covers them, and hides not him&s;elf from his own fle&s;h.</Q> Here is the true fa&s;t which &s;eparates from them, where the bonds of iniquity are &s;tanding, the heavy burthens of the oppre&s;&s;ed remain|ing, and the yoke not broken; who deal not bread to the hungry, and bring not the poor to their own hou&s;e; and &s;ee the naked but let him go unclothed, and hide them|&s;elves from their own fle&s;h. Yet &s;uch will make their voice to be heard on high, as Chri&s;t &s;peaks of the phari|&s;ces, who <Q>&s;ounded a trumpet before them, and disfr|gured their faces,</Q> to appear to men to fa&s;t; but the bonds of iniquity were &s;tanding, &s;trife and debate was &s;tanding, &s;triking with the fi&s;ts of wickedne&s;s &s;tanding; tho&s;e made their voice heard on high, who had their reward.</P>
<P>But that which brings to the true fa&s;t, which appears not to men to fa&s;t, but unto the Father <Q>who &s;ees in &s;ecret; the Father that &s;eeth in &s;ecret &s;hall reward this openly.</Q> This fa&s;t &s;eparates from the phari&s;ees fa&s;t, and them that "bow the head for a day like a bulru&s;h." This is it which brings <Q>to deal bread to the hungry, and to clothe thine own fle&s;h when thou &s;ee&s;t them naked, to bring the poor to thine hou&s;e, and to loo&s;e the bonds of wickedne&s;s:</Q> mark, this is the fa&s;t; and <Q>to undo every heavy burden (mark again) and to let the opprei&s;&s;ed go free;</Q> this is the fa&s;t: and "to break every yoke." When thou ob&s;erve&s;t this fa&s;t, <Q>Then &s;hall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health &s;hall &s;pring forth &s;pee|dily, and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall go before thee; the glo|ry of the Lord &s;hall be thy rere-ward. Then &s;halt thou call, and the Lord &s;hall an&s;wer; thou &s;halt cry, and he &s;hall &s;ay, Here I am: if thou take away from the
<PB N="310" REF="037441_0387_100D906AE6B38438">mid&s;t of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and &s;peaking vanity: and if thou draw out thy &s;oul to the hungry, and &s;atisfy the afflicted &s;oul, then &s;hall thy light ari&s;e in ob&s;curity, and thy darkne&s;s be as the noon-day.</Q> The light brings to know this fa&s;t; and walking in it, this fa&s;t is kept: and he that believeth in the light, abides not in darkne&s;s. And again; <Q>The Lord &s;hall guide thee continually, and &s;atisfy thy &s;oul in drought, and make fat thy bones; and thou &s;halt be like a watered garden, and like a &s;pring of water, who&s;e waters fail not,</Q> I&s;a. lviii. 11. The&s;e are they that are guided with the light, which comes from Chri&s;t where the &s;prings are.</P>
<P>And again: <Q>They that &s;hall be of thee (that keep this fa&s;t) &s;hall build the old wa&s;te places, and thou &s;halt rai&s;e up the foundation of many generations; and thou &s;halt be called the repairer of the breach, the re&s;torer of paths to dwell in,</Q> I&s;a. lviii. 12. Now that which gives to &s;ee the foundation of many generations, is the light which &s;eparates from all that which is out of the light; and they that go out of the light, though they may pretend a fa&s;t, and bowing down the head for a time: yet they are far from this fa&s;t, that doth rai&s;e up the foundation of many gene|rations, and is the repairer of the breach, and re&s;torer of the paths to dwell in. That which doth give to &s;ee this foundation of many generations, and the&s;e breaches that are to be repaired and re&s;tored, and paths to dwell in, is the light which brings to know the true fa&s;t; and where this fa&s;t is known, which is from wickedne&s;s, from debate, from &s;trife, from plea&s;ures, from exacting, from the voice that is heard on high, from the &s;peaking of vanity, from the bonds of iniquity, which breaks every yoke, and lets the oppre&s;&s;ed go free; here the health grows, here the morning is known, righteou&s;ne&s;s goes forth; the glory of the Lord is the rere-ward, the light ri&s;eth, the &s;oul is drawn out to the hungry, and &s;atisfies the afflicted &s;oul; and the &s;prings of living water are known and felt. The waters fail not here; the Lord guides continually, and the foundation of many generations comes to be &s;een and rai&s;|ed up: the repairer of breaches is here witne&s;&s;ed, the re&s;|torer of paths to dwell in.</P>
<P>But all &s;uch as are out of the light which the prophets were in, with which they &s;aw Chri&s;t, and &s;uch to be in fa&s;ts where was &s;trife, where was wickedne&s;s, where was debate, where was <Q>bowing the head like a bulru&s;h for a
<PB N="311" REF="037441_0388_100D906C7A016550">day,</Q> lifting their voice on high, and the bonds of wick|edne&s;s yet &s;tanding, the burdens unloo&s;ed, the oppre&s;&s;ed not let go free, the yoke not broken, the nakedne&s;s not clothed, the bread not dealt to the hungry, and this foundation of many generations not rai&s;ed up: until the&s;e things before-mentioned be broken down, on &s;uch the light breaks not forth as the morning, and the Lord hears them not. Such have their reward; their iniquities have &s;eparated them from their God, their &s;ins have hid his face from them that he will not hear, their hands are de|filed with blood, and their fingers with iniquity; who&s;e lips have &s;poken lies, and tongues have muttered per|ver&s;ene&s;s. <Q>None calleth for ju&s;tice, nor any plead for truth; they tru&s;t in vanity and &s;peak lies, they conceive mi&s;chief and bring forth iniquity. They hatch cockatrice eggs, and weave the &s;pider's web; he that eateth of their eggs, dies, and that which is cru&s;hed breaks out into a vi|per; their webs &s;hall not become garments, neither &s;hall they cover them&s;elves with their works.</Q> Mark and take notice: <Q>Their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands: their feet run to do evil, and they make ha&s;te to &s;hed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, wa&s;ting and de&s;truction are in their paths; the way of peace they know not, and there is no judgment in their doings. They have made them a crooked path; who&s;oever goes therein &s;hall not know peace:</Q> mark: Such go from the light, therefore is judg|ment far off, neither doth ju&s;tice overtake. Here is ob|&s;curity, here is the walking in darkne&s;s, here is the grop|ing like blind men, as though they had no eyes, and their &s;tumbling at noon-day in de&s;olate places, like blind men. Here is the roaring like bears, and mourning &s;orely like doves; here judgment is looked for, but there is none, and &s;alvation is put far off: for the light is denied, which gives to &s;ee it. But here is the multiplying of tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion, and their &s;ins te&s;tifying again&s;t them, and the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion that was within them, and their iniquities which they knew in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing and lying again&s;t the Lord, &s;peaking the things they &s;hould not; when they knew by that of God in them, they &s;hould not &s;peak it. So de|parting from the way of God, &s;peaking oppre&s;&s;ion, re|volting, conceiving and uttering forth from the heart words of fal&s;ehood; here judgment is turned away backward, and ju&s;tice &s;tands afar off: truth is fallen in the &s;treets, and
<PB N="312" REF="037441_0389_100D906EDD1079B8">equity cannot enter. Yea, truth faileth; and he that de|parteth from evil, makes him&s;elf a prey! The Lord &s;aw it, and it di&s;plea&s;ed him. The&s;e are &s;uch as are in the fa&s;t which God doth not accept; and are not in the true fa&s;t, who&s;e "light breaks forth as the morning:" but the&s;e are &s;uch as are in the fal&s;e fa&s;t. who grope like blind men.</P>
<P>That which gives to know the true and fal&s;e fa&s;t, is the light, which gives the eye to &s;ee each fa&s;t; where the true judgment is, and the iniquity &s;tandeth not, nor the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, nor the &s;peaker of lies: but that is judged 'and condemned with the light, which makes it manife&s;t. And tho&s;e who are in this fa&s;t, when they call upon the Lord, the Lord will an&s;wer them, "Here am I." Here truth is pleaded for and fal&s;ehood flies away. But they who are out of this fa&s;t in the perver&s;ene&s;s, their tongues uttering perver&s;e things, are &s;tumbling and groping like blind men, out of the light, in the iniquity which &s;epa|rates from God, who hides his face from them that he will not hear: going from the light, they go from the Lord and his face. So this is it which mu&s;t be fa&s;t|ed from, for this it is which &s;eparates from God: and here comes the reward openly, which condemns all that which is contrary to the light; inju&s;tice, iniquity, tra&s;gre&s;&s;ion, vanity, that which brings forth mi&s;chief; which hatcheth the cockatrice-eggs, and weaves the &s;pi|ders web: he that eateth of the&s;e eggs, dies. Mark, That "which is cru&s;hed breaks out into a viper." Mark again, <Q>Their webs &s;hall not become garments, neither &s;hall they cover them&s;elves with their works of vanity: acts of violence are in their hands.</Q> This is all from the light, in the wickedne&s;s. <Q>Their &s;eet run to do evil, and they make ha&s;te to &s;hed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of vanity, wa&s;ting and de&s;truction is in their path.</Q> This is all far from the light. Again. <Q>The way of peace they know not, there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths, who&s;oever goes therein &s;hall not know peace.</Q> Mark; who goes in their way, that know not the way of peace, &s;hall they know peace? <Q>Who&s;e path is crooked, where there is no judgment in their goings:</Q> take notice, <Q>No judg|ment in their goings:</Q> This is all from the light, which ma|nife&s;teth that which is to be judged; where the covenant of peace is known, where all that which is contrary to it is kept out. All who live in tho&s;e things contrary to the
<PB N="313" REF="037441_0390_100D9071318AA5D0">light, in the fal&s;e fa&s;t, may mark their path, and behold their reward; who are out of the light, &s;tumbling and groping like blind men. They that be in the true fa&s;t are &s;eparated from all the&s;e; their words, their actions and fruits, and their fa&s;t; but to tho&s;e who&s;e fa&s;t breaks the bonds of iniquity, whom the Lord hears, and to whom righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;prings forth, and goes before them, the glory of the Lord is their rere-ward.</P>

<P>We pa&s;&s;ed into Wales through Montgomery&s;hire, and &s;o into Radnor&s;hire, where there was a meeting like a leaguer, for multitudes. I walked a little a&s;ide, whil&s;t the people were gathering: and there came to me John-ap-John, a Wel&s;hman, whom I de&s;ired to go to the people; and if he had any thing upon him from the Lord to them, he might &s;peak in Wel&s;h, and thereby gather more together. Then came Morgan Watkins to me, who was become loving to friends, and &s;aid, <Q>The people lie like a leaguer, and the gentry of the country are come in.</Q> I bade him go up al&s;o, and leave me; for I had a great travail upon me for the &s;alvation of the people. When they were well ga|thered, I went into the meeting, and &s;tood upon a chair about three hours. I &s;tood a pretty while, before I geban to &s;peak: after &s;ome time I felt the power of the Lord over the whole a&s;&s;embly: and his everla&s;ting life and truth &s;hined over all. <Q>The &s;criptures were opened to them, and the objections they had in their minds an&s;wered. They were directed to the light of Chri&s;t, the heavenly man; that by it they might &s;ee their &s;ins, and Chri&s;t Je&s;us to be their Saviour, their Redeemer, their Mediator, and come to &s;eed upon him, the bread of life from heaven. Many were turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to his free teach|ing that day; and all were bowed down under the power of God; &s;o that though the multitude was &s;o great that many &s;at on hor&s;eback to hear, there was no oppo&s;ition. A prie&s;t &s;at with his wife on hor&s;eback, heard attentively, and made no objection. The people parted peaceably, with great &s;atisfaction; many of them &s;aying, They never heard &s;uch a &s;ermon before, nor the &s;criptures &s;o opened. For the new covenant was opened, and the old, the na|ture and terms of each, and the parables were explained. The &s;tate of the church in the apo&s;tles days was &s;et forth, the apo&s;tacy &s;ince laid open; and the free teaching of
<PB N="314" REF="037441_0391_100D9072C7FBE648">Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles was &s;et atop of all the hireling teach|ers; and the Lord had the prai&s;e of all, for many were turned to him that day.</Q></P>
<P>I went from thence to Leomin&s;ter, where was a great meeting in a clo&s;e; many hundreds of people being gather|ed together. There were about &s;ix congregational preach|ers and prie&s;ts among&s;t the people; and Thomas Taylor, who had been a prie&s;t, but was now become a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, was with me. I &s;tood up, and declared about three hours; and none of the prie&s;ts were able to open their mouths in oppo&s;ition; the Lord's power and truth &s;o reached and bound them. At length one prie&s;t went off about a bow-&s;hot from me; drew &s;everal of the people after him, and began to preach to them. So I kept our meet|ing, and he kept his. After awhile Thomas Taylor was moved to go and &s;peak to him; upon which he gave over: and he, with the people he had drawn off, came to us again; and the Lord's power went over all. At la&s;t a Bapti&s;t, that was convinced, &s;aid, <Q>Where's prie&s;t Tombs? how chance he doth not come out?</Q> This Tombs was prie&s;t of Leomin&s;ter. Hereupon &s;ome went and told the prie&s;t; who came with the bailiffs and other officers of the town. When he was come, they &s;et him upon a &s;tool over again&s;t me. I was &s;peaking of the heavenly, divine light of Chri&s;t, which he <Q>enlightens every one withal that com|eth into the world; to give them the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chri&s;t Je&s;us their Saviour.</Q> When prie&s;t Tombs heard this, he cried out, <Q>That is a natural light, and a made light.</Q> Then I de&s;ired the peo|ple to take out their bibles, and a&s;ked the prie&s;t, <Q>Whether he did affirm that was a created, natural, made light, which John, a man &s;ent from God, bore witne&s;s to, when he &s;aid, <Q>In him (to wit, in the Word) was life, and that life was the light of men,</Q> John i. 4. Do&s;t thou affirm and mean, &s;aid I, that this light here &s;poken of was a created, natural, made light? He &s;aid, Yes. Then I &s;hewed by the &s;criptures, that the natural, created, made light is the out|ward light in the outward firmament, proceeding from the fun, moon, and &s;tars? "And do&s;t thou affirm," &s;aid I, <Q>that God &s;ent John to bear witne&s;s to the light of the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars?</Q> "Then," &s;aid he, "Did I &s;ay &s;o?" I replied, <Q>Did&s;t thou not &s;ay it was a natural, created, made light, that John bore witne&s;s unto? If thou do&s;t not like thy words, take them again, and mend them.</Q>
<PB N="315" REF="037441_0392_100D90745B7BFED8">Then he &s;aid <Q>That light, which I &s;poke of, was a na|tural, created light.</Q> I told him, He had not at all mended his cau&s;e; for that light, which I &s;poke of, was the very &s;ame that John was &s;ent of God to bear witne&s;s to; which was the life in the Word, by which all the na|tural lights, &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, were made.</Q> <Q>In him (to wit, the Word) was life, and that life was the light of men.</Q> I directed the people to turn to the place in their bibles, and recited to them the words of John, <Q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The &s;ame was in the beginning with God: All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.</Q> (So all natural, created lights were made by Chri&s;t the Word.) <Q>In him was life, and the life was the light of men: and that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</Q> And Chri&s;t &s;aith of him&s;elf, John viii. 12. 'I am the light of the world:' and bids them 'believe in the light,' John xii. 36. And God &s;aid of him by the prophet I&s;aiah, ch. xlix. 6. <Q>I will al&s;o give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou maye&s;t be my &s;alvation to the ends of the earth.</Q> So Chri&s;t in his light is &s;aving. And the apo&s;tle &s;aid, <Q>The light, which &s;hined in their hearts, was to give them the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</Q> which was their trea&s;ure in their earthen ve&s;&s;els, 2 Cor. iv. 6, 7.</P>
<P>When I had thus opened the matter to the people, the prie&s;t cried to the magi&s;trates, <Q>Take this man away, or el&s;e I &s;hall not &s;peak any more.</Q> 'But,' &s;aid I, <Q>prie&s;t Tombs, deceive not thy&s;elf, thou art not in thy pulpit now, nor in thy old ma&s;s-hou&s;e; but we are in the fields.</Q> So he was &s;huffling to be gone: and Thomas Taylor &s;tood up, and undertook to prove our principle by Chri&s;t's para|ble concerning the &s;ower, Mat. 13. Then &s;aid the prie&s;t, 'Let that man &s;peak, and not the other.' So he got up into jangling for awhile; till the Lord's power catched him again, &s;topped and confounded him. Afterwards a friend &s;tood up and told him, He had &s;ued him for tithe eggs, and other friends for other tithes: for he was an Anabapti&s;t preacher, yet had a par&s;onage at Leomin&s;ter, and had &s;e|veral journeymen under him. He &s;aid, <Q>He had a wife, and he had a concubine; his wife was the baptized people, and his concubine was the world.</Q> But the Lord's power
<PB N="316" REF="037441_0393_100D90770B6F5670">came over all, the everla&s;ting truth was declared that day, and many were turned by it to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their teacher and way to God. Of great &s;ervice that meeting was in tho&s;e parts. The next day Thomas Taylor went to this prie&s;t, rea&s;oned with him, and overcame him by the power of the Word.</P>
<P>From this place I travelled in Wales, having &s;everal meetings, till I came to Tenby; where as I rode up the &s;treet, a ju&s;tice of peace came out of his hou&s;e, de&s;ired me to alight, and &s;tay at his hou&s;e; which I did. On fir&s;t-day the mayor with his wife, and &s;everal others of the chief of the town, came in about the tenth hour, and &s;taid all the time of the meeting. A glorious meeting it was. John-ap-John being then with me, left the meeting, and went to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e; and the governor ca&s;t him into pri&s;on. On &s;econd-day morning the governor &s;ent one of his officers to the ju&s;tice's to fetch me; which grieved the mayor and the ju&s;tice; for they were both with me in the ju&s;tice's hou&s;e, when the officer came. The mayor and the ju&s;tice went to the governor before me; and awhile af|ter I went with the officer. When I came in I &s;aid, 'Peace be unto this hou&s;e.' And before the governor could examine me, I a&s;ked him, <Q>Why he ca&s;t my friend into pri&s;on?</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>For &s;tanding with his hat on in the church.</Q> I &s;aid, <Q>Had not the prie&s;t two caps on his head, a black one and a white one? Cut off the brims of the hat, and then my friend would have but one; and the brims of the hat were but to defend him from weather.</Q> 'The&s;e are frivolous things,' &s;aid the governor. <Q>Why then,</Q> &s;aid I. <Q>do&s;t thou ca&s;t my friend into pri&s;on for &s;uch frivolous things?</Q> He a&s;ked me, <Q>Whether I owned election and reprobation?</Q> 'Yes,' &s;aid I, <Q>and thou art in the reprobation.</Q> At that he was in a rage, and &s;aid, 'He would &s;end me to pri&s;on till I proved it.' I told him, <Q>I would prove that quickly, if he would confe&s;s truth.</Q> I a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether wrath, fury, rage, and per&s;ecution. were not marks of reprobation? for he that was born of the fle&s;h, per&s;ecuted him that was born of the Spirit; but Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples never per&s;ecuted nor impri&s;oned any.</Q> He fairly confe&s;&s;ed, That he had too much wrath, ha&s;te, and pa&s;&s;ion in him. I told him, <Q>E&s;au was up in him, the fir&s;t birth; not Jacob, the &s;econd birth.</Q> The Lord's power &s;o reached the man, and came
<PB N="317" REF="037441_0394_100D9078FB08C718">over him, that he confe&s;&s;ed to truth; and the other ju&s;tice came, and &s;hook me kindly by the hand.</P>
<P>As I was pa&s;&s;ing away, I was moved to &s;peak to the governor again; and he invited me to dinner with him; and &s;et my friend at liberty. I went back to the other ju&s;tice's hou&s;e: and after &s;ome time the mayor and his wife, and the ju&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice and his wife, and divers other friends of the town, went about half a mile out of town with us, to the water-&s;ide, when we went away; and there, when we part|ed from them, I was moved of the Lord to <Q>kneel down with them, and pray to the Lord to pre&s;erve them.</Q> So after I had recommended them to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their Saviour and free teacher, we pa&s;&s;ed away in the Lord's power; and he had the glory. A meeting continues in that town to this day.</P>
<P>We travelled to Pembroke&s;hire; and in Pembroke town had &s;ome &s;ervice for the Lord. From thence we pa&s;&s;ed to Haverford-we&s;t, where we had a great meeting. All was quiet; the Lord's power came over all, many were &s;ettled in the new covenant, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and built upon him, their rock and foundation: and they &s;tand a precious meet|ing to this day. The next day, being their fair-day, we pa&s;&s;ed through the fair, and <Q>&s;ounded the day of the Lord, and his everla&s;ting truth among&s;t them.</Q></P>
<P>After this we came into another county, and at noon into a great market town; and went to &s;everal inns, before we could get any meat for our hor&s;es. At la&s;t we came to one, where we got &s;ome. Then John-ap-John being with me, went, and &s;poke through the town, declaring the truth to the people; and when he came to me again, he &s;aid he thought all the town were as people a&s;leep. After awhile he was moved to go and declare truth in the &s;treets again; then the town was all in an uproar, and ca&s;t him into pri&s;on. Pre&s;ently after, &s;everal of the chief of the town came down, with others, to the inn where I was, and &s;aid, 'They have ca&s;t your man into pri&s;on.' 'For what?' &s;aid I. 'He preached in our &s;treets,' &s;aid they. I a&s;ked them, <Q>What did he &s;ay? Had he reproved &s;ome of the drunkards and &s;wearers, and warned them to repent, and leave off their evil doings, and turn to the Lord?</Q> I a&s;ked them, 'Who ca&s;t him into pri&s;on?' They &s;aid, 'The high-&s;heriff, the ju&s;tices, and the mayor.' I a&s;ked their names, and whether they under&s;tood them&s;elves? and whether that was their carriage to travellers who pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="318" REF="037441_0395_100D907A9239DCF0">through their town; and to &s;trangers that admoni&s;hed them, and exhorted them to fear the Lord, and reproved &s;in in their gates? The&s;e went and told the officers what I &s;aid; and after awhile they brought John-ap-John guarded with halberds, in order to put him out of the town. I being at the inn-door, bid the officers take their hands off of him. They &s;aid, <Q>The mayor and ju&s;tices had commanded them to put him out of town.</Q> I told them, <Q>I would talk with their mayor and ju&s;tices anon concerning their un|civil and unchri&s;tian carriage towards him.</Q> I &s;poke to John to go look after the hor&s;es, and get them ready; and charged the officers not to touch him; and after I had de|clared the truth to them, and &s;hewed the fruits of their prie&s;ts, and their incivility and unchri&s;tian-like carriage, they went away and left us. They were a kind of Inde|pendents; a very wicked town, and fal&s;e. We bid the inn-keeper give our hor&s;es a peck of oats; and no &s;ooner had we turned our backs, but the oats were &s;tolen from our hor&s;es. After we had refre&s;hed our&s;elves a little, and were ready, we took hor&s;e, and rode up to the inn, where the mayor, &s;heriff, and ju&s;tices were. I called to &s;peak with them, and a&s;ked them the rea&s;on, <Q>Wherefore they had impri&s;oned John-ap-John, and kept him in pri&s;on two or three hours?</Q> But they would not an&s;wer me a word; only looked out at the windows upon me. I &s;hewed them <Q>how unchri&s;tian their carriage was to &s;trangers and travel|lers, and manife&s;ted the fruits of their teachers; and de|clared the truth to them, and warned them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all the evil-doers: and the Lord's power came over them, that they looked a&s;ha|med;</Q> but not a word could I get from them in an&s;wer. So when I had warned them to repent, and turn to the Lord, we pa&s;&s;ed away; and at night came to a little inn, very poor, but very cheap; for our own provi&s;ion, and our two hor&s;es co&s;t but eight pence: but the hor&s;es would not eat their oats. We declared the truth to the people of the place, and &s;ounded the day of the Lord thro' the countries.</P>
<P>From thence we came to a great town, and went to an inn. Edward Edwards went into the market, and declared the truth among&s;t the people; who followed him to the inn, &s;illed the inn-yard, and were exceeding rude. Yet a good &s;ervice we had for the Lord among&s;t them. For the life of chri&s;tianity and the power of it tormented their chaffy &s;pi|rits, and came over them, &s;o that &s;ome were reached and
<PB N="319" REF="037441_0396_100D907C8178D0D8">convinced; the Lord's power came over all; and the ma|gi&s;trates were bound, they had no power to meddle with us.</P>
<P>After this we came to another great town on a market-day; where John-ap-John declared the everla&s;ting truth through the &s;treets, and proclaimed the day of the Lord. In the evening many gathered about the inn; and &s;ome of them, being drunk, would fain have had us into the &s;treet again; but &s;eeing their de&s;ign, I told them, <Q>If there were any that feared God, and de&s;ired to hear truth, they might come into our inn; or el&s;e we might have a meeting with them next morning.</Q> Some &s;ervice for the Lord we had among&s;t them, both over night and in the morning: and though they were hard to receive the truth, yet the &s;eed was &s;own; and thereabouts the Lord hath a people gather|ed to him&s;elf. In that inn al&s;o I turned my back to the man that was giving oats to my hor&s;e; and looking back, he was filling his pockets with the provender. A wicked, thievi&s;h people, to rob the poor dumb creature of his food! I had rather they had robbed me.</P>
<P>Leaving this town, and travelling on, a great man over|took us on the way. He purpo&s;ed (as he told us afterwards) to have taken us up at the next town for highwaymen. But before we came to the town, I was moved of the Lord to &s;peak to him. What I &s;poke, reached to the witne&s;s of God in the man; who was &s;o affected therewith, that he had us to his hou&s;e, and entertained us very civilly. He and his wife de&s;ired us to give them &s;ome &s;criptures, both for proof of our principles, and again&s;t the prie&s;ts. We were glad of the &s;ervice, and furni&s;hed him with &s;criptures enough; and he wrote them down, and was convinced of the truth, both by the Spirit of God in his own heart, and by the &s;criptures, which were a confirmation to him. Af|terwards he &s;et us on in our journey; and as we travelled, we came to an hill, which the people of the country &s;ay is two or three miles high; from the &s;ide of this hill I could &s;ee a great way. And I was moved to &s;et my face &s;everal ways, and to &s;ound the day of the Lord there: and I told John-ap-John (a faithful Wel&s;h mini&s;ter) in what places God would rai&s;e up a people to him&s;elf, to &s;it under his own teaching. Tho&s;e places he took notice of; and &s;ince there hath been a great people ari&s;en there. The like I have been moved to do in many other parts inhabited by rude people: yet I have been moved to declare the Lord had a &s;eed in tho&s;e places: and afterwards there hath been a brave
<PB N="320" REF="037441_0397_100D907EDC0CE498">people rai&s;ed up in the covenant of God, and gathered in the name of Je&s;us; where they have &s;alvation and free teaching.</P>
<P>From this hill we came to Dolegelle: and went to an inn. John-ap-John declared through the &s;treets; and the town's people ro&s;e and gathered about him. There being two Independent prie&s;ts in the town, they came out, and di&s;cour&s;ed with him both together. I went to them: and finding them &s;peaking in Wel&s;h, I a&s;ked them, <Q>What was the &s;ubject they &s;poke upon, and why they were not more moderate, and &s;poke one by one? For the things of God,</Q> I told them, <Q>were weighty, and they &s;hould &s;peak of them with fear and reverence.</Q> Then I de&s;ired them to &s;peak in Engli&s;h, that I might di&s;cour&s;e with them; and they did &s;o. They affirmed, <Q>That the Light, which John came to bear witne&s;s of, was a created, natural, made light.</Q>I took the bible, and &s;hewed them (as I had done to others before) <Q>That the natural lights, which were made and created, were the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars: but this light, which John bare witne&s;s to, and which he called the true light, that lighteth every man that cometh into the world, is the life in Chri&s;t the Word, by which all things were made and created. The &s;ame that is called the life in Chri&s;t, is called the light in man. This is an heavenly, divine light, which lets men &s;ee their evil words and deeds, and &s;hews them all their &s;ins; and (if they would attend to it) would bring them to Chri&s;t, from whom it comes, that they might know him to &s;ave them from their &s;in, and to blot it out. This light, I told them, &s;hined in the darkne&s;s in their hearts, and the darkne&s;s in them could not comprehend it; but in tho&s;e hearts, where God had commanded it to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, it gave unto &s;uch the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chri&s;t Je&s;us their Saviour. I opened the &s;criptures largely to them, and turned them to the Spirit of God in their hearts; which would reveal the my&s;teries in the &s;criptures to them, and would lead them into all truth, as they became &s;ub|ject thereunto. I directed them to that which would give every one of them the knowledge of Chri&s;t, who died for them; that he might be their way to God, and might make peace betwixt God and them.</Q> The people were attentive, and I de&s;ired John-ap-John to &s;tand up, and &s;peak it in Wel&s;h to them; which he did: and they gene|rally received it, and with hands lifted up, ble&s;&s;ed and prai&s;|ed
<PB N="321" REF="037441_0398_100D9080D5B5E838">God. The prie&s;ts mouths were &s;topped, &s;o that they were quiet all the while; for I had brought them to be &s;o|ber at the fir&s;t, by telling them, <Q>when they &s;poke of the things of God and of Chri&s;t, they &s;hould &s;peak with fear and reverence.</Q> Thus the meeting broke up in peace in the &s;treet. Many of the people accompanied us to our inn, re|joiced in the truth that had been declared to them; and that they were turned to the light and Spirit in them&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, by which they might &s;ee their &s;in, and know &s;alvation from it. When we went out of the twon, the people were &s;o affected, that they lifted up their hands, and ble&s;&s;ed the Lord for our coming. A precious &s;eed the Lord hath there-away; and a great people in tho&s;e parts is &s;ince gathered to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to &s;it under his free teaching; and they have &s;uffered much for him.</P>
<P>From this place we pa&s;&s;ed to Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rnarvon, a town like a ca&s;tle. When we had &s;et up our hor&s;es at an inn, and re|fre&s;hed our&s;elves, John-ap-John went and &s;poke through the &s;treets; which were &s;o &s;traight and &s;hort, that one might &s;tand in the mid&s;t of the town, and &s;ee both the gates. I followed John-ap-John, and a multitude were &s;oon gather|ed about him; among&s;t whom a very dark prie&s;t began to babble; but his mouth was &s;oon &s;topped. When John had cleared him&s;elf, I declared the word of life among&s;t the people; <Q>directing them to the light of Chri&s;t in their hearts, that by it they might &s;ee all their own ways, religions, and teachers, and might come off from them all to Chri&s;t, the true and living way, and the free teacher.</Q> Some of the people were rude, but the greater part were civil; and told us, <Q>They had heard how we had been per&s;ecuted and abu&s;ed in many places, but they would not do &s;o to us there.</Q> I commended their moderation and &s;obriety, <Q>and warned them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all &s;in and wickedne&s;s; te&s;tifying unto them, that Chri&s;t was now come to teach his people him&s;elf, by his Spirit and power.</Q></P>
<P>From hence we went to Beaumaris, a twon wherein John-ap-John had formerly been a preacher. After we had put up our hor&s;es at an inn, John went and &s;poke through the &s;treet; and there being a garri&s;on in the town, they took him, and put him into pri&s;on. The inn-keeper's wife came, and told me, <Q>That the governor and magi&s;trates were &s;end|ing for me, to commit me to pri&s;on al&s;o.' I told her, They had done more than they could an&s;wer already;
<PB N="322" REF="037441_0399_100D9082671D9490">and had acted contrary to chri&s;tianity in impri&s;oning him for reproving &s;in in their &s;treets and gates, and for declar|ing the truth.</Q> Soon after came other friendly people, and told me, <Q>If I went into the &s;treet, they would impri&s;on me al&s;o; therefore they de&s;ired me to keep within the inn.</Q> Upon this I was moved to go and walk up and down in the &s;treets; and told the people, 'What an uncivil, unchri&s;ti|an 'thing they had done, in ca&s;ting my friend into pri&s;on. And they being high profe&s;&s;ors, I a&s;ked them, <Q>If this was the entertainment they had for &s;trangers? And if they would willingly be &s;o &s;erved them&s;elves? And whether they, who looked upon the &s;criptures to be their rule, had any example in the &s;criptures, from Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles, for what they had done?"</Q> So after awhile they &s;et John-ap-John at liberty.</P>
<P>Next day, being market-day, we were to cro&s;s a great water; and not far from the place where we were to take boat, many of the market-people drew to us; among&s;t whom we had good &s;ervice for the Lord, <Q>declaring the word of life and everla&s;ting truth unto them, and proclaiming the day of the Lord among&s;t them, which was coming upon all wickedne&s;s; and directing them to the light of Chri&s;t, which he, the heavenly man, had enlightened them with|al; by which they might &s;ee all their &s;ins, and all their fal&s;e ways, religions, wor&s;hips and teachers: and by the &s;ame light might &s;ee Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who was come to &s;ave them, and lead them to God.</Q> After the truth had been declared to them in the power of God, and Chri&s;t the free teacher &s;et over all the hireling teachers; I bid John-ap-John get his hor&s;e into the boat, which was then ready. But there being a company of wild gentlemen, as they cal|led them, got into it, whom we found very rude, and far from gentlene&s;s; they, with others, kept his hor&s;e out of the boat. I rode to the boat's &s;ide, and &s;poke to them, &s;hewing them, <Q>What an unmanly and unchri&s;tian carriage it was; and told them, they &s;hewed an unworthy &s;pirit, below chri&s;tianity or humanity.</Q> As I &s;poke, I leaped my hor&s;e into the boat among&s;t them; thinking John's hor&s;e would have followed, when he had &s;een mine go in before him: but the water being pretty deep, John could not get his hor&s;e into the boat. Wherefore I leaped out again on hor&s;eback into the water, and &s;taid with John on that &s;ide, till the boat returned. There we tarried from the eleventh hour of the forenoon to the &s;econd in the afternoon,
<PB N="323" REF="037441_0400_100D90845D4CCF08">before the boat came to fetch us; and then had forty-two miles to ride that evening; and by that time we had paid for our pa&s;&s;age, we had but one groat left between us in money. We rode about &s;ixteen miles, and then got a little hay for our hor&s;es. Setting forward again, we came in the night to a little ale-hou&s;e, where we thought to have &s;taid and baited. But finding we could have neither oats nor hay there, we travelled all night; and about the fifth hour in the morning got to a place within &s;ix miles of Wrexham; where that day we met with many friends, and had a glo|rious meeting; the Lord's everla&s;ting power and truth was over all: and a meeting is continued there to this day. Ve|ry weary we were with travelling &s;o hard up and down in Wales; and in many places we found it difficult to get meat either for our hor&s;es or our&s;elves.</P>
<P>The next day we pa&s;&s;ed from thence into Flint&s;hire, &s;ounding the day of the Lord through the towns: and came into Wrexham at night. Here many of Floyd's people came to us; but very rude, wild, and airy they were, and little &s;en&s;e of truth they had: yet &s;ome were convinced in that town. Next morning one called a lady &s;ent for me, who kept a preacher in her hou&s;e. I went to her hou&s;e, but found both her and her preacher very light and airy; too light to receive the weighty things of God. In her lightne&s;s &s;he came and a&s;ked me, 'If &s;he &s;hould cut my hair? I was moved to reprove her, and bid her cut down the corrup|tions in her&s;elf with the &s;word of the Spirit of God; &s;o after I had admoni&s;hed her to be more grave and &s;ober, we pa&s;&s;|ed away. Afterwards in her frothy mind &s;he made her boa&s;t, that &s;he, 'came behind me, and cut off the curl of my hair;' but &s;he &s;poke fal&s;ely.</P>
<P>From Wrexham we came to We&s;t-che&s;ter; and it being the fair-time, we &s;taid there awhile, and vi&s;ited friends. For I had travelled through every county in Wales, preach|ing the everla&s;ting go&s;pel of Chri&s;t: and a brave people there is now, who have received it, and &s;it under Chri&s;t's teaching. But before I left Wales, I wrote to the magi&s;|trates of Beaumaris concerning their impri&s;oning John-ap-John; letting them &s;ee their condition, the fruits of their chri&s;tianity, and of their teachers. Afterwards I met with &s;ome of them near London; but oh! how a&s;hamed they were of their action!</P>
<P>From We&s;t-che&s;ter we came to Liverpool, where was at that time a fair; and as I rode through the fair, there &s;tood
<PB N="324" REF="037441_0401_100D9086B71E5618">a friend upon the cro&s;s, declaring the truth to the people; who &s;eeing me ride by, and knowing I had appointed a meeting to be the next day upon an hill not far off, gave notice to the people, <Q>That George Fox, the &s;ervant of the Lord, would have a meeting next day upon &s;uch an hill; and if any feared the Lord, they might come and hear him declare the word of life to them.</Q> We went that night to Richard Cubban's, who him&s;elf was convinced, though not his wife; but at that time &s;he was convinced al&s;o.</P>
<P>Next day we went to the meeting on the top of the hill, which was very large. Some rude people with a prie&s;t's wife came, and made a noi&s;e for awhile; but the Lord's power came over them, the meeting became quiet, and the truth of God was declared among&s;t them. Many were that day &s;ettled upon the rock and foundation Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and under his teaching; who made peace betwixt God and them.</P>
<P>We had a &s;mall meeting with a few friends and people at Malpoth. From thence we came to another place, where we had a meeting. There came a bailiff with a &s;word, and was rude; but the Lord's power came over him, and friends were e&s;tabli&s;hed in the truth.</P>
<P>From thence we came to Manche&s;ter: and the &s;e&s;&s;ions being there that day, many rude people were come out of the country. In the meeting they threw at me coals, clods, &s;tones, and water: yet the Lord's power bore me up over them, that they could not &s;trike me down. At la&s;t, when they &s;aw they could not prevail by throwing water, &s;tones, and dirt at me, they went and informed the ju&s;tices in the &s;e&s;&s;ions; who thereupon &s;ent officers to fetch me before of life to the people, plucked me down, and haled me into their court. When I came there all the court was in a di&s;|order and a noi&s;e. Wherefore I a&s;ked, <Q>Where were the magi&s;trates, that they did not keep the people civil?</Q> Some of the ju&s;tices &s;aid, They were magi&s;trates. I a&s;ked them, <Q>Why then they did not appea&s;e the people, and keep them &s;ober?</Q> For one cried, I'll &s;wear, and another cried, I'll &s;wear. I declared to the ju&s;tices, <Q>How we were abu&s;ed in our meeting by the rude people, who threw &s;tones, clods, dirt, and water: and how I was haled out of the meeting and brought thither, contrary to the in&s;trument of government,</Q> which &s;aid, <Q>None &s;hould be mole&s;ted in
<PB N="325" REF="037441_0402_100D908949A72160">their meetings that profe&s;&s;ed God, and owned the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</Q> which I did.' The truth &s;o came over them, that when one of the rude followers cried, <Q>He would &s;wear;</Q> one of the ju&s;tices checked him, &s;aying, 'What, will you &s;wear? hold your tongue.' At la&s;t they bid the con&s;table, <Q>Have me to my lodging, and there I &s;hould be &s;ecured till to-morrow morning that they &s;ent for me again.</Q> So the con&s;table had me to my lodging. As we went the people were exceeding rude; but I let them &s;ee the <Q>fruits of their teachers, how they &s;hamed chri&s;tia|nity, and di&s;honoured the name of Je&s;us which they pro|fe&s;&s;ed.</Q> At night we went to a ju&s;tice's in the town, who was pretty moderate, and I had a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e with him. Next morning we &s;ent to the con&s;table to know if he had any thing more to &s;ay to us? He &s;ent us word, <Q>He had nothing to &s;ay to us, we might go whither we would.</Q> The Lord hath &s;ince rai&s;ed up a people to &s;tand for his name and truth in that town over tho&s;e chaffy pro|fe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed from Manche&s;ter, having many precious meetings in &s;erveral places, till we came to Pre&s;ton; be|tween which and Lanca&s;ter I had a general meeting: from which I went to Lanca&s;ter. There at our inn I met with colonel We&s;t, who was very glad to &s;ee me; who meeting with judge Fell, told him, <Q>I was mightily grown in the tuth;</Q> when indeed he was come nearer to the truth, and &s;o could better di&s;cern it.</P>
<P>We came from Lanca&s;ter to Robert Widders's. On the fir&s;t-day after I had a general meeting near the Sands-&s;ide, of friends of We&s;tmoreland and Lanca&s;hire, when the Lord's everla&s;ting power was over all; in which the word of eternal life was declared, and friends were &s;ettled upon the foundation, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, under his free teaching; and many were convinced, and turned to the Lord.</P>
<P>Next day I came over the Sands to Swarthmore, where friends were glad to &s;ee me. I &s;taid there two fir&s;t-days, vi|&s;iting friends in their meetings there-away. They rejoiced with me in the goodne&s;s of the Lord, who by his eternal power had carried me through and over, many difficul|ties and dangers in his &s;ervice; to him be the prai&s;e for ever!</P>
<P>Having got a little re&s;pite from travel, I was moved to write an epi&s;tle to friends, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="326" REF="037441_0403_100D908ADB8A2008">
<P>ALL friends of the Lord every where, who&s;e minds are turned in towards the Lord, take heed to the light within you, which is the light of Chri&s;t; which, as you love it, will call your minds inward, that are abroad in the creatures: &s;o your minds may be renewed by it, and turned to God in this which is pure, to wor&s;hip the living God, the Lord of ho&s;ts over all the creatures. That which calls your minds out of the lu&s;ts of the world, will call them out of the affections and de&s;ires, and turn you to &s;et your affections above. The &s;ame that calls the mind out of the world, will give judgment upon the world's affections and lu&s;ts, that which calls out your minds from the world's teachers and the creatures, to have your minds renewed. There is your obedience known and found; there the image of God is renewed in you, and ye come to grow up in it. That which calls your minds out of the earth, turns them towards God, where the pure Babe is born of the virgin; and the Babe's food is known, the children's bread, which comes from the liv|ing God, and nouri&s;hes up to eternal life: which babes and children receive their wi&s;dom from above, from the pure living God, and not from the earthly one; for that is trodden under foot by &s;uch. All who hate this light, who&s;e minds are abroad in the creatures, in the earth, and in the image of the devil, get the words of the &s;aints (that received their wi&s;dom from above) into the old nature and their corrupted minds. Such are murderers of the ju&s;t, enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, in whom the prince of the air lodgeth, &s;ons of perdition, betrayers of the ju&s;t. Therefore take heed to that light, which is oppre&s;&s;ed with that nature; which light, as it ari&s;es, &s;hall condemn all that cur&s;ed nature, &s;hall turn it out, and &s;hut it out of the hou&s;e. So ye will come to &s;ee the candle lighted, and the hou&s;e &s;weeping and &s;wept. Then the pure pearl ari&s;eth, then the eternal God is exalted. The &s;ame light that calls in your minds out of the world (that are abroad) the &s;ame turns them to God the father of lights. Here in the pure mind is the pure God waited upon for wi&s;dom from above; the pure God is &s;een night and day, and the eternal peace, of which there is no end, enjoyed. People may have openings, and yet their minds go into the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h; but there the affections are not mortified. Therefore hearken to that, take heed to that, which calls your minds out of the affections and lu&s;ts of the world
<PB N="327" REF="037441_0404_100D908C6F2C1C60">to have them renewed. The &s;ame will turn your minds to God; the &s;ame light will &s;et your affections above, and bring you to wait for the pure wi&s;dom of God from on high, that it may be ju&s;tified in you. Wait all in that which calls in your minds and turns them to God; here is the true cro&s;s. That mind &s;hall feed upon nothing that is earthly, but be kept in the pure light up to God, to feed upon the living food which comes from the living God. The Lord God Almighty be with you all, dear babes, and keep you all in his &s;trength and power to his glory, over all the world, ye who&s;e minds are called out of it, and turned to God, to wor&s;hip the Creator and &s;erve him, and not the creature. The light of God which calls the mind out of the creatures, and turns it to him&s;elf, brings into a being of endle&s;s joy and peace. Here is always a &s;eeing God pre&s;ent, which is not known to the world, who&s;e hearts are in the creatures who&s;e knowledge is in the fle&s;h, who&s;e minds are not renewed. Therefore all friends, the &s;eed of God mind and dwell in, to reign over the unju&s;t; and the power of the Lord dwell in, to keep you clear in your under&s;tandings, that the &s;eed of God may reign in you all; the Seed of God, which is but one in all, is Chri&s;t in the male and in the female, which the promi&s;e is to. Wait upon the Lord for the ju&s;t to reign over the unju&s;t for the &s;eed of God to reign over the &s;eed of the &s;erpent, and be the head; and that all that is mortal may die: for out of that will ri&s;e pre&s;umption. So fare ye well, and God Almighty ble&s;s, guide, and keep you in his wi&s;dom.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL friends and brethren every where, now is the day of your trial, now is the time for you to be valiant, and to &s;ee that the te&s;timony of the Lord doth not fall. Now is the day for the exerci&s;e of your gifts, of your patience, and of your faith. Now is the time to be armed with patience, with the light, with righteou&s;ne&s;s, and with the helmet of &s;alvation. Now is the trial of the &s;lothful &s;ervant who hides his talent and will judge Chri&s;t hard.

Is it not the Lord &s;till that &s;uffers it? For the Lord can try you as he did Job, whom he made rich, whom he made poor, and whom he made rich again; who &s;till kept his integrity in all condi|tions. Learn Paul's le&s;&s;on, In all &s;tates to be content; and have his faith, <Q>That nothing is able to &s;eparate us from the love of God, which we have in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q> Therefore be rich in life, and in grace, which will endure, ye who are heirs of life, and born of the womb of eternity, that noble birth that cannot &s;toop to that which is born in &s;in, and conceived in iniquity; who are better bred and born, who&s;e religion is from God, above all the religions that are from below; and who walk by faith, by that which God hath given you, and not by that which men make, who walk by &s;ight, from the Ma&s;s-book to the Di|rectory. Such are &s;ubject to &s;tumble and fall, who walk by &s;ight and not by faith. Therefore mind him that de|&s;troys the original of &s;in, the devil and his works, and cuts off the entail of Satan, viz. &s;in; who would have by entail an inheritance of &s;in in men and women from gene|ration to generation, and pleads for it by all his lawyers and coun&s;ellors. For though the law, which made no|thing perfect, did not cut it off; yet Chri&s;t being come de&s;troys the devil and his works, and cuts off the entail of &s;in. This angers all the devil's lawyers and coun&s;el|lors, that Satan &s;hall not hold &s;in by entail in thy garden, in thy field, in thy temple, thy tabernacle. So keep your tabernacles, that there ye may &s;ee the glory of the Lord appear at the doors thereof. Be faithful; for ye &s;ee what the worthies and valiants of the Lord did attain unto by faith. Enoch by faith was tran&s;lated. Noah by faith was pre&s;erved over the waters in his ark. Abraham by faith for&s;ook his father's hou&s;e and religion, and all the religions of the world. I&s;aac and Jacob by faith followed his &s;teps. See how Samuel and other of the Lord's prophets, with David, by faith were pre&s;erved to God over his enemies! Daniel and the three children by faith e&s;caped the lions and the fire, and pre&s;erved their wor&s;hip clean, and by it were kept over the wor&s;hips of the world. The apo&s;tles by faith travelled up and down the world, were pre&s;erved from all the religions of the world, and beld forth the pure religion to the dark world, which they had received
<PB N="332" REF="037441_0409_100D9097D6ED2018">from God; and likewi&s;e their fellow&s;hip was received from above, which is in the go&s;pel that is everla&s;ting. In this, neither powers, principalities nor thrones, dominions nor angels, things pre&s;ent nor things to come, heights nor depths, nor death, mockings, nor &s;poiling of goods, pri&s;ons nor fetters were able to &s;eparate them from the love of God, which they had in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. And friends, "Quench not the Spirit, nor de&s;pi&s;e prophe&s;ying," where it moves; neither hinder babes and &s;ucklings from cry|ing Ho&s;annah; for out of their mouths will God ordain &s;trength. There were &s;ome in Chri&s;t's day that were again&s;t &s;uch, whom he reproved; and there were &s;ome in Mo&s;e's day, who would have &s;topped the prophets in the camp; whom Mo&s;es reproved, and &s;aid by way of en|couragement to them, <Q>Would God, that all the Lord's people were prophets!</Q> So I &s;ay now to you. There|fore ye that &s;top it in your&s;elves do not quench it in others, neither in babe nor &s;uckling; for the Lord hears the cries of the needy, and the &s;ighs and groans of the poor. Judge not that, nor the &s;ighs and groans of the Spirit, which cannot be uttered, le&s;t ye judge prayer; for prayer as well lies in &s;ighs and groans to the Lord as otherwi&s;e. Let not the &s;ons and daughters, nor the handmaids be &s;topped in their prophe&s;yings, nor the young men in their vi&s;ions, nor the old men in their dreams; but let the Lord be glorified in and through all, who is over all, God ble&s;&s;ed for ever! So every one may improve their talents, every one exerci&s;e their gifts, and every one &s;peak as the Spirit gives them utterance. Thus every one may mini&s;ter, as he hath received the grace, as a good &s;teward to him that hath given it him; &s;o all plants may bud, and "bring forth fruit" to the glory of God: <Q>for the manife&s;tation of the Spirit is given to every one to profit withal.</Q> See that every one hath profited in hea|venly things; male and female, look into your own vine|yards, &s;ee what fruit ye bear to God; look into your own hou&s;es, &s;ee how they are decked and trimmed; &s;ee what odors, myrrh, and frankincen&s;e ye have therein, and what a &s;mell and &s;avour ye have to a&s;cend to God that he may be glorified. Bring your deeds all to the light, which ye are taught to believe in by Chri&s;t, your head, the heaven|ly man: and &s;ee how they are wrought in God. Every male and female, let Chri&s;t dwell in your hearts by faith (Chri&s;t in the male and in the female;) and let your

Therefore let him reign who&s;e right it is, who was conceived by the Holy Gho&s;t; by which Holy Gho&s;t ye call him Lord in which Holy Gho&s;t ye pray, and have comfort and fellow&s;hip with the Father and with the Son.

<P>After I had tarried two fir&s;t-days at Swarthmore, and vi&s;ited meetings thereabouts, I pa&s;&s;ed into We&s;tmoreland in the &s;ame work, till I came to John Audland's, where was a general meeting. The night before I had a vi&s;ion of a <Q>de&s;perate creature that was coming to de&s;troy me, but I got victory over it.</Q> The next day in the meeting-time came one Otway, with &s;ome rude fellows. He rode round about the meeting with his &s;word or rapier, and would fain have got in through the friends to me; but the meeting being great, the friends &s;tood thick, &s;o that he could not ea&s;ily come at me. When he had rid about &s;everal times raging, and found he could not get in, being al&s;o limited by the Lord's power, he at length went away. It was a glorious meeting, ended peaceably, and the Lord's ever|la&s;ting power came over all. This wild man went home, became di&s;tracted, and not long after died. I &s;ent a paper to John Blaykling to read to him while he lay ill, &s;hewing him his wickedne&s;s; and he did acknowledge &s;omething of it.</P>
<P>From hence I went through Kendal, where a warrant had long lain to apprehend me; and the con&s;tables &s;eeing
<PB N="334" REF="037441_0411_100D909B6DC32DF0">me ran to fetch their warrant as I was riding through the town; but before they could come up with it I was pa&s;t, and &s;o e&s;caped their hands.</P>
<P>I travelled northwards, vi&s;iting meetings, till I came to Strickland-head, where I had a great meeting. Mo&s;t of the gentry of that country being gathered to an hor&s;e-race, not far from the meeting, I was moved to go and declare the truth to them; and a chief-con&s;table did al&s;o admoni&s;h them. Our meeting was quiet, the Lord was with us; and by his word and power friends were &s;ettled in the eternal truth.</P>
<P>From hence we pa&s;&s;ed into Cumberland, where we had many precious, living meetings. After we had travelled to Gil&s;land, and had a meeting there, we came to Carli&s;le, where they u&s;ed to put friends out of the town; but there came a great flood while we were there, that they could n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> put us out of the town; &s;o we had a meeting there on the fir&s;t-day. After which we pa&s;&s;ed to Abbey-holm, and had a little meeting there. This is a place where I told friends long before there would be a great people come forth to the Lord; which hath &s;ince come to pa&s;s, and a large meeting there is gathered to the Lord in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed from hence to a general meeting at Langlands in Cumberland, which was very large; for mo&s;t of the people had &s;o for&s;aken the prie&s;ts, that the &s;teeple-hou&s;es in &s;ome places &s;tood empty. And John Wilkin&s;on, a preacher, that I have often named before, who had three &s;teeple-hou&s;es, had &s;o few hearers left, that, giving over preaching in the &s;teeple-hou&s;es, he fir&s;t &s;et up a meeting in his hou&s;e, and preached there to them that were left. Afterwards he &s;et up a &s;ilent meeting (like friends) to which came a few: for mo&s;t of his hearers were come to friends. Thus he held on, till he had not pa&s;t half a dozen left; the re&s;t &s;till for&s;aking him, and coming away to friends. At la&s;t, when he had &s;o very few left, he would come to Pard&s;ey-Crag (where friends had a meeting of &s;everal hundreds of people, who were all come to &s;it under the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t's teaching) and he would walk about the meeting on the fir&s;t-days, like a man that went about the commons to look for &s;heep. During this time, I came to Pard&s;ey-Crag meeting, and he with three or four of his followers, yet left him, came to the meeting that day; and were all thoroughly convinced. After the meeting. Wilkin&s;on a&s;ked me two or three que&s;ti|ons, which I an&s;wered to his &s;atisfaction; from that time he came among&s;t friends, became an able mini&s;ter, preached the
<PB N="335" REF="037441_0412_100D909D058010D8">go&s;pel freely, and turned many to Chri&s;t's free teaching. And after he had continued many years in the free mini&s;try of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, he died in the year 1675.</P>
<P>I had for &s;ome time felt drawings on my &s;pirit to go into Scotland: and had &s;ent to colonel William O&s;born of Scotland, de&s;iring him to meet me; and he, with &s;ome others, were come out of Scotland to this meeting. After it was over (which, he &s;aid, was the mo&s;t glorious meeting that ever he &s;aw in his life) I pa&s;&s;ed with him and his com|pany into Scotland; having Robert Widders with me; a thundering man again&s;t hypocri&s;y, deceit, and the rotten|ne&s;s of the prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t night we came into Scotland, we lodged at an inn. The inn-keeper told us, an earl lived about a quar|ter of a mile off, who had a de&s;ire to &s;ee me; and had left word at his hou&s;e, that if ever I came into Scotland, he &s;hould &s;end him word. He told us, there were three draw-bridges to his hou&s;e; and that it would be nine o'clock before the third bridge was drawn. Finding we had time in the evening, we walked to his hou&s;e. He re|ceived us very lovingly; and &s;aid, He would have gone with us on our journey, but that he was before engaged to go to a funeral. After we had &s;pent &s;ome time with him we parted very friendly, and returned to our inn. Next morning we travelled on, and pa&s;&s;ing through Dumfries, came to Douglas, where we met with &s;ome friends; from thence we pa&s;&s;ed to the Heads, where we had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting in the name of Je&s;us, and felt him in the mid&s;t.</P>
<P>Leaving Heads, we went to Badcow, and had a meeting there: to which abundance of people came, and many were convinced: among&s;t whom was one called a lady. From thence we pa&s;&s;ed towards the Highlands to William O&s;|born's, where we gathered up the &s;ufferings of friends, and the principles of the Scotch prie&s;ts, which may be &s;een in a book called, "The Scotch Prie&s;ts Principles."</P>
<P>Afterwards we returned to Heads, Badcow, and Gar|&s;hore, where the &s;aid lady Margaret Hambleton was con|vinced; who afterwards went to warn O. Cromwel and Charles Fleetwood of the day of the Lord that was coming upon them.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t-day we had a great meeting, and &s;everal profe&s;|&s;ors came to it. Now the prie&s;ts had frighted the people with the doctrine of election and reprobation: telling them, <Q>That God had ordained the greate&s;t part of men and wo|men
<PB N="336" REF="037441_0413_100D909F95195E00">for hell; that, let them pray, or preach, or &s;ing, and do what they could, it was all to no purpo&s;e, if they were ordained for hell; that God had a certain number, which were elected for heaven; and let them do what they would, as David an adulterer, and Paul a per&s;ecutor, yet elected ve&s;&s;els for heaven. So the fault was not at all in the crea|ture, le&s;s or more; but God had ordained it &s;o.' I was led to open to the people the fal&s;ene&s;s and folly of their prie&s;ts doctrines, and &s;hewed them, the prie&s;ts had abu&s;|ed tho&s;e &s;criptures which they had brought and quoted to them, as in Jude, and other places. For whereas they &s;aid, "There was no fault at all in the creature;" I &s;hew|ed them, that they, whom Jude &s;peaks of, to wit, Cain, Core, and Balaam, who, he &s;ays, were ordained of old to condemnation, the fault was in them. For did not God warn Cain and Balaam, and put the que&s;tion to Cain, "If thou do&s;t well, &s;halt thou not be accepted?" And did not the Lord bring Core out of Egypt, and his company? yet did not he gain&s;ay both God and his law, and his prophet Mo&s;es? Here people might &s;ee that there was a fault in Cain, Corah, and Balaam; and &s;o there is in all that go in their ways. For if they, who are called chri&s;|tians, re&s;i&s;t the go&s;pel as Core did the law, err from the Spirit of God as Balaam did, and do evil as Cain did, is not here a fault? which fault is in them&s;elves, and is the cau&s;e of their reprobation, and not God. Doth not Chri&s;t &s;ay, "Go, preach the go&s;pel to all nations?" Which is the go&s;pel of &s;alvation. He would not have &s;ent them into all nations, to preach the doctrine of &s;alvation, if the greate&s;t part of men had been ordained for hell. Was not Chri&s;t a propitiation for the &s;ins of the whole world, for tho&s;e that became reprobates, as well as for the &s;aints? He died for all men, the ungodly as well as the godly, as the apo&s;tle bears witne&s;s, 2 Cor. v. 15. Rom. v. vi. And "he enlightens every man that cometh into the world," that through him they might all believe. And Chri&s;t bids them believe in the light: but all they that hate the light, which Chri&s;t bids all believe in, are reprobated. Again, <Q>The manife&s;tation of the Spirit of God is given to every man to profit withal;</Q> but they that vex, quench, and <Q>grieve it, are in the reprobation; and the fault is in them, as it is al&s;o in them that hate his light: The apo&s;tle &s;aith, The grace of God, which brings &s;alvation, hath appeared unto all men, teaching us, that denying ungodline&s;s and
<PB N="337" REF="037441_0414_100D90A221361EF8">worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world,</Q> Tit. ii. 11, 12. Now all tho&s;e that live ungodly, and in the lu&s;ts of the world, that turn from this grace of God into wantonne&s;s, and walk de&s;pitefully again&s;t it, and &s;o deny God, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t that bought them, the fault is in all &s;uch that turn from the grace of God into wantonne&s;s, and walk de&s;pitefully again&s;t that which would bring their &s;alvation, and &s;ave them out of the reprobation. But the prie&s;ts, it &s;eems, can &s;ee no fault in &s;uch as deny God, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t that bought them, &s;uch as deny his light, which they &s;hould believe in, and his grace, which &s;hould teach them to live godly, and which &s;hould bring them their &s;alvation. Now all that believe in the light of Chri&s;t, as he commands, are in the election; and &s;it un|der the teaching of the grace of God, which brings their &s;alvation. But &s;uch as turn from this grace into wanton|ne&s;s are in the reprobation: and &s;uch as hate the light are in the condemnation. Therefore I exhorted all to believe in the light, as Chri&s;t commands, and own the grace of God their free teacher; and it would a&s;&s;uredly bring them their &s;alvation: for it is &s;ufficient.</Q> Many other &s;criptures were opened concerning reprobation, and the eyes of the people were opened; and a &s;pring of life ro&s;e up among them.</P>
<P>The&s;e things &s;oon came to the prie&s;ts ear; for the peo|ple, that &s;at under their dark teachings, began to &s;ee light, and to come into the convenant of light. The noi&s;e was &s;pread over Scotland, among the prie&s;ts, that I was come thither; and a great cry was among&s;t them, that all would be &s;poiled; for they &s;aid, <Q>I had &s;poiled all the hone&s;t men and women in England already</Q> (&s;o according to their own account, the wor&s;t were left to them.) Upon this they gather|ed great a&s;&s;emblies of prie&s;ts together, and drew up a num|ber of cur&s;es to be read in their &s;everal &s;teeple-hou&s;es, that all the people &s;hould &s;ay Amen to. Some few I will here &s;et down; the reft may be read in the book before-mention|ed of "The Scotch Prie&s;ts Principles."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was, <Q>Cur&s;ed is he that &s;aith, Every man hath a light within him &s;ufficient to lead him to &s;alvation: and let all the people &s;ay, Amen.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;econd, <Q>Cur&s;ed is he that &s;aith, Faith is without &s;in: and let all the people &s;ay, Amen.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="037441_0415_100D90A3B3200EF8">
The third, <Q>Cur&s;ed is he that denieth the &s;abbath-day: and let all the people &s;ay, Amen.</Q></P>
<P>In this la&s;t they make the people cur&s;e them&s;elves; for on the &s;abbath-day (which is the &s;eventh day of the week, which the Jews kept by the command of God to them) they kept markets and fairs, and &s;o brought the cur&s;e upon their own heads.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, concerning the light, Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>Be|lieve in the light, that ye may become children of the light:</Q> and, <Q>he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved: he that be|lieveth &s;hall have everla&s;ting life: he that believeth pa&s;&s;es from death to life, and is grafted into Chri&s;t.</Q> <Q>And ye do well,</Q> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <Q>that ye take heed unto the light that &s;hines in the dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-&s;tar ari&s;e in your hearts.</Q> So the light is &s;uf|ficient to lead unto the day-&s;tar.</P>
<P>As concerning faith, it is the gift of God: and every gift of God is pure. The faith, which Chri&s;t is the author of, is precious, divine, and without &s;in. This is the faith which gives victory over &s;in, and acce&s;s to God; in which faith they plea&s;e God. But tho&s;e are reprobates them&s;elves con|cerning this faith, and are in their dead faith, who charge &s;in upon this faith under pain of a cur&s;e: which faith gives victory over their cur&s;e, and returns it into their own bowels.</P>
<P>There were a company of Scots near Badcow, who chal|lenged a di&s;pute with &s;ome of our Scotch friends (for with me they would not di&s;pute:) &s;o &s;ome of the Scotch friends met them at the market-place. The di&s;pute was to be concerning the &s;abbath-day, and &s;ome other of their princi|ples before-mentioned; and I having got their principles and a&s;&s;ertions, &s;hewed the friends where they might ea&s;ily be overthrown; and a Scotch friend, a &s;mith, overthrew them clearly.</P>
<P>There were two Independent churches in Scotland, in one of which many were convinced; but the pa&s;tor of the other was in a great rage again&s;t truth and friends. They had their elders, who &s;ometimes would exerci&s;e their gifts among&s;t the church members, and were &s;ometimes pretty tender: but their pa&s;tor &s;peaking &s;o much again&s;t the light, and us, the friends of Chri&s;t, he darkened his hearers; &s;o that they grew blind and dry, and lo&s;t their tenderne&s;s. He continued preaching again&s;t friends, and again&s;t the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, calling it natural; at la&s;t one day in his
<PB N="339" REF="037441_0416_100D90A56AD6BC60">preaching he cur&s;ed the light, and fell down as dead in his pulpit. The people carried him out, laid him upon a grave-&s;tone, and poured &s;trong waters into him, which fetched him to life again; and they carried him home, but he was mopi&s;h. After awhile he &s;tripped off his cloaths, put on a Scotch plaid, and went into the country among&s;t the dairy-women. When he had &s;taid there about two weeks he came home, and went into the pulpit again. Whereupon the people expected &s;ome great manife&s;tation or revelation from him; but, in&s;tead thereof, he began to tell them what entertainment he had met with; how one woman gave him &s;kimmed milk, another buttermilk, and another good milk: &s;o the people were obliged to take him out of the pulpit again, and carry him home. He that gave me this account, was Andrew Robin&s;on, one of his chief hearers, who came afterwards to be convinced, and re|ceived the truth. He &s;aid, he never heard that he reco|vered his &s;en&s;es again. By this people may &s;ee what came upon him that cur&s;ed the light, which light is the life in Chri&s;t, the word; and it may be a warning to all others that &s;peak evil again&s;t the light of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Now were the prie&s;ts in &s;uch a rage, that they po&s;ted to Edinburgh, to O. Cromwel's council there, with petitions again&s;t me. The noi&s;e was, 'That all was gone;' for &s;e|veral friends were come out of England, and &s;pread over Scotland, &s;ounding the day of the Lord, preaching the ever|la&s;ting go&s;pel of &s;alvation, and turning people to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who died for them, that they might receive his free teaching. After I had gathered the principles of the Scotch prie&s;ts, and the &s;ufferings of friends, and had &s;een friends in that part of Scotland &s;ettled, by the Lord's power, upon Chri&s;t their foundation, I went to Edinburgh, and in the way came to Linlithgow; where lodging at an inn, the inn|keeper's wife, who was blind, received the word of life, and came under the teaching of Chri&s;t Je&s;us her Saviour. At night came in abundance of &s;oldiers, and &s;ome officers, with whom we had much di&s;cour&s;e; &s;ome were rude. One of the officers &s;aid, <Q>He would obey the Turk's or Pilate's command, if they &s;hould command him to guard Chri&s;t to crucify him.</Q> So far he was from all tenderne&s;s, or &s;en&s;e of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, that he would rather crucify the Ju&s;t, than &s;uffer for or with the Ju&s;t; whereas many officers and magi&s;trates have lo&s;t their places, before they would turn again&s;t the Lord and his Ju&s;t One.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="037441_0417_100D90A80A4011B8">
When I had &s;taid awhile at Edinburgh, I went to Leith, where many officers of the army came in with their wives; and many were convinced. Edward Billing's wife was one. She brought a great deal of coral in her hand, and threw it on the table before me, to &s;ee whether I would &s;peak again&s;t it, or no, I took no notice of it, but declared the truth to her, and &s;he was reached. Many Bapti&s;ts were very rude; but the Lord's power came over them, &s;o that they went away confounded. Then there came in another &s;ort; one of whom &s;aid, <Q>He would di&s;pute with me; and, for argument's &s;ake, would deny there was a God.</Q> I told him, <Q>He might be one of tho&s;e fools that &s;aid in his heart, There is no God; but he &s;hould know him in the day of his judgment.</Q> So he went his way, and a fine precious time we had afterwards with &s;everal people of account; and the Lord's power came over all. William O&s;born was with me. Colonel Lidcot's wife, William Wel&s;h's wife, and &s;e|veral of the officers them&s;elves were convinced. Edward Billing and his wife at that time lived apart; and &s;he being reached by truth, and become loving to friends, we &s;ent for her hu&s;band, who came, and the Lord's power reached to them both; they joined together in it, and agreed to live together in love and unity, as man and wife.</P>
<P>After this we returned to Edinburgh, where many thou|&s;ands were gathered together, with abundance of prie&s;ts among them, about burning a witch; and I was moved to declare the day of the Lord among&s;t them; which when I had done, I went from thence to our meeting, whither ma|ny rude people and Bapti&s;ts came. The Bapti&s;ts began to vaunt with their logick and &s;yllogi&s;ms; but. <Q>I was moved in the Lord's power, to thre&s;h their chaffy light minds; and &s;hewed the people, that, after that fallacious way of di&s;cour&s;ing, they might make white &s;eem black, and black &s;eem white: as, that becau&s;e a cock had two legs, and each of them had two legs; therefore they were all cocks. Thus they might turn any thing into lightne&s;s and vanity; but it was not the way of Chri&s;t, or his apo&s;tles, to teach, &s;peak, or rea&s;on after that manner.</Q> Hereupon tho&s;e Bap|ti&s;ts went their way; and after they were gone, we had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting in the Lord's power, which was over all.</P>
<P>I mentioned before, that many of the Scotch prie&s;ts being greatly di&s;turbed at the &s;preading of truth, and the lo&s;s of their hearers thereby, were gone to Edinburgh to petition the council again&s;t me. When I came from the meeting to
<PB N="341" REF="037441_0418_100D90A9F1936800">the inn where I lodged, an officer belonging to the council brought me the following order:</P>
<Q><P>Thur&s;day, the 8th of October, 1657, at his Highne&s;s's Council in Scotland:</P>
<P>Ordered,</P>
<P>THAT George Fox do appear before the Council on Tue&s;day the 13th of October next, in the Forenoon.</P>
<P>E. Downing, Clerk of the Council.</P></Q>
<P>When he had delivered me the order, he a&s;ked me, 'Whether I would appear or no?' I did not tell him whe|ther I would or no; but a&s;ked him, <Q>If he had not forged the order?</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>No; it was a real order from the council, and he was &s;ent as their me&s;&s;enger with it.</Q> When the time came I appeared, and was had into a great room, where many per&s;ons came and looked at me. After awhile the door-keeper had me into the council-chamber: and as I was going, he took off my hat. I a&s;ked him, <Q>Why he did &s;o? and who was there, that I might not go in with my hat on? I told him, I had been before the Protector with my hat on.</Q> But he hung up my hat and had me in before them. When I had &s;tood awhile, and they &s;aid nothing to me, I was moved of the Lord to &s;ay, <Q>Peace be among&s;t you. Wait in the fear of God, that ye may receive his wi&s;dom from above, by which all things were made and created; that by it ye may all be ordered, and may order all things under your hands to God's glo|ry.</Q> They a&s;ked me, <Q>What was the occa&s;ion of my com|ing into that nation?</Q> I told them I came to vi&s;it the <Q>&s;eed of God, which had long lain in bondage under cor|ruption; that all in the nation, who profe&s;&s;ed the &s;crip|tures, the words of Chri&s;t, of the prophets and apo&s;tles, might come to the light, Spirit, and power, which they were in who gave them forth; that in and by the Spirit they might under&s;tand the &s;criptures, and know Chri&s;t and God aright, have fellow&s;hip with them, and one with another.</Q> They a&s;ked me, <Q>Whether I had any outward bu&s;ine&s;s there?</Q> I &s;aid, 'Nay.' Then they a&s;ked me. 'How long I intended to &s;tay in that country?' I told them, <Q>I &s;hould &s;ay little to that; my time was not to be long; yet in my freedom in the Lord I &s;tood, in the will of him that &s;ent me.</Q> Then they bid me withdraw; and 'the door-keeper took me by the hand, and led me forth.
<PB N="342" REF="037441_0419_100D90AB8725A6A0">In a little time they &s;ent for me again, and told me, <Q>I mu&s;t depart the nation of Scotland by that day &s;evennight.</Q> I a&s;ked them. <Q>Why? What had I done? What was my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that they pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch a &s;entence upon me to depart out of the nation?</Q> They told me, <Q>They would not di&s;pute with me.</Q> <Q>I de&s;ired them to hear what I had to &s;ay to them.</Q> They &s;aid, <Q>They would not hear me.</Q> I told them, <Q>Pharaoh heard Mo&s;es and Aaron, yet he was an heathen; and Herod heard John Bap|ti&s;t; and they &s;hould not be wor&s;e than the&s;e.</Q> But they cried, 'Withdraw, withdraw.' Whereupon the door-keeper took me again by the hand and led me out. I returned to my inn, and continued &s;till in Edinburgh; vi&s;iting friends there and thereabouts, and &s;trengthening them in the Lord. After a little time I wrote a letter to the council, to lay be|fore them their unchri&s;tian dealings, in bani&s;hing me, an innocent man that &s;ought their &s;alvation and eternal good.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the council of Edinburgh:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU that &s;it in council, and bring before your judg|ment-&s;eat the innocent, the ju&s;t, without &s;hewing what evil I have done, or convicting me of any breach of law; and afterwards ye bani&s;h me out of your nation, without telling me for what; though I told you, when ye a&s;ked me How long I would &s;tay in the nation?' that my time was not long (I &s;poke it innocently;) yet ye bani&s;h me. Will not all, think ye, that fear God, judge this to be wickedne&s;s? Con&s;ider, did not they &s;it in council about Stephen, when they &s;toned him to death? Did they not &s;it in council about Peter and John, when they haled them out of the temple, put them out of their council for a little &s;ea&s;on, and took coun&s;el together; and then brought them in again, threatened, and charged them to &s;peak no more in that name? Was not this to &s;top the truth from &s;preading in that time? Had not the prie&s;ts an hand in the&s;e things, with the magi&s;trates? and in ex|amining Stephen, when he was &s;toned to death? Was not the council gathered together again&s;t Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to put him to death? and had not the chief prie&s;ts an hand in it? When they per&s;ecute the ju&s;t, and crucify the ju&s;t, do they not then neglect judgment, mercy, and ju&s;tice, and the weighty matters of the law, which are ju&s;t? Was not the apo&s;tle Paul to&s;&s;ed up and down and impri|&s;oned
<PB N="343" REF="037441_0420_100D90AD18DFDBE0">by the prie&s;ts and the rulers? Was not John Bap|ti&s;t ca&s;t into pri&s;on? Are not ye doing the &s;ame work, &s;hewing what &s;pirit ye are of? Now, do not ye &s;hew the end of your profe&s;&s;ion, the end of your prayers, the end of your religion, and the end of your teaching, who are now come to bani&s;h the truth, and him that came to declare it unto you? Doth not this &s;hew that ye are but in the words, out of the life of the prophets, Chri&s;t, and his apo&s;tles? for they did not u&s;e &s;uch practice, as to bani&s;h any. How do ye receive &s;trangers, which is a command of God among the prophets, Chri&s;t, and the apo&s;tles? Some by that means have entertained angels at unawares; but ye bani&s;h one that comes to vi&s;it the &s;eed of God, and is not chargeable to any of you. Will not all that fear God look upon this to be &s;pite and wickedne&s;s again&s;t the truth? How are ye like to love enemies, that bani&s;h your friend? How are ye like to do good to them that hate you, when ye do evil to them that love you? How are ye like to heap coals of fire on their heads that hate you. and to overcome evil with good, when ye bani&s;h thus? Do ye not manife&s;t to all that are in the truth that ye have not the chri&s;tian &s;pirit? How did ye do ju&s;tice to me, when ye could not convict me of any evil, yet bani&s;h me? This &s;hews that truth is bani&s;hed out of your hearts, and ye have taken part again&s;t the truth with evil-doers, with the wicked envious prie&s;ts, &s;toners, &s;trikers, and mockers in the &s;treets; with the&s;e, ye that bani&s;h have taken part; whereas ye &s;hould have been a terror to the&s;e, and a prai&s;e to them that do well, and &s;uccourers of them that are in the truth; then might ye have been a ble&s;&s;ing to the na|tion, and not have bani&s;hed him that was moved of the Lord to vi&s;it the &s;eed of God, and thereby have brought your names upon record, and made them &s;tink in ages to come, among them that fear God. Were not the magi&s;|trates &s;tirred up in former ages to per&s;ecute or bani&s;h, by the corrupt prie&s;ts? and did not the corrupt prie&s;ts &s;tir up the rude multitude again&s;t the ju&s;t in other ages? There|fore are your &s;treets like Sodom and Gomorrah. Did not the Jews and the prie&s;ts make the Gentiles minds en|vious again&s;t the apo&s;tles? Who were they that would not have the prophet Amos to prophe&s;y at the king's chapel; but bad him fly his way?

<P>When this was delivered, and read among&s;t them, &s;ome of them, I heard, were troubled at what they had done; being made &s;en&s;ible that they would not be &s;o &s;erved them|&s;elves. But it was not long before they that bani&s;hed me were bani&s;hed them&s;elves, or glad to get away; who would not do good in the day when they had power, nor &s;uffer others that would.</P>
<P>After I had &s;pent &s;ome time among friends at Edinburgh, and thereabouts, I pa&s;&s;ed from thence to Heads again, where friends had been in great &s;ufferings; for the Pre&s;byterian prie&s;ts had excommunicated them, and given charge, that none &s;hould buy or &s;ell with them, nor eat nor drink with them. So they could neither &s;ell their commodities, nor buy what they wanted; which made it go very hard with &s;ome of them; for if they had bought bread or other vic|tuals of any of their neighbours, the prie&s;ts threatened them &s;o with cur&s;es, that they would run and fetch it from them again. But colonel A&s;hfield, being a ju&s;tice of peace in that country, put a &s;top to the prie&s;ts proceedings. This colonel A&s;hfield was afterwards convinced him&s;elf, had a meeting &s;ettled at his hou&s;e, and declared the truth, and lived and died in it.</P>
<P>After I had vi&s;ited friends at and about Heads, and en|couraged them in the Lord, I went to Gla&s;gow, where a meeting was appointed; but not one of the town came to it. As I went into the city, the guard at the gates took me before the governor, who was a moderate man. A great deal of di&s;cour&s;e I had with him; but he was too light to receive the truth; yet he &s;et me at liberty: &s;o I pa&s;&s;ed to the meeting. But &s;eeing none of the town's people came to the meeting, we declared truth through the town; then pa&s;&s;ed away, vi&s;ited friends meetings thereabouts, and re|turned towards Badcow. Several friends declared truth in their &s;teeple-hou&s;es, and the Lord's power was with them.
<PB N="345" REF="037441_0422_100D90B1B99E9088">One time, as I was going with William O&s;born to his hou&s;e, there lay a company of rude fellows by the way-&s;ide, who had hid them&s;elves under the hedges and in bu&s;hes. I e&s;pying them, a&s;ked him, 'What they were?' 'Oh!' &s;aid he, 'they are thieves.' Robert Widders, being moved to go to &s;peak to a prie&s;t, was left behind, intending to come af|ter; &s;o I &s;aid to William O&s;born, <Q>I will &s;tay here in this valley, and do thou go look after Robert Widders.</Q> But he was unwilling to go, being afraid to leave me there alone becau&s;e of tho&s;e fellows; till I told him, <Q>I feared them not.</Q> Then I called to them, a&s;king them, What they lay lurking there for? I bid them come up to me; but they were loth to come. I charged them to come up to me, or el&s;e it might be wor&s;e with them. Then they came trem|bling to me; for the dread of the Lord had &s;truck them. I admoni&s;hed them to be hone&s;t, and directed them to the light of Chri&s;t in their hearts, that by it they might &s;ee what an evil it was to follow after theft and robbery; and the power of the Lord came over them. I &s;taid there till William O&s;born and Robert Widders came, and then we pa&s;&s;ed on together. But it is likely, if we two had gone before, they would have robbed Widders when he had come after alone, there being three or four of them.</P>
<P>We went to William O&s;born's, where we had a good opportunity to declare the truth to &s;everal people that came in. Then we went among the Highlanders, who were &s;o devili&s;h they had like to have &s;poiled us and our hor&s;es; for they ran at us with pitchforks; but through the Lord's goodne&s;s we e&s;caped them, being pre&s;erved by his power.</P>
<P>From thence we pa&s;&s;ed to Stirling, where the &s;oldiers took us up, and had us to the main-guard. After a few words with their officers, the Lord's power coming over them, we were &s;et at liberty; but no meeting could we get among&s;t them in the town, they were &s;o clo&s;ed up in dark|ne&s;s. Next morning there came a man with an hor&s;e that was to run a race, and mo&s;t of the town's people and the officers went to &s;ee it. As they returned from the race, I had a brave opportunity to declare the day of the Lord and his word of life among&s;t them. Some confe&s;&s;ed to it, and &s;ome oppo&s;ed; but the Lord's truth and power came over them all.</P>
<P>Leaving Stirling we came to Burnt-I&s;land, where I had two meetings at Captain Pool's; one in the morning, the other in the afternoon. Whil&s;t they went to dinner I walk|ed
<PB N="346" REF="037441_0423_100D90B34E61EA50">to the &s;ea-&s;ide, not having freedom to eat with them. Both he and his wife were convinced, and became good friends afterward; and &s;everal officers of the army came in and received the truth.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed from thence through &s;everal other places in that country, till we came to John&s;tons; where were &s;e|veral Bapti&s;ts, that were very bitter, and came in a rage to di&s;pute with us. Vain janglers and di&s;puters indeed they were. When they could not prevail by di&s;puting, they went and informed the governor again&s;t us, and next morn|ing they rai&s;ed a whole company of foot, and bani&s;hed me, Alexander Parker, James Lanca&s;ter, and Robert Widders out of the town. As they guarded us through the town, James Lanca&s;ter was moved to &s;ing with a melodious &s;ound in the power of God, and I was moved to proclaim the day of the Lord, and preach the everla&s;ting go&s;pel to the peo|ple. For the people generally came forth, &s;o that the &s;itreets were filled with them; and the &s;oldiers were &s;o a&s;hamed, that they &s;aid, <Q>They had rather have gone to Jamaica than have guarded us &s;o.</Q> But we were put into a boat with our hor&s;es, carried over the water, and there left. The Bapti&s;ts, who were the cau&s;e of our being thus put out of this town, were them&s;elves, not long after, turned out of the army: and he that was then governor was di&s;|carded al&s;o when the king came in.</P>
<P>Being thus thru&s;t out of John&s;tons we went to another market-town, where Edward Billing and many &s;oldiers quartered. We went to an inn, and de&s;ired to have a meet|ing in the town, that we might preach the everla&s;ting go&s;pel among&s;t them. The officers and &s;oldiers &s;aid, <Q>We &s;hould have it in the town-hall;</Q> but the Scotch magi&s;trates in &s;pite appointed a meeting there that day for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the town. Which when the officers of the &s;oldiery under|&s;tood, and perceived that it was done in malice, they would have had us to have gone into the twon-hall neverthele&s;s. But we told them, 'No, by no means;' for then the magi&s;|trates might inform the governor again&s;t them, and &s;ay, <Q>They took the town-hall from them by force, when they were to do their town-bu&s;ine&s;s therein.</Q> We told them. 'We would go to the market-place.' They &s;aid. <Q>It was market-day.</Q> We replied, <Q>It was &s;o much the better; for we would have all people to hear the truth and know our principles.</Q> Alexander Parker went and &s;tood upon the market-cro&s;s, with a bible in his hand, and declared the
<PB N="347" REF="037441_0424_100D90B5368A9DB0">truth among&s;t the &s;oldiers and market-people: but the Scots, being a dark, carnal people, gave little heed, nor hardly took notice what was &s;aid. After awhile I was mo|ved of the Lord to &s;tand up at the cro&s;s, and to declare with a loud voice the everla&s;ting truth, and the day of the Lord that was coming upon all &s;in and wickedne&s;s. Where-upon the people came running out of the town-hall, and gathered &s;o together that at la&s;t we had a large meeting; for they only &s;ate in the court for a colour to hinder us from having the hall to meet in. When the people were come away, the magi&s;trates followed them. Some walked by, but &s;ome &s;taid and heard; and the Lord's power came over all and kept all quiet. <Q>The people were turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who died for them, and had en|lightened them, that with his light they might &s;ee their evil deeds, be &s;aved from their &s;ins by him, and might come to know him to be their teacher. But if they would not receive Chri&s;t, and own him, it was told them, that this light which came from him would be their condemna|tion</Q></P>
<P>Several of them were made loving to us, e&s;pecially the Engli&s;h, and &s;ome came afterwards to be convinced. But there was a &s;oldier that was very envious again&s;t us; he hat|ed both us and the truth, &s;poke evil of the truth, and very de&s;puefully again&s;t the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which we bore te&s;timony to. Mighty zealous he was for the prie&s;ts and their hearers. As this man was holding his hat before his &s;ace, while the prie&s;t prayed; one of the prie&s;t's hearers &s;tabbed him to death. So he, who had rejected the teach|ings of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and cried down the &s;ervants of the Lord, was murdered among&s;t them whom he had &s;o cried up, and by one of them.</P>
<P>We travelled from this town to Leith, warning and ex|horting people as we went, to turn to the Lord. At Leith the innkeeper told me, the council had granted warrants to apprehend me, <Q>becau&s;e I was not gone out of the nation after the &s;even days were expired that they had ordered me to depart the nation in</Q> Several friendly people al&s;o came and told me the &s;ame. To whom I &s;aid; <Q>What do ye tell me of their warrants again&s;t me? If there were a cart load of them I do not regard them; for the Lord's power is over them all.</Q></P>
<P>I went from Leith to Edinburgh again, where they &s;aid the warrants from the council were out again&s;t me. I went
<PB N="348" REF="037441_0425_100D90B7862E0800">to the inn where I had lodged before, and no man offered to meddle with me. After I had vi&s;ited friends in the city, I de&s;ired tho&s;e that travelled with me to get ready their hor&s;es in the morning; and we rode out of town together. There were with the me Thomas Rawlin&s;on, Alexander Parker, and Robert Widders. When we were come out of the town, they a&s;ked me, 'Whither I would go?' I told them, <Q>It was upon me from the Lord to go back again to John&s;tons (the town out of which we had been lately thru&s;t) and to &s;et the power of God and his truth over them al&s;o.</Q> Alexan|der Parker &s;aid, 'He would go along with me;' and I wi&s;h|ed the other two to &s;tay at a town about three miles from Edinburgh till we returned. Then Alexander Parker and I got over the water, which was about three miles over, and rode through the country; but in the afternoon, his hor&s;e being weak and not able to hold up with mine, I put on and got into John&s;tons ju&s;t as they were drawing up the bridges, the officers and &s;oldiers never que&s;tioning me. I rode up the &s;treet to captain Davenport's, from whence we had been bani&s;hed. There were many officers with him: and when I came among&s;t them they lifted up their hands, admiring that I &s;hould come again; but I told them, <Q>The Lord God had &s;ent me among&s;t them again.</Q> They went their way; and the Bapti&s;ts &s;ent me a letter, by way of chal|lenge, 'That they would di&s;cour&s;e with me the next day.' I &s;ent them word, <Q>I would meet them at &s;uch a hou&s;e, about half a mile out of the town, at &s;uch an hour.</Q> For I con&s;idered, if I &s;hould &s;tay in town to di&s;cour&s;e with them, they might, under pretence of di&s;cour&s;ing with me, have rai&s;ed men to put me out of town again, as they had done before. At the time appointed I went to the place, captain Davenport and his &s;on accompanying me; where I &s;taid &s;ome hours, but not one of them came. While I &s;taid waiting for them, I e&s;pied Alexander Parker coming; who not being able to reach the town, had lain out the night before; and I was exceeding glad that we were met again.</P>
<P>Captain Davenport was then loving to friends; but af|terwards coming more into obedience to truth, he was turn|ed out of his place, for not putting off his hat, and for &s;ay-Thou and Thee to them.</P>
<P>When we had waited beyond rea&s;onable ground to expect any of their coming we departed; and Alexander Parker being moved to go again to the town where we had the meet|ing at the market-cro&s;s, I pa&s;&s;ed alone to licutenant Fo&s;|ter's
<PB N="349" REF="037441_0426_100D90B96EC49090">quarters, where I found &s;everal officers that were con|vinced. From thence I went to the town where I had left the other two friends, and they and I went back to Edin|burgh together.</P>
<P>When we were come to the city, I bid Robert Widders follow me; and in the dread and power of the Lord we came up to the two fir&s;t centries, and the Lord's power came &s;o over them, that we pa&s;&s;ed by them without any examina|tion. Then we rode up the &s;treet to the market-place, and by the main-guard out at the gate by the third centry, and &s;o clear out at the &s;uburbs, and there came to an inn and &s;et up our hor&s;es, it being &s;eventh-day. Now I &s;aw and felt that we had rode, as it were, again&s;t the cannon's mouth or the &s;word's point; but the Lord's power and im|mediate hand carried us over the heads of them all. Next day I went to the meeting in the city, friends having notice I would attend it. There came many officers and &s;oldiers to it, and a glorious meeting it was; the everla&s;ting power of God was &s;et over the nation, and his Son reigned in his glorious power. All was quiet, and no man offered to meddle with me. When the meeting was ended, and I had vi&s;ited friends, I came out of the city to my inn again. The next day, being &s;econd-day, we &s;et forward towards the borders of England.</P>
<P>As we travelled along the country I e&s;pied a &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and it &s;truck at my life. I a&s;ked, what &s;teeple-hou&s;e it was? and was an&s;wered, it was Dunbar. When I came thither, and had &s;et up at an inn, I walked to the &s;teeple|hou&s;e, having a friend or two with me. When we came to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e yard, one of the chief men of the town was walking there. I &s;poke to one of the friends that was with me, <Q>To go to him, and tell him, that about the ninth hour next morning there would be a meeting there of the people of God called Quakers; of which we de&s;ired he would give notice to the people of the town.</Q> He &s;ent me word, <Q>That they were to have a lecture there by the ninth hour; but that we might have our meeting there by the eighth hour if we would.</Q> We concluded &s;o, and de&s;ired him to give notice of it. Accordingly in the morning both poor and rich came; and there being a captain of hor&s;e quartered in the town, he and his troopers came al&s;o, &s;o that we had a large concour&s;e: and a glorious meeting it was, the Lord's power being over all. After &s;ome time the prie&s;t came, and went into the &s;teeple-hou&s;e; but we being in the yard,
<PB N="350" REF="037441_0427_100D90BB03DCCCD0">mo&s;t of the people &s;taid with us. Friends were &s;o full, and their voices &s;o high in the power of God, that the prie&s;t could do little in the hou&s;e, but came quickly out again, &s;tood awhile, and then went his way. I opened to the people, <Q>Where they might find Chri&s;t Je&s;us, turned them to the light, which he had enlightened them withal, that in the light they might &s;ee Chri&s;t who died for them, turn to him, and know him to be their Saviour and teacher; let them &s;ee, that the teachers they had hitherto followed were hirelings, who made the go&s;pel chargeable; &s;hewed them the wrong ways they had walked in, in the night of apo&s;tacy, directed them to Chri&s;t, the new and living way to God; manife&s;ted unto them, how they had lo&s;t the re|ligion and wor&s;hip which Chri&s;t &s;et up in &s;pirit and truth, and had hitherto been in the religions and wor&s;hips of men's making and &s;etting up; and after I had turned the people to the Spirit of God, which led the holy men of God to give forth the &s;criptures, and &s;hewed them that they mu&s;t al&s;o come to receive and be led by the &s;ame Spirit in them&s;elves (a mea&s;ure of which was given unto every one of them) if ever they came to know God and Chri&s;t and the &s;criptures aright, perceiving the other friends to be full of power and the word of the Lord, I &s;tepped down, giving way for them to declare what they had from the Lord to the people.</Q> Towards the latter end of the meeting &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors began to jangle; whereupon I &s;tood up again and an&s;wered their que&s;tions, &s;o that they &s;eemed to be &s;atisfied and our meeting ended in the Lord's power, quiet and peaceable. This was the la&s;t meeting I had in Scotland. The truth and the power of God was &s;et over that nation, and many, by the power and Spirit of God were turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their Saviour and Teacher, who&s;e blood was &s;hed for them; and there is &s;ince a great increa&s;e, and great there will be in Scotland, tho' the time may be far di&s;tant at pre&s;ent. For when fir&s;t I &s;et my hor&s;e's feet upon Scotti&s;h ground, I felt the &s;eed of God to &s;parkle about me, like innumerable &s;parks of fire. Not but that there is abundance of thick, cloddy earth of hy|pocri&s;y and &s;al&s;ene&s;s atop, and a briery, brambly nature, which is to be burned up with God's word, and plowed up with his &s;piritual plough, before God's &s;eed brings forth heavenly and &s;piritual fruit to his glory. But the hu&s;band|man is to wait in patience.</P>
<P>From Dunbar we came to Berwick, where we were que&s;|tioned
<PB N="351" REF="037441_0428_100D90BCEC258F38">a little by the officers; but the governor was loving towards us, and in the evening we had a little meeting, in which the power of the Lord was manife&s;ted over all.</P>
<P>Leaving Berwick we came to Morpeth, and through the country, vi&s;iting friends, to Newca&s;tle, where I had been once before. The Newca&s;tle prie&s;ts wrote many books again&s;t us, and one Ledger, an alderman of the town, was very envious again&s;t truth and friends. He and the prie&s;ts had &s;aid, <Q>The Quakers would not come into any great towns, but lived in the fells like butterflies.</Q> I took An|thony Pear&s;on with me, and went to this Ledger and &s;eve|ral others of the aldermen; <Q>de&s;iring to have a meeting among&s;t them, &s;eeing they had written &s;o many books again&s;t us: for we were now come, I told them, into their great town.</Q> But they would not yield we &s;hould have a meeting, neither would they be &s;poke with, &s;ave only this Ledger and one other. I queried, <Q>Had they not called friends butterflies, and &s;aid, We would not come into any great towns? And now we were in their town, they would not come at us, tho they had printed books again&s;t us: who are the butterflies now?</Q> Then Ledger began to plead <Q>for the &s;abbath-day. I told him, They kept markets and fairs on that which was the &s;abbath-day, for that was the &s;eventh day of the week; whereas that day which the pro|fe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians now meet, on, and call their &s;abbath, is the fir&s;t day of the week.</Q> As we could not have a pub|lick meeting among them, we got a little meeting among friends and friendly people at the Gate-&s;ide; where a meet|ing is continued to this day in the name of Je&s;us. As I was pa&s;&s;ing by the market-place the power of the Lord ro&s;e in me <Q>to warn them of the day of the Lord that was com|ing upon them.</Q> And not long after, all tho&s;e prie&s;ts of Newca&s;tle and their profe&s;&s;ion were turned out when the king came in.</P>
<P>From Newca&s;tle we travelled, having meetings and vi&s;it|ing friends, in Northumberland and Bi&s;hoprick. A very good meeting we had at lieutenant Dove's, where many were turned to the Lord and his teaching. After which I went to vi&s;it a ju&s;tice of peace, a very &s;ober, loving man, who confe&s;&s;ed to the truth.</P>
<P>From thence we came to Durham, where was a man come from London to &s;et up a college to make mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, as they &s;aid. I went with &s;ome others to rea&s;on with the man, and to let him &s;ee, <Q>That to teach men He|brew,
<PB N="352" REF="037441_0429_100D90BF46081528">Greek, Latin, and the &s;even arts, which were all but the teachings of the natural man, was not the way to make them mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. For the languages began at Babel; and to the Greeks, that &s;poke Greek as their mother-tongue, the preaching of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t was &s;ooli&s;hne&s;s; and to the Jews, that &s;poke Hebrew as their mother-tongue, Chri&s;t was a &s;tumbling-block. The Ro|mans, who had the Latin, per&s;ecuted the Chri&s;tians; and Pilate, one of the Roman governors, &s;et Hebrew, Greek, and Latin atop of Chri&s;t when he crucified him. So he might &s;ee the many languages began at Babel, and they &s;et them atop of Chri&s;t, the Word, when they crucified him. John the divine, who preached the Word which was in the beginning, &s;aid, <Q>That the bea&s;t and the whore have power over tongues and languages, and they are as wa|ters.</Q> Thus, I told him, he might &s;ee the whore and the bea&s;t have power over the tongues and the many languages, which are in my&s;tery Babylon; for they began at Babel, and the per&s;ecutors of Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;et them over him, when he was crucified by them; but he is ri&s;en over them all, who was before them all. Now (&s;aid I to this man) do&s;t thou think to make mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t by the&s;e na|tural, confu&s;ed languages which &s;prung from Babel, are admired in Babylon, and &s;et atop of Chri&s;t, the Life, by a per&s;ecutor? Oh, no!</Q> The man confe&s;&s;ed to many of the&s;e things. Then we &s;hewed him further, <Q>That Chri&s;t made his mini&s;ters him&s;elf, gave gifts unto them, and bid them <Q>Pray to the Lord of the Harve&s;t to &s;end forth labourers.</Q> And Peter and John, though unlearned and ignorant as to &s;chool-learning, preached Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Word, which was in the beginning, before Babel was. Paul al&s;o was made an apo&s;tle, not of man, nor by man, neither received he the go&s;pel from man, but from Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who is the &s;ame now, and &s;o is the go&s;pel, as it was at that day.</Q> When we had thus di&s;cour&s;ed with him, he became very loving and tender: and after he had con&s;idered further of it, declined to &s;et up his college.</P>
<P>From Durham we went to Anthony Pear&s;on's, from thence into Cleveland, and pa&s;&s;ed through York&s;hire to the further and of Holderne&s;s, and had mighty meetings, the Lord's power accompanying us.</P>
<P>After we pa&s;&s;ed from. Anthony Pear&s;on's, we went by Hu&s;t and Pom&s;ret to George Watkin&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings in the&s;e parts, till we came to Scale hou&s;e,
<PB N="353" REF="037441_0430_100D90C12CB4B7A8">and &s;o, to Swarthmore; the everla&s;ting power and arm of God carrying us through and pre&s;erving us. After I had vi&s;ited friends there-away, I pa&s;&s;ed into York&s;hire and Che&s;hire, and &s;o through other counties into Derby&s;hire and Nottingham&s;hire; and glorious meetings we had, the Lord's pre&s;ence being with us.</P>
<P>At Nottingham I &s;ent to Rice Jones, de&s;iring him <Q>to acquaint his people that I had &s;omething to &s;ay to them from the Lord.</Q> He came and told me, <Q>Many of them lived in the country, and he could not tell how to &s;end to them.</Q> I told him, <Q>He might acquaint them about the town of it, and &s;end to as many in the country as he could.</Q> The next day we met at the ca&s;tle, there being about four&s;core people, to whom I declared the truth for about the &s;pace of two hours; and the Lord's power was over them all, &s;o that they had not power to open their mouths in oppo&s;ition. When I had done, one of them a&s;ked me a que&s;tion, which I was loth to have an&s;wered; for I &s;aw it might lead into jangling, and was unwilling to go into jangling, for &s;ome of the people were tender; yet I could not well tell how to e&s;cape it. Wherefore I an|&s;wered the que&s;tion, and was moved forthwith to &s;peak to Rice Jones, and lay before him, <Q>That he had been the man who had &s;cattered &s;uch as had been tender, and &s;ome that had been convinced and had been led out of the va|nities of the world, which he had formerly judged; but now he judged the power of God in them, and they being &s;imple turned to him; &s;o he and they were turned to be vainer than the world: for many of his followers were become the greate&s;t foot-ball players and wre&s;tlers in the whole country. I told them it was the &s;erpent in him that had &s;cattered and done hurt to &s;uch as were tender towards the Lord. Neverthele&s;s, if he waited in the fear of God for the &s;eed of the woman, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head in him, that had &s;cattered and done the hurt; he might come to gather them again by this heaven|ly &s;eed; though it would be an hard work for him, to ga|ther them again out of tho&s;e vanities he had led them into.</Q> At this Rice Jones &s;aid, <Q>Thou lie&s;t, it is not the &s;eed of the woman that brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head.</Q> 'No! &s;aid I, 'what is it then? "I &s;ay, it is the law," &s;aid he. 'But '&s;aid I, the &s;cripture, &s;peaking of the &s;eed of the woman, &s;aith. "It &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> brui&s;e his "heel" now, hath the law an heel, &s;aid I, to be brui&s;ed?'
<PB N="354" REF="037441_0431_100D90C2BB95E418">Then Rice Jones and all his company were at a &s;tand, and I was moved in the power of the Lord to &s;ay, <Q>This &s;eed, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the &s;eed of the woman, which &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head, &s;hall brur&s;e thy head, and break you all in pieces.</Q> Thus I left on the heads of them the &s;eed, Chri&s;t; and not long after he and his company &s;cattered to pieces; &s;everal of whom came to be friends, and &s;tand to this day. Many of them had been convinced about eight years before, but had been led a&s;ide by this Rice Jones: for they denied the inward cro&s;s, the power of God, and &s;o went into vanity. It was about eight years, &s;ince I had been formerly among&s;t them; in which time I was to pa&s;s over them, and by them, &s;eeing they had &s;lighted the Lord's truth and power, and the vi&s;itation of his love unto them. But now was the time that I was moved to go to them again, and it was of great-&s;ervice; for many of them were brought to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and were &s;ettled upon him, &s;itting down under his teaching and feeding, where they were kept fre&s;h and green; and the others that would not be gathered to him &s;oon after withered. This was that Rice Jones, who had &s;ome years before &s;aid, <Q>I was then at the highe&s;t, and &s;hould fall;</Q> but, poor man: he little thought how near his own fall was.</P>
<P>We left Nottingham, and went into Warwick&s;hire, Northampton&s;hire, and Leice&s;ter&s;hire, vi&s;iting friends, and having meetings as we travelled. We came into Bedford|&s;hire, where we had large gatherings in the name of Je&s;us. After &s;ome time we came to John Crook's, where a general yearly meeting for the whole nation was appointed to be held. This meeting la&s;ted three days, and many friends from mo&s;t parts of the nation came to it; &s;o that the inns and towns round thereabouts were filled, for many thou|&s;ands of people were at it. And although there was &s;ome di&s;turbance by &s;ome rude people that had run out from truth; yet the Lord's power came over all, and a glorious meeting it was. The everla&s;ting go&s;pel was preached, and many received it, which go&s;pel brought life and immortality to light in them, and &s;hined over all.</P>
<P>I was moved by the Power and Spirit of the Lord to open unto them the <Q>promi&s;e of God, that it was made to the &s;eed, not to &s;eeds, as many, but to one; which &s;eed was Chri&s;t: and that all people, both male and female, &s;hould feel this &s;eed in them, which was heir of the pro|mi&s;e, that &s;o they might all witne&s;s Chri&s;t in them, the
<PB N="355" REF="037441_0432_100D90C450E05BB8">hope of glory, the my&s;tery which had been hid from ages and generations, which was revealed to the apo&s;tles, and is revealed again now, after the long night of apo&s;tacy. So that all might come up into this &s;eed, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, walk in it, and &s;it down together in heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who was the foundation of the prophets and apo&s;|tles, the rock of ages, and is our foundation now. All &s;itting down in him, &s;it down in the &s;ub&s;tance, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t, that changes not, the &s;eed that brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head, which was before he was, who ends all the types, figures, and &s;hadows, and is the &s;ub&s;tance of them all; in whom there is no &s;hadow.</Q> Now, the&s;e things were upon me to open unto all, that they might mind and &s;ee what it is they &s;it down in.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They that &s;it down in Adam in the fall, &s;it down in mi&s;ery, in death, in darkne&s;s and corruption.</P>
<P>Secondly, They that &s;it down in the types, figures, and &s;hadows, and under the fir&s;t prie&s;thood, law, and covenant, &s;it down in that which mu&s;t have an end, and which made nothing perfect.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They that &s;it down in the apo&s;tacy, that hath got up &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, &s;it down in &s;piritual Sodom and Egypt; and are drinking of the whore's cup, under the bea&s;t's and dragon's power.</P>
<P>Fourthly, They that &s;it down in the &s;tate in which Adam was before he fell, &s;it down in that which may be &s;allen from; for he fell from that &s;tate, though it was perfect.</P>
<P>Fifthly, They that &s;it down in the prophets, &s;it down in that which mu&s;t be fulfilled: and they that &s;it down in the fellow&s;hip of water, bread, and wine, the&s;e being tem|poral things, they &s;it down in that which is &s;hort of Chri&s;t, and of his bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Sixthly, To &s;it down in a profe&s;&s;ion of all the &s;criptures, from Gene&s;is to the Revelations, and not be in the pow|er and Spirit which tho&s;e were in that gave them forth; that was to be turned away from, by them that came into the power and Spirit which tho&s;e were in that gave forth the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Seventhly, They that &s;it down in the heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;it down in him that never fell, nor ever changed. Here is the &s;afe &s;itting for all his elect, his church, his &s;piritual members, of which he is the living head, his living &s;tones, the hou&s;ehold of faith; of which
<PB N="356" REF="037441_0433_100D90C6A1804758">hou&s;e he is the corner-&s;tone, that &s;tands and abides all weathers. "For", as the apo&s;tle &s;aid, <Q>he hath quick|ened us, who were dead in &s;ins and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, &amp;c. and made us &s;it together in the heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; that in the ages to come he might &s;hew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindne&s;s towards us, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> Now the ages are come, that his kindne&s;s and exceeding riches towards us through Je&s;us Chri&s;t is truly manife&s;ted in us, as it was in the apo&s;tles days; even in us, who have been dead in &s;ins and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as they were; but now are quickened, and made to &s;it together in the hea|venty places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t, by whom all things were created; who is a&s;cended above all, and is over all, and who&s;e glorious pre&s;ence is now known. All that &s;it down here, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;ee where all other people &s;it, and in what. The promi&s;e of God being to the &s;eed, which is one, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, every man and woman mu&s;t come to witne&s;s this &s;eed, Chri&s;t in them, that they may be heirs of the promi&s;e; and inheriting that, they will inherit &s;ub&s;tance. The&s;e things were largely declared of; the &s;tate of the church, and the &s;tate of the fal&s;e church &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, opened; and how the true church fled into the wilderne&s;s: and the &s;tate of the fal&s;e prophets, which Chri&s;t &s;aid &s;hould come, and John &s;aw were come, and how all the world wondered after them; and how they had filled the world with fal&s;e doctrines, ways, wor&s;hips, and religions: and how the everla&s;ting go&s;pel is now preached again to all nations, kindreds, tongues and peo|ple; for all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people had drunk the whore's cup, and &s;he was over them, and &s;at up|on them. In this night of apo&s;tacy the pure religion and wor&s;hip in &s;pirit, which was in the apo&s;tles days, the way of life and living faith, and the power and Holy Gho&s;t were lo&s;t; but now they came to be &s;et up again by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, his me&s;&s;engers and mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, as in the apo&s;tles days. For as Chri&s;t &s;ent his di&s;ciples to go and preach the go&s;pel into all the world, and after that, the fal&s;e prophets and antichri&s;ts went over the world, and preach|ed their fal&s;e doctrines and traditions, and heatheni&s;h and Jewi&s;h rudiments, &s;o now again the everla&s;ting go&s;pel mu&s;t be preached to all nations, and to every creature, that they may come into the pure religion, to wor&s;hip God in the Spirit and truth, and may know Chri&s;t Je&s;us, their way to God, to be the author of their faith, and may re|ceive
<PB N="357" REF="037441_0434_100D90C90A4C2778">the go&s;pel from heaven, and not from men; in which go&s;pel, received from heaven, is the heavenly fellow&s;hip, which is a my&s;tery to all the fellow&s;hips in the world.' After the&s;e things had been largely opened, with many others concerning Chri&s;t Je&s;us and his kingdom, and the people were turned to the divine light of Chri&s;t and his Spirit, by which they might come to know God and Chri&s;t, and the &s;criptures, and to have fellow&s;hip with them, and one with another in the &s;ame Spirit, I was moved to de|clare and open divers other things to tho&s;e friends who had received a part of the mini&s;try, concerning the exerci&s;e of their &s;piritual gifts in the church: which, being taken in writing by one pre&s;ent, was after this manner;</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TAKE heed of de&s;troying that which ye have begot|ten: for that which de&s;troys, goes out, and is the ca&s;t-away. And though that be true, yea, and may be the pure truth which &s;uch an one &s;peaks, yet if he doth not remain in that, and live in that in his particular, but goes out, the &s;ame which he is gone out from cometh over him. So that which calms and cools the &s;pirits, goes over the world, and brings to the Father, to inherit the life eternal; and reaches to the &s;pirits in pri&s;on in all. Therefore in the living, immovable Word of the Lord God dwell, in the renown thereof: and remain on the foundation that is pure, and that is &s;ure: for who&s;oever goes out from the pure, and mini&s;ters not in and from that, he comes to an end, and doth not remain; although he may have had a time, and may have been &s;erviceable for a time, while he lived in the thing.</P>
<P>Take heed of many words; what reacheth to the life, &s;ettles in the life. That which cometh from the life, and is received from God, reacheth to the life, and &s;ettles others in the life: the work is not now as it was at fir&s;t; the work now is, to &s;ettle and &s;tay in the life. For as friends have been led to mini&s;ter in the power, and the power hath gone through, &s;o that there hath grown an under|&s;tanding among both people of the world and friends, &s;o friends mu&s;t be kept in the life which is pure, that with that they may an&s;wer the pure life of God in others. If friends do not live in the pure life which they &s;peak of, to an&s;wer the life in tho&s;e they &s;peak to, the other part &s;teps in; and &s;o there comes up an outward acquaintance,
<PB N="358" REF="037441_0435_100D90CA9DC56620">and he lets that come over him. But as every one is kept living in the life of God, over all that which is con|trary, they are in their places; then they do not lay hands on any &s;uddenly, which is the danger now: for if any one do, he may lo&s;e his di&s;cerning, may lay hands on the wrong part, &s;o let the deceit come too near him; and the deceit will &s;teal over, &s;o that it will be an hard thing for him to get it down. There is no one &s;trikes his fellow-&s;er|vants, but fir&s;t he is gone from the pure in his own parti|cular; for when he goeth from the light he is enlightened withal, then he &s;trikes; and then he hath his reward: the light, which he is gone from, Chri&s;t, comes and gives him his reward. This is the &s;tate of the evil &s;ervants. The boi&s;terous, the ha&s;ty and ra&s;h, beget nothing to God; but the life, which doth reach the life, is that which begets to God. When all are &s;ettled in the life they are in that which remains for ever; and what is received there, is re|ceived from the Lord; and what one receiveth from the Lord, he keepeth; &s;o he &s;itteth &s;till, cool, and quiet in his own &s;pirit, and gives it forth as he is moved; but to the harlots, judgment.</P>
<P>Friends, This is the word of the Lord to you all, be watchful and careful in all meetings ye come into; for where friends are &s;itting together in &s;ilence, they are many times gathered into their own mea&s;ures. When a man is come newly out of the world, from mini&s;tering to the world's people, he cometh out of the dirt; and then he had need take heed that he be not ra&s;h. For when he comes into a &s;ilent meeting, that is another &s;tate; then he mu&s;t come, and feel his own &s;pirit, how it is when he comes to them that &s;it &s;ilent. If he be ra&s;h, they will judge him; that having been in the world, and among&s;t the world, the heat is not yet off him. For he may come in the heat of his &s;pirit out of the world; whereas the others are &s;till and cool; and his condition in that, not be|ing agreeable to theirs, he may rather do them hurt, by begetting them out of the cool &s;tate into the heating &s;tate; if he be not in that which commands his own &s;pirit, and gives him to know it.</P>
<P>There is great danger too in travelling abroad in the world. The &s;ame power, that moves any to go forth, is that which mu&s;t keep them. For it is the greate&s;t danger to go abroad, except a man be moved of the Lord, and go in the power of the Lord; for then, he keeping in the
<PB N="359" REF="037441_0436_100D90CC2FA01F98">power, is kept by it in his journey, and in his work; it will enable him to an&s;wer the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and keep above the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or. Every one feeling the danger to his own par|ticular in travelling abroad, there the pure fear of the Lord will be placed and kept in. Though they that travel may have openings when they are abroad, to mini&s;ter to others; yet, for their own particular growth, they mu&s;t dwell in the life which doth open; and that will keep down that which would boa&s;t. For the mini&s;ter cornes into the death, to that which is in the death and in pri&s;on: and &s;o returns up again into the life, into the power, and into the wi&s;dom, to pre&s;erve him clean.</P>
<P>This is the word of the Lord God to you all; feel, that ye &s;tand in the pre&s;ence of the Lord; for every man's word &s;hall be his burden; but the word of the Lord is pure, and an&s;wers the pure in every one. The Word of the Lord is that which was in the beginning, and brings to the begin|ning. It is an hammer to beat down the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or (not the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed) and as a fire to burn up that which is con|trary to it. Friends, come into that which is over all the &s;pirits of the world, fathoms all the &s;pirits of the world, and &s;tands in the patience; with that ye may &s;ee where others &s;tand, and reach that which is of God in every one. Here is no &s;trife, no contention, out of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: for he that goeth into &s;trife, and into contention, he is from the pure Spirit. For where any goeth into contention, if any thing hath been begotten by him before, that conten|tious nature doth get atop, &s;poileth that which was begot|ten, and quencheth his own prophe&s;ying. So if that be not &s;ubjected by the power in the particular, which would ari&s;e into &s;trife, that is dangerous.</P>
<P>If any one have a moving to any place, and have &s;po|ken what they were moved of the Lord, let them return to their habitation again, and live in the pure life of God, and in the fear of the Lord; &s;o will ye be kept in the life, in the &s;olid and &s;ea&s;oned &s;pirit, and preach as well in life as with words (none mu&s;t be light or wild.) For the feed of God is weighty, brings to be &s;olid, and leads into the wi&s;dom of God, by which the wi&s;dom of the creation is known. But if that part be up which runs into the ima|ginations, and that part be &s;tanding in which the imagi|nations come up, and the pure &s;pirit be not thoroughly come up to rule and reign, then that will run out that will glory, boa&s;t, and vapour; and &s;o will &s;uch an one
<PB N="360" REF="037441_0437_100D90CE93F58710">&s;poil that which opened to him; this is for condemnation. Let every one mind that which feels through and com|mands his &s;pirit, whereby every one may know what &s;pi|rit he is of; for he &s;hould fir&s;t try his own &s;pirit, and then he may try others; he &s;hould fir&s;t know his own &s;pirit, and then he may know others. Therefore that which doth command all the&s;e &s;pirits, where the heats and burnings come in and get up, in that wait which chains them down and cools: that is the elect, the heir of the promi&s;e of God. For no ha&s;ty, ra&s;h, brittle &s;pirits (though they have prophecies) have held out, and gone through, they not being &s;ubjected in the prophecy. The earthly will not abide, for it is brittle; in that &s;tate the mini&s;try was another's, not the Son's; for the Son hath life in him&s;elf, and the Son hath the power, which man being obedient to, he may be &s;erviceable: but if he go from the pure power, he falls and abu&s;eth it. Therefore let your faith &s;tand in the pure power of the Lord God, and do not abu&s;e it; but let that &s;earch through, and work through; and let every one &s;tand in the power of the Lord, which reacheth the &s;eed of God; which is the heir of the promi&s;e of life without end. Let none be ha&s;ty to &s;peak; for ye have time enough, and with an eye ye may reach the wit|ne&s;s; neither let any be backward when ye are moved; for that brings de&s;truction. Truth hath an honour in the hearts of tho&s;e who are not friends; &s;o that all friends be|ing kept in the truth, they are kept in the honour, they are honourable, for that will honour them; but if any lo&s;e the power, lo&s;e the life, they lo&s;e their crown, they lo&s;e their honour, they lo&s;e the cro&s;s which &s;hould crucify them, and they crucify the ju&s;t; and by lo&s;ing the power, the Lamb comes to be &s;lain. And as it is here, &s;o will it be in other nations; for all friends, here and there, are as one family: the &s;eed, the plants, they are as a family. All being kept in that which &s;ubjects all, and keeps all under, to wit, the &s;eed it&s;elf, the life it&s;elf, that is the heir of the promi&s;e; and that is the bond of peace: for there is the unity in the Spirit with God and with one another. He that is kept in the life hears God, and &s;ees man's con|dition; and with that he an&s;wers the life in others that hear God al&s;o: thus one friend, that is come into that, comprehends the world. But that which friends &s;peak, they mu&s;t live in; &s;o may they expect that others may come into that which they &s;peak, to live in the &s;ame. For
<PB N="361" REF="037441_0438_100D90D0D883F870">the power of the Lord God hath been abu&s;ed by &s;ome, and the worth of truth hath not been minded. There hath been a trampling on, and marring with the feet, and that abu&s;eth the power. But now every friend is to keep in the power, and to take heed to it; for that mu&s;t be kept down which would trample and mar with the feet, and the pure life and power of God is to be lived in over that; that none with the feet might foul or mar, but every one may be kept in the pure power and life of the Lord. Then the water of life cometh in; then he that mini&s;ter|eth drinketh him&s;elf, and giveth others to drink.</P>
<P>When any &s;hall be moved to go to &s;peak in a &s;teeple-hou&s;e or market, turn in to that which moves, and be obedient to it; that that which would not go may be kept down: for that which would not go will be apt to get up. And take heed on the other hand, that the lavi&s;hing part do not get up, for it is a bad &s;avour; therefore that mu&s;t be kept down and kept &s;ubject. Wait in the light of the Lord that ye may be all kept in the wi&s;dom of God. For when the &s;eed is up in every particular, there is no dan|ger; but when there is an opening and prophecy, and the power &s;tirs before the &s;eed comes up, there is &s;omething that will be apt to run out ra&s;hly; there's the danger, and there mu&s;t be the patience in the fear. For it is a weighty thing to be in the work of the mini&s;try of the Lord God, and to go forth in that. It is not as a cu&s;tomary preach|ing; it is to bring people to the end of all outward preach|ing. For when ye have declared the truth to the people, and they have received it, and are come into that which ye &s;pake of; the uttering of many words, and long de|clarations out of the life, may beget them into a form. And if any &s;hould run on ra&s;hly into words again, with|out the &s;avour of life, tho&s;e that are come into the thing he &s;pake of will judge him; whereby he may hurt again that which he had rai&s;ed up before. So friends, ye mu&s;t all come into the thing that is &s;poken in the openings of the heavenly life among you, and walk in the love of God, that ye may an&s;wer the thing &s;poken to.</P>
<P>And take heed all of running into inordinate affections; for when people come to own you, there is danger of the wrong part getting up. There was a &s;trife among the di&s;|ciples of Chri&s;t, who &s;hould be the greate&s;t? Chri&s;t told them, <Q>The heathen excrci&s;e lord&s;hip, and have domi|nion over one another; but it &s;hall not be &s;o among
<PB N="362" REF="037441_0439_100D90D26936BC48">you.</Q> For Chri&s;t the Seed was to come up in every one of them; &s;o then where is the greate&s;t? That part in the di&s;ciples, which looked to be the greate&s;t, was the &s;ame that was in the Gentiles. But who comes here to live in the Word that &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctified him, having the heart &s;anctified, the tongue and lips &s;anctified, living in the Word of wi&s;|dom, that makes clean the heart, and reconciles to God, all things being upheld by the Word and power; as there is an abiding in the Word of God, that upholds times and &s;ea&s;ons, and gives all things increa&s;e, here dwelling in the Word of wi&s;dom, if there be but two or three agreed in this on earth, it &s;hall be done for them in hea|ven. So in this mu&s;t all things be ordered by the Word of wi&s;dom and power, that upholds all things, the times and the &s;ea&s;ons, that are in the Father's hands; to the glory of God, whereby his ble&s;&s;ing may be felt among you; and this brings to the beginning. This is the word of the Lord God to you all, Keep down, keep low, that nothing may rule nor reign in you, but life it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The power being lived in, the cro&s;s is lived in; and where-ever friends come in this, they draw the power and the life over; they leave a witne&s;s behind them, an&s;wering the witne&s;s of God in others. Where this is lived in, there is no want of wi&s;dom, no want of power, no want of knowledge; he that mini&s;tereth in this, &s;eeth with the eye which the Lord openeth in him, what is for the fire, and what is for the &s;word, what mu&s;t be fed with judgment, and what mu&s;t be nouri&s;hed. This brings all down, and to be low, every one keeping to the power; for let a man get up ever &s;o high, he mu&s;t come down again to the power where he left; what he went from, he mu&s;t come down again to that. Before all the&s;e wicked &s;pirits be got down, which are rambling abroad, friends mu&s;t have pa|tience, mu&s;t wait in the patience, in the cool life; and who is in this doing the work of the Lord, he hath the ta&s;ting and the feeling of the Lamb's power and authority. There|fore all friends, keep cool and quiet in the power of the Lord God; and all that is contrary will be &s;ubjected; the Lamb hath the victory, in the &s;eed, through the patience.</P>
<P>If any have been moved to &s;peak, and have quenched that which moved them, let none &s;uch go forth afterwards into words, until they feel the power to ari&s;e and move them thereto again; for after the fir&s;t motion is quenched,
<PB N="363" REF="037441_0440_100D90D4556A3938">the other part will be apt to get up; and if any go forth in that, he goeth forth in his own, and the betrayer will come into that&mdash;And all friends, be careful not to med|dle with the powers of the earth; but keep out of all &s;uch things; as ye keep in the Lamb's authority, ye will an&s;wer that of God in them, and bring them to do ju&s;tice, which is the end of the law. Keep out of all jangling; for all that are in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion are out from the law of love; but all that are in the law of love come to the Lamb's power, in the Lamb's authority, who is the end of the law outward. For the law being added becau&s;e of transgre&s;|&s;ion, Chri&s;t, who was glorified with the Father before the world begain, in the end of the law; bringing them that live in the law of life, to live over all tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; which every particular mu&s;t feel in him&s;elf.</P>

<P>More was then &s;poken to many of the&s;e particulars; which was not taken at large as delivered.</P>
<P>After this meeting was over, and mo&s;t of the friends gone away, as I was walking in John Crook's garden, there came a party of hor&s;e, with a con&s;table, to &s;eize me. I heard them a&s;k, 'Who was in the hou&s;e?' Somebody made an|&s;wer, 'I was there.' They &s;aid, <Q>I was the man they looked for;</Q> and went forthwith into the hou&s;e, where they had many words with John Crook, and &s;ome few friends that were with him. But the Lord's power &s;o confounded them, that they came not into the garden to look for me; but went their way in a rage. When I came into the hou&s;e, friends were very glad to &s;ee them &s;o di&s;appointed, and that I had e&s;caped them. Next day I pa&s;&s;ed from thence: and after I had vi&s;ited friends in &s;everal places, came to London, the Lord's power accompanying me, and bearing me up in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I had not been long in London, before I heard that a Je&s;uit, who came over with an emba&s;&s;ador from Spain, had challenged all the Quakers to di&s;pute with them at the earl of Newport's hou&s;e; whereupon &s;ome friends let him know &s;ome would meet him. Then he &s;ent us word, <Q>He would meet with twelve of the wi&s;e&s;t learned men we had.</Q> Awhile after he &s;ent us word, <Q>He would meet with but &s;ix;</Q> after that, he &s;ent us word again, <Q>He would have but three to come.</Q> We ha&s;tened what we could. le&s;t, for all his great boa&s;t, he &s;hould put it quite off at la&s;t. When we were come to the hou&s;e, I bid Nicholas Bond
<PB N="364" REF="037441_0441_100D90D6A7FD2AD8">and Edward Burrough go up, and enter the di&s;cour&s;e with him; and I would walk awhile in the yard, and then come up after them. I advi&s;ed them to &s;tate this que&s;tion to him, <Q>Whether or no the church of Rome, as it now &s;tood, was not degenerated from the true church which was in the pri|mitive times, from the life and doctrine, and from the pow|er and &s;pirit that they were in?</Q> They &s;tated the que&s;tion accordingly: and the Je&s;uit affirmed, <Q>That the church of Rome now was in the virginity and purity of the primi|tive church.</Q> By this time I was come to them. Then we a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether they had the Holy Gho&s;t poured out upon them, as the apo&s;tles had?</Q> He &s;aid, 'No.' 'Then,' &s;aid I, <Q>If ye have not the &s;ame Holy Gho&s;t poured forth upon you, and the &s;ame power and Spirit that the apo&s;tles had, ye are degenerated from the power and Spirit which the primitive church was in.</Q> There needed little more to be &s;aid to that. Then I a&s;ked him, <Q>What &s;cripture they had for &s;etting up cloy&s;ters for nuns, abbeys and mona&s;teries for men; for all their &s;everal or|ders; for their praying by beads, and to images; for making cro&s;&s;es; for forbidding of meats and marriages; and for putting people to death for religion? If, (&s;aid I) ye are in the practice of the primitive church, in its pu|rity and virginity, then let us &s;ee by &s;criptures where-ever they practi&s;ed any &s;uch things?</Q> (For it was agreed on both hands, that we &s;hould make good by &s;criptures what we &s;aid.) Then he told us of a written word, and an un|written word? I a&s;ked him what he called his unwritten word? He &s;aid, <Q>The written word is the &s;criptures, and the unwritten word is that which the apo&s;tles &s;poke by word of mouth; which (&s;aid he) are all tho&s;e traditions that we practi&s;e.</Q> I bid him prove that by &s;cripture. Then he brought that &s;cripture where the apo&s;tle &s;ays, 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 5. <Q>When I was with you, I told you the&s;e things. That is,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I told you of nunneries and mona&s;teries, and of putting to death for religion, and of praying by beads, and to images, and all the re&s;t of the practices of the church of Rome; which,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>was the unwritten word of the apo&s;tles, which they told then, and have &s;ince been continued down by tradition unto the&s;e times.</Q> Then I de&s;ired him to read that &s;cripture <Q>again, that he might &s;ee how he had perverted the apo&s;|tles words; for that which the apo&s;tle there tells the The&s;&s;alonians, "he had told them before," is not an un|written
<PB N="365" REF="037441_0442_100D90D8C4CBEF90">word, but is there written down; namely, That the man of &s;in, the &s;on of perdition, &s;hall be revealed be|fore the great and terrible day of Chri&s;t, which he was writing of, &s;hould come: &s;o this was not telling them any of tho&s;e things that the church of Rome practi&s;es. In like manner the apo&s;tle, in the third chapter of that epi&s;|tle,</Q> tells the church of &s;ome di&s;orderly per&s;ons, <Q>he heard were among&s;t them, bu&s;y-bodies, who did not work at all; concerning whom he had commanded them by his unwritten word, when he was among them, that if any would not work, neither &s;hould he eat: which now he commands them again in his written word in this epi&s;|tle</Q> 2 The&s;&s;. iii. So this &s;cripture afforded no proof for their invented traditions, and he had no other &s;cripture-proof to offer. Therefore I told him, <Q>This was another degeneration of their church into &s;uch inventions and tra|ditions as the apo&s;tles and primitive &s;aints never practi&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>After this he came to his &s;acrament of the altar, begin|ning at the pa&s;chal lamb, and the &s;hew-bread, and came to the words of Chri&s;t, 'This is my body,' and to what the apo&s;tle wrote of it to the Corinthians; concluding, <Q>That after the prie&s;t had con&s;ecrated the bread and wine, it was immortal and divine, and he that received it, received the whole Chri&s;t.</Q> I followed him through the &s;criptures he brought, till I came to Chri&s;t's words and the apo&s;tle's. I &s;hewed him, <Q>That the &s;ame apo&s;tle told the Corinthi|ans, after they had taken bread and wine in remembrance of Chri&s;t's death, that they were reprobates, <Q>if Chri&s;t was not in them;</Q> but if the bread they ate was Chri&s;t, he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be in them after they had eaten it. Be&s;ides, if this bread and this wine, which the Corinthians ate and drank, was Chri&s;t's body, then how hath Chri&s;t a body in heaven? I ob&s;erved to him al&s;o, <Q>That both the di&s;ciples at the &s;upper, and the Corinthians afterwards, were to eat the bread and drink the wine in <Q>remem|brance of Chri&s;t.</Q> and to <Q>&s;hew forth his death till he come;</Q> which plainly proves the bread and wine, which they took, was not his body. For if it had been his real body that they ate, then he had been come, and was then there pre&s;ent, and it had been improper to have done &s;uch a thing in remembrance of him, if he had been then pre|&s;ent with them, as the mu&s;t have been, if that bread and wine which they ate and drank had been his real body.</Q> As to tho&s;e words of Chri&s;t, 'This is my body,' I told him,
<PB N="366" REF="037441_0443_100D90DA55790A30"><Q>Chri&s;t calls him&s;elf a vine, and a door, and is called in &s;cripture a rock. Is Chri&s;t therefore an outward rock, door, or vine?</Q> O, &s;aid the Je&s;uit, <Q>Tho&s;e words are to be interpreted;</Q> &s;o, &s;aid I, are tho&s;e words of Chri&s;t, "This is my body." Having &s;topped his mouth as to ar|gument, I made the Je&s;uit a propo&s;al thus; That &s;eeing he &s;aid, <Q>The bread and wine was immortal and divine, and the very Chri&s;t; and that who&s;oever received it, re|ceived the whole Chri&s;t;</Q> let a meeting be appointed be|tween &s;ome whom the pope and his cardinals &s;hould ap|point, and &s;ome of us; let a bottle of wine and loaf of bread be brought, and divided each into two parts, and let them con&s;ecrate which of tho&s;e parts they would. Then &s;et the con&s;ecrated and the uncon&s;ecrated bread and wine in a &s;afe place, with a &s;ure watch upon it; and let trial be thus made, Whether the con&s;ecrated bread and wine would not lo&s;e its goodne&s;s, and the bread grow dry and mouldy, and the wine turn dead and &s;our, as well and as &s;oon as that which was uncon&s;ecrated? By this means, &s;aid I, the truth of this matter may be made manife&s;t. And if the con&s;ecrated bread and wine change not, but retain their &s;avour and goodne&s;s, this may be a means to draw many to your church: if they change, decay, and lo&s;e their goodne&s;s, then ought you to confe&s;s and for&s;ake your error, and &s;hed no more blood about it: for much blood hath been &s;hed about the&s;e things; as in queen Ma|ry's days.</Q> To this the Je&s;uit made this reply, "Take," &s;aid he, <Q>a piece of new cloth, and cut it into two pieces, and make two garments of it, and put one of them upon king David's back, and the other upon a beggar's, and the one garment &s;hall wear away as well as the other.</Q> <Q>Is this thy an&s;wer, &s;aid I? Yes, &s;aid he. Then, &s;aid I, by this the company may all be &s;atisfied that your con&s;e|crated bread and wine is not Chri&s;t. Have ye told peo|ple &s;o long, that the con&s;ecrated bread and wine was im|mortal and divine, and that it was the very and real body and blood of Chri&s;t, and do&s;t thou now &s;ay it will wear away or decay as well as the other! I mu&s;t tell thee, "Chri&s;t remains the &s;ame to day as ye&s;terday," and never decays; but is the &s;aints heavenly food in all generations, through which they have life.</Q> He replied no more to this, being willing to let it fall; for the people that were pre&s;ent &s;aw his error, and that he could not defend it. Then I a&s;ked him, <Q>Why their church did per&s;ecute, and
<PB N="367" REF="037441_0444_100D90DBE65ACD48">put people to death for religion?</Q> He replied, <Q>It was not the church that did it, but the magi&s;trates.</Q> I a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether tho&s;e magi&s;trates were not counted and called believers and chri&s;tians?</Q> He &s;aid, Yes: <Q>Why then, &s;aid I, are they not members of your church?</Q> 'Yes,' &s;aid he. Then I left it to the people to judge from his own conce&s;&s;ions, whether the church of Rome doth not per&s;e|cute, and put people to death for religion. Thus we part|ed, and his &s;ubtilty was con&s;uted by &s;implicity.</P>
<P>During the time I was at London, I had many &s;ervices lay upon me; for it was a time of much &s;uffering. I was moved to write to O. Cromwel, and lay before him the &s;uf|ferings of friends both in this nation and in Ireland. There was al&s;o a talk about this time of making Cromwel king; where|upon I was moved to go to him, and warned him again&s;t accepting it, and of divers dangers; which if he did not avoid, I told him, <Q>He would bring &s;hame and ruin upon him&s;elf and his po&s;terity.</Q> He &s;eemed to take well what I &s;aid to him, and thanked me; yet afterwards I was mov|ed to write to him more fully concerning that matter.</P>
<P>About this time the lady Claypool (&s;o called) was &s;ick and much troubled in mind, and could receive no comfort from any that came to her; which when I heard of, I was moved to write her the following letter:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BE &s;till and cool in thy own mind and &s;pirit from thy own thoughts, and then thou wilt feel the principle of God to turn thy mind to the Lord, from whom life comes; whereby thou maye&s;t receive his &s;trength and power to allay all blu&s;terings, &s;torms and tempe&s;ts. That is it which works up into patience, into innocency, into &s;o|berne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, into &s;tillne&s;s, into &s;tayedne&s;s, into quietne&s;s up to God, with his power. Therefore mind, that is the word of the Lord unto thee, that the authority of God thou may&s;t feel, and thy faith in it, to work down that which troubles thee; for that is it which keeps peace and brings up the witne&s;s in thee, which hath been tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, to feel after God with his power and life, who is a God of order and peace. When thou art in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the life of God in thy own particular, the mind flies up in the air, the creature is led into the night, nature goes out of its cour&s;e, an old garment goes on, and an uppermo&s;t clothing: and thy nature being led out of its cour&s;e, it
<PB N="368" REF="037441_0445_100D90DDE3EA88C8">comes to be all on fire in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and that defac|eth the glory of the fir&s;t body. Therefore be &s;till awhile from thy own thoughts, &s;earching, &s;eeking, de&s;ires, and imaginations, and be &s;tayed in the principle of God in thee, that it may rai&s;e thy mind up to God, and &s;tay it upon God, and thou wilt &s;ind &s;trength from him, and find him to be a God at hand, a pre&s;ent help in the time of trouble and of need. And thou being come to the princi|ple of God, which hath been tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, it will keep thee humble; and the humble God will teach his way, which is peace, and &s;uch he doth exalt. Now as the principle of God in thee hath been tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, come to it, that it may keep thy mind down low to the Lord God; to deny thy|&s;elf, and from thy own will, that is the earthly, thou mu&s;t be kept. Then thou wilt feel the power of God, which will bring nature into its cour&s;e, and give thee to &s;ee the glory of the fir&s;t body. There the wi&s;dom of God will be received (which is Chri&s;t, by which all things were made and created) and thou be thereby pre&s;erved and ordered to God's glory. There thou wilt come to receive and feel the phy&s;ician of value, who clothes people in their right mind, whereby they may &s;erve God and do his will. For all di&s;tractions, unruline&s;s, and confu&s;ion are in the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion; which tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be brought down, be|fore the principle of God, which hath been tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t, be lifted up; whereby the mind may be &s;ea&s;oned and &s;tilled, and a right under&s;tanding of the Lord may be received; whereby his ble&s;&s;ings enter, and are felt over all that is contrary in the power of the Lord, which rai&s;es up the principle of God within, gives a feeling after God, and in time gives dominion. Keep in the fear of the Lord God; that is the word of the Lord unto thee. For all the&s;e things happen to thee for thy good, and for the good of tho&s;e concerned for thee, to make you know year&s;elves and your own weakne&s;s, that ye may know the Lord's &s;trength and power, and may tru&s;t in him. Let the time pa&s;t be &s;ufficient to every one, who in any thing hath been lifted up in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion out of the power of the Lord; for he can bring down and aba&s;e the mighty, and lay them in the du&s;t of the earth. Therefore, all keep low in his fear, that thereby ye may receive the &s;ecrets of God and his wi&s;dom, may know the &s;hadow of the Almighty, and &s;it under it in all tempe&s;ts, &s;torms, and heats. For God is a God at hand, and the Mo&s;t High rules in the
<PB N="369" REF="037441_0446_100D90E085F8ABD8">children of men. This is the word of the Lord God un|to you all; what the light doth make manife&s;t and di&s;|cover, as temptations, di&s;tractions, confu&s;ions; do not look at the&s;e temptations, confu&s;ions, corruptions, but at the light which di&s;covers them and makes them manife&s;t; and with the &s;ame light you may feel over them, to receive power to &s;tand again&s;t them. The &s;ame light which lets you &s;ee &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, will let you &s;ee the covenant of God, which blots out your &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, which gives victory and dominion over it, and brings into cove|nant with God. For looking down at &s;in, corruption, and di&s;traction, ye are &s;wallowed up in it; but looking at the light, which di&s;covers them, ye will &s;ee over them. That will give victory, and ye will find grace and &s;trength; there is the fir&s;t &s;tep to peace. That will bring &s;alvation; by it ye may &s;ee to the beginning, and the "Glory that "was with the Father before the world began;" and come to know the &s;eed of God, which is the heir of the promi&s;e of God, and of the world which hath no end; and which brui&s;es the head of the &s;erpent, who &s;tops people from coming to God. That ye may feel the power of an end|le&s;s life, the power of God which is immortal, which brings the immortal &s;oul up to the immortal God, in whom it doth rejoice. So in the name and power of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, God Almighty &s;trengthen thee.</P>

<P>When the foregoing paper was read to her, &s;he &s;aid, <Q>It &s;tayed her mind for the pre&s;ent.</Q> Afterwards many friends got copies of it, both in England and Ireland, and read it to people that were troubled in mind; and it was made u&s;eful for the &s;ettling of the minds of &s;everal.</P>
<P>About this time came forth a declaration from O.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the heads and governors of this nation, who have put forth a declaration for the keeping a day of &s;o|lemn fa&s;ting and humiliation, for the per&s;ecution (as you &s;ay) of divers people beyond the &s;eas profe&s;&s;ing the reformed religion, which, ye &s;ay, hath been tran&s;|mitted unto them from their ance&s;tors.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A PROFESSION of the reformed religion may be tran&s;|mitted to generations, and &s;o holden by tradition; and in that wherein the profe&s;&s;ion and tradition is holden, is the day of humiliation kept, which &s;tands in the will of man. This is not the fa&s;t that the Lord requires, "To "bow down the head like a bulru&s;h for a day," and the day following be in the &s;ame condition as they were the day before. To the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us in your con&s;ciences. do I &s;peak, which te&s;tifieth for God every day, and wit|ne&s;&s;eth again&s;t all &s;in and per&s;ecution; which mea&s;ure of God, if ye be guided by it, doth not limit God to a day, but leads to the fa&s;t the Lord requires, which is <Q>to loo&s;e, the bonds of wickedne&s;s, to undo the heavy burdens, to break every yoke, and to let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free,</Q> I&s;a. lviii. 6, 7. This is the fa&s;t that the Lord requires, and this &s;tands not in the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of times, nor in the tra|ditions of men. But this &s;tands in that which was before times were, and which leads out of time, and &s;hall be when time &s;hall be no more. The&s;e that teach for doctrine the commandments of men, are they that ever per&s;ecuted the life and power, when it came. And whereas ye mention a decree or edict that was made again&s;t the &s;aid per&s;ecuted prote&s;tants, all &s;uch decrees or edicts proceeded from the ground of the pope's religion and &s;upremacy, and therein &s;tands his tyranny and his cruelty, acted in that will which is in that nature which exerci&s;eth lord&s;hip over one ano|ther, as ye may read, Mark x. 42. Luke xxii. 25. as all the heathen do, and ever did; and in the heatheni&s;h na|ture is all the tyranny and per&s;ecution exerci&s;ed by them that are out of the obedience to the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us in the con&s;cience, which is the guide and leader of all,
<PB N="371" REF="037441_0448_100D90E3A6C33F90">who are tender of that of God in the con&s;cience. But who are not led by this, know not what it is to &s;uffer for con&s;cience &s;ake. Now, whereas ye take into your con&s;ide|ration the &s;ad per&s;ecution, tyranny, and cruelty exerci&s;ed upon them whom ye call your prote&s;tant brethren, and contribute and admini&s;ter to their wants outwardly; this is good in its place, and we own it; and &s;ee it good to admini&s;ter to the nece&s;&s;ities of others, and to do good to all; and we, who are &s;ufferers by a law derived from the pope, are willing to join and to contribute with you to their outward nece&s;&s;ities. For <Q>the earth is the Lord's, and the fulne&s;s thereof;</Q> who is good to all, gracious to all, and willing that all &s;hould be &s;aved and come to the knowledge of the truth. But in the mean time, while ye are doing this, and taking notice of others cruelty, tyran|ny, and per&s;ecution, turn your eye upon your&s;elves, and &s;ee what ye are doing at home. To the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us in all your con&s;ciences I &s;peak, which cannot lie, nor err, nor bear fal&s;e witne&s;s; but doth bear witne&s;s for God, and cries for equity, ju&s;tice, and righteou&s;ne&s;s to be executed. See what ye are doing who profe&s;s the &s;crip|tures, which were given forth by the &s;aints in light, who dwelt in the light and in the life of them. For the&s;e who now witne&s;s the &s;ame light, the &s;ame life, and the &s;ame power which gave forth the &s;criptures, which ye in words profe&s;s, them ye per&s;ecute, them ye hale out of your &s;y|nagogues and markets; them ye beat, &s;tock and impri&s;on. Let that of God in your con&s;ciences, which is ju&s;t, right|eous, and equal, examine and try whether ye have any example or precedent to exerci&s;e this per&s;ecution, which many now in this nation &s;uffer under, who are a people harmle&s;s and innocent, waiting in obedience towards God and man. And though ye account the way of truth they walk in here&s;y, yet therein do they exerci&s;e them&s;elves, to have always a <Q>con&s;cience void of offence towards God and man;</Q> as ye may read the &s;aints of old did, Acts xxiv. 14, 15, 16. not wronging any man, neither giving any ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence, only being obedient to the com|mands of the Lord, to declare as they are moved by the Holy Gho&s;t: and &s;tanding for the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience, &s;peaking the truth in Chri&s;t, their con&s;ciences bearing them witne&s;s that they lie not: for this do they &s;uf|fer under you, who in words profe&s;s the &s;ame thing for which they &s;uffer. Now &s;ee if any age or generation did
<PB N="372" REF="037441_0449_100D90E6BAFF8FB8">ever per&s;ecute as ye do? For ye profe&s;s Chri&s;t Je&s;us who reveals the Father, and per&s;ecute tho&s;e who witne&s;s the re|velation of the Father by Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto them. Ye profe&s;s Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who is the light of the world, <Q>that enlightens every one that cometh into the world;</Q> yet per|&s;ecute them that bear witne&s;s and give te&s;timony to this light. Ye profe&s;s that the word is become fle&s;h, yet per&s;e|cute them that witne&s;s it &s;o. Ye profe&s;s that who&s;oever confe&s;&s;eth not that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h is an antichri&s;t, yet per&s;ecute them that do confe&s;s him come in the fle&s;h, and call them antichri&s;ts and deceivers. Ye pro|fe&s;s that the kingdom of Chri&s;t is come, yet per&s;ecute them that witne&s;s it come. Ye profe&s;s Chri&s;t Je&s;us the re&s;urrec|tion and the life, yet per&s;ecute them that witne&s;s him to be &s;o. If ye &s;ay, <Q>How &s;hall we know that the&s;e people, who &s;ay they witne&s;s the&s;e things, do &s;o or no?</Q> I an|&s;wer, Turn your minds to the light which Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath enlightened you withal, which is one in all; and if ye walk in the light, ye &s;hall have the light of life; then ye will know and &s;ee what ye have done, who have per|&s;ecuted the Lord of Glory (in his people) in whom is life, and the life is the light of men. To no other touch&s;tone &s;hall we turn you, but into your own con&s;ciences; there may ye find the truth of what we have declared unto you, according to the holy &s;criptures. When the books of con|&s;ciences are opened, and all judged out of them, then &s;hall ye witne&s;s us to be of God, and our te&s;timony to be true. Though now ye may &s;top your ears, and harden your hearts, while it is called to-day, then ye &s;hall know what ye have done, and whom ye have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t; then ye will &s;ee that no per&s;ecutors, in any age or genera|tion before you, did ever tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t that light and mea&s;ure of God made manife&s;t in &s;uch manner as ye have done. For though Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles were per&s;ecut|ed in their time, the Jews for the mo&s;t part did not know that he was the Chri&s;t when he came, notwith&s;tanding they had the &s;criptures which prophe&s;ied of him, neither did they believe that he was ri&s;en again when the apo&s;tles preached his re&s;urrection. But ye &s;ay, <Q>Ye believe he is come, ye believe his re&s;urrection;</Q> yet ye per&s;ecute tho&s;e that witne&s;s him come in the fle&s;h, tho&s;e that are buried with him in bapti&s;m, tho&s;e that are conformable to his death, and know the power of his re&s;urrection: tho&s;e ye per&s;ecute, hale before magi&s;trates, and &s;uffer to be beaten
<PB N="373" REF="037441_0450_100D90E8ADE78A88">in your &s;ynagogues; tho&s;e ye cau&s;e to be whipped and &s;tocked, &s;hamefully entreated, ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and kept, as many gaols in this nation at this day te&s;tify to your &s;a|ces. Therefore hone&s;tly con&s;ider what ye are doing while ye are taking notice of others cruelties, le&s;t ye overlook your own. There is &s;ome difference in many things be|tween the popi&s;h religion and that which ye call the pro|te&s;tant, but in this per&s;ecution of yours there is no differ|ence; for ye will confe&s;s that the foundation of your reli|gion is grounded upon the &s;criptures, yet ye per&s;ecute them that are in the &s;ame life which they were in who gave forth the &s;criptures, your&s;elves being the meanwhile under a profe&s;&s;ion of the words they &s;poke: this ye &s;hall one day witne&s;s. So ye have a profe&s;&s;ion and form, and per&s;ecute them that are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, life, and power. Know a&s;&s;uredly that ye mu&s;t come to judgment; for he is made manife&s;t to whom all judgment is committed. To the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us in your con&s;ciences, which &s;earcheth and trieth you, turn your minds; &s;tand &s;till, and wait there to receive the righteous law, which is according to that of God in the con&s;cience, which is now ri&s;ing and bearing witne&s;s again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s of men; and they whom ye per&s;ecute are manife&s;t to God, and that of God in all con&s;ciences &s;hall bear witne&s;s for us that we are of God; this ye &s;hall one day witne&s;s, whether ye will hear or forbear. Our rejoicing is in the te&s;timony of our con&s;ciences, that in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity (not with fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the grace of God) we have had our conver&s;ation in the world, not handling the word of God deceitfully, but in the mani|fe&s;tation of the truth, commending our&s;elves to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God; and if our go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t. For witne&s;&s;ing the holding the my&s;tery of faith in a pure con&s;cience do we &s;uffer, and are &s;ubject for con&s;cience &s;ake. This is thank|worthy, if a man, for con&s;cience &s;ake, endure griefs and &s;ufferings wrongfully. In this is our joy and rejoicing, having a good con&s;cience, that whereas we are evil &s;poken of as evil-doers, they may be a&s;hamed that fal&s;ely accu&s;e our good conver&s;ation in Chri&s;t; which is not only the putting away the filth of the fle&s;h, but the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience towards God, by the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This we witne&s;s made manife&s;t (eternal prai&s;es to the living God!) and bear te&s;timony to that which
<PB N="374" REF="037441_0451_100D90EA42BED1E0">&s;poke it in the apo&s;tle in life and power. Therefore do we bear witne&s;s and te&s;tify again&s;t tho&s;e, who being got into a form and profe&s;&s;ion of it, do per&s;ecute the life and power. To the eternal light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the &s;earcher and trier of all hearts, turn your minds, and &s;ee what ye are doing; le&s;t ye overturn your foundation, whereon ye pretend to &s;tand, while ye are profe&s;&s;ing the &s;criptures, and per&s;ecuting the life, light, and power which tho&s;e were in who gave them forth. For the &s;tone cut out of the mountain without hands is now &s;triking at the feet of the image, the profe&s;&s;ion which is &s;et up, and &s;tands in the will of man. Now is that made manife&s;t, unto which all mu&s;t an&s;wer, and appear before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we per&s;uade men; but we are made manife&s;t unto God, and &s;hall be made manife&s;t in all your con&s;ciences, which ye &s;hall witne&s;s.</P>

<P>Divers times, both in the time of the long parliament, and of the protector (&s;o called) and of the committee of &s;afety, when they proclaimed fa&s;ts, I was moved to write to them, and tell them, their fa&s;ts, were like unto Jezebel's: for commonly, when they proclaimed fa&s;ts, there was &s;ome mi&s;chief contrived again&s;t us. I knew their fa&s;ts were for &s;trife and debate, to &s;mite with the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s; as the New-England profe&s;&s;ors &s;oon after did; who, before they put our friends to death, proclaimed a fa&s;t al&s;o.</P>
<P>Now it was a time of great &s;uffering; and many friends being in pri&s;ons, many other friends were moved to go to the parliament, to offer them&s;elves up to lie in the &s;ame pri&s;ons where their friends lay, that tho&s;e in pri&s;on might go forth, and not peri&s;h in the &s;tinking gaols. This we did in love to God and our brethren, that they might not die in pri&s;on; and in love to tho&s;e that ca&s;t them in, that they might not bring innocent blood upon their own heads; which we knew would cry to the Lord, and bring his wrath, vengeance, and plagues upon them. But little favour could we find from tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ing parliaments; in|&s;tead thereof, they would rage, and &s;ometimes threaten friends that attended them, to whip, and &s;end them home. Then commonly &s;oon after the Lord would turn them out,
<PB N="375" REF="037441_0452_100D90EBD3D604A8">and &s;end them home; who had not an heart to do good in the day of their power. But they went not off without being forewarned; for I was moved to write to them, in their &s;everal turns, as I did to the long-parliament, unto whom I declared, before they were broken up, <Q>that thick darkne&s;s was coming over them all, even a day of dark|ne&s;s that &s;hould be felt.</Q></P>
<P>And becau&s;e the parliament that now &s;at was made up mo&s;tly of high profe&s;&s;ors, who, pretending to be more re|ligious than others, were indeed greater per&s;ecutors of tho&s;e that were truly religious, I was moved to &s;end them the following lines, as a reproof of their hypocri&s;y:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>O FRIENDS, do not cloak and cover your&s;elves: there is a God that knoweth your hearts, and that will uncover you. He &s;eeth your way. <Q>Wo be to him that covereth, but not with my Spirit, &s;aith the Lord.</Q> Do ye act contrary to the law, and then put it from you! Mercy and true judgment ye neglect. Look, what was &s;poken again&s;t &s;uch. My Saviour &s;poke again&s;t &s;uch; <Q>I was &s;ick, and ye vi&s;ited me not: I was hungry, and ye fed me not: I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me not in: I was in pri&s;on, and ye vi&s;ited me not.</Q> But they &s;aid, <Q>When &s;aw we thee in pri&s;on, and did not come to thee? Ina&s;much as ye did it not unto one of the&s;e little ones, ye did it not unto me.</Q> Friends, ye impri&s;on them that are in the life and power of truth, and yet pro|fe&s;s to be the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t; but if Chri&s;t had &s;ens you, ye would bring out of pri&s;on, out of bondage, and receive &s;trangers. Ye have lived in plea&s;ure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nouri&s;hed your hearts, as in a day of &s;laughter; ye have condemned and killed the ju&s;t, and he doth not re&s;i&s;t you.</P>

<P>After this, as I was going out of town, having two friends with me, when we were little more than a mile out of the City, there met us two troopers belonging to colonel Hack|er's regiment, who took me, and the friends with me, and brought us back to the Mews, and there kept us pri&s;oners a little while; but the Lord's power was &s;o over them, that they did not bring us before any officer; but after awhile &s;et us at liberty. The &s;ame day, taking boat, I went to King&s;ton, and from thence to Hampton Court, to &s;peak
<PB N="376" REF="037441_0453_100D90EEB63C56A0">with the Protector about the &s;ufferings of friends. I met him riding into Hampton Court Park; and before I came to him, as he rode at the head of his life-guard, I &s;aw and felt a waft (or apparition) of death go forth again&s;t him; and when I came to him, he looked like a dead man. Af|ter I had laid the &s;ufferings of friends before him, and had warned him, as I was moved to &s;peak to him, he bid me come to his hou&s;e. So I returned to King&s;ton, and the next day went to Hampton Court, to have &s;poken further with him. But when I came, he was &s;ick, and&mdash;Har|vy, who waited on him, told me, The doctors were not willing I &s;hould &s;peak with him. So I pa&s;&s;ed away, and never &s;aw him more.</P>
<P>From King&s;ton I went to I&s;aac Penington's, in Buck|ingham&s;hire, where I had appointed a meeting; and the Lord's truth and power were preciou&s;ly manife&s;ted among&s;t us. After I had vi&s;ited friends in tho&s;e parts, I returned to London; and &s;oon after went into E&s;&s;ex; where I had not been long, before I heard the Protector was dead, and his &s;on Richard made Protector in his room. Whereupon I came to London again.</P>
<P>Before this time the church faith (&s;o called) was given forth, which was &s;aid to be made at the Savoy in eleven days. I got a copy of it before it was publi&s;hed, and wrote an an&s;wer to it: and when their book of church faith was &s;old up and down the &s;treets, my an&s;wer to it was &s;old al&s;o. This di&s;plea&s;ed &s;ome of the parliament-men; &s;o that one of them told me, 'They mu&s;t have me to Smithfield.' I told him, I was over their fires, and feared them not. Rea&s;oning with him, I wi&s;hed him to con&s;ider, Had all people been without a faith the&s;e &s;ixteen hundred years, that now the prie&s;ts mu&s;t make them one? Did not the apo&s;tle &s;ay that Je&s;us was the author and fini&s;her of their faith? And &s;ince Chri&s;t Je&s;us was the author of the apo&s;|tles faith, of the church's faith in the primitive times, and of the martyrs faith, &s;hould not all people look unto him to be the author and fini&s;her of their faith, and not to the prie&s;ts? A great deal of work we had about the prie&s;ts made-faith; for they called us hou&s;e-creepers, leading &s;illy women captive, becau&s;e we met in hou&s;es, and would not hold up their prie&s;ts and temples which they had made and &s;et up. I told them, it was they that led &s;illy women cap|tive, and crept into hou&s;es, who kept people always learn|ing under them, who were covetous, and had got a form
<PB N="377" REF="037441_0454_100D90F0A5641138">of godline&s;s, but denied the power and Spirit, which the apo&s;tles were in. Such began to creep in the apo&s;tles days; but now they had got the magi&s;trates on their &s;ide, who upheld tho&s;e hou&s;es for them, which they had crept into, their temples, with their tithes: whereas the apo&s;tles brought people off from even that temple, and tho&s;e tithes and offerings, which God had for a time commanded. And the apo&s;tles met in &s;everal private hou&s;es, being to preach the go&s;pel in all nations; which they did freely, as Chri&s;t commanded them. Thus do we, who bring people off from the&s;e prie&s;ts, temples, and tithes (which God never commanded) to meet in hou&s;es, or on mountains, as the &s;aints of old did, who were gathered in the name of Je&s;us; and Chri&s;t was their Prophet, Prie&s;t and Shepherd.</P>
<P>Major Wiggan, a very envious man, was pre&s;ent, yet he bridled him&s;elf before the parliament-men, and &s;ome others that were there in company. He took upon him to a&s;&s;ert, <Q>Chri&s;t had taken away the guilt of &s;in, but had left the power of &s;in remaining in us.</Q>I told him, that was &s;trange doctrine; for Chri&s;t came to de&s;troy the devil's works, and the power of &s;in, and &s;o to clean&s;e men from &s;in. So major Wiggan's mouth was &s;topped at that time. But next day de&s;iring to &s;peak with me again, I took a friend or two with me, and went to him. Then he vented a great deal of pa&s;&s;ion and rage, beyond the bounds of a chri&s;tian, or moral man; whereupon I was made to reprove him; and having brought the Lord's power over him, and let him &s;ee what condition he was in, left him.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time I pa&s;&s;ed out of London, and had a meeting at &s;ergeant Birkhead's at Twickenham, to which many people came; &s;ome of con&s;iderable quality. A glo|rious meeting it was, wherein the &s;criptures were largely and clearly opened, and Chri&s;t exalted above all, to the great &s;atisaction of the hearers.</P>
<P>But there was great per&s;ecution in many places, both by impri&s;oning and breaking up of meetings. At a meeting about &s;even miles from London, the rude people u&s;ually came out of &s;everal pari&s;hes round about, to abu&s;e friends, and often beat and brui&s;ed them exceedingly. One day they abu&s;ed about eighty friends, that went to that meet|ing out of London, tearing their coats and cloaks from off their backs, throwing them into ditches and ponds; and, when they had be&s;meared them with dirt, they &s;aid they looked like witches. The next fir&s;t-day I was moved of
<PB N="378" REF="037441_0455_100D90F2344BB5E8">the Lord to go to that meeting, though I was then very weak. When I came there, I bid friends bring a table, and &s;et it in the clo&s;e, where they u&s;ed to meet, to &s;tand upon. According to their wonted cour&s;e, the rude people came; and I, having a bible in my hand, &s;hewed them theirs and their teachers fruits; and the people became a&s;hamed, and were quiet. I opened the &s;criptures to them, and our principles agreeing therewith; and turned them from darkne&s;s to the light of Chri&s;t and his Spirit, by which they might under&s;tand the &s;criptures, &s;ee them&s;elves and their &s;ins, and know Chri&s;t Je&s;us to be their Saviour. So the meeting ended quietly, and the Lord's power came over all, to his glory. But it was a time of great &s;ufferings; for be&s;ides impri&s;onments (through which many died) our meetings were greatly di&s;turbed. They have thrown rotten eggs and wild-fire into our meetings, and brought in drums beating, and kettles, to make noi&s;es with, that the truth might not be heard; and, among the&s;e, the prie&s;ts were as rude as any; as may be &s;een in the book of the fighting prie&s;ts, wherein a li&s;t is given of &s;ome prie&s;ts that had actu|ally beaten and abu&s;ed friends.</P>
<P>Many friends were brought pri&s;oners to London, to be tried before the Committee; where Henry Vane, being chairman, would not &s;uffer friends to come in, except they would put off their hats; but at la&s;t the Lord's power came over him, &s;o that through the mediation of others, they were admitted. Many of us having been impri&s;oned upon contempts (as they called them) for not putting off our hats, it was not a likely thing that friends, who had &s;uffered &s;o long for it from others, &s;hould put off their hats to him. But the Lord's power came over all, and wrought &s;o, that &s;everal were &s;et at liberty by them. Ina&s;much as &s;ufferings grew very &s;harp, I was moved of the Lord to write a few lines, and &s;end among friends, to encourage them to go on faithfully and boldly through the exerci&s;es of the day; of which a copy here follows:</P>

<P>After awhile I went to Reading, where I remained under great &s;ufferings and exerci&s;es, and in great travail of &s;pirit for about ten weeks. For I &s;aw there was great confu&s;ion and di&s;traction among&s;t the people, and that the powers were plucking each other to pieces. And I &s;aw how many were de&s;troying the &s;implicity, and betraying the truth. A great deal of hypocri&s;y, deceit, and &s;trife, was got upper|mo&s;t in the people, &s;o that they were ready to &s;heath their &s;words in one another's bowels. There had been tender|ne&s;s in many of them formerly, when they were low; but when they were got up, had killed, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they came to be as bad as others: &s;o that we had much to do with them about our hats, and &s;aying Thou and Thee to them. They turned their profe&s;&s;ion of patience and moderation into rage and madne&s;s; many of them were like di&s;tracted men for this hat-honour. For they had hard|ened them&s;elves by per&s;ecuting the innocent, and were at this time crucifying the Seed, Chri&s;t, both in them&s;elves and others; till at la&s;t they fell a biting and devouring one another, until they were con&s;umed one of another; who had turned again&s;t and judged that which God had wrought in them, and &s;hewed unto them. So &s;hortly after God overthrew them, turned them up&s;ide down, and brought the king over them, who were often &s;urmi&s;ing that the Quakers met together to bring in king Charles, whereas friends did not concern them&s;elves with the outward powers or government. But at la&s;t the Lord brought him in, and many of them, when they &s;aw he would be brought in, voted for the bringing him in. So with heart and voice prai&s;e the name of the Lord, to whom it doth belong; who
<PB N="380" REF="037441_0457_100D90F62EC1CD88">over all hath the &s;upremacy, and who will rock the nations, for he is over them. I had a &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of the king's return a good while before, and &s;o had &s;ome others. I wrote to Oliver &s;everal times, and let him know, that while he was per&s;ecuting God's people, they whom he accounted his enemies were preparing to come upon him. When &s;ome forward &s;pirits, that came among&s;t us, would have bought Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, that we might have meetings in it, I forbad them to do &s;o: for I then fore&s;aw the king's com|ing in again. Be&s;ides, there came a woman to me in the Strand, who had a prophecy concerning king Charles's coming in, three years before he came; and &s;he told me, &s;he mu&s;t go to him to declare it. I advi&s;ed her to wait upon the Lord, and keep it to her&s;elf; for if it &s;hould be known that &s;he went on &s;uch a me&s;&s;age, they would look upon it to be trea&s;on; but &s;he &s;aid, &s;he mu&s;t go and tell him, that he &s;hould be brought into England again. I &s;aw her prophecy was true, and that a great &s;troke mu&s;t come upon tho&s;e in power: for they that had then got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion were &s;o exceeding high, and &s;uch great per&s;ecution was acted by them who called them&s;elves &s;aints, that they would take from friends their copyhold lands, becau&s;e they could not &s;wear in their courts. Sometimes, when we laid the&s;e &s;uf|ferings before Oliver Cromwel, he would not believe it. Wherefore Thomas Aldam and Anthony Pear&s;on were moved to go through all the gaols in England, and to get copies of friends commitments under the gaolers hands, that they might lay the weight of their &s;ufferings upon Oli|ver Cromwel. And when he refu&s;ed to give order for the relea&s;ing of them, Thomas Aldam was <Q>moved to take his cap off his head, and rend it in pieces before him, and to &s;ay unto him, <Q>So &s;hall thy government be rent from thee and thy hou&s;e.</Q> Another friend al&s;o, a woman, was moved to go to the parliament (that was envious again&s;t friends) with a pitcher in her hand, which &s;he broke into pieces before them,</Q> and told them, <Q>So &s;hould they be broken to pieces:</Q> which came to pa&s;s &s;hortly after. And in my great &s;uffering, and travail of &s;pirit for the nation, being grievou&s;ly burdened with their hypocri&s;y, treachery, and fal&s;ehood, I &s;aw God would bring that atop of them which they had been atop of; and that all mu&s;t be brought down to that which convinced them, before they could get over that bad &s;pirit within and without: for it is the pure,
<PB N="381" REF="037441_0458_100D90F825779938">invi&s;ible Spirit, that doth and only can work down all de|ceit in people.</P>
<P>While I was under that &s;ore travail at Reading, by rea|&s;on of grief and &s;orrow of mind, and the great exerci&s;e that was upon my &s;pirit, my countenance being altered, and my body become poor and thin; there came a company of un|clean &s;pirits to me, and told me, <Q>The plagues of God were upon me.</Q> I told them, It was the &s;ame &s;pirit &s;poke in them that &s;aid &s;o of Chri&s;t, when he was &s;tricken and &s;mitten; they hid their face from him. But when I had travailed with the witne&s;s of God, which they had quench|ed, and had got through with it, over all that hypocri&s;y which the out&s;ide profe&s;&s;ors were run into, and &s;aw how that would be brought down, and turned under, and that life would ri&s;e over it, I came to have ea&s;e; and the light, power, and &s;pirit, &s;hined over all. And then, having re|covered. my body and face &s;welled, when I came abroad into the air; then the bad &s;pirits &s;aid, 'I was grown fat;' and they envied at that al&s;o. So I &s;aw that no condition nor &s;tate would plea&s;e that &s;pirit of theirs: but the Lord pre&s;erved me by his power and Spirit through and over all; and in the Lord's power I came to London again.</P>
<P>Now was there a great bu&s;tle about the effigy of Oliver Cromwel lying in &s;tate; men &s;tanding and &s;ounding with trumpets over his image, after he was dead. At this my &s;pirit was greatly grieved, and the Lord, I found, was high|ly offended. Then did I write the following lines, and &s;ent among them, to reprove their wickedne&s;s, and warn them to repent.</P>

<P>About this time great &s;tirs were in the nation, the minds of people being un&s;ettled. Much plotting and contriving there was by the &s;everal factions, to carry on their &s;everal intere&s;ts. And a great care being upon me, le&s;t any young or raw people, that might &s;ometimes come among&s;t us, &s;hould be drawn into that &s;nare, I was moved to give forth the following epi&s;tle, as a warning to &s;uch:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL friends every where, keep out of plots and bu&s;|tling, and the arm of fle&s;h; for all the&s;e are among&s;t Adam's &s;ons in the fall, where they are de&s;troying men's lives like dogs, bea&s;ts, and &s;wine, goring, rending, and biting one another, de&s;troying one another, and wre&s;tling with fle&s;h and blood. From whence ari&s;e wars and killing, but from the lu&s;ts? Now all this is in Adam in the fall, out of Adam that never fell, in whom there is peace and life. Ye are called to peace, therefore follow it; that peace is in Chri&s;t, not in Adam in the fall. All that pretend to fight for Chri&s;t, are deceived; for his kingdom is not of this world, therefore his &s;ervants do not fight. Fighters are not of Chri&s;t's kingdom, but are without Chri&s;t's king|dom: for his kingdom &s;tands in peace and righteou&s;ne&s;s, but fighters are in the lu&s;t: and all that would de&s;troy men's lives are not of Chri&s;t's mind, who came to &s;ave men's lives. Chri&s;t's kingdom is not of this world; it is peaceable: and all that are in &s;trife, are not of his king|dom. All that pretend to fight for the go&s;pel, are deceiv|ed: for the go&s;pel is the power of God, which was before the devil, or fall of man was: and the go&s;pel of peace was before fighting was. Therefore they that pretend fighting, and talk of &s;ighting &s;o, are ignorant of the go&s;|pel. All that talk of fighting for Sion, are in darkne&s;s: Sion needs no &s;uch helpers. All &s;uch as profe&s;s them|&s;elves mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, or chri&s;tians, and go about to beat down the whore with outward, carnal weapons, the fle&s;h and the where are got up in them&s;elves, and they are in a blind zeal: for the whore got up by the inward ra|vening from the Spirit of God; and the beating down of the whore mu&s;t be by the inward &s;troke of the &s;word of the Spirit within. All &s;uch as pretend Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and confe&s;s him, yet run into the u&s;e of carnal weapons, wre&s;t|ling
<PB N="383" REF="037441_0460_100D90FBABE51750">with fle&s;h and blood, throw away the &s;piritual wea|pons. They that would be wre&s;tlers with fle&s;h and blood, throw away Chri&s;t's doctrine; the fle&s;h is got upon them, and they are weary of their &s;ufferings. Such as would revenge them&s;elves, are out of Chri&s;t's doctrine. Such as being &s;tricken on one cheek, would not turn the other, are out of Chri&s;t's doctrine. Such as do not love one another, nor love enemies, are out of Chri&s;t's doctrine. Therefore ye, that are heirs of the ble&s;&s;ings of God, which were before the cur&s;e and the fall was, come to inherit your portions: and ye that are heirs of the go&s;pel of peace, which was before the devil was, live in the go&s;pel of peace, &s;eeking the peace and good of all men: and live in Chri&s;t, who came to &s;ave men's lives, out of Adam in the fall, where they de&s;troy men's lives, and live not in Chri&s;t. The Jews &s;word outwardly, by which they cut down the heathen, was a type of the Spirit of God within, which cuts down the heatheni&s;h nature within. So live in the peaceable kingdom of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Live in the peace of God, and not in the lu&s;ts, from whence wars ari&s;e. Live in Chri&s;t, the prince of peace, the way of God, the &s;econd Adam that never fell. Live not in Adam in the fall, in the de&s;truction, where they de&s;troy one another. Come out of Adam in the fall, into the &s;econd Adam that never fell. Live in love and peace with all men; keep out of all the bu&s;tlings in the world; meddle not with the powers of the earth; but mind the kingdom, the way of peace. Ye that are heirs of grace, heirs of the kingdom, heirs of the go&s;pel, heirs of &s;alvation, &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High, and children of God, who&s;e conver&s;ation is in heaven, that is above the combu&s;tions of the earth; let your conver&s;ation preach to all men, and your inno|cent lives, that tho&s;e who &s;peak evil of you, beholding your godly conver&s;ation, may glorify your Father which is in heaven. Friends every where, this I charge you, which is the word of the Lord God unto you all, <Q>Live in peace, in Chri&s;t the way of peace;</Q> therein &s;eek the peace of all men, and no man's hurt. In Adam in the &s;all is no peace; but in Adam out of the fall is the peace: So ye being in Adam which never fell, it is love that overcomes, not hatred with hatred, nor &s;trife with &s;trife. Therefore live all in the peaceable life, doing good to all men, and &s;eeking the good and welfare of all men.</P>

Not long after this, George Booth ro&s;e in arms in Che|&s;hire, and Lambert went again&s;t him. At which time &s;ome fooli&s;h ra&s;h &s;pirits, that came &s;ometimes among&s;t us, were ready to have taken up arms; but I was moved of the Lord to warn and forbid them, and they were quiet. In the time of the committee of &s;afety (&s;o called) we were invited by them to take up arms, and great places and commands were offered &s;ome of us; but we denied them all, and declared again&s;t it both by word and writing; te&s;tifying, that our weapons and armour were not carnal, but &s;piritual.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL friends every where, take heed to keep out of the powers of the earth, that run into wars and fightings, which make not for peace, but go from that; &s;uch will not have the kingdom. And friends, take heed of joining with this or the other, or meddling with any, or being bu&s;y with other men's matters; but mind the Lord, his power, and his &s;ervice. Let friends keep out of other men's matters, and keep in that which an&s;wers the witne&s;s in them all, out of the man's matters part, where they mu&s;t expect wars, and the di&s;honour. Friends every where, dwell in your own, in the power of the Lord, to keep your minds up to God, from falling down to the &s;trength of Egypt, or going thither for &s;trength, after ye are come out of it, like the children of I&s;rael, after they were come out of outward Egypt. But dwell in the power of the Lord God, that ye may keep over all the powers of the earth, among&s;t whom the ju&s;t hand of God is come: for they have turned again&s;t the ju&s;t, and di&s;obeyed the ju&s;t in their own particulars, and &s;o gone on in one again&s;t the ju&s;t; therefore the ju&s;t &s;ets them one again&s;t another.

<P>After I had &s;taid &s;ome time in London, and had vi&s;ited friends meetings there and thereabouts, and the Lord's power was &s;et over all, I travelled into the counties again, pa&s;&s;ing through Suffolk, E&s;&s;ex, and Norfolk, vi&s;iting friends, till I came to Norwich, where we had a meeting about the time called Chri&s;tmas. The mayor of Norwich, having got notice beforehand of the meeting I intended to have there, granted a warrant to apprehend me. Wherefore when I was come thither, and heard of the warrant, I &s;ent &s;ome friends to the mayer to rea&s;on with him about it. His an&s;wer was, the &s;oldiers &s;hould not meet; and did we think to meet? he would have had us met without the city: for he &s;aid, the town's-people were &s;o rude, that he could hardly order them, and he feared that our meeting would make tumults in the town. But our friends told him, we were a peaceable people, and that he ought to keep the peace; for we could not but meet to wor&s;hip God, as our manner was. So he became pretty moderate, and did not &s;end his officers to the meeting. A large meeting it was, and abundance of rude people came, with intent to have done mi&s;chief: but the Lord's power came over them, &s;o that they were chained by it, though &s;everal prie&s;ts were there, and profe&s;&s;ors, and Ranters. Among the prie&s;ts, one, who&s;e name was Town&s;end, &s;tood up and cried, Error, bla&s;phemy, and an ungodly meeting! I bad him not burden him&s;elf with that which he could not make good; and I a&s;ked him, what was our error and bla&s;phemy? for I told him, he &s;hould make good his words, before I had done with him, or be &s;hamed. As for an ungodly meeting, I &s;aid, I did believe there were many people there that feared God, and therefore it was both unchri&s;tian and uncivil in him, to charge civil godly people with an ungodly meeting. He &s;aid,
<PB N="386" REF="037441_0463_100D910200865A88">My error and bla&s;phemy was, in that I &s;aid, people mu&s;t wait on God by his power and Spirit, and feel his pre&s;ence, when they did not &s;peak words: I a&s;ked him then, Whe|ther the apo&s;tles and holy men of God did not hear God &s;peak to them in their &s;ilence, before they &s;pake forth the Scripture, and before it was written? He replied, Yes: David and the prophets did hear God, before they did pen the &s;criptures, and felt his pre&s;ence in &s;ilence, before they &s;pake them forth. Then &s;aid I, All people take notice, he &s;aid this was error and bla&s;phemy in me to &s;ay the&s;e words; and now he hath confe&s;&s;ed it is not more than the holy men of God in former times witne&s;&s;ed. So I &s;hewed the people, that as the holy men of God, who gave forth the Scriptures, were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, did hear and learn of God, before they &s;pake them forth, &s;o mu&s;t they all heark|en and hear what the Spirit &s;aith, which will lead them into all truth, that they may know God and Chri&s;t, and may under&s;tand the Scriptures. O, &s;aid the prie&s;t, this is not that George Fox I would &s;peak withal; this is a &s;ubtil man, &s;aid he. So the Lord's power came over all, the rude peo|ple were moderate, and were reached by it; and &s;ome pro|fe&s;&s;ors called to the prie&s;ts, &s;aying, <Q>Prove the bla&s;phe|my and errors, which ye have charged them with: ye have &s;poken much again&s;t them behind their backs, but nothing ye can prove now to their faces.</Q> But the prie&s;t began to get away: whereupon I told him, we had many things to charge him withal, therefore let him &s;et a time and place to an&s;wer them; which he did and went his way. A glorious day this was: for truth came over all, and people were turned to God by his power and Spirit, and to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their free teacher, who was exalted over all. And as we pa&s;&s;ed away, generally people's hearts were filled with love towards us; yea, the ruder &s;ort of them de|&s;ired another meeting: for the evil intentions they had again&s;t us were thrown out of their hearts. At night I pa&s;|&s;ed out of town to a friend's hou&s;e, and from thence to colo|nel Dennis's, where we had a great meeting: and afterwards travelled on, vi&s;iting friends up and down in Norfolk, Hunt|ington&s;hire, and Cambridge&s;hire. But George Whitehead, and Richard Hubberthorn &s;taid about Norwich, to meet the prie&s;t, who was &s;oon confounded and down, the Lord's power came &s;o over him.</P>
<P>After I had travelled through many counties in the Lord's &s;ervice, and many were convinced, notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="387" REF="037441_0464_100D9103D172B0A8">that in &s;ome places the people were very rude, I returned to London again, when general Monk was come up thither, and the gates and po&s;ts of the city were pulling down. <Q>Long before this I had a vi&s;ion, wherein I &s;aw the city lie in heaps, and the gates down; and it was then repre|&s;ented to me, ju&s;t as I &s;aw it &s;everal years after, lying in heaps when it was burned.</Q></P>
<P>Divers times had I, both by word and writing, forewarn|ed the &s;everal powers, both in Oliver's time and after, of the day of recompen&s;e that was coming upon them: but they rejecting coun&s;el, and &s;lighting tho&s;e vi&s;itations of love to them, I was moved now, before they were quite over|turned; to lay their back&s;liding, hypocri&s;y, and treacherous dealing before them, thus:</P>

<P>FRIENDS, Now are the prophecies fulfilled and ful|filling upon you, which have been &s;poken to you by the people of God in your courts, in your &s;teeple-hou&s;es, in your towns, cities, markets, highways, and at your fea&s;ts, when ye were in your plea&s;ures, and puffed up, that ye would neither hear God nor man; when ye were in your height of authority, though rai&s;ed up from a mean &s;tate, none might come nigh you without bow|ing, or the re&s;pect of per&s;ons, for ye were in the world's way, compliments and fa&s;hions, which for con&s;cience &s;ake towards God, they could not go into, being redeemed therefrom: therefore they were hated by you for that cau&s;e. But how are ye brought low, who exalted your&s;elves above your brethren, and threw the ju&s;t and harmle&s;s from among you, until at la&s;t God hath thrown you out: and when ye ca&s;t the innocent from among&s;t you, then ye fell a biting one another, until ye were con&s;umed one of another. And &s;o the day is come upon you, which be|fore was told to you, though ye would not believe it. And are not your hearts &s;o hardened, that ye will hardly yet believe, though ready to go into captivity? was it not told you, when ye &s;pilt the blood of the innocent in your &s;tee|ple-hou&s;es, in your markets, in your highways and cities, yea, and even in your courts al&s;o, becau&s;e they &s;aid the word Thou to you, and could not put off their hats to you, <Q>That if &s;omething did not ri&s;e up among&s;t your&s;elves, to avenge the blood of the innocent, there would come &s;omething from beyond the &s;eas, which lay re&s;erved there; which being brought by the arin of God, the arm of fle&s;h

When ye pretended to &s;et up the old cau&s;e, it was but your&s;elves; for which ye long &s;tunk to &s;ober people, who &s;aw that ye would do no good. But it was a joy for any of you to get up into authority, that ye might have prai&s;e, and honour, and re&s;pect; and they that were in the &s;elf-denial were a deri&s;ion to you; from among&s;t whom that was bani&s;hed. Thus ye became the nations ma&s;ters, and not &s;ervants; whereas the greate&s;t of all &s;hould be the &s;ervants of all. But there ye lo&s;t your authority, not con&s;idering your e&s;tates, from whence ye were, and to what end God had rai&s;ed you up; but for|got the Lord, and quenched that which was good in your|&s;elves, and per&s;ecuted them that lived in it: and &s;o are grown &s;o gro&s;s and perver&s;e, that at la&s;t ye are fit for neither God nor man. Have not ye u&s;ed to call the Qua|kers the fanatic people, and the giddy heads? but whither now are ye giddying? into Cain's city Nod, which &s;igni|fies fugitive, or wandering? Have not ye per&s;ecuted and impri&s;oned to death, &s;uch as God had re&s;pect to, and is now reproving you for their &s;akes, by them whom ye have hated? Were not many among&s;t you cut off for your per&s;ecution, and yet the re&s;t of you would not take warn|ing? Was not there a book of examples &s;et out unto you, of what &s;udden and &s;trange deaths happened upon the per&s;ecutors of the innocent? and yet ye would not take warning, until the overflowing &s;courge is now coming upon you. Are not ye they that have killed like Cain, who have killed about your &s;acrifice, and mingled the blood of the innocent with it? Hath not God now vagabonded you, that ye &s;hould become a cur&s;e upon the earth, who have per&s;ecuted friends to death? Did not the blood of the righteous cry out of the ground for vengeance? And will not the blood of the righteous be required? Could ye think, that the Lord would &s;it always with bloody hands, and fi&s;ts of wickedne&s;s! Ah! What's become of

<P>Being now clear of the city, and finding my &s;pirit drawn to vi&s;it friends in the we&s;tern parts of England, I went out of town; and pa&s;&s;ing fir&s;t into Surry and Su&s;&s;ex, came to a great town, where there was a large meeting, to which &s;everal frieds from Reading came; and a ble&s;&s;ed meeting it was. The prie&s;t of the town was in a great rage, but did not come out of his hou&s;e, wherefore, hearing him make a great noi&s;e in his hou&s;e, as we were pa&s;&s;ing from the meet|ing, we bid him come out into the &s;treet, and we would di&s;|cour&s;e with him; but he would not. So the Lord's power being over all, friends were refre&s;hed therein. From thence I went to another market-town, where in the evening we had a precious meeting; and the fre&s;h &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ence of the Lord God was &s;weetly felt among&s;t us. Then turn|ing into Hamp&s;hire and Dor&s;et&s;hire, I went to Ringwood and Pool, vi&s;iting friends in the Lord's power, and had great meetings among&s;t them.</P>
<P>At Dorche&s;ter we had a great meeting in the evening at our inn, to which many &s;oldiers came, and were pretty civil. But the con&s;tables and officers of the town came, under pretence to look for a Je&s;uit, who&s;e head (they &s;aid) was &s;haved: and they would have all to put off their hats, or el&s;e they would take them off, to look for the Je&s;uit's &s;haven crown. So they took off my hat (for I was the man they aimed at) and they looked very narrowly; but not finding any bald or &s;haven place on my head, they went away with &s;hame; and the &s;oldiers, and other &s;ober people were greatly offended with them. But it was of good &s;er|vice for the Lord, and all things wrought together for good; for it affected the people: and after the officers were gone, we had a fine meeting; and people were turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their teacher, who had bought them, and would reconcile them to God.</P>
<P>From thence we pa&s;&s;ed into Somer&s;et&s;hire, where the pre&s;byterians and other profe&s;&s;ors were very wicked, and often di&s;turbed friends meetings. <Q>One time e&s;pecially (as we were then informed) a very wicked man put a bear's &s;kin on his back, and undertook with that to play pranks in the meeting. Accordingly, &s;etting him&s;elf oppo&s;ite to the friend that was &s;peaking, he lolled his tongue out of
<PB N="390" REF="037441_0467_100D910A10B60F98">his mouth, and made &s;port to his wicked followers, cau&s;ing great di&s;turbance in the meeting. But an eminent judg|ment overtook him, and his puni&s;hment &s;lumbered not; for as he went from the meeting there was a bull-baiting in the way, which he &s;tayed to &s;ee; and coming within the bull's reach, he &s;truck h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orn under the man's chin into his throat, and thra&s;t his tongue out of his mouth, &s;o that it hung lolling out, as he had u&s;ed it before in deri&s;ion in the meeting. And the bull's horn running up into the man's head, he &s;wung him about upon his horn in a mo&s;t remarkable and fearful manner. Thus he that came to do mi&s;chief among&s;t God's people was mi&s;chieved him&s;elf; and well would it be if &s;uch apparent examples of divine vengeance would teach others to beware.</Q></P>
<P>We travelled through Somer&s;et&s;hire and Devon&s;hire, till we came to Plymouth, and &s;o into Cornwall, vi&s;iting the meetings of friends, to the Land's-end. Many precious and ble&s;&s;ed meetings we had all along as we went, wherein the convinced were e&s;tabli&s;hed, and many others were added to them. At the Land's-end an hone&s;t fi&s;herman was convin|ced, who became a faithful mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t. I took no|tice of him to friends, telling them, 'He was like Peter.'</P>
<P>While I was in Cornwall, there were great &s;hipwrecks about the Land's-end. It was the cu&s;tom of that country at &s;uch a time, both rich and poor went out to get as much of the wreck as they could, not caring to &s;ave the people's lives; and in &s;ome parts of the country they called &s;hip|wrecks God's grace. It grieved my &s;pirit to hear of &s;uch un|chri&s;tian actions, con&s;idering how far they were below the heathen at Melita, who received Paul, made him a fire, and were courteous towards him, and tho&s;e that &s;uffered &s;hipwreck with him. Wherefore I was moved to write a paper, and &s;end it to all the pari&s;hes, prie&s;ts, and magi&s;|trates, to reprove them for &s;uch greedy actions, and to warn and exhort them that, if they could a&s;&s;i&s;t to &s;ave people's lives and pre&s;erve their &s;hips and goods, they &s;hould u&s;e their diligence therein; and con&s;ider, if it had been their own condition, they would judge it hard, if they &s;hould be upon a wreck and the people &s;hould &s;trive to get what they could from them, and not regard their lives.</P>

<P>TAKE heed of greedine&s;s and covetou&s;ne&s;s, for that is idolatry; and the idolater mu&s;t not enter into the
<PB N="391" REF="037441_0468_100D910BCAC20358">kingdom of God. Take heed of drunkenne&s;s, oaths, and cur&s;ings, for &s;uch are de&s;troyers of the creation, and make it to groan. Lay a&s;ide all fighting, quarrelling, brawling, and evil-&s;peaking, which are the works of the fle&s;h and not of the Spirit, for who follow &s;uch things are not like to inherit the kingdom of God. Put away all corrupt words, which are un&s;avoury, and mi&s;naming one another, for ye mu&s;t give an account for every idle word. Lay a&s;ide all profe&s;&s;ion and religion that is vain, and come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the pure religion, which is to vi&s;it the fa|therle&s;s, the widow, and the &s;tranger, and receive them, for &s;ome thereby may entertain angels or the &s;ervants of the Lord unawares, as Paul was entertained after the &s;hip|wreck at Melita. Do not take people's-goods from them by force out of their &s;hips, &s;eamen's or others, neither covet after them; but rather endeavour to pre&s;erve their lives and goods for them, for that &s;hews a &s;pirit of com|pa&s;&s;ion, and the &s;pirit of a chri&s;tian. But if ye be greedy and covetous after other men's goods, not mattering what becomes of the men, would ye be &s;erved &s;o your&s;elves? If ye &s;hould have a &s;hip ca&s;t away in other places, and the people &s;hould come to tear the goods and &s;hip in pieces, not regarding to &s;ave your lives, but be ready to fight one with another for your goods, do not ye believe &s;uch goods would become a cur&s;e to them? May ye not as &s;urely be|lieve &s;uch kind of actions will become a cur&s;e to you? When the &s;poil of one &s;hip's goods is idly &s;pent and con&s;u|med upon the lu&s;ts in alehou&s;es, taverns, and otherwi&s;e, then ye gape for another. Is this to <Q>do as ye would be done by;</Q> which is the law and the prophets? Prie&s;t Hull, are the&s;e thy fruits? What do&s;t thou take people's labour and goods for? Ha&s;t thou taught the people no better man|ners and conver&s;ation, who are &s;o bruti&s;h and heatheni&s;h? All &s;uch things we judge in whom&s;oever. But if any friend or others pre&s;erve men's lives, and endeavour to &s;ave their goods and e&s;tates, and re&s;tore what they can &s;ave of a wreck to the owners, if they con&s;ider them for their labour, doing in that ca&s;e unto them what they would have done to them&s;elves, that we approve. And if they buy or &s;ell, and do not make a prey, that is al|lowed of &s;till in the way of <Q>doing as ye would be done by,</Q> keeping to the law and to the prophets. If you &s;hould be wrecked in another country, ye would have other people &s;ave your lives and goods, and have your
<PB N="392" REF="037441_0469_100D910E4F864610">goods re&s;tored to you again, and you ought to con&s;ider them for &s;o doing. All that do otherwi&s;e, who wait for a wreck and take the goods for your&s;elves, not regarding the lives of the men, but if any e&s;cape drowning turn them a begging up and down the country, and if any e&s;cape with a little rob them of it, all that do &s;o are not for pre&s;erving the creation, but de&s;troying it: and tho&s;e goods which are &s;o got &s;hall be a cur&s;e, a plague, and a judgment to them, and the judgments of God will follow them for act|ing &s;uch things; the witne&s;s in your con&s;ciences &s;hall an|&s;wer it. Therefore, all ye who have done &s;uch things, "do &s;o no more," le&s;t a wor&s;e thing come unto you. But that which is good, do: pre&s;erve men's lives and e&s;tates, and labour to re&s;tore the lo&s;s and breach: that the Lord requires. Be not like a company of greedy dogs, and wor&s;e than heathens, as if ye had never heard of God, nor Chri&s;t, nor the &s;criptures, nor pure religion. And prie&s;t Hull, have people &s;pent their money upon thee for that which is no bread? for a thing of nought, that thou ha&s;t &s;uch fruits? All &s;uch teachers, that make a trade of the &s;criptures (which are given forth from the Spirit of God, to be believed, read, and practi&s;ed, and Chri&s;t, whom they te&s;tify of, enjoyed) we utterly deny; who own Chri&s;t, and are come off from your &s;teeple-hou&s;es, which were the old ma&s;s-hou&s;es; for there are the&s;e bad fruits harboured, tho&s;e are the cages of them. But come to the church which is in God (1 The&s;&s;. i.) and come all to the light which Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath enlightened you with, which &s;hews you all your ungodly words, ungodly thoughts, and ungodly actions. This will be your teacher if ye love it, your condemner if ye hate it. For the mighty day of the Lord is coming upon all wickedne&s;s and ungodline&s;s; therefore lay a&s;ide your whoredoms and fornications. And ye magi&s;trates, who are to do ju&s;tice, think ye not that the hand of the Lord is again&s;t you, and that his judgments will come upon you who do not look after the&s;e things, and &s;top them with the law, which is, <Q>To do unto all men as they would have done unto them,</Q> whereby ye might be a good &s;avour in your country? Is not the law to pre|&s;erve men's lives and e&s;tates, <Q>Doing unto all men as they would men &s;hould do unto them?</Q> For all men would have their lives and e&s;tates pre&s;erved; therefore, &s;hould not ye pre&s;erve others, and not &s;uffer them to be

<P>This paper had good &s;ervice among people: and friends have endeavoured much to &s;ave the lives of men in time of wrecks, and to pre&s;erve the &s;hips and goods for them. And when &s;ome, who &s;uffered &s;hipwreck, have been almo&s;t-dead and &s;tarved, friends have taken them to their hou&s;es to &s;uc|cour and recover them, which is an act to be practi&s;ed by all true chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>I had many precious, ble&s;&s;ed, living meetings in Corn|wall, &s;everal eminent people being convinced in that coun|ty, whom neither prie&s;ts nor magi&s;trates, by &s;poiling goods or impri&s;onments, could bring to for&s;ake their &s;hepherd, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who bought them; and friends who were turned to Chri&s;t, their Teacher and Saviour, being &s;ettled in peace and quietne&s;s upon him, their Foundation, we left them to the Lord's teaching and ordering, fre&s;h and green. Thomas Lower, who had accompanied me through that county, brought me over Hor&s;e-bridge into Devon&s;hire again; and after &s;everal meetings in Devon&s;hire we came to Somer&s;et&s;hire, where we had divers large and peaceable meetings, and vi&s;ited friends till we came to Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>I entered Bri&s;tol on a &s;eventh-day. The day before the &s;oldiers came into the meeting, and were exceeding rude, beating and &s;triking friends with their mu&s;kets, and drove them out of the orchard in a great rage, threatening what they would do if they came there again. For the mayor and the commander of the &s;oldiers had, if &s;eems, combined together to make a di&s;turbance among&s;t us. When friends told me what a rage there was in the town, how they were threatened by the mayor and &s;oldiers, and how unruly they
<PB N="394" REF="037441_0471_100D9112285C7D30">had been the day before, I &s;ent for George Bi&s;hop, Thomas Gouldney, Thomas Speed, and Edward Pyot, and de&s;ired them to go to the mayor and aldermen, and reque&s;t them, &s;eeing they had broke up our meetings, to let us have the town-hall to meet in; and for the u&s;e of it we would give them twenty pounds a year, to be di&s;tributed among&s;t the poor: and when the mayor and aldermen had bu&s;ine&s;s to do in it, friends would not meet in it, but only on the fir&s;t-days. Tho&s;e friends were a&s;toni&s;hed at this, and &s;aid, The mayor and aldermen would think they were mad. I &s;aid, Nay; for they &s;hould offer them a con&s;iderable benefit to the poor. And it was upon me from the Lord to bid them go. At la&s;t they con&s;ented, and went, though in the cro&s;s to their own wills. When they had laid the thing before the mayor, it came &s;o over him, that he &s;aid. <Q>For his part he could con&s;ent to it, but he was but one.</Q> He told them of another great hall they might have, but that they did not accept of, it being inconvenient. So they came away, leaving the mayor in a very loving frame towards them; for they felt the Lord's power had come over him. When they came back, I &s;poke to them to go to the colo|nel, and lay before him the rude carriage of his &s;oldiers, how they came armed among&s;t naked innocent people, who were waiting upon and wor&s;hipping the Lord; but they were backward to go to him. Next morning, being fir&s;t-day, we went to the meeting in the Orchard, where the &s;ol|diers had &s;o lately been &s;o rude. After I had declared the truth a pretty while in the meeting, there came in many rude &s;oldiers and people, &s;ome with drawn &s;words. The innkeepers had made &s;ome of them drunk; and one of them had bound him&s;elf with an oath, <Q>to cut down and kill the man that &s;poke.</Q> He came pre&s;&s;ing in through the crowd to within two yards of me, and &s;topped at tho&s;e four friends before-mentioned (who &s;hould have gone to the colonel as I would have had them) and fell a jangling with them. On a &s;udden I &s;aw his &s;word was put up and gone; for the Lord's power came over all, and chained him with the re&s;t. We had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting, for the Lord's everla&s;ting power and pre&s;ence was felt among&s;t us. The day follow|ing tho&s;e four friends went and &s;poke with the colonel, and he &s;ent for the &s;oldiers, and cut and &s;la&s;hed &s;ome of them before the friends faces. Which when I heard of I blamed them for letting him do &s;o, and al&s;o for not going on the &s;eventh-day as I would have had them. Which might have
<PB N="395" REF="037441_0472_100D7F74417BB320">prevented this cutting of the &s;oldiers, and the trouble they gave at our meeting. Thus the Lord's power came over all tho&s;e per&s;ecuting, bloody minds, and the meeting was held in peace for a good while after.</P>
<P>I had then al&s;o a general meeting at Edward Pyot's near Bri&s;tol, at which it was judged were &s;everal thou&s;ands of people; for be&s;ides friends from many parts thereabouts, &s;ome of the Bapti&s;ts and Independents, with their teachers, came to it, and many of the &s;ober people of Bri&s;tol; in|&s;omuch that the people who &s;taid behind &s;aid, <Q>The city looked naked.</Q> &s;o many were gone out of it to this meet|ing. It was very quiet, many glorious truths were opened to the people, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was &s;et up, who is the end of all figures and &s;hadows, of the law and the fir&s;t covenant. It was declared to the people, that all figures and &s;hadows were given to man after man fell, and that all the rudiments and inventions of men which have been &s;et up in Chri&s;tendom, many of which were Jewi&s;h and heatheni&s;h, were not &s;et up by the command of Chri&s;t; and all images and likene&s;&s;es man has made to him&s;elf or for him&s;elf, whether of things in heaven or things in earth, have been &s;ince he lo&s;t the image and likene&s;s of God, which God made him in. But now Chri&s;t is come to redeem, tran&s;late, convert, and regenerate man out of all the&s;e things that he hath &s;et up in the fall, out of the true types, figures and &s;hadows al&s;o, and out of death and darkne&s;s, up into the light, life, and image of God again, which man and woman were in before they fell. Therefore all now &s;hould come, and all may come to receive Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the &s;ub|&s;tance, by his light, &s;pirit, grace and faith, and &s;hould live and walk in him, the Redeemer and Saviour.</P>
<P>And as we had a great deal of work with prie&s;ts and pro|fe&s;&s;ors, who pleaded for imperfection, I was opened to de|clare and manife&s;t to them that Adam and Eve were perfect before they fell, and all that God made he &s;aw was good, and he ble&s;&s;ed it; but the imperfection came in by the fall, through man's and woman's hearkening to the devil who was out of truth. And though the law made nothing perfect, yet it made way for the bringing in of the better hope, which hope is Chri&s;t, who de&s;troys the devil and his works, which made man and woman imperfect. Chri&s;t &s;aith to his di&s;ci|ples, <Q>Be ye perfect, even as your heavenly Father is per|fect:</Q> and he, who him&s;elf was perfect, comes to make man and woman perfect again and brings them again to the
<PB N="396" REF="037441_0473_100D9116754B8248">&s;tate which God made them in. So he is the maker up of the breach, and the peace betwixt God and man. That this might the better be under&s;tood by the lowe&s;t capacities, I u&s;ed a compari&s;on of two old people who had their hou&s;e broken down by an enemy, &s;o that they, with all their chil|dren, were liable to all &s;torms and tempe&s;ts. And there came &s;ome to them that pretended to be workmen, and of|fered to build up their hou&s;e again, if they would give them &s;o much a year; but when they had got their money they left their hou&s;e as they found it. After this manner came a &s;econd, third, fourth, fifth, and &s;ixth, each with his &s;eve|ral pretence to build up the old hou&s;e, and each got the people's money, and then cried, <Q>They could not rear up the hou&s;e, the breach could not be made up; for there is no perfection here.</Q> They tell them, the hou&s;e can never be perfectly built up again in this life, though they have taken the people's money for doing it. For all the &s;ect|ma&s;ters in chri&s;tendom (&s;o called) have pretended to build up Adam's and Eve's fallen hou&s;e, and when they have got people's money, tell them the work cannot be perfectly done here; &s;o their hou&s;e lies as it did. But I told the people, Chri&s;t was come to do it freely, who by one offer|ing hath perfected for ever all them that are &s;anctified, and renews them up into the image of God, which man and woman were in before they fell, and makes man's and woman's hou&s;e as perfect again as God made them at the fir&s;t; and this Chri&s;t, the heavenly Man, doth freely. Therefore all are to look unto him, and all that have re|ceived him are to walk in him, the Life, the Sub&s;tance, the Fir&s;t, and the La&s;t, <Q>The Rock of Ages, the Founda|tion of many Generations.</Q> Largely were the&s;e and ma|ny other things opened to people, the word of life was preached, which lives and abides, and all were exhorted to hear and obey it, that by it all might be born again of the immortal &s;eed, and feed of the milk of the word. A glo|rious meeting there was, wherein the Lord's everla&s;ting &s;eed, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, was &s;et over all, and friends parted in the power and Spirit of the Lord, in peace, and in his truth, that is over all.</P>
<P>About this time the &s;oldiers under general Monk's com|mand were rude and trouble&s;ome at friends meetings in many places, whereof complaint being made to him, he gave forth the following order, which &s;omewhat re&s;trained them:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After this meeting, I pa&s;&s;ed to Olde&s;ton, to Nail&s;worth, and to Nathaniel Cri&s;p's; where was a large meeting, and &s;everal &s;oldiers, but quiet. From thence we pa&s;&s;ed to Glouce&s;ter, vi&s;iting meetings. In Glouce&s;ter we had one that was peaceable, though the town was very rude and divided; for one part of the &s;oldiers were for the king, and another for the parliament. As I pa&s;&s;ed out of the town over the bridge, Edward Pyot being with me, the &s;oldiers there &s;aid, 'They were for the king.' After we were pa&s;t them, they were in a great rage that I had e&s;caped them, and &s;aid, <Q>Had they known it they would have &s;hot me with hail-&s;hot rather than I &s;hould have e&s;caped.</Q> But the Lord prevented their devili&s;h de&s;ign, and brought me &s;afe to colonel Grimes's, where we had a large general meeting, and the Lord's truth and power was &s;et over all; friends were e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the Rock, and &s;ettled under the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t's teaching.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed from thence to Tewk&s;bury, and &s;o to Wor|ce&s;ter, vi&s;iting meetings as we went. And in all my time I never &s;aw the like drunkenne&s;s as then in the towns; for they had been choo&s;ing parliament-men. At Worce&s;ter the Lord's truth was &s;et over all, people were finely &s;ettled therein, and friends prai&s;ed the Lord; nay, I &s;aw the very earth rejoiced. Yet great fears and troubles were in many, looking for the king's coming in, and that all things &s;hould be altered. They would a&s;k me what I thought of times and things? I told them the Lord's power was over all, his light &s;hined over all, and that fear would take hold only on the hypocrites, &s;uch as had not been faithful to God, and on our per&s;ecutors. In my travail and &s;ufferings at Reading, when people were at a &s;tand, and could not tell who might rule, I told them the Lord's power was over all (for I travelled through in it) and his day &s;hined who&s;oever &s;hould come in, and whether the king came in or no, all would be well to them that loved the Lord, and were faith|ful
<PB N="398" REF="037441_0475_100D9119F363A7A8">to him. Therefore I bid all friends fear none but the Lord, and keep in his power that was over all.</P>
<P>From Worce&s;ter I vi&s;ited friends meetings till I came to Badgely; from thence I went to Drayton, in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, to vi&s;it my relations. While I was there, one Burton, a ju&s;tice, hearing I had a good hor&s;e, &s;ent a warrant to &s;earch for me and my hor&s;e; but I was gone before they came, &s;o he mi&s;&s;ed of his wicked end. I pa&s;&s;ed to Twycro&s;s, Swan|ington, and Derby, where I vi&s;ited friends, and found my old gaoler among&s;t them, who had formerly kept me in the hou&s;e of correction there, who was now convinced of the truth which I then &s;uffered under him for. Pa&s;&s;ing into Derby&s;hire and Nottingham&s;hire, I came to Synderhill|green, vi&s;iting friends meetings; and &s;o to Balby in York|&s;hire, where our yearly meeting at that time was held, in a great orchard of John Killam's, where it was &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ome thou&s;ands of people and friends were gathered together. In the morning I heard a troop of hor&s;e was &s;ent from York, about thirty miles off, to break up our meeting, and that the militia newly rai&s;ed was to join them. I went into the meeting, and &s;tood up on a great &s;tool; and after I had &s;poken &s;ome time, two trumpeters came, &s;ounding their trumpets pretty near me, and the captain of the troop cried, 'Divide to the right and left, and make way.' Then they rode up to me. I was declaring the everla&s;ting truth and word of life, in the mighty power of the Lord. The captain bid me <Q>Come down, for he was come to di&s;per&s;e our meeting.</Q> After &s;ome time I told him, they all knew we were a peaceable people, and that we u&s;ed to have &s;uch great meetings; but if he apprehended we met in an ho&s;tile way, I de&s;ired him to make &s;earch among us, and if he found either &s;word or pi&s;tol about any there, let &s;uch &s;uffer. He told me, <Q>He mu&s;t &s;ee us di&s;per&s;ed, for he came all night on purpo&s;e to di&s;per&s;e us.</Q> I a&s;ked him, What honour it would be to him to ride with &s;words and pi&s;tols among&s;t &s;o m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny unarmed men and women as there were?

Then he went away with his troop, and friends of the hou&s;e gave the &s;oldiers that &s;taid, and their hor&s;es, &s;ome meat. When the captain was gone, the &s;oldiers that were left told us, <Q>We might &s;tay till night if we would.</Q> But we &s;taid but about three hours after, and had a glorious, powerful meeting; for the pre&s;ence of the living God was manife&s;t among&s;t us, and the &s;eed, Chri&s;t, was &s;et over all. Friends were built upon him the foundation, and &s;ettled under his glorious, heaven|ly teaching. After the meeting friends pa&s;&s;ed away in peace, greatly refre&s;hed with the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and filled with joy and gladne&s;s that the Lord's power had given them &s;uch dominion. Many of the militia-&s;oldiers &s;taid al&s;o, much vexed that the captain and troopers had not broke up our meeting, and cur&s;ed the captain and his troopers. It was reported they intended evil again&s;t us that day; but the troopers, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, were rather a&s;&s;i&s;tant to us, in not joining them as they expected, but prevent|ing them from doing the mi&s;chief they de&s;igned. Yet this captain was a de&s;perate man; for it was he that &s;aid to me in Scotland, <Q>He would obey his &s;uperior's commands, if it was to crucify Chri&s;t he would do it, or execute the great Turk's commands again&s;t the chri&s;tians if he was under him.</Q> So that it was an eminent power of the Lord, which chained both him and his troopers, and tho&s;e envious militia-&s;oldiers al&s;o, who went away, not having power to hurt any of us, nor to break up our meeting.</P>
<P>Next day we had an heavenly meeting at Warm&s;worth of friends in the mini&s;try, with &s;everal others; and then friends parted. As they pa&s;&s;ed through the country &s;everal were taken up; for the day that our fir&s;t meeting was held on, Lambert was routed, and it made great confu&s;ion in the country; but friends were not kept long in pri&s;on at that time. As I went to this meeting there came &s;everal to me at Skegby in Nottingham&s;hire, who were going to be &s;ol|diers under Lambert, and would have bought my hor&s;e of me; and becau&s;e I would not &s;ell him, they were in a great rage again&s;t me, u&s;ing many threatening words: but I told them, 'God would confound and &s;catter them;' and within two or three days after they were &s;cattered indeed.</P>
<P>From Warm&s;worth I pa&s;&s;ed, in the Lord's power, to
<PB N="400" REF="037441_0477_100D911E07FB26E0">Barton-abby, where I had a great meeting; from thence to Thomas Taylor's, and &s;o to Skipton, where was a gene|ral meeting of men friends out of many counties concerning the affairs of the church. <Q>A friend went naked through the town, declaring truth, and was much beaten. Some other friends al&s;o came to me all bloody.</Q> As I wakled in the &s;treet, a de&s;perate fellow had an intent to have done me mi&s;chief; but he was prevented, and our meeting was qui|et. To this meeting came many friends out of mo&s;t parts of the nation; for it was about bu&s;ine&s;s relating to the church both in this nation and beyond the &s;eas. Several years before, when I was in the north, I was moved to recommend to friends the &s;etting up of this meeting for that &s;ervice; for many friends &s;uffered in divers parts of the nation, their goods were taken from them contrary to law, and they under&s;tood not how to help them&s;elves, or where to &s;eek redre&s;s. But after this meeting was &s;et up, &s;everal friends who had been magi&s;trates, and others who under|&s;tood &s;omething of the law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e thither, and were able to inform friends, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in gathering up the &s;uffer|ings, that they might be laid before the ju&s;tices, judges, or parliament. This meeting had &s;tood &s;everal years, and divers ju&s;tices and captains had come to break it up, but when they under&s;tood the bu&s;ine&s;s friends met about, and &s;aw friends books, and accounts of collections for relief of the poor, how we took care one county to help another, and to help our friends beyond &s;ea, and provide for our poor that none of them &s;hould be chargeable to their pa|ri&s;hes, &amp;c. the ju&s;tlices and officers confe&s;&s;ed that we did their work, and would pa&s;s away peaceably and lovingly, 'commending friends practice.' Sometimes there would come two hundred of the poor of other people, and wait till the meeting was done (for all the country knew we met about the poor) and after the meeting friends would &s;end to the bakers for bread, and give every one of tho&s;e poor people a loaf, how many &s;oever there were of them; for we were taught <Q>to do good unto all, though e&s;pecially to the hou&s;ehold of &s;aith.</Q></P>
<P>After this meeting, I vi&s;ited friends meeting till I came to Lanca&s;ter; from whence I went to Robert Withers's, and &s;o to Arn&s;ide, where I had a general meeting for all the friends in the counties of We&s;tmoreland, Cumberland, and Lanca&s;hire. This meeting was quiet and peaceable, and the living pre&s;ence of the Lord was among&s;t us. I went
<PB N="401" REF="037441_0478_100D91204D96FD18">back with Robert Withers, and friends pa&s;&s;ed away, fre&s;h in the life and power of Chri&s;t, in which they had domi|nion, being &s;ettled upon him the Heavenly Rock and Foun|dation. Several rude fellows, &s;erving-men belonging to Sir George Middleton, a ju&s;tice, that lived not far off, came to have made &s;ome di&s;turbance, as it was thought; but the meeting being ended they did nothing there: but lighting on three women friends going homeward, they &s;et upon them with impudent &s;coffs, and one of them carried him|&s;elf very abu&s;ively and immode&s;tly towards them. The &s;ame man abu&s;ed other friends al&s;o, and was &s;o outrageous that he would have cut &s;ome with an ax, but that the was re&s;trained by &s;ome of his fellows. At another time the &s;ame man &s;et upon &s;ix friends that were going to a meeting at Yelland, and beat and abu&s;ed them &s;o, that he <Q>brui&s;ed their faces and &s;hed much of their blood,</Q> wounding them very &s;ore, and one of them in &s;everal parts of his body; yet they lifted not an hand again&s;t him, but gave him their backs and cheeks to beat.</P>
<P>From Robert Withers's I went next day to Swarthmore, Francis Howgil and Thomas Curtis being with me. I had not been long there before Henry Porter, a ju&s;tice, &s;ent a warrant by the chief con&s;table and three petty con&s;tables to apprehend me. I had a &s;en&s;e of the thing beforehand; and being in the parlour with Richard Richard&s;on and Marga|ret Fell, &s;ome of her &s;ervants came and told her, there were &s;ome come to &s;earch the hou&s;e for arms, and they went up into &s;ome of the chambers under that pretence. It came upon me to go out to them, and as I was going by &s;ome of them, I &s;poke to them; whereupon they a&s;ked me my name. I readily told them my name, and they laid hold on me, &s;aying, I was the man they looked for, and led me away to Ulver&s;tone. There they kept me all night at the con&s;table's, and &s;et a guard of fi&s;teen or &s;ixteen men to watch me; &s;ome of whom &s;ate in the chimney, for fear I &s;hould go up the chimney: &s;uch dark imaginations po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them. They were very rude and uncivil to me, and would neither &s;uffer me to &s;peak to friends nor friends to bring me nece&s;&s;aries; but with violence thru&s;t them out, and kept a &s;trong guard upon me. Very wicked and rude they were, and a great noi&s;e they made about me. One of the con&s;ta|bles, who&s;e name was A&s;hburnham, &s;aid, <Q>He did not think a thou&s;and men could have taken me.</Q> Another of the con&s;tables, who&s;e name was Mount, a very wicked man,
<PB N="402" REF="037441_0479_100D91580565D600">&s;aid, <Q>He would have &s;erved judge Fell him&s;elf &s;o, if he had been alive, and he had a warrant for him.</Q> Next morning, about the &s;ixth hour, I was putting on my boots and &s;purs to go with them before &s;ome ju&s;tice; but they pulled off my &s;purs, took my knife out of my pocket, and ha&s;ted me away along the town, with a party of hor&s;e and abundance of people, not &s;uffering me to &s;tay till my own hor&s;e came down. When I was gone about a quarter of a mile with them, &s;ome friends, with Margaret Fell and her children, came towards me, and then a great party of hor&s;e gathered about me in a mad rage and fury, crying out, 'Will they re&s;cue him! will they re&s;cue him!' Where|upon I &s;aid, <Q>Here is my hair, here is my back, here are my cheeks, &s;trike on!</Q> Upon which their heat was a little a&s;&s;uaged. Then they brought a little hor&s;e, and two of them took up one of my legs, and put my foot in the &s;tir|rup, and two or three lifting over my other leg, &s;et me upon the little hor&s;e, behind the &s;addle, and &s;o led the hor&s;e by the halter, but I had nothing to hold by. When they were come a pretty way out of the town, they beat the little hor&s;e, and made him kick and gallop; whereupon I &s;lipped off him, and told them, <Q>They &s;hould not abu&s;e the creature.</Q> They were much enraged at my getting off, and took me by the legs and feet, and &s;et me upon the &s;ame hor&s;e behind the &s;addle again, and led the hor&s;e about two miles, till we came to a great water called Carter-ford. By this time my own hor&s;e was come to us, and the water being deep, and their little hor&s;e &s;carce able to carry me through, they let me get upon my own hor&s;e through the per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;ome of their own company, they leading him through the water. One wicked fellow <Q>kneeled down, and lifting up his hands ble&s;&s;ed God that I was taken.</Q> When I was come over the &s;ands, I told them I had heard I had liberty to choo&s;e what ju&s;tice I would go before; but the con&s;tables cried, 'No, I &s;hould not.' They led me to Lanca&s;ter, about fourteen miles, and a great triumph they thought to have had; but as they led me I was moved to <Q>&s;ing prai&s;es to the Lord, in his triumphing power over all.</Q> When I was come to Lanca&s;ter, the &s;pirits of the people being mightily up, I &s;tood and looked earne&s;tly upon them, and they cried, 'Look at his eyes!' After a while I &s;poke to them, and they were pretty &s;ober. Then came a young man who took me to his hou&s;e, and after a little time the officers had me to major Porter's, the ju&s;tice
<PB N="403" REF="037441_0480_100D7F8F85999800">who had &s;ent the warrant again&s;t me, who had &s;everal others with him. When I came in, I &s;aid, <Q>Peace be among&s;t you.</Q> Porter a&s;ked me, <Q>Why I came into the country that trouble&s;ome time?</Q> I told him, 'To vi&s;it my bre|thren.' But &s;aid he, <Q>You have great meetings up and down.</Q> I told him though we had, our meetings were known throughout the nation to be peaceable, and we were a peaceable people. He &s;aid, <Q>We &s;aw the devil in peo|ple's faces.</Q> I told him, <Q>If I &s;aw a drunkard, or a &s;wear|er, or a peevi&s;h heady man, J could not &s;ay I &s;aw the Spirit of God in him.</Q> And I a&s;ked him, <Q>If he could &s;ee the Spirit of God?</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>We cried again&s;t their mini&s;ters.</Q> I told him, While we were as Saul, &s;itting under the prie&s;ts, and running up and down with their packets of letters, we were never called pe&s;tilent fellows nor makers of &s;ects; but when we were come to exerci&s;e our con&s;ciences towards God and man, we were called pe&s;tilent fellows, as Paul was. He &s;aid, We could expre&s;s our&s;elves well enough, and he would not di&s;pute with me; but he would re&s;train me. I de&s;ired to know, <Q>for what, and by who&s;e order he &s;ent his warrant for me;</Q> and complained to him of the abu&s;e of the con&s;tables and other officers after they had taken me, and in their bringing me thither. He would not take notice of that, but told me, <Q>He had an orden but would not let me &s;ee it; for he would not re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">al the king's &s;ecrets;</Q> and be&s;ides, 'a pri&s;oner,' he &s;aid, 'was not to &s;ee for what he was committed.' I told him, that was not rea&s;on: for how &s;hould he make his defence then? I &s;aid I ought to have a copy of it. But he &s;aid, There was a judge once, <Q>that fined one for letting a pri|&s;oner have a copy of his mittimus; and,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I have an old clerk, though I am a young ju&s;tice.</Q> Then he called to his clerk, &s;aying, 'Is it not ready yet? Bring it;' meaning the mittimus. But it not being ready, he told me I was a di&s;turber of the nation. I told him, I had been a ble&s;&s;ing to the nation, in and through the Lord's power and truth, and the Spirit of God in all con&s;ciences would an&s;wer it. Then he charged me as an <Q>enemy to the king, that I en|deavoured to rai&s;e a new war, and imbrue the nation in blood again.</Q> I told him, I had never learned the po&s;tures of war, but was clear and innocent as a child con|cerning tho&s;e things; and therefore was bold. Then came the clerk with the mittimus, and the gaoler was &s;ent for and commanded to take me, put me into the Dark-hou&s;e, and
<PB N="404" REF="037441_0481_100D7F9113688568">let none come at me, but keep me there clo&s;e pri&s;oner till I &s;hould be delivered by the king or parliament. Then the ju&s;tice a&s;ked the con&s;tables where my hor&s;e was? <Q>For I hear,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>he hath a good hor&s;e; have ye brought his hor&s;e?</Q> I told him where my hor&s;e was, but he did not meddle with him. As they had me to the gaol the con&s;table gave me my knife again, and then a&s;ked me to give it him: I told him, Nay; he had not been &s;o civil to me. So they put me into the gaol, and the under-gaoler, one Hardy, a very wicked man, was exceeding rude and cruel, and many times would not let me have meat brought in, but as I could get it under the door. Many came to look at me, &s;ome in a rage, and very uncivil and rude. One time there came two young prie&s;ts, and very abu&s;ive they were; the meane&s;t people could not be wor&s;e. A|mong&s;t tho&s;e that came in this manner, old Pre&s;ton's wife of Howker was one. She u&s;ed many abu&s;ive words to me, telling me, my 'tongue &s;hould be cut out,' and that <Q>I &s;hould be hanged;</Q> &s;hewing me the gallows. But the Lord God cut her off, and &s;he died in a mi&s;erable condition.</P>
<P>Being clo&s;e pri&s;oner in the common gaol at Lanca&s;ter, I de&s;ired Thomas Cummins and Thomas Green to go to the gaoler, and de&s;ire a copy of my mittimus, that I might know what I &s;tood committed for. They went; and the gaoler an&s;wered,<Q>He could not give a copy of it, for an|other had been fined for &s;o doing;</Q> but he gave them liberty to read it over. To the be&s;t of their remembrance, the matters therein charged again&s;t me were, <Q>That I was a per&s;on generally &s;u&s;pected to be a common di&s;turber of 'the peace of the nation, an enemy to the king, and a chief upholder of the Quakers &s;ect; and that I, together with many of my fanatick opinion, have of late endeavoured to rai&s;e in&s;urrections in the&s;e parts of the country, and embroil the whole country in blood. Wherefore the gaol|er was commanded to keep me in &s;afe cu&s;tody, till I &s;hould be relea&s;ed by order from the king or parliament.</Q></P>
<P>When I had thus got the heads of the charge contained in the mittimus, I wrote a plain, downright an&s;wer, in vin|dication of my innocency to each particular, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I AM a pri&s;oner at Lanca&s;ter, committed by ju&s;tice Porter. A copy of the mittimus I cannot get; but &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions I am told are in it as are very untrue. As that I am <Q>generally &s;u&s;pected to be a common di&s;|turber
<PB N="405" REF="037441_0482_100D7FBA03D46090">of the nation's peace, an enemy to the king, and that I, with others, &s;hould endeavour to rai&s;e in&s;urrec|tions, to embroil the nation in blood.</Q> All which is u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|terly fal&s;e; and I do, in every part thereof, deny it. For I am not a per&s;on generally &s;u&s;pected to be a di&s;turber of the nation's peace, nor have given any cau&s;e for &s;uch &s;u&s;|picion; for through the nation I have been tried for the&s;e things formerly. In the days of Oliver I was taken up on pretence of rai&s;ing arms again&s;t him, which was al&s;o fal&s;e; for I meddled not with rai&s;ing arms at all. Yet I was then carried up pri&s;oner to London, and brought before him; when I cleared my&s;elf, and denied the drawing of a carnal weapon again&s;t him, or any man upon the earth; for my weapons are &s;piritual, which take away the occa|&s;ion of war, and lead into peace. Upon my declaring this to Oliver, I was &s;et at liberty by him. After this I was taken, and &s;ent to pri&s;on by major Ceely, in Corn|wall, who, when I was brought before the judge, informed again&s;t me, <Q>That I took him a&s;ide, and told him, that I could rai&s;e forty thou&s;and men in an hour's time to in|volve the nation in blood, and bring in king Charles.</Q> This al&s;o was utterly fal&s;e, a lie of his own inventing, as was then proved upon him; for I never &s;poke any &s;uch word to him. I never was in any plot, I never took any engagement or oath, nor ever learned war-po&s;ture. As tho&s;e were fal&s;e charges again&s;t me then, &s;o are the&s;e now which come from major Porter, who is lately appointed to be ju&s;tice, but wanted power formerly to exerci&s;e his cruelty again&s;t us; which is but the wickedne&s;s of the old enemy. For the peace of the nation I am not a di&s;turber of, nor ever was; but &s;eek the peace thereof, and of all men, and &s;tand for all nations peace and men's peace upon the earth, and wi&s;h that all nations and men knew my in|nocency in the&s;e things.</P>
<P>And whereas major Porter &s;aith, I am an <Q>enemy to the king,</Q> this is fal&s;e; for my love is to <Q>him and to all men.</Q> even though they be enemies to God, to them|&s;elves, and me. And I can &s;ay, It is of the Lord that he is come in, to bring down many unrighteou&s;ly &s;et up; of which I had a fight three years before he came in. It is much he &s;hould &s;ay I am an enemy to the king; for I have no rea&s;on &s;o to be, he having done nothing again&s;t me. But I have been often impri&s;oned and per&s;ecuted the&s;e eleven or twelve years by tho&s;e that have been both
<PB N="406" REF="037441_0483_100D7FD3936316C8">again&s;t the king and his father, even the party that Porter was made a major by and bore arms for; but not by them that were for the king. I was never an enemy to the king, nor to any man's per&s;on upon the earth. I am in the love that fulfils the law, which thinks no evil, but loves even enemies; and would have the king &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, and be brought into the fear of the Lord, to receive his wi&s;dom from above, by which all things were made and created; that with that wi&s;dom he may order all things to the glory of God.</P>
<P>Whereas he calleth me, <Q>A chief upholder of the Quaker's &s;ect,</Q> I an&s;wer: the Quakers are not a &s;ect, but are in the power of God, which was before &s;ects were, and witne&s;s the election before the world began, and are come to live in the life which the prophets and apo&s;tles lived in who gave forth the &s;criptures; therefore are we hated by envious, wrathful, wicked, per&s;ecuting men. But God is the upholder of us all by his mighty power, and pre&s;erves us from the wrath of the wicked that would &s;wallow us up.</P>
<P>And whereas the &s;aith, <Q>That I, together with others of my fanatick opinion,</Q> as he calls it, <Q>have of late en|deavoured to rai&s;e in&s;urrections, and to embroil the whole kingdom in blood:</Q> This is altogether fal&s;e; to the&s;e things I am as a child, and know nothing of them. The po&s;tures of war I never learned; my weapons are &s;piritual and not carnal, for with carnal weapons I do not fight. I am a follower of him who &s;aid, <Q>My kingdom is not of this world.</Q> And though the&s;e lies and &s;landers are rai&s;ed upon me, I deny drawing of any carnal weapon again&s;t the king or parliament, or any man upon the earth; for I am come to the end of the law, <Q>to love enemies, and wre&s;tle not with fle&s;h and blood;</Q> but am in that which &s;aves men's lives. A witne&s;s I am again&s;t all murderers, plotters, and all &s;uch as would "imbrue the nation in blood; for it is not in my heart to have any man's life de&s;troyed. And as for the word fanatick, which &s;ignifies furious, fooli&s;h, mad, &amp;c. he might have con&s;i|dered him&s;elf before he had u&s;ed that word, and have learned the humility which goes before honour. We are not turious, fooli&s;h, or mad; but through patience and meekne&s;s have borne lies, &s;landers, and per&s;ecutions ma|ny years, and have undergone great &s;ufferings. The &s;pi|ritual man, that wre&s;tles not with fle&s;h and blood, and the
<PB N="407" REF="037441_0484_100D7FD518DB3478">Spirit that reproves &s;in in the gate, which is the Spirit of truth, wi&s;dom, and &s;ound judgment, is not mad, fooli&s;h furious, which fanatick &s;ignifies; but all are of a mad, fu|rious, fooli&s;h &s;pirit, that wre&s;tle with fle&s;h and blood, with carnal weapons, in their furiou&s;ne&s;s, fooli&s;hne&s;s, and rage. This is not the Spirit of God, but of error, that per&s;ecutes in a mad, blind, zeal, like Nebuchadnezzar and Saul.</P>
<P>Ina&s;much as I am ordered to be kept pri&s;oner till I be delivered by order from the king or parliament, therefore I have written the&s;e things to be laid before you, the king and parliament, that ye may con&s;ider of them before ye act any thing therein; that ye may weigh, in the wi&s;dom of God, the intent and end of men's &s;pirits, le&s;t ye act the thing that will bring the hand of the Lord upon you and again&s;t you, as many have done before you who have been in authority, whom God hath overthrown. In him we tru&s;t whom we fear and cry unto day and night, who hath heard us, doth hear us, and will hear us, and avenge our cau&s;e. Much innocent blood hath been &s;hed. Many have been per&s;ecuted to death by &s;uch as were in authority before you, whom God hath vomited out becau&s;e they turned again&s;t the ju&s;t. Therefore con&s;ider your &s;tanding now that ye have the day, and receive this as a warning of love to you.</P>

<P>I DO inform the governors of this nation, that Henry Porter, mayor of Lanca&s;ter, &s;ent a warrant with four con&s;tables to my hou&s;e, for which he had no authority nor order. They &s;earched my hou&s;e, and apprehended George Fox in it, who was not guilty of the breach of any law, or of any offence again&s;t any in the nation. After they had taken him and brought him before the &s;aid Henry Porter, bail
<PB N="408" REF="037441_0485_100D9121DDB42040">was offered what he would demand for his appearance, to an&s;wer what could be laid to his charge; but he (contrary to law, if he had taken him lawfully) denied to accept of any bail, and clapped him up in clo&s;e pri&s;on.

<P>After this Margaret Fell determined to go to London to &s;peak with the king about my being taken, to &s;hew him the manner of it, and the unju&s;t dealing and evil u&s;age I had received. Which when ju&s;tice Porter heard of, he vapour|ed that he would go and meet her in the gap. But when he came before the king, he having been a zealous man for the parliament again&s;t the king, &s;everal courtiers &s;poke to him concerning his plundering their hou&s;es; &s;o he had quickly enough of the court, and returned into the country. Meanwhile the gaoler &s;eemed very fearful, and &s;aid, He was afraid major Porter would hang him becau&s;e he had not put me in the Dark-hou&s;e. But when the gaoler went to wait on him, after he was come from London, he was very blank and down, and a&s;ked 'how I did?' pretending he would find a way to &s;et me at liberty. But having over&s;hot him&s;elf in his mittimus, by ordering me <Q>to be kept pri&s;oner till I &s;hould be delivered by the king or parliament,</Q>he had put it out of his power to relea&s;e me if he would. He was the more dejected al&s;o upon reading a letter which I &s;ent him; for when he was in the height of his rage and threats again&s;t me, and thought to ingratiate him&s;elf into the king's favour by impri&s;oning me, I was moved to write to him, and put him in mind, <Q>How fierce he had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">&s;t the king and his party, though now he would be thought zealous for the king.</Q> Among other pa&s;&s;ages in my letter, I called to his remembrance, that when he held Lanca&s;ter ca&s;tle for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">liament again&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng he was &s;o rough and frience again&s;t tho&s;e that favoured
<PB N="409" REF="037441_0486_100D91236DDF7050">the king, that he &s;aid, <Q>He wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld leave them neither dog nor cat if they did not bring him provi&s;ion to his ca&s;tle. I a&s;ked him al&s;o, Who&s;e great buck's horns tho&s;e were that were in his hou&s;e? and where he had them and the wain&s;cot that he cieled his hou&s;e withal? Had he not them from Hornby ca&s;tle?</Q></P>
<P>About this time Ann Curtis, of Reading, came to &s;ee me; and under&s;tanding how I &s;tood committed, it was upon her al&s;o to go to the king about it. Her father, who had been &s;heriff of Bri&s;tol, was hanged near his own door for endeavouring to bring the king in; upon which con&s;i|deration &s;he had &s;ome hopes the king might hear her on my behalf. Accordingly, when &s;he returned to London, &s;he and Margaret Fell went to the king together; who, when he under&s;tood who&s;e daughter &s;he was, received her kindly. And her reque&s;t to him being <Q>to &s;end for me up, and hear the cau&s;e him&s;elf,</Q> he promi&s;ed her he would, and commanded his &s;ecretary to &s;end an order for bringing me up. But when they came to the &s;ecretary for the or|der, he &s;aid, <Q>It was not in his power; he mu&s;t go accord|ing to law; and I mu&s;t be brought up by an Habeas Corpus before the judges.</Q> So he wrote to the judge of the king's bench, &s;ignifying it was the king's plea&s;ure I &s;hould be &s;ent up by an Habeas Corpus. Accordingly a writ was &s;ent, and delivered to the &s;heriff; but becau&s;se it was directed to the chancellor of Lanca&s;ter, the &s;heriff put it off to him; on the other hand the chancellor would not make the warrant upon it, but &s;aid the &s;heriff mu&s;t do that. At length both chancellor and &s;heriff were got together; but being both enemies to truth they &s;ought occa&s;ion for delay, and found an error in the writ, which was, that be|ing directed to the chancellor, it &s;aid, <Q>George Fox in pri&s;on under YOUR cu&s;tody,</Q> whereas the pri&s;on I was in was not in the chancellor's cu&s;tody, but the &s;heriff's; &s;o the word YOUR &s;hould have been HIS. Upon this they returned the writ to London again, only to have that one word altered. When it was altered and brought down again, the &s;heriff refu&s;ed to carry me up, unle&s;s I would &s;eal a writing to him, and become bound to pay for the &s;ealing and the charge of carrying me up: which I denied, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing them, I would not &s;eal any thing to them, nor be bound. So the matter re&s;ted awhile, and I continued in pri&s;on. Meanwhile the a&s;&s;ize came on; but as there was a writ for removing me up, I was not brought before the
<PB N="410" REF="037441_0487_100D9125ECAB39F8">judge. At the a&s;&s;ize many came to &s;ee me. I was moved to &s;peak out of the gaol-window to them, and &s;hew them, <Q>How uncertain their religion was, and that every &s;ort, when uppermo&s;t, had per&s;ecuted the re&s;t. When popery was uppermo&s;t, people had been per&s;ecuted for not fol|lowing the ma&s;s; and tho&s;e who held it up cried, <Q>It was the higher power,</Q> and people mu&s;t be &s;ubject to the higher power. Afterwards they that &s;et up the Common Prayer per&s;ecuted others for not following that; &s;aying, "It was the higher power, and we mu&s;t be &s;ubject to that." Since that, the Pre&s;byterians and Independents cried each of them, <Q>We mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be &s;ubject to the higher power, and &s;ubmit to the directory of the one and the church faith of the other.</Q> Thus all, like the apo&s;tate Jews, have cried, "Help, men of I&s;rael, again&s;t the true Chri&s;tians." So people might &s;ee how uncertain they are of their religions. But I directed them to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that they might be built upon him, the Rock and Foundation, that changeth not.</Q> Much on this wi&s;e I declared to them, and they were quiet and very attentive. Afterwards I gave forth a lit|tle paper concerning True Religion, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>TRUE Religion is the true rule and right way of &s;erv|ing God. And religion is a pure &s;tream of righteou&s;|ne&s;s flowing from the image of God, and is the life and power of God planted in the heart and mind by the law of life, which bringeth the &s;oul, mind, &s;pirit, and body to be conformable to God, the Father of Spirits, and to Chri&s;t; &s;o that they come to have fellow&s;hip with the Fa|ther and the Son, and with all his holy angels and &s;aints. This religion is pure from above, undefiled before God, leads to vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s, widows, and &s;trangers, and keeps from the &s;pots of the world. This religion is above all the defiled, &s;potted religions in the world, that keep not from defilements and &s;pots, but leave their profe&s;&s;ors impure, below, and &s;potted; who&s;e fatherle&s;s, widows, and &s;trangers, beg up and down the &s;treets.</P>

<P>It was long before the &s;heriff would yield to remove me to London, unle&s;s I would &s;eal a bond to him, and bear their charges; which I &s;till refu&s;ed to do. Then they con|&s;ulted how to convey me up, and fir&s;t concluded to &s;end up a party of hor&s;e with me. I told them, <Q>If I were &s;uch a man as they had repre&s;ented me to be, they had need &s;end a troop or two of hor&s;e to guard me.</Q> When they con&s;idered what a charge it would be to them to &s;end up a party of hor&s;e with me, they altered their purpo&s;e, and con|cluded to &s;end me up guarded only by the gaoler and &s;ome bailiffs. But upon farther con&s;ideration they found that would be a great charge to them al&s;o, and therefore &s;ent for me to the gaoler's hou&s;e, and told me, if I would put in bail that I would be in London &s;uch a day of the term, I &s;hould have leave to go up with &s;ome of my own friends. I told them I would neither put in bail, nor give one piece of &s;il|ver to the gaoler; for I was an innocent man, they had im|pri&s;oned me wrongfully, and laid a fal&s;e charge upon me. Neverthele&s;s I &s;aid, If they would let me go up with one or two of my friends to bear me company, I might go up and be in London &s;uch a day, if the Lord &s;hould permit; and, if they de&s;ired it, I or any of my friends that went with me would carry up their charge again&s;t my&s;elf. When they &s;aw they could do no otherwi&s;e with me, the &s;heriff con|&s;ented that <Q>I &s;hould come up with &s;ome of my friends, without any other engagement than my word, to appear before the judges at London &s;uch a day of the term, if the Lord &s;hould permit.</Q> Whereupon I was let out of pri&s;on, and went to Swarthmore, where I &s;taid two or three

That day the Lord's everla&s;ting &s;eed was &s;et over all, and friends were turned to it, who is the heir of the promi&s;e. Thence I came into Stafford&s;hire and Warwick&s;hire, to An|thony Bickliff's, and at Non-caton, at a prie&s;t's widow's hou&s;e, we had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting, wherein the everla&s;ting word of life was powerfully declared, and many &s;ettled in it. Then travelling on, vi&s;iting friends meetings, in about three weeks time from my coming out of pri&s;on, I reached London, Richard Hubberthorn and Robert Withers being with me.</P>
<P>When we came to Charing-cro&s;s, multitude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of people were gathered together to &s;ee the burning of the bowels of &s;ome of the old king's judges, who had been hanged, drawn and quartered.</P>
<P>We went next morning to judge Mallet's chamber, who was putting on his gown to &s;it upon more of the king's judges. He was then very peevi&s;h and froward, and &s;aid, I might come another time. We went another time to his chamber, when judge Fo&s;ter was with him, who was called Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of England. With me was one called E&s;quire Mar&s;h, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the bed-chamber to the king. When we had delivered to the judges the charge again&s;t me, and they had read to tho&s;e words, <Q>That I and my friends were embroiling the nation in blood,</Q> &amp;c. they &s;truck their hands on the table. Whereupon I told them, <Q>I was the man whom that charge was again&s;t, but I was as innocent of any &s;uch thing as a new-born child, and had brought it up my&s;elf; and &s;ome of my friends came up with me, without any guard.</Q> As yet they had not minded my hat; but now, &s;eeing my hat on, they &s;aid, <Q>What, did I &s;tand with my hat on!</Q> I told them I did not &s;tand &s;o in any contempt of them. Then they commanded one to take it off; and when they had called for the mai&s;hal of the king's bench, they &s;aid to him, You mu&s;t take this man and &s;ecure him, but you mu&s;t let him have a chamber, and not put him among&s;t the pri&s;oners. My Lord, &s;aid the mar&s;hal, I have no chamber to put him into; my hou&s;e is &s;o full that I cannot tell where to provide for him but among&s;t the pri&s;oners. Nay, &s;aid the judges, you mu&s;t not put him among&s;t the pri&s;oners. But whet he &s;till an&s;wered, he had

The next day I ap|peared at the king's bench bar at the hour appointed, Robert Withers, Richard Hubberthorn, and E&s;quire Mar&s;h going with me. I was brought into the middle of the court, and as &s;oon as I came in I was moved to look about, and turn|ing to the people, &s;aid, 'Peace be among you;' and the power of the Lord &s;prang over the court. The charge again&s;t me was read openly. The people were moderate, and the judges cool and loving; and the Lord's mercy was to them. But when they came to that part of it which &s;aid, <Q>That I and my friends were embroiling the nation in blood and rai&s;ing a new war, and that I was an enemy to the king,</Q> &amp;c. they lifted up their hands. Then, &s;tretch|ing out my arms, I &s;aid, <Q>I am the man whom that charge is again&s;t, but I am as innocent as a child concerning the charge, and have never learned any war po&s;tures. And, &s;aid I, do ye think, that if I and my friends were &s;uch men as the charge declares, that I &s;hould have brought it up my&s;elf again&s;t my&s;elf? Or that I &s;hould be &s;uffered to come up with one or two of my friends with me? Had I been &s;uch a man as this charge &s;ets forth, I had need to have been guarded up with a troop or two of hor&s;e. But the &s;heriff and magi&s;trates of Lanca&s;hire thought fit to let me and my friends come up with it our&s;elves, almo&s;t two hundred mile, without any guard at all; which, you may 'be &s;ure they would not have done if they had looked upon me to be &s;uch a man.</Q> The judge a&s;ked me, Whether it &s;hould be filed? or what I would do with it? I an&s;wered, Ye are judges, and able, I hope, to judge in this matter; therefore do with it what ye will; for I am the man the&s;e charges are again&s;t, and here ye &s;ee I have brought them up my&s;elf. Do ye what ye will with them, I leave it to you. Then judge Twi&s;den beginning to &s;peak &s;ome angry words, I appealed to judge Fo&s;ter and judge Mallet, who had heard me over night.

<P>Thus, after I had been a pri&s;oner &s;omewhat more than twenty weeks, I was freely &s;et at liberty by the king's com|mand, the Lord's power having wonderfully wrought for the clearing of my innocency, and Porter, who committed me, not daring to appear to make good the charge he had fal&s;ely &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t me. But after it was known I was di&s;charged, a company of envious, wicked &s;pirits were trou|bled, and terror took hold of ju&s;tice Porter; for he was afraid I would take the advantage of the law again&s;t him for my wrong impri&s;onment, and thereby undo him, his wife, and children. And indeed I was pre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome in authority to have made him and the re&s;t examples; but I &s;aid, I &s;hould leave them to the Lord; if the Lord forgave them I &s;hould not trouble my&s;elf with them.</P>
<P>Now did I &s;ee the end of the travail which I had in my &s;ore exerci&s;e at Reading; for the everla&s;ting power of the Lord was over all, and his ble&s;&s;ed truth, life, and light &s;hined over the nation, and great and glorious meetings we had, and very quiet; and many flocked unto the truth. Richard Hubberthorn had been with the king, who &s;aid, 'None &s;hould mole&s;t us &s;o long as we lived peaceably,' and promi&s;ed this upon the word of a king; telling him, we might make u&s;e of his promi&s;e. Some friends were al&s;o ad|mitted in the hou&s;e of Lords, to declare their rea&s;ons, why
<PB N="418" REF="037441_0495_100D913552A70640">they could not pay tithes, &s;wear, nor go to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e-wor&s;hip or join with others in wor&s;hip; and they heard them moderately. There being about &s;even hundred friends in pri&s;on, who had been committed under Oliver's and Richard's government, upon contempts (&s;o called) when the king came in he &s;et them all at liberty. There &s;eemed at that time an inclination and intention in the government to have granted friends liberty, becau&s;e they were &s;en&s;ible we had &s;uffered as well as they under the former powers. But when any thing was going forward in order thereunto, &s;ome dirty &s;pirits or other, that would &s;eem to be for us, threw &s;omething in the way to &s;top it. It was &s;aid there was an in&s;trument drawn up for confirming our liberty, which only wanted &s;igning; when on a &s;udden that wicked attempt of the Fifth-monarchy-people broke out, and put the city and nation in an uproar. This was on a fir&s;t-day night, and very glorious meetings we had that day, wherein the Lord's truth &s;hined over all, and his power was exalted above all; but about midnight the drums beat, and the cry was, 'Arm, Arm.' I got out of bed, and in the morning took boat, and landing at Whitehall-&s;tairs, walked through Whitehall. They looked &s;trangely at me there; but I pa&s;|&s;ed through, and went to Pall-mall, whither divers friends came to me, though it was now grown dangerous pa&s;&s;ing the &s;treets; for by this time the city and &s;uburbs were up in arms, and exceeding rude the people and &s;oldiers were; in|fomuch that Henry Fell, going to a friend's hou&s;e, the &s;ol|diers knocked him down, and he had been killed if the duke of York had not come by. Great mi&s;chief was done in the city this week; and when fir&s;t-day came, that friends went to their meetings, many were taken pri&s;oners. I &s;taid at Pall-mall, intending to be at the meeting there; but on the &s;eventh-day night a company of troopers came and knocked at the door. The maid letting them in, they &s;trait laid hold of me; and there being among&s;t them one, that had &s;erved under the parliament, he clapped his hand to my pocket, and a&s;ked, 'Whether I had any pi&s;tols?' I told him, He knew I did not u&s;e to carry pi&s;tols; why did he a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;tion of me, who he knew to be a peaceable man? O|thers of the &s;oldiers ran up into the chambers, and there found in bed '&s;quire Mar&s;h, who, though he was one of the king's bed-chamber, out of his love to me had come and lodged where I did. When they came down again, they &s;aid, 'Why &s;hould we take this man away with us? We
<PB N="419" REF="037441_0496_100D9137C6F4A7A8">will let him alone, Oh! &s;aid the parliament-&s;oldier, he is one of the heads and a chief ringleader. Upon this the &s;oldiers were taking me away; but '&s;quire Mar&s;h hearing of it, &s;ent for the commander of the party, and de&s;ired him to let me alone, for he would &s;ee me forth-coming in the morning. In the morning, before they could fetch me, and before the meeting was gathered, there came a company of foot to the hou&s;e, and one of them, drawing his &s;word, held it over my head. I a&s;ked him, <Q>Why he drew his &s;word at a naked man?</Q> At which his fellows being a&s;hamed bid him put up his &s;word. The&s;e &s;oldiers took me away to Whitehall before the troopers came for me. As I was going out &s;everal friends were coming in to the meeting, who&s;e boldne&s;s and cheerfulne&s;s I commended, and encouraged them to per&s;evere therein. When I was brought to Whitehall, the &s;oldiers and people were exceed|ing rude, yet I declared truth to them; but &s;ome great per&s;ons coming by, who were very full of envy, 'What,' &s;aid they, <Q>do ye let him preach? Put him into &s;uch a place where he may not &s;tir.</Q> So into that place they put me, and the &s;oldiers watched over me. I told them, Tho' they could confine my body and &s;hut that up, they could not &s;top up the word of life. Some thereupon came, and a&s;ked me, 'What I was?' I told them, I was a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s. After I had been kept there two or three hours, '&s;quire Mar&s;h &s;poke to lord Gerrard, who came and bid them &s;et me at liberty. The mar&s;hal, when I was di&s;|charged, demanded fees. I told him, I could not give him any, neither was it our practice. I a&s;ked him, How he could demand fees of me who was innocent? Then I went through the guards, the Lord's power being over them; and after I had declared truth to the &s;oldiers, I went up the &s;treets with two Iri&s;h colonels that came from White|hall to an inn, where many friends were pri&s;oners under a guard. I de&s;ired tho&s;e colonels to &s;peak to the guard to let me go in to vi&s;it my friends that were pri&s;oners there; but they would not. Then I &s;tept to the centry, and de|&s;ired him to let me go up; which he did. While I was there the &s;oldiers went to Pall-mall again to &s;earch for me; but not finding me they turned towards the inn, and bid all come out that were not pri&s;oners; &s;o they went out. But I a&s;ked the &s;oldiers within, Whether I might not &s;tay awhile with my friends? They &s;aid, Yes. I &s;taid, and e&s;caped their hands again. Towards night I went to Pall-mall, to
<PB N="420" REF="037441_0497_100D9139AF29FD68">&s;ee how it was with friends there, and after went into the city. Great rifling of hou&s;es there was at that time to &s;earch for people. I went to a private friend's hou&s;e and Richard Hubberthorn with me. There we drew up a declaration again&s;t plots and fightings, to be pre&s;ented to the king and council; but when we had fini&s;hed it, and &s;ent it to the pre&s;s, it was taken in the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon this in&s;urrection of the Fifth-monarchy-men great havock was made both in city and country, &s;o that it was dangerous for &s;ober people to &s;tir abroad &s;everal weeks after; and hardly could either men or women go up and down the &s;treets to buy provi&s;ions for their families without being abu&s;ed. In the country they dragged men and women out of their hou&s;es, and &s;ome &s;ick men out of their beds by the legs. Nay, one that was in a fever the &s;oldiers dragged out of his bed to pri&s;on; and when he was brought thither he died. His name was Thomas Patching.</P>
<P>Margaret Fell went to the king, and told him what &s;ad work there was in the city and nation, and &s;hewed him we were an innocent peaceable people, and that we mu&s;t keep our meetings as we u&s;ed to do whatever we &s;uffered; but it concerned him to &s;ee that peace was kept, that no inno|cent blood might be &s;hed.</P>
<P>Now were the pri&s;ons every where filled with friends and others in the city and country, and the po&s;ts were &s;o laid for the &s;earching of letters, that none could pa&s;s un&s;earched. We heard of &s;everal thou&s;ands of our friends that were ca&s;t into pri&s;on in &s;everal parts of the nation, and Margaret Fell carried an account of them to the king and council. The next week we had an account of &s;everal thou&s;ands more that were ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and &s;he went and laid them al&s;o before the king and council. They wondered how we could have &s;uch intelligence, &s;eeing they had given &s;uch &s;trict charge for the intercepting of all letters; but the Lord did &s;o order it that we had an account notwith&s;tanding all their &s;toppings. In the deep &s;en&s;e I had of the grievous &s;ufferings friends underwent, and of their innocency to|wards God and man, I was moved to &s;end the following epi&s;tle to them, as a word of con&s;olation, and to put them upon &s;ending up their &s;ufferings.</P>

<P>OUR principle is, and our practices have always been to &s;eek peace and en&s;ue it; to follow after righteou&s;|ne&s;s and the knowledge of God; &s;eeking the good and welfare, and doing that which tends to the peace of all. We know that wars and fightings proceed from the lu&s;ts of men, as Jam. iv. 1, 2, 3, out of which lu&s;ts the Lord
<PB N="422" REF="037441_0499_100D913DD32D64B0">hath redeemed us, and &s;o out of the occa&s;ion of war. The occa&s;ion of war and the war it&s;elf (wherein envious men, who are lovers of them&s;elves more than lovers of God, lu&s;t, kill, and de&s;ire to have men's lives or e&s;tates) ari&s;eth from the lu&s;t. All bloody principles and practices we, as to our own particulars, do utterly deny, with all outward wars, &s;trife, and fighting with outward weapons for any end, or under any pretence what&s;oever: this is our te&s;timony to the whole world.</P>
<P>And whereas it is objected: But although you now &s;ay, <Q>That you cannot fight nor take up arms at all; yet if the Spirit move you, then you will change your principle, you will &s;ell your coat and buy a &s;word, and fight for the kingdom of Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>To this we an&s;wer, Chri&s;t &s;aid to Peter, <Q>Put up thy &s;word in his place;</Q> though he had &s;aid before, he that had no &s;word might &s;ell his coat and buy one (to the ful|filling of the law and the &s;cripture) yet after, when he had bid him put it up, he &s;aid, <Q>He that taketh the &s;word &s;hall peri&s;h with the &s;word.</Q> And Chri&s;t &s;aid to Pilate, <Q>Thinke&s;t thou, that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he &s;hall pre&s;ently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</Q> And this might &s;atisfy Peter, Luke xxii. 36. after he had put up his &s;word, when he &s;aid to him, <Q>He that took it, &s;hould peri&s;h by it;</Q> which &s;atisfieth us, Mat. xxvi. 51, 52, 53. In the Revelations it is &s;aid, <Q>He that kills with the &s;word &s;hall peri&s;h with the &s;word; and here is the faith and the patience of the &s;aints.</Q> So Chri&s;t's kingdom is not of this world, therefore do not his &s;ervants fight, as he told Pilate, the magi&s;trate who cruci|fied him. And did they not look upon Chri&s;t as a rai&s;er of &s;edition? and did not he pray, "Forgive them?" But thus it is that we are numbered among&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, and among&s;t fighters, that the &s;criptures might be fulfilled.</P>
<P>That the Spirit of Chri&s;t, by which we are guided, is not changeable, &s;o as once to command us from a thing, as evil, and again to move unto it. We certainly know and te&s;tify to the world, That the Spirit of Chri&s;t, which leads us into all truth, will never move us to fight and war again&s;t any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Chri&s;t nor for the kingdoms of this world.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e the kingdom of Chri&s;t God will exalt, according to his promi&s;e, and cau&s;e it to grow and &s;louri&s;h in righteou&s;ne&s;s, <Q>Not by might, nor by power (of out|ward
<PB N="423" REF="037441_0500_100D91402207AB80">&s;word) but by my Spirit, &s;aith the Lord,</Q> Zech. iv. 6. So tho&s;e that u&s;e any weapon to fight for Chri&s;t, or for the e&s;tabli&s;hing of his kingdom or government, their &s;pirit, principle, and practice we deny.</P>
<P>Secondly, We earne&s;tly de&s;ire and wait, that (by the word of God's power, and its effectual operation in the hearts of men) the kingdoms of this world may become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chri&s;t; and that he may rule and reign in men by his Spirit and truth; that thereby all people, out of all different judgments and profe&s;&s;ions, may be brought into love and unity with God, and one with another; and that all may come to witne&s;s the prophet's words fulfilled, who &s;aid, <Q>Nation &s;hall not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more,</Q> I&s;a. ii. 4 Mich. iv. 3.</P>
<P>Since we, whom the Lord hath called into the obedi|ence of his truth, have denied wars and fightings, and cannot any more learn them. This is a certain te&s;timony unto all the world of the truth of our hearts in this parti|cular, that as God per&s;uadeth every man's heart to be|lieve, &s;o they may receive it. For we have not, as &s;ome others, gone about cunningly with devi&s;ed fables, nor have we ever denied in practice what we have profe&s;&s;ed in prin|ciple; but in &s;incerity and truth, and by the word of God, have we laboured to be made manife&s;t unto all men, that both we and our ways might be witne&s;&s;ed in the hearts of all. And whereas all manner of evil hath been fal&s;ely &s;poken of us, we hereby &s;peak the plain truth of our hearts, to take away the occa&s;ion of that offence, that &s;o we, being innocent, may not &s;uffer for other men's of|fences, nor be made a prey of by the wills of men for that of which we were never guilty; but in the uprightne&s;s of our hearts we may, under the power ordained of God for the puni&s;hment of evil-doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well, live a peaceable life in all godline&s;s and ho|ne&s;ty. For although we have always &s;uffered, and do now more abundantly &s;uffer, yet we know it is for right|eou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake: <Q>For our rejoicing is this, the te&s;timony of our con&s;ciences, that in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, not with fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conver&s;ation in the world,</Q> 2 Cor. i. 12, which for us is a witne&s;s for the convincing of our ene|mies. For this we can &s;ay to all the world, we have wronged no man, we have u&s;ed no force nor violence
<PB N="424" REF="037441_0501_100D9141B34A8610">again&s;t any man, we have been found in no plots, nor guilty of &s;edition. When we have been wronged we have not &s;ought to revenge our&s;elves, we have not made re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t authority; but wherein we could not obey for con|&s;cience &s;ake, we have &s;uffered the mo&s;t of any people in the nation. We have been counted as &s;heep for the &s;laughter, per&s;ecuted and de&s;pi&s;ed, beaten, &s;toned, wound|ed, &s;tocked, whipped, impri&s;oned, haled out of the &s;yna|gogues, ca&s;t into dungeons and noi&s;ome vaults, where ma|ny have died in bonds, &s;hut up from our friends, denied needful &s;u&s;tenance for many days together, with other the like cruelties. And the cau&s;e of all the&s;e our &s;ufferings is not for any evil, but for things relating to the wor&s;hip of our God, and in obedience to his requirings. <Q>For which cau&s;e we &s;hall freely give up our bodies a &s;acrifice, rather than di&s;obey the Lord;</Q> knowing, as the Lord hath kept us innocent, he will plead our cau&s;e when there is none in the earth to plead it. So we, in obedience to his truth, do not love our lives unto death, that we may do his will, and wrong no man in our generation, but &s;eck the good and peace of all men. He who hath commanded us, "That we &s;hall not &s;wear at all," Matth. v. 34, hath al&s;o commanded us, "That we &s;hall not kill," Matth. v. So that we can neither kill men, nor &s;wear for nor again&s;t them. This is both our principle and our practice, and hath been from the beginning; &s;o that if we &s;uffer, as &s;u&s;|pected to take up arms or make war again&s;t any, it is without any ground from us; for it neither is, nor ever was in our hearts, &s;ince we owned the truth of God; nei|ther &s;hall we ever do it, becau&s;e it is contrary to the Spirit of Chri&s;t, his doctrine, and the practices of his apo&s;tles; even contrary to him for whom we &s;uffer all things and endure all things.</P>
<P>And whereas men come again&s;t us with clubs, &s;taves, drawn &s;words, pi&s;tols cock'd, and beat, cut, and abu&s;e us; yet we never re&s;i&s;ted them, but to them our hair, backs, and cheeks have been ready. It is not an honour to manhood or nobility to run upon harmle&s;s people, who lift not an hand again&s;t them, with arms and weapons.</P>
<P>Therefore con&s;ider the&s;e things, ye men of under&s;tand|ing; for plotters, rai&s;ers of in&s;urrections, tumultuous ones, and fighters, running with &s;words, clubs, &s;taves, and pi&s;|tols, one again&s;t another; we &s;ay, the&s;e are of the world, and have their foundation from this unrighteous world,
<PB N="425" REF="037441_0502_100D914347E2B510">from the foundation of which the Lamb hath been &s;lain: which Lamb hath redeemed us from this unrighteous world; we are not of it, but are heirs of a world of which there is no end, a kingdom where no corruptible thing enters. Our weapons are &s;piritual, not carnal, yet mighty through God to the pulling down of the &s;trong holds of &s;in and Satan, who is the author of wars, fighting, murder, and plots. Our &s;words are broken into plough-&s;hares, and &s;pears into pruning-hooks, as prophe&s;ied of in Micah iv. Therefore we cannot learn war any more, neither ri&s;e up again&s;t nation or kingdom with outward weapons, though you have numbered us among&s;t the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors and plotters. The Lord knows our innocency herein, and will plead our cau&s;e with all people upon earth at the day of their judgment, when all men &s;hall have a re|ward according to their works.</P>
<P>Therefore in love we warn you for your &s;ouls good, not to wrong the innocent, nor the babes of Chri&s;t, which he hath in his hand, and tenders as the apple of his eye; neither &s;eek to de&s;troy the heritage of God, nor turn your &s;words backward upon &s;uch as the law was not made for, i. e. the righteous; but for the &s;inners and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, to keep them down. For tho&s;e are not peace-makers nor lovers of enemies, neither can they overcome evil with good, who wrong them that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ends to you and all men, and wi&s;h your good and the good of all people upon earth. If you oppre&s;s us as they did the children of I&s;rael in Egypt, if you oppre&s;s us as they did when Chri&s;t was born, and as they did the Chri&s;tians in the primitive times, we can &s;ay, "The Lord forgive you;" leave the Lord to deal with you, and not revenge our|&s;elves. If you &s;ay, as the council &s;aid to Peter and John, "You mu&s;t &s;peak no more in that name;" and if you &s;erve us as they &s;erved the three children &s;poken of in Daniel, God is the &s;ame as he ever was, that lives for ever and ever, who hath the innocent in his arms.</P>
<P>Oh! friends! offend not the Lord and his little ones, neither afflict his people; but con&s;ider and be moderate, Run not ha&s;tily into things, but mind and con&s;ider mercy, ju&s;tice, and judgment; that is the way for you to pro&s;per and get the favour of the Lord. Our meetings were &s;top|ped and broken up in the days of Oliver, under pretence of plotting again&s;t him; in the days of the Committee of Safety we were looked upon as plotters to bring in king
<PB N="426" REF="037441_0503_100D91460AB23090">Charles; and now our peaceable meetings are termed &s;e|ditious. Oh! that men &s;hould lo&s;e their rea&s;on, and go contrary to their own con&s;ciences; knowing that we have &s;uffered all things, and have been accounted plotters all along, though we have always declared again&s;t them both by word of mouth and printing, and are clear from any &s;uch thing! Though we have &s;uffered all along, becau&s;e we would not take up carnal weapons to fight again&s;t any, and are thus made a prey upon becau&s;e we are the inno|cent lambs of Chri&s;t, and cannot avenge our&s;elves! The&s;e things are left upon your hearts to con&s;ider; for we are out of all tho&s;e things in the patience of the &s;aints, and we know as Chri&s;t &s;aid, <Q>He that takes the &s;word &s;hall peri&s;h with the &s;word,</Q> Matth. xxvi. 52.

<P><Q>This is given forth from the people called Quakers, to &s;atisfy the king and his council, and all that have any jealou&s;y concerning us, that all occa&s;ion of &s;u&s;picion may be taken away, and our innocency cleared.</Q></P>

<P>THIS was our te&s;timony above twenty years ago, and &s;ince then we have not been found acting contrary to it, nor ever &s;hall; for the truth that is our guide is un|changeable.

<P>This Declaration did &s;omewhat clear the dark air that was over the city and country; and &s;oon after the king gave forth a proclamation, <Q>That no &s;oldiers &s;hould &s;earch any hou&s;e without a con&s;table.</Q>But the gaols were &s;till full, many thou&s;ands of friends being in pri&s;on; which mi&s;chief was occa&s;ioned by the wicked ri&s;ing of tho&s;e Fifth-monarchy-men. But when tho&s;e of them that were taken came to be executed, they did us the ju&s;tice to clear us openly from having any hand in or knowledge of their plot. After that the king, being continually importuned thereun|to, i&s;&s;ued forth a Declaration, <Q>That friends &s;hould be &s;et at liberty without paying fees.</Q> But great labour, tra|vail, 'and pains were taken before this was obtained; for Thomas Moor and Margaret Fell went often to the king about it.</P>

Much blood was &s;hed this year, many of the old king's judges being hanged, drawn, and quartered. Among&s;t tho&s;e that &s;uffered colonel Hacker was one, who &s;ent me pri&s;oner from Leice&s;ter to London in Oliver's time. A &s;ad day it was, and a repaying of blood with blood. For in the time of O. Cromwel, when &s;everal were hanged, drawn, and quartered for pretended trea&s;ons, I felt from the Lord God that their blood would not be put up, but would be required, and I &s;aid as much then to &s;everal, and now al&s;o upon the king's return, when &s;everal that had been again&s;t the king were put to death, as the others that were for the king had been before by Oliver. This was &s;ad work, de|&s;troying people contrary to the nature of Chri&s;tians, who have the nature of lambs and &s;heep. But there was a &s;ecret hand in bringing this day upon that hypocritical generation of profe&s;&s;ors, who being got into power grew proud, haughty, and cruel beyond others, and per&s;ecuted the people of God without pity. Therefore when friends were under cruel per&s;ecutions and &s;ufferings in the commonwealth's time, I was moved of the Lord to write unto them, to draw up their &s;ufferings, and lay them before the ju&s;tices at their &s;e&s;&s;ions; and if they would not do them ju&s;tice, then to lay them before the judges at the a&s;&s;ize; and if they refu&s;ed them ju&s;tice, to lay it before the parliament, and before the protec|tor and his council, that they might all &s;ee what was done under their government; and if they would not do ju&s;tice, then to lay it before the Lord, who would hear the cries of the oppre&s;&s;ed, the widows, and fatherle&s;s, whom they had made &s;o. For that which we &s;uffered for, and which our goods were &s;poiled for, was our obedience to the Lord in his Power and in his Spirit, who is able to help and &s;uc|cour, and we had no helper in the earth but him. And he heard the cries of his people, and brought an overflowing &s;courge over the heads of all our per&s;ecutors, which brought a quaking, a dread, and a fear among&s;t and on them all; &s;o that tho&s;e who had nick-named us (who are the children of light) and in &s;corn called us Quakers, the Lord made to quake, and many of them would have been glad to have hid them&s;elves among&s;t us; and &s;ome of them, through the di&s;tre&s;s that came upon them, did at length con&s;e&s;s to the truth. Oh! the daily reproaches, revilings, and beatings we underwent among&s;t them, even in the highways, becau&s;e we could not put off our hats to them, and for &s;aying Thou and Thee to them! Oh! the havock and &s;poil the prie&s;ts
<PB N="429" REF="037441_0506_100D914B27200978">made of our goods, becau&s;e we could not put into their mouths and give them tithes! Be&s;ides ca&s;ting into pri&s;ons, and be&s;ides the great fines laid upon us becau&s;e we could not &s;wear! But for all the&s;e things did the Lord God plead with them. Yet &s;ome of them were &s;o hardened in their wickedne&s;s, that when they were turned out of their places and offices, they &s;aid, <Q>If they had power they would do the &s;ame again.</Q> And when this day of over|turning was come upon them, they &s;aid, <Q>It was all along of us.</Q>Wherefore I was moved to write to them, and to a&s;k, <Q>Did we ever re&s;i&s;t them when they took away our ploughs and plough-gears, our carts and hor&s;es, our corn and cattle, our kettles and platters from us, and whipped us, and &s;et us in the &s;tocks, and ca&s;t us into pri&s;on, and all this only for &s;erving and wor&s;hipping God in &s;pirit and truth, and becau&s;e we could not conform to their re|ligions, manners, cu&s;toms, and fa&s;hions? Did we ever re&s;i&s;t them? Did we not give them our backs to beat, our cheeks to pull off the hair, and our faces to &s;pit on? Had not their prie&s;ts, that prompted them on to &s;uch work, plucked them with them&s;elves into the ditch? Why then would they &s;ay, "It was all along of us?" when it was owing to them&s;elves and their prie&s;ts, their blind pro|phets, that followed their own &s;pirits, and could fore&s;ee nothing of the&s;e times and things that are come upon them, which we had long forewarned them of; as Jeremi|ah and Chri&s;t had forewarned Jeru&s;alem. They thought to have wearied us out and undone us; but they undid them&s;elves. Whereas we could prai&s;e God, notwith&s;tand|ing all their plundering of us, that we had a kettle, a platter, an hor&s;e, and plough &s;till.</Q></P>
<P>Many ways were the&s;e profe&s;&s;ors warned, by word, by writing, and by &s;igns; but they would believe none till it was too late. William Symp&s;on was moved of the Lord to go at &s;everal times for three years naked and bare-footed before them, as a &s;ign to them, in markets, courts, towns, cities, to prie&s;ts hou&s;es, and to great men's hou&s;es; telling them, <Q>So &s;hould they be &s;tripped naked as he was &s;tripped naked!</Q> And &s;ometimes he was moved to put on hair|&s;ackcloth, and to be&s;mear his face, and to tell them, <Q>So would the Lord God be&s;mear all their religion as he was be&s;meared.</Q> Great &s;ufferings did that poor man under|go, &s;ore whippings with hor&s;e-whips and coach-whips on his bare body, grievous &s;toning and impri&s;onments in three
<PB N="430" REF="037441_0507_100D914DF283A018">years time, before the king came in, that they might have taken warning; but they would not, and rewarded his love with cruel u&s;age. Only the mayor of Cambridge did nobly to him, for he put his gown about him, and took him into his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Another friend, Robert Huntingdon, was moved of the Lord to go into Carli&s;le &s;teeple-hou&s;e with a white &s;heet about him, among&s;t the great Pre&s;byterians and Indepen|dents there, to &s;hew them that the &s;urplice was coming up again; and he put an halter about his neck to &s;hew them that an halter was coming upon them; which was fulfilled upon &s;ome of our per&s;ecutors not long after.</P>
<P>Another, Richard Sale, living near We&s;tche&s;ter, being con&s;table of the place where he lived, had a friend &s;ent to him with a pa&s;s (whom tho&s;e wicked profe&s;&s;ors had taken up for a vagabond, becau&s;e he travelled up and down in the work of the mini&s;try) and this con&s;table, being convinced by the friend thus brought to him, gave him his pa&s;s and li|berty, and was afterwards him&s;elf ca&s;t into pri&s;on. After this, on a lecture-day, Richard Sale was moved to go to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e in the time of their wor&s;hip, and to carry tho&s;e per&s;ecuting prie&s;ts and people a lanthorn and candle, as a figure of their darkne&s;s; but they cruelly abu&s;ed him, and like dark profe&s;&s;ors as they were put him into their pri&s;on cal|led Little Ea&s;e, and &s;o &s;queezed his body therein that not long after he died. Many warnings of divers &s;orts were friends moved in the power of the Lord to give unto that generation; which they not only rejected, but abu&s;ed friends, calling us giddy-headed Quakers, but God brought his judgments upon tho&s;e per&s;ecuting prie&s;ts and magi&s;trates. For when the king came in, mo&s;t of them were turned out of their places and benefices, the &s;poilers were &s;poiled; and then we could a&s;k them, Who were the giddy-heads now? Then many confe&s;&s;ed we had been true prophets to the na|tion, and &s;aid, Had we cried again&s;t &s;ome prie&s;ts only they &s;hould have liked us then; but we crying again&s;t all, that made them di&s;like us. But now they &s;aw that tho&s;e prie&s;ts, then looked upon to be the be&s;t, were as bad as the re&s;t. For indeed &s;ome of tho&s;e that were counted the mo&s;t eminent prie&s;ts were the bittere&s;t and greate&s;t &s;tirrers up of the ma|gi&s;trates to per&s;ecution, and it was a judgment upon them to be denied the free liberty of their con&s;ciences when the king came in, becau&s;e when they were uppermo&s;t they would not have liberty of con&s;cience granted to others. One
<PB N="431" REF="037441_0508_100D914FDD63E530">Hewes, of Plymouth, a prie&s;t of great note in Oliver's days, when &s;ome liberty was granted, prayed, <Q>That God would put it into the hearts of the chief magi&s;trates of the nation to remove this cur&s;ed Toleration.</Q> Others of them pray|ed again&s;t it by the name of Intolerable Toleration. But a|while after, when the king was come in, and prie&s;t Hewes turned out of his great benefice for not conforming to the Common Prayer, a friend from Plymouth meeting with him, a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether he would account Toleration accur&s;ed now? And whether he would not now be glad of a Toleration?</Q> To which the prie&s;t returned no an&s;wer, &s;ave by the &s;haking of his head. But as &s;tiff as this &s;ort of men were then again&s;t Toleration, it is well known many of them petit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oned the king for Toleration and for meeting-places, and paid for licences too. But to return to the pre|&s;ent time, the latter end of the year 1660 and the beginning of 1661.</P>
<P>Although tho&s;e friends, who had been impri&s;oned upon the ri&s;ing of tho&s;e Monarchy-men, were &s;et at liberty, yet meetings were much di&s;turbed, and great &s;ufferings friends underwent; for be&s;ides what was done by officers and &s;oldi|ers, many wild fellows and rude people often came in. There came one time, when I was at Pall-mall, an amba&s;&s;a|dor with a company of Iri&s;hmen with rude fellows: the meeting was over before they came, and I was gone up in|to a chamber, where I heard one of them &s;ay, he would 'kill all the Quakers.' I went down to him, and was mov|ed in the power of the Lord to &s;peak to him. I told him, the law &s;aid, 'An eye for an e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and a tooth for a tooth;' but thou threatene&s;t to <Q>kill all the Quakers, though they have done thee no hurt.</Q> But, &s;aid I, here is go&s;pel for thee: <Q>Here's my hair, here's my cheek, here's my &s;houl|der,</Q> turning it to him. This came &s;o over him, that he and his companions &s;tood as men amazed, and &s;aid, If that was our principle, and if we were as we &s;aid, they never &s;aw the like in their lives. I told them, What I was in words, I was the &s;ame in life. Then the amba&s;&s;ador who had &s;tood without, came in; for he &s;aid, that Iri&s;h colonel was &s;uch a de&s;perate man, he dur&s;t not come in with him for fear he &s;hould have done us &s;ome mi&s;chief; but truth came over him, and he carried him&s;elf lovingly towards us, as al&s;o did the amba&s;&s;ador; for the Lord's power was over them all.</P>
<P>At Mile-end friends were kept out of their meeting-place
<PB N="432" REF="037441_0509_100D91516C305120">by &s;oldiers; but friends &s;tood nobly in the truth, valiant for the Lord's name, and at la&s;t the truth gave them dominion.</P>
<P>About this time we had an account that John Love, a friend that was moved to go and bear te&s;timony again&s;t the idolatry of the Papi&s;ts, was dead in pri&s;on at Rome: it was &s;u&s;pected he was privately put to death. John Perrot was al&s;o pri&s;oner there, and being relea&s;ed came over again; but after his arrival here, he, with Charles Baily and &s;ome others, turned a&s;ide from the unity of friends and truth. Whereupon I was moved to give forth a paper, declaring how the Lord would bla&s;t him and his followers, if they did not repent and return, and that they &s;hould wither like the gra&s;s on the hou&s;e-top; which many of them did: but others repented and returned.</P>
<P>Al&s;o before this time we received account from New-England, <Q>That the government there had made a law to bani&s;h the Quakers out of their colonies, upon pain of death in ca&s;e they returned; that &s;everal of our friends, having been &s;o bani&s;hed and returning, were thereupon taken and actually hanged, and that divers more were in pri&s;on, in danger of the like &s;entence to be executed upon them.</Q> When tho&s;e were put to death, I was in pri&s;on at Lanca&s;ter, and had a perfect &s;en&s;e of their &s;ufferings as though it had been my&s;elf, and as though the halter had been put about my own neck, though we had not at that time heard of it. But as &s;oon as we heard of it, Edward Burrough went to the king, and told him, <Q>There was a vein of innocent blood opened in his dominions, which if it were not &s;topped would over-run all.</Q> To which the king replied, 'But I will &s;top that vein.' Edward Bur|rough &s;aid, <Q>Then do it &s;peedily, for we know not how many may &s;oon be put to death.</Q> The king an&s;wered, <Q>As &s;peedily as ye will. Call (&s;aid he to &s;ome pre&s;ent) the &s;ecretary, and I will do it pre&s;ently.</Q> The &s;ecretary being called, a mandamus was forthwith granted. A day or two after, Edward Burrough going again to the king to de&s;ire the matter might be expedited, the king &s;aid, He had no occa&s;ion at pre&s;ent to &s;end a &s;hip thither, but if we would &s;end one we might do it as &s;oon as we would. Ed|ward then a&s;ked the king, If it would plea&s;e him to grant his deputation to one called a Quaker to carry the manda|mus to New-England? He &s;aid, 'Yes, to whom ye will.' Whereupon E. B. named Samuel Shattock, who being an inhabitant of New-England was bani&s;hed by their law, to
<PB N="433" REF="037441_0510_100D915306B7F0B0">be hanged if he came again, and to him the deputation was granted. Then he &s;ent for Ralph Gold&s;mith, an hone&s;t friend, who was ma&s;ter of a good &s;hip, and ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed with him for three hundred pounds (goods or no goods) to &s;ail in ten days. He forthwith prepared to &s;et &s;ail, and with a pro&s;|perous gale, in about &s;ix weeks time, arrived before the town of Bo&s;ton in New-England, upon a fir&s;t-day morning. With him went many pa&s;&s;engers, both of New and Old England, friends, whom the Lord moved to go to bear their te&s;timony again&s;t tho&s;e bloody per&s;ecutors, who had exceeded all the world in that age in their bloody per&s;ecutions. The town&s;men at Bo&s;ton, &s;eeing a &s;hip come into the bay with Engli&s;h colours, &s;oon came on board and a&s;ked for the cap|tain. Ralph Gold&s;mith told him. He was the command|er. They a&s;ked him, If he had any letters? He &s;aid, Yes. They a&s;ked, If he would deliver them? He &s;aid, 'No, not to-day.' So they went a&s;hore, and reported, There was a &s;hip full of Quakers, and that Samuel Shat|tock was among them, who they knew was by their law to be put to death for coming again after bani&s;hment; but they knew not his errand nor his authority. So all being kept clo&s;e that day, and none of the &s;hip's company &s;uf|fered to go on &s;hore; next morning Samuel Shattock, the king's deputy, and Ralph Gold&s;mith, went on &s;hore, and &s;ending back to the &s;hip the men that landed them, they two went through the town to the governor's, John Endi|cott's door, and knocked. He &s;ent out a man to know their bu&s;ine&s;s. They &s;ent him word their bu&s;ine&s;s was from the king of England, and they would deliver their me&s;&s;age to none but the governor him&s;elf. Thereupon they were ad|mitted in, and the governor came to them; and having re|ceived the deputation and the mandamus, he put off his hat and looked upon them. Then going out, he bid the friends follow him. He went to the deputy-governor, and after a &s;hort con&s;ultation came out to the friends, and &s;aid, 'We &s;hall obey his maje&s;ty's commands.' After this the ma&s;ter gave liberty to the pa&s;&s;engers to come on &s;hore, and pre&s;ently the noi&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s flew about the town; and the friends of the town and the pa&s;&s;engers of the &s;hip me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> together to offer up their prai&s;es and thank&s;givings to God, who had &s;o wonderfully delivered them from the teeth of the devourer.

<P>Some time after this &s;everal New-England magi&s;trates came over, with one of their prie&s;ts. We had &s;everal di&s;|cour&s;es with them concerning their murdering our friends,
<PB N="435" REF="037441_0512_100D7F8567D89B78">the &s;ervants of the Lord; but they were a&s;hamed to &s;tand to their bloody actions. At one of tho&s;e meetings I a&s;ked Simon Broad&s;treet, one of the New-England magi&s;trates, Whether he had not an hand in putting to death tho&s;e four &s;ervants of God, whom they hanged for being Quakers only, as they had nicknamed them? He confe&s;&s;ed, He had. I then a&s;ked him, and the re&s;t of his a&s;&s;ociates then pre&s;ent, Whether they would acknowledge them&s;elves to be &s;ubjects to the laws of England? And if they did, by what law they had put our friends to death? They &s;aid, They were &s;ubjects to the laws of England, and they had put our friends to death by the &s;ame law as the Je&s;uits were put to death here in England. I a&s;ked them then, Whether they did believe tho&s;e friends of ours, whom they had put to death, were Je&s;uits or je&s;uitically affected? They &s;aid, Nay. Then, &s;aid I, ye have murdered them, if ye have put them to death by the law that Je&s;uits are put to death here in England, and yet confe&s;s they were no Je&s;uits.' By this it plainly appears ye have put them to death in your own wills, without any law. Then Simon Broad&s;treet, finding him&s;elf and his company en&s;nared by their own words, &s;aid, Did we come to catch them? I told them, they had catched them&s;elves, and they might ju&s;tly be que&s;tioned for their lives; and if the father of William Ro|bin&s;on (who was one of tho&s;e that were put to death) was in town, it was probable he would que&s;tion them, and bring their lives into jeopardy. Hereupon they began to excu&s;e them&s;elves, &s;aying, <Q>There was no per&s;ecution now among&s;t them;</Q> but next morning we had letters from New-England, giving us account that our friends were per|&s;ecuted there afre&s;h. Thereupon we went to them again, and &s;hewed them our letters, which put them both to &s;ilence and to &s;hame. In great fear they &s;eemed to be, le&s;t &s;ome &s;hould call them to account and pro&s;ecute them for their lives, e&s;pecially Simon Broad&s;treet; for he had at fir&s;t be|fore &s;o many witne&s;&s;es confe&s;&s;ed, <Q>He had a hand in put|ting our friends to death,</Q> that he could not get from it; though he afterwards through fear &s;huffled, and would have un&s;aid it again. After this he and the re&s;t &s;oon left the city, and got back to New-England again. I went al&s;o to go|vernor Winthorp, and di&s;cour&s;ed with him about the&s;e matters; but he a&s;&s;ured me, <Q>He had no hand in putting our friends to death, or in any way per&s;ecuting of them, but was one of them that prote&s;ted again&s;t it.</Q> The&s;e
<PB N="436" REF="037441_0513_100D915997B050D8">&s;tingy per&s;ecutors of New-England were a people that fled out of Old England thither from the per&s;ecution of the bi&s;hops here; but when they had got power into their hands, they &s;o far exceeded the bi&s;hops in &s;everity and cru|elty, that whereas the bi&s;hops had made them pay twelve pence a Sunday (&s;o called) for not coming to their wor&s;hip here, they impo&s;ed a fine of five &s;hillings a day upon &s;uch as &s;hould not conform to their will-wor&s;hip there, and &s;poil|ed the goods of friends that could not pay it. Be&s;ides, many they impri&s;oned, divers they whipped, and that mo&s;t cruelly; they cut the ears off &s;ome, and &s;ome they hanged: as the books of friends &s;ufferings in New-England largely &s;hew, particularly one written by George Bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, intituled, New-England judged: (in two parts.) Some of the old Royali&s;ts were earne&s;t with friends to have pro|&s;ecuted them; but we told them, we left them to the Lord, to whom vengeance belonged, and he would repay it. And the judgments of God have &s;ince fallen heavy on them; for the Indians have been rai&s;ed up again&s;t them, and have cut off many of them.</P>
<P>About this time I lo&s;t a very good book, being taken in the printer's hands: it was a u&s;eful, teaching book, con|taining the &s;ignification and explanation of Names, Para|bles, Types, and Figures in the &s;criptures. Tho&s;e who took it were &s;o affected therewith that they were loth to de&s;troy it; but thinking to have made a great advantage of it, they would have let us had it again, if we would have given them a great &s;um of money for it; which we were not free to do.</P>
<P>Before this, while I was pri&s;oner in Lanca&s;ter ca&s;tle, the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k called the Battledore came forth, which was written to &s;hew that in all languages Thou and Thee is the proper and u&s;ual form of &s;peech to a &s;ingle per&s;on, and You to more than one. This was &s;et forth in examples or in&s;tances taken out of the &s;criptures, and out of books of in&s;truction in about thirty languages. John Stubbs and Benjamin Furly took great pains in compiling it, which I put them upon; and &s;ome things I added to it. When it was fini&s;h|ed, &s;ome of them were pre&s;ented to the king and his coun|cil, to the bi&s;hops of Canterbury and London, and to the two univer&s;ities one apiece; and many bought of them. The king &s;aid, 'It was the proper language of all nations.' The bi&s;hop of Canterbury, being a&s;ked what he thought of it, was &s;o at a &s;tand that he could not tell what to &s;ay to
<PB N="437" REF="037441_0514_100D915BA8866F78">it. For it did &s;o inform and convince people, that few afterwards were &s;o rugged towards us for &s;aying Thou and Thee to a &s;ingle per&s;on, which before they were exceeding fierce again&s;t us for. For Thou and Thee was a &s;ore cut to proud fle&s;h, and them that &s;ought &s;elf-honour; who, though they would &s;ay it to God and Chri&s;t, would not endure to have it &s;aid to them&s;elves. So that we were often beat and abu&s;ed, and &s;ometimes in danger of our lives for u&s;ing tho&s;e words to &s;ome proud men, who would &s;ay, 'What! you ill-bred clown, do you Thou me!' as though there lay chri&s;tian breeding in &s;aying You to one, which is contrary to their grammars and teaching books, by which they in&s;tructed their youth.</P>
<P>Now the bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts being bu&s;y and eager to &s;et up their form of wor&s;hip, and compel all to come to it, I was moved to give forth the following paper, to open the nature of the true wor&s;hip which Chri&s;t &s;et up, and which God accepts; thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>CHRIST's wor&s;hip is free in the Spirit to all men; and &s;uch as wor&s;hip in the Spirit and in the truth are tho&s;e that God &s;eeks to wor&s;hip him; for he is the God of truth, and is a Spirit, and the God of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h. He hath given to all nations of men and wo|men breath and life, to live, move, and have their being in him, and hath put into them an immortal &s;oul. So all nations of men and women are to be temples for him to dwell in; and they that defile his temple will he de&s;troy. Now as the outward Jews, while they had their outward temple a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Jeru&s;alem, were to go thither to wor&s;hip (which temple God hath long &s;ince thrown down, and de&s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed that Jeru&s;alem, the vi&s;ion of peace, and ca&s;t off the Jews and their wor&s;hip, and in the room thereof hath &s;et up his go&s;pel-wor&s;hip in the Spirit and in the truth) &s;o now all are to wor&s;hip in the Spirit and in the truth. This is a free wor&s;hip; for where the Spirit of the Lord is and ruleth, there is liberty; the fruits of the Spirit are &s;een, and will manife&s;t them&s;elves; and the Spirit is not to be limited, but to be lived and walked in, that the fruits of it may appear. The tares are &s;uch as hang upon the wheat, and thereby draw it down to the earth; yet the tares and the wheat mu&s;t grow together till the harve&s;t, le&s;t they that take upon them to pluck up the tares &s;hould pluck up the wheat with the tares. The tares are &s;uch as wor&s;hip
<PB N="438" REF="037441_0515_100D915E44189580">not God in the Spirit and in the truth, but grieve the Spirit, vex and quench it in them&s;elves, and walk not in the truth; yet will hang about the wheat, the true wor|&s;hippers in the Spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and in the truth. Chri&s;t's church was never e&s;tabli&s;hed by blood, nor held up by pri&s;ons; neither was the foundation of it laid by carnal armed men, nor is it pre&s;erved by &s;uch. When men went from the Spirit and truth, they took up carnal weapons to maintain their outward forms, and yet cannot pre&s;erve them with their carnal weapons; for one plucketh down another's form with his outward weapons. And this work hath been among the Chri&s;tians in name &s;ince they lo&s;t the Spirit, and &s;piritual weapons, and the true wor&s;hip which Chri&s;t &s;et up, that is in the Spirit and in the truth; which Spirit and truth they that wor&s;hip in are over all the tares. All that would be plucking up the tares are forbidden by Chri&s;t, who hath all power in heaven and earth given to him; for the tares and the wheat mu&s;t grow together till the harve&s;t, as Chri&s;t hath commanded. The &s;tone that &s;mote the image became a great mountain, and &s;illed the whole earth: now if the &s;tone do fill the whole earth, all nations mu&s;t be temples for the &s;tone. All that &s;ay they travail for the &s;eed, and yet bring forth nothing but a birth of &s;trife, contention, and confu&s;ion, their fruit &s;hews their travail to be wrong; for by the fruit the end of every one's work is &s;een of what &s;ort it is.</P>

<P>About this time many Papi&s;ts and Je&s;uits be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n to fawn upon friends, and talked up and down where they came, that of all the &s;ects the Quakers were the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;elf|denying people; and &s;aid, <Q>It was great pity that they did not return to the holy mother church.</Q> Thus they made a buzz among the people, and &s;aid, <Q>They would willingly di&s;cour&s;e with friends.</Q> But friends were loth to meddle with them, becau&s;e they were Je&s;uits, looking upon it to be both dangerous and &s;candalous. But when I under|&s;tood it, I &s;aid to friends, <Q>Let us di&s;cour&s;e with them, be they what they will.</Q> So a time being appointed at Ger|rard Roberts's, there came two of them like courtiers. They a&s;ked our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ames, which we told them; but we did not a&s;k their nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, for we under&s;tood they were called Papi&s;ts, and they knew we were called Quakers. I a&s;ked them the &s;ame que&s;tion that I had formerly a&s;ked a Je&s;uit, namely,
<PB N="439" REF="037441_0516_100D9160305B8058"><Q>Whether the church of Rome was not degenerated from the church in the primitive times, from the Spirit, power, and practice that they were in in the apo&s;tles times?</Q> He to whom I put this que&s;tion, being &s;ubtle, &s;aid, <Q>He would not an&s;wer it.</Q> I a&s;ked him, Why? But he would &s;hew no rea&s;on. His companion &s;aid, he would an&s;wer me; and &s;aid, <Q>They were not degenerated from the church in the primitive times.</Q> I a&s;ked the other, <Q>Whether he was of the &s;ame mind? He &s;aid, Yes. Then I replied, for the better under&s;tanding one another, and that there might be no mi&s;take, I would repeat my que&s;tion over again after this manner: Whether the church of Rome now was in the &s;ame purity, practice, power, and Spirit, that the church in the apo&s;tles time was in?</Q> When they &s;aw we would be exact with them, they flew off, and denied that, &s;aying, <Q>It was pre&s;umption in any to &s;ay they had the &s;ame power and Spirit which the apo&s;tles had.</Q> I told them, It was pre&s;umption in them to meddle with the words of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, and make people believe they &s;ucceeded the apo&s;tles, yet be forced to confe&s;s, <Q>They were not in the &s;ame power and Spirit that the apo&s;tles were in:</Q> This, &s;aid I, is a &s;pirit of pre&s;umption, and rebuked by the apo&s;tles Spirit. I &s;hewed them how different their fruits and practices were from the fruits and practices of the apo&s;|tles. Then got up one of them, and &s;aid, <Q>Ye are a com|pany of dreamers.</Q> Nay, &s;aid I, ye are the filthy dream|ers, who dream ye are the apo&s;tles &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and yet con|fe&s;s, <Q>Ye have not the &s;ame power and Spirit which the apo&s;tles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere in.</Q> And are not they defilers of the fle&s;h, who &s;ay, <Q>It is pre&s;umption for any to &s;ay, they have the &s;ame power and Spirit which the apo&s;tles had?</Q> Now, &s;aid I, if ye have not the &s;ame power and Spirit which the apo&s;tles had, then it is manife&s;t that ye are led by another power and &s;pirit than the apo&s;tles and church in the primi|tive times were led by. Then I began to tell them how that evil &s;pirit, which they were led by, had led them to pray by beads and to images, and to &s;et up nunneries, fria|ries, and mona&s;teries, and to put people to death for reli|gion; which practice I &s;hewed them was below the law, and far &s;hort of the go&s;pel, in which is liberty. They were &s;oon weary of this di&s;cour&s;e, and went their way, and gave a charge, as we heard, to the Papi&s;ts, <Q>That they &s;hould not di&s;pute with us, nor read any of our books.</Q> So we were rid of them; but we had rea&s;onings with all the other
<PB N="440" REF="037441_0517_100D9161C52A72E0">&s;ects, Pre&s;byterians, Independents, Seekers, Bapti&s;ts, Epi&s;|copal-men Socinians, Browni&s;ts, Lutherans, Calvini&s;ts, Arminians, Fifth-monarchy-men, Famili&s;ts, Muggletonians, and Ranters; none of which would affirm they had the &s;ame power and Spirit that the apo&s;tles had and were in; &s;o in that power and Spirit the Lord gave us dominion over them all.</P>
<P>As for the Fifth-monarchy-men I was moved to give forth a paper, to manife&s;t their error to them; for they look|ed for Chri&s;t's per&s;onal coming in an outward form and manner, and fixed the time to the year 1666; at which time &s;ome of them prepared them&s;elves when it thundered and rained, thinking Chri&s;t was then come to &s;et up his king|dom, and they imagined they were to kill the whore with|out them. But I told them the whore was alive in them, and was not burned with God's fire, nor judged in them with the &s;ame power and Spirit the apo&s;tles were in. And their looking for Chri&s;t's coming outwardly to &s;et up his kingdom, was like the Phari&s;ees 'Lo here,' and 'Lo there.' But Chri&s;t was come and had &s;et up his kingdom above &s;ixteen hundred years ago (according to Nebuchadnezzar's dream and Daniel's prophecy) and he had da&s;hed to pieces the four monarchies, the great image, with its head of gold, brea&s;t and arms of &s;ilver, belly and thighs of bra&s;s, legs of iron, and feet part of iron part of clay; and they were all blown away with God's wind, as the chaff in the &s;ummer thre&s;hing-floor. And when Chri&s;t was on earth, he &s;aid, His kingdom was not of this world: if it had, his &s;ervants would have fought; but it was not, therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ervants did not fight. Therefore all the Fifth-monarchy men, that are fighters with carnal weapons, are none of Chri&s;t's &s;erv|ants, but the bea&s;t's and the whore's. Chri&s;t &s;aid, <Q>All power in heaven and in earth is given to me;</Q> &s;o then his kingdom was &s;et up above &s;ixteen hundred years ago, and he reigns. And we &s;ee Je&s;us Chri&s;t reign, &s;aid the apo&s;tle, and he &s;hall reign till all things be put under his feet; tho' all things are not yet put under his feet, nor &s;ubdued.</P>

<HEAD>A JOURNAL OR HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE, TRAVELS, SUFFERINGS, &amp;c. OF GEORGE FOX.</HEAD>
<P>THIS year &s;everal friends were moved to go beyond &s;ea, to publi&s;h truth in foreign countries. John Stubbs, Henry Fell, and Richard Co&s;trop were moved to go towards China and Pre&s;ter John's country; but no ma&s;ters of &s;hips would carry them. With much ado they got a warrant from the king; but the Ea&s;t-India company found ways to avoid it, and the ma&s;ters of their &s;hips would not carry them. Then they went into Holland, hoping to have got pa&s;&s;age there; but no pa&s;&s;age could they get there neither. Then John Stubbs and Henry Fell took &s;hipping for Alexandria in Egypt, intending to go by the caravans from thence. Meanwhile Daniel Baker being to go to Smyrna, drew Richard Co&s;trop, contrary to his own free|dom, along with them; and in the pa&s;&s;age, Richard falling &s;ick, D. Baker left him &s;ick in the &s;hip; where he died: but that hard-hearted man afterwards lo&s;t his own condition.</P>
<P>John Stubbs and Henry Fell got to Alexandria; but they had not been long there before the Engli&s;h con&s;ul bani&s;hed them from thence; yet before they came away, they di&s;per&s;ed many books and papers for the opening the principles and way of truth to the Turks and Grecians.
<PB N="4" REF="037441_0520_100D9165F4571FC8">They gave the book called, 'The Pope's &s;trength broken,' to an old friar, for him to give or &s;end to the pope; which book, when the friar had peru&s;ed, he clapped his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> up|on his brea&s;t, and confe&s;&s;ed, <Q>What was written therein was truth; but,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>if I &s;hould confe&s;s it openly, they would burn me.</Q> John Stubbs and Henry Fell, not being &s;uffered to go farther, returned to England, and came to London again. John had a vi&s;ion that the Engli&s;h and Dutch, who had joined together not to carry them, <Q>would fall out one with the other.</Q> And &s;o it came to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Having &s;taid in London &s;ome time. I felt drawings to vi&s;it friends in E&s;&s;ex. I went to Colche&s;ter, where I had very large meetings, and from thence to Cogge&s;hall; not far from which there was a prie&s;t convinced, and I had a meeting at his hou&s;e. So travelling a little in tho&s;e parts, vi&s;iting friends in their meetings, I returned pretty quickly to London, where I &s;ound great &s;ervice for the Lord; for a large door was opened, many &s;locked in to our meetings, and the Lord's truth &s;pread mightily this year. Yet friends had great travail and fore labour, the rude people having been &s;o heightened by the Monarchy-men's ri&s;ing a little before. But the Lord's power was over all, and in it friends had dominion though we had not only tho&s;e &s;ufferings without, but &s;ufferings within al&s;o, by John Perrot and his company; who giving heed to a &s;pirit of delu&s;ion, &s;ought to introduce among friends that evil and uncomely practice of 'keeping on the hat in the time of publick prayers.' Friends had &s;poken to him and divers of his followers about it, and I had written to them concerning it; but he and &s;ome others rather &s;trengthened them&s;elves again&s;t us. Wherefore feeling the judgment of truth ri&s;e again&s;t it, I gave forth the following lines, as a warning to all concerned therein.</P>

<P>WHOSOEVER is tainted with this &s;pirit of John Perrot, it will peri&s;h.

<P>Among the exerci&s;es and troubles that friends had from without, one was concerning friends marriages, which &s;ome|times were called in que&s;tion. In this year there happened to be a cau&s;e tried at the a&s;&s;ize at Nottingham concerning a friend's marriage. The ca&s;e was thus: Some years before two friends were joined together in marriage among&s;t friends, and lived together as man and wife about two years. Then the man died, leaving his wife with child, and leaving an e&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in lands of copyhold. When the woman was deli|vered, the jury pre&s;ented the child heir to its father's lands, and accordingly the child was admitted; afterwards another friend married the widow. And after that, a per&s;on near of kin to her former hu&s;band, brought his action again&s;t the friend who had la&s;t married her, endeavouring to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them, and deprive the child of the inheritance, and to po&s;|&s;e&s;s him&s;elf thereof, as next heir to the woman's fir&s;t hu&s;|band. To effect this, he endeavoured to prove the child illegitimate, alleging, <Q>The marriage was not according to law.</Q> In opening the cau&s;e, the plaintiff's coun&s;el u&s;ed un&s;eemly words concerning friends, &s;aying, <Q>they went to|gether like brute bea&s;ts,</Q> with other ill expre&s;&s;ions. After the coun&s;el on both &s;ides had pleaded, the judge, (viz. judge Archer) took the matter in hand, and opened it to them, telling them, <Q>There was a marriage in paradi&s;e when Adam took Eve, and Eve took Adam, and that it was the con&s;ent of the parties that made a marriage. And for the Quakers (he &s;aid) he did not know their opinions; but he did not believe they went together as brute bea&s;ts, as had been &s;aid of them, but as Chri&s;tians; and therefore he did believe the marriage was lawful, and the child lawful heir.</Q> The better to &s;atisfy the jury, he brought them a ca&s;e to this purpo&s;e, <Q>A man that was weak of body, and kept his bed, had a de&s;ire in that condition to marry, and did declare before witne&s;&s;es, that he did take &s;uch a woman to be his wife, and the woman declared that &s;he took that
<PB N="6" REF="037441_0522_100D916A64FEC788">man to be her hu&s;band. This marriage was afterwards called in que&s;tion, (and as the judge &s;aid) all the bi&s;hops did conclude it to be a lawful marriage.</Q> Hereupon the jury gave in their verdict for the friend's child again&s;t the man that would have deprived it of its inheritance.</P>
<P>About this time the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy were tendered to friends as a &s;nare, becau&s;e it was known we could not &s;wear, and thereupon many were impri&s;oned, and divers premunired. Upon that occa&s;ion friends pub|li&s;hed in print, <Q>The grounds and rea&s;ons why they re&s;u&s;ed to &s;wear;</Q> be&s;ides which, I was moved to give forth the&s;e few lines following, to be given to the magi&s;trates:</P>

<P>Abundance of friends being in pri&s;on, Richard Hubber|thorn and I drew up a paper concerning them; and got it delivered to the king, that he might under&s;tand how we were dealt with by his officers. It was directed thus:

<P>There were two of our friends in pri&s;on in the inqui&s;i|tion at Malta, both women; Catherine Evans and Sarah Chevers. I was told that one called the Lord D'Aubeny could procure their liberty; wherefore I went to him: and having informed him concerning their impri&s;onment, de&s;ir|ed him to write to the magi&s;trates there for their relea&s;e.

<P>ALL the &s;ufferings of the people of God in all ages were becau&s;e they could not join to the national re|ligions and wor&s;hips which men have made and &s;et up, and becau&s;e they would not for&s;ake God's religion and his wor&s;hip which he had &s;et up.

<P>After I had made &s;ome &s;tay in London, and had cleared my&s;elf of what lay upon me there, I went into the country, having with me Alexander Parker and John Stubbs. We
<PB N="10" REF="037441_0526_100D9172F1BE9A98">travelled through the country, vi&s;iting friends meetings, till we came to Bri&s;tol. There we under&s;tood, that the officers were likely to come and break up the meeting; yet on fir&s;t-day we went to the meeting at Broad-mead, and Alexander Parker &s;tanding up fir&s;t, while he was &s;peaking, the officers came and took him away. After he was gone, I &s;tood up and declared the everla&s;ting truth of the Lord God in his eternal power, which came over all, and the meeting was quiet the re&s;t of the time, and broke up peaceably. I tarried till fir&s;t-day following, vi&s;iting friends, and being vi&s;ited by friends. On fir&s;t-day morning &s;everal friends came to Ed|ward Pyot's (where I lay the night before) and u&s;ed endea|vours to per&s;uade me not to go to the meeting that day; for the magi&s;trates had threatened to take me, and had rai&s;|ed the trained-bands. I wi&s;hed them to go to the meeting, not telling them what I intended to do; but I told Edward Pyot I intended to go, and he &s;ent his &s;on to &s;hew me the way from his hou&s;e by the fields. As I went I met divers friends, who did what they could to &s;top me: 'What,' &s;aid one, 'wilt thou go into the mouth of the bea&s;t?' 'Wilt thou go into the mouth of the dragon?' &s;aid another. I put them by and went on. When I came to the meet|ing, Margaret Thomas was &s;peaking. When &s;he had done, I &s;tood up. I &s;aw a concern and fear upon friends for me; but the power of the Lord, in which I declared, &s;oon &s;truck the fear out of them. Life &s;prang, and an heavenly glori|ous meeting we had. After I had cleared my&s;elf of what was upon me from the Lord to the meeting, I was moved to pray, and after prayer to &s;tand up again, and tell friends, <Q>Now they might &s;ee there was a God in I&s;rael that could deliver.</Q> A very large meeting this was, and very hot; but truth was over all, and the life was exalted which car|ried through all, and the meeting broke up in peace. The officers and &s;oldiers had been breaking up another meeting, which had taken up their time; &s;o that our meeting was ended before they came. But I under&s;tood afterwards they were in a great rage, becau&s;e they had mi&s;&s;ed me; for they were heard to &s;ay one to another before, <Q>I'll warrant we &s;hall have him;</Q> but the Lord prevented them. I went to Joan Hily's, where many friends came to &s;ee me; re|joicing and ble&s;&s;ing God for our deliverance. In the even|ing I had a fine fre&s;h meeting at a friend's hou&s;e over the water, where we were much refre&s;hed in the Lord. After this I &s;taid mo&s;t part of that week in Bri&s;tol, and at Ed|ward
<PB N="11" REF="037441_0527_100D9174B541F4F8">Pyot's. Edward was brought &s;o low and weak with an ague, that when I fir&s;t came he was looked upon as a dying man; but it plea&s;ed the Lord to rai&s;e him up again, &s;o that, before I went away, his ague left him, and he was &s;inely well.</P>
<P>Having been two fir&s;t-days at the meeting at Broad|mead. and feeling my &s;pirit clear of Bri&s;tol. I went next fir&s;t-day to a meeting in the country not far di&s;tant. And after the meeting. &s;ome friends from Bri&s;tol told me, the &s;oldiers that day had be&s;et the meeting-hou&s;e round at Bri&s;|tol, and then went up, &s;aying. <Q>They would be &s;ure to have me now;</Q> but when they found me not there, they were in a great rage, and kept friends in the meeting-hou&s;e mo&s;t part of the day before they would let them go home; and queried of them, Which way I was gone, and how 'they might &s;end after me? For the mayor,' they &s;aid, 'would fain have &s;poken with me.' I had a vi&s;ion of a great ma&s;tiff dog, that would have bit me; but I put one hand above his jaws, and the other hand below, and tore his jaws in pieces. So the Lord by his power tore their power to pieces, and made way for me to e&s;cape them. Then I pa&s;&s;ed through the country, vi&s;iting friends in Wilt|&s;hire and Berk&s;hire, till I came to London, having great meetings among&s;t friends as I went. The Lord's power was over all, and a ble&s;&s;ed time it was for the &s;preading of his glorious truth. It was indeed the immediate power of the Lord that pre&s;erved me out of their hands at Bri&s;tol, and over the heads of all our per&s;ecutors; and the Lord alone is worthy of all the glory, who did uphold and pre|&s;erve for his name and truth's &s;ake.</P>
<P>At London I &s;taid not long, being drawn in &s;pirit to vi&s;it friends northward as far as Leice&s;ter&s;hire. John Stubbs was with me. We travelled down, having meetings among&s;t friends as we went; and at Skegby we had a great meet|ing. Thence we came to Barnet-hills, where lived captain Brown, a Bapti&s;t, who&s;e wife was convinced of truth. This captain Brown, after the act for 'breaking up meetings' came forth, being afraid his wife &s;hould go to meetings, and be ca&s;t into pri&s;on, left his hou&s;e at Barrow, and took a place on the&s;e hills, &s;aying, 'His wife &s;hould not go to pri&s;on.' And this being a free place, many prie&s;ts and others fled thither as well as he. But he, who would neither &s;tand to truth him&s;elf nor &s;uffer his wife, was in this place, where he thought him&s;elf &s;afe, found out by the Lord, who&s;e hand
<PB N="12" REF="037441_0528_100D9176B17894D0">fell heavy upon him for his unfaithfulne&s;s; &s;o that he was &s;orely plagued, and grievou&s;ly judged in him&s;elf for flying and drawing his wife into that private place. We went to &s;ee his wife, and being in the hou&s;e, I a&s;ked him, how he did? 'How do I!' &s;aid he, <Q>The plagues and vengeance of God are upon me, a runagate, a Cain as I am. God may look for a witne&s;s for me, and &s;uch as me; for if all were not faithfuller than I, God would have no witne&s;s left in the earth.</Q> In this condition he lived on bread and water, and thought it was too good for him. At length he got home again with his wife to his own hou&s;e at Barrow, where afterwards he was convinced of God's eternal truth, and died in it. A little before his death he &s;aid, <Q>Though he had not borne a te&s;timony for truth in his life, he would bear a te&s;timony in his death, and would be buried in his orchard;</Q> and was &s;o. He was an example to all the flying Bapti&s;ts in the time of per&s;ecution, who could not bear per&s;ecution them&s;elves, yet per&s;ecuted us when they had power.</P>
<P>From Barnet-hills we came to Swanington, in Leice&s;ter|&s;hire, where William Smith and &s;ome, other friends vi&s;ited me; but went away towards night, leaving me at a friend's hou&s;e in Swanington. At night, as I was &s;itting in the hall, &s;peaking to a widow-woman and her daughter, lord Beaumont came with a company, of &s;oldiers, who, &s;lapping their &s;words on the door, ru&s;hed into the hou&s;e with &s;words and pi&s;tols in their hands, crying, <Q>Put out the candles, and make fa&s;t the doors.' Then they &s;eized upon the friends in the hou&s;e, and a&s;ked, If there were no more about the hou&s;e?</Q> The friends told them, there was one man more in the hall. There being &s;ome friends out of Derby&s;hire, one of them was named Thomas Fauks; lord Beaumont, after he had a&s;ked all their names, bid his man &s;et down that man's name Thomas Fox. The friend &s;aid, Nay, his name was not Fox, but Fauks. In the mean time &s;ome of the &s;oldiers came, and fetched me out of the hall to him. He a&s;ked my name. I told him my name was George Fox, and that I was well known by that name. 'Aye,' &s;aid he, 'you are known all the world over.' I &s;aid, I was known for no hurt, but for good. Then he put his hands into my pockets to &s;earch them, and plucked out my comb-ca&s;e, and afterwards commanded one of his offi|cers to &s;earch further for letters. I told him, I was no let|ter-carrier, and a&s;ked him, Why he came among&s;t a peace|able
<PB N="13" REF="037441_0529_100D917998752778">people with &s;words and pi&s;tols, without a con&s;table, contrary to the king's proclamation and to the late act? For he could not &s;ay, there was a meeting, I being only talking with a poor widow-woman and her daughter. By rea&s;oning thus with him, he came &s;omewhat down; yet &s;ending for the con&s;tables, he gave them charge of us that night, and to bring us before him next morning. Accord|ingly the con&s;tables &s;et a watch of the town's people upon us that night, and had us next morning to his hou&s;e about a mile from Swanington. When we came before him, he told us, 'We met contrary to the Act.' I de&s;ired him to &s;hew us the act. 'Why,' &s;ays he, <Q>you have it in your pocket.</Q> I told him, he did not find us in a meeting. Then he a&s;ked, <Q>Whether we would take the oaths of alle|giance and &s;upremacy?</Q> I told him, I never took any oath in my life, nor engagement, nor the covenant. Yet &s;till he would force the oath upon us. I de&s;ired him to &s;hew us the oath, that we might &s;ee whether we were the per&s;ons it was to be tendered to, and whether it was not for the di&s;covery of popi&s;h recu&s;ants. At length he brought a little book, but we called for the &s;tatute-book. He would not &s;hew us that, but cau&s;ed a mittimus to be made, which mentioned, 'That we were to have had a meeting.' With this mittimus he delivered us to the con&s;tables to convey us to Leice&s;ter gaol. But when the con&s;tables had brought us back to Swanington, being harve&s;t-time, it was hard to get any body to go with us. The people were loth to take their neighbours to pri&s;on, e&s;pecially in &s;uch a bu&s;y time. They would have given us our mittimus to have carried our&s;elves to the gaol; for it had been u&s;ual for con&s;tables to give friends their own mittimu&s;es, and they have gone them&s;elves with them to the gaoler. But we told them, though our friends had &s;ometimes done &s;o, we would not take this mittimus; but &s;ome of them &s;hould go with us to the gaol. At la&s;t they hired a poor labouring man, who was loth to go, though hired. So we rode to Leice&s;ter, being five in number; &s;ome carried their bible<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> open in their hands, declaring truth to the people as we rode in the fields and through the towns, and telling them, <Q>We were pri&s;oners of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, going to &s;uffer bonds for his name and trutl &s;ake.</Q> One woman friend carried her wheel on her lap to &s;pin on in pri&s;on, and the people were mightily affected. At Leice&s;ter we went to an inn, The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e &s;eemed to be troubled that we
<PB N="14" REF="037441_0530_100D917B28240FE0">&s;hould go to pri&s;on; and being him&s;elf in commi&s;&s;ion, he &s;ent for lawyers in the town to advi&s;e with, and would have taken up the mittimus, and kept us in his own hou&s;e, and not have let us gone into the gaol. But I told friends, it would be great charge to lie at an inn, many friends and people would come to vi&s;it us, and it might be hard for him to bear meetings in his hou&s;e: be&s;ides, we had many friends in the pri&s;on already, and we had rather be with them. So we let the man know we were &s;en&s;ible of his kindne&s;s, and to pri&s;on we went; the poor man that brought us thither delivering both the mittimus and us to the gaoler. This gaoler had been a very wicked, cruel man. Six or &s;even friends being in pri&s;on before we came, he had taken &s;ome occa&s;ion to quarrel with them, and had thru&s;t them into the dungcon among&s;t felons, where was hardly room for them to lie down. We &s;taid all that day in the pri&s;on|yard. and de&s;ired the gaoler to let us have &s;ome &s;traw. He &s;urlily an&s;wered, <Q>You do not look like men that would lie on &s;traw.</Q> After awhile William Smith came to me, and being acquainted in the hou&s;e, I a&s;ked him, What rooms were in the hou&s;e, and what rooms friends had been u&s;ually put in before they were put into the dungeon? I a&s;ked him al&s;o, Whether the gaoler or his wife was ma&s;ter? He &s;aid, The wife was ma&s;ter; and though &s;he was lame, and &s;ate mo&s;tly in her chair, not being able to go but on crutches, yet &s;he would beat her hu&s;band when he came within her reach, if he did not as &s;he would have him. I con&s;idered that many friends might probably come to vi&s;it us, and if we had a room to our&s;elves, it would be better for them to &s;peak to me, and for me to &s;peak to them in, as there &s;hould be occa&s;ron. Wherefore I de&s;ired William Smith to &s;peak with the woman, and acquaint her, if &s;he would let us have a room, &s;uffer our friends to come out of the dungeon, and leave it to us to give her what we would, it might be better for her. He went, and after &s;ome rea&s;oning with her &s;he con&s;ented; and we were had into a room. Then we were told, The gaoler would not &s;uffer us to have any drink out of the town into the pri&s;on, but what beer we drank we mu&s;t take of him. I told them, I would remedy that if they would; for we would get a pail of water, and a little wormwood once a day, and that might &s;erve us; &s;o we &s;hould have none of his beer, and the water he could not deny us.</P>
<P>Before we came, when tho&s;e &s;ew friends that were pri|&s;oners
<PB N="15" REF="037441_0531_100D917CC210F610">met together on fir&s;t-days, if any of them was moved to pray to the Lord, the gaoler would come up with his quarter-&s;taff in his hand, and his ma&s;tiff-dog at his heels, and pluck them down by the hair of the head, and &s;trike them with his &s;taff; but when he &s;truck friends, the ma&s;tiff+dog, in&s;tead of falling upon them, would take the &s;taff out of his hand. When fir&s;t-day came, I &s;poke to one of my fellow-pri&s;oners to carr, a &s;tool and &s;et it in the yard, and give notice to the debtors and felons that there would be a meeting in the yard, and they that would hear the word of the Lord declared might come thither. So the pri&s;oners gathered in the yard, and we went down and had a very precious meeting, the gaoler not meddling. Thus every fir&s;t-day we had a meeting as long as we &s;taid in pri&s;on, and &s;everal came out of the town and country. Many were convinced, and &s;ome received the Lord's truth there, who &s;tood faithful witne&s;&s;es for it ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>When the &s;e&s;&s;ions came, we were brought before the ju&s;|tices, with more friends, to the number of about twenty. Being brought into the court, the gaoler put us in the place where the thieves were, and &s;ome of the ju&s;tices began to tender the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy to us. I told them, I never took any oath in my life; and they knew we could not &s;wear, becau&s;e Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tle forbad it: therefore they put it but as a &s;nare to us. We told them, if they could prove, that after Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tle had forbid &s;wearing, they did ever command Chri&s;tians to &s;wear, we would take the&s;e oaths; otherwi&s;e we were re&s;olved to obey Chri&s;t's command and the apo&s;tle's exhortation. They &s;aid, <Q>We mu&s;t take the oath, that we might manife&s;t our allegiance to the king.</Q> I told them, I had been formerly &s;ent pri&s;oner by col. Hacker from that town to London, under pretence that I held meetings to plot to bring in king Charles. I al&s;o de&s;ired them to read our mittimus, which &s;et forth the cau&s;e of our commitment to be, that 'we were to have a meeting;' and I &s;aid, lord Beaumont could not by that act &s;end us to gaol, unle&s;s we had been taken at a meeting, and found to be &s;uch per&s;ons as the act &s;peaks of; therefore we de&s;ired they would read the mitti|mus, and &s;ee how wrongfully we were impri&s;oned. They would not take notice of the mittimus; but called a jury, and indicted us <Q>for refu&s;ing to take the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy.</Q> When the jury was &s;worn and in&s;truct|ed, as they were going out, one who had been an alderman
<PB N="16" REF="037441_0532_100D917EB9CA5B78">of the city bid them, 'Have a good con&s;cience;' and one of the jury, being a peevi&s;h man, to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the ju&s;tices, there was one affronted the jury; whereupon they called him up, and tendered him the oath al&s;o, which he to.</P>
<P>While we were &s;tanding where the thieves u&s;ed to &s;tand, a cut-pur&s;e had his hand in &s;everal friends pockets. Friends declared it to the ju&s;tices, and &s;hewed them the man. They called him up before them, and upon examination he could not deny it; yet they &s;et him at liberty.</P>
<P>It was not long before the jury returned, and brought us in guilty; and after &s;ome words, the ju&s;tices whi&s;pered to|gether, and bid the gaoler take us to pri&s;on again; but the Lord's power was over them, and his everla&s;ting truth, which we declared boldly among&s;t them. There being a great concour&s;e of people, mo&s;t of them followed us; &s;o that the crier and bailiffs were fain to call the people back again to the court. We declared the truth as we went along the &s;treets, till we came to the gaol, the &s;treets being full of people. When we were in our chamber again, after &s;ome time the gaoler came to us, and de&s;ired all to go forth that were not pri&s;oners. When they were gone, he &s;aid, <Q>Gen|tlemen, it is the court's plea&s;ure that ye &s;hould be &s;et at liberty, except tho&s;e that are in for tithes: and you know there are fees due to me; but I &s;hall leave it to you to give me what you will.</Q></P>
<P>Thus we were all &s;et at liberty on a &s;udden, and pa&s;&s;ed every one into our &s;ervices. Leonard Fell went with me again to Swanington. I had a letter from lord Ha&s;tings, who hearing of my impri&s;onment had wrote from London to the ju&s;tices of the &s;e&s;&s;ions to &s;et me at liberty. I had not delivered this letter to the ju&s;tices; but whether they had any knowledge of his mind from any other hand, which made them di&s;charge us &s;o &s;uddenly, I know not. But his letter I carried to lord Beaumont, who &s;ent us to pri&s;on; and when he had broke it open and read it, he &s;eemed much troubled; but at la&s;t came a little lower; yet threatened us, if we had any more meetings at Swanington, he would break them up and fend us to pri&s;on again. But notwith&s;tanding his threats we went to Swanington, and had a meeting with friends there, and he neither came nor &s;ent to break it up.</P>
<P>From Swanington we came to Twy-cro&s;s, where that great man formerly mentioned, whom the Lord rai&s;ed up from his &s;ickne&s;s in the year 1649 (who&s;e &s;erving-man came at me with a drawn &s;word to have done me a mi&s;chief) and
<PB N="17" REF="037441_0533_100D9180B2199F60">his wife came to &s;ee me. From thence we travelled through Warwick&s;hire, where we had brave meetings; and into Northampton&s;hire and Bedford&s;hire, vi&s;iting friends till we came to London.</P>
<P>I &s;taid not long in London, but went into E&s;&s;ex, and &s;o to Nor&s;olk, having great meetings. At Norwich, when I came to captain Lawrence's, there was a great threatening of di&s;turbance; but the meeting was quiet. Pa&s;&s;ing from thence to Sutton, and into Cambridge&s;hire, I heard of Ed|ward Burrough's decea&s;e. And being &s;en&s;ible how great a grief and exerci&s;e it would be to friends to part with him, I wrote the following lines for the &s;taying and &s;ettling of their minds.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>From thence I pa&s;&s;ed to Little-port and the I&s;le of Ely; where one that had been the mayor, with his wife, and the wife of the then pre&s;ent mayor of Cambridge, came to the meeting. Travelling into Lincoln&s;hire and Huntingdon|&s;hire. I came to Thomas Parnel's, where the mayor of Hun|tingdon came to &s;ee me, and was very loving. From thence I came into the Fen-country, where we had large and quiet meetings. While I was in that country, there came &s;o great a flood, that it was dangerous to go out; yet we did get out, and went to Lynn, where we had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting. Next morning I went to vi&s;it &s;ome pri&s;oners there; then back to the inn, and took hor&s;e. As I was riding out of the yard, the officers came to &s;earch the inn for me. I knew nothing of it then, only I felt a great burden come upon me as I rode out of the town, till I was got without the gates. When &s;ome friends that came after overtook me, they told me their officers had been &s;earching for me in the inn, as &s;oon as I was gone out of the yard. So by the good hand of the Lord I e&s;caped their cruel hands. After this we pa&s;&s;ed through the countries, vi&s;iting friends in their meetings.
<PB N="18" REF="037441_0534_100D9182F7F4BCD0">The Lord's power carried us over the per&s;ecuting &s;pirits, and through many dangers; and his truth &s;pread and grew, and friends were e&s;tabli&s;hed therein: prai&s;es and glory to his name for ever!</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed through Norfolk, Suffolk, E&s;&s;ex, and Hertford&s;hire, we came to London again; where I &s;taid awhile, vi&s;iting friends in their meetings, which were very large, and the Lord's power was over all. After &s;ome time I left the city, and travelled into Kent, having Thomas Briggs with me. We went to A&s;hford, where we had a qui|et and a very ble&s;&s;ed meeting. On fir&s;t-day we bad a very good and peaceable meeting at Cranbrook. Then we went to Tenterden, and had a meeting there, to which friends came from &s;everal parts; and many other people came in and were reached by the truth. When the meeting was done, I walked with Thomas Briggs into a clo&s;e, while our hor&s;es were getting ready; and turning my head, I e&s;pied a captain coming, and a great company of &s;oldiers with light|ed matches and mu&s;kets. Some of the &s;oldiers came to Tho|mas and me, and &s;aid, 'We mu&s;t go to their captain.' When they had brought us before him, he a&s;ked, <Q>Where was George Fox? Which was he? I &s;aid, I am the man.</Q> <Q>Then he came to me, and was &s;omewhat &s;truck, and &s;aid, I will &s;ecure you among the &s;oldiers.</Q> So he called for the &s;oldiers to take me. Then he took Thomas Briggs and the man of the hou&s;e, with many more; but the power of the Lord was mightily over them all. Then he came to me again, and &s;aid, 'I mu&s;t go along with him to the town;' and he carried him&s;elf pretty civilly, bidding the &s;oldiers bring the re&s;t after. As we walked, I a&s;ked him, <Q>Why they did thus? for I had not &s;een &s;o much ado a great while;</Q> and I bid him be civil to his peaceable neighbours. When we were come to the town, they had us to an inn that was the gaoler's hou&s;e. After awhile the mayor of the town, this captain, and the lieutenant, who were ju&s;ti|ces, came together and examined me, <Q>Why I came thither to make a di&s;turbance?</Q> I told them, I did not come to make a di&s;turbance, neither had I made any di&s;turbance &s;ince I came. They &s;aid, <Q>There was a law again&s;t the Quakers meetings, made only again&s;t them.</Q> I told them, I knew no &s;uch law. Then they brought the act made again&s;t Qurakers and others. I told them, that was again&s;t &s;uch as were a <Q>terror to the king's &s;ubjects, who were ene|mies, and held principles dangerous to the government;</Q>
<PB N="19" REF="037441_0535_100D9184906E67D8">and therefore it was not again&s;t us, for we held the truth; our principles were not dangerous, and our meeting were peaceable, as they knew, who knew their neighbours were a peaceable people. They told me, <Q>I was an enemy to the king.</Q> I an&s;wered, We loved all people, were enemies to none, and that I had been ca&s;t into Derby dungcon about the time of Worce&s;ter fight, becau&s;e I would not take up arms again&s;t him; and that I was afterwards brought by colonel Hacker to London, as a plotter to bring in king Charles, and was kept pri&s;oner at London till I was &s;et at liberty by Oliver. They a&s;ked me, <Q>Whether I was im|pri&s;oned in the time of the in&s;urrection?</Q> I &s;aid, Yes; I had been impri&s;oned then and &s;ince, and had been &s;et at liberty by the king's own command. I opened the act to them, &s;hewed them the king's late declaration, gave them the examples of other ju&s;tices, and told them al&s;o what the hou&s;e of lords had &s;aid of it. I &s;poke al&s;o to them con|cerning their own conditions, exhorting them to live in the fear of God, to be tender towards their neighbours that fear|ed God, and to mind God's wi&s;dom by which all things were made and created, that they might come to receive it, be ordered by it, and by it order all things to God's glory. They demanded bond of us for our appearance at the &s;e&s;|&s;ions; but we, pleading our innocency, refu&s;ed to give bond. Then they would have us promi&s;e to come no more there; but we kept clear of that al&s;o. When they &s;aw they could not bring us to their terms, they told us, <Q>We &s;hould &s;ee they were civil to us, for it was the mayor's plea&s;ure we &s;hould all be &s;et at liberty.</Q> I told them, their civility was noble; and &s;o we parted.</P>
<P>Leaving Tenterden, we went to Newick in Su&s;&s;ex, where we vi&s;ited &s;ome friends. From thence we pa&s;&s;ed through the country, &s;i&s;iting friends, and having great meetings; all quiet and free from di&s;turbance (except by &s;ome jangling Bapti&s;ts) till we came into Hamp&s;hire. Where, after a good meeting at Southampton, we went to Pulner, in the pari&s;h of Ringwood, where was to be a monthly meeting next day, to which many friends re&s;orted from Southampton, Pool, and other places; and the weather being very hot, &s;ome came pretty early in the morning. I took a friend, and walked out with him into the orchard, enquiring of him how the affairs of truth &s;tood among&s;t them? (For many of them had been convinced by me before I was pri|&s;oner
in Cornwall.) While we were di&s;cour&s;ing, a young
<PB N="20" REF="037441_0536_100D9187204A47F8">man came and told us the trained bands were rai&s;ing, and he heard they would break up the meeting. It was not yet meeting-time by about three hours, and there being other friends walking in the orchard, the friend I was di&s;|cour&s;ing with before de&s;ired me to walk into a corn-field adjoining to it, which we did. After awhile, the young man that &s;poke of the trained bands left us, and when he was gone a pretty way he &s;tood and waved his hat. Where|upon I &s;poke to the other young man that was with me to go &s;ee what he meant. He went, but came not to me again, for the &s;oldiers were come into the orchard. As I kept walking I could &s;ee the &s;oldiers, and &s;ome of them, as I heard afterwards, did &s;ee me, but had no mind to meddle. So the &s;oldiers coming &s;o long before meeting-time, did not tarry; but took what friends they found at the hou&s;e, and &s;ome they met in the lane, and had them away. After they were gone, it drew towards the eleventh hour, friends began to come in apace, and a large and glorious meeting we had; for the everla&s;ting &s;eed of God was &s;et over all, and the peo|ple were &s;ettled in the new covenant of life, upon the foun|dation Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Towards the latter end of the meeting there came a man in gay apparel, and looked in while I was declaring, and went away again pre&s;ently. This man came with an evil intent; for he went forthwith to Ringwood, and told the magi&s;trates, <Q>That they had taken two or three men at Pulner, and had left George Fox there preaching to two or three hundred.</Q> Upon this the magi&s;trates &s;ent the officers and &s;oldiers again; but the meeting being near ended when the man looked in, and he having about a mile and a half to go with his information to fetch the &s;oldiers, and they as far to come after they had received their orders, before they came our meeting was over; ending about the third hour peaceably and orderly. After the meeting, I &s;poke to the friends of the hou&s;e where this was held (the woman of the hou&s;e then lying dead in the hou&s;e) and then &s;ome friends led me to another friend's at a little di&s;tance; where after we had refre&s;hed our&s;elves, I took hor&s;e, having about twenty miles to ride that afternoon to one&mdash; Frye's. in Wilt&s;hire, where a meeting was appointed to be held the next day.</P>
<P>After we were gone, the officers and &s;oldiers came in a great heat, who finding they had mi&s;&s;ed their prey were much enraged; and the officers were offended with the &s;ol|diers, becau&s;e they had not &s;eized my hor&s;e in the &s;table
<PB N="21" REF="037441_0537_100D918969B667E0">the fir&s;t time they came. But the Lord, by his good pro|vidence, delivered me, and prevented their mi&s;chievous de|&s;ign. For the officers were envious men, and had an evil mind again&s;t friends; but the Lord brought his judgments upon them, &s;o that it was taken notice of by their neigh|bours. For <Q>as before they were wealthy men, after this their e&s;tates wa&s;ted away; and John Line, the con&s;table, who was not only very forward in putting on the &s;oldiers to take friends, but al&s;o carried tho&s;e that were taken to pri&s;on, and took a fal&s;e oath again&s;t them at the a&s;&s;ize, upon which they were fined and continued pri&s;oners, was a &s;ad &s;pectacle to behold. For his fle&s;h rotting away while he lived, he died in a very mi&s;erable condition, wi&s;hing he had never meddled with the Quakers, and confe&s;&s;ing he never pro&s;pered &s;ince he had an hand in per&s;ecuting them; and that he thought the hand of the Lord was again&s;t him for it.</Q></P>
<P>At&mdash;Frye's in Wilt&s;hire we had a very ble&s;&s;ed meet|ing, and quiet, though the officers purpo&s;ed to have broken it up, and were on their way in order thereunto. But be|fore they were got to the meeting, word was brought them, <Q>There was a hou&s;e newly broken up by thieves, and they were required to go back again with &s;peed to &s;earch after and pur&s;ue them;</Q> by which means our meeting e&s;caped di&s;turbance, and we were pre&s;erved out of their hands.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed through Wilt&s;hire into Dor&s;et&s;hire, having large and good meetings. The Lord's everla&s;ting power was with us, and carried us over all; in which we &s;ounded forth his &s;aving truth and word of life, which many gladly received. Thus we vi&s;ited friends till we came to Top&s;ham, in Devon&s;hire, travelling &s;ome weeks eight or nine &s;core miles a week, and had meetings every day. At Top&s;ham we met with Margaret Fell and two of her daughters, Sa|rah and Mary, and with Leonard Fell and Thomas Salt|hou&s;e. From thence we pa&s;&s;ed to Totne&s;s, where we vi&s;ited &s;ome friends, and then to King&s;bridge, and to Henry Pol|lexfen's, who had been an ancient ju&s;tice of peace. There we had a large meeting. This old ju&s;tice accompanied us to Plymouth, and into Cornwall, to ju&s;tice Porter's, and from thence to Thomas Mount's, where we had a large meeting. After which we went to Humphry Lower's, where al&s;o we had a large meeting; and from thence to Loveday Hambley's, where we had a general meeting for the whole country: and all was quiet.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="037441_0538_100D918AF9B06308">
A little before this, Jo&s;eph Hellen, and G. Bewley had been at Loo to vi&s;it Blanch Pope, a Ranting woman, un|der pretence to convince and convert her: but before they left her, &s;he had &s;o darkened them with her principles, that they &s;eemed to be like her di&s;ciples, e&s;pecially Jo&s;eph Hel|len. She a&s;ked them, <Q>Who made the devil? Did not God?</Q> This idle que&s;tion &s;o puzzled them, they could not an&s;wer her. They afterwards a&s;ked me the que&s;tion. I told them, No; for all that God made was good and was ble&s;t, &s;o was not the devil. He was called a &s;erpent before he was called a devil and an adver&s;ary and then he had the title of devil given him. Afterwards he was called a dragon, becau&s;e he was a de&s;troyer. The devil abode not in the truth: by departing from the truth he became a de|vil. So the Jews, when they went out of the truth, were &s;aid to be of the devil, and were called &s;erpents. There is no promi&s;e of God to the devil, that ever he &s;hall return into truth again; but to man and woman, who have been deceived by him, the promi&s;e of God is, that <Q>The &s;eed of the woman &s;hall brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head;</Q> &s;hall break his power and &s;trength to pieces. When the&s;e things were opened more at large to the &s;atisfaction of friends, tho&s;e two, who had let up the &s;pirit of that ranting woman, were judged by the truth; and one of them, viz. Jo&s;eph Hellen, ran quite out, and was denied by friends; but Georgo Bewly was recovered, and afterwards became &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed from Loveday Hambley's to Francis Hodges's, near Falmouth and Penryn, where we had a large meeting. From thence we went to Hel&s;tone that night, where friends came to vi&s;it us, and next day pa&s;&s;ed to Thomas Teage's, where we had a large meeting, at which many were con|vinced. I was led to open <Q>the &s;tate of the church in the primitive times, the &s;tate of the church in the wilderne&s;s, the &s;tate of the fal&s;e church that was got up &s;ince; and to &s;hew, that now the everla&s;ting go&s;pel was preached over the head of the whore, bea&s;t, fal&s;e prophets, and anti|chri&s;ts, which had ro&s;e up &s;ince the apo&s;tles days; and now the everla&s;ting go&s;pel was received and receiving, which brought life and immortality to light, that they might &s;ee over the devil who had darkened them.</Q> The people received the go&s;pel and the word of life gladly, and a glorious ble&s;&s;ed meeting we had for the exalting the Lord's everla&s;ting truth and his name. After it was done I walked out, and coming in again, I heard a noi&s;e in the court.
<PB N="23" REF="037441_0539_100D918D4B92D460">Approaching nearer, I found the man of the hou&s;e &s;peaking to the tinners and others, telling them, It was the <Q>ever|la&s;ting truth that had been declared there that day;</Q> and the people generally confe&s;&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>From thence we pa&s;&s;ed to the Land's-end to John Ellis's, where we had a precious meeting. Here was a fi&s;herman, Nicholas Jo&s;e, that was convinced. He &s;poke in meetings, and declared the truth among&s;t the people; and the Lord's power was over all. I was glad the Lord rai&s;ed up his &s;tandard in tho&s;e dark parts of the nation, where &s;ince there is a fine meeting of hone&s;t-hearted friends; many are come to &s;it under Chri&s;t's teaching, and a great people the Lord will have in that country.</P>
<P>From thence we returned to Redruth, and the next day to Truro, where we had a meeting. Next morning, &s;ome of the chief of the town de&s;ired to &s;peak with me, among&s;t whom was colonel Rou&s;e. I went, and had a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e with them concerning the things of God. In their rea&s;oning they &s;aid, <Q>The go&s;pel was the four books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John;</Q> and they called it natural. I told them, the go&s;pel was the power of God, which was preached before Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John were written; and it was preached to every creature (of which a great part might never &s;ee nor hear of tho&s;e four books) &s;o that every creature was to obey the power of God; for Chri&s;t, the Spiritual Man, would judge the world ac|cording to the go&s;pel, that is, according to his invi&s;ible power. When they heard this, they could not gain&s;ay; for the truth came over them. I directed them to their teacher, the grace of God, and &s;hewed them the &s;ufficiency of it, which would teach them how to live, and what to deny; and being obeyed would bring them &s;alvation. So to that grace I recommended them, and left them.</P>
<P>Then we returned through the country, vi&s;iting friends, and had meetings at Humphrey Lower's and Thomas Mount's. Afterwards at, George Hawkins's at Stoke we had a large meeting, to which friends came from Lance&s;ton and &s;everal other places. A living, precious meeting it was, in which the Lord's pre&s;ence and power was richly manife&s;ted among&s;t us, and I left friends there under the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t's teaching.</P>
<P><Q>In Cornwall I was informed there was one colonel Ro|bin&s;on, a very wicked man, who after the king came in was made a ju&s;tice of peace, and became a cruel per&s;e|cutor
<PB N="24" REF="037441_0540_100D918FA1B13A98">of friends; of whom he &s;ent many to pri&s;on. Hear|ing they had &s;ome little liberty, through the favour of the gaoler, to go home &s;ometimes to vi&s;it their wives and children, he made great complaint thereof to the judge at the a&s;&s;ize again&s;t the gaoler: whereupon the gaoler was fined an hundred marks and friends were kept very &s;trict|ly up for awhile. After he was come home from the a&s;|&s;ize, he &s;ent to a neighbouring ju&s;tice to de&s;ire him to go a fanatick-hunting with him. He &s;ent his man about with his hor&s;es, and walked him&s;elf on foot from his dwel|ling-hou&s;e to a tenement where his cows and dairy were kept, and where his &s;ervants were then milking. When he came there, he a&s;ked for his bull. The &s;ervant-maids &s;aid, They had &s;hut him into the field becau&s;e he was un|r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, and hindered their milking. Then went he into the field to the bull; and having formerly accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to play with him he began to &s;ence at him with his &s;taff. But the bull &s;nuffed at him, and pa&s;&s;ed a little back; then turning upon him again, ran fiercely at him, and &s;truck his horn into his thigh, and heaving him upon his horn, threw him over his back, and tore up his thigh to his belly. When he came to the ground again he gored him with his horns run them into the ground in his rage and violence, and roared, and licked up his ma&s;ter's blood. The maid|&s;ervant, hearing her ma&s;ter cry out, ran into the field, and took the bull by the horns to pull him off from her ma&s;ter. The bull, without hurting her, put her gently by with his horns, but &s;till fell to goring of him, and licking up his blood. Then &s;he ran, and got &s;ome men that were at work not far off, to come and re&s;cue her ma&s;ter; but they could not at all beat off the bull, till they brought ma&s;tiff|dogs to &s;et on him; and then he fled in great rage and fu|ry. Upon notice of it his &s;i&s;ter came, and &s;aid to him, <Q>Alack! brother, what a heavy judgment is this that is befallen you!</Q> He an&s;wered, <Q>Ah! &s;i&s;ter, it is an hea|vy judgment indeed.</Q> Pray let the bull be killed, and the fle&s;h given to the poor, &s;aid he. They carried him home; but he died &s;oon after. The bull was grown &s;o fierce, they were forced to &s;hoot him with guns; for no man dur&s;t come near to kill him. Thus does the Lord &s;ometimes make examples of his ju&s;t judgment upon the per&s;ecutors of his people, that others may fear, and learn to beware.</Q></P>
<P>After I had cleared my&s;elf of Cornwall, and Thomas
<PB N="25" REF="037441_0541_100D9191B6D66FD8">Lower had brought us over Hor&s;e-bridge into Devon&s;hire again, we took our leave of him. Thomas Briggs, Robert Widders, and I came to Tiverton. It being their fair|time, and many friends there, we had a meeting among&s;t them; and the magi&s;trates gathered in the &s;treet, but the Lord's power &s;topped them. I &s;aw them over again&s;t the door; but they had not power to come in to meddle with us, though they had will enough to have done it.</P>
<P>After the meeting we pa&s;&s;ed to Collumpton and Wel|lington; for we had appointed a meeting five miles off, where we had a large one at a butcher's hou&s;e, and a ble&s;|&s;ed meeting it was. The people were directed to their Teacher, the Grace of God, which would bring them &s;alvation, and many were &s;ettled under its teaching. The Lord's pre&s;ence was among&s;t us, and we were refre&s;hed in him, in whom we laboured and travailed; and the meeting was quiet. There had been very great per&s;ecution in that country, and in that town a little before, in&s;omuch that &s;ome friends que&s;tioned the peaceablene&s;s of our meeting; but the Lord's power chained all, and his glory &s;hined over all. Friends told us, how they had broken up their meet|ings by warrants from the ju&s;tices, and how by their war|rants they were required to carry friends before the ju&s;ti|ces. The friends bid them, Carry them then. The officers told them, they mu&s;t Go; but they &s;aid, Nay, that was not according to their warrants, which required them to carry them. Then they were forced to hire carts, waggons, and hor&s;es, and to lift them into their waggons and carts to carry them before a ju&s;tice. When they came to a ju&s;tice's hou&s;e, &s;ometimes he happened to be from home, or if he was a moderate man he would get out of the way, and then they were obliged to carry them before another; &s;o that they were many days carting and carrying friends up and down from place to place. And when afterwards the officers came to lay their charges for this upon the town, the town's people would not pay it, but made them bear it them&s;elves, which broke the neck of their per&s;ecution there for that time. The like was done in &s;everal other places, till the officers had &s;hamed and tired them&s;elves, and then were glad to give over.</P>
<P>At one place they warned friends to come to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e. Friends met to con&s;ider of it, and &s;inding freedom to go, they met together there. They &s;ate down to wait upon the Lord in his power and Spirir and minded the
<PB N="26" REF="037441_0542_100D9193A48E2780">Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their Teacher and Saviour; but did not mind the prie&s;t. When the officers &s;aw that, they came to them to put them out of the &s;teeple-hou&s;e again; but the friends told them, it was not time for them to break up their meeting yet. Awhile after, when the prie&s;t had done, they came to the friends again, and would have had them go home to dinner; but the friends told them, they did not choo&s;e to go to dinner, they were feeding upon the bread of life. So there they &s;ate, waiting upon the Lord, and enjoying his power and pre&s;ence, till they found freedom in them&s;elves to depart. Thus the prie&s;t's people were of|fended, fir&s;t becau&s;e they could not get them to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e, and when there, they were offended, becau&s;e they could not get them out again.</P>
<P>From the meeting near Collumpton we went to Taun|ton, where we had a large meeting. The next day we came to a general meeting in Somer&s;et&s;hire, which was very large; and the Lord's everla&s;ting word of life and truth was largely declared. The people were refre&s;hed thereby, and &s;ettled upon Chri&s;t, their Rock and Foundation, and brought to &s;it under his teaching; and the meeting was peaceable. About the &s;econd hour of the night came a company of men, knocked at the door, and bid open it, or they would break it open; for they wanted a man that they came to &s;earch the hou&s;e for. I heard the noi&s;e, and got up, and &s;aw a man at the door with his &s;word by his &s;ide. When they had let him in, he came into the chamber where I was, and looked on me, and &s;aid, <Q>You are not the man I look|ed for;</Q> and went his way.</P>
<P>We came from thence to Street, and to William Beaton's at Puddimore, where we had a very large general meeting; wherein the Lord's everla&s;ting truth was declared, the peo|ple refre&s;hed, and all quiet. From thence we went to John Dandy's, where we had another large and very precious meet|ing; and then pa&s;&s;ed to Bri&s;tol, where we had good &s;ervice for the Lord, and all quiet. Here we met with Margaret Fell and her daughters again. After &s;ome time we went to Slattenford in Wilt&s;hire, where was a very large meeting in a great barn. Good &s;ervice we had there; for the truth, as it is in Je&s;us, was publi&s;hed among&s;t them, and many were gathered by it into the name of the Lord.</P>
<P>After this I pa&s;&s;ed into Glouce&s;ter&s;hire and Hereford&s;hire, having large meetings in each. In Hereford I had a meet|ing in the inn; after which, and I was gone, the magi&s;|trates
<PB N="27" REF="037441_0543_100D919550D82DF8">hearing of it, came to &s;earch the inn for me, and were vexed they had mi&s;&s;ed me. But the Lord &s;o ordered it, that I e&s;caped their hands, and friends were e&s;tabli&s;hed up|on Chri&s;t, their Foundation, the Rock of Ages.</P>
<P>Then I went into Radnor&s;hire, in Wales, where I had &s;everal precious meetings. The Lord's name and &s;tandard was &s;et up, many were gathered to it, and &s;ettled under the teaching of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, their Saviour, who bought them.</P>
<P>After I was clear of Wales, I came to a market-town be|twixt England and Wales, where was a great fair that day; and &s;everal friends being at the fair, we went to an inn, where they came to us. After a fine opportunity with friends we parted and went our way. The officers of the town took notice it &s;eems, of our being there, and of friends gathering to us. They began al&s;o to get together to con|&s;ult how to en&s;nare us, though it was the fair-time; but be|fore they could do any thing we were gone, and &s;o e&s;caped them.</P>
<P>From thence we came into Shrop&s;hire, where we had a large and precious meeting. After many meetings in tho&s;e parts, we came into Warwick&s;hire, vi&s;ited friends there, and &s;o into Derby&s;hire and Stafford&s;hire, vi&s;iting meetings as we went. At White-haugh we had a large ble&s;&s;ed meet|ing, and quiet; after which we took hor&s;e, and rode about twenty miles that night to captain Lingard's. We heard afterwards, that when we were gone, the officers came to have &s;eized us, and were much di&s;turbed they mi&s;&s;ed us; but the Lord di&s;appointed them, and friends were joyful in the Lord that we e&s;caped them.</P>
<P>At captain Lingard's we had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting, the Lord's pre&s;ence being wonderfully among&s;t us. After which we pa&s;&s;ed thro' the Peak-country in Derby&s;hire, and went to Synderhill-green, where we had a large meeting. Here John Whitehead and &s;everal friends came to me. Then I pa&s;&s;ed through the country, vi&s;iting friends, till I came to the farther end of Holderne&s;s, and by Scarborough, Whit|by, and Malton, to York, having many meetings in the way, and the Lord's everla&s;ting power was over all.</P>
<P>We went from york to Boroughbridge, where I had a glorious meeting. Thence we pa&s;&s;ed into the Bi&s;hoprick to one Richmond's, where was a general meeting; and the Lord's power was over all, though people were exceed|ing rude about this time. After the meeting we went to Henry Draper's, where we &s;taid all night. Next morning
<PB N="28" REF="037441_0544_100D919851C1C6C0">a friend came as I was pa&s;&s;ing away, and told me, <Q>If the prie&s;ts and ju&s;tices could light on me, they would de&s;troy me.</Q></P>
<P>Being clear of the Bi&s;hoprick, I went over Stainmore into York&s;hire, and to Sedberg; where having vi&s;ited friends, I went into We&s;tmoreland, vi&s;iting friends there al&s;o. From thence I pa&s;&s;ed into Lanca&s;hire, and came to Swarthmore, where I &s;taid but a little while before I went over the Sands to Arn&s;ide; where I had a general meeting. After it was ended &s;ome men came to have broken it up, but under|&s;tanding before they got thither the meeting was over, they turned back. I went to Robert Widders's, and from thence to Underbarrow, where I had a glorious meeting; and the Lord's power was &s;et over all. From thence I pa&s;&s;ed to Grayrigg, vi&s;ited friends, and then to Ann Audland's, where they would have had me to have &s;tay'd their meeting the next day; but I felt a &s;top in my Spirit. It was upon me to go to John Blaykling's, in Sedberg, to be at the meeting there; which is large, and a precious people there is. We had a very good meeting the next day; but the con&s;tables went to Ann Audland's meeting to look for me. Thus by the good hand and di&s;po&s;ing providence of the Lord I e&s;caped their &s;nare.</P>
<P>I went from John Blaykling's with Leonard Fell to Strickland-head, where on, fir&s;t-day we had a very precious meeting on the common. That night we &s;taid among&s;t our friends there, and the next day pa&s;&s;ed into Northumberland. After the ju&s;tices heard of this meeting, they made &s;earch for me; but by the good hand of the Lord I e&s;caped them, though there were &s;ome very wicked ju&s;tices. We went to Hugh Hutchin&s;on's, in Northumberland, a friend in the mini&s;try, from whence we vi&s;ted friends thereabouts; and then to Derwent-water, where we had a very glorious meet|ing. There came an ancient woman, and told me, her hu&s;band remembered his love to me; &s;he &s;aid I might call him to mind by this token, that I u&s;ed to call him, <Q>The tall white old man.</Q> She &s;aid, he was &s;ix &s;core and two years old, and that he would have come to the meeting, but that his hor&s;es were all employed upon &s;ome urgent occa|&s;ion. I heard he lived &s;ome years after.</P>
<P>When I had vi&s;ited friends in tho&s;e parts, and they were &s;ettled upon Chri&s;t, their Foundation, I pa&s;&s;ed through Northumberland, and came to old Thomas Bewley's, in Cumberland. Friends came about me and a&s;ked, <Q>Would
<PB N="29" REF="037441_0545_100D919A4923EF70">I come there to go into pri&s;on?</Q> For there was great per|&s;ecution in that country at that time; yet I had a general meeting at Thomas Bewley's, which was large and pre|cious; and the Lord's power was over all.</P>
<P>One Mu&s;grave was at that time deputy-governor of Car|li&s;le, and I pa&s;&s;ing along that country, came to a man's hou&s;e that had been convinced, who&s;e name was Fletcher; and he told me, <Q>If Mu&s;grave knew I was there, he would be &s;ure to &s;end me to pri&s;on, he was &s;uch a &s;evere man.</Q> But I &s;taid not, only called on the way to &s;ee this man, then went to William Pear&s;on's, near Wigton, where this meeting was, which was very large and precious. Some friends were then pri&s;oners at Carli&s;le, whom I vi&s;ited by a letter, which Leonard Fell carried. From William Pear|&s;on's I vi&s;ited friends till I came to Pard&s;ey-crag; where we had a general meeting, which was large, quiet, and peacea|ble, and the glorious, powerful pre&s;ence of the everla&s;ting God was with us.</P>
<P>So eager were the magi&s;trates about this time to &s;tir up per&s;ecution in tho&s;e parts, that &s;ome offered five &s;hillings, &s;ome a noble a day, to any that could apprehend the &s;peakers among&s;t Quakers; but it being now the time of the quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions in that county, the men who were &s;o hired were gone to the &s;e&s;&s;ions to get their w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ges, &s;o all our meetings were at that time quiet.</P>
<P>From Pard&s;ey-crag we went into We&s;tomoreland, calling in the way upon Hugh Tickell, near Ke&s;wick, and upon Thomas Laythes, where friends came to vi&s;it us; and we had a fine opportunity to be refre&s;hed together. We went that night to Francis Ben&s;on's, in We&s;tmoreland, near ju&s;|tice Fleming's. This ju&s;tice was at that time in a great rage again&s;t friends, and me in particular; in&s;omuch that in the open &s;e&s;&s;ions at Kendal, ju&s;t before, he had bid <Q>Five pounds to any man that &s;hould take me,</Q> as Francis Ben|&s;on told me. And it &s;eems, as I went to this friend's hou&s;e, I met one man coming from the &s;e&s;&s;ions that had this five pounds offered him to take me, and he knew me; for as I pa&s;&s;ed by him, he &s;aid to his companion, <Q>That is George Fox:</Q> yet he had not power to touch me; for the Lord pre&s;erved me over them all. The ju&s;tices being &s;o eager to have me, and I being &s;o often nigh them and you they mi&s;&s;ing me, it tormented them the more.</P>
<P>I went from thence to James Taylor's at Cartmel, in Lan|ca&s;hire,
<PB N="30" REF="037441_0546_100D919BD96B56E8">where I &s;taid fir&s;t-day, and had a precious meeting. After which I came over the Sands to Swarthmore.</P>
<P>There they told me coloned Kirby had &s;ent his lieutenant, who had &s;earched trunks and che&s;ts for me. That night as I was in bed, I was moved of the Lord to go next day to Kirby-hall, which was colonel Kirby's hou&s;e about five miles off, to &s;peak with him. When I came thither, I found the Flemings, and &s;everal others of the gentry (&s;o called) of the country, who were come to take their leave of colonel Kirby, he being then to go up to London to the parliament. I was had into the parlour among&s;t them; but colonel Kirby was not then within, being gone out a little way. They &s;aid little to me, nor I much to them. But after a little while colonel Kirby came in, and I told him, <Q>I came to vi&s;it him, under&s;tanding he was de&s;irous to &s;ee me, to know what he had to &s;ay to me, and whe|ther he had any thing again&s;t me?</Q> He &s;aid before all the company, <Q>As he was a gentleman, he had nothing again&s;t me. But,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>mi&s;tre&s;s Fell mu&s;t not keep great meetings at her hou&s;e, for they met contrary to the act.</Q> I told him, <Q>That act did not take hold on us, but on &s;uch as <Q>met to plot and contrive, and to rai&s;e in&s;urrections again&s;t the king;</Q> whereas we we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no &s;uch people: for he knew they that met at Margaret Fell's were his neigh|bours, and a peaceable people.</Q> After many words had pa&s;&s;ed, he &s;hook me by the hand, and &s;aid again, <Q>He had nothing again&s;t me;</Q> and others of them &s;aid, <Q>I was a de&s;erving man.</Q> So we parted, and I returned to Swarth|more.</P>
<P>Shortly after, when colonel Kirby was gone to London, there was a private meeting of the ju&s;tices and deputy-lieu|tenants at Houlker-hall, where ju&s;tice Pre&s;ton lived; where they granted a warrant to apprehend me. I heard over night both of their meeting and of the warrant, and could have gone out of their reach if I would; for I had not ap|pointed any meeting at that time, and I had cleared my&s;elf of the north, and the Lord's power was over all. But I con&s;idered, there being a noi&s;e of a plot in the north, if I &s;hould go away they might fall upon friends; but if I gave my&s;elf up to be taken, it might prevent them, and friends &s;hould e&s;cape the better; &s;o I gave my&s;elf up to be taken, and prepared again&s;t they came. Next day an officer came with his &s;word and pi&s;tols to take me. I told him, <Q>I knew his errand before, and had given my&s;elf to be taken;
<PB N="31" REF="037441_0547_100D919DC8F3BF80">for if I would have e&s;caped their impri&s;onment, I could have been forty miles off before he came; but I was an innocent man, and &s;o mattered not what they could do to me.</Q> He a&s;ked me, <Q>How I heard of it, &s;eeing the order was made privately in a parlour?</Q> I &s;aid, it was no matter for that, it was &s;ufficient that I heard it. I a&s;ked him to let me &s;ee his order; whereupon he laid his hand on his &s;word, and &s;aid, <Q>I mu&s;t go with him before the lieutenants, to an&s;wer &s;uch que&s;tions as they &s;hould propound to me.</Q> I told him, it was but civil and rea&s;onable for him to let me &s;ee his order; but he would not. Then &s;aid I, I am ready. So I went along with him, and Margaret Fell ac|companied us to Houlker-hall. When we came thither, there was one Rawlin&s;on, a ju&s;tice, and one called Sir George Middleton, and many more that I did not know, be&s;ides old ju&s;tice Pre&s;ton who lived there. They brought Thomas Atkin&s;on, a friend, of Cartmel, as a witne&s;s again&s;t me, for &s;ome words which he had told to one Knipe, who had informed them; which words were, <Q>That I had writ|ten again&s;t the plotters, and had knocked them down.</Q> The&s;e words they could not make much of; for I told them I had heard of a plot and had written again&s;t it. Old Pre&s;ton a&s;ked me, 'Whether I had an hand in that &s;cript?' I a&s;ked him what he meant? He &s;aid, in the Battledore? I an&s;wered, Yes. Then he a&s;ked me, <Q>Whether I did un|der&s;tand languages?</Q> I &s;aid, Sufficient for my&s;elf; and <Q>that I knew no law that was tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed by it. I told them al&s;o, That to under&s;tand tho&s;e outward languages, was no matter of &s;alvation; for the many tongues began but at the confu&s;ion of Babel: and if I did under&s;tand any thing of them, I judged and knocked them down again for any matter of &s;alvation that was in them.</Q> Thereupon he turned away, and &s;aid, <Q>George Fox knocks down all the languages. Come,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>we will exa|mine you of higher matters.</Q></P>
<P>Then &s;aid George Middleton, <Q>You deny God, and the church, and the faith.</Q> I replied, <Q>Nay: I own God, and the true church, and the true faith. But what church do&s;t thou own, &s;aid I?</Q> (for I under&s;tood he was a Papi&s;t.) Then he turned again, and &s;aid, <Q>You are a rebel and a traitor.</Q> I a&s;ked him, Whom he &s;poke to? or whom did he call a rebel? He was &s;o full of envy, that for 02 awhile he could not &s;peak; but at la&s;t he &s;aid, <Q>He &s;poke it to me.</Q> With that I &s;truck my hand on the table, and
<PB N="32" REF="037441_0548_100D91A04CD2E1F8">told him, I had &s;uffered more than twenty &s;uch as he, or than any that were there; <Q>for I had been ca&s;t into Derby pri&s;on for &s;ix months together, and had &s;uffered much be|cau&s;e I would not take up arms again&s;t the king before Worce&s;ter fight. I had been &s;ent up pri&s;oner out of my own country by colonel Hacker to O. Cromwel, as a plot|ter to bring in K. Charles, in the year 1654; and I had nothing but love and good-will to the king, and de&s;ired the eternal good and welfare of him and all his &s;ubjects. "Did you ever hear the like?". &s;aid Middleton. Nay, &s;aid I, ye may hear it again, if ye will. For ye talk of the king, a company of you; but where were ye in Oliver's days? and what did ye do then for him? I have more love to the king for his eternal good and welfare than any of you have.</Q></P>
<P>Then they a&s;ked me, <Q>Whether I had heard of the plot? I &s;aid, Yes, I had heard of it.</Q> They a&s;ked me, <Q>How I had heard of it? and whom I knew in it?</Q> I told them, <Q>I had heard of it through the high-&s;heriff of York&s;hire, who told Dr. Hodg&s;on there was a plot in the north;" that was the way I heard of it; but I never heard of any &s;uch thing in the &s;outh, nor till I came into the north. And as for knowing any in the plot, I was as a child in that, for I knew none of them.</Q> Then they &s;aid, <Q>Why would you write again&s;t it, if you had not known &s;ome that were in it?</Q> I &s;aid, <Q>My rea&s;on was, becau&s;e you are &s;o for|ward to ma&s;h the innocent and guilty together; therefore I wrote again&s;t it to clear the truth from &s;uch things, and to &s;top all forward fooli&s;h &s;pirits from running into &s;uch things.</Q> I &s;ent copies of it into We&s;tmoreland, Cumber|land, <Q>Bi&s;hoprick, York&s;hire, and to you here. I &s;ent an|other copy of it to the king and his council, and it is like it may be in print by this time.</Q> One of them &s;aid, <Q>O! this man hath great power!</Q> I &s;aid, Yes, I had power to write again&s;t plotters. Then &s;aid one of them, <Q>You are again&s;t the laws of the land.</Q> I an&s;wered <Q>Nay; for I and my friends direct all people to the Spirit of God in them, to mortify the deeds of the fle&s;h. This brings them into well-doing, and from that which the magi&s;trates &s;word is again&s;t, which ea&s;es the magi&s;trates, who are for the pu|ni&s;hment of evil-doers. People being turned to the Spirit of God, which brings them to mortify the deeds of the fle&s;h, from under the occa&s;ion of the magi&s;trates &s;word. This mu&s;t needs be one with magi&s;tracy, and one with
<PB N="33" REF="037441_0549_100D91A2375E7810">the law, which was added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and is for the prai&s;e of them that do well. In this we e&s;tabli&s;h the law, are an ea&s;e to the magi&s;trates, and are not again&s;t but &s;tand for all good government.</Q></P>
<P>Then George Middleton cried, <Q>Bring the book, and put the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy to him.</Q> He being a Papi&s;t, I a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether he had taken the oath of &s;upremacy, who was a &s;wearer? As for us, we could not &s;wear at all, becau&s;e Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tle had forbidden it.</Q> Some of them would not have had the oath put to me, but have &s;et me at liberty. The re&s;t would not agree to it; for this was their la&s;t &s;nare, and they had no other way to get me into pri&s;on, as all other things had been cleared to them. This was like the Papi&s;ts &s;acrament of the altar, by which they en&s;nared the martyrs. So they tendered me the oath, which I could not take; whereupon they were about to make my mittimus to &s;end me to Lanca&s;ter gaol; but con&s;idering of it, they only engaged me to appear at the &s;e&s;&s;ions, and for that time di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me. I went back with Margaret Fell to Swarthmore, and &s;oon after colonel We&s;t came to &s;ee me, who was-at that time a ju&s;tice of peace. He told us, <Q>He acquainted &s;ome of the re&s;t of the ju&s;tices, that he would come and &s;ee Margaret Fell and me; but it may be,</Q> &s;aid he, '&s;ome of you will take offence at it.' I a&s;ked him, What he thought they would do with me at the &s;e&s;&s;ions? He &s;aid, <Q>They would tender the oath to me again.</Q></P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was at Swarthmore, William Kirby came into Swarthmore meeting, and brought the con&s;tables with him. I was &s;itting with friends in the meeting, and he &s;aid to me, 'How now, Mr. Fox! you have a fine company here.' 'Yes,' &s;aid I, 'we meet to wait upon the Lord.' So he began to take the names of friends, and tho&s;e that did not readily tell him their names, he committed to the con&s;tables hands, and &s;ent &s;ome to pri&s;on. The con&s;tables were un|willing to take them without a warrant, whereupon he threat|ened to &s;et them by the heels; but the con&s;table told him, <Q>He could keep them in his pre&s;ence, but after he was gone he could not keep them without a warrant.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ions coming on, I went to Lanca&s;ter, and ap|peared according to my engagement. There was upon the bench ju&s;tice Fleming, who had bid five pounds in We&s;t moreland to any man that would apprehend me; for he was a ju&s;tice both in We&s;tmoreland and Lanca&s;hire. There
<PB N="34" REF="037441_0550_100D91A3CC6ACD70">were al&s;o ju&s;tice Spencer, colonel We&s;t, and old ju&s;tice Rawlin&s;on, the lawyer, who gave the charge, and was very &s;harp again&s;t truth and friends; but the Lord's power &s;top|ped them. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was large, the concour&s;e of people great, and way being made for me, I came up to the bar, and &s;tood with my hat on, they looking earne&s;tly upon me and I upon them for a pretty &s;pace. Proclamation be|ing made <Q>for all to keep &s;ilence upon pain of impri&s;on|ment;</Q> and all being quiet, I &s;aid twice, <Q>Peace be among you.</Q> The chairman a&s;ked, If I knew where I was? I &s;aid, <Q>Yes, I do; but it may be, &s;aid I, my hat offends you. That's a low thing, that's not the honour that I give to magi&s;trates, for the true honour is from above; which, &s;aid I, I have received, and I hope it is not the hat which ye look upon to be the honour.</Q> The chairman &s;aid, 'They looked for the hat too,' and a&s;ked, <Q>Wherein I &s;hewed my re&s;pect to magi&s;trates, if I did not put off my hat?</Q> I replied, 'In coming when they called me.' Then they bid one, 'Take off my hat.' After which it was &s;ome time before they &s;poke to me, and I felt the pow|er of the Lord to ari&s;e. After &s;ome pau&s;e, old ju&s;tice Rawlin&s;on (the chairman) a&s;ked me, <Q>If I knew of the plot?</Q> I told him, <Q>I heard of it in York&s;hire by a friend, who had it from the high-&s;heriff.</Q> They a&s;ked me, 'Whether I had declared it to the magi&s;trates?' I &s;aid, <Q>I had &s;ent papers abroad again&s;t plots and plotters, and al&s;o to you, as &s;oon as I came into the country, to take all jealou&s;ies out of your minds concerning me and my friends; for it is our principle to declare again&s;t &s;uch things.</Q> They a&s;ked me, <Q>If I knew not of an act again&s;t meetings?</Q> I &s;aid, <Q>I knew there was an act that took hold of &s;uch as met to the terrifying of the king's &s;ubjects, were enemies to the king, and held dangerous principles; but I hoped they did not look upon us to be &s;uch men, for our meetings were not to terrify the king's &s;ubjects, neither are we enemies to him or any man.</Q> Then they tendered me the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy. I told them, <Q>I could not take any oath at all, becau&s;e Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tle had forbid it; and they had &s;ufficient ex|perience of &s;wearers, fir&s;t one way, then another; but I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">er taken any oath in my life.</Q> Rawlin&s;on a&s;ked me, 'Whether I held it was unlawful to &s;wear?' This que&s;tion he put on purpo&s;e to en&s;nare me; for by an act that was made; &s;uch were liable to bani&s;hment or a great
<PB N="35" REF="037441_0551_100D91A55E33BC38">fine, that &s;hould &s;ay, it was 'unlawful to &s;wear.' But I, &s;eeing the &s;nare, avoided it, and told him, <Q>That in the time of the law among&s;t the Jews, before Chri&s;t came, the law commanded them to &s;wear; but Chri&s;t, who doth fulfil the law in his go&s;pel-time, commands, <Q>not to &s;wear at all;</Q> and the apo&s;tle James forbids &s;wearing, even to them that were Jews, and who had the law of God.</Q> After much di&s;cour&s;e they called for the gaoler, and committed me to pri&s;on. I had the paper about me which I wrote as a te&s;timony again&s;t plots, which I de&s;ired they would read, or &s;uffer to be read in open court; but they would not. So being committed for refu&s;ing to &s;wear, <Q>I bid them and all the people take notice, that I &s;uffered for the doctrine of Chri&s;t, and for my obedience to his command.</Q> After|wards I under&s;tood the ju&s;tices did &s;ay, that they had pri|vate in&s;tructions from colonel Kirby to pro&s;ecute me, not|with&s;tanding his fair carriage and &s;eeming kindne&s;s to me before, when he declared before many of them. <Q>That he had nothing again&s;t me.</Q> Several other friends were com|mitted to pri&s;on, &s;ome for meeting to wor&s;hip God, and &s;ome for not &s;wearing; &s;o that the pri&s;on was very full. Many of them being poor men, without any thing to main|tain their families by but their labour, which now they were taken from, &s;everal of their wives went to the ju&s;tices who committed their hu&s;bands, and told them, <Q>If they kept their hu&s;bands in gaol for nothing but the truth of Chri&s;t and for good con&s;cience-&s;ake, they would bring their chil|dren to them to be maintained.</Q> A mighty power of the Lord ro&s;e in friends, and gave them great boldne&s;s, &s;o that they &s;poke much to the ju&s;tices. Friends al&s;o that were pri&s;oners wrote to the ju&s;tices, <Q>laying the weight of their &s;ufferings upon them, and &s;hewing them both their inju&s;tice and want of compa&s;&s;ion towards their poor neighbours, whom they knew to be hone&s;t, con&s;cientious, peaceable people, that in tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience could not take any oath; yet they &s;ent them to pri&s;on for refu&s;ing to take the oath of allegiance. Though &s;everal of tho&s;e impri&s;oned on that account were known to be men who had &s;erved the king in his wars, had hazarded their lives in the field in his cau&s;e, had &s;uffered great hard&s;hips, with the lo&s;s of much blood for him, and always &s;tood faithful to him from fir&s;t to la&s;t, yet never received pay for their &s;ervice; and to be thus requited for all their faithful &s;ervices and &s;ufferings by tho&s;e that pretended to be the king's friends,
<PB N="36" REF="037441_0552_100D91A7C3EC8058">was hard, unkind, and ungrateful dealing.</Q> At length the ju&s;tices, being continually attended with complaints of grievances, relea&s;ed &s;ome of the friends, but kept divers &s;till in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>There were four friends pri&s;oners for tithes, &s;ent to pri&s;on at the &s;uit of the counte&s;s of Derby, who had lain near two years and an half. One of the&s;e was Oliver Atherton, who being of a weakly con&s;titution was through long and hard impri&s;onment in a cold, raw, unwhole&s;ome place, brought &s;o low and weak in his body, that there appeared no hopes of his life unle&s;s he might be removed. Where|fore a letter was wrote on his behalf to the counte&s;s, and &s;ent by his &s;on Godfrey Atherton, wherein was laid before her <Q>the rea&s;ons why he and the re&s;t could not pay tithes; becau&s;e if they did, they &s;hould deny Chri&s;t come in the fle&s;h, who by his coming had put an end to the tithes, and to the prie&s;thood to which they had been given, and to the commandment by which they had been paid under the law. His weak condition of body was al&s;o laid before her, and the apparent likelihood of his death, if &s;he con|tinued to hold him there, that &s;he might be moved to pity and compa&s;&s;ion, and al&s;o warned not to draw the guilt of innocent blood upon her.</Q> When his &s;on went to her with his father's letter, a &s;ervant of hers abu&s;ed him, pluck|ed off his cap and threw it away, and put him out of the gate. Neverthele&s;s the letter was delivered into her own hand, but &s;he &s;hut out all pity and tenderne&s;s, and con|tinued him in pri&s;on till death. When his &s;on returned to his father in pri&s;on, and told him as he lay on his dying|bed, that the counte&s;s denied his liberty, he only &s;aid, <Q>She hath been the cau&s;e of &s;hedding much blood, but this will be the heavie&s;t blood that ever &s;he &s;pilt,</Q> and &s;oon after he died. Friends having his body delivered to them to bury, as they carried it from the pri&s;on to Orm&s;kirk, the pari&s;h wherein he had lived, they &s;tuck up papers upon the cro&s;&s;es at Gar&s;tang, Pre&s;ton, and other towns through which they pa&s;&s;ed, with this in&s;cription:</P>
<P><Q>This is Oliver Atherton, of Orm&s;kirk pari&s;h, per&s;e|cuted to death by the counte&s;s of Derby for good con|&s;cience-&s;ake towards God and Chri&s;t, becau&s;e he could not give her tithes, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Setting forth the rea&s;ons of his refu&s;ing to pay tithes, the
<PB N="37" REF="037441_0553_100D91A9B056FC18">length of his impri&s;onment, the hard&s;hips he underwent, her hard-heartedne&s;s towards him, and the manner of his death. After his death, Richard Cubban, another of her pri&s;oners for tithes, wrote a large letter to her, on behalf of him&s;elf and his fellow-pri&s;oners at her &s;uit, laying their innocency before her; <Q>and that it was not out of wilful|ne&s;s, &s;tubbornne&s;s, or covetou&s;ne&s;s, that they refu&s;ed to pay their tithes, but purely in good con&s;cience towards God and Chri&s;t; letting her know, if &s;he &s;hould be &s;uf|fered to keep them there till they every one died, as &s;he had done their fellow-&s;ufferer, Oliver Atherton, they could not yield to pay her. And therefore de&s;ired her to con|&s;ider their ca&s;e in a Chri&s;tian &s;pirit, and not bring their blood upon her&s;elf al&s;o.</Q> Yet &s;he would not &s;hew any pity or compa&s;&s;ion to them, who had now &s;uffered hard impri&s;onment about two years and an half under her. In|&s;tead thereof &s;he &s;ent to Gar&s;tang, and threatened to com|plain to the king and council, and bring them into trouble, for &s;uffering the paper concerning Oliver Atherton's death to be &s;tuck upon their cro&s;s. The rage &s;he expre&s;&s;ed made the people take the more notice of it, and &s;ome of them &s;aid, 'The Quakers had given her a bone to pick.' But &s;he, that regarded not the life of an innocent &s;ufferer for Chri&s;t, lived not long after her&s;elf; for that day three weeks that Oliver Atherton's body was carried through Orm&s;kirk to be buried, &s;he died; and her body was carried that day &s;even weeks through the &s;ame town to her burying-place. Thus the Lord pur&s;ued the hard-hearted per&s;ecutor. I was kept till the a&s;&s;ize, and judge Turner and judge Twi&s;|den coming that circuit, I was brought before judge Twi&s;|den, the 14th of the month called March, the latter end of the year 1663. When I was &s;et to the bar, I &s;aid, <Q>Peace be among&s;t you all.</Q> The judge looked upon me, and &s;aid, <Q>What! do you come into the court with your hat on! Upon which words, the gaoler taking it off, I &s;aid, The hat is not the honour that comes from God.</Q> Then &s;aid the judge to me, <Q>Will you take the oath of allegi|ance, George Fox?</Q> I &s;aid, <Q>I never took any oath in my life, nor any covenant or engagement.</Q> 'Well,' &s;aid he, 'Will you &s;wear or no?' I an&s;wered, <Q>I am a Chri&s;|tian, and Chri&s;t commands me "not to &s;wear;" &s;o does the apo&s;tle James; and whether I &s;hould obey God or man, do thou judge.</Q> I a&s;k your again, &s;aid he, <Q>Whether you will &s;wear or no?</Q> I an&s;wered again, <Q>I am neither
<PB N="38" REF="037441_0554_100D91AB9F225A28">Turk, Jew, nor Heathen, but a Chri&s;tian, and &s;hould th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w forth chri&s;tianity. I a&s;ked him, If he did not know that Chri&s;tians in the primitive times, under the ten per&s;ecu|tions, and &s;ome al&s;o of the martyrs in queen Mary's days, refu&s;ed &s;wearing, becau&s;e Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tle had for|bidden it? I told him al&s;o, they had experience enough, how many had fir&s;t &s;worn for the king and then again&s;t him. But as for me I had never taken an oath in my life, My allegiance did not lie in &s;wearing, but in truth and faithfulne&s;s; for I honour all men, much more the king. But Chri&s;t, who is the Great Prophet, the King of kings, the Saviour and Judge of the whole world, &s;aith, I mu&s;t "not &s;wear." Now, whether mu&s;t I obey Chri&s;t or thee? For it is tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience, and in obedience to the command of Chri&s;t, that I do not &s;wear: and we have the word of a king for tender con&s;ciences. Then I a&s;ked the judge, If he did own the king? "Yes," &s;aid he, <Q>I do own the king.</Q> Why then, &s;aid I, do&s;t thou not ob&s;erve his declaration from Breda, and his promi&s;es made &s;ince he came into England, <Q>That no man &s;hould be called in que&s;tion for matters of religion, &s;o long as they lived peaceably?</Q> If thou owne&s;t the king, &s;aid I, why do&s;t thou call me in que&s;tion, and put me upon taking an oath, which is a matter of religion; &s;eeing thou nor none el&s;e can charge me with unpeaceable living?</Q> Upon this he was moved, and looking angrily at me, &s;aid, <Q>Sir|rah, will you &s;wear?</Q> I told him, <Q>I was none of his Sirrahs, I was a Chri&s;tian; and for him, an old man, and a judge, to &s;it there and give nick-names to pri&s;oners, it did not become either his grey hairs or his office.</Q> 'Well,' &s;aid he, 'I am a Chri&s;tian too.' <Q>Then do Chri&s;tian works,</Q> &s;aid I. 'Sirrah!' &s;aid he, <Q>Thou thinke&s;t to frighten me with thy words.</Q> Then catching him&s;elf, and looking a&s;ide, he &s;aid, <Q>Hark! I am u&s;ing the word (Sirrah) again;</Q> &s;o checked him&s;elf. I &s;aid, <Q>I &s;poke to thee in love; for that language did not become thee, a judge. Thou oughte&s;t to in&s;truct a pri&s;oner in the law, if he were ignorant and out of the way.</Q> <Q>And I &s;peak in love to thee too,</Q> &s;aid he. 'But,' &s;aid I, 'Love gives no nick|names.' Then he rou&s;ed him&s;elf up, and &s;aid, <Q>I will not be afraid of thee, George Fox. Thou &s;peake&s;t &s;o loud, thy voice drowns mine and the court's; I mu&s;t call for three or four criers to drown thy voice: thou ha&s;t good lungs.</Q> 'I am a pri&s;oner here,' &s;aid I, <Q>for the Lord Je|&s;us

If I could take any oath at all, I &s;hould take this; for I do not deny &s;ome oaths only or on &s;ome occa&s;ions, but all oaths, according to Chri&s;t's doctrine, who hath commanded his, "Not to &s;wear at all." Now if thou or any of you, or any of your mini&s;ters or prie&s;ts here, will prove that ever Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tle, after they had forbid all &s;wearing, commanded Chri&s;tians to &s;wear, then I will &s;wear.</Q> I &s;aw &s;everal prie&s;ts there; but not one of them offered to &s;peak. Then &s;aid the judge, <Q>I am a &s;ervant to the king, and the king &s;ent me not to di&s;|pute with you, but to put the laws in execution; there|fore tender him the oath of allegiance.</Q> <Q>If thou love the king,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>why do&s;t thou break his word, and not keep his declarations and &s;peeches, wherein he promi&s;ed liberty to tender con&s;ciences? I am a man of a tender con&s;cience, and in obedience to Chri&s;t's command I can|not &s;wear.</Q> 'Then you will not &s;wear,' &s;aid the judge; 'Take him away, gaoler.' I &s;aid, <Q>It is for Chri&s;t's &s;ake that I cannot &s;wear, and for obedience to his command I &s;uffer; and &s;o the Lord forgive you all.</Q> So the gaoler took me away; but I felt the mighty power of the Lord was over them all.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth of the &s;ame month I was brought before judge Twi&s;den again, who was &s;omewhat offended at my hat; but it being the la&s;t morning of the a&s;&s;ize, before he was to go out of town, and not many people there, he made the le&s;s of it. He a&s;ked me, <Q>Whether I would tra|ver&s;e, &s;tand mute, or &s;ubmit.</Q> But he &s;poke &s;o fa&s;t, it was hard to know what he &s;aid.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>O ju&s;tice Fleming!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MERCY, compa&s;&s;ion, love, and kindne&s;s adorn and grace men and magi&s;trates. Oh! do&s;t thou not hear the cry of the widows, and the cry of the fatherle&s;s, who were made &s;o through per&s;ecution! Were they not driven like &s;heep, from con&s;table to con&s;table, as though they had been the greate&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors or malefactors in the land? Which grieved and tendered the hearts of many &s;o|ber people, to &s;ee how their innocent neighbours and countrymen, who were of a peaceable carriage, and hone&s;t in their lives and conver&s;ations among men, were u&s;ed and &s;erved! One more is dead, whom thou &s;ente&s;t to pri&s;on, having left five children fatherle&s;s and motherle&s;s. How can&s;t thou do otherwi&s;e than take care of tho&s;e fatherle&s;s infants, and al&s;o of the other's wife and family? Is it not thy place? Con&s;ider Job (c. xxix.) He was a father to the poor, he delivered the poor that cried, and the father|le&s;s that had none to help. He broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the &s;poil out of his teeth. But oh! mea&s;ure thy life and his, and take heed of the day of God's eternal judgment, which will come, and the &s;en|tence and decree from Chri&s;t, when every man mu&s;t give an account and receive a reward according to his deeds. Then it will be &s;aid, <Q>Oh! where are the months that are pa&s;t!</Q> Again, ju&s;tice Fleming, con&s;ider, when John Stubbs was brought before thee, having a wife and four &s;mall children, and little to live on but what they hone&s;tly got by their own diligence; as &s;oon as he appeared, thou cried out. "Put the oath to that man." And when he confe&s;&s;ed he was but a poor man, thou had&s;t no regard,
<PB N="41" REF="037441_0557_100D91B1D5B5C128">but ca&s;t away pity, not hearing what he would &s;ay. And now he is kept in pri&s;on, becau&s;e he could not &s;wear, and break the command of Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tle, it is to be hoped thou wilt take care of his family, that his children do not &s;tarve; and &s;ee that they do not want bread. Can this be allegiance to the king, to do that which Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tle &s;ay is evil, and brings into condemnation? Would not you have ca&s;t Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tle into pri|&s;on, who commanded "not to &s;wear," if they had been in your days? Con&s;ider al&s;o thy poor neighbour, Wil|liam Wil&s;on, who was known to all the pari&s;h and neigh|bours to be an indu&s;trious man, careful to maintain his wife and children; yet had little but what he got with his hands in diligence and travels to &s;upply him&s;elf. How &s;hould his wife maintain her children, when thou ha&s;t ca&s;t her hu&s;band into pri&s;on, and thereby made him incapable of working for them? Therefore it may be expected thou wilt have a care of his wife and children, and &s;ee they do not want; for how &s;hould they live, having no other way to be &s;u&s;tained but by the little that he got? Surely the noi&s;e of this is in the very markets, the death of thy two neighbours, the cry of the widows and fatherle&s;s is heard. All tho&s;e fatherle&s;s and widows are made &s;o for righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;ake. For might not John Stubbs and William Wil|&s;on have had their liberty &s;till, if they would have &s;worn, though they had been &s;uch as go after mountebanks and &s;tage-plays, or run a hunting? Oh! con&s;ider! for the Lord's mind is otherwi&s;e. He is tender, and the king hath declared his mind to be, that there &s;hould be no cru|elty inflicted upon his peaceable &s;ubjects. Be&s;ides, &s;everal poor hone&s;t people were fined, who had need to have &s;omething given them; and it had been more honourable to have given them &s;omething, than to fine them and &s;end them to pri&s;on, &s;ome of whom live upon the charity of others. What honour or grace can it be to thee to ca&s;t thy poor neighbours into pri&s;on, who are peaceable; &s;ee|ing thou knowe&s;t the&s;e people cannot do that which thou require&s;t of them, if it were to &s;ave their lives or all that they have? Becau&s;e in tenderne&s;s they cannot take any oath, thou make&s;t that a &s;nare to them. What thinke&s;t thou do the people &s;ay concerning this? "We know," &s;ay they, <Q>the Quakers principle that keep to Yea and Nay; but we &s;ee others &s;wear and for&s;wear.</Q> Many of you have &s;worn fir&s;t one way and then another. So we
<PB N="42" REF="037441_0558_100D91B3645FF360">leave it to the Spirit of God in thy con&s;cience, ju&s;tice Fleming, who wa&s;t &s;o eager for the taking of George Fox, and &s;o offended with them that had not taken him, and now ha&s;t fallen upon thy poor neighbours. But oh! where's thy pity for their poor, fatherle&s;s children, and motherle&s;s infants? Oh! take heed of Herod's hard-heart|edne&s;s, and ca&s;ting away all pity! E&s;au did &s;o, not Jacob, Here is al&s;o Thomas Walters, of Bolton, ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and the oath impo&s;ed on him through thee, and for deny|ing to &s;wear at all, in obedience to Chri&s;t's command, he is continued in pri&s;on, who hath five &s;mall children and his wife near down-lying. Surely, thou &s;houlde&s;t take care for them al&s;o, and &s;ee that his wife and &s;mall children do not want, who are as fatherle&s;s and &s;he as a widow through thee. Do&s;t thou not hear in thy ears the cry of the fatherle&s;s, the cry of the widows, and the blood of the innocent &s;peak, who through thee have been per&s;ecuted to pri&s;on, and are now dead? Oh! heavy &s;entence at the day of judgment! How wilt thou an&s;wer, when thou and thy works come to be judged, when thou &s;halt be brought before the judgment-&s;eat of the Almighty, who in thy pro&s;|perity ha&s;t made widows and fatherle&s;s for righteou&s;ne&s;s|&s;ake, and for tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience towards God? The Lord knows and &s;ees it! O man! con&s;ider in thy life-time how thou ha&s;t &s;tained thy&s;elf with the blood of the inno|cent! When thou had'&s;t power and might'&s;t have done good among&s;t thy peaceable neighbours, thou would'&s;t not: but u&s;ed&s;t thy power not to a good intent, but con|trary to the Lord's mind and to the king's. The king's &s;avour, mercy, and clemency to &s;ober people and tender con&s;ciences hath been manife&s;ted by declarations and pro|clamations, which thou ha&s;t abu&s;ed and &s;lighted by per&s;e|cuting his peaceable &s;ubjects. At London and in other parts the Quakers meetings are peaceable; and if thou look but as far as York&s;hire, where the plot hath been, friends innocency hath cleared it&s;elf in the hearts of &s;ober ju&s;tices; and for you here to fall upon your peaceable neighbours and people, and to be rigorous and violent again&s;t them that are tender, godly, and righteous, it is no honour to you. How many drunkards, &s;wearers, and fighters, and &s;uch as are &s;ubject to vice, have you cau&s;ed to be brought before you to your courts? It were more honourable for you to look after &s;uch; for the law was not made for the righteous, but for &s;inners and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. Therefore
<PB N="43" REF="037441_0559_100D91B55453C028">con&s;ider, and be humbled for the&s;e things; for the Lord may do to thee as thou ha&s;t done to others; and thou do&s;t not know how &s;oon there may be a cry in thy own family, as the cry is among&s;t thy neighbours, of the fatherle&s;s and widows that are made &s;o through thee.

<P>It was not long after this ere Fleming's wife died, and left him thirteen or fourteen motherle&s;s children.</P>
<P>When I was pri&s;oner at Lanca&s;ter, there was pri&s;oner al|&s;o one major Wiggan, a Bapti&s;t-preacher. He boa&s;ted much before-hand what he would &s;ay at the a&s;&s;ize, if the oath &s;hould be put to him; and that he would refu&s;e to &s;wear. But when the a&s;&s;ize came, and the oath was ten|dered him, he de&s;ired time to con&s;ider of it; and that being granted him till the next a&s;&s;ize, he got leave to go to Lon|don before the a&s;&s;ize came again, and &s;taid at London till the plague broke forth, and there both he and his wife were cut off. He was a very wicked man, and the judgments of God came upon him; for he had publi&s;hed a very wicked book again&s;t friends, full of lies and bla&s;phemies; the occa|&s;ion of which was this. Whil&s;t he was in Lanca&s;ter ca&s;tle, he challenged friends to a di&s;pute. Whereupon I got leave of the ga <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er to go up to them. And entering into di&s;cour&s;e with him, he affirmed, <Q>That &s;ome men never had the Spi|rit of God, and that the true light, which enlighteneth eve|ry one that cometh into the world, is natural.</Q> For proof of his fir&s;t a&s;&s;ertion, he in&s;tanced Balaam, affirming, <Q>Ba|laam had not the Spirit of God,, I affirmed and proved, That Balaam had the Spirit of God, and that wicked men have the Spirit of God, el&s;e how could they quency it, vex it, grieve it, and re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, like the &s;tiff-necked
<PB N="44" REF="037441_0560_100D91B744E00048">Jews?</Q> To his &s;econd a&s;&s;ertion, I an&s;wered, <Q>That the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world, was the life in the world, and that was di|vine and eternal, and not natural. And he might as well &s;ay, the word was natural as that the life in the word was natural. And wicked men were enlightened by this light, el&s;e how could they hate it? It is expre&s;sly &s;aid, they did hate it; and the rea&s;on given why, was, <Q>becau&s;e their deeds were evil;</Q> and they would not come to it, becau&s;e it reproved them; and that mu&s;t needs be in them, which reproved them. Be&s;ides, that ligth could not be the &s;crip|tures of the New-Te&s;tament; for it was te&s;tified of before any part of the New-Te&s;tament was written; &s;o it mu&s;t be by the Divine Light, which is the life in Chri&s;t, the Word, before the &s;criptures were. And the grace of God, which brought &s;alvation, had appeared unto all men, and taught the &s;aints; but they that turned from it into wan|tonne&s;s, and walked de&s;pitefully again&s;t the Spirit of Grace, were the wicked. Again, the Spirit of Truth, the Holy Gho&s;t, the Comforter, which leads the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t into all truth, the &s;ame &s;hould reprove the world of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, of judgment, and of their unbelief. So the wicked world had it to reprove them, and the true di&s;ciples and learners of Chri&s;t, that believed in the light as Chri&s;t commands, had it to lead them. But the world that did not believe in the light, though they were lighted, but hated the light which they &s;hould have believed in, and loved the darkne&s;s rather than it, this world had a right|eou&s;ne&s;s and a judgment, which the Holy Gho&s;t reproved them for, as well as for their unbelief.</Q> Having proved, that the good and the bad were enlightened, that the Grace of God had appeared unto all, and that all had the Spirit of God, el&s;e they could not vex and grieve it, I told major Wiggan, The lea&s;t babe there might &s;ee him; and pre&s;ently &s;tood up one Richard Cubham, and proved him an anti|chri&s;t and a deceiver by &s;cripture. Then the gaoler had me away to my pri&s;on again. Afterwards Wiggan wrote a book of this di&s;pute, and put in abundance of abominable lies; which was &s;oon an&s;wered in print, and him&s;elf was not long after cut off, as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>This Wiggan was poor, and while he was pri&s;oner at Lanca&s;ter he &s;ent into the country, and got money gathered for relief of the poor people of God in pri&s;on; and many people gave freely, thinking it had been for us, when in|deed
<PB N="45" REF="037441_0561_100D91B9EAF74480">it was for him&s;elf. But when we heard of it, we laid it upon him, and wrote into the country, that friends might let the people know the truth of the matter, that it was not our manner to have collections made for us, and that tho&s;e collections were only for Wiggan and another, a drunken preacher of his &s;ociety: who was &s;o drunk, that once he lo&s;t his breeches.</P>
<P>After this it came upon me to write to the judges and other magi&s;trates concerning their <Q>giving evil words and nick-names to &s;uch as were brought before them.</Q> Which was after this manner.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>To all judges or other officers what&s;oever in the whole world, who profe&s;s your&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians.<LB>
Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEREIN and by reading the &s;criptures, ye may &s;ee both your own words and behaviour, and the words and practice of both Jews and Heathens, and of the King of kings, the great Lawgiver and Judge of the whole World. Fir&s;t, concerning the words and carriage of the Jews, when &s;ome worthy of death were brought before the rulers among&s;t them. When Achan had taken the Ba|byloni&s;h garment, the two hundred &s;hekels of &s;ilver, and the wedge of gold of fifty &s;hekels weight, and Jo&s;hua, who was then judge of I&s;rael, had by the lot di&s;covered him, he did not call him, Sirrah, nor you Ra&s;cal, Knave, Rogue, as &s;ome, called Chri&s;tian magi&s;trates, are too apt to do. But Jo&s;hua &s;aid unto Achan, "My &s;on." Mark his clean language, &s;avoury expre&s;&s;ion, and gracious words. "My &s;on," &s;aid he, <Q>give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of I&s;rael, and make confe&s;&s;ion unto him, and tell me now what thou ha&s;t done, hide it not from me.</Q> Then Achan confe&s;&s;ed, that he had &s;inned again&s;t the Lord God of I&s;rael, and thus and thus he had done. Then Jo&s;hua, the judge, &s;aid, <Q>Why ha&s;t thou troubled I&s;rael? The Lord &s;hall trouble thee this day; and they &s;toned him and his with &s;tones, and burned his goods with fire.</Q> But there was no un&s;avoury word given him that we read of, though he was worthy of death, Jo&s;h. vii.</P>
<P>So when the man, that gathered &s;ticks upon the &s;ab|bath-day, was taken and brought before Mo&s;es, the judge of I&s;rael, and put in ward till the mind of the Lord
<PB N="46" REF="037441_0562_100D91BB7A9CBED8">was known concerning him, we read not of any reviling language given him; but the Lord &s;aid to Mo&s;es, and Mo&s;es to the people, <Q>The man &s;hall &s;urely be put to death,</Q> Numb. xv. 35.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e in the rebellion of Corah, Dathan and Abi|ram, when Mo&s;es called them to trial, he did not &s;irrah them nor mi&s;name them; but &s;aid to Corah and the re&s;t, "Hear, I pray you, ye &s;ons of Levi," Numb. xvi. 8. And when he gave the &s;entence again&s;t them, he &s;aid, <Q>If the&s;e men die the common death of all men,</Q> &amp;c. He did not &s;ay, If the&s;e Ra&s;cals or Knaves, as many that profe&s;s them&s;elves Chri&s;tians now do.</P>
<P>When Elihu &s;poke to Job, who was a judge, and to his friends, and &s;aid, <Q>Let me not, I pray you, accept of any man's per&s;on, neither let me give flattering titles unto man, for I know not to give flattering titles; in &s;o doing my Maker would &s;oon take me away,</Q> Job xxxii. Job did not &s;ay, "Sirrah, hold thy tongue;" nor gave him any un&s;avoury expre&s;&s;ion. The words of David, Solo|mon, and other kings and officers, &s;ee in the books of the Kings and Chronicles, the &s;avoury language they gave to them that were brought before them. Nay, though Shi|mei cur&s;ed David the king, yet neither did David then or afterward, nor Solomon when he cau&s;ed him to be put to death, give him any reproachful language, or &s;o much as call him Sirrah, 2 Sam. xvi. and 1 Kings ii.</P>
<P>Read the prophecies of I&s;aiah, Micah, Jeremiah, Eze|kiel, and the re&s;t of the prophets, who prophe&s;ied to dif|ferent people, and again&s;t rulers, kings, and magi&s;trates; yet where can it be found, that they had any bad language given them, as Sirrah or the like, by any ruler either of the Jews or Heathens? Nay, though Jeremiah was ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and into the dungeon, yet there was no &s;uch word as Sirrah or Knave given him, Jer. xxxvii.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting the words and carriage of the Heathens. When Abraham was before Abimelech, who was a king, he gave Abraham no un&s;avoury expre&s;&s;ions, Gen. xx. When I&s;aac came before Abimelech, he gave him no taunting language. Gen. xxvi. When Jo&s;eph was ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and that in Egypt, we do not read he had any railing language given him, Gen. xxxix. Neither did Pharaoh, when Mo&s;es and Aaron appeared before him, give them bad language, as Sirrah, Knave or the like.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="037441_0563_100D7F8E0050B040">
When Nebuchadnezzar &s;entenced the three children to the fiery furnace, there was no &s;uch language given them as Sirrah, Knave, Ra&s;cal; but they were called by the names they were known by, Dan. iii. When Daniel was brought before king Darius, and &s;entenced to be ca&s;t into the lion's den, he had no &s;uch ill names given him, as many give now, who call tho&s;e Heathen rulers, but them|&s;elves Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>If ye look into the New-Te&s;tament, in the parable of the wedding-&s;upper, the king that came to view his gue&s;ts did not &s;ay to him that was found without a wedding|garment, "Sirrah, how came&s;t thou in hither?" but, "Friend, how came&s;t thou in hither?" &amp;c. though he was to be bound hand and foot, and "ca&s;t into utter darkne&s;s," Matth. xxii. Nay, when Judas had betrayed his ma&s;ter, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Lord of Life, and &s;old him to the prie&s;ts, Chri&s;t did not call him Sirrah, when he came to appre|hend him, but Friend, Matth. xxvi. 50. Stephen, in his examination, &s;entence, and death had no &s;uch reproachful word given him, as Sirrah or Knave, Acts vi. &amp; vii. chap. When the apo&s;tles Peter and John were brought before the high-prie&s;t and rulers of the Jews, and commanded not to preach in the name of Je&s;us, Acts iv. they were not called Sirrahs or Knaves, nor had any &s;uch ill names given them. When Paul and Silas were ca&s;t into pri&s;on by the magi&s;trates, Acts xvi. they called them men, not Rogues, Sirrahs, nor Knaves. And when the magi&s;trates had done contrary to law they feared. So ye may &s;ee how &s;hort of this example many are that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tian rulers, who are not afraid to ca&s;t innocent peo|ple into pri&s;on, and give them ill names be&s;ides, below both Jews and Heathens.</P>
<P>When the uproar was at Ephe&s;us about Diana's &s;hrine, Demetrius, who bore great &s;way among the craft&s;men, did not call Paul Sirrah, but Paul, Acts xix. When Paul was brought pri&s;oner before the high-prie&s;t Ananias and the council of the Jews, and told them, <Q>He had lived in all good con&s;cience towards God until that day;</Q> though they, who profe&s;&s;ed the &s;criptures but lived out of the life of them, could not abide to hear of living in a good con&s;cience, as profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;criptures now, that live not in the life, cannot abide to hear of living in a good con&s;cience now-a-days; but Ananias cau&s;ed Paul to be "&s;mitten on the mouth;" yet he did not call him Knave
<PB N="48" REF="037441_0564_100D91BD69001030">nor Sirrah, Acts xxiii. The apo&s;tate Jews indeed, who, though they profe&s;&s;ed &s;cripture, were out of the life there|of, and had rejected Chri&s;t, in accu&s;ing Paul before the Roman magi&s;trates, did once call him a Pe&s;tilent Fellow, Acts xxiv. as the accu&s;ing profe&s;&s;ors, who live out of the life, &s;ometimes call us now. But neither Felix, Fe&s;tus, nor king Agrippa, in all their examinations, gave Paul any &s;uch words as Sirrah, Ra&s;cal, Knave, or the like, but heard him patiently. So Chri&s;tians may &s;ee through all the &s;criptures, when per&s;ons were brought before rulers, kings, or magi&s;trates, whether Jews or Heathens, they did not u&s;e to call them evil names, as Sirrah, Ra&s;cal, Knave, and the like. They had no &s;uch foul-mouth'd language in their courts. Nor did they u&s;e to &s;ay to them, <Q>Sirrah, put off your hat.</Q> Now, ye that profe&s;s chri&s;tianity, and &s;ay the "&s;cripture is your rule," may &s;ee that more corrupt words proceed out of your mouths than either out of the Jews or Heathens, if ye will try your practice by the &s;criptures; and doth not the apo&s;tle tell you, that no corrupt communication &s;hould proceed out of your mouths? and that your words &s;hould be gracious? I query, Where and whence ye that call your&s;elves Chri&s;ti|ans have got all the&s;e bad words and names, &s;eeing neither God nor Chri&s;t, the prophets, judges, kings, nor rulers ever gave any &s;uch names, &s;o far as appears by &s;cripture, either among&s;t Heathens, Jews, or Chri&s;tians?</P>

<P>Before the next affizes there was a quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions held at Lanca&s;ter by the ju&s;tices.

<P>A Te&s;timony from the people of God, whom the world calls Quakers, to all the magi&s;trates and officers of what &s;ort &s;oever, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t.</P>
<P>WE are peaceable, and &s;eek the peace, good, and welfare of all, as in our lives and peaceable carria|ges is manife&s;ted, and we de&s;ire the eternal good of all, and their &s;ouls everla&s;ting peace.

We are heirs of the go&s;pel of peace, which is the power of God; we are heirs of Chri&s;t, who have inherited him and his everla&s;ting kingdom, and do po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of an endle&s;s life.

The blood of bulls, lambs, rams, and other offerings, and that prie&s;t|hood which offered them, together with other things in the law, were types of Chri&s;t, the one offering, and of his blood, who is the everla&s;ting prie&s;t and covenant, our life, and way to God, the great prophet and &s;hepherd, the head of his church, and the great bi&s;hop of our &s;ouls, whom we witne&s;s come; he doth over&s;ee and keep his flock. For in Adam, in the fall, we know the &s;triving, quarrel|ling, unpeaceable &s;pirits are at enmity one with another, and not in peace; but in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the &s;econd Adam, that never fell, is peace, re&s;t, and life. The doctrine of Chri&s;t, who never &s;inned, is to "love one another," and tho&s;e who are in this doctrine hurt no man, in which we are, in Chri&s;t, who is our life. Therefore it is well for you to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the precious and the vile, be|tween them that fear God and &s;erve him and them that do not, and to put a difference between the innocent and the 'guilty, between him that is holy and pure and the ungod|ly and prophane; for they that do not &s;o, bring troubles, burdens, and &s;orrows upon them&s;elves. This we write in love to your &s;ouls, that ye may con&s;ider the&s;e things; for tho&s;e that hate enemies, and one another, we cannot &s;ay they are of God, nor in Chri&s;t's doctrine, but are oppo&s;ers of it. And &s;uch as wre&s;tle with fle&s;h and blood, with carnal weapons, are gone into the fle&s;h out of the Spirit. They are not in our fellow&s;hip in the Spirit, in which is the bond of peace, neither are they of us, nor have we unity with them in their fle&s;hly &s;tate, and with their carnal weapons. For our unity and fellow&s;hip &s;tands in the go&s;pel, which is the power of God, before the devil was, the liar, the murderer, the man-&s;layer, and the envious. Chri&s;t's mind and his doctrine being to &s;ave men's lives, we who are of Chri&s;t's mind are out of and above the&s;e things.

<P>Being pri&s;oner in Lanca&s;ter ca&s;tle, a deep &s;en&s;e came up|on me of a day of &s;ore trial and exerci&s;e that was come and coming upon all who had been high in profe&s;&s;ion of religion; and I was moved to give forth the following paper as a warning to &s;uch:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>NOW is the day that every one's faith and love to God and Chri&s;t will be tried; who are redeemed out of the earth, and who are in the earth will be mani|fe&s;ted; who is the ma&s;ter they &s;erve, and whether they will run to the mountains to cover them.

<P>In the &s;ixth month the a&s;&s;izes were held again at Lanca&s;ter, and the &s;ame judges, Twi&s;den and Turner, came that cir|cuit again; but judge Turner then &s;ate on the crown-bench, &s;o I was brought before him. Before I was called to the bar, I was put among murderers and felons for about the &s;pace of two hours, the people, the ju&s;tices, and the judge al&s;o gazing upon me. After they had tried &s;everal others, they called me to the bar, and impanelled a jury. Then the judge a&s;ked the ju&s;tices, <Q>Whether they had tendered me the oath at the &s;e&s;&s;ions?</Q> They &s;aid, 'They had.' Then he bid, <Q>Give them the book, that they might &s;wear they had tendered me the oath at the &s;e&s;&s;ions.</Q> They &s;aid, 'They had.' Then the bid, <Q>Give them the book, that they might &s;wear they had tendered me the oath according to the indictment.</Q> Some of the ju&s;tices refu&s;ed to be &s;worn; but the judge &s;aid, he would have it done to take away all occa&s;ion of exception. When the jury were &s;worn, and the ju&s;tices had &s;worn <Q>they had tendered the oath ac|cording to the indictment,</Q> the judge a&s;ked me, <Q>Whether I had not refu&s;ed the oath at the la&s;t a&s;&s;izes?</Q> I &s;aid, <Q>I never took an oath in my life, and Chri&s;t, the Saviour and Judge of the World, &s;aid, "Swear not at all." The judge &s;eemed not to take notice of my an&s;wer; but a&s;ked me, Whether or no I had not refu&s;ed to take the oath at the
<PB N="53" REF="037441_0569_100D91C7120C6838">la&s;t a&s;&s;ize?</Q> I &s;aid, <Q>The words that I then &s;poke to them were, that if they could prove, either judge, ju&s;tices, prie&s;t, or teacher, that after Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tle had forbidden &s;wearing, they commanded that Chri&s;tians &s;hould &s;wear, I would &s;wear.</Q> The judge &s;aid, <Q>He was not at that time to di&s;pute whether it was lawful to &s;wear, but to inquire whether I had refu&s;ed to take the oath or no.</Q> I told him, <Q>Tho&s;e things mentioned in the oath, as plotting again&s;t the king, and owning the pope's or any other fo|reign power, I utterly deny.</Q> 'Well,' &s;aid he, <Q>you &s;ay well in that; but did you deny to take the oath? What &s;ay you? What would&s;t thou have me to &s;ay?</Q> &s;aid I, 'for I have told thee before what I did &s;ay.' Then he a&s;ked me, <Q>If I would have the&s;e men to &s;wear that I had taken the oath?</Q> I a&s;ked him, <Q>If he would have tho&s;e men to &s;wear that I had refu&s;ed the oath?</Q> At which the court bur&s;t out into laughter. I was grieved to &s;ee &s;o much lightne&s;s in a court, where &s;uch &s;olemn matters are handled, and thereupon a&s;ked him, <Q>If this court was a play-hou&s;e? Where is gravity and &s;obriety,</Q> &s;aid I; <Q>for this behaviour doth not become you.</Q> Then the clerk read the indict|ment, and I told the judge, <Q>I had &s;omething to &s;peak to it; for I had informed my&s;elf of the errors that were in it.</Q> He told me, <Q>He would hear me afterward any rea&s;ons that I could allege why he &s;hould not give judgment.</Q> Then I &s;poke to the jury, and told them, <Q>They could not bring me in guilty according to that indictment; for the indict|ment was wrong laid, and had many gro&s;s errors in it.</Q> <Q>The judge &s;aid, I mu&s;t not &s;peak to the jury, but he would &s;peak to them;</Q> and he told them, <Q>I had denied to take the oath at the la&s;t a&s;&s;izes, and,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I can tender the oath to any man now, and premunire him for not taking it; and,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>they mu&s;t bring me in guil|ty, &s;eeing I refu&s;ed to take the oath.</Q> 'Then,' &s;aid I, <Q>what do ye do with a form? Ye may throw away your form then.</Q> And I told the jury, <Q>It lay upon their con|&s;ciences, as they would an&s;wer it to the Lord God before his judgment-&s;eat.</Q> Then the judge &s;poke again to the jury, and I called to him to 'do me ju&s;tice.' The jury brought me in guilty. Whereupon I told them, <Q>That both the ju&s;tices and they had for&s;worn them&s;elves, and 'therefore they had &s;mall cau&s;e to laugh as they did a little before.</Q> Oh! the envy, rage, and malice, that appeared again&s;t me, and the lightne&s;s; but the Lord confounded
<PB N="54" REF="037441_0570_100D91C95CDA8150">them, and they were wonderfully &s;topped. So they &s;et me a&s;ide, and called up Margaret Fell, who had a great deal of good &s;ervice among&s;t them, and then the court broke up near the &s;econd hour.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we were brought again to have &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon us. Margaret Fell de&s;ired &s;entence might be deferred till the next morning. <Q>I de&s;ired nothing but law and ju&s;tice at his hands, for the thieves had mercy; only I reque&s;ted the judge to &s;end &s;ome to &s;ee my pri&s;on, which was &s;o bad they would put no creature they had in it; and I told him, that colonel Kirby, who was then on the bench, &s;aid, <Q>I &s;hould be locked up, and no fle&s;h alive &s;hould come to me.</Q> The judge &s;hook his head, and &s;aid, When the &s;entence was given, he would leave 'me to the favour of the gaoler.</Q> Mo&s;t of the gentry of the country were gathered together, expecting to hear the &s;en|tence; and the noi&s;e among&s;t the people was, <Q>That I &s;hould be tran&s;ported.</Q> But they were all cro&s;&s;ed at that time; for the &s;entence being deferred till next morning, I was had to pri&s;on again. Upon my complaining of the badne&s;s of my pri&s;on, &s;ome of the ju&s;tices, with colonel Kirby, went up to &s;ee it; but when they came, they dur&s;t hardly go in, the floor was &s;o bad and dangerous, and the place &s;o open to wind and rain. Some that came up &s;aid, 'Sure it was a Jakes-hou&s;e.' When colonel Kirby &s;aw it, and heard what others &s;aid of it, he excu&s;ed the matter as well as he could, &s;aying, <Q>I &s;hould be removed ere it was long to &s;ome more convenient place.</Q></P>
<P>Next day, towards the eleventh hour, we were called again to hear the &s;entence; and Margaret Fell being called fir&s;t to the bar, &s;he had coun&s;el to plead, who found many errors in her indictment; whereupon, after the judge had acknowledged them, &s;he was &s;et by. Then the judge a&s;k|ed, 'What they could &s;ay to mine?' I was not willing to let any man plead for me, but to &s;peak to it my&s;elf; and in|deed, though Margaret had &s;ome that pleaded for her, yet &s;he &s;poke as much her&s;elf as &s;he would. But before I came to the bar, I was moved in my &s;pirit to pray, <Q>That God would confound their wickedne&s;s and envy, &s;et his truth over all, and exalt his &s;eed.</Q> The Lord heard and an&s;wered, and did confound them in their proceedings again&s;t me. And though they had mo&s;t envy again&s;t me, yet the mo&s;t gro&s;s errors were found in my indictment.</P>
<P>I having put by others from pleading for me, the judge
<PB N="55" REF="037441_0571_100D91CAEC184CB0">a&s;ked me, <Q>What I had to &s;ay, why he &s;hould not pa&s;s &s;entence upon me?</Q> I told him, <Q>I was no lawyer; but I had much to &s;ay if he would but have patience to hear.</Q> At that he laughed, and others laughed al&s;o, and &s;aid, 'Come, what have you to &s;ay? He can &s;ay nothing.' 'Yes,' &s;aid I, <Q>I have much to &s;ay; have but the patience to hear me.</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether the oath was to be tendered to the king's &s;ubjects, or to the &s;ubjects of foreign princes?</Q> He &s;aid, 'To the &s;ubjects of this realm.' Then &s;aid I, <Q>Look into the indictment, ye may &s;ee that ye have left out the word Subject; &s;o not having named me in the in|dictment as a &s;ubject, ye cannot premunire me for not taking an oath.</Q> Then they looked over the &s;tatute and the indictment, and &s;aw it was as I &s;aid; and the judge confe&s;&s;ed it was an error. I told him, I had &s;omething 'el&s;e to &s;top his judgment,' and de&s;ired him to look what day the indictment &s;aid the oath was tendered to me at the &s;e&s;&s;ions there. They looked, and &s;aid, <Q>It was the eleventh day of January.</Q> <Q>What day of the week was the &s;e&s;&s;ions held on?</Q> &s;aid I. 'On a Tue&s;day,' &s;aid they. Then &s;aid I, <Q>Look your Almanacks, and &s;ee whether there was any &s;e&s;&s;ions held at Lanca&s;ter on the eleventh day of Ja|nuary, &s;o called?</Q> So they looked, and found that the eleventh day was the day called Monday, and that the &s;e&s;|&s;ions was on the day called Tue&s;day, which was the twelfth day of that month. 'Look now,' &s;aid I, <Q>ye have indicted me for refu&s;ing the oath in the quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions held at Lanca&s;ter on the eleventh day of January la&s;t, and the ju&s;tices have &s;worn that they tendered me the oath in open &s;e&s;&s;ions here that day, and the jury upon their oaths have found me guilty thereupon; and yet ye &s;ee there was no &s;e&s;&s;ion held in Lanca&s;ter that day.</Q> Then the judge, to cover the matter, a&s;ked, <Q>Whether the &s;e&s;&s;ions did not begin on the eleventh day?</Q> But &s;ome in the court an|&s;wered, <Q>No; the &s;e&s;&s;ion held but one day, and that was the twelfth.</Q> Then the judge &s;aid, <Q>This was a great mi&s;take and an error.</Q> Some of the ju&s;tices were in a great rage at this, &s;tamped, and &s;aid, <Q>Who hath done this? Somebody hath done this on purpo&s;e;</Q> and a great heat was among&s;t them. Then, &s;aid I, <Q>Are not the ju&s;|tices here, that have &s;worn to this indictment, for&s;worn men in the face of the country? But this is not all,</Q> &s;aid I <Q>I have more yet to offer why &s;entence &s;hould not be
<PB N="56" REF="037441_0572_100D91CCC23C8280">given again&s;t me.</Q> I a&s;ked, <Q>In what year of the king the la&s;t a&s;&s;ize here was holden, which was in the month called March la&s;t?</Q> The judge &s;aid, <Q>It was in the &s;ix|teenth year of the king.</Q> 'But,' &s;aid I, <Q>the indictment &s;ays, it was in the fifteenth year.</Q> They looked, and found it &s;o. This al&s;o was acknowledged to be another error. Then they were all in a fret again, and could not tell what to &s;ay; for the judge had &s;worn the officers of the court, that the oath was tendered to me at the a&s;&s;ize mentioned in the indictment. 'Now,' &s;aid I, <Q>is not the court here for&s;worn al&s;o, who have &s;worn that the oath was tender|ed to me at the a&s;&s;ize holden here in the fifteenth year of the king, when it was in his &s;ixteenth year, and &s;o they have &s;worn a year fal&s;e?</Q> The judge bid them look whe|ther Margaret Fell's indictment was &s;o or no. They look|ed, and found it was not &s;o. I told the judge, <Q>I had more yet to offer to &s;top &s;entence;</Q> and a&s;ked him. <Q>Whe|ther all the oath ought to be put into the indictment or no?</Q> 'Yes,' &s;aid he, 'it ought to be all put in.' 'Then,' &s;aid I, <Q>compare the indictment with the oath, and there thou maye&s;t &s;ee the&s;e words; viz. [or by any authority de|rived, or pretended to be derived from him or his &s;ee] left out of the indictment, which is a principal part of the oath; and in another place the words [heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors] are left out.</Q> The judge acknowledged the&s;e al&s;o to be great errors. 'But,' &s;aid I, 'I have &s;omething further to allege.' 'Nay,' &s;aid the judge, 'I have enough, you need &s;ay no more.' 'If,' &s;aid I, <Q>thou ha&s;t enough, I de&s;ire nothing but law and ju&s;tice at thy hands; for I don't look for mercy.</Q> <Q>You mu&s;t have ju&s;tice,</Q> &s;aid he, 'and you &s;hall have law.' Then I a&s;ked, <Q>Am I at liberty, and free from all that ever hath been done again&s;t me in this matter?</Q> 'Yes,' &s;aid the judge, <Q>you are free from all that hath been done again&s;t you. But then,</Q> &s;tarting up in a rage, he &s;aid, <Q>I can put the oath to any man here, and I will tender you the oath again.</Q> I told him, <Q>He had examples enough ye&s;terday of &s;wearing and fal&s;e-&s;wearing. both in the ju&s;ti|ces and in the jury; for I &s;aw before mine eyes that both ju&s;tices and jury had for&s;worn them&s;elves.</Q> The judge a&s;ked me, 'If I would take the oath?' I an&s;wered. Do me <Q>ju&s;tice for my fal&s;e impri&s;onment all this while; for what have I been impri&s;oned &s;o long for? I told him, I ought to be &s;et at liberty.</Q> 'You are at liberty,' &s;aid he, <Q>but I will put the oath to you again.</Q> Then I turned about,
<PB N="57" REF="037441_0573_100D91CF75D3A5D8">and &s;aid, <Q>All people, take notice this is a &s;nare, for I ought to be &s;et free from the gaoler and from this court.</Q> But the judge cried, 'Give him the book,' and the &s;heriff and the ju&s;tices cried, 'Give him the book.' Then the power of darkne&s;s ro&s;e up in them, like a mountain, and a clerk lifted up a book to me. I &s;tood &s;till, and &s;aid, <Q>If it be a Bible, give it me into my hand.</Q> 'Yes, yes,' &s;aid the judge and ju&s;tices, 'give it him into his hand.' <Q>So I took it, and looked into it, and &s;aid, I &s;ee it is a Bible, I am glad of it.</Q> He had cau&s;ed the jury to be called, and they &s;tood by; for after they had brought in their former verdict, he would not di&s;mi&s;s them though they de&s;ired it, but told them, <Q>He could not di&s;mi&s;s them yet, he &s;hould have bu|&s;ine&s;s for them; therefore they mu&s;t attend, and be ready when they were called.</Q> When he &s;aid &s;o, I felt his intent, that if I was freed, he would come on again. So I looked him in the face, and the witne&s;s of God &s;tarted up in him, and made him blu&s;h when he looked at me again; for he &s;aw that I di&s;covered him. Neverthele&s;s hardening him&s;elf, he cau&s;ed the oath to be read to me, the jury &s;tanding by. When it was read, he a&s;ked me, <Q>Whether I would take the oath or no?</Q> Then &s;aid I, <Q>Ye have given me a book here to ki&s;s, and to &s;wear on; and this book which ye have given me to ki&s;s, &s;ays, "Ki&s;s the Son;" and the Son &s;ays in this book, "Swear not at all;" and &s;o &s;ays al&s;o the apo&s;tle James. I &s;ay as the book &s;ays, yet ye impri&s;on me. How chance ye do not impri&s;on the book for &s;aying &s;o? How comes it that the book is at liberty among you, which bids me not to &s;wear, and yet ye impri&s;on me for do|ing as the book bids me?</Q> I was &s;peaking this to them, and held up the Bible open in my hand, to &s;hew them the place where Chri&s;t forbad &s;wearing, they plucked the book out of my hand, and the judge &s;aid, <Q>Nay, but we will im|pri&s;on George Fox.</Q> Yet this got abroad over all the country as a by-word, <Q>That they gave me a book to &s;wear on that commanded the "not to &s;wear at all;" and that the Bible was at liberty, and I in pri&s;on for doing as the Bible &s;aid.</Q> When the judge &s;till urged me to &s;wear, I told him, <Q>I never took oath, covenant, nor engagement in my life; but my yea, or nay was more binding to me than an oath was to many others; for had they not had ex|perience how little men regarded an oath? and how they had &s;worn one way and then another? and how the ju&s;tices and court had for&s;worn them&s;elves now? I told him, I.
<PB N="58" REF="037441_0574_100D91D169208C98">was a man of a tender con&s;cience, and if they had any &s;en&s;e of a tender con&s;cience, they would con&s;ider, that it was in obedience to Chri&s;t's command that I could not &s;wear. But,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>if any of you can convince me, that, after Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tle had commanded not to &s;wear, they altered that command, and commanded Chri&s;tians to &s;wear, ye &s;hall &s;ee I will &s;wear.</Q> There being many prie&s;ts by, I &s;aid, <Q>If ye cannot do it, let your prie&s;ts &s;tand up and do it.</Q> But not one of the prie&s;ts made an&s;wer. 'Oh!' &s;aid the judge, 'all the world cannot convince you.' 'No,' &s;aid I, <Q>how is it like the world &s;hould convince me? "The whole world lies in wickedne&s;s." Bring out your &s;piritual men, as ye call them, to convince me.</Q> Then both the &s;heriff and the judge &s;aid, <Q>The angels &s;wore in the Revelations.</Q> I replied, <Q>When God bringeth his fir&s;t-be|gotten Son into the world, he &s;aith, "Let all the angels "of God wor&s;hip him;" and he &s;aith, "Swear not at all." Nay,</Q> &s;aid the judge, 'I will not di&s;pute.' Then I &s;poke to the jury, telling them, <Q>It was for Chri&s;t's &s;ake that I could not &s;wear, and therefore I warned them not to act contrary to that of God in their con&s;ciences; for before his judgment &s;eat they mu&s;t all be brought.</Q> I told them, <Q>As for plots, and per&s;ecution for religion and popery, I deny them in my heart; for I am a Chri&s;tian, and &s;hall &s;hew forth Chri&s;tianity among&s;t you this day. It is for Chri&s;t's doctrine I &s;tand.</Q> More words I had both with the judge and jury before the gaoler took me away.</P>
<P>In the afternoon I was brought up again, and put among the thieves a pretty while, where I &s;tood with my hat on till the gaoler took it off. Then the jury having found this new indictment again&s;t me 'for not taking the oath,' I was called to the bar, and the judge a&s;ked me, <Q>What I would &s;ay for my&s;elf?</Q> I bid them read the indictment, for I would not an&s;wer to that which I did not hear. The clerk read it, and as he read the judge &s;aid, <Q>Take heed it be not fal&s;e again;</Q> but he read it in &s;uch a manner, that I could hardly under&s;tand what he read. When he had done, the judge a&s;ked me, 'What I &s;aid to the indictment?' I told him, <Q>At once hearing &s;o large a writing read, and that at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that I could not di&s;tinctly hear all the parts of it, I could not well tell what to &s;ay to it; but if he would let me have a copy of it, and give me time to con&s;ider of it, I &s;hould an&s;wer it.</Q> This put them to a little &s;tand; but after awhile the judge a&s;ked me, <Q>What time I would
<PB N="59" REF="037441_0575_100D91D2FA916498">have?</Q> I &s;aid, 'Till the next a&s;&s;ize.' 'But,' &s;aid he, <Q>what plea will ye now make? Are ye guilty, or not guilty?</Q> I &s;aid, <Q>I am not guilty at all of denying to &s;wear ob&s;tinately and wilfully; and as for tho&s;e things mentioned in the oath, as je&s;uitical plots and foreign powers, I utterly deny them in my heart. If I could take any oath I &s;hould take that; but I never took any oath in my life.</Q> The judge an&s;wer|ed, 'I &s;aid well; but,' &s;aid he, <Q>the king is &s;worn, the par|liament is &s;worn, I am &s;worn, and the ju&s;tices are &s;worn, and the law is pre&s;erved by oaths.</Q> I told him, <Q>They had &s;ufficient experience of men's &s;wearing, and he had &s;een how the ju&s;tices and jury had &s;worn wrong the other day; and if he had read in the book of martyrs how many of them had refu&s;ed to &s;wear, both in the time of the ten per&s;ecutions and in bi&s;hop Bonner's days, he might &s;ee, that to deny &s;wearing in obedience to Chri&s;t's command was no new thing.</Q> He &s;aid, 'He wi&s;hed the laws were otherwi&s;e.' I &s;aid, <Q>Our yea is yea, and our nay is nay; and if we tran&s;gre&s;s our yea or our nay, let us &s;uffer as they do, or &s;hould do, that &s;wear fal&s;ely.</Q> This, I told him, we had offered to the king, and the king &s;aid, 'It was rea&s;onable.'</P>
<P>After &s;ome further di&s;cour&s;e, they committed me to pri|&s;on again, there to lie till the next a&s;&s;ize; and colonel Kir|by gave order to the gaoler, <Q>To keep me clo&s;e, and &s;uffer no fle&s;h alive to come at me; for I was not fit,</Q> he &s;aid, 'to be di&s;cour&s;ed with by men.' I was put into a tower, where the &s;moke of the other pri&s;oners came up &s;o thick, it &s;tood as dew upon the walls, and &s;ometimes it was &s;o thick that I could hardly &s;ee the candle when it burned; and I being locked under three locks, the under-gaoler, when the &s;moke was great, would hardly be per&s;uaded to come up to unlock one of the uppermo&s;t doors, for fear of the &s;moke, &s;o that I was almo&s;t &s;mothered. Be&s;ides it rained in upon my bed, and many times, when I went to &s;top out the rain in the cold winter-&s;ea&s;on, my &s;hirt was as wet as muck with the rain that came in upon me while I was labouring to &s;top it out. And the place being high and open to the wind, &s;ometimes as fa&s;t as I &s;topped it the wind blew it out again. In this manner did I lay all that long cold winter till the next a&s;&s;ize, in which time I was &s;o &s;tarved with cold and rain, that my body was greatly &s;welled, and my limbs much benumbed.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;ize began the &s;ixteenth of the month called March 1661-5. The &s;ame judges, Twi&s;den and Turner, coming,
<PB N="60" REF="037441_0576_100D91D48FFF7968">that circuit again, judge Twi&s;den &s;at this time on the crown|bench, and before him I was brought. I had informed my|&s;elf of the errors in this indictment al&s;o. For though at the a&s;&s;ize before, judge Turner &s;aid to the officers in court, <Q>Pray, &s;ee that all the oath be in the indictment, and that the word Subject be in, and that the day of the month and year of the king be put in right; for it is a &s;hame that &s;o many errors &s;hould be &s;een and found in the face of the country;</Q> yet many errors, and tho&s;e great ones, were in this indictment as well as in the former. Surely the hand of the Lord was in it, to confound their mi&s;chievous work again&s;t me, and to blind them therein; in&s;omuch that al|though, after the indictment was drawn at the former a&s;&s;ize, the judge examined it him&s;elf, and tried it with the clerks, yet the word Subject was left out of this indictment al&s;o, the day of the month was put in wrong, and &s;everal mate|rial words of the oath were left out; yet they went on con|&s;idently again&s;t me, thinking all was &s;afe and well. When I was &s;et to the bar, and the jury called over to be &s;worn, the clerk a&s;ked me, fir&s;t, <Q>Whether I had any objection to make to any of the jury?</Q> I told him, <Q>I knew none of them.</Q> Then, having &s;worn the jury, they &s;wore three of the officers of the court, to prove, <Q>That the oath was tendered to me at the la&s;t a&s;&s;izes, according to the indict|ment.</Q> 'Come, come,' &s;aid the judge, <Q>it was not done in a corner.</Q> Then he a&s;ked me, <Q>What I had to &s;ay to it; or whether I had taken the oath at the la&s;t a&s;&s;ize?</Q> I told him what I had formerly &s;aid to them, as it now came to my remembrance. Whereupon the judge &s;aid, <Q>I will not di&s;pute with you but in point of law.</Q> 'Then,' &s;aid I, <Q>I have &s;omething to &s;peak to the jury concerning the indictment.</Q> He told me, <Q>I mu&s;t not &s;peak to the jury; but if I had any thing to &s;ay, I mu&s;t &s;peak to him.</Q> I a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether the oath was to be tendered to the king's &s;ubjects only, or to the &s;ubjects of foreign princes?</Q> He replied, <Q>To the &s;ubjects of this realm; for I will &s;peak nothing to you,</Q> &s;aid he, 'but in point of law.' 'Then,' &s;aid I, <Q>look in the indictment, and thou maye&s;t &s;ee the word Subject is left out of this indictment al&s;o. There|fore, &s;eeing the oath is not to be tendered to any but the &s;ubjects of this realm, and ye have not put me in as a &s;ubject, the court is to take no notice of this indictment.</Q> I had no &s;ooner &s;poke thus, but the judge cried, <Q>Take him away, gaoler, take him away.</Q> So I was pre&s;ently
<PB N="61" REF="037441_0577_100D91D6D3655CD0">hurried away. The gaoler and people looked when I &s;hould be called for again; but I was never brought to the court any more, though I had many other great errors to a&s;&s;ign in the indictment. After I was gone, the judge a&s;ked the jury, 'If they were agreed?' They &s;aid, 'Yes;' and found for the king again&s;t me, as I was told. But I was never called to hear &s;entence given, nor was any given again&s;t me that I could hear of. I under&s;tand, when they looked narrowly into the indictment, they &s;aw it was not good; and the judge having &s;worn the officers of the court, that the oath was tendered me at the a&s;&s;ize before, &s;uch a day, according as was &s;et in the indictment, and that being the wrong day, I &s;hould have proved the officers of the court for&s;worn men again, if the judge would have &s;uffered me to plead to the indictment; which was thought to be the rea&s;on why he hurried me away &s;o &s;oon. The judge had pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence of premunire upon Margaret Fell be|fore I was brought in; and it &s;eems, when I was hurried away, they recorded me as a premunired per&s;on, though I was never brought to hear the &s;entence, nor knew of it; which was very illegal. For they ought not only to have had me pre&s;ent to hear the &s;entence given, but al&s;o to have a&s;ked me fir&s;t, <Q>What I could &s;ay why &s;entence &s;hould not be given again&s;t me?</Q> But they knew I had &s;o much to &s;ay they could not give &s;entence if they heard me.</P>
<P>While I was pri&s;oner in Lanca&s;ter ca&s;tle, there was great noi&s;e and talk of the Turk's over&s;preading Chri&s;tendom, and great fears entered many. But one day, as I was walk|ing in my pri&s;on-chamber, <Q>I &s;aw the Lord's power turn again&s;t him, and that he was turning back again.</Q> I de|clared to &s;ome what the Lord had let me &s;ee, when there were &s;uch fears of his over-running Chri&s;tendom; and with|in a month after the news came down, wherein it was men|tioned, 'They had given him a defeat.'</P>
<P>Another time, as I was walking in my chamber, with my eye to the Lord, <Q>I &s;aw the angel of the Lord, with a glit|tering drawn &s;word &s;tretched &s;outhward, as though the court had been all on a fire.</Q> Not long after the wars broke out with Holland, the &s;ickne&s;s broke forth, and after|wards the fire of London; &s;o the Lord's &s;word was drawn indeed.</P>
<P>By rea&s;on of my long and clo&s;e impri&s;onment in &s;o bad a place, I was become very weak of body; but the Lord's power was over all, &s;upported me through all, and enabled
<PB N="62" REF="037441_0578_100D91D935D0CB60">me to do &s;ervice for him, and for his truth and people, as the place would admit. For while I was in Lanca&s;ter pri|&s;on, I an&s;wered &s;everal books, as the Ma&s;s, the Common|prayer, the Directory, and the Church-faith; which are the four chief religions that are got up &s;ince the apo&s;tles days. And there being &s;everal friends in pri&s;on at Lanca&s;ter and other pri&s;ons for not paying tithes, I was moved to publi&s;h the following lines concerning tithes:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>IN the time of the law, tho&s;e that did not bring their tithes into the &s;tore-hou&s;e robbed God; then there was not meat in their hou&s;e; therefore the Lord commanded, <Q>To bring them into his hou&s;e, that there might be meat in the &s;tore-hou&s;e, which was to feed the fatherle&s;s, &s;tranger, and widow.</Q> But the&s;e prie&s;ts who are counterfeits, who take people's tithes now by a law, are from the bea&s;t; and if they will not pay them they pri&s;on them, or make them pay treble. The&s;e rob the, poor, rob the fatherle&s;s, and the &s;tranger and widow are not filled; &s;o their cry is gone up to heaven again&s;t the&s;e. Many are made almo&s;t beg|gars by the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ing prie&s;ts, their cattle and corn being taken away from them, and they ca&s;t into pri&s;on. Others are &s;ued at law by the prie&s;ts, and have treble damage ta|ken from them; yet &s;uch prie&s;ts are cried up to be mini&s;|ters of the go&s;pel. Though when the unchangeable prie&s;t was come, the prie&s;thood that was changeable was denied, as we now deny the&s;e. But if any be moved to cry again&s;t them, they are &s;tocked, beat, or impri&s;oned. Many are now in pri&s;on at Lanca&s;ter and other places by a national law, the like whereof was never done by the law of God delivered to Mo&s;es. We do not read that under Mo&s;es's law any &s;uffered impri&s;onment, or &s;poiling of goods for not paying tithes, or was to pay treble damage. Surely, &s;ure|ly, the cry for vengeance will be heard, which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es from the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ouls that lie under the altar. There are many pri&s;oners at Kendal, becau&s;e they cannot pay tithes, as captain Ward, Thomas Robert&s;on, and the widow Garland, who hath many &s;mall children: the&s;e &s;uffer be|cau&s;e they cannot pay tithes. Others there are in Kendal pri&s;on, who were moved of the Lord to &s;peak to the prie&s;ts, whereof one was moved to go in &s;ackcloth, and of late with a&s;hes upon her head. Others have been moved to go in &s;ackcloth, as a lamentation for the mi&s;erable e&s;tate of this nation, &s;eeing &s;o many crying up of the preaching of the
<PB N="63" REF="037441_0579_100D91DB242A0A98">go&s;pel, and yet &s;o much &s;trife, debate, oaths, and di&s;&s;en|&s;ion among people. But where the go&s;pel is received in|deed, &s;trife and contention are ended, and oppre&s;&s;ion is taken off. Oh! the land mourns, becau&s;e of the oppre&s;|&s;ion of tho&s;e called mini&s;ters! And though the cry of the oppre&s;&s;ed hath not entered into the ears of the magi&s;trates, yet is the cry of the poor oppre&s;&s;ed people of God entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath, who now will be avenged of all his adver&s;aries. You unju&s;t law-givers, and unju&s;t judges, to that in all your con&s;ciences I &s;peak, to be cleared, when ye are judged by the ju&s;t judge of hea|ven and earth; who&s;e terror is gone forth again&s;t all the ungodly, and all the oppre&s;&s;ors of God's people what&s;oe|ver, whether ye will hear or forbear.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After the a&s;&s;ize, colonel Kirby and other ju&s;tices were very unea&s;y with my being at Lanca&s;ter; for I had galled them &s;ore at my trials there, and they laboured much to get me removed from thence to &s;ome remote place. Colonel Kirby threatened I &s;hould be &s;ent far enough; &s;ometimes he &s;aid, 'I &s;hould be &s;ent beyond &s;ea.' About &s;ix weeks after the a&s;&s;izes, they got an order from the king and coun|cil to remove me from Lanca&s;ter; and with it they brought a letter from the earl of Angle&s;ey, wherein was written, <Q>That if tho&s;e things were found true again&s;t me, which I was charged withal, I de&s;erved no clemency nor mercy;</Q> yet the greate&s;t matter they had again&s;t me was, becau&s;e I could not di&s;obey the command of Chri&s;t, and &s;wear.</P>
<P>When they had prepared for my removal, the under|&s;heriff and the head-&s;heriff's man, with &s;ome bailiffs, came and fetched me out of the ca&s;tle, when I was &s;o weak with lying in that cold, wet, and &s;moky pri&s;on, that I could hardly go or &s;tand. They had me into the gaoler's hou&s;e, where was William Kirby and &s;everal others, and they cal|led for wine to give me. I told them, <Q>I would have none of their wine.</Q> Then they cried, 'Bring out the hor&s;es.' I de&s;ired them fir&s;t to &s;hew me their order, or a copy of it, if they intended to remove me; but they would &s;hew me none but their &s;words. I told them, <Q>There was no &s;en|tence pa&s;&s;ed upon me, nor was I premunired, that I knew of; and therefore I was not made the king's pri&s;oner, but was the &s;heriff's; for they and all the country knew, that I was not fully heard at the la&s;t a&s;&s;ize, nor &s;uffered to
<PB N="64" REF="037441_0580_100D91DD87B484D8">&s;hew the errors in the indictment, which were &s;ufficient to qua&s;h it, though they had kept me from one a&s;&s;ize to an|other, to the end they might try me. But they all knew there was no &s;entence of premunire pa&s;&s;ed upon me; therefore I, not being the king's pri&s;oner but the &s;heriff's, did de&s;ire to &s;ee their order.</Q> In&s;tead of &s;hewing me their order, they haled me out, and lifted me upon one of the &s;heriff's hor&s;es. When I was on hor&s;eback in the &s;treet, the town's people being gathered to gaze upon me, I told the officers, I had received neither Chri&s;tianity, civility, nor humanity from them. They hurried me away about four|teen miles to Bentham, though I was &s;o very weak that I was hardly able to &s;it on hor&s;eback, and my cloaths &s;melt &s;o of &s;moke they were loath&s;ome to my&s;elf. The wicked gaoler, one Hunter, a young fellow, would come behind and give the hor&s;e a la&s;h with his whip, and make him &s;kip and leap; &s;o that I, being weak, had much ado to &s;it on him; then he would come and look me in the face, and &s;ay, 'How do you, Mr. Fox?' I told him, <Q>It was not civil in him to do &s;o.</Q> The Lord cut him off &s;oon after.</P>
<P>When we were come to Bentham in York&s;hire, there met us many troopers and a mar&s;hal; and many of the gentry of the country were come in, and abundance of people to take a view of me. I being very weak and weary, de&s;ired them to let me lie down on a bed, which the &s;oldiers per|mitted; for tho&s;e that brought me thither gave their order to the mar&s;hal, and he &s;et a guard of his &s;oldiers upon me. When they had &s;taid awhile, they pre&s;&s;ed hor&s;es, rai&s;ed the bailiff of the hundred, the con&s;tables, and others, and had me to Giggle&s;wick that night; but exceeding weak I was. There they rai&s;ed the con&s;tables with their clog-&s;hoes, who &s;at drinking all the night in the room by me, &s;o that I could not get much re&s;t. Next day we came to a market-town, where &s;everal friends came to &s;ee me. Robert Widders and divers friends came to me upon the road. The next night I a&s;ked the &s;oldiers, <Q>Whither they intended to carry me, and whither I was to be &s;ent?</Q> Some of them &s;aid, <Q>Be|yond &s;ea,</Q> others &s;aid, 'To Tinmouth-ca&s;tle.' And a great fear there was among&s;t them, le&s;t &s;ome &s;hould re&s;cue me out of their hands; but that fear was needle&s;s. Next night we came to York, where the mar&s;hal put me up into a great chamber, where there came mo&s;t part of two troops to &s;ee me. One of tho&s;e oopers, an envious man, hearing I was premunired, a&s;ked me, <Q>What e&s;tate I had, and
<PB N="65" REF="037441_0581_100D91DF7649D7A8">whether it was copy-hold or free-land?</Q> I took no notice of his que&s;tion, but was moved to declare the word of life to the &s;oldiers, and many of them were very loving. At night lord Frecheville, who commanded tho&s;e hor&s;e, came to me, and was very civil and loving. I gave him an ac|count of my impri&s;onment, and declared many things to him relating to truth. They kept me at York two days, then the mar&s;hal and four or five &s;oldiers were &s;ent to con|vey me to Scarborough ca&s;tle. Indeed the&s;e were very ci|vil men, and carried them&s;elves civilly and lovingly to me. On the way we baited at Malton, and they permitted friends to come and vi&s;it me. When we were come to Scarborough, they had me to an inn, and gave notice to the governor, who &s;ent half a dozen &s;oldiers to be my guard that night. Next day they conducted me to the ca&s;tle, put me into a room, and &s;et a centry on me. I being very weak, and &s;ubject to fainting, they for awhile let me go out &s;ome|times into the air with a centry. They &s;oon removed me out of this room, and put me into an open room, where the rain came in; and the room &s;moked exceedingly, which was very offen&s;ive to me. One day the governor, who was call|ed Sir Jordan Cro&s;land, came to &s;ee me, and brought with him one called Sir Francis Cobb. I de&s;ired the governor to go into my room, and &s;ee what a place I had. I had got a little fire made in it, and the room was &s;o filled with &s;moke, that when they were in they could hardly find their way out again. He being a Papi&s;t, I told him that was his purgatory which they had put me into. I was forced to lay out about fifty &s;hillings to &s;top out the rain, and keep the room from &s;moking &s;o much. When I had been at that charge, and made it &s;omewhat tolerable, they removed me into a wor&s;e, where I had neither chimney nor fire-hearth. This being to the &s;ea-&s;ide, and lying much open, the wind drove in the rain forcibly, &s;o that the water came over my bed, and ran about the room, that I was fain to &s;kim it up with a platter. And when my clothes were wet, I had no fire to dry them; &s;o my body was numbed with cold, and my fingers &s;welled, that one was grown as big as two. Though I was at &s;ome charge on this room al&s;o, yet I could not keep out the wind and rain. Be&s;ides they would &s;uffer few friends to come at me, and many times not any, not &s;o much as to bring me a little food; but I was forced for the fir&s;t quarter, to hire one of another &s;ociety to bring me ne|ce&s;&s;aries. Sometimes the &s;oldiers would take it from her,
<PB N="66" REF="037441_0582_100D91E1C7ACAD08">and &s;he would &s;cuffle with them for it. Afterwards I hired a &s;oldier to fetch me water and bread, and &s;omething to make a fire of, when I was in a room where a fire could be made. Commonly a three-penny loaf &s;erved me three weeks, and &s;ometimes longer, and mo&s;t of my drink was water, with wormwood &s;teeped or brui&s;ed in it. One time, when the weather was very &s;harp, and I had taken a great cold, I got a little elecampane-beer; and I heard one of the &s;oldiers &s;ay to the other, <Q>They would play me a pretty trick, for they would &s;end for me up to the deputy-governor, and in the mean time drink my &s;trong beer out;</Q> and &s;o they did. When I returned, one of the &s;oldiers came to me in a jeer, and a&s;ked me for &s;ome &s;trong beer. I told him, They had played their pretty trick, and took no far|ther-notice of it. But ina&s;much as they kept me &s;o very &s;trait, not giving liberty for friends to come to me, I &s;poke to the keepers of the ca&s;tle to this effect: <Q>I did not know till I was removed from Lanca&s;ter ca&s;tle, and brought pri|&s;oner to this ca&s;tle of Scarborough, that I was convicted of a premunire; for the judge did not give &s;entence upon me at the a&s;&s;izes in open court. But &s;eeing I am now a pri&s;oner here, if I may not have my liberty, let my friends and acquaintance have their liberty to come and vi&s;it me, as Paul's friends had among the Romans, who were not Chri&s;tians but Heathens. For Paul's friends had their li|berty; all that would might come to him, and he had his liberty to preach to them in his hired hou&s;e; but I cannot have liberty to go into the town, nor for my friends to come to me here. So you, that go under the name of Chri&s;|tians, are wor&s;e in this re&s;pect than tho&s;e Heathens were.</Q></P>
<P>But though they would not let friends come to me, they would often bring others, either to gaze upon me or to con|tend with me.</P>
<P>One time came a great company of Papi&s;ts to di&s;cour&s;e with me, who affirmed, <Q>The pope was infallible, and had &s;tood infallible ever &s;ince Peter's time.</Q> I &s;hewed them the contrary by hi&s;tory: <Q>For one of the bi&s;hops of Rome, Marcellinus by name, denied the faith, and &s;a|crificed to idols; therefore he was not infallible. I told them, if they were in the Infallible Spirit, they need not have gaols, &s;words, &s;taves, racks, tortures, fires, whips, and gallows, to hold up their religion by, and to de&s;troy men's lives about religion; for if they were in the Infalli|ble Spirit, they would pre&s;erve men's lives, and u&s;e none
<PB N="67" REF="037441_0583_100D91E36410ECE8">but &s;piritual weapons about religion. I told them al&s;o what one that had been of their &s;ociety told me. A wo|man lived in Kent, who had not only been a Papi&s;t her|&s;elf, but had brought over &s;everal to that religion; but coming to be convinced of God's truth, and being turned by it to Chri&s;t, her Saviour, &s;he exhorted the Papi&s;ts to the &s;ame. One of them, a taylor, being at work at her hou&s;e, while &s;he opened to him the fal&s;ene&s;s of the Popi&s;h religion, and endeavoured to draw him from it to the truth, drew his knife, and got between her and the door. But &s;he &s;poke boldly to him, and bid him put up his knife, for &s;he knew his principle. I a&s;ked the woman, What &s;he thought he would have done with his knife? She &s;aid, "He would have &s;tabbed her." "Stab thee!" &s;aid I, <Q>What would he have &s;tabbed thee for? thy reli|gion?</Q> "Yes," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>It is the principle of the Pa|pi&s;ts, if any turn from their religion, to kill them if they can.</Q> This &s;tory I told tho&s;e Papi&s;ts, and that I had it from a per&s;on who had been one of them. but had for&s;ook their principles, and di&s;covered their practices. They did not deny this to be their principle, but &s;aid, What! would I declare this abroad? I told them, Yes, &s;uch things ought to be declared abroad, that it might be known how con|trary their religion was to true Chri&s;tianity;</Q> whereupon they went away in a great rage.</P>
<P>Another Papi&s;t came to di&s;cour&s;e with me, who &s;aid, <Q>All the patriarchs were in hell from the creation till Chri&s;t came, and that when Chri&s;t &s;uffered he went into hell, and the devil &s;aid to him, What come&s;t thou hither for, to break open our &s;trong bolds? And Chri&s;t &s;aid, To fetch them all out. So,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>Chri&s;t was three days and three nights in hell to bring them out.</Q> I told him, that was fal&s;e; for Chri&s;t &s;aid to the thief, <Q>This day thou &s;halt be with the in paradi&s;e.</Q> And Enoch and Elijah were tran&s;lated into heaven. And Abraham was in heaven: for the &s;cripture &s;aith, <Q>Lazarus was in his bo&s;om; and Mo&s;es and Elias were with Chri&s;t upon the mount before he &s;uffered.</Q> The&s;e in&s;tances &s;topped the Papi&s;t's mouth, and put him to a &s;tand.</P>
<P>Another time came Dr. Witty, who was e&s;teemed a great doctor in phy&s;ick, with lord Falconbridge, the governor of Tinmouth ca&s;tle, and &s;everal knights. I being called to them, Witty undertook to di&s;cour&s;e with me, and a&s;ked me, 'What I was in pri&s;on for?' I told him, <Q>Becau&s;e I
<PB N="68" REF="037441_0584_100D91E559D53090">would not di&s;obey the command of Chri&s;t, and &s;wear.</Q> He &s;aid, 'I ought to &s;wear my allegiance to the king.' He being a great Pre&s;byterian, I a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether he had not &s;worn again&s;t the king and hou&s;e of lords, and taken the Scotch covenant? And had he not &s;ince &s;worn to the king? What then was his &s;wearing good for? But my allegiance,</Q> I told him, <Q>did not con&s;i&s;t in &s;wearing, but in truth and faithfulne&s;s.</Q> After &s;ome further di&s;|cour&s;e, I was had away to my pri&s;on again; and afterwards Dr. Witty boa&s;ted in the town among&s;t his patients, that he had conquered me. When I heard of it, I told the governor, <Q>It was a &s;mall boa&s;t in him to &s;ay, He had con|quered a bondman.</Q> I de&s;ired to bid him come to me again, when he came to the ca&s;tle. He came again awhile after, with about &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen great per&s;ons, and then he ran him&s;elf wor&s;e on ground than before. For he affirmed before them all, <Q>That Chri&s;t had not enlightened every man that cometh into the world;</Q> and <Q>that the grace of God, that brought &s;alvation, had not appeared unto all men, and that Chri&s;t had not died for all men.</Q> I a&s;ked him, what &s;ort of men tho&s;e were which Chri&s;t had not enlightened? and whom his grace had not appeared to? and whom he had not died for? He &s;aid, <Q>Chri&s;t did not die for adulterers, and idolaters, and wicked men.</Q> I a&s;k|ed him, <Q>Whether adulterers and wicked men were not &s;inners?</Q> He &s;aid, 'Yes.' 'Did not Chri&s;t die for &s;in|ners?' '&s;aid I. 'Did he not come to call &s;inners to re|pentance?' 'Yes,' &s;aid he. 'Then,' &s;aid I, <Q>thou ha&s;t &s;topped thy own mouth.</Q> So I proved, that the grace of God had appeared unto all men, though &s;ome turned from it into wantonne&s;s, and walked de&s;pitefully again&s;t it; and that Chri&s;t had enlightened all men, though &s;ome hated the light. Several of the people confe&s;&s;ed it was true; but he went away in a great rage, and came no more to me.</P>
<P>Another time the governor brought a prie&s;t; but his mouth was &s;oon &s;topped. Not long after he brought two or three parliament-men, who a&s;ked me, <Q>Whether I did own mini&s;ters and bi&s;hops?</Q> I told them, <Q>Yes, &s;uch as Chri&s;t &s;ent, &s;uch as had freely received, and would freely give, &s;uch as were qualified, and were in the &s;ame power and &s;pirit the apo&s;tles were in. But &s;uch bi&s;hops and teachers as theirs, that would go no farther than a great benefice, I did not own; for they were not like the apo&s;|tles. Chri&s;t &s;aith to his mini&s;ters, <Q>Go ye into all na|tions,
<PB N="69" REF="037441_0585_100D91E7A2CBDA28">and preach the go&s;pel;</Q> but ye parliament-men, <Q>who keep your prie&s;ts and bi&s;hops in &s;uch great fat benefi|ces, have &s;poiled them all. For do ye think they will go into all nations to preach? or will go any farther than a great fat benefice? Judge your&s;elves whether they will or no.</Q></Q></P>
<P>There came another time the widow of old lord Fairfax, and with her a great company; one of whom was a prie&s;t. I was moved to declare the truth to them, and the prie&s;t a&s;k|ed me, <Q>Why we &s;aid Thou and Thee to people? for he counted us but fools and idiots for &s;peaking &s;o.</Q> I a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether tho&s;e that tran&s;lated the &s;criptures, and made the grammar and accidence, were fools and idiots, &s;eeing they tran&s;lated the &s;criptures &s;o, and made the grammar &s;o, Thou to one, and You to more than one, and left it &s;o to us? If they were fools and idiots, why had not he and &s;uch as he, who looked upon them&s;elves as wi&s;e men, and could not bear Thou and Thee to a &s;ingular, altered the grammar, accidence, and bible, and put the plural in&s;tead of the &s;ingular? But if they were wi&s;e men, that &s;o tran&s;lated the bible, and made the grammar and acci|dence &s;o, I wi&s;hed him to con&s;ider, whether they were not fools and idiots them&s;elves, that did not &s;peak as their grammars and bibles taught them; but were offended with us, and called us fools and idiots for &s;peaking &s;o?</Q> Thus the prie&s;t's mouth was &s;topped, many of the compa|ny acknowledged the truth, and were pretty loving and ten|der. Some would have given me money, but I would not receive it.</P>
<P>After this came Dr. Cradock, with three prie&s;ts more, and the governor with his lady (&s;o called) and another that was called a lady, with a great company. Dr. Cradock a&s;ked me, 'What I was in pri&s;on for?' I told him, <Q>For obeying the command of Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tle, in not &s;wearing. But if he, being both a doctor and a ju&s;tice, could convince me, that after Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tle had forbid &s;wearing, they commanded Chri&s;tians to &s;wear, then I would &s;wear. Here was the bible, I told him, he might if he could &s;hew me any &s;uch command.</Q> He &s;aid. <Q>It is written, ye &s;hall &s;wear in truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q> 'Aye.' <Q>&s;aid I, 'it was written &s;o in Jeremiah's time; but that was many ages before Chri&s;t commanded not to &s;wear at all; but where is it written &s;o &s;ince Chri&s;t forbad all &s;wearing? I could bring as many in&s;tances out of the Old Te&s;tament
<PB N="70" REF="037441_0586_100D91E99378B5F0">for &s;wearing as thou, and it may be more; but of what force are they to prove &s;wearing lawful in the New Te&s;ta|ment &s;ince Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tle forbad it? Be&s;ides,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>in that text where it is written, "Ye &s;hall &s;wear," what [Ye] was this? Was it Ye Gentiles, or Ye Jews?</Q> To this he would not an&s;wer; but one of the prie&s;ts that were with him an&s;wered. <Q>It was to the Jews that this was &s;po|ken.</Q> Then Dr. Cradock confe&s;&s;ed it was &s;o.' 'Very well,' &s;aid I, <Q>but where did God ever give a command to the Gentiles to &s;wear? For thou knowe&s;t that we are Gentiles by nature.</Q> 'Indeed,' &s;aid he, <Q>in the go&s;pel-times every thing was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed out of the mouths of two or three witne&s;&s;es; but there was to be no &s;wearing then.</Q> 'Why then,' &s;aid I, <Q>do&s;t thou force oaths upon Chri&s;ti|ans, contrary to thy own knowledge, in the go&s;pel-times? And why,</Q> &s;aid I, 'do&s;t thou excommunicate my friends?' (for he had excommunicated abundance both in York&s;hire and Lanca&s;hire.) He &s;aid, 'For not coming to church.' 'Why,' &s;aid I, <Q>ye left us above twenty years ago, when we were but young lads and la&s;&s;es, to the Pre&s;byterians, Independents, and Bapti&s;ts, many of whom made &s;poil of our goods, and per&s;ecuted us becau&s;e we would not follow them. We being but young, knew little then of your principles, and the old men that did know them, if ye had intended to have kept them to you, and have kept your principles alive, that we might have known them, ye &s;hould either not have fled from us as ye did, or ye &s;hould have &s;ent us your epi&s;tles, collects, homilies, and evening &s;ongs; for Paul wrote epi&s;tles to the &s;aints, though he was in pri&s;on. But they and we might have turned Turks or Jews for any collects, homilies, or epi&s;tles we had from you all this while. And now thou ha&s;t excommunicated 'us, both young and old, and &s;o have others of you done; that is, <Q>Ye have put us out of your church, before ye have got us into it,</Q> and before ye have brought us to know your principles. Is not this madne&s;s in you, to put us out before we were brought in? Indeed, if ye had brought us into your church, and when we had been in, if we had done &s;ome bad thing, that had been &s;omething like a ground for excommunication or putting out again. But,' &s;aid I, 'What do&s;t thou call the church?' 'Why,' &s;aid he, 'that which you call the &s;teeple-hou&s;e,' Then I afted him, 'Whether Chri&s;t &s;hed his blood for the &s;teeple-hou&s;e? and purcha&s;ed and &s;anctified the &s;teeple-hou&s;e
<PB N="71" REF="037441_0587_100D91EB2391E560">with his blood? And &s;eeing the church is Chri&s;t's bride and wife, and that he is the head of the church, do&s;t thou think the &s;teeple-hou&s;e is Chri&s;t's wife and bride, and that he is the head of that old hou&s;e, or of his people? No,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>Chri&s;t is the head of his people, and they are the church.</Q> 'But,' &s;aid I, <Q>you have given the title church to an old hou&s;e, which belongs to the people; and you have taught them to believe &s;o.</Q> I a&s;ked him al&s;o, <Q>Why he per&s;ecuted friends for not paying tithes? And whether God ever commanded the Gentiles to pay tithes? And whether Chri&s;t had not ended tithes when he ended the Levitical prie&s;thood that took tithes? And whether Chri&s;t, when he &s;ent his di&s;ciples to preach, had not commanded them to preach freely as he had given them freely? And whether all the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are not bound to ob&s;erve this command of Chri&s;t?</Q> He &s;aid, 'He would not di&s;pute 'that.' Neither did I find he was willing to &s;tay on that &s;ub|ject; for he pre&s;ently turned to another matter, and &s;aid, <Q>You marry, but I know not how.</Q> I replied, <Q>It may be &s;o: but why do&s;t thou not come and &s;ee?</Q> Then he <Q>threatened that he would u&s;e his power again&s;t us, as he had done.</Q> I bid him. 'Take heed; for he was an old man.' I a&s;ked him al&s;o, <Q>Where he read from Gene&s;is to Revelations, that ever any prie&s;t did marry any? I wi&s;hed him to &s;hew me &s;ome in&s;tance thereof, if he would have us come to them to be married; for, &s;aid I, thou ha&s;t excommunicated one of my friends two years after he was dead, about his mar|riage. And why do&s;t thou not excommunicate I&s;aac, and Jacob, and Boaz, and Ruth? For we do not read they were ever married by the prie&s;ts; but they took one ano|ther in the a&s;&s;emblies of the righteous, in the pre&s;ence of God and his people; and &s;o do we. So that we have all the holy men and women, that the &s;cripture &s;peaks of in this practice, on our &s;ide.</Q> Much di&s;cour&s;e we had; but when he found he could get no advantage on me, he went away with his company.</P>
<P>With &s;uch people I was much exerci&s;ed while I was there; for mo&s;t that came to the ca&s;tle would de&s;ire to &s;peak with me, and great di&s;putes I had with them. But as to friends, I was as a man buried alive; for though many came far to &s;ee me, few were &s;uffered to come at me; and when any friend came into the ca&s;tle about bu&s;ine&s;s, if he looked but towards me, they would rage at him. At la&s;t the governor came under trouble him&s;elf; for having &s;ent
<PB N="72" REF="037441_0588_100D91ED1BD2E108">out a privateer to &s;ea, they took &s;ome &s;hips that were not enemies &s;hips, but their friends; whereupon he was brought into trouble; after which he grew &s;omewhat more friendly to me. For before I had a mar&s;hal &s;et over me, on pur|po&s;e to get money out of me; but I was not to give him a farthing; and when they found they could get nothing from me, he was taken off again. The officers often threatered me, that I &s;hould be hanged over the wall. Nay, the de|puty-governor told me once, that the king, knowing I had great intere&s;t in the people had &s;ent me thither; that if there &s;hould be any &s;tirring in the nation, they &s;hould hang m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> over the wall to keep the people down. There being awhile after a marriage at a Papi&s;t's hou&s;e, upon which occa&s;ion a great many of them were met together, they talked much then of hanging me. But I told them, <Q>If that was what they de&s;ired, and it was permitted them, I was ready; for I never feared death nor &s;ufferings in my life; but I was known to be an innocent, peaceable man, free from all &s;tirrings and plottings, and one that &s;ought the good of all men.</Q> Afterwards, the governor growing kinder, I &s;poke to him, when he was to go to London to the parliament. and de&s;ired him to &s;peak to '&s;quire Mar&s;h, Sir Francis Cobb, and &s;ome others; and let them know how long I had lain in pri&s;on, and for what: which he did. When he came down again, he told me, '&s;quire Mar&s;h &s;aid, <Q>He would go an hundred miles barefoot for my liberty, he knew me &s;o well;</Q> and &s;everal others, he &s;aid, &s;poke well of me. From which time the governor was very loving to me.</P>
<P>There were among&s;t the pri&s;oners two very bad men, who often fat drinking with the officers and &s;oldiers; and becau&s;e I would not &s;it and drink with them, it made them the wor&s;e again&s;t me. One time, when the&s;e two pri&s;oners were drunk, one of them (who&s;e name was William Wil|kin&s;on, a Pre&s;byterian, who had been a captain) came and challenged me to fight with him. I &s;eeing what condition he was in, got out of his way; and next morning, when he was more &s;ober, &s;hewed him, <Q>How unmanly a thing it was in him to challenge a man to fight, who&s;e principle, he knew it, was not to &s;trike; but if he was &s;tricken on one ear, to turn the other. I told him, if he had a mind to fight, he &s;hould have challenged &s;ome of the &s;oldiers, that could have an&s;wered him in his own way. But however, &s;eeing he had challenged me, I was now come to an&s;wer
<PB N="73" REF="037441_0589_100D91EF82E2EC10">him, with my hands in my pockets: and (reaching my head towards him) Here &s;aid I, here is my hair, here are my cheeks, here is my back.</Q> With that he &s;k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pped away from me, and went into another room: at which the &s;ol|diers fell a laughing; and one of the officers &s;aid, <Q>You are a happy man that can bear &s;uch things.</Q> Thus he was conquered without a blow. After awhile he took the oath, gave bond, got out of pri&s;on; and not long after the Lord cut him off.</P>
<P>There were great impri&s;onments in this and the former years, while I was pri&s;oner at Lanca&s;ter and Scarborough. At London many friends were crowded into Newgate, and other pri&s;ons, where the &s;ickne&s;s was; and many died in pri&s;on. Many al&s;o were bani&s;hed, and &s;everal &s;ent on &s;hip|board by the king's order. Some ma&s;ters of &s;hips would not carry them, but &s;et them on &s;hore again; yet &s;ome were &s;ent to Barbadoes, Jamaica, and Mevis, and the Lord ble&s;|&s;ed them there. One ma&s;ter of a &s;hip was very wicked and cruel to friends that were put on board his &s;hip; for he kept them down under decks, though the &s;ickne&s;s was among&s;t them; &s;o that many died of it. But the Lord vi&s;ited him for his wickedne&s;s; for he lo&s;t mo&s;t of his &s;eamen by the plague, and lay &s;everal months cro&s;&s;ed with contrary winds, though other &s;hips went out, and made their voyages. At la&s;t he came before Plymouth, where the governor and ma|gi&s;trates would not &s;uffer him nor any of his men to come a&s;hore, though he wanted nece&s;&s;aries for his voyage; but Thomas Lower, Arthur Cotton; John Light, and other friends went to the &s;hip's &s;ide, and carried nece&s;&s;aries for the friends that were pri&s;oners on board. The ma&s;ter, being thus cro&s;&s;ed and vexed; cur&s;ed them that put him upon this freight; and &s;aid, <Q>He hoped he &s;hould not go far before he was taken.</Q> And the ve&s;&s;el was but a little while gone out of &s;ight of Plymouth, before &s;he was taken by a Dutch man of war, and carried into Holland. When they came into Holland, the States &s;ent the bani&s;hed friends back to England, with a letter of pa&s;&s;port, and a certificate, <Q>That they had not made an e&s;cape, but were &s;ent back by them.</Q> In time the Lord's power wrought over this &s;torm, and ma|ny of our per&s;ecutors were confounded and put to &s;hame.</P>
<P>After I had lain pri&s;oner above a year in Scarborough ca&s;tle, I &s;ent a letter to the king, in which I gave him <Q>an account of my impri&s;onment, and the bad u&s;age I had re|ceived in pri&s;on; and al&s;o that I was informed no man
<PB N="74" REF="037441_0590_100D91F1D42D2170">could deliver me but he.</Q> After this, John Whitehead being at London, and having acquaintance al&s;o with &s;quire Mar&s;h, he went to vi&s;it him, and &s;poke to him about me; and he undertook, if John Whitehead would get the &s;tate of my ca&s;e drawn up, to deliver it to the ma&s;ter of reque&s;ts, Sir John Birkenhead, who would endeavour to get a relea&s;e for me. So John Whitehead and Ellis Hookes drew up a relation of my impri&s;onment and &s;ufferings, and carried it to Mar&s;h; and he went with it to the ma&s;ter of reque&s;ts, who procured an order from the king for my relea&s;e. The &s;ub|&s;tance of the order was, <Q>That the king being certainly in|formed that I was a man principled again&s;t plotting and fighting, and had been ready at all times to di&s;cover plots, rather than to make any, &amp;c. therefore his royal plea&s;ure was, that I &s;hould be di&s;charged from my impri&s;onment,</Q> &amp;c. As &s;oon as this order was obtained, John Whitehead came to Scarborough with it, and delivered it to the go|vernor; who, upon receipt thereof, gathered the officers together, and, without requiring bond or &s;ureties for my peaceable living, being &s;atisfied that I was a man of a peace|able life, he di&s;charged me freely, and gave me the follow|ing pa&s;&s;port:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>PERMIT the bearer hereof, George Fox, late a pri&s;on|er here, and now di&s;charged by his maje&s;ty's order, quietly to pa&s;s about his lawful occa&s;ions, without any mole&s;tation.</P>
<CLOSER><DATELINE>Given under my hand at Scarborough ca&s;tle, <DATE>this fir&s;t day of September, 1666.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SIGNED>JORDAN CROSLANDS, Governor of Scarborough ca&s;tle.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>After I was relea&s;ed, I would have made the governor a pre&s;ent for the civility and kindne&s;s he had of late &s;hewed me; but he would not receive any thing; &s;aying, <Q>What|ever good he could do for me and my friends, he would do it, and never do them any hurt.</Q> And afterwards, if at any time the mayor of the town &s;ent to him for &s;oldiers to break up friends meetings, if he &s;ent any down, he would pri|vately give them a charge, 'Not to meddle.' He continu|ed loving to his dying-day. The officers al&s;o and the &s;ol|diers were mightily changed, and become very re&s;pectful to me. When they had occa&s;ion to &s;peak of me, they would
<PB N="75" REF="037441_0591_100D91F365EDA3F8">&s;ay, <Q>He is as &s;tiff as a tree, and as pure as a bell; for we could never bow him.</Q></P>
<P>The very next day after my relea&s;e, the fire broke out in London; and the report of it came quickly down into the country. Then I &s;aw the Lord God was true and ju&s;t in his word, which he had &s;hewed me before in Lanca&s;ter gaol, when I &s;aw the angel of the Lord with a glittering drawn &s;word &s;outhward, as before expre&s;&s;ed. The people of Lon|don were forewarned of this fire: yet few laid it to heart, or believed it; but rather grew more wicked, and higher in pride. A friend was moved to come out of Huntingdon|&s;hire a little before the &s;ire, and to &s;catter his money up and down the &s;treets, turn his hor&s;e loo&s;e, untie the knees of his breeches, and let his &s;tockings fall down, and to unbutton his doublet, and tell the people, 'So &s;hould they run up and down, &s;cattering their money and goods, half undre&s;&s;ed, like 'mad people, as he was a &s;ign to them;' which they did when the city was burning. Thus hath the Lord exerci&s;ed his prophets and &s;ervants by his power, &s;hewed them &s;igns of his judgments, and &s;ent them to forewarn the people; but in&s;tead of repenting, they have beaten and cruelly entreat|ed &s;ome; and &s;ome they have impri&s;oned, both in the for|mer power's days, and &s;ince. But the Lord is ju&s;t; and happy are they that obey his word. Some have been mov|ed to go naked in their &s;treets, in the other power's days, and &s;ince, as &s;igns of their nakedne&s;s; and have declared among&s;t them, <Q>That God would &s;trip them of their hypo|critical profe&s;&s;ions, and make them as bare and naked as they were.</Q> But, in&s;tead of con&s;idering it, they have fre|quently whipped, or otherwi&s;e abu&s;ed them, and &s;ome|times impri&s;oned them. Others have been moved to go in &s;ackcloth, and to denounce the woes and vengeance of God again&s;t the pride and haughtine&s;s of the people; but few regarded it. And in the other power's days, the wick|ed, envious, profe&s;&s;ing prie&s;ts put up &s;everal petitions both to Oliver and Richard, called protectors, and to the parlia|ments, judges, and ju&s;tices again&s;t us, &s;tuffed full of lies, and vilifying words and &s;landers; but we got copies of them, and through the Lord's a&s;&s;i&s;tance an&s;wered the all, and cleared the Lord's truth and our&s;elves of them. But oh! the body of darkne&s;s that ro&s;e again&s;t the truth, in them that made lies their refuge! But the Lord &s;wept them away; and in and with his power, truth, light, and life hedged his lambs about, and pre&s;erved them as on eagles'
<PB N="76" REF="037441_0592_100D91F4F8702E60">wings. Therefore we all had and have great encourage|ment to tru&s;t the Lord, who, we &s;aw, by his power and Spirit, overturned and brought to nought all the confedera|cies and coun&s;els that were hatched in darkne&s;s again&s;t his trath and people; and by the &s;ame truth gave his people dominion, that therein they might &s;erve him.</P>
<P>Indeed, I could not but take notice how the hand of the Lord turned again&s;t tho&s;e my per&s;ecutors who had been the cau&s;e of my impri&s;onment, or had been abu&s;ive or cruel to me under it. For the officer that fetched me to Houlker|hall wa&s;ted his e&s;tate, and &s;oon after fled into Ireland. And mo&s;t of the ju&s;tices that were upon the bench at the &s;e&s;&s;ions when I was &s;ent to pri&s;on died in awhile after; as old Tho|mas Pre&s;ten, Rawlin&s;on, Porter, and Matthew We&s;t of Borwick. And ju&s;tice Fleming's wife died, and left him thirteen or fourteen motherle&s;s children; who had impri|&s;oned two friends to death, and thereby made &s;everal chil|dren fatherle&s;s. Colonel Kirby never pro&s;pered after. The chief con&s;table, Richard Dodg&s;on, died &s;oon after; and Mount, the petty con&s;table, and the wife of John A&s;hbum|ham the other petty con&s;table, who railed at me in her hou&s;e, died &s;oon after. William Knipe, the witne&s;s they brought again&s;t me, died &s;oon after. Hunter, the gaoler of Lanca&s;ter, who was very wicked to me while I was his pri&s;oner, was cut off in his young days. The under &s;he|riff, that carried me from Lanca&s;ter pri&s;on towards Scarbo|rough, lived not long after. And Joblin, the gaoler of Durham, who was pri&s;oner with me in Scarborough ca&s;tle, and had often incen&s;ed the governor and &s;oldiers again&s;t me, though he got out of pri&s;on, the Lord cut him off in his wickedne&s;s &s;oon after. When I came into that country again, mo&s;t of tho&s;e that dwelt in Lanca&s;hire were dead, and others ruined in their e&s;tates: &s;o that, though I did not &s;eek revenge upon them, for their actings again&s;t me contrary to the law, yet the Lord had executed his judg|ments upon many of them.</P>
<P>Being now at liberty, I went about three miles to a large general meeting at a friend's hou&s;e, who had been a chief con&s;table; and all was quiet and well. On fourth-day af|ter I returned to Scarborough, and had a meeting in the town at Peter Hodg&s;on's. To this meeting came one call|ed a lady, and &s;everal other great per&s;ons; al&s;o a young man, &s;on to the bailiff of the town, who had been convinc|ed while I was there in pri&s;on. That lady (&s;o called) came
<PB N="77" REF="037441_0593_100D91F7A736F890">to me, and &s;aid, 'I &s;poke again&s;t the mini&s;ters.' I told her, <Q>Such as the prophets and Chri&s;t declared again&s;t for|merly, I declared again&s;t now.</Q></P>
<P>From hence I went to Whitby: and, having vi&s;ited friends there, pa&s;&s;ed to Burlington, where I had another meeting. From thence to Oram, where I had another meeting; and thence to Marmaduke Storr's, and had a large meeting at a con&s;table's hou&s;e, on whom the Lord had wrought a great miracle.</P>
<P>Next day two friends being to take each other in marri|age, there was a very great meeting, which I attended. I was moved to open the &s;tate of our marriages, declaring, <Q>How the people of God took one another in the a&s;&s;emblies of the elders; and that it was God who joined man and woman together before the fall. And though men had tak|en upon them to join in the fall, yet in the re&s;toration it is God's joining that is the right and honourable marriage; but never any prie&s;t did marry any, that we read of in the &s;criptures, from Gene&s;is to Revelations.</Q> Then I &s;hewed them the duty of man and wife, how they &s;hould &s;erve God, being heirs of life and grace together.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed from thence to Grace Barwick's, where I had a general meeting, which was very large. I came next to Richard Shipton's, where I had another meeting; and to a prie&s;t's hou&s;e, who&s;e wife was convinced, and him&s;elf grown very loving, and glad to &s;ee me. This was that prie&s;t, who, in the year 1651, threatened, <Q>If ever he met with me again, he would have my life, or I &s;hould have his;</Q> and &s;aid, <Q>He would lo&s;e his head if I were not knocked down in a month;</Q> but now he was partly convinced, and become very kind. I went from his hou&s;e towards the &s;ea, where &s;everal friends came to vi&s;it me: among&s;t others, Philip Scarff, who had formerly been a prie&s;t, but, having receiv|ed the truth, was now become a preacher of Chri&s;t freely, and continued &s;o. Pa&s;&s;ing on, I called to &s;ee an ancient man, who was convinced of truth, and was above an hun|dred years old. Then I came to a friend's hou&s;e, where I had a great meeting, and quiet. I had a great meeting near Malton; and another large one near Hull: from whence I went to Holdendike. As we went into the town, the watch|men que&s;tioned me and tho&s;e that were with me; but they not having any warrant to &s;tay us, we pa&s;&s;ed by them, and they in a rage threatened they would &s;earch us out. I went to the hou&s;e of one called the lady Montague, where I lodg|ed
<PB N="78" REF="037441_0594_100D91F9A1A63648">that night; and &s;everal friends came to vi&s;it me. Next morning, being up betimes, I walked into the orchard, and &s;aw a man about &s;un-ri&s;ing go into the hou&s;e in a great cloak. He &s;taid not long; but &s;oon came out again, and went away, not &s;eeing me. I felt &s;omething &s;trike at my life; and went into the hou&s;e, where I found the maid-&s;er|vant affrighted and trembling. She told me, <Q>That man had a naked rapier under his cloak.</Q> By which I perceiv|ed he came with an intent to have done mi&s;chief; but the Lord prevented him.</P>
<P>I then vi&s;ited friends till I came to York, where we had a large meeting. After which I went to vi&s;it ju&s;tice Robin|&s;on, an ancient ju&s;tice of peace; who had been very loving to me and friends from the beginning. There was a prie&s;t with him; who told me, <Q>It was &s;aid, that we loved none but our&s;elves.</Q> I told him, <Q>We loved all mankind as they were God's creation, and as they were children of Adam and Eve by generation; and we loved the brother|hood in the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> This &s;topped him. After &s;ome other di&s;cour&s;e, we parted friendly, and pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>About this time I wrote a book, intituled, <Q>Fear God, and honour the king;</Q> in which I &s;hewed, <Q>That none could rightly fear God, and honour the king, but they that departed from &s;in and evil:</Q> This book did much affect the &s;oldiers and mo&s;t people.</P>
<P>Having vi&s;ited friends at York, we pa&s;&s;ed to a market town, where we had a meeting at George Watkin&s;on's, who formerly had been a ju&s;tice. A glorious, ble&s;&s;ed meeting it was, very large, and the &s;eed of life was &s;et over all. But we had been troubled to get into this town, had not Pro|vidence made way for us; for the watchmen &s;tood ready to &s;top us: but there being a man riding ju&s;t before us, the watchmen que&s;tioned him fir&s;t; and perceiving he was a ju&s;tice, let him pa&s;s; and we riding clo&s;e after him, by that means e&s;caped.</P>
<P>From this place we pa&s;&s;ed to Thomas Taylor's, who had formerly been a captain, where we had a precious meeting. Hard by Thomas Taylor's lived a knight, who was much di&s;plea&s;ed when he heard I was like to be relea&s;ed out of pri&s;on; and threatened, <Q>if the king &s;et me at liberty, he would &s;end me to pri&s;on again the next day.</Q> But though I had this meeting &s;o near him, the Lord's power &s;topped him from meddling, and our meeting was quiet. Colonel Kirby al&s;o, who had been the chief means of my impri&s;on|ment
<PB N="79" REF="037441_0595_100D91FB329D9C70">at Lanca&s;ter and Scarborough ca&s;tles, when he heard I was &s;et at liberty, got another order for the taking me up; and &s;aid, <Q>He would ride his hor&s;e forty miles to take me, and would give forty pounds to have me taken.</Q> Awhile after I came &s;o near as to have a meeting within two miles of him: and then he was &s;truck with the gout, and kept his bed, &s;o that it was thought he would have died.</P>
<P>From Thomas Taylor's I vi&s;ited friends till I came to Synderhill-Green, where I had a large and general meeting. The prie&s;t of the place, hearing of it, &s;ent the con&s;table to the ju&s;tices for a warrant; and they rode their hor&s;es &s;o hard, they almo&s;t &s;poiled them: but the notice they had being &s;hort, and the way long, the meeting was ended before they came. I heard not of them till I was going out of the hou&s;e, after meeting was over; and then a friend came and told me, <Q>They were &s;earching another hou&s;e for me, the hou&s;e I was then going to.</Q> As I went along the clo&s;es towards it, I met the con&s;tables, wardens, and the ju&s;tice's clerk. I pa&s;&s;ed through them, they looking at me, and went to the hou&s;e they had been &s;earching. Thus they lo&s;t their de&s;ign; for the Lord's power bound them, and pre&s;erved me over them; and friends parted, and all e&s;caped them. The officers went away as they came; for the Lord had fru&s;trated their de&s;ign; prai&s;ed be his name for ever!</P>
<P>After this I went into Derby&s;hire, where I had a large meeting. Some friends were apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;table's coming; for they had great per&s;ecution in tho&s;e parts: but our meeting was quiet. A ju&s;tice of peace in that county had taken away much of friends goods: whereupon Ellen Fretwell had made her appeal to the &s;e&s;&s;ions, and the re&s;t of the ju&s;tices granted her her goods again, and &s;poke to that per&s;ecuting ju&s;tice, that he &s;hould not do &s;o any more. She was moved to &s;peak to that ju&s;tice, and to warn him: whereupon he bid her, 'Come and &s;it down on the bench.' 'Ay,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>if I may per&s;uade you to do ju&s;tice to the country, I will &s;it down with you.</Q> 'No,' &s;aid he, <Q>then you &s;hall not. Get out of the court.</Q> As &s;he was going. &s;he was moved of the Lord to turn again, and &s;ay, <Q>She &s;hould be there when he &s;hould not.</Q> After the &s;e&s;&s;ions, he went home and drove away her brother's oxen, for going to meetings. Then Su&s;an Frith, a friend of Che&s;terfield was moved of the Lord to tell him, <Q>If he continued in his per&s;ecuting of the innocent, the Lord would execute his
<PB N="80" REF="037441_0596_100D91FCDE85F318">plagues upon him.</Q> Soon after which he fell di&s;tracted, and died. This relation I had from Ellen Fretwell her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I travelled out of Derby&s;hire into Nottingham&s;hire, and had a large meeting at Skegby; from thence went to Mans|field, where al&s;o I had a meeting; and thence to another town, where was a fair, at which I met with many friends. Then pa&s;&s;ing through the fore&s;t in a mighty thundering and rainy day, I came to Nottingham. So great was the tem|pe&s;t, that many trees were torn up by the roots, and &s;ome people killed; but the Lord pre&s;erved us. On fir&s;t-day following I had a large meeting in Nottingham, very quiet; friends were come to &s;it under their teacher the grace of God, which brought them &s;alvation, and were e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the rock and foundation Chri&s;t Je&s;us. After meeting I went to vi&s;it the friend who had been &s;heriff about the year 1649, who&s;e pri&s;oner I then was.</P>
<P>From Nottingham I pa&s;&s;ed into Leice&s;ter&s;hire, and came to Syleby, where we had a large ble&s;&s;ed meeting. After which I went to Leice&s;ter to vi&s;it the pri&s;oners there, and then to John Penford's, where we had a general meeting, large and precious. From thence I pa&s;&s;ed, vi&s;iting friends and my relations, till I came to Warwick; where having vi&s;ited the pri&s;oners, I pa&s;&s;ed to Badgley, and had a pre|cious meeting. I travelled through Northampton&s;hire, Bed|ford&s;hire, Buckingham&s;hire, and Oxford&s;hire, vi&s;iting friends in each county. In Oxford&s;hire the devil had laid a &s;nare for me, but the Lord broke it; his power came over all, his ble&s;&s;ed truth &s;pread, and friends were increa&s;ed therein. Thus after I had pa&s;&s;ed through many counties, vi&s;iting friends, and had many large and precious meetings among&s;t them, I came to London. But I was &s;o weak with lying almo&s;t three years in cruel and hard impri&s;onments, my joints and my body were &s;o &s;tiff and benumbed, that I could hardly get upon my hor&s;e, nor bend my joints, nor well bear to be near the fire, or to eat warm meat, I had been kept &s;o long from it. Being come to London, I walk|ed a little among the ruins, and took good notice of them I &s;aw the city lying, according as the word of the Lord came to me concerning it &s;everal years before.</P>
<P>After I had been a time in London, and vi&s;ited meetings through the city, I went into the country again, and had large meetings as I went, at King&s;ton, Reading, and in Wilt&s;hire, till I came, to Bri&s;tol; where al&s;o I had many large meetings. Thomas Lower came out of Cornwall to
<PB N="81" REF="037441_0597_100D91FEF2C0EB80">meet me, and friends from &s;everal parts of the nation, it be|ing then the fair-time. After I was clear of Bri&s;tol, I went to Nath. Crips's, and through the country to London again, having large meetings in the way, and all quiet, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord. Thus, though I was very weak, I travelled up and down in the &s;ervice of the Lord, who enabled me to go through in it.</P>
<P>About this time, &s;ome who had run out from truth and cla&s;hed again&s;t friends, were reached unto by the power of the Lord, which came wonderfully over, and made them 'condemn and tear their papers of controver&s;y to pieces.' Several meetings we had with them, the Lord's everla&s;ting power was over all, and &s;et judgment on the head of that which had run out. In the&s;e meetings, which la&s;ted whole days, &s;everal who had gone out with John Perrot and others came in again, and condemned that &s;pirit which led them to <Q>keep on their hats when friends prayed, and when them&s;elves prayed.</Q> Some of them &s;aid, <Q>Friends were more righteous than they;</Q> and that, <Q>If friends had not &s;tood they had been gone and had fallen into perdition.</Q> Thus the Lord's power was wonderfully manife&s;ted, and came over all.</P>
<P>Then I was moved of the Lord to recommend the &s;etting up of five monthly meetings of men and women in the city of London, be&s;ides the women's meetings and the quarterly meetings, to take care of God's glory, and to admoni&s;h and exhort &s;uch as walked di&s;orderly or carele&s;sly, and not ac|cording to truth. For whereas friends had only quarterly meetings, now truth was &s;pread and friends grown more numerous, I was moved to recommend the &s;etting up of monthly meetings throughout the nation. And the Lord opened to me what I mu&s;t do, and how the men's and women's monthly and quarterly meetings &s;hould be ordered and e&s;tabli&s;hed in this and other nations; and that I &s;hould write to tho&s;e where I came not, to do the &s;ame. After things were well &s;ettled at London, and the Lord's truth, power, &s;eed, and life reigned and &s;hined over all in the city, I went into E&s;&s;ex. After the monthly meetings were &s;ettled in that county, I went into Suffolk and Norfolk, Thomas, Dry being with me. When we had vi&s;ited friends in tho&s;e parts, and the monthly meetings were &s;ettled, we went into Huntingdon&s;hire, where we had very large and ble&s;&s;ed meetings; and though we met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition, the Lord's power came over all, and the monthly meetings
<PB N="82" REF="037441_0598_100D9201C6C9F9E0">were e&s;tabli&s;hed there al&s;o. When we came into Bedford|&s;hire, we had great oppo&s;ition; but the Lord's power came over it all. Afterwards we went into Nottingham&s;hire, where we had many precious meetings, and the monthly meetings were &s;ettled there. Then pa&s;&s;ing into Lincoln|&s;hire, we had a meeting of &s;ome men friends of all the meet|ings in the county, at his hou&s;e who had been formerly &s;heriff of Lincoln; and all was quiet. After this meeting we pa&s;&s;ed over Trent into Nottingham&s;hire, he that had been the &s;heriff of Lincoln being with me, where we had &s;ome of all the meetings in that county together. Our meeting was glorious and peaceable, and many precious meetings we had in that county.</P>
<P>At that time William Smith was very weak and &s;ick, and the con&s;tables and others had &s;eized all his goods, to the very bed he lay upon, for truth's &s;ake. The&s;e officers threatened to break up our meeting; but the Lord's power chained them, &s;o that they had not power to meddle with us, ble&s;&s;ed be his name. After the meeting I went to vi&s;it William Smith, and there were con&s;tables and others watch|ing his corn and his bea&s;ts, that none of them might be re|moved.</P>
<P>From thence we pa&s;&s;ed into Leice&s;ter&s;hire and Warwick-&s;hire, where we had many ble&s;&s;ed meetings. The order of the go&s;pel was &s;et up, and the men's monthly meetings e&s;tabli&s;hed in all tho&s;e counties. Then we went into Der|by&s;hire, where we had &s;everal large and ble&s;&s;ed meetings. In many places we were threatened by the officers, but through the power of the Lord we e&s;caped their hands. Leaving things well &s;ettled in Derby&s;hire, we travelled over the Peak-hills (which were very cold, for it was then fro&s;t and &s;now) and came into Stafford&s;hire. At Thomas Ham|mer&s;ley's we had a general men's meeting; where things were well &s;ettled in the go&s;pel order, and the monthly meetings e&s;tabli&s;hed. I was &s;o exceeding weak, I was hardly able to get on or off my hor&s;e's back; but my &s;pirit being earne&s;tly engaged in the work the Lord had concerned me in and &s;ent me forth about, I travelled on therein, not|with&s;tanding the weakne&s;s of my body, having confidence in the Lord, that he would carry me through, as he did by his power. We came into Che&s;hire, where we had &s;everal ble&s;&s;ed meetings, and a general men's meeting; wherein all the monthly meetings for that county were &s;ettled, accord|ing to the go&s;pel order, in and by the power of God. Af|ter
<PB N="83" REF="037441_0599_100D9203563132B8">the meeting I pa&s;&s;ed away. But when the ju&s;tices heard of it, they were very much troubled that they had not come and broke it up, and taken me; but the Lord prevented them. After I had cleared my&s;elf there in the Lord's &s;er|vice, I pa&s;&s;ed into Lanca&s;hire, to William Barnes's, near Warrington, where met &s;ome of mo&s;t of the meetings in that county; and there all the monthly meetings were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the go&s;pel order. From thence I &s;ent papers into We&s;tmoreland by Leonard Fell and Robert Widders, and al&s;o into Bi&s;hoprick, Cleveland, Northumberland, Cumberland, and Scotland, to exhort friends to &s;ettle the monthly meetings in the Lord's power in tho&s;e places; which they did. So the Lord's power came over all, and the heirs of it came to inherit it. For the authority of our meetings is the power of God, the go&s;pel, which brings life and immortality to light; that all might &s;ee over the devil that darkened them, that all the heirs of the go&s;pel might walk according to the go&s;pel, and glorify God with their bodies, &s;ouls, and &s;pirits, which are the Lord's: for the or|der of the glorious go&s;pel is not of man nor by man. To this meeting in Lanca&s;hire, Margaret Fell, being a pri&s;oner, got liberty to come, and went with me from thence to Jane Milner's in Che&s;hire, where we parted. I pa&s;&s;ed into Shrop&s;hire, and from thence into Wales, and had a large general men's meeting at Charles Lloyd's, where &s;ome op|po&s;ers came in; but the Lord's power brought them down.</P>
<P>Having gone through Denbigh&s;hire and Montgomery|&s;hire, we pa&s;&s;ed into Merioneth&s;hiro, where we had &s;everal ble&s;&s;ed meetings; and then to the &s;ea-&s;ide, where we had a precious meeting. We left Wales, the monthly meetings being &s;ettled there in the power of God, and re|turned into Shrop&s;hire, where the friends of the county ga|thering together, the monthly meetings were e&s;tabli&s;hed there. Coming into Worce&s;ter&s;hire, after many meetings among&s;t friends in that county, we had a general men's meeting at Henry Gibs's, at Pa&s;hur; where al&s;o the month|ly meetings were &s;ettled in the go&s;pel order.</P>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ions being held that day in the town, &s;ome friends were concerned le&s;t they &s;hould &s;end officers to break up our meeting; but the power of the Lord re&s;trained them, &s;o that it was quiet; through which power we had domi|nion. I had &s;everal meetings among&s;t friends in that cour|ty, till I came to Worce&s;ter; and it being the fair-time, we had a precious meeting. There was then in Worce&s;ter
<PB N="84" REF="037441_0600_100D9205489576C8">one major Wild, a per&s;ecuting man; and after I was gone &s;ome of his &s;oldiers inquired after me; but having left the friends there &s;ettled in good order, we pa&s;&s;ed to Droitwich, and from thence to Shrew&s;bury, where al&s;o we had a very precious meeting. The mayor, hearing I was in town, got the re&s;t of the officers together to con&s;ult what to do again&s;t me; for they &s;aid, <Q>The great Quaker of England is come to town.</Q> But when they were come together, the Lord confounded their councils, &s;o that &s;ome were for impri&s;on|ing me, others oppo&s;ed it; and being divided among&s;t them&s;elves, I e&s;caped their hands.</P>
<P>We went into Radnor&s;hire, where we had many precious meetings, and the monthly meetings were &s;ettled in the Lord's power. As we came out of that county, &s;taying a little at a market-town, a ju&s;tice's clerk and other rude fel|lows combined together to do us a mi&s;chief upon the road. Accordingly they followed as out of town, and &s;oon over|took us; but there being many market people on the way, they were &s;omewhat hindered from doing what they intend|ed. Yet ob&s;erving two of our company ride at &s;ome di&s;|tance behind, they &s;et upon them two, and one of them drew his &s;word, and cut Richard Moor, the &s;urgeon of Shrew&s;bury. Meanwhile another of the&s;e rude fellows came galloping after me and the other friend with me; and we being to pa&s;s over a bridge, &s;omewhat of the narrowe&s;t for him to pa&s;s by us, he, in his eagerne&s;s to get before us, rode into the brook, and plunged his hor&s;e into a deep hole in the water. I &s;aw the de&s;ign, &s;topped, and de&s;ired friends to be patient, and give them no occa&s;ion. In this time came Richard Moor up to us, with the other friend, who knew the men and their names. Then we rode on, and a little further met another man on foot, much in liquor, with a naked &s;word in his hand, and not far beyond him two men and two women, one of which men had his thumb cut off by the drunken man; for being in drink he attempted rude|ne&s;s to one of the women, and this man with&s;tanding him, and re&s;cuing her, he whipped out his &s;word and cut off his thumb. This mi&s;chievous man had a hor&s;e, that, being loo&s;e, followed him a pretty way behind. I rode after the hor&s;e, caught him, and brought him to the man who had his thumb cut off; and bid him take the hor&s;e to the next ju&s;tice of peace, by which means they might find out and pur&s;ue the man that had wounded him.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion I wrote a letter to the ju&s;tices, and
<PB N="85" REF="037441_0601_100D92075E70B980">the judge of a&s;&s;ize, which was then at hand. I employed &s;ome friends to carry it to the ju&s;tices fir&s;t. The ju&s;tice, to whom the clerk belonged, rebuked him and the others al&s;o, for abu&s;ing us upon the highway; &s;o that they were glad to come and intreat friends not to appear again&s;t them at the a&s;&s;ize; which, upon their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and acknow|ledgment, was granted. This was of good &s;ervice in the country; for it &s;topped many rude people, who had been forward to abu&s;e friends.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed into Hereford&s;hire, where we had &s;everal ble&s;|&s;ed meetings. We had a general men's meeting al&s;o, where all the monthly meetings were &s;ettled. There was about this time a proclamation again&s;t meetings; and as we came through Hereford&s;hire, we were told of a great meet|ing there of the Pre&s;byterians, who had engaged them&s;elves to &s;tand, and give up all, rather than for&s;ake their meetings. When they heard of this proclamation, the people came, but the prie&s;t was gone, and left them at a lo&s;s. Then they met in Leomin&s;ter privately, and provided bread, chee&s;e, and drink, in readine&s;s, that if the officers &s;hould come, they might put up their bibles and fall to eating. The bailiff found them out, came in among them, and &s;aid, <Q>Their bread and chee&s;e &s;hould not cover them, he would have their &s;peakers.</Q> They cried, <Q>What then would become of their wives and children?</Q> But he took their &s;peakers and kept them awhile. This the bailiff told Peter Young, and &s;aid, <Q>They were the verie&s;t hypocrites that ever made a profe&s;&s;ion of religion.</Q></P>
<P>The like contrivance they had in other places. For there was one Pocock at London, that married Abigail Darcy, who was called a lady; and &s;he being convinced of truth, I went to his hou&s;e to &s;ee her. This Pocock had been one of the triers of the prie&s;ts; and, being an high Pre&s;byterian, and envious again&s;t us, he u&s;ed to call our friends hou&s;e-creepers. He being pre&s;ent, &s;he &s;aid to me, <Q>I have &s;ome|thing to &s;peak to thee again&s;t my hu&s;band.</Q> 'Nay,' &s;aid I, 'thou mu&s;t not &s;peak again&s;t thy hu&s;band.' 'Yes,' &s;aid <Q>&s;he, but I mu&s;t in this ca&s;e. The la&s;t fir&s;t-day,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>he, his prie&s;ts and people, the Pre&s;byterians, met; they had candles, tobacco-pipes, bread, chee&s;e, and cold meat on the table; and they agreed beforehand, if the officers &s;hould come in upon them, they would leave their preach|ing and praying, and fall to their cold meat.</Q> 'Oh,' &s;aid <Q>I to him, is not this a &s;hame to you who impri&s;oned us,
<PB N="86" REF="037441_0602_100D920964843C70">and &s;poiled our goods, becau&s;e we would not join you in your religion, and called us hou&s;e-creepers, that ye do not &s;tand to your own religion your&s;elves? Did ye ever find our meetings &s;tuffed with bread and chee&s;e and tobacco|pipes? Or did ye ever read in the &s;criptures of any &s;uch practice among the &s;aints?</Q> 'Why,' &s;aid the old man, 'we mu&s;t be as wi&s;e as &s;erpents.' I an&s;wered, <Q>This is the &s;erpent's wi&s;dom indeed. But who would have thought that you Pre&s;byterians and Independents, who per&s;ecuted, impri&s;oned others, &s;poiled their goods, and whipped &s;uch as would not follow your religion, &s;hould now flinch your&s;elves, and not dare to &s;tand to your own religion, but cover it with tobacco-pipes, flagons of drink, cold meat, and bread and chee&s;e!</Q> But this, and &s;uch-like de|ceitful practices, I under&s;tood afterwards, were too common among&s;t them in times of per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>After we had travelled through Hereford&s;hire, and meet|ings were well &s;ettled there, we pa&s;&s;ed into Monmouth&s;hire, where I had &s;everal ble&s;&s;ed meetings; and at Walter Jen|kins's, who had been a ju&s;tice of peace, we had a large meeting, where &s;ome were convinced: this meeting was qui|et. But to a meeting before this came the bailiff of the hundred, almo&s;t drunk, pretending he was to take up the &s;peakers. There was a mighty power of God in the meet|ing; &s;o that, although he raged, it limited him, that he could not break up the meeting. When it was over, I &s;taid awhile, and he &s;taid al&s;o. After &s;ome time I &s;poke to him, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed quietly away. At night &s;ome rude people came, and &s;hot off a mu&s;ket again&s;t the hou&s;e; but did not hurt any body. Thus the Lord's power came over all, and chained down the unruly &s;pirits, &s;o that we e&s;caped them. We came to Ro&s;s that night, and had a meeting at James Merrick's.</P>
<P>After this we came into Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, and had a gene|ral men's meeting at Nathaniel Crips's, where all the month|ly meetings were &s;ettled in the Lord's everla&s;ting power; and the heirs of &s;alvation were exhorted to take their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions in the go&s;pel, the power of God, which was and is the authority of their meetings. Many ble&s;&s;ed meetings we had in that county, before we came to Bri&s;tol. And after &s;everal powerful &s;ea&s;ons, the men's and women's meetings were &s;ettled there al&s;o.</P>
<P>As I was in bed at Bri&s;tol, the word of the Lord came to me, that I mu&s;t go back to London. Next morning
<PB N="87" REF="037441_0603_100D920B5A943AD0">Alexander Parker and &s;everal others came to me. I a&s;ked them, What they felt? They a&s;ked me, What was upon me? I told them, I felt I mu&s;t return to London. They &s;aid, the &s;ame was upon them. So we gave up to return to London; for which way the Lord moved and led us, thither we went in his power. Leaving Bri&s;tol, we pa&s;&s;ed into Wilt&s;hire, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the men's monthly meetings in the Lord's power there; and vi&s;ited friends till we came to London.</P>
<P>After we had vi&s;ited friends in the city I was moved to exhort them to bring all their marriages to the men's and women's meetings, that they might lay them before the faithful; that care might be taken to prevent &s;uch di&s;orders as had been committed by &s;ome. For many had gone to|gether in marriage contrary to their relations minds; and &s;ome young, raw people, that came among us, had mixed with the world. Widows had married without making provi&s;ion for their children by their former hu&s;bands, be|fore their &s;econd marriage. Yet I had given forth a paper concerning marriages about the year 1653, when truth was but little &s;pread, advi&s;ing friends, who might be concerned in that ca&s;e, <Q>That they might lay it before the faithful in time, before any thing was concluded; and afterwards pub|li&s;h it in the end of a meeting, or in a market, as they were moved thereto. And when all things were found clear, being free from all others, and their relations &s;atis|fied, they might appoint a meeting on purpo&s;e, for the taking of each other; in the pre&s;ence of at lea&s;t twelve faithful witne&s;&s;es.</Q> Yet the&s;e directions not being ob&s;erv|ed, and truth being now more &s;pread over the nation, it was ordered by the &s;ame power and Spirit of God, <Q>That marriages &s;hould be laid before the men's monthly and quarterly meetings, or as the meetings were then e&s;tabli&s;h|ed; that friends might &s;ee, that the relations of tho&s;e who proceeded to marriage were &s;atisfied; that the parties were clear from all others; and that widows had made provi&s;ion for their fir&s;t hu&s;band's children, before they married again; and what el&s;e was needful to be inquired into; that all things might be kept clean and pure, and be done in righte|ou&s;ne&s;s to the glory of God.</Q> Afterwards it was ordered in the wi&s;dom of God, <Q>That if either of the parties intending to marry came out of another nation, county, or monthly meeting, they &s;hould bring a certificate from the monthly meeting to which they belonged; for the &s;atisfaction of the
<PB N="88" REF="037441_0604_100D920CEBA04A08">monthly meeting before which they came to lay their in|tentions of marriage.</Q></P>
<P>After the&s;e things, with many other &s;ervices for God, were &s;et in order, and &s;ettled in the city, I pa&s;&s;ed out of London, in the leadings of the Lord's power, into Hert|ford&s;hire. After I had vi&s;ited friends there, and the men's monthly meetings were &s;ettled, I had a great meeting at Baldock of many &s;orts of people. Then returning towards London by Waltham, I advi&s;ed the &s;etting up of a &s;chool there for teaching boys; and al&s;o a women's &s;chool to be opened at Shacklewell for in&s;tructing girls and young maid|ens, in what&s;oever things were civil and u&s;eful in the crea|tion.</P>
<P>Thus, after &s;everal precious meetings in the country, I came to London again, where I &s;taid awhile in the work and &s;ervice of the Lord; and then went into Buckingham|&s;hire, where I had many precious meetings. At John Brown's of We&s;ton near Ayle&s;bury &s;ome of the men friends of each meeting being gathered together, the men's monthly meetings for that county were e&s;tabli&s;hed, in the order of the go&s;pel, the power of God; which confirmed it in all that felt it, who came thereby to &s;ee and feel-that the power of God was the authority of their meetings. I then went to Nathaniel Ball's, at North Newton near Banbury, Oxford|&s;hire, who was a friend in the mini&s;try. And there being a general meeting, where &s;ome of all the meetings were pre|&s;ent, the monthly meetings for that county were &s;ettled in the power of God; and friends were very glad of them; for they came into their &s;ervices in the church, to take care for God's glory. After this, we came into Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, vi|&s;iting friends till we came into Monmouth&s;hire, to Richard Hambery's; where meeting with &s;ome of all the meetings of that county, the monthly meetings were &s;ettled there in the Lord's power, that all in it might take care of God's glory, and admoni&s;h and exhort &s;uch as did not walk as be|came the go&s;pel. And indeed the&s;e meetings made a great reformation among&s;t people, in&s;omuch that the ju&s;tices took notice of their u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Richard Hambery and his wife accompanied us a day's journey, vi&s;iting friends, till we came to a widow's, where we lay that night. From thence we pa&s;&s;ed over the hills, vi&s;iting friends, and declaring the truth to people, till we came to another widow's, where we had a meeting. The
<PB N="89" REF="037441_0605_100D920FAE4421A8">woman could not &s;peak Engli&s;h; yet &s;he prai&s;ed the Lord for &s;ending us to vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>We travelled till we came to Swan&s;ey, where on the fir&s;t-day we had a large and precious meeting, the Lord's pre|&s;ence being eminently among&s;t us. On a week day after|wards we had a general meeting beyond Swan&s;ey, of men friends from Swan&s;ey, Tenby, Haverfordwe&s;t, and other places; and the monthly meetings were &s;ettled in the go&s;pel order, and received by friends in the power of the Lord; who&s;e truth was over all.</P>
<P>From hence we endeavoured to get over the water into Cornwall: and in order thereunto went back through Swan&s;ey to Mumbles, thinking to have got pa&s;&s;age there; but the ma&s;ter deceived us; for though he had promi&s;ed to carry us, when we came he would not. We went to ano|ther place, where was a pa&s;&s;age-boat, into which we got our hor&s;es; but &s;ome rude men in the boat (though called gen|tlemen) threatened to pi&s;tol the ma&s;ter if he took us in; who, being afraid of them, turned our hor&s;es out again; which put us out of hopes of getting over that way. Where|fore turning back into the country, we &s;taid up all night; and about the &s;econd hour in the morning took hor&s;e, and travelled till we came near Cardiff, where we &s;taid one night. The next day we came to Newport, and it being market-day there, &s;everal friends came to us, with whom we &s;at awhile; and after a fine refre&s;hing &s;ea&s;on together, we part|ed from them, and went forward.</P>
<P>Beyond this market-town we overtook a man who linger|ed on the way, as if he &s;taid for &s;omebody; but when we came up to him, he rode along with us, and a&s;ked us many que&s;tions. At length meeting with two, who &s;eemed to be pages to &s;ome great per&s;ons, he took acquaintance with them; and I heard him tell them he would &s;top us, and take us up. We rode on; and when he came to us, and would have &s;topped us, I told him. <Q>None ought to &s;top us on the king's highway, for it was as free for us as for them;</Q> and I was moved to exhort him to fear the Lord. Then he galloped away before us; and I perceived his in|tent was to &s;top us at Shipton in Wales, a garri&s;on-town, through which we were to pa&s;s. When we were come to Shipton. John-ap-John being with me, we walked down the hill into the town, leading our hor&s;es. It being mar|ket-day there, &s;everal friends met us, and would have had us to an inn. But we were not to go into any inn, &s;o we
<PB N="90" REF="037441_0606_100D92119B9F0F68">walked directly through the town over the bridge, and then were out of the limits of that town. Thus the Lord's ever|la&s;ting arm and power pre&s;erved us, and carried us over in his work and &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The next fir&s;t-day we had a large meeting in the Fore&s;t of Dean; and all was quiet. Next day we pa&s;&s;ed over the water to Old&s;tone; where after we had vi&s;ited friends, we came again to William Yeomans's, at Jubb's Court in So|mer&s;et&s;hire. From thence we went to a meeting at Po&s;&s;et, whither &s;everal friends of Bri&s;tol came to us. After which we went further into the country, and had &s;everal large meetings. The Lord's living pre&s;ence was with us, &s;up|porting and refre&s;hing us in our labour and travel in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>We came to a place near Minehead, where we had a ge|neral meeting of the men friends in Somer&s;et&s;hire. There came al&s;o a cheat, whom &s;ome friendly people would have had me to have taken along with me. I &s;aw he was a cheat; therefore bid them bring him to me, and &s;ee whether he would look me in the face. Some were ready to think I was too hard towards him, becau&s;e I would not let him go along with me; but when they brought him to me, he was not able to look me in the face, but looked hither and thi|ther; for he was indeed a cheat, and had cheated a prie&s;t, by pretending him&s;elf to be a mini&s;ter, he had got a prie&s;t's &s;uit, and went away with it.</P>
<P>After the meeting we pa&s;&s;ed to Minehead, where we tarri|ed that night. In the night I had an exerci&s;e upon me, from a &s;en&s;e I had of a dark &s;pirit working and &s;triving to get up to di&s;turb the church of Chri&s;t. Next morning I was moved to write a few lines to friends, as a warning thereof, as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LIVE in the power of the Lord God, in his Seed that is &s;et over all, and is over all trials that you may have from the dark &s;pirit, which would be owned in its actings, and thru&s;t it&s;elf among&s;t you; which is not come as yet: but in the power of the Lord God, and his Seed, keep over it, and bring it to condemnation. For I felt a kind of dark &s;pirit thru&s;ting it&s;elf up towards you, and heaving up la&s;t night; but you may keep it down with the power of God; that the witne&s;s may ari&s;e to condemn its actings, &s;o far as it hath &s;pread its dark works, before it

</LETTER>
<P>The next day &s;everal friends of Minehead accompanied us as far as Barn&s;table and Appledon in Devon&s;hire, where we had a meeting. Barn&s;table had been a bloody per&s;ecut|ing town. There were two men friends of that town, who had been a great while at &s;ea; and coming home to vi&s;it their relations (one of them having a wife and children) the mayor of the town &s;ent for them, under pretence of di&s;|cour&s;e with them; and put the oaths of allegiance and &s;upre|macy to them. Becau&s;e they could not &s;wear, he &s;ent them to Exeter gaol, where judge Archer premunired them, and kept them till one of them died in pri&s;on. When I heard of this, I was moved to write a letter to judge Archer, and another to that mayor of Barn&s;table, laying their wicked and unchri&s;tian actions upon their heads; and letting them know, that the <Q>blood of that man would be required at their hands.</Q></P>
<P>After a precious meeting at Appledon among &s;ome faith|ful friends there, we pa&s;&s;ed to Stratton, and &s;taid at an inn all night. Next day we rode to Humphrey Lower's, where we had a very precious meeting; the next day to Truro; &s;o vi&s;it|ing friends till we came to the Land's End. Then coming by the &s;outh part of that county, we vi&s;ited friends till we came to Tregangeeves, where at Loveday Hambley's we had a general meeting for all the county; in which the monthly meetings were &s;ettled in the Lord's power, and in the ble&s;&s;ed order of the go&s;pel; that all who were faithful might admo|ni&s;h and exhort &s;uch as walked not according to the go&s;pel; that the hou&s;e of God might be kept clean, righteou&s;ne&s;s might run down, and all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s be &s;wept away. Several, who had run out, were brought to condemn what they had done ami&s;s; and through repentance came in again.</P>
<P>Being clear of that county, we came into Devon&s;hire, and had a meeting among&s;t friends at Plymouth. Whence pa&s;&s;ing to Richard Brown's, we came to the widow Phi|lips's, where we had &s;ome men friends from all the meet|ings together; and there the men's monthly meetings were fettled in the heavenly order of the go&s;pel, the power of
<PB N="92" REF="037441_0608_100D7F8A0CB20000">God; which an&s;wered the witne&s;s of God in all. There was a great noi&s;e of a troop of hor&s;e coming to di&s;turb our meeting; but the Lord's power prevented it, and pre&s;erved us in peace and &s;afety.</P>
<P>After things were well &s;ettled, and the meeting done, we came to King's Bridge, and vi&s;ited friends. Then (leaving friends in tho&s;e parts well &s;ettled in the power of God) we pa&s;&s;ed to Top&s;ham and Membury, vi&s;iting friends, and hav|ing many meetings in the way, till we came to Ilche&s;ter in Somer&s;et&s;hire. Here we had a general men's meeting, and therein &s;ettled the men's monthly meetings for that county in the Lord's everla&s;ting power, the order of the go&s;pel. After the meetings were &s;ettled, and friends refre&s;hed, com|forted in the Lord's power, and e&s;tabli&s;hed upon Chri&s;t, their rock and foundation, we pa&s;&s;ed to Puddimore; where, at William Beaton's, we had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting, and all was quiet: though the con&s;tables had threatened before.</P>
<P>When we had vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings in Somer&s;et, &s;hire, we pa&s;&s;ed into Dor&s;et&s;hire to George Harris's, where we had a large men's meeting. There all the men's month|ly meeting for that county were &s;ettled in the glorious or|der of the go&s;pel; that all in the power of God might <Q>&s;eek that which was lo&s;t, bring again that which was driven away; cheri&s;h the good, and reprove the evil.</Q></P>
<P>Then we came to Southampton, where we had a large meeting on the fir&s;t-day. From thence we went to Capt, Reeves's, where the general men's meeting for Hamp&s;hire was appointed; to which &s;ome from all parts of the county came, and a ble&s;&s;ed meeting we had. The men's monthly meetings for that county were &s;ettled in the order of the go&s;pel, which had brought life and immortality to light in them.</P>
<P>But there came a rude company of Ranters, who had oppo&s;ed and di&s;turbed our meetings much. One of the women had lain with a man, who had declared it at the Market-cro&s;s, and gloried in his wickedne&s;s. A company of the&s;e lewd people lived together, at a hou&s;e hard by the place of our meeting. I went to the hou&s;e, and told them of their wickedne&s;s. The man of the hou&s;e a&s;ked, <Q>Why! did I make &s;o &s;trange of that?</Q> Another of them &s;aid, <Q>It was to &s;tumble me.</Q> I told them, <Q>Their wickedne&s;s &s;hould not &s;tumble me; for I was above it.</Q> I was mov|ed of the Lord to tell them, <Q>The plagues and judgments of God would overtake them, and come upon them.</Q> Af|terwards
<PB N="93" REF="037441_0609_100D9217F8C124F0">they went up and down the country, till at la&s;t they were ca&s;t into Winche&s;ter gaol; where the man that had lain with the woman &s;tabbed the gaoler, but not mor|tally. After they were let out of gaol, this fellow that &s;tab|bed the gaoler hanged him&s;elf. The woman al&s;o had like to have cut a child's throat, as we were informed. The&s;e people had formerly lived about London; and, when the city was fired, they prophe&s;ied, <Q>That all the re&s;t of Lon|don &s;hould be burnt within fourteen days,</Q> and ha&s;ted out of town. Though they were Ranters, great oppo&s;ers of friends, and di&s;turbers of our meetings, yet in the country, where they came, &s;ome would be apt to &s;ay they were Quakers. Wherefore I was moved of the Lord to write a paper, to be di&s;per&s;ed among&s;t the magi&s;trates and people of Hamp&s;hire, to clear friends and truth of them and their wicked actions.</P>
<P>After the men's monthly meetings in tho&s;e parts were &s;ettled, and the Lord's ble&s;&s;ed power was over all, we went to a town, where we had a meeting with friends. From thence we came to Farnham, where we me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> many friends, it being the market-day. We had precious meetings up and down that country. Friends in tho&s;e parts had for|merly been plundered, and their goods much &s;poiled, on account of tithes, and for going to meetings; but the Lord's power at this time pre&s;erved both them and us from falling into the per&s;ecutors hands.</P>
<P>We had a general men's meeting at a friend's hou&s;e in Surry; who had been plundered &s;o extremely, that he had &s;carce a cow, hor&s;e, or &s;wine left. The con&s;tables threaten|ed to come and break up our meeting; but the Lord re|&s;trained them. At this meeting the men's monthly meet|ings were &s;ettled in the authority of the heavenly power. After we had vi&s;ited friends in that county, and had many large and precious meetings, we pa&s;&s;ed to a friend's hou&s;e in Su&s;&s;ex, where the general meeting for the men friends of that county was appointed to be held; and thither came &s;e|veral from London to vi&s;it us. We had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting; and the men's monthly meetings for that county were then &s;ettled in the Lord's eternal power, the go&s;pel of &s;alvation; that all in it might keep to the order of the go&s;pel. There were at that time great threatenings of di&s;turbance; but the meeting was quiet. We had &s;everal large meetings in that county; though friends were in great &s;ufferings there, and many in pri&s;on. I was &s;ent for to vi&s;it a friend that was
<PB N="94" REF="037441_0610_100D9219EA044190">&s;ick, and went to &s;ee friends that were pri&s;oners. There was danger of my being apprehended; but I went in the faith of God's power, and thereby the Lord pre&s;erved me in &s;afety.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed into Kent; where, after we had been at &s;eve|ral meetings, we had a general one for the men friends of that county. There al&s;o the men's monthly meetings for that county were &s;ettled in the power of God, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the order of the go&s;pel, for all the heirs of it to enter into their &s;ervices and care in the church for the glory of God. Friends rejoiced in the order of the go&s;pel, and were glad of the &s;ettlement thereof.</P>
<P>After this I vi&s;ited the meetings in Kent; and when I had cleared my&s;elf of the Lord's &s;ervice in that county, I came to London. Thus were the men's monthly meetings &s;ettled through the nation; for I had been in Berk&s;hire be|fore, where mo&s;t of the ancient friends of that county were in pri&s;on; and when I had informed them of the &s;ervice of the&s;e monthly meetings, they were &s;ettled among&s;t them al|&s;o. The quarterly meetings were generally &s;ettled before. I wrote al&s;o into Ireland, Scotland, Holland, Barbadoes, and &s;everal parts of America, advi&s;ing friends to &s;ettle their men's monthly meetings in tho&s;e countries. For they had their general quarterly meetings before; but now that truth was increa&s;ed among&s;t them, they &s;hould &s;ettle monthly meetings in the power and Spirit of God which fir&s;t con|vinced them. Since the&s;e meetings have been &s;ettled, ma|ny mouths have been opened in thank&s;givings and prai&s;e, and many have ble&s;&s;ed the Lord, that he &s;ent me forth in this &s;ervice; yea, with tears have many prai&s;ed him. For all coming to have a concern and care for God's honour and glory, that his name be not bla&s;phemed, which they pro|fe&s;s; and to &s;ee that all who profe&s;s the truth, walk in the truth, in righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s, which becomes the hou&s;e of God, and that all order their conver&s;ation aright, that they may &s;ee the &s;alvation of God; all having this care upon them for God's glory, and being exerci&s;ed in his holy power and Spirit, in the order of the heavenly life and go&s;|pel of Je&s;us, they may all &s;ee and know, po&s;&s;e&s;s and partake of the government of Chri&s;t, of the increa&s;e of which there is to be no end. Thus the Lord's everla&s;ting renown and prai&s;e is &s;et up in every one's heart that is faithful; &s;o that we can &s;ay the go&s;pel order e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t us is not of man, nor by man, but of and by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in and
<PB N="95" REF="037441_0611_100D921B8BB9D0D8">through the Holy Gho&s;t. This order of the go&s;pel, which is from Chri&s;t the heavenly man, is above all the orders of men in the fall, whether Jews, Gentiles, or apo&s;tatized Chri&s;tians, and will remain when they are gone. For the power of God, which is the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, was before the devil was, and will be and remain for ever. And as the everla&s;ting go&s;pel was preached in the apo&s;tles days to all nations, that all might come into the order thereof, through the divine power, which brings life and immortality to light, that they who were heirs of it, might inherit the power and authority of it; &s;o now, &s;ince all nations have drunk the whore's cup, and all the world hath wor&s;hipped the bea&s;t (but they, who&s;e names are written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, who have wor&s;hipped God in &s;pirit and truth, as Chri&s;t commanded) the everla&s;ting go&s;|pel is to be and is preached again, as John the divine fore|&s;aw it &s;hould, to all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people. This everla&s;ting go&s;pel torments the whore, and makes her and the bea&s;t to rage, even the bea&s;t that hath power over the tongues, which are called the original, to order them, by which they make divines, as they call them. But all that receive the go&s;pel, the power of God, which brings life and immortality to light, come to &s;ee over the bea&s;t, devil, whore, and fal&s;e prophet, that darkened them and all their wor&s;hips and orders, and come to be heirs of the go&s;pel, the power of God, which was before the bea&s;t, whore, fal&s;e prophet, and devil were, and will be when they are all gone and ca&s;t into the lake of fire. And they that are heirs of this power and of this go&s;pel inherit the power which is the authority of this order, and of our meet|ings. The&s;e come to po&s;&s;e&s;s the joyful order of the joyful go&s;pel, the comfortable order of the comfortable go&s;pel, the glorious order of the glorious go&s;pel, and the everla&s;ting or|der of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, the power of God, which will la&s;t for ever, and will outla&s;t all the orders of the devil, and that which is of men or by men. The&s;e &s;hall &s;ee the government of Chri&s;t, who hath all power in heaven and earth given to him; and of the increa&s;e of his glorious, righteous, holy, ju&s;t government there is no end; but his government and his order will remain: for he who is the au|thor of it is the fir&s;t and the la&s;t, the beginning and ending the foundation of God, which over all &s;tands &s;ure; Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Amen.</P>
<P>Being returned to London, I &s;laid &s;ome time, vi&s;iting
<PB N="96" REF="037441_0612_100D921D1FE924C8">friends meetings in and about the city. While I was in London, I went one day to vi&s;it &s;quire Mar&s;h, who had &s;hewed much kindne&s;s both to me and friends. I happen|ed to go when he was at dinner. He no &s;ooner heard of my name, but he &s;ent for me up, and would have had me &s;it down with him to dinner; but I had not freedom to do &s;o. Several great per&s;ons were at dinner with him; and he &s;aid to one of them who was a great Papi&s;t, <Q>Here is a Quaker, which you have not &s;een before.</Q> The Papi&s;t a&s;ked me, 'Whether I did own the chri&s;tening of children?' I told him, 'There was no &s;cripture for any &s;uch practice.' 'What!' &s;aid he, 'not for chri&s;tening children!' I &s;aid, 'Nay.' I told him, <Q>The one bapti&s;m by the one &s;pirit into one body we owned; but to throw a little water on a child's face, and &s;ay, that was baptizing and chri&s;tening it, there was no &s;cripture for that.</Q> He a&s;ked me, <Q>Whe|ther I did own the Catholic faith?</Q> I &s;aid, 'Yes;' but added, <Q>That neither the pope nor the papi&s;ts were in the Catholic faith; for the true faith works by love, and puri|fies the heart; and if they were in that faith that gives victory, by which they might have acce&s;s to God, they would not tell the people of a purgatory after they were dead. So I undertook to prove, <Q>That neither pope nor papi&s;ts, that held a purgatory hereafter, were in the true faith.</Q> For the true, precious, divine faith, which Chri&s;t is the author of, gives victory over the devil and &s;in, that &s;eparated man and woman from God. And if they (the Papi&s;ts) were in the true faith, they would never u&s;e racks, pri&s;ons, and fines to per&s;ecute and force others to their religion, that were not of their faith. This was not the practice of the apo&s;tles and primitive Chri&s;tians, who wit|ne&s;&s;ed and enjoyed the true faith of Chri&s;t; but it was the practice of the faithle&s;s Jews and heathens &s;o to do. But,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>&s;eeing thou art a great leading man among the Papi&s;ts, and ha&s;t been taught and bred up under the pope,</Q> and &s;eeing thou &s;aye&s;t, <Q>There is no &s;alvation but in your church;</Q> I de&s;ire to know of thee, <Q>What it is that doth bring &s;alvation in your church?</Q> He an&s;wer|ed, "A good life." 'And nothing el&s;e?' &s;aid I. 'Yes,' &s;aid he, 'good works!' <Q>Is this it that brings &s;alvation in your church, a good life and good works? Is this your doctrine and principle?</Q> &s;aid I. 'Yes,' &s;aid he. <Q>Then, &s;aid I, neither thou, nor the pope, nor any of the Papi&s;ts know what it is that brings &s;alvation.</Q> He a&s;ked me,
<PB N="97" REF="037441_0613_100D921FF3F6EEC8">'What brought &s;alvation in our church?' I told him, That which brought &s;alvation to the church in the apo&s;|tles days, the &s;ame brought &s;alvation to us, and not ano|ther; namely, "The grace of God, which," the &s;cripture &s;ays, "brings &s;alvation, and hath appeared to all men," which taught the &s;aints then, and teaches us now. This grace, which brings &s;alvation, teaches, <Q>To deny ungod|line&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live godly, righteou&s;ly, and &s;oberly.</Q> So it is not the good works, nor the good life that brings &s;alvation, but the grace. 'What!' &s;aid the Papi&s;t, 'doth this grace, that brings &s;alvation, appear unto all men?' 'Yes,' &s;aid I. 'Then,' &s;aid he, 'I deny that.' I replied, 'All that deny that are &s;ect-makers, and are not in the univer&s;al faith, grace, and truth, which the apo&s;tles were in.' Then he &s;poke to me about the mo|ther-church. I told him, The &s;everal &s;ects in Chri&s;ten|dom had accu&s;ed us, and &s;aid, <Q>We for&s;ook our mother-church.</Q> The Papi&s;ts charged us with for&s;aking their church, &s;aying, "Rome was the only mother-church." The Epi&s;copalians taxed us with for&s;aking the old Prote&s;|tant religion, alleging, <Q>Theirs was the reformed mo|ther-church.</Q> The Pre&s;byterians and Independents blamed us for leaving them, each of them pretending "Theirs was the right-reformed church." But I &s;aid, if we could own any outward place to be the mother-church, we &s;hould own Jeru&s;alem, where the go&s;pel was fir&s;t preached by Chri&s;t him&s;elf and the apo&s;tles, where Chri&s;t &s;uffered, where the great conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity by Pe|ter was, where were the types, figures, and &s;hadows, which Chri&s;t ended, and where Chri&s;t commanded his <Q>di&s;ci|ples to wait until they were endued with power from on high.</Q> If any outward place de&s;erved to be called the mother, that was the place where the fir&s;t great conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity was. But the apo&s;tle faith, Gal. iv. 25, 26. <Q>Jeru&s;alem, which now is in bondage with her chil|dren; but Jeru&s;alem, which is above, is free, which is the mother of us all. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren, that beare&s;t not; break forth and cry, thou that travaile&s;t not; for the de&s;olate hath many more children than &s;he that hath an hu&s;band,</Q> ver. 27. The apo&s;tle doth not &s;ay, outward Jeru&s;alem was the mother, though the fir&s;t and great conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity was there; and there is le&s;s rea&s;on for the title [mother] to be given to Rome, or to any other outward place or city, by the chil|dren
<PB N="98" REF="037441_0614_100D9221E976DE40">of Jeru&s;alem, that is above and free: neither are they Jeru&s;alem's children that is above and free, who give the title of mother either to outward Jeru&s;alem, to Rome, or to any other place or &s;ect of people. And though this title [mother] hath been given to places and &s;ects by the degenerate Chri&s;tians, yet we &s;ay &s;till, as the apo&s;tle &s;aid of old, "Jeru&s;alem that is above, is the mother of us all." We can own no other, neither outward Jeru&s;alem, nor Rome, nor any &s;ect of people for our mother, but Jeru&s;a|lem which is above; which is free, the mother of all that are born again, become true believers in the light, and are gra&s;ted into Chri&s;t, the heavenly vine. For all who are born again of the immortal &s;eed, by the word of God which lives and abides for ever, feed upon the milk of the word, the brea&s;t of life, grow by it in life; and cannot acknowledge any other to be their mother, but Jeru&s;alem which is above.' 'Oh!' &s;aid &s;quire Mar&s;h to the Papi&s;t, You do not know this man. If he would but come to church now and then, he would be a brave man.'</P>
<P>After &s;ome other di&s;cour&s;e, I went a&s;id with ju&s;tice Mar&s;h to another room, to &s;peak with him concerning friends; for he was a ju&s;tice of peace for Middle&s;ex, and be|ing a courtier, the other ju&s;tices put much of the manage|ment of affairs upon him. He told me, <Q>He was in a &s;trait how to act between us and &s;ome other Di&s;&s;enters. For,' &s;aid he, 'You cannot &s;wear, and the Independents, Bapti&s;ts, and Fifth-monarchy-people &s;ay al&s;o, They can|not &s;wear; therefore,' &s;aid he, 'how &s;hall I di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt you and them, &s;eeing they and you all &s;ay. It is for con&s;cience-&s;ake that you cannot &s;wear?' I an&s;wered, I will &s;hew thee how to di&s;tingui&s;h. They, or mo&s;t of them, thou &s;peake&s;t of, can and do &s;wear in &s;ome ca&s;es, but we cannot &s;wear in any ca&s;e. If a man &s;hould &s;leal their cows and hor&s;es, and thou &s;houlde&s;t a&s;k them whe|ther they would &s;wear they were theirs? many of them would readily do it; but if thou try our friends, they can|not &s;wear for their own goods. Therefore, when thou put|te&s;t the oath of allegiance to any of them, a&s;k them, <Q>Whether they can &s;wear in any other ca&s;e, as for their cow or hor&s;e?</Q> Which, if they be really of us, they cannot do, though they can bear witne&s;s to the truth.</Q> I gave him a relation of a trial in Berk&s;hire, which was thus: <Q>A thief &s;tole two bea&s;ts from a friend of ours. The thief was taken and call into pri&s;on, and the friend appeared again&s;t
<PB N="99" REF="037441_0615_100D92237A8A7728">him at the a&s;&s;izes. But &s;omebody having informed the judge, that the pro&s;ecutor was a Quaker and could not &s;wear, the judge, before he heard the friend, &s;aid, <Q>Is he a Quaker? And will he not &s;wear? Then tender him the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy.</Q> So he ca&s;t the friend into pri&s;on, and premunired him, and &s;et the thief at li|berty.' Ju&s;tice Mar&s;h &s;aid, 'That judge was a wicked man. 'But,' &s;aid I, 'If we could &s;wear in any ca&s;e, we would take the oath of allegiance to the king, who is to pre|&s;erve the laws that are to &s;upport every man in his e&s;tate. Whereas others, that can &s;wear in &s;ome ca&s;es, to pre&s;erve a part of their e&s;tates if they be robbed, will not take this oath to the king, who is to pre&s;erve them in their whole e&s;tates and bodies al&s;o. So that thou maye&s;t ea&s;ily di&s;|tingui&s;h and put a difference betwixt us and tho&s;e people.</Q> Ju&s;tice Mar&s;h was afterwards very &s;erviceable to friends in this and other ca&s;es; for he kept &s;everal, both friends and others, from being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emonired: and when friends were brought before him, in time of per&s;ecution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;et many of them at liberty. When he could not avoid &s;ending to pri|&s;on, he &s;ent &s;ome for a few hours, or a night. At length he went to the king, and told him, <Q>He had &s;ent &s;ome of us to pri&s;on contrary to his con&s;cience, and he could not do &s;o any more.</Q> Therefore he removed his family from Limehou&s;e, where he lived, and took lodgings near James's Park. He told the king, <Q>If he would be plea&s;ed to give liberty of con&s;cience, that would quiet and &s;ettle all; for then none could have any pretence to be unea&s;y.</Q> And indeed he was a very &s;erviceable man to truth and friends in his day.</P>
<P>We had great &s;ervice at London this year; the Lord's truth came over all. Many who had gone out came in again this year, confe&s;ting and condemning their outgoings.</P>
<P>After I had &s;taid &s;ome time in London, I vi&s;ited friends in Surry, Su&s;&s;ex, and other places that way, and then tra|velled northward, having Leonard Fell with me. We vi|&s;ited friends till we came to Warwick, where many were in pri&s;on. We had a meeting in the town. I pa&s;&s;ed from thence to Birmingham and Badgely. At Badgely I had a large meeting. After which I pa&s;&s;ed to Nottingham, where on the fir&s;t-day we had a precious meeting, but not without danger of being apprehended; the con&s;tables having threat|ened friends.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed from thence, vi&s;iting friends, ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l I came to Bal.
<PB N="100" REF="037441_0616_100D92E63B6FE588">by, and &s;o to York quarterly-meeting. A ble&s;&s;ed meeting we had. Friends had in York&s;hire &s;even monthly meetings before, and they were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ervice of them, that they de&s;ired to have &s;even more added; for truth was much &s;pread in that county. Accordingly in that quarterly meet|ing they were &s;ettled: &s;o now they have fourteen monthly meetings.</P>
<P>It being the a&s;&s;ize-time at York, I met with ju&s;tice Ho|tham, a well-wi&s;her to friends, who had been tender and very kind to me from the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>After I had fini&s;hed my &s;ervice in York, I pa&s;&s;ed into the country. As I went, a great burden fell upon me; but I did not pre&s;ently know the rea&s;on of it. I came to a meeting on fir&s;t-day at Richard Shipton's, which was very large. There being a meeting the &s;ame day at another place, and the prie&s;t of that place, being mi&s;informed that I was to be there, got a warrant, and made great di&s;turbance at that meeting; of which I&s;aac Lindley gave me an account by the following letter:</P>

<P>WHEN thou went'&s;t from York, the fir&s;t-day after thou wa&s;t at Richard Shipton's, that day I had ap|pointed a meeting ten miles from York, where there had not been a meeting before. But the prie&s;t and the con&s;table got a warrant on the &s;eventh-day, and put thy name only in the warrant; for they had heard thou wa&s;t to be there. They came with weapons and &s;taves, and cried, <Q>Where is Mr. Fox?</Q> over and over; many friends being there, they concluded thou wa&s;t among them. But tho&s;e raveners, being di&s;appointed, plucked me down, abu&s;ed me, beat &s;ome friends, and then took me before a magi&s;trate; but he &s;et me at liberty.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I then vi&s;ited friends at Whitby and Scarborough. When I was at Scarborough, the governor, hearing I was come, &s;ent to invite me to his hou&s;e, &s;aying, <Q>Surely, I would not be &s;o unkind, as not to come and &s;ee him and his wife.</Q> After the meeting I went to vi&s;it him, and he received me very courteou&s;ly and lovingly.</P>
<P>Having vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings in York&s;hire, the Woulds, and Holderne&s;s, I came to Henry Jack&s;on's, where
<PB N="101" REF="037441_0617_100D7F9C8094DD60">I had a great meeting. From thence to Thomas Taylor's, and to John Moor's at Eldreth, where we had a very large meeting: the Lord's power and pre&s;ence was eminently among&s;t us. Not far from this place lay colonel Kirby, lame of the gout, who had threatened, <Q>If ever I came near, he would &s;end me to pri&s;on again; and had bid forty pounds to any man that could take me,</Q> as I was credibly informed.</P>
<P>After this I came into Stafford&s;hire and Che&s;hire, where we had many large and precious meetings. I had a very large one at William Barns's, about two miles from War|rington; and though colonel Kirby was now got abroad again, as violent in breaking up meetings as before, and was then at Warrington, the Lord did not &s;uffer him to come to this meeting: &s;o we were pre&s;erved out of his hands.</P>
<P>Now was I moved of the Lord to go over into Ireland, to vi&s;it the &s;eed of God in that nation. There went with me Robert Lodge, James Lanca&s;ter, Thomas Briggs, and John Stubbs. We waited near Liverpool for &s;hipping and wind. After we had waited &s;ome days, we &s;ent James Lan|ca&s;ter, who took pa&s;&s;age, and brought word the &s;hip was ready, and would take us in at Black-rock. We went thi|ther on foot. It being pretty fair and the weather very hot, I was much &s;pent with walking. When we arrived the &s;hip was not there, &s;o we were o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ged to go to the town and take &s;hipping. When we were get on board, I &s;aid to the re&s;t of the company, <Q>Come, ye will triumph in the Lord; for we &s;hall have fair wind and weather.</Q> There were many pa&s;&s;engers in the &s;hip &s;ick, but not one of our company. The ma&s;ter and many of the pa&s;&s;engers were very loving; and being at &s;ea on a fir&s;t-day, I was moved to declare truth among them: whereupon the ma&s;ter &s;aid to the pa&s;&s;engers, <Q>Come, here are things that you never heard in your lives.</Q> When we came before Dublin, we took boat, and went a&s;hore; and the earth and air &s;melt, me|thought, with the corruption of the nation, &s;o that it yielded another &s;mell to me than England did; which I imputed to the popi&s;h ma&s;&s;acres that had been committed, and the blood that had been &s;pilt in it, from which a foulne&s;s a&s;|cended. We pa&s;&s;ed through among the officers of the cu&s;|toms four times, yet they did not &s;earch us; for they per|ceived what we were. Some of them were &s;o envious, they did not care to look at us. We did not pre&s;ently &s;ind friends; but went to an inn, and &s;ent to inquire for &s;ome,
<PB N="102" REF="037441_0618_100D7FAA5ED58248">who were exceeding glad of our coming, and received us with great joy. We &s;taid there the weekly meeting, which was a large one, and the power and life of God appeared greatly in it. Afterwards we pa&s;&s;ed to a province-meeting, which la&s;ted two days, there being both a men's meeting about the poor, and another more general, in which a migh|ty power of the Lord appeared. Truth was livingly de|clared, and friends were much refre&s;hed therein.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing from thence about twenty-four miles, we came to another place, where we had a very good refre&s;hing meet|ing; after which &s;ome Papi&s;ts were angry, and raged very much. When I heard of it, I &s;ent for one of them, a &s;choolma&s;ter; but he would not come. Whereupon I &s;ent a challenge to him, with all the friars, monks, prie&s;ts, and je&s;uits, to come forth, and <Q>try their God and their Chri&s;t, which they made of bread and wine;</Q> but no an|&s;wer could I get from them. Wherefore I told them, <Q>They were wor&s;e than the prie&s;ts of Baal; for Baal's prie&s;ts tried their wooden god, but the&s;e dur&s;t not try their god of bread and wine; and Baal's prie&s;ts and people did not eat their god, as the&s;e did, and then make another.</Q></P>
<P>We went on to New-garden, where was a great meeting. From thence we travelled to Bandon-bridge and the Land's-end, having many meetings as we went; in which the mighty power of the Lord was manife&s;ted, friends were well refre&s;hed, and many people were affected with the truth. At Bandon, the mayor's wife, being convinced, de|&s;ired her hu&s;band to come to the meeting; but he bid her for her life &s;he &s;hould not make known that I was at a meeting there.</P>
<P>He that was then mayor of Cork, being very envious again&s;t truth and friends, had many friends in pri&s;on; and knowing I was in the country, he &s;ent four warrants to take me; therefore friends were de&s;irous that I might not ride through Cork. But being at Bandon, there appeared to me in a vi&s;ion, <Q>A very ugly-vi&s;aged man, of a black and dark look. My &s;pirit &s;truck at him in the power of God, and it &s;eemed to me that I rode over him with my hor&s;e, and my hor&s;e &s;et his &s;oot on the &s;ide of his face.</Q> When I came down in the morning, I told a friend, the command of the Lord was to me to ride through Cork; but bid him tell no man. So we took hor&s;e, many friends be|ing with me. When we came near the town, friends would have &s;hewed me a way on the back&s;ide of it; but I told
<PB N="103" REF="037441_0619_100D92256E903A20">them, my way was through the &s;treets. Taking Paul Mor|rice to guide me through the town, I rode on; and as we rode through the market-place, and by the mayor's door, he, &s;eeing me, &s;aid, 'There goes George Fox;' but he had not power to &s;top me. When we had pa&s;&s;ed through the centinels, and were come over the bridge, we went to a friend's hou&s;e, and alighted. There the friends told me, what a rage was in the town, and how many warrants were granted to take me. While I was &s;itting there with friends, I felt the evil &s;pirit at work in the town, &s;tirring up mi&s;|chief again&s;t me; and I felt the power of the Lord &s;trike at that evil &s;pirit. By-and-by &s;ome other friends coming in, told me, <Q>It was over the town, and among&s;t the magi&s;|trates, that I was in the town.</Q> I &s;aid, <Q>Let the devil do his wor&s;t,</Q> After awhile that friends were refre&s;hed one in another, and we travellers had refre&s;hed our&s;elves, I call|ed for my hor&s;e, and having a friend to guide me, we went on our way. But great was the rage that the mayor and others of Cork were in, that they had mi&s;&s;ed me, and great pains they afterwards took to have taken me, having their &s;couts abroad upon the roads, as I under&s;tood, to ob&s;erve which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, I went. Afterwards, &s;carce a public meeting I came to, but &s;pies came to watch if I was there. And the envious magi&s;trates and prie&s;ts &s;ent informations one to another concerning me, de&s;cribing me by my hair, hat, cloaths, and hor&s;e; &s;o that when I was near an hundred miles from Cork they had an account concerning me, and de&s;cription of me, before I came among&s;t them. One very envious magi&s;trate, who was both a prie&s;t and a ju&s;tice, got a warrant from the judge of a&s;&s;ize to apprehend me; the warrant was to go over all his circuit, which reached near an hundred miles. Yet the Lord di&s;appointed all their councils, defeated all their de&s;igns again&s;t me, and by his good hand of Providence pre&s;erved me out of all their &s;nares, and gave us many &s;weet and ble&s;&s;ed opportunities to vi&s;it friends, and &s;pread truth through that nation. For meetings were very large, friends coming to them far and near; and other people flocking in. The powerful pre|&s;ence of the Lord was preciou&s;ly felt with and among&s;t us; whereby many of the world were reached, convinced, ga|thered to the truth, and the Lord's flock was increa&s;ed; and friends were greatly refre&s;hed and comforted in feeling the love of God. Oh! the brokenne&s;s that was among&s;t them in the flowings of life! So that, in the power and Spirit
<PB N="104" REF="037441_0620_100D922724C4B070">of the Lord, many together broke out into &s;inging, even with audible voices, making melody in their hearts.</P>
<P>At which time I was moved to declare to friends there in the mini&s;try, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>SOUND, &s;ound abroad, you faithful &s;ervants of the Lord, witne&s;&s;es in his name, faithful &s;ervants, pro|phets of the Highe&s;t, and angels of the Lord!

For the dead have long heard the dead, the blind have long wan|dered among the blind, and the deaf among&s;t the deaf. Therefore &s;ound, ye &s;ervants, prophets, and angels of the Lord, ye trumpets of the Lord, that you may awaken the dead, awaken them that are a&s;leep in their graves of &s;in, death, and hell, &s;ea and earth, and who lie in the tombs. Sound abroad, ye trumpets, and rai&s;e up the dead, that they may hear the voice of the Son of God, the voice of the Second Adam that never fell, the voice of the Light, the voice of the Life, the voice of the Power, the voice of the Truth, the voice of the Righteous, and the voice of the Ju&s;t. Sound ye the trumpets, the melodious &s;ound abroad, that all the deaf ears may be opened to hear the plea&s;ant &s;ound of the trumpet to judgment and life, to con|demnation and light. Sound your trumpets all abroad, you angels of the Lord, &s;ons and daughters, prophets of the Highe&s;t, that all that are dead and a&s;leep in the graves, who have been long dreaming and &s;lumbering, may be awakened and hear the voice of the Lamb, who have long heard the voice of the bea&s;t, that now they may hear the voice of the Bridegroom, the voice of the Bride, the voice of the Great Prophet, the voice of the Great King, the voice of the Great Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of their &s;ouls. Sound it all abroad, ye trumpets, among the dead in Adam; for Chri&s;t is come, the &s;econd Adam, that they might have life, yea have it abundantly. Awaken the dead, awaken the &s;lumberers, awaken the dreamers, awaken them that are a&s;leep, awaken them out of their graves, out of their tombs, out of their &s;epulchres, out of the &s;eas! Sound abroad, ye trumpets, that awaken the dead, that they may all hear the &s;ound of it in the graves, and they that hear may live and come to the Life, that is, the Son of God. He is ri&s;en from the dead, the grave could not
<PB N="105" REF="037441_0621_100D9229D7E60AC0">hold nor contain him, neither could all the watchers of the earth, with all their guards, keep him therein. Sound, ye trumpets of the Lord, to all the &s;eekers of the living among the dead, that he is ri&s;en from the dead; to all the &s;eekers of the living among the dead, and in the graves that the watchers keep; he is not in the grave, he is ri&s;en; and there is that under the grave of the watchers of the out|ward grave, which mu&s;t be awakened and come to hear his voice, who is ri&s;en from the dead, that they might come to live. Therefore &s;ound abroad, you trumpets of the Lord, that the grave might give up her dead, and hell and the &s;ea might give up their dead; and all might come forth to judgment, to the judgment of the Lord before his throne, and have their &s;entence and reward according to their works.</P>
<P>Away with all the chaff and the hu&s;ks, and contentions and &s;trife, that the &s;wine feed upon in the mire, and in the fall; and the keepers of them of Adam and Eve's hou&s;e in the fall; that lies in the mire, out of light and life.</P>

<P>To James Hutchin&s;on's in Ireland came many great per|&s;ons, de&s;iring to di&s;cour&s;e with me about Election and Re|probation. I told them, <Q>Though they judged our prin|ciple fooli&s;h, it was too high for them, they could not with their wi&s;dom comprehend it; therefore I would di&s;cour&s;e, with them according to their capacities. You &s;ay,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>that God hath ordained the greate&s;t part of men for hell, and that they were ordained &s;o before the world began; for which your proof is in Jude. You &s;ay, E&s;au was reprobated, and the Egyptians, and the &s;tock of Ham. But Chri&s;t &s;aith to his di&s;ciples, "Go, teach all nations;" and, <Q>Go into all nations, and preach the go&s;pel of life and &s;alva|tion.</Q> If they were to go to all nations, were they not to go to Ham's &s;tock, and E&s;au's &s;tock? Did not Chri&s;t die for all? Then for the &s;tock of Ham, of E&s;au, and the Egyptians. Doth not the &s;cripture &s;ay, <Q>God would have all men to be &s;aved?</Q> Mark, "All men;" then the &s;tock of E&s;au, and of Ham al&s;o. Doth not God &s;ay, "Egypt my people?" and that he would have an altar in Egypt? I&s;a. xix. Were there not many Chri&s;tians for|merly in Egypt? And doth not hi&s;tory &s;ay, that the bi|&s;hop of Alexandria would formerly have been pope? And
<PB N="106" REF="037441_0622_100D922B68F99BD8">had not God a church in Babylon? I confe&s;s, <Q>The word come to Jacob, and the &s;tatutes to I&s;rael; the like was not to other nations.</Q> For the law of God was given to I&s;rael; but the go&s;pel was to be preached to all nations, and is to be preached. The go&s;pel of peace and glad-tid|ings to all nations. <Q>He that believes is &s;aved, but he that doth not believe is condemned already;</Q> &s;o the con|demnation comes through unbelief. And whereas Jude &s;peaks of &s;ome that were of old ordained (or written of be|fore) to condemnation, he doth not &s;ay, before the world began; but, "written of old;" which may be referred to Mo&s;es's writings, who wrote of tho&s;e whom Jude men|tions, namely Cain, Corah, Balaam, and the angels that kept not their fir&s;t e&s;tate; and &s;uch Chri&s;tians as followed them in their way, and apo&s;tatized from the fir&s;t &s;tate of Chri&s;tianity, were and are ordained for condemnation by the light and truth, which they are gone from. And though the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of God's loving Jacob and hating E&s;au, yet he tells the believers, <Q>We all were by nature children of wrath, as well as others.</Q> This includes the &s;tock of Jacob, of which the apo&s;tle him&s;elf and all believ|ing Jews were. Thus both Jews and Gentiles were all concluded under &s;in, and &s;o under condemnation, that God might have mercy upon all through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The election and choice &s;tands in Chri&s;t: <Q>and he that believes is &s;aved, and he that believes not is condemned already.</Q> Jacob typifies the &s;econd birth, which God loved; and both Jews and Gentiles mu&s;t be born again, before they can enter the kingdom of God. When you are born again, ye will know election and reprobation; for the election &s;tands in Chri&s;t, the &s;eed, before the world began; but the reprobation lies in the evil &s;eed &s;ince the word began.</Q> After this manner, but &s;omewhat more largely, I di&s;cour&s;ed with tho&s;e great per&s;ons about this mat|ter, and they confe&s;&s;ed they had never heard &s;o much be|fore.</P>
<P>After I had travelled over Ireland, and vi&s;ited friends in their meetings, as well for bu&s;ine&s;s as wor&s;hip, and an&s;wer|ed &s;everal papers and writings from monks, friars, and Pro|te&s;tant prie&s;ts (for they all were in a rage again&s;t us, and endeavoured to &s;top the work of the Lord, and &s;ome Je&s;uits &s;wore in &s;ome of our hearing, that we came to &s;pread our principles in that nation, but we &s;hould not do it) I return|ed to Dublin, in order to take pa&s;&s;age for England. When
<PB N="107" REF="037441_0623_100D922D5CF36468">I had &s;taid the fir&s;t-day's meeting there, which was very large and precious, there being a &s;hip ready, and the wind &s;erving, we took our leave of friends; parting in much ten|derne&s;s and brokenne&s;s, in the &s;en&s;e of the heavenly life and power, manife&s;ted among&s;t us. Having put our hor&s;es and nece&s;&s;aries on board in the morning, we went our&s;elves in the afternoon, many friends accompanying us to the &s;hip; and divers friends and friendly people followed us in boats, when we were near a league at &s;ea, their love drawing them, though not without danger. A good, weighty, and true people there is in that nation, &s;en&s;ible of the power of the Lord God, tender of his truth, and very good order they have in their meetings; for they &s;tand up for righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s, which dams up the way of wickedne&s;s. A precious vi&s;itation they had, and there is an excellent &s;pirit in them, worthy to be vi&s;ited. Many things more I could write of that nation, and of my travels in it, which would be large to mention particularly; but thus much I thought good to &s;ignify, that the righteous may rejoice in the pro&s;|perity of truth.</P>
<P>James Lanca&s;ter, Robert Lodge, and Thomas Briggs came back with me; John Stubbs, having further &s;ervice there, &s;taid behind. We were two nights at &s;ea; in one of which a mighty &s;torm aro&s;e that put the ve&s;&s;el in great danger; but I &s;aw the power of God went over the winds and &s;torms, he had them in his hand, and his power bound them. And the &s;ame power of the Lord God, which carri|ed us over, brought us back again; and in his life gave us dominion over all the evil &s;pirits that oppo&s;ed us there.</P>
<P>We landed at Liverpool, and went to Richard John|&s;on's, William Barnes's, and to William Gandy's, vi&s;iting friends, and having many precious meetings in Lanca&s;hire and Che&s;hire. We came into Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, and met with a report at Nail&s;worth, which was &s;pread in that coun|try, <Q>That George Fox was turned Pre&s;byterian, that a pulpit was prepared for him and &s;et in a yard, and that there would be a thou&s;and people there the next day to hear him.</Q> I thought it &s;trange that &s;uch a report &s;hould be rai&s;ed of me; yet as we went further from one friend's hou&s;e to another, we met with the &s;ame. We pa&s;&s;ed by the yard where the pulpit was, and &s;aw it, and went to the place where friends meeting was to be next day, where we &s;taid that night. Next day, being the fir&s;t-day, we had a
<PB N="108" REF="037441_0624_100D922FCB0AF720">very large meeting, and the Lord's power and pre&s;ence was among&s;t us.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of this &s;trange report (as I was informed) was this. There was one John Fox, a Pre&s;byterian prie&s;t, who u&s;ed to go about preaching; and &s;ome, changing his name from John to George, gave out that George Fox was turned from a Quaker to be a Pre&s;byterian, and would preach at &s;uch a place &s;uch a day. This begat &s;uch curio&s;ity in the people, that they went thither to hear this Quaker turned Pre&s;byterian, who would not have gone to have heard John Fox him&s;elf. By this means it was reported they had go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> together above a thou&s;and people. But when they came there, and perceived they had a trick put upon them, that he was but a counterfeit George Fox, and under&s;tood that the real George Fox was hard by, &s;everal hundreds came to our meeting and were &s;ober and attentive. <Q>I directed them to the grace of God in them&s;elves, which would teach them, and bring them &s;alvation.</Q> When the meet|ing was over, &s;ome of the people &s;aid, <Q>They like George Fox the Quaker's preaching better than George Fox the Pre&s;byterian's.</Q> Thus, by my providential coming into tho&s;e parts at that time, this fal&s;e report was di&s;covered, and &s;hame came over the contrivers of it.</P>
<P>Not long after this John Fox was complained of in the hou&s;e of commons, for <Q>having a tumultuous meeting, in which trea&s;onable words were &s;poken:</Q> which (according to the be&s;t information I could get) was thus. John Fox had formerly been prie&s;t of Mansfield in Wilt&s;hire; and, being put out of that place, was afterwards permitted by a Common-prayer prie&s;t to preach &s;ometimes in his &s;teeple|hou&s;e. At length this Pre&s;byterian prie&s;t, pre&s;uming too far upon the pari&s;h prie&s;t's former grant, began to be more bold than welcome, and attempted to preach there whether the pari&s;h prie&s;t would or no. This cau&s;ed a great bu&s;tle and conte&s;t in the &s;teeple-hou&s;e between the two prie&s;ts, and their hearers on either &s;ide; in which conte&s;t the Common|prayer-book was cut to pieces, and &s;ome trea&s;onable words &s;poken by &s;ome of the followers of John Fox. This was quickly put in the news, and &s;ome malicious Pre&s;byterians can&s;ed it to be &s;o worded as if it had proceeded from George Fox the Quaker, though I was above two hundred miles from the place when this bu&s;tle happened. When I heard of it. I &s;oon procured certificates from &s;ome of the members of the hou&s;e of commons, who knew this man, and gave it
<PB N="109" REF="037441_0625_100D9231BADF7110">under their hands, that it was J. Fox, who had formerly been par&s;on of Mansfield in Wilt&s;hire, that was complained of to the hou&s;e of commons, to be the chief ringleader in that unlawful a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>And indeed this John Fox di&s;covered him&s;elf to be an ill man, for &s;ome who had been his followers came to be convinced of truth, and thereupon left him; upon which he came to &s;ome of their hou&s;es to talk with them; and they telling him, <Q>He was in the &s;teps of the fal&s;e prophets, preaching for hire and filthy lucre, like tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t cried wo again&s;t, and the apo&s;tles declared again&s;t, &s;uch as &s;erved not the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t but their own bellies, and telling him, Chri&s;t &s;aid, Freely ye have received, freely give, and therefore he &s;hould not take money of people for preaching, e&s;pecially now time were &s;o hard;</Q> he replied, <Q>God ble&s;s preaching, that brings in money, let times go how they will. Fill my belly with good victuals; then call me fal&s;e prophet, or what you will, and kick me about the hou&s;e when ye have done, if ye will.</Q> This re|lation I had from a man and his wife, who had been for|merly his hearers, and whom John Fox (with others) cau&s;|ed deeply to &s;uffer. For he, and &s;ome other Pre&s;byterian prie&s;ts, re&s;orting to a widow woman's, who had the impro|priation, and took the tithes of the pari&s;h, &s;he told them, <Q>There was a Quaker in that pari&s;h that would not pay her tithes;</Q> and a&s;ked, what &s;he &s;hould do with him. They advi&s;ed her, <Q>To &s;end workmen to cut down and carry away his corn:</Q> which &s;he did, and thereby impove|ri&s;hed the man. But to proceed.&mdash;</P>
<P>After this meeting in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, we travelled till we came to Bri&s;tol; where I met with Margaret Fell, who was come to vi&s;it her daughter Yeomans. I had &s;een from the Lord a con&s;iderable time before, that I &s;hould take Marga|ret Fell to be my wife; and when I fir&s;t mentioned it to her, &s;he felt the an&s;wer of Life from God thereunto. But though the Lord had opened this thing to me, yet I had not received a command from him for the accompli&s;hing of it then. Wherefore I let the thing re&s;t, and went on in the work and &s;ervice of the Lord, according as he led me; tra|velling in this nation, and through Ireland. But now be|ing at Bri&s;tol, and finding Margaret Fell there, it opened in me from the Lord that the thing &s;hould be accompli&s;hed. After we had di&s;cour&s;ed the matter together, I told her, <Q>If &s;he al&s;o was &s;atisfied with the accompli&s;hing of it now,
<PB N="110" REF="037441_0626_100D92334D311EF8">&s;he &s;hould fir&s;t &s;end for her children:</Q> which &s;he did. When the re&s;t of her daughters were come. I a&s;ked both them and her &s;ons-in-law, <Q>If they had any thing again&s;t it, or for it?</Q> and they all &s;everally expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction therewith. Then I a&s;ked Margaret, <Q>If &s;he had fulfilled her hu&s;band's will to her children?</Q> She replied, <Q>The children knew &s;he had.</Q> Whereupon I a&s;ked them, <Q>Whether, if their mother married, they &s;hould not lo&s;e by it?</Q> I a&s;ked Margaret, <Q>Whether &s;he had done any thing in lieu of it, which might an&s;wer it to the children?</Q> The children &s;aid, <Q>She had an&s;wered it to them, and de&s;ired me to &s;peak no more of it.</Q> I told them, <Q>I was plain, and would have all things done plainly: for I &s;ought not any outward advantage to my&s;elf.</Q> So our intention of marriage was laid before friends both privately and publick|ly, to their full &s;atisfaction, many of whom gave te&s;timony that it was of God. Afterwards, a meeting being appoint|ed on purpo&s;e for the accompli&s;hing thereof, in the publick meeting-hou&s;e at Broad Mead in Bri&s;tol, we took each other in marriage; the Lord joining us together in the ho|nourable marriage, in the everla&s;ting covenant and immor|tal Seed of life. In the &s;en&s;e whereof, living and weighty te&s;timonies were borne thereunto by friends in the movings of the heavenly power, which united us together. Then was a certificate, relating both the proceedings and the mar|riage, openly read, and &s;igned by the relations, and by mo&s;t of the ancient friends of that city; be&s;ides many others from divers parts of the nation.</P>
<P>We &s;taid about a week in Bri&s;tol, and then went toge|ther to Old&s;tone: where, taking leave of each other in the Lord, we parted, betaking our&s;elves each to our &s;everal &s;er|vice; Margaret returning homewards to the north, and I pa&s;&s;ing on in the work of the Lord as before. I travelled through Wilt&s;hire, Berk&s;hire, Oxford&s;hire, Buckingham|&s;hire, and &s;o to London, vi&s;iting friends: in all which counties I had many large and precious meetings.</P>
<P>Being in London, it came upon me to write to friends throughout the nation, about <Q>putting out poor children to trades.</Q> Wherefore I &s;ent the following epi&s;tle to the quarterly meetings of friends in all the counties.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LET every quarterly meeting make inquiry through all the monthly and other meetings, to know all friends
<PB N="111" REF="037441_0627_100D9234DE84AEE0">that are widows, or others, that have children fit to put out to apprentice&s;hips; &s;o that once a quarter you may &s;et forth an apprentice from your quarterly meeting; &s;o you may &s;et forth four in a year, in each county, or more, if there be occa&s;ion. This apprentice, when out of his time, may help his father or mother, and &s;upport the family that is decayed; and, in &s;o doing, all may come to live comfortably. This being done in your quarterly meet|ings, ye will have knowledge through the county, in the monthly and particular meetings, of ma&s;ters fit for them; and of &s;uch trades as their parents or you de&s;ire, or the children are mo&s;t inclinable to. Thus being placed out to friends, they may be trained up in truth; and by this means in the wi&s;dom of God, you may pre&s;erve friends children in the truth, and enable them to be a &s;trength and help to their families, and nur&s;ers and pre&s;ervers of their relations in their ancient days. Thus al&s;o, things being ordered in the wi&s;dom of God, you will take off a continual maintenance, and free your&s;elves from much cumber. For in the country, ye know, ye may &s;et forth an apprentice for a little to &s;everal trades, as brick|layers, ma&s;ons, carpenters, wheelwrights, ploughwrights, taylors, tanners, curriers, black&s;miths, &s;hoemakers, nail|ers, butchers, weavers of linen and woollen, &s;tuffs and &s;erges, &amp;c. And you may do well to have a &s;tock in your quarterly meetings for that purpo&s;e. All that is given by any friends at their decea&s;e (except it be given to &s;ome particular u&s;e, per&s;on, or meeting) may be brought to the publick &s;tock for that purpo&s;e. This will be a way for the pre&s;erving of many that are poor among you; and it will be a way of making up poor families. In &s;everal counties it is practi&s;ed already. Some quarterly meetings &s;et forth two apprentices; and &s;ometimes the children of others that are laid on the pari&s;h. You may bind them for fewer or more years, according to their capacities. In all things the wi&s;dom of God will teach you; by which ye may help the children of poor friends, that they may come to &s;upport their families, and pre&s;erve them in the fear of God. So no more, but my love in the everla&s;ting Seed, by which ye will have wi&s;dom to order all things to the glory of God.</P>

I &s;taid not long in London; but having vi&s;ited friends, and finding things there quiet and well, the Lord's power being over all, I pa&s;&s;ed into E&s;&s;ex and Hertford&s;hire, where I had many precious meetings. Intending to go as far as Leice&s;ter&s;hire, I wrote a letter to my wife, to acquaint her therewith; that, if &s;he found it convenient, &s;he might meet me there. From Hertford&s;hire I turned into Cam|bridge&s;hire; thence into Huntingdon&s;hire, and &s;o into Lei|ce&s;ter&s;hire; where, in&s;tead, of meeting my wife, I heard &s;he was haled out of her hou&s;e to Lanca&s;ter pri&s;on, by an order got from the king and council, to fetch her back to pri&s;on upon the old premunire; though &s;he had been di&s;|charged from that impri&s;onment by an order from the king and council the year before. Wherefore, having vi&s;ited friends as far as Leice&s;ter&s;hire, I returned by Derby&s;hire and Warwick&s;hire to London; having had many large and ble&s;|&s;ed meetings in the &s;everal counties I pa&s;&s;ed through, and been &s;weetly refre&s;hed among&s;t friends in my travels.</P>

This was &s;omewhat difficult, but by diligent attendance they at length obtained it; the king giving command to Sir John Otway to &s;ignify his plea&s;ure therein by letter to the &s;heriff, and others concerned in the country.

<P>O FRIENDS, con&s;ider this act, which limits our meetings to five. Is this, to do as ye would be done by?' Would ye be &s;o &s;erved your&s;elves?

<P>MY dear friends, Keep in the faith of God above all outward things and in his power, that hath given you dominion over all.

<P>On the next fir&s;t-day after the act came in force, I went to the meeting-hou&s;e at Gracechurch-&s;treet, where I expect|ed the &s;torm was mo&s;t likely to begin. When I came there, I found the &s;treet full of people, and a guard &s;et to keep friends out of their meeting-hou&s;e. I went to the other pa&s;|&s;age, out of Lombard-&s;treet, where al&s;o I found a guard; but the court was full of people, and a friend was &s;peaking among&s;t them: but &s;poke not long. When he had done, I &s;tood up, and was moved to &s;ay, <Q>Saul, Saul, why per|&s;ecute&s;t thou me? It is hard for thee to kick again&s;t that which pricks thee. Then I &s;hewed, it is Saul's nature that per&s;ecute&s;t &s;till; and that they, who per&s;ecute Chri&s;t in his members now, where he is made manife&s;t, kick again&s;t that which pricks them. That it was the birth of the fle&s;h that per&s;ecuted the birth born of the Spirit; and that it was the nature of dogs to tear and devour the &s;heep; but that we &s;uffered as &s;heep that bite not again; for we were a peaceable people, and loved them that per&s;ecuted us.</Q> After I had &s;poken awhile to this effect, the con&s;table came with an informer and &s;oldiers; and as they plucked me down, I &s;aid, 'Ble&s;&s;ed are the peace-makers.' The com|mander of the &s;oldiers put me among the &s;oldiers, and bid them &s;ecure me, &s;aying to me, <Q>You are the man I looked for.</Q> They took al&s;o John Burneyate, with another friend, and had us away fir&s;t to the Exchange, and after|wards towards Moorfields. As we went along the &s;treets the people were very moderate. Some of them laughed at the con&s;table, and told him, 'We would not run away.' The informer went with us unknown; till falling into di&s;|cour&s;e with one of the company, he &s;aid, <Q>It would never be a good world till all people came to the good old reli|gion that was too hundred years ago.</Q> Whereupon I a&s;k|ed him, <Q>Art thou a Papi&s;t? What! a Papi&s;t informer? for two hundred years ago there was no other religion but that of the Papi&s;ts.</Q> He &s;aw he had en&s;nared him&s;elf, and was vexed at it; for as he went along the &s;treets, I &s;poke often to him, and manife&s;ted what he was. When we were come to the mayor's hou&s;e, and were in the court-yard, &s;e|veral
<PB N="116" REF="037441_0632_100D923E93202610">a&s;ked me, 'How and for what I was taken?' ... I de&s;ir|ed them to a&s;k the informer; and al&s;o know what his name was: but he refu&s;ed to tell his name. Whereupon one of the mayor's officers looking out at a window, told him, <Q>He &s;hould tell his name before he went away: for the lord mayor would know by what authority he intruded him&s;elf with &s;oldiers into the execution of tho&s;e laws which belonged to the civil magi&s;trate to execute, and not to the military. After this, he was eager to be gone; and went to the porter to be let out. One of the officers called to him, &s;aying. Have you brought people here to inform again&s;t, and now will you go away before my lord mayor comes?</Q> Some called to the porter not to let him out; whereupon he forci|bly pulled open the door and &s;lipped out. No &s;ooner was he come into the &s;treet but the people gave a &s;hout, that made the &s;treet ring again, crying out, <Q>A Papi&s;t informer! A Papi&s;t informer!</Q> We de&s;ired the con&s;table and &s;oldiers to go and re&s;cue him out of the people's hands, le&s;t they &s;hould do him a mi&s;chief. They went, and brought him into the mayor's entry, where we &s;taid awhile: but when he went out again, the people received him with &s;uch ano|ther &s;hout. Whereupon the &s;oldiers were obliged to re&s;cue him once more; and then they had him into an hou&s;e in an alley, where they per&s;uaded him to change his perriwig, &s;o he got away unknown.</P>
<P>When the mayor came, we were brought into the room where he was, and &s;ome of his officers would have taken off our hats; which he perceiving, bid them, <Q>let us alone, and not meddle with our hats; for,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>they are not yet brought before me in judicature.</Q> So we &s;tood by, while he examined &s;ome Pre&s;byterian and Bapti&s;t teachers; with whom he was &s;omewhat &s;harp, and convicted them. After he had done with them, I was brought to the table where he &s;at; and then the officers took off my hat. The mayor &s;aid mildly to me, <Q>Mr. Fox, you are an eminent man among&s;t tho&s;e of your profe&s;&s;ion; pray, will you be in&s;trumental to di&s;&s;uade them from meeting in &s;uch great numbers? for, &s;eeing Chri&s;t hath promi&s;ed, that where two or three are met in his name, he will be in the mid&s;t of them; and the king and parliament are graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to allow of four to meet together to wor&s;hip God; why will not you be content to partake both of Chri&s;t's promi&s;e to two or three and the king's indulgence to four?</Q> I an&s;wered to this pur|po&s;e: <Q>Chri&s;t's promi&s;e was not to di&s;courage many from
<PB N="117" REF="037441_0633_100D9241374425C8">meeting together in his name; but to encourage the few, that the fewe&s;t might not forbear to meet, becau&s;e of their fewne&s;s. But if Chri&s;t hath promi&s;ed to manife&s;t his pre|&s;ence in the mid&s;t of &s;o &s;mall an a&s;&s;embly, where but two or three were gathered in his name, how much more would his pre&s;ence abound, where two or three hundred are ga|thered in his name? I wi&s;hed him to con&s;ider whether this act would not have taken hold of Chri&s;t, with his twelve apo&s;tles and &s;eventy di&s;ciples (if it had been in their time) who u&s;ed to meet often together, and that in great numbers? However, I told him this act did not concern us; for it was made again&s;t &s;editious meetings, of &s;uch as met, under colour and pretence of religion, to contrive in|&s;urrections, as (the act &s;ays) late experience had &s;hewn; but we had been &s;ufficiently tried and proved, and always found peaceable; therefore he &s;hould do well to put a dif|ference between the innocent and the guilty.</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>The act was made again&s;t meetings, and a wor&s;hip not ac|cording to the liturgy.</Q> I told him, <Q>[According to] was not the very &s;ame thing; and a&s;ked him, whether the li|turgy was according to the &s;criptures? And whether we might not read &s;criptures, and &s;peak &s;criptures? He &s;aid, Yes. I told him, This act took hold only of &s;uch as met to plot and contrive in&s;urrections, as late experience had &s;hewn; but they had never experienced that by us. Be|cau&s;e thieves are &s;ometimes on the road, mu&s;t not hone&s;t men travel? And becau&s;e plotters and contrivers have met to do mi&s;chief, mu&s;t not an hone&s;t, peaceable people meet to do good? If we had been a people that met to plot and contrive in&s;urrections, &amp;c. we might have drawn our&s;elves into fours; for four might do more mi&s;chief in plotting than if there were four hundred, becau&s;e four might &s;peak out their minds more freely to one another than four hun|dred could. Therefore we being innocent, and not the people this act concerns, we keep our meetings as we u&s;ed to do; and I &s;aid, I believed that he knew in his con&s;ci|ence we were innocent.</Q> After &s;ome more di&s;cour&s;e he took our names, and the places where we lodged, and at length, as the informer was gone, &s;et us at liberty.</P>
<P>Being at liberty, the friends with me a&s;ked, <Q>Whi|ther I would go?</Q> I told them, <Q>To Gracechurch-&s;treet meeting again, if it was not over.</Q> When we came there, the people were generally gone; only &s;ome few &s;tood at the gate. We went into Gerrard Roberts's. From thence
<PB N="118" REF="037441_0634_100D9242C9D97430">I &s;ent to know how the other meetings in the city were? And under&s;tood, that at &s;ome of the meeting-places friends were kept out; at others they were taken, but &s;et at liberty again a few days after. A glorious time it was; for the Lord's power came over all, and his everla&s;ting truth got renown. For as fa&s;t as &s;ome, that were &s;peaking, were ta|ken down, others were moved of the Lord of &s;tand up and &s;peak, to the admiration of the people; and the more, be|cau&s;e many Bapti&s;ts and other &s;ectaries left their publick meetings, and came to &s;ee how the Quakers would &s;tand. As for the informer afore&s;aid, he was &s;o frighted, that there dur&s;t hardly any informer appear publickly again in Lon|don for &s;ome time after. But the mayor, who&s;e name was Samuel Starling, though he carried him&s;elf &s;moothly towards us, proved afterwards a very great per&s;ecutor of our friends, many of whom he ca&s;t into pri&s;on, as may be &s;een in the trials of W. Penn, W. Mead, and others at the Old Bailey this year.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time the heat of per&s;ecution in the city be|gan to abate, and meetings were quieter there. I being then clear of the city, went to vi&s;it friends in the country; and attended &s;everal meetings in Middle&s;ex, Buckingham|&s;hire, and Oxford&s;hire, which were quiet, though in &s;ome places there was much threatening. At Reading mo&s;t of the friends were in pri&s;on; and I went to vi&s;it them. When I had been awhile with them, the friends that were pri&s;oners gathered together, and &s;everal other per&s;ons came in; &s;o I had a fine opportunity among&s;t them, and <Q>declared the word of life, encouraging them in the truth; and they were refre&s;hed in feeling the pre&s;ence and power of the Lord among&s;t them.</Q> When the meeting was ended, the gaoler under&s;tanding I was there, friends were concerned how to get me &s;afe out again; for they feared he &s;hould &s;top me. After I had &s;taid awhile, and eat with them, I went down &s;tairs, and the gaoler being at the door, I put my hand in my pocket, which he had &s;uch an eye to, hoping to get &s;omething of me, that he a&s;ked me no que&s;tion. So I gave him &s;omething, and bad him <Q>be kind and civil to my friends in pri&s;on, whom I came to vi&s;it;</Q> and he let me pa&s;s out without interruption. But &s;oon after I&s;aac Penington coming to vi&s;it them, he &s;topped him, and cau&s;ed him to be made a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Next morning I rode to a meeting at Baghur&s;t in Hamp|&s;hire, Thomas Briggs being with me. When we came into
<PB N="119" REF="037441_0635_100D92445BFD7B48">the pari&s;h, &s;ome &s;ober people told us, <Q>the prie&s;t of the town was an envious man, and did threaten us.</Q> We went to the meeting, which was large, and after &s;ome time Thomas Briggs &s;tood up and &s;poke. It &s;eems the prie&s;t had got a warrant, and &s;ent the con&s;tables and other officers with it. They came to the hou&s;e, &s;taid awhile, and then went away, but did not come into the meeting; &s;o we in the meeting did not know of their being there. After Tho|mas Briggs had done &s;peaking, I was moved of the Lord to &s;tand up, and declare the word of life to the people; and a precious meeting we had. When the meeting was ended and ri&s;en, I heard a great clutter in the yard; and when we came out, the man of the hou&s;e told us, <Q>The officers had been in the hou&s;e before, and did not come into the meet|ing, but went away without doing any thing. And that now the prie&s;t in a great rage had &s;ent them again, and his own &s;ervant with them.</Q> But the meeting being ended before they came, they could do nothing. Thus the good providence of the Lord pre&s;erved us from the wicked de|&s;ign of the envious prie&s;t.</P>
<P>From thence we went to a friend's on the edge of Berk&s;hire, where &s;everal friends came to vi&s;it us. Afterwards we pa&s;&s;ed into Surry, and had many precious meetings, till we came to Stephen Smith's near Guildford, where great per&s;ecution had been; and much goods had been taken away from friends for their meetings, and under great threatenings they were at that time; yet we had &s;everal ble&s;&s;ed meetings there|abouts; and the Lord's power was over all, in and by which we were pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>We went into Su&s;&s;ex, by Richard Baxe's, where we had a large, precious, quiet meeting, though the con&s;tables had given out threatenings before. I had many more meetings in that county; and though there were &s;ome threatenings, meetings were peaceable; and friends refre&s;hed, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed upon the foundation of God that &s;tands &s;ure. When I had thoroughly vi&s;ited Su&s;&s;ex, I went into Kent, and had many glorious and precious meetings in &s;everal parts of that county. I went to a meeting near Deal, which was very large; and returning from thence to Can|terbury, vi&s;ited friends there; then pa&s;&s;ed into the I&s;le of Sheppy, where I &s;taid two or three days: and thither came Alexander Parker, George Whitehead, and John Rou&s;e.</P>
<P>The next day, finding my &s;ervice for the Lord fini&s;hed there, we pa&s;&s;ed towards Roche&s;ter. As I was walking
<PB N="120" REF="037441_0636_100D924756E023E0">down a hill, a great weight and oppre&s;&s;ion fell upon my &s;pirit. I got on my hor&s;e again; but the weight remained &s;o, that I was hardly able to ride. At length we came to Roche&s;ter, but I was much &s;pent, being &s;o extremely loaden and burden|ed with the world's &s;pirits, that my life was oppre&s;&s;ed under them. I got with difficulty to Grave&s;end, and lay at an inn there; but could hardly either eat or &s;leep. The next day John Rou&s;e and Alexander Parker went for London. John Stubbs and I went over the Ferry into E&s;&s;ex. We came to Horn-church, where was a meeting on the fir&s;t-day. Af|ter the meeting I rode with great unea&s;ine&s;s to Stratford, to a friend's who&s;e name was Williams; he had formerly been a captain. Here I lay exceeding weak, and at la&s;t lo&s;t both hearing and &s;ight. Several friends came to me from Lon|don. I told them, <Q>I &s;hould be as a &s;ign to &s;uch as would not &s;ee, and &s;uch as would not hear the truth.</Q> In this condition I continued a pretty while. Several came about me; and though I could not &s;ee their per&s;ons, I felt and di&s;cerned their &s;pirits, who of them was hone&s;t-hearted, and who was not. Divers friends, who practi&s;ed phy&s;ick, would have given me medicines, but I was not to meddle with any; for I was &s;en&s;ible I had a travail to go through; and therefore de&s;ired none but &s;olid, weighty friends might be about me. Under great &s;ufferings, &s;orrows, and oppre&s;&s;ions I lay for &s;everal weeks; whereby I was brought &s;o low and weak in body, that few thought I could live. Some of tho&s;e with me went away, &s;aying, 'They would not &s;ee me die;' and it was reported both in London and in the country that I was decea&s;ed; but I felt the Lord's power inwardly &s;upporting me. When tho&s;e about me had given me up to die, I &s;poke to them to get a coach to carry me to Ger|rard Roberts's, about twelve miles off; for I found it was my place to go thither. I had now recovered a little glim|mering &s;ight, &s;o that I could di&s;cern the people and fields as I went, and that was all. When I came to Gerrard's, he was very weak. I was moved to &s;peak to him, and en|courage him. After I had &s;taid about three weeks there, it was with me to go to Enfield. Friends were afraid of my removing; but I told them I might &s;afely go. When I had taken my leave of Gerrard, and was come to Enfield, I went fir&s;t to vi&s;it Amor Stoddart, who lay very weak, and almo&s;t &s;peechle&s;s. I was moved to tell him, <Q>He had been faithful as a man, and faithful to God; and that the im|mortal Seed of life was his crown.</Q> Many more words I
<PB N="121" REF="037441_0637_100D924948319860">was moved to &s;peak to him; though I was then &s;o weak, I was hardly able to &s;tand; and within a few days after Amor died. I went to the widow Dry's at Enfield, where I lay all that winter; warring in &s;pirit with the evil &s;pirits of the world, that warred again&s;t truth and friends. For there were great per&s;ecutions at this time. Some meeting-hou&s;es were pulled down, and many were broken up by &s;oldiers. Sometimes a troop of hor&s;e or a company of foot came; and &s;ome broke their &s;words, carbines, mu&s;kets, and pikes with beating friends. Many they wounded, &s;o that their blood lay in the &s;treets. Among&s;t others, that were active in this cruel per&s;ecution at London, my old adver&s;ary colonel Kir|by was one; who, with a company of foot, went to break up &s;everal meetings; and would often inquire for me at the meetings he broke up. One time, as he went over the water to Hor&s;lydown, there happening &s;ome &s;cuffle between &s;ome of his &s;oldiers and &s;ome of the watermen, he bid his men 'Fire at them;' which they did, and killed &s;ome.</P>
<P>I was under great &s;ufferings at this time, beyond what I have words to declare. For I was brought into the deep, and &s;aw all the religions of the world, and people that lived in them, and the prie&s;ts that held them up; who were as a company of men-eaters, eating up the people like bread, and gnawing the fle&s;h from off their bones. But as for true religion and wor&s;hip, and mini&s;ters of God, alack! I &s;aw there was none among&s;t tho&s;e of the world that pretended to it. For they that pretended to be the church, were but a company of men-eaters, men of cruel vi&s;ages, and of long teeth; who, though they had cried again&s;t the men-eaters in America, I &s;aw they were in the &s;ame nature. And as the great profe&s;&s;ing Jews did 'eat up God's people like bread,' and the fal&s;e prophets and prie&s;ts then preached peace to people, &s;o long as they <Q>put into their mouths and fed them;</Q> but if they fed them not, they prepared war again&s;t them; <Q>they ate their fle&s;h off their bones, and chopped them for the caldron;</Q> &s;o the&s;e that profe&s;s them&s;elves chri&s;tians now (both prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors) and are not in the &s;ame power and Spirit that Chri&s;t and the holy prophets and apo&s;tles were in, are in the &s;ame nature that the old pro|fe&s;&s;ing Jews were in, and are men-eaters as well as they. The&s;e &s;tirred up per&s;ecution, and &s;et the wicked informers on work; &s;o that a friend could hardly &s;peak a few words in a private family, before they &s;at down to cat, but &s;ome
<PB N="122" REF="037441_0638_100D924AD86E0358">were ready to inform again&s;t them. A particular in&s;tance of which I have heard, as followeth:
At Droitwich, J. Cartwright came to a friend's hou&s;e; and being moved of the Lord to &s;peak a few words before he &s;at down to &s;upper, there came an informer, and &s;tood heark|ening under the window. When he had heard the friend &s;peak, hoping to get &s;ome gain to him&s;elf, he went and in|formed; and go: a warrant to di&s;train the friend's goods, under pretence that there was a meeting at his hou&s;e: whereas there was none in the hou&s;e at that time but the friend, the man of the hou&s;e, his wife, and their maid-&s;er|vant. But this evil-minded man, as he came back with his warrant in the night, fell off his hor&s;e, and broke his neck. So there was a wretched end of a wicked informer, who hop|ed to have enriched him&s;elf by &s;poiling friends; but the Lord prevented him, and cut him off in his wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Though it was a cruel, bloody, per&s;ecuting time, yet the Lord's power went over all, his everla&s;ting Seed prevailed; and friends were made to &s;tand firm and faithful in the Lord's power. Some &s;ober people of other profe&s;&s;ions would &s;ay, <Q>If friends did not &s;tand, the nation would run into de|bauchery.</Q></P>
<P>Though by rea&s;on of my weakne&s;s I could not travel, among&s;t friends as I u&s;ed to do; yet in the motion of life I &s;ent the following lines, as an encouraging te&s;timony to them:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Seed is above all. In it walk; in which ye all have life. Be not amazed at the weather; for always the ju&s;t &s;uffered by the unju&s;t, but the ju&s;t had the domi|nion.

Therefore keep on the mountain of holine&s;s, ye who are led to it by the light, where nothing &s;hall hurt.

<P>After &s;ome time it plea&s;ed the Lord to allay the heat of this violent per&s;ecution; and I felt in &s;pirit an overcoming of the &s;pirits of tho&s;e men-eaters that had &s;tirred it up, and carried it on to that height of cruelty, though I was out|wardly very weak. I plainly felt, and tho&s;e friends that were with me, and that came to vi&s;it me, took notice, that, as the per&s;ecution cea&s;ed, I came from under the travails and &s;ufferings which had laid with &s;uch weight upon me: &s;o that towards the &s;pring I began to recover, and to walk up and down, beyond the expectation of many; who did not think I could ever have gone abroad again.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was under this &s;piritual &s;uffering, the &s;tate of the New Jeru&s;alem, which comes down out of heaven, was opened to me; which &s;ome carnal-minded people had look|ed upon to be like an outward city, dropped out of the elements. I &s;aw the beauty and glory of it, the length, the breadth, and the height thereof, all in complete proportion. I &s;aw that all, who are within the light of Chri&s;t, in his faith, which he is the author of, in the Spirit, the Holy Gho&s;t, which Chri&s;t, the holy Prophets and Apo&s;tles were in, and within the grace, truth, and power of God, which are the walls of the city, &s;uch are within the city, are members of this city, and have right to eat of the tree of life, which yields her fruit every month, and who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ves are for the healing of the nations. But they that are out of the grace, truth, light, Spirit and power of God, &s;uch as re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, quench, vex, and grieve the Spirit of God, who hate the Light, turn from the grace of God into wantonne&s;s, and do de&s;pite to the Spirit of Grace, &s;uch as have erred from the faith, made &s;hipwreck of it and of a good con&s;cience, who abu&s;e the power of God, and de&s;pi&s;e prophe&s;ying, revelation, and in&s;piration, the&s;e are the dogs and unbelievers that are without the city. The&s;e make up the great city Babylon, confu&s;ion, and her cage, the power of darkne&s;s; and the evil &s;pirit of error &s;urrounds and covers them over. In this great city Babylon are the fal&s;e prophets, in the fal&s;e power and fal&s;e &s;pirit; the bea&s;t in the dragon's power, and the whore that is gone a whor|ing from the Spirit of God, and nom Chri&s;t her hu&s;band. But the Lord's power is over all this power of darkne&s;s, cage,
<PB N="124" REF="037441_0640_100D924F7656A8E8">whore, bea&s;t, dragon, fal&s;e prophets and their wor&s;hippers, who are for the lake which burns with fire. Many things more did I &s;ee concerning the heavenly city, the New Jeru&s;alem, which are hard to be uttered, and would be hard to be received. But, in &s;hort, this holy city is with|in the light; and all that are within the light are within the city; the gates whereof &s;tand open all the day (for there is no night there) that all may come in. Chri&s;t's blood being &s;hed for every man, he ta&s;ted death for every man, and en|lighteneth every man that cometh into the world; and his grace, that brings &s;alvation, having appeared to all men, there is no place or language where his voice may not be heard. The chri&s;tians in the primitive times were called by Chri&s;t 'A city &s;et upon an hill;' they were al&s;o called 'The light of the world,' and, 'The &s;alt of the earth;' but when chri&s;tians lo&s;t the light, &s;alt, and power of God, they came to be trodden under foot, like un&s;avoury &s;alt. Even as the Jews, who while they kept the law of God were pre&s;erved above all nations, but when they turned their backs on God and his law they were trodden under foot of other nations; &s;o Adam and Eve, while they obeyed God, were kept in his image and in the paradi&s;e of God, in dominion over all the works of his hands; but when they di&s;obeyed God, they lo&s;t the image of God, the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and the holine&s;s in which they were made; they lo&s;t their dominion, were driven out of paradi&s;e, fell under the dark power of Satan, and came under the chains of darkne&s;s. But the promi&s;e of God was, <Q>That the Seed of the woman. Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head,</Q> &s;hould break his power and authority, which had led into captivity, and had held man therein. So Chri&s;t, who is the fir&s;t and la&s;t, &s;ets man free, and is the re&s;urrec|tion of the ju&s;t and unju&s;t, the Judge of quick and dead; and they that are in him are inve&s;ted with everla&s;ting re&s;t and peace, out of all the labours, travails, and mi&s;eries of Adam in the fall. So he is &s;ufficient and of ability to re|&s;tore man up into the &s;tate that he was in before he fell; and not into that &s;tate only, but up into that &s;tate al&s;o that never fell, even to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I had al&s;o in this time a great exerci&s;e and travail of &s;pi|rit upon me, concerning the powers and rulers of the&s;e na|tions, from the &s;en&s;e I had of the many tender vi&s;itations and faithful warnings given them, and of their great abu&s;e thereof, who had refu&s;ed to hear, and rejected the coun&s;el of
<PB N="125" REF="037441_0641_100D9251966AD4A0">the Lord. And though I knew friends would be clear of their blood, yet I could not but mourn over them, and give forth the&s;e few lines concerning them:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>WE have given them a vi&s;itation, have faithfully warned them, have declared to them our inno|cency and uprightne&s;s, and that we never did any hurt to the king, nor to any of his people. We have nothing in our hearts but love and good-will to him and his people, and de&s;ire their eternal welfare. But if they will not hear, the day of judgment, &s;orrow, torment, mi&s;ery, and &s;ud|den de&s;truction will come from the Lord upon them, that have been the cau&s;e of the &s;ufferings of many thou|&s;ands of &s;imple, innocent, harmle&s;s people, that have done them no hurt, nor have had any ill-will towards him or them; but have de&s;ired their eternal good, for the eternal truth's &s;ake. De&s;truction will come upon them that turn the &s;word backward. Therefore do not blind your eyes, the Lord will bring &s;wi&s;t de&s;truction and mi&s;ery upon you. Surely he will do it, and relieve his innocent peo|ple, who have groaned for deliverance from under your oppre&s;&s;ion, and have al&s;o groaned for your deliverance out of wickedne&s;s. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God, that he hath a people in this nation that &s;eek the good of all men upon the face of the earth; for we have the mind of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that de&s;ires not the death of a &s;inner, but the &s;alvation and good of all. Ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord our God for ever!</P>

<P>While I continued at Enfield, a &s;en&s;e came upon me of an hurt, that &s;ometimes happened by per&s;ons coming under the profe&s;&s;ion of truth out of one country into another, to take an hu&s;band or wife among&s;t friends, where they were &s;trangers, and it was not known whether they were clear and orderly or no. And it opened in me to recommend the following method to friends, for preventing &s;uch incon|veniencies.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL friends that marry, whether men or women, if they come out of another nation, i&s;land, plantation, or county, let them bring a certificate from the men's meeting of that county, nation, i&s;land, or plantation from which they come, to the men's meeting where they pro|po&s;e
<PB N="126" REF="037441_0642_100D92532885FA48">their intention of marriage. For the men's meeting being made up of the faithful, this will &s;top all bad and raw &s;pirits from roving up and down. When any come with a certificate or letter of recommendation from one men's meeting to another, one is refre&s;hed by another, and can &s;et their hands and hearts to the thing. This will prevent a great deal of trouble. And then, when ye have to &s;ay to them in the power of God, in admoni&s;hing and in&s;tructing them, ye are left to the power and Spirit of God to do it, and to let them know the duty of mar|riage, and what it is; that there may be unity and con|cord in the Spirit, and power, light, and wi&s;dom of God, throughout all the men's meetings in the whole world, in one, in the life. Let copies of this be &s;ent to every coun|ty, nation, and i&s;land, where friends are, that all things may be kept holy, pure, and righteous, in unity and peace, and God over all may be glorified among you, his lot, his people, and inheritance, his adopted &s;ons and daughters, and heirs of his life. So no more, but my love in that which changeth not.</P>

<P>When I had recovered, &s;o that I could walk a little up and down, I went from Enfield to Gerrard Roberts's again, and from thence to the women's &s;chool at Shacklewell, and &s;o to the meeting at Gracechurch-&s;treet, London; where, though I was yet but weak, the Lord's power upheld and enabled me to declare his eternal word of life.</P>
<P>About this time I was moved to pray to the Lord, as followeth:</P>

<P>O LORD God Almighty! pro&s;per Truth, and pre|&s;erve ju&s;tice and equity in the land! Bring down all inju&s;tice, iniquity, oppre&s;&s;ion, fal&s;ehood, cruelty, and unmercifulne&s;s in the land, that mercy and righteou&s;ne&s;s may flouri&s;h!</P>

<P>I mentioned before, that, upon notice received of my wife's being had to pri&s;on again, I &s;ent two of her daugh|ters to the king, and they procured his order to the &s;heriff of Lanca&s;hire for her di&s;charge. But though I expected &s;he would have been &s;et at liberty, yet this violent &s;torm of per&s;ecution coming &s;uddenly on, the per&s;ecutors there found means to hold her &s;till in pri&s;on. But now the per&s;ecution a little cea&s;ing, I was moved to &s;peak to Martha Fi&s;her, and another woman friend, to go to the king about her liberty. They went in the faith, and in the Lord's power; and he gave them favour with the king, &s;o that he granted a di&s;charge under the broad &s;eal, to clear both her and her e&s;tate after &s;he had been ten years a pri&s;oner, and premu|nired; the like whereof was &s;carce to be heard in England. I &s;ent down the di&s;charge forthwith by a friend; by whom al&s;o I wrote to her, to inform her how to get it delivered to the ju&s;tices, and al&s;o to acquaint her, that it was upon me from the Lord to go beyond &s;ea, to vi&s;it the plantations in America, and therefore de&s;ired her to ha&s;ten to London, as &s;oon as &s;he could conveniently after &s;he had obtained her liberty, becau&s;e the &s;hip was then fitting for the voyage. In the meantime I got to King&s;ton, and &s;taid at John Rous's till my wife came up, and then began to prepare for the voyage. But the yearly meeting being near at hand, I tarried till that was over. Many friends came up to it from all parts of the nation, and a very large and precious meet|ing it was; for the Lord's power was over all, and his glo|rious, everla&s;tingly-renowned &s;eed of life was exalted above all.</P>
<P>After this meeting was over, and I had fini&s;hed my &s;er|vices for the Lord in England, the &s;hip, and the friends that
<PB N="128" REF="037441_0644_100D925657B48EC8">intended to go with me, being ready, I went to Grave&s;end the 12th of the 6th month. The friends that were bound for the voyage with me went down to the &s;hip the night before. Their names were, Thomas Briggs, William Ed|mund&s;on, John Rou&s;e, John Stubbs, Solomon Eccles, James Lanca&s;ter, John Cartwright, Robert Widders, George Patti&s;on, John Hull, Elizabeth Hooton, and Elizabeth Mi|ers. The ve&s;&s;el we were to go in was a yacht, called the Indu&s;try, the ma&s;ter's name Thomas For&s;ter, and the num|ber of pa&s;&s;engers about fifty. I lay that night on board; but mo&s;t of the friends lay at Grave&s;end. Early next morning, the pa&s;&s;engers, and tho&s;e friends that intended to accompany us to the Downs, being come on board, we took our leave in great tenderne&s;s of tho&s;e that came with us to Grave&s;end only, and &s;et &s;ail about &s;ix in the morning for the Downs. Having a fair wind, we out&s;ailed all the &s;hips that were outward-bound, and got thither by the even|ing. Some of us went a&s;hore that night, and lodged at Deal; where we under&s;tood an officer had orders from the governor to take our names in writing, which he did the next morning, though we told him they had been taken at Grave&s;end. In the afternoon, the wind &s;erving, I took leave of my wife and the other friends, and went on board. Before we could &s;et &s;ail, there being two of the king's fri|gates riding in the Downs, the captain of one of them &s;ent his pre&s;s-ma&s;ter on board us, who took three of our &s;eamen. This had certainly delayed, if not wholly prevented our voyage, had not the captain of the other frigate, being in|formed of the leakine&s;s of our ve&s;&s;el, and the length of our voyage, in compa&s;&s;ion and much civility, &s;pared us two of his men. Before this was over, an officer of the cu&s;tom|hou&s;e came on board to peru&s;e packets and get fees, &s;o that we were kept from &s;ailing till about &s;un-&s;et; during which &s;top, a very con&s;iderable number of merchantmen, outward|bound, were got &s;everal leagues before us. Being clear we &s;et &s;ail in the evening, and by next morning overtook part of that fleet about the height of Dover. We &s;oon reached the re&s;t, and in a little time left them all behind us; for our yatch was counted a very &s;wift &s;ailer. But &s;he was very leaky, &s;o that the &s;eamen and &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;engers did for the mo&s;t part pump day and night. One day they ob&s;erved that in two hours time &s;he &s;ucked in &s;ixteen inches of water in the well.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="037441_0645_100D92597A1FB708">
When we had been about three weeks at &s;ea, one after|noon we &s;pied a ve&s;&s;el about four leagues a&s;tern of us. Our ma&s;ter &s;aid, It was a Sallee man of war who &s;eemed to give us chace. Our ma&s;ter &s;aid, <Q>Come, let us go to &s;upper, and when it grows dark, we &s;hall lo&s;e him.</Q> This he &s;poke to pacify the pa&s;&s;engers, &s;ome of whom began to be very apprehen&s;ive of the danger. But friends were well &s;a|tisfied, having faith in God, and no fear upon their &s;pirits. When the &s;un was down, I &s;aw the &s;hip out of my cabin making towards us. When it grew dark, we altered our cour&s;e to mi&s;s her; but &s;he altered al&s;o, and gained upon us. At night the ma&s;ter and others came into my cabin, and a&s;ked me, 'What they &s;hould do?' I told them, <Q>I was no mariner;</Q> and a&s;ked them, <Q>What they thought was be&s;t to do?</Q> They &s;aid, <Q>There were but two ways, either to out-run him, or tack about and hold the &s;ame cour&s;e we were going before.</Q> I told them, <Q>If he were a thief, they might be &s;ure he would tack about too; and as for out-running him, it was to no purpo&s;e to talk of that, for they &s;aw he &s;ailed fa&s;ter than we.</Q> They a&s;ked me again, 'What they &s;hould do?' 'For,' they &s;aid, <Q>if the mariners had taken Paul's coun&s;el, they had not come to the damage they did.</Q> I an&s;wered, <Q>It was a tria of faith, therefore the Lord was to be waited on for coun&s;el.</Q> So retiring in &s;pirit, the Lord &s;hewed me, <Q>That his life and power was placed between us and the &s;hip that pur&s;ued us.</Q> I told this to the ma&s;ter and the re&s;t, and that the be&s;t way was to tack about and &s;teer our right cour&s;e. I wi&s;hed them al&s;o to put out all their candles, but that they &s;teered by, and to &s;peak to all the pa&s;&s;engers to be &s;till and quiet. About the 11th hour in the night the watch called, and &s;aid, 'They were ju&s;t upon us.' That di&s;quieted &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;engers; whereupon I &s;at up in my cabin, and looking through the port-hole, the moon being not quite down, I &s;aw them very near us. I was getting up to go out of the cabin; but remembering the word of the Lord, 'That his life and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er was placed between us and them,' I lay down again. The ma&s;ter and &s;ome of the &s;eamen came again, and a&s;ked me, <Q>If they might not &s;teer &s;uch a point?</Q> I told them, 'They might do as they would.' By this time the moon was gone quite down, a fre&s;h gale aro&s;e, and the Lord hid us from them; and we &s;ailed bri&s;kly on, and &s;aw them no more. The next day, being the fir&s;t day of the week, we had a publick meeting in the &s;hip, as
<PB N="130" REF="037441_0646_100D925B0D9ABA20">we u&s;ually had on that day throughout the voyage, and the Lord's pre&s;ence was greatly among us. I de&s;ired the peo|ple, <Q>To mind the mercies of the Lord, who had delivered them; for they might have been all in the Turks hands by that time, had not the Lord's hand &s;aved them.</Q> About a week after, the ma&s;ter and &s;ome of the &s;eamen endeavoured to per&s;uade the pa&s;&s;engers, it was not a Turki&s;h pirate that cha&s;ed us, but a merchant-man going to the Canaries. When I heard of it, I a&s;ked them, <Q>Why then did they &s;peak &s;o to me? Why did they trouble the pa&s;&s;engers? And why did they tack about from him, and alter their cour&s;e?</Q> I told them, <Q>They &s;hould take heed of &s;light|ing the mercies of God.</Q></P>
<P>Afterwards, while we were at Barbadoes, came in a mer|chant from Sallee, and told the people, <Q>That one of the Sallee men of war &s;aw a mon&s;trous yacht at &s;ea, the greate&s;t that ever he &s;aw, had her in chace, and was ju&s;t upon her; but there was a Spirit in her that he could not take.</Q> This confirmed us in the belief, that it was a Sallee-man we &s;aw make after us; and that it was the Lord that delivered us out of his hands.</P>
<P>I was not &s;ea-&s;ick during the voyage, as many of the friends and other pa&s;&s;engers were; but the many hurts and brui&s;es I had formerly received, and the infirmities I had contracted in England by extreme cold and hard&s;hips, that I had un|dergone in many long and &s;ore impri&s;onments, returned upon me at &s;ea; &s;o that I was very ill in my &s;tomach, and full of violem pains in my bones and limbs. This was after I had been at &s;ea about a month; for about three weeks after I came fir&s;t to &s;ea, I &s;weat abundantly, chiefly my head; and my body broke out in pimples, and my legs and feet &s;welled extremely, &s;o that my &s;tockings and &s;lippers could not be drawn on without difficulty and great pain. On a &s;udden the &s;weating cea&s;ed, &s;o that when I came into the hot climate, where others &s;weat mo&s;t freely, I could not &s;weat at all; but my fle&s;h was hot, dry, and burning, and that which before broke out in pimples &s;truck in again to my &s;tomach and heart; &s;o that I was very ill, and weak beyond expre&s;&s;ion. Thus I continued during the re&s;t of the voyage, which was about a month; for we were &s;even weeks and &s;ome odd days at &s;ea.</P>
<P>The third of the eighth month, early in the morning, we di&s;covered the i&s;land of Barbadoes; but it was between nine and ten at night ere we came to anchor in Carli&s;le-bay. We
<PB N="131" REF="037441_0647_100D925CFABB4358">got on &s;hore as &s;oon as we could, and I with &s;ome others walked to a friend's hou&s;e, a merchant, who&s;e name was Richard For&s;tall, above a quarter of a mile from the bridge. But being very ill and weak, I was &s;o tired, that I was in a manner &s;pent by that time I got thither. There I abode very ill &s;everal days, and though they &s;everal times gave me things to make me &s;weat, they could not effect it. What they gave me did rather parch and dry up my body, and made me probably wor&s;e than otherwi&s;e I might have been. Thus I continued about three weeks after I landed, having much pain in my bones, joints, and whole body, &s;o that I could hardly get any re&s;t; yet I was pretty cheary, and my &s;pirit kept above it all. Neither did my illne&s;s take me off from the &s;ervice of truth; but both while I was at &s;ea, and after I came to Barbadoes, before I was able to travel about, I gave forth &s;everal papers (having a friend to write for me) &s;ome of which I &s;ent by the fir&s;t conveyance for England to be printed.</P>
<P>After I had re&s;ted three or four days at Richard For|&s;tall's, where many friends came to vi&s;it me, John Rous, having borrowed a coach of colonel Chamberlain, came to fetch me to his father Thomas Rous's. But it was late ere we could get thither, and little or no re&s;t could I take that night. A few days after, colonel Chamberlain, who had &s;o kindly lent his coach, came to give me a vi&s;it, and car|ried him&s;elf very courteou&s;ly towards me.</P>
<P>Soon after I came into the i&s;land, I was informed of a remarkable pa&s;&s;age, wherein the ju&s;tice of God did emi|nently appear: It was thus. There was a young man of Barbadoes, who&s;e name was John Drakes (a per&s;on of &s;ome note in the world's account, but a common &s;wearer and a bad man) who, when he was in London, had a mind to marry a friend's daughter, left by her mother very young, with a con&s;iderable portion, to the care and government of &s;everal friends, whereof I was one. He made application to me, that he might have my con&s;ent to marry this young maid. I told him, <Q>I was one of her over&s;eers appointed by her mother, who was a widow, to take care of her; that if her mother had intended her for a match to any man of another profe&s;&s;ion, &s;he would have di&s;po&s;ed her accordingly; but &s;he committed her to us, that &s;he might be trained up in the fear of the Lord; and therefore I &s;hould betray the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me, if I &s;hould con&s;ent that he, who was out of the fear of God, &s;hould marry
<PB N="132" REF="037441_0648_100D925F318D5938">her; which I would not do.</Q> When he &s;aw that he could not obtain his de&s;ire, he returned to Barbadoes with great offence of mind again&s;t me, but without a ju&s;t cau&s;e. After|wards, when he heard I was coming to Barbadoes, he &s;wore de&s;perately, and threatened, <Q>if he could po&s;&s;ibly procure it, he would have me burned to death when I came there.</Q> Which a friend hearing, a&s;ked him, <Q>What I had done to him, that he was &s;o violent again&s;t me?</Q> He would not an&s;wer, but &s;aid again, 'I'll have him burned.' Where|upon the friend replied, <Q>Do not march on too furiou&s;ly, left thou come too &s;oon to thy journey's end.</Q> About ten days after, he was &s;truck with a violent burning fever, of which he died; by which his body was &s;o &s;corched, that the people &s;aid, 'It was as black as a coal; and three days before I landed, his body was laid in the du&s;t. This was taken notice of as a &s;ad example.</P>
<P>While I continued &s;o weak that I could not go abroad to meetings, the other friends that came over with me be&s;tirred them&s;elves in the Lord's work. The next day but one after we came on &s;hore, they had a great meeting at the Bridge, and after that &s;everal meetings in different parts of the i&s;land; which alarmed the people of all &s;orts, &s;o that many came to our meetings, and &s;ome of the chiefe&s;t rank. For they had got my name, under&s;tanding I was come upon the i&s;land, and expected to have &s;een me, not knowing I was unable to go abroad. And indeed my weakne&s;s continued the lon|ger on me, by rea&s;on that my &s;pirit was much pre&s;&s;ed down at the fir&s;t with the filth and dirt, the unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of the people, which lay as an heavy weight and load upon me. But after I had been above a month upon the i&s;land, my &s;pirit became &s;omewhat ea&s;ier, I began to recover my health and &s;trength, and get abroad among friends. In the meantime, having an opportunity to &s;end to England, I wrote to friends there, to let them know how it was with me.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been very weak the&s;e &s;even weeks pa&s;t, and not able to write my&s;elf. My de&s;ire is to you, and for you all, that ye may live in the fear of God, and in love one unto another, and be &s;ubject one to another in the fear of God. I have been weaker in my body than ever I was in my life that I remember, yea, my pains have been &s;uch as I cannot expre&s;s; yet my heart and &s;pirit are &s;trong. I have hardly &s;weated the&s;e &s;even weeks pa&s;t,
<PB N="133" REF="037441_0649_100D9261220DBA48">though I am in a very hot climate, where hardly any but are well nigh continually &s;weating; but as for me, my old brui&s;es, colds, numbne&s;s, and pains &s;truck inwardly, even to my very heart. So that little re&s;t I have taken, and the chiefe&s;t things that were comfortable to my &s;tomach were a little water and powdered ginger; but now I begin to drink a little beer as well as water, and &s;ometimes a lit|tle wine and water mixed. Great pains and travails I have felt, and in mea&s;ure am under; but it is well, my life is over all. This i&s;land was to me as all on a fire ere I came to it, but now it is &s;omewhat quenched and abated. I came in weakne&s;s among&s;t tho&s;e that are &s;trong, and have &s;o continued; but now I am got a little cheary, and over it. Many friends, and &s;ome con&s;iderable per&s;ons of the world, have been with me. I tired out my body much when among&s;t you in England; it is the Lord's power that helps me; therefore I de&s;ire you all to prize the power of the Lord and his truth. I was but weak in body when I left you, after I had been in my great travail among&s;t you; but after that it &s;truck all back again into my body, which was not well &s;ettled after &s;uch &s;ore travails in En|gland. Then I was &s;o tired at &s;ea, that I could not re&s;t, and have had little or no &s;tomach a long time. Since I came into the i&s;land, my life hath been very much bur|dened; but I hope, if the Lord gives me &s;trength to ma|nage his work, I &s;hall work thoroughly, and bring things that have been out of cour&s;e into better order. So, dear friends, live all in the peaceable truth, and in the love of it, &s;erving the Lord in newne&s;s of life; for glorious things and precious truths have been manife&s;ted among you plen|tifully, to you the riches of the kingdom have been reach|ed. I have been almo&s;t a month in this i&s;land, but have not been able to go abroad or ride out; only very lately I rode out twice, a quarter of a mile at a time, which wea|ried me much. My love in the truth is to you all.</P>

<P>Becau&s;e I was not well able to travel, the friends of the i&s;land concluded to have their men's and women's meeting for the &s;ervice of the church at Thomas Rous's, where I lay; by which means I was pre&s;ent at each of their meet|ings, and had very good &s;ervice for the Lord in both. For they had need of information in many things, divers di&s;or|ders being crept in for want of care and watchfulne&s;s. <Q>I
<PB N="134" REF="037441_0650_100D926348D75610">exhorted them, more e&s;pecially at the men's meeting, to be careful with re&s;pect to marriages, to prevent friends marrying in near kindreds, and al&s;o to prevent over-ha&s;ty proceedings towards &s;econd marriages after the death of a former hu&s;band or wife; advi&s;ing that a decent regard be had in &s;uch ca&s;es to the memory of the decea&s;ed hu&s;band or wife. As to friends children marrying too young, at thirteen or fourteen years of age, I &s;hewed the unfitne&s;s thereof, and the inconveniencies and hurts that attend &s;uch, childi&s;h marriages. I admoni&s;hed them to purge the floor thoroughly, and to &s;weep their hou&s;es very clean, that nothing might remain that would defile; and that all &s;hould take care, that nothing be &s;poken out of their meet|ings to the blemi&s;hing or defaming one of another. Concern|ing regi&s;tering of marriages, births, and burials, I advi&s;ed them to keep exact records of each in di&s;tinct books for that only u&s;e; and al&s;o to record in a book for that pur|po&s;e, the condemnations of &s;uch as went out from truth into di&s;orderly practices, and the repentance and re&s;tora|tion of &s;uch as returned again. I recommended to their care the providing of convenient burying-places for friends, which in &s;ome parts were yet wanting. Some directions al&s;o I gave them concerning wills, and the ordering of le|gacies left by friends for publick u&s;es, and other things re|lating to the affairs of the church. Re&s;pecting their ne|groes, I de&s;ired them to endeavour to train them up in the fear of God, as well tho&s;e that were bought with their money, as them that were born in their families, that all might come to the knowledge of the Lord; that &s;o, with Jo&s;hua, every ma&s;ter of a family might &s;ay, <Q>As for me and my hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord.</Q> I de&s;ired al&s;o, that they would cau&s;e their over&s;eers to deal mildly and gently with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">groes, and not u&s;e cruelty towards them, as the manner of &s;ome hath been and is; and that after certain years of &s;ervitude they &s;hould make them free.</Q> Many &s;weet and precious things were opened in the&s;e meet|ings, by the Spirit and in the power of the Lord, to the edifying, confirming, and building up of friends in the faith and holy order of the go&s;pel.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="135" REF="037441_0651_100D9265397296B8">
<P>DEAR friends and brethren, to whom is my love in that which never changeth, but remains in glory, which is over all, the top and corner-&s;tone. In this all have peace and life, as ye dwell in the ble&s;&s;ed &s;eed, where|in all is ble&s;&s;ed, over that which brought the cur&s;e; where all &s;hortne&s;s, narrowne&s;s of &s;pirit, brittlene&s;s, and peevi&s;h|ne&s;s is. Therefore keep the holy order of the go&s;pel. Keep in this ble&s;&s;ed &s;eed, where all may be kept in tem|perance, in patience, in love, in meekne&s;s, in righteou&s;|ne&s;s and holine&s;s, and in peace; in which the Lord may be &s;een among&s;t you, and no way di&s;honoured, but glorified by you all. In all your meetings, in cities, towns, and countries, men's meetings, women's meetings, and others, let righteou&s;ne&s;s flow among you, the holy truth be up|permo&s;t, the pure Spirit your guide and leader, and the holy wi&s;dom from above your orderer, that is pure, gentle, and ea&s;y to be intreated. Keep in the religion that pre|&s;erves from the &s;pots of the world, which is pure and un|defiled in God's &s;ight. Keep in the pure and holy wor|&s;hip, in which the pure and holy God is wor&s;hipped, viz. in the Spirit, and in the truth, which the devil is out of, who is the author of all unholine&s;s, and of that which di&s;|honours God. Be tender of God's glory, of his honour, and of his ble&s;&s;ed and holy name, in which ye are gathered. All who profe&s;s the truth, &s;ee that ye walk in it, in right|eou&s;ne&s;s, holine&s;s, and godline&s;s; for <Q>holine&s;s becomes the hou&s;e of God, the hou&s;ehold of faith.</Q> That which becomes God's hou&s;e, God loves.

Therefore &s;ee that righteou&s;ne&s;s run down in all your a&s;&s;emblies, that it flow, to drive away all un|righteou&s;ne&s;s. This pre&s;erves your peace with God; for in righteou&s;ne&s;s ye all have peace with the righteous God of peace, and one with another. Every one that bears the name of the Anointed, that high title of being a Chri&s;tian, named after the Heavenly Man, &s;ee that ye be in the di|vine nature made conformable unto his image, even the image of the Heavenly Divine Man, who was before that image which Adam and Eve got from Satan in the fall &s;o that in none of you that fallen image may appear, but his image, and you made conformable unto him. Here tran&s;lation is &s;hewed forth in life and conver&s;ation, not in words only; yea, and conver&s;ion and repentance, which is a change of the nature, of the mind, and of the heart,
<PB N="136" REF="037441_0652_100D92672E064D88">of the &s;pirit and affections, which have been below, and come to be &s;et above; and &s;o receive the things that are from above, and have the conver&s;ation in heaven, not that conver&s;ation which is according to the power of the prince of the air, that now rules in the di&s;obedient. So be faith|ful; this is the word of the Lord God unto you all. See, that godline&s;s, holine&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s, truth, and virtue, the fruits of the good Spirit, flow over the bad and its fruits, that ye may an&s;wer that which is of God in all; for your Heavenly Father is glorified, in that you bring forth much fruit. Therefore ye, who are plants of his planting, his trees of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ee that every tree be full of fruit. Keep in true humility, and in the true love of God, which doth edify his body, that the true nouri&s;h|ment from the head, the refre&s;hings, &s;prings, and rivers of water, and bread of life may be plenteou&s;ly known and felt among&s;t you, that &s;o prai&s;es may a&s;cend to God. Be faithful to the Lord God, and ju&s;t and true in all your dealings and doings with and towards men. Be not negli|gent in your men's meetings to admoni&s;h, exhort, and re|prove, in the &s;pirit of love and of meekne&s;s, and to &s;eek that which is lo&s;t, and to bring back again that which hath been driven away. Let all minds, &s;pirits, &s;ouls, and hearts, be bended down under the yoke of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the power of God. Much I could write, but am weak, and have been mo&s;tly &s;ince I left you. Burdens and tra|vails I have been under, and gone through many ways; but it is well. The Lord Almighty knows my work, which he hath &s;ent me forth to do by his everla&s;ting arm and power, which is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting. Ble&s;|&s;ed be his holy name, which I am in, and in which my love is to you all.</P>

<P>After I was able to go abroad, and had been a little among&s;t friends, I went to vi&s;it the governor; Lewis Mor|rice, Thomas Rou&s;e, and &s;ome other friends being with me. He received us very civilly, and treated us very kindly; making us dine with him, and keeping us mo&s;t part of the day before he let us go away.</P>
<P>The &s;ame week I went to Bridge Town. There was to be a general meeting of friends that week; and the vi&s;it I had made to the governor, and the kind reception I had with him, being generally known to the officers, civil and
<PB N="137" REF="037441_0653_100D92692187EC60">military, many came to this meeting from mo&s;t parts of the i&s;land, and tho&s;e not of the meane&s;t rank; divers of them being judges or ju&s;tices, colonels or captains; &s;o that a very great meeting we had of friends and others. The Lord's ble&s;&s;ed power was plentifully with us, and though I was &s;omewhat &s;traitened for time, three other friends having &s;poken before me, the Lord opened things through me to the general and great &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e pre&s;ent. Colonel Lewis Morrice came to this meeting, and with him a judge in the country, who&s;e name was Ralph Fretwell; who was well &s;atisfied, and received the truth.</P>
<P>Paul Gwin, a jangling Bapti&s;t, came into the meeting, and a&s;ked me, <Q>How I &s;pelt Cain? and whether I had the &s;ame &s;pirit as the apo&s;tles had?</Q> I told him, Yes. And he bade the judge take notice of it. I told him, <Q>He that had not a mea&s;ure of the &s;ame Holy Gho&s;t as the apo&s;tles had, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an unclean &s;pirit.</Q> And then he went his way.</P>
<P>I went home with Lewis Morrice that night, being about nine or ten miles; going part of the way by boat, the re&s;t on hor&s;eback. The place where his plantation was I thought to be the fine&s;t air of the i&s;land. Next day Thomas Briggs and William Edmund&s;on came to &s;ee me, they intending to leave the i&s;land the day following, and to go upon the Lord's &s;ervice to Antigua and Nevis. Lewis Morrice went with them. At Antigua they had &s;everal good meetings, to which there was a great re&s;ort of people; and many were convinced. But when they went to Nevis, the governor, an old per&s;ecutor, &s;ent &s;oldiers on board the ve&s;&s;el, to &s;top them, and would not &s;uffer them to land. Wherefore, after friends of the place had been on board the ve&s;&s;el with them, and they had been &s;weetly refre&s;hed together, in feeling the Lord's power and pre&s;ence among&s;t them, they returned to Antigua; where having &s;taid awhile longer, they came again to Barbadoes; Thomas Briggs being very weak and ill.</P>
<P>Of the other friends that came over with me, James Lan|ca&s;ter, John Cartwright, and George Patti&s;on, were gone &s;ome time before to Jamaica, and others to other places; &s;o that few remained in Barbadoes with me. We had ma|ny great and precious meetings, both for wor&s;hip, and for the affairs of the church; to the former of which many of other &s;ocieties came. At one of the&s;e meetings, colonel Lyne, a &s;ober per&s;on, was &s;o well &s;atisfied with what I de|clared
<PB N="138" REF="037441_0654_100D926B1CA11DE8">that he &s;aid, <Q>Now I can gain&s;ay &s;uch as I have heard &s;peak evil of you; who &s;ay you do not own Chri&s;t, nor that he died: whereas I perceive you exalt Chri&s;t in all his offices, beyond what I have ever heard before.</Q> This man, ob&s;erving one to take in writing the heads of what I delivered, de&s;ired him &s;o let him have a copy of it; and &s;aid another day with us before he went away; &s;o great a love was rai&s;ed in him to the truth. A very great convince|ment there was in mo&s;t parts of the i&s;land; which made the prie&s;t and &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors fret and rage. Our meetings were very large, and free from di&s;turbance from the govern|ment; though the envious prie&s;ts and &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors en|deavoured to &s;tir up the magi&s;trates again&s;t us. When they found they could not prevail that way, &s;ome Bapti&s;ts came to the meeting at the town, which was full of people of &s;e|veral ranks and qualities. A great company came with them; and they brought a &s;landerous paper written by John Pennyman with which they made a great noi&s;e. But the Lord gave me wi&s;dom and utterance to an&s;wer their cavils; &s;o that the auditory generally received &s;atisfac|tion, and tho&s;e quarrel&s;ome profe&s;&s;ors lo&s;t ground. When they had wearied them&s;elves with clamour, they went away; but the people &s;taying, the meeting was continued; the things they cavilled about were further opened and cleared, and the life and power of God came over all. But the rage and envy in our adver&s;aries did not cea&s;e; they endea|voured to defame friends with many fal&s;e and &s;candalous reports, which they &s;pread through the i&s;land. Whereupon I, with &s;ome other friends, drew up a paper, to go forth in the name of the people called Quakers, for the clearing truth and friends from tho&s;e fal&s;e reports. It was after this manner:</P>

<P>WHEREAS many &s;candalous lies and &s;landers have been ca&s;t upon us, to render us odious; as that "We deny God. Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and the &s;criptures of truth." &amp;c. This is to inform you, That all our books and de|claractions, which for the&s;e many years have been publi&s;h|ed to the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d, clearly te&s;tify the contrary. Yet for your &s;atisfaction, we now p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mly and &s;incerely declare,
<PB N="139" REF="037441_0655_100D926CAB478760">That we own and believe in the only Wi&s;e, Omnipotent, and Everla&s;ting God, the Creator of all things in heaven and earth, and the Pre&s;erver of all that he hath made; who is God over all, ble&s;&s;ed for ever; to whom be all honour, glory, dominion, prai&s;e and thank&s;giving, both now and for evermore! And we own and believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his beloved and only begotten Son, in whom he is well plea&s;ed; who was conceived by the Holy Gho&s;t, and born of the Virgin Mary; in whom we have redemp|tion through his blood, even the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins; who is the expre&s;s image of the Invi&s;ible God, the fir&s;t-born of every creature, by whom were all things created that are in heaven and in earth, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, whether they be thrones, dominions, principalities, or powers; all things were created by him. And we own and believe that he was made a &s;acrifice for &s;in, who knew no &s;in, neither was guile found in his mouth; that he was cruci|fied for us in the fle&s;h, without the gates of Jeru&s;alem; and that he was buried, and ro&s;e again the third day by the power of his Father, for our ju&s;tification; and that he a&s;cended up into heaven, and now &s;itteth at the right hand of God. This Je&s;us, who was the foundation of the holy prophets and apo&s;tles, is our foundation; and we be|lieve there is no other foundation to be laid but that which is laid, even Chri&s;t Je&s;us: who ta&s;ted death for every man, &s;hed his blood for all men, is the propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world: according as John the Bapti&s;t te&s;tified of him, when he &s;aid, <Q>Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the &s;ins of the world,</Q> John i. 29. We believe that he alone is our Redeemer and Saviour, the captain of our &s;alvation, who &s;aves us from &s;in, as well as from hell and the wrath to come, and de&s;troys the devil and his works; he is the Seed of the woman that brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head, to wit, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Alpha and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Fir&s;t and the La&s;t. He is (as the &s;criptures of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ay of him) our wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, ju&s;tification, and redemption; nei|ther is there &s;alvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we may be &s;aved. He alone is the Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of our &s;ouls: he is our Prophet, whom Mo&s;es long &s;ince te&s;tifi|ed of, &s;aying, <Q>A prophet &s;hall the Lord your God rai&s;e up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him &s;hall ye hear in all things, what&s;oever he &s;hall &s;ay unto you:
<PB N="140" REF="037441_0656_100D926F8CBC6BF8">and it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that every &s;oul that will not hear that prophet &s;hall be de&s;troyed from among the peo|ple,</Q> Acts ii. 22, 23. He is now come in Spirit, <Q>and hath given us an under&s;tanding, that we know him that is true.</Q> He rules in our hearts by his law of love and life, and makes us free from the law of &s;in and death. We have no life, but by him; for he is the quickening Spirit, the &s;econd Adam, the Lord from heaven, by who&s;e blood we are clean&s;ed, and our con&s;ciences &s;prinkled from dead works, to &s;erve the living God. He is our Media|tor, who makes peace and reconciliation between God offended and us offending; he being the Oath of God, the new covenant of light, life, grace, and peace, the au|thor and fini&s;her of our faith. This Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the heavenly man, the Emanuel, God with us, we all own and believe in; he whom the high-prie&s;t raged again&s;t, and &s;aid, he had &s;poken bla&s;phemy; whom the prie&s;ts and elders of the Jews took coun&s;el together again&s;t, and put to death; the &s;ame whom Judas betrayed for thirty pieces of &s;ilver, which the prie&s;ts gave him as a reward for his trea&s;on; who al&s;o gave large money to the &s;oldiers to broach an horrible lie, namely, <Q>That his di&s;ciples came and &s;tole him away by night whil&s;t they &s;lept.</Q> After he was ri&s;en from the dead, the hi&s;tory of the Acts of the apo&s;tles &s;ets forth how the chief prie&s;ts and elders per&s;e|cuted the di&s;ciples of this Je&s;us, for preaching Chri&s;t and his re&s;urrection. This, we &s;ay, is that Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom we own to be our life and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Concerning the holy &s;criptures, we believe they were given forth by the holy Spirit of God, through the holy men of God, who (as the &s;cripture it&s;elf declares, 2 Pet. i. 21.) "&s;poke as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t." We believe they are to be read, believed, and fulfilled (he that fulfils them is Chri&s;t); and they are <Q>profitable for re|proof, for correction and for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">d may be perfect, throughly furni&s;hed unto all good works,</Q> 2 Tim. 3. 19. and are able to "make wi&s;e unto &s;alvation, through faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." We believe the holy &s;criptures are the words of God; for it is &s;aid in Exodes 20. 1. <Q>God &s;pake all the&s;e words, &s;aying,</Q> &amp;c. meaning the ten commandments given forth upon mount Sinai. And in Rev. xxii. 18. &s;aith John, <Q>I te&s;tify to every man that heareth the words of the pro|phecy of this book, if any man addeth unto the&s;e, and if
<PB N="141" REF="037441_0657_100D9271956F2EC0">any man &s;hall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy</Q> (not the Word) &amp;c. So in Luke 1. 20. "Becau&s;e thou believe&s;t not my words." And in John v. 47. xv. 7. xiv. 23. xii. 47. So that we call the holy &s;criptures, as Chri&s;t, the apo&s;tles, and holy men of God called them, viz. the words of God.</P>
<P>Another &s;lander they have ca&s;t upon us, is, <Q>That we teach the negroes to rebel:</Q> a thing we utterly abhor in our hearts, the Lord knows it, who is the &s;earcher of all hearts, and knows all things, and can te&s;tify for us, that this is a mo&s;t abominable untruth. That which we have &s;poken to them, is To exhort and admoni&s;h them to be &s;ober, to fear God, to love their ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, to be faithful and diligent in their &s;ervice and bu&s;ine&s;s, and then their ma&s;ters and over&s;eers would love them, and deal kindly and gently with them; al&s;o that they &s;hould not beat their wives, nor the wives their hu&s;bands; neither &s;hould the men have many wives; that they &s;hould not &s;teal, nor be drunk, nor commit adultery, nor fornication, nor cur&s;e, &s;wear, nor lie, nor give bad words to one ano|ther, nor to any one el&s;e; for there is &s;omething in them that tells them they &s;hould not practi&s;e the&s;e nor any other evils. But if they notwith&s;tanding &s;hould do them, then we let them know there are but two ways, the one that leads to heaven, where the righteous go; and the other that leads to hell, where the wicked and debauched, whoremongers, adulterers, murderers, and liars go. To the one the Lord will &s;ay, <Q>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Fa|ther, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</Q> to the other, <Q>Depart, ye cur&s;|ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</Q> &s;o the wicked go into <Q>everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, but the righteous into life eternal,</Q> Mat. xxv. Con&s;ider, friends, it is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion for a ma&s;ter of a family to in|&s;truct his family him&s;elf, or for others to do it in his be|half; but rather it is a very great duty incumbent upon them. Abraham and Jo&s;hua did &s;o: of the fir&s;t, the Lord &s;aid, Gen. xviii. 19. <Q>I know that Abraham will command his children, and his hou&s;ehold after him; and they &s;hall keep the way of the Lord, to do ju&s;tice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham the things that he hath &s;poken of him.</Q> And the latter &s;aid, Jo&s;h. xxiv. 15. <Q>Choo&s;e ye this day whom ye will &s;erve &mdash;But as for me and my hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord.</Q>

<P>This wicked &s;lander (of our endeavouring to make the Negroes rebel) our adver&s;aries took occa&s;ion to rai&s;e, from our having &s;ome meetings among&s;t the Negroes; for we had &s;everal meetings with them in divers plantations, where|in we exhorted them to ju&s;tice, &s;obriety, temperance, cha|&s;tity, and piety, and to be &s;ubject to their ma&s;ters and governors. Which was altogether contrary to what our envious adver&s;aries maliciou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t us.</P>
<P>As I had been to vi&s;it the governor, as &s;oon as I was well able, after I came thither; &s;o when I was at Thomas Rou&s;e's, the governor came to &s;ee me, carrying him&s;elf very courteou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Having been three months or more in Barbadoes, and having vi&s;ited friends, thoroughly &s;ettled meetings, and di&s;|patched the &s;ervice for which the Lord brought me thither; I felt my &s;pirit clear of that i&s;land, and found drawings to Jamaica. Which when I had communicated to friends, I acquainted the governor al&s;o, and divers of his council, with my intention; which I did, that as my coming thither was open and publick, &s;o my departure al&s;o might be.

<P>I &s;et &s;ail from Barbadoes to Jamaica the eighth of the eleventh month, 1671, Robert Widders, William Edmund|&s;on, Solomon Eccles, and Elizabeth Hooton going with me. Thomas Briggs and John Stubbs remained in Barba|does; with whom were John Rou&s;e and William Baily. We had a quick and ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age to Jamaica; where we met with James Lanca&s;ter, John Cartwright, and George Patti&s;on again, who had been labouring there in the &s;ervice of truth; into which we forthwith entered with them, tra|velling up and down through the i&s;land, which is large; and a brave country it is, though the people are many of them debauched and wicked. We had much &s;ervice. There was a great convincement, and many received the truth; &s;ome of which were people of account in the world. We had many meetings there, which were large, and very quiet. The people were civil to us, &s;o that not a mouth was opened again&s;t us. I was twice with the governor, and &s;ome other magi&s;trates, who all carried them&s;elves kindly towards me.</P>
<P>About a week after we landed in Jamaica, Elizabeth Hooton, a woman of great age, who had travelled much in truth's &s;ervice, and &s;uffered much for it, departed this life.
<PB N="144" REF="037441_0660_100D9277220A9D68">She was well the day before &s;he died; and departed in peace, like a lamb, bearing te&s;timony to truth at her departure.</P>
<P>When we had been about &s;even weeks in Jamaica, had brought friends into pretty good order, and &s;ettled &s;everal meetings among&s;t them, we left Solomon Eccles there; the re&s;t of as embarked for Maryland; leaving friends and truth pro&s;perous in Jamaica, the Lord's power being over all, and his ble&s;&s;ed Seed reigning.</P>

<P>TO whom is my love, and to the children, in that which changeth not, but is over all; and to all friends in tho&s;e parts. I have been at Jamaica about five weeks. Friends are generally well; and here is a con|vincement; but things would be too large to write of. Sufferings in every place attend me; but the ble&s;&s;ed Seed is over all: the great Lord be prai&s;ed, who is Lord of &s;ea and land, and of all things therein. We intend to pa&s;s from hence about the beginning of the next month, to|wards Maryland, if the Lord plea&s;e. Dwell all of you in the Seed of God. In his truth I re&s;t in love to you all.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>We went on board the 8th of the fir&s;t month 1671-2; and having contrary winds, were a full week &s;ailing for|wards and backwards, before we could get out of &s;ight of Jamaica. A difficult voyage this proved, and pretty dan|gerous, e&s;pecially in our pa&s;&s;ing through the gulph of Flo|rida, where we met with many winds and &s;torms. But the great God, who is Lord of &s;ea and land, and who rideth upon the wings of the wind, did by his power pre&s;erve us through many and great dangers, when by extreme &s;tre&s;s of weather our ve&s;&s;el was divers times like to be over&s;et, and much of her tackling broken. And indeed we were &s;en&s;ible that the Lord was a God at hand, and that his ear was open to the &s;upplications of his people. For when the winds were &s;o &s;trong and boi&s;terous, and the &s;torms and tempe&s;ts &s;o great, that the &s;ailors knew not what to do, but let the &s;hip go which way &s;he would; then did we pray unto the Lord; who did graciou&s;ly hear and accept us, and did
<PB N="145" REF="037441_0661_100D9279784F0A00">calm the winds and &s;eas, gave us &s;ea&s;onable weather, and made us to rejoice in his &s;alvation; ble&s;&s;ed and prai&s;ed be the holy name of the Lord, who&s;e power hath dominion over all, and whom the winds and &s;eas obey!</P>
<P>We were between &s;ix and &s;even weeks in this pa&s;&s;age from Jamaica to Maryland. Some days before we came to land, after we had entered the bay of Patuxent river, a great &s;torm aro&s;e, which ca&s;t a boat upon us for &s;helter; in which were divers men and women of account in the world. We took them in; but the boat was lo&s;t, with five hundred pounds worth of goods in it, as they &s;aid. They continued on board us &s;everal days, not having any means to get off; and we had a very good meeting with them in the &s;hip. But provi&s;ions grew &s;hort, for they brought none in with them; and ours, by rea&s;on of the length of our voyage, were well nigh &s;pent when they came to us: &s;o that with their living upon it too, we had now little or none left. Whereupon George Patti&s;on took a boat, and ventured his life to get to &s;hore; the hazard was &s;o great, that all but friends concluded he would be ca&s;t away. Yet it plea&s;ed the Lord to bring him &s;afe to land; and in a &s;hort time af|ter the friends of the place came to fetch us to land al&s;o, in a &s;ea&s;onable time, for our provi&s;ions were quite &s;pent.</P>
<P>We partook al&s;o of another great deliverance in this voy|age, through the good providence of the Lord, which we under&s;tood afterwards. When we were determined to come from Jamaica, we had our choice of two ve&s;&s;els, both bound for the &s;ame coa&s;t. One was a frigate, the other a yacht. The ma&s;ter of the frigate, we thought, a&s;ked unrea&s;onably for our pa&s;&s;age; which made us agree with the ma&s;ter of the yacht, who offered to carry us ten &s;hillings a piece cheaper than the other. We went on board the yacht, and the fri|gate came out together with us, intending to be con&s;orts during the voyage; and for &s;everal days we &s;ailed together: but what with calms and contrary winds, we were in awhile &s;eparated. After which, the frigate, lo&s;ing her way, fell among the Spaniards; by whom &s;he was plundered and robbed, and the ma&s;ter and mate made pri&s;oners; after|wards, being retaken by the Engli&s;h, &s;he was &s;ent home to her owners in Virginia, Which when we came to under|&s;tand, we &s;aw and admired the Providence of God, who pre&s;erved us out of our enemies hands; and he that was covetous fell among the covetous.</P>
<P>Here we found Burneyate, intending &s;hortly to &s;ail for
<PB N="146" REF="037441_0662_100D927B0D84A9B0">Old England; but upon our arrival he altered his purpo&s;e, and joined us in the Lord's &s;ervice. He had appointed a general meeting for all the friends in the province of Mary|land, that he might &s;ee them together, and take his leave of them, before he departed out of the country; and it was &s;o ordered by the good providence of God, that we landed ju&s;t time enough to reach that meeting; by which means we had a very &s;ea&s;onable opportunity of taking the friends of the province together. A very large meeting this was, and held four days; to which, be&s;ides friends, came many other people, divers of whom were of con&s;iderable quality in the world's account: for there were five or &s;ix ju&s;tices of the peace, the &s;peaker of their a&s;&s;embly, one of their coun|cil, and others of note, who &s;eemed well &s;atisfied with the meeting. After the publick meetings were over, the men's and women's meetings began; wherein I opened to friends the &s;evice thereof, to their great &s;atisfaction. After this we went to the Cliffs, where another general meeting was ap|pointed. We went &s;ome of the way by land, the re&s;t by water; and a &s;torm ari&s;ing, our boat was run aground, in danger to be beaten to pieces, and the water came in upon us. I was in a great &s;weat, having come very hot out of a meeting before, and now was wet with the water be&s;ides: yet having faith in the divine power, I was pre&s;erved from taking hurt, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord! To this meeting many came, who received the truth with reverence. We had al&s;o a men's meeting and a women's meeting. Mo&s;t of the back&s;liders came in again; and &s;everal of tho&s;e meetings were e&s;tabli&s;hed for taking care of the affairs of the church.</P>
<P>After the&s;e two general meetings, we parted company, dividing our&s;elves unto &s;everal coa&s;ts, for the &s;ervice of truth. James Lanca&s;ter and John Cartwright went by &s;ea for New-England; William Edmund&s;on and three friends more &s;ailed for Virginia, where things were much out of order; John Burnyeate, Robert Widders. George Patti&s;on, and I, with &s;everal friends of the province, went over by boat to the ea&s;tern &s;hore, and had a meeting there on the fir&s;t-day; where many people received the truth with glad|ne&s;s, and friends were greatly refre&s;hed. A very large and heavenly meeting it was. Several per&s;ons of quality in that country were at it, two of whom were ju&s;tices of the peace. It was upon me from the Lord to &s;end to the In|dian emperor and his kings, to come to that meeting; the emperor came, and was at the meeting; but his kings, lying
<PB N="147" REF="037441_0663_100D927D52A84A78">further off, could not reach thither time enough; yet they came after with their cockaroo&s;es. I had in the evening two good opportunities with them; they heard the word of the Lord willingly, and confe&s;&s;ed to it. <Q>What I &s;poke to them. I de&s;ired them to &s;peak to their people; and let them know, that God was rai&s;ing up his tabernacle of witne&s;s in their wilderne&s;s-country, and was &s;etting up his &s;tandard and glorious en&s;ign of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q> They car|ried them&s;elves very courteou&s;ly and lovingly; and in|quired, <Q>Where the next meeting would be, and they would come to it.</Q> Yet they &s;aid, <Q>They had a great debate with their council about their coming, before they came now.</Q></P>
<P>The next day we began our journey by land to New|England; a tedious journey through the woods and wil|derne&s;s, over bogs and great rivers. We took hor&s;e at the head of Tredaven Creek, and travelled through the woods till we came a little above the head of Miles River; by which we pa&s;&s;ed, and rode to the head of Wye River; and &s;o to the head of Che&s;ter River; where, making a fire, we took up our lodging in the woods. Next morning we travelled the woods till we came to Sa&s;&s;afras River, which we went over in canoes (or Indian boats) cau&s;ing our hor&s;es to &s;wim by. Then we rode to Bohemia River; where in like manner &s;wimming our hor&s;es, we our&s;elves went over in canoes. We re&s;ted a little at a plantation by the way, but not long, for we had thirty miles to ride that af|ternoon, if we would reach a town; which we were willing to do, and therefore rode hard for it. I with &s;ome others, who&s;e hor&s;es were &s;trong, got to the town that night ex|ceedingly tired, and wet to the &s;kin; but George Patti&s;on and Robert Widders, being weaker-hor&s;ed, were obliged to lay in the woods that night al&s;o. The town we went to was a Dutch town, called Newca&s;tle; whither Robert Wid|ders and George Patti&s;on came to us next morning. We departed thence, and got over the river Delaware, not with|out great danger of &s;ome of our lives. When we were over, we were troubled to procure guides; which were hard to get, and very chargeable. Then had we that wilderne&s;s country to pa&s;s through, &s;ince called We&s;t Jer&s;ey, not then inhabited by Engli&s;h; &s;o that we have travelled a whole day together without &s;eeing man or woman, hou&s;e or dwel|ling-place. Sometimes we lay in the woods by a fire, and &s;ometimes in the Indians wigwams or hou&s;es. We came
<PB N="148" REF="037441_0664_100D927F527BDF60">one night to an Indian town, and lay at the king's hou&s;e, who was a very pretty man. Both he and his wife received us very lovingly, and his attendants (&s;uch as they were) were very re&s;pectful to us. They laid us mats to lie on; but provi&s;ion was very &s;hort with them, having caught but little that day. At another Indian town, where we &s;taid, the king came to us, and he could &s;peak &s;ome Engli&s;h. I &s;poke to him much, and al&s;o to his people; and they were very loving to us. At length we came to Middletown, an Engli&s;h plantation in Ea&s;t Jer&s;ey; and there were &s;ome friends; but we could not &s;tay to have a meeting at that time, being earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed in our &s;pirits to get to the half-year's meeting of friends at Oy&s;ter-Bay in Long|I&s;land, which was near at hand. We went with a friend, Richard Hart&s;horn, brother to Hugh Hart&s;horn, the up|hol&s;terer in London, who received us gladly to his hou&s;e, where we refre&s;hed our&s;elves, and then he carried us and our hor&s;es in his own beat over a great water, which held us mo&s;t part of the day in getting over, and &s;et us upon Long-I&s;land. We got that evening to friends at Grave, &s;end, with whom we tarried that night. Next day we got to Flu&s;hing. The day following we reached Oy&s;ter-Bay; &s;everal friends both of Grave&s;end and Flu&s;hing accompany|ing us. The half-year's meeting began next day, which la&s;ted four days. The fir&s;t and &s;econd days we had pub|lick meetings for wor&s;hip, to which people of all &s;orts might and did come. On third-day were the men's and women's meetings, wherein the affairs of the church were taken care of. Here we met with &s;ome bad &s;pirits, who were run out from truth into prejudice, contention, and oppo&s;ition to the order of truth, and to friends therein. The&s;e had been very trouble&s;ome to friends in their meetings, there and there abouts formerly, and it is like would have been &s;o now; but I would not &s;uffer the &s;ervice of our men's and women's meetings to be interrupted and hindered by their cavils. I let them know, <Q>if they had any thing to object again&s;t the order of truth which we were in, we would give them a meeting another day on purpo&s;e.</Q> And indeed I labour|ed the more, and travelled the harder to get to this meeting, where it was expected many of the&s;e contentious people would be; becau&s;e I under&s;tood they had reflected much upon me when I was far from them. The men's and wo|men's meetings being over, on the fourth day we had a meeting with tho&s;e di&s;contented people, to which as many
<PB N="149" REF="037441_0665_100D9281568DCDC0">of them as would did come, and as many friends as had a de&s;ire were pre&s;ent al&s;o; and the Lord's power broke forth gloriou&s;ly, to the confounding of the gain&s;ayers. Then &s;ome, that had been chief in the mi&s;chievous work of con|tention and oppo&s;ition again&s;t the truth, began to fawn up|on me, and ca&s;t the blame upon others; but the deceit&s;ul &s;pirit was judged down and condemned, and the glorious truth of God was exalted and &s;et over all; and they were all brought down and bowed under. Which was of great &s;ervice to truth, and great &s;atisfaction and comfort to friends; glory to the Lord for ever!</P>
<P>After friends were gone to their &s;everal habitations, we &s;taid &s;ome days upon the i&s;land, had meetings in &s;everal parts thereof, and good &s;ervice for the Lord. When we were clear of the i&s;land, we returned to Oy&s;ter-Bay, wait|ing for a wind to carry us to Rhode-I&s;land, computed to be about two hundred miles. As &s;oon as the wind &s;erved we &s;et &s;ail, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rived in Rhode-I&s;land the thirtieth of the third month; where we were gladly received by friends. We went to Nicholas Ea&s;ton's who was governor of the i&s;land; where we lay, being weary with travelling. On fir&s;t-day following we had a large meeting; to which the deputy-governor and &s;everal ju&s;tices came, and were mighti|ly affected with the truth. The week following, the yearly meeting for friends of New-England, and other colonies adjacent, was held in this i&s;land; to which, be&s;ides many friends who lived in tho&s;e parts, came John Stubbs from Barbadoes, and James Lanca&s;ter and John Cartwright from another way. This meeting la&s;ted &s;ix days. The fir&s;t four were &s;pent in general publick meetings for wor&s;hip; to which abundance of other people came. For having no prie&s;ts in the i&s;land, and no re&s;triction to any particular way of wor&s;hip; and the governor and deputy-governor, with &s;everal ju&s;tices of the peace, daily frequenting meet|ings; it &s;o encouraged the people, that they flocked in from all parts of the i&s;land. Very good &s;ervice we had among&s;t them, and truth and good reception. I have rarely ob&s;erv|ed a people, in the &s;tate wherein they &s;tood, to hear with more attention, diligence, and affection, than generally they did, during the four days; which was al&s;o taken notice of by other friends. The&s;e public meetings over, the men's meeting began, which was large, precious, and weighty. The day following was the women's meeting, which al|&s;o was large and very &s;olemn. The&s;e two meetings be|ing
<PB N="150" REF="037441_0666_100D9283438371D0">for ordering the affairs of the church, many weighty things were opened, and communicated to them, by way of advice, information, and in&s;truction in the &s;ervices relating thereunto; that all might be kept clean &s;weet, and &s;avoury among&s;t them. In the&s;e, &s;everal men's and women's meet|ings for other parts were agreed and &s;ettled, to take care of the poor, and other affairs of the church, and to &s;ee that all who profe&s;s truth walk according to the glorious go&s;pel of God. When this great general meeting was ended, it was &s;omewhat hard for friends to part; for the glorious power of the Lord, which was over all, and his ble&s;&s;ed truth and life flowing among&s;t them, had &s;o knit and united them to|gether, that they &s;pent two days in taking leave one of ano|ther, and of the friends of the i&s;land; and then, being mightily filled with the pre&s;ence and power of the Lord, they went away with jovful hearts to their &s;everal habita|tions, in the &s;everal colonies where they lived.</P>
<P>When friends had taken their leave one of another, we, who travelled among&s;t them, di&s;per&s;ed our&s;elves into our &s;everal &s;ervices, as the Lord ordered us. John Burnyeate, John Cartwright, and George Patti&s;on went into the ea&s;t|ern parts of New-England, in company with the friends that came from thence, to vi&s;it the particular meetings there; whom John Stubbs and James Lanca&s;ter intended to follow awhile after, in the &s;ame &s;ervice; but they were not yet clear of this i&s;land. Robert Widders and I &s;taid longer upon this i&s;land; finding &s;ervice &s;till here for the Lord, through the great openne&s;s, and the daily coming in of fre&s;h people from other colonies, for &s;ome time, after the general meeting; &s;o that we had many large and &s;erviceable meetings among them.</P>
<P>During this time, a marriage was celebrated among&s;t friends in this i&s;land, and we were pre&s;ent. It was at a friend's hou&s;e, who had formerly been governor of the i&s;land: and three ju&s;tices of the peace, with many others not in profe&s;&s;ion with us, and friends al&s;o &s;aid, They never &s;aw &s;uch a &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, &s;o weighty a marriage, and &s;o comely an order. Thus truth was &s;et over all. This might &s;erve for an example to others; for there were &s;ome pre&s;ent from many other places.</P>
<P>After this I had a great travail in &s;pirit concerning the Ranters in tho&s;e parts, who had been rude at a meeting which I was not at. Wherefore I appointed a meeting among&s;t them believing the Lord would give me power
<PB N="151" REF="037441_0667_100D92851790D258">over them; which he did, to his prai&s;e and glory, ble&s;&s;ed be his name for ever! There were at this meeting many friends, and divers other people; &s;ome of whom were ju&s;|tices of the peace, and officers, who were generally well af|fected with the truth. One, who had been a ju&s;tice twenty years, was convinced, &s;poke highly of the truth, and more highly of me than is fit for me to mention or take notice of.</P>
<P>We had a meeting at Providence, which was very large, con&s;i&s;ting of many &s;orts of people: I had a great travail up|on my &s;pirit, that it might be pre&s;erved quiet, and that truth might be brought over the people, and might gain en|trance and have place in them; for they were generally above the prie&s;ts, in high notions; and &s;ome came on pur|po&s;e to di&s;pute. But the Lord, whom we waited upon, was with us, his power went over them all; and his ble&s;&s;ed Seed was exalted and &s;et above all. The di&s;puters were &s;ilent, and the meeting quiet, and ended well; prai&s;ed be the Lord! The people went away mightily &s;atisfied, much de&s;iring another meeting. This place (called Providence) was about thirty miles from Rhode-I&s;land; we went to it by water. The governor of Rhode-I&s;land, and many others, went with me thither; and we had the meeting in a great barn, which was thronged with people, &s;o that I was exceeding hot, and in a great &s;weat; but all was well; the glorious power of the Lord &s;hined over all, glory to the great God for ever!</P>
<P>After this we went to Narragan&s;et, about twenty miles from Rhode-I&s;land; and the governor went with us. We had a meeting at a ju&s;tice's, where friends never had any be|fore. The meeting was very large, for the country general|ly came in; and people from Connecticut, and other parts round about. There were four ju&s;tices of peace. Mo&s;t of the&s;e people were &s;uch as had never heard friends before; but they were mightily affected, and a great de&s;ire there is after the truth among&s;t them. So that meeting was of very good &s;ervice; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for ever! The ju&s;tice, at who&s;e hou&s;e it was, and another ju&s;tice of that country, in|vited me to come again; but I was then clear of tho&s;e parts, and was going towards Shelter-i&s;land. John Burnyeate and John Cartwright, being come out of New-England in|to Rhode-I&s;land before I was gone, I laid this place before them, and they felt drawings thither, and went to vi&s;it them. At another place, I heard &s;ome of the magi&s;trates &s;aid among them&s;elves, <Q>If they had money enough, they would hire
<PB N="152" REF="037441_0668_100D928771B86C90">me to be their mini&s;ter.</Q> This was, where they did not well under&s;tand us, and our principles: but when I heard of it, I &s;aid, <Q>It was time for me to be gone; for if their eye was &s;o much to me, or any of us, they would not come to their own teacher.</Q> For this thing (hiring mini&s;ters) had &s;poiled many, by hindering them from improving their own talents; whereas our labour is, to bring every one to their own teacher in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I went from hence towards Shelter-I&s;land, having with me Robert Widders, James Lanca&s;ter, George Parti&s;on, and John Jay, a planter in Barbadoes. We went off in a &s;loop; and pa&s;&s;ing by Point Juda and Block-I&s;land, we came to Fi&s;hers-I&s;land, where at night we went on &s;hore, but were not able to &s;tay for the mu&s;quetoes (a &s;ort of gnats, or little flies) which abound there, and are very trouble|&s;ome. Wherefore we went into our &s;loop again, put off from the &s;hore, ca&s;t anchor, and lay in our &s;loop that night. Next day we went into the Sound, but finding our &s;loop was not able to live in that water, we returned again, and came to anchor before Fi&s;hers-I&s;land, where we lay in our &s;loop that night al&s;o. There fell abundance of rain, and our &s;loop being open, we were exceeding wet. Next day we pa&s;&s;ed over the waters called the Two Hor&s;e Races, and then by Garner's-i&s;land; after which we pa&s;&s;ed by Gull's-i&s;land, and got at length to Shelter-i&s;land, which though it was but about twenty-&s;even leagues from Rhode-i&s;land, through the difficulty of pa&s;&s;age, we were three days in get|ting thither. The day after, being fir&s;t-day, we had a meet|ing there. In the &s;ame week, I had a meeting among the Indians, at which were their king, with his council, and about an hundred Indians more. They &s;at down like friends, and heard very attentively, while I &s;poke to them by an interpreter, an Indian that could &s;peak Engli&s;h well. After the meeting they appeared very loving, and confe&s;&s;ed what was &s;aid to them was truth. The next fir&s;t-day we had a great meeting on the i&s;land, to which many people came who had never heard friends before. They were well &s;atisfied with the meeting, and would not go away when it was done till they had &s;poke with me. I went among&s;t them, and found they were much taken with the truth; good de&s;ires were rai&s;ed in them, and great love. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, his name &s;preads, and will be great among the nations, and dreadful among the heathen.</P>
<P>White we were in Shelter-i&s;land, William Edmund&s;on
<PB N="153" REF="037441_0669_100D9289844FA728">came to us, who had been labouring in the work of the Lord in Virginia. From whence he travelled through the De&s;ert-country, through difficulties and many trials, till he came to Roan-oak, where he met with a tender people. After &s;even weeks &s;ervice in tho&s;e parts, &s;ailing to Maryland, and &s;o to New-York, he came from thence to Long-i&s;land; where we met with him, and were very glad to hear from him the good &s;ervice he had for the Lord in the &s;everal pla|ces where he had travelled &s;ince he parted from us.</P>
<P>We &s;taid not long in Shelter-i&s;land, but entering our &s;loop again, put to &s;ea for Long-i&s;land. We had a very rough pa&s;&s;age; the tide run &s;o &s;trong for &s;everal hours, that I have not &s;een the like; and being again&s;t us, we could hardly get forward though we had a gale. We were upon the water all that day and the night following, but found our|&s;elves next day driven back near Fi&s;her's-i&s;land. For there was a great fog, and towards day it was very dark, &s;o that we could not &s;ee what way we made. Be&s;ides, it rained much in the night, which in our open &s;loop made us very wet. Next day a great &s;torm aro&s;e, &s;o that we were fain to go over the Sound, and did get over with much ado. We pa&s;&s;ed by Faulcon-i&s;land, and came to the Main, where we ca&s;t anchor till the &s;torm was over. Then we cro&s;&s;ed the Sound, all very wet, and much difficulty we had to get to land, the wind being &s;trong again&s;t us. But ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of heaven and earth, and of the &s;eas and waters, all was well. We got &s;afe to Oy&s;ter-bay in Long-I&s;land, the &s;eventh of the &s;ixth month, very early in the morning, which, they &s;ay, is about two hundred miles from Rhode-I&s;land. At Oy&s;ter-bay we had a very large meeting. The &s;ame day James Lanca&s;ter and Chri&s;topher Holder went over the bay to Rye, on the continent, in governor Win|throp's government, and had a meeting there. From Oy&s;ter|bay we pa&s;&s;ed about thirty miles to Flu&s;hing, where we had a very large meeting, many hundreds of people being there; &s;ome of whom came about thirty miles to it. A glorious and heavenly meeting it was (prai&s;ed be the Lord God!) and the people were much &s;atisfied. Meanwhile Chri&s;to|pher Holder and &s;ome other friends went to a town in Long-I&s;land, called Jamaica, and had a meeting there. We pa&s;&s;ed from Flu&s;hing to Grave&s;end, about twenty miles, and there had three precious meetings; to which many would have come from New-York, but that the wea|ther hindered them. Being clear of this place, we hired a
<PB N="154" REF="037441_0670_100D928B77473308">&s;loop, and, the wind &s;erving, &s;et out for the new country now called Jer&s;ey. Pa&s;&s;ing down the bay by Conny-i&s;land, Natton-i&s;land, and Stratton-i&s;land, we came to Richard Hart&s;horn's at Middletown-harbour, about break of day, the twenty-&s;eventh of the &s;ixth month. Next day we rode about thirty miles into that country, through the woods, and over very bad bogs, one wor&s;e than all the re&s;t; the de&s;cent into which was &s;o &s;teep that we were fain to &s;lide down with our hor&s;es, and then let them lie and breathe them&s;elves before they could go on. This place the peo|ple of the country called Purgatory. We got at length to Shrew&s;bury, in Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey, and on fir&s;t-day had a precious meeting there; to which friends and other people came far, and the ble&s;&s;ed pre&s;ence of the Lord was with us. The &s;ame week we had a men's and women's meeting out of mo&s;t parts of New-Jer&s;ey. They are building a meeting-place in the mid&s;t of them, and there is a monthly and general meeting &s;et up, which will be of great &s;ervice in tho&s;e parts, in <Q>keeping up the go&s;pel-order, and govern|ment of Chri&s;t Je&s;us (of the increa&s;e of which there is no end) that they who are faithful may &s;ee that all who pro|fe&s;s the holy truth live in the pure religion, and walk as 'becometh the go&s;pel.</Q></P>
<P>While we were at Shrew&s;bury, an accident be&s;el, which for the time was a great exerci&s;e to us; John Jay, a friend of Barbadoes, who came with us from Rhode-I&s;land, and intended to accompany us through the Woods to Mary|land, being to try a hor&s;e, got upon his back, and the hor&s;e fell a running, ca&s;t him down upon his head, and broke his neck, as the people &s;aid. Tho&s;e that were near him took him up as dead, carried him a good way, and laid him on a tree. I got to him as &s;oon as I could; and, feeling him, con|cluded he was dead. As I &s;tood pitying him and his fa|mily, I took hold of his hair, and his head turned any way, his neck was &s;o limber. Whereupon I took his head in both my hands, and &s;etting my knees again&s;t the tree, I rai&s;ed his head, and perceived there was nothing out or broken that way. Then I put one hand under his chin, and the other behind his head, and rai&s;ed his head two or three times with all my &s;trength, and brought it in. I &s;oon perceived his neck began to grow &s;tiff again, and then he began to rattle in his throat, and quickly after to breathe. The people were amazed; but I bade them have a good heart, be of good faith, and carry him into the hou&s;e. They
<PB N="155" REF="037441_0671_100D928D0C22E730">did &s;o, and &s;et him by the fire. I bid them get him &s;ome|thing warm to drink, and put him to bed. After he had been in the hou&s;e awhile, he began to &s;peak; but did not know where he had been. The next day we pa&s;&s;ed away (and he with us, pretty well) about &s;ixteen miles, to a meet|ing at Middletown, through woods and bogs, and over a river; where we &s;wam our hor&s;es, and got over our&s;elves upon a hollow tree. Many hundred miles did he travel with us after this.</P>
<P>To this meeting came mo&s;t of the people of the town. A glorious meeting we had, and the truth was over all; ble&s;&s;ed be the great Lord God for ever! After the meeting we went to Middle-town-harbour, about five miles, in or|der to take our long journey next morning, through the woods towards Maryland, having hired Indians for our guides. I determined to pa&s;s through the woods, on the other &s;ide of Delaware-bay, that we might head the creeks and rivers as much as po&s;&s;ible. The ninth of the &s;eventh month we &s;et forward, pa&s;&s;ed through many Indian towns, and over &s;ome rivers and bogs. When we had rid about forty miles, we made a fire at night, and lay by it. As we came among the Indians, we declared the day of the Lord to them. Next day we travelled fifty miles, as we comput|ed; and at night finding an old hou&s;e, which the Indians had forced the people to leave, we made a fire, and lay there, at the head of Delaware-bay. The next day we &s;wam our hor&s;es over a river about a mile, at twice, fir&s;t to an i&s;land called Upper-Dinidock, and then to the main land, having hired Indians to help us over in their canoes. This day we could reach but about thirty miles, and came to a Swede's hou&s;e, where we got a little &s;traw, and lay that night. Next day, having hired another guide, we travelled about forty miles through the woods, and made a fire at night, by which we lay, and dried our&s;elves; for we were often wet in our travels. Next day we pa&s;&s;ed over a de&s;|perate river, which had in it many rocks and broad &s;tones, very hazardous to us and our hor&s;es. From thence we came to Chri&s;tian-river, where we &s;wam our hor&s;es over, and went our&s;elves in canoes; but the &s;ides of the river were &s;o miry, that &s;ome of the hor&s;es had like to have been laid up. From thence we came to New-Ca&s;tle, heretofore called New-Am&s;terdam; and being very weary, and inquir|ing in the town where we might buy &s;ome corn for our hor&s;es, the governor came and invited me to his hou&s;e, and
<PB N="156" REF="037441_0672_100D928F15E51E28">afterwards de&s;ired me to lodge there; telling me, he had a bed for me, and I &s;hould be welcome. So I &s;taid, the other friends being taken care of al&s;o. This was on a &s;eventh day, and he offering his hou&s;e for a meeting, we had the next day a pretty large one; for mo&s;t of the town were at it. Here had never been a mecting before, nor any within a great way; but this was a very precious one, many were tender, and confe&s;&s;ed to the truth, and &s;ome received it; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for ever!</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth of the &s;eventh month we &s;et forward, and travelled, as near as we could compute, about fifty miles, through the woods and over the bogs, heading Bohemia-river and Sa&s;&s;afras-river. At night we made a fire in the woods, and lay there all night. It being rainy weather, we got un|der &s;ome thick trees for &s;helter, and afterwards dried our|&s;elves again by the fire. Next day we waded through Che&s;ter-river, a very broad water, and afterwards pa&s;&s;ing through many bad bogs, lay that night al&s;o in the woods by a fire, not having gone above thirty miles that day. The day following we travelled hard, though we had &s;ome trouble&s;ome bogs in our way; we rode about fifty miles, and got &s;afe that night to Robert Harwood's, at Miles-river in Maryland. This was the eighteenth of the &s;eventh month; and though we were very weary, and much dirtied with the bogs, yet hearing of a meeting next day, we went to it, and from it to John Edmund&s;on's; from whence we went three or four miles by water to a meeting on the fir&s;t-day following. Here was a judge's wife, who had never been at any of our meetings before, who was reached, and &s;aid after the meeting, <Q>She had rather hear us once, than the prie&s;ts a thou&s;and times.</Q> Many others al&s;o were well &s;atisfied; for the power of the Lord was eminently with us. Ble&s;&s;ed for ever be his holy name! We pa&s;&s;ed from thence about twenty-two miles, and had a good meeting upon the Kenti&s;h &s;hore, to which one of the judges came. After ano|ther good meeting hard-by at William Wilcock's, where we had good &s;ervice for the Lord, we went by water about twenty miles to a very large meeting, where were &s;ome hun|dreds of people, and four ju&s;tices of peace, the high-&s;heriff of Delaware, and others from thence; there was an Indian emperor or governor, and two others of the chief men among the Indians. With the&s;e Indians I had a good opportuni|ty. I &s;poke to them by an interpreter: they heard the truth attentively; and were very loving. A ble&s;&s;ed meeting
<PB N="157" REF="037441_0673_100D9291D0064F68">this was, of great &s;ervice both for convincing, and e&s;tabli&s;h|ing in the truth tho&s;e that were convinced of it. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who cau&s;eth his ble&s;&s;ed truth to &s;pread! After the meeting a woman came to me, who&s;e hu&s;band was one of the judges of that country, and a member of the a&s;&s;embly there. She told me, <Q>Her hu&s;band was &s;ick, not likely to live, and de&s;ired me to go home with her to &s;ee him.</Q> It was three miles to her hou&s;e, and I being ju&s;t come hot out of the meeting, it was hard for me then to go; yet con&s;idering the &s;ervice, I got an hor&s;e, went with her, vi&s;ited her hu&s;band, and &s;poke what the Lord gave me to him. The man was much refre&s;hed, and finely rai&s;ed up by the power of the Lord; and afterwards came to our meetings. I went back to the friends that night, and next day we departed thence about nineteen or twenty miles to Tredhaven-creek, to John Edmund&s;on's again; from whence, the third of the eighth month, we went to the general meeting for all Maryland friends.</P>
<P>This meeting held five days. The fir&s;t three we had meetings for publick wor&s;hip, to which people of all &s;orts came; the other two were &s;pent in the men's and women's meetings. To tho&s;e publick meetings came many Prote&s;|tants of divers &s;orts, and &s;ome Papi&s;ts; among&s;t whom were &s;everal magi&s;trates and their wives, with other per&s;ons of chief account in the country. Of the common people, it was thought there were &s;ometimes a thou&s;and at one of tho&s;e meetings; &s;o that though they had enlarged their meeting-place, and made it as big again as it was before, it could not contain the people. I went by boat every day four or five miles to the meeting, and there were &s;o many boats at that time pa&s;&s;ing upon the river, that it was almo&s;t like the Thames. The people &s;aid, <Q>There were never &s;o many boats &s;een there together before;</Q> and one of the ju&s;tices &s;aid, <Q>He never &s;aw &s;o many people together in that country.</Q> It was a very heavenly meeting, wherein the pre&s;ence of the Lord was gloriou&s;ly manife&s;ted, friends were &s;weetly refre&s;hed, the people generally &s;atisfied, and many convinced; for the ble&s;&s;ed power of the Lord was over all: everla&s;ting prai&s;es to his holy name for ever! Af|ter the publick meetings were over, the men's and women's began, and were held the other two days; for I had &s;ome|thing to impart to them, which concerned the glory of God, the order of the go&s;pel, and the government of Chri&s;t Je|&s;us. When the&s;e meetings were over, we took our leave of
<PB N="158" REF="037441_0674_100D929361B739C0">friends in tho&s;e parts, whom we left well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the truth. The tenth of the eighth month we went about thirty miles by water, pa&s;&s;ing by Cranes-i&s;land, Swan-i&s;land, and Kent-i&s;land, in very foul weather and much rain; whereby, our boat being open, we were not only very much wetted, but in great danger of being over&s;et; in&s;omuch that &s;ome thought we could not have e&s;caped being ca&s;t away, till they &s;aw us come to &s;hore next morning. But ble&s;&s;ed be God, we were very well. Having got to a little hou&s;e, dried our cloaths by the fire; and refre&s;hed our&s;elves a little, we took to our boat again, and put off from land, &s;ome|times &s;ailing, and &s;ometimes rowing; but having very foul weather, we could not get above twelve miles forward. At night we got to land, made us a &s;ire, by which &s;ome lay, and others by a &s;ire at a hou&s;e a little way off. Next morn|ing we pa&s;&s;ed over the Great-bay, and &s;ailed about forty miles that day. Making to &s;hore at night, we lay there, &s;ome in the boat, and &s;ome at an alehou&s;e. Next morn|ing being fir&s;t-day, we went &s;ix or &s;even miles to a friend's hou&s;e, a ju&s;tice of the peace; where we had a meeting. This was a little above the head of the Great-bay. We were almo&s;t four days upon water, weary with rowing, yet all was very well; ble&s;&s;ed and prai&s;ed be the Lord! We went next day to another friend's over the head of Hatton's|i&s;land, where we had good &s;ervice; as we had al&s;o the day following at George Wil&s;on's, a friend, that lived about three miles further, where we had a very precious meeting, there being great tenderne&s;s among&s;t the people.</P>
<P>After this we &s;ailed about ten miles to James Frizby's, a ju&s;tice of peace; where, the &s;ixteenth of the eighth month, we had a very large meeting, at which, be&s;ides friends, were &s;ome hundreds of people, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed. Among&s;t them were &s;everal ju&s;tices, captains, and the &s;heriff, with other per&s;ons of note. A ble&s;&s;ed heavenly meeting this was; a powerful, thundering te&s;timony for truth was borne therein; a great &s;en&s;e there was upon the people, and much brokenne&s;s and tenderne&s;s among&s;t them. We &s;taid till about the eleventh hour in the night, that the tide turned for us; then taking boat, we pa&s;&s;ed that night and the next day about fifty miles to another; friend's hou&s;e. The two next days we made &s;hort journies, vi&s;iting friends. The twentieth we had a great meeting at a place called Severn, where there was a meeting-place, but not large enough to hold the people. Divers chief magi&s;trates were at it, with
<PB N="159" REF="037441_0675_100D9294F40D7468">many other con&s;iderable people, and it gave them generally great &s;atisfaction. Two days after we had a meeting with &s;ome that walked di&s;orderly, and had good &s;ervice in it. Then &s;pending a day or two in vi&s;iting friends, we pa&s;&s;ed to the We&s;tern-&s;hore, and the twenty-fifth had a large and precious meeting at William Coale's, where the &s;peaker of their a&s;&s;embly, with his wife, a ju&s;tice of peace, and &s;everal people of quality, were pre&s;ent. Next day we had a meet|ing, &s;ix or &s;even miles further, at Abraham Birkhead's, where many of the magi&s;trates and upper &s;ort were; and the &s;peaker of the a&s;&s;embly for that country was convinced. A ble&s;&s;ed meeting it was; prai&s;ed be the Lord! We tra|velled next day; and the day following, the twenty-eighth, of the eighth month, had a large and very precious meeting at Peter Sharp's, on the Clifts, between thirty and forty miles di&s;tant from the former. Many of the magi&s;trates and upper rank of people were pre&s;ent, and a heavenly meeting it was. One of the governor's council's wives was con|vinced; and her hu&s;band was very loving to friends. A ju&s;tice of peace from Virginia was convinced, and hath a meeting &s;ince at his hou&s;e. Some Papi&s;ts were at this meet|ing, one of whom threatened, before he came, to di&s;pute with me; but he was reached, and could not oppo&s;e. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, the truth reached into the hearts of people beyond words, and it is of a good &s;avour among&s;t them! After the meeting we went about eighteen miles to James Pre&s;ton's, a friend that lived on Patuxent River. Thither came an Indian king, with his brother, to whom I &s;poke, and I found they under&s;tood the thing I &s;poke of. Having fini&s;hed our &s;ervice in Maryland, and intending for Virginia, we had a meeting at Patuxent the fourth of the ninth month, to take our leave of friends. Many people of all &s;orts were at it, and a powerful meeting it was.</P>
<P>The fifth of the ninth month we &s;et &s;ail for Virginia, and in three days came to Nancemum, about two hundred miles from Maryland. In this voyage we met with foul weather, &s;torms, and rain, and lay in the woods by a fire in the night. Here lived a friend, called the widow Wright. Next day we had a great meeting at Nancemum, of friends and others. There came to this meeting colonel Dewes, with &s;everal other officers and magi&s;trates, who were much taken with the declaration of truth. After the meeting, we ha&s;tened towards Carolina; yet had &s;everal meetings by the way, wherein we had good &s;ervice for the Lord: one about
<PB N="160" REF="037441_0676_100D929773117C80">four miles from Nancemum Water, which was very pre|cious; and there was a men's and a women's meeting &s;et|tled, for the affairs of the church. Another very good meet|ing we had at William Yarrow's, at Pagan Creek; which was &s;o large that we were fain to be abroad, the hou&s;e not being big enough to contain the people. A great openne&s;s there was, the &s;ound of truth &s;pread abroad, and had a good &s;avour in the hearts of people: the Lord have the glory for ever!</P>
<P>After this, our way to Carolina grew wor&s;e, being much of it pla&s;hy, and pretty full of great bogs and &s;wamps; &s;o that we were commonly wet to the knees, and lay abroad a-nights in the woods by a fire: &s;aving one of the nights we got to a poor hou&s;e at Sommertown, and lay by the fire. The woman of the hou&s;e had a &s;en&s;e of God upon her. The report of our travel had reached thither, and drawn &s;ome that lived beyond Sommertown to that hou&s;e, in ex|pectation to have &s;een and heard us; but they mi&s;&s;ed us. Next day, the twenty-fir&s;t of the ninth month, having tra|velled hard through the woods, and over many bogs and &s;wamps, we reached Bonner's Creek; there we lay that night by the fire-&s;ide the woman lending us a mat to lie on.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t hou&s;e we came to in Carolina: here we left our hor&s;es, over-wearied with travel. From hence we went down the creek in a canoe to Macocomocock Ri|ver, and came to Hugh Smith's where people of other profe&s;&s;ions came to &s;ee us (no friends inhabiting that part of the country) and many of them received us gladly. Among&s;t others, came Nathaniel Batts, who had been go|vernor of Roanoak. He went by the name of captain Batts, and had been a rude, de&s;perate man. He a&s;ked me about a woman in Cumberland, who, he &s;aid, he was told, had been healed by our prayers and laying on of hands, after &s;he had been long &s;ick, and given over by the phy&s;i|cians: he de&s;ired to know the certainty of it. I told him, we did not glory in &s;uch things, but many &s;uch things had been done by the power of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Not far from hence we had a meeting among the people, and they were taken with the truth; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord! Then pa&s;&s;ing down the river Maratick in a canoe, we went down the bay Connie-oak, to a captain's, who was loving to us, and lent us his boat (for we were much wetted in the canoe, the water fla&s;hing in upon us.) With this boat we went to the governor's; but the water in &s;ome places was
<PB N="161" REF="037441_0677_100D929BB7251890">&s;o &s;hallow, that the boat, being loaden, could not &s;wim; &s;o that we put off our &s;hoes and &s;tockings, and waded through the water a pretty way. The governor, with his wife, re|ceived us lovingly; but a doctor there would needs di&s;pute with us. And truly his oppo&s;ing us was of good &s;ervice, giving occa&s;ion for the opening of many things to the people concerning the Light and Spirit of God, which he denied to be in every one; and affirmed it was not in the Indians. Whereupon I called an Indian to us, and a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether or no, when he did lie, or do wrong to any one, there was not &s;omething in him that did reprove him for it?</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>There was &s;uch a thing in him, that did &s;o reprove him; and he was a&s;hamed when he had done wrong, or &s;poken wrong.</Q> So we &s;hamed the doctor be|fore the governor and people; in&s;omuch that the poor man ran out &s;o far, that at length he would not own the &s;crip|tures. We tarried at the governor's that night; and next morning he very courteou&s;ly walked with us him&s;elf about two miles through the woods, to a place whither he had &s;ent our boat about to meet us. Taking leave of him, we en|tered our boat, and went about thirty miles to Jo&s;eph Scot's, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the repre&s;entatives of the country. There we had a &s;ound, precious meeting; the people were tender, and much de&s;ired after meetings. Wherefore at an hou&s;e about four miles further, we had another meeting; to which the gover|nor's &s;ecretary came, who was chief &s;ecretary of the pro|vince, and had been formerly convinced.</P>
<P>I went from this place among the Indians, and &s;poke to them by an interpreter, &s;hewing them, <Q>That God made all things in &s;ix days, and made but one woman for one man; and that God did drown the old world becau&s;e of their wickedne&s;s. Afterwards I &s;poke to them concerning Chri&s;t, &s;hewing them, that he died for all men, for their &s;ins, as well as for others; and had enlightened them as well as others; and that if they did that which was evil he would burn them; but if they did well they &s;hould not be burn|ed.</Q> There was among them their young king and others of their chief men, who &s;eemed to receive kindly what I &s;aid to them.</P>
<P>Having vi&s;ited the north part of Carolina, and made a little entrance for truth upon the people there, we began to return again towards Virginia, having &s;everal meetings in our way, wherein we had good &s;ervice for the Lord, the people being generally tender and open; ble&s;&s;ed be the
<PB N="162" REF="037441_0678_100D929E02BB7A68">Lord! We lay one night at the &s;cretary's, to which we had much ado to get; for the water being &s;hallow, we could not bring our boat to &s;hore. But the &s;ecretary's wife, &s;ee|ing our &s;trait, came her&s;elf in a canoe (her hu&s;band be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng from home) and brought us to land. By next morning ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> boat was &s;unk, and full of water; but we got her up, mend|ed her, and went away in her that day about twenty-four miles, the water being rough, and the winds high: but the great power of God was &s;een, in carrying us &s;afe in that rot|ten boat. In our return we had a very precious meeting at Hugh Smith's; prai&s;ed be the Lord for ever! The people were very tender, and very good &s;ervice we had among&s;t them. There was at this meeting an Indian captain, who was very loving; and acknowledged it to be truth that was &s;poken. There was al&s;o one of the Indian prie&s;t, whom they called a Pauwaw, who &s;at &s;oberly among the people. The ninth of the tenth month we got back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Bonner's-Creek, where we had left our hor&s;es; having &s;pent about eighteen days in the north of Carolina.</P>
<P>Our hor&s;es having re&s;ted, we &s;et forward for Virginia again, travelling through the woods and bogs as far as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> could well reach that day, and at night lay by a fire in the woods. Next day we had a tedious journey through bogs and &s;wamps, and were exceeding wet and dirty all the day, but dried our&s;elves at night by a fire. We got that night to Sommertown. When we came near the hou&s;e, the woman of the hou&s;e &s;eeing us, &s;poke to her &s;on to keep up their dogs (for both in Virginia and Carolina they generally keep great dogs to guard their hou&s;es, living lonely in the woods) but the &s;on &s;aid, <Q>He need not, for their dogs did not u&s;e to meddle with the&s;e people.</Q> Whereupon, when we were come into the hou&s;e, &s;he told us. <Q>We were like the chil|dren of I&s;rael, whom the dogs did not move their tongues again&s;t.</Q> Here we lay in our cloaths by the fire, as we had done many a night before. Next day we had a meet|ing; for the people, having been informed of us, had a great de&s;ire to hear us; and a very good meeting we had among them, where we never had one before: prai&s;ed be the Lord for ever! After the meeting we ha&s;ted away. When we had rid about twenty miles, calling at a hou&s;e to enquire the way, the people de&s;ired us to tarry all night with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem: which we did. Next day we came among friends, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we had travelled about an hundred miles from Caroline into Virginia: in which time we ob&s;erved great variety of cli|mates,
<PB N="163" REF="037441_0679_100D929FD208DDF8">having pa&s;&s;ed in a few days from a very cold to a warm and &s;pring-like country. But the power of the Lord is the &s;ame in all; is over all, and doth reach the good in all; prai&s;ed be the Lord for ever!</P>
<P>We &s;pent about three weeks in travelling through Vir|ginia mo&s;tly among&s;t friends, having large and precious meetings in &s;everal parts of the country; as at the widow Wright's, where many of the magi&s;trates, officers, and other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igh people came. A mo&s;t heavenly meeting we had; wherein the power of the Lord was &s;o great, that it &s;truck a dread upon the a&s;&s;embly, chained all down, and brought reverence upon the people's minds. Among the officers was a major, kin&s;man to the prie&s;t, who told me, <Q>The prie&s;t threatened to come and oppo&s;e us.</Q> But the Lord's power was too &s;trong for him, and &s;topped him, and we were quiet and peaceable. The people were wonderfully affected with the te&s;timony of truth; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for ever! Another very good meeting we had at Cricka|trough, at which many con&s;iderable people were, who had never heard a friend before; and they were greatly &s;atisfied, prai&s;ed be the Lord! We had al&s;o a very good and &s;er|viceable meeting at John Porter's, which con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;tly of other people, in which the power of the Lord was glori|ou&s;ly &s;een and felt, and it brought the truth over all the bad walkers and talkers; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord! Divers other meetings we had, and many opportunities of &s;ervice for the Lord among&s;t the people where we came. The la&s;t week that we &s;taid we &s;pent &s;ome time and pains among friends, &s;weeping away that which was to be &s;wept out, and work|ing down a bad &s;pirit that was got up in &s;ome: and ble&s;&s;ed for ever be the name of the Lord! he it is that gives victory over all.</P>
<P>Having &s;ini&s;hed what &s;ervice lay upon us at Virginia, the thirtieth of the tenth month we &s;et &s;ail in an open &s;loop for Maryland. But having a great &s;torm, and being much wetted, we were glad to get to &s;hore before night; and, walking to an hou&s;e at Willoughby-Point, we got lodging there that night. The woman of the hou&s;e was a widow, a very tender per&s;on. She had never received friends be|fore; but &s;he received us very kindly, with tears in her eyes. We returned to our boat in the morning, and hoi&s;ied &s;ail, getting forward as fa&s;t as we could; but towards evening a &s;torm ri&s;ing, the wind being high, we had much ado to get to &s;hore; and our boat being open, the water &s;ta&s;hed often
<PB N="164" REF="037441_0680_100D92A36A70C6D0">in, and &s;ometimes over us, &s;o that we were &s;ufficiently wet|ted. Being got to land, we made a fire in the woods, to warm and dry us; and there we lay all that night, the wolves howling about us. The fir&s;t of the eleventh month we &s;ailed again, but the wind being again&s;t us, we made but little way; and were fain to get to &s;hore at Point-Comfort, where yet we found but &s;mall comfort; for the weather was &s;o cold, that though we made a good fire in the woods to lie by, our water that we had got for u&s;e was frozen near the fire-&s;ide. We made to &s;ea next day; but the wind be|ing &s;trong again&s;t us, we advanced but little; and were glad to get to land again, and travel about to find &s;ome hou&s;e where we might buy provi&s;ions, for our &s;tore was &s;pent. That night al&s;o we lay in the woods; &s;o extreme cold was the weather, the wind blowing high, and the fro&s;t and &s;now great, that it was hard for &s;ome to abide it. The third of the eleventh month, the wind &s;etting pretty fair, we fetch|ed it up by &s;ailing and rowing, and got to Milford-Haven, where we lay at Richard Long's near Quince's-I&s;land. Next day we pa&s;&s;ed by Rappahannock-river, where dwell much people; and friends had a meeting there-away at a ju&s;tice's, who had formerly been at a meeting where I was. We pa&s;&s;ed over Powtomack-river al&s;o, the winds being high, the water very rough, the weather extreme cold; and having a meeting there-away, &s;ome were convinced; and when we parted thence, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me of our company went among&s;t them. We &s;teered our cour&s;e for Patuxent-river. I &s;at at the helm mo&s;t part of the day, and &s;ome of the night. About the fir&s;t hour in the morning we reached James Pre&s;ton's on Patuxent-river, which is accounted about two hundred miles from Nancemum in Virginia. We were very weary; yet the next day, being the fir&s;t of the week, we went to the meeting not far from thence. The &s;ame week we went to an Indian king's cabin, where &s;everal Indians were, with whom we had a pretty opportunity to di&s;cour&s;e, and they carried them&s;elves very lovingly. We went al&s;o that week to a general meeting; from thence about eight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en miles fur|ther to John Geary's, where we had a very precious meet|ing; prai&s;ed be the Lord God for ever! After this the cold grew &s;o exceeding &s;harp, &s;uch extreme fro&s;t and &s;nowy wea|ther beyond what was u&s;ual in that country, that we could hardly endure to be in it. Neither was it ea&s;y or &s;afe to &s;tir abroad: yet we got with &s;ome difficulty &s;ix miles through the &s;now to John Mayor's, where we met with &s;ome friends
<PB N="165" REF="037441_0681_100D92A654486DB8">that were come from New-England, whom we had left there when we came away; and glad we were to &s;ee each other, after &s;uch long and tedious travels. By the&s;e friends we under&s;tood William Edmund&s;on, having been at Rhode-I&s;land and New-England, was gone from thence for Ire|land; that Solomon Eccles coming from Jamaica, and landing at Bo&s;ton in New-England, was taken at a meeting there, and bani&s;hed to Barbado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, that John Stubbs and another friend were gone into New-Jer&s;ey, and &s;everal other friends to Barbadoes, Jamaica, and the Leeward I&s;lands. It was matter of joy to us to under&s;tand the work of the Lord went on and pro&s;pered, and that friends were un|wearied and diligent in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The twenty-&s;eventh of the eleventh month we had a very precious meeting in a tobacco-hou&s;e. The next day we returned to James Pre&s;ton's, about eighteen miles di&s;tant. When we came there, we found his hou&s;e was burnt down to the ground the night before, through the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of a maid &s;ervant; &s;o we lay three nights on the ground by the fire, the weather being very cold. We made an ob&s;erva|tion which was &s;omewhat &s;trange, but certainly true; that one day in the mid&s;t of this cold weather, the wind turning into the &s;outh, it grew &s;o hot, that we could hardly bear the heat; and the next day and night, the wind chopping back into the north, we could hardly endure the cold.</P>
<P>The &s;econd of the twelfth month we had a glorious meet|ing at Patuxent; and after it went to John Geary's again, where we waited for a boat to carry us to the monthly meet|ing at the Clifts; to which we went, and a living meeting it was; prai&s;ed be the Lord! This was on the &s;ixth of the twelfth month. Another meeting we had on the ninth, wherein the glory of the Lord &s;hined over all; ble&s;&s;ed and magnified be his holy name for ever!</P>
<P>The twelfth of the twelfth month we &s;et forward in our boat, and, travelling by night, we run our boat on ground in a creek near Manaco River. There we were fain to &s;tay till morning, that the tide came and lifted her off. In the meantime &s;itting in an open boat, and the weather being bitter cold, &s;ome had like to have lo&s;t the u&s;e of their hands, they were &s;o frozen and benumbed. In the morn|ing, when the tide &s;et our boat a-float, we got to land, and made a good fire, at which we warmed our&s;elves well, and then took boat and pa&s;&s;ed about ten miles farther to a friend's hou&s;e, where next day we had a very precious
<PB N="166" REF="037441_0682_100D92A7E4CC22B0">meeting, at which &s;ome of the chief of the place were. I went after the meeting to a friend's about four miles off, at the head of Aname&s;&s;y River, where the day following the judge of the country and a ju&s;tice with him came to me, and were very loving, and much &s;atisfied with friends or|der. The next day we had a large meeting at the ju&s;tice's in his barn, for his hou&s;e could not hold the company. There were &s;everal of the great folks of that country, and among the re&s;t an oppo&s;er; but all was pre&s;erved quiet and well. A precious meeting it was; the people were much affected with the truth; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord! We went next day to &s;ee captain Colburn, a ju&s;tice of peace, and there we had &s;ome &s;ervice. Then returning again, we had a very glorious meeting at the ju&s;tices where we met before, to which came many people of account in the world, ma|gi&s;trates, officers, and others. It was a large meeting, and the power of the Lord was much felt, &s;o that the people were generally well &s;atisfied and taken with the truth; and there being &s;everal merchants and ma&s;ters of &s;hips from New-England, the truth was &s;pread abroad; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord!</P>
<P>A day or two after we travelled about &s;ixteen miler through the woods and bogs heading Aname&s;&s;y River and Amoroca River, part of which we went over in a canoe, and came to Manaoke, to a friendly woman's hou&s;e, where on the twenty-fourth of the twelfth month we had a large meeting in a barn. The Lord's living pre&s;ence was with us and among the people; ble&s;&s;ed be his holy name for ever|more! Friends never had a meeting in tho&s;e parts before. After this, we pa&s;&s;ed over the river Wicocomaco, and through many bad watery &s;wamps and mar&s;hy way, and came to James Jones's, a friend and a ju&s;tice of the peace, where we had a large and very glorious meeting; prai&s;ed be the Lord God! Then pa&s;&s;ing over the water in a boat, we took hor&s;e, and travelled about twenty-four miles through woods and trouble&s;ome &s;wamps, and came to another ju&s;|tice's hou&s;e, where we had a very large meeting much peo|ple and many of con&s;iderable account being pre&s;ent; and the living pre&s;ence of the Lord was among&s;t us; prai&s;ed for ever be his holy name! This was the third of the fir&s;t month 1672-3. The fifth of the &s;ame we had another living and heavenly meeting, at which divers ju&s;tices with their wives and many others were; among&s;t whom we had very good &s;ervice for the Lord; ble&s;&s;ed be his holy name!
<PB N="167" REF="037441_0683_100D92AA335EECB8">At this meeting was a woman that lived at Aname&s;&s;y, who had been many years in trouble of mind, and &s;ometimes would &s;it moping near two months together, and hardly &s;peak or mind any thing. When I heard of her, I was moved of the Lord to go to her, and tell her, <Q>That &s;al|vation was come to her hou&s;e.</Q> After I had &s;poken the word of life to her, and intreated the Lord for her, &s;he mended, went up and down with us to meetings, and is &s;ince well ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord!</P>
<P>We left Aname&s;&s;y the &s;eventh of the fir&s;t month; and pa&s;&s;ing by water about fifty miles, came to a friendly wo|man's hou&s; at Hunger River. We had very rough wea|ther in our pa&s;&s;age to this place, and were in great danger, for the boat had like to have been turned over. But through the good providence of God we got &s;afe thither; prai&s;ed be hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> name! At this place we had a meeting. Among&s;t the people were two Papi&s;ts, a man and a wo|man; the man was very tender, and the woman confe&s;&s;ed to the truth. I had no friend with me but Robert Wid|ders, the re&s;t having di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves into &s;everal parts of the country in the &s;ervice of truth.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the wind would permit, we pa&s;&s;ed from hence about forty miles by water, rowing mo&s;t part of the way, and came to the head of Little Choptanck River, to Dr. Win&s;more's, a ju&s;tice of peace, lately convinced. Here we met with &s;ome friends, with whom we &s;taid awhile, and then went on by land and water, and had a large meeting abroad, for the hou&s;e we were at could not receive the peo|ple. Divers of the magi&s;trates and their wives were pre|&s;ent; and a good meeting it was; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who is making his name known in that wilderne&s;s country! We went from thence to William Stephens's, where we met with tho&s;e friends that had been travelling in other parts; and were much refre&s;hed in the Lord together, when we imparted to each other the good &s;ucce&s;s we had in the Lord's work, and the pro&s;perity and &s;preading of truth in the pla|ces where we travelled. John Cartwright and another friend had been at irginia, where were great de&s;ires in people after the truth; and being now returned, they &s;taid a little with us here, and then &s;et forward for Barbadoes. Before we left this place, we had a very glorious meeting, at which were many people; among&s;t others, the judge of that coun|try, three ju&s;tices of the peace, and the high-&s;heriff, with their wives. Of the Indians, was one called their emperor,
<PB N="168" REF="037441_0684_100D92ACD7D5CE80">an Indian king, and their &s;peaker, who &s;at very attentive, and carried them&s;elves very lovingly. An e&s;tabli&s;hing, &s;et|tling meeting it was. This was the twenty-third of the fir&s;t month.</P>
<P>The twenty-fourth we went by water ten miles to the In|dian town where this emperor dwelt; whom I had ac|quainted before with my coming, and de&s;ired to get their kings and councils together. In the morning the emperor came him&s;elf, and had me to the town; where they were generally come together, their &s;peaker and other officers be|ing with them, and the old empre&s;s &s;at among them. They &s;at very grave and &s;ober, and were all very attentive, be|yond many called Chri&s;tians. I had &s;ome with me that could interpret to them. We had a very good meeting with them, and of con&s;iderable &s;ervice it was; for it gave them a good e&s;teem of truth and friends; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord!</P>
<P>After this we had meetings in &s;everal parts of that coun|try; one at William Stephens's, which was a general meeting once a month; another at Tredhaven Creek, another at Wye, another at Reconow Creek, and another at Thomas Taylor's in the i&s;land of Kent. Mo&s;t of the&s;e were large, there being many people at them, and divers of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the world's account. The Lord's power and living pre&s;ence was with us, and plenteou&s;ly manife&s;ted among&s;t the people, by which their hearts were tendered, and opened to receive the truth, which had a good &s;avour among&s;t them; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God over all for ever! Being clear of that &s;ide, we pa&s;&s;ed over the bay about four|teen miles to a friend's hou&s;e, where we met with &s;everal friends. I &s;ent for Thomas Thur&s;ton thither, and had a meeting with him, to bring the truth over his bad actions.</P>
<P>Having travelled through mo&s;t parts of that country, and vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the plantations, having alarmed people of all &s;orts where we came, and proclaimed the day of God's &s;alvation among&s;t them, we found our &s;pirits began to be clear of tho&s;e parts of the world, and to draw towards Old England again. Yet we were de&s;irous and felt freedom from the Lord to &s;tay till the general meeting for the pro|vince of Maryland was over (which drew nigh) that we might &s;ee friends generally together before we departed. Wherefore &s;pending our time in the interim in vi&s;iting friends and friendly people, in attending meetings about the Clifts and Patuxent, in writing an&s;wers to &s;ome cavilling objections which adver&s;aries had rai&s;ed and &s;pread abroad
<PB N="169" REF="037441_0685_100D92AED846DFD0">to hinder people from receiving the truth; we were not idle, but laboured in the work of the Lord until that general pro|vincial meeting, which began the &s;eventeenth of the third month, and la&s;ted four days. The fir&s;t of the&s;e days the men and women had their meetings for bu&s;ine&s;s, wherein the affairs of the church were taken care of, and many things relating thereto were opened to their edification and comfort. The other three days were &s;pent in publick meetings for the wor&s;hip of God, at which divers of con|&s;iderable account in the government, and many others were pre&s;ent; who were generally &s;atisfied, and many of them reached; for it was a wonderful glorious meeting, and the mighty pre&s;ence of the Lord was &s;een and felt over all; ble&s;&s;ed and prai&s;ed be his holy name for ever, who over all giveth dominion!</P>
<P>After this meeting we took our leave of friends, parting in great tenderne&s;s, in the &s;en&s;e of the heavenly life and virtuous power of the Lord that was livingly felt among&s;t us, and went by water to the place where we were to take &s;hipping; many friends accompanying us thither and tar|rying with us that night. Next day, the twenty-fir&s;t of the third month, 1673, we &s;et &s;ail for England: the &s;ame day Richard Covell came on board our &s;hip, his own being taken from him by the Dutch. We had foul weather and contrary winds, which cau&s;ed us to ca&s;t anchor often, &s;o that we were till the thirty-fir&s;t of the third month ere we pa&s;&s;ed the capes of Virginia into the main &s;ea. But after this we made good &s;peed, and the twenty-eighth of the fourth month ca&s;t anchor at King's Road, the harbour for Bri&s;tol. We had in our pa&s;&s;age very high winds and tem|pe&s;tuous weather, which made the &s;ea exceeding rough, the waves ri&s;ing like mountains, &s;o that the ma&s;ters and &s;ailors wondered, and &s;aid, 'They never &s;aw the like before.' But though the wind was &s;trong, it &s;at for the mo&s;t part with us, &s;o that we &s;ailed before it; and the great God who com|mands the winds, who is Lord of heaven; earth, and the &s;eas, and who&s;e wonders are &s;een in the deep, &s;teered our cour&s;e, and pre&s;erved us from many imminent dangers. The &s;ame good hand of Providence that went with us, and carried us &s;afely over, watched over us in our return, and brought us &s;afely back again. Thank&s;givings and prai&s;es be to his holy name for ever! Many &s;weet and precious meetings we had on board the &s;hip during this voyage (commonly two a week) wherein the ble&s;&s;ed pre&s;ence of the

When we came into Bri&s;tol harbour, there lay a man of war, and the pre&s;s-ma&s;ter came on board to impre&s;s our men. We had a meeting at that time in the &s;hip with the &s;eamen, before we went to &s;hore; and the pre&s;s-ma&s;ter &s;at down with us, &s;taid the meeting, and was well &s;atisfied with it.

<P>THIS day we came into Bri&s;tol, near night, from the &s;ea; glory to the Lord God over all for ever, who was our convoy, and &s;teered our cour&s;e! who is the God of the whole earth, of the &s;eas and winds, and made the clouds his chariots, beyond all words, ble&s;&s;ed be his name for ever!

<P>Between this and the fair my wife came out of the north to Bri&s;tol, and her &s;on-in-law Thomas Lower with two of her daughters with her. Her other &s;on-in-law John Rou&s;e, W. Penn and his wife, and Gerrard Roberts came from London, and many friends from &s;everal parts of the nation to the fair, and glorious powerful meetings we had there; for the Lord's in&s;inite power and life was over all. In the fre&s;h openings whereof I was moved to declare of Three
<PB N="171" REF="037441_0687_100D92B268C57830">E&s;tates and Three Teachers, viz. <Q>God was the fir&s;t teach|er of man and woman in paradi&s;e; and as long as they kept to and under his teaching, they kept in the image of God, in his likene&s;s, in righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s, and in dominion over all that God had made; in the ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate, in the paradi&s;e of God. But when they hearkened to the &s;erpent's fal&s;e teaching (who was out of truth) di&s;obey|ed God, and obeyed the &s;erpent, in feeding upon that which God forbad; they lo&s;t the image of God, the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s, came under the power of Satan, and were turned out of paradi&s;e, out of the ble&s;&s;ed into the cur&s;ed &s;tate. Then the promi&s;e of God was, <Q>That the Seed of the woman &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head,</Q> break his power that man and woman were under, and de&s;troy his works. So here were Three States and Three Teachers. God was the Fir&s;t Teacher in paradi&s;e; and whil&s;t man kept under his teaching, he was happy. The &s;erpent was the &s;econd teacher; and when man followed his teaching, he fell into mi&s;ery, into the fall from the image of God, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and holine&s;s, and from the power that he had over all that God had made; and came under the &s;erpent whom he had power over before. Chri&s;t Je&s;us was the Third Teacher; of whom God &s;aith, <Q>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed, hear ye him:</Q> and who him&s;elf &s;aith, "Learn of me." This is the true go&s;pel-teacher, who brui&s;es the head of the &s;er|pent the fal&s;e teacher, and the head of all fal&s;e teachers and fal&s;e religions, fal&s;e ways, fal&s;e wor&s;hips, and fal&s;e churches. Chri&s;t, who &s;aid, who &s;aid, "Learn of me," and of whom the Father &s;aid, "Hear ye him," &s;aid, <Q>I am the way to God, I am the truth, I am the life, and the true light.</Q> So as man and woman come to God, and are renewed up into his image, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and holine&s;s by Chri&s;t, there|by they come into the paradi&s;e of God, the &s;tate which man was in before he &s;ell; and into an higher &s;tate than that, to &s;it down in Chri&s;t who never fell. Therefore the Son of God is to be heard in all things, who is the Saviour and the Redeemer; who hath laid down his life, and bought his &s;heep with his precious blood. We can chal|lenge all the world. Who hath any thing to &s;ay again&s;t our way? our Saviour? our Redeemer? our Prophet, whom God hath rai&s;ed up that we may hear, and whom we mu&s;t hear in all things? Who hath any thing again&s;t our Shepherd, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who leads and &s;eeds us, and
<PB N="172" REF="037441_0688_100D92B46CA24118">we know his heavenly voice? Who hath any thing again&s;t our Bi&s;hop, in who&s;e mouth was never guile found, who doth over&s;ee us in his pa&s;ture of life, that we do not go a&s;tray out of his fold? Who hath any thing again&s;t our Prie&s;t, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, made higher than the heavens, who gives us freely, and commands us to give freely? Who hath any thing to &s;ay again&s;t our Leader and Coun&s;ellor, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who never &s;inned, but is holy, harmle&s;s, and &s;eparate from &s;inners? God hath commanded us to hear him, and he &s;aith, "Learn of me;" and if we &s;hould di&s;obey God's and Chri&s;t's command, we &s;hould be like our father Adam and mother Eve, who di&s;obeyed God's command, and hearkened to the &s;erpent's teaching. Man commands, and would force us to hear the hirelings, who plead for &s;in and the body of death to the grave; which doctrine &s;avours of the devil's teaching, not of Chri&s;t's; but we re&s;olve to hear the Son, as both the Father and he command; and in hearing the Son, we hear the Father al&s;o, as the &s;cripture te&s;tifies. For the author to the He|brews &s;ays, <Q>God, who at &s;undry times and in divers manners &s;pake in time pa&s;t unto the fathers by the pro|phets, hath in the&s;e la&s;t days &s;poken unto us by his Son:</Q> Mark that, God hath &s;poken unto us (his apo&s;tles, di&s;ci|ples, and church) by his Son. And whereas &s;ome have objected, <Q>That although Chri&s;t did &s;peak both to his di&s;ciples and to the Jews in the days of his fle&s;h, yet &s;ince his re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion he doth not &s;peak now;</Q> the an&s;wer is, as God did then &s;peak by his Son in the days of his fle&s;h, &s;o the Son, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, doth now &s;peak by his Spirit. Wherefore John &s;aith in the Revelations, <Q>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit &s;aith to the churches,</Q> Rev. ii. And Chri&s;t is &s;aid to <Q>&s;peak from heaven,</Q> Heb. xii. 25. <Q>See that ye refu&s;e not him that &s;peaketh; for if they e&s;caped not who refu&s;ed him that &s;pake on earth, much more &s;hall not we e&s;cape if we turn away from him that &s;peaketh from heaven.</Q> They that re&s;i&s;ted Mo&s;es's law (who &s;pake on earth) died for it without mercy, which was a natural death; but they that refu&s;e him that &s;peaks from heaven, neglect and &s;light their own &s;alvation, and &s;o die a &s;piritual death, through unbelief and hardne&s;s of heart. Therefore was the exhor|tation given of old, <Q>To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,</Q> &amp;c. Heb. iii. 15. &amp;c. They who neglect or refu&s;e to hear the voice
<PB N="173" REF="037441_0689_100D92B6FA352750">of Chri&s;t now &s;peaking from heaven in this his go&s;pel-day, harden their hearts. Therefore let all mark well the&s;e three &s;tates and teachers: the God of truth was the fir&s;t teacher, while man was in paradi&s;e and in innocence. The &s;erpent was the &s;econd teacher, the fal&s;e teacher, who by his fal&s;e teaching came to be the god of the world which lies in wickedne&s;s. Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head, is the third teacher, who &s;aith, "Learn of me;" of whom God &s;aith, <Q>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed, hear ye him;</Q> and of whom the te&s;ti|mony of the &s;aints of old was, <Q>That God hath in the&s;e la&s;t days &s;poken unto us by his Son.</Q> Thus they, that come to be renewed up again into the divine heavenly image in which man was at fir&s;t made, will know the &s;ame God, that was the fir&s;t teacher of Adam and Eve in para|di&s;e, to &s;peak to them now by his Son, who changes not; glory be to his name for ever!</Q></P>
<P>Many deep and precious things were opened in tho&s;e meetings by the eternal Spirit which &s;earcheth and reveal|eth the deep things of God. After I had fini&s;hed my &s;er|vice for the Lord in that city, I departed into Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire, where we had many large and precious meetings; and the Lord's everla&s;ting power flowed over all. From Glou|ce&s;ter&s;hire I pa&s;&s;ed into Wilt&s;hire, where al&s;o we had many ble&s;&s;ed meetings. At Slattenford in Wilt&s;hire we had a very good meeting, though we met with much oppo&s;ition from &s;ome, who had &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t women's meetings; which I was moved of the Lord to recommend to friends, for the benefit of the church of Chri&s;t. <Q>That faithful wo|men, called to the belief of the truth, made partakers of the &s;ame precious faith, and heirs of the &s;ame everla&s;ting go&s;pel of life and &s;alvation as the men are, might in like manner come into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and practice of the go&s;pel|order, and therein be meet helps unto the men in the re|&s;toration, in the &s;ervice of truth, in the affairs of the church, as they are outwardly in civil or temporal things. That &s;o all the family of God, women as well as men, might know, po&s;&s;e&s;s, perform, and di&s;charge their offices and &s;ervices in the hou&s;e of God, whereby the poor might be the better taken care of; the younger &s;ort in&s;tructed, informed, and taught in the way of God; the loo&s;e and di&s;orderly reproved and admoni&s;hed in the fear of the Lord; the clearne&s;s of per&s;ons propo&s;ing marriage, more clo&s;ely and &s;trictly inquired into in the wi&s;dom of God;
<PB N="174" REF="037441_0690_100D92B88FFB7DE0">and all the members of the &s;piritual body the church might watch over and be helpful to each other in love.</Q> After the&s;e oppo&s;ers had run into much contention and wrangling, the power of the Lord &s;truck down one of the chief of them, &s;o that his &s;pirit &s;unk, and he came to be &s;en&s;ible of the evil he had done, in oppo&s;ing God's heavenly power, con|fe&s;&s;ed his error before friends, and afterwards gave forth a paper of condemnation, wherein he declared, <Q>That he did wilfully oppo&s;e (although I often warned him to take heed) until the fire of the Lord did burn within him, and he &s;aw the angel of the Lord with his &s;word drawn in his hand, ready to cut him off,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition was made at the meeting, yet a very good and &s;erviceable meeting it was; for occa|&s;ion was thereby admini&s;tered to an&s;wer their objections and cavils, and to open the &s;ervices of women in and for the church. At this meeting the women's meetings for that county were e&s;tabli&s;hed in the ble&s;&s;ed power of God.</P>
<P>After this I went to Marlborough, and had a meeting there, to which &s;ome of the magi&s;trates came, and were civil and moderate. Then pa&s;&s;ing to Bartholomew Maylin's, I had a very precious meeting there. From thence went a lit|tle beyond Ore, where we had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting, and very large, as we had al&s;o &s;oon after upon the border of Hamp|&s;hire. Then turning into Oxford&s;hire, we vi&s;ited friends there; then went to Reading where we had a large meeting. From thence pa&s;&s;ing into Buckingham&s;hire, we had many precious meetings in that county. After which we vi&s;ited friends till we came to King&s;ton upon Thames, where my wife and her daughter Rachel met me.</P>
<P>I made no long &s;tay at King&s;ton, but went to London, where I found the Bapti&s;ts and Socinians, with &s;ome old apo&s;tates grown very rude, having printed many books again&s;t us: &s;o I had a great travail in the Lord's power, before I could get clear of that city. But ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, his power came over them, and all their lying, wic|ked, &s;candalous books were an&s;wered. I made a &s;hort journey into &s;ome parts of E&s;&s;ex and Middle&s;ex, vi&s;iting friends at their meetings, and their children at the &s;chools, and returned &s;oon to London. After &s;ome &s;ervice there among friends. I went to King&s;ton, and from thence to Stephen Smith's, in Surrey, where was a very large meet|ing, many hundreds of people attending it. I &s;taid in the&s;e parts till I had cleared my&s;elf of the &s;ervice the Lord
<PB N="175" REF="037441_0691_100D92BA2ACA0678">had given me to do there, and then returned by King&s;ton to London, whither I felt my &s;pirit drawn; having heard that many friends were taken before the magi&s;trates, and di|vers impri&s;oned, both in London and in other parts of the nation, for opening their &s;hop-windows upon holy-days and fa&s;t-days (as they were called) and for bearing te&s;timony again&s;t all &s;uch ob&s;ervation of days. Which friends could not but do, knowing that the true Chri&s;tians did not ob&s;erve the Jews holy-days in the apo&s;tles times, neither could we ob&s;erve the Heathens and Papi&s;ts holy days (&s;o called) which have been &s;et up among&s;t tho&s;e called Chri&s;tians &s;ince the apo&s;tles days. For we were redeemed out of days by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and brought into the day which hath &s;prung from on high, and are come into him, who is Lord of the Jewi&s;h &s;abbath, and the &s;ub&s;tance of the Jews &s;igns.</P>
<P>After I had &s;taid &s;ome time in London, labouring for &s;ome relief and ea&s;e to friends in this ca&s;e, I went with my wife, and her daughter Rachel, to Hendon, in Middle&s;ex, and from thence to William Penn's at Rickman&s;worth, in Hertford&s;hire, whither Thomas Lower, who married an|other of my wife's daughters, came the next day to accom|pany us in our journey northward. After we had vi&s;ited friends thereabouts, we pa&s;&s;ed to a friend's hou&s;e near Ayle&s;|bury; and from thence to Bray Doily's at Adderbury, in Oxford&s;hire, where, on fir&s;t-day, we had a large and pre|cious meeting. Truth being well &s;pread, and friends in tho&s;e parts much increa&s;ed in number, two or three new meetings were then &s;et up thereabouts.</P>
<P>At night, as I was &s;itting at &s;upper, I felt I was taken; yet I &s;aid nothing to any body of it then. But getting out next morning, we travelled into Worce&s;ter&s;hire, and went to john Halford's at Arm&s;cot, in Tredington pari&s;h; where we had a very large and precious meeting in his b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rn, the Lord's powerful pre&s;ence being eminently with and among&s;t us. After the meeting, friends being mo&s;t of them gone, as I was &s;itting in the parlour, di&s;cour&s;ing with &s;ome friends, Henry Parker, a ju&s;tice, came to the hou&s;e, and with him Rowland Hains, a prie&s;t of Hunniton, in Warwick&s;hire. This ju&s;tice came to know of the meeting by means of a woman-friend, who, being nur&s;e to a child of his, a&s;ked leave of her mi&s;tre&s;s to go to the meeting to &s;ee me; and &s;he &s;peaking of it to her hu&s;band, he and the prie&s;t plotted together to break up the meeting, and apprehend me. But by means of their &s;itting long at dinner, it being the day on

But though there was no meeting when they came, yet I being in the hou&s;e, who was the per&s;on they aimed at, Henry Parker took me, and Thomas Lower for company with me, and though he had nothing to lay to our charge, &s;ent us both to Worce&s;ter gaol, by a &s;trange &s;ort of mittimus; a copy of which here followeth:</P>

<P>When we had been &s;ome time in the gaol, we thought fit to lay our ca&s;e before the lord Wind&s;or, lord-lieutenant of Worce&s;ter&s;hire, and before the deputy-lieutenants, and other magi&s;trates; which we did by the following letter:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THESE are to inform you, the lord-lieutenant (&s;o cal|led) the deputy-lieutenants, and the ju&s;tices of the county of Worce&s;ter&s;hire, how unchri&s;tianly and inhumanly we have been dealt withal by Henry Parker, a ju&s;tice (&s;o cal|led) in our journey towards the north. We coming to our friend John Hal&s;ord's, the 17th of the 10th month, 1673, &s;ome friends bringing us on the way, and others coming to vi&s;it us there; towards night came the afore&s;aid ju&s;tice, and a prie&s;t called Rowland Hains, of Hunniton, in Warwick&s;hire, and demanded our names and places of abode. And though we were not in any meeting, but were di&s;cour&s;ing together when they came in, he made a mittimus to &s;end us to Worce&s;ter gaol. Now whereas he &s;ays in his mittimus, <Q>That complaint had been made to him of &s;everal by-pa&s;t meetings of many hundreds at a
<PB N="178" REF="037441_0694_100D92C17A5F3108">time;</Q> we know nothing of that, nor do we think that concerns us. And whereas he &s;ays further, <Q>That no &s;atisfactory account of our &s;ettlement or place of habita|tion appeared unto him;</Q> this he contradicts in his own mittimus, mentioning therein the places of our abode and habitation; the account of which we &s;atisfactorily and ful|ly gave him. And one of us (Thomas Lower) told him, that he was going down with his mother-in-law (who is George Fox's wife) and with his &s;i&s;ter, to fetch up his own wife and child out of the north into his own country. And the other of us (George Fox) told him, that he was bringing forward his wife on her journey towards the north who had been at London to vi&s;it one of her daughters, who had lately lain in. And having received a me&s;&s;age from his mother, an ancient woman in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, that &s;he earne&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;ee him before &s;he died, he intend|ed, as &s;oon as he had brought his wife on her journey as far as Cau&s;al, in Warwick&s;hire, to turn into Leice&s;ter&s;hire, to vi&s;it his mother and relations there, and then to have returned to London. But by his interrupting us in our journey, taking the hu&s;band from his wife, the &s;on from his mother and &s;i&s;ter, and &s;topping him from vi&s;iting his wife and child &s;o remote, we were forced to get &s;trangers, or whom we could, to help them on their journey, to our great damage and their hindrance. We a&s;ked the prie&s;t, <Q>whether this was his go&s;pel, and their way of entertaining &s;trangers?</Q> And we de&s;ired the ju&s;tice to con&s;ider, whe|ther this was doing "as he would be done by?" But he &s;aid, "He had &s;aid it, and he would do it". And where|as he &s;ays, "We refu&s;ed to give &s;ureties." He a&s;ked only George Fox for &s;ureties; who replied, <Q>He was an in|nocent man, and knew no law he had broken;</Q> but he did not a&s;k Thomas Lower for any, as if it had been crime and cau&s;e enough for his commitment that he came out of Cornwall. If we were at a meeting, as he &s;ays in his mit|timus, he might have proceeded otherwi&s;e, than by &s;end|ing us to gaol, to an&s;wer the breach of the common laws; though he &s;hewed us no breach of any, as may be &s;een in the mittimus. We thought fit to lay before you the &s;ub|&s;tance of his proceedings again&s;t us, hoping there will more moderation and ju&s;tice appear in you towards us, that we may pro&s;ecute our intended journey.</P>

But no enlargement did we receive by our application to the lord Wind&s;or (&s;o called.) And although Thomas Lower received &s;everal letters from his brother Dr. Lower, who was one of the king's phy&s;icians, concerning his liber|ty, and one, by his procurement, from Henry Savil, who was of the king's bed-chamber; to his brother called the lord Wind&s;or to the &s;ame effect; yet &s;eeing it related only to his enlargement, not mine, &s;o great was his love and re|gard to me, that he would not &s;eek his own liberty &s;ingly, but kept the letter by him un&s;ent; &s;o we were continued pri&s;oners till the next general quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions of the peace. At which time divers friends from &s;everal places being in town, did &s;peak to the ju&s;tices concerning us; who &s;poke fair, and &s;aid we &s;hould be di&s;charged. For many of the ju&s;|tices &s;eemed to di&s;like the &s;everity of Parker's proceedings again&s;t us, and declared an aver&s;ene&s;s to en&s;nare us by the tender of the oaths. Some friends al&s;o had &s;poken with lord Wind&s;or, who likewi&s;e &s;poke them fair; &s;o that it was the general di&s;cour&s;e we &s;hould be di&s;charged. We heard al&s;o, that Dr. Lower had procured a letter from colonel Sands at London, to &s;ome of the ju&s;tices in our favour. Some of the ju&s;tices al&s;o &s;poke to &s;ome friends, to acquaint us, that they would have us &s;peak but little in the court, le&s;t we &s;hould provoke any of the bench, and they would warrant we &s;hould be di&s;charged.</P>
<P>We were not called till the la&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ions, which was the twenty-fir&s;t of the eleventh month, 1673. When we came in, they were &s;truck with palene&s;s in their faces, and it was &s;ome time before any thing was &s;poken; in&s;omuch that a butcher in the hall &s;aid, <Q>What! are they afraid? Dare not the ju&s;tices &s;peak to them?</Q> At length, before they &s;poke to us, ju&s;tice Parker made a long &s;peech on the bench, much to the &s;ame effect as was contained in the mittimus, often mentioning the common laws, but not in&s;tancing any we had broken. Adding, <Q>That he thought it a milder cour&s;e to &s;end us two to gaol, than to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t his neighbours to the lo&s;s of two hundred pounds, which they mu&s;t have &s;uffered if he had put the law in execution again&s;t conventicles.</Q> But in this he was either very ig|norant, or very deceitful; for there being no meeting when he came, nor any to inform, he had no evidence to convict us, or his neighbours by.</P>
<P>When Parker had ended his &s;peech, the ju&s;tices began with Thomas Lower, whom they examined of the cau&s;e of
<PB N="180" REF="037441_0696_100D92C5B68F7BC8">his coming into that country; of which he gave them a full and plain account. Sometimes I put in a word while they were examining him, and then they told me, <Q>They were upon his examination, when it came to my turn, I &s;hould have free liberty to &s;peak, for they would not hinder me; but I &s;hould have full time, and they would not en&s;nare us.</Q> When they had done with him, they a&s;ked me an account of my travel, which I gave them, as is mentioned before, but more largely. And whereas ju&s;tice Parker, to aggravate the ca&s;e, had made a great noi&s;e of <Q>there being &s;ome from London, &s;ome from the north, &s;ome from Corn|wall, and &s;ome from Bri&s;tol, at the hou&s;e when I was taken.</Q> I told him, <Q>This was in a manner all but one family. For there was none from London, but my&s;elf; none from the north, but my wife and her daughter; none from Cornwall, but my &s;on-in-law Thomas Lower; nor any from Bri&s;tol, but one friend, a merchant there, who me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> us, as it were, providentially, to a&s;&s;i&s;t my wife and her daughter in their journey homewards, when by our impri&s;onment they were deprived of our company and help.</Q> When I had &s;poken, the chairman, who&s;e name was Simp&s;on, an old Pre&s;byterian, &s;aid, <Q>Your relation or account is very innocent.</Q> Then he Parker whi&s;pered awhile together, and after that the chairman &s;tood up, and &s;aid: <Q>You, Mr Fox, are a famous man, and all this may be true which you have &s;aid; but that we may be the bet|ter &s;atisfied, will you take the oaths of allegiance and &s;u|premacy?</Q> I told them, 'They had &s;aid, <Q>They would not en&s;nare us;</Q> but this was a plain &s;nare: for they 'knew we could not take any oath.; However, they can&s;|ed the oath to be read; and when they had done, I told them, <Q>I never took an oath in my life, but I had always been true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the government: that I was ca&s;t into pri&s;on at Derby, and kept a pri&s;oner &s;ix months there, becau&s;e I would not take up arms again&s;t king Charles at Wor|ce&s;ter-fight; and for going to mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings, was carried up out of Leice&s;ter&s;hire, and brought before Oliver Cromwel, as a plotter to bring in king Charles. And ye know,' &s;aid I, in your own con&s;ciences, that we, the people called Qua|kers, cannot take an oath, nor &s;wear in any ca&s;e, becau&s;e Chri&s;t hath forbidden it. But as to the matter or &s;ub|&s;tance contained in the oaths, this I can and do &s;ay, that I do own and acknowledge the king of England to be lawful heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the realm of England, and do abhor
<PB N="181" REF="037441_0697_100D92C8389EDB98">all plots and plotters, and contrivances again&s;t him; and I have nothing in my heart, but love and good-will to him and all men, and de&s;ire his and their pro&s;perity; the Lord knows it, before whom I &s;tand an innocent man. And as to the oath of &s;upremacy, I deny the pope, his power, and his religion, and abhor it with my heart.</Q> While I was &s;peaking, they cried, 'Give him the book.' I &s;aid, <Q>The book &s;aith, "Swear not at all." Then they cried, Take him away, gaoler;</Q> and I &s;till &s;peaking on, they were urgent upon the gaoler, crying, <Q>Take him away, we &s;hall have a meeting here. Why do you not take him away? That fellow (meaning the gaoler) loves to hear him preach.</Q> Then the gaoler drew me away; and as I was turning from them, I &s;tretched out my arm, and &s;aid, <Q>The Lord forgive you, who ca&s;t me into pri&s;on for obey|ing the doctrine of Chri&s;t.</Q> Thus they apparently broke their promi&s;e in the face of the country; for they promi&s;ed I &s;hould have free liberty to &s;peak, but now they would not give it me; and they promi&s;ed they would not en&s;nare us, yet now they tendered me the oaths on purpo&s;e to en|&s;nare me.</P>
<P>After I was had away, Thomas Lower was &s;tayed behind in the court; and they told him, 'He was at liberty.' Then he would have rea&s;oned with them, a&s;king them, <Q>Why I might not be &s;et at liberty as well as he, &s;eeing we were both taken together, and our ca&s;e was alike?</Q> But they told him, 'They would not hear him;' &s;aying, <Q>You may be gone about your bu&s;ine&s;s, for we have nothing more to &s;ay to you, &s;eeing you are di&s;charged.</Q> This was all he could get from them. Wherefore, after the court was ri&s;en, he went to &s;peak with them at their chamber, de&s;iring to know, <Q>What cau&s;e they had to detain his father, &s;eeing they had di&s;charged him?</Q> and wi&s;hing them to con&s;ider, whether this was not partiality, and would be a blemi&s;h to them. Whereupon Simp&s;on threatened him, &s;aying, <Q>If you be not content we will tender you the oaths al&s;o, and &s;end you to your father.</Q> To which he replied, <Q>They might do that, if they thought fit; but whether they &s;ent him or no, he intended to go and wait upon his father in pri&s;on; for that was now his bu&s;ine&s;s in that country.</Q> Then &s;aid ju&s;tice Parker to him, <Q>Do you think, Mr. Lower, that I had not cau&s;e to &s;end your father and you to pri&s;on, when you had &s;uch a great meeting that the par&s;on of the pari&s;h complained to me, that he hath lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of his
<PB N="182" REF="037441_0698_100D92C9CCF686F8">pari&s;hioners; &s;o that when he comes among&s;t them he has &s;carce any auditors left?</Q> 'I have heard,' replied Thomas Lower, <Q>that the prie&s;t of that pari&s;h comes &s;o &s;eldom to vi&s;it his flock (but once, it may be, or twice in a year, to gather up his tithes) that it was but charity in my father to vi&s;it &s;uch a forlorn and for&s;aken flock; therefore thou had&s;t no cau&s;e to &s;end my father to pri&s;on for vi&s;iting them, or for teaching, in&s;tructing, and directing them to Chri&s;t, their true teacher, who had &s;o little comfort or benefit from their pretended pa&s;tor, who comes among&s;t them only to &s;eck for his "gain from his quarter."</Q> Upon this the ju&s;tices fell a laughing; for it &s;eems Dr. Crowder, the prie&s;t they &s;poke of, was then &s;itting among them, though Thomas Lower did not know him; and he had the wit to hold his tongue, and not undertake to vindicate him&s;elf in a matter &s;o noto|riou&s;ly known to be true. But when Thomas Lower was come from them, the ju&s;tices did &s;o play upon Dr. Crow|der, that he was pitifully a&s;hamed, and &s;o nettled with it, that he threatened to &s;ue Thomas Lower in the bi&s;hop's court, upon an action of defamation. Which when Tho|mas Lower heard of, he &s;ent him word, he would an&s;wer his &s;uit, let him begin it when he would; and would bring his whole pari&s;h in evidence again&s;t him. This cooled the doctor. Yet &s;ome time after he came to the pri&s;on, pre|tending he had a mind to di&s;pute with me, and to talk with Thomas Lower about that bu&s;ine&s;s; and he brought ano|ther with him, he him&s;elf being then a prebendary at Wor|ce&s;ter.</P>
<P>When he came in, he a&s;ked me, <Q>What I was in pri&s;on for?</Q> 'Do&s;t not thou know that?' &s;aid I. <Q>Wa&s;t not thou upon the bench, when ju&s;tice Simp&s;on and Parker tendered the oath to me? And had&s;t not thou an hand in it?</Q> Then he &s;aid, <Q>It is lawful to &s;wear; and Chri&s;t did not forbid &s;wearing before a magi&s;trate; but &s;wearing by the &s;un and the like.</Q> I bid him prove that by the &s;criptures, but he could not. Then he brought that &s;aying of Paul's. 'All things are lawful unto me,' 1 Cor. vi. 12. 'And if,' &s;aid he, <Q>all things were lawful unto him, then &s;wearing was lawful unto him.</Q> 'By this argument,' &s;aid I, <Q>thou may&s;t al&s;o affirm, that drunkenne&s;s, adultery, and all manner of &s;in and wickedne&s;s is lawful al&s;o, as well as &s;wearing.</Q> 'Why,' &s;aid Dr. Crowder, <Q>do you hold that adultery is unlawful?</Q> 'Yes,' &s;aid I, 'that I do.' <Q>Why then,</Q> &s;aid he, 'this contradicts the &s;aying of St. Paul.'
<PB N="183" REF="037441_0699_100D92CC15EC6D40">Thereupon I called to the pri&s;oners and the gaoler, to hear what doctrine Dr. Crowder had laid down for orthodox, viz. <Q>that drunkenne&s;s, &s;wearing, adultery, and &s;uch like things were lawful.</Q> Then he &s;aid, <Q>He would give it under his hand;</Q> and took a pen, but wrote another thing than what he had &s;poken. Then turning to Thomas Lower, he a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether he would an&s;wer what he had there writ|ten?</Q> Who undertook it. Whereupon, when he had threatened Thomas Lower to &s;ue him in the bi&s;hop's court for &s;peaking &s;o abu&s;ively (as he called it) of him before the ju&s;tices, and Thomas had bid him begin when he plea&s;ed, for he would an&s;wer him, and bring his pari&s;hioners in evi|dence again&s;t him, he went away in a great fret, grumbling to him&s;elf as he went. A few days after Thomas Lower &s;ent him an an&s;wer to the paper he had wrote and left with him; which an&s;wer a friend of Worce&s;ter carried to him, and he read it, and &s;aid, 'He would reply to it;' but he never did, though he often &s;ent him word he would do it.</P>
<P>Soon after the &s;e&s;&s;ions, the term coming on, an Habeas Corpus was &s;ent to Worce&s;ter for the &s;heriff to bring me up to the king's-bench-bar. Whereupon the under-&s;heriff, having made Thomas Lower his deputy to convey me to London, we &s;et out the twenty-ninth of the eleventh month, 1673, and came to London the &s;econd of the twelfth month; the ways being very deep, and the waters out. Next day, notice being given that I was brought up, the &s;heriff was or|dered to bring me into court. I went accordingly, and did appear in court before judge Wild; and both he and the lawyers were pretty fair, &s;o that I had time to &s;peak, to clear my innocency, and &s;hew my wrong impri&s;onment. After the return of the writ was entered, I was ordered to be brought into court again next day; the order of court be|ing as followeth:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Accordingly I went in the morning, and walked in the hall till the &s;heriff came to me (for he tru&s;ted me to go whi|ther I would) and it being early, we went into the court of King's Bench, and &s;at among the lawyers almo&s;t an hour, till the judges came in, when the &s;heriff took off my hat; and after awhile I was called. The Lord's pre&s;ence was with me, and his power I felt was over all. I &s;tood and heard the king's attorney, who&s;e name was Jones, who in deed &s;poke notably on my behalf, as did al&s;o another coun|&s;ellor after him; and the judges, who were three, were all very moderate, not ca&s;ting any reflecting words at me. I &s;tood &s;till in the power and Spirit of the Lord, &s;eeing how the Lord was at work, and the earth was helping the wo|man. But when they had done, I applied my&s;elf to the chief ju&s;tice, de&s;iring, 'That I might &s;peak;' and he &s;aid, I might. <Q>Then I related the cau&s;e of our journey, the manner of our being taken and committed, and the time of our impri&s;onment until the &s;e&s;&s;ions; with a brief ac|count of our trial at the &s;e&s;&s;ions, and what I had offered to the ju&s;tices then, as a declaration that I could make or &s;ign, in&s;tead of the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy.</Q> When I had done, the chief ju&s;tice &s;aid, <Q>I was to be turn|ed over to the King's-bench, and the &s;heriff of Worce&s;ter to be di&s;charged of me.</Q> He &s;aid al&s;o, <Q>That they would con&s;ider further of it; and if they found any error in the record, or in the ju&s;tices proceedings, I &s;hould be &s;et at liberty.</Q> So a tip&s;taff was called to take me into cu&s;tody, and he delivered me to the keeper of the King's-bench, who let me go to a friend's hou&s;e, where I lodged and appointed to meet me at Edward Man's in Bi&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet the next day. But after this, ju&s;tice Parker, or &s;ome other of my ad|ver&s;aries, moved the court, that I might be &s;ent back to Worce&s;ter. Whereupon another day was appointed for another hearing, and they had four coun&s;el that pleaded again&s;t me. George Stroude, a coun&s;ellor, pleaded for me, and was pleading before I was brought into the court; but they bore him down, and prevailed with the judges to give judgment. <Q>That I &s;hould be &s;ent down to Worce&s;ter &s;e&s;|&s;ions.</Q> Only they told me I might put in bail to appear
<PB N="185" REF="037441_0701_100D92D087B1F880">at the &s;e&s;&s;ions, and to be of good behaviour in the mean time. I told them, <Q>I never was of ill behaviour in my life; and that they, the four judges, might as well put the oath to me there, as &s;end me to Worce&s;ter to be en&s;nared by the ju&s;tices, in their putting the oath to me, and then premuniring me, who never took oath in my life. I told them, if I broke my Yea or Nay, I was content to &s;uffer the &s;ame penalty which they &s;hould that break their oaths.</Q> This alteration of the judges minds in my ca&s;e proceeded, as was thought, from &s;ome fal&s;e informations that my adver&s;ary ju&s;tice Parker had given again&s;t me: for between the times of my former appearance and this, he had &s;pread abroad a very fal&s;e and malicious &s;tory, viz. <Q>That there were many &s;ub&s;tantial men with me out of &s;everal parts of the nation when he took me, and that we had a de&s;ign or plot in hand; and that Thomas Lower &s;taid with me in pri&s;on long after he was &s;et at liberty, to carry on our de&s;ign.</Q> This was &s;poken in the parliament|hou&s;e; in&s;omuch that if I had not been brought up to London when I was, I had been &s;topped at Worce&s;ter, and Thomas had been re-committed with me. But although the&s;e lies were eafily di&s;proved and laid open to Parker's &s;hame, yet would not the judges alter their la&s;t &s;entence, but remanded me to Worce&s;ter gaol; only this favour was granted, that I might go down my own way, and at my own lei&s;ure; provided I would be without fail there by the a&s;&s;ize, which was to begin the &s;econd of the &s;econd month following.</P>
<P>I &s;taid in and about London till towards the latter end of the fir&s;t month 1674, and then went down lei&s;urely (for I was not able to abide ha&s;ty and hard travelling) and came into Worce&s;ter the la&s;t of the fir&s;t month 1674, being the day before the judges came to town. The &s;econd day of the &s;econd month I was brought from the gaol to an inn near the hall that I might be in readine&s;s if I &s;hould be called. But not being called that day, the gaoler came at night, and told me, 'I might go home,' meaning to the gaol. Gerrard Roberts of London being with me, he and I walked down together to the gaol without any keeper. Next day being brought up again, they &s;et a little boy about eleven years old to be my keeper. I came to under|&s;tand ju&s;tice Parker and the clerk of the peace had given order that I &s;hould not be put into the calendar, that I might not be brought before the judge; wherefore I got
<PB N="186" REF="037441_0702_100D92D217C63A38">the judge's &s;on to move in court, <Q>That I might be called:</Q> whereupon I was called and brought to the bar before judge Turner, my old adver&s;ary, who had ten|dered me the oaths, and premunired me once before at Lanca&s;ter. After &s;ilence made, he a&s;ked me, <Q>What I did de&s;ire?</Q> I an&s;wered, 'My liberty according to ju&s;tice.' He &s;aid, 'I lay upon the oath;' and a&s;ked, <Q>If I would take it?</Q> <Q>I de&s;ired he would hear the manner of my being taken and committed;</Q> and being &s;ilent, I gave him an account thereof at large, as is before &s;et down, letting him al&s;o know, <Q>That &s;ince my impri&s;onment I had under|&s;tood my mother, who was an ancient, tender woman, and had de&s;ired to &s;ee me before &s;he died, hearing that I was &s;topped and impri&s;oned in my journey, &s;o that I was not likely to come to &s;ee her, it &s;truck her &s;o, that &s;he died &s;oon after, which was a very hard thing to me.</Q> When I had done &s;peaking, he again a&s;ked me, 'To take the oaths.' I told him, <Q>I could not take any oath, for con&s;cience-&s;ake; and I did believe he and they all knew in their con&s;ciences 'that it was for con&s;cience-&s;ake I could not &s;wear at all. I declared among&s;t them what I could &s;ay and what I could &s;ign, in owning of the king's right to the government, and in denying the pope and his pretended power, and all plot|ters, plots, and con&s;piracies again&s;t the government.</Q> Some thought the judge had a mind to &s;et me at liberty, for he &s;aw they had nothing ju&s;tly again&s;t me; but Parker, who com|mitted me, endeavoured to incen&s;e him, telling him, <Q>That I was a ringleader; that many of the nation followed me, and he knew not what it might come to;</Q> with many more envi|ous words, which &s;ome took notice of; who al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the judge gave him never a word in an&s;wer. However, the judge, willing to ea&s;e him&s;elf, referred me and my ca&s;e to the &s;e&s;&s;ions again, bidding the ju&s;tices make an end of it there, and not trouble the a&s;&s;izes any more with me. So I was continued pri&s;oner, chiefly (as it &s;eemed) through the means of ju&s;tice Parker, who in this ca&s;e was as fal&s;e as en|vious; for he had promi&s;ed Richard Cannon of London, who had acquaintance with him, <Q>That he would endea|vour to have me &s;et at liberty;</Q> yet he was the wor&s;t ene|my I had in court, as &s;ome of the court ob&s;erved and re|ported. Other ju&s;tices were very loving, and promi&s;ed. <Q>That I &s;hould have the liberty of the town, and to lodge at a friend's hou&s;e till the &s;e&s;&s;ions;</Q> which accordingly I had, and the people were very civil and re&s;pectful to me.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="037441_0703_100D92D4847E0640">
Between this time and the &s;e&s;&s;ions I had &s;ome &s;ervice for the Lord with &s;everal that came to vi&s;it me. At one time came three nonconformi&s;t prie&s;ts and two lawyers to di&s;cour&s;e with me; and one of the prie&s;ts undertook to prove, 'That the &s;criptures are the only rule of life.' Af|ter I had defeated his proof, I had a fit opportunity to open to them, <Q>The right and proper u&s;e, &s;ervice, and ex|cellency of the &s;criptures; and al&s;o to &s;hew, that the Spirit of God which was given to every one to profit withal, the grace of God which bringeth &s;alvation, and which hath appeared to all men, and teacheth them that obey it to deny ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;ober|ly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world; that this, I &s;ay, is the mo&s;t fit, proper, and univer&s;al rule which God hath given to all mankind to rule, direct, govern, and order their lives by.</Q></P>
<P>Another time came a common-prayer prie&s;t, and &s;ome people with him. He a&s;ked me, <Q>If I was grown up to perfection?</Q> I told him, <Q>What I was, I was by the grace of God.</Q> He replied, 'It was a mode&s;t and civil an&s;wer.' Then he urged the words of John, <Q>If we &s;ay that we have no &s;in, we deceive our&s;elves, and the truth is not in us.</Q> He a&s;ked, 'What did I &s;ay to that?' <Q>I &s;aid with the &s;ame apo&s;tle, <Q>If we &s;ay that we have not &s;inned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us;</Q> who came to de&s;troy &s;in, and to take away &s;in. So there is a time for people to &s;ee that they have &s;inned, and there is a time for them to &s;ee that they have &s;in; and there is a time for them to confe&s;s their &s;in, and to for&s;ake it, and to know the blood of Chri&s;t to clean&s;e from all &s;in.</Q> Then the prie&s;t was a&s;ked, <Q>Whether Adam was not perfect before he &s;ell? and whether all God's works were not perfect?</Q> The prie&s;t &s;aid, <Q>There might be a perfection as Adam had, and a falling from it.</Q> But I told him, <Q>There is a perfection in Chri&s;t above Adam, and beyond falling; and that it was the work of the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to pre&s;ent every man perfect in Chri&s;t; for the perfecting of whom they had their gifts from Chri&s;t; therefore they that denied per|fection, denied the work of the mini&s;try, and the gifts which Chri&s;t gave for the perfecting of the &s;aints.</Q> The prie&s;t &s;aid. 'We mu&s;t always be &s;triving.' I an&s;wered, <Q>It was a &s;ad and comfortle&s;s &s;ort of &s;triving, to &s;trive with a belief that we &s;hould never overcome.</Q> I told him al&s;o, that 'Paul, who cried out of the body of death, did al&s;o
<PB N="188" REF="037441_0704_100D92D79AB91850">
<Q>thank God, who gave him the victory through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> So there was a time of crying out for want 'of victory, and a time of prai&s;ing God for the victory. 'And Paul &s;aid, <Q>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q> The prie&s;t &s;aid, <Q>Job was not per|fect.</Q> I told him, <Q>God &s;aid Job was a perfect man, and that he did &s;hun evil; and the devil was forced to confe&s;s, that "God had &s;et an hedge about him;" which was not an outward hedge, but the invi&s;ible, heavenly power.</Q> The prie&s;t &s;aid, 'Job &s;aid, <Q>He chargeth his angels with folly, and the heavens are not clean in his &s;ight.</Q> I told him, <Q>That was his mi&s;take, it was not Job &s;aid &s;o, but Eliphaz, who contended again&s;t Job.</Q> 'Well, but,' &s;aid the prie&s;t, 'what &s;ay you to that &s;cripture, <Q>The ju&s;te&s;t man that is &s;inneth &s;even times a day?</Q> 'Why truly,' &s;aid I, 'I &s;ay there is no &s;uch &s;cripture;' and with that the prie&s;t's mouth was &s;topped. Many other &s;ervices I had with &s;everal &s;orts of people between the a&s;&s;izes and the &s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The next quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions began the twenty-ninth of the &s;econd month, and I was called before the ju&s;tices. The chairman's name was&mdash;Street, he was a judge in the Wel&s;h circuit, and he mi&s;repre&s;ented me and my ca&s;e to the country, telling them <Q>That we had a meeting at Treding|ton from all parts of the nation, to the terrifying of the king's &s;ubjects, for which we had been committed to pri|&s;on: that for the trial of my fidelity the oaths were put to me; and, having had time to con&s;ider of it, he a&s;ked me if I would now take the oaths?</Q> <Q>I de&s;ired liberty to &s;peak for my&s;elf; and, having obtained that, began fir&s;t to clear my&s;elf from tho&s;e fal&s;ehoods he had charged on me and friends; declaring, that we had not any &s;uch meeting from all parts of the nation, as he had repre&s;ented it; but that (except the friend from who&s;e hou&s;e we came, and who came with us to guide us thither, and one friend of Bri&s;|tol, who came accidentally, or rather providentially, to a&s;&s;i&s;t my wife homewards, after we were taken) they that were with me were in a &s;en&s;e part of my own family, be|ing my wife, her daughter, and her &s;on-in-law. And we did not meet in any way or manner that would occa&s;ion terror to any of the king's &s;ubjects; for we met peaceably and quietly, without arms; and I did not believe there could be any one produced that could truly &s;ay he was terrified with our meeting. Be&s;ides, I told them we were
<PB N="189" REF="037441_0705_100D92D9AC230AB0">but in our journey, the occa&s;ion whereof I now related as before. As to the oaths, I &s;hewed why I could not take them (&s;eeing Chri&s;t hath forbidden all &s;wearing) and what I could &s;ay or &s;ign in lieu of them, as I had done before. Yet they cau&s;ed the oaths to be read to me, and after|wards read an indictment, which they had drawn up in readine&s;s, having a jury ready al&s;o.</Q> When the indict|ment was read, the judge a&s;ked me, 'If I was guilty?' I &s;aid, <Q>Nay; for it was a great bundle of lies; which I &s;hewed and proved to the judge in &s;everal particulars, which I in&s;tanced; a&s;king him, if he did not know in his con&s;cience they were lies?</Q> He &s;aid, 'It was their form.' I &s;aid, 'It was not a true form.' He a&s;ked me again, 'Whether I was guilty?' I told him, <Q>Nay, I was not guilty of the matter, nor of the form; for I was again&s;t the 'pope and popery, and did acknowledge and &s;hould &s;et my hand to that.</Q> Then the judge told the jury what they &s;hould &s;ay and do, and what they &s;hould write on the back|&s;ide of the indictment; and as he &s;aid, they did. But be|fore the jury gave in their verdict, I told them, <Q>It was for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and in obedience to his and his apo&s;tle's command, that I could not &s;wear; therefore,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>take heed what ye do, for before his judgment-&s;eat ye &s;hall all be brought.</Q> The judge &s;aid, 'This is canting.' I &s;aid, <Q>If to confe&s;s Chri&s;t our Lord and Saviour, and to obey his command, be called canting by a judge of a court, it is to little purpo&s;e for me to &s;ay more among you; yet ye &s;hall &s;ee that I am a chri&s;tian, and &s;hall &s;hew forth chri&s;tianity, and my innocency &s;hall be manife&s;t.</Q> So the gaoler led me out of the court; and the people were generally tender, as if they had been in a meeting. Soon after I was brought in again, and the jury found the bill again&s;t me, which I traver&s;ed. Then I was a&s;ked to put in bail till the next &s;e&s;&s;ions, and the gaoler's &s;on offered to be bound for me. But I &s;topped him, and warned friends not to meddle, for I told them, 'There was a &s;nare in that;' yet I told the ju&s;tices, I could promi&s;e to appear if the Lord gave health and &s;trength, and I was at liberty. Some of the ju&s;tices were loving, and would have &s;topped the re&s;t from indict|ing me or putting the oath to me; but judge Street the chairman &s;aid, 'He mu&s;t go according to law.' So I was &s;ent to pri&s;on again; yet within two hours after, through the moderation of &s;ome of the ju&s;tices, I had liberty given me till next quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions. The&s;e moderate ju&s;tices, as it
<PB N="190" REF="037441_0706_100D92DB43296ED8">was &s;aid, de&s;ired ju&s;tice Parker to write to the king for my liberty, or for a Noli pro&s;equi, becau&s;e they were &s;atisfied I was not &s;uch a dangerous per&s;on as I had been repre&s;ent|ed. This, it was &s;aid, he promi&s;ed to do, but did it not.</P>
<P>After I had got a copy of the indictment, I went to Lon|don, vi&s;iting friends as I went. When I came there, &s;ome that were earne&s;t to get me out of the hands of tho&s;e envious ju&s;tices that &s;ought to premunire me at Worce&s;ter, would needs be tampering again, to bring me before the judges of the King's Bench; whereupon I was brought again by an Habeas Corpus before them. I tendered them a paper, in which was contained what I could &s;ay in&s;tead of the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THIS I do in the truth and in the pre&s;ence of God de|clare, That king Charles the Second is lawful king of this realm, and of all other his dominions; that he was brought in and &s;et up king <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver this realm by the power of God; and I have nothing but love and good will to him and all his &s;ubjects, and de&s;ire his pro&s;perity and eternal good.

<P>But the bu&s;ine&s;s being &s;o far proceeded in at Worce&s;ter, they would not meddle in it, but left me to appear again before the ju&s;tices at the next general quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions at Worce&s;ter.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the yearly meeting of friends came on, at which I was pre&s;ent; and exceeding glorious the meetings were, beyond expre&s;&s;ion; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord!</P>
<P>After the yearly meeting, I &s;et forward for Worce&s;ter, the &s;e&s;&s;ions drawing on, which were held in the fifth month.
<PB N="191" REF="037441_0707_100D92DD10385030">When I was called to the bar, and the indictment read, &s;ome &s;cruple ari&s;ing among the jury concerning it, the judge of the court, ju&s;tice Street, cau&s;ed the oaths to be read and tendered to me again. I told him, <Q>I came now to try the traver&s;e of my indictment; and that his tendering me the 'oaths anew, was a new &s;nare. I de&s;ired him to an&s;wer me a que&s;tion or two; and a&s;ked him, Whether the oaths were to be tendered to the king's &s;ubjects, or to the &s;ub|jects of foreign princes?</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>To the &s;ubjects of this realm.</Q> 'Then,' &s;aid I, <Q>You have not named me a &s;ubject in the indictment, and therefore have not brought me within the &s;tatute.</Q> The judge cried, <Q>Read the oath to him.</Q> I &s;aid, 'I require ju&s;tice.' Again I a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether the &s;e&s;&s;ions ought not to have been holden for the king, and the body of the county?</Q> He &s;aid, 'Yes.' 'Then,' &s;aid I, you have there left the king out of the in|dictment; <Q>how then can you proceed upon this indictment to a trial between the king and me, &s;eeing the king is left out?</Q> He &s;aid, 'The king was in before.' But I told 'him, <Q>The king's name being left out, here was a great error in the indictment, and &s;ufficient, as I was informed to qua&s;h it. Be&s;ides, I told him that I was committed by the name of George Fox of London, but now I was indicted by the name of George Fox of Tredington in the county of Worce&s;ter. I wi&s;hed the jury to con&s;ider how they could find me guilty upon that indictment, &s;ee|ing I was not of the place the indictment mentioned.</Q> The judge did not deny but there were errors in the indict|ment; but &s;aid, 'I might take my remedy in its proper 'place.' I an&s;wered, 'You know that we are a people that '&s;uffer all things, and bear all things; and therefore ye 'thus u&s;e us, becau&s;e we cannot revenge our&s;elves; but we 'leave our cau&s;e to the Lord.' The judge &s;aid, 'The oath 'hath been tendered to you &s;everal times, and we will have '&s;ome &s;atisfaction from you concerning the oath.' I offer|ed them the &s;ame declaration in&s;tead of the oath, which I had offered to the judges above; but it would not be ac|cepted. Then I de&s;ired to know, &s;eeing they put the oath anew to me, whether the indictment was qua&s;hed or no? In|&s;tead of an&s;wering me, the judge told the jury, 'They 'might go out.' Some of the jury were not &s;atisfied; whereupon the judge told them, 'They had heard a man '&s;wear that the oath was tendered to me the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions;' and then directed what they &s;hould do, I told him, <Q>He
<PB N="192" REF="037441_0708_100D92E023BD42F0">&s;hould leave the jury to their own con&s;ciences.</Q> However, the jury, being put on by him, went forth, and &s;oon after came in again, and found me guilty. I a&s;ked them, <Q>How they could &s;atisfy them&s;elves to find me guilty upon that indictment, which was laid &s;o fal&s;e, and had &s;o many er|rors in it?</Q> They could make but little an&s;wer; yet one who &s;eemed to be the wor&s;t of them, would have taken me by the hand: but I put him by, &s;aying, <Q>How now, 'Ju|das, ha&s;t thou betrayed me, and do&s;t thou now come with a ki&s;s?</Q> So I bid him and them repent. Then the judge began to tell me, <Q>How favourable the court had been to me.</Q> I a&s;ked him, <Q>How he could &s;ay &s;o? Was ever any man wor&s;e dealt by than I had been in this ca&s;e, who was &s;topped in my journey when travelling upon my law|ful occa&s;ions, and impri&s;oned without cau&s;e; and now had the oaths put to me only for a &s;nare? I de&s;ired him to an&s;wer me in the pre&s;ence of the Lord, in who&s;e pre|&s;ence we all are, whether this oath was not tendered to me in envy?</Q> He would not an&s;wer that; but &s;aid, <Q>Would you had never come here, to trouble us and the country!</Q> I an&s;wered, <Q>I came not thither of my&s;elf, but was brought, being &s;topped in my journey. I did not trouble them, but they had brought trouble upon them|&s;elves.</Q> Then the judge told me, <Q>What a &s;ad &s;entence he had to tell me.</Q> I a&s;ked him, <Q>Whether what he was going to &s;peak was by way of pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence, or for in|formation? For I told him I had many things to &s;ay, and more errors to a&s;&s;ign in the indictment, be&s;ides tho&s;e I had already mentioned, to &s;top him from giving &s;entence again&s;t me upon that indictment.</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>He was go|ing to &s;hew me the danger of a premunire, which was the lo&s;s of my liberty and of all my goods and chattels, and to &s;uffer impri&s;onment during life.</Q> But he &s;aid, <Q>He did not deliver this as the &s;entence of the court upon me, but as an admonition to me.</Q> Then he bid the gaoler <Q>Take me away.</Q> I expected to have been called again to hear the &s;entence; but when I was gone, the Clerk of the peace (who&s;e name was Twittey) a&s;ked him, as I was informed, <Q>Whether that which he had &s;poken to me &s;hould &s;tand-for &s;entence?</Q> And he, con&s;ulting with &s;ome of the ju&s;tices, told him, 'Yes, that was the &s;entence, and &s;hould &s;tand' This was done behind my back, to &s;ave him&s;elf from &s;hame in the face of the country. Many of the ju&s;tices, and the generality of the people, were moderate and civil; and
<PB N="193" REF="037441_0709_100D92E25777C060">John A&s;hley, a lawyer, was very friendly both the time be|fore and now, &s;peaking on my behalf, and pleading the errors of the indictment for me; but ju&s;tice Street, the judge of the court, would not regard, but over-ruled all. This ju&s;|tice Street &s;aid to &s;ome friends in the morning before my trial, <Q>That if he had been upon the bench the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions, he would not have tendered me the oath; but if I had been convicted of being at a conventicle, he would have proceeded again&s;t me according to that law; and that he was &s;orry that ever I came before him;</Q> yet he maliciou&s;ly tendered the oath to me in the court again, when I was to have tried my traver&s;e upon the indictment. But the Lord pleaded my cau&s;e, and met with both him and ju&s;tice Simp|&s;on, who fir&s;t en&s;nared me with the oath at the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions; for Simp&s;on's &s;on was arraigned not long after at the &s;ame bar for murder. And Street, who, as he came down from London, after the judges had returned me back from the King's Bench to Worce&s;ter, &s;aid, <Q>Now I was returned to them, I &s;hould lie in pri&s;on and rot;</Q> had his daughter (whom he &s;o doted on that &s;he was called his idol) brought dead from London in an her&s;e to the &s;ame inn where he &s;poke tho&s;e words, and brought to Worce&s;ter to be buried within a few days after. People took notice of the hand of God, how &s;udden it was upon him; but it rather hardened than tendered him, as his carriage afterwards &s;hewed.</P>
<P>After I was returned to pri&s;on, &s;everal came to &s;ee me; among&s;t others, the earl of Sali&s;bury's &s;on, who was very loving, and troubled that they had dealt &s;o wickedly by me. He &s;taid about two hours with me, and took a copy of the errors of the indictment in writing.</P>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ions being now over, and I fixed in pri&s;on by a premunire, my wife came out of the north to be with me; and the a&s;&s;izes coming on in the &s;ixth month, the &s;tate of my ca&s;e being drawn up in writing, &s;he and Thomas Lower delivered it to judge Wild. In it was &s;et forth the occa&s;ion of my journey, the manner of my being taken and impri&s;on|ed, the proceedings of the &s;everal &s;e&s;&s;ions again&s;t me, and the errors in the indictment by which I was premunired.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the KING.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE principle of the Quakers is the Spirit of Chri&s;t, who died for us, and is ri&s;en for our ju&s;tification; by which we know we are his. He dwelleth in us by his Spirit, and by the Spirit of Chri&s;t we are led out of un|righteou&s;ne&s;s and ungodline&s;s. It brings us to deny all plottings and contrivings again&s;t the king, or any man. The Spirit of Chri&s;t brings us to deny all manner of un|godline&s;s, as lying, theft, murder, adultery, fornication, all uncleanne&s;s, debauchery, malice, hatred, deceit, co|zening and cheating what&s;oever, and the devil and his works. The Spirit of Chri&s;t brings us to &s;eek the peace and good of all men, and to live peaceably, and leads us from &s;uch evil actions as the magi&s;trate's &s;word takes hold upon. Our de&s;ire and labour is, that all who profe&s;s them&s;elves Chri&s;tians may walk in the Spirit of Chri&s;t; that they through the Spirit may mortify the deeds of the fle&s;h, and by the &s;word of the Spirit may cut down &s;in and evil in them&s;elves. Then the judges and other ma|gi&s;trates would not have &s;o much work in puni&s;hing &s;in in the kingdom; neither then need kings or princes fear any of their &s;ubjects, if they all walked in the Spirit of Chri&s;t, for the fruits of the Spirit are love, righteou&s;ne&s;s, good|ne&s;s, temperance, &amp;c. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll that profe&s;s them&s;elves Chri&s;tians did walk in the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and by it did mortify &s;in and evil, it would be a great ea&s;e to the ma|gi&s;trates and rulers, and would free them from a great deal of trouble, for it would lead all <Q>to do unto others as they would have others do unto them,</Q> and &s;o the royal law of liberty would be ful&s;illed. For if all called Chri&s;tians did walk in the Spirit of Chri&s;t, by it to have the evil &s;pi|rit and its fruits mortified and cut down in them, then, not being led by the evil &s;pirit, but by the good Spirit of Chri&s;t, the fruits of the good Spirit would appear in all. For as people are led by the good Spirit of Chri&s;t, it leads them out of &s;in and evil, which the magi&s;trate's &s;word takes hold of, and &s;o would be an ea&s;e to the magi&s;trates. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t as people err from this good Spirit of Chri&s;t, and fol|low the evil &s;pirit, which leads them into &s;in and evil; that &s;pirit brings the magi&s;trate into a great deal of trou|ble,
<PB N="195" REF="037441_0711_100D7F95CE5098B8">to execute the law upon the &s;inners and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the good Spirit. That Spirit, which leads people from all manner of &s;in and evil, is one with the magi&s;trate's power, and with the righteous law; for the law being ad|ded becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that Spirit which leads out of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t needs be one with that law which is again&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. So that Spirit which leads out of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is the good Spirit of Chri&s;t, and is one with the magi&s;trates in the higher power, and owns it and them; but that &s;pirit which leads into tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is the bad &s;pi|rit, is again&s;t the law, again&s;t the magi&s;trates, and makes them a great deal of trouble&s;ome work. The manife&s;ta|tion of the good Spirit is given to every man to profit with|al; and no man can pro&s;it in the things of God but by the Spirit of God, which brings to deny all &s;in and evil. It is &s;aid of I&s;rael, Nehem. ix. <Q>The Lord gave them his good Spirit to in&s;truct them, yet they rebelled again&s;t it.</Q> If all people did mind this manife&s;tation of the Spi|rit which God hath given to in&s;truct them, it would lead them to for&s;ake all manner of &s;in and evil, enmity, hatred, malice, unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and ungodline&s;s, and to mortify it. Then in the Spirit of Chri&s;t they would have fellow|&s;hip and unity, which is the bond of peace; then would love and peace, which are the fruits of the good Spirit, flow among all that are called Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>We are a people, who, intenderne&s;s of con&s;cience to the command of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tle, cannot &s;wear; for we are commanded in Matth. v. and James v. to keep to Yea and Nay, and <Q>not to &s;wear at all; neither by hea|ven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath, le&s;t we go into evil, and fall into condemnation.</Q> The words of Chri&s;t are the&s;e: <Q>Ye have heard that it hath been &s;aid by (or to) them of old time, Thou &s;halt not for&s;wear thy|&s;elf, but &s;halt perform unto the Lord thine oaths.</Q> The&s;e were true and &s;olemn oaths, which tho&s;e who made ought to have performed in old time; but the&s;e Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tle forbad in the go&s;pel-times, as well as fal&s;e and vain oaths. If we could take any oath at all, we could take the oath of allegiance, knowing that king Charles was by the power of God brought into England, and &s;et up king of England, &amp;c. over the heads of our old per&s;ecutors; and as for the pope's &s;upremacy, we utterly deny it. And the apo&s;tle having commanded us not to &s;wear, but to keep to Yea and Nay, we dare not break their commands;
<PB N="196" REF="037441_0712_100D92E9239A5D58">therefore many knowing this have put the oaths to us as a &s;nare, that they might make a prey of us.

We de&s;ire therefore that the king would take this into con&s;ideration, al&s;o how long we have &s;uffered in this ca&s;e.

<P>About this time I had a &s;it of &s;ickne&s;s, which brought me very low and weak in my body; and I continued &s;o a pretty while, in&s;omuch that &s;ome friends began to doubt of my recovery, I &s;eemed to my&s;elf to be among&s;t the graves and dead corp&s;es; yet the invi&s;ible power did &s;ecretly &s;up|port me, and conveyed refre&s;hing &s;trength into me, even when I was &s;o weak that I was almo&s;t &s;peechle&s;s.

<P>Endeavours were u&s;ed to get me relea&s;ed, at lea&s;t for a time till I &s;hould grow &s;tronger; but the way of effecting it proving difficult and tedious (for the king was not willing to relea&s;e me by any other way than a pardon, being told he could not legally do it; and I was not willing to accept of a pardon, which he would readily have given me, becau&s;e I did not look upon that way as agreeable with the innocence of my cau&s;e) Edward Pitway, having occa&s;ion to &s;peak with ju&s;tice Parker upon bu&s;ine&s;s, de&s;ired him to give or|der to the gaoler, That, in regard of my weakne&s;s, I might have liberty to go out of the gaol into the city.

<P>After this, my wi&s;e went to London, and &s;poke to the king; <Q>laying before him my long and unju&s;t impri&s;on|ment, with the manner of my being taken, and the ju&s;tices proceedings again&s;t me, in tendering me the oath as a &s;nare, whereby they had premunired me: &s;o that I being now his pri&s;oner, it was in his power and at his plea&s;ure to relea&s;e me; which &s;he de&s;ired.</Q> The king &s;poke kindly to her, and referred her to the lord keeper; to whom &s;he went, but could not obtain what &s;he de&s;ired; for he &s;aid, <Q>The king could not relea&s;e me otherwi&s;e than by a par|don;</Q> and I was not free to receive a pardon, knowing I had not done evil. If I would have been freed by a par|don, I needed not have laid &s;o long; for the king was willing to have given me one long before; and told Tho|mas Moore, <Q>That I need not &s;cruple being relea&s;ed by a pardon, for many a man that was as innocent as a child had had a pardon granted him:</Q> yet I could not con&s;ent to accept one. For I had rather have lain in pri&s;on all my days, than come out in any way di&s;honourable to truth: wherefore I cho&s;e to have the validity of my indictment tried before the judges. Having fir&s;t the opinion of a coun&s;ellor upon it (Thomas Corbet of London, whom Richard Davis of Welchpool was well acquainted with, and recommended to me) an Habeas Corpus was &s;ent to Worce&s;ter, to bring me up once more to the King's Bench bar, for the trial of the errors in my indictment. The un|der-&s;heriff &s;et forward with me the fourth of the twelfth month, there being al&s;o in the coach the clerk of the peace, and &s;ome others. The clerk had been my enemy all along, and now &s;ought to en&s;nare me in di&s;cour&s;e; but I &s;aw, and &s;hunned him. He a&s;ked me, <Q>What I would do with the errors in the indictment?</Q> I told him, <Q>They &s;hould be tried, and every action &s;hould crown it&s;elf.</Q> He quarrel|led with me for calling their mini&s;ters prie&s;ts. I a&s;ked him, 'If the law did not call them &s;o?' He a&s;ked me, <Q>What I thought of the church of England? Were there no Chri&s;tians among them?</Q> I &s;aid, <Q>They are all called &s;o, and there are many tender people among&s;t them.</Q> We
<PB N="198" REF="037441_0714_100D92ECF623A268">came to London the eighth of the twelfth month, and the eleventh I was brought before the four judges at the King's Bench, where coun&s;ellor Corbet &s;tarted a new plea. He told the judges, <Q>They could not impri&s;on any man upon a premunire.</Q> Whereupon the chief ju&s;tice Hale &s;aid, <Q>Mr. Corbet, you &s;hould have come &s;ooner, at the begin|ning of the term, with this plea.</Q> He an&s;wered, <Q>We could not get a copy of the return and the indictment.</Q> The judge replied, <Q>You &s;hould have told us, and we would have forced them to have made a return &s;ooner.</Q> Then &s;aid judge Wild, <Q>Mr. Corbet, you go upon general terms; and if it be &s;o as you &s;ay, we have committed ma|ny errors at the Old Bailey, and in other courts.</Q> Corbet was po&s;itive that by law they could not impri&s;on upon a premunire. The judge &s;aid, <Q>There is &s;ummons in the &s;tatute.</Q> 'Yes,' &s;aid Corbet, <Q>but &s;ummons is not impri|&s;onment, for &s;ummons is in order to a trial.</Q> 'Well,' &s;aid the judge, <Q>we mu&s;t have time to look in our books, and con&s;ult the &s;tatutes.</Q> So the hearing was put off till next day.</P>
<P>The next day they cho&s;e rather to let this plea fall, and begin with the errors of the indictment; and when they came to be opened, they were &s;o many and gro&s;s, that the judges were all of opinion the <Q>indictment was qua&s;hed and void, and that I ought to have my liber|ty.</Q> There were that day &s;everal great men, lords and others, who had the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy tendered to them in open court, ju&s;t before my trial came on; and &s;ome of my adver&s;aries moved the judges that the oaths might be tendered again to me, telling them, 'I was a dangerous man to be at liberty.' But judge Hale &s;aid, <Q>He had indeed heard &s;ome &s;uch reports, but he had al&s;o heard many more good reports of me;</Q> &s;o he, with the re&s;t of the judges, ordered me to be freed by proclama|tion. Thus after I had &s;uffered impri&s;onment a year and almo&s;t two months for nothing, I was fairly &s;et at liberty upon a trial of the errors of my indictment, without receiv|ing any pardon, or coming under any obligation or en|gagement at all; and the Lord's everla&s;ting power went over all, to his glory and prai&s;e. Coun&s;ellor Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bet got great &s;ame by it; many of the lawyers told him, <Q>He had brought that to light which had not been known before, as to the not impri&s;oning upon a premunire;</Q> and after the trial a judge &s;aid to him, <Q>You have obtained a great
<PB N="199" REF="037441_0715_100D92EF0314BDF8">deal of honour by pleading George Fox's cau&s;e &s;o in court.</Q></P>
<P>During the time of my impri&s;onment in Worce&s;ter (not|with&s;tanding my want of health, and being &s;o often hurried to and fro to London and back) I wrote &s;everal books for the pre&s;s, one whereof was called, <Q>A warning to En|gland;</Q> another was, <Q>To the Jews, proving by the pro|phets, that the Me&s;&s;iah is come;</Q> another, <Q>Concerning in&s;piration, revelation, and prophecy;</Q> another, <Q>Again&s;t all vain di&s;putes;</Q> another, <Q>For all bi&s;hops and mini&s;|ters to try them&s;elves by the &s;criptures;</Q> another. <Q>To &s;uch as &s;ay, We love none but our&s;elves;</Q> another, inti|tuled, 'Our te&s;timony concerning Chri&s;t;' and another little book 'concerning Swearing,' being the fir&s;t of tho&s;e two given to the parliament. Be&s;ides the&s;e, I wrote many papers and epi&s;tles to friends, to encourage and &s;trengthen them in their &s;ervices for God, which &s;ome (who made pro|fe&s;&s;ion of truth, but had given way to a &s;educing &s;pirit, and were departed from the unity and fellow&s;hip of the go&s;|pel, in which friends &s;tand) endeavoured to di&s;courage them from; e&s;pecially in their diligent and watchful care for the well-ordering and managing the affairs of the church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Being at liberty, I vi&s;ited friends in London; and having been very weak, and not yet well recovered, I went to King&s;ton; and having vi&s;ited friends there, returned to London, wrote a paper to the parliament, and &s;ent &s;everal books to them. A great book again&s;t &s;wearing had been delivered to them a little before; the rea&s;onablene&s;s where|of had &s;o much influence, that it was thought they would have done &s;omething towards our relief if they had &s;at lon|ger. I &s;taid in and near London till the yearly meeting, to which friends came from mo&s;t parts of the nation, and &s;ome from beyond &s;ea. A glorious meeting we had in the everla&s;ting power of God.</P>
<P>This meeting over, and the parliament ri&s;en (who had done nothing for nor again&s;t friends) I was clear of my &s;er|vice for the Lord at London. And having taken my leave of friends there, and had a glorious meeting with &s;ome of them at John El&s;on's in the morning, I &s;et forward with my wi&s;e and her daughter Su&s;an by coach (for I was not able to travel on hor&s;eback) towards the north, many friends accompanying us as far as Highgate, and &s;ome to Dan&s;table, where we lodged that night. We vi&s;ited friends and were
<PB N="200" REF="037441_0716_100D93BA0803D1A0">vi&s;ited by them at Newport-Pagnel, Northampton, and Co&s;&s;el, where, among&s;t others, came a woman, and brought her daughter for me to &s;ee how well &s;he was; putting me in mind, <Q>That when I was there before, &s;he had brought her to me much troubled with the king's evil, and had then de&s;ired me to pray for her.</Q> Which I did, and &s;he mended upon it; prai&s;ed be the Lord! From Co&s;&s;el we went by John Simcock's and William Gandy's to Warring|ton, Pre&s;ton and Lanca&s;ter.</P>
<P>I had not been at Lanca&s;ter &s;ince I was carried pri&s;oner from thence by the under-&s;heriff and gaoler, towards Scar|borough ca&s;tle in York&s;hire. I found the town full of peo|ple; for it was fair-time, and the trained bands were met upon a general mu&s;ter. Many friends were al&s;o in town from &s;everal parts of the county, becau&s;e the quarterly meet|ing was to be there next day. I &s;taid two nights and a day at Lanca&s;ter, and vi&s;ited friends both at their men's and women's meetings, which were very full, large, and peace|able; for the Lord's power was over all, and none meddled with us. Here met us Thomas Lower and his wife, Sarah Fell, James Lanca&s;ter, and Leonard Fell. The next day after the meeting, the twenty-fifth of the fourth month, we went over the &s;ands, with &s;everal other friends to Swarth|more.</P>
<P>After I had been awhile at Swarthmore, &s;everal friends from divers parts of the nation came to vi&s;it me, and &s;ome out of Scotland; by whom I under&s;tood, four young &s;tu|dents of Aberdeen were convinced there this year, at a di&s;|pute held by Robert Barclay and George Keith with &s;ome of the &s;cholars of that univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>Among others, colonel Kirby paid me a vi&s;it, who had been one of my great per&s;ecutors; but now he &s;aid he came to bid me welcome into the country, and carried him&s;elf in appearance very lovingly; yet before I left Swarthmore he &s;ent for the con&s;tables of Ulver&s;tone, and ordered them to tell me, <Q>That we mu&s;t have no more meetings at Swarth|more; for if we had, they were commanded by him to break them up, and were to come the next fir&s;t-day.</Q> That day we had a very precious meeting, the Lord's pre|&s;ence was wonderful among&s;t us, and the con&s;tables did not come to di&s;turb us. The meetings have been quiet &s;ince, and have increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>The illne&s;s I got in my impri&s;onment at Worce&s;ter had &s;o much weakened me, it was long before I recovered my
<PB N="201" REF="037441_0717_100D7FA24B9A8CF0">natural &s;trength again. For which rea&s;on, and as I had many things lay upon me to write for public and private &s;ervice, I did not &s;tir much abroad during the time I now &s;taid in the north; but when friends were not with me, &s;pent pretty much time in writing books and papers for truth's &s;ervice. While I was at Swarthmore, I gave &s;everal to be printed; viz.</P>
<P>One, 'Concerning &s;wearing.'</P>
<P>Another, &s;hewing, <Q>That none are &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the prophets and apo&s;tles, but who &s;ucceed them in the &s;ame power and Holy Gho&s;t that they were in.</Q></P>
<P>Another, &s;hewing, <Q>That po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is above profe&s;&s;ion; and how the profe&s;&s;ors now do per&s;ecute Chri&s;t in &s;pirit, as the profe&s;&s;ing Jews did per&s;ecute him outwardly in the days of his fle&s;h.</Q></P>
<P>Another little book, 'To the magi&s;trates of Dantzick.'</P>
<P>Another, called, <Q>Cain again&s;t Abel; or, An an&s;wer to the New-England men's laws.</Q></P>
<P>Another, 'To friends at Nevis, concerning watching.'</P>
<P>Another, 'A general epi&s;tle to all friends in America.'</P>
<P>Another, 'Concerning Cae&s;ar's due, and God's due, &amp;c.'</P>
<P>Another, 'Concerning ordering of families.'</P>
<P>Another, intituled, 'The &s;piritual man judgeth all things.'</P>
<P>Another, 'Concerning the higher power.'</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, I wrote &s;everal epi&s;tles to friends, both in England and beyond the &s;eas; and an&s;wers to divers papers concerning the <Q>running out of &s;ome who had oppo&s;ed the order of the go&s;pel,</Q> had &s;tirred up a great deal of &s;trife and contention in We&s;tmoreland. Wherefore I was moved to write a few lines particularly to friends there.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>This is for friends in We&s;tmoreland:</HEAD>
<P>ALL live in the power of God, in his light and Spirit, which did fir&s;t convince you; that in it ye may keep in the ancient unity, in humility, in the fear of the Lord, and his gentle and peaceable wi&s;dom, which is ea&s;y to be intreated.

Let your faith &s;tand in the power of God, and not in the wi&s;dom of men's words, le&s;t ye fall.

<P>I al&s;o wrote the following general epi&s;tle to friends at the yearly meeting in London:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friends and brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHOM the Lord hath pre&s;erved by his eternal pow|er to this day, over and through many troubles, &s;torms, tempe&s;ts, and pri&s;ons. Let every one's faith &s;tand in the power of God, which is over the devil, and was be|fore him. Your faith &s;tanding in the invi&s;ible power of God, it &s;tands in that which does not change; and the faith that Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the power of God, is the author of, mu&s;t &s;tand in the power of God, &s;o then it &s;tands in that which is over all, in which they are e&s;tabli&s;hed. This the apo&s;tle brought the church, the true Chri&s;tians, to: and &s;o ought all the true Chri&s;tians faith now, which Chri&s;t is the author of, to &s;tand in the power of God, in which the everla&s;ting kingdom &s;tands. As every one's faith &s;tands in this power, it keeps all in the power of godline&s;s.</P>
<P>For as it was in the days of the apo&s;tles, when &s;ome were crying up Paul and Apollos, and &s;o forth, he judged them as carnal; and exhorted and admoni&s;hed them that their faith &s;hould not &s;tand in men, nor in the words of man's wi&s;dom, but in the power of God. He &s;aid, <Q>He would not know the &s;peech of them, but the power among&s;t them, for the kingdom of God is not in word, but in pow|er.</Q> So it is to be now. Every one's faith mu&s;t &s;tand in the power of God, and not in men, nor their &s;peeches upon the good words. For we have &s;een by experience, when they begin to cry up men, and their faith &s;tands in them; &s;uch as would have people's faith to &s;tand in them, love popularity, and bring not people's faith to &s;tand in
<PB N="203" REF="037441_0719_100D92F462F858C8">the power of God. Such cannot exalt Chri&s;t; and when &s;uch fall, they draw a great company after them. There|fore the apo&s;tle would not know &s;uch after the fle&s;h, but them that were in the power and Spirit; and &s;truck down every one's faith that &s;tood in the words of man's wi&s;dom, that they might &s;tand in the power of God. So it mu&s;t be now. They who&s;e faith doth not &s;tand therein, cannot exalt his kingdom, that &s;tands in power; therefore every one's faith mu&s;t &s;tand in the power of God.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle denied popularity, when he judged the Corinthians for looking at Paul and Apollos, to be car|nal: &s;uch are carnal &s;till. Therefore all &s;hould know one another in the Spirit, life, and power, and look at Chri&s;t; this keeps all in humility. They, who&s;e faith &s;tands in men, will make &s;ects; as in the days of J. N. J. P. and others. The faith of &s;uch, Chri&s;t is not the author of; if he hath been, they have erred from it, and made &s;hip|wreck of it. All that are in the true faith, that &s;tands in the power of God, will judge them as carnal, and judge down that carnal part in them, that cries up Paul or Apollos; that their faith may &s;tand in the power of God, and that they may exalt Chri&s;t, the author of it. For every one's eye ought to be to Je&s;us, and every ju&s;t man and woman may live by their faith, which Chri&s;t is the author and fini&s;her of. By this faith every man may &s;ee God, who is invi&s;ible; which faith gives the victory, and thereby he hath acce&s;s to God. So every one's faith and hope &s;tanding in the power of God, therein all have uni|ty, victory, and acce&s;s to God's throne of grace; in which faith they plea&s;e God. By this faith they are &s;aved, obe|tain the good report, and &s;ubdue all the mountains be|twixt them and God.</P>
<P>This power hath pre&s;erved friends over their per&s;ecu|tors, over the wrath of men, above the &s;poiling of their goods, and impri&s;onments; as &s;eeing God, that <Q>created all, gives the increa&s;e of all, and upholds all by his word and power.</Q> Therefore let every one's faith be in his power. In this no &s;chi&s;m nor &s;ect can come, for it is over them, before they were, and will be when they are gone. But perfect unity is in the truth, in the Spirit, that cir|cumci&s;eth the body of death, puts off the &s;ins of the fle&s;h, and plunges it down with the Spirit. In the Spirit of God there is perfect fellow&s;hip; and Chri&s;t is the mini&s;ter of this circumci&s;ion and bapti&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="037441_0720_100D92F5F8A97670">
This is upon me from the Lord to write unto you, that every one of you, who&s;e faith Je&s;us is the author of, may &s;tand in the power of God. From the Lord I warn you, and all every where of the &s;ame; for if a &s;tar &s;hould fall, which has been a light, either the earth or the &s;ea does receive it: that is, the earthly mind, or the foaming, raging people: though neither the &s;eed, light, power, nor truth ever fell, nor the faith it&s;elf, the gift of God; but men going from it, become un&s;avoury.</P>
<P>Adam, whil&s;t he kept in truth, and obeyed the com|mand of God, was happy; but when he di&s;obeyed the Lord, he &s;ell under the power of Satan, and became un|happy, though he might talk after of his experiences in pa|radi&s;e; but he had lo&s;t his image, and his power and do|minion, that God created him in.</P>
<P>The Jews, after they received the law, as long as they kept the law of God, which was ju&s;t, holy, good, and per|fect, it kept them good, ju&s;t, holy, and &s;avoury; but when they turned their backs on the Lord, and for&s;ook his law, they came under the power of darkne&s;s, under the powers of the earth, and were trodden under as un&s;avoury.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tians were called a <Q>city &s;et on a hill, the light of the world, and the &s;alt of the earth;</Q> but when they for&s;ook the power of God, and their faith &s;tood in words and men, and not in the power; then their walls fell down, though the power in it&s;elf &s;tood; and they lo&s;t their hill, their &s;altne&s;s, and their &s;hining, And as Chri&s;|tendom now confe&s;&s;eth, they are not in the &s;ame power and &s;pirit the apo&s;tles were in, &s;o not in the &s;ame &s;alt, nor up|on the &s;ame hill. So they came to be trod under, and the bea&s;t, the whore, and the fal&s;e prophet are uppermo&s;t, the un&s;avoury. Their dead faith is in men, and in words; therefore they are full of &s;ects, and one again&s;t another.</P>
<P>And now th e everla&s;ting go&s;pel, the power of God, is preached again, which was before the devil was, that dar|kened man; and by this power of God life and immortali|ty is come to light again; therefore every one's faith is to &s;tand in this power that hath brought life and immortality to light in them, and &s;o to be heirs of the power of God, the go&s;pel. Herein all have a right to the power of God, which is the authority of men's and women's meetings, and of all other meetings &s;et up thereby.</P>
<P>As the go&s;pel is preached again, if your faith doth not &s;tand in the power, but in men, and in the wi&s;dom of
<PB N="205" REF="037441_0721_100D92F805FA0B68">words, you will grow carnal; and &s;uch are for judgment, who cry up Paul or Apollos, and not Chri&s;t, the author of your faith. Tho&s;e that love to be popular would have people's faith &s;tand in them; &s;uch do not preach Chri&s;t, but them&s;elves. But &s;uch as preach Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel would have every man and woman to be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and every man and woman's faith to &s;tand in Chri&s;t, the author of it, and in the power of God, in which, as their faith &s;tands, nothing can get betwixt them and God; for if any &s;hould fall among&s;t us, as too many have done, that leads its followers either into the waters or into the earth.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould go from the &s;pirit of prophecy, that did open them, and from the power, they may &s;peak tho&s;e ex|periences the power opened to them formerly. So might Adam and Eve &s;peak of what they &s;aw and enjoyed in pa|radi&s;e; &s;o might Cain and Balaam, of what they &s;aw; and al&s;o the Jews, Corah, and Dathan, who prai&s;ed God on the banks, &s;aw the victory over Pharaoh, ate of the man|na, drak of the rock, came to mount Sinai, and &s;aw the glory of the Lord. So might the fal&s;e apo&s;tles &s;peak of their experiences, and all tho&s;e fal&s;e Chri&s;tians that turned from the apo&s;tles and Chri&s;t. So may &s;uch do now, that err from the Spirit, that are come out of &s;piritual Egypt and Sodom, and have known the raging of the Sodomites, as Lot did the outward; and the pur&s;uit of the &s;piritual Egyptians, as the outward Jew did the outward Egypti|ans; yet if they do not walk in the Spirit of God, in the light, and in the grace, which keeps their hearts e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, their words &s;ea&s;oned, and their faith in the power of God, in which the kingdom &s;tands, they may go forth like the fal&s;e Chri&s;tians, like the Jews, like Adam and Eve, Cain, Corah, and Balaam and be wandering &s;tars, trees without fruit, wells without water, and clouds with|out rain; and &s;o come to be un&s;avoury, trodden down, and as Adam who lo&s;t paradi&s;e, and the Jews who lo&s;t the Holy Land, not walking in the law, and keeping the command of God; and as the Chri&s;tians who lo&s;t the ci|ty, the hill, the &s;alt, and the light, &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, and came to be un&s;avoury, and to be trodden under foot of men.</P>
<P>Therefore let every one's faith &s;tand in the Lord's pow|er, which is over all, through which they may be built up|on the rock, the foundation of God, the &s;eed Je&s;us Chri&s;t.
<PB N="206" REF="037441_0722_100D92FA91CB11A8">So all in Chri&s;t may be ever fre&s;h and green; for he is the green tree that never withers, all are fre&s;h and green that are grafted in him, abide in him, and bring forth heavenly fre&s;h fruits to the prai&s;e of God.

They are no mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, nor of Chri&s;t, that oppo&s;e his power, which all are to po&s;&s;e&s;s. For the true mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, that preach his go&s;pel (which is to be preached to all nations) as deceit is gone over all nations, and all nations have drunk the whore's cup, and &s;he hath them in her cage, her unclean power from the bea&s;t and dragon, out of the power of God, and out of truth and the Spirit of God, the apo&s;tles were in; the power of God mu&s;t come over all this again; and all true mini&s;ters, that preach the go&s;pel, mu&s;t bring people into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it again. I &s;ay, who&s;oever preaches the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t and him to people and nations, tho&s;e people and nations receiving the go&s;pel, they receive the power of God, that brings life and immortality to light in them; and they &s;ee over the devil that hath darkened them, and the bea&s;t, the whore, and her cage. So by the pow|er of God, life and immortality is brought to light in them; then the&s;e men and women, being heirs of this pow|er, the go&s;pel, are heirs of authority and power over the devil, bea&s;t, whore, and dragon.</P>
<P>It is their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and portion, and they are to labour in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and portion, to do God Almighty's be&s;ne&s;s and &s;ervice in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the power of God, the go&s;pel, which is a joyful, glorious, everla&s;ting order.

All faith|ful men and women in every country, city, and nation, who&s;e faith &s;tands in the power of God, the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who have received the go&s;pel, and are in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, have all right to the power in the&s;e meet|ings, for they are heirs of the power, which is the authori|ty of the men's and women's meetings.</P>
<P>So here is God's choice (and not man's) by his power, of his heirs; and they have all freedom therein to go to the meetings, the men to the men's, and the women to the women's, for they are heirs of the power, which is receiv|ed in the Holy Gho&s;t; and they &s;ee over enmity, and be|fore it was, by the light, the life, and immortality, which is brought to light in them.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="037441_0724_100D92FE5001C740">
The devil, the author of enmity, cannot get into this authority, power, order, nor fellow&s;hip of the go&s;pel, nor life, nor light, nor into the unity of the faith, which gives victory over him that hath &s;eparated man from God. In|to the unity of this faith the &s;erpent cannot come, nor into the wor&s;hip of God in &s;pirit and truth the devil cannot come, nor any enmity. And they that are in this, are in unity over him. Therefore, let every one's faith &s;tand in the power of God, the glorious go&s;pel; all walk as be|comes the go&s;pel and the order of it. As every one hath received Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Lord, &s;o walk in him, and let him be their Lord and orderer. For the preaching of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t Je&s;us is to the intent that all might come to be heirs of the go&s;pel, into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, to be heirs of Chri&s;t and of his government, to the increa&s;e of which there is no end; who is over all in his righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and over all in his light, life, power, and dominion. Therefore know one another in his power, his go&s;pel; know one another in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who is able to re&s;tore man out of the &s;tate of the fall into the image of God, and into that power and dominion that man had before he fell, and into him&s;elf, that never fell, whence they &s;hall go no more forth. Here is the rock and foundation of God that &s;tands &s;ure.</P>
<P>And, friends, be tender to the tender principle of God in all. Shun the occa&s;ion of vain di&s;putes and janglings, both among&s;t your&s;elves and others; for that many times is like a blu&s;tering wind, that hurts and brui&s;es the tender buds and plants. For the world, though they have the words, are out of the life; and the apo&s;tle's di&s;puting with them was to bring them to the life. And tho&s;e di&s;|puters among the Chri&s;tians about genealogies, circum|ci&s;ion, the law, meats, drinks, and days, came to be the wor&s;t &s;ort of di&s;puters, whom the apo&s;tles judged; for &s;uch de&s;troyed people from the faith. Therefore did the apo&s;tles exhort the churches, that every one's faith &s;hould &s;tand in the power of God, and to look at Je&s;us the author of it. There every graft &s;tands in Chri&s;t, the vine, quiet, where no blu&s;tering &s;torms can hurt them; there is the &s;afety. There all are of one mind, one faith, one &s;oul, one &s;pirit, baptized into one body with the one &s;pirit, and made all to drink into one &s;pirit, one church, one head, that is heavenly and &s;piritual: and one faith in this head, Chri&s;t, who is the author of it, and hath the glory of it;
<PB N="209" REF="037441_0725_100D930021601CF8">one Lord to order all, who is the baptizer into this one body. So Chri&s;t hath the glory of his faith out of every man and woman; and the Father through him hath his glory, the Creator of all in his power, the go&s;pel that hath brought life and immortality to light in them; and their faith &s;tanding in it, they know the immortal God, &s;erve and wor&s;hip him in his &s;pirit and in his truth; by which they are made God's free men and women, from him that is out of the truth.</P>
<P>Now, friends, you that have been ancient labourers, and have known the dealings of the Lord the&s;e twenty years (more or le&s;s) as I have often &s;aid to you, draw up what you can of that which the Lord hath carried you through by his power, the pa&s;&s;ages and &s;ufferings, and how by the Lord ye have been &s;upported from the fir&s;t; &s;o that he may be exalted by his power now, and in ages to come, who hath been the only &s;upport, defence, and &s;tay of his people all along, over all to him&s;elf; to whom be all glory and prai&s;e for ever and ever. Amen. He de|&s;erves it in his church throughout all ages, from his living members, who return the prai&s;e to the living God, who lives and reigns over all, ble&s;&s;ed for ever; who is the life, &s;trength, health, and length of the days of his people. Therefore let there be no boa&s;ting, but in the Lord, in his power and kingdom; that keeps all in humility.</P>
<P>And friends, in the Lord's power and truth, what good you can do for friends in pri&s;on, or &s;ufferers, by informing or helping them, every one bend your&s;elves to the Lord's power and &s;pirit, to do his will and his bu&s;ine&s;s; and in that all will have a fellow-feeling of one another's condi|tions in bonds, or in what trials or tribulations &s;oever; you will have a fellow-feeling one of another, having one head, one Lord, and being one body in him. For God's heavenly flail hath brought out his &s;eed, his heavenly plough hath turned up the fallow ground, his heavenly &s;eed is &s;own by the heavenly man, which brings forth fruits to the heavenly &s;ower, in &s;ome fifty, &s;ixty, and an hundred fold in his life-time; and &s;uch in the world with|out end will have life everla&s;ting.

</LETTER>
<P>During this time, I collected together as many as I could of the epi&s;tles I had wrote in former years to friends. I made a collection too of the &s;everal papers I had wrote to Oliver Cromwel and his &s;on Richard, in the time of their protector&s;hips, and to the parliaments and magi&s;trates, in their times. I collected al&s;o the papers I had wrote to king Charles the Second &s;ince his return, and to his council and parliaments, and the ju&s;tices or other magi&s;trates under him. I made another collection of certificates, which I had received from divers governors of places, judges, ju&s;tices, parliament-men, and others, for the clearing of me from many &s;landers, which the envious prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors, both here and beyond &s;ea, had ca&s;t upon me. This I did for the truth's &s;ake, knowing that their de&s;ign in &s;landering me was to defame the truth publi&s;hed by me, and hinder the &s;preading thereof among&s;t the people. Be&s;ides the&s;e, I made two books of collections; one was, a li&s;t or cata|logue of the names of tho&s;e friends who went out of the north of England, when truth fir&s;t broke forth there, to proclaim the day of the Lord through this nation. The other was of the names of tho&s;e friends that went fir&s;t to preach the go&s;pel in other nations, countries, and places, in what years, and to what p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rts they went.</P>
<P>I made another collection, in two books; viz. one of
<PB N="213" REF="037441_0729_100D930A04DFB610">epi&s;tles and letters from friends and others, on &s;everal occa|&s;ions, to me; the other of letters of mine to friends and others.</P>
<P>I wrote al&s;o a book of the types and figures of Chri&s;t, with their &s;ignifications; and many other things, which will be of &s;ervice to truth and friends in time to come.</P>
<P>I took notice al&s;o of tho&s;e who had run out from truth, drawn others out after them, and turned again&s;t truth and friends, &s;ince the fir&s;t breaking forth of truth in this latter age, and what became of them; noting particularly the re|pentance and return of &s;uch of them as came back to truth again. Some ran quite out, and never returned, but were cut off in their gain&s;aying and rebellion; for the word and power of God hath bla&s;ted, and is bla&s;ting them, and the holy &s;eed hath ground, and is grinding them to pieces. I have ob&s;erved that they, who have been convinced, and have not lived and walked in the truth, have been the wor&s;t enemies to the truth, and done mo&s;t hurt among&s;t friends in the truth, and to others. In the&s;e I have &s;een fulfilled what the Lord did long &s;ince &s;hew me, <Q>That &s;uch would be greater deceivers than all the prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors.</Q> For &s;uch as came as far as Cain, Balaam, Corah, and Da|than, who could 'preach Chri&s;t,' and &s;ay, <Q>They had preached in his name;</Q> &s;uch as came to be apo&s;tles, and had ta&s;ted of the power of Chri&s;t, and then turned from it, &s;uch could yet &s;peak their old experiences, and have good words like Corah and Balaam; but not keeping in the life and truth, they deceived the hearts of the &s;imple. Such come to be of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">evil, who abode not in the truth; as Cain and all the Jews that abode not in the truth were. For though Cain did &s;acrifice to God, and did talk with God, and the Jews could talk of Abraham, Mo&s;es, and the pro|phets, yet Chri&s;t told them, <Q>They were of their father the devil.</Q> In like manner, though tho&s;e called Chri&s;tians can talk of Chri&s;t, and u&s;e his and his apo&s;tles and di&s;ciples words, yet not abiding in the truth, power, and &s;pirit the apo&s;tles were in, they are of the devil, out of truth, and do his work. So are all tho&s;e that have been convinced of God's eternal truth &s;ince it &s;prang up in this nation, that have not abode in the light, in the &s;pirit and power of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, but have turned again&s;t the power, and have oppo&s;|ed the work thereof; though they may retain their former experiences, and be able to &s;peak many good words, yet not living in the life and power that gave them tho&s;e experien|ces,

And as I had been moved of the Lord to travel in his power round this nation, and in other parts, to preach the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, and to declare the word of life, which was in the beginning, through many impri&s;onments, hard&s;hips, &s;ufferings, and trials: &s;o I was afterwards moved to travel in the &s;ame heavenly power about the nation again (and to write to &s;uch places where I came not) to recommend unto friends the <Q>&s;etting up of the quarterly and monthly meetings in all counties, for looking after the poor, taking care for orderly proceed|ings in marriages, and other matters relating to the church of Chri&s;t.</Q> Though &s;ome meetings for this end were &s;et|tled 'in the north of England in the year 1652.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>All my dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LIVE in the &s;eed of peace, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in whom ye have life. That &s;pirit, which comes among&s;t you to rai&s;e up &s;trife, is out of Chri&s;t; for it is the &s;pirit that is not ea&s;y to be intreated, not gentle, &s;o not of the wi&s;dom of God, which is ju&s;tified of her children. They that follow that &s;pirit are none of wi&s;dom's children. There is a &s;pirit that hath made a &s;eparation, and has been again&s;t men's and women's meetings; <Q>yet has &s;et up one of their own, which they have given power to; and that none &s;hall &s;it among&s;t them but whom they give power to, but &s;hall be looked upon as u&s;urpers of authority.</Q> This &s;pirit and its work is not of God, though it has made a jumble among&s;t &s;ome; and the path it may travel in is through the earthly affections, among&s;t the une&s;tabli&s;hed or apo&s;tates. But all that are in the life, &s;pirit, light, grace, truth, and power of God, bar it out; and &s;uch as &s;it under their own vine, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and are grafted into him, have no need of their exhortation or coun&s;el; for the true believers are entered into their re&s;t. Therefore all keep in the go&s;pel of peace, and they that be heirs of the kingdom keep your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof.</P>
<P>Some of this &s;pirit have &s;aid to me, <Q>They &s;ee no &s;er|vice in women's meetings.</Q> My an&s;wer is, and hath been to &s;uch, If they be blind and without &s;ight, they &s;hould not oppo&s;e others; for none impo&s;e any thing upon them, God never received the blind for a &s;acrifice, neither can his people. But Chri&s;t has enlightened all; and to as many as receive him, he gives <Q>power to become the &s;ons of God.</Q> Such as are heirs of his power, and of his go&s;pel, which brings life and immortality to light, can &s;ee over him that has darkened tho&s;e; and all &s;uch keep the order of the Go&s;pel, the power of God, and their meetings therein, which pre&s;erves them in life and immortality. The&s;e &s;ee the great &s;ervice of men's and women's meetings, in
<PB N="216" REF="037441_0732_100D9310F3679F48">the order of the go&s;pel, the power of God; for they are meet-helps in this power, which is the authority of their meetings. I &s;ay to all you that be again&s;t men's and wo|men's meetings, who &s;ay, <Q>you &s;ee no &s;ervice for the wo|men's meetings,</Q> and oppo&s;e them; you are therein out of the power of God, and his Spirit you live not in. For God &s;aw a &s;ervice for the a&s;&s;emblies of the women in the time of the law, about tho&s;e things that appertained to his wor&s;hip and &s;ervice, and to the holy things of his taber|nacle; and they in his Spirit &s;ee now their &s;ervice in the go&s;pel, many things in the&s;e meetings being more proper for the women than the men; and they, in the power and wi&s;dom of God, may inform the men of &s;uch things as are not proper for them; and the men may inform the women of &s;uch things as are not proper for them, as meet-helps to each other. For in the time of the law, the women were to offer as well as the men; &s;o in the time of the go&s;pel they are to offer their &s;piritual &s;acrifices; for they are all called, both men and women, a royal prie&s;thood, the hou&s;ehold of faith, the living &s;tones, that make up the &s;piritual building, which Chri&s;t is the head of; and are to be encouraged in their labour in the go&s;pel; for all things that both men and women do, are to be done in the power of God. Such as &s;ee no &s;ervice for the&s;e women's meetings, or the men's, but oppo&s;e them, and make &s;trife among friends, are in the &s;pirit of the world that is again&s;t and forbids our other meetings, in the &s;ame &s;pirit that hath been and is again&s;t women's &s;peaking in meetings, and &s;ay, <Q>They mu&s;t be &s;ilent,</Q> &amp;c. though the &s;ame apo&s;tle commands, <Q>That men &s;hould keep &s;ilence as well as the women,</Q> if there were not an interpreter. You may &s;ee the &s;pirit of the world hath entered &s;uch oppo&s;ers, though they come un|der another colour; for they would not have us to meet at all. The&s;e are again&s;t women's meetings, and &s;ome of them again&s;t men's al&s;o, and &s;ay, <Q>They &s;ee no &s;ervice for them;</Q> then they may hold their tongues, and not oppo&s;e them that do &s;ee their &s;ervice for God in the&s;e meetings.</P>
<P>Therefore all you that &s;eel the power of God, and your &s;ervice for God in them, both men and women, keep your meetings in the power of God, the authority of them, as they were &s;ettled in it; then ye will be pre&s;erved both over this &s;pirit that oppo&s;es them, and over the &s;pirit of the world that oppo&s;es your other meetings; for it is all
<PB N="217" REF="037441_0733_100D93129AE90DA8">one in the ground, and would bring you into bondage. Such as are out of the peaceable go&s;pel oppo&s;e its order; and out of the faith that works by love, out of the wi&s;dom that is gentle, ea&s;y, and peaceable, &amp;c. and out of the kingdom that &s;tands in peace and joy. Therefore keep over that &s;pirit that &s;ows di&s;cord or di&s;&s;en&s;ion, and would draw you from your habitation and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the order of the go&s;pel; for it is the &s;ame &s;pirit that deceived Adam and Eve, by which they lo&s;t their habitation in righteou&s;|ne&s;s and holine&s;s, and their dominion; &s;o that &s;pirit got over them, and it would get over you. One while it will tell you. "It &s;ees no &s;ervice for your meetings;" and ano|ther time oppo&s;e you. But I &s;ay, this is the blind &s;pirit which is out of the power of God, and which the power of God is over. Therefore keep in the power, that ye may &s;tand for your liberty in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, males and fe|males, heirs of him, of his go&s;pel, and his order. Stand up for your liberty in the go&s;pel, and in the faith, which Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath been the author of; for if ye lo&s;e it, and let another &s;pirit get over you, ye will not &s;oon regain it. I knew Satan would be&s;tir him&s;elf in his in&s;truments, when men's and women's meetings came to be &s;et up in the power, light, and truth, and the heirs of the go&s;|pel to take their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in every county and city, therein to walk, watch over one another, and take care of God's glory and honour, and his precious truth, and to &s;ee that all walk in the truth as becomes the go&s;pel, and to &s;ee that nothing was lacking; and &s;o what&s;oever was decent, mode&s;t, virtuous, lovely, comely, righteous, and of good report, to follow after; and to admoni&s;h and ex|hort all that were not faithful, and to rebuke all that did evil. I knew this would give &s;uch a check to all loo&s;e &s;peakers, talkers, and walkers, that there would be an op|po&s;ition again&s;t &s;uch meetings. But heed it not, truth will come over them all, and is over them all, and faith mu&s;t have the victory; for the go&s;pel and its order is everla&s;ting, the Seed (Chri&s;t) is the beginning and the ending, and will outla&s;t all; the Amen, in whom ye have peace. I &s;ay, all that oppo&s;e the men's and women's meetings, or that marriages &s;hould be laid before them, or the recording of condemnations of &s;in and evil, or admo|ni&s;hing or exhorting &s;uch as walk not in the truth, are of a loo&s;e &s;pirit, and their &s;pirits tend to loo&s;ene&s;s. Let tho&s;e take them that will; truth will not have them, nor any of
<PB N="218" REF="037441_0734_100D9315B1C24030">their &s;acrifice: for nothing is accepted of God but what is done in truth, and in his Spirit, which is peaceable. The authority of our men's and women's meetings is the power of God; all the heirs of the go&s;pel are heirs of that autho|rity and dignity; this is of God, and &s;hall an&s;wer the wit|ne&s;s of God in all. The greate&s;t oppo&s;ers of this practice and work are &s;uch as have been convinced of God's truth, but have not lived in it. Such were the greate&s;t troublers of the church in Mo&s;es's day, and in the days of the apo&s;|tles; but mark their end, and read what became of them all. Therefore all keep your habitation in the truth, and therein ye may &s;ee what became of all the oppo&s;ers of it for twenty years pa&s;t: they are all gone, and the truth lives and reigns; the Seed is over all, and all are one in it, in re&s;t, peace, and life everla&s;ting; and therein they &s;it down together in the heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Amen.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>While I was at Swarthmore, died William Lampit, prie&s;t of Ulver&s;tone (the pari&s;h that Swarthmore is in.) He was an old deceiver, and perverter of the right way of the Lord, and a per&s;ecutor of the people of God. Much conte&s;t I had with him when I fir&s;t came into tho&s;e parts. He had been an old fal&s;e prophet: for in the year 1652 be prophe|&s;ied (and &s;aid he would wage his life upon it) <Q>that the Qua|kers would all vani&s;h and come to nought within half a year:</Q> but he came to nought him&s;elf. For he continued in his fal&s;e accu&s;ing of God's people till a little before he died, and then cried for a little re&s;t. To one of his hearers, that came to vi&s;it him before he died, he &s;aid, <Q>I have been a preacher a long time, and thought I had lived well; but I did not think it had been &s;o hard a thing to die.</Q></P>
<P>After I had &s;ini&s;hed the &s;ervices which lay upon me then to do, &s;eeling my &s;pirit drawn towards the &s;outh (though I was but weak, and not able to travel far in a day) I left Swarthmore the twenty-&s;ixth of the fir&s;t month 1677, and went to Thomas Pear&s;on's at Powbank in We&s;tmoreland, where I had a meeting the next day; and from thence to Thomas Camm's at Camm's-gill, whither Robert Widders, with his wife and &s;everal other friends came to &s;ee me be|fore I left the country, and to attend the meeting there the
<PB N="219" REF="037441_0735_100D9317B41B0510">next day, which was very large, and in which I was largely drawn forth in te&s;timony to the truth. I had much di&s;|cour&s;e with &s;ome of that meeting, who were not in unity with the quarterly meeting they belonged to: but after|wards &s;everal of them, that were &s;omewhat tender, came to &s;ee their error, and gave forth condemnations again&s;t them|&s;elves. Next day John Blaykling came to Thomas Camm's, to bring me to his hou&s;e at Drawell in Sedberg in York|&s;hire; whither I went with him, vi&s;iting friends in the way. I &s;taid at Drawell two or three nights, having meetings there and thereabouts: for while I was there, the men's and women's meetings were held, which were very large and precious. The fir&s;t-day following I had a meeting at Brig-flats, to which mo&s;t of the friends from the &s;everal meetings round, with a great concour&s;e of other people, came; it was thought there were five or &s;ix hundred people. A very good meeting it was, wherein truth was largely declared and preciou&s;ly opened, to the comforting and refre&s;hing the faithful, and the drawing near them that were afar off. I had another meeting at John Blaykling's, where came many friends that were going to the quarterly meeting at Kendal: with them my wife went back (who with her daughter Ra|chel had accompanied me thus far;) and I, having Leonard Fell with me, pa&s;&s;ed through Sedberg and Gar&s;dale into Wen&s;ydale, vi&s;iting friends as we went. At night I reach|ed Richard Robin&s;on's at Counter&s;ide, where &s;everal friends came to me that evening; &s;ome of whom went with me next day to the widow Tenant's at Scarhou&s;e in Lang&s;troth-dale, whither we had much ado to get, the &s;now lay &s;o deep, though it was a week in the &s;econd month. Here on fir&s;t-day we had a large meeting, friends coming to it from &s;eve|ral parts round about; and the Lord gave me a very &s;ea|&s;onable te&s;timony to bear among&s;t them, which I did for &s;everal hours, to their great &s;atisfaction and comfort. Thence pa&s;&s;ing through Bi&s;hop&s;dale, Mildum, Barton, and by Be|dal and Northallerton, I came to George Robin&s;on's at Burrowby, where al&s;o friends coming from &s;everal parts, we had a very large and good meeting, and very peaceable. Not long after, an envious ju&s;tice, hearing I had a great meeting there, troubled friends about is, and made them appear at the &s;e&s;&s;ions, where he a&s;ked them many en&s;naring que&s;tions; for he knew not how to convict them, becau&s;e he had no proof again&s;t them. When he &s;aw his que&s;tions did not catch them, he told them, <Q>He had heard that
<PB N="220" REF="037441_0736_100D9319D46DC838">George Fox was at a large meeting with them, and they all &s;at &s;ilent, and none &s;poke in the meeting.</Q> This fal&s;e &s;tory he cunningly feigned, thinking thereby to have drawn &s;ome of the friends to have contradicted him, and have &s;aid, 'That I had &s;poke in the meeting;' that he might have convicted them upon their own confe&s;&s;ion, and have fined them. But friends &s;tanding in the wi&s;dom of God, did not an&s;wer him according to his de&s;ire, and &s;o e&s;caped his &s;nare. But two friends that came out of Ireland having a meeting that evening about three miles off this evil-minded ju&s;tice got information thereof, and fined friends, and plun|dered them very &s;orely for it.</P>
<P>I went from Burrowby to I&s;aac Lindley's, calling upon friends as I went. Robert Lodge, and &s;ome friends with me, next day pa&s;&s;ed to York; and the day following, being fir&s;t-day, I was at friends meeting at York, which was large and peaceable. The &s;econd day al&s;o I &s;taid in York, and had two meetings with friends at John Taylor's, from whence I wrote to my wife, as followeth:</P>

My de&s;ires are, that ye all may be pre&s;erved in the Lord's everla&s;ting Seed, in whom ye will have life and peace, dominion, and &s;ettle|ment in the everla&s;ting home or dwelling, in the hou&s;e built upon the foundation of God. In the power of the Lord I am brought to York, having had many meetings in the way. The way was many times deep and bad with &s;now, our hor&s;es &s;ometimes were down, and we were not able to ride; &s;ometimes we had great &s;torms and rain, but by the power of the Lord I went through all. At Scarhou&s;e was a very large meeting, and another at Burrowby, to which friends came out of Cleveland and Bi&s;hoprick; and many other meetings we have had. At York ye&s;terday we had a very large meeting, exceedingly thronged, friends being at it from many parts, and all quiet, and friends well &s;atis|fied: Oh! the glory of the Lord &s;hined over all. This day we had a large men's and women's meeting, many friends, both men and women, and all was quiet. This evening we are to have the men's and women's meeting of the friends of the city. John Whitehead is here, with Robert Lodge and others: friends are mighty glad, above mea&s;ure. So I am in my holy element, and holy work

<P>Leaving York, I vi&s;ited friends at Tadca&s;ter, Nottingly, Donca&s;ter, and Balby, having meetings as I went. At Balby I &s;taid the fir&s;t-day meeting, and went next day to Thomas Stacy's at Ballowfield, where in the evening I had a meeting, to compo&s;e a difference that had happened be|tween &s;ome that profe&s;&s;ed truth, and they were reconciled. Next day I came to Stain&s;by in Derby&s;hire, in which coun|ty I had formerly lived, about the fir&s;t breaking forth of truth. Here I had a good meeting with friends, and after|wards pa&s;&s;ed to Skegby in Nottingham&s;hire, and from thence to Nottingham, to John Reckle&s;s's. I had a meeting with friends at his hou&s;e that evening, and another the next day in friends publick meeting-hou&s;e, which was peaceable and well.</P>
<P>I went the day following to John Fox's at Wyme&s;would in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, where I had a meeting that evening: and next day to William Smith's at Sileby, where, it being fir&s;t-day, we had a very large meeting: for be&s;ides friends from &s;everal places, many of the town's-people, hearing I was there, came to the meeting, and heard the truth declar|ed gladly. Next day I went to Leice&s;ter, where finding many friends come out of the country, to be at the hor&s;e|fair next day, I had a very good meeting with them that night, and another next evening at William Wells's at Knighton, about a mile from Leice&s;ter. Next day I pa&s;&s;ed to Swanington, and had a meeting there: from thence to Samuel Fretwell's at Hart&s;horn in Derby&s;hire, where I had a meeting al&s;o; then to Henry Sidon's at Badgely in War|wick&s;hire, and &s;taid the meeting there, which, being the fir&s;t-day, was very large and peaceable, notwith&s;tanding a ju&s;tice had threatened to come and break it up. I went in
<PB N="222" REF="037441_0738_100D931E8052FA30">the evening to Richard Baal's of Whittington, where &s;eve|ral friends came to vi&s;it me. Next day I went to Nathani|el Newton's at Hart&s;hill, where &s;everal friends met me, with whom I had good &s;ervice. After this I pa&s;&s;ed on, vi&s;iting friends in divers places, till I came to Dingley, where a meeting was appointed before, which was very numerous, and truth was largely opened to the people: the meeting was peaceable, and the people generally &s;ober; &s;aving that, while I was &s;hewing how chri&s;tendom (&s;o called) was gone from the pure religion that is underfiled, &amp;c. a man ru&s;hed out in a furious manner, and &s;aid, 'I deny that.' After this meeting, I went with Thornas Charles to his hou&s;e at Adingworth; and next day to Northampton, where I &s;taid the fir&s;t-day meeting, which was very large and peace|able. I had much &s;ervice among friends be&s;ides. Next day Edward Cooper of Northampton accompanied me to Olney in Buckingham&s;hire, where I &s;taid at James Brier|lie's, &s;everal friends coming to &s;ee me in the evening. Next day I went to a meeting at Turry in Bedford&s;hire, to which friends came from &s;everal parts. It was a very large meeting. Here I met with William Dew&s;berry, who after the meet|ing took me to his &s;on-in-law John Ru&s;h's of Kemp&s;ton, where I &s;taid with William that night and mo&s;t of the next day; pa&s;&s;ing thence towards the evening through Ampthill to Thomas Gamboll's of Bullocks-hill. William Dew&s;|berry went along with me, and &s;everal friends came to vi&s;it vs. Next day, pa&s;&s;ing through Luton, I went to Market-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">treet, William Dew&s;berry accompanying me part of the way, and the day following Leonard Fell. I had a meet|ing at Ken&s;worth, which was pretty large and peaceable; after which we vi&s;ited friends at Alban's, and next day at South Mims and Barnet. We came that night to the wi|dow Haly's at Gutter&s;hedge in Hendon, Middle&s;ex. Next day, being fir&s;t-day, we had a very large meeting there, &s;e|veral friends coming from London. I &s;taid &s;econd-day, and the third went to William Mead's hou&s;e at Highgate, with whom next day I went to London. It being fourth-day, I went to the meeting at Gracechurch-&s;treet, where friends and I were greatly refre&s;hed in each other in the Lord, and the Lord's power and Seed was &s;et over all; ble&s;&s;ed be his name for ever!</P>
<P>Thus it plea&s;ed the Lord to bring me &s;a&s;e to London, tho' much wearied; for tho' I rode not very far in a day, yet thro' weakne&s;s of body, continual travelling was hard to

Be&s;ides, I had not much re&s;t a-nights to refre&s;h na|ture, for I often &s;at up late with friends where I lodged, to inform and advi&s;e them in things wherein they were want|ing; and when I was in bed, I was often hindered of &s;leep by great pains in my head and teeth, occa&s;ioned, as I thought, by cold I had taken by riding often in the rain.

<P>In my journey I ob&s;erved a &s;lackne&s;s and &s;hortne&s;s in &s;ome that profe&s;&s;ed truth, in keeping up the ancient te&s;timo|ny of truth again&s;t tithes: for where-ever that &s;pirit got en|trance which wrought divi&s;ion in the church, and oppo&s;ed the men's and women's meetings, it weakened tho&s;e that re|ceived it in their te&s;timony again&s;t tithes. Wherefore I was moved of the Lord to give forth an 'Epi&s;tle to friends,' to &s;tir up the pure mind in them, and to encourage and &s;trengthen them in their chri&s;tian te&s;timony again&s;t that an|tichri&s;tian yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BE faithful to the Lord in your te&s;timony for Je&s;us, who hath ended the levitical prie&s;thood of Aaron that took tithes, and &s;ent his mini&s;ters to give freely that which they had received of him freely, without a bag or a &s;taff. Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples could not join with tho&s;e that made a trade of preaching. And as there was a te&s;timony to be borne again&s;t tho&s;e tithes which were commanded in the law for Levi and Aaron, &s;o there is a te&s;timony to be borne again&s;t tho&s;e tithes which have been &s;et up by man in the dark time of popery, and not &s;et up by God nor Chri&s;t. To cry again&s;t the prie&s;ts in words, and yet to give them means, and put into their mouths, that they may not prepare war again&s;t you, is a contradiction. Therefore take heed: for if the Lord ble&s;s you with out|ward creatures, and you be&s;tow them upon Baal's prie&s;ts, he may ju&s;tly require the outward things from you again which he hath given you; who &s;aith, That his mini&s;ters &s;hould freely give, as they have freely received. So all the preachers for tithes and money, and the takers and payers of tithe, mu&s;t be te&s;tified again&s;t in the Lord's power and Spirit; that all may &s;tand up in their te&s;timo|ny for Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in his power and &s;pirit, again&s;t the tithe-mongers. Con&s;ider how many &s;aithful &s;ervants and valiants of the Lord have laid down their lives again&s;t
<PB N="224" REF="037441_0740_100D93226DFD9328">them, in this day of the Lord; and in the days of the martyrs they did witne&s;s again&s;t them. Con&s;ider al&s;o what judgments have come upon tho&s;e that &s;poiled friends goods, and ca&s;t them into pri&s;on for tithes and mainte|nance. Therefore in the power of the Lord maintain the war again&s;t the bea&s;t, and do not put into his mouth, le&s;t he cry peace to you; which peace you mu&s;t not receive, but it mu&s;t be broken and thrown out by the Spirit of God. Then in the &s;ame Spirit ye will receive the peace from the Son of peace, which the bea&s;t, the whore, and the world, with all their earthly teachers for the earth, made by man, cannot receive nor bereave you of. There|fore keep your authority and dominion in the power, Spi|rit, and name of Je&s;us, in whom is my love to you.</P>

<P>I came to London ten or twelve days before the yearly meeting; in which time I fell in with friends there in the &s;ervice of truth, vi&s;iting them at the meetings. The par|liament then &s;itting, we prepared &s;omething to lay before them, concerning &s;eizing the third part of friends e&s;tates, as Popi&s;h recu&s;ants; which was a great &s;uffering, and a griev|ance we complained of; but no redre&s;s we got.</P>
<P>To the yearly meeting many friends came from mo&s;t parts of the nation, and &s;ome out of Scotland, Holland, &amp;c. Very glorious meetings we had, wherein the Lord's power|ful pre&s;ence was very largely felt, and the affairs of truth were &s;weetly carried on in the unity of the Spirit, to the &s;atisfaction and comfort of the upright-hearted; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for ever! After the yearly meeting, having &s;taid a week or two with friends in London, I went with William Penn to his hou&s;e in Su&s;&s;ex; John Burnyeate and &s;ome other friends being with us. As we pa&s;&s;ed through Surry, hearing the quarterly meeting for the county was that day, William Penn, John Burnyeate, and I went from the road to it; and after the meeting returning to our other com|pany, went with them to William Penn's that night, which is forty miles from London. I &s;taid at Worminghur&s;t about three weeks, in which time John Burnyeate and I an&s;wered a very wicked and envious book, which Roger Williams, a prie&s;t of New-England (or &s;ome colony thereabouts; had written again&s;t truth and friends. When we had fini&s;hed that &s;ervice, we went with Stephen Smith to his hou&s; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="225" REF="037441_0741_100D932472A42068">Warpledon in Surry, where we had a large meeting. Friends thereaway had been exceedingly plundered about two months before on the prie&s;t's account; for they took from Stephen Smith five kine (being all he had) for about fifty &s;hillings tithes. From thence we went to King&s;ton, and &s;o to London, where I &s;taid not long: for it was upon me from the Lord to go into Holland, to vi&s;it friends and to preach the go&s;pel there and in &s;ome parts of Germany. Wherefore &s;etting things in order for my journey as fa&s;t as I could, I took leave of friends at London, and with &s;everal other friends went down to Colche&s;ter in E&s;&s;ex, in order to my pa&s;&s;age for Holland. Next day, being fir&s;t-day, I was at the publick meeting of friends there, which was very large and peaceable. In the evening I had another large meeting, but not &s;o publick, at John Furly's hou&s;e, where I lodged. The day following was the women's meeting, which was al&s;o very large. Next day we pa&s;&s;ed to Har|wich, where Robert Duncon, and &s;everal other friends came to &s;ee us; and &s;ome from London that intended to go over with me. The packet-boat not being ready, we went to the meeting in the town, and a precious opportu|nity we had together; for the Lord, according to his wont|ed goodne&s;s, by his overcoming, refre&s;hing power, opened many mouths to declare his everla&s;ting truth, and to prai&s;e and glorify him. After the meeting, we returned to John Vandewall's, where I had lodged; and when the boat was ready (taking leave of friends) we that were bound for Hol|land went on board about the 9th hour in the evening, the 25th of the 5th month, 1677.</P>
<P>The friends that went over with me were William Penn, Robert Barclay, George Keith and his wife, John Furly and his brother, William Tailcoat, George Watts, and I&s;abel Yeomans, one of my wife's daughters. About the fir&s;t hour in the morning we weighed anchor, having a fair, bri&s;k wind, which by the next morning brought us within &s;ight of Holland. But that day proving very clear and calm, we got forward but little till about the fourth hour in the afternoon, when a fre&s;h gale aro&s;e, which car|ried us within a league of land. Then being becalmed, we ca&s;t anchor for that night between the hours of nine and ten in the evening. But William Penn and Robert Bar|clay (under&s;tanding Benjamin Furly was come from Rot|terdam to the Briel to meet us) got two of the boatmen to let down a &s;mall boat that belonged to the packet, and
<PB N="226" REF="037441_0742_100D932652F7AEB0">row them to &s;hore: but before they could reach it, the gates were &s;hut; and there being no hou&s;e without the gate, they were fain to lie in a fi&s;her's boat all night. As &s;oon as the gates were opened in the morning, they went in, and found Benjamin Furly, with other friends of Rotterdam, come to receive us; and they &s;ent a boat, with three young men in it, that lived with Benjamin Furly, who brought us to the Briel, where the friends received us with great gladne&s;s.</P>
<P>We &s;taid about two hours to refre&s;h our&s;elves; and then took boat, with the Holland friends, for Rotterdam, where we arrived about the eleventh hour that day, the 28th of the fifth month 1677. I was very well this voyage, but &s;ome of the friends were &s;ea-&s;ick. A fine pa&s;&s;age we had, and all came &s;afe and well to land; ble&s;&s;ed and prai&s;ed be the name of the Lord for ever!</P>
<P>The next day, being fir&s;t-day, we had two meetings at Benjamin Furly's, where many of the town's-people and &s;ome officers came in, and all were civil. Benjamin Furly or John Claus interpreted, when any friend declared. I &s;pent the next day in vi&s;iting friends. The day following, William Penn and I, with other friends, went towards Am|&s;terdam, with &s;ome of that city, who came to Rotterdam to conduct us thither. We took boat in the afternoon, and, pa&s;&s;ing by Overkirk, came to Delft, through which we walk|ed on foot; and then took boat again to Leyden, where we lodged that night at an inn. This is counted &s;ix Dutch miles from Rotterdam, which are eighteen Engli&s;h miles, and five hours &s;ail, or travelling; for our boat was drawn by an hor&s;e that went on the &s;hore. Next day taking boat again, we went to Harlem, fourteen miles from Leyden, where we had appointed a meeting, which proved very large. Many of the town's-people came in, and two of their preach|ers. The Lord gave us a ble&s;&s;ed opportunity, not only with re&s;pect to friends, but to other &s;ober people, and the meeting ended peaceably and well. After meeting we pa&s;|&s;ed to Am&s;terdam, accompanied by &s;everal friends of that city and of Alkmaer.</P>
<P>Next day was the quarterly meeting at Am&s;terdam, to which came friends from Harlem, and Rotterdam, and with them tho&s;e of our company, whom we had left at Rotter|dam, viz. Robert Barclay, George Keith and his wife, &amp;c. The meeting was at Gertrude Dirick Nie&s;on's. A very large and &s;erviceable meeting it was. William Penn and I were drawn to open many things concerning the order of
<PB N="227" REF="037441_0743_100D932A07547ED0">the go&s;pel, and to &s;hew the benefit and &s;ervice of yearly, quarterly and monthly meetings of men and women. We had another meeting at Gertrude's the next day, more pub|lick, and very large, at which were profe&s;&s;ors of &s;everal &s;orts, unto whom the way of life and &s;alvation was largely and livingly opened; which they hearkened very attentively to, none making any objection to what was declared. In the afternoon we had another meeting in the &s;ame place, but le&s;s, and more private. The day following we had a meet|ing of friends only, wherein by joint agreement were &s;ettled &s;everal meetings, to wit, monthly, quarterly, and a yearly meeting, to be held at Am&s;terdam for friends in all the United Provinces of Holland, and in Embden, the Palati|nate, Hamburgh, Frederick&s;tadt, Dantzick, and other pla|ces in and about Germany; which friends were very glad of, and it hath been of great &s;ervice to truth.</P>
<P>Next day an exerci&s;e came upon me concerning that de|ceitful &s;pirit which wrought in &s;ome to make divi&s;ions in the church, and the care of the churches being upon me, I was moved to write a few lines to warn friends of it, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL friends, keep over that &s;pirit of &s;eparation and di|vi&s;ion, in the peaceable truth, and in the Seed of life, which will wear it all out, and outla&s;t it. For the Lamb will have the victory over all the &s;pirits of &s;trife, as it hath had &s;ince the beginning; and they will wither, as others have done: but all that keep in the Seed, which is always green, &s;hall never wither; as friends have been to this day kept. If any have back&s;lidden, thrown off the cro&s;s, grown loo&s;e and full, and gone into &s;trife and con|tention with their earthly &s;pirits, and therein plead for li|berty, this &s;pirit taketh with loo&s;e, earthly &s;pirits, and cries impo&s;ition to &s;uch as admoni&s;h them to come to the life, light, Spirit, and power of God, that they may be made alive, and live again with the living. Upon this ad|monition their &s;pirits ri&s;e into contention, &s;trife, and &s;epa|ration, turning again&s;t the living, in their loo&s;e earthly &s;pirits, which would have the name of truth, but are not in the nature of it, but are for eternal judgment of the liv|ing Seed. This is it which doth deceive, but it is judged by that which doth undeceive and &s;ave.</P>

This being fir&s;t-day, we had a very large meeting, there coming to it a great concour&s;e of people of &s;everal opinions, Bapti&s;ts, Seekers, Socinians, Browni&s;ts, and &s;ome of the Collegians. Robert Barclay, George Keith, William Penn and I, did all &s;everally declare the everla&s;ting truth among them; opening the &s;tate of man in the fall, and &s;hewing by what way man and woman may come into the re&s;toration by Chri&s;t Je&s;us. The my&s;tery of iniquity and the my&s;tery of godline&s;s were very plainly laid open, and the meeting ended quietly and well.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Prince&s;s Elizabeth,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE heard of thy tenderne&s;s towards the Lord and his holy truth, by &s;ome friends that have vi&s;ited thee, and al&s;o by &s;ome of thy letters, which I have &s;een; which indeed is a great thing, for a per&s;on of thy quality to have &s;uch a tender mind after the Lord and his precious truth, &s;eeing &s;o many are &s;wallowed up with voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, and the plea&s;ures of this world; yet all make an outward pro|fe&s;&s;ion of God and Chri&s;t one way or other, but without any deep inward &s;en&s;e and feeling of him. For it is not many mighty nor wi&s;e of the world that can become fools for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, or can become low in the humility of Chri&s;t Je&s;us from their mighty &s;tate, through which they might receive a mightier e&s;tate, and a mightier kingdom, through the inwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d holy Spirit, the divine light and power of God; and a mightier wi&s;dom, which is from above, pure and peaceable: which wi&s;dom is above that which is below, that is carthly, &s;en&s;ual, and devili&s;h, by which men de&s;|troy one another about their religions, ways, wor&s;hips, and churches: but this they have not from God nor Chri&s;t. The wi&s;dom which is from above, by which all things
<PB N="229" REF="037441_0745_100D932E0C6CE0B0">were made and created, which the holy fear of God in the heart is the beginning of, keeps the heart clean. By this wi&s;dom are all God's children to be ordered, and with it come to order all things to God's glory. This is the wi&s;|dom that is ju&s;tified of her children. In this fear of God and wi&s;dom, my de&s;ire is, that thou maye&s;t be pre&s;erved to God's glory. For the Lord is come to teach his people him&s;elf, and to &s;et up his en&s;ign, that the nations may flow unto it. There hath been an apo&s;tacy, &s;ince the apo&s;|tles days, from the divine light of Chri&s;t, which &s;hould have given them the <Q>light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</Q> and from the Holy Spirit, which would have led them into all truth; and therefore have people &s;et up &s;o many leaders without them, to give them knowledge; and al&s;o from the holy and pre|cious faith which Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the author and fini&s;her of, which faith puri&s;ies the heart, and gives victory over that which &s;eparates from God; through which faith they have acce&s;s to God, and in which faith they plea&s;e God, the my&s;tery of which is held in a pure con&s;cience. And al&s;o from the go&s;pel which was preached in the apo&s;tle's days (which go&s;pel is the power of God) which brings life and immortality to light in man and woman, by which people &s;hould have &s;een over the devil that has darkened them; which go&s;pel will pre&s;erve all them that receive it in life and immortality. For the eyes of people have been after men, and not after the Lord, who doth write his law in the hearts, and puts it into the minds of all the children of the new covenant of light, life, and grace; through which they all come to know the Lord, from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t: &s;o that the knowledge of the Lord may cover the earth, as the waters do the &s;ea. This work of the Lord is beginning again, as it was in the apo&s;tles days; people &s;hall come to receive an unction in them from the Holy One, by which they &s;hall know all things, and &s;hall not need any man to teach them, but as the anointing doth teach them; and al&s;o to know what the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith &s;peaks, the word nigh in the heart and mouth to obey it, and to do it. This was the word of faith the apo&s;tles preached; which is now received and preached again, and is the duty of all true Chri&s;tians to receive. So now peo|ple are coming out of the apo&s;tacy, to the light of Chri&s;t and his Spirit; to receive faith from him, and not from men; to receive the go&s;pel from him, their unction from
<PB N="230" REF="037441_0746_100D9330075E90F0">him, the Word; and as they receive him, they declare him freely, as his command was to his di&s;ciples, and is &s;till to the learners and receivers of him. For the Lord God and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come to teach his people, and to bring them from all the world's ways to Chri&s;t the way, the truth, and the life, who is the way to the Father; and from all the world's teachers and &s;peakers to him the &s;peak|er and teacher, as Heb. i. 1. and from all the world's wor&s;hippers, to wor&s;hip God in the Spirit and in the truth, which wor&s;hip Chri&s;t &s;et up above &s;ixtcen hundred years ago, when he put down the Jews wor&s;hip at the tem|ple at Jeru&s;alem, and the wor&s;hip at the mourtain where Jacob's well was; and to bring people from all the world's religions, which they have made &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, to the religion that was &s;et up by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, which is pure and unde&s;iled before God, and keeps from the &s;pots of the world; and to bring them out of all the world's churches and &s;ellow&s;hips, made and &s;et up &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, to the church that is in God, the Fa|ther of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, The&s;&s;. i. 1. and to bring to the unity and fellow&s;hip in the Holy Spirit, that doth mortify, circumci&s;e, and baptize, to plunge down &s;in and corruption, that has got up in man and woman by tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. In this Holy Spirit there is holy fellow&s;hip and unity; yea, it is the bond of the Prince of Princes, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords peace: which hea|venly peace all true Chri&s;tians are to maintain with &s;piri|tual weapons, not with carnal.</P>
<P>And now, my friend, the boly men of God wrote the &s;criptures as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t; and all Chri&s;tendom are on heaps about tho&s;e &s;criptures, be|cau&s;e they are not led by the &s;ame Holy Gho&s;t as tho&s;e were that gave forth the &s;criptures; which Holy Gho&s;t they mu&s;t come to in them&s;elves, and be led by, if they come into all the truth of them, and to have the comfort of God, Chri&s;t, and them. For none can call Je&s;us Lord but by the Holy Gho&s;t; and all that call Chri&s;t Lord without the Holy Gho&s;t, take his name in vain. Like|wi&s;e all that name his name are to depart from iniquity; then they name his name with reverence, in truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. O therefore feel the grace and truth in thy heart, that is come by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that will teach thee how to live, and what to deny. It will e&s;tabli&s;h thy heart, &s;ea&s;on thy words, and bring thy &s;alvation, and will be a
<PB N="231" REF="037441_0747_100D9331F8B6EBC0">teacher unto thee at all times. By it thou maye&s;t receive Chri&s;t, from whence it comes; and as many as receive him, to them he gives power not only to &s;tand again&s;t &s;in and evil, but to become the &s;ons of God: if &s;ons, then heirs of a life, and a world and kingdom without end, and of the eternal riches and trea&s;ures thereof. So in ha&s;te, with my love in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who ta&s;ted death for every man, and brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head, that has been betwixt God and man, that through Chri&s;t man may come to God again, and prai&s;e him through Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Amen, the &s;piritual, heavenly rock and foundation for all God's people to build upon, to the prai&s;e and glory of God, who is over all, ble&s;&s;ed for evermore!</P>

We went to a friend's who&s;e name was Willem Willems, where I had a meeting that night. I had another next day, which was larger: &s;everal profe&s;&s;ors came, and all was quiet and well. After the meeting I vi&s;ited &s;ome friends; then, taking boat, pa&s;&s;ed to Hoorn, counted the chief city in North Holland. We lodged at an inn; and, taking wag|gon
<PB N="232" REF="037441_0748_100D933412CB0130">early next morning, we pa&s;&s;ed to Enckhuy&s;en, where we took &s;hip for Frie&s;land; and, landing in the afternoon at Workum, took water, and rode upon the high bank of the Friezen &s;eas, till we met two friends coming with a wag|gon to meet us, with whom we went to Harlingen, the chief &s;ea-port town in Frie&s;land. We went to He&s;&s;el Jacobs's, whither &s;everal friends came to vi&s;it us that night. Next day we vi&s;ited the friends of the place; and I wrote a paper, directed. <Q>To all them that per&s;ecute friends for not ob|&s;erving their fa&s;t-day.</Q></P>
<P>The day following being fir&s;t-day, friends had a meeting there, to which we went, and many profe&s;&s;ors came to it. I declared the everla&s;ting go&s;pel among&s;t them, John Claus interpreting. They were all very civil, and heard attentive|ly; and when the meeting was done, departed peaceably, without making any oppo&s;ition. After meeting I went to He&s;&s;el Jacobs's again, whither after awhile came a Calvin|i&s;t, to a&s;k me &s;ome que&s;tions, which I an&s;wered to his &s;ati&s;|faction; and he departed friendly. Soon after he was gone, a preacher of the Collegians came to di&s;cour&s;e with me, who &s;eemed well &s;atisfied al&s;o, and we parted lovingly. That evening I had another meeting with the friends there, and next morning we pa&s;&s;ed to Leuwarden, the chief city in Frie&s;land, and lodged that night at a friend's hou&s;e who&s;e name was Sybrand Dowes.</P>
<P>Next morning early we pa&s;&s;ed to Dockum, and, walking through the city, took boat again to Strobus, which is the utmo&s;t part of Frie&s;land. There we baited at a commi&s;&s;a|ry's. Then taking boat, we pa&s;&s;ed to Groningen, the chief city of the province of Groningland. One of the magi&s;|trates of that city came with us from Leuwarden, with whom I had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e on the way; and he was very loving. We walked near three miles through the city; then took boat for Delfziel; and pa&s;&s;ing, in the evening, through Ap|pingdalem, where had been a great hor&s;e-fair that day, there came many officers ru&s;hing into the boat, who, being in drink, were very rude. I exhorted them to <Q>fear the Lord, and beware of Solomon's vanities.</Q> They were a &s;ort of boi&s;terous fellows; yet &s;omewhat more civil afterwards. We landed at Delfziel about the tenth hour at night, having travelled much about fifty Engli&s;h miles that day. We went to an inn to lodge; and as we pa&s;&s;ed through the guards, they examined John Claus, whether I was not a
<PB N="233" REF="037441_0749_100D9335D0FC7708">militia &s;oldier? He told them I was not, and they let us pa&s;s peaceably.</P>
<P>Delfziel &s;tands on the river Eems, over which we pa&s;&s;ed next day to Embden, where friends had been cruelly per|fecuted, and from which they had been often bani&s;hed. I went to an inn, where I dined with &s;ome men that under|&s;tood Engli&s;h, with whom I had a fine time, and they were loving. Meanwhile John Claus went with his wife to her father's, in Embden; whither, after I had dined, I went al&s;o, under&s;tanding the old man was de&s;irous to &s;ee me. In the afternoon John Claus and I walked through the city, to the place where the waggon was to meet us: and while we tarried for it, the friends that were in the city came to the hou&s;e where we were, and we had a little meeting. When the meeting was over, and the waggon came not, we &s;ent to know the rea&s;on. The ma&s;ter of the waggon &s;ent us word, he dur&s;t not let his waggon go; for the bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter's &s;oldiers were up in the country, and he was afraid they would take away his hor&s;es. Being di&s;appointed of our pa&s;&s;age, we returned to John Claus's father-in-law's hou&s;e, where I left him, and went to my inn at night.</P>
<P>We took &s;hipping next day, and pa&s;&s;ed about fifteen miles upon the river Eems, to a market-town in Ea&s;t Frie&s;|land, called Leer, where lived a friend that had been bani&s;h|ed from Embden. When we had vi&s;ited him, we hired a waggon, and pa&s;&s;ed to a garri&s;on-town called Strikehuy&s;en, where the guards examined us; and then we went to Deter|en, where hiring another waggon, we pa&s;&s;ed to another gar|ri&s;on town, where we were very &s;trictly examined. From thence we pa&s;&s;ed to Apre, in the king of Denmark's coun|try, where we lodged that night. In our travelling this day, we met the earl of Oldenburgh, going to the treaty of peace at Lembachie.</P>
<P>Next day we pa&s;&s;ed to Oldenburgh, lately a great and fa|mous place, but then burnt down, and but few hou&s;es left &s;tanding in it. At this place we hired another waggon, and went to Delmenhur&s;t, where, after we had been examined by the guards, we went to a burgoma&s;ter's to lodge, who&s;e hou&s;e was at an inn. There being many people, I decla|red the way of truth to him and them, warning them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all evil-doers.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed next day to Bremen, a &s;tately city in Germa|ny; and from thence, after a double examination, we went to a water called Overdeland, and there took boat to Fi&s;her|holder;
<PB N="234" REF="037441_0750_100D933880E80E40">where finding pretty many people together, I de|clared the way of God to them, and exhorted them <Q>to fear the Lord.</Q> There we took waggon again, and travelled in the bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter's country, to Clo&s;ter-Seven. Hav|ing no inclination to &s;tay there, we got fre&s;h hor&s;es, intend|ing to travel all night. Accordingly we went a little way; but it quickly grew &s;o dark, and rained &s;o hard, that we thought be&s;t to turn back again; for our waggon being open, we had no defence again&s;t the rain, and our cloaths were already wet with the rain that had fallen for &s;everal days before. So we went to an inn, and got a little fre&s;h &s;traw; upon which we lay till about break of day, then &s;et out and travelled to the city of Buxtehude.</P>
<P>The people in the bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter's country were very dark. As we pa&s;&s;ed among&s;t them, I preached truth to them, warning them of the great and notable day of the Lord, exhorting them to &s;oberne&s;s, and to mind the good Spirit of God in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It was on a fir&s;t-day that we went through Buxtehude; and without the walls was a great fair of &s;heep and gee&s;e that day. We &s;taid a little to refre&s;h our&s;elves, and went on as fa&s;t as we could to Hamburgh, partly by waggon, and partly by water.</P>
<P>We got to Hamburgh time enough to have a meeting there that evening. A good and glorious meeting it was. There were, among&s;t others, a bapti&s;t teacher and his wife, and a great man of Sweden with his wife; and all was quiet, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who&s;e power was exalted over all! Yet a hard, dark place this is, and the people are much &s;hut up from truth.</P>
<P>At Hamburgh was a woman that had &s;poken again&s;t me in John Perrot's time, though &s;he had never &s;een me till now. She had been troubled for it ever &s;ince, and now was glad of an opportunity to acknowledge her &s;ault; which &s;he very readily did, and I as readily and freely for|gave her.</P>
<P>We &s;taid that night at Hamburgh, encouraging and &s;trengthening the friends there in their te&s;timony to the truth; and betimes next morning we &s;et forwards towards Frederick&s;tadt, which is two long days journey from Ham|burgh. We went the fir&s;t-day to Elm&s;hoorn, where we baited, and then rode through a garri&s;on-town of the king of Denmark's; and, pa&s;&s;ing by the monument of the earl of Rantzow, came to the city of Itzeho, where we lodged that
<PB N="235" REF="037441_0751_100D933B55C49DD8">night. I had &s;ome &s;ervice in the evening, among the people in the inn, whom I exhorted to &s;oberne&s;s, and to live in the fear of the Lord. Next morning we travelled to Hoghenhorn, where we dined at an inn with one of the coun|cil of Frederick&s;tadt; to whom, and to the re&s;t of the peo|ple pre&s;ent, I declared the truth, with which they &s;eemed to be affected. Then travelling on, we came to a river cal|led Eyder, where we took boat and went to Frederick&s;tadt. We went to William Paul's, where &s;everal friends came to us, for there is a pretty company of friends in that city. We had a fine refre&s;hing meeting together that evening, which made us forget our wearine&s;s; for we were indeed very weary, having travelled hard tho&s;e two days, and were wet through our cloaths, having had much rain in our open waggons. But the Lord made all ea&s;y and good to us; and we were well and glad to &s;ee friends; ble&s;&s;ed be his holy name for ever!</P>
<P>This city is in the duke of Hol&s;tein's country, who would have bani&s;hed friends out of the city and country, and &s;ent to the magi&s;trates of the city to do it; but they &s;aid, they would lay down their offices rather than do it; ina&s;much as them&s;elves came to that city to enjoy the liberty of their con&s;ciences. Friends &s;till enjoy their liberty there, and truth and they are of good report among&s;t the people, both in city and country.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t-day I had a meeting here, to which many people came, and &s;ome rough &s;pirits; but the power of the Lord bound them down, and the Seed of life was &s;et over all. While I was here, I had a di&s;cour&s;e with a Levite concern|ing the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah; and he was much confound|ed in what he &s;aid; yet he carried him&s;elf lovingly, and in|vited me to his hou&s;e. I went, and there di&s;cour&s;ed with a Jew, who &s;hewed me their Talmud, and many other Jew|i&s;h books: but they are very dark, and do not under&s;tand their own prophets.</P>
<P>There was at this city a Bapti&s;t teacher, who had reproach|ed and belied friends; wherefore John Claus went, with two friends of the town, to the hou&s;e where he lodged, cleared truth and friends from his reproaches, and laid his lies and &s;landers upon his own head, to his &s;hame.</P>
<P>Before we left this place, I had another meeting with friends only, wherein I laid before them the u&s;efulne&s;s of a monthly meeting, for looking after the poor, and taking care that marriages, and all other things relating to the
<PB N="236" REF="037441_0752_100D933CE650BF10">church, were performed in an orderly manner. The thing an&s;wered the witne&s;s of God in their con&s;ciences, &s;o they readily agreed to have monthly meetings thenceforward among&s;t them&s;elves, that both men and women might take care of the outward concerns of the church.</P>
<P>Feeling my &s;pirit clear of that place, we took leave of friends, whom we left in good order, and turned back for Hamburgh. When we had travelled one day's journey, and came to an inn at night to lodge, I enquired whether there were any tender people in the town that feared God, or that had a mind to di&s;cour&s;e of the things of God? The inn-keeper told me, there were few &s;uch in that town. Next night we got to Hamburgh, and having pa&s;&s;ed the guards, went to a friend's hou&s;e, being very weary; for we had been up tho&s;e two mornings before the third hour, and had travelled each day hard and late. Here we met with John Hill, an Engli&s;h friend, who had been travelling in Germany; and being in a &s;hip bound for Am&s;terdam that waited for a wind, he had lain &s;ick on board about two weeks; and now hearing that I was in the country got off from the &s;hip, and came hither to meet me, and go along with me.</P>
<P>We had a very good meeting here, and very peaceable. After which I had di&s;cour&s;e with a Swede, an eminent man in his own country; who having been bani&s;hed from thence upon the account of his religion, was come to Hamburgh, and was at the meeting I had there before. When I had done with him, I had another di&s;cour&s;e with a Bapti&s;t con|cerning the &s;acraments, &s;o called: in both which I had good &s;ervice, having opportunity thereby to open truth un|to them.</P>
<P>Being clear of Hamburgh, we took leave of friends there, whom we left well; and taking John Hill with us, pa&s;&s;ed by boat to a city in the duke of Lunenburgh's country; where, after we were examined by the guards, we were had to the main guard, and there examined more &s;trictly; but after they found we were not &s;oldiers, they were civil to us, and let us pa&s;s. In the afternoon we travelled by waggon, and the waters being much out, by rea&s;on of the great rains that had fallen, when it drew towards night we hired a boy to guide us through a great water. When we came to it the water was &s;o deep, before we could come at the bridge, that the waggoner was &s;ain to wade, and I drove the wag|gon. When we were come upon the bridge, the hor&s;es broke part of it down, and one of them fell into the water,
<PB N="237" REF="037441_0753_100D933F18C602B0">the waggon &s;tanding upon that part of the bridge which remained unbroken. It was the Lord's mercy to us, that the waggon did not run into the brook. When they had got the hor&s;e out, he lay awhile as if he had been dead; but at length they got him up, put him to the waggon again, laid the planks right, and then, through the goodne&s;s of the Lord to us, we got &s;afe over.</P>
<P>After this we came to another water, which finding to be very deep, and it being in the night, we hired two men to help us through. The&s;e men put cords to the waggon to hold it by, that the force of the water might not drive it be&s;ide the way. But when we came into it, the &s;tream was &s;o &s;trong it took one of the hor&s;es off his legs, and was car|rying him down the &s;tream; which I &s;eeing, called to the waggoner to pluck him to him by his reins, which he did, and the hor&s;e recovered his legs, and with much difficulty we got over the bridge, and went to Bormer-haven, the town where the waggoner lived. It was the la&s;t day of the &s;ixth month that we e&s;caped the&s;e dangers, and being about the eleventh hour in the night when we came in here, we got &s;ome fre&s;h &s;traw, and lay upon it till about four in the morning. Then getting up, we &s;et forward again towards Bremen, going part of the way by waggon, and part by boat. In the way I had good opportunities to publi&s;h truth, e&s;pecially at a market-town where we &s;taid to change our pa&s;&s;age; where I declared the truth to the people, warning them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon all fle&s;h; and exhorting them to righteou&s;ne&s;s, telling them, 'that God was come to teach his people him&s;elf,' and that they &s;hould turn to the Lord, and hearken to the teachings of his Spirit in their own hearts.</P>
<P>At Bremen we were examined, and after went to an inn, and &s;taid till another waggon was provided to carry us fur|ther. Though I felt the Lord's power was over the city, and kept the wicked and unruly &s;pirits down, yet my &s;pirit &s;uffered much in this place for the people's &s;ake. When our waggon was ready we left Bremen, and travelled to Ke|by, where we lodged at an inn, and early next morning &s;et out for Oldenburgh. It was a lamentable &s;ight to &s;ee &s;o great and brave a city burnt down. We went to an inn, and though it was fir&s;t-day the &s;oldiers were drinking, and playing at &s;hovel-board, and at tho&s;e few hou&s;es that were left, the &s;hops were open, and the people trading one with another. I was moved to declare the truth among them,
<PB N="238" REF="037441_0754_100D9340AF2EC028">and warn them of the judgments of God; and though they heard me quietly, and were civil towards me, yet I was bur|thened with their wickedne&s;s. Many times in mornings, and at noons and nights, at the inns, and on the ways, as I travelled, I &s;poke to the people, preaching the truth to them, warning them of the day of the Lord, and exhorting them to turn to the light and Spirit of God in them&s;elves, that thereby they might be led out of evil.</P>
<P>Next day, pa&s;&s;ing through many great waters, we came to Leer, and the day following to Embden, where John Claus's wife's father lived; at who&s;e hou&s;e, when we went into Germany, we left a young man &s;ick, who travel|led with me, and u&s;ed to write for me; whom now we found pretty well recovered. John Claus went to his father-in|law's, John Hill and I to an inn, where we dined. After dinner we went al&s;o to John Claus's father's, and had a good meeting there in the evening.</P>
<P>The day following we took &s;hipping at Embden, and pa&s;&s;ed to Delfziel, and went to an inn, where a friend came to us that then lived in Delfziel, having been often bani&s;hed from Embden: he was a gold&s;mith by trade, and had a hou&s;e and &s;hop in Embden, and &s;till as they bani&s;hed him he went again. Then they impri&s;oned him, fed him with bread and water, and at length took his goods from him, and bani&s;hed him, his wife and children, leaving them nei|ther place to come to, nor any thing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on. We comforted and encouraged him in the Lord, exhorting him to be faithful, and &s;tand &s;teadfa&s;t in the te&s;timony committed to him. When we had taken leave of him, we pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame day to Groningen, where we met with Cornelius An|dries, a friend, that had al&s;o &s;uffered much by impri&s;on|ment and bani&s;hment at Embden. We went with him to his hou&s;e, and the next day we had a good meeting in that city, to which &s;everal profe&s;&s;ors came, who were very peace|able and attentive. After meeting we pa&s;&s;ed by boat to Stro|bus, and Dockum, where we lodged that night at an inn. Taking boat again next morning, we pa&s;&s;ed to Leuwarden, the chief city of Frien&s;tand, where I found my daughter Yeomans, who was come from Am&s;terdam thither to meet me. That day we had a precious meeting at Sybrand Dowes's hou&s;e. After the meeting I had di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome that were at the meeting, who had been formerly con|vinced of truth; but were not come into obedience to it.
<PB N="239" REF="037441_0755_100D9343D3365D90">We &s;taid there that night; but John Hill left us, and went that day to Harlingen, and &s;o to Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>Next day we pa&s;&s;ed down the river to the lake of Hem|pen-Sarmer, and thence by the lake Lugmer, and &s;o to a town called Anderigo; from whence &s;ailing through the lake Whi&s;pool, we came to Gardick within night. We lodged at an inn; and the next day, being fir&s;t-day, we were at friends meeting there, which was very large, many of the town's-people coming in. I declared the truth in the power of the Lord, that was upon me; which tendered the people, and they were very &s;ober. After the meeting we &s;taid to refre&s;h our&s;elves, and went to take boat again; but the people ob&s;erving us, gathered together at a bridge we were to pa&s;s, and there I declared the way of life and &s;alva|tion unto them, and they were very attentive and civil.</P>
<P>We went back that evening to Leuwarden, being twenty|&s;even miles; but before we could reach it, the gates were &s;hut and the bridges drawn up, &s;o that we could not get into the city, but were fain to lie in the boat all night; and a man being killed in the city that night, it was late before the gates were opened. When we could get in, we went to a friend's hou&s;e, where we &s;taid awhile; then taking boat, we pa&s;&s;ed through Franeker to Harlingen, to Ha&s;&s;el Jacobs's, where we found &s;everal Dutch friends come to be at the meeting there next day. William Penn, returning two or three days before out of Germany, had been at a large meeting at Am&s;terdam on fir&s;t-day; and after meet|ing, under&s;tanding I was at Harlingen, came thither to me.</P>
<P>Next day was the monthly meeting for men and women, to which we went. It was large and good. And there it was agreed, <Q>a meeting &s;hould be held there once a month, both for the men and for the women, to take care of the outward concerns of the church.</Q></P>
<P>In the afternoon we had a publick meeting, to which came people of &s;everal &s;orts. Socinians, Bapti&s;ts, Luther|ans, &amp;c. among&s;t whom was a doctor of phy&s;ich and a prie&s;t. After I had declared the truth pretty largely open|ing the happy &s;tate that man and woman were in whil&s;t they kept under God's teaching, and abode in paradi&s;e; and the wo and mi&s;ery that came upon them when they went from God's teaching, hearkened to the &s;erpent's, tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed God's command, and were driven out of the para|di&s;e of God; and &s;et forth the way whereby man and wo|man might come into that happy &s;tate again: the prie&s;t, an
<PB N="240" REF="037441_0756_100D93456289DF88">ancient grave man, &s;tood up ju&s;t as I had done &s;peaking, and, putting off his hat, &s;aid, <Q>I pray God to pro&s;per and con&s;irm that doctrine, for it is truth, and I have nothing 'again&s;t it.</Q> He would willingly have &s;taid till the meeting had been ended, but being to preach that evening, he could not &s;tay longer, the time for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">own wor&s;hip being come. Wherefore, when he had made confe&s;&s;ion of the truth, he ha&s;tened away, that he might come again; and did come, it &s;eems, to the meeting-place, but the meeting was ended fir&s;t. After which we went to Ha&s;&s;el Jacobs's, where I had a meeting with friends, and the doctor of phy|&s;ick came thither to di&s;cour&s;e with William Penn, who had a good opportunity to open truth to him. By this doctor the prie&s;t &s;ent his love to me, wi&s;hing him to tell me, that he had left preaching that evening half an hour &s;ooner than he u&s;ed to do, that he might come to our meeting again to hear more of that good doctrine. I heard afterwards, that his hearers que&s;tioned him for what he had &s;aid in our meet|ing; and that, he &s;tanding by his words, they had com|plained of him for it to the other prie&s;ts of the city, who called him to account about it; but the re&s;ult I could not learn.</P>
<P>Early next morning William Penn, taking John Claus with him, pa&s;&s;ed from Harlingen for Leuwarden, where he had appointed a meeting, intending to travel into &s;ome other parts of Germany to vi&s;it a tender people there. I, with tho&s;e friends that were with me, took &s;hip the &s;ame day for Am&s;terdam, where we arrived a little after mid|night; but the gates being &s;hut, we lay on board till morn|ing: then went to Gertrude Dirick Nie&s;on's, where many friends came to &s;ee us, being glad of our &s;afe return. Next day, &s;eeling a concern upon my mind, with relation to tho&s;e &s;educing &s;pirits that made divi&s;ion among friends, and being &s;en&s;ible that they endeavoured to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the affectionate part, I was moved to write a few lines to friends concerning them, as followeth:</P>

<P>The fir&s;t-day following, I was at friends meeting at Am|&s;terdam, to which many people came, and were very civil and attentive, hearing truth declared &s;everal hours. John Roeloffs interpreted for me.</P>
<P>Before this &s;everal of the friends that came over with me were returned to England again, as Robert Barclay, George Keith's wife, and others; and now my daughter Yeomans went back al&s;o: &s;o that I was left alone at Am&s;terdam.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO whom is my love in the Lord's truth, that is over all, and by which all God's people are made free men and women, being thereby &s;et free from him who is out of the truth; that walking in the truth, they may an&s;wer the witne&s;s of God in all people: which truth all mu&s;t come to, if they be made free. Therefore be &s;aithful unto what the Lord manife&s;ts unto you. I am glad the Lord hath witne&s;&s;es in that city, to &s;tand for his glory and name, and for Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the great prophet, whom God hath rai&s;ed up, who is to be heard in all things; &s;o that ye need none of the prophets which men have rai&s;ed up. Therefore &s;tand faithful to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, your Shepherd, that he may &s;eed you; hear his voice, and follow him, who has laid down his life for you; but follow none of the &s;hepherds and hirelings that are made by men, though they may be angry becau&s;e ye will not follow them to their dry and bar|ren mountains, who have been and are the thieves, per&s;e|cutors, and robbers, that climb up another way than by Chri&s;t. Set up Chri&s;t to be your coun&s;ellor and leader, and then ye will have no need of any of the coun&s;ellors and leaders of the world; for Chri&s;t is &s;ufficient, whom
<PB N="242" REF="037441_0758_100D934AABF069C0">God has given you. Set up Chri&s;t Je&s;us to be your bi&s;hop and over&s;eer, who is &s;ufficient to over&s;ee you, that you go not a&s;tray from God; by which ye may &s;ee over all the hireling-over&s;eers made by men, which keep the people, that they do not go from the rudiments, forma|lities, fa&s;hions, and cu&s;toms of the world, which hath been and is their work. I am glad that ye are come to own Chri&s;t Je&s;us, your high prie&s;t, who is holy, harmle&s;s, &s;epa|rate from &s;inners, and made higher than the heavens, as the church and the apo&s;tle did own him in their days, Heb. vii. who is the high prie&s;t over the hou&s;ehold of faith; which faith Chri&s;t Je&s;us is the author and &s;ini&s;her of: and this do all the children of the new covenant witne&s;s, who walk in the new and living way. Therefore my di&s;ire is, that ye all may be &s;teadfa&s;t, whether in bonds or out, in the faith of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which is the gift of God; by which faith the valiants overcame the devil and all their enemies; in which faith they had victory and acce&s;s to God, and in that was their unity; which my&s;tery of faith is held in a pure con&s;cience, hidden from the world. I do believe, that your impri&s;onments and &s;ufferings in that place will be for good in the end (as it hath been in other places) ye &s;tanding faithful to the Lord, who is all-&s;uffici|ent. For your &s;ufferings and trials will try their teachers and religions, churches and wor&s;hips, and make manife&s;t what birth they are of; even that which per&s;ecutes him that is born of the Spirit: for ye know that there is no &s;al|vation by any other name under the whole heaven, but by the name of Je&s;us; therefore it is time to leave them, when there is no &s;alvation by or in any of them. Now, friends, I de&s;ire that you would take a li&s;t of the names of all tho&s;e that belong to the king of Poland, where they live, and how ye may &s;end books and epi&s;tles to them, and keep a corre&s;pondence with them; al&s;o the name of the bi&s;hop or cardinal that I heard was with you; and if ye can get any that belong to the king to come to vi&s;it the pri&s;oners, that they may inform the king of their cruel &s;ufferings. Al&s;o I de&s;ire you to get as many books of mine as you can di&s;|po&s;e of, that &s;et forth your &s;ufferings, and the cruelty of the magi&s;trates of Dantzick; and give them to the king, his council, attendants, and bi&s;hops. And &s;ome of the women may &s;peak to the queen, if they can, that &s;he may &s;ignify to the king their cruel &s;ufferings; and e&s;pecially &s;ome of the &s;ufferers wives, if there be any of capacity to
<PB N="243" REF="037441_0759_100D934CB4726FF8">do it. You may likewi&s;e give his attendants any other friends books; what books ye lack, &s;end for to Am&s;terdam, where ye may be furni&s;hed with them, to an&s;wer every ten|der de&s;irer, and inquiring mind after the Lord. So let all your minds be bended with the Lord's power, to &s;pread his truth abroad; and where ye hear of any, or have any corre&s;pondence in trading with any &s;ober people, far or near, &s;end them books, that their under&s;tandings may be opened after the Lord. The Lord God Almighty pre|&s;erve you! To his protection, in his eternal power, do I commend you all, in bonds or at liberty, with my love to you in the everla&s;ting &s;eed of God Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who brui&s;es the head of the &s;erpent, that makes you to &s;uffer. Chri&s;t is over him, and will be when he is gone, who is Fir&s;t and La&s;t, over all, from everla&s;ting to ever|la&s;ting, in whom ye have life, knowledge, wi&s;dom, and &s;alvation, and through him live to the prai&s;e and glory of God, who is ble&s;&s;ed for evermore, Amen.</P>

<P>The next day, the fourth of the week and the nineteenth of the month, I had a large meeting at Am&s;terdam, many profe&s;&s;ors being at it, and truth was largely opened to them, in the demon&s;tration of the heavenly power. The day following I went by boat, many friends going with me, to Land&s;meer in Waterland (a town in which, they &s;ay, there are above an hundred bridges) where I had a very good meeting, to which &s;everal profe&s;&s;ors came. After the meet|ing I returned with friends to Am&s;terdam again, where I &s;taid till the fir&s;t-day following, and went to their meeting which was large. Many profe&s;&s;ors of &s;everal &s;orts were at it, and heard the truth declared with great attention.</P>
<P>I tarried next day, and the night following had a great exerci&s;e upon my &s;pirit concerning that loo&s;e &s;pirit that was run into &s;trife and contention among friends, and had drawn &s;ome after it into divi&s;ion and &s;eparation; the way, work, and end whereof the Lord opened to me; wherefore, feeling the motion of life upon me, I got up in the morning and wrote the following epi&s;tle to friends.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>KEEP your fir&s;t love in the truth, power, and &s;eed of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; for this la&s;t night, as I was ly|ing in my bed at Am&s;terdam, I had a great travail in the holy &s;eed of life and peace, and my &s;pirit was troubled with that &s;pirit of &s;trife and &s;eparation. I &s;aw it was a de&s;troy|ing &s;pirit, and did &s;eek not only to get over the &s;eed, but to de&s;troy it, and to eat out the minds of the people from it by &s;trife and contention; and under pretence of &s;tand|ing for the ancient truth, its work is to root it out and de&s;|troy the appearance of it, to &s;et up it&s;elf. It is a creeping &s;pirit, &s;eeking whom it can get into; and what it cannot do it&s;elf it &s;tirreth up others to do, and &s;etteth their &s;pirits on float, with the dark wi&s;dom to de&s;troy the &s;imple. This &s;pirit is managed by the prince of the air, and lead|eth &s;ome to do things they would have been a&s;hamed to have done, as men, which doth unman them; and they would not have &s;uffered them, if they had kept to the tender principle of God, which leadeth to peace. It is a de&s;pi&s;ing, backbiting, &s;ecret-whi&s;pering &s;pirit, a &s;ower of di&s;&s;en&s;ion, and a taker of advantage of all prejudiced &s;pi|rits that are di&s;obedient to their fir&s;t principle and love and truth, and begetteth into hatred; &s;o it begetteth all into that &s;pirit, who&s;e work is to de&s;troy both the good within and the good order without. Nay, it would, if it could, de&s;troy the government of Chri&s;t and the order of the go&s;|pel, to &s;et up its own will and &s;pirit, which is not of God, and, under pretence of crying down man, is &s;etting up man, and gathering into a &s;eparation of di&s;obedient men, who float above their conditions. This &s;pirit, which nei|ther liveth in the truth nor its order, but oppo&s;eth them that do. I cannot expre&s;s it as I &s;ec it and its work, who&s;e end will be accordingly. Therefore, friends, I am to warn you all that have not lo&s;t your &s;implicity, not to touch it, nor to have any unity with it, le&s;t you be defil|ed, lo&s;e your conditions of your eternal e&s;tate, and your everla&s;ting portion; and that your inward man, which is after God, may be pre&s;erved, and Chri&s;t may reign in all your hearts. And they that are joined with them, it will be very hard for them ever to come down to truth in them|&s;elves, and to &s;ee their own conditions, and to have that &s;pirit of &s;trife and contention (which eateth as a canker) brought down in them: which is carnal, and &s;layeth the tender babe, which was once begotten in them&s;elves. The
<PB N="245" REF="037441_0761_100D934FE46640A8">Phili&s;tine is got up in them, that &s;toppeth the wells and &s;prings, maketh a great bu&s;tle, and is crying up men, and pleading for them in&s;tead of Chri&s;t. So, friends, &s;trive not with them, but let tho&s;e take them that cry them up. Keep you to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t with his light, that cometh from him, that he may be your Lord, and ye in him may be all in unity, in one light, life, power, and dominion in Chri&s;t, your head. The God of Peace and Power pre&s;erve you all in Chri&s;t Je&s;us your Saviour, and out of and from that mi&s;chievous &s;pirit which is idle and &s;lothful, as to the work of the Power, Spirit, and Light of God and Chri&s;t. Its very act worketh &s;trife and di&s;|turbance again&s;t the peace of the church of Chri&s;t. It thinks in its wilfulne&s;s, &s;tubbornne&s;s, and unruline&s;s to &s;et up it&s;elf, and in that to have peace; but de&s;truction will be the end of it: and it is &s;ealed for the fire and eternal judgment. Therefore let Chri&s;t the Seed be the head and crown of every one of you, that nothing may be be|tween you and the Lord God. Be not deceived with vain, feigned, or rough words: for Satan is transforming him|&s;elf as an Angel of Light to deceive, but God's founda|tion &s;tandeth &s;ure, and God knoweth who are his, and will pre&s;erve his upon the rock and foundation of life, in his peaceable truth and habitation, that in the &s;ame they may grow. Keep out of &s;trife and contention with it, after ye have borne your te&s;timony in the Lord's power and truth again&s;t it, then keep in the truth; for it hath a life in &s;cribbling, &s;trife, and jangling, becau&s;e it would en|large its hell, and bring others into its mi&s;ery with the airy power, and would get power over the good, and di&s;|join people from it, and &s;o commit rapes upon the &s;impli|city by its &s;ubtilty. But I do believe the Lord will de|fend his people, though he may try them and exerci&s;e them with this &s;pirit for a time, as he hath done it days pa&s;t, in other ve&s;&s;els it hath made u&s;e of as it doth of the&s;e now, who have a more &s;eeming fair out&s;ide, but foul, rough, and rugged enough within, again&s;t the Seed Chri&s;t, as ever were the Phari&s;ees to de&s;troy it. They, under a pretence of preaching Chri&s;t, are de&s;troyers and crucifiers of him, and killers of the ju&s;t, not only in them&s;elves, but are endeavouring with all their might to de&s;troy it in others where it is born. Pharaoh and Herod &s;lay the young Jews in the &s;pirit as the old did: I &s;eel it worrying of them. That is got up to be king, which knew not &s;uf|fering
<PB N="246" REF="037441_0762_100D9352A432B558">Jo&s;eph. But God will plague him, and the Seed will have more re&s;t, and be better entertained in Egypt than under Herod, into whom old Pharaoh's &s;pirit is en|tered. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear, and an eye to &s;ee, let him &s;ee how this &s;pirit hath transformed in all ages again&s;t the ju&s;t and righteous; but mark what hath been its end. The Seed reigneth; glory to the Lord God over all for ever! His truth &s;preadeth, and friends here are in unity and peace, and of good report, an&s;wering the good or that of God in people. My de&s;ires are, that all God's people may do the &s;ame in all places, that the Lord may be glorified in their bringing forth much fruit that is heavenly and &s;piritual. Amen.</P>

<P>After I had given forth the foregoing epi&s;tle, whereby my &s;pirit was in &s;ome mea&s;ure ea&s;ed of the weight that lay upon it, I went in the afternoon to the monthly meeting of friends at Am&s;terdam; where the Lord was pre&s;ent with us, and re|fre&s;hed our &s;pirits together in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I thought to have gone next day to Harlem: but there being a fa&s;t appointed to be kept that day, I was &s;topped in my &s;pirit, and moved to &s;tay at friends meeting at Am&s;ter|dam. We had a very large meeting, a great concour&s;e of people coming to it, and among&s;t them many great per&s;ons. The Lord's power was over the meeting, in the openings whereof I was moved to declare to the people, <Q>That no man by all his wit and &s;tudy, nor by reading hi&s;tory in his own will, could declare or know the generation of Chri&s;t, who was not begotten by the will of man, but by the will of God. After I had largely opened this, I &s;hewed them the difference between the true fa&s;t and the fal&s;e, ma|nife&s;ting that the profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, Jews, and Turks, were out of the true fa&s;t, and fa&s;ted for &s;trife and debate, being under the band and fi&s;ts of iniquity and oppre&s;&s;ion, wherewith they were &s;miting one another; but the pure hands were not lifted up to God. And though they did all appear to men to fa&s;t, and did hang down their heads for a day like a bulru&s;h, yet that was not the fa&s;t which God did accept; but in that &s;tate all their bones were dry, and when they called upon the Lord he did not an&s;wer them, neither did their health grow; for they kept their
<PB N="247" REF="037441_0763_100D9354DC3B3FC8">own fa&s;t, and not the Lord's. I exhorted them to keep the Lord's fa&s;t, which was to fa&s;t from &s;in and iniquity, &s;trife and debate, violence and oppre&s;&s;ion, and to ab&s;tain from every appearance of evil.</Q> The&s;e things were open|ed to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the fa&s;ters, and the meeting ended peaceably and well.</P>
<P>I went to Harlem the day following, having before ap|pointed a meeting. Peter Hendricks and Gertrude Dirick Nie&s;on went with me, and a ble&s;&s;ed meeting we had. There were profe&s;&s;ors of &s;everal &s;orts, and a prie&s;t of the Lutherans, who &s;at very attentive for &s;everal hours while I declared the truth. Gertrude interpreting. When the meeting was done, the prie&s;t &s;aid, <Q>He had heard nothing but what was ac|cording to the word of God, and de&s;ired the ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord might re&s;t upon us and our a&s;&s;emblies.</Q> Others al&s;o confe&s;&s;ed to the truth, &s;aying, <Q>They had never heard things &s;o plainly opened to their under&s;tandings before.</Q></P>
<P>We &s;taid that night at Harlem at a friend's hou&s;e, who&s;e name was Dirick Kla&s;&s;en; and returning next day to Am&s;ter|dam, went to Gertrude's hou&s;e; where we had not been long before a prie&s;t of great note, who had formerly belonged to the emperor of Germany, and another German prie&s;t, came, de&s;iring to have &s;ome conference with me. I took the op|portunity to declare the way of truth, opening unto them how they might come to know God and Chri&s;t, and his law and go&s;pel; and &s;hewing them, that they could never know it by &s;tudy, nor philo&s;ophy, but by divine revelation through the Spirit of God, opening to them in the &s;tillne&s;s of their minds. The men were tender, and went away well &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t-day following I was at friends meeting at Am|&s;terdam, where, among&s;t &s;everal &s;orts of profe&s;&s;ors, was a doctor of Poland, who for his religion was bani&s;hed from the place he lived in, and being affected with the te&s;timony of truth in the meeting, he came afterwards to have &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with me: and after we had been &s;ome time to|gether, and I had opened things further to him, he went away very tender and loving.</P>
<P>While I was at Am&s;terdam, I &s;pent much of my time in writing books, papers, or epi&s;tles on truth's behalf. I wrote &s;everal epi&s;tles from Am&s;terdam to friends in England and el&s;ewhere, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, as the Lord moved me by his Spirit thereunto. I wrote al&s;o from thence, <Q>A warning to the inhabitants of the city of Oldenburgh, which was
<PB N="248" REF="037441_0764_100D9356F784EBD0">lately burned down;</Q> al&s;o, <Q>A warning to the inhabitants of the city of Hamburgh.</Q> I wrote al&s;o an epi&s;tle to the amba&s;&s;adors that were treating about a peace at Nimeguen. To the magi&s;trates and prie&s;ts of Embden I wrote, &s;hewing them their unchri&s;tian practices in per&s;ecuting friends. I wrote &s;everal other books there, in an&s;wer to prie&s;ts and others, of Hamburgh, Dantzick, and other places, to clear the truth and friends from their fal&s;e charges and &s;landers.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time George Keith and William Penn came back from Germany to Am&s;terdam, and had a di&s;pute with one Galenus Abrahams (one of the mo&s;t noted Bapti&s;ts in Holland) at which many profe&s;&s;ors were pre&s;ent; but not having time to fini&s;h the di&s;pute then, they met again two days after, and the Bapti&s;t was much confounded, and truth gained ground. Between the&s;e two di&s;putes we had a very great meeting at friends meeting-place, at which many hun|dreds of people were; &s;ome of high rank in the world's ac|count. An earl, a lord, and divers other eminent per&s;ons were pre&s;ent, who all behaved them&s;elves very civilly. But, when the meeting was ended, &s;ome prie&s;ts began to make oppo&s;ition; which when William Penn under&s;tood, he &s;tood up again, and an&s;wered them to the great &s;atisfac|tion of the people, who were much affected with the &s;everal te&s;timonies they had heard. After the meeting &s;everal of them came to Gertrude's, where we were, with whom George Keith had much di&s;cour&s;e in Latin.</P>
<P>Having now fini&s;hed our &s;ervice at Am&s;terdam, we took leave of friends there, and pa&s;&s;ed by waggon to Leyden, about twenty-five miles; where we &s;taid a day or two, &s;eek|ing out and vi&s;iting &s;ome tender people that we heard of there. We met with a German, who was partly convinced. He informed us of an eminent man that was inquiring after truth. Some &s;ought him out and vi&s;ited him, and found him a &s;erious man. I al&s;o &s;poke to him, and he owned the truth. William Penn and Benjamin Furly went to vi&s;it another great man, that lived a little out of Leyden, who, they &s;aid, had been general to the king of Denmark's forces. He and his wife were very loving to them, and heard the truth with joy.</P>
<P>From Leyden we went to the Hague, where the prince of Orange kept his court; and vi&s;ited one of the judges of Holland, with whom we had much di&s;cour&s;e. He was a wi&s;e tender man, and put many objections and queries to us, which when we had an&s;wered, he was &s;atisfied, and part|ed
<PB N="249" REF="037441_0765_100D93590376DB28">with us in much love. Leaving the Hague, we went to Delft, and from thence that night to Rotterdam, where we &s;taid &s;everal days, and had &s;everal meetings. While I was here, I gave forth a book for the Jews, with whom, when I was at Am&s;terdam, I had a de&s;ire to have had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e; but they would not. Here al&s;o I reviewed &s;eve|ral other books and papers, which I had given forth before, and were now tran&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Finding our &s;pirits clear of the &s;ervice which the Lord had given us to do in Holland, we took leave of friends of Rotterdam, and pa&s;&s;ed by boat to the Briel, in order to take pa&s;&s;age that day in the packet-boat for England, &s;everal friends of Rotterdam accompanying us, and &s;ome of Am|&s;terdam, who were come to &s;ee us again before we left Hol|land. But the packet-boat not coming in till night, we were fain to lodge at the Briel; and next day, the one-and-twentieth of the eighth month, and the fir&s;t-day of the week, we went on board, and &s;et &s;ail about the tenth hour, viz. William Penn, George Keith and I, and Gertrude Dirick Nie&s;on, with her children.</P>
<P>We were in all about &s;ixty pa&s;&s;engers, and had a long and hazardous pa&s;&s;age: for the winds were contrary, and the weather &s;tormy; the boat al&s;o very leaky, in&s;omuch that we were fain to have two pumps continually going day and night, &s;o that it was thought there was twice as much water pumped out as the ve&s;&s;el would have held. But the Lord, who is able to make the &s;tormy winds to cea&s;e and the raging waves of the &s;ea to be calm, yea, to rai&s;e them and &s;top them at his plea&s;ure, he alone did pre&s;erve us; prai&s;ed be his name for ever! Though our pa&s;&s;age was hard, yet we had a fine time, and good &s;ervice for truth on board among the pa&s;&s;engers, &s;ome of whom were great folk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and were very kind and loving. We arrived at Harwich the 23d of the eighth month at night, having been two nights and almo&s;t three days at &s;ea. Next morning William Penn and George Keith took hor&s;e for Colche&s;ter; but I &s;taid, and had a meeting at Harwich; and there being no Col|che&s;ter coach there, and the po&s;t-ma&s;ter's wife being unrea|&s;onable in her demands for a coach, and deceiving us of it al&s;o after we had hired it, we went to a friend's hou&s;e about a mile and an half in the country, and hired his waggon, which we bedded well with &s;traw, and rode in it to Col|che&s;ter.</P>
<P>I &s;taid in Colche&s;ter till fir&s;t-day, having a de&s;ire to be at
<PB N="250" REF="037441_0766_100D935B97FAB7B8">friends' meeting there that day; and a very large and weighty meeting it was: for friends hearing of my return from Hol|land, flocked from &s;everal parts of the country; and many of the town's people coming al&s;o, it was thought there were about a thou&s;and people at the meeting, and all was peace|able. Having &s;taid a day or two longer at Colche&s;ter, I travelled through E&s;&s;ex, vi&s;iting friends at Hal&s;ted. Brain|tree, Fel&s;ted, and Saling, and having meetings with them. At Chelmsford I had a meeting in the evening. There being many friends pri&s;oners, they got liberty, and came to the meeting, and we were well refre&s;hed together in the Lord. Next day, the 9th of the ninth month, I got to London, where friends received me with great joy; and the fir&s;t-day following went to Gracechurch-&s;treet meeting, where the Lord vi&s;ited us with his refre&s;hing pre&s;ence, and the glory of the Lord &s;urrounded the meeting; prai&s;ed be the Lord!</P>
<P>After I had been a little while in London, I wrote the following letter to my wife:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

I have been twice at Gracechurch-&s;treet meet|ing; and though oppo&s;ite &s;pirits were there, yet all was quiet; the dew of heaven fell upon the people, and the glory of the Lord &s;hined over all. Every day I am fain to be at meetings about bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ufferings, which are great abroad; and now many friends are concerned with many per&s;ons about them: &s;o in ha&s;te, with my love to you all&mdash;</P>

<P>About this time I received letters from New-England, which gave account of the magi&s;trates and rulers cruel and unchri&s;tian proceedings again&s;t friends there, whipping and abu&s;ing them very &s;hamefully; for they whipped many wo|men friends. One woman they tied to a cart, and dragged her along the &s;treet, &s;he being &s;tripped above the wai&s;t.
<PB N="251" REF="037441_0767_100D935D29B23990">Yea, they whipped &s;ome ma&s;ters of &s;hips, that were not friends, only for bringing friends thither. At that very time, while they were per&s;ecuting friends in this barbarous man|ner, the Indians &s;lew three&s;core of their men, took one of their captains, and flayed the &s;kin off his head while he was alive, and carried it away in triumph: &s;o that the &s;ober people &s;aid, <Q>The judgments of God came upon them for per&s;ecuting the Quakers:</Q> but the blind, dark prie&s;ts &s;aid, "It was becau&s;e they did not per&s;ecute them enough." Great exerci&s;e I had in &s;eeking relief here for poor &s;uffer|ing friends there, that they might not lie under the rod of the wicked.</P>
<P>Upon this and other &s;ervices for truth I &s;taid in London a month or five weeks, vi&s;iting meetings, and helping and encouraging friends to labour for the deliverance of their &s;uffering brethren in other parts. Afterwards I went to King&s;ton, and vi&s;ited friends there and thereaway. Having &s;tard a little among friends there, overlooking a book which I had then ready to go to the pre&s;s, I went into Bucking|ham&s;hire, vi&s;iting friends, and had &s;everal meetings among&s;t them at Amer&s;ham, Hungerhill, Jordans, Hedgerly, Wick|ham, and Turvil-heath. Im &s;ome of which, tho&s;e that were gone out from the unity of friends in truth, into &s;trife, op|po&s;ition, and divi&s;ion, were very unruly and trouble&s;ome; particularly at the men's meeting at Thomas Ellwood's at Hungerhill, where the chief of them came from Wickham, endeavouring to make di&s;turbance, and to hinder friends from proceeding in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the meeting. When I &s;aw their de&s;ign, I admoni&s;hed them to be &s;ober and quiet, and not trouble the meeting, by interrupting the &s;ervice thereof; but rather, if they were di&s;&s;atisfied with friends pro|ceedings, and had any thing to object, let a meeting be ap|pointed on purpo&s;e &s;ome other day. So friends offered to give them a meeting another day; which at length was agreed to be at Thomas Ellwood's the week following. Accordingly friends met them there, and the meeting was in the barn; for there came &s;o many, the hou&s;e could not receive them. After we had &s;at awhile, they began their jangling. Mo&s;t of their arrows were &s;hot at me; but the Lord was with me, and gave me &s;trength in his power to ca&s;t back their darts of envy and fal&s;ehood upon them&s;elves. Their objections were an&s;wered; things were opened to the people; and a good opportunity it was, and &s;erviceable to the truth; many that before were weak, were now &s;trength|ened
<PB N="252" REF="037441_0768_100D935F424F08B0">and confirmed; &s;ome that were doubting and waver|ing were &s;atisfied and &s;ettled; and faithful friends were refre&s;hed and comforted in the &s;pringing of life among&s;t us: for the power ro&s;e, and life &s;prung, and in the ari&s;ings there|of many living te&s;timonies were borne again&s;t that wicked, dividing, rending &s;pirit, which tho&s;e oppo&s;ers were joined to and acted by: and the meeting ended to the &s;atisfaction of friends. That night I lodged, with other friends, at Thomas Ellwood's; and the &s;ame week I had a meeting again with tho&s;e oppo&s;ers at Wickham, where they again &s;hewed their envy, and were made manife&s;t to the upright-hearted.</P>
<P>After I had vi&s;ited friends in that upper &s;ide of Bucking|ham&s;hire, I called at Henley in Oxford&s;hire, and went by Cau&s;ham to Reading, where I was at meeting on fir&s;t-day, and in the evening had a large meeting with friends. Next day there being another meeting about &s;ettling a women's meeting, &s;ome of tho&s;e that had let in the &s;pirit of divi&s;ion fell into jangling, and were di&s;orderly for awhile, till the weight of truth brought them down. After this I pa&s;&s;ed on, vi&s;iting friends, and having meetings in &s;everal places, through Berk&s;hire and Wilt&s;hire, till I came to Bri&s;tol, which was on the 24th day of the 11th month, ju&s;t before the fair.</P>
<P>I &s;taid at Bri&s;tol the time of the fair, and &s;ometime after. Many &s;weet and precious meetings we had; many friends being there from &s;everal parts of the nation, &s;ome on account of trade, and &s;ome in the &s;ervice of truth. Great was the love and unity of friends that abode faithful in the truth, though &s;ome who were gone out of the holy unity, and were run into &s;trife, divi&s;ion, and enmity, were rude and abu&s;ive, and behaved them&s;elves in a very unchri&s;tian manner to|wards me. But the Lord's power was over all; by which being pre&s;erved in the heavenly patience, which can bear injuries for his name's &s;ake, I felt dominion therein over the rough, rude, and unruly &s;pirits; and left them to the Lord, who knew my innocency, and would plead my cau&s;e. The more the&s;e laboured to reproach and vilify me, the more did the love of friends, that were &s;incere and upright-hearted, abound towards me; and &s;ome, that had been be|trayed by the adver&s;aries, &s;eeing their envy and rude beha|viour, broke off from them; who have cau&s;e to ble&s;s the Lord for their deliverance.</P>
<P>When I left Bri&s;tol, I went with Richard Snead to a hou&s;e of his in the country, and from thence to Hezekiah
<PB N="253" REF="037441_0769_100D9360D63C3AF0">Coale's at Winterburn in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, whither came &s;e|veral friends that were under great &s;ufferings for truth's &s;ake, whom I had invited to meet me there. Stephen Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith, Richard Snead, and I, drew up a breviate of their &s;ufferings, &s;etting forth the illegal proceedings again&s;t them; which was delivered to the judges at the a&s;&s;izes at Glouce&s;|ter; and they promi&s;ed to put a &s;top to tho&s;e illegal pro|ceedings. Next day we pa&s;&s;ed to Sudbury, and had a large meeting in the meeting-hou&s;e, which at that time was of very good &s;ervice. We went next day to Nathaniel Crips's at Tedbury, and from thence to Nail&s;worth; where on fir&s;t-day we had a brave meeting and large. From thence we went to the quarterly meeting at Finchcomb, where were &s;everal of the oppo&s;ite &s;pirit, who (it was thought) intended to have made di&s;turbance among&s;t friends; but the Lord's power was over, and kept them down, and good &s;er|vice for the Lord we had at that meeting. We returned from Einchcomb to Nail&s;worth, and had another very pre|cious meeting there, to which friends came from the &s;everal meetings thereabouts; which made it very large al&s;o.</P>
<P>We went from Nail&s;worth the fir&s;t of the fir&s;t month, 1677-8, and travelled, vi&s;iting friends, and having many meetings at Cirence&s;ter, Crown-Allins, Cheltenham, Stoke-Orchard, Tewk&s;bury, &amp;c. &s;o went to Worce&s;ter, where I had formerly &s;uffered impri&s;onment above a year for the truth's &s;ake; and friends rejoiced greatly to &s;ee me there again. Here I &s;taid &s;everal days, and had many very precious meetings in the city, and much &s;ervice among&s;t friends. After which I had meetings at Per&s;hore and Eve&s;|ham; then &s;truck to Ragley in Warwick&s;hire, to vi&s;it the lady Conway, who I under&s;tood was very de&s;irous to &s;ee me, and whom I found tender and loving, and willing to have detained me longer than I had freedom to &s;tay. About two miles from hence I had two meetings at a friend's hou&s;e, who&s;e name was John Stanley, whither Wil|liam Dew&s;bury came, and &s;taid with me about half a day. I vi&s;ited friends in their meetings at Stratford, Lamcoat, and Arm&s;cott (from whence I was &s;ent pri&s;oner to Worce&s;|ter in the year 1673) and thence pa&s;&s;ed into Oxford&s;hire, vi&s;iting friends, and having meetings at Sibbard, North-Newton, Banbury, Adderbury, &amp;c. Then vi&s;iting friends through Buckingham&s;hire, at Long-Crendon, I&s;mer, Men|dle, We&s;ton, Chol&s;berry, Che&s;ham, &amp;c. I came to I&s;aac Penington's, where I &s;taid a few days; then turning into
<PB N="254" REF="037441_0770_100D93638979EB28">Hertford&s;hire, vi&s;ited friends at Charlewood. Watford, Hemp&s;tead, and Market-&s;treet, at which places I had meet|ings with friends. From Market-&s;treet I went in the morn|ing to Luten in Bedford&s;hire, to &s;ee John Crook, with whom I &s;pent good part of the day, and went towards evening to Alban's, where I lay that night at an inn. And vi&s;iting friends at South-Mims, Barnet, and Hendon, where I had meetings, I came to London the eighth of the third month. It being the fourth-day, I went to Gracechurch|&s;treet meeting, which was peaceable and well; many friends, not knowing I was come to town, were very joyful to &s;ee me there, and the Lord was pre&s;ent with us, refre&s;hing us with his living virtue; ble&s;&s;ed be his holy name!</P>
<P>The parliament was &s;itting when I came to town, and friends having laid their &s;ufferings before them, were waiting on them for relief again&s;t the laws made again&s;t Popi&s;h re|cu&s;ants, which they knew we were not; though &s;ome ma|licious magi&s;trates took advantage to pro&s;ecute us in &s;everal parts of the nation upon tho&s;e &s;tatutes. Friends being at|tending that &s;ervice, when I came, I joined them therein; and &s;ome probability there was that &s;omething might have been obtained towards friends ea&s;e and relief in that ca&s;e, many of the parliament-men being tender and loving to|wards us, as believing we were much mi&s;repre&s;ented by our adver&s;aries. But when I went one morning with George Whitehead, to the parliament-hou&s;e, to attend them on friends behalf, on a &s;udden they were prorogued though but for a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>About two weeks after I came to London the yearly meet|ing began, to which friends came out of mo&s;t parts of the nation, and a glorious heavenly meeting we had. Oh the glory, maje&s;ty, love, life, wi&s;dom and unity, that was among&s;t us! The power reigned over all, and many te&s;timonies were borne therein again&s;t that ungodly &s;pirit which &s;ought to make rents and divi&s;ions among&s;t the Lord's people; but not one mouth was opened among&s;t us in its, defence, or on its behalf. Good and comfortable accounts al&s;o we had, for the mo&s;t part, from friends in other countries; of which I find a brief account in a letter which &s;oon after I wrote to my wife, the copy whereof here follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear heart,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO whom is my love in the everla&s;ting Seed of life, that reigns over all. Great meetings here have been,
<PB N="255" REF="037441_0771_100D7F9F8B98AC78">and the Lord's power hath been &s;tirring through all, the like hath not been. The Lord hath in his power knit friends wonderfully together, and his glorious pre&s;ence did appear among friends. And now the meetings are over (ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord!) in quietne&s;s and peace. From Holland I hear that things are well there. Some friends are gone that way, to be at the yearly meeting at Am&s;ter|dam. At Embden, friends that were bani&s;hed are got into the city again. At Dantzick, friends are in pri&s;on, and the magi&s;trates threatened them with harder impri&s;onment; but the next day the Lutherans ro&s;e, and plucked down or defaced the Popi&s;h mona&s;tery, &s;o they have work enough them&s;elves. The king of Poland did receive my letter, and read it him&s;elf; and friends have &s;ince printed it in High Dutch. By letters from the half-yearly meeting in Ireland I hear they are all in love there. At Barbadoes friends are in quietne&s;s, and their meetings &s;ettled in peace. At Antigua al&s;o and Nevis truth pro&s;pers, and friends have their meetings orderly and well. Likewi&s;e in New-England, and other places, things concerning truth and friends are well; and in tho&s;e places the men's and wo|men's meeting are &s;ettled; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord! So keep in God's power and Seed, that is over all, in whom ye all have life and &s;alvation; for the Lord reigns over all, in his glory, and in his kingdom; glory to his name for ever, Amen! So in ha&s;te, with my love to you all, and to all friends.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To Johannes III. king of Poland, &amp;c.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>O king!</P>
<P>WE de&s;ire thy pro&s;perity both in this life and that which is to come. And we de&s;ire that we may have our Chri&s;tian liberty to &s;erve and wor&s;hip God under thy dominion: for our principle leads us not to do anything prejudicial to the king or his people. We are a people that exerci&s;e a good con&s;cience towards God through his Holy Spirit, and in it do &s;erve, wor&s;hip, and honour him; and
<PB N="256" REF="037441_0772_100D936596C72188">towards men in the things that are equal and ju&s;t, doing to them as we would have them do unto us; looking unto Je&s;us, who is the author and fini&s;her of our faith; which faith purifies our hearts, and brings us to have acce&s;s to God; without which we cannot plea&s;e him: by which faith all the ju&s;t live, as the &s;cripture declares. That which we de&s;ire of thee, O king, is, that we may have the liberty of our con&s;ciences to &s;erve and wor&s;hip God, and to pray unto him in our meetings together in the name of Je&s;us, as he commands: with a promi&s;e that he will be in the mid&s;t of them. The king, we hope, can|not but &s;ay that this duty and &s;ervice is due to God and Chri&s;t; and we give Cae&s;ar his due, and pay our tribute and cu&s;tom equal with our neighbour, according to our proportion. We never read in all the &s;criptures of the New Te&s;tament, that ever Chri&s;t or his di&s;ciples did ba|ni&s;h or impri&s;on any that were not of their faith or religi|on, and would not hear them, or gave any &s;uch com|mand; but, on the contrary, let the tares and the wheat grow together till the harve&s;t, and the harve&s;t is the end of the world. Then Chri&s;t will &s;end his angels to &s;ever the wheat from the tares. He rebuked &s;uch as would have had fire from heaven to con&s;ume tho&s;e that would not receive Chri&s;t; and told them they did not know what &s;pirit they were of; he came not to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them.</P>
<P>We de&s;ire the king to con&s;ider how much per&s;ecution has been in Chri&s;tendom, &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, concern|ing religion. Chri&s;t &s;aid, They &s;hould go into everla&s;t|ing puni&s;hment that did not vi&s;it him in pri&s;on; then what will become of them that impri&s;on him in his mem|bers, where he is manife&s;t. None can &s;ay the world is ended; therefore how will Chri&s;tendom an&s;wer the dread|ful and terrible God at his day of judgment, that have per&s;ecuted one another about religion before the end of the world, under a pretence of plucking up tares; which is not their work, but the angels at the end of the world? Chri&s;t commands men to love one another, and to love enemies; and by this they &s;hould be known to be his di&s;|ciples. O that all Chri&s;tendom had lived in peace and unity, that they might by their moderation have judged both Turks and Jews; and let all have their liberty, that own God and Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and walk as becomes the glo|rious go&s;pel of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Our de&s;ires are,
<PB N="257" REF="037441_0773_100D9367A95252C8">that the Lord God of heaven may &s;often the king's heart to all tender con&s;ciences that fear the Lord, and are afraid of di&s;obeying him.</P>
<P>We intreat the king to read &s;ome of the noble expre&s;|&s;ions of &s;everal kings, and others, concerning liberty of con&s;cience; and e&s;pecially Stephanus king of Poland's &s;ayings, viz. <Q>It belongeth not to me to reform the con|&s;ciences; I have always gladly given that over to God which belongeth to him; and &s;o &s;hall I do now, and al&s;o for the future. I will &s;uffer the weeds to grow till the time of harve&s;t, for I know that the number of believ|ers are but &s;mall: therefore,</Q> &s;aid he, when &s;ome were proceeding in per&s;ecution, <Q>I am king of the people, not of their con&s;ciences.</Q> He al&s;o affirmed, that <Q>religion was not to be planted with fire and &s;word.</Q> Chron. Li|berty of Religion, Part 2.</P>
<P>Al&s;o a book wrote in French by W. M. anno 1576, hath this &s;entence, viz. <Q>Tho&s;e princes that have ruled by gentlene&s;s and clemency added to ju&s;tice, and have exerci&s;ed moderation and meekne&s;s towards their &s;ubjects, always pro&s;pered and reigned long; but, on the contrary, tho&s;e princes that have been cruel, unju&s;t, prejudiced, and oppre&s;&s;ors of their &s;ubjects, have &s;oon fallen, they and their e&s;tates, into danger or total ruin.</Q></P>
<P>Veritus &s;aith, <Q>Seeing Chri&s;t is a Lamb, whom you profe&s;s to be your head and captain, then it behoveth you to be &s;heep, and to u&s;e the &s;ame weapons which he made u&s;e of: for he will not be a &s;hepherd of wolves and wild bea&s;ts, but only of &s;heep. Wherefore, if you lo&s;e the nature of &s;heep,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>and be changed into wolves and wild bea&s;ts, and u&s;e fle&s;hly weapons, then will you exclude your&s;elves out of his calling, and for&s;ake his ban|ner; and then will not he be your captain,</Q>&amp;c.</P>
<P>Al&s;o we find it a&s;&s;erted by king James, in his &s;peech to the parliament, in the year 1609, <Q>That it is a pure rule in divinity, that God never planted his church with vio|lence of blood.</Q> And further he &s;aid, <Q>It was u&s;ually the condition of Chri&s;tians to be per&s;ecuted, but not to per&s;ecute.</Q></P>

<P>The prince of Orange te&s;tified, Anno 1579, <Q>That it was impo&s;&s;ible the land &s;hould be kept in peace, except there was a free toleration in the exerci&s;e of religion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Where ha&s;t thou read in thy day (&s;aid Menno) in the writings of the apo&s;tles, that Chri&s;t or the apo&s;tles ever cried out to the magi&s;trate for their power again&s;t them that would not hear their doctrine, nor obey their words? I know certainly (&s;aid he) that where a magi&s;trate &s;hall bani&s;h with the &s;word, there is not the right knowledge, &s;piritual word, nor church of Chri&s;t; it is, Invocate brachium &s;eculare (to invoke the &s;ecular arm).</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is not Chri&s;tian-like, but tyrannical (&s;aid D. Philip|&s;on) to bani&s;h and per&s;ecute people, about faith and reli|gion; and they that do &s;o are certainly of the Phari&s;aical generation, who re&s;i&s;ted the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Era&s;mus &s;aid, <Q>Though they take our monies and goods, they cannot therefore hurt our &s;alvation; they af|flict us much with pri&s;ons, but they do not thereby &s;epa|rate us from God.</Q> In de Krydges wrede, fol. 63.</P>
<P>Lucemus &s;aid, <Q>He that commandeth any thing where|with he bindeth the con&s;cience, this is an antichri&s;t.</Q> In de Bemi&s;e Di&s;p. fol. 71.</P>
<P>Irenoeus affirmed, <Q>That all forcing of con&s;cience, though it was but a forbidding of the exerci&s;e which is
<PB N="259" REF="037441_0775_100D936CD7FBDCB0">e&s;teemed by one or another to be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, is in nowi&s;e right nor fitting.</Q> He al&s;o affirmed, <Q>That through the diver&s;ity of religions the kingdom &s;hould not be brought into any di&s;turbance.</Q></P>
<P>Con&s;tantius the emperor &s;aid, <Q>It was enough that he pre&s;erved the unity of the faith, that he might be excu&s;a|ble before the judgment-&s;eat of God; and that he would leave every one to his own under&s;tanding, according to the account he will give before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t. Hereto may we &s;tir up people, (&s;aid he) not compel them; be&s;eech them to come into the unity of the Chri&s;tians, but to do violence to them, we will not in any-wi&s;e.</Q> Seba&s;t. Frank Chron. fol. 127.</P>
<P>Augu&s;tinus &s;aid, <Q>Some di&s;turbed the peace of the church, while they went about to root out the tares before their time; and through this error of blindne&s;s are they them&s;elves &s;eparated &s;o much the more from being united unto Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Retnaldus te&s;tified, <Q>That he, who with impri&s;oning and per&s;ecuting &s;eeketh to &s;pread the go&s;pel, and grea&s;eth his hands with blood, &s;hall much rather be looked upon for a wild hunter, than a preacher or a defender of the Chri&s;tian religion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have for a long &s;ea&s;on determined (&s;aid Henry IV. king of France, in his &s;peech to the parliament 1599) to reform the church, which without peace I cannot do: and it is impo&s;&s;ible to reform or convert people by violence. I am king, as a &s;hepherd, and will not &s;hed the blood of my &s;heep: but will gather them through the mildne&s;s and goodne&s;s of a king, and not through the power of tyran|ny: and I will give them that are of the reformed reli|gion, right liberty to live and dwell free, without being examined, perplexed, mole&s;ted, or compelled to any thing, contrary to their con&s;ciences; for they &s;hall have the free exerci&s;e of their religion,</Q> &amp;c. [Vid. Chron. Van de Underg. 2 deel, p. 1514.]</P>
<P>Ennius &s;aid, <Q>Wi&s;dom is driven out, when the matter is acted by force. And therefore the be&s;t of men, and mo&s;t glorious of princes, were always ready to give tolera|tion.</Q></P>
<P>Eu&s;ebius, in his &s;econd book of the life of Con&s;tantine, reports the&s;e words of the emperor: <Q>Let them which err with joy receive the like fruition of peace and quietne&s;s with the faithful, &s;ith the re&s;toring of communication and
<PB N="260" REF="037441_0776_100D936E70557960">&s;ociety may bring them into the right way of truth; let none give mole&s;tation to any; let every one do as he de|termines in his mind. And indeed the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is great rea&s;on for princes to give toleration to di&s;agreeing per&s;ons, who&s;e opinions cannot by fair means be altered: for if the per|&s;ons be confident, they will &s;erve God according to their per&s;ua&s;ions; and if they be publickly prohibited, they will privately convene; and then all tho&s;e inconvenien|ces and mi&s;chiefs, which are arguments again&s;t the per|mi&s;&s;ion of conventicles, are arguments for the publick per|mi&s;&s;ion of differing religions, &amp;c. they being re&s;trained and made mi&s;erable, endears the di&s;contented per&s;ons mu|tually, and makes more hearty and dangerous confedera|tions.</Q></P>
<Q>The like coun&s;el in the divi&s;ions of Germany, at the fir&s;t reformation, was thought rea&s;onable by the emperor Ferdinand and his excellent &s;on Maximilian; for they had ob&s;erved, that violence did exa&s;perate, was unble&s;t, un&s;ucce&s;sful, and unrea&s;onable; and therefore they made decrees of toleration.</Q>
<P>The duke of Savoy, repenting of his war undertaken for religion again&s;t the Piedmonte&s;e, promi&s;ed them tolera|tion; and was as good as his word.'</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that till the time of Ju&s;tinian the em|peror, Anno Domini 525. <Q>the Catholicks and Nova|tians had churches indifferently permitted, even in Rome it&s;elf.</Q></P>
<Q>And Paul preached the kingdom of God, teaching tho&s;e things which concerned the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with all con&s;idence, and no man forbad him; and this he did for the &s;pace of two years in his own hired hou&s;e at Rome, and received all that came to him.</Q>
<P>Now, O king, &s;eeing the&s;e noble te&s;timonies concerning liberty of con&s;cience of kings, emperors, and others, and the liberty that Paul had at Rome in the days of the hea|then emperor, our de&s;ire is, that we may have the &s;ame li|berty at Dantzick to meet together in our own hired hou|&s;es, which cannot be any prejudice either to the king or the city of Dantzick, for us to meet together to wait upon the Lord, and pray unto him, and to &s;erve and wor&s;hip him in Spirit and truth in our own hired hou&s;es; &s;eeing our principle leads us to hurt no man, but to love our enemies, and to pray for them, yea, them that per&s;ecute us. Therefore, O king, con&s;ider, and the city of Dant|zick,
<PB N="261" REF="037441_0777_100D93706BDC35E0">would you not think it hard for others to force you from your religion to another, contrary to your con&s;cien|ces? And if it be &s;o, that you would think it hard to you, then <Q>do you unto others as you would have them do unto you,</Q> do not you that unto others which you would not have men do unto you; for that is the royal law, which ought to be obeyed.

<P>I continued yet in and about London &s;ome weeks, the parliament &s;itting again, and friends attending to get &s;ome redre&s;s of our &s;ufferings, which about this time were very great and heavy upon many friends in divers parts of the nation; they being very unduly pro&s;ecuted upon the &s;ta|tutes
<PB N="262" REF="037441_0778_100D9372075F63E0">made again&s;t popi&s;h recu&s;ants; though our per&s;ecutors could not but know friends were utterly again&s;t popery, having borne te&s;timony again&s;t it in word and writing, and &s;uffered under it. But though many of the members of parliament in either hou&s;e were kind to friends, and willing to have done &s;omething for their ea&s;e; yet having much bu&s;ine&s;s they were hindered from doing the good they would, &s;o that the &s;ufferings upon friends were continued.</P>
<P>But that which added much to the grief and exerci&s;e of friends was that &s;ome, who made profe&s;&s;io of the &s;ame truth with us, being gone from the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel into fle&s;hly liberty, and labouring to draw others after them, did oppo&s;e the order and di&s;cipline which God by his pow|er had &s;et up and e&s;tabli&s;hed in his church; and made a great noi&s;e and clamour again&s;t pre&s;criptions; whereby they ea&s;ily drew after them &s;uch as were loo&s;ely inclined, and de|&s;ired a broader way than the path of truth to walk in. Some al&s;o that were more &s;imple, but young in truth, or weak in judgment, were apt to be betrayed by them, not knowing the depths of Satan in the&s;e wiles: for who&s;e &s;ake I was moved to write the following paper, for the undeceiving the deceived, and opening the under&s;tandings of the weak in this matte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL that deny pre&s;criptions without di&s;tinction, may as well deny all the &s;criptures, which were given forth by the power and Spirit of God. For do they not pre&s;cribe how men &s;hould walk towards God and man, both in the Old Te&s;tament and in the New? Yea, from the very fir&s;t promi&s;e of Chri&s;t in Gene&s;is, what people ought to believe and tru&s;t in; and all along, till ye come to the prophets? Did not the Lord pre&s;cribe to his peo|ple by the fathers, and then by his prophets? Did he not pre&s;cribe to the people how they &s;hould walk, though they turned again&s;t the prophets in the old covenant for declaring or pre&s;cribing to them the way how they might walk to plea&s;e God, and keep in favour with him? In the days of Chri&s;t, did he not pre&s;cribe and teach how people &s;hould walk and believe? and after him, did not the apo&s;|tles pre&s;cribe unto people how they might come to be|lieve, and receive the go&s;pel and the kingdom of God, directing unto that which would give them the knowledge of God, and how they &s;hould walk in the new covenant in the days of the go&s;pel, and by what way they &s;hould
<PB N="263" REF="037441_0779_100D937451B737A0">come to the holy city? And did not the apo&s;tles &s;end forth their decrees by faithful cho&s;en men (that had ha|zarded their lives for Chri&s;t's &s;ake) to the churches, by which they were e&s;tabli&s;hed? So you, that deny pre&s;crip|tions given forth by the power and Spirit of God, do thereby oppo&s;e the Spirit that gave them forth in all the holy men of God. Were there not &s;ome all along in the days of Mo&s;es, in the days of the prophets, in the days of Chri&s;t, and in the days of his apo&s;tles, who did with&s;tand that which they gave forth from the Spirit of God? And hath there not been the like &s;ince the days of the apo&s;tles? How many have ri&s;en, &s;ince truth appeared, to oppo&s;e the order which &s;tands in the power and Spirit of God? who are but in the &s;ame &s;pirit which hath oppo&s;ed the Spirit of God all along from the beginning. See what names or titles the Spirit of God gave that oppo&s;ing &s;pirit in the old covenant, and al&s;o in the new; which is the &s;ame now; for after the Lord had given &s;orth the old covenant, there were &s;ome among them&s;elves that did oppo&s;e; which were wor&s;e than publick enemies. And likewi&s;e in the days of the new covenant, in the go&s;pel-times, you may &s;ee what &s;ort oppo&s;ed Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles after they came to &s;ome &s;ight of the truth; and how they turned again&s;t Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles? See what liberty they pleaded for and ran into in the apo&s;tles days, who could not abide the cro&s;s, the yoke of Je&s;us. We &s;ee the &s;ame rough and high &s;pirit crie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> now for liberty (which the power and Spi|rit of Chri&s;t cannot give) and cries, "Impo&s;ition," yet is impo&s;ing; cries, "Liberty of con&s;cience," and yet is op|po&s;ing liberty of con&s;cience; cries again&s;t pre&s;criptions, and yet is pre&s;cribing both in words and writing. So with the everla&s;ting power and Spirit of God this &s;pirit is fathomed, its ri&s;e beginning, and end; and it is judged. This Spirit cries, <Q>We mu&s;t not judge con&s;cience, we mu&s;t not judge matters of faith, we mu&s;t not judge &s;pirits, nor religions,</Q> &amp;c. Yes: they that are in the pure Spirit and power of God, which the apo&s;tles were in judge of con&s;cience, whether it be a &s;eared con&s;cience, or a tender con&s;cience; they judge of faith, whether it be a dead one, or a living one; they judge of religion, whether it be vain, or pure and undefiled; they judge of &s;pirits, and try them. whether they be of God, or no; they judge of hope, whe|ther it be that of hypocrites, or the true hope that purifies. even as God is pure; they judge of belief, whether it be
<PB N="264" REF="037441_0780_100D9377815A11C0">that which is born of God, and overcometh the world, or that which runs into the &s;pirit of the world, which lu&s;ts to envy, and doth not overcome the world; they judge of wor&s;hips, whether they be will-wor&s;hips, and the wor&s;hip of the bea&s;t and dragon, or the wor&s;hip of God in Spirit and in truth; they judge of angels, whether they be fallen, or tho&s;e that keep their habitation; they judge the world, that grieves and quenches the Spirit, hates the light, turns the grace of God into wantonne&s;s, and re&s;i&s;ts the Holy Gho&s;t. They judge of the hearts, ears and lips, which are circumci&s;ed, and which are uncircumci&s;ed. They judge of mini&s;ters, apo&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and me&s;&s;engers, whether they be of Satan or of Chri&s;t. Judge of differences in outward things, in the church or el&s;ewhere; yea, the lea&s;t member of the church hath power to judge of &s;uch things, Laving the one true mea&s;ure and true weight to weigh things and mea&s;ure things withal, without re&s;pect to per&s;ons. This judgment is given, and all the&s;e things are done by the &s;ame power and Spirit the apo&s;tles were in. Such al&s;o can judge of election and reprobation, and who keep their habitation, and who not; who are Jews, and who are of the &s;ynagogue of Satan; who are in the doctrine of Chri&s;t, and who are in the doctrines of devils; who pre&s;cribes and declares things from the power and Spirit of God, to pre|&s;erve all in the power and Spirit of God, and who pre|&s;cribes and declares things from a loo&s;e &s;pirit, to let all loo&s;e from under the yoke of Chri&s;t, the power of God, into loo&s;ene&s;s and liberty. The&s;e likewi&s;e can judge and di&s;cern who brings people into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel of light and life, over death and darkne&s;s, and into the truth where the devil cannot get in; and who brings them into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of death and darkne&s;s, out of the glori|ous liberty of the go&s;pel, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his faith, truth, Spirit, light, and grace. For there is no true liber|ty but in that; and that liberty an&s;wers the grace, the truth, the light, the Spirit, the faith, the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t in every man and woman, and is the yoke to the contrary in every man and woman. That makes it rage, and &s;well, and puff up; for that is re&s;tle&s;s, unruly, out of patience, and ready to cur&s;e his God, and that which reigns over him, becau&s;e it hath not its will. It works with all &s;ub|tilty and eva&s;ion with its re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit, to get in and defile the minds of the &s;imple, and to make rapes upon the vir|gin minds. But as they receive the heavenly wi&s;dom, by
<PB N="265" REF="037441_0781_100D9379145EE7A0">which all things were made (which wi&s;dom is above that &s;pirit) through this wi&s;dom they will be pre&s;erved over that &s;pirit. And Chri&s;t hath given judgment to his &s;aints in his church, though he be judge of all; and the &s;aints, in the power and Spirit of God, had and have power to judge of words and manners, of lives and conver&s;ations, growths, and &s;tates, from a child to a father in the truth; and to whom they are a &s;avour of death, and to whom they are a &s;avour of life; and who &s;erve the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and preach him, and who preach them&s;elves, and &s;erve them&s;elves; and who talk of the light, of faith, of the go&s;pel, of hope, of grace, and preach &s;uch things; yet in their works and lives deny them all, and God and Chri&s;t, and preach up liberty, from that in them&s;elves to that in others, which &s;hould be under the yoke and cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, the power of God. So the &s;aints in the power and Spirit of Chri&s;t can di&s;cern and di&s;tingui&s;h who &s;erves God and Chri&s;t, and who &s;erves him not; and can put a di&s;tinction between the prophane and the holy. But &s;uch as have lo&s;t their eye-&s;alve, and their &s;ight is grown dim, lo&s;e this judgment, di&s;cerning, and di&s;tinction in the church of Chri&s;t; and &s;uch come to be &s;pewed out of Chri&s;t's mouth, except they repent: and if not, they come to corrupt the earth, and burden it, that it vomits them out of it. Therefore all are exhorted to keep in the power and Spirit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in the word of life and the wi&s;|dom of God (which is above that which is below) in which they may keep their heavenly under&s;tandings and heaven|ly di&s;cernings; and &s;o &s;et the heavenly &s;piritual judgment over that which is for judgment, which di&s;honours God, which leads into loo&s;e and fal&s;e liberty; out of the unity which &s;tands in the heavenly Spirit, which brings to be conformable to the image of the Son of God, and his go&s;|pel, the power of God (which was before the devil was) and his truth (which the devil is out of) in which all are of one mind, heart, and &s;oul, and come to drink into one Spirit, being baptized into one Spirit, and &s;o into one bo|dy, which Chri&s;t is the head of; and &s;o keep one fellow|&s;hip in the Spirit, and unity in the Spirit, which is the bond of peace, the Prince of Princes peace. And tho&s;e that cry &s;o much again&s;t judging, and are afraid of judg|ment, whether they be apo&s;tles, profe&s;&s;ors, or prophane, are the mo&s;t judging with the cen&s;orious &s;al&s;e &s;pirits and judgment; yet cannot bear the true judgment of the Spirit
<PB N="266" REF="037441_0782_100D937B4DED75D0">of God, nor &s;tand in his judgment. This hath been ma|nife&s;t from the beginning, they having the fal&s;e mea&s;ures and the fal&s;e weights: for none have the true mea&s;ure and the true weight, but who keep in the light, power, and Spi|rit of Chri&s;t. There is a loo&s;e &s;pirit that cries for liberty, and again&s;t pre&s;criptions, yet is pre&s;cribing ways, both by words and writings. The &s;ame &s;pirit cries again&s;t judging, and would not be judged, yet is judging with a wrong &s;pirit. This is given forth in reproof to that &s;pirit.</P>

<P>I went from Hertford to a meeting at Rabley Heath, and thence to Edward Crouch's of Stevenage. Next day I went to Baldock where I had a meeting that evening, and after had meetings at Hitchin and A&s;hwell. Then pa&s;&s;ing through part of Bedford&s;hire, where I had a meeting or two, I went to Huntingdon, in which county I &s;taid &s;everal days, having many meetings, and much &s;ervice among&s;t friends;

<P>DEAR friends of the quarterly and monthly meetings every where: My de&s;ire is, that you may all &s;trive to be of one mind in the Lord's power and truth, which is peaceable (into which &s;trife and enmity cannot come) and al&s;o in the wi&s;dom of God, which is pure, peaceable, and ea&s;y to be intreated (which is above that which is below, that is earthly, devili&s;h, and &s;en&s;ual) and that in this hea|venly wi&s;dom that is peaceable, and ea&s;y to be intreated, you may be all ordered, and do what ye do to God's glo|ry.

If any man or woman have any thing again&s;t any one, let them &s;peak to one an|other, and end it betwixt them&s;elves; if they cannot &s;o end it, let them take two or three to end it. In ca&s;e the&s;e de|termine it not, let it be laid before the church; and let half a dozen, or a proper number out of your monthly or quarterly meeting hear it, and finally end it, without re&s;|pect of per&s;ons.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO you is my love in the heavenly Seed, in whom all nations are ble&s;&s;ed. Oh, keep all in this Seed, in which ye are ble&s;&s;ed, and in which Abraham and all the &s;aithful were ble&s;&s;ed, without the deeds of the law: for the promi&s;e was and is to and with the Seed, and not with the law of the fi&s;t covenant. In this Seed all nations and ye are ble&s;&s;ed, which brui&s;eth the head of the &s;eed that brought the cur&s;e, and &s;eparated man from God. This is the Seed which reconciles you to God; and this is the Seed in which ye are ble&s;&s;ed both in temporals and &s;pirituals; through which ye have an inheritance among the &s;anctified, that cannot be defiled, neither can any defiled thing enter into its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; for all defilements are out of his Seed. This is that which leavens into a new lump, and brui&s;eth the head of the wicked &s;eed that leavens into the old lump, upon whom the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s goes down and &s;ets, but never goes down and &s;ets to them that walk in the Seed in which all nations are ble&s;&s;ed; by which Seed they are brought up to God, which puts down that &s;eed which &s;e|parated them from God, &s;o that there comes to be nothing be|twixt them and God. Now all my dear friends, my de&s;ires are, that ye may all be valiant in this heavenly Seed for God and his truth upon the earth, and &s;pread it abroad, an|&s;wering that of God in all; that with it the minds of peo|ple may be turned towards the Lord, that he may come to be known, &s;erved, and wor&s;hipped, and that ye may all be as the &s;alt of the earth, to make the un&s;ea&s;oned &s;avoury. And in the name of Je&s;us keep your meetings, who are gathered into it, in who&s;e name ye have &s;alvation; he be|ing in the mid&s;t of you, who&s;e name is above every name
<PB N="271" REF="037441_0787_100D93882E9913C0">under the whole heaven. So ye have a Prophet, Bi&s;hop, Shepherd, Prie&s;t, and Coun&s;ellor (above all the coun&s;el|lors, prie&s;ts, bi&s;hops, prophets, and &s;hepherds under the whole heaven) to exerci&s;e his offices among you, in your meetings, gathered in his name. For Chri&s;t's meeting and gathering is above all the meetings and gatherings under the whole heaven; and his body, his church, and he the head of it, is above all the bodies, churches, and heads under the whole heaven. And the faith that Chri&s;t is the author of, and the wor&s;hip that he hath &s;et up, and his fellow&s;hip in the go&s;pel, is above all hi&s;torical faiths, and the faiths that men have made, together with their wor|&s;hips and fellow&s;hips under the whole heaven. And now, dear friends, keep your men's and women's meetings in the power of God, the go&s;pel, the authority of them, which brings life and immortality to light in you; and this go&s;|pel, the power of God, will pre&s;erve you in life and in immortality (which hath brought it to light in you) that ye may &s;ee over him that hath darkened and kept from the knowledge of the things of God: for it is he and his in&s;truments (which hath darkened you from life and im|mortality) that would throw down your men's and wo|men's meetings (which were &s;et up in the power of God, the go&s;pel) and would darken you again from this life and immortality which the go&s;pel hath brought to light, and will pre&s;erve you therein, as your faith &s;tands in this power of God, the go&s;pel, in which every one &s;ees your work and &s;ervice for God. Every heir in the power of God, the go&s;pel, hath right to this authority, which is not of man not by man; which go&s;pel, the power of God, is everla&s;ting, an everla&s;ting order, an everla&s;ting fellow&s;hip: and in the go&s;pel is everla&s;ting joy, comfort, and peace, which will outla&s;t all tho&s;e joys, comforts, and peaces that will have an end, and that &s;pirit al&s;o that oppo&s;es its order and glorious fellow&s;hip, peace and comfort in it. And, my dear friends, my de&s;ire is, that ye may keep in the unity of the Spirit, that baptizes you all into one body, which Chri&s;t is the heavenly and &s;piritual head of, &s;o that ye may &s;ee and bear witne&s;s to your heavenly and &s;piritu|al head, and &s;o all drink into the one Spirit, which all people on the earth are not like to do, while they grieve, quench, and rebel again&s;t it, nor to be baptized into one body, and to keep the unity of the Spirit, which is the bond of peace, yea the King of kings and Lord of lords

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friends and brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHO are a&s;&s;embled together in the name and power of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, fill all your hearts, and e&s;tabli&s;h you in his grace, mercy, and peace upon Chri&s;t, the holy living Rock and Foundation, who is the Fir&s;t and La&s;t, and over all the foundations and rocks in the whole world; a Rock and Foundation of life for all the living to build upon, which &s;tands &s;ure in his heavenly, divine light, which is the life in him; by whom all things were made, who is the precious Stone laid in Sion (and not in the world) which all the wi&s;e ma&s;ter|builders rejected, who pretended to build people up to heaven with the words of the prophets, and the law from mount Sinai, but out of the life of both: therefore &s;uch builders could not receive the law of life from Chri&s;t, the precious Stone laid in Sion, nor the word from heavenly Jeru&s;alem. But you, my dear friends, that have received this law from heavenly Sion, and the word from heavenly Jeru&s;alem, in the new convenant, where the life and &s;ub|&s;tance is enjoyed, you &s;ee the end and aboli&s;hing of the Jews law and ceremonies from mount Sinai. And there|fore my de&s;ire is, that you may all keep in the law of life and love, which ye have in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, by which love the body is edified, knit, and united together to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Head. Which love doth bear all things, fulfils the law, will pre&s;erve all in humility, and in it to be of one mind, heart, and &s;oul. So all may come to drink into that one Spirit, that doth baptize them and circumci&s;e them, plunging down and cutting off the body of the &s;ins of the fle&s;h, that is got up in man and woman by their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing of God's commands. So that in this holy pure Spirit all may &s;erve and wor&s;hip the pure God in &s;pirit and in truth. which is over all the wor&s;hips that are out of God's Spirit and his truth. In this Spirit ye will all have a &s;piritual unity and fellow&s;hip over all the fellow|&s;hips of the unclean &s;pirits, which are out of truth in the world. By this holy Spirit all your hearts, minds, and
<PB N="274" REF="037441_0790_100D938E7275E860">&s;ouls may be knit together to Chri&s;t, from whence it comes; and by the grace and truth, which is come by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which all &s;hould be under the teachings of in the new covenant, and not under the law, as the outward Jews were in the old covenant. By this grace and truth in the new covenant, all may be made God's free men and women, to &s;erve God in the new life, the new and living way; &s;hewing forth the fruits of the new heart and new Spirit, in the new covenant, over death and darkne&s;s. Glory be to the Lord for ever! In this grace and truth is heavenly, gracious, and true liberty to every &s;piritual mind, which makes you free from him that is out of truth, where your bondage was. Al&s;o your liberty in the holy, divine, and precious faith, which gives you victory over that which once &s;eparated you from God and Chri&s;t, by which faith ye have acce&s;s to God again through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. So in this divine and holy faith, ye have divine, holy, and precious liberty, yea and victory over him that &s;eparated you from God; and this faith is held in a pure con&s;cience. So the liberty in the &s;pirit of God is in that which baptizes and plunges down &s;in and iniquity, and puts off the body of death and &s;ins of the fle&s;h, that are got up by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing God's command. And al&s;o the liberty of the go&s;pel, which is &s;ent from heaven by the Holy Gho&s;t, which is the power of God, which was and is again to be preached to all nations; in this go&s;pel is the true liberty, and the go&s;pel-fellow&s;hip and order. So that the evil &s;pirit or con&s;cience, or fal&s;e dead faith, that which is ungracious, out of truth, and not in the Spirit of God, nor in his go&s;pel, nor in the divine faith, its liberty is in the darkne&s;s; for all true liberty is in the go&s;pel, and in the truth that makes free; in the faith, in the grace, and in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who de&s;troys the devil and his works, that hath brought all mankind into bondage. So in this hea|venly, peaceable Spirit, truth, and faith, which works by love, and in the go&s;pel of peace, and in Chri&s;t Je&s;us is all the &s;aints peace, and pure, true, and holy liberty; in which they have &s;alt, &s;ome, feeling, di&s;cerning, and &s;avour, yea and unity and fellow&s;hip one with another, and with the Son and the Father, that heavenly, eternal fellow&s;hip. So all being &s;ubject to the grace and truth, and to the faith and go&s;pel (the power of God) and to his good Spirit, in this they di&s;tingui&s;h all true, pure, and holy liberty from that which is fal&s;e. This will bring all to &s;it low; for pa|tience
<PB N="275" REF="037441_0791_100D93909D3F55D0">runs the race, and the Lamb mu&s;t have the victory; and not the rough, unruly, and vain talkers, unbaptized, uncircumci&s;ed, and un&s;antified. Such travel not in the way of regeneration, but in the way of unregeneration: neither go they down into the death with Chri&s;t by bap|ti&s;m. Such are not like to reign with him in his re&s;ur|rection, who are not buried with him in bapti&s;m. There|fore all mu&s;t go downward into the death of Chri&s;t, and be crucified with him, if they will ari&s;e and follow him in the regeneration before they come to reign with him. And, friends, many may have precious openings; but I de&s;ire all may be comprehended in that which doth open to them, and that they may all keep in the daily cro&s;s; then they keep in the power that kills and crucifies that which would lead them among&s;t the bea&s;ts and goats, to leaven them into their rough, unruly &s;pirit; that through the cro&s;s, the power of God, that may be crucified, and they in the power might follow the Lamb. For the power of God keeps all in order, &s;ubjection, and humility, in that which is lovely, virtuous, decent, comely, temperate, and moderate; &s;o that their moderation comes to appear to all men. My de&s;ire is, that all your lights may &s;hine as from a city &s;et upon a hill, that cannot be hid; and that ye may be the &s;alt of the earth, to &s;alt, &s;ea&s;on, and make it &s;avoury to God, and you all &s;ea&s;oned with it. Then all your &s;a|crifices will be a &s;weet &s;avour to the Lord, and ye will be as the lilies and ro&s;es, and garden of God, which gives a &s;weet &s;mell unto him: who&s;e garden is pre&s;erved by his power, the hedge that hedges out all the unruly and un|&s;avoury, the de&s;troyers and hurters of the vines, buds, and plants, and God's tender blade, which &s;prings up from his &s;eed of life, who waters it with his heavenly water and word of life every moment, that they may grow and be fruitful; that &s;o he may have a plea&s;ant and fruitful garden. Here all are kept fre&s;h and green, being watered every moment with the everla&s;ting holy water of life from the Lord, the fountain. My dear friends, my de&s;ire is, that this hea|venly &s;eed, that brui&s;es down the head of the &s;erpent both within and without, may be your crown and life, and ye in him one another's crown and joy, to the prai&s;e of the Lord God over all, ble&s;&s;ed for evermore. This holy &s;eed will outla&s;t and wear out all that which the evil &s;eed &s;ince the fall of man hath brought forth and &s;et up. As every one hath received Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord, &s;o walk in him
<PB N="276" REF="037441_0792_100D939356E0F6D0">in the humility which he teaches: and &s;hun the occa&s;ions of &s;trife, vain janglings, and di&s;putings with men of cor|rupt minds, who are de&s;titute of the truth; for the truth is peaceable, the go&s;pel is a peaceable habitation in the power of God; his wi&s;dom is peaceable and gentle, and his kingdom &s;tands in peace. Oh! his glory &s;hines over all his works! in Chri&s;t Je&s;us ye will have peace, who is not of the world; yea a peace that the world cannot take away; for the peace which ye have from him was be|fore the world was, and will be when it is gone. This keeps all in that which is weighty and &s;ub&s;tantial over all chaff. Glory to the Lord God over all for ever and ever! Amen.</P>
<P>And now, my dear friends, the Lord doth require more of you than he doth of other people, becau&s;e he hath com|mitted more to you. He requires the fruits of his Spirit, of the light, of the go&s;pel, of the grace, and of the truth; for herein is he glorified (as Chri&s;t &s;aid) in your bringing forth much fruit, fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s, holine&s;s, godline&s;s, virtue, truth, and purity; &s;o that ye may an&s;wer that which is of God in all people.

In this Spirit we have the bond of peace, which cannot be broken except ye go from the Spirit, and then ye lo&s;e this unity and bond of peace, which ye have from the Prince of peace.</P>
<P>The world al&s;o expects more from friends than from other people; becau&s;e you profe&s;s more. Therefore you &s;hould be more ju&s;t than others in your words and dealings, more righteous, holy and pure in your lives and conver|&s;ations, &s;o that your lives and conver&s;ations may preach. For the world's tongues and mouths have preached long enough; but their lives and conver&s;ations have denied what their tongues have profe&s;&s;ed and declared.</P>
<P>And, dear friends, &s;trive to excel one another in virtue, that ye may grow in love, that excellent way which unites all to Chri&s;t and God. Stand up for God's glory, and mind that which concerns the Lord's honour, that in no wi&s;e his power may be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ed, nor his name evil &s;poken of by any evil talkers or walkers; but that in all things God may be honoured, and ye may glorify him in your bodies, &s;ouls and &s;pirits, the little time ye have to live.

The next day having a &s;en&s;e upon me that &s;ome who had received the truth, and had openings thereof, for want of keeping low had run out therefrom, I was moved to give forth the following epi&s;tle, as a <Q>warning and exhortation to all to dwell in humility.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHOM the Lord in his tender mercies hath vi&s;ited with the day-&s;pring from on high, and hath opened you to confe&s;s and bow to his name; keep low in your minds, and learn of Chri&s;t who teacheth you humility, to keep in it; &s;o that in no wi&s;e ye that be younger be ex|alted, puffed up, or conceited through your openings, and by that means lo&s;e your conditions, by being carried up into pre&s;umption; then fall into de&s;pair, and &s;o abu&s;e the power of God. For it was the apo&s;tles care, that none &s;hould abu&s;e the power of the Lord God; but in all things their faith was to &s;tand therein, that they all might be comprehended into the truth which they &s;poke to others, that they might not be preachers to others and them&s;elves ca&s;t-aways. Therefore it doth concern you to be comprehended into that which ye preach to others, and keep low in it; then the God of truth will exalt the hum|ble in his truth, light, grace, power, and Spirit, and in his wi&s;dom to his glory. Here all are kept in their mea&s;ures of grace, light, faith, and the Spirit of Chri&s;t, the heavenly and &s;piritual Man. So let none quench the Spirit, nor its motions, nor grieve it, nor err from it; but be led by it, which keeps every one in their tents; which Holy Spirit of God giveth them an under&s;tanding, how to &s;erve, wor|&s;hip, and plea&s;e the holy, pure God, their Maker and Creator in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and how to wait, &s;peak, and an|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wer the Spirit of God in his people: in which holy Spi|rit is the holy unity and fellow&s;hip.

About the latter end of this year I was moved of the Lord to travel into the &s;outh again. I &s;et forward the be|ginning of the fir&s;t month, 1679-80, and pa&s;&s;ing through part of We&s;tmoreland and Lanca&s;hire, I vi&s;ited friends at &s;everal meetings, and came into York&s;hire. Divers large and weighty meetings I had in York&s;hire, before I came to York city. When I came there it was the a&s;&s;ize-time, and there being many friends in pri&s;on for truth's &s;ake, I put tho&s;e at liberty upon drawing up the &s;ufferings of the friends in pri&s;on, that they might be laid before the judges; and I affi&s;ted them therein. The quarterly meeting of friends was al&s;o at that time, &s;o I had a brave opportunity among&s;t them. Many weighty and &s;erviceable things did the Lord open through me to the meeting, relating to the inward &s;tate of man; how man by faith in Chri&s;t comes to be graft|ed into him, and made a member of his &s;piritual body; and al&s;o the outward &s;tate of the church, how each member ought to walk and act, according to its place in the body. I &s;pent &s;everal days in York, having divers meetings; and all was peaceable and well. I went al&s;o to the ca&s;tle, to vi&s;it the pri&s;oners; with whom I &s;pent &s;ome time, encou|raging and &s;trengthening them in their te&s;timony.</P>
<P>Then leaving York, I travelled &s;outhward, having meet|ings among&s;t friends, till I came to Burton in Lincoln&s;hire; where on fir&s;t-day I had a large and precious meeting. Then turning into Nottingham&s;hire, I travelled through good part of that county, in which I had &s;everal very good meetings, and then pa&s;&s;ed into Derby&s;hire, Leice&s;ter&s;hire, and Warwick&s;hire, having meetings all along as I went, till I came to Warwick: there William Dew&s;bury came to me, and &s;everal other friends; and we had a little meeting in that town. Then pa&s;&s;ing through Southam and Radway, at each of which places I had a very good meeting, I came to Nathaniel Ball's, of North-Newton, in Oxford&s;hire, and &s;o to Banbury to a monthly meeting there. After I had vi&s;ited friends at their meetings in the bordering parts of Oxford&s;hire, Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, and Northampton&s;hire, I pa&s;|&s;ed to Richard Baker's, of Biddle&s;den, in Buckingham&s;hire; and the next day, being fir&s;t-day, I had a very large meet|ing in Biddle&s;den, at an old abbey-hou&s;e, which a friend rented and dwelt in. Many friends and people came to this meeting out of Oxford&s;hire, Northampton&s;hire, and the parts adjacent; and of good &s;ervice it was. After this, I vi&s;ited friends in tho&s;e parts, having meetings at Lilling|&s;tone,
<PB N="280" REF="037441_0796_100D939BCB273598">Lovel, and Bugbrook. Then going to Stony-&s;trat|for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, I went into &s;ome parts of Bedford&s;hire, till I came to Edward Che&s;ter's of Dun&s;table. Whence pa&s;&s;ing on by Market-&s;treet, I had a meeting at Albans; and calling on friends at Mims and Barnet, I came to the widow Haly's, at Gutter&s;hedge, in Hendon, Middle&s;ex, on a &s;eventh-day night, and had a very large and good meeting there the day following.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed from thence to London the third-day following, and went directly to the Peel-meeting at John El&s;on's, and next morning to the meeting at Gracechurch-&s;treet, which was very large and quiet; and friends rejoiced in the Lord to &s;ee me. The yearly meeting was in the week following, to which many friends came out of mo&s;t parts of the nation, and a ble&s;&s;ed opportunity the Lord gave us together; where|in the ancient love was &s;weetly felt, and the heavenly life flowed abundantly over all. After the yearly meeting, I continued about a month or five weeks in and about Lon|don, labouring in the work of the Lord both in and out of meetings; for be&s;ides the publick te&s;timony, which the Lord gave me to bear both to friends and to the world in meet|ings, I had much &s;ervice lay upon me with re&s;pect to friends &s;ufferings, in &s;eeking to get ea&s;e and liberty for them in this and other nations. Much pains and time I &s;pent while I was at London, in writing letters to friends in divers parts of England, and in Scotland, Holland, Barbadoes, and &s;everal other parts of America.</P>
<P>After this I was moved of the Lord to vi&s;it friends in &s;ome parts of Surrey and Su&s;&s;ex. I went to King&s;ton by water, and tarried certain days; for while I was there, the Lord laid it upon me to write both to the great Turk and the dey of Algiers &s;everally, to warn them and the people under them to turn from their wickedne&s;s, and fear the Lord, and do ju&s;tly, le&s;t the judgments of God &s;hould come upon them, and de&s;troy them without remedy. To the Algerines I wrote more particularly, concerning the cruelty they exerci&s;ed towards friends and others, whom they held captives in Algiers. When I had fini&s;hed that &s;ervice, and vi&s;ited friends in their meetings at King&s;ton, I went further into the country, and had meetings among&s;t friends at Wor|ple&s;don, Guild&s;ord, E&s;her, Capell, Patchgate, Worming|hur&s;t. Bletchington, Hor&s;ham, I field, Ryegate, Gatton, &amp;c. and &s;o came back to King&s;ton again, and from thence to Hammer&s;mith. And having &s;pent &s;ome days in the &s;ervice

<P>When I had been about ten days in London, I was drawn again to vi&s;it friends in the country; and went to Edmonton to Chri&s;topher Taylor's, who kept a &s;chool for the education of friends children. I had &s;ome &s;ervice among&s;t the youth, and then went towards Hertford, vi&s;it|ing friends in the way. At Hertford I met with John Story, and &s;ome others of his party; but the te&s;timony of truth went over them, and kept them down, &s;o that the meeting was quiet. It was on a fir&s;t-day, and the next day being the men's and women's meeting for bu&s;ine&s;s, I vi&s;ited them al&s;o; and the rather becau&s;e &s;ome in that place had let in a di&s;e&s;teem of them. Whereupon I was moved to open the &s;ervice of tho&s;e meetings, and the u&s;efulne&s;s and benefit thereof to the church of Chri&s;t, as the Lord opened the thing in me; and it was of good &s;ervice to friends. I had a meeting al&s;o with &s;ome of tho&s;e that were gone into &s;trife and contention, to &s;hew them wherein they were wrong; and having cleared my&s;elf of them. I left them to the Lord. After another publick meeting in the town <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> returned to|wards London by Waltham-abbey, where I had a publick meeting the fir&s;t-day following, and another with friends in the evening.

<P>I abode at London mo&s;t part of this winter, having much &s;ervice for the Lord there, both in and out of meetings; for as it was a time of great &s;ufferings among friends, I was drawn in &s;pirit to vi&s;it friends meetings more frequently, to encourage and &s;trengthen them by exhortation and exam|ple.

To clear our innocency and &s;top the mouths of our adver&s;aries, I drew up a &s;hort paper to be delivered to the parliament; as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>IT is our principle and te&s;timony to deny and renounce all plots and plotters again&s;t the king, or any of his &s;ubjects; for we have the Spirit of Chri&s;t, by which we have the mind of Chri&s;t, who came to &s;ave men's lives, and not to de&s;troy them. We de&s;ire the &s;afety of the king and all his &s;ubjects.

This we do &s;incerely offer unto you. But as to &s;wearing and fighting, which in tenderne&s;s of con|&s;cience we cannot do, ye know that we have &s;uffered the&s;e many years for our con&s;cientious refu&s;al thereof. And now that the Lord hath brought you together, we di&s;ire you to relieve and free us from tho&s;e &s;ufferings, and that ye will not put upon us to do tho&s;e things which we have &s;uffered &s;o much and &s;o long already for not doing; for if ye do, ye will make our &s;ufferings and bonds &s;tronger in|&s;tead of relieving us.</P>

<P>About this time I received two very envious books writ|ten again&s;t truth and friends; one of them by a doctor (&s;o called) of Bremen, in Germany, the other by a prie&s;t, of Dantzick, in Poland. They were both full of gro&s;s fal&s;e|hoods and reproachful &s;landers. I found it upon me to an&s;wer them, and that I might not be over-much interrupt|ed by other bu&s;ine&s;s and company, I went to King&s;ton upon Thames, where I wrote an an&s;wer to each of them,

<P>While I was there I wrote al&s;o the following paper, to per&s;uade the magi&s;trates to moderation towards di&s;&s;enters, and take off their edge to per&s;ecution. Becau&s;e it &s;hould have its full &s;ervice, I directed it&mdash;</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To all the rulers, magi&s;trates, and law-makers in En|gland, Scotland, and Ireland, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, and to all other magi&s;trates every-where in that which is called Chri&s;tendom; de&s;iring their health, peace, tranquillity, life, and &s;alvation in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Lord of Glory and Lamb of God, who takes away the &s;ins of the world, and is the King of kings and Lord of lords, to whom all power in heaven and in earth is given, and who will reward every man according to his words and works.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU that bear the name of Chri&s;tian magi&s;trates, my de&s;ire is that you may all be found in Chri&s;t, and not only have the name, but be made partakers of his divine nature; that ye may be not only &s;ayers of the word, but doers of the word, not only profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;t, and talkers of Chri&s;t, but let Chri&s;t rule in your hearts by faith, and be walkers in Chri&s;t. For as Chri&s;t's great apo&s;|tle &s;aith, <Q>As every one hath received the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;o let him walk in him; for in him there is peace.</Q> If all that profe&s;s Chri&s;t did walk in Chri&s;t, they would walk in peace, and be in unity; for the apo&s;tle exhorted the Chri&s;tians in his day to keep the unity of the Spirit. which is the bond of peace, yea of Chri&s;t the King of kings peace. All Chri&s;tians who have the &s;criptures, and are not in this Spirit of Chri&s;t, are not in unity one with another, and &s;o have broken this bond of peace, which &s;hould knit and unite them together. Likewi&s;e all that profe&s;s the truth of Chri&s;t &s;hould live in it; for it is peace|able, and the go&s;pel is the go&s;pel of peace; which if all Chri&s;tians lived in, they would be at peace one with an|other, and in the glorio the glorious fellow&s;hip of the go&s;pel. And if all Chri&s;tians kept in the fear of God, which is the be|ginning of the pure, heavenly, peaceable, and gentle wi&s;|dom, which is ea&s;y to be intreated (above that wi&s;dom which is earthly, &s;en&s;ual, devili&s;h, and de&s;troying) there
<PB N="284" REF="037441_0800_100D93A4CFD690C0">would be no difference and de&s;troying about matters of religion.</P>
<P>I do declare the mighty day of the Lord is come and coming, and the Lord God is come to teach his people him&s;elf by his Son (Hebrews i.) who brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head, that fal&s;e teacher, that led Adam and Eve from God their Teacher. God will teach his people by his Son, the Teacher of Adam and Eve in paradi&s;e, before they fell, di&s;obeyed the Lord and for&s;ook him, and followed the &s;erpent; who&s;e head Chri&s;t brui&s;eth, and renews man and woman up again into the image of God which Adam and Eve were in before they fell: glory and honour be to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath called us by his Son into his glorious image, to &s;erve and wor&s;hip him in his Spirit and truth; which holy Spirit and truth the devil is out of, and cannot come into.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire all Chri&s;tian magi&s;trates to take heed of per&s;e|cuting any, though they di&s;&s;er from you in matters of faith, wor&s;hip, and religion. For Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>Let the tares and the wheat grow together till the harve&s;t;</Q> and he forbad &s;uch as would be plucking up tares: the rea&s;on was, "Le&s;t they &s;hould pluck up the, wheat al&s;o;" for Chri&s;t &s;aid, it &s;hould be his angels work to &s;eparate the tares from the wheat. Moreover Chri&s;t &s;aid, they &s;hould go into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment that did not vi&s;it him in pri&s;on in his members; then what will become of them that ca&s;t him into pri&s;on, where he is made manife&s;t in his members! Oh! lay the&s;e things to heart! A day of jud ment will come, vengeance and recompen&s;e upon eve|ry one according to their works.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e di&s;ciples, who would have had fire to come down from heaven to con&s;ume them that would not re|ceive him, he turned about, rebuked, and told them, <Q>They did not know what &s;pirit they were of; for he came not to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them.</Q></P>
<P>Therefore let all magi&s;trates and prie&s;ts, in that which is called Chri&s;tendom, con&s;ider who have de&s;troyed men and women's lives &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, becau&s;e they could not receive the religions, ways, and wor&s;hips, which they have made and &s;et up; have they known that &s;pirit they have been of? Are they nor all reproved by, and come under the judgment of Chri&s;t? Therefore let all per&s;ecution be laid a&s;ide concerning religion; let love beat the &s;way, to overcome evil and en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mies; let patience over|&s;way
<PB N="285" REF="037441_0801_100D93A665476948">pa&s;&s;ion in all, that all may retain the heavenly rea&s;on and the pare under&s;tanding, that your moderation in true Chri&s;tianity may be known to all men. For have you not the Turks. Jews, Tartars, Indians, and Athei&s;ts eyes upon you? Therefore be in unity, and let not the name of God and Chri&s;t be bla&s;phemed among&s;t them by means of any that bear the name of Chri&s;tians. So God may be glorified by all and in all through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is over all, who calls all to peace, and is ble&s;&s;ed for ever.</P>
<P>I would have you to be as noble as the Bereans, and &s;earch the &s;criptures of Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles. Where did he or they give any command to impri&s;on, bani&s;h, per&s;ecute, or put to death any that would not receive or conform to them, or that were contrary-minded to them in religion, or differed from them in matters of wor&s;hip?</P>
<P>Again I de&s;ire all Chri&s;tian magi&s;trates to &s;earch both criptures and chronicles, and &s;ee what was the end of all per&s;ecutors, and what judgments came upon them. What fell upon Cain, who was the fir&s;t per&s;ecutor for matters of faith and &s;acrifice? Did not he become a vagabond and a fugitive in the earth? What became of the old world that grieved God, and Noah, a preacher of righteou&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;s? What became of Sodom that vexed ju&s;t Lot? What be|came of Pharaoh that per&s;ecuted God's people in Egypt? (though the more he per&s;ecuted them the more they grew) What became of Ahab and Jezebel that per&s;ecuted the Lord's prophets? And what became of Haman that would have de&s;troyed the Jews? What became of the Jews and Jeru&s;alem that per&s;ecuted Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles? What was the end of all the&s;e? Are they not become vagabonds in the earth, and driven away from their native country? Therefore I be&s;eech you in the love and fear of God, be &s;o noble as to &s;earch both &s;cripture and hi&s;tory, and let not your divine under&s;tanding be clouded. What will become of the bea&s;t and whore &s;poken of in the Revela|tions, with their fal&s;e prophets, that have drunk the blood of the &s;aints, martyrs, and prophets of Je&s;us? Mu&s;t they not all go with the devil, who is a murderer, de&s;troyer, an I adver&s;ary of mankind, into the lake of &s;ire that burns with brim&s;tone? Ye may be &s;ure that &s;pirit that &s;tirs you up to per&s;ecution, let it be in whom&s;oever it will, is not of Chri&s;t, and of his lamb-like nature, who takes away the &s;ins of the world, not the lives of men.</P>
<P>Paul was a per&s;ecutor a haler to pri&s;on, before he was
<PB N="286" REF="037441_0802_100D93A8CA650A90">converted to Chri&s;tianity, but never after. And therefore are not all in Saul's nature, let them be of what name or profe&s;&s;ion &s;oever, that are per&s;ecutors, and unconverted into Paul's life of Chri&s;tianity? He &s;aid the life that he lived after he was converted, was by faith in the Son of God; and that he lived, yet not he, but <Q>Chri&s;t lived in him,</Q> who came to &s;ave men's lives, and not to de&s;troy them. This life &s;hould be the life of all Chri&s;tians now, which Paul in his converted &s;tate lived in. And the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>The law is good, if a man u&s;e it lawfully; knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawle&s;s, for the ungodly and &s;inners, for unholy and prophane, for murderers of fathers and mo|thers, for man&s;layers, for whoremongers, and for them that defile them&s;elves with mankind, for men-&s;tealers, liars, and perjured per&s;ons,</Q> 1 Tim. i. So the law in its place is good again&s;t &s;uch. Again the apo&s;tle &s;ays, <Q>The law was added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</Q> Gal. iii. 19. Here all magi&s;trates may &s;ee what the law in its place is good again&s;t, and what it was made for and again&s;t, and what evils, the apo&s;tle &s;ays, it takes hold upon. He does not &s;ay, the law &s;hould be laid upon men that differed from them in their religion and judgment, nor upon right|eous men. So you may &s;ee in what condition the law is good, and what it was made again&s;t; not again&s;t righteous men, again&s;t whom they have nothing, only becau&s;e they differ from them in matters of religion; letting man&s;layers, whoremongers, perjured per&s;ons, ungodly, prophane per|&s;ons, liars, &amp;c. go unpuni&s;hed; &s;o do not u&s;e, nor execute the law lawfully, as the apo&s;tle &s;ays; <Q>The law is good, if a man u&s;e it lawfully.</Q> Therefore it ought to be u&s;ed lawfully; which law, the apo&s;tle &s;ays, is for the puni&s;h|ment of evil-doers, and a prai&s;e to them that do well, as may be &s;een, Rom. xiii. So, as the apo&s;tle &s;aid, <Q>We do not break the law, nor make it void; but we e&s;tabli&s;h the law,</Q> Rom. iii. 31.</P>

<P>About this time I had occa&s;ion to go to &s;everal of the judges chambers, upon a &s;uit about tithes. For my wife and I, with &s;everal other friends, were &s;ued in Cartmel Wa|pentake Court in Lanca&s;hire, for &s;mall tithes, and we had demurred to the juri&s;diction of that court. Whereupon the plaintiff pro&s;ecuted us in the exchequer court at We&s;tmin|&s;ter; where they run us up to a writ of rebellion, for not an&s;wering the bill upon oath, and got an order of court to the &s;erjeant to take me and my wife into cu&s;tody. This was a little before the yearly meeting, at which time it was thought they would have taken me up; and according to outward appearance it was likely, and very ea&s;y for him to have done it, I lodging at the &s;ame places where I u&s;ed to lodge, and being very publick in meetings. But the Lord's power was over them, and re&s;trained them, &s;o that they did not take me. Yet under&s;tanding a warrant was out again&s;t me, as &s;oon as the yearly meeting was well over, I took William Mead with me, and went to &s;everal of the judges chambers, to let them under&s;tand both the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, and the ground and rea&s;on of our refu&s;ing to pay tithes. The fir&s;t we went to was judge Gregory, to whom I ten|dered mine and my wife's an&s;wer to the plainti&s;&s;'s bill; in
<PB N="289" REF="037441_0805_100D93AF6D6EAD20">which was &s;et forth, That my wife had lived three-and-forty years at Swarthmore, and in all that time there had been no tithe paid nor demanded: and an old man, who had long been a tithe-gatherer, had made affidavit that he never gathered tithe at Swarthmore Hall in judge Fell's time, nor &s;ince. There were many particulars in our an&s;wer, but it would not be accepted without an oath. I told the judge, that both tithe and &s;wearing among Chri&s;tians came from the pope; and it was matter of con&s;cience to us not to pay tithes, nor to &s;wear; for Chri&s;t bid his di&s;ciples, who had freely received, give freely; and he commanded them, <Q>Not to &s;wear at all.</Q> The judge &s;aid. There was tithe paid in England before popery was. I a&s;ked him by what law or &s;tatute they were paid then? but he was &s;ilent. Then I told him, there were eight poor men brought up to London out of the north about two hundred miles, for &s;mall tithes; one of them had no family, but him&s;elf and his wife, and kept no living creature but a cat. I a&s;ked him al&s;o, Whe|ther they could take a man and his wife, and impri&s;on them both for &s;mall tithes, and &s;o de&s;troy a family? If they could, I de&s;ired to know by what law? He did not an&s;wer me; but only &s;aid, That was an hard ca&s;e. When I found there was no help to be had there, we left him, and went to judge Montague's chamber. With him I had a great deal of di&s;|cour&s;e concerning tithes. Whereupon he &s;ent for our ad|ver&s;ary's attorney; and when he came, I offered him our an&s;wer. He &s;aid, If we would pay the charges of the court, and be bound to &s;tand trial, and abide the judgment of the court, we &s;hould not have the oath tendered to us. I told him, they had brought tho&s;e charges upon us, by requiring us to put in our an&s;wer upon oath; which they knew before we could not do for con&s;cience-&s;ake; and as we could not pay any tithe, nor &s;wear, &s;o neither &s;hould we pay any of their charges. Upon this he would not receive our an&s;wer. So we went from thence to judge Atkyns's chamber; and he being bu&s;y, we gave our an&s;wers and our rea&s;ons again&s;t tithes and &s;wearing to his clerk; but neither could we find any encouragement from him to expect redre&s;s. Where|fore leaving him, we went to one of the mo&s;t noted coun&s;el|lors, and &s;hewed him the &s;tate of our ca&s;e, and our an&s;wers: he was very civil to us, and &s;aid, <Q>This way of proceeding again&s;t us was &s;omewhat like an inqui&s;ition.</Q> A few days after, tho&s;e eight poor friends, that were brought up &s;o far out of the north, appeared before the judges and the Lord
<PB N="290" REF="037441_0806_100D93B1CC533A48">was with them, and his power was over the court, &s;o that the friends were not committed to the Fleet. Our cau&s;e was put off till the next term (called Michaelmas term) and then it was brought before the four judges again. William Mead told the judges, that I had engaged my&s;elf never to meddle with my wife's e&s;tate. The judges could hardly believe that any man would do &s;o; whereupon he &s;hewed them the writing under my hand and &s;eal; at which they wondered. Then two of the judges and &s;ome of the law|yers &s;tood up and pleaded for me, that I was not liable to the tithes; but the other two judges and divers lawyers 'pre&s;&s;ed earne&s;tly to have me &s;eque&s;tered, alleging that I 'was a publick man. At length they prevailed with one of the other two judges to join with them, and then granted a &s;eque&s;tration again&s;t me and my wife together. There|upon, by advice of coun&s;el, we moved for a limitation, which was granted; and that much defeated our adver&s;ary's de&s;ign in &s;uing out the &s;eque&s;tration; for this limited the plaintiff to take no more than was proved. One of the judges, baron We&s;ton, was very bitter, and broke forth in a great rage again&s;t me in the open court: but in a little time after he died.</P>
<P>After the yearly meeting I tarried about a month in London; then went into Su&s;&s;ex to vi&s;it friends there, among&s;t whom I had many large and very precious meet|ings in divers parts of that county. Yet I &s;pent not much time in Su&s;&s;ex, but returned pretty &s;oon to London, whi|ther I felt drawings in my &s;pirit; and had very good &s;ervice for the Lord there, both in publick meetings and among&s;t friends. When I had tarried &s;ometime in London, I went to Edmonton; and from thence into Buckingham&s;hire, where I vi&s;ited friends at &s;everal meetings in the upper &s;ide of that county; and then went by Henley to Reading, where I tarried &s;everal meetings. I went no farther we&s;t|ward at this time than Ore, where I had a very large meet|ing; after which, &s;triking through the edge of Oxford&s;hire, I had a large and very precious meeting at Warborough, in which the glory of the Lord &s;hined over all. Many friends came to this meeting out of Berk&s;hire, Buckingham|&s;hire, and Hamp&s;hire. From thence I pa&s;&s;ed to Ilmore in the Vale of Buckingham&s;hire, where we had a glorious meet|ing. The day following I returned to Mary Penington's. From whence I vi&s;ited the men's and women's monthly meetings at Hungerhill, and &s;ome other meetings there|abouts;
<PB N="291" REF="037441_0807_100D93B38B95E588">then pa&s;&s;ed to Watford, where was a marriage of two friends, at which I was pre&s;ent. A very large meeting we had on that occa&s;ion, and the Lord's power was over all. I went from Watford to Longford in Middle&s;ex, vi&s;iting friends at Uxbridge in the way. At Longford we had a large meeting, it being on fir&s;t-day, and the pre&s;ence of the Lord was preciou&s;ly felt among&s;t us; ble&s;&s;ed be his name! I pa&s;&s;ed from Longford to King&s;ton, vi&s;iting friends as I went, at Staines and Sunbury. At King&s;ton I abode with friends two meetings, wherein we were &s;weetly refre&s;hed together in the Lord. Pa&s;&s;ing from thence towards London, I had a very precious meeting at Wand&s;worth: then cro&s;&s;ing over to Hammer&s;mith. I had a good meeting there; which was the larger by rea&s;on of a burial, and there being a pretty open|re&s;s in the people on that occa&s;ion, I had a fine opportuni|ty to open the way of truth among&s;t them.</P>
<P>After I was come to London, I was moved to write the following paper, concerning that &s;pirit which had led &s;ome who profe&s;&s;ed truth, into &s;trife and divi&s;ion, and to oppo&s;e the way and work of the Lord:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU that keep your habitation in the truth that is over all, do &s;ee that it is the &s;ame &s;pirit which leads the back&s;liders and apo&s;tates now from the &s;piritual fellow&s;hip and unity of the church of Chri&s;t, that led Adam and Eve from God. This &s;pirit was the &s;ame that was in the world, which got into the Jews when they were gone from the Spirit of God; and then turned again&s;t God and his pro|phets, and again&s;t Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. That &s;pirit led them to be as bad as Pilate, or wor&s;e. The enmity or adver&s;ary was got within them again&s;t the truth, and tho&s;e that walked in it, and the Spirit of the Lord; &s;o that they killed and de&s;troyed the Ju&s;t. This was the &s;pirit of the devil, the de&s;troyer, who &s;ought not only to de&s;troy the truth, but the order of it, and tho&s;e that walked in it, when true Chri&s;tianity was planted among the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the light, grace, and truth, the holy go&s;pel faith and Spi|rit, who enjoyed Chri&s;t in their heart. But when &s;ome began to err from the Spirit and faith, to hate the light, di&s;obey the go&s;pel, turn the grace of God into wantonne&s;s, walk de&s;pitefully again&s;t the Spirit of grace, turn from the truth, crucify to them&s;elves Chri&s;t afre&s;h, and put him to open &s;hame; the&s;e were they that let in the &s;pirit of the
<PB N="292" REF="037441_0808_100D93B6C3545350">world, who held the form of godline&s;s, but denied the power thereof; and troubled the churches in the apo&s;tles days. When the &s;pirit of Satan had got into &s;uch, they were more trouble&s;ome to the church than the open per&s;e|cutors without. The&s;e got into the a&s;&s;emblies to deceive the hearts of the &s;imple; having the good words and fair &s;peeches, the &s;heep's clothing. Paul, Peter, John, Jude, and James had much to do with &s;uch, to keep them from troubling the church of Chri&s;t; for they are out of the light, power, and Spirit; therefore the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t exhort|ed the &s;aints to keep to the Word of life within; to the Anointing: to the grace, truth, and Holy Spirit in their hearts. This foul &s;pirit will profe&s;s all the &s;criptures in words; but by the Spirit of God, which is holy, that &s;pi|rit is tried, and its fruits. So the apo&s;tates went from the power and Spirit of God, and turned again&s;t the prophets and martyrs of Je&s;us; and became the whore, who&s;e cup all nations drank of. The dragon with his tail threw down many of the &s;tars, and would have devoured the woman with his flood; but the woman, the true church, was pre|&s;erved, for the gates of hell cannot prevail again&s;t her; and then the dragon made war with her Seed. So the dragon, the whore, bea&s;t, and fal&s;e prophets, all made war again&s;t the Lamb and the &s;aints, but the Lamb and the &s;aints will overcome them, and have the victory. And now the ever|la&s;ting go&s;pel is preached again to all nations, tongues, and people; and many are gathered into the go&s;pel, the power of God, turned to the light, which is the life in Chri&s;t, grafted into him, and are come to walk in the order of the new covenant of light and life, in the go&s;pel of peace and &s;alvation. The &s;ame &s;pirit that oppo&s;ed the apo&s;tles and the churches in their days, oppo&s;es now; yea, it is the &s;ame that oppo&s;ed Chri&s;t and di&s;dained him, that di&s;dain|eth God's &s;ervants now. The &s;ame that oppo&s;ed the pro|phets, and rebelled again&s;t Mo&s;es, oppo&s;es and rebels again&s;t God's &s;ervants and people now. It is the &s;ame dark, blind, di&s;obedient, faithle&s;s, wilful, jealous &s;pirit, that per&s;e|cutes &s;ome with the hands, and others with the tongue. It is the &s;ame &s;pirit that is now going about &s;ometimes like a roar|ing lion, &s;ometimes like a twi&s;ting &s;erpent to tempt, to de|ceive, and to devour, in tho&s;e that have fair &s;peeches and good words, the &s;heep's clothing, in a form of godline&s;s, un|der pretence of light and liberty, but deny the power thereof, and inwardly are ravening wolves. If it were po&s;&s;ible they
<PB N="293" REF="037441_0809_100D93B856828320">would deceive the very elect. But the elect are in the co|venant of light and life, in the power of God over them, and in Chri&s;t, who will grind them to pieces, and &s;lay all his enemies with his &s;piritual &s;word, who will not have him to rule over or in them. In Chri&s;t all his people have re&s;t and peace, who is their &s;anctuary over all &s;torms and tempe&s;ts. In Chri&s;t, the &s;anctuary, no deceiver nor de|&s;troyer can come; for he is a place of &s;weet re&s;t and &s;afe|ty. Hallelujah! prai&s;e the Lord for his &s;anctuary, Amen.</P>

<P>Sufferings continuing &s;evere upon friends at London, I found my &s;ervice lay mo&s;tly there: wherefore I went but lit|tle out of town, and not far; being frequent at the mo&s;t publick meetings, to encourage friends, both by word and example, to &s;tand fa&s;t in the te&s;timony to which God had called them. At other times I went from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, vi&s;iting tho&s;e friends that had their goods taken away for their te&s;timony to truth. And becau&s;e the wicked inform|ers were grown very audacious, by rea&s;on they had much countenance and encouragement from &s;ome ju&s;tices, who, tru&s;ting wholly to their information, proceeded again&s;t friends without hearing them: whereby many were made to &s;uffer, not only contrary to right, but even contrary to law al|&s;o. I advi&s;ed with &s;ome friends about it; and we drew up a paper, which was delivered to mo&s;t of the magi&s;trates in and about the city, as followeth:</P>
<P><Q>WHEREAS informers have obtained warrants of &s;ome ju&s;tices of peace, who have convicted many of us without hearing us, or once &s;ummoning us to appear be|fore them; by which proceedings many have had their goods &s;eized and taken away, being generally &s;ined ten pounds apiece for an unknown &s;peaker: and &s;ome of tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;o fined have not been at the meetings they were fined for; and the &s;peaker notwith&s;tanding hath him&s;elf been fined for the &s;ame meeting, the &s;ame day the others were fined for the unknown &s;peaker. The ju&s;tices may &s;ee the wickedne&s;s of the&s;e informers, by who&s;e fal&s;e oaths we have been convicted for an unknown preacher, when the preacher hath been both known and fined. Al&s;o in their &s;wearing &s;uch per&s;ons to have been at &s;uch a meeting &s;uch a day, when indeed tho&s;e &s;o &s;worn again&s;t have not
<PB N="294" REF="037441_0810_100D7F9E05D19BD8">been at that meeting. By which proceedings &s;everal fa|milies of the king's peaceable &s;ubjects are like to be ruined, if a &s;peedy &s;top be not put thereunto. Therefore we hope and de&s;ire that you, the king's ju&s;tices, for the time to come, when any informers &s;hall come to any of you with an in|formation again&s;t any of us, will &s;ummon &s;uch as are ac|cu&s;ed to appear before you, and hear us and our accu&s;ers face to face; that none may &s;uffer for what they are not guilty of. For Pilate the governor heard Chri&s;t and his accu&s;ers face to face before he condemned him, John xix. The council and chief prie&s;ts heard Stephen and his ac|cu&s;ers, with the witne&s;&s;es that were brought again&s;t him, face to face, before they condemned him, Acts vii. The Roman captain heard Paul and his accu&s;ers face to face. Acts xxiii. Felix the governor heard Paul and Ananias the high-prie&s;t, and the elders that accu&s;ed Paul, face to face, Acts xxiv. And when the high-prie&s;ts and chief of the Jews accu&s;ed Paul to Fe&s;tus, he heard Paul and his accu&s;ers, and them that witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t him, face to face, Acts xxv. Doth the law of God, or did the Roman law, or doth the law of the land judge any man before he and his accu&s;ers, and they that witne&s;s again&s;t him, be heard face to face?</Q></P>
<P>This &s;omewhat moderated the ju&s;tices: and after this &s;e|veral friends, who had been illegally pro&s;ecuted and fined, entered their appeals; upon trial whereof they were acquit|ted, and the informers ca&s;t: which was a great di&s;courage|ment to the informers, and &s;ome relief to friends.</P>
<P>A little before the time for choo&s;ing new &s;heriffs for the ci|ty, tho&s;e who put up to be cho&s;en de&s;iring our friends to give their voices for them, I wrote a few lines, tending to di&s;cover what &s;pirit they were of, and how they &s;tood affect|ed to true liberty; it was by way of inquiry, thus:</P>
<P><Q>DO any here in London, who &s;tand to be cho&s;en &s;he|riffs, own that Chri&s;t, who was crucified without the gates of Jeru&s;alem, to be the light of the world, that "en|lightens every man that cometh into the world," who &s;aith, <Q>Believe in the light, that ye may become children of the light?</Q> Is any of you again&s;t per&s;ecuting people for their religion and wor&s;hip of God in Spirit and truth, as Chri&s;t commandeth? For Chri&s;t &s;aid. <Q>I am not of this world nor my kingdom:</Q> therefore he doth not uphold his &s;pi|ritual
<PB N="295" REF="037441_0811_100D93BC25C33898">wor&s;hip and pure religion with worldly and carnal weapons. Chri&s;t &s;aid, "Swear not at all;" and his apo&s;tle James &s;aith the &s;ame: but will not you force us to &s;wear, and break Chri&s;t's and his apo&s;tle's commands, in putting oaths to us? Chri&s;t &s;aith to his apo&s;tles, <Q>Freely ye have received, freely give:</Q> Will not you force us to give tithes and maintenance to &s;uch teachers as we know God hath not &s;ent? Shall we be free to &s;erve and wor&s;hip God, and keep his and his Son's commands, if we give our voices freely for you? for we are unwilling to give our voices for &s;uch as will impri&s;on and per&s;ecute us, and &s;poil our goods.</Q></P>
<P>But whatever the candidates were, I ob&s;erved heat and &s;trife in the &s;pirits of the people that were to choo&s;e; where|fore I wrote a few lines to be &s;pread among&s;t them, di|rected,</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the people who are choo&s;ing &s;heriffs in London:<LB>
People,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL keep in the gentle and peaceable wi&s;dom of God, which is above that which is earthly, &s;en&s;ual, and devili&s;h; and live in that love of God that is not puffed up, nor is un&s;eemly; which envieth not, but beareth and endureth all things. In this love ye will &s;eek the good and peace of all men, and the hurt of no man. Keep out of all heats, be not hot-headed; but be cool and gentle, that your Chri&s;tian moderation may appear to all men; for the Lord is at hand, who beholds all men's words, thoughts, and actions, and will reward every one according to their work: what every man &s;oweth, that &s;hall he reap.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome inclination to go into the country to a meet|ing: but hearing there would be a bu&s;tle at our meetings, and feeling great di&s;quietne&s;s in people's &s;pirits in the city about choo&s;ing &s;heriffs, it was upon me to go to the meeting in Gracechurch-&s;treet on fir&s;t-day. William Penn went with me, and &s;poke in the meeting. While he was decla|ring the truth, a con&s;table came in with his great &s;taff, and bid him give over, and come down: but William Penn held on, declaring truth in the power of God. After awhile the con&s;table drew back; and when William Penn had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. I &s;tood up and declared to the people <Q>the everla&s;t|ing
<PB N="296" REF="037441_0812_100D93C02031C688">go&s;pel which was preached in the apo&s;tles days, and to Abraham; which the church in the apo&s;tles days did receive, and came to be heirs of. This go&s;pel, I declared, was &s;ent from heaven by the Holy Gho&s;t in the apo&s;tles days, and is &s;o now; and was not of man, neither by man, but by the revelation of the Holy Gho&s;t. And now this go&s;pel is preached again (as John &s;aw, and &s;aid it &s;hould be) to all nations, tongues, and people; and all people now are to hear Chri&s;t the Prophet, in this his go&s;|pel of the new covenant. For as Mo&s;es &s;aid, <Q>Like un|to me will God rai&s;e up a prophet, and him &s;hall ye hear in all things:</Q> &s;o &s;aid I, this prophet Chri&s;t is come, and all the Jews in Spirit, the true believing Chri&s;tians in the light, who have the law of God written in their hearts, and put into their minds, are to hear Chri&s;t in his go&s;pel, new te&s;tament, and new covenant, which is the law of the Spirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head (which is the head of enmity) and makes free from the law of &s;in and death. I &s;hewed, that all whom Chri&s;t quickens and makes alive, he makes to &s;it together in the heavenly places in him&s;elf. So that they do not wander up and down, like the fool's eye in the corners of the earth; nor are their eyes abroad in the world, to &s;it down in the world's invented &s;eats of religion; but they &s;it together in him, as the &s;aints did in the apo&s;tles days. So Chri&s;t was and is their trea&s;ure of wi&s;dom, life, knowledge, and &s;al|vation.</Q> As I was thus &s;peaking, two con&s;tables came in with their great &s;taves, and bid me, <Q>give over &s;peaking and come down.</Q> But I, feeling the power of the Lord with me, &s;poke on therein, both to the con&s;tables, and to the people. To the con&s;tables I declared, <Q>That we were a peaceable people, who meet to wait upon God, and wor|&s;hip 'him in Spirit and in truth; and therefore they needed not to have come with their &s;taves again&s;t us, who were met in a peaceable manner, de&s;iring and &s;eeking the good and &s;alvation of all people.</Q> Then turning my &s;peech to the people again, I declared what further was upon me to them. While I was &s;peaking, the con&s;tables drew towards the door, and the &s;oldiers &s;tood with their mu&s;kets in the yard. When I had done &s;peaking, I kneeled down, and prayed, de&s;iring the Lord to open the eyes and hearts of all people, high and low, that their minds might be turned to God by his Holy Spirit: that he might be glorified in all and over all. After prayer the meeting ro&s;e, and friends
<PB N="297" REF="037441_0813_100D93C259FEA1F0">pa&s;&s;ed away, the con&s;tables being come in again without the &s;oldiers; and indeed both they and the &s;oldiers carried them|&s;elves civilly. William Penn and I went into a room hard by, as we u&s;ed to do, and many friends went with us; and left the con&s;tables &s;hould think we would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them, a friend went down and told them, if they would have any thing with us, they might come where we were, if they plea&s;ed. One of them came to us &s;oon after, but without his &s;taff; which he cho&s;e to do, that he might not be ob&s;erved; for he &s;aid, <Q>The people told him, he bu&s;ied him&s;elf more than he needed.</Q> We de&s;ired to &s;ee his warrant; and we there|in found the informer was one Hilton, a north country man, reputed a Papi&s;t. The con&s;table was a&s;ked, Whe|ther he would arre&s;t us by his warrant on that day, it being fir&s;t-day, which in their law was called the Lord's day? He &s;aid, 'He thought he could not.' He told us al&s;o, <Q>He had charged the informer to come along with him to the meeting, but he had run away from him.</Q> We &s;hewed the con&s;table, that both he and we were clear; yet to free him from all fear of danger, we were free to go to the alder|man that granted the warrant. A friend pre&s;ent &s;aid, He would go with the con&s;table to &s;peak with the alderman; which they did, and came pre&s;ently back again, the alder|man being gone from home. We &s;eeing the con&s;table in a &s;trait, and finding him a tender man, bid him &s;et an hour to come to us again, or &s;end for us, and we would come to him. So he appointed the fifth hour in the afternoon, but neither came nor &s;ent for us; and a friend meeting him af|terwards in the evening, the con&s;table told him, <Q>He thought it would come to nothing, and therefore did not look after us.</Q> So the Lord's power was over all; to him be the glory!</P>
<P>The fourth-day following, it was upon me to go to Grace|church-&s;treet meeting again: for I had heard they would come to break up the meeting that day. The neighbours, it &s;eems, were informed &s;o, a ju&s;tice had granted a warrant for that purpo&s;e, and the con&s;table told a friend that Hilton the informer had been with him about it.

<P>During the time I abode at London, as I had lei&s;ure be|tween meetings, and from other publick &s;ervices, I wrote divers books and papers; &s;ome of which were printed, and others &s;pread about in manu&s;cript.

<P>FRIENDS and brethren in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, whom the Lord hath called and gathered into him&s;elf, in him abide; for without him ye can do nothing, and through him ye can do all things. He is your &s;trength and &s;up|port in all your trials, temptations, impri&s;onments, and &s;ufferings, who for Chri&s;t's &s;ake are accounted as &s;heep for the &s;laughter: in all the&s;e things we are more than conquerors, through Chri&s;t who hath loved us. There|fore, friends, though ye &s;uffer by the outward powers, ye know that the prophets, Chri&s;t, and the apo&s;tles, &s;uffered by the unconverted. And though ye &s;uffer by fal&s;e bre|thren and apo&s;tates for a time, and by their filthy books and tongues, who&s;e tongues indeed are become no &s;lander, let them &s;peak, write, or print what they will: for the &s;ober people even of the world hardly regard it. It is well they have manife&s;ted them&s;elves to the world, that their folly may proceed no farther; though to the utmo&s;t of their power they have &s;hewed their wicked intent to &s;tir up the magi&s;trates, profe&s;&s;ors, and prophane again&s;t us, and to &s;peak evil of the way of truth. God's judgments will overtake them, as &s;ure as they have come upon tho&s;e that are gone before them. Let their pretence be ever &s;o high, mark their end; for they will fall like untimely figs, and wither like the gra&s;s on the top of the hou&s;e. Though they may &s;eem to flouri&s;h, and make a boa&s;t and a noi&s;e for a time, yet the Seed is on the head of &s;uch, which will grind them to powder; which &s;eed brui&s;eth the &s;erpent's head. Therefore in this Seed. Chri&s;t, who is your &s;anctu|ary, re&s;t, peace, and quiet habitation, who is the Fir&s;t and the La&s;t, and over all, in him walk; for the Lord taketh plea&s;ure in his faithful people, that &s;erve and wor&s;hip him. Therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;aints be joyful in glory; and the God

Ca&s;t all your care upon the Lord, for he careth for you. And dearly beloved, think it not &s;trange con|cerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though &s;ome &s;trange thing had happened to you; for it is better, if the will of God be &s;o, that ye &s;uffer for well-doing than for evil-doing; and rejoice, ina&s;much as ye are made par|takers of Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings. Wherefore let them that &s;uf|fer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their &s;ouls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator: for unto you is given, in the behalf of Chri&s;t, not only to believe in him, but al&s;o to &s;uffer for his &s;ake. So it is given, or is a gift from Chri&s;t to &s;uffer for his name; and therefore rejoice, ina&s;much as ye are made partakers of Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings. If ye be reproached or evil-&s;poken of for the name of Chri&s;t, happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God re&s;reth upon you: on their part he is evil-&s;poken of, but on your part he is glorified. There|fore if any &s;uffer as Chri&s;tians, let them not be a&s;hamed, but glorify God on this behalf. Though now for a &s;ea&s;on ye are in &s;ufferings, trials, and temptations, that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than that of gold which peri&s;hes, though it be tried with fire, may be found unto prai&s;e, honour, and glory, who are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto &s;alvation. Therefore mind your keeper, where-ever ye are, or what &s;ufferings &s;oever ye be in; and mind the example of the apo&s;tle, how he &s;uffered trouble as an evil-doer, unto bonds. But the Word of God is not bound, which is everla&s;ting and en|dures for ever: and they who are in that which is not everla&s;ting, and doth not endure for ever, cannot bind the Word. The apo&s;tle &s;aid, <Q>I endure all things for the elect's &s;ake; that they may al&s;o obtain the &s;alvation which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, with eternal glory (mark, with eternal glory.)

<P>I made but little &s;tay at Dal&s;ton, but return<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to London, where I continued mo&s;t part of the winter; labouring in the &s;ervice of truth among&s;t friends: &s;ave that I was a little while at King&s;ton, in the tenth month of this year, where I wrote a book, &s;etting forth <Q>The &s;tate of the birth temporal, and the birth &s;piritual: and the duty and &s;tate of a child, youth, young men, aged men and fathers in the truth,</Q> &amp;c. But I &s;taid not long at King&s;ton neither; for the heat of per&s;ecution &s;till continuing, I felt my &s;ervice to be mo&s;t at London, where our meetings were for the mo&s;t part di&s;|turbed and broken up, or friends were forced to meet with|out doors, being kept out of their meeting-hou&s;es by the
<PB N="303" REF="037441_0819_100D93D043CCEA68">officers. Yet &s;ometimes, beyond expectation, we got a quiet and peaceable meeting in the hou&s;es. One time I was minded to have gone a mile or two out of town, to vi&s;it a friend that was not well: but hearing that the king had &s;ent to the mayor to put the laws in execution again&s;t di&s;&s;enters, and that the magi&s;trates thereupon intended to nail up the meeting-hou&s;e doors, I had not freedom to go out of town, but was moved to go to the meeting at Grace|church-&s;treet; and, notwith&s;tanding all their threats, a great meeting it was, and very quiet; and the glory of the Lord &s;hone over all.</P>
<P>The &s;ame week I went to the meeting at the Peel in John's-&s;treet, and the &s;e&s;&s;ions were holden the &s;ame day at Hicks's-hall. I went in the morning; and William Mead being to appear at the &s;e&s;&s;ions for not going to the &s;teeple-hou&s;e wor&s;hip, came once or twice from Hicks's-hall to me at the Peel; which &s;ome ill-minded people ob&s;erving, went and informed the ju&s;tices at the bench, that he was gone to a meeting at the Peel. Whereupon they &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to &s;ee if there was a meeting; but this being in the forenoon, there was no meeting, &s;o the me&s;&s;enger went back and told them. Then others informed the ju&s;tices that there would be a meeting there in the afternoon: whereupon they &s;ent for the chief con&s;table, and a&s;ked him, <Q>Why he &s;uffered a meeting to be at the Peel, &s;o nigh him?</Q> He told them, 'He did not know of any meeting there.' They a&s;ked him, 'How he could but know it, and live &s;o nigh it?' He &s;aid, <Q>He was never there in his life, and did not know there was a meeting there.</Q> They would have per&s;uaded him that he mu&s;t needs know of it; but he &s;tanding &s;teadfa&s;t in the de|nial of it, they &s;aid, <Q>They &s;hould take order to have it looked after in the afternoon.</Q> But a multitude of bu&s;i|ne&s;s coming before them at the &s;e&s;&s;ions, when dinner-time came, they ha&s;tened to their dinner, without giving order; and when they came to the bench again after dinner, the Lord put it out of their minds, &s;o the meeting was quiet, beginning and ending in peace; and a ble&s;&s;ed meeting we had, the Lord's pre&s;ence being preciou&s;ly among&s;t us. Many friends had a concern upon their minds, when they &s;aw me come into the meeting, le&s;t I &s;hould have been ta|ken; but I was freely given up to &s;uffer, if it was the Lord's will, before I went, and had nothing in my mind concerning it but the Lord's glory. I do believe that the Lord put it out of their minds, that they &s;hould not &s;end to
<PB N="304" REF="037441_0820_100D93D1D44623C8">break up our meeting that day. Yet the fir&s;t-day after, three or four ju&s;tices (as I heard) came to the Peel, and put friends out of their meeting-hou&s;e, and kept them out: and inquired for William Mead, but he was not there.</P>
<P>That day I was moved to go to Gracechurch-&s;treet meet|ing; and it was expected that the officers would come to break up the meeting, or keep friends out; and many hundreds of people came to &s;ee what would be done to us. But the officers came not; &s;o we were in peace and quietne&s;s; and many of the people that came to look on, &s;taid all the time; and a glorious, precious meeting we had, for the Lord's pre&s;ence was plentifully among&s;t us, and his power came over all; glory to his name for ever, who is over all!</P>
<P>I had &s;een the mayor's printed &s;peech for putting the laws in execution again&s;t di&s;&s;enters: and it was much in my mind that we &s;hould draw up a paper to &s;end to the mayor and aldermen, to clear our&s;elves from being &s;uch as tho&s;e laws were made again&s;t; and to &s;et forth our peaceable behaviour both towards the king and the government. Accordingly a paper was drawn up, &s;igned, and delivered to the mayor; and copies thereof delivered to the aldermen, and the bi&s;hop of London, who generally took it kindly, and were civil to the friends that delivered it.</P>
<P>About this time I was moved to write the few lines fol|lowing to friends:</P>

<P>Becau&s;e the magi&s;trates were many of them unwilling to have fines laid upon meeting-hou&s;es, they kept friends out in many places, &s;etting officers and guards of &s;oldiers at the doors and pa&s;&s;ages; yet &s;ometimes friends were fined for &s;peaking or praying, though it were abroad. One fir&s;t-day it was upon me to go to Devon&s;hire-hou&s;e meeting in the afternoon; and becau&s;e I had heard friends were kept out there that morning (as they were that day at mo&s;t meetings about the city) I went &s;omewhat the &s;ooner, and got into the yard, before the &s;oldiers came to guard the pa&s;&s;ages: but the con&s;tables were got there before me, and &s;tood in the door-way with their &s;taves.

<PB N="307" REF="037441_0823_100D93D74E7FD678">the meeting was done, and friends began to pa&s;s away, the con&s;table put off his hat, and de&s;ired the Lord to ble&s;s us: for the power of the Lord was over him and the people.</P>
<P>After this I went up and down, vi&s;iting friends at their hou&s;es, who had their goods taken from them for wor&s;hip|ping God. We took an account of what had been taken from them: and &s;ome friends met together about it, and drew up the ca&s;e of the &s;ufferings of our friends in writing, and gave it to the ju&s;tices at their petty &s;e&s;&s;ions. Where|upon they made an order, <Q>That the officers &s;hould not &s;ell the goods of friends which they had in their hands, but keep them till the next &s;e&s;&s;ions;</Q> which gave &s;ome di&s;|couragement to the informers, and put a little &s;top to their proceedings.</P>
<P>The next fir&s;t-day it was upon me to go to the meeting at the Savoy; and by that time it was gathered, the beadle came in; and after him the wild people, like a &s;ea, but the Lord's power chained them all. The Spirit of the Lord went through and over all, and they were quiet, and we had a glorious, peaceable meeting; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for his un&s;peakable goodne&s;s! This was in the twelfth month 1682.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t month 1683 I went to King&s;ton upon Thames. As I went to the meeting, I met the chief con|&s;table who had been at the meeting-place, and had &s;et watchmen to keep us out; yet he was pretty civil, and the watchmen let friends have a couple of forms out, to &s;it upon in the highway: &s;o friends met together there, and a very precious meeting we had; for the refre&s;hing pre&s;ence of the Lord was with us, in which we parted in peace.</P>
<P>Having vi&s;ited and encouraged friends there, I returned to London, and went to the meeting at Bull and Mouth, where the con&s;tables with their watchmen kept a guard, to keep friends out of the hou&s;e. So we met in the &s;treet; and when any friend &s;poke, the officers and watchmen made a great bu&s;tle to pull him down, and take him into cu&s;tody. After &s;ome other friends had &s;poken, it was upon me to &s;peak. I &s;aid, <Q>Heaven is God's throne, and earth is his foot&s;tool: and will ye not let us &s;tand upon God's foot|&s;tool to wor&s;hip and &s;erve the living God?</Q> While I &s;poke, they were quiet: and after I had cleared my&s;elf, we broke up our meeting in peace. This was on the &s;ixth day of the week.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t-day following I was moved to go to the
<PB N="308" REF="037441_0824_100D93DB33624048">meeting at Gracechurch-&s;treet. When I came there, I found a guard &s;et at the entrance in Lombard-&s;treet, and another at the gate in Gracechurch-&s;treet, to keep friends out of the meeting-place; &s;o we were fain to meet in the &s;treet. After &s;ome time I got a chair, &s;tood up in it, and &s;poke largely to the people, <Q>Opening the principles of truth to them, and declaring many weighty truths con|cerning magi&s;tracy, and the Lord's prayer.</Q> There was, be&s;ides friends, a great multitude of people, and all was very quiet; for the Lord's power was over all, and in his time we broke up our meeting, and departed in peace.</P>
<P>Next day I went to Guildford in Surry; and having vi|&s;ited friends there, pa&s;&s;ed to Worminghur&s;t in Su&s;&s;ex, where I had a very ble&s;&s;ed meeting among friends, free from di&s;|turbance. While I was there, James Claypole of London (who with his wife was there al&s;o) was &s;uddenly taken very ill with &s;o violent a fit of the &s;tone, that he could neither &s;tand nor lie; but through the extremity of pain cried out like a woman in travail. When I heard it, I was much exerci&s;ed in &s;pirit for him, and went to him. After I had &s;poken a few words to him, to turn his mind inward, I was moved to lay my hand upon him, and prayed the Lord to rebuke his infirmity. As I laid my hand on him, the Lord's power went through him; and by &s;aith in that power he had &s;peedy ea&s;e, &s;o that he quickly fell into a &s;leep. When he awaked, the &s;tone came from him like dirt; and he was &s;o well, that the next day he rode with me five-and-twenty miles in a coach, though he u&s;ed formerly (as he &s;aid) to lie &s;ometimes two weeks, &s;ometimes a month, with one of tho&s;e fits of the &s;tone. But the Lord was intreated for him, and by his power &s;oon gave him ea&s;e at this time: ble&s;&s;ed and prai&s;ed be his holy name therefore!</P>
<P>After I had had &s;ome meetings in Su&s;&s;ex and Surry, and vi&s;ited friends thereaway, I returned to London by King&s;|ton, where I had a meeting on the fir&s;t day of the &s;econd month, being fir&s;t-day. We were kept out of the meeting|hou&s;e by a con&s;table and watchmen, &s;o were fain to meet in the highway. But it being the monthly meeting day, and many people being there, the meeting was pretty large, and very quiet; and the Lord's ble&s;&s;ed pre&s;ence was among&s;t us; ble&s;&s;ed be his name for ever!</P>
<P>Being come to London, I went to the meeting at Wheel|er-&s;treet near Spital&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lds, which that day proved very large, and a gloricus, ble&s;&s;ed meeting it was: for the Lord's power
<PB N="309" REF="037441_0825_100D93DEE87A9450">and truth was over all, and many deep and weighty things were opened to the people to their great &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I tarried in and near London, vi&s;iting meetings, and la|bouring in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel, till the yearly meeting came on, which began the 28th of the third month. It was a time of great &s;ufferings; and much concerned I was, le&s;t friends, that came up out of the country on the church's &s;er|vice, &s;hould be taken and impri&s;oned at London. But the Lord was with us, his power pre&s;erved us; and gave us a &s;weet and ble&s;&s;ed opportunity to wait upon him, and be refre&s;hed together in him, and to perform tho&s;e &s;ervices for his truth and people, for which we met. As it was a time of great per&s;ecution, and we under&s;tood that in mo&s;t counties friends were under great &s;ufferings either by impri|&s;onments or &s;poiling of goods, or both, a concern was weigh|tily upon me, le&s;t any friends, e&s;pecially traders and dealers in the world, &s;hould hazard the lo&s;ing of other men's goods or e&s;tates through their &s;ufferings. Wherefore, as the thing opened in me, I drew an epi&s;tle of caution to friends in that ca&s;e, which I communicated to the yearly meeting; and from thence it was &s;ent among friends throughout the na|tion; a copy of which here followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends and brethren in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHO is your only &s;anctuary in this day of &s;torm andper&s;ecution, &s;poiling of goods and impri&s;onments! Let every one's eye be unto him, who has all power in heaven and earth given unto him; &s;o that none can touch an hair of your head, nor you, nor any thing ye have, ex|cept it be permitted or &s;uffered in this day to try his peo|ple, whether their minds be with the Lord or in outward things. Dear friends, take care that all your offerings be free, and of your own, that has co&s;t you &s;omething; &s;o that ye may not offer of that which is another man's, or that which ye are intru&s;ted withal (and not your own) or fatherle&s;s or widows e&s;tates; but all &s;uch things &s;ettle and e&s;tabli&s;h in their places. You may remember many years ago, in a time of great per&s;ecution, divers friends, who were traders, &s;hop-keepers, and others, had the concerns of widows and fatherle&s;s, and other people's e&s;tates in their hands. And when a great &s;uffering, per&s;ecution, and &s;poiling of goods came upon friends, e&s;pecial care was taken that all might offer up to the Lord in their &s;ufferings what was really their own, and not any other people's e&s;|tates
<PB N="310" REF="037441_0826_100D93E091EFACC0">or goods which they had in their hands; and that they might not offer up another body's, but that which they had bought and paid for, or were able to pay for. After|wards &s;everal letters came out of the country to the meet|ing at London, from friends that had goods of the &s;hop|keepers at London upon credit, which they had not paid for; who wrote to their creditors, intreating them to take their goods again. And &s;ome friends came to London them&s;elves, and treated with their creditors, letting them under&s;tand <Q>they lay liable to have all they had taken from them;</Q> and told them, <Q>they would not have any man to &s;uffer by them; neither would they by &s;uffering offer up any thing but what was really their own, or what they were able to pay for.</Q> Upon which &s;everal took their goods again. This wrought a very good favour in the hearts of many people, when they &s;aw &s;uch a right|eous, ju&s;t, and hone&s;t principle in friends, that would not make any &s;uffer for their te&s;timony; but what they did &s;uffer for the te&s;timony of Je&s;us &s;hould be really and truly their own, not other people's. In this they owed nothing to any but love. So in this every man and wo|man &s;tands in the free offering, a free people, whether it be &s;piritual or temporal which is their own; and in that they wrong no man, neither inwardly nor outwardly. Or|nan &s;aid unto David, <Q>I give thee the thre&s;hing-floor, &amp;c. and the oxen for burnt-offerings: and the thre&s;hing-in&s;truments for wood, and the wheat for the meat-offering, I give it all.</Q> But king David &s;aid unto Ornan, <Q>nay, but I will verily buy it for the full price; for I will not take that which is thine for the Lord, nor offer burnt-offerings without co&s;t,</Q> 1 Chron. xxi. 22, &amp;c. So it &s;hould be his own, and &s;o &s;hould it be every man's that offers. You may &s;ee here, that David would not accept of another man's gift for an offering to the Lord; he would not offer up that which co&s;t him nothing, but what &s;hould be really his own, P&s;al. cxii. 5. <Q>A good man&mdash; will guide his affairs with di&s;cretionf.</Q></P>

Some time after the yearly meeting I went to King&s;ton upon Thames to vi&s;it friends; and while I was there, it came upon me to write the following epi&s;tle to friends in general, as a &s;alutation of love, and to &s;tir up the pure mind in them.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends and brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHO are turned from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan to God, who are believers in the light, which is the life in Chri&s;t, and are become children of the light and of the day, grafted into Chri&s;t, the &s;e|cond Adam, the Lord from heaven, and are gathered in the name of Je&s;us, in whom ye have &s;alvation, and not in any other name under the whole heaven. For Chri&s;t Je|&s;us &s;aith, <Q>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them,</Q> Matth. xviii. 20. So you being gathered in the name of Je&s;us, he is in the mid&s;t of you, a Saviour, a Mediator, a Pro|phet, a Shepherd, a Bi&s;hop, a Leader, a Coun&s;ellor, the Captain of your Salvation, who brui&s;es the Serpent's head, and de&s;troys the devil and his works. Therefore, bre|thren in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day, le&s;t any of you be hardened through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in. For you are made partakers of Chri&s;t, if ye hold fa&s;t the beginning of your confidence &s;teadfa&s;t to the end, Hebr. iii. 14. Therefore hear Chri&s;t's voice; for he is in the mid&s;t of you a teacher. Take heed le&s;t there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in depart|ing from the living God, as there is in too many in this day of provocation and temptation. While it is to-day hear his voice, and let us con&s;ider one another, to provoke unto love and to good works. Let us hold fa&s;t the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of our faith without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promi&s;ed, and hath called you) not for&s;aking the a&s;&s;embling of our&s;elves together, as the manner of &s;ome is: mark, "as the manner of &s;ome is," that did and do for|&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of them&s;elves together; but exhorting one another, and &s;o much the more as you &s;ee the day of light appearing. For if we &s;in wilfully after we have re|ceived the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more &s;acrifice for &s;ins, but a certain fearful looking for of judg|ment and fiery indignation, which &s;hall devour the adver|&s;aries, Hebr. x. Therefore it is good not to for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of our&s;elves together, but exhort one another
<PB N="312" REF="037441_0828_100D9493416479D0">daily; for Chri&s;t is in the mid&s;t of his people a teacher and a prophet, who &s;aith, <Q>Learn of me, the way, the truth, and the life.</Q> We being many are one body in Chri&s;t, gathered in his name, and every one members one of another. Having then gifts, differing according to the grace that is given us, whether they be prophecy, let us prophe&s;y according to the proportion of faith; and let tho&s;e that mini&s;ter wait on their mini&s;try; tho&s;e that be teachers on their teaching; and he that exhorteth on ex|hortation; he that gives, let him do it with &s;implicity; and he that ruleth, with diligence; and he that &s;heweth mercy is to do it with cheerfulne&s;s. Abhor that which evil, cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one towards another, with brotherly love, in honour pre|ferring one another. Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribu|lations, <Q>be not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good;</Q> and, if it be po&s;&s;ible, as much as lieth in you, "live peaceably with all men;" Rom. xii. This is and was the practice of the church of Chri&s;t. And now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believ|ing, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Gho&s;t. I my&s;elf al&s;o am per&s;uaded of you, my brethren, that ye al&s;o are full of goodne&s;s, filled with all knowledge, and are able al&s;o to admoni&s;h one another, Rom. xv. 13, 14. Here the church of Chri&s;t, in which he was in the mid&s;t, a teacher and the head of the church, were and are able through him to admoni&s;h one another. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which ye are al&s;o called into one body, to wit, of Chri&s;t. Let the word of Chri&s;t dwell in you richly in all wi&s;dom. teaching and admoni&s;hing one another, &amp;c. Col. iii. <Q>What&s;oever ye do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, giving thanks to God and the Father by him;</Q> and above all things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectne&s;s. The apo&s;tle &s;aith to Timothy, <Q>Be not thou a&s;hamed of the te&s;timony of our Lord, nor of me his pri|&s;oner; but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the go&s;|pel, according to the power of God, who hath &s;aved us, and called us with an holy calling; not according to our works, but according to his own purpo&s;e and grace, which was given us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us before the world began,</Q> 2 Tim. i. 8, 9. It concerns every one not to be a&s;hamed of the te&s;timony of our Lord, who hath called them by his grace; and not to be a&s;hamed of any of Chri&s;t's pri|&s;oners,
<PB N="313" REF="037441_0829_100D7FA8D3FA6140">and afflicted ones for Chri&s;t's and his go&s;pel's &s;ake, who aboli&s;hes death, and brings life and immortality to light through his go&s;pel; you that believe in the light, know it. Peter &s;aith in his general epi&s;tle to the church of Chri&s;t, "As every man," mark every man, <Q>hath re|ceived the gift, &s;o mini&s;ter the &s;ame one to another, as good &s;tewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man &s;peak, let him &s;peak as the oracles of God,</Q> &s;o not of men. <Q>If any man mini&s;ter let him do it as of the ability which God gives,</Q> &s;o not of the ability of men's arts and &s;cien|ces, <Q>that God in all things may be glorified through Je|&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q> &amp;c. For the&s;e gifts and grace come from Je|&s;us into the hearts of the members of his church, whom he is in the mid&s;t of. And if any man &s;uffer as a Chri&s;tian, let him not be a&s;hamed, but let him glorify God, &amp;c. Every true Chri&s;tian hath the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, who hath all power in heaven and in earth given him, to &s;up|port "them with his power, light, and life. Chri&s;t &s;aith "to his believers, <Q>Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will &s;courge you in the &s;ynagogues, and you &s;hall be brought before governors and kings for my name's &s;ake, for a te&s;timony again&s;t them and the Gentiles. But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye &s;hall &s;peak; for it &s;hall be given you in the &s;ame hour what ye &s;hall &s;peak: for it is not you that &s;peak, but the Spirit of your Father that &s;peaketh in you. And ye &s;hall be hated of all men for my name's &s;ake; but he that endureth to the end &s;hall be &s;aved. The di&s;ciple is not above his ma&s;ter, nor the &s;ervant above his lord; it is enough for the di&s;ciple that he be as his ma&s;ter, and the &s;ervant as his lord; for if they have called the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e Beelzebub, what will they do to his &s;ervant? Fear not them which kill the bo|dy, but are not able to kill the &s;oul, &amp;c. A &s;parrow &s;hall not fall to the ground without your heavenly Father, &amp;c. The hairs of your head are all numbered, ye are of more value than many &s;parrows. Who&s;oever therefore &s;hall confe&s;s me before men, him will I confe&s;s al&s;o before my Father which is in heaven; but who&s;oever &s;hall deny me before men, him will I al&s;o deny before my Father which is in heaven. And who&s;oever &s;hall be a&s;hamed of me and of my words, of him &s;hall the Son of Man be a&s;ham|ed,</Q> &amp;c. Matth. x. Again Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>Who&s;oever &s;hall be a&s;hamed of me and of my words in this adulte|rous
<PB N="314" REF="037441_0830_100D93DCCDA30B08">and &s;inful generation, of him al&s;o &s;hall the Son of Man be a&s;hamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with his holy angels,</Q> Mark viii. 38. And Chri&s;t &s;aith to his di&s;ciples, <Q>He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that &s;ent me; he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, &s;hall re|ceive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righte|ous man in the name of a righteous man, &s;hall receive a righteous man's reward. Who&s;oever &s;hall give to drink unto one of the&s;e little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a di&s;ciple, verily I &s;ay unto you he &s;hall in no wi&s;e lo&s;e his reward,</Q> Matth. x. 40, 41, 42. Here ye may &s;ee how Chri&s;t encourages his di&s;ciples, and them that receive them. And John &s;aith, <Q>Among the chief rulers of the Jews many believed in Chri&s;t; but becau&s;e of the Phari&s;ees they did not confe&s;s him, le&s;t they &s;hould be put out of the &s;ynagogue,</Q> John xii. 42. Too many &s;uch believers are now-a-days, who dare not confe&s;s Chri&s;t, le&s;t they &s;hould lo&s;e the favour of men. But Chri&s;t en|courages the faithful di&s;ciples, and told them, they would put them out of their &s;ynagogues; yea, that the time &s;hould come, that who&s;oever killed them would think they did God &s;ervice. "The&s;e things," &s;aid he, <Q>will they do unto you, becau&s;e they have not known the Fa|ther, nor me. But the&s;e things have I told you, that when the time &s;hall come ye may remember that I told you of them,</Q> John xvi. 2, 3, 4. Here ye may &s;ee what Chri&s;t told his Di&s;ciples &s;hould come to pa&s;s to them. And Saul, before he was converted, did compel the Chri&s;|tians to bla&s;pheme, and make havock of the Church of Chri&s;t, Acts viii. and chap. 22 and 26. Did not the bea&s;t in the Revelations compel both &s;mall and great to wor&s;hip him and his image? And did not all wor&s;hip it, but tho&s;e who had their names written in the Lamb's book of life? Did not Nebuchadnezzar &s;et up an image of &s;ixty cubits high, and &s;ix cubits broad? And did not he cau&s;e a herald to cry aloud, <Q>It is commanded that all people, and nations, and languages fall down and wor&s;hip the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar hath &s;et up; and who&s;o falleth not down and wor&s;hippeth &s;hall the &s;ame hour be ca&s;t into the mid&s;t of the &s;iery furnace?</Q> And were not Shadrach, Me&s;hach, and Abednego ca&s;t into the furnace? Dan. iii. But God delivered them. Therefore it is good to be faithful to God and his wor&s;hip in &s;pirit
<PB N="315" REF="037441_0831_100D93E58F2A04E0">and truth. The Jews agreed, that if any man &s;hould confe&s;s Chri&s;t he &s;hould be put out of their &s;ynagogue, John ix. 22. So it was for Chri&s;t's &s;ake they were ex|communicated out of their &s;ynagogues. But, as it is writ|ten, <Q>Behold I lay in Sion a &s;tumbling-&s;tone, and a rock of offence; and who&s;o believes on him &s;hall not be a&s;ha|med.</Q> So Chri&s;t is a &s;tumbling-&s;tone and a rock of of|fence to all the unbelievers in the light, which is the life in Chri&s;t, whether they be Jews, Chri&s;tians, or Gentiles. The Jews did believe Chri&s;t was to come, from the &s;crip|tures, and the Chri&s;tians believe he is come, by the &s;crip|tures, but do not believe in the light as Chri&s;t commands, and &s;o do not become children of the light. Therefore ye that are believers in the light, and are become the chil|dren of light, walk in Chri&s;t, your way, life, and &s;alvation.</P>

That ye may know the three that bear witne&s;s in the earth, the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, which is the Life of Chri&s;t, which clean&s;|eth from all &s;in; the Water that wa&s;hes and refre&s;hes you, the Spirit that baptizes, circumci&s;es, and leads you into all truth; that ye may come all to drink into one Spirit, and keep the unity of the Spirit, which is the bond of the heavenly peace. So being led by the Spirit of God, ye are his &s;ons and daughters, and by his Spirit will come to know the three that bear witne&s;s in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Gho&s;t. The&s;e are the three wit|ne&s;&s;es that are in heaven, that bear record of all things; for he is God in the heaven, and God in the earth. There|fore I de&s;ire that ye may all feel his love &s;hed in your hearts, and in it live (above the love of the world, which is enmity) and in that you will keep in the excellent way, For love edifies the body of Chri&s;t, builds his church up, and keeps out of the enmity; for it is above it, and brings and keeps all in true humanity, and in the true divinity; and to be courteous, kind, and tender one towards an|other. And &s;hew forth the nature of Chri&s;t, and true chri&s;tianity, in all your lives and conver&s;ations, that the ble&s;&s;ings of the Lord may re&s;t upon you, as ye all live in the &s;eed of the go&s;pel, the &s;eed of the kingdom of God, in which all nations are ble&s;&s;ed. In that ye will all have a care of God's glory. There is the hill or mountain where the light &s;hines to the an&s;wering the witne&s;s of God in all, and the &s;alt that is a good favour to the witne&s;s of God in the hearts of all; which favour and &s;alt being kept in, it doth not come under the feet of men. So my love to you all in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, whom God hath given to be a &s;anctuary for all his people, who is from above, and not of this world, in whom ye have life, peace, and &s;alva|tion. In him God Almighty keep and pre&s;erve you all to his glory, Amen. As you live in the peaceable truth of God, it keeps you under and within his protection; but they that make profe&s;&s;ion of the &s;criptures of truth, and yet live out of the truth, in the &s;pirit of &s;trife, un|quietne&s;s and di&s;content, in a contriving, plotting, rave|nous,

<P>Having vi&s;ited friends at and about King&s;ton I returned to London; for it being a &s;uffering time with friends there, I had not freedom to be long from the city. I went to the meeting at the Peel; which but a little before the ju&s;tices and con&s;tables had broken up, and had carried them&s;elves very roughly; but that day the meeting was in the hou&s;e, and quiet, and a glorious meeting it was, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t-day following I went to the meeting at Grace-church-&s;treet, where I found three con&s;tables in the meeting|hou&s;e, who kept friends out; &s;o we met in the court. After I had been &s;ome time in the meeting, I &s;tood up, and &s;poke to the people, and continued &s;peaking a pretty while. Then one of the con&s;tables came, took hold of my hand, and &s;aid, 'I mu&s;t come down.' I de&s;ired him to be patient, and went on &s;peaking to the people; but after a little time he plucked me down, and had me into the meeting-hou&s;e. I a&s;ked them, if they were not weary of this work? One of them &s;aid, 'Indeed they were.' They let me go into the widow Fo&s;ter's hou&s;e, which joined to the meeting-hou&s;e, where I &s;taid, being hot. When the meeting was ended, for one prayed after I was taken away, the con&s;tables a&s;ked &s;ome friends, <Q>Which of them would pa&s;s their words that I &s;hould appear, if they &s;hould be que&s;tioned about me?</Q> But the friends telling them, <Q>They need not require that, for I was a man well known in the city to be one that would neither fly nor &s;hrink;</Q> they came not to me, but went their way, and I heard no further of it. The &s;ame week I was at the meeting at the Savoy, which u&s;ed to be kept out and di&s;turbed; but that day it was within doors and peaceable, and a precious meeting it was. The fir&s;t-day after it was upon me to go to the meeting at We&s;tmin|&s;ter, where u&s;ed to be great di&s;turbances: but there al&s;o the meeting was within doors that day, and was very large. The Lord's power was over all, and kept all quiet and &s;till; for though many loo&s;e &s;pirits were there, yet they were
<PB N="318" REF="037441_0834_100D93ECB7E51118">bound down by the power and Spirit of the Lord, that they could not get up to make di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>About this time I was moved to write the following epi&s;tle:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHO have received the peaceable truth, let the fruits of its peaceablene&s;s, and of your quiet &s;pirit appear in all your meetings and in all your words and actions; for he that inhabits eternity dwells with an humble heart, and he gives grace to the humble, and re&s;i&s;teth the proud. Heaven is his throne, and the earth ye walk upon is his foot&s;tool: happy are ye that &s;ee and know him that is invi&s;ible. And now, friends, let all things be done in your meetings and otherwi&s;e, in love, with|out &s;trife, or vain-glory. For love fulfils the law, love overcomes and edifies the body of Chri&s;t. There is nei|ther &s;elf, nor envy in love, neither is it puffed up; but abides and bears all things. See that this love of God have the &s;way in you all, and over you all. Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven; ble&s;&s;ed are they that mourn, for they &s;hall be comforted. Ble&s;&s;ed are the meek, for they &s;hall inherit the earth. Ble&s;&s;ed are they that hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, for they &s;hall be filled. Ble&s;&s;ed are the merciful, for they &s;hall obtain mercy. Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in heart, for they &s;hall &s;ee God. Ble&s;&s;ed are the peace-makers, for they &s;hall be called the children of God. Ble&s;&s;ed are they that are per&s;ecuted for righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;ake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Ble&s;|&s;ed are ye when men &s;hall revile you and per&s;ecute you, and &s;hall &s;ay all manner of evil again&s;t you fal&s;ely for my &s;ake; rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven; for &s;o per&s;ecuted they the pro|phets that were before you.</Q> Now friends, here is a great deal in the&s;e words. All mu&s;t be in the&s;e &s;tates and con|ditions, if they have the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings. The children of God are peace-makers, and &s;trive to make peace in the truth; and to live in peace with all men, if it be po&s;&s;ible. So live in the peace and the good-will to all men; which good-will is both for their &s;anctification and &s;alvation. And friends, con&s;ider, the wi&s;dom of God, which is from above, is pure, peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hy|pocri&s;y.
<PB N="319" REF="037441_0835_100D93EE50A24148">Dear friends, let this pure, peaceable, gentle, wi&s;dom that is from above, that is ea&s;y to be intreated, and is full of mercy and good fruits, be exerci&s;ed and practi&s;ed in all the true churches of Chri&s;t; that wi&s;dom may be ju&s;tified of her children. For the works of the fle&s;h, or fle&s;hly &s;pirit, are hatred, variance, wrath, &s;trife, envyings, drunkenne&s;s, revellings, adultery, fornication, la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, uncleanne&s;s, &amp;c. and they which do &s;uch things, &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruits of the Spirit of God are love, joy, peace, long-&s;uf|fering, gentlene&s;s, goodne&s;s, faith, meekne&s;s, temperance, &amp;c. So, dear friends and brethren, &s;trive to exceed one another and all people upon the earth in humility, in meekne&s;s, in gentlene&s;s, in temperance, in love, in pa|tience, in purene&s;s, and in mercy; then ye will &s;hew forth the fruits of the Spirit of God, and of his heavenly wi&s;|dom that is from above. In this, wi&s;dom will be ju&s;tified of her children; and ye will be the &s;alt of the earth, and a light to the world &s;et on an hill, that cannot be hid: and your moderation will appear to all men. Be ye ju&s;t and righteous, faithful and true in all your words, dealings, and conver&s;ations; that ye may an&s;wer the truth in all people: for Chri&s;t &s;aith, his father is glorified by &s;uch as bring forth fruits, when men &s;ee their good works; for he that doth righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted with God. And he that dwells in love, dwells in God; for love is his habitation. Let that be the habitation of every one that hath received the truth: for if it be not, &s;uch do not dwell in God, let them profe&s;s what they will. Therefore my de&s;ire is, that all you, who have received Chri&s;t the &s;eed, which brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head, may walk in him your &s;anctuary, life, and &s;alvation, your re&s;t and peace, Amen.</P>

<P>I continued yet at London, labouring in the work and &s;ervice of the Lord both in and out of meetings; &s;ometimes vi&s;iting friends in pri&s;on for the te&s;timony of Je&s;us, encou|raging them in their &s;ufferings, and exhorting them to &s;tand faithful and &s;teadfa&s;t in the te&s;timony which the Lord had committed to them to bear: &s;ometimes al&s;o vi&s;iting tho&s;e that were &s;ick and weak in body, or troubled in mind, helping to bear their &s;pirits up from &s;inking under their in|firmities.
<PB N="320" REF="037441_0836_100D93F02DCAABE8">Sometimes our meetings were quiet and peacea|ble, &s;ometimes they were di&s;turbed and broken up by the officers. One fir&s;t-day it was upon me to go to the meet|ing at the Savoy, which was large: for many profe&s;&s;ors and &s;ober people were there. The Lord opened many precious weighty things in me to the people, which I declared among&s;t them, and <Q>directed them to the &s;pirit of God in them&s;elves, which the Lord had given them a mea&s;ure of; that all by the Spirit might under&s;tand the Scriptures, which were given forth from the Spirit of God; and that by the Spirit of God they might know God, and Chri&s;t whom God hath &s;ent, whom to know is eternal life; and that by the Spirit they might all come into Chri&s;t, and know him to be their &s;anctuary, who de&s;troys the devil, the de&s;troyer, and his works, and brui&s;es the &s;erpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s head. For Chri&s;t was a &s;anctuary to them to whom he was a Saviour, whom he &s;aved from the de&s;troyer. And Chri&s;t did baptize them with the Holy Gho&s;t and with fire, and did thoroughly purge his floor, and burn up their chaff with unquenchable fire; that is, &s;in and cor|ruption, which is got into man and woman by their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion: but Chri&s;t gathereth his wheat into his garner. So all that are baptized with Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m, their wheat is in God's garner; and no &s;poiler can get into God's gar|ner to meddle with the wheat there, though they may be permitted to meddle with the outward goods, &amp;c. As I was &s;peaking in the power of the Lord, and the people were greatly affected therewith, on a &s;udden the con&s;tables, with the rude people, came in like a &s;ea. One of the con&s;tables &s;aid, Come down,</Q> and laid hands on me. I a&s;ked him, 'Art thou a Chri&s;tian? We are chri&s;tians.' He had hold on my hand, and was very fierce to pluck me down; but I &s;tood &s;till, and &s;poke a few words to the people; de&s;ir|ing of the Lord, that the ble&s;&s;ings of God might re&s;t upon them all. The con&s;table &s;till called upon me to come down, and at length plucked me down, and bid another man with a &s;taff, 'Take and carry me to pri&s;on.' That man had me to another officer's hou&s;e, who was more ci|vil; and after awhile they brought in four friends more, whom they had taken. I was very weary, and in a great &s;weat; and &s;everal friends hearing where I was, came to me in the con&s;table's hou&s;e: but I bid them all go their ways, le&s;t the con&s;tables and informers &s;hould &s;top them. After awhile the con&s;tables had us almo&s;t a mile to a ju&s;|tice,
<PB N="321" REF="037441_0837_100D93F24EEDFDB0">who was a fierce, pa&s;&s;ionate man: who, after he had a&s;ked me my name, and his clerk had taken it in writing, upon the con&s;table's informing him, <Q>That I preached inthe meeting,</Q> &s;aid in an angry manner, <Q>Do not you know that it is contrary to the king's laws to preach in &s;uch conventicles, contrary to the liturgy of the church of England?</Q> There was pre&s;ent one Shad (a wicked inform|er, who was &s;aid to have broken gaol at Coventry, and to have been burnt in the hand at London) who hearing the ju&s;tice &s;peak &s;o to me, &s;tepped up to him, and told him, <Q>That he had convicted them on the act of the 22d of king Charles the Second.</Q> 'What! you convict them?' &s;aid the ju&s;tice. 'Yes,' &s;aid Shad, <Q>I have convicted them, and you mu&s;t convict them too upon that act.</Q> With that the ju&s;tice was angry with him, and &s;aid, <Q>You teach me! What are you? I'll convict them of a riot.</Q> The informer hearing that, and &s;eeing the ju&s;tice angry, went away in a fret; &s;o he was di&s;appointed of his purpo&s;e. I thought he would have &s;worn &s;omebody again&s;t me: where|upon I &s;aid, <Q>Let no man &s;wear again&s;t me, for it is my principle, Not to &s;wear;</Q> and therefore I would not 'have any man &s;wear again&s;t me.' The ju&s;tice there|upon a&s;ked me, 'If I did not preach in the meeting?' I told him. <Q>I did confe&s;s what God and Chri&s;t had done for my &s;oul; and did prai&s;e God. I thought I might have done that in the &s;treets, and in all places, viz. prai&s;e God, and confe&s;s Chri&s;t Je&s;us; which I was not a&s;hamed to con|&s;e&s;s. Neither was this contrary to the liturgy of the church of England.</Q> The ju&s;tice &s;aid, <Q>The laws were again&s;t &s;uch meetings as were contrary to the liturgy of the church of England.</Q> I &s;aid. <Q>I knew no &s;uch laws again&s;t our meetings; but if he did mean that act that was made again&s;t &s;uch as did meet to plot, contrive, and rai&s;e in|&s;urrections again&s;t the king, we were no &s;uch people, but did abhor all &s;uch actions; and did bear true love and good-will to the king, and to all men upon the earth.</Q> The ju&s;tice then a&s;ked me, 'If I had been in orders?' I told him. No. Then he took his law-books, and &s;earched for laws again&s;t us, bidding his clerk take the names of the re&s;t the mean time. But when he could find no other law again&s;t us, the clerk &s;wore the con&s;table again&s;t us. Some of the friends bid the con&s;table <Q>take heed what he &s;wore, le&s;t he were perjured; for he, took them in the entry, and not in the meeting.</Q> Yet the con&s;table, being an ill man,
<PB N="322" REF="037441_0838_100D93F723CDCD50">&s;wore, 'That they were in the meeting.' However, the ju&s;tice &s;aid, <Q>Seeing there was but one witne&s;s, he would di&s;charge the re&s;t; but he would &s;end me to Newgate, and I might preach there.</Q> I a&s;ked him, <Q>If it &s;tood with his con&s;cience to &s;end me to Newgate for prai&s;ing God, and for confe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;t Je&s;us?</Q> He cried, <Q>Con|&s;cience! con&s;cience!</Q> but I felt my words touched his <Q>con&s;cience. He bid the con&s;table take me away, and he would make a mitrimus to &s;end me to pri&s;on when he had dined.</Q> I told him, <Q>I de&s;ired his peace, and the good of his family; and that they might be kept in the fear of the Lord.</Q> So I pa&s;&s;ed away, and as I went the con&s;table took &s;ome friends word that I &s;hould come to his hou&s;e the next morning by the eighth hour. Accordingly I did go with tho&s;e friends, and the con&s;table told us he went to the ju&s;tice for the mittimus after he had dined; and the ju&s;tice bid him, 'Come again after the evening &s;ervice;' which he did; and then the ju&s;tice told him, <Q>He might let me go.</Q> So, &s;aid the con&s;table, you are di&s;charged. I blamed him for turning informer, and &s;wearing again&s;t us. He &s;aid, 'He would do &s;o no more.' Next day, the ju&s;|tice meeting with Gilbert Laty, a&s;ked him. <Q>If he would pay twenty pounds for George Fox's fine?</Q> He &s;aid, 'No.' 'Then.' &s;aid the ju&s;tice, <Q>I am di&s;appointed; for, being but a lodger, I cannot come by his fine; and he having been brought before me, and being of ability him|&s;elf, I cannot lay his fine on any other.</Q></P>
<P>After I was di&s;charged, I went into the city. The &s;ame week the &s;e&s;&s;ions coming on, where many friends were con|cerned, &s;ome as pri&s;oners, and &s;ome on trials of appeals upon the conventicle act, I went to a friend's hou&s;e not far off, that I might be in readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e friends with coun&s;el, or otherwi&s;e, as occa&s;ion &s;hould offer; and I found &s;ervice in it.

Many &s;ince the day of Chri&s;t, and the truth hath appear|ed in this nation, have had &s;ome openings and &s;ights, and come among us for a time, and then gone from us again; who have been the comers and goers, like tho&s;e in the apo&s;tles days. Such had an outward profe&s;&s;ion of the truth, and have gone from the true feundation Chri&s;t Je|&s;us, and &s;o from the heavenly &s;ociety and unity of the faints in light. Then they &s;et up foundations of their own, and having a form of godline&s;s, but out of the power there|of, out of the order thereof, &s;uch have turned to janglings and vain di&s;putings. This &s;pirit you have been acquaint|ed with, who have kept your habitations in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Fir&s;t and the La&s;t. And you are not in&s;en&s;ible of the &s;currilous and filthy books of lies and defamations which have been &s;pread abroad in this nation and beyond &s;ea again&s;t the faithful. It is very well that the Lord hath &s;uffered them to publi&s;h their own &s;hame in print, that truth's enemies may be di&s;covered; their fruits and &s;pirits have appeared, and manife&s;ted them&s;elves both in print and otherwi&s;e. And I believe the Lord will yet &s;uffer this &s;pirit &s;o to publi&s;h its &s;ruits, its &s;hame and nakedne&s;s, to profe&s;&s;or and profane, and to all &s;ober, moderate and innocent people, that its &s;hame and nakedne&s;s may more fully appear. Though for a time it hath been hid and covered with the &s;ig-leaves of an outward profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;ometimes with fawning and &s;lattering words (as at other times it hath di&s;covered it&s;elf by rough, lying, and defam|ing words) vet the Lord God will bla&s;t all &s;uch vain talkers, that do not walk in the order of life, truth, and the go&s;pel. Therefore, ye that are &s;aithful, &s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made you free in his go|vemment. It is upon his &s;houlders: he bears it up: of

<P>Read this in your a&s;&s;emblies among&s;t the faithful.</P>
<P>I tarried a little in London, vi&s;iting friends and meetings, and labouring in the work of the Lord. And being on a fir&s;t-day at the Bull and Mouth, where the meeting had long been kept without, it was that day in the hou&s;e, peace|able and large: the people were &s;o affected with the truth, and refre&s;hed with the powerful pre&s;ence of the Lord, that when the meeting ended, they were loth to go away.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, having &s;everal things upon me to write, I went to King&s;ton, that I might be free from interruptions. When I came there, I under&s;tood the officers had been very rude at the meeting, abu&s;ing friends, and had driven them out of the meeting-place, and very abu&s;ive they continued to be for &s;ome time. Whil&s;t I was there I wrote a little book (printed &s;oon after) the title whereof was: <Q>The &s;aints heavenly and &s;piritual wor&s;hip, unity, and communion, &amp;c. wherein is &s;et forth what the true go&s;pel-wor&s;hip is, and in what the true unity and communion of the &s;aints &s;tands;

<P>When I had fini&s;hed the &s;ervices for which I went thi|ther, and had vi&s;ited the friends, I returned to London, and vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings in and about the city. After|wards I went to vi&s;it a friend in E&s;&s;ex; and returning by Dal&s;ton, I made &s;ome &s;tay at the widow Stot's, where I wrote an epi&s;tle to friends, which may be read among&s;t my other printed books.</P>
<P>I came from Dal&s;ton to London, and the next day was &s;ent for in ha&s;te to my &s;on Rou&s;e's at King&s;ton; who&s;e daughter Margaret lay very &s;ick, and had a de&s;ire to &s;ee me. I tarried at King&s;ton about a week, and then returned to London; where I continued mo&s;t part of the winter and the &s;pring following, until the general meeting in 1684 (&s;ave that I went once as far as Enfield, to vi&s;it friends there|abouts.) In this time I cea&s;ed not to labour in the work of the Lord, being frequent at meetings, and vi&s;iting friends that were pri&s;oners. or that were &s;ick, and in writing books for the &s;preading of truth, and opening the under&s;tandings of people to receive it.</P>
<P>The yearly meeting was in the third month. A ble&s;&s;ed, weighty meeting it was, wherein friends were &s;weetly re|fre&s;hed together; for the Lord was with us, and opened his heavenly trea&s;ures among&s;t us. And though it was a time of great difficulty and danger, by rea&s;on of informers and per&s;ecuting magi&s;trates, yet the Lord was a defence and place of &s;afety to his people.</P>
<P>Now I had drawings in Spirit to go into Holland, to vi&s;it the &s;eed of God in tho&s;e provinces. And as &s;oon as the yearly meeting was over, I prepared for my journey. There went with me from London Alexander Parker. George Watts, and Nathaniel Bra&s;&s;ey, who al&s;o had draw|ings into that country. We took coach the 31&s;t of the third month 1684, and got to Colche&s;ter that night. Next day, being fir&s;t-day, we went to the meeting there; and though there was no notice given of my coming, our being there was pre&s;ently &s;pread over the town, and in &s;everal places in the country, at &s;even and ten miles di&s;tance; &s;o that abun|dance of friends came in double-hor&s;ed, which made the meeting very large. I had a concern and travail in my mind, le&s;t this great gathering &s;hould have &s;tirred up the town, and been more than the magi&s;trates could well bear;
<PB N="327" REF="037441_0843_100D940245577650">but it was very quiet and peaceable, and a glorious meeting we had, to the &s;ettling and &s;tabli&s;hing of friends both in the town and country: for the Lord's power was over all; ble&s;&s;ed be his name for ever! Truly, the Lord's power and pre&s;ence was beyond words; for I was but weak to go into a meeting, and my face (by rea&s;on of a cold) was &s;ore: but God manife&s;ted his &s;trength in us and with us, and all was well; the Lord have the glory for evermore for his &s;upport|ing power. After the meeting came, I think, above an hun|dred friends of the town and country to &s;ee me at John Furley's. Very glad we were to &s;ee one another, and great|ly refre&s;hed we were together, being filled with the love and riches of the Lord; ble&s;&s;ed be his name for ever!</P>
<P>We tarried at Colche&s;ter two days more; which we &s;pent in vi&s;iting friends, both at their meetings for bu&s;ine&s;s, and at their hou&s;es. Early in the morning on fourth-day we took coach for Harwich, where we met William Bingley and Samuel Waldenfield, who went over with us. About the eighth hour at night we went on board the paquet-boat, Richard Gray, ma&s;ter; but by rea&s;on of contrary winds it was the fir&s;t hour in the morning before we &s;ailed. We had a very good pa&s;&s;age; and about the fifth hour in the afternoon next day we landed at the Brill in Holland, where we &s;taid that night. Early next morning we went to Rotterdam, where we abode &s;ome days. The next day after we came to Rotterdam, one Wilbert Frouzen, a burgo|ma&s;ter, and kin&s;man of Aarent Sunneman's, hearing I was there, invited me to his country-hou&s;e, having a de&s;ire to &s;peak with me about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s relating to Aarent Sun|neman's daughters. I took George Watts with me, and a brother of Aarent Sunneman's had us thither. The burgo|ma&s;ter received us very kindly, was glad to &s;ee me, and entering into di&s;cour&s;e about his kin&s;man's daughters, I found he was apprehen&s;ive that, their father being dead, and having left them con&s;iderable portions, they might be &s;tolen, and married to their di&s;advantage. Wherefore I told him, <Q>It was our principle and practice, that none &s;hould marry among&s;t us, unle&s;s they had a certificate of the con&s;ent of their relations or guardians; for it was our Chri&s;tian care to watch over and look after all young people that came among us, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who&s;e relations were dead. And as for his kin&s;iman's daughters, we &s;hould take care that nothing &s;hould be offered to them but what &s;hould be agreeable to truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and that they
<PB N="328" REF="037441_0844_100D940490C5CED8">might be pre&s;erved in the fear of God, according to their father's mind.</Q> This &s;eemed to give him great &s;atisfaction. While I was with him, there came many great people to me; and <Q>I exhorted them all to keep in the feat of God, and to mind his good Spirit in them, to keep their minds to the Lord.</Q> After I had &s;taid two or three hours, and di&s;cour&s;ed with them of &s;everal things, I took my leave, and he very kindly &s;ent me to Rotterdam in his chariot.</P>
<P>Next day, being fir&s;t-day, we were at the meeting at Rotterdam, which was pretty large, and declared to the people by an interpreter. The day following alderman Gaul came to &s;peak with me, with whom we had much di&s;cour&s;e about religious matters; wherewith he &s;eemed to be well &s;atisfied, and was very tender. Several other per|&s;ons of account intended to have come to &s;peak with me, but being hindered by extraordinary bu&s;ine&s;s (as I under|&s;tood) they came not.</P>
<P>We went next day from Rotterdam to Am&s;terdam, where we had a large and very precious meeting. In the after|noon I was at another meeting with friends there, about bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>There is a yearly meeting at Am&s;terdam for the friends of Holland and Germany, &amp;c. which begun now the eighth of the fourth month, and ended the twelfth. Here we had a fine opportunity of &s;eeing friends from divers parts, and of being refre&s;hed together in the love of God. After this meeting, before tho&s;e that came out of the &s;everal provinces were gone, we had a meeting with &s;ome particular friends, about the places and countries into which we, who came out of England in the work of the mini&s;try, were to travel; and to inquire who among them were &s;uitable per&s;ons to go along with us as interpreters. This concluded on, William Bingley and Samuel Waldenfield took &s;hipping for Frie&s;|land, with Jacob Claus their interpreter.</P>
<P>Alexander Parker and George Watts remained with me. We tarried a few days longer at Am&s;terdam, where I had further &s;ervice. Before I left Am&s;terdam. I went to vi&s;it Galenus Abrahams, a teacher of chief note among the Men|nonites, or Bapti&s;ts. I had been with him when I was in Holland about &s;even years before; and William Penn and George Keith had di&s;putes with him. He was then very high and very &s;hy, &s;o that he would not let me touch him, nor look upon him (by his good-will) but bid me "Keep my eyes off him; for," he &s;aid, "they pierced him." But
<PB N="329" REF="037441_0845_100D9406C8A0B1C8">now he was very loving and tender, and confe&s;&s;ed in &s;ome mea&s;ure to truth: his wife al&s;o and daughter were tender and kind, and we parted from them very lovingly. Feeling our &s;pirits drawn toward Frie&s;land, Alexander Parker, George Watts, and I, having John Claus of Am&s;terdam with us for our interpreter, took &s;hipping at Am&s;terdam for Frie&s;land, and having &s;ailed nine or ten leagues, we left the &s;hip and travelled through Frie&s;land, vi&s;iting friends and tender people in the towns and villages, having commonly one, &s;ometimes two meetings in a day. After we had been at Leuwarden, we pa&s;&s;ed by Franeker to Harlingen in We&s;t-Frie&s;land, which was the furthe&s;t place we went to that way. And having been out &s;ix days from Am&s;terdam, and had very good &s;ervice in that time, in vi&s;iting friends and pub|li&s;hing truth among&s;t the people, we took &s;hip at Harlingen for Am&s;terdam the 26th of the fourth month, and arrived there that night. The fir&s;t-day following we were at the meeting at Am&s;terdam, which was very large and precious. Many of the people were there, and &s;ome of their teachers, &s;ome great per&s;ons al&s;o. They &s;eemed very attentive, and a good opportunity we all had, one after another, to de|clare the word of the Lord and open the way of truth among&s;t them, John Claus interpreting for us. I tarried the next day at Am&s;terdam; but George Watts went to a burial at Harlem, where many hundreds of people were; among&s;t whom he had a good opportunity and came back at night to us.</P>
<P>The day following we went by boat to O&s;anoverton in Wa|terland, and from thence in another &s;mall boat about a league over a &s;mall river, where we pa&s;&s;ed over and by an hundred bridges, and &s;o to Lan&s;meer to a friend's, who&s;e name was Timon Peters; where we had a very good meeting. We returned to Am&s;terdam at night, and were at the meeting there next day. Many were at this meeting be&s;ides friends, among the re&s;t the great Bapti&s;t-teacher Galenus, who was very attentive to the te&s;timony of the truth, and when the meeting was done came and got me by the hand very lov|ingly.</P>
<P>We went next day by boat to Alkmaer, about eight leagues from Am&s;terdam, pa&s;&s;ing through Sardam, the great town of &s;hip-carpenters, and &s;everal other towns in the way. At Alkmaer, which is a pretty city, we &s;taid and had a meeting next day at William Williams's. There were, be|&s;ides friends, many very &s;ober people at this meeting, who
<PB N="330" REF="037441_0846_100D940A17127A98">were very attentive to the te&s;timonies of truth that were borne by Alexander Parker, George Watts, and my&s;elf, John Claus being our interpreter. This was on a &s;ixth-day, and on the &s;eventh we returned to Am&s;terdam, being willing to be at the meeting on fir&s;t-day, becau&s;e it was like to be the la&s;t meeting we &s;hould have there. Accordingly we were at it, and a very large and open meeting it was. Many great per&s;ons were pre&s;ent, &s;ome earls, we were told, with their attendants, out of Germany, who were very grave and &s;ober; and the everla&s;ting go&s;pel was preached unto them.</P>
<P>After this meeting we took leave of the friends of Am|&s;terdam, and next morning departed to Harlem, where we had a meeting at a friend's, who&s;e name is Abraham Fron|denberg. Great numbers of people were at this meeting, and of great &s;ervice it was. After the meeting, a watch|maker of Am&s;terdam, who with his wife was at the meet|ing, de&s;ired to &s;peak with me concerning religion. I had pretty much di&s;cour&s;e with him, and both he and &s;he were very low and tender, received with gladne&s;s what I &s;poke to them, and &s;eemed to depart well &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>We went next day to Rotterdam, where we tarried two meetings, and the &s;ixteenth of the fifth month went to the Brill, to take &s;hip for England.</P>
<P>About four in the afternoon, we went on board the pack|et-boat, William Sherman, ma&s;ter, and &s;et &s;ail from the Brill. When we had gone over the Ma&s;e about a league, we ca&s;t anchor at a place called the Pit, becau&s;e it is near the &s;ands, where we tarried till about four next morning; when having a pretty fair wind, and the tide with us, we weighed anchor, and by four next day were within five leagues of Harwich, over again&s;t Alborough ca&s;tle; but the wind falling &s;hort, and the tide being weak, it was the fir&s;t hour in the afternoon before we came &s;o near Harwich that boats could come to receive the pa&s;&s;engers and goods. There were on board about forty pa&s;&s;engers in all, of which &s;ome were Engli&s;h, &s;ome Scots, &s;ome Dutch, &s;ome French, &s;ome Spani&s;h, &s;ome Flemi&s;h, and &s;ome Jews.</P>
<P>I &s;pent a day with friends at Harwich, while Alexander Parker and George Watts went to vi&s;it friends at Ip&s;wich, and returned at night. Next morning early we all took coach for Colche&s;ter, and were at the meeting there, which was large and peaceable; after the meeting we travelled to Witham and lodged there that night. Next day, William
<PB N="331" REF="037441_0847_100D940BA75AA948">Mead meeting us on the way at Hare&s;treet, I went with him to his hou&s;e, and the other friends went for London.</P>
<P>Here, being weak with travel and continual exerci&s;e, I &s;pent &s;ome time to re&s;t my&s;elf and recover my health; vi&s;iting in the meantime friends in that part of the country as I was able to get abroad. When I was a little recovered I went to Enfield, vi&s;iting friends there and thereabouts, &s;o to Dal|&s;ton to &s;ee the widow Stot, and from thence to London; &s;ome friends being come over from New-Jer&s;ey in America about bu&s;ine&s;s which I was de&s;ired to be pre&s;ent at.</P>
<P>It was the latter end of the &s;ummer when I came to Lon|don, where I &s;taid the winter following; &s;ave once or twice, my wife being in town with me, I went with her to her &s;on Rou&s;e's at King&s;ton. And though my body was very weak, yet I was in continual &s;ervice either in publick meetings, when I was able to bear them, or in particular bu&s;ine&s;&s;es among friends, and vi&s;iting tho&s;e that were &s;uffer|ers for truth, either by impri&s;onment or lo&s;s of goods. Many things al&s;o in this time I wrote, &s;ome for the pre&s;s and &s;ome for particular &s;ervice; as letters to the king of Denmark, and one to the duke of Hol&s;tein, on behalf of friends that were &s;ufferers in his dominions; whereof the fol|lowing is a copy:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>For the duke of Hol&s;tein;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Whom I do intreat in the love of God to read over this which is &s;ent in love to him.</P>
<P>I UNDERSTAND that formerly, by &s;ome evil-minded per&s;ons, it was reported to thee, when Elizabeth Hen|dricks came to Frederick&s;tadt to vi&s;it the people called Quakers, <Q>that it was a &s;candal to the chri&s;tian religion that a woman &s;hould be &s;uffered to preach in a publick a&s;&s;embly religiou&s;ly gathered together,</Q> &amp;c. Upon which thou gave&s;t forth an order to the rulers of Frede|rick&s;tadt, <Q>to make the &s;aid people leave that place forth|with, or to &s;end them away.</Q> But the &s;aid Rulers being Arminians, and they or their fathers being come to live there as a people per&s;ecuted in Holland, not much above three&s;core years ago, made an&s;wer to the duke, <Q>they were not willing to per&s;ecute others for con&s;cience-&s;ake, who had looked upon per&s;ecution on that account in their own ca&s;e as antichri&s;tian,</Q> &amp;c. But after that, the peo|ple
<PB N="332" REF="037441_0848_100D940E283FAA48">of God, in &s;corn called Quakers, did write to thee, from Frederick&s;tadt; and &s;ince that time they have had their liberty, and their meetings peaceable, to &s;erve and wor&s;hip God almo&s;t the&s;e twenty years at Frederick&s;tadt and thereabouts, freely without mole&s;tation; which liberty they have acknowledged as a great favour and kindne&s;s from thee.</P>
<P>And now, O duke, thou profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tianity from the great and mighty name of Chri&s;t Je&s;us who is King of kings and Lord of lords, and the holy &s;criptures of truth of the Old and New Te&s;tament, do not you u&s;e many women's words in your &s;ervice and wor&s;hip out of the Old and New Te&s;tament? The apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>Let your women keep &s;ilence in the churches;</Q> and that he <Q>did not permit a woman to &s;peak, but to be under obedience; and if &s;he will learn any thing, to a&s;k her hu&s;band at home; for it is a &s;hame for a woman to &s;peak in the church.</Q> And 1 Tim. ii. 11, 12. <Q>Women are to learn in &s;ilence, and not &s;uffered to teach, nor to u&s;urp authority over the man, but to be in &s;ilence,</Q> 1 Cor. xiv. 34. Here the duke may &s;ee what &s;ort of women were to be in &s;ilence and &s;ubjection, whom the law commands to be &s;ilent, and not to un&s;urp authority over the man, nor to &s;peak in the church; the&s;e were unruly women. In the &s;ame chapter he commands <Q>not to plait nor broider their hair, nor to wear gold, pearls, or co&s;tly array.</Q> The&s;e things were forbidden by the apo&s;tle, and women that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ear &s;uch things are to learn in &s;ilence and to be &s;ubject, and not to u&s;urp authority over the men; for it is a &s;hame for &s;uch to &s;peak in the church. But do not &s;uch women as the&s;e that wear gold and &s;ilver, pearls and gaudy appa|rel, or co&s;tly array, and plait and broider their hair, &s;peak in your church, when your prie&s;t &s;ets them to &s;ing p&s;alms? Don't they &s;peak when they &s;ing p&s;alms? Con|&s;ider this, O duke! Yet you &s;ay, <Q>Your women mu&s;t keep &s;ilence in the church, and mu&s;t not &s;peak in the church;</Q> but when they &s;ing p&s;alms in your churches are they &s;ilent? Though the apo&s;tle forbids &s;uch women as before-mentioned to &s;peak in the church, yet in another place he encourages the good or holy women to be teach|ers of good things, Tit. ii. 3.4. The apo&s;tle al&s;o &s;aid, <Q>I intreat thee, true yoke-follow, help tho&s;e women which laboured with me in the go&s;pel, and with other my follow-labourers, who&s;e names are written in the book of life.</Q>
<PB N="333" REF="037441_0849_100D9410EDAF2120">Here he owns the&s;e holy women, and encourages them which laboured with him in the go&s;pel, and did not for|bid them, Phil. iv. 2, 3. He likewi&s;e commends Phoebe unto the church of the Romans, calls her a <Q>&s;ervant un|to the church of Cenchrea,</Q> &s;ends his epi&s;tle by her to the Romans from Corinth, and de&s;ires the church at Rome to "receive her in the Lord, as becometh &s;aints;" and to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, <Q>in what&s;oever bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he had need of; for &s;he had been a &s;uccourer of many, and of him al&s;o:</Q> And he &s;aid, <Q>Greet Pri&s;cilla and Aquila, my helpers in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who have for my life laid down their necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but al&s;o all the churches of the Gentiles.</Q> Now here the duke may &s;ee, the&s;e were good holy women, whom the apo&s;tle did not forbid &s;peaking. Rom. xvi. 1, 2, 3, 4. but commended them. And Pri&s;cilla and Aquila <Q>in&s;tructed and expounded unto Apollos the way of God more perfectly,</Q> Acts xviii. 26. So here Pri&s;cilla was an in&s;tructor as well as Aquila, which holy women the apo&s;tle doth not forbid. Neither did he forbid Philip's four daughters, who were virgins, to prophe&s;y. Women might pray and prophe&s;y in the church, 1 Cor. xi. 5. The apo&s;tles &s;hewed to the Jews the fulfilling of Joel's prophecy: <Q>That in the la&s;t days God would pour out of his Spirit upon all fle&s;h, and their &s;ons and daughters, &s;ervants and handmaids, &s;hould prophe&s;y with the Spirit of God.</Q> So the apo&s;tle en|courages daughters and handmaids to prophe&s;y, as well as &s;ons; and if they do prophe&s;y, they mu&s;t &s;peak to the church or people, Joel ii. 28. Acts xvii. 18. Did not Miriam the prophete&s;s &s;ing unto the Lord, and all the women with her, when the Lord had delivered the chil|dren of I&s;rael from Pharaoh? Did not &s;he prai&s;e the Lord, and prophe&s;y in the congregation of the children of I&s;rael? Was not this in the church? Exod. xv. 21. Mo&s;es and Aaron did not forbid her prophe&s;ying or &s;peaking; but Mo&s;es &s;aid, <Q>Would God all the Lord's people were prophets!</Q> And the Lord's people are wo|men as well as men. Deborah was a judge and a pro|phete&s;s; and do not you make u&s;e of Deborah's and Mi|riam's words in your &s;ervice and wor&s;hip? See Jud. v. 1. to 31. Deborah's large &s;peech or &s;ong. Barak did not forbid her, nor none of the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts. Did not &s;he make this &s;peech or &s;ong in the congregation or church of I&s;rael? In the book of Ruth there are good &s;peeches of

So here the king and his prie&s;ts did not de&s;pi&s;e the coun&s;el of this prophete&s;s; and &s;he prophe&s;ied to the congregation of I&s;rael, as may be &s;een in the&s;e chapters. In Luke i. 41. to 55. &s;ee what a godly &s;peech Mary made al&s;o. Mary &s;aid, <Q>that the Lord did regard the low e&s;tate of his handmaid,</Q> &amp;c. And don't you make u&s;e in your wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of Mary's and Elizabeth's words from Luke ii. 41. to 55. in your churches, and yet forbid women's &s;peaking in your churches, and but to be in &s;ilence? Yet all &s;orts of wo|men &s;peak in your churches when they &s;ing, and &s;ay Amen. In Luke ii. there was Anna the prophete&s;s, a widow, of about four&s;core and four years, who departed not from the temple, but &s;erved God with fa&s;ting and prayer night and day. Did not &s;he confe&s;s Chri&s;t Je&s;us in the temple, and give thanks to the Lord, <Q>and &s;peak of Chri&s;t to all that looked for redemption in Jeru&s;alem?</Q> Luke ii. 36, 37, 38. So &s;uch holy women were not for|bidden to &s;peak in the church, neither in the law nor go&s;|pel. Was it not Mary Magdalen and other women that fir&s;t preached Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection to the apo&s;tles? The woman indeed (namely Eve) was fir&s;t in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; &s;o they were women that fir&s;t preached the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t Je&s;us; for Chri&s;t &s;aid to Mary, &amp;c. <Q>Go to my brethren and &s;ay unto them, I a&s;cend unto my Father and to your Father, and to my God and to your God,</Q> John xx. 17. And Luke xxiv. 10. It was Mary Mag|dalen, Johanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women with them, who told the apo&s;tles, <Q>Chri&s;t was ri&s;en from the dead; and their words and the&s;e women's words were as idle tales to the apo&s;tles, and they believed them not,</Q> ib. 11. Ver. 22. <Q>Certain women al&s;o of our company made us a&s;toni&s;hed,</Q> they &s;aid. So here it may be &s;een that the women's preaching the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t did a&s;toni&s;h the apo&s;tles. Chri&s;t &s;ent the&s;e women to preach his re&s;urrection; &s;o it is no &s;hame for &s;uch wo|men
<PB N="335" REF="037441_0851_100D941472CD62E8">to preach Chri&s;t Je&s;us, neither are they to be &s;ilent when Chri&s;t &s;ends them. The apo&s;tle &s;ays, <Q>Every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s to God,</Q> Rom. xiv. 11, and <Q>Every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the glo|ry of God the Father,</Q> Philip. ii. 11. So here it is clear that women mu&s;t confe&s;s Chri&s;t as well as men, if every tongue mu&s;t confe&s;s. And the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>There's neither male nor female, for ye are all one in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</Q> Gal. iii. 28.</P>
<P>And whereas it is &s;aid, <Q>women mu&s;t a&s;k their hu&s;|bands at home,</Q> &amp;c. the duke knows very well, virgins have no hu&s;bands, nor widows; for Anna, the prophete&s;s, was a widow; and if Chri&s;t be the hu&s;band, men mu&s;t a&s;k coun&s;el of him at home, as well as women, before they teach. And &s;et the ca&s;e that a Turk's wife &s;hould be a Chri&s;tian, or a Papi&s;t's wife &s;hould be a Lutheran, or a Calvini&s;t, mu&s;t they a&s;k and learn of their hu&s;bands at home before they confe&s;s Chri&s;t Je&s;us in the congregation of the Lord? Their coun&s;el will be to them to turn Turks or Papi&s;ts.</P>
<P>I intreat the duke to con&s;ider the&s;e things. I intreat him to mind God's grace and truth in his heart, that is come by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that by his Spirit of grace and truth he may come to &s;erve and wor&s;hip God in his Spirit and truth; &s;o that he may &s;erve the living eternal God that made him, in his generation, and have his peace in Chri&s;t that the world cannot take away. And I do de&s;ire his good, peace, and pro&s;perity in this world, and his eternal comfort and happine&s;s in the world that is everla&s;ting, Amen.</P>

<P>About a month after I got a little out of London, vi&s;it|ing friends at South-&s;treet, Ford-green, and Enfield, where I had meetings. Afterwards I went to Waltham-abbey, and was at a meeting there on a fir&s;t-day; which was very large and peaceable. Then returning through Enfield, and about Edmonton-&s;ide, I came back to London in the third month, to advi&s;e with and a&s;&s;i&s;t friends in laying their &s;uf|ferings before the parliament then &s;itting; and we drew up a &s;hort account of our &s;ufferings, which we cau&s;ed to be printed and &s;pread among&s;t the parliament-men.</P>

The yearly meeting coming on, I was much concerned for friends that came up to it out of the country, le&s;t they &s;hould meet with any trouble or di&s;turbance in their pa&s;&s;age up or down; and the rather, becau&s;e about that time a great bu&s;tle aro&s;e in the nation upon the duke of Mon|mouth's landing in the We&s;t.

<P>Con&s;idering the hurries that were in the nation, it came upon me at the clo&s;e of this meeting to write a few lines to friends, <Q>to caution all to keep out of the &s;pirit of the world, in which trouble is, and to dwell in the peaceable truth;</Q> as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends and brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHOM the Lord hath called and cho&s;en in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, your Life and Salvation, in whom ye have re&s;t and peace with God; the Lord by his mighty power, which is over all, hath pre&s;erved and &s;upported you to this day, to be a peculiar holy people to him&s;elf, &s;o that by his eternal Spirit and power ye might be all kept out of the world; for in the world is trouble. In this great day of the Lord God Almighty, he is &s;haking the heavens and the earth of outward profe&s;&s;ions, their elements are in a heat, their &s;un and their moon are darkened, the &s;tars falling, and the mountains and hills &s;haking and tottering, as it was among the Jews in the day of Chri&s;t's appearing. Therefore, dear friends and brethren, dwell in the Seed, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Rock and Foundation, that cannot be &s;haken; that ye may &s;ee with the light and Spirit of Chri&s;t, that ye are as fixed &s;tars in the firmament of God's power; and in this his power and light you'll &s;ee over all the wan|dering &s;tars, clouds without water, and trees without fruit.

<P>Dear friends and brethren, whatever bu&s;tlings and trou|ble, tumults or outrages, quarrels and &s;trife, ari&s;e in the world, keep out of them all; concern not your&s;elves with them; but keep in the Lord's power and peaceable truth, that is over all &s;uch things; in which power ye &s;eek the peace and good of all men.

<P>I wrote &s;everal other letters to friends, in divers foreign countries, from whom I had received letters about the affairs of truth. Which when I had di&s;patched, I got a little way out of town, being much &s;pent with the heat of the weather, throngs in meetings, and continual bu&s;ine&s;s. I went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fir&s;t to South-&s;treet, where I abode &s;ome days. And a great &s;en&s;e entered me of the growth and increa&s;e of pride, vanity, and exce&s;s in apparel, and that not only among&s;t the people of the world, but too much al&s;o in &s;ome that came among us, and &s;eemed to make profe&s;&s;ion of the truth. In the &s;en&s;e I had of the evil thereof, it came upon me to give &s;orth the following, as a reproof and check thereunto.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>The apo&s;tle Peter &s;aith (in 1 Pet. iii.) of the women's adorning; <Q>Let it not be (mark, let it not be: this is a po&s;itive prohibition) that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet &s;pirit, which is in the &s;ight of God of great price; for af|ter this manner in old time the holy women al&s;o, who tru&s;ted in God, adorned them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>Here ye may &s;ee what is the ornament of the holy wo|men,
<PB N="340" REF="037441_0856_100D941E871CADC0">which was in the &s;ight of God of great price, which the holy women who tru&s;ted in God adorned them&s;elves with. But the unholy women, that tru&s;t not in God, their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rnament is not a meek and a quiet &s;pirit; they adorn them&s;elves with plaiting the hair, putting on of apparel, and wearing of gold, which is forbidden by the apo&s;lle in his general epi&s;tle to the church of Chri&s;t, the true Chri&s;|trans.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle Paul &s;aith. 1 Tim. ii. 9, 10. <Q>In like manner al&s;o that women adorn them&s;elves in mode&s;t ap|parel, with &s;hame&s;acedne&s;s and &s;obriety, not with broi|dered hair or gold, or pearls, or co&s;tly array; but, which becometh women profe&s;&s;ing godline&s;s, with good works.</Q></P>
<P>Here ye may &s;ee what the women were not to adorn them&s;elves with who profe&s;&s;ed godline&s;s: they were not to adorn them&s;elves with who profe&s;&s;ed godline&s;s: they were not to adorn them&s;elves with broidered hair, nor gold, nor pearls, nor co&s;tly array; for this was not looked upon to be mo|de&s;t apparel for holy women that profe&s;&s;ed godline&s;s and good works. But this adorning or apparel is for the im|mode&s;t, un&s;hamefaced, un&s;ober women. that profe&s;s not godline&s;s, neither follow tho&s;e good works that God com|mands. Therefore it doth not become men and women, who pro&s;e&s;s true Chri&s;tianity and godline&s;s, to be adorned with gold. or chains, or pearls, or co&s;tly array, or with broidered hair; for the&s;e things are for the lu&s;t of the eye, the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, and pride of life, which is not of the Father. All holy men and women are to mind that which is more precious than gold; <Q>being redeemed not with corruptible things, as &s;ilver and gold, from your vain conver&s;ation, but with the precious blood of Chri&s;t, as a lamb without blemi&s;h and without &s;pot. Therefore as obedient children to God, not fa&s;hioning your&s;elves ac|cording to your former lu&s;is in your ignorance, but as he which hath called you is holy, &s;o be ye holy in all manner of conver&s;ation</Q> 1 Pet. i. 14.15.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t &s;aith <Q>The life is more than meat, and the bo|dy is more than raiment.</Q>Luke xii. 23.</P>
<P>I read of a wi&s;e moral philo&s;opher, who, meeting a wo|man with her neck and brea&s;t Lare, laid his hand upon her and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">l "Woman, wilt thou &s;ell this fle&s;h?" and &s;he re|plying.

<PB N="341" REF="037441_0857_100D94217317AA88">backs bare, and not mode&s;t people, even among the mo|ral heathens. Therefore tho&s;e that profe&s;s the knowledge of true Chri&s;tianity &s;hould be a&s;hamed of &s;uch things. You may &s;ee a book written by the very Papi&s;ts, and an|other by Richard Baxter the Pre&s;byterian, again&s;t bare brea&s;ts and bare backs.

Read, I pray you, the third of I&s;aiah. There you may &s;ee the holy prophet was grieved with the fooli&s;h women's vain attire. and was &s;ent by the Lord to reprove them.

Whether ye be the Lord's pri&s;on|ers for his name and truth's &s;ake, or at liberty, in all things labour to be content, for that is a continual fea&s;t; and let no trouble move you; then ye will be as Mount Sion that cannot be removed. In all things exerci&s;e the word of patience, which word will &s;anctify all things to you. Study to be quiet, and do the Lord's bu&s;ine&s;s that he requires of you, and your own, in truth and righteou&s;|ne&s;s. What&s;oever ye do, let it be done to the prai&s;e and glory of God in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. All that make God's people &s;uffer, make the &s;eed &s;uffer in their own par|tieulars, and impri&s;on the ju&s;t there. Such will not-vi&s;it the &s;eed in them&s;elves, but ca&s;t it into pri&s;on-in others, and not vi&s;it it in pri&s;on. You may read that Chri&s;t, &s;aith, "Such mu&s;t go into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment." That is a &s;ad puni&s;hment and pri&s;on.

Such are unfaithful to God and man, and are enemies to every good work and &s;ervice of God; but their end will be according to their works, who are like the earth that hath often received rain, but brings forth briers and thorns, which are to be rejected, and are for the fire. Therefore, dear friends, in all your &s;ufferings feel the Lord's eternal arm and power, which hath &s;upported you to this day, and will to the end, as your faith &s;tands in it, and as you are &s;ettled upon the rock and foundation Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that cannot be removed, in whom ye have life and peace with God. The Lord God Almighty, in him, give you do|minion, and pre&s;erve you all to his glory, that in all your &s;ufferings ye may feel his pre&s;ence, and that, when ye have fini&s;hed your te&s;timony, ye may receive the crown of glory which God hath laid up for them that fear and &s;erve him, Amen.</P>

<P>Having &s;pent about a week in the country, I returned to London; where I continued about two months, vi&s;iting
<PB N="344" REF="037441_0860_100D94258D304C08">meetings, and labouring to get relief for friends from their &s;ufferings, which yet lay heavy upon them in many parts of the nation. I al&s;o wrote &s;everal papers relating to the &s;er|vice of truth, one of which was concerning order in the church of God, which &s;ome that were gone out of the unity of friends did much oppo&s;e. It was as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>AMONG all &s;ocieties, or families, or nations of peo|ple in the world, they have among them &s;ome &s;ort of order. There was the order of Aaron in the Old Te&s;|tament, and there was the order of Melchi&s;edeck before that, after who&s;e order Chri&s;t Je&s;us came, and he did not de&s;pi&s;e that order. God is a God of order in his whole creation, and in his church; and all believers in the light, the life in Chri&s;t, that pa&s;s from death to life, are in the order of the Holy Spirit, power, light, life, and govern|ment of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, of the increa&s;e whereof there is no end. This is a my&s;tery to all tho&s;e di&s;orderly people, who have written and printed &s;o much again&s;t order, which the Lord's power and Spirit hath brought forth among his people. And you that cry &s;o much agian&s;t order, is it not manife&s;t that you are gone into a land of darkne&s;s, thick as darkne&s;s it&s;elf, and of the &s;hadow of death, into di&s;order, and where the light is as darkne&s;s? Is not this your condition &s;een by all them that live and walk in the truth, and who&s;e conver&s;ations are according to the go&s;pel of life and &s;alvation?</P>
<P>The devil, Satan, dragon, the fir&s;t and &s;econd bea&s;t, the whore and fal&s;e prophets, and their wor&s;hippers and followers, all are out of the truth, abode not in it, nor in the order of it: and the truth is over them all. In Salem is God's tabernacle; and his tabernacle is in Shiloh: the&s;e are far beyond the tabernacles of Ham, P&s;alm lxxvi, and lxxviii.</P>
<P>All the figures and &s;hadows were and are comprehend|ed in time; but Chri&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance is the beginning and the ending. And all trials, troubles, per&s;ecutions, and temptations came up in time: but the Lord's power, which is everla&s;ting, is over all &s;uch things; in which is &s;afety.</P>
<P>The black world of darkne&s;s lieth in wickedne&s;s, and by their wi&s;dom know not God that made the world and all things therein: for the god of the world and prince of the air ruleth in the hearts of all that di&s;obey the living
<PB N="345" REF="037441_0861_100D94272312AB10">God who made them. So the god of this wicked world hath blinded the eyes of the in&s;idels or heathen; &s;o that this wicked world by their wi&s;dom doth not know the living God.</P>
<P>In the Old Te&s;tament the Lord &s;aid, <Q>With all thy offerings thou &s;halt offer &s;alt.</Q> Levit. ii. 13. And Chri&s;t &s;aith in his new covenant. <Q>Every one &s;hall be &s;alted with fire, and every &s;acrifice &s;hall be &s;alted with &s;alt. Salt is good; but if the &s;alt have lo&s;t its &s;altne&s;s, wherewith will you &s;ea&s;on it? Have &s;alt in your&s;elves, and have peace one with another,</Q> Mark ix. 48, 49, 50.</P>
<P>We have received the earne&s;t of the Spirit, which is the carne&s;t of the inheritance that fadeth not away. For God poureth out of his Spirit upon all fle&s;h. It is God's Spirit, which is above our natural &s;pirit (by which alone we do not know God;) for it is by the Spirit of God that we know the things of God. And the Spirit of God doth witne&s;s to our &s;ouls and &s;pirits, that it &s;elf is the earne&s;t of an eternal inheritance. <Q>God opens his people's ears to di&s;cipline, and commands that they turn from iniquity. If they obey and &s;erve him, they &s;hall &s;pend their days in pro&s;perity, and their years in plea&s;ure: but if they obey him not, they &s;hall peri&s;h by the &s;word, and they &s;hall die without knowledge,</Q> Job xxxvi. 10, 11, 12. So the di&s;obedient, that do not turn from their iniquity, have not this pro&s;perity and plea&s;ure; but die without the knowledge of God; and their ears are &s;hut to this di&s;ci|pline, which God opens to his people.</P>

<P>When I had been about two months in London, I was &s;ent for to my &s;on Rou&s;e's at King&s;ton, to vi&s;it a daughter of his, who at that time lay very &s;ick; but recovered. Whil&s;t I &s;taid there, I had &s;everal meetings with friends: and returning by Hammer&s;mith, &s;taid the fir&s;t-day meeting there, which was large and peaceable. Having vi&s;ited friends thereabouts. I came back to London again; being very intent upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of getting redre&s;s for &s;uffering friends. In this and other &s;ervices I continued at London till the latter end of the eleventh month; &s;ave that I went to vi&s;it an ancient friend at Bethnal-Green, with whom I tarried three or four days. While I was there, I was much exerci&s;ed, in the &s;en&s;e of the enemy's working, to draw from the holy way of truth into a fal&s;e liberty, and &s;o into the
<PB N="346" REF="037441_0862_100D9429F668E4E0">world's ways and wor&s;hips again. And the example of the back&s;liding Jews coming before me, I was moved to write the following, as a warning to all &s;uch:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>YOU may &s;ee, when the Jews rebelled again&s;t the good Spirit of God, which he gave to in&s;truct them, they for&s;ook him and his law, way, and wor&s;hip, went a whoring after Balaam's ways, and became like the <Q>wild a&s;s's colt, &s;nuffing up the wind,</Q> Jer. ii. 24. In Jer. iii. &s;ee how Judah played the harlot under every green tree, and upon every high mountain; therefore the Lord di|vorced Judah, as he had divorced I&s;rael when &s;he for&s;ook his way, and followed the ways of the heathen. Though the Lord had fed them to the full, yet they <Q>for&s;ook him, committed adultery, and a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves together in harlots hou&s;es,</Q> Jer. v. 7. <Q>And with their whoredom they defiled the land, and committed adultery with &s;tocks and &s;tones.</Q> Jer. iii. 9. Here you may &s;ee, when they for&s;ook the living, eternal God, they followed the reli|gions and wor&s;hips of other nations, who&s;e gods were made of &s;tocks and &s;tones, which the Jews wor&s;hipped, and committed adultery withal. When they for&s;ook the living God, and his way and wor&s;hip, they for&s;ook the wor&s;hip at Jeru&s;alem at the temple, and followed the hea|thens wor&s;hips in the mountains and fields: So it was called adultery and whoredom, to join with other reli|gions, and for&s;ake God, Jer. xiii. 27.</P>
<P>And now, if the children of the New Jeru&s;alem that is above would for&s;ake the wor&s;hip that Chri&s;t in his New Te&s;tament &s;et up. (which is in Spirit and in truth) and follow the wor&s;hip of nations, which men have &s;et up; will not they commit adultery with them, in for&s;aking God's wor&s;hip, and Chri&s;t the new and living way?</P>
<P>In Jer. xliv. ye may &s;ee how the children of Judah provoked the Lord again&s;t them, by wor&s;hipping the works of their own hands, and following the gods of the land of Egypt. In this they committed adultery, for&s;ak|ing the living God, their hu&s;band, and his wor&s;hip; and there ye may &s;ee God's judgments pronounced again&s;t them to their de&s;truction. What will become of tho&s;e that for&s;ake the wor&s;hip in Spirit and truth, which Chri&s;t &s;et up; and wor&s;hip the works of their own hands in &s;pi|ritual Egypt, and follow &s;piritual Egypt's will-wor&s;hip, which they invented? May not this be called whoredom
<PB N="347" REF="037441_0863_100D942C4D1F38F0">in them that for&s;ake Chri&s;t, the new and living way, his pure religion, and the wor&s;hip that he hath &s;et up? And they that for&s;ake the Lord's way and his wor&s;hip, and fol|low the world's ways and wor&s;hips, do not they, who&s;e way they follow, become at la&s;t their enemies? as in La|ment. 1. See how the Jews for&s;ook the Lord's way and wor&s;hip, and doted on other lovers (the A&s;&s;yrians, &amp;c.) and with all their idols were defiled; and how they retain|ed the whoredoms brought from Egypt, and were polluted with the Babylonians bed: read Ezek. xxiii. When they for&s;ook the Lord, his way and wor&s;hip, and followed the way and wor&s;hip of the heathen; then it was &s;aid, <Q>They went a whoring after others, and committed adultery with them.</Q></P>
<P>Ye may &s;ee Ezek. xvi. the &s;tate of the Jews was liken|ed to that of their &s;i&s;ter Sodom, which had played the harlot with the A&s;&s;yrians, committed fornication with the Egyptians, and increa&s;ed their whoredoms, in following their abominable idols; therefore the Lord carried away the two tribes, that for&s;ook him, into Babylon; &s;ee Ezek. xvii. 20. And they that for&s;ake Chri&s;t, the new and liv|ing Way, and the wor&s;hip of God in Spirit and truth, which Chri&s;t &s;et up in his New Te&s;tament, go into cap|tivity in &s;piritual Babylon.</P>
<P>Ho&s;ea ii. you may &s;ee how the prophet di&s;covers the whoredoms and idolatry of the Jews who for&s;ook the Lord, and compares them to an harlot. And in chap. iii. ye may &s;ee the de&s;truction threatened again&s;t the Jews for their impiety and idolatry. In ch. ix. al&s;o the di&s;tre&s;s and captivity of the Jews is threatened for their &s;ins and idolatry; and again they are reproved and threatened for their impiety and idolatry, Ho&s; x. This was for for&s;ak|ing the Lord and his way, and following the ways of their own inventions, and the ways of the heathen.</P>
<P>Doth not I&s;aiah &s;ay, <Q>That the Lord would vi&s;it Tyre, and that &s;he &s;hould commit fornication with all the king|doms upon the face of the earth?</Q> therefore the Lord threatened de&s;truction upon her, ch. xxiii. In ch. lvii. you may &s;ee how the Lord reproved the Jews for their whori&s;h idolatry, &s;aying, <Q>Upon an high and lo&s;ty moun|tain ha&s;t thou &s;et thy bed, even thither wente&s;t thou up to offer &s;acrifices. Thou ha&s;t enlarged thy bed, and made a covenant with them, thou love&s;t their bed where thou &s;awe&s;t it.</Q> This was a joining to the heathen's re|ligions,
<PB N="348" REF="037441_0864_100D942DE1972AB8">altars, and &s;acrifices, and for&s;aking the Lord's al|tar and &s;acrifices, which he commanded in the law; and therefore that was committing whoredom with the heathen, and a going into their beds from the Living God that made them. And now in the New Te&s;tament God hav|ing "poured his Spirit upon all fle&s;h." that by it all might come to be a <Q>royal prie&s;thood, to offer up &s;pirit|ual &s;acrifices to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</Q> all that err from the Spirit of God. and rebel again&s;t it, are not like to offer &s;piritual &s;acrifices to God; the &s;acrifice of &s;uch God doth not accept, no more than he did that of the heathens or the Jews, who rebelled again&s;t his good Spirit that he gave them to in&s;truct them.</P>
<P>You may &s;ee in the 17th, 18th, and 19th chapters of the Revelation the puni&s;hment of the great whore, Baby|lon, the mother of harlots, and the victory of the Lamb, and how he calleth God's people out of Babylon; for <Q>in her was found the blood of the prophets, and of the &s;aints, and of all that were &s;lain upon the earth.</Q> There ye may read her judgment and downfal. This whore are they that are whored from the Spirit of God, and &s;o from God. from his holy wor&s;hip in &s;pirit and truth, from the pure undefiled religion that keeps from the &s;pots of the world, from the new and living way of Chri&s;t Je&s;us; the&s;e are whored from the Spirit of God into fal&s;e religions, ways, and wor&s;hips, and &s;o have corrupted the earth with her abominations. But her judgment and downfal are &s;een, over whom Chri&s;t hath the victory; and the marri|age of the Lamb is come, glory to the Lord for ever! And God's pure religion, and pure wor&s;hip in Spirit and truth Chri&s;t hath &s;et up, as it was in the apo&s;tles days, Hallelujah.</P>

<P>I &s;oon returned to London, but made no long &s;tay there, my body not being able to bear the clo&s;ene&s;s of the city long together. While I was in town, be&s;ides the u&s;ual &s;ervices of <Q>vi&s;iting friends, and taking care about their &s;uf|ferings to get them ea&s;ed,</Q> I a&s;&s;i&s;ted the friends of the city in di&s;tributing certain &s;ums of money, which our friends of Ireland had charitably and very liberally rai&s;ed, and &s;ent over hither for the relief of their brethren who &s;uffered for the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience; which monies were di&s;tri|buted

<P>Before I left the city I heard of a great doctor lately come from Poland, whom I invited to my lodging, and had a great deal of di&s;cour&s;e with him. After I had informed my|&s;elf by him of &s;uch things as I had a de&s;ire to know, I wrote a letter to the king of Poland on behalf of friends at Dant|zick, who had long been under grievous &s;ufferings. A copy whereof follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>TO JOHN the third, king of Poland, great duke of Li|thuania, Ru&s;&s;ia, and Pru&s;&s;ia, defender of the city of Dantzick, &amp;c.<LB>
Concerning the innocent and afflicted people in &s;corn called Quakers, who are now fed with bread and wa|ter in Bridewell of the afore&s;aid city, under clo&s;e con|finement, where their friends, wives, and children are hardly &s;uffered to come to &s;ee them.<LB>
Oh king!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE magi&s;trates of the city of Dantzick &s;ay it is thy order and command that the&s;e innocent and afflicted people &s;hould &s;uffer &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion. Now this puni&s;h|ment is inflicted upon them only becau&s;e they come toge|ther in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their Redeemer and Sa|viour, who died for their &s;ins, and is ri&s;en from the dead for their ju&s;tification, who is their prophet, whom God hath rai&s;ed up like unto Mo&s;es; whom they ought to hear in all things in this day of the go&s;pel and new covenant; who went a&s;tray like &s;cattered &s;heep, but now are returned to the Chief, Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of their Souls, 1 Pet. ii. 25. <Q>Who has given his life for his &s;heep, and they hear his voice and follow him;</Q> who leads them into his "pa&s;tures of life," John x.</P>
<P>Now, O king! I under&s;tand thou openly pro&s;e&s;&s;e&s;t Chri&s;tianity, and the great and mighty name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is King of kings and Lord of lords, to whom is given all power in heaven and earth, who rules all na|tions with a rod of iron. Therefore, O king, it &s;eems hard to us, that any who openly confe&s;s Chri&s;t Je&s;us (yea the magi&s;trates of Dantzick do the &s;ame) &s;hould inflict tho&s;e puni&s;hments upon an innocent and harmle&s;s people, by rea&s;on of their tender con&s;ciences only, becau&s;e they
<PB N="350" REF="037441_0866_100D94326B4B6F60">come together to &s;erve and wor&s;hip the Eternal God, who made them, in Spirit and in truth; which wor&s;hip Chri&s;t Je&s;us has &s;et up &s;ixteen hundred years ago, as we read in John iv. 23, 24.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech the king that he would con&s;ider, whether Chri&s;t in the New Te&s;tament ever gave &s;uch a command to his apo&s;tles that they &s;hould &s;hut up any in pri&s;on, and feed them with bread and water, who were not conforma|ble in every particular to their religion, faith, and wor&s;hip? Where did the apo&s;tles exerci&s;e &s;uch things in the true church after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion? Is not this the doctrine of Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles, that Chri&s;t's followers &s;hould <Q>love their enemies, and pray for them that hate, per&s;ecute, and de&s;pitefully u&s;e them?</Q> Mat. v.</P>
<P>Is it not a &s;hame to Chri&s;tendom among the Turks and others, that one Chri&s;tian &s;hould per&s;ecute another for the doctrine of faith, wor&s;hip, and religion? They cannot prove that Chri&s;t ever gave them &s;uch a command, whom they profe&s;s to be their Lord and Ma&s;ter. For Chri&s;t &s;ays, that his believers and followers &s;hould "love one another;" and by this they &s;hould be known to be his di&s;ciples. And did not Chri&s;t reprove tho&s;e who would have <Q>fire to come down from heaven</Q> to de&s;troy them who would not receive him? Did not he tell them, <Q>they did not know what &s;pirit they were of?</Q> Have all who have per|&s;ecuted men, or taken away their lives becau&s;e they would not receive their religion, known what &s;pirit they were or are of? Is it not good for all to know by the Spirit of Chri&s;t what &s;pirit they are of? The apo&s;tle &s;ays, Rom. viii. 9. <Q>If any man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t he is none of his.</Q> And 2 Cor. x. 4. <Q>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but &s;piritual, &amp;c.

Thus we &s;ee, the fight of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians and their weapons in the days of the apo&s;tles were &s;piritual.</P>
<P>Would not the king and the magi&s;trates of Dantzick think it contrary to their con&s;ciences, if they &s;hould be forced by the Turk to his religion? Would it not in like manner, &s;eem hard to the magi&s;trates of Dantzick, and contrary to their con&s;ciences, if they &s;hould be forced to the religion of the king of Poland? or the king of Poland, if he &s;hould be compelled to the religion of the magi&s;trates of Dantzick? And if they would not be &s;ubject thereunto, that t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y &s;hould be bani&s;hed from their wives and families,

<P>We be&s;eech the king with all Chri&s;tian humility, and the magi&s;trates of Dantzick, that they would order their proceedings in this matter according to the royal law of God, which is, <Q>to do unto others as they would have others do unto them, and to love their neighbour as them&s;elves.</Q> For we have this charity, that we hope and believe the king of Poland and his people, with the ma|gi&s;trates of Dantzick, own the writings of the New Te&s;ta|ment as well as of the Old; therefore we be&s;eech the king and the magi&s;trates of Dantzick, to take heed that their work of impri&s;oning an innocent people, for nothing but their meeting together in tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience to &s;erve and wor&s;hip God, their Creator, may not be contrary and oppo&s;ite to the royal law of God, and to the glorious and everla&s;ting go&s;pel of truth.</P>
<P>We de&s;ire the king, in Chri&s;tian love, earne&s;tly and weightily to con&s;ider the&s;e things, and to give order to &s;et the innocent pri&s;oners, our friends, called Quakers, at li|berty from their &s;trict confinement in Dantzick, that they may have freedom to &s;erve and wor&s;hip the Living God in Spirit and in truth, and go home to their habitations, and follow their trades and calling, to maintain their wives, children and families. And we believe that the king, in doing &s;uch a noble, glorious, yea Chri&s;tian work, will not go unrewarded from the Great God who made him, whom we &s;erve and wor&s;hip, who has the hearts of kings, and their lives and length of days in his hand.</P>
<P>From him who de&s;ires the king and all his mini&s;ters may be pre&s;erved in the fear of God, and receive his word of wi&s;dom, by which all things were made and created, that by it he may come to order all things to the glory of God, which God has put under his hand; that both he and they may enjoy the comforts and ble&s;&s;ings of the Lord in this life, and in that which is to come life eternal, Amen.</P>

Wherefore I wrote a paper, proving by the &s;crip|tures of truth, that the church of Chri&s;t hath power and abi|lity to judge tho&s;e that profe&s;s to be of it, not only with re&s;pect to outward things relating to this world, but with re&s;pect to religious matters al&s;o. A copy of which follows:</P>

<HEAD>Concerning Judging.</HEAD>
<P><Q>THE natural man receiveth not the things of the Spi|rit of God, for they are fooli&s;hne&s;s to him, neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned; but he that is &s;piritual judgeth all things (mark) all things, yet he him&s;elf is judged of no man,</Q> 1 Cor. ii. 14, 15. So the natural man cannot judge of tho&s;e things he re|ceives not, for they are fooli&s;hne&s;s to him; but he is com|prehended by the &s;piritual man, and his fooli&s;hne&s;s, and is judged, though he cannot judge the &s;piritual man.</P>
<P>"Do not ye judge them that are within?" &s;aith the apo&s;|tle. This power the church had and hath, <Q>therefore put away from among&s;t your&s;elves that wicked per&s;on.</Q> Did not this wicked per&s;on, think you, profe&s;s and plead for liberty for his wickedne&s;s, and his freedom, as he was a Chri&s;tian, who was looked upon as a member of the church?</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>For I verily, as ab&s;ent in body, yet pre&s;ent in Spirit, have judged already, as though I were pre&s;ent, concerning him that hath done this wicked deed,</Q> 1 Cor. v. 3, 12. Here the apo&s;tle did judge, though afar off, and &s;et up judgment in the church again&s;t fal&s;e liberty, under what pretence &s;oever it was.</P>
<P>And the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>Dare any of you, having a mat|ter again&s;t a brother, go to law before the unju&s;t and not before the &s;aints?</Q> Here the &s;aints, the church, are to judge of things among&s;t them&s;elves, and not the unju&s;t to judge of their matters. <Q>Do ye not know the &s;aints &s;hall
<PB N="353" REF="037441_0869_100D9438983FFA30">judge the world?</Q> So the &s;aints are to judge the unju&s;t, and not the unju&s;t to judge their matters.</P>
<P>And farther the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>If the world &s;hall be judged by you (to wit, the &s;aints) are you unworthy to judge the &s;maller matters among&s;t you?</Q></P>
<P>It is clear that the &s;aints have a judgment given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Chri&s;t, by his power and Spirit, light and wi&s;dom, to judge the world, and not to carry their matters before the unju&s;t, but to judge of the among&s;t them&s;elves; and if they carry them before the unju&s;t, they &s;hew their un|worthine&s;s of the &s;aints judgment.</P>
<P>Again, <Q>Know ye not, that we &s;hall judge the angels? (and angels are &s;pirits) how much more the things which pertain to this life?</Q></P>
<P><Q>If ye then have judgment of things pertaining to this life. &s;et them up to judge who have lea&s;t e&s;teem in the church,</Q> 1 Cor. iv. 6. Here it is clear the church of Chri&s;t has a judgment in the power and Spirit of God, not only to judge in "things that pertain to this life;" but al&s;o to judge of things betwixt brethren, without bro|ther going to law with brother before unbelievers; which was a fault, and to be judged, if they did &s;o.</P>
<P>But all the &s;aints have a judgment to judge angels that kept not their habitations, and the world. Jude <Q>judged the angels that kept not their habitations, their fir&s;t &s;tate.</Q> Did not he judge in divine matters here? He judged the &s;tate of Cain, Balaam, and Core, and &s;uch Chri&s;tians as were got into their &s;teps, and were gone as far as they, though they profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves Chri&s;tians? Here again he judged in divine matters, and of their &s;tates and beings, who &s;tood in the divine principle, and who were fallen from it.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>Try the &s;pirits, and believe not every &s;pirit,</Q> 1 John 4. Here again was a judgment in divine matters; and he judged &s;uch as went out from them, which whil&s;t they were with them they had &s;ight of things and openings, but when they went from them, they went from the anointing; therefore he exhorts the &s;aints to keep to the anointing. Such as went from them that had the anointing, came to be the &s;educers and fal&s;e prophets that went into the world.</P>
<P>John had a judgment to try &s;acrifices, and di&s;tingui&s;h|ed Cain's from Abel's, and by the Spirit of God knew which God accepted, and which he did not accept, 1 John
<PB N="354" REF="037441_0870_100D943BB0A87778">iii. 1.2. Paul judged and tried &s;uch me&s;&s;engers and apo&s;|tles, and transformers of them&s;elves like to the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t, and would have the church to try &s;uch, and have the &s;ame judgment as he had, 2 Cor. xi.</P>
<P>Peter judged Ananias and Sapphira, and the thoughts of Simon Magus, who would have been a worker of mira|cles for money. Was not all this judgment in divine mat|ters? The apo&s;tle Paul judged the preachers of circumci|&s;ion both in the Romans and Galatians. For it was the faith and liberty of tho&s;e preachers to preach up circumci&s;ion, though it was a wrong faith. Did not the apo&s;tle here again judge in divine matters?</P>
<P>James judged in matters of faith, and manife&s;ted the liv|ing faith from the dead one. He al&s;o judged in matters of religion, the vain religion from the pure religion, and di&s;|tingui&s;hed them.</P>
<P>Paul judged of the <Q>fal&s;e brethren that would &s;py out the liberty of the true, to whom he would give no place by fubjection, no not for an hour, that the truth of the go&s;|pel might continue with the &s;aints,</Q> Gal. ii. Did not the apo&s;tle here judge in divine matters? And he judged concerning the matters of the go&s;pel, when &s;ome came to pervert them with another go&s;pel, and &s;aid, <Q>The go&s;pel which I received is not of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q> Gal. i. 12. So here was a judgment to di&s;tingui&s;h the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t from all other go&s;pels which were accur&s;ed, which after man are received of man, and taught of man, and not by the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Gal. i. And he had judg|ment to know, <Q>Who made the go&s;pel chargeable, and who kept it without charge.</Q></P>
<P>He &s;et up a judgment in the church, that the believers &s;hould not be unequally yoked, and to &s;ee when men had a communion in the light, and when they had it in dark|ne&s;s, when with Chri&s;t and when with Baal, with the believer and unbeliever, with the temple of God and with Idols, as in 2 Cor. 6. Did he not &s;et up a clear judg|ment here in divine matters in the church?</P>
<P>And the apo&s;tle judged &s;uch libertines through their knowledge that could &s;it at meat in the idol-temple, which cau&s;ed the weak brother to peri&s;h, through his knowledge and liberty, for whom Chri&s;t died. The&s;e, it is like, did profe&s;s it was their faith and their liberty, yet did not keep
<PB N="355" REF="037441_0871_100D943DDBC07E00">in the unity of the true faith, but went a&s;tray to de&s;troy it, 1 Cor. viii.</P>
<P>Peter gives judgment upon the angels that &s;inned and were ca&s;t down into hell, of the &s;tate of the old world, and of Sodom, and the &s;tate of the fal&s;e prophets then among&s;t them, that could &s;peak great &s;welling words of vanity, and whil&s;t they promi&s;ed them liberty were them&s;elves the &s;er|vants of corruption. Had not Peter here a judgment in divine matters? The&s;e were &s;uch, who&s;e work was to bring into bondage, being like the dog and &s;ow that were wa&s;hed; which &s;hews that they had been wa&s;hed, but were turned into the mire again. The apo&s;tle Paul had a judg|ment upon &s;uch with their fair words and men's wi&s;dom, that deceived the hearts of the &s;imple, and upon &s;uch as <Q>&s;erved not the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but their own bellies, and were enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t.</Q> He had a judg|ment and di&s;cerning who lived in the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and who did not, and exhorted all to live in the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, the righteous power of God, that &s;lew all deceit and the deeds of the old man; agreeable to Chri&s;t's words. <Q>He that will be my di&s;ciple, mu&s;t take up his cro&s;s, and fol|low me.</Q> Was not here a judgment again in divine matters, of &s;uch as walked in the divine power, and &s;uch as did not?</P>
<P>Chri&s;t &s;ets up a judgment in his &s;even churches, and commends them that did keep in his judgment, and had tried them which &s;aid, "They were apo&s;tles," who might pretend they were &s;ent of God and Chri&s;t, and were not; but the Church of Chri&s;t had found them liars. Chri&s;t commended this judgment of the church of Ephe&s;us, be|cau&s;e they had <Q>not borne with them that were evil, but had tried tho&s;e fal&s;e apo&s;tles;</Q> and Chri&s;t commends this church, for that they had <Q>hated the deeds of the Nico|laitans, which he al&s;o bated;</Q> and had not the&s;e Nicolai|tans &s;prung from Nicholas, one of the deacons? and were not tho&s;e become a &s;ect of Chri&s;tians? Though they might talk and preach of Chri&s;t, yet Chri&s;t hated their doctrine.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t &s;aith to the Church of Smyrna, <Q>I know the bla&s;phemy of them which &s;ay they are Jews, and are not; but are of the &s;ynagogue of Satan.</Q> So the Church is to have a judgment upon the&s;e bla&s;phemers, and are to di&s;|tingui&s;h the Jews in the Spirit from &s;uch as are not, but of the &s;ynagogue of Satan.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="037441_0872_100D943F6E029468">
The Church in Pergamos Chri&s;t had a "few things again&s;t, becau&s;e," &s;aid he, "thou ha&s;t there them that hold the doctrines of Balaam, &amp;c. And al&s;o them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I hate." The&s;e that held the doctrine of Balaam, and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, were got into the church, and might look upon them&s;elves to be high Chri&s;tians, and take great liberty to go into Balaam's and Nicholas's doctrine, which was hated by Chri&s;t; but the church was to keep a &s;pirit|ual and divine judgment upon the heads of all the&s;e.</P>
<P>To the church of Thyatira, &s;aith Chri&s;t, <Q>I have a few things again&s;t thee, becau&s;e thou &s;uffere&s;t the woman Je|zebel to teach, which &s;educes my people,</Q> &amp;c. Here was a &s;uffering which &s;hould have been a judgment by Chri&s;t's Spirit upon that Jezebel which was erred from his Spirit, and &s;o from Chri&s;t. Such as the&s;e were high preachers. Is not the church to beware of &s;uffering &s;uch now, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould come under the reproof of Chri&s;t for not pa&s;&s;ing judgment again&s;t the fal&s;e teacher and &s;educer?</P>
<P>The church of Sardis "had a name to live, but was dead, and her works were not found perfect before God." There is a judgment to be &s;et up in the church, to judge all imperfect works, and &s;uch as would have a name, but not the nature; a name to live yet are dead. The living of every member of the true church mu&s;t be in Chri&s;t their life. The&s;e living members live to his name. This church had a few names, <Q>who had not de&s;iled their garments, that did walk in white;</Q> but &s;uch as have a name to live but are dead, whil&s;t they are in a dead &s;tate cannot walk in white, nor judge in divine matters. "Behold," &s;aid Chri&s;t, <Q>I will make them of the &s;ynagogue of Satan, which &s;ay they are Jews, but are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and to wor&s;hip before my feet.</Q></P>
<P>And to the church of Laodicea, that was "neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm; I would thou wert either hot or cold: I will &s;pew thee out of my mouth, becau&s;e thou &s;aid&s;t thou wa&s;t rich, and wanted nothing;" when they were "wretched, mi&s;erable, poor, blind, and naked." This was for want of living in the power and Spirit of Chri&s;t. The&s;e could talk of high experiences and great enjoyments, but were naked, mi&s;erable, and blind; &s;o lived not in the power, Spirit, light, and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, by which they might be clothed, and have the eternal riches. So the church of Chri&s;t had a &s;piritual
<PB N="357" REF="037441_0873_100D9441C683FFD0">judgment given to them that are faithful in his power and Spirit and light, to judge of temporal things and the things of this life, and to judge of eternal and divine things and &s;tates, and of angels and wicked men, and &s;uch as go from truth, and of the &s;tates of election and reprobation, yea and of the devils who are out of truth; the&s;e being in Chri&s;t Je&s;us who is the Fir&s;t and La&s;t, from whom they have the eternal judgment, to judge eternal, &s;piritual, and divine things; and in this word of power and wi&s;dom, by which all things were made and are upheld, to order all things to God's glory, and to judge of all things in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle judged, and &s;et up a judgment in the church, of gifts, of prophecies, of my&s;teries of faith, and of giving the body to be burned, and of giving goods to the poor, and of &s;peaking with tongues of men and angels; that yet, if they had not love, all this was nothing, but as a &s;ounding bra&s;s and tinkling cymbal. Therefore they are to be tried by the fruits of the good Spirit, which is love. The apo&s;tle not only judged him&s;elf in divine matters, but &s;et up a judgment in the church in tho&s;e &s;pi|ritual and divine matters.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle James judges of fountains and of fig-trees, of the wi&s;dom below, and of the wi&s;dom from above. and the fruits of both, James iii. And Paul judged in divine matters, when he &s;aid, <Q>The Spirit &s;poke expre&s;sly, that in the latter times &s;ome &s;hould depart from the faith,</Q> 1 Tim. iv. He judged in divine matters, when he judged all tho&s;e teachers that were high-minded, and had got the form of godline&s;s, but denied the power, and termed them like Jannes and Jamores, which with&s;tood Mo&s;es coming out of outward Egypt, as the&s;e with their form of godli|ne&s;s oppo&s;e Chri&s;t and his power that brings them out of &s;piritual Egypt now. Was not he a judge here in divine matters, who judged &s;uch as had gotten the form of godli|ne&s;s but denied the divine power? 2 Tim. iii.</P>
<P>When the apo&s;tle Paul &s;aid, "The prie&s;thood of Aaron was changed, and the law was changed, and the com|mandment di&s;annulled, that gave them their tithes," did not he judge in divine and &s;piritual matters? and was not the law &s;piritual, which &s;erved till the Seed came?</P>
<P>Did not the apo&s;tle judge in divine and &s;piritual mat|ters in the &s;ixth of the Hebrews, where he &s;aith, <Q>Let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of
<PB N="358" REF="037441_0874_100D9443E3BB7218">repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God, and of the doctrine of bapti&s;ms, and of laying on of hands, and of the re&s;urrection of the dead, and of eternal judg|ment: and this will we do, if God permit,</Q> &amp;c. and does not the apo&s;tle judge here, <Q>That it was impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who were once enlightened, and ta&s;ted of the hea|venly gift, and were partakers of the holy Gho&s;t, and had ta&s;ted of the good word of God, and of the power of the world to come, if they &s;hall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance, &s;eeing they crucify to them&s;elves the Son of God afre&s;h, and put him to open &s;hame?</Q> Heb. vi. Were not the&s;e &s;piritual, eternal, and divine matters and &s;tates that the apo&s;tle judged of? and have not the &s;aints the &s;ame judgment given unto them in the &s;ame &s;pirit? Have not the apo&s;tles and the church a &s;piritual judgment to judge of prophets, my&s;teries, faith, apo&s;tles, angels, world, and the devil? And is not this judgment given them of God in divine matters, be&s;ides the judgment giv|en them in matters pertaining unto this life?</P>
<P>And had not they judgment to di&s;cern the true go&s;pel from the fal&s;e? and all &s;uch as had a profe&s;&s;ion of the form, and did not live in the power? and &s;uch as &s;poke of the things of God, in the words that man's wi&s;dom did teach? which things of God were not to be &s;poken in the wi&s;dom which man's words taught; but in the word which the Holy Gho&s;t taught. Therefore did not the apo&s;tle exhort to know the power, and that their faith might &s;tand in the power of God? that the kingdom of God &s;tands not in word, but in power?</P>
<P>Had not all the prophets a judgment to judge in divine matters? as Jeremiah, when he judged the prophets; and Ezekiel judged all &s;uch as came with a pretence of the Word of the Lord, u&s;ing their tongues, and &s;aying, <Q>Thus &s;aith the Lord; when the Lord never &s;poke unto them.</Q> Jeremiah xxiii. Ezekiel xiii. and many other places might be in&s;tanced. Did he not judge Hananiah, who prophe&s;ied fal&s;ely? and did not this Hananiah pre|tend to &s;peak the word of the Lord to the prie&s;ts and people? Jeremiah xxviii.</P>
<P>Did not I&s;aiah judge in divine matters, when he judged the watchmen and the &s;hepherds? I&s;a. lvi. Did not Mi|cah judge in divine and &s;piritual matters, when he &s;aid he <Q>was full of the power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgment?</Q> Did not he judge of prie&s;ts, prophets, and
<PB N="359" REF="037441_0875_100D9445ED6D8828">judges, though they would lean upon the Lord, and &s;ay, Is not the Lord among&s;t us, and no evil can come unto us; yet did not he let them &s;ee their &s;tates and conditions, and "divided the precious from the vile?" Mich. iii. And &s;o the re&s;t of the prophets. You may &s;ee they judged for God in his divine matters, <Q>who &s;erved him, and who &s;erved him not; who lived in truth, and who not;</Q> and likewi&s;e the apo&s;tles. And this divine, &s;piritual, heavenly judgment was given of God to his holy men and women.</P>
<P>They that judge in God's divine matters, mu&s;t live in his divine Spirit, power, and light now, as they did then; which &s;piritual and divine judgment Chri&s;t has given to his Church, the living &s;tones, and living members, that make up his &s;piritual hou&s;ehold; to try Jews, apo&s;tles, and prophets; to try faiths and religions, trees and fruits, &s;hepherds and teachers, and to try &s;pirits. So the living members have a living divine judgment in the church of Chri&s;t, which he is the Head of, the judge of all.</P>
<P>Nay, the church has a power given them, which is far|ther than a judgment: for what they <Q>bind on earth, is bound in heaven by the power of God;</Q> and what they "loo&s;e on earth is loo&s;ed in heaven by the power of God." This power has Chri&s;t given to his living members, the church.</P>

<P>I returned to London in the fir&s;t month 1686, and &s;et my&s;elf with all diligence to look after friends &s;ufferings, which we had now &s;ome hopes of getting relief from. The &s;e&s;&s;ions came on in the &s;econd month at Hicks's Hall, where many friends had appeals to be tried; with whom I was from day to day to advi&s;e, and &s;ee that no opportunity was &s;lipt, nor advantage lo&s;t: and they generally &s;ucceeded well. Soon after, the king was plea&s;ed, upon our often laying our &s;ufferings before him, <Q>To give order for the relea&s;ing all that were impri&s;oned for con&s;cience-&s;ake; which were in his power to di&s;charge.</Q> Whereby the pri|&s;on-doors were opened, and many hundreds of friends, &s;ome of whom had been long in pri&s;on, were &s;et at liberty. Some of them, who had many years been re&s;trained in bonds, came up to the yearly meeting, which was in the third month this year. This cau&s;ed great joy to friends, to &s;ee

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY love is to you all in the holy Seed Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head, and de&s;troys the de|vil and his works; and who hath all power in heaven and earth given to him. Let every one's faith &s;tand in him, and in his power, who is the author and fini&s;her of your faith. To you who have been partakers of his power, and are &s;en&s;ible of it in this day of his power, which is over darkne&s;s and its power; by who&s;e power the hearts of the king and rulers have been opened; and by which your out|ward pri&s;on-doors have been &s;et open for your liberty. My de&s;ires are, that all may be pre&s;erved in humility and thankfulne&s;s, in the &s;en&s;e of the mercies of the Lord; and live in the peaceable truth that is over all: that ye may an&s;wer God's grace, and his light and Spirit in all; in a righteous, godly life and conver&s;ation. Let none be lift|ed up by their outward liberty, neither let any be ca&s;t down by &s;uffering for Chri&s;t's &s;ake; but all live in the &s;eed (which is as wheat) which is not &s;haken nor blown away by the winds and &s;torms, as the chaff is. Which Seed of life none below can make higher or lower: for the children of the Seed are the children of the everla&s;ting, unchangeable kingdom of Chri&s;t and God. In Chri&s;t Je&s;us, whom God hath given you for a &s;anctuary. God Almighty keep you, in whom ye have life everla&s;ting, and wi&s;dom from above, which is pure, peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits; that all may be exerci&s;ed in it, and may practi&s;e this wi&s;|dom in holy lives and conver&s;ations; that this wi&s;dom may be ju&s;tified of all her children, and they exerci&s;ed and pre&s;erved in it in this day of the power of Chri&s;t; in which all his people are made a willing people, to &s;erve and wor&s;hip God in righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s, in the Spi|rit and truth.</P>
<P>Let none abu&s;e the power of the Lord, nor grieve his Spirit, by which you are &s;ealed and kept to the day of &s;al|vation and redemption; but always exerci&s;e your&s;elves to

All &s;tudy to be approved unto God in innocency, virtue, &s;implicity, and faithfulne&s;s, labouring and &s;tudying to be quiet in the will of God. <Q>And what&s;oever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, giv|ing thanks to God the Father by him:</Q> That he, who is over all, may have the prai&s;e for all his mercies and ble&s;|&s;ings, with which he hath refre&s;hed his people, and by his eternal arm and power hath kept and pre&s;erved them to this day. Glory to his name over all forever, Amen! Chri&s;t has called you by his grace into one body, to him the holy head; therefore live in charity, and in the love of God, which is the bond of perfectne&s;s in his body; which love edifies the body of Chri&s;t: which body and all its members are knit together, and increa&s;ed with the increa&s;e of God, from whom they receive nouri&s;hment.

The unity of this holy Spirit is the bond of peace of all the living members of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, of which he is the &s;piritual head, rock, and foundation. In the mid&s;t of his church of living members Chri&s;t exerci&s;es his &s;piritual prophetical office, to open to them the my&s;teries of his kingdom. He is a &s;piritual bi&s;hop to over&s;ee them, that they do not go a&s;tray from the living God that made them; a &s;hepherd that feeds them with bread and water of life from heaven, and none is able to pluck his &s;heep out of his hands. He is a prie&s;t that died for them, &s;anctifieth them, and pre&s;ents them to God, who ruleth in their hearts by the divine faith, which he is the author and fini&s;her of. His living members prai&s;e God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in whom they have life and &s;alvation, who reconciles them to God, that they can &s;ay they have <Q>peace with God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</Q> and &s;o prai&s;e God through him that was dead and is alive, reigns over all, and liveth for everrnore, ble&s;&s;ed for ever, Hallelujah, Amen!</P>

<P>I remained mo&s;t part of this year it London, &s;ave that &s;ometimes I got to Bethnal-green for a night or two, &s;ome|times as far as Enfield and thereabouts among&s;t friends, and once or twice to Chi&s;wich, where an ancient friend had &s;et up a &s;chool for the educating of friends children; in all which places I found &s;ervice for the Lord. At London I &s;pent my time among&s;t friends, either in publick meetings, as the Lord drew me, or vi&s;iting &s;uch as were not well, and in looking after the &s;ufferings of friends. For though many were relea&s;ed out of pri&s;on, yet &s;ome remained pri&s;oners &s;till for tithes, &amp;c. and &s;ufferings of &s;everal &s;orts lay heavy on friends in many places. Yet ina&s;much as many who had been pri&s;oners were now &s;et at liberty; I felt a concern upon me that none might look too much at man, but might eye the Lord therein, from whom deliverance comes. Where|fore I wrote an epi&s;tle to friends, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Lord by his eternal power hath di&s;po&s;ed the heart of the king to open the pri&s;on-doors, by which about fifteen or &s;ixteen hundred are &s;et at liberty, and hath given a check to the informers, &s;o that in many places our meetings are pretty quiet. My de&s;ires are, that both liberty and &s;ufferings may be &s;anctified to his peo|ple, that friends may prize the mercies of the Lord in all things and to him be thankful, who &s;tilleth the raging waves of the &s;ea, allayeth the &s;torms and tempe&s;ts, and maketh a calm. Therefore it is good to tru&s;t in the Lord, and ca&s;t your care upon him who careth for you. For when ye were in gaols and pri&s;ons the Lord did by his eternal arm and power uphold you, and &s;anctified them to you; unto &s;ome he made them as a &s;anctuary and tried his people as in a furnace of affliction, both in pri|&s;ons and &s;poiling of goods. In all this the Lord wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">with
<PB N="363" REF="037441_0879_100D944E353A4FF0">his people, and taught them to know that <Q>the earth is the Lord's, and the fulne&s;s thereof;</Q> and that he was in all places, "who crowneth the year with his goodne&s;s," P&s;al. lxv. Therefore let all God's people be diligent, and careful to keep the camp of God holy, pure, and clean, and to &s;erve God and Chri&s;t, and one another in the glorious, peaceable go&s;pel of life and &s;alvation; which glory &s;hines over God's camp, and his great Prophet, Bi|&s;hop and Shepherd is among, or in the mid&s;t of them, exerci&s;ing his heavenly offices in them; &s;o that you his people may rejoice in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, through whom you have peace with God. For he that de&s;troyeth the devil and his works, and brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head, is all God's people's heavenly foundation and rock to build upon; which was the holy prophets and apo&s;tles rock in days pa&s;t, and is now the rock of our age; which rock, the foundation of God, &s;tandeth &s;ure. Upon this the <Q>Lord God e&s;tabli&s;h all his people,</Q> Amen.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends and brethren in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN whom ye have all peace and life, in whom there is no divi&s;ion, &s;chi&s;m, rent, &s;trife, nor &s;eparation: for Chri&s;t is not divided, and there can be no &s;eparation in the truth, nor in the light, grace, faith, and Holy Gho&s;t, but unity, fellow&s;hip, and communion. For the devil was the fir&s;t that went out of the truth, &s;eparated from it, and tempted man and woman to di&s;obey God, and to go from the truth into a fal&s;e liberty, to do that which God forbad. So it is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pent now that leads men and women into a fal&s;e libe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, even the God of the world, from which man and woman mu&s;t be &s;eparated by the truth, that Chri&s;t the truth may make them free, and then they are free<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">deed. Then they are to &s;tand fa&s;t in that liberty in which Chri&s;t hath made them free, and in him there is no divi&s;ion, &s;chi&s;m, rent, nor &s;eparation; but peace, life, and
<PB N="364" REF="037441_0880_100D945067312078">reconciliation to God and to one another. So in Chri&s;t male and female are all one; for whether they be male or female, Jew or Gentile, bond or free, they are all one in Chri&s;t. And there can be no &s;chi&s;m, rent, or divi&s;ion in him, nor in the wor&s;hip of God in his holy Spirit and truth, nor in the pure and undefiled religion that keeps from the &s;pots of the world, nor in the love of God that beareth and endureth all things, nor in the word of God's grace, for it is pure and endureth for ever. Many, you &s;ee, have lo&s;t the word of patience, and the word of wi&s;|dom, that is pure, peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be in|treated. Then they run into the wi&s;dom that is below, that is "earthly, &s;en&s;ual, and devili&s;h," and very unea&s;y to be intreated. They go from the love of God that beareth all things, endureth all things, thinks no evil, and doth not behave it&s;elf un&s;eemly; them they cannot bear, but grow brittle, are ea&s;ily provoked, run into un&s;eemly things, and are in that, that vaunteth it&s;elf, are puffed up, ra&s;h, heady, high-minded, and fierce, and become as &s;ound|ing bra&s;s or a tinkling cymbal; but this is contrary to the nature of the love of God. Therefore, dear friends and bre|thren, dwell in the love of God; for tho&s;e who dwell in love dwell in God, and God in them. Keep in the word of wi&s;|dom, that is gentle, pure, and peaceable: and in the word of patience that endureth and beareth all things; which word of patience the devil, and the world, and all his in|&s;truments can never wear out: it will wear them all out; for it was before they were, and will be when they are gone, the pure, holy word of God, by which all God's children are born again, and feed on the milk thereof, and live and grow by it. My de&s;ires are, that ye may all be of one heart, mind, &s;oul, and &s;pirit in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, Amen.</P>

<P>A little after it came upon me to write &s;omething con|cerning the &s;tate of the church and the true members there|of; as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Concerning the church of Chri&s;t being clothed with the &s;un and having the moon under her feet.</P>
<P>THEY are living members, living &s;tones, built up a &s;piritual hou&s;ehold, the children of the promi&s;e, and
<PB N="366" REF="037441_0882_100D9454D97885E8">of the &s;eed and fle&s;h of Chri&s;t; as the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>fle&s;h of his fle&s;h, and bone of his bone.</Q> They are the good &s;eed, the children of the everla&s;ting kingdom written in heaven, who have put on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. They &s;it together in heavenly places in Chri&s;t, are clothed with the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and have the moon under their feet, Revel. xii. So all changeable things that are in the world, all changeable religions changeable wor&s;hips, changeable ways, fellow&s;hips, churches, and teachers in the world, are as the moon; for the moon changes, but the &s;un doth not change. The Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s never changeth, or &s;ets, nor goes down; but all the ways, religions, wor&s;hips, fellow&s;hips of the world, and the teachers thereof, change like the moon. But the true church, which Chri&s;t is the head of, which is in God the Father, and is called "the pillar and ground of truth," who&s;e conver&s;ation is in heaven; this church is clothed with the Sun, Chri&s;t Je&s;us her head, who doth not change, and hath all changeable things under her feet. The&s;e are the living members, born again of the immortal &s;eed by the word of God, who feed upon the immortal milk, and live and grow by it. Such are the new creatures in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who makes all things new, and &s;ees the old things pa&s;s away. His church, his members, which are cloth|ed with the &s;un, their wor&s;hip is in the Spirit and in the truth, which doth not change, which truth the devil, the foul, unclean &s;pirit, is out of, and cannot get into this wor&s;hip in Spirit and truth. Their religion is pure and undefiled before God, that keeps from the &s;pots of the world, and their way is the new and living way, Chri&s;t Je&s;us. So the church of Chri&s;t, that is clothed with the Sun, that hath the moon and all changeable religions and ways under her feet, hath an unchangeable wor&s;hip, reli|gion and way, an unchangeable rock and foundation, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, an unchangeable high prie&s;t, and &s;o are children of the New Te&s;tament, and in the everla&s;ting co|venant of light and life.</P>
<P>All that pro&s;e&s;s the &s;criptures both of the New and Old Te&s;tament, and are not in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the apo&s;tle tells them they are "reprobates if Chri&s;t be not in them." The&s;e that are not in Chri&s;t cannot be clothed with Chri&s;t, the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, that never changes. They are under the changeable moon in the world, in the changeable things, the changeable religions, ways, wor|&s;hips,
<PB N="367" REF="037441_0883_100D945817677098">teachers, rocks, and foundations. But Chri&s;t, the Son of God and Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, doth not change; in whom his people are gathered, and &s;it together in hea|venly places in him, clothed with Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Sun, who is the mountain that filleth the whole earth with his divine power and light. So all his people &s;ee him and feel him both by &s;ea and land. He is in all places of the earth felt and &s;een of all his. He &s;aith to the outward profe&s;&s;ors, the Jews, <Q>I am from above, ye are from be|low, ye are of this world.</Q> So their religions, wor&s;hips, ways, teachers, faiths, beliefs, and creeds, are made by men, and are below, of this world that changeth like the moon. You may &s;ee their religions, ways, wor&s;hips, and teachers, are all changeable like the moon; but Chri&s;t, the Sun, with which the church is clothed, doth not change, nor his church; for they are &s;piritually-minded, and their way, wor&s;hip, and religion is &s;piritual, from Chri&s;t, who is from above and not of this world. Chri&s;t hath redeem|ed you from this world, their changeable rudiments and elements, and old things, and their changeable teachers, and from their changeable faiths and beliefs. For Chri&s;t is the Author and Fini&s;her of his church's faith, who &s;aith, <Q>Believe in the Light, that ye may become children of the Light.</Q> And it is given them not only to believe, but to &s;uffer for his name. So this faith and belief is above all faiths and beliefs, which change like the moon. God's people are an holy nation, a peculiar people, a &s;piritual hou&s;ehold, and royal prie&s;thood, offering up &s;piritual &s;a|crifice to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and are zealous of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, godly, good works, and their zeal is for that which is of God again&s;t the evil which is not of God. Chri&s;t took upon him the &s;eed of Abraham, he doth not &s;ay the corrupt &s;eed of the Gentiles; &s;o according to the fle&s;h he was of the holy &s;eed of Abraham and David, and his holy body and blood was an offering and a &s;acrifice for the &s;ins of the whole world, as a lamb without blemi&s;h, who&s;e fle&s;h &s;aw no corruption. By the one offering of him&s;elf in the New Te&s;tament or New Covenant, he has put an end to all the offering and &s;acrifices among&s;t the Jews in the Old Te&s;tament. Chri&s;t, the holy Seed, was crucified, dead, and buried according to the fle&s;h, and rai&s;ed again the third day, and his fle&s;h &s;aw no corruption. Though he was crucified in the fle&s;h, yet quickened again by the Spirit and is alive, and liveth for evermore, and hath all
<PB N="368" REF="037441_0884_100D9459A8FBF568">power in heaven and earth given to him, and reigneth over all, and is the One Mediator between God and Man, even the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Chri&s;t &s;aid, <Q>He gave his fle&s;h for the life of the world;</Q> and the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>his fle&s;h &s;aw no corruption;</Q> &s;o that which &s;aw no corruption he gave for the life of the corrupt world to bring them out of corruption. Chri&s;t &s;aid again, <Q>He that eateth my fle&s;h and drinketh my blood hath eternal life; for my fle&s;h is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. And he that eateth my fle&s;h, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</Q> He that eats not his fle&s;h and drinks not his blood, which is the life of the fle&s;h, hath not eter|nal life. As the apo&s;tle &s;aith, "All died in Adam;" then all are dead. Now all coming &s;piritually to eat the fle&s;h of Chri&s;t, the &s;econd Adam, and drink his blood, his blood and fle&s;h gives all the dead in Adam life, and quick|ens them out of their &s;ins and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es in which they were dead; &s;o they come to fit together in the heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and are living members of the church of Chri&s;t that he is the head of, and are clothed with the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the Son of God, that never changes, and have the changeable moon under their feet, and all changeable worldly things, inventions, and works of men's hands. The&s;e &s;ee the people how they change from one wor&s;hip to another, from one religion to another, from one way to another, and one church to another, yet their hearts are not changed. The letter of the &s;cripture is read by the Chri&s;tians like the Jews, but the my&s;tery is hid; they have the &s;heep's clothing, the out&s;ide, but are in|wardly ravened from the Spirit, which &s;hould bring them into the Lamb's and Sheep's nature. The &s;cripture &s;aith, "All the uncircumci&s;ed mu&s;t go down into the pit;" there|fore all mu&s;t be circumci&s;ed with the Spirit of God, which puts off the body of death and &s;ins of the fle&s;h, that came into man and woman by their di&s;obedience and tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ing God's commands. I &s;ay, all mu&s;t be circumci&s;ed with the Spirit, which puts off the body of death and &s;ins of the fle&s;h, before they come up into Chri&s;t, their Re&s;t, that never fell, and be clothed with him the Sun of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

<PB N="369" REF="037441_0885_100D945C10B00C88">concerning the 'falling away,' foretold by the apo&s;tle Paul, 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 3. as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE apo&s;tle &s;aith that there mu&s;t be "a falling away" fir&s;t before the wicked one, and man of &s;in, the &s;on of perdition, be revealed, which betrayeth Chri&s;t within, as the &s;on of perdition betrayed Chri&s;t without; and they that betray Chri&s;t within crucify to them&s;elves Chri&s;t afre&s;h, and put him to open &s;hame. Before the apo&s;tles decea&s;ed, this man of &s;in and &s;on of perdition was reveal|ed; for they &s;aw antichri&s;t come, the fal&s;e prophets, fal&s;e apo&s;tles, and deceivers come, having a form of godline&s;s, but denying the power thereof. They &s;aw the wolves dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;heep's clothing, and &s;uch as went in Cain's, Corah's, and Balaam's way, and Jezebel's, and the whore of Babylon, the whore of confu&s;ion, the mother of harlots, and &s;uch as were enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, that &s;erv|ed not the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t but their own bellies. The&s;e Chri&s;t &s;aw &s;hould come, and &s;aid, <Q>If it were po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould deceive the elect,</Q> and commanded his fol|lowers not to go after them. The apo&s;tle &s;aid, <Q>Turn away from &s;uch,</Q> and Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles warned the church of Chri&s;t of &s;uch. In this day of Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel, after the long night of apo&s;tacy from the light, grace, truth, life, and Spirit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the &s;on of perdition, the wicked one, the man of &s;in is revealed again, and the inwardly ravening wolves in &s;heep's clothing, and the &s;pirit of Cain, Corah, Balaam, Jezebel, the antichri&s;ts, fal&s;e prophets, and fal&s;e apo&s;tles, and &s;uch as are enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, who &s;erve not the Lord Je&s;us, but their own bellies, and crucify Chri&s;t to them&s;elves, and put him to open &s;hame. This &s;pirit have we &s;een in this go&s;pel-day of Chri&s;t; but Chri&s;t will con&s;ume them with the Spirit of his mouth, and de&s;troy them with the bright|ne&s;s of his coming. But God's people, whom he hath cho&s;en unto &s;alvation in Chri&s;t from the beginning, through the &s;anctification of the Spirit and the belief of the truth, &s;tand &s;teadfa&s;t in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and are thankful to God by and through his Son, their rock and &s;alvation, their happine&s;s, and eternal inheritance.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>Ye were as &s;heep going a&s;tray, but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of your Souls.</Q> So when people are returned to Chri&s;t, their Shepherd, they know his voice and follow him, and are
<PB N="370" REF="037441_0886_100D945E357B8B28">returned to the Bi&s;hop of their Souls; then they believe in him and receive wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding from him who is from above, heavenly and &s;piritual. Then they act like &s;piritual holy men and women, and come to be members of the Church of Chri&s;t. Then a &s;piritual care cometh upon the elders in Chri&s;t, that all the members walk in Chri&s;t, in his light, grace, Spirit, and truth, that they may adorn the confe&s;&s;ion and profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and &s;ee that all walk in the order of the holy Spirit, and the everla&s;ting go&s;pel of peace, life, and &s;alvation. This order keeps out of confu&s;ion; for the go&s;pel of peace, the power of God, was before confu&s;ion was. All the heirs of the go&s;pel are heirs of its order, and are in this go&s;pel which brings life and immortality to light in them, by which all men and women may &s;ee their work and &s;ervice in it, to look after the poor widows and fatherle&s;s, to &s;ee that nothing be lacking, and that all honour the Lord in their lives and conver&s;ations.</P>
<P>When the whole hou&s;e of I&s;rael were in their graves and &s;epulchres, and were called "the &s;cattered, dry bones," yet they could &s;peak, and &s;ay <Q>their bones were dry, their hope was lo&s;t. or they were without hope, and they were cut off.</Q> They were alive outwardly, and could &s;peak outwardly. So that which is called Chri&s;tendom may very well be called "the &s;cattered dry bones," and be &s;aid to be in their graves and &s;epulchres, dead from the hea|venly breath of life, the Spirit and word of life, that ga|thereth to God. Though they can &s;peak, and are alive outwardly, yet they remain in the congregations or churches of the dead, that want the virtue of life. For the Jews, whom God poured his Spirit upon and gave them his law, when they rebelled again&s;t the Spirit of God. and turned from God and his law, they came to be dry &s;cattered bones, and were turned into their graves and &s;epulchres. So Chri&s;tendom that is turned from the grace, truth, and light of Chri&s;t, and the Spirit that God poureth upon all fle&s;h, they are become the &s;cattered dry bones, are in their graves and &s;epulchres, and are the congrega|tions or churches of the dead, though they can &s;peak and are alive outwardly.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. He gave his fle&s;h for the life of the world.</Q> And he &s;aith, <Q>I am the re&s;urrection and the life. I am the way, the truth, and
<PB N="371" REF="037441_0887_100D9460D7B127B0">the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me.</Q> Chri&s;t is the quickening Spirit. All being dead in Adam are to be quickened and made alive by Chri&s;t, the &s;econd Adam. And when they are quickened and made alive by him, they meet together in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t their Saviour, who died for their &s;ins and is ri&s;en for their ju&s;|tification, and &s;o was dead and is alive, and liveth for evermore. All whom he hath quickened and made alive (even all the living) meet in the name of Je&s;us who is alive, and he their living Prophet, Shepherd, and Bi&s;hop is in the mid&s;t of them, and is their living Rock and Foundation, and a living Mediator between them and the living God. So the living prai&s;e the living God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, through whom they have peace with God. All the living have re&s;t in Chri&s;t their life, he is their &s;anctification, their righteou&s;ne&s;s, their trea&s;ure of wi&s;dom, knowledge, and under&s;tanding, which is &s;piritual and hea|venly. He is the &s;piritual tree and root, which all the believers in the light, the life in Chri&s;t, that pa&s;s from the death in Adam to the life in Chri&s;t, and overcome the world, and are born of God, are grafted into Chri&s;t, the heavenly tree, which beareth all the &s;piritual branches or grafts. The&s;e meet in his name, are gathered in him, and &s;it together in heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, their Life, who hath quickened and made them alive. So all the living wor&s;hip the living God in his holy Spirit and truth, in which they live and walk. Into this wor&s;hip the &s;oul, unclean &s;pirit, the devil, cannot get; for the holy Spirit and truth is over him, and he is out of it. This is the &s;tanding wor&s;hip which Chri&s;t &s;et up in his new covenant. And they that are quickened by Chri&s;t are the living &s;tones, living members, and &s;piritual hou&s;ehold and church, or congregation of Chri&s;t, who is the living head and hu&s;band. They that are made alive by Chri&s;t are a living church, have a living head, and are come from the congregations or churches of the dead in Adam, where death and de&s;truction talk of God, and of his prophets and apo&s;tles, in their wi&s;dom that is below, earthly, and devili&s;h, in the knowledge that is bruti&s;h, and in the un|der&s;tanding that comes to nought. For what they know is natural, by their natural tongues, arts, and &s;ciences, in which they corrupt them&s;elves. This is the &s;tate of the

<P>While I was at King&s;ton, I wrote another paper, &s;hew|ing, <Q>That the Lord in all ages called the righteous from among&s;t the wicked, before he de&s;troyed them;</Q> after this manner:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>NOAH and his family were called into the ark, before the old world was de&s;troyed with the flood. And all the faithful generation, that lived before, were taken away, and died in the faith, before that flood of de&s;truction came upon the wicked old world.</P>
<P>The Lord did call Lot out of Sodom, before he did de&s;troy and con&s;ume it, and the wicked there.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t &s;aid; <Q>It cannot be, that a prophet peri&s;h out of Jeru&s;alem;</Q> and he &s;aid; <Q>O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, which kille&s;t the prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them that are &s;ent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings! but ye would not,</Q> Luke xiii. 33, 34. And he &s;aid to the Jews; "Therefore al&s;o &s;aid the wi&s;dom of God, <Q>I will &s;end them prophets and apo&s;tles, and &s;ome of them they &s;hall &s;lay and per&s;ecute; that the blood of all the pro|phets, which was &s;hed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; from the blood of Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias, which peri&s;hed be|tween the altar and the temple. Verily, I &s;ay unto you, it &s;hall be required of this generation,</Q> Luke xi. 49, 50, 51. And he &s;aid to the Jews, <Q>Behold, your hou&s;es &s;hall be left unto you de&s;olate,</Q> Matth. xxiii. 34, &amp;c. Chri&s;t told his di&s;ciples, that the temple at Jeru&s;alem &s;hould be thrown down, and there &s;hould not be one &s;tone left upon another, that &s;hould not be thrown down, Matth. xxiv. 2. Al&s;o, that he mu&s;t go to Jeru&s;alem, and <Q>&s;uffer many things of the Jews, elders, and chief prie&s;ts, and be killed, and rai&s;ed again the third day,</Q> Matth. xvi. 21. And Chri&s;t &s;aid, <Q>When ye &s;hall &s;ee Jeru&s;alem compa&s;&s;ed with armies, then know, the de&s;olation there|of is nigh.</Q> He foretold, that the Jews &s;hould fall by the edge of the &s;word, and &s;hould be led away <Q>captive into
<PB N="373" REF="037441_0889_100D9464039F2B78">all nations; and Jeru&s;alem &s;hould be trodden down of the Gentiles,</Q> Luke xxi. 20, 24. Here you may &s;ee how Jeru&s;alem was often warned by Chri&s;t, and how often he would have "gathered them, but they would not," be|fore they were &s;cattered over or into all nations, their hou|&s;es left de&s;olate, and their temple and Jeru&s;alem be&s;ieged with armies, de&s;troyed, and thrown down. And though the di&s;ciples and apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t did meet, with the el|ders and church at Jeru&s;alem, after Chri&s;t was ri&s;en, yet Eu&s;ebius reporteth in his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, that the Chri&s;tians at Jeru&s;alem had a vi&s;ion, or a revelation to de|part out of Jeru&s;alem. Being forewarned al&s;o by Chri&s;t, that <Q>when they &s;hould &s;ee Jeru&s;alem compa&s;&s;ed with ar|mies, its de&s;olation was nigh; and that the temple &s;hould be thrown down, and not one &s;tone left upon another;</Q> it is &s;aid, the Chri&s;tians did depart out of bloody Jeru&s;alem, before it and the temple were de&s;troyed by Titus the em|peror, who be&s;ieged it with his armies. He was of the Gentiles, and de&s;troyed the temple and Jeru&s;alem, as Chri&s;t had fore&s;poken to his di&s;ciples, becau&s;e of the wick|edne&s;s of the Jews, and the innocent blood that they had &s;hed in it. So the Lord called his people out of bloody Jeru&s;alem, before he de&s;troyed it. And it is &s;aid, Ti|tus de&s;troyed the temple and Jeru&s;alem about two-and-for|ty years after Chri&s;t was crucified and ri&s;en again, and that with &s;o great a de&s;truction, that the Jews never did build again the city of Jeru&s;alem, nor the temple (as Sodom was never built again, nor the cities of the old world). But the Jews for above the&s;e thou&s;and years have been, and are a &s;cattered people in all nations to this day; and Chri&s;t (whom they crucified) and his doctrine is preached, and &s;et over them: and the Gentiles, whom they hated, have received and do receive him and his doctrine, and prai&s;e God for it through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Amen.</P>
<P>God called his people out of Egypt, after he had pour|ed out his ten plagues upon the Egyptians; when he had de&s;troyed the fir&s;t-born of Egypt, then the Lord brought his people out of Egypt. And after the Lord had clearly brought his people out, he de&s;troyed Pharaoh, with all his ho&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and chariots.</P>
<P>John &s;aith, he heard a voice, &s;aying; <Q>Come out of her, my people (to wit, out of Babylon, the fal&s;e church) that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: for her &s;ins have reached to

<P>Was not Nebuchadnezzar's empire thrown down and ended by Cyrus and Darius, who were of the &s;eed of the Medes, before Cyrus and Darius gave forth their procla|mation for all the Jews to go into their own land out of Babylon's captivity? and was there not a prophecy of Cy|rus, <Q>That he &s;hould &s;ubdue nations, and that the Lord would loo&s;e the loins of kings before him, and break in pieces the gates of bra&s;s, and cut in &s;under the bars of iron, and open the two-leaved gates; and that the gates &s;hould not be &s;hut?</Q> And the Lord &s;aid; <Q>This is for Jacob, my &s;ervant's &s;ake, and for I&s;rael mine elect,</Q> I&s;a. xlv. Was not this fulfilled in Cyrus's and Darius's time? For did not then the Jews go out of captivity into their own land? Ezra i. 2, 3, 4, and chap. vi. 1. and 12. and I&s;a. xliv. 28. and xlv. 13. Was not this prophecy of I&s;aiah fulfilled, when the children of I&s;rael came out of Babylon? Were not the A&s;&s;yrians, that carried away the ten tribes &s;ubdued? and the Babylonians, that carried away the two tribes, were they not &s;ubdued in the days of Cyrus and Darius, in who&s;e days the <Q>loins of kings were loo&s;ed, and the two-leaved gates of bra&s;s and iron were opened?</Q> and had not I&s;rael and Jacob their liberty by them in their days, to go into their own Land?</P>

While I was at King&s;ton, one day meditating on the things of God, &s;ome particular ob&s;ervations aro&s;e in my mind concerning the fir&s;t, and the '&s;econd or la&s;t Adam. As that&mdash;</P>
<P>The fir&s;t man Adam was made on the &s;ixth day of the week; and Chri&s;t, the &s;econd Adam, was crucified on the &s;ixth day of the Week.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Adam was betrayed by the &s;erpent in the gar|den of Eden: Chri&s;t our Saviour, the &s;econd Adam, was betrayed by Judas in a garden near Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t aro&s;e from the dead on the fir&s;t-day of the week; and they that do believe on him are entered into Chri&s;t their re&s;t: the chri&s;tians meet together to wor&s;hip God on the fir&s;t day of the week; and on the fir&s;t day of the week it was, that God &s;aid, <Q>Let there be light, and there was light.</Q> The Jews reft was on the &s;eventh day of the week, which was given to them as a &s;ign of the eternal re&s;t of the Lord, &s;anctifying them, after they came out of the land of Egypt: for before that time the Lord had not giv|en to man and woman his outward Sabbath-day to keep, neither in the old world, nor after in Abraham's time, nor in I&s;aac's, nor in Jacob's time; until the Jews came out of Egypt to Mount Sinai in the wilderne&s;s. Then the Lord gave the law, and his Sabbath, as a &s;ign in the old covenant, of Chri&s;t the eternal re&s;t in the new cove|nant: and they that believe do enter into Chri&s;t their re&s;t.</P>
<P>Adam, the fir&s;t man, is the root from whence we all &s;pring naturally: and Chri&s;t is called the la&s;t or &s;econd Adam, becau&s;e he is the beginning and root of all that are &s;piritual.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Adam was made a living &s;oul: and Chri&s;t the la&s;t Adam is a quickening &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t by the grace of God ta&s;ted death for every man, that they might all come into favour with God; and that every tongue &s;hould confe&s;s, that <Q>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</Q></P>
<P>I wrote al&s;o a paper there, concerning the two &s;eeds, di&s;|tingui&s;hing the &s;eed wherein the ble&s;&s;ing is received, from the &s;eed which the cur&s;e remains upon. Of which the fol|lowing is a copy:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE Lord &s;aid to Abraham, <Q>In thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed,</Q> Gen. xxii. 18.
<PB N="376" REF="037441_0892_100D946B94141360"><Q>And thy &s;eed &s;hall be as the &s;tars of heaven, and as the &s;and which is upon the &s;ea-&s;hore, and as the du&s;t of the earth, that cannot be numbered,</Q> chap. xiii. 16. and xv. 5. and xxii. 17. In this &s;eed all nations and families of the earth are ble&s;&s;ed; but not in the &s;eed of evil-doers and of fal&s;ehood, nor in the &s;eed of adultery and the whore, I&s;a. i. 4. and lvii. 3, 4. <Q>For the &s;eed of the wicked &s;hall be cut off, &s;aith the Lord,</Q> P&s;al. xxxvii. 28. The Lord &s;aid to David, "That his &s;eed &s;hould endure for ever," P&s;al. lxxxix. 36. And again it is &s;aid, P&s;al. cii. 28. <Q>The children of thy &s;ervants &s;hall continue, and their &s;eed &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed before thee.</Q> Here is a di&s;tinction betwixt the two &s;eeds: for the &s;eed of evil-doers, of the adulterer, whore, and of the wicked &s;hall be cut off; &s;o it is not ble&s;&s;ed. But Chri&s;t brui&s;es the head of the &s;erpent and his &s;eed, which he &s;oweth in them, that di&s;obey and tran&s;gre&s;s God's command, and rebel again&s;t Gods good Spirit. This wicked &s;eed of the &s;erpent is cur&s;t, and is an enemy to the &s;eed, in whom all are ble&s;&s;ed. But Chri&s;t brui&s;es the head of this cur&s;ed &s;eed of enmity, and de&s;troys the devil and his works; and in his &s;eed are all ble&s;&s;ed, and all are in unity in this &s;eed. All the children of the &s;eed are the children of the kingdom of God and Chri&s;t, and are ble&s;&s;ed with faithful Abraham. Whoever are of the &s;aving, divine, precious faith, are of Abraham, walk in the &s;teps of the &s;eed and faith of Abraham, and are ble&s;|&s;ed with him, yea, of all nations, and all the families of the earth.</P>
<P>The Lord &s;aid to Abraham, "Thy &s;eed &s;hall be a &s;tranger in a land that is not theirs, and &s;hall &s;erve them; and they &s;hall afflict them four hundred years: and that nation, whom they &s;hall &s;erve, will I judge; and after|wards &s;hall they (to wit, Gods &s;eed) come out with great &s;ub&s;tance," Gen. xv. 13, 14. Here ye may &s;ee, that which afflicts God's &s;eed, he will judge, and did judge; for he did de&s;troy the fir&s;t-birth of Pharaoh, and over|threw him and his ho&s;t.</P>
<P>An holy man &s;aid; "Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a &s;eed or remnant, we had been as Sodom," &amp;c. that is de&s;troyed. But in the &s;eed, which de&s;troys the devil and his works, and brui&s;es the head of the &s;erpent and his &s;eed, are all nations and families of the earth ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t, according to the fle&s;h, was of Abraham and of
<PB N="377" REF="037441_0893_100D946D29CADE28">David: for he took not on him the nature of angels, but the &s;eed of Abraham; in which &s;eed all nations and families of the earth are ble&s;&s;ed. And &s;o they, that are of his &s;eed, are of the generation of Chri&s;t; are <Q>fle&s;h of his fle&s;h, and bone of his bone.</Q>&mdash;Now all nations and fami|lies of the earth mu&s;t be in this holy &s;eed, if they have the ble&s;&s;ings, and are ble&s;&s;ed. And, <Q>out of the mouth of this &s;eed's &s;eed &s;hall not God's word depart;</Q> but &s;hall remain and abide in the mouth of this &s;eed's &s;eed, in which they are ble&s;&s;ed, I&s;a. lix. 21. So it is not the fir&s;t-birth's talking of the words of Chri&s;t, the &s;eed, in who&s;e mouth the word of God doth not abide, that makes an outward profe&s;&s;ion, like the Jews, that did kill and per&s;ecute the prophets, and crucify Chri&s;t the &s;eed and &s;ub&s;tance of the law and prophets, which the Jews profe&s;&s;ed in words, but they denied Chri&s;t, the &s;eed and life. All Chri&s;tians (&s;o called) that profe&s;s the &s;criptures in words, and are not in the &s;eed Chri&s;t, are in the confu&s;ion, and are like the Jews. So neither Jews nor Chri&s;tians are ble&s;&s;ed, except they be in Chri&s;t, the &s;eed of life.</P>
<P>But though Chri&s;t is &s;aid to be the &s;eed of David, and of Abraham, as his generation is declared by Matthew and Luke; yet Chri&s;t was not born of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God. For he was con|ceived by the Holy Gho&s;t, born of the Virgin, and &s;up|po&s;ed to be the &s;on of Jo&s;eph, but was the &s;on of God. His name was called Je&s;us, becau&s;e he &s;hould <Q>&s;ave his people from their &s;ins;</Q> and Emanuel, God with us. Chri&s;t took not upon him the nature of angels, but the &s;eed of Abraham (as I &s;aid before) and &s;o was made of the &s;eed of David according to the fle&s;h, and <Q>declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the &s;pirit of holine&s;s, by the re&s;urrection from the dead,</Q> Rom. i. 4. So the generation of Chri&s;t is a my&s;tery. Chri&s;t &s;aw his &s;eed or word grow up in his di&s;ciples; and <Q>Chri&s;t in you the hope of glory,</Q> the apo&s;tle calls <Q>the my&s;tery, which hath been hid from ages and generations; but now is made manife&s;t to the &s;aints, or &s;anctified ones,</Q> Col. i. 26, 27. <Q>Whom we preach; warning every man, and teaching every man in all wi&s;dom, that we may pre&s;ent every man perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</Q> v. 28. For in Chri&s;t, the &s;econd Adam, all are made perfect and complete; and in Adam in the fall, all are deformed and made imperfect; &s;o out of Chri&s;t all mankind are imperfect and deformed;

But the apo&s;tle tells the church of Chri&s;t, <Q>Ye are complete in Chri&s;t, which is the head of all principality and power,</Q> Col. ii. 10. (for he hath <Q>all power in heaven and earth giver to him,</Q> Matth. xxviii. 18.) So all the &s;aints are made perfect and complete in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God over all for ever, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Amen, Amer</P>

<P>Quickly after this I returned to London, and continued there a month in the &s;ervice of the Lord; being daily exer|ci&s;ed either in public meetings, or more particular &s;ervices relating to the church of Chri&s;t: as vi&s;iting &s;uch as were &s;ick or afflicted, writing books or papers for the &s;preading of truth, or re&s;uting of error. As it was a time of general liberty, the Papi&s;ts appeared more open in their wor&s;hip than formerly, and many un&s;ettled people going to view them, a great talk there was of their praying to &s;aints, and by beads, &amp;c. whereupon I wrote a &s;hort paper concern|ing prayer; as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>CHRIST Je&s;us, when he taught his di&s;ciples to pray, &s;aid unto them, <Q>When ye pray, &s;ay; Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,</Q> &amp;c. Chri&s;t doth not &s;ay, they &s;hould pray to Mary, the mother of Chri&s;t; nor doth he &s;ay, they &s;hould pray to angels, or to &s;aints that were dead. Chri&s;t did not teach them to pray to the dead, nor for the dead. Neither did Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles teach the believers to pray by beads, nor to &s;ing by outward organs; but the apo&s;tle &s;aid, he would &s;ing and pray in the &s;pirit: for the Spirit it&s;elf <Q>maketh inter|ce&s;&s;ion; and the Lord, that &s;earcheth the heart, knoweth the mind of the &s;pirit.</Q></P>
<P>To take coun&s;el of the dead, was forbidden by the law of God; they were to take coun&s;el of the Lord. He hath given Chri&s;t in the new covenant, in his go&s;pel-day, to be a coun&s;ellor and a leader to all believers in his light. Men are not to run to the dead for the living; for the law
<PB N="379" REF="037441_0895_100D94720A218950">and te&s;timony of God forbids it. Tho&s;e Jews, that refu&s;|ed the running waters of Shiloh, the floods and waters of the A&s;&s;yrians and Babylonians came over them, and car|ried them into captivity: and they that refu&s;e the waters of Chri&s;t are overflowed with the flood of the world, that lieth in wickedne&s;s. They that a&s;ked coun&s;el of &s;tocks and &s;tones, were in the &s;pirit of error and whoredom; they were "gone a whoring from God," Ho&s;ea iv. 12. And they, that "joined them&s;elves to Baal-Peor, and ate the &s;acrifices of the dead, provoked the Lord's anger, and brought the Lord's di&s;plea&s;ure upon them," P&s;al. cvi. 28, 29. So here ye may &s;ee, the &s;acrifices of the dead were forbidden. The living know that they &s;hall die; but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward: for the memory of them is forgotten, Ec|cle&s;. ix. 5. "Wo to the rebellious children, &s;aith the Lord, that take coun&s;el, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my &s;pirit, that they may add &s;in to &s;in," I&s;a. xxx. 1.</P>

<P>When I had &s;taid about a month in London, I got out of town again: For by rea&s;on of the many hard&s;hips I had undergone in impri&s;onments, and other &s;ufferings for truth's &s;ake, my body was grown &s;o infirm and weak, that I could not bear the clo&s;ene&s;s of the city long together; but was fain to go a little into the country, where I might have the be|nefit of the fre&s;h air. At this time I went with my &s;on-in|law William Mead, to his country-hou&s;e called Goo&s;es in E&s;&s;ex, where I &s;taid about two weeks; and among other &s;ervices, that I had there, I wrote the following paper:</P>

<HEAD>A Di&s;tinction between the true offering and &s;acrifice, and "the fal&s;e, in the old and new covenant.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lord &s;aith, <Q>He that &s;acrificeth to any god, &s;ave unto the Lord only, he &s;hall be utterly de&s;troy|ed,</Q> Exod. xxii. 20. So no god is to be minded, nor &s;acrificed to, but the Lord God. It is death to &s;acrifice to any other god, &s;ave the Lord. The Lord &s;aith al&s;o, <Q>Thou &s;halt not offer the blood of my &s;acrifice with leav|ened bread,</Q> Exod. xxiii. 18. So that &s;our heavy leav|en mu&s;t not be offered with the Lord's &s;acrifice. Again the Lord &s;aith; <Q>Thou &s;halt not build an altar of hewn
<PB N="380" REF="037441_0896_100D94741A785248">&s;tone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou ha&s;t pol|luted it.</Q> Exod. xx. 25. There&s;ore have a care of pol|luting the altar with your own tools, you that profe&s;s to offer the &s;piritual &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Jonah &s;aid; <Q>He would &s;acrifice unto the Lord with the voice of thank&s;giving,</Q> when he was in the &s;i&s;h's belly; and there he prayed unto the Lord, Jonah ii. For Jonah in the whale's belly had no lambs, nor rams, nor outward &s;acrifices to offer.</P>
<P>The Lord forbids his people to &s;acrifice with harlots, Ho&s;ea iv. 14. And the Lord forbids his people to offer &s;acrifice of the blind, lame, &s;ick, or that which was deform|ed, or had any blemi&s;h: as in Mal. i. and many other places. So they that offer &s;piritual &s;acrifice, mu&s;t not offer the blind, lame, blemi&s;hed, or deformed &s;acrifice to God.</P>
<P>The &s;cribe &s;aith unto Chri&s;t, <Q>To love God with all the heart, and with all the under&s;tanding, and with all the &s;oul, and with all the &s;trength, and to love his neighbour as him&s;elf, is more than all whole burnt offerings and &s;a|crifices,</Q> Mark xii. 33. <Q>And when Je&s;us &s;aw, that he an&s;wered di&s;creetly, he &s;aid unto him; Thou art not far from the kingdom of God,</Q> v. 34. To love God, and their neighbour as them&s;elves, was more than whole burnt|offerings and &s;acrifices in the time of the law; there&s;ore all offerings and &s;acrifices in the time of the go&s;pel, if there be not love to God and to their neighbour as them&s;elves, avail nothing.</P>
<P>David &s;aid, <Q>Let them &s;acrifice a &s;acrifice of thank&s;giv|ing, and declare his works with rejoicing,</Q> P&s;al. cvii. 22. 'The&s;e are the &s;acrifices that the Lord requires of his people, more than outward &s;acrifices. David &s;aid, <Q>Let my pray|er be &s;et forth before thee as incen&s;e; and the lifting up of mine hands as the evening &s;acrifice,</Q> P&s;al. cxli. 2. Here David looks upon his prayer to the Lord, and the lifting up of his hands to him, to be accepted with the Lord, as much as the outward incen&s;e, and the outward evening &s;|crifice. Again David &s;ays, <Q>The &s;acrifices of God are a broken &s;pirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not de&s;pi&s;e,</Q> P&s;al. li. 17. (See al&s;o I&s;a. lvii. 15. and chap. lxvi. 2.) The&s;e are the &s;acrifices that David &s;aid God would accept, and not de&s;pi&s;e; which are beyond the unbroken &s;pirit, and uncontrite heart, with outward offerings and &s;acrifices.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="037441_0897_100D9475ADC00940">
The adver&s;aries of the Jews would have joined with them towards the building of the temple, &s;aying, <Q>Let us build with you, for we &s;eek your God, as ye do; and we do &s;acrifice unto him.</Q> But the Jews refu&s;ed them, and &s;aid; <Q>Ye have nothing to do with us, to build an hou&s;e unto our God,</Q> Ezra iv. 2, 3. Here ye may &s;ee God's people refu&s;ed their building with them, and their &s;acri|fice. Solomon &s;aith, <Q>The &s;acrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,</Q> Prov. xv. 8. (See al&s;o I&s;a. i. 11. and chap. lxvi. 3.) Solomon al&s;o &s;aith, <Q>Better is a dry mor&s;el, and quietne&s;s therewith, than an hou&s;e full of &s;acrifices with &s;trife,</Q> Prov. xvii. 1. Now let all people con&s;ider what good your hou&s;e full of &s;acrifices doth with &s;trife, when a dry mor&s;el, and quietne&s;s therewith, is bet|ter? Con&s;ider all people, if ye live in wickedne&s;s, your &s;acrifice is an abomination to the Lord.</P>
<P>Again, Solomon &s;peaking of the &s;acrifice of fools, &s;aith; "They con&s;ider not, that they do evil," Eccle&s;. v. 1. Fools are &s;uch as do not walk in the Spirit of God, or be|gin in the &s;pirit, and end in the fle&s;h, like the fooli&s;h Gala|tians: for the Spirit of God is the Spirit of wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding, and cannot join with the &s;acrifices of the dead, nor of the fools, nor of the wicked, who&s;e &s;acrifice is abominable; who grieve and quench the Spirit of God: by which the &s;piritual and righteous offer up &s;piritual &s;acri|fices, acceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle Paul &s;aith, he was the <Q>mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to the Gentiles, mini&s;tering the go&s;pel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being &s;anctified by the Holy Gho&s;t,</Q> Rom. xv. 16. So ye may &s;ee, that all the acceptable offerings and &s;acrifices to God mu&s;t be &s;anctified by the Holy Gho&s;t. The &s;ame apo&s;tle &s;aith to the Corinthians; <Q>Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God, in your body, and in your &s;pirit, which are God's,</Q> 1 Cor. vi. 20. And to the Romans, he &s;aith; <Q>I be&s;eech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you pre&s;ent your bodies a living &s;a|crifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your rea|&s;onable &s;ervice,</Q> Rom. xii. 1. This is the duty of all true Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Peter al&s;o &s;aith, in his general epi&s;tle to the church of Chri&s;t; <Q>Ye al&s;o, as lively &s;tones, are built up a &s;piritu|al hou&s;e, an holy prie&s;thood, to offer up &s;piritual &s;acrifi|ces, acceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q> 1 Pet. ii. 5.
<PB N="382" REF="037441_0898_100D947852915F48">So every man and woman mu&s;t come to the Spirit of God in their own hearts, if they offer up &s;piritual &s;acrifices, ac|ceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For as Chri&s;t &s;aith, "Every &s;acrifice &s;hall be &s;alted with &s;alt," Mark ix. 49. And in the Old Te&s;tament ye may &s;ee, all their outward offerings they were" to &s;ea&s;on with &s;alt," Levit. ii. 13. A type and figure of Chri&s;t, who <Q>gave him&s;elf for us, an offering and a &s;acrifice to God, for a &s;weet-&s;melling &s;a|vour,</Q> Ephe&s;. v. 2. Therefore all his people mu&s;t be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t and with fire, that they may be &s;alted with fire, and every &s;acrifice &s;alted with &s;alt, with the Spirit of grace, that is poured upon all: &s;o that they may offer up this &s;piritual &s;acrifice, acceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Sanmel &s;aid to king Saul; "Hath the Lord as great de|light in burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices, as in obeying the <Q>voice of the Lord? behold to obey is better than &s;acri|fice; and to hearken, than the fat of rams,</Q> 1 Sam. xv. 22. So ye may &s;ee, all offerings and &s;acrifices are no|thing, if there be not an hearkening to the Lord in his Spi|rit, and an obeying of his voice.

<P>THE Lord by his eternal arm and power having &s;up|ported you in all your &s;ufferings, great &s;poiling of goods, and tedious impri&s;onments, only for &s;erving and wor&s;hipping the living God that made you; who gave up

Dear brethren, a great con|cern lies upon me from the Lord to write unto you, <Q>That none may abu&s;e this liberty, nor the mercies of the Lord, but prize them;</Q> for there is great danger in time of liber|ty, of getting up, and getting into ea&s;e, loo&s;ene&s;s, and fal&s;e liberty. And now, &s;eeing, that ye have not the out|ward per&s;ecutors to war with in &s;ufferings, with the &s;pirit|ual weapons keep down that which would not be &s;ubject to Chri&s;t; that he, the holy One, may reign in your hearts; that your lives, conver&s;ations, and words may preach righteon&s;ne&s;s and truth; that ye may all &s;hew forth good en&s;amples of true believers in Chri&s;t, in virtue and holi|ne&s;s, an&s;wering that which may be known of God in all people, that ye are the &s;ons and daughters of God; &s;tand|ing fa&s;t in that righteous, holy liberty in Chri&s;t, the ju&s;t and holy One, that has made you free, over the loo&s;e or fal&s;e; &s;hunning the occa&s;ions of vain di&s;putes, and fooli&s;h que&s;tions of men of corrupt minds: for the &s;erpent was the fir&s;t que&s;tioner of Eve, who drew her and Adam out of the truth. Therefore as ye have received Chri&s;t, live and walk in him, who brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head, who is your &s;afe &s;anctuary; in whom ye have election reconcili|ation, and peace with God.

<P>By that time the yearly meeting was over, I was very much wearied and &s;pent: wherefore about a week after I got out of town to a friend's hou&s;e a little beyond Edmon|ton, where, and at South-&s;treet, I abode &s;ome time, and had meetings among&s;t friends there; and at Winchmore|hill and Berry-&s;treet. Having my mind continually exer|ci&s;ed in the things of God, the &s;en&s;e of his infinite good|ne&s;s and mercy to mankink, in vi&s;iting them, after they had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed and rebelled again&s;t him, and providing a way and means for their return to him again, was very much upon me; and in the opening of the Spirit of truth, I writ the following paper on that &s;ubject:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>GOD, who made all men and women, though they have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his commands and laws, rebelled again&s;t him, hated his light, grieved his Spirit, and walk|ed de&s;pitefully again&s;t his Spirit of grace; yet he who is merciful, would have all to be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. All that come to the knowledge of the truth, mu&s;t know it in their inward parts; I &s;ay, the grace and truth, which comes by Je&s;us, all that know and find it, know and find it in their hearts. Such find the hidden man of the heart, the pearl, the leaven, the lo&s;t piece of &s;ilver, and the kingdom of heaven within. For until all come to the light and truth in their hearts, they have been &s;trangers to the&s;e things, in Adam in the fall, from the image of God, his light, power and &s;pirit, and kingdom. But Chri&s;t, that never fell, brings man and woman again, that follow him, to know the&s;e things, and to know the truth, him the Saviour, and brings them into his image, and his everla&s;ting kingdom.</P>
<P>The devil, who is out of the truth, tempted man and woman to di&s;obey God; and &s;o drew them into the fall
<PB N="385" REF="037441_0901_100D947E37A9ADF8">from the truth. It is the devil that hath &s;topped men's eyes, ears, and hearts from the truth, who is called the god of the world; who hath blinded the eyes of infidels, or heathen. But Chri&s;t, who brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head, and de&s;troys the devil and his works, doth open men's hearts, eyes, and ears, who is their Saviour and Redeemer, and giveth life eternal to his people, that obey him and his truth. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for ever through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath ta&s;ted death for all men, to bring them out of the death of Adam; and is a propitiation for the &s;ins of the whole world, and gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified of in due time. For as by Adam's tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion and di&s;obedience death and condemnation came upon all men, &s;o by Chri&s;t's obedience unto death, ju&s;ti|fication of life is come upon all men: and <Q>he that be|lieveth in Chri&s;t hath eternal life; but he that doth not is condemned already.</Q> But God would have all men to be &s;aved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth, as it is in Je&s;us, who is their Saviour; and in him there is no condemnation.</P>

By this holy Spirit the holy and righteous God doth draw people from their unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and un|holine&s;s to Chri&s;t, the righteous and holy One, the great Prophet in his New Covenant and New Te&s;tament, whom Mo&s;es in the Old Covenant and Te&s;tament &s;aid, God would rai&s;e up like unto him, whom people &s;hould <Q>hear in all things; and they that would not hear him &s;hould be cut off.</Q> They that do not hear the Son of God, the great Prophet, do not mind the drawing of the Father by his holy Spirit to his Son; but they that mind the drawings of the good Spirit of the Father to his Son, the Spirit doth give them under&s;tanding to know God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which is eternal life. Then they know that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the way, the truth, and the life, and that none can come unto God but by and through his Son, who is their &s;hepherd to feed them in his pa&s;tures and &s;prings of life; and his &s;heep know his holy voice, in whom there was no &s;in, and in who&s;e mouth there was no guile, and an hireling they will not hear, for he careth not for the &s;heep: for they are not the hireling's but Chri&s;t's, who hath laid down his life for his &s;heep. He that robs and &s;teals his neighbour's words, climbeth up another way, and entereth not by the door, is a thief and a robber; but Chri&s;t is the door into his &s;heepfold, for his &s;heep to enter in by. They know that Chri&s;t is the bi&s;hop of their &s;ouls, to &s;ee that they do not go a&s;tray from God nor 'out of his pa&s;tures of life. They know that Chri&s;t is their mediator, who makes their peace with God. They know that Chri&s;t is their high-prie&s;t, made higher than the heavens, and hath died for their &s;ins, and doth clean&s;e them with his blood, and is ri&s;en for their ju&s;tification, and is able to the utmo&s;t to &s;ave all that come to God by him.</P>

Before I left this place I wrote another paper, the &s;cope whereof was to &s;hew, by many in&s;tances taken out of the holy &s;criptures, that the kingdom of God, which mo&s;t people talk of at a di&s;tance and refer altogether to another life, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure to be known and entered into in this life; but that none can know an entrance thereinto, but &s;uch as are regenerated and born again. Of that paper the following is a copy:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>CHRIST &s;aith, "except a man be born again he can|not &s;ee the kingdom of God," John iii. 3. <Q>That which is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit,</Q> ver. 6. So <Q>except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,</Q> ver. 5. And John, writing to the &s;even churches of A&s;ia, calls him&s;elf their <Q>brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and pati|ence of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q> Rev. i. 9. Here you may &s;ee that John was in the kingdom, &s;o he was born again: for he did not only &s;ee the kingdom but was in it.</P>
<P>And John &s;aith, <Q>Behold what manner of love the Father hath be&s;towed upon us, that we &s;hould be called the &s;ons of God; therefore the world knoweth us not, becau&s;e it knew him not,</Q> 1 John iii. 1. <Q>Beloved, now are we the &s;ons of God,</Q> ver. 2. <Q>If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doth righte|ou&s;ne&s;s is born of him,</Q> chap. ii. 29. <Q>Who&s;oever is born of God doth not commit &s;in, for his &s;eed remaineth in him, and he cannot &s;in becau&s;e he is born of God.</Q> chap. iii. 9. <Q>Let us love one another, for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love,</Q> chap. iv. 7, 8. <Q>Who&s;oever believ|eth that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, is born of God,</Q> chap. v. 1. <Q>Who&s;oever is born of God, overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith,</Q> ver. 4. Were not the&s;e that were born of God in the kingdom of God? And &s;eeing John &s;ays, <Q>Every one that doth righteou&s;ne&s;s is born of God;</Q> do not &s;uch &s;ee the kingdom of God, that &s;tands in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and en|ter into it?</P>
<P>Peter, in his fir&s;t general epi&s;tle to the church of Chri&s;t, &s;aith, "As new-born babes de&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby," 1 Pet. ii. 2. And he
<PB N="390" REF="037441_0906_100D948A1B514940">tells them they were <Q>a cho&s;en generation, a royal prie&s;t|hood, an holy nation, a peculiar people,</Q> that they &s;hould <Q>&s;hew forth the prai&s;es of him who had called them out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light,</Q> ver. 9. And that <Q>as lively &s;tones they were built up a &s;piritual hou&s;e, an holy prie&s;thood to offer up &s;piritual &s;acrifices, acceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q> ver. 5. Did not the&s;e new|born babes, the&s;e lively &s;tones, &s;piritual hou&s;ehold, royal prie&s;thood, holy nation, and cho&s;en generation, who were called out of darkne&s;s into Chri&s;t's marvellous light, &s;ee and enter into his holy kingdom, being heirs of the &s;ame? who were <Q>born again, not of corruptible &s;eed but of in|corruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abid|eth for ever,</Q> 1 Pet. i. 23. And had not &s;uch an en|trance mini&s;tered to them into the everla&s;ting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>James, in his general epi&s;tle to the church of Chri&s;t, &s;aith, <Q>Hath not God cho&s;en the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promi&s;ed to them that love him?</Q> James ii. 5. The apo&s;tle Paul &s;aith, <Q>God &s;ent forth his &s;on made of a woman, &amp;c. to re|deem them that were under the law, that we may receive the adoption of &s;ons; and becau&s;e ye are &s;ons, God hath &s;ent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a &s;ervant but a &s;on, and if a &s;on then an heir of God through Chri&s;t,' Gal. iv. 4, 5, 6, 7. The &s;ame apo&s;tle &s;aith, As many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the &s;ons of God;</Q> and tells the &s;aints at Rome, <Q>Ye have receiv|ed the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father. The Spirit it&s;elf beareth witne&s;s with our &s;pirit, that we are the children of God; and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chri&s;t: if &s;o be we &s;uffer with him, that we may be al&s;o glorified together,</Q> (namely with Chri&s;t) Rom. viii. 14, 15, 16, 17. Now &s;eeing they are the &s;ons of God that are led by the Spirit of God, and the Spirit beareth witne&s;s unto their &s;pirit that they are the children of God, heirs of God, and joint|heirs with Chri&s;t, are not all the&s;e children of God heirs of the righteous glorious kingdom of God? And do they not &s;ee it and enter into it?</P>
<P>The Lord &s;aith in Ho&s;ea i. 10. <Q>Where it was &s;aid unto them, ye are not my people, there it &s;hall be &s;aid unto them, ye are the &s;ons of the Living God.</Q> Did not
<PB N="391" REF="037441_0907_100D948CC4D6B560">this relate to the go&s;pel-days of the New Covenant? See Rom. ix. 26. And what the Lord &s;aid by the prophet: Jeremiah, chap. xxxi. 1. the apo&s;tle applies to the go&s;pel-day, and &s;ays, <Q>Be ye &s;eparate, &s;aith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and ye &s;hall be my &s;ons and daugh|ters, &s;aith the Lord Almighty,</Q> 2 Cor. vi. 16. Are not the&s;e the children that &s;ee and enter into the righteous kingdom of God, that &s;eparate from that which is unclean and touch it not?</P>
<P>The Lord faith al&s;o by I&s;aiah, <Q>I will &s;ay to the north, give up, and to the &s;outh, keep not back; bring my &s;ons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth,</Q> I&s;a. xliii. 6. Then doth not he bring them to his king|dom of glory, that &s;tands in righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t?</P>
<P>The Lord &s;aid to Job, <Q>When the morning-&s;tars &s;ang together, and all the &s;ons of God &s;houted for joy,</Q> Job. xxxviii. 7. Where did the&s;e &s;ons of God &s;hout for joy? Was it not in his kingdom of glory?</P>
<P>Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>The lea&s;t in the kingdom of God is greater than John,</Q> Luke vii. 28. And in chap. xvi. 16. he &s;ays, <Q>The law and the prophets were until John; &s;ince that time (viz. &s;ince the law and the prophets and John) the kingdom of God is preached, and every man pre&s;&s;eth into it.</Q></P>
<P>The good &s;eed are the children of the kingdom, Matt. xiii. 38. And <Q>the righteous &s;hall &s;hine &s;orth as the &s;un in the kingdom of their Father,</Q> ver. 43. Chri&s;t &s;aid unto his di&s;ciples, <Q>Unto you it is given to know the my&s;teries of the kingdom of God.</Q> Mark iv. 11. Chri&s;t lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed up his eyes upon his di&s;ciples, and &s;aid, <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed be ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God,</Q> Luke vi. 20. The apo&s;tles preached the kingdom of God. The&s;e were born again, that &s;aw and knew the kingdom of God and preached it.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, <Q>Fear not little flock, for it is your Father's good plea&s;ure to give you the king|dom.</Q> Luke xii. 32. "I appoint to you a kingdom," &s;aid Chri&s;t, "as my Father hath appointed to me." chap. xxii. 29. The Lord &s;aid, <Q>He that overcometh &s;hall in|herit all things, and I will be his God and he &s;hall be my &s;on,</Q> Rev. xxi. 7. And John &s;aith, <Q>I have written unto you, young men, becau&s;e ye are &s;trong, and the
<PB N="392" REF="037441_0908_100D948E56DB45C8">word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one,</Q> 1 John ii. 14. And Chri&s;t, by whom are all things, is &s;aid "to bring many &s;ons to glory," Heb. ii. 10.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q>Wo unto you &s;cribes and Phari&s;ees, hypo|crites, for ye &s;hut up the kingdom of heaven again&s;t men; for ye neither go in your&s;elves, neither &s;uffer ye them that are entering to go in,</Q> Matt. xxiii. 13. <Q>Wo unto you, lawyers, for ye have taken away the key of knowledge; ye entered not in your&s;elves, and them that were entering in ye hindered,</Q> Luke xi. 52. Chri&s;t gives unto his chil|dren the keys of the kingdom, his Spirit; but the &s;cribes, phari&s;ees, and lawyers, great profe&s;&s;ors, who were erred from the Spirit, like the great profe&s;&s;ors in our age, that &s;coff at the Spirit, and draw people from the Spirit of God within, the&s;e &s;hut up the kingdom from men, and draw people from the key of knowledge, and the key of the kingdom. <Q>For no man knows the things of God, but by the Spirit of God;</Q> for the things of God are &s;pi|ritually di&s;cerned. The Spirit is the key, by which the kingdom of God and the things of God are revealed, di&s;|cerned, and known, according to 1 Cor. ii. 10, 11, 13, 14. The apo&s;tle names &s;ome in his epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians, and &s;ays, <Q>The&s;e are my fellow-workers unto the king|dom of God,</Q> Col. iv. 11. And he tells that church, that <Q>God hath delivered us from the power of darkne&s;s, and hath tran&s;lated us into the kingdom of his dear Son,</Q> chap. i. 13. So ye may &s;ee the&s;e were born again that were tran&s;lated into the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and were fel|low-workers unto the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t exhorts his di&s;ciples to love and to do good, that they might be the children of their Father which is in hea|ven, Matt. v. 45. He bids them be perfect, even as their Father which is in heaven is perfect, ver. 48. The apo&s;|tle &s;aith to the church at Philippi, <Q>That ye may be blamele&s;s and harmle&s;s, the &s;ons of God, without rebuke, in the mid&s;t of a crooked and perver&s;e nation;</Q> among&s;t whom ye &s;hine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life, &amp;c. Phil. ii. 15, 16. And writing to the church of the The&s;&s;alonians, he puts them in mind how he had exhorted them that they would <Q>walk worthy of God, who had called them into his kingdom and glory,</Q> 1 The&s;&s;. ii. 12.</P>
<P>The Lord had promi&s;ed by the prophet Joel, that he
<PB N="393" REF="037441_0909_100D94906B32D298">would "pour out his Spirit upon all fle&s;h," and that <Q>Sons and daughters &s;hould prophe&s;y, old men &s;hould dream dreams, and young men &s;ee vi&s;ions,</Q> Joel ii. 28. The cau&s;e that &s;ons and daughters, hand-maids, &s;ervants, young men, and old men have not the&s;e heavenly vi&s;ions, dreams, and prophecies, is becau&s;e they are <Q>erred from the Spirit of God,</Q> which he poureth upon them; but as ma|ny as are led by the Spirit of God are the &s;ons of God.</P>
<P>John &s;aith Chri&s;t was the true light, "which lighteth every man that cometh into the world," John i. 9. And that <Q>as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the &s;ons of God, ver. 12. which were born not of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God,</Q> ver. 13. The rea&s;on why people do not become the &s;ons of God, is becau&s;e they do not receive Chri&s;t. The Jews, the great profe&s;&s;ors, who had the promi&s;es, prophecies, figures, and &s;hadows of him, would not receive him when he came. And now the prie&s;ts and high profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;t are &s;o far from receiving the light of Chri&s;t, and believing in it, that they hate the light and &s;coff at it, cal|ling it a natural con&s;cience, and &s;ome, <Q>Jack in the lan|thorn.</Q> Such are not like to become the &s;ons of God, nor to &s;ee the glorious kingdom of Chri&s;t, which &s;tands in righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. For the light that &s;hines in the heart gives the <Q>light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q> They that do not receive Chri&s;t Je&s;us, but hate his light (which is the life in him) and yet profe&s;s him in words, neither know the children of the light, nor true fellow&s;hip in the light, nor the kingdom of God, that &s;tands in right|eou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t; but by the light they are condemned. <Q>And this is the condemna|tion, that light is come into the world, and men love dark|ne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds are evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved,</Q> John iii. 19, 20. But the children of the light, that walk in the light, come to heavenly Jeru&s;alem, to the city of the Liv|ing God, to the innumerable company of angels, and to the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born, that are written in heaven, and can &s;ing Hallelujah.</P>

Having been more than a quarter of a year in the coun|try, I returned to London &s;omewhat better in health than &s;ormerly, having received much benefit by the country air. And it being a time of general liberty and great openne&s;s among&s;t the people, I had much &s;ervice for the Lord in the city, being almo&s;t daily at publick meetings, and fre|quently taken up in vi&s;iting friends that were &s;ick, and in other &s;ervices of the church. I continued at London about three months; then finding my &s;trength much &s;pent with continual labouring in the work of the Lord, and my body much &s;topped for want of fre&s;h air, I went to my &s;on Rou&s;e's by King&s;ton, where I abode &s;ome time, and vi&s;ited friends at King&s;ton. While I was there, it came upon me to write a paper concerning the Jews, &s;hewing, <Q>How by their di&s;|obedience and rebellion they lo&s;t the holy city and land.</Q> By which example the profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians may &s;ee what they are to expect, if they continue to di&s;obey and provoke the Lord. The copy here followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE Lord gave the Jews in the Old Te&s;tament the land of Canaan, and they built the temple at Jeru&s;a|lem to wor&s;hip in. It was called "the Holy temple," and Jeru&s;alem was called "the Holy City," and Canaan <Q>the Holy Land.</Q> But when the Jews rebelled again&s;t the good Spirit which God gave them to in&s;truct them, and rebelled again&s;t his law, and &s;et up idols and images, and defiled the land and the city, the Lord &s;ent his prophets to cry again&s;t them, to bring them back again to his Spirit, and to his law, and &s;o to God, to &s;erve and wor&s;hip him, that they might not wor&s;hip images and idols, the works of their own hands. But in&s;tead of hearkening to God's prophets, they per&s;ecuted them, and at la&s;t killed his Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and per&s;ecuted his apo&s;tles. But Chri&s;t told the Jews that both their city and temple &s;hould be laid wa&s;te, and they &s;hould be &s;cattered over all nations; and it was &s;o. Titus the Roman Emperor came and took Je|ru&s;alem, and de&s;troyed the city and temple, which was a day of vengeance upon the Jews for all their idolatries, thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wickedne&s;s, and for the innocent blood they had &s;hed both in the city and country; and they were driven out of their own city and land, and &s;cattered over all nations. The Jews had never power to get the land &s;ince, nor to build Jeru&s;alem nor the temple; but the Turk hath both the land of Canaan and that which is called <Q>the City of
<PB N="395" REF="037441_0911_100D94957620D790">Jeru&s;alem.</Q> Now the Turk neither makes images nor wor&s;hips images; &s;o it is a ju&s;t hand of the Lord that he &s;hould be over the per&s;ecuting, idolatrous Jews, &s;o that they cannot defile the land of Canaan now with images and idols, for the Turk hath not, who neither makes ima|ges nor idols, nor wor&s;hips them. The Jews mu&s;t never hope, believe, nor expect, that ever they &s;hall go again in|to the land of Canaan, to &s;et up an outward wor&s;hip at Jeru&s;alem, and there for their prie&s;ts to offer outward &s;a|crifices of rams, &s;heep, and heifers, &amp;c. for burnt-offer|ings; for Chri&s;t, the one offering, hath offered him&s;elf once for all, and by this one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are &s;anctified. And Chri&s;t hath changed the prie&s;thood of Aaron, that offered &s;acrifices, which was made after the power of a carnal commandment; but Chri&s;t was made after the power of an endle&s;s life, a prie&s;t for ever, who was holy, harmle&s;s, and &s;eparate from &s;in|ners, and is a prie&s;t made higher than the heavens. This is the prie&s;t that gives power to all that receive him to become the &s;ons and daughters of God; and Jeru&s;alem that is above is the mother of all the &s;ons and daughters of God, which is free; but Jeru&s;alem that is below is in bondage with her children. They that are the children of Jeru&s;alem that is above do not look down at Jeru&s;alem that is below; but they look at Jeru&s;alem that is above, which is their mother. Chri&s;t &s;aid, <Q>Neither at outward Jeru&s;alem, nor in the mountain of Samaria &s;hould God be wor&s;hipped; but God &s;hould be wor&s;hipped in Spirit and in truth; for he is a Spirit, and &s;uch he &s;eeks to wor|&s;hip him,</Q> John iv. This is the wor&s;hip that Chri&s;t &s;et up above &s;ixteen hundred years ago; therefore the idola|trous Jews mu&s;t never think to offer their outward offer|ings and &s;acrifices, nor &s;et up their outward wor&s;hip at Jeru&s;alem, in the holy land of Canaan more. For Chri&s;t, by the offering up of him&s;elf once for all, for the &s;ins of the whole world, hath ended all the Jews offerings, and changed the prie&s;thood, and the law by which it was made, and hath blotted out the hand-writing of ordinances, which commanded both prie&s;ts and offerings, and triumphed over them. So he is the offering and &s;acrifice of all the children of the New Te&s;tament, New Covenant, and hea|venly New Jeru&s;alem that is above. He is their Prophet 'that openeth to them, their Shepherd that &s;eeds them, their Bi&s;hop that over&s;ecs them, and Prie&s;t that died for their

Be|lieve&s;t thou this?" Martha &s;aid, "Yea, Lord," John xxv. 26. This is the true &s;ub&s;tantial belief, which they that believe &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life. John &s;aith, <Q>This is the record that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son,</Q> John v. 11. <Q>The life was manife&s;ted, and we have &s;een it and bear witne&s;s, and &s;hew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manife&s;ted unto us,</Q> 1 John i. 2. So the&s;e were the believers that had eternal life in the Son of God, and &s;hewed it unto others. <Q>He that hath the Son hath life,</Q> &s;aith John, <Q>and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life,</Q> 1 John v. 12. Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>Every one that hath for&s;aken hou&s;es, or brethren, or &s;i&s;t|ers, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my name's &s;ake, &s;hall receive an hundred fold, and &s;hall inherit everla&s;ting life,</Q> Matt. xix. 29. The wicked that do not receive Chri&s;t &s;hall go into everla&s;ting puni&s;h|ment, but the righteous into everla&s;ting life. The true &s;ervants of God have their fruits unto holine&s;s, and their end is everla&s;ting life. For <Q>the wages of &s;in is death, but the gift of God is everla&s;ting life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</Q> Such have a building of God, an hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Therefore I de|&s;ire that God's people may endure all things, that they may obtain this &s;alvation which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, with eternal glory. For Chri&s;t, being made perfect, became the author of eternal &s;alvation to all them that obey him. This eternal &s;alvation is above an external &s;alvation; for they come to receive an eternal inheritance, and live in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel of joy, comfort, peace, and &s;alvation, having everla&s;ting life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>

<P>Several other things I wrote while I was at King&s;ton for my &s;pirit being continually exerci&s;ed towards God, I had many precious openings of divine matters; and divers places of &s;cripture, both in the Old Te&s;tament and in the New, relating to the &s;tate of regeneration and &s;anctification, &amp;c. were brought to my remembrance by the Holy Spirit; &s;ome of which I committed to writing, as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THEY that touched the dead were unclean, and were to be clean&s;ed by the water of purification, Numb. xix. And they which touch the dead doctrines or faiths, and let them in, burden the pure, defile and make them|&s;elves unclean, until the &s;pring of the water of the Word do ari&s;e and wa&s;h and clean them; for all the dead in Adam in the fall are unclean, and they mu&s;t be wa&s;hed by Chri&s;t, in his blood and water of life, who quickeneth and makes alive.</P>
<P>A dwarf might not come near to offer upon God's al|tar; but he might eat of the holy bread, that he might grow, Lev. xxi. 20, &amp;c. So the new-born babes may eat of the milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby and increa&s;e. He that had any blemi&s;h might not come near to offer upon God's altar; neither might any thing be of|fered upon God's altar that had any blemi&s;h, or was un|clean, Lev. xxi. And it is &s;aid, <Q>The ungodly &s;hall not &s;tand in the judgment, nor &s;inners in the congregation of the righteous,</Q> P&s;a. i. 5. But God &s;tandeth in the con|gregation of the mighty, P&s;al. lxxxii. 1.</P>
<P>The camp of God was to be kept clean and holy. That which was unclean, or defiled, was to be kept out of God's camp in the Old Te&s;tament. And in the New Te&s;ta|ment, all that is defiled and unclean mu&s;t be kept out of God's kingdom, the new and heavenly Jeru&s;alem that is from above. All was to pa&s;s through the fire (even of tho&s;e things that would bear the fire) and to be purified by &s;ire and water, before the people might come into God's camp, Numb. xxxi. So all mu&s;t be circumci&s;ed, and baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t and fire, clean&s;ed with
<PB N="400" REF="037441_0916_100D953C9E3C14F0">the blood of Chri&s;t, and wa&s;hed with the water of the Word, before they come into the kingdom of God, into heavenly Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle Paul &s;aith, <Q>We know that if our earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle were di&s;&s;olved, we have a build|ing of God, a hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan, earne&s;tly de&s;iring to be clothed upon with our hou&s;e which is from heaven, that mortality might be &s;wallowed up of life,</Q> 2 Cor. v. 1, 2, 4. Here is "[WE in the earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle;"] which [WE] are they that have received Chri&s;t, are become the &s;ons of God, new creatures, and children of the light, that believe in Chri&s;t's light; who have an eter|nal hou&s;e in the heavens, where mortality is &s;wallowed up of life, in which hou&s;e from heaven they will not groan.</P>
<P>Peter &s;aid, <Q>I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to &s;tir you up by putting you in remem|brance, knowing that &s;hortly I mu&s;t put off this my ta|bernacle, even as our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath &s;hewed me,</Q> 2 Pet. i. 13, 14. Peter knew he mu&s;t put off this taber|nacle &s;hortly: but as long as he was in it, he did &s;tir up the &s;aints to their duty in holine&s;s, that they might re|member it after he was decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Paul &s;aith, "The fir&s;t man is of the earth, earthly." (mark, earthly) 1 Cor. xv. 47. <Q>And as we have borne the image of the earthly, we &s;hall al&s;o bear the image of the heavenly,</Q> (mark, the heavenly) ver. 49. And <Q>we have this trea&s;ure in earthen ve&s;&s;els,</Q> &amp;c. 2 Cor. iv. 7. "And I live," &s;aid he, "yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me," Gal. ii. 20. who is the life of all God's people.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t &s;aid to the Jews, <Q>That the dead are rai&s;ed, even Mo&s;es &s;hewed at the bu&s;h, when he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of I&s;aac, and the God of Jacob; for he is not the God of the dead, but of the liv|ing, for all live unto him,</Q> Luke xx. 37, 38. So <Q>none of us liveth to him&s;elf, and no man dieth to him&s;elf; for whether we live, we live unto the Lord, and whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Whether we live therefore or die we are the Lord's. For to this end Chri&s;t both died and ro&s;e, that he might be Lord both of the dead and liv|ing,</Q> Rom. xiv. 7, 8, 9. For all died in Adam: and Chri&s;t by the grace of God ta&s;ted death for every man, that they might come out of the death in Adam to the eternal life in Je&s;us Chri&s;t: who is al&s;o a quickening &s;pirit; for
<PB N="401" REF="037441_0917_100D7FB2B960A8E0">as in Adam all died, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive. So Chri&s;t that died and ro&s;e again, is Lord both of the living and of the dead; for the living live to the Lord, and die in him, and are ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>All Chri&s;tendom &s;ay, that they believe in God and in Chri&s;t, and that they believe Mo&s;es and the prophets, and preach Chri&s;t, Mo&s;es, and the prophets; &s;o their words and writings are preached and printed, and ye &s;ay ye be|lieve them. But what life do ye live? Are ye through the law dead to the law, that ye may live unto God? Are ye crucified with Chri&s;t? Doth Chri&s;t live in you? Is the life that ye now live in the fle&s;h by the faith of the Son of God, and ye do not live, but Chri&s;t liveth in you, who gave him&s;elf for you? Is this your pre&s;ent life? for "the ju&s;t live by the faith" which Chri&s;t is the Author and Fini&s;her of; by which holy, divine, precious faith they have victory over that which is vile, unholy, and not di|vine; and in this faith they plea&s;e God, and have acce&s;s to God and his Son, who fulfilleth the law and the pro|phets. For the law and the prophets were until John, and &s;ince that the kingdom of God hath been preached, and men pre&s;s into it; and the lea&s;t in the kingdom of God is greater than John, though he was the greate&s;t prophet born of a woman. See whether ye are in the kingdom that &s;tands in peace and righteou&s;ne&s;s and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, or not. Chri&s;t, the image of the invi&s;ible God, the fir&s;t-born of every creature, was before any creature; for by him were all things created that are in heaven and in the earth, vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers, <Q>all things were created by him and for him, and he was before all things, and by him all things con&s;i&s;t: and he is the head of the body, the church, and is the beginning, the fir&s;t-born from the dead.</Q> Here ye may &s;ee that all things were made by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and all things were created for Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and by him all things con&s;i&s;t and have their being, who is the fir&s;t-born from the dead, and dieth no more. It plea&s;ed the Father that in him all fulne&s;s &s;hould dwell, and by Chri&s;t to reconcile all things unto him&s;elf, whether they be things in heaven or things in the earth. "In him are hid all the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge," who is the head of all principality and power; for <Q>all power in heaven and earth is given to him,</Q> the fir&s;t-born of every creature, and the fir&s;t-born from the dead, who
<PB N="402" REF="037441_0918_100D7FB573130ED8">liveth for evermore in his power over all, the Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world. While the world's &s;pi|rit rules in men's hearts, they do not know Chri&s;t, nor the beginning nor ending of the work of God. Chri&s;t was outwardly crucified and &s;lain without the gates of Jeru&s;a|lem by the di&s;obedient Jews; and they that hate the light of Chri&s;t, di&s;obey his go&s;pel, quench his Spirit, and are erred from his faith, "crucify to them&s;elves Chri&s;t afre&s;h." So Adam and Eve, and their children that di&s;obeyed God, did &s;lay the Lamb; the blind Jews, that di&s;obeyed God, crucified Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and the outward Chri&s;tians, that live and walk not in Chri&s;t, but in &s;in and evil, though they make an outward profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, yet crucify to them&s;elves Chri&s;t afre&s;h. As to Chri&s;t him&s;elf, he is <Q>a&s;|cended far above all principalities, thrones, powers, and dominions;</Q> &s;o that they cannot put him to death, or crucify him any more, as to him&s;elf: but what the killers, crucifiers, and per&s;ecutors do now upon the earth, is again&s;t Chri&s;t in them&s;elves, and in his members; as Chri&s;t &s;aid to Saul, "Why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?" Acts ix. 4. For what is done to his members, Chri&s;t takes as done to him&s;elf, Matth. xxv. 40, and 45. And they that did not vi&s;it Chri&s;t, but per&s;ecuted him in his members, per&s;ecuted Chri&s;t in them&s;elves fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;erpent, that enemy to man and woman, the de&s;|troyer, the god of the world, and prince of the air, that ruleth in the hearts of the di&s;obedient, got in by di&s;obedi|ence. But Chri&s;t brui&s;es his head, breaketh his power to pieces, and de&s;troys the devil and his works; and through death de&s;troys death, and the devil, the power of death. So Chri&s;t, the light and life, hath all power in heaven and earth; and openeth the pri&s;on doors, and the eyes of the blind, and takes captive him that hath led into captivity, and gives gifts unto men. So Chri&s;t bindeth the &s;trong man of &s;in, and &s;poils his goods, and ca&s;ts him out; Hal|lelujah! For the &s;trong man of &s;in is the god of the world, and his hou&s;e is that whole world that lieth in wickedne&s;s. And this God of the world hath kept his hou&s;e, and his goods have been in peace: until a &s;tronger than he come, and binds, and ca&s;ts him out: and then de&s;troys him and his goods. So Chri&s;t, the Son of God, who is &s;tronger than the devil, having de&s;troyed the devil and his works, &s;etteth up his own hou&s;e. All believers in the light are the children of light, are of the Son of God's &s;piritual
<PB N="403" REF="037441_0919_100D94A0AD40FDD0">hou&s;e, and the Son of God is over his hou&s;e for evermore: glory to God in the highe&s;t, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Amen!</P>
<P>God &s;pake by the mouth of his holy prophets concern|ing Chri&s;t Je&s;us, his Son, the holy One: &s;o they were ho|ly men, and not unholy, that God &s;pake by. All that name the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are to depart from iniquity.</P>

<P>I returned to London towards the latter end of the ele|venth month 1687, vi&s;iting friends in the way at Chi&s;wick and Hammer&s;mith, where I had two meetings, one upon a fea&s;t-day, and the other on occa&s;ion of a marriage; at which were many people of other denominations, among&s;t whom I had a very &s;ea&s;onable opportunity of opening the way of truth.</P>
<P>Being come to London, I vi&s;ited meetings in and about the city, as the Lord led me! in who&s;e &s;ervice I continued labouring till the middle of the fir&s;t-month 1687-8.

<P>Some time after the yearly meeting I went to my &s;on Mead's in E&s;&s;ex, and abode &s;ome weeks; often vi&s;iting friends meetings near, and &s;ometimes at Barking. After I had been awhile there, I went to vi&s;it friends at Waltham-Abbey, Hod&s;don, Enfield, South-&s;treet, Ford-Green, and
<PB N="406" REF="037441_0922_100D94A746061188">Winchmore-hill; where I had &s;everal very &s;erviceable meetings; the Lord opening many deep and weighty things through me, for the informing the under&s;tandings of inquirers, and building up tho&s;e that were gathered into the truth, and e&s;tabli&s;hing them therein.</P>
<P>In the &s;eventh month I returned to London, having been near three months in the country for my health's &s;ake, which was very much impaired; &s;o that I was hardly able to &s;tay in a meeting the whole time, and often after a meet|ing was fain to lie down upon a bed. Yet did not my weak|ne&s;s of body take me off from the &s;ervice of the Lord; but I continued to labour in and out of meetings in the work of the Lord, as he gave me opportunity and ability.</P>
<P>I had not been long in London, before a great weight came upon me, and a &s;ight the Lord gave me of the great bu&s;tles and troubles, revolution and change, which &s;oon after came to pa&s;s. In the &s;en&s;e whereof, and in the mov|ings of the Spirit of the Lord, I wrote, <Q>A general epi&s;tle to friends, to forewarn them of the approaching &s;torm; that they might all retire to the Lord, in whom &s;afety is,</Q> as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>MY dear friends and brethren every where, who have received the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to whom he has given power to become his &s;ons and daughters; in him ye have life and peace, and in his everla&s;ting kingdom, that is an e&s;tabli&s;hed kingdom, and cannot be &s;haken, but is over all the world, and &s;tands in his power, and in righteou&s;ne&s;s and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, into which no unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, nor the &s;oul unclean &s;pirit of the devil in his in&s;tru|ments can enter. Dear friends and brethren, every one in the faith of Je&s;us, &s;tand in his power, who has all power in heaven and earth given to him, and will <Q>rule the na|tions with his rod of iron, and da&s;h them to pieces like a potter's ve&s;&s;el,</Q> that are not &s;ubject and obedient to his power: who&s;e voice will &s;hake the heavens, and the earth, that that which may be &s;haken may be removed, and that which cannot be &s;haken may appear. Stand in him; and all things &s;hall work together for good to them that love him.</P>
<P>And now, dear friends and brethren, though the&s;e waves, &s;torms, and tempe&s;ts be in the world, yet you may all appear the harmle&s;s and innocent lambs of Chri&s;t, walking in his peaceable truth, and keeping in the Word of pow|er,

For the Word of God was before the world, and all things were made by it: it is a tried Word, which gave God's people in all ages wi&s;dom, power, and patience. Therefore let your dwelling and walking be in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who is called the Word of God; and in his power, which is over all. Set your affections on things that are above, where Chri&s;t &s;its at the right hand of God (mark) on tho&s;e things which are above, where Chri&s;t &s;its; not tho&s;e things that are below, which will change and pa&s;s away. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God, who by his eternal arm and power hath gathered a people to him&s;elf, and hath pre&s;erved his faithful to him&s;elf through many troubles, trials, and temptations: his power and &s;eed, Chri&s;t, is over all, and in him ye have life and peace with God. There|fore in him all &s;tand, and &s;ee your &s;alvation, who is fir&s;t and la&s;t, and the Amen.

<P>About this time great exerci&s;e and weights came upon me (as had u&s;ually done before great revolutions and chan|ges of government) and my &s;trength departed from me; &s;o that I reeled, and was ready to fall as I went along the &s;treets; and at length I could not go abroad at all, I was &s;o weak for a pretty while; till I felt the power of the Lord to &s;pring over all, and had received an a&s;&s;urance from him, that he would pre&s;erve his faithful people to him&s;elf through all.</P>

<P>Some time after this, my body continuing weak, I went with my &s;on Mead to his hou&s;e in E&s;&s;ex; where I &s;taid &s;ome weeks. In which time I writ many things relating to the &s;ervice of truth, &s;ome were printed &s;oon after; others were &s;pread abroad in manu&s;cript; and among&s;t other things, a few lines to this purpo&s;e:</P>
<P><Q>THAT, while men are contending for thrones here below, Chri&s;t is on his throne, and all his holy an|gels are about him, who is the beginning and the ending, the fir&s;t and la&s;t, over all. And that the Lord will make way and room for him&s;elf, and for them that are born of his Spirit, which are heavenly Jeru&s;alem's children, to come home to their free mother.</Q></P>
<P>A few words al&s;o I writ concerning the world's teachers, and the emptine&s;s of their teaching. Which were thus:</P>
<P><Q>DOTH not that which is called Chri&s;tendom live in talking of Chri&s;t's, of the apo&s;tles, and prophets words, and the letter of the Scriptures? And do not their prie&s;ts mini&s;ter the letter, with their own conceptions thereupon, for money, though the holy Scriptures were freely given forth from God, Chri&s;t, the prophets, and apo&s;tles? Yet the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life,</Q> 2 Cor. iii. 6. The mini&s;ters of the New Te&s;tament are not mini&s;ters of the letter, but of the Spirit, and they &s;ow to the Spirit, and of the Spirit reap life eternal. But people's &s;pending time about old authors, and talking of them, and of the outward letter, doth not feed their &s;ouls. For talking of victuals and clothes doth not clothe the body, nor feed it. No more are their &s;ouls and &s;pirits fed and clothed, except they have the bread and water of life from heaven to feed them, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to clothe them. Talking of out|ward things and &s;piritual things, and not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them, may &s;tarve both their bodies and their &s;ouls. Therefore

<P>With this I writ another &s;hort paper, &s;hewing, <Q>The hurt they did, and the danger they run into, who turned people from the inward manife&s;tation of Chri&s;t in the heart.</Q></P>

In the new covenant the apo&s;tle &s;aith; <Q>Let him be accur&s;ed that preacheth any other go&s;pel, than that which he had preached,</Q> Gal. i. 8. The go&s;pel that he preached was <Q>the power of God unto &s;alvation, to every one that be|lieveth,</Q> Rom. i. 16. And the go&s;pel that was preached to Abraham was, That in his <Q>&s;eed all nations, and all the families of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed.</Q> In order to bring men to this ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate, God poureth out of his Spirit upon all fle&s;h; and Chri&s;t doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world; and the grace of God, which bringeth &s;alvation, hath appeared unto all men, and teach|eth Chri&s;tians, the true believers in Chri&s;t, and God doth write his law in the true Chri&s;tians hearts, and putteth it in their minds, that they may <Q>all know the Lord, from the greate&s;t to the lea&s;t;</Q> and he giveth his word in their hearts to obey and do, and the anointing within them; &s;o that they need not any man to teach them, but as the anointing doth teach them. Now all &s;uch as turn people from the light, Spirit, grace, word, and anointing within, remove them from the heavenly land-mark of their eternal inheritance, and make them blind, and cau&s;e the blind to wander from the living way to their eternal hou&s;e in the heavens, and from the new and heavenly Jeru&s;alem.

<P>About the middle of the fir&s;t month, 1688-9, I went to London, the parliament then &s;itting, and being then about the bill of indulgence.

<P>In this and other &s;ervices I continued till towards the end of the &s;econd month, when being much &s;pent with continual labour, I got out of town for a little while, as far as Southgate and thereabouts.

<OPENER><SALUTE>To Peter Hendricks at Am&s;terdam; and to friends at Dantzick, who are under per&s;ecution.<LB>
Dear friend P. H.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH my love to thee and thy wife, J. Clau&s;e, and J. Roeloffs, and all the re&s;t of friends every where in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who reigns over all. I am glad to hear friends are well in all tho&s;e provinces and places every where, except Dantzick, and that you were &s;o diligent in &s;preading my papers to the &s;trengthening of friends. I have lately printed the Life of William Caton, but have not made a collection of his books. I think to &s;end &s;ome of them to you, which you may tran&s;late and print if you will; they may be &s;erviceable among friends, e&s;pecially them that knew him.</P>
<P>Concerning friends at Dantzick, whom the Lord hath &s;upported with his eternal arm and power to this day, I hope by the &s;ame arm and power he will &s;upport them, and in it they will feel his ble&s;&s;ed pre&s;ence with them in all their &s;ufferings; who is over the cruelty of their per&s;e|cutors, who will hardly let them breathe outwardly or in|wardly, in the common air of their native &s;oil. Which &s;hews their immorality, inhumanity, and unchri&s;tianity, and that they want the coun&s;el of a Gamaliel among&s;t them; who&s;e actions are below the law of God, to <Q>do unto others as they would have others do unto them;</Q> God will not ble&s;s the doings of &s;uch. However I de&s;ire that friends may mind the Lord's power that is over all, be valiant for his truth, and keep upon their rock and foundation Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that &s;tands &s;ure in the time of the heat of per&s;ecution which is &s;o hot upon you, that they will not &s;uffer you to have &s;o much as your hou&s;es to work and &s;leep in, nor to meet nor &s;erve God in. The Lord beholds all &s;uch actors and their actions. Therefore look over all to him, who is able to deal with them, and reward them according to their works. God Almighty pre&s;erve you all in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in whom you have re&s;t, life and peace, Amen.</P>

<P>Chri&s;tian Shroder, pre&s;ident of the council, Emanuel Dilger, N. Gadecken, and N. Fraterus, deputy of the council, and the re&s;t of the magi&s;trates and prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een your order, and your breathing out per&s;ecution again&s;t that little flock, the lambs of Chri&s;t, that live under your juri&s;diction in the city of Dantzick, and that you have impri&s;oned and bani&s;hed two by the hangman out of the government of your city; and others you threaten to do the &s;ame to, with great puni&s;h|ment if they return.

Truly, I am heartily &s;orry for both your magi&s;trates and prie&s;ts, that go under the name of Chri&s;tians, and &s;hew &s;uch immoral, inhu|man, unchri&s;tian actions, below the royal law of God, which is <Q>to do to others as you would have them do unto you.</Q> For would you think it was moral, human, or chri&s;tian, or according to the law of God, if the king of Poland, who is of another religion than you, &s;hould bani&s;h you out of your city by the hangman, and call you murderers of &s;ouls? Could you &s;ay but this was according to the law of God, <Q>to do unto you as you would have done unto others?</Q> If you &s;ay, you have the &s;word, the horn, and the power: ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord that hath &s;hort|ened your &s;word, your power, and your horn, that it reaches no further than your juri&s;diction of Dantzick: and you do not know how long God may &s;uffer you to have your horn, your power and your &s;word. We are &s;ure you have not the mind nor Spirit of Chri&s;t; and the apo&s;|tle &s;aith, <Q>They that have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t are none of his,</Q> Rom. viii.

Peter and the apo&s;tles never drew the outward &s;word after, but &s;aid, their weapons were &s;piritual not carnal, and they did not wre&s;tle with fle&s;h and blood. Chri&s;t never gave any &s;uch command, that they &s;hould bani&s;h any by the hangman, that were not of their religion, nor would not receive it.

You are wor&s;e than tho&s;e barbarous people at Salee, who do not profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity; for you profe&s;s Chri&s;t in words, but in works deny him. Did you ever find, either in &s;crip|ture or hi&s;tory, that any per&s;ecutors pro&s;pered long? You are wor&s;e than they are in the Mogul's country, who they &s;ay permits &s;ixty religions in his dominions; and many others might be mentioned, which you are wor&s;e than them all in your cruelty and per&s;ecution of God's people only for meeting together in the name of Je&s;us, and &s;erv|ing and wor&s;hipping God, their Creator. No, they mu&s;t not breathe in their natural air, neither natural or &s;piritu|al, in your dominions. I pray, where had you the&s;e commands from? Neither from Chri&s;t nor his apo&s;tles. Do not you profe&s;s the &s;criptures of the New Te&s;tament to be your rule? But I pray you, what &s;cripture have you for this practice? It is good for you to be humble, to do ju&s;tice, love mercy, call home your bani&s;hed, and love and cheri&s;h them; yea, though they were your ene|mies, you are to obey the command of Chri&s;t, and love them. I wonder how you and your wives and families can &s;leep quietly in your beds, that do &s;uch cruel actions, without thinking the "Lord may do to you the &s;ame!" You cannot be without &s;en&s;e and feeling, except you be given over to reprobation, and your con&s;ciences &s;eared with a hot iron. But Chri&s;tian charity doth hope that you are not all in that &s;tate; but that there may be &s;ome relenting or con&s;ideration of your actions among &s;ome of you, either according to the law of God or his go&s;pel.</P>

<P>WHO have known the Lord's eternal arm and power, that hath pre&s;erved you upon the heavenly rock and foundation, and hath built your hou&s;e upon it; you have known many winds, tempe&s;ts, and &s;torms that have ri&s;en out of the &s;ea, where the bea&s;t ro&s;e, and many raging &s;torms that have ri&s;en by apo&s;tates of &s;everal &s;orts; but the &s;eed that brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head, and is the founda|tion of God's people, &s;tands &s;ure.

Dear friends every where, have power over your own &s;pirits. As God hath ble&s;&s;ed you with his outward things, have a care of tru&s;ting in them, or falling into difference one with another about the&s;e outward things that are below, which will pa&s;s away. But all live in the love of God, and in that live in peace with God, and one with another. Follow the works of charity, and overcome the evil with the good to all; for what good have all the tinklers done, with their cymbals and &s;ounding bra&s;s? They always bred confu&s;ion, and never did good in any age; tinkling with their cymbals, and &s;ounding with their bra&s;s, to draw out the &s;imple to follow them.

In which time I &s;ometimes vi&s;ited friends at King&s;ton, and wrote divers things for the &s;ervice of truth and friends. One was an epi&s;tle to friends at Barbadoes; as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To all friends in Barbadoes that are convinced of God's truth.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY de&s;ires are that ye may live and walk in his peace|able truth, and &s;hew forth that ye are children of the light and of the truth; for the heavenly, gentle, peaceable wi&s;dom is ju&s;tified of her children. But debate, &s;trife, wilfulne&s;s, laying open one another's nakedne&s;s and weak|ne&s;s, is not the practice of heavenly wi&s;dom's children (but of Ham's) nor from the Spirit of Chri&s;t; neither &s;uch as bite and tear one another; that is from a devouring &s;pirit, not the Spirit of Je&s;us, which covers that which is uncome|ly, and can forgive. My friends, you profe&s;s that truth which is beyond all the world's ways, therefore &s;ee that you excel them in the heavenly gentle wi&s;dom, that is ea|&s;y to be intreated; for the wi&s;dom of the world is not ea&s;y to be intreated, and &s;ometimes will not be intreated at all. Pray &s;ee you excel the world in wi&s;dom, in virtue, in kind|ne&s;s, in love that is over hatred, in meekne&s;s, humility, &s;obriety, civility, and mode&s;ty, in temperance and pati|ence, and in all morality and humanity; which will not act any thing below men nor unmanly. Shew forth true
<PB N="421" REF="037441_0937_100D94C86E0F0BD0">chri&s;tianity, and that ye are the converted and tran&s;lated believers in Chri&s;t, dwelling in the love of God that bear|eth all things, endureth all things, is not puffed up, and envies not. For they that are out of this love of God, and Chri&s;tian charity, are nothing but as a tinkling cym|bal and as &s;ounding bra&s;s, and are di&s;contented, murmur|ers and complainers, full of doubts, que&s;tions, and fal&s;e jealou&s;ies. Keep that &s;pirit out of the camp of God: for do not you read in the &s;criptures, both of the New and Old Te&s;tament, that the end of &s;uch was mi&s;ery? There|fore, in the love of God, build up one another; for love edifies the body of Chri&s;t, and he commands his believers to love enemies, and to love one another; by this they are known to be the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. But to live in envy, &s;trife, and hatred, is a mark that they are no di&s;ci|ples of Chri&s;t; <Q>for he that loveth not his brother abides in death, and who&s;oever hates his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. But they that love the brethren are pa&s;&s;ed from death to life,</Q> 1 John iii. 14, 15. And, <Q>If a man &s;ay, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath &s;een, how can he love God, whom he hath not &s;een? And this command|ment have we from God, that he who loveth God loves his brother al&s;o,</Q> chap. iv. 20, 21. Therefore <Q>love one another;</Q> for love is of God, and hatred is of the de|vil, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knows God. All are children of God by creation, therefore in that &s;tate they are to love their neighbours as them&s;elves, and <Q>to do unto all men as they would have them do unto them.</Q> Secondly, God pouring his Spirit upon all fle&s;h (or all men and women) all that are led by the Spirit of God are the Sons of God, heirs of God, and joint|heirs with Chri&s;t, and are in fellow&s;hip in the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, and in unity in the Spirit, the bond of peace. They that go out of this unity, out of the bond of peace, and do not keep it, break the King of kings peace; but they that keep in the unity and fellow&s;hip in the Spirit, and walk in the light, have fellow&s;hip one with another, and with the Father and the Son. It is not every one that talks of the light of the world, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, of Chri&s;t, and of God, but he that "doth the will of God." There|fore my friends, &s;trive to excel one another in love, in virtue, in good life and conver&s;ation; and &s;trive all to be
<PB N="422" REF="037441_0938_100D94CA91F749F8">of one mind, heart, and judgment in the Spirit of God; for in Chri&s;t all are one, and are in peace with him. The Lord God Almighty pre&s;erve you in him, your rock and foundation, that is heavenly and &s;tands &s;ure; that ye may be valiant for the truth upon earth, for the Lord and his glorious name; that ye may all &s;erve him in your genera|tion, and in his new creation in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, Amen.</P>
<P>And now that you are come into &s;o much favour with the magi&s;trates and powers, that they let you &s;erve the office of a con&s;table, &amp;c. without &s;wearing or taking any oaths, hereby Chri&s;t's doctrine and command, and his apo&s;tle's is &s;et up. I therefore de&s;ire that you may double your diligence in your offices, in doing that which is ju&s;t, true, and righteous; &s;o that ye may excel and exceed all that are tied or bound by oaths to perform their offices; and you can do it upon your Yea and Nay; &s;o &s;ay and &s;o do, according to Chri&s;t's doctrine and command. For Adam and Eve, by di&s;obeying the command of God, fell under condemnation; and they that di&s;obey the command of Chri&s;t, in taking oaths and &s;wearing, go into evil, and fall into condemnation, Mat. v. and James v.

<P>I &s;taid at King&s;ton till the beginning of the &s;eventh month, where not only friends came to vi&s;it me, but &s;ome con&s;iderable people of the world, with whom I di&s;cour&s;ed about the things of God. Then leaving King&s;ton, I went to London by water, vi&s;iting friends as I went, and taking Hammer&s;mith-meeting in my way. Having recovered &s;ome &s;trength by being in the country, when I was come to Lon|don I went from meeting to meeting, labouring diligently in the work of the Lord, and opening the divine my&s;teries of the heavenly things, as God in his Spirit opened them to me. But I found my body would not long bear the city; wherefore, when I had travelled among&s;t friends there about a month, I went to Tottenham-High-Cro&s;s, and from thence to Edward Man's country-hou&s;e near Winchmore-hill and to Enfield; &s;pending three weeks among&s;t friends thereabouts, and had meetings at all tho&s;e places. Then, being a little refre&s;hed in the country, I returned to Lon|don; where I tarried, labouring in the work of the mini&s;try,
<PB N="423" REF="037441_0939_100D94CC24B6C9D8">till the middle of the ninth month; at which time I went with my &s;on Mead to his hou&s;e in E&s;&s;ex, and abode there all the winter.

Many things al&s;o I wrote while I was there, &s;ome of which follow. One was an epi&s;tle to the quarterly and yearly meetings of friends in Penn&s;ylvania, New-England, Virginia, Maryland, the Jer|&s;eys, Carolina, and other plantations in America. Which was thus:</P>
<Q><P>My dear friends and brethren in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, WHO, by believing in his light, are become children of his light and of his day; my de&s;ires are, that you may all walk in the light and in the day, and keep the fea&s;t of Chri&s;t, our pa&s;&s;over, who is &s;acrificed for us, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedne&s;s; but let all that be purged out, that ye may be a new lump, keeping the fea&s;t of Chri&s;t, our pa&s;&s;over, with the unleavened bread of &s;incerity and truth. Let no leavened bread be found in your hou&s;es, nor in your meetings, nor in the camp of God, or hou&s;ehold of faith, which are the hou&s;ehold of Chri&s;t; but all that &s;our, old leaven, which makes people's hearts &s;our, and burn one again&s;t another, mu&s;t be purged out of the camp of God, and kept out. For the fea&s;t of Chri&s;t, our pa&s;&s;over, mu&s;t be kept in the New Covenant with his heavenly unlea|vened bread of life. The Jews fea&s;t in the Old Te&s;tament was kept with outward unleavened bread; and now in the New Te&s;tament, in the go&s;pel-day, our fea&s;t is to be kept with the heavenly unleavened bread of &s;incerity and truth. Therefore friends, I de&s;ire you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, and to keep this fea&s;t which the apo&s;tle directed the church of Chri&s;t to keep. Do not you &s;ee Chri&s;tendom, &s;o called, keep their fea&s;ts with the leavened bread of malice and wickedne&s;s? which makes them &s;o &s;our, and their hearts &s;o to burn one again&s;t another, that they have de&s;troyed, and do de&s;troy one another about religion. Therefore all live in the love of God, which keeps above the love of the world; &s;o that none of your hearts may be choaked or &s;urfeited with the&s;e outward things, or with the cares of the world which will pa&s;s away; but mind ye the world
<PB N="424" REF="037441_0940_100D94CDD5908200">and the life that is without end, that ye may be heirs of it. And, friends, you &s;hould &s;trive to excel all, both profe&s;&s;or and prophane, in morality, humanity, and Chri&s;tianity, mode&s;ty, &s;obriety, and moderation, and in a good, godly, righteous life and conver&s;ation; &s;hewing forth the fruits of the Spirit of God and that you are the children of the living God, children of light and of day, and not of the night. And &s;erve God in newne&s;s of life; for it is the life, and a living and walking in the truth, that mu&s;t an|&s;wer the witne&s;s of God in all people, <Q>that they, &s;eeing our good works, may glorify our Father which is in hea|ven.</Q> Therefore be valiant for God's holy pure truth, and &s;pread it abroad among both profe&s;&s;ors and prophane, and the Indians. And you &s;hould write over once a year, from all your yearly meetings, to the yearly meeting here, concerning your diligence in the truth, and of its &s;pread|ing, and of people's receiving it, both profe&s;&s;ors and pro|phane, and the Indians; and concerning the peace of the church of Chri&s;t among&s;t your&s;elves.

And that concern coming now again weightily upon me, I was moved to give forth the follow|ing as a reproof to &s;uch, and an exhortation and warning to all friends to beware of and keep out of tho&s;e &s;nares.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To all that profe&s;s the truth of God.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY de&s;ires are that you walk humbly in it; for when the Lord fir&s;t called me forth, he let me &s;ee that young people grew up together in vanity and the fa&s;hions of the world, and old people went downwards into the earth, raking it together; and to both the&s;e I was to be a &s;tranger. And now, friends, I do &s;ee too many young
<PB N="425" REF="037441_0941_100D94D02A092B60">people that profe&s;s the truth grow up into the fa&s;hions of the world, and too many parents indulge them; and among&s;t the elder &s;ome are declining downwards and rak|ing after the earth. Therefore, take heed that you are not making your graves while you are alive outwardly, and loading your&s;elves with thick clay, Hab. ii. 6. For if you have not power over the earthly Spirit, and that which leadeth into a vain mind, and the fa&s;hions of the world, and into the earth; though you have often had the rain fall upon your fields, you will but bring forth thi&s;tles, briers, and thorn, which are for the fire. Such will be|come brittle, peevi&s;h, fretful &s;pirits, that will not abide the heavenly doctrine, the admonitions, exhortations, and reproofs of the Holy Gho&s;t, or heavenly Spirit of God; which would bring you to be conformable to the death of Chri&s;t, and to his image, that ye might have fellow&s;hip with him in his re&s;urrection. Therefore it is good for all to bow to the name of Je&s;us, their Saviour, that all may confe&s;s him to the glory of God the Father. For I have had a concern upon me, in a &s;en&s;e of the danger of young people's going into the fa&s;hions of the world, and old peo|ple's going into the earth, and many going into a loo&s;e and fal&s;e liberty, till at la&s;t they go quite out into the &s;pi|rit of the world as &s;ome have done. The hou&s;e of &s;uch hath been built upon the &s;and on the &s;ea-&s;hore, not upon Chri&s;t the Rock; that are &s;o &s;oon in the world again, un|der a pretence of liberty of con&s;cience. But it is not a pure con&s;cience, nor in the Spirit of God, nor in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; for in the liberty in the Spirit there is the unity, which is the bond of peace; and all are one in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in whom is the true liberty: and this is not of the world, for he is not of the world. Therefore all are to &s;tand fa&s;t in him, as they have received him; for in him there is peace, who is the Prince of Peace, but in the world there is trouble. For the &s;pirit of the world is a trouble&s;ome &s;pirit, but the Spirit of Chri&s;t is a peaceable Spirit: in which God Almighty pre&s;erve all the faithful, Amen.</P>

<P>Another I wrote while I was here concerning the En&s;ign which I&s;aiah prophe&s;ied the Lord &s;hould &s;et up for the

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>THE Lord &s;aith, <Q>They &s;hall not hurt nor de&s;troy in all my holy mountain; for the earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;ea,</Q> I&s;a. xi. 9. <Q>And in that day there &s;hall be a root of Je&s;&s;e, which &s;hall &s;tand for an en&s;ign of the people; to it &s;hall the Gentiles &s;eek, and his re&s;t &s;hall be glorious,</Q> ver. 10. <Q>And he &s;hall reign over the Gentiles, and in him &s;hall the Gentiles tru&s;t,</Q> Rom. xv. 12. This En&s;ign is Chri&s;t, who was prophe&s;ied of by the prophet; which prophecy the apo&s;tle, who was a mini&s;ter to the Gentiles, &s;heweth was fulfilled in the New Te&s;tament. In this day of Chri&s;t, I&s;aiah &s;aith, <Q>The Lord &s;hall &s;et his hand again the &s;econd time to recover the remnant of his people, which &s;hall be left, from A&s;&s;yria and from Egypt, &amp;c. And he &s;hall &s;et up an en&s;ign for the nations, and &s;hall a&s;&s;emble the outca&s;ts of I&s;rael, and gather together the di&s;|per&s;ed of Judah from the four corners of the earth,</Q> ver. 11, 12. This is in the day of Chri&s;t, and his go&s;pel of life and &s;alvation, which is preached to every creature un|der heaven, who <Q>enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world,</Q> both Jews and Gentiles, that by his hea|venly divine light they may &s;ee Chri&s;t, their En&s;ign and Captain of their &s;alvation; &s;o Chri&s;t is one En&s;ign both to the Jews and Gentiles.

And, <Q>This is my covenant with them, &s;aith the Lord, my Spirit that is upon thee (to wit, Chri&s;t) and my words, which I have put in thy mouth, &s;hall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy &s;eed, nor out of the mouth of thy &s;eed's &s;eed, &s;aith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever,</Q> ver. 21. <Q>Ari&s;e, &s;hine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is ri&s;en upon thee,</Q> chap. lxi. 1. "And the Gentiles &s;hall come to thy light," ver. 3. <Q>And the abundance of the &s;ea &s;hall be converted unto three,</Q> ver. 5.

The Lord &s;aith (&s;peaking of Chri&s;t) <Q>I have put my &s;pirit up|on him, he &s;hall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles,</Q> I&s;a. xlii. 1. <Q>I will give thee for a covenant of the peo|ple, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the pri&s;oners from the pri&s;on, and them that &s;it in darkne&s;s, out of the pri&s;on-hou&s;e. I am the Lord, that is my name, and my glory will I not give to another, neither my prai&s;e to graven images,</Q> ver. 6, 7, 8. So Chri&s;t the Light is come, and the glory of the Lord is ri|&s;en, and the Gentiles are come to the light of Chri&s;t. This prophecy of I&s;aiah concerning Chri&s;t, many of the Gen|tiles witne&s;s fulfilled, that <Q>&s;alvation is come to the Gen|tiles,</Q> Rom. xi. 11. God gave his glory to his &s;on; and Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>The glory which thou gave&s;t me, I have given them (namely his believers and followers) that they may be one, even as we are one,</Q> John xvii. 22. Here you may &s;ee the promi&s;es and prophecies are fulfil|led in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, whom God hath given for an En&s;ign both to the Jews and Gentiles, and the Captain of their Salvation; and he doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world: that with his heavenly divine light they might &s;ee Chri&s;t, the Lord from heaven, their Captain and En&s;ign, and tru&s;t in him, their Conqueror; who brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head, and de&s;troys the devil and his works: and Chri&s;t and his followers overcome the dragon, bea&s;t, and fal&s;e prophet. Therefore all Jews, Gentiles, and Chri&s;tians, that come to believe in Chri&s;t, are to &s;tand to their En&s;ign, Chri&s;t, who is al&s;o the Captain of their Salvation, above all en&s;igns and captains below, for he is from above; therefore all are to tru&s;t in him, for he is certain and able to &s;ave to the utmo&s;t. He is the &s;ame En&s;ign and Captain to-day as he was ye&s;terday, and &s;o for ever, the Fir&s;t and La&s;t, the Beginning and Ending, the Lord of lords, and King of all kings upon the earth; and there is nothing certain to be tru&s;ted in below Chri&s;t Je&s;us who is from above. You &s;ee in the &s;criptures, there were many ways and religions among the heathen, as there were many &s;ects among the Jews when Chri&s;t came; and now there are many &s;ects or religions among the Chri&s;tians, who believe from the &s;criptures "that he is come," as the Jews believed "he was to come." But they that clo&s;e their eyes, and &s;top their ears to the light of Chri&s;t, are
<PB N="428" REF="037441_0944_100D94D7590B8790">not like to &s;ee Chri&s;t who hath enlightened them, to be their En&s;ign and the Captain of their Salvation, that &s;ee not with the heavenly eye, nor hear with the heavenly ear, to &s;ee and hear their heavenly En&s;ign and Captain of their Salvation, to convert and heal them; that they might follow him, and be of his holy camp, his heavenly &s;ol|diers, to whom he gives &s;piritual arms and armour, the helmet of &s;alvation, the brea&s;t-plate of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the armour of light, and the &s;hield of faith, (which will quench all the fiery darts of Satan and give victory) and the &s;word of the Spirit, the word of God, which &s;hall cut, hammer down, and burn up all the &s;trong holds of Satan. Al&s;o he clotheth his &s;oldiers with fine linen, white and clean, his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;hoeth them with the everla&s;ting go&s;pel of peace, the power of God; which clothes and &s;hoes will never wax old. And all that are &s;hod with the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, the power of God, will never wax old; but will &s;tand all &s;torms and tempe&s;ts in the world. They that are &s;hod with the go&s;pel, the power of God, can in it tread upon &s;erpents, vipers, and &s;corpions, and all the veno|mous bea&s;ts upon the earth, and all the thorns, briers, bram|bles, thi&s;tles, &s;harp rocks, and mountains, and never be hurt, nor never wear out their &s;hoes; for their feet were al|ways beautiful upon the mountains. Mo&s;es, a captain, the &s;ervant of the Lord, &s;aid unto the people of I&s;rael, <Q>I have led you forty years in the wilderne&s;s; your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy &s;hoe is not waxen old upon thy foot,</Q> Deut. xxix. 5. Here ye may &s;ee, the Jews in the Old Te&s;tament, their clothes and their &s;hoes did not wax old: but they, who are Chri&s;t's follow|ers, whom he &s;noeth with his everla&s;ting go&s;pel of peace, and clotheth with his fine linen, his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and arms with his armour, are clothed, &s;hod, and armed, with that which will never decay, wax old, canker, ru&s;t, cor|rupt, nor grow blunt. Now all (whether Chri&s;tians, or Jews, or Gentiles) that hate the light of Chri&s;t, clo&s;e their eyes, and &s;top their ears to it, are not like to &s;ee Chri&s;t their en&s;ign and captain of their &s;alvation, but are blind. As no outward captain would li&s;t a company of blind and deaf men, and clothe and arm them with outward armmour, to &s;uch as are blind and deaf, who&s;e eyes are clo&s;ed, and care &s;lopped to the heavenly light of Chri&s;t, he is not like to clothe with his &s;ine linen, and arm with his heavenly and &s;piritual armour; nor are they like to be &s;piritually

For it is the light, that &s;hines in the heart, which gives the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chri&s;t Je&s;us; who is the en&s;ign and captain of men's &s;al|vations, and who hath brought, and doth bring many &s;ons unto glory: prai&s;es, honour, and glory be unto the Lord over all, who liveth for ever, Amen.</P>

<P>A week after this I returned to London; and after a little &s;tay there, went to vi&s;it friends at King&s;ton, where I &s;taid not long; but came back to London, and remained in the Lord's work, till after the yearly meeting, which was in the fourth month this year; in which the wonted goodne&s;s of the Lord was witne&s;&s;ed, his ble&s;&s;ed pre&s;ence enjoyed, and his heavenly power livingly felt, opening the hearts of his people unto him, and his divine trea&s;ures of life and wi&s;dom in and unto them; whereby many u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary things, relating to the &s;afety of friends, and to the honour and pro&s;perity of truth, were weightily treated of, and una|nimou&s;ly concluded.</P>
<P>After the meeting, I wrote the following paper to friends, to be added to the epi&s;tle, which from the yearly meeting was &s;ent into the &s;everal counties.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL friends every where, that are alive to God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and are living members of Chri&s;t the holy head; be &s;till, and &s;tand &s;till in the Lord's camp of holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and therein &s;ee the &s;alvation of God, and your eternal life, re&s;t, and peace.

Who&s;e name is above every name under the whole heaven, and all his living members know, there is no &s;alvation given by any other name under the whole heaven, but by the name of Je&s;us; and he, their &s;alvation, and their living head, is felt in the mid&s;t of them in his light, life, &s;pirit, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, and truth, and his word of patience, wi&s;dom, and power: who is his peo|ple's prophet, that God hath rai&s;ed up, in his New Te&s;ta|ment and covenant, to open to them; and their living &s;hepherd, that hath purcha&s;ed, redeemed, and bought them with his precious blood. Chri&s;t, the living One, feeds his living &s;heep in his living pa&s;tures of life, and his living &s;heep know their living &s;hepherd's voice, with his living bread and water, and follow him; and will not fol|low any of the world's hirelings, nor thieves, nor robbers, nor climbers, that are without Chri&s;t, the door.

Al&s;o they know Chri&s;t, their holy prie&s;t, that by the grace of God ta&s;ted death for them, and for every man, and is a propitiation for their &s;ins; and not for theirs only, but for the &s;ins of the whole world: and by the one offering up of him&s;elf he hath perfected for ever them that are &s;anctified. Such an high-prie&s;t be|comes Chri&s;t's &s;heep in his new covenant and te&s;tament, who is holy, harmle&s;s, and &s;eparate from &s;inners, and is made higher than the heavens; who is not made a prie&s;t after the order of Aaron with his tithes, offerings, &amp;c. but he makes an end of all tho&s;e things, having aboli&s;hed them, and is made an high-prie&s;t after the power of an endle&s;s life, who ever liveth to make interce&s;&s;ion for his people; and is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, all that come to God through him. He is the one holy mediator betwixt God and man, who &s;anctifies his people, his church, that he is head of, and pre&s;ents them to God without &s;pot, or wrin|kle, or blemi&s;h, or any &s;uch thing; and makes them an holy, royal prie&s;thood, to offer up &s;piritual, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oly &s;acrifices, acceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is King of all kings, and Lord of all lords in the earth.

Chri&s;t, who is &s;et on the right hand of the throne of the Maje&s;ty in the heavens, in his New Te&s;tament and new covenant, is the mini&s;ter of the &s;anctuary and true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man. Therefore all the lambs and &s;heep of Chri&s;t mu&s;t feel this holy mini&s;ter in their temple and &s;anctuary, who mini&s;ters &s;piritual, holy, and heavenly things to them in their &s;anctuary and tabernacle. For all the tabernacles and &s;anctuaries, that are built or pitch'd by man, men make mini&s;ters for them; and &s;uch mini&s;ters are of men and by men, with their worldly &s;anctuaries and tabernacles of men's pitching, by men's hands.</P>

<P>I &s;taid in town between three weeks and a month, after the yearly meeting, and then went to Tottenham-High|Cro&s;s, where was a meeting on fir&s;t-day, which I was at; and then went to Edward Man's at Ford-Green near Winchmore-Hill: and the fir&s;t-day following to the meet|ing at Enfield; where the Lord gave me many precious openings to declare to the people. Afterwards, moving to and fro among&s;t friends thereabouts, I vi&s;ited the meetings at Che&s;shunt, Waltham-Abbey, Enfield, Tottenham, and Winchmore-Hill frequently; the Lord being with me, and opening many deep and weighty truths, divine and heaven|ly my&s;teries to his people through me, to their great re|fre&s;hment, and my joy. After &s;ome time I went to Hert|ford, to vi&s;it friends there; and was at their meeting on a fir&s;t-day. And having &s;omething more particular upon me to the ancient friends of that place, I had a meeting with
<PB N="432" REF="037441_0948_100D94DFD896BD20">&s;ome of them the next day, and imparted to them what the Lord had given me for them. Then pa&s;&s;ing to Ware, I made a little &s;tay among&s;t friends there, and was at their meeting. After which, returning, among&s;t friends about Edmonton &s;ide and Tottenham, and taking meetings as I went, I came back to London in the end of the &s;eventh month.</P>
<P>I remained at London till the beginning of the ninth month, being continually exerci&s;ed in the work of the Lord, either in publick meetings, opening the way of truth to peo|ple, and building up and e&s;tabli&s;hing friends therein, or in other &s;ervices relating to the church of God. For the par|liament now &s;itting, and having a bill before them concern|ing oaths, and another concerning clande&s;tine marriages, &s;everal friends did attend the hou&s;e, to get tho&s;e bills &s;o worded, that they might not be hurtful to friends. In this &s;ervice I al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted, attending on the parliament, and di&s;|cour&s;ing the matter with &s;everal of the members.</P>
<P>Having &s;taid more than a month in London, and much &s;pent my&s;elf in the&s;e &s;ervices, I went to Tottenham, and &s;ome time after to Ford-Green. At which places I con|tinued &s;everal weeks, vi&s;iting friends meetings round about at Tottenham, Enfield, and Winchmore-Hill. In this time &s;everal things came upon me to write: whereof one was an epi&s;tle "to friends in the mini&s;try;" as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>ALL friends in the mini&s;try every where, to whom God hath given a gift of the mini&s;try, and who u&s;e to travel up and down in the gift of the mini&s;try, do not <Q>hide your talent, nor put your light under a bu&s;hel; nor cumber your&s;elves, nor entangle your&s;elves with the af|fairs of this world.</Q> For the natural &s;oldiers are not to cumber them&s;elves with the world; much le&s;s the &s;oldiers of Chri&s;t, who are not of this world; but are to mind the riches and glory of the world that is everla&s;ting. There|fore &s;tir up the gift of God in you, improve it, and do not &s;it down, Demas like, and embrace this pre&s;ent world, that will have an end; le&s;t ye become idolaters. Be va|liant for God's truth upon the earth, and &s;pread it abroad in the day-light of Chri&s;t, you who have &s;ought the king|dom of God, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof, and have re|ceived it and preached it; which <Q>&s;tands in righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t:</Q> As able mini&s;|ters of the Spirit &s;ow to the Spirit, that of the Spirit ye
<PB N="433" REF="037441_0949_100D94E3AAB11B90">may reap life everla&s;ting. Go on in the Spirit, plowing with it in the purifying hope; and thre&s;hing, with the power and Spirit of God, the wheat out of the chaff of corruption, in the &s;ame hope. For he that looks back from the &s;piritual plow into the world, is not fit for the &s;piritual and everla&s;ting kingdom of God; and is not like to pre&s;s into it, as the faithful do. Therefore you that are awakened to righteou&s;ne&s;s, and to the knowledge of the truth, keep your&s;elves awakened in it: then the enemy cannot &s;ow his tares in your field; for truth and righteou&s;|ne&s;s is over him, and before he was. My de&s;ires are, that all may fulfil their mini&s;try, that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath committed to them; and then by the blood (or life) and te&s;timony of Je&s;us you will overcome the enemy that oppo&s;es it, within and without. All you that preach the truth, do it as it is in Je&s;us, in love; and all that are believers in Je&s;us, and receivers of him, he gives them power to become the Sons of God, and joint-heirs with Chri&s;t; whom he calleth brethren; and he gives them the water of life, which &s;hall be a well in them, &s;pringing up to eternal life; that they may water the &s;pi|ritual plants of the living God. So that all may be &s;pirit|ual planters, and &s;piritual waterers; and may &s;ee with the &s;piritual eye the everla&s;ting, eternal God over all to give the increa&s;e, who is the in&s;inite fountain.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>DEAR friends and brethren, mini&s;ters, exhorters, and admoni&s;hers, that are gone into America and the i&s;lands thereaway. Stir up the gift of God in you, and the pure mind, and improve your talents; that ye may be the light of the world, a city &s;et upon an hill, that cannot be hid. Let your light &s;hine among the Indians, the Blacks and the Whites; that ye may an&s;wer the truth in them, and bring them to the &s;tandard and en&s;ign, that God hath &s;et up, Chri&s;t Je&s;us. For from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un to the going down of the &s;ame, God's name &s;hall be great among the Gentiles; and in every temple, or &s;anctified heart, <Q>incen&s;e &s;hall be offered up to God's name.</Q> And have &s;alt in your&s;elves, that ye may be the &s;alt of the earth, that ye may &s;alt it; that it may be pre|&s;erved from corruption and putrefaction: &s;o that all &s;acri|fices offered up to the Lord may be &s;ea&s;oned, and be a good &s;avour to God. All grow in the faith and grace of Chri&s;t, that ye may not be like dwarfs; for a dwarf &s;hall not come near to offer upon God's altar; though he may eat of God's bread, that he may grow by it. And friends, be not negligent, but keep up your Negroes meetings and your family-meetings; and have meeting with the Indian kings, and their councils and &s;ubjects every where, and with others. Bring them all to the baptizing and circum|ci&s;ing Spirit, by which they may know God, and &s;erve and wor&s;hip him. And all take heed of &s;itting down in the earth, and having your minds in the earthly things, coveting and &s;triving for the earth: for to be carnally mind|ed brings death, and covetou&s;ne&s;s is idolatry. There is too much &s;trife and contention about that idol, which makes too many go out of the &s;en&s;e and fear of God; &s;o that &s;ome have lo&s;t morality, humanity; and true Chri&s;|tian charity. O therefore, be awakened to righteou&s;ne&s;s, and keep awakened; for the enemy &s;oweth his tares, while men and women &s;leep in carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and &s;ecurity. There|fore &s;o many &s;lothful ones go in their filthy rags, and have not the fine linen, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; but are &s;traggling, and plowing with their ox and their a&s;s, in their woollen and linen garments, mixt &s;luff feeding upon torn food, and that dieth of it&s;elf, and drinking of the
<PB N="435" REF="037441_0951_100D94E782A82D00">dregs of their old bottle, and eating the four, leavened bread, which makes their hearts burn one again&s;t another. But all are to keep the fea&s;t of Chri&s;t, our pa&s;&s;over, with the unleavened bread of &s;incerity and truth. This un|leavened bread of Life from heaven makes all hearts and &s;ouls glad and joyful, light&s;ome and cheerful, to &s;erve and love God, and to love and &s;erve one another in the peace|able truth, and to keep in the unity of God's Spirit, which is the bond of (the Lord of lords, and the King of kings) peace. In this love and peace God Almighty keep and pre&s;erve all his people, and make them valiant for his truth upon the earth, to &s;pread it abroad in doctrine, good life and conver&s;ation, Amen.</P>
<P>All the members of Chri&s;t have need one of another. For the foot hath need of the hand, and the hand hath need of the foot: the ear hath need of the eye, and the eye of the ear. So that all the members are &s;erviceable in the body which Chri&s;t is the head of; and the head &s;ees their &s;ervice. Therefore let none de&s;pi&s;e the lea&s;t member.</P>
<P>Have a care to keep down that greedy earthly mind, that raveneth and coveteth after the riches and things of this world; le&s;t ye fall into the low region, like the gentiles or heathen, and &s;o lo&s;e the kingdom of God that is everla&s;ting: but &s;eek that fir&s;t, and God knows what ye have need of; who takes care for all both in hea|ven and in the earth: thanks be unto God for his un|&s;peakable gifts, both temporal and &s;piritual!</P>

<P>Not long after I returned to London, and was almo&s;t daily with friends at meetings. When I had been near two weeks in town, the &s;en&s;e of the great hard&s;hips and &s;ore &s;uf|ferings that friends had been and were under in Ireland coming with great weight upon me, I was moved to write the following epi&s;tle, as a word of con&s;olation unto them:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>DEAR friends and brethren in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom the Lord by his eternal arm and power hath upheld through your great &s;ufferings, exerci&s;es, trials, and hard&s;hips (more, I believe, than can be uttered) up and down that nation, which I am very &s;en&s;ible of; and the re&s;t of faithful friends that have been partakers with you
<PB N="436" REF="037441_0952_100D94E9EF66E728">in your &s;ufferings: who cannot but &s;uffer with the Lord's people that &s;uffer. My confidence hath been in the Lord, that he would and will &s;upport you in all your &s;ufferings; and that he would pre&s;erve all the faithful in his wi&s;dom, that they might give no ju&s;t occa&s;ion to one nor other to make them &s;uffer; and if you did &s;uffer wrongfully or un|ju&s;tly, that the righteous God would a&s;&s;i&s;t and uphold you; and reward them according to their works, that op|pre&s;&s;ed or wronged you. And now my de&s;ire is unto the Lord, that in the &s;ame holy and heavenly wi&s;dom of God ye may all be pre&s;erved to the end of your days, to the glory of God, minding his &s;upporting hand and power; who is God All-&s;ufficient, to &s;trengthen, help, and refre&s;h in time of need. Let none forget the Lord's mercies and kindne&s;&s;es, which endure for ever: but always live in the &s;en&s;e of them. And truly, friends, when I con&s;ider the thing, it is the great mercy of the Lord that ye have not been all &s;wallowed up, &s;eeing with what &s;pirits ye have been compa&s;&s;ed about. But the Lord carrieth his lambs in his arms, and they are as tender to him as the apple of his eye; and his power is his hedge about his vineyard of heavenly plants. Therefore it is good for all his children to be given up to the Lord with their minds and &s;ouls, hearts and &s;pirits, who is a faithful keeper, that never &s;lumbers nor &s;leeps; but is able to pre&s;erve and keep you, and to &s;ave to the utmo&s;t, and none can hurt &s;o much as an hair of your heads, except he &s;uffer it, to try you; for he upholds all things in heaven and earth, by the Word of his power: all things were made by Chri&s;t: and by him all things con&s;i&s;t (mark, con&s;i&s;t) whether they be vi&s;i|bles or invi&s;ibles, &amp;c. So he hath power over all; for all power in heaven and earth is given to him: and to you, the have received him, he hath given power to become the &s;ons and daughters of God; &s;o living members of Chri&s;t, the living head, grafted into him in whom ye have eternal life. Chri&s;t the Seed reigns, and his power is over all; who brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head, and de&s;troys the devil and his works, and was before he was. So all of you live and walk in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; that nothing may be between you and God, but Chri&s;t, in whom ye have &s;alvation, life, re&s;t, and peace with God.</P>
<P>As for the affairs of truth in this land and abroad, I hear, that in Holland and Germany, and thereaway, friends are in love, unity, and peace: and in Jamaica, Barbadoes,
<PB N="437" REF="037441_0953_100D94ECA0F86630">Nevis, Antigua, Maryland, and New England, I hear nothing, but friends are in unity and peace.

<HEAD>DEATH AND BURIAL.</HEAD>
<P>THUS, reader, thou ha&s;t had &s;ome account of the life and travels, labours, &s;ufferings, and manifold trials and exerci&s;es of this holy man of God, from his youth to al|mo&s;t the time of his death: Of which him&s;elf kept a jour|nal; whence the foregoing &s;heets were tran&s;cribed. It re|mains, that an account be added of the time, place, and manner of his death and burial; which was thus:
The next day, after he had written the foregoing epi&s;tle to friends in Ireland, he went to the meeting at Grace-church-&s;treet, which was large (it being on the fir&s;t-day of the week): and the Lord enabled him to preach the truth fully and effectually, opening many deep and weighty things with great power and clearne&s;s. After which hav|ing prayed, and the meeting being ended, he went to Hen|ry Gouldney's (a friend's hou&s;e in White-hart Court, near the meeting-hou&s;e): and &s;ome friends going with him, he told them, <Q>He thought he felt the cold &s;trike to his heart, as he came out of the meeting;</Q> yet added, <Q>I am glad I was here; now I am clear, I am fully clear.</Q> As &s;oon as tho&s;e friends were withdrawn, he laid down upon a bed &s;as he &s;ometimes u&s;ed to do, through wearine&s;s after a meet|ing) but &s;oon ro&s;e again; and in a little time laid down again, complaining &s;till of cold. And his &s;trength &s;en&s;ibly decaying, he was fain &s;oon after to go into the bed; where he lay in much contentment and peace, and very &s;en&s;ible to the la&s;t. And as, in the whole cour&s;e of his life, his &s;pirit, in the univer&s;al love of God, was &s;et and bent for the
<PB N="438" REF="037441_0954_100D94EE347E4350">exalting of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the making known the way thereof to the nations and people afar off; &s;o now, in the time of his outward weakne&s;s, his mind was intent upon, and wholly taken up with that: and he &s;ent for &s;ome particular friends, to whom he expre&s;&s;ed his mind, and de|&s;ire for the &s;preading friends books, and truth thereby in the world. Divers friends came to vi&s;it him in his illne&s;s, unto &s;ome of whom he &s;aid, <Q>All is well: the Seed of God reigns over all, and over death it&s;elf. And though,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I am weak in body: yet the power of God is over all, and the Seed reigns over all di&s;orderly &s;pirits.</Q> Thus lying in an heavenly frame of mind, his &s;pirit wholly exer|ci&s;ed towards the Lord, he grew weaker and weaker in his natural &s;trength; and on the third day of that week, be|tween the hours of nine and ten in the evening, he quietly departed this life in peace, and &s;weetly fell a&s;leep in the Lord, who&s;e ble&s;&s;ed truth he had livingly and powerfully preached in the meeting but two days before. Thus ended he his day in his faithful te&s;timony, in perfect love and unity with his brethren, and in peace and good-will to all men, on the 13th of the 11th month 1690, being then in the 67th year of his age.</P>
<P>Upon the 16th of the &s;ame month (being the &s;ixth of the week, and the day appointed for his funeral) a very great concour&s;e of friends, and other people of divers &s;orts, a&s;&s;em|bled together at the meeting-hou&s;e in White-hart Court near Gracechurch-&s;treet, about the middle time of the day, in order to attend his body to the grave. The meeting was held about two hours with great and heavenly &s;olemnity, mani|fe&s;tly attended with the Lord's ble&s;&s;ed pre&s;ence and glorious power; in which divers living te&s;timonies were delivered, from a lively remembrance and &s;en&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ed mini&s;try of this dear and ancient &s;ervant of the Lord, his early en|tering into the Lord's work at the breaking forth of this go&s;|pel day, his innocent life, long and great travels, and un|wearied labours of love in the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, for the turning and gathering many thou&s;ands from darkne&s;s to the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the foundation of true faith; the mani|fold &s;ufferings, afflictions, and oppo&s;itions, which he met withal for his faithful te&s;timony, both from his open adver|&s;aries and from fal&s;e brethren; and his pre&s;ervations, deli|verances, and dominion in, out of, and over them all, by the power of God: to whom the glory and honour always was by him, and is and always ought to be by all a&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="037441_0955_100D94F04E6EEA70">
After the meeting was ended, his body was borne by friends, and accompanied by very great numbers, to friends burying-ground near Bunhill fields: where, after a &s;olemn waiting upon the Lord, and &s;everal living te&s;timonies borne, recommending the company to the guidance and protection of that divine Spirit and power, by which this holy man of God had been rai&s;ed up, furni&s;hed, &s;upported and pre&s;erv|ed to the end of his day, his body was decently committed to the earth; but his memorial &s;hall remain, and be ever|la&s;tingly ble&s;&s;ed among the righteous.</P>

<P>KEEP all your meetings in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, that be gathered in his name by his light, grace, truth, power, and Spirit; by which you will feel his ble&s;|&s;ed and refre&s;hing pre&s;ence among you and in you, to your comfort and God's glory.</P>
<P>And now friends, all your meetings, both men's and women's, monthly, quarterly, and yearly, &amp;c. were &s;et up by the power, Spirit, and wi&s;dom of God; and in them you know that you have felt his power, and Spi|rit, and wi&s;dom, and ble&s;&s;ed refre&s;hing pre&s;ence among you, and in you, to his prai&s;e and glory, and your com|fort: &s;o that you have been a <Q>city &s;et on a hill, that cannot be hid.</Q></P>
<P>And although many loo&s;e and unruly &s;pirits have ri&s;en betimes to oppo&s;e you and them, in print and other ways, you have &s;een how they have come to nought. The Lord hath bla&s;ted them, brought their deeds to light, and
<PB N="440" REF="037441_0956_100D94F1E5B3A838">made them manife&s;t to be trees without fruit, wells with|out water, wandering &s;tars from the firmament of God's power, and raging waves of the &s;ea, ca&s;ting up their mire and dirt; and many of them are like the dog turned to his old vomit, and the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed, turned again to the mire.

<P>All children of New Jeru&s;alem, that de&s;cends from above, the holy city, which the Lord and the Lamb is the light of, and is the temple; in it they are born again of the Spirit: &s;o Jeru&s;alem that is above, is the mother of them that are born of the Spirit.

<HEAD>A narrative of the &s;preading of truth, and of the oppo&s;ition from the powers which then were, written by George Fox, in the year 1676.</HEAD>
<P>THE truth &s;prang up fir&s;t to us, &s;o as to be a people to the Lord, in Leice&s;ter&s;hire in 1644, in War|wick&s;hire in 1645, in Nottingham&s;hire in 1646, in Derby|&s;hire in 1647, and in the adjacent counties in 1648, 1649, and 1650; in York&s;hire in 1651, in Lanca&s;hire and We&s;t|moreland in 1652, in Cumberland, Durham, and Nor|thumberland in 1653, in London and mo&s;t of the other parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, in 1654.</P>
<P>In 1655 many went beyond &s;ea, where truth al&s;o &s;prang up, and in 1656 it broke forth in America and many other places.</P>
<P>In the authority of this divine truth friends &s;tood all the cruelties and &s;ufferings that were inflicted upon them by the long parliament; to the &s;poiling of goods, impri&s;on|ment, and death, and over all reproaches, lies, and &s;lan|ders; as well as tho&s;e in Oliver Cromwell's time, and all the acts made by him and his parliament; his &s;on Richard after him, and the committee of &s;afety; and after with&s;tood and outla&s;ted all the acts and proclamations &s;ince 1660, that the king came in.</P>
<P>Friends never feared their acts, pri&s;ons, gaols, hou&s;es of correction, bani&s;hment, nor &s;poiling of goods, nay, nor the lo&s;s of life it&s;elf; nor was there ever any per&s;ecution that came, but we &s;aw in the event in would be productive of good; nor were there ever any pri&s;ons that I was in, or &s;ufferings, but it was for the bringing multitudes out of pri&s;on; though they who impri&s;oned the truth, and quenched the Spirit in them&s;elves, would impri&s;on and quench it without them; &s;o that there was a time when &s;o many were in pri&s;on, that it became as a bye-word, <Q>truth is &s;carce any where to be found but in gaols.</Q></P>
<P>And after the king came in, divers friends &s;uffered much, becau&s;e they would not drink his health, and &s;ay, "God ble&s;s the king;" &s;o that many friends were in danger of their lives from rude per&s;ons, who were ready to run them through with their &s;words for refu&s;ing it, until the king gave forth a proclamation again&s;t drinking healths;
<PB N="443" REF="037441_0959_100D94F8CBFC4490">for we were and are again&s;t drinking any healths, and all exce&s;s, both before his coming in and after; and we de|&s;ire the king's good, and that the ble&s;&s;ing of God might come upon him and all his &s;ubjects, and all people upon the face of the earth; but we did de&s;ire people not to drink the king's health, but let him have his health, and all people el&s;e; and to drink for their own health and nece&s;&s;ity only; for that way of drinking healths, and to exce&s;s, was not for the king's health <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their own, nor any others; which exce&s;s often brought forth quarrelling and de&s;troying one another: for they de&s;troyed the crea|tion and one another; and this was not for the king's wealth, nor health, nor honour, but might grieve him to have the creatures and his &s;ubjects de&s;troyed; and &s;o the Lord's power gave us dominion over that al&s;o, and all our other &s;ufferings. But,</P>
<P>Oh! the number of &s;ufferers in the commonwealth's and Oliver Cromwel's days, and &s;ince; e&s;pecially tho&s;e who were haled before the courts for not paying tithes, re|fu&s;ing to &s;wear on their juries, not putting off their hats, and for going to meetings on the fir&s;t-days; under pre|tence of breaking the &s;abbath; and to meetings on other days of the week; who were abu&s;ed both in meetings and on the highways.</P>
<P>Oh! how great were the &s;ufferings we then &s;u&s;tained up|on the&s;e accounts! for &s;ometimes they would drive friends by droves into the pri&s;on-hou&s;es like pen&s;olds, confine them on the fir&s;t-days, and take their hor&s;es from them, and keep them for pretended breach of their &s;abbath, though they would ride in their coaches and upon their fat hor&s;es to the &s;teeple-hou&s;es them&s;elves, and yet puni&s;h others. And many friends were turned out of their copy-holds and cu&s;tomary tenements, becau&s;e in obedience to the command of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tle, they could not &s;wear; and as they went to meetings, they have been &s;toned through the &s;treets, and otherwi&s;e cruelly abu&s;ed. Many were fined with great fines, and lay long in pri&s;on for not putting off their hats, which fines friends could never pay, though they kept them in pri&s;on till they had &s;atisfied their own wills, and at la&s;t turned them out, af|ter keeping them a year or more in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Many books I gave forth again&s;t tithes, &s;hewing how the prie&s;thood was changed that took them; and that Chri&s;t &s;ent forth his twelve, and afterwards &s;eventy di&s;ci|ples,
<PB N="444" REF="037441_0960_100D94FADD279F80">&s;aying unto them, <Q>Freely ye have received, freely give.</Q> So all who do not obey the doctrine and com|mand of Chri&s;t therein, we cannot receive them.</P>
<P>I was al&s;o moved to give forth &s;everal books again&s;t &s;wearing, and that our Yea and Nay might be taken in|&s;tead of an oath, which if we broke, let us &s;uffer the &s;ame puni&s;hment as they who broke their oaths. And in Ja|maica the governor and the a&s;&s;embly granted the thing; it is al&s;o granted in &s;ome other places; and &s;everal of the parliament-men in England have acknowledged the rea|&s;onablene&s;s thereof. The magi&s;trates, after &s;ome time, when they &s;aw our faithfulne&s;s in Yea and Nay, they who were moderate, both before and &s;ince the king came in, would put friends into offices without an oath; but the cruel and envious would fine friends to get money of them, though they could not pay them any.</P>
<P>Thus the Lord's power hath carried us through all, and over all, to his everla&s;ting glory and prai&s;e; for God's power bath been our hedge, our wall and our keeper (the pre&s;erver of his plants and vineyard) who have not had the magi&s;trates &s;word and &s;taff to help us, nor ever tru&s;ted in the arm of fle&s;h, but have gone without the&s;e, or Judas's bag, to preach the word of life, which was in the beginning before they were; which word reconciles to God. And thou&s;ands have received this word of reconci|liation, and are born again of the immortal Seed, by the Word of God; and are feeding upon the milk of the word, which lives and abides for ever.</P>
<P>Many have &s;uffered death for their te&s;timony, in Eng|land and beyond the &s;eas, both before and &s;ince the king came in; which may be &s;een in an account given to the king and both hou&s;es of parliament; being a brief, plain, and true relation of the late and &s;ad &s;ufferings of the peo|ple of God in &s;corn called Quakers, for wor&s;hipping and exerci&s;ing a good con&s;cience towards God and man.</P>
<P>By rea&s;on whereof eighty-nine have &s;uffered till death, thirty-two of which died before the king came into Eng|land, and fifty-&s;even &s;ince, by hard impri&s;onment and cruel u&s;age. Forty-three have died in the city of London and Southwark &s;ince the Act made again&s;t meetings, &amp;c. about 1661, of which a more particular account was given, with the names of the &s;ufferers to the king and parliament, about 1663.</P>
<P>And though divers laws were de&s;igned again&s;t us, yet
<PB N="445" REF="037441_0961_100D94FE8BE63420">never could any of them ju&s;tly touch us, being wre&s;ted and mi&s;applied in their execution by our adver&s;aries, which &s;ome have been made to confe&s;s. All tho&s;e laws that were made, and the oath which they impri&s;oned us for, becau&s;e, in obedience to the command of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, we could not &s;wear at all, were not originally intended again&s;t us; and yet we &s;uffered by the &s;everal powers, and their laws, both &s;poiling of goods and impri&s;onment, even to death. And the governor of Dover ca&s;tle, when the king a&s;ked him if he had di&s;per&s;ed all the &s;ectaries meet|ings? &s;aid, that he had; but the Quakers, the devil him|&s;elf could not; for if he did impri&s;on them, and break up their meetings, they would meet again; and if he &s;hould beat them or knock them down, or kill &s;ome of them, all was one, they would meet, and not re&s;i&s;t again. Thus the Lord's power did &s;upport and keep them over their per&s;ecutors, and made them to ju&s;tify our patience and lamb-like nature. This was about 1671.</P>
<P>Since the king came in, three acts have been made again&s;t us, be&s;ides the proclamations, by which many have &s;uffered impri&s;onment and bani&s;hment, and many to death. And yet for all the&s;e acts and proclamations, per&s;ecutions, &s;ufferings, bani&s;hments, faithful friends are as fre&s;h as ever in the Lord's power, and valiant for his name and truth.</P>
<P>Some weak ones there were, when the king came in, who did take the oath; but after they had &s;o done, they were &s;ore troubled for di&s;obeying the command of Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tle, and went to the magi&s;trates, condemned them&s;elves, and offered to go to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus the Lord, in his everla&s;ting power hath been the &s;upport and &s;tay of his people; and &s;till his Seed reigns, his truth is over all, and exceedingly &s;preads unto this year 1676.</P>

<HEAD>A warning to the magi&s;trates and people of the city of Oldenburg:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVE you &s;een and felt the judgments of God upon your city, the Lord &s;ending lightning from heaven, that de&s;troyed and burnt it? As I pa&s;&s;ed through your city on a fir&s;t-day of the week, which you call your &s;ab|bath, I &s;aw &s;ome drinking, &s;oldiers playing at &s;huffle-board, and others with their &s;hops open, and trading,
<PB N="446" REF="037441_0962_100D95001FE534F8">when they &s;hould have been waiting upon God, and wor|&s;hipping him; and your people were light and vain, with|out any &s;en&s;e of God's judgments, or repentance. O therefore repent, le&s;t the all-&s;eeing God, who &s;ees all your actions, and is over all, bring &s;wift judgment upon you in his wrath, fury, and indignation. Repent, and lay a&s;ide all manner of evil, wickedne&s;s, ungodline&s;s, and unright|eou&s;ne&s;s: for the day of the Lord will come upon all that do evil, all the workers of iniquity. This mighty day of the Lord will find them all out, and will burn as an oven; burn up all the proud and wicked, and neither leave them root nor branch. Therefore all ye magi&s;trates, prie&s;ts, and people, &s;earch in your&s;elves to find out the cau&s;e, and what evil you have committed, that has brought the wrath, vengeance, and judgments of God upon you and your city, in burning of it. All return, and come to the light of Chri&s;t in your hearts, to God's &s;pirit, to the grace and truth in your hearts, that comes by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that with it ye may &s;earch your hearts. Do not grieve, nor vex, nor quench God's good Spirit in your hearts; walk not de&s;pitefully again&s;t the Spirit of grace, nor turn from it into wantonne&s;s; and yet make a profe&s;&s;ion of God and Chri&s;t in words, when your hearts are afar off, living in plea&s;ures, and wantonly upon the earth, &s;porting your|&s;elves, killing the ju&s;t, crucifying to your&s;elves Chri&s;t afre&s;h, and putting him to open &s;hame; &s;o di&s;honouring God. Chri&s;t, and chri&s;tianity, yet making a profe&s;&s;ion and a trade of the &s;criptures; keeping people always learn|ing, that they may be always paying.</P>
<P>Cea&s;e from man, who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils, and look unto the Lord, all ye ends of the earth, and be &s;av|ed; for the Lord God of heaven and earth is come to teach his people him&s;elf by his light, Spirit, grace, and truth, and to bring them off all the world's teachers. God hath rai&s;ed up Chri&s;t Je&s;us his prophet, whom peo|ple &s;hould hear; and &s;aith, <Q>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him:</Q> and Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>Learn of me, I am the way, the truth, and the life; and no man comes to the Father, but by me.</Q> There is no &s;alvation by any other name under the whole heaven, but by the name of Je&s;us, who &s;aith, <Q>I am the good Shepherd, and have laid down my life for my &s;heep, and my &s;heep hear my voice and follow me, and will not follow the hireling:</Q> for Chri&s;t feeds them in the pa&s;tures of life, that will never wither.
<PB N="447" REF="037441_0963_100D950293DB2910">God hath anointed Chri&s;t Je&s;us to preach, if you will hear him; and God hath given Chri&s;t for a coun&s;ellor and a leader, if you will be led and coun&s;elled by him; and God hath given Chri&s;t for a bi&s;hop to over&s;ee you, and a king to rule you, if you will be over&s;een and ruled by him. You that will not have Chri&s;t to rule over you, who never &s;inned, nor was guile found in his mouth, you may read his &s;entence in the New Te&s;tament upon &s;uch. Is not Chri&s;t a &s;ufficient teacher, who&s;e blood was &s;hed for you, and ta&s;ted death for every man? Doth not Chri&s;t &s;ay to his mini&s;ters, "Freely ye have received, freely give?" And the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>We covet no man's gold, &s;ilver, or apparel.</Q> They laboured with their hands, and kept the go&s;pel without charge. Have they that are called mi|ni&s;ters among&s;t you done the &s;ame, and kept this command of Chri&s;t Je&s;us? Let them be examined, and examine them&s;elves. Have you not trimmed your out&s;ides? but look within with the light and Spirit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and &s;ee if your in&s;ides be not black and foul. For Chri&s;t Je|&s;us, who doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world with the life in him&s;elf, &s;aith, <Q>Believe in the light, that ye may become children of the light.</Q> With the light ye may &s;ee all the evil and ungodly deeds that ye have committed, all your ungodly words you have &s;po|ken, and all your ungodly thoughts ye think; that ye may turn from them to Chri&s;t, from whence the light comes: who is your Saviour and Redeemer, who hath given you a light to &s;ee your &s;in, and that you are dead in Adam; that with the &s;ame light you may &s;ee Chri&s;t, the quickening Spirit, who makes you alive to God, and &s;aves you from your &s;in. But if you hate the light, which is the life in Chri&s;t, the Prince of life; and love the dark|ne&s;s and the prince of darkne&s;s more than the light or the life in Chri&s;t, becau&s;e it will reprove you; Chri&s;t tells you, "This light will be your condemnation," John. iii. Therefore be warned now in your day. While you have time, turn to the Lord. Do not quench the Spirit of the Father, by which he draws to his Son; nor hate the light of Chri&s;t; for if you do, you hate the life in Chri&s;t, and &s;o remain under condemnation from God and Chri&s;t with the light, who now &s;peaks to his people by his Son, as he did in the apo&s;tle's days; the &s;ame God, that was the &s;peaker by the prophets to the fathers, and &s;peaker to Adam and Eve in paradi&s;e: and happy had Adam and Eve, and
<PB N="448" REF="037441_0964_100D95042FFAEDB0">the Jews, and all Chri&s;tians been, if they had kept to this &s;peaker, and not have followed the &s;erpent, that fal&s;e &s;peak|er, and his in&s;truments. And now God is the true &s;peak|er by his Son, who brui&s;es the head of the &s;erpent, the fal&s;e teacher, the head of all fal&s;e ways, fal&s;e prophets, fal&s;e churches, and fal&s;e religions and wor&s;hips. So God in Chri&s;t is bringing people to the pure undefiled religion, that will keep them from the &s;pots of the world, into the new and living way Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and to the Church in God, which Chri&s;t is the head of, as he was in the apo&s;|tles days; and to wor&s;hip God in the Spirit and truth, which wor&s;hip Chri&s;t &s;et up above &s;ixteen hundred years &s;ince. Therefore mu&s;t all people come to the grace and Spirit of truth in their own hearts, to know the God of truth, who is a Spirit, and in the Spirit and truth to wor|&s;hip, &s;erve, honour, and glorify the living God, who is over all, and worthy of all, ble&s;&s;ed for evermore, Amen!</P>
<P>Ye magi&s;trates and officers, read this in all your a&s;&s;em|blies, and cau&s;e all your prie&s;ts to read it in their churches; that they and you, and all people may hear and fear the God of heaven, as you will an&s;wer it at the great and ter|rible day of judgment, and vengeance of the Lord God Almighty. This is in love to your &s;ouls, and for your temporal and eternal good.</P>

<HEAD>An epi&s;tle concerning true fa&s;ting, true prayer, true ho|nour, and again&s;t per&s;ecution, and for the true liberty in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; that all may have a care that the apo&s;|tle hath not be&s;towed his labour in vain upon you in your ob&s;erving of days, months, times, fea&s;ts, and years, and of coming under the beggarly elements, and the yoke of bondage again, and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ringing and forcing people into them.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE did ever Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles command any believers or Chri&s;tians to ob&s;erve holy-days or fea&s;t-days? Let us &s;ee where it is written in the New Te&s;tament, in the four evangeli&s;ts, the epi&s;tles, or the Revelation, that ever Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles commanded Chri&s;tians to ob&s;erve the time called Chri&s;tmas, or a day for Chri&s;t's birth? or to ob&s;erve the time called Ea&s;ter,
<PB N="449" REF="037441_0965_100D9507906FDED8">or Whitfuntide, or Peter's, Paul's, Mark's, or Luke's, or any other &s;aint's day?</P>
<P>You, that profe&s;s your&s;elves to be reformed churches from the Papi&s;ts, Jews, and Heathens, and the &s;criptures to be your rule, and are profe&s;&s;ors of the new covenant, where do you prove out of the New Te&s;tament, that the apo&s;tles and the primitive church practi&s;ed or forced any &s;uch thing, or that Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles gave any &s;uch command to the churches, that they &s;hould practi&s;e and ob&s;erve any &s;uch days? Let us &s;ee where this command is written. Did not the apo&s;tle &s;ay to the Galatians in the fourth chapter, <Q>But now, after that ye have known God, or rather ye are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye de&s;ire again to be in bondage? Ye ob&s;erve days, and months, and times, and years; I am afraid of you, le&s;t I have be&s;tow|ed upon you labour in vain.</Q> And in the third of Gala|tians it is &s;aid, <Q>O fooli&s;h Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you &s;hould not obey the truth,</Q> &amp;c. And in Galatians the fifth, the apo&s;tle exhorts them to <Q>&s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made them free:</Q> and moreover &s;aid, <Q>Be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</Q></P>
<P>Doth not this manife&s;t there were &s;ome teachers that were drawing the church of the Galatians into the&s;e beg|garly elements, and bringing them again into bondage, in ob&s;erving of days, months, times, and years? It was the apo&s;tle's work to bring them out of tho&s;e bondages and beggarly elements; therefore when they were going back again into ob&s;erving days, months, times, and years, he was afraid that he had <Q>be&s;towed his labour upon them in vain:</Q> and he exhorts them to <Q>&s;tand fa&s;t in the liber|ty wherewith Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath made them free, and not to be entangled again with the yoke of bondage:</Q> and again &s;ignifies, <Q>that they had been once entangled with that yoke of bondage and beggarly elements.</Q> But O! how are people, called Chri&s;tians, &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, gone again under this yoke of bondage, and the&s;e beggarly elements, in ob&s;erving days, months, times, and years, let their practice declare. Nay, do not both Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants force people to ob&s;erve days, months, and times? And therefore is not the apo&s;tle's labour and tra|vail be&s;towed upon Chri&s;tendom in vain, which was to bring people from under &s;uch beggarly elements and that
<PB N="450" REF="037441_0966_100D950A18D577B8">yoke of bondage (which the law did require) to <Q>&s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made them free, and not to be entangled again with the yoke of bondage?</Q> It was and is Chri&s;t that hath made and doth make his people free from the&s;e beggarly elements; therefore the re|deemed are to <Q>&s;tand fa&s;t in that liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made them free.</Q> This liberty all true Chri&s;tians are to &s;tand fa&s;t in; they are made free by Chri&s;t, and not by man; for man, without the Spirit and mind of Chri&s;t, &s;eeks to force and compel Chri&s;t's followers, &s;uch as he hath made free from the yoke of bondage, to outward things that the law commanded, to the ob&s;erving of days, months, times, fea&s;ts, and years. From &s;uch weak, beg|garly elements, tho&s;e that know God, or are known of God and Chri&s;t, are to &s;tand fa&s;t in their liberty, and not come under nor be entangled with the yoke of bondage again, &s;eeing he hath made them free. For they that are in &s;uch things, and would force others to them, are gone from that which gives the knowledge of God, and have not &s;tood fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t makes free.</P>
<P>Concerning prayer, we do not read that ever Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles did &s;eek by force to compel any to fa&s;t or pray with them. But Chri&s;t taught them how they &s;hould pray, and be di&s;tinct from the hypocrites. His words are as followeth: <Q>When thou praye&s;t, thou &s;halt not be as the hypocrites are; for they love to &s;tand praying in the &s;ynagogues, and in the corners of the &s;treets, that they may be &s;een of men, &amp;c. But when thou praye&s;t, enter into thy clo&s;et, and when thou ha&s;t &s;hut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in &s;ecret, and thy Father, that &s;eeth in &s;ecret, will reward thee openly. But when you pray, u&s;e not vain repetitions, as the heathen do; for they think that they &s;hall be heard for their much &s;peaking. Be not ye therefore like them; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye a&s;k him,</Q> &amp;c. As the apo&s;tles and &s;aints did, &s;o do we; we pray in &s;ecret, and we pray in publick, as the &s;pirit gives us utterance, which helps our infirmities, as it did the apo&s;tles and true Chri&s;|tians: after this manner we pray for our&s;elves, and for all men both high and low.</P>
<P>Concerning fa&s;ting, Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>Moreover when ye fa&s;t, be not as the hypocrites, of a &s;ad countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fa&s;t. But when thou fa&s;te&s;t, anoint thy head, and
<PB N="451" REF="037441_0967_100D950BAD75DCF8">wa&s;h thy face, that thou appear not unto men to fa&s;t, but unto thy Father which is in &s;ecret; and thy Father, which &s;eeth in &s;ecret, &s;hall reward thee openly.</Q></P>
<P>You may &s;ee in I&s;aiah lviii, what the true fa&s;t the Lord requires is, where it is &s;aid to the prophet, <Q>Cry aloud, and &s;pare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and &s;hew my people their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and the hou&s;e of Jacob their &s;ins; yet they &s;eek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteou&s;ne&s;s, and for&s;ook not the ordinance of their God; they a&s;k of me the ordi|nances of ju&s;tice, they take delight in approaching to God. Wherefore have we fa&s;ted, &s;ay they, and thou &s;ee&s;t not? Wherefore have we afflicted our &s;oul, and thou take&s;t no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fa&s;t ye find plea&s;ure, and exact all your labours. Behold, ye fa&s;t for &s;trife and debate, and to &s;mite with the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s; ye &s;hall not fa&s;t as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. Is it &s;uch a fa&s;t that I have cho&s;en? A day for a man to afflict his &s;oul? Is it to bow down his head as a bulru&s;h, and to &s;pread &s;ack-cloth and a&s;hes under him? Wilt thou call this a fa&s;t, and an acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the fa&s;t that I have cho&s;en, &s;aith the Lord; to loo&s;e the bands of wickedne&s;s, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</Q> So this fa&s;t that the Lord requires, is not to lay yokes, to oppre&s;s, and lay heavy burdens, and to make fa&s;t the bands of wickedne&s;s; but to loo&s;e and break &s;uch things.</P>
<P>Further, Concerning the true fa&s;t the Lord requires, <Q>Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor, that are ca&s;t out, to thy hou&s;e? When thou &s;ee&s;t the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy&s;elf from thy own fle&s;h? (Do you keep this true fa&s;t?) Then &s;hall thy light break forth as the morn|ing, and thine health &s;hall &s;pring forth &s;peedily: and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall go before thee, the glory of the Lord &s;hall be thy rereward. Then &s;halt thou call, and the Lord &s;hall an&s;wer; thou &s;halt cry, and he &s;hall &s;ay, Here I am: If thou take away from the mid&s;t of thee the yokes, the putting forth of the finger, and &s;peaking vanity; and if thou draw out thy &s;oul to the hungry, and &s;atisfy the afflicted &s;oul; then &s;hall thy light ari&s;e out of ob&s;curity, and thy darkne&s;s be as the noon-day. And the Lord &s;hall guide thee continually, and &s;atisfy thy &s;oul in
<PB N="452" REF="037441_0968_100D950D486619C8">drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou &s;halt be like a watered garden, and like a &s;pring of water, who&s;e wa|ters fail not,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here is the practice of the true fa&s;t the Lord requires of his people; and to them that ob&s;erve this fa&s;t, the Lord &s;aith, "When they call, he will an&s;wer." You may &s;ee what glorious and happy comforts they receive from the Lord, that keep this true fa&s;t; but &s;uch as fa&s;t for &s;trife and debate, and to &s;mite with the fi&s;ts of wickedne&s;s, <Q>to make their voices to be heard on high, to afflict their &s;ouls for a day, to bow down their head as a bulru&s;h, and loo&s;e not the bands of wickedne&s;s, nor undo every heavy burden, break off every yoke, and let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free, that does not deal his bread to the hungry, clothe the naked, and bring the poor to his hou&s;e, but hides him&s;elf from his own fle&s;h;</Q> &s;uch fa&s;ts and fa&s;ters the Lord doth not accept, neither hath he cho&s;en them. The&s;e appear to men with their disfigured faces, hanging down their heads as a bulru&s;h for a day, like the hypo|crites, to fa&s;t, as Chri&s;t &s;peaks in Matth. vi.</P>
<P>Is it not the command of Chri&s;t, that in their fa&s;t they &s;hould not appear unto men to fa&s;t? And now you, that would force us to &s;hut up our &s;hops on fa&s;ting-days, or for a day, does not this fa&s;t appear to men? and is not this the fa&s;t, that the Lord &s;aith in I&s;aiah, <Q>he doth not accept?</Q> for he &s;aith, <Q>Is this the fa&s;t that I have cho|&s;en, a day for a man to afflict his &s;oul, and bow down his head as a bulru&s;h,</Q> &amp;c. <Q>Wilt thou call this a fa&s;t, and an acceptable day to the Lord?.</Q> I&s;a. lviii.</P>
<P>Therefore all God's people are to keep the true fa&s;t of the Lord from debate and &s;trife, and the fi&s;ts of wicked|ne&s;s; that <Q>fa&s;t that breaks the bands of wickedne&s;s, un|does every heavy burden, breaks every yoke, lets the op|pre&s;&s;ed go free, deals bread to the hungry, clothes the naked, and brings the poor that are ca&s;t out to his own hou&s;e.</Q> Every one that keeps this true fa&s;t, their health &s;hall grow, and when they call, the Lord will hear them; <Q>he will be their guide continually, &s;atisfy their &s;ouls in drought, make their bones fat, and they &s;hall be like a wa|tered garden, and like a &s;pring of water, who&s;e waters fail not.</Q> Now you, that keep not this true fa&s;t, when you call upon the Lord on your own fa&s;ting-days, does the Lord an&s;wer you, and &s;ay, "Here I am?" Doth the Lord guide you continually? Are your bones made fat
<PB N="453" REF="037441_0969_100D9510083AC7F0">by him, and your &s;ouls &s;atisfied in drought? Are you like a watered garden, and like a &s;pring who&s;e waters fail not? You that keep not this true fa&s;t, do you not want the&s;e waters which fail not? &s;o your &s;ouls are not &s;atisfied in drought, but your bones are lean, and you hear not the voice of the Lord, who &s;aith, "Here I am:" &s;o you lo&s;e the heritage of Jacob, and ride not upon the high|places there; but come under. Therefore every man and woman, &s;hut your hearts again&s;t all manner of evil what&s;oever, and trade not with Babylon's merchants of confu&s;ion; but keep the &s;upernatural day of Chri&s;t, that is &s;prung from on high, that is kept by believing and walk|ing in the light of Chri&s;t, and being grafted into him. This will bring you to the true fa&s;t, from &s;eeding upon any evil, and to the true praying in the Spirit, as Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles have taught. The fruit of the Spirit is love, &amp;c. The birth of the Spirit is not a per&s;ecuting birth; but he that is born of the fle&s;h will per&s;ecute him that is born of the Spirit, becau&s;e he will not follow the birth of the fle&s;h, with its weak, beggarly elements, that entangles with its yoke of bondage, and its ob&s;erving of days, months, times, fa&s;ts, fea&s;ts, and years: which the birth of the Spirit is to &s;tand fa&s;t again&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made it free.</P>
<P>Do you not know that the Turks keep their &s;abbath on the &s;ixth-day, the Jews upon the &s;eventh-day, and the Chri&s;tians meet together on the fir&s;t-day of the week? And that day, which the Turks keep, the Jews and Chri&s;|tians &s;hops are open; and that day the Jews keep, Chri&s;|tians and Turks &s;hops are open; and the fir&s;t-days, that the Chri&s;tians keep, both Jews and Turks &s;hops are open? The Turk does not force the Jews nor the Chri&s;tians to &s;hut up their &s;hops on their meeting-days, but lets them have their liberty in Turkey. And where do you read that ever the Turks forced any Chri&s;tians to ob&s;erve any of their holy days, fa&s;ts, or fea&s;ts? If not, &s;hould not Chri&s;tians be beyond the Turks in giving liberty to all tender con&s;ciences to &s;erve God, &s;eeing Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles command not nor force people to ob&s;erve holy days, or times, or months, or years, but &s;hould pray al|ways in the Spirit, and fa&s;t always from &s;trife and debate, from all manner of &s;in and evil; and that will keep down the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s, and the bond of iniquity? Why &s;hould not people of a tender con&s;cience have their
<PB N="454" REF="037441_0970_100D95119C9B70C8">liberty to exerci&s;e their con&s;ciences towards God, that they may have a <Q>good con&s;cience always, towards God and man,</Q> to perform that which God requires, and <Q>to do unto all men as they would have them to do unto them, and to love their neighbours as them&s;elves;</Q> &s;eeing &s;o many debauched, evil and &s;eared con&s;ciences, as with an hot iron, have liberty in their loo&s;e lives and conver&s;a|tions, and in their loo&s;e words, who&s;e tongues are at liberty to &s;wear and cur&s;e, and their &s;pirits at liberty in drunken|ne&s;s and uncleanne&s;s? Let the magi&s;trates look and &s;ee how this evil &s;eared con&s;cience hath its liberty to be exer|ci&s;ed in all manner of evil things all Chri&s;tendom over: which is a great &s;hame and di&s;honour to God, Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;tianity, yea, and humanity. Therefore why &s;hould not God's people have liberty to exerci&s;e their good and tender con&s;ciences towards God and man? The my&s;tery of faith, which Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the author and fini&s;her of, is held in a pure con&s;cience; and &s;hould not the work of the true Chri&s;tian magi&s;trate be to encourage the exerci&s;e of this pure con&s;cience towards God and man, and to di&s;|courage the exerci&s;e of this evil &s;eared con&s;cience that di&s;|honours both God and Chri&s;t, and true Chri&s;tianity? If not, how are they a prai&s;e to them that do well, and a terror to evil doers?</P>
<P>Concerning the not putting off our hats to men. Ma|ny under the name of Chri&s;tians, have taken offence at us becau&s;e we could not put off our hats, and bow down to them; which we find no command from Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles for, but rather to the contrary. For Chri&s;t &s;aith, "I receive not honour of men" (mark, he did not receive honour of men): and further, <Q>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and &s;eek not the honour that comes from God only?</Q> Now Chri&s;t de|clares it to be a mark of unbelievers, that &s;eek <Q>honour one of another,</Q> and &s;eek not that <Q>honour that comes from God only;</Q> and is not the putting off the hat, and bowing with it, an honour to men, which they &s;eek one of another, and are offended if they have it not? Do not the very Turks mock at the Chri&s;tians in their proverb, &s;aying, <Q>The Chri&s;tians &s;pend much of their time in put|ting off their hats, and &s;hewing their bare head to one an|other?</Q> Should not tho&s;e be beyond Turks, that bear the noble name of Chri&s;tian, above &s;eeking honour one of an|other, and per&s;ecuting them that will not give it, when all
<PB N="455" REF="037441_0971_100D9513AAF43358">true believing Chri&s;tians &s;hould &s;eek the honour that comes from God only? which is the duty of all true believers in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, for he would not receive honour of men. And <Q>he that believeth on the Son of God, hath ever|la&s;ting life: and he that believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee life, but the wrath of God abideth upon him,</Q> John iii. 36. Is not the Turks proverb a reproach to the Chri&s;|tians, who &s;ay, <Q>That the Chri&s;tians &s;pend much of their time in putting off their hats, and &s;hewing their bare head one to another?</Q> Have you not &s;ined and impri&s;oned ma|ny, becau&s;e they would not put off their hats to you, and &s;hew you their bare heads? In many of your courts they &s;hall not have right and ju&s;tice, nor liberty and free|dom in cities or &s;tates, though they have truly &s;erved their time, and are hone&s;t and civil men, unle&s;s they will put off their hats, and &s;hew you their bare head? Have you not made a law again&s;t &s;uch, that they mu&s;t forfeit two guilders if they do it not? Do not you &s;eek to compel and force them to do it, and fine &s;uch as do not, as at Lan&s;|meer in Waterland? Is not this the honour that you &s;eek one of another? Did not the Phari&s;ees and Jews do the &s;ame?</P>
<P>As for your &s;aying, <Q>The apo&s;tle commands to honour all men; and &s;uch as rule well are worthy of double ho|nour:</Q> If this "honouring all men" were to put off their hats to all men, and &s;hew all men their bare heads, then this command you break your&s;elves, for you do not this to all men generally; and if they that rule well, mu&s;t have double hat-honour, then they mu&s;t put off their hats twice, and &s;hew them their bare heads. If this hat-honour, and &s;hewing the bare head, be an invention of men, and not from God, and ye cannot prove it by &s;cripture, yet &s;ay, "It is your rule,;" then you act be&s;ide the rule, and compel people to act contrary to your rule. For where did ever the prophets, Chri&s;t, or the apo&s;tles command any &s;uch thing? Let us &s;ee a command, a practice, and an example for it. Nebuchadnezzar, who was a per&s;ecu|tor, and ca&s;t the three children of I&s;rael into the fire with their ho&s;e, cloaks, and hats, we do not read that he was offended at them becau&s;e they did not put off their hats, and &s;hew him their bare heads; but becau&s;e they would not bow to his image. And is it not &s;aid in the margin of the bible, where it is &s;aid, "Honour all men", <Q>Have all men in e&s;teem?</Q> Then they that rule well, are wor|thy
<PB N="456" REF="037441_0972_100D95155C1358F0">of double e&s;teem; and this e&s;teem mu&s;t be truly in the heart, without any envy, malice, or hatred. As all men are the workman&s;hip of God, they are to be e&s;teem|ed in the heart with the Spirit of God; and they that rule well, are worthy of double e&s;teem: here is true ho|nour from the heart, both to God and man, his workman|&s;hip. For people may put off their hats and &s;hew their bare heads one to another once, or twice to the officers and magi&s;trates, and yet be full of envy, malice, hatred, and murder in their hearts one again&s;t another; and give them that honour, as you call it, and yet &s;peak or wi&s;h evil towards them, when they have turned their backs off them. The true honour or e&s;teem in the heart to all men, as they are God's creation, is without any evil wi&s;h or thought in the heart to any, and they that rule well have the double e&s;teem, whom God hath placed over people. There is no evil in the heart that gives this re&s;pect, e&s;teem, or honour, and brings them love their neighbours as them&s;elves, and to <Q>do unto all men as they would have them do unto them,</Q> in that they e&s;teem all men, and have a double e&s;teem for them that rule well. This is beyond all the honour of putting off the hats once to all men, and twice to them that are worthy of the double-honour, as you may call it. But we would a&s;k Chri&s;|tians, that practi&s;e this hat-honour, and &s;hewing one ano|ther their bare heads, Who invented this honour, &s;eeing they cannot prove that ever Chri&s;t or the apo&s;tles did com|mand or practi&s;e any &s;uch thing, or Mo&s;es in the time of the law? Do not &s;ay or think that we had this practice of not putting off our hats from the Turk; for we were mov|ed by the Spirit of the Lord, before ever we heard of the Turks proverb and practice, to leave the honour that is below, and &s;eek the honour that comes from above, when we came to be true believers in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Concerning per&s;ecuting, impri&s;oning, and bani&s;hing God's people, in whom Chri&s;t is manife&s;t, and dwells in their hearts, doth not Chri&s;t tell you, that in &s;o doing you impri&s;on him? Then do you not bani&s;h him, and per&s;e|cute him out of your cities and corporations? And how can you enter into and have a &s;hare in his kingdom, though you may profe&s;s him in words? Are not &s;uch to go into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, that do not vi&s;it Chri&s;t in pri&s;on? Then what will become of you, that bani&s;h and impri&s;on him where he is manife&s;t in his members, nor &s;uffer them
<PB N="457" REF="037441_0973_100D95177574EFC0">to meet together to enjoy him among&s;t them, according to his promi&s;e? Therefore you, that will not let Chri&s;t reign in his people, and have his liberty in them in your cities and countries, to exerci&s;e his offices, you will not have your liberty in heaven. You that will not let Chri&s;t reign in your hearts, nor &s;uffer him to reign in his people here upon the earth, in this world, in your kingdoms, you will not reign with Chri&s;t in heaven, in his kingdom, nor in the world without end.</P>
<P>You, that bani&s;h the truth out of your cities or coun|tries, or his people for its &s;ake, you bani&s;h the truth and Chri&s;t out of your hearts from ruling there; &s;o you your|&s;elves are not the temples of God. When you have bani&s;hed Chri&s;t and his truth out of your own hearts, you bani&s;h &s;uch, in whom he rules, out of your e&s;tates and country; then &s;ee what judgments the Lord doth bring upon you, when you are left to your&s;elves; yea, fears and troubles, one judgment after another, comes upon you, till you are even filled with them. But the bani&s;h|ed, the &s;ufferers for truth and Chri&s;t's &s;ake, have a peacea|ble habitation in the truth, which the devil is out of, and cannot get into; which habitation will outla&s;t all the habitations of the wicked and per&s;ecutors, though they be never &s;o full of words without life and truth. The life and the truth will outla&s;t all airy notions; and Chri&s;t the Lamb and his patient Seed, will overcome the devourer with his impatient &s;eed: and they that have the garment, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, which is the fine linen, will find it to outla&s;t all the rags and inventions of men. Chri&s;t &s;aith to his learners, <Q>Be of good cheer I have overcome the world, the per&s;ecuting world.</Q> He al&s;o &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, <Q>Marvel not if that the world hate you, for it hated me before you.</Q> Therefore let all that profe&s;s them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, lay a&s;ide per&s;ecution about religion, churches or wor&s;hip, fa&s;ting or praying days; for you have no command from Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles to per&s;ecute any. Chri&s;t, who is the King of kings, and Lord of lords, when they called him a deceiver, bla&s;phe|med him, and &s;aid, "He had a devil," did not per&s;ecute any of them for it, nor force or compel any to hear and believe him, nor the apo&s;tles after him; but he bad them, that would have been plucking up the tares, <Q>let the tares and the wheat grow together until the harve&s;t.</Q> So
<PB N="458" REF="037441_0974_100D9519DB3F7AA8">you have no command from Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles to per|&s;ecute, impri&s;on, bani&s;h, or &s;poil the goods of any for matter of pure con&s;cience and religion, wor&s;hip, faith, and church in the go&s;pel-times.</P>

<HEAD>A warning to the magi&s;trates, prie&s;ts, and people of the city of Hamburgh, to humble them&s;elves before the Lord, and not to be high-minded.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have painted and garni&s;hed the in&s;ide of your outward hou&s;es and high-places; but look within your hearts with the light of Chri&s;t, which he hath enlight|ened you and every man that cometh into the world with|al, and with it you may &s;ee how foul your hearts and in|&s;ides are with &s;in and evil, which Chri&s;t tells you ye &s;hould make clean; who told the Phari&s;ees how they "painted the &s;epulchres of the righteous," and they them|&s;elves were full of rottenne&s;s and corruption. Therefore look into your&s;elves and your own hearts, what you are full of. To paint the &s;epulchres of the righteous apo&s;tles, and make a trade and a profe&s;&s;ion of their words, without the &s;ame Holy Gho&s;t, power, light, and truth which they were in, will not &s;tand the day of God's vengeance. Therefore repent while you have time, turn to the Lord with your whole hearts, and do not think your&s;elves &s;e|cure without a &s;en&s;e of his immediate almighty protection. For it is not all your works, nor all your own &s;trength, power, and defence that can protect you. It is not for you to look at them, and think your&s;elves &s;ecure, and to &s;it down in your &s;ecurity, and let your hearts be merry, and at re&s;t and ea&s;e. When the Lord brings a &s;courge upon you, that you are filled with terrors and fears, re|member you were warned, that you were &s;et down, but not in the true re&s;t. Then all your own &s;trength and force will &s;tand you in no &s;tead; you will acknowledge that it mu&s;t be God that mu&s;t protect you. Therefore take warning; for your prie&s;ts and people are too high, are &s;wallowed up too much in this world. The vanities
<PB N="459" REF="037441_0975_100D951BE06BE570">of it carry your minds away from God; your care is more for the world than for God, and more after the riches of this world than after the riches of the world that has no end. Know you not that all your heaps of outward trea|&s;ure mu&s;t have an end, and that you mu&s;t leave them all behind you? Therefore I am to warn and advi&s;e you, both high and low, prie&s;ts and people, to come to the grace, light, and truth that comes by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to the manife&s;tation of the good Spirit of God, which is giv|en you to profit withal; that with this grace, truth, light, and Spirit of Chri&s;t, you may turn to him from whence it comes, who &s;aith, "Learn of me;" and God &s;aith, "This is my beloved Son, hear ye him." So all the children of the new covenant, that walk in the new and living way, do hear Chri&s;t their prophet, that God has rai&s;ed up, and anointed to be their teacher and prie&s;t. So now, God doth &s;peak to his people by his Son, as he did in the apo&s;tles days. The Lord is come to teach his people him&s;elf by his grace, light, truth, and Spirit, and to bring them off from all the world's teachers, made by men &s;ince the apo&s;tles days; who have kept people always learning, that they may always be paying of them. And he is come to bring them off all the world's religions, to the religion that he &s;et up in the apo&s;tles days in the new covenant, which is pure and undefiled before God in his &s;ight, and keeps from the &s;pots of the world, &amp;c. And the Lord is come to bring them off all the world's churches, to the church in God, which Chri&s;t the heaven|ly man is head of; and to bring them off all the world's wor&s;hips, to wor&s;hip God in Spirit and in truth, which Chri&s;t &s;et up above &s;ixteen hundred years &s;ince. So all men and women mu&s;t come to the Spirit and truth in their hearts, by which they mu&s;t know the God of truth, who is a Spirit; and then in the Spirit and truth they will wor&s;hip him, and know what and who they wor&s;hip. Al|&s;o the Lord is come to bring his people off all the world's temples, that with the Spirit they may know their bodies to be the temples of the Holy Gho&s;t. And the Lord is come to bring his people off all the world's cro&s;&s;es, pic|tures, images, and likene&s;&s;es; to know that the power of God is the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, which cruci&s;ies them to the world, and brings them up into the likene&s;s and image of God man and woman were in before they fell; and &s;o to
<PB N="460" REF="037441_0976_100D951DB2521868">Chri&s;t that never fell. This work mu&s;t all know in their hearts by the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who <Q>is the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</Q> It is called the light in man and woman, and the life in Chri&s;t the Word; who &s;aith, <Q>Believe in the light, that ye may become children of the light.</Q> And the light lets you &s;ee all your evil actions that you have committed, your ungodly ways you have walked in, and your ungod|ly words and thoughts. If you hate this light, and love the darkne&s;s, and the prince of it, more than this light, which is the life in Chri&s;t, the Prince of life, and will not come to it, becau&s;e your deeds be evil, and it will reprove you, Chri&s;t tells you, "This light is your condemnation." Then what is all your profe&s;&s;ion good for, when you re|main under the condemnation of the true light, in which you &s;hould believe, and &s;o become children of light, and out of condemnation? Therefore every one mu&s;t believe in the light, if they receive Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and to as many as receive him, he gives <Q>power to become the &s;ons of God.</Q> He that hath the Son of God, hath life; they that have not the Son of God, have not life; and if you have not life, what good doth all your profe&s;&s;ion of the &s;criptures from Gene&s;is to Revelations do you, any more than the Jews, Scribes, and Phari&s;ees, that would not re|ceive Chri&s;t the life, upon whom God brought his over|flowing &s;courge. Therefore do you take heed for your &s;trength will be no better than theirs, if you have not God and Chri&s;t's &s;upporting power, when God's &s;courge comes upon you, and you are filled with horrors and fears. My de&s;ires are, that you may all repent, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, and not grieve, nor quench, nor vex, nor re|bel again&s;t God's good Spirit in you, nor <Q>walk de&s;pite|fully again&s;t the Spirit of grace,</Q> nor turn from it unto wantonne&s;s, which would teach you, and bring your &s;al|vation. If you do, how can you e&s;cape the overflowing &s;courge of the Almighty, and the wrath of the Lamb? My de&s;ires are, that you may all obey God's good Spirit of truth, which will lead you out of all evil into all truth, and reprove you for your own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and for your own judgment and &s;in, and bring you to cleave to that which is good, to for&s;ake that which is evil, and to turn to the Lord, who will receive you in his mercy and kindne&s;s; by which means you may e&s;cape the overflowing &s;courge in
<PB N="461" REF="037441_0977_100D952064C7AA28">the day of vengeance, which dreadful day is coming upon all evil-doers.

<P>CHRIST Je&s;us &s;aith, <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are the peace-makers, for they &s;hall be called the children of God,</Q> Matth. v. 9. &s;o all Chri&s;tian men are to for&s;ake evil and do good, to &s;eek peace and follow it, if they will <Q>love life, and &s;ee good days,</Q> 1 Pet. iii. 11. God hath called all true Chri&s;tians unto peace, 1 Cor. vii. therefore all Chri&s;tians ought to follow this peace, which God calls them to. They &s;hould let the peace of God rule in all their hearts; which is above the peace of this world that is &s;o &s;oon broken. For the apo&s;tle commands the Chri&s;tians to let the peace of God rule in their hearts; to which all Chri&s;tians &s;hould be &s;ubject. The practice of this &s;hould be among all that profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity; and this peace is above that which Chri&s;t takes from the earth, Rev. vi. which is the peace of the wicked. The apo&s;tle faith to Chri&s;tians. <Q>Be at peace among your&s;elves.</Q> 1 The&s;&s;. v. All Chri&s;tians &s;hould obey this command, and be at peace among them|&s;elves; not in wars and &s;trife. Further, the apo&s;tle ex|horts Chri&s;tians to <Q>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</Q> So this unity, this bond of peace &s;hould be kept (and not broken) by all that bear that noble name, Chri&s;tian. They &s;hould keep the unity of the Spirit of Chri&s;t in the Bond of the Prince of princes, King of kings, and Lord of lords peace, which is the duty of all true Chri&s;tians. Herein they may honour Chri&s;t, in bringing forth the fruits of peace, which are love and cha|rity. For the apo&s;tle tells you, <Q>The fruits of the good Spirit are love, joy, and peace, long-&s;uffering, gentle|ne&s;s, goodne&s;s,</Q> &amp;c. Gal. v.</P>

The apo&s;tle exhorts Chri&s;tians, <Q>If it be po&s;&s;ible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceable with all men.</Q> This &s;hould be the endeavour of all Chri&s;tians. For it is no honour to Chri&s;t, that Chri&s;tians &s;hould war and de&s;troy one another, that profe&s;s the name of Chri&s;t, who &s;aith, "He came to &s;ave men's lives, not to de&s;troy them." Chri&s;|tians have enemies enough abroad without them, and therefore they &s;hould love one another, as Chri&s;t com|mands, who &s;aith, <Q>By this ye &s;hall be known to be my di&s;ciples, if ye love one another.</Q> Chri&s;tians are com|manded to love enemies, much more one another. And Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>As the Father hath loved me, &s;o I hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> loved you: continue ye in my love,</Q> John xv. 8. <Q>By this &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye love one another,</Q> John xiii. 35. But if Chri&s;tians war and de&s;troy one another, this will make Jews, Turks, Tartars, and Heathens &s;ay, you are not di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. Therefore, as you love God, and Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;tianity, and its peace, all make peace, as far as you have power, among Chri&s;tians, that you may have the ble&s;&s;ing. You read, Chri&s;tians were called the hou&s;ehold of faith, the hou&s;ehold of God, a holy nation, a peculiar people: and they are commanded to be <Q>zealous for good works,</Q> not for bad. Chri&s;tians are al&s;o command|ed not to bite and devour one another, le&s;t they be con|&s;umed one of another.</P>
<P>Is it not a &s;ad thing for Chri&s;tians to be biting and con|&s;uming one another in the fight of the Turks, Tartars, Jews, and heathens, when they &s;hould <Q>love one ano|ther, and do unto all men as they would have men do unto them?</Q> Such devouring work as this will open the mouths of Jews, Turks, Tartars, and heathens to bla&s;|pheme the name of Chri&s;t, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, and cau&s;e them to &s;peak evil of Chri&s;tianity, for them to &s;ee how the unity of the Spirit is broken among &s;uch as profe&s;s Chri&s;t and Chri&s;t's peace. All Chri&s;tians are to mind God and Chri&s;t's teaching, who teach Chri&s;|tians to love one another, yea, enemies; and per&s;uade kings and princes to give liberty to all tender con&s;ciences in matters of religion and wor&s;hip, they living peaceably under every government: &s;o that for the time to come there may be no more impri&s;onment and per&s;ecution among Chri&s;tians for tender con&s;ciences about matters of
<PB N="463" REF="037441_0979_100D95247238F6D0">faith, wor&s;hip, and religion, that the Jews, Turks, Tar|tars, and heathens may not &s;ee how Chri&s;tians are per&s;e|cuting one another for religion. Seeing from Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles Chri&s;tians have no &s;uch command, but, on the contrary, to love one another; and knowing that Chri&s;t &s;aid to &s;uch as would have been plucking up tares, <Q>Let the tares and the wheat grow together till the harve&s;t (which is the end of the world) le&s;t they plucked up the wheat;</Q> and at the end of the world Chri&s;t would &s;end forth his angels, and they &s;hould &s;ever the wheat from the tares. So Chri&s;t tells you, it is the angels work at the end of the world, and not men's work before the harve&s;t at the end of the world. Hath not all this per&s;ecution, bani&s;h|ing, impri&s;oning, and putting to death concerning reli|gion, been the pretence of plucking up tares? and hath not all this been before the harve&s;t, before the end of the world? Have not all the&s;e been actors again&s;t the expre&s;s command of Chri&s;t, the king of heaven? All kings and rulers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, &s;hould obey their Lord and Saviour's command; <Q>Let the tares and the wheat grow together till the harve&s;t;</Q> and the harve&s;t is the end of the world. Al&s;o Chri&s;t told &s;ome of his di&s;ciples, that would have had <Q>fire to come down from heaven, to de&s;troy &s;uch as would not receive him (in their zeal) That they did not know what Spirit they were of:</Q> and rebuked them, &s;aying, <Q>He came not to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them.</Q> Have all &s;uch as have de&s;troyed men's lives concerning religion, and the wor&s;hip of God, known what &s;pirit they have been of? Have th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y not done that they &s;hould not do? That which Chri&s;t forbad, who &s;aith, <Q>Le&s;t ye &s;hould pluck up the wheat with the tares,</Q> and &s;aith, <Q>It is the angels work at the end of the world?</Q> Hath not God &s;hewed unto man what is good, and his duty, To <Q>love mercy, to do ju&s;tly, and to walk humbly with his God?</Q> which man is to mind.</P>
<P>And the apo&s;tle exhorts Chri&s;tians to <Q>follow peace with all men, and holine&s;s, without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord,</Q> Heb. xii. 14. Why &s;hould Chri&s;tians war and &s;trive one with another, &s;eeing they all own in words one King, and Lord and Saviour Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who&s;e command is, that they &s;hould "love one another;" which is a mark that they &s;hall be known by, to be Chri&s;t's
<PB N="464" REF="037441_0980_100D95266AF6CB68">di&s;ciples, as I &s;aid before. And Chri&s;t, who is the King of kings, and Lord of lords, &s;aith, <Q>As I have loved you, &s;o love one another,</Q> John xv. 12. and John xiii. And the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>Chri&s;tians ought to be patient towards all men,</Q> 1 The&s;&s;. v. 14.</P>
<P>From him who is a lover of truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and de&s;ires your temporal and eternal good; and that in the wi&s;dom of God, that is pure, gentle, and peaceable from above, you may be ordered, and order all things God hath committed to you to his glory, and &s;top tho&s;e things among Chri&s;tians, &s;o far as you have power, which di&s;honour God, Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;tianity!</P>
