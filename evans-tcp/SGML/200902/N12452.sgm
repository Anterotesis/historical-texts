<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>AS the affairs of GOVERNMENT and LIBER|TY, are the greate&s;t points of controver&s;y, now in the world, it certainly is of great impor|tance, that our ideas be clear and ju&s;t con|cerning them. Permit me therefore to offer a few thoughts, upon a familiar metaphor, which the holy Gho&s;t has u&s;ed to illu&s;trate their true nature. In Amos, v. 24. he &s;ays, <Q>Let judgment run down as <HI>waters,</HI> and righteou&s;ne&s;s as a <HI>mighty &s;tream.</HI></Q> From whence we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> That judgment and righteou&s;ne&s;s are e&s;&s;ential to free|dom. When we would repre&s;ent any thing as quite free, we &s;ay, it is as free as water. And not only the flow of mercy and grace from God to men, but al&s;o its effects in them, in producing obedience unto him, are often compared thereto in the word of truth&mdash;John, IV. 14. and VII. 38. Titus, 2.11, 12. and 3, 5&mdash;8. This is mo&s;t certain, becau&s;e</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> Freedom is not acting at random, but by rea&s;on and rule. Tho&s;e who walk after their own lu&s;ts, are <HI>clouds without water, carried about of winds;</HI> or <HI>raging waves of the &s;ea, foaming out their own &s;hame;</HI> while the true SONS OF LI|BERTY are like <HI>&s;treams,</HI> which <HI>run down</HI> in a clear and &s;teady channel. David &s;ays, <HI>I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou &s;halt enlarge my heart. I will walk at liberty, for I &s;eek thy precepts.</HI> Streams and rivers mu&s;t have &s;teady chan|nels to run in; but they that <HI>promi&s;e liberty</HI> while they <HI>de&s;pi&s;e government,</HI> are <HI>wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempe&s;t.</HI> 11 Pet. 2.10&mdash;19.</P>
<P><HI>Third.</HI> Though tyranny and licentiou&s;ne&s;s often make a great noi&s;e, yet government and liberty are much &s;tronger than they are. The former, like raging waves, da&s;h them&s;elves again&s;t the rocks, and die upon the &s;hore; or like a tempe&s;t, after making &s;ad wa&s;te and deva&s;tation, their &s;trength is gone, and their force is over. While the latter, like a <HI>mighty &s;tream,</HI> carry all before them, and never re&s;t till they can get through or over all ob&s;tacles, which are put in their way.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="015727_0003_0F99DDFBC0F11AA8"><HI>Fourth.</HI> Streams and rivers are of great u&s;e, and cau&s;e a con|&s;tant flow of refre&s;hment and ble&s;&s;ings wherever they come; &s;o does the exerci&s;e and admini&s;tration of judgment and righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, among all people that enjoy them. Hence,</P>
<P><HI>Fifth.</HI> The command of heaven is, <HI>Let them run down;</HI> put no ob&s;truction in their way. No, rather be in earne&s;t to re|move every thing that hinders their free cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth.</HI> The context plainly &s;hews, that a main ob&s;truction to the&s;e great ble&s;&s;ings, among the people then &s;poken to, was their a&s;&s;uming a power to govern religion, in&s;tead of being go|verned by it. True religion is a voluntary obedience unto God. And the great de&s;ign of all ordinances and acts of wor|&s;hip towards him, is that thereby we may obtain pardon and clean&s;ing, with direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to behave as we ought towards our fellow-men. But in&s;tead of this, tho&s;e people added their own inventions to divine in&s;titutions, and &s;ub&s;tituted their acts of devotion towards God, in the place of a righteous practice towards men; or for a cover to their con|trary conduct: And they would fain have been thought very religious, although they turned <HI>judgment into wormwood, hated him that rebuked in the gate, and abhorred him that &s;poke upright|ly.</HI> The&s;e things were written for our admonition; and all things of that nature, if indulged, will prove as pernicious to us, as they did to the Jews. And &s;ince &s;elf-intere&s;t and &s;elf-flattery have an amazing influence to blind men, concerning their own conduct in the&s;e affairs, great care ought to be taken to guard again&s;t deception therein. And perhaps a clo&s;e attention to two late publications, from the ruling party in this State, may be very &s;erviceable in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Eleven years ago, the epi&s;copal clergy appeared very earne&s;t for having Bi&s;hops e&s;tabli&s;hed in America; which cau&s;ed Dr. Chauncy of Bo&s;ton, to write an an&s;wer the next year, to what Dr. Chandler had publi&s;hed upon that &s;ubject. And as Chandler had declared, that all they wanted, was only to have their church compleatly organized, without the lea&s;t de&s;ign of injuring others, the be&s;t rea&s;on that Chauncy could give, why his reque&s;t ought not to be granted, was this: Says he,</P>
<P><Q>We are, in principle, again&s;t all civil e&s;tabli&s;hments in re|ligion.&mdash;It does not appear to us, that God has entru&s;ted the &s;tate with a right to make religious e&s;tabli&s;hments. If the
<PB N="5" REF="015727_0004_0F99DDFBEB623B50">
&s;tate in England has this delegated authority, mu&s;t it not be owned, that the &s;tate in China, in Turkey, in Spain, has this authority likewi&s;e? What &s;hould make the difference in the eye of true rea&s;on? Hath the &s;tate of England been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by heaven by any peculiar grant, beyond the &s;tate in other countries? If it has let the grant be produced. If it has not, all &s;tates have, in common, the &s;ame authority in e&s;tabli&s;h|ments conformable to their own &s;entiments in religion; what can the con&s;equence be, but infinite damage to the cau&s;e of God and true religion! And &s;uch in fact has been the con&s;equence of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments in all ages, and in all places. Should it be &s;aid, we claim liberty of con&s;cience, and fully enjoy it; and why would we confine this privilege to our &s;elves? Is it not as rea&s;onable, epi&s;copalians &s;hould both claim and enjoy it? It is readily allowed; and we are as willing they &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s and exerci&s;e religious liberty in its full extent, as we de&s;ire to do it our&s;elves. But then, let it be heedfully minded, we claim <HI>no right</HI> to de&s;ire the interpo&s;ition of the <HI>&s;tate</HI> to <HI>e&s;ta|bli&s;h</HI> that mode of wor&s;hip, government, or di&s;cipline, we apprehend is mo&s;t agreeable to the mind of Chri&s;t. We de|de&s;ire no other liberty, than to be left unre&s;trained in the exerci&s;e of our principles, in &s;o far as we are good members of &s;ociety: And we are perfectly willing epi&s;copalians &s;hould enjoy this liberty to the full. If they think Bi&s;hops, in their appropriated &s;en&s;e, were con&s;tituted by Chri&s;t or his apo&s;|tles we object not a word again&s;t their having as many of them as they plea&s;e, if they will be content to have them with au|thority <HI>altogether</HI> derived from Chri&s;t. But they both claim and de&s;ire a great deal more. They want to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by having bi&s;hops upon the footing of a <HI>&s;tate-e&s;tabli&s;hment.</HI> The plain truth is, by the <HI>go&s;pel-charter,</HI> all profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;|tians are ve&s;ted with preci&s;ely the &s;ame rights; nor has one denomination any more a right to the interpo&s;ition of the civil magi&s;trate, in their favour, than another; and where|ever this difference takes place, it is be&s;ide the rule of <HI>&s;crip|ture,</HI> and I may &s;ay al&s;o, the genuine dictates of <HI>uncorrupted rea&s;on.</HI></Q>

And that <HI>partiality</HI> was wholly an arbitrary u&s;urpation of the ruling party, without the lea&s;t warrant for it, in either of our charters; yet the majority of the convention la&s;t winter, voted to incorporate tho&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws with others, into the new con&s;titution of government, which they were framing for us, which, if it had been received by the people, would have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed them in another manner than ever they were before.&mdash; Upon hearing of which, the agent and committee of our Bap|ti&s;t churches met at Bo&s;ton, Feb. 21, and drew up a prote&s;t, and petition to our next A&s;&s;embly again&s;t it; wherein they &s;hew, that tho&s;e laws are contrary to chri&s;tian liberty, exclude Chri&s;t from being the only lawgiver and head of his church, are a breach of public faith, as they tax people where they are not repre&s;ented, and impower the majority to judge for the re&s;t about &s;piritual guides, which naturally cau&s;es <HI>envying and &s;trife,</HI> contrary to the wi&s;dom that is from above, which is <HI>without partiality, and without hypocri&s;y.</HI> And they clo&s;e with &s;aying, <Q>Our earne&s;t prayer is, that your honors may be the happy in&s;truments of promoting &s;uch <HI>impartial peace,</HI> as to fix it as a fundamental principle of our con&s;titution, that religious mini&s;ters &s;hall be &s;upported only by Chri&s;t's authority, and not at all by a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment and &s;ecular force: which impartial liberty has long been claimed and enjoyed by the town of Bo&s;ton.</Q></P>
<P>Great numbers, and of various denominations, &s;ub&s;cribed this addre&s;s to our A&s;&s;embly; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Which would have been pre&s;ented, if the con&s;titution had been received.</NOTE> which alarmed a number of mini&s;ters; and Mr. Phillips Pay&s;on, who preached the Election &s;ermon, at Bo&s;ton, May 27th, commended the con&s;titution that was framed for us la&s;t winter, and &s;ays, "It may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as a high evidence of the abilities of its compilers, and if it &s;hould not be complied with, it is very probable we never &s;hall obtain a better." And he &s;aid to the A&s;&s;embly,</P>
<P>"The importance of religion to civil &s;ociety and government, is great indeed, as it keeps alive the be&s;t &s;en&s;e of moral obliga|tion, a matter of &s;uch exten&s;ive utility, e&s;pecially in re&s;pect to
<PB N="7" REF="015727_0006_0F99DDFD698B5488">
an oath, which is one of the principal in&s;truments of govern|ment. The fear and reverence of God, and the terrors of eternity, are the mo&s;t powerful re&s;traints upon the minds of men. And hence it is of &s;pecial importance in a free govern|ment, the &s;pirit of which being always friendly to the &s;acred rights of con&s;cience, it will hold up the go&s;pel as the great rule of faith and practice. E&s;tabli&s;hed modes and u&s;ages in reli|gion, more e&s;pecially the &s;tated public wor&s;hip of God, &s;o ge|nerally form the principles and manners of a people, that changes, or alterations in the&s;e, e&s;pecially, when nearly con|formed to the &s;pirit and &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, may well be e&s;teemed very dangerous experiments in government. For this and other rea&s;ons, the thoughtful and wi&s;e among us, tru&s;t that our civil fathers, from a regard to go&s;pel wor&s;hip, and the con&s;titution of the&s;e churches, will carefully pre&s;erve them; and at all times, guard again&s;t every innovation, that might tend to over&s;et the public wor&s;hip of God, though &s;uch inno|vations may be urged from the mo&s;t foaming zeal. Per&s;ons of a gloomy, gho&s;tly and my&s;tic ca&s;t, ab&s;orbed in vi&s;ionary &s;cenes, de&s;erve but little notice in matters, either of religion or government. Let the re&s;traints of religion, once be broken down, as they infallibly would be, by leaving the &s;ubject of public wor&s;hip to the humors of the multitude; and we might well defy all human wi&s;dom and power, to &s;upport and pre|&s;erve order and government in the State."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">iii xviii&mdash;xx.</NOTE></P>
<P>Perhaps many may think, that the two authors I have quoted upon religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, are of oppo&s;ite &s;en|timents, if not of different denominations, in religion.&mdash; Could this thought be &s;upported by evidence, it would readi|ly be admitted; rather than to &s;uppo&s;e them guilty, of &s;uch &s;elf-contradiction, as they mo&s;t certainly are. For facts abun|dantly &s;hew, that Dr. Chauncy has exerted him&s;elf, from time to time, to defend the e&s;tabli&s;hment we complain of, much more than Mr. Pay&s;on has done. And to defend it again&s;t the bi&s;hops, the fir&s;t of the&s;e gentleman &s;ays, "It does not appear, to us, that God has entru&s;ted the &s;tate with a right to make re|ligious e&s;tabli&s;hments." The other warns our civil rulers, again&s;t &s;uffering any changes in their "e&s;tabli&s;hed modes and u&s;ages in religion." The fir&s;t declares, that &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>fact,</HI> been of <HI>infinite damage to the cau&s;e of God and true

religion, in all ages, and in all places.</HI> The other &s;ays, "The thoughtful and wi&s;e among us, tru&s;t that our <HI>civil fathers,</HI> from a regard to go&s;pel wor&s;hip, and the <HI>con&s;titution of the&s;e churches,</HI> will carefully <HI>pre&s;erve them;</HI> and at all times, guard again&s;t every innovation, that might tend to <HI>over&s;et</HI> the public <HI>wor&s;hip of God."</HI></P>
<P>The Jews at The&s;&s;alonica, when moved with envy, cried to their rulers, <HI>The&s;e that have turned the world up&s;ide down, are come hither al&s;o.</HI> But for a profe&s;&s;ed mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, to alarm our civil rulers of danger, that the <HI>wor&s;hip of God</HI> would be <HI>over&s;et,</HI> if <HI>they</HI> did not carefully <HI>pre&s;erve the&s;e churches,</HI> is much more &s;urprizing! He &s;ays, "Per&s;ons of a gloomy, gho&s;t|ly and my&s;tic ca&s;t, ab&s;orbed in vi&s;ionary &s;cenes, de&s;erve but little notice in matters, either of religion or government." And indeed I think &s;o too; and to whom can the&s;e epithets belong &s;o properly, as to tho&s;e, who think that the church of Chri&s;t, and the wor&s;hip of God, would be over&s;et, if &s;ecular force was not u&s;ed to &s;upport them? Are &s;uch churches built upon the ROCK, or upon the <HI>&s;and?</HI></P>
<P>This gentleman &s;ays, "The language of ju&s;t complaint, the voice of real grievance, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, may ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from the meer clamor of <HI>&s;elfi&s;h, turbulent</HI> and <HI>di&s;appointed</HI> men.

And &s;ince he warns our rulers again&s;t innovations, I think i my du|ty, plainly to mention &s;ome of them, which his party have been guilty of in our land. The learned tell us, that to innovate, is "to introduce, or practi&s;e new cu&s;toms, opinions, or laws, af|ter a &s;ly, clande&s;tine manner. And let the public judge, whe|ther his party have not done &s;o, in the following in&s;tances; al|though they have doubtle&s;s had many pious men among them.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts company came over to New-England, ten years after Plymouth people had begun the &s;ettlement thereof. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">My hi&s;tory, page xlv, lxii, lxiii.</NOTE> The charter, which con&s;tituted them a civil go|vernment, expre&s;sly limited them, not to make any laws con|trary to the laws of England; and all the freemen, who were

admitted to vote for their rulers, took an oath of allegience to the government, wherein they &s;olemnly engaged to &s;ubmit to, "all &s;uch laws, orders, &s;entences and decrees, as &s;hould be <HI>lawfully</HI> made and publi&s;hed by them." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 61, 518.</NOTE> But when they &s;et out to frame and enforce a new religious e&s;tabli&s;hment, very contrary to that of England, they found that their oath &s;tood in the way of it; therefore they pa&s;&s;ed an act, four years after they came to Bo&s;ton, to ab&s;olve them&s;elves, and all the freemen, from their oath to keep acts <HI>lawfully</HI> made, and framed an|other, of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all &s;uch laws as they called <HI>whole&s;ome.</HI> Was not this an innovation of the wor&s;t kind?</P>

<P N="1">1. Con&s;ider what our civil liberties will be, if the&s;e men can have their wills. I need not inform you that all America are in arms again&s;t being taxed where they are not repre&s;ented:
<PB N="11" REF="015727_0010_0F99DE03B4F56368">
But it is not more certain, that we are not repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h parliament, than it is, that our <HI>civil</HI> rulers are not our repre&s;entatives in <HI>religious</HI> affairs: Yet mini&s;ters have long prevailed with them, to impo&s;e religious taxes, intirely out of their juri&s;diction. And they have now been defied to pre&s;erve order in the &s;tate, if they &s;hould drop that practice. "That magi&s;trates &s;hould thus &s;uffer the&s;e incendiaries, and di&s;turbers of the public peace, might ju&s;tly be wondered at (&s;ays the great Mr. Locke) if it did not appear, that they have been invited by them unto a participation of the &s;poil, and have therefore thought fit to make u&s;e of their coveteou&s;ne&s;s and pride, as a means whereby to increa&s;e their own power."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 353 392.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. How can liberty of con&s;cience be rightly enjoyed, till this iniquity is removed? The word of truth &s;ays, <HI>why is my liberty judged of another man's con&s;cience? Let every man be fully per&s;uaded in his own mind.</HI> But Mr. Pay&s;on &s;ays, "Let the re&s;traints of religion once be broken down, as they INFAL|LIBLY would be, by leaving the &s;ubject of public wor&s;hip to the humours of the multitude, and we might well defy all hu|man wi&s;dom and power to &s;upport and pre&s;erve order in the &s;tate." He tells of humours, but it is well known that no men are influenced more by di&s;tempered humours, than tho&s;e who are fond of arbitrary power. And if he had not been deeply ab&s;orbed thereby in vi&s;ionary &s;cenes, how could he po&s;&s;ibly have delivered this &s;entence as he did, directly in the face of glaring facts which then &s;urrounded him, as well as again&s;t divine truth! By an expre&s;s law of this government, the <HI>multitude</HI> of people in Bo&s;ton, have been <HI>left</HI> intirely free, the&s;e eighty-five years, to choo&s;e what wor&s;hip they would at|tend upon, and not to be compelled to pay a farthing to &s;up|port any that they did not chu&s;e: And there are proofs enough to &s;hew, that this liberty has greatly contributed to the welfare and not the injury of the town. And his great &s;welling word, INFALLIBLY, is as contrary to the holy &s;criptures, as it is to experienced facts. That word &s;ays, <HI>in vain do they wor&s;hip me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. If we have &s;own unto you &s;piritual things, is it a great thing, if we &s;hall reap your carnal things? The Lord hath ordained, that they who preach the go&s;pel, &s;hould live of the go&s;pel. Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth
<PB N="12" REF="015727_0011_0F99DE0516F486A0">
in all good things. Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</HI> And Chri&s;t &s;olemnly forbids the giving of any countenance or &s;up|port to teachers who bring not HIS DOCTRINE; of which each rational &s;oul has an equal right to judge for him&s;elf.&mdash; Mat. xv.&mdash;Rom. xiv. 4.5.&mdash;1 Cor. ix. 1.14. and x. 15.29.&mdash; Gal. i. 8.9. and vi. 6.7.&mdash;2 John, x. 11. But the <HI>command|ments of men</HI> among us, while they have allowed this liberty to Bo&s;ton, have expre&s;sly denied the &s;ame to the country; where they have ordained, that they who preach the go&s;pel, &s;hall live of human laws; which laws are &s;o oppo&s;ite to the&s;e laws of Chri&s;t, that they empower the majority in each town or pari&s;h to judge for the re&s;t; even &s;o, that if the minority were ever &s;o <HI>fully per&s;uaded,</HI> that the pari&s;h mini&s;ter <HI>perverted the go&s;pel,</HI> in&s;tead of teaching it truly, yet the majority might &s;eize the goods, or impri&s;on the per&s;ons, of the minority, to &s;upport that blind guide! And the chief judge of each of our county courts have been required, from year to year, to charge the grand jury upon their oaths, to pro&s;ecute every pari&s;h in the county, that did not &s;ettle &s;uch a mini&s;ter as the court called orthodox. Though, at the &s;ame time, if any church, together with the town or pari&s;h, was ever &s;o unanimous in the choice of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, yet there is an expre&s;s law of this govern|ment that excludes him from being &s;ettled in their con&s;titution, until he has an accademical degree, or an approbation from the majority of the &s;ettled mini&s;ters in that county.</P>
<P>And this con&s;titution has been &s;o far from promoting our public welfare, that if the whole town of Chel&s;ea, where Mr. Pay&s;on lives, was publicly &s;old for the mo&s;t it would fetch, it would go but a little way towards paying the co&s;ts this govern|ment have been put to, only for the &s;itting of their legi&s;lature to form religious &s;ocieties, and to hear and act upon quarrels and di&s;putes of that nature, which they have no right to medle with. And how can ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s ever have their free cour&s;e among us, while men thus a&s;&s;ume power to govern religion, in&s;tead of being governed by it?</P>
<P>I am as &s;en&s;ible of the importance of religion, and of the utility of it to human &s;ociety, as Mr. Pay&s;on is. And I con|cur with him, that the fear and reverence of God, and the ter|rors of eternity, are the mo&s;t powerful re&s;traints upon the minds of men. But I am &s;o far from thinking, with him, that the&s;e re&s;traints would be broken down, if equal religious liberty
<PB N="13" REF="015727_0012_0F99DE0634FBD3D8">
was e&s;tabli&s;hed, that I am very certain we &s;hould heretofore have &s;uffered much more than we have done, if the re&s;traints of religion had not often con&s;trained his party to act contrary to their eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, or to &s;u&s;pend the execution of them. They often declare, that they allow us liberty of con&s;cience, and al&s;o complain of injury, if we recite former and latter acts of their party to prove the contrary. Ju&s;t &s;o has Dr. Chandler done with regard to bi&s;hops; and he declares they had now no de&s;ign of taxing America to them; yet he &s;ays, "Should a general tax be laid upon the country, and thereby a &s;um be rai&s;ed &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e, I believe &s;uch a tax would not amount to more than four pence in one hundred pounds; and this would be no mighty hard&s;hip upon the country. He that could think much of giving the &s;ix thou|&s;andth part of his income to any u&s;e which the legi&s;lature of his country &s;hould a&s;&s;ign, de&s;erves not to be con&s;idered in the light of a good &s;ubject, or member of &s;ociety."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chandler's appeal, p. 107, 108.</NOTE> Put in an|&s;wer hereto, Dr. Chauncey &s;ays "If the country might be taxed four pence in one hundred pounds, it might for the &s;ame rea&s;on, and with as much ju&s;tice, if it was thought the &s;upport of bi&s;hops called for it, be taxed four &s;hillings, or four pounds, and &s;o on." All but tories will allow this to be good rea&s;on|ing; and why is it not as good in a bapti&s;t as in a pre&s;byterian? He goes back 150 years, and tells of the EPISCOPAL YOKE OF BONDAGE, which our forefathers came into this wilder|ne&s;s to avoid, and &s;ays, "Shall it be declared in the face of the world, that this would be <HI>no hard&s;hip</HI> to their po&s;terity, and that they would be neither good &s;ubjects, nor good mem|bers of &s;ociety, if they <HI>thought much</HI> of &s;upporting that POWER which has been, and may again be TERRIBLY OPPRESSIVE!"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chauncey's an&s;wer, p. 193, 194.</NOTE> True, Doctor: There lies the difficulty.

<P>At the annual meeting of the bapti&s;t churches, called The Warren A&s;&s;ociation, at Leice&s;ter, September 8, 1778, the fore|going ob&s;ervations and remarks, drawn up by our beloved agent, were di&s;tinctly read and con&s;idered; and the elders and brethren pre&s;ent, unanimou&s;ly de&s;ired him to publi&s;h the &s;ame, with all convenient &s;peed; e&s;pecially for the rea&s;ons following, viz.

And being favoured with a meet|ing of the bapti&s;t Philadelphia a&s;&s;ociation, they cho&s;e a large committee to a&s;&s;i&s;t us; and a conference was reque&s;ted and obtained, in the evening of October 14, 1774, with the honored delegates to Congre&s;s from this State, before a num|ber of gentlemen; to whom it was declared, that if the coun|try might but have the liberty which Bo&s;ton has long enjoyed, we a&s;ked no more.

<P>MANY talk &s;o plau&s;ible about religious liberty, that our good friends, who have not had &s;en&s;ible experience, of a contrary practice, can hardly believe, that a religious e&s;|tabli&s;hment by human laws, is &s;o evil and dangerous as it really is. This makes a recital of a few plain facts, highly proper at this time, in order to prevent &s;uch evils for the future.</P>
<P>Many of the bapti&s;ts in this State, have long been convinced, that a giving in the annual certificates required by the ruling party, as the condition of our exemption from taxes to their mi|ni&s;ters, contains an implicit acknowledgement of a power a&s;|&s;umed by man, which in reality belongs only to God. And in our appeal to the public, printed in Bo&s;ton five years ago, we have given the particular rea&s;ons, why we cannot in con|&s;cience perform that condition. Yet, only becau&s;e we have refu&s;ed to wrong our con&s;ciences in that re&s;pect, our people, in various places, have been taxed from year to year to poedo-bapti&s;t mini&s;ters. And I am credibly informed, that the towns of Lanca&s;ter and A&s;hby have voted this year, that di&s;|tre&s;s &s;hall be made for &s;uch taxes, upon the bapti&s;ts therein, who refu&s;e a compliance with that condition. And another town has violated religious and civil rights to a much more &s;ur|pri&s;ing degree.</P>
<P>Pepperell, in the county of Middle&s;ex, has had a name for religion and regularity, and for an uncommon zeal in the de|fence of our country, again&s;t foreign invaders. But their at|tachment to their eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment, by human laws, has betrayed them into the following extravagance, viz. Be|cau&s;e Mr. Daniel Davis, who had &s;ome acquaintance with the bapti&s;ts before he removed into that town, reque&s;ted Mr. Samuel Fletcher, of Chelmsford, to come and preach at his hou&s;e, and he, by a letter, had appointed a meeting there on
<PB N="16" REF="015727_0015_0F99DE07E6EB70A0">
March 19, 1778, his letter was broke open as it came into Pep|perel, after a town-meeting, and Mr. Nehemiah Hubbard, their town-clerk, and one of their &s;electmen, was for calling a vote whether he &s;hould preach there or not. And as &s;ome a&s;ked who this preacher was, Mr. Hubbard &s;aid, he is old Timothy Fletcher's &s;on; the fox-hunter's &s;on, &amp;c. Such be|haviour cau&s;ed Dr. Ephraim Lawrence to remind them of what was once &s;aid about <HI>the carpenter's &s;on;</HI> and &s;o prevented a vote upon it; and Mr. Fletcher came and preached according to appointmen. And, at Dr. Lawrence's reque&s;t, he came again and preached at his hou&s;e, on March 27th. But in the time of wor&s;hip, the hou&s;e was a&s;&s;aulted, by many inhabitants of the town, &s;ome of whom were their leading men; and one Temple, a traveller, was &s;ent in to break up the meeting, who &s;pake out repeatedly for that purpo&s;e, till he was turned out of the hou&s;e; and then they went to an adjacent tavern, from whence a &s;currilous letter was wrote to the preacher, which, by advice, he burnt. Soon after another was &s;ent, directed thus: "To Samuel Fletcher, now in Pepperell." Wherein they &s;ay, "We &s;hould be glad that you will not come into town ever again upon &s;uch an errand; and you may rely up|on your being treated with oppo&s;ition and &s;corn. Don't, up|on your peril, come into town again on &s;uch an errand, as it will certainly be oppo&s;ed, as ever &s;uch doctrine is delivered again in Pepperell, as we are united, and de&s;ire no bapti&s;ts in town. This for your intere&s;t. <HI>March</HI> 27, 1778.</P>
<P>"It is acquie&s;ced in by all friends to freedom and united|ne&s;s."</P>
<P>This I copied from the original letter. Other threatnings were given out for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; though Mr. Fletcher was not deterred thereby from preaching again in that town in May. And on June 25, Mr. I&s;aiah Parker, pa&s;tor of the bap|ti&s;t church in Harvard, came with him and preached there. The next morning they met again, when the afore&s;aid Mr. Davis, Mr. Simeon Shattuck, and his wife, and three &s;ingle young per&s;ons, gave a &s;atisfying account of God's dealings with their &s;ouls, in order for bapti&s;m. In the afternoon they met by a river-&s;ide, for preaching and the admini&s;tration of that ordinance, upon lands that three of them were heirs to, which it pre&s;ent is improved by their mother, Mrs. Lydia Wright. After prayer and &s;inging, Mr. Fletcher read a text and began
<PB N="17" REF="015727_0016_0F99DE08AB149080">
his &s;ermon, ju&s;t as Lieut. Col. Henry Woods, Capt. Nathaniel Laken, Cornet Simon Gil&s;on, Lieut. Jonas Varnum, Captain Jeremiah Shattuck, the before-named Mr. Hubbard, and a great number of their followers, came up; &s;ome of whom were armed with clubs and poles, and forbid our friends either to preach or baptize, any where within the limits of Pepperell. &mdash;Upon this breach of the peace, Mrs. Whright &s;pake to tho&s;e di&s;turbers, and ordered them to depart from off her lands; but they refu&s;ed to go. Mr. Parker de&s;ired, that they would act like men, if they would not like Chri&s;tians: and re|minded them, of the liberty of con&s;cience <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, and even the King of Britain <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> mentioned &s;undry &s;criptures to prove the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> for &s;uch liberty: But Cornet Gil&s;on &s;aid, Don't quote &s;cripture here! The&s;e men had newly approved of the con&s;titution of government, which was framed for us la&s;t winter, which, Mr. Parker told them, they had now broken. All this could not &s;ilence their cla|mour; but in open contempt of our religious &s;entiments, &s;ome of them took a dog into the river and plunged him. And further to inrage the populace the odious name Tory, was ca&s;t upon Mr. Davis; and when he attempted to an&s;wer to that &s;lander, Capt. Lakin, (a church member, and one of their committee of &s;afety) &s;aid, Hold your tongue, or I will beat your teeth down your throat!</P>
<P>Hereupon Dr. Lawrence invited our injured friends to his hou&s;e; and in an inclo&s;ure by his door, Mr. Fletcher fini&s;h|ed his &s;ermon, though not without much noi&s;e and di&s;turbance from the oppo&s;ite party And while Mr. Parker was at prayer, after &s;ermon, John Green, junior, and Jo&s;hua Blood, who &s;tood near him, made open di&s;turbance; though Mr. Parker &s;ays, that from a &s;en&s;e of their &s;afety under the divine protection, he ble&s;&s;ed God, that there were none to make them afraid; upon which (as others te&s;tify) one of them &s;aid aloud in prayer time, That is a d&mdash;d lie! After which, &s;ome of tho&s;e officers, with a bowle of liquor, hired Abraham Boynton, and Jeremiah Law|rence, to go into a river that was near, where Boynton dipt Lawrence, and then a&s;ked him if he believed? And upon &s;aying he did not, he plunged him again, if not a third time. An as if all this was not enough, two dogs were carried into the water, in the pre&s;ence of the aforenamed leaders of the town,
<PB N="18" REF="015727_0017_0F99DE09ECC78428">
and as they were put under water, Mr. Hubbard &s;aid aloud. There is one dipt! There is another, &amp;c. with laughter and in&s;ult among the multitude</P>
<P>But le&s;t all this &s;hould not deter our friends from their pur|po&s;e Col. Woods, Capt. Lakin, and Mr. Hubbard, came into Dr. Lawrence's hou&s;e; and when Mr Parker a&s;ked them, whe|ther they would protect the Bapti&s;ts in obeying Chri&s;t, in Bap|ti&s;m? Or whether they would act at the head of their mole&s;|tors? They refu&s;ed a direct an&s;wer; but, calling for Mr. Fletch|er out of another room, they informed the&s;e mini&s;ters, that they appeared there in behalf of the majority of the town of Pepperell, who were again&s;t having any Bapti&s;t preaching or baptizing therein; and therefore they advi&s;ed &s;aid mini&s;ters, immediately to depart out of the town, for their own &s;afety.&mdash; Do you mean, &s;aid Mr. Parker, that our lives will be in dan|ger if we do not thus depart? This que&s;tion they would not an&s;wer, though Mr. Parker told them he &s;hould take that to be their meaning if they did not explain it otherwi&s;e. After other di&s;cour&s;e, Mr. Parker addre&s;&s;ed them in this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> I appeal to your con&s;ciences, in the pre&s;ence of God, be|fore whom we mu&s;t all appear hereafter, whether you have come up again&s;t us in the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples, or in the temper of the per&s;ecuting Jews again&s;t them! To this they made no an&s;wer; but &s;oon left the hou&s;e. Whereupon our friends privately agreed to di&s;per&s;e, and, by different ways to draw together to a di&s;tant place of water; which was effect|ed in &s;uch manner, that tho&s;e &s;ix per&s;ons were decently baptiz|ed, notwith&s;tanding the arrival of &s;ome mockers before it was over: And as they were returning to our friend Shattuck's hou&s;e, they were met by Col. Woods and his followers, who &s;hook their whips over them, and &s;truck &s;ome of the compa|ny. And after their entrance into our &s;aid friend's hou&s;e, ma|ny &s;urrounded it, declaring they would have tho&s;e Bapti&s;t preachers out of town that night. Yet, as they prayed and &s;ang prai&s;es to God, the mob di&s;per&s;ed, and they re&s;ted there quietly; and returned home &s;afely the next day, according to their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A narrative of the&s;e tran&s;actions was &s;aid before our a&s;&s;oci|ation at Leice&s;ter, on the 9th in&s;tant; and upon con&s;ideration thereof, it was judged to be expedient that I &s;hould vi&s;it tho&s;e
<PB N="19" REF="015727_0018_0F99DE0A44E73408">
injured friends, and collect as exact an account as I could of the true &s;tate of the mo&s;t material of tho&s;e facts, and to lay the &s;ame before the public. For though far le&s;s glaring breaches of the peace in &s;uch re&s;pects, have heretofore been puni&s;hed by authority, in the &s;outhern parts of this State; yet we had no certainty that the&s;e would meet with like treatment. For there were not only a principal part of Pepperell concerned therein, but Col. Woods was one of our law-givers la&s;t year, and many others of them are greatly afraid of loo&s;ing their legi&s;lative power over us in religious affairs; which, according to their own principles, depends intirely upon their continuing to be the ma|jority of this State. The author of their election &s;ermon two years ago, &s;ays, "The law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation will always ju&s;|tify oppo&s;ing a cruel and tyrannical impo&s;ition&mdash;except where oppo&s;ition is attended with greater evils than &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which is frequently the ca&s;e, where a few are oppre&s;&s;ed by a large and powerful majority. This (&s;ays he) &s;hews the rea&s;on, why the primitive chri&s;tians did not oppo&s;e the cruel per&s;ecutions, that were inflicted upon them by the heathen magi&s;trates. They were few, compared with the heathen world; and for them to have attempted to re&s;i&s;t their enemies by force, it would, with|out a mirracle, have brought upon them inevitable ruin and de&s;truction." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">WEST's Election &s;ermon, at Bo&s;ton, May 29th, 1776. P. xix.</NOTE> According to which opinion, Chri&s;t would have ordered the u&s;e of force in the fir&s;t erecting of his church in the world, if he had not been &s;o unhappy, as to begin the work at a time, when the heathen idols had a more powerful party than he had. But &s;ince the Bapti&s;ts wor&s;hip a Saviour, who always has had the mo&s;t powerful party; and &s;ince he has taught them that the rea&s;on why he forbid the u&s;e of force in religion, is becau&s;e his kingdom is <HI>not of this world;</HI> they ex|pect, according to his word, to overcome all their accu&s;ers, by the <HI>blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their te&s;timony;</HI> and think it their duty to attend upon the u&s;e of tho&s;e means for that end. Indeed we apprehend that we have the &s;ame right to have our per&s;ons and properties protected by authority, as our neighbour have; but party influence has denied it to us, in many in&s;tances.

at Charle&s;town, gave judgment in their favour; yet the a&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors who taxed them contrary to law, &s;oon had all their expen|ces paid by their town; while the Bapti&s;ts have had neither ex|pences nor damages paid them to this time, as they a&s;&s;ured me this week. Who then can blame us, for appealing to the im|partial public, again&s;t &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>I have been to Pepperel, where I preached twice, and bap|tized two per&s;ons, without mole&s;tation. And from the be&s;t light I could gain, from many witne&s;&s;es, the above &s;tate of facts is not exaggerated in any one circum&s;tance; which is publi&s;hed to prevent the like for the future.</P>
