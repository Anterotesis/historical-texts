<P>LET the fir&s;t Cla&s;s learn the <HI>Engli&s;h Grammar</HI> Rules, and at the &s;ame time let particular Care be taken to improve them in <HI>Orthography.</HI> Perhaps the latter is be&s;t done by <HI>Pairing</HI> the Scholars, two of tho&s;e neare&s;t equal in their Spelling to be put to|gether; let the&s;e &s;trive for Victory, each propound|ing Ten Words every Day to the other to be &s;pelt. He that &s;pells truly mo&s;t of the other's Words, is Victor for that Day; he that is Victor mo&s;t Days in a Month, to obtain a Prize, a pretty neat Book of &s;ome Kind u&s;eful in their future Studies. This Method fixes the Attention of Children extreamly to the Orthography of Words, and makes them good Spellers very early. 'Tis a Shame for a Man to be &s;o ignorant of this little Art, in his own Language, as to be perpetually confounding Words of like Sound and different Significations; the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of which Defect, makes &s;ome Men, otherwi&s;e of good Learning and Under&s;tanding, aver&s;e to Wri|ting even a common Letter.</P>

LET the Pieces read by the Scholars in this Cla&s;s be &s;hort, &s;uch as <HI>Croxall</HI>'s Fables, and little Stories. In giving the Le&s;&s;on, let it be read to them; let the Meaning of the difficult Words in it be explain|ed to them, and let them con it over by them&s;elves before they are called to read to the Ma&s;ter, or U&s;her; who is to take particular Care that they do not read too fa&s;t, and that they duly ob&s;erve the Stops and Pau&s;es. A Vocabulary of the mo&s;t u&s;u|al difficult Words might be formed for their U&s;e, with Explanations; and they might daily get a few of tho&s;e Words and Explanations by Heart, which would a little exerci&s;e their Memories; or at lea&s;t they might write a Number of them in a &s;mall Book for the Purpo&s;e, which would help to fix the Mean|ing of tho&s;e Words in their Minds, and at the &s;ame Time furni&s;h every one with a little Dictionary for his future U&s;e.</P>

<P>SOME &s;hort Pieces, not exceeding the Length of a <HI>Spectator,</HI> to be given this Cla&s;s as Le&s;&s;ons (and &s;ome of the ea&s;ier <HI>Spectators</HI> would be very &s;uitable for the Purpo&s;e.)

Words, and give them that mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Habit, of Reading with Attention.</P>
<P>THE Ma&s;ter then to read the Piece with the pro|per Modulations of Voice, due Empha&s;is, and &s;uit|able Action, where Action is required; and put the Youth on imitating his Manner.</P>
<P>WHERE the Author has us'd an Expre&s;&s;ion not the be&s;t, let it be pointed out; and let his Beauties be particularly remarked to the Youth.</P>
<P>LET the Le&s;&s;ons for Reading be varied, that the Youth may be made acquainted with good Stiles of all Kinds in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e, and the proper Manner of reading each Kind. Sometimes a well-told Story, a Piece of a Sermon, a General's Speech to his Sol|diers, a Speech in a Tragedy, &s;ome Part of a Co|medy, an Ode, a Satyr, a Letter, Blank Ver&s;e, Hudibra&s;tick, Heroic, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But let &s;uch Le&s;&s;ons for Reading be cho&s;en, as contain &s;ome u&s;eful In&s;tructi|on, whereby the Under&s;tandings or Morals of the Youth, may at the &s;ame Time be improv'd.</P>
<P>IT is requir'd that they &s;hould fir&s;t &s;tudy and un|der&s;tand the Le&s;&s;ons, before they are put upon read|ing them properly, to which End each Boy &s;hould have an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dictionary to help him over Diffi|culties. When our Boys read <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to us, we are apt to imagine <HI>they</HI> under&s;tand what <HI>they</HI> read be|cau&s;e <HI>we</HI> do, and becau&s;e 'tis their Mother Tongue. But they often read as Parrots &s;peak, knowing lit|tle or nothing of the Meaning. And it is impo&s;&s;ible a Reader &s;hould give the due Modulation to his Voice, and pronounce properly, unle&s;s his Under&s;tanding goes before his Tongue, and makes him Ma&s;ter of the Sentiment. Accu&s;toming Boys to read aloud what they do not fir&s;t under&s;tand, is the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e even &s;et Tones &s;o common among Readers, which when they have once got a Habit of u&s;ing, they find &s;o difficult to correct: By which Means, among Fifty Readers we &s;carcely find a good One.

<HEAD><HI>The Third</HI> CLASS <HI>to be taught</HI></HEAD>
<P>SPEAKING properly and gracefully, which is near of Kin to good Reading, and naturally follows it in the Studies of Youth. Let the Scholars of this Cla&s;s begin with learning the Elements of Rheto|ric from &s;ome &s;hort Sy&s;tem, &s;o as to be able to give an Account of the mo&s;t u&s;ual Tropes and Figures. Let all their bad Habits of Speaking, all Offences again&s;t good Grammar, all corrupt or foreign Ac|cents, and all improper Phra&s;es, be pointed out to them. Short Speeches from the <HI>Roman</HI> or other Hi&s;tory, or from our <HI>Parliamentary Debates,</HI> might be got by heart, and deliver'd with the proper Action, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Speeches and Scenes in our be&s;t Tragedies and Comedies (avoiding every Thing that could injure the Morals of Youth) might likewi&s;e be got by Rote, and the Boys exercis'd in delivering or acting them; great Care being taken to form their Manner after the true&s;t Models.</P>
<P>FOR their farther Improvement, and a little to vary their Studies, let them now begin to read <HI>Hi|&s;tory,</HI> after having got by Heart a &s;hort Table of the principal Epochas in Chronology. They may begin with <HI>Rollin</HI>'s <HI>Antient and Roman Hi&s;tories,</HI> and pro|ceed at proper Hours as they go thro' the &s;ub&s;e|quent Cla&s;&s;es, with the be&s;t Hi&s;tories of our own Nation and Colonies. Let Emulation be excited a|mong the Boys by giving, Weekly, little Prizes, or other &s;mall Encouragements to tho&s;e who are able
<PB N="5" REF="006668_0006_10293F2D79D081B0">to give the be&s;t Account of what they have read, as to Times, Places, Names of Per&s;ons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This will make them read with Attention, and imprint the Hi&s;tory well in their Memories. In remarking on the Hi&s;tory, the Ma&s;ter will have fine Op|portunities of in&s;tilling In&s;truction of various Kinds, and improving the Morals as well as the Under&s;tand|ings of Youth.</P>
<P>THE Natural and Mechanic Hi&s;tory contain'd in <HI>Spectacle de la Nature,</HI> might al&s;o be begun in this Cla&s;s, and continued thro' the &s;ub&s;equent Cla&s;&s;es by other Books of the &s;ame Kind: For next to the Knowledge of <HI>Duty,</HI> this Kind of Knowledge is cer|tainly the mo&s;t u&s;eful, as well as the mo&s;t entertain|ing. The Merchant may thereby be enabled better to under&s;tand many Commodities in Trade; the Handicraft&s;man to improve his Bu&s;ine&s;s by new In|&s;truments, Mixtures and Materials; and frequently Hints are given of new Manufactures, or new Me|thods of improving Land, that may be &s;et on foot greatly to the Advantage of a Country.</P>

<P>COMPOSITION. Writing one's own Language well, is the next nece&s;&s;ary Accompli&s;hment after good Speaking. 'Tis the Writing-Ma&s;ter's Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to take Care that the Boys make fair Cha|racters, and place them &s;traight and even in the Lines: But to <HI>form their Stile,</HI> and even to take Care that the Stops and Capitals are properly di&s;|po&s;ed, is the Part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ma&s;ter. The Boys &s;hould be put on Writing Letters to each other on any common Occurrences, and on various Subjects, imaginary Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> containing little Stories, Accounts of their late Reading, what Parts of Au|thors plea&s;e them, and why. Letters of Congratu|lation, of Compliment, of Reque&s;t, of Thanks, of
<PB N="6" REF="006668_0007_10293F311B5A3A50">Recommendation, of Admonition, of Con&s;olation, of Expo&s;tulation, Excu&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the&s;e they &s;hould be taught to expre&s;s them&s;elves clearly, conci&s;ely, and naturally, without affected Words, or high|flown Phra&s;es. All their Letters to pa&s;s through the Ma&s;ter's Hand, who is to point out the Faults, ad|vi&s;e the Corrections, and commend what he finds right. Some of the be&s;t Letters publi&s;hed in our own Language, as Sir <HI>William Temple</HI>'s, tho&s;e of <HI>Pope,</HI> and his Friends, and &s;ome others, might be &s;et before the Youth as Models, their Beauties point|ed out and explained by the Ma&s;ter, the Letters them&s;elves tran&s;crib'd by the Scholar.</P>
<P>DR. JOHNSON's <HI>Ethices Elementa,</HI> or fir&s;t Princi|ples of Morality, may now be read by the Scholars, and explain'd by the Ma&s;ter, to lay a &s;olid Founda|tion of Virtue and Piety in their Minds. And as this Cla&s;s continues the Reading of Hi&s;tory, let them now at proper Hours receive &s;ome farther In&s;tructi|ons in Chronology, and in that Part of Geography (from the Mathematical Ma&s;ter) which is nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand the Maps and Globes. They &s;hould al&s;o be acquainted with the modern Names of the Places they find mention'd in antient Writers. The Exerci&s;es of good Reading and proper Speaking &s;till continued at &s;uitable Times.</P>

<P>To Improve the Youth in <HI>Compo&s;ition,</HI> they may now, be&s;ides continuing to write Letters, begin to write little E&s;&s;ays in Pro&s;e; and &s;ometimes in Ver&s;e, not to make them Poets, but for this Rea&s;on, that nothing acquaints a Lad &s;o &s;peedily with Variety of Expre&s;&s;ion, as the Nece&s;&s;ity of finding &s;uch Words and Phra&s;es as will &s;uit with the Mea&s;ure, Sound and Rhime of Ver&s;e, and at the &s;ame Time well expre&s;s the Sentiment.

<PB N="7" REF="006668_0008_10293F3423E69128">under the Ma&s;ter's Eye, who will point out their Faults, and put the Writer on correcting them. Where the Judgment is not ripe enough for form|ing new E&s;&s;ays, let the Sentiments of a <HI>Spectator</HI> be given, and requir'd to be cloath'd in a Scholar's own Words; or the Circum&s;tances of &s;ome good Story, the Scholar to find Expre&s;&s;ion.
