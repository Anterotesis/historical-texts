<P N="1">I. THAT &s;ince Sin Entred into the World and Spiritual Death by it, Man|kind do Naturally Run to the Commit|ing of Evil. Evil is the contrary of Good. Good is that which is agreeable to Mans Primitive Con&s;titution, when he was made after the Image of the Glorious GOD, the Infinite GOOD|NESS. This Good, in our Text is called the Glorifying of GOD as GOD. To Glorify GOD is not to add Splendor &amp; Excellency to Him; for who can add to what is Infinite? But to let the Divine

<P>And This Evil is called Sin; and is Prohibited &amp; Condemned by the Law of Nature, and by the Law written in the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P N="2">II. THIS Evil in its whole Nature, is the wor&s;t Kind of Evil; Tis a very vile and guilty and ruining Evil; Of all Evils, that ever entred into the World, this Sin is the Fir&s;t &amp; the Wor&s;t: <HI>The Wor&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e it is the Cau&s;e of all other Evils; The Flaming Aetna that out of its Dreadful Paunch has Vomited on the World fiery Rivers of Deluging; Tor|menting, and De&s;troying Calamities. <HI>The Worst Evil,</HI> becau&s;e tis the Sting &amp; Poy&s;on that Invenoms all other Evils; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.56.

So that all other Evils are but Pictures of Evil (or as Shadows that follow the Sub&s;tance) in Compari&s;on of This Evil, that alienates Men from the Life of GOD, &amp; from the GOD, in whom Life is bound up. <HI>The Wor&s;t Evil,</HI> becau&s;e tis the Prime, Ab&s;olute, Superlative Ob|ject of the Irreconcileable Hatred of GOD, an Evil the whole Nature where|of is wholly Evil, &amp; can never be made Good; whence it is Emphatically called,

THE EVIL; <HI>[To Poneron,]</HI> and no o|ther Evils but this Evil of Sin will cau&s;e the Almighty to Love a man a whit the le&s;s; and no Executions of Revenge from Heaven are done on any, but becau&s;e of This mo&s;t Abominable &amp; Provoking E|vil. Yea, tis &s;uch an Evil as all the Good that men can do on Earth can't make Reparation of, or Atonement for; and as all the Judgments &amp; Torments on Sinners in Earth &amp; in Hell can't po&s;&s;ibly make any Satisfaction for, or Expiation of. Tis Therefore &s;urely a very Hei|nous Evil; and the Wor&s;t Kind of Evil.</P>
<P N="3">III. FOR Men to Run directly again&s;t Their Light &amp; Knowledge to the Com|mitting of this Evil of Sin, is in it &s;elf a Woful Crime; Which being Added to the Evil that is Committed, doth greatly Increa&s;e &amp; Multiply Guilt, &amp; Debars the Sinner from Excu&s;e. As there are De|grees of Torment in Hell, &amp; 'twill be more Tolerable for <HI>Sodom</HI> than for <HI>Ca|pernaum,</HI> &s;o there are Degrees of Guilt &amp; Heinou&s;ne&s;s in Sins, tho' the Lea&s;t Sin de&s;erves Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment. Tho' all Guilt is extreamly to be Trembled at, yet
<PB N="11" REF="001450_0014_0FB2F3DA30CDB2B8">
e&s;pecially the Guilt of Sins again&s;t Light.</P>
<P>To Demon&s;trate that Sins again&s;t Knowledge are Much Viler and More Heinous than Sins of Unavoidable Ig|norance, and more Inexcu&s;able, We will offer the&s;e Arguments.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> THAT Sin that is Cho&s;en &amp; Loved and Acted, As it is Sin, as it is a Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Gods</HI> Law, &amp; is Preferred be|fore the Will of GOD carries a greater heinou&s;ne&s;s, than that &s;inful Action that is not Acted, <HI>Eo Nomine,</HI> as it is Sinful; becau&s;e the Sinfulne&s;s of it is not known when tis committed; To fight again&s;t GOD and His Law Directly, To con|&s;ider &s;uch a Thing as Forbidden of God, and yet to Chu&s;e it, and therein to pre|fer a mans own wi&s;dom before GOD's Wi&s;dom, and a mans own will and lu&s;t before GOD's Will, &amp; a mans own Self-love before GOD's Love to Him; to do this Deliberately &amp; Re&s;olvedly, is more contrary to the Glorifying of GOD as GOD than to do an ill thing indirectly and indeliberately, and therefore it is the more Heinous; now the Ignorant &s;inner doth this or that, which he reckons
<PB N="12" REF="001450_0015_0FB2F3DCF9A5EB58">
may conduce to his Temporal Wealth, Ea&s;e, or Honour, not knowing that he tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth again&s;t the Lord; But he that &s;ins again&s;t his Light <HI>Knows</HI> that in what he doth, he Tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth and Violateth the Law and Will of GOD, yet being &s;wayed by &s;ome Outward Con&s;iderations which Preponderate with him, he counts it Good, yea Be&s;t for him for the time being to Venture to Tran&s;|gre&s;s; He directly &amp; deliberately chu&s;eth to Act contrary to GOD in tho&s;e mat|ters, Preferring his own wi&s;dom and will to GOD's Wi&s;dom &amp; Will; thus he embraceth Sin, as Sin, con&s;idering it to be forbidden Fruit, which the Igno|rant Sinner doth not; Therefore the Knowing Sinner is far more Guilty than the Other.</P>
<P>Sometimes al&s;o the Vicious Appetite of &s;ome Wretches makes out after &s;ome Things, meerly Becau&s;e GOD has for|bidden them; and if the LORD had not forbidden them, They would not have been De&s;ired at all: But &s;o de&s;|perately to Love Sin, as Sin, is mo&s;t Pro|digiou&s;ly Heinous &amp; Vile. Such have
<PB N="13" REF="001450_0016_0FB2F3E42A99F9B0">
no Plea of Ignorance, and Unwitting Mi&s;take for their EXCUSE, as &s;ome o|thers have, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.8.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> THOSE Sins are more Heinous in the &s;ight of God than others, that have in them a more Powerful Enmity unto GOD, &amp; His Law, &amp; Glory, than others have; Now that &s;ins again&s;t Knowledge have &s;uch a Powerful Enmity is Evident, fora&s;much as the Inlightned Con&s;ciences of men who commit Them, Interrupt them, Conte&s;t again&s;t them, Oppo&s;e them, Condemn them; Terrible Flames of Light &s;tand in their Way; Yet the&s;e Knowing &s;inners Powerfully break thro' all, to Commit &s;in; &s;o &s;trong and great is their Di&s;affection to the Command|ments of God; &s;o mighty is their Enmity to Holine&s;s. Their &s;in therefore is the more heinous. Moreover, GOD prin|cipally looks at the Heart; and the more of the Heart and Will there is in any Sin, the more heinous is it in the &s;ight of GOD: The le&s;s Will the le&s;s Sin; The more Will the more Sin: Now &s;urely there's Abundance of the Heart, Will, &amp; Affections in &s;inning when
<PB N="14" REF="001450_0017_0FB2F3E8349420F8">
the will to &s;in, like a mighty River, ri&s;eth up &amp; breaks over all Banks of Oppo&s;ition; Vanqui&s;heth the Force of Light, Law, &amp; Con&s;cience; and carries all before it. Even thus it is when <HI>Men</HI> &s;in again&s;t <HI>their</HI> Knowledge, and therefore their &s;in is the more heinous. Such men have no Pleas of Meer Infirmity, and Involuntary Weakne&s;s for their EXCUSE.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> THE more Ingratitude there is in any Sins, the more Vile and Heinous they are. Every Benefit is a new Ob|ligation; &s;o that there is a Ba&s;e Perfidi|ou&s;ne&s;s in Ingratitude; To render Evil for Good is Diabolical, Now the Know|ledge of GOD &amp; CHRIST, and Divine Things, &amp; the Knowledge of Duty <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are &s;ingular Favours and Benefits, Rich Talents and Ble&s;&s;ings; Men are greatly beholden to Heaven for 'em; The In|tellectual World and the Souls of Men can no more &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Knowledge, than the Natural &amp; Corporeal World can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the Light of the Sun: Now Knowledge is given to &s;hew men the Strait Way to Life Eternal, and to prevent Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Wherefore it
<PB N="15" REF="001450_0018_0FB2F3EB2FADB810">
is not Good that the Soul be without Knowledge. The mo&s;t Gracious GOD may &s;ay now to Sinners, 'I put the Bright &amp; Flaming <HI>Sword</HI> into the Hands of your <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> to keep you from the Broad Way of Iniquity, that leads to De&s;truction, &amp; I gave you the Pillar of Fire, the Manife&s;tations of My Glories, to guide you into the Strait Path that leads to Eternal Life; and yet you do wickedly Tran&s;gre&s;s; why will you thus Abu&s;e my Kindne&s;s? Your Iniquity is Heinous. You cannot &s;ay, that you had no Means afforded you to Prevent and Reclaim you from &s;in; You have no &s;uch Plea for your EXCUSE.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> THOSE Sins that make a wider &s;eparation from GOD than other &s;ins do, &amp; that Provoke Fiercer Wrath than other &s;ins and give more terrible Stabs to mens Con&s;ciences than other &s;ins do, and make men more Obdurate, &amp; harder to be wrought upon by the Means of Grace than other &s;ins do, &amp; make mens Ca&s;es more De&s;perate, &amp; Irrecoverable than other &s;ins do, &amp; which if followed in mens Cour&s;e, do Evidence them to be

Chri&s;tle&s;s, and Gracele&s;s, more than o|ther &s;ins do, and which will co&s;t a Bit|terer Repentance, if ever men be Reco|vered &amp; Saved, than other &s;ins are like to do, are doubtle&s;s more Heinous than other &s;ins; But &s;ins again&s;t Light and Knowledge are tho&s;e Sins that will &s;o do. Therefore they are more Heinous. Sins of Ignorance have le&s;s of Malignity, &amp; therefore don't Divide mens Souls &s;o much and &s;o far from GOD, as &s;ins of Knowledge. To &s;in without Know|ledge, unwittingly, doth expo&s;e and lay open Sinners to far le&s;s Wrath &amp; Puni&s;h|ment, than to &s;in with Knowledge, and to &s;in again&s;t Knowledge; Le&s;s is De|&s;erved, and le&s;s is Threatned, even fewer Stripes, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.48. GOD hath much more to &s;ay again&s;t men and to Charge men with (and &s;o have their own Con|&s;ciences al&s;o) when their Vice &amp; Lu&s;t are too hard for their Light, and when with open Eyes and open Violence they in an ho&s;tile manner, do break in upon His Declarative Glory, than when in|voluntarily they happen to interfere &amp; ju&s;tle with it in the Dark, <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.5.6,

7, 23. Verily he that is Born of GOD, that is, a New Creature &s;inneth not, &s;o as to hold a Cour&s;e of Known Sins, without Repentance. But has in him a Powerful Principle that holds a Cour&s;e of Watchfulne&s;s &amp; Warfare again&s;t all Known &s;ins, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 5.4, 18. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.13. No man that has the SPIRIT of CHRIST can make a Trade of Known Sins. In this Regard, Known &s;ins are more Hei|nous and Deadly than &s;ins of Ignorance and Infirmity, The Latter not being &s;o Exclu&s;ive of a &s;tate of Grace and Sal|vation as the Former are, if made a Practice. Moreover, By a Cour&s;e of Sinning again&s;t their Knowledge and Con&s;ciences, men harden <HI>their</HI> Hearts exceedingly and are not ea&s;ily to be Re|covered. If their Knowledge &amp; Light have not had Power &s;ufficient to pre|vent and withold them from their Ini|quities, How can we imagine that it &s;hould have Ability to Recover 'em to Repentance! If the more Ignorant <HI>Sin|ners</HI> might have &s;uch <HI>Light,</HI> There were greater hopes of their Recovery by it, than of &s;uch as have forcibly broke thro'
