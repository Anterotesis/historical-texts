<P>THE Publi&s;her makes no apology for the delay of the account of this trial. His object was not to gratify the tran&s;ient curio&s;i|ty of the pre&s;ent day, but to pre&s;ent to his countrymen the faithful record of a tran&s;ac|tion which implicates &s;ome of their mo&s;t ma|terial intere&s;ts. Truth and accuracy were what he chiefly &s;tudied. He wi&s;hes that &s;e|veral of his cotemporaries, who have likewi&s;e exhibited an account of this trial, had been ac|tuated by the &s;ame principles.</P>
<P>He is greatly indebted to &s;everal gentlemen, who liberally furni&s;hed him with notes of the evidence. In particular, he begs leave to ex|pre&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="027633_0004_0FD556251F152B28">
his warme&s;t acknowledgements to Mr. Moffat, the friend of Mr. Muir, who attended him in the court. From the peculiar &s;ituation of the Publi&s;her, it would be improper in him to &s;peak of Mr. Muir him&s;elf. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that at his reque&s;t he took the trouble to look over the notes which were taken of the &s;peech delivered to the Jury, and he has the au|thority of that gentleman, for declaring, that he believes that the account given of that &s;peech, is as accurate as could po&s;&s;ibly be pre&s;ented, of what was, to all, evidently delivered without previous preparation, and entirely regulat|ed by the circum&s;tances which occurred in the cour&s;e of the trial, and which came out in the evidence.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRIAL OF <HI>THOMAS MUIR, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> YOUNGER, OF HUNTERSHILL.</HEAD>
<P>THE Members of the Court of Ju&s;ticiary a&s;&s;embled pre|ci&s;ely at ten o'clock in the forenoon. Mr. Muir, who had obtained his liberation upon bail, &s;oon afterwards ap|peared, and placed him&s;elf at the bar.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's Advocate, for his Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t, was then in the u&s;ual form, called again&s;t the Pannel.

<P><HI>Paine's Works, p.</HI> 13. <Q>Monarchy is ranked in Scrip|ture as one of the &s;ins of the Jews, for which a cur&s;e in re|&s;erve is denounced again&s;t them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 20. <Q>In &s;hort, Monarchy and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion have laid not this or that kingdom only, but the world, in blood and a&s;h|es; it is a form of Government which the Word of God bears te&s;timony again&s;t, and blood will attend it.</Q></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 21. <Q>Why is the Con&s;titution of England &s;ickly, but becau&s;e Monarchy hath poi&s;oned the Republic?&mdash;the Crown hath engro&s;&s;ed the Commons.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In England a King hath little more to do than to make war, and to give away places; which in plain terms is to impoveri&s;h the nation, and &s;et it together by the ears. A pretty bu&s;ine&s;s indeed for a man to be allowed eight hun|dred thou&s;and pounds Sterling a-year for, and wor&s;hipped into the bargain! Of more worth is one hone&s;t man to &s;ociety, and in the &s;ight of God, than all the crowned ruf|fians that ever lived.</Q></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 78 <Q>What are the pre&s;ent governments in Europe but a &s;cene of iniquity and oppre&s;&s;ion! What is that of Eng|land? Do not its own inhabitants &s;ay it is a market where every man has his price, and where corruption is common traffick, at the expence of a deluded people? No wonder then that the French Revolution is traduced.</Q></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 85. <Q>But the <HI>&s;econd</HI> head, that of a nation e&s;tabli&s;hing a particular family with <HI>hereditary powers,</HI> does not pre&s;ent it&s;elf as de&s;poti&s;m, on the fir&s;t reflection; but, if men will permit a &s;econd reflection to take place, and carry that reflection forward but one remove out of their own per|&s;ons to that of their offspring, they will then &s;ee that he|reditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion becomes in its con&s;equences the &s;ame de&s;poti&s;m to others which they reprobate it for them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="027633_0009_0FD5562D9BAAF260"><HI>P.</HI> 36. <Q>It operates to preclude the con&s;ent of the &s;ucceed|ing generation, and the preclu&s;ion of con&s;ent is de&s;poti&s;m.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Part II. p.</HI> 30. <Q>All hereditary government is in its nature tyranny. An heritable crown, or an heritable throne or by whatever fanciful name &s;uch things may be called, have no other &s;ignificant explanation, than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a govern|ment is to inherit the people, as if they were flecks and herds.</Q></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 51. <Q>The act called the Bill of Rights comes here into view. What is it but a bargain which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privileges? You &s;hall have &s;o much, and I &s;hall have the re&s;t; and with re&s;pect to the nation, it &s;aid, for <HI>your &s;hare.</HI> YOU <HI>&s;hall have the right of petitioning.</HI> This being the ca&s;e, the Bill of Rights is more properly a Bill of Wrongs, and of in&s;ult.</Q></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 54. <Q>The attention of the Government of England (for I rather choo&s;e to call it by this name, than the En|gli&s;h Government) appears, &s;ince its political connection with Germany, to have been &s;o completely engro&s;&s;ed and ab&s;orbed by foreign affairs, and the means of rai&s;ing taxes, that it &s;eems to exi&s;t for no other purpo&s;es. Do|me&s;tic concerns are neglected; and with re&s;pect to regu|lar law, there is &s;carcely &s;uch a thing.</Q></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 126. <Q>The time is not very di&s;tant when England will laugh at it&s;elf for &s;ending to Holland, Hanover, Zel, or Brun&s;wick, for men, at the expence of a million a-year, who under&s;tood neither her laws, her language, nor her intere&s;t, and who&s;e capacities would &s;carcely have fitted them for the office of a pari&s;h con&s;table. If government could be tru&s;ted to &s;uch hands, it mu&s;t be &s;ome ea&s;y and &s;imple thing indeed, and materials fit for all purpo&s;es may be found in every town and village in England.</Q></P>
<P>AND the &s;aid Thomas Muir did, &s;ome time in October or November afore&s;aid, within his own or his father's hou&s;e at Hunter&s;hill, in the country of Lanark, or at &s;ome other place to the Public Pro&s;ecutor unknown, wickedly and fe|loniou&s;ly put into the hands of William Muir, weaver in

Kirkintilloch, eleven number of a &s;editious book or pam|phlet, entituled, 'The Patriot', which the &s;aid William Muir carried away with him, and kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; and which book or pamphlet contained among others the follow|ing &s;editious pa&s;&s;ages:</P>
<P><HI>Patriot, No. V. p.</HI> 168, <HI>and</HI> 169. <Q>They have lo&s;t the di&s;tingui&s;hing character between freemen and &s;laves; they have lo&s;t the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of Engli&s;h|men! They have lo&s;t what the mo&s;t tyrannical Kings of England would never force from them! They have, in a great mea&s;ure, lo&s;t what their forefathers &s;pent their blood and trea&s;ure to defend&mdash;the greate&s;t jewel that any people can po&s;&s;e&s;s&mdash;their con&s;titutional and natural liberty&mdash;their birth-right and inheritance derived from God and nature! They have lo&s;t the con&s;titutional means of redre&s;s for all their grievances! What is it indeed they have not lo&s;t by that hated &s;eptennial law, which has fettered down the elective power of the people, like a dog in a manger, who is only &s;uffered to go abroad <HI>once in &s;even years</HI> for an airing!</Q></P>
<P><HI>No. VI. p.</HI> 184, &amp; 185. <Q>Rou&s;e then ye Britons! A|wake from the &s;lumbering &s;tate of apathy in which you have &s;o long &s;uffered your&s;elves ingloriou&s;ly to remain! Open your eyes to the injuries which have been heaped on you; and a&s;&s;ert your right to have them redre&s;&s;ed. Evince to all the world that you are the true de&s;cendants and &s;ons of your once famed glorious ance&s;tors; prove your&s;elves worthy to inherit, in its highe&s;t degree of perfection, that <HI>con&s;titution</HI> which they rai&s;ed by their valour and cemented with their blood:&mdash;Rai&s;e your voice&mdash;the voice of the people&mdash;and &s;ound in the ears of Tyrants, and their abettors, that <HI>you will</HI> be <HI>free,</HI> and you are &s;o: That voice is the noble, the mighty <HI>fiat,</HI> which none can, or dare to, attempt to gain&s;ay.</Q></P>
<P><HI>No. XI. p.</HI> 375. <Q>And what would he (Earl of Chat|ham) have thought, if he had lived to hear people now talk of a happy and glorious con&s;titution, evidently built upon corruption and &s;upported by peculation? And what would he have conjectured, had he &s;een a procla|mation i&s;&s;ued to intimidate and prevent the people from

exerci&s;ing their right of conferring upon, and publi&s;hing their grievances?</Q></P>
<P><HI>No. XII. p.</HI> 414. <Q>But we &s;hould a&s;k, here, what is the difference between a King of England taxing his &s;ubjects without con&s;ent of Parliament, and taxing them with the con&s;ent of Parliament, which Parliament the King, or his Mini&s;ter, can influence as he plea&s;es to approve of war or peace, and to vote &s;uch &s;upplies as may be required; no matter how grievous or burden&s;ome, nor for what ba&s;e or corrupt purpo&s;es they are granted: One would think that the latter method is equally <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive,</HI> and de&s;erving of reprobation; for being done with a &s;eeming legality, and under a form and &s;emblance of <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> procedure, the people are made parties to their own oppre&s;&s;ion, and the greate&s;t in&s;ults are added to the heavie&s;t injuries.</Q></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 419. <Q>Here we &s;ee clearly the origin of the immen&s;e overgrown landed property of our race of nobles and rich commoners; a right founded in murder, de&s;olation, ra|pine, and pro&s;cription of the fir&s;t owners and holders of the landed property in this kingdom, among our Saxon ance&s;tors; and by this we may ea&s;ily trace the means by which our nobility are at this moment not only in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of one branch of the legi&s;lature by hereditary claim, but by which they have al&s;o monopolized, with the addi|tion of a few rich commoners, the <HI>majority of voice in the Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> which, &s;hame to tell, is bare-facedly called the Repre&s;entation of the <HI>People.</HI> This we pledge our&s;elves to prove to the &s;atisfaction of our readers in the cour&s;e of this work, and indeed of a few more numbers?</Q> And the &s;aid paper or publication, entituled, <Q>A Decla|ration of Rights, and Addre&s;s to the People, approved of by a number of the Friends of Reform in Pai&s;ley,</Q> di&s;tri|buted and circulated as afore&s;aid, contained the following pa&s;&s;ages:</P>
<P><HI>Pai&s;ley Declaration, p.</HI> 4. <Q>1. Being &s;ubject to the legi&s;|lation of per&s;ons whom <HI>other men have placed over you,</HI> it is evident you are denied that which is the right of every one, and without which none are <HI>free.</HI> For to be <HI>en&s;laved,</HI> is to have no will of your own in the choice of tho&s;e law-makers, which have power over your <HI>properties,</HI> your <HI>families,</HI> your
<PB N="12" REF="027633_0012_0FD55632DA73A6F8">
<HI>lives,</HI> and <HI>liberties.</HI> Tho&s;e who have no votes for electing repre&s;entatives are not free, as the rights of nature, and the principle of our con&s;titution, require, but are en&s;lav|ed to the repre&s;entatives of tho&s;e who have votes.</Q></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 5. <Q>3. Should you not a&s;&s;ociate in your own cau&s;e, and with one voice? the voice of united millions, demand re|firm in the national repre&s;entation</Q></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 8. <Q>10 But &s;uch a Parliament cannot be had unle&s;s we will revert to the fir&s;t principles of our con&s;titution, which we have &s;o &s;hamefully abandoned. A government where the executive and legi&s;lative power meet in a &s;ingle per|&s;on has no more pretence to freedom; it is perfect de&s;|poti&s;m; and the people who &s;ubmit to it are in a &s;tate of <HI>&s;lavery.</HI> If the will of the Prince <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be <HI>law,</HI> in what manner it is announced, whether the mandate i&s;&s;ue direct|ly from the throne it&s;elf, or through the medium of the Hou&s;e of Commons, is a matter of indifference. If that a&s;&s;embly is no longer the repre&s;entative of the people, the con&s;titution is <HI>changed.</HI> If tho&s;e men who are &s;aid to re|pre&s;ent us are only the <HI>regi&s;ters</HI> of the <HI>Royal edicts,</HI> the government is degenerated into an <HI>ab&s;olute Monarchy.</HI> Since electing a Parliament is our only &s;ecurity again&s;t an <HI>arbitrary</HI> power in the Crown, election it&s;elf mu&s;t be not only the common right, but the common <HI>duty,</HI> of all the people.</Q></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 15. <Q>But the evils of long Parliaments&mdash;are they not writen in <HI>tears</HI> and in <HI>blood?</HI> And have they left us aught of liberty but the name? With the poor exception then, of one year of freedom in <HI>&s;even,</HI> and that in favour of not <HI>one-&s;eventh,</HI> part of the nation, it is demon&s;trated that you are <HI>con&s;tantly taxed without being repre&s;ented and compelled to obey laws to which you never gave a&s;&s;ent.</HI> Are not the&s;e the very definitions of &s;lavery? And, are you not thus degraded to a level with the very <HI>cattle</HI> in the field, and the &s;heep in the fold; which are a property to tho&s;e who rule over them, and <HI>have no power to &s;ay,</HI> why are we bought and fold? why are we yoked and laden with hea|vy burdens? why are we <HI>fleeced</HI> and led to the &s;laughter? Demand then with one voice, friends and countrymen, that &s;hare in making your own laws to which, by the con|&s;titution

We rejoice that you do not con&s;ider your&s;elves as merged and melted down into another coun|try, but that in this great national que&s;tion you are &s;till Scotland.&mdash;Al&s;o,</P>
<P>We will lay open to you our hearts: Our cau&s;e is your cau&s;e. If there is to be a &s;truggle between us, let it be, which nation &s;hall be foremo&s;t in the race of mind. Let this be the noble animo&s;ity kindled between us, who &s;hall fir&s;t attain that free con&s;titution from which both are equi-di&s;tant, Who &s;hall fir&s;t be the &s;aviour of the empire. The &s;en&s;e of both countries, with re&s;pect to the intole|rable abu&s;es of the con&s;titution, has been clearly manife&s;t|ed, and proves that our political &s;ituations are not di&s;&s;i|milar, that our rights and wrongs are the &s;ame.&mdash;Al&s;o,</P>
<P>We will not be the dupes of &s;uch ignoble artifices. We &s;ee this &s;cheme, of &s;trengthening political per&s;ecution and &s;tate inqui&s;ition, by a fre&s;h infu&s;ion of religious fana|tici&s;m. But we will unite, and we will be free. Uni|ver&s;al emancipation, with repre&s;entative legi&s;lature, is the polar principle which guides our Society, and &s;hall guide it, through all the tumult of factions, and fluctua|tions of parties. It is not upon a coalition of Oppo&s;ition with Mini&s;try that we depend, but upon a coalition of Iri&s;hmen with Iri&s;hmen; and in that coalition alone we find an object worthy of reform, and, at the &s;ame time, the &s;trength and &s;inew both to attain and &s;ecure it. It is not upon external circum&s;tances, upon the pledge of man or mini&s;ter, we depend, but upon the internal energy of the Iri&s;h nation.&mdash;We will not buy or borrow liberty from America or from France, but manufacture it for our&s;elves, and work it up with tho&s;e materials which the hearts of Iri&s;hmen furni&s;h them with at home.&mdash;We do not wor&s;hip the Briti&s;h, far le&s;s the Iri&s;h con&s;titution, as &s;ent down from heaven; but we con&s;ider it as human workman&s;hip, which man has made, and man can mend. An unalterable con&s;titution, whatever be its nature, mu&s;t be de&s;poti&s;m. It is not the con&s;titution, but the people,

<P>THE Criminal Libel is fal&s;e and injurious; &s;o far from exciting the people to riot and in&s;urrection, it can ea&s;ily be proved, by a numerous li&s;t of witne&s;&s;es, that, upon every occa&s;ion, the pannel exhorted them to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures mo|derate, legal, peaceable, and con&s;titutional. The charge of di&s;tributing &s;editious publications, and of advi&s;ing the people to read them, is equally fal&s;e and calumnious. The pannel admits, that on the great national que&s;tion, con|cerning an equal repre&s;entation of the People in the Hou&s;e of commons, he exerted every effort to procure in that Hou&s;e, a full, fair, and equal repre&s;entation of the people, as he con&s;idered it to be a mea&s;ure, (and &s;till does,) the mo&s;t &s;alutary for the intere&s;t of his Country. But the pan|nel offers to prove, that as he con&s;idered the information of the People to be the chief thing requi&s;ite to accompli&s;h this great object, he uniformly advi&s;ed them to read every pub|lication, upon either &s;ide, which the important que&s;tion of Parliamentary Reform had occa&s;ioned.</P>

<P>Immediately afterwards the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk, a&s;ked Mr. Muir, if he had any thing further to &s;tate, in &s;upport of the&s;e defences, as in the further cour&s;e of the trial, he would be precluded from adducing any thing extraneous.</P>
<P>Mr. Muir then ro&s;e up and &s;aid, according to the rule of court, I have the evening before this day, communicated to the public pro&s;ecutor the &s;ub&s;tance of my defence in writ|ing. The truth of every word in that defence, I &s;hall &s;trong|ly prove before I leave this bar. I admit that I exerted e|very effort, to procure a more equal repre&s;entation of the People in the Hou&s;e of Commons. If that be a crime, I plead guilty to the charge. I acknowledge that I con&s;ider|ed the cau&s;e of Parliamentary Reform to be e&s;&s;ential to the &s;alvation of my Country: But I deny that I ever advi&s;ed the People to attempt to accompli&s;h that great object, by any means which the con&s;titution did not &s;anction. I grant that I advi&s;ed the people, to read different publications upon both &s;ides, which this great national que&s;tion had ex|cited, and I am not a&s;hamed to a&s;&s;ign my motives. I con|&s;ider the ignorance of the people, on the one hand, to be the &s;ource from which de&s;poti&s;m flows. I con&s;ider, upon the other hand, an ignorant people, impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of grievances, and wi&s;hing to have the&s;e grievances redre&s;&s;ed, to be expo&s;ed to certain mi&s;ery and to complete ruin.

mu&s;t always precede REFORMATION, and who &s;hall DARE to &s;ay that the PEOPLE &s;hould be debarred from INFORMATION, where it concerns them &s;o materi|ally? I am accu&s;ed of &s;edition; and yet, I can prove by thou&s;ands of witne&s;&s;es, that I warned the people of the <HI>danger</HI> of that crime, exhorted them to adopt none but mea|&s;ures which were con&s;titutional, and intreated them, to con|nect <HI>liberty</HI> with knowledge, and both with morality. This is what I can prove. If the&s;e are crimes, I am guilty.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN INGLIS, before being &s;worn, mentioned that he was a &s;ervant of Government; that he under&s;tood Mr. Muir was accu&s;ed of a crime again&s;t Government; and that he did not con&s;ider it as proper, that Mr. Muir &s;hould be tried by a Jury compo&s;ed of &s;ervants of Government; that his mind felt &s;crupulous, laboured under much anxie|ty, and he begged leave to decline being a Juryman. Cap|tain Inglis was informed by the Court, that there was no impropriety in his being a Juryman, although belonging to the &s;ervice of Government.</P>
<P>The Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk, in the u&s;ual form, a&s;ked Mr. Muir, if he had any objections to &s;tate to the fir&s;t five gen|tlemen, who&s;e names he had &s;elected from the li&s;t of a&s;&s;ize.</P>
<P>Mr. MUIR &s;aid: Of the&s;e gentlemen I have no per&s;onal knowledge. Their &s;ituations in life are re&s;pectable, and I believe them to be men of truth, and of honour; yet my &s;ituation and theirs is &s;o peculiar, that I am obliged to ob|ject to them being upon this Jury. The que&s;tion of Par|liamentary Reform has agitated deeply, in proportion to its magnitude, the minds of men in this country; different opinions have been adopted, and different parties have been formed. The&s;e gentlemen belong to an a&s;&s;ociation which a&s;&s;embled in Gold&s;mith's Hall, calling them&s;elves the Friends of the Con&s;titution, united to &s;upport it again&s;t Republicans and Levellers, and expre&s;&s;ing their zeal to &s;up|pre&s;s tumult and &s;edition. I belong to the a&s;&s;ociation of the Friends of the People. Viewing a reform in the re|pre&s;entation of the people as a mea&s;ure the mo&s;t conducive to the &s;tability of the con&s;titution, and to the felicity of the
<PB N="27" REF="027633_0027_0FD5564DDC0D5DB0">
people we united our common exertions, by legal mea&s;ures, to accompli&s;h that object.</P>
<P>To the con&s;titution, in its genuine principles, we have &s;o|lemnly pledged our&s;elves&mdash;Never have we profe&s;&s;ed to be its enemies, yet the a&s;&s;ociation in Gold&s;mith's Hall, by a delibe|rate and public act of their's, have declared, that we were the enemies of the con&s;titution. Equally zealous in our declara|tions to the world&mdash;in our reprobating riot and &s;edition; and &s;incere in our hearts, that a&s;&s;ociation has denounced us to this country, as attempting to kindle the torch of civil war, and to lay it in blood and in de&s;truction. The fact upon which I found this charge is notorious, and cannot be denied. A Convention of Delegates, from all the So|cieties of the Friends of the People in Scotland, a&s;&s;embled in this city, upon the 11th day of December la&s;t. Of this Convention I had the honour of being a member. The con|vention accorded with the a&s;&s;ociation in Gold&s;mith's Hall, in their zeal to &s;upport the con&s;titution, in their abhor|rence of &s;edition, and in their determination to concur with good citizens in their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of riot and of tumult. To te&s;tify then to this a&s;&s;ociation, their principles and their object, the Convention ordered a number of its members to repair to their Hall, and to &s;ub&s;cribe the book which they had opened, of adherence to the con&s;titution. In this num|ber I was included. We did &s;o. And, What were the con|&s;equences? The a&s;&s;ociation erazed our names, and publi&s;h|ed in the papers of the day their proceeding. Was not this an act of public pro&s;cription again&s;t us all? Accu&s;ed this day of &s;edition, of an attempt to overthrow the con&s;titu|tion, &s;hall tho&s;e men be my Jurymen? who have not mere|ly accu&s;ed me, but likewi&s;e judged and condemned me without knowing me, without leaving me the po&s;&s;ibility of the power of vindication. This trial is no trivial matter. It affects me, but it affects the country more. The noi&s;e of it will pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s down to other times, and po&s;terity may fancy their mo&s;t valuable rights connected with its con&s;equences.</P>
<P>A re&s;pectable gentleman of the five to whom I now ob|ject, has felt the delicacy of his &s;ituation, and has honour|ably avowed his &s;cruples. Such &s;entiments, &s;o re&s;pect|ful in them&s;elves, I tru&s;t are common to all his colleagues.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="027633_0028_0FD618E8EAE46090">This is not the only objection I &s;tate to the Gentlemen of Gold&s;mith's Hall being of my Jury. I am accu&s;ed of circulating the works of Mr. Paine. That a&s;&s;ociation has publicly adverti&s;ed their horrors at the doctrines contain|ed in the&s;e books. Nay, more, they have offered a reward of five guineas, to any who will di&s;cover a per&s;on who may have circulated them! If this is not prejudicating my cau&s;e, I demand to know what prejudication is?</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e two objections, I &s;hall make no further ob&s;er|vations. To &s;uppo&s;e them not well founded, would be to in|&s;ult the common &s;en&s;e and the common feelings of mankind.</P>
<P>I demand ju&s;tice. Let me be tried fairly, not by a Jury of the a&s;&s;ociation of Gold&s;mith's Hall, not by a Jury of the A&s;&s;ociation of the Friends of the People, but by men uncon|nected with either, who&s;e minds cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed warped with prejudices. I THEREFORE SOLEMNLY PROTEST, that no per&s;on who is a member of the A&s;&s;ocia|tion in Gold&s;mith's Hall, &s;hould, or can, be of the Jury in my trial.</P>
<P>Solicitor-General BLAIR replied, That he con&s;idered this objection to be of the mo&s;t extraordinary nature. The pannel is accu&s;ed of forming a&s;&s;ociations, contrary to the Con&s;titution, and he pre&s;umes to object to tho&s;e Gentlemen, who formed a&s;&s;ociations in its defence. With equal pro|priety might the pannel object to their Lord&s;hips on the Bench, to be his judges in this trial: their Lord&s;hips had &s;worn to defend their Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Mr. MUIR. This day, I will not de&s;cend into the quib|bles of a Lawyer. I object to the&s;e gentlemen, not becau&s;e they a&s;&s;ociated in defence of the con&s;titution. I too, as well as they, have a&s;&s;ociated in defence of the con&s;titution. But my objection is, that they, by an act of theirs, have publicly accu&s;ed me of being an enemy to the con&s;titution, have al|ready pronounced the &s;entence of condemnation, and have impo&s;ed upon my name the &s;eal of pro&s;cription.</P>
<P>LORD JUSTICE CLERK.&mdash;If the objections of the pannel were relevant, it would extend far indeed; it would go to every per&s;on who had taken the oaths to government. I can &s;ee nothing in the objection, and I am clear for repelling it.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="027633_0029_0FD55651A4485480">LORD HENDERLAND.&mdash;I can &s;ee nothing in the objection; the&s;e gentlemen entered into a &s;ociety for a particular pur|po&s;e, and had the right of judging of the qualification of their members; they did not think Mr. Muir or his friends proper members. In no trial whatever could this be a good objection.</P>
<P>The objection was repelled. Mr. Muir, however, conti|nued to repeat it, as every five were &s;worn.</P>
<P>When the li&s;t of the five la&s;t was pre&s;ented, he &s;aid it was not &s;ufficient to &s;ay that the&s;e gentlemen were free to form a &s;ociety, this is a fact which no man in his &s;ound &s;en&s;es will di&s;pute. But, this &s;ociety when formed, had opened, in a public place, a book for public &s;ub&s;cription. By re|peated adverti&s;ements they had called upon every friend to the con&s;titution, every enemy to &s;edition and tumult, e|very per&s;on inimical to a public divi&s;ion of property by a levelling &s;y&s;tem, to come and &s;ub&s;cribe their names in that book, as expre&s;&s;ive of their attachment to the con&s;titution, to property, and to peace. Every porter, every chairman from the &s;treets, was allowed to in&s;ert his &s;ub&s;cription. Why were the names of the pannel and his friends expun|ged? Was it not a public denunciation of their being the &s;upporters of that &s;y&s;tem of plunder and of di&s;order, which that a&s;&s;ociation was to oppo&s;e?</P>
<P>When the Jury were &s;worn in, Mr. Muir again &s;tated, that he believed them to be men of truth and integrity, but never would cea&s;e recalling to their attention the pe|culiarity of their &s;ituation. They had already determined his fate. They had already judged his cau&s;e; and, as they valued their reputation, their own internal peace, he en|treated&mdash;Here Mr. Muir was interrupted by the Court, who concurred in opinion, that his conduct was ex|ceedingly improper, in taking up their time, as the objec|tion had been repelled!</P>

know him. He did not remember if ever he had &s;een him, but he could clearly prove, by re&s;pectable witne&s;&s;es, that this per&s;on had &s;aid, upon hearing of his arrival in Scot|land, that he would do every thing in his power to have him hanged.</P>
<P>Mr. MUIR was a&s;ked if he could conde&s;cend upon any particular circum&s;tances of malice, which this witne&s;s entertained again&s;t him. He replied that he did not know him, therefore could &s;pecify no circum&s;tances from which the propo&s;ed witne&s;s might have entertained malice again&s;t him; but the fact that he had &s;o expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf was certain and true, and if permitted, he would im|mediately &s;ub&s;tantiate what he had a&s;&s;erted, by the mo&s;t con|vincing proof.</P>
<P>The objection was repelled. The Court ob&s;erved, that witne&s;&s;es might be aver&s;e to bear te&s;timony. That for this purpo&s;e they might make &s;imilar a&s;&s;ertions in order to di&s;|qualify them&s;elves.

<P>Depones, That he was pre&s;ent at a meeting in Kirkin|tilloch, &s;ometime in the month of November la&s;t, but does not remember the day. That the meeting had then no name, but has been &s;ince known by the name of a Reform Meeting. Mr. Muir was pre&s;ent who harangued the meet|ing. As far as he recollect, Mr. Muir addre&s;&s;ed the Pre|&s;ident; &s;tated the di&s;advantages in the Repre&s;entation, &s;ome Boroughs being rotten, others having no vote. He &s;tated the population of England, and Scotland, and mentioned, that from the &s;mallne&s;s of the number who voted, the peo|ple were not fully repre&s;ented. Mr. Muir &s;aid, that if a man paid &pound;. 20,000 for a &s;eat in Parliament, he behoved to derive &s;ome intere&s;t from his &s;eat, and he referred to the people, whether it was rea&s;onable that a man &s;hould pay &s;o much for a &s;eat in Parliament, without deriving &s;ome emo|lument
<PB N="31" REF="027633_0031_0FD618EA837DAD40">
in return. That the Duke of Richmond, had com|plained of this, and had &pound;. 30,000.&mdash;He was &s;ilent.&mdash;That Mr. Muir compared our Con&s;titution with the French, and &s;aid, that beyond a doubt they would be &s;ucce&s;sful. That they were more equally repre&s;ented, and their taxes much le&s;s. That two thirds of the French national debt was already paid. That a manufacturer in this country could not bring his goods to market with the &s;ame advantage as the French Manufacturers; of cour&s;e, we &s;hould lo&s;e our trade. Mr. Muir &s;aid, the Society ought to be acquainted with the principles of tho&s;e members they admitted. That the &s;ole intention of the&s;e Societies, was to procure a more equal and a &s;horter duration of Parliament. That the means the&s;e Societies were to u&s;e, for the&s;e ends, was to petition Parliament, and to communicate their re&s;olutions, and ex|tend their knowledge, by publi&s;hing and circulating u&s;eful publications. That in order to obtain that knowledge, they ought to get <HI>all</HI> political pamphlets from a neighbouring Book&s;eller? but he did not mention any pamphlet in parti|cular.</P>
<P>Upon the interrogatory of the Solicitor-General. De|poned, That nothing was &s;aid about a King, but that the Con&s;titution ought to con&s;i&s;t of King, Lords, and Commons. There was mention made of Paine's Rights of Man, but not by Mr. Muir. One man in the Society, not in a pub|lic manner, but to his neighbour privately, &s;aid, he had read that work. The mo&s;t of the members were young wea|vers, from eighteen to twenty years of age. He knew of no previous meeting at Kirkintilloch, this one being the con&s;tituting one. Mr. Muir did not come into the meeting till after it was con&s;tituted, but had promi&s;ed in the morn|ing to be there. He &s;eemed to be the principal man in that Society, and &s;aid, he belonged to other Societies, of the &s;ame &s;ort: He recommended a timeous accompli&s;hment of the bu&s;ine&s;s, in order, that when the different meetings had communicated with each other, they might lay it before Parliament. At the time he recommended the above mea|&s;ure, &s;ome of the members wi&s;hed to form meetings. Be|ing interrogated by Mr. Muir, he deponed, That Mr. Muir did recommend peace and regularity to the meeting, and

ob&s;erved that any tumult or di&s;order would ruin their com|mon cau&s;e. He told the meeting, that there was no other mode of procuring redre&s;s, but by applying to Parliament, and he recommended to the meeting to be ware of admit|ting immoral characters as members.</P>

<P>Depones, That he remembers a meeting in Kirkintilloch, about the beginning of November la&s;t, which was called the meeting of the Friends of the People, or, for a Parlia|mentary Reform. That Mr. Muir was at this meeting, which was the con&s;tituting meeting&mdash;came in after the meeting began, and made a &s;peech in which he advi&s;ed regularity in their proceedings; and mentioned that they ought to pro|ceed, in a con&s;titutional manner, as the law now is, by King, Lords, and Commons.

<P>LORD ADVOCATE.&mdash;The charge again&s;t the Pannel is &s;e|dition, and it is branched out under various heads.

<P>Then the witne&s;s being examined, depones, That he was pre&s;ent at a meeting in Kirkintilloch, which was called a Society for Reform, on the 3d November la&s;t. He was pre&s;ident that night and &s;at in the Chair. Mr. Muir was there, and made a &s;peech of about a quarter of an hour.
<PB N="37" REF="027633_0037_0FD5565E59ED8AF0">
The general purport of the &s;peech was about &s;hortening the duration of Parliament, and a more equal repre&s;entation. He thought the taxes might be le&s;&s;ened by the&s;e means&punc; That the Reform was not to take effect as to the King and Hou&s;e of Lords, but only of the Commons. He mentioned the &s;ucce&s;s of the French arms, and that liberty would be e&s;tabli&s;hed in France. He &s;poke of books in general, but he does not recollect the name of any being mentioned but Henry's Hi&s;tory of England: in general it was political books. The books this witne&s;s remembers to have &s;een, are the Proceedings of the We&s;tmin&s;ter A&s;&s;ociation, the Pa|triot, and Pai&s;ley Declaration. It had been &s;ugge&s;ted by one Boyd to purcha&s;e Paine, but Mr. Muir &s;hook his head, and &s;aid it was foreign to the purpo&s;e: That the witne&s;s &s;ome time before this &s;poke to Mr. Muir about Paine's book, and a&s;ked it as a favour to get the loan of it, and Mr. Muir bid him &s;earch his great coat pocket, and he would get it, and that he got it accordingly: That this was on the Tue&s;day; eight days before the meeting, at which time Mr. Muir had &s;ent for him to Mr. Wallace's, and told him that he had heard of the intended &s;ociety, and that the witne&s;s was to be a member; and that Mr. Muir and the witne&s;s afterwards talked of &s;ocieties in general: That the witne&s;s took Paine home with him, and read it, and gave it to his &s;i&s;ter: That he gave it to one Scott, and al&s;o to one Stewart, who had &s;ought it &s;everal times, and was angry he had not got it &s;ooner: That Mr. Muir &s;aid, when the witne&s;s fir&s;t a&s;ked the book from him, that he thought it had a tendency to mi&s;lead the people, and that nothing further pa&s;&s;ed in re&s;pect to it; and that he has con|cealed nothing: That he was &s;urpri&s;ed Mr. Muir did not recommend it, becau&s;e every body el&s;e &s;poke well of it, and was &s;urpri&s;ed that Mr. Muir &s;aid it had a bad tenden|cy: That Mr. Muir did not approve of the book, but on the contrary, &s;aid it had a bad tendency: That he knows no particular rea&s;on for his being &s;ent for: That he knows books were bought for the &s;ociety; and that he wrote to Mr. Muir, &s;aying that the books then in circula|tion gave &s;atisfaction: That he received a letter from Mr. Muir, telling that Mr. Provan's cau&s;e had been

<P>The Court ob&s;erved, that neither they, nor the jury could li&s;ten to any evidence but what was given upon oath. The law expre&s;sly required it, and it could not be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and that the Pro&s;ecutor and public ju&s;tice was con|cerned in this matter al&s;o.</P>

What has been called the criminal law of this country, its forms, its pre|cedents, and its principles, are for ever gone. It is vain to &s;ay that the &s;tatute of James VI. allows this proceeding. That &s;tatute is now ob&s;olete. By the law of Scotland it has gone into di&s;uetude. It was enacted under a de&s;potic reign, when the freedom of Scotland was trampled under the foot of power. It oppo&s;es every principle of ju&s;tice; and will you, after the lap&s;e of &s;o many years, de&s;cend into the grave, drag the pe&s;tilential carca&s;e, in order that it may poi&s;on the po|litical atmo&s;phere?&mdash;One word more upon this &s;ubject: The charge again&s;t me is &s;edition. That crime, from its very nature, &s;uppo&s;es, and, in fact, it has often happened, that it may be attended by rapine, and by murder. If, therefore, under the generality, you allow a charge of vi|lifying the Courts of Ju&s;tice, which I never heard of before, you mu&s;t, by the &s;ame parity of rea&s;oning, allow a charge of plunder, equally unheard of, to be adduced as an agrava|tion of the general crime of &s;edition.</P>
<P>This que&s;tion is of little importance to the individual, who is now &s;truggling for the liberties of his country. But the eyes of your children will be fixed upon this trial, and they will tremble and &s;hudder at the precedent. I feel for the country,&mdash;I feel for po&s;terity,&mdash;I will not &s;anction the procedure which is to produce to both, a &s;y&s;tem of inju&s;tice, of ruin, and of murder.</P>

If it had been ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;pecify, in the indictment, all the facts again&s;t the Pannel, that indictment would have covered, by its magnitude, the walls of that Court.</P>
<P>Mr. MUIR.&mdash;This is not the time to entertain your Lord|&s;hips with frothy declamation, with &s;ounding, but unmeaning periods. I pleaded upon ju&s;t principles; every per&s;on here mu&s;t &s;ee their &s;trength, and mu&s;t admit their truth.&mdash;If the&s;e are given up, if the&s;e are violated, PROPERTY, and LIBER|TY, and LIFE are in&s;ecure.

Can there be any thing more plain more ju&s;t, and which requires le&s;s argu|ment than the &s;imple propo&s;ition which I &s;upport? That if you accu&s;e a man of a crime, you mu&s;t tell him what that crime is, in order that he may be able to defend him&s;elf a|gain&s;t the accu&s;ation. Particular acts mu&s;t be &s;pecified, in order that the Pannel may be able to prove, that either the&s;e acts in them&s;elves were innocent, or that he was not acce&s;&s;ary to them. If you de&s;troy this propo&s;ition, if you &s;anction the rever&s;e, what remains to this country, but the melancholy pro&s;pect of ruin and of de&s;pair?</P>
<P>LORD SWINTON was of opinion, that reflecting on Courts of Ju&s;tice was included under the general charge of &s;edition, and that the objection was groundle&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="027633_0045_0FD5566C9B93A588">LORD DUNSINNAN, concurred with Lord Swinton, and declared, that the various circum&s;tances which may come out in evidence need not be &s;pecified.</P>
<P>LORD ABERCROMBY could not entertain the &s;malle&s;t doubt of their being a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;pecifying in the libel, every &s;editious expre&s;&s;ion that might have been u&s;ed.</P>
<P>LORD JUSTICE CLERK was clearly of opinion, that when one crime is charged, another, and a different one cannot be proved under that libel. This none could di&s;pute. But was that the ca&s;e here? The Pannel is accu&s;ed of &s;edition; and will any per&s;on &s;ay, that it is not a circum&s;tance of &s;e|dition for the Pannel to have inflamed the minds of the peo|ple again&s;t Courts of Ju&s;tice, &s;o important, and &s;o material a branch of the Con&s;titution. Under the Statute of King James wherever art and part is libelled, the Pro&s;ecutor can prove every fact and circum&s;tance, and no objection of generality is admitted.</P>
<P>The objection was over-ruled. The witne&s;s was called back, who deponed: That &s;he had heard Mr. Muir &s;ay, that a monarchical government would be the be&s;t in this country, under proper re&s;trictions; but that republican go|vernments were the be&s;t: That &s;he has been &s;ent by Mr. Muir to an organi&s;t in the &s;treets of Gla&s;gow, and de&s;ired him to play <HI>ca ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Muir was a&s;ked, if he had any que&s;tions to put to this witne&s;s. He replied; I di&s;dain to put a que&s;tion to a witne&s;s of this de&s;cription. The witne&s;s turned round to Mr. Muir, and &s;aid &s;he wi&s;hed to a&s;k him one que&s;tion. This the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk would nor permit, as he would &s;uffer no altercation of that kind. The Court expre&s;&s;ed their &s;tronge&s;t di&s;approbation of the terms which Mr. Muir had u&s;ed; and Lord Henderland &s;aid, that if Mr. Muir had been acting as a coun&s;el at the bar, in&s;tead of being in that &s;ituation, he would immediately have &s;ent him to pri&s;on for it! The conduct and the accuracy of this witne&s;s, was much applauded by the Court.</P>
<P>As the witne&s;s was withdrawing, a Juryman called her back, and a&s;ked her, if &s;he had had any quarrel in Mr. Muir's father's family, to which &s;he replied, that &s;o far from that, her mi&s;tre&s;s had given her 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> more than her wages, which

By the law of Scotland all witne&s;&s;es mu&s;t be examined apart from each other. The law is jea|lous of their conver&s;ation: The law dreads their collu&s;ion, in framing together a con&s;i&s;tent &s;tory.

<P>It is my duty, now, to require your mo&s;t attentive and deliberate con&s;ideration of what you have heard. The mo|ment is come, when the truth or fal&s;hood of what is laid to the charge of the Pannel at the bar, is to be a&s;certained. He is a man, who, under the pretext of a reform, as I &s;hall afterwards &s;hew you, has been &s;owing mi&s;chief and &s;edition: he appears here before you, after being a fugitive from his country; and it is now that by your verdict, a verdict which is uncontroulable, and from which there is no ap|peal, his guilt mu&s;t be e&s;tabli&s;hed, or the imputation thrown out again&s;t him, completely wiped away. It is a moment which I have long wi&s;hed to &s;ee; for during the circum&s;tances which occurred la&s;t winter, among the numerous li&s;t of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffenders who appeared, this is the man who of them all appeared to me the mo&s;t criminal, and whom I mo&s;t wi&s;hed to lay hold of, he in every thing betrays a mo&s;t decided
<PB N="61" REF="027633_0061_0FD61906F3E268E0">
&s;pirit again&s;t the Con&s;titution, and all under the veil of Parliamentary Reform.</P>
<P>This country has &s;een many in&s;tances of pernicious ef|fects of &s;editious writings and conduct, but I am per&s;uaded a wider range of diabolical mi&s;chief will appear in this man, than ever was &s;een in England, or any where el&s;e.&mdash;Who could believe that a man of a liberal education, an Advocate at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his bar&punc; could be found among villagers, and manufac|tures, poor and ignorant, for the purpo&s;e of &s;owing &s;edition and di&s;content?</P>
<P>The charges again&s;t the Pannel are divided into three heads, all centering however, in the general charge of ex|citing &s;edition and di&s;content, by various &s;teps of conduct. He has circulated Paine's works, a book which one of his witne&s;&s;e &s;ays he declared to be dangerous to weak minds, with an ob&s;tinacy and pertinacity, which plainly indicated that his wi&s;h was to alter or overturn the Con&s;titution. He went to Kirkintilloch and Camp&s;ie, carrying Mr. Paine with him, and advi&s;ed the con&s;tituting of meetings, which, without him, would never have been e&s;tabli&s;hed; he came like the daemon of &s;edition recommending that club govern|ment, which has produced all the anarchy we &s;ee in France, and which cannot be &s;upported in any well e&s;tabli&s;hed go|vernment.</P>
<P>He has been in a convention of people, calling them&s;elves Reformers; but the &s;pirit of the people &s;hewed it&s;elf, and it no longer exi&s;ts: he in that meeting endeavoured to &s;upport and defend a paper coming from our &s;i&s;ter kingdom: It came from the Society of United Iri&s;hmen, highly &s;editious, if not trea&s;onable; and yet he was the ringleader to produce, to read, and approve.</P>
<P>The&s;e three charges, then, Gentlemen, which unite them|&s;elves in one, that of exciting di&s;content again&s;t Govern|ment, have been brought with deliberation; and, it is now my duty to &s;hew you, have been e&s;tabl&s;hed by the evi|dence.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to have the opinion of a re&s;pectable Jury on the &s;ubject. Whether &s;edition is a crime of the dete&s;table na|ture I repre&s;ent it? I bring forward the arm of Ju&s;tice to
<PB N="62" REF="027633_0062_0FD619089458FC00">
&s;uppre&s;s it; and it is in your power to invigorate it, or pal&s;y it in a moment.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, as the charges are threefold, the evidence mu&s;t be of three kinds. I &s;hall &s;peak of each in their order, and I mu&s;t &s;ay, that if ever a &s;trong body of evidence ap|peared in a difficult ca&s;e, it is to be &s;een here.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t charge is, making &s;editious &s;peeches and ha|rangues, and encouraging improper meetings. To &s;upport this, we find that he went to Kirkintilloch and Camp&s;ie, and recommended improper publications to enlighten their minds; but in this he does not appear to have been very &s;ucce&s;sful, if we take the Vice Pre&s;ident as an example of their in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uence. The evidence here re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s chiefly on <HI>John|&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Freeland,</HI> particularly <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> and we &s;hould re|main the mode in which he gave his evidence; he was calm, accurate, and clear. <HI>He</HI> and <HI>Freeland</HI> agree that the Pan|nel &s;poke of the &s;ucce&s;s of the French a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ms: With what motive could he di&s;cour&s;e on &s;uch a &s;ubject to weak, unin|formed, illiterate people, but to fulfil his &s;editious inten|tions? He talked of the weight of taxes Gentlemen, we may &s;ee the&s;e burdens lightened; but if this gentleman's mode of doing it were to go on, what &s;ort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f relief we &s;hould have by the diminution of our taxes and the pay|ment of our debt, are topics of which you will judge as you ought to do. He &s;aid that their taxes would be le&s;s, if they were more equally repre&s;ented, and that from the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of France, they could not bring their goods to market &s;o cheap as Frenchmen. What could po&s;&s;ibly be more calculated to produce di&s;content and &s;edition? Had &s;uch &s;ocieties previou&s;ly exi&s;ted, the ca&s;e would have been different; but he appears as the ringleader, he was there on the Tue&s;day preceding, conver&s;ing about it; he came to the meeting and harangued them; he adjourned with them afterwards to Wallace's: Can any evidence be more connected or more clear that he was the main in&s;trument?</P>
<P>The &s;econd charge is the circulating &s;editious books, con|taining the pa&s;&s;ages libelled in the indictment, which you may read. <HI>Freeland</HI> is again an evidence here; and I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that it appears to be doubtful, whether he told all he knew; from his face he plainly prevaricated; and,
<PB N="63" REF="027633_0063_0FD5568E03B1EC40">
when clo&s;ely que&s;tioned, the &s;weat broke upon it. He told you the &s;tory of getting Paine's book out of Muir's poc|ket. I may here ob&s;erve, that &s;uch a mode of circulating a book is that which a man in his &s;ituation will naturally adopt; he will not go on openly, but privately, and under various pretexts; by his fruits mu&s;t you know him; you mu&s;t compare his actions with his profe&s;&s;ions, and then judge.</P>
<P>We have evidence of his recommending and buying the Pai&s;ley Declaration and other books, which go to prove he is tainted from head to foot, and is as unworthy to live un|der the protection of the law as the meane&s;t felon.</P>
<P>You would ob&s;erve his conduct, Gentlemen, on Anne Fi&s;her leaving the foot of the table. What can be laid to her charge? her evidence was clear and correct, and was founded on the be&s;t ba&s;is, her's being confirmed by the te|&s;timony of others. But what was his conduct? the only thing, indeed, which he could do,&mdash;an endeavour to &s;hake her te&s;timony by an illiberal and unfounded in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">uation, that we procured our information only from dome&s;tics.</P>
<P>To what then amounts her te&s;timony, which &s;tands be|yond a doubt: That &s;he was &s;ent repeatedly from her ma&s;|ter's hou&s;e, the Pannel's father, who I under&s;tand is a re|&s;pectable man; far be it from me to attach any criminality to him; the Pannel ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mi&s;erable reflection that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which have embittered the lives of his parents have been brought on by him&s;elf;&mdash;that &s;he was &s;ent re|peatedly to buy Paine and other works for country people that came to the &s;hop, who by this man's per&s;ua&s;ion mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> out with their mi&s;erable &s;ixpence to purcha&s;e <HI>Paine's Rights of Man;</HI> that he u&s;ed con&s;tantly to be reading &s;editious publications in the back &s;hop.&mdash;It was there, in that cathe|dral of &s;edition, he &s;at like a &s;pider, weaving his filthy web to catch the unwary.</P>
<P>The witne&s;s &s;pecifies the people to whom he procured Paine's book&mdash;his own uncle, John Muir the hatter, Bar|clay the elder, and, Wil&s;on the barber. I have produced all of them in &s;upport of the girl, except the uncle, whom I declined making an evidence again&s;t his nephew. He ad|vi&s;ed Wil&s;on, who completely &s;upported the girl in this,

to keep a copy in his &s;hop to enlighten his cu&s;tomers minds; for that it confuted Burke entirely,&mdash;Mr. Burke, a man who&s;e wonderful talents and genius have lately been &s;o much exerted in the &s;ervice of his country.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances I have only to de&s;ire you to look at Paine's book, at the pa&s;&s;ages in the indictment; and if you are loyal to your king, if you are loyal to your country, and would pre&s;erve it, you will find this man guilty, who has given &s;o decided an opinion in favour of that wretched outca&s;t. His works I never read till my of|ficial duty compelled me to it; I need not give my opinion of it; the determinations of courts of law, and the unani|mous opinion of the country, have marked the dete&s;tation in which they are held.</P>
<P>[His Lord&s;hip here read &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ages in the in|dictment.]</P>
<P>What avails then, Gentlemen, all this evidence of at|tachment to the king and con&s;titution, when he unequivo|cally approves &s;entiments &s;uch as the&s;e? We are told, in|deed, by one of his witne&s;&s;es, that he advi&s;ed him not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell Paine; but unfortunately the an&s;wer given to the que&s;|tion put to him upon his cro&s;s examination, proves that they were not his real &s;entiments, but for fear of danger, as the book began to be taken notice of.</P>
<P>We find from the evidence of the girl Fi&s;her, that the very organi&s;t could not pa&s;s the hou&s;e of this oracle of mi&s;|chief, without being de&s;ired to play <HI>&ccedil;a ira.</HI></P>
<P>He u&s;ed to &s;ay, too, that if every man had a vote, he would be member for Calder, and members would have thirty or forty &s;hillings a-day. All the&s;e circum&s;tances go to prove inconte&s;tibly, that France and French principles were continually in his view, and that he aimed at the de|&s;truction of the pre&s;ent government; with re&s;pect to which, however, I hope his prophecies will be as fal&s;e, as they have already been, in regard to the &s;ucce&s;s of the French.</P>
<P>I may here remark, that the evidence of Fi&s;her appears in a trifling in&s;tance to be contradicted by the elder Bar|clay; but you &s;hould remember the &s;alvo with which that old gentleman cho&s;e to premi&s;e his evidence.</P>
<P>I come now to the third charge, which relates to Mr.
<PB N="65" REF="027633_0065_0FD55690CFEB2A30">
Muir's conduct in the Convention. It is here inconte&s;ti|bly proved, that he read, approved, and defended, the Iri&s;h Addre&s;s. Will you approve this paper? Will you di&s;re|gard this convincing proof of his guilt? Be his &s;tudies ever &s;o great, be his views ever &s;o expen&s;ive, will you permit him arrogantly to &s;et up his &s;editious opinions in oppo&s;ition to the government and con&s;titution? His conduct in &s;ome in|&s;tances would almo&s;t appear to be marked with in&s;anity, were we not finding him the determined ringleader in an uniform &s;cheme of &s;edition.</P>
<P>This, Gentlemen, fini&s;hes my remarks upon the evi|dence; upon the evidence which I think is invincible; but there are two topics on which I mu&s;t beg to make &s;ome ob|&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Mr. Muir told us, that he was carried out of this coun|try by bu&s;ine&s;s of importance, and that he was detained in France; and that he always wi&s;hed to have a trial, I could have no objections to his proving this: It would have ar|gued &s;ome degree of honour. But his profe&s;&s;ions are fal&s;e and confuted. He left this country under an impre&s;&s;ion of guilt; and lately returned, the pe&s;t of Scotland, with the &s;ame intention as before.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of his going to France, it &s;eems, was the in|fluence he might po&s;&s;ibly have in &s;aving the life of the King of France; and he was &s;ent there by the Friends of the People. Never was I more a&s;toni&s;hed than at the impu|dence of this evidence. Did Skirving know or recollect, that he was almo&s;t accu&s;ing him of high trea&s;on? But why was he intere&s;ted in this event? It was an event, as his witne&s;&s;es tell you, that would hurt the common cau&s;e.&mdash;What cau&s;e? their intention of effecting a change in the government of this country: There then he &s;tands a mi&s;|&s;ionary from a &s;ociety in this country to France,&mdash;a circum|&s;tance which greatly confirms his guilt.</P>
<P>When the trial was coming on, I po&s;tponed it longer than I ought to have done, to give him every chance; and I in&s;erted it in the papers, which might perhaps reach him roaming in &s;ome part of the world.</P>
<P>The &s;hipma&s;ter's receipt bears date the 16th May. What became of him from this date to the 31&s;t July when he was
<PB N="66" REF="027633_0066_0FD6190C12A94860">
apprehended. He informed nobody of his coming home. How wonderful that no letter was driven by the winds or impelled by the waves, to give notice of what he &s;ays was his earne&s;t wi&s;h. The rever&s;e in fact appears to have been the ca&s;e. By the letter of J. Muir, his father, we find him in Ireland, doing we know not what; except what we learn from the diploma of the worthy &s;ociety of United Iri&s;hmen. He is at la&s;t apprehended returning into this country, with all the in&s;ignia of &s;edition about him.</P>
<P>I have but one remark more. You may in &s;ome degree judge of a man, by the company he keeps: among&s;t Muir's papers we find a letter here in my hand addre&s;&s;ed to the Rev. <HI>Fi&s;che Palmer,</HI> a man who is indicted to &s;tand trial at Perth, in the cour&s;e of a few days, and whom mo&s;t of you mu&s;t know. The impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;eal too is worth re|marking, a <HI>cap of li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rty on a &s;pear,</HI> and under is the mot|to <HI>&ccedil;a ira.</HI> I beg your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ention, Gentlemen, to the quo|tation I &s;hall now read from a celebrated French author, in treating of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution. [The pa&s;&s;age his Lord|&s;hip read, was from <HI>De Lolme,</HI> on the Con&s;titution of Eng|land, from the middle of p. 534, to the end.]</P>
<P>I hope, Gentlemen, this ca&s;e will be viewed by you in a light &s;uch as this, that you will protect your King from the attacks of his enemies, that you will protect this tem|ple of freedom from the attempts of the factious, but par|ticularly again&s;t that man at the bar, who has been &s;owing &s;edition with &s;o liberal a hand. You now, however, may &s;eize him in his career, and by your verdict do ju&s;tice to your country, and honour to your&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Lord Advocate here fini&s;hed his addre&s;s to the Jury, &mdash;He &s;poke two hours and ten minutes. We are &s;orry, that our pre&s;ent &s;ituation has precluded us from &s;tating his Lord&s;hip's &s;peech at full length, but the foregoing embraces the mo&s;t material parts, and corre&s;ponds exactly with what we have already &s;een publi&s;hed, and announced to be <Q>a comprehen&s;ive, and in many parts a literal ab&s;tract of the mo&s;t material parts of his Lord&s;hip's &s;peech.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ri&s;e, in my own defence.&mdash;All that malice could devi&s;e; all that &s;lander could circulate; has been directed again&s;t me. I &s;peak with joy, and with triumph. After an inve|&s;tigation into my public tran&s;actions, and into my private conduct, the mo&s;t minute and the mo&s;t unexampled, which ever occurred in this country; my <HI>moral character</HI> &s;tands &s;ecure and unimpeached. With the anonymous, the worth|le&s;s, and the paid a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of public reputation, I di&s;dained to enter the li&s;ts. To this <HI>day</HI> I looked forward with ex|pectation; when before you, in the pre&s;ence of Scotland, I &s;hould not merely remove the &s;u&s;picion of guilt, but &s;hould demon&s;trate my innocency. I will not imitate the example of the Public Pro&s;ecutor, who has fini&s;hed his pleading. Sounding, and un&s;ub&s;tantial declamation is un&s;uitable for you, and it is unworthy of me. This is not an hour to temporize. The eyes of this country are fixed upon us both. The records of this trial will pa&s;s down to po&s;teri|ty. When our a&s;hes &s;hall be &s;cattered by the winds of hea|ven, the impartial voice of future times will rejudge your verdict. Let faction rage;&mdash;let the &s;pirit of party, in the pre&s;ent hour, proudly domineer.&mdash;The illu&s;ion will &s;oon vani&s;h away. In &s;olitude the power of recollection will a&s;|&s;ume its influence; and then, it will be material to you, whether or not you have acted uprightly, or &s;inned again&s;t your own eternal con&s;cience, in my acquittal, or in my con|demnation!</P>
<P>Before I enter into a particular vindication of my&s;elf, let me take notice of two circum&s;tances, &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted upon by the Public Pro&s;ecutor, which have little relation to the general nature of the evidence which has been adduced.&mdash;Long, indeed, has he harangued upon them; and has con|cluded his &s;peech by exhibiting them in every &s;hape which his imagination could invent. He maintains, that a con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of guilt obliged me to leave this country after an information had been filed again&s;t me, and after I had been examined by a magi&s;trate. I will admit the fact of my de|parture.&mdash;In the&s;e days&mdash;in the&s;e circum&s;tances&mdash;is that to be a&s;cribed to con&s;cious guilt alone? If the whole &s;trength of arbitrary power is extended again&s;t an Individual, is
<PB N="68" REF="027633_0068_0FD5569600E92F50">
there merit in expo&s;ing him&s;elf as a &s;acrafice which cannot be u&s;eful to the country, and which may only pre&s;ent po|&s;terity with a new addition to the immen&s;e catalogue of the victims of de&s;poti&s;m.&mdash;If two motives had only exi&s;ted to which you could a&s;&s;ign my departure, you are bound to a&s;|cribe it to the mo&s;t charitable. But what were the circum|&s;tances attending my departure? Did they bear any re&s;em|blance of a flight? Did I not publicly anounce it the prece|ding evening in a numerous meeting of citizens? Did I not cau&s;e it to be publi&s;hed in a public paper? Did I affect the garb and di&s;gui&s;e of concealment? In London did I re|main in ob&s;curity? Did I not appear in a di&s;tingui&s;hed So|ciety, the Society of the Friends of the People? And did not that Society publi&s;h afterwards a re&s;olution, announcing in its preamble my pre&s;ence among them?</P>
<P>But I went immediately afterwards to France. Mr. Skirving, who was examined with regard to a letter he re|ceived from me, before my departure from London, has &s;aid, in his evidence (and his words I have accurately in my notes,) that I propo&s;ed to go to Paris, as it was the advice <HI>OF SOME FRIENDS,</HI> and might be of &s;ome &s;ervice in mitigating the fate of the late King.</P>
<P>The words of Mr. Shirving, "SOME FRIENDS," have been <HI>curiou&s;ly</HI> repre&s;ented.&mdash;It is &s;tated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the&s;e <Q><HI>&s;ome friends,</HI></Q> mu&s;t have been the members of that truly re|&s;pectable Society; and it is boldly argued, that I went to France as a Mi&s;&s;ionary from that body. Nothing can be more ridiculous.&mdash;Nothing can be more injurious.&mdash;Mr. Skirving never &s;aid &s;o!&mdash;No per&s;on can, or <HI>dare,</HI> &s;ay that I ever went as a mi&s;&s;ionary, delegated from individuals, or by Societies, to any foreign power. Building then upon this un&s;ub&s;tantial ba&s;is of words, never uttered in evidence by Mr. Skirving, nor which ever could po&s;&s;ibly be uttered. I am accu&s;ed of a &s;pecies of high trea&s;on, in corre&s;ponding with a foreign power without any legal authority from home. The charge of corre&s;ponding with foreign power is equally ridiculous with the mi&s;repre&s;entation upon which it is founded; but let it be con&s;idered as &s;erious, I <HI>dare</HI> the proof.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="027633_0069_0FD55699A28EE898">I challenge the Pro&s;ecutor to adduce the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of evidence.</P>
<P>Yes; I will admit, I wrote to Mr. Skirving my intention of going to France; nor will I deny the motive. I &s;aw, in the execution of the late King, a &s;pecious pretext to plunge the country in war, and to extend the effu&s;ion of <HI>human blood</HI> to every corner of the world! I may have er|red. I may have acted from enthu&s;ia&s;m; but it was en|thu&s;ia&s;m in the cau&s;e of man. If, at the period when it was free to every per&s;on to publi&s;h their &s;entiments upon that awful que&s;tion. I wi&s;hed likewi&s;e to publi&s;h mine, can that be imputed to me as a crime? Can the intention of pleading the cau&s;e of mercy, of individual and of gene|ral humanity, be con&s;trued into guilt? If it can, I am then guilty. Has not the Pro&s;ecutor lamented that di&s;a&s;trous e|vent? And will he accu&s;e a man who wi&s;hed to prevent it? Who, with many friends to humanity, of every nation, and of every party, in private, in public, in conver&s;ation, and from the Pre&s;s, exerted their abilities to ward off an event which they fore&s;aw was to introduce years of blood and of &s;orrow! But allow, that at fir&s;t glance, my depar|ture from Scotland; my journey to Paris, afforded a pre|&s;umption of guilt; that pre&s;umption is obviated by my RETURN.</P>
<P>The Pro&s;ecutor has boa&s;ted of his humanity, in granting me the delay of a few weeks, by po&s;tponing my trial, in order that I might return from Paris.&mdash;But was <HI>he</HI> igno|rant that ho&s;tilities at <HI>that time</HI> were commencing&mdash;that the communication was clo&s;ed; that it was tedious and diffi|cult to procure pa&s;&s;ports. Of that difficulty no per&s;on here can po&s;&s;ibly have any doubt.</P>
<P>Do not all my private letters, which have this day been read, prove my unea&s;ine&s;s upon account of the delay, and my anxiety to return? But, at the period when I procured my pa&s;&s;port, the flames of war were blazing over mo&s;t of Europe&mdash;I knew only two ways by which I could po&s;|&s;ibly return home. The fir&s;t, by the way of Hamburgh; the &s;econd by the longer, but the more certain circuit of America.&mdash;I adopt the latter, as more &s;afe, and le&s;s li|able to interruption.&mdash;I left Paris.&mdash;I went down to the
<PB N="70" REF="027633_0070_0FD61911EE7BA498">
port of Havre-de-Grace. I found a ve&s;&s;el which was to &s;ail for New York&mdash;The receipt found in my pocket book, when I was &s;topped upon my landing in Scotland, from the ma&s;ter of that ve&s;&s;el for the payment of my pa&s;|&s;age, proves that I had actually taken my pa&s;&s;age in that &s;hip. That ve&s;&s;el, in taking in her freight, and by an embargo, was detained for near three months.&mdash;In this interval, another American &s;hip, the Hope, of Bal|timore, arrived. The Captain was to touch in at Bel|fa&s;t, in Ireland, for part of his cargo, on his return to A|merica.&mdash; This I con&s;idered to be a fortunate accident.&mdash;I immediately embraced this opportunity of returning by the way of Ireland to my country, not to implore favour, not to a&s;k protection, but to DEMAND ju&s;tice. To pa&s;s from France, to any of the dominions of Britain, I had no pa&s;&s;|port,&mdash;my pa&s;&s;port was to America. I braved every dan|ger. After a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age I was landed in Ireland. There I remained no longer than nine days. I concealed not my name, I appeared publicly, and in the places of mo&s;t pub|lic re&s;ort. To all I announced my &s;ituation and intention. The Pro&s;ecutor has either de&s;ignedly, or ignorantly, laid hold of the circum&s;tance of the indor&s;ation of the muni|cipal officers of Havre-de-Grace, upon my pa&s;&s;port. The Deparment of Paris granted me a pa&s;&s;port in the end of the month of April, and I arrived at Havre on the 3d or 4th of May. The fir&s;t &s;tep which a &s;tranger is obliged to take, upon arriving at the place of his de&s;tination in France, is to proceed to the Municipality, to &s;hew to them the pa&s;&s;|port from whence he came, to have it revi&s;ed and atte&s;ted by them, in order to enjoy &s;ecurity within their juri&s;dic|tion. The indor&s;ation, as I have &s;tated, of my Pari&s;ian pa&s;&s;port, by the municipal officers at Havre, is of the 3d or 4th of May la&s;t. From this circum&s;tance the Lord Ad|vocate infers, that I mu&s;t immediately have found a ve&s;&s;el to carry me home. He makes no allowance for the &s;tate of the two nations; he makes no allowance for the difficul|ties which neutral ve&s;&s;els have, in pa&s;&s;ing betwixt both; and he knows nothing of the embargoes which the&s;e ve&s;|&s;els mu&s;t con&s;tantly experience, in the different belligerent ports. Well, then, &s;ometime in the month of May I
<PB N="71" REF="027633_0071_0FD5569EDA9B3FB0">
mu&s;t have landed in Ireland! Public report has &s;aid, that in&s;urrections have been in that country. The Pro&s;ecutor has cried out, That I was the daemon of &s;edition! And he in&s;inuates, that there is a probability that I was the cau&s;e of the&s;e in&s;urrections. I &s;mile at the accu&s;ation; which he him&s;elf in his own mind mu&s;t deride. It could have been ea&s;y for me, by the te&s;timonies of my friends in Ireland, whom I love, and whom I honour, to prove how I pa&s;&s;ed my time. But for me to dwell upon this is unnece&s;&s;ary. You, of the Jury, mu&s;t have experienced the &s;ame emotions, and at pre&s;ent indulge the &s;ame feelings as I do.</P>
<P>From Ireland, the Pro&s;ecutor &s;ays, I attempted to land in Scotland in a clande&s;tine manner; and &s;o &s;ays (his com|po&s;ition) the Indictment.</P>
<P>In the li&s;t of witne&s;&s;es adduced again&s;t me, I &s;aw the names of Carmichael, the per&s;on who fir&s;t recognized me at my landing at Portpatrick, and of Mr. Ro&s;s the magi|&s;trate at Stranraer, before whom I fir&s;t appeared. The Lord Advocate charges me with coming to Scotland in a clande&s;tine manner. He &s;erves upon me, in the li&s;t of wit|ne&s;&s;es, the only witne&s;&s;es who could prove the fact; Carmi|chael, the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer, and Mr. Ro&s;s the magi&s;trate, to whom I &s;urrendered. I expected Carmichael and that gen|tleman would have been inclo&s;ed with the other witne&s;&s;es of the Crown. I would have adduced them as witne&s;&s;es to prove that &s;o far from concealing my&s;elf, I announced my&s;elf pub|licly, and without di&s;gui&s;e; &s;o far from attempting eva&s;ion, my only anxiety was to put my&s;elf in the hands of the Law; and under the protection of its magi&s;trates. The conduct of the Public Pro&s;ecutor, is in every re&s;pect uniform. He is guilty of another piece of di&s;ingenuity, by &s;erving upon me in the li&s;t of the witne&s;&s;es of the Crown, the names of Carmichael and Ro&s;s. I could not entertain the lea&s;t po&s;|&s;ible doubt, but that they were to be adduced. This was an art to prevent me citing them at my own in&s;tance. It has &s;ucceeded. I am deprived of their te&s;timony. But why did not the Pro&s;ecutor, at lea&s;t, produce the declaration which I made before the Magi&s;trate at Stranraer: That de|claration, freely and voluntarily emitted, would have proved that I came into the country in no unbecoming manner.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="027633_0072_0FD61912E374A130">Much of the invective of the Pro&s;ecutor was founded up|on my coming into this country in concealment.

<P>I tru&s;t, now you will be convinced, that no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt led me from Scotland, no improper motive carried me from England to France; and that no deep, and &s;ecret intention, induced me to return in di&s;gui&s;e to my country. The object of that return was to demand ju&s;tice, to wipe away the imputation of that crime of which I now &s;tand charged. And what is that crime? Sedition.&mdash;Is there a term &s;o vague and &s;o undefined, &s;o familiar to power, &s;o fa|miliar to corruption. All who ever dared to oppo&s;e AR|BITRARY POWER, and who in the hour of danger came forward to &s;ave their country, have been branded by the epithet of &s;editious. The term is therefore no longer a term of opprobrium. In one age, it has been applied to men re|jected by &s;ociety, who&s;e names were honoured by after times, and upon who&s;e virtues, and upon who&s;e &s;ufferings, the &s;uc|ceeding age reared the maje&s;tic pillar of the con&s;titution. I am then accu&s;ed of &s;edition, and I a&s;k you of the Jury, to point out the corner of this land where &s;edition has exi&s;ted. And tell me truly where the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige of this crime has appeared. Upon you the eyes of the people are now placed. Upon your con&s;ciences the oath of God is binding. Point out then to us, where the &s;hadow of &s;edition has been de&s;cried. Have the &s;acred rights of property been any where invaded? Has the blood of the citizens flowed by the hands of the Friends of the People? O! No.&mdash;But the Pro|&s;ecutor has talked of the danger the People of this country were in la&s;t winter, of deep-laid plots, and of tremendous con&s;piracies! and I am the man, whom he charges as the au|thor of the whole, whom he repre&s;ents &s;imilar in malignity to the daemon of mi&s;chief! and whom he honours with the ti|tle of the <HI>pe&s;t of Scotland!</HI> Well then, let it be &s;uppo&s;ed that an attempt was formed to overthrow the Con&s;titution, to

kindle the torch of civil war, to lead rapine and murder along the land; Where has the proof of this de&s;ign been found? Has it been di&s;covered in the meetings of the Friends of the People&punc; who, con&s;cious of the purity of their intentions, af|fected no concealment, a&s;&s;embled with doors open to all; and who hatched their helli&s;h de&s;igns, (if &s;uch they were) in no midnight cavern. Could in the crouds, that were admitted to attend the deliberations of the&s;e &s;ocieties, be found no ru&s;&s;ian, who could at lea&s;t give a bold and manly te&s;timony again&s;t them, and again&s;t me? But to &s;upport the accu&s;ation, the walls of a private hou&s;e mu&s;t be invaded; do|me&s;tic &s;ecrets mu&s;t be explored, and the te&s;timony of a mi|&s;erable &s;cullion girl, and a hair-dre&s;&s;er, mu&s;t be brought for|ward, with regard to words, &s;poken where &s;u&s;picion the mo&s;t vigilant mu&s;t have been a&s;leep, under the guardian&s;hip of a paternal roof. And are the&s;e the witne&s;&s;es, who are to prove again&s;t me this mighty crime, which, &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>them</HI> to have been honoured by my confidence, would have requir|ed the co-operation of thou&s;ands of bearded men in arms.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury, Let us this night throw away vain pretext: Let us act fairly and candidly. I &s;mile at the charge of &s;edition. You your&s;elves are con&s;cious that no &s;edition has exi&s;ted in this country, and in your own minds you deride the accu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation. I know for what I am brought to this bar; it is for having &s;trenuou&s;ly and active|ly engaged in the cau&s;e of Parliamentary Reform; for hav|ing exerted every effort, by con&s;titutional mea&s;ures, to pro|cure an equal repre&s;entation of the people, in the Hou&s;e of the People. Let not the Pro&s;ecutor &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulk in darkne&s;s: Let him come manfully forward, and av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w the cau&s;e which has impelled him to bring me here. I will give you little trouble: I will prevent the la&s;&s;itude of the judges: I will &s;ave you, the Jury, from the wretched mockery of a trial, the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of condemning a man, when the cau&s;e of his condemnation mu&s;t be concealed, and cannot be explained. Yes, I plead guilty. I openly, actively, and &s;incere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y em|barked in the cau&s;e of a Parliamentary Reform, in the vindi|cation and in the re&s;toration of the rights of the people.

held up by the great and the venerable names of the living and of the dead. I contended for an equal repre&s;entation of the people, in what I &s;hall ever call the Hou&s;e of the Peo|ple, becau&s;e I con&s;idered it a mea&s;ure e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;alvation of the State, and to the &s;tability of your boa&s;ted con&s;titution. Wherein then con&s;i&s;ts the excellency of that time-tried fabric, cemented by the blood of your fathers, flowing from the field and from the &s;caffold. I will tell you: It con&s;i&s;ts in the due balance of its three im|pelling powers, KING, LORDS, and COMMONS; If one of the&s;e powers lo&s;es its vigour, the con&s;titution in pro|portion lo&s;es its vigour; If one of the&s;e powers becomes only a &s;hadow of what it ought to be, if it becomes merged and ab&s;orbed into any of the other two, your con|&s;titution then al&s;o becomes a &s;hadow, and it is annihilated. And do you not know, and does all the world not know, and if any were the proud &s;tructure of the con&s;titution has &s;uffered the ravages of time or of corruption, it is in its popular branch. Is it not a fact indi&s;putable, that the re|pre&s;entation of the people is not &s;uch as it once was, and is not &s;uch, as I tru&s;t in God, one day it &s;hall be. The man then who &s;ounds the alarm, when he di&s;covers the aproach of danger, who &s;ummons all who may be concerned in its reparation, is &s;urely no enemy to the country, no foe to the con&s;titution, becau&s;e he labours in its pre&s;ervation and pro|tection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And, as it is e&s;&s;ential to the very being of Parliament, that e|lections &s;hould be ab&s;olutely free, therefore all undue influences up|on the electors are illegal, and &s;trongly prohibited.

the repo&s;e of eternity, whom your fathers admired while living, and to whom you, their children, have erected &s;ta|tues. I have no time to run over all the venerable cata|logue. But, is there a man ignorant of the illu&s;trious Locke, and was not this &s;age in philo&s;ophy, this advanced champion the cau&s;e of liberty, and of man; this friend to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, who wrote his Treati&s;e on Go|vernment in its defence; in defence of the la&s;t glorious re|volution, by the de&s;ire of the Prince; who was the leader of the men who planned it;&mdash;was not he an advocate for a re|form in Parliament, for a more equal repre&s;entation of the Commons in the Hou&s;e of Commons? Will you venture to tear the records of <HI>his</HI> &s;ame, to &s;tigmatize <HI>his</HI> memory, and to brand <HI>him</HI> with the epithet of &s;editious?</P>
<P>Let us rapidly proceed down to more modern times. Let us pa&s;s over in &s;ilence many illu&s;trious names, who&s;e me|mory with that of the Con&s;titution will peri&s;h together. Let us come to your own days. Are ye ignorant of Black|&s;tone; &mdash;the man who fir&s;t collected the laws of his country, from the deformed chaos into which they had been thrown, who arranged them with elegancy, and who adorned them with every flower which the cla&s;&s;ic field could produce? Are not the volumes of this reverend judge in the hands of all? Should they not be familiar, at lea&s;t to tho&s;e who are cal|led to decide concerning the con&s;titution? And has not Black&s;tone, not with the levity of ill-pondered words, not in the private hour of relaxation, not in the heat of popu|lar debate, but in the calmne&s;s and &s;olitude of &s;tudy, main|tained the &s;ame propo&s;itions which I maintain, been guilty of the &s;ame &s;edition of which I am guilty, when he pro|nounced that the Con&s;titution was imperfect, in its popu|lar branch, and if any where ALTERATION was nece&s;&s;ary, it was there to be de&s;ired. I entreat you to li&s;ten. I will read you, what this be&s;t expounder of the con&s;titution has &s;aid. Let the words be engraved on the tablet of your hearts.</P>
<P><Q>And this con&s;titution of &s;uffrages is framed upon a wi&s;er principle, with us, than either of the methods of voting, by centuries or by tribes, among the Romans. In the method by centuries, in&s;tiuted by Servious Tul|lius,
<PB N="76" REF="027633_0076_0FD556A8A5BE3B40">
it was principally PROPERTY, and not numbers, that turned the &s;cale: in the method by tribes, gradually in|troduced by the tribunes of the people, NUMBERS only were regarded, and property was entirely overlooked. Hence the laws pa&s;&s;ed by the former method had u&s;ually too great a tendency to aggrandize the patricians or rich nobles; and tho&s;e by the latter had too much of a level|ling principle. Our con&s;titution &s;teers between the two extremes. Only &s;uch are entirely excluded, as can have no will of their own: there is hardly a free agent to be found, who is not entitled to a vote in &s;ome place or o|ther in the kingdom. Nor is comparative wealth or pro|perty entirely di&s;regarded in elections, for though the riche&s;t man has only one vote at one place, yet, if his pro|perty be at all diffu&s;ed, he has probably a right to vote at more places than one, and therefore has many repre&s;en|tatives. <HI>This is the SPIRIT OF OUR CONSTITU|TION: not that I a&s;&s;ert it is in fact quite &s;o perfect as I have here endeavoured to de&s;cribe it; for, if any ALTER|ATION might be wi&s;hed or &s;ugge&s;ted in the pre&s;ent frame of parliament,</HI> it &s;hould be <HI>in favour of a MORE COM|PLETE REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE.</HI></Q></P>
<P>If Black&s;tone then wi&s;hed for a more equal repre&s;entation of the people, if he dared to publi&s;h and to enforce his wi&s;h; and if I have merely done the &s;ame, where is the difference in ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> guilt? But there is a difference, and that difference is great. A learned profe&s;&s;or of the laws of England, in the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge, a grave writer, in the &s;olitude of his retirement, a &s;olemn judge, upon the tribunal of Eng|land, proclaiming that a reform in the repre&s;entation of the people was ju&s;t, and e&s;&s;ential to the true &s;pirit of the con|&s;titution; how &s;uperlatively criminal mu&s;t his conduct be when compared with mine?</P>
<P>But vengeance cea&s;es at the verge of the grave. There factions and parties rage in vain. If I have been guilty of an atrocious crime, I &s;hall not demand the protection of the dead, I &s;hall not wonder among the tombs, and cry for the &s;upport and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e who cannot hear me, but I &s;hall loudly demand the protection of the living, of men high in rank, exalted in power, and who enjoy the confi|dence
<PB N="77" REF="027633_0077_0FD556AA4795E500">
of their king. Can it ever be forgotten, that in the year 1782, Mr. Pitt was &s;tained with the &s;ame guilt? Did not he preach up the nece&s;&s;ity of a reform in the repre&s;ent|ation of the people? Did not he advi&s;e the people to form &s;ocieties; and did not he countenance the&s;e &s;ocieties, by his pre&s;ence? I appeal to the re&s;olutions which he &s;ub&s;cribed, in the Thatched Hou&s;e Tavern. I atte&s;t the motions which he made for Reform, in the Hou&s;e of Commons. Beware how you condemn me. Beware how you brand me with the opprobrium of being &s;editious. At the &s;ame time you condemn the confidential Mini&s;ter of the King. Nay more Sir, in bringing this charge again&s;t me you accu&s;e your Sovereign; for can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that he would permit a man to enjoy his confidence, who in the year 1782 by being a reformer, as I am in the year 1793, wi&s;hed to pre|cipitate this country into anarchy, de&s;olation, and, into all the horrors which you have de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>But if the attempt to procure a Reform in Parliament be criminal, your accu&s;ation mu&s;t extend far and wide. It mu&s;t implicate the Mini&s;ters of the Crown and the lowe&s;t &s;ubjects. Have you forgotten that in the year 1782, the Duke of Richmond, the pre&s;ent Commander of the forces, was a flaming advocate for the univer&s;al right of &s;uffrage? Do you not know, that he pre&s;ided in &s;ocieties, and like Mr. Pitt, advi&s;ed an univer&s;al formation of &s;uch &s;ocieties all over the kingdom? Have you never read his famous letter to Colonel S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">win, in which his principles, his te&s;timony, to a full and complete repre&s;entation of the people, are indelibly recorded? Is guilt the pa&s;&s;ing un&s;ub|&s;tantial fa&s;hion of the day? Does it vary according to times and to &s;ea&s;ons, and to circum&s;tances? Shall what was pa|trioti&s;m in 1782, be criminal in 1793? You have honour|ed me this night, by the title of the pe&s;t of Scotland. And if the &s;ame offences merit the &s;ame appellations, you mu&s;t likewi&s;e liberally be&s;tow this epithet upon the fir&s;t Lord of the trea&s;ury, and upon the Commander of the forces. But what term of &s;uper-eminent di&s;tinction will not you, the Public Pro&s;ecutor; you the Lord Advocate for Scotland, appropriate to your&s;elf? Were not you, not many months ago, likewi&s;e a reformer? Did you not contend and act
<PB N="78" REF="027633_0078_0FD61915E2B26A70">
for a more equal repre&s;entation of the people in the Hou&s;e of Commons? Were not you one of tho&s;e men, who, for that purpo&s;e, a&s;&s;embled lately in this city, in what they called a Convention, and a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the title of Delegates from the Counties? Were not you, your&s;elf, em|ployed in framing a bill for the extention of the elective franchi&s;e? Every charge in your indictment again&s;t me re|coils upon your&s;elf; in accu&s;ing me, you charge your&s;elf with &s;edition. If it was lawful for you and your friends to meet in &s;ocieties, and in conventions, for the purpo&s;e of a Reform in Parliament, unle&s;s the &s;tandard of guilt &s;hrinks and extends as caprice or power may order, it &s;urely mu&s;t have been permitted to me and my friends al&s;o to meet, and to act on the &s;ame principle.</P>
<P>But I advance in this tract no farther, although my a&s;|&s;ertions and my arguments are ju&s;t, yet the &s;ubject of them is &s;o connected with ridicule, as to render them not &s;o &s;eem|ing in this &s;olemn trial.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury, If the real cau&s;e of my &s;tanding as a Pannel at your bar, is for having actively engaged in the cau&s;e of a Parliamentary Reform, I plead guilty. My con&s;cience, however, will whi&s;per con&s;olation to me under my condemnation. I engaged in that cau&s;e, for I thought the mea&s;ure was to &s;ave the country; that a more equal re|pre&s;entation would dry up the &s;ources of corruption, would dimini&s;h our taxes, and &s;top the effu&s;ion of our blood. That &s;uch were my motives, appears from every part of the evidence again&s;t me. The Public Pro&s;ecutor &s;hrunk from the examination, even of the te&s;timony of his own witne&s;&s;es. He averted his eyes from the proof, in order to indulge him&s;elf in vain declamation and unbecoming invec|tive. I will not, however, imitate his conduct. I will exa|mine minutely every branch of the proof which he has ad|duced again&s;t me; and you will be convinced that after eve|ry word and action of mine has been &s;crutinized; after even the levity of the mo&s;t unguarded hour has been explored, and while in&s;tructed &s;pies have watched every book, had marked every word, not the ve&s;tige of &s;edition can be di&s;|covered.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t charge again&s;t me is, That at meetings of the
<PB N="79" REF="027633_0079_0FD556AE9F62B6B8">
people which I my&s;elf had convocated, I made &s;editious ha|rangues; vilified the King and con&s;titution; repre&s;ented the monarchical part of our government as cumber&s;ome and expen&s;ive; in&s;tituted a compari&s;on betwixt our &s;y&s;tem and that of France, and did every thing to inflame the minds of the people to in&s;urrection and rebellion. It is particularly alledged that I was guilty of the&s;e crimes at two meetings, the one at Camp&s;ie, and the other at Kirkintilloch.</P>
<P>To prove this charge, Alexander John&s;tone is adduced. You will remember, that I offered to prove that this wit|ne&s;s had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the mo&s;t rancorous terms a|gain&s;t me; that he would do all in his power to get me hanged. By re&s;pectable witne&s;&s;es, I could ea&s;ily have &s;up|ported this averment; but I was not allowed by the Court, as I could not &s;pecify the particular cau&s;e which had excit|ed the malice of a man I did not know, and whom I do not remember to have ever &s;een. But what does even John&s;tone &s;ay? I will read you from my notes the whole of his evidence. Correct me if I have erred in taking down any thing differently from what has been &s;tated. I believe that my notes are accurate, but mi&s;takes are not im|po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>[Here Mr. Muir read over the whole of the evidence.]</HI></P>
<P>What does this witne&s;s then &s;ay? He &s;ays, that I &s;tated, in the meeting at Camp&s;ie, the di&s;advantages in the repre|&s;entation, from boroughs being rotten, and from others ha|ving no vote, the population of England and Scotland, the &s;mall number of electors in both; and that the people were not fully repre&s;ented. And is this &s;edition? Is not the fact notoriou&s;ly true? Has it not been re&s;ounded innu|merable times within the walls of the Hou&s;e of Commons it&s;elf? Has not the table of that Hou&s;e been covered with petitions, expre&s;&s;ing it in language infinitely &s;tronger than mine? If to &s;tate truth be &s;edition, why did our legi&s;lature &s;lumber? Why &s;lumbered the law; and why was not pub|lic vengeance armed with the &s;word of ju&s;tice, when this crime dared to pollute the &s;anctuary of the legi&s;lature, by its appearance within it?</P>
<P>John&s;tone depones, that I &s;aid, If a man gave 20,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> for a &s;eat in parliament, he behoved to derive &s;ome intere&s;t from
<PB N="80" REF="027633_0080_0FD556B01A0D76D0">
it. Is not the fact true? Do not we daily know of &s;ums of money being given for &s;eats in that hou&s;e, and can there be a conclu&s;ion in Euclid, more certain than the inference which I draw from the fact? It may be &s;aid, that the Hou&s;e may be pure and uncorrupted, even although &s;uch &s;ums of money are given for admi&s;&s;ion into it; that men may do &s;o in or|der to &s;erve their country, or to di&s;play their abilities.&mdash; Grant all this; but have we not &s;een much greater &s;ums thrown away at conte&s;ted elections, by men who never o|pened their mouths within the walls of St Stephen's Cha|pel; who&s;e patrioti&s;m never &s;hone forth; and who&s;e abili|ties were never di&s;covered? The witne&s;s depones, that I &s;aid the Duke of Richmond had been bribed into &s;ilence by 20 or 30,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> And &s;uppo&s;ing I had &s;aid &s;o, that this was the &s;alutary opiate, which calmed and cooled the fever of his brain, and probably &s;aved him the mortification of &s;tanding his trial, al&s;o, for the crime of &s;edition; what has this to do with the pre&s;ent matter? It is not the Duke of Rich|mond, but it is the king him&s;elf that I am accu&s;ed of vili|fying. This a&s;&s;ertion of John&s;tone's is indeed too ludicrous for &s;erious argument.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, before I proceed farther, let me make one remark. I am to be tried by the law of Scotland; and, by that law, two witne&s;&s;es are nece&s;&s;ary to prove a crime.&mdash; This is a rule full of humanity; but, at the &s;ame time, by cut|ting off proof, it may, and has upon &s;ome occa&s;ions defeated the ends of public ju&s;tice. If, however, the concurrence of two witne&s;&s;es were to be rigorou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon, it mu&s;t be in a ca&s;e &s;imilar to mine, where their te&s;timony is to go to words, <HI>volantia verba,</HI> neither engraved in marble, nor recorded in bra&s;s. You know the infinite variety of cir|cum&s;tances depending upon the &s;peaker, the occa&s;ion, the manner, the per&s;on to whom they were uttered, and his &s;ituation; by which, the meaning of the &s;ame words, can be diver&s;ified and modified, tortured into guilt, and ex|plained into innocence. By the law of England, which is likewi&s;e the &s;ame with ours in the ca&s;e of trea&s;on, the bare uttering of words, without any overt act, cannot be admit|ted us evidence to prove the crime.</P>
<P>John&s;tone depones, that I compared our con&s;titution with
<PB N="81" REF="027633_0081_0FD6191CF4D91D20">
the French, and &s;aid that their arms would be &s;ucce&s;sful&punc; that their repre&s;entation was more equal; two thirds of their debt paid, and that their manufacturers, in the com|petion with ours, would have the advantage. Whoever heard before, that it was unlawful to compare the Briti&s;h con&s;titution with that of another country? If the Briti&s;h con&s;titution is the boa&s;t of ages, the pride and glory of the world, Can it &s;uffer by any compari&s;on? On the con|trary; will not its &s;plendour brighten by the foil? But does John&s;tone &s;ay, that I gave the &s;uperiority to the French con&s;titution over the Briti&s;h? No.&mdash;Does he a&s;&s;ert, that I exhorted the meeting to reject the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, to adopt the French, and to adopt the French as the better model? No; not a word. What then &s;ays he? That I merely compared the two together. Is this &s;edition?&mdash; Alas! we are all &s;editious. Is there a man here, or in this country, who has not, in his own mind, and who has not in words, made a &s;imilar compari&s;on?</P>
<P>John&s;tone next ob&s;erves, That I mentioned, that two thirds of the French national debt was already paid; that their taxes were le&s;s, and that I a&s;cribed this to the people being more equally repre&s;ented in their legi&s;lator. I may have &s;aid &s;o, or I may have not &s;aid &s;o. My remembrance does not carry me. Whether the fact was true at that time that I &s;poke in the meeting, of two thirds of their national debt being paid, and of their taxes being le&s;s, I know not. Certain it is, before and &s;ince, I have often heard it to be &s;o, in word and in writing; but I will &s;ay this to you, and I will &s;ay it to all Scotland, that an equal repre&s;entation of the people is the mo&s;t direct and &s;alutary method to dimini&s;h and pay off the national debt; to alleviate the weight of taxes, and to remove the clogs of indu&s;try. No|thing can be truer than the inference which John&s;tone &s;ays I drew, that a people equally indu&s;trious, mu&s;t have the advantage over another, who pay greater taxes, and who groan under the burden of a greater debt. If I were con|nected with this la&s;t nation, I certainly would advi&s;e them to take every con&s;titutional &s;tep to procure a diminution of their debt and of their taxes. And what does Mr. John|&s;tone &s;ay? That I advi&s;ed the &s;ociety to petition Parlia|ment,
<PB N="82" REF="027633_0082_0FD556B31B36C048">
and that the &s;ole intention of the&s;e &s;ocieties was to pro|cure a more equal repre&s;entation and a &s;horter duration of Parliaments. Do you &s;ay then that the object of the&s;e &s;o|cieties is uncon&s;titutional? Or do you &s;ay, that the&s;e &s;ocie|ties, in the means which I advi&s;ed them to make u&s;e of in order to accompli&s;h that object, were to act uncon&s;titution|ally? You can do neither. Under the free government of Britain, every man has a right to look after tho&s;e whom he is &s;uppo&s;ed to delegate to the Hou&s;e of Commons, to be the arbiters of his liberty, his fortune, his life. He has a right to come and &s;tate to them his wrongs and his appre|hen&s;ions; and the mode which the con&s;titution has pointed out is by petition.</P>
<P>John&s;tone depones, that I advi&s;ed the people to con&s;ult together to communicate and diffu&s;e their knowledge: The advice was a good advice; and &s;uch an advice as I would give were I &s;till in the &s;ame &s;ituation. What! Is the time now come when the mind mu&s;t be locked up; when fetters mu&s;t be impo&s;ed upon the under&s;tanding, and when the people, the great ma&s;s of human being, mu&s;t be prohibited to receive information, and to communicate among them|&s;elves the information which they may have received. Mi|&s;erable people.&mdash;Country to be deplored!&mdash;Ignorance is the &s;ource from which de&s;poti&s;m flows. The remembrance of former liberties will make you only more wretched. Ex|tingui&s;h then (if po&s;&s;ible) the light of heaven, and let us grope, and let us &s;earch for con&s;olation, if it can be found, under the darkne&s;s which &s;hall &s;oon cover us. But the pro&s;pect before us is not &s;o di&s;mal.&mdash;We live, and we act under the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. A con&s;titution which, in its genuine principles, has for ages con&s;ecrated freedom. We live, and we remember the glorious revolution of 1688, which bani&s;hed de&s;poti&s;m, and placed the family of Hano|ver upon the throne. We remember the Bill of Rights; nor &s;hall we forget one of its mo&s;t &s;acred clau&s;es, which declar|ed, e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;anctioned the unalienable claim of the citizen to petition Parliament. Now, as members of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, acting under the Bill of Rights, how &s;hould our Conduct be &s;haped? Do we complain of general grievances, &s;uch as, an unequal repre&s;entation of the peo|ple?
<PB N="83" REF="027633_0083_0FD6191E3108B048">
It would be arrogance in a part to &s;peak the language of the whole. Let tho&s;e, then, who feel mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly the pre&s;&s;ure of this general grievance, not pre&s;ume to complain for the nation, but con&s;ult the nation. And how are they then to con&s;ult the nation, but by bringing the people to|gether in &s;ocieties, to deliberate and to re&s;olve? Would you wi&s;h the people to act unadvi&s;edly. Would you pro|po&s;e they &s;hould carry petitions to the doors of the Hou&s;e of Commons, without knowing the real &s;ignification of the import of the&s;e petitions? Let us apply to our political con|duct a rule &s;ure and unerring in private life.&mdash;Think; deli|berate before you act. An unequal repre&s;entation is a ge|neral grievance.&mdash;Before we &s;eek to obtain its redre&s;s, let us enquire, in the fir&s;t place, if it is generally felt; and in the &s;econd, if redre&s;s is generally wi&s;hed for. In applying for a general remedy, let us fir&s;t be convinced of the general di&s;ea&s;e. Without this, a few factious may pre&s;ume to &s;peak for the nation; may impo&s;e upon the weak, and may plunge the <HI>many</HI> into inextricable confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery. The great propo&s;ition, then, which I maintained is, that the peo|ple &s;hould con&s;ult together; that they &s;hould form them&s;elves into &s;ocieties; for it is only by &s;o doing that they can con|duct them&s;elves with wi&s;dom, and hope for &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Bill of Rights declared the unalienable, impre&s;crip|tible right of the people to petition Parliament, and if you condemn me for advi&s;ing the people to petition with reflec|tion, with united and general deliberation, for redre&s;s of general grievances, ye tear the record of our liberties, and &s;catter the fragments where they never can be collected.</P>
<P>In advi&s;ing then, even according to John&s;tone's evidence, the people to inform them&s;elves, reciprocally to communi|cate their information, and then wi&s;ely and deliberately to petition Parliament, you do not condemn me, but you tram|ple upon their liberties, and you pro&s;cribe the con&s;titu|tion. If I declared, at the meeting of Camp&s;ie, that the peo|ple &s;hould adopt every mean to in&s;truct them&s;elves with re|gard to their political rights, I declare and I inculcate the &s;ame now before you, and before this great audience.</P>
<P>Hear farther what Mr. John&s;tone &s;ays. I have his words accurately in my notes. I advi&s;ed the &s;ociety to get ALL
<PB N="84" REF="027633_0084_0FD556B79B3B7368">
the political pamphlets from a neighbouring book&s;eller.&mdash;The advice was a right advice. I did not li&s;t my&s;elf under the banners of faction. I combated neither for mini&s;try nor for oppo&s;ition, for the ins nor for the outs; I fought in the cau&s;e of truth, and how is that cau&s;e to be &s;ucce&s;s|ful, but by general, complete, and impartial information <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the different arguments, advanced upon either &s;ide of the great que&s;tion of Parliamentary Reform? Gentlemen, re|member who the witne&s;s is, who brings forward this im|portant truth in my favour. It is Alexander John&s;tone, the fir&s;t witne&s;s adduced by the Pro&s;ecutor, again&s;t whom I objected on account of the expre&s;&s;ions which he had u&s;ed indicating his intention to ruin me, which by re&s;pectable witne&s;&s;es I offered, in&s;tantly, to prove, but which proof was not allowed by the Court. When this man &s;peaks what is &s;trongly in my favour, you cannot &s;u&s;pect him; nay more, what he has &s;aid, affords a clue to my conduct. Fond of reading my&s;elf, purcha&s;ing, for information, almo&s;t every new publication, was it not natural and ju&s;t for me to re|commend a &s;imilar lin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of conduct to men, who, from their union, were enabled to defray the expence? If I had been the tool of party and of factions; if truth had not been my object, I would have &s;aid to this &s;ociety, 'purcha&s;e not the books which are written again&s;t Parliamentary Reform; they are merely the productions of pen&s;ioned hirelings; but read every treati&s;e written in its defence.&mdash;The&s;e are the productions of enlightened, and of philanthropic men, and they are &s;tamped by the &s;ignature of genius.' You will remember what the witne&s;s has &s;aid upon the interrogatory of the Solicitor General, relative to what I mentioned con|cerning the King, Lords, and Commons; What was the re|ply of the witne&s;s? It was this, that I &s;aid, the con&s;titution ought to con&s;i&s;t of King, Lords, and Commons. Is this vi|lifying the Monarchy? Is this repre&s;enting that part of the government as expen&s;ive and cumber&s;ome, as the indict|ment &s;ets forth? Is this inflaming the minds of the people, and exciting them to in&s;urrection and rebellion?</P>
<P>This witne&s;s has likewi&s;e deponed to a remarkable fact. I will &s;tate you his words accurately. If I am in error, you will correct me from your notes. <Q>In that meeting there
<PB N="85" REF="027633_0085_0FD556B931B9C838">
was mention made of Paine's Rights of Man, but not by Mr. Muir. One man in the &s;ociety, not in a public man|ner, but to his neighbour privately, &s;aid; that he had read Paine's Works.</Q> What was that to me? And &s;uppo&s;ing I had overheard this man u&s;e the&s;e words; could I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> blamed for merely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the faculty of hearing? Does John&s;tone &s;ay, that I participated in this private conver&s;a|tion? He &s;ays no &s;uch thing. Does he &s;wear that I recom|mended Paine's Works, or introduced the mention of them in the meeting? No. How then is the other charge in the indictment &s;upported by the te&s;timony of this witne&s;s?&mdash; of my advi&s;ing the people to read &s;editious books, and cir|culating &s;uch among them.</P>
<P>John&s;tone has told you, that mo&s;t of tho&s;e who compo&s;ed this meeting were weavers, mo&s;tly young men from eighteen to twenty years of age. What is the inference which the Lord Advocate has deduced from this? I blu&s;h to mention it,&mdash; That people, in that &s;ituation, and at that time of life, have no right to interfere in public affairs! People, in that &s;ituation! What &s;ituation? Who compo&s;e the great ma&s;s of &s;ociety? Who &s;upport the State? Who contribute to its wealth? Who mu&s;t fight in its defence? People at that period of life!&mdash;What period? When the heart is uncorrupted; when the &s;oil is be&s;t prepared to receive good &s;eed, and when the feelings of the mind can be mo&s;t ea&s;ily led over to the &s;ide of virtue and humanity. Becau&s;e the majority of the mem|bers of that &s;ociety might be weavers, they mu&s;t be held up in deri&s;ion! Becau&s;e the majority of them might be young men, they mu&s;t be cen&s;ured for pre&s;uming to inte|re&s;t them&s;elves in the happine&s;s of that country in which they were to &s;pend their future days, and who&s;e con&s;titu|tion was to operate upon their future lives! But you have &s;een &s;everal of the members of that &s;ociety, and tho&s;e too adduced by the Pro&s;ecutor, (Mr. John&s;tone in the number) and did you think them &s;o young, &s;o frivolous, and &s;o ill-taught as he repre&s;ented? This is a matter which regards you, as you were the witne&s;&s;es, and you mu&s;t judge for your&s;elves. Finally, hear the conclu&s;ion of the depo&s;ition of this witne&s;s, which &s;tates, <Q>That I recommended peace and regularity to the meeting, and ob&s;erved that any tu|mult
<PB N="86" REF="027633_0086_0FD556BA98FD4338">
or di&s;order would ruin their common cau&s;e;</Q> and that I told them, <Q>there was no other mode of procuring redre&s;s, but by applying to parliament;</Q> and that I re|commended to them <Q>to beware of admitting any immoral characters as members.</Q></P>
<P>The next witne&s;s adduced for the Pro&s;ecutor, is Robert Waddell, vice pre&s;ident of the &s;ociety at Kirkintilloch, who &s;wears to the particulars which occurred at the &s;ame meeting, in which the preceding witne&s;s was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>[Mr. Muir then read over his notes of this witne&s;s's depo|&s;ition.]</HI></P>
<P>In what re&s;pect does this witne&s;s criminate me? Does he not agree preci&s;ely with John&s;tone, concerning my gene|ral conduct. I am accu&s;ed of vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ifying the king and con&s;ti|tution; and what does this witne&s;s &s;ay? That I made a &s;peech, in which I advi&s;ed regularity in their proceedings; and that they ought to proceed in a con&s;titutional manner, as the law now is, by King, Lords, and Commons. The indictment alledges, that I &s;poke and reprobated the mo|narchical branch of the con&s;titution. But the witne&s;s &s;wears, that I &s;aid nothing about the expence of the King, nor the comparitive expence of the French con&s;titution, nor the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms. Gentlemen, I &s;peak with candour; it is not in my remembrance, that I &s;poke con|cerning the comparative excellency of the French or Briti&s;h constitutions. You hear one witne&s;s declaring, that I mere|ly compared them together; you hear this witne&s;s declare, that I made no mention of either con&s;titution; both of them may have &s;poken truth according to the impre&s;&s;ion which was on their minds, but they &s;hew you the danger of tru&s;t|ing to the memory of witne&s;&s;es, when it relates to words &s;poken in the warmth of a public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and attempted to be recollected after the lap&s;e of many months. But give what&s;oever degree of &s;trength you chu&s;e to John&s;tone's evi|dence, draw from the compari&s;on, which I in&s;tituted be|tween the French and Briti&s;h con&s;titutions, an inference as highly criminal as you po&s;&s;ibly can; the te&s;timony of that man is completely overthrown by this witne&s;s. Mr. Wad|dell has &s;tated to you what pa&s;&s;ed after the meeting was o|ver, in private company, in the unguarded hour, when
<PB N="87" REF="027633_0087_0FD6191FE0EBD370">
the mind dreads no danger, and when vigilance is a&s;leep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Can any thing prove more &s;trongly than the depo&s;ition of this man, the innocency of my conduct? The conver&s;ation related to politics, and to new publications; and &s;urely materials of that kind are infinitely more noble in their na|ture, than tho&s;e which deform convivial &s;ociety, and di&s;|grace the man. He remembers me &s;peaking of Mr. Flower's boook upon the French con&s;titution; a book which the Lord Advocate, although not &s;pecified in the libel, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed to in&s;inuate as being &s;editious, and con&s;equent|ly an aggravation of my crime. Of the truly re&s;pectable author of this book, I know nothing; but if, from writ|ing, a true idea may be formed of the heart which guides the pen, there is no man that I would more fondly call my friend. It is true, I recommended Mr. Flower there, becau&s;e I recommended his principles every where. I will do &s;o &s;till; I will do &s;o in your pre&s;ence, in the pre&s;ence of the Court, and to this great audience. You, who wi&s;h for a Reform in Parliament, read and weigh well the le&s;|&s;ons, which this good man has given and inculcated. Let per&s;onal reformation precede public; let the torch, of know|ledge lighten the path of liberty; but above all, let &s;ound morality, and genuine Chri&s;tianity be the goals from which you commence your political career. A people ignorant&mdash; never can enjoy freedom; a people immoral&mdash;are unworthy of the ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The witne&s;s next mentions, that the only book which I recommended to be purcha&s;ed, was Dr. Henry's Hi&s;tory of England. I am an enemy to the con&s;titution,&mdash;and yet I recommended to the people the book be&s;t calculated to in&s;truct them in its principles, and in its progre&s;s; a book, applauded in private and in public by the Earl of Man&s;|field, and upon who&s;e application, the author received an honourable pen&s;ion from the King; honourable to the gran|ter, to the receiver, and to him who fir&s;t noticed the mode&s;t merit of the writer.</P>
<P>The witne&s;s next proceeds to mention, that at the meet|ing, a per&s;on of the name of Boyd propo&s;ed, that Paine's Works &s;hould be purcha&s;ed and recommended. What was my conduct upon the occa&s;ion? I &s;aid, it was foreign to
<PB N="88" REF="027633_0088_0FD556BDA32D3BD8">
their purpose; and foreign, &s;urely, indeed it was. With|out approving of Mr. Paine's principles, without condemn|ing them, I &s;hall afterwards more fully &s;hew you, that the advice was &s;uch as became them and me, in our &s;ituation at the time.</P>
<P>The witne&s;s mentions, that he purcha&s;ed for the Society three or four copies of the Political Progre&s;s. Does he &s;ay, that it was at my de&s;ire, or on my recommendation? No.&mdash;That he purcha&s;ed for his own u&s;e, and that of his neigh|bours, three or four copies of the Pai&s;ley Declaration of Rights; that he got a copy of Paine's pamphlet, but knows not from whom; that he never &s;aw the Dialogue betwixt the Governors and the Governed, one of the charges a|gain&s;t me in the libel; and that a Mr. William Muir &s;hew|ed him a number of the Patriot. In the name of common &s;en&s;e, what connection have I with this extraneous matter&punc; How does it tend towards my crimination? The witne&s;s &s;wears po&s;itively, that the only book which I recommended to be purcha&s;ed by the Society, was Henry's Hi&s;tory of Britain.</P>
<P>The witne&s;s declared, that a more equal repre&s;entatiion of the people was the object of the Society. Being a&s;ked by the Solicitor General, what he meant by a more equal re|pre&s;entation. He &s;topt for a moment to con&s;ider. O! what matter of triumph was this! Then bur&s;t the contemptuous &s;neer; and then with affected ridicule was pointed out, the ab&s;urdity of men &s;o ignorant, embarking in the cau&s;e of reformation, when even their Vice Pre&s;ident, the witne&s;s who from his &s;tation, if any had known, he &s;hould have been the man. But by all, excepting by Mr. Pitt and the Duke of Richmond, who contended for reformation, no &s;pecific plan has yet been propo&s;ed. In all that was &s;aid in the late debate in the Hou&s;e of Commons, no &s;pecific plan was brought forward. Is it then a matter of &s;urpri&s;e that the witne&s;s &s;topt for a moment to con&s;ider his an&s;wer to the que&s;tion? His an&s;wer was &s;uch as did honour to the cool|ne&s;s of his mind, and to the foundne&s;s of his under&s;tanding, Two opinions, replied he, divided the Society. One was, for confining the right of election to landed property; the other, for extending it to the body of the people; that he;
<PB N="89" REF="027633_0089_0FD556BF389058C0">
for his own part, had not yet made up his mind upon either. Being a&s;ked my opinion, he &s;wears, I gave none.</P>
<P>The witne&s;s depones to my expre&s;s language, that I &s;aid to the meeting, that they would be the more &s;ucce&s;sful, the more they were con&s;titutional. Is this preaching up &s;edi|tion? Is this inflaming the minds of the multitude to rebel|lion? With every witne&s;s adduced again&s;t me this day, this witne&s;s likewi&s;e corroborates my earne&s;t advices to the people to be regular, to be moderate, and to be moral.</P>
<P>The next witne&s;s propo&s;ed to be adduced again&s;t me was, the Reverend James Lap&s;lie. My objections to his admi&s;|&s;ibility were &s;u&s;tained, before I advanced upon the thre&s;|hold of my proof, by the Lord Advocate's giving him up. Sorry am I indeed for the Pro&s;ecutor's timely precaution; proof was thickening fa&s;t again&s;t this gentleman; proof of practices, proof of crimes, which&mdash;but I go no far|ther; the day will come, when this gentlemen and my&s;elf &s;hall exchange &s;ituations at this bar. I tru&s;t that by your verdict I &s;hall be acquitted, and the moment after, I &s;o|lemnly pledge my&s;elf to this nation, to exhibit again&s;t him a criminal accu&s;ation of the mo&s;t &s;erious kind. To &s;ay more would not be right, as tending to excite a prejudice again&s;t him in the day of his own trial. It is &s;ufficient for me, that, even in this &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s, after the proof I was leading, my mo&s;t rancorous enemy, would have blu&s;hed to have brought forward this man's te&s;timony.</P>
<P>The next witne&s;s was, Henry Freeland, pre&s;ident of the &s;ociety, at Kirkintilloch. The indictment charges me with having convocated the &s;ocieties at Camp&s;ie and at Kirk|intilloch. The witne&s;s depones, that there was an inten|tion of having a &s;ociety at Kirkintilloch, long before ever he &s;aw me. Does this witne&s;s, the fir&s;t pre&s;ident of that &s;ociety who, if any man could, mu&s;t have been well in|formed of the circum&s;tances leading to its formation, &s;up|port the charge of the libel? Quite the rever&s;e. I &s;hall po&s;tpone the mo&s;t material part of his depo&s;ition to the la&s;t. In my &s;peech, he mentions, that I &s;poke about &s;hortening the duration of Parliaments and a more equal repre&s;enta|tion; that I &s;aid, that I thought taxes might be le&s;&s;ened by the&s;e means, and that the reform was not to take place as
<PB N="90" REF="027633_0090_0FD556C0A2783418">
to the King and Hou&s;e of Lords, but only of the Commons. Call you this &s;edition! Does not every thing brought for|ward by the&s;e witne&s;&s;es of the Crown, confute the fal&s;e, the injurious, and the &s;candalous charge in the libel, of vi|lifying the Con&s;titution, and of exciting the people to rebel|lion again&s;t the King?</P>
<P>Mr. Freeland &s;aid, that I mentioned the &s;ucce&s;s of the French arms, and that liberty would be e&s;tabli&s;hed in France. Call you this likewi&s;e a crime? At the time when I &s;poke was it not true? Were not the armies of France in every part victorious? and could I, not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power of pene|tration into the future, be &s;ure that they were not to ac|compli&s;h their object? Are not opinions, after all that has happened during the la&s;t months, as much divided as they were then? Can you go into private or into public com|pany, where this topic forms not the mo&s;t material part of their conver&s;ation? If merely to &s;peak upon this &s;ubject be &s;edition, you are all contaminated.</P>
<P>Mr. Freeland concurs with the other witne&s;&s;es in re|membering, that I recommended no other book to the meet|ing, than Henry's Hi&s;tory. That I told them all riot would be ruin to the cau&s;e; exhorted them to be con&s;titutional and regular, and told them, that they were to petition Parlia|ment, and that there was no other way of getting a reform.</P>
<P>I now come to the mo&s;t material part of Mr. Freeland's evidence, which relates to my lending him a copy of Paine's Works. Now let us take his evidence in the connection of time. He tells you, that, having heard that a proclamation was again&s;t that book, he was upon that account curious to &s;ee it, and that he <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;poke of it to me; that upon Tue&s;|day, eight days before the &s;ociety met, when I happened to be at Kirkintilloch, in the hou&s;e of Wallace, to which I had &s;ent for him, that I bid him &s;earch in my great coat pocket, and he would find the book; but that he had be|fore this time, for the rea&s;on which he had mentioned, a&s;k|ed the loan of it from me. He further tells you, that when he fir&s;t &s;poke of that book to me, I &s;aid, I thought it had a tendency to mi&s;lead the people; that he was &s;urpri&s;ed I did not recommend it, becau&s;e every body el&s;e &s;poke well of it, and that I did not approve of it.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="027633_0091_0FD523C4A41E8178">This is Mr. Freeland's depo&s;ition as to what pa&s;&s;ed be|tween him and me, when he received Mr. Paine's Works. But his te&s;timony goes farther, and corroborates that in which all the witne&s;&s;es are unanimous, concerning what pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ociety when that book was mentioned; of its being &s;ugge&s;ted by one Boyd, to purcha&s;e it; but that I &s;hook my head, and &s;aid it was foreign to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, This is the mo&s;t material evidence which the Pro&s;ecutor has been able to produce. A wide field is now before us, and that I may deviate as little as po&s;&s;ible from preci&s;ion, I &s;hall arrange what I have to &s;ay, under di|&s;tinct heads.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, the indictment charges me of feloni|ou&s;ly and wickedly circulating and di&s;tributing this book, in order to inflame the minds of men again&s;t the Con&s;titu|tion. You are the judges of the law and of the fact. Your deci&s;ion will not &s;eparate them from each other, but com|bine them both together. It is nece&s;&s;ary for me to inform you, that, without a criminal intention, there can be no crime; and has not the indictment it&s;elf &s;et forth, that I did not circulate the&s;e books merely, but that the circu|lation proceeded from &s;uch intention. Now, I a&s;k you to lay your hands upon your brea&s;ts, and to &s;ay, where, in the circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e, is the &s;hadow of felonious de&s;ign. The Works of Mr. Paine had been publi&s;hed and &s;old every where. The papers of the day teemed with &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive adverti&s;ements, announcing where they were to be procured. What excited this curio&s;ity in the public mind, without uttering a &s;ingle &s;yllable upon the intrin&s;ic merit or demerit of the&s;e works, is ea&s;y to tell. The &s;ituation of France rou&s;ed the attention of Europe. To that coun|try every eye was turned, and every man who could wield a pen, was employed in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the principles which the Revolution had brought forward. Mr. Burke entered the field of controver&s;y. The name of that gentleman would give &s;ale and diffu&s;ion to any production. Mr. Burke fought upon one &s;ide of the que&s;tion. He was encountered upon the oppo&s;ite by Thomas Paine. Both of them cham|pions of approved vigour, and of undoubted prowe&s;s. &mdash;Could public curio&s;ity not be awakened to the conten|tion

It was &s;o mo&s;t completely: and, the Works of Mr. Burke and of Thomas Paine, flew with a ra|pidity to every corner of the land, hitherto unexampled in the hi&s;tory of political &s;cience. Is there a &s;ingle man a|mong you, who has not read the Works either of Paine or of Burke? Is there a per&s;on upon the bench, upon the Ju|ry, or in this audience, who has either not purcha&s;ed or lent the Treati&s;e upon the Rights of Man! Now, if one of you lent to a friend or relation, who might participate in the common curio&s;ity, a &s;ingle pamphlet of Mr. Paine's, you are as guilty as I am; but why &s;hould I u&s;e the term guilty? NONE of us are guilty in lending that book, be|cau&s;e we harboured no evil de&s;ign.</P>
<P>If there had been a public law of the Kingdom condemn|ing that book, the pre&s;umption of ignorance, could not be admitted by its rigid rule. And the mere act of giving a|way a &s;ingle copy, would have been con&s;idered as a viola|tion of its letter. But, at the period when I lent Mr. Free|land Paine's Works, was the &s;entence of reprobation than|dered again&s;t them? No&mdash;I then was guilty of offending no exi&s;ting Law. I was not certified of my danger. I was not put upon my guard. Was there a judgment of any court in England or in Scotland again&s;t this book at that time? No&mdash;Then I had no cau&s;e for alarm; but &s;ome months before, a proclamation again&s;t &s;editious writings had been i&s;&s;ued. A proclamation, gentlemen, is not law. It can declare and it can enforce what the law has alrea|dy enacted, but it has no legi&s;lative authority. But was there any mention of Mr. Paine's Works in that procla|mation? None.&mdash;What were the con&s;equences of this proclamation? You know them well.&mdash;If there had been a demand before for political books, that demand in|crea&s;ed in a tenfold proportion. Concerning the par|ticular books to which the proclamation might be &s;up|po&s;ed to allude, curio&s;ity was more highly excited, and conver&s;ation became more keenly intere&s;ted. Now, mark the circum&s;tances, in which Mr. Freeland applied to me for the loan of that book. Here, take notice of his expre&s;s words, "that having heard a proclamation of the King was u&s;ed again&s;t it, he was, upon that account, curious to
<PB N="93" REF="027633_0093_0FD61926292B94D0">
&s;ee it, and fir&s;t &s;poke of it to Mr. Muir." Now I a&s;k you if any thing like felonious intention in Freeland can be di&s;|covered, in applying for it to me; a proclamation had been i&s;&s;ued again&s;t &s;editious books, and a natural curio&s;ity was excited in him to &s;ee what the&s;e books were, which he had heard reported to be &s;editious; a curio&s;ity which, at the time, was common to all. I a&s;k, if you could &s;uppo&s;e there was a felonious intention in my lending it? Did I introduce the conver&s;ation by &s;peaking of it. Did I advi&s;e him to read it, to adopt its principles, and to contribute his exertions to carry them into practice? No.&mdash;He expre&s;sly tells you, that I did not approve of the book; that I &s;aid it had a tendency to mi&s;lead the people, at which he was &s;urpri&s;ed, as it was otherwi&s;e approved by all. To what then reduces it&s;elf this mighty crime of &s;edition for which I &s;tand here? To gratify the natural curio&s;ity for a per&s;on who tells you, he lives in my neighbourhood, and is a di&s;tant re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ion; I lent a book, which was in univer&s;al circulation, unnoticed by Courts of Ju&s;tice, uncondemned by law.</P>
<P>If you have come here this day with an intention to bring me in guilty, whether right or wrong, &s;ay &s;o bold|ly, openly, and let me add, hone&s;tly. Re&s;ort not to wretched pretexts and expedients to ju&s;tify a &s;tretch of power. The&s;e pretexts are &s;oon &s;een through by the pe|netrating eye of mankind, and to the guilt attending the determination, will be added the contempt which the pre|text will ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, I would direct your at|tention to what Mr. Paine's writings are, and to the parti|cular manner in which they are pre&s;ented in accu&s;ation, in my trial. I will allow that any writing which calls upon the people to ri&s;e in arms, to re&s;i&s;t the law, and to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution is &s;omething wor&s;e than &s;editious, that it is trea&s;onable, but do the writings of Mr. Paine &s;tand in that predicament? Can you point me cut a &s;ingle &s;entence where he provokes in&s;urrection? Mr. Paine's writings are indi&s;putably of a &s;peculative nature. He inve&s;tigates the fir&s;t principles of &s;ociety; he compares different forms of government together; and where he gives the preference, he a&s;&s;igns his rea&s;ons for &s;o doing.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="027633_0094_0FD556C759E50B28">I have neither time, nor inclination to entertain you by di&s;&s;ertations upon the Liberty of the Pre&s;s.

<P>Con&s;titutions of government are the workman&s;hip of men; that con&s;titution is the mo&s;t perfect, which can be mo&s;t ea&s;ily amended. There are con&s;titutions, which, &s;tep by &s;tep, without convul&s;ion, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut blood, have ad|vanced to &s;uperior degrees of perfection; which, by their own internal energy, have effected their own reformation, and avoided the calamities of a revolution. The&s;e progre&s;|&s;ive con&s;titutions, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t always cheri&s;h and &s;upport the liberty of the pre&s;s, as the chief in|&s;trument of their pre&s;ervation. Look back, I be&s;eech you, to the ancient &s;y&s;tem in France. To you the ob&s;ervation may be &s;ingular, but I am confident in my own mind it is ju&s;t. If, while the ve&s;tiges of their ancient con&s;titution &s;till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emained, while the remembrance of the States General was not yet forgotten, the freedom of the pre&s;s had not been annihilated, their con&s;titution would have become pro|gre&s;&s;ive;
<PB N="95" REF="027633_0095_0FD556C8DA4CF4B8">
its reformation would gradually have been ope|rated, and by the exertions of good men and of patriotic writers, all the calamities which we now deplore in the re|volution would have been averted. How grateful &s;hould we be to eternal providence, that our Con&s;titution po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in it&s;elf the power of amendment, that, without a revolu|tion, it can rectify its abu&s;es; and that, &s;ilently and without di&s;order, it can advance towards that cha&s;tened liberty, which con&s;titutes human felicity. You have read the hi&s;tory of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution; and what is it but the hi&s;tory of a continual progre&s;s? You will next a&s;k what has been the impelling cau&s;e of this progre&s;s? I an&s;wer, the right of the univer&s;al diffu&s;ion of information, by means of the Liberty of the Pre&s;s. If you de&s;troy that liberty, you accompli&s;h one of two things.&mdash;The people will be buried in ignorance; the iron throne of de&s;poti&s;m will be erected, and the &s;ilent&mdash;I cannot, will not contemplate the picture. If you de&s;|troy the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, you may perchance do &s;ome|thing el&s;e, which is horrible to think upon. This high &s;pi|rited and generous people will not &s;oon forget their lo&s;t rights. You have removed what led to progre&s;&s;ive perfec|tion. Evil will proceed to evil. What originated &s;olely from corrupted men, will be imputed to the con&s;titution it|&s;elf. By undermining its be&s;t prop, its mo&s;t &s;olid and ma&s;|&s;y pillar, I repeat it, and never &s;hall cea&s;e to repeat it, the liberty of the Pre&s;s, you expo&s;e this holy fabric to a blow, which will &s;hake it from its foundations. Let us then ap|ply this argument to the ca&s;e of Mr. Paine. This work is merely of a &s;peculative nature, upon the principles of go|vernment. If Mr. Paine's Work is, incon&s;i&s;tent with the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, what is the con&s;equence? If the book is written with ingenuity, it will acquire readers. No man in his &s;ound &s;en&s;es, the keene&s;t advocate for a Parliament|ary Reform, but will avert his eyes, bathed in tears, and in horror of &s;oul, from a revolution. He will compare the principles of Mr. Paine with the Con&s;titution. If Mr. Paine has pointed out any thing defective in the Con&s;titu|tion, he will contribute his humble efforts to have that de|fect repaired. If, upon the other hand, he &s;hall imagine, that Mr. Paine has taken an erroneous view of this ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e,
<PB N="96" REF="027633_0096_0FD556CD0A4643A8">
has mi&s;repre&s;ented its properties, he will become more and more &s;en&s;ible, from his inquiry, of the &s;ecurity which he enjoys under its protecting roof. The &s;en&s;e of danger will be removed, and his mind, undi&s;turbed by gloomy appre|hen&s;ions, will enjoy tranquility. O! how little do ye deem the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, who think that it is built upon the &s;and, which when the rain de&s;cendeth, and the floods cometh, and the winds blow, and beat upon it, that it &s;hall fail. No&mdash;when the rains de&s;cend, when the floods come, when the winds blow, it &s;hall not fall, for it is founded upon a rock. I then maintain, although not in accents &s;weet to the ear of corruption, grateful to courtly pride, nor acceptable to ill-got power, that tho&s;e &s;peculative wri|ters, who inve&s;tigate the principles of our Con&s;titution, who compare that Con&s;titution with tho&s;e of other countries, perform a meritorious &s;ervice to this nation: the&s;e writers either impel us to rectify that which is wrong, or more &s;trongly confirm us in our love and in our attachment to that which is right. Let Mr. Paine then be con&s;idered as the bittere&s;t enemy to our Con&s;titution, yet as long as he confines him&s;elf to &s;peculation, we &s;hould be grateful. Our be&s;t intere&s;ts are involved in the Con&s;titution, and like tho&s;e &s;till of a higher cla&s;s, &s;uperior to time, and which ex|tend to eternity, are too apt to be forgotten, and to make little impre&s;&s;ion. If Mr. Paine then has called our atten|tion to the Con&s;titution, he has performed to us an e&s;&s;en|tial &s;ervice, he has led us to contemplate all its perfection, and rou&s;ed us from our lethargy to rectify wherever, by time and by corruption, it may have &s;uffered decay.</P>
<P>Shall the lending of a &s;ingle copy of the works of this writer be held criminal? When was there ever &s;uch a vi|olation of the rights of Britons? Mr. Paine has compo&s;ed no model of a perfect commonwealth, as Mr. Hume has done; yet, the political works of Mr. Hume, you have all read, and you have all applauded. If you condemn a man for lending Mr. Paine's Works, you do what even was not attempted to be done in the reign of Henry the VIII, when the Con&s;titution lay expiring on the rack of de&s;poti&s;m, making exertions, which only could di&s;cover re|maining life, but at the &s;ame time the privation of &s;trength.
<PB N="97" REF="027633_0097_0FD556CE19B826F8">
Along with equality of political rights, has Mr. Paine preached equality of property? a chimera which may enter into the brains of tho&s;e, who may dream of a golden age, but who know not human nature. Yet, under that arbitra|ry reign, did not Sir Thomas M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re, enjoying the confidence of the King, and placed at the head of the law, publi&s;h his Utopia, the plan of his republic, of which an equal divi|&s;ion of property, an Agrarian law, an univer&s;al community, formed the ba&s;is. In this enlightened age, when, after &s;o many fiery trials, our con&s;titution, in its pure and genuine principles, &s;tands unveiled to our view, will you condemn a man for lending a work, equally &s;peculative, and if &s;uch a thing exi&s;ted, as a well founded panic again&s;t levellers, in|finitely more dangerous.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be the la&s;t man to propo&s;e to your imitation, the conduct of de&s;pots; but I call upon you to ponder well the words of a man, who rendered the terms republic and pure and undefined de&s;poti&s;m the &s;ame; Cromwell. Under his pro|tector&s;hip, when Harrington publi&s;hed his Oceana; inform|ers denounced the work. "My cau&s;e is too &s;trong." &s;aid Cromwell, "to be hurt by paper &s;hot;" and if you &s;ay that, by any publication, the Briti&s;h con&s;titution can be injured, you your&s;elves are guilty of the crime of libelling its &s;trength.</P>
<P>To conclude upon this head, I maintain, that to &s;uppre&s;s works purely &s;peculative, provoking not the people to di&s;|obedience to the laws, nor to rebellion, however much the&s;e works may differ from the con&s;titution, is to de|&s;troy the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, to trample upon the be&s;t and the &s;ure&s;t bulwark, which defends the approach|es to that re&s;pected building. If, to lend the Works of Thomas Paine to-day be &s;edition, to lend a tran&s;|lation of the republic of Plato to-morrow will be trea&s;on. Gentlemen, the Works of Mr. Paine are lying before me. I could read to you many pa&s;&s;ages to prove, that they are merely of a &s;peculative nature. You are exhau&s;ted; e|qually &s;o am I. And yet, we have &s;ome length of field before we conlude to travel over.

tru&s;t that you will now be per&s;uaded, that neither the pub|li&s;hing nor the lending of a &s;peculative political book is &s;e|dition. But I now call your attention to another circum|&s;tance, the manner in which criminality is attached to that book and to my&s;elf. Various detached pa&s;&s;ages are quoted from it in the indictment. They are called wicked, inflam|matory and &s;editious. In the &s;acred name of ju&s;tice, will you condemn any book for detached pa&s;&s;ages, &s;eparated from the whole connection, cut off from reciprocal explanation, and from which neither its general tenor nor &s;cope can be di&s;covered. If you do this, where is the book in which you cannot di&s;cover &s;edition, by di&s;&s;ecting its &s;eparate &s;en|tences and paragraphs. For my part, if you proceed on in this manner, I do not know a more dangerous collection than the books of holy in&s;piration. Separate ver&s;e from ver&s;e, and then combine them, according to your plea&s;ure, and you may make the Bible one of the mo&s;t &s;editious and trea&s;onable books which ever was written. But you are neither to condemn that book, nor me, for tho&s;e detached pa&s;&s;ages exhibited in the indictment. You mu&s;t carry along with you the whole works of Mr. Paine, you mu&s;t &s;cruti|nize line by line, and you mu&s;t pronounce upon the gene|ral context. If you find it provoking the people to re&s;i&s;|tance, calling them forth to arms, to &s;ubvert the con&s;titu|tion; then, no doubt, it is &s;editious. But, if you find the author indulging him&s;elf in nothing but philo&s;ophical and political &s;peculation, however much your principles and his may differ, you cannot condemn him for compo&s;ing it, or me, after it was compo&s;ed and publi&s;hed, for lending it to a relation.</P>
<P>If you condemn books for being &s;editious, upon account of pa&s;&s;ages culled from this page and from that page, and artfully combined together, you have it in your power to award a pro&s;cription again&s;t books and univer&s;al literature. As I have already mentioned, there is not a &s;ingle book, in which, by di&s;&s;ecting it in this manner, &s;entence by &s;entence, and pa&s;&s;age by pa&s;&s;age, you may not di&s;cover immorality, bla&s;phemy, and trea&s;on. Indeed, if the &s;ad objects of re|flection which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to my mind, when I con|template the &s;tate of my country, could permit me to in|dulge

If there are &s;entiments in the Works of Mr. Paine, (and many &s;uch there are) fraught with univer&s;al benevolence, inculcating univer&s;al amity and brotherhood, and of a tendency to di&s;|pel tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and tho&s;e prejudices, which animate and impel nation again&s;t nation into the field of blood and of car|nage, I am entitled to plead upon the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages: I have a right to &s;ay, that it was the antidote and not the poi&s;on I recommended; And you mu&s;t know, that the law of this country obliges you, where oppo&s;ing pre&s;umptions are of equal &s;trength, to let the balance preponderate on the &s;ide of mercy.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;hall conclude upon the &s;ubject of Mr. Paine's Works by ob&s;erving, That all the witne&s;&s;es have u|niformly &s;worn, that I refu&s;ed to recommend them; that when the matter was propo&s;ed, I &s;aid, the principles con|tained in them might mi&s;lead the people, as they were fo|reign to the object of the &s;ociety, and might mi&s;guide weak minds. There is not a witne&s;s adduced by the Pro&s;ecutor, who &s;ays the contrary of this; and will you agree in opi|nion, that the charge in my indictment of circulating and recommending the&s;e books, has the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lighte&s;t &s;hadow of &s;up|port? I will tell you the rea&s;on why I did not recommend Mr. Paine's books to the &s;ocieties Scotland, and why I declared them foreign to their purpo&s;e&mdash;Mr. Paine is a re|publican, and the &s;pirit of republicanis;m breathes through
<PB N="100" REF="027633_0100_0FD55707DB9EF410">
all his writings. This is his darling &s;y&s;tem. The object of the&s;e &s;ocieties was, by con&s;titutional means, to procure a reformation in the con&s;titution, and not a revolution, which implied its de&s;truction; to have their long lo&s;t rights re&s;tored, but not the a&s;&s;umption of new rights derived from a different &s;y&s;tem. The people of Scotland were rapidly advancing to a true &s;en&s;e of their con&s;titutional liberties: They demanded an application to them of the con&s;titution, in its genuine principles, in which they beheld their &s;ecu|rity confirmed, and their happine&s;s e&s;tabli&s;hed. That they might advance with more ardour in this cau&s;e, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould know the con&s;titution; what it had been in its vigour, and what it now is in its decay, in con|&s;equence of the corruption of men and of ages. What did I do to effectuate this legal and peaceable object? I did not pre&s;ent to them the &s;plendid fabrics of ancient or of modern republics; I wi&s;hed them to keep their eyes confined at home, to repair their own man&s;ion rather than pull it down, and expo&s;e them&s;elves to the inconveniencies and to the dangers of building upon new plans, the advantages or di&s;advantages of which could be only known by the uncer|tain experience of future ages. All the witne&s;&s;es who &s;peak of my conduct in the &s;ocieties tell you, that I recommend|ed none but cun&s;titutional mea&s;ures; and that the only book which I recommended to them was Henry's Hi&s;tory of England, as the be&s;t calculated, by its accuracy and plainne&s;s, to give them in&s;ight into the nature and progre&s;s of their con&s;titution.</P>
<P>If, in my library, in conver&s;ation upon the &s;ubject of go|vernment, the plans adopted by different political writers had been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, doubtle&s;s, I might have given opinions different from tho&s;e which I con&s;idered it my duty to advance when acting under an e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution, and employ|ed in tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which it pointed out, to effectuate a redre&s;s of grievances. When Mr. Hume publi&s;hed his E&s;|&s;ay upon a Perfect Commonwealth, did not he, as &s;trongly as he po&s;&s;ibly could, declare that he thought this model preferable to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, even in its pure&s;t and be&s;t principles? But &s;uppo&s;ing Mr. Hume to have been a member of the Society of the Friends of the People, what
<PB N="101" REF="027633_0101_0FD523CE371ACBD8">
would have been his conduct in it? Would he have &s;aid to men who were a&s;&s;embled to renovate con&s;titutional rights only, You mu&s;t give up the con&s;titution entirely; it is de|fective and imperfect when compared to the offspring of my fancy; it is this la&s;t which you mu&s;t adopt, and reject the former. But Mr. Hume would have held forth no &s;uch language; he would have &s;aid to them, 'The grievances of which you complain can be redre&s;&s;ed by the energy of our own con&s;titution; the redre&s;s of the&s;e grievances is the on|ly object of your a&s;&s;ociation. If then reformation is your object, and not revolution, however much you may ap|prove of my &s;peculative &s;y&s;tem, it mu&s;t not operate upon you for a moment in practice.'</P>
<P>It was upon this principle that I refu&s;ed to recommend the Works of Mr. Paine; that I &s;aid, that they were foreign to the purpo&s;e, and might mi&s;lead weak minds. But was it ever before held criminal in an author, to publi&s;h what &s;peculative &s;y&s;tems of government he plea&s;ed, provided he confined him&s;elf in the retirement of &s;peculation, and did not advance forth to the field of action? Was it a crime of Plato, under the Athenian republic, to compo&s;e his beau|tiful &s;y&s;tem, of one more perfect? Was it high trea&s;on in Cicero, under the Roman Commonwealth, to write tho&s;e applauded works, which have been lo&s;t in the darkne&s;s of the Gothic night, and of which, a few fragments could be found only, when the morning of letters began to dawn upon Europe? Was Sir Thomas More led forth to the &s;caf|fold for compo&s;ing his Utopia, Harrington pro&s;cribed for his Oceana, or Hume exiled for his Commonwealth? The&s;e authors indulged them&s;elves in a liberty, which, if we now are to be deprived of, we mu&s;t be left hopele&s;s, and in di&s;|pair, as the attempt at amendment and reformation will be for ever precluded.</P>
<P>Upon the principle which I have explained, I &s;hould have thought it equally, if not more dangerous uad inex|pedient, to have recommended in a Society of the Friends of the People, Plato's Republic, or Hume's Commonwealth.

and to fervid imaginations, they might have influenced them to depart from tho&s;e ends, which, by calmne&s;s, per&s;everance, and legal mea&s;ures, they were &s;ure at la&s;t to accompli&s;h, in pur&s;uit of chimeras, brilliant but delu&s;ive, always &s;eeming|ly approaching, but always in reality flying farther away.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I conclude my ob&s;ervations upon the &s;ub|ject of Mr. Paine's Works. You will remember it was on|ly a &s;ingle copy which I lent; the circum&s;tances attending it, which, admitting the book to be as &s;editious and as trea|&s;onable as can be imagined, precluded the idea of a felo|nious circulation. You are the fir&s;t Jury in Scotland, before whom Mr. Paine was either directly or indirectly brought; I tru&s;t, that you will act in &s;uch a manner as to do honour to your&s;elves, in doing ju&s;tice to him and to me; that you will not attempt to annihilate political &s;cience, by condemning a work in its nature purely &s;peculative; that, in this country where our chief glory has ari&s;en from literature, you will not limit her re&s;earches, but indulge her in her unbounded flight, into every region where the materials of human happine&s;s and human improvement can be collected. Above all I entreat you, that you would not &s;et the dangerous precedent of condemning a book, for &s;entences detached from the whole, when you do not con&s;ider the general tenor and &s;cope. I tell you that if you do not carry away this book from your table to your chamber, read every line, and compare the whole in con|nection, you do me mo&s;t flagrant inju&s;tice. <HI>Finally,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you, that you are not bound by what any Jury has done in England&mdash;you are bound by the Law of Scotland; and this is the fir&s;t trial of the kind which ever occurred here:&mdash;Even the deci&s;ions in England have lo&s;t the re&s;|pect due to them, although they were to be held out as precedents. We have &s;een Juries one day condemning the author and the publi&s;hers, and upon the &s;ucceeding day we have heard other Juries pronounce a verdict of acquittal.</P>
<P>The next witne&s;s is Anne Fi&s;her, a late &s;ervant in my father's hou&s;e. Her evidence comes forward to you with peculiar di&s;tinction; care&s;&s;ed by the Pro&s;ecutor, and com|plimented by the Court;&mdash;her wonderful accuracy extol|led, and her abilities admired. I will &s;oon &s;hew you, Gen|tlemen,

that &s;he has but few preten&s;ions to that accuracy, of which the Lord Advocate &s;poke in &s;uch terms;&mdash;that her memory po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;ingular quality, retentive to whatever may militate again&s;t me, but he&s;itating and confu&s;ed to whatever may &s;eem in my favour What this dome&s;tic and well in&s;tructed &s;py has given in evidence again&s;t me, fills my mind with little concern; on the contrary it af|fords me much &s;atisfaction to find that when I was &s;ur|rounded in the place where I expected mo&s;t &s;ecurity,&mdash; where all &s;u&s;picion was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lled a&s;leep, my conduct was &s;o guarded.&mdash;What do I &s;ay?&mdash;Guarded! Innocence has no need to be on the watch.</P>
<P>My conduct has been &s;uch, as even malice it&s;elf cannot condemn. But before I proceed to read her evidence from my notes, let me &s;olemnly caution you again&s;t the danger|ous precedent of giving credibility to witne&s;&s;es of this kind, under accu&s;ations of this nature. The crime of &s;e|dition, if you attend to its e&s;&s;ence, never can be committed within the walls of a private hou&s;e. It &s;uppo&s;es the high|e&s;t publicity, the convocation of many. But if power &s;hall &s;ay, that words &s;poken in an unguarded moment within the &s;acred walls of a family, amount to this crime, What will follow? Not <HI>tho&s;e</HI> with whom you may have acted in your political life, and who, with the impre&s;&s;ion of the oath of God upon them, can be&s;t tell the truth; not <HI>tho&s;e</HI> whom you may have admitted to your friend&s;hip, and to your confidence, and who be&s;t know the &s;ecrets of your &s;oul; but the meane&s;t of your dome&s;tics, who could hardly approach your pre&s;ence even in their menial duties, who, (if the expre&s;&s;ion may be u&s;ed) to the members of a fami|ly are almo&s;t unknown;&mdash;The&s;e! The&s;e!

O! Beware how ye &s;anctify the &s;hameful proceeding. It is not me you wound alone, but you de&s;troy the confidence which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between man and man; you lead, by your own hands, to the fire-&s;ides of your children and your deare&s;t rela|tions, the fiends of &s;u&s;picion and of danger; and ye forever

<P><HI>[Here Mr. Muir read from his notes, the evidence of Anne Fi&s;her.]</HI></P>
<P>The te&s;timony of this witne&s;s &s;eems to relate to two of the principal charges in the indictment; the fir&s;t, to my ha|ving made &s;peeches in public &s;ocieties, vilifying the King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd con&s;titution. The &s;econd, to my having di&s;tributed and recommended &s;editious books, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. Paine, the Patriot, the Pai&s;ley Declaration, and the Dialogue between the Go|vernors and the Governed. Under the&s;e two different arti|cles, let us examine the te&s;timony of this witne&s;s. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To my making &s;editious &s;peeches; <HI>Secondly,</HI> To my circu|lating &s;editious books.</P>
<P>Every thing which the Pro&s;ecutor could adduce again&s;t me, he has told you that he would adduce under the <HI>gene|rality</HI> of the term Sedition, even although it &s;hould not be &s;pecified in the libel. The Court likewi&s;e has permitted him &s;o to do; and in the ca&s;e of this witne&s;s, you can &s;ee an ex|emplary illu&s;tration of this right, if it can be &s;o called. Ac|cu&s;ed of making &s;editious harangues in public, this wretch|ed girl is adduced to &s;wear to what &s;he &s;ays, &s;he may have heard in private, when in&s;tructed to take her watch, &s;he &s;tood and marked to de&s;truction tho&s;e who fed her.</P>
<P>And what is the dreadful language &s;he has heard me u&s;e in my unguarded moments.

Members of Parliament to have thirty or for|ty &s;hillings a-day for their attendance&mdash;to be hone&s;t men and, to keep the con&s;titution clear! Is not this evidence, that he means to introduce in place of our Hou&s;e of Commons a Na|tional Convention, on French principles, and according to French forms"</P>
<P>Sorry am I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o record the ignorance of this Lord Advo|cate of Scotland. Is there a man who has hardly opened the volume of the hi&s;tory of our con&s;titution, who does not know, that until a very late period indeed, when corrup|tion glided in, and tainted and poi&s;oned the whole, mem|bers of Parliament received their wages from the hands of the people alone: O! how I &s;peak it with joy when I view the pa&s;t; with &s;orrow, when I contemplate the pre&s;ent; they would have &s;corned to have received the price of their attendance from any other hands, than from the hands of the people. Then the con&s;titution po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all its e|nergies. Then toward the con&s;titution in the &s;trength of age, but with the bloom of youth. The people delegated none, but men who&s;e virtues they knew, and none but men who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed public virtues could be found to under|take the important mi&s;&s;ion. Look back I entreat you to all the great and good men whom Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory records. Turn your eyes to the Hampdens, to the Sidneys, to the Marville's of former times; to tho&s;e men whom&mdash;but I &s;top; they received their wages directly from the people. Let the Lord Advocate pronounce their eulogium by his invective. If what I have &s;aid be &s;edition, when over|heard by that &s;py Fi&s;her, I &s;hall next moment render my|&s;elf infinitely more criminal; for I declare to you, that we never can expect a virtuous Hou&s;e of Commons a <HI>Con&s;titu|tional</HI> Hou&s;e of Commons, a Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;uch as it once was, connected with no other intere&s;t than the intere&s;t of the people; until &s;uch time as its members &s;hall receive a compen&s;ation for their attendance from the people and from no other quarter, be entitled to no other reward than the approbation of their own minds, and the applau&s;es of

their fellow-citizens, of who&s;e rights, and of who&s;e liberties, they have been the undaunted, uncorrupted defenders.</P>
<P>Fi&s;her proceeds to &s;tate, that &s;he has heard me &s;ay, That France was the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing nation in the world, as they had aboli&s;hed tyranny, and got a free government; And that, further, &s;e has heard me &s;ay, that the Con&s;titution or this country was very good; but that many abu&s;es had crept in, which required a thorough Reform.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, even in my mo&s;t unguarded hours, this do|me&s;tic &s;py cannot, by her evidence, &s;upport a tittle of the indictment, where it charges me with vilifying the King and Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Of her idle &s;tory of what I &s;aid concerning Courts of Ju&s;tice, that they need a reform, and that this Court in particular got their money for nothing, but pronouncing &s;entence of death upon poor creatures; and that their parade in coming into Gla&s;gow was u&s;ele&s;s, I di&s;dain to take no|tice Only, you will di&s;cover her exqui&s;ite art. This day, I am tried before this very Court, and &s;he &s;uppo&s;es, that, by inventing and throwing in a circum&s;tance of this kind, in order to irritate the judges again&s;t me, &s;he will more completely execute the wretched job &s;he has undertaken to perform. Were there not more &s;ervants in the hou&s;e, who had infinitely better opportunities to hear my conver&s;ation; and mu&s;t &s;he, the lowe&s;t of them all, with whom &s;he can|not pretend I had ever two minutes conver&s;ation, be &s;ingled out, and pitched upon for this drudgery?</P>
<P>This witne&s;s depones, that &s;he heard me &s;ay, a republi|can form of government was the be&s;t, but a monarchical form of government, under proper re&s;trictions, would be the be&s;t in this country. With all her art, and with all her memory, &s;he cannot depone to a &s;ingle circum&s;tance which can &s;trike again&s;t me. Even from her own account of my private conver&s;ation, it appears, that when I &s;poke of re|publican forms of government, it was purely in the ab&s;tract, without any allu&s;ion to this country, without expre&s;&s;ing any wi&s;h to &s;ee any particular mode of them introduced; and that when I &s;poke of this country, I never deviated from the con&s;titution, but &s;aid that a limited monarchy, under re&s;trictions, was the be&s;t adapted to its intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="027633_0107_0FD556D96C118268">The next article of &s;edition to which &s;he depones, is of the mo&s;t extraordinary kind, that I had &s;ent her to employ an organi&s;t on the &s;treets of Gla&s;gow, to play the French tune of <HI>Ca Ira.</HI> What! was a tune, unintelligible to the multitude, to light up the flames of civil di&s;cord, and to be the forerunner of the revolution? Have you read the words of that popular &s;ong? Could you di&s;cover a &s;ingle allu&s;ion in them to the &s;tate of England? But &s;uppo&s;ing you did, there is a pre&s;umption from your &s;tation in life, that you are acquainted with the French language; but is it &s;o with the multitude of our weavers in that quarter of the coun|try? Britain has always cheri&s;hed freedom, and &s;hall it be deemed criminal in me to li&s;ten to the effu&s;ions of joy, poured out by a neighbouring people, on obtaining that fir&s;t of human ble&s;&s;ings, which always con&s;tituted our peculiar di&s;tinction? But I know it well. The word <HI>Freedom</HI> is &s;oon to be pro&s;cribed from our language; it carries alarm and &s;edition in the &s;ound. If I had cau&s;ed to be recited one of tho&s;e noble choru&s;es of the Grecian drama, in which, with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of liberty, the glories of the Republics of Athens or of Sparta were di&s;played, in language more than mortal, my offence would have been deemed the &s;ame with that of amu&s;ing my&s;elf, by hearing the national &s;ong of France. If it had been po&s;&s;ible for me to have cau&s;ed to be &s;ung, upon the Streets of Gla&s;gow, one of the P&s;alms of the Hebrews, in the original language, in which the tri|umphs of the people and the de&s;truction of tyrants are re|corded in a &s;train of the highe&s;t poetical in&s;piration, the criminality would have been the &s;ame with that of li&s;tening to <HI>ca ira.</HI></P>
<P>Let me abandon the &s;ubject. My political career has neither been ob&s;cure nor inglorious. It has undergone the &s;evere&s;t &s;crutiny which ever fell to the lot of man; and af|ter every engine has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en employed, after heaven and earth have been-moved, the tremendous charge of &s;edition is to be &s;upported by the te&s;timonies of dome&s;tic &s;pies, &s;wearing, not to my &s;erious occupation, but to the amu&s;ement of an idle hour, in li&s;tening to a foreign tune.</P>
<P>Let us next attend to the evidence of Fi&s;her, as far as it relates to &s;editious publications. She &s;wears that I u&s;ed
<PB N="108" REF="027633_0108_0FD619FCFA0B92C8">
to recommend to a great many country people who came to my father's &s;hop to purcha&s;e and to read the works of Mr. Paine, as they compo&s;ed a very good book. How can you believe the general averment? In the number of country people, &s;he can only &s;pecify one; John Barclay, and when you come to his evidence, you will &s;ee that he gives her the flatte&s;t contradiction. She depones, that &s;he has bought, at two different times, for my uncle Alexander Muir, at my de&s;ire, a copy of the fir&s;t part, and a copy of the &s;econd part of the Rights of Man. Can you &s;uppo&s;e, that if my in|tentions had been felonious, I would have introduced &s;uch writings into my own family? Can you imagine that I could have wi&s;hed to involve, in the conflagration of my country, my neare&s;t relations to who&s;e property I may eventually &s;uc|ceed? Why is not Alexander Muir brought forward as a wit|ne&s;s? Certain it is, that he was clo&s;ely interrogated, before the inqui&s;ition held by Mr. Sheriff Honeyman. But the Lord Advocate &s;ays, that his feelings would not permit him to examine the uncle again&s;t the nephew. Wonderful huma|nity! Goodne&s;s ever to be remembered and extolled! But did not you, Sir, advi&s;e and direct the whole proceedings a|gain&s;t me; and will you have the effrontery to maintain that Alexander Muir was not dragged like a felon from his own home, by the myrmidons of power, carried before your friend Honeyman, and that every art was employed to wring from him every dome&s;tic &s;ecret?</P>
<P>Speak then to us of your humanity&mdash;continue to &s;peak to us of your feelings!</P>
<P>Fi&s;her next depones, that I much pre&s;&s;ed John Muir to purcha&s;e Paine's works, that he was prevailed upon, and that &s;he was &s;ent accordingly to purcha&s;e them. Now you will hear the evidence of this man, immediately in expre&s;s contradiction to this witne&s;s. She next tells you, that I ad|vi&s;ed another dome&s;tic, Wil&s;on my hair dre&s;&s;er, to purcha&s;e Paine's works and keep them in his &s;hop, in order to en|lighten the people, and you will hear Wil&s;on immediately expre&s;s him&s;elf far otherwi&s;e. She &s;peaks of carrying &s;ome paper, which &s;he thinks was a Declaration of Rights, to a Printing Office to be corrected.

If they are ex|ten&s;ive, as you have heard mine is, there is no crime in the whole catalogue, of which, by the te&s;timony of your own &s;ervants, you may not be found guilty. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Plato, of Harrington, or of Hume, will mark you down for republicans. The misfortune of having the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n of Ma|homet, will cau&s;e the &s;hipwreck of your faith, and &s;tigma|tize you as the di&s;ciples of the conqueror of Mecca. Well do I congratulate the Lord Advocate of Scotland.&mdash;He has di&s;covered a new region in the &s;phere of criminality.&mdash;He will not merely confine him&s;elf to a voyage of di&s;covery; But, along with his a&s;&s;ociates, he will make many voyages to this fertile land, and return home, loaded with many va|luable cargoes. But &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s becomes this place. Can it be believed, that in the clo&s;e of the eighteenth century, that this night the &s;ervants of a man &s;hould be examined concerning what particular books he may have had in his hou&s;e; and that the proof of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of particular books may ruin his reputation; &s;weep away his property; and deprive him of his life!</P>
<P>Let us proceed with this witne&s;s. If you po&s;&s;e&s;s the common feelings of men, every &s;entiment of indignation

<P>The libel charges me with feloniou&s;ly circulating a Dia|logue betwixt the Governors and the Governed, extracted from the ruins of Volney. This dialogue is narrated in the indictment, and it is charged to be felonious and &s;editious. There is not a word in this dialogue which is not true. A|las! in colours but too faithful, it delineates the mournful hi&s;tory of &s;ix thou&s;and years;&mdash;the crimes of de&s;pots, and the artifices of impo&s;tors, to &s;ubjugate, and to blind the peo|ple. It is purely ab&s;tracted. It is entirely &s;peculative. To no particular nation, much le&s;s to England, does it allude; if to any, it mu&s;t be to France, under the ancient &s;y&s;tem. Yet, this dialogue is libelled as &s;editious and inflammatory. The truth is, the crime of &s;edition <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be brought home again&s;t me; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any book, as well as that of Volney, mu&s;t be employed to &s;ub&s;tantiate it. Let us hear what the witne&s;s &s;ays concerning the felonious circula|tion. She heard me read it in the pre&s;ence of my mother, &s;i&s;ter, and &s;ome other people; that I &s;aid it was very clever, and done by <HI>Velnew,</HI> one of the fir&s;t wits in France. Who were tho&s;e other people who were in company with my mother and &s;i&s;ter when I read it? Her accuracy, &s;o much extolled by the Court, totally fails her. But the propaga|tion of &s;edition mu&s;t not be confined to a mother and a &s;i&s;|ter; it mu&s;t have a wider range;&mdash;<HI>other people pre&s;ent!</HI> and founding upon his beloved <HI>generality,</HI> the pro&s;ecutor has rea|&s;on to argue, there might have been a full company, a nu|merous meeting&mdash;nay,&mdash;an immen&s;e congregation.</P>
<P>You have heard the te&s;timony of Fi&s;her, and the&s;e are the arts; and of this cla&s;s are the witne&s;&s;es by which I am to fall. By receiving &s;uch te&s;timony, you forever de&s;troy dome&s;tic &s;ociety; you bla&s;t the blo&s;&s;oms of family confidence; you tender ALL &s;u&s;picious of ALL; each relation, to behold in each, a deadly foe.&mdash;And is it not &s;ufficient to weep over public calamities, that wide-&s;preading de&s;olation which, <HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> pa&s;&s;es over the nations; but when we retire to our own homes, we mu&s;t be obliged to confine our&s;elves in a di&s;|mal

<P>The next is the evidence of Thomas Wil&s;on, my hair|dre&s;&s;er, and he is brought to bring up the rear of Fi&s;her's te&s;timony. He depones, That I a&s;ked him if he had bought Paine's Works, and that I advi&s;ed him to get a copy of them, as a barber's &s;hop was a good place to read in. Does this confirm the te&s;timony of Fi&s;her, who &s;ays, I de&s;ired him to buy that Work, and to keep it in his &s;hop, in order to enlighten the people. Mark the art of Fi&s;her. How &s;trongly &s;he paints what might &s;eem to &s;trike again&s;t me.&mdash;<HI>To enlighten the people!</HI> But does Wil&s;on concur in this? No.&mdash;Wil&s;on!&mdash;the per&s;on who &s;hould have be&s;t remem|bered&mdash;the per&s;on to whom the words were addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Wil&s;on tells you, that he bought a copy of the Addre&s;s to the Addre&s;&s;ers; but that was not by my advice. He even recollects the <HI>levity</HI> of conver&s;ation. An old man, from the country, came in while he was dre&s;&s;ing me; he remem|bers me &s;aying, that this old man was a great reformer. If I ever &s;aid &s;o, I wi&s;h it may not have been in je&s;t, but in earne&s;t; and that the fact, with regard to the man, was true. For I know of none who &s;hould be greater reformers, of them&s;elves and of others, than tho&s;e who are &s;tanding on the brink of the grave, and panting upon eternity. But I am afraid that this witne&s;s remembers only a piece of unmeaning gai|ety. For he adds, the old man &s;aid I was only <HI>taunting him.</HI></P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of the evidence of Wil&s;on, affords me high con&s;olation. It is a proof of the innocency of my pri|vate life, in moments when I could not po&s;&s;ibly think of the affectation of integrity. He &s;wears, that he has always heard me &s;ay, that I would maintain the Con&s;titution; and that I wi&s;hed for peace, and good order, and good morals a|mong the people; and that he never heard me &s;peak again&s;t the King.</P>
<P>The next te&s;timony is that of John Muir. He tells you that he had a conver&s;ation with me in September la&s;t, about
<PB N="112" REF="027633_0112_0FD556E0DDF4BB50">
Paine's book, in my father's hou&s;e; that he a&s;ked the loan of it from me; that I told him I had it not. Does this re&s;emble the conduct of a man accu&s;ed of di|&s;tributing the&s;e books to all and &s;undry, and &s;cattering them over every portion of the land? He &s;ays, I mention|ed that I would &s;end a &s;ervant who would get it for him; that a &s;ervant girl accordingly went and got it. Does not this completely confute the te&s;timony of Fi&s;her, who affirms, that I much pre&s;&s;ed this man to buy the book? and, he tells you, that he him&s;elf a&s;ked the loan of it.</P>
<P>Is not this a complete contradiction of her te&s;timony?</P>
<P>The next witne&s;s is John Barclay. That old and vene|rable per&s;on, whom you &s;aw adduced as a witne&s;s by the Pro&s;ecutor; and what does he &s;ay in his te&s;timony? That we were elders in the &s;ame pari&s;h; the pari&s;h of Calder, in which the lands of my father are &s;ituated. He informs you that at the la&s;t election of a mini&s;ter for that pari&s;h, a di&s;|pute had ari&s;en, concerning the right of election, and that he voted upon the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion with my&s;elf. This introduced acquaintance, and acquaintance produced friend&s;hip. The Lord Advocate, in &s;peaking of this vir|tuous and venerable old man, exclaimed with in&s;olent con|tempt, Such men as <HI>the&s;e</HI> are the companions, and &s;uch men as <HI>the&s;e</HI> are the friends of Mr. Muir! Yes, I tell the Lord Advocate, I tell the ari&s;tocracy of Scotland, I glory more in the friend&s;hip of &s;uch an old, poor, and virtuous man, than in the friend&s;hip of the highe&s;t titled peer, who derives the &s;ources of his guilty grandeur from the cala|mities of the people; who wrings out a &s;plendid, but a mi&s;erable revenue from their &s;orrow and di&s;tre&s;s, from their tears, and from their blood, which he &s;quanders in di&s;&s;ipation, to the ruin of private virtue, and to the conta|mination of public morals.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee then what Mr. Barclay &s;ays again&s;t me. That he a&s;ked my opinion concerning Paine's books; and that I told him he might purcha&s;e them if he cho&s;e, as they were printed: but that I afterwards &s;aid, it was not a book for us. Does Mr. Barclay's evidence &s;upport the criminal charge in the libel, of my advi&s;ing people to read &s;editi|ous books, and of my circulating them over the country?

Does not Mr. Barclay's evidence corrobo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">te the te&s;timony of every other witne&s;s? That for the rea&s;ons which I ful|ly explained, I never recommended, Mr. Paine's works; but that even when that work excited the greate&s;t attention of the country; when mention of it was introduced into every company, and into every conver&s;ation, I uniformly expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, that it was not a book for our purpo&s;e.&mdash;<HI>For our purpo&s;e,</HI> who were engaged in the cau&s;e of a Par|liamentary and con&s;titutional Reform! Is there a &s;ingle witne&s;s brought forward by the Pro&s;ecutor, who has, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, &s;tated any conver&s;ation of mine which was uncon&s;titutional? Hear what Mr. Barclay &s;ays, that he was frequently with Mr. Muir, and in his library, from which he borrowed &s;ome books; that he had many conver|&s;ations with him, and heard him &s;ay, that the con&s;titution of this country was an excellent one; that he prai&s;ed the King; and that he always &s;poke of order, regularity, and obedience to the ruling powers. In &s;hort, Gentlemen, all and each of the witne&s;&s;es for the Pro&s;ecutor, u&s;e the &s;ame u|niform language, atte&s;t that neither in public nor in pri|vate, ever a &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion dropped from me, which the mo&s;t <HI>violent a&s;&s;ociator</HI> could con&s;true into guilt.</P>
<P>The la&s;t witne&s;s of whom I &s;hall take notice, is William Muir; the per&s;on who&s;e religious principles at fir&s;t indu|ced him rather to &s;uffer, according to the elegant expre&s;&s;ion of the Lord Advocate, <HI>eternal</HI> impri&s;onment than to take the oath, until his &s;cruples were removed by the Rev. Mr. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n. He &s;wears, that in my father's hou&s;e, at Hunter&s;hill, I gave him eleven numbers of the Patriot, and a copy of the Poli|tical Progre&s;s. From the&s;e numbers of the Patriot &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages are quoted in the indictment. Of the Political Pro|gre&s;s there is no mention made; and, I maintain, that eve|ry pa&s;&s;age in the Patriot, quoted in the libel, is highly con|&s;titutional. The &s;entiments advanced in them may not found mu&s;ically &s;weet to the ears of corruption. They call upon you to ari&s;e and vindicate the purity of your con&s;ti|tution. To vindicate your long lo&s;t rights; and, if my fee|ble voice could extend to the remote&s;t corners of Scotland, I &s;hould re&s;ound the &s;ame &s;entiment, in the &s;ame language.

Parliaments. And, I &s;ay to you, that the act which converted triennial Parliaments into &s;eptennial, violated our holy con&s;titution; tore the chartar of our national li|berties, and paved the way for the inroads of a frightful de&s;|poti&s;m.</P>
<P>But this witne&s;e concurs with all the preceding witne&s;&s;es, with regard to my conduct, and to my principles. He &s;wears, That he does not remember to have heard me &s;peak again&s;t government; that I did not advi&s;e uncon&s;titutional mea&s;ures; and that he heard me tell, how Old Sarum was repre&s;ented. Old Sarum repre&s;ented! And, do not the friends of the Con&s;titution weep! and do not the enemies of the Con&s;titution &s;mile, when they hear of &s;uch repre&s;en|tation.</P>
<P>Before I &s;peak to the third article of accu&s;ation, the read|ing, in the Convention, the Addre&s;s of the Society of Unit|ed Iri&s;hmen of Dublin, permit me to make one ob&s;ervation on the manner in which the Pro&s;ecutor &s;poke of the papers found in my cu&s;tody. Do they corre&s;pond with the view which he repre&s;ented of them? Are they the documents of corre&s;pondence with foreign or internal foes? And, &s;up|po&s;ing I had involved my&s;elf in a corre&s;pondence of that nature, do you believe I could be &s;o infatuated as to retain, in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that which mu&s;t have been attended with, to me, certain de&s;truction. Among my papers, there is not one which can be con&s;trued into guilt. They con&s;i&s;t of pamphlets unconnected with the politics of the day; and of the various publications of a &s;ociety, pure and un|tainted in its principles, of which I have the honour to be a member. But every thing mu&s;t be ran&s;acked to heap cr|mination upon my head. One of the letters which I hd undertaken to deliver in Scotland, is addre&s;&s;ed to the Re|verend Fi&s;che Palmer. Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k! cries the Lord Advocate, the company which this man keeps.&mdash;Who is Mr Palmer?&mdash;A per&s;on whom I have indicted for &s;edition, and who is to be tried in a few days at Perth!&mdash;Unheard of cruelty!&mdash;Un|exampled in&s;olence!&mdash;What!

Advocate,&mdash;The &s;eal upon the letter is a proof of the mo&s;t atrocious guilt. What is it?&mdash;Horrible to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell! It is the Cap of Liberty, &s;upported upon a &s;pear, with the words <HI>Ca lra</HI> above. All is con&s;i&s;tent. When you attempt to bani&s;h the &s;ub&s;tance of freedom&mdash;the &s;hadow mu&s;t fol|low! When a new coinage takes place, you have given a mo&s;t excellent hint. The officers of the mint, will profit by the le&s;&s;on, and they will no more &s;catter &s;edition through the land, by impre&s;&s;ing upon our halfpennies the figure of Brtiannia with a &s;pear in her hand, mounted with the <HI>Cap of Liberty.</HI> But I am a&s;hamed to enter into &s;uch trifles. If that letter had contained proofs of &s;edition, or of trea&s;on again&s;t me, Mr. Palmer, or the writer of it&mdash;the &s;eal&mdash;and the &s;pear&mdash;and the Cap of Liberty, would have been its feeble&s;t protection.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I now come to the la&s;t charge. That of hav|ing read, in the Convention of Delegates, the Addre&s;s from the Society of United Iri&s;hmen in Dublin.</P>
<P>I admit the fact, and I glory in the admi&s;&s;ion. The Pro|&s;ecutor has repre&s;ented that &s;ociety, as a gang of mean and nefarious con&s;pirators; and their diploma of my admi&s;&s;ion into their number, as an aggravation of my crime. Let me tell the Lord Advocate of Scotland, that &s;ociety &s;tands too high to be affected by his invective, or to require the aid of my defence. I am a member of that &s;ociety; and, in the la&s;t moments of my life, to have been &s;o, &s;hall be my honour and my pride. The Lord Advocate has repre&s;ent|ed to you, in general terms, that this addre&s;s amounts al|mo&s;t to trea&s;on; but he dur&s;t not attempt to point out, in his &s;peech, a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age which could &s;upport the a&s;per|&s;ion. I maintain that every line of that addre&s;s is &s;trictly con&s;titutional. You mu&s;t carry the whole of it along with you into your chamber, and not judge of pa&s;&s;ages &s;canda|lou&s;ly mutilated in the indictment. The mutilation of the very fir&s;t paragraph of the addre&s;s, is a proof of the fair|ne&s;s, and of the ingenuity of the Pro&s;ecutor. I beg leave to read how it &s;tands in the indictment, and then to read what follows in the addre&s;s it&s;elf:</P>
<P><Q>We take the liberty of addre&s;&s;ing you in the &s;pirit of civic-union, in the fellow&s;hip of a ju&s;t and common cau&s;e.
<PB N="116" REF="027633_0116_0FD619CA0F236D60">
We greatly rejoice that the &s;pirit of freedom moves over the &s;urface of Scotland; that light &s;eems to break from the chaos of her internal government; and that a country &s;o re&s;pectable for her attainments in &s;cience, in arts, and in arms; for men of literary eminence; for the intelligence and morality of her people, now acts from a conviction of the union between virtue, letters, and liberty; and, now ri&s;es to di&s;tinction, not by a calm, contented, &s;ecret wi&s;h for a Reform in Parliament, but by openly, actively, and urgently <HI>willing</HI> it, with the unity and e|nergy of an embodied nation. We rejoice that you do not con&s;ider your&s;elves as merged and melted down into another coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> but that in this great national que&s;tion, you are &s;till&mdash;Scotland.</Q> <HI>[See Appendix.]</HI></P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t paragraph libelled on. But, even as it is in the indictment. It is not permitted to the United Iri&s;hmen in Dublin, to congratulate this unfortunate peo|ple upon account of former eminence in literature, in arts, and in virtue;&mdash;and to expre&s;s the wi&s;h, that they would &s;till retain that enviable di&s;tinction? And, is that la&s;t and forlorn period now arrived, when tho&s;e who ex|pre&s;s &s;uch a wi&s;h, mu&s;t be called <HI>nefarious</HI> con&s;pirators, and he who has been the organ of its communication, mu&s;t be branded with the epithets of, a "wretch," of an "oracle of di&s;cord," of "a fiend of &s;edition!" The children of your children, in after ages, will not forget this ever-to-be-remem|bered night. But here let us &s;top. I have &s;aid that this indictment mutilated this pa&s;&s;age, as it does every other pa&s;&s;age in this Addre&s;s; It breaks off the paragraph at the words, "You are &s;till Scotland." It breaks off in the mid|dle of a &s;entence; and for what purpo&s;e?&mdash;to countenance an in&s;inuation, that the United Iri&s;hmen in Dublin wi&s;hed a di&s;&s;olution of the Union betwixt Scotland and England. The Pro&s;ecutor cuts off the remainder of the &s;entence which demon&s;trated the &s;en&s;e, in which the United Iri&s;hmen un|der&s;tood the words "&s;till Scotland," expre&s;&s;ing &s;olely their idea of her &s;till being di&s;tingui&s;hed by her former lu&s;|tre. The words which are &s;eparated from the &s;entence are in the addre&s;s as follows: <Q>That you are &s;till Scotland&mdash; the land where Buchanan wrote, and Fletcher &s;poke,
<PB N="117" REF="027633_0117_0FD556EAD442A928">
and Wallace fought.</Q> Yes, I give my &s;olemn a&s;&s;ent to this wi&s;h, and to this hope of the United Iri&s;hmen. My voice &s;hall re&s;ound, Scotland &s;hall &s;till be the land, where Buchanan has written, where Fletcher &s;poke, and where Wallace fought.</P>
<P>Let us attend to the mutilation of another pa&s;&s;age, in this extraordinary indictment. I &s;hall read it as it &s;tands:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>We will lay open to you our hearts: Our cau&s;e is your cau&s;e&mdash;If there is to be a &s;truggle between us, let it be which Nation &s;hall be foremo&s;t in the race of mind: let this be the noble animo&s;ity kindled between us, who &s;hall fir&s;t attain that free con&s;titution from which both are equi|di&s;tant, who &s;hall fir&s;t be the &s;aviour of the empire.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The &s;en&s;e of both countries with re&s;pect to intole|rable abu&s;es of the con&s;titution has been clearly manife&s;t|ed; and proves that our political &s;ituations are not di&s;&s;i|milar; that our rights and wrongs are the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age libelled upon &s;tops at the words "rights and wrongs are the &s;ame." But it forbears to take in the remain|der, in which the &s;imilarity of our rights and wrongs is &s;pe|cified. The &s;elf-elected magi&s;trates of Burghs&mdash;the unequal repre&s;entation of the People in Parliament&mdash;and the total privation, in Scotland, of the &s;hadow of popular Election.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will read over many pa&s;&s;ages of this Ad|dre&s;s, not merely becau&s;e they are the production of an im|mortal pen, but becau&s;e every word is regulated by the &s;pi|rit of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P><HI>[Here Mr. Muir read mo&s;t of the Addre&s;s; but we forbear to in&s;ert the particular pa&s;&s;ages, as the whole is in the Ap|pendix.]</HI></P>
<P>Can you call this addre&s;s &s;editious or inflammatory, which contains the following &s;entiment? <Q>If Government has a &s;incere regard for the &s;afety of the con&s;titution, let them coincide with the people in the &s;peedy reform of its abu&s;es, and not by an ob&s;tinate adherence to them, drive that people into Republicani&s;m.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, the Lord Advocate has repre&s;ented the au|thors of this addre&s;s, as the meane&s;t of mankind, and has ex|pre&s;sly called them infamous wretches, who had fled from the puni&s;hment due to their crimes. What &s;lander!&mdash;what

fal&s;e, unfounded &s;lander!&mdash;Has Doctor Drennan? Has Mr. Hamilton Rowan; who&s;e names are at the head of this addre&s;s, fled from crimes and from puni&s;hment? "And they are infamous wretches!" If ever after ages &s;hall hear of my name, I wi&s;h it may be recorded, that to the&s;e men I had the happine&s;s of being known. To be honoured by the no|tice of Doctor Drennan is an ambition to which, in the mo&s;t exalted &s;tation of life, I would fondly a&s;pire. To have it &s;aid, that I was the friend of Mr Hamilton Rowan. I would con&s;ider as the pa&s;&s;port to the only acquaintances whom I value; tho&s;e who found their claim to di&s;tinction upon the only true ba&s;is, their own virtues. Mr. Rowan is indeed indicted to &s;tand trial in Ireland, upon a charge &s;imilar to my own. Mr. Rowan has not fled. He will boldly meet his accu&s;ation; and, let me &s;ay, along with tho&s;e who know him, that, although it is impo&s;&s;ible to add any new lu&s;tre to his character, yet, as he has often come forward in the cau&s;e of individual humanity, he will di&s;play him|&s;elf upon that occa&s;ion, the firm, the intrepid, and, I hope the &s;ucce&s;sful champion of the liberties of his native coun|try.</P>
<P>I ha&s;ten to a conclu&s;ion. Much yet remains to &s;ay. But after, upon my part, the unremitted exertions of &s;ixteen hours, I feel my&s;elf nearly exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>Look once more, I entreat you, to the indictment, and compare it with evidence.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t charge again&s;t me is, that in public &s;peeches, I vilified the King and Con&s;titution. All the witne&s;&s;es addu|ced atte&s;t, that, both in public and in private, even in my mo&s;t unguarded moments, my language was always re|&s;pectful to the King, and that I always recommended the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The &s;econd charge again&s;t me, is, that of advi&s;ing the people to read &s;editious books, and of di&s;tributing inflam|matory publications among them: And you hear it proved by the unanimous voice of all the witne&s;&s;es for the Crown, that I refu&s;ed to recommend any books, and that the only one which I recommended, was Dr Henry's Hi&s;tory of England. You will not forget the circum&s;tance in which I lent Freeland a copy of Mr. Paine's Works; nor will you
<PB N="119" REF="027633_0119_0FD556EDB250D430">
forget the manner in which the writings of that man were introduced in conver&s;ation with Wil&s;on, Muir, and with Barclay. With regard to other books and pamphlets mentioned in the libel, there is not any proof. William Muir has de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oned, that I gave him one or two numbers of the Patriot, and &s;ome other pamphlets, who&s;e titles I can|not remember. William Muir is but a &s;ingle witne&s;s to this fact; and you know that, by the laws of Scot|land, the te&s;timony of a &s;ingle witne&s;s cannot claim any weight; but I frankly admit and acknowledge that I gave him tho&s;e numbers of the Patriot and, if I were not now entirely overcome by fatigue, I could demon&s;trate to you, that, in tho&s;e numbers, there is not a &s;ingle &s;entiment un|con&s;titutional or &s;editious.</P>
<P>I am accu&s;ed of reading the Iri&s;h Addre&s;s in the Conven|tion, and of moving a &s;olemn an&s;wer in return. That ad|dre&s;s is neither &s;editious, wicked, nor inflammatory. There is not a &s;entence in it, which I have not defended in your pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>You neither can do ju&s;tice to me, nor to the country, if you condemn the&s;e different publications, upon account of the &s;candalou&s;ly mutilated extracts from them in the libel. You mu&s;t carry the whole of them along with you from this place. It is not upon detached pa&s;&s;ages you are to judge; but you mu&s;t decide upon the whole.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>This is now perhaps the la&s;t time, that I &s;hall addre&s;s my country. I have explored the tenor of my pa&s;t life. Nothing &s;hall tear from me the record of my departed days. The enemies of Reform have &s;crutinized, in a manner hi|therto unexampled in Scotland, every action I may have performed, every word I may have uttered.&mdash;Of crimes, mo&s;t foul and horrible, have I been accu&s;ed.&mdash;Of attempt|ing to rear the &s;tandard of civil war, and to plunge this land in blood, and to cover this land with de&s;olation. At every &s;tep, as the evidence of the Crown advanced, my innocency has brightened. So far from inflaming the minds of men to &s;edition and to outrage&mdash;all the witne&s;&s;es have concurred, that my only anxiety was, to

impre&s;s upon them the nece&s;&s;ity of peace, of good order, and of good morals. What then has been my crime? Not the lending to a relation a copy of Mr. Paine's Works; not the giving away to another a few numbers of an innocent and con&s;titutional publication; but for having dared to be, according to the mea&s;ure of my feeble abilities, a &s;tre|nuous and active advocate for an equal repre&s;entation of the People&mdash;in the Hou&s;e of the People;&mdash;For having da|red to attempt to accompli&s;h a mea&s;ure, by legal means, which was to dimini&s;h the weight of their taxes, and to put an end to the profu&s;ion of their blood. From my in|fancy to this moment, I have devoted my&s;elf to the cau&s;e of the People. It is a good cau&s;e.&mdash;It &s;hall ultimately pre|vail.&mdash;It &s;hall finally triumph. Say then openly, in your verdict, if you do condemn me, which I pre&s;ume you will not,&mdash;That it is for my attachment to this cau&s;e alone, and not for tho&s;e vain and wretched pretexts &s;tated in the in|dictment, intended only to colour and di&s;gui&s;e the real motives of my accu&s;ation. The time will come, when men mu&s;t &s;tand or fall by their actions; when all hu|man peageantry &s;hall cea&s;e; when the hearts of all &s;hall be laid open. If you regard your mo&s;t important intere&s;ts,&mdash;if you wi&s;h that your con&s;cience &s;hould whi&s;per to you words of con&s;olation; or &s;peak to you in the terrible lan|guage of remor&s;e,&mdash;Weigh well the verdict you are to pro|nounce. As for me, I am carele&s;s and indifferent to my fate. I can look danger&mdash;and I can look death in the face, for I am &s;hielded by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own rectitude. I may be condenmned to langui&s;h in the rece&s;&s;es of a dun|geon&mdash;I may be doomed to a&s;cend the &s;caffold&mdash;Nothing can deprive me of the recollection of the pa&s;t&mdash;Nothing can de&s;troy my inward peace of mind, ari&s;ing from the re|membrance of having di&s;charged my duty.</P>

<P>The LORD JUSTICE CLERK, in &s;umming up the evidence,
<PB N="121" REF="027633_0121_0FD556F19F886EF8">
&s;aid, that the indictment was the longe&s;t he had ever &s;een; but it was not nece&s;&s;ary to prove the whole, in order to find the Pannel guilty, for the Jury had only to look at the concluding &s;entence of the indictment, from which it was plain, that if any one part of the libel was proven, it e&s;tab|li&s;hed the guilt of the Pannel the &s;ame as if the whole was &s;ub&s;tantiated.</P>
<P>Now, this is the que&s;tion for con&s;ideration.&mdash;Is the Pan|nel guilty of Sedition, or, is he not? Now, before this que&s;tion can be an&s;wered, two things mu&s;t be attended to that require no proof: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution is the <HI>be&s;t</HI> that ever was &s;ince the creation of the world, and it is not <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> to make it <HI>better;</HI> for, is not every man &s;ecure? Does not every man reap the fruits of his own in|du&s;try, and &s;it &s;afely under his own fig-tree? The <HI>next</HI> cir|cum&s;tance is, that there was a &s;pirit of &s;edition in this coun|try la&s;t winter, which made every good man very unea&s;y. And his Lord&s;hip coincided in opinion with the ma&s;ter of the grammar &s;chool of Gla&s;gow, who told Mr. Muir, that he thought propo&s;ing a reform was very ill timed. Yet Mr. Muir had, at that time, gone about among ignorant country people, making them forget their work, and told them that a reform was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving their liberty, which, if it had not been for him, they would never have thought was in danger. His Lord&s;hip did not doubt that this would appear to them as it did to him, to be &s;edition.</P>
<P>The next thing to be attended to, was the outlawry.&mdash;Running away from ju&s;tice, that was a mark of guilt. And what could he do in France at that period? pretending to be an amba&s;&s;ador to a foreign country without lawful au|thority, that was rebellion; and he pretends to have had influence with tho&s;e wretches, the leading men there And what kind of folks were they? His Lord&s;hip <HI>never liked the French all his days, but now he hated them.</HI></P>
<P>The Pannel's harranguing &s;uch multitudes of ignorant weavers about their grievances, might have been attended with the wor&s;t con&s;equences to the peace of the nation, and the &s;afety of our glorious con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Mr. Muir might have known, that no attention could be
<PB N="122" REF="027633_0122_0FD556F2DB7AE1B0">
paid to &s;uch a rabble. What right had they to repre&s;enta|tion? He could have told them that the Parliament would never li&s;ten to their petition: How could they think of it? A government in every country &s;hould be ju&s;t like a cor|poration; and, in this country, it is made up of the land|ed intere&s;t, which alone has a right to be repre&s;ented; as for the <HI>rabble,</HI> who have nothing but per&s;onal property what hold has the nation of them? What &s;ecurity for the payment of their taxes; they may pack up all their pro|perty on their backs, and leave the country <HI>in the twinkling of an eye,</HI> but landed property cannot be removed.</P>
<P>The tendency of the Pannel's conduct was plainly to pro|mote a &s;pirit of revolt, and, if what was demanded, was not given, to take it by force. His Lord&s;hip had not the &s;malle&s;t doubt that the Jury were, like him&s;elf, convinced of the Pannel's guilt, and de&s;ired them to return &s;uch a ver|dict as would do them honour.</P>

<P>The verdict being recorded, the LORD JUSTICE CLERK addre&s;&s;ed the Jury, and &s;aid, That this trial had been of the greate&s;t impotance. He was happy that they had be&s;towed &s;o much attention upon it, and informed them, that the Court highly approved of the verdict they had given. He then de&s;ired their Lord&s;hips to give their opinion upon this verdict, and what puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflicted.</P>
<P>Which they did to the following purport:&mdash;</P>
<P>LORD HENDERLAND ob&s;erved, that the alarming &s;ituation in which this country was during the cour&s;e of la&s;t winter, gave unea&s;ine&s;s to all thinking men: His Lord&s;hip &s;aid, that he now arrived at the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable part of the duty incumbent upon him, which was to fix the puni&s;hment due to the crime, of which the Pannel was found guilty. The indictment contained a charge of &s;edition, exciting a &s;pirit of di&s;content among the inferior cla&s;&s;es of people, and an attack again&s;t the <HI>Glorious Con&s;titution</HI> of this coun|try the Jury, by the verdict which they had returned, and to which the Court had alone recour&s;e, had found the Pan|nel guilty; and it was their Lord&s;hips duty only, now to fix the puni&s;hment due to the offence. His Lord&s;hip &s;aid, that he would not dwell upon the evil con&s;equences of the crimes committed by the pri&s;oner. The melancholy exam|ple of a neighbouring country, which would forever &s;tain the page of hi&s;tory, rendered it unnece&s;&s;ary for him to re|capitulate the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e. In that country, the con&s;equences of &s;uch mea&s;ures have produced every kind of violence, rapine, and murder. There appeared, he &s;aid, to have been in this country a regular plan of &s;edi|tious mea&s;ures. The indecent applau&s;e which was given to Mr. Muir la&s;t night, at the conclu&s;ion of his defence, within the&s;e walls, unknown to that High Court, and in|con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;olemnity which ought to pervade the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and which was in&s;ulting to the laws and dignity of that court, proved to him that the &s;pirit of &s;editon had not as yet &s;ub&s;ided. He would not, he &s;aid, &s;eek to aggravate the offence committed by the Pannel, by the mi&s;conduct of others, in order to increa&s;e the puni&s;hment. The puni&s;hment to be inflicted is arbitra|ry,
<PB N="124" REF="027633_0124_0FD619D5DDCB9810">
of which there is a variety. Bani&s;hment, he ob&s;erved would be improper, as it would only be &s;ending to another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, a man, where he might have the opportunity of exciting the &s;ame &s;pirit of di&s;content, and &s;owing with a plentiful hand &s;edition; whipping, was too &s;evere, and di&s;graceful, the more e&s;pecially to a man who had bore his character and rank in life. And impri&s;onment, he con&s;ider|ed, would be but a temporary puni&s;hment, when the crimi|nal would be again let loo&s;e; and &s;o again di&s;turb the hap|pine&s;s of <HI>the People.</HI> There remains but one puni&s;hment in our law, and <HI>it wrung his very heart</HI> to mention it, viz. <HI>Tran&s;portation.</HI> It was a duty he con&s;idered he owed to his countrymen, to pronounce it, in the &s;ituation in which he &s;at, as the puni&s;hment due to his crimes. His Lord&s;hip ob&s;erved, it was extraordinary that a gentleman of his de&s;|cription, of his profe&s;&s;ion, and of the talents he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;hould be guilty of a crime de&s;erving &s;uch a puni&s;hment, but he &s;aw no alterative. For what &s;ecurity could we have again&s;t his future operations, but a removal from his country, to a place where he could do no further harm. His Lord|&s;hip was therefore of opinion, that the Pannel &s;hould be re|committed to pri&s;on, there to remain, till a proper oppor|tunity &s;hould offer for tran&s;porting him, to &s;uch place as his Maje&s;ty, with the advice of his Privy Council, might ap|point for the &s;pace of <HI>Fourteen years</HI> from the date of the &s;entence; and that he &s;hould not return within that period under the pain of death.</P>
<P>LORD SWINTON &mdash;The crime with which the Pannel is, by the <HI>Jury</HI> of his country, found guilty, is <HI>&s;edition.</HI> It is a generic crime, and which is defined by our lawyers, to be a commotion of the people without authority, and of exciting others to &s;uch commotion again&s;t the public wel|fare. This crime, he ob&s;erved, con&s;i&s;ted of many grada|tions, and might have run from a petty mob, about wages, even to high trea&s;on. He thought the puni&s;hment &s;hould be adapted to the crime. The que&s;tion, he &s;aid, was then, What was the degree of the crime the Pannel has been guil|ty of. That was to be di&s;covered from the libel, of which he has been found guilty by the unanimous verdict of a re|&s;pectable Jury of his country. It appeared to him, to be a
<PB N="125" REF="027633_0125_0FD556F6E9BC8648">
crime of the mo&s;t henious kind, and there was &s;carcely a di&s;tinction betwen it and <HI>high trea&s;on.</HI> As by the di&s;&s;olu|tion of the &s;ocial compact it made way for, and &s;o it might be &s;aid, to include every &s;ort of <HI>crime, murder, robbery, ra|pine, fire-rai&s;ings,</HI> in &s;hort every &s;pecies of wrong, public and private. This, he ob&s;erved, was no theoretical rea|&s;oning, for we had it exemplified before our eyes, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of France, where, under the pretence of a&s;&s;ert|ing liberty, the wor&s;t &s;ort of tyranny was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and all the loyal and moral ties which bind mankind were bro|ken. Nay, &s;hameful to tell, even religion it&s;elf was laid a|&s;ide, and publicly di&s;avowed by the National Convention.</P>
<P>Certain wretched per&s;ons, a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves, mo&s;t fal&s;ely and in&s;idiou&s;ly, the re&s;pectable name of Friends of the People, and of Reform, although they de&s;erved the <HI>very op|po&s;ite</HI> denomination, by which means they have mi&s;led, and drawn after them, a great number of well-meaning, though &s;imple and unwary people.</P>
<P>If puni&s;hment, adequate to the crime, were to be &s;ought for, there could be found no puni&s;hment in our law &s;uffici|ent for the crime in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, now that torture is happily aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>By the Roman law, which is held to be our common law where there is no &s;tatute, the puni&s;hment was various, and tran&s;portation was among the milde&s;t mentioned. Paulus, L. 38. Dig, <HI>de Poenis,</HI> writes, <HI>Actores &s;editionis et tumultus, populo concitato, pro qualitate dignitatis&punc; aut in furcam tol|lunter, aut be&s;tiis objiciuntur, aut in in&s;ulam deportanter.</HI>&mdash;We have cho&s;en the milde&s;t of the&s;e puni&s;hments. By the <HI>Codex,</HI> lib. 9 t. 30. <HI>de Seditio&s;is et his qui plebem contra rem|publicam audent collegere,</HI> l. 1. &amp; 2. &s;uch per&s;ons are &s;ub|jected, <HI>ad mulctam gravi&s;&s;imam.</HI>&mdash;Baldus writes, <HI>Provocans tumultum et clamor em in populo, debet mori poena &s;editionis.</HI>&mdash;And by a con&s;titution of the emperor Leo: <HI>Subdandos au|tem poenis cis quas de &s;editionis et tumultus auctoribus vetu&s;ti&s;|&s;ima decreta &s;anxerient.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ole object of puni&s;hment among us, is only to deter others from committing the like crimes in time coming.&mdash;Therefore the puni&s;hment &s;hould be made equal to the crime. All that is nece&s;&s;ary is, that it &s;erve as an example and ter|ror
<PB N="126" REF="027633_0126_0FD619D6A5305708">
to others, in time coming, again&s;t a repetition of the like offence. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, he thought that <HI>Tran&s;|portation</HI> was the lighe&s;t puni&s;hment that could be a&s;&s;igned, and that for the &s;pace of fourteen years, under the certifi|cation of death, in ca&s;e of returning before the expiration of that term.</P>
<P>LORD DUNSINNAN.&mdash;His Lord&s;hip &s;poke in &s;o low a tone of voice, that we had not an opportunity of following him, throughout the whole of his opinion. He however agreed, with the re&s;t of their Lord&s;hips, in the puni&s;hment which they &s;aid Mr. Muir de&s;erved, viz. Tran&s;portation for four|teen years, with the u&s;ual certification, &amp;c.</P>
<P>LORD ABERCROMBY.&mdash;His Lord&s;hip did not think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ay much as to the enormity of the crime, after what had been already &s;aid. By our law, it might have a|mounted to trea&s;on, and even as the law now &s;tands, it came very near it.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved, that Mr. Muir la&s;t night, when conducting his defence, had &s;tated, and which was marked, and it had great weight with him, <Q>That the people &s;hould be cau|tious, and by all manner of means avoid tumults and di&s;orders, for through time the ma&s;s of the people would bring about a Revolution</Q> (Here Mr. Muir ro&s;e, and &s;aid, "I deny it, my Lord, it is totally fal&s;e.") If any thing could add to the improper nature of the Pannel's de|fence, it was his pretended mi&s;&s;ion to France, and the hap|pine&s;s, he expre&s;&s;ed, in the circle of acquaintance he had there. It was evident, &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, that his feelings did too much accord with the feelings of tho&s;e mon&s;ters.&mdash;His Lord&s;hip coincided with the re&s;t of their Lord&s;hips, in regard to the puni&s;hment, which, they had given as their opinion, Mr. Muir de&s;erved.</P>
<P>LORD JUSTICE CLERK&mdash;His Lord&s;hip &s;aid, he was con|&s;iderably affected to &s;ee the pannel &s;tand trial for &s;edition, a man who had got a liberal education, was member of a re|&s;pectable &s;ociety, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable talents, and had &s;u&s;|tained a re&s;pectable character. His Lord&s;hip con&s;idered the very lowe&s;t &s;pecies of this crime as heinous, and that it was aggravated according to the object in view. Here the ob|ject was important; for it was creating in the lower cla&s;&s;es
<PB N="127" REF="027633_0127_0FD556F99819B938">
of people, di&s;loyalty, and di&s;&s;atisfaction to government, and this amounting to the highe&s;t &s;ort of &s;edition, is bordering on trea&s;on, and a little more would have made the Pannel &s;tand trial for his life.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip agreed in the propriety of the propo&s;ed pu|ni&s;hment, and he ob&s;erved that the indecent applau&s;e which was given the Pannel la&s;t night, convinced him, that a &s;pi|rit of di&s;content &s;till lurked in the minds of the people, and that it would be dangerous to allow him to remain in this country. His Lord&s;hip &s;aid, this circum&s;tance had no little weight with him, when con&s;idering of the puni&s;hment Mr. Muir de&s;erved. He never had a doubt but tran&s;portation was the proper puni&s;hment for &s;uch a crime, but he only he&s;itated whether it &s;hould be for life, or for the term of fourteen years!&mdash;The latter he preferred, and he hoped the Pannel would reflect on his pa&s;t conduct, and &s;ee the impro|priety which he had committed, and that if he &s;hould be a|gain re&s;tored to his country, he might &s;till have an oppor|tunity of &s;howing him&s;elf to be a good member of that con|&s;titution which he &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e &s;o much.</P>
<P>After his Lord&s;hip had delivered his opinion, and during the time the &s;entence was recording, Mr. Muir ro&s;e and &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk, I have only a few words to &s;ay, I &s;hall not animadvert upon the &s;everity or the leniency of my &s;entence. Were I to be led this moment from the bar to the &s;caffold, I &s;hould feel the &s;ame calmne&s;s and &s;erenity which I now do. My mind tells me, that I have acted agreeable to my con&s;cience, and that I have engaged in a good, a ju&s;t, and a glorious cau&s;e,&mdash;a cau&s;e which &s;ooner or later mu&s;t, and will, prevail; and, by a timely reform &s;ave this country from de|&s;truction.</HI></P>

<P>I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter re&s;pect|ing the bu&s;ine&s;s of Mr. Muir. I did not lo&s;e a moment in finding a &s;afe and &s;peedy conveyance to him at Paris for your letters, and tho&s;e of his other friends in Scotland, &s;ent to my care. I delayed from day to day in the perpetual ex|pectation of &s;eeing Mr. Muir here on his return.

<P><Q>The &s;en&s;e of both countries with re&s;pect to the intoler|able abu&s;es of the con&s;titution has been clearly manife&s;t|ed, and proves that our political &s;ituations are not di&s;&s;imi|lar; that our rights and wrongs are the &s;ame.</Q> Out of 32 counties in Ireland, 29 petitioned for a Reform in Par|liament; and out of 56 of the Royal Burghs in Scotland, 50 petitioned for a Reform in their internal &s;tructure and Government. If we be rightly informed, there is no &s;uch thing as popular election in Scotland. The people who ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s that weight in the popular &s;cale, which might bind them to the &s;oil, and make them cling to the con&s;titution, are now as du&s;t in the balance, blown abroad by the lea&s;t impul&s;e, and &s;cattered through other countries, merely because they hang &s;o loo&s;ely to their own. They have no &s;hare in the national <HI>Firm,</HI> and are aggrieved not only by irregular and illegal exaction of taxes; by mi&s;rule and mi&s;management of corporations; by mi&s;conduct of &s;elf-elected and irre&s;pon&s;ible magi&s;trates; by wa&s;te of public property; and by want of competent judicatures; but, in our opinion, mo&s;t of all, by an inadequate Parliamentary repre&s;entation&mdash;for we a&s;&s;ert, that 45 Commoners, and 16 Peers, are a pitiful repre&s;entation for two millions and a half of people; particularly as your Commons con&s;ider them|&s;elves, not as the repre&s;entatives of that people, but of the Councils of the Burghs by whom they are elected.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive charters in favour of Burghs, monopolize the general rights of the people, and that act mu&s;t be ab&s;urd, which precludes all other towns from the power of being re&s;tored to their ancient freedom.</P>
<P>We remember that heritable juri&s;dictions and feudal pri|vileges, though expre&s;sly re&s;erved by the act of union, (20th art.) were &s;et a&s;ide by act of Parliament in 1746, and we think that there is much &s;tronger ground at pre&s;ent for re&s;toring to the ma&s;s of the people their alienated rights, and to the Con&s;titution its &s;pirit and its integrity.</P>
<P>Look now we pray you upon Ireland. Long was this unfortunate i&s;land the prey of prejudiced factions and fero|cious parties. The rights or rather duties of conque&s;t were

dreadfully abu&s;ed, and the catholic religion was made the perpetual pretext for &s;ubjecting the &s;tate by annihilating the citizen, and de&s;troying not the religious per&s;ua&s;ion but the man; not popery, but the people. It was not till very late|ly, that the part of the nation, which is truly colonial, re|flected that though their ance&s;tors had been victorious, they them&s;elves were now included in the general &s;ubjection; &s;ub|duing only to be &s;ubdued, and trampled upon, by Britain as a &s;ervile dependency. When therefore the Prote&s;tants be|gan to &s;uffer what the Catholics had &s;uffered and were &s;uffer|ing; when from &s;erving as the in&s;truments they were made them&s;elves the objects of foreign domination, then they be|came con&s;cious they had a country; and then they felt&mdash;an Ireland.&mdash;They re&s;i&s;ted Briti&s;h dominion, renounced colo|nial &s;ub&s;ervience, and following the example of a Catholic Parliament ju&s;t a century before, they a&s;&s;erted the exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction and legi&s;lative competence of this i&s;land. A &s;ud|den light from America &s;hone through our pri&s;on. Our Vo|lun-teers aro&s;e. The chains fell from our hands. We followed Grattan, the angel of our deliverance, and in 1782 Ireland cea&s;ed to be a province, and became a nation. But, with rea&s;on, &s;hould we de&s;pi&s;e and renounce this Revolution, as merely a tran&s;ient bur&s;t through a bad habit; the &s;udden gra&s;p of nece&s;&s;ity in de&s;pair, from tyranny in di&s;tre&s;s, did we not believe that the Revolution was &s;till <HI>in train;</HI> that it is le&s;s the &s;ingle and &s;hining act of 82, than a &s;eries of na|tional improvements which that act u&s;hers in and announc|es; that it is only the herald of liberty and glory, of Catho|lic emancipation, as well as prote&s;tant independence; that, in &s;hort this Revolution indicates new principles, foreruns new practices, and lays a foundation for advancing the whole people higher in the &s;cale of being, and diffu&s;ing equal and permanent happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Briti&s;h &s;upremacy changed its a&s;pect, but its e&s;&s;ence re|mained the &s;ame. Fir&s;t it was force, and on the event of the late Revolution, it became influence; direct ho&s;tility &s;hifted into &s;y&s;tematic corruption, &s;ilently drawing off the virtue and vigour of the i&s;land, without &s;hock or explo&s;ion. Corruption that glides into every place, tempts every per&s;on, taints every principle, infects the political mind through all

<P>The Prote&s;tants of Ireland were now &s;en&s;ible that nothing could counteract this plan of debilitating policy, but a radical reform in the hou&s;e of the people, and that without &s;uch re|form, the Revolution it&s;elf was nominal and delu&s;ive&mdash;The wheel merely turned round, but it did not move forward, and they were as di&s;tant as ever from the goal. They re&s;olv|ed.&mdash;They convened.&mdash;They met with arms.&mdash;They met without them.&mdash;They petitioned. But all in vain&mdash;for, they were but a portion of the people. They then looked around and beheld their catholic countrymen. Three million&mdash;we repeat it&mdash;three million taxed without being repre&s;ented, bound by laws to which they had not given con&s;ent, and po|litically dead in their native land. The apathy of the catho|lic mind changed into &s;ympathy, and that begot an energy of &s;entiment and action. They had eyes, and they read. They had ears, and they li&s;tened. They had hearts, and they felt. They &s;aid&mdash;"Give us our rights as you value your own. Give us a &s;hare of civil and political liberty, the elec|tive franchi&s;e, and the trial by jury. Treat us as men, and we &s;hall treat you as brothers. Is taxation without repre|&s;entation a grievance to three millions acro&s;s the Atlantic, and no grievance to three millions at your doors?&mdash;Throw down that pale of per&s;ecution, which &s;till keeps up civil war in Ireland, and make us one people. We &s;hall then &s;tand, &s;upporting and &s;upported, in the a&s;&s;ertion of that liberty which is due to all, and which all &s;hould unite to attain."</P>
<P>It was ju&s;t&mdash;and immediately a principle of adhe&s;ion took place for the fir&s;t time, among the inhabitants of Ireland.&mdash;All religious per&s;ua&s;ions found in a political union their com|mon duty and their common &s;alvation. In this &s;ociety and its affiliated &s;ocieties, the Catholic and the Pre&s;byterian are at this in&s;tant holding out their hands and opening their hearts to each other, agreeing in principles, concurring in

practice. We unite for immediate, ample, and &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice to the Catholics, and when that is attained, a combi|ned exertion for a Reform in Parliament is the condition of our compact, and the &s;eal of our communion.</P>
<P>Briti&s;h &s;upremacy takes alarm. The haughty monopo|li&s;ts of national power and common right, who crouch a|broad to domineer at home, now look with more &s;urpri&s;e and le&s;&s; contempt on this "be&s;orted" people.

It is not upon a coalition of oppo&s;ition with mini&s;try that we depend, but upon a coalition of Iri&s;hmen with Iri&s;hmen, and in that coalition alone we find an object worthy of re|form, and at the &s;ame time the &s;trength and &s;inew to at|tain and &s;ecure it. It is not external circum&s;tances, upon the pledge of man or mini&s;ter, we depend, but upon the in|ternal energy of the Iri&s;h nation. We will not buy or bor|row liberty from America or from France, but manufac|ture it our&s;elves, and work it up with tho&s;e materials that the hearts of Iri&s;hmen furni&s;h them with at home. We do not wor&s;hip the Briti&s;h, far le&s;s the Iri&s;h Con&s;titution, as &s;ent down from heaven, but we con&s;ider it as human workman&s;hip, which man has made and man can mend.

An unalterable Con&s;titution, whatever be its nature, mu&s;t be de&s;poti&s;m.

If Government has a &s;incere regard for the &s;afety of the con|&s;titution, let them coincide with the people in the &s;peedy re|form of its abu&s;es, and not by an ob&s;tinate adherence to them, drive that people into Republicani&s;m.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Edinburgh,</HI> <DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 2. 1793.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ought to have wrote you on Saturday, to give your So|ciety the means of contradicting the a&s;per&s;ion, which you
<PB N="148" REF="027633_0148_0FD5571E12743288">
will &s;ee by the accounts of Mr. Muir's trial, has been thrown upon them. I have not been able to command a &s;ettled thought &s;ince the alarming i&s;&s;ue of that a&s;toni&s;hing trial. I never had a higher opinion of any per&s;on's integrity, up|rightne&s;s, and philanthropy; nor is it dimini&s;hed, but in|crea&s;ed. The feelings which I mu&s;t therefore have had &s;ince that event, will plead my excu&s;e with men of feeling.</P>
<P>In the evidence which I was called on to give, I &s;tated the rea&s;on for his going to London, and that I had received a letter from Mr. Muir, when at London, explaining the cau&s;e of his proceeding to Paris; which letter I was very &s;orry that I could not produce, though I had pre&s;erved it carefully. Being de&s;ired to &s;tate, if I could recollect the rea&s;on which Mr. Muir a&s;&s;igned in that letter for his journey to Paris, I &s;aid, that it was the opinion of friends, that if Mr. Muir would go to Paris, he might have great influence with many to mitigate the &s;entence of the French King. The&s;e friends were taken for your Society; and much free|dom was u&s;ed, to reprobate both the Society of the Friends of the People in London, for pre&s;uming to &s;end a mi&s;&s;ionary into another country; and Mr. Muir, for accepting &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion But I declare upon my honour, that the thought of his being &s;ent by the Society of the Friends of the People in London, never came into my mind: And if I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf &s;o, which it is impo&s;&s;ible I could do, I expre&s;&s;ed a fal&s;ehood; and which I am bound, in ju&s;tice to the Society, in this manner to contradict.</P>
