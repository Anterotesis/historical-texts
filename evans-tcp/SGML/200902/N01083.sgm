<P>It may be there never was more <HI>Mirth,</HI> nor under le&s;s <HI>Regulation,</HI> than in this <HI>Age,</HI> and among too many in this <HI>Place.</HI> A great deal of <HI>Plea|&s;antry</HI> there is in the <HI>Town,</HI> and very graceful and charming it is &s;o far as it is Innocent and Wi&s;e.

<P>THERE are the Speci|al Sea&s;ons of the Par|ticular Duties of the Chri&s;tian Life, and <HI>every thing is beautiful in its Sea&s;on;</HI> mo&s;t acceptable then to God, Profitable to us, and Fair in the eyes of the World. <HI>A Time

there is to every Purpo&s;e, &mdash; A Time to Weep, and a Time to Laugh; a Time to Mourn, and a Time to Dance.</HI> It is therefore a great point of Chri&s;tian Skill and Wi&s;dom, obediently to <HI>Time</HI> our Duties, as God in his vari|ous Providences directs and com|mands us.</P>
<P>We are very prone to Err in e|very State, and in all our Frames. The Devil is ready to &s;uit his Temptations, and the Corruption within us &s;hows it &s;elf variou&s;ly, but with equal impetuous Lu&s;tings, as our Condition and Temper in this changing World do alter. It particularly lu&s;ts again&s;t the Duty of the pre&s;ent Day, and like an expert Enemy tries to make its advantage of all that occurs, and to divert us from making ours. On the contrary, where the Grace of God is lively and vigorous, it in|fluences to tho&s;e particular Duties which are <HI>peculiarly proper and in|cumbent</HI> under pre&s;ent Providences,

good account. The <HI>Rules</HI> are wor|thy of &s;uch a <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> as they were the practice of an <HI>equal Apo&s;tle,</HI> who &s;aid of him&s;elf, <HI>I know both how to be aba&s;ed, &amp; I know how to abound; every where and in all things I am in&s;tructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to &s;uffer need.</HI> So wou'd the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> in|&s;truct us al&s;o, how to &s;erve God and pre&s;erve Fellow&s;hip with him, how to carry on the proper work of our Lives, and maintain a ble&s;|&s;ed Intercour&s;e with Heaven, whe|ther we are <HI>Merry or Sad.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, every inordinacy of our affections will interrupt it. <HI>World|ly Sorrow</HI> and <HI>Sen&s;ual Mirth</HI> have one and the &s;ame effect: they are nece&s;&s;arily the Intermi&s;&s;ion of a clo&s;e walk with God, and con&s;pire in <HI>working Death:</HI> they offend the Holy Spirit, and provoke him to withdraw from us. Immoderate Sorrows break the vigour of the engaged Spirit, enfeeble and &s;ink

it: Intemperate Plea&s;ures &s;en&s;ua|lize it, and it becomes light and frothy: But if our affections be well limited and directed, they do excellently &s;ub&s;erve unto the Ex|erci&s;e of Grace. We may be &s;or|rowful and yet &s;erious, re&s;ign'd and thankful; and we may be chear|ful and yet grave, devout and hea|venly. It is utterly an Error to think, <HI>that a mournful Spirit does on|ly or be&s;t &s;uit Exerci&s;es of Devotion:</HI> You need not of nece&s;&s;ity always get the frame of your Spirit alter'd before you draw nigh to God, on|ly improve the pre&s;ent frame to Serve him withal; for if it be not irregular and inordinate in it &s;elf, there are Religious Acts or Servi|ces peculiarly adapted to it.</P>
<P>Many people if they are &s;ad and pen&s;ive, are apt to think, this is a &s;erious frame, and proper to help me in Retirement or in pub|lick Wor&s;hip; but if in a <HI>chearful vein,</HI> they go abroad to be <HI>merry:</HI>

Whereas they might be as laudably and as profitably <HI>now</HI> in their Clo|&s;ets or in the Church as before, and it may be rather the more &s;o, becau&s;e a chearful &s;pirit will go about Religious Duties, as well as Worldly Works, with the more life, delight and zeal.</P>
<P>Let every man therefore in that circum&s;tance of Life wherein he is, <HI>Walk with God.</HI> Let no <HI>State</HI> or <HI>Frame</HI> prove your temptation; but as the&s;e alter, remember that the &s;ame work is to be carried on not|with&s;tanding, only in a different manner. So that our bu&s;ine&s;s is to enquire, and &s;atisfie our &s;elves from the Word of God, what the duty of the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tance or Frame is: Am I now Sorrow|ful? Yet let me not be duller and le&s;s active in Religion than before. Or, Am I in a plea&s;ant Humour? Let me not be le&s;s &s;erious, le&s;s thoughtful of my Spiritual and E|ternal State. <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> may now

pre&s;erve, continue and increa&s;e that Communion with God, which before was carried on by <HI>Humilia|tions and Prayers.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Second</HI> In&s;tructive and U&s;eful <HI>Le&s;&s;on</HI> &s;ugge&s;ted in the <HI>Text</HI> is this: <HI>That every Ornament, Gift and Ac|compli&s;hment of our Souls is a Talent lent us by God, to be improv'd in his Service, and return'd to him again in way of tribute and acknowledgment.

<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>A Chearful Spirit, or Plea|&s;antne&s;s of Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition, is a precious gift of God, a happy &amp; love|ly thing, and to be u&s;ed to his Glory.</HI> Such a Chri&s;tian mu&s;t e&s;pecially recommend Religion in his Life, as a &s;eal to that Truth, <HI>Her wayes are wayes of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her
