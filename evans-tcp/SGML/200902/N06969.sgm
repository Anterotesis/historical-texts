<P>_HAVING formed a variety of re&s;olutions with regard to the &s;ubject on which I &s;hould ad|dre&s;s you, my honoured hearers, on this occa&s;ion; having found my&s;elf di&s;&s;atisfied with them all, for one rea&s;on or another; and having felt a growing apprehen&s;ion, that the very great re&s;pect to which this audience is en|titled, would not leave me &s;ufficient recollection and pre|&s;ence of mind, to explain my&s;elf in &s;o ea&s;y, free, and na|tural a manner, upon a particular argument that &s;truck me; I at length determined, contrary to my fir&s;t inten|tion, to read to you a di&s;cour&s;e, which, I am afraid, may appear le&s;s proper, but which, I am per&s;uaded, cannot be deemed improper in an age of domineering plea&s;ure, like this; an age, that amid&s;t many valuable improvements in arts and &s;ciences, and many high exertions of civil and military virtue, which di&s;tingui&s;h it, doth &s;till retain too much of that luxury and effeminacy, which &s;ome &s;erious writers, and many &s;erious men, have ranked among&s;t its characteri&s;tic features.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="008857_0004_102FF87ADAEEF560">The very lively and affecting pa&s;&s;age, of which our text is a part, I leave to your attentive peru&s;al, and pious reflexion, when you go home. Let it &s;uffice to ob&s;erve in the mean time, that it pre&s;ents us with the mo&s;t &s;triking picture, which perhaps is any where to be met with, of a young man en&s;nared by the blandi&s;hments of an abandon|ed, but artful woman, into who&s;e evening-walks he had thrown him&s;elf, with a fatal purpo&s;e, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to indulge the impul&s;e of his pa&s;&s;ions, under the covert of night, e&s;teeming that the fitte&s;t &s;ea&s;on for tho&s;e works of darkne&s;s. The character which our divine proverbiali&s;t gives of this unhappy youth, is &s;trongly pointed, and me|rits our particular attention: "I looked and beheld," &s;aith he,
<Q>among the &s;imple ones, I di&s;cerned among the youths, a young man void of under&s;tanding:</Q>
a cha|racter, which viewed in the connexion wherein it &s;tands, will, I doubt not, on a little con&s;ideration, appear exceed|ing ju&s;t. To prove it &s;uch, by entering into the detail, and to apply it, as indeed it is but too applicable, to tho&s;e young per&s;ons of the pre&s;ent age, who are &s;educed into the purlieus of criminal indulgence, and trained on by the enticements of evil communication, will, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, be the bu&s;ine&s;s of the following addre&s;s. How happy &s;hould the preacher account him&s;elf, if any thing that &s;hall be &s;ugge&s;ted, might be u&s;eful, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, either to recover, were it but one youth, who hath been entangled by that wheedling, pernicious pro&s;titute, called, by the world's courte&s;y, Plea&s;ure, or to guard the unex|perienced and unwary part of this congregation, who may be in danger from her deadly &s;nares! Now I will endea|vour to demon&s;trate, that the young man, who gives him|&s;elf over to voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, is really void of under&s;tand|ing, ina&s;much as he wants ta&s;te in what belongs to genu|ine plea&s;ure; &s;entiment in what relates to true glory; and prudence in point of his mo&s;t important intere&s;ts.</P>
<P N="1">I. I will &s;hew that he wants ta&s;te in what belongs to
<PB N="7" REF="008857_0005_102FF87D69EA29E0">
genuine plea&s;ure, that is, on the very &s;ubject which he pretends to under&s;tand be&s;t, and where he even piques him&s;elf on the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uperiority of his &s;kill. Suffer me, my dear hearer, whoever you are, whom this di&s;cour&s;e doth chiefly concern, to convince you how much you are mi&s;taken in your favourite &s;y&s;tem, by &s;hewing that the uncontrolled gratification of your appetites deprives you of the very &s;atisfaction you aim at, robs you of a thou&s;and delights of a much higher reli&s;h, and expo&s;eth you to in|numerable pains, which far overbalance the plea&s;ures you are &s;o fond of.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;ay that the unbridled pur&s;uit of &s;en&s;ual enjoy|ments defeats its own intention. Such is the wi&s;e and righteous appointment of providence, to deter men from di&s;honouring their maker, and them&s;elves, that exce&s;s of every kind, and this e&s;pecially, de&s;troys the very end it &s;eeks, hurts the body as well as the mind, and di&s;appoints the benevolent purpo&s;es of nature, by going beyond them. I appeal, my friend, to your own experience: Do not you feel your con&s;titution impaired and dulled by a cour&s;e of intemperance? Are you not forced, if you will con|tinue the chace you are engaged in, to &s;pur your jaded de&s;ires, by all the methods which fancy, variety, and a &s;uper-refined luxury can furni&s;h? The&s;e indeed may &s;erve to inflame your pa&s;&s;ions, but, alas! the more they are inflamed, the farther are they from being &s;atisfied. New objects may excite new propen&s;ions; but the diver|&s;ity of the one doth not keep pace with the violence of the other. The rage of plea&s;ure grows, but the &s;en&s;e of it dimini&s;heth; till at la&s;t you do not &s;o properly pur&s;ue it, as you are dragged along by it. The attachment and liking to it are in a great mea&s;ure &s;oon over: mere u&s;e and habit hurry you headlong. It is po&s;&s;ible indeed you &s;et out with re&s;olutions of re&s;training your&s;elf within certain fancied bounds of &s;obriety and prudence, of pre&s;erving a &s;ort of oeconomy and coolne&s;s, in the indulgence of your inclina|tions.
<PB N="8" REF="008857_0006_102FF87FB75CF558">
Have you adhered to the&s;e re&s;olutions? Have you practi&s;ed this &s;elf-command for any &s;pace of time? Is your bent to &s;inful gratifications no &s;tronger now, than when you fir&s;t gave way to them? Can you &s;till &s;top, when and where you plea&s;e? Can you &s;ay to the incroach|ing current of pa&s;&s;ion,
<Q>Hitherto &s;halt thou come, and no farther?</Q>
Ah the vanity and illu&s;ion that are in|&s;eparable from &s;in, the &s;elf-deceit and folly of &s;inners! to think that they can tran&s;gre&s;s with &s;afety the boundaries of innocence, or an&s;wer for them&s;elves, that having once en|tered on the declivity of vice, they &s;hall not &s;lide into a quicker and quicker progre&s;s, till at length they &s;ink into all "the &s;uperfluity of naughtine&s;s."</P>
<P>Nothing more common than for the &s;ons of intemperance to boa&s;t of their rea&s;on, their refinement, their &s;entiments, and the like. But have they cau&s;e to do &s;o? Your bre|thren of the &s;tall, and of the fore&s;t, eat, and drink, and play, and gratify the appetites of nature, in due &s;ea&s;on, mea&s;ure, and proportion. Therefore they are well and happy, according to their rank. Thou who art called a man, can&s;t not pretend to &s;o much order and felicity.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons who&s;e character I draw, are proud to &s;tyle them&s;elves Men of plea&s;ure. The world adopts the phra&s;e, and be&s;tows it on them freely: but I aver they do not de&s;erve this title. You are mere &s;en&s;ation-men; you are &s;trangers to &s;incere, to real plea&s;ure. That con&s;i&s;ts in regularity, and dwells with innocence alone. Figure a young man ma&s;ter of his pa&s;&s;ions, diligent in bu&s;ine&s;s, or a&s;&s;iduous in &s;tudy, &s;mitten with the charms of truth, of friend&s;hip, of virtue, of devotion, following their divine attraction through the &s;lippery paths of youth, and in due time entering, with judgment and choice, into that honoura|ble &s;tate, which heaven has ordained for the &s;upport and comfort of mankind. Will tho&s;e ungodly men, who fore|go the cha&s;te and heart-felt delights of this amiable con|nexion for the bought &s;miles and mercenary care&s;&s;es of a
<PB N="9" REF="008857_0007_102FF8821877F250">
harlot, "lovele&s;s, joyle&s;s, unendeared," pretend to equal the&s;e latter to the former, or once to compare their law|le&s;s, re&s;tle&s;s, &s;elfi&s;h pur&s;uits, to the tranquil, the virtuous, the generous joys of an union, which, when wi&s;ely formed, is founded on e&s;teem, &s;upported with fidelity, &s;anctified by faith, and &s;weetened by mutual &s;ympathy, tru&s;ty and com|placence?</P>
<P N="2">2. I will not attempt to enumerate all the &s;uperior gra|tifications which are forfeited by an irregular life: but &s;urely this is a farther con&s;ideration worthy your regard. Surely a &s;ound mind in a healthful body, moderate de&s;ires, and quiet pa&s;&s;ions, a &s;pirit calm and clear, unob&s;cured by the fumes of intemperance, and undi&s;turbed by the tu|mults of lu&s;t, peaceful and plea&s;ant reflexions on a di&s;creet and honourable conduct, manly, rational, and u&s;eful con|ver&s;ation, the &s;ociety, the applau&s;e, and the patronage of the be&s;t men, the humble, yet triumphant hope of the friend&s;hip of God through every future period, with all the &s;olid and &s;ublime con&s;olations of devotion; &s;urely the&s;e are not things to be ra&s;hly renounced, or lightly e&s;teemed. If you are &s;o unfortunate as to be a &s;tranger to the&s;e things, will it follow that you may boldly contemn, or neglect them? Becau&s;e you are blind, will you take upon you to &s;ay, that light is not &s;weet, or that it is not
<Q>a plea|&s;ant thing for the eyes to behold the &s;un?</Q>
If the&s;e are not ble&s;&s;ings, and ble&s;&s;ings too of ine&s;timable value, why have they been &s;o highly prized, &s;o pathetically re|commended, &s;o ardently &s;ought, &s;o diligently, zealou&s;ly, and per&s;everingly cultivated, by the learnede&s;t, the wi&s;e&s;t, and the greate&s;t men of every age, who have been ready to undertake any thing, to &s;uffer any thing, to &s;acrifice any thing, rather than forego the&s;e &s;weete&s;t and noble&s;t enjoyments? But I will &s;ubmit the que&s;tion to your&s;elf; let your own under&s;tanding judge whether the enjoyments of the mind and of the heart do not bid fair to be the &s;weete&s;t, becau&s;e the noble&s;t. You are a man, and will
<PB N="10" REF="008857_0008_102FF8846DEEAAC0">
you &s;ay, that the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic plea&s;ures of a man, I mean, tho&s;e of rea&s;on, of con&s;cience, and of af|fection, are not better, or more e&s;timable, than the plea|&s;ures of an animal, I mean, tho&s;e of &s;en&s;e and appetite? What? will you give up at once, even in &s;peculation, all the dignity and &s;uperior excellence of your nature, in or|der to ju&s;tify to your&s;elf the deplorable perver&s;ion of your ta&s;te? But in vain do you labour to ju&s;tify it even to your|&s;elf. There is, I know there is, &s;omething within you, that takes part with uncorrupted nature, and reclaims again&s;t the vile abu&s;e. There is &s;omething within you, which tells you, at this very moment, you are unhappy, in having forfeited tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial and &s;acred joys I lately mentioned, for I know not what fanta&s;tic, frivolous, and mean indulgences. I refer the cau&s;e to your mo&s;t inti|mate feelings. Have you not often &s;ecretly &s;ighed to think what you lo&s;t, when you lo&s;t your innocence? When you look back on the lovely, joyous &s;cenes of childhood and early youth, before your mind was debauched and di&s;tempered by guilty plea&s;ures, do you not inwardly wi&s;h you could recal tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed days, at lea&s;t that you could regain the peace and ea&s;e, and gaiety of heart you then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed? When you &s;ee other young per&s;ons of decent characters, and irreproachable morals, chearful, lively, healthy, &s;atisfied in them&s;elves, and beloved by all about them, do not you envy their happy de&s;tiny, and feel on the compari&s;on how mi&s;erable you are? In &s;uch a view, do you not both de&s;pi&s;e and hate your&s;elf at bottom, for the folly and futility of your conduct?</P>
<P>I am &s;ufficiently aware, that amid&s;t your hours of giddy riot, in the circle of your mad companions, you will be fal&s;e enough to di&s;gui&s;e any &s;uch feelings, bold enough to deny even the deepe&s;t convictions of your &s;oul, to boa&s;t what a charming life you lead, and in the height of your pride to talk with pity of the &s;ons of virtue, as a &s;et of poor, gloomy-minded creatures. And pray let us hear
<PB N="11" REF="008857_0009_102FF886D5656EA8">
wherein you have &s;uch mighty advantage over them? Why, you have the plea&s;ure of often getting drunk in the tavern, of frequently revelling in the brothel, perhaps of violating and defiling the marriage-bed, po&s;&s;ibly of &s;educing and ruining credulous innocence, probably of gaming away your own fortune, credit, and peace, or tho&s;e of others whom you call your friends; the plea&s;ure too, no doubt, of laughing at the laws of your country, at the religion of your fathers, at tho&s;e rules of decency and virtue which &s;ober Heathens them&s;elves revere; at all &s;erious men, nay at every body that will not run with you into the &s;ame exce&s;s of riot; and, for aught I know, the plea&s;ure of directly bla&s;pheming him that made you. Great God! what outrages again&s;t nature, &s;ociety, and thee, are daily committed by tho&s;e, who bur&s;ting the bounds thou ha&s;t &s;o wi&s;ely and mercifully &s;et them, rever&s;e the u&s;e of thy creatures, di&s;turb the order of thy world, and having done all they can to deface and de&s;troy the beauty of thy cre|ation, both within and without them, turn at la&s;t their im|pious fury on thy tremendous maje&s;ty! The&s;e, the&s;e are the men, who talk &s;o loud, and &s;o big of plea&s;ure, which they would wholly appropriate to them&s;elves, as if they alone enjoyed and under&s;tood it. But however you may rave, Sirs, in your fits of delirium, we believe your hearts &s;ugge&s;t a different language, in your &s;ober intervals; and &s;ober intervals you will and mu&s;t have. A man cannot be always in the tavern, nor always in the &s;tews, nor al|ways in company: and when he comes to him&s;elf, and is alone, rea&s;on will reflect, and con&s;cience will feel: And would &s;uch a man but &s;peak out his feelings, and his re|flexions, you would find them&mdash;ah how &s;ad! How would you hear him reproach, if not cur&s;e him&s;elf, for the de&s;pe|rate madne&s;s of &s;acrificing to the momentary, muddy, gro&s;s indulgences of a &s;en&s;ual life, which con&s;i&s;t chiefly of a violent agitation of the blood and &s;pirits, which cloy the fancy by repetition, pall more and more every day upon

Are you con&s;cious of no &s;uch unea&s;y feelings or reflexions as the&s;e, you, to whom I am particu|larly addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf on this occa&s;ion? If you are, mu&s;t you not confe&s;s, that the pains which accompany a cour&s;e like yours, though they were no other than tho&s;e of the mind, do far overbalance the plea&s;ures you are &s;o fond of?

Lay your hands upon your hearts, and an&s;wer hone&s;tly. Is it not the &s;evere remembrance of your crimes and di&s;orders, which you wi&s;h to &s;hake off by that expedient? You know it is. And will any man in earne&s;t affirm, that tho&s;e indulgences de&s;erve the ho|nourable name of plea&s;ure, which cannot bear to be calmly reflected on, which rea&s;on will not approve, and on which con&s;cience refu&s;eth to be&s;tow her &s;acred &s;anction?</P>

<P>A young man enters into forbidden paths with a trem|bling &s;tep. The principles of his creation &s;hrink back from the horrors of vice. He reddens at the thought of his fir&s;t deviation from virtue. He yet reveres that hea|venly form. He &s;tarts at the appearance of her worthle&s;s rival. But "beguiled by her much fair &s;peech," to u&s;e the &s;tyle of our in&s;pired author, impelled by the de&s;ire of what is prohibited, in&s;tigated very probably by evil com|panions who have got before him, betrayed by the deceit|fulne&s;s of his heart, working on the &s;implicity of his youth, he ventures forward, he is led on in&s;en&s;ibly, his appetites take fire as he advanceth, his &s;en&s;e of right and wrong becomes le&s;s quick and urgent, con&s;cience is but little heard, and le&s;s regarded, amid&s;t the tumult of company, and the clamour of the pa&s;&s;ions. Its admonitions and re|primands proving officious and trouble&s;ome, as they na|turally will do in this &s;ituation, meet at length with &s;uch unkind reception, and violent oppo&s;ition, that, in many ca&s;es, where it was wont to rai&s;e its awful voice, it cea&s;es very much "to be a reprover." The Syren &s;ong of fal&s;e plea&s;ure, that "prophe&s;ieth &s;moother things," it li&s;tened to with greedy attention. The mo&s;t corrupt and corrupt|ing maxims are collected from every quarter, received with admiration, and entertained with tran&s;port.

Deluded man! how little cau&s;e you have for all this vaunting? pray con&s;ider, and &s;ay in &s;ad truth, whether you de&s;erve &s;o much prai&s;e for a behaviour that degrades your nature, de&s;troys your u&s;efulne&s;s, injures your neighbour, di&s;honours your maker, contradicts the judgment and practice of all the wi&s;e and good, and coun|teracts the conviction of your own mind.

<Q>make you wi&s;er than the bea&s;ts of the field, and teach you more knowledge than the fowls of heaven</Q>
only that you might have it in your power to &s;ink your&s;elf to their level, or rather beneath it? Did he render you capable of the plea&s;ures of knowledge, of goodne&s;s, of piety, only that you might have an opportunity of pre|ferring the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e and pa&s;&s;ion? Did he form you for another world, that you might &s;hew the bravery of neg|lecting it, and the hardine&s;s of &s;acrificing immortal perfection and happine&s;s to a little pre&s;ent, pa&s;&s;ing gratification? I always thought that the voice of honour called men upward, taught them to a&s;pire, promted them to rai&s;e their fame by doing &s;omething great and excellent, and, if po&s;&s;ible, above their &s;tation, rather than below it. But you it &s;eems, would have us to believe it nobler to de&s;cend, and hold it better to live and die, like a bea&s;t, than to climb the a&s;cent of thought and virtue, and by behaving like a man to be|come in due time like an anqel. When you have thus de|ba&s;ed and embruted every divine faculty, will you &s;till lay claim, and on that very account perhaps, to rea&s;on, to re|finement, to &s;uperiority of &s;entiment? What incon&s;i&s;tency, what extravagance is here? But again,</P>
<P N="2">2. Let me remind you, that, by being devoted to &s;en|&s;uality, you de&s;troy your u&s;efulne&s;s and &s;ignificance in life. Your con&s;titution is weakened, if not ruined; your &s;pirit is enervated, if not di&s;&s;olved, and lo&s;t for ever; the native vigour and &s;prightline&s;s of youth are melted down, and ab|&s;orbed in debauchery. That generous ambition, which, beyond any thing on earth, incites to worthy deeds, is ex|tingui&s;hed in low and inglorious indulgences. Study hath little reli&s;h: bu&s;ine&s;s is a burden; application of every kind is in&s;upportable; all is di&s;&s;ipation, debility, indolence, trifling; nothing manly, firm, or re&s;olved remains. Is this the road to real honour? But farther,</P>
<P N="3">3. By per&s;evering in &s;uch a cour&s;e, you cannot fail to be injurious, as well as u&s;ele&s;s to mankind. You are inju|rious by being u&s;ele&s;s. Society has a claim on every man:
<PB N="18" REF="008857_0016_102FF897B6C15D50">
it is entitled to the labour of his head, or of his hands, or both: He is bound to benefit others by his good offices, and to edify them by his good example. Therefore you would be unju&s;t to the world, were you barely to &s;hut your&s;elf up from its intercour&s;e, and to neglect its intere&s;ts. But if, living in it, you act in &s;uch a manner, as directly to hurt the&s;e intere&s;ts, and turn that intercour&s;e into an oc|ca&s;ion of corruption to tho&s;e you conver&s;e with, are you not guilty of a double injury? You not only do no good: you do much harm. You not only deprive the public, and your friends, of that exertion of your powers, and im|provement of your opportunities, for the &s;atisfaction and advantage of both, which they have a right to expect, but which are either wholly ob&s;tructed, or greatly hindered by a di&s;orderly life: you make your&s;elf a downright nui&s;ance in &s;ociety, a daily offence to virtuous men, and a &s;tumbling block to the weak and unwary: you &s;pread infection a|mong&s;t your neighbours and acquaintance, the wor&s;t and deadlie&s;t kind of infection. A man that brings the plague with him, is not half &s;o dangerous. The contagion you propagate kills the &s;ouls, as well as the bodies of tho&s;e it &s;eizeth.</P>
<P>But who can de&s;cribe the mi&s;ery you cau&s;e to tho&s;e, with whom you are mo&s;t nearly connected, and to whom, under God, you owe the greate&s;t obligations? For aught I know, you are born of a re&s;pectable and worthy family, the heir of a plentiful, perhaps of a noble fortune; and when you came into the world, it is very probable, your rejoicing parents ble&s;&s;ed that bounteous providence, which gave them a man-child, and &s;aid to each other,

They &s;pared no pains, they grudged no expence, to form you, as you advanced, to every quality and accompli&s;hment, that might become your birth, adorn your &s;tation, grace your family, delight your friends, and en&s;ure, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, your future utility, reputation and happine&s;s. It may be that, for &s;ome time, you repaid their parential affection and labours, with the &s;tricte&s;t duty and the faire&s;t improvements, by which you &s;till added to their hopes. Gracious Lord! how did their hearts heave with the bigge&s;t emotions of gratitude to thee, and their eyes overflow with tears of unutterable glad|ne&s;s, whil&s;t they beheld that young man in tho&s;e au&s;pici|ous days, &s;etting out in the paths of glory, with an ardour that promi&s;ed the happie&s;t progre&s;s in his after cour&s;e! I would willingly &s;uppre&s;s the &s;equel, but in vain. Yet I need not &s;peak it. The cruel, the killing di&s;appointment I refer to in general, is already pre&s;ent to every imagina|tion, and deeply felt by every &s;en&s;ible nature in this a&s;&s;em|bly.

He may &s;trive to bury and extingui&s;h under the load of intemperance the fire of con&s;cience: but that, like embars raked up under a&s;hes, will bur&s;t out at times, and burn up all the hay and &s;tubble of his vain and fal&s;e confidence, and &s;hew him by its piercing light that he counteracts the conviction of his own Mind, which was,</P>

This indeed is at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;o very plain a point, that it needs little more than to be propo&s;ed. The per&s;ons we are at pre&s;ent concerned with will not di&s;pute, that the cour&s;e they follow is not in general the road to wealth. They will allow that the votaries of plea&s;ure mu&s;t often be content to &s;acrifice their fortunes on her altar; and frequently they even pique them&s;elves on nobly de&s;pi&s;ing, as they are plea&s;ed to ex|pre&s;s it, the &s;ordid con&s;iderations of gain and credit, when the&s;e would interfere with their more elegant gratificati|ons. Now I will not &s;ay that tho&s;e con&s;iderations are of &s;uch value, as to merit being preferred to all others, or made your principal objects. No: I would rather re|mind you, that you were formed for much greater ones, and that the real pro&s;perity of
<Q>a man's life con&s;i&s;teth not in the abundance of the things which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth,</Q>
but in obtaining the proper ends of it, which are nothing le&s;s than the glorifying God, the benefiting men, and the bettering his own immortal &s;pirit. But I would remind you at the &s;ame time, that, in &s;ubordination and &s;ub&s;ervi|ency to the&s;e, reputation and &s;ucce&s;s in bu&s;ine&s;s, a decent competency, or, if it &s;o plea&s;e God, an honorable afflu|ence in life, are very valuable objects, and very worthy of a wi&s;e man's attention. I &s;ay, they are &s;o in a &s;econdary view. In &s;uch a view,
<Q>there is no|thing better,</Q> &s;aith the preacher from the throne, <Q>than for a man to eat and drink, and make his &s;oul en|joy good in his labour: this is from the hand of God.</Q>
The &s;ame great per&s;on mentions it as an encouragement to the &s;tudy of wi&s;dom, or the practice of religion, that length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches "and honor." We are likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured by a chri&s;|tian apo&s;tle, that
<Q>godline&s;s is profitable for all things, having the promi&s;e of the life that now is,</Q>
as well as of "that which is to come." In &s;hort, we are warranted to affirm, that wealth well gotten, enjoyed with gratitude,

May we not conclude then, that tho&s;e who call them&s;elves Men of plea&s;ure are fools, when they laugh at men of bu&s;ine&s;s, or &s;peak with deri&s;ion of the virtuous gentleman, the ho|ne&s;t citizen, or the indu&s;trious farmer, as a &s;et of low, plodding, drudging characters, that know nothing of the value or enjoyment of life? What will tho&s;e arrogant men &s;ay, if poverty &s;hould
<Q>come upon them like an armed man,</Q>
with all the evils it brings along with it, to &s;uch, e&s;pecially, as never felt its gripe before? How will you be able to bear it, ye &s;ons of &s;oftne&s;s;
<Q>you that have lived in plea&s;ure, and nouri&s;hed your hearts as in a day of &s;laughter?</Q>
With what accumulated weight will it fall on you, who&s;e bodies and minds have been enfeebled and pampered with intemperance and &s;loth? With what con&s;ternation, di&s;traction, de&s;pair will it overwhelm you? How will you that are &s;trangers to habits of prudence and application, who perhaps were never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or not tho|roughly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of any one u&s;eful art or talent for bu|&s;ine&s;s, who probably have offended highly your be&s;t friends, and lo&s;t every degree of credit and e&s;timation among the &s;ober part of mankind; how will you be capable of &s;trug|gling with adver&s;ity, and re&s;cuing your&s;elves from it? If di&s;ea&s;e brought upon you by your di&s;orders &s;hould add its pre&s;&s;ure to all the re&s;t, what will you then do? What re|&s;ource then find under con&s;umption of body, joined with con&s;umption of fortune, &s;harpened by &s;o many attendant calamities; and, pray remember, rendered intolerable by angui&s;h of mind, the remor&s;es, the horrors, the hideous images of mi&s;ery pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come, that will ru&s;h like an ho&s;t of enraged enemies upon your tortured brea&s;t?

<PB N="26" REF="008857_0024_102FF8AA2FDC9FE0">
this combination of woes? I think of one, one dreadful re&s;ource. Nature &s;hudders at the black idea. You can imagine what I mean. You have heard, I que&s;tion not, the horrible &s;y&s;tem propo&s;ed, and pleaded for, at your nocturnal orgies. In tho&s;e hours of madne&s;s perhaps you have applauded its patrons, &s;tudied their de&s;perate argu|ments, and at la&s;t adopted an opinion, which in a chri&s;tian land mu&s;t appear to men in their wits &s;hocking to humani|ty, di&s;mal as hell, and daring as its fierce&s;t fiends. This re&s;ource tho&s;e fiends, who &s;port with human wretchedne&s;s, have certainly contrived, to make their prey, in &s;uch ca&s;es, more &s;ure and &s;peedy. May the merciful father forbid, you &s;hould ever fly to that fatal refuge! What a refuge for an immortal being, to plunge him&s;elf with his own hands into the depth of damnation, in order to elude his incumbent mi&s;ery!</P>
<P>But let us turn from the di&s;mal picture, and &s;uppo&s;e in the next place, that a young man addicted to voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s e&s;capes the mi&s;chiefs which often overtake his bre|thren in iniquity, ari&s;ing from a di&s;&s;ipated fortune, a broken reputation, incen&s;ed relations, and a ruined con&s;titution; that he &s;pins out a long life in a &s;tate of external ea&s;e and indulgence, among&s;t a &s;et of people attached to him from different cau&s;es, perhaps fond of him for his parts, his politene&s;s, his vivacity, or his natural goodne&s;s of temper, and that he makes &s;hift to &s;uppre&s;s, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the painful convictions of a &s;elf-condemning mind; need I tell him, that old age will come at la&s;t with its unavoida|ble decrepitude and frailties, and the&s;e not the le&s;s &s;urely for the freedoms he now u&s;eth with his health? This he cannot but know, however he may contrive to overlook it. And when tho&s;e days of darkne&s;s overtake him, which will very probably be many, if a di&s;temper or an accident doth not &s;uddenly &s;nap a&s;under his weakened thread; when he is made "to inherit," as the &s;cripture &s;peaks, "the &s;ins of his youth," and when through the &s;urround|ing
<PB N="27" REF="008857_0025_102FF8AC8795CD90">
gloom he reviews a life lo&s;t in di&s;&s;ipation, and pro&s;ti|tuted to &s;en&s;uality, his talents by which he might have ho|noured God, and profited men, partly neglected, and part|ly abu&s;ed, the remon&s;trances of his friends, the principles of his education, the powerful checks of his own mind, the calls of religion, the warnings of providence, the &s;e|cret workings of God within him, generou&s;ly intended for his recovery to virtue, all the&s;e &s;lighted and oppo&s;ed; how will he bear &s;uch reflexions as the following?
<Q>Now my inglorious and criminal cour&s;e draws near an end; what have I gained by it? A few hours or days of giddy amu&s;ement, and guilty plea&s;ure, often da&s;hed with inward di&s;gu&s;t and bitterne&s;s, always interrupted with long and tedious intervals of in&s;ipidity, languor, and dejection, at be&s;t with &s;cenes of laboured mirth, and forced laughter, that left my heart, as they found it, heavy and &s;ad. I have gained too the boi&s;terous ap|plau&s;e of worthle&s;s and witle&s;s men, like my&s;elf, for ca&s;ting in my lot with them,</Q>
and participating in
<Q>their impiety and debaucheries. I have gained&mdash;nothing more. And what have I lo&s;t? What have I not lo&s;t? My innocence, my honour, my character, my peace of mind, the favour of my maker, the intellectual, the moral, the dome&s;tic, the divine joys, that &s;weeten and dignify exi&s;tence. I have lo&s;t whatever was worth liv|ing for. I have lo&s;t&mdash;my &s;oul. The path I have trod has been marked all along with folly, and vanity, and vexation. A few &s;teps more, and it will land me&mdash; where &mdash; in the place of weeping, where that wretched &s;en&s;uali&s;t lift up his eyes to heaven in vain. For new, alas! it is too late to offer the great Almighty the dregs of a di&s;&s;olute, polluted life, or attempt to van|qui&s;h tho&s;e inveterate habits, which have en&s;laved my &s;oul, and taken away my heart.</Q>
In this mournful period, who, do you think, my brethren, will appear to the man I pant, truly prudent, and truly wi&s;e? The
<PB N="28" REF="008857_0026_102FF8AE0A478FB0">

<P>Once more. Let us follow the unhappy man a little further. Let us figure him at la&s;t laid upon the bed of death, bidding adieu to his &s;orrowful friends, if any friends he hath, rolling his de&s;pairing eyes on every &s;ide. He looks back: his ill-&s;pent youth, and the whole tract of his life pa&s;t, pre&s;ents nothing to his view, but one wild wa&s;te. He looks forward; all, all is wo unutterable. He receives the &s;entence of death within him&s;elf. Nothing now
<Q>re|mains but a fearful looking for of wrath and fiery in|dignation to con&s;ume him.</Q>
I fancy I &s;ee the poor creature ju&s;t about to &s;hoot the irremeable gulph of death, that death he u&s;ed to talk of with &s;uch an affectation of &s;uperior indifference. Oh the &s;hudderings, the &s;trong re|luctance, the unimaginable convul&s;ions that &s;eize his na|ture, as he &s;tands lingering on the tremendous precipice! He wi&s;hes for annihilation, which he often tried to believe in, but could never &s;eriou&s;ly be convinced of. The dread|ful alternative entirely mi&s;gives him. He meditates the devouring aby&s;s of eternity. He recoils, as he eyes it. Alas! alas! how he &s;truggles for life! Impotent efforts all. The re&s;i&s;tle&s;s decree is gone forth. He &s;inks in final de&s;pair. The blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s clo&s;eth round him. He feels him&s;elf undone, without one ray of hope.&mdash; Is this the man, that laughed the children of wi&s;dom and temperance to &s;corn; that admired, extolled, and imitated &s;en&s;uali&s;ts and &s;ots? Is he of the &s;ame opinion, think ye, at the la&s;t? Ah, how different his &s;entiments and language in the bower of plea&s;ure, and on the bed of death!</P>
<P>Did you ever vi&s;it a dying voluptuary? Did you a&s;k him, what were his &s;en&s;ations then?&mdash;
<Q>How do you feel, Sir, in the view of your approaching end? Do you &s;till approve of a voluptuous life? Would you now recom|mend it to tho&s;e about you? Would you lead it again your&s;elf, could health and vigour be re&s;tored?</Q>
How

&s;uch que&s;tions would pain and pierce him! If he uttered his real apprehen&s;ions, with what pathetic, &s;olemn, melting, death-in&s;pired eloquence, would he then expre&s;s his per|fect dete&s;tation of the party he had cho&s;en; would he then declare his heart-rending remor&s;e on that account; would he then pronounce tho&s;e young per&s;ons only wi&s;e, who

<P>Would it be reckoned an un&s;ea&s;onable digre&s;&s;ion from the &s;ubject, or an in&s;upportable addition to this di&s;cour&s;e, were I now at la&s;t to addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e who have more immediately committed to them the care of youth, and to my younger brethren of the clergy who are pre&s;ent?</P>
<P N="1">1. To parents, teachers, tutors, guardians, and ma&s;ters of families. Allow me, my friends, to call on you, with all the concern and &s;olemnity which the importance of the ca&s;e demands, to watch over your re&s;pective charges, as tho&s;e that watch for immortal &s;ouls. To do &s;o is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of the mini&s;ters of religion alone. Think, oh think! of what value and con&s;equence &s;o many young minds mu&s;t naturally be. Think how much will nece&s;|&s;arily depend to them, to you, to &s;ociety, to religion, on the turn they &s;hall take betimes. Think what ri&s;ks they run of taking a bad one, in &s;o en&s;naring an age, e&s;pecially a fatal bias to licentious plea&s;ure. Guard them on that &s;ide with particular vigilance. Be peculiarly &s;ollicitous about the books they read, the company they keep, and the friend&s;hips they form. What effects the&s;e will have upon them, it is ea&s;y to imagine; and &s;hould you neglect them with regard to the&s;e, is there not rea&s;on to fear, that all your be&s;t in&s;tructions and wi&s;e&s;t monitions will be of little avail?

Need I inform you, how delicate a ta&s;k that is, and what judicious attention it will require to prevent or check the irregular fallies of young &s;pirits, without di&s;|gu&s;ting or depre&s;&s;ing them? A form of plea&s;ure mu&s;t needs be exhibited; &s;omething to charm their imaginations, &s;omething to captivate their hearts. The worthier and nobler &s;en&s;ibilities of nature mu&s;t be indulged and culti|vated. A feeling of true honor, the love of virtuous prai&s;e, the admiration of moral beauty, the amiable reci|procations of a refined and generous friend&s;hip, the &s;weet &s;ympathies of natural affection, and dome&s;tic union, all the&s;e mu&s;t be recommended and encouraged.</P>
<P>Above all the re&s;t, a &s;en&s;e of religion mu&s;t be &s;trongly inculcated, as that alone can be the ground-work of every virtue, no le&s;s than its highe&s;t fini&s;hing. But take care how you proceed in your attempts to enforce this divine principle. Beware le&s;t you damp or overlay the minds you de&s;ire to profit. Be &s;ure you &s;et forth religion in all her native &s;miles and graces. Let her never wear, in your di&s;cour&s;e, or manners, a forbidding countenance. That were to di&s;gui&s;e, to mi&s;repre&s;ent the angel, to do her infi|nite wrong, and tho&s;e under your in&s;pection an irrepara|ble injury. Should you frighten them away from piety by making them fancy its &s;pirit gloomy, or feel its exer|ci&s;es, burden&s;ome, they will conceive &s;uch an aver&s;ion to it, as you will never be able to conquer. Whereas if you convince them by all the arts which prudence can prompt, or &s;weetne&s;s &s;ugge&s;t, that there is nothing &s;o beautiful as the character of true goodne&s;s, nothing &s;o delightful as its practice, and &s;hew them in your own temper and behaviour its happy and ornamental influence; you will, by the ble&s;|&s;ing of the Mo&s;t High, which you will ever impore, in&s;pire them with the love of that heavenly power. And when
<PB N="31" REF="008857_0029_102FF8B55AB81A68">
that heavenly power hath taken full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;ouls, where is the phantom of fal&s;e delight, that can have force to &s;educe and detain them?</P>
<P>Expect not however to &s;ee them perfect, or e&s;tabli&s;hed all at once. Require not too much from their tender years. Make candid allowances for the gaity, the giddine&s;s, and little innocent frolics of youth. Remember you were once young. Re&s;train them not from a &s;ober mirth, and decent amu&s;ements &s;uited to their age and &s;tation. Let them plainly perceive that you are plea&s;ed to &s;ee them &s;o, and that you are di&s;po&s;ed to deny them nothing in your power to grant, but what would hurt them. Give no quar|ter to fal&s;ehood, di&s;ingenuity, or bad pa&s;&s;ions of any kind. But let not every trifling folly excite your di&s;plea&s;ure, or provoke your cen&s;ure. Remon&s;trate &s;eldom, and never in wrath, but always with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and great firm|ne&s;s. In fine, if you would give them the mo&s;t valuable proof of your affection, fail not to conduct them to Je&s;us, as the friend, the brother, and the re&s;torer of their natures, who came down from heaven to lead them up thither, and guide their feet in the way of peace and joy, which is no other than the way of wi&s;dom and of holine&s;s. Tell them how much he loves the young, and with what gentlene&s;s "he carries the lambs in his bo&s;om." Cea&s;e not to a&s;&s;ure them, that "his yoke is ea&s;y, and his burden light;" and that, if they will take the&s;e upon them chearfully, bear them &s;teadily, and lean with unbounded confidence on his almighty &s;upport and patronage, all &s;hall be well.

again? It would help, not a little, to leviate the concern which it is natural for me to feel on removing from your &s;ociety, if I might indulge the plea&s;ing idea, that any thing I &s;hall now offer may contribute to your u&s;efulne&s;s, or &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I would begin with ob&s;erving, that the ri&s;ing generation &s;hould be a principal object of your care. From them chiefly mu&s;t ari&s;e your hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in your profe&s;&s;ion. They are not yet
<Q>hardened through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in,</Q>
nor hackneyed in the ways of the world: And being young your&s;elves, you can advi&s;e, admoni&s;h, and reprove them with the be&s;t grace, and the mo&s;t efficacy. Your be&s;towing peculiar notice on them, will always give plea&s;ure to &s;uch as are connected with them, who will, on that account, li&s;ten to your other In&s;tructions with greater advantage. Such as are not &s;o connected will &s;till however approve of your conduct, if they are good: and if they are otherwi&s;e, if they are grown old in iniquity, or
<Q>ac|cu&s;tomed to do evil,</Q>
can you expect
<Q>the Ethiopian &s;hould change his &s;kin, or the Leopard his &s;pots?</Q>
Ne|verthele&s;s you may be a&s;&s;ured, that the very veterans in vice them&s;elves will &s;ecretly applaud your endeavours to train the young to virtue and religion; &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly are they led by the force of truth to admire in &s;peculation tho&s;e venerable forms, which in practice they neglect to pur&s;ue. There is not, I am convinced, in this hou&s;e, a parent, or a tutor &s;o lo&s;t to every &s;entiment of worth, as not to wi&s;h, let their own characters be ever &s;o fooli&s;h or &s;o wicked, that tho&s;e young per&s;ons whom nature or pro|vidence has entru&s;ted to their in&s;pection, may be wi&s;e and virtuous.</P>
<P>When the younger part of your hearers di&s;cover, that they po&s;&s;e&s;s a particular &s;hare in your regard and labours, a di&s;tinction &s;o obliging to them will wonderfully conciliate their e&s;teem and confidence: and the&s;e, under God, will
<Q>open their hearts to attend to the words that &s;hall be
<PB N="33" REF="008857_0031_102FF8BBDC9BD270">
&s;poken</Q> by you.
They will hardly be able to with|&s;tand the arguments, the exhortations, the entreaties, of tho&s;e whom they find &s;o deeply concerned about their edification and welfare; more e&s;pecially if you apply to their ingenuity mainly, or to that &s;en&s;e of truth and pro|bity, of prai&s;e and reputation, which originally belongs to their natures, and which will always afford you a handle, whereby to take hold of their con&s;ciences, unle&s;s the&s;e &s;hould become totally obdurate. And that, it is to be hoped, will rarely be the ca&s;e, &s;o long as they are young. Such a ca&s;e, I am well per&s;uaded, would be yet more rare, if every working of mode&s;ty, every tendency to good, every the &s;malle&s;t &s;hoot or &s;prouting of virtue were early and tenderly cheri&s;hed and &s;upported.</P>
<P>By commending where you can, by rebuking only where you mu&s;t, by never &s;hocking or revolting them with an ill-judged &s;everity, whil&s;t you never fo&s;ter their pride or vanity by unde&s;erved, undi&s;tingui&s;hing, or extravagant applau&s;e, you will pre&s;erve a happy balance in their &s;pi|rits. They will hearken to you with equal delight and reverence, as at once their friends and their teachers. And having thus engaged them to love and honour you, it is natural to think you will the more ea&s;ily and effectually win them to the love and veneratian of your ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>To recommend your ma&s;ter and his religion to their hearts, to all hearts, I need not &s;ay, &s;hould be your ruling ambition, and your leading aim.

<P>Let it always be your care to &s;peak to the heart, to enter into the con&s;cience, to make men ac|quainted with them&s;elves. Contemn every ornament that &s;erves not, in &s;ome &s;hape, to the purpo&s;e of per&s;ua&s;ion, and every &s;pecies of addre&s;s that doth not tend to render

the hearers better or wi&s;er. Never re&s;t in general, or vague harrangues. Such, believe me, how ingenious or elegant &s;oever, are always "from the purpo&s;e of" preaching, a principal part of
<Q>who&s;e end, both at the fir&s;t and now, was and is to hold, as it were, the mirror up to nature, to &s;hew virtue her own feature, vice her own image, and the very age and body of the time its form and pre&s;&s;ure.</Q>
I &s;hall readily be pardoned for applying to this &s;ubject, with a &s;mall variation, tho&s;e beau|tiful words of the greate&s;t human writer in the world.</P>
<P>I conjure you, brethren,
<Q>before God, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;hall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his kingdom;</Q>
never &s;acrifice utility or truth to &s;hew or popularity. Let no de&s;ire of applau&s;e tempt you to &s;poil your di&s;cour&s;es with af|fected rhetoric or vain philo&s;ophy, on the one hand, or to di&s;grace them with vulgarity and cant, on the other. Let no dread of bigots, however violent or numerous, de|ter you from holding up to the people a high &s;tandard of chri&s;tian morals. Let no re&s;pect for libertines, of what rank or parts &s;oever, turn you a&s;ide from the &s;implicity of "the truth, as it is in Je&s;us." A virtuous chri&s;tianity, that is, genuine chri&s;tianity, is the cau&s;e of heaven. It will always bear you out. If you have felt its &s;acred operation, are taken with its beauty, and awed by that maje&s;ty which it hath derived from its author, ble&s;&s;ed Saviour! what fortitude and fervour in preaching it will the&s;e in&s;pire!</P>
<P>If indeed you have undergone the di&s;cipline of re|pentance, if you have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;trait gate, and entered the narrow way, that lead to life eternal, if the pro&s;pects which faith unfolds have opened on your illuminated eye, and that cele&s;tial &s;pirit who proceeds from Je&s;us has de&s;|cended into your bo&s;oms; what force of feeling, what depth of di&s;cernment in the be&s;t things, what unction of &s;entiment and language, what un&s;tudied allurement and
<PB N="37" REF="008857_0035_102FF8C58F09EA20">
dignity of manner, will ordinarily accompany your per|formances! How clearly will you trace, and how &s;en&s;i|bly de&s;cribe, from the fund of your own experience, the movements of the &s;oul, the mea&s;ures of con&s;cience, the &s;alutary pains of conver&s;ion, the &s;ecret &s;truggles of virtue, the a&s;pirations of an advancing piety, in &s;hort, the whole ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the divine life!</P>
<P>Let me particularly remind you, that nothing will more a&s;&s;i&s;t or animate you in the exerci&s;es of the pulpit, than the devotions of the clo&s;et; provided the&s;e are are hum|ble and liberal, &s;imple and exalted, &s;erious and fervent. In that ca&s;e, they will be &mdash; what will they be &mdash; a rich, perennial &s;pring of in&s;piration. They will duffu&s;e through your public addre&s;&s;es, both to God and to man, a certain ethereal influence, that will be univer&s;ally &s;een and felt. Oh, how different from the con&s;traint, the for|mality, the frigidity, the deadne&s;s, you have &s;ometimes witne&s;&s;ed!</P>
<P>After all, let it be remembered, that the benediction of God alone can give proper power to all your mini|&s;trations. I hope you daily a&s;k it. But remember like|wi&s;e, you can only expect it, in the road of righteou&s;ne&s;s. And therefore to all your improvements, and all your exertions, fail not (I will take the liberty to &s;ay it to the whole order pre&s;ent), fail not to join purity of heart and &s;anctity of manners. Practi&s;e as much as po&s;&s;ible the breeding of gentlemen; but never drop the character of clergymen. Between the&s;e, when truly under&s;tood, there is, I am per&s;uaded, no incompatibility. But if there were, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee which of the two, in point of pro|priety and uniformity, ought to give place in your de|portment. An engaging demeanour, it is certain, can never be incon&s;i&s;tent with clerical decorum. But where|ever the fa&s;hion of the times, or the folly of men would attempt to build either plea&s;ure or refinement on the ruins of virtue, may we have the firmne&s;s in
<PB N="38" REF="008857_0036_102FF8C7E3097B80">
our behaviour, to &s;ink the man of the world in the man of God.
<Q>Finally, brethren, farewell: be per|fect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace &s;hall be with you.</Q>
Amen.</P>
