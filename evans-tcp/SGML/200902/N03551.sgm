<P>_WE have in this Chapter an ac|count of Five Miracles wro't by the hand of <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> the Pro|phet. It is the Second of 'em only that will fall under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration, namely, <HI>That of his obtaining the Ble&s;&s;ing of a Son for an Ancient Couple who had been long Childle&s;s.</HI> The Hi&s;tory of which begins at Ver 8. <HI>It fell on a day, that Eli&s;ha pa&s;&s;ed to Shu|nem, where was a great woman; and &s;he con&s;trained him to eat bread. And &s;o it was as oft as he pa&s;&s;ed by, be turned in thither to eat bread.</HI> In the
<PB N="2" REF="004338_0004_10044876AA9DBAA0">Ver&s;es following, we have an account of the Kindne&s;s of this great woman to the Prophet, who not only (with the leave of her Husband) hid him Welcome to her Hou&s;e, and the En|tertainment of it; but &s;he provides a Lodging room for him, whether he was wont fre|quently to turn in, when in his Circuit he pa&s;&s;ed that way, <HI>Ver.</HI> 9, 10, 11.</P>
<P>The holy Man in gratitude for this Kind|ne&s;s, con&s;ults what Recompence he &s;hould make her (for Religion and Grace teach men gratitude.) He offers to u&s;e his Intere&s;t for her at the King's Court; but &s;he needs not this Favour, <HI>ver</HI> 13. Well, he con&s;ulteth his Servant <HI>Gehazi,</HI> what &s;hall be done for her, wherein he may Oblige her? Who tells his Ma&s;ter, That &s;he is Childle&s;s; hath a great E&s;tate, but no Son to Heir it, <HI>ver.</HI> 14 The Prophet then &s;ends for her, and promi&s;es her &s;he &s;hall have a Son; which was a great &s;ur|prize to her; but was fulfilled at the exact ap|pointed time, Ver. 15,&mdash;17. <HI>The woman con|ceived, and bare a &s;on at that &s;ea&s;on that Eli&s;ha had &s;aid unto her, according to the time of life.</HI> This no doubt was great Joy to the Family when the Heir was born. And after the Birth of this their Son, the Prophet no doubt was doubly welcome to the Parents; and the Child, no doubt was dear to the Prophet, as being a Son of his Prayers; and to the Parents, as being
<PB N="3" REF="004338_0005_1004414E18FC2DE0">the Son of their Old Age, and an only Son: But as dear as he was to them all, he was not too dear for Death. For now being big eno' ju&s;t to run abroad, he follows his Father into the Field; where either the Coldne&s;s of the Earth, or Heat of the Sun in harve&s;t-time over|came the Child, that was tenderly bred; and he complains to his Father that his Head akes; who &s;ends him home to his Mother, not &s;u&s;pecting him to be dangerou&s;ly Ill; where he lay in his Mothers Arms till Noon and then died, <HI>ver</HI> 18, &mdash;20.</P>
<P>But &s;he (in&s;tead of &s;ending for her Neigh|bours to lay out her dead Child) retires into the little Chamber and lays him on the Pro|phet's Bed; then goes out, &s;hutting the door after her, and runs into the Field to her Hu&s;|band, not to acquaint him with the &s;orrowful News, but to beg leave of him to go to the Prophet: He (after &s;ome Objections) gives her Leave; which &s;he having obtained and a Servant to wait on her, makes all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to the Prophet, with an heart full eno' of grief, Tho' &s;he behaved &s;o excellently under it, and makes no more di&s;covery of it. The Prophet &s;eeing her coming, for whom he had &s;o great a Re&s;pect, &s;endeth his Servant <HI>Gehazi</HI> to En|quire whether any thing was ami&s;s with her, or her Family? As in the Text, <HI>Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and &s;ay unto her, Is it well
<PB N="4" REF="004338_0006_1004487B4CC55920">with thee? Is it well with thy Husband? Is it well with the Child? And &s;he an&s;wered, It is well.</HI></P>
<P>Here we have,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>The Que&s;tion which the Prophet by his Servant put to her, which is very particular, Is it well with thee with thy Husband &amp; with the Child? Is all well with thy Family?</HI> Thus it becomes the men of God, to Enquire of the welfare of their People with a tender concern to know how it fares with their Families, and with their Souls; how Religion flouri&s;heth among them, and what is to be done for them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>The Reply that &s;he makes to this Que&s;tion. And &s;he an&s;wered, It is well. "Gebazi</HI> was not the man &s;he came to complain to, and therefore &s;he turns him off with this general An&s;wer, <HI>It is well.</HI> However, this &s;he &s;peaks very &s;eri|ou&s;ly, as a pious and good Woman: And there is much in the An&s;wer; It manife&s;ts the ex|cellent temper of her Mind, her quiet Re&s;ig|nation to the Providence of God, and her Faith that all &s;hould be well in the Conclu&s;ion. It is well with me: Tho' I am &s;orely bereaved and afflicted, Yet 'tis what God hath done, and what he doeth is well, and &s;hall be well; and he can make it well to me, and well to my Husband. <HI>'Tis well with me, and well with my Husband; yea, and it is well with the Child too.</HI> Tho' the Child now lay dead in the Hou&s;e. This &s;aying of hers, was not the Effect of her
<PB N="5" REF="004338_0007_10044905F14651A0">&s;tupidity, as tho' &s;he was in&s;en&s;ible of the Aw|fulne&s;s of the Providence, or didn't &s;ufficiently feel her Lo&s;s. No, It appears by the Ver&s;es following, that her Soul was full eno' of An|gui&s;h; nor could a Mothers Bowels be more rent, than hers were; <HI>for her Soul was vexed within her,</HI> Ver 27. But it was her Grace and Faith that made her thus quiet and re&s;igned, and cau&s;ed her to carry it &s;o excellent well under &s;o heavy and &s;hocking a Di&s;pen&s;ation, as the lo&s;s of her dear and only Son, and the Son of her old Age, when &s;he could not expect another: Yet &s;he could (and that very &s;eri|ou&s;ly and well con&s;i&s;tent with her duty) &s;ay, It is well; 'tis well with me, and well with my Husband, tho' our all be taken from us; and it is well with the Child too, tho' it be dead.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The general Ob&s;ervation or Doctrinal Point may be this,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">That when God removes our deare&s;t Relations out of the World by Death, it becomes us in quiet Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to the divine Providence, to &s;ay, It is well both with us and with them. &mdash; <HI>And &s;he an&s;wered, It is well.</HI></HEAD>
<P>And it is ju&s;t ground of Comfort when we can &s;ay this in <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope,</HI> as &s;he did.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004338_0008_10044882226651F8">
The Doctrine may be &s;poken to under the Three following Propo&s;itions, Namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM>PROP. I. <HI>That our deare&s;t Relations, and we too, are Mortal, and mu&s;t be Remov'd out of the World by Death.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. II. <HI>That when any are Removed out of the World by Death, 'tis divine Providence that orders the Time, and all the Circum&s;tances of their Removal.</HI> Hence,</ITEM>
<ITEM>PROP. III. <HI>When our deare&s;t Relations are &s;o Removed, it becomes us in quiet Submi&s;&s;ion to the divine Providence, to &s;ay it is well both with us and with them.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>That our deare&s;t Relations, and we too, are Mortal, and mu&s;t be Removed out of the World by Death.</HI></P>
<P>This is a Truth no le&s;s certain, than it is awful; which tho' it cannot be too much tho't of by us, yet needs little to be &s;aid for the proof of it. All grant this Truth. Every one knows that he mu&s;t die, Eccl. ix. 5. <HI>For the living know that they &s;hall die.</HI> And there is a Statute Law of Heaven for it, Heb. ix. 27. <HI>Is is appointed to man once to die.</HI> And the royal Preacher a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>That this is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart,</HI> Eccl. vii. 2 Our dear Relatives, in whom we enjoy the greate&s;t Comfort, are Mortal and mu&s;t die.
<PB N="7" REF="004338_0009_10044154909627A0"><HI>There they buried Abraham &amp; Sarah his wife, there they buried I&s;aac and Rebecca his wife, and there I buried Leah,</HI> Gen. xlix. 31. Friends are precious Comforts, yet they are fading Comforts too, that we can't Enjoy always. We and they mu&s;t have our parting time. Children are plea&s;ant Flowers in our Eyes; but we mu&s;t remember that they are but fading Flowers, that Death may &s;oon turn into a lump of cold Clay and make us willing to bury them out of our fight. And we &s;hould remember that the&s;e dear Comforts may &s;uddenly be remov'd from us, as it was with the Child referr'd to in our Text: Well with his Father in the Mor|ning, yet dead with his Mother at Noon. And as &s;udden may our own Deaths be. We know not at what Watch our Lord and Ma&s;ter may call for us. How highly then does it concern us to make it our fir&s;t and great care to be al&s;o ready. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is that &s;ervant whom when his Lord cometh he &s;hall find &s;o doing,</HI> Mat. xxiv. 46.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>When any are Removed out of the World by Death, it is divine Providence that orders the Time &amp; all the Circum&s;tances of their Removal.</HI></P>
<P>Here it may briefly be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the preci&s;e Time of every per&s;ons Death, is Pre-determined in the divine Coun&s;el or Decree; is that whatever of Contingency may &s;eem to attend
<PB N="8" REF="004338_0010_10044883DA4A7800">the Death of any, as to Time, Place, In&s;truments, Cau&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>yet with re&s;pect to the divine Decree, there can be no &s;uch thing.</HI> The exact time of every per&s;ons Death being fore-known, ap|pointed &amp; fixed in the divine Fore knowlege and Decree, to a very moment; and therefore &s;hall come at the exact Time, but cannot pa&s;s it. <HI>It there not an appointed time to man upon Earth? Are not his days al&s;o like the days of an Hireling?</HI> Job vii 1. He that is hir'd, indents for a certain determinate Time, the period of which is exactly fixed. So long he can be held and no longer. So <HI>Job</HI> tells us it is with re&s;pect to the Date of humane Life. Every one hath his exact number of Years, Months, Days and Hours appointed him to fulfil in the World. And thus far he mu&s;t come, and no further: <HI>Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee: Thou ha&s;t appointed his Bounds that he cannot pa&s;s,</HI> Chap. xiv. 5. Yea, before the Child is born, it is appointed and determined ju&s;t how long it &s;hall live, and its Bounds are fix'd; which is equally Decreed in the divine Coun&s;els and Fore-knowlege with its Birth. Hence we read, That <HI>to every thing there is a Sea&s;on and a Time</HI> (That is, Pre|determined, Appointed and Fixed in the divine Decree) <HI>to every purpo&s;e under Heaven. A time to be Born, and a time to Die,</HI> Eccl. iii. <HI>beg.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="9" REF="004338_0011_1004490DB62E6068">
2. <HI>The Providence of God orders all the Second Cau&s;es &amp; the Circum&s;tances of them, by which every one is bro't unto Death in his exact appointed time. For I know</HI> that <HI>thou wilt bring me unto death, and to the hou&s;e appointed for all living,</HI> Job xxx 23. <HI>Thou</HI> wilt bring me unto death: For whatever be the In&s;trument, whatever be the Means by what the Effect is bro't about, God's Providence is the chief Efficient: At the Ordering and under the &s;pecial Direction of which, every thing is Effected. And God by his Providence performs that, and that only which was appoin|ted, and in the appointed time &amp; method. That tho&s;e Effects which with re&s;pect to Second Cau&s;es were mo&s;t contingent, yet with re&s;pect to the Fir&s;t Cau&s;e of all, are no more than what were long before determined on and ap|pointed. So that as <HI>Job</HI> tells us, The thing that God accompli&s;heth in his Providence, is the &s;ame and no other than what was before fix'd and determined on in the Decree. Chap. xxiii. 14. <HI>For He performeth</HI> the thing that is <HI>ap|pointed for me, and many &s;uch things are with him.</HI> And if as our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour tells, the very Hairs of our head are &s;o numbred (in the di|vine Decree or Coun&s;el) as that not one of them can fall to the ground, without the order|ing of divine Providence; then much more our Deaths &amp; all the Circum&s;tances attending them, are certainly at the Ordering and under the
<PB N="10" REF="004338_0012_1004411667B5AA28">Direction of divine Providence. It follows then, that when any are removed out of the world by Death, divine Providence hath Or|dered the Time, and all the Circum&s;tances at|tending their Removal.</P>
<P>Hence,</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>When our deare&s;t Relations are &s;o Remov'd, it becomes us in quiet Submi&s;&s;ion to the di|vine Providence, to &s;ay, It is well both with us and with them.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Language of that excellent, ver|tuous and pious Woman in our Text, under a very &s;ore and &s;udden Bereavement. Her only Son and only Child, a Child of Promi&s;e and a Child of Prayer, and a Child of Old Age, and given her in Love; and yet taken away by a &s;udden Death, Well in the Morning, and dead by Noon; and died in her Arms: All her care, tenderne&s;s and Prayers cannot keep it alive, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Henry</HI> in loc.</NOTE> The &s;troke is very heavy. Yet how admirably doth the pious Mother keep her temper, and govern her &s;pirit under this mo&s;t &s;urprizing Af|fliction! Not one peevi&s;h or indecent word comes out of her mouth; but her &s;peech and behaviour manife&s;ts a humble Re&s;ignation to the divine Providence. And Excellent Pattern for Chri&s;tian Imitation! And when the Pro|phet
<PB N="11" REF="004338_0013_10044161611C45C8">by his Servant puts that Que&s;tion to her, Is <HI>it well with thee? Is it well with thy Husband?</HI> Is <HI>it well with the Child? She an&s;wered,</HI> It is <HI>Well</HI> <ABBR>qd</ABBR> It is well with me, It is well with my Husband, &amp; it is well with the Child. This is the Language of her quiet Submi&s;&s;ion to the Providence of God, Acknowledging that all is well that He doth; and of her Faith, That all &s;hould be well in the Conclu&s;ion. And &s;urely &s;he &s;pake right in this. And it is (no doubt) written for our Learning, and does teach us a like Submi&s;&s;ion and humble Patience under the afflicting hand of God, when in like for bereaved of dear Relatives. This &s;hould be the Language of our humble Re&s;igna|tion, It is well with us, and it is well with them. Thus he, 1 Sam. iii. 18 <HI>And be &s;aid, It is the Lord: let him do what &s;eemeth him good.</HI></P>
<P>But here will ari&s;e Two important Enqui|ries, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<ITEM>Que&s;t, 1. <HI>In what &s;en&s;e may, and ought we to &s;ay, It is well with us, when our dear Friends are Removed from us by Death?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Que&s;t 2. <HI>In what &s;en&s;e may we &s;ay, It is well with our departed Friends when &s;o Removed?</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t Enquiry then is, <HI>In what &s;en&s;e may, and ought we to &s;ay, It is well with us, when our dear Friends are Removed from us by Death?</HI></P>
<P>This Que&s;tion mu&s;t be an&s;wered, fir&s;t Nega|tively, and then Po&s;itively.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004338_0014_1004489017A1BE60">
<HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. <HI>Negatively.</HI> We mu&s;tn't under&s;tand this A&s;&s;ertion in our Doctrine, as tho' Religion and Grace remov'd the Bonds of Nature, or taught us le&s;s to value the Lives of our Friends, or to make light of their Death; or taught us not to Mourn their Removal. No, Nothing like Religion and Grace to make men tender-hearted, compa&s;&s;ionate, full of love &amp; goodne&s;s to their Friends. So that that Phra&s;e, <HI>It is well with us when our dear Friends are removed from us,</HI> mu&s;t not be otherwi&s;e under&s;tood, but that,</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>Such Afflictions are in them&s;elves Evils, and as &s;uch are to be Re&s;ented.</HI> No Evil in it &s;elf con&s;idered, is to be cho&s;en; nor can we &s;ay of it, <HI>It is well.</HI> Afflictions in them&s;elves con&s;ider'd, are the fruits and effects of Sin, and as &s;uch are not to be cho&s;en, but deprecated. The Remo|val of dear Friends is a great lo&s;s; the affliction is great. and as &s;uch cannot be cho&s;en. Nor can we &s;ay of it without &s;in, That it is well we have lo&s;t them: Which would be the mo&s;t mon&s;trous Inhumanity. Religion don't teach us to ca&s;t off Natural Affection; which to do is very &s;inful, and an horrid violation of the Law of Nature; for which the Gentiles &s;tand In|dicted &amp; Condemned by the Apo&s;tle, Rom i. 31 <HI>Without Natural affection, Implacable, &V;nmerciful.</HI></P>
<P>Hence,</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>It can't in'end but that we ought to Mourn our lo&s;s in their Removal.</HI> Grief is Natural, and
<PB N="13" REF="004338_0015_1004491819F1A1D0">never more &s;o, than on &s;uch &s;orrowful Occa|&s;ions. And tho' natural Affection is ever to be govern'd by Rea&s;on and Religion, and to be kept within due Bounds, that we be not ex|ce&s;&s;ive in our Mourning (for Exce&s;s in any thing is Sinful) Yet we are never to act con|trary to Humanity, as tho&s;e do who Mourn not the death of their dear Friends. So the royal Teacher exhorts, <HI>My &s;on, de&s;pi&s;e not the cha&s;tning of the Lord, neither be weary of his cor|rection,</HI> Prov. iii. II. Not to be affected with &s;uch Afflictions, not to lay to heart &s;uch Be|reavements, nor to be awaken'd by them, is to de&s;pi&s;e the Cha&s;tning of the Lord here for|bidden. 'Tis with <HI>Ephraim</HI> to bear Afflictions as a Bullock unaccuftom'd to the Yoke. We mu&s;t not (&s;aith Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>) be Stocks and Stones and Stoicks under our Afflictions; in|&s;en&s;ible of them, without feeling under them, or unmindful of the Errand on which they are &s;ent. We mu&s;t not thus de&s;pi&s;e the Cha&s;tning of the Lord. Tho' on the other hand, We mu&s;t take heed that we don't faint under them; that we be not di&s;pirited, nor run into Exce&s;s and &s;uffer our &s;elves to be unfitted for duty by our Afflictions.</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>It does not intend but that there may be the righteous Di&s;plea&s;ure of God in &s;uch Afflictions; which ought to be very humbling to us.</HI> On this account, &s;uch frowns of Providence appear aw|ful,
<PB N="14" REF="004338_0016_10044896A0514120">as there may be the di&s;plea&s;ure of God di&s;|cern'd in them. Then &s;urely, on this account we cannot &s;ay, <HI>It is well.</HI> It is not well, but aw|ful that we &s;hould offend our Maker, &amp; expo&s;e our &s;elves to his Frowns and righteous Di&s;|plea&s;ure; making divine Cha&s;ti&s;ements need|ful for us; on which account we have rea&s;on to walk &s;oftly under Afflictions and greatly to humble our &s;elves before God, making that humble Petition <HI>Job</HI> does, Chap. X. ver. 2. <HI>I will &s;ay unto God, Do not condemn me; &s;hew me wherefore thou contende&s;t with me.</HI> And we ought to improve all for the promoting our Repen|tance &amp; future Amendment. So <HI>Elihu</HI> advi&s;es <HI>Job,</HI> Chap. xxxiv. 31, 32. <HI>Surely it is meet to be &s;aid unto God, I have born</HI> Cha&s;ti&s;ement, <HI>I will not offend</HI> any more.</P>
<P>But thus far in a Negative way, to keep us from mi&s;takes is what follows. I now pa&s;s on to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>And Po&s;uively.</HI> That we may and ought, in a quiet Submi&s;&s;ion to the divine Providence, to &s;ay, <HI>It is well with us, when our dear Friends are removed from us by Death; or when under the exerci&s;e of any Affliction.</HI> And that on the fol|lowing accounts e&s;pecially, Namely,

<P>USE, I. <HI>From what hath been offer'd under the Doctrine, &s;ee &s;omething of the Excellency of our holy Religion, that gives us &s;uch hope in Death, and affords us &s;uch Directions &amp; Con&s;olation in Mour|ning the Death of godly Friends.</HI> The Phile&s;o|pless &amp; wife Sages of the <HI>Gentile</HI> world taught men to bear Lo&s;&s;es and Afflictions patiently, from the con&s;ideration of inevitable Fate; and that it was unrea&s;onable &amp; unmanly to mourn
<PB N="33" REF="004338_0035_10044945C0D702F8">or grieve at that which man cou'd not help. Poor foundation of Comfort! Yet as good as any of the Religions of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> teacheth. But our holy Religion teacheth us to comfort our &s;elves under Afflictions, from the Con&s;ide|ration that our real Felicity does not con&s;i&s;t in the Favour and Smiles, nor our Mi&s;ery in the Frowns &amp; Cro&s;&s;es of this World. It teacheth, A man may be Poor in this world, yet exceed|ing Rich, rich in Faith. Low and de&s;pi&s;ed in this world, yet Heir of a Crown and Kingdom. That a man may be him&s;elf ju&s;t ground of Comfort and &s;olid Joy. <HI>For the&s;e light Afflictions that are but for a moment,</HI> if &s;anctified by Grace, will be <HI>working for us a far more exceeding &amp; an eternal weight of Glory.</HI> So that under the heavie&s;t Trials, good Chri&s;tians may &s;ay, <HI>It is well with us &s;till.</HI> For all the&s;e things &s;hall work toge|ther for good to &s;uch, and &s;hall in the conclu|&s;ion turn to their account.</P>
<P>In a word, Our holy Religion opens to the Eye of Faith another World, an Eternal Ex|i&s;tence after this &s;hort Life; and teaches us that it is well with us or with our Friends, or ill with us or them, as it is like to fare with us or them in the next World; to which this world and the affairs of it bear no proportion. If therefore we have good ground of hope for them that are gone, this will teach us that it is
<PB N="34" REF="004338_0036_10044137C1745850">infinitely better with them now than when they were here? That they cannot wi&s;h them|&s;elves with us again.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Becau&s;e Christianity teaches us, Never to look upon the Death of our godly Friends as the Lo&s;s of them; but only as their Removal out of a world of Trouble into a glorious Re&s;t, and to Mourn for them accordingly.</HI> Prov. xiv. 32. &mdash; <HI>The righteous hath hope in his death.</HI> I The&s; iv. 14. <HI>For if we be|lieve that Je&s;us died, and ro&s;e again even &s;o them

No. we may at lea&s;t weep for our &s;elves, if not for them; weep for our lo&s;s, tho' that may be their great gain. But yet, Chri|&s;tianity teaches us to be moderate and rational in our Sorrows: Becau&s;e to be Exce&s;&s;ive on &s;uch awful occa&s;ions, looks as if we had no hope. It is to act like the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who have no hope of a better Life after this to moderate their Sorrows for their Dead, whom they look upon as quite lo&s;t. Whereas we <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> that have a mo&s;t &s;ure hope of a glorious State after this (which is infinitely better than to be here, and who believe our godly Friends departed, to be gone to this glorious Re&s;t re&s;erved for the People of God in another world, where is ful|ne&s;s of Joy &amp; Plea&s;ures evermore) ought never to Mourn their removal as tho' they were lo&s;t, or as tho' we didn't expect to &s;ee them again with more &s;atisfaction than ever in this world, or as tho' they were not now infinitely more happy than they could be with us here.

Be&s;ides, when &s;uch Fruitful Chri&s;tians are taken away, the Provi|dence carries a warning A&s;pect in it, e&s;pecially to the Carele&s;s and Secure, who may well re|ceive it as a Warning to them. 1 Pet. iv. 17. <HI>For the time</HI> is come <HI>that judgment mu&s;t begin at the hou&s;e of God; and i</HI> it <HI>fir&s;t</HI> begin <HI>at us, what &s;hall the End</HI> be <HI>of them that obey not the go&s;pel of God?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>[2] <HI>Suffer me to mind you of your Duty to your Reverend Pa&s;tor, under his pre&s;ent melancholy Cir|cum&s;tances.</HI> That you do all that you can to Comfort him; and by your kind Offices to A&s;&s;i&s;t him under the pre&s;ent broken Circum|&s;tances of his Family. <HI>To him that is afflicted pity</HI> &s;hould be &s;hewed <HI>from his friend,</HI> Job vi. 14. The afflicted &s;tate of your Pa&s;tor be&s;peaks your Compa&s;&s;ions in the words of <HI>Job,</HI> Chap xix 21

<P N="2">2. <HI>The &s;econd &amp; la&s;t Branch of the Exhortation, is, To all, That you would &s;o improve the&s;e Truths and live &s;uch a life of Vertue &amp; Piety, as that when you &s;hall go the way of all Fle&s;h, you may leave behind you tho&s;e comfortable Evidences of your good State, which may give your &s;urviving Friends occa&s;ion to &s;ay, to their Comfort &amp; the honour of your Name,
<PB N="46" REF="004338_0048_100449748BC09F08">It is well with them;</HI> as in the Text. And in order to this,</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>Con&s;ider, what your pre&s;ent State is, and how you Live.</HI> Is your State &s;uch as would be &s;afe for you to Die in? Had the late Summons of Death been for you, had it found you prepar'd? Had you been at re&s;t in <HI>Abram</HI>'s bo&s;om? Think now of this matter &s;eriou&s;ly. Which of us mu&s;t next follow, God only knows. We had need give diligence to be Ready. Have you then made your Peace with God, and obtain'd the comforts of a Pardon? Have you indeed been &s;o convinc'd of Sin, of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and of Judgment, as that it hath bro't you to throw down your weapons of Rebellion, &amp; to come in &amp; &s;ubmit your&s;elves intirely to the grace &amp; au|thority of the Go&s;pel? Have you indeed clos'd with a Saviour, and receiv'd the Atonement?</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> Do you indeed live a Chri&s;tian life, a life of Faith &amp; Repentance, of Devotion and Charity? Review your pa&s;t conduct, What hath your Conver&s;ation been? Has it been in <HI>Sim|plicity &amp; godly Sincerity?</HI> Or havn't you rather been <HI>indulging your Appetires, Lu&s;ts &amp; Pa&s;&s;ions in exorbitant &amp; &s;inful Practi&s;es?</HI> If you have indulg'd your &s;elves in Ea&s;e and carnal Security, then what is your State? Suffer me to deal plainly, If you have liv'd in the &s;inful neglect of &s;ome Duties, and in the carele&s;s performance of o|thers; if in the neglect of Family or Secret
<PB N="47" REF="004338_0049_1004495CF8F4B810">Prayer, or both; or if you attend the&s;e but in a formal, cu&s;tomary manner, without a heart, will not this Evidence you to be in a gracele&s;s State? And then how can you think of Death and Judgment, without amazement? Do any live in <HI>Intemperate Practi&s;es,</HI> in <HI>Pride, Wantonne&s;s and Profanene&s;s, in Revellings and Contentions; for which things &s;ake, the wrath of God cometh on the children of Di&s;obedience.</HI> And are not &s;uch <HI>E|nemies to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t?</HI> What then is your condition? Phil. iii. 18, 19. <HI>For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you weeping,</HI> That they are <HI>the enemies of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t; who&s;e end</HI> is <HI>de&s;truction, who&s;e god</HI> is <HI>their belly, and who&s;e glory is in their &s;hame, who mind earthly things.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2) and to Conclude, <HI>Be advi&s;ed to be thorough in the great bu&s;ine&s;s of your Souls.</HI> Don't Tri&s;le in bu&s;ine&s;s of the la&s;t moment. Your Souls &amp; the Redemption of them is precious. If the Soul be Lo&s;t, there is nothing can Compen&s;ate for the Lo&s;s of it. <HI>For what &s;hall it pro|fit a man, if he &s;hall gain the whole world &amp; lo&s;e his own &s;oul? or what &s;hall a man give in exchange for his &s;oul?</HI> Mark viii. 36, 37. Your turn al&s;o will come to Die, and who knows how &s;oon? <HI>For what is your life? It is even as a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vani&s;heth away,</HI> Jam. iv. 14. Give diligence then to be Ready. And as you would be &s;o, &s;ee to it that you be Converted; That a Saving Change do pa&s;s upon you. Without this you vainly hope to enter into the King|dom of God. Then improve <HI>your Time</HI> with Dili|gence; Work while&s;t <HI>the Day lasts.</HI> Make your Calling &amp; Election &s;ure, <HI>For &s;o an Entrance &s;hall be admini&s;tred to you abundanily into the Everla&s;ting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 2 Pet. i. 11.</P>
