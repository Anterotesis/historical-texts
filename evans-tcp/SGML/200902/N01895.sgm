<P>&sect; 1. _IT is the Concern of every one that would enjoy <HI>Tranquillity</HI> in this World, or obtain <HI>Felicity</HI> in the World to come, to fol|low that Holy Direction of Hea|ven, <HI>Exerci&s;e thy &s;elf in PIETY.</HI> And there is no <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of PIE|TY more unexceptionable than that of <HI>making a Joyful</HI> Noi&s;e of SINGING in the Prai&s;es of our GOD; That of &s;ignifying our <HI>Delight</HI> in Divine <HI>Truths</HI> by SINGING of them; That of <HI>Uttering</HI> the Sentiments of Devotion, with the <HI>Voice,</HI> and &s;uch a <HI>Modulation of the Voice,</HI> as will naturally expre&s;s the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> and <HI>Elevation</HI> of the <HI>Mind,</HI> which a Grave SONG &s;hall be expre&s;&s;ive of. 'Tis indeed a very <HI>Ancient Way</HI> of Glorifying the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD; As <HI>Ancient</HI> as the Day <HI>when the Foundations of the Earth were fa&s;tened,</HI> and <HI>the Corner-Stone thereof was laid.</HI> The
<PB N="2" REF="002241_0007_0FDAD6964BF8E160"><HI>Morning-Stars</HI> then <HI>Sang together.</HI> And it is as <HI>Exten|&s;ive</HI> an one; For it is Remarkable, That <HI>All Nations</HI> make SINGING to be one part of the <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> which they pay unto their GOD. Tho&s;e Few <HI>Untuned Souls,</HI> who affect upon Principle to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the re&s;t of Mankind, by the Character of <HI>Non-Singers,</HI> do &s;eem too much to dive&s;t them&s;elves of an <HI>Humanity,</HI> whereof it may be &s;aid unto them, <HI>Doth not Nature it &s;elf teach it you?</HI> Be &s;ure, they &s;ufficiently differ from the <HI>Primitive Chri&s;tians;</HI> For, though the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Churches were at fir&s;t Superiour to the <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> for the <HI>Zeal of the Hou&s;e of GOD</HI> in this matter, yet both betimes Concurr'd in it. Not only <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> the <HI>Martyr,</HI> and <HI>Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> as well as <HI>Tertullian,</HI> and &s;everal others of the <HI>Primitive Writers,</HI> but al&s;o Governour <HI>Pliny</HI> him&s;elf will tell us, what <HI>Singers to their GOD,</HI> the Faithful were then known to be; and how much they <HI>Wor&s;hipped</HI> Him in the&s;e <HI>Beauties of Holine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 2. BUT this piece of <HI>Natural Wor&s;hip</HI> is further Confirmed by a <HI>po&s;itive In&s;titution</HI> of GOD our SA|VIOUR for it. The <HI>Sacred Scriptures</HI> with which the Holy SPIRIT of GOD has Enriched us, have directed us unto this <HI>Way</HI> of Wor&s;hipping. In our <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> we there find it as a Command of GOD; but Calculated particularly for Times under the <HI>New-Te&s;tament:</HI> P&s;al. LXVIII. 32. <HI>Sing Prai&s;es unto GOD, ye Kingdoms of the Earth, O Sing Prai&s;es unto the Lord.</HI> And P&s;al. C. 1, 2. <HI>Make a Joyful Noi&s;e unto the Lord, All ye Lands; Come into his Pre&s;ence with Singing.</HI> The <HI>Ninety-fifth P&s;alm</HI> in our P&s;alter, does according to the Interpretation of our Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> an <HI>Interpreter, One of a Thou&s;and,</HI> certainly to be relied upon! &mdash; Pre&s;cribe the <HI>Duties</HI> of a <HI>Sabbath</HI> in the Days of the Go&s;pel. But what is the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> of tho&s;e Duties? <HI>O come, Let us Sing unto the Lord, Let us with P&s;alms make a Joyful Noi&s;e unto Him.</HI> In our <HI>New-Te&s;tament</HI> it &s;elf
<PB N="3" REF="002241_0008_0FDAD6A20E0508F8">'tis a Thing &s;o po&s;itively enjoined, that it mu&s;t be a wonder, if any Chri&s;tian can make any Que&s;tion of it. How plainly is it commanded? Jam. V. 13. <HI>Is any cheerful among you, Let him &s;ing P&s;alms.</HI> Yea, In the <HI>Pauline</HI> Epi&s;tles, we have it; how frequently, how earne&s;tly inculcated! This Exerci&s;e is none of tho&s;e <HI>Intru&s;ions</HI> into our <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> which the <HI>Wor&s;hippers in the Inner-Court,</HI> wou'd &s;ee a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> &s;erv'd upon, 'Tis <HI>Warranted</HI> with a mo&s;t Inconte&s;tible <HI>In&s;ti|tution.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. THE <HI>Sacred Scriptures,</HI> which have <HI>Directed</HI> us to <HI>Sing unto the Lord, and Ble&s;s His Name;</HI> have al&s;o <HI>&s;upplied</HI> us with an admirable and &s;ufficient <HI>Matter</HI> for our <HI>Songs.</HI></P>
<P>WE have a PSALTER, whereof the bigge&s;t part is of PSALMS, that were Compo&s;ed by <HI>David,</HI> the <HI>&s;weet Singer of I&s;rael;</HI> A <HI>David,</HI> who being the <HI>Last</HI> of the Limitations which the Glorious GOD made of the <HI>Line,</HI> wherein the <HI>Fir&s;t Promi&s;e</HI> was to be ac|compli&s;hed, GOD for the &s;ake of that REDEEMER, di&s;tingui&s;hed him, with doing of amazing Things for him, and by him; whereof <HI>This</HI> was one, that he was made the greate&s;t <HI>In&s;trument</HI> for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Devotions of the Church, that ever was in the World. The re&s;t were Compo&s;ed by other <HI>Holy Men of GOD, who wrote as they were moved by the Holy SPIRIT.</HI></P>
<P>IN both <HI>Te&s;taments,</HI> we have Compo&s;ures under a <HI>Poetical Dre&s;s,</HI> fitted unto <HI>Tunes,</HI> that were then known in the Church of GOD. The mo&s;t <HI>Ancient Song</HI> that is now extant in the World is That in the <HI>Fifteenth</HI> Chapter of <HI>Exodus:</HI> In which there is a &s;urprizing <HI>Pro|phecy</HI> of what is to be Sung upon the <HI>Perdition</HI> of <HI>Anti-chri&s;t.</HI> Except the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> which (all but the Two fir&s;t Chapters, and the La&s;t,) is a <HI>Poem</HI> writ in Ver&s;e, might (perhaps by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> making a pre&s;ent of it unto his Country-Men under their <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Captivity) be written before it.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002241_0009_0FDAD69D12867650">
THE a&s;toni&s;hing Song, in the Thirty &s;econd Chapter of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> was prepared in the Heavenly World, and &s;ent from thence by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> to be a per|petual <HI>Witne&s;s</HI> for GOD, among the Sons of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>THE Song of <HI>Deborah</HI> is a Rare <HI>Poem,</HI> and one that it &s;eems the Wicked <HI>Homer</HI> was no more a Stran|ger to, than he was to our <HI>Eighteenth P&s;alm,</HI> when he formed the cur&s;ed <HI>Iliad,</HI> with which he brought in upon the World, a Flood of Debaucheries and Im|pieties.</P>
<P>IN the Song of <HI>Hannah,</HI> we have the Name of The MESSIAH, fir&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Song of Songs</HI> penned by <HI>Solomon,</HI> we have the promi&s;ed MESSIAH, whom his Father had Sung in our <HI>Forty fifth P&s;alm,</HI> appearing in the Habit of a <HI>Royal High-Prie&s;t,</HI> and the E&s;pou&s;al between Him and His Church, (the <HI>Tipheret</HI> and the <HI>Maleuth</HI>) celebrated, with Metaphors, wherein <HI>he &s;pake of Trees,</HI> and produced a Noble <HI>Pa&s;toral.</HI></P>
<P>THE Book of <HI>Proverbs</HI> (except the Nine fir&s;t Chapters,) gives us, as it was the Cu&s;tom of Anti|quity, the <HI>Maxims of Wi&s;dom,</HI> in &s;uch a way as to be <HI>Sung</HI> among the People.</P>
<P>IN the Volumn of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> there are more than One or Two <HI>Songs,</HI> (be&s;ides that of, <HI>The Vineyard,</HI>) which are of a lofty &s;train, and full of Evangelical My&s;teries. That of <HI>Hezekiah</HI> is tran&s;cendently wor|thy to be <HI>Printed in a Book; to be graven with an Iron pen and Lead in the Rock forever.</HI></P>
<P>THE Book of <HI>Lamentations,</HI> has Two Chapters, wherein the <HI>Tears given in great Mea&s;ure,</HI> to the Peo|ple of GOD, are Poetically <HI>mea&s;ured.</HI></P>
<P>THE Book of <HI>Habakkuk</HI> has in it, a Song, than which, can any thing be more <HI>Sublime</HI> or <HI>Seraphic?</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Mary,</HI> and the <HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Zacharias,</HI> have more than a little of, <HI>The Wonderful,</HI> in them.</P>
<P>'TIS not long, before the <HI>Multitude of the Hea|venly Ho&s;t,</HI> invite us to a Con&s;ort with <HI>them,</HI> in One
<PB N="5" REF="002241_0010_0FDAD6B9B91E0260">of the <HI>Songs</HI> which will enable us to <HI>&s;peak</HI> (and &s;ing) <HI>with the Tongue of Men and Angels.</HI> The Expiring <HI>Simeon</HI> mounting up to Heaven, <HI>Sings as he Mounts.</HI></P>
<P>ANON, in the <HI>Apocalyp&s;e,</HI> we have more <HI>Songs</HI> in which we over hear the <HI>Holy Ones</HI> in the Heavenly World, Glorifying our GOD and SAVIOUR; And, <HI>O lifted up to Heaven we,</HI> in the&s;e Communications!</P>
<P>HERE is our PSALTER! And were we enriched with no more Trea&s;ures than The&s;e, wherein the Holy SPIRIT of GOD has thus provided for the <HI>Songs</HI> of His People, what a precious Article in, <HI>The Un&s;earchable Riches of</HI> CHRIST, have we therein to be exceedingly Thankful for?</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing that we have no <HI>other Portions</HI> of the In&s;pired Writings exhibited in the <HI>Tuneable Poetry</HI> of the Ancients, mu&s;t we thence conclude, that we are forbidden to put any other <HI>Portions</HI> of them into &s;uch a <HI>Metre,</HI> as may render them capable of being <HI>Song</HI> among the People of GOD? Surely, the Ser|vants or GOD may take other <HI>Paragraphs</HI> of our BIBLE, e&s;pecially &s;uch as have the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious <HI>My&s;tecies of the Go&s;pel,</HI> &s;o plainly Contained and Re|vealed in them, that in <HI>Singing</HI> thereof, we &s;hall <HI>&s;hew forth the Salvation of</HI> GOD, and they may with the <HI>Singing</HI> thereof, <HI>Give Thanks unto the Lord,</HI> as it becomes <HI>the Redeemed of the Lord.</HI> Yea, The Great &amp; Good <HI>Voe|tius</HI> does not &s;cruple to &s;ay, <HI>Nihil alrenum ab u&s;u Scrip|turae fe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">erint, qui &s;ymbolum, quod vocant, Apo&s;tolicum, et Decalogum, ad Numeros et Modulos redegerunt.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 4. THE <HI>Songs</HI> which are <HI>prepared</HI> for us by the Holy SPIRIT of GOD, in the <HI>In&s;pired Writings,</HI> that <HI>&s;hine in this Dark Place,</HI> ought certainly to be <HI>preferred</HI> with us, before any meer <HI>Human Compo&s;ures,</HI> in the <HI>Public Wor&s;hip of the Faithful.</HI> Tho&s;e which for their Original are peculiarly the <HI>Songs of Zion,</HI> are the mo&s;t proper to be u&s;ed in its <HI>A&s;&s;emblies.</HI> 'Tis

Socrates</HI> mentions the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> written by <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom,</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;e|bius</HI> mentions the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> written by <HI>Nepos.</HI> The <HI>Arians</HI> made many <HI>Hymns</HI> to be Sung, for the Pro|pagation of their <HI>Here&s;ies:</HI> And the <HI>Orthodox</HI> willing to be <HI>made wi&s;e from their Enemies,</HI> made <HI>Hymns</HI> for the Pre&s;ervation of the <HI>Faith once delivered to the Saints.</HI> Yea, <HI>Great was the Army</HI> of them, who followed <HI>Am|bro&s;e</HI> in the Publi&s;hing of <HI>Hymns</HI> for the u&s;e of the Latin Church. The <HI>Te Deum</HI> a&s;cribed unto <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> makes to this Day a mighty Noi&s;e in the World. The <HI>German P&s;alter</HI> has in it <HI>Hymns</HI> of <HI>Luthers</HI> Compo&s;ing. And in the <HI>Bohemian</HI> Churches of the later Days, they had a <HI>Cantional</HI> in which there were &s;even hundred and forty <HI>Sacred Songs</HI> be&s;ides the <HI>Davidical P&s;alms.</HI> But certainly, the <HI>Hymns</HI> of <HI>Unin&s;pired</HI> Men, cannot be &s;o <HI>Profitable</HI> for all <HI>In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and may not have &s;o much Re&s;pect paid unto them, as tho&s;e that are <HI>given by In&s;piration of GOD. Au&s;tin</HI> did well to blame the <HI>Donati&s;ts,</HI> for leaving the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> and Singing <HI>Hymns</HI> of their own Invention. Yea, if the Limitations ordered by a Synod at <HI>Bracara,</HI> were perhaps a little too &s;trict, <HI>Extra P&s;almos veteris Te&s;tamenti, nihil Poetice Compo&s;itum, in Eccle&s;ia P&s;allatur,</HI> yet it was a Wi&s;e order pa&s;&s;ed in a Synod at <HI>Laodicea,</HI> that forbad <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Private P&s;alms</HI> to be u&s;ed in the Church. The French Churches, have wi&s;ely confined them&s;elves unto the <HI>Scriptural Songs;</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> have Har|monized with them, in pa&s;&s;ing that Order, <HI>In Eccle&s;iis cantabuntur P&s;almi Davidis, Omi&s;&s;iscanticis quae in S. Scrip|tura nou reperiuntur.</HI> Can any thing be &s;o Rich, &s;o Full, &s;o &s;ublime, as what the Holy SPIRIT of GOD
<PB N="7" REF="002241_0012_0FDAD6BB397BE1A0">has declared? Every Line will weigh again&s;t a <HI>Gol|den Wedge of Ophir;</HI> Every Word is a <HI>Pearl,</HI> and has a &s;en&s;e and worth in it, that is Invaluable. The P&s;alms of <HI>David</HI> were Sung in <HI>Jeho&s;haphats</HI> time, as well as in <HI>Solomon's,</HI> and in <HI>Hezekiah's</HI> time, we read, <HI>He commanded the Levites to &s;ing prai&s;e unto the Lord, with the Words of David and of A&s;aph.</HI> Words of an Excellency and an Efficacy, which are not found but where the <HI>Spirit of the Lord &s;peaks by</HI> Men, and <HI>His Word is in their Tongue.</HI> Yea, Even the <HI>Song of the Lamb,</HI> in the <HI>Fifteenth</HI> of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> &s;eems to be fetched out of our <HI>Eighty &s;ixth</HI> P&s;alm; and the Song of the <HI>Angels</HI> in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> of <HI>Luke</HI> &s;eems to be fetched out of our <HI>Eighty fifth.</HI> And our Ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR Him|&s;elf, a <HI>Greater than David,</HI> and his Antitype, no doubt, at the Pa&s;&s;over, as often as it recurred, Sung at lea&s;t part of what they called, <HI>The Great Hallel,</HI> which was the <HI>Hundred and thirteenth</HI> P&s;alm, with the Five that followed it. In a word, we are &s;o directed, Eph. V. 19 <HI>Speak to your &s;elves in P&s;alms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs.</HI> In this Direction, there appears an evident Reference, unto the Di&s;tinction of the Poems in our <HI>Hebrew P&s;alter.</HI> The Poems there are di&s;tingui&s;hed by Three Terms, exactly an&s;wering unto <HI>The&s;e.</HI> It &s;eems to be &s;aid, <HI>Let your P&s;alter &s;upply you with the Songs, wherein the Admonitions of Piety are to be received, and pre&s;erved, and applied among you!</HI></P>
<P>IT would follow from hence, that &s;uch a <HI>Ver&s;ion</HI> of the PSALMS, as keeps mo&s;t <HI>Clo&s;e to the Original,</HI> were mo&s;t of all to be wi&s;hed for. Of about Three Times &s;even Tran&s;lations of the <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> which we have &s;een fitted for the Tunes of our <HI>Sacred Songs</HI> there is not one, but what for the &s;ake of a needle&s;s <HI>Rhyme,</HI> does <HI>Leave out</HI> very much of what the Holy SPIRIT has in&s;erted in the <HI>Original,</HI> and <HI>put in</HI> as much of what is not <HI>there</HI> to be met withal. Of the&s;e Tran&s;lations, there are &s;ome <HI>Nearer</HI> to the <HI>Original</HI> than others, and have more of <HI>That</HI> in it, with lea&s;t of Di|ver&s;ion

After all, of what Con|&s;equence is (the <HI>Similis Definentia</HI> of) <HI>Rhyme,</HI> to our <HI>P&s;almody,</HI> when even to <HI>Poetry</HI> it &s;elf, it is not E&s;&s;ential?

<P>&sect; 5. IN the Provi&s;ion which our <HI>P&s;alter</HI> has made of <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> for us, we find all the Intentions of PIETY, how admirably provided for!</P>
<P>WOULD we be well In&s;tructed in the <HI>My&s;teries</HI> which belong to the Kingdom of GOD, or well ac|quainted with the <HI>Prophecies</HI> that refer to the Delay or the Coming of the Kingdom? In our <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> we &s;hall find our &s;elves <HI>Taught of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Pardoning Mercy</HI> of our GOD is to be implored, how pathetically, how effectually may we with the cries of our <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> pierce the Hea|vens,

<P>WHATEVER <HI>Temptations</HI> we are a&s;&s;aulted withal, the Harp of <HI>David</HI> being with our <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> well play'd upon, the <HI>Tempter</HI> will ere long depart; <HI>Ser|pents</HI> will bur&s;t and break upon the <HI>Singing</HI> of &s;uch <HI>Ver&s;es</HI> as the&s;e.</P>
<P>WE may have <HI>Adver&s;aries,</HI> of who&s;e Influences to hurt us, we may have &s;ome Terror upon us.

<P>AND now, What &s;hall be &s;aid? Surely, By our <HI>&s;piritual Songs</HI> we may now after &s;ome &s;ort begin <HI>Hea|ven upon Earth.</HI> It was very ju&s;tly &s;aid by <HI>Chry&s;ostom</HI> unto the Devout Singer,

There having been promi&s;ed, at the beginning, <HI>One to be born of a Woman, by whom the Grand Enemy of Mankind &s;hould be de&s;troyed, and Mankind be delivered from the Mi&s;eries which our Fall from GOD has brought upon us:</HI> Upon the the Faith of this <HI>Promi&s;ed REDEEMER</HI> our whole <HI>Bible</HI> turns, more than any one thing in the World; and this <HI>Faith,</HI> more than any one thing in the World, explains numberle&s;s Pa&s;&s;ages in this <HI>Book of the MES|SIAH</HI> where many <HI>Great Things,</HI> would el&s;e appear <HI>&s;trange Things</HI> unto us. The People of GOD in the elder Times, had a &s;tronger Idea of the <HI>First Promi&s;e</HI> than is commonly imagined in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">; their Thoughts, their Hopes, their Aims, ran very much on the <HI>Promi&s;ed Re|deemer;</HI> And the Holy SPIRIT of GOD gratified them with various and growing Di&s;coveries of Him. <HI>David</HI> &s;aw more of the <HI>Promi&s;ed Redeemer</HI> than any that had gone before him; who yet <HI>&s;aw His Day, and

It has been the Conjecture of &s;ome Learned Men, that &s;ome of the <HI>Songs</HI> among the Ancient <HI>Grecians,</HI> did in reality celebrate the At|chievements of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> with Traditions which <HI>Cadmus</HI> the <HI>Pluenician,</HI> left among them. 'Tis very &s;ure, That our <HI>&s;piritual Songs</HI> do every where celebrate the Per|fections and the Performances of our wonderful JE|SUS; and when we find HIM in them, we have then found the very <HI>Kernel</HI> of them: We are then Fed with the <HI>Fine&s;t of the Wheat, and &s;atisfied with Honey

<P>&sect; 9. TO give a fini&s;hing &s;troke, unto the Directi|ons, <HI>How to Sing the songs of the Lord, in the Land of a Stranger?</HI> Here &s;hall be tran&s;cribed a Paragraph of an Introduction, to a well-known Edition of the <HI>P&s;al|ter</HI> in <HI>Blank Ver&s;e,</HI> with <HI>Illu&s;trations</HI> upon it.</P>
<Q><P>THERE is a wonderful Thing to be ob&s;erved concerning our PSALMS, which has hitherto been too much over look'd, by all the <HI>Unin&s;pired Interpre|ters;</HI> But it is a Thing, which our SAVIOUR, and His Apo&s;tles, who have quoted the PSALMS near Fifty times, have led us into the Apprehen&s;ion of. This is, That they are full of <HI>Prophecies;</HI> and our <HI>P&s;alter</HI> is indeed the mo&s;t <HI>Prophetical Book</HI> in the World.</P>
<P>IT is more particularly, but not without holy <HI>A&s;toni&s;hments!</HI> &mdash; to be ob&s;erved, That the De&s;ign of the <HI>Prophetic Spirit</HI> in the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> all along, has been to de&s;cribe the Sufferings of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation,</HI> and of the <HI>Christian Surrogate,</HI> under the Tyranny of <HI>Antichri&s;t;</HI> and foretel the Characters and Confu&s;ions of that <HI>Wicked one,</HI> and of his Followers; and Pre|dict the Recovery of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation</HI> from their
<PB N="20" REF="002241_0025_0FDAD6B224841560">long Di&s;per&s;ions; and a long Felicity for them, and the <HI>Converted Gentiles</HI> a&s;&s;ociated with them, under the &s;ucceeding Reign of the MESSIAH; and the Happy State of the <HI>New Earth,</HI> in which, under the Influen|ces of the <HI>New Heaven,</HI> there &s;hall <HI>Dwell Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and the <HI>Tabernacle of GOD, &s;hall be with Men,</HI> and <HI>He &s;hall dwell with them, and they &s;hall be His People, and GOD Him&s;elf &s;hall be with them, and be their GOD.</HI></P>
<P>IT may be the Word which we render, <HI>To the Chief Mu&s;ician,</HI> but which may be rendred (and was of old &s;o,) <HI>For the End,</HI> may be to intimate, that the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> are calculated eminently with an Eye to the Things that are to be done, at that which the Bible calls, <HI>The time of the End.</HI> Indeed, <HI>Jerom</HI> long ago found <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> in the <HI>P&s;alms:</HI> And <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> affirmed, That the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> ought all to be under&s;tood of CHRIST and His Church, and many of them refer to <HI>After|Ages.</HI> But we now Improve in our Di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, The <HI>Devout Singer</HI> like the <HI>Be|loved Di&s;ciple,</HI> &s;hall <HI>be carried away in the Spirit into the Wilderne&s;s,</HI> and be &s;hown the <HI>Judgment of the Great Whore, that &s;itteth upon many Waters.</HI> He &s;hall al&s;o in the&s;e Vi&s;ions of GOD, <HI>See the Holy City, New Jeru&s;a|lem, coming down from GOD out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride for her Husband.</HI> Very depraved mu&s;t be that Soul, that has not, a Reli&s;h for &s;uch Contem|plations, more than for any Earthly Entertainments; and that will not heartily &s;ay, <HI>They're more de&s;ireable than Gold, yea, than much &s;olid Gold; than Honey al&s;o &s;weeter much, or dropping Honey-Comb.</HI></P></Q>
<P>&sect; 10. BEHOLD, A Sweet <HI>Exerci&s;e of PIETY,</HI> to a &s;hare wherein <HI>All People</HI> are invited: A call to <HI>Make the Joyful Shouts of a Jubliee,</HI> is what the Tune of, <HI>All People,</HI> is to be &s;et unto. If the Demand be, Do it <HI>O all Kings of the Earth; and</HI> (which will &s;oon follow) <HI>All the People too;</HI> Do it, <HI>O Princes and all you, the
<PB N="21" REF="002241_0026_0FDAD6C94A2BED78">Judges of the Earth:</HI> The&s;e &s;hall have a <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> and a <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> as well as a <HI>David,</HI> going before them. Do it, <HI>O you that Young Men are, Yea, and Young Women too: Do it, O you that Old Men are, with Babes in Infancy.</HI> Even they who are <HI>Forbidden</HI> to <HI>&s;peak in the Church,</HI> are <HI>Commanded</HI> neverthele&s;s to <HI>Sing</HI> there. The Hand|maids of the Lord, forget <HI>Miriam,</HI> and <HI>All the Women that went out after her,</HI> if they decline their part in <HI>Singing</HI> the Prai&s;es of GOD; &s;ince diver&s;e of our <HI>&s;piritual Songs</HI> were compo&s;ed by Per&s;ons of the <HI>Female Sex,</HI> 'tis but Rea&s;onable that the <HI>Female Sex</HI> bear their part in <HI>Singing</HI> of the&s;e, and all the re&s;t. A <HI>Gorgenia</HI> the Renowned Si&s;ter of <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> is commemorated for it. And as no <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> are to be exempted, &s;o no <HI>Places</HI> are to be excluded from the <HI>Rea&s;onable Service;</HI> but we are to <HI>Sing every where, Lifting up an Holy Voice,</HI> unto the Lord. Not only &s;hould we <HI>with all our Heart Prai&s;e the Eternal GOD, where the Upright meet Privately, and where more Publickly;</HI> But al&s;o the <HI>Chri&s;tian Hou&s;|holder</HI> &s;hould make this one of his <HI>Family-Sacrifices.</HI> Yea, how comfortably may the <HI>Family</HI> go to Re&s;t, when the la&s;t Ver&s;e of the <HI>Fourth P&s;alm</HI> has concluded all? This truly is one of the Excellent Methods, wherein the <HI>Word of CHRIST</HI> is to <HI>Dwell Richly</HI> with us, and be a con&s;tant and welcome Lodger in our <HI>Dwellings.</HI> Yea, <HI>Theodoret</HI> reports, That the Faithful in the Pri|mitive Times, had the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> by heart, &s;o that they would Recreate them&s;elves with <HI>Singing</HI> them in the <HI>Streets</HI> and in the <HI>Fields,</HI> as well as in their <HI>Dwellings.</HI> A <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> turn a <HI>Dungeon</HI> into a <HI>Palace,</HI> by <HI>Singing</HI> there. One &s;ays, <HI>The Earth Danced unto their Mu&s;ick.</HI></P>
<P>IT is Remarkable, That when the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of GOD has been making any <HI>New Appearance,</HI> a mighty Zeal for the <HI>Singing</HI> of PSALMS, has attended it, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted it. And may we &s;ee our People grow more <HI>Zealous</HI> of this <HI>Good Work,</HI> what an hopeful <HI>Sign of the Times</HI> would be &s;een in it, That <HI>the Time of Singing is
<PB N="22" REF="002241_0027_0FDAD6B409DBF4D0">come, and the Voice of the Turtle is to be heard in the Land?</HI></P>
<P>BUT in the pur&s;uance of this Holy Intention, it would be very de&s;irable, that people, (and e&s;pecially our YOUNG PEOPLE, who are mo&s;t in the Years of Di&s;cipline,) would more generally <HI>Learn to SING</HI> and become able to Sing by RULE, and keep to the NOTES of the TUNES, which our <HI>&s;piritual Songs</HI> are &s;et unto; which would be to <HI>Sing,</HI> as <HI>Origen</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, <GAP DESC="foreign">; <HI>Agreeably</HI> and <HI>Me|ledion&s;ly.</HI> In Early Days a famous Council condemned it; in that there were <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Di&s;orderly Clamours,</HI> with which the <HI>P&s;almody</HI> was then &s;ometimes di&s;turbed. In later Days, <HI>Ca&s;&s;ander</HI> upbraided it, <HI>Ad feritatem quandum barbaricum compo&s;ito &s;ono, Boant, Latrant, mugi|unt, frendunt, rudunt, et quidvis potius quam canunt. &mdash; Tarttaricos quosdam clamores Exprimunt.</HI> In plain Engli&s;h, They <HI>made &s;ad and wild Work on't.</HI> It has been found accordingly in &s;ome of our Congregations, that in length of Time, their <HI>Singing</HI> has degenerated, into an <HI>Odd Noi&s;e,</HI> that has had more of what we want a Name for, than any <HI>Regular Singing</HI> in it; whereby the <HI>Celestial Exerci&s;e</HI> is di&s;honoured; and indeed the <HI>Third Com|mandment</HI> is tre&s;pa&s;s'd on. To take notice of the <HI>Ridiculous Pleas,</HI> wherewith &s;ome very weak People, go to confirm this Degeneracy, would indeed be to pay too much Re&s;pect unto them. And they mu&s;t have &s;trange Notions of the Divine SPIRIT, and of His Operations, who &s;hall imagine, that the Delight which their <HI>Untuned Ears</HI> take in an <HI>Uncouth Noi&s;e,</HI> more than in a <HI>Regular Singing,</HI> is any <HI>Communion</HI> with Him. The Skill of <HI>Regular Singing,</HI> is among the <HI>Gifts</HI> of GOD unto the Children of Men, and by no means unthankfully to be Neglected or De&s;pi&s;ed. For the Congregations, wherein 'tis wanting, to recover a <HI>Regular Singing,</HI> would be really a <HI>Reformation,</HI> and a Recovery out of an <HI>Apo&s;tacy,</HI> and what we may judge that Heaven would be plea&s;ed withal. We ought
<PB N="23" REF="002241_0028_0FDAD6CE23F231B8">certainly to Serve our GOD with our <HI>Best,</HI> and <HI>Re|gular Singing</HI> mu&s;t needs be <HI>Better</HI> than the confu&s;ed Noi&s;e of a Wilderne&s;s. <HI>GOD is not for Confu&s;ion in the Churches of the Saints;</HI> but requires, <HI>Let all things be done decently.</HI> 'Tis a Great Mi&s;take of &s;ome weak People, That the <HI>Tunes</HI> regulated with the <HI>Notes</HI> u&s;ed in the <HI>Regular Singing</HI> of our Churches are the &s;ame that are u&s;ed in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> And what if they were?

But the <HI>Tunes</HI> u&s;ed in the <HI>French P&s;almody,</HI> and from Them in the <HI>Dutch</HI> al&s;o, were &s;et by a famous Martyr of JESUS CHRIST; And when <HI>Sternhold</HI> and <HI>Hopkins</HI> illuminated <HI>England,</HI> with their Ver&s;ion of the <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> the <HI>Tunes</HI> have been &s;et by &s;uch as a Good Prote&s;tant may be willing to hold Commu|nion withal.
