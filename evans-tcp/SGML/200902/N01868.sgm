<P>SOME Late <HI>Votes</HI> pa&s;&s;ed in the General A&s;&s;em|bly at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and Printed in the <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> News-Letter, Cau&s;e us to Reflect with &s;ome Wonder on the <HI>Deplorable State of the Plantations.</HI></P>
<P>They that are &s;ent over as <HI>Governours</HI> thither, appear as Per&s;ons of Suitable <HI>Abilities,</HI> and approved <HI>Loyalty.</HI> They are in Favour with &s;ome Mini&s;ters of <HI>State,</HI> who Recommend them to the King or Queen for the Time be|ing; and are in Fee with their <HI>Clarks,</HI> by who&s;e Means their Bu&s;ine&s;s is done the more Effectually. When they arrive with their Commi&s;&s;ions, they Expre&s;s them&s;elves in Obliging Terms; and the Ravi&s;h'd People, who are quite Giddy with Joy, if they have Governours, which they may hope, will not <HI>Cut their Throats,</HI> make them Noble Pre&s;ents, and &s;end home an <HI>Addre&s;s of Thanks</HI> for &s;uch Admirable Governours.</P>
<P>Their Next Work is, by all po&s;&s;ible Artifices, to get into all <HI>Offices</HI> about the Country, &s;uch as are, or they know, will be, meer <HI>Creatures</HI> to them; or at lea&s;t, &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as are not f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rni&s;hed either with <HI>Courage</HI> or <HI>Conduct.</HI> to make any <HI>Complaints</HI> Home again&s;t them, in Ca&s;e of any Male-Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>After this, let the Governour do what he will, either
<PB N="2" REF="002214_0005_0FDACEF05E058430">there will be no Body <HI>Strong</HI> enough to Repair unto the Cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with due Remon&s;trances; or if any Body <HI>do,</HI> the <HI>Governour</HI> has many Ways to mole&s;t him and his, and to Defeat all his Undertakings. Yea, 'tis Ten Thou&s;and to One, but at the very Time, when an oppre&s;&s;ed Per&s;on is Solliciting his own, and an oppre&s;&s;ed People's Cau&s;e, the Governour may have &s;o modell'd the <HI>General A&s;&s;em|bly,</HI> that they &s;hall pa&s;s wretched <HI>Votes</HI> to his Advantage, and <HI>Ki&s;s the Hand,</HI> which all the open Eyes in the Coun|try &s;ee Stabbing of them.</P>
<P>One would have thought, the People of <HI>N. England</HI> &s;hould have been Sen&s;ible of their Good Fortune in it; that when they are betrayed in Mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances by an Hungry Governour, who has been willing to Enrich him&s;elf and his Family, on the Ruines of his Country, &s;ome Gentlemen of Note, have interpo&s;ed with Humble <HI>Addre&s;&s;es</HI> to her Maje&s;ty on their Behalf. They have no <HI>Agent</HI> here, but what is entirely in the Intere&s;t of their Governour. When the whole Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives &s;ent over hither, an Addre&s;s to the Queen, relating to matter of the greate&s;t Importance, the <HI>Agent</HI> whom they had I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oy'd and Rewarded with &s;ome Hundreds of Pounds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fu&s;ed to Pre&s;ent the Addre&s;s, becau&s;e it would not &s;uit with the Governour's Intere&s;t, and wrote them word, <HI>That no Addre&s;s. mu&s;t be pre&s;ented, except Signed by the Governour.</HI> And yet after this, the &s;ame Gentle|man could pre&s;ent <HI>Adre&s;&s;es</HI> for the continuance of the Governour which were &s;igned by <HI>Private Hands,</HI> and pro|cured by <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> little to the Honour of tho&s;e Concerned. Some Gentlemen here, knowing the Opre&s;s'd and Betray'd Condition of that poor People, have Ad|dre&s;s'd on their Behalf; and have &s;aid nothing in their Addre&s;s, but what they had the Oaths of &s;everal Good Men, to &s;upport the Truth of what was A&s;&s;erted: But, lo! to their Surprize, they find them&s;elves in the <HI>Boston News Letter</HI> Expo&s;ed, as having been the Authors of <HI>Seandalous and wicked Accu&s;ations!</HI> The <HI>Coun&s;ellors</HI> of <HI>N.

<P>Letters from <HI>New-England</HI> Inform us, That the Great and only Rea&s;on, why &s;ome of the Council there will <HI>&s;trmly Believe</HI> more Charitably of their Governour <HI>Dud|ley,</HI> than many others do, is, <HI>Becau&s;e his Family and In|terest is there, and therefore 'tis unrea&s;onable to Believe, that he would do any thing that &s;hould hurt the Country.</HI></P>
<P>But, Was not his <HI>Family and Interest</HI> there in Sir <HI>Ed|mund Andro&s;s</HI>'s time? And yet a Book Publi&s;hed here, by the Agents of <HI>New-England,</HI> after the Revolution, Intituled, <HI>The Revolution in</HI> New-England <HI>Justified,</HI> has given the World a &s;ad Story of what a Colonel <HI>Dudley</HI> may do towards the Ruining a Country which has his <HI>Family and Interests</HI> in it. Read that Hi&s;tory and you will find, that after Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> had been an Agent for the Country, he tack'd about, and join'd with the In&s;tru|ments that overthrew their <HI>Charter,</HI> and accepted an Ille|gal and Arbitrary Commi&s;&s;ion from King <HI>James,</HI> by which he held the Government, until the Arrival of Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;s,</HI> and then was, as <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> of the Council, and <HI>Chief Judge</HI> of the Territory, a <HI>Chief Tool</HI> of all the en&s;uing barbarous and infamous Admini&s;tration. They governed without an <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> when the Laws were propo&s;ed in the Council, tho' the <HI>major Part</HI> of the Coun|cil &s;hould happen to di&s;&s;ent, yet if the <HI>Governour</HI> was po&s;itive, there was a <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> at the Board, by who&s;e Allowance the Laws were immediately <HI>Engro&s;&s;ed, Pub|li&s;hed,</HI> and <HI>Executed:</HI> And Judge <HI>Dudley</HI> did not contra|dict it when &s;ome of the Principal Gentlemen in the Country were told at the Council Board, <HI>You have no more Privileges left you but this, that you are not Bought and Sold for Slaves.</HI> By the Sequel we &s;hall &s;ee not this neither. A <HI>Juncto,</HI> (wherein how often this Chief Judge, was of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> is now forgotten) made a
<PB N="4" REF="002214_0007_0FDACEF355F41248">World of Laws, which Pillaged that poor People De&s;pe|rately. They Levied a Tax on the whole People with|out any A&s;&s;embly; and when the Principal Per&s;ons, and &s;ome others in <HI>Ip&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> on that Occa&s;ion, with all po&s;&s;ible Mode&s;ty moved, that the King &s;hould be Humbly Petiti|on'd for the Liberty of an A&s;&s;embly, they were Commit|ted to Pri&s;on for an <HI>High Mi&s;demeanour,</HI> and were Denied an <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> &amp; Drag'd many Miles out of their own County to An&s;wer it at a Court in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> where <HI>Jurors</HI> were pickt for the Turn, that were neither <HI>Free-holders,</HI> nor &s;o much as <HI>Inhabitants.</HI> They were all Fined &s;evere|ly, and laid under great Bonds for their <HI>Good Behaviour;</HI> be&s;ides which, the Hungry Officers Extorted Fees of near Two Hundred Pounds, where they would not have ri&s;en to Ten Pounds, had any Law of <HI>England,</HI> or Ju&s;tice been Ob&s;erved. The Town&s;men of many other Places were &s;erved in the like Fa&s;hion; and our Judge <HI>Dudley</HI> was a Principal Actor in all this Wickedne&s;s. It was now denyed that any Man was owner of a Foot of Land in all the Colony. Judge <HI>Dudley</HI> gave it as his Judgment un|der his Hand. <HI>Writs of Intru&s;ion</HI> were pre&s;ently &s;erved upon the Chief Gentlemen in the Country, to Compel them, and others by the Terror of their Example, to take <HI>Patents</HI> for the Lands which they had quietly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for Fifty or Sixty Years together. For the&s;e <HI>Patents</HI> there were &s;uch Exorbitant Prices demanded, that Fifty Pounds would not purcha&s;e for its owner, an E&s;tate not worth Two Hundred; nor could all the Money and Moveables in the Territory, have defrayed the Charges of Pattenting the Lands.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Harpies</HI> were at any Time a little out of Money, they Invented Pretences to Impri&s;on the Be&s;t Men in the Country, and tho' there Appeared not the lea&s;t Informa|tion of any Crime again&s;t them, yet they were put unto intollerable Expences, and the Benefit of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> was denied unto them. Judge <HI>Dudley</HI> knows this, and we &s;uppo&s;e he has not forgotten either Colo|nell <HI>Saltonstal,</HI> or Major <HI>Appleton.</HI> Pickt <HI>Juries</HI> were commonly u&s;ed, for the Trouble of Hone&s;t and Worthy
<PB N="5" REF="002214_0008_0FDACEF4D2E3B180">Men, and they were hurried out of their own Counties to be tryed, where Juries for their Turn were not likely to be found there. Judge <HI>Dudley</HI> knows this; and we &s;uppo&s;e he remembers the famous Mr. <HI>Morton.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, all things were going to Wreck, but yet Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> was like to enrich him&s;elf and his Family in the general Ship-wreck. There lies the My&s;tery!</P>
<P>The&s;e things, and many more &s;uch things, are a&s;&s;erted in the Book afore&s;aid, not only by the Oaths of many hone&s;t Gentlemen, but al&s;o by a Declaratian Signed by the Honourable Hands of Judge <HI>Stoughton,</HI> and Major General <HI>Winthrop,</HI> and Collonel <HI>Shrimpton,</HI> and other Members of the Council.</P>
<P>The World has heard how narrowly Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> e&s;caped a <HI>De-Witting</HI> for the&s;e his Follies, from the inraged Peo|ple in the <HI>Revolution.</HI> Being then &s;ent over a Pri&s;ouer to <HI>England,</HI> he with the re&s;t, were here &s;et at Liberty. He returned, with a Commi&s;&s;ion for the Place of <HI>Chief Judge</HI> in the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> where his fir&s;t Work, after his Arrival was, to Condemn to Death, the Lieu|tenant Governour of the Province, and another Gentle|man, for not &s;urrendring the Government before Governour <HI>Slaughter</HI> arriv'd with his Commi&s;&s;ion. The Condemnation and Execution of the&s;e two Gentlemen, was a Bloody Bu&s;ine&s;s: It was afterwards Examined in Parliament, where Colonel <HI>Dudley</HI> underwent a Confu&s;ion which will never be worn off; and Mr. <HI>Con&s;tantine Phips,</HI> Pro|&s;ecuted the Matter with &s;o much Demon&s;tration, that Eminent Per&s;ons in both Hou&s;es, declared it, <HI>A Barbarous Murder;</HI> King, Lords, and Commons, did as good as de|clare it &s;o, and by an <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> Revoked the <HI>Attainder</HI> of the Murdered Gentlemen. On this Occa|&s;ion, Judge <HI>Stoughton,</HI> (who was yet always known to be as Partial to Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> and his Intere&s;t, as any Man in <HI>New England</HI>) &s;aid to &s;ome of his Friends, what he had formerly been heard to &s;ay unto others, <HI>Alas, to get a little Money, he would make his own Father hold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p his hand at the Bar.</HI> There, Gentlemen, you have again the <HI>Key</HI> to explain the Matter; which becau&s;e you

<P>After many Years Ab&s;ence from his Family, my Lord <HI>Bellamont,</HI> the Governour of <HI>New England</HI> Dies. Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> by many fair Promi&s;es, both to Gentlemen here, and at his own Home, obtains Recommendations for a Succe&s;&s;ion in the Government. He had not been long in the Government, before the following MEMORIAL was &s;ent over to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<DIV1 TYPE="memorial">
<HEAD><HI>A MEMORIAL</HI> On the Behalf of the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ett</HI>'s Bay, in <HI>NEW-ENGLAND;</HI> Relating to the Administration of their pre|&s;ent Governour, Collonel <HI>Dudley.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. ONE Principal Grievance, which Comprehends many under it, is, The Cour&s;e of <HI>Bribery,</HI> which runs thro' the Governours Admini&s;tration, whereby the Queen's Government is greatly Expo&s;ed in a Country where <HI>Bribery</HI> has rarely, if ever before this, been known to be Practi&s;ed. The Governour having brought in his Son to be Attorney General, this Corruption is the more effectually carried on between them, unto the great Oppre&s;&s;ion of the People.</P>
<P>Only two In&s;tances, among many, &s;hall be reported in this Memorial.</P>
<P N="1">1. Certain People having purcha&s;ed Land at a New Plantation called <HI>Na&s;hoba,</HI> and wanting a Confirmation of their Title, by an Act of the General A&s;&s;embly, as is U&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es) they could not have the Go|vernour's A&s;&s;ent unto the Act, without a <HI>Bribe</HI> of a Thou&s;and Acres of the be&s;t Land, and in the Center of the Plantation, and to the Ruin of the re&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Al&s;o, a Tract of Land at <HI>Nipmuck,</HI> belonging to
<PB N="7" REF="002214_0010_0FDACEF7D2CEF4E8">Nine or Ten Partners, when both Hou&s;es in the General A&s;&s;embly had pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Bill,</HI> to Allow their Title, (as was Requi&s;ite by an Old Law of the Country) the Go|vernour would not Sign the Act, until he had a Bribe of Twenty Pounds, and one whole Share of the Land, which was valued at One Hundred and Fifty Pounds more.</P>
<P>But, if a <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion of Enquiry</HI> could be Obtained, there would be &s;uch Practices of this Nature Di&s;covered as are hardly to be P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rrallel'd.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Governour, meerly to gratify his own Arbi|trary Will and Plea&s;ure did for &s;ome while Refu&s;e to fill up the nece&s;&s;ary Number of Judges; by which Means, the <HI>Courts</HI> dropt, and the <HI>Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice</HI> was Ob&s;tructed; and the oppre&s;&s;ed People were Defeated in their Suits, to the Damage of many Hundreds of Pounds.</P>
<P N="3">III. There have been odd <HI>Collu&s;ions</HI> with the Pirates of <HI>Quelch's</HI> Company, of which one In&s;tance is, That there was extorted the Sum of about Thirty Pounds from &s;ome of the Crue, for Liberty to walk at certain times in the Pri&s;on Yard; and this Liberty having been allow'd for Two or Three Days unto them, they were again confined to their former wretched Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P N="4">IV. An Army of Volunteers went out, and did Good Service upon the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy at <HI>Acady.</HI> They were encouraged by an Act of the Governour and General A&s;&s;embly, which promi&s;ed the Soldiers a cer|tain Share of the Plunder. When the Soldiers returned, &s;ome Officers, without their Con&s;ent or Knowledge, and before the Divi&s;ion of the Plunder, made the Governour a con&s;iderable Pre&s;ent out of it; whereupon he &s;o managed the Matter with the &s;aid Officers, as to cheat and cut on the Soldiers of near one Half that the Act <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the A&s;&s;em|bly had promi&s;ed them! When the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives applied them&s;elves to the Governour on this Occa&s;ion, they could get nothing from him. <HI>By this means, no more Volunteers are like to appear in her Maje&s;ty's Service.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002214_0011_0FDACEF95A480AE8">
The Governour's manner is, to trample on the A&s;&s;embly with gro&s;s Indignities; and &s;uch as they have never received from former Governours. Nor can they have any Redre&s;s of Grievances, tho' many have been from time to time repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>And when Bills for the Payment of the ju&s;t Debts of the Province, are pre&s;ented to him to be &s;igned, he has declared, he would not &s;ign them, except he were him&s;elf gratified with Sums demanded of them.</P>
<P>On the&s;e, and many more &s;uch Accounts, it is humbly conceived that it would be much for her Maje&s;ty's In tere&s;t, if a more acceptable Governour were placed over that Province.</P>

<P>This was the <HI>Memorial,</HI> but becau&s;e there was no Body to pro&s;ecute it, it fell to the Ground.</P>
<P>Much about the &s;ame time, there came to Light a little more of Col. <HI>Dudley</HI>'s De&s;igns upon the <HI>New Charter</HI> of the Province. It &s;eems, he was as willing to do the &s;ame Kindne&s;s for this, that he did for the <HI>Old One;</HI> and that he was at this very time doing for the Colony of <HI>Connecticut;</HI> which, if it were accompli&s;hed, would lay the Country open to an Innundation of Ca|lamities.

<P N="1">I.

<P>One may gue&s;s at the Politick Rea&s;on, which drew too many of them into that undeliberate, inconfiderate Vote afore&s;aid; by what one of them (a principal Stick|ler for <HI>Majority</HI> being <HI>Unanimity</HI>) utter'd in a Barber's Shop, with &s;o much Openne&s;s, that the Noi&s;e of it has reach'd over hither to <HI>London,</HI> That it was be&s;t for us, <HI>to keep this Governour, (tho' he had done very Bad things) for he had &s;ufficiently &s;punged upon the People, and had now got Money enough; he was now &s;atisfyed.</HI> [No, Sir, by your Leave, 'tis the Thir&s;t of a Drop&s;y!] <HI>And had pri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ately promis'd the Council, he would do &s;o no more.

<P>We have already intimated, how the Governour comes to have &s;o many Friends in the Hou&s;e; that are &s;o &s;et upon doing him Ju&s;tice, right or wrong. Be&s;ides the Care&s;&s;es of the Table, which are enough to dazzle an Hone&s;t Countryman, who thinks every Body Means what he Speaks; the Influence which Preferments and Commi&s;&s;ions have upon little Men, is innexpre&s;&s;ible. It mu&s;t needs be a Mortal Sin, to di&s;oblidge a Governour, that has enabled a Man to command a <HI>whole Country Town,</HI> and to &s;trut among his Neighbours, with the Illu&s;trious Titles of, <HI>Our Major,</HI> and <HI>The Captain,</HI> or <HI>His Wor&s;hip.</HI> Such magnificent Grandeurs make many to &s;tagger Egre|giou&s;ly! If it be but propo&s;ed in the A&s;&s;embly, that any Mi&s;managements of the Governour be Enquired into, we are informed, that &s;ome of tho&s;e Officers have been &s;o in&s;olent, as to move, <HI>That he who made the Propo&s;al &s;hould be &s;et in the Pillory.</HI> We perceive, the well-affected part of the A&s;&s;embly take much Notice of this. And it &s;eems, there was in this A&s;&s;embly, one Occa&s;ion Odder than the re&s;t, to take Notice of it.</P>
<P>There was a Pepre&s;entative of <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> who formerly failing in with the Intere&s;ts of the Country, &s;o provoked Col. <HI>Dudley,</HI> that in a Printed Pamphlet, publi&s;hed by him, (or the Per&s;on who wrote for him, &s;o as to make it He) he reproached the Country, That &s;uch a Figure

We are told, he has (for we know not what Rea&s;ons) a Number in the Hou&s;e&punc; who re&s;ign them&s;elves up to him, for him to do almo&s;t what he will with them; they follow <HI>his</HI> Dictates. The main things that have been carried in the late A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> otherwi&s;e than they &s;hould have been, are owing to his Dexterous Operations. Every Body &s;aid, <HI>This Man has in his Eye a</HI> Bribe, <HI>as the Re|ward of his Apostacy.</HI> He'll certainly be made a <HI>Justice,</HI> as &s;oon as his Drudgery in gaining the <HI>Vote</HI> afore&s;aid, is over! It came to pa&s;s;&mdash;As &s;oon as the <HI>Sham Vote,</HI> which has abu&s;ed the World in your Fooli&s;h News Letter yonder, was Gained, the Governour draws the Council in, to Con&s;ent, unto their own Immortal Honour, that this Gentleman <HI>Sow-Gelder</HI> &s;hould be made a <HI>Justice of the Peace!</HI> Fy Gentlemen, What d'ye do? &mdash; And &s;o the <HI>Wor&s;hipful</HI> of the County of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> have the practi&s;ing <HI>Sow-Gelder</HI> afore&s;aid, (it was Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> who taught us to call him &s;o!) &s;it on the Bench with them.

<P>But, it were good Advice for the People of <HI>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Eng|land,</HI> in chu&s;ing Repre&s;entatives, to beware of chu&s;ing any, who have their Obligations to their Governours,

<P>THE Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives then <HI>Firmly Believe, and are of Opinion,</HI> That their Governour was not Concerned in Trading with <HI>Vetch, Borland,</HI> and <HI>Law&s;on.</HI> Others do Firmly Believe the contrary.

And when one of them &s;wears in the Governour's Vindication, he only means, that the Gov. was not concern'd as a Merchant or Partner with them. He Ship'd nothing; there was nothing Ship'd on his Account. All this is nothing to the Purpo&s;e. And tho' Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> &s;hould be Clear of having any thing to do with the&s;e Three Grateful Merchants, yet there is another who is able to make di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Condemnation with the Three afore&s;aid, there was at this Time, under Impri&s;onment, by Vertue of the Sentence which the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> had illegally, (and it now appears Oppre&s;&s;ively) pa&s;&s;ed upon him, for a part in an unlawful Trade, one Captain <HI>Rou&s;e.</HI> The la&s;t General A&s;&s;embly growing &s;en&s;ible of his Con|dition, Voted his being let out upon Bail, that he might enjoy his Liberty. But for a Rea&s;on, which he will tell in due Time, the Vote was in a great Mea&s;ure Eluded.</P>
<P>It is Reported by &s;ome now in <HI>London.</HI> That the A&s;&s;embly's Vote to &s;et <HI>Rou&s;e</HI> at Liberty, was made very In&s;ignificant, by the means of one &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be a <HI>Tory</HI> Judge, one <HI>Leveret.</HI> And they &s;ay that <HI>Dudley</HI> has made that

An Au&s;picious beginning under their Lawyer Pre&s;ident, who, we al&s;o hear, was Cho&s;en a Lieutenant of their Artillery Company at <HI>Boston,</HI> the la&s;t Summer. Such Reports as the&s;e, make their Friends here, think that the People in <HI>New-England</HI> are running Mad.</P>
<P>But to proceed with Capt. <HI>Rou&s;e.</HI> Several of his Let|ters are come to <HI>London,</HI> by which we Under&s;tand,
<Q>That he having been &s;ent unto <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> on a Service for the Publick, in which he did Good Service, retur|ned Home under a Langui&s;hing Sickne&s;s. A way being by this fir&s;t Voyage open'd for a Private Trade between <HI>Port-Royal</HI> and <HI>Boston,</HI> he was Invited into a new Tra|ding Voyage; being told, <HI>He had Eaten the Sowre, he &s;hould now eat the Sweet.</HI> Governour <HI>Dudley</HI> told him, <HI>His main Bu&s;ine&s;s was to Steer clear of the Officers of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e.</HI> And the matter was propo&s;ed &s;o Ad|vantageou&s;ly, that <HI>&s;ome Body</HI> pre&s;&s;ed him to make the Governour a Pre&s;ent of an Hundred Pounds, for the Liberty and Advantage which was to be allow'd him. Becau&s;e he lay Sick, he <HI>had</HI> nothing, and <HI>&s;aw</HI> nothing aboard, but what had been Ship'd by others Concerned in the Voyage. He went and made the be&s;t of his Goods; and for <HI>this,</HI> and nothing but <HI>this,</HI> he under|went a Fine of <HI>Twelve Hundred Pounds.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Divers Per&s;ons, and e&s;pecially a certain Lady, came to him &s;everal times in the Pri&s;on, before his Tryal; and this as from the Governour, to per&s;wade him and the re&s;t, to Petition the A&s;&s;embly to take the <HI>Tryal</HI> into their own Hands; (which the Governour had him&s;elf pro|po&s;ed unto the A&s;&s;embly) with many fair Promi&s;es, that in a Week's time, or very quickly, the Governour would &s;o manage the A&s;&s;embly, as to bring them abroad again, without any further Trouble. Continual Communica|tions
<PB N="24" REF="002214_0027_0FDACF1152C14500">pa&s;&s;ed between <HI>Roxbury</HI> and the Pri&s;on; and tho&s;e good Offices were done, for which <HI>Paul Dudley,</HI> the Governour's Son, received of <HI>Borland</HI> and <HI>Law&s;on</HI> (as they have affirmed) at one time, a Pre&s;ent of <HI>Eighteen Pounds.</HI> They came with frequent Me&s;&s;ages, to keep Captain <HI>Rou&s;e</HI> in a good, pliant, &s;ilent Humour, and prevent his telling of Tales. Ju&s;t before his Trial, a Me&s;&s;enger came from the Governour to him, to De&s;ire him, <HI>That if the Governour &s;hould &s;ay any Sharp Things to him, he would not Retort any thing, or Mi&s;construe it; for he might a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf he was his hearty Friend.</HI> He would carry on the General A&s;&s;embly as far as was Convenient, but then, at la&s;t, bring off the Matter, and prevent their doing any Harm. Capt. <HI>Rou&s;e</HI> according|ly kept Coun&s;el; the Tryal went on, and the Fine anon, proves as we told ye, <HI>Twelve Hundred Pounds.</HI> The Governour's Son, could not demand of <HI>Rou&s;e,</HI> as he did of <HI>Cauphin,</HI> a Pre&s;ent of Twenty Pounds to the Gover|nour, for bringing his Fine &s;o low.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After this, Capt. <HI>Rou&s;e</HI> is frequently Sollicited to make the Governour a Pre&s;ent of <HI>Five or Six Hundred Pounds;</HI> with A&s;&s;urances, that the Governour would find a way for his Liberty, tho' he were now Impri&s;on'd by an Act of the A&s;&s;embly. He &s;till Refu&s;ed it; re&s;ol|ving to wait for Her Maje&s;ty's Di&s;&s;allowance of that Illegal Act. He wrote Letters to the Governour, In|treating him to procure a Mittigation of his Hard Cir|cum&s;tances, becau&s;e he had done nothing, but with Countenance from his <HI>Excellency.</HI> The Governour told the Me&s;&s;enger, that <HI>Rou&s;e</HI> mu&s;t Write another Sort of Letter to him; which the Me&s;&s;enger Explained, with telling him, that he mu&s;t Write, <HI>That the Governour had no Concern with what was done.</HI> But this he would never do. We hear that he continues Waiting for an Opportunity, to bring more fully to Light, many other things, be&s;ides tho&s;e that have been Mentioned.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e being the main Strokes of what Captain <HI>Rou&s;e</HI> has thought &s;it as yet to Declare of his Ca&s;e; we don't Wonder that the Practi&s;ing <HI>Sow-Gelder</HI> thought fit to

C. 52. made a &s;trange Decree, <HI>That if a Bi&s;hop Ordain a Slave, to be a Priest, knowing him to be a Slave, he &s;hall pay double the Price of him to his Ma&s;ter.</HI> We know not well, what &s;ort of a World it was when this Decree was made. All that we move you to, Gentlemen, is, That at your next General Council, you would make a Decree, <HI>That none of you &s;hall be Slaves, or do any thing that &s;hall fa&s;ten the Fetters of Slavery upon your People.</HI> We believe, that if you had known your <HI>Addre&s;&s;es</HI> would ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> come too late, (as &s;ome of them have) and expo&s;ed you to be Laughed at, you would have had more Wit, than to have done as you have. We &s;uppo&s;e you have heard what befell the Lord <HI>Verulam,</HI> for permitting his Servant to take a Bribe, and what was lately done to Sir <HI>J. T.</HI> becau&s;e he did like your Governour, take a Bribe to promote the pa&s;&s;ing a Bill. Certainly, if you had known your Governour had been guilty of &s;uch Briberies, and other Male-Admini&s;trations, as not only Chri&s;tian, but Heathen Princes have puni&s;h'd with the greate&s;t Severity, you would not have &s;igned your <HI>Ignorant Addre&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Before we we proceed to give an Account of the late Shameful Expedition of the <HI>New-Englanders</HI> again&s;t <HI>Port Royal,</HI> we &s;hall take &s;ome farther Notice of what Gen|tlemen worthy of Credit do a&s;&s;ure us. One writes, that a Gentleman in <HI>New-England,</HI> when he fir&s;t heard, that Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> had obtained a Commi&s;&s;ion to be Governour there, &s;aid, <HI>That he could not believe, that a Man who had been a Traytor to his Country; and an Apo&s;tate from the Religion in which he had been Educated, and had Murder'd two Men at</HI> New-York, <HI>better, and more Righteous than him&s;elf, would prove a good Governour.</HI></P>
<P>Another Letter &s;ays, That the Mi&s;ery of that People
<PB N="29" REF="002214_0032_0FDACF18D375DF60">of late, has been in their <HI>Councellors,</HI> as well (tho' not &s;o much) as in their Governour. The Priviledges which they enjoy by their pre&s;ent <HI>Charter,</HI> are Great and Singu|lar: For, no Man, but &s;uch as the People &s;hall nominate by their Repre&s;entatives, can be of the Governour's Coun|cil. Nor, may there be any <HI>Judge,</HI> or <HI>Ju&s;tice of the Peace,</HI> but what the Council thus cho&s;en by the Repre&s;entatives of the People &s;hall Con&s;ent unto. So that they may, and ought to be <HI>Shields</HI> unto the People, by keeping ill Men from being in Places of Power. Yet we hear, that their Governour has made a Number of very unfit Men to be their <HI>Ju&s;tices;</HI> and this with the Con&s;ent of his Council, without which he could make none. So that it &s;eems, the&s;e Great Priviledges &s;ignify but very little, thro' the Bu&s;illanimity, and Unfaithfulne&s;s of their Go|vernour's <HI>Coun&s;ellors,</HI> who will, too many of them, con&s;ent to almo&s;t any thing that he would have them. Witne&s;s, be&s;ides the things already mentioned, among other innu|merable In&s;tances, &s;o many of them con&s;enting to have a Fort built at <HI>Pemaquid,</HI> and a &s;tated Salary &s;ettled upon the Governour, and other Officers, by which they had like to have en&s;laved their Country at once.</P>
<P>The Repre&s;entatives are al&s;o to be blamed, in that they do not <HI>Change their Coun&s;ellors.</HI> We know that they want Men fit for Government. Neverthele&s;s, we doubt not but in the large Province of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's,</HI> there may be found an Hundred Men, as fit for Coun&s;ellors, as <HI>S. S.</HI> or <HI>J. C.</HI> or <HI>P. T.</HI> [we deal more tenderly with them, in giving but the Fir&s;t Letters of their Names, than they have dealt with the Honourable <HI>Nathanael Higgin&s;on,</HI> whom they have, by Name at large vilified, as a <HI>Scanda|lous and Wicked Accu&s;er.</HI>] And others, who by their Ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s to <HI>Dudley</HI> have ju&s;tly forfeited the Love of the People.</P>
<P>Had their Repre&s;entative the Wi&s;dom frequently to Change their Coun&s;ellors, it would make them more Careful to &s;tudy the Intere&s;t of their People, and not that &s;o they may plea&s;e their Governour, and Stigmatize better Men than them&s;elves, in their <HI>Boston</HI> News Letter, only becau&s;e they <HI>Slandered</HI> Dudley <HI>in a Matter of Truth.</HI></P>

<P>THAT Honourable Per&s;on before-mentioned, who is here Appearing on the Behalf of one of the <HI>New-Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies, which Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> has been &s;eeking to En&s;lave, &s;aw cau&s;e to Conclude his Petition, with a Com|plaint again&s;t him in the&s;e Terms; <HI>Your Maje&s;ty's Name and Authority is abu&s;ed to &s;erve &s;ome</HI> Dark De&s;igns <HI>of his own.</HI> It &s;eems he has been u&s;ed to <HI>Dark De&s;igns;</HI> but if ever <HI>Dark De&s;igns</HI> were to be &s;u&s;pected, it has been in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of that Late Expedition to <HI>Port-Royal;</HI> an Expedition, that be&s;ides the everla&s;ting Di&s;grace of it, has entirely Ruined the Country, and made it highly Nece&s;&s;ary for another Governour to be &s;ent thither, to re&s;cue that poor People, if it be po&s;&s;ible, from Extirpa|tion. We have pretty <HI>Broad Hints</HI> of an <HI>Unlawful Trade</HI> carried on with the Fort at <HI>Port-Royal.</HI> And be&s;ides the things already mentioned, it is well known, that
<PB N="31" REF="002214_0034_0FDACF1BD57A13D0"><HI>Flags of Truce</HI> pa&s;&s;ed between <HI>Port-Royal</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the Officers of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> were Ob&s;tructed from going aboard tho&s;e Flags of Truce, that &s;o the Trade carried on with the Enemy, might be Concealed. And when Goods have been Siezed on Board the Flags of Truce, they have been again taken out of the Hands of the Officers. But we mu&s;t now proceed to a Sadder Story. The Short of the Story is this. But the <HI>Dark De&s;igns</HI> mu&s;t be left for another Judgment.</P>
<P>When the War fir&s;t broke out, the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> e&s;pecially the Trading part of the Country, and tho&s;e that were more immediately concern'd in the Fi&s;hery, were very Unea&s;y to &s;ee <HI>Port Royal,</HI> which was then of no con&s;iderable Strength, advancing into a Capacity of Di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, if not ruining the Province. It is &s;o near, and &s;o &s;eated, as to have all immaginable Advantage to Anni|mate, and Supply the <HI>Indians,</HI> by <HI>Land;</HI> and by <HI>Sea,</HI> with <HI>Privateers,</HI> to De&s;troy their Fi&s;hery, and Ruin all their other Trade, by intercepting, and taking their Ve&s;&s;els, both Outward and Inward Bound. Their <HI>Fort</HI> was but an <HI>Embryo,</HI> and it was thought they might have been ea&s;ily Suppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The <HI>New-Englanders</HI> under&s;tood by a <HI>Port-Royaller</HI> fal|ing into their Hands, that at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> they had not yet Heard of the War broken out. Whereupon Gover|nour <HI>Dudley</HI> was earne&s;tly Sollicited, and his Leave In|treated by &s;ome, to go and De&s;troy that Ne&s;t of <HI>Hornets,</HI> which was like to be &s;o grievous a growing Plague to the Country; with Offers to rai&s;e Volunteers &s;ufficient for that Purpo&s;e; But the Propo&s;al was rejected; which made People &s;u&s;pect &s;ome <HI>Dark De&s;igns,</HI> and that <HI>Port-Royal</HI> was re&s;erved for &s;ome &s;pecial Advantages not Obvious to the Vulgar.</P>
<P>Afterwards, when the Governour could no longer with|&s;tand the Cry of the Country, Col. <HI>Church</HI> was allow'd to go. The A&s;&s;embly procured a Mortar Piece, and pro|vided Bombs, and other things convenient, and had &s;ome Eye upon the Fort, which was then fini&s;h'd. Yet the &s;aid <HI>Church</HI> not only had the Taking of the <HI>Fort</HI> left out
<PB N="32" REF="002214_0035_0FDACF1D53539DD8">of his Orders, but was po&s;itively <HI>Forbidden</HI> to Meddle|with it. And he hath &s;ince affirm'd to many Gentlemen, that he could with all the Ea&s;e imaginable have Taken the Fort, but that he had been &s;o &s;trictly and menacingly <HI>Forbidden</HI> to meddle with it, that he dur&s;t not; but only ravaged the Naked Country. <HI>Church</HI>'s Soldiers were all <HI>Volunteers,</HI> and an <HI>Ast of the A&s;&s;embly</HI> had promi&s;ed them a certain Share of the Plunder: But the Chief Commanders fir&s;t made a large Pre&s;ent out of it to the Governour; and then <HI>Hs,</HI> joyning with them, cut off the Army of Half that the <HI>Publick Faith</HI> had Engaged them; which it was feared, would have proved a la&s;ting Di&s;couragement to all <HI>Volunteers</HI> for the Service of the Crown and the Country: And the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives Remon&s;trated unto the Governour, this among other Grievances; but were rejected with Ob&s;tinate Contempt.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on pretended by the Governour, for prohibiting <HI>Church's</HI> meddling with the Fort, was, <HI>That he had laid the Matter before the Queen, and had yet received no Orders about it.</HI> Tho' the &s;ame Objection &s;till continued, yet the People being extreamly de&s;irous that a Period might be put to their Mi&s;eries from <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> and a way open'd for the Deliverance of &s;o many Scores of poor <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captives, likely to Langui&s;h for ever in the <HI>Indian Wigwams,</HI> moved for another Expedition above a Year ago. The Governour now gives a Commi&s;&s;ion for Taking the Fort; but whether with any <HI>Dark De&s;igns,</HI> we are yet <HI>in the Dark.</HI> After the In&s;tructions were drawn up, there was a Clau&s;e Tack'd at the End of them, which gave the Army leave to come off when they would, if they &s;hould imagine, they could not pre&s;ently Fini&s;h their Bu&s;ine&s;s to their Minds. It was the Tacking this unob&s;erved Clau&s;e at la&s;t, that confounded all, and brought on a Story, which all the Letters from <HI>New-England</HI> we have yet &s;een, &s;ay, <HI>They Blu&s;h to Write it.</HI> And that is the Rea&s;on why we can give but a Short Account of it. In &s;hort, there was an Army of as likely Men as can be imagined, the be&s;t part of Two Thou&s;and of them; and as well provided with Ammunition, Provi&s;ion, and all things
<PB N="33" REF="002214_0036_0FDACF1ED2870EA8">Nece&s;&s;ary, as a Willing Country could afford. But, when it comes to Execution, quite Contrary to the be&s;t Advice of them who knew the Place, the landed &s;everal Mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> off the Fort, when they might have Landed clo&s;e by, and probably at once have taken it. However, Land they did; and Drove the Enemy before them, and Cha&s;ed them into the Fort with much Courage, and all the Encouragement that could be. The Men, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them Ju&s;tice, Fought like Men, and would have d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any thing in the World. &mdash; But, lo, the I&s;&s;ue! The <HI>Deptford</HI>-Man of War, which was <HI>Commodore</HI> of the Fleet, had Expre&s;s Orders from the Governour, <HI>That he &s;hould not Expo&s;e the Queen's Ship.</HI> Which Orders he afterwards Expo&s;ed in the <HI>Coffee-Hou&s;es.</HI> An Engineer was fetch'd from <HI>New-York,</HI> where the People from the beginning foretold what would be the Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Governour's Younge&s;t Son, <HI>William Dudley,</HI> was there too, in the Quality of a Secretary of War; and tho' he were little more than a <HI>Boy,</HI> yet he was a <HI>Son,</HI> and the Army &s;oon Cry'd out of being <HI>Boy-ridden.</HI> The General, a Man of no Con|duct, having Signaliz'd &s;omething of a <HI>Belluine</HI> Courage in &s;ome <HI>Indian</HI> Encounters, the <HI>Mob</HI> ('tis &s;aid) was &s;et upon having him to be a Commander. They landed as we &s;aid; but then they ne|ver made a <HI>Formal Demand</HI> of the Fort; they never carried a|&s;hore a <HI>Mortar</HI> or a <HI>Field Piece;</HI> they never threw up a <HI>Shovel|ful</HI> of Earth. The Bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;o managed, between certain Per&s;ons, that altho' at a <HI>Council of War,</HI> one Day it was Voted. That the <HI>Fort</HI> &s;hould be attack'd, it was by'nd by, Unvoted again. The Engineer had wrought upon &s;undry Captains, to make 'em Believe, <HI>That the taking of the Fort was Impracticable.</HI> They mo&s;t of them gave it under their Hands to their Wi&s;e General, <HI>That it was their Opinion, it was be&s;t for them to Draw off.</HI> The Soldiers began al&s;o to be Di&s;pirited, for &s;ome had Blabb'd among them a Secret, which, when it came to be known, made them out of their Witts. Tho' it was known and Pub|li&s;hed here in <HI>London,</HI> before the Fleet was Returned from <HI>Port-Royal.</HI> The General A&s;&s;embly had Agreed and Engaged, That if the Fort were taken, it &s;hould immediately be Demo|li&s;hed; and without this A&s;&s;urance the Army would never have proceeded. But <HI>&s;ome Body</HI> now, Indi&s;creetly let'em Under|&s;tand, that the Governour had &s;ome <HI>Dark De&s;igns,</HI> to put a Trick upon them, and had given him Orders not to demoli&s;h the Fort: Whereupon the Inraged Army &s;aid, <HI>They had now nothing to do, but Fight them&s;elves into a Pri&s;on!</HI> They were mo&s;tly Good Livers at Home, and could not bear the Thoughts on't, that half the
<PB N="34" REF="002214_0037_0FDACF2052829238">Army, (no Man knowing whether it might not be his own &s;hare) &s;hould be Confined there one long Winter i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> remote Garri&s;on, and perhaps, Two Winters after that; or until they &s;hould Buy them&s;elves a Relea&s;e upon as hard Terms, as the poor Country Soldiers have, to get out of the Ca&s;tle at <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> Well: A Packet is Di&s;patch'd unto the Governour of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> to Signify their Opinion, and to Pray his Excellency's further Plea&s;ure. But in three or Four Days after the &s;ailing of the Packet, and before it was Po&s;&s;ible for them to hear from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> they drew off in great Confu&s;ion, and Weigh'd Anchor, and came away. But as they were in the mid&s;t of their Di&s;per&s;ion, there came Or|ders to &s;top as many of them, as were together at <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay.</HI> From thence they &s;ent three Per&s;ons to acquaint the Governour with the Mi&s;erable Affair; whereof one was the <HI>Engineer</HI> afore|&s;aid. They had a very melancholly, and almo&s;t a tumultuous Reception by the People; and when they were, at their fir&s;t Land|ing upbraided with Cowardice, their An&s;wer &s;till was, <HI>That the Fault was at Home; and they had gone as far as their Orders would bear them out;</HI> with &s;undry &s;uch Reflections, which bore hard upon the Government. The Council were informed of this Di&s;cour&s;e; But there was no Notice taken of it. And tho' they were Chidden by the Governour, in the Council Chamber, yet we under&s;tand, they were Hugg'd and Care&s;s'd by him below Stairs, to the great Scandal of the People. The People were now in a mighty Ferment. It was the Univer&s;al Opinion, that if the Army had only &s;taid, and Play'd at <HI>Coits</HI> in their Camp (far enough from the Fort) at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> the Fort would have been within a few Days &s;urrendred to them. The Soldiers with|in were Mutinous to the la&s;t Degree; De&s;erters daily came over. Provi&s;ions would have grown Scanty in a little Time. [Tho' the Lodgings of their Men were not now thatch'd; (the Rea&s;on why we told you before) yet a red-hot Bullet or two &s;lung into the Fort, might have &s;et them all on Fire.] Ten thou&s;and things might have happened. But, like Men afraid of having the Fort fall into their Hands, they ran back to <HI>New-England</HI> as fa&s;t as their <HI>Canyas</HI> Sails could carry them.</P>
<P>The Good <HI>Women</HI> in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> could not forbear their Out-cries, when they met in the Streets, on this Occa&s;ion. Says one of them, <HI>Why, our Cowards imagined the Fort at</HI> Port-Royal <HI>would fall before them, like the Walls of</HI> Jericho. Another An&s;wers, <HI>Why did not the Block heads then &s;tay out Seven Days to &s;ee? What a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l'd the Traitors to come away in Five Days Time after they got there?</HI> The Cry of the People mu&s;t be Satisfved. Another Ship of War was fitted our, and Recruits of Soldiers were &s;ent unto the Fleer, which now lay at <HI>Ca&s;co Bay.</HI> Which after Tedious and Ex|pen&s;ive Delays of many Weeks, &s;et Sail from thence again to <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t-Royal,</HI> but with the greate&s;t Aver&s;ion that ever was in the
<PB N="35" REF="002214_0038_0FDACF222829CCA0">Hearts of Men; and not until they had been further weaken<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by many and numerous De&s;ertions. While they were on the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Voyage to <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> a Man of War arrived from <HI>Portugal;</HI> the brave Commander (a <HI>New Englander</HI>) was ready to venture his Ship and Life too on this Occa&s;ion; and chearfully com|plied with Orders which were with &s;ome ado obtained, for him to go to Port-Royal after them. Our Fleet arriving there a Second Time, found that in the time of their withdraw to <HI>Ca&s;co,</HI> the <HI>Port-Royallers</HI> had much Recruited them&s;elves; and had Taken and carried in &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, laden with Provi&s;i|on; and had al&s;o Di&s;patch'd away their Galley for <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, after a little Skirmi&s;h on the oppo&s;ite Shore, and &s;ome Follies not to be mention'd, away they come for <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> without Orders, and before Capt. <HI>Paddon</HI> could have Opportu|nity to come up with them. So that the Second Expedition was as Bad, or Wor&s;e than the Fir&s;t. After the Expedition was thus Shamefully Fini&s;h'd, there was another Difficult <HI>Card</HI> to Play; that was, to <HI>Satisfy the General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> which was then quickly to &s;it. The Way pitch'd upon was, to make a Pretended <HI>Court-Martial,</HI> to Enquire into the Cau&s;e of the Mi&s;manage|ments at <HI>Port-Royal.</HI> This Court was the Ridicule of Town and Country. No Body was Try'd at it, or &s;o much as Accu&s;ed. All was carried on in <HI>Hugger-Mugger.</HI> We can Hear of Nothing done; but the Pre&s;enting of the Secretary of War, <HI>Will. Dudley,</HI> with all the Plunder that was taken, and amounted to between One and Two Hundred Pounds, and then leave to go Home! It is plain, the General was not to be Impeached there; 'tis well, if it has not Ruined the Governour, as well as the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Country, yet we hear the Governour, before the Sitting of the &s;aid Court, gave him an Order for an Advantagious Po&s;t at the <HI>Ea&s;t|ward,</HI> to Build a Fort at <HI>Saco,</HI> becau&s;e he would not Take one at <HI>Port-Royal;</HI> as High and rich a Po&s;t, as he was ever capable of.</P>
<P>And &s;o much for <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> until the <HI>Dark De&s;igns</HI> come into further Light. And then it will be known whether Governour <HI>Dudley</HI> when he &s;aw the Country was Violently &s;et upon going, and &s;o Interrupting his Trade with the <HI>French,</HI> had not a Secret De|&s;ign, that the Fort at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> &s;hould have been made (as the Fort at <HI>Pemaquid</HI> would have been) a Convenient Place for the <HI>Fur-Trade</HI> with the <HI>Indians,</HI> whereby him&s;elf, and &s;ome Friends of his here, in <HI>Britain,</HI> would have got no little Riches. In the mean time, under his Admirable Conduct, an Impoveri&s;h'd Country has, (as we are credibly informed) been put to above Two and Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds Charge, only to be Laughed at by their Enemies, and Pitied by their Friends.</P>
