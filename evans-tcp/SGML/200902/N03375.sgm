<P>_THE great Creator, and Former of all Things, was plea&s;ed at fir&s;t to di&s;tingui&s;h his Goodne&s;s to Man be|yond all other Creatures upon Earth, in making and forming a Soul with|in him, endowed with &s;uch noble Powers and Faculties as gave him a Rank among Beings but little lower than that of Angels; in giving him Dominion over the Creatures of the lower World, and crowning him with Glory and Honour; and that more e&s;pecially by giving him that Knowledge, Rectitude, and Purity of Nature, by which he came to be in the Image and after the Likene&s;s of GOD him&s;elf.&mdash;Moreover GOD planted a Garden, and placed him in it, where he might en|tertain him&s;elf in the mo&s;t delightful Manner, re|galing every Sen&s;e with the mo&s;t delicious Fruits of
<PB N="2" REF="004111_0004_1003B5AF4FCBCED8">
divine Bounty, and entertaining his Soul with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Contemplations upon the wonderful Works of GOD, and the &s;weete&s;t Intercour&s;e and Communion with him. And to crown all there was a Tree of Life, of which, if he had maintained his In|nocence, he might have eaten and lived forever.</P>
<P>But the Devil that &s;ubtle Serpent, envious of the Happine&s;s of Man, and de&s;irous to betray him into the &s;ame Condemnation and Mi&s;ery with him&s;elf, did, by his cunning and fal&s;e Sugge&s;tions, draw him into Sin, whereby he at once undid him&s;elf, defaced the Image and forfeited the Favour of his GOD; was turned out of Paradi&s;e, debar'd the Tree of Life, and expo&s;ed to Death and Ruin forever.</P>
<P>And this would have been the inevitable Fate of humane Nature, had not GOD of his infinite Mercy interpo&s;ed for our Salvation and Recovery, by pro|viding and &s;ending One mighty to Save, and &s;o com|ing upon new Terms in a gracious Covenant, revea|led and propounded to us in his Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>And now altho' the Covenant that GOD has e&s;ta|bli&s;hed with Men in the Blood of his own Son, is full of Grace, and every thing in it may be looked upon as meer Grace; yet ala&s;s! &s;uch Corruption, Stupidity, and Madne&s;s is there in the Hearts of Men, &s;ince the primitive Apo&s;tacy, that there is nothing more difficult than to per&s;wade Men to for&s;ake their Sins, which lead down to the Chambers of Death and De&s;truction, and to comply with the mo&s;t graci|ous and rea&s;onable Terms of Salvation.</P>
<P>The Devil (as it &s;hould &s;eem) found no great Difficulty in &s;educing and per&s;wading our fir&s;t Parents to &s;in: And &s;o to de&s;troy them&s;elves at fir&s;t, but now it requires the utmo&s;t Skill and Wi&s;dom to per&s;wade Men to turn from their evil Ways and live. And all of it will be in&s;ufficient unle&s;s GOD &s;ets in
<PB N="3" REF="004111_0005_1003D368C9CEE8F8">
with his almighty Grace. I &s;ay unle&s;s GOD &s;ets in with his Grace; for although it be the Spirit of GOD that wins and gains a Soul over to him&s;elf, <HI>working in him both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure,</HI> yet it is, at lea&s;t for the mo&s;t Part, by &s;etting in, concur|ring, and co-operating with the outward Means that he has appointed for that End, &s;uch as his Word and Ordinances, e&s;pecially the Mini&s;try thereof, by a certain Order of Men, that he has all along employed for that Service. I mean the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the Go&s;|pel, who&s;e great Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;hew Men the Way to Salvation, and to per&s;wade them to come into it.</P>
<P>And although one would think <HI>this</HI> the ea&s;ie&s;t Thing in Nature, and that the bare propo&s;ing the Thing to rational Creatures would be &s;ufficient, yet daily Experience &s;adly convinces of the contrary, and that there is no Affair that Men are called to be concerned in, that requires greater Skill or Wi&s;dom in the Management of it; and this is what the wi&s;e Man intimates to us in my Text, <HI>And be that winneth Souls is Wi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He that winneth,</HI> or taketh <HI>Souls</HI> with that Skill and Indu&s;try as a Fowler taketh a Bird, for &s;o (as Ex|po&s;itors ob&s;erve) the Word imports. But although it be the &s;ame Word, yet here is the difference, both in the De&s;ign and in the Event of the thing. The Fowler u&s;es his Art to deceive the innocent Bird, to decoy and draw her into a Snare, when &s;he knows not that it is for her Life: Whereas the winning, or taking Souls, is the u&s;ing an innocent and hone&s;t Art to undeceive Men, to per&s;wade a guilty Soul out of the Snare of the Devil, and a State of Sin and Death, into a State of Pardon, and Grace, and eternal Life; and &s;o if they are taken or caught, it is not with Guile or to their Hurt, to their Death and De&s;truction, like the Bird, but to Salvation and Happine&s;s Ac|cordingly
<PB N="4" REF="004111_0006_1003D36DB19D2C00">
a Soul thus taken is <HI>won,</HI> is gained, is &s;aved. And now &s;ays the Preacher he that thus takes, and wins, and gains Souls is <HI>Wi&s;e.</HI> That is either,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1 &s;t. It is a Point of Wi&s;dom to employ our Time and Strength in winning Souls.</HI> It is a great and noble De&s;ign to win <HI>Souls,</HI> to gain and &s;ave precious and immortal <HI>Souls.</HI> There is nothing in which Men can lay out their Time, their Skill, and all their Powers to better Purpo&s;e, than in winning lo&s;t Souls, re&s;cu|ing them out of the Hands of Satan their grand Ad|ver&s;ary, and in bringing them over to Chri&s;t, and into the Way of Salvation and Happine&s;s. It is the be&s;t Work that Men can &s;et them&s;elves about; and con&s;equently he is a wi&s;e Man, that diligently, and in good earne&s;t, lays him&s;elf out herein. Or,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> If we read the Text as &s;ome do, <HI>viz. be that is wi&s;e winneth Souls,</HI> then by being wi&s;e we may un|der&s;tand, <HI>being &s;piritually wi&s;e, or truly religious,</HI> and &s;o make the Meaning of it to be, that he that is truly religious winneth Souls. And it is an undoub|ted Truth that a Man of eminent Piety and Religion, does a great deal towards winning and per&s;wading others over to the Love and Practice of it. And thus &s;ome make the latter Part of the Ver&s;e to corre|&s;pond with the former; <HI>the Fruit of the Righteous is a Tree of Life:</HI> That is, the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the righteous Man produces in his Life and Conver&s;ation, is like a Tree of Life to him&s;elf, as it nouri&s;hes and pre&s;erves his &s;piritual, and &s;ecures his e|ternal Life: And it is a Tree of Life to others, as it greatly contributes to the Support and Nouri&s;hment of a &s;piritual Life in them, animating and encoura|ging them to the Imitation of them in all the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>And be that is wi&s;e winneth Souls,</HI> that is, He that is thus righteous or &s;piritually wi&s;e, wins upon others and gains them over to the Love and Practice of the &s;ame things.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004111_0007_1003D373696A99A0">But then, <HI>3dly. He that winneth Souls is wi&s;e,</HI> may be under&s;tood thus; He that winneth Souls &s;hews him|&s;elf to be wi&s;e, for he mu&s;t needs be wi&s;e that can win and gain Souls; it requires a great deal of Wi&s;dom to do it. They that would win Souls need Wi&s;dom to know how to deal with them, and there is nothing in which their Wi&s;dom appears more con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>And here, although I may take Notice of the two foregoing Sen&s;es of the Text as they fall in my Way, yet, I &s;hall, upon this Occa&s;ion, more e&s;pecially in|&s;i&s;t upon the la&s;t. Accordingly this is the Doctrine for our pre&s;ent Meditation, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That it requires a great deal of Skill and Wi&s;dom to win Souls.</HI></P>
<P>And for the illu&s;trating and confirming this Doc|trine I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I.<HI>What we are to under&s;tand by winning Souls.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II.<HI>That Souls mu&s;t be won, wrought upon, and gained over to Chri&s;t; and not compelled or forced again&s;t their Wills.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III.<HI>That altho' GOD, by his almighty Spirit, wins Souls, yet that it is every Man's Duty to u&s;e his Endeavours to win one another over to Chri&s;t; and that he commits it to &s;ome as their &s;pecial and pe|culiar Bu&s;ine&s;s, even the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV.<HI>Sbew that this is an Affair that requires a great deal of Wi&s;dom and Skill in the Management of it.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. I am to &s;hew <HI>what we are to under&s;tand by win|ning Souls;</HI> about which my Text &s;peaks, and which requires &s;o much Wi&s;dom to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>And here I would an&s;wer in one Word, <HI>That it is an effectual per&s;wading Men to for&s;ake their Sins, and come over to the Faith, the Love, and the Practice of Chri&s;tianity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004111_0008_1003D376E5F3F910">Man by Sin had gone off from GOD, and gone over to the Side of the Devil and of his own Lu&s;ts, to the Love and Tru&s;t, the Wor&s;hip and Service of the Creature, in&s;tead of the Creator of all Things. And by this we have lo&s;t and de&s;troyed our&s;elves. So that the winning of a Soul is the per&s;wading the Man out of this State of Sin and Mi&s;ery, and per|&s;wading him over to GOD, and Chri&s;t, and Holi|ne&s;s. It is a prevailing with Men to repent of all their Sins, to renounce their beloved Lu&s;ts, to turn to GOD, to believe in Chri&s;t with all their Hearts, to accept of him as their Prince and Saviour, and to live as his Grace teaches them, even up to the Prin|ciples and the Precepts of Chri&s;tianity, ordering their Conver&s;ation as becometh the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Now, I &s;ay, the winning of Souls is a <HI>per&s;wading</HI> Men to this, and not forcing them to it contrary to their Wills; it is a pre&s;enting Arguments proper to move and per&s;wade them to it. As the Bird that is taken (to which the Word refers) is by the Skill and Cunning of the Fowler drawn and allured, and not forced to the Snare; the Bird is not hunted and driven to the Place where it is taken, but goes freely and of its own accord, the skilful Fowler having be|forehand laid the alluring Bait, which the Bird no &s;ooner di&s;covers but ha&s;tens to it. Thus the winning of Souls is by pre&s;enting proper Arguments, and per|&s;wading them in a rational Way to come to Chri&s;t, and &s;ubmit unto his Go&s;pel, not deceiving them as the Fowler does the Bird, but rather by undeceiving them, not to de&s;troy but to &s;ave Men.</P>
<P>And when a Soul is thus effectually per&s;waded, then it is won, then it is gained, then it is &s;aved from its lo&s;t and peri&s;hing State, and brought into a State of Grace, &amp; Favour, &amp; Life; a &s;piritual Life here, and in the Way to eternal Life hereafter. And oh! hap|py,
<PB N="7" REF="004111_0009_1003D37A2CFE99B8">
forever happy, the Soul that is thus won &amp; taken! Of &s;uch an one it may be &s;aid, <HI>he was dead but is alive, he was lo&s;t and is found,</HI> Luke 15. 32.</P>
<P N="2">II. I proceed now to &s;how <HI>that Souls mu&s;t be thuswon, and gained over to Chir&s;t, and not compelled or forced again&s;t their Wills.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t remember they are Souls we are treati<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">n of, rational Souls, intellectual Beings, free moral A|gents; and con&s;equently their being won &s;o as to come over to Chri&s;t, mu&s;t be a rational and voluntary Act: for there is no &s;uch thing as a Soul's being won and gained over to Chri&s;t but where there is a free and full Con&s;ent of the Will, which is incompatible with Force or Compul&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Body indeed, or the outward Man, may be forced into the vi&s;ible Kingdom of Chri&s;t; <HI>that</HI> can be forced to be pre&s;ent in chri&s;tian A&s;&s;emblies, and at the publick Wor&s;hip; and &s;ome, who are not for allowing to others the &s;ame Liberty they would un|der the like Circum&s;tances think rea&s;onable for them|&s;elves; have put external Force upon Men in Mat|ters of Religion; but it has been, and I believe it always will be found, to little Purpo&s;e to u&s;e any out|ward Force for driving Men into the Kingdom of GOD.</P>
<P>Indeed our Saviour bids his Servants <HI>go to the high Ways, &amp; to the Hedges, and compel them to come in that his Hou&s;e may he filled,</HI> Luke 14. 23. But what Com|pul&s;ion can we &s;uppo&s;e Chri&s;t to mean here but a rational Compul&s;ion, informing the Under&s;tnding, directing the Judgment, per&s;wading the Will, and exciting the Affections of the Soul towards Chri&s;t and his Go&s;pel? And GOD him&s;elf is repre&s;ented as drawing Men, and not forcing them to Chri&s;t. <HI>No Man can come to me</HI> (&s;ays Chri&s;t) <HI>except the Fa|ther which hath &s;ent me draw him,</HI> John 6.44. And how does he draw us unto Chri&s;t? Why, <HI>with the Cords</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="004111_0010_1003D37BF46D0540">
<HI>of a Man, and with the Bands of Love,</HI> Ho&s;. 11.4. With Cords proper to draw <HI>Men,</HI> rational Beings withal. And what are they but Arguments and Mo|tives proper to work upon our rational Nature, upon the intellectual and moral Faculties of the humane Soul? <HI>In the Day of GOD's Power they are made wil|ling,</HI> P&s;al. 110.3. Although the divine Power is ex|erted upon them, yet it is their own free Act and Deed; they act as freely in their coming over to Chri&s;t, as in any Action what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The Force of humane Laws, of common Cu&s;tom, of worldly Pro&s;pects or Fears, compel many Men to the external Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t and his Go&s;pel, and &s;o to a vi&s;ible Appearance on the Side of Reli|gion; and they who look only at the outward Ap|pearance, may and ought charitably to judge they are won over to Chri&s;t and his Kingdom; but He who&s;e Prerogative it is to <HI>&s;earch the Heart and try the Reins of the Children of Men,</HI> knows the contrary.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Chri&s;t's Kingdom is a &s;piritual Kingdom, that is &s;et up in the Souls of Men; and if he don't reign in Men's Hearts, he will by no Means look upon them as won over to him, nor can they be &s;aid to be gained or &s;aved. And now Chri&s;t don't force him&s;elf upon Men whether they will or no He knocks indeed at the Doors of Men's Hearts by his Word, Ordinances, Providences, and by his Spirit; and he calls and waits for Entrance: but he will have Men to open the everla&s;ting Doors of their Souls in order to his coming in. So that we mu&s;t freely open our Souls unto him, and heartily receive him, and then and not till then, is the Soul won; for as to any external Compul&s;ion, or Motives from any ex|ternal Views, it &s;ignifieth nothing; the Soul may, notwith&s;tanding all &s;uch outward Appearance, be on the Devil's &s;ide, and in a lo&s;t &amp; undone E&s;tate.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="9" REF="004111_0011_1003D37E66E3FA78">III. <HI>I come new to &s;hew, That although GOD by his almighty Grace wins Souls over to Chri&s;t, yet he makes it every Man's Duty to be u&s;ing Endeavours to win one another over to him; and this he com|mits to &s;ome as their &s;pecial and peculiar Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> viz. <HI>the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t briefly &s;ay the&s;e things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>1&s;t. It is GOD by his almighty Spirit and Grace that wins Souls to Chri&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>2dly. Notwith&s;tanding this he expects that we &s;hould all be endeavouring to win one another over to Chri&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>3dly. He commits this to the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel as their &s;pecial and peculiar Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t. It is GOD, by his almighty Spirit and Grace, that wins Souls over to Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>That is, Whenever any are effectually per&s;waded to repent of their Sins, to believe in Chri&s;t, and o|bey his Go&s;pel, it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the Agency and Influence of the divine Spirit. For although the Spirit of GOD don't work forcibly or compul&s;ively, &s;o as to offer any Violence to our rational Nature, or to any of our natural Powers and Faculties, yet he works powerfully and effectually upon them, in a Way that we know not how; much le&s;s can we de&s;cribe it. <HI>For as the Wind bloweth where it li&s;teth, and thou heare&s;t the &s;ound thereof, but cannot tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth, &s;o is every one that is born of the Spirit,</HI> John 3.8. All we can &s;ay is, That &s;ome how or other the Spirit works in and upon our Spi|rits, and wins us over to Chri&s;t in a Way &s;uited to our Nature, and although this Work goes on in &s;uch a natural Way that we can't di&s;cern it to be any thing but a rational Act of our own, yet when we perceive the powerful Effect we may conclude the Spirit of GOD has been at Work.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004111_0012_1003D3841C56CA90">The Way of the divine Spirit is to convince Men of Sin, to bring their Sins &s;o to Remembrance, and to give them &s;uch a lively Sen&s;e hereof, as to excite unfeigned Sorrow, and at length to produce a Re|pentance unto Salvation. He opens al&s;o Men's Eyes, to behold the wondrous Things out of GOD's Law and Go&s;pel, to &s;ee the Glory of Chri&s;t, the a|miablene&s;s of Religion, and the Beauty of Holine&s;s, whereby the Soul is per&s;waded to believe in Chri&s;t, and come into the Love and Practice of Chri&s;tianity, which is the &s;ame with the winning of the Soul.</P>
<P>And now that this Work of Conver&s;ion, or winning the Soul to GOD, is by the divine Agency and In|fluence, is abundantly evident from the Oracles of GOD, there we find GOD a&s;&s;uming it as his Prero|gative <HI>to give a new Heart, and to put within us a right Spirit,</HI> Ezek. 36. 26. And the being Born a|gain, which, is the &s;ame thing, is expre&s;ly &s;aid to be <HI>not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fle&s;h, nor of the Will of Men, but of GOD,</HI> John 1.13. And our coming to Chri&s;t is expre&s;ly declared to be by the divine Influence, and that it can't be without it; <HI>No Man can come to me except the Father which hath &s;ent me draw him,</HI> John 6.44. In a Word, although we are <HI>to work out our Salvation with Fear &amp; Trembling, yet it is GOD that works in us both to Will and to Do of his good Plea&s;ure,</HI> Phil. 2.12, 13. And <HI>&s;uch as are &s;aved, it is by Grace, thro' Faith, and that not of our&s;elves, but it is the Gift of GOD,</HI> Eph. 2.8.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly. Notwith&s;tanding</HI> this, <HI>we &s;hould all be endea|vouring to win one anther over to Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>For although it be GOD that converts, and wins the Soul; yet he does it in and by the U&s;e of Means. And he makes great u&s;e of tho&s;e who are converted, to gain others al&s;o over to Chri&s;t: And he makes it the Duty of all, to be doing what they can in this
<PB N="11" REF="004111_0013_1003D388146004C8">
Matter, nay the very Principle wrought in the Soul that is <HI>won,</HI> will prompt him unto it. He that is converted mu&s;t endeavour to convert and &s;trengthen his Brethren.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e Commandments in the Word of GOD, of in&s;tructing and coun&s;elling, of exhorting and ad|moni&s;hing one another, are &s;o many Injunctions upon us to be doing what we can to per&s;wade others o|ver to Chri&s;t, for they all have a direct Tendency that Way. In a Word, the&s;e two great Command|ments of <HI>loving the Lord our GOD with all our Heart,</HI> &amp;c. and of <HI>loving our Neighbour as our&s;elves,</HI> plainly oblige this. For how can we expre&s;s our Concern for the Honour of GOD and Chri&s;t, &s;o much as by endeavouring to gain others over to Chri&s;t's Kingdom, whereby they may with us glorify our Father which is in Heaven? And how can we &s;o fully &s;hew our Love to our Neighbour, as by en|deavouring all we can to <HI>convert him from the Error of his Ways,</HI> and thereby <HI>to &s;ave his Soul from Death?</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly. GOD commits this Work of winning Souls to the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, as their &s;pecial and peculiar Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Although it be the Duty of every Man, according to his Opportunities and Abilities, to endeavour the Conver&s;ion and Salvation of others; yet as it is a Bu|&s;ine&s;s &s;o difficult, and of &s;uch va&s;t Importance to Men and &s;o apt to be neglected, when it is left indif|ferently to all, that GOD in great Wi&s;dom and Kindne&s;s to Men, has provided an Order of Men, that &s;hould devote them&s;elves to this Service; that &s;hould &s;tudy to acompli&s;h them&s;elves for it, and then give them&s;elves wholly to it. I mean the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, for this is the grand De&s;ign of their Office, to win and gain Souls over to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004111_0014_1003B5B12B8F65D0">To them is <HI>committed the Mini&s;try of Reconciliation, that they</HI> might in <HI>Chri&s;t's Name and Stead, intreat and be&s;eech Men to be reconciled unto GOD,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.18, 20. Their Bu&s;ine&s;s is <HI>to &s;hew Men the Way to Salvation,</HI> and per&s;wade Men to come into it. They are &s;ent <HI>to open Men's Eyes, to turn them from Dark|ne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD, that they may receive Forgivene&s;s of Sins, and Inheri|tance among them that are &s;anctified,</HI> Acts 26. 18.

<P>Moreover that <HI>this</HI> is the grand Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mini&s;|ters, may be argued from every Branch in the mi|ni&s;terial Office, for it has a plain direct Tendency to this. Thus the preaching of the Go&s;pel, which is a principal Part of the Mini&s;ter's Work, What is this for, but to beget Men, through the Go&s;pel, unto Chri&s;t? To open and confirm the great Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, to explain the great Duties of Chri&s;ti|anity, and urge a Compliance with them, from the Arguments and Motives which the Go&s;pel affords; that &s;o they might get into Chri&s;t, and be &s;aved from all Condemnation, and might obtain the Mercy of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto eternal Life.</P>

<P>Finally, What is the de&s;ign of all the faithful Reproofs, the publick and &s;olemn Cen&s;ures of the Church di&s;pen&s;ed by the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, but to reduce and recover Back&s;liders &amp; Revolters, to bring back &s;traying and peri&s;hing Souls to Chri&s;t?

<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t.</HI> Let us con&s;ider, <HI>What it is that the Soul is to be won from;</HI> and this will give us &s;ome View of the Difficulties of it, and &s;o of the Wi&s;dom needful to accomplish it.</P>
<P>And now, in general, it is a winning Men over from their corrupt Nature, from their beloved Lu&s;ts and from tho&s;e evil Practices that they have been long accu&s;tomed unto; it is a per&s;wading Men to change the very Temper of their Minds, and to alter the whole Cour&s;e of Life. The winning a Soul is the per&s;wading a Man from tho&s;e Apprehen&s;ions and Inclinations that are natural to him &s;ince the Fall; it is a per&s;wading him to renounce and abandon all his &s;piritual, and fle&s;hly, and worldly Lu&s;ts, &s;uch as Pride, Malice, Envy, Di&s;content, Unbelief, Cove|teou&s;ne&s;s, Sen&s;uality, and the like, which are natural to the unregenerate Soul, and &s;o dear to him, that it &s;eems as ea&s;y to prevail with him to cut off a right Hand, or to pluck out a right Eye, as to part with them. Moreover, he is per&s;waded to change his
<PB N="15" REF="004111_0017_1003D38C0232B2C8">
Cour&s;e of Life, to for&s;ake the Plea&s;ures of Sin, and the evil Ways that he has been long accu&s;tomed un|to; which &s;eems as difficult for him to do as for the <HI>Ethiopean to change his Skin, and the Leopard his Spot.</HI> He is per&s;waded to break off from the Love and al|lowed Practice of any known Sin, to <HI>hate every evil and fal&s;e Way,</HI> and not &s;uffer any one <HI>Sin to have the Dominion over him:</HI> He is per&s;waded to <HI>depart from his own Iniquity, and to lay a&s;ide every Weight, and the Sin that mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets him,</HI> And now, let any Man judge, Whether it won't require very high Degrees of Wi&s;dom and Skill, to per&s;wade and win Men over to all this.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> Let us con&s;ider, <HI>What the Soul is won over to;</HI> which will be a further Proof of the Point.</P>
<P>And, in general, It is to tho&s;e Things, that are quite contrary to the carnal and corrupt Apprehen|&s;ions and Inclinations of Nature. He that wins a Soul, per&s;wades the Man that was wont to &s;ay unto GOD, <HI>Depart from me, for I de&s;ire not the Knowledge of thy Ways</HI> Job 21.14. now to &s;ay, <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none on Earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee,</HI> P&s;a. 73. 25. And from an&s;wering like proud <HI>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord, that I &s;hould obey his Voice?</HI> Exod. 5.2. He is per&s;waded to that gracious Language of Soul, <HI>What&s;oever the Lord my GOD &s;hall &s;ay unto me, that will I do,</HI> Deut 5.27. And from &s;aying with re&s;pect to Religion &amp; religious Duties, <HI>Behold, What a Wearine&s;s is it? And When will the Sabbath be over? To love GOD's Law, and to rejoice in the Way of his Te&s;timonies, as much as in all Riches; to delight in drawing near to GOD, and e&s;teeming a Day in his Courts better than a Thou&s;and.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, The winning of a Soul, is a per|&s;wading the Man to a Life of Faith in a crucified Saviour, <HI>Which to the Jews was a &s;tumbling Block, and to the Greeks Fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI> And to venture his
<PB N="16" REF="004111_0018_1003D391894FFCC8">
Soul, and the eternal Concerns thereof, with Him, as one able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t. It is a per&s;wading the Soul to live no more by Sight and Sen&s;e, but by Faith; to be looking, not to Things &s;een, which are temporal, but to Things un&s;een, and eternal; all which meets with great Oppo&s;ition from our Pride, Carrnality, and an evil Heart of Unbelief.</P>
<P>Again, The Soul that is won, is per&s;waded <HI>to deny him&s;elf, to take up his Cro&s;s, and follow the Lamb whi|ther&s;oever he goes,</HI> Matth. 16.24. and patiently en|dure the utmo&s;t Hard&s;hips and Difficulties, that he may be called unto for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, which carnal &s;elf Love, Ea&s;e, and Sloth, will very much oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Finally, He is per&s;waded to tho&s;e Things, which corrupt Nature does directly ri&s;e up again&s;t; &s;uch as forgiving Injuries, loving Enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And now, What &s;hort of the utmo&s;t Wi&s;dom and Skill mu&s;t it be, to per&s;wade Men to this?</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> But then, let us con&s;ider, <HI>What &s;ubtle and powerful Oppo&s;ers we have to deal with in this Matter.</HI></P>
<P>And here we don't <HI>wre&s;tle</HI> again&s;t corrupt Nature, again&s;t <HI>Fle&s;h and Blood only, but again&s;t Principalities, a|gain&s;t Powers, again&s;t the Rulers of the Darkne&s;s of this World, again&s;t &s;piritual Wickedne&s;&s;es in high Places,</HI> Eph. 6.12. The Devil, that old Serpent, with his Subtilty and Malice, &s;tole Man away from GOD at fir&s;t, and he, with all his cur&s;ed Legions, is u&s;ing all their Skill and Policy, to prevent our returning to GOD again. And, Oh! the innumerable Wiles, and &s;ubtle Devices of tho&s;e gho&s;tly Adver&s;aries, to keep their hold of us, and hinder us from returning to GOD, and to our Happine&s;s; which Mini&s;ters mu&s;t be aware of, to obviate and an&s;wer, if they would win and recover Souls out of their Hands. And what a Multitude of Ways, mu&s;t the natural Subtil|ty
<PB N="17" REF="004111_0019_1003B5B6E0846AC8">
and long Experience of tho&s;e malicious Spirits have found out, to keep Men under &s;trong Delu&s;ions, and prevent their harkening to the Voice of the Charmer, altho' he charms never &s;o wi&s;ely?</P>
<P>But then, Be&s;ides the &s;ubtle In&s;inuations of Satan, there are the continual Inticements, and earne&s;t So|licitations of Sinners, the bewitching Examples of the Wicked, the aluring Baits of the World, &s;uch as the Riches, the Honours, &amp; the Plea&s;ures of it: The Sophi&s;try and Cunning of Infidels, the peculiar Difficulties of &s;ome Men's Tempers, their Circum|&s;tances, their Employments, their Education, and their Cu&s;toms; which all con&s;pire to oppo&s;e and hin|der Men from returning to GOD, and to their Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>And now, When we lay all the&s;e Things together, and at the &s;ame Time con&s;ider, how corrupt Nature is on the &s;ame Side, and prejudiced in favour of e|very Argument or Pretence that Way, that has the lea&s;t Degree of Plau&s;iblene&s;s in it, and we &s;hall &s;ee that it needs even the Skill of Angels, to know how to manage with Men, &s;o as to win them over to Chri&s;t; and con&s;equently, that the wi&s;e&s;t of Men mu&s;t needs be &s;ometimes po&s;ed and nonplus'd, &s;o as not to know what to do with Sinners, or what Methods to take to gain them, and if it was not for the Supply of Wi&s;dom and Grace, from the Fountain hereof, they would ea&s;ily be outwitted, and over|matched by tho&s;e &s;piritual Wickedne&s;&s;es in high Places.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>I proceed now to give &s;ome Account of that Wi&s;|dom and skill, that is nece&s;&s;ary for the winning souls.</HI></P>
<P>As for Wi&s;dom in general, it con&s;i&s;ts in propo&s;ing &s;ome good End, and in projecting; and pur&s;uing the mo&s;t proper Methods for accompli&s;hing the &s;ame
<PB N="18" REF="004111_0020_1003D393E846F960">
And the higher the End propo&s;ed, and the more difficult to accompli&s;h it, the more Con&s;picuous is the Wi&s;dom in attaining the End.</P>
<P>And now, As to the winning Souls, What nobler End can we propo&s;e? What can we aim at better, than to gain Souls over to Chri&s;t, to re&s;cue them out of the Hands of Satan, and deliver them out of the dreadful Bondage they are in to Sin and Death, and bring them into the glorious Liberties of the Sons of GOD? This is the way to bring Glory to GOD and Chri&s;t, to &s;ave Souls, precious and immortal Souls, from future everla&s;ting Wrath &amp; Mi&s;ery, &amp; bring them into a State of eternal Life and Happine&s;s. So that the Skill and Wi&s;dom here to be de&s;cribed, is <HI>that</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in taking the be&s;t, and the mo&s;t likely Methods to win Souls.</P>
<P>And, Here I &s;hall hint at &s;everal Points of Wi&s;|dom, which &s;eems highly convenient, if not ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary, for tho&s;e who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to win Souls, if they would carry it on to any good Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>It is highly requi&s;ite that &s;uch be well acquainted with the Religion they are to win Souls over to; and well skilled in the Arguments, proper to be made u&s;e of to per&s;wade them to it.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;eems to be the Foundation of all the after Acts of Wi&s;dom that Men are to exerci&s;e in this Matter, and without this it is impo&s;&s;ible to manage the Affair with any Wi&s;dom. It is highly requi&s;ite in order to our managing any Affair after a proper Manner, that we under&s;and the Bu&s;ine&s;s we are going about, or, ten to one, we &s;hall commit &s;ome fatal Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>So he that undertakes to win Souls, if he be wi&s;e, and would not mi&s;carry in his De&s;igns, will take Care before hand to under&s;tand his Bu&s;ine&s;s, that is the Nature and the Importance of it, and what is the
<PB N="19" REF="004111_0021_1003D3535760CD60">
mo&s;t likely Way to manage it to good Effect. He mu&s;t under&s;tand the pre&s;ent wretched and mi&s;erable State of Souls by rea&s;on of Sin, mu&s;t be acquainted with the glorious Remedy that is provided for poor peri&s;hing Souls, and what they mu&s;t be brought over to, in order to their being &s;aved; and he mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with tho&s;e Arguments that are mo&s;t proper to work upon &s;uch &s;inful &s;tupid Souls, mo&s;t likely to awaken them, and to per&s;wade them out of their wretched State.</P>
<P>And as tho&s;e Things are mo&s;t &s;urely and clearly revealed in the holy Scriptures, &s;o it mu&s;t needs be a point of Wi&s;dom for every one that is de&s;igning this Bu&s;ine&s;s, to get well acquainted with them. <HI>They are given by In&s;piration of GOD, and are profitable, for Doc|trine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s; that the Man of GOD may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good Works,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.16. And no Work do they &s;o particularly furni&s;h Men for, as this of winning Souls. They give us an Ac|count of the primitive Apo&s;tacy of Man, and of the deplorable State that we are brought into by re|a&s;on thereof: They reveal Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the glorious Re|medy provided for a peri&s;hing World; which Things the World would have remained ignorant of to this very Day, if it had not been for tho&s;e &s;acred Wri|tings: They &s;hew us the Path of Life: They lead us to Chri&s;t: They tell us what we mu&s;t believe, and what we mu&s;t do to be &s;aved. And they pre&s;ent the mo&s;t moving Arguments to win our Souls; Ar|guments to work upon our Judgments, our Wills, our Affections, our Hopes, our Fears, and upon e|very Power of the Soul. And &s;o in &s;hort, <HI>they are able to make us wi&s;e unto Salvation, through Faith that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 2 Tim 3.15. So that it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to a Man's being qualified to win

Souls, That he be well acquainted with the holy Scrip|tures, &amp; that not barely with the Words of Scripture, &amp; to have the Bible &s;o in our Memories as to be able to &s;ay a great Part of it by Rote, &amp; quote Chapter &amp; Ver&s;e: But &s;uch as undertake the Bu&s;ine&s;s of winning Souls, &s;hould under&s;tand the true Sen&s;e &amp; Meaning of the Scrip|tures in general; I &s;ay in general, becau&s;e it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, That Mini&s;ters &s;hould be able to under&s;tand every Part of Scripture; for if one of the Apo&s;tles could &s;ay, with re&s;pect to the Epi&s;tles of another, that there were in them <HI>&s;ome Things hard to be under&s;tood,</HI> 2 Pet. 3.16. it will be no Wonder if there &s;hould be many Things in their Writings beyond us to under&s;tand: and it &s;hews a Want of Mode&s;ty, as well as Judgment, for any to pretend to a full Under&s;tanding of every Part of Scripture, or to think it nece&s;&s;ary that every Part be under&s;tood by us; it is &s;ufficient for us, that the nece&s;&s;ary Points are &s;o clearly revealed, as that with diligent Study, comparing one Part of Scripture with another, we may come to the Knowledge of them: And this every Mini&s;ter &s;hould labour after.</P>
<P>And, In order to this, &s;ome Acquaintance with the Languages that the Scriptures were originally written in, and with the expo&s;itory Notes of learned Men upon the Scriptures, with eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, and many other Parts of Learning, is very convenient, and needful to a Man's being <HI>an able Mini&s;ter of the new Te&s;tament, and a workman that need not to be a&s;hamed.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, Such as would be well accompli&s;hed to win Souls, &s;hould be able to di&s;tingui&s;h between Truth and Error; between nece&s;&s;ary and unnece&s;&s;ary Points; between the weightier and the le&s;s weighty Matters of the Law and Go&s;pel; between Fundamentals and Circum&s;tantials; between the Form and the Power of Godline&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="004111_0023_1003D3A136222B58">It is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;uch be able to open and con|firm the great Doctrines of the Go&s;pel again&s;t Infi|dels, and for the Conviction of Gain-&s;ayers; to ex|plain the Duties of Chri&s;tianity; and furni&s;hed with proper Arguments to pre&s;s them upon the Con&s;ci|ences of Men, &s;ilencing their Cavils, an&s;wering their Objections and Excu&s;es, removing Stones of &s;tum|bling, or Rocks of Offence, out of the Way.</P>
<P>Thus a Man that devotes him&s;elf to the Service of Chri&s;t and of Souls, mu&s;t be a <HI>ready Scribe, well in|&s;tructed to the Kingdom of GOD,</HI> Matth. 13.32.

<P>How can that Man urge the great Arguments of the Go&s;pel with Fervency and Force, that has never been moved by them him&s;elf?

<P>Mini&s;ters mu&s;t know how to behave them&s;elves in the Hou&s;e of GOD, which is the Church of the li|ving GOD. All the Mini&s;trations of GOD's Hou&s;e mu&s;t be managed &s;o as to have a direct Tendency to this grand End of their Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Thus, As Mini&s;ters are employed to be the Mouth of the People to GOD in the publick Prayers; &s;o the&s;e mu&s;t be carried on in &s;uch a Manner as will be&s;t An&s;wer the End of that great Duty of Prayer. They mu&s;t &s;o order their Speech and their Beha|viour in Prayer, as will be mo&s;t likely to command the Attention, excite the Reverence, and rai&s;e the Devotion of the People. They mu&s;t wi&s;ely accom|modate their Confe&s;&s;ions to the Sins, their Petitions and Interce&s;&s;ions to the Wants, their Thank&s;givings to the Mercies of the People; and &s;hould mention nothing in Prayer but what the A&s;&s;embly that hear may and ought to join with them in.</P>
<P>And then, as to Preaching, which is a principal Part of the publick Service, there is great Wi&s;dom requi&s;ite in the managing of it, &s;o as that the Word might prove a Savour of Life unto Life unto them that hear it. And now, as in <HI>preaching,</HI> Mini&s;ters are to <HI>Teach, Exhort,</HI> and <HI>Rebuke;</HI> &s;o in all the&s;e the Preacher mu&s;t manage with great Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P N="1">1st. <HI>Mini&s;ters mu&s;t</HI> TEACH <HI>the People with Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, In teaching the Doctrines and Duties of the Go&s;pel, Mini&s;ters mu&s;t take care that they don't mi&s;take the Doctrines and Commandments of Men, for the Doctrines and Commandments of Men, for the Doctrines and Commandments of GOD our Saviour. And here, although Mini&s;ters may not
<PB N="24" REF="004111_0026_1003D3A6FA73A750">
&s;hun to declare the whole Coun&s;el of GOD, &s;o far as it is made known unto them; yet they mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h and in&s;i&s;t chiefly upon the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and im|portant Points of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>And, Here I would take the Opportunity to &s;ay, That as for the <HI>&s;ublime my&s;terious Doctrines of the Go&s;pel,</HI> they &s;hould always be treated with great Re|verence and Caution; and in tho&s;e Articles, if Mi|ni&s;ters would be wi&s;e, they wont pretend <HI>to be wi&s;e above what is written.</HI> But the deeper and darker the Point is, the more clo&s;ely mu&s;t they adhere to the written Oracles of GOD; to which <HI>they will do well</HI> (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) <HI>to take heed, as unto a Light that &s;hineth in a dark Place,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.19. And, I cannot but think this has been the Fault on all Sides, that they have departed, &s;ome more and &s;ome le&s;s, from the written Word, in their di&s;cour&s;ing upon, and undertaking to explain the My&s;teries of the Go&s;|pel; and each Party has been more fond of &s;uppor|ting his own particular Terms, and Manner of Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, than to &s;it down contented with the Doc|trines, as the Holy Gho&s;t has delivered them unto us; by which Means, in&s;tead of winning Souls over to Chri&s;t, they only win them over to a particular Par|ty; which very Thing has divided the chri&s;tian World into innumerable Sects. Whereas, if Mi|ni&s;ters, and other Chri&s;tians, had, in all their Di&s;cour|&s;es upon my&s;terious Points, laid a&s;ide humane Expli|cations and adhered to the Word, as a <HI>Lamp unto their Feet, and a Light their Paths,</HI> P&s;al. 119.105. tho&s;e unhappy Divi&s;ions might have been in a great Mea&s;ure prevented.</P>
<P>The <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of GOD, <HI>the Manner of the divine sub|&s;i&s;tence,</HI> the <HI>Decrees</HI> of GOD, and the <HI>Manner of his Operation upon his Creatures,</HI> e&s;pecially upon <HI>moral
<PB N="25" REF="004111_0027_1003B5BA63C00DC8">
Agents,</HI> are &s;ome of the <HI>deep Things of GOD, which the Spirit of GOD alone can &s;earch out,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.10.</P>
<P>And therefore, The Mini&s;ter that is &s;o wi&s;e as to know him&s;elf, will have &s;uch a mode&s;t humble Sen&s;e of his own Weakne&s;s and Ignorance about the&s;e Things, as to take up contented with the Words of the Holy Gho&s;t, believing that they &s;et the&s;e Things in the true&s;t and be&s;t Light, and go &s;o far as we are capable of under&s;tanding, or, as is nece&s;&s;ary for us to under&s;tand; and that mo&s;t, if not all, humane At|tempts to explain tho&s;e Points, have rather darkned than enlightned them; being Words <HI>without Know|ledge, which darken Coun&s;el,</HI> Job. 38.2.</P>
<P>So, that if the Preacher be wi&s;e, when he &s;peaks of tho&s;e Things, he will chu&s;e rather to &s;peak of them <HI>in the Words which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth, com|paring &s;piritual Things with &s;piritual;</HI> than in the <HI>Words which Man's Wi&s;dom teacheth,</HI> agreable to the Apo&s;tles own Practice, as he tells us, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.13.</P>
<P>But, to proceed, We are told, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 12.9. that <HI>becau&s;e the Preacher was wi&s;e, he &s;till taught the Peo|ple Knowledge:</HI> Or, as it is in the Margin of &s;ome Bi|bles, <HI>the more wi&s;e the Preacher was, he &s;till taught the Peo|ple Knowledge.</HI> So that he is the wi&s;e Preacher that endeavours to be In&s;tructive in his preaching. He is the <HI>Pa&s;tor after GOD's own Heart, that feeds the People with Knowledge and Under&s;tanding,</HI> Jer. 3.15. that don't turn the People off with unintelligible Terms, dark Phra&s;es, and ob&s;cure Rea&s;onings; but will, as the Apo&s;tles &s;ays they did, <HI>u&s;e great Plainn&s;s of Speech,</HI> 2 Cor. 3.12. I don't mean by this, that Men &s;hould u&s;e bald Expre&s;&s;ions, and homely Simi|litudes; but &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as will be&s;t &s;erve to con|vey the cleare&s;t Ideas of the Point they are di&s;cour|&s;ing, in the mo&s;t agreeable Manner.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="004111_0028_1003D3AF1F1FB278"><HI>La&s;tly</HI> under this Head, The Preacher that is wi&s;e will endeavour <HI>to make full Proof of h

For, as it is when the Word is <HI>mixed with Faith,</HI> that it becomes profitable to the Souls of Men; &s;o it is highly proper that the Preacher &s;hould pre&s;ent them with proper Arguments, as a Foundation for their Faith, even &s;uch Proofs as the Nature of the Subject will afford, and &s;uch as the People may per|cieve the Force of.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> But then, As Mini&s;ters <HI>are to give Attendance to</HI> EXHORTATION, as well as Doctrine, &s;o there is a particular Skill and Wi&s;dom requi&s;ite in managing <HI>this,</HI> &s;o as to win Souls.</P>
<P>This is that Part of preaching which is directed immediately to the Con&s;ciences of Men, per&s;wading and urging them to that Faith, and Love, and Ho|line&s;s, which will be Salvation unto them. And now here it is requi&s;ite that Mini&s;ters &s;hould be skil|led in all the Arts of Per&s;wa&s;ion; and that they be Ma&s;ter of all tho&s;e Arguments that are apt to &s;trike the Minds and Con&s;ciences of Men; and of that Rhetorick too, which will &s;trike the Pa&s;&s;ions; for as the whole Soul is to be won, &s;o there ought to be a moving Addre&s;s to all the Powers and Faculties, to every Pa&s;&s;ion and Affection the Soul.</P>
<P>The Preacher that was wi&s;e &s;ought to find out <HI>acceptable Words,</HI> Eccl. 12.10 <HI>Words of Delight,</HI> as in the Margin: Words that delight and plea&s;e the Soul, which wou'd wonderfully allure and attract it. And we all find by Experience, that the Soul is charmed and captivated by the pungent and pathetick Strains of the Preacher, that has wi&s;ely ordered his Speech for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>He therefore, that is wi&s;e, will &s;eek out &s;uch ac|ceptable Words; which, by the Way, teaches how far they are from managing this Matter with Wi&s;|dom,
<PB N="27" REF="004111_0029_1003D3B913CF6170">
who, in&s;tead of &s;eeking out acceptable Words, &s;eek out no Words at all before-hand, but turn the People off with extemporaneous Di&s;cour&s;es, and con|&s;equently with tho&s;e Words that come uppermo&s;t, and tho&s;e delivered in a confu&s;ed, he&s;itating, and hobling Manner, which creates an Unea&s;ine&s;s rather than Plea&s;ure in the Hearers, and &s;o will be very unlikely to win upon them.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> As Mini&s;ters are to REBUKE, as well as Exhort, in their preaching; &s;o it requires as much Wi&s;dom to manage it properly, and &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to an&s;wer the End of winning Souls, as any Part of the Sermon.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters are <HI>to cry aloud, &amp; not to &s;pare; to &s;hew to the Hou&s;e of</HI> Jacob <HI>their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and to</HI> I&s;rael <HI>their Sins.</HI> But to do this in a Manner that will an|&s;wer the De&s;ign, requires peculiar Skill. The Mi|ni&s;ter mu&s;t be faithful, but not too &s;evere, in publick Reproofs. So plain, as that every one that is guilty may ea&s;ily apply it to him&s;elf; and yet not &s;o particu|lar as publickly to expo&s;e Men's Characters, where the Crimes are private. He mu&s;t duly expo&s;e the Sirs and Vices of the People, &s;etting them forth in the cleare&s;t Colours, repre&s;enting their evil Nature, and warning them of the fatal Con&s;equences of Sin: But yet, this mu&s;t be done in a Way that will convince and &s;often, and melt Men down into Repentance, rather than irritate, and &s;o harden them in their Sins. It mu&s;t be managed &s;o as will be&s;t &s;erve to excite within Men a ju&s;t Sen&s;e and Hatred of their Sins; and at the &s;ame time, an higher E&s;teem and Love for the wi&s;e Reprover. And, <HI>as an Ear Ring of Gold, and an Ornament of fine Gold; &s;o is a wi&s;e Re|pr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">ver, upon an obedient Ear,</HI> Prov. 25.12. And thus much for the Wi&s;dom of the Preacher.</P>
<P>And as for the other Mini&s;trations of GOD's Hou&s;e: I mu&s;t but ju&s;t hint at the Wi&s;dom that is
<PB N="28" REF="004111_0030_1003D3C0964E48F0">
requi&s;ite to the Management of <HI>the&s;e</HI> &s;o as will be&s;t an&s;wer the gracious In&s;titutions of them.</P>
<P>Thus, as to the admini&s;tring BAPTISM and the LORD'S SUPPER, Mini&s;ters mu&s;t in&s;truct in the Nature and De&s;ign of the&s;e holy Ordinances; mu&s;t give due Invitation and Encouragement to Per&s;ons to at|tend upon them, and at the &s;ame Time, warning them of the Danger of coming in a prophane, care|le&s;s, and unworthy Manner; and they mu&s;t wi&s;ely di&s;tingui&s;h between the clean and the unclean, the fit and the unfit Subjects of the&s;e Ordinances.</P>
<P>And then, In the Admini&s;tration of the&s;e Ordinances, Mini&s;ters mu&s;t behave with that Gravity, with that Seriou&s;ne&s;s, and with that Devotion, as may &s;erve to excite and influence the Devotion of others, where|by the De&s;ign of the&s;e &s;acred In&s;titutions will be&s;t be an&s;wered. And here, in particular, as the De&s;ign of the <HI>holy Supper</HI> is to give Men a lively Remembrance of the dying Love of our dear Redeemer, &s;o this &s;acred Fe&s;tival &s;hould be &s;o celebrated, and all the Parts of the In&s;titution &s;o managed, as may &s;erve to excite the mo&s;t lively and affecting Remembrance of Him.</P>
<P>And then, As to the CENSURES of the Church, di&s;|penced by the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, (&s;uch as publick Admonitions, Su&s;pen&s;ions, and Excommunications) I would &s;ay, that as this Authority was not given <HI>for De&s;truction,</HI> but for <HI>Edification;</HI> &s;o Mini&s;ters mu&s;t endeavour to manage it in &s;uch a Manner as will be mo&s;t likely to an&s;wer this End, <HI>viz.</HI> That in &s;uch <HI>a De&s;truction of the Fle&s;h, the Spirit might be &s;aved in the Day of the Lord Je&s;us,</HI> 1 Cor 5.5. Furthermore, Al|tho' we mu&s;t be faithful to our &s;traying Brethren, yet we mu&s;t deal and let them &s;ee that we deal tenderly with them: Altho' we may nor neglect them, yet we may not be too ha&s;ty or &s;evere in our publick
<PB N="29" REF="004111_0031_1003D3C81BAAB3E0">
Cen&s;ures of them. But we mu&s;t <HI>exhort and rebuke with all long &s;uffering.</HI> And there we mu&s;t take Care that nothing of this Nature be done <HI>by Partiality;</HI> and yet a <HI>Difference</HI> is to be made, according to the Na|ture and Aggravations of the Offence. Let there be no eccle&s;ia&s;tical Pro&s;ecutions <HI>thro' Strife, vain Glory,</HI> or any private Pique or Revenge, <HI>but in lowline&s;s of Mind,</HI> Phil. 2.3. In a Word, Every Admonition and Cen&s;ure of the Church, mu&s;t be managed with &s;uch a Spirit of Meekne&s;s, Love, and Tenderne&s;s, as may &s;often and melt the Offender into Repentance. And thus much for the Wi&s;dom requi&s;ite in the pub|lick Mini&s;trations of GOD's Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall briefly Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> The Wi&s;dom needful for Mini&s;ters <HI>in their private Application to Souls.</HI></P>
<P>There is often times Occa&s;ion for Mini&s;ters to apply them&s;elves privately and per&s;onally to Men. Such as are under Convictions and Concern about their &s;piritual State, will repair to their &s;piritual Guides for Coun&s;el and Comfort: And others that are &s;tupid and carele&s;s about their Souls, it is no Ways improper for Mini&s;ters to go to them; and doubtle&s;s pa&s;toral Vi&s;its, if they be managed wi&s;ely, may be of great Advantage. And &s;ince it is the Mini&s;ter's Bu&s;ine&s;s and Calling to <HI>win Souls,</HI> it &s;eems very proper that what Time they can &s;pare from their Studies and pub|lick Labours, and other nece&s;&s;ary Avocations, they &s;hould devote to the Service of particular Souls.</P>
<P>But now here is a great deal of Wi&s;dom nece&s;&s;ary to manage &s;uch private Conferences &amp; Conver&s;ation to good Advantage. Here Mini&s;ters mu&s;t con&s;ider the particular Tempers, Circum&s;tances, and Cond|itions of Men that they conver&s;e with, applying Coun&s;els, Comforts, Cautions, Warnings, and Re|proofs, as they &s;ee the Per&s;ons need, and that will
<PB N="30" REF="004111_0032_1003D3CEB66BAO18">
be likely to do them good. We mu&s;t con&s;ider whe|ther Men's Tempers be quick and ha&s;ty, proud and haughty; whether they be humble and meek; whe|ther they be &s;elf-conceited and &s;piritually proud; whether they be dejected or di&s;couraged; and mu&s;t addre&s;s our&s;elves to them accordingly. Moreover we mu&s;t con&s;ider what particular Sins they are addicted to; and mu&s;t faithfully, but in the mo&s;t friendly Manner, warn and admoni&s;h them thereof. We mu&s;t find out the particular Difficulties and Objections in their Way of coming to Chri&s;t, wi&s;ely adju&s;ting our Coun&s;els and Arguments to the Circum&s;tances and Capacities of Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Moreover Mini&s;ters, if they would be wi&s;e, mu&s;t watch for favourable Opportunities to per&s;wade Men over to Chri&s;t; &s;uch as times of Sickne&s;s and Dan|ger, times of Sorrow and Mourning; &s;o al&s;o, when they have experienced remarkable Pre&s;ervations and Deliverances. In a Word, as there are <HI>favourable Opportunities, happy Junctures,</HI> for &s;peaking to Per|&s;ons of their &s;piritual Concerns, &s;o Mini&s;ters &s;hould watch for them, and by no Means let them &s;lip. But I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to another general In&s;tance of Wi&s;|dom nece&s;&s;ary in Mini&s;ters, in order to their winning Souls, and that is,</P>
<P N="3">3 dly. <HI>Their being very</HI> EXEMPLARY <HI>in their Lives and Conver&s;ations.</HI></P>
<P>This is a main Point, without which, all the re&s;t will &s;ignify little: For if a Man prays and preaches, and di&s;cour&s;es at all times, as it were, with the Tongue of Angels, yet, to what Purpo&s;e will it all be, if he contradicts it by his own Practice? And I know nothing that brings a greater Reproach upon Reli|gion, and that &s;o effectually fru&s;trates the grand De|&s;ign of the Mini&s;try, as the corrupt Practices and un|exemplary Behaviour of tho&s;e who have worn that
<PB N="31" REF="004111_0033_1003D3D89601BA60">
&s;acred Character. For how is it po&s;&s;ible that a People &s;hould be per&s;waded and wrought upon by the pre|aching of tho&s;e whom they &s;ee are not at all wrought upon by their own Arguments, and openly reject their own Coun&s;els and Warnings? And truly, what can look &s;o ab&s;urd as to hear Mini&s;ters crying down this and the other Sin on the Sabbath, and yet live in the allowed Practice of them, all the Week af|ter? How reproachful mu&s;t it needs be to Mini&s;ters, and what a Di&s;credit to Religion, for them to teach one thing and practice the quite contrary? <HI>Thou that Preache&s;t a Man &s;hould not &s;teal, do&s;t thou &s;teal? Thou that &s;aye&s;t a Man &s;hould not commit Adultery, do&s;t thou commit Adultery? Thou that abborre&s;t Idols, do&s;t thou commit Sacrilege?</HI> Rom. 2 21 22.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord wi&s;ely con&s;idered the great Ad|vantage of a good Example; and &s;o exhibited a mo&s;t perfect Pattern to the World in his own Life, and gives it in expre&s;s Charge to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>to let their Lights &s;o &s;hine before Men, that others might &s;ee their good Works, and glorify their Father which is in Heaven,</HI> Mat. 5.16. And agreable to this the A|po&s;tle Charges his Son <HI>Timothy,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>Let no Man de&s;pite thy Youth, but be thou an Example to the Belie|vers, in word, in Conver&s;ation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity,</HI> 1 Tim. 4.12. Ob&s;erve here the Way that the Apo&s;tle advi&s;es young <HI>Tim thy</HI> to take that he might not be de&s;pi&s;ed, was to be Exemplary in the Spirit and Temper of his Mind, and in the whole Conduct and Behaviour of him&s;elf; and there is no other Way that will &s;ave Mini&s;ters from Con|tempt; nor any Way &s;o likely for them to win upon the Souls of others. What is there that will give &s;uch Force to their exhortations, and that will re|commend Religion to the E&s;teem the Love and Practice of others, as to &s;ee all the Vertues and
<PB N="32" REF="004111_0034_1003D3DE50AA6F08">
Graces of it exempli&s;ied in the Mini&s;ter's own Life? When does Religion appear &s;o amiable, as when we &s;ee it drawn to the Life in a Man's Temper and Be|haviour?</P>
<P><HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> that is Religion, <HI>makes a Man's Face to &s;hine.</HI> And how glorious does a Mini&s;ter &s;hine a|mong a People, when his Life and Conver&s;ation is but a Tran&s;cript of his Preaching? Verily it is not ea&s;y to conceive how &s;uch a Man would win upon a People. Therefore this is a grand Point for Mi|ni&s;ters to take Care of in their fir&s;t &s;etting out, as the Way to &s;ave them from Contempt, to honour their Character, and to <HI>adorn the Doctrine of GOD their Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>But here, with re&s;pect to a Mini&s;ter's <HI>Conver&s;ation,</HI> there is Wi&s;dom and Prudence to be exerci&s;ed: For as Mini&s;ters may not be <HI>light and vain</HI> in their Con|ver&s;ation, &s;o they mu&s;t avoid the other Extreme of <HI>a m ro&s;e affected Gravity;</HI> for this di&s;a&s;&s;ects People to Religion, as much as too great Levity. Nor are Mini&s;ters to be &s;uperciliou&s;ly brow-beating every thing in Company that promotes an innocent and civil Mirth. On the other Hand, They mu&s;t take heed that they don't countenance, much le&s;s promote <HI>that</HI> which is <HI>filthy</HI> or <HI>prophane.</HI></P>
<P>Mini&s;ters may be plea&s;ant in Company, as well as other Men, &s;o long as they ob&s;erve proper Sea&s;ons, and keep within the Bounds of Civility and Chri&s;ti|anity. There is a Time to <HI>Laugh,</HI> as well as a Time to <HI>Mourn;</HI> and Religion is not to be repre&s;ented in &s;uch gloomy Colours, as to forbid every Thing that excites a civil Mirth; for this would di&s;courage, ra|ther than allure Men to Religion.</P>
<P>Furthermore, Mini&s;ters would do well to con&s;ider their Age and &s;tanding in the World: And, as el|der Mini&s;ters, according to the natural Tendency
<PB N="33" REF="004111_0035_1003D3E9300DD1A0">
of Age, &s;hould lay a&s;ide the Gaiety and Mirth that is natural to Youth; &s;o young Mini&s;ters, although they &s;hould be of a grave Behaviour, yet &s;hould not pretend to a&s;&s;ume, in all Re&s;pects, the Gravity of old Age, lea&s;t it &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected to be mere Affecta|tion, which would prevent its an&s;wering any good End.</P>
<P N="4">4 thly. <HI>Another Point of Wi&s;dom nece&s;&s;ary to the win|ning Souls, is DILIGENCE.</HI></P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s of winning Souls requires a clo&s;e and con&s;tant Application: And he that deals with a &s;lack Hand in this Matter, will do but little to the Purpo&s;e. Mini&s;ters, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to win Souls, &s;hould endeavour that no one Soul committed to their Charge &s;hould peri&s;h thro' their Neglect. And con|&s;idering the great Number of Souls, the various Circum&s;tances and Conditions of them, and the va&s;t variety of Means that mu&s;t be u&s;ed with them, the Mini&s;ter will find that he mu&s;t be very indu&s;tri|ous, or &s;ome of them will &s;uffer.</P>
<P>It becomes Mini&s;ters, as much as any Men in the World, to be &s;o wi&s;e as to <HI>redeem the Time;</HI> to watch and improve all Opportunities for doing Good to the Souls of Men. If we con&s;ider the whole Circle of a Mini&s;ter's Work, both in his private Studies, his private Conferences, &amp; in his publick Admini&s;trations, and it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to be faithful unle&s;s he be diligent.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters, young Mini&s;ters e&s;pecially, mu&s;t give diligent Attendance to reading and &s;tudy, that they may grow in Knowledge, and in all mini&s;terial Ac|compli&s;hments, that their profiting may appear to all, and in all things They &s;hould al&s;o be diligent to know the State of their Flocks, that they may be able to give to every one their Portion in due Sea&s;on: And &s;hould be laying hold of every Opportunity of doing Good to them, by in&s;tructing them, by inculcating
<PB N="34" REF="004111_0036_1003D3EC3A703098">
their Duty upon them, by warning, coun&s;elling and comforting of them, as there is Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In a Word, There mu&s;t be <HI>Line upon Line, Line upon Line; Precept upon Precept, Precept upon Precept; here a little, and there a little,</HI> dropping continually from Mini&s;ters for the Good of Souls. And &s;o, in &s;hort, their main Study mu&s;t be how to win Souls, This mu&s;t take up their Thoughts when at home, or when they are abroad, when they ri&s;e up and when they lay down, when they are riding or wal|king by the Way; for as this is the Bu&s;ine&s;s they are devoted unto, &s;o, if they be wi&s;e they will make a Bu&s;ine&s;s of it, and give them&s;elves <HI>wholly</HI> to the&s;e Things, and willingly &s;pend and be &s;pent in this im|portant Service.</P>
<P N="5">5 thly, Another In&s;tance of Wi&s;dom in winning Souls is to be <HI>very prayerful.</HI></P>
<P>For, con&s;idering there is &s;o much Skill and Wi&s;dom nece&s;&s;ary to win Souls, and that this cometh forth from the Lord of Ho&s;ts that is <HI>wonderful in Coun&s;el;</HI> and con&s;idering further, that after all our Wi&s;dom, it is GOD who by his Spirit and Grace wins the Soul over to Chri&s;t; any Mini&s;ter that is wi&s;e will &s;ee that he has &s;uch a Dependance upon GOD, both for A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Succe&s;s in his Mini&s;try, that he wont pretend to go on in it, without earne&s;t &s;eeking to GOD for Help and Grace to he vouch&s;a&s;ed unto him, unto tho&s;e that hear him.</P>
<P>When a Mini&s;ter &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;iders the arduous and important Bu&s;ine&s;s that he is engaging in, he will be ready to cry with the Apo&s;tle, 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 216 <HI>And who is &s;ufficent for the&s;e Things?</HI> and will hum|bly and earne&s;tly cry unto GOD for Wi&s;dom and Grace that may be &s;ufficient for him. He will take Encouragement from tho&s;e gracious Words, Jam. 1.5. <HI>If any of you lack</HI> WISDOM, <HI>let him ask of GOD, who
<PB N="35" REF="004111_0037_1003D3FB247FE328">
giveth to all Men liberally and upbraideth not, and it &s;hall be given him;</HI> and will accordingly cry after Wi&s;dom, and lift up his Voice for Under&s;tanding, that he may know how to go in and out before the People he is &s;et over in the Lord; how to manage their various Tempers, and deal with their Souls &s;o as to win and &s;ave them. He will pray for Direc|tion and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in his Studies, and in every Ser|mon that he compo&s;es, that he may be led into Truth, that he may be kept from Errors, and that &s;uch things may be dictated to his Mind as &s;hall be &s;ea&s;onable and profitable to the Souls of tho&s;e that hear him, and to his own Soul; and that he may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted and directed in all his Admini&s;trations.</P>
<P>But then, being &s;en&s;ible al&s;o that his Learning, his Wi&s;dom, and Skill, will &s;ignify nothing, without the &s;etting in of divine Grace upon the Souls of Men, this is what he will be much in Prayer to God for, that the divine Spirit may go forth with all the Means that he is u&s;ing for the winning Souls; acknowledging with the Apo&s;tle, 1 Cor. 3.7. <HI>That neither is he that planteth any thing, neither be that watereth, but God that giveth the Increa&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>So that Mini&s;ters if they would be wi&s;e mu&s;t be Men of <HI>Prayer.</HI> And as the high Prie&s;t of old was to bear the Names of the Children of I&s;rael upon his Heart in the Brea&s;t Plate of Judgment, when he went into the holy Place before the Lord, (<HI>Exod.</HI> 28. 29.) &s;o Mini&s;ters &s;hould bear their People upon their Hearts when they appear before God in Prayers, and &s;hould be far from thinking it lo&s;t time that is &s;pent, in &s;pread|ing the Ca&s;es of their People before GOD, commend|ing them to his Mercy and Grace. GOD is my Wit|ne&s;s (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) whom I &s;erve with my Spirit in the Go&s;pel of his Son, <HI>that without</HI> CEASING <HI>I make Mention of you</HI> ALWAYS <HI>in my</HI> PRAYERS, Rom. 1.9.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="004111_0038_1003D4060CB96A70">But it is high Time that I proceed to the APPLI|CATION AND IMPROVEMENT of the&s;e Things. And here, although the foregoing Heads would afford us many u&s;eful Inferences, yet I &s;hall only hint at a few which the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion calls for.</P>
<P N="1">I. Is it the &s;pecial Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mini&s;ters to win Souls; How &s;hould this <HI>recommend the Office, and tho&s;e who are faithful in it, to the E&s;teem, Honour, and Love of the People?</HI></P>
<P>What Office is there more glorious and more en|dearing than this of winning Souls? This was the great Errand Chri&s;t came into the World upon, even to &s;eek and &s;ave lo&s;t Souls. And as the Thought of this &s;hould endear Chri&s;t unto us, &s;o &s;hould it Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, who (under him) come upon the &s;ame De&s;ign. What more high, noble, and generous Im|ployment, than to &s;how Men the Way to Salvation, and per&s;wade Men into it? And how welcome &s;hould &s;uch be to a People, that come to &s;ave their Souls from Death, to gain them over to Chri&s;t to Heaven and Happine&s;s? Is not the Soul exceeding precious, of more Worth than all the World? And is it not of infinitely greater Importance to every Man to &s;ave his Soul than gain the World? How thankful then &s;hould we be, that Chri&s;t has appointed an Or|der of Men for this very Purpo&s;e; and how &s;hould every one, that is faithful in this Office, be welcome to our very Souls? And how in&s;en&s;ible are they of the preciou&s;ne&s;s of their own Souls, and of their lo&s;t and peri&s;hing State, who undervalue the Mi|ni&s;try as a needle&s;s Office, and de&s;pi&s;e Mini&s;ters?</P>
<P>Indeed as for &s;uch as di&s;parage their Office by their unskilfulne&s;s, unfaithfulne&s;s, and corrupt Prac|tices; I have nothing to &s;ay for them. But I would &s;ay, it is Pity the Mini&s;try in general &s;hould be blamed, &s;hould be undervalued, upon the Account of &s;uch.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="004111_0039_1003D40FDD525CE8">And tho&s;e holy Souls who have been won thro' the Mini&s;try of the Word, will honour and love tho&s;e that have been the In&s;truments of their Conver&s;ion; yea, and every faithful Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, &s;aying as in Rom. 10. 15. <HI>How beautiful are the Feet of them that preach the Go&s;pel of Peace, and bring glad Tidings of good Things?</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Is there a great deal of Wi&s;dom requi&s;ite to the winning Souls? Hence <HI>this Bu&s;ine&s;s ought to be com|mitted only to wi&s;e Men.</HI></P>
<P>For, to what Purpo&s;e will it be to commit the Care of Souls to &s;uch as are unskilfull in the Word of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or that would be unfaithful in the Work? The&s;e would di&s;parage the Office, fru&s;trate the De&s;ign of their holy Calling, and &s;o would deceive and de&s;troy, rather than gain and &s;ave Men's Souls.</P>
<P>And &s;urely, Con&s;idering the Importance of the Bu|&s;in&s;s, that it relates to Men's Souls, the future and eternal Salvation of them, it mu&s;t needs be highly incumbent upon all that are concerned in chu&s;ing and putting Men into the Mini&s;try, to act with the grea|te&s;t Care.</P>
<P>Here let me &s;ay, a People &s;hould be very careful in the Choice of one to whom they commit the Care of their Souls, and of the Souls of their Chil|dren. They &s;hould not proceed &s;uddenly in &s;uch a weighty Affair; &s;hould get the be&s;t Advice they can, and &s;hould be well &s;atisfied of a Man's Wi&s;dom and Skill in the Art of winning Souls, before they make Choice of him. This Art of winning Souls is the grand mini&s;terial Gift, and &s;hould be <HI>earne&s;tly cove|ted</HI> by a People.</P>
<P>And then, As to tho&s;e who have the Power of in|troducing and inve&s;ting any with that &s;acred Office, they ought not <HI>to lay Hands &s;uddenly on any Man,</HI> but &s;hould be well &s;atisfied of his having a good Fa|culty

at winning Souls; that he be well furni&s;hed with Knowledge to direct and guide Men to Chri&s;t, and with Arguments to per&s;wade, and be able to u&s;e them in &s;uch a Manner as would convince the Judgment, and move the Pa&s;&s;ions, conveying (like the Sun) Light and Heat at the &s;ame Time; and that he be di&s;po&s;ed to lay him&s;elf out, and employ all his Skill for this grand De&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle's Charge to <HI>Timothy,</HI> was to commit this Work to <HI>faithful</HI> Men, that &s;houd be <HI>able</HI> to teach others, 2 Tim. 2.2. And who tho&s;e faithful Men are, and the particular Qualifications nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e that are to be brought into the mini&s;terial Office, we have laid down by the &s;ame Apo&s;tle as a Directory to his Son <HI>Timothy, 1&s;t</HI> Epi&s;tle <HI>3d</HI> Chapter at the Beginning.</P>
<P N="3">III. We learn what is the peculiar Accompli&s;hment tho&s;e &s;hould be &s;eeking after, that are devoted to the Work of the Mini&s;try, namely, <HI>the Art of winning Souls.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Art that every Candidate for the Mi|ni&s;try &s;hould be learning, and that every Mini&s;ter &s;hould be perfecting him&s;elf in continually.</P>
<P>We &s;hould learn the Art of explaining Doc|trines and Duties, and of urging Faith and Prac|tice, with the mo&s;t moving Arguments. We mu&s;t get acquainted with the Structure of humane Na|ture, and with the &s;everal Ways of working upon the various Powers and Faculties of our Con&s;titution. We mu&s;t learn how to inlighten and convince the Under&s;tanding and Judgment, how to per&s;wade the Will, and &s;trike the Pa&s;&s;ions, yea, and the Sen&s;es too. We mu&s;t learn to know Men, and what kind of Addre&s;s will be&s;t &s;uit them, and &s;o mu&s;t know how to accommodate our&s;elves, and all our In&s;tructions and Exhortations, to the &s;everal Tempers and Ca|pacities of Men. And la&s;tly, We mu&s;t learn the Art of
<PB N="39" REF="004111_0041_1003D41DA32B18F8">
living well our&s;elves; whereby we &s;hall repre&s;ent Religion in the mo&s;t amiable Light, and recommend it mo&s;t effectually to others.</P>
<P>And now, DEAR SIR,</P>
<P>Since this is the very Bu&s;ine&s;s you are entring upon and engaging in, even to WIN SOULS to Chri&s;t, and &s;ave them from Death, and &s;ince this is the Time for your <HI>publick and &s;olemn Introduction into this &s;acred Office, by Prayer, and the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery,</HI> I mu&s;t &s;ay a few things to you.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t of all, I hope that you your&s;elf are won and gained over to Chri&s;t. For with what Face, or with what Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, can any undertake to per&s;wade others over to Chri&s;t and to his Go&s;pel, with &s;uch Arguments as he him&s;elf has never felt the Force of?</P>
<P>I tru&s;t you are per&s;waded of the Truth, and convinced of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of, and actually in love with, that Religion which you are to recommend to the Faith, the Love, and Practice of others; and that you can &s;et forth the Excellencies of it from your own happy Experience: and with what Advan|tages will you urge &amp; per&s;wade this People to be reli|gious, if you can let them know from your own Ex|perience, that the <HI>Ways of Religion are Ways of Plea|&s;antne&s;s, and all her Paths Peace.</HI></P>
<P>You are about to have a great Tru&s;t committed to you; even that which is more valuable than any Thing in this lower World. <HI>Not the E&s;tates of Men:</HI> for as our Ma&s;ter did not, much le&s;s &s;hould his Mini|&s;ters, undertake to be Judges, and Dividers among the People: And therefore the le&s;s you meddle with the&s;e Things the better. Nor are the Bodies of Men to be committed to your Care: they mu&s;t when di&s;|ea&s;ed be left to the Phy&s;ician, under GOD the great Phy&s;ician of all. But they are the Souls of Men, precious Souls, immortal Souls, one of which is worth
<PB N="40" REF="004111_0042_1003D425DD3E1968">
a World, that is to be committed to your Charge: And you are to watch for them as one that mu&s;t give an Account. They are to be committed to you as a Worker together with GOD, to win them over to Chri&s;t, to deliver them out of their lo&s;t and peri&s;hing State, and per&s;wade them to be happy. A glorious Work indeed! What an high and honourable Call|ing is this, to have to do with Men's Souls, and be the In&s;trument of their Salvation? The Angels think it their Honour to <HI>Mini&s;ter unto them who &s;hall be Heirs of Salvation,</HI> Heb. 1.14. In what an humble and adoring Manner &s;hould you then &s;ay to GOD, <HI>who am I, and what is my Fathers Hou&s;e that thou ha&s;t brought me hither unto?</HI> 2 Sam. 7.18.</P>
<P>But then, Con&s;ider the Difficulty as well as Dig|nity of the Office; it is to win Souls, corrupt and wicked Souls, from their corrupt and &s;inful State, and from all the corrupt Practices they have been accu&s;tomed unto: and what more difficult than to change Men's Natures, and turn them from their evil Cu&s;toms? Moreover; You may depend upon having the Devil with all his cur&s;ed Legions, corrupt Nature with all its wicked and unrea&s;onable Lu&s;ts, the Men of the World with all their enticing Arts, the Things of the World and all the corrupt Cu&s;toms and Practices of it oppo&s;ing you, with all their Subtilty and Power. And how do you think you &s;hall be able to re&s;cue poor Souls out of the Hands of &s;o many &s;ubtle and powerful Adver&s;aries as the&s;e? Surely the Thought of this might well di&s;|courage you from the Undertaking, were it not for the A&s;&s;urance that HE, who is with you, is &s;tronger than all tho&s;e that be again&s;t you. But oh! the Knowledge, the Skill, the Wi&s;dom you will need continually to manage with Succe&s;s in the Affair! This Art of winning Souls is the mo&s;t difficult to be learnt
<PB N="41" REF="004111_0043_1003D436972DBB28">
of any, it requires more Under&s;tanding, and Prudence, and Patience, and Meekne&s;s, and Humility, and Self-denial to manage it to good, Purpo&s;e, than any other Calling. You mu&s;t therefore be repairing continually to the Fountain <HI>and Father of Lights;</HI> from whom every good Gift and every perfect Gift de&s;cends. And altho' we tru&s;t you are in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure qualified herefor; yet let me tell you, it is an Art that you may be growing in as long as you live; and as in other &s;o in this divine Art, <HI>Ob|&s;ervation &amp; Experience</HI> will give you great Advantage.</P>
<P>Wherefore now &s;et your&s;elf to the Bu&s;ine&s;s with all your Might, that you may grow more and more perfect in this excellent Art, and may be in&s;trumen|tal in winning and &s;aving tho&s;e Souls in your Flock that you &s;ee are peri&s;hing. And, that you may di&s;|charge your Office faithfully, and in the mo&s;t likely Manner to be &s;ucce&s;sful, let me leave two or three Words of Coun&s;el with you.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>Always di&s;tingui&s;h between winning, over to</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and to a particular</HI> PARTY. Don't think that the bringing Men over to a particular Opinion, as to &s;ome doctrinal or di&s;ciplinary Points; or to a particular Side in a Controver&s;y, and a Quarrel, is the winning them over to Chri&s;t: for Men's being on the wrong or the right Side in controver&s;ial Points, don't determine which Side they are on, with re&s;pect to Chri&s;t and the Salvation of their Souls.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. U&s;e no other Arts in per&s;wading over to Chri&s;t than tho&s;e that <HI>the Go&s;pel will bear you out in, which are fair and hone&s;t, ju&s;t and true. Don't &s;peak wickedly for GOD, nor talk deceitfully for him,</HI> Job. 13.7. Take Pattern by the Apo&s;tles, who &s;ay, <HI>We are not as many who corrupt the Word, or deal deceit|fully with the Word, but as of Sincerity, but as of GOD,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cor. 2.17. <HI>Seeing we have received this Mini&s;try as
<PB N="42" REF="004111_0044_1003D44663B83DC8">
we have obtained Mercy we faint not, but have re|nounced the hidden Things of Di&s;hone&s;ty, not walking in Craftine&s;s, not handling the Word of GOD deceitfully, but by Manife&s;tation of the Truth, commending our&s;elves to every Man's Con&s;cience, in the Sight of GOD,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.2. You may not u&s;e any flattering Di&s;&s;imulations or Deceits, to win Men over to Chri&s;t: This would be to <HI>Steal</HI> Men's Hearts (as <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> did the Hearts of the Men of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>) rather than fairly win them. The Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t requires no di&s;&s;embling about it, and Hone&s;ty will always be found to be the be&s;t Po|licy. Indeed it is frequently mentioned as an Ar|gument to ju&s;tify &s;ome kind of Guile and Deceit in winning and per&s;wading Men to Chri&s;t, that the A|po&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays of the <HI>Corinthians, That he being crafty caught them with Guile,</HI> 2 Cor. 12.16. But they mi&s;take the Apo&s;tle, for he therein only tells them what evil Surmi&s;es and Sugge&s;tions there were among them concerning him, and that it was their Sugge&s;tion among them&s;elves that he had caught them with Guile; that is they in&s;inuate, that altho' he did not Burden them by calling for any Money from them, yet, that he was crafty, and &s;et others to take Money of them for his U&s;e; but this he ut|terly denies in the two following Ver&s;es. So that this Text don't give the lea&s;t Countenance to the u&s;ing any Guile or Deceit in winning Souls; for the Apo&s;tle denies that ever he did &s;o, and mentions it only as a bare Surmi&s;e of others.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, and la&s;tly. <HI>See that you have an impartial Re|gard to the Souls of all committed to your Charge.</HI> Don't let any Soul &s;uffer thro' Cowardice or Contempt. Don't neglect the Souls of the Rich and Great thro' fear of offending; but remember that if they loo&s;e their Souls, their worldly Riches will by no Means an&s;wer in Exchange for them: therefore in a friendly
<PB N="43" REF="004111_0045_1003D44EA49FC350">
faithful Manner, endeavour that they may not have all their good Things in this Life. And don't let the Poor be de&s;pi&s;ed and &s;ink below your particular Watch and Care; but remember that their Souls are equally precious with the Souls of others, and endea|vour that tho&s;e who are poor in this Word may be rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>And now, What &s;hall I &s;ay unto you, to put you upon the utmo&s;t Faithfulne&s;s and Diligence in this Bu&s;ine&s;s? You know the Worth of Souls, you know the ine&s;timable Price that has been paid for their Ran&s;om, and that &s;uch corruptible Things as Silver and Gold could not redeem them. You know al&s;o that if they peri&s;h thro' your Neglect, their Blood will be required at your Hand: Whereas if you are but the Means of winning, converting, and &s;aving them, what a Joy and Crown of Rejoycing would they be to you? What a Comfort will they be to you in this World? For if you win their Souls over to Chri&s;t, you will gain a great Share of their Af|fections to your&s;elf; &s;o that you need not to be con|cerned to &s;ecure the Affections and Kindne&s;&s;es of your People, any other Way than by winning them o|ver to Chri&s;t; for &s;uch will think nothing too much to do, according to their Ability, for the honourable and comfortable Support of him that GOD has made the In&s;trument hereof.</P>
<P>But then, What a Glory will &s;uch Souls be to you hereafter? How will they love and thank you, and how will they prai&s;e GOD and Chri&s;t for you, throughout Eternity? Verily, Every &s;uch Soul &s;hall be like &s;o many Pearls and precious Diamonds, &s;et in that unfading Crown of Glory, which you &s;hall receive when the chief Shepherd &s;hall appear: <HI>For they that be Wi&s;e &s;hall &s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s as the Stars forever and ever,</HI> Dan. 12.3.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="004111_0046_1003D45B00C0CF60">I &s;hall conclude with a brief Addre&s;s to the <HI>Church and Congregation,</HI> at who&s;e De&s;ire, and upon who&s;e Account, we are met together at this Time. You have been &s;eeking and praying to the GOD of the Spirits of all Fle&s;h, to &s;et a Man over the Congrega|tion, that may go in before you, and go out before you in &s;piritual Things. And now <HI>behold the</HI> MAN; The <HI>Man</HI> whom, we tru&s;t, the Lord hath cho&s;en for you. He is coming among you (we tru&s;t) not to &s;eek yours but you; not to get your worldly Riches, but to gain your precious Souls.

<P>Surely, Since he comes to &s;eek and win your Souls, you ought to open them unto him, and let him into them, that is, into the Affections of them; yea, and into the Circum&s;tances of them, &s;o far as is nece&s;&s;ary for his working and winning upon them.</P>
<P>I charitably hope that many of you, according to your Profe&s;&s;ion, are already won over to Chri&s;t; and then his Bu&s;ine&s;s, as to you, will be to &s;trengthen your Faith, your Love, and Obedience to Chri&s;t, and cau&s;e you to grow in Grace, and to abound more and more in the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; even to build them up in Faith, Holine&s;&s;, and Comfort unto Salvation.</P>
<P>And as for tho&s;e of you that are yet in your Sins, and have not as yet been per&s;waded over to Chri&s;t, &s;ee that you be won by his Coun&s;els &amp; his good Conver&s;a|tion in Chri&s;t.

don't let him have any Rea&s;on to complain that he labours in vain, and &s;pends his Strength for nought; take heed of every thing that &s;hall grieve him, or that &s;hall di&s;courage him in his Work.</P>
<P>He is <HI>young and tender,</HI> and ye had need do all ye can to &s;trengthen his Hands and encourage his Heart, by living in Love, and Peace with him, and one with another. Beware of Di&s;cord among your &s;elves, or with your Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Let the &s;ore Contentions that have been of late among you, and which have rent you to pieces, be a perpetual Warning to you, to guard again&s;t the beginning of Strife, and to leave off Contention be|fore it be meddled with.</P>
<P>And here let me &s;ay, That altho' your Contenti|ons have been &s;o &s;harp as to put you and your Bre|thren a&s;under, yet ye mu&s;t by no Means loo&s;e all your Charity and Affection for them. You mu&s;t exerci&s;e a forgiving Spirit towards them, as you hope that they would exerci&s;e the &s;ame towards you, and as you hope that GOD will forgive you. For tho&s;e Divi&s;ions there had need be great &s;earchings of Heart on all Sides, and every one ought to be jealous and fearful lea&s;t he has done ami&s;s in tho&s;e Days and Years of Temptation.</P>

<HEAD>The Right Hand of FELLOWSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>_AS the thru&s;ting forth Labourers into His Har|ve&s;t, is to be a&s;cribed to the Care, Grace, and Faithfulne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;o|vereign Head of the Church; &s;o there is a wonderful Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s and Conde|&s;cention di&s;covered in the Order and Manner wherein this is done by Him: He having ve&s;ted his Churches with a gracious Liberty of chu&s;ing, from among&s;t tho&s;e, whom the Head of Influences, has rai&s;ed up, qualified, and di&s;po&s;ed to that &s;acred Employment, &s;uch, as upon their &s;incere and ardent Addre&s;&s;es to Him for Direction, and the Exerci&s;e of their own be&s;t Judgment and Di&s;cretion, they &s;hall think mo&s;t likely to promote the great Ends of GOD's Glory, and the Good of precious Souls, in the mid&s;t of them.</P>
<P>That the Churches of Chri&s;t are by Him ve&s;ted with this Liberty, and indulg'd this Privilege, is evident from their U&s;age in the primitive Times of Chri&s;tianity; and may be fairly argued even from the &s;acred Scriptures them&s;elves: and particularly from <HI>Acts</HI> 14. 23. which Text rendered in our Tran&s;lation, <HI>And when they had ordained them Elders in every City,</HI> is rendered by Rev <HI>Beza, Quum&abque; ip&s;is per &s;uffragia cr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ent per &s;ingulas Eccle&s;ias Presbyteros</HI> i. e. When they had by the Su&s;&s;tages or Votes of the People created them Elders in every Church. And that this Tran&s;|lation is ju&s;t, has been allow'd and pleaded by many, the be&s;t Expo&s;itors, who have under&s;tood and well con&s;idered the Import of the Word <GAP DESC="foreign">, u&s;ed in the Text.</P>
<P>And however this Priviledge or Liberty of electing their own Pa&s;tors, has on occa&s;ion of the Abu&s;e of it by the Churches them&s;elves, or the a&s;&s;uming Di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e who have had the A&s;cendency over them, or both, been ta|ken away from many of the Churches of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the taking away whereof is, by Rev. <HI>Calvin,</HI> &s;tiled

<P>It is too notorious to be di&s;&s;embled that in the Elections of Pa&s;tors in &s;ome of our Churches and Congregations, there has been a lamentable Loo&s;e given to Men's Hu|mours, Lu&s;ts, and Pa&s;&s;ions; than which there can &s;carce be named a more awful Evidence of the Decay of vital Piety, or a more pregnant Symptom of the Withdrawings of the gracious Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t from His People. Yet, never|thele&s;s (and to GOD's Prai&s;e be it &s;poken!) we have had from time to time many In&s;tances, wherein, making the nece&s;&s;ary Abatements for humane Frailty, this Tran&s;action has been proceeded to and managed in our Churches, with a Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Order, agreable to the Importance of the Matter, and becoming a People &s;o much indulg'd and highly favoured of the Lord</P>
<P>And it is Matter of Rejoycing to us, that we have beheld &s;o much of the Fruits of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, in that Order, Peace, and Unanimity, with which you, our honoured and dear Brethren in Chri&s;t, have proceeded in your Choice of the worthy Per&s;on now &s;et over you in the Lord</P>
<P>And having &s;een you now renewedly &s;ignify your De|&s;ires of him for your Pa&s;tor, and heard him, with an expre&s;s Dependence upon Chri&s;t the glorious Head of Influences, complying with your De&s;ires herein, and devoting him&s;elf to the evangelical Mini&s;try; yea further, having &s;een him in a &s;olemn Manner &s;eperated or ordained to the pa&s;toral Office, by Prayer and laying on of the Hands of the Pres|bytery. &mdash; There can remain no imaginable Ground, whereupon to withhold from him, tho&s;e Acknowledgments, Wi&s;hes Hopes and Promi&s;es, which have been wont to be expre&s;s'd by the Elder&s;hip, unto &s;uch as from time to time it hath plea&s;ed our a&s;cended Lord to add unto their Number.</P>
<P>Which therefore, being thereto deputed, (tho' unworthy of a &s;tanding among&s;t them) I &s;hall now, in the Name of the Elder&s;hip, expre&s;s, by giving you, Reverend and Dear SIR, <HI>The Right Hand of our Fellow&s;hip;</HI> hereby te&s;tifying

<P>We would al&s;o hereby be under&s;tood to expre&s;s our Sa|tisfaction in your call to the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, and to own and a&s;&s;ert the Validity and Fulne&s;s of your Ordination to that &s;acred Office.

<P>A&s;&s;uring you, That, as GOD &s;hall enable and need re|quire, we &s;hall readily give you the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of our Prayers and Advice from time to time, and &s;hall always re|joyce to &s;ee the Work of the Lord pro&s;pering in your Hands.</P>
<P>And now, Reverend and Dear Brother, &s;uffer me to ob|&s;erve to you, That we take your thus receiving the Right Hand of our Fellow&s;hip, as expre&s;&s;ive on your Part of the &s;ame Acknowledgments, Wi&s;hes, Hopes and Promi&s;es, to|wards us. And may it plea&s;e GOD to help you and us, to bear in Mind the&s;e mutual and endearing Engagements, for the &s;trengthening our holy Fellow&s;hip, and not &s;uffer them to pa&s;s away as Words of Cour&s;e or an empty Formality.</P>
<P>Verily, SIR, from our own Experience we can a&s;&s;ure you, the Work you are engaged in is a laborious &amp; difficult Work: A Work wherein you mu&s;t expect to meet with great Oppo&s;ition: A Work therefore in order to the due Di&s;charge whereof you mu&s;t arm your&s;elf with Patience and Re&s;olution, always relying upon Chri&s;t, in whom all ful|ne&s;s dwells, and remembring that you watch for Men's Souls as one that mu&s;t give an Account.</P>
<P>And may it plea&s;e our glorious Redeemer, always to af|ford his promi&s;ed Pre&s;ence with you, and to cau&s;e his Grace to be &s;ufficient for you! May you be wi&s;e to win Souls, and in&s;trumental of turning many unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s, who may be your Hope, your Joy and Crown of Rejoycing, in the Pre&s;ence of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t at His Coming.</P>
