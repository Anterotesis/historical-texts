<HEAD>OF FAITH.</HEAD>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>WHAT is Faith?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> It is a work of God's Almighty Quickning Power, wrought by the Mini&s;try of the Word and Spirit of God, whereby the Heart is weaned from all Confidence in the Fle&s;h, and believeth in God and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Whether doth Faith or Repentance go before, in the Work of Conver&s;ion?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> You may di&s;cern in the Coun&s;el <HI>Peter</HI> gives, and works upon tho&s;e, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38. <HI>Peter</HI> calls them to Repentance. Is that the fir&s;t work? It is the fir&s;t, after they were pricked in heart; but that they were pricked in heart, doth pre&s;uppo&s;e that they did believe, that it was Je&s;us whom they had Crucified, &amp; &s;o <HI>Zach.</HI> 12.10. they &s;aw it was Chri&s;t whom they had thus abu&s;ed, and mourned for him, and it was not a meer legal mourning, for then they would not have come to the Apo&s;tle to know what to do, there is &s;o much Faith as to &s;ee their own Wickedne&s;s again&s;t Chri&s;t, and which is more, here is an act of Reverence, <HI>Men and Brethren;</HI> their &s;coffing &s;pirits are made low, to come to him,
<PB N="4" REF="001604_0003_0FB3E5ACF7F63F88">
that wounds them: which is an act of Faith. There is a threefold act of Faith, and &s;o a threefold act of Repentance; fir&s;t which is an a&s;&s;ent by which a man knows the Will of God, and a&s;&s;ents to it, this is the Will of God, but I have walked contrary to it, and this now pierceth the heart, and &s;o is hum|bled, which is an act of Repentance; but then there is another act of Faith, and that is adhea|rence, cleaving to God, and from thence &s;prings a|nother work of Repentance, to turn to him in humble Confe&s;&s;ion, in humble Supplication, in ear|ne&s;t de&s;ires after Grace and Covenant: After this there &s;prings another act of Faith, God Revealing his Covenant; then &s;prings another act of Repen|tance, that we &s;hould Sin again&s;t &s;o good a God, and thereupon turns with all his heart to God, and labours to turn others? <HI>Come and &s;ee what God hath done for my Soul.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>John Cotton,</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> his twelve Fundamental Articles of Chri&s;tian Religi|on? The denial whereof after once or twice Admo|nition <HI>[he conceives]</HI> makes a man an Heretick.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE fir&s;t is touching the Per&s;ons in the Tri|nity; that there be Three Per&s;ons, Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t; and all but One God, this is a known Principle of our Chri&s;tian Faith, and held forth in every Creed: and that it is of the Foundation, appears by this, 1 Joh. 2 23. <HI>Who&s;oever denieth the Son, the &s;ame hath not the Father;</HI> therefore when a man upon pretence there is but one God, will have no more Per&s;ons but One, and the Son he will not have to be as he is, God, this
<PB N="5" REF="001604_0004_0FB3E5AE80BFF4A0">
man overthroweth the Foundation of Chri&s;tian Religion, as <HI>Arius</HI> did, and others after him; the Holy Gho&s;t is joyned together with the re&s;t in our Bapti&s;m; <HI>I Bapti&s;e thee into the Name of the Fa|ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> this is a Profe&s;&s;ion of part of our Chri&s;tianity, and a great part of it too, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.19, 20.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is another Article, and Fundamental Arti|cle of Chri&s;tian Religion, that the Lord hath Made, and doth Govern all the World, and is a Rewarder of Good and Evil. That he is a Re|warder with Ble&s;&s;ing of that which is Good, and taketh Vengeance on every one that doth Evil, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.6. <HI>He that comes to God, mu&s;t believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that dili|gently &s;eek him.</HI> Gen. 1.1. He mu&s;t know this, he that comes to God mu&s;t believe this, if he believe not this, there is no hope of Salvation for &s;uch an one, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.3. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.11. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.6.10.</P>
<P N="3">3. This is another Fundamental Article of our Chri&s;tian Faith? That this God alone is to be Wor&s;hipped, with Religious Wor&s;hip, <HI>Mat.</HI> 4.10. <HI>Thou &s;halt Wor&s;hip the Lord thy God, and him only &s;halt thou &s;erve:</HI> If a man Wor&s;hip any other God, be&s;ides the Lord, or if a man Wor&s;hip any other God, the Lord will cut off them that Swear by the Lord, and that Swear by <HI>Malcham.</HI> If a man Wor&s;hip Angels, he holds not the Head: <HI>Get thee behind me Satan</HI> in &s;uch a Ca&s;e. <HI>Avante.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. This is the Fourth. That this Wor&s;hip of God is to be offered to him according to his Writ|ten Word. I &s;ay, this Wor&s;hip that is acceptable to him, is written in his Word; if any man &s;hall wor&s;hip God by the Precepts of men, it is not ac|according to the Will of God: <HI>To the Law and to

the Te&s;timony? If any man &s;peak not according to this word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.16, 17. the whole Scripture (the written Word of God, is of Divine In&s;piration, <HI>and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof,</HI> &amp;c. The Scripture is a perfect Rule of Faith and Manners, that is a Foun|dation of Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P N="5">5. A Fifth Article is, That for our own part, we have not &s;o Wor&s;hipped God, from the Fall of our Fir&s;t Parents. We and our Fathers before us, we have all Sinned, and were Born in Sin from our Mothers Womb. <HI>If any man &s;ay, he hath no Sin</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>there is no truth in him.</HI> We have not kept the Ordinances and Statutes of the Lord, and &s;o have deceived our &s;elves of that Re|ward which the Lord hath promi&s;ed to them that diligently &s;eek him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.10, 11, 23 And in&s;tead of being under a Reward of Ble&s;&s;ing, we are un|der the Cur&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Sixth Article which a man mu&s;t know; or he cannot be &s;aved, (and if he hold again&s;t it, and know what he holds, it is impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be any true Grace in him) is, that we of our &s;elves are utterly unable to re&s;cue our &s;elves from this Mi&s;ery, by any &s;trength of our own; but we are utterly unable to help our &s;elves; It's that which the Prophet <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> &s;peaks to, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 13.9. <HI>O I&s;rael, thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed thy &s;elf, but in me is thy help</HI> And as we have fallen in our Fir&s;t Parents, &s;o in falling, we are only fit to fall: Where is then our help? It is in God. We were Born not of Blood, nor of the will of the Fle&s;h, nor of the will of Man, but of God; not of Blood, that is, our Conver&s;ion to God, comes not by the Blood of our Ance&s;tors&punc; Nor by the Will of the Fle&s;h,
<PB N="7" REF="001604_0006_0FB3E5B18A015EF0">
not the Will of Corrupt Nature; Nor by the Will of man, that is, of our mo&s;t holy Parents, or Mi|ni&s;ters, or other Good men.</P>
<P N="7">7. A Seventh Article is, That Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Son of the Eternal Father, in fulne&s;s of time took upon him our Nature, and became man, and hath Redeemed his Church (by his perfect Obedience to his Father) from Sin and Mi&s;ery: <HI>The Word that was from the Beginning was made fle&s;h, and we &s;aw his glory, as the glory of the only Begotten Son of the Father, full of grace and truth,</HI> Joh. 1.14. This is a Foundation of Chri&s;tian Religion. <HI>Every Spi|rit that confe&s;&s;eth not Je&s;us Chri&s;t come in the Fle&s;h, is not of God,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Chri&s;t hath Redeemed us from the Cur&s;e of the Law, being made a Cur&s;e for us,</HI> Gal 3.13.</P>
<P N="8">8. A Eighth Article is, This Salvation and Re|demption of Chri&s;t is freely given in the Go&s;pel, unto every Soul that believes in his Name; &amp; Faith is al&s;o freely given, that we may believe. I &s;ay, this Chri&s;t that works this Salvation and Redemp|tion, is given only to &s;uch as believe in his Name. <HI>For God &s;o loved the World,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. <HI>And if you believe not in me,</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>you have no life in you,</HI> no Salvation by me, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.24. <HI>If ye believe not that I am he, you &s;hall die in your Sins,</HI> and the Lord in giving you his Son, gives you Faith to believe in his Son, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.17. and both at the &s;ame in&s;tant, that if you have not Chri&s;t you have not Faith, and if you have not Faith, you have not Chri&s;t, Chri&s;t dwells in your heart by Faith; <HI>As many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe in his Name,</HI> Joh. 1.12. No man can come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that is, believe on him, except the Father draw him: No
<PB N="8" REF="001604_0007_0FB3E5B2F28C3F20">
man can come, there is an impo&s;&s;ibility of reaching him, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Lord put forth his Almighty Pow|er.</P>
<P N="9">9. Tho&s;e whom the Lord draws by his Word and Spirit to believe on Chri&s;t, them he Ju&s;ti|fies freely by his Grace in Chri&s;t: I &s;ay, tho&s;e whom the Lord draws to Chri&s;t by Faith, he ju&s;tifies freely by his rich Grace in Chri&s;t, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.23, 24. This is a Foundation of our Chri&s;tian Faith al&s;o. <HI>By the deeds of the Law, &s;hall no Fle&s;h be ju&s;tified in his &s;ight:</HI> So then Chri&s;t is God and man, he is come, and hath Redeemed us, this Redemption is given to the Faith of his People, this Faith is wrought by the Word and Spirit of God, it is the power of God to Sal|vation to them that believe. Where this Faith is, there is Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P N="10">10. Where the Soul is Ju&s;tified, it is al&s;o Re|generated. <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.3. <HI>For except ye be born a-new, ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. Except ye Repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h,</HI> Luk. 13.5.</P>
<P N="11">11. This Regeneration in us is imperfect, by rea&s;on we con&s;i&s;t partly of Fle&s;h, and partly of Spirit. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.9. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.17. Therefore gifts of Grace to be given, and Sins to be mortified, it is a fundamental point of Religion. Therefore the Apo&s;tle crieth out of his own Mi&s;ery, that he was not able to wre&s;tle again&s;t his own Corrup|tions.</P>
<P N="12">12. All men &s;hall Ri&s;e again at the La&s;t Day, both &s;uch as are Regenerated, and &s;uch as are not Regenerate; and both &s;hall be judged accor|ding to their works, the Righteous to Everla&s;t|ing Salvation, the Wicked to Everla&s;ting Dam|nation.
<PB N="9" REF="001604_0008_0FB3E5B475E23080">
So then put all the&s;e things together, and you have all the nece&s;&s;ary Points of Chri&s;tian Re|ligion; which who&s;o ob&s;tinately oppo&s;eth, or is ignorant of, he cannot be found in a State of Grace that Accompanies Salvation, this is the Summe of the Articles; and he that overthrows any one of the&s;e, and ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;teth therein, brings him&s;elf to Eternal Damnation.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>If any man ask, Why we &s;hould look at any Fundamental Articles of Chri&s;tian Religion, be&s;ides them that are in the Creed of the twelve Apo&s;tles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I an&s;wer, There be &s;ome things there that are not Fundamental Articles, and there are &s;ome Fundamental Articles that are left out; as that Chri&s;t de&s;cended into Hell, it is no Fundamental Article of Chri&s;tian Religion, though it be taken for his De&s;cending into the Grave; nor do I think this Creed was made by the Apo&s;tles, much le&s;s that Article; and there are other Fundamental Articles which are not there, as the Word to be a Rule of Faith and Manners; little al&s;o is &s;aid in the Creed of Ju&s;tification or Regeneration.</P>

<P>THat there is in all &s;uch that are Effectually Called and United unto Chri&s;t, In-dwelling Spiritual Gifts of Grace, wrought and created in us by the Holy Gho&s;t, that is, by the begetting whereof, we are begotten and renewed to a Spi|ritual Life unto God.</P>

<HEAD>The Opening of the Terms of this Doctrine.</HEAD>
<P>By Gifts and Grace, I mean Holy Qualities, the &s;ame which Philo&s;ophers call Vertues, Habits, or good Di&s;po&s;itions, whereby the faculties and af|fections of the Soul, which by Corrupt Nature are &s;et upon a mans &s;elf and Earthly Things, and can|not &s;avour the things of God (and &s;o are &s;aid to be dead) are hereby &s;anctified and lifted up to God, and &s;et upon him, and Heavenly Things; and &s;o are &s;aid to be <HI>quickned and made alive unto God;</HI> whence we are &s;aid to be <HI>begotten a|gain to a lively hope,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.3.

The&s;e Gifts (we &s;ay) are wrought or created by the Holy Gho&s;t, be|cau&s;e they are the fruits or the effects of the Spirit of God in us. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.22, 23. <HI>Wrought by his Almighty Creating Power</HI> (out of nothing) Col. 2.12. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.10. and thereby making us <HI>Spiritual men,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.15. <HI>Living Stones,</HI> and fit in&s;truments for Gods <HI>Spiritual Service,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.5. and therefore every one of tho&s;e gifts and graces whereby any faculty or affection of the Soul is &s;anctified; it is called the Spirit of &s;uch a faculty or affection, as the &s;anctified di&s;po&s;iti|on of the mind, is called the Spirit of a <HI>Sound Mind,</HI> 2 Tim. 1.7.

<P>The fir&s;t Rea&s;on is taken from the expre&s;s te&s;ti|mony of Scripture, &s;peaking of the gifts of the Ho|ly Gho&s;t, as being in us, and fruitful in us. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.5, 6, 7, 7, 8. <HI>add moreover</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>to your faith vertue, and to your vertue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, &amp; to patience godline&s;s, and to godline&s;s brotherly kind|ne&s;s, and to brotherly kindne&s;s love; for if the&s;e things be in you and abound, they make you, that you &s;hall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> from whence the rea&s;on is concluded thus, faith, vertue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godline&s;s, brotherly kind|ne&s;s, love, they are all in us, and makes us fruitful in Chri&s;t.

neither the Holy Gho&s;t him&s;elf (for then one Ho|ly Gho&s;t &s;hould be added to another) or one part of the Holy Gho&s;t &s;hould be added to another) nor are the actions of the Holy Gho&s;t proceeding from us; for the&s;e things are in us, and abounding in us, and con&s;equently abiding in us, and they cau&s;e us to bring forth actions meet for Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, for they are &s;aid to make us <HI>fruitful in the knowledge of Chri&s;t,</HI> ver. 8.

<HEAD>Rea&s;on II.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;econd Rea&s;on is taken from &s;uch places of Scripture, as put an expre&s;s difference between the Holy Gho&s;t, and his gifts in us, and the exerci&s;e of the&s;e gifts by us. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6.14. <HI>Stir up &s;aith</HI> Paul <HI>to</HI> Timothy <HI>the gift of God which is in thee and us,</HI> ver. 14. <HI>that good trea&s;ure</HI> (or thing) <HI>which was com|mitted to thee, keep by the Holy Gho&s;t which dwelleth in us;</HI> where there is a plain difference, between the gift of God, and the &s;tirring up of the gift, which is the exerci&s;e of it; and the Holy Gho&s;t which helpeth him to keep it, and to u&s;e it.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>But he &s;peaketh of Mini&s;terial Gifts, not of Gifts accompanying Salvation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He &s;peaketh of both, for in the ver&s;e next before (ver. 5.) he putteth <HI>Timothy</HI> in mind of the <HI>unfeigned faith which</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>is in thee, &amp; which dwelt fir&s;t in thy Grandmother</HI> Lois, <HI>and in thy Mo|ther</HI> Eunice, <HI>and now in thee al&s;o:</HI> Whence the Rea&s;on is plain, if unfeigned faith, and other &s;uch like Gifts of God dwelt in <HI>Timothy,</HI> and in his Mo|ther, and in his Grandmother, then there be Gifts and Graces accompanying Salvation, that dwells in &s;uch as are Effectually Called.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="001604_0012_0FB3E5BA89906510">But the former is plain out of the Text, and therefore &s;o is the latter, in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.6.

<P>The fourth Rea&s;on is taken from the nature and kind of that life which the Members of Chri&s;t do live; thus if the Members of Chri&s;t's Body be li|ving Members, and living Stones, then they live ei|ther by &s;ome gifts of &s;piritual grace created in them, or el&s;e they live the uncreated life of the Holy Gho&s;t, communicated to them; but they do not live the uncreated life of the Holy Gho&s;t com|municated to them; and therefore they live by the

The latter Propo&s;iti|on (or Minor) is as plain; for no Creature (it be|ing finite) can live an increated life which is Infi|nite.

<P>But the Humane Nature of Chri&s;t lived, not the infinite and uncreated life of the Holy Gho&s;t; for the Humane Nature of Chri&s;t was not capable of the Infinite Attributes of the Divine Nature, a|gain&s;t which when <HI>Eutiches</HI> taught otherwi&s;e, <HI>he was Condemned for an Heretick in the General Coun|cil of</HI> Chalcedon.</P>
