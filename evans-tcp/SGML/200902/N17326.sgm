<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>SHAH AULLIM's affairs having been for upwards of the&s;e thirty years &s;o in&s;eparably con|nected with the Ea&s;t-India Company, as to ren|der it difficult to proceed on any intelligible di&s;|play of their complex &s;y&s;tem in India, until what gave ri&s;e to this above hinted connection was eluci|dated, as a &s;cene &s;eemingly in &s;ome mea&s;ure nece&s;|&s;ary to open, before any &s;atisfactory de&s;cription could be given of a people of different religions and &s;ects, the fate of war, revolutions in govern|ment, and unaccountable vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune in an Empire like Indo&s;tan, jumbled together, and rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to the mercenary views of Regents and different made Emperors, tottering on a di&s;located throne, and a &s;et of up&s;tart <HI>Soubahs</HI> and <HI>Nabobs,</HI> &s;et up by the contrivances of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India Company's &s;ervants, at the expence of rapine and blood&s;hed, I re&s;olved, by way of intro|duction, on an illu&s;tration of the matter; and think|ing Mr. Maire has in as few words, and as expre&s;&s;ive terms as conveniently need be, related how the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India Company happened to be ori|ginated, I have taken the liberty to quote him on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>'THE Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India Company,' &s;ays this ingenious gentleman, <Q>was incorporated about the 42d year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, A. D. 1600, and empowered to trade to all the&s;e new countries to the ea&s;tward of the Cape of Good-Hope, exclu&s;ive of all others; but about A.D.
<PB N="x" REF="022380_0007_0FB85963982FF4A0">
1698, application being made to Parliament by private merchants, for laying this trade open, an act pa&s;&s;ed empowering every &s;ubject of England, upon rai&s;ing a &s;um for the &s;upply of government, to trade to the&s;e new parts; upon which a great many &s;ub&s;cribed, and were called the New Ea&s;t-India Company; but the Old Company being ma&s;ters of all the forts on the coa&s;t of India, the New Company found it their intere&s;t to unite with them, and trade with one joint &s;tock, and have ever &s;ince been &s;tiled the United Ea&s;t-India Company.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE mo&s;t con&s;iderable forts and factories and places of trade wherein this Company are con|cerned, are as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> Mocha, or Moco; Aden, Macalla, Shahara, Dofar and Mu&s;cat, in Arabia Felix; Ba&s;&s;ora, I&s;phahan and Gom|broon, in Per&s;ia; Cambaya, Amedabad, Borotch, Swalley, Surat, Bombay, Dabul, Cunvar, Til|lichery, Calicut and Anjengo, on the coa&s;t of Malabar; Fort St. David's, Connonore and Fort St. George, on the coa&s;t of Coromandel; Ma&s;&s;u|lapatam, Vizaggapatam, and Balla&s;ore, in the bay of Bengal, to the northward of the&s;e &s;ettlements. On the i&s;land of Sumutra Achin, Bambat, Cal|loun, Ippo, Bencoolen, or Fort Marlbro' and Fort William at Calcutta; Hugely, Ca&s;&s;imbuzar, Dac|ca, Malda, Midnapore, Monghere, Rajahmawl, Chunamchoprah, Patna, Burdawan, and Chitta|gang, in the province of Bengal; and in China Canton, Amoy and Chy&s;um.</Q></P>
<P>THIS may &s;uffice to inform the reader of the origination of the Ea&s;t-India Company, in which quotation, I have taken the liberty to add &s;ome few important &s;ettlements made by the Engli&s;h &s;ince Mr. Mair's publication. I &s;hall now return to the affairs of <HI>Shah Aullim.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="022380_0008_0FB8596646C11488">HISTORIANS pretty unanimou&s;ly concur in In|do&s;tan's being fir&s;t peopled by emigrants, or war|like adventurers, from Per&s;ia: if &s;o, 'tis equally probable they de&s;cended from the fraternities of Noah, as now it remains an uncontroverted point, that Noah and his followers fir&s;t &s;ettled in the&s;e parts after the deluge. This is tracing them as far back as hi&s;tory will admit, and the oral tradition of the Bramins in India can be relied on. Thus peo|pled from Per&s;ia, as already mentioned, they re|mained 'till Alexander the Great penetrating India with an army and fleet, after meeting with a torrent of oppo&s;ition, but principally from <HI>Porus,</HI> a leading warrior in the&s;e parts, whom he defeated and made pri&s;oner, he cea&s;ed his pur&s;uits at the mouth of the Hyda&s;pes, a branch of the Indus, and made that, &s;eemingly, the limitation of his conque&s;ts; after which, with his armament he &s;ailed down the Indus, and entering the ocean he returned by the way of the Per&s;ian gulph.</P>
<P>AFTER this, Alexander being dead, there is a report in hi&s;tory, that Seleucus &s;urrendered up this va&s;t country to Sandracottus, for 500 elephants, which Sandracottus, it is &s;aid, conquered all India, both this and the other &s;ide the Ganges. The ac|counts we have from that time 'till Augu&s;tus, Se|verus and Aurelian, who received Emba&s;&s;adors from India, from the then reigning monarchs, are ob&s;cure and not to be relied on any more than is the account of Trajans conque&s;t of the&s;e parts; from whence it appears, India remained inhabited by the&s;e differ|ent &s;ets of Per&s;ians 'till invaded by the Saracens, who, it is well known, conquered the major part of it; but without being able to retain long their hold; for after their fir&s;t expedition, Mahmud Gaz|ni, and others made frequent incur&s;ions into Indo&s;|tan, plundered and carried off immen&s;e trea&s;ures
<PB N="xii" REF="022380_0009_0FB85967870499B0">
and riches, and had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of many principalities there, but obliged to relinqui&s;h them and fly, as well as the Moguls, who though they invaded this country A. D. 1300, and extended their victorious arms from it's utmo&s;t ea&s;tern to it's we&s;tern boundaries, and apparently made a compleat conque&s;t of the whole, were obliged, after a bloody defeat, to fly before the face of the Indians and quit the premi&s;es. The&s;e are the only events, as authenticated can be relied on, that took place in Indo&s;tan &s;ince it's fir&s;t being peopled by the Per&s;ians, (as before ob&s;erved &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ab&s;olute de&s;cendants of Noah) 'till about the 14th century, Tamerlane, a Mogul Tartar, with an army of hor&s;e, conquered the&s;e In|do&s;tan domains, and put to the &s;word innumerable of it's inhabitants, and a&s;&s;uming the title of Empe|ror, di&s;tributed the conquered lands among&s;t his countrymen and warriors.</P>
<P>FROM Tamerlane de&s;cended the &s;ucceeding Em|perors in Indo&s;tan, which formerly &s;at on the throne uninterrupted, without any con&s;iderable increa&s;e in their territory, or inte&s;tine or foreign annoyance, 'till Aurengzebe, in the year 1667, mounting the throne with unheard of celerity and valour, ex|tended, &s;word in hand, his dominions to the &s;outhernmo&s;t verge of this immen&s;e country, back to the foot of the mountains of Thibet, reduced the Marattas to implicit obedience, and in &s;hort, compleated the conque&s;t of this Empire, and lived 'till 1707.</P>
<P>JEHANDAR SHAH, grand&s;on to Aurengzebe, after a bloody conte&s;t with his brothers, on a plain within about ten miles of Agra, gaining his point, returned in triumph to the capitol, and was pro|claimed Emperor by his army. Jehandar Shah was &s;oon ma&s;&s;acred by his <HI>Omrahs</HI> and <HI>Aumeers,</HI> they making his attachment to his Empre&s;s an excu&s;e for
<PB N="xiii" REF="022380_0010_0FB8596BD7DCBFD8">
the perpetration of this horrid act; and placed in his &s;tead <HI>Furruk&s;hir,</HI> whom they had employed to &s;trike off his uncle's head.</P>
<P>FURRUKSHIR was not long reigning Emperor of Indo&s;tan; two of his brothers became &s;o obnoxious to him by their arrogance and a&s;&s;umption, that he ordered them to be privately a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; but they di&s;covering the plot, got him dethroned, and after impri&s;oning and &s;trangling him, they rai&s;ed to the throne a grand&s;on of <HI>Aurengzebe's,</HI> a youth about &s;eveenteen years of age, who not an&s;wering the purpo&s;es of his brothers, they &s;oon gave him a do&s;e that &s;ent him to everla&s;ting &s;leep, and put in his place the elder brother, who took the title of <HI>Shah Jahan. Shah Jahan</HI> was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Mahommed Shah,</HI> who giving umbrage to <HI>Nizam Muluck,</HI> the &s;overeign of the <HI>Decan,</HI> and a branch of the Mogul family, this vindictive Prince, though a near rela|tion, a <HI>&s;oubah,</HI> &s;worn &s;ubject, and Generali&s;&s;imo to <HI>Mahommed Shah,</HI> invited &s;ecretly <HI>Nadir Shah,</HI> (for|merly <HI>Thamas Kouli Kan</HI>) to invade the country; which &s;ucceeding in, <HI>Nadir Shah,</HI> after beating <HI>Ma|hommed Shah,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf of the capitol, entered into amicable treaty with the Mogul; but unhappily during the negociation, a di&s;turbance happening among&s;t the natives on the &s;pot, <HI>Nadir Shah</HI> being fired at by a mu&s;ket from the crowd, (though before no ways inclined to draw blood) or|dered his <HI>Cuttleba&s;hes</HI> to &s;tand forth and &s;pare no man they &s;hould fall in with, and from about ten in the morning were to cut away 'till on the top of the <HI>Jummah Mo&s;que,</HI> (as related to me by people who were then on the &s;pot, and pointed out to me the very &s;treets the greate&s;t ma&s;&s;acre happened in, which was the concerted &s;ignal to &s;heath their &s;words,) the Peerzadahs, as u&s;ual, with a loud voice &s;hould call out <HI>Allah! Allah! Arumdall Allah!</HI> &amp;c. one of the daily

invocations they make to God, and a public notice for evening prayer.</P>
<P>AS this event is as remarkable as important, I will without breaking in much with the thread of my Introduction, relate it &s;o as painted to me in lively colours by <HI>Shake Haggabdullah,</HI> and <HI>Shah Nazur|beg,</HI> two men of veracity, who had not only been pre&s;ent to the tran&s;action, but the former in office, then under <HI>Mahommed Shah,</HI> and the latter an <HI>Ha|zarce,</HI> or commander of a thou&s;and of the very <HI>Cuttleba&s;h</HI> hor&s;e employed in this de&s;tructive bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Nimage,</HI> &s;aid this Cuttleba&s;h, our <HI>Patcha</HI> hearing a noi&s;e, mounted, and we followed him, and ordering &s;ilence in the <HI>Chandny Choque,</HI> where a riotous mob had a&s;&s;embled, and making &s;igns for them to be pacific, without being regarded, and &s;hot at by an Indo&s;tan <HI>Burghunda&s;s,</HI> with a large iron ball, he &s;aid they were refractory, and wanted cha&s;ti&s;ement, and concluded by &s;aying, go and <HI>bom|ma Shum&s;here, &s;ofmekund waw tuxeer moph ne me|quoned,</HI> i. e. go clear the way and give them no quar|ter.&mdash;When ordered by <HI>Nadir Shah,</HI> we di&s;per&s;ed our&s;elves among&s;t the crowd, and, <HI>allah hufur&s;t!</HI> what blood did we &s;pill; within the eight hours, <HI>kod|duh ab na punnah Patcha Nadir Shah Sarrah lack,</HI> that is a lack and a quarter, or 125,000 youths and men of all de&s;criptions, fell a &s;acrifice to this conqueror's re&s;entment.</P>
<P>THIS carnage over, the <HI>Patcha</HI> exacted a con|tribution; in the completion of which many cruel|ties were practi&s;ed on the unhappy inhabitants; after which he marched back to his own dominions, in 1739, with the immen&s;e &s;um in &s;pecie of two hun|dred and thirty-one millions &s;terling, including the peacock throne, &amp;c. &s;eventy millions of which fell

<P>THIS was the fir&s;t &s;hock the Mogul Empire &s;uf|fered, and put a final end to the &s;way of the race of Tamerlane. <HI>Nadir Shah</HI> quitting Delhy, he left the Mogul in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his territories to the &s;outhward of the Attock; re&s;erving the pro|vinces before belonging to that Sovereign to the northward of it, for him&s;elf; and to dimini&s;h the &s;overeign authority, by dividing it's intere&s;ts, pre|vailed on <HI>Mahommed Shah,</HI> to make the <HI>&s;oubah &s;hips</HI> throughout his empire, hereditary: but <HI>Nadir Shah</HI> had not long left Indo&s;tan, before the country was invaded by a numerous army of <HI>Rouhillus</HI> and <HI>Patans,</HI> who were oppo&s;ed by the Emperor's &s;on, a youth about eighteen years of age, and totally defeated. During this conte&s;t <HI>Mahommed Shah</HI> was &s;trangled by his Vizier; when the young Prince &s;ucceeding him by the name of <HI>Amet Shah,</HI> (the Emperors in Indo&s;tan ever a&s;&s;uming a new name and title on their a&s;cending the throne) offering as a reward a <HI>mun|&s;ub,</HI> and <HI>phill na&s;han</HI> to any one who &s;hould di&s;cover the con&s;pirators again&s;t his father's life, they were detected and put to death: but a fre&s;h inva&s;ion of the <HI>Patans</HI> and <HI>Marattas</HI> conjoined, being made, <HI>Amet Shah</HI> was dethroned and impri&s;oned in <HI>Selin|gur,</HI> and <HI>Allingheer,</HI> father to the pre&s;ent Mogul, put on the throne by <HI>Ghazodinkan,</HI> the then Grand Vizier:&mdash;But <HI>Allimgheer</HI> tampering &s;ecretly with <HI>Amud Shah,</HI> &s;overeign of Candahar and Pi&s;hoar, in order to purcha&s;e his friend&s;hip, and a quota of troops, to cut off the thread of the obnoxious con|nection &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and <HI>Ghazodinkan,</HI> his letters being intercepted by <HI>Ghazodinkan,</HI> a branch of the Nizam family, that long owed a grudge to their cou&s;ins the de&s;cendants of Tamer|lane, inheriting the honors and profits of the Mogul

Empire, though then very young, a daring and enterpri&s;ing genius, to revenge him&s;elf on the Em|peror, and an&s;wer his &s;anguinary and ambitious views, engaged two <HI>Molvies</HI> who had ju&s;t returned from a pilgrimage they had made to Mecca, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the aged <HI>Allimgheer,</HI> which they effected in the fol|lowing manner:</P>
<P>ALLIMGHEER advanced in years, and though not more remarkable for his attention to fa&s;t or prayer than Mu&s;&s;ulmans in general, yet <HI>Fakirs</HI> and <HI>Hagies</HI> and the&s;e &s;ort of people found ea&s;ier acce&s;s to him than what other Emperors had been u&s;ed to give; and hearing that two <HI>Molvies,</HI> with reverend beards, and of a re&s;pectable a&s;pect, who had arrived from the tomb of Mahomet, and wi&s;hed to pay him homage, he ordered them in his pre&s;ence, who un|der the colour of pre&s;enting him two &s;mall Alcorans, as a <HI>nazur,</HI> at the &s;ame time &s;tabbed him to the vi|tals with their poignards, and the retinue, by pre|meditated orders of young <HI>Ghazodinkan,</HI> threw him from the top of the terras of the palace he was then &s;eated on to breath the fre&s;h air in the evening, and da&s;hed him again&s;t the pavement below; when <HI>Ghazodinkan</HI> a&s;&s;uming the regency, and aiming at the life of <HI>Alligore,</HI> the elde&s;t &s;on of the demi&s;ed Emperor, amid&s;t a tumult that this occa&s;ioned in the capitol, the <HI>Shah Zadah,</HI> by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Ilelroy,</HI> a <HI>Maratta</HI> Chief then at Delhy, made his e&s;cape, and cro&s;&s;ed the Jumna with his Prince&s;s and the &s;elect part of his <HI>Zunnanah,</HI> what jewels he could mu&s;ter, which were to a prodigious amount, and ac|companied by a few Mogul Noblemen; among&s;t whom were Morahjahdowlah, Akborillykan, Bahah|der Dowlah, and others of note, with his <HI>Cojahs, Bahahdarilly Kan, Mecah Almas</HI> and <HI>Mecah Yaw|koote,</HI> incognito, flew acro&s;s Anterbade, and cro&s;&s;ed to the Commong Hills, where he met with an ho&s;pi|table

Why? That by not letting tran&s;pire the legitimacy of Alligore's birth-right, (di&s;puted by <HI>Ghazodinkin,</HI>) though &s;ufficiently known, they might occa&s;ionally have a pretext of a&s;&s;i&s;ting any competitor for the &s;overeignty of In|do&s;tan among the <HI>Maratta</HI> Chiefs again&s;t the right heir, &s;hould <HI>Alligore</HI> ever e&s;trange his affections from them; and even after Ragouby (appointed Re|gent during the minority of <HI>Madarow</HI>) a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated this promi&s;ing young Prince, the Engli&s;h have kept in to all intents and purpo&s;es with <HI>Ragouby,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted him laterly with troops to fight his battles, and op|po&s;e the <HI>Barrow-bye,</HI> and finally, after having at|tempted the reduction of <HI>Pounah,</HI> and the whole Decan, in order to pave the way for this <HI>Ragouby</HI>'s acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, and throw by their con|trivances, the Mogul into the hands of the <HI>Ma|rattas.</HI></P>

<P>FRESH Surveyors, with detachments of Seapoys, were employed to &s;urvey and penetrate the country, in order to find out new towns, <HI>gonges</HI> and <HI>gunges,</HI> and a&s;certain, or rather extend the Company's li|mits.</P>
<P>NO Prince on the throne at Delhy, and the &s;o|vereign authority annihilated, the Princes tributory to the Mogul, viz. <HI>Rajahs, Nabobs, Fa&s;dars,</HI> &amp;c. and others, affecting independence, each one grew de&s;potic in his re&s;pective di&s;trict, exacted and col|lected revenue and taxes of all kinds; favoring the <HI>Zemendars, Banyans</HI> and <HI>Bockalls,</HI> as their avarice, intere&s;t or inclination guided them.</P>

<P>WHAT was the con&s;equence? The pretended ho&s;|pitable reception the <HI>Toppee-wallas</HI> had afforded <HI>Shah Alluim</HI> and his family, had taken wind, and the head <HI>Zemindars, Sowdawgurs,</HI> and <HI>Shroffs,</HI> not only alarmed for their property, but for the &s;afety of their lives, from &s;uch an inundation of de&s;poilers that now over&s;pread the country, converting what of their property they could, into gold or precious &s;tones, for the ea&s;ier conveyance of it, through by ways would travel down to the &s;ettlements of the Engli&s;h <HI>Toppe-wallas,</HI> for protection. The Mo|gul had &s;hown them an example, and a report was circulated among&s;t the Mu&s;&s;ulmans, (that <HI>Allah,</HI> i.e. God, in the Arabic language) and among&s;t the <HI>Hindoos,</HI> that <HI>Bogwan,</HI> i. e. the &s;upreme God, had made choice of the tribe of <HI>Hadgerat Ee&s;ah,</HI> to be an engine to redre&s;s their grievances.</P>
<P>THESE families of merchants and others &s;warming into the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements, among&s;t whom were many monied men, the Company's &s;ervants made a point of receiving them in the mo&s;t courteous manner; the&s;e invited others, and their &s;ettlements became, &s;eemingly, a&s;ylums for the rich or ruined emigrants of Indo&s;tan.</P>
<P>THIS migration was productive of many imme|diate and future advantages to the <HI>Sircar,</HI> for the&s;e men, particularly the <HI>Banyans,</HI> early making the Company acquainted with the pecuniary abilities of the <HI>Riets</HI> in the adjacent and remoter parts of their new acquired territory, pointed out to them <HI>Gong&eacute;s Gunges,</HI> and even towns, in rece&s;&s;es they had never

<P>THE military reputation of the Company in|crea&s;ed daily. Major Clive (&s;ince Lord Clive) had enhanced the idea of their valour by his conduct. He had gained the battle of Pla&s;&s;ey, A.

and an army employed to conquer him and reduce him to rea&s;on, under the command of Major Car|nac. Notwith&s;tanding a menacing letter this officer &s;ent him, when fortified within the walls of <HI>Patma,</HI> he &s;acrificed to his re&s;entment a number of Engli&s;h gentlemen in their factory there; employing one Sombra, a German officer, to execute his orders. This was during the government of Mr. Van&s;ittart, who had been the means of rai&s;ing <HI>Co&s;&s;imally</HI> to the <HI>Mu&s;nud.</HI>&mdash;But all friend&s;hip being now at an end between him and the Company, he was pro|&s;cribed throughout the empire by the Engli&s;h, and a reward offered for his head of ten lack of <HI>rupees.</HI> A new <HI>Soubah</HI> was &s;et up at Maxedabads, and many events took place between that and the fa|mous battle of Baxar, where to end a di&s;pute long &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the Grand Vizier <HI>Sujahdowlah,</HI> and the Company, Hector Munro was employed again&s;t him, and beat him fairly in the field, and took him pri&s;oner on his elephant, with a &s;mall party of European hor&s;e, after the battle; who, &s;ubdued, and in the hands of the Engli&s;h, was glad to enter into an amicable treaty with them.</P>
<P>SUJAHDOWLAH, one of the mo&s;t voluptuous and luxuriant Princes that ever appeared in A&s;ia, at amity now with the Company, but jealous of their power, by degrees added to his military force an army of twenty thou&s;and well di&s;ciplined <HI>Seapoys,</HI> and &s;et afoot a large train of artillery, ca&s;t and con|ducted by one Mon&s;ieur Sam&s;on, a French officer, his <HI>Douan</HI> had invited into his &s;ervice; which artil|lery, was under the direction of this Commandant, and a number of Europeans, the lowe&s;t of them paid at the rate of five rupees per day, and a num|ber at wages from three hundred to one thou&s;and rupees per month.</P>

The <HI>Jaghire</HI> alone of Lord Clive was near eighty thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling per annum, an hereditary e&s;tate &s;ettled on him by the Mogul; be&s;ides upwards of two millions of &s;pecie, and one hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds worth of jewels and pearls.</P>
<P>THE means by which the&s;e rapid and immen&s;e for|tunes were acquired, though too well known by this time not to be notorious to all Indo&s;tan, if not to America and the European world, were at fir&s;t but &s;ugge&s;ted, until men who had been treated hard by the&s;e de&s;potic Lords of the Ea&s;t, though Euro|peans of repute and unexceptionably connected at home, among whom was Mr. Bolts, a free merchant of Calcutta, who with others, laying open at home the illicit and unwarrantable means by which the Company's &s;ervants in India acquired their fortunes, and the Company's charter that had been granted them by Parliament having nigh expired, it put the Government upon making an inve&s;tigation in|to the Ea&s;t-India Company's affairs; the re&s;ult of which was, that they &s;hould &s;urrender up their Charter at the expiration of the limited time; but the Court of Directors de&s;iring a &s;ufficient time to &s;ettle their affairs in, it was granted them, on condition that they paid to the King four hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling per annum; which they readily a&s;&s;enting to, they carried on their bu&s;ine&s;s as u&s;ual. About this time, Mr. Van&s;ittart was in|ve&s;ted with full powers to go to India, and with a number of new nominated officers, civil and mili|tary,

This circum|&s;tance, however unfavorable to the intere&s;t of the proprietors of &s;tock, and Company in general, was a &s;troke of fortune that reverberated with <HI>eclat</HI> on the former &s;tandards in India, for apprized of the mea&s;ures Government had taken to &s;ecure to them|&s;elves &s;ome of the great emoluments the Company &s;hared before among&s;t them&s;elves, and apprehen&s;ive of this &s;tep's being followed by a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution of their Company's exclu&s;ive right to the India trade, (which &s;ugge&s;tions were not a little &s;trength|ened by a report having been propagated that the territorial revenue of Bengal would be inve&s;ted in the right of the Crown,) prompted them to be the more &s;trenuous in their pecuniary pur&s;uits, and to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e many unju&s;tifiable means for the &s;peedier accompli&s;hment of their ends, which have &s;o &s;tigmatized this body of men, and di&s;graced the character of the Briti&s;h nation.</P>

<P>YOU de&s;ired me to write to you on my arrival in India, and promi&s;ed in return to an&s;wer my let|ters. I &s;end you this by the &s;hip I took my pa&s;&s;age in, now on the eve of her departure for Europe.</P>
<P>On our leaving the Downs, having a leading wind down channel, we &s;oon cleared the land, and running between the <HI>Azores,</HI> i. e. the We&s;tern I&s;lands and the main continent of Europe, made the i&s;land of Madeira in about fourteen days; where, without coming to an anchor, we took on board 150 pipes of Madeira wine, (a drink highly acceptable to the Europeans in India) and on our way to the &s;outh|ward, anchored at St. Jago, one of the Cape de Verd i&s;lands; where, after fitting up our empty water ca&s;ks, and taking in poultry, goats, and other re|fre&s;hments, we weighed and &s;teered to the &s;outh, when Teneriffe remaining in &s;ight 'till it's peek or vertex, which terminates in a conical point and per|vades the clouds; (the whole i&s;land being but a ba&s;e as it were, to this pyramid) was by a meridian ob|&s;ervation of the &s;un, vi&s;ible even at the di&s;tance of 150 nautic miles, which argued the great height of that remarkable mountain. We continued on our way to the Cape of Good-Hope, the &s;outhernmo&s;t promontory of Africa; having cro&s;&s;ed the equinox|ial line in the longitue of about 19 degrees we&s;t from the meridian of London.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="022380_0024_0FB8598470C5EE70">You have learned the u&s;e of the globes, and mu&s;t recollect that if London is brought under the gra|duated edge of the brazen meridian, and then the &s;phere moved on it's axis until the Cape of Good-Hope is brought under the &s;ame artificial circle, that the difference of longitude between the two places can be obtained by counting the degrees con|tained between the two meridians; and in like man|ner for any other two places whatever. In cro&s;&s;ing the Equator, we had thunder &s;qualls, calms, and heavy rains, attended with &s;harp lightning, which is frequent in the&s;e climes; after which, falling in with the S. E. i. e. &s;outh ea&s;t trade wind, which blows as con&s;tant in that quarter of the compa&s;s to the &s;outh|ward of the equator, as the N. E. i. e. the north ea&s;t trade wind, blows to the northward of it be|tween the two Tropics, viz. Cancer and Capricorn. We made the mo&s;t of the wind, and doubling the Cape of Good-Hope, after very tremendous wea|ther, which obliged us at times to lie <HI>hull too,</HI> with our yards and topma&s;ts &s;truck, and lower yards at portland, in a mountainous &s;ea; and at other times to &s;cud before menacing waves for life and death, under a clo&s;e reefed main-top&s;ail la&s;h'd down to the cap of the ma&s;t, thinking this the &s;afe&s;t to &s;cud under, as the loftie&s;t &s;ail that could be carried, and mo&s;t out of the reach of our briny &s;tern-cha&s;ers, the bellowing foaming billows that followed our &s;hip, and every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;urge menaced our &s;tern. In this dangerous and boi&s;terous &s;ea&s;on of the year (it being the winter of this part of the globe) hawl|ing up to the northward, to u&s;e a &s;ea phra&s;e, we entered the Mo&s;ambique channel; (which ca&s;t your eye on a map of the world, you will find lies between the i&s;land of Madaga&s;car, which is 1000 miles in length, and the main continent of Africa) within the cour&s;e of a week we anchored at Joanna, one of

the Comora I&s;lands (in &s;ight of the above menti|oned i&s;land of Madaga&s;car.) This Comora is a &s;mall i&s;land, but of a beautiful appearance, viewed from the &s;ea; it ri&s;ing all round with an ea&s;y a&s;|cent from the beach, in little &s;welling hills project|ing out from the main body of the mountain, of which the bulk of the i&s;land is &s;eemingly compo&s;ed. This mountain, and it's hills and intermediate val|lies, are covered with trees and verdure, which pro|duce dates, lemons, limes, and tropical fruits in general; fronting the little bay where the &s;hips lie at anchor is the watering place, which is a na|tural receiver of &s;ine &s;weet water, precipitated from the top of the i&s;land down a channel formed by the celerity of the &s;tream, which running in a &s;erpen|tine direction through the bu&s;hes and vallies, has a plea&s;ing effect that cannot but attract the &s;ight. About one third of a mile from this watering place, is a compact little village, compo&s;ed of two &s;mall narrow &s;treets that run parallel to each other about two hundred yards in length; it's hou&s;es are &s;mall, and neatly built with &s;tone and cement, and was the work of the noted Avery, the pirate, and his peo|ple, who made this i&s;land their principal rendez|vous. This place is remarkable (as are all the Co|mora i&s;lands, likewi&s;e Madaga&s;car) for a breed of bats, or flying &s;quirrels, the colour of foxes, as big as cats in general, and as full of hair and fur as wea&s;els; as well as mococks and mungoo&s;es, ani|mals in make like greyhounds, but no bigger in their bodies than a large cat, with long bu&s;hy tails, which are both held in e&s;timation in India and Eu|rope, particularly the mococks, which are the co|lour of dark &s;ables, but covered with a thick fur. The&s;e animals the ladies in Europe affect &s;uch fond|ne&s;s for, that they frequently permit them to wrap their &s;oft bu&s;hy tails round their necks, and repo&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="022380_0026_0FB859880AF94F98">
with their heads on their bo&s;oms. This i&s;land al&s;o abounds with a race of &s;mall bulls and cows, about the &s;ize of yearlings, which are very fle&s;hy and fat; they have a hunch on their &s;houlders, and lit|tle horns, very &s;harp, but no longer than a man's thumb.</P>
<P>At this i&s;land we watered and refre&s;hed, and then proceeded through the Maldavia I&s;lands for Bengal, after which making in our way, the I&s;land of Cey|lon, (famous for it's cinnamon, the &s;mell of which was very perceptible in the neighbourhood of the land) we entered the Bay of Bengal, and in about forty-eight hours di&s;covered the high land of Bal|la&s;ore, when taking a pilot on board that had been looking out for the Europe &s;hips, we &s;tood on for the mouth of the river Hugely, a branch of the Great Ganges, a very critical navigation, the mouth of this river being frontiered with &s;ands, &s;ome of which &s;hift, and are equally blocked up with &s;wampy i&s;lands, infe&s;ted with tygers of an enormous &s;ize, and aligators, al&s;o large &s;erpents. The pilot had not been long on board before (whether through his ob&s;tinacy or the precipitancy of the Captain) the &s;hip &s;hallowing her water, &s;he &s;truck on the tail of the ea&s;tern brace, one of the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ands in that vicinity, and had very nigh been lo&s;t; but e&s;caping this danger, &s;he anchored at Ingillee the latter part of July, when, with the ladies we had on board, &s;ome Company's &s;ervants, and other pa&s;&s;engers, I proceeded in a <HI>budgero</HI> to Calcutta.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t part of my letter is written in a &s;tile calculated for the peru&s;al of a &s;eafaring gentleman apparently, rather than that of a young lady; but as intended for your amu&s;ement and information, as introductory to the letters to come, I have hazarded it's in&s;ertion.</P>

<P>ON our arrival at Calcutta, which was the day following, we pa&s;&s;ed by Fort-William, and the <HI>budgero</HI> gaining the front of the &s;ettlement, &s;he hawled into a landing called Bibby-Watts, i. e. the Woman Watt's landing, where a number of boats, different in their con&s;truction from any I had &s;een before,&mdash;<HI>burrs, dinghees, budgeros,</HI> and Moor <HI>pun|kys,</HI> added to the exotic appearance of the inha|bitants a&s;&s;embled in innumerable bodies, (Moors, <HI>Genloos,</HI> Armenians, <HI>Callo-fringhees,</HI> or Country-born Chri&s;tians,) men, women and children, all in general remarkably well dre&s;&s;ed, particularly in the &s;tile of the country, who I was informed were of the Gentoo tribes, attracted my attention, as well that of the re&s;t of the pa&s;&s;engers; and being given to under&s;tand that &s;omething extraordinary was to be tran&s;acted on or about the &s;pot we had come to at, being as well &s;ituated in the varandos of the <HI>budgero</HI> as we could wi&s;h, we waited the event of the&s;e novel preparations, and in the interim through the means of the <HI>mangy,</HI> under who&s;e direction the boat was, who &s;poke Engli&s;h in common tollerably well, I informed my&s;elf which were the different ca&s;ts or tribes among&s;t this numerous a&s;&s;emblage of people; who pointed them out to me much to my &s;atisfaction, &s;aying, that is a <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulman,</HI>&mdash;that is a Hindoo,&mdash;this a <HI>Callo-fringhee,</HI>&mdash;that an Armenian. This man, from his childhood employed by Euro|peans, had acquired a con&s;iderable &s;hare of expe|rience in polemical matters, and among&s;t other things could tell us, that though the <HI>Toppe-wallees</HI> governed Bengal and all the coa&s;t of India, and did

as they plea&s;ed with the <HI>Bad&s;haws</HI> and <HI>Nabobs,</HI> there were Moor men enough, &s;tanch <HI>Shakes, Syeds, Mo|guls</HI> and <HI>Patans,</HI> without the <HI>Gentoos,</HI> to bury them all alive in a day, with but a handful of &s;and each, had they but courage; for that there were, accord|ing to the account of the Bramins, who knew the number of the inhabitants, ten millions of Mu&s;&s;ul|mans in Indo&s;tan, and not half one hundred thou|&s;and Toppe-wallees, including the <HI>Callo-fringhees</HI> in all; but, added the <HI>Mangy,</HI> &s;o immen&s;e a number of <HI>Hindoos,</HI> that were they not as timid as women, without any other weapons than even <HI>bamboos</HI> in their hands, they could drive both Mahometans and <HI>Fringhees</HI> out of the country; for that there were ten Hindoos for one Mu&s;&s;ulman, which made an hundred million of <HI>Gentoos</HI> in all, but the <HI>Hindoos</HI> are infidels and idolaters, &s;ays this man, and <HI>Pyrum|bur</HI> will not let them rule over true believers, though he permits the <HI>Toppe-wallees</HI> to be a &s;courge to them for a time. This and other di&s;cour&s;e he held us while I was &s;urveying the crowd, and paying at|tention to their dre&s;&s;es, which I &s;hall in their proper place de&s;cribe minutely. The <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Gentoos</HI> dre&s;s alike, with <HI>jammers</HI> and <HI>turbans</HI> of fine white mu&s;lin or callico, and &s;a&s;hes of the &s;ame, and <HI>cry&s;|&s;is</HI> &s;tuck into their &s;a&s;hes, which are bound tight around their wai&s;ts, and have edges to them of gold fringe, &amp;c. The&s;e <HI>jammers</HI> are gowns made much like the women's in America or Europe, but with long &s;leeves that taper as they come down to the wri&s;ts, and are &s;o long in general, both before and behind, that when walking the &s;treets they are un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of gathering up a bunch in one hand, to keep the border from being trampled un|der foot: the&s;e <HI>jammers</HI> are bound with &s;ilk, mode or ribband, or el&s;e with a binding of the &s;ame &s;tuff they are made of. Their turbans are traver&s;ed chequer|wi&s;e,
<PB N="7" REF="022380_0029_0FB859918D382BA8">
and the ends of &s;ome of them a foot and others a &s;pan deep, which they take care to let come out at the top, by way of ornament. Over this tur|ban frequently is tied obliquely to the forehead, a hand&s;ome &s;hawl, handkerchief, or a &s;mall &s;ilk or &s;attin &s;a&s;h, and fringed with gold or &s;ilver. The Moors e&s;teeming them&s;elves Seapoys, wear &s;words on all occa&s;ions, and when in <HI>&s;awawry,</HI> or on a vi&s;it, carry in their hands &s;hields made of Rhinoceros or wild Buffalo's hide, thick enough to &s;end off the blow of a &s;cymitar, but not an arrow or mu&s;ket ball. The <HI>Gentoos</HI> go equally armed, but none but <HI>Rajahpoots,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;ight, and <HI>Bramins</HI> of di&s;tinction among&s;t them, wear any other arms than a <HI>Chury</HI> or <HI>Chry&s;s,</HI> except on particular occa|&s;ions, as, for in&s;tance, on celebration of their nup|tials, or the fe&s;tivals held among&s;t them&s;elves, when the addition of the &s;word and &s;hield take place, though a mere matter of parade. The&s;e two ca&s;ts of people made up the a&s;&s;embled crowd, excepting a few Armenians and <HI>Callo-fringheees</HI> that were in|termixed with them, commonly called Portugueze, of which latter there are a great number in Bengal, and in all the European &s;ettlements in India. The Armenians are a fair complexioned people, and dre&s;s much like the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Gentoos,</HI> except their caps, which they wear in&s;tead of turbans, which are mo&s;tly made of black velvet, or broad cloth. The Portu|gueze or <HI>Callo-fringhees</HI> dre&s;s exactly like the Euro|peans, and being as remarkable for their vanity as their &s;uper&s;titious attachment to the papi&s;t religion, endeavour to envy each other in finery and equipage. The <HI>Gentoo</HI> women and girls from all the neigh|bouring parts had likewi&s;e gathered together on this occa&s;ion, and were mixed with the multitude, but few or no Moor women were to be &s;een, except &s;ome of inferior &s;tamp; the females among&s;t the
<PB N="8" REF="022380_0030_0FB8599496D1CFE8">
Mahometans in India, like the women belonging to the Turks in A&s;ia and Europe, not expo&s;ing them|&s;elves to public view, nor going out without being compleatly covered from head to foot with a veil. The&s;e <HI>Gentoo</HI> women in general are dre&s;&s;ed in a mu&s;|lin or callico <HI>pizwawge,</HI> re&s;embling the gown I have de&s;cribed the men wear, which I &s;hall be more particular in the account of hereafter; under this <HI>pizwawge</HI> they wear an upper and under &s;kirt, the upper one &s;ome brilliant colour and the under one fine linen: they wear no &s;hoes, but go barefoot through the &s;treets, except the Ranahs, i. e. wives and daughters of Rajahs, and Hindoo ladies of the fir&s;t rank, who keep them&s;elves as hidden as the Moor women from the &s;ight of men. Over the <HI>pizwawge</HI> they wear a <HI>lungah,</HI> and over that a <HI>de|putah;</HI> the <HI>lungah</HI> is to cover them when they are bathing and the <HI>deputah</HI> is their veil, both which they throw over them in a carele&s;s manner, but will occa&s;ionally peep out from under their veils, and di&s;cover their faces as they pa&s;s through the &s;treets, or remain &s;tanding in a crowd. The palms of their hands and the &s;oles of their feet are tinged with <HI>mindy,</HI> as likewi&s;e their finger and toe-nails, which being a beautiful pink colour &s;hews to no di&s;advantage. They wear rings in their right no|&s;trils and the middle &s;tnip of their no&s;es; the rings they carry in their no&s;trils are frequently the di|ameter of a dollar, and &s;ometimes not exceeding that of a pi&s;tareen, which always have two preci|ous &s;tones, &s;aphires, rubies or amethy&s;ts, with pearls between the two jewels &s;u&s;pended, and the &s;ame to the rings that are reeved through the &s;nip of their no&s;es, which are le&s;s than the no&s;tril rings, being &s;o contrived as only to admit the jewels &s;u&s;|pended thereto to come down to the upper-lip.&mdash; We had not long amu&s;ed our&s;elves with contemplat|ing

this crowd, when the &s;un &s;etting below the ho|rizon of a beautiful &s;erene &s;ky, I was &s;truck with the &s;plendid and &s;udden appearance of &s;ome thou|&s;and little pagodas, or Indian temples of different magnitudes and proportions, (all of them painted and gilded, from three to &s;ix feet in height, with their re&s;pective porticos, galleries, ballu&s;trades, tur|rets, domes and &s;pires,) launched from the &s;trand; and numbers of plea&s;ure boats in different parts of the river, on flat boards of &s;ufficient bearings to float them; which illuminated with little gilded ta|pers within &s;ide and without, reflecting on and &s;hin|ing through ca&s;ements of tran&s;parent i&s;ingla&s;s, ex|hibited in a very advantageous light the images that were fixed on pede&s;tals in the centre of the&s;e edifi|ces: &s;ome of <HI>Bramin</HI> bulls, and peacocks with their tails expanded, and others of <HI>Jagarnaut</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t|nou Swamy,</HI> and different idols wor&s;hipped by the&s;e deluded uninformed people. The&s;e glittering tem|ples had no &s;ooner been launched, than a report as &s;mart and as loud as mu&s;ketoons, like a feu-de-joye or &s;treet firing, was heard from all quarters. They were a number of Chine&s;e crackers, di&s;charged from the hands of boys, dre&s;&s;ed, painted and decora|ted with jewels, on the occa&s;ion; the boys in the&s;e parts wearing necklaces and earrings, with rings in their no&s;es like the women; and even men, when full dre&s;&s;ed, will never appear without them. The&s;e crackers are neatly made up and bound tight with &s;mall wires, cat-gut and Indian weed, and filled with &s;trong double fortified ela&s;tic powder; thus artfully confined though the interior tube that con|tains the powder, will be no bigger than a large por|cupine quill: on being fired they make an incredible loud report.</P>
<P>This &s;cene was novel and plea&s;ing enough to have attended to awhile, but the turning of the tide

again&s;t a breeze of wind that began to increa&s;e, &s;oon over&s;et this fragile navigation, extingui&s;hed the luminaries of the&s;e little floating temples, and immerged in the &s;tream the&s;e various Indo&s;tan dei|ties, amid&s;t the repeated &s;houts and acclamations of the Gentoo tribes on the river and adjacent &s;hores, and compleated what the Europeans in Bengal call drowning Jagernaut: this day happening to be the celebration of an annual fe&s;tival held in commemo|ration of that Pagan divinity, who by the <HI>Gentoos</HI> is looked upon as a mediator between <HI>Bogwau</HI> and man.</P>

<P>JAGERNAUT drowned, as I wrote you by the la&s;t year's &s;hipping, the different equipages by this time brought down to the landing for conveying we new-comers to our re&s;pective connections, <HI>viz.</HI> phaetons, chariots and palanquins, in di&s;embark|ing we were felecitated on our arrival by &s;ome gen|tlemen on the &s;pot, the ladies handed into carriages and drove to the government (it being an invariable rule for every gentlewoman who is &s;ent from Europe to vi&s;it the Governor fir&s;t) who never parts with her 'till he delivers her into &s;afe hands, and &s;ees her honorably accommodated. The&s;e ladies, daugh|ters to gentlemen of narrow fortunes, with the con&s;ent of their friends, annually, &s;ome two or three in a &s;hip, go to India, where having nobody on the &s;pot to &s;upercede them, they in a &s;hort time make
<PB N="11" REF="022380_0033_0FB8599ACAF15888">
a conque&s;t of &s;ome gentleman or other, advanced in the Company's &s;ervice; for no one le&s;s than a factor dare pre&s;ume to think of an European lady, nor will the Governor (without who&s;e con&s;ent they cannot be married) admit of &s;uch a match, which re&s;trictions &s;ecures to them con&s;iderable &s;ettlements, and I believe an in&s;tance never was known for a young maiden of &s;potle&s;s character not making a brilliant fortune by a trip to Bengal. The women bowled off in their &s;uperb carriages; a palanquin that had been &s;ent for me by Mr. Lambert, a &s;enior merchant in the Company's &s;ervice, I &s;tepped into it, and was &s;hewn how to fix my&s;elf without en|dangering it's tilting, and orders given in a language that I did not under&s;tand, (as I was afterwards in|formed) to carry me to the hou&s;e of a Mr. Middle|ton, a gentleman then in Council at Calcutta. As this vehicle is not only a &s;hining but a nece&s;&s;ary equipage in India, I will give you a &s;hort de&s;cription of it, and refer you to my glo&s;&s;ary for further par|ticulars. A <HI>palanquin</HI> may with great propriety be called a valant couch; it is oblong in it's make, and be&s;pread with mattra&s;&s;es, and a &s;ilk or &s;attin covering called an <HI>epinjary,</HI> that is &s;pread over the arch of the <HI>bamboo,</HI> to keep out the dew and &s;un beams, and is carried by four men at a time on a thick <HI>bamboo,</HI> that forms an arch over the main body of the <HI>palanquin,</HI> and runs projecting out &s;ome &s;ix feet before, and about four feet behind; two of the men keeping forward and the other two in the rear. The&s;e <HI>bamboos</HI> have their ends neatly covered with leather, and the arches of them with velvet or broad-cloth. Three hand&s;ome ta&s;&s;els hang under the <HI>bamboo,</HI> the body of the middle one as big as an o&s;trich egg, and the ta&s;&s;els in general a couple of &s;pans deep. The&s;e are of u&s;e and ornament both, for bobbing this way and that way with the motion

of the <HI>palanquin,</HI> they &s;erve to keep off the flies and mu&s;quitoes, with which this country abounds. At the but end of the fore part of the <HI>bamboo</HI> is fixed in ca&s;t metal, gold, &s;ilver or bra&s;s, the head and claws of a dragon, a griffin, or crocodile; and at the other end of the <HI>bamboo,</HI> the tail and po&s;terior parts of the &s;ame animal that is fixed in the front: and a palanquin being a mark of honor and di&s;tinc|tion in Indo&s;tan, no &s;ubject pre&s;umes to mount one, except authorized by the Mogul him&s;elf, a <HI>Soubah, Nabob</HI> or <HI>Rajah;</HI> which right remains hereditay, or only during office or life, at the will of the Prince who confered it.&mdash;Thus fixed in my <HI>palanquin,</HI> though in a very inexpert manner, as it then &s;tood on it's four feet on the ground, the &s;ides of it were held by two men, whil&s;t the bearers &s;tooped down and dexterou&s;ly rai&s;ed it up by clapping the ends of the <HI>bamboo</HI> under their &s;houlders, when they &s;et off in a dog trot, at a rapid rate, &s;inging out as they jogged along, in a plaintive tone, a kind of a &s;ong I did not under&s;tand. In this way I was conveyed to the hou&s;e of my friend, where the <HI>palanquin</HI> was &s;et down, and I conducted up &s;tairs and received by Mr. Middleton, who introduced me to his acquain|tance, and gave orders for a <HI>notch,</HI> and as we pa&s;|&s;ed up and down the varando, among&s;t other things told me that he would furni&s;h me with a <HI>banyan,</HI> when his <HI>carrany</HI> called me a&s;ide to inform me there were &s;ent into an apartment de&s;tined for me, two bags of <HI>rupees;</HI> upon which I took the hint, and with this <HI>carrany</HI> withdrew, who counted out to me two thou&s;and <HI>rupees,</HI>&mdash;I depo&s;ited them in my e&s;crutoire, which was no &s;ooner done, than a fat &s;hort man of a &s;traw coloured complexion, accompanied by his &s;on, a boy about twelve years of age, acco&s;ted me: this man was a <HI>Gentoo,</HI> of the <HI>bramin</HI> ca&s;t, and a &s;ub&s;tantial <HI>banyan.</HI> They both were richly dre&s;&s;ed

in the &s;tile of the country, and had all the appear|ance of people of credit. The &s;ubject they waited on me was that of my employing the father as my <HI>banyan;</HI> who producing a line from my friend, I ac|cepted of his offer, with a <HI>nazar,</HI> he pre&s;ented me, con&s;i&s;ting of five gold <HI>mohars</HI> and three <HI>&s;icca rupees,</HI> which was looked upon, I was informed, as an in|dication of an agreement; when they paid their compliments by meeting their right hands with their foreheads, and letting them fall in a graceful man|ner while they bowed their bodies, (which is called making a <HI>&s;allam</HI>)&mdash;after this they retired, and left me to my private cogitations. My friend returning after &s;upper, we went into a large &s;aloon, when a company of women, about fifteen in number, ad|vanced as it were, in the front of a theatre, by <HI>ty|phas,</HI> i.e. &s;ets, with their <HI>bajana wallas,</HI> and paid their compliments by <HI>&s;allaming</HI> us in the manner the <HI>banyan</HI> and his &s;on <HI>&s;allamed</HI> me; the women varying nothing in this particular from the men, in Indo&s;tan.

<P>THE girls to whom I have hitherto addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf from India, corre&s;pond with each other, and will be as proud to tran&s;mit you my letters as I am to under&s;tand by yours that you wi&s;hed for a peru&s;al of them: in future, it will be improbable I &s;hould neglect writing to you the fir&s;t. Your letter I have made the frontispiece to my Europe mi&s;cellanies. The letters antecedent to this, &s;hould ere now, by the &s;teps I am informed you had taken, have fallen into your hands. The company &s;eated, (as I wrote Loui&s;a ******'s &s;i&s;ter in my la&s;t letter) afforded me an opportunity of contemplating their per&s;ons and examining their dre&s;s, both which I &s;hall give you a &s;ketch of in my letters to the ladies I corre&s;|pond with in general.</P>
<P>The dre&s;&s;es of the&s;e females, clo&s;ely copied from the fa&s;hions of the Seraglios, which are con&s;tant &s;tandards for the women in tho&s;e parts to regulate them&s;elves by in that important article of dre&s;s and the decoration of their per&s;ons; it being to be re|marked that the&s;e A&s;iatics are as tenacious in the points of dre&s;s, and any &s;ignificant addition or di|munition might be made thereunto by a predomi|nant party of belles in the Seraglio of the Mogul, Vizier or <HI>Soubah,</HI> as ever a &s;et of the fir&s;t rank la|dies that ever formed a route in London or Paris. To return from which digre&s;&s;ion, the Indo&s;tan wo|men wear &s;hifts which differ but little in make from tho&s;e of the European women, and under their
<PB N="15" REF="022380_0037_0FB859A49D697310">
&s;kirts, which are always made of ti&s;&s;ue or a brilliant coloured &s;ilk or &s;attin, &s;et off with a deep gold or &s;ilver fringe below, and as often embroidered with &s;prigs of the &s;ame, they wear likewi&s;e a white li|nen petticoat, and within that &s;triped &s;ilk drawers, drawn round the wai&s;t with &s;ilk, knit, or wove ban|dages, and in the &s;ame manner drawn tight round the ancles of their legs; whil&s;t the <HI>Gentoo</HI> women, who differ from the other Indo&s;tan women in this particlar, di&s;pen&s;e with the&s;e drawers and wear an extraordinary &s;kirt in their &s;tead. Over the dre&s;s above de&s;cribed goes the <HI>pizwawge,</HI> a robe or gown made in the following manner; two pieces of mu&s;|lin are laid flat on each other like &s;heets of writing paper in a quire, then doubled from the middle, which making them fourfold adds to the &s;trength of them, and makes the whole better calculated for the lower part of the <HI>pizwawge,</HI> which forms a &s;kirt with a hand&s;ome gold border to it of about a &s;pan deep all round; the&s;e pieces of mu&s;lin being fini&s;hed off in that manner while fabricating on the bamboo &s;tands, are made of &s;uch lengths as to admit occa|&s;ionally their being converted into <HI>pizwawgee</HI>'s, in the making of which by doubling the lengths to|gether, it may ea&s;ily be conceived how the ends of the&s;e pieces by making them meet, may be contrived to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of a border to the lower part of the <HI>pizwawge,</HI> which the <HI>Zundirjees,</HI> i.e. the women taylors, pay particular attention to, as well as the length of the train of the <HI>pizwawgees,</HI> in the making of which, with the Indo&s;tan ladies they mu&s;t never be infringed on. In order to accompli&s;h this, the <HI>Zundirjees</HI> employed for that purpo&s;e in mea&s;ur|ing the lady the dre&s;s is intended for, begin by tak|ing her circumference from ju&s;t below her &s;houlder-blades, and that part of the body that coincides with them, not from the &s;mall of the back above
<PB N="16" REF="022380_0038_0FB859A6FAEBC938">
the hips, according to the cu&s;tom of the American and European ladies. This done, they cut off the upper part of the folded mu&s;lins and lay them apart for the body or ve&s;t of the robe, whil&s;t the part that forms the &s;kirt is drawn up into a convenient number of gatherings; then they adju&s;t the body, and fix it to the &s;kirt to their liking, making the hind part terminate in a train as propo&s;ed, while the fore part but barely meeting the floor has loops to rai&s;e it and keep it from incumbering the feet, by contriving it &s;o as to admit of the border's ju&s;t reaching the in&s;tep; which contraction of the robe di&s;covering (as the party walks or dances) the glit|tering annulets, and large hoop rings incru&s;ted with pearls and gems of different culours with which her toes, ancles and legs (if a female of the lea&s;t pre|ten&s;ions) will be in a manner inca&s;ed, whil&s;t her train flowing behind &s;weeping the rich Per&s;ian carpet &s;he treads on, exhibits to great advantage the graceful|ne&s;s of the per&s;on, and elegance of the dre&s;s.</P>
<P>I am addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to ladies, or I &s;hould per|haps be le&s;s diffu&s;ive on a &s;ubject that by the other &s;ex might be thought effeminate; in future I will be le&s;s minute, but beg leave to fini&s;h the detail of an Indo&s;tan lady's attire in the manner I have began.</P>
<P>I will now write in the plural number, and not confine my&s;elf to the dre&s;&s;es of the women in que&s;|tion, their di&s;po&s;ition and manners in particular, but treat of them in general.</P>
<P>The &s;leeves of Indo&s;tan ladies robes are fixed to their <HI>pizwawgees</HI> much in the &s;ame manner the Ame|rican or European women's gowns are, only the&s;e growing narrower by degrees are made to extend to about half a yard, when pulled out, beyond their finger ends, that by that contrivance a number of mu&s;lin ringlets may be made to form a pretty cuff when &s;hoved up above the wri&s;t, without concealing

<P>THESE veils I had promi&s;ed you a de&s;cription of are about three ells long, and an ell and one quar|ter wide, of an azure, purple, pink, green, &s;carlet, or any fancy colour whatever; and though of an extreme fine manufactured mu&s;lin, are &s;o thick as not to be tran&s;parent but from within &s;ide: they have all gold or &s;ilver edges to them of about four fingers wide, and the ends terminate like the ends of the &s;a&s;hes or bottoms of their <HI>pizwawgees,</HI> in a

deep gold or &s;ilver border, and as one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential appendages of an oriental lady's dre&s;s, as I have already intimated, are by them manouver'd and handled with as inexplicable art and inimitable ea&s;e and oconomy: whether when travelling in their <HI>pa|lanquins, doolies</HI> or hackerries abroad, or when walk|ing in their varandoes, &s;aloons or gardens at home, or &s;itting down in public, or t&egrave;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te in private with a friend, it matters not, the veil mu&s;t be intro|duced. When in a &s;tate of real or &s;eeming de&s;pon|dence, the head reclined on the arm inwrapt in one end of the veil, a part of the face will be di&s;cover|able under the &s;hining border of the other end or golden edges, with the marks of anxiety or care de|picted thereon. At funerals the veil the di&s;con&s;o|late mother, &s;i&s;ter or relict, throws over her in &s;uch a manner as to cover the whole body from head to foot except her hands, which wringing with a bunch of it retain'd in them, &s;he &s;uddenly will convert into a <HI>ramol</HI> to ab&s;orb the tears dropping from her eyes. When exa&s;perated by the perfidy or frowns of a lover, the veil, by the irritated dame who wears it, will be di&s;tended, then twi&s;ted fir&s;t one way and then another, and the ends converted into ta&s;&s;els to beat time to the &s;ighs and &s;obs intervening her ejacula|tions. When overjoyed at the unexpected &s;ight of a long ab&s;ented friend, parent, hu&s;band or lover, (con|tracted to in marriage perhaps, and given over for lo&s;t) the veil then, like wings, will be expanded at the full extent of the hands and arms, whil&s;t the enraptured female with rapidity and obvious &s;olici|tude, will fly to the embraces of the welcome and unexpected gue&s;t; and if a parent or hu&s;band, fall down at their feet and wipe them therewith. The veil in &s;hort, under all circum&s;tances of the mind or body, whether fortuitous or premeditated, exigent or voluntary, comes of u&s;e in cour&s;e; and without

it, with &s;atisfaction and decorum, nothing trivial or important can be effected. I have de&s;cribed in my letter, No. 2, to your neighbour Loui&s;a ******, the necklaces, bracelets and annulets they wear on their wri&s;ts and ancles; which but differ more or le&s;s from each other in mode or value, in proportion to the circum&s;tances and ta&s;te of the women who wear them; which rings, &amp;c. except the thumb ring wore by women of all degrees in Indo&s;tan, are all the trinkets that at pre&s;ent occur to me, belong|ing to them. The thumb ring is about the &s;ize of a common &s;ignet, of the diameter of a quarter of a dollar, and worn on the right thumb; the &s;urface of it is a bright &s;peculum of plain poli&s;hed &s;teel, or a bit of good looking-gla&s;s, &s;et in a &s;ocket of gold, environed with little gems. They are cut out into ovals, perfect circles, or polygons, at the plea&s;ure of the gold&s;mith or female it is intended for. This little mirror &s;erves the women to adju&s;t their hair by, pencil their eye-brows, accommodate to their fancy their veils, or contemplate their faces in, and an&s;|wers the purpo&s;e both of portable mirrors and orna|ments. There remains nothing now but the &s;a&s;h and the &s;lippers to compleat the inventory of the decorations and dre&s;s of an Indo&s;tan female: The &s;a&s;h differs in nothing from the veil but in colour, (which is always by way of contra&s;t different) and in dimen&s;ions, it being in general about one third le&s;s than the veil. The&s;e &s;a&s;hes they wear partly round their wai&s;ts and partly round their bodies, as fancy or chance at times decides, with frequently one end of them circumflected round an arm, whil&s;t the other end carele&s;sly playing about will reach down to the bottom of their <HI>pizwawgees,</HI> and fall in with the border before or behind. Their &s;lippers are either &s;ilk, velvet or red leather, and ornamented with &s;pangles, and often with gems. They likewi&s;e

[See in glo&s;&s;ary further de&s;cribed.]</P>
<P>In this manner do the women in Indo&s;tan dre&s;s and adorn them&s;elves, with little if any variation in tho&s;e particulars, except in the different degrees of magnificence of their cloathing and intrin&s;ic value of the auxiliary decorations.</P>

<P>The per&s;ons among the dancing girls who were fixed upon to repre&s;ent the characters in the drama, we may &s;uppo&s;e a long while prepared before hand, and exerci&s;ed in the like performances by &s;uch fre|quent repre&s;entations, mu&s;t have got their particular parts well off by heart, and be &s;ufficiently adequate to the ta&s;k. The parts of Mawtab and Sittarradar were to be acted by two young beautiful girls, who&s;e real names taken from hi&s;tory happened to be the &s;ame as tho&s;e of the per&s;onages they were going to repre&s;ent: the&s;e girls moreover happening to be maidens, and as females in Indo&s;tan during the &s;tate of virginity are particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed and more than ordinary attended to during that &s;tate, before I proceed any further I will give you an account of them.&mdash;A girl that is a maiden never wears a pink or &s;carlet <HI>pizwage</HI> or &s;kirt, except it is on the day of her wedding, when her friends if they think pro|per may inve&s;t her with this mark of di&s;tinction; and as an important indication of virginity the pearl that is wore in common and &s;u&s;pended by a little ring reeved through the middle &s;nip of the no&s;e and ad|mits
<PB N="31" REF="022380_0053_0FB859CA529F3A28">
the pearl down to the top of the upper lip, has during her virginity no collateral jems on each &s;ide like the middle pearls wore by the re&s;t of her &s;ex who have been joined in hymeneal bands, as an undeni|able mark of innocence and purity, nothing but the bare pearl drop on her lip appearing till after con|&s;ummation in marriage; and being in general the younge&s;t of the females in a family, a greater atten|tion is paid to her by her connections, and more means u&s;ed to improve as well as amu&s;e her, particu|larly among&s;t the dancing girls, when a <HI>cheerabund,</HI> as the flower of the flock and favorite of the com|pany or &s;et &s;he belongs to, being on account of her youth the be&s;t calculated to plea&s;e, no pains are &s;pa|red to render her equally attractive in other re&s;pects by an extraordinary attention paid to the decora|tions of her per&s;on, that her &s;uperficial ornaments added to her natural charms and acquired accom|pli&s;hments, &s;he may by being exhibited in the mo&s;t advantageous point of view the more readily attract the eye of a <HI>Shazahdah;</HI> a <HI>Soubah,</HI> or opulent <HI>Rajah,</HI> or a rich young libertine among&s;t the Engli&s;h or French <HI>Toppe-wallas</HI> in their &s;ettlements at a notch, and by making a &s;ignal conque&s;t of a man of fortune &s;ecure to her&s;elf and her friends a capital &s;um of <HI>rupees,</HI> with rich pre&s;ents from the fa&s;cinated <HI>Syab,</HI> whom &s;he has allured with her charms on taking leave; be&s;towed as an equivalent for the favors con|&s;erved and the &s;acrifice &s;he has made of her charms to the lofty <HI>borrah Syab</HI> or pompous a&s;iatic lord. The two per&s;ons pointed out to repre&s;ent the two prince&s;&s;es, I have noticed; which with a &s;pirited young female who was pitched upon to act the part of Zemroode, and two per&s;onable grown women larger than the re&s;t, to do that of Shajahan, the Emperor and the Prie&s;t with two tall palled looking girls who were at hand to act the parts of the eu|nuchs,

<P>The&s;e leading characters dre&s;&s;ed in a more con|&s;picuous manner than the re&s;t of their comrades, to &s;uit the occa&s;ion, advanced in front forming three <HI>Typhas,</HI> with Mawtab in the centre of the fir&s;t, Sat|tarradar in the centre of the &s;econd, and Zemroode in the like po&s;ition with re&s;pect to the third, when the opera opened, and was conducted in the follow|ing manner,&mdash;the <HI>Typhas</HI> thus in readine&s;s, on the entrance of about ten <HI>Mo&s;&s;olljees</HI> with their lighted <HI>mo&s;&s;alls</HI> blazing in their hands, (which are flambeaux u&s;ed all over India) fixed in bra&s;s handles, they al|tered their <HI>Typhas,</HI> and Mawtab between Settarra|dar and Zemroode, in trio, &s;ang a &s;ong, the tune of which re&s;embled in &s;ome mea&s;ure the tune of 'Wa|ter parted from the &s;ea,' &amp;c.&mdash;This was accompa|nied by the <HI>Serindas, Tomtoms,</HI> and <HI>Beringealls;</HI> in the cour&s;e of which &s;cene the abu&s;ed Prince&s;&s;es would interchange frowns and &s;miles in different ca|dence, ri&s;e and fall their voices, and modulate them to the different keys or pitch of the in&s;truments of the band then playing, and to the mea&s;ure of the tune in hand; which artfully adapted to the &s;en&s;e of the words, being <HI>alto</HI> and <HI>forti&s;&s;imo,</HI> where com|plaints &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed in rage, and <HI>moderato adagio</HI> or <HI>piano,</HI> in le&s;s irritable altercations when the dialogue was cheerful, &amp;c. &amp;c.

perform before, would imagine they had thrown them&s;elves into convul&s;ive fits; and the &s;ame with the others in the different departments of their bu&s;i|ne&s;s. The <HI>Tomtoms</HI> and <HI>Beringealls</HI> being on oppo|&s;ite &s;ides of the place, emulated in endeavouring to outdo each other in a variety of odd po&s;itions they put their bodies in, and as uncommon ge&s;ticulations they made with their limbs, and grimaces with their faces, by various aggravations of the features, and confronting each other like combattants who had entered the li&s;ts to decide &s;ome warlike di&s;pute, would begin the conte&s;t by mutual nodding, wink|ing and beckoning acro&s;s the &s;aloon; after which the <HI>Tomtoms</HI> perhaps leading the van for the then pre&s;ent, would with fingers and thumbs (for tho&s;e are all the implements they have to extort &s;ounds out of the in&s;truments with) in order to &s;ucceed without failing in the part they were playing at that particular juncture, &s;hrink their heads to &s;uch a degree into the hollow formed, by &s;hrugging up of the &s;houlders at the &s;ame time, in order to facilitate and humor the ratling the reville&egrave; they were beat|ing with their fingers on their hollow in&s;truments or <HI>Tomtoms,</HI> while the <HI>Beringealls</HI> not idle on their part, and equally ambitious to demon&s;trate their abilities, would draw up their mouths, grin and bite their lips, &s;tare the oppo&s;ite <HI>Tomtoms</HI> full in the face, then gra&s;ping their <HI>Berringealls,</HI> menace with them, &s;eemingly, the <HI>Tomtoms;</HI> and continue this &s;port for &s;ome time in the following manner: the Serin|dawallas now conjoin both timbrels together, clap them in that po&s;ition to one ear, and with incredi|ble rapidity and violence ding for half a minute or &s;o, then rattle them over their heads, or with le&s;s violence when any &s;oft tender air was playing, gently &s;ound them within a re&s;pectful di&s;tance of the Prin|ce&s;&s;es ears; and on a tran&s;ition of the tune from
<PB N="34" REF="022380_0056_0FB859D2FA858970">
<HI>piano</HI> to <HI>forti&s;&s;imo,</HI> from that po&s;ition that was partly erect, &s;uddenly bending their bodies downwards with their fi&s;ts employed as before, as &s;uddenly &s;weep the &s;urface of the carpet on which they were &s;tanding, and looking eagerly at the performers in the face, however unea&s;y the po&s;ture they might be in by the unnatural curvature of their necks; whil&s;t the ac|tre&s;&s;es on their part ob&s;erving carefully their quee throughout the different &s;cenes of action, accompa|nied this vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic with as great a variety of agreeable alterations in the di&s;po&s;ition of their robes and the inclination of their heads and elegant po&s;itions of their feet and hands and arms; while the veils all this time, like different coloured en&s;igns and pendants waving about &s;hips &s;terns and ma&s;t-heads in light intermitting breezes, circum|volving round the&s;e brilliant a&s;iatic actre&s;&s;es in in|numerable gyrations, heightened the complexion of the entertainment, and obliged the company to con|cur that it tran&s;cended any theatrical performance they ever &s;aw exhibited in Europe. Thus did they proceed, enveloping and developing them&s;elves with their veils; &s;ometimes exhibiting to full view their whole per&s;ons from top to toe, at others affording but as tran&s;ient a glimp&s;e thereof, whil&s;t in a per|petual motion of their bodies and limbs, without jumping up or down or beating time with their heels, or cro&s;&s;ing over and figuring in, as is done in hornpipes, jiggs, &amp;c. among&s;t us, which they would e&s;teem rude in a female to pretend to attempt; they went through the innumerable evolutions of the dance, to the end of the piece. This may convey to you a tolerable good idea of what is called in Indo&s;tan a <HI>notch;</HI> there remains now but to determine what name, with propriety, might be given to this a&s;iatic entertainment, in Engli&s;h. In treating of it all along, I have occa&s;ionally called it an opera, a
<PB N="35" REF="022380_0057_0FB859D523CF57D8">
dance, or a dramatic performance, which latter in|cludes all productions of the drama whatever, and a name general to all theatrical productions, I thought with great propriety might be applied to a <HI>notch:</HI> they have all the properties of a dramatic piece, viz. an hi&s;tory, with an epi&s;ode, a plot, and a counter-plot, which are well wound up and con|cealed, and the characters as well &s;upported and contrived, replete with variety and incidndence; and the laws of time, place and action, as minutely ob&s;erved, ina&s;much that were the&s;e pieces to be acted in one of the Theatres in London, by his Maje&s;ty's comedians, they would meet with as general ap|plau&s;e as any opera that ever was acted; which lat|ter &s;pecies of writing I think they &s;hould be cla&s;&s;ed among&s;t; but this di&s;advantage the&s;e operas labour under in Indo&s;tan, where no man cannot even as much as ride out in the &s;ame carriage with a female, or &s;it near her in public, without becoming an ob|ject of ridicule, it would be ab&s;urdity then to the la&s;t degree, and a &s;ubject of admiration and con|tempt, to &s;ee men and women indi&s;criminately mixed together on an occa&s;ion like the one I am alluding to; but for a man to offer to ki&s;s a lady's lips be|fore a company, or take her in his arms, would be an offence that could not be pardoned, and con&s;e|quently inadmi&s;&s;able in Indo&s;tan; which will &s;uffi|ciently account for the women acting the part of men on the&s;e occa&s;ions, and the rea&s;on they have not public Theatres on purpo&s;e for exhibitions of this nature is as plain. The natives of Indo&s;tan fond of permanent things, and holding all &s;cenery and picture&s;que repre&s;entations of palaces and groves as puerile and tawdry, prefer carrying on their country di&s;&s;ipations in actual Saloons covered with rich Per&s;ian carpets; and &s;uperb Varandos, and na|tural augu&s;t groves formed by nature, with &s;ome

<P>I Have now been in the country a con&s;iderable time, and a long intercour&s;e with the natives, ad|ded to the knowledge I have acquired of the lan|guage, enables me to judge for my&s;elf in matters I was before obliged to be guided by others in: I can maintain a conver&s;ation with any people I have bu&s;ine&s;s with, dictate a letter, or li&s;ten to a hi&s;tory while reading to me, without being at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand its meaning; and it being a fine evening, I have been &s;olacing my&s;elf in the varando of Pla&s;&s;ey garden-hou&s;e, and &s;atisfying my curio&s;ity in vi&s;iting the particular &s;pots on the&s;e plains that Pla&s;&s;ey gives name to, that have became the mo&s;t remarkable and in a manner eminent for &s;ome important incident at the battle that was fought on them by major Clive, when he engaged the <HI>Soubah Serujahdowlah,</HI> where, after compleatly defeating him, this unhappy Prince in his flight fell a victim to the private re|&s;entment of a fellow of low &s;tamp, who for theft &s;ome time before, had his ears cropt by order of his highne&s;s.

On the eve of my departure from Fort-William, be|ing employed to a&s;&s;i&s;t in a branch of a &s;urvey that was to be made in the province of Dacca and Chit|tagan, which latter place is at the bottom of the bay of Bengal, I was furni&s;hed with a <HI>Budgero,</HI> or rather allowed the hire of one I had bought a little before, a large <HI>Dinghy,</HI> with two cook-boats to carry and to dre&s;s the victuals in, and cook in be&s;ides when we &s;hould not make fa&s;t at &s;ome <HI>Gott,</HI> or run up &s;ome creek in the evenings, as is cu&s;tomary, with a little boat to pa&s;s and repa&s;s from the &s;hore to the larger boats.

Figure to your&s;elf a large river, bounded by a flat &s;andy beach, with a bank of tough earth and clay cut through with gutters running in an oblique di|rection to the front, made by the de&s;cent of the wa|ters during the rains, at a di&s;tance &s;ufficient to admit two or three carriages driving abrea&s;t between it and

the &s;tream, and you will have a tolerable good idea of the &s;ide of the river. The country, which is in general level from Calcutta to Muxadabads, runs back in plains to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance till it meets the Burampore hills, and others that divide it from the &s;outhern provinces and the Decan, which inter|&s;per&s;ed with little groves and lone trees here and there in the mid&s;t of fields and verdant plains, gives it a rural and plea&s;ing pro&s;pect. The&s;e lands are of a rich &s;oil, and favorable to the production of grain or vegetables, and the trees in general are as friendly in bearing variety of fruits.</P>
<P>The groves I mentioned are of the utmo&s;t utility to the country and its inhabitants;&mdash;in them the Mahometans and <HI>Gentoos</HI> have their places of wor|&s;hip, Mo&s;ques and <HI>Pagodas,</HI> public Bagnios and wells, or re&s;ervoirs of water. If a Mo&s;que, and &s;ituate in one of the&s;e groves, a <HI>Fakir</HI> or a <HI>Peerza|dah</HI> will have his abode there, and &s;ometimes &s;ix or &s;even others of the &s;ame denomination with him, con&s;tant re&s;idents, and perhaps proprietors by inhe|ritance or by purcha&s;e; Mahometans and Gentoos both frequently buying of the <HI>Sircar</HI> di&s;tricts for an abode during life or plea&s;ure, in one of the&s;e &s;hady, &s;olitary or frequented &s;pots. If the grove is occupied by a <HI>Gentoo Fakir,</HI> a Bramin or Byrahghy, it is as likely he may be accompanied by &s;ome of his &s;ect as not, but &s;eldom or ever a Fakir, whether Gentoo or Mahometan, is without a man or a boy to keep his company and attend him.

I quit my Budgero, and with my <HI>Banyan</HI> and <HI>Mun&s;y,</HI> made a little incur&s;ion from the place we landed at, ordering the boats to pro|ceed up to Hugly, and directed our &s;teps towards this Indian temple, It &s;tood in the middle of a large grove of mangoe trees, the fruit of which being ripe, and &s;ome of them pre&s;ented us by a Bramin, atten|dant on this building, we ate of them and I thought it delicious fruit. An avenue cut thro' this grove lead up to the front of the Pagoda, a very lofty pile, and of &s;ome con&s;iderable magnitude. It &s;tood on an oblong platform of bricks, with a revetement of fine white <HI>Chunnan</HI> about &s;ix feet ro&s;e from the &s;ur|face of a large e&s;planade pavement, compo&s;ed of the &s;ame materials, that extended every way about forty yards from this platform. On the platform, which I take to have been thirty yards by &s;ixty, was erected the temple, con&s;i&s;ting of one compleat &s;quare, and a lofty hall in the mid&s;t, included within four larger exterior apartments that had all arched entrances at right angles, with little columns at their gate-ways or entrances, who&s;e pede&s;tals were demi-urns cut through the conjugate diameter of their out-lines, and inverted, which met pine apples rector on the top, from the ba&s;es of which ran dimini&s;hing regular|ly upwards, fluted columns that met capitals corre&s;|ponding with whole pines above, with a corni&s;h that in the larger columns went round the building both

<P>THE &s;pectators more u&s;ed to the&s;e &s;ights than my&s;elf, formed, I di&s;covered earne&s;t and different ideas of the determination of the battle, and laid wagers accordingly: two parties &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, one in favour of the Aurangabad elephant, and one in fa|vour of the Gorackpore elephant; two places who&s;e vicinities are famous for good elephants. The Go|rackpore elephant was a &s;ize &s;maller than the other, but &s;eemed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with more activity though le&s;s craft, and the expectations of the crowd were rai&s;ed to a con&s;iderable pitch when the attack began, in the manner following:</P>
<P>The larger elephant being on the level of the plain, while the &s;maller one was on the declevity of an hillock, the big elephant ran one of his fangs in|to his mouth, that in the pu&s;h pa&s;&s;ed through the fle&s;hy part of his cheek under the ear, and hooking him at the &s;ame time with the other tu&s;k under one of his hams, got him&s;elf &s;o entangled that notwith|&s;tanding his repeated endeavours to over&s;et him, he failed in his attempt; when the other elephant tak|ing the advantage of a &s;tumble his opponent made with one of his fore feet (that buried it&s;elf up to the middle of the leg in a &s;and hole) expeditiou&s;ly ran him through the gullet with one of his tu&s;ks, and &s;et him in a gore of blood. All this while their trunks, like two ropes, were twi&s;ted in one, and thus entangled together they &s;ee&s;awed backwards and forward for the &s;pace of about five minutes, beweltered in blood, and their eyes &s;welled with the di&s;tention of their trunks, and the agony it put them in, to &s;uch a degree they appeared as though they would bur&s;t in their heads; while their &s;trength and &s;pirits wa&s;ted with fatigue, the pain of their wounds

and the great lo&s;s of blood they had &s;u&s;tained, they &s;tood &s;tock &s;till for perhaps another five minutes, panting and puffing, and blowing &s;o loud that the &s;ound of their re&s;piration was di&s;tingui&s;hable amid&s;t even the din and clamour of the &s;urrounding popu|lace; notwith&s;tanding which enfeebled &s;tate, they vigorou&s;ly maintained their hold, in order, appa|rently, to recruit their wind and &s;pirits, that they might be the better enabled to begin the combat anew; while at intervals the drivers calling out to their elephants aloud by their re&s;pective names, to hold out to the la&s;t, and never yield while there was breath in their body, for the honor of their illu&s;tri|ous ma&s;ter the <HI>Souhah,</HI> and his &s;ubjects the &s;pecta|tors, both drivers, laterly with their <HI>punjahs</HI> prick|ing the heads of their re&s;pective elephants (already like honeycomb with the holes that had been made in them in the cour&s;e of the action by the&s;e wea|pons) both unable to bear the repeated &s;tabs of the <HI>punjahs,</HI> and the excrutiating pain they indured by this rude circumplication of each others trunks, after making two-mo&s;t hedious roars, with obvious repugnance let go each others trunks, and after|wards with as great a reluctance withdrew their for|midable fangs from the bloody inci&s;&s;ions they had made in each others bodies (hitching back at the &s;ame time, and watching each others motions with unremitted attention) when the rider of the &s;maller elephant urging his bea&s;t to the charge again, they both by this time being reinforced with wind and &s;pirits, he advanced with tolerable celerity towards his antagoni&s;t, who in&s;tead of facing him, turned from him and ran as hard as he could drive towards that part of the plain that was barrier'd by the con|cour&s;e of the people above mentioned, and getting among&s;t the thick of them before they could get out of his way, both men and hor&s;es he &s;cooped up

<P>LADIES, I have been de&s;cribing to Mr. Chap|man, the diver&s;ions I was witne&s;s to ye&s;terday fore|noon, which letters there is no doubt but you have &s;een and will impart to tho&s;e of your acquaintance, with whom I corre&s;pond.</P>
<P>The heat of the day coming on the <HI>Soubah</HI> retired within the walls of his palace, and the &s;pectators withdrew to their re&s;pective homes, who&s;e example I followed by going to my friend's at Moradbaugh, an Engli&s;h captain, commanding two battalions of Seapoys in this department. This gentleman had been &s;ome years in the country, &s;poke the Indo&s;tan language perfectly well, and was even a critic in it; and initiated along while into the ways of the natives, whether Gentoos or Mahometans; likewi&s;e of a &s;a|tirical turn, and a young fellow of excellent wit and

fini&s;hed education, proved an agreeable companion, and was, during my &s;tay at Muxadabads of great &s;ervice to me, in his informations re&s;pecting the country.</P>
<P>In the cool of the evening we returned to the place of action, in a few minutes after which the Nabob, with his vi&s;iters and aumeers, appeared again in the &s;ame balcony they did in the morning, on which a rhinoceros, and an elephant prepared for battle, were brought forth, who on the &s;ight of each other, in|&s;tantly approaching, begun with the utmo&s;t fury to engage. The elephant, at the fir&s;t on&s;et, over&s;etting the rhinoceros in &s;cringing back to get &s;ufficient play for his teeth, which were at lea&s;t between eight and nine feet long, he being a very large elephant, and upwards of ten feet in height, and proportion|ably &s;trong and robu&s;t, and in appearance double the magnitude of his foe, but failing in his attempt by only helping the unweildly animal up by lifting him bodily with his teeth, that he ran compleatly under him, in&s;tead of through his vitals as he intended; the recovered brute, with all his might, ru&s;hing his head under the elephant's belly, in order to rip it open with the horn that projected out from his fore|head (which is always the rhinoceros's play when engaging his common enemy the elephant) he con|tinued poking at his antogoni&s;t's guts, having got at la&s;t both his head and &s;houlders between the ele|phant's hind legs, which being out of the reach of the elephant's teeth, giving him pain without his being able to di&s;engage him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Provoked with his &s;ituation, he gave three &s;udden &s;ucce&s;&s;ive roars, followed by a violent jerk of his whole body backwards, which bringing the rhinoceros in front, with an incredible rapid pu&s;h of one of his teeth, he maimed him to &s;uch a degree, that unable to continue longer the fight, he turned tail and
<PB N="71" REF="022380_0093_0FB85A1FE5F456D0">
marched off, and left him ma&s;ter of the field, amid&s;t the &s;houts and acclamations of the crowd; when he was conducted by an e&s;cort in the &s;ame manner the conquering elephant had been in the forenoon to &s;a|lute the Soubah his &s;overeign lord and ma&s;ter. The rhinoceros I have been treating of, though de&s;cribed in the encyclopedia, and by writers of natural hi&s;|tory, as an animal not &s;o generally known as many others of a le&s;s note, I will, before I proceed in my account of the diver&s;ions I have promi&s;ed in my let|ters, &s;ay &s;omething about this creature. The head of a rhinoceros has re&s;emblance to both a camel's and a boar's, and &s;o thick the bone of his &s;cull that it will repel a mu&s;ket ball, or the blow of an ax; but di&s;|proportionate to his body, which with his legs and thighs re&s;emble much an elephant's: upon his fore|head grows a horn, turning inwards towards his ears, to which his forehead is a ba&s;e, this horn being about &s;ix inches in diameter below that part of it that coheres to his face, and &s;even inches in length, ter|minating gradually from the ba&s;e to a point; which horn though not very large is very &s;olid and &s;tubborn and is the only weapon he has to tru&s;t to for offence or defence, except his hide, which is a compleat coat of mail, nature having provided this animal with, above all others known in the creation, the mo&s;t redoubtable barriers again&s;t the mi&s;&s;ive weapons of men, or the formidable talons and voracious jaws of other bea&s;ts, an hard knobby cru&s;t of ramifica|tions and thick impenetrable &s;cales covering the &s;u|perfices of his hide, excepting his belly and lower parts, that, though retained within a &s;kin of an inch thick, and of a more glutinous and ela&s;tic nature than that of even a buffaloe's, lies expo&s;ed to the wound of &s;hot and pointed weapons. His food is ve|getable, and when kept up a while, he will grow do|cile and pacific; and his horn is &s;aid to be &s;o certain

an antidote, that liquor even drank out of it, though mixed with poi&s;on, will have no fatal effects.</P>
<P>After this engagement, I ob&s;erved the multitude &s;uddenly broke the line they had formed on the &s;outh &s;ide of the plain, and were contending who &s;hould gain the banks of the river fir&s;t, till by degrees thou&s;ands of &s;pectators a&s;&s;embled on both &s;ides. The ladies of the &s;eraglio had been taking a party of plea&s;ure on the water, and were then returning in their <HI>Bud|geroes.</HI> A fleet of the&s;e Budgeroes, or Indian barges with about three hundred boats of different &s;izes and con&s;truction, appeared on the river winding into that branch of it that ran between Muxadabads and the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, that I among&s;t the re&s;t of the&s;e &s;pectators &s;tood on. The&s;e boats formed a three di&s;tinct divi&s;ions, viz.&mdash;front, centre and rear. In the centre of each divi&s;ion was a large <HI>Budgero,</HI> commanding the re&s;t, and in the centre of the middle divi&s;ion, &s;even of greater magnitude, the middle of which was at lea&s;t as big again as the <HI>Budgeroes</HI> in general among&s;t the whole. The le&s;&s;er boats were painted <HI>Dinghees</HI> and <HI>Moor Punkies</HI> with little <HI>Ki&s;ties</HI> attending them, and rowing a-head at times, and then dropping a-&s;tern, according to the &s;ignals given from the re&s;t of the fleet, which &s;ignals were made by the firing of &s;mall bra&s;s cannon from the large <HI>Budgeroes,</HI> and waving particular flags, and from the <HI>Dinghees</HI> and <HI>Moor Punkies</HI> by di&s;|charging &s;everal guns or large <HI>Burghunda&s;&s;es.</HI> In this order divided, they advanced down the river, but the current running again&s;t them, which was pretty &s;trong, the progre&s;s they made was but &s;low, whil&s;t the wind, being contrary, likewi&s;e which prevented their carrying &s;ails; it gave good opportunity for examining the form of the boats, the dre&s;s of the people that managed them, and their mode of con|ducting them. The <HI>Budgeroes</HI> were all painted and
<PB N="73" REF="022380_0095_0FB85A23760C3A38">
gilded, and decorated with carved work heads and &s;terns, with elegant varandos to them, &s;creened by &s;ilk and &s;attin, venetian blinds, and windows of flow|ered gla&s;s to the apartments of the <HI>Budgeroes,</HI> that the ladies within &s;ide might &s;ee without being &s;een. The tops of the <HI>Budgeroes</HI> were all covered with &s;carlet broad cloth, and fringed with gold, and wai&s;t cloths and quarter cloths of the &s;ame. The oars were painted red, and the <HI>Manjies</HI> and <HI>Dandies</HI> were all dre&s;&s;ed in &s;carlet cloth coats with narrow &s;leeves, and long trow&s;ers of the &s;ame, but different coloured, &s;a&s;hes and turbans, with gold borders and fringes to them, which variety and contra&s;t in the&s;e parts of their dre&s;s had the more plea&s;ing effect. In this manner were the crews of the <HI>Budgeroes, Dinghies</HI> and <HI>Ki&s;ties</HI> dre&s;&s;ed, throughout every &s;quadron, but the <HI>Manjies</HI> and <HI>Dandies</HI> of the <HI>Moor Punkies,</HI> wore a different garb, and additional ornaments, having all &s;carlet <HI>Jammers</HI> of &s;tout linen, and turbans and &s;a&s;hes of the &s;ame, who&s;e extraordinary bu&s;ine&s;&s;es were to beat time to bands of mu&s;ic the&s;e boats were all furni&s;hed with.&mdash;They had appen|dages to their dre&s;s to an&s;wer that purpo&s;e, having bells fa&s;tened by bandages round their arms and wri&s;ts, likewi&s;e acro&s;s their bodies and round their wai&s;ts, hanging bells in the form of tho&s;e that are in &s;teeples, and others ca&s;t like tho&s;e that are hung round the necks of &s;lay hor&s;es in America, or car|riers hor&s;es in Europe. The bandages the&s;e bells were tacked to were from two to three inches wide, and had tufts of black &s;ilk &s;ewed to them, with thick bunches of black hor&s;e hair fixed in &s;ilver &s;ockets to their wri&s;ts and elbows, and each <HI>Manjy</HI> and <HI>Dandy,</HI> an ornament of the &s;ame kind hanging to the back part of his turban.</P>
<P>The large&s;t of the <HI>Budgeroes</HI> that was in the centre of the fleet was called the Sultana, on board of which
<PB N="74" REF="022380_0096_0FB85A2514E7E5F0">
was the <HI>Beagum</HI> or queen, and the others were named in general after ladies in the &s;eraglio;&mdash;&s;he had twenty-four <HI>Dandies</HI> on a &s;ide to row her along, making forty-eight in all, with a fore-ca&s;tle that was about twelve feet in length, and a cabbin or ac|commodations abaft, that reached from the after oar to the &s;tem, at lea&s;t thirty feet, making the Budgero in all about ninety feet long; on her poop or top of the cabbin were &s;eated guards of <HI>Seapoys, Peuns,</HI> and <HI>Harkarars,</HI> all hand&s;omely dre&s;&s;ed, and officers of tru&s;t, with a number of female Arabs, (women in the capacity of menial &s;ervants) were &s;een going in and out of the Varando of the <HI>Budgero;</HI> likewi&s;e eunuchs, young and old, &s;uperbly dre&s;&s;ed and armed, a large band of mu&s;ic was on the fore-ca&s;tle, and a quantity of mu&s;icians, more or le&s;s in every boat, and <HI>Moor Punky</HI> in the fleet. The colours that were flying on board the Sultana, were a large &s;carlet &s;ilk en&s;ign fa&s;tened to the toping-lift of the main-boom, (as &s;he was rigged &s;loop fa&s;hion) and in form of the &s;ection of a cone, &s;nipt at the vertical point, that formed two ends, with a pair of black &s;heers in the centre: with a large long pendant, that extended by the breeze of wind that was &s;tiff, ran beyond the taffel of the Budgero that was in a right line with the Sultana a &s;tern, with &s;maller pendants fa&s;tened to the &s;ame flag-&s;taff, in the &s;hape of &s;wallows tails, and a large flag on a &s;taff, fixed on the bow&s;prit, be|&s;ides &s;everal en&s;igns of different colours. Men and boys carried others, fa&s;tened to painted and gilded &s;taffs. The other <HI>Budgeroes</HI> of the fleet were all in the &s;ame &s;tyle that the <HI>Sultana</HI>'s was. The <HI>Dinghies</HI> were open boats painted, and their heads, &s;terns and wai&s;ts, covered with cloths of different colours, and filled with people differently dre&s;&s;ed; the&s;e boats belonging to individuals among&s;t the inhabitants who had accompanied this fleet in order to take
<PB N="75" REF="022380_0097_0FB85A26CB9F7AA8">
their plea&s;ure had joined in with this fleet, but each boat had at lea&s;t a mu&s;ician on board, and &s;ome two or three, and &s;ome a whole band; the boats being near two hundred in all, formed at lea&s;t two-thirds of the fleet. The <HI>Moor Punkies,</HI> of which there might be fifty of different &s;izes, were &s;ome five or &s;ix of them 70 feet in length, made like petiauguas, but with high poops and little top-gallant decks or fore-ca&s;tles and prows, &s;ome of them carrying thirty or forty <HI>Dandies.</HI> The&s;e petiauguas or <HI>Punkies</HI> were rowed with paddles (not oars) which were neatly made, about five feet &s;ix inches long, with blades to them about eight inches wide, and made upon the whole exactly like a &s;patula.

The whole palace was illuminated within &s;ide and without with gilded and painted candles and lamps, that were placed &s;o thick that the windows, niches, and arches of the building, were in a manner cover|ed with them; be&s;ides a number of gla&s;s and i&s;ingla&s;s lanthorns, of various colours and &s;izes, and of as many different forms; &s;ome repre&s;enting Pagodas, and others barges, &s;u&s;pending in the air, with can|dles and lamps burning; both without &s;ide and within a number of trophies, en&s;igns and pendants, and em|broidered cloths and velvets were &s;pread at intervals over the ballu&s;trades; and in the front of the balco|nies of all the different galleries, up to the battle|ments of the building, which was lined with &s;pectators.

<P>The&s;e princely matters all in readine&s;s, the <HI>Sou|bah</HI>'s arrival was announced aloud by the <HI>Chubdars</HI> and eunuchs, who advancing in the front of the Va|rando, accompanied by his <HI>Omrahs</HI> and <HI>Aumeers,</HI> &s;eated him&s;elf on the <HI>Mu&s;nud,</HI> and received the com|pliments of the &s;pectators in general, and returned the &s;ame by putting his hand to his head, when the <HI>Peerzadas</HI> calling out, <HI>Dowlat Zadah Bahadar Gee|teeo!</HI> that is, Long live and pro&s;per!

<P>IN my letter, No. 6, in treating of the dancing girls, I declined, including in a de&s;cription of them, the women in general of the country, from a defer|ence I wi&s;hed to &s;hew women of other &s;tamp, on the one hand, and from my want of a &s;ufficient know|ledge of the Indo&s;tan females in general on the other, &s;ince the writing of which letter my experience in the country has enabled me to form a tolerable good idea of the temper, character and manners of it's inhabitants, and particularly of the females, oppor|tunities that have been afforded me and very lately of becoming acquainted with the dome&s;tic oeconomy of women of the fir&s;t &s;tamp, having &s;upplied me with materials enough, not only to fill up a letter, but a little volume on the occa&s;ion, I &s;hall venture upon a general de&s;cription, however conci&s;e, of their per&s;ons, morals and manners.

<P>With re&s;pect to their per&s;ons, the unwearied at|tention they pay to them, and indefatigable pains that are taken by them to keep them clean (parti|cularly among women of rank) is &s;o unparalleled that, in the eyes of any other nation than them|&s;elves, or people who had re&s;ided among&s;t them, however expedient the mode, and indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary, it would appear as ridiculous as u&s;ele&s;s, an appropriation of time, and as undeniable a conta|mination of it, notwith&s;tanding not only the pre|cepts of their religion, independent of the invaria|ble cu&s;tom of the country; their invincible de&s;ire to render them&s;elves agreeable to their connections, whether feminine or ma&s;culine, and if married, to plea&s;e their partners to whom they are inviolably attached, and owe implicit obedience; their &s;itua|tion with re&s;pect to latitude, and a combination of other mental and local con&s;iderations, as evident to them&s;elves as indi&s;tingui&s;hable to others, in a cli|mate like the one alluded to, where the inten&s;e heat of the &s;un that keeps both the rational and animal part of the creation in a &s;tate of fumigation and per&s;piration, which calls upon all the precautions prudence can dictate for the pre&s;ervation of health;

He was copper-coloured, had a black &s;parkling eye, and was a native of I&s;pahan, and from his infancy, intimate with Thomas Koulikan, afterwards &s;tyled-Nadir Shaw, following the for|tunes of this eminent warrior, became one of his principal confidents and leading officers: but on Nadir Shaw's being killed, retreating with his fa|mily and a body of hor&s;e to Indo&s;tan; to &s;trengthen his intere&s;t, he married one of his daughters to the Vizier, who retained him in his &s;ervice, and ad|vanced him and his followers. He was &s;eated on a carpet leaning again&s;t a large cu&s;hion, in a circle of Mogul officers who lined the apartment.</P>
<P>The&s;e Moguls had a fierce look methought, which their ruddy complexions, bu&s;hy beards, &s;harp white teeth, fiery eyes, and big turbans, did not a little contribute to any more than their arms and dre&s;s; they wearing all high cylindrical caps within their turbans, exactly in the proportion and form of an high crowned hat of different coloured velvets, &s;at|tins, broad-cloths and <HI>kincobs,</HI> and traver&s;ed round with &s;hawls, or &s;ome beautiful manufacture, and tied over all with a <HI>ramol</HI> to keep them &s;nug, and from falling off when on hor&s;eback.

which differ in no wi&s;e from women's &s;hifts, having neither collars nor wri&s;t-bands to them. Their boots vary in nothing from European boots but in the heels, which are made exactly like our women's high heeled &s;hoes, and their &s;lippers are made in the &s;ame manner but &s;touter, and are mo&s;tly of vel|vet or cloth, or of red, blue or green leather. The cla&s;ps of their belts, and the hilts of their &s;words, and in &s;hort, all the metal about their arms and mi&s;&s;ive weapons, were in general gold, and &s;tudded with jewels; and upon the whole, they cut as war|like as re&s;pectable an appearance, and being the flower of Nadir Shaw's &s;oldiers, tho' mo&s;t of them advanced to 40 or 50 years of age, and numbers of them upwards of 60 or 70; they neither wanted vigour of body or mind, which were both evident in their looks and actions, having in general a warlike a&s;pect, and had upon the whole, the ap|pearance of men of credit and wealth; they having, mo&s;t of them, more or le&s;s gold in &s;pecie and jewels they had accumulated at different times in battle, and favorites of the Grand Vizer were perpetually employed on lucrative jobbs that added to their wealth; the&s;e men being cuttleba&s;hes, not common hor&s;emen, but even part of the identical body of men who had been employed by Nadir Shah, to exact the contribution of the inhabitants of Delhy and Indo&s;tan, when he invaded the empire.</P>

He was an enterprizing prince, with no bounds to his genero&s;ity, and it appeared to me in a &s;trong light, that could I but get intro|duced into his &s;ervice, I could not fail of an&s;wering his purpo&s;e and making my fortune; but &s;uch im|pediments laid in my way again&s;t accompli&s;hing &s;uch a de&s;ign, that it was evident to me, without uncom|mon luck and &s;ome extraordinary effort of intere&s;t, out of the u&s;ual channel, exerted in my favour, I &s;hould never gain my point.</P>

After they came to an eclairci&s;&s;e|ment he ended his expedition in a drill campain, and his army, artillery, and European detachments have been encrea&s;ing ever &s;ince; from which time, while the Company to prevent any future migrations of Europeans up into the interior parts of the country, have given orders tolet no white men, without their permit, pa&s;s the Choques forts or &s;ettlements, and enacted in council, that any &s;ervant of the Com|pany's who &s;hould pre&s;ume to vi&s;it the <HI>Patcha, Vizier, Soubah,</HI> or any of the country powers, without their leave, he &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their &s;ervice; and if a free merchant, free mariner, or any other adventurer in the country (though not in their &s;ervice) for &s;uch on offence be &s;ent a pri&s;oner to the Pre&s;idency, and as &s;uch conveyed to Europe.

to remove which ob&s;tacles, on my arrival at Ban|germau, it occurred to me that the Fa&s;dar, who &s;aw with an envious eye the growing power of the Com|pany, and had talked loudly of their late imperti|nent behaviour to the Vizier, might po&s;&s;ibly li&s;ten to a prepo&s;ition that had a tendency to the aggran|di&s;ement of his &s;on in law; as my vanity made me pre&s;ume, that the offer of an Engli&s;h <HI>Toppee Wallas</HI>'s &s;ervices (of my con&s;equence) might not be con&s;i|dered as an object of no importance, and flattered with that idea, I determined on explaining my&s;elf to this Mogul of eminence on the occa&s;ion, which, in the interview I had required of him, I did in <HI>earne&s;t</HI> and &s;ufficient terms, that he li&s;tened to with the greate&s;t attention; and though prepared with an an&s;wer, as he afterwards informed me, then told me it was a matter of the utmo&s;t moment, that re|quired &s;ome mature and deliberate con&s;ideration, to which he would attend, and give his opinion of in the evening: in the interim, informing me break|fa&s;t was ready, that had, he added, been retarded upon my account, which he would be glad I would partake of; I accordingly went with him into the apartment adjoining.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t time I ever ate with a Mogul, and as the entertainment was to me new, I will give you an account of it: a large covering was &s;pread in the middle of the apartment, made of camel's leather, neatly &s;ewed together and fringed with the &s;ame, with diaper cloths and beautiful mats above all, to place the di&s;hes on; Madeira and claret wines were then, by order of the <HI>Fa&s;dar,</HI> brought in from my own ca&s;es, for my u&s;e, when after they had &s;eated them&s;elves cro&s;s-legg'd, as u&s;ual, with the <HI>Fa&s;dar</HI> at the head of his company, con&s;i&s;ting of about forty Moguls and others, bread of two diffe|rent kinds was handed round,&mdash;the one &s;ort was
<PB N="109" REF="022380_0131_0FB85A6FE672BA48">
<HI>nonpor</HI> bread, the other <HI>chappaty</HI> bread; the <HI>nonpoy</HI> bread was leavened, and about the &s;ize of thick pan|cakes or &s;lapjacks, and the <HI>chappaty</HI> or unleavened bread, (the dimen&s;ions of a common china plate) made of fiber and water, converted into dough, fa&s;tened out with hands, and afterwards baked on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> or hollow iron uten&s;ils. Their meats were of various kinds, and too tedious to enumerate; however &s;ome of them I will introduce by way of variety; which were their <HI>Pilloes,</HI> &s;aline <HI>Sourrou|adars</HI> and meat <HI>Curryadar.</HI> Their pilloes are their favourite and &s;tanding di&s;hes, and are made of rice and the meat of kid, mutton, antelope, deer or fowls, and cooked much after the manner as in Europe, with this difference, that the flavour of them is not heightened by the addition of ham, which to chri&s;|tians, though &s;o agreeable to Mahomedans, is &s;o obnoxious that what quantity of it would &s;atisfy the appetite of a child among&s;t us, would not only con|taminate the meats of a &s;ingle repa&s;t, but pollute a whole tribe of <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmans</HI> that &s;hould partake of it. The &s;maller di&s;hes were kid, mutton and fowl; fried, boiled and roa&s;ted, and &s;ome of each made into forc'd-meat-balls; with fi&s;h, fle&s;h and fowls dre&s;&s;ed with <HI>Curry&s;tuff</HI> and <HI>Salline Sourrouadar</HI> (of which two la&s;t articles, <HI>See Glo&s;&s;ary</HI> for explication). The pilloes were &s;erved up in di&s;hes of about three feet in diameter; the one of gold, the other two of &s;ilver: the other meats were &s;erved up, &s;ome in thin wooden trenchers, and &s;ome on plates and di&s;hes of china, &s;ilver and gold, of different &s;orts and &s;izes; they prefering this variety, in tho&s;e articles, through|out the country, to that uniformity therein we &s;o much admire. Thus &s;eated, and grace being &s;aid by the <HI>Fa&s;dar,</HI> as head of the family, he began to officiate at table in di&s;tributing the different meats that were before us, which he did with great alacrity

and chearfulne&s;s; and &s;hewing me a deference as a &s;tranger, had the di&s;hes of <HI>Pilloe</HI> handed to him, when taking two of the&s;e large flat <HI>Nonpoys,</HI> above de|&s;cribed, with a proportion of the <HI>Chappaty</HI> bread, clapping both hands fir&s;t into one di&s;h and then into another, filled them with <HI>Pilloe,</HI> and &s;ent me at dif|rent times, double handfuls of the&s;e articles, with a pickled mango in each, on the &s;urface of the&s;e broad cakes pinch'd up like a hat to confine the meat as it was handed from the Fa&s;dar to me; when rejecting the knife and fork that was laid on purpo&s;e for me, that I might conform to the manners of the com|pany I was in, I ate with my right hand, though without being able to acquit my&s;elf with that faci|lity and fa&s;hion the Fa&s;dar and his company did.</P>
<P>The&s;e A&s;iatics in general, aver&s;e to u&s;ele&s;s and trivial altercation, are more remarkable for their taciturnity than loquacity, which I di&s;covered at this interview, notwith&s;tanding which they are &s;till &s;o|ciable and communicative, deci&s;ive, and laconic in their &s;peech, and without u&s;ing &s;trained compli|ments like the Chri&s;tians, are naturally ho&s;pitable and generous, rather than polite and ceremonial; e&s;teeming any thing that will excite laughter as ri|diculous, whether an act, word or deed: a per&s;on by his writings or expre&s;&s;ions, to acquire the name of a wit among&s;t them, would be e&s;teemed, if not a fool, a buffoon, without being pitied or de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>

<P>The Bad&s;haw having early di&s;covered the &s;ini&s;|ter views of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India Company, had a long while determined on &s;triking up a confede|racy with the Marattas, who, glad to li&s;ten to any propo&s;ition that might favor a plan they had in view, of laying all the country without Bulmon&s;in, the Beneras Rajah, Sujahdowlah's, and the Com|pany's territory, under contribution, affected to make it a bu&s;ine&s;s on purpo&s;e to march for, in order to join Alligore, who receiving a&s;&s;urances from Rumchundergunnis, Tucojah-hulkah and Sindia, to that effect he regulated him&s;elf accordingly, and Nannaby, an important Maratta, and a Bramin, likewi&s;e with Sindia, otherwi&s;e Petellzibe, and Tucojah-hulkah, (three powerful chiefs) moved their armies from the Decan, and cro&s;&s;ing the Jumnah, encamped in Anterbade, while Nagebe|kan, an enterpri&s;ing Mogul, of repute in the Bad|&s;haw's hou&s;hold, augmented his body guard to the number of 6000 Mogul hor&s;e, and engaged about double the number of Indo&s;tan cavalry, with a pro|portion of Indo&s;tan Burgondo&s;&s;es, perhaps a thou|&s;andmen, viz. mercenaries, the Bad&s;haw re&s;olved to take the field, and riding through the gates of Eleabas mounted on an elephant, followed by his Zunnannah and confidents, attended by his court, and the two battalions of Seapoys the Company had all along alotted him for his &s;afeguard, he cro&s;&s;ed the Great Ganges in a boat without di&s;|mounting,

and in a few hours afterwards joined the Maratta army on the banks of the Ganges, and encamped; having, prior to this, &s;ignified his in|tentions to the Briti&s;h commander in chief, Sir Robert Barker, then on the &s;pot, who remon&s;trated to the Emperor with all his eloquence and artifice in vain, to decline all thoughts of pro&s;ecuting &s;uch a plan, pointing out to him the inexpediency of taking the field, and expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the mercy of a rapacious &s;et of troops; but the Pacha, tired out with the reiterated impertinances of the Engli&s;h and their barefaced impo&s;itions, re&s;olutely &s;et for|ward as de&s;cribed, and joined this new formed connection as intended, who received him with all the marks of friend&s;hip in their power, and Elea|bas evacuated in a manner by this &s;tep of the Mo|gul, it taking wind through the country, his for|tunes were followed by &s;uch a number of opulent men, bankers and merchants from all parts, who, having experienced the cruel oppre&s;&s;ions of Clive, Cartier, Verel&s;t and Sikes, while at Ca&s;&s;ambuzer and Bouehier, and Dupee at Madra&s;s, with Horn|by at Bombay, and their agent in general, eagerly embraced this opportunity to &s;ave their lives and fortunes, and travelling back up into the country again in di&s;gui&s;e, by the &s;ame unfrequented by ways, &amp;c. they fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed to join the Engli&s;h, gained the Patcha's army, and offering him their pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he found him&s;elf unexpectedly in a condition to augment his forces, and add &s;trength to his credit, while the provinces of Ben|gal, Behar and Orixa, the vicinities of Madra&s;s, Bombay and Surat, felt a &s;udden want of monied men to furni&s;h them as u&s;ual, with loans upon their bonds. A few days after this the Bad&s;haw moving within four miles of Frakabad, and the Maratta army having changed their front to the rear, in order to proceed on towards the north, I em|braced
