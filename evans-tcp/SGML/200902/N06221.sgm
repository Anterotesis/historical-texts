<P>WHEREAS the King's Plea&s;ure has been &s;ignified to us by Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> one of his principal Secretaries of State, that, upon Con&s;ideration of the &s;everal Advices which have been received relating to the &s;uppo&s;ed Intention of the <HI>French</HI> to attack the I&s;land of <HI>Minorca,</HI> a Squadron of <HI>Ten</HI> Ships of the Line do forthwith &s;ail for the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> under your Command; and whereas we have appointed the <HI>Ramilies, Buckingham, Culloder, Cap|tain, Revenge, Lanca&s;ter, Trident, Intrepid, King&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Defiance,</HI> for this Service. You are hereby required and directed, immediately to put to Sea with &s;uch of them as are ready (leaving Orders for the Re&s;t to follow you as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible) and proceed with the utmo&s;t Expedition to <HI>Gibraltar.</HI></P>

<P>If, upon your Arrival at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> you &s;hall not gain Intelligence of a <HI>French</HI> Squadron having pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Straits,</HI> you are then to go on, without a Moment's Lo&s;s of Time, to <HI>Minorca;</HI> or, if in Con&s;equence of &s;uch Intelligence, you &s;hall detach Rear Admiral <HI>We&s;t,</HI> as before

directed, you are to u&s;e equal Expedition in repairing thither with the Ships which &s;hall remain with you; and if you find any Attack made upon that I&s;land by the <HI>French,</HI> you are to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Means in your Power, for its Relief: If you find to &s;uch Attack make, you are to proceed off <HI>Toulon,</HI> and &s;tation your Squadron in the be&s;t Manner you &s;hall be able, for preventing say <HI>French</HI> Ships getting out of that Port or for intercepting and &s;eizing any that may get out; and you are to exert the utmo&s;t Vigilance therein, and in protecting <HI>Minorca</HI> and <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> from any ho&s;tile Attempt.</P>
<P>You are al&s;o to be very vigilant for Protecting the Trade of his Ma|je&s;ty's Subjects from being mole&s;ted, either by the <HI>French,</HI> or by Crui|zers from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> or any other of the <HI>Barbary States;</HI> and for that Purpo&s;e to appoint proper Convoys and Cruizers.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS comes to you by Expre&s;s from hence by Way of <HI>Madrid,</HI> recommended to Sir <HI>Benjamin Keene,</HI> his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ter at that Place, to be forwarded with the utmo&s;t Expedition.</P>
<P>I arrived here with the Squadron under my Command the 2d In&s;tant, in the Afternoon, after a tedious Pa&s;&s;age of Twenty-&s;even Days, occa|&s;ioned by contrary Winds and Calms, and was extremely concerned to hear from Captain <HI>Edgecumbe,</HI> who I found here with the <HI>Prince&s;s-Loui&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Fortune</HI> Sloop, That he was obliged to retire from <HI>Mi|norca,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> having landed on that I&s;land, by all Accounts from thirteen to fifteen thou&s;and Men.</P>
<P>They failed from <HI>Toulon</HI> the 10th of la&s;t Month, with about 160, or 200 Sail of Tran&s;ports, e&s;corted by 13 Sail of Men of War, how many of the Line I have not been able to learn with any Certainty.</P>
<P>If I had been &s;o happy to have arrived at <HI>Mahon</HI> before the <HI>French</HI> had landed, I flatter my&s;elf, I &s;hould have been able to have prevented their getting a Footing on that I&s;land; but as it has &s;o unfortunately turned out, I am firmly of Opinion, from the great Force they have landed, and the Quantity of Provi&s;ions, Stores, and Ammunition of all Kinds they brought with them, that the throwing Men into the Ca&s;tle, will only enable it to hold out but a little Time longer, and add to the Numbers that mu&s;t fall into the Enemy's Hands; for the Garri&s;on in Time will be obliged to &s;urrender, unle&s;s a &s;ufficient Number of Men could be landed to di&s;lodge the <HI>French,</HI> or rai&s;e the Siege: However, I am determined to &s;ail up to <HI>Minorca</HI> with the Squadron, where I &s;hall be a better Judge of the Situation of Affairs there, and will give General <HI>Blakeney</HI> all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he &s;hall require, though I am afraid all Communication will be cut off between us; as is the Opinion of the chief Engineer of this Garri&s;on (who has &s;erved in that I&s;land) and that of the other Officers of the Artillery who are acquainted with the Situation of the Harbour: For if the Enemy have erected Batteries on the two Shores near the Entrance of the Harbour (an Advantage &s;carce to be &s;uppo&s;ed they have neglected) it will render it impo&s;&s;ible for our Boats to have a Pa&s;&s;age to the Sally Port of the Garri&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>The TRIAL OF Vice-Admiral <HI>BYNG.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Summer of the Year 1756, will be ever memorable for the Lo&s;&s;es and Di&s;graces we &s;uffered in the <HI>Mediter|ranean.</HI> The Lo&s;s of <HI>Minorca</HI> without the lea&s;t Attempt for its Relief, and the Lo&s;s of a Victory after it was more than half gained, are Facts too notorious to be de|nied; die fatal Con&s;equences of which are &s;en&s;ibly felt as well in the Di&s;reputation brought on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Arms, as in the va&s;t Detriment to our Commerce in that Part of the World. But to whom the&s;e Misfortunes and Mi&s;carriages ought to be imputed, is the great Que&s;tion which for the&s;e &s;ix Months pa&s;t, has been the general Topic of Conver&s;ation, and rai&s;ed &s;uch a Spirit throughout the Kingdom, as evidently &s;hewed how dearly the Glory of their King and Country is prized by all <HI>True Britons.</HI> Some have laid the Blame on the Mini&s;try, in delaying too long the &s;ending Succours for the Relief of &s;o important a Place, and the Incompetency of tho&s;e Succours, when &s;ent, for ac|compli&s;hing a Bu&s;ine&s;s in which the Intere&s;t of the Nation in general was &s;o nearly concerned. Others again were no le&s;s warm in their Cen&s;ures of Admiral <HI>Byng,</HI> and impute the whole Mi&s;carriage to his Neglect, Cowardice, or Mi&s;conduct. And as the Admiral was the immediate In&s;trument employed in this great Affair, the general Voice was loud in demanding Ju&s;tice upon him, as if to his Mi&s;management alone this irreparable Misfortune ought to be attributed. And the Letter which he wrote to the Admiralty, giving an Account of his Engagement with the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, as in&s;erted in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> in&s;tead of allaying the Cla|mour, &s;erved only to increa&s;e the general Indignation of the Public a|gain&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="007892_0006_102DF6E5B4732F60">
him. The Admiral, however, to vindicate his own Conduct, and to &s;top the Torrent of Calumny, which came pouring upon him from every Quarter, thought proper to publi&s;h &s;ome Pamphlets, wherein he affirms that the Letter publi&s;hed in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> as coming from him, was &s;o altered, mutilated and curtailed, by tho&s;e who conveyed it to the Pre&s;s, that a quite different Turn was given to his true Sen&s;e and Meaning, with a De&s;ign, as he &s;uppo&s;es, to bring upon him the Re|&s;entment of his King and Country, and the general Odium for the Lo&s;s of <HI>Minorca;</HI> which, he &s;ays, ought rather to be attributed to tho&s;e who had the Direction or the Expedition, than to him who was only em|ployed as an In&s;trument in the Execution of it. But whether the Ad|miral was deficient in his Duty or not, yet I think, to &s;peak impartially, his Letter ought to have been given to the Public in his own identical Words, for which only he could be an&s;werable, and the doing other|wi&s;e, was certainly incon&s;i&s;tent with that Honour and Ju&s;tice which is due to an Officer of &s;uch Di&s;tinction, whether guilty or innocent of the Crime laid to his Charge, &s;ince, at that Time, it was the only authentic Information the Public could have of &s;uch an important Tran&s;action, of which he was the &s;ole Manager.</P>
<P>Upon Receipt of the Admiral's Letter, and other Advices from the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> that the Garri&s;on at Fort <HI>St. Philip</HI>'s had not been re|lieved, and was in the utmo&s;t Danger of falling into the Hands of the Enemy, the Government thought fit to &s;end out another Squadron, un|der the Command of Sir <HI>Edward Hawke,</HI> with a Commi&s;&s;ion to examine into the Conduct and Behaviour of the Admirals and Officers, and en|quire into the Cau&s;es of the ill Succe&s;s of that Expedition. Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> pur&s;uant to his In&s;tructions, when he came to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and had got what Intelligence he could by Enquiry, delivered to Admiral <HI>Byng,</HI> the Order for his Su&s;pen&s;ion, and &s;ent him home Pri&s;oner in the <HI>Antelope.</HI></P>
<P>On the Admiral's Arrival at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> an Order was &s;ent to Ad|miral <HI>O&s;borne</HI> to put him under Arre&s;t, and for his Removal to <HI>London;</HI> but he was not got far on his Way, before his Guard were met by a Me&s;&s;enger from the Admiralty, with an Order to convey him back a|gain to the Ship. In a few Days after, a &s;trong Detachment of the Guards brought him away, and lodged him in the Hou&s;e of the Go|vernor of <HI>Greenwich</HI> Ho&s;pital, where he was &s;trictly confined, under a &s;trong Guard, till the Time of his Trial.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007892_0007_102DF6E7DF109360">
As &s;oon as the Admiral was made acquainted with the Nature of the Charge again&s;t him, as contained in the Warrant of the Lords of the Admiralty to their Mar&s;hal, he writes to Mr. <HI>Cleveland,</HI> their Lord&s;hip's Secretary, de&s;iring the Liberty of &s;ending for &s;uch a Number of Witne&s;&s;es as he judged nece&s;&s;ary for his Defence, and gave a Li&s;t of Thirty-&s;even, with their Names; which their Lord&s;hips complied with. This Letter was dated <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 4, and he was further told by the Secretary, that they would be &s;ent for Home in the <HI>Colchester.</HI> The Admiral how|ever, about a Month afterwards, <HI>September</HI> 6, de&s;ires, in a Letter to the Secretary, Permi&s;&s;ion of their Lord&s;hips, to &s;end for another Set of Witne&s;&s;es from the Fleet, to the Number of Thirty-one. But their Lord&s;hips con&s;idering how detrimental to the public Service, the Ab|&s;ence of &s;uch a Number of Officers from their Duty might be, and ima|gining that Mr. <HI>Byng</HI>'s De&s;ign was only to gain Time and delay his Trial, did not think fit to comply with his Reque&s;t; and acquainted him, that as &s;oon as the Witne&s;&s;es already &s;ent for &s;hould come over, they intended to bring on his Trial, which they &s;aw no Rea&s;on to po&s;t|pone any longer.</P>
<P>The Witne&s;&s;es being all arrived and in Readine&s;s, the Trial was ap|pointed to come on on <HI>Monday, December</HI> 27, on Board the <HI>St. George,</HI> lying in <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> Harbour.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 23, the Admiral arrived at <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> in a Coach and Six, guarded by a Party of fifty Hor&s;e, and went directly to Mr. <HI>Hutchins</HI>'s, Boat&s;wain of the Dock-yard, where a Marine Guard mounted every Day.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, December</HI> 27. A Jack in the Mizen Shrouds was hoi&s;ted on Board the <HI>St. George</HI> as a Signal for a Court Martial; about nine a Gun fired for all Captains in the Harbour to come on Board; the Com|mi&s;&s;ion was read, and the Members of the Court were &s;worn; which was all that was done this Day; and then adjourn'd till next Morning nine o'Clock.

<P>Five Hours were appointed for their &s;itting each Day; but none of them allowed to go a&s;hore till the Trial &s;hould be fini&s;hed; but Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> and his Witne&s;&s;es might come a&s;hore every Night, if they thought fit. The Court was order'd to be open, and free Admittance given to every Body who had the Curio&s;ity to hear the Trial, which occa&s;ion'd a numerous Concour&s;e of People on Board every Day.</P>
<P>All Things being in Order, and the Witne&s;&s;es ready, the Charge was open'd, which was to this Effect,</P>
<P><Q>THAT he, <HI>John Byng,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Admiral of the <HI>Blue</HI> Squadron of his Maje&s;ty's Fleet in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> during the Engagement of His Maje&s;ty's &s;aid Fleet, and the Fleet of the <HI>French</HI> King, on the 20th of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, did withdraw, or keep back, and did not do his utmo&s;t to take, &s;eize and de&s;troy the Ships of the <HI>French</HI> King, which it was his Duty to have engaged, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;uch of his Maje&s;ty's Ships as were engaged in Fight with the <HI>French</HI> Ships, which it was his Duty to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted; and for that he the &s;aid <HI>John Byng</HI> did not do his utmo&s;t to relieve St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s Ca&s;tle, in his Maje&s;ty's I&s;land of <HI>Minorca,</HI> then be&s;ieged by the Forces of the <HI>French</HI> King; but acted contrary to, and in Breach of his In&s;tructions given the Lords of the Admi|ralty, by his Maje&s;ty's Command.</Q></P>
<P>After which he made the following Speech to the Court:</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>I think my&s;elf extremely happy in my pre&s;ent Situation, to have my Conduct enquired into by Gentlemen of your well-known Abilities, Integrity, and Candor; and, from thence I hope to an&s;wer for my &s;elf with Honour, and to demon&s;trate my Innocence of the Accu&s;ations exhibited again&s;t me.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> 29. The fir&s;t Witne&s;s &s;worn was Admiral <HI>We&s;t,</HI> who depo&s;ed to the Effect following:</P>
<P>Being a&s;k'd, whether he had ever delivered his Opinion, an&s;wered: This Que&s;tion appears to me of an extraordinary Nature, I cannot con|ceive that, as a Witne&s;s, I am at all called upon to know at what I ex|pre&s;&s;ed Di&s;&s;atisfaction. It is not a Matter of Fact as to my particular
<PB N="9" REF="007892_0009_102DF6ECEB805658">
Opinion: There might be Appearances at which I might expre&s;s Di&s;&s;a|tisfaction, and they not Facts. When I &s;aw the Rear of our Fleet a|&s;tern, I could not but be di&s;&s;atisfied with that Appearance. I &s;aw the Fleet in that Situation, but cannot tell the Rea&s;on: Therefore my O|pinion, that I may have given, may be founded upon what was not really Fact, tho' it appeared to me to be &s;o. As to the other Ships, I know nothing of their Situation. I went down and engaged my proper Ship till &s;he bore away; after that I went and engaged a-head with the <HI>Lanca&s;ter;</HI> then the Rear came up, and engaged them as long as they &s;taid. I have given in all the&s;e Particulars; and if the Court de&s;ires to know my Opinion without Facts, it was what I did not expect. I de|&s;ire to give every Light into this Matter that may inform the Court, but the Court may be mi&s;led by my Opinion, without Facts. Where a Judgment is drawn from Evidence, it is drawn from Evidence of Facts. I may have conceived a wrong Opinion, either from its not being well founded on Facts, or from my making a wrong Judgment of tho&s;e that did appear. I only mean to &s;ay, that this is a Que&s;tion, my An&s;wer to which may mi&s;lead, becau&s;e it may be founded on Appearances; there was an Appearance from the Fleet's being &s;o far a-&s;tern; there was an Appearance of &s;ome Want in &s;omebody, but with whom I cannot pre|tend to &s;ay.</P>
<P>His Examination la&s;ted till near Five in the Evening. When the Court was adjourning, he begged they would complete his Examination that Night, becau&s;e he was going out upon an Expedition of great Im|portance, by the King's Special Order: But as the Court and Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> had many Que&s;tions to a&s;k him, the Court informed him, they &s;hould be glad to go through, but that there was not Time; and then the Court adjourn'd till next Morning.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> 30. Admiral <HI>We&s;t</HI> appeared, and fini&s;hed his Examination about three in the Afternoon. In the Cour&s;e of his Examination, &s;ome of the mo&s;t material Que&s;tions were, Whether any unnece&s;&s;ary Delay was made at St. <HI>Helen</HI>'s, or at <HI>Gibraltar?</HI> An&s;wered in the Negative. At what Di&s;tance the <HI>Ramillies</HI> was from the <HI>Buckingham</HI> at the Time of the Engagement? He replied, about three Miles. Whether the Ad|miral and the Rear could have come up to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Van, and come to a clo&s;e Engagement with the Enemy? He an&s;wer'd, he knew no Impediment to the contrary; but that he would not be under|&s;tood
<PB N="10" REF="007892_0010_102DF6EFAD0A6928">
to mean that there was none. How the Wind and Weather was? He replied, very calm and fine. Whether he could keep his lower Ports open? He replied, yes; and that he knew of but one Ship that could not, and that was the <HI>Deptford,</HI> who lower'd her Ports occa&s;ionally. How many Men he had kill'd and wounded? He an&s;wer'd, Three kill'd and Seven wounded. What Damage he receiv'd in his Hull, Ma&s;ts, Yards, and Rigging? For an An&s;wer to which he referred them to a written Account he had deliver'd into Court thereof. He was a&s;ked in what Condition the Ship was in regard to Men, on the 20th of <HI>May,</HI> the Morning of the Engagement? He replied in very good. Whether he &s;aw any Fire from the Admiral's Ship during the Engagement? He &s;aid, when he was looking towards the <HI>Intrepid,</HI> which was in Di&s;tre&s;s a-&s;tern of her, he did &s;ee &s;ome Smoak, which probably might be from the Ad|miral's Ship, or &s;ome of his Divi&s;ion; but he could not di&s;cover at what Ship it was directed. Whether on the 24th of <HI>May,</HI> the Day of the Council of War, his Ship was repaired, fit for a &s;econd Engagement? He an&s;wer'd, yes, before that. When? He an&s;wer'd, the very next Night after the Engagement.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> a&s;ked him, whether it was not in the Power of the Enemy to decline coming to a clo&s;e Engagement, as the two Fleets were &s;ituated? He replied, yes; but as they lay to for our Fleet, he apprehended they intended to fight. Whether he was of Opinion, that the Forces on board the Fleet could have relieved <HI>Minorca?</HI> He &s;aid, He believed not.&mdash; Whether &s;ome of the Ships were not deficient in their Compliment of Men, &s;ome of the Ships out of Repair, and whether not deficient in Point of Force with the Enemy? To which he an&s;wered in the Affirmative.</P>
<P>The Court having done with Mr. <HI>We&s;t,</HI> Lord <HI>Blakeney</HI> was &s;worn. In the Cour&s;e of the Examination, he informed the Court of the Time the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fleet was di&s;covered by the Garri&s;on, and the Time of its di&s;appearing; that upon Sight of it he wrote a Letter to be carried off by Mr. <HI>Boyd</HI> the Store-keeper, and Aid de Camp to Col. <HI>Jeffreys,</HI> to inform the Admiral of his Situation, &amp;c. A Copy of which Letter he had in his Hand, and de&s;ired it might be read. But Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> ob|jecting thereto, as it was only a Copy, and not the Original, it was not read, becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Boyd</HI> was to be examined thereto, and could produce the Original.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="007892_0011_102DF6F152ECE8E0">
Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> asked the General, Whether he thought the Forces could be landed? He an&s;wered very ea&s;ily. Whether there were not Fa&s;cines in the Way? He &s;aid, Yes; but they might ea&s;ily have been de&s;troyed. Whether the Attempt to land the Men would not have been attended with Danger? The General replied, <Q>Danger! mo&s;t certainly. It could not be &s;o ea&s;y as &s;topping into this Ship. I have been upwards of 50 Years in the Service, and I never knew any Expedition of Con&s;equence carried into Execution, but what was attended with &s;ome Danger; but of all the Expeditions I ever knew, this was certainly the wor&s;t.</Q> Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> a&s;k'd, Whether the French had not a Ca&s;tle at the Point, which might have prevented their Landing? The General an&s;wered, Not the 20th of <HI>May;</HI> and &s;aid, that the Enemy were in &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;s for Am|munition, that they fired Stones at the Garri&s;on. Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> a&s;k'd the General, Whether the Officers and few Men he had on board the Fleet, would have been of any great Service to the Garri&s;on? He an&s;wered, Yes, of very great Service; for that he was obliged, at that Time to &s;et &s;ome of his Men to plai&s;ter the Breaches. He added, That he believed, had the Detachment been landed, he might have held out, 'till Sir <HI>Edward Hawke</HI> came, tho' without &s;ufficient Force to drive the Enemy away, he could not &s;ave the I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>Friday,</HI> 31. Mr. <HI>Boyd</HI> was &s;worn. In the Cour&s;e of his Examination it appeared that he was &s;ent off with a Letter, in a Boat, to deliver to the Admiral, but could not be particular to the Time; that he kept out as long as he thought it probable to reach the Admiral; but when he found it impracticable to clo&s;e the Admiral, as he was then going to the Southward, he returned without delivering the Letter.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident of the Court a&s;king him, if a 20 Gun Ship could have come and de&s;troyed the Battery? An&s;wered, Yes, if there had been deep Water, which he could not &s;ay, not having ever &s;ounded it, tho' he had often heard it reported that there was deep Water at that Place.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> a&s;k'd him, How long he waited before the Boat was ready to bring him off. He could not recollect, but remember'd he waited for it till he was very impatient. Whether he in the Boat did not pa&s;s thro' &s;ome Firings of the Enemy? An&s;wered, There was &s;ome &s;trag|gling Fire of &s;mall Arms, and about three or four Cannon Shot. Whe|ther it did not do them &s;ome Damage? He an&s;wered, No; he did not know that &s;o much as one of them touched the Boat. How long
<PB N="12" REF="007892_0012_102DF6F3865F7C28">
he might be off in the Boat? About an Hour and a Half. Whether there was not a Breeze of Wind? An&s;wer'd, When he got from the Land, he found a Breeze. Whether he thought the Admiral could &s;ee the Boat? An&s;wered No; he believed not at that Di&s;tance, and &s;o late in the Evening.</P>
<P>The next Witne&s;s examin'd was Capt. <HI>Everitt,</HI> who, before he gave his Evidence, de&s;ired to hear the Articles of the Charge, he not hap|pening to be in Court when they were formerly read, which Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> objected to, as contrary to the Cu&s;tom of the Court; but on the Cap|tain's Reque&s;t they were read. Captain <HI>Everitt</HI> being &s;worn, and ha|ving &s;ome Papers in his Hand, was a&s;ked what they were? He an|&s;wered, They were Minutes he had taken from the Ship's Log-Book, and his own Journal, to refre&s;h his Memory. To the u&s;ing of which Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> objected, the Log-Book not being a proper Te&s;timony. Whereupon the Court was cleared, to deliberate upon the Point. Upon the Court's being opened again, their Opinion was, That tho&s;e Minutes might be u&s;ed to refre&s;h his Memory upon &s;uch Points only as fell im|mediately under his own Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In the Cour&s;e of his Examination it appeared, that there was all po&s;&s;ible Di&s;patch made, and no unnece&s;&s;ary Delay in the Sailing of the Fleet from St. <HI>Helen</HI>'s to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Mabon;</HI> that the <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s Men were healthy, having but two incapable of com|ing to their Quarters; that they had 90 or 100 Tons of Water on Board; that they got Sight of the I&s;land of <HI>Minorca</HI> about Six in the Morning of the 19th of <HI>May;</HI> that about Eleven in the Forenoon they were two Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>St. Philip</HI>'s Ca&s;tle, and believed that was the neare&s;t Di&s;tance he was to it; that about Two in the Afternoon the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was &s;een di&s;tinctly, &s;tanding to the We&s;tward, but could not &s;ay at what Di&s;tance; that our Fleet was &s;tanding to the S.E. the Wind at S.S.W. moderate fine Weather; that on the 20th of <HI>May,</HI> about Eight in the Morning, they &s;aw the <HI>French</HI> Fleet preparing for Engagement.</P>
<P>The like Que&s;tions were propo&s;ed to him as to Admiral <HI>West;</HI> and in his An&s;wers was of Opinion, That the Admiral's Divi&s;ion might have carried all their Sail, and thereby a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Van, and prevented them from receiving &s;o much Fire from the Enemy's Rear.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="007892_0013_102DF6F64210E670">
Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> was a&s;ked. Whether he cho&s;e to a&s;k Captain <HI>Everitt</HI> &s;ay Que&s;tions? To which he replied. He had no Que&s;tions to propo&s;e then, but &s;hould have Occa&s;ion to a&s;k him &s;ome hereafter, therefore de&s;ired he might be kept in the Way for that Purpo&s;e. Captain <HI>Everitt</HI> &s;aid, He &s;hould have been very glad if tho&s;e Que&s;tions could then be a&s;ked, as he was under Sailing Orders with Admiral <HI>West.</HI> Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> an&s;wered, He could not propo&s;e them at that Time, but would as &s;oon is po&s;&s;ible; upon which Capt. <HI>Everitt</HI> was ordered to attend the Court.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> then informed the Court, that he wanted to a&s;k Lord <HI>Blakeney</HI> &s;ome Que&s;tions. Whereupon the General was ordred to at|tend the next Morning at Nine o'Clock; to which Time the Court then adjourned.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Jan.</HI> 1. Lord <HI>Blakeney</HI> appeared in Court, in Con&s;equence of Mr. <HI>Brag</HI>'s Reque&s;t; when the Admiral propo&s;ed a Que&s;tion, the Sub&s;tance of which, and the An&s;wers were as follows: Whether if the Admiral had landed his Troops, it could have &s;aved <HI>St. Philip</HI>'s from falling into the Hands of the Enemy? His Lord&s;hip &s;aid, It was im|po&s;&s;ible for him to an&s;wer that Que&s;tion with any Certainty; but he was of Opinion, that had they been landed, he &s;hould have been able to have hold out the Siege till Sir <HI>Edward Hawke</HI> had come to his Relief.</P>
<P>Then the four <HI>Fir&s;t Lieutenants</HI> of the <HI>Buckingham,</HI> Captain <HI>Everitt,</HI> Admiral <HI>West</HI>'s Ship, were examined, and all agreed, that they knew of no Impediment to hinder the Admiral and his Divi&s;ion, from coming to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Van, which was clo&s;ely engaged, and raked by the Enemy's Rear as they came up; and that the Admiral was not &s;een by them to go to a clo&s;e Engagement with the Enemy, agreable to his own Signals.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, Jan.</HI> 3. Captain <HI>Everitt</HI> was cro&s;s-examined by the Court and Mr. <HI>Byng;</HI> and being a&s;ked, How many Guns the Ships in the Van carried? an&s;wered, That the Sides of tho&s;e next the <HI>Buckingham</HI> had 14 on the lower Deck, all the others 13. Of what Rats they were? an&s;wered, One a 74 Gun Ship, the others 64, and &s;ix in Number. Whether, if Admiral <HI>Byng</HI> had come to a clo&s;e Engagement, a com|pleat Victory might not have been obtained? An&s;wer, There was all the Rea&s;on in the World to expect it; it being well known that Admi|ral <HI>West</HI> beat off two Ships, though he had but five Ships to their &s;ix, and ours &s;maller Ships than theirs, and their Metal heavier. How the

Wind? as fair a Gale as could be wi&s;hed for. Whether he had too much or too little? An&s;wer, Ju&s;t enough, and no more. What Sail had Mr. <HI>Byng?</HI> An&s;wer, His lower Cour&s;es, Top and Top-Gallant Sails full; but his Main-Sail, Main-Top-Sail, and Top-gallant Sail, a-back.</P>
<P>The Court then a&s;ked Mr. <HI>Byng,</HI> If he &s;hould have Occa&s;ion to a&s;k Capt. <HI>Everitt,</HI> or any of the <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s People, any more Que&s;tions? and being an&s;wered in the Negative, the Captain, and the re&s;t of the Officers of the <HI>Buckingham,</HI> were di&s;charged from any further Atten|dance on the Court, and were informed they might repair on Board their Ship.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Gilebri&s;t</HI> &s;worn. He acquainted the Court, that he was &s;ituated oppo&s;ite the Rear Admiral on the 20th of <HI>May</HI> to repeat Signals. In the Cour&s;e of his Examination he &s;aid, Every Ship did not bear down at a proper Di&s;tance to attack the Enemy, according to Signals thrown out by the Admiral, about Half an Hour pa&s;t Two o'Clock; but the Rear-Admiral and his Divi&s;ion bore down before the Wind, and hauled up oppo&s;ite to their proper Ships, and attacked the Enemy, except the <HI>Defiance,</HI> which appeared to be a-head; that the Ships in the Rear were in a Line of Battle a-head; upon which the <HI>Defiance</HI> threw all a-back, and fell down upon her proper Ship, the Head-mo&s;t Ship of the Ene|my; that the Admiral did not bear down before the Wind upon the Enemy, nor any of his Divi&s;ion; that the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, at the Time of the Signal, were all lying too with their Main-Top-Sails to the Ma&s;ts; and that our Van was in the &s;ame Po&s;ition. He could not take upon him to &s;ay, whether the Admiral ever engaged at a proper Di&s;tance, on Account of the Smoak from the Firings of the <HI>Revenge, Prince&s;s Lou|i&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Trident,</HI> He agreed that the Wind, Weather, and Situation of the Enemy's Fleet, were &s;uch as to enable them to engage at a proper Di&s;tance; that the Ships in the Rear did not make all the Sail they could to clo&s;e with the Enemy, from the Time the Signal was given for Battle till the Action was over; but that, in the latter Part of the Action, Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> &s;et all his Sail, except his Top-Gallant Sails; that the Wind and Weather was &s;uch, that he could have carried all the Sail in the Ship that he commanded, and knew no Rea&s;on why he did not; that the Van of our Fleet was engaged about an Hour and a Quarter; that the Admiral did not continue in the &s;ame Po&s;ition, but kept la&s;king away, angling upon the Enemy; that he &s;aw the <HI>Ramillies</HI> fire; that the
<PB N="15" REF="007892_0015_102DF6FA1093E198">
Di&s;tance of the Rear Divi&s;ion from the Van &s;eemed to be about three Miles; that he made no Doubt, if the Admiral had carried Sail all along, but they might have prevented the Enemy's Rear from pouring &s;ome of their Fire into our Van; and that the Di&s;tance between our Rear and Van, was occa&s;ioned by the Rear throwing their Top-&s;ails a-back when they began to fire.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked, If the Admiral had engaged, whether he might have defeated the <HI>French?</HI> an&s;wered, That his Opinion was, he might.</P>
<P>Another Officer, who&s;e Name is forgot, was peremptorily a&s;ked, If he &s;aw the Admiral engaged? an&s;wered, He &s;aw a Firing. When one of the Gentlemen &s;aid &s;omewhat &s;martly, Is not firing engaging? The Officer replied, He did not call firing of Guns at &s;o great a Di&s;tance engaging.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Hervey,</HI> of the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> &s;worn. He was &s;tationed a-brea&s;t the Admiral to repeat Signals. He &s;aid, that about Forty-three Minutes after Two, Signal was made for the <HI>Deptford</HI> to quit the Line; and about fifty Minutes after Two the <HI>Ramillies</HI> began to fire upon the E|nemy, having before that received the Fire of the three &s;ternmo&s;t Ships of the Enemy for about ten or twelve Minutes, in which Time he ob|&s;erved &s;ome of the Enemy's Shot to fall between the <HI>Ramillies</HI> and his Ship the <HI>Phoenix;</HI> about the &s;ame Time he ob&s;erved the <HI>Intrepid</HI>'s Fore-top Ma&s;t to be lo&s;t; he ob&s;erved then the quick Motion of the <HI>Intrepid</HI> in bearing down, had occa&s;ioned her to be raked by the Enemy, to have lo&s;t her Top-Ma&s;t, and to have run the Ri&s;que of falling on Board the Admiral, who was then engaged, and might not &s;ee them Time enough to prevent it. Some Time after the <HI>Ramillies</HI> cea&s;ed Fire, the eleventh Ship in the Enemy's Line bore away from the <HI>Ramillies</HI> Fire, as was concluded by the People on Board; that the <HI>Culloden</HI> fired but a few Times, and at a greater Di&s;tance than the <HI>Ramillies;</HI> that the whole Fire cea&s;ed about Five in the Afternoon; that the Enemy &s;eemed to go off from the Fire of our Van, &s;ome of them not damaged. This in general; but the Pre&s;ident de&s;iring him to give as di&s;tinct and particular Account as he could of the Action, after the Signal to engage; he gave his Evidence as follows:</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, I am to begin with the Signal to engage; the Minutes I have in my Hand are only in re&s;pect to Time. The Signal was made about 20 Minutes after Two for engaging. At the Time the Signal was made, &s;ome
<PB N="16" REF="007892_0016_102DF6FBB679E088">
of the Engli&s;h Fleet bore away more than others; which I take to be owing to the Ships in the Van not having ob&s;erved the Signal before for leading large, which was made by the Admiral, and which I repeated about Two; I recollect to have repeated it two or three Times after|wards. The Admiral bore down with his Top&s;ails, and, as near as I can recollect, with his Fore&s;ail &s;et at that Time; and I very well remem|ber &s;aying, that the Admiral &s;eemed to me to bear away rather more than either of the Seconds. The <HI>Buckingham</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> bore down al&s;o on the Ships of the Enemy, which, as I imagined, they took to have fell to their Lot. The <HI>Intrepid</HI> I &s;aw bear right down. I cannot &s;ay, I was exce&s;&s;ively minute upon the Proceedings of the Van then, I was more attentive to the Admiral, whole Signals I was to repeat; and another Rea&s;on was, I was then employed in &s;hifting Men and Things into a Schooner, which was ordered to attend me, and in compleating and fitting my Ship for burning as a Fire-&s;hip.</P>
<P>It was about half an Hour pa&s;t Two, I think, when &s;ome of the French Van began to fire, and &s;oon after that the Fire became general, except from two or three of the Sternmo&s;t of the Enemy, and they &s;eem|ed to be re&s;erving their Fire for the Admiral Commander in Chief, who was then going down upon them. About 43 Minutes after Two, the Signal was made for the <HI>Deptford</HI> to quit the Line; I had my Watch in my Hand, and therefore can be more particular, and I think it was about fifty Minutes after Two that the <HI>Ramilies</HI> began to fire, having before received the Fire of the&s;e &s;ternmo&s;t Ships of the Enemy for about 10 or 12 Minutes (I am not certain as to a Minute or two) in which Time, I ob&s;erved &s;everal of the Enemy's Shot to fall between the <HI>Ra|milies</HI> and the Ship I commanded. It was about this Time, when I ob|&s;erved the <HI>Intrepid</HI>'s Forema&s;t to be &s;hot away; it might have been done &s;ooner, but I did not ob&s;erve it till then; &s;he &s;eemed then to lay muzzled, her Fore-&s;ail a-back, or in the Wind, and her Main top-&s;ail in the Wind al&s;o; I imagined that to be from her Fore-tack being &s;hot away, or &s;ome of that Kind. About Three I &s;aw the <HI>Revenge, Prince&s;s Loui&s;a</HI> and <HI>Trident,</HI> all three with their Top&s;ails a-back, the <HI>Revenge</HI> very near the <HI>Intrepid,</HI> under her Lee Quarter, and a little a-&s;tern with|al. I remember then to have &s;aid upon Deck, that quick Motion of the <HI>Intrepid's,</HI> in bearing down right before the Wind, occa&s;ioned her being raked and lo&s;ing her Fore-top-Ma&s;t, and the Ship next to her not pa&s;|&s;ing
<PB N="17" REF="007892_0017_102DF6FDE10A82E8">
her would bring tho&s;e Ships a-&s;tern of her, and a-head of the Ad|miral, in &s;uch a Clu&s;ter, that they would run the Ri&s;que of dropping on Board of the Admiral, who was then engaged, and probably might not &s;ee them &s;oon enough to prevent it. About five or &s;ix Minutes after Three, I &s;aw the <HI>Ramilies</HI>'s Top&s;ails a-back, and at the &s;ame Time, a Yellow Flag at the Mizen-top-Ma&s;t-Head, which was hauled down while I was endeavouring to repeat it, and a Yellow Flag hoi&s;ted at the Fore-top-Ma&s;t Head. I take that Yellow Flag at the Mizen-top-Ma&s;t Head to have been up five or &s;ix Minutes, becau&s;e, while the Men at the Mizen-top-Ma&s;t were bending it, I was obliged to order it down again, to re|peat that which was hoi&s;ted on Board the Admiral at the Fore-top-Ma&s;t Head, I having but one Yellow Flag on Board. About &s;ix or &s;even Minutes afterwards, a red En&s;ign was hoi&s;ted at the Mizen-top-Ma&s;t Head; and I believe it was much about the Time of the Signals being made to bring to, that the <HI>Ramilies</HI> cea&s;ed firing. In Narratives of this Kind, one cannot keep Time &s;o exactly as I could wi&s;h, but mu&s;t go back from one Thing to another.</P>
<P>At the Time of the Smoak being cleared away by their cea&s;ing firing, I ob&s;erved the eleventh Ship in the Enemy's Line to have kept away large with his Main-top&s;ail Yard down, which I remember, on board, we then concluded was from the <HI>Ramillies</HI> Fire, for the <HI>Culloden</HI> had fired but very few Guns, and tho&s;e at a greater Di&s;tance than the <HI>Ramillies.</HI></P>
<P>It was about Three when the <HI>Ramillies</HI> filled and made Sail, Fore-&s;ail, Jibb and Stay-Sail; I think that was the Sail at that Time; and at Four the Signal was made for the <HI>Che&s;terfield</HI> to lay by the <HI>Intrepid,</HI> and then the <HI>Revenge, Prince&s;s Loui&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Trident</HI> were recovering their Stations in the Line a-head of the Admiral, who then had his Cour&s;es, Top-&s;ails, Jibb, and Stay-&s;ails &s;et; I think the Main-&s;ail was &s;et then, it was ju&s;t then I &s;aw it; it might have been &s;et before, but I did not ob&s;erve it till then; at that Time, or about that Time, the <HI>Intrepid</HI> being then got clear of the Line, I then &s;aw the <HI>Deptford</HI> &s;hifting her Pendant to the Fore-top-Ma&s;t Head, hoi&s;ting a red En&s;ign, and &s;he crowded Sail, &s;eemingly to me, to be &s;tanding for the <HI>Intrepid</HI>'s Station in the Line.</P>
<P>About Five the whole Firing cea&s;ed; I then &s;aw the <HI>Buckingham</HI> with her Main-top-Sail Yard down, and I think her Fore-top-gallant Sail and Sprit-&s;ail &s;et. The <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Portland</HI> were then at &s;ome
<PB N="18" REF="007892_0018_102DF70180995200">
Di&s;tance from the <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the <HI>Captain</HI> rather upon the <HI>Bucking|ham</HI>'s Weather Quarter, and a-&s;tern withal, and the <HI>Defiance</HI> clo&s;e upon the <HI>Captain</HI>'s Weather Quarter. The <HI>Defiance,</HI> before that &s;eemed to be di&s;abled in her Sails and Rigging, which I imagined, occa&s;ioned her to fall a-&s;tern out of her Station.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> fourth or fifth Ship from the Van, &s;eemed to me to have bore away from the Fire of our Ships in the Van, and very &s;oon after|wards the three headmo&s;t of the Enemy did the &s;ame; but none of them appeared to me to be di&s;abled: So that, whether it was to avoid the Action, or by a Signal from the Commander in Chief (for I &s;aw Flags flying on board the <HI>French</HI> Admiral) I &s;hould rather imagine the latter, as I had not ob&s;erved any &s;uch clo&s;e Engagement as to oblige Ships of their &s;eeming Force, to avoid an Action, which I imagine they had in their Power from the Beginning, by out-&s;ailing the Ships of our Fleet, as well as I could ob&s;erve, when our Ships had more Sail &s;et than what I ob&s;erved the Enemy to have.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked, If the Flags which he &s;aw on board the <HI>French</HI> Admiral, might not be Signals to recal his retreating Ships, as well as to call them off? an&s;wered, <HI>Certainly Yes.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Admiral with the re&s;t of the Ships, were then edging down under their Top-&s;ails and Fore-&s;ails to clo&s;e their Van; and tho' I ob&s;erved, that the Rear of the Fleet clo&s;ed our Van very fa&s;t, which was then very much di&s;ordered, yet they did not appear to me to gain any thing of the Enemy. A little after Five, the Rear had clo&s;ed the Van; when I &s;peak of the Van, I mean the <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who then had the <HI>Captain</HI> and <HI>Defiance</HI> upon her Weather Quarter; the <HI>Portland</HI> and <HI>Lancaster</HI> were then a con&s;iderable Way a-head.</P>
<P>About thirty Minutes after Five, the Signal was made to bring to; and a little before Six, the Signal was made to fill and &s;tand on. The <HI>Intrepid</HI> and <HI>Che&s;terfield</HI> were then a con&s;iderable Way a-&s;tern, and up|on the Weather Quarter withal.</P>
<P>At twenty Minutes after Six, the Signal was made to tack; and for the Ships that led before with the Larboard Tack, to continue to lead with the Starboard Tack. At Seven, the Signal of the Line was haul|ed down.</P>
<P>I then cea&s;ed from repeating Signals, and went on Board the Admiral to receive his Commands. That is all I know in general of the Action.</P>

<P>Captain <HI>Ambur&s;t,</HI> on his Examination, &s;aid, he thought Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> would have fought, if the <HI>French</HI> had &s;taid: But the Confu&s;ion this Evidence was in, his advancing no plau&s;ible Rea&s;on for his Belief, and his negative An&s;wers to the Que&s;tions re&s;pecting Di&s;tance, Sailing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> added to the Circum&s;tance of the <HI>French</HI> Rear's lying to an Hour and a Quarter, and in Fact, not going away till their Van retreated, made his Opinion too weak to be depended upon.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> 5. Mr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> a Lieutenant, and Mr. <HI>Philips,</HI> a Volun|teer on board the Fleet, but now a Captain, were examin'd; in who&s;e Examination nothing particular appeared further than has been already noted.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> 6. The Lieutenant of the <HI>Lancaster</HI> was examined, and then a Gentleman who was a Volunteer on board. Their Evidence &s;eemed very clear and certain as to &s;ome particular Facts which fell im|mediately under their Ob&s;ervation, but were not much in Favour of the Admiral.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Young</HI> being called and &s;worn, depos'd, That the Rear might have went down as well as him&s;elf, who had only his Top&s;ails and Fore&s;ails; but the mo&s;t remarkable Thing in his Evidence was, his &s;aying, that the <HI>lo&s;ing his Topma&s;t</HI> could neither then make him run &s;oul of the Rear, he being to Leeward, nor was it probable they could on him, the Di&s;tance being &s;o great; though this was the Admiral's Ex|cu&s;e, in his Letter publi&s;hed in the <HI>Gazette:</HI> and what Captain <HI>Hervey,</HI> the Admiral's principal Advocate, intimated in his Evidence, was very likely to have happened, had not the Admiral thrown his Sails a-back to prevent it.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Young</HI> added, that after he had cut his Rigging away, he hoi&s;ted Main Top&s;ail and Fore&s;ail, and fought again, till the <HI>Revenge</HI>'s Boat came with Notice from Captain <HI>Cornwall,</HI> that he was coming to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to de&s;ire him to cea&s;e firing, and he would place him&s;elf betwixt him and the Enemy, which he did.</P>
<P>But this Matter being more fully explained in the Captain's Cro&s;s-Ex|amination, we &s;hall give it <HI>verbatim</HI> as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Friday,</HI> 7. Did the Lo&s;s of your Fore-top-Ma&s;t put any of our Ships in our Rear in Danger of being on board you? <HI>A.</HI> Not as I could

perceive, <HI>Q.</HI> Did it occa&s;ion any Impediment to the Admiral and his Divi&s;ion from going down, and engaging the Enemy clo&s;ely? <HI>A.</HI> Not as I could perceive. <HI>Q.</HI> Did any of the Ships tack at that Time? <HI>A.</HI> I did not ob&s;erve ju&s;t then; they were to Windward of me; and I &s;aw &s;everal of the Ships upon my Weather Quarter with their Top&s;ails a|back. <HI>Q.</HI> Did you think at that Time they were in any Danger of be|ing a-board you? <HI>A.</HI> No; I was to Leeward of them, &s;o could not drive a-thwart them. <HI>Q.</HI> Could they at that Time have wore clear of you, and gone down to the Center and Rear of the Enemy? <HI>A.</HI> Yes; becau&s;e I was a-head and to Leeward. <HI>Q.</HI> Did the Admiral and his Di|vi&s;ion bear down on your Stern, and go to the Center and Rear of the Enemy? <HI>A.</HI> No; not when my Top-ma&s;t went away. <HI>Q.</HI> Did they at any Time afterwards? <HI>A.</HI> Yes, near an Hour after, and went to Leeward of me, and pa&s;&s;ed me. <HI>Q.</HI> Did they go down to the Center and Rear to engage properly? <HI>A.</HI> The French were then gone, and left me a-&s;tern. <HI>Q.</HI> What Sail had the French Rear &s;et when they pa&s;|&s;ed you? <HI>A.</HI> I think their Top&s;ails and Fore&s;ails. <HI>Q.</HI> What Sail had the Admiral and his Divi&s;ion abroad then? <HI>A.</HI> Fore&s;ails and Stay&s;ails, and the <HI>Calloden</HI> her Top-gallant-Sails. <HI>Q.</HI> How long after you lo&s;t your Top-ma&s;t was it before the Admiral and his Divi&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed to Lee|ward of you? <HI>A.</HI> About three Quarters of an Hour or an Hour. <HI>Q.</HI> With the Wind as it then was; could the Admiral and his Divi&s;ion, if they had &s;et all their Sails, from the Time the Signal for engaging was made and borne away properly, could they have come to a clo&s;e En|gagement with the Enemy? <HI>A.</HI> Yes; the French were lying to for us; I went down only under my Top-&s;ails, and they might have added Sails in Proportion to the Di&s;tance and Going of their Ships. <HI>Q.</HI> During the three Quarters of an Hour, or an Hour, which you mentioned ju&s;t now, did you ob&s;erve what Sail the Admiral and his Divi&s;ion were un|der? <HI>A.</HI> No, not particularly. <HI>Q.</HI> Did you ob&s;erve any Motions that were made for going down to the Enemy? <HI>A.</HI> No. <HI>Q.</HI> How long after you lo&s;t your Fore-ma&s;t did the Center and Rear of the French Line lay to? <HI>A.</HI> Till the <HI>Revenge</HI>'s Boat came on board me; and de|&s;ired I would leave off firing, that they might make Sail and go between me and the Enemy, which they did directly; the French Fleet then run, who were oppo&s;ite to me, and the Rear followed them. <HI>Q.</HI> After the Admiral and his Divi&s;ion had made Sail, did they get up with the Cen|ter

and Rear of the Enemy, &s;o as to come to a clo&s;e Engagement <HI>A.</HI> There was very little Action after that Time. <HI>Q.</HI> Did you, before the French run, &s;ee the Admiral and his Divi&s;ion clo&s;ely engaged with the Enemy? <HI>A.</HI> No; they were a-&s;tern and to Windward of me. <HI>Q.</HI> Did you &s;ee the Admiral and his Divi&s;ion engage from fir&s;t to la&s;t? <HI>A.</HI> Yes; &s;ome of the Ships; they fired. <HI>Q.</HI> Did you ob&s;erve at what Di&s;tance they were one from the other? <HI>A.</HI> I did not take Notice. <HI>Q.</HI> Did you &s;ee any of their Shot fall? <HI>A.</HI> No; I was too much employed to take Notice. <HI>Q.</HI> Was you within point-blank Shot of the Enemy? <HI>A.</HI> I can't judge that exactly. <HI>Q.</HI> At what Di&s;tance do you &s;uppo&s;e you were at that Time? <HI>A.</HI> Within random Mu&s;quet Shot, I believe, as the Lieutenant was wounded with a Mu&s;quet Ball. <HI>Q.</HI> How far were the Rear off at that Time? <HI>A.</HI> I did not take Notice. <HI>Q.</HI> When you bore down on the Enemy, did the Admiral and his Squadron do &s;o too? <HI>A.</HI> No. <HI>Q.</HI> Under what Sail were the Admiral and his Divi&s;ion at that Time. <HI>A.</HI> Under their Top-&s;ails and Fore-&s;ails. <HI>Q.</HI> If they had bore down as the <HI>Intrepid,</HI> could they have clo&s;ed the Enemy &s;o as to have en|gaged properly? <HI>A.</HI> Yes, the <HI>French</HI> were laying to. <HI>Q.</HI> Did they lay to long enough to admit of it, &s;uppo&s;ing the Admiral and his Divi&s;ion had &s;et all their Sails? <HI>A.</HI> Yes, long enough for me, and I &s;uppo&s;e for the re&s;t too. <HI>Q.</HI> Were our Ships in a proper Line of Battle a-head of one another, when the Signal for engaging was made? And had all our Ships bore away at the &s;ame Time, would it not have prevented the running aboard each other? <HI>A.</HI> Yes, there was a very good Line for|med; they were not &s;o near together but every Ship had Room to wear.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday,</HI> 8. Capt. <HI>Cornwall</HI> was &s;worn. In the Cour&s;e of his Ex|amination, he &s;aid, that he went to his Windows abaft to take a View of the Fleet when in Line of Battle; that he was greatly &s;urprized to &s;ee the Admiral and his Divi&s;ion at &s;o great a Di&s;tance, as he was upon the Weather Quarter; that &s;eeing the <HI>Intrepid</HI> in Di&s;tre&s;s and no Signal given for removing her out of the Line, he &s;ell into her Station, enga|ged the <HI>Foudroyant</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Admiral, as the Ship he imagined fell to his Lot, according to the then Line of Battle; &s;aid, he knew of no Impediment to prevent the Admiral's engaging at a proper Di&s;tance, any more than the re&s;t of the Fleet; ob&s;erved, he was upon his Oath to &s;wear the whole Truth, and would do &s;o, though &s;ome Things he was going to &s;ay would affect him&s;elf; confe&s;&s;ed, he went without Or|ders

to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Intrepid;</HI> and being a&s;ked by the Admiral, If he did not break through an Article of his In&s;tructions in going without his Command? an&s;wered, Yes; but added, If I did go beyond my Duty, it was my <HI>Zeal for my Country,</HI> though he mentioned another Article that favoured him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Byng,</HI> upon this, ob&s;erved to the Court, that his Reputation, which was dearer to him than his Life, nay his Life al&s;o, were in the Hands of the Court Martial, and in better Hands he de&s;ired them not; but &s;aid, he &s;hould prove, that the <HI>Revenge,</HI> by breaking the Line, was a great Impediment in his Way; and that if he could not prove that, or Something like it, <HI>The Lord have Mercy upon me.</HI></P>
<P>N. B. <HI>This Captain</HI> Cornwall <HI>lo&s;t his Arm in the memorable Engagement in the</HI> Mediterranean, <HI>under Admiral</HI> Matthews, <HI>on Board the</HI> Marl|borough, <HI>when his Uncle Captain</HI> Cornwall <HI>lo&s;t his life; being then Fir&s;t Lieutenant.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday,</HI> 10. Captain <HI>Cornwall</HI>'s Cro&s;s-Examination was fini&s;hed. <HI>Capt.</HI> Cornwall <HI>gave his Te&s;timony with great Clearne&s;s; and behaved like the Gentleman, the Sailor, and the Man of Honour.</HI></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Durell,</HI> of the <HI>Trident,</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed much the &s;ame as Captain <HI>Cornwall;</HI> did not accu&s;e the Admiral of any unnece&s;&s;ary Delay to <HI>Minorca;</HI> was of Opinion, that the Admiral and his Divi&s;ion did not &s;et all their Sail to join the Van of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fleet; but could not &s;ay the Admiral had not any Impediment to prevent it.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> 11. Captain <HI>Gardiner,</HI> Admiral <HI>Byng</HI>'s Captain, was under Examination and Re-examination all Day. He could not &s;ay all their Sails were &s;et, or that the Rear Divi&s;ion could not come up to a clo&s;e Engagement, as well as the Van; but &s;aid he advi&s;ed the Admiral to bear down, to which the Admiral objected, and gave his Rea&s;ons again&s;t it; le&s;t an Accident of a &s;imilar Nature with that of Admiral <HI>Matthews</HI> in the &s;ame Seas, &s;hould be the Con&s;equence; and had nothing to &s;ay again&s;t the Admiral's per&s;onal Behaviour; &s;aid, he believed the Admiral intended a clo&s;e Engagement, by his telling the Sailors, who&s;e Eager|ne&s;s for Action had engaged them to fire without Orders, to &s;ave their &s;hot till they came nearer to do Execution.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> 12. Captain <HI>Gardiner</HI> was again examined, and made it appear, that the Admiral took the whole Command of the Ship from him, and that nothing was done that Day but what he ordered.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="007892_0023_102DF70B7350D358">
Then the Land Officers on board the <HI>Ramillies</HI> were examined. The Lord <HI>Robert Bertie's</HI> Examination was as follows: <HI>Q.</HI> Was not your Lord&s;hip, with your Regiment, ordered to &s;erve in the Fleet under Ad|miral <HI>Byng's</HI> Command? <HI>A.</HI> The Orders I received are dated the 28th of <HI>March,</HI> from the Secretary at War. They are to put my&s;elf under the Command of Admiral <HI>Byng,</HI> and obey &s;uch Orders as I might re|ceive, from Time to Time, from him, or any other commanding that Squadron. <HI>Q.</HI> Do you know of any Troops embarked in the Fleet, be&s;ides your Regiment, except &s;ome few Officers and Recruits, and the Detachment from the Garri&s;on at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> that were put on Board the Ships of Mr. <HI>Edgcumbe</HI>'s Squadron, in the room of &s;ome of their Men that were left in the Garri&s;on of <HI>St. Philip? A.</HI> No. <HI>Q.</HI> Do you ap|prehend, that the throwing in about an hundred Men, con&s;i&s;ting of Officers and Recruits, would have enabled the Garri&s;on to hold out a|gain&s;t the Enemy's Attacks? <HI>A.</HI> No; I apprehend they were of much more Service on Board the Fleet. <HI>Q.</HI> Was you upon the Quarter-Deck near the Admiral, during the whole Time of the Enemy's firing? <HI>A.</HI> Yes; I was near the Admiral during the whole Time that the <HI>Ramillies</HI> was fired upon. <HI>Q.</HI> Did the Admiral, from the Time the Signal was made to engage, continue going down upon the Enemy? <HI>A.</HI> It appear|ed to me, that he was going down &s;tanding to the Enemy, till &s;uch Time as the Admiral laid a-back. <HI>Q.</HI> Will you be plea&s;ed to inform the Court, if, during the Time of Action on the 20th of <HI>May,</HI> the Admiral ex|pre&s;&s;ed any Impatience or Unea&s;ine&s;s at any Accident the Admiral judg|ed to impede his engaging the Enemy properly? <HI>A.</HI> At the Time the Admiral lay a-back, I heard him &s;ay, he wonder'd what the Ships a-head were about. <HI>Q.</HI> While the <HI>Ramillies</HI> continued going down upon the Enemy, did not their Shot reach her and pa&s;s over her? <HI>A.</HI> At the Time the <HI>French</HI> fired at the <HI>Ramillies,</HI> they reached her, pa&s;&s;ed over, and &s;ome hulled her. <HI>Q.</HI> At the Time that the Enemy were firing up|on us, and their Shot pa&s;&s;ing over us, did you hear the Admiral &s;ay any Thing on that Occa&s;ion? <HI>A.</HI> I recollect, that when the <HI>French</HI> were firing upon us, the Admiral de&s;ired Captain <HI>Gardiner</HI> not to fire, till &s;uch Time as we were down along &s;ide of them. <HI>Q.</HI> Did you not inform the Admiral, during the Time of the Firing, that you di&s;cerned thro' the Smoak, one of your Ships clo&s;e under the Starboard Bow; and that if we did not immediately cea&s;e firing, we &s;hould fire into her? <HI>A.</HI> The
<PB N="24" REF="007892_0024_102DF70DA15C0618">
Words I made u&s;e of to the Admiral, as well as I can recollect, were <Q>Do you, or Captain <HI>Gardiner,</HI> &s;ee that Ship upon our Starboard Bow? I apprehend her to be one of ours; if you do not take Care we &s;hall fire into her.</Q> <HI>Q.</HI> Did firing cea&s;e on board the <HI>Ramillies,</HI> as you apprehend, to avoid firing through our own Ship? <HI>A.</HI> Yes. Then Admiral <HI>Byng</HI> delivered &s;ome Que&s;tions to the Pre&s;ident, which he de|&s;ired the Judge Advocate might a&s;k of the Witne&s;s. The Pre&s;ident an&s;wer'd, I will a&s;k them. <HI>Q.</HI> Was you near the Admiral's Per&s;on be|fore, during, and after the Action, and did you ob&s;erve his Behaviour? <HI>A.</HI> I was near him the whole Day of the Action. <HI>Q.</HI> Did you perceive any Backwardne&s;s in the Admiral during the Action, or any Marks of Fear or Confu&s;ion, either from his Countenance or Behaviour? <HI>Q.</HI> He &s;eem'd to me to give his Orders cooly and di&s;tinctly; and I don't ap|prehend he was in the lea&s;t wanting in per&s;onal Courage. <HI>Q.</HI> Did the Admiral appear &s;ollicitous to engage the Enemy, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Ma|je&s;ty's Ships that were engaged with the Enemy? <HI>A.</HI> Yes. <HI>Q.</HI> Did you, on or after the Day of Action, hear any Murmuring or Di&s;content among the Officers or Men, upon any Suppo&s;ition that the Admiral had not done his Duty? <HI>A.</HI> I never heard any one of the <HI>Ramillies</HI> &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of the Admiral.</P>
<P>Col. <HI>Smith,</HI> who was al&s;o upon the Quarter-Deck with the Admiral, confirmed the above in every Particular with this additional Circum|&s;tance, that a Shot from the Enemy pa&s;&s;ed between him and Lord <HI>Ber|tie,</HI> as they were a-ba&s;t the Mainma&s;t, which took off the Head of a Timber upon Deck, and went thro' the Hammocks in the Main Shrouds; &s;aid, the Admiral &s;hewed no Signs of Fear, but quite the Rever&s;e.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Edgar,</HI> who was quartered upon the Poop, confirmed &s;uch of the above Circum&s;tances as came immediately under his own Ob&s;erva|tion; but was not a&s;ked any Que&s;tions relative to the per&s;onal Behaviour of the Admiral, his Situation not giving him an Opportunity of an|&s;wering to the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Col. <HI>Cornwallis,</HI> being &s;worn, &s;aid, that lie was on Board the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> could give no Account of the Action, and was willing to an&s;wer any Que&s;tions the Court demanded, or Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> would propo&s;e; but none were a&s;k'd.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Gough</HI> fir&s;t Lieutenant of the <HI>Ramillies,</HI> being &s;worn, &s;aid, That at the Time of the Signal being made for engaging, the Fleet ap|peared
<PB N="25" REF="007892_0025_102DC79CAB42FB50">
in a clo&s;e and regular Line; that two Ships, which he believed to be the <HI>Trident</HI> and <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> were under their Lee-Bow; could not &s;ay at what Di&s;tance the <HI>Ramillies</HI> was from the Enemy at the Time of the Signal for engaging, being mo&s;tly at his Quarters, but believed when they began to engage, they were nearly at Point-Blank with the Enemy.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Be&s;&s;et,</HI> Second Lieutenant, being quartered upon the Lower-Deck, could not an&s;wer to the Di&s;tance, nor how long they continued firing; &s;aid, that &s;everal of the Enemy's Shot &s;truck the Sides of the <HI>Ramillies;</HI> and one in particular cut one of the Hinges of the Ports clo&s;e to him, but did not afterwards go thro' her Sides; but mu&s;t have done &s;o it had been properly loaded. He al&s;o &s;aid, that as the Enemy's Shot reached the <HI>Ramillies,</HI> he doubted not but her Shot reached them al&s;o.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Welbey,</HI> Third Lieutenant of the <HI>Ramillies,</HI> quartered upon the Middle Deck, &s;aid, that the <HI>Ramillies</HI> was bearing down when the Sig|nal was made; that he was ordered to double-&s;hot the Guns, for the Admiral did not intend to fire all he came clo&s;e up with the Enemy, and confirmed the above Te&s;timony of a Ship or Ships being on their Lee-bow; agreed there was a commanding Breeze, and if all their Sails had been &s;et, they &s;hould have been clo&s;er to the Enemy, and &s;aid, he believed they were within half a Mile of the Enemy.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> the Fourth Lieutenant, was called, but not being on board, Mr. <HI>Waterfall,</HI> the Fifth Lieutenant, was examined, who &s;aid, he was quartered on the Lower-Deck, knew not the Di&s;tance from the Enemy, but apprehended they were within proper Di&s;tance for Engaging; that he received Orders by Lord <HI>Robert Berlie,</HI> to leave off firing on Ac|count of the Ship on the Lee-bow.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the Sixth Lieutenant of the <HI>Ramillies,</HI> who was quar|tered on the upper Gun-Deck, by the Mainma&s;t forward, confirmed the preceeding Te&s;timony chiefly, and &s;aid, when the <HI>Ramillies,</HI> begun to bear down, it might be about two Miles Di&s;tance, and was at the Di&s;|tance of about half a Mile when they began to fire; &s;aid, that thro' the Smoak he di&s;covered the <HI>Trident</HI>'s red Stern, and Part of her blue Co|lours, and that &s;he was then upon her Lee-bow very near.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> 13. Lieut. <HI>Clark</HI> was examined, who&s;e Evidence agreed in general with the other Lieutenants. The Carpenter of the <HI>Intrepid</HI> was &s;worn, and was a&s;ked but one Que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> If he could ju&s;tify the Defects of the Ship, as he had given them in? which he an&s;wering po&s;i|tively in the Affirmative, the Court di&s;charged him.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="007892_0026_102DF70FD20791F0">
The Gunner of the <HI>Ramillies</HI> was examined as to the Powder expen|ded that Day, who an&s;wered 20 Barrels, and 300 double-headed Shot. He was much confu&s;ed, and &s;aid, the <HI>Intrepid</HI> was in their Way, and they could not bear down; but was told, he could not be Judge of that, being quartered on the Lower Gun-Deck. The Carpenter &s;aid, he could give no Account, being at his Duty in the Wings. The Boat&s;wain &s;aid, he was minding his Rigging, and therefore could give no Account of the Matter. The Ma&s;ter gave his Evidence very confu&s;edly, and by &s;aying and un&s;aying, did the Admiral more Detriment than Service.</P>
<P><HI>Friday,</HI> 14. Several Mid&s;hipmen were examined, and the Surgeon of the <HI>Ramillies,</HI> who&s;e Evidence was not very material one way or the other. Capt. <HI>H. Ward,</HI> of the <HI>Culloden,</HI> was likewi&s;e examined, who de|clared, that the Admiral was retarded by backing his Top-&s;ails near or quite half an Hour; and that had the Admiral &s;et more &s;ail at fir&s;t, and bore down upon the Enemy, it was his Opinion, they might have taken every Ship. After him, &s;everal of his Lieutenants were examined, who all depo&s;ed to the very &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday,</HI> 15. Capt. <HI>Perry,</HI> was examined, who&s;e Evidence was near the &s;ame with the re&s;t of the Captains, <HI>viz.</HI> that he thought the Admiral might have carried his Top-gallant Sails that Day.</P>
<P>Here the Evidence for the King was clo&s;ed by the Judge Advocate, and the Court adjourned to <HI>Monday</HI> Morning nine o'Clock, when Ad|miral <HI>Byng</HI> was to begin his Defence.</P>
<P><HI>Monday,</HI> 17. Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> appeared to make his Defence; but nothing material was done.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> 18. Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> delivered his Defence into Court, which was read by the Judge Advocate, in which he took Notice of the many In|dignities which he had undergone, by an enraged and deluded People; that he had been treated like a Felon; had been hanged and burnt in Effigy; his Per&s;on clo&s;ely confined, and the Windows of his Pri&s;on bar|ricaded. He then ob&s;erved to the Court, That he humbly pre&s;umed, no Proof had been given again&s;t him of any unnece&s;&s;ary Delay in the Fleet's &s;ailing to <HI>Minorca,</HI> nor of his di&s;covering any Backwardne&s;s or Signs of Fear, again&s;t engaging the Enemy; therefore moved the Court to give their Opinion thereon, as it might be a Means in &s;aving &s;ome Time in the Cour&s;e of his Defence.</P>
<P><HI>[The Defence is annexed to the Trial.]</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="007892_0027_102DF7128E386180">
The Court was then ordered to be cleared upon this Motion, and in about an Hour and a Half was opened again. The Judge Advocate then read the unanimous Re&s;olution of the Court; which was, That they could not give any Opinion till the Witne&s;&s;es in his Defence were examined. Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> then called Capt. <HI>Gardiner</HI> again, and a&s;ked ma|ny Que&s;tions, mo&s;t of which being Matter of Opinion, he begged Leave to refer them to the Court. Capt. <HI>Gardiner</HI>'s Cro&s;s-Examination being gone through, the Court a&s;ked Mr. <HI>Byng,</HI> Who he &s;hould have Occa&s;ion to call To-morrow? He replied, Capt, <HI>Ambur&s;t, Hervey</HI> and <HI>Phillips.</HI> The Court then adjourned till next Morning.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> 19. Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> delivered a Paper, declaring he had no more Evidence to produce but his Secretary, and would give the Court no farther Trouble; and likewi&s;e &s;aid, That his not going down to en|gage the Enemy, was not owing to his Want of Courage, but mu&s;t be an Error in his Judgment. The Admiral having nothing more to &s;ay in his Defence, the Court clo&s;ed. The next Morning the Members of the Court met, in order to revi&s;e the Evidence that had been given by the Witne&s;&s;es during the Cour&s;e of this long Trial, to con&s;ider the Strength of the Proofs for and again&s;t him, and to pa&s;s &s;uch an equitable Sentence as might do Ju&s;tice both to their Country and the Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Full eight Days were taken up in canva&s;&s;ing the Proceedings; and the Variety of the Evidence gave Occa&s;ion for &s;everal warm Debates a|mong them, and they were a good while divided in their Opinions as to his Guilt or Innocence. Five of them found him guilty of the whole Charge, and con&s;equently that he ought to &s;uffer Death. Four of them were only for breaking him, and thought the Lo&s;s of his Commi&s;&s;ion was a &s;ufficient Puni&s;hment. And four of them were for entirely acquit|ting him. But as they could not deviate from the Articles of War, &s;et|tled by Act of Parliament, they at length unanimou&s;ly agreed to Thirty-Six Re&s;olutions. <HI>[See</HI> Page 34. <HI>after the Admiral's Defence.]</HI></P>
<P>The following Letters were &s;ent to the Secretary's Office, who tran&s;|mitted them to the Pre&s;ident of the Court-Martial at <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> The fir&s;t was wrote in Engli&s;h by the celebrated M. <HI>Voltaire,</HI> and directed to Admiral <HI>Byng.</HI> The other the Tran&s;lation of a Letter in French from the Mar&s;hal D. <HI>Richlieu,</HI> and &s;ent to M. <HI>Voltaire.</HI> But with what View they were wrote is not ea&s;y to be conceived. Surely the&s;e Gentlemen mu&s;t have very mean and unworthy Notions of Engli&s;h Equity and Ju&s;tice, to &s;uppo&s;e that his Judges would condemn him, unle&s;s on the
<PB N="28" REF="007892_0028_102DF714B79E20F0">
Te&s;timony of unexceptionable Evidence; or that they were not as in|clinable to acquit as to puni&s;h him. Or, rather, is it not a <HI>French</HI> Ga&s;|conade, to magnify the Bravery of their Fleet, and banter the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for their Folly and Temerity in pretending to cope with a Power &s;o much their &s;uperior? In whatever Light we view the&s;e Letters, we plainly di&s;cover the Impertinence and In&s;ult of their Writers. If the <HI>French</HI> were really victorious, as the Mar&s;hal has the Front to affirm, how came they to quit the Field of Battle, and not return to &s;ee what was become of their Enemy? Or, for what other Rea&s;on than their Mi&s;behaviour in the Engagement, did they break four of their Captains immediately on their Arrival at <HI>Mar&s;eilles?</HI> But let the Reader judge for him&s;elf, after he has peru&s;ed the two following Letters.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am very &s;en&s;ibly concerned for Admiral <HI>Byng:</HI> I do a&s;&s;ure you whatever I have &s;een or heard of him does him Honour. After having done all that Man could rea&s;onably expect from him, he ought not to be cen&s;ured for &s;uffering a Defeat. When two Commanders contend for Victory, though both are equally Men of Ho|nour, yet one mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be wor&s;ted, and there is nothing again&s;t Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> but his being wor&s;ted; for his whole Conduct was that of an able Seaman, and is ju&s;tly worthy of Admiration. The Strength of the two Fleets was at lea&s;t equal; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had thirteen Ships, and we twelve much better furni&s;hed and much cleaner. Fortune that pre&s;ides over all Battles, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are fought at Sea, was more favourable to us than our Adver&s;aries, by &s;ending our Balls into their Ships with greater Execution. I am per&s;uaded, and it is the general received O|pinion, that if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had ob&s;tinately continued the Engagement, their whole Fleet would have been de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there can be no higher Act of Inju&s;tice than what is new attempted a|gain&s;t Admiral <HI>Byng,</HI> and all Men of Honour, and all Gentlemen of the Army, are particularly intere&s;ted in the Event.</P>
