<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following e&s;&s;ay is the fruit of &s;ome &s;olitary hours, penned and publi&s;hed with a &s;incere de&s;ire for the reformation of the &s;e|veral cla&s;&s;es of mankind, who are immer&s;ed in vice and &s;en&s;uality,&mdash; of the de&s;igning and knavi&s;h,&mdash;and the &s;tability of every virtuous, and ingenious per&s;on.</P>
<P>The manner in which I have thrown my thoughts together, &s;eemed to occur the mo&s;t ea&s;y, and for &s;ome rea&s;ons appeared to me the mo&s;t eligible.</P>
<P>I am not &s;o vain as to imagine my performance is free from inac|curacies; but &s;uch errors as have either e&s;caped my notice, or are be|yond my weak abilities to amend, I hope my <HI>Candid Reader</HI> will correct and excu&s;e.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who ventures out on the public Stage as an author, be|comes of cour&s;e &s;ubject to the various critici&s;ms of his ob&s;ervers; the keen invectives of &s;atire, and the poi&s;oned arrows of envy, are illibe|rally dealt again&s;t his character and productions.&mdash;The&s;e I am pre|pared to receive, with a contempt due to the efforts of malevolence; and, at the &s;ame time, &s;hall not forget to pay a proper re&s;pect and deference to the critici&s;ms of candour and ingenuity.</P>
<P>The poem before you, contains neither the Life nor Opinions of Tri|&s;tram Shandy, the Memoirs of a Gentleman of Plea&s;ure, or the Amours of a Lady of Quality.&mdash;A piece, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, not &s;o well adapted to the genius of the pre&s;ent age; an age, in which &s;ubjects &s;erious, important and intere&s;ting, can &s;carce obtain a hearing, are treated with indifference, and forgot, whil&s;t their authors are ridi|culed as fools, or pitied as enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="010355_0003_0F7EA254C1B3C2B0">To treat of the Deity, his attributes, the relation we &s;tand in to him, and the indi&s;pen&s;able obligation of &s;ocial and religious duties,&mdash; to excite con&s;iderations on the uncertainty of time, the certainty of death, and the awful approaching deci&s;ion of infinite wi&s;dom and pu|rity, with a certain cla&s;s of mankind, are deemed enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pecu|lations, and idle reveries;&mdash;the certain &s;pecimens of either ignorance, a heated zeal, or of incurable madne&s;s. A cla&s;s, who&punc; to avoid the extreme of &s;uper&s;tition and fanatici&s;m, have incautiou&s;ly run into ano|ther &s;till more alarming and dangerous, from the borders of Implicit Faith to the confines of Infidelity, from a fal&s;e heated zeal to the colde&s;t indifference, and from the au&s;terities of a penance to the mo&s;t relaxed licentious indulgence. Be ours to walk in the happy medium of truth, and of right rea&s;on; the medium between the zeal-le&s;s and zealot, or indifference and pre&s;umption; and let the deluded of both extremes become the objects of our pity, and be remembered in our prayers.</P>
<P>You of every rank, degree, and circum&s;tance in life, into who&s;e hand this may fall, as rational and accountable beings, improve the few, fleeting moments of your continuance in this mode of exi&s;tence, in matters of infinite con&s;equence; con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly the important bu&s;ine&s;s of life, acquaint your&s;elves with the various branches of a Chri&s;tian's duty, and di&s;charge them with integrity.</P>
<P>Remember time is &s;hort; life altogether uncertain; and that death is inevitable. The time is approaching, when the &s;able mantle of af|fliction will be ca&s;t over all the pomp of a court, the glitter of a ball, and the ludicrous &s;cenes of a comedy. The period, the awful period is ha&s;tening, when from life will be exhau&s;ted all its balm, and from terre&s;trial objects their power of plea&s;ing &mdash; when every enjoyment will become in&s;ipid, except the complacent notice of <HI>uncreated excellence,</HI> the te&s;timony of a good <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> and the a&s;&s;urance of a happy futurity. Devote then your days, &s;hould they be few or many, to the &s;ervice of <HI>Him,</HI> who hath called us to glory and virtue. Let not the enchanting &s;cene of illu&s;ive plea&s;ures, the influence of bad example, or the incitement of the libertine, prevail on you to run with the heedle&s;s multitude to do evil; walk pen&s;ive with the few on the &s;ide of virtue, acquit your&s;elves as men, and as Chri&s;tians, and the lot of your inheritance will be with the ju&s;t;&mdash;for, <HI>Verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily there is a God who judgeth the earth.</HI></P>

<L>THE clock &s;trikes five&mdash;the fiery orb appears;</L>

<L>Darts lucid gleams throughout the atmo&s;phere,</L>
<L>And bids depart the &s;hadows of the night.</L>

<L>No cloud is &s;een, throughout the wide expan&s;e</L>
<L>Of Heaven's arched vault; the vapour den&s;e</L>
<L>A&s;cending from the valleys, mar&s;hy &s;wamps,</L>

<L>Of yonder eminence, and there recline</L>
<L>Upon the verdant ridge, ba&s;k in the blaze</L>
