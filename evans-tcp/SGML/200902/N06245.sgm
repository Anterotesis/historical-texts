<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>May it plea&s;e your</HI> HONOUR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN Pur&s;uance of your In&s;tructions, as &s;oon as I was informed of the <HI>Indians</HI> being come to <HI>John Harris</HI>'s, I &s;et off from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to meet them, and arrived at <HI>John Harris</HI>'s the 29th of <HI>March, 1757,</HI> where I met about One Hundred and Sixty <HI>Indians,</HI> Men, Women and Children, Part of eight Tribes.</P>
<P>The Thirtieth, I examined <HI>Jo&s;eph Peepy,</HI> and <HI>Lewis Montour,</HI> in regard to the Me&s;&s;ages I had &s;ent by them to the <HI>Sa&s;quchannah Indians.</HI></P>
<P>They informed me, that <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> was gone to the <HI>Seneca</HI> Country, to get a Number of the <HI>Senecas</HI> to come down with him; and they delivered me a Belt of Wampum &s;ent me by <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> in Return of mine &s;ent him by them; by which Belt he informs me, that he will be down as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, with Two Hundred <HI>Indians,</HI> but could not tell, whether he would come in at <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> or at <HI>John Harris</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The remaining Part of this Day I &s;pent in getting what Intelligence I could of the Strength of the <HI>French</HI> on <HI>Ohio,</HI> and the Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e;</HI> and by the be&s;t Accounts I can get, I find the <HI>French</HI> have not had above Three Hundred Men in Garri&s;on at <HI>Ohio</HI> this Winter, and that the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> on <HI>Ohio</HI> were divided among&s;t them&s;elves, one Half of each Tribe going down <HI>Ohio</HI> to where the Lower <HI>Shawa|ne&s;e</HI> are &s;ettled, and the other Half were determined to go off to the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P>I am informed, that all the <HI>Sa&s;quehanna Indians</HI> are di&s;po&s;ed for Peace, except the <HI>Mun&s;eys,</HI> or <HI>Mini&s;ink Indians;</HI> yet I under&s;tand that a Number of them will be down with <HI>Teedyu&s;cung.</HI></P>
<P>I am informed, by a <HI>Six Nation Indian,</HI> one of Reputation among&s;t them, that re&s;ided at <HI>Diahago,</HI> that as &s;oon as <HI>Jo&s;eph Peepy</HI> and <HI>Lewis Montour</HI> had delivered their Me&s;&s;age there, the Council, that Night, di&s;patched two Men to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> to inform the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> living there, of this Meeting, de&s;iring &s;ome of them to come to it; but if none of them &s;hould chu&s;e to come, the&s;e Me&s;&s;engers were then to in&s;i&s;t that none of the <HI>Dela|wares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> living on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> &s;hould come to War again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> till this Meeting was over, and they have Time, after returning Home, to let them know how it ended:</P>

<P>I AM &s;ent here by the Honourable Sir WILLIAM JOHNSON, to repre&s;ent him at this Meeting; and I de&s;ire you all to give Attention to what I am going to &s;ay to you in Be|half of your Brother <HI>Onas</HI> and the wi&s;e Men of this Government, who are truly &s;en&s;ible of your Afflictions, occa&s;ioned by the Death of many of your Coun&s;ellors and Warriors, &s;ince they had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you in this Government; and as they have ever looked upon your Misfortunes as their own, they mix their Tears with yours, and have de&s;ired me to condole with you, agreeable to the antient Cu&s;tom of our Forefathers.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this Belt of Wampum I wipe the Blood off the Seats round your Council Fire, that your old Men at this critical Juncture, when convened in Council, may &s;it with Comfort, and direct their Warriors with Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As I have wiped the Blood off the Seats round your Council Fire, I, with the&s;e Strouds, wrap up the Bodies of your decea&s;ed Friends, and bury them decently, covering their Graves with the&s;e Blankets and Halfthicks.</P>
<P><HI>Gave the Goods.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As the Blood is wiped off the Seats of your Coun&s;ellors, the Dead decently buried, and their Graves covered, I, with this Belt of Wampum, wipe the Tears from your Eyes, and de&s;ire you may mourn no more.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As you are now out of Mourning, I with this Belt of Wampum di&s;per&s;e the dark Clouds which are gathered over your Heads, that you may &s;ee the Sun clear, and &s;hake Hands with your Brethren when you meet in Council.</P>

<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>

<P><HI>Sachems and Warriors of the</HI> Six United Nations, <HI>our Friends and Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I embrace this Opportunity of acquainting you, that la&s;t Year your Brother <HI>Onas</HI> held two Conferences at <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> with your Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and your Brethren the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> that live on <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> in order to &s;ettle the Differences &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them and us; but as that good Work could not be accompli&s;hed at that Time, they agreed to have a Meet|ing this Spring to finally &s;ettle all Differences &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them and us their Brethren: And that this Meeting might be the more general, I di&s;patched Me&s;&s;engers up <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> and to <HI>Ohio,</HI> and I wrote to your Brother, Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> de&s;iring him to reque&s;t a Number of you our Brethren, the <HI>Six United Nations,</HI> to be pre&s;ent at this Meeting, who I am heartily glad to &s;ee here; and when your Nephews and Brothers arrive, I am in great Hopes, by your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to be able to accommodate Matters to the mutual Satisfaction of both them and us their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the &s;everal Governments.</P>
<P>And by this Belt of Wampum, I reque&s;t you to make u&s;e of all your Intere&s;t with your Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and Brothers the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> to bring about an Accommodation between them and us, that the Sun may once more &s;hine upon us in Peace, and that the Peace may la&s;t as long as the Sun, the Moon and the Stars give Light.</P>

<P>YOU and our Brother <HI>Onas</HI> wi&s;ely con&s;idered the antient Cu&s;tom of our Forefathers, in condoling with us, and mixing your Grief with ours: And as we make no Doubt but &s;ome of your wi&s;e Coun&s;ellors are dead &s;ince we were here, and many of our Brethren have been killed by the evil Spirit, we wipe the Blood off your Council Seats, and put them in Order with this Belt of Wampum.</P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>After wiping the Blood off your Council-Seats, we, with the&s;e few Skins, wrap up the Bones of our Brethren that died or were killed by the evil Spirit, and cover their Graves.</P>

This Evening I had a Meeting of the Sachems, and propo&s;ed the Going to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to hold the Treaty; but I could prevail on none of them, except the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> to go there; the re&s;t were afraid of Sickne&s;s.</P>
<P>When I found they were not to be prevailed on to go there, I called a Council, and, with a Belt of Wampum, I removed the Council Fire to <HI>Lanca&s;ter;</HI> to which Place they all agreed to go, and wait the Arrival of <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> with the <HI>Senecas, Delawares,</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt, to remove the Council Fire to</HI> Lanca&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the 7th, I arrived at <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> from <HI>John Harris</HI>'s; from whence Mr. <HI>Shippen,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomp&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Boude,</HI> and Captain <HI>Cane,</HI> with a Number of other Gentlemen, Inhabitants of that Borough, went out with me to meet the <HI>Indians</HI> (who I had left a few Miles behind) to bid them welcome to <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>Indians</HI> were &s;ettled at the Place taken for them by <HI>James Wright,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> I then kindled a &s;mall Fire for them to &s;it by till they &s;hould hear from their Brother <HI>Onas</HI> of the Arrival of <HI>Teedyu&s;cung.</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the 10th, I received a Letter from his Honour the Governor, acquainting me of the Arrival of Fifty <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> at <HI>Fort-Allen,</HI> and that they were ordered to wait there the Arrival of <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> with the re&s;t of the <HI>Indians</HI> who were coming with him.</P>
<P>I immediately ordered a Meeting of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and acquainted them with what the Go|vernor had wrote me about the Arrival of the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> at <HI>Fort-Allen,</HI> which was very agreeable to them.</P>
<P>I then acquainted them, by a Belt of Wampum, that their Brother <HI>Onas</HI> had prepared a very convenient Place for them within a Mile of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and that he propo&s;ed to hold the Conference at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> as Teedyu&s;cung had, at the la&s;t Treaty at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> given his Ho|nour the Governor a Promi&s;e to come to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> this Spring.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Indians, <HI>after con&s;idering what had been &s;aid to them, returned the following An&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have con&s;idered what you &s;aid to us from our Brother <HI>Onas;</HI> when you propo&s;ed to us, at <HI>John Harris</HI>'s, to go to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> we refu&s;ed for the Rea&s;ons we then gave you. By the Me&s;&s;age you &s;ent us by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"></HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words">,</HI> we under&s;tood that the <HI>De|lawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> were to fix the Place of Meeting where they thought proper.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We tell you we will &s;it where we are till they arrive and fix the Place of Meeting with our Brother <HI>Onas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Returned the Belt of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the 11th, I delivered the Goods purcha&s;ed by <HI>James Wright,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of Mr. <HI>James Webb,</HI> which was well received by them.</P>
<P>After the Goods were divided, the Chiefs of the &s;everal Tribes came in a Body, and return|ed Thanks to the Government for the Cloathing they had received.</P>
<P>The 13th, the &s;everal Chiefs came to me, and told me, they ob&s;erved that I gave no Cloathing to our Brothers the <HI>Conne&s;togoes,</HI> and de&s;ired that I would give them &s;ome, el&s;e they &s;hould be obliged to give them Part of what had been given them.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P>The 17th, I called a Meeting of all the <HI>Indians,</HI> and returned them Thanks for condoling with me at <HI>John Harris</HI>'s for the Lo&s;s we their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had &s;u&s;tained by Death and the evil Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I return you Thanks for mixing your Grief with ours, and wiping the Blood off our Coun|cil Seats.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I give you Thanks for wrapping up the Bones of our decea&s;ed Brothers, and covering the Graves, and wiping the Tears from our Eyes.</P>

<P>I return you Thanks for di&s;per&s;ing the dark Clouds from over our Heads, for healing our Hearts, and freeing our Minds from Trouble, and for brightening the Chain of Friend&s;hip made by our Forefathers.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the 20th, I received a Letter from his Honour Governor <HI>Denny,</HI> inclo&s;ing two Me&s;&s;ages from <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> to the Governor, which were delivered to Major <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> in <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> and forwarded by him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I received his Honour's Letter, I called a Meeting of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and repeated over to them the Me&s;&s;ages, and let them know, that <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI>'s being &s;o long detained on the Way was the Scarcity of Provi&s;ions; and then acquainted them, that his Honour the Gover|nor had ordered a Supply to be &s;ent to meet them, for which the <HI>Indians</HI> returned his Ho|nour the Governor their hearty Thanks, and &s;aid, their Brother <HI>Onas</HI>'s &s;ending Provi&s;ions to meet their Cou&s;ins on the Road, was giving them the &s;tronge&s;t A&s;&s;urances of his Regard and E&s;teem for them.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the 23d, Six <HI>Onondago</HI> Warriors applied to me for Liberty to go to <HI>Fort Cumberland,</HI> to join the Southward <HI>Indians,</HI> who they under&s;tood were going to War again&s;t His Maje&s;ty's Enemies at <HI>Ohio;</HI> I granted their Reque&s;t, and fitted them out for their Journey.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the 26th, <HI>Scarroyady,</HI> with a Party of <HI>Mohawk</HI> Warriors, came and told me that they were apprehen&s;ive the <HI>French</HI> would make &s;ome Attempt again&s;t <HI>Fort-Augu&s;ta,</HI> and de&s;ired I would fit them out to go there; to which I agreed, giving them Orders to reconnoitre the adjacent Woods, for a few Days, then to proceed towards the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and to reconnoitre the Country well as they went, and if they di&s;covered any Body of <HI>French,</HI> or Parties of <HI>Indians,</HI> coming towards <HI>Fort-Augu&s;ta,</HI> or any Part of this or the neighbouring Governments, they were immediately to return and give Notice to the Commanding Officer at <HI>Fort-Augu&s;ta,</HI> or to the Commanding Officer of the Fort nighe&s;t to that Part of the Country where they &s;hould come into.</P>
<P>The 26th of <HI>April, P. M.</HI> the Chiefs of the &s;everal Tribes called a Meeting, and &s;ent for me, and de&s;ired to know what Time they might expect their Brother <HI>Onas</HI> up, and their Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and Brothers the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> to hold the Conference.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wered, I had not yet received any certain Account of the Arrival of the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e;</HI> and until the Governor had fixed the Place and Time of Meet|ing with <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> I could not give them a full An&s;wer.</P>
<P>To which <HI>Little Abraham,</HI> a <HI>Mohaw<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Sachem, &s;poke as follows, in Behalf of the Whole.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have been here a great while, and the Spring is coming on fa&s;t: It is Time for us to think of going Home to plant. We have heard what you have &s;aid to us from our Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> both at <HI>John Harris</HI>'s and here, that our Brother <HI>Onas</HI> propo&s;ed to hold the Treaty at <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> Every Time you &s;poke to us upon that Head, we gave you our Objections again&s;t going &s;o far down, which we expected would have been con&s;idered before now; but as our Brother <HI>Onas</HI> has not yet agreed to come here, we have determined in our own Minds to treat with our Brother <HI>Onas</HI> here, and go no further down the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have appointed three Men to go to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to &s;peak with our Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> and reque&s;t of him to come up, and we de&s;ire you will find Hor&s;es for them to ride down, and a Man to go with them to the Governor.</P>
<P>And we have appointed three more to go and meet our Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and Bro|thers the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> and bring them here, and we de&s;ire you will find them Hor&s;es, and a Man to go and take Care of them, and provide Nece&s;&s;aries for them on the Road.</P>

<P><HI>May</HI> the 6th, I called a Meeting of the Chiefs of the &s;everal Tribes, when <HI>William Logan,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Member of his Honour the Governor's Council, returned the Governor's An&s;wer to the Me&s;&s;age &s;ent him by <HI>Thomas King,</HI> and <HI>Rut King.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the Deputies of the</HI> Six United Nations, <HI>and your Cou&s;ins and Brethren the</HI> Delawares.</P>
<P>I am &s;ent to you by your Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> as a Member of his Council, and your very good Friend, and I de&s;ire you will attend to what I am now going to &s;ay to you, and con&s;ider my Words as if they were &s;poken by <HI>Onas</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>A few Days &s;ince, <HI>Thomas King,</HI> and <HI>Rut King,</HI> accompanied by <HI>Thomas M'Kee,</HI> as their Guide, came to me in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and informed me, by this Belt of Wampum, that you held a Council Fire at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and had &s;ent for our Friend <HI>George Croghan</HI> to it, and had made a Speech to him; in which you acquainted him, that on his Invitation you came to <HI>John Harris</HI>'s, under&s;tanding the Council Fire was to be kindled there; that after you had &s;taid there &s;ome Time, you were de&s;ired to accompany him to <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and that I would meet you there; that therefore you had appointed the&s;e two <HI>Indians</HI> to wait on me, and to take me by the Hand, and invite me to your Council; that you had determined among your|&s;elves to come no further, and would be glad to &s;ee me, and that my coming would rejoice your Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You mu&s;t be very &s;en&s;ible, that in the tran&s;acting Publick Affairs, in the&s;e trouble&s;ome Times, many Difficulties and unfore&s;een Accidents happen which require my particular At|tendance in <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> this is my pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. And as <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> the Chief of the <HI>Delawares,</HI> our Countryman, and your Cou&s;in, with &s;ome other Chiefs and Head Men of that Nation, has &s;ent me lately a Me&s;&s;age, acquainting me, that he was on his Way, with a great Number of <HI>Indians,</HI> coming to meet me, in order to fini&s;h the Treaty of Peace begun la&s;t Year by our late Governor and my&s;elf with the &s;aid Chiefs, and de&s;ired me to be ready with my Coun&s;ellors to a&s;&s;i&s;t in fini&s;hing the &s;aid Treaty which was &s;o happily begun, and that I would be &s;o kind as to &s;end for <HI>Mo&s;es Tatamy,</HI> and <HI>John Pump&s;hire</HI> (two <HI>Delaware In|dian</HI> Interpreters) from the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> to be pre&s;ent; and that as there was &s;o great a Number of <HI>Indians</HI> who were coming with him, they would want Provi&s;ions on their Way, and de&s;ired I would &s;end &s;ome to <HI>Wyoming</HI> for them, which I immediately complied with. The&s;e, Brethren, have been the Rea&s;ons for my delaying my Journey to meet you at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and for my de&s;iring <HI>George Croghan</HI> would endeavour to prevail on you our Brethren to come to the Council Fire at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where the old wi&s;e People, who are your hearty Friends, would have been exceeding glad to &s;ee you; and as I have heard nothing from <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> very lately, I am unea&s;y left &s;ome Accident has happened to him. I thank you very kindly for your affectionate Invitation: I accept of it, and will, with great Plea&s;ure, come and con|&s;ult with you at your Council Fire at <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 9th, three of the Me&s;&s;engers I &s;ent to the <HI>Ohio</HI> returned, and make the following Report.</P>
<P>That on their Arrival at <HI>Venango</HI> (an old <HI>Indian</HI> Town) on <HI>Ohio,</HI> they found &s;everal of the <HI>Delawares</HI> there, one, named <HI>Ca&s;talago,</HI> their Chief. They immediately called a Meet|ing, and delivered the Speeches &s;ent by them, which were very well received by the <HI>Dela|wares;</HI> who told them, in An&s;wer, That they would accept of the Invitation, and come down with them; but that they mu&s;t fir&s;t go and con&s;ult their Uncles the <HI>Senecas,</HI> who lived further up the River. The next Day they &s;et off to a little Town further up the River <HI>Ohio,</HI> where they &s;ummoned a Number of the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Senecas</HI> together. After repeating the Me&s;&s;ages over, one of the <HI>Senecas,</HI> named <HI>Gari&s;tagee,</HI> one of the Chiefs, &s;aid to the <HI>De|lawares;</HI> Nephews, You mu&s;t not accept of that Call, for the Belts which are &s;ent you are not proper Belts on this Occa&s;ion. I know <HI>George Croghan</HI> very well, and would be very glad to &s;ee him; and if he will &s;end a proper Belt, with Men wrought in it, for the &s;everal Tribes he wants to meet with (him&s;elf taking us by the Hand) made of old Council Wam|pum, which is the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, I will go down with you and &s;ee him: To which the <HI>Delawares</HI> agreed, and then returned the Belts.</P>
<P>They &s;ay that one of the Me&s;&s;engers proceeded further, to where the <HI>Delawares,</HI> that lived formerly at <HI>Kittanning,</HI> were now &s;ettled, on <HI>Beaver-Creek,</HI> with a View of finding out the Di&s;|po&s;itions
<PB N="9" REF="007920_0008_102E016FA6546890">of them; and they expect he will be &s;oon down, if not killed. The&s;e Me&s;&s;engers &s;ay, that there were but fifteen <HI>Frenchmen</HI> at <HI>Venango,</HI> and that the Fort there is very weak; and that the <HI>Indians</HI> in them Parts are very much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>They &s;ay that the <HI>Ohio Indians</HI> are much afraid of the Southern <HI>Indians,</HI> having been &s;truck three Times by them this Spring, twice near <HI>Fort Du Que&s;ne,</HI> and once at the <HI>Logs-Town;</HI> and that the <HI>Indians</HI> are moving fa&s;t up the <HI>Ohio</HI> towards the <HI>Senecas.</HI></P>
<P>They heard from the <HI>Indians</HI> there, that the <HI>French</HI> were defeated at <HI>Fort William-Henry,</HI> and that there was another Party defeated by Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> at the <HI>German-Flats;</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> were determined yet to make another Trial again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but that they could not tell where they intended to &s;trike next.</P>
<P>They &s;ay the two Men killed at Fort <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> were killed by the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> which was the only Party of <HI>Delawares</HI> or <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> that has come again&s;t us this Spring; that the other Parties that have been on the Frontiers of this and the neighbouring Provinces, were <HI>Indians</HI> from over the Lakes; that the <HI>Delawares</HI> made great Game of the Lake <HI>In|dians,</HI> and told tho&s;e Me&s;&s;engers, that one Party of them, who had been down, had, on their Return, killed and eat three of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners, for want of Food; that there was an Account came there whil&s;t they were at <HI>Venango,</HI> that the <HI>French Conewagas</HI> had differed with the <HI>French,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> would not &s;upply them with Provi&s;ions; the Difference ro&s;e &s;o high at la&s;t, that they came to Blows; that Sixty of the <HI>Conewagas</HI> were killed, and a great Number of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>I quere the Truth of this News, as the <HI>French</HI> undoubtedly know their Intere&s;t too well to differ with the <HI>Conewagas</HI> at this Time.</P>
<P>The&s;e Me&s;&s;engers, on their Return, touched at <HI>Diabogo,</HI> where they met with <HI>Teedyu&s;|cung,</HI> who enquired of them what they had been doing at <HI>Ohio;</HI> they repeated over to him the Me&s;&s;ages that had been &s;ent by them from this Government, and the An&s;wer they had received from the <HI>Ohio Indians;</HI> on which <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;ent the following Me&s;&s;age by them to their Brother <HI>Onas</HI> and me.</P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>YOU have been at a great deal of Trouble in &s;ending Me&s;&s;ages to us, your Brothers the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e;</HI> but the Per&s;ons you employed are young Warriors, and not Coun&s;ellors, there&s;ore un&s;it for &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s; likewi&s;e the Belts you have &s;ent, in Com|pari&s;on, are no more than Strings; but if you will &s;end to call us together, and &s;end proper Belts, and wi&s;e Men to take us by the Hand, we will come down with them, and give you a Meeting. In which Meeting I hope we &s;hall &s;ettle all Differences &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us; and I a&s;&s;ure you, by this Belt of Wampum, that our Minds are well di&s;po&s;ed, and that our Hearts are warm and true towards you our Brothers the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and we de&s;ire that you, as Me&s;&s;engers from our Brothers, may take this Belt to Capt. <HI>Thomas M'Kee,</HI> and let him deliver it in our Name to our Brother <HI>Onas</HI> and <HI>George Croghan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gave the Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brothers</HI></P>
<P>There is one Thing that gives us a great deal of Concern, which is, our Fle&s;h and Blood that lives among you at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and in the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> being kept as if they were Pri&s;oners. We formerly applied to the Mini&s;ter at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> to let our People come back at Times and hunt, which is the chief Indu&s;try we follow to maintain our Families; but that Mini&s;ter has not li&s;tened to what we have &s;aid to him, and it is very hard that our People have not the Liberty of coming back to the Woods, where Game is plenty, and to &s;ee their Friends.</P>
<P>They have complained to us, that they cannot hunt where they are; and if they go into the Woods, and cut down a Tree, they are abu&s;ed for it, notwith&s;tanding that very Land we look upon to be our own; and we hope, Brothers, that you will con&s;ider this Matter, and let our People come into the Woods, and vi&s;it their Friends, and pa&s;s and repa&s;s, as Brothers ought to do.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>

<P>On opening the Meeting, his Honour the Governor a&s;ked me, as I repre&s;ented the Honour|able Sir WILLIAM JOHNSON at this Treaty, if I was provided with a Secretary: Upon an&s;wering I was provided with one, his Honour then gave Orders that no Per&s;on el&s;e &s;hould take any Notes.</P>
<P><HI>Then the Governor made the following Speech.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> United Nations,</P>
<P>YOU are &s;en&s;ible of the unhappy Differences that have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome Time pa&s;t be|tween us, the People of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the &s;everal Colonies, and our Brethren and Countrymen, the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> your Nephews and Brothers.</P>
<P>By the Mediation of Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> His Maje&s;ty's &s;ole Agent and Superintendent of <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs for the Northern Di&s;trict of <HI>America,</HI> a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms was agreed upon, and they, at a Conference held in <HI>Ot&s;aningo,</HI> promi&s;ed to lay down their Hatchet; which A|greement they &s;ince ratified and confirmed in another Conference with that Gentleman in your Pre&s;ence; at which Time Sir <HI>William</HI> de&s;ired to know what was the Cau&s;e of their com|mitting Ho&s;tilities on their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which Que&s;tion they did not then give a full An&s;wer to. But at a &s;ub&s;equent Treaty with me at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, the &s;ame Que|&s;tion being put to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> he frankly acknowledged that their fooli&s;h young Men, being deluded by our Enemy, the fal&s;e hearted <HI>French</HI> King, were per&s;waded to take up the Hatchet again&s;t us. This, he &s;aid, was the fir&s;t and principal Cau&s;e; but that one Rea&s;on why the Blow fell the heavier on us was, that their Brother <HI>Onas</HI> had fraudulently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of &s;ome of their Lands, without having fir&s;t purcha&s;ed, or given any Con&s;ideration for them.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of nine Rows.</HI></P>
<P>Being very de&s;irous that all Cau&s;es of Di&s;content &s;hould be removed, I propo&s;ed that the Matter &s;hould then be finally accommodated; but <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> declaring, that he was not &s;uf|ficienty
<PB N="11" REF="007920_0010_102E0172EAD41C80">impowered to fini&s;h that Bu&s;ine&s;s, declined it, and de&s;ired another Meeting this Spring, when he engaged to bring with him tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> to whom the &s;aid Lands belonged, at which Time this Complaint might be fully heard, and amicably adju&s;ted.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of nine Rows.</HI></P>
<P>Having the greate&s;t Confidence in the Friend&s;hip and Ju&s;tice of our Brethren the <HI>Six Na|tions,</HI> I immediately acquainted Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> with the&s;e Proceedings, and reque&s;ted that he would be plea&s;ed to &s;end &s;ome of the wi&s;e Men of tho&s;e Nations to be pre&s;ent and a&s;&s;i&s;t at the propo&s;ed Meeting. I expected <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> would have been here before this Time, and am greatly concerned at his Stay.</P>
<P>It would afford me great Satisfaction, if it had &s;uited your Conveniency to wait his Arrival; but as you have informed me your Bu&s;ine&s;s will not admit of being longer ab&s;ent from your Country, if you can now think of any Mea&s;ure that may be likely to promote the good Work in which we are engaged, and e&s;tabli&s;h a firm and la&s;ting Friend&s;hip between us and your Nephews, you &s;hall find me &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to join with you in doing every Thing in my Power conducive to &s;o de&s;irable an End.

<P>AFTER you had done &s;peaking to us Ye&s;terday, you left the Appointing the Time for the next Meeting to us. We are now met in Council, and I de&s;ire you to li&s;ten to what we are going to &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas King</HI> then got up, and repeated over the two fir&s;t Speeches made to them by the Governor Ye&s;terday, and returned his Honour Thanks, for acquainting them with the par|ticular Circum&s;tances that happened during the Cour&s;e of the Conference at <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> la&s;t Fall, between his Honour and the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e;</HI> and expre&s;&s;ed the great Satisfaction it gave them to hear that their Brother <HI>Onas</HI> was to fortunate as to find out the true Cau&s;es from whence the Difference aro&s;e between their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and their Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and their Brothers the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> for that they had taken a great Deal of Pains to find it out without Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas</HI> then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Governor, and &s;aid, he hoped, that if they &s;hould make any Blunders, or have forgot any Part of the Speech, he would excu&s;e them, as they could not write; therefore were obliged to keep every Thing in their Memory.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Little Abraham</HI> then de&s;ired the Governor to give Attention, as they were going to return an An&s;wer to his Honour's la&s;t Speech; and after he had repeated over the la&s;t Speech deli|vered them by the Governor Ye&s;terday, he &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You de&s;ired our Advice in Regard to the Differences that aro&s;e between you and our Ne|phews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and Brothers the <HI>Shawane&s;e;</HI> and you de&s;ired us to give you our Opi|nion
<PB N="12" REF="007920_0011_102E01752C020978">which would be the be&s;t Method now to pur&s;ue to bring about an Accommodation: We have con&s;idered what you required of us. Brothers, We are di&s;appointed, by the Heads of our Relations not coming to this Meeting; it was on their Account that we met our Brothers at this Time.&mdash;If they had come here at this Time, we &s;hould have &s;at &s;till, and heard the Complaints on each Side, then we &s;hould have been the better able to judge who was in the Fault, and would have given our Opinion freely: However, as Things now &s;tand, we mu&s;t inform you, our Brothers, That in the Time of our Great-Grand-Fathers, and when the <HI>Six Nations</HI> fir&s;t united, it was agreed that the <HI>Seneca</HI> Country &s;hould be the Door to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> into which all Me&s;&s;engers &s;hould pa&s;s in Time of War, and there deliver their Me&s;&s;ages, and the <HI>Senecas,</HI> our Brothers, were to forward the Me&s;&s;ages to all the <HI>United Nations.</HI></P>
<P>But in the Differences &s;ub&s;i&s;ting at pre&s;ent between you and our Nephews and Brothers, we have heard nothing from that Quarter, though we are &s;en&s;ible that Me&s;&s;engers arrived there upon this Affair. And as we, the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> are a Door to the Ea&s;tward of the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Country, e&s;tabli&s;hed at the &s;ame time with that to the We&s;tward, finding that they neglected their Offices, we took the Affair in Hand, and &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers to <HI>Ot&s;aningo,</HI> and there a Council was held, and the Deputies we &s;ent charged them to get &s;ober, as we looked upon their Actions as the Actions of drunken Men: This was the Sub&s;tance of the Speeches &s;ent to them.&mdash;They returned for an&s;wer, That they looked upon them&s;elves as Men, and would acknowledge no Superiority that any other Nation had over them.&mdash;We are Men, and are determined not to be ruled any longer by you as Women; and we are determined to cut off all the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> except tho&s;e that may make their E&s;cape from us in Ships; &s;o &s;ay no more to us on that Head, le&s;t we cut off your private Parts, and make Women of you, as you have done of us. In the mean time, though they did not any longer acknowledge the <HI>Six Nations</HI> as their Uncles, yet they would li&s;ten to what <HI>Anugh Kary Tany Tionen Holo|rowy</HI> &s;hould &s;ay to them.&mdash;Him only they acknowledged for their Uncle.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding this ra&s;h Speech, they afterwards, at the In&s;tance of Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> agreed to a Ce&s;|&s;ation of Arms, to come to an Interview with him and their Brother <HI>Onas.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Brother, our Advice is to you, that you &s;end proper Me&s;&s;engers immediately to the <HI>Senecas,</HI> to invite them, with our Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and Brothers the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> to a Meeting with you here; and when they come, be very careful in your Proceedings with them, and do not be ra&s;h, and it will be in your Power to &s;ettle all the Differences &s;ub&s;i&s;ting betwen you and them: And we a&s;&s;ure you, Brethren, by this Belt of Wampum, that we will continue our good Offices till this Affair is brought to a happy Conclu&s;ion.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> Six United Nations,</P>
<P>I DESIRE to be informed if you have any Complaints again&s;t this Province, with Re|gard to Purcha&s;es of Land, or for any other Cau&s;e what&s;oever: In Expectation that you would freely open your Hearts to me on the&s;e Heads, I give you this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>I then acquainted the <HI>Indians</HI> by the Interpreter, that I was going to &s;peak to them in Behalf of the Honourable Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> Baronet, His Maje&s;ty's &s;ole Agent and Su|perintendent of the Affairs of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and their Allies and Dependents, and de&s;ired them to con&s;ider my Words as if &s;poken by him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Sachems and Warriors of the</HI> Six United Nations, <HI>our Friends and Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> at the Treaty held at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> complained that the <HI>Indians</HI> had been de|frauded of &s;ome of their Lands, this Government agreed to meet him upon his own Appoint|ment this Spring; to which Meeting you were invited, that you might &s;ee and hear every

<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's Subjects that have &s;ettled this and the neighbouring Provinces by Law, are not allowed to buy any of your Lands, and accordingly they have never done it; and if tho&s;e who only have a Right from the Crown to purcha&s;e your Lands have done you any Inju&s;tice, or injured the <HI>Indians</HI> on this Account, the Governor of this Province, with a Number of the chief Men of this Government, are here, and appear hearty and willing to make Satisfaction; but if they, or the People of the&s;e Provinces, &s;hould refu&s;e doing you Ju&s;tice, when you make it appear that you are injured, I will then carefully repre&s;ent your Ca&s;e to the King of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> my Ma&s;ter, and your Father, in order to procure you ample and immediate Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As Deputies from mo&s;t of the Tribes of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> are now here, who may not be pre&s;ent when <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> comes down, and as I am ordered and required by the Honour|able Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> Baronet, His Maje&s;ty's chief Agent and Superintendent of the Affairs of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> their Allies and Dependents, to enquire into and hear the Com|plaints made by the <HI>Indians,</HI> and, if ju&s;tly grounded, to u&s;e my utmo&s;t Endeavours to get them redre&s;&s;ed, I do in&s;i&s;t upon it, that you open your Hearts to me without Re&s;erve, and inform me of every Thing you know concerning Frauds complained of by <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> or any other Injuries or Inju&s;tice done to you, or any of the Tribes of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> or other <HI>In|dians</HI> in Alliance with His Maje&s;ty King GEORGE, in this or the neighbouring Colonies, that I may be thereby enabled to repre&s;ent the true State of your Grievances to His Maje&s;ty.&mdash;Bre|thren, after this candid Conduct towards you, and my thus pre&s;&s;ing you to open your Minds to me, I do expect that you will hide nothing from me, but &s;peak from the Bottom of your Hearts: And I expect that you will recommend it to your Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and Bro|thers the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> to come down and give your Brother <HI>Onas</HI> a Meeting, to make their Complaints appear, and have them adju&s;ted, el&s;e I &s;hall take it for granted that they have no ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Complaint: To inforce what I have &s;aid, I give you this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> United Nations,</P>
<P>You remember that your Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and Brothers the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> in a Coun|cil with you at <HI>Ot&s;aningo,</HI> promi&s;ed to lay down their Hatchet, and in a &s;ub&s;equent Meeting with Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> at his Hou&s;e, in <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, ratified and confirmed it in the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn Manner in your Pre&s;ence; then promi&s;ing to deliver up all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners that were by any Means brought to their Country, or in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and I de&s;ire that on your Return to your Country, you will remind your Nephews and Brothers of their Promi&s;es to Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> and recommend it &s;trongly to them to bring down what <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri|&s;oners they have among&s;t them, and deliver them up, as that is the only Proof they can give us of their Sincerity and good Di&s;po&s;ition towards us.</P>

<P><HI>Sachems and Warriors of the</HI> United Nations,</P>
<P>In that Meeting with your Brother <HI>Warraigheyagey,</HI> your Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and Brothers the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> renewed and brightened the Chain of Friend&s;hip between them and us, and promi&s;ed to fix their Eyes on you their Uncles, and regulate their Conduct by yours; and at the &s;ame time declared, in a publick Manner, by dancing, and &s;inging the War Song, that they would turn the Edge of their Hatchet, in Conjunction with you their Uncles the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> the treacherous and faithle&s;s Invaders of the Property of Mankind. And I mu&s;t now de&s;ire that you will in&s;i&s;t upon their being ready, when called upon, to join His Maje&s;ty's Troops, in Conjunction with you our Friends and Allies, again&s;t our common Enemy.&mdash;That this Speech may have its full Force upon your Minds, I pre|&s;ent you with this Belt of Wampum.</P>

<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>The Speeches you have ju&s;t made are of great Con&s;equence both to you and us.&mdash;We &s;hall duly con&s;ider them, and, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ibly we can, we will return you an An&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>May 18, 1757.</HI> This Day four Per&s;ons that were killed on the Frontiers, in the Settlement of <HI>Swetara,</HI> by the Enemy <HI>Indians,</HI> were brought to this Town.&mdash;In the Afternoon the chief <HI>Sachems,</HI> with a Number of their Warriors, called a Meeting in the <HI>Indian</HI> Camp, and &s;poke to us as follows.</P>

<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We have called this Meeting with Tears in our Eyes, on Account of &s;eeing &s;o many of our Brethren killed by the evil Spirit; and we take this Opportunity, as we have a good deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s yet to do, to wipe the Tears from your Eyes, &s;o that To-morrow, when we meet in Council, we may &s;ee each other with the &s;ame Good-will we have hitherto done.</P>

No Doubt but the <HI>French</HI> King, who takes delight in Mi&s;|chief, has taken this Opportunity to &s;end his Children down to commit the&s;e Murders, with Expectation of breeding a difference between you our Brethren and us; but we de&s;ire you will hold fa&s;t by the Chain of Friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us, and di&s;appoint him in his De&s;igns.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>EACH of you made us a Speech Ye&s;terday on the &s;ame Subject; both which Speeches I now propo&s;e to an&s;wer at once, and then &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P>Brothers,</P>
<P>Some Years ago, in the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> one of the Head Men of the <HI>Delawares</HI> had been out a Hunting.&mdash;On his Return, he called to &s;ee a Gentleman, a great Friend of his, one of your People, who he found in his Field: When the Gentleman &s;aw him he came to meet him. It was rainy Weather, and the <HI>Delaware</HI> Chief had his Gun under his Arm.&mdash;They met at a Fence, and as they reached out their Hands to each other, the <HI>Delaware</HI>'s Gun went off by Accident, and &s;hot him dead. He was very much grieved at the Accident, and went to the Hou&s;e, and told the Gentleman's Wife what had happened, and &s;aid he was willing to die, and did not choo&s;e to live after his Friend. She immediately &s;ent for a Number of the Inha|bitants.&mdash;When they were gathered, &s;ome &s;aid it was an Accident, and could not be helped; but the greate&s;t Number were for hanging him, and he was taken by the Sheriff, and carried to <HI>Amboy,</HI> where he was tried, and hanged.&mdash;There was another Misfortune that happen|ed.&mdash;A Party of <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> who were going to War again&s;t their Enemies, in their Way through <HI>Carolina,</HI> called at a Hou&s;e, not &s;u&s;pecting any Harm, as they were among&s;t their Friends, a Number of the Inhabitants ro&s;e and took them Pri&s;oners, on Account of &s;ome Mi&s;chief that was done there about that Time, &s;u&s;pecting them to be the People that had done the Mi&s;chief, and carried them to <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> and put them in Pri&s;on, where the chief Man, called <HI>The Pride,</HI> died.&mdash;The Relations of the&s;e People were much exa&s;perated again&s;t you our Brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> on Account of the ill Treatment you gave their Friends, and have been continually &s;piriting up their Nations to take Revenge&mdash;Brothers, you de&s;ired us to open our Hearts, and inform you of every Thing we knew that might give
<PB N="16" REF="007920_0015_102E017DEBC57D78">Ri&s;e to the Quarrel between you and our Nephews and Brothers.&mdash;We mu&s;t now inform you, that in former Times our Forefathers conquered the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and put Petticoats on them.&mdash;A long Time after that they lived among you our Brothers, but upon &s;ome Diffe|rence between you and them, we thought proper to remove them, giving them Lands to plant and hunt on at <HI>Wyoming</HI> and <HI>Juniata,</HI> on <HI>Sa&s;quehannah.</HI>&mdash;But you, covetous of Land, made Plantations there, and &s;poiled their hunting Grounds; they then complained to us, and we looked over tho&s;e Lands, and found their Complaints to be true. At this Time they carried on a Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>French,</HI> by which Means the <HI>French</HI> became acquaint|ed with all the Cau&s;es of Complaint they had again&s;t you; and as your People were daily en|crea&s;ing their Settlements, by this Means you drove them back into the Arms of the <HI>French,</HI> and they took the Advantage of &s;piriting them up again&s;t you, by telling them; "Children, you &s;ee, and we have often told you, how the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> your Brethren, would &s;erve you; they plant all the Country, and drive you back; &s;o that in a little Time you will have no Land: It is not &s;o with us; though we build Trading-Hou&s;es on your Land, we do not plant it; we have our Provi&s;ions from over the great Water."&mdash;We have opened our Hearts, and told you what Complaints we have heard that they had again&s;t you; and our Advice to you is, that you &s;end for the <HI>Senecas</HI> and them; treat them kindly, and rather give them &s;ome Part of their Fields back again than differ with them.&mdash;It is in your Power to &s;ettle all the Differences with them if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Gave two Belts, one for Sir</HI> William John&s;on, <HI>and one for the Governor</HI></P>
<P>Little Abraham <HI>&s;poke again as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>As to what pa&s;&s;ed between you and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> la&s;t Fall, re&s;pecting the Purcha&s;e of Lands we know nothing of;&mdash;they are not here, and if we enquire, we can only hear what you &s;ay on that Head.&mdash;We &s;hould have been glad our Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and Brothers the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> had been here at this Time, that we might have heard the Complaints on both Sides; then we &s;hould have been able to judge who was in the Fault, and we are determined to &s;ee Ju&s;tice done to the Party aggrieved.&mdash;As they are not here, we can &s;ay nothing about it; but you your&s;elves, between whom the Bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted, mu&s;t be the be&s;t Judges.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>You acquaint us there are certain Per&s;ons empowered by the King to purcha&s;e Lands here from the <HI>Indians:</HI>&mdash;We are unacquainted with that, neither do we know how our Fa|ther, the King of <HI>England,</HI> has divided his Provinces.&mdash;You &s;ay, if you have done the <HI>Indians</HI> any Inju&s;tice, you are willing to make them Satisfaction. We are glad to hear it; and as you have Writings to refre&s;h your Memories about every Tran&s;action that has happened be|tween you and our Nephews and Brothers, the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> we recommend it heartily to you to do Ju&s;tice.&mdash;We are much concerned to &s;ee how you are u&s;ed by them and the <HI>French,</HI> every Day having your People killed, and you &s;itting with your Heads between your Legs, and receiving the Blow, without re&s;enting it, as if you could not, or would not, fight to defend your&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We de&s;ire that you may not think of great Expeditions far off.&mdash;U&s;e your be&s;t Endeavours to defend your Frontiers, and protect the Lives of your People.&mdash;It is better for you to give up &s;ome Points to them, than to contend, provided they &s;hould be in the Wrong, and &s;et|tle all Differences &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between you as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt,</HI></P>
<P>He added, Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> take Pattern by Sir <HI>William John&s;on;</HI> he always keeps large Par|ties patrolling acro&s;s the Frontiers where he lives, and you do not hear of any Murders being committed there.&mdash;That is the Way to defend your&s;elves.&mdash;The Enemy is afraid to enter the Settlements there; and if you pur&s;ue the &s;ame Mea&s;ures, they will be afraid to come into your Settlements.</P>
<P>Thomas King <HI>then &s;poke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We have con&s;idered what you &s;aid to us, about our reque&s;ting the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawa|ne&s;e</HI> to bring down and deliver up all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners they have, agreeable to their Pro|mi&s;es to Sir <HI>William John&s;on.</HI>&mdash;We will do every Thing in our Power that may induce them to do it; but perhaps it will not be in our Power to prevail on them to give them up.&mdash; Once more we de&s;ire that you would &s;end for the <HI>Senecas</HI> and them, and endeavour to &s;ettle all tho&s;e Differences.&mdash;It is in your Power to do it. When it is done, you will certainly &s;ee &s;ome of your own Fle&s;h and Blood again.</P>

<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It is true, we were pre&s;ent when the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> brightened the Chain of Friend&s;hip with Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> and promi&s;ed to turn the Edge of their Hatchet again&s;t the <HI>French.</HI>&mdash;But you mu&s;t know that la&s;t Fall, tho' they went out to War with us, they always turned back, and did not perform what they had promi&s;ed; &s;o that we cannot ac|count for what they will do now.&mdash;But for our Parts, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> we have been engaged in the War with you, and are always ready, when we &s;ee an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Flag, to join our Bro|thers, and to go with them, and &s;hare the &s;ame Fate.</P>

<P>Soon after the pre&s;ent Troubles fir&s;t broke out between us and the <HI>French,</HI> &s;ome of the <HI>Six Nation Indians</HI> reque&s;ted of this Government to build a &s;trong Hou&s;e at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> and a Store-hou&s;e, with <HI>Indian</HI> Goods, and to give an Invitation to <HI>Indians,</HI> as well of the <HI>United Na|tions</HI> as <HI>Delawares,</HI> to come and live there; I mu&s;t now inform you, that in Compliance with their Reque&s;t this Government has built a &s;trong Hou&s;e, where Goods will &s;oon be &s;ent, and &s;old as cheap as any where on this Continent.&mdash;To this Place I have appointed Mr. <HI>Tho|mas M'Kee</HI> to conduct as many of you as &s;hall chu&s;e to return that Way, and &s;hall leave it to you to &s;ettle as many Families as &s;hall incline to live there; promi&s;ing you, that Care &s;hall be taken by this Government, that as many as &s;tay &s;hall be furni&s;hed with &s;uch Nece&s;&s;aries as they may want till they can &s;upport them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>

<P>I &s;hall immediately report the whole that has pa&s;&s;ed at the&s;e Conferences to Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> who is glad of all Occa&s;ions to &s;hew his Attachment to our Friends the <HI>Indians,</HI> and promote His Maje&s;ty's Service.&mdash;It is that Gentleman's peculiar Province to treat and fini&s;h all Treaties with the <HI>Indians.</HI>&mdash;Let me add, my Brethren of the <HI>United Nations,</HI> that you &s;hall find no Deceit in me, and I &s;hall be happy if my Conduct de&s;erves your E&s;teem and Approbation.</P>

<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have ordered the Pre&s;ents provided by the good People of this Province to be carried to the <HI>Indian</HI> Camp early in the Morning; and inform you, that a Part of the&s;e Pre&s;ents is given by tho&s;e who are the De&s;cendents of the Inhabitants that fir&s;t came over to this Country with your old Friend <HI>William Penn,</HI> as a particular Te&s;timony of their Regard and Affection for the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Sachems and Warriors of the</HI> United Nations,</P>
<P>You &s;ee how the <HI>French,</HI> the Enemies of Mankind, &s;et on their Children to murder, in a barbarous Manner, your Brethren that are &s;ettled on the Frontiers of this and the neighbour|ing Provinces.&mdash;Brethren, I mu&s;t now de&s;ire you, in the Name of the Great King of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> your Father, and my Ma&s;ter, that on your Return to your own Country, you will be active, and not &s;uffer any of the <HI>French,</HI> or their Children, to pa&s;s over your Lands to murder your Brethren; and that you will let <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> and his People know, I expect he will do the &s;ame.&mdash;Tell them it is not, nor will not be, their Intere&s;t to carry on the War again&s;t their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>&mdash;Their Father, the <HI>French</HI> King, makes Fools of them, and will, in the End, make Slaves of them: But you, Brethren, are convinced, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have always treated you as their Brethren, and I expect a due Regard and Performance to this Reque&s;t on your Side.</P>

<P>Little Abraham <HI>made the following An&s;wer to the Governor.</HI></P>

<P><HI>He &s;poke again as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Warraighiyagey,</P>
<P>We have all given Attention to what you have &s;aid to us by <HI>Anaquarunda;</HI> and you may depend upon our being on the Active, and doing every Thing in our Power to prevent the <HI>French</HI> or their Chidren coming to murder our Brethren; and we will recommend it &s;trongly to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and his People, to do the &s;ame.&mdash;Brother, we mu&s;t de&s;ire you will a&s;&s;i&s;t our Brother <HI>Onas</HI> in &s;ettling the Differences between him and our Nephews and Brothers, the <HI>De|lawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> which will be the only Method to prevent the&s;e cruel Murders daily committed on our Brethren.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 21&s;t. The Pre&s;ents were delivered to the <HI>Indians</HI> in their own Camp; after which I condoled with them on account of &s;ome of their People who died of the Small-pox &s;ince they came here, and gave them a Piece of Stroud to cover the Graves of the De|cea&s;ed, agreeable to the antient Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;everal Chiefs returned their hearty thanks for our condoling with them, and cover|ing the Graves of their decea&s;ed Friends, agreeable to the antient Cu&s;tom u&s;ed by their Fore|fathers, and expre&s;&s;ed great Satisfaction with the Treatment they met with in this Govern|ment, and returned Thanks for the Pre&s;ents they had received.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 22.

<P><HI>To which they made me the following An&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have con&s;idered every Part of your Me&s;&s;age to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and we approve much of it, and think it will be acceptable to our Nephews and Brothers; and we likewi&s;e approve of

<P><HI>The Speech &s;ent by the Governor to</HI> Teedyu&s;cung.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyu&s;cung,</P>
<P>AT the Treaty held at <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> la&s;t Fall, you complained unto me that the <HI>Indians</HI> had been defrauded of their Lands.&mdash;This you told me was one of the Cau&s;es that had alienated the Minds of our Brethren, the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> from us your Brethren; &mdash;upon which I told you, if you could make it appear that you had received any Inju&s;tice or Injuries from this Province, I was ready to hear it, and promi&s;ed to make you Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You then informed me, that the People who claimed tho&s;e Lands, as they did not expect that Affair would come under Con&s;ideration at that Treaty, were not pre&s;ent, and had not impowered you to tran&s;act that Bu&s;ine&s;s for them, and therefore you could not fini&s;h it at that Time, but that you would come down again in the Spring, and would bring with you as many of tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> as could be got together, in order to a full Settlement of all Diffe|rences between us, that a firm and la&s;ting Peace might be e&s;tabli&s;hed for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>As you had thus promi&s;ed to be down in the Spring, we were plea&s;ed to find a con&s;ide|rable Number of your Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> were come among&s;t us, to be pre&s;ent and hear all your Complaints.&mdash;They &s;taid a con&s;iderable Time for that Purpo&s;e, in Expecta|tion of &s;eeing you here; but as &s;ome Accident may have prevented your coming, your Uncles grew very unea&s;y at being detained here &s;o long, and de&s;ired me to meet them at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> whither I went, and opened my Heart to them, giving them a full Account of all that pa&s;|&s;ed between us at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> promi&s;ing your Uncles, that I would take Care to &s;ee you redre&s;&s;ed, either on account of your Lands, or any other Injuries you may have received from your Brethren of this Province.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Your Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> at this Treaty, &s;hewed a great deal of Kindne&s;s for you, and would have been extremely plea&s;ed to have &s;een you here, being re&s;olved to &s;ee Ju&s;tice done to you; but as you were not come in, they advi&s;ed us to treat you very tenderly, and to advi&s;e you to bring with you &s;ome of your Uncles, the <HI>Senecas,</HI> that we might open our Hearts to one another freely, by which Means all Cau&s;es of Jealou&s;ies, or Mi&s;under&s;tandings between us, might be &s;ettled and taken away for ever, and that they would join their be&s;t Endeavours to bring about a firm and la&s;ting Peace between you and your Brethren.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I gave your Uncles my hearty Thanks for their good Advice; and told them, that as I highly approved it, as good and &s;ound Advice, I would act as they had &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired me to do, being &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to hear all your Complaints, and to do you Ju&s;tice, as I had formerly promi&s;ed you at <HI>Ea&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>As I have now informed you of the earne&s;t Reque&s;t of your Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and of my own Opinion, which is the &s;ame with theirs, I do by this Belt of Wampum invite you to come down as &s;oon as it will &s;uit your Convenience, and leave it to you to bring with you your Uncles, the <HI>Senecas,</HI> or &s;uch of them as will be mo&s;t agreeable to you, to open your Hearts to us your Brethren; and if it &s;hall appear that you have been defrauded of your Lands, or received any other Injuries from this Province, I do promi&s;e you &s;hall receive Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>By &s;ome late Letters received from your Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> in An&s;wer to my Repre&s;entation of the late Conferences, and your Complaints at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> he acquaints me he is willing to have the Injuries complained of fully heard and &s;ettled as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;If you rather chu&s;e Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> &s;hould determine the&s;e unhappy Differences, I mo&s;t warmly recommend it to you to apply to that Gentleman, as he has the Honour to be ap|pointed &s;ole Agent and Superintendent of <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs in the Northern Di&s;trict.</P>

<P>THE Ninth of <HI>April,</HI> 1743, I arrived at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> by Order of the Governor of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania,</HI> to acquaint the neighbouring <HI>Indians,</HI> and tho&s;e on <HI>Wyoming,</HI> that the Go|vernor of <HI>Virginia</HI> was well plea&s;ed with his Mediation, and was willing to come to an Agreement with the <HI>Six Nations</HI> about the Land his People were &s;ettled upon, if it was that they contended for, and to make up the Matter of the late unhappy Skirmi&s;h in an amicable Way.

<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>At this critical Time we received a kind Me&s;&s;age from you, the Re&s;ult of the good Friend|&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between you and us.

<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We thank you for the Concern you &s;hew for the Misfortune that be&s;el our Warriors in <HI>Virginia.</HI> We take it as a particular Mark of Friend&s;hip. We a&s;&s;ure you, that notwith|&s;tanding the unju&s;t Treatment our Warriors met with in <HI>Virginia,</HI> we did not allow our Heads to be giddy, nor to re&s;ent it as it de&s;erved, which might have occa&s;ioned a Violation of Treaties, and the De&s;truction of many.</P>
<P><HI>He laid down four Strings of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We thank you very kindly for the early Steps you made in calling your old and wi&s;e Men together to con&s;ult with them. It was a very prudent and good Advice they gave you to be|come Mediator betwixt us your Brethren, and the <HI>Virginians</HI> your Neighbours. We thank them for &s;uch good Advice: And we a&s;&s;ure you, we will accordingly come to an amicable Accommodation with the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> if he will come to rea&s;onable Terms. And if a War &s;hould break out betwixt us and him, you will be convinced of his being the Au|thor of it: For when in former Times we received a deadly Blow, we never returned it, if it was ever &s;o dangerous; we always judged it to be given by di&s;orderly People, and we u&s;ed always peaceable Means to make it up; but when we received the &s;econd Blow, we judged that War was intended again&s;t us, and then we ro&s;e and knocked down our Enemies with one Blow, and we are &s;till able to do the &s;ame, but we leave now our Ca&s;e to you. We have ordered our Warriors, with the &s;tronge&s;t Words, to &s;it down, and not revenge them|&s;elves: Therefore, Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> go on with Courage in your Mediation; we a&s;&s;ure you we will not violate or do any Thing contrary to your Mediation.

<P><HI>Then the Speech was directed to the Governor of</HI> Maryland.</P>
<P><HI>Brother, the Governor of</HI> Maryland,</P>
<P>You have invited us to come to your Town; and you offered to treat with us concerning the Me&s;&s;ages we &s;ent to you by our Brother the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and to e&s;tabli&s;h good Friend&s;hip with us: We are very glad you did &s;o; and we thank you for your kind Invitation.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have a great deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Things of Moment under our Deliberation, and it will take us the be&s;t of the Day

<P><HI>The Speaker laid down four Strings of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then the Speaker directed his Speech to the Governor of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania <HI>again, and &s;aid;</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutchman</HI> on <HI>Scohooniady (Juniata)</HI> claims a Right to the Land, merely becau&s;e he gave a Little Victuals to our Warriors, who &s;tand very often in Need of it. This String of Wampum &s;erves (the Speaker then took two Strings of Wampum in his Hands) to take the <HI>Dutchman</HI> by the Arm, and throw him over the big Mountains within your Borders. WE HAVE GIVEN THE RIVER SCOHOONIADY (JUNIATA) FOR A HUNTING-PLACE TO OUR COUSINS THE DELAWARE INDIANS, AND OUR BRETHREN THE SHAWANESE; and we our&s;elves hunt there &s;ometimes. We therefore de&s;ire you will immediately, by Force, remove all tho&s;e that live on the &s;aid River of <HI>Scohooniady.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Here be laid down two Strings of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother, the Governor of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania;</P>
<P>I live upon this River of <HI>Ohio</HI> harmle&s;s like a little Child: I can do nothing; I am but weak; and I do not &s;o much as intend Mi&s;chief. I have nothing to &s;ay, and do therefore &s;end the&s;e Strings of Wampum to <HI>Catchcawat&s;iky,</HI> the Chief Man, again; he will an&s;wer your Me&s;&s;age, as he is the older, and greater, Man.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Sach&s;idora</HI> took up the four Strings of Wampum, and &s;poke in Behalf of <HI>Catchcawat&s;iky,</HI> as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother, the Governor of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania,</P>
<P>The Place where I live, and the neighbouring Country, has been over&s;hadowed of late by a very dark Cloud. I looked with a pitiful Eye upon the poor Women and Children, and then looked upon the Ground all along for Sorrow, in a mi&s;erable Condition, becau&s;e of the poor Women and Children. In all that dark Time, a Me&s;&s;age from you found the Way to <HI>Shamakin;</HI> and when it was delivered to us, the dark Cloud was di&s;per&s;ed, and the Sun im|mediately began to &s;hine; and I could &s;ee at a great Di&s;tance, and &s;aw your Good-will and kind Love to the <HI>Indians</HI> and the white People: I thank you, therefore, Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> for your kind Me&s;&s;age; I am now able to comfort the poor Women and Children.</P>
<P><HI>Here the Speaker laid down four Strings of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then the Speaker took up two Strings of Wampum, and directed his Di&s;cour&s;e to the</HI> Delaware In|dians, <HI>the</HI> Shawane&s;e, <HI>and to</HI> Onas.</P>
<P><HI>Cou&s;ins the Delawares,</HI></P>
<P>We are informed that you can talk a little <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by which you have heard many Things among&s;t the white People; and you frequently bring Lies among&s;t the <HI>Indians;</HI> and you have very little Knowledge and Regard for Treaties of Friend&s;hip; you give your Tongue too much Liberty. This String of Wampum &s;erves to tie your Tongue, and to forewarn you from Lies.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the</HI> Shawane&s;e,</P>
<P>You believe too many Lies, and are too forward in Action. You &s;hall not pretend to re|venge our People that have been killed in <HI>Virginia:</HI> We are the Chief of all the <HI>Indians;</HI> let
<PB N="22" REF="007920_0021_102E018C1EDAAE80">your Ears and Eyes be open towards us; and order your Warriors to &s;tay at Home as we did ours.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Your Back Inhabitants are People given to Lies, and rai&s;ing of fal&s;e Stories; &s;top up their Mouths; you can do it with one Word; let no fal&s;e Stories be told; it is dangerours to the Chain of Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The Strings of Wampum were delivered to the <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>
<P>After the Speaker had fini&s;hed, an hand&s;ome <HI>Indian</HI> Dinner was given to all that were pre|&s;ent by <HI>Shickallemo</HI>'s People.</P>
<P>After Dinner I delivered my Me&s;&s;age to them, and pre&s;ented the Company with two Rolls of Tobacco, about three Pound each Roll, to &s;moak whil&s;t they were in Company together, to talk about the good News they had heard that Day, according to the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>In|dians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shickallemo</HI> told me, by Way of Di&s;cour&s;e, that they (the Council of <HI>Onondago</HI>) had &s;ent Strings of Wampum by him to all the <HI>Indians</HI> upon the River <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> to tell them to u&s;e their Endeavours to &s;top all their Warriors, and not permit them to go to fight with the People of <HI>Virginia;</HI> and to acquaint them of what was agreed upon in <HI>Onondago,</HI> which was accepted of in every Town.&mdash;I enquired what Bu&s;ine&s;s of Moment the <HI>Six Nations</HI> had under Deliberation that prevented their coming down to treat with the Governor of <HI>Maryland. Shickallemo</HI> a&s;ked whether I could not gue&s;s at it. I told him no. Then he &s;aid, How &s;hould they come down with a Hatchet &s;truck in their Head? The Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> mu&s;t wa&s;h off the Blood fir&s;t, and take the Hatchet out of their Head, and dre&s;s the Wound (according to Cu&s;tom, he that &s;truck fir&s;t mu&s;t do it) and the Council of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> will &s;peak to him, and be reconciled to him, and bury that Affair in the Ground, that it never may be &s;een nor heard of any more &s;o long as the World &s;tands.&mdash;But if the <HI>Virginians</HI> would not come to do that, he <HI>(Shickallemo)</HI> believed there would be a War; but I might a&s;&s;ure the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> the Warriors would not come then within the inhabited Part of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> but direct their Cour&s;e directly to <HI>Virginia.</HI> over the <HI>Big I&s;land,</HI> in the North-We&s;t Branch of <HI>Sa&s;quehannah.</HI></P>
