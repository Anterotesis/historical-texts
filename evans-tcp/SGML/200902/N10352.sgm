<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE treati&s;e of which the following is an extract, was written in the German language, about two hundred and fifty years ago, and &s;ince tran&s;lated into the French.&mdash; Tho' the reader is not to expect elegancy of language, in writings of that age; yet, it is thought, the plainne&s;s and hone&s;t &s;im|plicity of the author, who had &s;olely the amendment of the hearts of his readers in view; and the divine unction which attends his writings, will make it acceptable and profitable to the awakened, unprejudiced inquirers, of every religious denomination.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t ages of chri&s;tianity, humility and contrition of heart towards God, and love towards men, were taught to be the mo&s;t ac|ceptable &s;acrifice; and a compliance with tho&s;e practical precepts &s;o &s;trongly enjoined, by our Saviour, was looked upon as the foundation of true di&s;ciple&s;hip and certain te&s;t of our af|fection to him, <HI>John</HI> xiv. 15. <HI>If ye love me</HI> (&s;aith this ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer), <HI>keep my commandments.</HI> John xv. 14. <HI>Ye are my friends, if ye do what|&s;oever I command you.</HI> Again, <HI>John</HI> xv. 8. <HI>Here|in is my heavenly Father glorified, that ye bring forth much good fruit.</HI> And that none might

mi&s;take the true way to everla&s;ting life, he concludes the precepts he delivered con|cerning it, with the&s;e remarkable words, <HI>Mat.</HI> vii. 24.&mdash;<HI>Who&s;oever heareth the&s;e &s;ayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him unto a wi&s;e man, who built his hou&s;e upon a rock,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This continued to be the &s;tate of the church, till in after-ages the life of religion having much declined, the plain belief and practice of piety, founded &s;olely on the power of the go&s;pel, fell to decay; in the place of which pomp and &s;hew, &s;trange modes of wor|&s;hip and confu&s;ed and dark opinions, till then unknown in the church, were introduced; the teachers and leaders a&s;&s;umed an autho|rity and re&s;pect from their offices, which before was paid only to their virtues. Hence divi&s;ions and contentions en&s;ued, by which that pure charity, which before had united and adorned the chri&s;tian church, was gra|dually lo&s;t to the generality of profe&s;&s;ors. Neverthele&s;s true religion &s;till remains to this day, to be the power of God to &s;alva|tion, changing and purifying the heart, and bringing it into true contrition and a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive re&s;ignation to the will of God. This has, ever, been found to be the effect of its operation on all tho&s;e, who by devoting them&s;elves to God, are become the true fol|lowers and di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the many in&s;tances of this kind,
<PB N="v" REF="013145_0004_0F8EC33BE8538C20">
which might be mentioned, a particular one appeared, &s;ome years ago, in the&s;e parts, thro' the effectual workings of grace, on a number of our neighbouring Indians. The&s;e people were very earne&s;t for the promotion of piety among them&s;elves, which they ap+prehended to be the effect of an inward work, whereby the heart became changed from bad to good <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><BIBL>ISA. xlix. 6.</BIBL>

<P>Who was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</P></Q></NOTE>. When they were &s;olicited to join the other Indians in the war again&s;t the Engli&s;h, they ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, what|ever might be the con&s;equence to them|&s;elves, even if the fighting Indians &s;hould make <HI>&s;laves,</HI> or as they expre&s;&s;ed it, <HI>negroes of them,</HI> rendering this rea&s;on for it, <HI>That when God made men, he did not intend they &s;hould hurt or kill one another.</HI> Upon being farther conver&s;ed with, in re&s;pect to their religious pro&s;pect, he who had been the principal in&s;trument in rai&s;ing them to a &s;en&s;e of good, gave in &s;ub&s;tance, the follow|ing accounts. That being by a particular providence brought under difficulty and &s;orrow, he was led into a deep con&s;ideration of the &s;tate of things in the world, when &s;eeing the folly and wickedne&s;s which pre|vailed
<PB N="vi" REF="013145_0005_0F8EC33CA2E15240">
among&s;t men, his &s;orrows encrea&s;ed. Neverthele&s;s, being impre&s;&s;ed with a belief that there was a great power, who had cre|ated all things, his mind was turned from beholding this lower world, to look towards him who had created it, and &s;trong de&s;ires were begot in his heart for a further know|ledge of his Creator. He was then made &s;en&s;ible, that evil not only prevailed in the world, but that he him&s;elf partook much of its baneful influence, and he at la&s;t found that his own heart was bad and hard. Upon this great dejection and trouble &s;eized his mind, with an inquiry, What would become of his &s;oul? In this &s;ituation he cried unto that powerful Being who he was &s;en&s;ible had made the heart of man; and after a long time of &s;orrow and per&s;everance in &s;eeking for help, God was plea&s;ed to reveal him&s;elf to his mind, and to put his goodne&s;s in his heart:&mdash;He found he was, as he expre&s;&s;ed it, rai&s;ed above him&s;elf and above the world, and felt that his heart had undergone &s;ome great change; the hardne&s;s and badne&s;s he had &s;o long groaned under, was taken away,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><BIBL>EZEKIEL xxxvi. 26.</BIBL>
<P>A new heart al&s;o will I give you, and a new &s;pirit will I put within you: and I will take away the &s;tony heart out of your fle&s;h, and I will give you an heart of fle&s;h.</P></Q></NOTE> it was now become &s;oft and good;
<PB N="vii" REF="013145_0005_0F8EC33CA2E15240">
he found &s;o much love to prevail in it, to all men, that he thought he could bear with their revilings and abu&s;es without re&s;ent|ment, appearing &s;en&s;ible that as the hearts of all men were bad and hard, till God made them good; the ill u&s;age he received from them, proceeded from the &s;ame evil &s;eed under which he him&s;elf had &s;o long groaned. This &s;en&s;e of the corruption of the human heart, accompanied with a con&s;tant applica|tion to his Maker, to take away the bad|ne&s;s and hardne&s;s of the heart, and make it &s;oft and good, was what he called religion; and what, upon feeling the power of God to his comfort in his heart, he was concern|ed to exhort his brethren to &s;eek the expe|rience of, in them&s;elves. And farther &s;aid, that under this di&s;pen&s;ation he was made &s;en&s;ible that the &s;pirit of religion, was a &s;pirit of love, which led tho&s;e who obeyed it, into love to all men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That this Indian had a true pro&s;pect of the happy effect of the power of the go&s;pel-&s;tate, upon tho&s;e who &s;ubmit to its requirings, appears from many parts of &s;cripture, particu|larly from the prophe&s;y of the evangelick prophet, <HI>I&s;a. chap. xxxv. 1&mdash;9.</HI> <Q>The wilderne&s;s and the &s;olitary places &s;hall be glad for them, and the de&s;erts &s;hall rejoice, and blo&s;&s;om as the ro&s;e:</Q>&mdash;It &s;hall blo&s;&s;om abundantly and rejoice even with joy and &s;inging.&mdash;They &s;hall &s;ee the glory of the Lord and the excellency of our God.&mdash;An high way &s;hall be there, and it &s;hall be called the way of holine&s;s. The way-fare|ing men, though fools, &s;hall not err therein. No lion &s;hall be there, nor any ravenous bea&s;ts &s;hall go up thereon, it &s;hall not be found there; but the redeemed &s;hall walk there. <HI>Chap. lx. 17.</HI> I will make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteou&s;ne&s;s; violence &s;hall no more be heard in the land, nor de&s;truction within thy borders; but thou &s;hall call thy wall &s;alvation, and thy gates prai&s;e.</NOTE>; but that men not keeping
<PB N="viii" REF="013145_0006_0F8EC33DC02D5578">
to this &s;pirit of love, an oppo&s;ite &s;pirit got entrance, in their hearts; that it was from hence, that aro&s;e all tho&s;e di&s;orders which &s;o much prevail among&s;t men. That he was al&s;o &s;en&s;ible there was &s;till an evil &s;pirit la|bouring to get the ma&s;tery in his heart, in oppo&s;ition to the go&s;pel &s;pirit; but that tho&s;e who had been vi&s;ited by a power from God, and were obedient to the degree of light and love, he was plea&s;ed to favour them with, would be more and more &s;trengthened and e&s;tabli&s;hed therein. He had al&s;o a pro&s;pect of the nece&s;&s;ity of that bapti&s;m of &s;pirit and fire which the &s;criptures and the experience of the faithful, in all ages, have te&s;tified every true di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t mu&s;t undergo; whereby, thro' mortification, and death to &s;elf, the root of &s;in is de&s;troyed. This he de&s;cribed by the pro&s;pect he had of &s;omething, like as an out|ward fire would be to the natural body; which he mu&s;t pa&s;s thro' in order to attain to that purity of heart he de&s;ired to attain. He farther ob&s;erved, that whil&s;t he was anxiou&s;ly beholding this fire, he &s;aw a very &s;mall path clo&s;e to the fire, by walking in
<PB N="ix" REF="013145_0006_0F8EC33DC02D5578">
which, he might go round the fire, and the painful tryal be avoided.&mdash;This he under&s;tood to repre&s;ent the way by which tho&s;e who were e&s;teemed wi&s;e had &s;ound means to avoid that probation they ought to have pa&s;&s;ed thro' and yet retained a name among&s;t men, as though they had been puri|fied by it. Thus this Indian, untaught by books and unlearned in what is called divinity, ex|plained the my&s;tery of godline&s;s in a plain and &s;en&s;ible manner, and in that child-like &s;implicity, which our Saviour recommends as the badge of acceptance with God. This is the wi&s;dom which on account of its plain|ne&s;s and &s;implicity, has in all ages been hid from the wi&s;e and prudent, and revealed only to babes, who in hone&s;t &s;incerity of heart look &s;olely to God in their di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of the like kind, has lately appeared in the ca&s;e of the conver&s;ion of a con&s;iderable number of the Indian natives of Greenland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>David Grantz's</HI> Hi&s;tory of Greenland, printed 176.</NOTE>. Tho&s;e people were, during a long time, &s;trongly &s;olicited to become converts to chri&s;tianity but with little or no &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As long as the poor natives had no con|ception nor feeling of the corruption of their hearts; nor any longing for a better condition, but only apprehended chri&s;tiani|ty
<PB N="x" REF="013145_0007_0F8EC341710A5240">
to con&s;i&s;t in the repetition of creeds and confe&s;&s;ions of truths contained in the &s;crip|tures, little or no impre&s;&s;ion was made upon them. But as &s;oon, as they became &s;en&s;ible of the corruption and hardne&s;s of their hearts, and believed the publication of the go&s;pel, to contain in it it&s;elf, a power thro' which they might be delivered from that burden of &s;in and corruption which lay upon them, they embraced it with joy, and crying to God for power, many became the objects of re|deeming grace; experiencing the &s;tony heart to be taken away, and a heart of fle&s;h to be given them. And indeed the grace which prevailed among&s;t the&s;e &s;imple, ignorant people, was cau&s;e of amazement, and &s;uch as mu&s;t, by its &s;urprizing effect, oblige peo|ple to ri&s;e to the fir&s;t cau&s;e, and acknow|ledge it could not proceed but from God alone. The author of the hi&s;tory, who was on the &s;pot, ob&s;erves, that he could not help thinking that tho&s;e &s;ceptics, who incline to doubt of every thing, which their rea&s;on cannot comprehend, and who deny the effi|cacy of the grace, or at lea&s;t judge it in&s;uf|ficient, towards effecting a total change of the minds and morals of men, might be clearly convinced of their error, in behold|ing the&s;e Indians, who had been born and brought up in an uncontrouled licence, like wild bea&s;ts, de&s;titute of education, totally
<PB N="xi" REF="013145_0007_0F8EC341710A5240" MS="y">
ignorant of religious impre&s;&s;ions; and &s;o carele&s;s and remi&s;s, that they thought of nothing but what plea&s;ed and gratified their outward &s;en&s;es; the&s;e people thro' the grace and illumination of the holy &s;pirit, to be|come &s;o di&s;creet, and carefully con&s;iderate, as voluntarily to &s;ubmit their necks to the obedience of faith, and realize the great truths of the go&s;pel to their &s;ouls, in &s;o ex|perimental and happy a manner, as to be able to deliver the mo&s;t glorious te&s;timonies thereof, with &s;pirit and power, declaring to others, the grace which they had expe|rienced in their own hearts; which together with their good deportment, among&s;t the unbelievers, adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour.</P>
<P>From the&s;e and many more in&s;tances which might be given, it evidently appears, that the go&s;pel is the power of God to &s;al|vation in all tho&s;e who believe, and in hone&s;t &s;implicity of heart re&s;ign them&s;elves up to God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><BIBL>JOHN i. 12.</BIBL>
<P>To as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the &s;ons of God.</P></Q></NOTE>. The chri&s;tian religion is indeed the &s;imple&s;t thing in the whole world, and the mo&s;t ea&s;y to be under&s;tood if <HI>&s;elf</HI> is but truly renounced.</P>

<HEAD>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE narrow path which leads to chri&s;tian perfection, doth not con&s;i&s;t in the attainment of much knowledge, neither in &s;ubtility of argument, nor yet in the practice of many outward works: but it con&s;i&s;ts in this, that through grace we crucify our fle&s;h, with all its &s;ins and di&s;orderly affections, re&s;ign our&s;elves with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God in all things, and patiently bear with the &s;lights and abu&s;es which may befal us from our fel|low men. That we daily take up our cro&s;s, and follow our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in his life and &s;ufferings, and in the love of our enemies: It al&s;o requires that we renounce all inordinate love of parents, children, or friends; and that the love
<PB N="2" REF="013145_0009_0F8EC34266382248">
and de&s;ire of riches and other earthly de|lights be mortified in us: Thus we may attain to purity of heart, and be enabled to love the Lord our God, with all our hearts, with all our &s;ouls and &s;trength, and our neighbour as our&s;elves, <HI>Mat.</HI> xxii. 37, 38. But this narrow and infallible path is become &s;o de&s;ert, and &s;o much ne|glected, and the love of God waxed &s;o cold, that there are very few who are found walking therein. People are gene|rally looking towards &s;en&s;ible objects, their principal de&s;ire being that their na|tural appetites, their covetou&s;ne&s;s, and their lu&s;ts may be &s;atisfied: Too many being content with knowing, but not complying with, their Ma&s;ter's Will.</P>
<P>The reader will find in this ab&s;tract, a &s;ummary of the chri&s;tian religion, and of the means whereby we may attain to that purity of heart and intimate union with God, to which we all are called, and for which we were created.</P>
<P>If this little book &s;hould, in the begin|ning appear too clo&s;e and &s;evere; never|thele&s;s let the reader take courage and beg for divine help, and if he per&s;everes in doing that which God will manife&s;t in his heart to be his duty; he will infallibly meet with divine aid.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> Wherein is &s;hewn, that if we are de&s;irous to live a truly chri&s;tian life, we mu&s;t die unto &s;in, and withdraw our affections from the creatures.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY per&s;on who &s;incerely de&s;ires to be converted to God, mu&s;t, thro' di|vine help, begin by for&s;aking all gro&s;s &s;ins, and dying to every vicious inclination, &s;uch as pride, impurity, anger, covetou&s;ne&s;s, hatred, &s;elf-love, &amp;c. and to all other &s;ins, which are committed in thought, word or action. We mu&s;t turn away from all &s;en&s;u|al plea&s;ures, renounce our attachment and dependance on the creatures, and from eve|ry thing that tends to encrea&s;e our natural corruption, and attachment to the world and the things of it, and every thing where|in the good plea&s;ure and &s;ervice of God is not our principal aim. We ought al&s;o, to be careful not to &s;uffer our affections to fix on particular per&s;ons, as we are too ea&s;ily led a&s;ide, by conforming to other people's natural di&s;po&s;itions; but let our regard be to all men, even as the &s;un equally enlight|ens the evil and the good, <HI>Mat.</HI> v. 45. All tho&s;e good things which God in his provi|dence
<PB N="4" REF="013145_0010_0F8EC34351830458">
favours us with, &s;hould be u&s;ed with di&s;cretion for nece&s;&s;ities, but by no means, to indulge our fle&s;hly appetites and de&s;ires, either in eating, drinking, &s;leeping, or other corporeal wants.</P>
<P>And when we are thus di&s;po&s;ed, we may be a&s;&s;ured God will freely afford every ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;upply, in order to enable us to ful|fil the duties he requires of us.</P>
<P>If we &s;incerely de&s;ire to love God, we mu&s;t, with fervent and humble &s;ighs, beg for di|vine help, carefully watch over our thoughts, words and actions, in whatever we &s;ee, do or omit, upon all that pa&s;&s;es both within and without us, &s;hunning, with the greate&s;t care, all occa&s;ions of &s;in, &s;uch as needle&s;s company, idle conver&s;ation, &amp;c. &amp;c. &s;o as continually to keep our hearts in the fear of God, which is as a fountain of &s;piritual &s;trength, with the eye of the mind bent to|wards him in reverence and love. For he who neglects the&s;e divine and powerful &s;up|ports, will be left as a city open on all &s;ides, and become a prey to worldly mindedne&s;s and &s;en&s;uality, and will finally be brought to ruin. For this rea&s;on we mu&s;t exert our utmo&s;t &s;trength again&s;t tho&s;e things which we are &s;en&s;ible have the greate&s;t hold of our affections, that our hearts being pre&s;erved in liberty, &s;implicity and purity, free from agi|tation
<PB N="5" REF="013145_0010_0F8EC34351830458">
and unea&s;ine&s;s, may not become a prey to any of tho&s;e evil de&s;ires, &s;o apt to di&s;&s;ipate the &s;pirit and engro&s;s the affections. Thus may we, thro' timely care, overcome all temptations; for he that is not careful to avoid &s;mall evils, will gradually fall into greater, in which the farther he &s;inks, the more difficult will his conver&s;ion to God be.</P>
<P>Let us be particularly careful to &s;hun all occa&s;ion of &s;uperfluous di&s;cour&s;e, and watch over our words, that we utter nothing but what may tend to the glory of God, or the good of our neighbour. Our ble&s;&s;ed Savi|our him&s;elf has declared, <HI>"That in the day of Judgment we mu&s;t give an account for every idle word."</HI> Mat. xii. 36. wherefore when we &s;peak, let it be done with an heart full of charity; in meekne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, and with deep humility.</P>
<P>Endeavour to avoid all occa&s;ions of &s;trife, rather &s;uffer lo&s;s than contend. Maintain thy peace with God, and be careful not to give occa&s;ion of &s;tumbling to any one. Have al&s;o a &s;pecial care over thy eyes, for it is by them thou art drawn into temptation, and expo&s;ed to many hurtful &s;nares.</P>
<P>In all tryals and contradictions look up to God, earne&s;tly begging for &s;trength, courage and patience; &s;o thou may&s;t, by per&s;evering in the exerci&s;e of virtue, be enabled to bring thy body in &s;ubjection, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ix. 27.

<P>The truly humble &s;oul who loves God, is always ready to give him the glory which is his due; and, when under a &s;ight of his own nothingne&s;s, will freely acknowledge that God's goodne&s;s is purely the effect of his love to his creatures, as they cannot add to his happine&s;s. Such a &s;oul, from a feel|ing &s;en&s;e of his mi&s;ery, will freely acknow|ledge, that from its own nature, it is as no|thing, yea le&s;s than nothing, being become as a de&s;iled ve&s;&s;el, which corrupts every
<PB N="14" REF="013145_0015_0F8EC3466D8AEB98">
thing which is poured into it; that he is a child of wrath, and under the cur&s;e, ready every day to fall back into his fearful no|thingne&s;s. Nay, he cannot but acknowledge him&s;elf &s;o filled with evil, and &s;o unable to help him&s;elf, that if God did not continu|ally prevent him, by his grace, he would be liable, each moment, to fall into the mo&s;t enormous &s;ins, and precipitate him&s;elf with the devil into eternal fire. In this humble &s;tate the &s;oul &s;en&s;ibly perceives how many &s;ins it has committed, in thought, word and action; how unfaithful and ungrateful he has been towards &s;o good and &s;o faith|ful a God, having omitted to &s;eek, with &s;incerity, his glory to whom alone it is due, and thus mi&s;erably lo&s;t his time; that ne|verthele&s;s God has been &s;o good as to for|give his &s;ins, even &s;o fully as never to re|member them any more, <HI>Mich.</HI> vii. 3. and to cau&s;e him to pa&s;s from a life of &s;in to a di|vine life; that thus from an enemy he is become his friend, which is a more excel|lent work than to have created a world.

In this &s;ituation a man will ea&s;ily bear to be de&s;pi&s;ed and reputed what he indeed e&s;teems him&s;elf to be.

he accepts of his &s;ickne&s;s and trouble as a me&s;&s;enger &s;ent from God for his good, thanks him for it, making this very afflic|tion an occa&s;ion of awakening his zeal for his &s;ervice.

There are people who may, in &s;ome degree, be &s;aid to be naturally di&s;po&s;ed to humility and other virtues, but God does not e&s;teem the&s;e people more holy on that account.

Wherefore, if we de&s;ire peace, the fir&s;t &s;tep we ought to take is to cea&s;e from all di&s;orderly love of our&s;elves; till then we will not find true freedom, nor be ma&s;ters of our&s;elves. The world and our other ene|mies attack us, only thro' our&s;elves; where|fore if we have gained a victory over our|&s;elves, we &s;hall have &s;ubdued all our other enemies. Nothing more worthy of hatred than &s;elf-love; this is the cau&s;e of all our griefs, and this is what hinders us from enjoying God, with all the trea&s;ures of his grace.</P>
<P>The le&s;s we have of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, the more agreeable we are to God, and the more di&s;|po&s;ed to receive his grace. As a man who lives in &s;elf-love cannot deny him&s;elf, and had rather lead others, than be led by them; in the &s;ame manner, a man who has for|&s;aken all things, is more inclined to &s;uffer and follow others, than to command them; for &s;uch an one &s;eeks to die to all pride, and

God readily compleats his work in him and leads him to perfection.</P>
<P>If a man &s;hould for&s;ake a kingdom, and all the world, if he cannot renounce him&s;elf, he has hardly done any thing.</P>
<P>Wilt thou know if thou art in the true nothingne&s;s, if thou art not yet under the dominion of a di&s;orderly love, ob&s;erve if thou art more moved at tho&s;e revilings, inju&s;tice or other accidents, which happen to thy&s;elf, than tho&s;e which happen to others. He who is afflicted at the lo&s;s of temporal goods, &s;hews thereby that he is unworthy of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them, as claiming them in his own right: Whereas God alone is the true owner and ma&s;ter of all. So al&s;o he who re&s;ents affronts, &s;hews that he indeed de|&s;erves to be de&s;pi&s;ed, becau&s;e he arrogates to him&s;elf that vengeance which belongs alone to God, and plainly di&s;covers that &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s and the love of the creatures are yet deeply rooted in his heart.</P>
<P>Our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>Mat.</HI> xvi. 24. <HI>If any man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf,</HI> (that is, his own inclination and will) and <HI>let him take up his cro&s;s and follow me.</HI> This is the infallible way to &s;alvation: therefore give diligent heed to thy&s;elf, in this matter; the &s;ooner and more thou art in the practice of this e&s;&s;ential duty, the ea&s;ier it will become to thee. Here it is thou mu&s;t begin, if thou

In that degree thou renounceth thy&s;elf, and the creatures; &s;o far God will vi&s;it and dwell in thee, by his grace, and thou wilt be enabled to become comformable to him. The more thou dieth to thy&s;elf, the more thou wilt feel the good &s;pirit predominant within thee; for in the degree that thou art unclothed from &s;in in the &s;elf-&s;ame degree wilt thou be rai&s;ed up to the love of God, and make advances in the way of holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Wherefore give all, <HI>for all,</HI> &s;ell all that thou ha&s;t, (i. e. thy&s;elf) to obtain all, and thou wilt find <HI>that all,</HI> in every thing, and withal a con&s;tant peace in thy heart, for nothing can alter and affect that peace which has its foundation in God. That happine&s;s and peace which we are pur&s;uing with &s;o much pain and difficulty, whil&s;t &s;elf is only in view, will be abundantly be|&s;towed on us, if we renounce our&s;elves, and fix our love &s;olely upon God. We mu&s;t not &s;o much look, at what we do, as at what we are; if the bottom of our heart was good, all our deeds would be upright and good; for a heart, who&s;e centre is &s;anctified and di&s;po&s;ed to glorify God is always favoured by him.</P>
<P>If we gave up our&s;elves and were willing to hazard all, as well that which is within, as that which is from without, we need fear

no danger, and &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s true content of &s;pirit. There are but few who entirely give them&s;elves up to the will of God, for no one can &s;o fully renounce him&s;elf, but what he may &s;till find &s;omething to renounce, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii. 10.</P>
<P>The Lord's prayer expre&s;&s;ed, even but once, in true &s;elf-denial, for the glory of God, is of more worth than thou&s;ands of prayers proceeding from our own will, and under the dominion of &s;elf.</P>
<P>An upright man, who endeavours to re|nounce him&s;elf, in whatever he does, is fixed in God; and God &s;o far protects him, that to attack him is in effect to attack God. All that this man does, and all that happens to him, nece&s;&s;arily comes from God; hence he enjoys the greate&s;t delight. Nothing can hurt &s;uch a man; &s;corn, inju&s;tice, the devil, death or hell it&s;elf, can do him no harm. Hence it appears that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God both inward and outward, is the &s;horte&s;t way to attain to the highe&s;t pitch of truth and perfection.</P>
<P>When a man truly becomes &s;o far con|formable to the will of God, as entirely to renounce him&s;elf, cea&s;ing from &s;eeking his own honour and advantage; de&s;iring no|thing but barely that the honour and good plea&s;ure of God may, in all things, be e&s;tab|li&s;hed; &s;uch an one will be freed from the

<P>PURITY and peace of heart, in the love of God, is much &s;trengthened, and en|crea&s;ed by a con&s;tant and &s;incere charity to|wards all men; and a tender compa&s;&s;ion for them, in their afflictions. This we are taught by our Saviour him&s;elf, when he &s;ays, <HI>John</HI> xiii. 35. <HI>By this &s;hall all men know that you are my di&s;ciples, if you have love one to another, Mat.</HI> v. 7. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the merciful, for they &s;hall obtain mercy.

If you have none at all, neither have you rea&s;on to ex|pect to obtain any your&s;elves. Wherefore
<PB N="27" REF="013145_0021_0F8EC34C90B32198">
let us demean our&s;elves towards all men, in that manner in which we de&s;ire they &s;hould act towards us; agreeable to our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's injunction, <HI>Mat.</HI> vii. 12. Our hearts ought always to be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uccour every man, whom we perceive to be under &s;ufferings, either of body or mind. We ought to pray, earne&s;tly, to God, that he would be&s;tow on us the gifts of com|pa&s;&s;ion and brotherly love. If it is in our power to a&s;&s;i&s;t our fellow-creature, either in word or deed, we ought to do it to the ut|mo&s;t of our power, with a free and willing heart; if much is not in our power, how|ever, let us do what we can, with a lively and &s;incere compa&s;&s;ion: at lea&s;t give him &s;ome comfort, and we &s;hall find God will al&s;o extend his mercy to us.</P>
<P>It is our duty to re&s;pect the image of God, and to regard his divine maje&s;ty in all men, and without delay, to u&s;e our be&s;t en|deavours that every degree of bitterne&s;s or &s;light may be removed out of our hearts, which may have in&s;en&s;ibly &s;lipped into them, again&s;t any per&s;on, whether high or low, rich or poor, for God is no re|&s;pector of per&s;ons.

mea&s;ure, rather magnifying than extenu|ing our own failing: On the other hard we &s;hould look with tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion on the failings of our neighbours; en|deavouring to behold them with an eye of indulgence; and let us be particularly careful never to &s;peak evil of any in their ab|&s;ence, <HI>James</HI> iv. 11.

Thus endeavouring to make the be&s;t of things.</P>
<P>Some people are &s;o much inclined to judge, that they are always ready to cen&s;ure and correct others; the&s;e in&s;tead of repent|ing, are often lo&s;t and do great hurt to tho&s;e that hear them, by rai&s;ing in their minds a &s;light and &s;corn of their neighbours; this generally proceeds from pride and an un|warrantable e&s;teem of them&s;elves. Poor blind man. Why do&s;t thou not, rather, judge and condemn thy&s;elf? How can&s;t thou be acquainted with what is hid in the heart of thy neighbour; or what knowe&s;t thou of the means by which it plea&s;es the

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> On the contemplation of the life and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE ought to con&s;ider and meditate, with an heart filled with love, on the doctrine and &s;ufferings of our crucified Saviour, in order to imitate and become conformable to him, <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 2. Wherefore earne&s;tly call upon God that it may plea&s;e him to imprint on thy body,and in thy &s;oul, the image of his death, that his holy will may be fulfilled in thee. Such meditation leads to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of divine wi&s;dom and &s;upreme happine&s;s; for hereby a man will be humbled in pro&s;perity, and meet with encouragement in adver&s;ity; and maintain an equality of &s;oul, both in joy and in &s;uffer|ing. Great are the advantages of &s;uch a meditation; it is as a book wherein all things are found: Happy is the man who has Chri&s;t and his &s;ufferings always pre&s;ent with him, he will obtain true wi&s;dom and unexpre&s;&s;ible grace. If other religious ex|erci&s;es are too difficult for thee, let it be thy

principle work to meditate on the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, and to pre&s;erve a lively remem|brance of them in thy mind, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 2.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tom thy&s;elf to compare all thou doe&s;t and &s;uffere&s;t with the life and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, and nothing will appear too dif|ficult to thee; for God will help thee to &s;upport thy &s;ufferings, and will, in the end, make thee a partaker of his mercies, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Saviour.</P>
<P>God's un&s;potted purity requires that all thy &s;ins &s;hould be thoroughly purged; he, therefore, who has lived a great part of his life, as it were, without God in the world, and who &s;till lives too much to the fle&s;h, with its affections and lu&s;ts, can &s;carce &s;uffi|ciently re&s;ign him&s;elf up to him in humi|lity, and lowline&s;s of &s;pirit, begging him for his mercies &s;ake, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to purge him from that evil &s;pirit of rebellion, which has taken &s;o deep a root in his heart, and &s;eparated him from the love of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>And if thou art one of tho&s;e who have neglected or forgot this mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential duty, until thou thinks thy&s;elf on a death bed, and &s;hould then be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of thy &s;ins; take this &s;alutary coun&s;el, plunge thy&s;elf, as it were, in the ocean of thy Saviour's &s;ufferings; entreat him to wa&s;h away thy &s;ins, thro' his infinite mercy,
<PB N="32" REF="013145_0024_0F8EC34EAE4663C8">
and hereupon abandon thy&s;elf to him, with a true faith and confidence in his holy will, and thou wilt experience, that the promi&s;es of Chri&s;t will be fulfilled, <HI>viz.</HI> that he will not reject the truly repenting &s;inner. And &s;houlde&s;t thou &s;urvive, be careful to watch during the remaining part of thy life, again&s;t &s;in, and &s;erve God with all thy power, that on thy death bed, thou maye&s;t have a &s;en&s;e of peace and reconciliation with God, which will be of more value to thee than if thou &s;houlde&s;t gain the whole world.</P>
<P>The &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t ought not to be meditated on in a &s;uperficial manner, but with a lively inward &s;en&s;ibility and an ar|dent and con&s;tant love. If thou can'&s;t not do it with tears and dolorous &s;ight, do it with prai&s;e and thankfulne&s;s, under a con|&s;ideration of the infinite goodne&s;s of thy Saviour. And tho' thou can'&s;t not attain to &s;uch &s;en&s;ible feelings as thou de&s;ire&s;t, and thy heart &s;hould remain dry and hard: Yet cea&s;e not from &s;uch meditation; keep thy mind in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and this offerings will be agreeable to God.</P>
<P>Thou art not only to con&s;ider thy Saviour as being perfect in holine&s;s, as a man, but al&s;o as an Almighty God, who by his word created the heavens and the earth, and who can al&s;o bring them to nothing: Who, tho' he is infinite and incomprehen&s;ible, has con|de&s;cended

The &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t may be con&s;idered in a three-&s;old manner, Fir&s;t, In them&s;elves, to move us with com|pa&s;&s;ion, at the &s;ight of his poverty, his mi|&s;ery, his per&s;ecutions, his &s;orrows and pain|ful death upon the cro&s;s. Secondly, By his obedience, his patience, his humility and charity, in a word all tho&s;e virtues which we are called to imitate. Thirdly, In the cau&s;e of his &s;ufferings, which was the ardent love he bore to us, which he manife&s;ted in &s;o &s;triking a manner. It was thro' the effect of this love, to us his creatures, that he lived in &s;o de&s;titute a &s;tate, as not to have whereon to lay his head, <HI>Mat.</HI> viii. 20. and finally ended his life in pain, &s;o that he &s;par|ed nothing, but gave up all freely and wil|lingly for us. There is no mortal man who has &s;o vehement a de&s;ire for life as Je&s;us Chri&s;t had to redeem &s;inners, and to de|liver them from that &s;in, by which they had &s;eparated them&s;elves from him. Ought not this con&s;ideration to incite us to reciprocal love towards him. It is &s;urprizing, that the con&s;ideration of our Saviour's mo&s;t bitter &s;ufferings, doth not inflame our hearts with his love, and penetrate even to the very

bottom of our &s;ouls. But none do te&s;tify more gratitude to God, nor compa&s;&s;ion for the &s;ufferings of our Saviour, than he who labours to imitate him; this is as agreeable to God, as if we gave our life for him. If we &s;ubmit to his cro&s;s, either outwardly or inwardly, this will cau&s;e our proud &s;pirit to bend, under his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of thorns, and our &s;ufferings will produce living fruit in us.</P>
<P>If thou art really de&s;irous to manife&s;t thy gratitude for the infinite goodne&s;s of God, and to bear in thy body the marks of the dying of the Lord Je&s;us, before the world, and in the face of the cele&s;tial armies, <HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 17. thou mu&s;t &s;ubmit to God, without re&s;erve; thou mu&s;t die to thy wandering eyes, thy curious ears, thy vain talk, and to all thy fle&s;hly lu&s;ts, <HI>Col.</HI> iii. 5. thus wilt thy feet be, as it were, nailed to the cro&s;s.

<P>THERE are three &s;orts of cro&s;&s;es which the Almighty di&s;pen&s;es to his chil|dren. The fir&s;t is, when a man is converted to God from the cour&s;e of the world, dies to his evil lu&s;ts, and for&s;akes tho&s;e &s;ins to which he is inclined. This is hard to the fle&s;h, for in this ca&s;e that which was before his plea&s;ure, now becomes his grievous pain.

tryals and cro&s;&s;es.

<P>There are tho&s;e who look outward, when God, by his &s;pirit, would draw them in|ward, and who &s;eek to be inwardly gather|ed, when he calls them to outward &s;ervice; thus they join not with, but re&s;i&s;t God's will.

Some undertake mighty things, &s;o that it appears as tho' they were like to become ex|traordinary people; yet many of the&s;e are apt to return to their old cour&s;e of life, to join with nature and to &s;eek comfort in the creatures.

<P>As many diver&s;ities of di&s;po&s;itions as there are among&s;t men, &s;o many different means doth God u&s;e to lead us to peace.

He will not be in doubt what he ought to do, and will &s;oon overcome all ob&s;tacles, however &s;trange and difficult they may be; &s;uch a &s;tate is of more worth than the mo&s;t &s;ublime exerci&s;es. God will not permit &s;uch a man to go a&s;tray, however dangerous his way may be.</P>
<P>A continual attention to one's &s;elf is dif|ficult in the beginning, but it becomes ea&s;y. When a man truly proves his whole life, his ways, his words and habits, in order to di&s;|cover if they are agreeable to the will of God, he will learn to know him&s;elf and will di&s;cover his &s;ins and be painfully de&s;irous to be delivered from them.</P>
<P>A man of God &s;hould accu&s;tom him&s;elf to have God, as much as po&s;&s;ible, pre&s;ent in his mind. Keep thy &s;pirit in the &s;ame di&s;|po&s;ition, both in the time and out of the time of prayer. Thou oughte&s;t al&s;o when in company, &s;trongly to labour to keep God pre&s;ent in thy mind.

Thou mu&s;t not be &s;atisfied with having thought upon God, as a pa&s;&s;ing object, for &s;uch thoughts &s;oon vani&s;h, and where there is one thought of God, there will be ten others relating to temporal things, which drive away the fir&s;t. Where|fore it is nece&s;&s;ary that we labour vigorou&s;ly to turn our minds entirely towards God, to pre&s;erve a &s;en&s;e of God's pre&s;ence within, with a &s;imple and &s;weet inclination towards him; &s;o that whatever happens to us, we may always maintain an equality of &s;oul, a fidelity and con&s;tant &s;incerity to God, that he in all things may be the principle object of all our actions. Thus none will be able to turn, or &s;eparate us from God. And he who remains thus united to him, will not ea&s;ily be drawn into &s;in. But it is a mo&s;t deplor|able ca&s;e, that almo&s;t every one de&s;cends from that holy mountain, and &s;o far deba&s;es him&s;elf as to be taken up with things of comparitively no worth.

Be careful to ob&s;erve by his light and grace, the pre&s;ence of the divine e&s;&s;ence in thee, how God reveals him&s;elf to thee in him&s;elf, and in all creatures. <HI>Go continually forth from thy &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and activity;</HI> (much is contained in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions) and in or|der more di&s;tinctly to under&s;tand them, thou mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the more thy &s;oul is pour|ed out, thro' the force of rea&s;on and the &s;en&s;es, the more it is filled with imaginati|ons. The more it labours for that which is outward, the more it is weakened and be|comes inwardly &s;ick as to God. For when the inferior faculties attend on their own operations, the &s;oul is obliged to co-operate with them. Here the creatures darken the

<P>We mu&s;t &s;eek God in our&s;elves, by the &s;trength of a cha&s;te love, which gathers up all the powers of the &s;oul, and draws them from all outward di&s;&s;ipations and operations; that we may re-enter the inward re&s;t, and the door may be &s;hut to every figure and image which may di&s;turb the mind.&mdash; Wherefore let us turn our &s;en&s;es, our rea&s;on and our memory with love towards God, in the center of the &s;oul, and there cleave to him, in humble &s;ilent adoration, where all thoughts and imaginations are brought down and &s;ilenced; it is in this interior recollecti|on that grace begins its operation and from whence this pure &s;pirit flows into the facul|ties of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Turn thy&s;elf in this manner towards God, amend thy evil practices, ab&s;tract thy &s;en&s;es, as much as po&s;&s;ible from exterior objects.

<P>Thou oughte&s;t to enter upon the work of thy &s;alvation, with a re&s;olute and un&s;haken mind, which in a lively and cha&s;te love of God, as it were, hates it&s;elf and dying to all creatures, renounces earthly loves, that it may eternally po&s;&s;e&s;s God, in a pure and faithful love.

<P>When the &s;pirit is &s;en&s;ible of the pre&s;ence of God, it goes, as it were, out of it&s;elf, all that it has leaves it, and it plunges it&s;elf into its own nothingne&s;s, even &s;ometimes ima|gining that its intelligence is more &s;tupid than that of the brute creation.

<P>OUR &s;piritual progre&s;s is much hinder|ed thro' giving way to &s;elf-love of any kind, as al&s;o to an unwarrantable affection for any creature whatever. Every love that takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart of man, and which kindles in him the de&s;ire of &s;eeing, hearing, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any thing, that does
<PB N="86" REF="013145_0051_0F8EC2790EA085A8">
not tend to the glory of God, is a di&s;orderly love of the creatures; &s;uch as is the love and de&s;ire after earthly things; money, wealth, hou&s;es, clothes, books, furniture and &s;uch things which we may po&s;&s;e&s;s, or make u&s;e of, for nece&s;&s;ity, or for &s;uperfluity; and which we often &s;eek after thro' fle&s;hly liber|ty; &s;etting our affections thereon, in &s;uch &s;ort, that we bear with impatience to have them taken from us. Such per&s;ons, as the&s;e, are e&s;teemed to have a propriety in tho&s;e things, as they hold them without regard, whether their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of them is, or is not agreeable to the will of God; this &s;ituation is by &s;ome &s;piritual writers called PROPRI|ETY the will of the creature not being &s;ub|&s;ervient to the divine will, which requires of tho&s;e who are truly poor in &s;pirit, that their de&s;ires be &s;o di&s;engaged from what they po&s;&s;e&s;s, as <HI>that they po&s;&s;e&s;s them, as tho' they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them not,</HI> 1 Cor. vii. 29, 31. being ready, freely to give up and for&s;ake all, when God requires it; &s;o that if the&s;e things are taken from them, by God's permi&s;&s;ion, their under&s;tanding and will &s;hould con&s;ent thereto, without murmur.</P>
<P>Another hinderance ari&s;es from the de|&s;ire of riches and honour; from &s;en&s;uality and immoderate indulgence, in eating, drinking, &amp;c. giving way to vain, needle&s;s and uncharitable words and actions; al&s;o in
<PB N="87" REF="013145_0051_0F8EC2790EA085A8">
vain curio&s;ity and other di&s;&s;ipations and di&s;|fu&s;ions of our &s;en&s;es. It is by means of the&s;e things, that we lo&s;e a ta&s;te to &s;piritual ex|erci&s;es; for a &s;en&s;ual man has no reli&s;h for tho&s;e things which belong to the &s;pirit: Here the inferior powers deba&s;e the &s;pirit, and turn it away from the &s;overeign good, cau&s;ing it to take its re&s;t in things that are &s;en&s;ible and vile. Truth allows us all that is nece&s;&s;ary, provided we do not de&s;ire to &s;atisfy our fle&s;hly appetites; for the begin|ning of the &s;piritual life is a death to the na|tural &s;en&s;es; and requires that we turn away from all the creatures in whom we u&s;ed to confide; in order that we may attach our|&s;elves to that which is eternal and divine.</P>
<P>A further hinderance in our &s;piritual pro|gre&s;s lies in <HI>the good opinion we have of our|&s;elves, and our hidden pride,</HI> this often ari&s;es from the e&s;teem we have of our good works, and other religious exerci&s;es; as al&s;o from the &s;weetne&s;s and inward joy we are &s;ome|times &s;en&s;ible of. Here the very progre&s;s &s;uch make in virtue is it&s;elf a cau&s;e of &s;tum|bling to them; this fal&s;e e&s;teem of their vir|tues becomes their chief hinderance, as it proceeds from an heart unmortified, impure and proud; &s;uch per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;s all they have in propriety. They depend more on their own works than on the freedom of the children of God, purcha&s;ed by the precious

&s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, in which alone, they ought to &s;eek for peace and re&s;t, <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 24, 25. Hence they fall into pride; &s;eek a vain reputation; look upon them&s;elves as of con&s;equence and are too ready to judge other people with &s;ourne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash; There is nothing &s;o hurtful in a &s;piritual life as pride and &s;elf-love; this ca&s;ts many into perdition who had made a good begin|ning and been once divinely favoured.</P>
<P>There al&s;o ari&s;es a great ob&s;truction to an e&s;tabli&s;hment in religion from a de&s;ire which prevails in &s;ome to be e&s;teemed and favoured by men, <HI>James</HI> iv. 4. Many, from a de&s;ire of the&s;e things, do that which they ought not to do, and omit to do what they ought, in order to gain favour, or avoid being ex|po&s;ed to the je&s;t, the &s;corn and hatred of men; the&s;e forget the apo&s;tolick advice, <HI>Gal.</HI> i. 10. <HI>Do I &s;eek to plea&s;e men? for if I yet plea&s;ed men, I &s;hould not be the &s;ervant of Chri&s;t.</HI> Such if they do not humble them&s;elves and amend, will &s;uffer an irreparable damage.</P>
<P>An inordinate care for and de&s;ire of earthly things, is al&s;o often a con&s;iderable hinderance; the apo&s;tle tells the believers, <HI>That he that goeth to war does not entangle him&s;elf in the affairs of this life,</HI> Tim. ii. 2, 4. Neverthele&s;s mo&s;t are &s;olicitous, and even torment them&s;elves to attain to many things they do not really &s;tand in need of: In the&s;e the inclination is

The&s;e things ob&s;cure our faith in, and dependance on God; le&s;&s;en our charity to our neighbour, and expo&s;e us to many temptations and &s;nares of the devil, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> vi. 9.&mdash;We mu&s;t al&s;o be very careful to pre&s;erve our hearts from bad or vain thoughts, and even from &s;uch thoughts, which tho' not evil in them&s;elves, yet are not of u&s;e.

Tho&s;e bad thoughts and &s;ugge&s;tions proceed from the enemy and altho' we may not wholly give our&s;elves up to them, yet where they are in|dulged, they are a great hinderance to true piety and tend to drive away the holy &s;pirit. They manife&s;tly &s;hew that there is a want of mortification, and that a &s;ufficient watch is not kept. If a &s;ufficient degree of zeal prevailed we could not thus abu&s;e our time; but the&s;e thoughts would, thro' divine help, be drove away and the heart continually

recur to the contemplation of Chri&s;t, and meditation of his &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>The&s;e hinderances and many more, which might be mentioned, mu&s;t &s;ooner or later be mortified, and entirely &s;tripped off, thro' the divine power, <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 12. The rea&s;on that they &s;till live in us, is becau&s;e we do not clo&s;ely enough ob&s;erve and watch over the inward &s;tate of our hearts. The foundation of the heavenly life lies in retirement, &s;ilence, tranquillity and a continual attention to the voice of God &s;peaking inwardly to our hearts.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who voluntarily indulge them&s;elves in the&s;e evil di&s;po&s;itions, either in whole, or in part, will &s;till remain alive, unto &s;in, nor will they be delivered, notwith&s;tanding their confe&s;&s;ion of them, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxviii. 13. Even the good works of &s;uch people are defiled with &s;in; they can make no progre&s;s in the &s;piritual life: For the vices to which they are &s;till attached, are like &s;o many thick veils, black and hard, which cover the eyes of the &s;oul, &s;o that they know not them&s;elves; for the light of grace cannot enlighten them, becau&s;e this covering of their inward eyes and ears hinders them, &s;o from &s;eeing and hearing that they will excu&s;e and even vindicate their practice, which occa&s;ions their &s;till remaining under captivity to &s;in. The tye by which they are united to the light is &s;o &s;mall, that they ea&s;i|ly fall into great &s;ins, and there is &s;carce one among&s;t an hundred of &s;uch per&s;ons, but are
<PB N="91" REF="013145_0053_0F8EC279EFCB3EA8">
carried away by death, before they are pre|pared. If we could but &s;en&s;ibly feel the de|plorable &s;tate of &s;uch &s;ouls, who after they have been in a good degree enlightened, give way to &s;uch evil indulgences, we &s;hould very much dread the dangerous con&s;equences of voluntarily giving way to commit even one &s;in. On the other hand, how happy is that &s;oul who dies to it&s;elf; how pure, how cha&s;te and free from &s;in and of all inordinate de&s;ire; how quiet and free from pain and fear; united to God in &s;pirit here and eternally hereafter.</P>
<P>The &s;um of what has been &s;aid, is contain|ed in two expre&s;&s;ions, that is in <HI>&s;elf-love</HI> and in <HI>the love of God.</HI> Self-love &s;eeks its own advantage. The love of God &s;eeks his will and glory, and the advantage of others. So much love as a man has to God &s;o much does he de&s;pi&s;e him&s;elf, and &s;o much does he renounce his own will, thro' the power of God. Self-love can go &s;o far as to cau&s;e us to de&s;pi&s;e God; and the love of God can &s;o encrea&s;e, that we come &s;o to hate our&s;elves, and our own will, that in all things we wholly renounce our&s;elves for the love of God:&mdash;Hence it clearly appears that <HI>&s;elf-love</HI> and the <HI>love of the creatures</HI> and of <HI>&s;in,</HI> is the &s;pring which defileth the heart, and ca&s;ts it into trouble and di&s;order.

joining with the calls of grace, become will|ing to give up their whole hearts to follow its dictates. This pious lady's fir&s;t principle appears to have been the glory of God, and the purity of her own heart; next to this, a continual &s;olicitude and labour to hold all her capacities, all her power, and all her fortunes continually upon the &s;tretch for the good of all men, weeping with tho&s;e that wept; re|joicing with tho&s;e that rejoiced; given to the ho&s;pitality; di&s;tributing to the nece&s;&s;ities of &s;aints, and to tho&s;e that were le&s;s &s;o, having joy at the conver&s;ion of a &s;inner, or the lea&s;t appearance of it; but the care of all her cares was the &s;tranger; the fatherle&s;s and the widow; the needy, and he that hath no helper; the lame, the halt and the blind.&mdash; And in this place, &s;ays the author of her life, what &s;hall I &s;ay! or how can I expect to be believed! The bent of her &s;pirit ever lay to|wards the&s;e: She had a &s;hare in all their &s;ufferings; &s;he would often conver&s;e with them, and enquire into their hi&s;tory with as much poverty of &s;pirit, as they were in of outward condition; &s;he would &s;tudy their particular ca&s;es, and put them in the way of better welfare; &s;ome of the&s;e were ever in her hou&s;e, and frequently in great numbers; and it was no neglect of her's, if any one went away unrelieved with meat, phy&s;ic, raiment or money; many of the&s;e that lived

remote, had yearly allowances, and large &s;ums i&s;&s;ued out into di&s;tant parts of the kingdom. Her &s;till larger applications were fixed pen&s;ions upon reduced families, the maintenance of her own charity-&s;chool, con|tributions to others, &amp;c. &amp;c. She was a great mi&s;tre&s;s of all parts of oeconomy with re&s;pect to what &s;he laid out upon her&s;elf; her body, &s;he knew, was the temple of the Holy Gho&s;t, which the believer mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s in &s;anctifica|tion and honour, wherefore her &s;upport of it in meat, drink and &s;leep, was ever bound|ed by nece&s;&s;ity; for they that walk in the &s;pirit, as this pious lady did, die progre&s;&s;ively to every vanity, and dare not indulge the hurtful gratifications of the fle&s;h, but labour to keep it under, as knowing it to be the &s;eat and repo&s;itory of their mo&s;t dangerous and deadly enemy. Neverthele&s;s &s;he &s;ought not her &s;alvation by the force of her alms, highly affluent as they were; for the&s;e, though nece&s;&s;ary duties, yet, &s;he well knew, were not the charity of the go&s;pel; not that charity which the apo&s;tle Paul &s;o divinely de&s;cribes at 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii. 3. She was &s;en&s;ible, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t mu&s;t be revealed in the heart, before we can have any ju&s;t claim to di&s;ciple&s;hip, and that it is his ruling and bringing all things therein &s;ubjection to his &s;pirit, that was the great and only principle of chri&s;tian charity.&mdash;She knew, that the
<PB N="107" REF="013145_0061_0F8EC2820BD24690">
great &s;cene of religion lay within, in the right government of the heart; accordingly her eye was ever upon her heart, to &s;ee that all its principles were clean&s;ed from evil mix|tures, had no taint from &s;elf-love, were not &s;ullied with vain-glory; her care was to ob|&s;erve the tendency of all its motions, how its &s;truggles weakened in &s;inful de&s;ires, endea|vouring continually to nouri&s;h it by acts of faith in the blood of her Redeemer. She had well learnt to overcome evil with good, to &s;uffer long, and be kind, to bear all things, and if ever by &s;peech, carriage or otherwi&s;e, &s;he &s;u&s;pected that &s;he had di&s;turbed the &s;pi|rit of any, &s;he had no peace with her&s;elf, till &s;he had taken care for the recovery of theirs.</P>
<P>Much more might be &s;aid of the endow|ments and virtues of this true di&s;ciple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, more e&s;pecially of her patience under &s;ufferings, and re&s;ignation to the di|vine will; under the painful di&s;pen&s;ation &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through, during the la&s;t eighteen months of her life, occa&s;ioned by a cancer in her brea&s;t, which, notwith&s;tanding &s;he &s;uf|fered it to be &s;eparated from her body, yet in the end occa&s;ioned her death. This pain|ful operation &s;he not only bore with pati|ence, but even rejoiced, that &s;he was count|ed worthy to &s;uffer, knowing her Saviour had &s;uffered in his fle&s;h, and that as &s;uffer|ings was the way to his perfection, it mu&s;t

al&s;o be the way to ours, this being the de|clared condition of our being glorified with him, the true&s;t marks of adoption, and the mo&s;t &s;overeign medicine &s;ent from heaven for our cure. The&s;e truths this truly pious lady was &s;o well acquainted with, that &s;he declared, <HI>She would not wi&s;h to be out of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, nor exchange it for any other at any price.</HI> Thus with great meekne&s;s and tranquillity, with chearfulne&s;s &s;carce to be believed, in perfect &s;erenity and freedom, &s;he continued her u&s;ual life, till the time ap|pointed for the operation. When that time of deep trial came, &s;he &s;hewed no reluctance or &s;truggle, but endured all even without complaint; only towards the end &s;he drew &s;uch a &s;igh, as the compa&s;&s;ionate reader who reads this, may do. Hence it appears, how tho&s;e that follow the Lamb with &s;incerity, are endowed with virtue and power re&s;ulting from the true &s;pirit of his religion, which others are unacquainted with. The night following the operation was not indeed a night of much &s;leep, but of truly cele&s;tial re&s;t; a night of thank&s;giving to her God, for the vi&s;ible demon&s;tration of his power in her, and about her, for his &s;tretched-out arm in her great deliverance, for the bountiful provi&s;ion he had made for the body and &s;oul, holding all the powers of her &s;pirit exerci&s;|ed in acts of love, gratitude and adoration.

She &s;ooner than was expected got upon her feet, and with every improvement that could be made, into the &s;ame way of life, that &s;he had been in before, wholly intent upon the glory of God, and the good of her fellow-creatures. But the di&s;temper only repre&s;&s;ed for a time, ro&s;e up with new malignity, to the much greater affliction of numbers in the world, than of her that bore it; for &s;he had now been, for &s;ome time, in the &s;chool of affliction, exerci&s;ed with its &s;harp di&s;ci|pline, and found its &s;alutary effects. Under the&s;e &s;entiments her hope was full of im|mortality, and the eternal weight of glory, now in full view, made all her afflictions light. In this near and certain approach of death, her cheri&s;hing warmth, like that of the &s;un, tho' it might be mo&s;t felt by tho&s;e neare&s;t, yet al&s;o reached tho&s;e at greater di&s;tance; witne&s;s the great number of letters &s;he writ, and dictated to others, when &s;he became unable to write, full of &s;weet coun&s;el, having for their argument the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of piety; pre&s;&s;ing home the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of it, and &s;etting forth its true na|ture; witne&s;s al&s;o the number of per&s;ons of all conditions, who re&s;orted at her hou&s;e, to behold the living power of religion in her, and to be benefited by her wi&s;dom.

life was near drawing to its la&s;t &s;tage, but her lamp and her life mu&s;t be extingui&s;hed together, and &s;he mu&s;t occupy till her Lord comes.&mdash;Accordingly &s;he convened her hou&s;hold, to &s;trengthen and enforce every thing that &s;he had done or &s;hewn them be|fore, by her dying coun&s;els; and would have extended this care to the whole village, but was re&s;trained by the phy&s;ician. <HI>The path of the ju&s;t is as a &s;hining light, which &s;hin|eth more and more unto the perfect day.</HI> <Q>The truly religious, who&s;e evidences for hea|ven are clear, rational, and well grounded, have a tide of joy &s;pringing up in their minds beyond expre&s;&s;ion; &s;omething more moving and &s;atisfactory than any one can imagine, but they that perceive it.&mdash;When they are ju&s;t entering upon the promi&s;ed land, the &s;plendor of the eternal day dawns upon them, and &s;hines as thro' the breaches of their &s;hattered bodies, and rai&s;es in the inward man &s;uch earne&s;t of happine&s;s, &s;uch foreta&s;tes of joy, as enables them to pa&s;s thro' the val|ley of death in peace and triumph.</Q> As death drew near, &s;he was in tran&s;port, quite melted down with the impre&s;&s;ion of glory, broke out with a rai&s;ed accent into the&s;e words: <HI>Ble&s;s me,</HI> Lord! <HI>What is that I &s;ee!

And if it be a&s;ked, what the&s;e are?

And at the &s;ame time per|ceiving the greatne&s;s of my mi&s;ery and po|verty, I in&s;i&s;t the more upon the merits of our Saviour, and re&s;olve to re&s;t contented, tho' it &s;hould plea&s;e him to leave me all the days of my life in &s;uch a condition. But he never lets me continue long under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, and if I may venture &s;o to &s;peak, he cannot forbear loving me, any more than I can live without him.</P>
<P>If I am per&s;uaded on holidays to be merry in company, I excu&s;e my&s;elf. For nothing can be compared to the plea&s;ures of my love, which are &s;o much the &s;weeter and greater for my withdrawing from all company what&s;oever. If people wonder, how I can &s;tay always at home alone, I think within my&s;elf: O! if you knew the glorious com|pany I have, you would not &s;ay that I was alone; for I am never le&s;s alone, than when I have nobody with me.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="013145_0066_0F8EC2851EB6ABC0">The night coming on, and every one go|ing to re&s;t, I find re&s;t only in the arms of di|vine love: I &s;leep leaning on his holy brea&s;t, like a child in his mother's bo&s;om. I &s;ay, I go to &s;leep, but being &s;till bu&s;ied about the love and prai&s;es of my God, till I fall quite a&s;leep. Many times this love rou&s;es up all my &s;en&s;es, &s;o that I cannot &s;leep the greate&s;t part of the night, but I &s;pend it in the em|braces of the grace of God, which never for|&s;akes &s;uch a poor mi&s;erable creature as I am, but pre&s;erves me, and takes &s;pecial care of me.</P>
<P>If in the night the evil &s;pirits hover about, to torment or to &s;urpri&s;e me, (which often happens) this divine love guards me, and fights for me. Yea, he gives me grace too, to re&s;i&s;t them courageou&s;ly, as if I were awake. For they &s;eldom continue long to a&s;&s;ault me, unle&s;s it be in my &s;leep.</P>
<P>And this is the life I have led for the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t, without perceiving the lea&s;t change of that love which was poured out into my heart, after my &s;incere conver|&s;ion unto him. Nay, I have ob&s;erved its daily increa&s;e, tho' every day it &s;eemed im|po&s;&s;ible to endure any addition to what I already enjoy. But truly, it is an infinite love, which &s;atisfies and nouri&s;hes me, &s;o that every day I have a new hunger, tho'
<PB N="118" REF="013145_0067_0F8EC2891ED02348">
methinks I can receive no more, than what I po&s;&s;e&s;s already every moment.</P>
<P>THE author of her life &s;ays, concerning the manner of her expre&s;&s;ions, that they were always very mode&s;t, without any noi&s;e or vehemence: her common di&s;cour&s;es were always holy and edifying; whereas others too commonly mis-&s;pend their time in u&s;e|le&s;s conver&s;ation and unprofitable talk.</P>
<P>For a long while &s;he could bear no other di&s;cour&s;e but of God and his holy love. <HI>I I cannot imagine,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>how a &s;oul, created for heaven, can be concerned about the dro&s;s of this world.</HI> From that time, if &s;he happen|ed to be in company, where the &s;ubject of the di&s;cour&s;e was but indifferent, either &s;he did not mind it at all, entertaining her&s;elf in the mean while with God; or, as &s;oon as &s;he thought it proper, &s;he diverted and changed the di&s;cour&s;e; thinking it but lo&s;t time, which was &s;pent in the trifles of this world.</P>
<P>To every body that had a mind to be ac|quainted with God Almighty &s;he gave this advice: To be &s;ilent, and to learn to keep their thoughts together in the center of the heart: for this (&s;aid &s;he) is the beginning of our union with God, and by the&s;e means the &s;oul forgets earthly things, and rai&s;es her&s;elf up to the contemplation of heavenly
<PB N="119" REF="013145_0067_0F8EC2891ED02348">
objects. We ought to lo&s;e our familiarity with the creatures, if we de&s;ire to enjoy the conver&s;ation of the Creator; a moment of which doth afford more delight and &s;atis|faction, than all the fine&s;t di&s;cour&s;es in the world.</P>
<P>The real experience &s;he had of the inward and &s;piritual life of grace, and of the mani|fold operations it was attended with, doth abundantly appear from the larger account of her life and conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>One time when her mi&s;tre&s;s was afraid that Armelle was like to run quite mad by an exce&s;s of devotion, &s;he forbad her all &s;pi|ritual exerci&s;es, and would not let her go even to church, except on the Lord's day only: Armelle, being &s;en&s;ible of the fal&s;e &s;tep her mi&s;tre&s;s took, &s;miled within her&s;elf, &s;aying, Truly, I am not mad, after I have found my beloved, whom I now love with all my heart. I remember a time, when I was &s;eeking only God without me, and then I was mad indeed.&mdash;This mi&s;tre&s;s of hers being of a &s;our and moro&s;e humour, &s;hewed a deal of ill-nature to Armelle, of which, however, &s;he never complained, but rather thanked God, that he was plea&s;ed to make this a means of her fuller purification. Some &s;eeing what &s;he &s;uffered in that hou&s;e, advi&s;ed her entirely to quit that place; &s;he replied, according to her u&s;ual earne&s;tne&s;s:
<PB N="120" REF="013145_0068_0F8EC28A0762E268">
Why &s;hould you have me to flee from the cro&s;s which the Lord him&s;elf has entailed upon me? No, by no means: I &s;hall never do it, except they turn me away by force. In which unexpected an&s;wer her friends en|tirely aquie&s;ced, never prompting her again to quit a place where &s;he had daily opportu|nity to practi&s;e patience and &s;elf-denial; vir|tues &s;o much contrary to the whole bent of corrupt nature, and yet &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for rightly framing a chri&s;tian life and conver|&s;ation. At another time &s;he &s;aid: If the &s;oul be but well grounded in the favour of God, and lively affected with the operations of his grace, all the in&s;ults of the devil, and of the creatures, are borne with joy and comfort. But this is mi&s;ery indeed, when the Lord him&s;elf withdraws from the &s;oul, and lets her &s;hift for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>In what company &s;oever &s;he was, &s;he talk|ed of nothing more, than of being <HI>faithful to God.</HI> Nothing dropped more from her mouth, than, <HI>Let us be faithful, let us be faith|ful to the Lord.</HI> This word &s;he thought &s;it for any time, and &s;uitable to every company. Being a&s;ked by her friends, whether &s;he had nothing el&s;e to &s;ay, &s;he an&s;wered: Don't wonder at my &s;aying this over and over again. If I &s;hould live a thou&s;and years, I &s;hould &s;till tell you the &s;ame thing. For 'tis faithfulne&s;s, wherein the perfection of a chri&s;tian life con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="013145_0068_0F8EC28A0762E268">Of the con&s;training power of the divine love &s;he has the following expre&s;&s;ion: When|ever I happened to adhere a little too much to my natural inclinations, (apt to &s;teal in upon the mind under the &s;pecious pretence of nece&s;&s;ity) I was immediately reproved by the love of God. This divine love is like a careful tutor, who takes all the pains imagi|nable for advancing his pupil in the way of learning he is engaged in; and for this rea|&s;on keeps his eye con&s;tantly fixed on him, both to correct his failings, though never &s;o &s;mall, and to prevent his being led away by any thing that might divert him from his chief employment. Thus, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> dealt the Lord with me. He kept me clo&s;ely confined to an holy awe and warine&s;s; and when I happened by one over&s;ight or other to with|draw, as it were, from his eye, he in that very moment pur&s;ued after me, and recalled me to my duty. But all this was done with &s;o much love and tenderne&s;s, that it mu&s;t be a heart of bra&s;s, if not mollified by &s;uch endearing marks of love and kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>She often wondered at &s;ome people's dila|tory doings in the &s;ervice of God, and &s;aid, it was a cunning fetch and &s;tratagem of the devil, to make people put off from one day to another &s;uch de&s;igns as might &s;erve to advance the glory of God, and the good of our fellow-creatures. <HI>For,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>if often
<PB N="122" REF="013145_0069_0F8EC28AE8DD22C8">
happens that grace which at one hour offers it&s;elf to a man, in order to &s;upport him under &s;ome diffi|cult enterpri&s;es, is not &s;o ea&s;ily met with at ano|ther time.</HI> And be&s;ides this, how uncertain is our life! nay, if we were &s;ure to live longer, yet ought we not to linger upon that account at all, nor to defer from one day to another what might be done this day. A man that is full of delays in the &s;ervice of God, mu&s;t needs have but little love at the bottom. <HI>Wherever love is rai&s;ed to any con&s;ide|rable degree, there the &s;oul can't re&s;t, whil&s;t there remains any thing to be done required by the beloved.</HI>&mdash;And this dilatory temper, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> was a great impediment in the way of perfection. Many &s;ouls were convinced of the will of God, but being too backward con&s;tantly to &s;truggle again&s;t the corrupt propen&s;ities of their dull and lazy temper, they made but a &s;low progre&s;s in the work of religion. They &s;ay, to-morrow, to-mor|row it &s;hall be done in good earne&s;t; but that to-morrow never comes. The con&s;e|quence whereof is, that the longer they flat|ter them&s;elves in their di&s;orderly and wont|ed cu&s;toms, the le&s;s able they are to re&s;i&s;t them at la&s;t at all: the Lord leaves them now to their own will, &s;ince they did not improve faithfully what once they had re|ceived.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="013145_0069_0F8EC28AE8DD22C8">Her humility was al&s;o grounded on a true and &s;olid foundation. She confe&s;&s;es, that the infinite love of God kept her undefiled as to the vanity of pride. I was a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;ays &s;he, when I was told to watch again&s;t pride, for I thought whil&s;t I was well in my wits, I could not po&s;&s;ibly be proud. I was &s;o fully convinced that every thing really good was from God, that if all angels and men had offered to per&s;uade me to the contrary, I &s;hould never have believed them.&mdash;And this &s;en&s;e fortified me again&s;t every kind of pride.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e her love to God was &s;o great and fervent, the love &s;he bore to her fellow-crea|tures was al&s;o wonderfully influenced and inflamed thereby.&mdash;When &s;he con&s;idered the woful &s;tate of the wicked, and the dread|ful judgment that is like to befal them at la&s;t, &s;he then felt a more tender and com|mi&s;erating love, and her very bowels began to yearn for compa&s;&s;ion.

<HEAD>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE PLAGUE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST the many calamities with which the Almighty is plea&s;ed to vi&s;it the children of men, in order to reduce them to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their own weakne&s;s and entire dependence upon him, there is &s;carce any that are more productive of true penitent humilia|tion, and of a &s;ight of what is really good and truly evil, than tho&s;e contagious di&s;tempers, which an offended God &s;ometimes &s;uffers to rage among&s;t the people. In the year 1665 the city of <HI>London</HI> was &s;orely vi&s;ited by the plague: An account of the progre&s;s and effects of that vi&s;itation was kept by a citizen who remained there during the whole time of the &s;ickne&s;s, and appears to have been candid and judici|ous in his remarks thereon. I tru&s;t my read|ers may, in a &s;hort de&s;cription of that memo|rable judgment, meet with &s;uch le&s;&s;ons of be&s;t wi&s;dom, which nothing can &s;o effectually pro|duce, as a clo&s;e and &s;erious conver&s;e with death and the grave. The introduction of this con|tagion in <HI>London</HI> was by &s;ome goods imported from <HI>Holland,</HI> which had been brought thither from the <HI>Levant.</HI> It fir&s;t broke out in the
<PB N="3" REF="013145_0072_0F8EC28C783B3F98">
hou&s;e where tho&s;e goods were opened, from whence it &s;pread to other hou&s;es. In the fir&s;t hou&s;e that was infected there died four per&s;ons: A neighbour who went to vi&s;it them returning home, gave the di&s;temper to her family, and died with all her hou&s;hold. The pari&s;h officers who were employed about the &s;ick per&s;ons be|ing al&s;o infected, the phy&s;icians perceived the danger, and, upon narrow in&s;pection, a&s;&s;ured, that it was indeed the plague with all its terri|fying particulars, and that it threatened a ge|neral infection. The people began now to be alarmed all over the town; the u&s;ual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week were generally about 240 to 300, but from the 17th to the 24th Jan. the printed bill was 474. However this went off again, and the fro&s;t continuing very &s;evere till near the end of February, the bills decrea&s;ed again, and people began to look upon the danger as good as over; but in May the bills greatly increa&s;ed, and the weather becoming hot, the infection &s;pread again, in a dreadful manner.</P>
<P>I lived, &s;ays the author, without Aldgate, and as the di&s;temper had not reached to that &s;ide of the city, our neighbourhood continued ea&s;y; but at the other end of the town the con&s;ternation was very great, and the nobility and gentry thronged out of the town with their families in an unu&s;ual manner; nothing was to be &s;een but waggons, carts and coaches with goods and people, and hor&s;e-men attending them, hurrying away; then empty waggons
<PB N="4" REF="013145_0073_0F8EC28D63AD9B20">
and carts appeared, who were apparently re|turning to fetch more people, be&s;ides innumer|able numbers of people on hor&s;eback, fitted out for travelling. This was a very melan|choly pro&s;pect; indeed there was nothing el&s;e of moment to be &s;een; it filled my mind with very &s;erious thoughts of the mi&s;ery that was coming upon the city, and the unhappy con|dition of tho&s;e that would be left in it. By the end of July the contagion had &s;pread and in|crea&s;ed to a great degree: Sorrow and &s;adne&s;s &s;at upon every face; and though &s;ome parts were not yet overwhelmed, all looked deeply concerned. <HI>London</HI> might well be &s;aid to be all in tears, the mourners did not go about the &s;treets, for nobody made a formal dre&s;s of mourning for their neare&s;t relations, but the voice of mourning was indeed heard in the &s;treets; the &s;hrieks of women and children at the windows and doors of their hou&s;es where their deare&s;t relations were dying, were &s;o fre|quent to be heard as we pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treets, that it was enough to pierce the &s;toute&s;t heart in the world. Tears and lamentations were &s;een almo&s;t in every hou&s;e, e&s;pecialiy in the fir&s;t part of the vi&s;itation; for towards the latter end people did not &s;o much concern them&s;elves for the lo&s;s of their friends, expecting that them&s;elves would be &s;ummoned the next hour.</P>
<P>It was a time of very unhappy breaches a|mong&s;t us; in matters of religion, divi&s;ions and &s;eparate opinions prevailed; the Church of <HI>England</HI> was lately re&s;tored, and the Pre&s;|byterians
<PB N="5" REF="013145_0073_0F8EC28D63AD9B20">
and other profe&s;&s;ions had &s;et up their meetings for wor&s;hip, apart, in which they were frequently di&s;turbed, the government endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;s their meetings. But this dreadful vi&s;itation reconciled the different parties, and took away all manner of prejudice and &s;cruple from the people. But after the &s;ick|ne&s;s was over, that &s;pirit of charity &s;ub&s;ided, and things returned to their own channel again. Here we may ob&s;erve, that a nearer view of death would &s;oon reconcile men of good prin|ciples to one another, and that it is chiefly owing to our ea&s;y &s;ituations in life, and our putting the&s;e things far from us, that our breaches are &s;omented, and that there is &s;o much prejudice and want of chri&s;tian charity and union among&s;t us. A clo&s;e view and conver&s;e with death, or with di&s;ea&s;es that threaten death, would &s;cum off the gall of our temper, remove our animo|&s;ities, and bring us to &s;ee with different eyes. On the other &s;ide of the grave we &s;hall all be brethren again.</P>
<P>The inns of court were now all &s;hut up, there was but few lawyers to be &s;een in the city, indeed there was no need of them, for quarrels and divi&s;ions about intere&s;t had cea&s;ed; every body was at peace.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o worthy of ob&s;ervation, as well as fruitful of in&s;truction, to ob&s;erve with what alacrity the people of all per&s;ua&s;ions embraced the opportunities they had of attending upon the publick wor&s;hip, and other appointed times of devotion, as humiliations, fa&s;tings and pub|lick
<PB N="6" REF="013145_0074_0F8EC28DDFC37070">
confe&s;&s;ions of &s;ins, to implore the mercy of God, and avert the judgment which hung over their heads. The churches were &s;o throng|ed, that there was often no coming near, no, not to the very door of the large&s;t churches. There was al&s;o daily prayers appointed morn|ing and evening, at which the people attended with uncommon devotion.</P>
<P>All plays and interludes which had lately began to increa&s;e among&s;t us, were forbid to act; the gaming-tables, publick dancing-rooms and mu&s;ick-hou&s;es, which multiplied and be|gan to debauch the manners of the people, were &s;hut up and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, finding indeed no trade; for the minds of the people were generally humbled and agitated with other things, death was before their eyes, and every body began to think of their graves.</P>
<P>The infection &s;till gradually increa&s;ed till the middle of Augu&s;t, when there died a thou&s;and a day, by account of the weekly bills, though they never gave a full account by many thou|&s;ands; many of the pari&s;h officers were taken &s;ick them&s;elves and died when their account was to be given in. The pari&s;h of Stepney alone had within the year, one hundred and &s;ix|teen &s;extons, grave-diggers and carriers of the dead, &amp;c. Indeed the work was not of a na|ture to allow them lei&s;ure to take an exact tale of the dead bodies, which were all thrown to|gether in the dark in a pit, to which no man could come near without the utmo&s;t peril.</P>
<P>I had, &s;ays the author, the care of my bro|ther's
<PB N="7" REF="013145_0074_0F8EC28DDFC37070">
hou&s;e, which obliged me &s;ometimes to go abroad. In the&s;e walks I had di&s;mal &s;cenes before my eyes, as, particularly, of per&s;ons falling dead in the &s;treets, terrible &s;hrieks of women, who in their agonies would throw open their chamber-windows, and cry out in a di&s;mal &s;urpri&s;ing manner; it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the variety of po&s;tures in which the pa&s;&s;ions of the poor people would expre&s;s them&s;elves. Pa&s;&s;ing through Token-Hou&s;e yard, of a &s;udden a ca&s;ement violently opened ju&s;t over my head, and a woman gave three frightful &s;creeches, and then cry'd: <HI>Oh! Death, Death, Death,</HI> which &s;truck me with horror and a chilne&s;s in my very blood. There was nobody to be &s;een in the whole &s;treet, neither did any window open, for people had no curi|o&s;ity now in any ca&s;e. I went on to pa&s;s into <HI>Bell-Alley,</HI> where there was a greater cry than that; I could hear women and children run &s;creaming about the rooms like di&s;tracted, when a garret-window opened, and &s;omebody from a window on the other &s;ide a&s;ked, <HI>What is the matter?</HI> Upon which it was an&s;wered, <HI>Oh Lord! my old ma&s;ter has hanged him&s;elf.</HI> The other a&s;ked again, <HI>Is he quite dead?</HI> And the fir&s;t an&s;wered, <HI>Ay, ay quite dead and cold.</HI> This per&s;on was a Deputy-Alderman and very rich. But this is but one in&s;tance; it is &s;carce credi|ble what dreadful ca&s;es happened in particular families every day. People in the rage of the di&s;temper or in the torment of the &s;welling, which was indeed intolerable, becoming raving

and di&s;tracted, oftentimes laid violent hands upon them&s;elves, throwing them&s;elves out of windows, or breaking out of the hou&s;es, would dance naked about the &s;treets, not knowing one exta&s;y from another; others, if not pre|vented, would run directly down to the river, and plunge into the water. Some dying of mere grief as a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ome of fright and &s;urprize, without having received the infection. It often pierced my very &s;oul, to hear the groans and cries of tho&s;e who were thus tor|mented; but this of the &s;wellings was account|ed the mo&s;t promi&s;ing particular in the whole infection; for if the&s;e &s;wellings could be brought to break and run, the patient generally reco|vered. Whereas tho&s;e who were &s;truck with death at the beginning of the di&s;temper, and had &s;pots come upon them, often went about indifferent ea&s;y, till a little before they died, and &s;ome till the moment they dropt down; &s;uch would be taken &s;uddenly very &s;ick, and would run to &s;ome convenient place, or to their own hou&s;es if po&s;&s;ible, and there &s;it down, grow faint and die.</P>
<P>Death did not now hover over every one's head only, but looked into their hou&s;es and chambers, and even &s;tared in their very faces; and though there was &s;ome &s;tupidity and dul|ne&s;s of mind, yet there was a great deal of ju&s;t alarm &s;ounded in the inmo&s;t &s;oul: Many con|&s;ciences were awakened; many hard hearts melted into tears; many a penitent confe&s;&s;ion was made of crimes long concealed.

might be heard even in the &s;treets as we pa&s;&s;ed along calling upon God for mercy, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;aying: I have been a thief; I have been an adulterer; I have been a mur|derer, and the like; and none dur&s;t &s;top to make inquiry into &s;uch things, or to admini|&s;ter comfort to the poor creature, who in the angui&s;h both of &s;oul and body thus cried out. Many were the warnings that were then given by dying penitents to others, not to put off and delay their repentance to a day of di&s;tre&s;s, that &s;uch a time of calamity as this was no time for repentance. I wi&s;h, &s;ays the author, I could repeat the very &s;ound of tho&s;e groans and ex|clamations that I heard from &s;ome poor dying creatures, when in the height of their agonies and di&s;tre&s;s, and that I could make him that reads this, hear as I imagine, I now hear them, for the &s;ound &s;eems &s;till to ring in my ears. In the beginning of September the number of burials increa&s;ing, the church-wardens of Ald|gate pari&s;h ordered a large pit to be dug, to hold all the dead which might die in a month, it was about forty feet long and &s;ixteen broad; &s;ome blamed the church-wardens for &s;uffering &s;uch a frightful gulf to be dug; neverthele&s;s in two weeks they had thrown more than eleven hundred bodies into it, when they were obliged to fill it up, as the bodies were come within &s;ix feet of the &s;urface. My curio&s;ity drove me to go and &s;ee this pit, when there had been near four hundred people buried in it. I got admittance into the church-yard, by

means of the &s;exton, who was a &s;en&s;ible, reli|gious man. He would have per&s;uaded me not to go, &s;aying, <HI>That it was indeed their duty to venture, and in it they might hope to be pre&s;erved; but that, as I had no apparent call, he thought, my curio&s;ity could not ju&s;tify my running that hazard.</HI> I told him, <HI>I had been pre&s;&s;ed in my mind to go, and that perhaps it might be an in&s;tructing &s;ight. Nay,</HI> &s;ays the good man, <HI>if you will venture upon that &s;core, in the name of</HI> God <HI>go in; it will be a &s;ermon to you, it may be the be&s;t you ever heard in your life.</HI> His di&s;cour&s;es had &s;hock'd my re&s;o|lution, and I &s;tood wavering for a good while; but ju&s;t then I heard the bell-man, and the cart, loaded with dead bodies, appearing, I went in. There was nobody, as I could perceive, at fir&s;t with the cart but the buriers, and the man that led the cart; but when they came to the pit, they &s;aw a man muffled in a cloak who appeared in great agony; the buriers immediately gather|ed about him, &s;uppo&s;ing he was one of tho&s;e poor delirious or de&s;perate creatures, that would &s;ometimes run to the pit, wrapt in blan|kets, and throw them&s;elves in, and as they &s;aid, bury them&s;elves. When the buriers came to him, they &s;oon found he was neither de&s;perate nor di&s;tempered in mind, but one oppre&s;&s;ed with a dreadful weight of grief, having his wife and &s;everal children all in the cart, that was ju&s;t come in with him, and he followed in agony and exce&s;s of &s;orrow. He calmly de|&s;ired the buriers to let him alone, &s;aid he would only &s;ee the bodies thrown in, and go away;

He looked into the pit again, as he went away, but the buriers had covered the bodies &s;o immediately with throwing earth, that nothing could be &s;een. The cart had in it &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen bodies. Some were wrapt up in linen &s;heets, &s;ome in rugs, &s;ome little other than naked, or &s;o loo&s;e, that what covering they had fell from them, in the &s;hooting out of the cart, and they fell quite naked among the re&s;t; but the matter was not much to them, or the indecency much to any one el&s;e, &s;eeing they were to be huddled to|gether into the common grave of mankind; for here was no difference made, but poor and rich went together; there was no other way of burials, neither was it po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould.</P>
<P><HI>John Hayward,</HI> under-&s;exton, that is, grave digger and bearer of the dead, never had the di&s;temper at all, but lived about twenty years after it. His wife was employed to nur&s;e the infected people; yet &s;he her&s;elf never was in|fected. The only pre&s;ervative he u&s;ed again&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="013145_0077_0F8EC292694BDA88">
the infection, was holding garlick and rue in his mouth, and &s;moaking tobacco; this I had from his own mouth. His wife's remedy was wa&s;hing her head in vinegar, and &s;prinkling her head-clothes &s;o with vinegar, as to keep them always moi&s;t; and if the &s;mell of any of tho&s;e &s;he waited on was more than ordinary offen&s;ive, &s;he &s;nuffed vinegar up into her no&s;e, &s;prinkled her head-clothes and held a hanker|chief wetted with vinegar to her mouth.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t not omit mentioning the di&s;po&s;ition of the people of that day, with re|&s;pect to their charity to the poor, which indeed was very large both in a publick and a private way. Some pious ladies were &s;o zealous in this good work, and &s;o confident in the protection of providence, in the di&s;charge of this great duty, that they went about them&s;elves di&s;tri|buting alms, and vi&s;iting the poor families that were infected, in their very hou&s;es, appointing nur&s;es and apothecaries to &s;upply them with what they wanted; thus giving their ble&s;&s;ings to the poor in &s;ub&s;tantial relief, as well as hearty prayers for them. I will not undertake to &s;ay, that none of the&s;e charitable people were &s;uffered to die of the plague, but this I may &s;ay, that I never knew any of them mi&s;carried, which I mention for the encouragement of others in ca&s;e of like di&s;tre&s;s; and doubtle&s;s, if they, <HI>that give to the poor, lend to the Lord, and he will repay it,</HI> tho&s;e that hazard their lives to give to the poor, and to comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;uch a mi&s;ery as this, may hope to be pro|tected therein.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="013145_0077_0F8EC292694BDA88">From the middle of Augu&s;t to the middle of September the infection &s;till increa&s;ed and &s;pread it&s;elf, with an irre&s;i&s;tible fury; it was reckoned, that during that time there died no le&s;s than &s;ixteen hundred a day, one day with another. It was then that the confu&s;ion and terror was inexpre&s;&s;ible; the courage of the people appoint|ed to carry away the dead, began to fail them; the vigilance of the magi&s;trates was now put to the utmo&s;t trial. At la&s;t the violence of the di&s;|temper came to &s;uch a height that the people &s;at &s;till looking at one another, and &s;eemed quite abandoned to de&s;pair. In a word, people began to give them&s;elves up to fear, that there was no|thing to be expected but a univer&s;al de&s;olation. This de&s;pair made people bold and venturous, they were no more &s;hy of one another, as ex|pecting there was now no avoiding the di&s;tem|per, but that all mu&s;t go, this brought them to crowd into the churches, they inquired no more what condition the people who &s;at near them were in, but looking upon them&s;elves al&s;o as &s;o many dead corps, they came to the churches without the lea&s;t caution, and crowded together, as if their lives were of no con&s;equence, compa|red to the work which they were come about: Indeed, their zeal in coming, and the earne&s;tne&s;s and affectionate attention they &s;hewed to what they heard, made it manife&s;t what value peo|ple would put upon the wor&s;hip of God, if they thought, every day they attended at the church, would be their la&s;t. It was in the height of this de&s;pair, that it plea&s;ed God to

&s;tay his hand, and to &s;lacken the fury of the contagion, in a manner as &s;urpri&s;ing as that of its beginning, and which demon&s;trated it to be his own particular hand above the agen|cy of means; nothing but omnipotent power could have done it; the contagion, de&s;pi&s;ed all medicine; death raged in every corner, and had it gone on as it did then, a few weeks more would have cleared the town of all its inhabi|tants. In that very moment when thirty thou|&s;and were dead in three weeks, nay, when it was reported three thou&s;and died in one night, and an hundred thou&s;and more were taken &s;ick, when we might well &s;ay, <HI>Vain was the help of man,</HI> it plea&s;ed God to cau&s;e the fury of it to abate, and by his immediate hand to di&s;arm the enemy. It was wonderful! The phy&s;icians were &s;urpri&s;ed, wherever they vi&s;ited, to find their patients better, and in a few days every body was recovering: Nor was this by any medicine found out, or any new method of cure di&s;covered, but it was evidently from the &s;ecret invi&s;ible hand of him that had at fir&s;t &s;ent this di&s;ea&s;e, as a judgment upon us. Let the philo&s;ophers &s;earch for rea&s;ons in nature to account for it, and labour as much as they will to le&s;&s;en the debt they owe to their maker; tho&s;e phy&s;icians who had the lea&s;t &s;hare of re|ligion in them, were obliged to acknowledge, that it was all &s;upernatural. The &s;treets were now full of poor recovering creatures, who appeared very &s;en&s;ible and thankful to God for their unexpected deliverance: Yet I mu&s;t own,

that as for the generality of the people, it might too ju&s;tly be &s;aid of them, as was &s;aid of the children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> after they had been de|livered from the ho&s;t of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> that <HI>they &s;ung his prai&s;e, but they &s;oon forgot his works.</HI></P>
<P>The author, who was pre&s;erved unhurt with his whole family, during the time of the &s;ick|ne&s;s, gives in his memoirs a particular account of the many rea&s;onings and fears which affect|ed his mind, before he could come to a fixed conclu&s;ion, whether to &s;tay, and take his lot in the &s;tation in which God had placed him, or by leaving the city, run the hazard of un|&s;ettling him&s;elf, and lo&s;e his effects which lay &s;cattered among the merchants. At the earne&s;t &s;olicitations of his brother he had concluded to go; but being always cro&s;&s;ed in this de&s;ign by &s;everal accidents, it came one morning, as he expre&s;&s;es it, very warmly in his mind, whether the&s;e repeated di&s;appointments were not intimations to him, that it was the will of heaven he &s;hould not go, which was &s;ucceed|ed by a further thought, that if this &s;ugge&s;tion was from God, he was able effectually to pre|&s;erve him in the mid&s;t of all deaths and dangers that would &s;urround him, and that if he at|tempted to &s;ecure him&s;elf, by fleeing from his habitation, and acted contrary to the&s;e intima|ons, which he believed to be divine, it was a kind of flying from God, who could cau&s;e his ju&s;tice to overtake him, when and where he thought fit.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="013145_0079_0F8EC293E070CF40">But what finally &s;ixed him in a re&s;olution to &s;tay, and ca&s;t him&s;elf entirely upon the pro|tection and good plea&s;ure of the Almighty, was, that at a time, when his thoughts were more than commonly &s;erious upon this weighty &s;ubject, turning over the bible which lay be|fore him, he cried out, <HI>Well, I know not what to do, Lord direct me!</HI> at that juncture happening to &s;top and ca&s;ting his eye on the &s;econd ver&s;e of the 91&s;t P&s;alm, he read to the 10th, as follows, viz. <HI>I will &s;ay of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortre&s;s, my God, in him will I tru&s;t.

<P>OBSERVING &s;ome years ago the dreadful havock made by the ex|ce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of di&s;tilled &s;pirituous liquors in this part of the world, I was induced to in&s;ert in one of the almanacks an ex|tract of what had been written on that &s;ubject by Dr. Hales, fellow of the Royal Society, containing his own remarks, with the &s;entiments of &s;everal per&s;ons of note in the phy&s;ical way; who&s;e knowledge of the nature of di&s;tilled liquors, as well as of their effects on the human frame, be&s;t qualified them to give a right judgment thereon. And as the exce&s;&s;ive and indeed mi&s;taken u&s;e of the&s;e liquors continues, and rather increa&s;es, on this Continent, 'tis thought a republication of tho&s;e &s;enti|ments,

with &s;ome additions, may, thro' divine ble&s;&s;ing, be beneficial to many; particularly to &s;ome well-minded people, who are under mi&s;taken prejudices on this mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubject. "My principal and indeed only motive," &s;ays this bene|volent author, <Q>is to endeavour to rou&s;e the caution and indignation of man|kind, again&s;t tho&s;e mighty de&s;troy|ers and deba&s;ers of the human &s;pecies, <HI>fermented di&s;tilled &s;pirituous liquors;</HI> tho&s;e wor&s;e than infernal &s;pirits, which bewitch and infatuate the nations with their &s;or|ceries.</Q>&mdash;An evil &s;o amazingly great, that did not woeful experience too fully prove it, it &s;eems incredible, that any whom it concerns could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o neg|ligent, as not to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endea|vours to &s;uppre&s;s this de&s;tructive <HI>man|bane.</HI></P>
<P>That eminent phy&s;ician Dr. Hoffman expre&s;ly cautions again&s;t the u&s;e of di&s;til|led &s;pirituous liquors. "Becau&s;e," &s;ays he, <Q>they are, above all things, mo&s;t un|whole&s;ome, being cau&s;tic burning &s;pi|rits; which, by inflaming the &s;olids, and thickening the fluids, cau&s;e ob&s;tructi|ons, which bring on many fatal di&s;|ea&s;es, &s;uch as hectick fevers, jaundices, drop&s;ies, &amp;c. whereby multitudes are yearly and daily de&s;troyed.</Q> He al&s;o

ob&s;erves, <Q>that they rot the entrails, &s;uch as the liver, &s;tomach and bowels; as it is evident, not only by opening the bodies of tho&s;e who are killed by drink|ing them, but al&s;o by what is ob&s;erved in Germany of the effect which the cau&s;tic, fiery, remaining wa&s;h of the di|&s;tillers, has on the guts of hogs; which are thereby &s;o tendered, that they can|not make puddings with them.</Q>&mdash;He farther ob&s;erves, <Q>That the fle&s;h of &s;uch hogs will not keep, even when &s;alted, &s;o well as the fle&s;h of other hogs.</Q> Dr. Cheyne, in his e&s;&s;ay of health and long life, &s;ays, <Q>All people, who have any re|gard to their health and lives, ought to tremble at the fir&s;t cravings for &s;uch poi&s;onous liquors. The maladies begot by them, bring forth nece&s;&s;ity upon ne|ce&s;&s;ity of drams and gills; till, at la&s;t, a kind drop&s;y, nervous convul&s;ion, flux, if not a fever, or phrenzy, &s;ets the poor &s;oul free. It has often rai&s;ed in me the mo&s;t melancholly reflections, to &s;ee the virtuous and &s;en&s;ible, bound in &s;uch chains and fetters, as nothing le&s;s than omnipotent grace or the unrelenting grave could relea&s;e them from.</Q></P>

&s;pirits, the more I am confirmed, that the human race had been happier had drams never been known: and I can|not help cordially joining with Doctor Allen, in his Synop&s;is Medici, A. 1633. <HI>That the plentiful devouring of tho&s;e &s;pirits has killed as many thou&s;ands of men, as there are &s;tars in the &s;ky. Nay, ten times ten thou&s;ands have died by the&s;e, more than all the re&s;t of the poi&s;ons what|ever.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Doctor Lind, in his treati&s;e on the &s;cur|vy, &s;ays, <Q>He ob&s;erved mo&s;t de&s;tructive di&s;tempers to be much increa&s;ed, even to mortality, by di&s;tilled &s;pirituous li|quors; which &s;ailors are too apt gree|dily to &s;wallow down.</Q> And Doctor Hales ob&s;erves, from the remarks made to him by an eminent &s;urgeon, <Q>That the &s;tomachs of great dram-drinkers were contracted into half the common natural &s;ize, and hard; &s;omewhat like leather, that had been held to the fire. The con&s;equence of which was, lo&s;s of appetite, and a wa&s;ting con&s;umption.</Q></P>
<P>It is pretended, that drams comfort, warm, and defend from the &s;everity of weather, to which men are &s;ometimes ex|po&s;ed; without which, they &s;ay, they &s;hould peri&s;h with cold; which is proba|bly, in a great mea&s;ure, true of tho&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="013145_0083_0F8EC29A840501C8">
who are habituated to drink them; the blood of &s;uch being thereby &s;o much im|poveri&s;hed, that it is well known many of the drinkers of drams are cold and lifele&s;s in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, without frequent repetitions: this is what &s;ome of them have owned. But on the other hand, how much more able are &s;ober per|&s;ons to endure cold and hard&s;hips? their vital heat not being extingui&s;hed by in|temperance, does, by its kindly genial warmth, more effectually &s;ecure them from the inclemency of the weather, than the fal&s;e fla&s;h of a dram. Be&s;ides, it is well known, that men did not peri&s;h in the colde&s;t countries for want of drams formerly, when they were not to be had. Of the undoubted truth of this, Captain Ellis gives a full proof in the account of his voyage to Hud&s;on's Bay, page 199. Where he ob&s;erves, <Q>That the natives on the very cold coa&s;t, of that Bay, to whom the French are kinder than to &s;ell di&s;tilled &s;pirituous liquors, are tall, hardy, robu&s;t and active; whereas tho&s;e of them that are &s;upplied with drams from the Engli&s;h, are a meagre, dwarf|i&s;h, indolent people, hardly equal to the &s;everity of the country, and &s;ubject to many di&s;orders.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="013145_0084_0F8EBA88D0BBA548">And as to the pernicious effects of &s;pi|rituous liquors in very hot climates, (as on the coa&s;t of Guinea) it is ob&s;erved, that the French and Portugue&s;e, who do not indulge in di&s;tilled &s;pirits, are healthy compared with the Engli&s;h; who, drink|ing freely of &s;pirits, &amp;c. die fa&s;t. Thus, al&s;o, it is ob&s;erved of the women in the We&s;t-Indies, that being &s;ober, they live long; but it is often otherwi&s;e with the men, who are more generally intempe|rate.</P>
<P>The unhappy dram-drinkers are &s;o ab|&s;olutely bound in &s;lavery to the&s;e infernal &s;pirits, that they &s;eem to have lo&s;t the power of delivering them&s;elves from this wor&s;t of bondage. How much then is it the bounden duty of tho&s;e, who have it in their power, to with-hold this de&s;truc|tive <HI>man-bane,</HI> either as parents, ma&s;ters, or rulers to the people committed to their tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Since then the evil is become &s;o noto|riou&s;ly epidemical as to debilitate and de|&s;troy multitudes, in mo&s;t parts of the world; it behoves all, who have any bow|els of pity for their fellow-creatures, more e&s;pecially the governors of the nations, as guardians and tender fathers, to guard the people committed to their charge from this <HI>mighty de&s;troyer.</HI> Can there be any
<PB N="9" REF="013145_0084_0F8EBA88D0BBA548">
con&s;ideration, of &s;ufficient weight, to the contrary. Is it &s;ound policy to encourage vice in the people, becau&s;e a pre&s;ent re|venue ari&s;es from their debaucheries? Where will the revenue be, when the people, who &s;hould pay them, are de|&s;troyed? Are not a hardy, indu&s;trious healthy people, always found to be the mo&s;t able to contribute amply to the &s;up|port of government? And will not tem|perance, in the end, be found a more ef|fectual means to increa&s;e the real wealth and &s;trength of a nation, than to make drunkenne&s;s the cheape&s;t of vices?

<P>Though thou&s;ands and tens of thou|&s;ands peri&s;h every year by di&s;tilled &s;pi|rituous liquors, yet few appear to lay it effectually to heart. I mu&s;t here except the heads of the poor wild Indians, of the Six Nations &s;ituate back of New-York, and other parts of North-America, who being &s;en&s;ible of the great de&s;truction made a|mong&s;t them by di&s;tilled &s;pirituous li|quors, have long &s;ince, and do &s;till conti|nue, earne&s;tly to de&s;ire, that no &s;uch &s;pirit &s;hould be &s;old to their people. At a treaty held at Carli&s;le in this province, with the deputies of the Six Nations, the Dela|wares and other we&s;tern Indians, in the year 1753, Scarrooyady, one of the chiefs of the Six Nations, &s;peaking on behalf of all the Indians pre&s;ent, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the following effect, viz. <Q>The rum ruins us: we beg you would prevent its coming in &s;uch quantities, by regu|lating the traders.

When the&s;e whi&s;key tra|ders come, they bring thirty or forty cags, puts them down before us, and make us drink, and get all the &s;kins that &s;hould go to pay the debts we have contracted, for goods bought of the fair trader; and by the&s;e means, we not only ruin our&s;elves, but them too. The&s;e wicked whi&s;key &s;ellers, when they have once got the Indians in liquor, make them &s;ell their very clothes from their backs.

<P>The mi&s;taken u&s;e and grievous abu&s;e of rum and other di&s;tilled &s;pirits, perhaps in no ca&s;e appear more palpably than at the time of harve&s;t, a bu&s;ine&s;s which, under the Mo&s;aic Di&s;pen&s;ation, was par|ticularly enjoined to be carried on with humiliation and thank&s;giving, and ought by all means, to be ob&s;erved as &s;uch under the go&s;pel; but through the abu&s;e of &s;pi|rituous liquors, is made an occa&s;ion of a greater abu&s;e of the creature and di&s;honour of the Creator; this ari&s;es, in many, from a mi&s;taken per&s;ua&s;ion that hard labour, particularly that of the harve&s;t field, can|not be carried on without a quantity of rum or other di&s;tilled &s;pirits; and in &s;up|port of this opinion, we are frequently told of the many people who have died in the field through extream heat and fa|tigue, and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that many more would die, if a plentiful u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors was not allowed. But this I am per&s;uaded is a great mi&s;take, it being much more likely that the free u&s;e of rum occa|&s;ioned the death of tho&s;e people; the
<PB N="19" REF="013145_0089_0F8EC29DE1E11C68">

If &s;uch labour was carried on with &s;teadine&s;s and proper moderation, there would certainly be no need of a re|cruit of &s;trength being &s;ought for by that means; more frequent intervals of re&s;t, with a little food, oftener allowed the reapers, and &s;mall drinks; &s;uch as mola&s;|&s;es and water made agreeable with a little

<P>I have heard of &s;everal thoughtful peo|ple who, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that the com|mon method of giving &s;pirituous liquors to labourers was exceeding hurtful, have made it a condition with tho&s;e they have employed, not to u&s;e any &s;pirituous liquors in their fields; the&s;e have had their work performed to good &s;atisfaction, and with|out any damage en&s;uing to their labour|ers.

A particular in&s;tance of this kind occurred la&s;t &s;ummer, in the ca&s;e of Jo&s;hua Evans, of Haddonfield; this con&s;iderate per&s;on being convinced that the u&s;e of rum and other &s;pirituous liquors, was extreamly hurtful to the la|bouring people; more e&s;pecially during
<PB N="23" REF="013145_0091_0F8EC1FBA37DA9B0">
the time of harve&s;t, apprehended it to be his duty, to become an example in oppo|&s;ition to this pernicious cu&s;tom; and he concluded to run all ri&s;ques of lo&s;s and da|mage, which might happen to him&s;elf by the delay of bringing in his harve&s;t, ra|ther than comply with a cu&s;tom which he apprehended to be &s;o de&s;tructive of his fellow <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P>He therefore offered &s;ix-pence per day more than other farmers, to &s;uch labour|ers as were willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing in his harve&s;t, on condition that no &s;piritu|ous liquors &s;hould be u&s;ed in his fields.

and his corn was cut down and brought in as well, if not better, than ever it had been before; and tho' the people drank little but water or milk and water, chu&s;ing it rather than cyder and water, or &s;mall beer, which they were not u&s;ed to; they went thro' their bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;atisfaction to him and them&s;elves.

<P>This is a plain in&s;tance in contradiction to the common prejudice, that labouring people cannot with &s;afety perform their work without u&s;ing tho&s;e liquors. Seve|ral more examples might be in&s;tanced of &s;ome con&s;iderate people who have made it a rule not to make any u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, either among&s;t their workmen in the pro&s;ecution of their trades, or on their plantations.

<P><PB N="43" REF="013145_0101_0F8EC20CF67BF7B0">Upon the whole it may be a&s;ked, What can be done towards preventing or put|ting a check to the prodigious havock made by the pre&s;ent u&s;e of &s;pirituous li|quors? To this I &s;hall reply with the re|&s;pectable author fir&s;t mentioned. Let &s;uch lawmakers, governors, and rulers, who retain any love and pity for their fellow men; let <HI>the&s;e</HI> be earne&s;tly reque&s;ted &s;eri|ou&s;ly, and &s;olemnly to con&s;ider, whether it is not <HI>their</HI> indi&s;pen&s;able duty to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours, that a &s;top may be put to this dreadful calamity; let not the apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;s or any pre&s;ent incon|veniency, deter any from doing their duty in this re&s;pect, becau&s;e there cannot any inconveniencies po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from the re|dre&s;s of this grievance, which de&s;erves to be named with tho&s;e evils which will be the undoubted con&s;equence of its conti|nuance.

What multitudes of lives would thereby be &s;aved, and what innumerable outrages, as theft, murder, &amp;c. prevented: To rectify which, were an apparently vain and fruitle&s;s attempt, while drunkenne&s;s is made the cheape&s;t of all vices.

the utmo&s;t of his power, di&s;courage the encrea&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors either by im|portation, di&s;tillation, or otherwi&s;e, and not deceive them&s;elves, or rather &s;uffer the God of this world to deceive them by means of the &s;pecious pretences common|ly advanced; &s;uch as, That other people will be active in augmenting the quantity if they do not; or, That however people may abu&s;e them&s;elves thro' exce&s;s, yet what is deemed a moderate quantity, may lawfully be u&s;ed; but it may ea&s;ily be &s;hewn, that the&s;e and other arguments commonly advanced, are vain, tho' plau|&s;ible pretences; that the true motive is the de&s;ire of gain: That every new importer and di&s;tiller, (and oh that the vender al&s;o may bring his &s;ituation to the true ba|lance) becomes a party to the evil; gives fre&s;h &s;trength to the practice, by holding out an additional quantity, and of cour&s;e making it in &s;ome degree cheaper, at lea&s;t ea&s;ier for their fellow men to come at, to the de&s;truction of their brethren, children of the &s;ame father, and who as chri&s;tians they profe&s;s to love as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And as for &s;uch who, tho' convinced of the impropriety of the practice, yet for fear of not having their labour performed, or for other rea&s;ons, cannot prevail upon them&s;elves to refrain giving it to their &s;er|vants and labourers, let the&s;e at lea&s;t &s;o

<P>A very eminent phy&s;ician has given the following direction for the benefit of tho&s;e who have not wi&s;dom enough left at once to abandon the odious and pernicious practice of drinking di&s;tilled &s;pirituous li|quors, <HI>viz.</HI> By degrees to mix water with the &s;pirit; to le&s;&s;en the quantity every day, and keep to the &s;ame quantity of water, till in about the cour&s;e of a week, nothing of the dram kind be u&s;ed along with the water. By this means the per&s;on will &s;uf|fer no inconveniency, but reap great be|nefit upon leaving off drams or &s;pirits, as has been tried by many. If any gnawing be left in the &s;tomach upon quite leaving it off, a little warm broth, weak tea, or any thing of that kind, will be of &s;ervice. The appetite always increa&s;es in a few days after leaving off drams, unle&s;s by the too long continuance of them, the tone of the &s;tomach is de&s;troyed. And when the &s;to|mach is thus affected, a cup of carduus, camomile tea, wormwood or centaury every morning fa&s;ting and every evening, will be found a good remedy.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="013145_0103_0F8EC20E94403C10">Some GENERAL MAXIMS, mo&s;tly drawn from the foregoing, which as they cannot be too obvi|ou&s;ly held up in the view of the young and incon&s;i|derate, its hoped the ob&s;ervant reader will excu&s;e the repetition.</P>
<P>THE great rule of diet is to &s;tudy &s;implicity: Nature delights in the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple food; and every animal, except man, follows her dictates.</P>
<P>Nothing conduces more to health and long life, than ab&s;tinence and plain food, with due labour.</P>
<P>Water alone is &s;ufficient and effectual for all the purpo&s;es of human want in drink: It is the univer|&s;al di&s;&s;olvent nature has provided, and the mo&s;t cer|tain diluter of all bodies proper for food; quickens the appetite and &s;trengthens dige&s;tion mo&s;t. Doctor Cheyne and doctor Cadogan.</P>
<P>Strong and &s;pirituous liquors were never de&s;igned for common u&s;e: They were formerly kept in Eng|land, as other medicines are, in apothecaries &s;hops: If freely indulged, they become a certain tho' &s;low poi&s;on. Cheyne.</P>
<P>All intoxicating liquors may be con&s;idered as poi|&s;ons; however di&s;gui&s;ed, that is their real charac|ter, and &s;ooner or later they will have their effect. Doctor Buchan.</P>
<P>Every act of intoxication puts nature to the expence of a fever, in order to di&s;charge the poi&s;onous draught; when this is repeated almo&s;t every day, it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Fevers occa&s;ioned by drinking, do not always go off in a day, they frequently end in an inflammation of the brea&s;t, liver, or brain, and produce fatal effects.</P>
<P>There is no danger in leaving off drinking &s;trong liquors at once, the plea for continuing them being fal&s;e and groundle&s;s. Cheyne.</P>
<P>Strong liquors do not prevent the mi&s;chiefs of a
<PB N="48" REF="013145_0104_0F8EC20F3ADE09B0">
&s;urfeit, nor carry it off &s;o &s;efely as water, tho' they &s;eem to give pre&s;ent relief. Cheyne.</P>
<P>Many imagine that hard labour could not be &s;up|ported without drinking &s;trong liquors. This tho' a common, is a very erroneous opinion: Men who ne|ver ta&s;ted &s;trong liquors, are not only able to endure more fatigue, but al&s;o live much longer than tho&s;e who u&s;e them daily. Buchan.</P>
<P>Every thing that has pa&s;t the fire, &s;o that it has had due time to divide and penetrate its parts, as in di&s;tillation, as far as it po&s;&s;ibly can, retains a cau&s;tic corro&s;ive and burning quality ever afterwards.</P>
<P>In the continued di&s;tillation of &s;pirits, the action of fire is &s;o &s;trong as to reduce them to liquid fire at la&s;t; which will of them&s;elves evaporate in vi&s;ible flames and fumes, Cheyne.</P>
<P>The great quantity of vi&s;cid malt liquor drank by the common people of England, cannot fail to ren|der the blood &s;izy and unfit for circulation, from whence proceed ob&s;tructions and inflammations of the lungs, &amp;c. Buchan.</P>
<P>Malt liquors (excepting clear &s;mall beer of due age) are extreamly hurtful to tender and &s;tudious per&s;ons. Cheyne.</P>
<P>There are few great ale drinkers who are not phthi&s;ical, nor is that to be wondered at, con&s;idering the glutinous and almo&s;t indige&s;tible nature of &s;trong ale. Buchan.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who drink ardent &s;pirits or &s;trong wines do not run le&s;s hazard; the&s;e liquors heat and inflame the blood, and tear the tender ve&s;&s;els of the lungs in pieces. Buchan.</P>
<P>Doctor Cadogan in his late treati&s;e on the gout, &s;ays, He cannot allow him to be &s;trictly temperate, who drinks any wine or &s;trong liquors at all, unle&s;s it be medicinally.</P>

<HEAD>THOUGHTS UPON SLAVERY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. BY <HI>&s;lavery</HI> I mean dome&s;tic &s;lavery, or that of a &s;ervant to a ma&s;ter. A late ingenious writer well ob&s;erves, "The variety of forms in which &s;lavery appears, makes it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to convey a ju&s;t notion of it, by way of de|finition. There are however certain pro|perties which have accompanied &s;lavery in mo&s;t places, whereby it is ea&s;ily di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from that mild dome&s;tic <HI>&s;ervice</HI> which obtains in our own country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Hargrave's</HI> plea for <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> the negro.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Slavery</HI> imports an obligation of per|petual &s;ervice, an obligation which only
<PB N="4" REF="013145_0106_0F8EC210B05561F0">
the con&s;ent of the ma&s;ter can di&s;&s;olve. Neither in &s;ome countries can the ma&s;ter him&s;elf di&s;&s;olve it, without the con&s;ent of judges appointed by law. It generally gives the ma&s;ter an arbitrary power of any correction not affecting life or limb.&mdash; Sometimes even the&s;e are expo&s;ed to his will: or protected only by a &s;ine, or &s;ome &s;light puni&s;hment, too in&s;iconderable to re&s;train a ma&s;ter of an har&s;h temper. It creates an incapacity of acquiring any thing, except for the ma&s;ter's benefit. It allows the ma&s;ter to alienate the &s;lave, in the &s;ame manner as his cows and hor&s;es. La&s;tly, it de&s;cends in its full extent from parent to child, even to the late&s;t gene|ration.</P>
<P N="3">3. The beginning of this may be dated from the remote&s;t period, of which we have an account in hi&s;tory. It commenced in the barbarous &s;tate of &s;ociety, and in proce&s;s of time &s;pread into all nations. It prevailed particularly among the <HI>Jews,</HI> the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the <HI>Romans,</HI> and the antient <HI>Germans:</HI> And was tran&s;mitted by them to the various kingdoms and &s;tates, which aro&s;e out of the ruins of the <HI>Roman</HI> em|pire. But after chri&s;tianity prevailed, it gradually fell into decline in almo&s;t all parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> This great change began in <HI>Spain,</HI> about the end of the eighth cen|tury:
<PB N="5" REF="013145_0106_0F8EC210B05561F0">
And was become general in mo&s;t other kingdoms of <HI>Europe,</HI> before the mid|dle of the fourteenth.</P>
<P N="4">4. From this time &s;lavery was nearly extinct, till the commencement of the &s;ix|teenth century, when the di&s;covery of <HI>America,</HI> and of the we&s;tern and ea&s;tern coa&s;ts of <HI>Africa,</HI> gave occa&s;ion to the revi|val of it. It took its ri&s;e from the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> who to &s;upply the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with men, to cultivate their new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in <HI>America,</HI> procured negroes from <HI>Africa,</HI> whom they &s;old for &s;laves to the <HI>American</HI> Spaniards. This began in the year 1508, when they imported the fir&s;t negroes into <HI>Hi&s;paniola.</HI> In 1540 <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, then king of <HI>Spain,</HI> determined to put an end to <HI>negro-&s;lavery:</HI> Giving po&s;itive orders, That all the negro &s;laves in the Spani&s;h dominions &s;hould be &s;et free. And this was accordingly done by <HI>Laga&s;ca,</HI> whom he &s;ent and impowered to free them all, on condition of continuing to labour for their ma&s;ters. But &s;oon after <HI>Laga&s;ca</HI> re|turned to <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;lavery returned and flou|ri&s;hed as before. Afterwards other na|tions, as they acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in <HI>America,</HI> followed the examples of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and &s;lavery has now taken deep root in mo&s;t of our <HI>American</HI> colonies.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="013145_0107_0F8EC21160BEEF40">II. Such is the nature of &s;lavery: Such the beginning of negro-&s;lavery in <HI>America.</HI> But &s;ome may de&s;ire to know, what kind of country it is, from which the negroes are brought? What &s;ort of men, of what temper and behaviour are they in their own country? And in what manner they are generally procured, carried to, and treated in <HI>America?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. And fir&s;t, What kind of country is that from whence they are brought? Is it &s;o remarkably horrid, dreary and barren, that it is a kindne&s;s to deliver them out of it? I believe many have apprehended &s;o: But it is an entire mi&s;take, if we may give credit to tho&s;e who have lived many years therein, and could have no motive to mi&s;repre&s;ent it.</P>
<P N="2">2. That part of <HI>Africa</HI> whence the ne|groes are brought, commonly known by the name of <HI>Guinea,</HI> extends along the coa&s;t, in the whole, between three and four thou&s;and miles. From the river <HI>Se|negal,</HI> (&s;eventeen degrees north of the line) to Cape <HI>Sierra Leona,</HI> it contains &s;even hundred miles. Thence it runs ea&s;tward about fifteen hundred miles, including the <HI>Grain-Coa&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Ivory-Coa&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Gold-Coa&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Slave-Coa&s;t,</HI> with the large king|dom of <HI>Benin.</HI> From thence it runs &s;outh|ward, about twelve hundred miles, and
<PB N="7" REF="013145_0107_0F8EC21160BEEF40">
contains the kingdoms of <HI>Congo</HI> and <HI>An|gola.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Concerning the fir&s;t, the <HI>Senegal-Coa&s;t,</HI> Mon&s;. <HI>Brue,</HI> who lived there &s;ixteen years, after de&s;cribing its fruitfulne&s;s near the &s;ea, &s;ays, "The farther you go from the &s;ea, the more fruitful and well-im|proved is the country, abounding in pul&s;e, Indian corn, and various fruits. Here are va&s;t meadows, which feed large herds of great and &s;mall cattle. And the villages which lie thick, &s;hew the country is well peopled." And again: "I was &s;urprized, to &s;ee the land &s;o well cultivated; &s;carce a &s;pot lay un-improved: The low lands divided by &s;mall canals, were all &s;owed with rice: The higher grounds were plant|ed with Indian corn, and peas of different &s;orts. Their beef is excellent; poultry plenty and very cheap, as are all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life."</P>
<P N="4">4. As to the <HI>Grain</HI> and <HI>Ivory Coa&s;t,</HI> we learn from eye witne&s;&s;es, that the &s;oil is in general fertile, producing abundance of rice and roots. Indigo and cotton thrive without cultivation.&mdash;Fi&s;h is in great plenty; the flocks and herds are numerous, and the trees loaded with fruit.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Gold-Coa&s;t</HI> and <HI>Slave-Coa&s;t,</HI> all who have &s;een it agree, is exceeding fruit|ful and plea&s;ant, producing va&s;t quantities
<PB N="8" REF="013145_0108_0F8EC21632E42320">
of rice and other grain, plenty of fruit and roots, palm-wine, and oil, and fi&s;h in great abundance, with much tame and wild cattle. The very &s;ame account is given us of the &s;oil and produce of the kingdoms of <HI>Benin, Congo</HI> and <HI>Angola.</HI>&mdash; From all which it appears, That <HI>Guinea</HI> in general, far from being an horrid, dreary, barren country, is one of the mo&s;t fruitful, as well as the mo&s;t plea&s;ant countries in the known world. It is &s;aid indeed to be unhealthy. And &s;o it is to &s;trangers, but perfectly healthy to the native inhabi|tants.</P>
<P N="6">6. Such is the country from which the negroes are brought. We come next to enquire, What &s;ort of men they are, of what temper and behaviour, not in our plantations, but in their native country. And here likewi&s;e the &s;ure&s;t way is to take our account from eye and ear witne&s;&s;es. Now tho&s;e who have lived in the <HI>Senegal</HI> country ob&s;erve, it is inhabited by three nations, the <HI>Jalofs, Fulis,</HI> and <HI>Mandingos.</HI> The king of the <HI>Jalofs</HI> has under him &s;e|veral mini&s;ters, who a&s;&s;i&s;t in the exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice. The chief ju&s;tice goes in cir|cuit through all his dominions, to hear complaints and determine controver&s;ies. And the viceroy goes with him, to in&s;pect the behaviour of the <HI>Alkadi,</HI> or Governor
<PB N="9" REF="013145_0108_0F8EC21632E42320">
of each village. The <HI>Fulis</HI> are a numerous people; the &s;oil of their country repre&s;ent|ed as rich, affording large harve&s;ts, and the people laborious and good farmers: Of &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Fuli</HI> blacks who dwelt on the river <HI>Gambia, William Moor</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> factor gives a very favourable account.&mdash; He &s;ays, they are governed by their chief men, who rule with much moderation. Few of them will drink any thing &s;tronger than water, being &s;trict <HI>Mahometans.</HI> The government is ea&s;y, becau&s;e the people are of a good and quiet di&s;po&s;ition; and &s;o well in&s;tructed in what is right, that a man who wrongs another is the abomina|tion of all.&mdash;They de&s;ire no more land than they u&s;e, which they cultivate with great care and indu&s;try: If any of them are known to be made &s;laves by the white men they all join to redeem them. They not only &s;upport all that are old, or blind, or lame among them&s;elves; but have frequently &s;upplied the nece&s;&s;ities of the <HI>Mandingos,</HI> when they were di&s;tre&s;t by famine.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>Mandingos,</HI> &s;ays Mon&s;. <HI>Brue,</HI> are rigid <HI>Mahometans,</HI> drinking neither wine nor brandy. They are indu&s;trious and laborious, keeping their ground well cul|tivated, and breeding a good &s;tock of cat|tle. Every town has a governor, and he
<PB N="10" REF="013145_0109_0F8EC2174DB523D8">
appoints the labour of the people. The men work the ground de&s;igned for corn; the women and girls, the rice-ground.&mdash; He afterwards divides the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> rice among them: And decides all quarrels if any ari&s;e. All the Mahometan negroes con&s;tantly go to public prayers thrice a day: there being a prie&s;t in every village, who regularly calls them together: Some authors &s;ay, it is &s;urprizing to &s;ee the atten|tion and reverence which they ob&s;erve during their wor&s;hip.&mdash;The&s;e three nati|ons practi&s;e &s;everal trades; they have &s;miths, &s;adlers, potters and weavers. And they are very ingenious at their &s;everal occupations.&mdash;Their &s;miths not only make all the in&s;truments of iron, which they have occa&s;ion to u&s;e, but likewi&s;e work many things neatly in gold and &s;ilver. It is chiefly the women and chil|dren who weave fine cotton cloth, which they dye blue and black.</P>
<P N="8">8. It was of the&s;e parts of <HI>Guinea,</HI> that Mon&s;. <HI>Adan&s;on,</HI> corre&s;pondent of the royal academy of &s;ciences at <HI>Paris</HI> from 1749 to 1753, gives the following account, both as to the country and people. "Which way &s;oever I turned my eyes, I beheld a per|fect image of pure nature: An agreeable &s;olitude, bounded on every &s;ide by a charming land&s;cape; the rural &s;ituation
<PB N="11" REF="013145_0109_0F8EC2174DB523D8">
of cottages, in the mid&s;t of trees; the ea&s;e and quietne&s;s of the negroes, reclined un|der the &s;hade of the &s;preading foliage, with the &s;implicity of their dre&s;s and man|ners: The whole revived in my mind the idea of our fir&s;t parents, and I &s;eemed to contemplate the world in its primitive &s;tate. They are generally-&s;peaking, very good-natured, &s;ociable and obliging. I was not a little plea&s;ed with my very fir&s;t reception, and it fully convinced me, that there ought to be a con&s;iderable abate|ment made, in the accounts we have of the &s;avage character of the <HI>Africans.</HI>" He adds, "It is amazing that an illiterate people &s;hould rea&s;on &s;o pertinently con|cerning the heavenly bodies. There is no doubt, but that with proper in&s;tru|ments, they would become excellent a&s;tro|nomers."</P>
<P N="9">9. The inhabitants of the <HI>Grain</HI> and <HI>Ivory-Coa&s;t</HI> are repre&s;ented by tho&s;e that deal with them, as &s;en&s;ible, courteous, and the faire&s;t traders on the coa&s;ts of <HI>Guinea.</HI> They rarely drink to exce&s;s: If any do, they are &s;everely puni&s;hed by the king's order. They are &s;eldom troubled with war: If a difference happen between two nations, they commony end the di&s;|pute amicably.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Slave-Coa&s;t</HI> likewi&s;e, when they are not artfully
<PB N="12" REF="013145_0110_0F8EC2178B277030">
incen&s;ed again&s;t each other, live in great union and friend&s;hip, being generally well-tempered, civil, tractable, and ready to help any that need it. In particular, the natives of the kingdom of <HI>Whidah</HI> are civil, kind, and obliging to &s;trangers.&mdash;And they are the mo&s;t gentleman-like of all the negroes, abounding in good man|ners towards each other. The inferiors pay great re&s;pect to their &s;uperiors:&mdash; So wives to their hu&s;bands, children to their parents. And they are remarkably indu&s;trious: All are con&s;tantly employ'd; the men in agriculture, the women in &s;pinning and weaving cotton.</P>

The negroes, he &s;ays, are &s;o loath to leave their own country, that they have often leaped out of the canoe, boat and &s;hip, into the &s;eas, and kept under water till they were drowned, to avoid being taken up, and &s;aved by the boats which pur&s;ue them."&mdash;They had about twelve negroes who willingly drowned them&s;elves; others &s;tarved them&s;elves to death&mdash; <HI>Philips</HI> was advi&s;ed to cut off the legs and arms of &s;ome to terrify the re&s;t; (as other captains had done) but this he refu&s;ed to do: From the time of his taking the negroes on board, to his arrival at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> no le&s;s than three hundred and twenty died of various di&s;ea&s;es: Which the author &s;ays.

After confirming what is before &s;aid&punc; he adds, "They &s;tarve them to death, with a loaf hanging over their mouths.

The &s;ame author gives us extracts of &s;ome of the laws of <HI>Jamaica</HI> relating to the puni&s;hment of &s;laves, taken as he &s;ays, from a general collection of the plantation laws, the printed &s;tatutes, or the &s;ecre|tary's-office, viz.</P>
<P>"If any &s;lave by puni&s;hment from his owner for running away, or other offence, &s;uffer in life or limb, none &s;hall be liable to the law for the &s;ame; but who&s;oever &s;hall kill a &s;lave out of wilfulne&s;s, wan|tonne&s;s, or bloody mindedne&s;s, &s;hall &s;uffer three months impri&s;onment, and pay fifty pounds to the owner of the &s;lave. If the party &s;o offending be a &s;ervant, he or &s;he &s;hall have on the bare back thirty-nine la&s;hes, and al&s;o (after the expiration of the term with his or her ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s) &s;hall &s;erve the owner of the decea&s;ed &s;lave the full term of four years. If any per&s;on kill a &s;lave &s;tealing or running away, or found by night out of his owner's ground, road, or common path, &s;uch per&s;on &s;hall not be &s;ubject to any damage or action for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e that go out in parties to reduce the negroes, &s;hall receive from the trea&s;urer for every rebellious negro that &s;hall be killed, bringing in his head to any ju&s;tice, forty pounds; for every negro taken and brought in alive, and not maimed, ten pounds, to be paid by the owner, who is hereby obliged under the penalty of fifty pounds, to tran&s;|port &s;uch &s;lave &s;o taken; and in ca&s;e the owner cannot be found, then the trea&s;urer &s;hall pay the ten pounds, receive the &s;lave, &s;ell and tran&s;port him, and retain the produce to be employed in the &s;aid &s;ervice."</P>
<P>The following adverti&s;ement was taken from one of the <HI>North-Carolina</HI> news papers. "Run-away la&s;t <HI>November,</HI> from the &s;ub&s;criber, a negro fellow named <HI>Zeb,</HI> about 36 years of age, about 5 feet 8 inches high, a very good cooper by trade &amp;c.&mdash;As he is outlawed, I will pay twenty pounds proclamation money out of what the act of a&s;&s;embly allows in &s;uch ca&s;es, to any per&s;on who &s;hall produce his head &s;evered from his body, and five pounds pro|clamation money if brought home alive."</P>
<P><HI>JOHN MOSLEY.</HI></P>
<P>An adverti&s;ement of the &s;ame kind was printed in <HI>London,</HI> in the general evening-po&s;t, <HI>Jan</HI> 1, 1774, &s;aid to be taken from the <HI>William&s;burgh</HI> gazette, where after de&s;cribing the negro, the ma&s;ter adds, "The &s;aid fellow is outlawed, and I will give ten pounds reward for his head &s;evered from his body, or forty &s;hillings if brought alive." As &s;trange as &s;uch publications may appear to &s;uch who&s;e hearts as are not hardned by the practice of &s;lavery, yet I am informed adverti&s;ements of this kind are fre|quent in the &s;outhern colonies.</P>
<P>It is alledged by the planters in excu&s;e for the&s;e unnatural, the&s;e mon&s;trous cruelties, that the greate&s;t &s;everity, the mo&s;t cruel puni&s;hments, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the management of &s;laves, on account of tho&s;e train of vices which &s;lavery nece&s;&s;arily introduces. A late author remarks how &s;hocking it is to think that tho&s;e unhappy victims mu&s;t from the nature of the thing become danger|ous and refactory, in proportion to the greatne&s;s and genero&s;ity of their minds.</P>
<P>Can there be a more dangerous maxim, than that nece&s;&s;ity is a plea for inju&s;tice? For who &s;hall fix the degree of this nece&s;&s;ity? What villain &s;o atrocious who may not urge this excu&s;e? or as <HI>Milton</HI> expre&s;&s;es it&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;And with nece&s;&s;ity</L>
<L>The tyrant's plea, excu&s;e his dev'li&s;h deed.</L></Q>
<P>How many thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands has this dev'li&s;h plea of nece&s;&s;ity brought to a cruel and untimely end? What account will in future &s;tates of exi&s;tence, be given to the father of the family of mankind, for the lives of &s;o many of our fellow men &s;o inhumanly murdered. A particular in&s;tance of the de&s;truction of human beings, under the pre|tence of nece&s;&s;ity, is related by captain Cook, in his voyage round the world, in company with me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Banks</HI> and <HI>Solander,</HI> in the year 1768, being at <HI>Rio Janiero,</HI> one, if not the principal town of <HI>Brazil;</HI> he relates, page 29, "That the inha|bitants, who are very numerous, con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>Portu|gue&s;e, Negroes</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> The town&s;hip of <HI>Rio Janiero,</HI> which he was told was but a &s;mall part of the province, is &s;aid to contain thirty-&s;even thou&s;and white people, and &s;ix hundred and twen|ty nine thou&s;and blacks, many of whom are free, in the proportion of &s;eventeen to one."</P>
<P>Page 34. (he tells us "The riches of the place con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the mines; that much gold is brought from the&s;e mines, but at an expence of life that mu&s;t &s;trike every man, to whom cu&s;tom has not made it familiar, with horror. No le&s;s than four thou&s;and <HI>Negroes</HI> are annually imported on the king's account to dig in the mines; and (he adds) we are credibly informed, that the la&s;t year but one before we arrived here, this number fell &s;o &s;hort, probably from &s;ome epidemic di&s;ea&s;e, that twenty thou&s;and more were draughted from the town of <HI>Rio Janiero.</HI>"</P></NOTE></P>

<P N="4">IV. 1. This is the plain, un-aggravat|ed matter of fact. Such is the manner wherein our <HI>African</HI> &s;laves are procured: Such the manner wherein they are remov|ed from their native land, and wherein they are treaed in our Plantations.

Whether they can be recon|ciled (&s;etting the Bible out of the que&s;tion) with any degree of either ju&s;tice or mercy.</P>
<P N="2">2. The grand plea is, "They are au|thorized by law." But can law, human law, change the nature of things? Can
<PB N="34" REF="013145_0121_0F8EC2283AB27958">
it turn darkne&s;s into light, or evil into good? By no means. Notwith&s;tanding ten thou&s;and laws, right is right, and wrong is wrong &s;till. There mu&s;t &s;till remain an e&s;&s;ential difference between ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice, cruelty and mercy. So that &s;till I a&s;k, Who can reconcile this treatment of the negroes, fir&s;t and la&s;t, with either mercy or ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Where is the ju&s;tice of inflicting the &s;evere&s;t evils, on tho&s;e that have done us no wrong? Of depriving tho&s;e that ne|ver injured us in word or deed, of every comfort of life? Of tearing them from their native country, and depriving them of liberty it&s;elf? To which an <HI>Angolan,</HI> has the &s;ame natural right as an <HI>Engli&s;h|man,</HI> and on which he &s;ets as high a value? Yea where is the ju&s;tice of taking away the lives of innocent, inoffen&s;ive men? Murdering thou&s;ands of them in their own land, by the hands of their own countrymen: Many thou&s;ands, year after year, on &s;hipboard, and then ca&s;t|ing them like dung into the &s;ea! And tens of thou&s;ands in that cruel &s;lavery, to which they are &s;o unju&s;tly reduced?</P>
<P N="3">3. But waving, for the pre&s;ent, all other con&s;iderations, I &s;trike at the root of this complicated villainy. I ab&s;olute|ly deny all &s;lave-holding to be con&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="35" REF="013145_0121_0F8EC2283AB27958">
with any degreee of even natural ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I cannot place this in a clearer light, than that great ornament of his profe&s;|&s;ion, judge <HI>Black&s;tone</HI> has already done. Part of his words are as follows:</P>
<P>"The three origins of the right of &s;lavery a&s;&s;igned by <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> are all built upon fal&s;e foundations. 1. Slavery is &s;aid to ari&s;e from captivity in war. The conqueror having a right to the life of his captive, if he &s;pares that, has then a right to deal with him as he plea&s;es. But this is untrue, if taken generally, That by the law of nations, a man has a right to kill his enemy. He has only a right to kill him in particular ca&s;es in ca&s;es of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for &s;elf-defence. And it is plain, this ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity did not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, &s;ince he did not kill him, but made him pri&s;oner. War it&s;elf is ju&s;ti|fiable only on principles of &s;elf-pre&s;erva|tion. Therefore it gives us no right o|ver pri&s;oners, but to hinder their hurt|ing us by confining them. Much le&s;s can it give a right to torture, or kill, or even to en&s;lave an enemy when the war is over. Since therefore the right of mak|ing our pri&s;oners &s;laves, depends on a &s;uppo&s;ed right of &s;laughter, that found|dation failing, the con&s;equence which is drawn from it mu&s;t fail likewi&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="013145_0122_0F8EC228A2BF7260">"It is &s;aid, Secondly, &s;lavery may be|gin, by one man's &s;elling him&s;elf to ano|ther. And it is true, a man may &s;ell him|&s;elf to work for another: But he cannot &s;ell him&s;elf to be a &s;lave, as above defined. Every &s;ale implies an equivalent given to the &s;eller, in lieu of what he transfers to the buyer. But what equivalent can be given for life or liberty? His property likewi&s;e, with the very price which he &s;eems to receive, devolves <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> to his ma&s;ter, the in&s;tant he becomes his &s;lave: In this ca&s;e therefore the buyer gives nothing, and the &s;eller receives nothing. Of what validity then can a &s;ale be, which de&s;troys the very principles upon which all &s;ales are founded?"</P>
<P>"We are told, Thirdly, that men may be <HI>born &s;laves,</HI> by being the children of &s;laves. But this being built on the two former rights, mu&s;t fall together with them. If neither captivity, nor contract can by the plain law of nature and rea&s;on, reduce the parent to a &s;tate of &s;lavery, much le&s;s can they reduce the offspring." It clearly follows, that all &s;lavery is as ir|reconcileable to ju&s;tice as to mercy.</P>
<P N="4">4. That &s;lave-holding is utterly incon|&s;i&s;tent with mercy, is almo&s;t too plain to need a proof. Indeed it is &s;aid, "That the&s;e negroes being pri&s;oners of war, our
<PB N="37" REF="013145_0122_0F8EC228A2BF7260">
captains and factors buy them merely to &s;ave them from being put to death. And is not this mercy?" I an&s;wer, 1. Did Sir <HI>John Hawkins,</HI> and many others, &s;eize upon men, women and children, who were at peace in their own fields or hou&s;es, merely to &s;ave them from death? 2. Was it to &s;ave them from death, that they knock'd out the brains of tho&s;e they could not bring away? 3. Who occa&s;ioned and fomented tho&s;e wars, wherein the&s;e poor creatures were taken pri&s;oners? Who excited them by money, by drink, by every po&s;&s;ible means, to fall upon one another? Was it not them&s;elves? They know in their own con&s;cience it was, if they have any con&s;cience left. But 4. To bring the matter to a &s;hort i&s;&s;ue. Can they &s;ay before GOD, That they ever took a &s;ingle voyage, or bought a &s;ingle negro from this motive? They cannot. They well know, to get money, not to &s;ave lives, was the whole and &s;ole &s;pring of their motions.</P>
<P N="5">5. But if this manner of procuring and treating negroes is not con&s;i&s;tent either with mercy or ju&s;tice, yet there is a plea for it which every man of bu&s;ine&s;s will acknowledge to be quite &s;ufficient. Fifty years ago, one meeting an eminent &s;tate&s;|man in the lobby of the hou&s;e of com|mons,
<PB N="38" REF="013145_0123_0F8EC22970DD8968">
&s;aid, "You have been long talking about ju&s;tice and equity. Pray which is this bill? Equity or ju&s;tice?" He an&s;wer|ed, very &s;hort, and plain, "D&mdash;n ju&s;tice: It is nece&s;&s;ity." Here al&s;o the &s;lave-holder fixes his foot: Here he re&s;ts the &s;trength of his cau&s;e. "If it is not quite right, yet it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;o: There is an ab&s;olute <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for it. It is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould procure &s;laves: And when we have procured them, it is nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e them with &s;e|verity, con&s;idering their &s;tupidity, &s;tub|bornne&s;s and wickedne&s;s."</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, You &s;tumble at the thre&s;hold: I deny that villany is ever nece&s;&s;ary. It is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould ever be nece&s;|&s;ary, for any rea&s;onable creature to violate all the laws of ju&s;tice, mercy, and truth. No circum&s;tances can make it nece&s;&s;ary for a man to bur&s;t in &s;under all the ties of humanity. It can never be nece&s;&s;ary for a rational being to &s;ink him&s;elf below a brute. A man can be under no nece&s;&s;ity, of degrading him&s;elf into a wolf. The ab&s;urdity of the &s;uppo&s;ition is &s;o glaring, that one would wonder any one can help &s;eeing it.</P>
<P N="6">6. This in general. But to be more particular, I a&s;k, 1. What is nece&s;&s;ary? And, &s;econdly, To what end? It may be be an&s;wered, "The whole method now
<PB N="39" REF="013145_0123_0F8EC22970DD8968">
u&s;ed by the original purcha&s;ers of negroes, is nece&s;&s;ary to the furni&s;hing our colonies yearly with an hundred thou&s;and &s;laves." I grant, this is nece&s;&s;ary to that end. But how is that end nece&s;&s;ary? How will you prove it nece&s;&s;ary, that one hundred, that one of tho&s;e &s;laves &s;hould be procured? "Why, it is nece&s;&s;ary to my gaining an hundred thou&s;and pounds." Perhaps &s;o: But how is <HI>this</HI> nece&s;&s;ary? It is very po&s;|&s;ible you might be both a better and an happier man, if you had not a quarter of it. I deny that your gaining one thou&s;and is nece&s;&s;ary, either to your pre&s;ent or eternal happine&s;s. "But however you mu&s;t allow, the&s;e &s;laves are nece&s;&s;ary for the cultivation of our i&s;lands; ina&s;much as white men are not able to labour in hot climates<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>It is not propo&s;ed to remove the negroes from labouring in the &s;everal provinces and i&s;lands where they are now employed; in order to employ white men in their &s;tead, what is propo&s;ed, is only to pre|vent any farther import of negroes, except tho&s;e who may come voluntarily and in a free condition; and to fall upon &s;uch ju&s;t regulations and proper encouragement with re&s;pect to tho&s;e already a|mong&s;t us, that from dangerous grudging &s;laves, they may become willing hearted labourers, who having an intere&s;t in the peace and welfare of the country, will be parties in its &s;trength and &s;upport. But whil&s;t deficiencies by the death of the labouring &s;laves can be &s;o ea&s;ily made up by the continual fre&s;h imports from <HI>Guinea,</HI> and the planters find it cheaper to make new purcha&s;es than to rai&s;e the children, or &s;pare and cheri&s;h the parents at tho&s;e already in their &s;ervice, little amendment can be expected in the hard&s;hip they are put to, and the cruelties exerci&s;ed upon them. Surely the number already in our colonies and i&s;lands, which on a calculation made four or five years pa&s;t, was be|tween eight and nine hundred thou&s;and, be&s;ides that there has been a va&s;t number, &s;aid to be about <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> hundred thou&s;and &s;ince yearly imported: all the&s;e, with their increa&s;e, if well u&s;ed, would certainly be &s;ufficient to perform all nece&s;&s;ary la|bour.</P>

<P><HI>John Miller,</HI> profe&s;&s;or of law at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> in his late <HI>ob&s;ervations concerning di&s;tinction of ranks in &s;ociety,</HI> ob&s;erves, "That the &s;lavery e&s;tabli&s;hed in our co|lonies is an object of great importance, and is at|tended with difficulties which cannot be ea&s;ily re|moved. It has been thought that the manage|ment of our plantations requires a labour in which free men would not be willing to engage, and which the white people are from their con&s;titution in|capable of performing. How far this opinion is well founded according to the pre&s;ent manner of labouring in that part of the world, &s;eems difficult to determine, as it has never been properly examin|ed by tho&s;e who are in a condition to a&s;certain the facts in que&s;tion. But there is ground to believe, that the in&s;titution of &s;lavery is the chief circum|&s;tance that has prevented tho&s;e contrivances to &s;horten and facilitate the more laborious employ|ments of the people, which takes place in other coun|tries, where freedom has been introduced. With regard to the planting of &s;ugar, experiments have been made in &s;ome of the i&s;lands, from which it ap|pears, that in &s;ome &s;pecies of cultivation, cattle might be employed with advantage, and that the number of &s;laves might be greatly dimini&s;hed But the&s;e experiments have been little regarded, in op|po&s;ition to the former u&s;age, and in oppo&s;ition to a lucrative branch of trade which the&s;e innova&s;ions would in a great mea&s;ure de&s;troy. At any rate, the intere&s;t of our colonies &s;eems to demand, that the negroes &s;hould be better treated, and even that they &s;hould be rai&s;ed to a better condition.&mdash;The author of a late elegant account of our <HI>American</HI> &s;ettle|ments, has propo&s;ed, that &s;mall wages &s;hould be given them, as an encouragement to indu&s;try. If this mea&s;ure were once begun, it is probable that the ma&s;ter would &s;oon find the utility of pu&s;hing it to a greater extent. Nothing can appear more a&s;toni&s;hing than the little attention that has hitherto been paid to any improvement of this nature, after the good effects of them have been &s;o fully illu&s;trat|ed in the ca&s;e of the villains in <HI>Europe.</HI> At the &s;ame time, it affords a curious &s;pectacle to ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame people who talk in &s;o high a &s;train of political liberty, and who con&s;ider the privilege of impo&s;ing their own taxes, as one of the unalien|able rights of mankind, &s;hould make no &s;cruple of reducing a great proportion of the inhabitants into circum&s;tances by which they are not only deprived of property, but almo&s;t of every right what&s;oever.

<P>We have accounts from <HI>England</HI> of &s;ome regula|tions that have taken place in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> colonies, which do the <HI>Spaniards</HI> much honour, and are cer|tainly worthy our imitation; they are to the follow|ing effect:&mdash;"As &s;oon as a &s;lave is landed, his name, price, &amp;c. are regi&s;tered in a public regi&s;ter, and the ma&s;ter is obliged by law, to allow him <HI>one working day</HI> in every week to him&s;elf, be&s;ides &s;undays: &s;o that if the &s;lave chu&s;es to work for his ma&s;ter on that day, he receives the wages of a freeman for it; and whatever he gains by his labour on that day, is &s;o &s;ecured to him by law, that the ma&s;ter cannot deprive him of it. As &s;oon as the &s;lave is able to purcha&s;e <HI>another working day,</HI> the ma&s;ter is obliged to &s;ell it to him at a proportion|able price, viz. one fifth part of his original co&s;t, and &s;o likewi&s;e the remaining four days at the &s;ame rate, as &s;oon as the &s;lave is able to redeem them; after which <HI>he is ab&s;olutely free.</HI>" This is &s;uch en|couragement to indu&s;try, that even the mo&s;t in|dolent would be tempted to exert them&s;elves.

But, Secondly, the &s;uppo&s;ition on which
<PB N="41" REF="013145_0124_0F8EC22A2A8F7648">
you ground your argument is fal&s;e. For white men, even <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> are well able to labour in hot climates: provided they are temperate both in meat and drink, and that they inure them&s;elves to it by degrees. I &s;peak no more than I know by experience. It appears from the ther|mometer,
<PB N="42" REF="013145_0125_0F8EC22AE2E19C78">
that the &s;ummer heat in <HI>Georgia,</HI> is frequently equal to that in <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> yea to that under the line. And yet I and my family, (eight in number) did em|ploy all our &s;pare time there, in felling of trees and clearing of ground, as hard labour as any negro need be employed in. The <HI>German</HI> family likewi&s;e, forty in number,
<PB N="43" REF="013145_0125_0F8EC22AE2E19C78">
were employed in all manner of labour. And this was &s;o far from impairing our health, that we all continued perfectly well, while the idle ones all round about us, were &s;wept away as with a pe&s;tilence. It is not true therefore that white men are not able to labour, even in hot climates, full as well as black. But if they were not, it would be better that none &s;hould
<PB N="44" REF="013145_0126_0F8EC22BD31D20A0">
labour there, that the work &s;hould be left undone, than that myriads of innocent men &s;hould be murdered, and myriads more dragged into the ba&s;e&s;t &s;lavery.</P>
<P N="7">7. "But the furni&s;hing us with &s;laves is nece&s;&s;ary, for the trade, and wealth, and glory of our nation:" Here are &s;e|veral mi&s;takes. For 1. Wealth is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the glory of any nation; but wi&s;dom, virtue, ju&s;tice, mercy, genero&s;ity, public &s;pirit, love of our country. The&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary to the real glory of a nation; but abundance of wealth is not. Men of under&s;tanding allow, that the glory of <HI>England</HI> was full as high, in Queen <HI>Eliza|beth</HI>'s time as it is now: Although our riches and trade were then as much &s;maller, as our virtue was greater<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>We are told in <HI>Hill's</HI> naval hi&s;tory, page 239, That when captain <HI>Hawkins</HI> returned from his fir&s;t voyage to <HI>Africa,</HI> he was &s;ent for by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who expre&s;&s;ed her concern to him, le&s;t any of the <HI>African</HI> negroes &s;hould be carried off without their free con&s;ent, <HI>declaring it would be dete&s;table, and call down the vengeance of heaven upon the undertakers.</HI>&mdash; Captain <HI>Hawkins</HI> promi&s;ed to comply with the Queen's injunction, but acted quite contrary to his promi&s;e, which occa&s;ioned that author to remark, "That here began the horrid practice of forcing the <HI>Africans</HI> into &s;lavery, an inju&s;tice and barbarity which &s;o &s;ure as there is vengeance in heaven for the wor&s;t of crimes, will &s;ometime be the de&s;truction of all who act, or who encourage it."</P>
<P><HI>Geraldus Cambren&s;is,</HI> a noted author who lived about &s;ix hundred years pa&s;t, in his ob&s;ervations concerning the cau&s;es of the pro&s;perity of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> undertakings in <HI>Ireland,</HI> when they conquered that i&s;land, tells us, "That a &s;ynod or council of the clergy being then a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Armagh,</HI> and that point fully debated, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, that the &s;ins of the people were the occa&s;ion of that heavy judgment then fallen upon their nation; and that e&s;pecially their buying of <HI>Engli&s;h men</HI> from merchants and pirates, and detaining them under mo&s;t mi&s;erable hard bondage, had cau&s;ed the <HI>Lord</HI> by way of ju&s;t retaliation, to leave them to be reduc|ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to the &s;ame &s;tate of &s;lavery; where|upon they made a public act in that council, that all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> held in captivity throughout the whole land &s;hould be pre&s;ently re&s;tored to their former liberty."</P></NOTE>.

no wealth, than to gain wealth, at the ex|pence of virtue. Better is hone&s;t poverty, than all the riches bought by the tears, and &s;weat, and blood of our fellow-crea|tures.</P>
<P N="8">8. "However this be, it is nece&s;&s;ary when we have &s;laves, to u&s;e them with &s;everity." What, to whip them for every petty offence, till they are all in gore blood?

To hang them on gibbets, that they may die by inches, with heat, and hunger, and thir&s;t? To pin them down to the ground, and then burn them by degrees, from the feet, to the head? To roa&s;t them alive? When did a Turk or a Heathen find it nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e a fellow-creature thus?</P>
<P>I pray, to what end is this u&s;age nece&s;|&s;ary? "Why, to prevent their running away: And to keep them con&s;tantly to their labour, that they may not idle away their time.

Who give them no means, no opportu|nity of improving their under&s;tanding: And indeed leave them no motive, either from hope or fear, to attempt any &s;uch thing. They were no way remarkable for &s;tupidity, while they remained in their own country: The inhabitants of <HI>Africa</HI> where they have equal motives and equal means of improvement, are not inferior to the inhabitants of <HI>Europe:</HI> To &s;ome of them they are greatly &s;uperior.

Have you tried what mildne&s;s and gentlene&s;s would do?

Why, that all his negroes (And he had no &s;mall number of them) loved and reverenced him as a father, and chearfully obeyed him out of love. Yea, they were more afraid of a frown from <HI>him,</HI> than of many blows from an over&s;eer. And what pains have <HI>you</HI> taken, what method have you u&s;ed, to reclaim them from their wickedne&s;s? Have you carefully taught them, "That there is a GOD, a wi&s;e, powerful, merciful Being, the Creator and Governor of Heaven and Earth? That he has appoint|ed a day wherein he will judge the world, will take an account of all our thoughts, words and actions? That in that day he will reward every child of man according to his works: That "then the righteous &s;hall inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world: And the wicked &s;hall be ca&s;t into ever|la&s;ting

What wonder, if they &s;hould cut your throat? And if they did, whom could you thank for it but your&s;elf? You fir&s;t acted the villain in making them &s;laves, (whether you &s;tole them or bought them.) You kept them &s;tupid and wick|ed, by cutting them off from all appor|tunities of improving either in know|ledge or virtue: And now you a&s;&s;ign their want of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s as the rea|&s;on for u&s;ing them wor&s;e than brute bea&s;ts!</P>
<P N="5">V. 1. It remains only, to make a little application of the preceding ob&s;ervations. &mdash;But to whom &s;hould that application be made? That may bear a que&s;tion. Should we addre&s;s our&s;elves to the public at large? What effect can this have? It may inflame the world again&s;t the guilty, but is not likely to remove that guilt. Should we appeal to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation in general? This al&s;o is &s;triking wide: And is never likely to procure any redre&s;s, for the &s;ore evil we complain of.&mdash;As little would it in all probability avail, to apply to the par|liament.

<P N="2">2. And, fir&s;t, to the captains employed in this trade. Mo&s;t of <HI>you</HI> know, the country of <HI>Guinea:</HI> Several parts of it at lea&s;t, between the river <HI>Senegal</HI> and the kingdom of <HI>Angola.</HI> Perhaps now, by <HI>your</HI> means, part of it is become a dreary uncultivated wilderne&s;s, the inhabitants being all murdered or carried away, &s;o that there are none left to till the ground. But you well know, how populous, how fruitful, how plea&s;ant it was a few years ago. You know the people were not &s;tupid, not wanting in &s;en&s;e, con&s;idering the few means of improvement they en|joyed. Neither did you find them &s;avage, fierce, cruel, treacherous, or unkind to &s;trangers. On the contrary, they were in mo&s;t parts a &s;en&s;ible and ingenious people. They were kind and friendly, courteous and obliging, and remarkably fair and ju&s;t in their dealings. Such are the men whom you hire their own coun|trymen, to tear away from this lovely country; part by &s;tealth, part by force, part made captives in tho&s;e wars, which you rai&s;e or foment on purpo&s;e. You have &s;een them torn away, children from
<PB N="51" REF="013145_0129_0F8EC231A66C97F8">
their parents, parents from their children: Hu&s;bands from their wives, wives from their beloved hu&s;bands, brethren and &s;i&s;ters from each other. You have drag|ged them who had never done you any wrong, perhaps in chains, from their na|tive &s;hore. You have forced them into your &s;hips like an herd of &s;wine, them who had &s;ouls immortal as your own: (Only &s;ome of them have leaped into the &s;ea, and re&s;olutely &s;tayed under water, till they could &s;uffer no more from you.) You have &s;towed them together as clo&s;e as ever they could lie, without any regard either to decency or convenience. &mdash;And when many of them had been poi&s;oned by foul air, or had &s;unk under various hard&s;hips, you have &s;een their remains delivered to the deep, till the &s;ea &s;hould give up his dead. You have carried the &s;urvivors into the vile&s;t &s;lavery, never to end but with life: Such &s;lavery as is not found among the <HI>Turks</HI> at <HI>Algiers,</HI> no, nor among the heathens in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. May I &s;peak plainly to you? I mu&s;t. Love con&s;trains me: Love to <HI>you,</HI> as well as to tho&s;e you are concerned with.</P>
<P>Is there a GOD? You know there is. Is He a ju&s;t GOD? Then there mu&s;t be a &s;tate of retribution: A &s;tate wherein the ju&s;t GOD will reward every man according to

his works. Then what reward will he render to <HI>you?</HI> O think betimes! Before you drop into eternity! Think now, <HI>He &s;hall have judgment without mercy, that &s;hewed no mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Are you <HI>a man?</HI> Then you &s;hould have an <HI>human</HI> heart. But have you indeed? What is your heart made of? Is there no &s;uch principle as compa&s;&s;ion there? Do you never <HI>feel</HI> another's pain? Have you no &s;ympathy? No &s;en&s;e of human woe? No pity for the mi&s;erable? When you &s;aw the flowing eyes, the heaving brea&s;ts, or the bleeding &s;ides and tortured limbs of your fellow-creatures, was you a &s;tone, or a brute? Did you look upon them with the eyes of a tiger? When you &s;queezed the agonizing creatures down in the &s;hip, or when you threw their poor mangled remains into the &s;ea, had you no relent|ing? Did not one tear drop from your eye, one &s;igh e&s;cape from your brea&s;t? Do you feel no relenting <HI>now?</HI> If you do not, you mu&s;t go on, till the mea&s;ure of your iniquities is full. Then will the great GOD deal with <HI>you,</HI> as you have dealt with <HI>them,</HI> and require all their blood at your hands. And at that day it &s;hall be more tolerable for <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gemorrah</HI> than for <HI>you!</HI> But if your heart does relent, though in a &s;mall degree, know it is a call from
<PB N="53" REF="013145_0130_0F8EC2326180EF50">
the GOD of love. And to day, if you hear his voice, harden not your heart.&mdash; To day re&s;olve, GOD being your helper, to e&s;cape for your life.&mdash;Regard not money!

<P N="4">4. This equally concerns every mer|chant, who is engaged in the &s;lave-trade.

It is <HI>your</HI> money, that is the &s;pring of all, that impowers him to go on: So that whatever he or the <HI>African</HI> does in this matter, is all <HI>your</HI> act and deed.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>The fir&s;t is taken from the late writings of <HI>Edward Bancroft,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> phy&s;ician, who re&s;ided &s;ome years in that part of <HI>America,</HI> called <HI>Dutch Guiana,</HI> which in|cludes the &s;everal &s;ettlements of <HI>Surinam, Barbices, Demarara,</HI> &amp;c. The in&s;en&s;ibility with which this author relates and vin|dicates the cruelties and indignities ex|erci&s;ed, by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> on the mi&s;erable <HI>Africans,</HI> &s;hew that the advantage accruing to him from the labour of the &s;laves, as well as his connection with their oppre&s;|&s;ors, had its u&s;ual and natural effects, in ob&s;curing his under&s;tanding, and hardning his heart again&s;t the dictates of rea&s;on and humanity.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="013145_0133_0F8EC234E448E8F0">The <HI>French</HI> author appears to have been in a very different &s;ituation; he was an officer belonging to the troops quartered in the i&s;land <HI>Mauritus,</HI> now called <HI>The I&s;le of France,</HI> who not reaping any advantage from the labour of the &s;laves, nor having any dependence on the planters, his mind remained &s;o unprejudiced, that the dic|tates of rea&s;on and tender feelings of hu|manity, had free liberty to exert them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Bancroft,</HI> whil&s;t he is giving his readers a genuine relation of the prodi|gious oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty exerci&s;ed on the negroes, advances &s;uch arguments in defence of the practice of &s;lavery, as are, indeed, a di&s;honour to rea&s;on, and &s;hock|ing to humanity. He tells us, <Q>That the labour of the country is almo&s;t wholly performed by negroes&mdash;that they are kept at a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and hum|ble di&s;tance, by &s;everity of di&s;cipline,</Q> which he is &s;o hardned as to &s;ay, <Q>not only contributes to the &s;afety of the white inhabitants, but even the happi|ne&s;s of the &s;laves, becau&s;e, adds he, the impo&s;&s;ibility of attaining is ever found to de&s;troy the de&s;ire of enjoyment, and rigid treatment, by annihilating every hope of liberty, renders the &s;laves con|tent with the enjoyment of &s;lavery.</Q>&mdash;
<PB N="60" REF="013145_0134_0F8EC23576223338">
He acknowledges, <Q>That the negroes are indeed &s;purred to indu&s;try by the whip of correction, which is ever at their heels, and not &s;paringly exerci&s;ed; but, that there is no medium: either the minds of the &s;laves mu&s;t be de|pre&s;&s;ed by abject &s;lavery, or the lives of the ma&s;ters are in imminent danger: For this rea&s;on (he &s;ays) they have been oppre&s;&s;ed by many humiliating penalties and di&s;tinctions. The evi|dence of &s;laves relating to white per&s;ons are of no validity. An attempt to &s;trike a white inhabitant is puni&s;hed with death. Their ma&s;ters or over&s;eers have not only the power of inflicting cor|poral puni&s;hment, but are in &s;ome mea&s;ure allowed to exerci&s;e a right over their lives, &s;ince the putting a negro to death is attended only with a pecu|niary puni&s;hment. In which &s;ituation, he confe&s;&s;es, they are &s;ubject to many complicated &s;pecies of mi&s;ery, expo&s;ed to the tyrann<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the imperious, and lu&s;t of the libidinous; and to an in|ce&s;&s;ant toil which will have no period but with their lives.</Q> Thus this au|thor thro' the whole of his rea&s;oning, ma|nife&s;tly &s;hews the depraving effect which the &s;ight and practice of tho&s;e hard and cruel mea&s;ures which are attendant on

&s;lavery, has upon the heart and rea&s;on of men, otherwi&s;e of good judgment.&mdash; Hence he adds, <Q>That tho' this treat|ment has the appearance of cruelty, and cannot be reconciled to the principles of ju&s;tice and equity, yet many things which are repugnant to humanity, may be excu&s;ed on account of their nece&s;&s;ity and for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation.</Q>&mdash;Speaking of the provi&s;ion made for the negroes in food and cloathing, he &s;ays, <Q>The ex|pence of maintaining them in this climate is very trifling&mdash;they are a&s;&s;igned a piece of ground, from this the &s;lave is &s;upplied with a &s;ufficient &s;tock for his &s;u&s;tenance; on which however he is not allowed to labour but only on &s;undays; receiving from his ma&s;ter a weekly allowance of dried fi&s;h to the amount of a pound and an half; which is all that his ma&s;ter con|tributes towards his food. The females receive the &s;ame treatment, and the drink of both is nothing but water: yet from this water and vegetables, with a mor&s;el of dried fi&s;h, the&s;e people derive &s;ufficient nutriment to &s;u&s;tain the harde&s;t labour in the mo&s;t enervat|ing climate. The cloathing of the ne|groes (who work in the fields) is &s;carce &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the demands of</Q>

indignation again&s;t the murderer, or commi&s;eration for the unhappy victim; they &s;eemed quite hardned to &s;uch &s;cenes. He heard but one per&s;on take any man|ner of notice of the matter.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance fell under the imme|diate notice of a per&s;on of credit, when in the i&s;land of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> now re&s;iding in this city. Hearing a grievous cry, he went to the place from whence it came, where he &s;aw a young negro wo|man of about eighteen years of age, &s;wung by her hands, with heavy weights at her feet, and a man la&s;hing her naked body with a hard whip; making pau&s;es from time to time, and flinging pickle or &s;alt and water on the wounds, the whip had made. The &s;ight was &s;o hor|rible, that he turned from it and came home. Sometime after, looking out, he &s;aw this &s;ame young woman carried dead on a board: She had been cruelly whip|ped to death; neither did he ob&s;erve that this pitious &s;pectacle drew the concern or hardly attention of the peo|ple.</P>
<P>A third in&s;tance happened in <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of a per&s;on now re&s;iding there. A ve&s;&s;el had taken in a number of &s;laves, on the coa&s;t of Guinea, among&s;t the&s;e was a man, who probably
<PB N="73" REF="013145_0135_0F8EC111B0B07658">
from the dignity of his &s;ituation in his own country, or from &s;ome other cau&s;e, did not &s;hew &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as the &s;hip's people expected and require of &s;laves. They attempted to tie him with ropes, but that not an&s;wering their purpo&s;e, they confined him in irons, and other|wi&s;e &s;o tormented him during their pa&s;|&s;age from <HI>Guinea,</HI> in order to bring down his &s;pirit, that when they arrived at <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> he was in &s;o weak a con|dition as to be &s;carce able to walk to the place of &s;ale, but as he was urged on with the whip. When the &s;laves re|turned in the evening, this man remain|ing un&s;old, was forced along with the re&s;t towards the ve&s;&s;el, he walked on for a while, till he came to the market-place, where he fell; but the whip being exerci&s;ed upon him, he ro&s;e, and going on a little farther dropt down dead. The relater, a per&s;on of credit, &s;aw the tran&s;action, and exclaimed again&s;t the barbarity; but no notice was taken, ei|ther judicially or otherwi&s;e; he was dragged along and flung into the &s;ea, to be devoured by the &s;harks.</P>
<P>The la&s;t in&s;tance I &s;hall mention, hap|pened in <HI>Carolina,</HI> on board a ve&s;&s;el with &s;laves from <HI>Guinea,</HI> related by a per|&s;on lately in this city from thence. It

&s;eems the poor negroes had let in a per|&s;ua&s;ion, from a fire appearing on the &s;hore, that the white people propo&s;ed to put them to death; this made them unwilling to leave the &s;hip: However they were all made to comply except one man, who had taken &s;o &s;trong hold of &s;ome part of the &s;hip, that the &s;ailors were not able to loo&s;e him. This rai&s;ed the anger of the captain to &s;o great a degree, that he &s;truck the poor fellow &s;o hard a blow, with &s;omething like an hand&s;pike, as broke both his arms, whereby the captain looking upon the fellow as di&s;abled and unfit for &s;ale, gave him another blow on the head, which cau&s;ed his brains to fly about the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>"We know, &s;ays a late re&s;pectable author, that the negroes (employed in our plantations) are purcha&s;ed from their princes in <HI>Guinea,</HI> who pretend to have a right to di&s;po&s;e of them, and that they are like other commodities, tran&s;ported by the merchants, who have bought them into <HI>America,</HI> in or|der to be expo&s;ed to &s;ale. If this trade admits of a moral or a rational ju&s;tifi|cation, every crime, even the mo&s;t atro|cious, may be ju&s;tified. Government

was in&s;tituted for the good of mankind; kings, princes, governors, are not pro|prietors of tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to their authority; they have not a right to make them mi&s;erable. On the contrary, their authority is ve&s;ted in them, that they may, by the ju&s;t exerci&s;e of it, pro|mote the happine&s;s of their people. Of cour&s;e they have not a right to di&s;po&s;e of their liberty, and to &s;ell them for &s;laves. Be&s;ides, no man has a right to acquire or to purcha&s;e them: Men and their liberty are not either &s;ileable or purcha&s;eable.&mdash;No one, therefore, has any but him&s;elf to blame, in ca&s;e he &s;hall find him&s;elf deprived of a man, whom he thought he had, by buying for a price, made his own; for he dealt in a trade which was illicit, and was prohi|bited by the mo&s;t obvious dictates of humanity. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, every one of tho&s;e unfortunate men, who are pre|tended to be &s;laves, has a right to be de|clared to be free, for he never lo&s;t his liberty; he could not lo&s;e it; his prince had no power to di&s;po&s;e of him. Of cour&s;e the &s;ale was <HI>ip&s;o jure</HI> void. This right he carries about with him, and is entitled every where to get declared. As &s;oon, therefore, as he comes into a country in which the judges are not for|getful
<PB N="76" REF="013145_0137_0F8EC113464D3860">
of their own humanity, it is their duty to remember that he is a man, and to declare him to be free. I know it has been &s;aid, that que&s;tions concerning the &s;tate of per&s;ons ought to be determined by the law of the country to which they belong; and that, therefore, one who would be declared to be a &s;lave in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> ought, in ca&s;e he &s;hould happen to be imported into <HI>Britain,</HI> to be adjudged according to the law of <HI>America</HI> to be a &s;lave; a doctrine, than which nothing can be more barbarous. Ought the judges of any country, out of re&s;pect to the law of another, to &s;hew no re&s;pect to their kind and to humanity. Out of re&s;pect to a law, which is in no &s;ort ob|ligatory upon them, ought they to di&s;|regard the law of nature, which is obli|gatory on all men at all times, and in all places: Are any laws &s;o binding as the eternal laws of ju&s;tice? It is doubt|ful, whether a judge ought to pay great|er regard to them, than to tho&s;e arbitra|ry and inhuman u&s;ages which prevail in a di&s;tant land? Aye, but our colonies would be ruined, if &s;lavery was aboli&s;h|ed. Be it &s;o; would it not from thence follow, that the bulk of mankind ought to be abu&s;ed, that our pockets may be filled with money, or our mouths with
<PB N="77" REF="013145_0137_0F8EC113464D3860">
delicacies? The pur&s;es of highwaymen would be empty in ca&s;e robberies were totally aboli&s;hed; but have men a right to acquire money by going out to the high|way? Have men a right to acquire it by rendering their fellow creatures mi&s;era|ble? Is it lawful to abu&s;e mankind, that the avarice, the vanity, or the pa&s;&s;ion of a few may be gratified? No! There is &s;uch a thing as ju&s;tice, to which the mo&s;t &s;acred regard is due. It ought to be in|violably ob&s;erved. Have not the&s;e un|happy men a better right to their liber|ty and to their happine&s;s, than our <HI>Ame|rican</HI> merchants have to the profits which they make by torturing their kind? Let therefore our colonies be ruined, but let us not render &s;o many men mi&s;erables. Would not any of us, who &s;hould&mdash;be &s;natched by pirates from his native land, think him&s;elf cruelly abu&s;ed, and at all times intiled to be free. Have not the&s;e unfortunate <HI>Africans,</HI> who meet with the &s;ame cruel fate, the &s;ame right? Are not they men as well as we, and have they not the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility?"</P>
<P>"But it is fal&s;e, that either we, or our colonies would be ruined by the aboli|tion of &s;lavery. It might oeca&s;ion a &s;tag|nation of bu&s;ine&s;s for a &s;hort time. Every great alteration produces that effect: Be|cau&s;e

mankind cannot on a &s;udden, find ways of di&s;po&s;ing of them&s;elves and of their affairs: But it would produce many happy effects. It is the &s;lavery which is permitted in <HI>America</HI> that has hindered it from becoming &s;o populous, as it would otherwi&s;e have done. Let the negroes free, and in a few generations, this va&s;t and fertile continent, would be crowded with inhabitants; learning, arts, and every thing would flouri&s;h among&s;t them: In&s;tead of being inhabited by wild bea&s;ts, and by &s;avages, it would be peopled by philo&s;ophers, and by men." <HI>Prins. law of Scott.</HI></P>
<P>"He who detains another by force in &s;lavery, is always bound to prove his title. The &s;lave &s;old or carried into a di&s;tant country, mu&s;t not be obliged to prove a negative, that <HI>he never forfeited his liberty.</HI> The violent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or mu&s;t in all ca&s;es &s;hew his title, e&s;pecially where the old proprietor is well known. In this ca&s;e, each man is the original proprietor of his own liberty. The proof of his lo&s;ing it mu&s;t be incumbent on tho&s;e who de|prive him of it by force." <HI>Sy&s;t. mor. phil.</HI></P>
<P>"Long and &s;erious reflections upon the nature and con&s;equences of &s;lavery have
<PB N="79" REF="013145_0138_0F8EC113F2DEB098">
convinced me, that it is a violation both of ju&s;tice and religion; that it is danger|ous to the &s;afety of the community in which it prevails; that is it de&s;tructive to the growth of arts and &s;ciences; and la&s;tly, that it produces a numerous and very fatal train of vices, both in the &s;lave, and in his ma&s;ter.&mdash;Freedom is unque&s;tionably the birth right of all man|kind; <HI>Africans</HI> as well as <HI>Europeans:</HI> to keep the former in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, is a con&s;tant violation of that right, and therefore al&s;o of ju&s;tice.&mdash;The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> merchants obtains the negroes form <HI>A|frica,</HI> by violence, artifice, and treachery, with a few trinkets to prompt tho&s;e un|fortunate people, to en&s;lave one another, by force or &s;tratagem. Purcha&s;e them, indeed they may, under the authority of an act of the <HI>Briti&s;h parliament.</HI> An act entailing upon the <HI>Africans</HI> (with whom we were not at war, and over whom a <HI>Briti&s;h parliament</HI> could not of right a&s;&s;ume even a &s;hadow of authority) the dreadful cur&s;e of perpetual &s;lavery, upon them and their children forever. <HI>There cannot be in nature, there is not in all hi&s;tory, an in&s;tance in which every right of men is more flagrantly violated."

this violation, it hath been pretended, that though indeed the&s;e mi&s;erable out|ca&s;ts of humanity be torn from their homes and native country by fraud and violence, yet they thereby become the happier, and their condition the more eligible.

To know what con&s;titutes mine or your happine&s;s, is the &s;ole prerogative of him who created us, and ca&s;t us in &s;o various and differ|ent moulds.

<HEAD>Pure and Spiritual Wor&s;hip: A SERMON. <HI>Preached at</HI> DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <HI>November</HI> 12, 1690.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY STEPHEN CRISP.</BYLINE>
<P>THE Wor&s;hip of God, of the Great God, is pure: he is a Holy God, <HI>Of Purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity;</HI> and they who will wor&s;hip God, who&s;e Souls are breathing to have a Return of a Te&s;timony in his Sight, mu&s;t offer up pure Wor&s;hip, and it mu&s;t come from that which is pure: For that purpo&s;e the Greatne&s;s of the Love of God is made manife&s;t in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and there is a diffu&s;ing of his Grace and Vir|tue in the Hearts of the Sons and Daughters of Men, whereby he hath laid a Foundation for his own Wor&s;hip; becau&s;e his Wor&s;hip mu&s;t be pure. Therefore he hath freely
<PB N="4" REF="013145_0142_0F8EC11B04B5BBF8">
given unto us, through his Son, the Know|ledge of that pure Principle of Life and Grace, from whence and out of which, all true Wor&s;hip doth &s;pring, and all true Ho|nour to God ari&s;eth, and real Obedience to his holy Will &s;prings forth out of that which is from him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And therefore all that will be Wor&s;hippers of God aright, mu&s;t fir&s;t know and be &s;en|&s;ible wherein the Ability and Capacity &s;tands, that may enable them to &s;o great and &s;o good a Work. Some have conceived it to &s;tand in their own Will, and according to the Working of their own Will, they have framed Wor&s;hips, Religions, and Ob|&s;ervations, thinking thereby to plea&s;e God: But you know the Apo&s;tle in a few &s;hort Words lays down a po&s;itive Chri&s;tian Doc|trine, <HI>Without Faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God.</HI></P>
<P>Now this doth declare and &s;ignify, that there mu&s;t be &s;omething upon which this Faith mu&s;t work, that mu&s;t be the Object and Foundation of it: Faith as it worketh in the Creature, worketh upon &s;omething; it lays hold upon &s;omething in which there is a Ca|pacity of plea&s;ing God. Now if <HI>we are all by Nature Children of Wrath,</HI> and that no one of him&s;elf can plea&s;e God, then there mu&s;t be &s;omething that is &s;upernatural that mu&s;t be the object of that Faith, by which Men
<PB N="5" REF="013145_0142_0F8EC11B04B5BBF8">
alone can plea&s;e God; and this mu&s;t be made manife&s;t to the Creature for its Help, for to be its Director and Supporter in that Work, that is too mighty for him&s;elf, too great a Work for a Man or Woman, too deep, too profound for any Man's Abilities, Power, Wi&s;dom, and Acquirements, that he can at|tain to in this World, to wor&s;hip God a|right: To wor&s;hip God, that is, to perform a pure Wor&s;hip to a pure God; <HI>Who can bring a clean Thing out of an unclean?</HI> Now if we are all obliged to bring a clean Wor&s;hip, a pure Wor&s;hip to a pure and Holy God, who hath created us and all Things; where &s;hall we have it? Not out of an unclean Heart, not out Of a defiled Mind; there is no bringing it forth from thence, for that is the State and Condition that Men are fallen into by Sin, in which their Minds and Con&s;ciences are defiled, their Hearts are pol|luted, and their Affections depraved and &s;et upon wrong Objects; and in this State none can &s;erve God aright: That which is pure and holy mu&s;t be fir&s;t made known, revealed, di&s;covered and believed before Peo|ple can perform a right Wor&s;hip to God.</P>
<P>And therefore in vain it is, to go and drive People to this and that Wor&s;hip, and force People to this and that Service and Confor|mity, upon the Account of the Wor&s;hip of God. This is vain Wor&s;hip; when they

have done all, it is not acceptable to God; the poor Creature hath no return from the the Lord, for God accepts no Service or Wor&s;hip, but only thro' his Son. And if &s;o be, Men cannot pray and preach in the Spi|rit of his Son, and cannot pre&s;ent their com|plaints and Supplications to God, but by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Help of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, there is no Rea&s;on in Religion why People &s;hould expect a Return and An&s;wer from God of the Prayers they make: For it is the general Doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> That Chri&s;t Je&s;us is appointed of God for a Mediator between God and Man, and all the Accept|ance we have, or de&s;ire to have, mu&s;t be through him: and therefore if we pray without him, and perform this and the other Duties without him; it is contrary to the Doctrine of Chri&s;tianity to think that ever we &s;hould have Acceptance in God's Sight.</P>
<P>Therefore there is a Nece&s;&s;ity for every Man and Woman that de&s;ires to be religious, that hath a religious Mind, and is willing to wor&s;hip God, and &s;erve God aright, there is a Nece&s;&s;ity that they come to the Know|ledge of Chri&s;t, who tells us that he is <HI>The Way to the Father:</HI> They that go any other Way go a wrong Way: but they that go unto God by Chri&s;t, they do receive from him Power to draw near to God; and
<PB N="7" REF="013145_0143_0F8EC11B68A78438">
through him they receive from God all tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings that their Souls &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>So here would be an End of all Religions the World is full of, of all the &s;everal Wor|&s;hips that Men have made: They have in|vented and found out &s;everal Ways for Peo|ple to wor&s;hip and &s;erve God; This and the other Ceremony, this and the other Ob&s;erva|tion and Method of Preaching and Praying: If all this be without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Di|vine Help of the Mediator, thro' whom a|lone we can ju&s;tly expect Acceptance at God's Hands, it is all good for nothing. Therefore the fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on of a Chri&s;tian in Point of Wor&s;hip, is that he come to the Knowledge of Chri&s;t, by whom, and thro' whom he may expect Favour with God.</P>
<P>Now &s;ay &s;ome People, We are already come to the Knowledge of Chri&s;t, we have read the Relation in the Go&s;pel of his Con|ception, Birth, Life and Death, Re&s;urrecti|on and A&s;cen&s;ion: Now whether this Belief doth give a Man this Kind of Chri&s;tian Knowledge, that doth open a Door and Way for him into the Pre&s;ence of God: This is a Que&s;tion that ought &s;eriou&s;ly to be con&s;idered, for if we err in this Que&s;tion, we err in all; this is like &s;tumbling at the Thre&s;hold, and never come into the Hou&s;e. If we mi&s;take in laying hold of Chri&s;t, we
<PB N="8" REF="013145_0144_0F8EC11C382181C0">
mi&s;take in our Wor&s;hip, and in all Matters that relate to Life and Salvation.</P>
<P>For if we mu&s;t have another Sort of Knowledge of Chri&s;t than we can have from the Reports of others; if I mu&s;t have Chri&s;t revealed in me before I can have the Hope of Glory; if I mu&s;t have the Spirit of Chri&s;t in me, to help me to put up my Reque&s;ts and Supplications before he can pre&s;ent them to the Father, then all literal Know|ledge and Faith cannot &s;tand Men in any Stead, but this is evident by the Te&s;timony of all the Writers of the New Te&s;tament. Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles did concurrently &s;ignify, that the Hope of a Chri&s;tian, that the Power and Strength of a Chri&s;tian, it all lies in this, in that they had known the Re|velation of Chri&s;t, and the powerful Opera|tion of the Spirit working in them; this was that which was well plea&s;ing to God; ma|ny Scriptures might be &s;poken of, but you know the Scriptures, and can read them, and &s;ee in them the concurrent Te&s;timony of all Holy Men to this Day, that the Know|ledge they had of Chri&s;t was a divine Know|ledge, a &s;piritual Knowledge, it was know|ing him after the Spirit, it was a Revelation of Chri&s;t in them, that &s;eparated and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them from Reprobates, even the Knowledge of God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t their Lord: Why &s;hould not we come to this

<P>So that a Chri&s;tian hath a Foundation for his Wor&s;hip and Chri&s;tian Performance; what is that Foundation?

Carnal Men that are in Death and Darkne&s;s,

<P>Now, that I may &s;peak intelligibly what the Lord hath laid upon my Heart, I would &s;ay thus; There is an univer&s;al Benefit and Privilege di&s;tributed and given freely of God, unto the Sons and Daughters of Men, in their natural State, through his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in that he hath cau&s;ed his Light to &s;hine, and his Grace to be extended to eve|ry Man; <HI>for the Grace of God</HI> which bringeth Salvation (for it is not by Works) <HI>hath ap|peared unto all Men,</HI> and bringeth Light, by which every Man may &s;ee how to wor&s;hip God; God hath enlightened every Man, and this Light comes by Chri&s;t the Mediator; this Mediator is the Way that Men mu&s;t walk in, if they will come back again to God; for Men are run out and departed from God; if Men will draw near to God, and take &s;ome Foot&s;teps towards the Kingdom of God, from the Kingdom of Sin and Satan, they mu&s;t mind the Way, the Way mu&s;t be their Director, they mu&s;t not go which Way they li&s;t.</P>
<P>This is that which was prophe&s;ied of Chri&s;t, &s;aith God by the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah, I

As &s;oon as a Man takes hold of Chri&s;t, his Grace, and Spirit, and Life, he will be ready to &s;ay, I am corrupt, my Sen|&s;es are corrupt, my Mind is depraved, my Con&s;cience defiled and polluted; but I have found out &s;omething or that God hath be&s;tow|ed upon me, that is E&s;&s;ential, Holy and Pure, that did never con&s;ent to my Cor|ruption, but is a Witne&s;s for God again&s;t it: Here now a Chri&s;tian lays hold on Chri&s;t, the Leader; which Way will he lead me? If thou laye&s;t hold of this Guide, he will lead thee out of Evil, he will teach thee to cea&s;e to do Evil, and &s;peak Evil: This Light will lead thee to Nothing that will di&s;honour God, or defile thy own Soul: But this is not all, we mu&s;t not only cea&s;e to do Evil, but we mu&s;t be doing &s;omething; there mu&s;t be a breaking off from Pride, <HI>Fooli&s;h Je&s;ting, Evil Communication;</HI> but this is not all that he will lead me to; let us learn that Le&s;&s;on, <HI>Cea&s;e to do Evil.</HI> This Doctrine was preach|ed before Chri&s;tianity was preached, as it is now preached; the Prophets of old preach|ed this Doctrine to the <HI>Jews</HI> that were un|der an outward Admini&s;tration, <HI>Cea&s;e to do

<P>This is the fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on that a true Chri&s;ti|an learns in his turning to God, in his Change and Tran&s;lation, <HI>to cea&s;e from that which is Evil:</HI> Here is a Ce&s;&s;ation of Rebel|lion, and her is &s;ome hopes of being recon|ciled to God; a Man hath beer a Rebel a|gain&s;t his Maker, but he hath now received help to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e Temptations that prevail over him: But there is no wor&s;hipping yet, there is a forward mind in Men to do &s;ome|thing that is plea&s;ing to God; but there are &s;ome that are not troubled at all for their Evil Ways, and dread not God's Anger, but make a mock at Sin, that draws others to it, and make them&s;elves merry in it: But there is a &s;ort &s;o far touched with a divine Sen&s;e of God's Love to them, that they have al&s;o a Sen&s;e of his Anger and Indignation, becau&s;e of their Sin; and they would fain be out of his Anger; and who can blame them? When a Man feels the Anger of God burn|ing like a Fire in his Bo&s;om, who can blame that Man if he de&s;ire Peace with God? If he be under a Sen&s;e of the Di&s;plea&s;ure and In|dignation of the Almighty, he mu&s;t not

ha&s;te too &s;oon out of that Condition he is brought into; for this is God's Purpo&s;e, and this is the Fruit of all his Troubles and Afflictions, to take away Sin: God had no other End or De&s;ign in the Affliction that came upon him, than to take away Sin; when God hath brought a People into a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and dejected State for their Sin, the Fruit that God expects, is the <HI>taking away of their Sin,</HI> and he will hide Pride from them, and humble them before him; if this be the Purpo&s;e of God that he intends to purge and purify his People; then &s;aith the poor Creature, if God de&s;ign to purify me from Sin, then I will pray to God to &s;up|port me, and bear me up under his Indigna|tion: That is the Cry of the Soul that he may not be brought too &s;oon from under the Judgment of God, but he may be &s;upported and hid in the Hollow of God's Hand, until the Time of Remi&s;&s;ion and Refre&s;hing comes, that he may behold the Light of God's Countenance.</P>
<P>Here is Encouragement for every one that is acquainted with this divine Principle of Grace, that will be led by it, and follow it &s;o far as to be led out of Evil; then they will be fitted to do &s;omething in the Work of God; every Sigh and Groan that thou ha&s;t the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of God to help thee in, is Part of Wor&s;hip: All thy

It is nothing in Religion for People to go from Praying and Preaching to Sinning; but God mu&s;t have a holy Sacrifice, and that mu&s;t come out of a pure Heart: Now when a Man is brought by the Help of God, and by the divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Mediator, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to break off from his Sin, then he &s;tands fair to become a Child of God, and to be a Servant of God, and to do &s;omething for God in his Generation, and to offer to God Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving, and to per|form all other Duties that God &s;hall lead him into.</P>

&s;omething that plea&s;es not God, I had bet|ter let it alone; and I can do nothing ac|ceptable to God without divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance: Such an one that &s;ees his own Impotency and Inability will ca&s;t his Care upon God, and will &s;ay, The Lord is able to lead me and guide me: I am ready to do thy Will, O God: Make it clear to me that this is thy Will, and that this is that which thou re|quire&s;t, I am ready to do it, tho' it be cro&s;s to mine own Will: He is ready to go on in God's Way, in the Way of Chri&s;tianity; &s;uch an one that hath the true Knowledge of Chri&s;t, if he &s;peaks, the Spirit of Chri&s;t &s;peaks in him; if he prays, it is through the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, through whom God alone is appea&s;ed and reconciled, and through whom they may receive a Ble&s;|&s;ing from God's Hands: But for Men to run on in their own Wills, and to do a thing becau&s;e they will do it, they had better &s;it &s;till; this doing in their own Wills, hath filled the World with a Sort of Chri&s;tians that want Acceptance with God, which is to be had alone through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and the Want of the Guidance of God's Holy Spirit, is the Mi&s;ery and Downfal of Chri&s;tianity in our Days.</P>
<P>Therefore it is our Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s to build upon that Foundation which God hath laid; no Wor&s;hip is plea&s;ing to God,

<P>Therefore, Friends, let every one that de|&s;ires to be religious, turn their Mind inward, wait for the Gift of God, which is e&s;&s;ential|ly pure, that never did con&s;ent to Evil, that never mixed with the Corruption of Na|ture, but bears witne&s;s to the Light, that will guide you and lead you, and conduct you, fir&s;t out of Sin, and then it will lead you into that Wor&s;hip and Religion, and the Performance of tho&s;e Things that are plea&s;ing to God. They that are come to this Wor&s;hip, they do not only know what the Lord requires of them, and when he re|quires it of them, but they are given up in|to the Hands of God; they pray, preach, exhort and live according to the Will of God.</P>
<P>It is hard for People in a carnal State to believe this; but you that are Believers, that are come to know the Gift of God in your|&s;elves, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of being ruled by him; you will believe us, for none el&s;e will believe us; let us preach to as many People

<P>You know there are a great many other Mini&s;ters, who&s;e Labours are to per&s;wade People to believe what they &s;ay: to lay down a Doctrine, and prove it by Scripture and Rea&s;on, and &s;et it home upon their Minds by &s;uch Te&s;timony as the Scripture affords, and hereupon they prevail upon the Minds and Judgments of People, to believe what they lay down.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to lay down a Po&s;ition and prove it, and convince People that it mu&s;t be according to Scripture; but when a Per&s;on is convinced of a Principle

If People would believe what we &s;ay, and ob&s;erve what Argument we bring for proving a Po&s;ition, they may be convinced of the Doc|trine of Truth, and come to a Profe&s;&s;ion of it, and yet be Strangers to it, till they come to love it in them&s;elves; if it were not for this, we would leave Preaching, if God had not given a Mea&s;ure and Manife&s;tation of the Spirit to every Man to profit withal: You have it in your&s;elves, we are but as Mo|nitors to you, to put you in Mind of it; you have &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s in the World, that you have not had lei&s;ure to take Notice of it.</P>
<P>A Man may have a rich Jewel, and be poor notwith&s;tanding, till he comes to know the Value of it.

<P>YOU have read and heard much con|cerning the Day of the Lord, as a great and notable Day; many of you are
<PB N="20" REF="013145_0150_0F8EC123F9D67520">
now living Witne&s;&s;es that the great, and no|table Day of the Lord is coming, in which the accompli&s;hment of great and nota|ble Things, the mighty Works of God, which have been prophe&s;ied of, may be law|fully expected. It is the Work of every Chri&s;tian to wait upon the Lord in the Light of this Day, and to be acquainted with the Works of the Lord, both inwardly and out|wardly; for the Day of the Lord is a Day of Power, and that Power of God worketh wonderful Things; and if we were not kept in the Light of that Day, the Lord may work great things, and we not know it; we &s;hall be looked upon as carele&s;s and neg|ligent Witne&s;&s;es of the Works of the Lord, as tho&s;e that do not regard them. If you would be faithful Witne&s;&s;es, you mu&s;t have regard to the Works of the Lord, and the Operation of his Hands. One that is mind|ed to be a faithful Witne&s;s, he will take Notice of what is &s;aid and done; you are called to be Witne&s;&s;es of the Works of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of his Doings; you mu&s;t &s;tand where you may hear, and &s;ee, and under&s;tand what the Lord is about to do at this Time.</P>
<P>In your Te&s;timony and Witne&s;s bearing, the greate&s;t Thing we have to expect in this Day of the Lord is, that God will &s;et up the Kingdom of his Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and unto
<PB N="21" REF="013145_0150_0F8EC123F9D67520">
this all the Prophets did bear witne&s;s in their Time, and now it is our Turn to bear wit|ne&s;s of it by &s;en&s;ible and living Experiences of the Accompli&s;hment of tho&s;e Things that they prophe&s;ied of, that the Lord will &s;et up the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, and bring down and lay wa&s;te the Kingdom of Antichri&s;t. This our Saviour taught his Di&s;ciples to pray for, &s;ixteen hundred years ago, that the Kingdom of God might come; and all the true Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t ever &s;ince have pray|ed for the coming of this Kingdom, and ma|ny of them have &s;een the coming of it, and rejoiced; and others have died in the Faith of it, and have been gathered into the King|dom of Heaven.</P>
<P>But, my Friends, that which chiefly con|cerns us at this Day, is to behold the King|dom of Chri&s;t, the eternal Son of God, with|in us, to go forward and pro&s;per; and the Kingdom of Antichri&s;t &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and de|&s;troyed, and utterly laid wa&s;te; and this is wrought two Ways, 1. Inwardly. 2. Out|wardly.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Inwardly, There is a greater Incli|nation in the Minds of People, to look more at the Operation of God's Power in this great Work outwardly, than to look at it inwardly, but unto that there mu&s;t be a daily Cro&s;s taken up, and it is my Bu&s;ine&s;s at this Time to tell you in the Name of the
<PB N="22" REF="013145_0151_0F8EC124F9D6ABD0">
Lord, that your Duty and mine is to turn our Minds to the Working of the Power of God in our&s;elves, and to &s;ee that other Kingdom of the Man of Sin weakened and brought down within us; then there is no Fear but he will carry on his Work outward|ly, and we &s;hall &s;ee as much of that Work as belongs to our Generation; but the great Matter and chief Concernment of you and me, is to &s;ee the Kingdom of God &s;et up within us, which &s;tands in Holine&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s: Our Bu&s;ine&s;s is to walk till we &s;ee the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of this Kingdom &s;et up within us in our Hearts and Souls, and to have a real change made.</P>
<P>We all know, and we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that wre have been &s;ubject to the Man of Sin, what&s;oever we are now. We have &s;een the Reign and Government, the Rage and Ty|ranny of the Wicked One that hath led us into Rebellion and Di&s;obedience to the Lord our Maker; how do we like that Govern|ment to be ruled by the Devil, and to be led Captive, and to be made to do his Will, and to rebel again&s;t God that gave us our Life, and our Breath, and our Being? How do we like that Government of Satan? I hope we do none of us like it. It was &s;o with me, and they that are under the tyrannical Government of Satan, have many Cries and Wi&s;hes in their Souls that they were freed
<PB N="23" REF="013145_0151_0F8EC124F9D6ABD0">
and delivered from it, and brought under the Government and Obedience of Chri&s;t Je&s;us: and they were able to &s;erve God as they ought to do, that they might be tran&s;|lated from the Kingdom of Sin and Satan, into the Kingdom of the ble&s;&s;ed and dearly beloved Sen of God.</P>
<P>This hath been the Cry of &s;ome ever &s;ince they have known the World; and I am per|&s;waded it is the Cry of many at this Day: I have good news to bring you; not that the Day of your Redemption draws nigh, but that it is come; the Day of Redemption is now come, and there are a great many ble&s;|&s;ing and glorifying the Name of God that they are redeemed, and delivered from the Bondage of Corruption, and have more Joy and Delight in the Service of God, that made them, than ever they had in the Service of the God of this World.</P>
<P>But may not &s;ome &s;ay, How &s;hall this great Work be wrought; for it is a great Work, and we verily think that nothing but an Almighty Power can effect it? For there are many in this A&s;&s;embly have been trying to no Purpo&s;e, and done what they could in their own Strength&punc; to deliver their own Souls from Death, and yet they find them&s;elves in Bondage &s;till; nay, they have called in the Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e that they thought to be &s;tronger than them&s;elves,

and all have failed, and they are yet weak and entangled, and they cannot find them|&s;elves at Liberty to &s;erve the Lord as they ought to do.</P>
<P>I am of this Mind, that nothing but the Almighty Power of God can do it; and when you come to my Experience, to know this as I have done, then I hope you will &s;eek after that, and you will &s;ee good Rea&s;on for it; and you will then come to this Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, If the Lord puts not forth his Al|mighty Power, I mu&s;t then peri&s;h, for there is no other Power can deliver me: When you come to know this, what mu&s;t you do? Why, you mu&s;t wait for the Revelation of that Power that will take you off from all Tru&s;t and Confidence that you have ever had in any Thing el&s;e; a Man that hath no|thing to tru&s;t to but the Almighty Power, and Mercy, and Goodne&s;s of God, he puts his whole Tru&s;t and Confidence therein, or el&s;e he knows he mu&s;t peri&s;h.</P>
<P>When a Man or Woman comes to this pa&s;s, that they have nothing to rely upon but the Lord, then they will meet together to wait upon the Lord: And this was the fir&s;t Ground or Motive of our &s;etting up Meetings; and I would to God that this was the u&s;e that every one would make of them that come to them, then they would be ju&s;tly and properly u&s;ed according to the

<P>What a Cry is there of our Bondage and Corruption, and of our being led Captive by
<PB N="26" REF="013145_0153_0F8EC125ED22F650">
our Lu&s;ts? We may hear &s;uch a Cry from one End of the Kingdom to the other: Peo|ple cry out of the Bondage of Corruption, and of their Subjection to Sin and Satan: I would they were in earne&s;t; there is not that Earne&s;tne&s;s and Reality in Men and Women that God looks for, and &s;o there comes nothing of it. There is no Redemp|tion, and no Deliverance, the Lord doth not hear them, though they come now a|days into his Pre&s;ence, to offer up their Prayers: I would have you to be in good earne&s;t, I wi&s;h well to you all; and it would be hard to &s;ay that you do not wi&s;h well to your&s;elves: Here lies your Welfare, that you find your&s;elves willing to be &s;ubject to the Power that made you; you have been &s;ub|ject doubtle&s;s to the Power that de&s;troyed you; that Power that never gave you Life and Breath, hath been in&s;trumental of your De&s;truction: The Power of the God of this World never did Men good, but de&s;troyed them, deceived them, and deprived them of their Lives.</P>
<P>Now if there was but a Willingne&s;s in e|very one of us, freely to give up our&s;elves to that Power that created us to obey his Will: I am &s;ure there is never a Man or Woman a|mong us &s;hall long be without the knowledge of it. If I am but willing to be &s;ubject to the Law of him that made me, it will not be long before he di&s;cover it to me, and reveal his

Power in me in the Glory and Excellency of it; that Power which is more able to pre|&s;erve me than all the Power of Men on Earth, or all the Power of the Devils in Hell is able to de&s;troy me. When the Lord &s;hall di&s;cover and reveal his Power in you, you will be willing to be &s;ubject to it.</P>
<P>But methinks the Sound and Noi&s;e of Fle&s;h and Blood grows loud here: I would be &s;ubject to God, but I would not have him cro&s;s mine intere&s;t, and deprive me of that I love and thir&s;t after: I would not have him imbitter my carnal Delights and Plea&s;ures, and undo me as to my Reputati|on in the World.</P>
<P>You may &s;ee whence this comes, that you would make a Bargain, and draw a Contract with the God of your Lives about the&s;e Things, this is a non&s;en&s;ical Thing; becau&s;e of all People in the World, you are a People that have had a Veneration for the Holy Scriptures, the Scriptures of Truth, and have been acquainted with them &s;o familiar|ly as with any Book in the World, wherein you find Articles drawn, long ago fixed and &s;ealed; and no new ones are to be drawn. If any one will be my Di&s;ciple, <HI>John</HI> or <HI>Tho|mas, James</HI> or <HI>Peter,</HI> or who&s;oever he be, he mu&s;t take up his Daily-Cro&s;s, and deny him&s;elf, and follow me.

Kind of Rea&s;oning and Con&s;ulting with Fle&s;h and Blood.</P>
<P>If you will become &s;piritual, and par|take of &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings and Benefits, I would advi&s;e you to turn from all Kind of Rea&s;onings that come from the Bit of Dark|ne&s;s, that hath thus far deceived you, and will ruin you for ever, if you hearken to them: For a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves new Go&s;pel-Terms no Man can make; and if any come to preach new Go&s;pel-Terms, count him a Deceiver; for there is no po&s;&s;ibility of being a Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, but by taking up a Cro&s;s daily, and denying our&s;elves, and follow|ing him as our Leader and Guide. To him I mu&s;t go, and go in no other Way, &s;peak|ing nothing, or doing nothing but what is holy and pure; he mu&s;t conduct me in my Walking, guide me in my Way, and ju&s;|tify me in it: This is to be a true Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he comes to adhere, and join to the Power of God revealed in his Soul, he &s;ees the coming of the Kingdom of God, he &s;ees it at a Di&s;tance, he &s;aith within him&s;elf, and makes this Conclu&s;ion, I will follow my Captain, I will become &s;ubject to the Kingdom of Chri&s;t. If I obey this divine Principle of the Grace of God, and the Go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t, I &s;hall be his Di&s;ciple. I read in his ble&s;&s;ed Book, <HI>That as many as are led by

the Spirit of God, are the Children of God.</HI> I am not to propo&s;e new Terms, but accept of the old Terms of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t: I &s;ee that the Kingdom of God is to be &s;et up, and the Kingdom of the Devil to be brought down in me; if I follow this divine Princi|ple, I &s;hould never follow the Devil more; if he would have me lye, I &s;hall refu&s;e, and &s;ay I cannot; if he would have me run into vain and corrupt Communication, and fool|i&s;h Je&s;ting, that will be a Bridle to me, that I cannot do it.</P>
<P>I &s;peak now to Per&s;ons that live under the Light of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and that are &s;ubdued by his Grace; I would &s;peak that which all the Logick in the World cannot overthrow, that which the mo&s;t cun|ning Logicjan, with all his Wit and Quirks, cannot refute and prove erronious. If a Man be led by the Spirit of God, he cannot lye; this is a common Cure for all Men; if I be led by the Spirit of Truth, and hearken to the Principle of Truth in my own Soul; this will cure and heal me of the Wounds and Maladies of my corrupt Nature, and &s;et me at Liberty from my old Ma&s;ter; I do not like his Service.</P>
<P>I hope if any of you like the Servitude and Bondage of Sin and Satan, you will de&s;ire Liberty before you die: Why do not you de&s;ire it now? It may be thou thinke&s;t

to enjoy a little Liberty and Reputation, and Plea&s;ure in Sin for many Years, for Six or Seven, Nine or Ten Years, and then break off from it, and repent and turn to God: How do&s;t thou know that thou ha&s;t Ten Days to live? It is of high Concern|ment to every one of us to wait for a Di&s;|covery of Go&s;pel-Liberty, and an Ability and Power in his Soul, to enable him to break off from the Servitude and Bondage of Sin and Satan, that he hath &s;o long lived under; and to wait upon God with Patience for the &s;etting his Soul at Liberty, and &s;et|ting up the Kingdom of Chri&s;t within him, and pulling down the Kingdom of Satan, that he may be brought into the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, that con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>Peace and Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> The&s;e are the Things that follow one another; when Righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;et up in me, I &s;hall not be di&s;turbed, I &s;hall have Peace; and if I have Peace I &s;hall have joy, and this joy is in the Holy Gho&s;t the Apo&s;tle &s;aith the Kingdom of God con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>Now that every one might be per&s;waded that God hath given a Mea&s;ure of his Grace to them, as well as to other Folks: Let them con&s;ider and &s;ay within them&s;elves, God hath not &s;hut me out of the Number of his People: He hath knocked at the Door of my Heart, to bring me to Repentance, he hath
<PB N="31" REF="013145_0155_0F8EC126B11CEBF8">
waited upon me &s;o long, &s;urely he hath a Mind to &s;ave me: Would he call upon me, but that he intends I &s;hould repent and turn to him?</P>
<P>But where is the Power? You will &s;ay knocking at the Door of the Heart, and Checks of Con&s;cience, we under&s;tand them; but we under&s;tand not where the Power is, to be comformable to the Will of God.</P>
<P>People will never under&s;tand it while they are in the Kingdom of Satan, and under the Power of the Prince of Darkne&s;s; the A|po&s;tle tells us, <HI>That the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them that believe not le&s;t the Light of the Glorious Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who is the Image of God, &s;hould &s;hine upon them.</HI> If Men &s;aw the Beauty of the Go&s;pel, they would run after it, and embrace it; there|fore the Devil blinds their Minds, that they &s;hould not &s;ee the Beauty and Amiablene&s;s of the Go&s;pel, and like the Terms of it: He hath the Rule and Government of the Chil|dren of Di&s;obedience. So long as I live in Subjection to that devili&s;h helli&s;h Power, which leads me forth into Sin: I &s;hall be a Stranger to God's Power, that would enable me to break off from it.</P>
<P>You never read in Scripture of any that ever came to be &s;aved by the Power of God, but there was Faith mixed with it, that came to join with that Power of God, Our Sa|iour
<PB N="32" REF="013145_0156_0F8EC1278F569ED8">
&s;aid to the impotent Man, <HI>Thy Faith hath made the whole;</HI> thy Faith joining with that Power of God. <HI>We &s;hall be made &s;trong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might,</HI> and be able to with&s;tand Temptations.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Soul of Man joins with the Grace of God, he doth for&s;ake the Service of his old Ma&s;ter and Governor, Sin &s;hall no longer have Dominion over him; though he may meet with the &s;ame Temptation, it &s;hall not have the &s;ame Power over him, but he will be enabled, by the Grace of God to with&s;tand it, and overcome it. If you a&s;k &s;uch a Man, how it is that he over|comes that Temptation that formerly pre|vailed over him; he will tell you, I have now an Helper, I am now joined to the Grace of God in my Soul, therefore do I with&s;tand Temptations, and have Power over them. Thus comes the Kingdom of Chri&s;t to be &s;et up in the Soul, and this is that which will fit and prepare us for the everla&s;ting King|dom of God: They that do wait upon God, &s;hall &s;ee this Work wrought inwardly in them, they know more by Faith than they can &s;ee by Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>I know and am certain, that the Power the Devil hath in the World, &s;hall be bro|ken down, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be ex|alted, and Ju&s;tice and Equity &s;hall prevail in the Nations. I &s;hall not perhaps live to

<P>The Church of God from one Generation to another, have their Mea&s;ure and Degree of Service, and bear their proper Te&s;timo|ny, and leave the re&s;t to &s;ucceeding Genera|tions: It concerns us in our Generation to &s;ee a Change made inwardly in our Souls, and the Kingdom of Chri&s;t &s;et up within us, and the Kingdom of Satan brought down in our&s;elves. This doth not concern my Son or Grand&s;on only, but it concerns me, and when they grow up to mature Age, in their Time it will concern them. Therefore that which is mo&s;t profitable to us, is, that we have &s;uch a Station, and &s;tand in &s;uch a Place in our Time, where we may &s;ee the Work of God carried on.</P>
<P>I have con&s;idered many a Time, that there are many brave Men and Women in this Age, that might have been eminent Wit|ne&s;&s;es of God in this World, and borne their Te&s;timony to his Truth, but their Faith

But I would hope better Things of you, Things that accompany Salvation and that he that hath begun a good Work in you will carry it on to Perfection; that living Prai&s;es and joyful Thank&s;givings may be rendered to him who alone worthy, who is God over all, ble&s;&s;ed for ever; to whom be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

The Apo&s;tle alludes to this Bapti&s;m, for he &s;peaks in a Figure of the <HI>Eight Per&s;ons that were &s;aved in</HI> Noah's <HI>Ark;</HI> then he brings down the

Allegory to Chri&s;tian Bapti&s;m, not only the Bapti&s;m of <HI>John,</HI> the Fore-runner of Chri&s;t, that preached of Chri&s;t, but to the Chri&s;tian Bapti&s;m it&s;elf; <HI>By the like Figure whereof Bap|ti&s;m now &s;aveth us,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>not the putting away of the Filth of the Fle&s;h, but the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience.</HI> What doth he mean by Bapti&s;m &s;aving us?

commit a Sin while I live, it is not this &s;imply in it&s;elf that will make me have the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience in the Sight of God; for there remains the Guilt of Sin contracted in the Days of Unbelief, which is a Bar and Hindrance that none can ap|proach the Holy God but in the Attonement and Salvation that comes by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for all that believe and obey the Go&s;pel are accepted in Chri&s;t, and upon the Account of Chri&s;t's precious Blood, that clean&s;eth us from all Sin and Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. Whom doth it clean&s;e? Tho&s;e only that for&s;ake their Sins, and by his Power are brought to a holy Life; they by the Virtue of his Power, and the Clean&s;ing of his Blood, come to have their former Sins removed from them, as far as the Ea&s;t is from the We&s;t.</P>

<P>So it is now with every one that cometh to believe the Truth, and make a Profe&s;&s;ion of it: there is a Way ca&s;t up, and there is a Door opened for Salvation; but the grand Que&s;tion that every one ought to enquire a|bout, and put to them&s;elves, is, What Pro|gre&s;s they have made this Way?

again&s;t it; we have <HI>Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks;</HI> if I be within the&s;e Walls, Salva|tion is round about me; if I am got into this eternal Bulwark, I am &s;afe from the Devil and his In&s;truments; here is a Bul|wark to be relied upon.</P>
<P>Many wonder we differ with them in &s;ome Opinions; we have that Confidence in this Bulwark, that we de&s;ire not another; God will la&s;t and abide for ever, &s;o will this Bul|wark; all the Care that I take, and all the Care that you &s;hould take, is to keep with|in the&s;e Walls: Do not &s;ally out, if you go out, the Devil is watching, and <HI>&s;eeking con|tinually whom he may devour;</HI> he will catch &s;traglers; if that People will go out for Pro|fit, or for Plea&s;ure, or Intere&s;t, the Devil will catch them: What, &s;uch People talk of Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks? the De|vil hath got them in his Snare, and they are caught in Drunkenne&s;s, Uncleanne&s;s and o|ther Sins; the Rea&s;on is, they have gone out of their Bulwark, they have &s;allied out of their Walls, for the Devil could never have fetched them out.</P>

<P>I remember a notable Saying of the A|po&s;tle, which hath a great Empha&s;is in it, and a great Deal of Doctrine, he writeth to the Church after they were become a Peo|ple of Profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, <HI>Take heed le&s;t you come to be beguiled by the Serpent, as he be|guiled Eve;</HI> he did not &s;peak of <HI>Jezabel,</HI> a wicked Woman; but he &s;poke of <HI>Eve,</HI> a good Woman <HI>created after the Image of God, in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s:</HI> They were come to a Life of Sanctification, to a Life <HI>that was hidden from Ages and Generations;</HI> You mu&s;t look to your&s;elves, and look upon your&s;elves as in the State of your Mother <HI>Eve,</HI> a Woman brought forth in Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and Holine&s;s, that might have &s;tood in that Primitive State, notwith&s;tanding all the Subtilty of all the Serpents in the World;

but letting her Ear hearken to this Old Ser|pent, &s;he was beguiled; there grew up a Con&s;ultation in her rea&s;oning Part; it may be &s;o as he &s;aith, I will try.</P>
<P>So I &s;ay to you that are come to a State of Sanctification, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure to know the clean&s;ing Power of God, and that you have not believed in it in vain, but it hath effectually wrought &s;ome Change and Alteration in you, and is &s;till carrying on the Work of your Salvation: Many Temp|tations will attend you, and many Snares will be laid in your Way, but God hath pre|&s;erved you to this Day: I know the Devil's Wiles and Temptations are manifold; they are fitted to every one's Inclinations, fitted to every Opportunity, and to every Occa&s;ion in this World; Men are tryed every Way by the Tempter, to &s;ee which Way he may en&s;nare them; he tries every Way to <HI>en&s;nare</HI> and entangle <HI>the &s;imple,</HI> that he may turn them to the right hand or to the left, that their Souls may be de&s;troyed and peri&s;h.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;peak to you by a more empha|tical Word, by a more familiar Exhortation than this, <HI>Take heed you be not beguiled as Eve was:</HI> many will be tempted as &s;he was; but I would not have you do as &s;he did, and yield to the Temptation: Take heed that you do not defile your&s;elves, but <HI>keep your Garments white;</HI> you that have been wa&s;hed

<P><PB REF="013145_0171_0F8EC135009BA7A8" MS="y">THERE is a divine Philo&s;ophy and there is al&s;o a fal&s;e Philo&s;ophy.

When this Light breaks in upon the Soul, &s;he, as it were, &s;oars above the Re|gions of Sen&s;e; a new World opening to her View: She beholds her original Dignity, feels her Immorta|lity, and &s;eems, in &s;ome Sort, to have already entered upon the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of it, through a Faith more lu|minous than the brightne&s;s of the Sun, and a Love &s;tronger than Death.
