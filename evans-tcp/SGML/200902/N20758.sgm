<HEAD>SPEECH OF MR. MADISON, IN CONGRESS, JANUARY 14, 1794.</HEAD>
<P>HE began by ob&s;erving, that he had expected, from what was intimated ye&s;terday, the &s;equel of what was then &s;aid again&s;t the re&s;olutions before the commit|tee; but as there was a &s;ilence in that quarter, and no other member has ri&s;en on either &s;ide of the que&s;tion, he him&s;elf would reque&s;t the attention of the committee.</P>
<P>It had been much pre&s;&s;ed, that in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this &s;ubject, it &s;hould be viewed in its commercial re|lations only. He was perfectly willing to meet every object that could be urged on that ground: But as he conceived it impo&s;&s;ible to do full ju&s;tice to the intere&s;ts of the United States, without taking &s;ome collateral con&s;iderations into view; he &s;hould be obliged, in the cour&s;e of his remarks, to point at the political di&s;po&s;iti|on and conduct of &s;ome of the nations of Europe to|wards this country.</P>
<P>The propo&s;itions immediately before the committee, turned on the que&s;tion, whether any thing ought to be done at this time, in the way of commercial regulations, towards vindicating and advancing our national intere&s;ts. Perhaps it might be made a que&s;tion with &s;ome, whe|ther, in any ca&s;e, legi&s;lative regulations of commerce were con&s;i&s;tent with its nature and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>He profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to be a friend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the theory which gives to indu&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;e, under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of individual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the guidan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> individual &s;agacity. He was per&s;uaded, that it would be happy for all nations, if the barriers erected by prejudice, by
<PB N="4" REF="027258_0003_0FD3F2A677547D60">
avarice, and by de&s;poti&s;m, were broken down, and a free intercour&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed among them. Yet to this, as to all other general rules, there might be exceptions: And the rule it&s;elf required, what did not exi&s;t, that it &s;hould be general.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this ob&s;ervation, he referred to the navi|gation act of Great Britain, which, not being counter|balanced by any &s;imilar acts on the part of rival nations, had &s;ecured to Great Britain no le&s;s than <HI>eleven-twelfths</HI> of the &s;hipping and &s;eamen employed in her trade. It is &s;tated, that in 1660, when the Briti&s;h act pa&s;&s;ed, the foreign tonnage was to the Briti&s;h as one to four: In 1700, le&s;s than one to &s;ix: In 1725, as one to nine|teen: In 1750, as one to twelve: In 1774, nearly the &s;ame. At the commencement of the period, the ton|nage was but 95,266 tons: At the end of it, 1,136,162.</P>
<P>As another illu&s;tration, he mentioned the ca&s;e where two countries happened to be in &s;uch a relation to each other, that the one, by di&s;couraging the manufactures of the other, might not only invigorate its own, but tran&s;plant the manufacturers them&s;elves. Here the gain would be a clear one; and the effect evidently con&s;i&s;tent with the principle of the theory.</P>
<P>To allow trade to regulate it&s;elf, is not, therefore, to be admitted as a maxim <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> &s;ound. Our own experience has taught us, that, in certain ca&s;es, it is the &s;ame thing with allowing one nation to regulate it for another. Were the United States, in fact, in com|mercial intercour&s;e with one nation only, and to oppo&s;e no re&s;trictions whatever to a &s;y&s;tem of foreign re&s;tric|tions, they would, of nece&s;&s;ity, be deprived of all &s;hare in the carriage, although their ve&s;&s;els might be able to do it cheape&s;t; as well as of the only re&s;ources for de|fence on that &s;ide, where they mu&s;t always be mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. A &s;mall burden only in foreign ports on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> ve&s;&s;els, and a perfect equality of foreign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in our own po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> would gradually banish the latter altogether.</P>
<P>This subject, as had been remarked on a former oc|ca&s;ion, was not a novel one: It was co-eval with our political birth, and has at all times exerci&s;ed the thoughts
<PB N="5" REF="027258_0004_0FD3F2ABDE476760">
of reflecting citizens. As early as the year &s;ucceeding the peace, the effect of the foreign policy, which began to be felt in our trade and navigation, excited univer&s;al attention and inquietude. The fir&s;t effort thought of, was an application of Congre&s;s to the &s;tates for a grant of power, for a limited time, to regulate our foreign commerce; with a view, to controul the influence of unfavorable regulations in &s;ome ca&s;es, and to conciliate an exten&s;ion of favorable ones in others. From &s;ome circum&s;tances then incident to our &s;ituation, and par|ticularly from a radical vice in the then political &s;y&s;tem of the United States, the experiment did not take ef|fect.</P>
<P>The &s;tates next endeavored to effect their purpo&s;e by &s;eparate, but concurrent, regulations. Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts opened a corre&s;pondence with Virginia and other &s;tates, in order to bring about the plan. Here again the effort was abortive.</P>
<P>Out of this experience, grew the mea&s;ures which terminated in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a government com|petent to the regulation of our commercial interests, and the vindication of our commercial rights.</P>
<P>As the&s;e were the fir&s;t objects of the people in the &s;teps taken for e&s;tabli&s;hing the pre&s;ent government, they were univer&s;ally expected to be among the fir&s;t fruits of its operation. In this expectation, the public were di&s;appointed. An attempt was made in different forms, and received the repeated &s;anction of this, branch of the legi&s;lature, but they expired in the &s;enate: Not, in|deed, as was alledged, from a di&s;like to the attempt al|together but the modifications given to it. It has not appeared, however, that it was ever renewed in a dif|ferent form in that hou&s;e; and for &s;ome time it has been allowed to &s;leep in both.</P>
<P>If the rea&s;ons which originally prevailed against mea|&s;ures &s;uch as tho&s;e now propo&s;ed, had weight in them, they can no longer furni&s;h a pretext for oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>When the &s;ubject was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t Congre&s;s at New-York, it was &s;aid, that we ought to try the effect of a generous policy towards Great Britain; that we ought to give time for negociating a treaty of com|merce;
<PB N="6" REF="027258_0005_0FD3F2AD50A7E698">
that we ought to await the clo&s;e of negociations for explaining and executing the treaty of peace. We have now waited a term of more than four years. The treaty of peace remains unexecuted on her part; though all pretext for delay has been removed by the &s;teps taken on ours. No treaty of commerce is either in train, or in pro&s;pect. In&s;tead of relaxations in former articles complained of, we &s;uffer new and aggravated violations of our rights.</P>
<P>In the view which he took of the &s;ubject, he called the attention of the committee particularly to the &s;ubject of navigation, of manufactures, and of the di&s;crimina|tion propo&s;ed in the motion, between &s;ome nations and others.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of navigation, he ob&s;erved, that we were prohibited by the Briti&s;h laws from carrying to Great Britain the produce of other countries from their ports, or our own produce from the ports of other coun|tries, or the produce of other countries from our own ports; or to &s;end our own produce from our own or other ports in the ve&s;&s;els of other countries. This la&s;t re&s;triction was, he ob&s;erved, felt by the United States at the pre&s;ent moment. It was, indeed, the practice of Great Britain &s;ometimes to relax her navigation act &s;o far, in time of war, as to permit to neutral ve&s;&s;els a circuitous carriage; but as yet the act was in full force again&s;t the u&s;e of them for tran&s;porting the produce of the United States.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the laws of the United States al|lowed Great Britain to bring into their ports, any thing &s;he might plea&s;e, from her own or from other ports; and in her own or in other ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>In the trade between the United States and the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies, the ve&s;&s;els of the former were under an ab&s;olute prohibition; whil&s;t Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els in that trade enjoyed all the privileges granted to other, even the mo&s;t favored nations in their trade with us. The inequality in this ca&s;e was the more &s;triking, as it was evident, that the We&s;t-Indies were dependant on the United States for the &s;upplies e&s;&s;ential to them, and that the circum&s;tances which &s;ecured to the United States this
<PB N="7" REF="027258_0006_0FD3F2AFD8EA2C80">
advantage, enabled their ve&s;&s;els to tran&s;port the &s;upplies on far better terms than could be done by Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate the policy requi&s;ite in our commercial intercour&s;e with other nations, he pre&s;ented a com|parative view of the American and foreign tonnage em|ployed in the re&s;pective branches of it, from which it appeared, that the foreign &s;tood to the American as follows:
<TABLE>

</TABLE></P>
<P>It re&s;ults from the&s;e facts, that in proportion as the trade might be dimini&s;hed with Great Britain, and in|crea&s;ed with other nations, would be the probable in|crea&s;e of the American tonnage. It appeared, for ex|ample, that as the trade might pa&s;s from Briti&s;h channels into tho&s;e of France, it would augment our tonnage at the rate of ten to one.</P>
<P>The above calculation, he &s;aid, had been made out on the documents of 1790, and on the amount of the tonnage <HI>entered</HI> in the &s;everal ports. A document, &s;tating the amounts of the <HI>actual</HI> tonnage in the Ameri|can trade, had been ju&s;t reported to that hou&s;e. If this, which was liable to &s;ome remarks that might hereafter be made, was to be &s;ub&s;tituted, it afforded another cal|culation, dimini&s;hing the exce&s;s in favor of Great Britain, but augmenting it in favor of the United States in mo&s;t of the other in&s;tances.</P>
<P>According to this calculation, the foreign to the American tonnage might be &s;tated as follows:

Such a di&s;proportion, taking even the reduced one, in the navigation with Great Britain, was the more mortifying, when the nature and amount of our exports are con&s;idered. Our exports are not only for the mo&s;t part, either immediately nece&s;&s;aries of life, or ultimate|ly as nece&s;&s;aries to manufactures, nece&s;&s;aries of employ|ment and life to manufacturers, and mu&s;t thence com|mand a &s;ure market wherever they are received at all: But the peculiar bulkine&s;s of them furni&s;hes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> advant|age over the exports of every other country; and parti|cularly over tho&s;e of Great Britain. If &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> advant|age belonged to that nation, the policy which governs her navigation laws, would probably have given the ex|clu&s;ive carriage to her own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ttoms. It is equally in our power, if &s;o &s;elfi&s;h a principle &s;hould be forced up|on us, to &s;ecure to our bottoms the &s;ame monopoly; leaving to other nations with which we trade, the like exclu&s;ive carriage of their exports. The regulation would, to be &s;ure be mutually inconvenient; and, by forcing the ve&s;&s;els of each party to return empty from foreign markets, be &s;o far a tax on the intercour&s;e.&mdash; This effect, however, did not di&s;prove the power in general which the character of our exports gave us, over the carriage of them, nor le&s;&s;en the argument drawn from it. Examine it in relation to Great Britain. The bulk of her exports to us, compared with that of ours to her, is as nothing. An incon&s;iderable quantity of &s;hipping would &s;uffice for hers, whil&s;t ours can load about 222,000 tons: Including the articles &s;he exports from the We&s;t-Indies to this country, they bear no pro|portion to ours. Yet in the entire trade between the United States and the Briti&s;h dominions, her tonnage is to that of the United States as 156,000, employing 9360 &s;eamen, to 66,000, employing 3690 &s;eamen. Were a rigid exertion of our right to take place, it would ex|tend our tonnage to 222,000, and leave to Great Britain employment for much le&s;s than the actual &s;hare now enjoyed by the United States. It could not be wi&s;hed to pu&s;h matters to this extremity. It &s;hewed, however, the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">qual and unfavorable footing on which the carrying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the great resource of our &s;afety and re&s;|pectability,
<PB N="9" REF="027258_0008_0FD3F2B281B3DA20">
was placed by foreign regulations, and the rea&s;onablene&s;s of peaceable attempts to meliorate it. We might at lea&s;t, in availing our&s;elves of the merit of our exports, contend for &s;uch regulations as would rever&s;e the proportion, and give the United States the 156,000 tonnage, and 9360 &s;eamen, in&s;tead of the 66,000 ton|nage and 3690 &s;eamen.</P>
<P>He here adverted to the di&s;count of ten of ten per cent. on the duties paid by goods imported in American bottoms; remarking, thai it was not founded on the true policy of encouraging our &s;hipping. It was not the <HI>imports,</HI> but <HI>exports,</HI> that regulated the quantity of tonnage.&mdash; What was imported in American ve&s;&s;ls, which would otherwi&s;e return empty, was, no doubt, a benefit to the American merchant, but could &s;lightly only, if at all, increa&s;e the ma&s;s of our tonnage. The way to effect this, was to &s;ecure <HI>exportations</HI> to American bot|toms.</P>
<P>Proceeding to the &s;ubject of manufactures, he ob&s;erv|ed, that it pre&s;ented no compen&s;ations for the inequali|ties in the principles and effects of the navigation &s;y&s;|tem.</P>
<P>We con&s;ume Briti&s;h manufactures to double the amount of what Britain takes from us; and <HI>quadruple</HI> the amount of what &s;he actually <HI>con&s;umes.</HI></P>
<P>We take every thing after it has undergone all the profitable labor that can be be&s;towed on it: She receives in return, raw materials, the food of her indu&s;try.</P>
<P>We &s;end nece&s;&s;aries te her: She &s;ends &s;uperfluities to us.</P>
<P>We admit <HI>every thing</HI> &s;he plea&s;ed to &s;end us, whe|ther of her own or alien production. She refu&s;es not only our manufactures, but the articles we wi&s;h mo&s;t to &s;end her; our wheat and flour, our fi&s;h, and our &s;alted provi&s;ions. The&s;e con&s;titute our be&s;t &s;taples for exportation, as her manufactures con&s;titute hers.</P>
<P>It appeared by an authentic document he had exam|ined, that of the <HI>manufactured</HI> articles imported in 1790, amounting to 15,295,638 dollars, 97 cents. we received from and <HI>through</HI> Great Britain, 13,965,464 dollars, 95 cents.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="027258_0009_0FD3F2B3FB6907B8">
During the &s;ame year, the <HI>manufactures</HI> imported from France, the next great commercial country, and con&s;uming more of our produce than Great-Britain, amounted to no more than 155,136 dolars, and 63 cents.</P>

<P>This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">normous balance to Great Britain is on the <HI>ex|ports</HI> to her. On her <HI>conjumption,</HI> the balance is &s;till greater, amounting to nine or ten millions; to which again is to be added, her profits on the re-exports in a manufactured and raw &s;tate.</P>
<P>It might be &s;aid, that an unfavorable balance was no proof of an unfovarable trade; that the only important balance was the ultimate one on our aggregate com|merce.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> there was much truth in this general doctrine, was admitted; at the &s;ame time it was equally certain, that there were exceptions to it, &s;ome of which were con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to be applicable to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s;ituation of the United States.</P>
<P>But whether the doctrine was ju&s;t or not, as applied to the United States, it was well known, that the rea|&s;oning and practice of other countries were governed by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary doctrine.

<P>As to the di&s;erimination propo&s;ed between nations having, and not having, commercial treaties with us, the principle was embraced by the laws of mo&s;t, if not all, the &s;tates, while the regulation of trade was in their hands.</P>

<P>It tends, as a conciliatory preference, to procure bet|ter treaties from tho&s;e who have not refu&s;ed them.</P>
<P>It was a prudent con&s;ideration, in di&s;pen&s;ing com|mercial advantages, to favor rather tho&s;e who&s;e friend|&s;hip and &s;upport may be expected in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, than tho&s;e who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition wore a contrary a&s;pect.&mdash; He did not wi&s;h to enter at pre&s;ent, nor at all, if un|nece&s;&s;ary, into a di&s;play of the unfriendly features which marked the policy of Great Britain towards the United States, He &s;hould be content to lay a&s;ide, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, the &s;ubject of the Indians, the Algerines, the &s;poliations, &amp;c. but he could not forbear remarking generally, that if that, or any other nation, were known to bear us a &s;ettled ill-will, nothing could be more im|politic, than to fo&s;ter re&s;ources which would be more likely to be turned again&s;t us, than exerted in our favour.</P>

But the gentleman added nothing to alleviate the misfortune, when he advi&s;ed us to make no efforts for putting an end to it.

A general bankruptcy, which was a po&s;&s;ible event, in a nation with which we were &s;o connected, would reverberate upon us with a mo&s;t dreadful &s;hock. A partial bank|ruptcy had actually and lately taken place; and was &s;everely felt in our commerce. War is a common event particularly to Great-Britain, and involves us in the embarra&s;&s;ments it brings on her commerce, whil&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s is &s;o di&s;proportionately interwoven with it, Add, the influence that may be conveyed into the public councils by a nation directing the cour&s;e of our trade by her capital, and holding &s;o great a &s;hare in our pec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iniary in&s;titutions; and the effect that may &s;in|ally, en&s;ue on our ta&s;te, our manners, and our form of government it&s;elf.</P>
<P>If the que&s;tion be a&s;ked, what might be the con&s;e|quence of counter-efforts, and whether this attempt to vindicate our public intere&s;ts would not produce them? His an&s;wer was, that he did not in the lea&s;t apprehend &s;uch a con&s;equence, as well becau&s;e the mea&s;ure af|forded no pretext, being &s;hort of what was already done by Great-Britain in her commercial &s;y&s;tem, as be|cau&s;e &s;he would be the greate&s;t &s;ufferer from a &s;tagna|tion of the trade, between thtwo countries it we &s;hould force on &s;uch a cri&s;is.</P>
<P>Her merchants would feel it. Her navigation would feel it. Her manufacturers would feel it. Her We&s;t-|Indies would be ruined by it. Her revenue would deep|ly feel it. And her government would feel it thro every nerve of its operations. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o &s;hould &s;uffer in &s;ome re&s;pect, but in a le&s;s degree; and, if the virtue and temper of our fellow citizens were not mi&s;taken, the experiment would find in them a far greater readi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s to bear it. It was clear to him, therefore, that if Great-Britain &s;hould, contrary to all the rules of pro|bability, &s;top the commerce between the two countries, the i&s;&s;ue would be a compleat triumph to the United States.</P>
<P>He dwelt particularly on the dependance of Briti&s;h manufacturers on the market of the United States. He
<PB N="13" REF="027258_0012_0FD3F2BA0243ECF0">
referred to a paper in Ander&s;on's hi&s;tory of commerce, which &s;tates the amount of Briti&s;h manufactures at &pound; 51,310,000 &s;terling, and the number of &s;ouls em|ployed in, and &s;upported by them, at 5,250,000. Supp|po&s;ing the United states to con&s;ume two and a half mil|lions of Briti&s;h manufactures, which is a moderate e&s;ti|mate, the lo&s;s of their market would deprive of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence 250,000 &s;ouls. Add 50,000 who depend for em|ployment on our raw materials. Here are 300,000 &s;ouls, who live by our cu&s;tom. Let them be driven to poverty and de&s;pair by acts of their own govern|ment, and what would be the con&s;equence? Mo&s;t pro|blably an acqui&s;ition of &s;o many u&s;eful citizens to the United States, which form the natural a&s;ylum again&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Europe. But whether they &s;hould re|main in di&s;content and wretchedne&s;s in their own country, or &s;eek their fortunes in another, the evil would be felt by the Briti&s;h government as equally great, and be avoided with equal caution.</P>
<P>It might be regarded be ob&s;erved, as a general rule, that where one nation con&s;umed the nece&s;&s;aries of life produced by another, the con&s;uming nation was depen|dant on the producing o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. On the other hand, where the co&s;umption con&s;i&s;ted of &s;uperflukies, the produc|ing nation was dependant on the con&s;uming one. The United States were in the fortunate &s;ituation of enjoy|ing both the&s;e advantages over Great-Britain. They &s;upply a part of her dominions with the nece&s;&s;aries of life. They con&s;ume &s;uperfluities which give bread to her people in another part. Great Britain therefore is under a double dependance on the commerce of the United States. She depends on them for what &s;he her|&s;elf con&s;umes: &s;he depends on them for what they con|&s;ume.</P>
<P>In proportion as a nation manufactures luxuries mu&s;t be its di&s;advantage in conte&s;ts of every &s;ort with its cu&s;tomers. The rea&s;on is obvious. What is luxury to the con&s;umer is a nece&s;&s;ary to the manufacturer. By changing a fa&s;hion, or di&s;appointing a fancy only, bread may be taken from the mouths of thou&s;ands who&s;e indu&s;try is devoted to the gratifications of artifi|cial wants.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="027258_0013_0FD3F2BDEB037980">He mentioned the ca&s;e of a petition from a great bo|dy of buckle makers pre&s;ented a few years ago to the prince of Wales, complaining of the u&s;e of &s;trings in|&s;tead of buckles in the &s;hoes, and &s;upplicating his roy|al highne&s;s as giving the law to fa&s;hions, to &s;ave them from want and mi&s;ery, by di&s;continuing the new one. It was not, he ob&s;erved, the prince who petitioned the manufacturers to continue to make the buckles, but the manufacturers who petitioned their cu&s;tomer to buy them. The relation was &s;imilar between the Ameri|can cu&s;tomers and the Briti&s;h manufacturers. And if a law were to pa&s;s for putting a &s;top to the life of their &s;uperfluities, or a &s;top were otherwi&s;e to be put to it, it would quickly be &s;een from which the di&s;tre&s;s and &s;uplications would flow.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e that Great Britain received from us alone the whole of the nece&s;&s;aries &s;he con&s;umes; and that our market alone took off the luxuries with which &s;he paid for them. Here the dependence would be compleate; and we might impo&s;e whatever terms we plea&s;e on the exchange.

<P>The We&s;t-Indies however are a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> example o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> com|pleat dependence. They cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without our food. They cannot flouri&s;h without our lumber, and our u&s;e of their ruin.

And yet the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Smith) had con&s;idered it as a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or that we were allowed to &s;end our provi&s;ions in Briti&s;h bottomsand in the&s;e on|ly, to the We&s;t-Indies. The favor reduced to plain lan|guage in the mouth of their planters, would run thus:&mdash; We will agree to buy your provi&s;ions rather than &s;tarve, and let you have our rum, which we can &s;ell no where|el&s;e; but we re&s;erve out of this indulgence a monopoly of the carriage to Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>With regard to revenue, the Briti&s;h re&s;ources were extremely exhau&s;ted in compari&s;on with tho&s;e of the United States.</P>
<P>The people of Great-Britain were taxed at the rate of 40&s;. a head: the people of the United States at not more than 6&s;. a head: le&s;s than one-&s;ixth of the Briti&s;h tax.</P>
<P>As the price of labor which pays the tax is double in the United States, to what it is in Great-Britain, the burden on American citizens is le&s;s than one-twelfth of the burden on Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>It is true indeed that Britain alone does not bear the whole burden. She levies indirect taxes on her We&s;t-Indies and on her Ea&s;t-Indies; and derives from an ac|quie&s;ence in her monopolizing regulations, an imper|ceptible tribute from the whole commercial world.</P>
<P>Still however the difference of burden in the two countries is immen&s;e.</P>
<P>Britain has moreover great arrears of unfunded debts. She is threatened with defects in her revenue even at this time. She is engaged in an expen&s;ive war. And &s;he rai&s;es the &s;upplies for it on the mo&s;t expen|&s;ive terms.</P>
<P>Add to the whole that her population is &s;tationary if not dimini&s;hing, whil&s;t that of the United States is in a cour&s;e of increa&s;e beyond example.</P>
<P>Should it &s;till be a&s;ked whether the impo&s;t might not be affected and how a deficiency could be &s;upplied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he thought &s;ufficient an&s;wers might be given.</P>
<P>He took for granted that the articles &s;ubjected to the additional duties would continue to come according to the demand for them: And believed if the duties were
<PB N="16" REF="027258_0015_0FD3F2C174907390">
prudently adju&s;ted, the increa&s;e of the duties would ba|lance the decrea&s;e of importation.</P>
<P>Our country is able to import, and probably will im|port, in proportion to our exports. Our exports amount, &s;ay to, twenty millions of dollars. If we im|port le&s;s from one country we &s;hall import more from another. If we import le&s;s of &s;ome things we &s;hall im|port more of other things: and according to our im|ports will be our revenue.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e Great-Britain to make the ra&s;h and impro|bable experiment of prohibiting all commerce with the United States: She does not con&s;ume more than one-fourth of our exports; and we derive perhaps nearly half our revenue from the productions of other coun|tries. In this point of view we &s;hould at the wor&s;t have three-fourths of our exports to pay for our reduced im|ports; and con&s;equently a balance of about five mil|lions of &s;pecie flowing into our country. The faculty which this would give to operations of revenue, togeth|er with the con&s;ideration that the labor employed on one fourth of our ordinary exports, would be employed for internal purpo&s;es, might a&s;&s;ure us that a judicious gov|ernment would ea&s;ily be able to provide the means of &s;upplying the deficiency of impo&s;t.</P>
<P>But it was &s;uperfluous to enter into calculations of this &s;ort. He recurred to the utter improbability that &s;uch a contingency &s;hould happen. He was fully per&s;uaded, that the re&s;olutions, if agreed to, would not impair the revenue.</P>
<P>It is objected, that Spain and Portugal, who are good cu&s;tomers to us, and the latter particularly friendly, having no commercial treaty with us, will come with|in the operation of the re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>Several an&s;wers mabe given to this objection.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. They do not manufacture the articles in que&s;tion &s;o as to be &s;en&s;ibly affected.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They employ but little tonnage in our trade: Spain 2,689 tons only; Portugal 2,340 tons only: They are &s;uppo&s;ed to be little anxious to increa&s;e the foreign branches of their carrying trade, being content with the internal trade carried on with their own dominions. As
<PB N="17" REF="027258_0016_0FD3F2C312AE41D0">
they have no navigation act within the purview of the re&s;olutions, they would not be expo&s;ed to the retaliating clau&s;es on that &s;ubject.</ITEM>

<P>It is &s;aid that Great-Britain treats the United States as wll as &s;he treats other nations, and therefore they ought to be &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>If other nations were willing to bear unequal regu|lations, or unable to vindicate their rights, it was no example for us.</P>
<P>But is it true that the &s;ame degree of reciprocity &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts between the United States and Great-Britain, as between Great-Britain and other countries? He did not admit this to be the ca&s;e. Where treaties exi&s;ted, they &s;tipulated in many in&s;tances, mutual and equal condi|tions of intercour&s;e. He gave an example in the treaty of Methuen, in which the admi&s;&s;ion of Briti&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wool|ens by Portugal was balanced by the admi&s;&s;ion of Por|tugal wine, by Great-Britain. The treaty with France of late date, was another example, where a variety of reciprocal privileges and countervailing duties, were minutely provided for. Where no treaties exi&s;ted or where they were &s;ilent, there were often legal regula|tions reciprocating the regulations of Great Britain. He referred to the laws of Sweden and Denmark on the &s;ubject of manufactures a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in&s;tances.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid Great-Britain treats us as well as other na|tions treat us. What nation he a&s;ked, had &s;uch a navi|gation act? What nation be&s;ides, excludes us from a circuitous trade? What nation excludes us from carry|ing our own commodities in our own bottoms, where the carriage is allowed to her bottoms?</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that at lea&s;t Great-Britain treats us s well as we are treated by France, who will be favored by the re&s;olutions. This point was particularly labored ye&s;|terday,

by the gentleman from South-Carolina (Mr. Smith) who made a compari&s;on of tho&s;e two coun|tries the principal ba&s;is of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. As they were in fact the two countries which &s;tood in the mo&s;t im|portant relations to the United States, the &s;ubject re|quired a pretty accurate view of their re&s;pective di&s;po|&s;itions, regulations, and intercour&s;e with this coun|try.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of the di&s;po&s;itions of France and Great-Britain towards the United States, the gentle|man (Mr. Smith) was of a very different opinion, Mr. Madi&s;on ob&s;erved, from that expre&s;&s;ed in the me&s;&s;age of the Pre&s;ident. The me&s;&s;age informed the hou&s;e, that France had generally manife&s;ted a friendly di&s;po&s;ition towards the United States, had granted advantages to their commerce, and had actually made overtures for placing it permanently on a better footing. While the language of the communications, with re&s;pect to Great-Britain, &s;ufficiently proves that there was no room for compliments of a like kind to that nation.</P>
<P>He meant to &s;hew, however, from a particular re|view, in what light the two nations &s;tood to us; and for that purpo&s;e &s;hould &s;ubmit to the committee com|parative &s;tatement, as the gentleman had done, of their commercial policy towards us. He premi&s;ed, however, that he could not follow the example of recurring to a period antecedent to the French revolution for evidence in relation to France. Mr. Smith &s;eemed to think, that the order of things &s;ub&s;equent to that period, could not be regarded as a &s;ettled order. He (Mr.Madi&s;on) on the contrary, con&s;idered it as the only &s;ettled order. He hoped and believed, that the revolution was not a fugitive thing, as &s;ome might wi&s;h, but that it was irrever&s;ibly e&s;tab|li&s;hed; and that the new republic would flouri&s;h for ever on the ruins of the ancient monarchy. He &s;hould not, however, he &s;aid, reject from his enquiry, what was done previous to the date of the republic in favor of the United States, becau&s;e it could not be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that the di&s;po&s;ition of the nation would be le&s;s favorable now, than it was under the former govern|ment.</P>

<P>Of all the objections which Mr. Madi&s;on had heard &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t the re&s;olutions, the mo&s;t extravagant and chimerical was the idea of a war with Great-Bri|tain in con&s;equence of them. He was at a lo&s;s to &s;ay whether &s;uch an objection were a greater in&s;ult to the character of that nation or to the under&s;tanding of America. At the utmo&s;t the propo&s;itions go only to a reciprocity. They do not in fact go &s;o far. On what imaginable pretext then can Great-Britain make was upon us. If we were no longer colonies, but indepen|dent &s;tates, we &s;urely can do what all independent &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es do, regulate our trade as may &s;oit our own intere&s;ts.&mdash; And Great-Britain can have the lea&s;t right of any na|tion to complain of it, becau&s;e it is her own example which we follow. If war therefore &s;hould be made on us it would only prove a fixt predetermination to make it. And in that ca&s;e pretexts more plau&s;ible than any commercial regulations could ea&s;ily be found or framed for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The next ground on which he examined the &s;ubject was it's operation among the &s;everal parts of the uni|on. It was admitted and regretted, that the immediate benefits and burdens would not be equally di&s;tributed among all the &s;tates. More than a due &s;hare of the former would flow to the northern divi&s;ion: More than a due &s;hare of the latter would fall on the &s;outhern.&mdash; This was unavoidably produced by the unequal advanc|es made in manufactures and navigation; and it was an inconvenience that had nece&s;&s;arily taken place in a vari|ety of other in&s;tances. It would be found, however, on a fair attention to the &s;ubject, that the inequality would be le&s;s than at fir&s;t appeared.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to manufactures, the &s;outhern &s;tates were at lea&s;t equally intere&s;ted in encouraging and di&s;tri|buting a competition for our market, among different nations of Europe, in&s;tead of being &s;o much in the hands of a &s;ingle one.</P>
<P>The duty on the &s;iner articles imported would fall on tho&s;e mo&s;t able to bear it; and would be pretty equally diffu&s;ed through the union.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="027258_0021_0FD3F2CBB2984D10">The duty on the coar&s;er articles would be &s;aved in proportion to the progre&s;s made in manufactures among our&s;elves; and he was able to &s;ay, with great plea&s;ure, that tho&s;e carried on, not in public factories, but in the hou&s;hold or family way, which he regarded as the mo&s;t important way, were nearly, if not quite as far advanced in the &s;outhern country as in the middle and northern. Virginia was proceeding with great &s;pirit in this branch of indu&s;try. North-Carolina he under&s;tood was doing the &s;ame; and there was no rea&s;on why the more &s;outh|ern &s;tates would not avail them&s;elves of the re&s;ource, e&s;pecially as they enjoyed &s;uperior advantages in the article of cotton, a primary material for the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The exports would not be materially affected, unle&s;s Great Britain &s;hould, contrary to all probability, re|nounce the benefits of the trade in them, and expo&s;e her We&s;t-India i&s;land to the danger of famine; and in that Ca&s;e, the inconveniences would not be local, but general.</P>
<P>Even in the article of tonnage, the inequality at pre|&s;ent, though con&s;iderable, was not &s;o great as he had imagined, before he examined the real &s;tate of it. It appeared, from the official reports lately made on that &s;ubject, that the &s;tates &s;outh of Penn&s;ylvania (which has about her due &s;hare) have within one-third of their due quota. Georgia has more than her &s;hare. South-Caro|lina nearly her &s;hare. North-Carolina has three-eighths below her &s;hare. Virginia has about half her &s;hare. Maryland has more than her &s;hare. Delaware le&s;s than her &s;hare.</P>
<P>This computation is not, perhaps, very accurate, becau&s;e it is founded on the relative population of the &s;tates. It &s;hould rather have reference to the value and volume of the produce exported from the &s;everal &s;tates: But as &s;everal of them carry on their trade through their neighbors, this rule of calculation would, in fact, be more uncertain than the other.</P>
<P>Whatever be the rule, Virginia, he remarked, was the &s;tate that appeared mo&s;t deficient; her exports, both in value and bulk, being in full proportion to her po|pulation, and her tonnage being more &s;hort of that, than could be &s;aid of any &s;tate. He had every rea&s;on, not|with&s;tanding,
<PB N="23" REF="027258_0022_0FD3F2CDB0FEA210">
to believe, that the great body of the people of Virginia would cheerfully concur in any tem|porary &s;acrifices that might be nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate our public rights, and our commercial intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>It was a con&s;ideration that ought to have great weight with the &s;outhern &s;tates, that a home market for their naval <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ores would be extended by every mea&s;ure favor|ing our own navigation; and that they mu&s;t &s;oon begin them&s;elves to turn to effect their natural advantages for &s;hip-building. Having the materials on the &s;pot, they would not be long in imitating their northern brethren. North-Carolina was &s;ingularly favored in this particular. There was not a &s;ingle article u&s;ed in the various compo|nent parts of a &s;hip, which &s;he did not po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;s, or could not rai&s;e within her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The capacity of the United States, to provide w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> celerity for the tran&s;portation of her produce, was &s;trong|ly atte&s;ted by what they had effected before the revo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tion. In the marine of the Briti&s;h empire, whil&s;t the United States were part of it, the American built &s;hips were to the Briti&s;h built as 23 to 40. New-England furni&s;hed about three-fifths of the formar.</P>
<P>In two points of view, the &s;outhern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were pe|culiarly intere&s;ted in promoting our navigation.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t&mdash;As they are, in &s;ome re&s;pects, the weaker part of the union, and have mo&s;t wealth expo&s;ed on the &s;ea, they have mo&s;t need of that protection which re|&s;ults from exten&s;ive marine re&s;ources. The exi&s;tence of the&s;e will either prevent attack, or can readily be turned into the means of repelling it.</P>
<P>Secondly&mdash;As they have &s;o much valuable and bulky produce to carry to market, it is their intere&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;s a conveyance for it, that may be as little affected as po&s;&s;ible by the contingencies and wars of other nations; and particularly of Great Britain, a nation which is &s;o frequently at war, and which has &s;o di&s;proportionate a &s;hare in our carrying trade. This &s;ubject, he &s;aid, had been placed in &s;o &s;triking a view by the Secretary of State, in a former report on the fi&s;heries, that he &s;hould rely on the patience of the committee in reading the ob&s;ervations and calculations to which he alluded. He here read the following note at the end of that report;</P>

<P>In every term of &s;even years, then, we pay three times three million two hundred and fifty thou&s;and dol|lars, or nine million &s;even hundred and fifty thou&s;and, which, averaged on the years of peace and war, are annually and con&s;tantly one million three hundred and ninety-two thou&s;and eight hundred and fifty-&s;even more than we &s;hould, if we could rai&s;e our own &s;hipping to be competent to the carriage of all our productions. Be&s;ides this, many of our bulky articles, not bearing a war freight, cannot be exported, if expo&s;ed, to that, &s;o that their total lo&s;s is to be added to that before e&s;timat|ed.</P>
<P>This was a demon&s;tration of the intere&s;t the United States had, particularly the &s;outhern &s;tates, in obtaining an independent tran&s;portation for their commodities; and the effect of the pre&s;ent war to which Britain as a party. In depriving them of the ordinary foreign re|source, is bringing the evidence home to their feelings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;ent moment.</P>
<P>I had been a&s;ked what ground there was for con|cluding, that Great-Britain would be led by the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed, to change her policy towards the United states. He thought we had the be&s;t ground for relying on &s;uch an effect.</P>
<P>It is well known, that when &s;he apprehended &s;uch mea&s;ures would be taken, &s;he manife&s;ted a readine&s;s to admit a greater reciprocity into the commerce between the two countries. A bill for the purpo&s;e was brought into the hou&s;e of commons by the pre&s;ent mini&s;ter, Mr. Pitt, and would probably have pa&s;&s;ed into a law, if hopes had not &s;prung up that they &s;hould be able to maintain their exclu&s;ive &s;y&s;tem. Knox, an under &s;e|cretary, appears from a collection of papers publi&s;hed by him, to have been the chief advi&s;ers in the cabinet, as Lord Sheffield was the great champion before the public, of this experiment. It was founded according to both the&s;e w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;&s;es, on a belief&mdash;1&s;t. That Nova-Scotia and Canada, would &s;oon be able to feed the We&s;t-Indies, and thereby make them independent of &s;up|plies from the united States.&mdash;2dly. That the gene|ral government<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was &s;o feeble that it could not exec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">

plan of retaliating re&s;triction&mdash;and, 3dly. That local intere&s;ts and prejudices predominated &s;o much among the &s;tates, that they would never even agree in making an attempt.</P>
<P>It is now thoroughly under&s;tood and admitted by the mo&s;t bia&s;&s;ed judges, that the Briti&s;h continental colo|nies cannot &s;upply the i&s;lands: that as well as the i&s;l|ands, they depend frequently for e&s;&s;ential &s;upplies on the United States. This calculation therefore has failed Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The next has been completely de&s;troyed by the change of our former frail confederacy, into a govern|ment which is found to be adequate to all its national objeds. &mdash;This hope has therefore in like manner fail|ed.</P>
<P>The only remaining hope that can induce Great-Britain to per&s;evere in the plan of conduct &s;he has adopt|ed towards the United States, lies in the &s;uppo&s;ed diffi|culty of reconciling their different intere&s;ts and local pre|judicies. The pre&s;ent occa&s;ion will decide whether this hope al&s;o &s;hall be withdrawn from her; or whether &s;he is to be in&s;pired with fre&s;h confidence in pur&s;uing her own interests without a due re&s;pect either for our in|tere&s;ts or for our rights</P>
<P>He could not but view the pre&s;ent as perhaps the final chance of combining the opinions and intere&s;ts of the &s;everal quarters of the Union in &s;ome proper and adequate plan. If at a moment when &s;o many occur|rences con&s;pire to unite the public councils; when the public mind is &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to &s;econd all equitable and peaceable means of doing ju&s;tice to our country; and when our commerce is &s;o critically important to the vital re&s;ources of Great-Britain, it &s;hould be found that nothing can be done, he could fore&s;ee no circum&s;tances under which &s;ucce&s;s was to be expected. To reject the propo&s;itions therefore, whil&s;t nothing better was &s;ub&s;tituted, mu&s;t convey the mo&s;t unfavorable impre&s;&s;i|ons of our national character, and rivet the fetters on our commerce, as well as prolong other cau&s;es which had produced &s;uch injurious con&s;equences to our coun|try. He would not permit him&s;elf to apprehend that
<PB N="27" REF="027258_0026_0FD3F2D54B7F5C00">
&s;uch would be the event of the deliberations of the com|mittee.</P>
<P>As it appeared, he &s;aid, that mo&s;t of the objections again&s;t the propo&s;ed Re&s;olutions, had been made by tho&s;e who meant to combat them, and that a que&s;tion would &s;oon be called for; it might perhaps be expect|ed that he &s;hould review tho&s;e objections, and a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;ons which induced him to continue in the opinion he at fir&s;t entertained. He wi&s;hed it not to be under|&s;tood, that he meant to examine every particular argu|ment, which in the cour&s;e of &s;o exten&s;ive a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, had been oppo&s;ed to the mea&s;ure. The committee mu&s;t have perceived, that &s;ome of them had been of a nature not to merit an an&s;wer; and that others had &s;ufficiently an&s;wered them&s;elves. He &s;hould extend his ob&s;ervations to &s;uch topics only as might be thought to need explanation, and to have an influence on the que&s;|tion.</P>
<P>Previous, however, to this general &s;urvey of the ground which had been travelled over he &s;hould &s;o far pre&s;ume on the patience of the committee, as to recur to the original oppo&s;ition made by the member from South-Carolina (Mr. Smith) and to take notice of &s;ome particulars in what had been urged by him, which were left unan&s;wered at the time.</P>
<P>The gentleman had thought proper to introduce his di&s;cour&s;e with a very unmerited attack on the late Secre|tary of State, and to mingle with it a variety of cri|tici&s;ms on the facts and opinions &s;tated in his report, on the &s;ubject under con&s;ideration. The &s;pirit and manner in which the attack had been made, and which could not have e&s;caped the attention of the committee. would be left in that &s;ilence which may be&s;t expre&s;s the &s;entiment they mu&s;t have in&s;pired. He &s;hould indeed have thought it le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to take further notice than he had already done, of the matter of the gentleman's remarks, if attempts had not been made, particularly by a friend of the gentleman (Mr. Ames) to give a weight to his &s;tatements and inferences, which it would be &s;hewn they did not merit: and if the ta&s;k did not afford
<PB N="28" REF="027258_0027_0FD3F2D7A167C9D0">
an opportunity of eludicating &s;ome particular points relied on, by the opponents of the re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>It was made a charge again&s;t the &s;ecretary of State, that he takes no notice of the <HI>higher</HI> duty impo&s;ed by Great-Britain on other foreign tobacco, than is impo&s;|ed on American (the former being 3&s;6 &s;ter. a pound, the latter 1&s;3) whil&s;t he takes care to mention the <HI>high</HI> duty impo&s;ed on the American; although the di&s;cri|mination is in favor of the United States, and is again&s;t Portugal, a country in particular connection with Great-Britain; and although the high duty of 1&s;3 is immaterial to the United States, being paid by the con&s;umer of the Tobacco in Great-Britain.</P>
<P>It was unfortunate for the gentleman that this charge is fallacious in every member of it.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The di&s;crimination is not in favor of the Unit|ed States, either in its intention, or in its operation; not in its intention becau&s;e it was made in reference to this country, when it was a part of the Briti&s;h Em|pire, and not in reference to us as Independent States; not in its operation, becau&s;e if the di&s;crimination were aboli&s;hed, it would bring no rival of our tobacco into the Briti&s;h market. This is proved by the fact, that in other markets, as that of France, where no &s;uch di&s;crimination exi&s;ts, the American tobacco is without a rival. It was well known that this and the other apparent favors to this country, were a remnant of the Old Colonial code, which having become a dead let|ter in the Statute book, had not yet been &s;truck out of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If the di&s;crimination had no effect in favor of the United States, it could not for the &s;ame rea&s;on, be a prejudice to Portugal. If it were nece&s;&s;ary and pro|per to go into the enquiry, more direct proofs could be given on this point.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. High duties do affect the United States which produce the article, though paid by the Briti&s;h con&s;um|ers. They have a double effect: They le&s;&s;en the quan|tity called for; and by le&s;&s;ening the competition, they le&s;&s;en al&s;o the price. This was a truth that could need no comment.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="29" REF="027258_0028_0FD3F2D8D71EC708">It was to be remarked however, that the zeal of the gentleman on this &s;ubject, was &s;uch, that it had led him to extend the fallacy of his rea&s;oning to rice, the &s;taple article of his own State. This article pays a duty of 7&s;4 &s;ter. per hundred weight, but like the duty on tobacco, being paid by the con&s;umer, was &s;aid to be of little concern to us.</P>
<P>Call the price of rice 10&s; &s;terling: the duty is 7&s;4. The whole cla&s;s of people then, in Great-Britain, be|tween the cla&s;s who cannot afford to eat rice at the price of 10&s;. and the cla&s;s who are willing to eat it at 17&s;4 are prohibited the con&s;umption by the duty. Was this a circum&s;tance of no concern to the rice planters? The gentleman &s;hould have been reminded of his error by his own arguments.</P>
<P>As an apology for the duty impo&s;ed in Great-Britain, he tells us it was meant to prevent the u&s;e of rice as a <HI>Sub&s;titute,</HI> for the bread-&s;tuffs produced by Great-Bri|tain her&s;elf. Without the preventing duty then, rice would have been <HI>Sub&s;tituted</HI> in place of wheat, in the opinion of the Briti&s;h Parliament, and the demand for it, in the Briti&s;h market, &s;o far increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>As a merit in the Briti&s;h We&s;t-India regulations over tho&s;e of France, it was &s;tated by the gentleman, that rice in the We&s;t-Indies is a common food; that in the Briti&s;h, the importation of it is free; in the French, &s;ubject to a duty, though an incon&s;iderable one. In Britain then, where there is a high duty, rice is not an article of common food; in the i&s;lands where there is no duty, it is a common food; and the advantage of the Briti&s;h We&s;t-India market to us over the French, is, that the duty in the latter favors <HI>cheaper Sub&s;ti|tutes.</HI></P>
<P>Another proof of the di&s;po&s;ition of Great-Britain to favor the United States in the We&s;t-India market, is the prohibition of all foreign rice but the American.&mdash; The &s;ame remark may be repeated here, which was ap|plied to the di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">mination in favor of our tobacco. It is an old colony regulation that has no effect whatever. What other foreign rice could be brought to the We&s;t-Indies? Is it the Ea&s;t-India rice? that is prohibited
<PB N="30" REF="027258_0029_0FD3F2DA3556C518">
by its di&s;tance. Is it the rice of Portugal? that is pro|hibited by the laws of Portugal, and probably al&s;o by the lower price of the Carolina rice.</P>
<P>The inference which the gentleman had drawn from the comparative regulations of Great-Britain and France on the &s;ubject of rice was &s;o curious that it was worth a moment's attention.</P>
<P>The facts, Mr. Madi&s;on ob&s;erved, &s;tood thus. In France the duty is 1-3 per cent. In Great-Britain 7&s;4 &s;terling a hundred. In the French i&s;lands the duty is 1 per cent. In the Briti&s;h free with a prohibition of other foreign rice.</P>
<P>As the duty of 1 per cent. is &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible, and the prohibition, as &s;hewn, is merely nominal, the ine|quality in the i&s;lands may be regarded as too immateri|al to affect the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing to the two parent &s;tates, the duty in France is 1-8 per cent.&mdash;The duty in Great-Britain, 50 or 60 per cent.</P>
<P>Here then is nearly an equality in one part, and a dif|ference of 50 or 60 per cent. in the other part of the two dominions; and yet the gentleman could &s;ay, it was not ea&s;y to pronounce, whether the article of rice &s;tands on a better footing in the &s;y&s;tem of the one, than in the &s;y&s;tem of the other.</P>
<P>Another charge again&s;t the &s;ecretary of &s;tate is, that his report calls the di&s;criminating duties in Great-Britain in favor of American <HI>wood,</HI> &s;mall, whereas they are con|&s;iderable, and in &s;everal in&s;tances high.</P>
<P>Mr. Madi&s;on &s;aid he had not found lei&s;ure to trace this branch of our exports into all the details nece&s;&s;ary to decide in what degree the duties were &s;mall or con|&s;iderable, and in what proportion the &s;everal dutied ar|ticles went to Great-Britain. He ob&s;erved in general that the greater part of our woods were exported to the We&s;t-Indies, not to Great-Britain. That in the &s;hip|woods at lea&s;t the Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ic nations were not rivals to the United States. It was known that Sweden and Den|mark were &s;o deficien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in Out that their public navies were &s;upplied from Germany, and that the &s;hip timbers of Ru&s;&s;ia were tran&s;ported a thou&s;and or twelve hun|dred

miles from her interior dominions. The Fir, of which the Swedi&s;h and Dani&s;h merchant &s;hips were built, does not la&s;t more than &s;even or eight years, and could not therefore be a rival to the durable woods of the United States.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved al&s;o that lumber, and particularly the &s;hip woods of the country, were &s;o precious and &s;o &s;ure of being in demand, that they never could fear a rival, or need a foreign bounty. This was an article very different from &s;uch as were an annual product of the earth, and as could be rai&s;ed wherever the climate and &s;oil permitted according to the occa&s;ional demand. The fore&s;ts that were to &s;upply the &s;hip yards were the growth of centuries, and where once de&s;troyed, as they generally are in Europe, are rarely replaced at all, and never can become the rival to America, which enjoys them as the &s;pontaneous gift of nature.</P>
<P>To enhance the merit of the Briti&s;h regulations, the gentleman had told us, that wood was &s;ubject to a duty of 1 per cent. in the French I&s;lands, and in the Briti&s;h free, with a prohibition of other foreign wood. This was of little con&s;equence. The duty was a trifle, and falling on a nece&s;&s;ary article to be got no where el&s;e, probably was paid by the French i&s;lariders. And the prohibition was ideal, the American wood being the only re&s;ource for the Briti&s;h market.</P>
<P>The article of <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> was admitted by the gentleman him&s;elf to be more favored by the French than the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem, though he admits it with reluctance and dimini&s;hes the difference as much as po&s;&s;ible. The ca&s;e however is &s;o clear, and the facts &s;o palpable, that they &s;peak for them&s;elves. Under the French regulations, this important article of our commerce is &s;ubject to duties only, in Europe and the We&s;t-Indies. Under the Briti&s;h, it is under prohibition in both. The amount of the whole export is 382,237 quintals of dry, and 57,424 barrels of pickled fi&s;h. Of this the French con&s;umption, is 252,171, quintals and 45,164 barrels; that is, nearly 2-3ds of the dry, and 4-5ths of the pickled fi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="027258_0031_0FD3F2DDCB6F0468">Here Mr. Madi&s;on, proceeding to the &s;ubject of whale oil, called the attention of the committee parti|cularly to the repre&s;entation and language of Mr. Smith as to the conduct of France, in inviting the fi&s;hermen of Nantucket to remove and &s;ettle at Dunkirk. Mr. Smith, he &s;aid, had not only undervalued the monopoly of the French market granted to the United States, but had, by a mutilated quotation of a report of the &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate on the fi&s;heries, changed the true a&s;pect of the attempt to draw away the Nantueket fi&s;hermen. The fact was, that although the conduct of France was very different from what was to have been wi&s;hed, as well as from what was contemplated by the marquis la Fayette, who had patrionized the intere&s;t of fi&s;her|men, yet that the project of tempting them to emigrate had originated in Great-Britain, and was a <HI>counter pro|ject</HI> on the part of France. How the gentleman hap|pened to omit the antecedent attempt of Great-Britain, and thereby exaggerate that of France, Mr. Madi&s;on did not undertake to explain: but it was the more ex|traordinary, as the whole account of the tran&s;action was contained in the &s;ame page of the report, nay, in the &s;ame paragraph, from which the gentleman had extract|ed his information.</P>
<P>Here he read the pa&s;&s;age in that report and produced the Briti&s;h &s;tatute, inviting the whale fi&s;hermen, by an offer of certain privileges, to emigrate to Great-Bri|tain.</P>
<P>A further charge again&s;t the &s;ecretary of &s;tate is that in his &s;tatement of the tonnage of the United States employed in the trade with the French and Briti&s;h do|minions; he founds it, not on the <HI>actual number of &s;hips,</HI> but on the number of <HI>entries.</HI> This charge was as &s;ingular as it was uncandid.</P>
<P>The report &s;tated the fact, that the American tonnage <HI>entering</HI> our ports from the &s;everal nations with which the United States traded, was &s;o and &s;o; and in this &s;tatement, it pur&s;ued the official returns made on the &s;ubject. What more was to be required?</P>
<P>In giving the fact, the Secretary impo&s;ed on no one, In cau&s;e he &s;tated the tonnage to be entry tonnage, as it really was.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="027258_0032_0FD3F2DEE8F5AC08">He followed the be&s;t guide that exi&s;ted, an official re|turn from the proper offices.</P>
<P>No return of the <HI>actual</HI> tonnage, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>entry</HI> tonnage, had at the time, ever been made from any office, or called for by any act, of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t return ever made in the latter form, was called for &s;ince the Re&s;olutions on the table were pro|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations might have re&s;trained the gen|tleman from this unwarranted attack on the accuracy of the Report.</P>
<P>But he ought at lea&s;t to have been &s;ure, that whil&s;t he was charging the &s;ecretary with following an erro|neous guide, he was him&s;elf following one that was not erroneous. The examination of this point involved facts which merited the particular attention of the committee.</P>
<P>The &s;tatement of the <HI>entry tonnage</HI> of the United States in <HI>foreign</HI> trade for 1792, lately called for and reported, is 415,331 tons. The &s;tatement of the <HI>act|ual</HI> tonnage for the <HI>&s;ame</HI> year is 239,394 tons.</P>
<P>On comparing the&s;e two quantities, it was evident that both could not be right. If the <HI>entry</HI> tonnage was no more than was &s;tated, it was inconceivable that the <HI>actual</HI> tonnage cauld be as much as was &s;tated. It would allow the ve&s;&s;els in the European and We&s;t-India trades together, but &s;ome what more than one voyage and a third a year. It could never be &s;uppo&s;ed, that this corre&s;ponded with the fact. How then was the incon|&s;i&s;tency in the two &s;tatements to be explained? Mr. Madi&s;on &s;aid, as he did not know by what rule the actual tonnage was made up, he would form no con|jecture on the &s;ubject. He hoped, and wi&s;hed that &s;ome gentleman more conver&s;ant with it, would &s;olve the phenomenon. He did not call on the gentleman from South-Carolina, becau&s;e he mo&s;t of all, mu&s;t be puzzled to account for it; having &s;tated that our ve&s;&s;els in the trade to Europe make <HI>two</HI> voyages, and in the We&s;t-In|dia trade <HI>four</HI> voyages a year.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the evidence contained in this compari&s;on of the aggregate tonnage in the two different forms, in
<PB N="34" REF="027258_0033_0FD3F2E299DAC258">
which it had been reported, the exi&s;tence of error &s;ome where, and probably in the account of the actual ton|nage, re&s;ulted from a comparative view of our exports to the Briti&s;h dominions, for the two years of 1790 and 1792, and of the whole tonnage American and Briti&s;h employed in conveying them.</P>
<P>In the former year, the exports were 9,363,416 dollars. In the latter, 8,269,495 dollars: the exce&s;s for 1790, 1,093,921 dollars.</P>
<P>The entry tonnage, Briti&s;h and American, for 1790, was 273,580 tons.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h <HI>entry</HI> tonnage, for 1792, was 206,384 tons. The <HI>actual</HI> American tonnage, for 1792, was, according to the official &s;tatement, 66,582 tons: which, turned into entry tonnage, according to the proportion of the whole actual, to the whole entry tonnage for that year, makes the American entry tonnage, in the trade to Great Britain, about 95,000 tons. Adding this to the Briti&s;h entry tonnage of 206,384 tons, the Briti&s;h and American together, for 1792, amounts to 301,384 tons; which exceeds the tonnage of 1790 no le&s;s than 27,804 tons.</P>
<P>According to this calculation, which embraces the actual tonnage as &s;tated to the hou&s;e, there would be 27,804 tons more, employed in tran&s;porting 1,093,921 dollars le&s;s: making our tonnage to increa&s;e in that proportion as the employment of it decrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>There was a po&s;&s;ibility, Mr. Madi&s;on ob&s;erved, that the cour&s;e of trade in the two years might be &s;uch, that more of the ve&s;&s;els employed in the exportations to Great Britain might be entered in 1790 as coming from &s;ome other country, than in 1792; but as there was no known circum&s;tance which authorized this &s;olution, and as it &s;eemed demon&s;trable in general, that error exi&s;ted &s;omewhere in the &s;tatements, and mo&s;t proba|bly in tho&s;e of the actual tonnage, he concluded, that it ought to be referred to that &s;ource; and, con&s;equent|ly, that the guide followed by the Secretary of State, to wit. the entry tonnage, the only one he had to fol|low, was not more inaccurate, than the actual tonnage would have been, which guided the member from South-Carolina.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="027258_0034_0FD3F2E510259738">Another po&s;ition of the &s;ecretary of &s;tate on which a charge is founded is, "that the <HI>greater</HI> part of what Great-Britain receives from the United States is re-exported." This po&s;ition, Mr. Madi&s;on reminded the committee, related to Great-Britain, without com|prehending the We&s;t-India i&s;lands; which formed a di&s;tinct branch in the &s;ecretary's report. How far it was liable to the exceptions taken again&s;t it, would ap|pear from an examination of facts.</P>
<P>To obviate critici&s;ms, Mr. Madi&s;on &s;aid he would take for the ba&s;is of his calculations, the &s;tatement giv|en in detail by the gentleman him&s;elf, of the exports for 1790 to the French and Briti&s;h dominions; which though not extended to every item, approached &s;o near to a full view of the trade, as to be adequate to the pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>In the &s;tatement the exports to Great-Britain &s;tand at 6,651,429 dollars: from which mu&s;t be &s;ubtracted, for the compari&s;on, the amount of the &s;everal re-ex-|portations as far as they can be liquidated.</P>
<P><HI>Tobacco.</HI> It appears from an official document, that the tobacco exported to Great-Britain in 1791, was 67,286 hog&s;heads. A return for another year &s;tates the quantity to be 52,505 hog&s;heads. It appeared from the revenue returns of Great-Britain, that the con&s;umption of this article amounted to 9,600 hog&s;heads. The pro|portion re-exported might then be rea&s;onably &s;et down at four-fifths of the quantity imported.</P>
<P><HI>Rice.</HI> To obtain the proportion of rice re-exported, we may take the medium quantity imported for three years immediately preceeding the revolution, which, according to a table in Ander&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Com|merce, was 486,543 cwt. By another table for the &s;ame period, the medium quantity exported was 349, 653 cwt. The difference marks the con&s;umption, and is 136,890 cwt. The quantity exported to Great-Bri|tain from the United States in 1792, was 58,978 bar|rels, equal to 294,890 cwt. Comparing the quantity con&s;umed with this quantity, it appears that more than half, though le&s;s than two-thirds, is re-exported&mdash;call

<P><HI>Indigo.</HI> According to a &s;tatement in Ander&s;on, the medium importations into Great-Britain, for three years immediately preceeding the revolution, were about thrice the mediun quantity exported. Call the proportion re-exported now, however, one-fifth only, which is probably below the fact.</P>

Here, then, it appears, that their exportations of the four articles alone, of Tobacco, Rice, Indigo, &amp; Wheat, are greater than the whole con&s;umption in Great-Bri|tain, of the articles imported from the United States, although the mo&s;t uafavorable year has been taken, for the enquiry; and, con&s;equently, that the po&s;ition of the Secretary of State, was well founded.</P>
<P>If it were nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;tigate the full amount of re-exportations, &s;everal articles might have been added to the li&s;t, &s;uch as Whale Oil, Gin&s;eng, Flax-Seed, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Nor would it be unfair, perhaps, to include the pri|mitive value of the articles, re-exported in the new forms givtn to them by art, A great proportion of what is &s;ent from the United States to Great-Britain, in a rude &s;tate, is worked into articles of merchanize, and exported in the cour&s;e of trade. Take for exam|ple, the two articles of Pot and Pearl A&s;hes, and Indi|go.</P>
<P>The amount of the export of the former to Great-|Britain, is &s;tated at 747,078 dollars; of which, if no part is re-exported in its unaltered &s;tate, the whole en|ters into Briti&s;h manufactures. Suppo&s;ing one-third of the&s;e particular manufactures, to be exported, which appears to be nearly the general proportion, the value of Pot and Pearl A&s;hes re-exported, is 249,026 dollars. The Indigo u&s;ed in Great-Britain has appeared to be 379,064 dollars, one-third of which re exported as an ingredient in manufactures, is 126,354 2-3 dollars&mdash; Tne&s;e two items alone amount to 375,280 2-3 dollars; and with many others, might be added to the ma&s;s of re-exportatios. But they are &s;tated rather to throw light on the general character of our trade with Great|Britain, than to be relied on in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, which has been &s;ufficiently elucidated by moredirect and &s;im|ple views of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Madi&s;on proceeded to apply the calculations he had made, to the que&s;tion di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by Mr. Smith, in re|lation to the comparative importance of the French and Briti&s;h markets to the productions of the U.S.</P>
<P>By deducting the 3,501,067 dollars, re-exported, from the 6,651,429 dollars, imported into Great-Bri|tain,
<PB N="38" REF="027258_0037_0FD3F2EB9F50EFF0">
he reduced her actual con&s;umption to 3,150,360 dollars, to which adding the 1,805,744 exported to the We&s;t-India market, the whole Briti&s;h con&s;umption &s;tands at no more than 4,956,106 dollars. On campar|ing this with the exports to the French dominions (which re-export none of any con&s;equence) to wit, 4,424,336, the &s;ubject took a very different a&s;pect from that which had been given to it.</P>
<P>But there was, Mr. Madi&s;on ob&s;erved, a circum|&s;tance of the utmo&s;t importance to a fair view of this que&s;tion, which had been wholly overlooked by the gen|tleman from S. Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lina, and which cut up his calcula|tions by the roots. The re-exportations from Great-Britain were not only to be &s;ubtracted from the con|&s;umption of Great-Britain but in a great degree being made to France, were <HI>to be added to the value of her market</HI> to the agriculture and commerce of the United States.</P>
<P>The re-exportation from Great-Britain to France, could not be accurately fixed by any documents to be had here. In general, they were known to be great. He would, he &s;aid, confine him&s;elf to the two articles of Tobacco and Flour, of which he e&s;timated the amounts as follow:</P>
<P>The Tobacco exported from the United States, ap|pears to be about 100,000 hog&s;heads. It is valued in the return of our exports at 4,349,567 dollars. It is known that France con&s;umes about 1-4 of the whole quantity exported, that is, 1,087,392 dollars. It appears, by the return of our exports, that the <HI>direct</HI> exports of this article to France, &s;tands at 384,642 dollars. The <HI>indiract</HI> &s;upplies then to France, not appearing in the returns of our exports, and to be added to them, is 702,750 dollars.</P>
<P>Of the Flour and Grain &s;ent to Great Britain, allow|ing, as above &s;tated, 1-4 to have been there con&s;umed, which is probably beyond the truth, the re-exportation amounted to 815,880 dollars. It is well under&s;tood, that France was the market where the&s;e articles were finally con&s;umed. The account may now be &s;tated.

<P>Thus it appears, without taking into the account the other articles re-exported to France, that the market of that country for our exports, was worth to the Unit|ed States nearly a million more than the market of Great-Britain&mdash;and yet the gentleman from South-Car|olina had repre&s;ented the Briti&s;h markets as exceeding the French in the annual amount of between three and four millions; and had pronounced, without he&s;itation, that Great-Britain in reference to our productions, was <HI>a more important cu&s;tomer</HI> than France, almo&s;t in the <HI>ratio of two to one.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Madi&s;on returning to the Secretary's report &s;aid, he hoped after what had been &s;hewn, it would be need|le&s;s to trouble the committee with further remarks on the &s;ubject. In di&s;mi&s;&s;ing it however, he could not do ju&s;tice to his own impre&s;&s;ions, without declaring his entire confidence, that the report would be regarded by all di&s;cerning and unprejudiced judges, as one of the many monuments which its Author had left behind him, of the zeal, the talents, and the pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oti&s;m with which he had di&s;charged the duties of his &s;tation; and that he had carried with him into retirement, a purity, both in his public and private name, which nothing that could be &s;aid within or without the walis of Congre&s;s, could tarni&s;h.</P>
<P>Having gone through the particular ob&s;ervations into which he had been led by the attack made on the report of the Secretary of State before the committee, he &s;hould proceed, to a more general view of what had been urged by the opponents of the re&s;olutions he had intro|duced.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="027258_0039_0FD3F2EC01239488">
Among other things it had been alledged in the latter &s;tages of the debate, that the friends of the re&s;olutions, had involved them&s;elves in incon&s;i&s;tency, by &s;hifting the ground of argument from commercial to political con|&s;iderations. In an&s;wer to this charge, he remarked, that if in any in&s;tance of his public life he was free from the charge of incon&s;i&s;tency, it was on the &s;ubject of vindicating our national intere&s;t, again&s;t the policy of Great-Britain towards us; that in all the public &s;tations with which he had been honored &s;ince thp peace and on every occa&s;ion which had occurred, his conduct had been marked by an adherence to this principle: that the re&s;olutions he had la&s;t propo&s;ed were founded on this principle: that if in the fir&s;t arguments &s;upporting them, he had dwelt chiefly on commercial topics, it would be recollected that he kept the door open for political ones, if the turn of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion &s;hould re|quire them: that he had forborne to enlarge on the political &s;ides of the que&s;tion, becau&s;e he thought it defen&s;ible on commercial grounds, and was willing to meet it on tho&s;e grounds, becau&s;e he did not wi&s;h to mingle, unnece&s;&s;arily, irritating ideas in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and becau&s;e he had &s;uppo&s;ed that every thing relating to the treaty of peace the Indians, the Algerines, the &s;polistions, &amp;c. were &s;ufficiently imprinted on every mind, and would have all the effects they ought to have, without being particularly enforced.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he could thus repel the charge of incon&s;i&s;ten|cy brought again&s;t him&s;elf; it mu&s;t be evident, he thought, how much room there was for retor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the charge. In the early &s;tages of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, there &s;eemed but one &s;entiment as to the conduct of Great-Britain, at lea&s;t in a political view: the difference turn|ed on the que&s;tion, whether we could or ought to coun|teract her conduct, In the latter &s;tages of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, palliations if not ju&s;tifications had been multiplied and labored; not only with re&s;pect to her commercial policy, but with re&s;pect to the detention of the po&s;ts, the In|dians, the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gerines, and even the &s;poliations of our neutral commerce; on the unlawfulne&s;s of which our
<PB N="41" REF="027258_0040_0FD3F2F01E6B75D8">
executive had grounded the remon&s;trance and demand of indemnification lying on the table.</P>
<P>In addition to this, he &s;tated the incon&s;i&s;tency be|tween tho&s;e who maintained and tho&s;e who rejected the theory of leaving commerce perfectly free; the in|con&s;i&s;tency of rejecting this theory, and yet refu&s;ing to meet re&s;trictions one &s;ide with re&s;trictions on the other; the incon&s;i&s;tency of condemning a commercial di&s;cri|mination between nations, as contrary to the wi&s;e ex|ample of Great-Britain, and, claiming for Great-Britain the credit of making &s;uch di&s;criminations in favor of the United States: The incon&s;i&s;tency of predicting, that the mea&s;ure would de&s;troy the revenue, and in&s;i&s;ting, that the dutied articles would continue to be imported from the &s;ame &s;ource, through more expen&s;ive channels: The incon&s;i&s;tency of exclaiming again&s;t topics and remarks which may awaken the pa&s;&s;ions, and endeavouring them&s;elves to alarm our fears; of exhorting the committee to con|&s;ult its judgment alone, and &s;ub&s;tituting for argument continued addre&s;&s;es to the imagination.</P>
<P>Particular pains, he remarked, had been taken to exhibit a picture of our national pro&s;perity, which might flatter our wi&s;hes, and forbid experiments. It was readily admitted, he &s;aid, that there were many features in the face of our affairs, which were proper themes of mutual congratulation, whether compared with the &s;ituation of other countries, or with our own, under other circum&s;tances. And it gave him much plea&s;ure to add, that the degree of pro&s;perity we enjoy|ed, though not to be exclu&s;ively credited to the change of our federal government, or to particular mea&s;ures under it, according to the exaggerations of &s;ome, was yet &s;o far, and &s;o evidently the fruit of that change, as to do honor to the people of America in adopting it. He mentioned two innovations making part of the con&s;titution, which mu&s;t alone have had a power|ful effect in meliorating the condition of this country, to wit: The prohibition of paper money or other violations of contracts, and the abolition of inco|herent and rival regulations of trade, among the &s;everal
<PB N="42" REF="027258_0041_0FD3F2EE2AF1AED0">
&s;tates. But notwith&s;tanding the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of our affairs, when viewed under certain a&s;pects, it was equal|ly certain that there were others, which &s;ugge&s;ted very different reflexions.</P>
<P>He then went into a review of the actual &s;tate of our commerce, particularly in ralation to Great-Britain; and of the &s;everal injuries of another &s;ort, which that nation had &s;uperadded to her commercial re&s;tric|tions.</P>
<P>He repeated what he had formerly maintained, that there was more of reciprocity in the footing of com|merce between Great-Britain and other countries, and between other countries and the United States, than between Great-Britain and the United States. To prove the fir&s;t point he remarked, that in &s;ome in&s;tances Great-Britain had treaties with other countries which defined and &s;tipulated reciprocal privileges; in other in&s;tances, her re&s;trictions were counter-vailed by laws impo&s;ing re&s;trictions on her. To prove the &s;econd point, he remarked, that no other nation with which the United States carried on commerce, had a navigation act &s;imilar to that of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the intercour&s;e between the United States and Great-Britain, there was, he in&s;i&s;ted, a want of reciprocity throughout, that mu&s;t &s;trike the mo&s;t &s;u|perficial ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>In the article of navigation this had been &s;ufficiently pointed out, and being admitted on all &s;ides, need not be repeated.</P>
<P>In the trade between the two countries, our be&s;t &s;taples, wheat and flour, fi&s;h and oil, &s;alted provi&s;ions, which amount to con&s;iderably more than one-third of our exports, were &s;hut out of her markets; whil&s;t all her be&s;t &s;taples, her woolens, her cottons, her manu|factures of the metals, of leather, and of &s;ilk, were ad|mitted on moderate duties, and enjoyed in a man|ner a monopoly of our market.</P>
<P>In the articles of &s;uperfluity mutually admitted, there was nothing to compen&s;ate the inequality in other ca&s;es. Our tobacco paid a tax of four or five hundred per cent. our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fifty or &s;ixty per cent and our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of
<PB N="43" REF="027258_0042_0FD3F2F191026E60">
of every &s;ort would not be admitted if we were ever &s;o able to &s;end them. On the other hand, her &s;uperfluities were received under duties, which in general did not exceed from &s;even and an half to fifteen per cent.</P>
<P>In the We&s;t-India trade, be&s;ides the exclu&s;ion of our ve&s;&s;els, whil&s;t her own were left free, there were a number of our productions which were not admitted into the market there, whil&s;t our laws refu&s;ed nothing that was brought to the market here.</P>
<P>He next turned, his attention to the injuries and lo&s;&s;es we &s;uffered in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>As he had not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the evidence, he &s;hould, he &s;aid, leave it to tho&s;e who had, to &s;hew how far the Indians were or were not &s;purred on to war again&s;t us, by the agents or parti&s;ans of Great-Britain. It was a &s;ufficient ground of complaint, that the po&s;ts were wrongfully detained; that the detention had a bane|ful influence on the &s;entiments and conduct of the In|dians; and that the &s;upplies for their warfare, were de|rived from a trade, authori&s;ed by the Briti&s;h govern|ment, and protected by the po&s;ts which of right were ours, and ought to be u&s;ed for our defence. He combin|ed this proceeding of Great-Britain, with the law|le&s;s &s;eizure of our ve&s;&s;els under her in&s;tructions of the 8th of June la&s;t, ob&s;erving, that whil&s;t on one &s;ide, &s;he violated the laws of nations, by carrying on a trade in contraband articles with tho&s;e at war with us; &s;he was on another &s;ide, violating the laws of nations, by inter|cepting our trade with tho&s;e at war with her, in articles not contraband.</P>
<P>The Indian war he ob&s;erved, co&s;t us annually a &s;um, exceeding by one million, the &s;um that would probably be &s;ufficient for the defence of our frontiers, if the po&s;ts were in our hands. The fur trade depending on the po&s;ts might, he thought, be fairly valued at two hundred thou&s;and dollars more.</P>
<P>The Algerine depredations appeared to have proceed|ed from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ps taken in pur&s;uance of the views of the Briti&s;h government. If they were not immedietely pointed again&s;t us, it mu&s;t have been known that our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would be the v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lim. The evil therefore may at
<PB N="44" REF="027258_0043_0FD3F2F2F89F29B8">
lea&s;t be charged to an unfriendly di&s;regard of our inter|e&s;ts, if not to a po&s;itive ho&s;tility to them. The pecu|niary amount of this evil, cannot be rated at le&s;s than the expence of the armament propo&s;ed as a remedy.&mdash; This is &s;tated at &s;ix hundred thou&s;and dollars for the out&s;it; and he did not expect that the annual expence would average much le&s;s; to which may be added, at a very low computation, for in&s;urance remaining after the armament, two hundred thou&s;and dollars.</P>
<P>The &s;poliations committed on our neutral commerce by Great-Britain, mu&s;t be of con&s;iderable, though very uncertain amount; and the con&s;equential detriment to our trade in general from the&s;e interruptions and dan|gers, of a very great, though equally uncertain amount. In order to bring both within a &s;afe e&s;timate, he &s;aid he would &s;tate the former at the limitted &s;um of one hundred and fifty thou&s;and dollars, and the latter at no more than four hundred thou&s;and dollars.</P>
<P>In addition to the foregoing e&s;timates he &s;aid there was another item, which though of a different character, fell under a comprehen&s;ive view of our &s;ituation; and being reducible to an amount tolerably definite, ought to find a place here. He referred to the &s;tatement be|fore quoted from a reoprt of the Secretary of State, which &s;hewed that the lo&s;s to the United States from a dependance on Briti&s;h bottoms for the carriage of their produce was no le&s;s annually, in time of war, than three million two hundred and fifty thou&s;and dollars, and in war and peace everaged, no le&s;s than one million three hundred ninety-two thou&s;and eight hundred fifty-&s;even dollars. Allowing about one third of this carriage for the rea&s;onable &s;hare of Great-Britain (and for rea&s;ons formerly derived from the character of our exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orts this was a full &s;hare) the annnal lo&s;s from the dependance might be called about one million of dollars.</P>

<P>From this view of things, it was impo&s;&s;ible to deny, that however pro&s;perous the United States might be in &s;ome re&s;pects, they were in others laboring under vio|lations of their rights and intere&s;ts, which demanded the &s;erious attention of the legi&s;lature. Be&s;ides the unreci|procal footing of their commerce, and the indignities offered them, it was &s;een that they were burdened with an enormous extra expence, and involved in unju&s;t lo&s;&s;|es, amounting to more than three and an half millions of dollars a year; a tax nearly equal to the heavy one they had been obliged to impo&s;e on them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Having taken this view of our &s;ituation, he proceed|ed to con&s;ider how far a remedy was compri&s;ed in the re&s;olutions before the committee, by tracing the proba|ble operation of them, it pa&s;&s;ed into a law. [In this &s;tage of his ob&s;ervations, the hour of adjournment being nearly arrived, he &s;at down, with an intimation that the &s;ubject would be renewed.]</P>
<P>Re&s;uming the train of his ob&s;ervations, he proceed|ed to explain the remedial operations of his propo&s;i|tions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. &mdash;They will make the Briti&s;h nation &s;en&s;ible, that we can, by ju&s;t and pacific means, inflict con&s;e|quences which will make it her intere&s;t, to pay a ju&s;t regard to our rights and intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>To enforce this tendency, he enlarged on the ideas he had formerly expre&s;&s;ed in relation to the dependance of Great-Britain on the commerce of the United States and the obvious and e&s;&s;ential dependance of the Briti&s;h-We&s;t-Indies, on the &s;upplies of the United States.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="027258_0045_0FD3F2F54922DE00">
On the latter &s;ubject, he entered into a particular re|ply to the member from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts (Mr. Ames) who had argued, that the Briti&s;h regulation of the trade between the United States and the We&s;t-Indies, was conformable to the pinciples of the Colony &s;y&s;tem as e&s;tabli&s;hed by the commercial nations of Europe, and could not therefore be rea&s;onably com|plained of. 2. That the We&s;t-Indies could obtain &s;up|plies from other quarters, and did not therefore depend on the United States; nay, that there was danger, by forcing the&s;e &s;upplies into other channels, of our lo&s;ing that branch of trade altogether. 3. That the trade would hardly employ more than a dozen brigs, and was therefore not worth contending for.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the fir&s;t argument of Mr. Ames, Mr. Madi&s;on undertook to &s;hew, that Great-Britain had not pur&s;ued, but violated the principles of the colony &s;y&s;|tem. The true &s;pirit of this &s;y&s;tem, he &s;aid, was to confine the trade between the parent country and the colony, to their own ve&s;&s;els, and to allow as little trade as po&s;&s;ible, between the colony and foreign countries; out when a trade with a foreign country became nece&s;|&s;ary to the colony, <HI>to allow the foreign ve&s;&s;els the &s;ame carrying privileges allowed to their own.</HI> Colonies, he &s;aid, were to be con&s;idered as parts of a common empire. The trade between one part and another, as between London and King&s;ton in Jamaica, was to be con&s;idered equally an internal trade with the coa&s;ting trade between London and Liverpool, or the trade be|tween different ports of the United States: and might, if deemed expedient, be equally re&s;trained to dome&s;tic bottoms. But when a trade was opened between a colony and a foreign country, the ca&s;e was changed: the foreign country became a party, and had a reci|procal claim to the u&s;e of its bottoms, as much in the trade with the colony, as with any other part of the empire to which the colony belonged. In &s;upport of this doctrine. Mr. Madi&s;on referred to the example of every nation in Europe, except that of Great-Britain, which had American colonies. Denmark, Sweden, the United Netherlands, France, Spain and Portugal, had
<PB N="47" REF="027258_0046_0FD3F2F6BAF1E3B8">
their colonies, as well as Great-Britain; and &s;ome of them rigorou&s;ly attached to the principles of the co|lony &s;y&s;tem: yet not a &s;ingle one of the&s;e nations had refu&s;ed, whenever, a trade was permitted at all between the colonies and another country, to make the car|riage common to the ve&s;&s;els of both the parties. Great-Britain alone had attempted a monopoly in &s;uch ca&s;es for her own ve&s;&s;els. Her example therefore was an innovation on the colony &s;y&s;tem, as well as an infraction of the rights of reciprocity.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the 2d po&s;ition of Mr. Ames, he denied that permanent &s;upplies of provi&s;ions and lumber could be derived from any other part of the world than the United States: not from the northern parts of Europe, which either did not produce, or were too remote to &s;end them: not from the &s;outhern parts of Europe, which depended them&s;elves on the northern parts and on America: not from Great-Britain, which imported bread, for her own u&s;e, amounting one year with ano|ther according to the report of the committee of the privy council, to the &s;um of near three hundred thou&s;|and pounds &s;terling, and was certainly not an exporter of lumber: not from Ireland, which could not pretend to rival the United States in any article but that of &s;alt provi&s;ions; and this was &s;o much dearer that a prohi|bition alone of ours, could gain a market for hers. The gentleman had relied on the capacity of Ireland to ex|tend her cultivation of wheat, &s;o as to &s;pare &s;upplies of this article al&s;o. Such a revolution in her interior &s;tate was not very probable. But he ought at lea&s;t to have remembered, that as the pa&s;ture lands of Ireland &s;hould be turned into wheat fields, her export of beef would decrea&s;e, in proportion as the might be enabled to export bread.</P>
<P>It was a wa&s;te of time, Mr. Madi&s;on &s;aid, to di&s;|prove by minute enquiries, the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;upplying the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies from the old continent, on terms that would not be wor&s;e than abandoning them altogether. The truth was, that the gentleman (Mr. Ames) had, in this particular, gone beyond the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uguine advocates of the Briti&s;h policy, Mr. Knox and
<PB N="48" REF="027258_0047_0FD3F2F8562B56B8">
Lord Sheffield them&s;elves, who limited their ultimate hopes of &s;upporting the We&s;t-Indies without the aid of the United States, to the remaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Great-Britain on this continent. He would proceed, he &s;aid, to &s;hew what foundation there was for the opinion of the&s;e gentlemen, and the gentleman from Ma&s;&s;achusetts, in favor of this re&s;ource.&mdash;And he was able to give the mo&s;t full and deci&s;ive evidence in the ca&s;e, by recurring to an authentic document of our own, from which it appeared, that the continental col|onies of Great-Britain, in&s;tead of being able to furni&s;h the We&s;t-India colonies, were them&s;elves dependant for the very articles wanted there, on the &s;upplies of the United States.</P>
<P>In the official &s;tatement of our exports for the year as late as 1791, mo&s;t of the articles &s;ent to the Briti&s;h continental colonies were of a &s;ort and an amount &s;o directly to the point, that he hoped the committee would excu&s;e him for repeating them in detail. He &s;tated them as follows:

<P>Mr. Madi&s;on &s;aid, that he &s;hould not have employ|ed &s;o much of the time of the committee on this head, if the gentleman (Mr. Ames) had not attempted to re|vive

the arguments with re&s;pect to Canada and Nova-Scotia, which had mi&s;led Great-Britain in her politi|cal calculations and her pre&s;ent views. He had heard the language of the gentleman on this &s;ubject, with a&s;toni&s;hment. That Mr. Knox, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ord She <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">held, Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, viewing the pro&s;pect with Briti&s;h eyes, at the di&s;tance of three thou&s;and miles, in the year 178<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> when little enquiry and no experiment could a&s;&s;i&s;t th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, &s;hould have run into the error, was perhaps not &s;o marvellous. But, that an enlightened Citizen of America, &s;eeing with American eyes, living in the neighborhood, as it were, of the &s;cene, in a &s;tate who&s;e wharves afford proofs of the daily depen|dance of the Briti&s;h Continental colonies for the nece&s;|&s;aries of life, on the market of the United States, &s;hould in the year 1994 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the opinion that tho&s;e colonies could &s;upply <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> is after a trial of nine years had probably forced the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hors of the opinion, Knox and Sheffield them&s;elves, to abandon it, could not be heard without &s;ome &s;urprize; and mu&s;t be con&s;idered at lea&s;t as the fulle&s;t proof, that the gentleman had not given &s;ufficient attention to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, to claim that weight which was in general due to his ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Mr. Madi&s;on &s;aid he was not le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed at the 2d po&s;ition of the gentleman from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, viz. that the We&s;t-India trade could be carried on by a doz|en brigs; and con&s;equently, was not an object worth our pur&s;uit. The plain an&s;wer to this argument was, to &s;tate the fact, that the &s;hipping entered in one year from, the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies, was not a dozen brigs, but 107,759 tons.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the immediate importance of this auxilliary re&s;ource for our navigation, he remarked, that there were two con&s;ideration which enhanced the value of the object: one, that as the We&s;t-India articles could be brought cheaper in American ve&s;&s;els they would come cheaper to American con&s;umers; the other, that as our &s;upplies would at the &s;ame time be carried cheaper to the We&s;t-Indies, the people there could afford to con|&s;ume the more of them.</P>
<P>It had been urged, that the propo&s;ed re&s;trictions on the trade with Great-Britain would produce clamors
<PB N="51" REF="027258_0050_0FD3F2FD4577A880">
here as well as there, and that Congre&s;s might be oblig|ed recede, before the Briti&s;h Government would be under the nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;o. To this Mr. Madi&s;on re|plied, that he was under no such apprehen&s;ion. He thought more favorably of the good &s;en&s;e as well as virtue of his follow citizens. On the &s;ide of Great-Britain it had been &s;hewn there would be the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and the lea&s;t ability to bear it. The people there were not accu&s;tomed, like the people of the United States, to &s;elf denying regulations. They would not have the &s;ame confidence in the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e. And it was particularly worthy of remark, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> people of Great-Britain would be di&s;heartened, and the government alarmed, by reflecting, that their lo&s;&s;es from the &s;hift|ing of commerce into other channels, and not only of their manufactures, but manufacturers, to other places, would be permanent and irretrievable; where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s on our &s;ide, they would be temporary &s;acrifices for durable and valuable acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>Secondly&mdash;The re&s;olutions would have the effe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of increa&s;ing our marine, and thereby at once cheapening and &s;ecuring the carriage of our productions, and pro|viding for our &s;afety. The&s;e advantages having been already &s;ufficiently explained, need not, he &s;aid, be again. developed.</P>
<P>It had been remarked by a member from Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts (Mr. Ames) that if as &s;tated by a report of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, Great-Britain was &s;o often at war, her wars, by depriving us of her &s;hipping, would &s;oon have the wi&s;hed effect, of replacing it with American &s;hipping. This rea&s;oning Mr. Madi&s;on &s;aid, &s;uppo&s;ed what was contrary to prudence and probability. What merchants would build &s;hips, which a peace, always more or le&s;s in pro&s;pect, would throw out of employment; unle&s;s it were for &s;pecial purpo&s;es, where the momentary gain might outweigh the eventual &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>It had been &s;aid that our tonnage was proved by the official returns to be increa&s;ing with an unexampled ra|pidity. To this Mr. Madi&s;on an&s;wered, That the in|crea&s;e ought not to be compared with other examples, but with our own natural faculties, and rea&s;onable
<PB N="52" REF="027258_0051_0FD3F2FE364F7140">
expectations&mdash;that the increa&s;e of our population re|quired an annual increa&s;e of at lea&s;t five per cent; that an a&s;&s;umption by foreigners of American names, had probably increa&s;ed the apparent quan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of our &s;hip|ing; that the war, or preparations for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y withdraw|ing foreign &s;hipping, had probably al&s;o had &s;ome little temporary effect; that the principal cau&s;e of the in|crea&s;e, was the extention of our trade with the French dominions, which &s;ome members &s;eemed &s;o little in|clined to &s;ecure and fo&s;ter, by mea&s;ures which appeared to him be&s;t fitted for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>He reminded the committee of an argument, which had, on former occa&s;ions, been much pre&s;&s;ed by &s;everal mercantile members, for encouraging our own navi|gation; to wit: that American ve&s;&s;els, from a &s;pirit of enterprize and a uni&s;on between private and public intere&s;ts, would explore new fields of commerce, and new markets for our produce, which foreign carriers would leave unattempted. The trade to China, opened by American ve&s;&s;els, had been often a&s;cribed to this cau&s;e. Mr. Madi&s;on &s;aid, the argument &s;eemed to be countenanced al&s;o, by the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our Mediter|ranean trade; which had &s;ince our independence, been confined by the Barbary cor&s;airs to foreign bottoms. Previous to the revolution, when American ve&s;&s;els could be the carries, the trade was very con&s;iderable. Since the exclu&s;ion of our ve&s;&s;els, though the carriage of our produce is &s;afe in Briti&s;h, and &s;everal other foreign ve&s;&s;els, yet this branch of trade had withered as much as mo&s;t others have grown. In 1790, the ex|ports cleared for the Mediterreanean, were but 21,726 doliars; and in the year following, the imports no more than 11,522 doliars.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Another effect incident to the propo&s;ed mea&s;ure, would be an additional encouragement to do|me&s;tic manufactures.</P>
<P>A gentleman from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts (Mr. Dexter) had &s;aid, he could read no &s;uch tendency in the propo&s;i|tions. Mr. Madi&s;on thought it impo&s;&s;ible to read the propo&s;itions with attention, and not perceive, that they mu&s;t have the like tendency with the other means, by
<PB N="53" REF="027258_0052_0FD3F302208B2570">
which manufactures had been promoted. If the duties already laid, were calculated to produce this effect, an increa&s;e of tho&s;e duties in any in&s;tance, mu&s;t have a tendency to increa&s;e the effect. In an&s;wer to the ob|jection, that a change in the policy of Great-Britain, might put an end to the additional duties, and en&s;nare tho&s;e who &s;hould proceed under the influence of them, he remarked, 1. That the &s;ame might be &s;aid in &s;ome degree of the regulations now in force. A treaty with Great-Britain might &s;tipulate changes which would af|fect our manufacturers. But as there was a ju&s;t con|fidence, that the intere&s;ts of this cla&s;s of citizens would in this ca&s;e be attended to by the government; it might be expected, that equal attention would be paid to them, in any other ca&s;e. 2. The progre&s;s of things in this country, and the probable acce&s;&s;ion of foreign manufacturers, might be relied on to &s;upport whatever undertaking &s;hall have once got a footing.</P>
<P>Fourthly. The propo&s;ed re&s;olutions would favor an advantageous competition and di&s;tribution of our trade, among the manufacturing nations of Furope. At pre|&s;ent, it may he &s;aid to be monopolized by one; &s;o great is the di&s;proportion of its manufactures which come to our market. That this is an evil, has been admitted, and cannot be doubted. It expo&s;es us to the greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;udden embarra&s;&s;ments from the caprice, the pa&s;&s;ions, the mi&s;taken calculations of intere&s;t, the bank|ruptics, and the wars of a &s;ingle foreign country. Ma|ny of the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments are felt at the pre&s;ent mo|ment. If it were po&s;&s;ible to liquidate them into a pe|cuniary &s;tatement, it would be found that, in a perma|nent view of our intere&s;t, there would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">conomy in making very con&s;iderable temporary &s;acrifices, for the purpo&s;e of dividing our cu&s;tom among a number of competitors. It was not true, that Great-Britain alone can &s;upply the manufactures we want. France, the United Netherlands, and &s;everal other nations, are capable of &s;upplying us with a variety of articles, as well as the nations from which they now come; and, if invited to our markets by prudent encouragements in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, will &s;oon learn to fa&s;hion their manu|factures
<PB N="54" REF="027258_0053_0FD3F3038D0C87C8">
to the wants and ta&s;tes of this country. The policy of favoring particular branches of trade, even at &s;ome expence, in order to guard again&s;t the evil of depending on a &s;ingle one, was exampli&s;ied by the con|duct of Great-Britain her&s;elf. Although he viewed her di&s;criminations generally, re&s;pecting us, in the light he had explained; yet, he thought it po&s;&s;ible, that in the in&s;tance of naval &s;tores and &s;hip-timbers, it might be her intention to fo&s;ter a rival&s;hip in a more di&s;tant quarter, in order to provide again&s;t a ca&s;ual privation of the &s;upplies of a nearer quarter. The&s;e articles are as e&s;&s;ential to the marine of Great-Britain, as her mar|ine is e&s;&s;ential to her greatne&s;s. Were &s;he to have no re&s;ource but in the Baltic, a war with the Baltic powers might be fatal to her. It may be wi&s;e in her, there|fore, to keep open the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rican re&s;ource, even at the price of a tax on her&s;elf. In this ca&s;e, &s;he mu&s;t quar|rel with both the Baltic powers and the United States at the &s;ame time, before the &s;upplies will be cut off.</P>
<P>A member from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts (Mr. Dexter) had not, Mr. Madi&s;on &s;aid, been very con&s;i&s;tent in his rea&s;oning on the &s;ubject. He had contended again&s;t all attempts to excite a beneficial competition, on the idea that no competition could be beneficial which would not &s;pring up of it&s;elf; and yet he had warned us again&s;t the dan|ger, that Great-Britain, by exciting a competition again&s;t the United States, in tho&s;e parts of Europe, which mo&s;t re&s;emble the infant &s;ituation of our country, might e&s;tabli&s;h new &s;ources from which &s;upplies would afterwards &s;pontaneou&s;ly flow to her, without being ever again wanted from the United States. The &s;ame re|mark was applicable to the rea&s;oning of the other gentlemen who had repre&s;ented the danger of exciting a permanent rival&s;hip for the We&s;t-India market, in fa|vor of Canada and Nova-Scotia.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The plan of the re&s;olutions tended to con|cilliate nations in treaty, or di&s;po&s;ed to be in treaty with us, into arrangements &s;till more favorably to our commerce. This argument had peculiar weight in relation to France. It had been &s;aid, that Great-Bri|tain was our be&s;t cu&s;tomer. The fact, he &s;aid, was
<PB N="55" REF="027258_0054_0FD3F304F9D16058">
that we were her be&s;t cu&s;tomer; but that France was our be&s;t cu&s;tomer. We con&s;ume more of Briti&s;h manu|factures than any other nation in the world con&s;umes. France con&s;umes more of our productions, than any other nations con&s;umes.&mdash;He referred to the &s;tatement he had before offered for proof of this. Her con&s;umption was al&s;o of the mo&s;t, valuable kind; and, under favorable regulations, would be a very growing one. It con&s;i&s;ted of wheat and flour, &s;alt provi&s;ions, and fi&s;h; articles which were not admitted by Great-Britain; and which, without the market of France, would, glut every other. Of our fi&s;h &s;he con&s;umed five eigths of the whole exportation. Her u&s;e of our live animals was another important con&s;ideration. It amounted, in the li&s;t of our ex|ports, to 352, 795 dollars, for the year 1791. In the &s;ame year, the Briti&s;h demand amounted to no more than 62, 415 dollars. The &s;uperior <HI>proportion</HI> of navi|gation we enjoyed in the French channels of inter|cour&s;e had already been &s;hewn. In examining the policy of cultivating and &s;ecuring the French market, he &s;aid it ought not to be forgotten, that the profits and revenue ari&s;ing from the rum di&s;tilleries, depended on an article obtained almo&s;t, if not altogether, from the French dominions alone; and which was the only raw material of any con&s;equence imported into the United States. It was paid for al&s;o, as had been much urged on other occa&s;ions by members on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, in the wor&s;t fi&s;h, which could find a vent in no other part of the world. The mola&s;&s;es imported into the United States in one year, amounted to upwards of &s;even millions of gallons, more than one half of which went into the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. He took no|tice al&s;o of the article of &s;ugar, as rendered of great im|portance by our habits and our finances; and of which more than one half was &s;upplied by the French We&s;t-Indies. Out of 17, 142, 723 lbs. imported, 9, 321, 829 lbs. were received from that &s;ource. The re&s;idue came from the Dani&s;h, Dutch, and Briti&s;h dominions, in the following proportions, to wit: Dani&s;h, 2, 833, 016 lbs. Dutch 2, 707, 231 lbs. Briti&s;h 2, 280, 647 lbs. That &s;tatement was taken from the imports of 1790, the
<PB N="56" REF="027258_0055_0FD3F306B865AEE0">
only year he had been able to examine on this point.</P>
<P>It had been &s;aid, Why grant privileges before a mu|tual grant &s;hould be &s;ecured by po&s;itive &s;tipulation? Why throw away, by a legal regulation, what ought to be the price of treaty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">le an&s;wered, that the legal regulations threw nothing away, as it was always revo|cable: that in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, it was only meeting the legal regulations of which France had &s;et the exam|ple: that in&s;tead of being a bar to treaty, &s;uch a cour&s;e of proceeding, more than any other, would &s;mooth the way to it, by explaining the objects, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a confidence, on both &s;ides&mdash;that it would be happy, if in all ca&s;es, where treaties are in view, this open and con|ciliatory proce&s;s, could take the place of that re&s;erve and my&s;terious negociation, with which the parties ap|proach each other. Were Great-Britain de&s;irous of forming amicable arrangements by treaty, he a&s;ked what readier or more prudent &s;tep could &s;he have taken for the purpo&s;e, than to have followed the example &s;et her, by holding out in her laws, the &s;pirit in which &s;he was willing to meet us in negociation?</P>
<P>Having gone through the&s;e explanations, Mr. Madi|&s;on entered into a view of the principal objections to the re&s;olutions propo&s;ed.</P>
<P N="1">1. It was &s;aid they would dimini&s;h the revenue, and endanger the funds.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the public debt, his general ideas had been expre&s;&s;ed by &s;everal who had &s;poken before him. He acknowledged that he had di&s;liked and oppo&s;ed the modification given to it; but after it had received the &s;anction of law, he had entertained no other wi&s;h on the &s;ubject, than that the debt might be honorably di&s;charg|ed as fa&s;t as the circum&s;tances of the country would permit. This he was well &s;atisfied was the prevailing &s;entiment of the great body of the people. He did not believe, that there was a &s;ingle &s;tate in the union, or any con&s;iderable part of a &s;ingle &s;tate, that did not acquie&s;ce (where they did not approve) in the provi&s;ions which had been made in behalf of the public croditors. At the &s;ame time, he was equally &s;ure, that it never was either meant by Congre&s;s, or under&s;tood by the public, that
<PB N="57" REF="027258_0056_0FD3F308B6E65DF8">
in mortagaging the impo&s;t for their &s;ecurity, it was t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be an ho&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">age to foreign countries for our unqualified acquie&s;cence in their unequal laws, and to be worne, as long as the debt &s;hould continue, as a badge of nati|onal humiliation. The nature of the obligation could certainly import no more in favor of the creditors, than that the fund appropriated &s;hould be applied, as far as requi&s;ite, to their u&s;e; unle&s;s equivalent funds &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted; nor more again&s;t the public, than that all deficiencies in the funds &s;hould be made up, whether ari&s;ing without, or in con&s;equence of, a change in the laws. If it &s;hould happen, then, that in con&s;equence of any mea&s;ure, dictated by the general good, the impo&s;t &s;hould become inadequate to its object, all that could be exacted by the public creditors, would be &s;ome other provi&s;ion that would &s;upply the defalcation; and it ought not to be doubted, that the people at large, who&s;e good was pur&s;ued, would readily &s;upport whatever other provi&s;ion might become indi&s;pen&s;ible. He had made the&s;e remarks, however, with reference to an event, which he did not by any means admit to be probable. The more he had revolved the &s;ubject, the more clear|ly it appeared to him, that a very operative addition might be made to the duties on the enumerate articles, without endangering the aggregate product of the im|portations. And he entirely concurred in opinion with tho&s;e who had ob&s;erved, that the greate&s;t injury which could be done to the cla&s;s of citizens holding the pub|lic paper, was to repre&s;ent their interests as more to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> regarded than any national con&s;iderations whatever; and to oppo&s;e to the latter, even the mo&s;t imaginary contingences to the former.</P>
<P N="2">2. It was objected, that the operation of the re&s;olu|tions would be more favorable, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to nations in treaty than was merited; and more unfavor|able, in others, to nations not in treaty, than was po|litic.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this abjection, he ob&s;erved, that Swe|den and Pru&s;&s;ia, two of the nations in commercial treaty, had but little intercour&s;e with us; would be in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w. re&s;pect but little affected; and, be&s;ides, the treaties

<P>France and the United Netherlands, the two other nations to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not rea&s;onably be grudged the advantage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> might derive from treaties, for which we had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> go received a valuable con&s;ideration in their a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our in|dependence.</P>
<P>As to the nations not in treaty&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Denmark</HI> would not be affected. She had no navi|gation act, within the de&s;cription of the re&s;olutions; and could not feel the duties on manufactures. The whole of the imports from Denmark amounted in the year 1791 to 9,957 dollars only. Her i&s;lands al&s;o, with which the trade is carried on in our ve&s;&s;els, depend for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence on our market.</P>
<P><HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> has little or no &s;hipping in our trade, and it would not be effected if &s;he had; as &s;he has no &s;uch na|vigation act. Her <HI>unwrought</HI> iron may come as before. Duck and &s;heeting are the only two manufactures on which the re&s;olutions would &s;en&s;ibly operate; and with re&s;pect to the&s;e, as will pre&s;ently be ob&s;erved, it would be ea&s;y to make &s;pecial exceptions.</P>
<P><HI>The Han&s;e Towns,</HI> having no navigation act, would not be affected in that re&s;pect. Linens are the only articles falling within the propo&s;ed enumeration; and might, if thought requi&s;ite, be ea&s;ily excepted.</P>
<P><HI>Spain,</HI> has little &s;hipping in our trade; has no nagi|gation act, &s;uch as is to be reciprocated; and would not be &s;en&s;ibly touched by the duties on manufactures. She al&s;o needs our exports, and will be influenced by that con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>It had been a&s;ked, why Spain, again&s;t whom we had complaints as well as again&s;t Great-Britain, ought not to be equally an object of our regulations? He &s;aid that &s;uch a que&s;tion could be be&s;t an&s;wered when the com|munications from the Pre&s;ident relating to Spain, &s;hould be taken up.</P>
<P><HI>Portugal,</HI> like Spain, will not be affected in her na|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igation; nor &s;en&s;ibly, if at all, in the article of manu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ctures; and is, more than Spain, &s;upplied with nece&s;|&s;aries

It is certain that &s;he depends much on external re&s;ources, and that occa&s;ions are frequent when &s;he can find them no where el&s;e than in the United States.</P>
<P>Mr. Madi&s;on &s;aid, he con&s;idered the&s;e explanations as a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to the objection. He would add, however, that there were other an&s;wers, &s;ome of which had been before hinted, that would afford an option of modes for the exemption of nations not in treaty.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the opportunity which &s;uch nations have of removing all difficulties, by meeting us in liberal trea|ties, they may be provided for; either by limiting every part of the mea&s;ure to nations having a navigation act: Or by limiting it to nations within a geographical de&s;crip|tion; a practice familiar to the Briti&s;h code: Or by naming the nations to be excepted; a practice al&s;o fami|lar to Great-Britain: Or by naming the particular ar|ticles, to be excepted; a practice no le&s;s familiar to that nation.</P>
<P>By &s;ome or other of the&s;e modifications the commit|tee could be at no lo&s;s to accommodate the plan, to their own &s;en&s;e of propriety, and the public good.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Madi&s;on took occa&s;ion to remark, that much of the argument again&s;t the re&s;olutions, had pro|ceeded from an inattention to their import, and would be an&s;wered by a &s;imple explanation of them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t re&s;olution, which was immediately the &s;ub|ject of debate, decided nothing with re&s;pect to a di&s;cri|mination between different nations. It declared only, in general, that the &s;ituation of the United States re|quired &s;omething to be done, in the way of commercial re&s;trictions and duties. And yet it had been combat|ed by many members, as if a vote in favor of it would involve all the enbarra&s;&s;ing preferences which their fan|cies could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding re&s;olutions on the &s;ubject of addition|al duties on manufactures, and of a variation of the ton|tage duties, were founded on a di&s;crimination between nations in treaty, and nations not in treaty; but admit|ted,
<PB N="60" REF="027258_0059_0FD3F30D40DE5210">
as he had ob&s;erved, of whatever modifications or exceptions, might be judged equitable orpolitic. The propo&s;ed reduction of the tonnage of ve&s;&s;els in treaty, had been &s;ugge&s;ted by the complaint made by France of the exi&s;ting tonnage on her ve&s;&s;els, as exceeding the burden impo&s;ed by her on ours, as well as an unkind return for the commercial benefits of which the United States were partaking under her laws. At pre&s;ent the tonnage impo&s;ed by us, on all foreign ve&s;&s;els was the &s;ame. This would not &s;eem to be right on any prin|ciple, unle&s;s the tonnage impo&s;ed on our ve&s;&s;els, by all foreign nations, was the &s;ame, which was not to be pre|&s;umed. Whether the change he had propo&s;ed, would be an amendment of the exi&s;ting law, was a point to be examined. It was certainly a part of the plan which he did not regard as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the re&s;olutions reciprocating navi|gation laws, it was evident, he &s;aid, that the&s;e had no reference to the que&s;tion, whether a nation were in a treaty or not. They would operate equally, where|ever there might be the &s;ame departure from the princi|ple of reciprocity. If they &s;hould bear on one nation particularly, it would be becau&s;e they ought to do &s;o.</P>
<P N="3">3. It had been much in&s;i&s;ted, that trade ought to be free to find its proper channels, under the conduct of merchant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; that the merchantile opinion was the be&s;t guide, in the ca&s;e now depending; and that that opin|ion was again&s;t the Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er to this objection, he &s;aid, it was obvious to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that in the very terms of the propo&s;ition, trade ought to be <HI>free,</HI> before it could find its proper channel. It was not free at pre&s;ent, it could not, therefore, find the channels in which it would mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly flow. The dykes mu&s;t be broken down before the wa|ters could pur&s;ue their natural cour&s;e. Who would pretend, that the trade with the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies, or even with Great-Britain her&s;elf, was carried on under the pre&s;ent re&s;trictions, as it would go on of it&s;elf, if un&s;ette<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed from re&s;trictions on her part, as it is on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

<P>It &s;eemed to have been forgotten, that the principle of this objection &s;truck at every regulation in fever of manufactures, as much, or even more, than at regula|tions on the &s;ubject of commerce. It required the every &s;pecies of bu&s;ine&s;s ought to be left to the &s;agacity and intere&s;t of tho&s;e carrying it on; without any inter|ference whatever, of the public authority, He was him&s;elf, in general, a friend to this theory: but there were a variety of exceptions to it, ari&s;ing out of particu|lar &s;ituations; as mu&s;t be admitted by all who would mingle practical with theoretic views; and as has been already decided by a number of our laws.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the mercantile opinion, he was di&s;|po&s;ed to pay all due attention to it. The mercantile cla&s;s of citizens was certainly an enlightened and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> re&s;|pectable one. Their information ought always to be received with re&s;pect, and their intere&s;t protected with care. But it did not follow that their opinion, even on que&s;tions of trade, ought to be con&s;ulted as an oracle, by tho&s;e who were equally bound to watch over the in|tere&s;ts of every cla&s;s or citizens, and over the joint con|cerns of the whole. There were con&s;iderations of different kinds which &s;ugge&s;ted caution on this &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>However intelligent and con&s;tant the merchant might be, in directing his operations, for commercial purpo&s;es, he might not be equally in the habit of com|bining with the&s;e, the various other national objects which the Legi&s;lature might be bound to con&s;ult.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t of the mercantile cla&s;s may happen to differ from that of another cla&s;s; and po&s;&s;ibly both may differ from that of the whole community. For exam|ple; it is, generally &s;peaking, the intere&s;t of the mer|chant to import and export every thing: the intere&s;ts of manufacturers to le&s;&s;en imports in order to rai&s;e the price of dome&s;tic fabrics, and to check exports, where they might enhance the price of raw materials. In this ca&s;e it would be as imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oper to allow the one to
<PB N="62" REF="027258_0061_0FD3F3104F6C7C80">
judge for the other, as to allow either to judge for the whole.</P>
<P>It may be the intere&s;t of the merchant, under particular circum&s;tances, to con&s;ine the trade to its e&s;tabli&s;hed chan|nels; when the national intere&s;t would require tho&s;e chan|nels to be changed or enlarged. The be&s;t writers on political oeconomy have ob&s;erved, that the regulations mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nfriendly to the national wealth of Great Britain, have owed their birth to mercantile coun&s;els. It is well known, that in France, the greate&s;t oppo&s;ition to that liberal policy which was as favorable to the true inter|re&s;t of that country as of this, proceeded from the in|tere&s;t which merchants had, in keeping the trade in its former cour&s;e.</P>
<P>If, in any country, the mercantile opinion ought not to be im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">citly followed, there were the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons why it ought not, in this. The body of mer|chants who carry on the American commerce, is well known to be compo&s;ed of &s;o great a proportion of indi|viduals who are either Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, or trading on Briti&s;h capital, or enjoying the profits of Briti&s;h con|&s;ignments, that the mercantile opinion here, might not be an American opinion; nay, it might be the opi|nion of the very country of which, in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance at lea&s;t, we ought not to take coun&s;el. What the genuine American mercantile opinion would be, if it could be collected apart from the general one, Mr. Ma|di&s;on &s;aid he did not undertake po&s;itively to decide. His belief was, that it would be in favor of the re&s;olu|tions.</P>
<P>It could &s;carcely be nece&s;&s;ary, he &s;aid, to add, that his remarks were not meant to be, as they were not in fact, the lea&s;t reflection on any part of the mercantile order among us. They only &s;uppo&s;e, what in political rea|&s;onings ought always to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the prejudices of birth and per&s;onal intere&s;ts will be a bias on the judg|ment.</P>
<P N="4">4. It had been an objection to the re&s;olutions, that they might deprive us of the aid of Briti&s;h capital and credit, which were nece&s;&s;ary to the pro&s;ecution of our commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="027258_0062_0FD3F311C4F69970">Mr. Madi&s;on did not admit, either that the effect would happen, or that it would be runious to our com|merce.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s Great-Britain &s;hould, of her own choice, put a &s;top to the commercial intercour&s;e with us, which, for rea&s;ons before given, would be &s;o much more hurtful to her&s;el&s; than to this country, that it never could be pre&s;umed; the re&s;olutions would operate only by abridging &s;ome of our importations, and by varying the channels of others. Her capital, as far as requi|&s;ite here, might continue to be employed here.</P>
<P>On the general que&s;tion concerning our dependance on Briti&s;h capital and credit, he ob&s;erved, that it could not be denied that more u&s;e was made of them at pre|&s;ent, than was either nece&s;&s;ary or beneficial. Credit, when extended to con&s;umers, as was the ca&s;e through|out the &s;outhern &s;tates, was extremely injurious; as had been well explained by a member of Virgima (Mr. Nichols) and as he him&s;elf had equally witne&s;&s;ed, When confined to merchants, it might, within certain limits, be an advantage; but it was not only his own opinion, but that of better judges, that the credit given to our merchants, was, at pre&s;ent, exce&s;&s;ive and injurious.</P>
<P>In order to form a very, preci&s;e judgment on this &s;ubject, it would be nece&s;&s;ary, he &s;aid, to calculate the amount of our own capital, and its proportion to the amount of our trade. This was a thing, he &s;uppo&s;ed, which could not well be done. If he had concurred in the doctrine, of which &s;o much had been heard, both within and without doors, that a &s;unded debt and banks of di&s;count, were equivalent to active capital, he &s;hould have a ready an&s;wer to the difficulty. The paper of the two kinds in the United States, cannot amount to le&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> one hundred millions of dollars; whil&s;t the amount of our exports or our im|ports, does not exceed one fourth of that capital.</P>
<P>It is true, a part of both the public and the bank &s;tocks, is in foreign hands; but with the mo&s;t ample de|ductions on that account, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">adu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, if operating in any con&s;iderable degree as active capital, would be a competent re&s;ource.</P>
<P>As he did not however view the doctrine in the par|ticular

light in which it had been painted; it would be more to his purpo&s;e, to ob&s;erve, that there was certain|ly in this country a real mercantile capital to a very re&s;pectable amount&mdash;that this was fa&s;t increa&s;ing with our increa&s;ing population and wealth&mdash;that if the for|eign capital of one country &s;hould be withdrawn, the vacancy would probably, by degrees, be occupied by that of other foreign nations; that if it &s;hould happen otherwi&s;e, there was rea&s;on to believe, that a re&s;triction of our u&s;e of foreign credit, would be rather &s;alutary than di&s;advantageous; that in fine, as long as we had twenty millions of dollars worth of produce, wanted by other nations, and were willing take for it, twenty millions worth of what they wi&s;hed to part with, he was under no apprehen&s;ion that the means of effectuat|ing an exchange, would not be found. Both mer|chants and capital would quickly be generated by &s;uch a &s;tate of things, if they did not previou&s;ly exi&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">5. It had been ob&s;erved by &s;everal members, in al|lu&s;ion to the alledged proportion of Briti&s;h manufactures con&s;umed by us to the entire ma&s;s of her manufactures, that Great-Britain would never part with her naviga|tion act, in order to avoid a lo&s;s of four per cent, in the demand for her manufactures.</P>
<P>To this objection he an&s;wered, that the compari&s;on ought to be of our con&s;umption, not with the entire ma&s;s of her manufactures, but with the part entering into her foreign trade; and then the lo&s;s would not be four per cent, but, at lea&s;t twenty per cent; that this would not be the only lo&s;s &s;he would &s;u&s;tain, if &s;he &s;hould be unwi&s;e enough to &s;top the intercour&s;e between the United States and her dominions; that it had been al|ready &s;hewn, that when, &s;he apprehended a re&s;trictive &s;y&s;tem on our part, &s;he was willing to prevent it, by re|laxing her re&s;trictive &s;y&s;tem; that in times of war, when an adherence to that &s;y&s;tem would di&s;tre&s;s her, &s;he frequently &s;u&s;pends her navigation act; that at this moment it is &s;u&s;pended in relation to the We&s;t-Indies; that there could be little doubt if the temporary nece&s;|&s;ity were likely to be made permanent by firm and ju|dicious mea&s;ures on our part, that the remedy, for it would be made permanent al&s;o.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="65" REF="027258_0064_0FD3F31525AFE360">6. It was objected that the pre&s;ent was an improp|er time for &s;uch re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>The principal rea&s;on given for this was, that the negociation between the &s;ecretary of &s;tate and the Bri|ti&s;h mini&s;ter here, was &s;till depending. To &s;hew that this rea&s;on was un&s;ound, Mr. Madi&s;on went into an hi&s;torical view of what had pa&s;&s;ed in reference to com|mercial arrangements. Heread the me&s;&s;age of the Pre|&s;ident to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, on the 14th of February, 1791, acquainting them, that &s;teps had been taken to a&s;certain the di&s;po&s;itions of the Briti&s;h court on the &s;ubject, and that there was no ground for favor|able expectations. He &s;tated that in con&s;equence of this communication, a committee was appointed, who reported that foreign ve&s;&s;els ought not to be allowed to bring into the United States any articles not of the pro|duce or manufacture of the country to which they belong, and that an additional duty of twelve and an half<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eents ought to be laid on all di&s;tilled &s;pir|its, the production of any country or place from which ve&s;&s;el of the United States were not permitted to bring them; that it being very near the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, when this report was made; it was referred to the &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate, with an in&s;truction to report to the next &s;e&s;&s;ion an account of the foreign commercial regula|tions affecting the United States, with his opinion, &amp;c. that at the next &s;e&s;&s;ion; a letter was received from that officer, intimating that in the actual &s;tate of circum|&s;tances, the report would not be given in; unle&s;s called for by the Hou&s;e; that at the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, the report now before the committee, was given in, without being called for; and was therefore a proof, that the circum|&s;tances which had cau&s;ed the delay, had vani&s;hed, and that at pre&s;ent there was nothing in train, according to the opinion of the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, which ought to re&s;train the Legi&s;lature from proceeding in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>

recu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red to the pa&s;&s;ages which related to this point, He read from the fir&s;t letter of Mr. Jeffer&s;on to Mr. Hammond, dated Nov. 29, 1791, a paragraph reque&s;t|ing Mr. Hammond "To &s;ay, whether he was authori&s;|ed to conclude, or to negociate arrangements with us, which may fix the commerce between the two countries on principles of reciprocal advantage?" To this reque&s;t, Mr.Hammond, on the 30th of Nov. 1791, an&s;wered, "That the king was &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to promote and facilitate the commercial intercour&s;e between the two countries, and that he was authori&s;ed to communi|cate to this government, his maje&s;ty's readine&s;s to enter into a negociation for e&s;tabli&s;hing that intercour&s;e upon principles of reciprocal benefit. On Dec. 6, he wrote to Mr. Jeffer&s;on in order to prevent mi&s;apprehen|&s;ion, that although he was not yet empowered to CON|CLUDE any definitive arrangement with re&s;pect to the commercial intercour&s;e, he &s;till meant it to be under|&s;tood, that he was fully authori&s;ed, to ENTER into a ne|goication for that purpo&s;e, &amp;c. The reply of Mr. Jeffer&s;on on the 13th of Dec. informed Mr. Hammond, that he had laid letters before the Pre&s;ident, and was ready to receive a communication of his full powers, for entering into the negociaion, &amp;c. This was followed on the next day by a letter from Mr. Hammond, &s;tating, That he had no &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion, to CONCLUDE any <HI>de|finitive</HI> arrangement upon the &s;ubject of commercial intercour&s;e&mdash;but that he conceived him&s;elf fully com|petent to enter into negociation, and the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of principles that might be the ba&s;is of &s;uch definitive ar|rangement &mdash;and that this opinion of his competency was founded on the in&s;tructions which were to regulate his per&s;onal conduct, and the general <HI>plenipotentiary</HI> character in which he had been &s;ent and received.</P>
<P>This letter, Mr. Madi&s;on ob&s;erved, clo&s;ed the cor|re&s;pondence on the &s;ubject of commercial arrange|ments, being ju&s;tly con&s;idered by the executive as a final proof, that the powers of Mr. Hammond were in|competent, and irrelative to the object; and that it would be improper to open a formal negociation with him, under them. His in&s;tructions might be a rule and
<PB N="67" REF="027258_0066_0FD3F317F8D47640">
a warrant to him&s;elf, but not being even exhibited, could be no evidence of his authority, to the executive. And his plenipotentiary commi&s;&s;ion in the ordinary form, could never be under&s;tood as relating to the &s;pecial objects he propo&s;ed to di&s;cu&s;s. According to the u&s;age of nations, a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion is, in &s;uch ca&s;es, al|ways furni&s;hed and required. Mr. Madi&s;on was per|&s;uaded, that no &s;overeign in Europe would li&s;ten for a moment to &s;uch a claim as that of Mr. Hammond, and that the Briti&s;h court would have been offended at &s;uch an one from an American mini&s;ter. He thought there|fore, that the executive had equally con&s;ulted dignity and prudence, in &s;ilently dropping the &s;ubject in the manner they did, until Mr. Hammond &s;hould receive and produce adequate powers in the accu&s;tomed form; as might rea&s;onably be expected, if his court was duly di&s;po&s;ed to meet the United States, in an amicable ar|rangement of commerce by treaty.</P>
<P>That the con&s;truction put by Mr. Hammond on his powers, was inadmi&s;&s;ible, appeared to Mr. Madi&s;on to re&s;ult from the con&s;truction it&s;elf. Either the general Plenipotentiary commi&s;&s;ion was to be taken in the technical and limited &s;en&s;e in which it is applied to the ordinary diplomatic objects of a &s;tationary public min|i&s;ter; or in a literal &s;en&s;e, without regard to &s;uch limi|tation. In the former &s;en&s;e, it clearly does not extend to negociations for a treaty. In the latter &s;en&s;e it would ex|tend to the <HI>conclu&s;ion</HI> of a treaty, and not merely to <HI>ne|gociation,</HI> as Mr. Hammond explains and limits it.</P>
<P>Mr. Madi&s;on adverted next to the &s;tate of the corre&s;|pondence relating to the treaty of peace. It appeared, he ob&s;erved, that as long ago as the 29th of May, 1792, the Secretary of State had addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Hammond, a full explanation of our rights and demands, under that treaty&mdash;that on the 2d of June, Mr. Hammond in|formed the Secretary, that he &s;hould tran&s;mit it with|out delay for the con&s;ideration of his court; and ac|cordingly did forward it in the cour&s;e of a few days; that on the 13th Nov. 1793, previous to the pre&s;ent meeting of Congre&s;s, Mr. Hammond was de&s;ired by the Secretary, in pur&s;uance of a charge from the Pre|&s;ident,
<PB N="68" REF="027258_0067_0FD3F3193682DD50">
to let him know whether an an&s;wer could yet be given to the letter of May 29, 1792. Mr. Hammond re|plied, that it could not, but that he was confident t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e de|lay was to be a&s;cribed to the continuance of the cau&s;e alluded to in a former an&s;wer to a &s;imilar reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e alluded to, was the intere&s;ting po&s;ture of things in Europe, which it was &s;aid, had diverted the attention of the Briti&s;h government to objects of a more pre&s;&s;ing nature; and this con&s;ideration had been urged by &s;everal members, as an apology for the &s;ilence ob&s;erved towards the United States. Mr. Madi&s;on thought very differently. The interval between the receipt of the letter written by the Secretary in May, 1792, and the acce&s;&s;ion of Great-Britain to the war again&s;t France, had been &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e of preparing and &s;ending the proper in&s;tructions to Mr. Hammond. Mr. Madi&s;on added, that the pro&s;pect of being engaged in new controver&s;ies of a more &s;erious kind, in&s;tead of ju&s;tifying an inattention to an exi&s;ting one, ought to have quickened the efforts for a previous &s;ettlement of the latter. This is the cour&s;e dictated by prudence, to nations as well as to individuals; and where a right di&s;|po&s;ition concurs, it is the natural cour&s;e.</P>
<P>It had been mentioned as a further rea&s;on again&s;t the commercial propo&s;itions, at this time, that they might draw upon us the re&s;entments of the Combined powers. Mr. Madi&s;on could &s;ee no ground for &s;uch an appre|hen&s;ion. The Combined powers were pretty fully oc|cupied with France; they could have no pretext for concerning them&s;elves with us, in a ca&s;e where we did not concern our&s;elves with them; and there was the le&s;s room for imagining that the combination could mi&s;con&s;true the mea&s;ure into an offence again&s;t them, as two of the parties, Pru&s;&s;ia and the United Nether|lands, were in treaty with the United States, and are fa|vored by the propo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="7">7. It was finally contended, that admitting our &s;itu|ation to be &s;uch as had been de&s;cribed, the mode pro|po&s;ed was an objectionable one.</P>
<P>Mr. Madi&s;on &s;aid he had no predilections for the mode that could prevent his giving a ready preference
<PB N="69" REF="027258_0068_0FD3F31D8071FBB0">
to a better, if a better &s;hould be offered. And unle&s;s it &s;hould be &s;aid, that the Legi&s;lature ought to adjourn without doing any thing for the public relief, he thought it incumbent on tho&s;e who object to one propo&s;ition to &s;ub&s;titute another that would be le&s;s objectionable. By this he meant a propo&s;ition not merely better in it&s;elf, but one that would probably be thought &s;o, both withen and without doors; and be more likely to coincide with the &s;entiments of every part of the union, as well as to conciliate a majority of voices in the public councils.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion, he &s;aid, was whether any thing ought to be done. If this be decided in the affirma|tive, as he pre&s;umed to be the &s;en&s;e of the majority of the committee; and if war was not in contemplation as of cour&s;e was taken for granted; the next que&s;tion could only lie betwen negociation, and commercial regulation. Negocition it had been &s;hewn was in no train, or pro&s;pect, that could ju&s;tify reliance on it. Commercial regulations alone remained. They would be pacific in their operation. They were the means be&s;t &s;uited to the remper of our con&s;tituents. And he &s;incerely belived, that, if judiciou&s;ly framed, they would be more likely to an&s;wer the rea&s;onable purpo&s;es of the community, then any others that could be propo&s;ed.</P>
