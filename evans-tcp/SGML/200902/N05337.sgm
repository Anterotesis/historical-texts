<P>THE hearty Thanks you were plea&s;ed to return me for my Sermon preached by your De|&s;ire at the Opening of the Academy in <HI>January</HI> la&s;t, gave me a very &s;en&s;i|ble Plea&s;ure; nor had I then declined complying with your Reque&s;t to make it publick, had I not been of Opinion that my Mind, which was about that
<PB N="iv" REF="006754_0003_10298CC49CBCB080">Time much engaged in the nece&s;&s;ary Bu&s;ine&s;s of my Station, was not vacant enough to permit me to treat the Sub|ject with due Solidity and Correctne&s;s; and e&s;pecially as I had not of late been u&s;ed to this Sort of Compo&s;ition. But when I came to con&s;ider that a Detail was made of the Ri&s;e of the Acade|my, and of the &s;everal Matters propo&s;ed to be taught therein, and that it might be of great Service to publi&s;h this, in order to remove Mi&s;takes, and to en|able the Publick to judge of its U&s;eful|ne&s;s and Sea&s;onablene&s;s, I no longer he&s;itated to gratify you in the Publica|tion, confident that your Adoption and Patronage will procure it a fa|vourable Reception with my Fellow Citizens; and the Piety and Good|ne&s;s of the De&s;ign recommended in it, will prevail with others into who&s;e Hands it may come to overlook its nu|merous Defects.</P>
<P>IT affords no &s;mall Delight to eve|ry one who has the Succe&s;s of this Aca|demy at Heart, that though many
<PB N="v" REF="006754_0004_10298CC86178A250">Things promi&s;ed in this Di&s;cour&s;e re|main to be done, yet there is already much more effected than in &s;o &s;mall a Space of Time could have been rea&s;o|nably expected. The <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Ma&s;ters give entire Satisfaction; in|deed the Progre&s;s made by the Boys in both Schools is truly &s;urprizing; each has now the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of an U&s;her, made nece&s;&s;ary by the Number of Boys, who, notwith&s;tanding the Prevalence of the Small-Pox in Town, amount to above an Hundred. Ma|&s;ters are providing for teaching Wri|ting and <HI>French.</HI> The Mathematical School is daily increa&s;ing. A Charity School is e&s;tabli&s;hed. Proper Prayers are compo&s;ed for the Schools, and u&s;ed every Morning and Evening.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t do you the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay that much of this is owing to your Care, and the Regularity of your Vi&s;itations; and I have no &s;mall Satisfaction in be|ing able to be thus particular, &s;ince it mu&s;t needs be agreeable to the Publick to know that the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and

No &s;mall Benefit this to the Province! as in the&s;e are laid the proper Foundations for the higher Attainments in Learning, which will likewi&s;e be gone into, when the Difficulties of the Ma&s;ters, ari&s;ing from the preparing and cla&s;&s;ing &s;o many Boys as are daily admitted from different Schools, of different Proficiencies, and taught by different Methods, &s;hall a|bate.</P>
<P>THO' a good Beginning does not in&s;ure Succe&s;s in the Progre&s;s and Clo&s;e of the Work, yet it gives good Hopes that every one of the u&s;eful Purpo&s;es of the In&s;titutors will be gradually and &s;a|tisfactorily executed, and that in a Man|ner perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with, and accom|modated to, the Circum&s;tances of the Province; &s;o that tho&s;e who have hither|to entertained a Notion of the Un&s;ui|tablene&s;s of the In&s;titution to the Infant

<Q><BIBL>St. JOHN viii. 32.</BIBL>
<P>And ye &s;hall know the Truth, and the Truth &s;hall make you free.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF Slavery be de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed the wor&s;t and Liberty the be&s;t State Mankind can be pla|ced in, and Ignorance certainly leads to the the one, and Knowledge to the other: If, up|on the univer&s;al Acknowledgment of this Truth, publick Foundations for the Advancement of Learn|ing have been in&s;tituted by wi&s;e Men in all Coun|tries, and the&s;e Friends to Science have been re|warded with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing Honours: Then, my Fellow Chri&s;tians and Fellow Citizens, you have the greate&s;t Rea&s;on to expect the Appro|bation and Thanks of all good Men, on the Open|ing of this Academy for the In&s;truction of Youth in Piety, Virtue, and u&s;eful Knowledge.</P>
<P>AND &s;eeing our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who under&s;tood the Connection of Things perfectly well, has like|wi&s;e put his Seal to the Truth of the&s;e Sentiments, by joining Knowledge and Liberty &s;o clo&s;ely toge|ther in the Words of my Text, you may, with an humble Confidence, entertain favourable Hopes, that the Almighty will accept and hearken to your devout Prayers for his divine Ble&s;&s;ing and Counte|nance on your charitable Undertaking.</P>
<P>WHEN our Lord &s;poke the&s;e Words, <HI>Ye &s;hall
<PB N="2" REF="006754_0008_10298CD5AFBA46E8">know the Truth, and the Truth &s;hall make you free,</HI> he was in the Execution of an authentick and well evidenced Commi&s;&s;ion from the God and Father of all, to publi&s;h his la&s;t and greate&s;t Di&s;pen&s;ation; wherein Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, Reconciliation with his offended Maje&s;ty, Immortality and endle&s;s Glory, were promi&s;ed to all penitent Believers, in and thro' the Merits and Expiation of his Son's Death. This is the Truth, or Sy&s;tem of Truths, referred to in the Text, and by Chri&s;t more emphatically applied to the <HI>Jews,</HI> as what did completely &s;uper&s;ede the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Religion, and was of the mo&s;t certain Ef|ficacy to free them from the Servitude of Sin. But the Spirit of the Text reaches all Men, as well as the <HI>Jews,</HI> implying thus much, That the Chri&s;tian Religion calls upon its Profe&s;&s;ors to con&s;ider them|&s;elves as Children of God, and Members of Chri&s;t, and as &s;uch placed in this lower World in various Ranks and Stations of Life, and with different Ca|pacities and Talents, that each learning and doing his Duty here, might be advanced to the King|dom of Heaven hereafter; and if the Truths re|&s;pecting Man thus placed, and forming a Society, who&s;e Intere&s;ts in Chri&s;t Je&s;us are the &s;ame, be ge|nerally known, and have their proper Influence, then, and then only, is Man in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of true Liber|ty. <HI>Ye &s;hall know the Truth, and the Truth &s;hall make you free.</HI></P>
<P>Now, can any Thing more effectually prove the Nece&s;&s;ity and U&s;efulne&s;s of Education than this De|claration of our Saviour? Will not the Sy&s;tem of Truths contained the Go&s;pel remain &s;till in Dark|ne&s;s, unle&s;s the Knowledge of them be carefully taught, and the Minds of Youth early and faith|fully in&s;tructed in them? Is it not clear, from this Revelation, that Men, by doing their re&s;pective Duties in this World, afford God the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Proof of their Regard for his Laws, and make it
<PB N="3" REF="006754_0009_10298CDB6F601510">evident that the Go&s;pel has had its full Force and Effect upon their Souls? And pray, how can they be enabled rightly to di&s;charge the &s;everal Duties, Offices, Profe&s;&s;ions and Employments, made nece&s;|&s;ary by the Circum&s;tances in which the wi&s;e Provi|dence has put Matters here below, without an early Improvement of their Under&s;tandings, and a &s;uf|ficient Stock of Reading? Is the Knowledge of religious or civil Truths born with us; or does it come of it&s;elf? Mu&s;t it not be obtained with much Care and Labour; and, con&s;idering that we &s;tand in need of good In&s;tructors, with no incon&s;iderable Ex|pence?</P>
<P>THESE Que&s;tions an&s;wer them&s;elves, and &s;hew that Tho&s;e will be&s;t act up to the Spirit of the Text, and become the true&s;t Imitators of Chri&s;t, who employ their Wealth, Power and Influence, in the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Schools for the more ea&s;y and general Propagation of Knowledge; &s;ince, by do|ing &s;o, they do all in their Power that their Fellow Chri&s;tians may know the Truth, and that the Truth may make them free.</P>
<P>AND &s;urely there was never more Occa&s;ion to &s;hew our&s;elves worthy Chri&s;tians in this Sen&s;e than now; for whoever is in &s;uch a Station of Life, as requires frequent Intercour&s;e with our Inhabitants, mu&s;t every Hour &s;ee the deplorable Con&s;equences of a low and defective Education; and notwith&s;tanding all our Boa&s;ts of the Goodne&s;s of our civil Con&s;titu|tion, the Liberty allowed con&s;cientious Men in the Exerci&s;e of divine Wor&s;hip, the Accommodation of our Laws to the Circum&s;tances of the Colony, the Mildne&s;s and Lenity of the Government, the Fer|tility of the Soil, the Extent and flouri&s;hing Conditi|on of our Commerce; all which de&s;ervedly make us a con&s;picuous People; yet it does not require a more than ordinary Penetration to fore&s;ee, that if &s;ome Methods be not taken of giving a proper Edu|cation
<PB N="4" REF="006754_0010_10298CDF3A259AD8">to our Youth, the&s;e very Advantages and Privileges, for want of Knowledge, and a Capacity of exerci&s;ing the Offices nece&s;&s;ary for the Govern|ment of &s;o populous and indulged a Country, will run Things into Anarchy and Confu&s;ion; and, in a very little Time, perhaps &s;ome of us may live to &s;ee it, our Superiors may be forced to make Alterations in our Laws and Con&s;titution. The&s;e Con&s;iderations gave Birth to the De&s;ign of this academical In&s;titution, or rather Collection of &s;everal Schools, under the Tu|ition of one Ma&s;ter, and the In&s;pection of a Num|ber of the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Freeholders and Inhabi|tants of the City; not &s;o much to teach the learned Languages, for this is a &s;mall Part of Education, as to impart, in the lea&s;t expen&s;ive Manner, and in the be&s;t Order and Method, the Knowledge of religi|ous, moral and civil Truths, to all the Members of the Community, without Partiality or Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>AND if the Execution be equal to the good Inten|tion of the Tru&s;tees and Contributors, we may be ju&s;tly excu&s;ed, if we apply to the People of the Place the&s;e Words of our Saviour, tho' they were &s;poke by him on a much greater Occa&s;ion, <HI>Ye &s;hall know the Truth, and the Truth &s;hall make you free.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus evinced the Nece&s;&s;ity of a good E|ducation from the Meaning of my Text, and the pre&s;ent Situation of the Colony, I &s;hall, in the fur|ther Pro&s;ecution of my Subject, ob&s;erve the follow|ing Method.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall point out what Evils may be remedi|ed by Education.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall &s;hew that this Academy is well calculated to remedy the&s;e Evils.</P>
<P>AND, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> I &s;hall be&s;peak your Encourage|ment in favour of it.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t then,</HI> I have undertaken to point out what Evils may be remedied by Education. To make you &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e, be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, that the
<PB N="5" REF="006754_0011_10298CE0C4F349C8">Mind of Man, when he enters the World, is un|&s;tored with Knowledge; that he may, thro' Ne|gligence, acquire none, or a bad Sort; and that tho' he &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to lay in even a good Sort, yet it does not follow of Cour&s;e, that he will make u&s;e of his Acquirements, &s;ince his Temper may be bad, or he may be &s;o much indulged, and &s;o imprudently managed in his Youth, as not to profit by In&s;truction. Now, in all the&s;e Ca&s;es, as Happine&s;s re&s;ults from knowing Per&s;ons and Things to be what they are, and treating them accordingly, if we mi&s;s in either, we mu&s;t become unhappy. In&s;truction then is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; but this alone will not do; the Temper mu&s;t be diligently ob&s;erved, and diverted from the Evil it inclines to, which requires much Skill and Prudence; be&s;ides, the leading Inclinations or Genius of an opening Mind, ought to be as narrowly watched, as the Capacity, Memory and Judgment, and a &s;uita|ble Kind of In&s;truction adapted to them: Again, the State of the Affections, or what is in Scripture and common Language called the Heart, as well as the Head, mu&s;t be &s;tudied, and the&s;e in Conjunction &s;o regulated, that a good and u&s;eful Character may be formed out of them. It ought not to be the Ob|ject of the Concern of a Per&s;on entru&s;ted with Edu|cation, to &s;hew to the World &s;hining Parts, &s;o much as to in&s;ure to the ri&s;ing Generation the Exerci&s;e of the good Affections under the Direction of a com|mon Under&s;tanding. Now, in Proportion, as any of the&s;e are neglected, a Sett of Evils will nece&s;&s;a|rily &s;pring out of &s;uch Neglect. It &s;hall be my Bu|&s;ine&s;s therefore to &s;et the&s;e Evils to View with all the Clearne&s;s I am able, &s;o as from thence to evince the Nece&s;&s;ity of committing Children to the Care of Men of Knowledge, Prudence and Skill, independent of Parents and Relations, who&s;e Par|tiality and Indulgence render them unfit to be tru&s;ted
<PB N="6" REF="006754_0012_10298CE461833D28">with the &s;ole Care of their Childrens Education: And I chu&s;e to take this Method rather than any other; becau&s;e Evils, ju&s;tly repre&s;ented, make &s;tronger Impre&s;&s;ions, and &s;timulate the Mind to an immediate Application of the proper Remedies.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Train of Evils, which pre&s;ents it&s;elf to my examining View, flows from <HI>Ignorance,</HI> which mu&s;t inevitably be the State of an uncultivated Mind. Methinks I &s;ee one of this Cla&s;s with great Simplicity entering upon the Stage of Bu&s;ine&s;s, un|acquainted with him&s;elf, his Neighbours, and the World. He makes but a very flow Progre&s;s, ever timorous and diffident of him&s;elf, and jealous of every Body el&s;e. He &s;oon comes to one of tho&s;e material Occurrences of Life, where it is nece&s;&s;ary to come immediately to &s;ome Determination, and act with Spirit, or the Opportunity &s;lips, and never comes again. Methinks I behold him ballancing, and in Diffidence: Letting the golden Opportunity &s;lip: Taking Things by the wrong Handle: Mi|&s;taking his Intere&s;t: Pur&s;uing the wor&s;t Cour&s;e, and merely thro' want of Knowledge falling into a Va|riety of Evils, one Di&s;a&s;ter bringing on another: And &s;o blundering on to the very End of his Life. I perceive many inclinable, and making &s;undry At|tempts to employ him, but &s;oon, very &s;oon, di&s;co|vering his Ignorance, they withdraw or grow di&s;o|bliged, till at la&s;t he becomes perfectly in&s;ignificant, and falls into ab&s;olute Contempt. Favour me with your Attention, whil&s;t I enter a little deeper into the Mi&s;chiefs attending Ignorance. If Per&s;ons of this Cla&s;s have no Property, they are only con&s;i|dered as other Animals, and no other E&s;timate is put upon them, than according to the Strength of their Sinews, and the Profit that may be made of it. If they have Property, they &s;oon confound it by ill-judg'd Pur&s;uits, or fall a Prey to the fir&s;t Man who has Di&s;honour enough to take Advan|tage
<PB N="7" REF="006754_0013_10298CE84C0E1328">of their Ignorance. But &s;uppo&s;e, thro' the Pride of Parents, or the Affluence of their For|tune, &s;uch ignorant Per&s;ons take upon them the Profe&s;&s;ions and Offices, by the undue Execution of which, Mens Lives, or Health, or Properties, may be greatly affected; what a &s;ad Scene of Confu&s;ion is here! What terrible Effects en&s;ue! Their Di&s;|grace and Ruin are in the End! But that is not all; before this ju&s;t Fate overtakes them, they have ru|in'd all about them; their Relations, Friends and Acquaintance, fall the fir&s;t Victims to their Mi|&s;takes, and then others promi&s;cuou&s;ly, as they have the Misfortune to fall in their Way.</P>
<P>FURTHER, in a State of Ignorance the rational Faculties of the Soul, for want of U&s;e, may be &s;o extremely weakened, as not to exert them&s;elves whil&s;t in Union with the Body. As Exerci&s;e gives Strength to the Nerves, and pre&s;erves the Health, &s;o Thinking &s;trengthens the Powers of the Mind, and promotes the Health of the Soul; but if Knowledge, its natural Food, be with-held, it falls into a paralytick State, and becomes unable to make any vigorous Efforts. All that magnetical Force in the Affections and Pa&s;&s;ions, by which the Soul is with Violence carried towards Information, Merit, Excellence, Virtue, Goodne&s;s, Elegance, Decorum, find no Place in an ignorant Mind; but in their Room one has the Mortification to behold a perfect <HI>Vis Inertiae,</HI> or inert Power. And when the Spirituality, Vigour and Emulation of the Soul is gone, to what a low State is the human Form de|graded? The divine Image is then &s;o impair'd, that the Soul can't be di&s;tingui&s;hed to be of cele&s;tial Ex|traction, and an Ally of the angelick Order.</P>
<P>THIS naturally brings me to the Ca&s;e of an ig|norant Man with re&s;pect to Religion, and with it I &s;hall clo&s;e this Branch of Evils.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="006754_0014_10298CF04842CEA0">
RELIGION being a Tran&s;action between the Soul and its Creator, nece&s;&s;arily requires a well informed Judgment. Here more than in any other Matter: <HI>The Eyes of the Under&s;tanding</HI> (as the Apo&s;tle ex|pre&s;&s;es it) <HI>mu&s;t be opened, that we may &s;ee what are the Hopes of our Calling, and what are the Riches of the Glory of our Inheritance in the Saints.</HI> Here all the Powers and Faculties of the Soul are to be exerted, and &s;hould therefore be well advi&s;ed. Here, as the Affections are to be in their mo&s;t vi|gorous and &s;prightly Exerci&s;e, the Excellencies and Perfections of the Supreme Being, towards whom they are to be exerci&s;ed, &s;hould be previ|ou&s;ly perceived by the Mind. Here a great Varie|ty of Truths offer for our clo&s;e&s;t Examination, founded on as great a Variety of Evidence: From whence a Sett of Principles mu&s;t be drawn, that mu&s;t appear indubitably conclu&s;ive, and by careful and frequent Meditation &s;o firmly rivetted in the Mind, as to &s;erve with Readine&s;s on all Occa&s;ions to combat the Diver&s;ity of religious Opinions em|braced in the World, or the Impotency and Per|ver&s;ene&s;s of our own Minds, ari&s;ing from our Mi&s;|conduct. If this be done with Care, and on the be&s;t In&s;truction, whil&s;t young, how many un&s;peak|able Comforts will i&s;&s;ue from it; and from how many &s;ad Evils &s;hall we be delivered? But if this is not done at all, or carele&s;ly, which mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e, where Men are ignorant, what Plea&s;ure do they lo&s;e, all of the be&s;t and mo&s;t affecting Sort! and to what an Aby&s;s of Unhappine&s;s may they be plunged! I &s;hall in&s;tance only in two Pa&s;&s;ions, and tho&s;e no incon&s;iderable Ones in the human Frame: I mean Hope and Fear. Hopes an ig|norant Man can have few or none, or at be&s;t of an unentertaining Kind. Hopes have for their Founda|tion enlarged Views of Men and Things, they reach forward by the Stretch of a well exerci&s;ed Under|&s;tanding
<PB N="9" REF="006754_0015_10298CF1D13E8148">into future and invi&s;ible Worlds, concluding, by Parity of Rea&s;on and Affection, corroborated by Revelation, that the &s;everal Ranks of intelligent Beings, up to the mo&s;t High JEHOVAH, love and e&s;teem good and virtuous Souls; and that there|fore they will be finally rewarded, tho' for the pre|&s;ent placed in this inferior World.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the ignorant Man, from what has been &s;aid of the Nature of Religion, will want the Chain of Rea&s;oning on which to &s;ix well grounded Hopes; yet his Fears remain entire, and will prove a Source of endle&s;s Unea&s;ine&s;s. There is a Gloom and Di&s;&s;atisfaction ever hanging on the Souls of ignorant Men; they may not indeed often think on religious Subjects, tho' this will depend much on Con&s;titution; but whenever they do, they are per|petually repre&s;enting the Almighty in an angry and di&s;plea&s;ed Form; and indeed there is too much Rea&s;on for this, where Ignorance is a Man's own Fault. Well, what Remedy do they apply? Why, for want of Judgment to di&s;cern what is the proper Object of the divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, in&s;tead of for&s;aking their Sins, the only Things that can pro|voke a righteous Governor, and becoming regularly pious and good in their Lives, the only Thing to which are annexed the Benefits of the Expiation and Reconciliation of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, they want to pacify their incen&s;ed Judge, by inflicting unworthy and prepo&s;terous Puni&s;hments on them&s;elves, or making a Compen&s;ation, if they are wealthy, by large Donations to pious and charitable U&s;es; and &s;o fall a Prey to avaritious and ambitious Pa&s;tors.</P>
<P>THE next Sett of Evils which occurs to me in the Examination of an uncultivated Mind, ari&s;es from the <HI>Mi&s;application of the Genius.</HI></P>
<P>WE are mighty apt to arraign Providence for the numerous Calamities with which this mortal Life abounds; would we, however, but think ever &s;o

<P>THE Multitudes of Geniu&s;es, forming in this new World, may be compared to Seeds of the fine&s;t Flowers, thrown at a Venture into the Ground, where they no &s;ooner take Root, and begin to ex|pand and &s;tretch their tender lengthening Fibres; where they no &s;ooner a&s;pire, and with an erect Straightne&s;s pu&s;h for the open Sky; but they find either the Earth hard and unyielding, or covered with Thorns, Briars and noxious Weeds, which hinder their vigorous Efforts. Is there no Lover of Nature near, to help to &s;often and temper the Soil, and take away the hard ob&s;tructing Cru&s;t of the un|favourable Earth, that they may put forth their rich variegated Colours, and fill the Air with their dif|fu&s;ive Fragrance? Alas, mo&s;t of them di&s;appear! and tho&s;e which come up, di&s;cover faint and foreign Colours, nor di&s;play their native Beauty, nor emit their aromatick Odour!</P>
<P>THUS, my fellow Citizens, ought you to repre|&s;ent to your&s;elves the State of the Infant Geniu&s;es of the Place: How many are totally lo&s;t thro' Idlene&s;s and Inactivity? How many are forced, as it were, in Oppo&s;ition to their natural Temper and Genius, into wrong Trades, Offices, Profe&s;&s;ions and Employ|ments; and, by the&s;e Means, become Objects of Want, Wretchedne&s;s and Mi&s;ery? What Num|bers offer to the &s;earching Eye, ever peevi&s;h and fretful, a Torment to them&s;elves and to all a|bout them, always unea&s;y, and perpetually &s;hift|ing their Ground? Their undi&s;cerning Neighbours can a&s;&s;ign no Cau&s;e for it; or if they do, attri|bute it to a Perver&s;ene&s;s of Temper. Alas! ex|amine clo&s;e, and you will find the Man is put to a wrong Bu&s;ine&s;s; he hates his Profe&s;&s;ion; he likes &s;ome other much better, and his Soul is perpetually hankering after the ab&s;ent Object of

The Expences of their Education are

<P>I therefore proceed to my &s;econd general Head, to &s;hew that the pre&s;ent Academy is well calculated to remedy the&s;e Evils.</P>
<P>THERE have, of late, been &s;everal Things of a publick Nature projected, and Companies form'd for carrying them into Execution within this Pro|vince, all under better Regulations, and attended with better Succe&s;s, than Schemes of the &s;ame Na|ture in other Places; and what is remarkable, they have all taken their Ri&s;e from the Citizens them|&s;elves, and have been brought to Perfection at their own Expence: Nor &s;hould it be concealed, that this pre&s;ent In&s;titution, tho' one of tho&s;e Kinds which generally have for their Founders &s;overeign Princes, or Branches of Royal Families, or Nobles of the fir&s;t Rank and Dignity, owes likewi&s;e its Being to a Sett of private Men, who, from a Sen&s;e of the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Seminary of Learning, &s;et them&s;elves, at the Clo&s;e of the War, &s;eriou&s;ly to think about One: Frequent were their Con&s;ultations, and various were their Senti|ments; at la&s;t they agreed on the general Heads, and confident of the Continuance of the publick Spirit of their Fellow Citizens, they ventur'd to publi&s;h their Propo&s;als relating to the Education of Youth in this Province; therein enumerating, by a Variety of Hints, the &s;everal Branches of Science, which, in their Opinions, might be comprehended in &s;uch an In&s;titution, &s;o as to make it abundantly more u&s;eful than any which had come to their Know|ledge: At the &s;ame time, having a Diffidence of
<PB N="16" REF="006754_0022_10298D0C52805018">their own Judgment and Ability, they placed in the Front of the&s;e Propo&s;als an Invitation to all Per|&s;ons of Learning, Under&s;tanding and Experience, to favour them with their Sentiments and Advice, as to the Parts of Learning to be taught; the Or|der of Study; the Method of Teaching; the Oeconomy of the School; or any other Matter of Importance to the Undertaking. This no &s;ooner appeared, than the Generality of the People, con|vinc'd of the Nece&s;&s;ity and Advantages of &s;ome &s;uch In&s;titution, became &s;ollicitous that one &s;hould be attempted; whereupon a Form of Con&s;titu|tions was immediately framed, &s;uch as was judg|ed to be be&s;t &s;uited to the pre&s;ent Circum|&s;tances of this Colony, with Liberty to alter, ab&s;tract or enlarge, as upon Trial it &s;hould be found mo&s;t &s;erviceable; Experience &s;hewing Defects and Mi&s;takes in the be&s;t concerted Schemes, and the Mutability of human Affairs &s;ometimes rendering it nece&s;&s;ary to make Alterations. After the&s;e were found to give general Satisfaction, Twenty-four Tru&s;tees, without Regard to Difference in religious Per&s;ua&s;ions, were appointed to carry them into Execution; Merchants, Artificers, &s;ome likewi&s;e of the learned Profe&s;&s;ions. On the Publication, all was &s;o well approved, that in a very &s;mall Space of Time the Sub&s;criptions aro&s;e to <HI>Eight Hundred Pounds</HI> a Year for five Years; a Genero|&s;ity truly amazing, and what mu&s;t convey a mighty advantageous Idea of the good Di&s;po&s;ition of all Orders of Men among&s;t us to promote the pub|lick Good, whenever a fit Occa&s;ion pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>THUS &s;ucce&s;sful, it became a Matter of Debate where to place the Academy, and many Argu|ments were offered for &s;ome Village in the Country as be&s;t favouring the Morals of the Youth, too apt to be corrupted by the bad Examples abounding in populous Cities: But when it came to be con&s;idered
<PB N="17" REF="006754_0023_10298D0DD969FF28">that it would take a large Sum to erect proper Buildings at a Di&s;tance from the City; that the Circum&s;tances of many of the Citizens would not admit of a di&s;tant Place on Account of the Ex|pence; that the Tru&s;tees were Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, who could not be ab&s;ent from their Habitations without much Inconvenience; and that the Suc|ce&s;s of the whole, under God, would, in a great Mea&s;ure, depend, whether in Town or Country, on the per&s;onal Care and Attendance of tho&s;e en|tru&s;ted with the Management, it was thought pro|per to fix it &s;ome where within the City; and the more &s;o, when the Minds of the Tru&s;tees of the Building, where we are now a&s;&s;embled, came to be imparted. The&s;e thoughtful Per&s;ons had been for &s;ome Years &s;en&s;ible that this Building was not put to its original U&s;e, nor was it in their Power to &s;et forward a Charity School, which was al&s;o a Part of the fir&s;t De&s;ign; and that it was more in the Power of the Tru&s;tees of the Academy than in theirs to do it; they therefore made an Offer to transfer their Right in it for the U&s;e of the Acade|my; provided the Debts, which remained unpaid, might be di&s;charged, and the Arrears of Rent on the Lot paid off. This was thankfully accepted, and a Conveyance executed; and on the Settlement of the Monies due on account of the Building, &s;ome of its Tru&s;tees even generou&s;ly forgave a con|&s;iderable Part of their ju&s;t Demands. Whil&s;t I am acknowledging their Merit, let me not forget to do Ju&s;tice to their ab&s;ent Co-tru&s;tee for his ready and hearty Concurrence, &s;ignified in his Letter to the Pre&s;ident on that Subject. How peculiarly fortu|nate was this, &s;ince, by the Largene&s;s of the Build|ing, the Academy is furni&s;hed out of one Part of it only, and that the &s;malle&s;t, with as many hand&s;ome and well proportioned Rooms for all the Schools, as if they had been built for the Purpo&s;e; and there
<PB N="18" REF="006754_0024_10298D0F7B908518">is &s;till left as much of that Part, where divine Ser|vice is performed, as will an&s;wer the original De|&s;ign; and as it is ready &s;eated, and adorned with a beautiful Ro&s;trum or Pulpit, it will likewi&s;e make a &s;pacious Oratory or Hall for publick Examinati|ons. To add &s;till to our good Fortune, &s;ome conti|guous Lots, and &s;mall Buildings on them, have fallen into the Tru&s;tees Hands, by Purcha&s;e, &s;ince the Conveyance of the large One; and with a little Alteration, one of the Edifices can be turned into a Charity School. The&s;e furni&s;h a large and unincum|bered Area for the Childrens Exerci&s;e, and on which, in Time to come, as the Academy Funds encrea&s;e, and when a regular College may be thought to &s;uit the Circum&s;tances of the Colony, there is Room to erect a commodious Square of Buildings to accommodate the Students with Apartments for Lodgings, and all other Conveniencies.</P>
<P>ON this advanced Situation of the Scheme, the Corporation taking into Con&s;ideration the nume|rous Advantages the City would reap by this Se|minary of Learning, to their Honour be it men|tioned, have voted <HI>Two Hundred Pounds</HI> to be paid to the Tru&s;tees in Hand, and <HI>One Hundred Pounds</HI> a Year for five Years; <HI>Fifty Pounds</HI> where|of they have appropriated to the U&s;e of the Cha|rity School, for in&s;tructing poor Children <HI>gratis</HI> in the Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and in Reading, Writing and Arithmetick; which School the Tru&s;tees intend to open the en&s;uing Year, not doubting but by the divine Ble&s;&s;ing on their Endea|vours, and the further Encouragement of good People, they &s;hall be enabled to carry it on to the great Advantage of the Publick, and Benefit of the poorer Sort. One of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Children is to be yearly cho&s;en out of the Charity School by the Corporation, and educated <HI>gratis</HI> in higher Learn|ing in the Academy.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="006754_0025_10298D11141EFC58">
THE &s;etting out only with a temporary Sub|&s;cription, was by many at fir&s;t di&s;liked, not expect|ing there could be found any Ma&s;ters of &s;ufficient Abilities, who would be willing to &s;erve on the&s;e Terms, but the Authors of the Propo&s;als judged otherwi&s;e of the Di&s;po&s;ition of Men of Letters, and were &s;anguine enough to pronounce, that when &s;uch &s;hould come to hear of the Spirit exert|ed on this Occa&s;ion, they would not be di&s;couraged by the Limitation of Time; but would natural|ly be led to think, if &s;o hand&s;ome a Sum, as <HI>Eight Hundred Pounds</HI> a Year, could be &s;o readily rai|&s;ed under &s;uch an Uncertainty of the Scheme's &s;ucceeding, there could be no Doubt, but if Pro|vidence &s;hould favour it with Succe&s;s, there would at the End of the Term, be a much better, and more durable Fund. Exclu&s;ive of this Rea&s;on|ing, it was judged that the Love of Mankind, ever in&s;eparable from &s;olid Knowledge, and true Learning, would engage the Per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them in its Favour. It fell out accordingly. A Gentleman of a neighbouring Province, when it was moved to him, as he was known to be well qualified to fill the Place of Rector, and <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Ma&s;ter, generou&s;ly clo&s;ed with the Pro|po&s;al without any Objection to the Limitation of Time, or Stipulation for a preci&s;e Sum to be gi|ven as a Salary, which could not then be fixed. This was a great deal, but &s;till much more was wanting. The Place of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ma&s;ter was thought to be of as much, if not more Con&s;equence, and it was not probable that any one equal to the Ta&s;k, and at the &s;ame time di&s;engaged, could be found in <HI>America:</HI> This made the Tru&s;tees unea&s;y, as they could not think of running the Ri&s;que of Recommendations of Per&s;ons from <HI>Eng|land,</HI> where, tho' the fitte&s;t Men might be procured, yet in ca&s;e of a Di&s;appointment, the Inconveniency
<PB N="20" REF="006754_0026_10298D1980485788">would not ea&s;ily be remedied. Whil&s;t under this Anxi|ety, two of the Tru&s;tees took a Journey to the Ea&s;tern Provinces, and being favoured with the Conver&s;ation of an eminent and learned Per&s;on, well known a|mong&s;t Men of Letters for &s;everal Improvements on the Method of Study, and acquiring the liberal Arts, he gave them Hopes of his per&s;onal vi&s;iting the Academy, which if he had done, they flattered them&s;elves that this Difficulty might have been re|moved; but Indi&s;po&s;ition, and &s;ome other unfore&s;een Accidents, deprived them of his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. In this Situation, Affairs remained till the other Day; when a Gentleman &s;aid to be an experienced In&s;tructor of Youth, and practically acquainted with the Me|thods u&s;ed in the be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Schools and Academies, arrived in this City; and on an accidental Relation made to him as a Stranger by one of the Tru&s;tees, of the State of the Academy, and of the Di&s;tre&s;s occa&s;ioned by the Di&s;appointment as to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ma&s;ter, he offered his Service to &s;upply the Place, till one could be provided. This made &s;uch an Im|pre&s;&s;ion on the Tru&s;tees, that they recommended it to the Rector to examine into his Abilities, and on his Report that he thought him well qualified, they engaged him for a certain Time.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter employed to teach the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> and the Sciences u&s;ually taught with them, is well known, having, for many Years, had a large School in Town. His School is furni&s;hed by the Tru&s;tees with a very valuable Sett of Mathematical In&s;truments of all Sorts, for the better In&s;truction of the Scholars in the U&s;e of them. The <HI>Grammar</HI> Schools are al&s;o provided with a Collection of the be&s;t <HI>Cla&s;&s;icks,</HI> for the U&s;e of the Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Thus the Academy opens with a Rector, and Ma&s;ters in the Schools, that are the mo&s;t material, and of the mo&s;t immediate and general U&s;e. One
<PB N="21" REF="006754_0027_10298D1CC2B855B8">Tutor is already provided in A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Rector on the Recommendation of a good Judge. More Tutors and U&s;hers will be added, as the Scholars encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>THO' it has been thought proper to give this Seminary of Learning the Name and Title of an Academy, yet it is more properly a Collection of Schools under one Roof, and the In&s;pection of the Tru&s;tees. And tho' only &s;uch Branches of Know|ledge, as are perfectly adapted to the Circum&s;tances of the Province, are for the pre&s;ent propo&s;ed to be taught in it, in which Re&s;pect its Advantage mu&s;t be con&s;iderable, &s;ince, if the Plan be &s;ucce&s;sfully exe|cuted, the&s;e will be taught in a much quicker and better Method, and at a much le&s;s Expence: Yet it is &s;o ordered, that with &s;uch Additions, as on Experience of its great U&s;e and Benefit may be rea&s;onably expected will be made to the pre&s;ent Fund, it may be improv'd into a Collegiate In&s;ti|tution, and every Kind of Knowledge be taught in it, that the mo&s;t reputed Univer&s;ities lay Claim to.</P>
<P>IT is no incon&s;iderable Part of the Plan, that whil&s;t the Pupils in the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Schools are taught the grammatical Con&s;truction of the Cla&s;|&s;icks, it is intended Lectures &s;hall be read to tho&s;e who are forward enough in their Learning, wherein the Subject Matter of each Author will be explained and illu&s;trated, and his Style, Spirit and Elegance, pointed out; &s;o that they may be appre|hended, ta&s;ted, admired, and, it is hoped, well imitated by the Pupils in their Compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>NOR is it propo&s;ed in the Childrens Exerci&s;es to pro|ceed by the Methods in ordinary U&s;e, which in gene|ral only con&s;ult the making <HI>Latin</HI> according to Gram|mar Rules, or the right Con&s;truction of an Author by them: But that Exerci&s;es, adapted to the Capa|city and Proficiency of the Scholars, &s;hall be compo|&s;ed
<PB N="22" REF="006754_0028_10298D1E4B5A8E20">by the Ma&s;ters, and con&s;i&s;t of Hi&s;tory, Mo|rals, and the plain Parts of Natural Philo&s;ophy; all which may, by the&s;e Means, be taught along with the Languages. Nor will this appear too difficult to them, who know what amazing Progre&s;s Boys may be brought to make in Knowledge, by proper Methods, and due Care on the Part of the Ma&s;ters. For In&s;tance, if before an Exerci&s;e be put into their Hands, the Subject be fairly opened, its &s;everal Parts explained, and then Que&s;tions propo&s;ed in the Pre&s;ence of the Cla&s;s, to one or more of the for|warde&s;t Boys, to try whether the Matter of the Exerci&s;e be clearly under&s;tood, or it may want to be &s;till further explained; if this is affectionately and judiciou&s;ly done beforehand, it is not to be imagined how much the Apprehen&s;ion may be quickened, the Memory aided, the Judgment in|formed, and, in a &s;mall Time, all the Faculties improved. The learned <HI>Tanaquil Faber</HI>'s Son, is an Example of this; for he, at fourteen Years of Age, had read mo&s;t of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Cla&s;&s;icks, and under&s;tood them perfectly well, as well as &s;everal other Parts of Learning. In the <HI>Latin</HI> School, the Ma&s;ters will likewi&s;e have it particularly in Charge to correct, refine and beautify our Mother Tongue, to the End that their Scholars may be enabled to under&s;tand it perfectly well, and to write it with Purity and Elegance. How much this is wanted, may be ea&s;ily judged, if it be con&s;idered, what a mean Figure many, who under&s;tand the learned Languages, make when they come to write in <HI>Eng|li&s;h;</HI> how aukward is their Mode of Expre&s;&s;ion; how forced and inelegant are their Compo&s;itions; and how difficult to be under&s;tood; tho' all the Rules of Grammar have been accurately ob&s;erved?</P>
<P>THIS Academy has this further Advantage; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language is propo&s;ed to be taught in a <HI>Grammatical Manner,</HI> and in a &s;eparate School, for
<PB N="23" REF="006754_0029_10298D2476876190">the U&s;e of tho&s;e who may not be inclined to learn <HI>Latin.</HI> The great Nece&s;&s;ity and U&s;e whereof will appear, if one con&s;iders to what an infinite Pain ingenious Per&s;ons, who &s;peak only their Mother Tongue, but are unacquainted with Grammar, and Propriety of Expre&s;&s;ion, are put, to write even on the mo&s;t common Subjects? It is pro|bable that many Di&s;coveries have been made of equal Importance, perhaps, with any known, and yet dropped or concealed by the Di&s;coverers, from their Apprehen&s;ions of incurring the Cen&s;ure of the World, and being put to Shame, for want of ju&s;t and proper Expre&s;&s;ions, thro' their Ignorance of Language to clothe their Sentiments; and tho' this is a fal&s;e Shame, yet &s;ince the Pain ari&s;ing from it, is as exqui&s;ite as the Plea&s;ure felt on the Commen|dations given to any One for a fine Style and ju&s;t Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, it is not to be wondered that it &s;hould take Place, e&s;pecially as the Minds of truly ingenious Men are generally very delicate on this Point.</P>
<P>As a further Proof of the Benefit of &s;uch a School, let it be con&s;idered, that was the Mind u&s;ed to form Words, and make written De&s;criptions of Things as &s;oon as the original Truths were impre&s;|&s;ed on the Brain, the Attention would be mightily quickened, the Judgment a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and the Memory greatly corroborated. Be plea&s;ed to a&s;k your&s;elves, how much oftener Names bring Per&s;ons and Things in|to your Minds than their Pre&s;ence? Ju&s;t &s;o it would be were general Propo&s;itions and u&s;eful Truths well de|&s;cribed, and the De&s;criptions carefully lodged in the Memory, which they would be much oftener than they are, did Men know how to commit them early and properly to Writing. A Man in Bu&s;ine&s;s, who makes Memorandums of what he does, has a va&s;t Advantage of the be&s;t Memory; it would be even &s;o, if he was to make Memorandums of the Truths proper to be known, or that come to his Know|ledge;
<PB N="24" REF="006754_0030_10298D27BAA7DE80">he would here al&s;o have the Advantage of the greate&s;t Readers of Books, who don't take this Method.</P>
<P>THIS is however what People in general think may be done by learning <HI>Latin,</HI> and for that Rea|&s;on, perhaps, as much as for the Advantage of know|ing the Language, give their Children a <HI>Latin</HI> Education; but it is really not &s;o, or not &s;o much &s;o as they imagine: For tho', when a Per&s;on learns <HI>Latin,</HI> the Rules of Grammar may be applied to his native Tongue, and in Effect a Man does, whil&s;t learning <HI>Latin,</HI> throw his Mother Tongue into grammatical Order, yet he does not gain a Com|mand, much le&s;s a Propriety of Expre&s;&s;ion: In|deed how &s;hould he, &s;ince every Language has its own Idioms, its own Phra&s;es, its own Copiou&s;|ne&s;s, Beauties and Elegance? The native Force and Energy of every Language is &s;o peculiar to it&s;elf, that it cannot be transferred into any other Language, without the Lo&s;s of the &s;pecifick Spirit. Make <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> &s;peak <HI>Latin,</HI> or <HI>Tully Greek,</HI> and you will &s;oon di&s;cover this. Try to turn <HI>Milton,</HI> or <HI>Pope,</HI> or <HI>Swift,</HI> into <HI>Latin, Greek,</HI> or any other Language. Let the <HI>Spectators</HI> be put into <HI>French</HI> by the fir&s;t Profe&s;&s;or of Eloquence in the Royal College, and you will not know them to be the &s;ame. 'Tis as impo&s;&s;ible as the Tran&s;mutation of Metals; and, as I apprehend, for this Rea&s;on, be|cau&s;e the Mother Tongue takes its Ri&s;e from Things them&s;elves, and from the different Lights in which Objects or Truths make their fir&s;t Entrance into the Mind. It is the fir&s;t and pure&s;t Tran&s;cript of Nature, which is ever conceived better from the Originals, as they fir&s;t appear to the Sen&s;es or the Mind on the Spot, and rai&s;e the Virgin Affections and Pa&s;&s;ions, than as they are apprehended by Per|&s;ons of other Countries, and clothed in foreign Expre&s;&s;ions. The Originals, whether the Works
<PB N="25" REF="006754_0031_10298D2946641FA8">of Nature or Art, Action, Character, or a Com|po&s;ition of &s;ome or all of them, rai&s;e the Ideas quicker and &s;tronger in the Brain, and con&s;equently their Impre&s;&s;ions are more natural and durable. Be|&s;ides, what is called Humour, that is, each Man's particular Mode of conceiving and telling Things, or of acting and behaving in the grave or lighter Concerns of Life, can be taken into the Mind no where but upon the Spot; and as there is a national as well as per&s;onal Humour, and this mixes more or le&s;s in almo&s;t every Narration, whether in Pro&s;e or Ver&s;e, and as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> People abound with this more than any other; it is the Duty of every <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Man to prefer and cultivate to the utmo&s;t his native Language, that he may enjoy all that Infinity of Plea&s;ure, which is derived from the Spirit, Li|berty, good Sen&s;e, and inimitable Humour of his Countrymen. Nor would I have this under&s;tood, as if it was &s;aid in Derogation of the <HI>Latin</HI> School. No; far from this, con&s;idering how great a Part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue is derived from the <HI>Latin;</HI> that all the Terms of Art and Science in the learn|ed Profe&s;&s;ions are taken from the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin;</HI> and that there is Abundance of u&s;eful Knowledge which can be acquired in no other Language; it is ab&s;olutely incumbent on tho&s;e who &s;tudy to capaci|tate them&s;elves for tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions, or who aim at a general Education and Acquaintance with Books, to gain a thorough Knowledge of <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek.</HI> Add to this, that the chief Part of the Sy&s;tem of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> School, which is to learn Youth to write and &s;peak it with Purity, is propo&s;ed to be u&s;ed in the <HI>Latin</HI> Schools, which will thereby be render|ed much better, and of more exten&s;ive U&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Newne&s;s and Peculiarity of this School made it nece&s;&s;ary to give a di&s;tinct Account of it: But what the Publick ought principally to be told, and to con&s;ider, is, that the pre&s;ent Mode of Educati|on
<PB N="26" REF="006754_0032_10298D2CB58399A8">is calculated to &s;ave Time, and, by good Order and Di&s;cipline, to fix in the Childrens Mind an early Sen&s;e and Love of Right and Decorum, of a mo|de&s;t and ju&s;t Behaviour. It is apprehended, that by the Methods propo&s;ed to be here u&s;ed, Know|ledge of Languages will be acquired much &s;ooner, and all the while good Principles may be in&s;tilled into the Soul; the Di&s;po&s;itions, if bad, corrected; if good, encouraged. The Boys may be made to love Learning, to crave it with Earne&s;tne&s;s, and to apply it to their Manners with Quickne&s;s. They may be brought to love their Ma&s;ters, and when the Childrens Affections are gained by tho&s;e who pre|&s;ide in the Schools, they may make &s;uch Di&s;tincti|ons, di&s;po&s;e of their Prai&s;es and Reproaches, of their Rewards and Puni&s;hments to &s;uch Advantage; as to make every Boy di&s;cern Right and Wrong, and engage all his Pa&s;&s;ions early on their proper Ob|jects. They may rai&s;e an inextingui&s;hable Emula|tion, &s;uch an ardent De&s;ire to excel, as &s;hall take the Lead of all the Pa&s;&s;ions. They may feed it with every worthy Character, recorded to have ap|peared either in former or later Times in every Part of the World. Pupils thus taught, will, of their own Accord, introduce a Sort of Honour and mo|de&s;t Preferment of each other into their very Diver|&s;ions; they will &s;corn to cheat, or over-reach, or take any undue Advantage, or u&s;e any over-bear|ing Treatment or Language, and whoever does, (tho' Accu&s;ations &s;hould not be encouraged) ought to be expo&s;ed. The principal Part of Education among&s;t the <HI>Orientals,</HI> old <HI>Grecians,</HI> and early <HI>Romans,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted in the Management of the Chil|drens Diver&s;ions, Exerci&s;es and Meals; the&s;e being thought of equal Importance with liberal Arts and Sciences. Manly and noble were their Exerci&s;es, their Appetites in perfect Subjection, and their Manners formed on the Rules of ju&s;t Courte&s;y and
<PB N="27" REF="006754_0033_10298D3028DFBAD8">rational Complai&s;ance. Pity they are not more imi|tated, as this would certainly promote Hardine&s;s, Temperance, Mode&s;ty, Emulation, Friendline&s;s, Openne&s;s of Temper, Genero&s;ity, a Sen&s;e of Ho|nour, and Love of Virtue.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould be well con&s;idered, how to make a ju&s;t Advantage of that u&s;eful Pa&s;&s;ion Shame, the Barrier of Virtue; for the Delicacy of its Nature is &s;uch, that tho' with good Management it may be of infinite A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Formation of the Childrens Manners, yet un&s;peakable Hurt may be done by an injudicious and too frequent Application to it.</P>
<P>CORRECTION likewi&s;e is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary; but it is propo&s;ed that this be admini&s;tred with the utmo&s;t Prudence and Caution, never whil&s;t under the Force or Effects of &s;udden Pa&s;&s;ion; gentle &s;hould be the Reproaches at fir&s;t; then, if not re|garded, louder and more pointed; and even if not then minded, it &s;hould be well con&s;idered, whe|ther it may be a proper Time to come to Extremi|ties; for on this depends the Pre&s;ervation of the Child; if they have their proper Effect, he is &s;a|ved, if not, he is ruined.</P>
<P>I re&s;erve to the la&s;t, as being of the mo&s;t Con&s;e|quence, that great Care ought to be taken to in&s;til into the Minds of the Children ju&s;t and &s;olid Notions of Religion. The Ma&s;ters will be in&s;tructed to have this always in their View, &s;ince every thinking Man mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that if the&s;e be neglected, all the other Parts of Education will avail little; it is there|fore propo&s;ed to begin and end with Prayers, to be made &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion; and this not as a Formality, but an Act of proper and nece&s;&s;ary De|votion to draw down the divine Ble&s;&s;ing on their Endeavours, without which they cannot expect Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="006754_0034_10298D3824DA4F98">
ON this Subject two Things occur to me wor|thy of Con&s;ideration, and &s;ome better Regulation than has hitherto been ob&s;erved. The fir&s;t relates to the &s;acred Name of GOD, and the other to the U&s;e of the holy Scriptures. As to the fir&s;t, great Care &s;hould be taken that when it occurs in School Exer|ci&s;es, it be pronounced with Reverence. Was that holy, tremendous and all perfect Spirit, &s;een with the Eyes of the Mind when his &s;acred Name is read, which would be the Ca&s;e, did Per&s;ons attend to what they read, the Heart would nece&s;&s;arily feel Venera|tion, Adoration and dutiful Regard, and we &s;hould &s;top a while at the divine Maje&s;ty of the Per&s;onage: Grave and religious Men actually do &s;o; tho&s;e emi|nent Philo&s;ophers Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> and Dr. <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> ne|ver u&s;ed this holy Name without a Pau&s;e, and a &s;hort mental Ejaculation of Adoration and Prai&s;e. Now as Children do not know what it means, if when it occurs, the Ma&s;ters pronounce it, and they be per|mitted to gabble it over in the &s;ame carele&s;s Man|ner as <HI>Mars,</HI> or <HI>Mercury,</HI> or <HI>Bacchus;</HI> from hence there will ari&s;e an habitual Irreverence, which may remain even when they know better. This there|fore &s;hould be avoided, and the Ma&s;ters u&s;e them|&s;elves to &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing Mark of Reverence when it is nece&s;&s;arily to be pronounced; and it may be of U&s;e in their Exerci&s;es, in&s;tead of the Name, to mention &s;ome Part of the divine Character, as <HI>the Creator or Governor of the World, the invi&s;i|ble eternal Spirit, the univer&s;al Parent, the Good Being, the All-powerful, All-knowing, All-direct|ing Spirit:</HI> Together with this cautious U&s;e of the Name, let particular Care be taken that worthy Sentiments of the Divine Supreme Being be by every po&s;&s;ible Method in&s;tilled into the Minds of the Scholars. Ab&s;tract Notions confound the Heads of Youth. His Exerci&s;e of Ju&s;tice, his Love of his Creatures, his Impartiality, and Delight in their Im|provement
<PB N="29" REF="006754_0035_10298D39AA745CC8">and Happine&s;s, mu&s;t be engraven on their tender Minds with great Clearne&s;s and Simplicity, &s;o as that their little Souls may be early taught to honour and love his Character. This adorable Be|ing ought to be &s;poke of with great Devotion, and with a &s;uitable Per&s;ua&s;ivene&s;s, as the affectionate and tender Parent of their Parents and them&s;elves, whom they ought to love, becau&s;e he loves them more than their natural Parents or Relations can do, and can di&s;po&s;e their own little Hearts aright, and in|fluence the Hearts of others in their Favour; and therefore they ought to be careful by Prayer and Goodne&s;s to engage his divine Maje&s;ty to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their Studies, and to give them Wi&s;dom, and to make them u&s;eful in the World. Heaven &s;hould be &s;poke of as a Place where JEHOVAH &s;its upon his Throne, and at a proper Time will call to him all &s;uch as have gone through their Studies with Di|ligence, and, in Virtue of a good Education, have faithfully di&s;charged their Duties in their re&s;pective Stations here below. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;hould be repre&s;ented as &s;itting at the Right-hand of the Throne of his Father, the Patron, Guardian, Protector, and the Head of the univer&s;al Church, and Lord of the Souls of Men, &s;ending the mo&s;t holy and ble&s;&s;ed Spirit to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;anctify them while in this lower World; and di&s;pen&s;ing immen&s;e Rewards and Pre|ferments to them, when by Death they &s;hall be tran&s;lated to a better.</P>
<P>THIS is to be the more earne&s;tly recommended to the Ma&s;ter, as the filial and dutiful Reverence of God, and the Exerci&s;e of the Affections towards him, is too too much neglected? Suffer me, tho' it may be deemed a Digre&s;&s;ion, to &s;ay &s;omething on &s;o intere&s;ting a Subject. What can make Ingratitude towards God a le&s;s Crime than towards our Fellow Creatures? Is it that this divine Spirit is not as free and as deliberate in the Di&s;tribution of his Favours
<PB N="30" REF="006754_0036_10298D3B347C8DD0">as Man is? When before the Creation there was an univer&s;al Blank, when nothing exi&s;ted of what our Eyes now behold, and the Almighty had under his Con&s;ideration, and within his Option, a great Va|riety of Beings, mu&s;t it not be perfect Choice, and the utmo&s;t Liberty of Action, to bring into Ex|i&s;tence any, and what Sort of Beings, he plea&s;ed? If then he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to form Man after his own Image, and in his own Likene&s;s, and to confer upon him the ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ings of Intelli|gence and Liberty, does not this infer an Obligati|on? And where an intelligent Being finds him&s;elf under an Obligation, is it not highly rea&s;onable to acknowledge it, and to return Affection for it? I &s;ay, does it not enter into the E&s;&s;ence of an Obligation, that the Per&s;on who confers it, knows the Value of the Favour conferred, and may withhold it if he plea&s;es? And if he does not withhold it, when at perfect Liberty to be&s;tow or not, does not this ne|ce&s;&s;arily engage the Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving of the Obliged? Does it make a Difference in Point of Af|fection and Duty, whether it be the Supreme or a &s;ubordinate Being who confers the Favour?</P>
<P>ON a fair An&s;wer to the&s;e Que&s;tions, Rea&s;on will pronounce, that as the Ab&s;ence of the good Affec|tions towards a proper Object is a great Fault, &s;uch Fault mu&s;t needs be the greater when the Object is mo&s;t de&s;erving; and con&s;equently we &s;hall do no Inju&s;tice to our Natures, if we place Irreligion and Indevotion among the mo&s;t odious Crimes.</P>
<P>AGAIN; Are not the good Affections among the natural Excellencies and Perfections of the divine Nature? Are they not the Source and Fountain from whence &s;pring &s;o many kind and good Providences towards his Creatures? Revelation expre&s;ly attri|butes them to GOD, nor think this is by Way of an indulgent Complai&s;ance to our weak Com|prehen&s;ions,
<PB N="31" REF="006754_0037_10298D3CC08721C0">but as the ju&s;te&s;t and true&s;t De&s;cription of the real Di&s;po&s;ition of the Almighty. Now if the Supreme Being be an affectionate and loving Spirit, and all his Grace and Favour to us accom|panied with Love, are we not, in this View of Things, extremely faulty, to remain without any Return of Love for him? No one who is really be|loved by another here below, can avoid the Con|demnation of his Heart, if his own Affections are not at the fame Time rai&s;ed towards him. The very Brutes, who di&s;cover Fondne&s;s for us, rai&s;e in us a Tenderne&s;s for them: Love &s;hewn by any of our own Species certainly kindles in every well di&s;|po&s;ed Brea&s;t, a warm Return of Affection:&mdash;Should not then, in the Eye of Rea&s;on, the Loving-kind|ne&s;s of the Lord kindle in our Brea&s;ts the greate&s;t and mo&s;t ardent Affection towards his divine Ma|je&s;ty. How amazing then, how affecting to a con|&s;iderate Mind mu&s;t be the Ob&s;ervation of the little Devotion which is paid, by the Generality of Men, to this worthie&s;t and mo&s;t rational Object of their Reverence, Love and Gratitude! If therefore Edu|cation is not pointed again&s;t, and does not actually remedy this Evil, whatever el&s;e it does is of little or no Con&s;equence to the Soul, either in this World, or in that which is to come.</P>
<P>THE other Thing that occurs to me, relates to the holy Scriptures. Tho' they cannot be in too common U&s;e, and the &s;ooner and the oftner they are read the better, yet as by the Introduction of them into the School Exerci&s;es, and for the learn|ing of Languages, or Words, or Letters, there a|ri&s;es a Di&s;gu&s;t to them, or at be&s;t an in&s;ipid and carele&s;s U&s;e of them; to prevent this, my Notion is, and I offer it with the utmo&s;t Caution, that the&s;e Books be taught in &s;eparate and di&s;tinct Lec|tures, and treated as containing a Me&s;&s;age from the mo&s;t high JEHOVAH to Mankind, committed to his
<PB N="32" REF="006754_0038_10298D45DD843E70">mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Son, &s;ent expre&s;ly from Heaven to deliver it; and further, that there are in them Mat|ters of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to our everla&s;ting Salvation. After this is well under&s;tood, the ea&s;y Parts &s;hould be read fir&s;t, and explained to them in their native Tongue, or in <HI>Latin,</HI> or <HI>Greek,</HI> when the&s;e Languages are become familiar, then the more difficult Pa&s;&s;ages &s;hould be treated of; and herein a ju&s;t and proper Order &s;hould be ob&s;erved as the Under&s;tanding opens, and can bear them; al|ways remembering, that the Scripture every where takes for granted, that Men are con&s;cious there is in them a Power of Rea&s;oning, moral Sen&s;e, &s;ocial Affection, Love of Truth, Approbation of good Actions and Characters, and Love of E&s;teem; to|gether with the Pains of Remor&s;e, Shame and Sympathy. It is on the real Exi&s;tence of the&s;e Qualities and Affections in the human Soul, that the Prophets in &s;uch pathetick Strains call upon Men to make the Almighty the Object of their Love and Adoration, and to exerci&s;e towards his divine Maje&s;ty in the highe&s;t Degree the &s;ame Gratitude, Awe and Reverence, which they &s;ee good and grateful Men exerci&s;e towards their Benefactors here, and for which they are univer|&s;ally admired and beloved. The&s;e Qualities are con-natural to the Soul; and tho' weakened and impair'd, yet not totally extingui&s;hed by the Fall. They make up in &s;hort the Re&s;emblance which forms <HI>the Likene&s;s and Image of God,</HI> after which holy Writ &s;ays we were at fir&s;t made. To the&s;e the Scripture con&s;tantly addre&s;&s;es it&s;elf; the&s;e are put into Motion by <HI>Grace;</HI> to the&s;e are applied, as Seed to well prepared Ground, all tho&s;e gracious Di&s;cour&s;es of our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles; on the&s;e the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> exerts his efficacious Influen|ces; from the&s;e the <HI>Saint</HI> is produced <HI>elect, preci|ous;</HI> the&s;e are &s;ome of the Materials out of which
<PB N="33" REF="006754_0039_10298D4763AFAE60">we are built up <HI>a &s;piritual Hou&s;e, a royal Prie&s;thood, a cho&s;en Generation, an holy Nation, a peculiar People.</HI> From the&s;e <HI>the perfect Man</HI> is formed, and by them we attain <HI>to the Mea&s;ure of the Stature of the Fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things duly pre&s;&s;ed, together with the Childrens con&s;tant Attendance at their re&s;pective Places of Wor&s;hip (a Point likewi&s;e to be &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on) will be the likelie&s;t Means to &s;ecure a ju&s;t Re|verence to the King of Kings, and to the in&s;pired Writings of the Old and New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>I now proceed to my la&s;t general Head; <HI>To ex|hort all pre&s;ent to give their utmo&s;t Encouragement to this pious In&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>To relieve another under pre&s;&s;ing Afflictions, is a very laudable Act.&mdash;To be a&s;&s;iduous to find out the Unfortunate and Mi&s;erable, and to admini&s;ter &s;uita|ble and quick Relief, con&s;titutes the Character of a good Man.&mdash;Were many &s;uch good Per&s;ons in any one Place, the Evils of Life would there be con|&s;iderably decrea&s;ed.&mdash;By well concerted Schemes to introduce into a Country a Number of &s;en&s;ible and virtuous Men, or to make them &s;o who live already in it, and to make a Provi&s;ion for a Supply of &s;uch good Men in future Times, is the noble&s;t Effort of the human Under&s;tanding. This la&s;t, the highe&s;t Step in this enumerated Gradation of Good, is the Object of the Intention of tho&s;e who plann'd the In&s;titution now to be recommended to you: It has therefore the ju&s;te&s;t Claims to your Attention and A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Good which under the divine Ble&s;|&s;ing it will immediately produce, is very con&s;idera|ble; but in no wi&s;e to be put into Competition with its falutary Effects on the ri&s;ing Generation. More Evils may be prevented by it, than (were they for want of it &s;uffered to exi&s;t) cou'd be remedied by all the virtuous Men of the Place put together, aided with all the Power and Wealth of the Community.

Cheri&s;h, my dear Brethren, this Di&s;po&s;ition in your&s;elves and your Fellow Citi|zens; you don't know to what Length it may go; if, as &s;ome project, others are &s;till as ready to exe|cute, undervaluing per&s;onal Trouble and Expence; I can, without the Impeachment of an over-fond Love of Country, pronounce this will become a mo&s;t admired and happy Province.</P>

<P>And, fir&s;t, the Principles of Duty engage me to addre&s;s my&s;elf to You, Sir, to whom the Care of this Government is committed, in Favour of this Academical Collection of Schools. 'Tis what you have long rather wi&s;hed for, and lamented the Lo&s;s of, than ever expected. This you did when in a private Station; what may not then be expected now the Event is come to pa&s;s, not only in your own Time, but in your own Admini&s;tration? Ju|&s;tice calls on the Tru&s;tees to expre&s;s their grateful Sen&s;e of what you have already done. Their Know|ledge of the warm Place it has in your Brea&s;t, makes them with the &s;incere&s;t Confidence ready to con&s;ult and advi&s;e with you, and to indulge large Hopes of the Continuance of your Protection and Liberality. The Sen&s;e and Morals of the Peo|ple are as much the Object of the Care of a good Governor, as their Lives and Properties; a Con&s;i|deration which will undoubtedly lead you, con&s;cien|tious in the Di&s;charge of your high Tru&s;t, to pro|mote its Succe&s;s with a peculiar Zeal.

<P>I now beg Leave to addre&s;s you, Gentlemen, who have taken upon you the great Tru&s;t of carrying into Execution the Plan of Education propo&s;ed to be ob&s;erved in this Academy. And I would do it in the mo&s;t affectionate Manner, having the Honour to be not only of your Acquaintance, but in your Friend&s;hip. What I &s;ay will be only de|claratory of the firm Purpo&s;es of your own Hearts, and of the Expectations of the Publick. The Eyes of all are upon you, and as an ab&s;olute Confidence is placed in your per&s;onal Probity, Diligence and Abilities, it is expected that you will be mighty careful in your Examination of the Talents and Mo|rals of all who offer for In&s;tructors in the &s;everal Schools. That you admit none from a partial Fa|vour or Affection, or from an ill-judged Compa&s;|&s;ion to the Lowne&s;s of their Circum&s;tances, or any other Con&s;ideration than Merit previou&s;ly exami|ned, and after mature Con&s;ideration approved. That you &s;ee every Thing with your own Eyes, and for that Purpo&s;e that you be frequent in your Vi&s;its to the Schools, and be careful to make the Rector report at proper Periods of Time the State of each School, and the Improvement of the Scholars, that it may be timely &s;een if any u&s;eful Additions or Alterations ought to be made to the Plan. That &s;ince you &s;tand engaged to give all becoming En|couragements
<PB N="36" REF="006754_0042_10298D5370AC4808">to the Scholars, you will not fail to give di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks of your Favour to &s;uch as de&s;erve well of you by their Advancement in Lite|rature; and if any &s;hall di&s;cover more than ordina|ry Talents, which will want your A&s;&s;i&s;tance to be improved to their utmo&s;t Extent, that you be not backward in giving it. And in particular, that you do not &s;uffer any Regard to Party, Kindred, or Friend&s;hip, to bya&s;s you in your Judgments, but that every Thing be done with Candour, Affection, and a di&s;intere&s;ted Attachment to per&s;onal De&s;ert, and the Reputation of the Academy.

<P>ORDER now calls upon me to addre&s;s you, who pre&s;ide in the Schools. The generous Love of Learning, of which you have given &s;o ample a Te&s;timony, by the ready Tender of your Services, gives Room to expect all that Abilities, Integrity and Care can do for the Youth committed to your Tuition. The Rector has a Precedency given him, from which both he and you may draw many Ad|vantages; you will never want one to con&s;ult with who, on all Occa&s;ions, will be &s;ure to give you af|fectionate Advice, and repre&s;ent to the Tru&s;tees any Difficulties or Inconveniencies which may occur in Tru&s;ts of &s;o complex a Nature: You may &s;peak with perfect Freedom to him, tho' I am per&s;uaded it will not be without a ju&s;t Regard to his Superiori|ty: And he will make no other U&s;e of the Pre&s;i|dent&s;hip, than to render your re&s;pective Duties ea&s;y and delightful to you; he will be a ready Fellow-Labourer with you; his Good-nature, Prudence and Moderation, will make him think that he has no Authority placed in him but for the Good, and from a Regard to the Order and Subordination nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in &s;uch a Collection of Schools; nor will you &s;uffer &s;o unbecoming a Thought to enter into your Minds, as that your

You will take all Op|portunities to repre&s;ent the Chri&s;tian Religion in its na|tive and genuine Excellency and Perfection: As the kinde&s;t and fulle&s;t In&s;truction of the wi&s;e&s;t of Be|ings, and the mo&s;t affectionate of Parents: As a Sy&s;tem of Laws authoritatively publi&s;hed for the &s;ole Rule of Faith and Manners, and compleatly calculated to promote every Intere&s;t Men can have either as di&s;cretionary Tenants in this World, or as Inheritors, by divine Favour, of the Kingdom of Heaven; and may the Lord impart unto you the Truth, and with it perfect Freedom, and a Di&s;po|&s;ition to do all to his Glory, and the Good of the Souls committed to your Care.</P>
<P>I AM under very &s;trong Ties of Affection towards you my Fellow Citizens, who compo&s;e the remain|ing Part of this Audience, and &s;hall endeavour to Form my particular Addre&s;s to you in Terms an|&s;werable to my E&s;teem of you. As an In&s;tance of

I am not concern'd to rai&s;e a momentary Warmth in your Brea&s;ts, but to engage your Judgments, and in Con&s;equence thereof, your Affections, in Behalf of the Academy. I hope to hear you enquire frequent|ly and importunately, of the Succe&s;s of the&s;e Schools, as if you thought your&s;elves more than ordinarily intere&s;ted therein: I have often been a delighted Witne&s;s of the va&s;t Plea&s;ure you receive, when Strangers expre&s;s favourable Sentiments of the ad|vanced State of this Colony; this is a good Omen in their Favour. I would not damp this ju&s;t and becoming Spirit; may your Children inherit it, and be enabled to perpetuate the Advantages you enjoy. One may venture to pronounce, that, imbued with good Principles, intimately acquainted with the ancient and modern Con&s;titutions of Kingdoms; their Souls fired with the Examples of the worthy Characters, with the noble Sentiments, and perfect Models of Antiquity; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a well-grounded and complete Knowledge in Arts and Sciences; they will pre&s;erve the &s;acred Depo&s;ite of all your ju&s;tly e&s;teemed Privileges, and deliver them down, with &s;till greater Improvement, to the late&s;t Po|&s;terity.</P>
<P>AND now to bring this Di&s;cour&s;e towards a Con|clu&s;ion: There is one Science worth all the re&s;t, and to which all of us may attain; and, Oh! that I could find Language powerful enough to give it its ju&s;t Recommendation; I mean, the Science of Liv|ing well; in this all are concerned, but principally tho&s;e who are advanced in Years, for on the&s;e the Eyes of the Young are naturally fixed, and from them they take their Mea&s;ures. Alas, could it be
<PB N="39" REF="006754_0045_10298D580AC10570">&s;een what a mighty Train of Evils does frequently follow one bad Example, it would amaze the be&s;t informed Man among&s;t us! Tho' the Evils which we &s;ee every Day occa&s;ioned by bad Lives, are ve|ry numerous, and of the wor&s;t Sort, yet they are not to be put in Compari&s;on with the &s;ecret and unperceiv'd Mi&s;chiefs produced by their Influence on the pre&s;ent and &s;ucceeding Generations? Suffer me, to pre&s;ent this &s;ad View of Things, with all be|coming Earne&s;tne&s;s, to &s;uch as have the Direction and Care of Families.</P>
<P>YOUR Children knowing that you have gone thro' Life before them, and thinking that you are perfectly well acquainted with what relates to it, place an ab&s;olute Confidence in what you &s;ay and do, and have an entire Dependance on your Judg|ments and Practices. Believe me, your Children are nice Ob&s;ervers of your Behaviour, not only in Matters wherein they them&s;elves are immediately concerned, but in &s;uch as relate to others; and per|haps in the&s;e latter, a great deal more than you think of; it is no Secret to them that in the&s;e you act without Re&s;erve, and on full and free Choice; and therefore from the&s;e more than from your immediate Conduct towards them, they form their Notions of the Value and Goodne&s;s of Actions and Characters. Now let me a&s;k you &s;eriou&s;ly, Are you not extremely unju&s;t to the&s;e little Ones, your own Fle&s;h and Blood, and for whom you feel and expre&s;s &s;o much Tenderne&s;s, if as they grow up, you do not form your own Examples on the Models of Piety and Goodne&s;s, for their ea&s;y Ob&s;ervance and Imitation? Are you not aware, that without this, neither your own, nor their Ma&s;ters Le&s;&s;ons or Corrections can avail. Let therefore the Principles of Ju&s;tice and natural Affection to your Children, engage you to lead holy and good Lives.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="006754_0046_10298D6186B92160">
IF you have the Misfortune to live by wicked and bad Neighbours, as &s;uch Per&s;ons nece&s;&s;arily &s;ooner or later fall into Di&s;a&s;ters and afflictive Circum&s;tances, the&s;e too will furni&s;h good Lectures to your Children and Dependants; Oh, what a mighty Advantage would it be to them, if every now and then you took Occa&s;ion, from &s;ome emi|nent Calamity befalling any one who lived in the notorious Neglect of Goodne&s;s and Virtue, or in the open Practice of Vice, to &s;et forth to your Families in a plain and affecting Manner, the certain Connexi|on between the &s;ad Event and the wicked Man's Way of Living, and this not with too much Strictne&s;s and Formality, but in the Way of Conver&s;ation and Fami|ly Di&s;cour&s;e, and at a Time when you find your Children and Servants in a fit and attentive Di&s;po|&s;ition. It can &s;carce be believed what an Effect tho&s;e little occa&s;ional Hi&s;tories would have on the Minds of the Young. The Calamity being before their Eyes, and its Cau&s;es made evident, their Pa&s;&s;ions would be all in Motion, and their Memories va&s;tly retentive: On their fir&s;t being tempted to do an ill Thing, the&s;e &s;ad Con&s;equences would recur to them, and with their Shame and Mode&s;ty, the natural Barrier of Youth, pre&s;erve them from bad Cour&s;es, till their own Judgment &s;hould attain its Ripene&s;s, and come with a pure and uncorrupted Force to their Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>BUT exclu&s;ive of the&s;e Con&s;iderations re&s;pecting others, let us learn this Science of Living well from Motives re&s;pecting our own Happine&s;s. By being good in our&s;elves, and u&s;eful to the World, we are in the proper Exerci&s;es of our rational Nature, our Affections then fa&s;ten on their proper Objects, and we gradually recover the Purity, and Dignity, and Excellency of our primitive Nature, made for the Practice of Benevolence and &s;ocial Virtue: We evidence the divine Original of our Souls, and even

O ble&s;&s;ed Science, which thus prepares and exalts us thro' divine Grace unto a State of Glory. To conclude:</P>
<P>WHETHER there be Tongues, they &s;hall cea&s;e; whether there be Knowledge, it &s;hall vani&s;h away, but this Science of Living well, &s;hall remain. Death indeed removes us from all further U&s;e of human Knowledge, and the Exerci&s;e of human Improve|ments, but it does not remove us from the Prac|tice of Goodne&s;s, it does not take away the Joys re&s;ulting from the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Piety, Beneficence and Charity: So far from this, Death will mightily enlarge their Sphere of Action, pre&s;ent a much nobler World, where the Adepts in this Science in|&s;tead of bringing forth the tender Buds and Blo&s;|&s;omings of growing Virtue, will be enabled to bring forth the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s, in their ju&s;t Perfection, even in angelick Maturity. In &s;hort, a good Man embraces Death as opening to him the happy Place where the Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect are reaping the Rewards of their Vir|tue, even &s;upreme and inconceivable Happine&s;s, <HI>&s;uch as Eye bath not &s;een, nor Ear heard, nor bath it entered into the Heart of Man to conceive;</HI> which that we may all receive, may GOD of his infinite Mer|cy grant, thro' the Merits of our Lord JESUS CHRIST: To whom, with the Holy Gho&s;t, be the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, now and for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>IDEA <HI>of the</HI> ENGLISH SCHOOL, <HI>Sketch'd out for the Con&s;ideration of the</HI> TRU|STEES <HI>of the</HI> PHILADELPHIA ACADEMY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is expected that every Scholar to be admitted into this School, be at lea&s;t able to pronounce and divide the Syllables in Reading, and to write a legible Hand. None to be receiv'd that are under <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> Years of Age.</P>

<P>LET the fir&s;t Cla&s;s learn the <HI>Engli&s;h Grammar</HI> Rules, and at the &s;ame time let particular Care be taken to improve them in <HI>Orthography.</HI> Perhaps the latter is be&s;t done by <HI>Pairing</HI> the Scholars, two of tho&s;e neare&s;t equal in their Spelling to be put to|gether; let the&s;e &s;trive for Victory, each propound|ing Ten Words every Day to the other to be &s;pelt. He that &s;pells truly mo&s;t of the other's Words, is Victor for that Day; he that is Victor mo&s;t Days in a Month, to obtain a Prize, a pretty neat Book of &s;ome Kind u&s;eful in their future Studies. This Method fixes the Attention of Children extreamly to the Orthography of Words, and makes them good Spellers very early. 'Tis a Shame for a Man to be &s;o ignorant of this little Art, in his own Language, as to be perpetually confounding Words of like Sound and different Significations; the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of which Defect, makes &s;ome Men, otherwi&s;e of good Learning and Under&s;tanding, aver&s;e to Wri|ting even a common Letter.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="006754_0056_10298D84D52BE818">
LET the Pieces read by the Scholars in this Cla&s;s be &s;hort, &s;uch as <HI>Croxall</HI>'s Fables, and little Stories. In giving the Le&s;&s;on, let it be read to them; let the Meaning of the difficult Words in it be explain|ed to them, and let them con it over by them&s;elves before they are called to read to the Ma&s;ter, or U&s;her; who is to take particular Care that they do not read too fa&s;t, and that they duly ob&s;erve the Stops and Pau&s;es. A Vocabulary of the mo&s;t u&s;u|al difficult Words might be formed for their U&s;e, with Explanations; and they might daily get a few of tho&s;e Words and Explanations by Heart, which would a little exerci&s;e their Memories; or at lea&s;t they might write a Number of them in a &s;mall Book for the Purpo&s;e, which would help to fix the Mean|ing of tho&s;e Words in their Minds, and at the &s;ame Time furni&s;h every one with a little Dictionary for his future U&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="class">
<HEAD>The Second <HI>CLASS</HI> to be taught</HEAD>
<P>READING with Attention, and with proper Mo|dulations of the Voice according to the Sentiments and Subject.</P>
<P>SOME &s;hort Pieces, not exceeding the Length of a <HI>Spectator,</HI> to be given this Cla&s;s as Le&s;&s;ons (and &s;ome of the ea&s;ier <HI>Spectators</HI> would be very &s;uitable for the Purpo&s;e.) The&s;e Le&s;&s;ons might be given o|ver Night as Ta&s;ks, the Scholars to &s;tudy them a|gain&s;t the Morning. Let it then be required of them to give an Account, fir&s;t of the Parts of Speech, and Con&s;truction of one or two Sen|tences; this will oblige them to recur frequently to their Grammar, and fix its principal Rules in their Memory. Next of the <HI>Intention</HI> of the Writer, or the <HI>Scope</HI> of the Piece; the Meaning of each Sen|tence, and of every uncommon Word. This would early acquaint them with the Meaning and Force of
<PB N="3" REF="006754_0057_10298D86A22F6B48">Words, and give them that mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Habit, of Reading with Attention.</P>
<P>THE Ma&s;ter then to read the Piece with the pro|per Modulations of Voice, due Empha&s;is, and &s;uit|able Action, where Action is required; and put the Youth on imitating his Manner.</P>
<P>WHERE the Author has us'd an Expre&s;&s;ion not the be&s;t, let it be pointed out; and let his Beauties be particularly remarked to the Youth.</P>
<P>LET the Le&s;ions for Reading be varied, that the Youth may be made acquainted with good Stiles of all Kinds in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e, and the proper Manner of reading each Kind. Sometimes a well told Story, a Piece of a Sermon, a General's Speech to his Sol|diers, a Speech in a Tragedy, &s;ome Part of a Co|medy, an Ode, a Satyr, a Letter, Blank Ver&s;e, Hudibra&s;tick, Heroic, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But let &s;uch Le&s;&s;ons for Reading be cho&s;en, as contain &s;ome u&s;eful In&s;tructi|on, whereby the Under&s;tandings or Morals of the Youth, may at the &s;ame Time be improv'd.</P>
<P>IT is requir'd that they &s;hould fir&s;t &s;tudy and un|der&s;tand the Le&s;&s;ons, before they are put upon read|ing them properly, to which End each Boy &s;hould have an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dictionary to help him over Diffi|culties. When our Boys read <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to us, we are apt to imagine <HI>they</HI> under&s;tand what <HI>they</HI> read be|cau&s;e <HI>we</HI> do, and becau&s;e 'tis their Mother Tongue. But they often read as Parrots &s;peak, knowing lit|tle or nothing of the Meaning. And it is impo&s;&s;ible a Reader &s;hould give the due Modulation to his Voice, and pronounce properly, unle&s;s his Under&s;tanding goes before his Tongue, and makes him Ma&s;ter of the Sentiment. Accu&s;toming Boys to read aloud what they do not fir&s;t under&s;tand, is the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e even &s;et Tones &s;o common among Readers, which when they have once got a Habit of u&s;ing, they find &s;o difficult to correct: By which Means, among Fifty Readers we &s;carcely find a good One.
<PB N="4" REF="006754_0058_10298D8C4AA44228">For want of good Reading, Pieces publi&s;h'd with a View to influence the Minds of Men for their own or the publick Benefit, lo&s;e Half their Force.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="class">
<HEAD>The Third <HI>CLASS</HI> to be taught</HEAD>
<P>SPEAKING properly and gracefully, which is near of Kin to good Reading, and naturally follows it in the Studies of Youth. Let the Scholars of this Cla&s;s begin with learning the Elements of Rheto|ric from &s;ome &s;hort Sy&s;tem, &s;o as to be able to give an Account of the mo&s;t u&s;ual Tropes and Figures. Let all their bad Habits of Speaking, all Offences again&s;t good Grammar, all corrupt or foreign Ac|cents, and all improper Phra&s;es, be pointed out to them. Short Speeches from the <HI>Roman</HI> or other Hi&s;tory, or from our <HI>Parliamentary Debates,</HI> might be got by heart, and deliver'd with the proper Action, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Speeches and Scenes in our be&s;t Tragedies and Comedies (avoiding every Thing that could injure the Morals of Youth) might likewi&s;e be got by Rote, and the Boys exercis'd in delivering or acting them; great Care being taken to form their Manner after the true&s;t Models.</P>
<P>FOR their farther Improvement, and a little to vary their Studies, let them now begin to read <HI>Hi|&s;tory,</HI> after having got by Heart a &s;hort Table of the principal Epochas in Chronology. They may begin with <HI>Rollin</HI>'s <HI>Antient and Roman Hi&s;tories,</HI> and pro|ceed at proper Hours as they go thro' the &s;ub&s;e|quent Cla&s;&s;es, with the be&s;t Hi&s;tories of our own Nation and Colonies. Let Emulation be excited a|mong the Boys by giving, Weekly, little Prizes, or other &s;mall Encouragements to tho&s;e who are able
<PB N="5" REF="006754_0059_10298246E4124C78">to give the be&s;t Account of what they have read, as to Times, Places, Names of Per&s;ons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This will make them read with Attention, and imprint the Hi&s;tory well in their Memories. In remarking on the Hi&s;tory, the Ma&s;ter will have fine Op|portunities of in&s;tilling In&s;truction of various Kinds, and improving the Morals as well as the Under&s;tand|ings of Youth.</P>
<P>THE Natural and Mechanic Hi&s;tory contain'd in <HI>Spectacle de la Nature,</HI> might al&s;o be begun in this Cla&s;s, and continued thro' the &s;ub&s;equent Cla&s;&s;es by other Books of the &s;ame Kind: For next to the Knowledge of <HI>Duty,</HI> this Kind of Knowledge is cer|tainly the mo&s;t u&s;eful, as well as the mo&s;t entertain|ing. The Merchant may thereby be enabled better to under&s;tand many Commodities in Trade; the Handicraft&s;man to improve his Bu&s;ine&s;s by new In|&s;truments, Mixtures and Materials; and frequently Hints are given of new Manufactures, or new Me|thods of improving Land, that may be &s;et on foot greatly to the Advantage of a Country.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="class">
<HEAD>The Fourth <HI>CLASS</HI> to be taught</HEAD>
<P>COMPOSITION. Writing one's own Language well, is the next nece&s;&s;ary Accompli&s;hment after good Speaking. 'Tis the Writing-Ma&s;ter's Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to take Care that the Boys make fair Cha|racters, and place them &s;traight and even in the Lines: But to <HI>form their Stile,</HI> and even to take Care that the Stops and Capitals are properly di&s;|po&s;ed, is the Part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ma&s;ter. The Boys &s;hould be put on Writing Letters to each other on any common Occurrences, and on various Subjects, imaginary Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> containing little Stories, Accounts of their late Reading, what Parts of Au|thors plea&s;e them, and why. Letters of Congratu|lation, of Compliment, of Reque&s;t, of Thanks, of
<PB N="6" REF="006754_0060_10298D96170AD1A8">Recommendation, of Admonition, of Con&s;olation, of Expo&s;tulation, Excu&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the&s;e they &s;hould be taught to expre&s;s them&s;elves clearly, conci&s;ely, and naturally, without affected Words, or high-flown Phra&s;es. All their Letters to pa&s;s through the Ma&s;ter's Hand, who is to point out the Faults, ad|vi&s;e the Corrections, and commend what he finds right. Some of the be&s;t Letters publi&s;hed in our own Language, as Sir <HI>William Temple</HI>'s, tho&s;e of <HI>Pope,</HI> and his Friends, and &s;ome others, might be &s;et before the Youth as Models, their Beauties point|ed out and explained by the Ma&s;ter, the Letters them&s;elves tran&s;crib'd by the Scholar.</P>
<P>DR. JOHNSON's <HI>Ethices Elementa,</HI> or fir&s;t Princi|ples of Morality, may now be read by the Scholars, and explain'd by the Ma&s;ter, to lay a &s;olid Founda|tion of Virtue and Piety in their Minds. And as this Cla&s;s continues the Reading of Hi&s;tory, let them now at proper Hours receive &s;ome farther In&s;tructi|ons in Chronology, and in that Part of Geography (from the Mathematical Ma&s;ter) which is nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand the Maps and Globes. They &s;hould al&s;o be acquainted with the modern Names of the Places they find mention'd in antient Writers.
