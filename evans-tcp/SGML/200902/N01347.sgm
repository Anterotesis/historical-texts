<HEAD>By the Reverend, Old Mr. <HI>JOHN COTTON,</HI> At <HI>Salem, June,</HI> 1636.</HEAD>
<P>HAving been moved by your Reve|rend Elders, and &s;ome Others, to Speak a Word of <HI>In&s;truction</HI> and <HI>Exhortation;</HI> I thought it meet to begin with &s;ome word of <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>At the fir&s;t coming over of &s;ome of our Honoured Magi&s;trates, it &s;o fell out, That they did Arrive at this Congregation, the Sa|crament being near to be Admini&s;tred, and a Child being Born to one of them; they them&s;elves could neither be admitted to the Lord's Table, nor their Child to Bapti&s;m: When I my &s;elf heard of this, I Wrote unto the Pa&s;tor of this Congregation (now De|cea&s;ed) doubting of the Lawfulne&s;s of that practi&s;e; Thinking then, That the Faithful and Godly Men coming where the Seals
<PB N="2" REF="001603_0003_0FB3E6A0DDA8D1B8">
were to be di&s;pen&s;ed, and having right unto the Covenant, had right al&s;o unto the Seals thereof, and &s;o that their Children had right unto the former Seal of Bapti&s;m Some|thing I wrote to that purpo&s;e, as I conceived, then requi&s;ite. It plea&s;ed God that he &s;ent me a large and loving An&s;wer; but through the extremity of Sickne&s;s then upon me, I could not Read it; and after-wards being &s;huffled among other Papers, I could never find it to this very day: But what might have been for In&s;truction to me from his Letters, the Lord hath &s;ince &s;hewed unto me by diligent &s;earch of the Scriptures.</P>
<P>So that however I apprehended the Matter at that time, there was ju&s;t Rea&s;on for what was done: And now le&s;t I &s;hould &s;eem to alter my judgment herein without &s;ome weighty Cau&s;e, Let me tell you what pre|vailed with me, to cau&s;e me to A&s;&s;ent to the judgment and practi&s;e of the Churches here.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="reasons">
<HEAD>The Rea&s;ons are Two.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 1. The fir&s;t is taken from the Cove|nant unto whom it doth belong. I formerly conceived, That unto all the Faithful the Co|venant
<PB N="3" REF="001603_0004_0FB3E6A247BAF548">
did belong, and unto their Seed al&s;o, not con&s;idering, that which &s;ince I have learned &amp; found, That the Covenant which is made to Me, and to my Seed, <HI>Is not made to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith at large, But to them that are Righteous by the Faith of the Seed of Abraham; that is, to &s;uch Believers as are Confederate with Abraham.</HI> And there|fore it was, That though Circumci&s;ion the old Seal of the Covenant (an&s;werable to our Bapti&s;m) was Admini&s;tred to all the Seed of Abraham, <HI>Yet not unto tho&s;e godly Men that Believed in his Age:</HI> For Abraham and his Family were then the only vi&s;ible Church of God upon the Face of the Earth. And though Melchizedeck lived at that time, who was an heir of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith, yet not of the Covenant of Abra|ham, unle&s;s he will joyn him&s;elf to the Fa|mily of <HI>Abraham.</HI> Nor <HI>Job</HI> him&s;elf, though he was a Man none like him upon the Face of the Earth; nor his Friends; <HI>Men fearing God,</HI> in their Generation, were yet uncapa|ble of Circumci&s;ion, unle&s;s they had joyned them&s;elves to the Family of <HI>Abraham.</HI> And therefore you &s;hall never read that the Co|venant belongeth to Me, and to my Seed,
<PB N="4" REF="001603_0005_0FB3E6A3C1DA4DE0">
unle&s;s I be of the Seed of Abraham, or joyned to the Family of Abraham. So we &s;hall find it in the Sanction of the Second Commandment, <HI>That the Lord &s;heweth Mer|cy to thou&s;ands of the Generations of &s;uch as Love and Fear Him:</HI> That Commandment hath re&s;pect to God's In&s;tituted Ordinances. Let <HI>Jonah</HI> go to <HI>Niniveh,</HI> and by the ble&s;&s;ing of God prevail with Thou&s;ands, then the Covenant of Grace belongs to them; but What? to their Seed al&s;o? No, verily not, unle&s;s their Parents were Confederate to the Seed of Abraham. So that if you de&s;ire Mercy to you, and to your Seed, <HI>Keep then to the Ordinances, and to the God of the Or|dinances, and &s;o you &s;hall keep a con&s;tant in|tail of the Covenant to you, and to your Seed; for unle&s;s Men injoy the Covenant this way, it aoth not belong unto their Seed.</HI> This be|ing not con&s;idered, I fear, hath brought great Mi&s;chief to all the Churches that have not attended unto this Principle, and hath been an occa&s;ion of much Mi&s;take to many godly Parents, who plead their Co|venant for their Seed, and many times &s;o find little ble&s;&s;ing; for though God hath made a Covenant with them, yet it is but
<PB N="5" REF="001603_0006_0FB3E6A53A2ABB58">
as a Scattered Stone, not laid orderly in any building; &s;o that truly they may plead; but when God cometh to An&s;wer, He will make it appear, That He did never open His Mouth for a Covenant with their Seed until they be Confederate with Abraham.</P>
<P>And therefore &s;eeing my Letter, as I under&s;tand, is in many of your hands, I had rather make a Plai&s;ter bigger than the Sore, than that it &s;hould be pleaded again&s;t my practi&s;e after my Departure.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 2. The Second Rea&s;on is this, Unto them that are not in Covenant, a Mi|ni&s;ter may not di&s;pence an act of Power and intrude him&s;elf, neither hath he any Power until he be Called; and then only over &s;uch as Call him: And therefore if you &s;hould come to crave Bapti&s;m for your Children, or the Lord's Supper for your &s;elves, of a Mini&s;ter whom you have not Called over you, he hath no Power, and therefore unto you he cannot di&s;pence an act of Power: So that although the hearts of God's People might be inlarged many times, to do &s;uch things, <HI>Yet the Law of the Lords Go&s;pel
<PB N="6" REF="001603_0007_0FB3E6A6BB7DC838">
doth Re&s;train them, until Men have entred into Covenant, and not their own &s;trait laced|ne&s;s that keeps them back from di&s;pencing &s;uch things.</HI></P>
<P>A Third <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> which is Coincident with the Second, and &s;erveth to amplify the Point, That they have no Power over you, it will plainly appear from this ground; They that have no Power to Excommuni|cate you, they have no Power to Admit you to Communion with them; But till you joyn your &s;elves in Covenant with the Church, they have no Power of Excommu|nication; Therefore till then, they have no Power to Admit you to Communion with them, for there is the like rea&s;on of both.</P>
<P>Now having expre&s;&s;ed this Word of <HI>Con|fe&s;&s;ion,</HI> together with my acknowledgment of my dependance upon the Lord for grief and &s;orrow; I this de&s;ire, That if my Let|ter Remain Written in any of your hands, you would not now look at it as my judg|ment; though &s;ometime it was, yet now you have heard it retracted again by me, Profe&s;&s;ing al&s;o, that if any thing which I
<PB N="7" REF="001603_0008_0FB3E6A841EC7A38">
have &s;ince Written or Spoken, God give me to &s;ee it, appear different from the Truth, I will retract it al&s;o; in the mean time blame me not, if I do not retract it.</P>

<P>&mdash;Come, and let us cleave unto the Lord in a Perpe|tual and Everla&s;ting Covenant which &s;hall never be forgotten.</P>

<P>THe&s;e be the words which were foretold by Jeremiah, which the People of God Returning out of Captivity of Babel &s;hould u&s;e for the incourage|ment of one another to return to Sion, and there to bind them&s;elves in Church Covenant with the Lord; for &s;o you read it in the ver&s;e foregoing: <HI>In tho&s;e dayes (when the Lord &s;hall de|&s;troy Babel) the Children of I&s;rael &s;hall come, and the Children of Judah together, going, and weeping as they go: and &s;eek the Lord their God.

<P N="2">2. This joyning is &s;et forth.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) By the means of it: by a Covenant.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) That Covenant is here amplifyed by a double adjunct of a double Eternity.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here is the Covenant it &s;elf, that is Per|petual.</P>

<P>To &s;peak to joyning to the Lord at large, is neither the Principal intendment of my Text, nor may it be &s;o convenient to &s;peak only to it. I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to open it in &s;hewing the way in which they do joyn to the Lord.</P>
<P>The Doctrine which I would Commend to your Chri&s;tian con&s;ideration, is this;</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE</HEAD>
<Q>That the Church-Covenant, where-with the People of I&s;rael &amp; Judah did joyn them&s;elves to the Lord, e&s;pecially after their return from Babel; and yet more e&s;pecially under the days of the New Te&s;ta|ment, was a Perpetual Covenant.</Q>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001603_0010_0FB3E6AB9A538468"><HI>Come, let us joyn our &s;elves to the Lord.</HI> I&s;rael and Judah &s;pake this as they were a Church, and as they were about to renew Church Fel|low&s;hip; <HI>let us joyn our &s;elves to the Lord in a Per|petual Covenant that &s;hall never be forgotten.</HI> You read the like Expre&s;&s;ion, Jer. 31, 31, 32, 33, 34. <HI>This &s;hall be my Covenant with the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, &s;aith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they &s;hall be my People.</HI> And ver&s;e 34. <HI>I will for|give their Iniquities, and remember their Sins no more.</HI> It is therefore an Everla&s;ting Covenant; and He doth make the main difference between this and the former Covenant to lie in this; where|as they break that Covenant, v. 32. <HI>This Covenant &s;hall not be broken.</HI> The Lord made a Covenant with them before, but that Covenant they brake; <HI>and I regarded them not, &s;aith the Lord:</HI> as it is re|peated, <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.8. <HI>to</HI> 13. But in this latter Cove|nant, He will remember their Sins no more, and therefore He doth &s;peak of the Old Te&s;tament, as of that which doth vani&s;h away, but for the New Te&s;tament, He will e&s;tabli&s;h that; accor|ding to what is written, Jer. 32.40. <HI>I will make an Everla&s;ting Covenant with them, to do them good; but I will put my fear into their hearts, that they &s;hall not depart from me.</HI> The like we al&s;o read, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16 60. <HI>Tho' they have de&s;pi&s;ed the Oath in breaking the Covenant; neverthele&s;s, I will remember my Co|venant with thee in the days of thy Youth, and I will e&s;tabli&s;h unto thee an everla&s;ting Covenant.</HI> And
<PB N="10" REF="001603_0011_0FB3E6AD8D916B50">
wherein doth it differ from the Old Covenant? I know not better how to explain it than by laying both of them together, both the Old Co|venant and this New Covenant, which he doth more renew in the dayes of the New Te&s;tament. In the Old Covenant you may ob&s;erve a four-fold act of God, and a double act of the People.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> The Lord doth prepare his People, and calleth them to Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> and there reveal|eth Him&s;elf in Thundrings and Lightnings, and flames of Fire, &s;o that the &s;toute&s;t Spirits among&s;t them quaked; and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> tho' a Man full of faith, yet he &s;aith of him&s;elf, <HI>I exceedingly tremble and fear;</HI> and &s;o did all the People; and when they heard the voice of the Thunders, and &s;aw the Lightnings: <HI>Exod</HI> 20.18. <HI>to</HI> 21. They &s;aid to <HI>Mo|&s;es, Speak thou with us, and we will hear, but let not God Speak with us le&s;t we die.</HI> Thus did the Lord prepare them by breaking, for if the Lord do intend &s;ome real and &s;erious work, He will then &s;hake the foundation of the &s;tubborne&s;s of their hearts, and bring them to &s;ee their own &s;tubborne&s;s and ba&s;ene&s;s, for el&s;e they would de&s;pi&s;e it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The Second act of God is a Com|mandment which He doth put forth, wherein He doth require an exact Obedience unto all the Commandments of the Law, and to his Statutes &amp; Judgments: Exod. 19.5. <HI>If you will obey my voice indeed, &s;aith the Lord, and keep my Covenant; then you &s;hall be my peculiar trea&s;ure above all People.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="001603_0012_0FB3E6AF1C65A358">
Now this Covenant of God con&s;i&s;teth of Moral Laws, and Statutes and Judgments, unto all which He doth require Obedience, even to all that is written in the Law, <HI>Deut.</HI> 27.27.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> The Lord doth profe&s;s unto them all that &s;hould keep Covenant, That they &s;hould Live by keeping Covenant. And this is the Grand and Principle Promi&s;e wraping up all o|ther, <HI>Lev.</HI> 18.5. And the Apo&s;tle doth Interpret the meaning of that Promi&s;e: Gal. 3.12. <HI>The Law is not of faith, but the man that doth the&s;e things &s;hall Live in them:</HI> and this is the Promi&s;e of Life which God giveth to tho&s;e that keep Covenant.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> The fourth act of God in making this Covenant is, a heavy threatning of a cur&s;e to any that &s;hall break the&s;e Commandments, <HI>Deut.</HI> 27.22. Gal. 3.10. <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the Law to do them.</HI></P>
<P>Now there are two acts of the People.</P>
<P N="1">1. They do profe&s;s univer&s;al Obedience un|to all the Commandments, <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.27. <HI>Exod.</HI> 19 8. Twice they repeat it, <HI>All that the Lord &s;hall &s;ay unto us, we will bear it, and do it.</HI> Only con&s;ider this, They Promi&s;e it in &s;ome kind of opinion of their own Strength, without any &s;en&s;e or feel|ing of their own In&s;ufficiency; like men under pangs of Con&s;cience, they do believe that they &s;hall be able to keep and do all that the Lord &s;hall &s;ay unto them. <HI>O that there were &s;uch an heart in them!</HI> &s;aith the Lord, <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.29. Or as
<PB N="12" REF="001603_0013_0FB3E6B08C65DFB8">
the word is in the Original; <HI>Who &s;hall give them &s;uch a heart?</HI> But this they Promi&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. They yield them&s;elves to be accur&s;ed of God, if they &s;hall not keep that Covenant; and therefore when it was pronounced, <HI>Cur&s;ed is e|very one that continueth not in all things that are writ|ten in the Law to do them, all the People did &s;ay, Amen;</HI> and &s;o their faith lay upon a cur&s;e: This is the Old Covenant that God made with his People, and is called a Covenant of Works; the Lord requireth Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Works, He Promi|&s;eth Life to their Works, and they &s;ay, <HI>Amen,</HI> to enter into a cur&s;e. Now this was a temporal Covenant; this my Covenant they brake, &s;aith the Lord; and they did quickly turn a&s;ide from the wayes of the Lord, and therefore <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> when he cometh and &s;eeth the Calf which they had made, he brake the Tables of the Covenant.</P>
<P>Now for the Covenant that is Everla&s;ting&punc; we may ob&s;erve therein al&s;o four acts of God towards his People.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> Look as He prepareth the other by a Spirit of Bondage, &s;o he doth prepare the&s;e for His Everla&s;ting Covenant, by a Spirit of Pover|ty; and they are Poor and Afflicted in Spirit, in &s;en&s;e of their own Unworthine&s;s &amp; In&s;ufficiency, that which the Lord doth wi&s;h to the other, <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.29. He worketh in the&s;e: Zeph. 3.12. <HI>There &s;hall be brought home to Zion a Poor and an Afflicted People:</HI> He meaneth not in re&s;pect of their civil E&s;tates, for there was not a feeble People among&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="001603_0014_0FB3E6B202086E78">
them; but as they &s;tood in their Spirits, they were empty, and as they thought de&s;titute of God, and therefore &s;hould &s;eek the Lord and his Face, and his Strength, like tho&s;e that had lo&s;t both Church and Covenant; unto tho&s;e the Lord will have an Eye, and He will dwell with men of a contrite Spirit, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 57.15, 16. And therefore with a ble&s;&s;ing unto the&s;e, the Lord Chri&s;t doth begin His Sermon in the Mount: Matt. 5.3. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the Poor in Spirit.</HI> He doth not only afflict them with a Spirit of Bondage; but when he cometh to make a Covenant of <HI>Grace,</HI> the People are in&s;ufficient to do all which the Lord requireth; and this is a Spirit of Po|verty.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> When the Lord hath brought His People to be Poor in Spirit, He doth then Pro|mi&s;e them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> He giveth Him for a Covenant: I&s;ai 42 6. <HI>I have called thee in Righteou&s;ne&s;s: I will give thee for a Covenant unto the Gentiles.</HI> When the Lord maketh a Covenant of Grace, this is the gift of God; this is the Principal ble&s;&s;ing of the Covenant, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 49 8. And the Lord will not give Life in them to keep, and by them to up|hold, but Je&s;us Chri&s;t for both.</P>
<P N="2">2. In Je&s;us Chri&s;t He doth give Everla&s;ting Communion with Him. Through Chri&s;t He will take away the Stony heart, and give a heart of fle&s;h; and He will bring with Him Everla&s;t|ing Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.24. That is to &s;ay,
<PB N="14" REF="001603_0015_0FB3E6B387192B50">
Such Pardon of Sin as He will never revoke more, that Ju&s;tification which He will work in Chri&s;t, He will never repent of; and therefore he &s;aith, Jer 31.34. <HI>He will remember their Sins no more:</HI> and for their Sanctification He Promi&s;eth, Jer. 32.40. <HI>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they &s;hall not depart from me.</HI> And &s;o in all the ble&s;&s;ings of the Covenant, the Lord will give an Everla&s;ting Union and Communion with Him, in the injoyment of them.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> The&s;e three things the Lord doth require.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Faith:</HI> That is to &s;ay a yielding of the Soul to the Lord, as unable for this work, and yet to wait upon Him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s: Ezek. 36.37. <HI>I will be enquired for this of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them.</HI> Not only to be &s;ought unto for the Mercy, but I will be &s;ought, that is, They &s;hall &s;eek me, they &s;hall &s;eek his face and his &s;trength to do it all for them.</P>
<P N="2">2. He doth require the <HI>Obedience</HI> of Faith: and this is expre&s;sly called for, <HI>Rom.</HI> 16.26. That is, for &s;uch Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as none can work by any Graces of their own; but which being wrought in them doth put life and &s;trength into all their duties.</P>
<P N="3">3. He doth require of his People that they &s;hould be of a Melting frame of Spirit, in regard of all their Whori&s;hne&s;s, whereby they have prophaned His Name; they &s;hall wail and be|mone this: and therefore it is &s;aid of them in
<PB N="15" REF="001603_0016_0FB3E6B4F0108120">
the ver&s;e before the Text, That Weeping they &s;hould go, for all the Evils that they have wrought in God's &s;ight: And this is that which we read: <HI>Ezek.</HI> 6.9. <HI>They that e&s;cape of you &s;hall re|member me among the Nations whither they &s;hall be carried Captives, becau&s;e I am broken with their who|ri&s;h heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes which go a whoring after their Idols: and they &s;hall loath them&s;elves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.</HI> This doth the Lord require of his People: but ob&s;erve this withal, that He doth not require it in a way of a Legal command, but with an al&s;ufficient Vertue, whereby He will work in them what He doth require; &s;o that doth He require, that they &s;hould walk holily before Him, He Him|&s;elf doth al&s;o work this, for in this Everla&s;ting Covenant, the Commandments of God are Promi&s;es; for this will I be inquired, even to do all that he doth require: Zeph. 3.12. <HI>They &s;hall tru&s;t in the Name of the Lord.</HI> And &s;o for the Obedience of Faith: Ezek. 36.27. <HI>I will cau&s;e you to walk in my Statutes, and you &s;hall keep my Judgments and do them.</HI> He will make us able to do it, and willing to do it, and <HI>&s;o</HI> to do it. And this is the true meaning of all that the Lord doth require in the Everla&s;ting Covenant; when He doth Command He doth Promi&s;e. Doth he re|quire &s;eeking of Him?

The Lord prepareth the heart: certain duties indeed he doth lay upon them; as to believe in his Name, to yield the obedience of Faith, and to mourn for him; and he doth convey an effectu|al Power to work them.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> The fourth act is an act of Cur&s;ing belonging to this Covenant.</P>
<P N="1">1. To them that do not receive it.</P>
<P N="2">2. To tho&s;e that do Apo&s;tate from it: To them that do not receive it: <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.2, 3. If the word &s;poken by Angels was &s;tedfa&s;t, and every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and di&s;obedience, received a ju&s;t recompence of reward, how &s;hall we e&s;cape if neglect &s;o great Salvation? The neglecting of it brings de&s;perate Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e that do Apo&s;tate from it: Heb. 10.29. <HI>Of how much &s;orer Puni&s;hment &s;hall they be thought worthy of who have trodden under foot the Son of God, and have counted the blood of the Covenant, where|with they were &s;anctified, an unholy thing, &amp; have done de&s;pite unto the Spirit of Grace.</HI> This Covenant is that which is &s;poken of, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.1. be&s;ide the Covenant made in Mount <HI>Horeb:</HI> and to this Covenant belongeth a heavy cur&s;e: Deut. 30.17, 18. <HI>If thy heart turn away that thou wilt not bear, but &s;halt be drawn away, and wor&s;hip other gods, and &s;erve them, I denounce unto you this day, that ye &s;hall &s;urely peri&s;h, and that ye &s;hall not prolong your dayes upon the

Land whither thou pa&s;&s;e&s;t over Jordan to po&s;&s;e&s;s it.</HI> And that it is the Covenant of Grace, we may perceive by comparing, <HI>Deut.</HI> 30. <HI>v.</HI> 11. to the 14. with, <HI>Rom.</HI> 16.6. So that we may &s;ee the Lord doth threaten a heavy cur&s;e to fall upon them that tran&s;gre&s;s this Covenant.</P>
<P>Now for the Peoples part: Their acts are two.</P>
<P N="1">1. They fall down before the Lord confe&s;|&s;ing their Unworthine&s;s of any Mercy.</P>
<P N="2">2. Confe&s;&s;ing their own Inability and want of Strength; and this is that which Jo&s;hua la|boureth to po&s;&s;e&s;s the People with, <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 24.19. There he telleth them, <HI>Ye cannot &s;erve the Lord your God;</HI> that they might not tru&s;t in their own Strength: and therefore when the Lord doth make this Covenat with <HI>Abraham,</HI> he fell on his face, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.3. in &s;en&s;e of his own Unwor|thine&s;s.</P>
<P>Why this Covenant is &s;uch an Everla&s;ting Covenant?</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 1. Is from the Root &amp; Fountain of it: Jer. 31.3. <HI>I have loved thee with an Everla&s;ting love, therefore with Mercy have I drawn thee.</HI> What moveth the Lord to be thus earne&s;t and zealous in drawing men to Chri&s;t? <HI>No man can come to me,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>except the Father which hath &s;ent me draw him,</HI> Joh. 6.44. How cometh this to pa&s;s? <HI>I have loved thee with an Everla&s;ting love, therefore have I drawn thee.</HI> Now He will carry his work an end in His with a mighty Power, thro' all the backwardne&s;s of their own Spirits:
<PB N="18" REF="001603_0019_0FB3E6B9B4CAA600">
And this is the ground mentioned: P&s;al 111. 4, 5, 9. <HI>The Lord as Merciful and full of Compa&s;&s;ion, He will be mindful of his Covenant for ever: He hath &s;ent Redemption to his People, and commandeth his Covenant for ever.</HI> And how cometh this to pa&s;s? His Redeeming love is the cau&s;e of it; as the Covenant of works &s;pringeth from his Ju&s;tice; and hence it is that the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.12. <HI>The Commandment is holy and ju&s;t and good;</HI> if the Creature keep Covenant, the Lord will reward; but if not He will puni&s;h; but to whom his Covenant is from love and mercy, them he will draw with Everla&s;ting Mercy.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another principal Rea&s;on is taken from the Surety; though the I&s;raelites had <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> for a Mediator, yet they had him not for a Surety. Now Je&s;us Chri&s;t is made the Surety of the Co|venant, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.6. A Surety is not for a Te&s;ta|ment, but for a Covenant; no need is of a Sure|ty on God's part, He never brake Covenant with any: but if a Surety be needful, doubtle&s;s it ly|eth on our part; and therefore it is &s;aid, <HI>I will give thee for a Covenant,</HI> even Chri&s;t Him&s;elf: I&s;ai. 55.2, 3. <HI>I will make an everla&s;ting Covenant with thee, even the &s;ure Mercies of David: Behold, I have given him for a witne&s;s to the People.</HI> And hence it is that all the Promi&s;es of this Covenant are made directly to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the Old Co|venant was made to the People, but this is made to Chri&s;t. To <HI>Abraham</HI> and to his Seed were Promi&s;es made, he &s;peaketh not of his Seeds, as
<PB N="19" REF="001603_0020_0FB3E6BAF4D1BA80">
of many, but as of One even Chri&s;t, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.16. And in Him the Promi&s;es are yea and Amen to us; yea, that is affirmed, <HI>Amen;</HI> that is, con|firmed: &s;o long therefore as this Church keepeth her to Chri&s;t, and holdeth Chri&s;t for her Head and Husband, the Lord doth keep Covenant; and he hath Promi&s;ed to the Elect Seed, That they &s;hall keep Covenant, for he hath &s;aid, They &s;hall not depart from Chri&s;t, and then they can never depart from the Covenant, and tho' they break Covenant, yet if they keep clo&s;e unto Chri&s;t, they have the Covenant, although they break it. And tho' you read of a Temporary faith, that doth endure for a &s;ea&s;on, <HI>Matt.</HI> 13.20, 21. And &s;o in the parallel place, <HI>Luk.</HI> 3 13. You &s;hall read. That they are of the Stony Soyl, that receive the word with joy, and for a time believe; and &s;o for a time receive &s;undry Spiri|tual gifts, and that with joy; and &s;ome with fear and trembling al&s;o, as the thorny Soyl, for they want not depth of Earth, but are deeply humbled, and yet bring forth no fruit unto per|fection, becau&s;e they are not brought to that faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t by which they are Sanctifi|ed. Now therefore &s;o long as this Covenant is kept, and &s;o long as the Members of the Church keep clo&s;e to Chri&s;t, &s;o long this Covenant is not broken. And hence it is that when the Jews had committed the greate&s;t Sin that ever was committed upon the face of the Earth, yet the Apo&s;tles did not break Communion with them,

<P>The Elders of the Church propound it, Will you renounce all your Sinful Pollutions? Will you keep Covenant? And enter into a Cove|nant with the Church, and take Chri&s;t, and pro|mi&s;e to walk after all God's Ordinances? You An&s;wer, All this we will do; all this is no more than the Old Covenant: For you are much de|ceived if you think there was no &s;peech of Chri&s;t in the Covenant of works. What were the Ce|remonies but &s;hadows of Chri&s;t? What was the laying the hand on the head of the Sacrifice, but the laying hold upon Chri&s;t Je&s;us? What was the blood of the Sacrifice? Was it not the blood of Chri&s;t? And what was the Atonement by that blood? Was it not the Atonement which is by Chri&s;t?

No, no, There are no true Servants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but they mu&s;t be drawn out of them&s;elves by a Spirit of Bondage, and unto Chri&s;t by a Spirit of Poverty; and then a Soul &s;eeth there is much in Chri&s;t, but he cannot hope there is any thing for him: Now the Lord doth draw a man on to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and calleth him to believe in Chri&s;t, but yet he is not able to reach Him.

Truly this is no more than the very Covenant of Works, which the People of I&s;rael entred into at <HI>Horeb,</HI> the Lord &s;hook the foundations of their hearts; upon it they entred into a Covenant; <HI>All that God commandeth us, we will hear it and do it;</HI> and if they did offend, they then go to the appointed Sacrifice; and what, &s;aith the Soul in &s;uch a ca&s;e? <HI>I thank God, I find &s;ome Peace to my Con&s;cience.</HI> All this you may do, you may reform your Selves and Families, and Churches; and when you fail at any time, you may return to Chri&s;t, and He may give you &s;ome remor&s;e, as he did to the I&s;raelites, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78.34, 35, 36.

is with the&s;e men, that have been under a Spirit of Bondage, they will cry hard for Mercy, and Promi&s;e to pay all in time; and now in their dealings with their Brethren, they are full of Sen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, and will not bate an inch of any Covenant; and they will take a man by the throat, tho' it be but for an hundred Pence: and then what &s;aith the Lord of &s;uch a Servant? Oh! thou wicked Servant, I forgave thee that great debt, &s;houlde&s;t not thou have had com|pa&s;&s;ion of thy fellow Servant? he is then wroth, and delivers him up to the tormentors, until he hath paid the utmo&s;t farthing; even &s;o &s;hall my heavenly Father do unto you. When men have received ea&s;e from God, and then are &s;treight laced towards their Brethren, then doth the Lord revoke his Pardon, So that Reforma|tion is no a&s;&s;urance that God hath made an ever|la&s;ting Covenant with us. And mind you fur|ther, All the Graces that you have laid hold upon, have &s;prung from your own Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Thou ha&s;t taken a Promi&s;e, Did it belong to thee? if not it will fail you; you &s;ay you have been humbled, and come to Chri&s;t, and He hath refre&s;hed you, mark where upon it is built; up|on your humiliation? No, but I come to Chri&s;t, Do you &s;o? Who brought you to Chri&s;t? He &s;aith, <HI>No man can come to me except the Father draw him.</HI> Now, come to &s;uch an one, and &s;ay, Go to Prayer; &s;aith the poor Soul, I cannot Pray; Be humbled, I cannot be humbled; apply Pro|mi&s;es,

they belong to any rather than to me: Such a frame of Spirit there is in every one whom the Father draweth: If you come to Chri&s;t by vertue of any thing which is in you, it is but a legal work. And I pray con&s;ider, what it will amount unto, you will find, that the&s;e men will breed di&s;traction in your Churches, &s;uch Members will make no choice how they hear, or how they deal with their Brethren; look to it therefore carefully, when they come into the Church, for otherwi&s;e you will find everla&s;ting confu&s;ion, rather than an everla&s;ting Covenant.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now then, doth the Lord draw you to Chri&s;t, when you are broken in the &s;en&s;e of your own Sins, and of your own Righteou&s;ne&s;s?

If the Lord do thus draw you by his Everla&s;ting Arm, He will put a Spirit into you, that will cau&s;e you to wait for Chri&s;t, and to wait for Him un|til He doth &s;hew Mercy upon you; and if you may but find Mercy at the la&s;t, you will be quiet and contented with it. And whil&s;t you do with Patience &amp; Con&s;tancy wait, you are drawn with Everla&s;ting Love; now you have Chri&s;t in you, though you do not feel him: for as the Earth is hanged upon nothing, <HI>Job</HI> 26 7.

Grace is his, you may &s;afely receive him into your Church fellow&s;hip; and tho' he do neither know Chri&s;t nor his Covenant to be his, yet he will wait for him, knowing there is none in Heaven but Him, or in Earth in compari&s;on of Him. And you &s;hall find &s;uch Meek in Spirit &amp; Merciful, and Mourning for Sin: The&s;e kind of Chri&s;tians will &s;pring &amp; grow, and will not prophane the Covenant of God, nor the Covenant of the Church by any unmerciful Separation. Such neither &s;tray on the right hand nor on the left; but when you do convince them, that they have Sinned again&s;t Chri&s;t and his Church, they will go &amp; complain bitterly of all the wrong they have done to Chri&s;t, &amp; his Church or Covenant, and Mourn for all the Prophanation of his Name: and for the grief that they have put upon the Spirits of his Brethren; and the&s;e are true I&s;ra|elites indeed, in whom there is no guile. Now cometh the Son with his Per&s;onal work, (as he &s;aith, Joh. 6.44. <HI>No man knows the Father but the Son, &amp; be to whom the Son reveals him:</HI>) in which he doth &s;how the Soul, that all this former work was the mighty Hand of God, whereby he hath drawn the Soul unto Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &amp; afterwards doth a&s;&s;ure and clear it unto the Soul in &s;ome mea&s;ure, that this way is the way wherein God leadeth all his Elect Ones. Now where the Son leadeth, the Holy Gho&s;t beginneth to work his proper work in the Soul, and Sealeth all this to the Soul; for the Soul will not re&s;t in a weak

hope that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is his, but doth &s;eek for more &amp; better &s;ecurity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If he have a Promi&s;e never &s;o clear, yet it doth not quiet his Spirit fully, it doth &s;tay him from &s;ink|ing, but not from &s;earching. When <HI>Nathan</HI> told <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 12.13. <HI>The Lord hath put away thy Sin, thou &s;halt not dye;</HI> as plain a Promi&s;e as any could be, and <HI>David</HI> knew that he &s;pake it from the word of the Lord. And what doth he now? Doth that &s;atisfy? No verily. But many men who had run upon a Covenant of works, would have took it to them&s;elves: If they had been humbled, and after received; but a Child of God, tho' a Mini&s;ter &s;hould &s;o convince him, that he could not deny but the Promi&s;e belongs to him, yet he &s;earches further. And &s;o <HI>David,</HI> P&s;al. 51.1. Doth &s;till beg for Mercy, <HI>Have Mercy upon me, O Lord,</HI> &amp;c. Why, had not <HI>David</HI> been told that the Lord had put away his Sins, (for this P&s;alm was Penned when <HI>Nathan</HI> had &s;poken to him, as appears by the title:) What would he have? Surely he &s;aw need of further Mercy; <HI>Make me to hear the voice of joy &amp; gladne&s;s, &amp; e&s;ta|bli&s;h me with thy free Spirit:</HI> And thus he wre&s;tles with God and prays for it; according to what the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks: Eph. 1.13. <HI>In whom after ye believed, ye were &s;ealed with the holy Spirit of Pro|mi&s;e.</HI> And when the Soul hath received this, then doth he Sleep in quietne&s;s, and hath full content|ment, and &s;till he doth yet depend on Chri&s;t Je|&s;us, fearing left he &s;hould grieve &amp; quench the

<P>If this man have broken any Law of God, you &s;hall &s;oon bring him about to &s;ee his Errors; and all this doth &s;hew a man, he is a poor empty Creature; and this Soul is brought lower and lower, and nearer and nearer to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P><HI>USE.

God hath laid hold upon Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t hath laid hold upon me, and this is his &s;tay, &amp; comfort, altho' God make it not to grow. And I be&s;eech you con&s;ider it, all tho&s;e that have temptations to Separation, and &s;ome that have conceits of too much liberty: It is not hearing that makes a man clean, as we may &s;ee, <HI>Act.</HI> 17.32, 33, 34. When they heard the Apo&s;tles &s;peak of the Re&s;urrection from the Dead, &s;ome mocked, and &s;ome &s;aid, we will hear thee again of this matter, and &s;ome clave to him and believed; all that heard him did not cleave to him, but only &s;ome of them. And if you have heard in <HI>England,</HI> you do thereby neither cleave unto your Covenant, nor Order, unle&s;s you partake of the Seals of the Covenant, then indeed you joyn unto them. Now, this is the nature of the comfort of an Everla&s;ting Cove|nant, tho' we fail in Families, and in Churches, yet if Chri&s;t be ours, the Everla&s;ting Covenant is ours. Indeed when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> came and &s;aw the I&s;raelites wor&s;hipping the golden Calf, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32.19. becau&s;e he &s;aw they had broken Covenant with God, therefore he brake the Tables of the Covenant; to &s;hew the Lord would have no fellow&s;hip with them; and if the Covenant had

So in ca&s;e the Church do tolerate the&s;e, that do defile them|&s;elves with any Sinful Pollution, do not I make my &s;elf Unclean now by touching this Church? God forbid, unle&s;s it be by touching them with familiar connivance.

No, no, Brethren, they touch them to the quick, and &s;o recover their Brethren, and deliver their Souls, tho' they be dead and defiled; yet it is not for the People of God to &s;ay, we will touch them; you &s;hall be Unclean if you touch them not: Touch them, how?
