<PB N="11" REF="006848_0009_102A80BC673E0D10">what, or how great, they were. Nor may all the Im|provements of Science, &s;ince his Time, &s;hew us the Na|ture and Manner; the Extent and Degree of 'em. Tho' Philo&s;ophy hath not de&s;crib'd the Rule which the Stars have over terre&s;trial Bodies, yet the Go&s;pel hath &s;etled the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Mini&s;ters <HI>in</HI> his Churches, &mdash; ordained them to have a &s;piritual, pa&s;toral <HI>Rule</HI> over the People; and enjoyn'd the People's Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion to them in the Lord. What their Autho|rity is, and how they are to exerci&s;e it, may be learn'd from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Words to <HI>Peter,</HI> in Mat. 16.19. <HI>I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and what&s;oever thou &s;halt bind on Earth, &s;hall be bound in Heaven; and what&s;oever thou &s;halt loo&s;e on Earth, &s;hall be loo&s;ed in Heaven.</HI> They are con&s;tituted <HI>Stewards</HI> of God's Hou&s;e, to open the Door of Entrance thereinto unto the duely qualified, and to &s;hut it again&s;t the un|worthy and prophane. They have Power to bind on Earth, not by impo&s;ing any Thing as Duty upon Men, which the evangelical Law doth not Command, but by declaring what that obliges them to, and calling them in the Name of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to perform it. They have Power to loo&s;e, not &s;uch as the romi&s;h <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> claimeth of granting <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ations,</HI> but to a&s;&s;ert and maintain our Chri&s;tian <HI>Liberty.</HI> They are to bind by retaining, and loo&s;e by remitting, of Sins. Joh. 20.23. <HI>Who&s;e &s;oever Sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and who&s;e &s;oever Sins Ye retain, they are retained.</HI> They remit and retain Sins, by declaring and applying the Promi&s;es and Threat|nings of the Word; the former to the Penitent, and the latter to the Impenitent: And by admini&s;tring the Sacra|ments and Cen&s;ures of the Go&s;pel.&mdash; They have Autho|rity from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to do &s;uch Things for the Edification of his Churches; and the due Exerci&s;e of it, hath a great Influence into the well-being and flouri&s;hing of them. Mini&s;terial Authority is not to be de&s;pi&s;ed as an empty Name, an in&s;ignificant Power, a Shadow without Sub|&s;tance,
<PB N="12" REF="006848_0010_102A80BF8AF392D8">becau&s;e there is no external Force to abet it, or to avenge Di&s;obedience to it.

Great al&s;o is the Influence of Mini&s;ter's Example upon the Minds and Con&s;ciences and Actions of Men: And unle&s;s it be good, their Doctrine, how true and clear &s;oever, will not lighten them to Heaven. Their vicious Practice will be of more force to lead People a&s;tray, than all their per&s;ua&s;ive Preaching to bring them into the Way of Life.&mdash; The Summer-fruitfulne&s;s, or Winter-barrenne&s;s of the Church; it's peaceful, or troubled, it's healthful or &s;ickly State, may depend as much on the Lives of Mi|ni&s;ters, as the various Sea&s;ons of the Year, and Circum|&s;tances of Men, do on the Starry-Heaven, who&s;e Domi|nion God hath &s;et in the Earth.</P>
<P>4^t^h^l^y, In re&s;pect of the regular and con&s;tant <HI>Cour&s;e</HI> of their Mini&s;trations, the Angels of the Churches are Stars.

This is &s;uch a clear and inconte&s;tible Proof of One original Being, the divine Architect and Ruler of the Univer&s;e, as made the Roman <HI>Philo&s;opher</HI> with good Rea&s;on conclude,
<Q>That whoever thinks, that the won|derful Order, and incredible Con&s;tancy of the heaven|ly Bodies, and their Motions (whereupon the Pre|&s;ervation and Welfare of all Things depend) is not governed by an intelligent Being, Him&s;elf is to be accounted void of Under&s;tanding.</Q> The orderly Behaviour of wi&s;e and faithful Mini&s;ters in the Hou&s;e of God, which is the Church of the living God; their re|gular

If the Stars did not keep in their Orbs, but wander up and down uncertainly, how could Pa&s;&s;engers by Sea, or Land, be directed by them? If Mini&s;ters are <HI>wandering Stars</HI>

<P>The Repre&s;entation made to your Mind of the Work of the Mini&s;try, in it's various Branches, peculiar Diffi|culties, and awful Con&s;equences, excites your anxious Concern, and makes you enter upon it with Fear and Trembling, le&s;t you &s;hould fail of imparting that Light and Influence, and proceeding &s;o regularly and con&s;tantly in the Sphere of your Duty, as may be, in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure, an&s;werable to the important Character of a coele&s;tial Luminary. You can't without Horror think of one Soul's being finally lo&s;t in Error and Sin, thro' your Want of Knowledge or Faithfulne&s;s, in &s;hewing unto Men the Way of Salvation: Nor do you appre|hend the Ca&s;e, as to your&s;elf, will be much le&s;s &s;ad and dreadful, if, after your in&s;tructive Preaching hath lighted others into the Kingdom of Heaven, you &s;hould be ca&s;t into outer Darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>But it relieves your affrighted Spirit, to behold the Stars in the right Hand of Chri&s;t; and to hope in his Goodne&s;s, which he expre&s;&s;ed to his beloved Servant <HI>John,</HI> &s;truck by his maje&s;tic Appearance with great Awe, and fallen at his Feet as dead:&mdash;<HI>He laid his right Hand upon</HI> him, &s;aying, <HI>Fear not; I am the fir&s;t and the la&s;t: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the Keys of Hell and of Death.</HI>
