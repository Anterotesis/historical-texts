</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Author of mankind hath &s;een fit to give us &s;uch &s;ocial capacities, and form us for a con&s;titution, under which we are &s;o nece&s;&s;a|rily dependent on one another, that no one can act again&s;t the intere&s;t of his community without endangering his own happine&s;s. He hath laid us under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations, by the mutual ties of the benefit of &s;ociety and our own good, to ob&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t rules of benevolence, ju&s;tice, and every public virtue. And that we might not be at a lo&s;s to know what is our duty to one another, he hath mercifully given us this plain rule, and fixed the &s;tandard in every man's own brea&s;t, <HI>what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them.</HI> And to enforce this, he hath added the <HI>&s;evere&s;t</HI> threatnings again&s;t it's violators, and every po&s;&s;ible encouragement for it's ob&s;ervers; &s;o that no one, unle&s;s he is under the prevailing influence of an

exceedingly depraved, wicked heart&mdash;and is actuated by a <HI>dete&s;tably</HI> covetous, &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, can plead ignorance of what is right in his common dealings with mankind. And yet how common is it for men, both to their own, and to the detriment of the public, to leap the bounds pre&s;cribed them by this divine law of nature and revelation?&mdash;This was remarkably the ca&s;e with the I&s;raelites&mdash;. After the death of King Solomon, under who&s;e reign, never were a people, perhaps, more united and happy, Rehoboam &s;ucceeded to the throne&mdash;. Under him the people &s;oon grew unea&s;y, complained of their heavy bur|dens; and a univer&s;al murmur aro&s;e, throughout the kingdom&mdash;. Petitions were prefered to the King, but were an&s;wered with no other than tho&s;e irri|tating, afflictive expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>my father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father cha&s;ti&s;ed you with whips, but I will cha&s;ti&s;e you with &s;corpions.</HI> Upon this the people grew de&s;perate, and cried out; <HI>what portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance in the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e: every man to your tents, O I&s;rael: and now David &s;ee to thine own hou&s;e.</HI> Every tribe, Judah and Benjamin excepted, unani|mou&s;ly revolted from him. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ing wars imme|diately commenced between the ten tribes of I&s;rael on the one &s;ide, and the two hou&s;es of Judah, and Benjamin on the other. God made them in&s;tru|ments of puni&s;hment to each other, becau&s;e neither &s;erved him. <HI>The Lord te&s;tified again&s;t I&s;rael, and again&s;t Judah, becau&s;e they hardened their necks, and would not believe in the Lord their God.</HI> And all was a di&s;mal &s;cene of wars, and judgments upon the land, till both Judah and Jeru&s;alem, were &s;o weakened, and de&s;troyed as to become an ea&s;y prey to foreign powers; and the Babylonians made a compleat conque&s;t over them. In the time of their

captivity, while they &s;uffered the mo&s;t cruel &s;er|vitude, and were groaning under the burdens impo&s;ed on them by their new ma&s;ters, they murmured again&s;t GOD, and grew exceedingly vicious among them&s;elves. The cry of their iniquities reached the heavens; and the Lord &s;ent his Servant, Ezekiel, to reprove them for their &s;ins&mdash;. With all the zeal, boldne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s of a Prophet, he lifted up his voice like a trumpet, and pathetically exclaimed again&s;t the &s;ins of Jeru&s;alem, &s;paring no order of men, as all were verily guilty. Their Princes, and Rulers were exceedingly cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive&mdash;they even threw off the natural ties of kindred, <HI>&s;et light by father, and mother, oppre&s;&s;ed the &s;tranger, and vexed the fatherle&s;s, and the widow,</HI> to promote their own honor, wealth and dominion. Their chief men, who ought to have done every thing they could to promote virtue and religion among the people, ca&s;t off the fear of the Lord, de&s;pi&s;ed holy things, and became the &s;ad examples of lewdne&s;s, and abomi|nation&mdash;. Next to the&s;e, he la&s;hes the vices of the Prie&s;ts; for they in Jeru&s;alem were culpable as well as others: <HI>her Prie&s;ts,</HI> &s;aith God, <HI>have violated my law, and profaned my holy things; they have put no difference between the holy and profane&mdash;and have hid their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I am pro|faned among them.&mdash;And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar.</HI> The&s;e, and many other &s;ins, prevailed in Jeru&s;alem; which rai&s;ed the anger, and indignation of the Lord again&s;t them. But it is commonly the ca&s;e in all declen&s;ions, per|haps, in every period of the world, that &s;ome one &s;in is more general, and prevalent than any other, at that time.&mdash;If we attend to the chapter, in which the text is in&s;erted, we &s;hall find this to have been the ca&s;e with the Jews&mdash;Their predominant &s;in,
<PB N="8" REF="015299_0006_0F98CF43062EBBB0">
which the Prophet charges upon every order of men among them, as their circum&s;tances afforded them the opportunity to practi&s;e it, &s;eems to have been, <HI>Extortion;</HI> or internal oppre&s;&s;ion. Which was the more inexcu&s;able in them, as they, at the &s;ame time, were complaining of oppre&s;&s;ion from their enemies&mdash; But &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent is mankind, that the very things they e&s;teem mo&s;t grievous in others, they frequently practi&s;e them&s;elves. So it was with Jeru&s;alem. Her Princes, Rulers, Judges and great men, were like wolves devouring their prey, de&s;troying the people to increa&s;e their own wealth.&mdash;The Prophets pro|phe&s;ied for gain, and &s;tripped the people of their riches, at the &s;ame time they neglected their &s;ouls&mdash; yea, &s;aith the Prophet, <HI>they have devoured &s;ouls, have taken the trea&s;ure and precious things, and made her</HI> (Jeru&s;alem) <HI>many widows in the mid&s;t thereof</HI>&mdash;. "Which they did," &s;ays that learned Expo&s;itor, Mr. Hu&s;t, <Q>one while, by rai&s;ing per&s;ecutions, cutting off hu&s;bands from their wives; another while, and which agrees mo&s;t with the place, per&s;uading, encouraging, and bewitching Zedekiah, and the Princes, and People, to hold out the war, and run all hazards and extremities of that &s;iege, which filled Jeru&s;alem with dead hu&s;bands, and forlorn widows.</Q> <HI>And the people of the land have u&s;ed oppre&s;&s;ion, and exerci&s;ed robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppre&s;&s;ed the &s;tranger wrong fully.</HI> Forgetting this eternal rule of right, <HI>love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf,</HI> they devoured one another, with an in&s;atiable thir&s;t for gain. So that, upon &s;uppo&s;ition, there might be &s;ome individuals, who kept them&s;elves free from their reigning &s;ins, yet, to every order of men among them, taken collectively. the words of our text might &s;utably apply;&mdash;<HI>thou ha&s;t greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and ha&s;t forgotten me, &s;aith the Lord GOD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="015299_0007_0F98CF4485C19648">To draw a parallel between the &s;ins and circum|&s;tances of the Jews and our own, is not my intention. The heavy Judgments, with which we are vi&s;ited, and that cry of extortion, and oppre&s;&s;ion, which rings through the land, a&s;&s;imilaes us in &s;ome degree at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>And now, &s;eeing Almighty God, notwith&s;tanding our exceeding ingratitude, and unthankfulne&s;s toward him, hath given us this day to &s;ee the beginning of a New-Year, can we do better then to turn a&s;ide from our &s;ecular affairs, and employ a few moments in reflecting upon the increa&s;ing, predominant evil, with which we have clo&s;ed the la&s;t?&mdash; O may we humble our&s;elves before God, and devoutly pray for a &s;peedy reformation, that by his &s;ovran, rich grace, we may begin, and end this year in a better manner than we have done the proceeding.</P>
<P>In order to illu&s;trate the &s;ubject, and as much as po&s;&s;ible to accomodate it to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, it will be convenient for us, in the fir&s;t place, to con&s;ider the import of the word, <HI>Extortion.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, to make &s;ome remarks upon the origin of this evil.</P>
<P>Thirdly, to con&s;ider &s;omething of its evil nature, and hurtful tendency.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, let us con&s;ider the import of the word, <HI>Extortion,</HI> made u&s;e of in the text.</P>
<P>In our language, it is not in all ca&s;es, exactly of the &s;ame &s;ignification with the word <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion;</HI> tho' they are both frequently u&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e. <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> is a more general term, and is rather applied to authority, and &s;ignifies various <HI>kinds</HI> of inju&s;tice; &s;uch as unrighteous laws,&mdash;iniquitous taxes&mdash;infringments
<PB N="10" REF="015299_0008_0F98CF45458EA738">
of liberty, and the rights of con&s;cience&mdash;and all &s;uch impo&s;itions as are inimical to &s;ociety, and contrary to the natural laws of ju&s;tice, and equity. But the word <HI>Extortion,</HI> &s;eems rather limited to the actions of individuals; and is applied to tho&s;e more private advantages which men take of the nece&s;&s;ities of others, in their common dealings, e&s;pecially in ca&s;es of <HI>buying,</HI> and <HI>&s;elling</HI>&mdash;but notwith&s;tanding there may be this difference in &s;trictne&s;s, yet by common u&s;age, they are both frequently applied to the &s;ame purpo&s;es; and &s;ometimes bear the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in &s;cripture, <HI>lev.</HI> 25.14. <HI>If thou &s;ell ought unto thy neighbour, or buye&s;t ought of thy neighbours hand; ye &s;hall not oppre&s;s one another.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, let us make &s;ome remarks upon the origin of this evil.</P>
<P>This evil in &s;trictne&s;s, no doubt takes its ri&s;e from the grand &s;ource of all other &s;ins, the depra|vity of the human heart. This is the root of all our moral calamities. <HI>From whence come wars and &s;ightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lu&s;ts, that war in your members?</HI></P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all our &s;inful actions &s;pring from the &s;ame &s;ource yet they are not all alike. As in the branches of a tree, &s;ome take their more immediate ri&s;e out of others, and make a very different appearance, tho' all are nouri&s;hed by the &s;ame &s;tock, &s;o many &s;ins, take their ri&s;e out of others, and put on different appearances, and yet are all &s;ed by the &s;ame original fountain. To in&s;tance in covetou&s;ne&s;s, and prodigality; &s;ins as unlike as &s;ins can be; the&s;e &s;pring more immediately from dif|ferent hi&s;ts, or inclinations, and yet both are nouri&s;hed from the &s;ame corrupt fountain, a depraved heart.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="015299_0009_0F98CF4605BEB7E8">Extortion &s;eems to be the progeny of an amazing avaricious <HI>lu&s;t</HI> after worldly gain. For an inordi|nate de&s;ire after the world, may as properly be called a lu&s;t, as any &s;in of which mankind may be guilty&mdash;. And &s;o it is denominated in the holy &s;criptures: hence &s;ays the Apo&s;tle James, when &s;peaking of &s;uch; <HI>ye adulterers and adultere&s;&s;es, know ye not that the friend&s;hip of the world is enmity with God? who&s;oever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.</HI> Extor|tion therefore we may conceive, ari&s;es from an in&s;atiable, avaricious de&s;ire of gain; a lu&s;t which &s;educes men into a train of oppre&s;&s;ive actions, and unju&s;t, and iniquitous practices, to increa&s;e their own private intere&s;ts; and betrays a mind, almo&s;t too contracted, mean, and ba&s;e to be called human.</P>
<P>Thirdly, let us con&s;ider &s;omething of the evil nature, and hurtful tendency of Extortion.</P>
<P>To give an adequate idea of the evil nature or to paint the hurtful tendency of this <HI>dete&s;table</HI> practice, language would be in&s;ufficient, and the power of de&s;cription fail. To hint at a few things only, which are plain and obvious to every impar|tial ob&s;erver, is all I &s;hall attempt.</P>
<P N="1">1. Extortion is a breach of the natural laws of ju&s;tice and equity; for the&s;e all require, that in every &s;pecies of dealing with mankind, we &s;hould become mutually advantageous to each other. But the tendency of extortion is to advance a man's own private intere&s;t and bring <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> upon others. He who takes <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of his neighbour, dimini&s;hing <HI>his</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>his own,</HI> by not rendering <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="12" REF="015299_0010_0F98CF46C5D45AF8">
he receives, is a violator of the laws of ju&s;tice and equity. And the man who&s;e impartial con&s;cience cannot an&s;wer in the affirmative to this &s;imple que&s;tion, in every in&s;tance of trade, <HI>have I done, as I would be done by?</HI> mu&s;t plead guilty.</P>
<P N="2">2. Extortion is a violation of the laws of mercy, kindne&s;s, and benevolence. The&s;e all require us to extend our pity and compa&s;&s;ion to our fellow crea|tures. But the Extortioner exerci&s;es none of the&s;e&mdash; His heart, his eyes, his hands, and every bowel of love, and mercy are &s;hut again&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and wants of others; and his ears deaf to all their com|plaints&mdash;He matters not how great a diminution others &s;u&s;tain in their wealth, and happine&s;s, if he can but &s;ecure his own.&mdash; Lo&s;t to every &s;ocial virtue, he puts of the man, and a&s;&s;umes rather the character of &s;ome voracious animal, who, to &s;atiate his own greedine&s;s, would devour all around him. Extortion in a &s;pecial manner, is very unmerciful, and de&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the poor&mdash;<Q>The want of the outward nece&s;&s;aries of life is a &s;ore calamity, and what mercy requires us not only to commi&s;erate; but to do all that is in our power to relieve</Q>&mdash;. The poor are of this denomination&mdash;their circum|&s;tances call for our pity and compa&s;&s;ion&mdash;But what does the <HI>Extortioner?</HI> In&s;tead of affording relief, he adds to their mi&s;eries, and wants. Yea, further, is not Extortion, in a great mea&s;ure, the cau&s;e of their mi&s;ery? does it not bring the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing calamity of pinching want upon thou&s;ands, who otherwi&s;e might have been &s;trangers to &s;uch deep affliction forever! What a &s;hocking reflection doth this afford! What complacency can the Extortioner take in his unju&s;t gain, while many, from whom he has extorted it, and who were intitled to his
<PB N="13" REF="015299_0011_0F98CF478591D3B8">
mercy and compa&s;&s;ion, may be now groaning and dying for want? At lea&s;t it is not owing to his benevolence if they are not. How contrary is this to the rules of the benevolent Go&s;pel; which teacheth us not to be anxious for the meat that peri&s;heth, but to abound in good works, and in the grace of liberality? e&s;pecially to extend mercy to the poor&mdash;<HI>for he that hath pity on the poor lendeth to the Lord</HI>&mdash; And &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed is he who con&s;idereth the poor.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Extortion is a breach of the natural laws of &s;ociety. For it is not only cruel and unju&s;t treat|ment of individuals; but is exceedingly detrimental to the community, by weakening &s;ociety, and en|dangering the &s;tate. The &s;tronge&s;t bond of &s;ociety is mutual intere&s;t. But to this, Extortion is diametrically oppo&s;ed. Sini&s;ter motives are always oppo&s;ed to the public good; but the&s;e are the principles which bias the &s;oul, and influence the conduct of Extortioners. And as Extortion increa&s;es, the public intere&s;t is le&s;&s;ened; as all &s;upplies become proportionably dearer. But be&s;ides this it creates jealou&s;ies, excites feuds, and animo&s;ities, de&s;troys mutual confidence, and becomes the bane of that public union in which chiefly the &s;trength of a State con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Extortioner is a foe to him&s;elf; for by acting again&s;t the community, &s;o far as his influence, and importance extend, &s;o far he endangers his own happine&s;s, by de&s;troying <HI>that</HI> on which the protec|tion of his per&s;on and property depends. So that in <HI>one</HI> view an Extortioner is as much a foe to the public and him&s;elf, as an enemy appearing in open arms; and in &s;ome &s;en&s;e more &s;o; for while the
<PB N="14" REF="015299_0012_0F98CF488853C660">
other &s;hows his intention, he is a more &s;ecret enemy knawing out the bowels under the ma&s;k of a friend; and therefore ought as much to be oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Extortioner is not only a foe to him&s;elf, his neighbour, and his country, but to his GOD; For he, who is &s;uch <HI>a friend of the world, is the enemy of GOD.</HI> He makes the world <HI>his</HI> God, and <HI>for&s;akes the fountain of living waters.</HI> Thus &s;aith the text, <HI>thou ha&s;t greedily gained of thy neigh|bours by extortion, and ha&s;t forgotten me, &s;aith the Lord God.</HI> But further, Extortioners may be &s;aid to forget God, in their violating &s;everal of his particu|lar commands. For in&s;tance, their conduct is a breach of the &s;ixth command; for that <HI>requires every lawful endeavour to pre&s;erve the lives of others as well as of our own.</HI> But they would de&s;troy life, by di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the poor and the needy, the widow and the fatherle&s;s. "The <HI>cur&s;es</HI> of <HI>many</HI> ready to peri&s;h come upon them."</P>
<P>They violate the eightth command, which <HI>requires us to promote the wealth or outward e&s;tate of others.</HI> But they unrighteou&s;ly take it from them, invert the command of the Apo&s;tle, and <HI>look every man on his own things, but not on the things of others.</HI></P>
<P>Once more, they are tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the tenth command, which forbids every &s;pecies of covetou&s;ne&s;s, and manife&s;t an unrea&s;onable, avaricious de&s;ire after the wealth of others: Their covetous hearts know|ing no bounds, like the hor&s;e-leach continually cry <HI>give, give. They are</HI> like <HI>greedy</HI> animals <HI>which can never have enough.&mdash;They all look to their own way, every one for his gain.&mdash;They covet greedily all the day long&mdash;yea al&s;o,</HI> as in the language of the prophet,
<PB N="15" REF="015299_0013_0F98CF4A421DC368">
<HI>they enlarge their de&s;ire as hell, and as death, and cannot be &s;atisfied.</HI> Con&s;equently, they are expo&s;ed to the di&s;plea&s;ure, and judgments of God here, and to his wrath, and eternal indignation hereafter; for no Extortioner &s;hall enter the Kingdom of Heaven. So that let us view <HI>extortion</HI> in what light we plea&s;e, we &s;hall find it dete&s;table in it's nature, and dreadful in it's con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Thus we have con&s;idered &s;omething of the evil nature, and hurtful tendency of the &s;in of extortion, that foe to God and man, which has invaded the land, and with mercile&s;s, unrelenting fury, threatens de&s;truction all around!</P>
<P>Internal oppre&s;&s;ion was not peculiar to the Jews&mdash; Mankind, under like circum&s;tances, are generally the &s;ame&mdash;When opportunities have favored it, <HI>others</HI> have di&s;covered the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, and run into &s;imilar extremes, even the more enlightened age of the world, and the highe&s;t profe&s;&s;ing people not excepted; as the pre&s;ent times are a melancholy witne&s;s! This de&s;troying evil has pervaded our borders; and it's increa&s;ing rapacity has become exceedingly calamitous! The threatning a&s;pect calls upon every friend of God, of ju&s;tice, mercy, and benevolence to ari&s;e, and exert every &s;ocial faculty to &s;top it's progre&s;s.&mdash;The voice of God, more e&s;pecially, calls upon the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as Mo&s;es did upon the children of I&s;rael, when they had made them&s;elves naked with their idolatrous &s;ins; <HI>who is on the Lord's &s;ide? gird on every man his</HI> &s;piritual <HI>&s;word, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and &s;lay every man his</HI> &s;in, and pull down the iniquity that has &s;prung up among us.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="015299_0014_0F98CF4A862DB9E0">Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters are &s;et as centinels upon Jeru|&s;alem's walls; and are under indi&s;pen&s;able obligations to warn the wicked of their danger. The &s;olemn charge to Ezekiel, was in the&s;e words: <HI>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the hou&s;e of I&s;rael: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. When I &s;ay unto the wicked, thou &s;halt &s;urely die, and thou give&s;t him not warning nor &s;peake&s;t to warn the wicked from his wicked way to &s;ave his life: the &s;ame wicked man &s;hall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedne&s;s&mdash;he &s;hall die in his iniquity: but thou ha&s;t delivered thy &s;oul.&mdash;Son of man, I do &s;end thee unto the hou&s;e of I&s;rael; for they have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t me.&mdash; And thou, &s;on of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words,&mdash;nor be di&s;|mayed at their looks&mdash;I do &s;end thee,&mdash;and thou &s;halt &s;peak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear</HI>&mdash;Tho' Chri&s;t's mi|ni&s;ters are not now commi&s;&s;ioned in this extraordinary manner, yet their obligations to be faithful are as &s;olemn, and as binding, as in the prophetic days.</P>
<P>Having this &s;ufficient warrant, I &s;hall endeavour, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>him,</HI> who&s;e cau&s;e I am now pleading, to deliver my &s;oul, and whether you will hear or forbear, plainly, and I hope faithfully, apply the &s;ubject. May the <HI>fear</HI> of GOD ever keep me from <HI>that fear</HI> of man, which <HI>bringeth a &s;nare.</HI> And may that text be ever written upon my heart as with the point of a diamond: <HI>Cur&s;ed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully.</HI></P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, we can be at no lo&s;s for the primary cau&s;es of the reigning &s;in of ex|tortion at the pre&s;ent day. It obviou&s;ly &s;prings
<PB N="17" REF="015299_0015_0F98CF4B6A072BA8">
from that <HI>love of money which is the root of all evil: which while &s;ome covet after they err from the faith, and pierce them&s;elves through with many &s;orrows.</HI> That greedine&s;s of gain,&mdash;that in&s;atiable lu&s;t after the world which induced <HI>I&s;cariot</HI> to betray his Lord and Ma&s;ter, is no doubt an inducement with &s;ome to betray their country&mdash;and as it were, to &s;ell their God.</P>
<P>But let us make &s;ome inquiry into the more external or &s;econdary cau&s;es of this evil, which has occa&s;ioned &s;uch loud complaints; and which threatens us, at this critical period, with internal de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The complaints in the country are chiefly levelled again&s;t the merchants, in the maritime towns;&mdash;that they have taken advantage of the times and laid extravagant prices on almo&s;t every article, which the nece&s;&s;ities of the people have compelled them to purcha&s;e&mdash;. The country perceiving this, and knowing the trading towns could no more &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the produce of the lands, than they them|&s;elves without the wares of the merchant, immedi|ately rai&s;ed the price of almo&s;t every nece&s;&s;ary of life, carried into the markets, as high as the general demand would admit them. This has occa&s;ioned an increa&s;e of extravagance on each &s;ide, till the conduct of both has become exceedingly oppre&s;&s;ive. Taking matters as it were by the gro&s;s, and the&s;e will no doubt be acknowledged, as the more o&s;ten|&s;ible cau&s;es of the pre&s;ent extortion; if we judge of things according to the general complaints. But if we more critically examine the matter, we &s;hall per|haps find, that this evil is not effected by any one cau&s;e alone, but by a number of accidental cau&s;es com|bined together&mdash;. May not the&s;e be the cau&s;es?
<PB N="18" REF="015299_0016_0F98CF4C05D06740">
I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to be judge in the matter; or pretend to determine po&s;&s;itively what are the cau&s;es, but only hint at &s;ome things by way of inquiry. Have not the &s;carcity of wares, and want of employ induced a number to become adventurers in foreign trade; the hazard now being extremely great, and the few comparatively who return with good voyages, have rai&s;ed in&s;urances &s;o very high, be&s;ides all extra-expences in manning and fitting out, &amp;c. which every one knows mu&s;t be much greater than before the war, that hone&s;t trading merchants have been nece&s;&s;itated to advance the prices of goods ob|tained at &s;uch a ri&s;k, and with &s;uch co&s;ts? Not to mention the lo&s;&s;es they have &s;u&s;tained &s;ince the war, by the &s;tagnation of trade, and otherwi&s;e, are not the&s;e rea&s;ons &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify them? The hone&s;t &s;econd-hand dealer may be obliged to advance upon the prices of his goods, as his &s;uppliers advance upon him; and yet compared with other times, and with other things in the pre&s;ent times, his intere&s;t may really &s;ink rather than gain. Now ought we not in ju&s;tice to make great allowances for the&s;e things?</P>
<P>But have not others, who have &s;u&s;tained no &s;uch lo&s;&s;es, nor run any &s;uch hazards, taken advantage of the&s;e things, and extorted in their demands for every article they had to di&s;po&s;e of, merely for the &s;ake of private gain?</P>
<P>Are there not &s;ome, who, &s;eeing the circum&s;tances of the times gave them the opportunity, that peoples nece&s;&s;ities would compel them to purcha&s;e at almo&s;t any rate, have not had virtue enough to with&s;tand the temptation; but deaf to the voice of ju&s;tice, rea&s;on and con&s;cience, and dead to the feelings of benevolence and humanity, have carried their extor|tion to the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible length!</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="015299_0017_0F98CF4CC5E7B030">Are there not &s;ome others, who had large &s;tocks on hand, for which &s;ome might be deeply indebted to merchants abroad, and had it not been for the pre&s;ent unhappy war, before this day might have entered the li&s;t of Bankrupts; who have extorted upon their goods, that they might enable them&s;elves to purcha&s;e the We&s;t-India produce which has been wafted &s;o plentifully into our ports, that they might keep the trade in their own hands, purpo&s;ely to obtain what advances they plea&s;ed?</P>
<P>Again, is it not a fact well known to many in the trading towns, that when foreigners have ri&s;ked a trade with us, and offered their commodities for &s;ale in our ports, at rea&s;onable prices, that &s;ome of the larger trading merchants have purcha&s;ed their whole cargoes; giving not only more than they need to have done, but even more than was demanded; with a view to keep up the value of the goods they had on hand? So much have &s;ome valued their own intere&s;t above the good of the public.</P>
<P>Are not &s;uch monopolizings and fore&s;tallings as the&s;e, the crime of Extortion of the blacke&s;t hue!</P>
<P>But if we revert our thoughts to the country, &s;hall we not find the &s;ame avaricious di&s;po&s;ition equally prevailing in mo&s;t places, in proportion to the trade carried on, and as the circum&s;tances of people give them an opportunity? Does it not &s;eem as if the whole country was contaminated with a &s;pirit of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s? Is there any other difference between the Merchant and the Farmer in this re&s;pect, than what ari&s;es from their different circum&s;tances? Altho' the merchants might have been fir&s;t in this iniquity, yet have not the country people eagerly followed; till both have become jealous of each other,
<PB N="20" REF="015299_0018_0F98CF4D8607E648">
and &s;eem as if re&s;olved, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to out do in Extortion!&mdash; From an impartial inquiry into the&s;e affairs, does it not appear probable, at lea&s;t, that from &s;uch cau&s;es combined this de&s;tructive evil takes it's ri&s;e? And yet, how ready is every one to excu&s;e him&s;elf from blame, and ca&s;t the fault upon others?&mdash; When perhaps, the greater part, if not all who are any ways concerned in trade, whether in Town or Country, are either in a greater or le&s;s degree promoters of this internal oppre&s;&s;ion; in addition to our other calamities. Does not the text therefore &s;eem pertinent to our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, and apply is well to the Farmer, as to the Merchant; <HI>thou ha&s;t greedily gained of thy neighbours by Extor|tion, and ha&s;t forgotten me, &s;aith the Lord God.</HI></P>
<P>Let us next con&s;ider who are the more immediate &s;ufferers by this internal oppre&s;&s;ion. But this is ea&s;ily di&s;cerned&mdash;. Neither the Merchant nor the Farmer, as individuals; for the&s;e are apparently gainers&mdash;and tho&s;e who are employed in public bu|&s;ine&s;s, many of them at lea&s;t, the poor <HI>&s;oldiers</HI> ex|cepted, may find ways and means by their Salaries, Perqui&s;ites, or otherwi&s;e, to add as much to their private intere&s;ts as to balance their own lo&s;&s;es, if not more. None of the&s;e therefore are &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affected by it, as others: but all who depend alone upon fixed &s;alaries, or their own private incomes, having no concern in trade, &amp;c. are immediate and heavy &s;ufferers. Their intere&s;ts are every day &s;ink|ing, and their properties falling by the hand of ex|tortion. In a word, every cla&s;s of men, tho&s;e in public employ or &s;ome trade or other excepted, are &s;uffering under the iron hand of mercile&s;s <HI>internal</HI> Oppre&s;&s;ion. But the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the <HI>Poor</HI> e&s;pecially mu&s;t be inexpre&s;&s;ibly great. I do not mean of every

kind however; &s;ome of the&s;e doubtle&s;s know how to make advantage of the times, as well as other men; and for ought we know, may have as great a hand in Extortion, according to the &s;phere in which they act. It is with them, no doubt, as with &s;ome in higher rank, money never flowed in upon them &s;o fa&s;t before in life.&mdash;But what, my Friends, mu&s;t become of the <HI>Aged</HI> and <HI>Infirm,</HI> the <HI>Widow</HI> and the <HI>Orphan?</HI> What will become of thou&s;ands, who before the&s;e difficulties were but one remove from pinching want? What can they &s;ub&s;i&s;t on now? Will not their complaints reach the Heavens, and bring down the judgments of God &s;till heavier upon us? O where are tho&s;e bowels of mercy, and com|pa&s;&s;ion, which all the ties of nature, humanity, and religion bind us to exerci&s;e toward our fellow-creatures? Are we dead to every tender feeling, and benevolent affection! Are we &s;inking into that hardened &s;tate of the Jews, <HI>when oppre&s;&s;ion &s;wallow|ed up the needy, and made the poor of the land to fail?</HI> Have we not rea&s;on to &s;ay with the Prophet, <HI>we look for judgment, but there is none; for &s;alvation, but it is far from us: For our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions are multiplied&mdash;, and our &s;ins te&s;tify again&s;t us&mdash;. In tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing and lying again&s;t the Lord, departing from the truth, &s;peaking oppre&s;&s;ion and revolt&mdash;Judgment is turned away backward, ju&s;tice &s;tandeth afar off; truth is fallen in the &s;treet, and equity cannot enter.</HI></P>
<P>While the Merchant complains of the Farmer, and the Farmer of the Merchant, are not both enriching them&s;elves with the &s;poils of the poor?&mdash; But the Merchant perhaps will plead, that notwith&s;tanding he has greatly advanced the prices of his wares, yet con&s;idering the circum&s;tances of the times, the lo&s;s of trade, &amp;c. he is not upon the whole a gainer by his traffick&mdash;. The Farmer may likewi&s;e plead, that
<PB N="22" REF="015299_0020_0F98CFFB86512C18">
the wares of the Merchant have ri&s;en more in pro|portion to former prices than the produce of the Farm, therefore notwith&s;tanding the high demands he makes for all <HI>his</HI> vendible articles, yet upon the whole he is not a gainer&mdash;. Now if this be a fact, that both have enhanced the prices of your commodities, and yet neither gain any thing by it, you mu&s;t be the more inexcu&s;able &s;till: for if this be the ca&s;e, then you mu&s;t certainly extort for the &s;ake of op|pre&s;&s;ion, even without a temptation! But this &s;uppo|&s;ition will not readily be granted; therefore admit|ting that neither increa&s;e your real, or per&s;onal e&s;tates, by your pre&s;ent trade, yet it is pre&s;umed you &s;till retain your intere&s;ts by grinding the face of the <HI>poor.</HI> So that view the matter in what light you plea&s;e, you cannot exculpate your&s;elves from blame. What a melancholy ca&s;e is this? Will not the&s;e words of the Prophet apply to us; <HI>the Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people:&mdash;for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the &s;poil of the poor is in your hou&s;es. What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? &s;aith the Lord God of Ho&s;ts.</HI> Are we not the generation, the wi&s;e man &s;peaks of, <HI>who&s;e teeth are as &s;words, and their jaw-teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men?</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the evils that individuals &s;uffer by the pre&s;ent Extortion&mdash;but if we con&s;ider it in a more public view, how greatly does it injure, and en|danger the community? It affects the public in the&s;e &s;everal ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. It di&s;courages, and makes unea&s;y all tho&s;e, who are oppre&s;&s;ed; and has a natural tendency to create di|vi&s;ions, and de&s;troy that harmony and union, in which the &s;trength and happine&s;s of &s;ocieties greatly con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="23" REF="015299_0021_0F98CFFC47A55DF0">2.

And here, if I mi&s;take not, the Extortioner is a &s;inner again&s;t him&s;elf; for to di&s;charge the load he mu&s;t in time, at lea&s;t refund a &s;hare of his unrighteous gain.</P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e things occa&s;ion the Emi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch floods of Paper-Currency, as nece&s;&s;arily depreciates its own value; and &s;o much the more involves the public in difficulty. So that in fact, Extortion mo&s;t rapidly increa&s;es the debt, depreciates the Currency, and &s;inks the credit of the public; and con&s;equently is the greate&s;t impolicy. And unle&s;s a &s;peedy &s;top can be put to its progre&s;s, by &s;ome means or other, it will &s;oon bring inevitable ruin upon the public, and render the increa&s;ing burthens of thou&s;ands quite intolerable!

If <HI>we</HI> are concerned in this abhorred &s;in, let us now pau&s;e a moment, and reflect what an awful thing it is for us to bring &s;uch guilt upon our&s;elves, and upon the land!&mdash; Let me intreat you by every bowel of mercy, and benevolent pa&s;&s;ion, to con&s;ider what you do!&mdash; This life, with all its mo&s;t plea&s;urable enjoyments, is but a vapour: and gain, greedily gotten by extor|tion, is but a trea&s;ure of guilt and mi&s;ery to ac|company you into the eternal world! Will you take &s;o much pains, and &s;eeming plea&s;ure in <HI>that</HI> which mu&s;t co&s;t you the keene&s;t, and mo&s;t bitter repentance in this life; or el&s;e produce a great degree of guilt and angui&s;h to torture you in a world to come! For <HI>the Lord hath &s;poken it, and will not go back;&mdash;nor covetous&mdash;nor extortioners &s;hall inherit the kingdom of GOD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="015299_0027_0F98D00185E5CBD0">But you will plead perhaps, that the Merchants began fir&s;t, and therefore you are not to blame. But will this excu&s;e you? So Eve was fir&s;t in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, but did that excu&s;e Adam, who willingly followed? Will you like him, follow others in ini|quity, and plunge your&s;elves into the &s;ame guilt and mi&s;ery; and then as he did ca&s;t all the blame on others? rather than virtuou&s;ly &s;tand alone? Perhaps, &s;elf-intere&s;t has &s;o bia&s;ed, and prejudiced your minds, that you do not di&s;cern this evil in your&s;elves, tho' you may &s;ee it in others. And &s;ome may argue, that as they are obliged to pay exorbitant prices for what they purcha&s;e, there is no iniquity in a&s;king the like for what they &s;ell. But while there are more purcha&s;ers than venders, this way of rea&s;oning mu&s;t be forever unju&s;t. And if it made as much again&s;t your pre&s;ent intere&s;t as it does for it, would you not readily &s;ee it? Let us &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e. What if the public authority &s;hould encourage the extravagant demands of the Merchants; and at the &s;ame time, force your commodities from you at the former u&s;ual prices? would you not &s;ee the inju&s;tice of this? would you &s;uffer it? would not every mouth be filled with the cry of oppre&s;&s;ion? and every exertion be made to &s;uppre&s;s it? Equal inju&s;tice is now practi&s;ed by the Merchant and Farmer both; and yet you do not feel it, or, if &s;en&s;ible of it, do not reform.</P>
<P>One peculiar aggravation attends this &s;in: If tho&s;e who are guilty of it, &s;hould at la&s;t be &s;o happy, as to find repentance and forgivene&s;s, yet from it's very nature, it will not admit of re&s;titution. How cutting the reflection of a <HI>penitent</HI> ju&s;t going into

eternity, that he cannot right the injuries of the multitude he has wronged by his extortion!</P>
<P>But however willing we are to excu&s;e our&s;elves from blame, do we not &s;ee this &s;in in others, and profe&s;&s;edly abhor it? Are we not then in danger of being numbered with tho&s;e the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of, <HI>who knowing the judgments of GOD, that they who commit &s;uch things are worthy of puni&s;hment,</HI> and yet <HI>do the &s;ame?</HI></P>
<P>But you will &s;ay perhaps, we are not in&s;en&s;ible of the evil; we acknowledge we have been faulty, &mdash;but here we are&mdash;. How &s;hall we go back? or by what means &s;hall we &s;top it's cour&s;e? What will it avail for one to attempt it alone? His con|duct will not influence the whole. The con&s;equence of the attempt, would be his <HI>own</HI> ruin, without effect|ing any good. Each one may therefore &s;ay, it is not my duty to make the trial. If others would reform, &s;o would I&mdash;. This is as much as to &s;ay, when a &s;in is become general, it is no &s;in in an individual to practi&s;e it; or that it is no &s;in to <HI>follow a multitude to do evil.</HI> But what &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed Savior? <HI>If any man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s and follow me.</HI> And he that does not comparatively even hate every worldly comfort, and is willing to forego them <HI>all</HI> for the &s;ake of his duty to God, and his fellow creatures, cannot be Chri&s;t's di&s;ciple. The meaning is, that whenever our Duty and temporal Intere&s;t become competitors, the <HI>latter</HI> mu&s;t give way to the <HI>former. For what is a man profited, if he &s;hall gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own Soul? or what &s;hall a man give in
<PB N="31" REF="015299_0029_0F98D00305730CD0">
exchange for his Soul?</HI> The benevolent Je&s;us gave up even life it&s;elf to redeem us. And yet we are unwilling to give up a little of our worldly intere&s;t to redeem our brethren and country from di&s;tre&s;s. But we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> deny our&s;elves. The voice of rea&s;on and con&s;cience, revelation and ju&s;tice, the cries of the poor, and groans of our bleeding Country all require it! And now, my Friends, you have an opportunity to try your virtue. On the one hand, you have temporal intere&s;t &s;trongly inviting you to comply with the Exorbitancy of the times, on the other, duty to God, compa&s;&s;ion for the poor, regard for ju&s;tice, and love for your country, all urging you to de&s;i&s;t. And now which will you do? Still follow after the <HI>mammon of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> for&s;ake your God, devour the poor, and de&s;troy your country, or nobly di&s;play your virtue, by every exertion, to &s;up|pre&s;s extortion; and put a &s;top to the increa&s;ing calamities in the land? And even reduce your&s;elves to that &s;tate of poverty and want, which many, either do or will &s;uffer, whom you may have oppre&s;&s;ed, rather than violate your duty or deal unju&s;tly with your fellow men. Or, regardle&s;s of all the&s;e benevolent motives, will you like the young man in the go&s;pel, <HI>go away &s;orrowful?</HI></P>
<P>But the que&s;tion &s;till returns, tho' we are all &s;en|&s;ible of the evil, yet how &s;hall a reformation be effected? What can one do alone? It may be re|plied, if you are all &s;en&s;ible of this, you are not alone. Unite therefore in your exertions; fixing it in your minds, that there mu&s;t be a reformation; or el&s;e we are an undone people. <HI>For all the law,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>is fulfilled in one word, even this; Thou &s;halt
<PB N="32" REF="015299_0030_0F98D003C58FDBD0">
love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not con&s;umed one of another.</HI> But do you &s;ay, it is a <HI>difficult thing</HI> to bring about a reformation? and a&s;k how it &s;hall be effected? Let me a&s;k how you came into this way? Did you find <HI>that</HI> a <HI>difficult</HI> thing? Have not many taken pains to find out the highe&s;t pitch of exorbitancy, le&s;t they &s;hould not have an equal hand in it? Are there not many, to their &s;hame, and remor&s;e of their own con&s;ciences, were they not <HI>&s;eared as with a hot iron,</HI> who have hoard|ed up their goods, and withheld &s;upplies even from the nece&s;&s;itous, purpo&s;ely to extort upon them!&mdash; Were half the pains taken, and de&s;ires manife&s;ted to effect a reformation, would it not be done? In|quire therefore how this extortion aro&s;e, and go back the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay perhaps, the evil is now become general; and con&s;equently a &s;top cannot be put to it, unle&s;s the whole are agreed.</P>
<P>It is become too general, we grant, and therefore the more calamitous! But how came this to be &s;o? Was it not produced by the influence of individuals? All public &s;ins become general in the &s;ame way&mdash;. A total declen&s;ion never took place in an in&s;tant. The&s;e evils begin fir&s;t with a few individuals&mdash; and by their influence diffu&s;e them&s;elves, and become general by degrees.&mdash;So it is with reformations: they have always began with individuals. If a reforma|tion was not to commence, without the concurrent voice of the community, we might de&s;pair of it forever. If there is any &s;uch thing as rea&s;oning from
<PB N="33" REF="015299_0031_0F98D00485940250">
Analogy, we can in this way have no rea&s;on ever to expect it. To reform a community is for indi|viduals to begin, and act with all the influence they have. "Such is our &s;tate," as one ob&s;erves, <Q>that each individual has a proportion of influence on &s;ome neighbour at lea&s;t; he on another, and &s;o on; as in a river the following drop urges that which is before; and every one through the whole length of the &s;tream, has the like influence. We know not what individuals may do. We are not at liberty to lie dormant until we can at once influence the whole. We mu&s;t begin with the weight we have. Should the little &s;prings neg|lect to flow till a general agreement &s;hould take place, the torrent that now bears down all be|fore it, would never be formed. The&s;e mighty floods have their ri&s;e in &s;ingle drops from the rocks, which uniting creep along till they meet with another combination &s;o &s;mall that it might be ab&s;orbed by the traveller's foot: The&s;e unite, proceed and enlarge 'till mountains tremble at their &s;ound! Let us receive in&s;truction from the &s;tream.</Q> You know not therefore what you may do till you make the experiment. If you would exert your|&s;elves, unite, combine, exclaim again&s;t the abhorred evil, and manife&s;t your dete&s;tation of it by your own example, who can tell what effect it might have? Should you, with a &s;ingle eye to the honor of God, the happine&s;s of your fellow-creatures, and good of your country, nobly re&s;olve by divine grace to lo&s;e all, &s;uffer every thing, and even become beggars, rather than follow the multitude in &s;in, who knows but thro' your influence a general reformation might take place? And what a glorious thing would that be! You would no doubt be the happier for it to
<PB N="34" REF="015299_0032_0F98D005458164B0">
all eternity! Should you be un&s;ucce&s;sful in the at|tempt, yet &s;till remember it is inexpre&s;&s;ibly better to be &s;ingularly virtuous, than fa&s;hionably vile; and infinitely more glorious to &s;tand alone in a good cau&s;e with a con&s;cience <HI>un&s;potted from the world,</HI> than to follow the current of vice, with numberle&s;s millions for our companions. The te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience in death will be infinitely preferable to thou&s;ands of worlds like this. It will be but a poor con&s;olation in the regions of de&s;pair, that we did but follow the multitude. As the damned are no doubt tormenters of one another, &s;o the more companions there in mi&s;ery the greater will be the &s;ufferings. Dives in Hell deprecated his brethren's coming there, no doubt, le&s;t his own mi&s;ery &s;hould be encrea&s;ed. Be entreated then to take this matter into your &s;erious con&s;ideration, as we mu&s;t all an&s;wer for our conduct at the bar at GOD another day!</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, the public Authority have taken the matter under their con&s;iderations. What will be the re&s;ult of their deliberations and debates upon it we know not.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Since the above di&s;cour&s;e was delivered, the General Court have pa&s;&s;ed an act, regulating all capital articles of trade, and produce of the country; which, tho' it cannot alter the di&s;po&s;ition of the people, yet if &s;trictly ob&s;erved, mu&s;t put a check upon the ruinous avarice, and extortion of the times.&mdash;It affords us a melancholy reflection, that our degeneracy has become &s;o exceedingly great, within the &s;pace of two years, as to require &s;uch an extraordinary mea&s;ure! Nothing but dire nece&s;&s;ity, we may pre&s;ume, would induce the Court to make the attempt.</P>
<P>The operation of this act will, perhaps, for the pre&s;ent, affect the private intere&s;t of &s;ome individuals. But notwith&s;tanding this, whoever con&s;iders the difficulty of framing &s;uch a bill, and at the &s;ame time, the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of it, under our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, if a friend to ju&s;tice, his neigh|bour, and his country, can he do le&s;s than exert him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t to carry it into execution? As few excep|tions perhaps can be taken again&s;t it, as again&s;t any bill of &s;uch a nature, that might be formed.</P>
<P>Can the generous &s;oul, the chri&s;tian, the friend of man, and lover of his country, be &s;o de&s;titute of public virtue, &s;o &s;elfi&s;h, contracted, and unju&s;t, as to &s;ee his neighbour de+voured, the poor of the land fail, and his country &s;ink in ruin, rather than forego a little of his own private intere&s;t to prevent &s;uch amazing calamities! Charity forbids the thought!&mdash;</P></NOTE> Perhaps they will effect more, than
<PB N="35" REF="015299_0033_0F98D006059152D0">
by many is expected. It doubtle&s;s behooves them, I &s;peak with freedom, and boldne&s;s, to mark out the peoples duty by their own Example. And does it not equally become the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, Merchants, Traders, Farmers, and every other de|nomination of men, to rou&s;e up, and exert them|&s;elves to the utmo&s;t, in their particular &s;pheres, to &s;top the growing evil, which threatens de&s;truction to our country? But whatever others may do, let us re&s;olve, thro' Chri&s;t, whatever may be the con|&s;equence, that we <HI>will &s;erve the Lord.</HI> Let what|ever will await us here, let us thro' the Redeemer &s;ecure an intere&s;t in <HI>a better country, even an hea|venly one.</HI></P>
<P>But perhaps all that has been &s;aid will have little or no effect. Our public virtue and true concern for our country may be &s;o weak, our affections and charity &s;o cold; and our temptations, and pa&s;&s;ion for the world &s;o &s;trong and urgent, that after all the warnings we have had, we &s;hall &s;till perhaps continue

in the &s;ame cour&s;e, as did the Jews, till involved in compleat de&s;truction!</P>
<P>But <HI>whether you will hear, or forbear,</HI> God commands his Mini&s;ters <HI>to cry aloud, and not &s;pare to &s;how his people their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</HI> I am com|mi&s;&s;ioned in the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t; and ye are wit|ne&s;&s;es, that I am &s;worn to be faithful.

<P>I therefore again urge your attention to this im|portant affair. The cau&s;e I am pleading is the cau&s;e of GOD, and my country, the cau&s;e of the poor and oppre&s;&s;ed. I am this day an advocate for the poor, the widow, and the fatherle&s;s. My heart akes for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed! I tremble for my Country! and for all of you, my Hearers, who are involved in the general guilt! O my dearly beloved flock, for who&s;e <HI>&s;ouls</HI> I am to <HI>watch, as one that mu&s;t give an account,</HI> be intreated; by the tender mercies of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to come out from among the &s;ins, and abominations of the times, of every deno|mination. Methinks, the voice of God to you is, <HI>come out, my people, from among them, and be ye &s;eparate; touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you. Come out from among them,&mdash;be no longer partaker of their &s;ins, le&s;t ye be partaker of their plagues!</HI> I therefore again be&s;eech your attention to this matter: and urge you, by every bond of chri&s;tianity, equity and ju&s;tice&mdash;by every tender feeling of humanity, and compa&s;&s;ion for the poor; and by every tie of love and friend&s;hip to your country to de&s;i&s;t

from extortion, and oppre&s;&s;ion of every kind! Let the expre&s;&s;ive threatening and encouraging language of the &s;acred &s;criptures, deter you from this evil;&mdash; <HI>For he that by unju&s;t gain increa&s;eth his &s;ub&s;tance, &s;hall gather it for him that will pity the poor.&mdash; Wo to him that coveteth an evil covetou&s;ne&s;s to his hou&s;e,&mdash;that he may be delivered from the power of evil.&mdash;He that oppre&s;&s;eth the poor to increa&s;e his riches, &s;hall &s;urely come to want.&mdash;For the oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor, and the &s;ighing of the needy, now will I ari&s;e, &s;aith the Lord.</HI>&mdash;And <HI>I will be a &s;wift witne&s;s again&s;t tho&s;e that oppre&s;s the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherle&s;s.&mdash;But he that de&s;pi&s;eth the gain of oppre&s;&s;ion, that &s;haketh his hands from holding of bribes, that &s;toppeth his ear from hearing of blood, and &s;hutteth his eyes from &s;eeing of evil: He &s;hall dwell on high: his place of defence &s;hall be the munition of rocks, bread &s;hall be given him, his waters &s;hall be &s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>I would once more urge your mo&s;t &s;peedy and vigorous efforts to &s;uppre&s;s the growing calamity, from a con&s;ideration of the goodne&s;s, and mercy of God toward us thro' the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year, as we would wi&s;h for a more happy one in the en&s;uing. The favor of God hath been extended towards us in numberle&s;s in&s;tances. Have we not been carried thro' another calamitous year; and &s;till live to prai&s;e him, while thou&s;ands, who lived the la&s;t New-Year's Day are no more! What is the language of divine goodne&s;s in this? Is it not expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e words of our Savior? <HI>This is my commandment that ye love one another, as I have loved you.</HI> But where is our love if we bite and

devour one another? Great and important events are before us, which, as &s;ome imagine, will in a great mea&s;ure determine our public controver&s;y, either for or again&s;t us before the year clo&s;es, upon which we have this day entered. Who of us may live to &s;ee it, God alone knows! O let us &s;uffer the things then, which have been &s;ugge&s;ted, deeply to impre&s;s, and affect our minds, as we would hope for the &s;miles of Providence upon us, and our land. O may every one, who has a heart to pray, mo&s;t devoutly &s;olicit the throne of grace, that God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, would pour out a &s;pirit of reforma|tion upon us, and upon our land. For, according to all human probabilities, unle&s;s this takes place, we are a devoted, undone people! Should the time come, in which we &s;hall all &s;ee it, then I tru&s;t you will be witne&s;&s;es for me, that in this particular, I am free from the blood of my Country, and of your Souls.</P>
