<P N="2">II.

All the&s;e left him &s;till under guilt, under the power of &s;in, and in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion near to de&s;pair, till is plea&s;ed God to open his eyes to behold the mercy and comfort of the go&s;pel as the way to holine&s;s and peace; till divine grace brought him, as a dying &s;inner, empty of all good, and helple&s;s, to the full &s;alvation that is in Chri&s;t, and &s;weetly con&s;trained him to receive peace and holine&s;s together; till be learned the way of fanc|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cation by faith and hope in a pardoning God, a God reconciling &s;inners to him&s;elf through Je&s;us the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">edsomer.

<P>Now, though I dare not confine the workings of the ble&s;&s;ed Spi|rit, who is infinitely free and various in his operations, and he hath carried &s;ome thou&s;ands &s;o &s;alvation in a more legal way, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oth daily conform his divine workings in many &s;ouls to their lower de|grees of light and eva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gelical knowledge, as well as to their natural tempers and their temptations; yet it is my judgment, that &s;uch a conver&s;ion of &s;inners, as this author experienced, is always more fre|quent where the go&s;pel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rains in its pure&s;t light and its divine&s;t glory, and &s;eems to be more a-kin to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity.</P>

<P>OF all biography, the lives of eminent &s;aints are, be|yond all controver&s;y, the mo&s;t edifying and u&s;eful; being, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a tran&s;cript of the holine&s;s of God and of his word. Their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ex|ample carries in it &s;uch a &s;ecret and powerful efficacy to make-impre&s;&s;ions on fellow-Chri&s;tians, yea, on all gener|our &s;ouls with whom there is any remains of con&s;cience, that it has oft provoked them <HI>to love and good works,</HI> and by a pions emulation to tread their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">eps, to glorify God, and mend their pace heaven-ward. See Heb. x. 24. Mat. v. 16. 1. Pet. ii. 12. iii. 3.</P>
<P>Without the holy and exemplary lives of the votaries of religion, the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t u&s;ually is &s;o far from gain|ing ground, that it daily lo&s;es the room it has in the world, of which the pre&s;ent melancholy &s;tate of the re|formed churches is too plain a document. I am per&s;uaded, that next to the great out pouring of the <HI>Spirit grow on high,</HI> I&s;a. xxxii. 15. the rapid and admirable &s;ucce&s;s of the glorious go&s;pel, was greatly owing to the holy lives of its profe&s;&s;ors, e&s;pecially their &s;hining in the pe|culiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing duties of Chri&s;tianity, and their cheerful and undaunted boldne&s;s in &s;uffering for Chri&s;t. Therefore, &s;ince in our day the-go&s;pel is &s;o vi&s;ibly de&s;ti|tute of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it advantage to commend the Chri&s;tian re|ligion to the con&s;ciences of all, both friends and foes, we hope the printing of the following &s;heets will not be found un&s;ea&s;onable, when there is &s;o evident, and univer&s;al a decay of the life and power of religion with the truly godly, and &s;uch a prodigious and formidable growth of hypocri&s;y, formality, lukewarmness, and &s;ecurity, &amp;c.

The want of connexion there is oft betwixt purpo&s;es di&s;cour&s;ed by him, was occa&s;ioned partly by the &s;hort Humbers he &s;ome &s;ometimes fell in, his taking &s;ome re|fre&s;hment, and other interruptions, and partly by rea&s;on of different di&s;cour&s;es per&s;ons had to him.</P>
<P>We a&s;&s;ure you, there are very few di&s;cen&s;es he had that are full and complete, as he then &s;poke them.</P>
<P>READER,</P>
<P>There are &s;ome things very obvious, that add a pecu|liar and bright lu&s;tre to the te&s;timony this dying &s;aint and faithful mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t has given to the good ways of God; which &s;hould commend this his &s;wan &s;ong to all.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t,</HI> They are the la&s;t words of one that gives you a rational and di&s;tinct account of the work of God on his own &s;oul &s;ome years ago, and who afterwards, by a holy convincing walk, <HI>adorned the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> and glori|fied his Lord and ma&s;ter, which was his greate&s;t ambition on earth.

<P N="2"><HI>2dly,</HI> This may enhance the value of this te&s;timony, that he was under &s;o great a damp, &s;o dark a cloud, for three or four days before that abundant con&s;olation and joy the Lord &s;illed him with, which you will find narra|ted
<PB N="xiv" REF="030532_0013_0FE7C0CCE2FC4898">by him&s;elf in his dying words.

This glorious method is wor|thy of God, and nobly advances his ble&s;&s;ed de&s;igns about his own.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly,</HI> The con&s;tant and unu&s;ual compo&s;ure of &s;pirit he had is remarkable; though he was under very torment|ing pain, the la&s;t days of his &s;ickne&s;s, yet not one impa|tient word dropt from him; though he &s;lept little the la&s;t five days, and &s;poke much, yet not one raving word was ever heard from him, which as ye will find him oft ad|miring it, &s;o it was a wonder to all that were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4thly,</HI> With what life, what a pecular emotion of &s;pi|rit, what fervour did he utter his la&s;t words? How re|fre&s;hing, affecting and a&s;toni&s;hing this was, all pre&s;ent well remember: And though we had all his dying words, this is &s;till wanting, nor can it be de&s;cribed by us: Now &s;hould not that endear this &s;aint's te&s;timony to religion?</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5thly,</HI> How prudently did he addre&s;s him&s;elf to per&s;ons, mini&s;ters or private Chri&s;tians that vi&s;ited him, according to their various ranks, principles, conditions, and cir|curu&s;tances? He &s;poke with the nice&s;t caution to them, even then, which was very &s;urprizing.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>6thly,</HI> And e&s;pecially that all this was &s;poke by him in view of approaching death, (for neither he nor others conceived the lea&s;t probability of his recovery after he took bed). Death, the king of terrors, the mo&s;t terri|ble of all terribles to an impenitent &s;inner, and that no|thing can make ea&s;y and &s;weeten, but the precious fruits of our Lord's death and &s;ufferings.

How wel|come was it to him? His own words will te&s;tify this. One of the oppo&s;ite way, and not the meane&s;t for &s;en&s;e, &s;aid, he never &s;aw one &s;o willing to die. Now whence is all this?

<HEAD>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE BIRTH, PARENTAGE, AND CHARACTER OF THE REVEREND <HI>Mr. THOMAS HALYBURTON,</HI> With &s;ome other circum&s;tances of his life.</HEAD>
<P>MR. THOMAS HALYBURTON, profe&s;&s;or of divi|nity in the new college at St. Andrews, was born at Duplin, in the pari&s;h of Aberdalgy, December 25th, 1674, of worthy and godly parents, Mr. George Haly|burton and Margaret Playfere. His father was de&s;cend|ed of the family of Pitcur, in the county of Angus; and was mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h of Aberdalgy, in the pre&s;byte|ry of Perth, out of which he was ejected by the then government in the year 1662, as about three hundred more mini&s;ters were al&s;o, &s;ummarily without any legal proce&s;s, &s;imply for non-conformity to Prelacy.</P>
<P>Mr. George Halyburton, who was then bi&s;hop of Dun|keld, and had been an zealous covenanter, &s;uddenly be|came &s;o forward for the national defection, and &s;o cruel a per&s;ecutor of his once fellow pre&s;byters, that he would not &s;pare him more than others, though he was his near kin&s;man, but turned him out of his charge: And yet that prelate was &s;carce well warm in his ne&s;t, when the LORD &s;mote him&s;elf with &s;ore &s;ickne&s;s, of which he died, and went to his place.</P>
<P>Immediately after he was thus per&s;ecuted, that choice and pious gentleman, the &s;ole heritor of the &s;aid pari&s;h, who was one among a thou&s;and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> time, and afterward &s;uffered much for non-conformity, gave him a
<PB N="20" REF="030532_0019_0FE7C0D8E1410BD8">hou&s;e to dwell in at Dupli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, be&s;ide him&s;elf, was his or|cinary hearer, and while he lived, &s;hewed no &s;mall kind|ne&s;s to him, which deferves a thankful remembrance from his relations.</P>
<P>His father never repented his faithfulne&s;s in adhering to the covenanted work of reformation, but rejoiced that he had been honoured to suffer on that account; and when he fell a&s;leep in the Lord, in the year 1682, in the 55th year of his age, he died in the faith of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that God would deliver this church from the then &s;ore per&s;ecu|tion it was under.</P>
<P>His mother was daughter of Mr. Andrew Playfere, the fir&s;t mini&s;ter of Aberdalgy pari&s;h, after the reformation from popery, to whom her hu&s;band &s;ucceeded a little be|fore the re&s;toration of prelacy. She was allied to &s;ome of the be&s;t families of the kingdom by the mother; of which here I &s;hall forbear a particular account: But which was their far greater glory, both of them from their youth up were truly religions.</P>
<P>His mother excelled many of her own &s;ex, for know|ledge of the principles of religion, and an uncommon memory of the &s;criptures; &s;he would have exactly re|peated many of the choice&s;t chapters of the Bible.</P>
<P>They had a numerous family, no le&s;s than eleven chil|dren, and very &s;ickly; all of them died young, except their elde&s;t daughter Jame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and this their &s;on Mr. Tho|mas; but to &s;weeten the&s;e trials, they had peculiar com|fort in the death of their children; &s;ome even of the younge&s;t of them, gave &s;ingular evidences of their dying in the Lord, which &s;ome yet alive well mind.</P>
<P>When his father died, he was happy to be under the care of &s;uch a mother: The epi&s;copal per&s;ecution for non con|formity daily growing, &s;he, with her &s;on-in law and daugh|ter, were forced for their &s;afety to withdraw to Holland, and took him along with them while he was very young: He quickly learned the Dutch, and went to Era&s;mus &s;chool to learn the Latin. There they &s;ojourned till Au|gu&s;t 1687, as which time they returned home, narrowly e&s;caping &s;hipwreck.</P>
<P>At their return he went to the &s;chool, and afterwards to the univer&s;ity, where he made great proficiency beyond

When he had fini&s;hed his cour&s;e there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e entered chaplain to a noble family, where one that had been his &s;chool fellow, and had drunk in the principles of the dei&s;ts, began to attack him on that &s;ide, which obliged him in the beginning of his &s;tudies to read that controver&s;y carefully; and what progre&s;s he made in this, will appear from his book again&s;t the dei&s;ts. He could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> attend le&s;&s;ons of divinity in any of our colleges, while in that family; and though he had read divinity only two years, the pre&s;bytery of Kirkaldy importuned him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ter on trials, and he was licen&s;ed by them to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">, June and, 1699.</P>

<P><PB N="22" REF="030532_0021_0FE7C0DB8D9F7510">
He was naturally of a very plea&s;ant and de&s;irable temper. He had an equal and cheerful temper, which he retained under &s;urpri&s;ing vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itudes. This evenne&s;s of temper appeared much in his frequent and dangerous &s;ick|ne&s;s. He had a calm, peaceable, healing di&s;po&s;ition, and yet bold as a lion in his ma&s;ter's cau&s;e. He had a pecu|liar talent for compo&s;ing of differences: How af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting the pro&s;pect of divitions was to him, the following &s;heets will te&s;tify; And had &s;ome others been ble&s;&s;ed with more of this &s;pirit, his and our &s;ears had been utterly di&s;ap|pointed.</P>
<P>He was ma&s;ter of a con&s;iderable &s;tock of prudence, he &s;tudied to walk in wi&s;dom toward them that are without, and them that are within, and to become all things to all men.</P>
<P>He was dextrous in ob&s;erving tempers, and in addre&s;|&s;ing and managing per&s;ons. How wi&s;ely he carried in church judicatories, whereof he was a member, others can witne&s;s.</P>
<P>He abhorred that unedifying conver&s;e, that is &s;pent in frequent and un&s;ea&s;onable je&s;ting and drollery, &s;o com|mon with many; though he was abundantly facetious in company, when and where he &s;aw it expedient, and in this way &s;ometimes he has dropt what tended to edify. Tho&s;e who conver&s;ed mo&s;t with him, will own, they &s;el|dom enjoyed his company without &s;ome profit by it. He oft was unea&s;y after much conver&s;e with others, if he was not edified him&s;elf, or thought he did not edity others; how circum&s;pect and tender was the &s;train of his walk in this? He oft regretted the difficulty there was to retain integrity in the mo&s;t part of company in this de|generate age; he reckoned &s;uch company a great hard|&s;hip, and loth would he be to have let any thing offen|&s;ive in conver&s;e go without a check.</P>
<P>The following memoirs will witne&s;s his walking with God in his family and clo&s;et: But &s;ome things here I cannot pa&s;s; it was his ordinary, except he had been nece&s;&s;arily hindered, to come from his clo&s;et to family wor&s;hip, e&s; ecially if the Lord had given him enlargement of heart, and if his &s;pirit was in a due frame; he would then have been very unea&s;y, if any interruption fell in
<PB N="23" REF="030532_0022_0FE7C131588EBA58">betwixt clo&s;et and family duties. He al&s;o commonly ex|pounded the word of God, at lea&s;t once a day in his fa|mily. The night before family fa&s;ts, which he kept, or national fa&s;ts, he always directed his &s;ervants how to ma|nage that work, and on the fa&s;t days them&s;elves di&s;cour&s;|ed them about their &s;ouls condition and concerns.</P>
<P>He was an effectionate and dutiful hu&s;band, a con&s;cien|tious and kind parent, a faithful and ea&s;y ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Such as knew him, will own, he had a clear head, a very ready and rare invention, and uncommon memory; he read little after his health broke, and oft owned his greate&s;t improvement was more by thinking than reading.</P>
<P>He had a very ready way of expre&s;&s;ing his thoughts; he was far from a vain, airy affectation of language in preaching, (a prevailing evil in this time), he had &s;tudied an even, neat and &s;criptural &s;tile, and this became natural, though &s;ome thought in the end, his deep thinking made it a little more ab&s;tru&s;e than formerly to a popular auditory.</P>
<P>He had choice pulpit gifts, he was an accurate and pathetic preacher, a great textuary, clo&s;e in handling any truth he di&s;cour&s;ed, and in the application, he was home, warm and &s;earchings and in this he &s;hewed u&s;ually a &s;kilful ca&s;ui&s;t. He oft complained, that &s;ome worthy men were too general and bare in the application of their doctrines.</P>
<P>He ordinarily wrote his &s;ermons very exactly, when health and bu&s;ine&s;s would allow; he u&s;ed to &s;ay, "A lazy mini&s;ter in his younger years would make a poor old man." It were to be wi&s;hed, that this example were more followed than it is. He oft adventured to preach under great indi&s;po&s;ition, when he was not able to write &s;o much as the heads of his &s;ermon, yea, even at &s;acra|ments; and he has been &s;ingularly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, to the convic|tion of all that heard him. In his la&s;t two years he wrote little, his health then was &s;o low.</P>
<P>His experience of the power of godline&s;s, with his o|ther gifts mentioned, made him very &s;kilful to deal with wounded &s;pirits, according to the variety of their ca&s;es; and this conver&s;e he owned was extremly u&s;eful to him|&s;elf. Few mini&s;ters have taken a more cautions and con|firming way of dealing with people, than he did before
<PB N="24" REF="030532_0023_0FE7C0E02DA33658">be admitted them to the &s;acrament; and while in health, he was diligent in the other parts of his ministerial work.</P>
<P>He was no le&s;s &s;ingularly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ted for the &s;chools; he &s;poke elegant Latin promptly, though he had been long in the di&s;u&s;e of it, and was &s;carce at any paies to reco|ver it, which was much admired: He was very expert in the Greek, but his &s;ickne&s;s broke his de&s;ign to accom|pli&s;h him&s;el&s; in the re&s;t of the oriental languages.</P>
<P>In centrover&s;ies, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the time, he ex|celled many. It was &s;trange to &s;ce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow quickly he would have taken up the &s;tate of a controver&s;y, the &s;trength of an adver&s;ary, &s;een through their deceitful &s;ophi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ry and pretences, and how clo&s;e and nervous his rea&s;oning was u&s;ually.</P>

But if I can recount the Lord's gra|cious conduct toward me, the &s;tate of matters before and under the Lord's &s;pecial dealings with me, in a way of conviction, illumination, conver&s;ion, con&s;olation, and edi|fication; and compact them &s;o, as to di&s;cover, not only the parts of this work, the &s;everal advances it made, the oppo&s;ition made to it, its victory over the oppo&s;ition of my own heart, Satan and the world, but al&s;o to pre&s;ent the work in its order and i&s;&s;ue, it may be of great u&s;e to my own e&s;tabli&s;hment: and if ever it &s;hould fall into the hands of any other Chri&s;tian, it might be not unu&s;eful, con&s;idering, that the work of the Lord in all is, as to the &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;ame, and uniform; and <HI>as face an&s;wers to face,</HI> (Prov. xxvii. 19.) in gla&s;s, &s;o does one Chri&s;tian's experience an&s;wer another's, and both to the word.</P>

<P N="2">2. It cannot be expected, that at &s;o great a di&s;tance, I &s;hould remember the particulars of that fir&s;t three or four years of my life; yet I may on the ju&s;te&s;t grounds pre|&s;ume, that they were fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed up with tho&s;e &s;ins that cleave to children in their infancy.

At fir&s;t we are only employed a|bout &s;en&s;ible things, and about them we give the fir&s;t evi|dences that our natures are corrupt. And with the fir&s;t ap|pearances
<PB N="27" REF="030532_0026_0FE7A14C660BE610">of rea&s;on, the corruption of our &s;pirit di&s;covers it&s;elf. How early do our actings di&s;cover pa&s;&s;ion, pride, revenge, di&s;&s;imulation, and &s;en&s;uality, to be inlaid, as it were, in our very con&s;titution? Any ordinary ob&s;erver may di&s;cern in&s;tances innumerable of this &s;ort, very ear|ly in children. With the&s;e and the like evils, no doubt, were the fir&s;t years of my life, whereof I remember lit|tle, filled up&mdash;<HI>Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,</HI> Prov. xxii. 15. <HI>and we go a&s;ide as &s;oon as borns &s;peaking lies,</HI> P&s;al. lviii. 3.</P>
<P N="3">3. In this fir&s;t period of my life, I had advantages a|bove mo&s;t. My parents were eminently religious. I was trained up under their eyes and in&s;pection, for mo&s;t part. I continually heard the &s;ound of divine truths ringing in my ears, in their in&s;tructions; and I had the beauty of the practice of religion continually repre&s;ented to mine eyes in their walk. I was, by their care, kept from ill com|pany that might infect me. By the&s;e means I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> re|&s;trained from tho&s;e gro&s;&s;er out-breakings that children oft run into, and habituated to a form of religion, and put upon the performing of &s;uch outward duties of religion as my years were capable of. Hence it appears, that the &s;in I am now fully convinced that I wallowed in, during this tract of time, is not to be imputed, either as to inclination or actings, merely to contracted cu&s;tom, or occa&s;ional temptations; but it really was the genuine fruit and re&s;ult of that lamentable bia&s;s man &s;ince the fall is born with. Sure the &s;pring mu&s;t be within, when notwith&s;tanding all the care taken to keep me from them, I impetuou&s;ly went on in &s;inful cour&s;es. The holy God hedged up my way by precepts, example, and di&s;cipline; but I broke through all. Sure the &s;pring mu&s;t be within. And &s;ure it mu&s;t be very &s;trong, that was able to bear down &s;uch powerful mounds [fences] as were &s;et in its way, by the providence of God, and run with &s;o full a &s;tream, notwith&s;tanding all outward occa&s;ions of its increa&s;e were cut off, as much as might be. Herein I have full evidence of a heart natu|rally e&s;tranged from, my oppo&s;ite to the Lord. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be|&s;ides, this deeply aggravates my guilt. <Q>And they have turned unto me the back and not the face, though I

<P N="4">4. The care of my father during his life, which ended October 1682, and of my mother after his death, though very great, did not change, but only hide <HI>nature;</HI> which is indeed often hidden, &s;ometimes overcome, &s;eldom ex|tingui&s;hed. Albeit I cannot remember all the particulars from the fourth or fifth years of my life, yet &s;o far I do remember what the general be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of my heart was from that time. Upon a review, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that it was wholly &s;et again&s;t the Lord. <Q>The carnal mind in enmity again&s;t God, it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, nor can it in|deed be,</Q> Rom. viii. 7.</P>
<P N="5">5. To confirm this, when I now &s;urvey the decalogue, and review this portion of my time, notwith&s;tanding of the great di&s;tance, I do di&s;tinctly remember, and were it to edification, could conde&s;cend upon particular in&s;tances of the opposition of my heart unto each of its precepts. Whatever influence ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cation may have in moulding what is &s;een, yet &s;urely <HI>the imaginations of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n's heart are evil from his youth up,</HI> Gen. viii. 21.</P>
<P N="6">6. True it is, through the influence of the means before mentioned, I did all this while abominate the more gro&s;s breaches of all the commands, and di&s;like open &s;in. But meanwhile my heart was &s;et upon the le&s;s di&s;cernible vio|lations of the &s;ame holy law. My quarrel was not with &s;in, but with the con&s;equences of it; and the main thing I regarded was the world's opinion of it. Fear of puni&s;h|ment, pride that fears to be ill thought of, or at be&s;t, a natural con&s;cience enlightened by education, were the only &s;prings of any performance of duty, or ab&s;tinence from &s;in. Prove I was all this while to &s;in, even of all &s;orts, which that age is carried into, in &s;ecret, when I could &s;ay, that <HI>no eye &s;hall &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> me,</HI> Job xxiv. 15.

7. Even tho&s;e things which, in my way, &s;eemed good and promi&s;ing, &s;uch as dete&s;tation of gro&s;s &s;ins, perform|ance of duties, &amp;c, were either purely the effects of a for|cible cu&s;tom, a bribe to a natural con&s;cience to hold its peace, a &s;acrifice to &s;elf, a &s;lavi&s;h performance of what I took no delight in to avoid the whip, or &s;ometimes a charra to keep me from danger, which I thought would befai me, and dreaded much, if I neglected prayer. Thus my be&s;t things dreadfully increa&s;ed my guilt; being like the ap|ples of Sodom, fair to look at, promi&s;ing while untried, but within full of a&s;hes and noi&s;ome matter. <Q>When ye falled and mourned in the fifth and &s;eventh months, e|ven the&s;e &s;eventy years, did ye at all fall unto me?

<P N="8">8. Thus the &s;pring of corruption, dammed in on the one &s;ide, I mean as to open profanity, by the mounds of education, breaks out on the other &s;ide, in a form of religion, (2 Tim. iii. 5.) without, nay plainly oppo&s;ite to the power of it, which is no le&s;s hateful to the holy God: <HI>The prayer of the wicked is &s;in, his &s;acrifice is an abomination,</HI> Prov. xxi. 4, 27. xv. 8. Sin in the one ca&s;e has a lit|tle varni&s;h, that hides its deformity &s;omewhat from the eyes of men; in the other, it is &s;een in its native hue and colours. In the one ca&s;e it runs under ground: In the o|ther it openly follows its cour&s;e. <HI>Some men's &s;ons are open before hand, going before them to judgment, and others follow after,</HI> 1 Tim. v. 26. Whether the one or the o|ther, the odds is not great. <HI>The tree is known by its fruit,</HI> Matth. xii. 33. <HI>A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit.</HI> Sometimes it may bring forth <HI>good-like fruit.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. But yet after all I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that &s;uch was the &s;trength of corruption, that it drove me to &s;everal of the more plain and gro&s;s &s;ins, incident to this age: which though &s;ome account pardonable follies in children, yet the Lord makes another reckoning of them, and &s;undry of them have been made bitter to me; &s;uch as, lying, to a|void
<PB N="30" REF="030532_0029_0FE7C0E9CF2793E0">puni&s;hment, Sabbath-breaking, reveage, hatred of my reprovers, and others of a like nature. Some particular &s;ins committed in childhood, which I had quite forgot as being attended with no notable circum&s;tances, that could make them &s;tick, rather than other things, and be|ing of an older date than any thing el&s;e I can remember, were brought fre&s;h to my remembrance, when the Lord began clo&s;ely to convince of &s;in; and being pre&s;ented in their native colours, in the light of the Lord, and in all the circum&s;tances of time, place, partners in &s;in, &amp;c. and were made the matter of deep humiliation, loathing, and &s;elf-abhorrence, as not only full of wickedne&s;s in them|&s;elves, but pregnant evidences of the deepe&s;t natural de|pravity. Which made me &s;ee to whom it was owing, that I went not to all the heights in wickedne&s;s, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abominations, that ever any were carried to, and which a haeghty heart, if not re&s;trained &s;ea&s;onably, partly by &s;ecret power, and partly by outward means, would inevitably have carried me to. Prov. xxii. 15. <HI>Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,</HI> deeply root|ed and fa&s;tened there. And no thanks to the be&s;t, that they are kept from the wor&s;t things. <Q>And David &s;aid to Abigail, Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of I&s;rael, which &s;ent thee this day to meet me, and ble&s;&s;ed be thy advice, and ble&s;&s;ed be thou, which ha&s;t kept me this day from coming to &s;hed blood, and from avenging my&s;elf with mine own hand.</Q> 1 Sam. xxv. 32. <Q>For in very deed, as the Lord God of I&s;rael liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou had&s;t ha&s;ted and come to meet me, &s;urely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pi&s;&s;eth again&s;t the wall.</Q> What a mon&s;ter had I been, if le&s;t to my&s;elf, and not &s;ea|&s;onably re&s;trained by outward means, and inward power! ble&s;&s;ed be the invi&s;ible hand, and the outward in&s;truments of this re&s;traint, that kept me back from finning.</P>

<P>Reflections on this Fir&s;t Period.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN I con&s;ider how many &s;ins long &s;ince done and forgotten, many of them of an older date than any thing el&s;e I remember, and in their commi&s;&s;ion attended with no &s;uch remarkable circum&s;tances, as can rationally be &s;uppo&s;ed to have made any deep impre&s;&s;ion on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ry, and &s;o have any influence in their recovery, after &s;o long oblivion, were now by the Lord brought to mind with unu&s;ual di&s;tinctne&s;s, I cannot but herein ob&s;erve, 1. What exact notice the holy God takes, and how deeply he re&s;ents tho&s;e things, which men generally will &s;carce allow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> faults, or at mo&s;t but mean ours, pardonable follies rather than &s;ins. God ea&s;ily ob&s;erved, that man's imaginations are evil from his youth, and will have us mind, and be humbled for the &s;ins that have cleaved to us from our youth. <HI>This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyed&s;t not my voice,</HI> Jer. xxii. 21<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is an aggravation of other &s;ins he charges on his people, and in it&s;elf one heavy article. 2.

I here ob&s;erve what an exact regi&s;ter con|&s;cience, God's deputy, keeps; how early it begins to mark, how accurate it is, even when it &s;eems to take no notice, and to what a length it will go in ju&s;tifying God's &s;everity again&s;t &s;inners at the la&s;t day; how di&s;|tinctly and clearly it will read out, and how far up it will fetch its accounts of tho&s;e evils which we mind nothing of, when God &s;hall open its eyes to read what is writ|ten, and di&s;cern tho&s;e p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nts, which, as Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ays, <HI>God &s;ets upon the heels of our feet,</HI> Job xiii. 27. and give it a commi&s;&s;ion to tell us of them, when the <HI>books &s;hall be o|pened, and the dead, &s;mall and great, judged out of them,</HI> Rev. xx. 11.</P>
<P N="2">2. When I review this fir&s;t period of my life, what rea&s;on do I &s;ee to be a&s;hamed and even confounded, to think that I have &s;pent ten years of a &s;hort life, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;t a rational thought, and undoubtedly any that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot &s;inful.&mdash;<HI>After that I was in&s;tructed, I &s;mote upon my thigh: I was a&s;hamed, yea, even confounded, becau&s;e I did bear the reproach of my youth,</HI> Jer. xxxi. 19.</P>
<P N="3">3. The whole of what I have &s;et down before, being matter of undoubted experience, of which I can no more doubt than of what I now &s;ee and feel; I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rein a &s;trong confirmation of my faith, as to the guilt of Adam's &s;in, its imputation to his po&s;terity, and of my concern|ment therein in particular. For, 1. The bent of my &s;oul from a child was &s;et again&s;t the Lord. Nor was this the effect of cu&s;tom and education; for there was a &s;weet con&s;piracy of precept, di&s;cipline, and example of tho&s;e with whom I conver&s;ed, during this fir&s;t part of my life, to carry me another way. Nor can I charge the fault of this on my con&s;titution of body, or any &s;uch thing, as might be alledged to proceed from my parents in a natu|ral way. For tho&s;e Ju&s;ts which are <HI>of the mind,</HI> Eph. i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 3. and are not in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">enced by any con&s;titution of body, were as &s;trong, &s;en&s;ible, active, and prevalent as any o|ther,
<PB N="33" REF="030532_0032_0FE7C13ACAA8FD18">nay, more than the&s;e which may be pretended to depend on the frame of the body. And as my &s;oul in its accur&s;ed inclinations was thus oppo&s;ive to the Lord, &s;o the oppo&s;ition was of that &s;trength and force, as was not to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, much le&s;s to be overcome and &s;ub|dued, by the utmo&s;t care of parents, and the be&s;t outward means. This is undoubted fact. 2. I cannot a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all con|ceive it con&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, or equity of God, to &s;end me thus into the world, without any fault on my part. To &s;ay I was thus originally framed, without re&s;pect to any &s;in chargeable on me, is a po&s;ition &s;o full of flat contrariety to all the notions I can entertain of the Deity, that I cannot think of it without horror, much le&s;s can I believe and give a&s;&s;ent to it. 3. Penal then this corruption mu&s;t be, as death and di&s;ea&s;es are. And where|of can it be a puni&s;hment, if not of Adam's &s;in? While tho&s;e things are &s;o plain in fact, and the deduction &s;o ea&s;y from them, whatever &s;ubtile arguments any u&s;e to over|throw this truth, I have no rea&s;on to be much &s;haken or moved with them, or call the truth in que&s;tion. If once I am &s;ure, that God hath done a thing, there is no room left for di&s;puting its equity. I am &s;ure, I was corrupt from my infancy. I am &s;ure, God could not have made me &s;o without cau&s;e, or &s;ent me into the world in &s;uch a ca&s;e, if it had not been for &s;ome fault wherein I am concerned. If there is any attempt to charge God on this &s;core, I look upon it as highly injurious. There is no more l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ft for me in this ca&s;e, but humbly to endeavour to clear God of any &s;eeming hard&s;hip. If we cannot ea&s;ily do this, then I will much rather own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ignorance, and &s;toop under his incomprehen&s;ibility, than lay any charge of inju&s;tice again&s;t him. This has &s;taid my &s;oul again&s;t the mo&s;t &s;ubtile arguings of men of perver&s;e minds, and even of Satan, who hath oft a&s;&s;aulted me in this in&s;tance. Be their arguments what they will, (Job xxiii. 12, 13, 17.) <HI>Behold in this they are not ju&s;t: I will an&s;wer thee, that God is greater than man. Why do&s;t thou &s;trive again&s;t him? For he giveth not an account of his matters. That he may withdraw man from this,</HI> among other evil purpo&s;es of mea&s;uring God by his &s;hort line, <HI>and hide pride from his eye.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Containing an account of the fir&s;t ri&s;e of my concern about re|ligion, its re&s;ult, revivals, and other occurrences thereto relating, for the fir&s;t two years of this time.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">IN the month of May 1685, my mother being by the heat of the per&s;ecution obliged to retire to Holland, I went along with her. While we were at &s;ea, being in &s;ome real or apprehended danger, my con&s;cience, which had for all the by gone ten years, &s;o far as I can now re|member, been fa&s;t a&s;leep, began to awaken. I was hal|lenged for fin, terrified with the apprehen&s;ions of hell and death, and the wrath of God, which I had no thought about before I was brought to this di&s;tre&s;s: Jer. ii. 27. <HI>They have turned their back unto me, and not their face: Eat in the time of their trouble they &s;hall &s;ay, Ari&s;e, and &s;ave us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. All this concern was nothing more than a &s;ad mix|ture of natural &s;ear, and a &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ire of pre&s;ervation from the danger that was &s;uppo&s;ed imminent, at lea&s;t by me. Peace, acceptance, communion with God, came not much in my thoughts. I was afraid and unwilling to die. I would gladly have been out of danger of hell. This was all my exerci&s;e at this time. It was not &s;in, but death, its con&s;equence, I was concerned to be rid of: Exod. x. 16. <HI>Then Pharaoh called for Mo&s;es and Aaron in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and &s;aid, I have &s;inned again&s;t the Lord your God.&mdash;Now
<PB N="36" REF="030532_0035_0FE7C0F6DFCC9060">therefore I pray thee, forgive my &s;in only this once, and in|treat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me this death only.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. As this exerci&s;e was wholly &s;elfi&s;h, without any con|cern for the Lord's glory, &s;o it led me to &s;elfi&s;h cour&s;es for relief. I promi&s;ed, that were I at land, I would live and be better than formerly. I engaged to keep all God's commands. My mother told me, I was in a mi&s;take, and would not hold there. But there was no per&s;uading one &s;o ignorant of his own heart, as I at this time was, of this. I multiplied engagements, and doubted not my|&s;elf as to the performance: Jo&s;h. xxiv. 16. <HI>And the people an&s;wered, God forbid that we &s;hould for&s;ake the Lord to &s;erve other gods.</HI> Ver. 9. <HI>And Jo&s;hua &s;aid unto the people, Ye cannot &s;erve the Lord; for he is an holy God.</HI> Ver. 21. <HI>And the people &s;aid unto Jo&s;hua, Nay, but we will &s;erve the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. No &s;ooner was I come to land, and fixed at Rotter|dam, but I verified what had been foretold. I forgot all my promi&s;es and re&s;olutions. The unrenewed and cor|rupt heart, being free from the force put upon it by the natural con&s;cience under appearance of hazard, took its old cour&s;e. I returned to former evils, and grew wor&s;e. Corruption, that had been dammed in for a little, having ea&s;ily forced down all the&s;e mounds rai&s;ed to hold it in, run with the greater violence. It is true, through the mercy of God, I was &s;till re&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ined from open &s;candalous &s;ins. Toward which the awe of my godly and prudent mother, and principles of education, did contribute not a little. But as to &s;ecret evils of all &s;orts I had no aver&s;ion to them: Nay, to many of them I was &s;trongly inclined, and in many in&s;tances followed my own inclinations. I was a ready and ea&s;y prey to every temptation, not|with&s;tanding all my engagements; Jer. ii. 20. <HI>And then &s;aid&s;t, I will not tran&s;gre&s;s, when upon every high hill, and under every green tree thou wandere&s;t, playing the harlot.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. My &s;ins, in this place, had this grievous aggravation, that they were again&s;t greater light, and more of the means of grace than I had formerly enjoyed. On the Lord's day we had three &s;ermons and two lectures in the Scots church; on Thur&s;day, a &s;ermon there likewi&s;e. On
<PB N="37" REF="030532_0036_0FE7C14174B25B40">Tue&s;day, one of the &s;uffering mini&s;ters by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rns preached. There was a meeting for prayer on Wedne&s;day. On Monday and Friday's night Mr. James Kirkton common|ly lectured in his family. On Saturday he catechi&s;ed the children of the Scots &s;ufferers who came to him. My mother took care to have me attend mod of the&s;e occa|&s;ions, was careful to keep me to duty, was not wanting in advice, correction, prayer with and for me; &s;he obliged me to read the &s;criptures and other edifying books. But &s;o far were all the&s;e from obtaining a due effect on me, that I was weary of them, and went on in &s;in: I&s;a. v. 4. <HI>What could have been done more,</HI> (viz. in point of outward means), <HI>to my vineyard, that I have not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">? Wherefore when I looked that it &s;hould have brought forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</HI> Mal i. 13. <HI>Ye &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> (viz. of the Lord's &s;ervice), <HI>What a wearine&s;s is in it?

<P N="6">6. At this time I wanted not frequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> convictions, oc|ca&s;ioned &s;ometimes by the preaching of the word, and at other sea&s;ons by the light of my educatica, which &s;till hung about me, and was a check upon me: But all this was only like the &s;tarts of a &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ping man, occa&s;ioned by &s;ome &s;udden noi&s;e; up he gets, but pre&s;ently be is down, and fa&s;ter a&s;leep than before.

<P N="8">8. About the month of December 1686, upon the ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire of my father's &s;i&s;ter, married to John Gla&s;s, provo&s;t of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rth, I was &s;ent home. While I &s;taid in his family, I &s;aw nothing of religion, though my aunt was a woman very moral. Here I was much indulged. I got liberty, and I to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k it. I faw little of the wor&s;hip of God, and I ea&s;ily complied, and turned remi&s;s too. What fur|ther advancer toward an open rejection of the very form of religion, I made in this place, I do not now, at this di&s;tance, di&s;tinctly remember: but no doubt they were great. This I do remember, that I &s;ound my aver&s;ion to the&s;e &s;ins, which through the influence of education I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ominated before, &s;en&s;ibly weakened. Yea, I &s;ound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e &s;ecret hankering after &s;ome of them, a delight in them who were guilty, and a &s;ort of approbation of them in my heart.

Further I mind, that at this time I had a great aver&s;ion to learning, which was the only good thing that in this place was urged upon me. I looked on it as a bur|den and drudgery, to which the ba&s;e&s;t employments were to be preferred, and hence I no way &s;et my heart to it; but trifled my time a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay.

<P N="3">3. Here the Lord ca&s;t my lot under choice means of grace; the mini&s;try of worthy Mr. Thomas Forre&s;ter. Under his &s;earching mini&s;try, the Lord began to give me &s;ome &s;mall di&s;coveries of the more &s;ecret and &s;piritual evils of my heart, and carried me (Ezek. viii. 12.) <HI>into the &s;ecret chambers of imagery,</HI> to let me &s;ee what my heart did <HI>in the dark. 1&s;t,</HI> He opened mine eyes to di&s;cern &s;ome|what of that world of pride that is in the heart, and the wickedne&s;s of it. Though I was &s;ome way convinced of my own weakne&s;s, when I had any difficulty more than ordinary before me, and would &s;eek help from God, yet when I got through, I valued my&s;elf upon my acquittance. Of the wickedne&s;s and unju&s;tne&s;s of this, the Lord in &s;ome mea&s;ure convinced me: I Cor. iv. 7. <Q>What haft thou, O man, that thou haft not received?

<P N="4">4. The&s;e, when added to former di&s;coveries of guilt, gave frequently much di&s;turbance, and ca&s;t me into rack|ing perplexity and di&s;quietment; but the darkne&s;s and en|mity of my mind remaining, I &s;till had recour&s;e to wick|ed and vain cour&s;es for peace, &s;uch as the&s;e formerly mentioned; but they afforded me little quiet. Pharaoh-like, I engaged to amend tho&s;e things wherein formerly I had failed; but, with him, I quickly broke, when the force that drove to this was over. At la&s;t finding no peace in any of the&s;e cour&s;es, I re&s;olved to enter into &s;olemn covenant with the Lord; and accordingly I wrote and &s;ub&s;cribed a &s;olemn covenant, whereby I bound my&s;elf to be for God: like I&s;rael, when under the awful impre&s;&s;ions of Sinai, and the dreadful appearance of God there, I &s;aid, Deut. v. 23, 28. <Q>All that the Lord our God &s;hall &s;ay unto us, we will hear and do it:</Q> And like the &s;cribe that came to Chri&s;t, Luke ix. 57. <Q>Ma&s;ter I will follow thee whitherfoever thou goe&s;t.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5. When I had once done this, then I concluded all was right: For, I. I found a &s;ort of pre&s;ent peace.

I at this time found frequently an unu&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s in hearing of the word; e&s;pecially in hearing Mr. Forre&s;ter lecture on Acta xiii. 53. on the Sabbath night.

The imaginary peace that I had by making this covenant, was quickly lo&s;t by breaking it. Corruption retaining &s;till its power, its locks not being yet cut, whenever a temptation offered; Judges xvi. 21. like Samp&s;on upon a cry of the Phi|li&s;tines being on him, it broke all tho&s;e ties, with which I fooli&s;hly, like his deceived mi&s;tre&s;s, thought it bound: Like the children of I&s;rael at Sinai <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. v. 27. &amp;c. compared with Numb. xxiii. 16. and Numb. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 34.</NOTE>, I engaged fair|ly, and herein thought all right; but when I came to Kibrothhataavah, which was the next &s;tation in their way through the wilderne&s;s, and a temptation fell in my way, I fell a murmuring, loathing the manna, and lu&s;ting after the fle&s;h, and this broke all. The Lord's wrath hereon being afre&s;h intimated again&s;t me, as it was again&s;t them on that occa&s;ion. 2. Not only upon &s;uch breaches met I with challenges, but old ones were revived; and by this I found former accounts &s;till to be &s;tanding again&s;t me, which filled me with con&s;u&s;ion, and jealou&s;ies of the&s;e

Now the Lord gave &s;ome intimations of this heart-treachery, which when further di&s;covered by the event, my covenant could not quiet me about.

<P N="9">9. When I was thus di&s;appointed, e&s;pecially after the making, and frequent repeating of vows and engage|ments, I was ca&s;t into the utmo&s;t perplexity to find where the fault lay.

I could not challenge my&s;elf, at lea&s;t at &s;ome times, for known guile in the making of it. What I en|gaged to do, I was re&s;olved upon at the time.

And though in words I renounced this, yet indeed I &s;ought righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, not in the <Q>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believes,</Q> (Rom. x. 4.) but in my own covenants and engagements; &s;o that I really put them in Chri&s;t's room. 2. Whatever room I, in words, allowed Chri&s;t, as to forgivene&s;s for by gones, yet my peace and hope of it for the future, and &s;o my tru&s;t, was in the evenne&s;s of my own walk. I obtained not righteou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e I &s;ought it <HI>as it were by the works of the law,</HI> Rom. ix. 32. This neglect of Chri&s;t, and &s;huffling my own cove|nents and obedience in his room, was evident; becau&s;e whenever I was challenged for &s;in, in&s;tead of recour&s;e to his blood, I &s;till &s;ought peace only in renewing my vows. 3. The con&s;ent I gave to the law, was not from the reconcilement of my heart to its holine&s;s, but merely, in compliance with the con&s;traint put upon me by my con|victions. But in very deed (Rom. viii. 7.) <HI>the enmity a|gain&s;t it</HI> &s;till continued. And I would not have made it my choice, if that had not forced me to it: &s;o that I &s;ubjected not my&s;elf to it. 4. I engaged to live a new life with an old heart, not being yet made to &s;ee, that <HI>unle&s;s the tree is made good the fruit cannot be good,</HI> Matth. xii. 35.5. <HI>The eye was not &s;ingle,</HI> Matth. xix. 16. vi. 22. All I aimed at was &s;elf, to be ea&s;ed of convictions, and obtain peace from the&s;e racking di&s;quietments I was un|der. I had not the lea&s;t concern for the Lord's glory, provided I were &s;afe. 6. In a word, I engaged before the Lord had thoroughly engaged me. We may be wil|wing <HI>in &s;ome &s;ort,</HI> before the Lord hath made us truly wil|ling. I. John iv. 10. The fir&s;t real kindne&s;s begins on his &s;ide; and we are never engaged to love till the Lord's kindne&s;s do draw us. The force of a &s;trait, by convic|tions, may overpower us into &s;ome preten&s;ions of kind|ne&s;s; thus it was with me. Willing I was to be &s;aved from hell, and to have heaven, under the general notion
<PB N="60" REF="030532_0059_0FE7C16CE1F1ED18">of a good place; but no not to be &s;aved in God's way, on his terms, and in order to the&s;e ends he propo&s;es in the &s;alvation of &s;inner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P N="10">10. This was no my only trouble at this time. Now I was engaged in the &s;tudy of metaphy&s;icks and natural theology, accu&s;tomed to &s;ubtile notions, and tickled with them; whereupon Satan, in conjunction with the natural athei&s;m of my heart took occa&s;ion to ca&s;t me into racking di&s;quietment about the great truths of religion, more e|&s;pecially the being of a God. Thus, in the ju&s;tics of God, that wherein I delighted, I mean &s;ubtile and ab|&s;tract notions, provad the occa&s;ion of much perplexing difficulty to me. For, 1. Some &s;eeming &s;ucce&s;s in my &s;tadies, the fir&s;t year I engaged in the &s;tudy of philo&s;o|phy, fo&s;tered the natural conceit we all have of our own ability to know, and emboldened me to proceed further than was meet. So true in that of the word, 1 Con vlii. 1. <HI>Knowledge puffeth up.</HI> Hereon the natural curi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ity of my vain mind took a liberty to enquire without fear into things too high, and made me promi&s;e my&s;elf &s;atisfaction about them, in and by my own enquiries: Job xi. 12. <HI>Voin man would be wi&s;e, though be in like the wild a&s;&s;es's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lt.</HI> Thus he intrudes into tho&s;e things which he hath not &s;een, Col. ii. 18. <HI>vainly pa&s;t up by his fle&s;hly mind.</HI> 3. And hereon &s;uffering a di&s;appointment, and failing of &s;ucce&s;s, the natural athei&s;m and enmity of my carnal mind, that rather inclines to reject the things of God than our own darkne&s;s, begun, when puzzled, to enquire, <HI>How can the&s;e things be!</HI> John iii. 9.

<P N="11">11. This exerci&s;e about the being of God was much more di&s;quieting than that formerly mentioned.

Now, there were contrary di&s;quieting arguments: Then I was only at that of the di&s;ciples, John xiv. 8. <HI>Lord, &s;hew us the Father, and it &s;ufficeth us:</HI> But now I was di&s;turbed with the working of the <HI>ruler if darkne&s;s,</HI> Eph. vi. 12. <HI>and high imaginations exalting them&s;elves again&s;t God,</HI> 2 Cor. x. 5.</P>
<P N="12">12. Though the athei&s;m and enmity of my heart a|gain&s;t God were &s;till unremoved and great, yet the Lord &s;uffered me not to yield, but made me dread and recoil at the terrible conclu&s;ion aimed at by tho&s;e arguings. For, 1. There remained &s;o much of that natural knowledge of a Deity, which God hath made manife&s;t even in the hea|thens, that is, in their con&s;ciences, Rom. i. 9. and there was &s;o much of &s;trength added to it by the external evi|dence of this truth, by the works of creation and provi|dence, as made me recoil at the thoughts of that horrible conclu&s;ion of the athei&s;t, <HI>There is no God.</HI> 2. Being at the &s;ame time, deeply affected with deep apprehen&s;ions of the &s;hortne&s;s and uncertainty of a pre&s;ent life, I dreaded to admit the conclu&s;ion, that I &s;aw would &s;hake the foundations of any hope of relief for the future from the other &s;ide of time, P&s;al. xi. 3. <HI>If the foundations be de|&s;troyed, what hath the righteous done?</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. In this &s;trait, betwixt light that would not admit of a flat denial of <HI>the being of a God,</HI> and athei&s;m enflam|ed and &s;trengthened by Satan's fiery darts, I betook my|&s;elf &s;till to vain and &s;elfi&s;h cour&s;es. My di&s;turbance was from rea&s;onings, and I thought to relieve my&s;elf by my own rea&s;onings. Nothing more, did I fooli&s;hly think, can be requi&s;ite to e&s;tabli&s;h my mind about this truth, and for ever to quiet my mind in a firm a&s;&s;ent to it, than to obtain demon&s;trative arguments for the being of a God: Thus I thought <HI>by &s;earching to find out God,</HI> Job xi. 7. And like the P&s;almi&s;t, when &s;haken about the providence of God, P&s;al. lxxiii. 16. <HI>I thought to know it.</HI> That is, by own rea&s;onings, I expected to obtain e&s;tabli&s;hment in the truth, and an an&s;wer to the objections urged a|gain&s;t it.</P>
<P N="14">14. Wherefore I &s;eriou&s;ly &s;et my&s;elf to the &s;earch of &s;uch arguments; and I found them; but found not that relief I expected: P&s;al. lxxiii. 16. <HI>When I thought to
<PB N="62" REF="030532_0061_0FE7C174683F48A0">know this, it was too painful for me.</HI> For, 1. The mo&s;t &s;trait|ening and forcible of tho&s;e arguments, proceeding upon the ab&s;urdity of the contrary conclu&s;ion with great evidence, would not allow of any thing to be &s;aid to the argument, and &s;o extorted an a&s;&s;ent: But not enlightening the mind with any &s;atis&s;ying notions and di&s;coveries of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God, whom they obliged me to own as exi&s;tent, my poind was not quieted. For in things of any practical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, without &s;ome competent mea&s;ure of light about for na|ture of things, the &s;oul requiring &s;atisfaction, not only as to their reality, but their meetne&s;s to an&s;wer tho&s;e prac|tical u&s;es whereabout it is concerned, cannot re&s;t without &s;ome di&s;coveries of this: John xiv. 5. <HI>Thomas &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him, Lord, we know not whither thou goe&s;t; and how can we know the way?</HI> 2. The&s;e arguments forced indeed &s;ome a&s;&s;ent in the time: But not di&s;&s;olving contrary ob|jections, whenever the light of them was removed, and contrary objections came in view again, I was intirely &s;haken, like him in Cicero, who read Plato's arguments for the immortality of the &s;oul, and &s;aid, <Q>When I re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d I a&s;&s;ent, but I cannot tell how: but &s;o &s;oon as I lay down the book, all this a&s;&s;ent is gone.</Q> It is faith alone that, as the word is, Heb. xi. I. <HI>reproves</HI> contrary arguings, and plants in the &s;oul an abiding light, that keeps the &s;oul firm in its adherence to truth. Thus, like the philo&s;ophers of old, I Cor. i. 21 <HI>In the wi&s;dom of God, by wi&s;dom I knew not God.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. Though I was thus intangled rather than extrica|ted, by the&s;e &s;elfi&s;h &s;hifts, yet my vain mind &s;till follow|ed the&s;e cour&s;es. For, I. What hitherto I had &s;ailed of, I expected I might find by &s;ome further progre&s;s in learning; and therefore I applied my&s;elf vigorou&s;ly that way. But any little progre&s;s I made, made me &s;till more &s;en&s;ible how far I was di&s;appointed, and made me experience the truth of this, <HI>that he that increa&s;eth know|ledge, increa&s;eth &s;orrow,</HI> Eccl. i. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. The further I pro|ceeded, I &s;till found the more diffculties, and the le&s;s &s;a|tisfaction. When this cour&s;e could not avail, then I &s;pent my weary hours in vain wi&s;hes for &s;ome extraordinary di&s;coveries: Luke xvi. 20. <HI>Nay, but if one ri&s;e from the dead, they will believe.</HI></P>
<P N="16"><PB N="63" REF="030532_0062_0FE7C1CD80ED0F80">
16. Though I reached not the &s;atisfaction I aimed at, yet I cannot but &s;ay this exerci&s;e had &s;ome u&s;eful effects. I. It let me &s;ee, that I had need of &s;ome further evi|dence and e&s;tabli&s;hment about the truths of religion, than hitherto I had either attained or wi&s;t how to attain. Thus I had got &s;ome view of it before: Now I was more con|&s;irmed of. 2. My mind being &s;ometimes more quieted as to the&s;e truths in hearing of the word, than by all my arguments, I was inclined to hope, this evidence I wanted might come from the Lord. 3. I was beat &s;ome|what from that towering opinion of my own knowledge and abilities to know, that my fir&s;t &s;eeming &s;ucce&s;s in in philo&s;ophy gave me, and brought to an u&s;eful diffi|dence of my inability to reach &s;atisfaction, even about natural things, and &s;olve objections that lay again&s;t truths, which yet upon clear argument, I was forced to admit: Which afterwards was of confiderable u&s;e to me.</P>
<P N="17">17. But during this period of time, under ali the&s;e wreitlings and &s;trugglings betwixt growing light and &s;in, corruptions, as I grew in years, grew &s;tronger and &s;tron|ger, took deeper root, and received an increa&s;e of &s;trength by occa&s;ional temptations, and new force from the weak re&s;i&s;tance made to them by the&s;e vain cour&s;es, Rom. vii. 8, 9, 11.

<P N="18">18. Under this perplexity, I betook my&s;elf &s;till to one or other of the fore-mentioned vain cour&s;es: Jer. ii. 36. <HI>I gadded about to change my way, &s;ent to Egypt, went to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssyria, yet could not they help me.</HI> But yet the&s;e exerei&s;es and perolexitics had &s;ome intermi&s;&s;ions, and then I turn|ed remi&s;s and carele&s;s: Ho&s;. vi. 4. <HI>My go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne&s;s, like the morning cloud and early dew, &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed away.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. However, by the&s;e means I was brought to a &s;pecious like form of religion. For now, 1.

When I was en&s;nared, either into the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, or omi&s;&s;ion of duty, I was brought to a deep &s;orrow; and for &s;ome time <HI>walked mournf lly before God,</HI> ibid. 4. Whereas I always had a &s;ort of aw|ful regard for them that &s;eared God, &s;ince ever I began to be in the lea&s;t awakened, now I begun to have a &s;ort of liking and kindne&s;s to them, and plea&s;ure in their company and conver&s;e, even about matters of religion. Thus light forced an approbation of them on my mind, and &s;o to <HI>give glory to God; their light &s;o &s;hining before me,</HI> Matth. v. 16. that I could not but take notice of them. 5. I had frequent <HI>ta&s;tes of the word of God; and the powers of the world to come,</HI> Heb. vi. 5. which made me delight, in approaching to God. And, 6. I got &s;ome things that looked like return of prayer, when, under a &s;en&s;e of im|potency, I betook my&s;elf to God by prayer. In any &s;trait, I found help &s;o remarkable, that I could not but take notice of it. The Lord hereby drew me gradually in to expect good in his way; and, though I was wrong in the main, as it were encouraged the fainte&s;t be|ginnings of a look toward a return. 1 Kings xxi. 19. <HI>And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Ti&s;hbite, &s;aying, See&s;t thou how Ahab humbleth him&s;elf before me: Becau&s;e he humbleth him&s;elf before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: But in his &s;on's days I will bring the evil upon his hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. Now, though by the&s;e means I got a name to live, yet really I was dead: For, 1. The natural darkne&s;s &s;till remained uncured. Some dawnings of light were indeed begun, and &s;ome di&s;coveries made of what formerly I had not known, yet the power of darkne&s;s &s;till remained, and <HI>the vail was not yet taken away, nor were &s;piritual things &s;een in a true light,</HI> 2 Cor. iii. 14, 15. Eph. iv. 18.

The enmity of my mind again&s;t the law <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Compare Rom. vil. 8. with Rom. vii. 12, 22.</NOTE>, e&s;pecially in &s;ome in&s;tances, remained in force; there was not <HI>a re&s;pect to all God's commands,</HI> P&s;al. cxix. 6. I had not yet a &s;ight of the beauty of holine&s;s. Nor did I in my heart approve of the whole yoke of Chri&s;t's pre|cepts, as good and de&s;irable. It was not that I delighted in holine&s;s and conformity to the law, at lea&s;t in &s;ome in&s;tances, but that I was undone without it, that made me aim at any &s;ort of compliance. 3. <HI>I yet &s;ought righ|teou&s;ne&s;s as it were by the works of the law,</HI> Rom. ix. 32.

In a word, all my religion was con&s;trained, violent, &s;elfi&s;h, legal, and anti-evangelical. The&s;e, not to mention other things, were &s;till wrong.</P>
<P>Reflections upon the foregoing exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>IT will not be improper to review the preceding exer|ci&s;e, and offer two or three ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1. The foregoing exerci&s;e affords me full confirmation of many of the truths conte&s;ted by the Pelagians and o|thers, concerning man's inability to good, and the cor|ruption of his nature. When I read and hear their high &s;welling words of vanity, in commendation of man, and in prai&s;e of his free will to good, and his good inclina|tions; and when I hear &s;pecious like arguments offered for proof of the&s;e notions, I have no rea&s;on to be &s;haken. Will they di&s;pute me out of my &s;en&s;es? May I not be|lieve the word? Or ma&s;t I wre&s;t and di&s;tort &s;criptures to make places that appear unfavourable to free will, accord with the&s;e notions of it which &s;ome advance? Sure I am, if they will not allow &s;cripture to be its own interpreter, it is &s;afer, at lea&s;t in the&s;e things that concern our own natural &s;tate, which con&s;cience may know, to admit ex|perience
<PB N="66" REF="030532_0065_0FE7C17B48EC39B8">to comment, rather than rea&s;on proceeding upon ab&s;tract notions: And where &s;cripture and experience join, there we have the fulle&s;t confirmation of the truths that are <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed in the mouth of two &s;uch witne&s;&s;es;</HI> the la&s;t not only confirming, but illu&s;trating the te&s;timony of the former. If they &s;ay that their hearts are not &s;o perver&s;e and ill inclined, and that they find inclinations to good in them, I cannot &s;ay &s;o of mine: Yet by the way I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that is their practice they go &s;eldom further, if &s;o far as others, who agree with me in owning their hearts &s;o wicked, their corruptions &s;o &s;trong, their wills &s;o de|praved, and &s;et upon evil, that they can do nothing well plea&s;ing to God: Now &s;urely, if matters are as they re|pre&s;ent them, they are far to blame. As for me, I find more &s;olid truth in that one &s;cripture, that tells us, that <HI>that the heart is deceitful above all things and de&s;perately wicked,</HI> Jer. xvii. 9. than in many volumes of idle anti|&s;criptural notions, reared up on the &s;ubtile arguings of men, who&s;e eyes have never yet been opened to &s;ee the plagues of their own hearts, and who therefore run out in a&s;&s;erting &s;uch an ability and power, and inclination to good in man, as neither &s;cripture, nor the experience of &s;uch as have their eyes in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure opened, ad|mits of. However, if others will think that there are &s;uch good inclinations in them, I mu&s;t quit my part in them. Wo&s;ul experience convinces me, and obliges me to acknowledge, to my own &s;hame, that I never looked towards the Lord's way, &s;ave when he drew me, Jer. xxxi. 18. <HI>I was as a bullock unaccu&s;tomed to the yoke;</HI> I never went longer in it than the force la&s;ted; I inclined to &s;it down, and &s;at indeed down at every &s;tep&mdash;no great &s;ign I had any heart to the way! I never got up again, but when the Lord's power was anew put forth. I all this while never went one &s;tep but with a grudge, Gen. xix. 26. <HI>I frequently looked back to Sodom; I have been as a back&s;liding heifer.</HI> I was grieved for what I left behind; my heart clave to what my light had the greate&s;t oppo&s;i|tion to: Job xxiv. 13. Thus I was of them that rebel again&s;t the light: I oft refu&s;ed where the command was plaine&s;t; when I was brought into a &s;trait, I betook my|&s;elf rather to any &s;hift than to Chri&s;t; Prov. xxviii. 16. Sin bit me, and yet I loved it; my heart deceived
<PB N="67" REF="030532_0066_0FE7C1D4E11AEE08">me oft, and yet I tru&s;ted in it rather than God: Jer. xvii. 5, 7. God dealt with me in a way of kindne&s;s, but when he &s;poke to me in my pro&s;perity, I would not hear: I&s;a. lvii. 17. <HI>He &s;mote me and I went on frowardly.</HI> I never parted with any &s;in till God beat and drave me from it, and hedged in my way. Surely this looks like <HI>the heart deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked,</HI> Jer. xvii. 9.</P>
<P N="2">2. The foregoing exerci&s;e clears what a depth of de|ceitfulne&s;s is in the heart of man. How many &s;hifts has my heart u&s;ed to elude the de&s;ign of all tho&s;e <HI>&s;trivings of the Lord's &s;pirit with me?</HI> What &s;trange &s;hifts has the heart of man, and how many are they! I have told many, but <HI>the one half is not told.</HI> All the&s;e &s;hifts re&s;pect but one point in religion. If one would undertake to give an account but of tho&s;e deceits, which are more noted, with re&s;pect to the whole of his walk and way, how ma|ny volumes might be written! There is much true di|vinity couched in that &s;hort &s;cripture, Jer. xvii. 9. <HI>The heart is deceitful above all things, who can know it?</HI> P&s;al. xix. 12. <HI>Who can unaer&s;land his errors?</HI> When I upon a review mind &s;o many, how many more might I have no|ticed if I had ob&s;erved them in the time, or &s;oon after? and if &s;o many may be &s;een, how many &s;ecret, undi&s;|cernible, or at lea&s;t undi&s;cerned, deceits are there?</P>
<P N="3">3. How far may we go in religion, and yet come &s;hort? Many things I &s;eemed to have and do: Mark vi. 20. <Q>I did many things, and heard gladly; I was almo&s;t per&s;uaded to be a Chri&s;tian,</Q> Acts xxvi. 28. <Q>I &s;eem|ed to e&s;cape the pollutions that are in the world by the knowledge of the truth,</Q> 2 Pet. ii. 20. <Q>I &s;eemed en|lightened, and partaker of the heavenly gift, and got &s;ome ta&s;tes of the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</Q> Heb. vi. 5. I underwent many changes. and yet all the while was naught, defective as to the main: <Q>Many &s;hall &s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not be able,</Q> Luke xiii. 24. <Q>Not every one that &s;ays, Lord, Lord, &s;hall enter into the kingdom of God,</Q> Matth. vii. 21.</P>
<P N="4">4. I cannot but look back with wonder, to the a&s;to|ni&s;hing patience of God, that <HI>&s;uffered my manners</HI> (Acts xiii. 18.) &s;o long, and the &s;teadine&s;s he &s;hews in pur|&s;uing
<PB N="68" REF="030532_0067_0FE7C17CD50D5FB0">his work, notwith&s;tanding many provocations to de|fi&s;t, <HI>&s;till working for his name's &s;ake,</HI> Ezek. xx. 14. All the creation could not have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">forded &s;o much patience. The di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t would have called <HI>for fire from heaven,</HI> Luke ix. 54. Yea Mo&s;es, the meeke&s;t man on earth, would have found more to irritate him here, than at Meribah, Num. xx. 13. Glory to God, that we have to do with him, and not with man. <HI>His ways are not our ways. Nor his thoughts ours. But as the heavens are high above the earth, &s;o are his ways and thoughts</HI> of mercy <HI>a|bove ours,</HI> I&s;a. lv. 8.</P>
<P N="5">5. I mu&s;t bear witne&s;s to the rationalne&s;s of God's way. For, 1. The&s;e things he put me under concern about, deliverance from wrath, eternal &s;alvation, and &s;ecurity about them, were &s;uch as my own rea&s;on, upon the be&s;t attention, could not but own worthy of the ut|mo&s;t and fir&s;t concern. He did not call me to vex my|&s;elf about-vanity, and the things of no importance. 2. The way he dealt with me in, was not de&s;tructive to the na|ture of my faculties, but improved them. He enlight|ened my eyes to &s;ee what he would have me to do; and he forced, not my will, but &s;wayed it in a way &s;uitable to its nature, to a compliance, &s;o far as I went. This was not to force, but gently to bend the will, to the&s;e things that really were proper for it to incline to. 3. He al|ways ob&s;erved the true order of the &s;aculties. He &s;way|ed the will, &s;o far as it went in compliance with his work, by &s;ending forth his light into the mind, that in the true order of things, &s;hould guide the under&s;tanding. 4. He carried me on to con&s;ideration. He did not &s;eek, as it were, to entangle the affections, and by them carry my mind away in a hurry, as &s;in and Satan are wont to do, who guide &s;inners, as the Phili&s;tines did Samp&s;on, they fir&s;t put out theireyes, and then make them grind in their mill. 5. The Lord never obliged me to part with any way, any &s;in, or refuge I betook my&s;elf to, till he had let. me &s;ee, that it was not only again&s;t my duty, but my true intere&s;t. 6. So far as I complied with his call, I cannot &s;ay that his way was fruitle&s;s, or that he was <HI>a barren wilderne&s;s, or a land of drought,</HI> Jer. ii. 31. The mean|e&s;t and mo&s;t feckle&s;s piece of comphance wanted not its
<PB N="69" REF="030532_0068_0FE7C1DACEA89040">reward; Mal. i. 10. <HI>Who is there among you that would &s;hut the doors for nought: Neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought.</HI> Thus the Lord's work was power, not force. He drew, but it was <HI>with the cords of love, and bands of a man,</HI> Ho&s;. xi. 4. He bid me quit many things, but they were vain things that were no bread, I&s;a. lv. 2. <HI>Remember this and &s;hew your&s;elves men: Bring it again to mind, O ye tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors O hou&s;e of I&s;rael, are not my ways equal? Are not your ways unequal? Yet ye &s;ay, the way of the Lord is not equal,</HI> Ezek xviii. 25.</P>
<P N="6">6. Though it was congruous to rea&s;on, yet it was a work far above the power of nature. I cannot a&s;cribe its ri&s;e or progre&s;s to my&s;elf; for it was what I &s;ought not, I thought not of, I liked not, yea, I hated it, I &s;eared, I avoided, I &s;hifted it; and when all this would not do, I oppo&s;ed it. For I was of tho&s;e <HI>that rebel again&s;t the light,</HI> Job xxiv. 13. I cannot a&s;cribe it to any outward means. There are many parts of it which they did not reach. The mo&s;t fea&s;ible failed; the weake&s;t wrought the effect. Neither &s;trong nor weak, had always the like effect. But the work was carried on by a &s;ecret in|di&s;cernible power of him who is like <HI>the wind blowing where it li&s;teth,</HI> John iii. 8. The work bears an impre&s;s of God in all its &s;teps: the word that awakened me, was the voice of him that makes the <HI>dead to hear,</HI> John v. 25. that <HI>calleth things that are not as if they were,</HI> Rom. iv. 17. The light that &s;hone, was <HI>the candle of the Lord &s;earching,</HI> yea, piercing unto the <HI>hidden parts of the belly,</HI> Frov. xx. 27. tracing a deceitful and un&s;earchable heart into all its turnings and windings, Jer. xvii. 10. The work was that of one who is every where, and who knows every thing, and <HI>is of one mind,</HI> Job xxiii. 13. and &s;o not to be turned; who will not <HI>faint,</HI> nor be <HI>di&s;couraged, till he have brought forth judgment unto victory.</HI> The work is uniform, though variou&s;ly carried on, through many interruptions, over many oppo&s;itions, for a long tract of time, by means &s;eemingly weak, improper and contrary, &s;uitable only for him who&s;e <HI>ways are in the &s;ea, and who&s;e paths are in the great waters, and who&s;e foot&s;teps are not known.</HI> In a word, it was <HI>a bu&s;h burning</HI> and <HI>not con&s;umed,</HI> only by the pre&s;ence of God, Exod. iii. 3. It was a &s;park in
<PB N="70" REF="030532_0069_0FE7C182D1CDF7D8">the mid&s;t of an ocean, maintained, notwith&s;tanding floods continually poured on it to extingui&s;h it. This flame was maintained by oil &s;ecredy conveyed into it, P&s;al. cxviii. 23. <HI>This is the doing of the Lord, and it is wondrous it our eyes.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. WHEN I had &s;tudied philo&s;ophy three years, be|ing tickled with it, and &s;omewhat puffed up with what progre&s;s I had made, and de&s;igned and expect|ed to make&mdash;(though I mu&s;t own that &s;till as knowledge incera&s;ed, &s;elf-conceit decrea&s;ed; and I apprehended I knew more the fir&s;t year than ever I thought I knew af|terwards) &mdash;being thus prepared, I de&s;igned to go abroad, and improve my&s;elf further; to which al&s;o was advi&s;ed. But two things broke this project; my mother would not con&s;ent, and the former exerci&s;e having brought me into bondage through fear of death, I was afraid to run the hazards I mu&s;t run of my life, &s;o long as I was in &s;o un|&s;ettled
<PB N="71" REF="030532_0070_0FE7C1DC5D957898">a ca&s;e as to my &s;oul's &s;tate. Wherefore, upon the motion of &s;ome friends, I con&s;ented rather to engage chaplain to a family for &s;ome time.</P>
<P N="2">2. Accordingly, Augu&s;t 1696, I went to the Weym&s;s'. When I came here, a &s;tranger among&s;t &s;trangers, and per|&s;ons of con&s;iderable quality, by my natural ba&s;hfuln &s;s, the con&s;oriou&s;oefs of my auditors, the publiene&s;s of the appearances I was obliged to make, to which former|ly I had not been accu&s;tomed, my want of breeding, and the like. I was, for a time, in a very great &s;trait, forced to retiredne&s;s, and to petition for help how to car|ry it: And though it was my own, not the Lord's ho|nour I de&s;igned, and was concerned for, yet he that hears the cry of the ravens, Job xxxviii. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P N="3">3. During the fir&s;t half year or &s;o that I was here, I was &s;omewhat diverted from my main work, being obli|ged to &s;tudy what was nece&s;&s;ary for my accompli&s;hment for conver&s;e in the world. But &s;till I held on, and the more difficulty I met with, I kept the clo&s;&s;er to the form of religion I had taken up. Be&s;ides, now my &s;ta|tion called and obliged me to &s;omewhat more. But leav|ing this, which is only introductory, I proceed to that which is mainly and only de&s;igned in this narrative.</P>
<P N="4">4. I had not long been here, when I was often nece&s;|&s;arily, and frequently without &s;ufficient nece&s;&s;ity, engaged in debates about the truth of religion, the divinity of the &s;criptures, and the mo&s;t important doctrines delivered in them, whereby I was drawn to read the writings of de|i&s;ts, and other enemies to religion, that I might be ac|quaint with the arguments, whereby tho&s;e I &s;ometimes had occa&s;ion to di&s;pute with, oppo&s;ed the truth. As to the i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e arguings, with re&s;pect to others, I &s;hall here wave it, becau&s;e others are concerned in it; only I may &s;ay, I found it true, (Tit. iii. 9.) that <HI>fool<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h que&s;|tions, and genealogies, and content on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and &s;trivings about the law, are unpre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">able and vain,</HI> 2 Tim. iii. 13.

<P N="5">5. This was of very dangerous con&s;equence to me, and could not prove otherwi&s;e to one in my ca&s;e. For, I. I was not <HI>rooted and grounded in the truth,</HI> Eph. iii. 17.

The &s;cripture tells them plainly, that if they have a mind to be &s;atisfied as to the truth of the&s;e preten&s;ions, they mu&s;t walk in the way of its procepts to find it, John vii. 17. <HI>If any man will do his will, he &s;hall know</HI> this <HI>doctrine</HI> if it is <HI>of God,</HI> or if <HI>I &s;peak of my&s;elf.</HI> But they walk in a direct contradiction to its precepts, and yet complain of the want of evidence, while they refu&s;e to try that way wherein only it is to be found.

<P N="13">13. Before I leave this, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve &s;ome things which the Lord taught me by this exerci&s;e. 1. I here|by learned the danger and vanity of rea&s;oning with Satan: When I began to an&s;wer him with my own rea&s;onings, he had &s;till great advantage, 1 Pet. v. 9.; he ea&s;ily evad|ed all my arguments, and ea&s;ily repelled my an&s;wers, and enforced his &s;ugge&s;tions, James iv. 7.3. and when his &s;ug|ge&s;tions were to be maintained in point of arguments, he injected them with that impudent violence that I was not able to &s;tand again&s;t, Matth. iv. 10, 11. Our &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e is to <HI>re&s;i&s;t,</HI> and to hold at a di&s;tance, to avoid communing with him, Jude 9. 2. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve like|wi&s;e the wi&s;e providence of God: that the greate&s;t dif|ficulties that lie again&s;t religion are hid from athei&s;ts. All the objections I met with in their writings, were not near
<PB N="79" REF="030532_0078_0FE7C1EB9E97F478">&s;o &s;ubtile, as tho&s;e which were often &s;ugge&s;ted to me: The rea&s;on of it, from the nature of the thing, is obvi|ous; &s;uch per&s;ons take not a near-hand view of religion; and while per&s;ons &s;tand at a di&s;tance, neither are the dif|ficulties that attend it, nor the advantages of it, di&s;cerned. Again, Satan finding all things quiet with them, keeps all &s;o; and finding that they are en&s;nared, he u&s;es not force, Lake xi. 21. It is where he is in danger of lo&s;ing a per&s;on, that he u&s;es his utmo&s;t efforts: when Chri&s;t is ready to ca&s;t him out, then he rages and tears poor &s;ouls, Matth. ix. 29. Be&s;ides, the Lord in his infinite wi&s;dom permits not all the&s;e helli&s;h &s;ubtilities to be publi&s;hed, in tenderne&s;s to the &s;aith of the weak. He that &s;ets bounds to the raging of the &s;ea, and &s;ays, <HI>Hitherto &s;halt thou come, and hore &s;hall thy proud waves be &s;tayed.</HI> Job xxxviii. 11. keeps Satan under chains, and he cannot &s;tep beyond his permi&s;&s;ion, Rev. xx. 1.</P>
<P N="14">14. This exerci&s;e had &s;undry effects upon me&mdash;1.

<P>The devil cannot be at re&s;t, where he hath no mi&s;chief to do to men.

Thus I found it to my co&s;t: For, 1. Satan finding my &s;oul, after all my &s;ad to&s;&s;ings, empty of Chri&s;t, returned. 2.

That which has <HI>the heart</HI> is the <HI>trea&s;ure,</HI> Matth. vi. 21. And the Lord let me &s;ee that my &s;oul was, when all was &s;afe, wholly almo&s;t taken up in viewing with delight the mani|fe&s;tations of his glory in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="10">10. Before I proceed to take notice of any other ef|fects of this di&s;covery, I &s;hall repre&s;ent in a &s;ew particu|culars, the plea&s;ant way where by the Lord carried on this change as to the chief end&mdash;I. When the Lord came to work this change, I was funk under the weighing &s;en&s;e of this, that I had <HI>de&s;troyed my&s;elf,</HI> Ho&s;. xiii. 6. and deeply concerned to know how I might be &s;aved, <HI>ibid.</HI> I&s;a. xlv. 24.2. The Lord made me fir&s;t lock up, by a di&s;covery of &s;alvation and help which an&s;wered my con|cern about my own ca&s;e. 3. When I looked to this &s;alvation, I found <HI>it in him.</HI> 4. When by this means I came to &s;ee his glory &s;hining in the continvance of my &s;alvation, by the lu&s;tre of it I was affected &s;o, that I be|gan to value it above all things, and look on it as of that importance, that, provided it were &s;ecured, <HI>all other things,</HI> the highe&s;t concerns of the creatures not except|ed, were of &s;mall moment, Phil. i.: 9. And, 5. Here|in viewing the glory of his goodne&s;s, in ordering it &s;o, that the creatures in aiming at his glory &s;hould fird their own &s;alvation; this endeared the Lord and his ways ex|ceedingly. Thus the Lord &s;weetly led me, by a view of
<PB N="96" REF="030532_0095_0FE7C1B0552905D0">help &s;uited to my ca&s;e, to a di&s;covery of his glory in my &s;alvation; and helped me to place things, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, at lea&s;t in wi&s;h and de&s;ign, in their own order, and give his glory the pre eininency that was its due. But this only by the bye. Now I go on.</P>
<P N="11">11. A third di&s;cernible effect of this di&s;covery was, with re&s;pect unto the Lord's yoke, his precepts, 2 Cor. iii. 18. beholding his glory, I was changed into his image, and made to look on his <HI>yake</HI> as <HI>ea&s;y,</HI> and his <HI>burden</HI> as <HI>light,</HI> Matth. xi. 30. and to count that <HI>his commaniments</HI> were <HI>not grievous</HI> 1 John v. 3. but <HI>right concerning all things,</HI> P&s;al. cxix. 128. This was very far contrary to my former temper. Now the reality of this change ap|peated and evidenced it&s;elf, even amid&s;t all temptations, &s;lips, yea, and relap&s;es into the &s;atare &s;in, &s;everal ways&mdash; 1. I now came to a fixed per&s;ua&s;ion, that the law was not only <HI>ju&s;t</HI> &s;uch again&s;t which I could make no rea|&s;onable exception; but <HI>holy,</HI> &s;uch as became God; and <HI>good,</HI> Rom. vii. 12. &s;uch as every way was &s;uhed to my true intere&s;t, and peace, and advantage, which I could never think before. 2. Though I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in me oppo&s;ing it &s;till, yet I delighted after to in and man in <HI>the low, as boly, ju&s;t, &s;piritual,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Form. vii. 20, 22.3.

And if the Lord would have given me it in my choice, to have the laws that cro&s;&s;ed them razed, or to let them &s;tand, he knows I would have thought the law le&s;s plea&s;ant, le&s;s perfect, if the&s;e had been wanting, Phil. iii. 7. Thus <HI>what things were gain, 1 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w counted dung,</HI> and endeavoured to <HI>keep my&s;elf from mine iniquity,</HI> P&s;al. xviii. 23. and I could never think my&s;elf happy till the&s;e were <HI>plucked</HI> out, which were before as <HI>the right eye,</HI> Matth. v. 29, 30.6. I took delight in others, or in my&s;elf, only in &s;o far as there appeared any thing of a &s;elf|denied, humble conformity to the law of the Lord, &s;uch I counted as the <HI>excellent of the earth,</HI> P&s;al. xvi. 2, 3. and I was glad when I got near them in any the mean|e&s;t in&s;tance. 7. My &s;oul frequently &s;pent it&s;elf in &s;uch breathings after conformity to the law of God, as the cxixth P&s;alm is filled with throughout, P&s;al. cxix. 5, 20, 33, 112. <HI>O that my ways were directed to keep thy &s;tatutes. My heart breaketh, through the longing it hath to thy com|mands at all times. Incline my heart that I may keep them always unto the end,</HI>&mdash;and the like. 8. This appeared fur|ther, in a fixed di&s;like of the lea&s;t inconformity to the law, either in my&s;elf or others. Now, albeit I was not always &s;uitably affected with my own or other's breach|es, yet this was my burden. I wi&s;hed always that <HI>rivers of tears</HI> might <HI>run down my eyes, becau&s;e</HI> I or other tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors <HI>kept not God's law,</HI> P&s;al. cxix. 136.9. Even when &s;in prevailed, and I was afraid to be ruined, when that <HI>which was ordained for life</HI> oroved <HI>death</HI> to me, even then my liking to the law, and value for conformity con|tinued, all this notwith&s;tanding I con&s;ented to the <HI>law,</HI> that it was <HI>holy, ju&s;t, and good,</HI> Rom. vii. 10, 16.10. The &s;ins which, through the force of temptation, I frequent|ly relap&s;ed into, yet were, and I dur&s;t appeal to the &s;earch|er of hearts as to the truth of this, what <HI>I would not</HI> do: That is, what the con&s;tant <HI>bent of my will</HI> (when not un|der the <HI>immediate force of a temptation,</HI> Rom. vii. 12. when I was not my&s;elf) was &s;et again&s;t. II. Now nothing
<PB N="98" REF="030532_0097_0FE7C1B6B2196C98">appeared more &s;atisfactory in heaven, than a pro&s;pect of being there <HI>&s;atisfied with his likene&s;s,</HI> P&s;al. xvii. 5.12. I looked on the remainder of &s;in, as my greate&s;t mi&s;ery and burden, and that which made me truly a <HI>wretched man,</HI> Rom. vii. 24. and daily cry for deliverance. In aword, I &s;aw that if I could reach conformity to God's law, I would have plea&s;ure, and peace, and liberty, Prov. iii. 17. All wi&s;dom's ways are ways of <HI>peace, her paths plea&s;antne&s;s, her commendments not grievous,</HI> I John v. 3. her yoke light, and nothing unea&s;y, but that remaining en&s;eb|dned corruption, that would not hoop to put its neck un|der the yoke, Matth, xi. 29, 30. This effect was the mo&s;t di&s;cernible of any, under temptations, and has &s;tood me in the be&s;t &s;tead.</P>
<P N="12">12. A fourth di&s;cernible effect of this di&s;covery, was the exerci&s;e of evangelical repentance, which was very different in many re&s;pects from that &s;orrow I before was acquainted with. 1. In its ri&s;e: &s;orrow formerly flowed from di&s;coveries of &s;in, as it brings on wrath, now it flowed from a &s;en&s;e of &s;in, as containing wretched un|kindne&s;s to one, who was a&s;toni&s;hingly kind to an un|worthy wretch. I looked upon him <HI>whom I had pierced, and mourned,</HI> Zech. xii 10. O! what an unkind wretch am I, to provoke &s;uch a God, who has followed me with &s;o much mercy, and yet offers kindne&s;s? 3. <HI>Sor|row</HI> formerly <HI>wrought death,</HI> 2 Cor. vi. 10. alienated my heart from God, and &s;o di&s;pirited for duty, and made me fear hurt from him: But this &s;orrow filled my heart with kindne&s;s to God, to his way, &s;weetened my &s;oul, and endeared God to it. It flowed from a &s;en&s;en of his favour, to an unworthy wretch that de&s;erved none, and was thus a godly &s;orrow leading to kindne&s;s to God, drawing near to him, but with much humble &s;en&s;e of my own unworthine&s;s, like the returning prodigal, when he &s;aw his father coming to meet him, Luke xv. 20, 21.2. The more God manife&s;ted of his kindne&s;s, the more this &s;till increa&s;ed; when he was pacified, I was a&s;hamed and confounded, Ezek. xvi. 63. <HI>After I was turned I repented, I &s;mote noon my brea&s;t, and was a&s;hamed and confounded</HI> for my &s;trayings, Jer. i. 9. The &s;orrow I had before I looked on as a burden, it was nothing but &s;eld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h concern for my own &s;afety, and a fear of being
<PB N="99" REF="030532_0098_0FE7C210F2F063D8">made to &s;eel the effects of a righteous re&s;entment of God. But this &s;orrow was &s;weet and plea&s;ant, as being the exerci&s;e of filial gratitude, and I took plea&s;ure in the &s;urpri&s;ing manife&s;tations of God's favour to one &s;o un|worthy, and in acknowledging my own unworthine&s;s, P&s;al. lxxiii. 22, 23. A &s;en&s;e of my ingratitude, when kept within, covered me with blu&s;hes, and I was ea&s;ed when the Lord allowed me to vent my &s;en&s;e of it, and pour it as it were in his bo&s;om. 5. This &s;orrow was a &s;pring of activity in the way of duty; and I was glad to be employed in the meane&s;t errand that might give opportunity to evidence how deeply I re&s;ented my former di&s;obedience, Luke xv. 19. <HI>Make me as one of thy hired &s;ervants.</HI> 6. In a word, it had all the marks, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, which the apo&s;tle gives of the exerci&s;e of this grace. It was a <HI>godly &s;orrow,</HI> coming from God, it led to God, as always what comes from him in a way of grace, leads to him in a way of duty. <HI>It wrought re|pentance unto life not to be repented of,</HI> 2 Cor. vi. 10. it i&s;&s;ued in a return to the way of life, and to &s;uch a cour&s;e, as upon a review I did not repent of, but delighted in, and defired to be carried further on in. And &s;till in as far as this &s;orrow obtained, there was a liveline&s;s in fol|lowing this way, that leads to &s;alvation or life. It wrought carefulne&s;s to avoid &s;in, and plea&s;e God, indignation a|gain&s;t &s;in, fear of offending God again, vehement de&s;ire of having &s;in removed, the Lord glorified, and obedi|ence promoted: It wrought zeal for God, and revenge again&s;t my&s;elf and &s;in. It was not as former &s;orrow, preg|nant with pride, &s;tiffne&s;s, and unwillingne&s;s to undergo any cha&s;ti&s;ement; but it humbled, &s;oftened the &s;oul, and wrought a willingne&s;s to bear the indignation of the Lord when I had &s;inned again&s;t him. In a word, I was glad when the Lord allowed me any mea&s;ure of it, and griev|ed when I found it wanting, and cried to the Prince ex|alted for it, becau&s;e of the good effects it had, and the real advantage I found by it, with re&s;pect unto the whole of that obedience the Lord requires.</P>
<P N="13">13. A fifth di&s;cernible effect of this di&s;covery was, a humble, but &s;weet and comfortable hope, and per&s;ua&s;ion of my own &s;alvation, an&s;werable to the clearne&s;s of this di&s;covery; that is, ri&s;ing in &s;trength, or growing more
<PB N="100" REF="030532_0099_0FE7C35BC09CA590">weak, and le&s;s di&s;cernible, as the di&s;coveries of the way of &s;alvation were more or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> clear und &s;trong. New becau&s;e this is what I take for go&s;pel a&s;&s;urance, with the worthy Dr. Owen, I &s;hall give &s;ome further account of it, as I found it then and &s;ince.&mdash;I. When the Lord gave this di&s;covery of his way of &s;alvation, he &s;atisfied me, that it was a way full of peace and &s;ecurity, the only &s;afe way whereon I might &s;afely venture; and hereby, as I told formerly, I was &s;ully per&s;uaded, <HI>That this was the way wherein I &s;hould walk,</HI> I&s;a. xxx. 21. Hereby I was tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed from that di&s;quieting &s;ear, that in tru&s;ting to it, I was tru&s;ting to that which would fail. I was &s;atisfied, I could not fail otherwi&s;e than by mi&s;&s;ing this way; I doubt|ed of my&s;elf, but not of the way. 2. The Lord, by the di&s;covery above mentioned, did powerfully draw my &s;oul to clo&s;e with it; and in &s;o far as I have to, and clo&s;ed with this, in &s;o far, con&s;idering the former di&s;covery of the &s;afety of this way, I could not doubt of the i&s;&s;ue, but was &s;weetly &s;atisfied, that my <HI>expectation &s;hould not be cut off,</HI> Prov. xxiii. 18. nor my labour in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain in pur&s;uing this cour&s;e. While I clave to, and repo&s;ed with &s;atisfaction on what I was convinced was &s;afe, I could not, in &s;o far as I leaned to this, but be quiet and compo&s;ed about the i&s;&s;ue. Which &s;hews how nearly allied faith and a&s;&s;urance are, though they are not the &s;ame, and therefore no wonder the one &s;hould be taken for the other. 3. Hereby I was animated to walk on in this way, and follow duty; and finding, as I went on in duty, that &s;o far as I proceeded, my expectation was not di&s;appointed, &s;till according to &s;ucce&s;s, this hope in&s;en&s;ibly and &s;ecretly grew. This God <HI>is our God, we have waited for him, and he will &s;ave us,</HI> I&s;a. xxv. 9.4. This di&s;covery manife&s;ting &s;alvation in a way of &s;elf denial, and tru&s;t only in the Lord, nothing &s;o &s;oon marred this hope, as the lea&s;t appearance of &s;elf, and &s;tirring of pride. Whenever the glory of the Lord was revealed, and he &s;pake peace, I was hereon filled with &s;hame, and the decper this humiliation was, &s;till the humble confidence of my &s;afety increa&s;ed, Ezek. xvi. 63. Now the&s;e two la&s;t remarks &s;hew, how far this a&s;&s;urance is from any con&s;i&s;tency with negligence, much le&s;s does it fo&s;ter it: For it grows only upon adherence to the Lord's
<PB N="101" REF="030532_0100_0FE7C24D53695C40">way, and is &s;trengthened by a &s;ucce&s;sful pur&s;uit of &s;alva|tion in the Lord's way. To intermit or neglect duty, razes the foundation, or at lea&s;t, lays an un&s;urmountable &s;top in the way of its progre&s;s and growth. And fur|ther, it is widely differenced from that una&s;&s;aulted con|fidence &s;ome pretend to, which is a fruit of pride, and fo&s;ters it, as the la&s;t remark clears. In a word, the ca&s;e is plainly thus: This way the Lord di&s;covers, is &s;afe for a &s;elf-condemned &s;inner. I am &s;ate in a practical adher|ence to it. The further I go, and the clo&s;er I in prac|tice cleave to this way, hope of this &s;alvation increa&s;es the more. Here no place for &s;loth, but a &s;pur to dili|gence, as what will not be in vain in the i&s;&s;ue, and is at|tended with the comfort in every &s;tep, as carrying &s;till nearer the de&s;ired &s;alvation. And this &s;afery ari&s;ing from a renunciation of all confidence in the fle&s;h, and a tru&s;t only in the &s;overeign grace of God through Chri&s;t, there is no place for confidence in our&s;elves, or pride in any degree, the lea&s;t degree of pride being a &s;tep out of this way of peace and &s;afety.</P>
<P N="14">14. A &s;ixth di&s;cernible difference, was with re&s;pect to the ordinances of the Lord's appointment, P&s;al. xxvi. 4. This di&s;covery, 1. Drew me to follow them as the Lord's in&s;titutions, and appointed means of obtaining di&s;coveries of his <HI>beauty.</HI> 2. It made me follow after di&s;coveries of the Lord's glory in them, and di&s;coveries from him of my&s;elf, my ca&s;e, my &s;in, my duty. I de&s;ired to behold the <HI>beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple,</HI> ibid. 3. It put me to the Lord to &s;eek the&s;e di&s;coveries from him, and to pray with re&s;pect both to my&s;elf and tho&s;e concerned in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel; <HI>one thing have I de&s;ired of the Lord,</HI> ibid. This was now more con&s;tant; I de&s;ired and <HI>&s;ought after it.</HI> 4. I was brought to more of liveline&s;s, when the Lord di&s;covered him&s;elf; <HI>my &s;oul then followed hard</HI> after him, P&s;al. lxiii. 8. cxix. 32, 65. when his hand upheld me, and when he drew I ran. 5. When the Lord enlarged and cau&s;ed me to approach to him, and &s;ee his glory, he &s;till humbled me, dicovered &s;elf, and put me in oppo&s;ition to it: I have &s;een him, and therefore I loathed my&s;elf, Job xlii. 5, 6.6. I was now acquainted, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, with
<PB N="102" REF="030532_0101_0FE7A15DE8C44F50">that boldne&s;s and freedom of acce&s;s, with humble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on&s;i|dence, to God, as on a throne of grace manife&s;ting him|&s;elf in Chri&s;t. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a word, I was &s;en&s;ible of the Lord's hiding and manife&s;ting him&s;elf in duty, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, and or the nece&s;&s;ity of the exerci&s;e of grace, particularly of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in all approaches to God, and thereby pus upon frequent complaints, dejections for the want of it, cries to C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> for it, and the like.</P>
<P N="15">15. Many other effects followed upon this di&s;covery, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o long to repeat at large. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i. Hereon I found a new and formerly unknown love to all that &s;eemed to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ching of the Lord's image, however different in prin|cip&s;es as to le&s;&s;er things, tempers, &amp;c. and though di&s;tant and unknown, otherwi&s;e than by report. And this evi|dencing it&s;elf in prayer for them, &s;ympathy with them in their afflictions; <HI>which, as all the other, &s;till was more or le&s;s</HI> lively, according as I was otherwi&s;e in wor&s;e or better ca&s;e. I John iii. 14. <HI>By this do we know we are pa&s;&s;ed from death to life, becau&s;e we love the brethren.</HI> A|gain, 2. Hereon I found my care of all the Lord's con|cerns enlarged, and I began to be de&s;irous to have the Lord exalted on the earth, P&s;al. cxii. 6, 7, &amp;c. Zion pro&s;per, and all that love her: I was fearful of hazard that threatened any of his intere&s;ts, affected with the &s;uf|ferings of his people, or any lo&s;s his intere&s;t &s;u&s;tained.

I found it ea&s;y and delight&s;ome to &s;uppre&s;s re&s;entments, and oppo&s;e them, and even to pray for tho&s;e whom I apprehended to have injured the, Luke vi. 27, 28. Yea, with delight I could &s;eek their real good, and pray earne&s;tly for it, P&s;al. xxxv. 13. Other con&s;equences of this di&s;covery will be mentioned hereafter, in their proper places.</P>
<P N="16">16. To conclude this chapter, I found this di&s;covery &s;weetly drawing (P&s;al. cxix. 32. Cant. i. 4.) to a wil|ling, chearful endeavour after holine&s;s in all manner of conver&s;ation. Whereas, all former cour&s;es I took only <HI>drave forcibly</HI> to a <HI>feigned &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion:</HI> Which made me oft

<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. Albeit the effects of this di&s;covery above mentioned were mo&s;t di&s;cernible at fir&s;t, yet I did not then, nor till after that light was gone, di&s;tinctly ob&s;erve them.&mdash; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 1. The glory of the Lord was &s;o great, that for a time I only fixed my eyes upon that, and I was le&s;s in|tent, though much plea&s;ed with it, upon the change that was thereby wrought on me. All this while I was &s;till crying out, <HI>Whence is this to me?</HI> Luke i. 43. And <HI>what am I, and what's my father's bon&s;e,</HI> that the Lord has vi|&s;ited me, and <HI>brought me hitherto?</HI> 2 Sam. vii. 18. Again, 2. I was the le&s;s &s;en&s;ible, or at lea&s;t was the le&s;s di&s;tinct in ob&s;erving the&s;e things, becau&s;e of the remaining darkne&s;s as to the many and great things contained in the cove|nant of grace. This light clearly revealed the my&s;tery of &s;ice ju&s;tification through Chri&s;t, and peace by his bloo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: But I was afterwards to learn other things be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ging to the my&s;tery of redemption: This was what I at pre&s;ent needed, and this the Lord gave abundantly, in &s;o far as the pre&s;ent ca&s;e required it. But yet after this glorious light had &s;taid &s;ome con&s;iderable time with me, I was &s;adly ignorant of many of the mo&s;t important things relating even unto the my&s;tery of forgivene&s;s, the daily u&s;e of this atonement, and the u&s;e &s;pecially of the Lord Chri&s;t with re&s;pect to &s;anctification. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Well might Chri&s;t &s;ay to me many a day after this, as to Philip, John xiv. 9. <HI>Have I been &s;o long time with you, and yet ba&s;t thou not known me, Philip?</HI> What therefore the Lord had done at this time, I <HI>knew not now,</HI> but <HI>here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fter,</HI> John xiii. 7. xvi. 13. when the Comforter had further in&s;tructed me in the nature of the go&s;pel di&s;covery, as I was able to hear it, and as my daily exigencies required it; and when with Peter, being come to my&s;elf, recovered out of the &s;trange &s;urpri&s;e, and put to con&s;ider the thing, then I knew, with him, Acts xii. 11, 12. more di&s;tinctly what con|cerned the Lord's work, and what he had done for me, Acts xviii. 26.</P>
<P N="3">3. This di&s;covery, while it la&s;ted, was full of ravi&s;h|ing &s;weetne&s;s, and many things contributed very much to make it &s;o&mdash;I. The ca&s;e wherein it found me: I was
<PB N="105" REF="030532_0104_0FE7C2568024B288">condemned by God, by my <HI>own con&s;cience,</HI> and was like to &s;ink under the pre&s;&s;ure of the fear of a pre&s;ent execu|tion of the &s;entence: When the u&s;ual labours of the day required that I &s;hould &s;leep, and my body toiled and wa&s;ted with the di&s;quiet of my mind, made me heavy, and urged it more; yet I was afraid to clo&s;e mine eyes, le&s;t I &s;hould awaken in hell, and dur&s;t not let my&s;elf &s;leep, till I was by a weary body beguiled into it, le&s;t I &s;hould drop into the pit before I was aware, Eccl. v. 12. Was it any wonder that the news of pardon and forgivene&s;s were &s;weet to one in &s;uch a ca&s;e? whereby I was made to lie down in &s;afety, and take quiet re&s;t, while there was <HI>none</HI> to <HI>make</HI> me <HI>afraid,</HI> Micah iv. 4. <HI>For &s;o giveth he his beloved &s;leep,</HI> P&s;al. cxxvi. 2. A little before I was like Jonah in the whale's belly, Jonah ii. 5, 6, 7. <HI>The waters compa&s;&s;ed me about even to the &s;oul; the deep clo&s;ed me round about, the weeds were wrapt about my head, I went down to the bottom of the mountains, the earth with her bars was about me for ever.</HI> Ver. 4. <HI>And I &s;aid, I am ca&s;t out of God's &s;ight.</HI> Now, was it any wonder that &s;uch an one was delighted when brought into a garden of delights, placed out of all view of trouble, &s;ave a reflec|tion on it as pa&s;t, which is retre&s;hing, and &s;et down, to &s;un him&s;elf, and dry him&s;elf under the refre&s;hing rays of the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s? 2. The things that the Lord di&s;covered, were in them&s;elves glorious, the glory of the Lord &s;hone about me: I &s;aw &s;uch things as <HI>eye hath not &s;een, be&s;ides thee, O God,</HI> I&s;a. lxiv. 4. <HI>No man hath &s;een God at any time, the only begotten of the Father, he hath declared him,</HI> John i. 18. In a word, what I &s;aw was the <HI>my&s;tery of godline&s;s,</HI> 1 Tim. iii. 26. the <HI>wonders of God's law,</HI> which the angels &s;tooping earne&s;tly <HI>look into,</HI> 1 Pet. i. 12. and that with wonder. 3. They were new things wherewithal I was utterly unacquaint before, and this made them the more affecting, I&s;a, lii. 15. <HI>He &s;hall &s;prin|kle many nations, the kings &s;hall &s;hut their mouths at him: For that which had not beem told them &s;hall they &s;ee, and that which they had not heard &s;hall they confider.</HI> Prov. xxv. 26. <HI>As cold waters to a thir&s;ty &s;oul, &s;o is good news from a far country.</HI> Again, 4. The light wherein the&s;e things were di&s;covered, was a clear &s;parkling light, that
<PB N="106" REF="030532_0105_0FE7A16C64B1B510">had a warming force, and reviving influence, that I was altogether a &s;tranger to before: And one that was a &s;tran|ger to light, at lea&s;t to this <HI>light of the Lord,</HI> could not but with plea&s;ure enjoy it; for truly <HI>light is &s;weet, and a plea&s;ant thing it is for the eyes to behold the &s;un,</HI> Eccl. xi. 7.</P>
<P N="4">4. This di&s;covery and manife&s;tation was of a much lon|ger continuance, and far more bright than any I ever &s;ince got; for it &s;hone in its brightne&s;s for about ten days time, and for long after that, it was not quite off: And while it la&s;ted, many things made it ob&s;ervable&mdash;1. New di&s;coveries were daily made, the Lord carried from one thing to another, and in this &s;hort time taught me more than by all my &s;tudy I had learned before: Yea, he taught me the things I had learned before, in another and quite different manner; what naturally and notional|ly I knew before, in it I corrupted my&s;elf, Jude 10. but now the Lord <HI>in&s;tructed me with a &s;trong hand that I &s;hould not walk in this way;</HI> I&s;a. viii. 11. <HI>and day unto day uttered &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h and might unto night taught knowledge,</HI> P&s;al. xix. 2.; every day I was &s;urpri&s;ed with &s;ome new and before unthought of di&s;covery of the Lord, Iron. iv. 8. This was as <HI>the &s;hining light, &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ming more and more unto the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fect day.</HI> 2. All this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uoe my mind was wholly almo&s;t taken up about &s;piritual things: my <HI>conver&s;ation was in heaven,</HI> Phil. iii. 20. I &s;aw tho&s;e with whom I conver|&s;ed turn every thing (even what was not only innocently, but piou&s;ly &s;aid and meant) into ob&s;cene &s;en&s;es: Where|as now, whatever occuned in reading, in meditation, in conver&s;e, in daily ob&s;ervation, was by mind, and to it, &s;piritualized. I reflected with wonder on this difference, and oft, during this while, was made to look on the mind as a <HI>mould</HI> that ca&s;ts whatever is brought into it into its own &s;hape, Tit. i. 15. <HI>To the pure all things are pure, but to them that are defiled, and unbelieving, is nothing pure; but even their mind and con&s;cience is defiled.</HI> 3. Hereon I was not only joyful, but I found <HI>the joy of the Lord my &s;trength,</HI> Neh. viii. 10. for all this while I was carried out to extra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">inary plea&s;ure and diligence in duty; it was not now, as for ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, a burden to go to duty: But I rejoiced when they &s;aid to me, <HI>Let us go to the hou&s;e of God,</HI> P&s;al. cxxi. 1.

Willingly I engaged in duty; and when I was en|gaged in it, <HI>my &s;oul</HI> oft <HI>made me like the chariots of Ammi|nadib,</HI> Cant. vi. 2. and I was not ea&s;ily &s;topped; and failed &s;ometimes as to the ju&s;t bounds, whereby others, that felt not that ravithing &s;weetne&s;s I enjoyed, were &s;ome|times di&s;ge&s;ted, though &s;ome were not; for &s;o near as I can reckon, it was about this time that the Lord began to commend him&s;elf and his wor&s;hip to lady Anne Elcho, which made her at death ble&s;s the Lord for family wor|&s;hip. 4. The Lord daily in&s;tructed me all this while out of the &s;criptures, and my <HI>heart burned</HI> within me <HI>while be talked</HI> and walked with me <HI>by the way, and opened the &s;criptures,</HI> Luke xxiv. 32. which before were as a &s;ealed book, wherein whatever I read was dark; even that where|of I had &s;ome notion, I was ready to &s;ay of it, <HI>I cannot read it, for it is &s;ealed,</HI> I&s;a. is.

The Lord had many gracious de&s;igns in this, which I was ignorant of then, as what I &s;hall &s;peedily narrate will &s;hew; but the Lord has in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ince taught me, &s;ome of which I &s;hall here narrate&mdash;i.

As to &s;in, there was a great odds; though I could not delight in duty as before, I abhorred thoughts of delighting in &s;in: I was &s;ometimes by the power of temptation driven to con&s;ent, to its embraces, but that was ju&s;t &s;uch a forced con&s;ent, as by the power of conviction I before gave to the law; whenever I was at my&s;elf, I retracted it; <HI>my re|pentings</HI> were <HI>kindled</HI> within me, Ho&s;. xi. 8.

<P N="1">1. I Had not been long in this plea&s;ant ca&s;e before I found my mi&s;take, that enemies were not foiled, and that I mu&s;t down into the valley, and <HI>wre&s;tle with principalities,</HI> and <HI>powers,</HI> Eph. vi. 12. and fight with no le&s;s enemies than the Anakims. My corruptions, &s;elf,

And finding that I was now no more their's, as formerly, they gave me frequent &s;cils: I fell before them often, and multiplied relap&s;es, Rom. vii. 21, x9. <HI>When I would do good, evil was pre&s;ent with me,</HI> and the <HI>good I would do,</HI> through their power, I did not, and <HI>the evil I would not do, that I did.</HI> Thus I learned, that the difference betwixt the Lord's people and others, is not &s;imply in this, that the one falls and the other &s;tands, but that there is a difference in the i&s;&s;ue, Prov. xxiv. 16. <HI>The ju&s;t man falleth &s;even times, but the wicked &s;hall fall into mi&s;chief.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Now though I was unwilling to fight, I drew to ar|mour upon the appearance of the&s;e enemies, who receiv|ed great advantage by that &s;ecurity wherein I had fallen. And before I was aware, they received a great advantage I could not ea&s;ily get from them again. But however, &s;ince fight I mu&s;t, I tried what weapons would be mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, Judges xi. 35. And, 1. I objected to them, that now I had no more to do with them: I had enga|ged with the Lord, I&s;a, xxvi. 13.2. I e&s;&s;ayed to rea|&s;on again&s;t them, as Jo&s;eph did, but without his faith, <HI>Shall I do this great evil, and &s;in again&s;t God?</HI> Gen. xxxix. 9.3. When they &s;till per&s;i&s;ted, I e&s;&s;ayed to flee from them, and avoid the occa&s;ions: But the enemy was in my bo&s;om, Prov. iv. 14, 15.4. I prayed again&s;t them, that the Lord would <HI>rebuke</HI> them, Zech. iii. 2.5. I complained of them as his enemies, Hab. i. 1.6. I prote&s;ted agin&s;t them, Rom. vii. 20. And many other ways did I try.</P>
<P N="3">3. But after all they per&s;i&s;ted, and I was often &s;oiled; and hereon I fell into grievous di&s;couragement. And, 1. I began to doubt if I was &s;incere, or if the Lord was really with me: <HI>If the Lord be us, why is all this evil came upon us?</HI> Judges vi. 13.2. I began to doubt of the i&s;&s;ue, and conclude, I &s;hould <HI>one day peri&s;h</HI> by their <HI>band</HI> 1 Sam. xxvii. 1.3. My con&s;cience being defiled, I was damped, and could not look up to God. And up|on the whole, I was in very great di&s;tre&s;s, oft at giving over, P&s;al. xl. 12.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="114" REF="030532_0113_0FE7A1790CCCDEE8">
4. Though I oft &s;earched at the time, I could not di&s;|cover whence it was that I &s;ailed, P&s;al. lxxvii. 6. For no mean that I thought of then, almo&s;t, I le&s;t une&s;&s;ayed. But &s;ince, &s;everal rea&s;ons of the prevalency of &s;in, and the un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of my attempts again&s;t it, has the Lord graciou&s;ly di&s;covered, though I am far from think|ing to hit them all, or pretending to remember even all that the Lord hath di&s;covered; yet &s;ome of them I &s;hall mea|tion, that now occur: 1. I was in the entry of this war|fare too confident in grace already received, laid too much &s;tre&s;s on it, and promi&s;ed too much on my own hand, like Peter, Matth. xxvi. 33. and so wonder I met with his fate, and was le&s;t to make di&s;coveries of my own weakne&s;s. 2. The &s;ubtile enemies I had to do with, took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e betwixt the &s;traits, and I was not watchful a|gain&s;t, nor aware of the &s;ea&s;ons when they had &s;pecial advantage. The thief knew his time, when the good man is from home, and all is quiet, Matth. xxiv. 43. And I did not watch; and therefore <HI>be came in an hour</HI> when I looked not for him. 3. Mine enemies put me upon vain work, where the &s;in lay, not in the thing it&s;elt, but in the degree of it, there my &s;ubtile enemies put me on to appear again&s;t, and &s;eek to eradicate what was really in it&s;elf lawful. Of this I had many in&s;tances with re|&s;pect to pa&s;&s;ions, and worldly employments, and conver&s;e with &s;inful people: I minded not, that if we were boand altogether up from conver&s;e with the <HI>idolaters, fornicators,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>of this world, we mu&s;t needs go cat of the world,</HI> 1 Cor. v. 10. And as there was an anger to be avoided, &s;o there was an anger that was allowable, and even duty re|quired that we &s;hould be <HI>angry,</HI> Eph. iv. 26. but &s;o as <HI>avoid &s;in,</HI> Eccl. vii. 9. Thus Satan tempted me to pro|voke God, by aiming at things which were neither given of God, nor had I any rea&s;on to expect them, and thus to tempt God, by &s;eeking <HI>&s;tones to be made bread,</HI> Matth. iv. 3. or things not meet to be done: Like the Stoicks, I was not content to have the pa&s;&s;ions kept in their own order, but would have them eradicated. Thus the devil drives to extremes, and when we fail of &s;ucce&s;s, he takes thence occa&s;ion to di&s;courage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. Again, 4. I &s;till neglected &s;ome means of God's appoint|ment,
<PB N="115" REF="030532_0114_0FE7C2696A71A578">under pretence of inconveniences and difficulties, and &s;ometimes becau&s;e irk&s;ome to the fle&s;h; whereas the&s;e were oft-times the only proper means, that were o|mitted, or at lea&s;t the principal in that ca&s;e. The omi&s;|&s;ion of one thing ruins much, and our apologies and ex|ce&s;es will not do, 1 Sam. xiii. 13, 15, 20, 22. Some particular &s;ins require particular remedies: When God has appointed the u&s;e of the&s;e, and this is omitted, no wonder all others fail. When the di&s;ciples a&s;ked, where|fore they could not ca&s;t the devil out? our Lord told them, there were <HI>&s;ome kinds</HI> that went not out <HI>but by fa&s;ting and prayer,</HI> Mark ix. 28.29. Whenever any mean is appointed by God, when the ca&s;e occurs wherein it is requi&s;ite, the remedy of God's appointment mu&s;t be u&s;ed, as we would reach the end. If there are &s;uppo&s;ed or real difficulties, yet while the&s;e difficulties are not our &s;in, we have rea&s;on to tru&s;t him as to the&s;e, and try the means. 5. I was often &s;inthful, and by <HI>dro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ne&s;s a man is cloathed with rags,</HI> Prov. xxiii. 21. <HI>and enemies</HI> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y <HI>ea&s;ily &s;ow ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es when men are a&s;leep,</HI> Matth. xiii. 25.6. Above all, I was little acquaint with the way of &s;aith's improvement of Chri&s;t for &s;anctification, and a trade with the throne of grace for &s;upplies to help in time of need, John v. 40.7. I was &s;ometimes not &s;ingle in my aims; I de&s;igned to have a victory that would ea&s;e me of the trouble of watchfulne&s;s. I was weary of a &s;ighting life, and would have been at ca&s;e, and had too much of an eye unto this, and &s;uch like aims; and, belike, if I got leave to re&s;t. I would have been too proud of my had &s;ucce&s;s: Thus <HI>we a&s;k and receive not, becau&s;e are u&s;e ami&s;s, to con&s;ume is on ear l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ts,</HI> James iv. 3.8. When I was not pre&s;ently heard, I did not per&s;evere in prayer for the &s;upplies of grace that I &s;ought. Luke xviii. 1.

<P N="5">5. Yet notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e dreadful mi&s;carriages on my part, the Lord, in the heat of this conflict, and even while I was many ways faulty, was very kind: 1. He

Thus <HI>fooli&s;h was I and ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ant, I was at a bea&s;t before thee. Neverthele&s;s I am continually with thee: Thou ha&s;t holden me by my right hand. Thou wilt guide are by thy coun&s;el and receive me to glory.</HI> 3. I had gracious experiences of the Lord's help|ing in the time of need, and hearing cries. The Lord &s;ometimes &s;tepped in when I was overcome, and &s;ent as it were an <HI>Abigail,</HI> to keep me from executing my wicked purpo&s;es, 1 Sam. xxv. 32. &s;ometimes be gave me a cleanly victory, and &s;trengthened me to repel temptations: And ma|ny other ways did he help and <HI>deliver,</HI> P&s;al. cvi. 43.4. He &s;ometimes, and even very frequently, when I was hard put to it, cleared up my &s;incerity, and gave me &s;uch views of it, as emboldened me to appeal to him, which freed me from that temptation, and le&s;t me at liberty under the advantage of this new encouragement, to appo&s;e more vigorou&s;ly; P&s;al. cxxxix. 21, 22. <HI>Do not I hate all them that hate thee?

<P N="6">6. The Lord has &s;ince let me &s;ee what gracious de|&s;igns he carried on by this trial, and what need there was of it, in order both to his glory and my good:&mdash; 1.

<PB N="117" REF="030532_0116_0FE7C26B8EB98FD0">that therefore our &s;ecurity with re&s;pect to future tempta|tions, is not in grace already received, but in this, that there is enough in the promi&s;e, and the way patent <HI>to the thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of grace</HI> for it, Heb. iv. 16.3.

He led me hereby to di&s;cern &s;omewhat more of the covenant of grace, that in it there are no promi&s;|es made of ab&s;olute freedom from &s;in while we are here; 1 John i. 8. <HI>If any man &s;ay, he has no &s;in, he is a liar:</HI> And that we have no promi&s;e of freedom from gro&s;s &s;ins, and tho&s;e &s;ins wherein we have been formerly entangled, but in the u&s;e, and diligent u&s;e, of the means of the Lord's appointment. 2 Pet. i. 8. <HI>If the&s;e things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye &s;hall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> 5.

But where there is a di&s;tru&s;t of &s;elf, with an eye to the Lord, it is very far otherwi&s;e. 6. He hereby taught me the u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity, and glory of that pro|vi&s;ion that is made by the covenant of grace for guilt; it writes all to us to di&s;&s;uade from, and enable us again&s;t &s;in; <HI>but if any man &s;in,</HI> through the power of tempta|tion, it lets us &s;ee <HI>an advocate with the Father, and blood that clean&s;eth from all &s;in,</HI> I John iii. 3.7.

<P N="3">3. At &s;ometimes when I &s;ell into &s;uch &s;ins, when &s;elf and pride prevailed, or the like evils I was more deeply engaged again&s;t, obtained any notable advantage, I was, by <HI>the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in,</HI> for a time <HI>hardened.</HI> Heb. iii. 13. and in&s;en&s;ible, like David after his &s;oul fall.

At that time I was attacked with &s;ins that were ea&s;ily known to be &s;ins, my con&s;cience was ea&s;ily convinced of them, and aiar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed with them and thereby was more deeply exerci&s;ed and &s;ought more after distinct di&s;coveries of forgivene&s;s, which were attended with all the&s;e plea&s;ant effects; &s;ince that the Lord in &s;ome mea&s;ure broke the&s;e lu&s;ts, I have been a&s;&s;aulted with le&s;s di&s;cernible evils, &s;ins under the ma&s;k of duties, and the&s;e &s;ecretly devour my &s;trength, and rarely and difficultly are they di&s;covered in their ex|ceeding &s;infulne&s;s, and &s;o when it is much needed, I am more a dranger to that &s;tate of repentance. But as I &s;ee I need it, &s;o the Lord knows I long to be brought into it, and to be humbled, e&s;pecially for &s;ecret and hidden &s;ins that wa&s;ted the &s;trength. Oft have I been made to think of this, that all the excu&s;es mentioned in the para|ble of the &s;upper, that kept them that were invited from clo&s;ing with the offer, were taken from occa&s;ions in them|&s;elves lawful, Matth. xxii. 5. And no doubt, the excu&s;es whereby the Lord's own people are kept from that near|ne&s;s, that it is their duty and intere&s;t to &s;eek after, flow from the &s;ame things: I have found them far the more dangerous and hurtful hindrances.</P>
<P N="12">12. The Lord, by &s;uch exerci&s;es, in&s;tructed me &s;ince, and at the time, in &s;everal u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons&mdash;1. The Lord this way taught me how to walk with him. He dealt
<PB N="126" REF="030532_0125_0FE7C228598DCF20">with me as we are wont to do with children, he held me by the hand, he let me well nigh &s;lip, P&s;al. xciv. 18. and &s;ometimes fall, and this to let me know I was not able to go alone; and then he graciou&s;ly rai&s;ed me up, and comforted me, that I &s;hould not by this be altogether di&s;couraged from walking in his way, Ho&s;. xi. 3, 4. <Q>I taught Ephraim al&s;o to go, taking them by their arms, but they knew not that I healed them; I drew them with the cords of a man, and with bands of love. And I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.</Q> 2. As the Lord, by the prevalency of &s;in, taught the nece&s;&s;ity of an ex|ten&s;ive remedy, &s;o by the experience of forgivene&s;s, in &s;uch ca&s;es as I have mentioned, he taught the certainty of this, that this forgivene&s;s is <HI>really</HI> as exten&s;ive, rich and free, as the ca&s;e requires, P&s;al. xxxii. 5.3. He, by the experience of this, enabled me to under&s;tand better, and &s;peak more feelingly of the&s;e truths, than otherwi&s;e I could have done, and to comfort others with comforts, not only real, but experienced, even &s;uch wherewith I my|&s;elf had been <HI>comforted of God,</HI> 2 Cor. i. 4. Thus what I <HI>have heard</HI> and <HI>&s;een,</HI> and <HI>handled, of the word of life,</HI> that <HI>declared</HI> I to others, 1 John i. 1.4 The Lord gave &s;ome acquaintnance with the nature, exerci&s;e, and effects of the mo&s;t u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary graces of his Spirit, fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, repentance, &amp;c. And finally, The Lord beat down &s;elf very much by this exerci&s;e. Of this de&s;ign the Lord, of late, while I read in my family in the 9th chapter of Denteronomy, gave me a plea&s;ant view, which I &s;hall re|pre&s;ent in the following remarks from that chapter.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. God's great de&s;ign upon I&s;rael, is to manife&s;t the glory of his grace, mercy, patience, and faithfulne&s;s, in their &s;alvation, their deliverance from Egypt, and put|ting them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canaan, &s;ee ver. 5, 6.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Naturally &s;inners, as all his people are &s;uch, are, and appear very oppo&s;ite to this de&s;ign, being deeply &s;el|fi&s;h, as the whole of this chapter, and the &s;criptures ma|nife&s;t. And this &s;elf has two branches, which are like its two eyes, <HI>&s;elf &s;trength,</HI> and <HI>&s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> ver. 1, 2. and ver. 5.6.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Self in the&s;e two branches is very &s;trong. We are
<PB N="127" REF="030532_0126_0FE7C27EB8ED3248">ready to pretend, that our own &s;trength carried us through difficulties, when once we have overcome them, which we were &s;o far from being able of our&s;elves to grapple with, that the very thoughts of them frighted us, com|pare ver. 1, 2. of this chapter, with the 13th and 14th chapters of Numbers. And we are ready to a&s;cribe to our own righteou&s;ne&s;s what we get, when we, meanwhile, are not worthy of the lea&s;t of all God's mercies, ver. 5, 6, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Yet how &s;trong &s;oever the&s;e are, they mu&s;t be &s;ub|dued. In order thereto, the Lord, after he begins to ma|nife&s;t him&s;elf to his people, leads them not pre&s;ently into Canaan; but carries them through the wilderne&s;s, where a variety of temptations draw out di&s;coveries of their &s;e|cret corruptions, their weakne&s;s and wickedne&s;s, &s;ee ver. 6, 7.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The di&s;coveries of God's patience, mercy and grace, and of his people's weakne&s;s and wickedne&s;s, e&s;pecially after remarkable manife&s;tations of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Lord, are means which the Lord makes u&s;e of, and remarkably blefies, to cure them of the&s;e di&s;tempers, and put out the&s;e two eyes of the wicked idol: Con&s;ider the whole chapter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The Lord, for this end, whenever he is about to complete, or carry on the begun deliverance and mercy, revives the impre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e things. Read the whole chapter, particularly ver. 7.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Many other gracious de&s;igns did the Lord in this way carry on, he let me &s;ee the bitterne&s;s of &s;in, and di&s;co|vered it to be exceeding &s;inful; he let me &s;ee much of the helli&s;h ingratitude of my heart, he let me &s;ee the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of coming daily to the throne of grace, as for grace to help in time of need, &s;o for mercy and forgivene&s;s. He made me &s;ee with wonder, how one view of forgive|ne&s;s and pardoning mercy alienates the &s;oul more from &s;in, than twenty &s;ights, nay ta&s;tes of hell, (which Pela|gians cannot under&s;tand): And many other things.</P>
<P N="13">13. Be&s;ides the&s;e more gro&s;s evils I fell into, through the violence of temptation, I was exerci&s;ed about the guilt of &s;ins of daily incur&s;ion and infirmity, deadne&s;s, wan|dering in duty, and innumerable others. When I began to be fir&s;t exerci&s;ed about forgivene&s;s, I was much diffi|culted
<PB N="128" REF="030532_0127_0FE7C22E49E8E550">about the&s;e; and I &s;hall, in the following particu|lars, repre&s;ent my exerci&s;e about them: 1. When the Lord manife&s;ted him&s;elf, his enemies fled before him, P&s;al. lxviii. 1. and received a &s;tunning &s;troke, as has been &s;hewed. 2. It was &s;ometime before any of the &s;tronger enemies di&s;covered them&s;elves again, pre&s;umptu|ous &s;ins for a time, as has been repre&s;ented, kept quiet. The fir&s;t di&s;coveries of the remaining power of indwel|ling &s;in which I got, was in the inva&s;ions of &s;in of daily infirmity: 'For in many things we offend all,' James iii. 2.3. Hereon I began to be much di&s;couraged, nei|ther under&s;tanding well our &s;tate here, that if any man &s;ay, He has <HI>no &s;in,</HI> he <HI>deceives him&s;elf,</HI> 1 John i. 8. and the gracious provi&s;ion made for this ca&s;e in the covenant of grace, the daily &s;acrifice, that is, the daily application to the throne of grace, the blood of atonement, the fountain opened, P&s;al. xxx. 6. And &s;o being under a fond and groundle&s;s expectation of entire freedom from &s;in. 4. My fooli&s;h expectation being quickly di&s;appoint|ed by the outbreaking of the&s;e &s;ins, I wi&s;t not what to do: I thought it hard to trouble him who had been &s;o kind, to &s;eek new favours, lia. vii. 13. The pride of my heart could not &s;toop to be continually, daily, hour|ly beholden for new favours: I would have been a <HI>lord,</HI> and <HI>come no more to</HI> Chri&s;t, Jer. ii. 31. This pride was &s;o ma&s;ked up, that at that time I did not di&s;cern it; but &s;ince the Lord has made it manife&s;t. 5. But nece&s;&s;ity has no law: they grew many; <Q>For who can under&s;tand his errors?</Q> P&s;al. xix. 12. and the light of the Lord daily di&s;covered more and more of them. 6. Hereon I e&s;&s;ay|ed to humble my&s;elf di&s;tinctly for every one of them, and to make a di&s;tinct application to the throne of grace about each; but when I began to ob&s;erve them, they were &s;o many, that if I had followed this cour&s;e, my whole time would not have &s;ufficed: Hereon the Lord led me to that cour&s;e, which a worthy friend, to whom I owe much for a di&s;tinct under&s;tanding of the Lord's work with me, told me what Franci&s;cus De Sales, a popi&s;h ca&s;ui&s;t, ad|vi&s;es to in this ca&s;e&mdash;I was fain to take them all in the ump, or rather to go with them all on me at once, and plunge my&s;elf into the fountain that is opened for &s;in and
<PB N="129" REF="030532_0128_0FE7C280E9CFACA0">for uncleanne&s;s, that is, I took a view of my&s;elf as defiled by innumerable evils of this &s;ort, and under a &s;en&s;e of them, ca&s;t my&s;elf upon the glorious atonement, and en|deavoured to lay &s;tre&s;s for clean&s;ing as to them all, whe|ther &s;uch as I ci&s;cerned di&s;tinctly, or &s;uch as I had not yet di&s;covered, on that blood that <HI>clean&s;eth from all &s;in;</HI> which I think was the P&s;almi&s;t's way under the like ca&s;e, P&s;al. xix. 12, 13. <Q>Who can under&s;tand his errors? clean&s;e thou me from &s;ecret faults. Keep back thy &s;ervant al&s;o from pre&s;umptuous &s;ins, let them not have domi|nion over me. Then &s;hall I be upright, and I &s;hall be innocent from the great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</Q> That Popi&s;h ca&s;ui&s;t before mentioned, as my worthy friend told me, illu&s;trates this by a very elegant &s;imilitude, <Q>If a man &s;ee one or two filthy creatures on him he &s;hakes or wa&s;hes them off: But if he look and &s;ee him|&s;elf all over&s;pread with &s;uch, then he mu&s;t bethink him&s;elf of &s;ome general cour&s;e, he goes to &s;ome bridge, and leaps into a deep pool, and drowns them all, and leaves them behind him.</Q> If any one gro&s;&s;er &s;in o|vertake us, we mu&s;t endeavour a di&s;tinct recovery and intimation of pardon by a di&s;tinct application to the blood of &s;prinkling: But when we look upon the&s;e &s;ins which cannot be numbered and &s;earched out, and which are &s;till growing, then we mu&s;t betake our&s;elves with the man to the bridge, and leap into the pool. 7. To clear this mat|ter yet further, I ob&s;erve, that the light wherein that plenteous redempton that is with God, was fir&s;t di&s;cover|ed, though variou&s;ly clouded and darkened, yet continu|ed in &s;ome mea&s;ure: A child of light continues <HI>light in the Lord;</HI> he may <HI>walk in darkne&s;s,</HI> and to his &s;en&s;e <HI>have no light,</HI> Eph. v. 8. I&s;a. l. 10. while yet it is the remain|der of light that makes him di&s;cern his darkne&s;s, but he really is not darkne&s;s as before: He has his &s;ummer's &s;un, that &s;hines longer, brighter, and warmer; and his win|ter's &s;un, that &s;hines &s;horter, is more frequently clouded, and has le&s;s heat: He has his fair days and foul and rainy days, and a changeable intercour&s;e of day and night, wherein he has only the moon and &s;tars; but light more or le&s;s there is &s;till. 8. When no extraordinary indi&s;po|&s;ition, no extraordinary darkne&s;s was on me, this habitu|al
<PB N="130" REF="030532_0129_0FE7C22FD72B9C30">di&s;covery of forgivene&s;s, and the way to it, had its own u&s;e. The winter's &s;un was not able to revive when I was ca&s;t into any of tho&s;e di&s;tempers above-mentioned; and therefore, as has been above-narrared, in that ca&s;e, I waited a blink of the &s;en in its &s;trength; but for or|dinary, I by the direction of that light did endeavour daily, as to fins of infirmity, to betake my&s;elf in prayer to the blood of atonement, according as the Lord has taught us by the daily morning and evening &s;acrifice un|der the law: As for particular ca&s;es and pollutions, there were other in&s;titutions with re&s;pect to them. 9. This ap|plication by prayer to <HI>the redemption that is in Chri&s;t,</HI> even <HI>the forgivene&s;s of &s;in through &s;aith in his blood,</HI> Rom. iii. 25. according to this di&s;covery of it, in and by prayer, e&s;pecially when the Lord quickened by any new blink; (for the winter &s;un has his warm and refre&s;hing blinks, even in the colde&s;t &s;ea&s;on): this application, I &s;ay, e&s;pe|cially when the Lord, as he frequently did, gave any new breathing, did relieve me, and help to quiet my con&s;cience as to the afflicting &s;en&s;e of the&s;e &s;ins of daily incur&s;ion: When the helped to pray for clean&s;ing from <HI>&s;ecret &s;ins,</HI> and keep back <HI>from pre&s;umptuous &s;ins,</HI> P&s;al. xix. 12.13. I was &s;atisfied as to my uprightne&s;s and freedom from <HI>the great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and acceptance with him in following any duty of my &s;tation, <HI>through the beloved.</HI> 10. As the ca&s;e was not &s;o urgent, &s;o neither was the outgate &s;o di&s;|cernible: but it was &s;ufficient to an&s;wer in &s;ome mea&s;ure the end above-mentioned, freedom from di&s;piriting di&s;|couragement, and &s;ome mea&s;ure of comfort and quiet as to my acceptance with God through Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I conclude with four ob&s;ervations as to the whole: 1. Though we may &s;ometimes <HI>heal</HI> our own wound <HI>&s;light|ly,</HI> yet it is God's prerogative to &s;peak &s;olid <HI>peace,</HI> I&s;a lvii. 19. yea, and the &s;peaking of it is a work of the greate&s;t power, where the con&s;cience is really exerci&s;ed; it is a <HI>creating peace,</HI> and where he creates it, he can make it take effect, Job xxiv. 29. <HI>When he giveth quietne&s;s, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Whether it be done again&s;t a nation or again&s;t a man only.</HI> 2. The Lord let me &s;ee, that con|&s;idering the pride and unbelief of our hearts, and the
<PB N="131" REF="030532_0130_0FE7C28856FFE4C8">greatne&s;s of our guilt, it is not ea&s;y to win to believe that the forgivene&s;s that is with God is able to an&s;wer all we need, and &s;o to engage a &s;inner to betake him&s;elf unto it at all times, when once he comes to &s;ee his ca&s;e throughly; and when his unbelief is in &s;ome mea&s;ure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;|tered, and the &s;oul &s;atisfied of the fulne&s;s of the fountain, and exten&s;ive, nay, infinite reach of the forgivene&s;s that is with God, and the pride of heart &s;o far broken, that the &s;oul is willing to be daily beholden to grace and mer|cy, it is not ea&s;y to keep up either a due dete&s;tation of &s;in, or keep our carnal hearts from a common u&s;e of it, or rather an abu&s;e of it: Here, in my opinion, lies one of the greate&s;t &s;ecrets of practical godline&s;s, and the highe&s;t attainment in clo&s;e walking with God; to come daily and wa&s;h, and yet to keep as great a value for this di&s;co|very of forgivene&s;s, as if it were once only to be got and no more: Indeed the more we &s;ee of it, the more we &s;hould value it; but our carnal hearts, on the contrary, tern formal, and count it a <HI>common thing.</HI> That which is out daily allowance we value little, and we are fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of novelties and dainties: Bread is more precious than mo&s;t, nay, any of the rarities which men purcha&s;e at &s;o dear a rate; but becau&s;e God has provided i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in plenty, and we daily u&s;e it, therefore we make a light account of it: Ble&s;&s;ed are they with whom it is otherwi&s;e in the ca&s;e now in hand. 3. I ob&s;erve, that the joy of the Lord is then only to be retained when we walk tenderly and cir|cum&s;pectly; it is incon&s;i&s;tent not only with the enter|tainment of any gro&s;s &s;in, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with a carele&s;s walk: <HI>Then had the churches re&s;t throughout all Judea, and G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ce, and Sanaria, and were edified, walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. Acts IX. 32.4. I ob&s;erve, then when I was as the lowe&s;t ebo, as to forgivene&s;s, doubting if the Lord would pardon, after many duties have been e&s;&s;ayed without finding the Lord, or any &s;en&s;e of his love, I have oft found him in the du|ty of thankfulne&s;s: And whereas one will &s;ay, What had I then to be thankful for? I an&s;wer, I began thus, What a mercy is it that I am out of hell? Lam. iii. 21, 22. <HI>It is of the Lord's mercies</HI> I am <HI>not con&s;umed;</HI> ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for this. Again, What a mercy is it, that not on|ly
<PB N="132" REF="030532_0131_0FE7C2359F9FE2E0">the Lord has helped me to notice his mercy in keep|ing me out of hell, but to be thankful for it?

Then &s;hall the earth yield her increa&s;e, and God, then our own God &s;hall ble&s;s us.</HI></P>
<P>Upon a further ob&s;ervation of this variety of ca&s;es wherewith I was exerci&s;ed, the Lord's management of them, and what I have felt in my&s;elf, I &s;ee, be&s;ides the fruits before-mentioned, many others. 1. The Lord hereby rebuked me for my fondne&s;s of enlargement, and my thinking to live a life of &s;en&s;e, and trained me &s;ome|what up to a life of faith, the faith of adherence, that cleaves to God as revealed in the word, and refu&s;es to quit the word even when it finds not the Lord in it, in a &s;en&s;ible way that refre&s;hes, which certainly is more &s;trong than that which cleaves to it when it feels &s;en&s;ible refre&s;hment and power: to tru&s;t in God when hiding and threatening to <HI>&s;tay,</HI> Job xiii. 15. is to <HI>hope again&s;t hope.</HI> 2.

<P N="1">1. I Have before mentioned, and given &s;ome account of my trials about the being of God. Being now to give an account of the relief, it will be proper to re|capitulate briefly my whole exerci&s;e with re&s;pect unto this head, and &s;et the temptation and the relief together.</P>
<P N="2">2. I have &s;hewed above, that I was early, even as &s;oon almo&s;t as I began to have any clo&s;e concern about reli|gion,

But at fir&s;t I had no arguments urged again&s;t this truth, or injected into my mind. On|ly being made to &s;ee, that this was the hinge whereon the whole of religion turns, all hopes depend, and by which all practices were to be regulate, I found my&s;elf at a lo&s;s for want of an evidence, &s;ufficiently clear and &s;trong, and convincing, which I thought nece&s;&s;ary, with re&s;pect to a truth whereon &s;o much weight was to be laid.

<P N="3">3.

<P N="4">4. Hereon a &s;harp conflict began to be managed in my brea&s;t.

But his in&s;tances were &s;o many, and &s;o &s;ubtile, that I could not prevail this way; but the longer I &s;tood arguing the ca&s;e, I was put in the greater lo&s;s, Rev. xii. 9.

In this ca&s;e, I &s;ometimes hoped that he would ari&s;e, and then mine enemies would be made to flee before him: Though the truth is, I could but give little rea&s;on for it. 6.

7. But yet I was not fully relieved. Nothing but a di&s;covery of God could give a full defeat to Satan, Zech. iii. 2, Wherefore the Lord at length pitied me; not in the way that I could have de&s;ired; for I would have had it then.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Containing an account how I came to be &s;atisfied that the &s;criptures are the word of God, and how temptations in reference to them were repelled.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. TO give a clear account of the i&s;&s;ue of my tempta|tion, it will be nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hortly recapitu|late what formerly has been &s;poken concerning the trial, and my carriage under is.</P>
<P N="2">2. This tempation did not attack me &s;o early as the former, but it was managed much in the &s;ame way; &s;ome|times my mind only hung in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and hovered in un|certainty, for want of evidence proportioned to the im|portance of the truth for my faith to fix on: At other times, I was &s;trangely hara&s;&s;ed with violent temptations, multiplied and &s;ubtile objections which were thronged daily in on my mind, by reading books full of them, by conver&s;e with enemies to the word, by Satan's &s;ugge&s;|tions, which were by much the more &s;ubtile and trou|ble&s;ome to me.</P>
<P N="3">3. This exerci&s;e was in &s;ome mea&s;ure more perplexing than the former, becau&s;e it was no le&s;s ruining to all &s;a|tisfying religion; the objections were much more plau&s;i|ble, they were far more in number, and entertained by per&s;ons of a better character, and the evidence of the truth lay farther from the reach of an unenlightened mind.</P>
<P N="4">4. Before the i&s;&s;ue came, the Lord gave, by con&s;ider|ations formerly mentioned, &s;ometimes a merciful check unto temptations, and kept them from overwhelming me quite; of which I have formerly given &s;ome account.</P>
<P N="5">5. I tried many ways be&s;ides prayer and attendance upon ordinances; I bought, borrowed, and read many books, written in defence of them, which wanted not its own &s;olid u&s;e; for hereby I got a deep rational convic|tion of the truth, and &s;o was emboldened to plead for them again&s;t enemies, and oft times to beat them at their
<PB N="140" REF="030532_0139_0FE7C243CA1BA968">own weapons: and I got many particular objections fully an&s;wered, and was hereby encouraged to wait for full &s;a|tisfaction, without de&s;pairing. E&s;pecially one book had this u&s;e; after I had, without the &s;atisfaction I de&s;ired, though nor without the fruits above-mentioned, peru&s;ed my later writings, the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d me to look into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> filling of the Scriptures, which had lien by me negrected: And I found this more convincing than any I had read, becau&s;e it brought me nearer the proper evidence where|on faith &s;hould fix, than any of the re&s;t; it di&s;covered more of the intrin&s;iek worth of the word than the others, and pleaded &s;trongly in point of rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="6">6. Yet after all this, my mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mained un&s;atisfied, none of the&s;e arguments had acthority to repel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">atiens, being but the wi&s;dom of man; nor, on the &s;ame account, did they lay a four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation for divine faith, nor did they enlighten a darkened mind to &s;ee the evidence of God in the word; nor were they able to rectity an indi&s;po&s;ed pallate, and convey a ta&s;te and &s;avour of the word of God to the &s;oul, that was able to &s;atisfy me that it was &s;uch bread as a <HI>man</HI> might <HI>love by,</HI> Matth. iv. 4.</P>
<P N="7">7. Thus it continued with me un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">il the Lord came, and let in the fore-mentioned di&s;covery of his glory into my &s;oul, and hereby I was relieved and &s;atisfied as to this doubt al&s;o, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Cor. xiv. 24.25. The Lord had before, when I was under the convincing work of his Spirit, af|fected my con&s;cience with &s;ome &s;en&s;e of his authority in the word, evidencing it&s;elf by that convincing and con|demning light and power which I di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cerned and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eit; and hereby the force of the foregoing temptation was u&s;ually broke in &s;ome mea&s;ure, when the Lord by the word and fa&s;ten on my &s;oul a &s;en&s;e of my guilt, but this di&s;covery of &s;in by the word being terrible to me, rather extorted an a&s;&s;ent, than induced to a willing con&s;ent and cheerful acquie&s;cence in the word as coming from God.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Containing a &s;hort account of the i&s;&s;ue of &s;ome other temptations wherewith I had been exerci&s;ed, and the relief I got with re&s;pect to them, from the Lord.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I Have above &s;hewed, that Satan, who had oft temp|ted me to pride, when he found it for his intere&s;t, turned him&s;elf another way, and made it his work to drive to a ba&s;tard &s;ort of humility. When I was caught in the thicket of his temptations about the truth of the &s;criptures, and other things of an alike nature, and was u&s;ing means to get my mind relieved; he oft, with much importunity, urged me with this thought, <HI>"To what pur|po&s;e do ye &s;eek for &s;atisfaction, or how can ye be &s;o vain, as to expect it about the&s;e things, wherein men of incomparably greater reach, abilities, diligence and opportunities, have been obliged to remain un&s;atisfied, and upon that account, have given up with them?"</HI> This temptation was often
<PB N="146" REF="030532_0145_0FE7C2AF24AE9830">urged with that hell'&s;h violence, that I had no &s;pirit left in me by it: I was ready to let my hands hang down, my knees turned feeble, and my mouth was oft at &s;peak|ing it out, that there was <HI>no hope,</HI> and I went about to make my&s;elf de&s;pair of any good, <HI>fruit</HI> of any <HI>labour</HI> ta|ken, or that could by me be exerci&s;ed, and laid out under <HI>the &s;un.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. When the Lord made the foregoing di&s;covery of him&s;elf to me, the force of this temptation was quite broke, by &s;eeing the truths of God in his own light. But I got not a particular di&s;covery of the weakne&s;s of this temptation then, till &s;ome time after reading in my ordi|nary, the three fir&s;t-chapters of the Fir&s;t to the Corinthi|ans, the Lord was plea&s;ed to open mine eyes, and make me under&s;tand the weakne&s;s of this temptation. The light that then &s;hined upon my &s;oul from, and by this portion of &s;cripture, and the &s;atisfaction of &s;oul it gave, as to this temptation, no words can expre&s;s: Nor can I, at this di&s;tance of time, narrate all that then the Lord made convincingly clear to me from his word. Yet the &s;ub&s;tance I do remember, and &s;hall repre&s;ent in the fol|lowing remarks.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> God here repre&s;ented to me, that his great de&s;ign in the method of &s;alvation made choice of by in|finite wi&s;dom, was to &s;tain the pride of all glory; that <HI>no fle&s;h might glory in his &s;ight.</HI> But that <HI>he that glories</HI> &s;hould <HI>glory</HI> only <HI>in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Lord di&s;covered, that a vain ambi|tion to be wi&s;e above what God allowed, was the &s;pring and principal part of our apo&s;tacy from God; and that ever &s;ince Satan fir&s;t dropt that poi&s;on into our natures, it has wrought &s;trongly: <HI>Vain man would be wi&s;e. The Jews a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a &s;ign, and the Greeks &s;eek after wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That in order to the attainment of the fore|going de&s;ign, and indeed for the recovery of man, it was plainly nece&s;&s;ary, that man's ambition in this matter &s;hould be effectually checked. This being a principal branch of our corruption, if it were not cured we were not completely recovered. This lying in a plain oppo&s;i|tion to the de&s;ign of God, if it were not levelled, this de&s;ign could not be reached. Hereon it became nece&s;|&s;ary,
<PB N="147" REF="030532_0146_0FE7C2A632B63938">that God &s;hould <HI>de&s;troy the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e, and bring to nothing the under&s;tanding of the prudent.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> God, to vindicate his own wi&s;dom, which was reproached by this vain ambition of man, to fix an external blot on this wi&s;dom of man, &s;et up in oppo&s;ition to it, and effectually di&s;cover its vanity in the depth of his wi&s;dom, and holy &s;everity in puni&s;hing this ambition, and other wickedne&s;&s;es of vain man, <HI>&s;uffered</HI> for many ages <HI>all nations to walk in their own ways,</HI> and try them, whether they were better than God's way, whether they could &s;upply the defects which they fondly imagined God at fir&s;t had made them with, or relieve them&s;elves from the mi&s;ery their apo&s;tacy had brought them under. <HI>He &s;aid, I will hide my face from them, I will &s;ee what their end &s;hall be: For they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith:</HI> And the event was every way an&s;werable to the expectation and de&s;ign of divine wi&s;|dom and ju&s;tice, and the de&s;ert of the wickedne&s;s and folly of men, who made the attempt; for after near four thou&s;and years fruitle&s;s endeavours &s;pent through the wi&s;e forbearance of God, <HI>The world by wi&s;dom knew not God.</HI> They in the wi&s;dom of God, quite mi&s;&s;ed the mark; <HI>their fooli&s;h minds were darkened; &s;eeking to be wi&s;e, they became fools;</HI> and in&s;tead of getting their eyes opened to &s;ee and know more than God allowed them, they could &s;ee nothing but their' own nakedne&s;s; and &s;o imperfect were their di&s;coveries, that their wi&s;dom &s;ugge&s;ted to them, that fig leaves would cure that.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Fifthly,</HI> After in the wi&s;dom of God, <HI>the world by wi&s;dom knew not God,</HI> after they had &s;pent the time allot|ted them, for trial and di&s;covery of the vanity of their own wi&s;dom, with a &s;ucce&s;s an&s;werable to the vanity of the attempt, God, in the depth of his compa&s;&s;ion, &s;tep|ped in for the relief of mankind; and for a furtherance of the glorious de&s;ign above-mentioned, was plea&s;ed to pitch on a way quite oppo&s;ite to all that the wi&s;dom of fooli&s;h man aimed at. The means he made u&s;e of, were not &s;uch as man's wi&s;dom would or could expect, pre&s;cribe, or approre of. He made not choice of the <HI>enticing words of man's wi&s;dom,</HI> or eloquence, human eloquence. It was no way &s;uitable to the maje&s;ty, truth and uncerity of God,
<PB N="148" REF="030532_0147_0FE7C29F2CC1A440">to make choice of that mean art, whereby the affections of weak men are inveigled, and their judgments are bi|affed, and led blind fold in a &s;ubjection to the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions, which they could govern. He made no choice of arrificial rea&s;onings, the other eye of human wi&s;dom. It did not become the maje&s;ty of God to di&s;pute men into their duty, or a compliance with his will. And albeit he wrought &s;igns to awaken the attention of a world drowned in &s;ecurity, to conciliate re&s;pect to his amba&s;&s;a|dors, to &s;trengthen the faith of his own, and cut off all &s;eemingly rational pleas for unbelief; yet he choo&s;ed not them, nor did he principally in&s;i&s;t on them as the means of converting and recovering the world, not being willing to derogate &s;o far from his word, as to encourage an opi|nion, that the devil would, and has frowardly propaga|ted, that God's word is not upon its own evidence, with|out miracles worthy of the acceptation of rational crea|tures. Nor would he gratify the unbelieving curio&s;ity of men, who would put God to the drudgery of altering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cour&s;e of nature, and plea&s;e their humour at every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Sixthly,</HI> God having rejected all the&s;e, made choice of the fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching, that is, a plain declara|tion of his mind and will in his name, in the <HI>demon&s;tration of the Spirit and power,</HI> and <HI>not in the enticing words of man's wi&s;dom,</HI> by per&s;ons commi&s;&s;ioned for that effect by him. After that in <HI>the wi&s;dom of God, the world by wi&s;|dom knew not God, it plen&s;ed God by the fooli&s;hne&s;s of preach|ing to &s;ave them that believe.</HI> Now this was every way worthy of God. Man was injurious to God, by credit|ing the devil rather than God. The devil &s;eemed to have gained a con&s;iderable advantage, in per&s;uading man in his integrity to credit him, and to di&s;credit God. God on the other hand rubbed &s;hame on him, by engaging fallen man to reject the devil, and credit him on his bare word; and upon this, to give up with Satan, and all that adher|ed to him.</P>

<HEAD>PART IV. <HI>Containing &s;ome account of his ordination unto the holy mini&s;try, and his conduct therein.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of his being licen&s;ed to preach the go&s;pel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN I was under the violent &s;trugglings rela|ted in the account of the &s;econd part of my life, I had daid by all thoughts of the work of the mini&s;|try. It was like hell once, to entertain a thought of preaching to others what I did not believe my&s;elf: But now things began to alter, and the Lord led me on to that which I declined before: And I find the &s;teps of his providence about me in this matter, do de&s;erve to be re|membered by me. 1. My mother did devote me from my childhood to this work, and oft expre&s;&s;ed her de&s;ire to <HI>lend me to the Lord</HI> all the days of my life, to &s;erve him in the <HI>go&s;pel of his Son:</HI> This has oft had its own weight on my &s;pirit. 2. The cour&s;e of my &s;tudies had looked that way; my education pointed towards that work; which providential determination of my &s;tudies, though I had no greatregard to it at &s;ometimes, yet on other occa&s;ions it had &s;ome weight on my &s;pirit, that I dor&s;t not ra&s;hly turn my thoughts another way. 3. The Lord forcibly, by his providence, did break my de&s;ign of fol|lowing the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, by the foregoing exer|ci&s;e, of which I have given an account, brought my mind to acquie&s;ce in this di&s;pen&s;ation, and made philo&s;ophy comparatively di&s;ta&s;teful, and it was upon the &s;erious re|view of the temptations moving me to incline that way, made extremely un&s;avory. 4. The Lord having thus loo&s;ed my heart from that &s;tudy, that for a while did ri|val
<PB N="156" REF="030532_0155_0FE7C2BC5E1A3CE0">it with the &s;tudy of divinity; he did al&s;o, by the foregoing i&s;&s;ue of my dark exerci&s;e, remove and take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> way the principal &s;tumbling blocks, and make the way &s;traight. 5. He further, by the di&s;covery of his glory in the face of Chri&s;t, engaged my heart to, and endeared to my &s;oul the knowledge of Chri&s;t, and him crucified. 5. He brought me under a lively &s;en&s;e of that forcible tie that was hereon laid on me, to lay out my&s;elf in any way that he &s;hould call me to be &s;erviceable to him, and I was made to think, that I &s;hould be the more happy, the more directly my work &s;hould look that way. 7. While, like Peter, I was mu&s;ing &s;ometimes on the&s;e things, about the month of April or May, 1698, two mini&s;ters were &s;ent, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, from the pre&s;|bytery of Kirkaldie, urging me to enter on trials: I did altogether decline the propo&s;al, becau&s;e I had no reading, wanted the languages and had been much di|verted from the &s;tudy, particularly by the foregoing ex|erci&s;e, which had filled my thoughts for near a year and a half, and it was not then two years &s;ince I came from the college. In a word, I did an&s;wer, <HI>I am child, and cannot &s;peak,</HI> Jer. i. 6. And here I &s;tuck, &s;urpri&s;ed and to&s;&s;ed with thoughts what this might mean, and whence it was, for I had &s;carce ever looked near the pre&s;bytery. They pre&s;cribed John i. 12. for a text, and left me to con&s;ider of it. 8. I found my aver&s;ion &s;trong to enter &s;o &s;oon at lea&s;t on trials; but &s;till it had &s;ome weight on my &s;pirit, and I did think further of it, and found that the Lord's dealing with me of late, in the great variety of trials, ca&s;ting me down, and rai&s;ing me up again and again, looked as a preparation for <HI>comforting others with the con&s;olations wherewith I had been comforted,</HI> and &s;ym|pathizing with them, as having had experience of a great variety of tempations, and I found that by the&s;e my lit|tle knowledge of the my&s;tery of the go&s;pel received &s;ome improvement. The mini&s;ters continued to &s;olicit me, and and pre&s;s home their de&s;ire; but while I &s;tood out again&s;t their &s;olicitations, though not without &s;ome &s;ecret &s;trug|gle and doubting, whether in &s;o doing I might not be declining duty, I began to ob&s;erve the Lord rai&s;ing a &s;torm again&s;t me: I began to &s;ee the &s;nares of the &s;ta|tion

About this I much to&s;&s;ed, May 20, 1698. The Lord was taking away &s;ome that had been mo&s;t helpful and en|couraging, my inward perplexities grew, and I was not like to have peace in my own mind. 10. While I was in this ca&s;e, Mr. Riddel did, May 30, come to the Wemy&s;s, and after much conver&s;e, and many rea&s;onings, charged me to try, and have my thoughts on my text, and then do, or &s;tand off, as the Lord &s;hould clear duty, which I did con&s;ent to. 11. But after this I &s;till did &s;hift and decline, and could not think of a compliance; and then December 28, provo&s;t Ram&s;ay wrote, carne&s;tly de&s;iring me to take the charge of my lord Maitland. This put me to a &s;tand a little, and I was inclined to em|brace it at fir&s;t: But on farther con&s;ideration I was fully cleared to reject that motion, and &s;o I remained in my former &s;trait, crying to the Lord frequently, that he might di&s;cover duty. I was fully &s;atisfied that I beho|ved not to &s;tay there, but yet was aver&s;e from the mi|ni&s;try, at lea&s;t &s;o &s;oon. But that which had well nigh turned me quite off, was an expre&s;s from my friend and my father's, the worthy Mr. James Duncan, urging me, in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms, to take the charge of my lord Duplin's children, offering what encouragement I phea&s;ed. My father's deep obligation to that family, and &s;everal other things, carried my inclination toward a compliance: But having at Mr. Forre&s;ter's earne&s;t de&s;ire, undertaken a homily in the new college, which I was to deliver next week, I took time to con&s;ider of it; and after that I had, on February 28, 1699, delivered my di&s;cour&s;e on Job xxviii. 28. I went to vi&s;it my acquaintance, worthy Mr. Shields, who did urge me to enter on trials, with that gravity and concern, that had more weight on my &s;pirit, than all that had been &s;poken to me.

<P>AFTER he was licen&s;ed to preach, and before he was ordained to the mini&s;try, on &s;ome &s;olemn occa&s;ions, he dedicated him&s;elf to the &s;ervice of the Lord, with earne&s;t player for the &s;uitable endowments whereby be might be fitted for the di&s;carge of that high tru&s;t, i&s; it &s;hould plea&s;e God to call him to it.

<P>April 18, 1700 being the fa&s;t in order to Lefly's &s;a|crament, I ro&s;e early in the morning; and after &s;ome re|view of my former ways, and &s;erious thought&s;ulne&s;s of the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent duty, I did in prayer pour out my &s;oul to God, confe&s;&s;ing fins; and I dare not &s;ay, but it was with &s;ome tender &s;en&s;e of the di&s;honour done to God, and of the wretched unkindne&s;s that is in them to God. Original &s;in, imputed and inherent, were both hea|vy and my par icular evils. I did &s;olemnly revew my engagements to the Lord, accepting of Chri&s;t according to the go&s;pel ofter and terms, and did endeavour parti|cularly to act faith on him, with re&s;pect to the mini&s;terial endowments, and did devote my &s;elf to him in that &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="030532_0160_0FE7A1619D1EA2B8">
<HI>May</HI> 1, 1700, being the day of his ordination. This morning I renewed my engagements to God, and accep|ted of Chri&s;t upon the go&s;pel terms, catting my&s;elf over open him, not only for what belongs to me as a private Chri&s;tian, but as a mini&s;ter, eyeing his &s;trength for through-boarance in the whole of the work, particularly pleading forents pre&s;ence this day; I cannot deny his pre&s;ence in &s;ector. Mr. Alexander Pitcairn mini&s;ter in Kilmeny preached the ordination &s;ermon, on Hebrews xiii. 17. Where he in&s;i&s;ted upon the watchmen's duty, I cannot deny, but my heart was much weighed with the &s;en&s;e of the greatne&s;s of the work, and after I had an&s;wer. ed the que&s;tions put to me concerning my loundne&s;s in the faith, and the &s;incerity of my purpo&s;es in underta|king king the office and work of the holy mini&s;try, I was or|dained. <HI>Lord, then knowe&s;t what my beart's de&s;ire to thee was in the time. O Lord, help, and through grace I &s;hall lay out my&s;elf for gaining finners to thee.</HI></P>
<P>Being thus entered into the mini&s;try, he &s;tudied and prepared his &s;ermens with much &s;erious &s;ecret prayer for divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance and direction in his work, and for a &s;ucce&s;sful ble&s;&s;ing upon the word, both to him&s;elf and his hearers.</P>
<P>His practice al&s;o was to review and remark his beha|viour, and acquitting him&s;elf in public duties, as to what a&s;&s;i&s;tance and enlargement he obtained, as to the gravity, ferion &s;ne&s;s, tenderne&s;s in his own frame, as to his con|cern for the &s;oul or hearers, as to the warming of his a&s;&s;ections with the comfons and ravithing &s;weetne&s;s of di|vine truths. And when he was remarkably helped, it i&s;&s;ued in thank&s;giving to God, and watching against vain pride and &s;elf, that that might not rob the Lord of the glory of his free grace. When otherwi&s;e, it was matter of humiliation to him.</P>
<P>Knowing that he was called to <Q>watch for &s;ouls, as one that mu&s;t give an account,</Q> he had the weight of the mienlerial charge much upon his &s;pirit: He was there fore at pains to acquaint him&s;elf with the &s;piritual &s;tate of the &s;ouls of his &s;tock, that he might be the more capable of dealing with them for their edification, according to their particular ca&s;es.

<P><HI>Of eternity and immortality.</HI></P>
<P>I had &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uggl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gs about the belief of eternity and immortality; but was very much quieted, I.

<P><HI>Of mini&s;ters con&s;ulting people in mini&s;terial duties</HI></P>
<P>While I had occa&s;ion to &s;peak and hear of &s;ome mini&s;|ters, their being &s;wayed much by the advice of good peo|ple, in dark &s;teps of their mini&s;terial work, I was &s;atis|fied in the evident clearne&s;s of the following rules.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it is very dangerous to lay too much &s;tre&s;s up on the advice and apprehen&s;ions of the be&s;t of people, as to what may be &s;in or duty in matters that belong not to their &s;tation; for the promi&s;e of the Spirit's teaching be|longs not to them, as to what may be the duty of the mini&s;ter's &s;tation: therefore,</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="167" REF="030532_0166_0FE7C3254F745068">
2. It is &s;afer to de&s;ire the help of their prayers, that God may, according to his promi&s;e, clear us, or di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cver to us what is duty, than to learn them to &s;tep out of their &s;tations, and advi&s;e in things that belong not to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In con&s;ulting with others for-light, regard would be had to the different talents of mens, and mo&s;t regard &s;hould be had in matters of &s;oul exerci&s;e, to tho&s;e whom the Lord has &s;itted with endowments that way: in mat|ters of government, mo&s;t regard &s;hould be had to tho&s;e whom the Lord has &s;itted that way.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. In judging if &s;uch are liklie&s;t to know the Lord's mind, who walk the mo&s;t clo&s;ely, we &s;hould con&s;ider, when we judge of the clo&s;ene&s;s of walk, not only what men's walk is, but what their temptations are; for one's walk may be much influenced that way, and grace may be more in one in whom it appears not &s;o much, than in others who appear to have more, when the one's grace is continually tried with floods of temptations plunging on it, and the other's is free.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>Ob&s;erve,</HI> Mini&s;ters for mo&s;t part are more &s;haken about the truths of religion, and the foundations, than about their own &s;tate: people more about their &s;tate than about the truths of religion. Mini&s;ters are helped to clear peo|ple, as to what they are &s;traitned abouts; and people are, or may be helpful to mini&s;ters in what they are in the dark about. Thus they mutually excel, and are excelled; to humble botli, and keep both in their &s;tations.</P>

<P><HI>Of legal preaching.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;aw the evil of legal preaching, which lies in one of two things, or in both&mdash;1. In laying to much &s;tre&s;s upon the works of the law, our duties and &s;trength: Or, 2, In pre&s;&s;ing evangelical doctrines without an eye to that which is the &s;pring of the church's edification, the Spirit of the Lord. Some pre&s;s to duties, &s;o that they &s;eem to think, that their rea&s;onings are able to enforce a compliance; or at lea&s;t, they do not take care to keep up upon them|&s;elves, and hearers both a con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of the contrary, in order to engage in eagerne&s;s in dependence upon the Spirit of the Lord: This is legal preaching. <HI>O Lord, thou knows how much of it is in the church.</HI> The go&s;pel glory is, that it is the mini&s;tration of the &s;pirit: The great pri|vilege of believers is, that the Lord <HI>manife&s;ts</HI> him&s;elf to them, as he does <HI>not to the world.</HI> When he manife&s;ts his authority in the command, it is then powerful: When he manife&s;ts his goodne&s;s and truth in the promi&s;e, it is full of &s;weetne&s;s: When he manife&s;ts his wrath in the threat|ening, it awes the &s;oul: When he manife&s;ts his glory in the face of Chri&s;t, it is ravi&s;hing, reforming, attracting.</P>
<P><HI>Athei&s;m the root of &s;in.</HI></P>
<P>Two thing I &s;hall note, 1. The Lord gave me a &s;weet di&s;covery this day in lecture, of the athel&s;m of the hearts of men, in rejecting the word, (notwith&s;tanding there are more, and more evident prints of God on it, than on all his other works of creation), becau&s;e they cannot get through &s;ome difficultier in it; whereas there are many more difficulties in the works of God: The light where by this was &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t home and illutrated in: particular in&s;tan|ces, was &s;weet. 2. Some days ago, reading Enod ix. and x. chapters, and finding this, <HI>that yet may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">w that I am God,</HI> frequently repeated, and el&s;ewhere in places innumerable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as the end of God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> manife&s;ting him&s;elf in his word and works: I ob&s;erve from it, that athei&s;m is deeply rooted even in the Lord's people, &s;eeing they need to be taught this &s;o much.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="030532_0168_0FE7C3276B2BC9D0">
That it is a high attainment in religion, to win to know that <HI>God is the Lord,</HI> (Dent. iv. 35.); and to believe that all &s;in is re&s;olvable in darkne&s;s and unbelief, as to this one point, <HI>that God is the Lord,</HI> and con&s;equently, that all &s;in is reducible to athei&s;m.</P>
<P>That the great difficulty which the whole of the divine revelation grapples with, is Athei&s;m; and that its &s;truggle is to recovery man to his fir&s;t impre&s;tions of a God. This one point comprehends the whole of man's recovery; as athei&s;m the whole of man's apo&s;tacy.</P>
<P>The Lord &s;aw meet to bring him through many &s;harp trials, and to keep him under much &s;oul exerci&s;e, in the vici&s;&s;itudes of di&s;couraging damps and refre&s;hing re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ls, upon his own &s;pirit; that in his mini&s;terial &s;tation he might, from his own experience, be the more capable of dealing &s;uitably with others, according to their various ca&s;es and conditions: He al&s;o &s;tudied much a clo&s;e ac|quaintance with his own &s;tate and frame, and was ob&s;erv|ant of the Lord gracious dealings with him, as may be gathered from following &s;hort hints.</P>
<P>July 2d, 1702: The Lord, about this time, giving &s;omewhat of a revival from a long deadne&s;s, I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay|&s;elf concerned to notice the means by which I obtained this benefit; and,

<ITEM>1. It was &s;ignally promoted by conver&s;e with lively Chri&s;tians: <HI>At iron &s;harpeneth iron, &s;o a man &s;harpeneth the countenance of his friend,</HI> Prov. xxvii. 17.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By &s;ome heavy &s;trokes laid on me, the Lord did cha&s;|ten me, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, <HI>teach me out of his law.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. By terrible providences with re&s;pect unto the public, the Lord did awaken me in &s;ome mea&s;ure: <HI>Awake, &s;leep|er, call on</HI> the name of <HI>thy God,</HI> Jonah i. 6.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4.

6. By leading me to &s;ome &s;ubjects which I chu&s;ed for others, wherein my own ca&s;e was al&s;o remarkably touched, the Lord did in &s;ome mea&s;ure awaken me: Thus while with David, I heard only a parable at fir&s;t, I was quickly told in the end, that I was <HI>the man.</HI></ITEM>

<P>MR.

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. At the &s;ame time the Lord did convince me, that
<PB N="178" REF="030532_0177_0FE7C2E3BB6108D8">it was not meet I &s;hould be alone, he al&s;o clearly convin|ced me, <HI>that a prudent wife is from the Lord;</HI> and there fore I looked, and cried to, and waited on the Lord &s;ot direction, with that eminent freedom, a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and pre|paration of heart, as gave me &s;ome ground to hope, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> he would incline his car to hear.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. My great difficulty was, as to the way whereby. I might know his mind, as to the per&s;on whom I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> chu&s;e and fix upon. The command, <HI>be not unequally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed</HI> together <HI>with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">believers,</HI> in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;eu&s;e, was powerfully impre&s;&s;ed upon my &s;oul, in &s;o much, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pro&s;pect of outward advantages what&s;omever, could have &s;wayed me to make choice of one whom I thought vold of the &s;e r of God. But whether in my choice to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ceed upon the information and te&s;timony of godly pro|ceeder, and concurring providences ju&s;tifying their te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> mony, and clearing the way; or whether per&s;onal and particular acquaintance were not previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> my &s;trait.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I inclined to think this la&s;t nece&s;iary, which did whatever pretences it was &s;upported withal, proceed from too much of a dependence on my own under&s;tanding, and that joined with a di&s;tru&s;t of the providence of God; which was the beginning of my mi&s;take.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The narrowne&s;s of my acquaintance, which was con|&s;ined to a very few of that &s;ex, increa&s;ed my &s;trait, and had a con&s;iderable influence into that wrong choice I made. The per&s;on I pitched on wanted not &s;everal things which I did di&s;like; yet &s;he appearing to be more &s;uitable than any of whom. I had acquaintance particularly; and falling at that time under &s;ome unu&s;ual concern about re|ligion, which &s;he did impart to me, it looked like a providential clearing of the way, and ground to hope the removal of what I di&s;liked in her walk; upon which I did too ha&s;tily proceed in the propo&s;al.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. I dur&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever ab&s;olutely pray for &s;ucce&s;s, but had great frecdom and liberty in pleading that the Lord would direct; and that if it were not for my &s;piritual advantage, it might be effectually cru&s;hed, and that my way might be hedged in.</ITEM>

<P>Meanwhile, this gentlewoman carried on an intrigue

And being thus happily di&s;|appointed in this, he fought direction of God in reference to a de&s;ign of marriage with another; and al&s;o &s;et apart &s;ame time expre&s;ly to this purpo&s;e.

<P>December 13, 1700. This forenoon I &s;et apart for prayer; and being to addre&s;s God in reference to my propo&s;al of marriage with J. W.

<P>January 17, 1701. This day was &s;et apart by J. W. and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, at parting, to be kept in order to our obtaining a ble&s;&s;ing upon our marriage.</P>
<P>In the morning I began this day with prayer, wherein I did endeavour to trace back &s;in to my very infancy, and found the Lord countenancing me, by bringing &s;in to remembrance. Lord, I have been in all &s;in; not one of
<PB N="182" REF="030532_0181_0FE7C2EAF65DD0F0">thy commands but I have broken, and that almo&s;t in all in&s;tances, &s;ave that I have been kept from the outward acts, and no thanks to me that it is &s;o; for Lord, thou knowe&s;t it was only thy re&s;training grace that kept me from any &s;in. O! how ignorant are they of their own natures, or el&s;e of how &s;ar different natures from mine are they, that deny original &s;in; it may be, &s;ome of them, had they been acquaint with my way and manner from my youth, would have been apt to think me of a good nature, and not given to ill; but O how ignorant are they who think &s;o! though I had not the en&s;nating influence of bad company to draw me a&s;ide, yet without tempta|tion I was inclined to &s;in, and that again&s;t nature's light, very early. Whatever others &s;peak of their good na|tures, Lord, I mu&s;t own mine &s;inful, and that all <HI>the maginations of the thoughts of my heart have been only evil from my youth up.</HI> When I look at my face in the gla&s;s of the holy law, Lord, how black is it! Nothing but &s;in wherever I &s;et mine eye.</P>
<P>The Lord helped me to confe&s;s &s;in, and did thereby give a fre&s;h &s;ight of the need of Chri&s;t in all his offices, of his excellency, &s;ufficiency, and &s;uitablene&s;s; and drew out my &s;ou! &s;olemnly to accept of him, renouncing all o|ther ways of &s;alvation, devoting my&s;elf in my &s;tation, as a mini&s;ter, to him, waiting for, and expecting from him (according to his mo&s;t gracious promi&s;e and office, as the Prince exalted to give gi&s;ts to men), &s;uch &s;upplies of gifts and grace, as are needful for my faithful acquittance in the di&s;charge of that office. Likewi&s;e I did &s;olemnly de|vote my&s;elf in this new relation I was to enter in, to him, pleading, that he would not contend with either of us for the &s;ins of our &s;ingle life, that he would make us holy, and grant us to walk before him, and that he would ble&s;s us with all the comforts of a married &s;tate, fitting us every way for one another.</P>
<P>In my &s;econd addre&s;s to God by prayer, the Lord gave me much &s;weetne&s;s and enlargement, in reference to that particular, for which I &s;et apart this day.

<P>Upon April 26th, 1710, he was, by the principal of the new college, admitted profe&s;&s;or of divinity there; and delivered his inaugural di&s;cour&s;e in confutation of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hei&s;tical pamphlet, intituled, <HI>Epi&s;tola Archimedis ad re|gem Gelomern.</HI></P>
<P>Being admitted profe&s;&s;or, he enjoyed not much &s;ound health in the exerci&s;e of that office: For in the begin|ning of April 1711, he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a dan|gerous pleuri&s;ie, which obliged his phy&s;icians to take from him a va&s;t quantity of blood. And though he was reliev|ed of that di&s;ea&s;e, yet he never fully recovered his for|mer &s;trength, by rea&s;on of the indi&s;po&s;ition of his &s;to|mach,
<PB N="192" REF="030532_0191_0FE7C2FF2D8F6808">and frequent vomiting, which prevented the re|gular &s;upply of blood for the nouri&s;hment of his body. Hereupon en&s;ued, in the following winter, a coldne&s;s, &s;welling and &s;tiffne&s;s in his legs, with frequent and ex|ce&s;&s;ively painful cramps. But be&s;ides his bodily indi&s;po&s;i|tion, the grievances of the church of Scotland did not a little add to his trouble. His &s;pirit was much weighted with the melancholy news of the toleration, and ic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">or|ing the power of pre&s;entations unto patrons, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> le&s;s with the impro&s;ing of the eath of abjuration upon mini&s;ters, from the apprehen&s;ions he had of the &s;ad effects that might follow upon their different &s;entiments about the Jaw fulne&s;s of that oath. He freely declared his own opinion in the meeting of the &s;ynod at St. Andrews, April 1712. And in conferences of the pre&s;bytery upon that matter, he ad|vi&s;ed, that mini&s;ters, after all due means of information, &s;hould act according to their light. But what he e&s;pecial|ly endeavonred to inculcate, as he had acce&s;s, was that the difference among them about the meaning of an ex|pre&s;&s;ion in that oath, gave-no ju&s;t ground for any aliena|tion of affection, or for divi&s;ion and &s;epatation, either a|mong mini&s;ters or people.</P>
<P><HI>An account of &s;ome of the la&s;t words of the reverend Mr.</HI> THOMAS HALYBURTON, <HI>profe&s;&s;or of divinity in St. Andrews, on his death bed, September,</HI>&mdash;1712.</P>
<P>WEDNESDAY, September 17th, when a friend came and a&s;ked him in the morning, how he had re&s;ted the by gone night? He an&s;wered, not well; and told, he had this night been &s;ore to&s;&s;ed with the thoughts of eternity; but, &s;aid he, I dare not &s;ay they were di&s;|tractiag. My evidences are much clouded indeed. I have been thinking on <HI>terribilia Dei,</HI> [i. c. the terrible things of GOD], and all that is difficult in death to a &s;aint. All my enemies have been round about me. I have had a great conflict, and faith like to fail. O! that I may be kept now in this la&s;t trial, that is en&s;uing, from being an offence to his people.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="030532_0192_0FE7C35629025E08">
Afternoon, when &s;ome of his brethren came in to vi&s;it him, he &s;aid to them, I am but young, and have little experience; but this death-bed now makes me old; and therefore I u&s;e the freedom to exhort you to faithfulne&s;&s; in the Lord's work. Ye will never repent this. He is a good ma&s;ter; I have always &s;ound him &s;o; if I had a thou&s;and lives, I would think them all too little to em|ploy in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>All this whole day, and &s;ome days preceding, he was under a cloud and de&s;ertion.</P>
<P>September 18, when a friend returned to a&s;k him how he was, in the morning; he broke &s;ilence with the&s;e words, O what a terrible conflict had I ye&s;terday! But now I can &s;ay, <HI>I have &s;ought the good fight, I have kept the faith.</HI> Now he has filled my mouth with a <HI>new &s;ong, Jebovah jireb, in the mount of the Lord, &amp;c. Prai&s;e, prai&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> comely for the upright.</HI> Shortly I &s;hall get another &s;ight of God than ever I had, and be more meet to prai&s;e him than ever. O the thoughts of an incarnate God are &s;weet and ravi&s;hing! and O! how do I wonder at my&s;elf, that I do not love him more, that I do not admire him more. O that I could honour him! What a wonder that I enjoy &s;uch compo&s;ure under all my bodily trouble, and in view of approaching death! O what a mercy that I have the u&s;e of my rea&s;on till I have declared his goodne&s;s to me!</P>
<P>To his wi&s;e he &s;aid, He came to me <HI>in the third watch of the night, walking upon the waters,</HI> and he &s;aid to me, I am <HI>Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, I was drad and am alive, and live for evermore, and have the keys of bell and death;</HI> and added, <HI>he &s;tilled the tempe&s;t,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad O there is a &s;weet calm in my &s;oul!</P>
<P>Thereafter, when defired to be tender of his health, he &s;aid, I'll &s;trive to la&s;t as long as I can, and I'll get my re&s;t ere it be long. I have no more to do with time, but to <HI>trap</HI> [i. e. &s;pend it thri&s;tily and piece-meal] it out for the glory of God.</P>
<P>Then he &s;aid, I'll &s;ee my Redeemer &s;tand on the earth at the la&s;t day; but I hope to &s;ec him before that, the <HI>Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne.</HI> O it will be a <HI>bonny</HI> [beautifulcompany: <HI>The &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made per|fect, and Je&s;us the mediator of the cover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">!</HI> O for

<P>After prayer, he called for a little water to wa&s;h his eyes, and &s;aid, I hope to get them wa&s;hen, and made like dove's eyes; and then farewel fin, farewel &s;orrow.</P>
<P>In a little, when taking &s;ome refre&s;hment, he &s;aid, ye &s;ee I am eating heartily here. I get &s;leep from him, and I get food and drink from him, and I'll get him&s;elf. <HI>My heart and my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ai!: But God in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of my heart, and my portion for ever</HI> &amp;c. but we have need of patience.</P>
<P>When one &s;aid, keep the light of the window from him, it may hurt his eyes; he &s;aid, <HI>Truly light is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and a plea&s;ant thing to behold the &s;un,</HI> the Sun of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. O brave light, where <HI>the Lamb is the light of that temple!</HI> We cannot have a conception of it now; <HI>eye hath not &s;een, nor car heard,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Seeing his younger child, he cau&s;ed bring her to him, and &s;aid, <HI>Mady,</HI> my dear, <HI>the Lord ble&s;s you; the God of your</HI> father, and of my father, <HI>ble&s;s you; the God that &s;od we all my life, the Angel that redeemed me from all evil, ble&s;s</HI> you, and the re&s;t, and be your portion. That is a goodly heritage, better than if I had crowns and &s;ceptres to leave you. My child I got you from him, and I give you to him again.</P>
<P>To his wife he &s;aid, My dear encourage your&s;elf in the Lord; he will keep you, though you even come a|mong enemies hands; &s;urely he will cau&s;e the enemy to treat you well. And then declaring his willingne&s;s to part with his deare&s;t relations, he &s;aid. This is the prac|tice of religion, &s;irs; this is a practical part of religion to make u&s;e of it when we come to the pinch: This is a le&s;&s;on of practical divinity.</P>
<P>When the phy&s;ician came in, he &s;aid, Is my pul&s;e weak, doctor? An&s;. Yes; but I have &s;een it as weak. Then he &s;aid, Doctor, as to this piece of work, you are near an end with it. I wi&s;h you may lay it to heart; it will come to your door too: And it is a bu&s;ine&s;s of great mo|ment to die like a Chri&s;tian. And it is a rarity. Chri&s;t him&s;elf has told us, that <HI>there are but few that &s;hall be &s;aved,</HI> even among them who are called outwardly. I

There is a reality in re|ligion, doctor; this is an age that hath lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of it. <HI>He has not &s;aid to the hou&s;e of Jacob, &s;eek ye may &s;ace us vain.</HI> Athei&s;is will &s;ee one day, whether it be &s;o or|not.</P>
<P>I ble&s;s God I was educated by godly parents, in the: principles of the church of Scotland: I ble&s;s him, that when I came to riper years, I did, on mature delibera|tion, make them my choice: I ble&s;s the Lord I have been helped ever &s;ince to adhere to them, without wa|vering: I ble&s;s him I have &s;een, that holine&s;s yields peace and comfort in pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity: What &s;hould I &s;eek more, or de&s;ire more, to give evidence of the reality of it? Therefore, <HI>I am not a&s;hamed of the go&s;|pol of Chri&s;t; becau&s;e it is the power of God to &s;alvation to every one that believeth.</HI> I am &s;o far from altering my thoughts of religion, by rea&s;on of the pre&s;ent contempt thrown on it, and oppo&s;ition made to it, that this endears it the more to me.</P>
<P>As to the &s;implicity of go&s;pel wor&s;hip, many mu&s;t have gaudy pomp now a days in wor&s;hip; it is an evi|vidence of the decay of religion; for when folk want the power and &s;pirituality of it, they mu&s;t have &s;omething to plea&s;e the carnal heart. This is my &s;en&s;e of it; and it is <HI>the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s;</HI> and I &s;peak as being &s;hoaly to appear in judgment; and hope to <HI>give an ac|count</HI> of this <HI>with joy,</HI> as a part of the <HI>te&s;timony of Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>Well, doctor, the Lord be with you, and per&s;uade you to be in earne&s;t. I return you thanks for you dili|gence. Is my pul&s;e low? An&s;. Yes. He replied, I am very well plea&s;ed. I would have been content to have bean away long ere now. I found my &s;pirits failing. It is but a few &s;trokes more, and <HI>victory, victory</HI> for ever|more, through the <HI>Captain of our &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>After a pau&s;e, he &s;aid, Every one that is in Chri&s;t Je|&s;us mu&s;t be a <HI>new creature;</HI> He mu&s;t have union with Chri&s;t, and a new nature: That is the ground work of religion. The Chri&s;tian religion is little under&s;tood by the mo&s;t part of us.</P>

O the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, how purely was it preached in this place, when I was at the univer&s;ity! though I found not the &s;weetne&s;s in the time, when I heard others preach on the&s;e &s;ubjects, I found it &s;ince; and it has fallen on me like &s;howers on the mown gra&s;s; vetily, there is a reality in religion: Few have the lively impre&s;|&s;ions of it.</P>
<P>Now get acquaintance with God; the little acquaint|ance I have had with God within the&s;e two days, has been better than ten thou&s;and times the pains I have all my life been at about religion.

<P>O there is a &s;trange hardne&s;s in the heart of man! I believe there are few men come to age, but, when they &s;ee others dying, have a conviction that they mu&s;t die, and yet are not duly affected with it. It is like one ri&s;ing <HI>from the dead,</HI> what they meet with. <HI>But they have Mo&s;es and the prophets; if they will not hear then, neither would they hear, though one &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead.</HI> We mu&s;t have an ear from God before we can hear. <HI>Ye hear not my words,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>becau&s;e ye are not of God.</HI> However, <HI>Whether</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olk <HI>will hear, or whe|ther they will forbear,</HI> it is our duty, whom the Lord I as employed to preach his go&s;pel, to &s;peak <HI>his word:</HI> And when we are dead and rotten, what we &s;peak of his word to the name of the Lord, it will <HI>take bold</HI> of them.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t have patience to wait till he come. <HI>Yet a lit|tle while, and be that &s;hall come, will come, and will not tarry;</HI> and till he come, <HI>the ju&s;t &s;hall live by &s;aith: But if any man draw back,</HI> &s;ays the Lord, <HI>my &s;oul &s;hall have no plea&s;ure in him.</HI> To point once heavenward, and then <HI>draw back,</HI> is a dangerous thing.</P>
<P>We are fooli&s;h creatures, we would have all the trial at our di&s;po&s;al, and limit the Lord as to the circum&s;tan|ces of our trial.

St. Andrews has finned a|gain&s;t as clear go&s;pel-light as ever &s;hone in the i&s;le of Bri|tain. I remember, when I was at the college, O how much of God was there in the preached go&s;pel!

<P>Afterwards, to his children he &s;aid, My bairns, I have nothing to &s;ay to you, but be &s;eekers of God, <HI>fulfil my joy.</HI> Ah! that I was &s;o long of beginning to &s;eck God; and yet I was touched with convictions that God was &s;eeking me ere I arrived at the years of &s;ome of you.</P>
<P>To his elde&s;t child he &s;aid, Ay, Margaret, you &s;eem &s;ometimes to have convictions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eware of them, they are the mo&s;t dangerous things that ever you meddled with; for if you &s;eek not God, each of them is God's me&s;&s;enger; and if you de&s;pi&s;e God's me&s;&s;enger he will be avenged on you.

<P>In the forenoon, to a gentlewoman he &s;aid, Madam, I wait for the &s;upplies of the Spirit of the Lord Je&s;us, whereby I may be able to fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy. I began a text at Ceres, (being his farewel &s;ermon), and &s;miling, &s;aid, I &s;ticked it, I went not through with it. When I came to St. Andrews, I began where I left at Ceres, <HI>I go bound to Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &amp;c. Acts xx. 22, 23.

I was very clear of God's calling me hither, come of it what will, whether I &s;ignify any thing or not. What would befal me I did not know, I had a very dark pro&s;pect, e&s;pecially from this place, that had &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed go&s;pel light; and that when he was taking away his &s;ervants here, it made me tremble to think that wrath was coming, and that I could do no|thing to hold it off; I can &s;ignify nothing.

<P>I have nothing to do with my li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, but yet to teap it, that I may lay it out for my God, for it is my duty to do it. What had I been if the grace of God had not

I was often &s;tealing from the Lord: but ble&s;&s;ed be his name, he made me lay it down again with &s;hame, and to cry, <HI>Not I,</HI> &amp;c. 1 Cor. xv. 10. I was ay afraid in public on that account.</P>
<P>He cau&s;ed read one of Mr. Rutherford's letters, (viz. to Mr. John Mein, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> letter), and thereafter faid, That is a book I would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">mmend to you all; there is more practical religion in that letter, than in a book of large volumes.</P>
<P>To a mini&s;ter that came in, he &s;aid, I am lying wait|ing for the &s;alvation of God; who &s;aid, mind what I &s;poke to you anent Mr. Ander&s;on, how gracicus the Lord had been to him, taking him away before the&s;e heart|breaking providences that have fallen cut &s;ince. He re|plied, I know there is a better end of it; the cau&s;e that is down will not bide down; I &s;aid it, I will venture my &s;oul on it, <HI>Say to Zion, thy God reign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th.</HI> Kings and mi|ni&s;ters of &s;tate, that build their &s;tate on the ruins of Zion, they and their buildings &s;hall be ruined and peri&s;h, and their memorial with them.

He an|&s;wered, What can a poor wretch &s;ignify? I'll tell you, brother, what I have thought a year and a day, I am no prophet, I pretend to know nothing but what the word of God leads to; my thoughts of taking off the &s;ervants of God at this time, are, I fear it is coming to that, that there is no &s;top to be put to the overflowing &s;courge: there is like to be a general overflowing con&s;umption, running over not only this, but all the reformed churches. Sovereignty I will not limit.</P>
<P>Afterward one was &s;howing the difficulty we would have, while in the body, with indwelling corruption. He an&s;wered. I oft find it; but the Lord has relieved me: I found this &s;ame night, even after the Lord gave relief, indwelling &s;in &s;hewing a great deal of &s;trength.

<P>To the apothecaty he &s;aid, The Lord is upholding me.

I give you this as a &s;olemn warning, if you come to be hard|ened by the frequent fights of per&s;ons in my circum&s;tan|ces, you may come to be hardened for ever, and your con&s;cience never be &s;en&s;ible more.</P>
<P>To three mini&s;ters in the place, he &s;aid, My dear bre|thren, ye are all there that are in the town, except my dear colleague, and I have &s;ent for him: Dear brethren, it is not from any con&s;idence in my&s;elf, but out of a &s;in|cere love to you, and from what I my&s;elf have felt, that for your encouragement I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, when the Lord helped to diligence in &s;tudying and meditating, I found him then remarkably &s;hining upon me, and te&s;tifying his approbation of a &s;incere mint. There is nothing to be had with a &s;lack hand.</P>
<P>Then to one of them lately entered into the mini&s;try he &s;aid, Your entry into the mini&s;try is like to fall in an evil day; there is one thing for your encouragement, you have a call: The times will make hard work to you in this place; but that that makes your work the harder, is, this people being hardened under a long tract of pure go&s;pel ordinances. However, be fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h&s;ul, and God will &s;trengthen to his own work. I will not &s;ay, ye will got things brought to what you would have; but i'll tell you, I have one thought, and I abide by it, if mini&s;ters ply
<PB N="200" REF="030532_0199_0FE7C41E36AD8730">their work, they cannot, it is true, bring per&s;ons to the Lord, but they may make their con&s;ciences knell; they will, they &s;peak for the Lord.</P>
<P>Then continuing his di&s;cour&s;e to the mini&s;ters, he &s;aid, Now, brethren, give diligence; for the Lord's &s;ake ply your work, <HI>hold fa&s;t what ye have.</HI> I mu&s;t have a word to my brethren, it is on my heart; I am young, but I am near the end of my life, and that makes me old. It becomes me to take advice from you; however, it is only to exhort to diligence, in the <HI>common &s;alvation.</HI> I repent I did not more, but I have peace in it, that what I did, I did it in &s;incerity; he accepts of the <HI>mite.</HI> It was the delight of my heart to preach the go&s;pel, and it made me &s;ometimes neglect a frail body. I ever thought, if I could contribute to the &s;aving of a &s;oul, it would be a flar, a crown, and a glorious crown. I knew this was the thing I aimed at; I defired to decrea&s;e, that the bride|groom might increa&s;e, and to be nothing, that he might all; and I rejoice in his highne&s;s. When one &s;aid, &s;o great attainments might be comfortable to him now. He replied, I lay no &s;tre&s;s thereon; the thing I rejoice in it, that his grace enabled me to this. Well, brethren, this is encouragement to you to try and go farther. Alas, I have gone no length; but I would &s;ain have gone far|ther: <HI>The hand of the diligent makes rich.</HI> Much &s;tudy, much prayer, temptations al&s;o, and di&s;tinct cutgates from temptations, are u&s;eful helps. I was fond enough of books; but I mu&s;t &s;ay, in the cour&s;e of my mini&s;try, what the Lord let me &s;ee of my ill heart, and what was nece&s;&s;ary again&s;t it, was more &s;teadable to me than all my books. One &s;aid, that was to believe, and therefore to &s;peak. He replied, the Lord help me to honour him; I de&s;ire no more, but to honour him here and hereafter.

When advi&s;ed to lie quiet a little, he &s;aid, whereon &s;hould a man be&s;tow his la&s;t breath, but in commending the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, God cloathed in our nature, dy|ing for our &s;ins? <HI>If plea&s;ed the Leed to brui&s;e him,</HI> Sec.

<P>To his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the pari&s;h he was tran&s;ported from, he &s;aid, I have this to &s;ay, as to my congregation, that people were my choice; with much peace and plea&s;ure I preached as I could, though not as I &s;hould, the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; though in all things I own my&s;elf to have finned exceedingly before the Lord, yet I have peace that I aimed with concern at leading them to the Lord Je&s;us; and another foundation can no man lay: I hope you will build on that &s;ame foundation, as you will, in that way, &s;ave your own &s;oul, &s;o it is the way to &s;ave them that hear you.

<P>Thereafter he &s;aid, If this be the day of the ending of my conflict, I would de&s;ire, even humbly to &s;eek of the Lord, that he would of his great mercy conde&s;cend to be tender to one that loves his appearance; that as he has dealt wonderfully and conde&s; endingly with me, &s;o he may even deal tenderly to the end, in loo&s;ing the pins of my tabernacle, and that I may be helped to honour God by a compo&s;ed re&s;ignation into his hand.

<P>September 19, about five in the morning, when he was de&s;ired to lie quiet, and try if he could re&s;t, he an&s;wered, no, no; &s;hould I lie here altogether u&s;ele&s;s? &s;hould not I &s;pend the la&s;t bit of my &s;trength, to &s;hew forth his glory? he held up his hands, and &s;aid, lame hands, and lame legs, (his hands and legs were greatly &s;welled), but &s;ee a <HI>lame man leaping and rejoicing.</HI></P>

<P>To a mini&s;ter he &s;aid, now, &s;ir, though I will not li|mit the Lord as to time, I am expecting the on&s;et from the la&s;t enemy; and I know not but I may get many ene|mies about me are then.</P>
<P>Then exhorting &s;ome to think on death, he &s;aid, to mind death is a pio&s;itable thing: To mind death is not to go church yards and vi&s;it tombs; but it lies in this, to be habitually under the impre&s;&s;ions of death, in its ri&s;e and cau&s;e, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate and relation to both covenants, the various i&s;&s;ues and con&s;equences of it, and the way of delivery from it, and all the circum&s;tances attending it.</P>
<P>Then as to his &s;piritual enemies, he &s;aid, But I think. I am now almo&s;t out of their hands. One &s;aid, that is a great victory.

One &s;aid, we &s;hall neither under mercies nor afflictions be free of this trial. He &s;aid, O &s;trange, that when death has been &s;o lo g kept in view, that it &s;hould be &s;o! One &s;aid, you have rea&s;on to count that a victory, that the Lord has helped you over your late &s;ears: You know what a damp you was under on Wedne&s;day, and what a &s;weet outgate you got. He an&s;wered, I de&s;ire to ble&s;s his name for it; but I &s;hould be yet under as great a damp, if he &s;hould withdraw: Holy &s;e..r, caution and jealou&s;y, is &s;till needful.</P>
<P>After that, to the mini&s;ters he &s;aid, brethren, you are there: In ca&s;e I &s;hould be &s;urpri&s;ed, I take this oppor|tunity to acknowledge your tenderne&s;s to me, that I am mo&s;t unworthy of it in many re&s;pects: I can &s;ay, I de|&s;ired to live in love with you and I ble&s;s God there was

<LETTER>
<P>HAVING, in another paper apart, made &s;uch a di&s;|po&s;ition of my worldly concerns, as I thought mo&s;t expe|dient for my family, I did think my&s;elf bound moreover, by this pre&s;ent te&s;tament and latter will, to declare my &s;entiments and &s;en&s;e as to religion; being hitherto, thio'
<PB N="212" REF="030532_0211_0FE7C379CDADA1F8">the mercy of God, in the full and compo&s;ed exerci&s;e of any rea&s;on and judgment that God has given me, though: otherwi&s;e very trail in body: And this I am the rather inclined to, as a te&s;timony again&s;t the growing apo&s;tacy of the day we live in, and in expre&s;&s;ion of my earne&s;t con|cern to have all with whom I have any influence or in|tere&s;t to adhere to the truth and way of God, in oppo&s;i|tion to that general inclination to apo&s;&s;acy, in principle and practice, that prevails at this day.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place then, I do ingenuou&s;ly acknowledge, that I came into the world a defiled, polluted branch of apo&s;tate Adam, under the guilt of his &s;in, tainted with the pollution of &s;in derived from him; having a heart full of alienation from, and enmity again&s;t God; in a word, a <HI>child of wrath, and heir of bell.</HI> And long did I follow the bent of this corrupt nature, going on, not|with&s;tanding reclaiming means of all forts, from evil to wor&s;e, though mereifully re&s;trained from tho&s;e more open &s;candals, that bring reproach before the world: In a word, I had ruined my&s;elf, and could do nothing for my own recovery, and mu&s;t have been everla&s;tingly ruined in this ca&s;e, if the Lord, in tender mercy, had not looked upon me.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, on the other hand, and the Lord knows I do it with much cheerfulne&s;s of heart, ble&s;s the Lord, who calt my lot in a land where the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and the way of &s;alvation by him, is clearly, plainly, and purely revealed and preached, wherein the pure ordinances of God's wor&s;hip, without the mixture of men's inventions, have through the mercy of God been kept up, and the beautiful order of his hou&s;e maintained, according to the rule of his word. I ble&s;s the Lord that he &s;o order|ed it, that I was born in a religious family of godly pa|rents, and that I had this to &s;ay, that God was my fa|ther's God, and that I had been earne&s;tly and &s;eriou&s;ly by them devoted to him: And whereas I early &s;ubjected my&s;elf to other lords in my childhood and youth, I ble&s;s and adore the Lord, that by his word and Spirit, he cea&s;ed not to be a reprover, reclaimer, and to &s;trive with me, until, by a day of power, he made me cheer|fully give up with tho&s;e abominations, and return to the
<PB N="213" REF="030532_0212_0FE7C3D5CA0DEDC8">God of my fathers. Long did I &s;truggle again&s;t the Lord's work, but, prai&s;es to free grace, he proved &s;tron|ger than I, and overcame me, and I rejoice in his high|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I ble&s;s the Lord, though by many provocations of all forts, I hare given him ju&s;t ground to abandon me quite, yet he has not &s;o done; nay, even when I was as a bea&s;t before him, he held me by the hand, and left me not to run away. O a&s;toni&s;hing, &s;overeigaty of grace! I ble&s;s the Lord, that when I &s;tood trembling under the tetrors of God's law, he &s;ea&s;onably &s;aved me from de&s;|pair, by &s;ome di&s;covery of the ble&s;&s;ed way of &s;alvation for &s;elf de&s;troyed &s;inners, through a &s;lain Saviour; even &s;uch a di&s;covery, as made me re&s;olve to part with all, that I might have the <HI>field,</HI> Chri&s;t the trea&s;ure hid in it, and <HI>pearl of price.</HI> There is nothing I dread &s;o much as a mi&s;take in this matter; it is Chri&s;t only that will an|&s;wer me and my ca&s;e; and without him I am undone; on him, the efficacy of his &s;ufferings, the power of his re&s;urrection, and of his whole mediation as revealed in the go&s;pel, do I build all my hope.</P>
<P>I ble&s;s the Lord, that ever he honoured &s;uch a &s;inful unworthy worm, to preach the glorious go&s;pel of his Son: I confe&s;s I have but ill managed this glorious tru&s;t; and my manifold corruptions made me a &s;inner in all I did, exceedingly; yet &s;o far us I do know my own heart, it was the life of my life to <HI>preach Chri&s;t crucified,</HI> and deal with con&s;ciences about accepting of him; nor dur&s;t I deal coldly or indifferently, in a matter wherein I knew my own and hearer's &s;alvation to eternity did depend. Herein this day I have peace, and I know that in this matter I &s;hall never have ground of regret. I mu&s;t bear my honourable ma&s;ter that te&s;timony, that he never bid me go any part of my warfare upon my own charges; if I was &s;traitened it was in my own <HI>bowels;</HI> as to him I always found, "&s;pend and have in his &s;ervice, was the be&s;t thri&s;t;" when I was helped freely to give what free|ly I had received, I never wanted then <HI>&s;eed</HI> for &s;owing, and <HI>bread</HI> for the eater, and I hope &s;ometimes a <HI>ble&s;&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>I ble&s;s God, that he has ca&s;t an in&s;ignificant worm's lot among tho&s;e to whom his weak labours were not: unaccept|able;
<PB N="214" REF="030532_0213_0FE7C37BDF58DB48">and I look upon it as a high privilege to have the countenance of the &s;aints, the <HI>excellent o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of the earth;</HI> I h ve de&s;ired to live with them here, and de&s;ire to have my lot with them eternally hereafter. I have peace this day, that through his merciful hand, I have been kept from making any worldly intere&s;t the main de&s;ign; it is to his grace only I owe this, as every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>I ble&s;s the Lord, that I have been happily try&s;ted in the &s;everal places wherein I lived, with kind, affectionate, u&s;eful fathers and brethren to me, with whom I have liv|ed with much delight and &s;atisfaction, and for whom I ble&s;s the Lord heartily.</P>
<P>In a word, I de&s;ire to join my in&s;igni&s;icant te&s;timony unto that of the glorious cloud of witne&s;&s;es; and parti|cularly I do atte&s;t, as my fixed per&s;ua&s;ion, that Chri&s;t only has the <HI>words of eternal life;</HI> that the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> only has <HI>brought life and immortality to light;</HI> that this ble&s;t revelation is a|ble <HI>to make wi&s;e to &s;alvation every one that believeth.</HI> I mu&s;t bear a te&s;timony, that the way of holine&s;s is the way of peace, and the way of plea&s;antne&s;s, and that go&s;pel ordinances, in their native &s;implicity and purity, are ble&s;ted and effectual means of communion and <HI>fellow&s;hip with the Father and with the Son.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ee a generation, that has lo&s;t long ago any thing of the power of religion &s;ome of them once &s;eemed to have, ha&s;tening fa&s;t to an utter rejection of the purity of go&s;pel-ordinances, and &s;trongly inclined to &s;ub&s;titute in their room that dead carea&s;e of forms, ceremonies, and &s;uper|&s;titions, which England at her reformation, regarding po|litical con&s;iderations more than the rule of church retor|mation, retained to the un&s;peakable prejudice of &s;ouls, and to the endangering one day or other, the whole of the Chri&s;tian religion there; it being vi&s;ible, that among tho&s;e who adhere to them, the power of religion is &s;till wearing lower and lower: and nothing could induce this generation to the change, but their utterignorance of the power of religion; and &s;omething men mu&s;t have. It is obvious, the change is net of God; the lives of the zealots for it demon&s;trate this, with the oppo&s;ition made by them unto &s;erious godline&s;s, and the encouragement given unto pro&s;ane per&s;ons, if they will but join with
<PB N="215" REF="030532_0214_0FE7C3DB83D913B0">them in this party-de&s;ign. In a word, my &s;en&s;e of it is, that it flows from the want of a &s;en&s;e of the &s;pirituality that God requires in his wor&s;hip, and is likly to i&s;&s;ue in the lo&s;s of all religion. Such as now ca&s;t at the purity and &s;implicity of religion, and put forms in its room, are likely, are long, as we have &s;een in&s;tances, to &s;et the form a packing too.</P>
<P>In a word, all in God's way, in his word, is glorious, honourable, and like him&s;elf, he needs none of cur te&s;|timonies; but it is the lea&s;t than we can do, to &s;ignify our good will to have his prai&s;es celebrated; and I, be|ing &s;o many ways obliged, take this &s;olemn occa&s;ion to acknowledge, before I leave the world, the&s;e among the innumetable other obligations, and de&s;ire to bequeath this, as my be&s;t legacy to my family, even my &s;erious and &s;olemn advice, to make <HI>choice of God for their God;</HI> he has been my father's God, the God both of my wife's predece&s;&s;ors and mine; he has been, we hope, our God; and I recommend him to my children for their God, &s;o|lemnly charging thein, as they will be an&s;werable in the great day, all of them, to make it their fir&s;t care to &s;eek after peace with God, and reconciliation through Chri&s;t cruci&s;ied; and being reconciled, make it their perpetual &s;tudy to plea&s;e him in all things. I be&s;eech them, with all the bowels of a father, as they love their &s;ouls, &s;it not down &s;hort of &s;aving acquaintance with him, wait dili|gently upon the means of grace, and attend the wor&s;hip of God in all duties, &s;ecret e&s;pecially, family likewi&s;e, and carefully attend public ordinances; beware of content|ing your&s;elves with the more form of the&s;e duties, but cry to the Lord for communion with him in them, and the our-pouring of his Spirit, whereby you may be ena|bled to <HI>wor&s;hip God,</HI> who is a &s;pirit, <HI>in &s;pirit.</HI> It is my charge to you, and that which I am above all things rela|ting to you concerned in, that ye follow God; follow him early, follow him fully, without turning a&s;ide to the right or left hand.

<P>To &s;ome pre&s;ent he &s;aid, O &s;irs, I dread might<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, that a rational &s;ort of religion is coming in among us; I mean by it, a religion that con&s;i&s;ts in a bare attendance on c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t|ward duties and ordinances, without the power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> godli|ne&s;s; and thence people &s;hall &s;all into a way of &s;erving God, which is more dei&s;m, having no relation to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and the Spirit of God. To his colleagne he &s;aid, Dear brother, let not mode&s;ly hinder you from laying out your talent that way; God has given you abilities. Well, brother, to encourage you, I mu&s;t teli you, I mu&s;t &s;ay it, your conver&s;ation has been a ble&s;&s;ing to me; our mutual communication about the concerns of the Lord was reviving. It was after a &s;weet night's communica|tion of this &s;ort, that God took the burden of my &s;on George off me, and brought me to &s;weet &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ni&s;&s;ion in the pro&s;pect of his approaching death. O if we could be con|cerned about God's intere&s;t, he would look well to ours.</P>
<P>Then he &s;aid, if I had all our brethren pre&s;ent now, I would tell them how much it is upon my heart, that they

One &s;aid, I have ob&s;erved that that has been many times the greate&s;t trial of the church of Scotland. Alas! the &s;atal lengths that divi&s;ion came in time of per&s;ecution, and not without the influence of &s;ome by their preaching, has brought us to that pa&s;s, that we are not like to reco|ver. He &s;aid, O what a care has God of me, that is hiding me from the evil to come? I was willing to &s;tand my po&s;t with you, to &s;tand and fall with the church of Scotland; but my ma&s;ter is calling me off. O, I pity, I pity them that &s;tay behind. I am no prophet, I do not pretend to prophecy; but I am per&s;uaded a form is com|ing on this church. One &s;aid, I hope, brother, the Lord will not quit his room in Scotland. He an&s;wered, indeed. I hope not; but I much doubt if this gener<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion will be honoured to do God great &s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice, and &s;ee good days.

<P>Then to &s;ome pre&s;ent he &s;aid, Do ye think that he will come and receive the <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">er of hope</HI> the day? Whether he do or no, holy and righteous is be, but I confe&s;s I long for it. This is va&s;tly more that I am bearing than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ay deaths, and yet the Lord bears up &s;weetly with his power. Were it not the power of grace, nature would di&s;tract under what I have upon me even now, but the Lord upholds me. I do not weary, but the hireling longs for his wages. He &s;eems in his adorable wi&s;dom to try me further, and holy and reverend is his name; he is not wanting to me. One &s;aid, Well, that is enough, if he is now giving you a heavy burden to bear, be gires you &s;uch remarkable &s;upply. He &s;aid, I de&s;ire only grace to be <HI>faithful to the death</HI> unto the Lord Je&s;us, unto my God, until I come to the land of prai&s;es, even to jeru&s;a|lems gares, to pay thanks to the name of the God of Ja|cob. One &s;aid, You have his promi&s;e for through-bearing, and he cannot &s;ail in performing it. I hear the defluxion has been unea&s;y to you the night. He an&s;wered, Yea, yea; but O keep me from impatience, or charging my God fooli&s;hly. One &s;aid, It is weak faith that cannot believe, when it has &s;uch a &s;upport of &s;en&s;ible comfort as you have. He an&s;wered, the hundredth part of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would have put me into a diffraction, if the Lord
<PB N="236" REF="030532_0235_0FE7C3A749A86D68">had not &s;u&s;tained me. This is his day, it is his holy re&s;t. I long for the re&s;t; I long for this de&s;irable re&s;t. One &s;aid, We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, you have reached a will &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his. He an&s;wered, It takes a great deal of hammering to po|li&s;h us, and make us meet for the inheritance of the &s;aints in light.</P>
<P>To his &s;on he &s;aid, My dear David, I am lying here man, finding how good God is; and I would fain have my David, I would fain have you God's, and acquaint with his way, that when I am dead, I may live in you, and you may tell to the generation not born, how good God is. O man, if I had you a &s;eeker of God, I would think my&s;elf happy in it. Then a mini&s;ter a&s;ked, if he &s;hould pray. He an&s;wered, Yea, yea, pray for me.</P>
<P>After prayer, he &s;aid, This night my &s;kin has burnt, my heart has panted, my body has been, brui&s;ed on the bed with weakne&s;s, and there is a &s;ore upon me that is racking my &s;pirit, and my heart has been &s;ometimes like to fail: and yet I cannot &s;ay, but the Lord, after all this trouble holds me in health in the mid&s;t of all. If the Lord give &s;uch &s;upport, and continue me years in this, I have no rea&s;on to complain. One &s;aid, No hypocrite is able to counterfeit that language in &s;uch a ca&s;e as you are in. He an&s;wered, It is as great a wonder to me, as to any about me. Brother, I know not whether I may not de|&s;ire you to beg of the Lord, with re&s;pect to your body, even to pity and to &s;horten, if it be his will, my trial; the hireling longs for his wages; but I have rer&s;on to do it with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thereafter he &s;aid, My body has got &s;uch a hurt, that I believe I will &s;carce recover it; and that is the thing that keeps all my body in a fire. The panting for want of breath is over; but O it is the mercy of God that keeps me compo&s;ed. This trouble of my bowels draws my &s;tomach and all together as if it were with cords: And yet I mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>What am I, and what is my father's hou&s;e, that God b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s brought me hitherto.</HI> One &s;aid, You have re&s;igned your&s;elf to his will and plea&s;ure; and he will &s;trengthen you with patience; he gives &s;trength for the burden. He an&s;wered, He has done it hitherto, I have a heart warm to God, and I have a carnal heart too.

<P>To the mini&s;ter he &s;aid, The Lord has been &s;till with me. I am carnal, but I long for a deliverance from the remainders of a body of &s;in. I long for a deliverance from this trouble; if God lengthen it out, if he give me more troubles, then why not, righteous is his name. I know not what alteration may be. I long indeed for a &s;hare of that everla&s;ting re&s;t; and I confe&s;s I am like a bird on the wing, and I would fain be at Immanuel's land, where the tree of life is.

I could have &s;carce believed, though I had been told it, that I could have been kept in the right ex|erci&s;e of my judgment under this racking pain. The drawing of the brea&s;t &s;eems to me to be, as if I were all hung together, all pulled together: So that I would make that improve ent, whatever comes of it, I am &s;ure I am a demon&s;tration that there is a reality in religion; and I rejoice in this, that God has honoured a &s;inful worm, &s;o as to be a demonitration of his grace. I am preaching the go&s;pel. I have a di&s;pen&s;ation committed to me, &s;hame belongs to me; I am a &s;inner, the prai&s;e of all belongs to him; <HI>worthy is the Lamb, to receive glory.</HI> I hope I &s;hall &s;hortly be at that glory I have been long expect|ing: though I come not near Mr. Shield's glory, nor Mr. Ander&s;on's, &amp;c.

Dear friends about me, take the commendation off my hand; while I live I mu&s;t preach the go&s;pel: He has given me a while yet here, that &s;hould be reckoned precious, and I

He cau&s;ed read P&s;alm lxxxiv. and &s;ing the latter part of it, and pray: And after prayer, he having joined in &s;inging, &s;aid, I had always a mi&s;tuned voice, a bad ear, bat which is wor&s;t of all, a mi&s;tuned heart; but &s;hortly, when I Join the temple &s;ervice above, there &s;hall not be, world without end, one &s;tring of the affections out of tune.

Though I was one well near the &s;aying, my <HI>hope, my &s;trength is peri&s;hed from the Lord;</HI> yet the Lord rebuked that. My unbelief was very impudent in urging &s;ugge&s;tions.

<P>To one he &s;aid, Another me&s;&s;enger comes for me, a cough. O man, I am bindly dealt with! The Lord has done wonderful things.

<P>I am calling you to &s;ee a miracle, God is melting me down into corruption and du&s;t, and yet he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeping me in a calm.

Is there not a beauty in this providence?</P>
<P>After a wre&s;tling with defluxion in his throat, he &s;aid, The Lord has &s;ent another me&s;&s;enger for me, to ha&s;ten me home. The other day I would have been away without this glorious evidence of the grace of God; but this is more for my advantage, that I am thus tried and com|forted.

<P>To his &s;on he &s;aid, David, come man, O &s;eek thy fa|ther's God. I am like the &s;lave born in God's hou&s;e, and I, my wi&s;e and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irns, are the Lord's, therefore let your ear be bored to his door po&s;t, and be his &s;ervant for ever: and if ye &s;erve him, my God will ble&s;s you, he will ble&s;s you for ever. Come, my dear, your grandfa|ther and grandmother are in heaven. Is it not hard, man, to die well, for them that do not know God in Chri&s;t? If you knew the &s;ore &s;kin that I have, you would cry and greet, [i. e. weep]. I am not greeting nor cry|ing. How glad would I be, if I knew my little &s;tock, David, would be a witne&s;s for God, a &s;ufferer for the name of Chri&s;t, <HI>&s;triving and re&s;i&s;ting even unto blood.</HI> I had rather have you &s;uch, than an emperor of the uni|ver&s;e, and would rejoice more in it. Where I called to it, I would &s;pond my blood, and go through fire and wa|ter for it.</P>
<P>Then he &s;aid, if I would &s;ay, that I would &s;peak no more in the name of the Lord, it would be like a fire within my brea&s;t. I was early <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">au&s;ing with my&s;elf, how I would &s;tand the &s;hock, and be a martyr again&s;t popery: I lay one night mu&s;ing about it, and &s;lept none, &amp;c. (See pages 42, 43.)</P>
<P>When &s;ome looked to him as if they had been amazed, he &s;aid, Why look ye &s;tedfa&s;tly on me, as if by my might or power, I were &s;o? <HI>Not I, but the grace in me;</HI> it is the Spirit of God that &s;upports me. I am here on a death bed, going to heaven. 'Tis but a little time, and corruption will be rai&s;ed in inconuption.</P>
<P>To his daughter he &s;aid, Margate, I charge you to &s;eek early the God of your father; he is a wonder-working God.</P>
<P>To his wife be &s;aid, Be not di&s;couraged, my dear, at the unavoidable con&s;equences of nature which I was un|der,

<P>To another of his daughters, he &s;aid, Janet, O &s;eek God; he is good, he will be a better father than I am; you are born in his hou&s;e. I have not a child, I have given you all to him; I leave you to the abundant grace of God. I am much concerned for the young generation; I fear they &s;hall all ca&s;t at religion together.</P>
<P>To a gentlewoman in the pari&s;h of Cores, he &s;aid, Be|hold your dying mini&s;ter; I am ha&s;tening to eternity; and ha&s;tening to heaven as fa&s;t as I can: I am dying in the faith of the&s;e truths I preached among you; you may remember I preached on that text, <HI>When I heard, my belly trembled: My lips quivered at the voice: Rottenne&s;s entered into my bones, and I trembled in my&s;elf, that I might ra&s;t in the day of trouble,</HI> Hab. iii. 16. Then you may re|member, I told you, that <HI>there was a re&s;t</HI> to the Lord's people even in trouble; and now I &s;eal this re&s;t. O! I am well hired to all this; I have perfect compo&s;ure of &s;pirit, perfect peace without any roving, or any thing that is the effect of di&s;order: O what wonderful power is that! Tell my pari&s;hioners, that my God is ble&s;&s;ing me, that the &s;ingle mints I made at &s;erving him in preach|ing the go&s;pel of his Son, the Lord has already reward|ed it to a miracle: Now I find the <HI>go&s;pel the power of God to &s;alvation,</HI> all &s;urts of &s;alvation. All in our reli|ligion is experimental, it will bide the proof. Well, mi&s;tre&s;s, God ble&s;s you, and ble&s;s your bairns, and make them a ble&s;&s;ing to you; &s;eek God, make earne&s;t of religion. <HI>O what &s;hall I render to the Lord!</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed be God that he gives &s;o honourable an occa&s;ion to commend him.</P>

Now, firs, here is &s;omething to be improven for a while, it will take telling; there is tel|ling in this providence, it will co&s;t me telling to eternity. If there be &s;uch a glory in his conduct about me now, O what will be in that, to &s;ee the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne, to &s;ee the Lamb that was &s;lain in the mid&s;t of the throne, the Lamb that has the &s;even horns, and the &s;even eyes? I have peace in the mid&s;t of pain; and O how much of that I have had for a time pa&s;t! My peace has been like a river, not a di&s;compo&s;ed thought. There has been &s;ome little &s;ugge&s;tions &s;ince I got the great a&s;&s;ault of my enemies in one league together; I got one a&s;&s;ault, and I was like to fall: But &s;ince the Lord rebuked them, there is not a di&s;compo&s;ed thought, but all calm.</P>
<P>To the mini&s;ters he &s;aid, Brethren, ble&s;s God on my behalf, and pray I may be helped, I have been grappling with the king of terrors, and I find he is conquerable; I found the rattling of his drum in my throat, (meaning the choaking defluxion in his throat), and I was not affrighted: I am melting away bravely.</P>
<P>To two of the &s;tudents he &s;aid, Well, lads, you &s;ee your dying ma&s;ter confined within the&s;e four &s;toops, and by the grace of God he is what he is, he is dying as one unto whom the Lord is &s;hewing him&s;elf marvellou&s;ly good: This is no roving of a &s;ick man; I ble&s;s God I never had my judgment more di&s;tinct all my days, an evidence of the reality of religion. When the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion came up, he called for a little twi&s;t, and &s;aid, I think all the &s;ub|&s;tance of my body &s;hall evacuate this way. But with a &s;miling countenance &s;aid, it is welcome: Now, my bo|dy is wa&s;ting like a piece of brae [i. e. a bank] by a mighty current; and yet the power of God keeps me up.</P>

To a gentlewoman he &s;aid, You are come to &s;ee your old dying friend, a wonder indeed, but a wonder of mer|cy: I have preached from the pulpit, but now I am preach|ing from a death-bed; and I would be conrent, if &s;en&s;i|ble pre&s;ence were continued, to &s;peak till fle&s;h and bones were wa&s;hen and wa&s;ted to nothing.

The God of glory appeared to me; and the fir&s;t &s;ight I got of him, was &s;uch, as it wan my heart to him, &s;o as it was never loo&s;ed; though I have had many wanderings, yet I can &s;ay, I was never my&s;elf till I wan back to the center again. Follow me, take my word for it, he is a good matter, ye will never rue the &s;ervice; and I am well hired to it. He took a little rattle in his throat, and &s;aid, This may be irk&s;ome to you; but every me&s;&s;enger of death is plea&s;ant to me, and I am only detained here, that I may trumpet forth his prai&s;e a little longer.</P>
<P>About noon he &s;aid, I was ju&s;t thinking on the plea|&s;ant &s;pot of earth that I will get to lie in, be&s;ide Mr. Rutherford, Mr. Forre&s;ter, principal Ander&s;on, &amp;c. and I will come in as the little one among them, and I will got my plea&s;ant George in my hand; and O we will be a knot of bonny [i. e. comely] du&s;t. Then he &s;aid, it will not be all my &s;ore bones that will make me weary yet, as long as God gives me a tongue to &s;peak, and judgment to con|ceive, to preach the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>He broke out in frequent admiration with the greate&s;t warmne&s;s at what he &s;elt: Strange, &s;aid he, this body is wa&s;hing away to corruption, and yet my intellectuals are &s;o lively, that I cannot &s;ay there is the lea&s;t alteration, the lea&s;t decay of judgment or memory; &s;uch vigorous actings of my &s;pirit towards God, and things that are <HI>not &s;een!</HI> but, &s;aid he, <HI>Not I, not I, but the grace of God in me.

<P>Then to &s;ome mini&s;ters when they came in, he &s;aid, What a demon&s;tration has God given you and me of the immortality of the &s;oul, by the vigour of my intellectuals, and the lively actings of my &s;pirit after God, and the things of God, now when my body is &s;o low, and al&s;o pained.</P>

But, &s;aid the mini&s;ter, you will obtain the victory through the Captain of &s;alvation, who, you know, is able to keep what you have commit|ted to him.</P>
<P>When he revived, after a &s;evere &s;hock, he &s;aid, I am defeat; and added, I am &s;hipwrecked into health again.
