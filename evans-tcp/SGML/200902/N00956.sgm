Thus it was with the People of <HI>Judah,</HI> they were at pre&s;ent in great Pro&s;perity: <HI>I&s;a</HI> 2.7. <HI>Their Land is full of Silver and Gold, neither is there any end of their trea&s;ures, their Land is al&s;o full of Hor&s;es, neither is there any end of their Cha|riots.</HI> But they carried them&s;elves very bad|ly: We have an Account in general, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. <HI>v.</HI> 8, 9 <HI>Their tongue and their doings are again&s;t the Lord to provoke the Eyes of his Glory, the &s;how of their Countenance doth witne&s;s again&s;t them, and they declare their Sin as Sodom, and hide it not.</HI> In particular they were guilty of Idolatry, <HI>Chap</HI> 2 <HI>v.</HI> 8. <HI>Their Land is full of.

For the under&s;tanding of the words,</P>
<P>Con&s;ider;</P>
<P N="1">1. Who he would take away? <HI>A.</HI> In general, U&s;efull Men: &s;uch as in their &s;eve|ral Capacities were very Serviceable and Pro|fitable to the Common-wealth; Men that were an honour to the Land, and capable to advance and promote the Wellfare of it. Some by rea&s;on of their injoyments, as the <HI>Mighty Men:</HI> &s;ome by rea&s;on of their qualifications, as the <HI>Prudent,</HI> the <HI>Artificer,</HI> and the <HI>Oratour:</HI> &s;ome by rea&s;on of their experi|ence, as the <HI>Ancient:</HI> &s;ome by rea&s;on of the Offices and Stations that they were in, in the Common wealth, as the <HI>Judge,</HI> the <HI>Prophet,</HI> the <HI>Coun&s;ellor,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. How does he threaten to take them a|way? <HI>A.</HI> As a Judgment on the Publick Society. There might be anger again&s;t &s;ome of them: &s;ome of them might be taken away in anger again&s;t them&s;elves, as <HI>Saul: God took him away in his wrath, Ho&s;.</HI> 13 11. Some of them may be taken away in mercy to them&s;elves: <HI>they are taken away from the Evil to come, I&s;a.</HI> 57 1. But here it is threatned as a Publick Calamity; that which enfeebles the Common wealth, and expo&s;es them to &s;orrow. God may take &s;uch away by Mor|tality, in Battle, by Captivity: he does not
<PB N="4" REF="001146_0006_0FB08EF4C7A1EB20">&s;ay that he will take away all &s;uch, but many of them.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>There is many times a Great Frown in</HI> GODS <HI>taking away tho&s;e that are Eminently &V;&s;efull.</HI></Q>
<P>GOD has many ways to puni&s;h a di&s;obe|dient People; &s;ometimes he puni&s;hes them by Wars, by Sickne&s;&s;es, by Inundations, by Earthquakes, by Fires, by Bla&s;tings, by a Spi|rit of Divi&s;ion; this is one among the re&s;t, by the Death of U&s;efull men. There may be a great Frown in Gods taking away &s;uch Young men, as were hopefull to be men for Publick Service; as when he took away <HI>Je|roboams</HI> Son: &s;o e&s;pecially when he takes a|way &s;uch as were men of Service: this is not alwayes a Frown, for if God have no Controver&s;y with his People, yet &s;uch mu&s;t dye according to the cour&s;e of Nature; but ordinarily it is a Frown: U&s;efull and Servi|ceable men are a Publick Ble&s;&s;ing; and it is a Publick Frown when God removes them: as God Frowns upon a People, when he takes a|way their Health, their Peace, their Wealth;
<PB N="5" REF="001146_0007_0FB08EF76AF423B8">&s;o he does likewi&s;e when he takes away tho&s;e that were a means to pre&s;erve their &s;piritual and outward Pro&s;perity: Men that are emi|nently U&s;efull are the Pillars of the Church &amp; the Common-wealth, &amp; it is a great weak|ning to the Society when &s;uch are removed. God &s;miles upon a People, when he rai&s;es up Serviceable men, and he Frowns upon them, when he &s;natches &s;uch away: many times it is a token of great anger when &s;uch men are removed, and they feel the bitter effects thereof many years after: when their Lives are lo&s;t, the Publick Society has a great lo&s;s: much of the Pro&s;perity of a People is buried in the Graves of U&s;eful men. <HI>Hezekiah.</HI> Death and <HI>Jo&s;iahs</HI> gave a deadly wound to the People of <HI>Judah,</HI> and was matter of great Mourning, 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 35.25. <HI>Jeremiah Lamented for Jo&s;iah.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> 1. Becau&s;e U&s;efull men are an Honour to the People. U&s;efull men are up|on that Account Honourable. Their U&s;e|fulne&s;s does command Reputation: they de|&s;erve re&s;pect and a good report upon that account. 1 <HI>Sam</HI> 9 6. <HI>He is an honourable man.</HI> 2 King. 5.1. <HI>He was honourable, becau&s;e by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria.</HI> And their honourablene&s;s does reflect
<PB N="6" REF="001146_0008_0FB08EF902D4C6F8">honour upon the People that they belong unto. As vile ba&s;e men are a reproach and di&s;grace to the People that they belong unto, men are a&s;hamed of them; &s;o honou|rable and u&s;efull men are an honour to the place. It was an honour to the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> that there were &s;o many Worthies in the Land in the dayes of <HI>David.</HI> It is a commendation of a People in other Coun|tries: U&s;efull men are an honour to all that are related to them. An U&s;efull man is an honour to his Parents, to his Children, to his Wife, to the place of his Nativity, to the place where he Lives: Honourable men make the place renowned where they dwell: it is an honour to a People to have choice men for Magi&s;trates and for Mini&s;ters; it rai&s;es the E&s;timation of a People in the Eye of the World. <HI>Zech.</HI> 10.4. <HI>Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppre&s;sour toge|gether;</HI> that is, &s;uch as &s;uppre&s;s and &s;ubdue their Enemies. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 87.5. <HI>Of Sion it &s;hall be &s;aid, this and that man was born in her.</HI> And when &s;uch men are removed the honour of a People is dimini&s;hed; their E&s;timation and renown does decay and wither away: their honour will &s;ink becau&s;e the foundation of it is taken away; tho&s;e that &s;upported it
<PB N="7" REF="001146_0009_0FB08EFFDC955A30">are removed: So they lo&s;e much of that fame and re&s;pect that they had.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> 2. Becau&s;e &s;uch men have a great intere&s;t in the affection of others. U&s;eful men di&s;cover Love: their qualifications are love|ly, and their Service draws forth Love: the Con&s;ciences of other men doe give a te&s;ti|mony unto them, and their hearts are Cap|tivated thereby. Partly from the te&s;timony of their Con&s;cience, and partly from a &s;ence of their own benefit, they have a Love to &s;uch men, and cannot but prize them; they love to &s;ee them, and love to conver&s;e with them. <HI>Job</HI> 29.11, 12. <HI>When the ear heard me then it ble&s;&s;ed me, and when the eye &s;aw me it gave witne&s;s unto me, becau&s;e I delivered the poor that cryed, the fatherle&s;s, and him that had none to help him.</HI> 1 Sam. 18.16. <HI>All I&s;rael and Judah loved David, becau&s;e he went out and came in before them.</HI> And becau&s;e they have an affection to them, it is an affliction to have them removed. If a man have a great affection to his Wife or his Child, it is the greater affliction to have them taken away. People are &s;mitten with grief and &s;orrow at the Death of &s;uch Per&s;ons, their hearts are wounded, their joy is turned into &s;orrow, it makes them goe with heavy hearts.
<PB N="8" REF="001146_0010_0FB08F012D24FDD8">2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.17. <HI>And David Lamented with this Lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his Son.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> 2. Becau&s;e &s;uch men doe procure a great deal of Good and prevent a great deal of Calamity. They are profitable to the Societies that they did belong to. So was <HI>Jehoiada,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 24.16. <HI>They buried him in the City of David among the Kings, becau&s;e he had done good in I&s;rael, both towards God, and towards his hou&s;e:</HI> When &s;uch men are Dead People many times want their Service, and &s;o are expo&s;ed to a great deal of Calamity, which by their pre&s;ence might have been prevented.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some by their Ju&s;tice do a great deal of good. They are careful to deliver them that are innocent. Many men would make a prey of others, and under pretences of Law devour the E&s;tates of other men, but while tho&s;e that are in Authority are men of Ju&s;tice, they will give no countenance to &s;uch things. Job 29.15, 16, 17. <HI>I was Eyes to the blind, and Feet was I to the lame, I was a Father to the poor, and the cau&s;e that I knew not I &s;earched out: and I brake the jaws of the wicked, and pluckt the &s;poil out of his teeth.</HI> So
<PB N="9" REF="001146_0011_0FB08F02B8FD3BC0">did <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 8.15. <HI>David Entented Judgment and Ju&s;tice to all his people:</HI> So <HI>Jo|&s;iah,</HI> Jer. 22.15. <HI>Did not thy Father do Judg|ment and Ju&s;tice.</HI> Such men will not be o|ver-ruled by affection, bribed by mens Mo|ney, or frighted with their greatne&s;s: <HI>Job</HI> 31.34. <HI>Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of Families terrifie me, that I kept &s;i|lence and went not out of the door.</HI> But after &s;uch men are dead, &s;ometimes in&s;tead of the Firr-tree comes up the thorn, and in&s;tead of the mirtle-tree comes up the briar; men get into Place of Power, that prevent Judgment, that incourage tho&s;e that are wicked. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 1.22, 23. <HI>Thy &s;ilver is become dro&s;s, thy wine mixed with water, thy Princes are, rebellions, and companions of thieves, every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards, they judge not the fatherle&s;s, neither doth the cau&s;e of the Widow come unto them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Some al&s;o by their skill, wi&s;dom and experience do a great deal of good. Some are well skilled in the Law and able to di|rect in difficult ca&s;es; they are men of abi|lity to di&s;cern between right and wrong, to &s;ee through ca&s;es that have intanglements and perplexity in them: This was that, that he prayed for, 1 King. 3.9. <HI>Give thy Ser|vant
<PB N="10" REF="001146_0012_0FB08F0752881848">an under&s;tanding heart, to judge thy Peo|ple, that I may di&s;cern between good and bad.</HI> They are men of prudence to find out pro|per means to advance the publick good; to find out expedients in difficult ca&s;es, and to di&s;cern what is to be done, to advance Re|ligion, to prevent mi&s;carriages, to advance peace, and compo&s;e differences. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12.32. <HI>Men that had under&s;tanding in the times to know what I&s;rael ought to do:</HI> By their expe|rience they are fitted to take right methods in doubtful ca&s;es. But many times when &s;uch men are dead, &s;uch may ari&s;e after them, as are ignorant and unskilful, ra&s;h and unexperienced men, who by their precipi|tate coun&s;els expo&s;e a Land to much mi&s;e|ry: So the Young men that were bred with <HI>Rehoboam</HI> gave fooli&s;h coun&s;el, and laid a foundation of la&s;ting &s;orrow to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> by their ra&s;hne&s;s, they opened a gap that let in a flood of mi&s;ery: 1 <HI>King.</HI> 12.10, 11.</P>
<P N="3">3. Some by their valour. Leading men, that have been men of valour, have done mighty Service to their Country: they have been in&s;truments under God to &s;ave it out of the hands of Enemies; and to inlarge the Dominions of the Country: Valour inables men to look dangers in the face; makes
<PB N="11" REF="001146_0013_0FB08F0DABCE7E28">them willing to run the hazard of their lives. <HI>Judg.</HI> 12.3. <HI>I put my life in my hand.</HI> They are in&s;truments to free the Land from Servitude and Bondage: a valiant Leader animates Souldiers, his Courage begets Cou|rage in others, and damps and di&s;courages Enemies, &s;uch Leaders are a terror to Ene|mies. <HI>Gen.</HI> 49.9. <HI>Judah is a lions whelp from the prey, my Son thou art gone up; he stooped down, be couched as a lien, and as an old lion, who &s;hall rou&s;e him up?</HI> In this way <HI>Barak</HI> and <HI>Gideon</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>David</HI> did abun|dance of good in their Generations, they vanqui&s;hed the Enemies of <HI>I&s;rael: From the blood of the Slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the &s;word of Saul returned not empty,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.22. But many times when &s;uch men are dead, for want of others of the &s;ame Spirit, people are harre&s;&s;ed and brought under hatches.</P>
<P N="4">4. Some by their Examples al&s;o do much good. They are exemplary in Religion, diligently practi&s;ing all the rules of it. So <HI>David</HI> was a diligent Wor&s;hipper of God; &s;o was <HI>Job,</HI> Job 1.1. <HI>One that feared God;</HI> they are examples of &s;obriety, of humility, of peaceablene&s;s, of cha&s;tity and charity;
<PB N="12" REF="001146_0014_0FB08F0EB9EC4AF8">and hereby others are led on to carry them|&s;elves well, many will follow the examples of principal men, and out of a re&s;pect to them, comply with their wayes, and &s;o get good habits: But &s;ometimes when &s;uch men are dead, there ari&s;e others in their room, that give bad examples, don't much counte|nance Religion, are pot companions, men of rude behaviour, tainted with corrupt practices, the&s;e examples will poi&s;on other men, and infect a Country, others will quickly learn &s;uch ways, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29.12. <HI>If a Ruler hearken to lies, all his Servants are wick|ed.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Some by their Honourablene&s;s al&s;o do abundance of good. They are men well re&s;pected, and upon that account capable to do abundance of Service; their propo&s;als are much hearkened to by tho&s;e that are in Supream Authority in the Country: If they make a motion for the good of the places where they live, they are readily hearken|ed unto, their judgment and fidelity is relied on; they can do a man a kindne&s;s with their word. The Prophet enquires of the woman of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> whether &s;he would be &s;po|ken for to the King or to the Captain of the Ho&s;t,</HI> 2 <HI>King.</HI> 4 13. He could have done her a kindne&s;s in that way: They can have
<PB N="13" REF="001146_0015_0FB08F1036148738">acce&s;s to tho&s;e in Chief Authority, when others cannot; their word will be regarded, when the word of others will not. So be|ing honourable, they bear much &s;way a|mong the people: In many ca&s;es their judgment is a law, they can ea&s;ily cru&s;h evil motions, and put a &s;top to corrupt and fact|ious de&s;igns; they can per&s;wade and draw people to that which is for their good: Others will be willing to plea&s;e, will be fearful of di&s;plea&s;ing, will have an high opinion of their judgment. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3.36. <HI>What&s;oever the King did plea&s;ed the people;</HI> but many times when &s;uch are dead, others that come after have no &s;uch influence; their advice and propo&s;als will not bear &s;way: others will &s;light them and thwart them: They that dared not to &s;peak a word in the days of <HI>Solomon,</HI> grew trouble|&s;ome after he was dead. 1 <HI>King.</HI> 12.3, 4.</P>

<P>It is a great Mercy when God rai&s;es up Serviceable Men among his People. Some|times it is otherwi&s;e among the People of God. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 51.18. <HI>There is none to guide her among the Sons which &s;he hath brought forth, neither is there any that taketh her by the hand,
<PB N="14" REF="001146_0016_0FB08F11DA644578">of all the Sons which &s;he hath brought up.</HI> But it is a great Mercy when he rai&s;es up Ser|viceable Men. <HI>Amos</HI> 2.11. <HI>I rai&s;ed up of your Sons for Prophets, and of your Young men for Nazarites</HI> I&s;a 1.26. <HI>I will re&s;tore thy Judges as at the fir&s;t, and thy Coun&s;ellors as at the be|ginning.</HI> Jer. 3 15. <HI>I will give them Pa&s;tors after my own heart, that &s;hall feed them with knowledge and under&s;tanding.</HI> This greatly helps forward the Welfare of a People: It is Gods work to rai&s;e up Serviceable men: He gives them their qualifications, natural and acquired; He gives them tho&s;e enjoy|ments that fit them for Publick place: He makes them Con&s;cientious, Religious and Godly men, and he be&s;tows actual advance|ment on them; He makes them to find favour that they may be put in place. And when he does thus, he greatly favours a People, for this makes way for the outward Pro&s;perity of a People, that they may live quietly and peaceably; and this makes way for their Spiritual Pro&s;perity, that they may be a Religious, Godly and well carriaged People; it is a &s;pecial means to make a People happy.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="15" REF="001146_0017_0FB08F1AC630D6C0">
1. This contributes more to the welfare of a people, then for their Rulers to know their duty. If Rulers be not fitted to be Serviceable, all things will run to ruine tho' they know their duty; if they know they &s;hould be ju&s;t, and give good examples, and &s;eek the publick Welfare, yet they may lye in the woful neglect of it. Some mens know|ledge does but make them more capable to do mi&s;chief; knowing men if they be not well di&s;po&s;ed, will do abundantly more hurt than good; if they be like toads, it will be little advantage that they have got pearls in their heads; it had been well for a Coun|try if &s;ome men had been born fools: <HI>Da|vid</HI> was more afraid of <HI>Ahitophel</HI> then of others. 2 Sam. 15.31. <HI>O Lord, I pray thee, turn the Coun&s;el of Ahitophel into fooli&s;h|ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This contributes a great deal more <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> good Laws. It is a great part of the care of Rulers to make good Laws: Good Laws in Civil, and &s;o in Criminal Ca&s;es, have their influence into the Welfare of a Country. That was one thing wherein the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were more happy than other people; they had good Laws pre&s;cri|bed unto them. <HI>What Nation is there &s;o great, that hath &s;tatutes and judgments &s;o righteous, as
<PB N="16" REF="001146_0018_0FB08F1CECE09620">all this Law which I &s;et before you this day.</HI> Deut 4.8. But good Laws will &s;ignifie little, if the men that are at Helm, be not fitted for Service. Laws are like a Sword, which if it be kept in a Scabbard will do no Execution The Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had very good Laws, Laws given them by God him&s;elf, yet many times were very mi&s;era|ble. Laws are like Phy&s;ick, which if it be not admini&s;tred, or duly admini&s;tred, does no &s;ervice. Laws as written may do a lit|tle good, but as Executed do far more: The Execution of the Law does rectify mi&s;car|riages pa&s;t, and prevent mi&s;carriages for the time to come. But good Laws will be as a no&s;e of wax, as the Papi&s;ts &s;ay of the Scripture, if <HI>Joel</HI> and <HI>Abiah</HI> have the ma|nagement of them. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 8.3. <HI>They fol|lowed after lucre, took bribes, and perverted judgment.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This will contribute more than Learn|ed Education. Several Young ones in the Country have liberal Education, and are furni&s;hed with Learning, whereby they are more inabled to get skill in the Law, and to di&s;cover the fraud in fal&s;e pleas: But this will not make the Country happy, if they have not a Spirit to do Service. Men of
<PB N="17" REF="001146_0019_0FB08F1E62E75D20">Learned Education through other unfitne&s;&s;es may expo&s;e a People to great Calamity. Learned Education is an help both to Civi|lity and Piety, but it cannot effect either. Some Learned men had need to Learn &s;ome|what more, before ever they will do any great matter, in order to the happine&s;s of the Land. The <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> had Learned Educations, yet helped forward the ruine of the <HI>Jews:</HI> Men that are brought up at the feet of <HI>Gemaliel,</HI> have need (as <HI>Paul</HI>) to &s;ee a light from Heaven.</P>

<P>Such men as are U&s;efull and Serviceable &s;hould not be de&s;pi&s;ed. There is an evil Spirit prevailing in &s;ome, and they are ready under one pretence or another to de&s;pi&s;e U&s;efull men: as <HI>Michal</HI> de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>David</HI> in her heart. There be many that honour them, yet there be others that un|dervalue them. It is the Spirit of <HI>men of Belial to de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10.27. But if men be Serviceable men, they are great Ble&s;&s;ings, and it is a Frown when God re|moves them, and tho&s;e men are blame worthy that do de&s;pi&s;e them, whatever notion they do it under.</P>

1. Some do it under a notion, that they have &s;uch and &s;uch Infirmities. But if we grant that they have, (though &s;ome men count tho&s;e things faults and infirmities that are none;) yet they may not be de&s;pi&s;ed. <HI>Humanum e&s;t Errare,</HI> where &s;hall we find men without infirmities? If <HI>David</HI> acted ra&s;hly in the matter of <HI>Mephibo&s;heth,</HI> mu&s;t he be de&s;pi&s;ed? If <HI>A&s;a</HI> did not take away the high places, mu&s;t he be de&s;pi&s;ed?

If <HI>Hezekiah's</HI> heart were lifted up when the Amba&s;&s;adours came from <HI>Babylon,</HI> mu&s;t he be de&s;pi&s;ed? If it were a precipitate thing for <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> to take the field again&s;t the King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> mu&s;t he be de&s;pi&s;ed? Men at the be&s;t are but men compa&s;&s;ed about with infirmities. God honours men though they have infirmities. 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 19 3. <HI>Neverthele&s;s there are good things found in thee.</HI> God hears the Prayers of his People, though they have infirmities. <HI>James</HI> 5.17. <HI>Elias was a man &s;ubject to like pa&s;&s;ions as we are, and he Prayed earne&s;tly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth, by the &s;pace of three years and &s;ix months.</HI> Their infirmities are a di&s;honour unto them, but they are to be honoured notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="19" REF="001146_0021_0FB08F281471A868">their infirmities: infirmities are blemi&s;hes, but yet <HI>They</HI> may be prai&s;e worthy for all them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some do it under a notion that we have plenty of men &s;it for choice Service. That we want rather Offices for men than men for Offices: the Country it full of able men. It is very fit that we &s;hould take notice of what there is of that nature with thankfulne&s;s: But indeed many things mu&s;t meet together to make men meet for &s;ome Offices. He that may do God and his Country good Service, in a lower Station, may be altogether unfit for an higher Sta|tion. The Country runs low enough in men. We have nothing to boa&s;t of but have cau&s;e to be humbled before God, that there be &s;o few every way accompli&s;hed for Publick Service; it is a &s;mall matter in &s;uch a Country as this to make a Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion. Some that carry pretty well are not like them that went before them. 2 <HI>King.</HI> 14 3. <HI>He did that which was right in the &s;ight of the Lord, but not like David his Father.</HI> When the foundation of the Se|cond Temple was laid, the young men re|joyced, but the old men wept.</P>

3. Some do it under a notion that they might have been more Serviceable. It is acknowledged that they do a pretty deal of Service; but men de&s;pi&s;e them becau&s;e they had Opportunity and Advantage to have done more. But if the thing be true, yet they are to be honoured on the account of what they have done: if they had had more zeal and indu&s;try and of a Publick Spirit, it had been better: yet po&s;&s;ibly they have been great ble&s;&s;ings: if through mi&s;take they did not rectify &s;ome abu&s;es, if tempta|tion did prevail with them, to be more in|dulgent than they &s;hould, yet they are not to be de&s;pi&s;ed. Where is the man that might not have done more good, than he has done? Neither <HI>A&s;a's</HI> nor <HI>Jeho&s;haphats,</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah's</HI> Reformation were &s;o perfect as <HI>Jo&s;iahs,</HI> yet they were men greatly to be honoured.</P>
<P N="4">4. Some do it under a notion that they were Ancient. They were grown old, and had le&s;s activity than before, that their Judgment and Memory began to fail them. But we find in Scripture the <HI>Ancient and the Honourable</HI> joyned together, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 9.15. An|cient men are to be honoured on the account
<PB N="21" REF="001146_0023_0FB08F2B26882E78">of what they have done. <HI>The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Prov.</HI> 16.31. Ancient men are to be honoured upon the account of their Prudence and Experience; the <HI>Prudent and the Ancient</HI> are joyned together in the Text. <HI>Job</HI> 12.12. <HI>With the Ancient is Wi&s;dom.</HI> The Ancient men that &s;tood before <HI>Solomon,</HI> might be thought timerous and inclining to dotage by <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> but it would have been well for him, if he had followed their advice: They were fitter to give coun&s;el than he was to receive it.</P>

<HEAD>USE. III. Of HUMILIATION.</HEAD>
<P>That God is removing Serviceable man from among us. We have cau&s;e to look upon this a great frown from God: be&s;ide &s;everal others that God has taken away in former times, He has more lately removed his Servant <HI>DANFORTH,</HI> and &s;ince that his Servant <HI>STOUGHTON,</HI> and now another Honourable man is taken away: a great man is fallen this is day in our <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and it becomes us to Mourn and La|ment under this di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="22" REF="001146_0024_0FB08F2E44BCB520">
1. <HI>Ob&s;erve,</HI> That God has removed one that has been along while Serviceable. That has been improved about Publick Service for above <HI>Fifty Years:</HI> he has been Serviceable unto the Country in general, and in &s;pecial among our &s;elves. He hath had the princi|pal management of our Military Affairs, and our Civil Affairs: and laboured much in the &s;etling of mo&s;t of our Plantations, has managed things with Indu&s;try, Prudence and Moderation. He hath been careful in time of War, and as there has been occa&s;ion, he has been a Peace Maker among us, and helpfull in compo&s;ing of differences: he has di&s;countenanced Rude and Vicious Per|&s;ons, bearing his Te&s;timony again&s;t them.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is to be feared that we &s;hall feel the &s;orrowful effects of his removal a long while. Some times when Parents dye, Children don't at pre&s;ent &s;o much feel the want of them, as they do afterwards. We may have occa&s;ion afterwards to remember with &s;or|row that we had &s;uch an One among us: Though we have other U&s;eful men, yet there may ari&s;e &s;uch Ca&s;es wherein there may be great need of his conduct and help. He was honourable and had great influence
<PB N="23" REF="001146_0025_0FB08F35F08D1B90">upon men in Authority abroad, and upon the People at home, and had more experi|ence by far, than any other among us.</P>
<P N="3">3. This comes in Conjunction with other Sorrows. We are under an expectation of Trouble from Enemies; and are under the heavy Hand of God, in the Di&s;ea&s;es that prevail in the Land. The Afflictions of our principal Town are very great, many Fami|lies are Mourning over their Dead. God is pleading his Controver&s;y with us in that Terrible Mortality, and in &s;uch a day as this, God has added this Affliction to ag|gravate our Sorrow; if it had come alone, it had been heavy, but now we have one wave and billow upon another. Our Af|flictions are like <HI>Jobs,</HI> one comes upon the neck of another. There was great anger before, but God &s;ees cau&s;e to make this ad|dition to it: Our Cup was bitter before, this makes it more bitter: if it had come in a time of Pro&s;perity, it had been &s;ad, but being in a time of Adver&s;ity, it is more &s;ad. It is the manner of God many times to comfort his People in their Affliction, but he is adding to the grief of them that were wounded before.</P>

2. That you be good examples to the people.

It is a great wrong to a|ny people to have vicious men Set over them; the Setting up of vicious men in places of Power, opens a door to abun|dance of iniquity; they will mightily in|crea&s;e the Degeneracy of the Land. Let men learn to govern them&s;elves, before they be &s;et to govern others: Honour is not &s;eemly for a fool. Such men have more need to be ruled than to rule.
