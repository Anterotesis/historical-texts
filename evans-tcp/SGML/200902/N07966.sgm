<HEAD>AN HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF Colonel BOUQUET'S Expedition, Again&s;t the <HI>Ohio</HI> Indians in the Year 1764.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the preceeding introduction, &s;ome account hath been given of the &s;udden, treacherous and unprovok'd attack, made by the Indians upon the frontiers of Penn&s;ylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, &s;oon after the publication of the general Peace, at a time when we were but ju&s;t begin|ing to re&s;pire from our former calamities, and looked for an approach of quiet on every &s;ide. The principal tran&s;actions of the cam|paign 1763 have likewi&s;e been briefly recapitulated, and the reader informed by what means the editor became po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the valuable papers, which have enabled him to bring the hi&s;tory of this Indian war to a conclu&s;ion, and fur|ni&s;hed the materials of the following &s;heets.</P>
<P>COLONEL BOUQUET, as before mentioned, not having a &s;ufficient number of troops to garri&s;on the different po&s;ts, under his command, and at the &s;ame time to cro&s;s the Ohio and take advantage of the dejection into which he had thrown the enemy, by the defeat at Bu&s;hy-Run, was obliged to re&s;train his
<PB N="2" REF="010167_0002_0F7D44A83467CD50">
operations to the &s;upplying the forts with provi&s;ions, ammunition and other nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>IN the execution of this &s;ervice, he received no annoyance from the enemy, for they now &s;aw them&s;elves not only forced to give up their de&s;igns again&s;t FORT-PITT; but, retreating beyond the Ohio, they de&s;erted their former towns, and abandoned all the country between Pre&s;que-I&s;le and Sandu&s;ki; not thinking them&s;elves &s;afe till they arrived at Mu&s;kingam.</P>
<P>HERE they began to form new &s;ettlements, and remained quiet during the winter. But, in the mean time, having &s;upplied them&s;elves with powder &amp;c. from the French traders, (and now flattering them&s;elves that the great di&s;tance of their &s;ettlements would render them inacce&s;&s;ible to our troops) the en&s;uing &s;pring 1764 pre&s;ented the&s;e &s;avage enemies afre&s;h on our frontiers; ravaging and murdering with their u&s;ual barbarity.</P>
<P>TO cha&s;ti&s;e them for their perfidy, General Gage re&s;olved to attack them on two different &s;ides, and to force them from our frontiers; by carrying the war into the heart of their own country. With this view, he de&s;tined a corps of troops to proceed under Col. Brad&s;treet, to act again&s;t the Wiandots, Ottawas, Chip|was and other nations, living upon or near the lakes; while another corps, under the command of Col. Bouquet &s;hould attack the Delawares, Shawa|ne&s;e, Mingoes, Mohickons, and other nations, between the Ohio and the lakes.</P>
<P>THESE two corps were to act in concert; and as that of Col. Brad&s;treet could be ready much &s;ooner than the other, he was to proceed to Detroit, Michili|mackinac and other places. On his return, he was to encamp and remain at Sandu&s;ki, to awe, by that po&s;ition, the numerous tribes of we&s;tern Indians, &s;o as to prevent their &s;ending any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Ohio Indians, while Colonel Bouquet &s;hould execute his plan of attacking them in the heart of their &s;ettle|ments.</P>
<P>COL. BOUQUET'S expedition was to proceed altogether by land, and was on that account attended with great difficulties. His men were to penetrate thro'
<PB N="3" REF="010167_0003_0F7D44A942EF7ED0">
a continued depth of woods, and a &s;avage unexplor'd country; without roads, without po&s;ts, and without a retreat if they failed of &s;ucce&s;s. When once en|gaged in the&s;e de&s;erts, they had no <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, nor any kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to ex|pect. Every thing was to be carried with them &mdash; their ammunition, baggage, tools, &s;tores, and provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for the troops during the whole expedi|tion. And be&s;ides, they were liable to many embarra&s;ments, and difficulties which no prudence could fore&s;ee, &s;carce any caution prevent; &s;o that, in this ac+count, &s;undry things, which, in the u&s;ual method of conducting military opera|tions might not be thought worthy of a detail, may neverthele&s;s be found high|ly &s;erviceable to tho&s;e who may afterwards be employed in this &s;pecies of war, which is new to Europeans, who mu&s;t &s;ubmit to be in&s;tructed in it by experi|ence, and in many articles even by the &s;avages them&s;elves.</P>
<P>PART of the 42d and 60th regiments were ordered on this expedi|tion, and were to be joined by two hundred friendly Indians, and the troops required of Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania. The Indians never came, and the Virginians pleaded their inability to rai&s;e men, having already in pay a|bout 700 militia for the defence of their own frontier. In Penn&s;ylvania, a bill for rai&s;ing 1000 men was pa&s;&s;ed May 30th; but, with the utmo&s;t dili|gence that could be u&s;ed, the number could not be compleated till the begin|ing of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>ON the 5th of that month, the men being a&s;&s;embled at Carli&s;le, one hund|red and eighteen miles to the we&s;tward of Philadelphia, Governor Penn, who had accompanied Col. Bouquet to that place, acquainted the two Penn&s;ylva|nia battalions with the nece&s;&s;ity we were laid under of cha&s;ti&s;ing the Indians <Q>for their repeated and unprovoked barbarities on the inhabitants of the pro|vince; a ju&s;t re&s;entment of which, added to a remembrance of the loyalty and courage of our provincial troops on former occa&s;ions, he did not doubt, would animate them to do honor to their country; and that they could not but hope to be crown'd with &s;ucce&s;s, as they were to be united with the &s;ame regular troops, and under the &s;ame able commander, who had by them|&s;elves, on that very day, the memorable 5th of Augu&s;t in the preceeding
<PB N="4" REF="010167_0004_0F7D44A9AE30FF38">
year, &s;u&s;tained the repeated attacks of the &s;avages, and obtained a compleat victory over them.</Q>&mdash;He al&s;o reminded them <Q>of the examplary puni&s;hments that would be inflicted on the grievous crime of de&s;ertion, if any of them were capable of &s;o far forgetting their &s;olemn oath and duty to their king and country, as to be involved in it.</Q></P>
<P>COL. BOUQUET then a&s;&s;umed the command of the regular and provincial troops; and the four following days were &s;pent in the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for their march; the Colonel giving the mo&s;t expre&s;s orders to the officers and men to ob&s;erve &s;trict di&s;cipline, and not to commit the lea&s;t violation of the civil rights or peace of the inhabitants.&mdash;He, at the &s;ame time, made the mo&s;t prudent regulations for a &s;afe and commodious carriage of the baggage, taking care to rid him&s;elf of all unnece&s;&s;ary incumbrances.</P>
<P>THE 13th of Augu&s;t this &s;mall army got to Fort Loudoun; but notwith|&s;tanding all the precautions taken to prevent de&s;ertion, the Penn&s;ylvania troops were now reduced to about 700 men. The Colonel was therefore un|der a nece&s;&s;ity to apply to the government of that province to enable him to compleat their number to the full complement; which was generou&s;ly grant|ed by a re&s;olve of the Governor and Commi&s;&s;ioners Augu&s;t 16th; and the army advancing now beyond the &s;ettled parts of Penn&s;ylvania, he made appli|cation to the colony of Virginia, where (under the countenance of Go|vernor Fauquier) the men wanted were &s;oon rai&s;ed, and joined the army at Pitt&s;burg, about the latter end of September.</P>
<P>NOTHING material happened in their march, from Fort Loudoun to Fort Pitt, (formerly Fort Du Que&s;ne) on the Ohio, three hundred and twenty miles we&s;t from Philadelphia; at which place Col. Bouquet arrived the 17th, September.</P>
<P>DURING this interval, &s;everal large convoys were forwarded under &s;trong e&s;corts; and tho' the enemy continued their ravages all that time on the fron|tiers,
<PB N="5" REF="010167_0005_0F7D44AE0C6533D8">
they dur&s;t not attack any of tho&s;e convoys, which all arrived &s;afe at Fort Pitt.</P>
<P>WHILE Col. Bouquet was at Fort Loudoun, he received di&s;patches by ex|pre&s;s from Col. Brad&s;treet, dated from Pre&s;que-I&s;le Augu&s;t 14th, acquaint|ing him that he (Col. Brad&s;treet,) had concluded a peace with the Delawares and Shawane&s;e; but Col. Bouquet perceiving clearly that they were not &s;in|cere in their intentions, as they continued their murders and depredations, he determined to pro&s;ecute his plan without remi&s;&s;ion, till he &s;hould receive fur|ther in&s;tructions from General Gage; who, upon the &s;ame principles, refu&s;ed to ratify the treaty, and renewed his orders to both armies to attack the enemy.</P>
<P>ABOUT the time of Col. Bouquet's arrival at Fort Pitt, ten Indians appeared on the north &s;ide of the Ohio, de&s;iring a conference; which &s;tratagem the &s;avages had made u&s;e of before, to obtain intelligence of our numbers and in|tentions. Three of the party con&s;ented, tho' with apparent reluctance, to come over to the Fort; and as they could give no &s;atisfactory rea&s;on for their vi&s;it, they were detained as &s;pies, and their a&s;&s;ociates fled back to their towns.</P>
<P>ON the 20th of Sept. Col. Bouquet &s;ent one of the above three Indians after them with a me&s;&s;age, in &s;ub&s;tance as follows&mdash;<Q>I have received an account from Col. Brad&s;treet that your nations had begg'd for peace, which he had con&s;ented to grant, upon a&s;&s;urance that you had recalled all your warriors from our frontiers; and in con&s;equence thereof, I would not have proceed|ed again&s;t your towns, if I had not heard that, in open violation of your en|gagements, you have &s;ince murdered &s;everal of our people.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AS &s;oon as the re&s;t of the army joins me, which I expect immediately, I was therefore determined to have attacked you, as a people who&s;e promi&s;es can no more be relied on. But I will put it once more in your power to &s;ave your|&s;elves and your families from total de&s;truction, by giving us &s;atisfaction for the ho&s;tilities committed again&s;t us. And fir&s;t you are to leave the path
<PB N="6" REF="010167_0006_0F7D44AF8BAE2C60">
open for my expre&s;&s;es from hence to Detroit; and as I am now to &s;end two men with di&s;patches to Col. Brad&s;treet who commands on the lakes, I de&s;ire to know whether you will &s;end two of your people with them to bring them &s;afe back with an an&s;wer? and if they receive any injury either in going or coming, or if the letters are taken from them, I will immediately put the Indians now in my power to death, and will &s;hew no mercy for the future to any of your nations that &s;hall fall into my hands. I allow you ten days to have my letters delivered at Detroit, and ten days to bring me back an an&s;wer.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>HE added <Q>that he had lately had it in his power, while they remained on the other &s;ide of the river, to have put their whole party to death, which puni&s;hment they had de&s;erved by their former treachery; and that if they did not improve the clemency now offered to them, by returning back as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible with all their pri&s;oners, they might expect to feel the full weight of a ju&s;t vengeance and re&s;entment.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>WE have been the more particular in our account of this fir&s;t tran&s;action with the Indians; becau&s;e the Colonel's firm and determined conduct in open|ing the campaign, had happy effects in the pro&s;ecution of it, and &s;hews by what methods the&s;e faithle&s;s &s;avages are to be be&s;t reduced to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>ON the 1&s;t of October, two of the Six Nation tribes, an Onondago and Oneida Indian, came to Fort Pitt, and under colour of our ancient friend&s;hip with them, and their pretended regard to the Engli&s;h, endeavoured to di&s;|&s;uade the Colonel from proceeding with the army. They told him that his force was not &s;ufficient to with&s;tand the power of the numerous nations through who&s;e countries he was to pa&s;s, and a&s;&s;ured him that if he would wait a little, they would all come and make peace with him; at the &s;ame time recommending it particularly to him to &s;end back the two Indians detained as &s;pies. The&s;e little arts being clearly made u&s;e of to &s;pin out the &s;ea&s;on till the approach of winter &s;hould render it impo&s;&s;ible to proceed, they made but little impre&s;&s;ion. He told them that he could not depend on the pro|mi&s;es
<PB N="7" REF="010167_0007_0F7D44B024A38FF8">
of the Delawares and Shawane&s;e; and was determined to proceed to Tu&s;carowas, where, if they had any thing to &s;ay, he would hear them.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, he was u&s;ing the utmo&s;t diligence to prepare for his march, and was obliged to enforce the &s;evere&s;t di&s;cipline. One woman be|longing to each corps, and two nur&s;es for the general ho&s;pital, were all that were permitted to follow the army. The other women in the camp, and tho&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary in the garri&s;on, were ordered immediately down the country into the &s;ettlements. Two &s;oldiers were &s;hot for de&s;ertion; an example which became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppre&s;s a crime which, in &s;uch an expedition, would have been attended with fatal con&s;equences, by weakening an army already too &s;mall.</P>
<P>COL. BOUQUET, having at length, with great difficulty, collected his troops, formed his magazines, and provided for the &s;afety of the po&s;ts he was to leave behind him, was ready on the 2d of October to proceed from Fort Pitt, with about 1500 men, including drivers and other nece&s;&s;ary followers of the army.</P>
<P>AS a ju&s;t idea of the conduct of this expedition, and the great caution tak|en to prevent &s;urprize, will be be&s;t obtained from the ORDER OF MARCH, we &s;hall here in&s;ert it, with a Copper Plate for the illu&s;tration of it, and an ac|curate Draught, taken from actual &s;urveys, of the road and adjacent country, through which the army pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE Colonel, expre&s;&s;ing the greate&s;t confidence in the bravery of the troops, told them, <Q>he did not doubt but this war would &s;oon be ended, under God, to their own honor, and the future &s;afety of their country, provided the men were &s;trictly obedient to orders, and guarded again&s;t the &s;urprizes and &s;udden attacks of a treacherous enemy, who never dared to face Briti&s;h troops in an open field; that the di&s;tance of the enemy's towns, and the clearing roads to them, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily require a con&s;iderable time; that the troops in tho&s;e de&s;erts, had no other &s;upplies to expect but the ammu|nition
<PB N="8" REF="010167_0008_0F7D44B073559618">
and provi&s;ions they carried with them; and that therefore the utmo&s;t care and frugality would be nece&s;&s;ary in the u&s;e of them.</Q> He publi&s;hed the &s;evere&s;t penalties again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould be found guilty of &s;tealing or embezzling any part of them, and ordered his March in the following manner.&mdash;</P>
<P>A corps of Virginia <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were the men rai&s;ed in Virginia to compleat the Penn&s;ylvania troops, and were in the pay of the la&s;t mentioned province.</NOTE> volunteers advanced before the whole; detaching three &s;couting parties. One of them, furni&s;hed with a guide, marched in the center path, which the army was to follow. The other two extended them|&s;elves in a line a-brea&s;t, on the right and left of the afore&s;aid party, to reco|noitre the woods.</P>
<P>UNDER cover of this corps, the ax-men, con&s;i&s;ting of all the artificers, and two companies of light infantry, followed in three divi&s;ions, under the di|rection of the chief engineer, to clear three different paths, in which the the troops and the convoy followed, viz.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE front-face of the &s;quare, compo&s;ed of part of the 42d. regiment, marched in a column, two deep, in the center path.</P>
<P>THE right face of the &s;quare, compo&s;ed of the remainder of the 42d. and of the 60th regiment, marched in a &s;ingle file in the right hand path.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t battalion of Penn&s;ylvanians compo&s;ed the left face, marching in like manner in the path to the left of the center.</P>
<P>THE corps de re&s;erve, compo&s;ed of two platoons of grenadiers, followed the right and left faces of the &s;quare.</P>
<P>THE 2d battalion of Penn&s;ylvanians formed the rear face of the &s;quare, and followed the corps de re&s;erve, each in a &s;ingle file, on the right and left
<PB N="9" REF="010167_0009_0F7D44B12EA06E90">
hand paths; all the&s;e troops covering the convoy, which moved in the center path.</P>
<P>A party of light hor&s;e-men marched behind the rear-face of the &s;quare, followed by another corps of Virginia volunteers, forming the rear-guard.</P>
<P>THE Penn&s;ylvania volunteers, dividing them&s;elves equally, and marching in a &s;ingle file, at a proper di&s;tance, flanked the right and left faces of the &s;quare.</P>
<P>THIS was the general order of March. Nor was le&s;s attention paid to particular matters of a &s;ubordinate nature. The ammunition and tools were placed in the rear of the fir&s;t column, or front face of the &s;quare, followed by the officer's baggage, and tents. The oxen and &s;heep came after the bag|gage, in &s;eparate droves, properly guarded. The provi&s;ions came next to the baggage, in four divi&s;ions, or brigades of pack-hor&s;es, each conducted by a hor&s;e ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE troops were ordered to ob&s;erve the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence, and the men to march at two yards di&s;tance from one another. When the line or any part of it halted, the whole were to face outwards; and if attacked on their march, they were to halt immediately, ready to form the &s;quare when ordered. The light hor&s;e were then to march into the &s;quare, with the cat|tle, provi&s;ions, ammunition and baggage. Proper di&s;po&s;itions were likewi&s;e made in ca&s;e of an attack in the night; and for encampments, guards, communications between the centries, &s;ignals, and the like.</P>
<P>THINGS being thus &s;ettled, the army decamped from Fort-Pitt on Wed|ne&s;day October 3d, and marched about one mile and an half over a rich level country, with &s;tately timber, to camp No. 2. a &s;trong piece of ground, plea&s;antly &s;ituated, with plenty of water and food for cattle.</P>
<P>THURSDAY October 4th, having proceeded about two miles, they came to the Ohio, at the beginning of the narrows, and from thence followed the cour&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="010167_0010_0F7D44B1F2788C28">
of the river along a flat gravelly beech, about &s;ix miles and a quarter; with two i&s;lands on their left, the lowermo&s;t about &s;ix miles long, with a ri&s;ing ground running acro&s;s, and gently &s;loping on both &s;ides to its banks, which are high and upright. At the lower end of this i&s;land, the army left the river, marching thro' good land, broken with &s;mall hollows to camp No. 3; this day's march being nine miles and a quarter.&mdash;</P>
<P>FRIDAY October 5th. In this day's march, the army pa&s;s'd thro' Loggs-town, &s;ituated &s;eventeen miles and an half, fifty &s;even perches, by the path, from Fort-Pitt. This place was noted before the la&s;t war for the great trade carried on there by the Engli&s;h and French; but its inhabitants, the Shawa|ne&s;e and Delawares, abandoned it in the year 1750. The lower town extended about &s;ixty perches over a rich bottom to the foot of a low &s;teep ridge, on the &s;ummit of which, near the declivity, &s;tood the upper town, commanding a mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pect over the lower, and quite acro&s;s the Ohio, which is a|bout five hundred yards wide here, and by its maje&s;tic ea&s;y current adds much to the beauty of the place. Proceeding beyond Loggs-town, thro' a fine country, inter&s;per&s;ed with hills and rich valleys, watered by many rivu|lets, and covered with &s;tately timber, they came to camp No. 4; on a level piece of ground, with a thicket in the rear, a &s;mall precipice round the front, with a run of water at the foot, and good food for cattle. This day's march was nine miles, one half, and fifty three perches.</P>
<P>SATURDAY October 6th, at about three miles di&s;tance from this camp, they came again to the Ohio, pur&s;uing its cour&s;e half a mile farther, and then turn|ing off, over a &s;teep ridge, they cro&s;s'd big Beaver-creek, which is twen|ty perches wide, the ford &s;tony and pretty deep. It runs thro' a rich vale, with a pretty &s;trong current, its banks high, the upland adjoining it very good, the timber tall and young.&mdash;About a mile below its confluence with the Ohio, &s;tood formerly a large town, on a &s;teep bank, built by the French of &s;quare logs, with &s;tone chimneys, for &s;ome of the Shawane&s;e, Delaware and Mingo tribes, who abandoned it in the year 1758, when the French de&s;erted Fort Du Que&s;ne. Near the fording of Beaver-creek al&s;o &s;tood about &s;even
<PB N="11" REF="010167_0011_0F7D44B2B8134538">
hou&s;es, which were de&s;erted and de&s;troyed by the Indians, after their defeat at Bu&s;hy-run, when they for&s;ook all their remaining &s;ettlements in this part of the country, as has been mentioned above.</P>
<P>ABOUT two miles before the army came to Beaver-creek, one of our people who had been made pri&s;oner by &s;ix Delawares about a week before, near Fort Bedford, having made his e&s;cape from them, came and informed the Colonel that the&s;e Indians had the day before fallen in with the army, but kept them|&s;elves concealed, being &s;urprized at our numbers. Two miles beyond Beaver-creek, by two &s;mall &s;prings, was &s;een the &s;cull of a child, that had been fixed on a pole by the Indians. The Tracts of 15 Indians were this day di&s;covered. The camp No. 5 is &s;even miles one quarter and fifty &s;even perches from big Beaver-creek; the whole march of this day being about twelve miles.</P>
<P>SUNDAY 7th October, pa&s;&s;ing a high ridge, they had a fine pro&s;pect of an exten&s;ive country to the right, which in general appeared level, with a|bundance of tall timber. The camp No. 6 lies at the foot of a &s;teep de&s;cent, in a rich valley, on a &s;trong ground, three &s;ides thereof &s;urrounded by a hollow, and on the fourth &s;ide a &s;mall hill, which was occupied by a detached guard. This day's march was &s;ix miles &s;ixty five perches.</P>
<P>MONDAY 8th October, the army cro&s;s'd little Beaver-creek, and one of its branches. This creek is eight perches wide, with a good ford, the coun|try about it inter&s;per&s;ed with hills, rivulets and rich valleys, like that de&s;crib|ed above. Camp No. 7 lies by a &s;mall run on the &s;ide of a hill, commanding the ground about it, and is di&s;tant eleven miles one quarter and forty nine per|ches from the la&s;t encampment.</P>
<P>TUESDAY October 9th. In this day's march, the path divided into two branches, that to the &s;outhwe&s;t leading to the lower towns upon the Mu&s;king|ham. In the forks of the path &s;tand &s;everal trees painted by the Indians, in a hieroglyphic manner, denoting the number of wars in which they have been en|gag'd, and the particulars of their &s;ucce&s;s in pri&s;oners and &s;calps. The camp
<PB N="12" REF="010167_0012_0F7D44B388E22798">
No. 8. lies on a run, and level piece of ground, with Yellow-creek clo&s;e on the left, and a ri&s;ing ground near the rear of the right face. The path after the army left the forks was &s;o bru&s;hy and entangled, that they were obliged to cut all the way before them, and al&s;o to lay &s;everal bridges, in order to make it pa&s;&s;able for the hor&s;es; &s;o that this day they proceeded only five miles, three quarters and &s;eventy perches.</P>
<P>WEDNESDAY 10th. Marched one mile with Yellow-creek on the left at a &s;mall di&s;tance all the way, and cro&s;&s;ed it at a good ford fifty feet wide; pro|ceeding thro' an alternate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;mall hills and rich vales, finely wa|tered with rivulets, to camp No. 9. &s;even miles and &s;ixty perches in the whole.</P>
<P>THURSDAY 11th. Cro&s;s'd a branch of Mu&s;kingham river about fifty feet wide, the country much the &s;ame as that de&s;cribed above, di&s;covering a good deal of free &s;tone. The camp No. 10. had this branch of the river parallel to its left face, and lies ten miles one quarter and forty perches from the for|mer encampment.</P>
<P>FRIDAY 12th. Keeping the afore&s;aid creek on their left, they marched thro' much fine land, watered with &s;mall rivers and &s;prings; proceeding likewi&s;e thro' &s;everal &s;avannah's or cleared &s;pots, which are by nature extremely beau|tiful; the &s;econd which they pa&s;&s;ed being, in particular, one continued plain of near two miles, with a fine ri&s;ing ground forming a &s;emicircle round the right hand &s;ide, and a plea&s;ant &s;tream of water at about a quarter of a mile di&s;|tant on the left. The camp No. 11. has the abovementioned branch of Mu&s;|kingham on the left, and is di&s;tant ten miles and three quarters from the la&s;t encampment.</P>
<P>SATURDAY 13th. Cro&s;s'd Nemen&s;hehelas-creek, about fifty feet wide, a little above where it empties it&s;elf into the afore&s;aid branch of Mu&s;kingham, having in their way a plea&s;ant pro&s;pect over a large plain, for near two miles on the left. A little further, they came to another &s;mall river which they
<PB N="13" REF="010167_0013_0F7D44B43134E0C8">
cro&s;s'd about fifty perches above where it empties into the &s;aid branch of Mu&s;kingham. Here a high ridge on the right, and the creek clo&s;e on the left, form a narrow defile about &s;eventy perches long. Pa&s;&s;ing afterwards over a very rich bottom, they came to the main branch of Mu&s;kingham, about &s;eventy yards wide, with a good ford. A little below and above the forks of this river is Tu&s;carowas, a place exceedingly beautiful by &s;ituation, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> rich on both &s;ides of the river; the country on the northwe&s;t &s;ide being <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> entire level plain, upwards of five miles in circumference. From the ruined hou&s;es appearing here, the Indians who inhabited the place and are now with the Delawares, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have had about one hundred and and fifty warriors. This camp No. 12. is di&s;tant eight miles nineteen per|ches from the former.</P>
<P>SUNDAY 14th. The army remained in camp; and two men who had been di&s;patched by Col. Bouquet from Fort-Pitt, with letters for Col. Brad&s;treet, returned and reported&mdash;"That, within a few miles of this place, they had been made pri&s;oners by the Delawares, and carried to one of their towns &s;ixteen miles from hence, where they were kept, till the &s;avages, knowing of the arrival of the army here, &s;et them at liberty, ordering them to acquaint the Colonel that the head men of the Delawares and Shawane&s;e were coming as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to treat of peace with him."</P>
<P>MONDAY 15th. The army moved two miles forty perches further down the Mu&s;kingham to camp No. 13, &s;ituated on a very high bank, with the river at the foot of it, which is upwards of 100 yards wide at this place, with a fine level country at &s;ome di&s;tance from its banks, producing &s;tately timber, free from underwood, and plenty of food for cattle.</P>
<P>THE day following, &s;ix Indians came to inform the Colonel that all their chiefs were a&s;&s;embled about eight miles from the camp, and were ready to treat with him of peace, which they were earne&s;tly de&s;irous of obtaining. He returned for an&s;wer that he would meet them the next day in a bower at &s;ome
<PB N="14" REF="010167_0014_0F7D44B5008462A0">
di&s;tance from the camp. In the mean time, he ordered a &s;mall &s;tockaded &s;ort to be built to depo&s;it provi&s;ions for the u&s;e of the troops on their return; and to lighten the convoy.</P>
<P>AS &s;everal large bodies of Indians were now within a few miles of the camp, who&s;e former in&s;tances of treachery, altho' they now declared they came for peace, made it prudent to tru&s;t nothing to their intentions, the &s;tricte&s;t orders were repeated to prevent a &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>WEDNESDAY 17th. The Colonel, with mo&s;t of the regular troops, Virginia volunteers and light hor&s;e, marched from the camp to the bower erected for the congre&s;s. And &s;oon after the troops were &s;tationed, &s;o as to appear to the be&s;t advantage, the Indians arrived, and were conducted to the bower. Be|ing &s;eated, they began, in a &s;hort time, to &s;moak their pipe or calumet; a|agreable to their cu&s;tom. This ceremony being over, their &s;peakers laid down their pipes, and opened their pouches, wherein were their &s;trings and belts of wampum. The Indians pre&s;ent were, <LIST>
<ITEM>SENECAS. Kiya&s;huta, chief with 15 warriors.</ITEM>
<ITEM>DELAWARES. Cu&s;taloga, chief of the Wolfe-tribe, Beaver, chief of the Turky-tribe, with 20 warriors.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SHAWANESE. Kei&s;&s;inautchtha, a chief, and 6 warriors.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Kiya&s;huta, Turtle-Heart, Cu&s;taloga and Beaver, were the &s;peakers.</P>
<P>The general &s;ub&s;tance of what they had to offer, con&s;i&s;ted in excu&s;es for their late treachery and mi&s;conduct, throwing the blame on the ra&s;hne&s;s of their young men and the nations living to the we&s;tward of them, &s;uing for peace in the mo&s;t abject manner, and promi&s;ing &s;everally to deliver up all their pri&s;oners. After they had concluded, the Colonel promi&s;ed to give them an an&s;wer the next day, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, the army returning to the camp&mdash;The badne&s;s of the weather, however, prevented his meeting them again till the 20th, when he &s;poke to them in &s;ub&s;tance as follows, viz.</P>
<P><Q>THAT their pretences to palliate their guilt by throwing the blame on the we&s;tern nations, and the ra&s;hne&s;s of their young men, were weak and fri|volous,
<PB N="15" REF="010167_0015_0F7D44B5AF9CB498">
as it was in our power to have protected them again&s;t all the&s;e nati|ons, if they had &s;ollicited our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that it was their own duty to have cha&s;ti&s;ed their young men when they did wrong, and not to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be directed by them.</Q></P>
<P>HE recapitulated to them many in&s;tances of their former perfidy&mdash; <Q>their killing or captivating the traders who had been &s;ent among them at their own reque&s;t, and plundering their effects;&mdash;their attacking Fort Pitt, which had been built with their expre&s;s con&s;ent; their murdering four men that had been &s;ent on a public me&s;&s;age to them, thereby violat|ing the cu&s;toms held &s;acred among all nations, however barbarous; &mdash;their attacking the king's troops la&s;t year in the woods, and after being defeated in that attempt, falling upon our frontiers, where they had continued to murder our people to this day. &amp;c.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>HE told them how treacherou&s;ly they had violated even their late engage|ments with Col. Brad&s;treet, to whom they had promi&s;ed to deliver up their pri|&s;oners by the 10th of September la&s;t, and to recall all their warriors from the frontiers, which they had been &s;o far from complying with, that the pri&s;oners &s;till remained in their cu&s;tody, and &s;ome of their people were even now continu|ing their depredations; adding that the&s;e things which, he had mentioned, were only <Q>a &s;mall part of their numberle&s;s murders and breaches of faith; and that their conduct had always been equally perfidious.&mdash;You have, &s;aid he, pro|mi&s;ed at every former treaty, as you do now, that you would deliver up all your pri&s;oners, and have received every time, on that account, con&s;idera|ble pre&s;ents, but have never complied with that or any other engagement. I am now to tell you, therefore, that we will be no longer impo&s;ed upon by your promi&s;es. This army &s;hall not leave your country till you have fully complied with every condition that is to precede my treaty with you.</Q></P>
<Q><P>I have brought with me the relations of the people you have ma&s;&s;acred, or taken pri&s;oners. They are impatient for revenge; and it is with great difficulty that I can protect you again&s;t their ju&s;t re&s;entment, which is
<PB N="16" REF="010167_0016_0F7D44B671FA28B0">
only re&s;trained by the a&s;&s;urances given them, that no peace &s;hall ever be concluded till you have given us full &s;atisfaction.&mdash;</P>
<P>YOUR former allies, the Ottawas, Chipwas, Wyandots, and others, have made their peace with us. The Six Nations have joined us again&s;t you. We now &s;urround you, having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the waters of the Ohio, the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, the Miamis, and the lakes. All the French living in tho&s;e parts are now &s;ubjects to the king of Great-Britain, and dare no longer a&s;&s;i&s;t you. It is therefore in our power totally to extirpate you from being a people&mdash;But the Engli&s;h are a merciful and generous nation, aver&s;e to &s;hed the blood, even of their mo&s;t cruel enemies; and if it was po&s;&s;ible that you could convince us, that you &s;incerely repent of your pa&s;t perfidy, and that we could depend on your good behaviour for the future, you might yet hope for mercy and peace&mdash;If I find that you faithfully execute the follow|ing preliminary conditions, I will not treat you with the &s;everity you de&s;erve.</P>
<P>I GIVE you twelve days from this date to deliver into my hands at Waka|tamake all the pri&s;oners in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, without any exception; En|gli&s;hmen, Frenchmen, women and children; whether adopted in your tribes, married, or living among&s;t you under any denomination and pre|tence what&s;oever; together with all negroes. And you are to furni&s;h the &s;aid pri&s;oners with cloathing, provi&s;ions, and hor&s;es, to carry them to Fort Pitt.</P>
<P>WHEN you have fully complied with the&s;e conditions, you &s;hall then know on what terms you may obtain the peace you &s;ue for.&mdash;</P></Q>
<P>THIS &s;peech made an impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the &s;avages, which, it is hoped, will not &s;oon be eradicated. The firm and determined &s;pirit with which the Colonel delivered him&s;elf, their con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the aggravated injuries they had done us, and the view of the &s;ame commander and army that had &s;o
<PB N="17" REF="010167_0017_0F7D44B72D89F968">
&s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed them at Bu&s;hy-Run the preceeding year, now advanced into the very heart of their remote &s;ettlements, after penetrating thro' wilder|ne&s;&s;es which they had deemed impa&s;&s;ible by regular troops&mdash;all the&s;e things contributed to bend the haughty temper of the &s;avages to the lowe&s;t degree of aba&s;ement; &s;o that even their &s;peeches &s;eem to exhibit but few &s;pecimens of that &s;trong and ferocious eloquence, which their inflexible &s;pirit of indepen|dency has on former occa&s;ions in&s;pired. And tho' it is not to be doubted, if an opportunity had offered, but they would have fallen upon our army with their u&s;ual fiercene&s;s, yet when they &s;aw the vigilance and &s;pirit of our troops were &s;uch, that they could neither be attacked nor &s;urprized with any pro&s;|pect of &s;ucce&s;s, their &s;pirits &s;eemed to revolt from the one extreme of in&s;olent boldne&s;s, to the other of abject timidity. And happy will it be for them and for us, if the in&s;tances of our humanity and mercy, which they experienced in that critical &s;ituation, &s;hall make as la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions on their &s;avage di&s;|po&s;itions, as it is believed the in&s;tances of our bravery and power have done; &s;o that they may come to unite, with their fear of the latter, a love of the former; and have their minds gradually opened, by &s;uch examples, to the mild dictates of peace and civility.</P>
<P>The reader, it is to be hoped, will readily excu&s;e this digre&s;&s;ion if it &s;hould be thought one. I now re&s;ume our narrative. The two Delaware chiefs, at the clo&s;e of their &s;peech on the 17th, delivered 18 white pri&s;oners, and 83 &s;mall &s;ticks, expre&s;&s;ing the number of other pri&s;oners which they had in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and promi&s;ed to bring in as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. None of the Shawane&s;e kings appeared at the congre&s;s, and Kei&s;&s;inautchtha their deputy de|clined &s;peaking until the Colonel had an&s;wered the Delawares, and then with a dejected fullenne&s;s he promi&s;ed, in behalf of his nation, that they would &s;ub|mit to the terms pre&s;cribed to the other tribes.</P>
<P>The Colonel, however, determined to march farther into their country, knowing that the pre&s;ence of his army would be the be&s;t &s;ecurity for the per|formance of their promi&s;es; and required &s;ome of each nation to attend him in his march.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="010167_0018_0F7D44B7F0149BE8">KIYASHUTA addre&s;&s;ed the &s;everal nations, before their departure, <Q>de&s;ir|ing them to be &s;trong in complying with their engagements, that they might wipe away the reproach of their former breach of faith, and convince their brothers the Engli&s;h that they could &s;peak the truth; adding that he would conduct the army to the place appointed for receiving the pri&s;oners.</Q></P>
<P>MONDAY October 22d. The army attended by the Indian deputies, march|ed nine miles to camp No. 14. cro&s;&s;ing Margaret's creek about fifty feet wide&mdash; The day following, they proceeded &s;ixteen miles one quarter and &s;e|venty &s;even perches farther to camp No. 15. and halted there one day.</P>
<P>THURSDAY 25. They marched &s;ix miles, one half and &s;ixteen perches to camp No. 16, &s;ituated within a mile of the Forks of Mu&s;kingham; and this place was fixed upon in&s;tead of Wakautamike, as the mo&s;t central and convenient place to receive the pri&s;oners; for the principal Indian towns now lay round them, di&s;tant from &s;even to twenty miles; excepting only the lower Shawane&s;e town &s;ituated on Scioto river, which was about eighty miles; &s;o that from this place the army had it in their power to awe all the enemy's &s;ettlements and de&s;troy their towns, if they &s;hould not punc|tually fulfil the engagements they had entered into.&mdash;Four redoubts were built here oppo&s;ite to the four angles of the camp; the ground in the front was cleared, a &s;tore-hou&s;e for the provi&s;ions erected, and likewi&s;e a hou&s;e to receive, and treat of peace with, the Indians, when they &s;hould return.</P>
<P>ON Saturday 27th. A me&s;&s;enger arrived from king Cu&s;taloga, informing that he was on his way with his pri&s;oners, and al&s;o a me&s;&s;enger from the lower Shawane&s;e towns of the like import. The Colonel however, having rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the latter nation of backwardne&s;s, &s;ent one of their own people, de&s;iring them&mdash;<Q>to be punctual as to the time fixed; to provide a &s;ufficient quanti|ty of provi&s;ions to &s;ub&s;i&s;t the pri&s;oners; to bring the letters wrote to him la&s;t winter by the French commandant at Fort Chartres, which &s;ome of their
<PB N="19" REF="010167_0019_0F7D44B8B4C20310">
people had &s;topp'd ever &s;ince;</Q> adding that, <Q>as their nation had ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s at our not &s;haking hands with them, they were to know that the Engli&s;h never took their enemies by the hand, before peace was finally concluded.</Q></P>
<P>THE day following, the Shawane&s;e me&s;&s;enger returned, &s;aying that when he had proceeded as far as Wakautamike, the chief of that town undertook to proceed with the me&s;&s;age him&s;elf, and de&s;ired the other to return and acquaint the Engli&s;h that all his pri&s;oners were ready, and he was going to the lower towns to ha&s;ten theirs.</P>
<P>OCTOBER 28th. Peter the Caughnawaga chief, and 20 Indians of that nation arrived from Sandu&s;ki, with a letter from Colonel Brad&s;treet, in an&s;wer to one which Colonel Bouquet had &s;ent to him from Fort-Pitt, by two of the Indians who fir&s;t &s;poke to him in favour of the Shawane&s;e, as hath been already men|tioned. The &s;ub&s;tance of Colonel Brad&s;treet's letter was "that he had &s;ettled nothing with the Shawane&s;e and Delawares, nor received any pri&s;oners from them.&mdash;That he had acquainted all the Indian nations, as far as the Ilinois, the bay &amp;c. with the in&s;tructions he had received from General Gage, re|&s;pecting the peace he had lately made; that he had been in Sandu&s;ki-lake and up the river, as far as navigable for Indian canoes, for near a month; but that he found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tay longer in the&s;e parts; ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity obliging him to turn off the other way, &amp;c.</P>
<P>COL. BRADSTREET, without doubt, did all which circum&s;tances would per|mit, in his department; but his not being able to remain at Sandu&s;ki agree|able to the original plan, till matters were finally &s;ettled with the Ohio Indians, would have been an unfavourable incident, if Colonel Bouquet had not now had the chiefs of &s;undry tribes with him, and was &s;o far advanced into the In|dian country, that they thought it advi&s;eable to &s;ubmit to the conditions im|po&s;ed upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="010167_0020_0F7D44BA798B4AF0">THE Caughnawagas reported that the Indians on the lakes had delivered but few of their pri&s;oners; that the Ottawas had killed a great part of theirs, and the other nations had either done the &s;ame, or el&s;e kept them.</P>
<P>FROM this time to November 9th, was chiefly &s;pent in &s;ending and receiving me&s;&s;ages to and from the Indian towns, relative to the pri&s;oners, who were now coming into the camp one day after another in &s;mall parties, as the different nations arrived in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion they had been. The Colonel kept &s;o &s;tedfa&s;t|ly to this article of having every pri&s;oner delivered, that when the Delaware kings, Beaver and Cu&s;taloga, had brought in all their's except twelve which they promi&s;ed to bring in a few days, he refu&s;ed to &s;hake-hands or have the la&s;t talk with them, while a &s;ingle captive remained among them.</P>
<P>BY the 9th of November, mo&s;t of the pri&s;oners were arrived that could be ex|pected this &s;ea&s;on, amounting to <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Virginians, Males, 32, Females &amp; Children, 58.</P>
<P>Penn&s;ylvanians, Males, 49, Females &amp; Children, 67.</P>
<P>In all 206.</P></NOTE> 206 in the whole; be&s;ides about 100 more in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Shawane&s;e, which they promi&s;ed to deliver the following &s;pring. Mr. Smallman, formerly a Major in the Penn&s;ylvania troops, who had been taken la&s;t &s;ummer near Detroit by the Wyandots, and delivered to the Shawane&s;e, was among the number of tho&s;e whom they now brought in, and informed the Colonel that the rea&s;on of their not bringing the remainder of their pri&s;oners, was that many of their principal men, to whom they belonged, were gone to trade with the French, and would not return for &s;ix weeks; but that every one of their nation who were at home, had either brought or &s;ent theirs. He further &s;aid that, on the army's fir&s;t coming into the country, it had been reported among the Shawane&s;e that our intention was to de&s;troy them all, on which they had re&s;olved to kill their pri&s;oners and fight us; that a French trader who was with them, and had many barrels of powder and ball, made them a pre&s;ent of the whole, as &s;oon as they had come to this re&s;olution; but that, happily for the poor captives, ju&s;t as the Shawane&s;e were preparing to execute this tragedy, they received the Colonel's me&s;&s;age, informing them
<PB N="21" REF="010167_0021_0F7D44BB4A80EF30">
that his intentions were only to receive the pri&s;oners and to make peace with them on the &s;ame terms he &s;hould give to the Delawares.</P>
<P>ON this intelligence they &s;u&s;pended their cruel purpo&s;e, and began to collect as many of the pri&s;oners as they had power to deliver; but hearing immediately afterwards that one of our &s;oldiers had been killed near the camp at Mu&s;king|ham, and that &s;ome of their nation were &s;u&s;pected as guilty of the murder, they again imagined they would fall under our re&s;entment, and therefore determined once more to &s;tand out again&s;t us. For which purpo&s;e, after having brought their pri&s;oners as far as Wakautamike, where they heard this news, they collected them all into a field, and were going to kill them, when a &s;econd expre&s;s providentially arrived from Col. Bouquet, who a&s;&s;ured them that their nation was not even &s;upected of having any concern in the afore&s;aid murder; upon which they proceeded to the camp to deliver up the captives, who had thus twice &s;o narrowly e&s;caped becoming the victims of their barbarity.</P>
<P>ON Friday, November 9th, the Colonel, attended by mo&s;t of the principal officers, went to the conference-hou&s;e. The Senecas and Delawares were fir&s;t treated with. Kiya&s;huta and 10 warriors repre&s;ented the former. Cu&s;taloga and 20 warriors the latter.</P>
<P>KIYASHUTA &s;poke&mdash;<Q>With this &s;tring of wampum, we wipe the tears from your eyes&mdash;we deliver you the&s;e 3 pri&s;oners, which are the la&s;t of your fle&s;h and blood that remained among the Senecas and Cu&s;taloga's tribe of Delawares we gather together and bury with this belt <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A belt or &s;tring is always delivered when thus mentioned.</NOTE> all the bones of the people that have been killed during this unhappy war, which the Evil Spirit occa&s;ioned among us.

While you hold it fa&s;t by one end, and we by the other, we &s;hall always be able to di&s;cover any thing that may di&s;turb our friend&s;hip.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>THE Colonel an&s;wered that <Q>he had heard them with plea&s;ure; that he re|ceived the&s;e 3 la&s;t pri&s;oners they had to deliver, and joined in burying the bones of tho&s;e who had fallen in the war, &s;o that their place might be no more known. The peace you a&s;k for, you &s;hall now have. The king, my ma&s;ter and your father, has appointed me only to make war; but he has other &s;er|vants who are employed in the work of peace. Sir William John&s;on is em|powered for that purpo&s;e. To him you are to apply; but before I give you leave to go, two things are to be &s;ettled.</Q></P>
<Q><P N="1">1. As peace cannot be finally concluded here, you will deliver me two ho&s;|tages for the Senecas, and two for Cu&s;taloga's tribe, to remain in our hands at Fort Pitt, as a &s;ecurity, that you &s;hall commit no further ho&s;tilities or vio|lence again&s;t any of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects; and when the peace is concluded the&s;e ho&s;tages &s;hall be delivered &s;afe back to you.</P>
<P N="2">2. The deputies you are to &s;end to Sir William John&s;on, mu&s;t be fully empowered to treat for your tribes, and you &s;hall engage to abide by what|ever they &s;tipulate. In that treaty, every thing concerning trade and other matters will be &s;ettled by Sir William, to render the peace everla&s;ting; and the deputies you are to &s;end to him, as well as the ho&s;tages to be delivered to me, are to be named and pre&s;ented to me for my approbation.&mdash;</P></Q>
<P>THE Colonel, after promi&s;ing to deliver back two of their people, Capt. Pipe, and Capt. John, whom he had detained at Port-Pitt, took the chiefs by the hand for the fir&s;t time, which gave them great joy.</P>
<P>THE next conference was on November 10th, with the Turkey and Turtle tribes of Delawares, King Beaver their chief and 30 warriors repre&s;enting the former; and Kelappama brother to their <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The chief of the Turtle tribe, for &s;ome rea&s;on cho&s;e to ab&s;ent him&s;elf.</NOTE> chief with 25 warriors the latter.

Their &s;peech and the an&s;wer given, were much the &s;ame as above; excepting that the Colonel in&s;i&s;ted on their delivering up an Engli&s;hman, who had murdered one of our people on the frontiers and brought the &s;calp to them; and that they &s;hould appoint the &s;ame number of deputies and deliver the &s;ame number of ho&s;tages, for each of their tribes, as had been &s;tipulated for Cu&s;taloga's tribe.</P>
<P>NOVEMBER 11. King Beaver pre&s;ented &s;ix ho&s;tages to remain with Col. Bouquet, and five deputies to treat with Sir William John&s;on, who were ap|proved of. This day he acquainted the chiefs pre&s;ent that as he had great rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with the conduct of Nettowhatways, the chief of the Turtle tribe who had not appeared, he therefore depo&s;ed him; and that tribe were to chu&s;e and pre&s;ent another for his approbation. This they did a few days afterwards&mdash;Smile not reader at this tran&s;action; for tho' it may not be attended with &s;o many &s;plendid and flattering circum&s;tances to a commander, as the depo&s;ing an Ea&s;t Indian Nabob or chief; yet to penetrate into the wil|derne&s;&s;es where tho&s;e &s;tern We&s;t Indian Chieftains hold their &s;way, and to frown them from their throne, tho' but compo&s;ed of the unhewn log, will be found to require both re&s;olution and firmne&s;s; and their &s;ubmitting to it clearly &s;hews to what degree of humiliation they were reduced.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed. The Shawane&s;e &s;till remained to be treated with, and tho' this nation law them&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of yielding to the &s;ame condi|tions with the other tribes, yet there had appeared a dilatorine&s;s and &s;ullen haughtine&s;s in all their conduct, which rendered it very &s;u&s;picious.</P>
<P>THE 12th of November was appointed for the conference with them; which was managed on their part by Kei&s;&s;inautchtha and Nimwha their chiefs, with the Red Hawke, Lavi&s;&s;imo, Ben&s;iva&s;ica, Eweecunwee, Keigleighque, and 40 warriors; the Caughnawaga, Seneca and Delaware chiefs, with a|bout 60 warriors, being al&s;o pre&s;ent.</P>

&s;trange mixture of fierce pride, and humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall add a pa&s;&s;age or two from his &s;peech.</P>
<P>BROTHER,</P>
<P><Q>You will li&s;ten to us your younger brothers; and as we di&s;cover &s;ome|thing in your eyes that looks di&s;&s;atisfaction with us, we now wipe away every thing bad between us that you may clearly &s;ee&mdash;You have heard many bad &s;tories of us&mdash;We clean your ears that you may hear&mdash;We re|move every thing bad from your heart, that it may be like the heart of your ance&s;tors, when they thought of nothing but good.</Q> [Here he gave a &s;tring.]</P>
<P><Q>BROTHER; when we &s;aw you coming this road, you advanced towards us with a Tomahawk in your hand; but we your younger brothers take it out of your hands and throw it up to God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Their u&s;ual figure for making peace is burying the hatchet; but as &s;uch hatchets may be dug up again, perhaps he thought this new expre&s;&s;ion of "&s;ending it up to God, or the Good Spirit," a much &s;tronger emblem of the permanency and &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s of the peace now to be made.</NOTE> to di&s;po&s;e of as he plea&s;es; by which means we hope never to &s;ee it more. And now brother, we beg leave that you who are a warrior, will take hold of this chain (giving a &s;tring) of friend&s;hip, and receive it from us, who are al&s;o warriors, and let us think no more of war, in pity to our old men, women and children</Q>&mdash;Intimating, by this la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, that it was mere compa&s;&s;ion to them, and not inability to fight, that made their nation de&s;ire peace.</P>
<P>HE then produced a treaty held with the government of Penn&s;ylvania 1701, and three me&s;&s;ages or letters from that government of different dates; and concluded thus.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Now Brother, I beg WE who are warriors may forget our di&s;putes, and renew the friend&s;hip which appears by the&s;e papers to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween our fathers.</Q>&mdash;He promi&s;ed, in behalf of the re&s;t of their nation, who were gone to a great di&s;tance to hunt, and could not have notice to attend the treaty, that they &s;hould certainly come to Fort-Pitt in the &s;pring, and bring the remainder of the pri&s;oners with them.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="010167_0025_0F7D44C035D93F70">AS the &s;ea&s;on was far advanced, and the Colonel could not &s;tay long in the&s;e remote parts, he was obliged to re&s;t &s;atisfied with the pri&s;oners the Sha|wane&s;e had brought; taking ho&s;tages, and laying them under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations, for the delivery of the re&s;t; knowing that no other effectual method could at pre&s;ent be pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>HE expo&s;tulated with them on account of their pa&s;t conduct, and told them&mdash;<Q>that the &s;peech they had delivered would have been agreeable to him, if their actions had corre&s;ponded with their words. You have &s;poken, &s;aid he, much of peace, but have neglected to comply with the only con|dition, upon which you can obtain it. Kei&s;&s;inautchtha, one of your chiefs, met me a month ago at Tu&s;carawas, and accepted the &s;ame terms of peace for your nation, that were pre&s;cribed to the Senecas and Delawares; pro|mi&s;ing in ten days from that time to meet me here with all your pri&s;oners&mdash; After waiting for you till now, you are come at la&s;t, only with a part of them, and propo&s;e putting off the delivery of the re&s;t till the &s;pring&mdash;What right have you to expect different terms from tho&s;e granted to the Delawares &amp;c. who have given me entire &s;atisfaction by their ready &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to every thing required of them?&mdash;But I will cut this matter &s;hort with you; and before I explain my&s;elf further, I in&s;i&s;t on your immediate an&s;wer to the following que&s;tions.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <Q>Will you forthwith collect and deliver up all the pri&s;oners yet in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the French living among you, with all the Negroes you have taken from us in this or any other war; and that without any ex|ception or eva&s;ion what&s;oever?</Q></P>

<P>BENEVISSICO replyed that <Q>they agreed to give the ho&s;tages required, and &s;aid that he him&s;elf would immediately return to their lower towns and col|lect

all our fle&s;h and blood that remained among them, and that we &s;hould &s;ee them at Fort-Pitt <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will appear, by the po&s;t&s;cript to this account, that the Shawane&s;e have fulfilled this engagement.</NOTE> as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;That, as to the French, they had no power over them. They were &s;ubjects to the king of England. We might do with them what we plea&s;ed; tho' he believed they were all re|turned before this time to their own country&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>THEY then delivered their ho&s;tages, and the Colonel told them <Q>that tho' he had brought a Tomahawk in his hand, yet as they had now &s;ubmit|ted, he would not let it fall on their heads, but let it drop to the ground, no more to be &s;een. He exhorted them to exerci&s;e kindne&s;s to the captives, and look upon them now as brothers and no longer pri&s;oners; adding that he intended to &s;end &s;ome of their relations along with the Indians, to &s;ee their friends collected and brought to Fort-Pitt. He promi&s;ed to give them letters to Sir William John&s;on, to facilitate a final peace, and de&s;ired them to be &s;trong in performing every thing &s;tipulated.</Q></P>
<P>THE Caughnawagas, the Delawares and Senecas, &s;everally addre&s;&s;ed the Sha|wane&s;e, as grand children and nephews, <Q>to perform their promi&s;es, and to be &s;trong in doing good, that this peace might be everla&s;ting.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>AND here I am to enter on a &s;cene, re&s;erved on purpo&s;e for this place, that the thread of the foregoing narrative might not be interrupted&mdash;a &s;cene, which language indeed can but weakly de&s;cribe; and to which the Poet or Painter might have repaired to enrich their highe&s;t colorings of the variety of human pa&s;&s;ions; the Philo&s;opher to find ample &s;ubject for his mo&s;t &s;erious reflections; and the Man to exerci&s;e all the tender and &s;ympathetic feelings of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>THE &s;cene, I mean, was the arrival of the pri&s;oners in the camp; where were to be &s;een fathers and mothers recognizing and cla&s;ping their once-lo&s;t babes; hu&s;bands hanging round the necks of their newly-recovered wives; &s;i&s;ters and brothers unexpectedly meeting together after long &s;eparation, &s;carce able to &s;peak the &s;ame language, or, for &s;ome time, to be &s;ure that they were children of the &s;ame parents! In all the&s;e interviews, joy and rapture inexpre&s;&s;ible were
<PB N="27" REF="010167_0027_0F7D44C281F01418">
&s;een, while feelings of a very different nature were painted in the looks of others;&mdash;flying from place to place in eager enquiries after relatives not found! trembling to receive an an&s;wer to their que&s;tions! di&s;tracted with doubts, hopes and fears, on obtaining no account of tho&s;e they &s;ought for! or &s;tiffened into living monuments of horror and woe, on learning their unhappy fate!</P>
<P>THE Indians too, as if wholly forgetting their u&s;ual &s;avagene&s;s, bore a capi|tal part in heightning this mo&s;t affecting &s;cene. They delivered up their be|loved captives with the utmo&s;t reluctance; &s;hed torrents of tears over them, recommending them to the care and protection of the commanding officer. Their regard to them continued all the time they remained in camp. They vi&s;ited them from day to day; and brought them what corn, &s;kins, hor&s;es and other matters, they had be&s;towed on them, while in their families; accom|panied with other pre&s;ents, and all the marks of the mo&s;t &s;incere and tender affection. Nay, they did not &s;top here, but, when the army marched, &s;ome of the Indians &s;ollicited and obtained leave to accompany their former captives all the way to Fort-Pitt, and employed them&s;elves in hunting and bringing provi&s;ions for them on the road. A young Mingo carri|ed this &s;till further, and gave an in&s;tance of love which would make a figure even in romance. A young woman of Virginia was among the captives, to whom he had form'd &s;o &s;trong an attachment, as to call her his wife. Again&s;t all remon&s;trances of the imminent danger to which he expo&s;ed him&s;elf by approaching to the frontiers, he per&s;i&s;ted in following her, at the ri&s;k of being killed by the &s;urviving relations of many unfortunate per&s;ons, who had been captivated or &s;calped by tho&s;e of his nation.</P>
<P>THOSE qualities in &s;avages challenge our ju&s;t e&s;teem. They &s;hould make us charitably con&s;ider their barbarities as the effects of wrong education, and fal&s;e notions of bravery and heroi&s;m; while we &s;hould look on their virtues as &s;ure marks that nature has made them fit &s;ubjects of cultivation as well as us; and that we are called by our &s;uperior advantages to yield them all the helps we can in this way. Cruel and unmerciful as they are, by habit and long ex|ample, in war, yet whenever they come to give way to the native dictates of humanity, they exerci&s;e virtues which Chri&s;tians need not blu&s;h to imitate.
<PB N="28" REF="010167_0028_0F7D44C331EABF60">
When they once determine to give life, they give every thing with it, which, in their apprehen&s;ion, belongs to it. From every enquiry that has been made, it appears&mdash;that no woman thus &s;aved is pre&s;erved from ba&s;e motives, or need fear the violation of her honor. No child is otherwi&s;e treated by the per&s;ons adopting it than the children of their own body. The perpetual &s;lavery of tho&s;e captivated in war, is a notion which even their barbarity has not yet &s;ugge&s;ted to them. Every captive whom their affection, their caprice, or whatever el&s;e, leads them to be, is &s;oon incorporated with them, and fares alike with them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>THESE in&s;tances of Indian tenderne&s;s and humanity were thought worthy of particular notice. The like in&s;tances among our own people will not &s;eem &s;trange; and therefore I &s;hall only mention one, out of a multitude that might be given on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>AMONG the captives, a woman was brought into the camp at Mu&s;kingham, with a babe about three months old at her brea&s;t. One of the Virginia-volun|teers &s;oon knew her to be his wife, who had been taken by the Indians about &s;ix months before. She was immediately delivered to her overjoyed hu&s;band. He flew with her to his tent, and cloathed her and his child in proper apparel. But their joy, after the fir&s;t tran&s;ports, was &s;oon damped by the reflection that another dear child of about two years old, captivated with the mother, and &s;eparated from her, was &s;till mi&s;&s;ing, although many children had been brought in.</P>
<P>A FEW days afterwards, a number of other pri&s;oners were brought to the camp, among whom were &s;everal more children, The woman was &s;ent for, and one, &s;uppo&s;ed to be hers, was produced to her At fir&s;t &s;ight &s;he was uncertain, but viewing the child with great earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;he &s;oon recollected its features; and was &s;o overcome with joy, that literally forgetting her &s;uck|ing child &s;he dropt it from her arms, and catching up the new found child in an exta&s;y, pre&s;&s;ed it to her brea&s;t, and bur&s;ting into tears carried it off, unable to &s;peak for joy. The father &s;eizing up the babe &s;he had let fall, fol|lowed her in no le&s;s tran&s;port and affection.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="010167_0029_0F7D44C4149ED2E8">AMONG the children who had been carried off young, and had long lived with the Indians, it is not to be expected that any marks of joy would appear on being re&s;tored to their parents or relatives. Having been accu&s;tomed to look upon the Indians as the only connexions they had, having been tenderly treated by them, and &s;peaking their language, it is no wonder that they con|&s;idered their new &s;tate in the light of a captivity, and parted from the &s;avages with tears.</P>
<P>BUT it mu&s;t not be denied that there were even &s;ome grown per&s;ons who &s;hewed an unwillingne&s;s to return. The Shawane&s;e were obliged to bind &s;e|veral of their pri&s;oners and force them along to the camp; and &s;ome women, who had been delivered up, afterwards found means to e&s;cape and run back to the Indian towns. Some, who could not make their e&s;cape, clung to their &s;a|vage acquaintance at parting, and continued many days in bitter lamenta|tions, even refu&s;ing &s;u&s;tenance.</P>
<P>FOR the honor of humanity, we would &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e per&s;ons to have been of the lowe&s;t rank, either bred up in ignorance and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing penury, or who had lived &s;o long with the Indians as to forget all their former connex|ions. For, ea&s;y and uncon&s;trained as the &s;avage life is, certainly it could never be put in competiton with the ble&s;&s;ings of improved life and the light of reli|gion, by any per&s;ons who have had the happine&s;s of enjoying, and the capacity of di&s;cerning, them.</P>
<P>EVERY thing being now &s;ettled with the Indians, the army decamped on Sunday 18th November, and marched for Fort-Pitt, where it arrived on the 28th. The regular troops were immediately &s;ent to garri&s;on the different po&s;ts on the communication, and the provincial troops, with the captives, to their &s;everal provinces. Here ended this expedition, in which it is remarkable that, notwith&s;tanding the many difficulties attending it, the troops were never in want of any nece&s;&s;aries; continuing perfectly healthy during the whole cam|paign; in which no life was lo&s;t, except the man mentioned to have been kill|ed at Mu&s;kingham.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="010167_0030_0F7D44C4C07A48B0">IN the beginning of January 1765, Colonel Bouquet arrived at Philadelphia, receiving, wherever he came, every po&s;&s;ible mark of gratitude and e&s;teem from the people in general; and particularly from the overjoyed relations of the captives, whom he had &s;o happily, and without blood&s;hed, re&s;tored to their country and friends.

<P>SOON afterwards the Colonel received a very polite and affectionate letter from Governor Fauquier, dated 25th of December, enclo&s;ing Re&s;olves of the honorable members of his Maje&s;ty's Council, and of the hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es, for the colony and dominion of Virginia.</P>
<P>THOSE re&s;pectable bodies unanimou&s;ly returned their thanks to him for the activity, &s;pirit and zeal, with which he had reduced the Indians to terms of peace, and compelled tho&s;e &s;avages to deliver up &s;o many of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects whom they had in captivity. They further reque&s;ted the Governor to recommend him to his Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters, as an officer of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, in this and every former &s;ervice in which he has been engaged.</P>
<P>THE Colonel, in his an&s;wer, acknowledged the ready a&s;&s;i&s;tance and coun|tenance which he had always received from the Governor and colony of Vir|ginia in carrying on the King's &s;ervice; and mentioned his particular obli|gations to Col. LEWIS, for his zeal and good conduct during the campaign.</P>
<P>THE honors thus be&s;towed on him, his own mode&s;ty made him de|&s;irous of transfering to the officers and army under his command; and in|deed the mutual confidence and harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and them,

highly redound to the reputation of both. He has taken every occa&s;ion of doing ju&s;tice to the particular merit of Col.

<P>THE reader will ob&s;erve that the public bodies who pre&s;ented the&s;e addre&s;&s;es to the Colonel, not only wi&s;hed to expre&s;s their own gratitude, but likewi&s;e to be in&s;trumental in recommending him to the advancement his &s;er|vices merited. And &s;urely it is a happy circum&s;tance to obtain promotion, not only unenvied, but even with the general approbation and good wi&s;hes of the public. It ought, however, to be mentioned, that on the fir&s;t account his Maje&s;ty received of this expedition, and long before tho&s;e te&s;timonies could reach England, he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, of his own royal goodne&s;s and as a reward of the Colonel's merit, to promote him to the rank of BRIGADIER GENERAL, and to the command of the &s;outhern di&s;trict of America. And as he is rendered as dear, by his private virtues, to tho&s;e who have the honour of his more intimate acquaintance, as he is by his military &s;ervices to the pub|lic, it is hoped he may long continue among us; where his experienced abilities will enable him, and his love of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution entitle him, to fill any future tru&s;t to which his Maje&s;ty may be plea&s;ed to call him.&mdash;</P>

<P>_IT was mentioned in the 25th page of this account, that the Shawane&s;e brought only a part of their pri&s;oners with them to Col.

Therefore we hope our Father will now take better care of his children, than has heretofore been done.&mdash;</P>
<P>YOU put us in mind of our promi&s;e to Col. Bouquet; which was to bring your fle&s;h and blood to be delivered at this place.

<P>_THE long continued ravages of the Indians on the frontiers of the Briti&s;h colonies in America, and the fatal overthrows which they have &s;ometimes given our be&s;t di&s;ciplined troops, e&s;pecially in the beginning of the late war, have rendered them an object of our con&s;ideration, even in their military capacity. And as but few officers, who may be employed again&s;t them, can have opportunities to ob&s;erve the true cau&s;es of their advantages over European troops in the woods, it is with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure that I now proceed to lay before the public the following valuable papers, which I mentioned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the introduction.</NOTE> to have been communicated to me by an officer of great abilities and long experience, in our wars with the Indians.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. OF THE TEMPER AND GENIUS OF THE INDIANS.</HEAD>
<P>THE love of liberty is innate in the &s;avage&punc; and &s;eems the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;tate of nature. His de&s;ires and wants being few are ea&s;ily gratified, and leave him much time to &s;pare, which he would &s;pend in idlene&s;s, if hunger did not force him to hunt. That exerci&s;e makes him &s;trong, active and bold, rai&s;es his courage, and fits him for war, in which he u&s;es the &s;ame &s;tratagems and cruelty as again&s;t the wild bea&s;ts; making no &s;cruple to em|ploy treachery and perfidy to vanqui&s;h his enemy.</P>
<P>JEALOUS of his independency and of his property, he will not &s;uffer the lea&s;t encroachment on either; and upon the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion, fired with re&s;entment, he becomes an implacable enemy, and flies to arms to vindicate his right, or revenge an injury.</P>
<P>THE advantages of the&s;e &s;avages over civilized nations are both natural and acquired. They are tall and well limbed, remarkable for their activity, and have a peircing eye and quick ear, which are of great &s;ervice to them in the woods.</P>
<P>LIKE bea&s;ts of prey, they are patient, deceitful, and rendered by habit almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to the common feelings of humanity. Their barbarous cu&s;tom of &s;calping their enemies, in the heat of action; the exqui&s;ite tor|ments often inflicted by them on tho&s;e re&s;erved for a more deliberate fate; their general ferocity of manners, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;es wherewith they have often been flu&s;h'd, have con&s;pired to render their name terrible, and &s;ome times to &s;trike a pannic even into our brave&s;t and be&s;t di&s;ciplined troops.</P>
<P>THEIR acquired advantages are, that they have been inured to bear the extremes of heat and cold; and from their infancy, in Winter and Summer, to plunge them&s;elves in cold &s;treams, and to go almo&s;t naked, expo&s;ed to the &s;corching &s;un or nipping fro&s;ts, till they arrive to the &s;tate of manhood. Some of them de&s;troy the &s;en&s;ation of the &s;kin by &s;cratching it with the &s;hort and
<PB N="39" REF="010167_0038_0F7D44CAB006A998">
&s;harp teeth of &s;ome animal, di&s;po&s;ed in the form of a curry-comb, which makes them regardle&s;s of briars and thorns in running thro' thickets. Rivers are no ob&s;tacles to them in their wild excur&s;ions. They either &s;wim over, or cro&s;s them on rafts or canoes, of an ea&s;y and ready con&s;truction.</P>
<P>IN their expeditions they live chiefly by hunting, or on wild fruits and roots, with which the woods &s;upply them almo&s;t every where.</P>
<P>THEY can bear hunger and thir&s;t for &s;everal days, without &s;lackening, on that account, their per&s;everance in any propo&s;ed enterprize.</P>
<P>BY con&s;tant practice in hunting, they learn to &s;hoot with great &s;kill, either with bows, or fire arms; and to &s;teal unperceived upon their prey, pur|&s;uing the tracts of men and bea&s;ts, which would be imperceptible to an Eu|ropean. They can run for a whole day without halting, when flying from an enemy, or when &s;ent on any me&s;&s;age. They &s;teer, as if by in&s;tinct, thro' trackle&s;s woods, and with a&s;toni&s;hing patience can lie whole days motionle&s;s in ambu&s;h to &s;urprize an enemy, e&s;teeming no labour or per&s;everance too painful to obtain their ends.</P>
<P>THEY be&s;mear their bodies with Bear's grea&s;e, which defends them again&s;t rains and damps, as well as again&s;t the &s;tings of Mu&s;kitoes and Gnats. It likewi&s;e &s;upples their limbs, and makes them as &s;lippery as the antient Gla|diators, who could not be held fa&s;t when &s;eized in fight.</P>
<P>PLAIN food, con&s;tant exerci&s;e, and living in the open air, pre&s;erve them healthy and vigorous.</P>
<P>THEY are powerfully excited to war by the cu&s;tom e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, of paying di&s;tingui&s;hed honors to Warriors.</P>
<P>THEY fight only when they think to have the advantage, but cannot be forced to it, being &s;ure by their &s;peed to elude the mo&s;t eager pur&s;uit.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="010167_0039_0F7D44CB70192FC8">THEIR dre&s;s con&s;i&s;t of the &s;kins of &s;ome wild bea&s;t, or a blanket, a &s;hirt either of linen, or of dre&s;&s;ed &s;kins, a breech clout, leggins, reaching half way up the thigh, and fa&s;tened to a belt, with mokaw&s;ons on their feet. They u&s;e no ligatures that might ob&s;truct the circulation of their blood, or agility of their limbs. They &s;have their head, re&s;erving only a &s;mall tuft of hair on the top; and &s;lit the outer part of the ears, to which, by weights, they give a circular form, extending it down to their &s;houlders.</P>
<P>THEY adorn them&s;elves with ear and no&s;e rings, bracelets of &s;ilver and wampum, and paint their faces with various colours. When they prepare for an engagement they paint them&s;elves black, and &s;ight naked.</P>
<P>THEIR arms are a &s;u&s;il, or rifle, a powder horn, a &s;hot pouch, a toma|hawk, and a &s;calping knife hanging to their neck.</P>
<P>WHEN they are in want of fire arms, they &s;upply them by a bow, a &s;pear, or a death hammer, which is a &s;hort club made of hard wood.</P>
<P>THEIR u&s;ual uten&s;ils are a kettle, a &s;poon, a looking gla&s;s, an awl, a &s;teel to &s;trike fire, &s;ome paint, a pipe and tobacco pouch. For want of tobacco, they &s;moke &s;ome particular leaves, or the bark <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> willow; which is almo&s;t their continual occupation.</P>
<P>THUS lightly equiped do the &s;avages lie in wait to attack, at &s;ome difficult pa&s;s, the European &s;oldier, heavily accoutred, harra&s;&s;ed by a tedious march, and encumbered with an unwieldy convoy.</P>
<P>EXPERIENCE has convinced us that it is not our intere&s;t to be at war with them; but if after having tried all means to avoid it, they force us to it, (which in all probability will often happen) we &s;hould endeavour to &s;ight them upon more equal terms, and regulate our Manoeuvres upon tho&s;e of the enemy we are to engage, and the nature of the country we are to act in.</P>
<P>IT does not appear from our accounts of Indian wars, that the &s;avages were as brave formerly as we have found them of late; which mu&s;t be imputed
<PB N="41" REF="010167_0040_0F7D44CD0EE0DE50">
to their unexpected &s;ucce&s;&s;es again&s;t our troops on &s;ome occa&s;ions, particu|larly in 1755; and from the little re&s;i&s;tance they have &s;ince met with from de|fencele&s;s inhabitants.</P>
<P>IT is certain that even at this day, they &s;eldom expo&s;e their per&s;ons to dan|ger, and depend entirely upon their dexterity in concealing them&s;elves during an engagement, never appearing openly, unle&s;s they have &s;truck their ene|mies with terror, and have thereby rendered them incapable of defence.&mdash;From whence it may be inferred that, if they were beat two or three times, they would lo&s;e that confidence in&s;pired by &s;ucce&s;s, and be le&s;s inclined to en|gage in wars which might end fatally for them. But this cannot rea&s;onably be expected, till we have troops trained to fight them in their own way, with the additional advantage of European courage and di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>ANY deviation from our e&s;tabli&s;hed military &s;y&s;tem would be needle&s;s, if valor, zeal, order and good conduct, were &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue this light-foot|ed enemy. The&s;e qualities are con&s;picuous in our troops; but they are too heavy, and indeed too valuable, to be employed alone in a de&s;tructive &s;ervice for which they were never intended. They require the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of lighter corps, who&s;e dre&s;s, arms and exerci&s;es, &s;hould be adapted to this new kind of war.</P>
<P>THIS opinion is &s;upported by the example of many warlike nations, of which I beg leave to mention the following.</P>
<P>THE learned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Joannis Antonii Valtrini Lbr. de re milit. Vet.

<P><PB N="42" REF="010167_0041_0F7D44CDDC84A4D8">THE defeat of Antony and Cra&s;&s;us by the Parthians, of Curio by the Numidians, and many other in&s;tances, convinced the Romans that their le|gions, who had conquered &s;o many nations, were not fit to engage light-troops, which, harra&s;&s;ing them continually, evaded all their endeavours to bring them to a clo&s;e engagement; and it is probable that if Julius Cae&s;ar had not been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, when he was preparing to march again&s;t the &s;ame Par|thians, to wipe off the reproach of the former defeats, he would have added to his legions a greater number of light troops, formed upon the principles and method of that nation, and have left us u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons for the conduct of a war again&s;t our &s;avages.</P>
<P>THAT he did not think the attack of irregular troops contemptible, ap|pears clearly in &s;everal parts of his commentaries, and particularly in the Afri|can war. The various embarra&s;ments he met with from the enemy he had then to deal with, nece&s;&s;arily call to our mind many &s;imilar circum&s;tances in the cour&s;e of our wars with the Indians; and the pains he took to in&s;truct his &s;ol|diers to &s;tand and repel the &s;kirmi&s;hes of the nimble Africans, may furni&s;h in&s;truction to us in our military operations again&s;t the &s;avage Americans.</P>

His legions forming them&s;elves, &s;oon beat the enemy from the higher ground. And now think|ing all &s;afe, he begins to pur&s;ue his march. But immediately the enemy break forth from the neighbouring hills; and the Numidians, with their

light armed foot, who are wonderfully nimble, always mixing and keeping equal pace with the cavalry in charging or retiring, fall afre&s;h on the Ro|man foot. Thus they frequently renewed the charge, and &s;till retired when he endeavoured to bring them to clo&s;e engagement. If but two or three of his veterans faced about and ca&s;t their piles with vigor, two thou|&s;and of the enemy would fly, then returning rally again, making it their bu&s;ine&s;s to harra&s;s his march, and to pre&s;s upon his rear, following at &s;ome di&s;tance and throwing their darts at the legions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>CAESAR, having &s;o &s;ubtil an enemy to deal with, in&s;tructed his &s;oldiers, not like a general who had been victorious in the mo&s;t arduous exploits, but as a <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lani&s;ta, in Latin, is an in&s;tructor of gladiators, which in Engli&s;h can only be tran&s;lated a "Fen|cing-ma&s;ter."</NOTE> Fencing-Ma&s;ter would in&s;truct his &s;cholars; teaching them with what pace to retreat from the enemy, and how to return to the charge; how far to advance, and how far to retire; and likewi&s;e in what place and man|ner to ca&s;t their piles. For their light-armed infantry gave him the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, deterring his troopers from meeting them, by killing their hor&s;es with their javelins, and wearying his legions by their &s;wiftne&s;s. For whenever his heavy-armed foot faced about, and endeavoured to re|turn their charge, they quickly avoided the danger by flight.</Q></P>
<P>BUT without going back to the ancients, we have &s;een this maxim adopted in our days. Mar&s;hal de Saxe finding the French army harra&s;&s;ed by the Hu&s;|&s;ars and other Au&s;trian light troops, formed al&s;o &s;everal corps of them of diffe|rent kinds; and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia in his fir&s;t war introduced them into his army, and has augmented and employed them ever &s;ince with &s;ucce&s;s. We have our&s;elves made u&s;e of them in the two la&s;t wars in Europe: but the light troops wanted in America mu&s;t be trained upon different principles. The enemies we have to deal with, are infinitely more active and dangerous than the Hu&s;&s;ars and Pandours; or even the Africans abovementioned. For the American &s;avages, after their rapid incur&s;ions, retreat to their towns, at a great di&s;tance from our &s;ettlements, through thickety woods almo&s;t impenetra|ble
<PB N="44" REF="010167_0043_0F7D44D48D7144D8">
to our heavy and unwieldy corps, compo&s;ed of &s;oldiers loaded with cloathes, baggage and provi&s;ions, who, when fatigued by a long march, mu&s;t be a very unequal match to engage the nimble &s;avage in woods, which are his native element.</P>
<P>ANOTHER unavoidable incumbrance in our expeditions, ari&s;es from the pro|vi&s;ions and baggage of the army, for which a road mu&s;t be opened, and bridges thrown over rivers and &s;wamps. This creates great labour, retards and weakens the line of march, and keeps the troops tied to a convoy which they cannot lo&s;e &s;ight of, without expo&s;ing it to become a prey to a vigilant enemy, continually hovering about to &s;eize every advantage.</P>
<P>AN European, to be a proper judge of this kind of war, mu&s;t have lived &s;ometime in the va&s;t fore&s;ts of America; otherwi&s;e he will hardly be able to con|ceive a continuity of woods without end. In &s;pite of his endeavours, his ima|gination will betray him into an expectation of open and clear grounds, and he will be apt to calculate his Manoeuvres accordingly, too much upon the prin|ciples of war in Europe.</P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on, who is entirely unacquainted with the nature of this &s;ervice, to be put at the head of an expedition in America. We will further &s;uppo&s;e that he has made the di&s;po&s;itions u&s;ual in Europe for a march, or to receive an enemy; and that he is then attacked by the &s;avages. He can|not di&s;cover them, tho' from every tree, log or bu&s;h, he receives an ince&s;&s;ant fire, and ob&s;erves that few of their &s;hot are lo&s;t. He will not he&s;itate to charge tho&s;e invi&s;ible enemies, but he will charge in vain. For they are as cautious to avoid a clo&s;e engagement, as indefatigable in harra&s;&s;ing his troops; and notwith&s;tanding all his endeavours, he will &s;till find him&s;elf &s;urrounded by a circle of fire, which like an artificial horizon follows him every where.</P>
<P>UNABLE to rid him&s;elf of an enemy who never &s;tands his attacks, and flies when pre&s;&s;ed, only to return upon him again with equal agility and vigor; he will &s;ee the courage of his heavy troops droop, and their &s;trength at la&s;t fail them by repeated and ineffectual efforts.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="010167_0044_0F7D44D697199EB8">HE mu&s;t therefore think of a retreat, unle&s;s he can force his way through the enemy. But how is this to be effected? his baggage and provi&s;ions are unloaded and &s;cattered, part of his hor&s;es and drivers killed, others di&s;per&s;ed by fear, and his wounded to be carried by &s;oldiers already fainting under the fa|tigue of a long action. The enemy encouraged by his di&s;tre&s;s will not fail to encrea&s;e the di&s;order, by pre&s;&s;ing upon him on every &s;ide, with redoubled fury and &s;avage howlings.</P>
<P>HE will probably form a circle or a &s;quare, to keep off &s;o daring an enemy, ready at the lea&s;t opening to fall upon him with the de&s;tructive Tomahawk: but the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, tho' a tolerable &s;hift for defence, are neither proper for an attack, nor a march thro' the woods&mdash;</P>
<P>THIS is not an imaginary &s;uppo&s;ition, but the true &s;tate of an engagement with the Indians, experienced by the troops who have fought again&s;t them. Neither is there any thing new or extraordinary in this way of fighting, which &s;eems to have been common to mo&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Cae&s;. comm. lib. V de bello Gallico, et lib.

<P>WHAT is then to be done to extricate our little army from impending de|&s;truction?</P>
<P>THIS is a problem which I do not pretend to re&s;olve. But as every man would, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, determine him&s;elf &s;ome way or other, I will propo&s;e my own &s;entiments, founded upon &s;ome ob&s;ervations which I believe invaria|ble in all engagements with &s;avages.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t, that their general maxim is to &s;urround their enemy.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd, that they fight &s;cattered, and never in a compact body.</P>
<P>The third, that they never &s;tand their ground when attacked, but imme|diately give way, to return to the charge.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. GENERAL IDEA OF AN ESTABLISHMENT OF LIGHT TROOPS, FOR THE SERVICE OF THE WOODS.</HEAD>
<P>I &s;hall only venture a few notions &s;ugge&s;ted by experience upon this &s;ubject, chiefly with a view to recommend it to the con&s;ideration of per&s;ons capable of propo&s;ing a proper method of forming &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment: and in order to be better under&s;tood, I will &s;uppo&s;e a corps of 500 men to be rai&s;ed and di&s;ci|plined for the woods, be&s;ides two troops of light hor&s;e, to which a company of artificers might be added. The fitte&s;t men for that &s;ervice would be the natives of America bred upon the frontiers, and inli&s;ted between the age of 15 and 20 years, to be di&s;charged between 30 and 35.</P>

<HEAD>CLOATHING.</HEAD>
<P>THE cloathing of a &s;oldier for the campaign might con&s;i&s;t of a &s;hort coat of brown cloth, lappelled, and without plaits; a &s;trong tanned &s;hirt, &s;hort trow|&s;ers, leggins, mokaw&s;ons or &s;hoe packs, a &s;ailors hat, a blanket, a knap&s;ack for provi&s;ions, and oiled <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following Watch-coat was contrived by an officer, who&s;e name I do not remember. But in|&s;tead of the oiled linnen to be put under the hat, a cap might perhaps an&s;wer better. He writes as fol|lows, viz.</P>
<Q><P>As the Indian war will require frequent incur&s;ions into a wild country, where a man &s;ick or wounded, is in &s;everal re&s;pects more detrimental to the &s;ervice than a man killed, every thing that may contribute to the health of the men is of moment.</P>
<P>In this view, I propo&s;e a &s;ort of &s;urtout, to pre&s;erve men in a great mea&s;ure both from wet and cold.</P>
<P>Take a large checked &s;hirt, of about half a crown &s;terling per yard, for it &s;hould be pretty fine; cut off the wri&s;t-bands, and continue the opening of the brea&s;t down to the bottom; &s;ew up the &s;ide; from the gu&s;&s;ets downwards; rip out the gathers in the fore parts of the collar as far as the &s;houlder &s;traps, and re&s;ew it plain to the collar.</P>
<P>The &s;hirt will then become a &s;ort of watch coat like a bed gown, with very wide &s;leeves.</P>
<P>Take a quantity of lin&s;eed oil, and boil it gently till one half is dimini&s;hed, to which put a &s;mall quantity of litharge of gold, and when it is well incorporated with the oil, lay it on with a bru&s;h upon the watch-coat, &s;o that it &s;hall be every where equally wet.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e the watch coat, hung in a garret, or other covered place, and &s;o &s;u&s;pended by crooked pins and packthreads in the extremities of the &s;leeves and edges of the collar, that one part &s;hall not touch another. In a &s;hort time, if the weather is good, it will be dry; when a &s;econd mixture of the &s;ame kind &s;hould be laid on with a bru&s;h as before. When the &s;econd coat of painting is dry, the grea&s;e will not come off and the &s;urtout is an effectual pre&s;ervative from rain; it is very light to carry, and being pretty full on the back, will not only keep the man dry, but al&s;o his pack and ammunition.</P>
<P>The &s;leves are left long and wide, to receive the but end of a firelock (&s;ecured) and to cover it be|low the lock. The coat is double brea&s;ted to be lapped over, according to which &s;ide the rain drives. A man will be kept dry by one of the&s;e &s;urtouts as far as the knees. If, from the vicinity of the enemy, it is improper to make fires at night, he may place his pack on a &s;tone, and &s;itting upon it, change his &s;hoes and leggins, and, if he plea&s;es, wrap his blanket round his legs and feet, then draw|ing the watchcoat clo&s;e to his body, it will keep him warm, as no air can pa&s;s through it, and, lean|ing again&s;t the trunk of a tree, he may pa&s;s a tolerable night, both warm and dry.</P>
<P>It would be of &s;ervice to have a &s;mall piece of the &s;ame oiled linnen to put under the hat or cap to carry the rain down to the watchcoat or &s;urtout, otherwi&s;e whatever wet &s;oaks through the hat or cap, will run down the neck, and thereby in &s;ome mea&s;ure defeat the de&s;ign of the watchcoat.</P>
<P>Perhaps it might be u&s;eful to mix &s;ome dark or greeni&s;h colour with the oil of the &s;econd coating, to make the watchcoat le&s;s remarkable in the woods.</P></Q></NOTE> &s;urtout again&s;t the rain.

<P>I &s;aid that to compleat this e&s;tabli&s;hment they &s;hould have two troops of light hor&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ed of 50 men each, officers included. The men are to perform the &s;ame exerci&s;es as the foot, and afterwards be taught to ride, and particularly to be very alert at mounting and di&s;mounting with their arms in their hands, to gallop through the woods up and down hills, and leap over logs and ditches.</P>
<P>THE hor&s;es ought to be bought up on the frontiers, where they are bred and u&s;ed to feed in the woods, and are &s;trong and hardy. They are to be thorough|ly broke, made to &s;tand fire, to &s;wim over rivers, &amp;c. their &s;addles and accou|trements very &s;imple &s;trong and light. The number of hor&s;es might be reduced to one half, in time of peace, tho' they would be of little expence, as they might be bred and maintained without charge in the military &s;ettlement. This corps &s;hould be equiped as the foot, having only a &s;hort rifle in lieu of a fu&s;il, and a battle ax with a long handle, the only &s;ort of arms they &s;hould make u&s;e of in the charge.</P>
<P>EVERY light hor&s;e man ought to be provided with a Blood-hound, which would be u&s;eful to find out the enemies ambu&s;hes, and to follow their tracts; they would &s;eize the naked &s;avages, or at lea&s;t give time to the hor&s;e men to come up with them; they would add to the &s;afety of the camp at night by di&s;|covering any attempt to &s;urpri&s;e it.</P>

the ground laid out for that u&s;e in the woods, and at a good di&s;tance from the inhabitants. The nature of this &s;ettlement will hereafter be more particularly de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>NECESSITY creating indu&s;try, our young &s;oldiers will &s;oon provide them|&s;elves with the mo&s;t u&s;eful articles, and in a couple of years be able to rai&s;e provi&s;ions for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>WHILE the greate&s;t part would be employed in clearing the ground, fencing, ploughing, &s;owing, planting, building and making uten&s;ils and hou&s;hold furniture, others might hunt with their officers, and remain a fortnight or a month out of the camp, without other provi&s;ions than a little flour, and what they could procure by hunting and fi&s;hing: then to be relieved, and the whole trained up in that way.</P>
<P>THE military exerci&s;es mu&s;t &s;till be kept up and practi&s;ed, and great care taken to inculcate and pre&s;erve purity of manners, obedience, order and decency among the men, which will be found much ea&s;ier in the woods than in the neighbourhood of towns.</P>
<P>IN order to make this military e&s;tabli&s;hment more generally u&s;eful; I would propo&s;e that the &s;oldiers &s;hould only receive a very &s;mall part of their pay; leaving the remainder in the military che&s;t.</P>
<P>THEIR accounts &s;hould be &s;ettled every year, and when their &s;ervices &s;hould intitle them to their di&s;charge, I could wi&s;h that each of them had 200 acres of land given him, in a di&s;trict appropriated for that purpo&s;e; and receiving then the whole ballance of pay due to them, they would be enabled to compleat their &s;ettlement. This in&s;titution appears not only practicable, but ea&s;y, if attended to with patience, a&s;&s;iduity and firmne&s;s. The plan I would propo&s;e is as follows.</P>

<P>To reduce this exhorbitant number of hor&s;es, and the great expence attend|ing it, I would propo&s;e, for &s;uch parts of the country as would admit of it&punc; to make u&s;e of carts, drawn each by four oxen, and carrying about 1300 lb. or &s;ix barrels of flour.

<P>THIS method would not be as expeditious as the carriage by hor&s;es, and would require more time and attention in cutting the road, and bridging the &s;wampy places &amp;c; but, on the other hand, what an expence would be &s;aved! and by killing the oxen in proportion as the flour is u&s;ed, and abandoning the carts, the convoy is daily reduced, and the gra&s;s near the encampment will not be &s;o &s;oon con&s;umed, which is not the ca&s;e with hor&s;es, which mu&s;t equally be &s;ed though unloaded. This is an object of con&s;equence, particularly near the end of the campaign, when the &s;carcity of fodder obliges to move the camps every day, and to place them in low and di&s;advantageous grounds.</P>
<P>I WOULD therefore incline for the u&s;e of carts, and they could be made be|fore hand by the hunters and their artificers.</P>
<P>THE oxen &s;hould be bought in the provinces where the farmers make u&s;e of them in their works. One or two &s;oldiers would drive the cart and take charge of the four oxen.</P>

<P>IT is evident that, by this di&s;po&s;ition, the convoy is well cover'd, and the light troops, de&s;tined for the charge, remain concealed; and as all unexpect|ed events during an engagement are apt to &s;trike terror, and create confu&s;i|on, among the enemy, it is natural to expect that the &s;avages will be great|ly di&s;concerted at the &s;udden and unfore&s;een eruption, that will &s;oon pour upon them from the in&s;ide of the &s;quare; and that, being vigorou&s;ly attacked in front and flank at the &s;ame time, they will neither be able to re&s;i&s;t, nor, when once broke, have time to rally, &s;o as to make another &s;tand.

<HEAD>APPENDIX I. CONSTRUCTION OF FORTS AGAINST INDIANS.</HEAD>
<P>_AS we have not to guard here again&s;t cannon, the &s;y&s;tem of Eu|ropean fortifications may be laid a&s;ide, as expen&s;ive, and not an|&s;wering the purpo&s;e. Forts again&s;t Indians, being commonly remote from our &s;ettlements, require a great deal of room to lodge a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;tores and provi&s;ions, and at the &s;ame time ought to be defen&s;ible with one half of their compleat garri&s;ons, in ca&s;e of detach|ments or convoys.</P>
<P>I am therefore of opinion that a &s;quare or pentagon, with a block-hou&s;e of brick or &s;tone <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Experience has demon&s;trated that fortifications made of wood decay very &s;oon, and are on that ac|count of con&s;iderable expence.</NOTE> at every angle, joined by a wall flanked by the block-hou&s;es, would be the be&s;t defence again&s;t &s;uch enemies. A ditch from &s;even to eight feet deep might be added, with loop holes in the cellars of the block-hou&s;es &s;ix feet from the ground, to defend the ditch.</P>
<P>ALONG the in&s;ide of the curtains the traders might build hou&s;es and &s;tores, covered as well as the block-hou&s;es with tiles, or &s;late, to guard again&s;t fire arrows. There will remain a &s;pacious area for free air and u&s;e, in which as well as in the ditch, gardens might be made and wells dug.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="010167_0060_0F7D44EC255432B8">THE powder magazines might be placed in the center of the area, keeping only a &s;mall quantity of cartridges in each block-hou&s;e for pre&s;ent u&s;e.</P>
<P>THE garri&s;ons of &s;uch forts would be free from &s;urpri&s;es, even if they had no centries, for nothing can get at them, while the doors are well bolted and barred.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="reasons">
<HEAD>SOME REASONS FOR KEEPING POSSESSION OF OUR LARGE FORTS IN THE INDIAN COUNTRY.</HEAD>
<P>AS the&s;e forts have been one of the cau&s;es of the la&s;t war and area great eye-&s;ore to the &s;avages, they have bent their chief efforts again&s;t them; and therefore, while thus employed, they have been le&s;s able to di&s;tre&s;s our &s;ettle|ments. Our forts keep the Indian towns at a great di&s;tance from us. Fort-Pitt has effectually driven them beyond the Ohio, and made them remove their &s;ettlements at lea&s;t 60 miles further we&s;tward. Was it not for the&s;e forts, they would &s;ettle clo&s;e on our borders, and in time of war infe&s;t us every day in &s;uch numbers as would over-power the thin inhabitants &s;cattered on our exten&s;ive frontier. The farmer unable to &s;ow or reap would &s;oon fall back on our chief towns, or quit the country for want of bread. In either ca&s;e, what would be the fate of the large towns burthened with the whole country, and depriv'd of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance and of the materials of trade and export?</P>
<P>THE de&s;truction of the&s;e forts being, in time of war, the chief aim of the &s;avages, they gather about them to di&s;tre&s;s the garri&s;ons, and to attack the con|voys; thereby giving us an opportunity to fight them in a body, and to &s;trike a heavy blow, which otherwi&s;e they would never put in our power, as their ad|vantage lies in &s;urprizes, which are be&s;t effected by &s;mall numbers. Experience has convinced them that it is not in their power to break tho&s;e &s;hackles, and therefore it is not probable that they will renew the attempt; and our po&s;ts will continue a check upon them, and &s;ave the difficulty and expence of taking po&s;t again in their country. Our &s;orts are likewi&s;e the proper places for trade, which being clo&s;ely in&s;pected, it will be ea&s;y for us to limit their
<PB N="63" REF="010167_0061_0F7D44E531B91870">
&s;upplies, to &s;uch commodities as they cannot turn again&s;t us, and to put a &s;peedy &s;top to all ju&s;t cau&s;es of complaints, by giving immediate redre&s;s.</P>
<P>A FEW forts, with &s;trong garri&s;ons, I &s;hould judge to be of more &s;ervice than a greater number weakly guarded. In the la&s;t war we lo&s;t all our &s;mall po&s;ts: but our more con&s;iderable ones, Detroit and Fort-Pitt, re&s;i&s;ted all the efforts of the &s;avages, by the &s;trength of their garri&s;ons.</P>

<P>THE mo&s;t proper time of the year for going there, is the begining of Fe|bruary. The waters of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi are then high, and the country being overflowed, there is le&s;s to fear from the &s;avages, who are hunting in that &s;ea&s;on.</P>

<P>N. B. THE places mentioned in the three fir&s;t Routs are delineated in the foregoing map, by an officer who has an actual knowledge of mo&s;t of them, and has long &s;erved again&s;t the Indians. The fourth rout down the Ohio was given by an Indian trader, who has often pa&s;&s;ed from Fort-Pitt to the Falls; and the di&s;tances he gives of the mouths of the &s;everal rivers that fall into the Ohio may be pretty certainly depended on. Our maps hitherto publi&s;hed are very erroneous in placing &s;ome of tho&s;e rivers.</P>

<P>THE above li&s;t con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of &s;uch Indians as the French were connected with in Canada and Loui&s;iana. Wherever we knew the names by which the different nations are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Engli&s;h, we have in&s;erted them. But the Orthography is yet very un&s;ettled, and the &s;everal nations marked with an * A&s;teri&s;m are unknown to us, and therefore they are left as they &s;tand in the original li&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="010167_0069_0F7D44ED372A1200">So large a number of fighting men may &s;tartle us at fir&s;t &s;ight; but the ac|count &s;eems no where exaggerated, excepting only that the Catawba nation is now almo&s;t extinct. In &s;ome nations which we are acquainted with, the account falls even &s;hort of their numbers; and &s;ome others do not appear to be mentioned at all, or at lea&s;t not by any name known to us.</P>
<P>SUCH for in&s;tance are the Lower Creeks, of whom we have a li&s;t accord|ing to their towns. In this li&s;t their warriors or gun&s;men are 1180, and their inhabitants about 6000. Thus a comparative judgment may be formed of the nations above-mentioned; the number of whole inhabitants will (in this proportion to their warriors, viz. 5 to 1) be about 283,000.</P>
