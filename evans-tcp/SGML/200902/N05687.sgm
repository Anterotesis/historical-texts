We under&s;tood he Governour was tho'tful why the <HI>Narridgwock</HI> Indians were not here, We are al&s;o tho'tful, It is a Hindrance, &s;o far as we &s;hould be glad they &s;hould be &s;ent for again, We are of Opinion if they &s;hould be &s;ent for they would appear here forthwith, the Rea&s;on why we mention this is becau&s;e we would be very careful in what we do in our Pro|ceedings, that none &s;hould break in upon our Proceedings: We &s;hould be very &s;orry if any Thing &s;hould happen ami&s;s as to what we have done, We are not knowing that any are de&s;ign'd or intend to break our Treaty, but we are very tho'tful and Concern'd that none &s;hall do it. We in&s;i&s;t upon the removal of tho&s;e two Hou&s;es which was mentioned la&s;t Winter, we again make mention of them now, and if they were removed, there would be no Difficulty among the Tribes. We can't find any Record in our Memory, nor in the Memory of Our Grand-Fathers, that the <HI>Penob&s;cutt</HI> Tribe have Sold any Land, As to the Deeds mentioned la&s;t Winter, made by <HI>Medoccewanda</HI> and <HI>Sheep&s;out John,</HI> they were not <HI>Penob&s;cutt</HI> Indians, one belonging to <HI>Machias Medockewondo,</HI> the other towards <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> If we &s;hould find in reality that the Lands were Purcha&s;ed of the right Owners, we &s;hould not have in&s;i&s;ted upon it, nor have opened our Mouths, we would not pretend to tell a Lye about it, for we know that God will be angry with the Man that tells a Lye, We do not remember of any Settlements at <HI>St. George's,</HI> we remember a pretty while, and as long as we remember, the Place where the Garri&s;on &s;tands was fill'd with Great long grown Trees.

We have not heard any An&s;wer to our Letter about &s;ome Frenchmen killing &s;ome of our People a great Way up in the Country: We mention this becau&s;e the Governour told us if any Mi&s;chiefs or Injuries &s;hould happen, we &s;hould ac|quaint one another of it in order for Redre&s;s: We heard the Frenchmen were in Pri&s;on at <HI>Annapolis.</HI></P>
<P>The Lieut.

Governour, That His Maje&s;ty King GEORGE, by his Laws, did not allow his Governours to meddle with Matters out of their own Provinces, but that all &s;uch Facts mu&s;t be tried in the Governments wherein they were committed; and this being &s;aid to be done, not in our Government, but in that of <HI>Annapolis,</HI> the Lieut. Governour &s;aid he would &s;end the Frenchman back thither, where they might pro&s;ecute him, and that they would have a good Opportunity of doing it when they &s;hould go thither to receive the Ratification of that Government: To which the Indians replied, they were fully &s;atisfied, and content that it &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
