<NOTE PLACE="marg">See printed &s;pecial verdict page 11, 12.</NOTE> That L.

<P>Mr. LeGuen finding the &s;aid G. &amp; K. eva&s;ive and di&s;obliging in their conduct, and beginning to apprehend that they wi&s;hed to embarra&s;s him in the manage|ment of his property; in order to obtain an explicit avowal of their intentions <NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 23.</NOTE> wrote to them on the 30th May, after re|ferring

<P>Afterwards, but on the &s;ame day, an interview was had between LeGuen and G. &amp; K.&mdash;Mr. LeGuen repeated the in|junctions <MILESTONE N="24"> contained in his letter, a&s;ked an ab&s;tract of their account <HI>that he might &s;et|tle it to their entire &s;atisfaction and di&s;charge,</HI> and demanded a copy of the contract and an authorization to receive his money in Europe, repre&s;ented to them that the <HI>car|go <MILESTONE N="24"> was &s;pecially liable for the payments of the money due to him,</HI> and ought not there|fore to be burthened either with the <HI>freight money</HI> or <HI>premium of in&s;urance;</HI> and page

59 of the printed &s;pecial verdict, it ap|pears, that by the cu&s;toms of Normandy, which province includes Havre de Grace, the vendor has a lien for the purcha&s;e mo|ney on goods &s;old until again &s;old and de|livered, and that LeGuen might have pre|vented a removal of the goods from thence, if there was danger of lo&s;s. The &s;aid G. and K. neverthele&s;s di&s;regarded all the re|que&s;ts and injunctions of Mr. LeGuen, and even in his pre&s;ence <HI>encouraged the purcha|&s;ers to depart</HI> with the &s;hip White-Fox, and <MILESTONE N="24"> to di&s;po&s;e of the cargo <HI>as they plea&s;ed</HI>&mdash;and that the &s;aid Gomez actually &s;ailed with the &s;aid cargo in the &s;hip White-Fox on the following day.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="25"> On the 6th June Mr. LeGuen having received no an&s;wer to his letter of the 30th May, no one of his reque&s;ts or de|mands having been complied with, nor any account furni&s;hed to him; he writes again to G. and K repeating his former demands, urging the lo&s;&s;es and inconveni|ences to which he was expo&s;ed by their <MILESTONE N="26"> conduct; <HI>that they had even refu&s;ed to name an agent in Europe to take care of his</HI>

<HI>property,</HI> offers yet to co-operate with them, and propo&s;es to join with them in taking legal advice as to the &s;teps to be pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>To which G. and K. reply, by a letter of the &s;ame date, enclo&s;ing their account <MILESTONE N="27"> whereby they claim a balance of &pound;.6256 2<ABBR>s</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d</ABBR>, alledging that they are re&s;pon&s;ible for the charter money in &pound;.3733:6:8 and refu&s;ing to give him any authorization until they &s;hould be paid this imaginary balance, and &s;ecured for this voluntary guarantee.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame letter they intimate, that <MILESTONE N="28"> Mr. LeGuen's imagination is di&s;turbed with idle anxieties, that he had no cau&s;e for alarm, for that Gomez, Lopez and Riv|era are men of good characters and &s;uffi|cient re&s;pon&s;ibility, and that they (G. and K.) are di&s;po&s;ed to treat the &s;aid Gomez and Co. with delicacy throughout.</P>
<P>From the 6th to the 15th, Mr. LeGuen reiterated his demands with different mo|difications &mdash;Me&s;&s;rs. G. and K. continue to refu&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> talk of their advances and re&s;|pon&s;ibilities,

and, without making any fur|ther &s;pecific offers, in&s;i&s;t that they have a right <HI>to direct all the monies to be returned from <MILESTONE N="35"> Europe and to pa&s;s thro' their bands;</HI> and in their letter of 10th June &s;et up for the fir&s;t time, the penalty of 20,000 dollars con|tained in the contract as an additional rea&s;on why they refu&s;e to give the authorization.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40"> On the 15th June, Mr. LeGuen writes again to G. and K.&mdash;and after expre&s;&s;ing his chagrin that they have never given him any &s;pecific reply nor made him a &s;peci|fic propo&s;ition, he infers that they are <HI>de|termined at all events to retain his whole property until the winding up of the &s;pec|culation of Gomez and Co.</HI> That they wantonly deprive him of the benefit of the election to receive his money in Europe and defeat all his projects&mdash;He prote&s;ts a|gain&s;t this conduct, and demands for the <MILESTONE N="40"> la&s;t time that they forthwith <HI>furni&s;h him with an authenticated copy of the contract of &s;ale, and a competent authorization to re|ceive at the port of di&s;charge whatever &s;um &s;hall remain of the proceeds of the goods &s;old to Gomez and Co.&mdash;after fir&s;t deducting and</HI>

<P>To this letter G. and K. <HI>give no an&s;wer!</HI></P>
<P>That &s;undry other letters from the 1&s;t October 1795, to the 28th March, pa&s;&s;ed between the parties, and are &s;et forth in the &s;pecial verdict page 43 to 59.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="048502_0014_10258B0E19D4D2D0">
<MILESTONE N="53"> On the 11th of December, G. and K. offer to execute to either of three hou&s;es named by LeGuen at Hamburgh, a pow|er <HI>to make him to obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pro|ceeds <NOTE PLACE="marg">See LG's let|ter of 19 Dec. page 54 and that of G. and K. of 23. page 56.</NOTE> of the cotton and indigo on the condi|tion of giving them &s;ecurity for their claims again&s;t all contingent demands,</HI> to <HI>which LeGuen by a letter of the 15th of that month acceded;</HI> but, <HI>G. and K. afterwards de|clined to give effect to this their own propo&s;al.</HI></P>
<P>In a letter of the 2d Jan. G. and K. in|form LeGuen, that they were about to &s;end a power to <HI>Smith and Atkin&s;on of London,</HI> as it was probable the property would be removed to London, in&s;tead of Lubert and Dumas of Hamburgh, and <HI>that they would pur&s;ue the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps to touch as much of the money as could be done in Europe, not doubting of his approbation.</HI></P>
<P>In an&s;wer, Mr. LeGuen declines to a&s;|&s;ume any &s;pecial ri&s;k on the &s;ubject, <Q>&s;ee|ing that the going with the cargo from Hamburgh to London, changes e&s;&s;ential|ly <MILESTONE N="57"><MILESTONE N="58"> the nature and effect of the contract.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="048502_0015_10258B0FB693A248">
The jury have al&s;o found, that on the 6 June, '95, the &s;aid LeGuen was indebted to G. and K. in &pound;4795 6 3; that they had in their hands a cu&s;tom hou&s;e deben|ture, the property of the &s;aid Louis, pay|able in Augu&s;t following, for &pound;.4834 15, <HI>which would leave a balance of</HI> &pound;.39 8 10, <HI>due to the &s;aid L. LeGuen;</HI> but the jury <MILESTONE N="32"> farther &s;ay that G. and K. were entitled to a commi&s;&s;ion of &pound;60 8 10, on this de|benture, which would leave due to G. and K. <HI>twenty-one pounds and three pence,</HI> on the general balance of their account&mdash;That G. and K. received the amount of the debenture when it became due, and that the bonds which they entered into at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e were cancelled on the 1 April '96.</P>
<P>That G. and K. did not, at any time previous to the 1 Dec. '95, elect to receive the proceeds of the cotton and indigo in Europe&mdash;but did on the 22 Dec. elect to receive them in Hamburgh, and on the 2 Jan. '96, elect to receive them in London.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="048502_0016_10258B12A18A74D0">
That the re&s;ult of a careful examination of the facts found by the verdict is, that the advances and re&s;pon&s;ibilities of G. and K. for Mr. LeGuen, which they make the pre|text for detaining from him &s;o large a pro|perty, are reducible, the advances to the above trifling &s;um of <HI>twenty-one pounds and three pence,</HI> and the re&s;pon&s;ibilities to the bond given to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e for <HI>twelve thou&s;and and eighty-&s;ix dollars and eighty-&s;even cents,</HI> which was &s;ure to be cancelled upon producing evidence of the landing of the goods abroad. Neverthele&s;s, Gouver|neur &amp; Kemble had then actually received commi&s;&s;ions to the amount of three thou|&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty-two dollars and five cents.</P>
<P>That it does not appear from any thing contained in the &s;pecial verdict, nor is it to be inferred from any thing <HI>even offered to be proven,</HI> that G. and K. will be lo&s;ers; but con&s;idering <HI>the mon&s;trous benefit ari&s;ing from the u&s;e of &s;o large a &s;um of money</HI>&mdash;con&s;idering that they have at length &s;uc|ceeded in placing the property in the hands of their friends, Smith and Atkin&s;on, of

London&mdash;con&s;idering that, in the la&s;t re|&s;ort, Gomez &amp; Co. are, as alledged by G. and K. men of property and re&s;pon&s;ibility&mdash;con&s;idering al&s;o, that a recovery in this action by LeGuen, will ve&s;t the notes and property in Gouverneur and Kemble; it is fairly to be pre&s;umed, that they have &s;een and known how <HI>to &s;ecure not only an in|demnification, but profit by their mi&s;conduct.</HI></P>
<P>LeGuen neverthele&s;s very naturally de|termined to look to the re&s;pon&s;ibility of Gouverneur and Kemble, rather than to the proceeds of the goods, however &s;ufficient they might be, becau&s;e he knew the a&s;&s;ertion of his right to them, would &s;ubject them to &s;eque&s;tration by the Briti&s;h government, in con&s;equence of his character of <HI>Alien&mdash;Enemy.</HI></P>

THE COUNSEL for Louis LeGuen will urge and maintain,</P>
<P N="1">1. That every contract made by a factor for the &s;ale of goods is for the benefit of his principal, and forms a contract between the principal and the purcha&s;er, and that eve|ry contract made by a factor for <HI>his own benefit</HI> with the property of the princi|pal, is a violation of his duty and a fraud again&s;t the principal.</P>
<P N="2">2. That every factor is bound generally to obey the orders of his principal, and par|ticularly to u&s;e his endeavors to carry into effect any contract by him made for the be|nefit of his principal.</P>
<P N="3">3. That therefore, if a contract &s;hould &s;tipulate an advantage to depend on an election to be made, that election being it&s;elf a priviledge or benefit, is to be exer|ci&s;ed for the principal and is &s;ubject to his controul and direction.</P>
<P N="4">4. That in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the right of election to receive the purcha&s;e money
