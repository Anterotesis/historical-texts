The Marches, the Motions, the Stands, of the Armies pa&s;&s;ing thro' the Wilderne&s;s, were directed by the <HI>Sound.</HI> The <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> give <HI>Orders</HI> unto us; we are to take our <HI>Mea&s;ures</HI> from their <HI>Joyful &s;ound.</HI> People <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Joyful &s;ound,</HI> when they <HI>Under&s;tand</HI> the <HI>Go&s;pel;</HI> and per|ceive the <HI>Mind of the Lord.</HI> There are tho&s;e under the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> to whom our Lord &s;ays, as He once did unto His Di&s;ciples after Sermon; Matt. XIII. 51. <HI>Have ye under&s;tood</HI> all the&s;e things? And they can reply, <HI>Yea, Lord!</HI> We may &s;ay concerning the <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;|pel</HI> as was of old &s;aid concerning the <HI>Pauline</HI> Epi&s;tles; <HI>There are in them, &s;ome things hard to be under&s;tood.</HI> But there are People who
<PB N="12" REF="002246_0015_0FDAD82D80D6C860">do competently <HI>Under&s;tand</HI> them. They readily perceive the Language of the <HI>Trum|pets,</HI> about the whole <HI>My&s;tery of</HI> CHRIST, and the Homage that we owe unto Him; 'Tis not a <HI>Strange Language</HI> unto them.</P>
<P>O <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed People,</HI> who &s;o <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Joyful &s;ound!</HI> We remember the Speech of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> about the <HI>People which know not the Law,</HI>&mdash;How ju&s;tly to be &s;poken about the <HI>People,</HI> who <HI>Know not the Go&s;pel!</HI> But then, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed the People, who do know it!</HI> How it thunders, in I&s;ai. XXVII. 11. <HI>It is a People of no Under&s;tanding; Therefore He that made them will not have Mercy on them; He that formed them, will &s;hew them no Favour.</HI> But then on the other &s;ide; <HI>A People that Under&s;tand well the Joyful &s;ound, are a People that GOD has much Mercy for; much Favour for; A Peo|ple greatly Ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. There are People who <HI>E&s;teem</HI> the <HI>Joyful &s;ound.</HI> They &s;o <HI>Know</HI> it, as to <HI>Prize</HI> it; Set a va&s;t <HI>Price</HI> upon it. In the Bible, Words of <HI>Knowledge</HI> do &s;ignify &s;ome|times <HI>Affection</HI> too. Some &s;o <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Joy|ful &s;ound,</HI> as to be <HI>Well-affected</HI> unto it; Yea, to <HI>Prefer</HI> it above their <HI>Chiefe&s;t Joy.</HI> There are People, who had rather be with <HI>David,</HI> where they may <HI>hear what GOD the Lord &s;hall &s;ay</HI> unto them in the <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> of the

They count no <HI>Melody</HI> like that which is to be heard in the <HI>Courts</HI> of the Lord: And look|ing on the <HI>Silver Trumpets,</HI> they &s;ay, as he, P&s;al. XIX. 10. <HI>More to be de&s;ired are they, than much Fine Gold.</HI> They will &s;trive to have the <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> with them, whatever Expence of <HI>Silver,</HI> or anything el&s;e, it puts them to; They begrutch no co&s;t for it; Are Patient, tho' it co&s;t them the <HI>Bread of Adver|&s;ity,</HI> and the <HI>Water of Afflicton.</HI></P>
<P>O <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed People,</HI> who &s;o <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Joyful &s;ound!</HI> We are told, P&s;al. CXIX. 165. <HI>Great Peace have they that Love thy Law.</HI> If the <HI>Trumpets</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> have our <HI>Love,</HI> they will then &s;peak our <HI>Peace,</HI> cau&s;e our <HI>Peace.</HI> The <HI>Fruit</HI> of the <HI>Lips,</HI> that blow in tho&s;e <HI>Trumpets,</HI> is, <HI>Peace, Peace, and all the Ble&s;&s;ings of Goodne&s;s!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. There are People who <HI>Believe</HI> the <HI>Joyful &s;ound.</HI> We read of, the <HI>Good Seed, fal|ling into good and Hone&s;t Hearts;</HI> Thus there is the <HI>Good Sound coming into Good and Hone&s;t Ears.</HI> There are &s;ome, that find no <HI>Jarrs</HI> in the <HI>Sound</HI> of the <HI>Silver Trumpets;</HI> They rai&s;e no <HI>Di&s;putes</HI> about it; they &s;tart no <HI>Ca|vils</HI> upon it. It was a noble <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith;</HI> Act. XXIV. 14. <HI>I wor&s;hip GOD, Believing
<PB N="14" REF="002246_0017_0FDAD82E51B9EB08">all things, which are written in the Law and the Prophets.</HI> Thus, There are People who <HI>Live unto GOD,</HI> and <HI>Live by the Faith of the Son of GOD;</HI> And it is becau&s;e, they <HI>Believe all things that are Sounded in the Trumpets of the Go&s;pel.</HI> About the <HI>Trumpets</HI> that <HI>Sounded</HI> on <HI>Sinai,</HI> it was the per&s;wa&s;ion of the Godly People in all after ages; <HI>Lord, Thou &s;pake&s;t with them from Heaven, and gave&s;t them Right Judgments.</HI> Truly, In the <HI>Trumpets</HI> that we have <HI>Sounding</HI> from <HI>Zion,</HI> we have <HI>the Lord &s;peaking from Heaven unto us,</HI> and we have <HI>Right Judgments</HI> in them. This is the per|&s;wa&s;ion of the People that <HI>Know Right Judg|ments.</HI> They embrace the Go&s;pel, with <HI>Rea|&s;on &s;atisfied, and Faith e&s;tabli&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>O <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed People,</HI> who &s;o know the <HI>Joyful &s;ound!</HI> The <HI>Unbeliever</HI> is always under the Wrath of GOD. The portion of the <HI>Unbe|liever</HI> is for ever to be deprecated. But our Lord hath a&s;&s;ured us, Joh. XX. 29. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that have Believed.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. There are People that <HI>Obey</HI> the <HI>Joyful &s;ound.</HI> We are informed. 1 Joh. II. 4. <HI>He that &s;aith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar.</HI> There are &s;ome who &s;o <HI>Know,</HI> as to <HI>Do:</HI> They <HI>know practically,</HI> Their <HI>Knowledge</HI> has their <HI>Practice</HI> conform'd

<P>The <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation</HI> have now lo&s;t their <HI>Sil|ver Trumpets</HI> for the&s;e many Ages.

<P>Two Decads of Years, from the Beginning of this Colony, had not rolled away, before an Entrance was made upon this Work of PIETY; And our celebrated ELIOT, having with a <HI>Labour that overcometh all things,</HI> made him&s;elf the Ma&s;ter of a Language, wherein many of the Words are of <HI>Se&s;quipe|dalian,</HI> and <HI>Unaccountable</HI> Dimen&s;ions (One

<P>This <HI>Good Man</HI> had the <HI>Hand of the Lord</HI> with him; &amp; his Evangelical Attempts were &s;o ble&s;&s;ed of GOD, that anon (beyond what any <HI>Xavier</HI> could pretend unto!) <HI>Churches</HI> were formed among the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> and in an <HI>Holy Covenant</HI> they <HI>gave them&s;elves unto the LORD, and then unto one another,</HI> Engaging to Live in the Service of GOD, and carry on together the Wor&s;hip of our SAVIOUR, ac|cording to the Directions of the Go&s;pel. This was done, after <HI>Synods</HI> of <HI>Engli&s;h Chur|ches</HI> had &s;een <HI>Strict Examinations</HI> pa&s;&s;ed upon their Improvements in <HI>Experimental Piety,</HI> as well as their <HI>Knowledge in the My&s;tery of CHRIST.</HI> And an Eminent Per&s;on pre&s;ent at the&s;e <HI>Examinations,</HI> did then Publi&s;h to

Some of the&s;e Congregations, are not yet advanced unto all the Privileges of the <HI>E|vangelical Church-State.</HI> But a con&s;iderable Number are &s;o; and &s;ome <HI>New Churches</HI> were lately formed among them. I &s;uppo&s;e, Things are not very much altered, from what they were in this Account, which the la&s;t <HI>Vi&s;itation</HI> brought unto us. Very many Engli&s;h Witne&s;&s;es have been much affected with the Devotion, that they have &s;een ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> in their Publick Ex|erci&s;es of Religion; their <HI>Prayers</HI> formed with much of pertinency, and uttered with as much &s;olemnity; their <HI>Sermons,</HI> of Or|thodox Divinity, at the Hearing whereof, Children &s;carce a dozen Years old, readily turn to the Proofs; their <HI>P&s;almody,</HI> in which they out-do &s;ome of our <HI>Engli&s;h A&s;&s;emblies;</HI> and the <HI>Admonitions &amp; Excommunications,</HI> with
<PB N="39" REF="002246_0042_0FDAD8160F34E9F0">which they Cen&s;ure Scandalous Offenders. One that is at this time a Worthy Engli&s;h Mini&s;ter, but a Preacher to the <HI>Indians</HI> in their own Language al&s;o, has given in unto us, this Te&s;timony. <Q>Their Gravity, and diligent Attendance in the Time of Wor|&s;hip; with the Affectionate Confe&s;&s;ions of &s;uch as are admitted into the Church; make me hope, that many of them may have the Work of the <HI>Spirit</HI> wrought in them, <HI>according to the working of the Mighty Power of GOD.</HI> Their Method, re&s;pecting tho&s;e that are admitted into their Com|munion, is more according to the manner of the Churches in the Primitive Times, than is now practi&s;ed in mo&s;t parts. The Per&s;on to be Admitted, &s;tands forth in the mid&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly; and fir&s;t makes a <HI>Declaration</HI> of his <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and &s;ometimes de&s;ires <HI>Information</HI> in things mo&s;t arduous and doubtful. And then he makes a <HI>Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Sin;</HI> which they do, (as I have &s;een,) with <HI>Tears</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> like him in the <HI>Sixteenth</HI> Chapter of the <HI>Acts.</HI> And then he gives an Account of <HI>Experiences</HI> he has had, of Convictions, Awakenings and Comforts; in which they are large and particular. After which (much Coun&s;el and Exhortation to remain &s;tedfa&s;t in the
<PB N="40" REF="002246_0043_0FDAD85AA948C578"><HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Ways</HI> of the Lord, being given them by their <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Elder,</HI>) they are Admitted. I would, (and not ungrounded|ly) hope, That <HI>Additions are made unto the Church daily of &s;uch as &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> There are many, which maintain a Chri&s;tian Con|ver&s;ation, and are to be accounted, not <HI>Al|mo&s;t,</HI> but <HI>Altogether Chri&s;tians.</HI> And this does encourage the Preaching of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> to them; when we &s;ee, it plea&s;es GOD to make it, <HI>His Power unto Salvation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all of this, we mu&s;t humbly &s;ay, <HI>'Tis a Day of Small things.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> are not yet improved &s;o far into <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Civility, and Indu&s;try, and Husbandry, as were to be de&s;ired, and as a due Improve|ment in <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> would oblige them to. Many of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in&s;tead of giving them A&s;&s;i&s;tences and Encouragements, have rather contrived <HI>Indirect Ways</HI> to keep them under, and Entangle them in <HI>Debts</HI> unto them; and Vile Things have been done upon their <HI>In|&s;olvencies, Religion,</HI> 'tis to be fear'd, is under a Decay among them: Their <HI>Good Order</HI> lan|gui&s;hing: And the older and wi&s;er <HI>Indians</HI> going off, and Engli&s;h Neighbours too often hurting of the Survivors, much of that little <HI>Glory</HI> in which has been among them, &s;eems to have an <HI>Ichabod</HI> written upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="002246_0044_0FDAD816249182E0">
But what has of all things the mo&s;t Threat|ning A&s;pect upon them, is, The love of <HI>Strong Drink,</HI> which &s;trangely Captivates the <HI>Indians;</HI> in&s;omuch that <HI>very few</HI> are found A|ble wholly to re&s;i&s;t and conquer the Tempta|tion, when 'tis laid before them; and which, notwith&s;tanding the Prohibitions of the <HI>Law,</HI> finds ways of coming at them, that &s;eem al|mo&s;t Incurable; and which, where it has its operation, does confound all Religion, and every Valuable Intere&s;t. <HI>Rhum;</HI> That <HI>Branch</HI> of the <HI>River of Death;</HI> Alas, it threa|tens, more than any thing el&s;e, that we can think upon, to drown the <HI>Good Work,</HI> for which we are this day Signalizing our Solli|citude. <HI>Men of I&s;rael, Help!</HI> What, what &s;hall be done for the Help, of a Mi&s;chief, &s;o formidable, &s;o deplorable!</P>
<P>THIS is what I am in the Third Place arriv'd unto.

<P>I am not in&s;en&s;ible, that there are clamours now and then made as if your Small <HI>Revenue,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="002246_0045_0FDAD85D89E971F0">were not always applied unto the be&s;t <HI>Advan|tage;</HI> and as if your whole Affair were under a <HI>Defective Management.</HI> Yea, if the Glori|ous GOD had not almo&s;t <HI>Miraculou&s;ly</HI> ap|peared more than once to defeat the Plots of &s;ome de&s;igning Men, who Envied the Small Revenue which <HI>Our work</HI> has been kept alive withal, it had before now been diverted unto other purpo&s;es.

<PB N="43" REF="002246_0046_0FDAD817128AFE78">of a <HI>Good Work,</HI> which the <HI>Powers of Darkne&s;s</HI> will do all they can, to Encumber with ob|&s;tructions, that will require an uncommon <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Patience</HI> to Encounter them. The <HI>Ocean</HI> over which our Predece&s;&s;ors pa&s;&s;ed hither, was by Antiquity revered as leading to <HI>Holy and Ble&s;&s;ed Seats,</HI> and &s;omething of a <HI>more than Humane</HI> Character. Let us <HI>Do the Be&s;t we can,</HI> that it may be &s;o; and if we can|not rai&s;e our <HI>Indians</HI> up unto all the <HI>More than common</HI> Goodne&s;s that we are Striving for, yet let us come to it <HI>Our &s;elves,</HI> particu|larly in our Doing our Be&s;t for <HI>Them,</HI> that they may do &s;o. And whereas a Main In|tention which you now have in your View, is, To bring the Ri&s;ing Generation of the <HI>In|dians,</HI> unto a more general Under&s;tanding of the <HI>Engli&s;h Language,</HI> and more into the <HI>Eng|li&s;h way of Living,</HI> You will employ your fre|quent and earne&s;t <HI>Con&s;ultations</HI> upon it, and Call in the Advice of as many others, as may offer any <HI>Proper Methods,</HI> for the more Effectual Pro&s;ecution of it.</P>
<P>But as a Te&s;timony of your <HI>Zeal</HI> for this <HI>Good Work,</HI> and of the Sen&s;e which you have, that without the Influences of GOD our SA|VIOUR we <HI>can do Nothing</HI> to purpo&s;e, You are this Day pouring out your <HI>Prayers</HI> before Him. The&s;e <HI>Prayers</HI> are doubtle&s;s a <HI>Token
<PB N="44" REF="002246_0047_0FDAD8642230E248">for Good,</HI> that there may be &s;ome <HI>Re&s;erves of Mercy,</HI> for a Remnant of the mo&s;t Pitiable Ones, on who&s;e behalf we are now concerned. If but a <HI>Few</HI> of them, &s;hould be brought into a Sincere <HI>Love</HI> of GOD and of their <HI>Neigh|bour,</HI> and a Living <HI>Faith</HI> on our only SAVI|OUR, it will be richly worth all the Time and Co&s;t that has been laid out upon them all.

<P>While our Supplications to <HI>OUR Father</HI> are thus Engaged, we &s;hall Remember our dear Brethren, of the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Mi&s;&s;ion as far off as <HI>Malabar;</HI> the <HI>Good News</HI> of who&s;e amiable Enterprizes have been as <HI>cool waters to our Thir&s;ty Souls.</HI></P>
<P>I will recite a pa&s;&s;age in One of their Let|ters, becau&s;e we may make an Application of it unto our own Affair. <Q>Whenever the <HI>Sun</HI> ri&s;eth in the&s;e Ea&s;tern Parts of the World, it is always Surrounded with <HI>Thick Glouds;</HI> the common People of the <HI>Malabarians</HI> tell us, that the&s;e <HI>Clouds</HI> are huge overgrown <HI>Giants,</HI> thro' which the <HI>Sun</HI> every Morning mu&s;t fight his way, before ever it can appear
<PB N="45" REF="002246_0048_0FDAD81FCB180EB0">in its Compleat Lu&s;tre, and Brightne&s;s. This is a Fancy of the Vulgar Sort of our <HI>Mala|barians;</HI> But the Application we might make of it, will hold too True in every Re&s;pect, The <HI>Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> would fain begin to Ri&s;e, in the&s;e benighted parts of the World: But what Oppo&s;ition, what Contradiction, does this <HI>Sun</HI> meet with; even from tho&s;e who &s;hould help to re|move the <HI>Clouds</HI> and ob&s;tacles, which hi|therto have intercepted His <HI>Light</HI> and Ap|pearance, and this too, whil&s;t this <HI>Light</HI> but ju&s;t begins to break forth, and to appear in its fir&s;t Dawn and Morning Red? How|ever, 'tis to be hoped, that the <HI>Light</HI> will triumph at la&s;t over the <HI>Powers of Darkne&s;s,</HI> and &s;pread its Rays over all the Regions of Heatheni&s;m and Super&s;tition.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Excellent Things</HI> are done by tho&s;e Rare Men, in <HI>Laying a Foundation of True Chri&s;tia|nity</HI> among the <HI>Orientals,</HI> for the next Gene|ration to build upon, and Propagate a <HI>Religion</HI> which is not a meer <HI>External Thing</HI> that may render the Pro&s;elytes to it no better than <HI>Tinkling Cymbals,</HI> but that which &s;ets up the <HI>Kingdom of GOD</HI> in the SOUL, and aboli&s;hes the <HI>Image</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> and introduces the <HI>Image</HI> of our SAVIOUR, there.

<P>(1) THere are Glorious Maxims of PIETY, whereto our Great SAVIOUR will have the Hearts and Lives of His People conformed, that He may <HI>Receive them to the Glory of GOD.</HI> There are the <HI>Things which accompany Sal|vation;</HI> The Things which mu&s;t be found in all that &s;hall be <HI>Saved;</HI> and are no where found but in tho&s;e that &s;hall be <HI>Sa|ved;</HI> The Tempers and Actions of that <HI>Vital Piety</HI> wherein Men <HI>Live unto GOD.</HI></P>

<P>The Third is this;</P>

<Q><P>I can't but Entertain you on this occa&s;ion with another Charitable work, but of a very Singular Nature, and Extending it &s;elf as far as the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> In the Year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">705. Two Young Can|didates of Divinity, <HI>Bartholomew Ziegenbalgh,</HI> and <HI>Henry Plut&s;cho,</HI> Natives of <HI>Germany,</HI> were &s;ent by <HI>Frederick</HI> IV. the pre&s;ent King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> to attempt the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Malabar</HI>-Heathens there.

The Latter of the&s;e Languages, tho' exceeding Hard and Intricate, was, within Eight Months time, &s;o far Ma&s;tered by Mr. <HI>Ziegenbalgh,</HI> that he began to Preach to the <HI>Malabar</HI> Heathen in it, and by this Means, to Explain unto them the <HI>Method of Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>In Effect, GOD left not their Endeavours without a Ble&s;&s;ing: For &s;oon after, &s;ome of the&s;e Heathens being wrought upon by the Word of Salvation, did &s;hake off their Pa|gan Idolatry, and readily came over to Chri&s;tianity. And this hopeful Beginning proved a New Encouragement unto the&s;e
<PB N="58" REF="002246_0065_0FDAD8824C9E0AA0">Labourers, to go on with the work &s;o happi|ly &s;et on foot, tho' not without Toil and Difficulty.

<P>The Pagans were generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an utter Aver&s;ion to the Chri&s;tian Religion; and this for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they &s;aw &s;o much Impiety and Profanene&s;s abounding among tho&s;e that Call them|&s;elves by This Name. This was attended with many Con&s;equences. For no &s;ooner did an Heathen Embrace the Chri&s;tian Faith, but he was for ever bani&s;hed from all his former Goods and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and left to the wide World, to &s;hift for him|&s;elf. However, there were &s;ome other Im|pediments thrown in their way, far more Ob&s;tructive to the Propagation of the Go&s;|pel, than all what the Heathens could do to Oppo&s;e it. Tho&s;e Impediments were &s;tarted on the part of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> them|&s;elves, who&s;e Duty it had been to aid and &s;upport &s;o laudable an Undertaking.</P>

But in the mid&s;t of the&s;e Various ob&s;ta|cles, rai&s;ed Originally by the Common E|nemy of Souls, GOD was plea&s;ed to Excite many per&s;ons in <HI>Germany,</HI> to favour the Labours of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries; E&s;pecially after they were Convinced, with what Can|dour and Diligence they endeavoured to manage the work Committed unto their Tru&s;t. And truly, Con&s;iderable Sums of Money were required, for Settling and improving, the &s;everal Branches of this Con&s;titution.

<P>Then, For the mo&s;t frequent Conferences, which he maintained with the People, upon Salvation to be expected from CHRIST alone.</P>

<P>Tho&s;e Pre&s;ents of Gold from your young Gentlemen, I have Di&s;tributed unto the Youth in our Charity Schools. GOD the be&s;t Re|warder, will render to every one according to his Work.

For which cau&s;e, whatever is done among us, in Preaching, or in Teaching, or in Examining, or in our mo&s;t private Conferences, All &s;till is Entirely Levell'd at this Mark, that we may admoni&s;h and Excite and quicken Men, unto a True Repentance, unto a Living Faith, unto an Undi&s;&s;embled Piety; At the &s;ame time calling upon GOD with mo&s;t ardent Prayers, that He would thru&s;t forth &s;uch Mi&s;|&s;ionaries, who&s;e chief concern it &s;hall be, that the Sheep may be led unto that be&s;t of Pa&s;tures, which is with JESUS CHRIST, and be refre&s;hed from none but the pure Fountain of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>Daily Experience has hitherto taught us, that by the advantage of <HI>Catechi&s;ts,</HI> we may
<PB N="82" REF="002246_0110_0FDAD9200C7CA7C0">do very much Good, not only upon the Members of the Church them&s;elves, but al&s;o upon tho&s;e that are without. Wherefore upon the Ob&s;ervation of This, we do all we can, that by the Word of Truth we may pre|pare &s;uch Catechi&s;ts for us, who having a Good Foundation laid in the Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, may both arrive to a Spi|ritual Experience, and may be made fit from hence to teach others in the Doctrine of JE|SUS CHRIST, and give them a Lively De|mon&s;tration of it. We have Seven &s;uch Ca|techi&s;ts, with whom we manage, a <HI>Biblical Exerci&s;e,</HI> an <HI>Exegetical,</HI> and a <HI>Theological.</HI></P>
<P>For the <HI>Biblical</HI> Exerci&s;e, we take &s;ome whole Book, of the New Te&s;tament; where|in we &s;how them, what Parts are in every Chapter; Afterwards we go thro' the Parts; and the Catechi&s;ts them&s;elves fetch out from thence, certain Doctrines joyned with &s;ome Application of them. But when they come to Declare things, they proceed after this manner. Fir&s;t, they Expound the Mat|ters, and the Context. Then, This being done, they apply to the proper Edification of the Soul, tho&s;e things that appear to be mo&s;t Sub&s;ervient unto it. But by this Method, that which is principally aimed at, is, partly that they may get a more Solid, and a Stable
<PB N="83" REF="002246_0112_0FDAD9214B9F3458">Knowledge of the Truth, out of the Sacred Scriptures; and partly that they may get into a greater Ability for Preaching when they &s;hall have Opportunity to Speak any where, yea, anon to propound the Truth of GOD among the Nations.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Exegetical</HI> Exerci&s;e, we hitherto handle only particular Sentences of the Bi|ble; wherein &s;upplying them with an Expo|&s;ition according to the Rules of Interpreta|tion, we fetch out certain Po&s;itions which are to the point in hand; and when we have in &s;ome orderly manner opened &s;uch a Sentence; they taking Notes hereof in writing, we leave them to their own Meditations. Whence it commonly comes to pa&s;s, that the Things which they have thus Meditated by them&s;elves, they recite by Heart on the Lords|day, and offer them as a Sermon for the Publick.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Theological</HI> Exerci&s;e, we &s;how them fir&s;t the Fundamental The&s;es, in all the Ar|ticles of our Faith: And then we bring the &s;tronge&s;t Proofs for them, from Sentences of the Scripture. And that we may &s;erve this End the better, we have written a certain Compendium of Divinity, of an <HI>Octavo</HI> form, in the Tongue of this <HI>Damulic</HI> Nation.</P>

<P><HI>The pre&s;ent Condition of the</HI> Indians <HI>on</HI> Martha's Vineyard, <HI>Extracted from an Account of Mr.</HI> Experience Mayhew, <HI>newly Publi&s;hed; From whence the pre&s;ent Condition of the re&s;t may be apprchended.</HI></P>
<P>COncerning the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Indians</HI> on the&s;e I&s;lands, and places adjacent on the Main, there was a brief Narrative writ|ten by <HI>Matthew Mayhew,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Elde&s;t Son of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Thomas Mayhew,</HI> who fir&s;t Preached the Go&s;pel unto them; which Narrative was Prin|ted at <HI>Boston</HI> in the Year 1694. and Reprinted at <HI>London</HI> the next Year, under the Title of, <HI>The Con|quest and Triumphs of Grace,</HI> &amp;c. The &s;ame for Sub|&s;tance, being again Printed &s;ome Years after, in Dr. <HI>C. Mather</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall begin my Account of the State of the <HI>In|dians</HI> from the time the &s;aid Book was fir&s;t Publi&s;h|ed, that being about the time that I fir&s;t began to Preach to them.</P>
<P>The Number of <HI>Indians</HI> on the&s;e I&s;lands is very much dimini&s;hed, &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fir&s;t &s;ettled on <HI>Martha's Vineyard,</HI> which was in the Year 1642, there being then as was &s;uppo&s;ed on that I&s;land about 1500 Souls. At pre&s;ent there are in the <HI>Vineyard</HI> &s;ix &s;mall Villages, containing in all of them, about 155 Families, and the Number of Souls may be about eight hundred.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e Villages is provided with an <HI>Indi|an</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="002246_0122_0FDAD93802FDABB8">Preacher to di&s;pence the Word to them on the Lord's Days, when I am not with them. They meet for the Wor&s;hip of GOD twice a Day on the Sabbath, and after Prayer, &s;ing a P&s;alm; then there is a Sermon Preached on &s;ome Portion of Scrip|ture, which being ended, they &s;ing again, while the Days be of a &s;ufficient length; and then con|clude with Prayer.</P>
<P>There has, from time to time, been much care taken that the &s;everal Villages might be provided with School Ma&s;ters to teach the Children to Read and Write; yet &s;ome of them have not been &s;o con&s;tantly &s;upplied, as is to be de&s;ired; and gene|rally when the Spring of the Year comes on, the Indians take their Children from School, alleging they want them for Tillage of the Land; and &s;o the Schools fail till the Fall; and this has much hindred their Progre&s;s in Learning: Neverthele&s;s, I think the greate&s;t number can Read, either in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or in the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue; and &s;ome in both.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o care taken to <HI>Catechi&s;e</HI> the Youth: For be&s;ides what is done in this kind, by the <HI>Indian</HI> School-Ma&s;ters &amp; Preachers, I frequently examine the Young People my &s;elf, and have determined to attend this Service once a Fortnight, in &s;ome or other of the forementioned Villages; and this Me|thod will, I hope, prove very advantageous: many grown People as well as Children, attending the&s;e Exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Church at <HI>Marth</HI>'s-<HI>Vineyard,</HI> whereof Mr. <HI>Japhet Hannit</HI> an excellent <HI>Indian Mini&s;ter</HI> was formerly the Pa&s;tor, but died in the Year 1712, had after his Death another Pa&s;tor, called <HI>Sowomog:</HI> but he being an Old Man when he was fir&s;t called
<PB N="90" REF="002246_0123_0FDAD9732AFEF540">unto that Office, lived but a very few Years.</P>
<P>The Name of the pre&s;ent Pa&s;tor of that Church is <HI>Joa&s;h Pann,</HI> who is a very &s;erious prudent and pious Man, of a good Conver&s;ation, and one who drinks no &s;trong drink, but is much grieved at tho&s;e of his Country-men who do err by means of it. If it plea&s;e GOD to continue his Life, he is like to prove a good In&s;trument; but being lately fallen into a Langui&s;hing Di&s;temper, I fear what the i&s;&s;ue of it may be.</P>
<P>The number of Communicants, both Men and Women, in this Church, is about 110. The mo&s;t of the&s;e are Inhabitants of <HI>Martha's-Vineyard,</HI> but not all; there being a few that have joyned them&s;elves there unto, not only from <HI>El&s;abeth</HI>'s I&s;lands, but from the Main Land al&s;o, lying next unto the <HI>Vineyard.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord's Supper is ordinarily Admini&s;tredin that Church about 7 or 8 times in a Year, and Di&s;|cipline is in &s;ome mea&s;ure kept up in it. Unto this End, be&s;ides other Church Meetings, there is con&s;tantly on the <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> or <HI>Friday</HI> before that Sa|crament is Admini&s;tred, a Meeting of the Church, wherein &s;uch are &s;u&s;pended from the Lord's Table as having been over-taken in any fault, have not given due &s;atisfaction. At this Meeting al&s;o there is ordinarily a Sermon Preached &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that as the <HI>Indians</HI> are many of them much addicted unto &s;trong drink; &s;o &s;ome of the Members of the Indian Church have been &s;ometimes found very faulty, on this account; yet it is al&s;o true, that &s;uch as the&s;e have generally appeared very Penitent. And tho' &s;ome have fallen quite away, and &s;o have been cut off by the Sword
<PB N="91" REF="002246_0124_0FDAD939DE45EC78">of Di&s;cipline; yet others thro' the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace of GOD, have been &s;o far recovered out of the Sins into which they have fallen, as that it may be hoped they will not again return to them; and there have all along been, and &s;till are, a con&s;iderable number, who&s;e Conver&s;ation is, &s;o far as I can under&s;tand, very blamele&s;s, and who may be ju&s;tly looked upon as Exemplary Chri&s;tians; what ever &s;uch <HI>Engli&s;h Men</HI> as are filled with Prejudices again&s;t the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> may &s;ay to the contrary.</P>
<P>Some Years after I fir&s;t began to Preach to the <HI>Indians,</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> on <HI>Martha's Vineyard,</HI> did on a day of <HI>Fa&s;ting &amp; Prayer</HI> appointed for that End, &s;o|lemnly renew their Covenant with GOD, engaging to endeavour to for&s;ake tho&s;e Sins with which they confe&s;&s;ed they were too ea&s;ily be&s;et; and there was after this, for a Time, &s;ome Reformation: but I ob|&s;erved that two or three of the Brethren that could not be per&s;waded to joyn in the Action, &s;oon after fell into Scandalous Mi&s;demeanours.</P>
<P>I al&s;o ob&s;erved, That after the Church had thus renewed their Covenant, the Means of Grace offered unto the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;eemed for a time to be attended with more of the Pre&s;ence of GOD, and the Influ|ences of His Spirit, than they were before, or have been &s;ince.</P>
<P>It was then frequent to &s;ee Per&s;ons at the Hear|ing of Sermons, very much affected, and &s;ome times as &s;oon as Sermon was ended, there would &s;tand up &s;everal, one after another, and make very Penitential Confe&s;&s;ions of their Sins, with Promi&s;es to endea|vour to Live new Lives: de&s;iring al&s;o the Prayers of the People of GOD for them.</P>
<P>About this time there joyned in full Communion
<PB N="92" REF="002246_0125_0FDAD97549043270">unto that &s;mall Church on the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> in one Year, at lea&s;t 30 Per&s;ons, the behavour of many of whom did very much re&s;emble that of the Jailor, at his Conver&s;ion, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. GOD &s;hewing us herein that He can make the <HI>Indians</HI> as well as Others a <HI>willing People in the Day of His Power.</HI></P>
<P>There is an Increa&s;e of Knowledge among the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that their progre&s;s herein is but &s;low, by rea&s;on of the want of a Learned Mini&s;try con&s;tantly to In&s;truct them. Their ordi|nary Preachers having but little Learning, and are not &s;o able to &s;eed them with Knowledge &amp; Under|&s;tanding as is to be de&s;ired; yet &s;ome of the&s;e have Gifts not to be de&s;pi&s;ed in <HI>a day of &s;mall things.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Mini&s;ters as they are Members in full Communion of the Church on the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> &s;o they do not engage in the work of the Mini&s;try without the Con&s;ent &amp; Approbation of that Church, as well as of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters that Preach unto the <HI>Indians,</HI> and have an In&s;pection over them.</P>
<P>Having now Preached to the <HI>Indians</HI> upward of 25 Years, I have never yet had any &s;pecial charge of any one &s;ingle Congregation committed to me; but have vi&s;ited the &s;everal fore mentioned A&s;&s;em|blies alternately, as I have thought mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary; Preaching ordinarily, unto &s;ome or other of them every Lord's Day, and on working days once a Fortnight; con&s;tantly al&s;o attending their Church-Meetings, to a&s;&s;i&s;t &amp; direct them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> when they are Sick, generally &s;end for their Mini&s;ters, and &s;ometimes other Chri&s;tians with them, to vi&s;it them, and Pray with, and for them. I have &s;ome times been with them on &s;uch occa&s;ions, and heard them profe&s;s a great concern
<PB N="93" REF="002246_0126_0FDAD9440516BC00">about their Souls; declaring that they did not re|gard any thing in this World, &s;o they might obtain an Intere&s;t in GOD's Favour; and I have known many of them who have profe&s;&s;ed a good hope thro' CHRIST in their Death, and who have behaved them&s;elves on all accounts as does become dying Saints; nor have I any doubt, but that many of them have died in the Lord.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ah Torrey,</HI> Pa&s;tor of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church in <HI>Tisbury</HI> on the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> has al&s;o for many Years pa&s;t Preached as a Lecturer unto the <HI>Indians</HI> on that I&s;land, having for that End learned their Language. He Preach|eth in &s;ome or other of their A&s;&s;emblies once a Fort|night, and goes frequently to their Church-Meetings, to advi&s;e &amp; a&s;&s;i&s;t them; &s;o that the <HI>Indians</HI> have a Ser|mon every <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Preached to them, either by Mr. <HI>Torrey,</HI> or my &s;elf: And we &s;trengthen the hands of one another, by going together to the&s;e Weekly Exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. <HI>Samuel Wi&s;wall</HI> Pa&s;tor of the Church in <HI>Edgartown,</HI> has al&s;o now almo&s;t learned the <HI>Indians</HI> Tongue, with a de&s;ign to do what Service he can a|mong that People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> on <HI>Martha's-Vineyard</HI> &amp; the adjacent I&s;lands, do hitherto under&s;tand the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue much better than that of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and therefore complain much for want of <HI>Indian</HI> BIBLES, having now but very few among there. Nor are there any to be had; the la&s;t Edition being now gone. The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> are therefore very de&s;irous of mother Impre&s;&s;ion of the BIBLE, if it might be obtained; and divers of hem have told me, as well as &s;ome of tho&s;e on <HI>Nantucket,</HI> (whom I have divers times vi&s;ited) that they &s;hould be willing accor|ding to their capacity, to contribute to it.</P>
<P>But the di&s;advantage which the <HI>Indians</HI> are under thro' the Scarcity of BIBLES is &s;ome what helped by the Care of the Honourable Commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;upply them with other u&s;eful Books in their own Language, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>N. England</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith; Several Catechi&s;ms;

And the <HI>Indian</HI> Primer Printed this Year, in <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> All which Books are now very u&s;eful unto them.</P>
<P>As to their Civil Government, the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Dukes</HI> County, (as well as in other Places) are wholly under the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> But becau&s;e their State does yet &s;omewhat differ from that of their <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Neighbours, there are &s;e|veral Laws made by the General Court of this <HI>Province,</HI> with a particular regard to the <HI>Indian</HI> Inhabitants of the &s;ame: And there are &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ju&s;tices e&s;pecially Commi&s;&s;ionated to take care of the <HI>Indians</HI> Inhabiting the &s;everal Counties of it: and <HI>the&s;e</HI> are directed to No|mainate and Appoint &s;everal Officers among the <HI>Indians</HI> them&s;elves, to a&s;&s;i&s;t under their regulation, in the Government of that People.</P>
<P>There are yet but few <HI>Indians</HI> on <HI>Martha's. Vineyard</HI> that have Hou&s;es of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion, tho' the number of the&s;e is of late increa&s;ed; but in re&s;pect of their Apparel, they are generally Cloathed as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are, &amp; they by degrees learn the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> way of Husbandry: Several of them have good Teams of Oxen, with which they Plough and Cart, for them&s;elves &amp; Neighbours, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> do. Many of them have al&s;o <HI>Hor&s;es, Cows, Sheep &amp; Swine.</HI> They have al&s;o among them &s;ome that have learned Trades; as at <HI>Martha's-Vineyard</HI> there are &s;everal <HI>Weavers,</HI> One or two <HI>Hou&s;e-Carpenters,</HI> One <HI>Wheel-wright,</HI> who is &s;o good a Work-man, as to be frequently employed by his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Neighbours.
