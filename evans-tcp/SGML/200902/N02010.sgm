<P>THE Art of Printing (invented, but about two hundred Years &s;ince) has been a <HI>va&s;t Service</HI> to Religion and Learning. Hence, the <HI>Statesman,</HI> the <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> the <HI>Mechanick,</HI> yea, the <HI>Ladies,</HI> as well as the <HI>Scholar,</HI> the <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> the <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and the <HI>Divine</HI> are furni&s;hed with <HI>agreeable Libraries.</HI> And tho' 'tis matter of La|mentation, that this excellent Art, has been abu&s;ed, (as <HI>Mu&s;ick, Poe&s;y,</HI> and other Arts have al&s;o been,) to the Di&s;honour of <HI>Almighty GOD,</HI> the Scandal of Religion, the hardning of the wicked, and the grief of Wi&s;e and Good Men: yet the Reformed Churches, and particularly our Nation, and Land have great cau&s;e to be thankful for this noble In|vention; they being hereby richly &s;upply'd (not only with various other u&s;eful Books, but) with great plenty of very excellent Sermons, Expo&s;itions of Scripture, Sy&s;tems of Divinity, and the like; by which, (as many of the eminent Servants of God <HI>being dead, yet &s;peak unto us;</HI> &s;o many other worthy Per&s;ons, and e&s;pecially) the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are &s;till ble&s;t with Opportunities of rendring their U&s;efulne&s;s more <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> and

For tho' I'm per|&s;waded we may be <HI>too forward</HI> to appear in Print; and am &s;ure that the <HI>&s;uppre&s;&s;ion</HI> of &s;ome things I've &s;een would have contributed as much, or more to the Honour of the Authors, their Country &amp; Religion, than the <HI>Publication</HI> of them: yet I verily believe that &s;ome good &amp; great <HI>Divines,</HI> who have been and are among&s;t us, have been too <HI>&s;hy, mode&s;t</HI> and <HI>re&s;erv'd,</HI> and made them&s;elves too far guilty of <HI>hiding their Talent in a Napkin,</HI> whil&s;t they've withheld from us what is <HI>more precious than Gold!</HI> And truly it's my humble Opinion, that we had much better hear with &s;ome <HI>feeble E&s;&s;ays &amp; weak Births</HI> from the Pre&s;s, (which we are under no obligation in the World to patronize, admit under our ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f, or touch with one of our Fingers,) than by <HI>ra&s;h cen&s;uring</HI> &s;uch hone&s;t well|meant Compo&s;ures, <HI>&amp; &s;coffing</HI> at the Authors thereof, take an unhappy method to deprive our &s;elves of the plea&s;ure &amp; advantage of peru&s;ing many other more entertaining Meditations, &amp; Di&s;cour&s;es, by thus tempting the worthy Authors of them (that they may e&s;cape the &s;courge of the tongue, to refu&s;e expo&s;ing them to publick view.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I think that as the <HI>Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel</HI> (of which Order, I confe&s;s my &s;elf the mo&s;t unworthy) &s;hould &s;ee, that they have a <HI>Call of God,</HI> to <HI>Preach</HI> in this or that Place; and when they are &s;atisfy'd there|in &s;hould not be di&s;courag'd on any &s;core whatever: &s;o when PROVIDENCE calls them to <HI>Publi&s;h</HI> their Sermons, or other Writings, (and <HI>Wi&s;dom is pro|fitable to direct</HI> them in judging of this, they ought
<PB N="iii" REF="002388_0005_0FDB353B9F308AF8">unque&s;tionably to do it, <HI>and leave the Event with GOD.</HI> For my own part I do &amp; will (relying upon Divine Aids) govern my &s;elf by this <HI>Rule.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> all I &s;hall &s;ay is; that I fir&s;t Studied it <HI>for,</HI> and Preach'd it <HI>to</HI> my own People, without the lea&s;t tho't of it's being made Pub|lick, (it being partly occa&s;ioned by a mo&s;t unhappy and unrea&s;onable Controver&s;y about <HI>Singing by Note;</HI>) and having offer'd it in two other Congre|gations, where I was &s;oon after called to Preach; I at length delivered it at <HI>your Lecture;</HI> where &s;un|dry of my Brethren in the Mini&s;try were pre&s;ent, who expre&s;s'd their Approbation of it; and &s;everal among&s;t you de&s;iring it might be publi&s;hed, I at length con&s;ented to it; partly to <HI>make you &s;ome amends</HI> for not gratifying your de&s;ires of &s;everal Sermons, you &s;ome Years &s;ince by repeated Votes ask'd of me; and partly becau&s;e I perceive <HI>it was not ac|ceptable</HI> to &s;ome in who&s;e bearing it was preached: who will, I hope, do <HI>me</HI> the <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> and <HI>them&s;elves</HI> the <HI>Honour</HI> to change their minds about it, (if they'l vouch&s;afe to give it the reading,) and repent of the <HI>ill Temper</HI> they were in, when it was delivered to them in the Name of GOD from the <HI>Sacred Desk.</HI> However, I remember what is &s;aid of the bearers of the mo&s;t celebrated Preacher that ever was (the Son of God only excepted) that &s;ome <HI>believed,</HI> &amp; &s;ome <HI>believed not, Act. 28.24.</HI> But the chief Rea&s;on (I hone&s;tly profe&s;s) of my printing the following Di&s;cour&s;e is, becau&s;e I judge that (&s;uch as it is) <HI>it's needful,</HI> and may (if God plea&s;e to ble&s;s it) be <HI>u&s;eful</HI> among&s;t us in this part of the Country, and

<P>And Nathanael &s;aid unto him, Can there my good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip &s;aith unto him, Come and &s;ee.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IN the Text before us, there are Two things Ob&s;ervable. Fir&s;t, A Doleful Effect of Prejudice. Secondly, A proper Remedy pref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ib'd, for the Care of it.</P>
<P N="1">Fir&s;t, We've a doleful Effect of Prejudice, in the former part of the ver&s;e; <HI>Natha|niel</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?</HI> Where,</P>
<P>Ob&s;. 1. THE Per&s;on under the Influence of Prejudice. His name was <HI>Nathanael,</HI> But who he was is uncertain. How|ever, we know, that he was a very Good Man. Our Ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour Him&s;elf, bare witne&s;s of him; that He was an I&s;raelite indeed, v. 47. He was a Man of great Integrity, both in the Sight of GOD and Man: A Man, in whole Spi|rit there was no Guile. i. e. None Allowed; none Reign|ing: none Imputed. This was <HI>Nathanael</HI>'s Character, who was notwith&s;tanding in &s;ome mea&s;ure under the Power of Prejudice. But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. LET us con&s;ider, What this Excellent Man, was pre|juc'd again&s;t, or with Relation to. It was not again&s;t any Maxim in Philo&s;ophy. That had been no great Wonder, for there are Multitudes of Good Men that are no Philo&s;o|phers,
<PB N="2" REF="002388_0008_0FDB35418AB83788">and are not capable of Judging of Ab&s;tru&s;e points in Philo&s;ophy. It was not again&s;t any incon&s;iderable Per&s;on, who had by his Irregularities, in a great mea&s;ure &s;orfeited his Credit, with this good Man. No! But,</P>
<P>1 HE was Prejudic'd again&s;t the Greate&s;t Truth of Re|vealed Religion, Even this; <HI>That Je&s;us of Nazareth i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the True Me&s;&s;iah. Philip</HI> being called by Chri&s;t to be an Apo&s;tle, and finding <HI>Nathanael;</HI> tells him, that they had <HI>found Him of whom Mo&s;es in the Law and the Prophets did write, Je&s;us of Nazareth the Son of Jo&s;eph,</HI> i. e. The Me&s;&s;iah; The Con&s;olation of I&s;rael, whom many were then ju&s;tly expecting. But <HI>Nathanael</HI> could not receive this Truth. He believed in the Me&s;&s;iah, Who, he thought was yet to come: But did not believe, that Je&s;us was He. hence he was prejudic'd again&s;t the Greate&s;t and Be&s;t Man that ever was in the World, even the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Not believing Him to be the Me&s;&s;iah, as indeed He was; He mu&s;t needs e&s;teem Him a Grand Impo&s;tor. Hence al&s;o, he was prejudic'd again&s;t the Greate&s;t Dety in Chri&s;tianity, even that, of Receiving Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Thus Chri&s;t came to His own, and (for the pre&s;ent) His own received Him not. <HI>Nathanael</HI>'s Prejudice, &s;o blinded his mind, that he could &s;ee no Form nor Comeline&s;s in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is Fairer than the Children of Men, even altogether Lovely: He could by no means believe Him to be the Me&s;&s;iah, and hence di&s;putes again&s;t believing in Him.</P>
<P>IT is then, no New thing, for Real Saints to be preju|dic'd for a Time and in a Degree, again&s;t &s;ome of the Be&s;t Men in the World, yea, again&s;t &s;ome of the mo&s;t Impor|tant Truths and Duties of Religion.</P>
<P>Ob&s;. 3. THE <HI>true</HI> Rea&s;ons of <HI>Natbanael</HI>'s Prejudice a|gain&s;t Chri&s;t; or, whence it was, that he laboured of &s;uch Prejudice. Now this was owing partly, to <HI>Nathanael</HI>'s Ig|norance and Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion: And partly, to <HI>Philip</HI>'s Defectivene&s;s in preaching Chri&s;t to <HI>Nathanael.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. HIS Prejudice aro&s;e from his Ignorance and wrong Notion of the Me&s;&s;iah. For, <HI>One Ab&s;urdity admitted, is productive of many others.</HI> Can any good thing come out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">areth? q. d. <Q>Can any worthy Excellent Per&s;on,
<PB N="3" REF="002388_0009_0FDB3545B1144CF0">Can the Promi&s;ed &amp; long-expected Me&s;&s;iah come out of &s;uch an ob&s;cure, contemptible Place as Nazareth?</Q> And out of a Place of which the Scripture did not make men|tion, as whence the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould ari&s;e. The People made the &s;ame Objection. <HI>Chap.</HI> 7.41. Shall Chri&s;t come out of Galilee? <HI>Nathanael</HI> con&s;idering the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of the Place, and not having a right notion of the Doctrine of Chri&s;t's Humiliation, and Expecting (as the Jewi&s;h Church did) a Temporal Saviour, be was Prejudic'd again&s;t Je&s;us of Nazareth and could not at pre&s;ent, believe Him to be the Me&s;&s;iah, and as &s;uch receive Him.</P>
<P N="2">2. BUT then, His Prejudice was occa&s;ion'd partly, by the Defective Account <HI>Philip</HI> gave him, of our Saviour. <HI>Na|thanael</HI> was a Man, well acquainted with his Bible no doubt: A Man that had &s;earched the Scripture and under&s;tood from thence, that according to <HI>Mic.</HI> 5.2. the Me&s;&s;iah was to be born in Bethlehem, and not in Nazareth, or Galilee. Now &s;ome think that <HI>Philip</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed Chri&s;t to be born at Naza|reth, and that He was really the Son of <HI>Jo&s;eph;</HI> and hence, fell in, with the Vulgar way of &s;peaking, calling our Saviour (as He was U&s;ually termed) Je&s;us of N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zareth, the Son of <HI>Jo&s;eph.</HI> Note hence.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Vulgar Expre&s;&s;ions are &s;ometimes very impro|per, and founded on great Mistakes.</HI> Indeed, had <HI>Philip</HI> throughly under&s;tood him&s;elf, and having &s;poken in the Popular Stile, had he expounded him&s;elf, and inform'd <HI>Na|thanael,</HI> that Chri&s;t was born in Bethlehem, though called Je&s;us of Nazareth, becau&s;e that was the Place of His Re&s;i|dence, or, for any other &s;ufficient rea&s;on: And that He was really the Son of GOD, though called the Son of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> becau&s;e he was the Husband of His Mother, the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin; He might po&s;&s;ibly have prevented <HI>Nathanael</HI>'s Pre|judice, and obviated his Objection, again&s;t Chri&s;t. But it may be he was him&s;elf ignorant in the&s;e Points. And his Defect may teach the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel to u&s;e their utmo&s;t Di&s;cretion, that they may anticipate any weighty Objection, that might ari&s;e in the minds of their Hearers: And to take heed, they don't beget or confirm Prejudices in their minds, again&s;t the Truth, by an over-popular and
<PB N="4" REF="002388_0010_0FDB3546CE1869E8">unguarded way of Expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, and by not u&s;ing proper Di&s;tinctions, where the &s;ubject calls for them. Hence al&s;o Hearers &s;hould be caution'd, that they don't Reject any Truth in Religion, becau&s;e not &s;o properly expre&s;s'd, in &s;ome Sermons, as could be de&s;ired. And that they &s;hould make allowance for the Ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">firmities of Preachers, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be&s;t, <HI>know but in part, and Prophe&s;y but in part,</HI> 1 Cor. 13.9.</P>
<P>Secondly, WE proceed to con&s;ider, the Remedy pre&s;crib|ed by <HI>Philip,</HI> for the Cure of <HI>Nathanael</HI>'s Prejudice, in the Clo&s;e of the Text. <HI>Come and See.</HI> q d. Don't ra&s;hly con|clude, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is not the <HI>Chri&s;t!</HI> Though I can't readi|ly An&s;wer your Objection, yet I am &s;atisfied He is the Me&s;|&s;iah. And I don't ask you to pin your Faith on my Sleeve, but would have you come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Chri&s;t your &s;elf; and hear His Doctrine, See His Miracles; Ob&s;erve His Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion, and Compare all with the Unerring Oracles of GOD; and then judge if This is not the Me&s;&s;iah. Don't determine, before you've impartially Con&s;idered the matter. This is what Chri&s;tians ought to do, in matters of Religion, and &s;hould not take up Prejudices from Reports and common Vogue. Or, if they have ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> up Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">udices again&s;t what their Spiritual Guides inform them is the Truth, or their Duty; they &s;hould take this Method to Remove them. They &s;hould <HI>Come and See.</HI> Examine things impartially, Be willing to be convinc'd of and ready to embrace the Truth; and attend their Duty, &s;o far as Chri&s;t &s;hall di&s;co|ver it to them. <HI>Coming to Chri&s;t, attending His Directi|ons, is the Be&s;t Method to See our Way through the Wil|derne&s;s of this World, to that which is to Come.</HI></P>
<P>IN further &s;peaking to our Text, I &s;hall take Occa&s;ion (by Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tence) to Di&s;cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the Nature, Cau&s;es &amp; Effects of Prejudice: And al&s;o, of the Method of preventing or Removing Prejudices in matters of Religion. I might al&s;o have con&s;idered the Signs of the&s;e Prejudices and the Obli|gations Chri&s;tians are under to take heed of imbibing them; or to endeavour to lay them a&s;ide: But this would draw out my Di&s;cour&s;e to an undue length: I'll therefore content my &s;elf to &s;peak particul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, only to the Four Heads fir&s;t mentioned. And,</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002388_0011_0FDB3548455514F0">
Fir&s;t, LET us con&s;ider the Nature of Prejudice. Or, What we'er to under&s;tand here, by Prejudice. Now (tho' the word is frequently u&s;ed in a different &s;en&s;e, yet) by Prejudice, (agreeably to the Notation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Word) we intend here, <HI>A Ra&s;h Judgment before Trial:</HI> or, a Wrong Judgment form'd in our Minds, before we'r well appriz'd of the Thing or Per&s;on we'r to judge of Now our Mind is prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd, the Judgment is fore&s;tall'd (as we &s;ay) or, we prejudge the Thing.</P>
<P>THE Object of Prejudice in general (as we here u&s;e the Word) is any Thing or Per&s;on. There are no Per&s;ons, but we may po&s;&s;ibly be prejudic'd with re&s;pect to them, either again&s;t them, or in their favour. There is no Error in Religion &s;o ab&s;urd, but &s;ome or other may embrace it. There is no Truth &s;o evident, no Practice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o commendable, but &s;ome or other may &s;tumble at it.</P>
<P>THE Prejudices that ari&s;e in our Minds, may not only be di&s;tingui&s;h'd in regard of the Object of them (&s;ome re&s;pecting Per&s;ons, others, Things: Some relating to Points in Philo&s;ophy or Politicks; others, to Matters in Religion, which we'r now to con&s;ider.) But in re&s;pect of the de|gree of them. Some are more inveterate and deeply rooted, others are more &s;light and ea&s;ily removed. But then,</P>
<P>Secondly, LET us take a view of &s;ome of the Cau&s;es of Prejudice in Matters of Religion, and &s;ee whence it is that even Good Men, are &s;ometimes under the In&s;tuence of Prejudice. And here I might &s;ay, that it is owing Ori|ginally to the Corruption of our Natures. From the Beginning it was not &s;o. GOD made Man Upright, per|fectly free from all wrong Sentiments. But Man by his Apo&s;tacy, has lo&s;t the Primitive Rect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ade of his Nature; and all his Powers are depraved and di&s;ordered. His Under|&s;tanding is darkned; His Will and Affections are become Rebellious and Ungovernable: the Po&s;&s;ions firangely bya&s;s the Will; and both have a very powerful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uence on the Under&s;tanding to pu&s;h it on to make a judgment of Things
<PB N="6" REF="002388_0012_0FDB3549C7F36A68">and Per&s;ons, before it's rightly inform'd; and hence it comes to be fill'd with Prejudice.</P>
<P>NOW this Corruption remains in part even in good Men; and does in this way frequently di&s;cover it &s;elf in them.</P>
<P>AGAIN, It might be added, that Satan has a great hand in the Prejudices that are to be found in Chri&s;tians again&s;t the things of GOD, as well as in tho&s;e again&s;t One Another. That Grand Adver&s;ary has near Acce&s;s to our Minds, and a Power of Sugge&s;ting Thoughts to them. He can if permit|ted, fill Mens Hearts. <HI>Act.</HI> 5.3. He can mi&s;repre&s;ent Per&s;ons and things to our Minds. He carries on his Ac|cur&s;ed De&s;igns again&s;t us, very much in this way. He can blind the Mind. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.4. He can enter into Men. <HI>Luke</HI> 22.3. And &s;ome he leads Captive <HI>at his Will.</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">6. And this he does by fir&s;t filling the Mind with Pre|judice.</P>
<P>Briefly, IT might be Ob&s;erv'd, that it proceeds from the Ju&s;t Judgment of GOD upon &s;ome Per&s;ons and Societies; that the Minds of Men are fill'd with Prejudice in Matters of Religion. GOD in His &s;potle&s;s Sovereignty does &s;ometimes thus puni&s;h Sin with Sin. We read of tho&s;e, who <HI>be|cau&s;e they received not the Love of the Truth &mdash; for this cau&s;e GOD &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ion, that they &s;hould believe a Lye,</HI> 2 The&s;. 2.10, 11. It al&s;o proves a <HI>Comprehen&s;ive Judgment</HI> on &s;ome Families, Towns and Churches, yea Countries; that &s;ome Good Men are preju|dic'd with re&s;pect to &s;ome <HI>Things</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to be more particular, (not that I pretend to Enu|merate all the &s;pecial Cau&s;es of Prejudice, for they being various, according to the various Objects they refer to, this would be an endle&s;s Task) I will mention a few In&s;tances, which will help to illu&s;trate the Point.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. PREJUDICES in Religion &s;ometimes ari&s;e, from a Mi&s;under&s;tanding, or Mi&s;application of the Sacred Scriptures. The Apo&s;tle Peter ob&s;erves that in the Epi&s;tles of the Great Doctor of the Gentiles, there were <HI>&s;ome things hard to be under&s;tood</HI>&mdash;which &s;ays he, the <HI>Un|learned Wrest</HI>&mdash; 2 Pet. 3.16. The Original Word ren|dred
<PB N="7" REF="002388_0013_0FDB354B45671268"><HI>Wre&s;t,</HI> is a Meraphor, (&s;ay the Criticks) from Tor|mentors, who put a Man on the <HI>Wrack</HI> and Torture him &s;o long, till they make him &s;peak what he never meant to &s;peak. Thus &s;ome Per&s;ons &s;erve the Scriptures, they force a &s;en&s;e upon it, which the Holy Spirit never intended, nor came it into, his mind. There are many that hear the Word that do not under&s;tand it. <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.19. Prea|chers may ju&s;tly expo&s;tulate with &s;ome of their Hearers, as our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour did with &s;ome of his, Joh. 8.43. <HI>Why do you not understand my Speech?</HI> Yea this is &s;ometimes the Ca&s;e of Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples. Joh. 12.16. <HI>The&s;e things understood not his Di&s;ciples at the fir&s;t.</HI> Others, they Under&s;tand indeed, but they mi&s;apply the Word. Sometimes, they apply to others what they &s;hould apply to them&s;elves, and mi&s;erably blunder in the Appli|cation they make to them&s;elves. And hence they're pre|judic'd again&s;t many Truths and Duties in Religion, and again&s;t tho&s;e that don't think with them.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Oftentimes the&s;e Prejudices are the product of Education. We &s;uck in Prejudice, even from the Brea&s;t. The Prejudices of Education are &s;ometimes very <HI>numerous</HI> and commonly very <HI>powerful.</HI> The mind being in our tender Years, more &s;u&s;ceptive of Impre&s;&s;ions of this kind. And &s;uch Prejudices are not eradicated but with great difficulty. They're often propogated from the Father to the Son, and from one Generation they're tran&s;mitted to another. This we &s;ee awfully verifyed in the Prejudices the Jewi&s;h Nation are under again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, and by many &s;orrowful In&s;tances among&s;t Chri&s;tians of various Opinions in Circum&s;tantial Points in Religion. Too many Chri&s;tians taking up their Principles in Religion very much upon Tru&s;t from tho&s;e that have the Care of their Education, they're unaccountably prejudic'd in their favour and again&s;t the contrary. <HI>Mens Po&s;terity often approve their &s;ayings and Practices, tho' they are not good,</HI> P&s;al. 49.13.</P>
<P>AGAIN, The&s;e Prejudices Sometimes ari&s;e from the Great Veneration Men have for Ancient Cu&s;toms, or what they fal&s;ely call, <HI>Ancient.</HI> There are indeed Cu&s;toms that
<PB N="8" REF="002388_0014_0FDB354BAC128438">are Lawful and Commendable, To &s;uch the Apo&s;tle refers, 1 Cor. 11.16. And the more Ancient &s;uch are doubtle&s;s the more Venerable. But there are al&s;o vain Cu&s;toms, <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.3. Yea, there are Abom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble Cu&s;toms, that &s;ometimes obtain too far among a Profe&s;&s;ing People. <HI>Lev.</HI> 18.30.

<P>NOW many Per&s;ons are much &s;way'd by Cu&s;tom. Cu&s;|tom is a Law with them. And in many Ca&s;es it &s;hould be &s;o. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or want of Di&s;tingui&s;hing and duely comparing Cu&s;toms with the Rule, many are betray'd into woful Prejudices again&s;t many of their Fellow Chri&s;tians that can't &s;ubmit to the Cu&s;toms they've a Fondne&s;s for. Now &s;uch as are govern'd by Cu&s;tom, and are not able, or don't give them&s;eves leave to Examine the Grounds of Cu&s;tom, and whither it be Con&s;onant to Rea&s;on and Scripture, will nece&s;&s;arily be prejudic'd in &s;ome mea&s;ure again&s;t the Truth, whenever the Cu&s;toms they follow, hap|pen to be unlawful or inexpedient.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Sometimes Mens Prejudices in Matters of Religion owe their Original to their great Affection to, and high e&s;teem of the&s;e and tho&s;e Per&s;ons, and their mean tho'ts of others. There are too many who in this re&s;pect have the Faith of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t with re&s;|pect of Per&s;ons. They receive the Word as the Word of Man, and not as the Word o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God: Contrary to the roble practice of the The&s;&s;alonians, 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2.13.

<P>AGAIN, Sometimes Mens Unweary Arguing from E|vents, produces Prejudices in their Minds. By this means per&s;ons are &s;ometimes prejudic'd again&s;t the Servants of CHRIST. Thus when the Inhabitants of <HI>Melita</HI> of old, &s;aw the Viper fatten on the Apo&s;tles Hand, they immedi|ately thence inter, that he was a <HI>Murderer;</HI> and therefore tho' <HI>he had e&s;caped the Sea, Vengeance &s;uffered him not to live,</HI> Acts 28.4. But the Wi&s;e Man has told us that all things here come alike to all. And a greater than he has taught us, that the greate&s;t Sufferers, are not always the greate&s;t Sinners. <HI>Luk.</HI> 13. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nit.</HI> Men are &s;ometimes ready to condemn the&s;e and tho&s;e Principles and Practices, meer|ly becau&s;e they occa&s;ion <HI>Divi&s;ion.</HI> But this argues they're prejudic'd in the Ca&s;e. And this way of Arguing from the Event occa&s;ions this their Prejudice. But don't &s;uch forget, Joh. 7.7. <HI>So there was a divi&s;ion among the people becau&s;e of him.</HI> And agreeably &s;ays our Saviour to His Di&s;ciples, Mat. 10.34&mdash; <HI>I came not to &s;end peace, but a Sword</HI>&mdash;We. Eventually. Indeed, in many Ca&s;es we may and ought to argue from Events, but we can't do &s;o in all. I &s;aid therefore Prejudice proceeds from an <HI>unwary arguing</HI> from Events. It is not always &s;ufficient to prove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Action faulty, becau&s;e the Event of it was Trouble &s;ome, or the occa&s;ion of a World of Sin; for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is a Scope of Stumbling and a Rock of Offence.

<P><PB N="10" REF="002388_0016_0FDB355153DC4638">
AGAIN, Some Peoples Prejudices are occa&s;ioned by their <HI>Lusts and Idols.</HI> Thus the Di&s;ciples of Old were prejudic'd again&s;t <HI>Mary's</HI> Anointing our Saviour at the Hou&s;e of <HI>Simon</HI> the Leper. <HI>Matthew</HI> &s;ays, <HI>they'd indignation,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>to what purpo&s;e is this wa&s;te <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Chap. 26.8. <HI>Mark</HI> tells us, <HI>They murmur'd again&s;t her,</HI> Chap. 14.5. <HI>John</HI> informs us, <HI>that Judas I&s;cariot that betray'd him,</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Why was not this Ointment &s;old for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</HI> Chap. 12.5. And adds, ver. 6. <HI>Not that he cared for the poor, but this he &s;aid, becau&s;e he was a thief and had the bag, and bare what was therein.</HI> It was their Coveteou&s;ne&s;s that produc'd their Prejudice again&s;t that Noble Action, and the Godly Woman by whom it was done. Thus Mens inordinate Love of Money prejudices them again&s;t the Doctrine of giving Alms, and Works of Piety, <HI>or devoting their Tenths to Pious U&s;es.</HI> And their Love to many other Lu&s;ts, prejudices them again&s;t the Mi|ni&s;try of the Word: And the Admini&s;tration of Di&s;cipline and Cen&s;ure of the Church.</P>
<P>FINALLY, (to mention no more Particulars) Mens Prejudices are often owing to the Unskilfulne&s;s or Un|faithfulne&s;s and Cowardice, or Unexemplarine&s;s of the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel. Some Pretenders to the Sacred Function are Unskilful and cannot: Others are Cowardly and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">are not; others are Idle and Lukewarm and do not; Others are Unfaithful and will not rightly divide the Word of Truth. They Preach them&s;elves, &s;tudy their own Ea&s;e and Secular Intere&s;t; Prophecy &s;mooth things; and daub with Untempered Mortur; Crying Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace! Hence the People are Prejudiced again&s;t the Truth! Thus when the fal&s;e Prophets of Old had flattered <HI>Ahab,</HI> that he &s;hould pro&s;per at <HI>Ramoth-Gilend,</HI> this Prejudiced him again&s;t the Truth delivered to him by <HI>Micaiah,</HI> and confirmed h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s hatred of him, &s;o that he order'd the Prophet to Pri&s;on, with direction that he &s;hould have Pri&s;oners fare.
<PB N="11" REF="002388_0017_0FDB3553A51BFC18">Thus tho&s;e Mini&s;ters that don't &s;peak the Oracles of GOD, plainly, boldly, zealou&s;ly and yet prudently, and live agreeably, will Prejudice their Hearers, it's to be feared, again&s;t the Truth faithfully di&s;pen&s;ed by others.</P>
<P>AND now having con&s;idered &s;ome of the Cau&s;es of Mens Prejudices in Matters of Religion, I might have &s;hown the Cau&s;es of Chri&s;tians Prejudices again&s;t one another: And &s;aid that &s;ometimes Chri&s;tians (&s;uch as they are) are Prejudiced again&s;t others; becau&s;e others are Prejudiced again&s;t them: Or, becau&s;e they too ea&s;ily take up Reports of their Fellow Chri&s;tians, without enquiring into the Foundation thereof: or, becau&s;e they hear of others Failings, but not of their Humiliations: The News of which is not wont to fly &s;o &s;wiftly as that of their Mi&s;carriages: But it's be&s;ide my pre&s;ent de&s;ign to in&s;i&s;t on the&s;e things. Let us therefore,</P>
<P>Thirdly, CONSIDER, Some of the Woful Effects of Prejudice in Matters of Religion. The&s;e are very nume|rous; A few In&s;tances may be propo&s;ed under two Heads. 1. They hinder much Good. 2. They do much Harm.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, THEY hinder much Good. They hinder Mens doing good. They often hinder Mens accepting Chri&s;t and Entring on a Cour&s;e of Religion. Some are prejudic'd a|gain&s;t engaging in a Cour&s;e of Religion, becau&s;e they ima|gine that the power of Godline&s;s is incon&s;i&s;tent with Plea|&s;ure; others, becau&s;e they apprehend it will hurt their Worldly intere&s;t: Like the Young Man in the Go&s;pel, who went away from Chri&s;t Sorrowful, becau&s;e he had <HI>Great Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions;</HI> and could not find in his heart to &s;ell all, to buy the Pearl of great price; or, becau&s;e they ob&s;erve that &s;ome Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion, don't live an&s;werably to their Profe&s;&s;ion. By &s;uch groundle&s;s Prejudices, &s;ome are diver|ted from giving up them&s;elves to GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002388_0018_0FDB355504F67E18">
AGAIN, The&s;e Prejudices, as they ob&s;truct a work of <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> &s;o they hinder a work of <HI>Reformation.</HI> So long and &s;o far as Men are prejudic'd, either in favour of their own Corrupt Tenents, or Irreligious Practices; or a|gain&s;t the Truths and Ways of God; they'll hold fa&s;t deceit and refu&s;e to return. If they've left off to be wi&s;e and are gone back from God, and are turned a&s;ide after lying vanities; they'll not return, or but feignedly, while their woful Prejudice are retained. Briefly, let what will be ami&s;s, and let it be ever &s;o obvious, while the Man is under the Malignant Influence of Prejudice, he'll hold on his Way, and wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Prejudice in matters of Religion hinders Mens Receiving Good. It lamentably ob&s;tructs the &s;ucce&s;s of the Go&s;pel, the Efficacy of the Word, Sacraments and Cen&s;ures. The Word tho' ever &s;o Excellently Preach'd won't profit, unle&s;s mined with Faith, received in Love, laid up in the Heart, and practi&s;ed in the Life. Now Men won't do this, while prejudic'd again&s;t the Word. So then, the&s;e Prejudices, hinder Mens doing and receiving Good: They hinder the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing from accompanying their Endeavours and the Means of Grace, and con&s;equent|ly the Glory of GOD and the Good of Souls, which is the Chief Good.</P>
<P>Secondly, THEY do much harm, they do a World of Mi&s;chief. Fir&s;t, they often hurt Mens Credit, fully their Reputation, darken their Character, and render them ig|nominious to a great degree.</P>
<P>HENCE, it is that Men often &s;peak and act very Unrea|&s;onably; they're &s;o far from carrying it Chri&s;tianly, that they don't &s;hew them&s;elves Men. They'r like tho&s;e the Apo&s;tle Peter de&s;cribes, <HI>they &s;peak evil of the things they under&s;tand not:</HI> Or, like tho&s;e we read of, 1 Tim. 1.7. <HI>They under&s;tand neither what they &s;ay, nor whereof they affirm.</HI> Now it is very di&s;honourable for any thus to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> them&s;elves, and act like the Hor&s;e and Mule that

<P>AGAIN, The&s;e Prejudices <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Meas. Po&s;&s;erity. As was &s;aid before, they're often propagated from one Go|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation to another. And no wonder, for Chri&s;tians are too often, more zealous in &s;ome <HI>Little Points</HI> that are the Objects of their Prejudice, than in the weightie&s;t Matters in Religion. Now GOD is won't to vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children&mdash; And &s;ince it's not unu&s;ual for the &s;ame mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cau&s;es to produce the &s;ame Effects, they may ju&s;tly expect, that, if Preju|dice in the Parent, hinder'd the Divine Ble&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and pro|our'd the Divine Malodiction; it will produce the &s;ame effect on the Child, that is under the In&s;tance of it. Thus Men Entail a Cur&s;e on their Po&s;terity by their Prejudices in Religion.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, The&s;e Prejudices, hurt Mens Souls. Were it only Mens Names, E&s;tates and Families that were
<PB N="14" REF="002388_0020_0FDB35597A69FEA8">hurt, it were &s;ad, but <HI>this</HI> is not all. They hurt their Souls, and that innumerable ways. They are &s;inful in them&s;elves, and expo&s;e Men to numberle&s;s Temptations to Sin. They lay Men open to the Wiles of Satan, and give him (who loves to fi&s;h in troubled Waters) a great advantage to betray them into many Sins: They greatly quench and grieve and vex the Holy Spirit, and cau&s;e Him to &s;u&s;pend his A&s;&s;i&s;ting and Comforting Influences. They hinder Mens Growth in Grace, and render them &s;ome|times, meer Dwar&s;s in Chri&s;tianity all their Days.</P>
<P>AGAIN, They are Hurtful to Societies. They often occa&s;ion abundance of Sinful Contention and vain Jangling. They &s;et on Fire the whole Cour&s;e of Nature, and &s;ome|times throw all into the la&s;t Confu&s;ion. And becau&s;e of the&s;e things God is often angry, with whole Churches, and Nations and Kingdoms. None that are acquainted with Church Hi&s;tory will doubt the Truth of this&mdash;</P>
<P>IN <HI>&s;hort,</HI> The Prejudices of Chri&s;tians in Matters of Re|ligion, tend to bring an Odium upon Religion it &s;elf and the Profe&s;&s;ors it; yea they reflect di&s;honour upon the Glo|rious Author of it, which is the greate&s;t Mi&s;chief that can be thought of. As nothing does &s;o much Commend Reli|gion to the Love, E&s;teem and Practice of Men, as Unity and Charity among the Profe&s;&s;ors of it, joyn'd with their otherwi&s;e Blamele&s;s and U&s;eful Lives: So, Nothing does more effectually Scandalize the World again&s;t Religion, and <HI>cau&s;e them to &s;et their Mouths again&s;t the very Heavens, than Sinful Contentions and Animo&s;ities and want of Chri&s;tian Charity among the Profe&s;&s;ors of it.</HI> Now if Prejudice be at the Bottom of all this, then that is ultimate|ly the <HI>Blameable Cau&s;e</HI> that Religion is brought into Di&s;|repute, and that Men &s;ay to the Almighty depart from us. But thus I've mention'd &s;ome of the Doleful Effects of Preju|dice in Religious Matters, and proceed in the La&s;t place to propo&s;e a Method of Preventing or Removing &s;uch Preju|dices.

<P><PB N="15" REF="002388_0021_0FDB355B120D3740">
Fir&s;t, WHAT &s;hould Chri&s;tians do, to prevent the&s;e Prejudices? That they may'nt be infected with this Con|tagious Malady?</P>

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THEY &s;hould take heed of being prejudic'd at the Di&s;pen&s;ers of the Word, or Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion.

They'll &s;ometimes groundle&s;ly Su&s;pect the Preacher has &s;ome particular Reference to their Ca&s;e (and pray Sirs what if he has?) and this is an Unpardonable Crime with them! Hence they Nau&s;eate and Di&s;reli&s;h the Be&s;t Sermons, and &s;everal ways they di&s;cover this; forget|ting, Mini&s;ters are to give to every one their Portion in its Sea&s;on, whither they will hear or whither they will for|bear, and that upon pain of Eternal Damnation if they re|pent not. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.8. Such are therefore Unrea&s;onable Men, with a witne&s;s (from all of whom, <HI>Libera nos Do|mine!</HI>) that are angry with the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST for telling them the Truth, &s;eeing herein they do, but what it is their Duty to do; Nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon them and wo be unto them if they do it not. They &s;hould then beware of being prejudic'd again&s;t the Mini&s;ters of Religion, that would Steer clear of Prejudices in Religion. For mo&s;t certain it is, that when Men have learnt on any &s;core to de&s;pi&s;e the Me&s;&s;engers of the LORD; they'll &s;oon de&s;pi&s;e the Me&s;&s;age, and loath the be&s;t Sermons they can preach, as the I&s;raelites did the Manna in the Wilderne&s;s. Hence tho&s;e very Sermons which whil&s;t they were free from Pre|judice, again&s;t the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, they would have highly applauded, and thought they could &s;carce ex|ceed in Commending, now they'll Hi&s;s as &s;carce worth the Hearing. I &s;peak what I know, and te&s;tify what I have &s;een in &s;everal In&s;tances! <HI>Horre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ferens.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="002388_0022_0FDB355F2B1AF538">
AGAIN, They mu&s;t al&s;o take hoed of being prejudic'd again&s;t the Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion, and looking upon them in general as a Company of Hypocrites. For though its probable there's none of our Churches, wherein there are not &s;ome Hypocrites, yet the Law of Charity obliges us to hope, that many it may be the mo&s;t are Sincere. And &s;uch are very unju&s;t that condemn all, for the &s;ake of &s;ome few. And they act very un&s;afely in this re&s;pect, in that this their way tends to prejudice them again&s;t Religion.</P>
<P>Secondly, THEY &s;hould be well acquainted with the Word of GOD, and Read and Hear it and &s;ubmit to it as the Word of GOD.</P>
<P>THE Sacred Scriptures <HI>are able to make wi&s;e unto Sal|vation,</HI> to <HI>enlighten the Eyes;</HI> and <HI>make wi&s;e the Simple.</HI> They are perfect, Teaching all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be Be|lieved and Done in Religion. And &s;o long and &s;o far as our Judgments and Practices are govern'd by the Word of GOD, we're &s;afe; there's no Danger of our being preju|dic'd again&s;t the Truths and Ways of GOD. But when we depart from this Rule, we are immediately in Danger. So then Chri&s;tians &s;hould &s;earch the Scriptures daily and diligently, and labour to Under&s;tand what they Read and Hear, and Submit to what they find to be the Truth, how contrary &s;oever to their Opinion or Practice, Humour or Intere&s;t: Or to the Opinion or Practice of any other Per&s;on or Party. Chri&s;tians mu&s;t therefore Read and Hear the Word, as the Word of GOD, and not as the Word of Man. For when once Chri&s;tians come to hear Sermons as the Word of Man and look no further, not con&s;idering in who&s;e &s;tead the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel &s;tand while in the Di&s;charge of their Office; and in who&s;e Name they &s;peak; they'll &s;oon be in danger of &s;aying at lea&s;t in their Practice, as the Hearers of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah, Chap.</HI> 6.16, 17. &mdash; <HI>We will not Walk therein &mdash; We will not Hearken:</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002388_0023_0FDB1268C63C3100">
Thirdly, THEY &s;hould take heed of Super&s;tition. Some Per&s;ons are much addicted to Super&s;tition. Thus it is with mo&s;t that are of a Scrupulous Con&s;cience. They'r ready to look upon many things as Sins, which God has not forbidden: And many things as Duty which GOD has not required. They'd be wi&s;er and holier, not only than their Teachers, but then God Him&s;elf. Whereas it is by the Law, we attain the knowledge of Sin, <HI>And where there is no Law there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI> Now as Prejudice &s;ometimes begets Super&s;tition, &s;o Super&s;tition leads to Prejudice, and not &s;eldom ends in it, as in an enchanted Circle. Chri&s;tians then mu&s;t carefully avoid Super&s;tition, or beware of thinking them&s;elves or others, oblig'd to do more than the Law requires, or to ab&s;tain from what the Law no where forbids.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>COME and See.</HI> i. e. Get and maintain within you a Teachable, Governable Di&s;po&s;ition. <HI>Come and See.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Exerci&s;e your Rea&s;on. Don't &s;hut your Eyes again&s;t the Light. Hear Coun&s;el and receive In&s;truction that ye may be wi&s;e in your Latter End. Shew your &s;elves Men, and act like Cau&s;es by Coun&s;el. Remember how you have received and heard. Con&s;ider and take Advice. Particularly, <HI>Come and See</HI> the Evil Cau&s;es of Prejudice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> See how it is owing Originally to the Cor|ruption of our Nature; and that Satan has a deep De&s;ign in promoting Prejudice in the minds of Chri&s;tians; and that &s;ometimes again&s;t &s;ome of the lea&s;t Commands, knowing what our Saviour has &s;aid, <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.19. <HI>Who&s;oever therefore &s;hall break one of the&s;e lea&s;t commandments, and &s;hall teach men &s;o, he &s;hall be called the lea&s;t in the kingdom of heaven: but who&s;oever &s;hall do and teach them, the &s;ame &s;hall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Come and &s;ee</HI> that the Righteous God, does &s;ometimes &s;uffer this own Servants to labour of the&s;e Prejudices, for a Time and in a Degree. <HI>Peter</HI> him&s;elf, was prejudic'd again&s;t the Doctrine of our Saviours Sufferings. And how &s;everely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our Saviour rebuke him, Mat. 16, 23. <HI>Get thee be|hind me Satan</HI>&mdash;.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Come and &s;ee the Doleful Effects of Preju|dice,
<PB N="18" REF="002388_0024_0FDB3563452AB548">how it makes way for Sattn's entring into Men, and gives him a great Advantage again&s;t them: How it keeps Chri&s;t out of the Soul, and keeps Multitude of Souls out of Heaven. And oftentimes, it is a &s;mall matter at fir&s;t that occa&s;ions the Prejudice, or that Per&s;ons are Prejudic'd about, that proves fatal and ruinous. A &s;mall matter &s;ometimes prejudices Chri&s;tians again&s;t one another, whereby they're betray'd into many Sins, and diverted from many Duties, and they are left to go on in the paths of the De&s;troyer, heaping up Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath&mdash;.</P>
<P>Finally, BE much in Prayer to GOD to keep your Hearts and Minds thro' Chri&s;t Je&s;us. All our Endeavours to keep our &s;elves will be in vain unle&s;s GOD undertake for us. He is I&s;raels Keeper, He keepeth the feet of His Saints! Let us then commit the keeping of our Souls to Him, who is able to keep what we commit to Him; and to pre&s;ent us faultle&s;s before the pre&s;ence of His Glory with exceeding Joy!</P>
<P>But then the</P>
<P><HI>Second Enquiry</HI> is, WHAT &s;hould Chri&s;tians do when under Prejudice, to get their Prejudices Removed? What &s;hall they do, that their Minds may be cured of this evil Di&s;ea&s;e, which weakens and defiles their Minds; Unfits them for and hinders them in then Operations, Tarni&s;hes their B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and will prove deadly to the Soul, unle&s;s it be realed</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>COME and See.</HI> If you've any rea&s;on to &s;u&s;|pect, if any Wi&s;e, Knowing, Experienc'd Chri&s;tians &s;ug|ge&s;t to you their Fears you are infected with this Di&s;ea&s;e, <HI>Come</HI> to the Word and to the Hou&s;e of GOD, and try your &s;elves by the Signs of Prejudice propos'd there. It's a rul'd Ca&s;e, determin'd by the <HI>Infallible Judge of Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;ies,</HI> even Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>That be that doth evil bateth the Light,</HI>&mdash;Job. 3.20. It's al&s;o an Argument of Prejudic, when Per&s;ons reject Principles and Practices in Religion, becau&s;e embrac'd and profe&s;s'd and attended to, by &s;uch as they've no Charity for. <HI>Alas the Truth
<PB N="19" REF="002388_0025_0FDB3568521DD528">is as precious in the Church of Rome, as in the Churches of New England.</HI> This Truth can lo&s;e nothing of its Excellency becau&s;e believ'd and profe&s;s'd by an Heretick. Its never the le&s;s a precious Truth, <HI>That its &s;afe&s;t to Tru&s;t to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST alone for Ju&s;tifica|tion,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Bellarmine</HI> the Atlas of Popery confe&s;s'd it at his Death. Its never the le&s;s a precious Truth and a Fundamental Article of our Holy Religion, That <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God,</HI> becau&s;e the Devils in our Sa|viours Time confe&s;s'd it (without doubt) with a cur&s;ed De&s;ign to prejudice the World again&s;t it. Now this I &s;ay, Try your &s;elves by &s;uch Signs; and be willing to know you are infected with this Di&s;temper, if you are &s;o. What Good will it do you to per&s;wade your &s;elves, you are well, when you are Sick. Some People in a Phrenzy, or Delirious, when the Mortal Fever is even at the height think them&s;elves well, and they would de&s;troy them&s;elves if not prevented. But before the Di&s;temper prevail thus far, &s;ee your Malady, and &s;ee your Danger; See the Nece&s;&s;ity and Advantage of your being healed, and al&s;o the Nece&s;&s;ity of your being in the U&s;e of Means. You will never be cured if you do not do &s;o. <HI>The whole have no need of the Phy&s;ician, but they that are Sick.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, SEEK out &s;ea&s;onably and in good earne&s;t for Help. The longer you delay, the more the Di&s;ea&s;e will prevail, and the more difficult will be the Cure. If other Methods avail not, repair to your Spiritual Phy&s;ician, your Pa&s;tor, and be content to follow his Direction, and, don't be angry with him, for telling you that you'r infected (as the manner of &s;ome is) and giving you an Account of the Ri&s;e, Seat and Tendency of your Di&s;temper, and how 'twill operate, and what you mu&s;t do to be cured; and for doing his utmo&s;t to heal you.</P>
<P>Thirdly, FOLLOW the In&s;tructions of your Spiritual Phy&s;ician, &s;o far as they are con&s;i&s;tent with Scripture and Rea&s;on, and don't meddle with &s;uch as don't under&s;tand your Malady, or with &s;uch things as may be a di&s;&s;ervice
<PB N="20" REF="002388_0026_0FDB356B883FB1C0">to you. This is tho't Rea&s;onable among&s;t Men, in other Ca&s;es, we all readily &s;ubmit to this Method, when we or ours are Sick &mdash;. We don't baulk the Directions of the Phy&s;ician becau&s;e the pur&s;uing of them, will put us in Pain, or make us Sick, or it may be occa&s;ion us &s;ome &s;hame, and a little &s;hock our Mode&s;ty. Well, Let us be as wi&s;e for our Souls.</P>
<P>Finally, LOOK <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> GOD to direct to, and ble&s;s Means for your Cure. Without Him, we are all Phy&s;icians of no value! He is the Great Phy&s;ician of Souls, The Lord our Healer. And tho' He will have us u&s;e the Means, we mu&s;t not re&s;t in them, but wait on Him for a Ble&s;&s;ing. And in as much as in this Ca&s;e, our Di&s;ea&s;e is al&s;o our Sin, we mu&s;t bewail it before God, and beg of Him Repentance and Forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now &s;hut up the Di&s;cour&s;e, with &s;aying Two Things upon the whole,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, LET us Pity and Pray for and as we can be Help|ful to &s;uch as Labour under &s;uch Prejudice as we have heard &s;omething of. We are all of us Objects of Pity, when and &s;o far, as we are under the power of &s;uch Prejudice. We are then e&s;pecially objects of the Divine Compa&s;&s;ion in that re&s;pect, and wo unto us if God &s;hould mark &s;uch our Iniquities again&s;t us! We are al&s;o, under &s;uch Circum&s;tances &s;o far objects of the Pity of our Fel|low-Chri&s;tians. Let us then have Compa&s;&s;ion one towards another, and manife&s;t it, by Praying heartily one for ano|ther: Bearing one anothers Burdens, and making all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;onable Allowance one for another; and Endeavouring with the Meekne&s;s of Wi&s;dom to heal one another. Indeed Chri&s;tians that &s;eem wilfully prejudiced, are to be admoni&s;h|ed and reproved, but then we mu&s;t do it &s;ea&s;onably and &s;uitably: &s;till remembring and governing our &s;elves by the&s;e Rules, Let all things be done to the Glory of God: To Edification and in Charity, as well as Decently and in Order.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="002388_0027_0FDB356D01157F10">
Secondly, LET us all take heed of Prejudice in Matters, wherein Religion is concerned. This is our Luty, Wi&s;dom and Intere&s;t. The Light of Nature, The Word of GOD. The woful Experience of the People of GOD oblige to this. The&s;e Prejudices render us &s;o far unlike to God. While we indulge them we are making work for Repen|tance, and lay our &s;elves open to the Devices of Satan. Let &s;uch as think they &s;tand, take heed then, lea&s;t they fall. He that is not Prejudiced in this or the other ca&s;e, and that &s;tands and wonders at his Neighbour's weakne&s;s, may be as mi&s;erably Prejudiced in &s;ome other ca&s;e, it God &s;ee meet to let loo&s;e his Corruptions, and &s;uffer the Evil One to a&s;&s;ault Him. Let us then, not be high-minded but fear!</P>
<P>AND now to Him that is able to keep us from falling, or, to recover us if fallen, under the Influence of Prejudice in Religion; To the only Wi&s;e God our Savi|our, be Glory and Maje&s;ty, Dominion and Power, both now and Ever. AMEN.</P>
