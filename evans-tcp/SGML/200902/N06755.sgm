<P>WE can't find one Word in the Bible, for keeping the fir&s;t Day of the Week as a Sabbath; and, therefore we have continued in earne&s;t Prayer to God; begging of him, to direct us in his Ways, and e&s;pecially concerning this pretended Sabbath; and he has taught us by his Spirit, and the Scriptures, to labour on it publickly as on other Days, and not fear what Man can do; according to the Scriptures: And when we have &s;o laboured publickly on &s;aid pretended Sabbath, to plea&s;e God, he hath &s;hewed us plainly by his Spi|rit, that we plea&s;ed him in &s;o doing; and al&s;o, opened our Under&s;tanding, to under&s;tand the Scriptures. And when the Authority have been

&s;uffered to puni&s;h us, God hath been with us, and comforted us by his Holy Spirit; and &s;hewed us plainly, that he that is in us, is greater than he that is in our Per&s;ecutors; as in <HI>John</HI> iv. 4. E&s;pecially in the Whippings, Impri&s;onments, and Spoilings of Goods, which we have endured within two Years. And this we have written, to encourage all them that God has enlightened, to &s;ee that the fir&s;t Day of the Week is not his Sabbath; that they may be encouraged to take up their Cro&s;s, in this and all other Things; that he doth enlighten them by his Spirit, and the Scriptures; and <HI>not fear them which kill the Body, and after that have no more that they can do: But fear him that is able to de&s;troy both Soul and Body in Hell:</HI> According to <HI>Mat.</HI> x, 28, and <HI>Luke</HI> xii, 4. See al&s;o, <HI>Mat.</HI> xvi, 24, &amp;c. <HI>Then &s;aid Je&s;us unto his Di&s;ciples, if any Man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his Cro&s;s, and follow me: For who&s;oever will &s;ave his Life, &s;hall lo&s;e it, and who&s;oever will lo&s;e his Life for my Sake, &s;hall find it: For what is a Man profited if he &s;hall gain the whole World, and lo&s;e his own Soul.</HI> Al&s;o, <HI>Mat.</HI> x, 36, &amp;c. <HI>A Man's Foes &s;hall be tho&s;e of his own Hou&s;hold. He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not worthy of me: He that findeth his Life, &s;hall lo&s;e it; and he that lo&s;eth his Life for my Sake, &s;hall find it.</HI> Al&s;o <HI>Luke</HI> xiv, 26, <HI>If any Man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren and Si&s;ters; yea, and his own Life al&s;o, he cannot be my Di&s;ciple.</HI> Thus by Chri&s;t's Te&s;timony, we may

&s;ee, that if any Man will be held back from follow|ing Chri&s;t by the&s;e worldly Things, tho' it be his own Life, he cannot be Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciple. For tho' <HI>by Grace we are &s;aved, through Faith, and that not of our&s;elves, it is the Gift of God;</HI> yet by the Scriptures above quoted, and many more, if we do not take up our Cro&s;s, we &s;hall not be worthy of this Gift. Al&s;o, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 11, 12. <HI>For if we be dead with him, we &s;hall al&s;o live with him; if we &s;uffer, we &s;hall al&s;o reign with him: If we deny him, he al&s;o will deny us.</HI> And whereas Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>he that taketh not his Cro&s;s, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</HI> By which we may al&s;o under&s;tand, that all them which do take up their Cro&s;s, and follow after him, are worthy of him. And we can boldly te&s;tify, that in our taking up this Cro&s;s, and working publickly on the fir&s;t Day of the Week, to plea&s;e God, he doth own us to be worthy of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t: For he hath witne&s;&s;ed it by his Holy Spirit in our Hearts: By which we al&s;o know, that the Scripture is true; and that the Practice of keeping this pretended Sabbath, in this Colony, is Super&s;tition, Idolatry, and Abomination in the Sight of God. Al&s;o, every Text of Scripture, that the Mini&s;ters have ever brought, to convince us that the fir&s;t Day of the Week is a Sabbath, has another Meaning, and not as they pretend: For by peru&s;ing tho&s;e Scriptures, it appears plainly, that Chri&s;t, and the holy Men that &s;pake them Scriptures, did not mean to teach People to keep the fir&s;t Day of the Week; neither was it in their Mind to teach any &s;uch Thing; So that there is not one Word in
<PB N="4" REF="008575_0004_102F871280F97748">
all the Bible, according to the true Intent and Meaning thereof, for this pretended Sabbath; and the Scripture &s;ays, <HI>Where no Law is, there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> Rom. iv, 15, and <HI>Sin is not imputed when there is no Law,</HI> Rom. v. 13; and the Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Faith of this Colony, &s;ays, in page 7, <HI>Believe in all Divine Wor&s;hip: It is not enough, that this or that Act of Wor&s;hip is not forbidden in the Word of God; if it be not commanded, and you per|form it, you may fear you will be found guilty.</HI> Thus by their own Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, they may fear they will be found guilty for keeping their pretended Sabbath them&s;elves; then how much more guilty will they be found, for per&s;ecuting others, to force them to keep it, by &s;poiling their Goods, and im|pri&s;oning and torturing their Bodies! even them that God hath enlightened to &s;ee that this Sabbath is of Men, and that they ought not to conform to it; becau&s;e God requires them to wor&s;hip him in Spirit and in Truth: The Scripture &s;ays, <HI>It is vain to wor&s;hip God by the Commandments of Men.</HI></P>
<P>WE de&s;ire People to &s;earch the Scriptures, and &s;ee whether the&s;e Things are &s;o, or no: And for Encouragement, the fir&s;t Per&s;on that &s;hews us the Chapter and Ver&s;e in the Bible, that &s;ays one Word about keeping the fir&s;t Day of the Week for a Sabbath, &s;hall have Ten Pounds Lawful Money Reward for his Trouble, paid by us, or either of us,</P>
