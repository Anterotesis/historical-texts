<P>_IN the Ver&s;e foregoing, we have King David's devout A&s;cription of Ble&s;&s;ing and Prai&s;e to the Lord God of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> for the liberal free-will Offerings of the Princes towards building the Temple: In the Text he declares that this God who was the Object of his Prai&s;e, is im|men&s;ely

great, and incomprehen&s;ively glo|rious. <HI>Thine, O Lord, is the Greatne&s;s&mdash;</HI> In the Original, it is <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the &s;elf-exi&s;t|ing, and eternal God, who has his Being and Perfections in and of him&s;elf, indepen|dently; and is the fir&s;t Cau&s;e, and la&s;t End of all Things.</P>
<P>I SHALL con&s;ider the Words as they lie in the Text.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>Greatne&s;s is the Lord's.</HI> And that in a &s;ingular Manner and tran&s;cendent Degree. God is infinite in his Being and all adorable Perfections.<HI>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be prai&s;ed; and his Greatne&s;s is un&s;earchable,</HI> P&s;al. 145.3. The Nations when compar'd with him, are as a Drop of a Bucket, as the &s;mall Du&s;t of the Balance: yea all Nations before him are as Nothing, and they are counted to him le&s;s than No|thing and Vanity.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 40.15,&mdash;17.</NOTE> He is immen&s;e, and Omnipre&s;ent.

<HI>neglect &s;o great Salvation,</HI> Upon the whole, there's abundant Rea&s;on to a&s;cribe <HI>Great|ne&s;s to our God,</HI> Deut. 32.3.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The Power is the Lord's.</HI> P&s;alm. 62, 11. <HI>God hath &s;poken once; twice have I heard this, that Power belongeth unto God,</HI> Con&s;ider Power as it may &s;ignify <HI>Authority:</HI> So it belongs to God, and that in a &s;ingular Manner. God is the <HI>mo&s;t High,</HI> over all, God ble&s;&s;ed forever. He is the <HI>high and lofty One,</HI> that dwelleth in the high and holy Place, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 57.15. As he made all Things, &s;o he has an ab&s;olute Right to govern and di&s;po&s;e of them, ac|cording to his &s;overeign Will. He is exalt|ed above all Principalities and Powers, Thrones and Dominions. And is the <HI>ble&s;|&s;ed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI> 1 Tim. 6.15. God is higher than the highe&s;t, and his Dominion ruleth over all. He is above his and his People's Enemies, even in tho&s;e Things wherein they deal mo&s;t proudly.</P>

is &s;tronger than that &s;trong One, and &s;poils him of his Goods. He gave his Apo&s;tles <HI>Power over Devils, Luke</HI> 9.1. And when he plea&s;eth, he converts Sinners according to the exceeding Greatne&s;s of his Power: Turns them from Darkne&s;s unto Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God. And he makes u&s;e of frail Men as In&s;truments in this great Work, that the Excellency of the Power may appear to be of God. And then God maintains the Work of his Grace in them again&s;t all Oppo&s;ition from Earth and Hell, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.5. <HI>Who are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation.</HI> In a Word, God is Omnipotent, and there is no Strength can prevail again&s;t him.

Ha&s;t thou not heard, that the everla&s;ting God, the Lord, the Creator of the Ends of the Earth fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no &s;earching of his Under&s;tanding.

Let us hear and obey that Word, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.1. <HI>I am the Al|mighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.</HI> And as this glorious God has given all Power to the Son as Mediator, let us depend on him as able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come unto God by him. Let us prai&s;e him, &s;aying, <HI>Thine is the King|dom, and the Power and the Glory, forever, Amen.</HI> Matth. 6.13. Which brings me to the third Head of our Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">III. The Glory is the Lord's. <HI>Glory is the Excellency of a Being whereby it is worthy of Prai&s;e.</HI> <NOTE N="dragger" PLACE="foot">A worthy Author gives this De&s;cription.

<PB N="12" REF="009269_0011_10320D900AA474F0">
of God are infinite and eternal, and therefore He alone is worthy to be prai&s;ed in a, <HI>religious Manner.</HI> We mu&s;t bow down and wor&s;hip him, when we a&s;cribe Glory and Prai&s;e to his great Name. There's God's <HI>e&s;&s;ential Glory,</HI> which is the infinite Fulne&s;s and Perfection of his divine Nature. This is ever the &s;ame, and can receive no Addition, even from the highe&s;t Prai&s;es of Angels, <HI>Neh.</HI> 9.5. <HI>And ble&s;&s;ed be thy glo|rious Name, which is exalted above all Ble&s;&s;ing and Prai&s;e.</HI> God dwells in Light inacce&s;&s;ible and full of Glory.

in the Image of God their Creator. Thus we mu&s;t al&s;o a&s;cribe to God the Glory of his Works of Providence, and of Redemp|tion. When the Angels bro't the good Tid|ings of the Birth of our Saviour, <HI>Chri&s;t the Lord,</HI> they prai&s;ed God &s;aying, <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on Earth Peace, good Will towards Men.</HI> Luk. 2.14. When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> prayed that God would &s;hew him his Glory, he declares that he could not <HI>&s;ee his Face</HI> and live; and that, while his Glory pa&s;&s;ed by, he would cover him with his Hand, and then take away his Hand, that he might &s;ee his <HI>back Parts</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 23.22, 23.</NOTE>.

We mu&s;t then celebrate the tran&s;cendent Excellencies of the Lord of Glory, and &s;o &s;acrifice Prai&s;e, as to glorify God, and pay the Tri|bute of Honour due to his Name; acknow|ledging that there is none like unto him,

none that may be compared with him. <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.13. <HI>And every Creature which is in Heaven, and on the Earth, and under the Earth, and &s;uch as are in the Sea, and all that are in them, heard I, &s;aying, Ble&s;&s;ing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power be unto him that &s;itteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</HI> But we may &s;peak further of this, under the la&s;t Head, which treats of the divine Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE <HI>Victory is the Lord's.</HI> Prov. 21.31. <HI>The Hor&s;e is prepared again&s;t the Day of Battle; but Safety is of the Lord.</HI> Margin, <HI>Victory.</HI> He is the God of Ar|mies, the Lord &s;trong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battle.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 24.8.</NOTE> The Lord of Ho&s;ts holds the Events of War in his Almighty Hand, &s;o that the Race is not to the &s;wift, <HI>nor the Battle to the &s;trong;</HI> but Time and Chance happen to them all.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccl. 9.11.</NOTE> There are certain Incidents which God over-rules to give Succe&s;s to the weaker Side. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 14.6. <HI>There is no Re&s;traint to the Lord, to &s;ave by many or by few.</HI> Was there Time, I might here &s;peak of our <HI>&s;piritual Warfare,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="009269_0014_10320D955205B178">
and &s;hew that God gives his People the Victory over their gho&s;tly Enemies. The Almighty ordain'd Strength out of the Mouth of Babes, when he &s;ent forth his Apo&s;tles and other Mini&s;ters, to &s;et up his Kingdom on the Ruins of Satan's u&s;urped Dominion: The Weapons of their Warfare were migh|ty through God, for pulling down the &s;trong Holds of the Evil One, and for &s;ub|duing a con&s;iderable Part of the then know World, to the Obedience of Faith. The Lord triumph'd over Principalities and Pow|ers, over the Lu&s;ts of Men, and the &s;trong Prejudices of Education; &s;o that the Rulers of the Darkne&s;s of this World fled before the Light of the glorious Go&s;pel, accompanied with the divine Spirit, as the Shades of Night before the ri&s;ing Sun. But to return, and con&s;ider War in a literal Sen&s;e, as manag'd by <HI>Arms of Fle&s;h,</HI> and we &s;hall find that God has in a wonderful Manner broken the Enemies and Oppre&s;&s;ors of his People, and deliver'd them from tho&s;e that were too &s;trong for them. Thus when <HI>Pharaoh</HI> pur&s;ued his ancient People whom he brought forth out of <HI>Egygt</HI> with a mighty Hand, and out-&s;tretched Arm;
<PB N="16" REF="009269_0015_10320D9768749528">
the God of I&s;rael divided the Red-Sea, and gave his People a &s;afe Pa&s;&s;age thro' it, as on dry Ground; and overthrew their Enemies. The Depths cover'd them, they &s;ank to the Bottom as a Stone. Then &s;ang <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the Children of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> the Lord triumphed gloriou&s;ly: the Hor&s;e and his Rider hath he thrown into the Sea. <HI>Exod.</HI> 15.1. Ver. 6. <HI>Thy right Hand, O Lord, is become glorious in Power: thy right Hand, O Lord, hath da&s;hed in Pieces the Enemy.</HI> Ver. 10, 11. <HI>Thou did&s;t blow with thy Wind, the Sea covered them: they &s;ank as Lead in the mighty Waters. Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among&s;t the Gods? Who is like thee, glorious in Holi|ne&s;s, fearful in Prai&s;es, doing Wonders.</HI> In like Manner, God open'd a Way for his People thro' <HI>Jordan,</HI> into the Land of <HI>Ca|naan,</HI> and &s;ubdued Nations greater and mightier than they. The mighty Redeemer appear'd to <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> when entred <HI>Canaan,</HI> in humane Shape, and as Captain of the Lord's Ho&s;t. Under this divine Per&s;on, and encourag'd by his Pre&s;ence, this victorious General marched at the Head of the Ar|mies of I&s;rael. The Walls of <HI>Jericho</HI>

The Lord is my Deliverer, my Strength, and the Horn of my Salvati|on; and gives God the Glory of his military Virtues and Succe&s;s, P&s;alm. 18.34, 35. <HI>He teacheth my Hands to War, &s;o that a Bow of Steel is broken by mine Arms.

And in the 19th Ch. 1, 2. <HI>And after the&s;e Things I heard a great Voice of much People in Heaven, &s;aying, Alleluia; Salvation, and Glory, and Honour, and Power unto the Lord our God: For true and righteous are his Judgments; for he hath judged the great Whore,</HI> i.e. idolatrous <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
