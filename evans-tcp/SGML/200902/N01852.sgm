<HEAD>A PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>Containing &s;ome Animadver&s;ions upon the <HI>Praeface</HI> to the <HI>Choice Dialogues.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> Was the other Day very much &s;ur|prized to meet with a &s;mall Pam|phlet, wearing this &s;pecious and very promi&s;ing Title; <HI>Choice Dialogues, between a Godly Mini&s;ter, and an hone&s;t Countrey-Man, concerning Election and Prede&s;tination,</HI> &amp;c. Both the <HI>Sublimity</HI> of the Subject, no le&s;s than the <HI>Secret and Eternal Decrees</HI> of the Deity, a very ab&s;tru&s;e Theme; as al&s;o the <HI>Choice|ne&s;s</HI> of the promi&s;ed Dialogues, rai&s;ed my Expectations to a very great Pitch. <HI>But</HI> upon the Peru&s;al of them; I &s;oon found the Author laid him&s;elf open to the Cen&s;ures which <HI>Horace</HI> tells us they are liable to fall under, who promi&s;e more than they can per|form, and fill the Reader up with vain Hopes, only to tantalize and baulk him in his Ex|pectations.</P>
<P>Amphora caepit

<LG>
<L>Which &s;uffer me to Engli&s;h after this manner.</L>
<L><HI>Since you began with &s;o much Pomp and Show</HI></L>
<L><HI>How is it, Man, the End's &s;o vile and low?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Prithee, what wilt thou bring worth all this Rout and Tou&s;e?</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Mountain groans in Travail, and brings forth a Mou&s;e.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as is natural to every Reader, who de&s;ires to be informed of the <HI>Occa&s;ion, De&s;ign, and Scope</HI> of any Work, I dipped into the <HI>Preface to the Reader,</HI> hoping there to find &s;ome &s;pecial and weighty Rea&s;ons, which urged the <HI>Editor</HI> to publi&s;h the&s;e Controver&s;ial and Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igious Dialogues. <HI>Editor,</HI> I &s;ay; for it is hard to know whe|ther <HI>he,</HI> or his <HI>Aged Divine</HI> wrote them, or rather by a Juggle they brought forth the Mungril between them. He &s;ays, it was written by <HI>a Reverend and Laborious Pa&s;|tor in Chri&s;t's Flock, by one who has been for almo&s;t twice thirty years, a faithful and painful Labourer in Chri&s;t's Vineyard.</HI> I believe I know the <HI>Reverend and Laborious Pa&s;tor</HI> he means, <HI>viz.</HI> a cer|tain <HI>Jacobite</HI> Clergy-man, who, I dare vouch
<PB N="iii" REF="002194_0005_0FDAC8A9200C6050">has Served the <HI>Pretender ten</HI> years, where he has the Flock of Chri&s;t <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>But to return, I could not for my Life find any weighty Rea&s;on for his Publi&s;hing the&s;e <HI>Choice Dialogues.</HI> I began to think, It might be, that &s;ome of the Young Strip|plings had roared <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> out of the Pulpits; but with all my inqui&s;itive Search|es could not find it &s;o. I then began to recol|lect my &s;elf, and as my <HI>Young Logic</HI> taught me, began to <HI>compare, compound and di|vide Ideas,</HI> but could not with all my Wits &s;ee the <HI>Connection</HI> of the <HI>Ideas</HI> of <HI>[Young Stripling]</HI> and <HI>[Prede&s;tination]</HI> or ima|gine how a Di&s;cour&s;e upon the <HI>awful and &s;ecret Decrees</HI> of God naturally led a Man to rail at a <HI>Young Presbyterian.</HI> And re|ally I never met with &s;uch an Oddity and Incon&s;i&s;tency, as to fill a Book with Calumnies and Reproaches, which is written out of <HI>Charity to the Souls of Men. Full of Charity,</HI> brim full of it! and yet through|out the whole Book tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the Rules of that excellent Grace, which the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 6, 7. Charity &s;uffereth long, and is kind; Charity envieth not; Charity vaunteth not it &s;elf, is not puf|fed up; doth not behave it &s;elf un&s;eem|ly, &s;eeketh not her own, is not ea&s;ily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoyceth not in Iniquity, but rejoyceth in the Truth; beareth all things, believeth all
<PB N="iv" REF="002194_0006_0FDAC8AA92B07450">Things, hopeth all Things, endureth all Things.</HI> But his high-flying bitter Spirit &s;avours of too much Rancor, to let the World think, that Love to Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and not Hatred to the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> was the Spring and Motive of his underta|king this &s;currilous Work.</P>
<P><HI>As for the Dialogues them&s;elves,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>they contain a rich and precious &s;tore of Spiritual Knowledge, and Godly Com|fort.</HI> So the Prefacer thinks. But others are not of his Mind. Why are you angry, Sir? Won't you &s;uffer us <HI>con&s;cientiou&s;ly to di&s;&s;ent from you?</HI></P>
<P>Nay, but &s;top <HI>Young Stripling! they &s;peak to the Hearts of Men in a very ea&s;ie and familiar Manner, &s;o that the meane&s;t Plough-man, the very meane&s;t of God's People may under&s;tand them.</HI> Right, my Friend, no Body di&s;putes but the meane&s;t Plough-man may dive to the profound Bottom of them The <HI>Dialogues</HI> we give in the am|ple&s;t Te&s;timony you can de&s;ire, they are <HI>plain enough;</HI> but is the Subject you write of made as <HI>plain?</HI> No Body de&s;pairs that ever I heard of, of penetrating into your deepe&s;t Re|ce&s;&s;es, by a &s;ingle Glance. That ever the Man &s;hould be afraid, the World will deny reading his Book, for fear it &s;hould be too <HI>deep</HI> for them! No, Sir, your <HI>Dialogues</HI> are ea&s;ie and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hallow enough; but <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> is as great
<PB N="v" REF="002194_0007_0FDAC8AC18DE16C0">a <HI>My&s;tery</HI> as ever: and I never thought that which the great Doctor of the Gentiles, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> adores as <HI>un&s;earchable,</HI> could be brought down level with the Capacity of a <HI>Plough man;</HI> or that a <HI>Plough-Man</HI> can &s;o ea&s;ily comprehend and under&s;tand the Decrees, and a&s;cend in a few Hours, tho&s;e eternal Mountains of Bra&s;s, which have always been inacce&s;&s;ible by the mo&s;t towring and exalted <HI>Genius</HI>'s. To hear <HI>Paul</HI> with an <HI>[O Altitu|do]</HI> in his Mouth; and a <HI>Plough-Man</HI> calling out, here St. <HI>Paul,</HI> I'll let you into the <HI>My&s;tery;</HI> there is no Difficulty in the Mat|ter. <HI>Le&s;ly</HI> &s;hall explain it you in a Minute. <HI>Paul! Le&s;ley</HI> will &s;et you to rights, and bring you to under&s;tand your own <HI>My&s;terious</HI> Wri|tings.</P>
<P><HI>They treat of that deep, but comfortable Doctrine, I mean the Doctrine of Election and Prede&s;tination.</HI> But then the Author limits his Meaning in a long <HI>Parenthe&s;is, (that Soul-piercing Doctrine to the Wick|ed and Unregenerate, but Soul-refre&s;hing, &amp; Heart-comforting Doctrine to the Saints, to all righteous and godly Folk.)</HI> Then it &s;eems, it is a <HI>Soul-piercing</HI> Doctrine to the wicked and unregenerate. It would be too Sa|tyrical and hard to argue the Author's <HI>Spiri|tual</HI> State and Character, from its being &s;uch a <HI>Soul-piercing</HI> Doctrire to <HI>him,</HI> that he can|not &s;o much as endure the Sound of <HI>Fore-or|daining, Fore-kowledge, Pre-de&s;tination;</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="002194_0008_0FDACA369BC010A0">mu&s;t have &s;ub&s;tituted in the Room of the&s;e <HI>Heart-piercing</HI> Words, <HI>De&s;tination, Know|ledge, Ordaining.</HI> O what a killing &s;yllable is <HI>[Pre]</HI> A Man had much better be <HI>de&s;tined</HI> to Hell, than <HI>prede&s;tined,</HI> &amp; had rather be <HI>known</HI> of God an Heir of Damnation, than be <HI>foreknown</HI> to be &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Now as to the Occa&s;ion of the Publication of the&s;e Dialogue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; Alas, Chri&s;tian! I fear there is too too great Occa&s;ion for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">em. The many pernicious (and I fear al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s!) Soul de&s;troying Books, &amp;c.</HI> Here I mu&s;t ask the Author's Pardon, when I &s;aid I could not find any Rea&s;on of his for the Publication of the&s;e Dialogues. No, here's a Rea&s;on, our Author perceives there are <HI>pernicious and Soul-de|&s;troying Books</HI> handed up and down the Country. But he mentions none of them, either by their Titles or in a way of Quotation; nor do I think any Number of Tractates <HI>of Prede&s;ti|nation</HI> (which is what the Author mu&s;t mean when he calls them <HI>pernicious and Soul-de|&s;troying Books)</HI> have been handed up and down. &V;pon all the Enquiries I have purpo&s;ely made even &s;ince the&s;e CHOICE <HI>Dialogues</HI> came out, I can hear of no &s;uch Thing. Which makes me believe, the Prefacer had a mind to rail, and could find no way to introduce him&s;elf upon the Stage, but raking up an old Story of <HI>Prede&s;tina|tion.</HI> I am &s;ure, I never found but the Country was as &s;ilent, and as di&s;engaged from any &s;uch Talk, as they are of the <HI>Millennium,</HI> or the next
<PB N="vii" REF="002194_0009_0FDACA381E026368"><HI>blazing Star,</HI> that is to appear. And I am &s;o much the more confirmed in my Opinion, in that the Prefacer without any Di&s;tinction, falls foul of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Clergy, e&s;pecially the <HI>younger Sort,</HI> charging them home with Ca|lumny and Slander. In&s;tead of intreating and inviting us to the Truth; what vile Reproaches and malicious Invectives is his <HI>Preface</HI> filled with again&s;t tho&s;e, who never did him any wrong in the World. &V;nder the &V;mbrage of <HI>Pre|de&s;tination,</HI> he takes Liberty to be as unmannerly and reproachful as he plea&s;es, till at lengeth one is almo&s;t &s;tunned with the Noi&s;e and Din of his clamorous, ungenteel and &s;currilous <HI>Rhap&s;odies.</HI></P>
<P>But it were endle&s;s as well as needle&s;s to take Notice of all his Cant and Jargon. He &s;ays, <HI>the&s;e Dialogues will rightly in&s;truct Men concerning the true Scripture Doctrines of Election and Prede&s;tination.</HI> So the Au|thor thinks, becau&s;e tis done <HI>ad Captum;</HI> el&s;e it might be <HI>too laborious a Re&s;earch</HI> for us. But we'll leave him in a good Conceit of his Piece, until we have gotten to the End of his learned Preface.</P>
<P>Yes, but they are <HI>Heart-enlightning Dia|logues.</HI> How is the <HI>Bible</HI> then the <HI>Be&s;t of Books,</HI> &s;ince the&s;e <HI>Dialogues</HI> may lay claim to that <HI>incommunicable</HI> Character of that <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Book,</HI> viz. <HI>Heart-enlightning?</HI> See P&s;alm <HI>19.7, 8. P&s;alm 119.50.</HI> What is the Diffe|rence between a <HI>converting, quickening,</HI> &amp;c. and an <HI>Heart-enlightening</HI> Dialogue? Strange
<PB N="viii" REF="002194_0010_0FDACA39F134CD40"><HI>Dialogues!</HI> that above all <HI>Objective Illumi|nation</HI> of the &V;nder&s;tanding, have a Power to reach the very <HI>Heart.</HI> A very powerful Word indeed: &mdash; But I forbear to fix any Con&s;equen|ces upon the Author, which he it may be ne|ver intended him&s;elf, when he a&s;&s;erted the&s;e <HI>Dialogues</HI> to be <HI>Heart-enlightening;</HI> and &s;hall only ob&s;erve he is more charmed with them than others are, to think them &s;o <HI>Divine,</HI> when <HI>humane Frailty</HI> betrays it &s;elf throughout almo&s;t the whole Compo&s;ure. But &s;hould I fix &s;uch <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> upon him, it would never equal his <HI>Impudence</HI> in in&s;inuating that we <HI>wor&s;hip the Devil. Vid. Pag. 2. Dial.</HI></P>
<P>Our Praefacer launches &s;till further and deep|er into the Elogies and Prai&s;es of the&s;e <HI>Heart|enlightening Dialogues;</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>They will &s;hew thee, what was the Opinion of the holy Martyrs of the Church in the fir&s;t and pure&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tianity, concerning the&s;e Doctrines. And O I am &s;ure we ought to follow them, them, I &s;ay, who were taught the Faith of Chri&s;t from the Mouths of the Apo&s;tles or Apo&s;tolick Men,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>rather than hearken to&mdash;that great Antichri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. Were the&s;e brave Men he talks of <HI>Martyrs</HI> for oppo&s;ing <HI>Calvin's</HI> Doct|rine of <HI>Praede&s;tination <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Was the Doctrine contained in his <HI>Choice Dialogues,</HI> the Truths for which they <HI>Dyed Martyrs, and Sealed with their Blood?</HI> Nay can he prove that the&s;e <HI>Ancient Fathers</HI> were of <HI>other</HI> Senti|ment;
<PB N="ix" REF="002194_0011_0FDACA3B18375358">than we upon the Head of <HI>Election?</HI> I am &s;ure the <HI>Dialogues</HI> don't prove it. No, Mr. <HI>Le&s;ly</HI> &s;ays, this is the <HI>ancient Apo&s;tolic</HI> Doctrine, but not one <HI>ancient Father</HI> quoted to his Purpo&s;e. But &s;ince our Praefacer has <HI>none</HI> of their Proofs on his &s;ide, we will by and by give him a few.</P>
<P>The&s;e great and glorious <HI>Martyrs,</HI> the <HI>Quin|te&s;&s;ence</HI> of who&s;e Faith in the Article of <HI>Elec|tion,</HI> our Author &s;uppo&s;es couched in his <HI>Choice Dialogues,</HI> were (if we may believe our <HI>Praefacer) taught the Faith of Chri&s;t from the Mouths of the Apo&s;tles or Apo&s;|tolick Men.</HI> Now, Gentlemen, we are come to the <HI>Rectilineal, and Uninterrupted Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of Epi&s;copacy, from the Apo&s;tles.</HI> Ay, and this Doctrine of the <HI>Choice Dia|logues</HI> has been in the &s;ame <HI>uninterrupted</HI> Manner, by <HI>oral Tradition</HI> handed down by the <HI>Clergy</HI> to this Day. By <HI>Oral Tradition,</HI> I &s;ay, for this our Author, quotes none of the <HI>Writings</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Apo&s;tolick Men,</HI> or their <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors.</HI> But why need our Praefacer run us up to the Doctrine which he &s;uppo&s;es the&s;e <HI>ancient Fathers</HI> received from the <HI>Apo&s;tles, and Apo&s;tolick Men?</HI> Does he think what <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> &amp;c. told to <HI>Ignatius, Her|mas the Pa&s;tor,</HI> &amp;c. more true, or more in|telligible, than what for the Benefit of the Church in all Ages, he left in <HI>Writing?</HI> Does he think <HI>Paul, or Peter,</HI> &amp;c. could &s;peak their Minds better to tho&s;e Men, than
<PB N="x" REF="002194_0012_0FDACA3C980D2E48">they could <HI>Write</HI> in their <HI>Epi&s;tles?</HI> We have <HI>Paul</HI> by us, the <HI>&s;ure Word of Prophe&s;y,</HI> which is enough to inform us what he thought, when he met with a <HI>My&s;tery,</HI> and when he did not. We know <HI>Paul</HI> wrote to the <HI>Romans</HI> Things <HI>un&s;earchable and pa&s;t finding out</HI> by any Mortal, not what is <HI>level with the Ca|pacity of every Plough-Man;</HI> I mean as to this Doctrine of <HI>Praede&s;tination.</HI> And here let me tell our Author, <HI>Paul's Writings</HI> are as valuable with me, nay more, &s;ince I am &s;ure he wrote under the Conduct and In&s;piration of the Holy Spirit, than a <HI>per&s;onal Interview</HI> with him. But I wi&s;h neverthele&s;s, the Prae|facer would Publi&s;h to the World what the&s;e brave Men were <HI>taught from the Mouths of the Apo&s;tles,</HI> relating to <HI>Praede&s;tination.</HI> The World will own in their thankful Ac|knowledgements their Obligations unto him.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion of the Clergy from the Apo&s;tles,</HI> I mean of <HI>Bi&s;hops Dioce&s;an,</HI> I never could &s;ee the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of them yet. It has hitherto been much &s;uch a Secret in Eccle&s;ia&s;tick State as is the <HI>Philo|&s;ophers Stone</HI> in the <HI>Kingdom of Na|ture;</HI> of which it is often a&s;&s;erted there is &s;uch a Thing in <HI>Rerum Natura;</HI> but we never can be certain any Body has been &s;o &s;agacious and &s;harp as to find it. But I drop the <HI>Chi|mera,</HI> and let it vani&s;h among the Shades.</P>
<P>But who is the <HI>Whore of Babylon, and the great Antichri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. It can't be the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> for that &s;poils the <HI>uninter|rupted
<PB N="xi" REF="002194_0013_0FDACA3E181FA0F0">Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> in Part, and I know it is the Mind of the Praefacer, that <HI>Rome</HI> is a great Arm of the <HI>Catholick Church.</HI> Who is <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> then which he means? Why, they are <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> whom our Author joyns wth the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who are a &s;mall Body, which I know the Praefacer thinks to be mainly intended in the <HI>Apocayp&s;e.</HI> And yet in a few Lines after he calls us <HI>Fellow-Chri&s;tians.</HI> They are <HI>Fellow-Chri&s;tians,</HI> and yet have they <HI>followed blindly,</HI> for &s;ome &s;cores of Years, <HI>blind Guides;</HI> nay, as in Conver&s;ation he will not &s;cruple to call them <HI>fal&s;e Brethren,</HI> and aver that they are no more <HI>Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t,</HI> than every <HI>Carter and Dray-man</HI> that pa&s;&s;eth the Street. How then can the <HI>Flocks</HI> of &s;uch <HI>fal&s;e Brethren,</HI> be any other than <HI>fal&s;e Churches,</HI> and degenerate Wolves; and are they then his <HI>Fellow Chri&s;tians?</HI></P>
<P>But it would tire <HI>Job</HI> to recount all the Contradictions, and Ab&s;urdities in his Prae|face. I &s;hall therefore animadvert but upon <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the <HI>Multitude. Let us follow the Example of the Primitive Church, and give Ear to tho&s;e pious and godly Fathers of the Church, who will teach us the Truth in Sincerity.</HI> To omit &s;o &s;mall a Critici&s;m as that, what is the Difference between <HI>[Pious]</HI> and <HI>[Godly,]</HI> as he &s;tiles the Fathers of the Church? for I always was &s;uch a No|vice, as to under&s;tand the &s;ame Thing b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Piety and Godline&s;s:</HI> I &s;ay, to omit that, let

<P>Now the Praefacer puts on an Air of Gravi|ty, and takes up a Lamentation. <HI>Here I can|not but take Notice of the &s;ad and deplora|ble Degeneracy of Mankind,</HI> &amp;c. Our <HI>Prae|facer</HI> is not at all guilty of this, when in the next Page, he in&s;inuates there is <HI>&s;carce a Book written by the Di&s;&s;enters, which has com|mon Sen&s;e in it, and they are not worth a Reading.</HI> And if wi&s;e Men refu&s;e to ca&s;t their Eyes upon his <HI>Choice Dialogues,</HI> he may conclude it is upon the <HI>&s;ame Su&s;picion,</HI> that they deny them the Honour of a Peru&s;al.</P>
<P><HI>Indeed,</HI> &s;ays the Praefacer, <HI>I have heard People &s;ay, that there is &s;carce one in Twen|ty of the Books written by</HI> Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>that have</HI> common Sen&s;e <HI>in them.</HI> He has <HI>heard</HI> &s;o, but who <HI>told</HI> him?

<P>Why then, friend John, I'll tell thee what; fir&s;t, thy M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ter thinks, he has Thanks to Con thee for the Honour and Service you have &s;o faithfully endea|voured for him, in maintaining, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Scotch Presbyterians,</HI> and all the Churches of <HI>New England,</HI> and all their Pa&s;tors <HI>wor&s;hip the Devil.</HI> The Devil's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> old Bla&s;phemer; Bla&s;phemies he loves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his Life, they are <HI>Melodies</HI> to him. The very fir&s;t Leaf of your Choice Dialogues repeats the&s;e Choice Bla&s;phemies.

<PB N="3" REF="002194_0027_0FDACA531AE4D3A0">a little hideous to me, as bad as People take me to be. But you had a Mind it may be, Jack, to have &s;omething more of the <HI>Hero</HI> in you, than your great Bro|ther <HI>She phard</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Your Ma&s;ter has given Demon&s;tration enough of his affecting the Throne of the mo&s;t high God. But really, friend John, you have done &s;omething even beyond his Ex|pectation, to claim it for him. Formerly he u&s;ed to value him&s;elf upon being the Object of all Wor&s;hip from the <HI>Japane&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Hottentots,</HI> and <HI>American</HI> Salvages. He never imagined that all the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> in the World, which amount to &s;everal Mil|lions, and a very di&s;tingui&s;hed and &s;uperi|or part of Mankind, are al&s;o his Wor|&s;hippers. I prote&s;t John, I am &s;o well acquainted with our Ma&s;ter, that I know he trembles before the God, whom the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> pray to.</P>
<P>But ava&s;t! I remember now King <HI>William</HI> was a <HI>Calvini&s;t.</HI> But &s;ure, it is not upon his account that you &s;o horribly bla&s;pheme the God he prayed to? For I remember, you never much liked him. O hungry and hardly be&s;tead, that you can't content your &s;elf with cur&s;ing the King, who&s;e immortal Memory, you and our Ma&s;ter abominate; but you mu&s;t look upward and cur&s;e his God too!</P>
<P>Look you, <HI>John,</HI> hitherto your Ma&s;ter
<PB N="4" REF="002194_0028_0FDACA5499CD3980">plea&s;ed him&s;elf with being <HI>the God of this World.</HI> But there is a Sett of People <HI>Called out of this World,</HI> who are continually lift|ing up their Cries to the <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> that he would quicken them to <HI>repent</HI> and <HI>believe;</HI> and who a&s;cribe to <HI>Sovereign Grace,</HI> the whole Glory of every good Thing per|formed by them in a Way of Living unto God. Now, John, the&s;e were the People of all the World, which your Ma&s;ter and mine gave over as lo&s;t; he has <HI>hue-in-cried</HI> them as Runaways, and has taken all Opportuni|ties to blacken them with &s;uch Pens as your's (that writes all his <HI>Adverti&s;ements</HI> for him) for <HI>Brutes</HI> and <HI>Brute-Makers;</HI> But it &s;eems by you, that the&s;e al&s;o are they, who <HI>fall down and wor&s;hip him.</HI> This is beyond what your Ma&s;ter him&s;elf ever imagined. He was in you, <HI>John,</HI> all the time you were a Scribling for him, tho' perhaps you were not aware of it. But how comes it, <HI>John,</HI> you're gone beyond his In&s;piration? You have plea&s;ed him won|derfully; For tho' he be a Spirit full of Envy, yet he is not &s;o envious, as to be di&s;|plea&s;ed when he &s;ees him&s;elf out-done in Devili&s;m. You mu&s;t not wonder at it, that when you &s;ay, the God of the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> is more cruel than the <HI>Devil,</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould applaud him&s;elf, for having a Man <HI>John,</HI> who bids &s;o hopefully to out-do his Ma&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I conclude this &s;mall Book, I flatter my &s;elf, it will not be di&s;a|greeable, nor unprofitable to &s;uch Readers, who have not Time and Lei&s;ure to enquire into the Merits of the Cau&s;e in this Controver&s;y of <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> if I fini&s;h my An&s;wer to the <HI>Choice Dia|logues,</HI> with the Con&s;ideration of the fol|lowing Heads.</P>
<P N="1">I. That the primitive Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> relating to the Arti|cle of <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> was <HI>Calvini&s;tical;</HI> and in this &s;en&s;e of the <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Reformers held that Article. I am not at pre&s;ent about to prove the Truth, &amp; the agreeablene&s;s of the&s;e Articles to the holy Scriptures; but only in Oppo&s;ition to our <HI>Dialogi&s;t,</HI> to &s;hew that he either does not know, or el&s;e fal&s;ifies, the true Tenets of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> The <HI>Church of England,</HI> (I &s;ay) for it matters not what the Church at pre&s;ent holds, but what the fir&s;t Reformers, and Founders thereof de|clared to be their Faith. That is the true Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> which was fir&s;t maintained, and not at all the le&s;s
<PB N="32" REF="002194_0056_0FDACA7E97BC37B8">for their having in a great Mea&s;ure fallen from it.

It is in the Po&s;tcript to his Letter. The Words are as follow.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I have oft heard, how &s;ome upon all occa&s;ions, have bitterly run at the <HI>Doctrine of Prede&s;tination,</HI> as if none main|tained &s;uch a Doctrine but we; And a <HI>Mi|ni&s;ter of your</HI> I&s;land, <HI>called it, A damnable Doctrine:</HI> and I now ju&s;tly wonder to re|ceive &s;uch a Character of <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> from &s;ome, that it is <HI>contrary to the Word of God, and a great di&s;couragement to Piety.</HI> Therefore I am now to produce the receiv|ed and approved Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> concerning <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> &s;ince the Reformation to this Day; and &s;hall begin with the 35 Articles agreed upon in a Con|vocation held at <HI>London</HI> 1552. in the Reign of <HI>Edw.</HI> 6. and frequently renewed and ra|tifyed in the following Reigns, and conti|nued the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed Doctrine</HI> of the Church to this day, which <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> with &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|lowed

<Q><HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> to life is the everla&s;ting purpo&s;e of God, whereby before the foundations of the World were laid, he hath con&s;tantly de|creed by his Coun&s;el, &s;ecret to us, to de|liver from cur&s;e and damnation, tho&s;e, whom he hath cho&s;en in Chri&s;t Je&s;us out of mankind, and to bring them by Chri&s;t to everla&s;ting Salvation, as ve&s;&s;els made to honour; wherefore they that be endued with &s;o Excellent a benefit of God, be called according to Gods purpo&s;e, by his Spirit working in due &s;ea&s;on, they thro' Grace obey the calling, they be Ju&s;tifyed freely, they be made Sons of God by A|doption, they be made like the Image of his only begotten Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they walk religiou&s;ly in good works, and at length by Gods mercy they attain to e|verla&s;ting felicity. As the Godly con&s;i|deration of <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> and our Electi|in Chri&s;t, is full of &s;weet, plea&s;ant and un&s;peakable comfort to Godly per&s;ons, &amp; &s;uch as feel in them&s;elves the workings of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, mortifying the works of the fle&s;h, and their earthly members, and drawing up their mind to high &amp; heavenly things, as well becau&s;e it doth e&s;tabli&s;h &amp; confirm their Faith of eternal Salvation, to
<PB N="34" REF="002194_0058_0FDACA81998B3AF8">be enjoyed through Chri&s;t, as becau&s;e it doth frequently kindle their Love to|wards God, &s;o for curious and carnal per|&s;ons, lacking the Spirit of Chri&s;t, to have continually before their eyes, the &s;entence of Gods <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> is a mo&s;t dange|rous downfall, whereby the Devil doth thru&s;t them either to de&s;peration, or in|to wretchle&s;sne&s;s of mo&s;t unclean living, no le&s;s perilous than de&s;peration. Fur|thermore we mu&s;t receive Gods promi&s;es in &s;uch wi&s;e, as they be generally &s;et forth to us in the holy Scriptures, and in our doing that will of God is to be followed, which we have expre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> declared to us in the Word of God.</Q> And as to the &s;en&s;e of this Article, take it from the Learned of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> Dr. <HI>Whitaker,</HI> in his <HI>Cygnia Cantio,</HI> page 16, 17. (Dr. <HI>Bridges</HI> &s;tiles this, <HI>The chiefe&s;t Article of the Church in Doctrine.</HI>) Mr. <HI>Thomas Rogers</HI> in his <HI>A|naly&s;is,</HI> bound up formerly with the Articles. Dr. <HI>Toy&s;ins</HI> in his Commentary on <HI>Lambeth Articles,</HI> fully explain this Article, and rai&s;e conclu&s;ions from it. 1 That there is a <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> of certain, men to eternal Life; a preterition, prede&s;tination, or <HI>Re|probation</HI> of certain men unto Death. 2. That this <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> is no manife&s;t, no open Decree, into the grounds and cau&s;es of which every mean capacity may dive, but a hid|den purpo&s;e, coun&s;el or decree of God, which
<PB N="35" REF="002194_0059_0FDACA8317A3C9D0">is kept <HI>&s;ecret</HI> from us. 3. That this <HI>Prede&s;|tination</HI> to life is from <HI>Eternity.</HI> 4. That is altogether <HI>immutable</HI> and unchangeable as God him&s;elf This is the e&s;tabli&s;hed Doct|rine which all the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ub&s;cribe or a&s;&s;ent unto at Ordi|nation.</P>
<P>The next demon&s;tration and di&s;covery of the Church in this point, is from the <HI>Lam|beth Articles,</HI> agreed upon at <HI>Lambeth</HI> Hou&s;e, by <HI>John</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury, Richard</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bangor,</HI> Dr. <HI>Tindall</HI> Dean of <HI>Elie,</HI> Dr. <HI>Whitaker,</HI> profe&s;&s;or of Divinity at <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI> with &s;everal learned Divines of the Church; with the approbation of <HI>Matthew,</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> compo&s;ed at fir&s;t in Latin, and &s;ent to the Univer&s;ity at <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI> to prevent and cru&s;h &s;ome <HI>Arminian</HI> Controver&s;ies that were beginning to be rai&s;ed there; yet I &s;hall give you in Engli&s;h Four of Nine, that relate to <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> never yet impeached or rejected by the Church, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the 39 Arti|cles, but in&s;erted in the <HI>Ireland</HI> Articles, &amp; allowed of in the conference at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court. 1. <HI>God from Eternity hath</HI> Prede&s;ti|nated <HI>certain men unto Life, certain men he hath Prede&s;tinated, or reprobated unto Death:</HI> 2. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>moving and efficient cau&s;e of</HI> Pre|de&s;tination <HI>unto Life, is not the fore-&s;ight of Faith or Per&s;everance, or good works, or of any thing in the per&s;ons</HI> Prede&s;tinated,
<PB N="36" REF="002194_0060_0FDACA84B8502728"><HI>but only in the good will and plea&s;ure of God.</HI> 3. There <HI>is a</HI> Prede&s;tinate number <HI>of Prede&s;tinate, which can neither be augment|ed nor dimini&s;hed.</HI> 4. Tho&s;e <HI>who are not Prede&s;tinated unto Salvation are nece&s;&s;arily damned for their Sins.</HI> This is more plain and particular, than any thing I have heard taught by <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and yet it is the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The next Te&s;timony from that Church for <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> is the Articles of <HI>Ireland,</HI> agreed upon by the Arch-bi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, and the Clergy of that Kingdom, in a Con|vocation held at <HI>Dublin,</HI> 1615. And &s;eeing they were <HI>Engli&s;h Divines,</HI> and a part of the <HI>Engli&s;h Church,</HI> under one King, they were received, approved and licen&s;ed by the Government, as agreeable to the 39 Articles, and al&s;o tho&s;e of <HI>Lambeth;</HI> there|fore I &s;hall record out of them what con|cerns <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> or the <HI>Decrees</HI> of God.</P>
<P>Art. 11. <HI>God from all eternity, did by his unchangeable Coun&s;el, ordain what&s;oever in time &s;hould come to pa&s;s, yet &s;o as thereby no violence is offered to the wills of the rea&s;onable Creatures, and neither the</HI> Liberty <HI>nor</HI> Con|tingency <HI>of</HI> Second cau&s;es <HI>is taken away, but e&s;tabli&s;hed rather.</HI></P>
<P>Art. 12. <HI>By the &s;ame eternal Coun&s;el, God hath</HI> Prede&s;tinated <HI>&s;ome unto Life, and</HI> Re|probated <HI>&s;ome unto Death, of both which there is a certain number known only to
<PB N="37" REF="002194_0061_0FDACA861B5CA380">God, which can neither be encrea&s;ed nor di|mini&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>13. Prede&s;tination unto Life, <HI>is the e|verla&s;ting purpo&s;e of God, whereby before the foundations of the World were laid, he hath con&s;tantly decreed in his Secret Coun&s;el, to deliver from cur&s;e and damnation, tho&s;e whom he hath cho&s;en in Chri&s;t, out of man|kind, and to bring them by Chri&s;t, to ever|la&s;ting Salvation, as ve&s;&s;els made unto ho|nour.</HI></P>
<P>14. <HI>The cau&s;e moving God to</HI> Prede&s;tinate, <HI>is not the fore-&s;eeing of Faith, or Per&s;eve|rance, or Good Works, or of any thing in the per&s;ons Prede&s;tinated, but only the good plea&s;ure of God him&s;elf, for all things being ordained for the manife&s;tation of his Glory, and his Glory being to appear, both in the works of his Mercy and Ju&s;tice, it &s;eemed good unto his heavenly wi&s;dom, to choo&s;e out a certain number toward whom he would extend his unde&s;erved Mercy, leaving the re&s;t to be Spectacles of his Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>15. <HI>Such as are</HI> Prede&s;tinated <HI>unto Life, be called according to Gods purpo&s;e, his Spi|rit working in due &s;ea&s;on, and thro' Grace they obey the calling, they be Ju&s;tified free|ly, they be made Sons of God by Adoption, they be made like the Image of his only begotten Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they walk religiou&s;ly in good Works, and at length by God's Mercy they attain to everla&s;ting felicity; but &s;uch as
<PB N="38" REF="002194_0062_0FDACA8797C674D0">are not</HI> Prede&s;tinated <HI>to Salvation, &s;hall final+ly be condemned for their Sins.</HI></P>
<P>16.
<Q>The Godly con&s;ideration of <HI>Pre+de&s;tination,</HI> and our <HI>Election</HI> in Chri&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> full of &s;weet, plea&s;ant, and un&s;peakable comfort to Godly per&s;ons, and &s;uch a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> feel in them&s;elves the workings of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, mortifying the works of the fle&s;h, and their earthly members, and drawing up their minds to high &amp; heavenly things, as well becau&s;e it doth greatly confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h their faith, of eternal Salvation, to be enjoyed thro' Chri&s;t, as becau&s;e it doth fervently kin|dle their Love towards God; and on the contrary &s;ide for curious and carnal per&s;ons, lacking the Spirit of Chri&s;t, to have continually before their Eyes, the Sentence of Gods <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> is very dangerous.</Q> This is the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of Ireland,</HI> and &s;o exactly agreea|ble to the 39 Articles, and tho&s;e of <HI>Lam|beth,</HI> that I need &s;ay no more of them.</P>
<P>Another di&s;covery of the Doctrine of <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> is from the Suffrages of the <HI>five Repre&s;entatives</HI> of the <HI>Church of Eng|land,</HI> at the Synod of <HI>Dort,</HI> Dr. <HI>Carleton</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> Dr. <HI>Samuel Ward,</HI> publick Divinity profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> Dr. <HI>Davenant</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> Dr. <HI>Bal|canquel</HI> Dean of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Thomas Goad,</HI> who were called and a&s;&s;embled to

In the Collect for <HI>All Saints Day,</HI> it begins, <HI>Almighty God, who ha&s;t knit together thine</HI> Elect <HI>in one com|munion, and fellow&s;hip in the my&s;tical Body of Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord.</HI> If God has an <HI>Elect|ed</HI> people, there mu&s;t &s;ome be <HI>left out,</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ed by,</HI> otherwi&s;e there can be no <HI>Election,</HI> or <HI>Choice.</HI> In the <HI>Catechi&s;m</HI> generally taught unto Children, in An&s;wer to Q 6.

<Q>As to the Order of <HI>Pre&s;cience</HI> and <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> there are &s;ome who &s;ay that the Fore-&s;ight of Good and Bad Works, or Merits is the Rea&s;on and Cau&s;e of Prede&s;tination, and Reprobation; In &s;uch &s;ort, that we are to conceive and think that God has Prede&s;tinated &s;ome becau&s;e he fore&s;aw they would do good Works, and would believe in Cari&s;t; and according to that Opinion, the &s;en&s;e of Text of the Apo&s;tle is this; Tho&s;e whom God <HI>fore&s;aw were to be conformed to the I|mage of his Son, they were the Per&s;ons whom he Prede&s;tinated.</HI> And it would be rea&s;o|nable &s;o to phra&s;e it, if Prede&s;tination had regard to <HI>nothing el&s;e</HI> but to <HI>Life Eternal</HI> be&s;towed upon us as the Reward of our Works.

Wherefore all that Grace which he di&s;tributes to Men, as preparatives to eternal Glory, in Time, he had prepared

Yea, &s;omtimes they &s;aid not what they thought, but what the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion compelled them to &s;ay, with re&s;pect to the diver&s;ity of <HI>Times</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> they had to do with. With regard to
<PB N="58" REF="002194_0082_0FDACAA59931EBB0">which latter, they deliver'd not the &s;ame Notions and Sentiments to the Vulgar and to the Learned. Sometimes the Fathers rhetoricate and declame, and then we mu&s;t not expect that things will be &s;poken exactly according to Truth. <HI>Jerom</HI> acknowledges concerning <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> that in &s;ome parts of his Writings he &s;peaks only <HI>Probably,</HI> and like a <HI>Retorician</HI> or <HI>Orator,</HI> for Argument &s;ake; and at other times he is <HI>Dogmatical</HI> and <HI>Serious,</HI> and clo&s;e to the purpo&s;e. But it is hard to tell when he delivers things one way, and when the other. <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> &s;aith of <HI>Gregory</HI> of <HI>Neocae&s;area,</HI> that he &s;pake &s;ometimes not <HI>dogmatically, but as in the heat of Di&s;pute.</HI> It is u&s;ual with &s;ome of the Fathers, e&s;pecially <HI>Chry&s;o|stom</HI> and his Imitator <HI>Theophylact,</HI> to a&s;&s;ert &s;uch and &s;uch an Opinion, to give &s;uch an Interpretation of a Text in Scripture, and then in another place to forget what they had &s;aid, and to a&s;&s;ert and Interpret in an other way, yea, &s;ometimes a quite con|trary one. So that it is difficult to know what is the Sen&s;e of the Fathers.</P>
<P>And when we know it, we cannot rely on it. For &s;ome of the Ancient Writers of the Church were Novices, and being
<PB N="59" REF="002194_0083_0FDACAA717AF52F0">but lately admitted into the Chri&s;tian Communion, were but meanly in&s;tructed in the Principles of it. Others of them, tho' of longer &s;tanding, were &s;ometimes very extravagant in their expounding of Scripture. They &s;train and wre&s;t the Text, and venture to add to the Words, or to conceal part of them, to prove the bu&s;ine&s;s they have undertaken, and to back the Opinions they have e&s;pou&s;ed So that no impartial Searcher of Truth will &s;wallow there groundle&s;s Interpretations. Nor is it to be forgot that &s;ome of the Fathers had been profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Philo&s;ophers,</HI> and thence bro't into Divinity &s;everal undue Notions &amp; Principles. Thus tis known that they we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Patrons of <HI>Free-Will,</HI> which they call <GAP DESC="foreign">, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp; other Names are given it by the Writers of the Church, the &s;ame which the <HI>Gentile Mora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ists</HI> make u&s;e of. Some of them intend only that Freedom of Will which I have a&s;&s;erted, that is a voluntary acting without Co-action. And of this parhaps <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> is to be under&s;tood in his <HI>Apology</HI> to <HI>Antonius Pius,</HI> where he a&s;&s;erts <HI>Free-will</HI> again&s;t <HI>Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> and u&s;es &s;everal Arguments for it. And &s;o doth <HI>Irenaeus</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="002194_0084_0FDACAA8BB454F30">in his Fourth Book <HI>against Heri&s;ies,</HI> Chap|ters 71, 72, 76, 77. <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> in his 6th Book of the <HI>Evengelical Preparation,</HI> proves from &s;undry Topicks, that Man is a <HI>Free-Agent,</HI> and argues again&s;t Fatal Nece&s;&s;ity. And &s;ometimes the Chri&s;tian Fathers &s;peak of Free-Will as to common Acts of the Mind, and natural Re&s;ults of Re|ligion, which no man of Rea&s;on will de|ny. And it is likely that &s;ometimes they under&s;tand it of a Free-Will to Good on|ly. But it is too apparent, <HI>that</HI> &s;ome of them a&s;&s;ert, <HI>that</HI> all Per&s;ons have an abi|lity to will either good or ill in Spiritu|als: They hold, <HI>that</HI> there is a Natural Power in every Man <HI>to will and to do what is acceptable to God.</HI> Therefore it is ob|&s;erved by the <HI>Centuriators</HI> of <HI>Magdeburg, that</HI> no Point of Doctrine began &s;o &s;oon to be ob&s;cured and corrupted, as this of the Nature of <HI>Free-Will;</HI> and they quote &s;ome of <HI>the Fathers</HI> of <HI>the Second Century</HI> as chargeable with this. So it is acknowledged by <HI>Calvin, that the Greek Fathers</HI> are not of his &s;ide in this Point; for they generally held, <HI>that</HI> all Men by Nature have a Free-Will to choo&s;e Good in Spiritual and Divine Things.
<PB N="61" REF="002194_0085_0FDACAAA17F295B0">And we may certainly gather this from a pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Irenaeus, viz.</HI> That it was part of the Here&s;ie of <HI>Saturninus,</HI> that &s;ome Per&s;ons are born without freedom to do Good; and this Writer argues again&s;t it, unle&s;s we &s;hall &s;ay (as was &s;ugge&s;ted before) that he &s;peaks of Free-Will only, as it denotes acting without com|pul&s;ion.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we cannot depend upon the <HI>Fathers,</HI> for they have err'd in many things, and it is endle&s;s to particularize. I have done &s;omething toward his in an other place. So that if we &s;hould grant (as perhaps we &s;afely may) that mo&s;t of the <HI>Greek Fathers</HI> had other Notions of God's <HI>Decrees, Free-Will, Grace,</HI> &amp;c. than I have offered, yet this is no Rule to us, unle&s;s we could prove that their Writings are void of Mi&s;takes and Errors. This can|not be done, and no Wi&s;e Man expects it. Yea, we know that many Points in Religion have been taught heretofore by the Fathers, and generally received and applauded, which after-Ages tho't it no immode&s;ty to lay a&s;ide and con|demn. Wherefore let not the <HI>Fathers</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="002194_0086_0FDACAAB9872CDE8">and <HI>Antiquity</HI> be pleaded in defence of the Doctrines which I have rejected.</P>
<P>My <HI>Second Propo&s;ition,</HI> is this, That the&s;e Points which I have been treating of, are plainly a&s;&s;erted and defended by &s;everal of the Fathers, even by tho&s;e of them who were the mo&s;t competent Judges of them. The <HI>Ab&s;olute Predesti|nation of a cortain number of Per&s;ons,</HI> which is tho't by &s;ome to be a novel Doctrine, was a&s;&s;erted and defended by St. <HI>Au|gustine.</HI> Yea, he tells us, that &s;ome of the Fathers before him, as well as &s;ome that were contemporary with him held the &s;ame (tho' they had not occa&s;ion to &s;peak of it &s;o directly and plainly) and he quotes Pa&s;&s;ages out of <HI>Cyprian, Ambro&s;e, Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ianzen,</HI> for this. <HI>Election</HI> without the fore&s;ight of good Works, is a&s;&s;erted by St. <HI>Jerom.</HI> And as for <HI>Pro&s;per, Fulgen|rius, I&s;idore</HI> of <HI>Sevil, Gregory</HI> the Great, learned Writers in the &s;ucceeding Centu|ries, it is well known that they went this way: Particularly <HI>Pro&s;per</HI> reckons it as the Doctrine of the favourers of <HI>Pelagius,</HI> that <HI>Election was upon fore&s;een Faith.</HI> And in the &s;ame place he mentions it as a|nother Error of theirs, that they held
<PB N="63" REF="002194_0087_0FDACAAD289C1288">the <HI>number of the Elect to be uncertain and undetermin'd.</HI> And <HI>I&s;idore</HI> expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erts a <HI>twofold Predestination,</HI> of the <HI>Elect unto Re&s;t,</HI> of the <HI>Reprobate unto Death.</HI></P>
<P>So the Opinion of &s;everal of the Fa|thers concerning Man's <HI>Free-Will</HI> &amp; God's <HI>Grace,</HI> is the very &s;ame that I have main|tain'd. St. <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> in many places of his Writings doth clearly and plainly a&s;&s;ert, the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of the <HI>Grace</HI> of the holy Spirit, in order to the performance of good Works, acceptable to God, and he depre&s;&s;es the power of <HI>Free-Will. Gre|gory Nazianzen</HI> doth in &s;ome part imitate him in one of his Poems, the 58th. And as the&s;e were the only Men of the <HI>Greek</HI> Fathers; &s;o <HI>Cyprian</HI> is the fir&s;t of all the <HI>Latin</HI> ones, that &s;peaks out concerning the Degeneracy and Infirmity of Man, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of Divine and Supernatural Grace. <HI>Lactantius</HI> is the next that plain|ly owns the&s;e, and St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> is the next after him, who fully and largely in|&s;i&s;ts upon the&s;e Points, and taught others afterwards to do &s;o.</P>
<P>This learned Prelate was as much for <HI>Free-Will</HI> as any Father, as his Books <HI>a|gainst

He frequently proves and inculcates, that this Faculty in every Man is by nature weak, di&s;abled and en&s;laved, and that it can't be healed, &s;trengthned, and freed, but by Divine Grace. <HI>What good can lost Man do,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>but only &s;o far as he is delivered from his Perdition?</HI> Again, <HI>The Will of Man &s;o far free, as it is Freed.</HI> Tho&s;e words of his in another place con|tain

<Q>I once occa&s;ionally di&s;cour&s;ed with that Excellent Per&s;on Sr. <HI>Robert Howard,</HI> who is better conver&s;ant than any Man I know, in the Doctrine of the <HI>Stoics,</HI> and he &s;et me right, from this concurrent Te&s;timony of Phylo|&s;ophers &amp; Poets, that <HI>Jupiter</HI> could not <HI>retard the Effects of Fate,</HI> even for a Mo|ment. For when I cited <HI>Virgil,</HI> as favouring the Contrary Opinion in that Ver&s;e, <HI>Tolle fuga Turnum atque in&s;tantibus cripe</HI> Fatis.
<PB N="73" REF="002194_0097_0FDACABC177BDF10">He replyed, and I think with exact Judg|ment, that when <HI>Jupiter</HI> gave <HI>Juno</HI> leave to withdraw <HI>Turnus</HI> from the pre&s;ent Danger, it was becau&s;e he foreknew, that his <HI>Fatal Hour</HI> was not come; That it was in <HI>De&s;tiny,</HI> for <HI>Juno</HI> at that Time to &s;ave him; And that <HI>Him&s;elf,</HI> viz. <HI>Juptter,</HI> obeyed <HI>De&s;tiny,</HI> in giving her, tha leave.</Q></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that <HI>Blind Fate,</HI> and <HI>Calvin|ni&s;tical Prede&s;tination</HI> are intirely oppo&s;ite; ina&s;much as the former is not &s;ubject to God him&s;elf; but this latter &s;uppo&s;es an holy, and righteous, wi&s;e, and Powerful Providence of God, who did him&s;elf or|dain the&s;e Events. So much for <HI>Fate.</HI></P>
<P>Another Blunder of the Dialogi&s;t is, that uis Notion of the <HI>Pre&s;entiation</HI> of all Things in the <HI>Divine Mind,</HI> de&s;troys and overthrows all the re&s;t of his Talk. For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all Things, which &s;hall be done to the End of all Time, are pre&s;ent in <HI>Idea</HI> with God, no <HI>Fate</HI> can be &s;urer and more ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Every Motion of Man, and eve|ry act of Volition, and every Sin, and e|very good Act is now pre&s;ent in the Di|vine Mind. And might not we reply a greeable to his An&s;wers to <HI>Calvin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> what I will, I do no more than is al|ready pre&s;ent with God; My Will is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|&s;itated
<PB N="74" REF="002194_0098_0FDACABD9DA0CEF0"> to this or that Thing, for it is all with God, as much as if I had already done it.</HI></P>
<P>Once more, he blunders prodigiou&s;ly in confounding the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Things decreed in the Divine Mind, with the Things them&s;elves in their actual or eventual <HI>Ex|i&s;tence.</HI> All Things are pre&s;ent with God, there is no <HI>Fore</HI> and <HI>After</HI> with God. We all acknowledge, that God Exi&s;ts in the mo&s;t perfect and incomprehen&s;ible Man|ner, he is Being it &s;elf [<HI>I am,</HI> that <HI>I am</HI>] and &s;o endures no &s;ucce&s;&s;ion properly &s;peaking, <HI>viz.</HI> no Succe&s;&s;ion which im|plies any Thing of Frailty or Change, which is to us inconceivable. Tho' Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> profe&s;&s;es he cannot under&s;tand the meaning of an Eternal <HI>Nunc Stans,</HI> (as the School-men phra&s;e it.) But we allow all Things pre&s;ent with God; yet we know they are &s;ucce&s;&s;ive with us. And how does this knock off the Fetters of Nece&s;&s;ity from <HI>Free will?</HI> If they be all pre&s;ent with God, and he beholds them with one intuitive View, what help is that to me? What God knows of me will prove true in the Event. And tho' all Things are pre&s;ent with God, they are &s;o only in <HI>Idea.</HI> For what I &s;hall do on the morrow, God knows; but God does not know (to &s;peak with humble Reverence) what I &s;hall do to morrow under the
<PB N="75" REF="002194_0099_0FDC6AE5F46014C0">Notion of a Thing actually accompli&s;hed. God therefore knows, this and that will be; but he does not know it as <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> until it be done. I am &s;ure, the Actions to be performed by <HI>John</HI> or <HI>James</HI> next Week, are not as yet performed. Unle&s;s you'll break thro' your own glori|rious Maxim, <HI>a Thing can't he, and not be at the &s;ame Time.</HI> God did not in, or from Eternity, know all Mankind <HI>actually born,</HI> but he knew they &s;hould be born. Thus we &s;ee this acute <HI>Metaphy&s;ician</HI> is &s;o clum&s;y as to confound the <HI>Idea's</HI> of Things Decreed with the Things them|&s;elves, actually Exi&s;ting.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not Tire the Reader to ob|&s;erve all the Incon&s;i&s;tences, of one, who is him&s;elf giddy, by rea&s;on of a rapid Motion of his Brains; and is &s;ometimes an <HI>Armini|an,</HI> &s;ometimes a <HI>Pelagian,</HI> and &s;ometimes a <HI>Calvini&s;t.</HI> His Motion is very much like that of the Planets, &s;ometimes <HI>Direct,</HI> and then <HI>Retrograde;</HI> and &s;ometimes, I profe&s;s he is <HI>Stationary.</HI> And this la&s;t is, when he &s;peaks nothing of <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> at all, as may be ob&s;erved in &s;ome Paragraphs of his Dra|logues.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with the&s;e two Remarks.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, He accurately and nicely ob&s;erves,
<PB N="76" REF="002194_0100_0FDBB9CB60477168">that the <HI>Church of England</HI> mentions <HI>not a word of Reprobation</HI> in all the 17th Article of <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> nothing of God's having <HI>Fore-decreed</HI> any to <HI>Mi&s;ery,</HI> but it &s;peaks only of tho&s;e, whom he has <HI>Elected to Sal|vation.</HI> What an unmerciful Piece of Non|&s;en&s;e is this! The Article &s;ays plainly, as we remarked before, that there are &s;ome <HI>Cho&s;en out of Mankind.</HI> And &s;o our Author would argue, there are none, which are not <HI>Cho&s;en.</HI></P>
<P>Poor Friend, &s;hould I tell thee, there are Twenty Men now before me, and I choo&s;e Ten of them to Work for me; it follows (does it not?) that all the Twenty la|bour for me, becau&s;e I make no Mention of the Ten, I pa&s;s by in my Election, whom I don't choo&s;e for the Employ. <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation</HI> are <HI>Relative</HI> Terms; if a Per&s;on choo&s;es out of any Number of Things, he likewi&s;e refu&s;es &s;ome of that Number.</P>
<P>Secondly. He is extreamly ignorant of the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> Tenets. Says he, <HI>Election is with them a Secret Decree, without any Re|&s;pect to our Works.</HI> Do but ob&s;erve either the Ignorance, or the Fallacy of our Dialo|gi&s;t. He would in&s;inuate, that we throw our &s;elves upon the Decree of God, and let what will come of Good Works. No,
<PB N="77" REF="002194_0101_0FDBB9BC4B0968B0">Sir, <HI>Election</HI> is without any <HI>Previ&s;ion,</HI> or antecedent Re&s;pect to Good Works; yet no Man &s;hall be S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ved without good Works. For he that ordained us to Life, ordained us to all the Preparatives hereof, one of which a <HI>continuance in the Way of Well do|ing.</HI> In the Decree of God we mu&s;t not &s;eparate the <HI>End</HI> from the <HI>Means.</HI> Both are equally parts of the Decree. God did not choo&s;e us becau&s;e he fore&s;aw we &s;hould be holy, but cho&s;e us that we might be holy. Holine&s;s is not the <HI>procuring Cau&s;e,</HI> but the <HI>Effect</HI> of the Decree. Ephe&s;. 1.4. <HI>According as he hath cho&s;en us in him; before the Foundation of the World, that we &s;hould be holy and without Blame before him.</HI> So that <HI>Election</HI> is not as he &s;ays, a <HI>Secret De|cree without any Re&s;pect to our Works,</HI> if we have re&s;pect to what we are <HI>Elected,</HI> even to <HI>holine&s;s,</HI> as well as in the End to <HI>Eternal Life.</HI> And now I may tell Friend Ca&s;ui&s;t, what the Apo&s;tle means when he bids us make our <HI>Calling</HI> and <HI>Election</HI> &s;ure. Says Friend with an haughty Air. <HI>What! Is not the Decree of God &s;ure without us!</HI> Yes, Sir, it is. But perhaps, I are felicitou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to know, If I am in this Decree. The Apo&s;tle gives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the Chain of Salvation, <HI>Whom he fore|knew, them he prede&s;tinated, whom he prede&s;|tinated, them he al&s;o called; whom he called, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ju&s;tified, &amp; whom he ju&s;tified, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words"> al&s;o glorified.</HI> If a man can by &s;elf-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">|mination

He may <HI>&s;earch and try</HI> him&s;elf, according to the Apo&s;tles Advice. And there are the Things which do <HI>accompany Salvation,</HI> as the Apo|&s;tle tells us in another place. We don't therefore in our Examinations begin with the Decree of God; but we begin with our own Souls. We know the <HI>Decree of God is &s;ure;</HI> but we are allowed to try our own Ca&s;e; yea, commanded in Scripture here|unto, and hereupon conclude of our Spiritu|al E&s;tate. If we make our <HI>Calling</HI> &s;ure (that is, if we by Examination find the Kingdom of Grace is e&s;tabli&s;hed in our Souls, &amp; that we are effectually called into the Fold of Je&s;us Chri&s;t) our <HI>Election</HI> is &s;ure. For whom he <HI>prede&s;tinates,</HI> them he al&s;o calls. Not but that many make a very bad u&s;e of God's Decrees, and neglect their Salvation; and of this the 17 Article makes mention, and well cautions again&s;t &s;uch a De&s;tructive Practice. For tho' God has decreed us to Holine&s;s, yet we are to ob&s;erve his <HI>revealed Will,</HI> which &s;trictly enjoins Holine&s;s &amp; Obe|dience, to &s;trive after it. We are not Brutes or Machines, what God has ordained us to, we &s;hall by his Grace &s;avingly incline thereunto. And no Man peri&s;hes mi&s;era|bly meerly becau&s;e of his <HI>Impotence to good;</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="002194_0103_0FDBB98FC273F9B8">but his natural <HI>Aver&s;ation and Enmity to good.</HI> There is no Unconverted Sinner but what hates a Life of Religion, let him in Words profe&s;s what he will. He chu&s;es the Path of the De&s;troyer, and tho' he may do &s;ome good Works, yet &s;ecretly wi&s;hes he had a Licen&s;e to Sin, and yet might be Sa|ved. So &s;uppo&s;e an <HI>Impotence</HI> to good only, and not this Enmity to God and Holine&s;s, is to beg the Que&s;tion. For to &s;nppo&s;e an impotent Penitent crying out, <HI>Lord, I be|believe, help my &V;nbelief!</HI> and God refu&s;ing his Grace to him, is more than any <HI>Calvi|ni&s;t</HI> will affirm. <HI>Chri&s;t will not break the brui&s;ed Reed, nor quench the &s;moaking Flax, but will bring forth Judgment to Victory.</HI> But then this &s;incere and truly Spiritual De&s;ire, is the ble&s;&s;ed Effect of <HI>Special Grace</HI> upon the Soul of the Sinner.
