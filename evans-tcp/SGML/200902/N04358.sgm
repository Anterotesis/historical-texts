<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Memory of her beloved Hu&s;band <HI>JOHN ESTAUGH,</HI> decea&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>_SINCE it plea&s;ed Divine Providence &s;o highly to fa|vour me, with being the near Companion of this dear Worthy, the Author of the following Sheets, I can|not be altogether &s;ilent, but mu&s;t give &s;ome &s;mall Account of the early Be|ginning of the Working of Truth in him. He was born in <HI>Keldevon</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> on the 23d of the 2d Month, 1676, of religious Pa|rents: But he grew unea&s;y with the religious Profe&s;&s;ions of both Father and
<PB N="iv" REF="005390_0003_10173186555EC788">Mother (they being of different Per|&s;wa&s;ions) and being a Seeker, &s;ell in with the <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> and liked them &s;o well he was near Joining them. But a Friend, a Neighbour, being dead, it &s;o happen'd, that he was invited to the Burial, where that worthy Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, <HI>Francis Stamper</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> being led to &s;peak with Life and Pow|er directly to his State, it made &s;uch deep Impre&s;&s;ions on his tender Mind, that put him upon Search into the Principles of Friends, and being fully &s;atisfied, joined with them in the &s;e|venteenth Year of his Age.</P>
<P>About the eighteenth Year of his Age, he came forth in the Mini&s;try, and being faithful he grew in his Gift, fo that in &s;ome Time he travelled to vi&s;it Friends in the North of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland:</HI> After which he was concerned to vi&s;it Friends in <HI>America,</HI> and having the Unity of the Brethren, embarked in the Year 1700, and was enabled by the great Hand that drew
<PB N="v" REF="005390_0004_101731355BC2CFC0">him forth, to perform that Service to the great Satisfaction of Friends, and the Reward of Peace in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Being then, and for &s;ome time after, freed from any Concern to travel in the Service of Truth, we were married to each other, <HI>viz.</HI> on the fir&s;t Day of the Tenth Month, 1702, and &s;ettled at <HI>Haddonfield</HI> in the County of <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter,</HI> and We&s;tern Divi&s;ion of the Province of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey.</HI> In the fore Part of his Time he travelled pretty much; but in the latter Part he was troubled with an Infirmity in his Head, which rendred him unfit for the Ser|vice; and his Good Ma&s;ter, that re|quires no Impo&s;&s;ibilities of his Servants, favoured him with being very ea&s;y at home; where, thro' Mercy, we lived very comfortably: For I'll venture to &s;ay, few, if any, in a married State, e|ver lived in &s;weeter Harmony than we did. Oh! he was a &s;weet Companion indeed! A loving tender Hu&s;band; an humble exemplary Man; a Pattern of
<PB N="vi" REF="005390_0005_10173187D97CD378">Moderation in all Things; not lifted up with any Enjoyments, nor ca&s;t down at Di&s;appointments. Oh! what &s;hall I &s;ay of him, but that he was a Man endowed with many good Gifts, which rendered him very agreeable to his Friends, and much more to me, his Wife.&mdash; My Lo&s;s is as far beyond my Expre&s;&s;ing, as is his WORTH.</P>
<P>Now after &s;ome Years (as before is ob&s;erved) of Indi&s;po&s;ition, it plea&s;ed the Lord to re&s;tore him to a State of Health; and &s;oon after he had a Con|cern to vi&s;it Friends at <HI>Tortola.</HI> This brought on him a deep Exerci&s;e, but when he was confirmed it was really required of him &s;o to do, he gave up to it; Home, and the Company there, which u&s;ed to be &s;o plea&s;ant to him, he was then weaned from. He fir&s;t wrote to them; but finding this would not excu&s;e him, he dur&s;t no longer de|lay, but go he mu&s;t. So, on the 13th of the 8th Month, 1742, we parted in the Aboundings of Love and Affection on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="005390_0006_10173138AF780DC8">
And now, the mo&s;t acceptable Ac|count I can give the Reader, of his Service in <HI>Tortola,</HI> is extracted from two Letters which I received from a Friend of that Place, directed to me, and to the Effect following, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>On the 8th of the 9th Month,</HI> 1742, <HI>he arrived at the Hou&s;e of</HI> John Picker|ing <HI>with his Companion</HI> John Cadwa|lader, <HI>where they were received with much Love and great Joy, being made to rejoice together in the tender Mercies and Love of God, which was greatly manife&s;ted that Day, to the Honour and Prai&s;e of his great Name, and al&s;o to the Comforting of his poor People.&mdash;The Te&s;timonies of the&s;e Servants of the Lord were with Life and Power, and were as Clouds fill'd with Rain upon a thir&s;ty Land.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>But to be more particular concerning thy dear Hu&s;band, who&s;e Memory is dear and precious to me, and many more who&s;e Hearts were open to receive the Glad Tydings which he brought. His godly
<PB N="viii" REF="005390_0007_1017313BAD0B24A8">Life and Conver&s;ation &s;poke him to be a true Follower of the Lamb, and Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom he freely preached, and by the effectual Power of who&s;e di|vine Love, was he called forth to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, for which we ble&s;s, prai&s;e and magnify the God of all our Mercies: And as a faithful Me&s;&s;enger, with much Love, in a tender Frame of Spirit, would be invite all to the Fountain which had healed him. O! the deep Humility that appeared in him in the Time of his publick Te&s;timony; and when in private Conver&s;ation with his near and dear Friends, as he often &s;aid we were to him, how chearful and plea&s;ant would he be, in that ble&s;&s;ed Freedom wherein Chri&s;t had made him free. Innocent, harmle&s;s, of a chearful Countenance, yet not with|out a Chri&s;tian Gravity well becoming the Doctrine he preached. He was va|liant for the Truth to the la&s;t, and tho' he is gone to his Grave, his Memory is &s;weet and precious.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He had his Health very well until the
<PB N="ix" REF="005390_0008_1017314197F383F8">Death of his dear Companion; but go|ing to his Burial, we were caught in a Shower of Rain, which we, and he, be|lieved was the Occa&s;ion of his Illne&s;s. However, he was mightily favoured with the Divine Pre&s;ence, which enab|led him to an&s;wer the Service of that Day; and the next, being the fir&s;t Day of the Week, we had a ble&s;&s;ed Meeting, the Lord's Pre&s;ence accompanying us; and tho' thy dear Hu&s;band was &s;o near his End, his Candle &s;hin'd as bright as ever, and many that beheld it, were made to glorify God on his Behalf. This was the la&s;t Opportunity on this I&s;land, &s;ave his Farewell upon his dying Bed, where he both preached and prayed, a little before his Departure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>On the next Day, being the &s;econd of the Week, he went to a little I&s;land cal|led</HI> Jos Vandicks, <HI>accompanied with &s;e|veral Friends; but on the 3d day in the Morning he complained very much, yet was enabled to go to Meeting, where were a pretty many People waiting to
<PB N="x" REF="005390_0009_10173140127599E8">hear the Word of Life declared, and a ble&s;&s;ed Opportunity we had together, to the tendring and melting our Hearts in|to a heavenly Frame.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But he, who never &s;pared his Labour whil&s;t among&s;t us, extending his Voice as a Trumpet of the Lord's own &s;ound|ing, was &s;o inwardly &s;pent he was ready to faint. However, he went on board the Sloop that Afternoon, and next Mor|ning came a&s;hore at our Hou&s;e; where he had not been long before a &s;hivering Fit &s;eized him, and a Fever &s;oon follow|ed, which kept its con&s;tant Cour&s;e every Day. This being the 1&s;t day of the 10th Month, he took great Notice that it en|ded Forty Years &s;ince his Marriage with thee; that during that Time you had lived in much Love, and parted in the &s;ame; and that thou wa&s;t his greate&s;t Concern of all outward Enjoyments. And tho' the la&s;t two Days he was in much Pain, yet he was pre&s;erved under it in much Patience and Re&s;ignation, and had his perfect Sen&s;es to the la&s;t, exhorting
<PB N="xi" REF="005390_0010_10173148F7A9F448">Friends to Faithfulne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And on the 6th Day of the 10th Month, about 6 a Clock at Night, he went away like a Lamb, with Prai&s;es and Thank&s;givings in his Lips but about two Minutes be|fore.</HI>&mdash;Thus far from the &s;aid Letters.</P>
<P>And thus fini&s;hed this dear Worthy in the 67th Year of his Age, at the Hou&s;e of <HI>William Thomas</HI> on the I&s;land of <HI>Tortola;</HI> highly favour'd by his great and good God in the very extreme Moments; the Con&s;ideration whereof, and the Account given of his Service, afford me, at times, &s;ome Relief; but, alas! my Wound is &s;o deep, nothing but the healing Balm from above can effect my Cure. My Lo&s;s is inexpre&s;&s;ible; yet &s;ince it is the Will of the Almighty, it becomes me to &s;ubmit, tho' it be hard &s;o to do.</P>
<P>Oh! a &s;weet and ble&s;&s;ed End indeed to go away as in Raptures of Life, ga|thered by the Almighty as a choice Flower, in full Perfection and Fragran|cy! For &s;ure, few, if any Man, ever
<PB N="xii" REF="005390_0011_101731895F0C1AD8">left a &s;weeter Savour, both at home and abroad, than he has done: Having li|ved belov'd, is gone lamented in gene|ral; and therefore it is no Wonder that I, who am &s;o much the greate&s;t Lo&s;er, lament and bemoan my great, my great Lo&s;s! And yet in the Mid&s;t of all, I have a &s;ecret Satisfaction in that I was enabled to give him up (tho' &s;o dear to me) unto the Service into which he was called. This is but ju&s;t a Hint for tho&s;e who may be under the like Exerci&s;e and Tryal, that they may not hold back, but &s;ubmit, and freely give up their All, leaving the Con&s;equence to the wi&s;e di&s;po&s;ing Hand, who knows for what Cau&s;e it is He is plea&s;ed &s;o nearly to try his People, &s;ome with Life it&s;elf, others near it, and the Cau&s;e yet hid.</P>

<HEAD>THE TESTIMONY Of FRIENDS of the Monthly Meeting of <HI>Haddonfield,</HI> con|cerning our dear Friend JOHN ESTAUGH, decea&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>_OUR worthy Friend having been a faithful Labourer in the Work of the Go&s;pel among&s;t us great Part of <HI>Forty Years;</HI> and many of us knowing by Good Experience the Ef|fects of his Service, we find our&s;elves engaged to give in this Te&s;timony on his Behalf, <HI>viz.</HI> That by and thro' the Divine Virtue and Power by which he was fir&s;t reached and wrought upon,
<PB N="xiv" REF="005390_0013_1017318AE7729E18">he was early called to the Work of the Mini&s;try, and made a cho&s;en Ve&s;&s;el fit|ted to hold the heavenly Trea&s;ure which dwelt plentifully in him. A true Go&s;|pel Mini&s;ter, dividing the Word aright; his Doctrine at Times having dropped as Dew, and his Speech di&s;tilled as the &s;mall Rain upon the tender Plants, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.2.

<P>He was zealous for pre&s;erving good Order in the Church; and for main|taining Love and Unity, that Badge of true Di&s;ciple&s;hip.</P>
<P>Oh! we are &s;en&s;ibly and &s;orrowfully

<P>DEAR Friends, as it hath been the Lord's Love which took hold on my Mind, and drew me forth from you, to vi&s;it his People in other Parts, &s;o it's from a Sen&s;e and Feeling of the &s;ame heavenly Spring of the Father's Love, in

And that this heavenly Mind may grow and increa&s;e in you, is what I am
<PB N="86" REF="005390_0085_101731F818CCC910">often concerned for; that as ye have entered into the Way and Path of Life, you may be pre|&s;erved therein, and feel your growth to be in Chri&s;t the Li|ving Vine;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 15.</NOTE> and where that is witne&s;&s;ed, the good Fruits are not wanting: For whoever grows in Chri&s;t, grows in all Holine&s;s of Life; for what is received from him, is of a holy, pure and divine Nature; purging to the puri|fying of the Con&s;ciences of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12.12.</NOTE> with many others, and by the one Spirit have been baptized together as into one Body:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10.4.</NOTE> And have drank at the one Heavenly Divine Spring, and united together in that pure Love which flows from God, thro' Chri&s;t, to true Believers; and great was that Care which came upon you, for the Main|taining of that Love and Unity which Truth had brought you into; and when anything appear|ed, which &s;truck thereat, how readily did you then joyn Hand in Hand, to get that ca&s;t out from among&s;t you, which had &s;o ill a Tendency in it.

<P>And dear Friends, if the &s;ame Care be continued, you'l then feel the Lord will not be wanting to &s;upport you in what tends to his Honour;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. 34.15.</NOTE> for his Eyes are upon the Righteous, and his Ears are open to their Cry. And for their Help he will ari&s;e, and what is wrong mu&s;t be judged down by him. Therefore, let not any give Way to favour any thing which is from under the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, for tho&s;e who would favour the Cau&s;e of &s;uch as are not wil|ling to bear the Yoke, will thereby hurt them&s;elves, and bring a Vail of Darkne&s;s over their own Under&s;tandings, and if Darkne&s;s prevails, Love will wax cold to Brethren, and that
<PB N="89" REF="005390_0088_10170FB81250C050">Care for maintaining Love and Unity will be lo&s;t, and in&s;tead thereof, Bitterne&s;s gets up, and hard Speeches are uttered, and grievous Reflections pa&s;t on them who cannot give Way for any thing to be countenan|ced or encouraged in the Church of Chri&s;t, but what is con&s;i&s;tent with his Will who&s;e dwelling is in Holine&s;s,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hab. 1.13.</NOTE> and is of purer Eyes, than to behold any Evil with Allowance.</P>
<P>Wherefore, my dearly beloved Friends, be all careful to keep a &s;trict Watch, each over his own Mind; that nothing that's wrong may get up, to harden your Hearts or darken any one's Under&s;tanding which God hath open'd; &amp; i&s; the Watch be well kept up at home, and no evil thing incouraged there, then, &s;uch will become more and more in the Lord's Hand, as

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 1.7.2.2.</NOTE> that's going about &s;eeking whom he can devour, and he is not without his wicked and evil In&s;truments, by whom he is working: And as is their Ma&s;ter, &s;o are they, full of Subtilty, and often under a &s;eeming Shew of Goodne&s;s, and a feigned Humility, gain upon the Minds of &s;ome, and get a Place in their Affections; which being once fixed is hard to move; and &s;o it proves, ma|ny

<P>Wherefore, Dear Friends, in order that That and all other Dangers may be avoided, let every one keep clo&s;e to the Gift and Mea&s;ure of Chri&s;t's Spirit in him&s;elf, again&s;t which no Device or Inchantment of the Enemy can ever prevail: For if we are deceived, it's for want of keeping a &s;ingle Eye to our holy &amp; heavenly Guide, Chri&s;t Je&s;us; to whom, for all the Mercies we enjoy, be Glory and Prai&s;e for ever.</P>
<P>And, dear Friends, as to my Travels, I may with Comfort &s;ay, the Lord hath been with me in this my Service and La|bour of Love to his People, &s;o that my Way has been made

<P>Soon after, this good Ac|count was received, our much e&s;teemed and well beloved Friend, <HI>Thomas Chalkley,</HI> was in the Love of God drawn to vi|&s;it you, and after his Arrival there, he gives an Account to his Wife, not only of his kind Reception, but al&s;o con|firms the above good Account: And likewi&s;e takes notice, how the Lord had ble&s;&s;ed his La|bour of Love, and made his

But we hear, that the Lord &s;aw meet in his Wi&s;dom to take this worthy In&s;trument to him&s;elf, and though it may to you, and us, look as a Lo&s;s to the Church, yet as it was con&s;i&s;|tent with his divine Will that it &s;hould be &s;o, it becometh us to be ea&s;y and content there|with, and now rather to look to our own &s;tanding, that we may through Faith and true Obedience maintain a Hold and

<P>But, prai&s;ed be his holy Name, he hath highly favour|ed you, in that he hath not only called to you, but even taken you as by the Hand, and led ye out of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and as with <HI>David,</HI> pluckt your Feet out of the Mire and Clay,

<HEAD>A SECOND EPISTLE <HI>Prepared by</HI> JOHN ESTAUGH, <HI>for Friends at</HI> Tortola, <HI>but not &s;ent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DEAR Friends, I have received by our worthy Friend, <HI>William Thomas,</HI> three Letters, viz. one from my e&s;teem'd Friend <HI>John Picke|ring,</HI> one from <HI>Jeremiah Mar|tin,</HI> and one from <HI>Fat-Hog Bay</HI> &s;igned by nine Friends, all which are very kindly re|ceived, and truly acceptable to
<PB N="111" REF="005390_0110_10173265906A4D10">me; and by them I under&s;tand, you had received my Epi&s;tle &s;ent via <HI>Antigua,</HI> directed to our afore&s;aid Friend <HI>J. Picke|ring;</HI> and by him I under&s;tand, it was read at the Clo&s;e of a publick Meeting, and was to the Edification and Com|fort of tho&s;e pre&s;ent, which I am glad of, and al&s;o to hear, that our heavenly Father was &s;o graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed at the Reading thereof, to favour you, with the Renewings of his Divine Goodne&s;s, in opening the free Spring of Life among&s;t you, &s;o that the Thir&s;ty in <HI>I&s;|rael</HI> were refre&s;hed, and could &s;ing to the holy Rock, and rejoyce in the God of their Sal|vation; and being afre&s;h bap|ti&s;ed and influenced with a re|newed Sen&s;e of the Life and Virtue of Truth, were therein and thereby led (I doubt not)
<PB N="112" REF="005390_0111_101732B73609D8D8">to renew your Covenants with the Lord, and to take up fre&s;h Re&s;olutions, and to hope, through Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, ye &s;hould never &s;hrink, or turn your Backs of what the Lord hath &s;hewn, or manife&s;ted to you, to be your Duties to him; but were ready to conclude, with good old <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jo&s;. 24.15.</NOTE> let o|thers Choice be as it will, as for you, ye will &s;erve the Lord.</P>
<P>And now, Oh! ye tender and beloved Ones of Chri&s;t Je|&s;us, in order that the&s;e pious and godly Re&s;olutions may be kept to, keep ye under a clo&s;e and &s;trict religious Exerci&s;e, waiting to feel the Operation of the holy Power of God in your Hearts, and then in his divine Light, you &s;hall not on|ly &s;ee your own Weakne&s;s, but for your Comfort, &s;hall al&s;o behold Chri&s;t, on whom help

And as Bread natural is to the natural Man called the Staff of Life, or is that on which the natural Life depends, &s;o long as the Lord in his di|vine Wi&s;dom may &s;eem meet to allow a Being here, (For this outward Bread cannot be any other ways &s;erviceable to that noble Part, the Soul in Man, than to &s;upport the out|ward Tabernacle, in which &s;he
<PB N="114" REF="005390_0113_101732B8C11A7C68">is allowed a Being for a little Space) &s;o the Bread, the Soul is to live upon, and which is to be daily &s;ought and prayed for,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 6.51. &amp;c.</NOTE> is the living Bread, which comes down from God out of Heaven: And is the holy Staff of Life, whereon every true Member in the Church of Chri&s;t, may &s;afely tru&s;t and lean upon, without the lea&s;t Danger of being deceived by it; nor hath it ever been known to fail any, tho' the lea&s;t of the Servants of God, who hath &s;tood up faithfully for the Cau&s;e of the holy Truth, choo&s;ing to &s;uffer the greate&s;t Cruelties that Man could inflict upon them, rather than to deny Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Oh! it was this divine Power from God, in and by which our antient and worthy Friends were &s;upported in the fir&s;t Ap|pearance
<PB N="115" REF="005390_0114_1017326B81BD4830">in the dark World: and as the Work, they were called to, was very great, the Lord did in Proportion thereunto fit them with Life and Power, and in the Name, and with Authority of the King of Kings, and Lord of Heaven and the whole Earth, they were led to proclaim the
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 17.3.4.5.</NOTE> Downfall of the great Whore, and fal&s;e Church, which <HI>John</HI> &s;aw cloath'd with Scarlet and Purple, and &s;itting upon the Scarlet-covered Bea&s;t, having a Golden Cup in her Hand, full of Abominations and Filthine&s;s of her Fornication; and upon her Forehead was a Name written, My&s;tery, <HI>Babylon</HI> the Great, the Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth.

<PB N="117" REF="005390_0116_1017326D06D2BFF8">their Goods; bani&s;hed Hu&s;|band from Wife, and Wife from Hu&s;band, and all for their faithful Obedience to Chri&s;t; But all this was not able to di&s;courage tho&s;e truly begot|ten and faithful Servants of God; for being filled with the divine Life of Je&s;us they bore all things with Meekne&s;s; &s;ub|mitting their Cau&s;e to God: And were not at all deterr'd, or any ways affrighted, or put by their Duty and Obedience to Chri&s;t: But faithfully follow|ed him, and his Regard was to them; and in the Enjoyment of his divine Love and Life, could in the Pri&s;on and dark Dungeons &s;ound forth living Prai&s;es to the mo&s;t high God, e&s;teeming it as a Ble&s;&s;ing that they were thought worthy to &s;uffer for Chri&s;t's &s;ake; and when the Lord had let their

<P>And now, you tender and beloved ones, if it &s;hould be your Lots to be in &s;ome things tried a little for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, yet be not di&s;courag'd, but &s;tand faithful to your great Lord and Ma&s;ter, who is &s;till as able as ever to carry on the Work which he hath begun, and will not fail to relieve and comfort his humble and faithful Follow|ers, who are chearfully given up to be order'd and directed &s;o as may be con&s;i&s;tent to his Divine Will: And may the Lord be with you all, and increa&s;e your Faith and Hope in him, is the De&s;ire
