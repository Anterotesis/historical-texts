<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By a very great Writer of very Little Books.</BYLINE>
<P>MUCH might be &s;aid in favour of this collection, but as we have no room for critical di&s;qui&s;itions, we &s;hall only ob&s;erve to our readers, that the cu&s;tom of &s;inging the&s;e &s;ongs and lullabies to children is of great antiquity. It is even as old as the time of the ancient <HI>Druids. Garacta|cus,</HI> King of the <HI>Britons,</HI> was rocked in his Cradle in the I&s;le of <HI>Mora,</HI> now called <HI>Angle&s;ea,</HI> and tuned to &s;leep by &s;ome of the&s;e &s;oporiferous &s;onnets. As the be&s;t things, however, may be made <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;e of, &s;o the kind of compo&s;i|tions has been employed in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> When that
<PB N="vi" REF="049118_0003_10265B94F3FC0F48">great prince turned his arms again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> he compo&s;ed the following march to lead his Troops to Battle, well knowing that Mu&s;ic had often <GAP DESC="music">
<PB N="vii" REF="049118_0003_10265B94F3FC0F48">the power of in&s;piring courage, e&s;pe|cially in the minds of good men. Of this his enemies took advantage, and, as our happy nation, even at that time, was never without a faction, &s;ome of the male contents adopted the follow|ing Words to the King's own March, in order to ridicule his Maje&s;ty, and to &s;hew the Folly and Impo&s;&s;ibility of his Undertaking.</P>
<Q><L>There was an old woman to&s;s'd in a blanket,</L>
<L>Seventeen times as high as the moon;</L>
<L>But where &s;he was going no mortal could tell,</L>
<L>For under her arm &s;he carried a broom.</L>
<L>Old woman, old woman, old woman, &s;aid' I!</L>
<L>Whither, ah whither, ah whither, &s;o high?</L>
<L><HI>To &s;weep the cobavebs from the &s;ky,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And I'll be with you by and by</HI></L></Q>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="049118_0004_10265B996C729210">
Here the king is repre&s;ented as an old woman, engaged in a pur&s;uit the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and extravagant imagin|able; but when he had routed the whole <HI>French</HI> army at the battle of <HI>Agincourt,</HI> taking their king and the flower of their nobility pri&s;oners, and with ten thou&s;and men only made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of their kingdom; the very men, who had ridiculed him be|fore, began to think nothing was too arduous for him to &s;urmount, they therefore can celled the former &s;onnet, which they were now a&s;hamed of, and &s;ub&s;tituted this in its &s;tead, which, you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, goes to the &s;ame tune.</P>
<Q><L>So va&s;t is the prowe&s;s of <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI></L>
<L>He'll pluck a hair from the pale-face moon:</L>
<L>Or a lion familiarly take by the tooth,</L>
<L>And lead him about as you lead a baboon.</L>

All princes and potentates under the &s;un,</L>
<L>Through fear, into corners and holes away run;</L>
<L>While nor dangers nor dread his &s;wift progre&s;s retards,</L>
<L>For he deals about kingdoms as we do our cards.</L></Q>
<P>When this was &s;hewn to his maje&s;|ty, he &s;milingly &s;aid, that folly always dealt in extravagancies, and that knaves &s;ometimes put on the garb of fools, to promote, in that di&s;gui&s;e, their own wicked de&s;igns. <Q>The flattery in the la&s;t, &s;ays he, is more in&s;ult|ing than the impudence of the fir&s;t, and to weak minds might do more mi&s;chief; but we have the old pro|verb in our favour: <HI>If we do not flatter our&s;elves, the flattery of others will never hurt us.</HI></Q></P>
<P>We cannot conclude without ob|&s;erving,
<PB N="x" REF="049118_0005_10265B9AF9CBE218">the great probability there is, that the cu&s;tom of making <HI>Non&s;en&s;e Ver&s;es</HI> in our &s;chools was borrowed from this practice among the old <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> nur&s;es; they have, indeed, been always the fir&s;t preceptors of the youth of this kingdom, and from them the rudiments of ta&s;te and learning are naturally derived. Let none there|fore &s;peak irreverently of this ancient maternity, as they may be con&s;idered, as the great grandmothers of &s;cience and knowledge.</P>
