<HEAD>Pure and Spiritual Wor&s;hip: A SERMON.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Preached at</HI> Devon&s;hire-Hou&s;e, <DATE><HI>Novem.</HI> 12, 1690.</DATE></HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN CRISP.</BYLINE>
<P>THE Wor&s;hip of God, of the Great God, is Pure; he is a Holy God, <HI>Of Purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity;</HI> and all they who will Wor&s;hip God, who&s;e Souls are breathing to have a Return of a Te&s;timony in his Sight, mu&s;t offer up pure Wor|&s;hip, and it mu&s;t come from that which is pure: For that Purpo&s;e the Greatne&s;s of the Love of God is made manife&s;t in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and there is a dif|fu&s;ing of his Grace and Virtue in the Hearts of the Sons and Daughters of Men, whereby he hath laid a Foundation for his own Wor&s;hip; becau&s;e his Wor&s;hip mu&s;t be pure. Therefore he hath freely given unto us, through his Son, the Knowledge of that pure Principle of Life and Grace, from whence and out of which, all true Wor&s;hip doth &s;pring, and all true Honour to God ari&s;eth, and real Obe|dience to his holy Will &s;prings forth out of that which is from him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And therefore all that will be Wor&s;hipers of God aright, mu&s;t fir&s;t know and be &s;en&s;ible wherein the Ability and Capacity &s;tands, that may enable them to &s;o great and &s;o good a Work. Some have conceived it to &s;tand in their own Will, and ac|cording to the Working of their own Will, they have framed Wor&s;hips, Religions, and Ob&s;ervati|ons, thinking thereby to plea&s;e God: But you know the Apo&s;tle in a few &s;hort Words lays down a po&s;i|tive Chri&s;tian Doctrine, <HI>Without Faith it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to plea&s;e God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="010868_0004_0F851A8CB13605C0">
Now this doth declare and &s;ignify, that there mu&s;t be &s;omething upon which this Faith mu&s;t work, that mu&s;t be the Object and Foundation of it: Faith as it worketh in the Creature, worketh upon &s;omething; it lays hold upon &s;omething in which there is a Capacity of plea&s;ing God. Now if <HI>we are all by Nature Children of Wrath,</HI> and that no one of him&s;elf can plea&s;e God, then there mu&s;t be &s;omething that is &s;upernatural that mu&s;t be the Object of that Faith, by which Men alone can plea&s;e God; and this mu&s;t be made manife&s;t to the Creature for its Help, for to be its Director and Supporter in that Work, that is too mighty for him&s;elf, too great a Work for a Man or Woman, too deep, too pro|found for any Man's Abilities, Power, Wi&s;dom, and Acquirements, that he can attain to in this World, to wor&s;hip God aright: To wor&s;hip God, that is, to perform a pure Wor&s;hip to a pure God; <HI>Who can bring a clean Thing out of an unclean?</HI> Now if we are all obliged to bring a clean Wor&s;hip, a pure Wor&s;hip to a pure and Holy God, who hath cre|ated us and all Things; where &s;hall we have it? Not out of an unclean Heart, not out of a defiled Mind; there is no bringing it forth from thence, for that is the State and Condition that Men are fallen into by Sin, in which their Minds and Con&s;ciences are defiled, their Hearts are polluted, and their Af|fections depraved and &s;et upon wrong Objects; and in this State none can &s;erve God aright: That which is pure and holy mu&s;t be fir&s;t made known, revealed, di&s;covered and believed before People can perform a right Wor&s;hip to God.</P>
<P>And therefore in vain it is, to go and drive Peo|ple to this and that Wor&s;hip, and force People to this and that Service and Conformity, upon the Ac|count of the Wor&s;hip of God. This is vain Wor|&s;hip; when they have done all, it is not acceptable
<PB N="5" REF="010868_0005_0F851A8D689C60A8">
to God; the poor Creature hath no Return from the Lord, for God accepts no Service or Wor&s;hip, but only thro' his Son. And if &s;o be, Men cannot pray and preach in the Spirit of his Son, and cannot pre&s;ent their Complaints and Supplications to God, but by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Help of his ble&s;|&s;ed Spirit, there is no Rea&s;on in Religion why Peo|ple &s;hould expect a Return and An&s;wer from God of the Prayers they make: For it is the general Doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> That Chri&s;t Je&s;us is ap|pointed of God for a Mediator between God and Man, and all the Acceptance we have, or de&s;ire to have, mu&s;t be through him: and therefore if we pray without him, and perform this and the other Dutys without him; it is contrary to the Doctrine of Chri|&s;tianity to think that ever we &s;hould have Accept|ance in God's Sight.</P>
<P>Therefore there is a Nece&s;&s;ity for every Man and Woman that de&s;ires to be religious, that hath a re|ligious Mind, and is willing to wor&s;hip God, and &s;erve God aright, there is a Nece&s;&s;ity that they come to the Knowledge of Chri&s;t, who tells us that he is <HI>The Way to the Father:</HI> They that go any other Way, go a wrong Way; but they that go unto God by Chri&s;t, they do receive from him Power to draw near to God; and through him they receive from God all tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings that their Souls &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>So here would be an End of all Religions the World is full of, of all the &s;everal Wor&s;hips that Men have made: They have invented and found out &s;everal Ways for People to wor&s;hip and &s;erve God: This and the other Ceremony, this and the other Ob&s;ervation and Method of Preaching and Praying: If all this be without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Divine Help of the Mediator, thro' whom alone we can ju&s;tly expect Acceptance at God's Hands, it is all good for nothing. Therefore the fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on of
<PB N="6" REF="010868_0006_0F851A8EF51D4270">
a Chri&s;tian in Point of Wor&s;hip, is that he come to the Knowledge of Chri&s;t, by whom, and thro' whom he may expect Favour with God.</P>
<P>Now &s;ay &s;ome People, We are already come to the Knowledge of Chri&s;t, we have read the Relation in the Go&s;pel of his Conception, Birth, Life and Death, Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion: Now where this Belief doth give a Man this Kind of Chri&s;tian Knowledge, that doth open a Door and Way for him into the Pre&s;ence of God: This is a Que&s;tion that ought &s;eriou&s;ly to be con&s;idered, for if we err in this Que&s;tion, we err in all; this is like &s;tum|bling at the Thre&s;hold, and never come into the Hou&s;e. If we mi&s;take in laying hold of Chri&s;t, we mi&s;take in our Wor&s;hip, and in all Matters that relate to Life and Salvation.</P>
<P>For if we mu&s;t have another Sort of Knowledge of Chri&s;t, than we can have from the Reports of others; if I mu&s;t have Chri&s;t revealed in me before I can have the Hope of Glory; if I mu&s;t have the Spirit of Chri&s;t in me, to help me to put up my Reque&s;ts and Supplications before he can pre&s;ent them to the Fa|ther, then all literal Knowledge and Faith cannot &s;tand Men in any Stead, but this is evident by the Te&s;timony of all the Writers of the New Te&s;ta|ment. Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles did concurrently &s;ig|nify, that the Hope of a Chri&s;tian, that the Power and Strength of a Chri&s;tian, it all lies in this, In that they had known the Revelation of Chri&s;t, and the powerful Operation of the Spirit working in them; this was that which was well plea&s;ing to God; many Scriptures might be &s;poken of, but you know the Scriptures, and can read them, and &s;ee in them the concurrent Te&s;timony of all Holy Men to this Day, that the Knowledge they had of Chri&s;t was a divine Knowledge, a &s;piritual Knowledge, it was knowing him after the Spirit, it was a Revela|tion
<PB N="7" REF="010868_0007_0F851A8FA57B8908">
of Chri&s;t in them, that &s;eparated and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them from Reprobates, even the Knowledge of God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t their Lord: Why &s;hould not we come to this Knowledge as well as they? The Lord is the &s;ame, and his Power is the &s;ame and his <HI>Arm is not &s;hortened:</HI> We may &s;ee as much Need of divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and divine Love as ever Men did; we can perform no Duty, either of Prayer or Preaching, without divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance; not &s;o much as a Sigh or Groan, that may have Acceptance with God, without the Help of his Spirit, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 26 <HI>The Spirit helpeth our Infirmities, for we know not what we &s;hould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it&s;elf maketh Interce&s;&s;ion for us with Groanings which cannot be uttered.</HI> If we go about the Duty of Prayer without divine A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, we &s;ee what &s;ad Work we make of it; if we pray not in the Spirit and with the Under&s;tanding, how can we receive the Thing we pray for? But if we <HI>Pray in the Spirit, and with the under&s;tanding al&s;o,</HI> then the <HI>Spirit helps our Infirmities;</HI> the Spirit that came from God brings us the Things we &s;tand in Need of.</P>
<P>So that a Chri&s;tian hath a Foundation for his Wor|&s;hip and Chri&s;tian Performance; what is that Founda|tion? Nothing that is corrupt, if it be, it is good for nothing; for nothing that is corrupted and that de|files, can be acceptable and plea&s;ing to God; we are all polluted and defiled by Nature; how can carnal Men wor&s;hip a Spiritual God? Carnal Men that are in Death and Darkne&s;s, cannot wor&s;hip that God that is Light, and dwells in Light, that is inacce&s;|&s;ible, that is <HI>of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity.</HI> Carnal Men want a Foundation for their Wor&s;hip, and will do till they come to that Foundation that God hath laid.</P>
<P>Now, that I may &s;peak intelligibly what the Lord hath laid upon my Heart, I would &s;ay thus; There
<PB N="8" REF="010868_0008_0F851A91C5FB5388">
is an univer&s;al Benefit and Privilege di&s;tributed and given freely of God, unto the Sons and Daughters of Men, in their natural State, through his Son, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in that he hath cau&s;ed his Light to &s;hine, and his Grace to be extended to every Man; <HI>for the Grace of God</HI> which bringeth Salvation (for it is not by Works) <HI>hath appeared unto all Men,</HI> and bring|eth Light, by which every Man may &s;ee how to wor&s;hip God; God hath enlightened every Man, and this Light comes by Chri&s;t the Mediator; this Mediator is the Way that Men mu&s;t walk in, if they will come back again to God; for Men are run out and departed from God; if Men will draw near to God, and take &s;ome Foot&s;teps towards the Kingdom of God, from the Kingdom of Sin and Satan, they mu&s;t mind the Way, the Way mu&s;t be their Director, they mu&s;t not go which Way they li&s;t.</P>
<P>This is that which was prophe&s;ied of Chri&s;t, &s;aith God by the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah, I will give him for a Leader.</HI> I would fain return to God, and go out of the Kingdom of Sin and Satan, to the Kingdom of God: God hath given Chri&s;t to lead me, if I knew that Way he will lead me in, I would go that Way. As &s;oon as a Man takes hold of Chri&s;t, his Grace, and Spirit, and Life, he will be ready to &s;ay, I am corrupt, my Sen&s;es are corrupt, my Mind is depraved, my Con&s;cience defiled and polluted; but I have found out &s;omething that God hath be|&s;towed upon me, that is E&s;&s;ential, Holy and Pure, that did never con&s;ent to my Corruption, but is a Witne&s;s for God again&s;t it: Here now a Chri&s;tian lays hold on Chri&s;t, the Leader; which Way will he lead me? If thou laye&s;t hold of this Guide, he will lead thee out of Evil, he will teach thee to cea&s;e to do Evil, and &s;peak Evil: This Light will lead thee to nothing that will di&s;honour God, or defile
<PB N="9" REF="010868_0009_0F851A85530DE630">
thy own Soul: But this is not all, we mu&s;t not on|ly cea&s;e to do Evil, but we mu&s;t be doing &s;ome|thing; there mu&s;t be a breaking off from Pride, <HI>Fooli&s;h Je&s;ting, Evil Communication;</HI> but this is not all that he will lead me to; let us learn that Le&s;&s;on, <HI>Cea&s;e to do Evil.</HI> This Doctrine was preached before Chri&s;tianity was preached, as it is now preached; the Prophets of old preached this Doctrine to the <HI>Jews</HI> that were under an outward Admini&s;tration, <HI>Cea&s;e to do Evil, and learn to do well,</HI> then I will plead with you, and di&s;cour&s;e with you, &s;aith the Lord: <HI>Come now let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord, though your Sins be as Scarlet, they &s;hall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crim&s;om, they &s;hall be as Wool.</HI></P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on that a true Chri&s;tian learns in his turning to God, in his Change and Tran&s;la|tion, <HI>to cea&s;e from that which is Evil:</HI> Here is a Ce&s;|&s;ation of Rebellion, and here is &s;ome hopes of being reconciled to God; a Man hath been a Rebel again&s;t his Maker, but he hath now received help to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e Temptations that prevail over him; But there is no wor&s;hiping yet, there is a forward mind in Men to do &s;omething that is plea&s;ing to God; but there are &s;ome that are not troubled at all for their Evil Ways, and dread not God's Anger, but make a mock at Sin, that draws others to it, and make them&s;elves merry in it: But there is a Sort &s;o far touched with a di|vine Sen&s;e of God's Love to them, that they have al&s;o a Sen&s;e of his Anger and Indignation, becau&s;e of their Sin; and they would fain be out of his Anger; and who can blame them? When a Man feels the Anger of God burning like a Fire in his Bo&s;om, who can blame that Man if he de&s;ire Peace with God? If he be under a Sen&s;e of the Di&s;plea&s;ure and Indignation of the Almighty, he mu&s;t not ha&s;te too &s;oon out of that Condition he is brought into; for this is God's Purpo&s;e, and this is the Fruit of all
<PB N="10" REF="010868_0010_0F851A92986B24F8">
his Troubles and Afflictions, to take away Sin: God had no other End or De&s;ign in the Affliction that came upon him, than to take away Sin; when God hath brought a People into a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and de|jected State for their Sin, the Fruit that God expects, is the <HI>taking away of their Sin,</HI> and he will hide Pride from them, and humble them before him; if this be the Purpo&s;e of God that he intends to purge and purify his People; then &s;aith the poor Creature, if God de&s;ign to purify me from Sin, then I will pray to God to &s;upport me, and bear me up under his Indignation: That is the Cry of the Soul that he may not be brought too &s;oon from under the Judgment of God, but he may be &s;upported and hid in the Hollow of God's Hand, until the Time of Remi&s;&s;ion and Refre&s;hing comes, that he may behold the Light of God's Countenance.</P>
<P>Here is Encouragement for every one that is ac|quainted with this divine Principle of Grace, that will be led by it, and follow it &s;o far as to be led out of Evil; then they will be &s;itted to do &s;omething in the Work of God; every Sigh and Groan that thou ha&s;t, the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of God to help thee in, is Part of Wor&s;hip: All thy Brokenne&s;s of Heart is part of Wor&s;hip; hereby thou acknowledge&s;t the great God, that he is able to help thee on in thy Way, and to pardon thy Iniquity, and blot out thy Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and give thee all tho&s;e heavenly Ble&s;&s;ings that thy Soul doth &s;tand in Need of: Then thy Soul will bow down to God in Acts of holy Wor&s;hip, and &s;ay, with an humble Confidence and Expectation, God will do all tho&s;e things in me, and for me, that will promote my Salvation. It is nothing in Religion for People to go from Praying and Preaching to Sinning; but God mu&s;t have a holy Sacrifice, and that mu&s;t come out of a pure Heart:
<PB N="11" REF="010868_0011_0F851A92B1A76D00">
Now when a Man is brought by the Help of God, and by the divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Mediator, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to break off from his Sin, then he &s;tands fair to become a Child of God, and to be a Servant of God, and to do &s;omething for God in his Gene|ration, and to offer to God Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving, and to perform all other Duties that God &s;hall lead him into.</P>
<P>But &s;ome will &s;ay, What, mu&s;t we do any thing? I have deeply weighed that Que&s;tion, what a poor Man or Woman mu&s;t do, that is come out of Bon|dage? There is a Propen&s;ity in People to be doing, they would fain do &s;omething, they would be doing; they &s;ay, What &s;hall I do? If I do &s;omething that plea&s;es not God, I had better let it alone; and I can do nothing acceptable to God without divine A&s;|&s;i&s;tance: Such an one that &s;ees his own Impotency and Inability, will ca&s;t his Care upon God, and will &s;ay, The Lord is able to lead me and guide me: I am ready to do thy Will, O God: Make it clear to me that this is thy Will, and that this is that which thou require&s;t, I am ready to do it, tho' it be cro&s;s to mine own Will: He is ready to go on in God's Way, in the Way of Chri&s;tianity; &s;uch an one that hath the true Knowledge of Chri&s;t, if he &s;peaks, the Spirit of Chri&s;t &s;peaks in him; if he prays, it is through the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, through whom God alone is appea&s;ed and reconciled, and through whom they may receive a Ble&s;&s;ing from God's Hands: But for Men to run on in their own Wills, and to do a thing becau&s;e they Will do it, they had better &s;it &s;till; this doing in their own Wills, hath filled the World with a Sort of Chri&s;tians that want Acceptance with God, which is to be had alone through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and the Want of the Guidance of God's Holy Spi|rit, is the Mi&s;ery and Downfal of Chri&s;tianity in our Days.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="010868_0012_0F851A93933B5AE8">
Therefore it is our Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s to build upon that Foundation which God hath laid; no Wor&s;hip is plea&s;ing to God, but that which ari&s;eth from that Spring that is pure and Holy: If I cannot find that which will keep me from all pollution and defilement, if I cannot find that, I mu&s;t &s;tay till I can; for to begin a Wor&s;hip and a Religion without that which I know is acceptable to God, it is but lo&s;t Labour, and Time &s;pent in vain.</P>
<P>Therefore, Friends, let every one that de&s;ires to be religious, turn their Mind inward, wait for the Gift of God, which is e&s;&s;entially pure, that never did con&s;ent to Evil, that never mixed with the Cor|ruption of Nature, but bears witne&s;s to the Light, that will guide you and lead you, and conduct you, fir&s;t out of Sin, and then it will lead you into that Wor&s;hip and Religion, and the Performance of tho&s;e Things that are plea&s;ing to God, They that are come to this Wor&s;hip, they do not only know what the Lord requires of them, and when he requires it of them, but they are given up into the Hands of God; they pray, preach, exhort and live according to the Will of God.</P>
<P>It is hard for People in a carnal State to believe this; but you that are Believers, that are come to know the Gift of God in your&s;elves, and the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of being ruled by him; you will believe us, for none el&s;e will believe us; let us preach to as ma|ny People and Nations as we will, none will receive us as true Mini&s;ters, but tho&s;e that have the Truth in their own Hearts; if there be any that de&s;pi&s;eth the Grace of God in his own Heart, he hates that which chides and reproves him; if there be &s;uch a Man, he will hate me becau&s;e I am a Mini&s;ter and a Witne&s;s of the Grace of God, and of that Truth in the inward Parts, which is the Ground and Foundation that Man hath of Acceptance with God.
<PB N="13" REF="010868_0013_0F851A981915AD38">
A wicked carnal Wretch will &s;ay, I hate &s;uch an one, I hate the Light, that which checks me, and witne&s;&s;eth again&s;t me; thou art &s;uch an one as beare&s;t witne&s;s again&s;t me, therefore I hate thee: It is very true, it cannot be otherwi&s;e: Now our de&s;ire and Labour is, that Men may come to the Love of the Truth in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>You know there are a great many other Mini|&s;ters, who&s;e Labours are to per&s;wade People to be|lieve what they &s;ay; to lay down a Doctrine, and prove it by Scripture and Rea&s;on, and &s;et it home upon their Minds by &s;uch Te&s;timony as the Scrip|ture affords, and hereupon they prevail upon the Minds and Judgments of People, to believe what they lay down.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to lay down a Po&s;ition, and prove it, and convince People that it mu&s;t be according to Scripture; but when a Per&s;on is convinced of a Principle of Truth, he is not Regenerate thereby, and come to God; therefore, though he cannot de|ny the Doctrine of Truth in Words, yet he can deny it in Works, and doth not rightly come to love it. If People would believe what we &s;ay, and ob|&s;erve what Argument we bring for proving a Po&s;i|tion, they may be convinced of the Doctrine of Truth, and come to a Profe&s;&s;ion of it, and yet be Strangers to it, till they come to love it in them|&s;elves; if it were not for this, we would leave Preaching, if God had not given a Mea&s;ure and Manife&s;tation of the Spirit to every Man to profit withal: You have it in your&s;elves, we are but as Monitors to you, to put you in Mind of it; you have &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s in the World, that you have not had lei&s;ure to take Notice of it.</P>
<P>A Man may have a rich Jewel, and be poor not|with&s;tanding, till he comes to know the Value of it. A Man hath a rich and precious Jewel, a Pearl
<PB N="14" REF="010868_0014_0F851A992364AB40">
be&s;towed upon him that would make him rich in Faith and Love to God, and qualify him for the Kingdom of God, and make him an Heir of it, but he knows not, nor under&s;tands the Value of it, and e&s;teems it not; therefore God hath rai&s;ed up Mini|&s;ters to put you in mind of it, that you may be hap|py forever, and live in Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s to all Eternity; <HI>Whoever hath an Ear to hear, let him hear;</HI> and when they hear what we &s;ay, let them take the Benefit of it to their own Souls. We bring not Truth to you, but God hath be&s;towed it upon you; you will be rich indeed, if you do as a Man that bought a Field where the precious Pearl was, and digged till he found it. Come to the Foundation upon which you &s;hould build all your Hopes of Happine&s;s, and de|pend not upon your own Works, or religious Per|formances, for Acceptance with God; for there is no Acceptance with God, but only through Chri&s;t, we are only accepted of God through him: Tho&s;e that will become Chri&s;tians indeed, and wor&s;hip God as he hath ordained and appointed him&s;elf to be wor&s;hipped; they mu&s;t come to the Principle of Light and Grace in their own Hearts, which they have in, and through Chri&s;t, and they will find Acceptance with God.</P>

<P>YOU have read and heard much concerning the Day of the Lord, as a great and notable Day; many of you are now living Witne&s;&s;es that the great and notable Day of the Lord is coming, in
<PB N="15" REF="010868_0015_0F851A9997908050">
which the Accompli&s;hment of great and notable Things, the mighty Works of God, which have been prophe&s;ied of, may be lawfully expected. It is the Work of every Chri&s;tian to wait upon the Lord in the Light of this Day, and to be acquainted with the Works of the Lord, both inwardly and out|wardly; for the Day of the Lord is a Day of Power, and that Power of God worketh wonderful Things; and if we were not kept in the Light of that Day, the Lord may work great things, and we not know it; we &s;hall be looked upon as carele&s;s and negligent Witne&s;&s;es of the Works of the Lord, as tho&s;e that do not regard them. If you would be faithful Witne&s;&s;es, you mu&s;t have regard to the Works of the Lord, and the Operation of his Hands. One that is minded to be a faithful Witne&s;s, he will take Notice of what is &s;aid and done; you are cal|led to be Witne&s;&s;es of the Works of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of his doings; you mu&s;t &s;tand where you may hear, and &s;ee, and under&s;tand what the Lord is about to do at this Time.</P>
<P>In your Te&s;timony and Witne&s;s bearing, the greate&s;t Thing we have to expect in this Day of the Lord is, that God will &s;et up the Kingdom of his Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and unto this all the Prophets did bear witne&s;s in their Time, and now it is our Turn to bear witne&s;s of it by &s;en&s;ible and living Experiences of the Accompli&s;hment of tho&s;e Things that they prophe&s;ied of, that the Lord will &s;et up the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, and bring down and lay wa&s;te the Kingdom of Antichri&s;t. This our Saviour taught his Di&s;ciples to pray for, &s;ixteen hundred Years ago, that the Kingdom of God might come; and all the true Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t ever &s;ince have prayed for the coming of this Kingdom, and many of them have &s;een the coming of it, and rejoiced;
<PB N="16" REF="010868_0016_0F851A9A2C9237A0">
and others have died in the Faith of it, and have been gathered into the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>But, my Friends, that which chiefly concerns us at this Day, is to behold the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, the eternal Son of God, within us, to go forward and pro&s;per; and the Kingdom of Antichri&s;t &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and de&s;troyed, and utterly laid wa&s;te; and this is wrought two Ways, 1. Inwardly. 2. Outwardly.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Inwardly, There is a greater Inclination in the Minds of People, to look more at the Operation of God's Power in this great Work outwardly, than to look at it inwardly, but unto that there mu&s;t be a daily Cro&s;s taken up, and it is my Bu&s;ine&s;s at this Time to tell you in the Name of the Lord, that your Duty and mine is to turn our Minds to the Working of the Power of God in our&s;elves, and to &s;ee that other Kingdom of the Man of Sin weakned and brought down within us; then there is no Fear but he will carry on his Work outwardly, and we &s;hall &s;ee as much of that Work as belongs to our Generation; but the great Matter and chief Con|cernment of you and me, is to &s;ee the Kingdom of God &s;et up within us, which &s;tands in Holine&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s: Our Bu&s;ine&s;s is to walk till we &s;ee the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of this Kingdom &s;et up within us in our Hearts and Souls, and to have a real change made.</P>
<P>We all know, and we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that we have been &s;ubject to the Man of Sin, what&s;oever we are now. We have &s;een the Reign and Government, the Rage and Tyranny of the Wicked One that hath led us into Rebellion and Di&s;obedience to the Lord our Maker; how do we like that Government to be ruled by the Devil, and to be led Captive, and to be made to do his Will, and to rebel again&s;t God that gave us our Life, and our Breath, and
<PB N="17" REF="010868_0017_0F851A9B008EE220">
our Being? How do we like that Government of Satan? I hope we do none of us like it. It was &s;o with me, and they that are under the tyrannical Go|vernment of Satan, have many Cries and Wi&s;hes in their Souls that they were freed and delivered from it, and brought under the Government and Obedi|ence of Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and they were able to &s;erve God as they ought to do, that they might be tran&s;|lated from the Kingdom of Sin and Satan, into the Kingdom of the ble&s;&s;ed and dearly beloved Son of God.</P>
<P>This hath been the Cry of &s;ome ever &s;ince they have known the World; and I am per&s;waded it is the Cry of many at this Day: I have good News to bring you; not that the Day of your Redemption draws nigh, but that it is come; the Day of Re|demption is now come, and there are a great many ble&s;&s;|ing and glorifying the Name of God that they are redeemed, and delivered from the Bondage of Cor|ruption, and have more Joy and Delight in the Ser|vice of God, that made them, than ever they had in the Service of the God of this World.</P>
<P>But may not &s;ome &s;ay, How &s;hall this great Work be wrought; for it is a great Work, and we verily think that nothing but an Almighty Power can effect it? For there are many in this A&s;&s;embly have been try|ing to no Purpo&s;e, and done what they could in their own Strength, to deliver their own Souls from Death, and yet they find them&s;elves in Bondage &s;till; nay, they have called in the Help and A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of tho&s;e that they thought to be &s;tronger than them&s;elves, and all have &s;ailed, and they are yet weak and entangled, and they cannot find them&s;elves at Liberty to &s;erve the Lord as they ought to do.</P>
<P>I am of this Mind, that nothing but the Almighty Power of God can do it; and when you come to my Experience, to know this as I have done, then
<PB N="18" REF="010868_0018_0F851A9C12514520">
I hope you will &s;eek after that, and you will &s;ee good Rea&s;on for it; and you will then come to this Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, If the Lord puts not forth his Almighty Power, I mu&s;t then peri&s;h, for there is no other Power can deliver me: When you come to know this, what mu&s;t you do? Why, you mu&s;t wait for the Revelation of that Power that will take you off from all Tru&s;t and Confidence that you have ever had in any Thing el&s;e; a Man that hath nothing to tru&s;t to but the Almighty Power, and Mercy, and Good|ne&s;s of God, he puts his whole Tru&s;t and Confi|dence therein, or el&s;e he knows he mu&s;t peri&s;h.</P>
<P>When a Man or Woman comes to this pa&s;s, that they have nothing to rely upon but the Lord, then they will meet together to wait upon the Lord: And this was the fir&s;t Ground or Motive of our &s;etting up Meetings; and I would to God that this was the u&s;e that every one would make of them that come to them, then they would be ju&s;tly and properly u&s;ed according to the End of the In&s;titution of them at fir&s;t; we &s;hould u&s;e them as poor de&s;olate help|le&s;s People that are broken off from all their own Confidence and Tru&s;t, and have nothing to rely upon but the Mercy and Goodne&s;s of God; and if he plea&s;eth to reveal his Power among us, we know that he is able to &s;ave us; and we have met with the Revelation of God's Power; and when we have met together in Simplicity of Mind, the Lord was plea&s;ed to communicate his Spirit to us, and open a Door for us, and di&s;cover and reveal to us that it was the Day of his Power: And when we came to examine our&s;elves whether we were willing in this Day of God's Power (for the Prophet gives us a Note of Di&s;tinction between the People of God, and other People; <HI>Thy People &s;hall be willing in the Day of thy Power,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, God di&s;covers and reveals his Power to them, &s;uch a
<PB N="19" REF="010868_0019_0F851A9C854D7BA0">
People are willing to give them&s;elves over to the Government of it, when we found we were &s;ubject to it) we had Joy in believing, before we attained the End of our Hope; it was Gladne&s;s to us we found our&s;elves willing; and I am per&s;waded that every one of you would be glad to find your&s;elves willing to part with that which you cry out of.</P>
<P>What a Cry is there of our Bondage and Corrup|tion, and of our being led Captive by our Lu&s;ts? We may hear &s;uch a Cry from one End of the Kingdom to the other: People cry out of the Bon|dage of Corruption, and of their Subjection to Sin and Satan: I would they were in earne&s;t; there is not that Earne&s;tne&s;s and Reality in Men and Wo|men that God looks for, and &s;o there comes no|thing of it. There is no Redemption, and no De|liverance, the Lord doth not hear them, though they come now a-days into his Pre&s;ence, to offer up their Prayers: I would have you to be in good ear|ne&s;t, I wi&s;h well to you all; and it would be hard to &s;ay that you do not wi&s;h well to your&s;elves: Here lies your Welfare, that you find your&s;elves willing to be &s;ubject to the Power that made you; you have been &s;ubject doubtle&s;s to the Power that de&s;troyed you; that Power that never gave you Life and Breath, hath been in&s;trumental of your De&s;truction: The Power of the God of this World never did Men good, but de&s;troyed them, deceived them, and deprived them of their Lives.</P>
<P>Now if their was but a Willingne&s;s in every one of us, freely to give up our &s;elves to that Power that created us to obey his Will: I am &s;ure there is never a Man or Woman among us &s;hall long be without the knowledge of it&punc; If I am but willing to be &s;ubject to the Law of him that made me, it will not be long before he di&s;cover it to me, and reveal his Power in me in the Glory and Excellency of it; that Power
<PB N="20" REF="010868_0020_0F851A9D31D3F758">
which is more able to pre&s;erve me than all the Pow|er of Men on Earth, or all the Power of the Devils in Hell is able to de&s;troy me. When the Lord &s;hall di&s;cover and reveal his Power in you, you will be willing to be &s;ubject to it.</P>
<P>But methinks the Sound and Noi&s;e of Fle&s;h and Blood grows loud here: I would be &s;ubject to God, but I would not have him cro&s;s mine Intere&s;t, and deprive me of that I love and thir&s;t after; I would not have him imbitter my carnal Delights and Plea&s;ures, and undo me as to my Reputation in the World.</P>
<P>You may &s;ee whence this comes, that you would make a Bargain, and draw a Contract with the God of your Lives about the&s;e Things, this is a non&s;en|&s;ical Thing; becau&s;e of all People in the World, you are a People that have had a Veneration for the Holy Scriptures, the Scriptures of Truth, and have been acquainted with them &s;o familiarly as with any Book in the World, wherein you find Articles drawn, long ago fixed and &s;ealed; and no new ones are to be drawn. If any one will be my Di&s;ciple, <HI>John,</HI> or <HI>Thomas, James</HI> or <HI>Peter,</HI> or who&s;oever he be, he mu&s;t take up his Daily-Cro&s;s, and deny him&s;elf, and follow me. Now here is a Contract made, therefore turn a&s;ide from all Kind of Rea&s;oning and Con&s;ulting with Fle&s;h and Blood.</P>
<P>If you will become &s;piritual, and partake of &s;pi|ritual Ble&s;&s;ings and Benefits, I would advi&s;e you to turn from all Kind of Rea&s;onings that come from the Pit of Darkne&s;s, that hath thus far deceived you, and will ruin you for ever, if you hearken to them: For a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves new Go&s;pel-Terms no Man can make; and if any come to preach new Go&s;pel-Terms, count him a Deceiver; for there is no po&s;&s;ibility of being a Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, but by taking up a Cro&s;s daily, and denying our&s;elves, and following him as our Leader and Guide. To him
<PB N="21" REF="010868_0021_0F851A9E8B73ABD0">
I mu&s;t go, and go in no other Way, &s;peaking no|thing, or doing nothing but what is holy and pure; he mu&s;t conduct me in my Walking, guide me in my Way, and ju&s;tify me in it: This is to be a true Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he comes to adhere, and join to the Power of God revealed in his Soul, he &s;ees the coming of the Kingdom of God, he &s;ees it at a Di&s;|tance, he &s;aith within him&s;elf, and makes this Con|clu&s;ion, I will follow my Captain, I will become &s;ubject to the Kingdom of Chri&s;t. If I obey this divine Principle of the Grace of God, and the Go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t, I &s;hall be his Di&s;ciple. I read in his ble&s;&s;ed Book, <HI>That as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Children of God.</HI> I am not to propo&s;e new Terms, but accept of the old Terms of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t: I &s;ee that the Kingdom of God is to be &s;et up, and the Kingdom of the Devil to be brought down in me; if I follow this divine Princi|ple, I &s;hould never follow the Devil more; if he would have me lye, I &s;hall refu&s;e, and &s;ay I can|not; if he would have me run into vain and corrupt Communication, and fooli&s;h Je&s;ting, that will be a Bridle to me, that I cannot do it.</P>
<P>I &s;peak now to Per&s;ons that live under the Light of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and that are &s;ubdued by his Grace; I would &s;peak that which all the Logick in the World cannot overthrow, that which the mo&s;t cunning Logician, with all his Wit and Quirks, cannot refute and prove erronious. If a Man be led by the Spirit of God, he cannot Lie; this is a com|mon Cure for all Men; if I be led by the Spirit of Truth, and hearken to the Principle of Truth in my own Soul; this will cure and heal me of the Wounds and Maladies of my corrupt Nature, and &s;et me at Liberty from my old Ma&s;ter; I do not like his Service.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="010868_0022_0F851A9F33997518">
I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> any of you like the Servitude and Bon|dage of Sin and Satan, you will de&s;ire Liberty before you die: Why do not you de&s;ire it now? It may be thou thinke&s;t to enjoy a little Liberty and Reputati|on, and Plea&s;ure in Sin for many Years, for Six or Seven, Nine or Ten Years, and then break off from it, and repent and turn to God: How do&s;t thou know that thou ha&s;t Ten Days to live? It is of high Concernment to every one of us to wait for a Di&s;co|very of Go&s;pel-Liberty, and an Ability and Power in his Soul, to enable him to break off from the Servitude and Bondage of Sin and Satan, that he hath &s;o long lived under; and to wait upon God with Patience, for the &s;etting his Soul at Liber|ty, and &s;etting up the Kingdom of Chri&s;t within him, and pulling down the Kingdom of Satan, that he may be brought into the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, that con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>Peace and Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> The&s;e are the Things that follow one ano|ther; when Righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;et up in me, I &s;hall not be di&s;turbed, I &s;hall have Peace; and if I have Peace I &s;hall have Joy, and this Joy is in the Holy Gho&s;t the Apo&s;tle &s;aith the Kingdom of God con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>Now that every one might be per&s;waded that God hath given a Mea&s;ure of his Grace to them, as well as to other Folks: Let them con&s;ider and &s;ay within them&s;elves, God hath not &s;hut me out of the Num|ber of his People: He hath knocked at the Door of my Heart, to bring me to Repentance, he hath waited upon me &s;o long, &s;urely he hath a Mind to &s;ave me: Would he call upon me, but that he intends I &s;hould repent and turn to him?</P>
<P>But where is the Power? You will &s;ay knocking at the Door of the Heart, and Checks of Con&s;ci|ence, we under&s;tand them; but we unde&s;tand not where the Power is, to be conformable to the Will of God.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="010868_0023_0F851A9FC4D4A608">
People will never under&s;tand it while they are in the Kingdom of Satan, and under the Power of the Prince of Darkne&s;s; the Apo&s;tle tells us, <HI>That the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them that believe not le&s;t the Light of the glorious Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who is the Image of God, &s;hould &s;hine upon them.</HI> If Men &s;aw the Beauty of the Go&s;pel, they would run after it, and embrace it; therefore the Devil blinds their Minds, that they &s;hould not &s;ee the Beauty and Amiablene&s;s of the Go&s;pel, and like the Terms of it: He hath the Rule and Government of the Chil|dren of Di&s;obedience. So long as I live in Sub|jection to that devili&s;h helli&s;h Power, which leads me forth into Sin: I &s;hall be a Stranger to God's Power, that would enable me to break off from it.</P>
<P>You never read in Scripture of any that ever came to be &s;aved by the Power of God, but there was Faith mixed with it, that came to join with that Power of God. Our Saviour &s;aid to the impotent Man, <HI>Thy Faith hath made thee whole;</HI> thy Faith join|ing with that Power of God. <HI>We &s;hall be made &s;trong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might,</HI> and be able to with&s;tand Temptations.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Soul of Man joins with the Grace of God, he doth for&s;ake the Service of his old Ma|&s;ter and Governor, Sin &s;hall no longer have Domi|nion over him; though he may meet with the &s;ame Temptation, it &s;hall not have the &s;ame Power over him, but he will be enabled, by the Grace of God to with&s;tand it, and overcome it. If you a&s;k &s;uch a Man how it is that he overcomes that Tempta|tion that formerly prevailed over him; he will tell you, I have now an Helper, I am now joined to the Grace of God in my Soul, therefore do I with|&s;tand Temptations, and have Power over them. Thus comes the Kingdom of Chri&s;t to be &s;et up in the Soul, and this is that which will fit and prepare
<PB N="24" REF="010868_0024_0F851AA0E6CDD680">
us for the everla&s;ting Kingdom of God: They that do wait upon God, &s;hall &s;ee this Work wrought inwardly in them, they know more by Faith than they can &s;ee by Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>I know and am certain, that the Power the Devil hath in the World, &s;hall be broken down, and Righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;hall be exalted, and Ju&s;tice and Equity &s;hall prevail in the Nations. I &s;hall not perhaps live to &s;ee it, but I may &s;ee it by Faith; I have &s;een enough for my Generation, and they that live in the next Generation &s;hall &s;ee it al&s;o, for the Church of God is the &s;ame from one Generation to another. Now unto us it is given to &s;ee the Things that in former Generations were prophe&s;ied of, God having (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>provided &s;ome better Thing for us, that they without us &s;hall not be made perfect.</HI></P>
<P>The Church of God from one Generation to ano|ther, have their Mea&s;ure and Degree of Service, and bear their proper Te&s;timony, and leave the Re&s;t to &s;ucceeding Generations: It concerns us in our Ge|neration to &s;ee a Change made inwardly in our Souls, and the Kingdom of Chri&s;t &s;et up within us, and the Kingdom of Satan brought down in our&s;elves. This doth not concern my Son or Grand&s;on only, but it concerns me, and when they grow up to mature Age, in their Time it will concern them: There|fore that which is mo&s;t profitable to us, is, that we have &s;uch a Station, and &s;tand in &s;uch a Place in our Time, where we may &s;ee the Work of God carried on.</P>
<P>I have con&s;idered many a Time, that there are many brave Men and Women in this Age, that might have been eminent Witne&s;&s;es of God in this World, and born their Te&s;timony to his Truth, but their Faith hath been weak and ineffectual: They have di&s;covered their unbelieving Hearts, and have joined with the common Herd of the World, becau&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="010868_0025_0F851AA223C03CA8">
they thought &s;uch great Things could never be done, that the Kingdom of Satan could never be pulled down and de&s;troyed, and the Kingdom of Chri&s;t &s;et up within us. But I would hope better Things of you, Things that accompany Salvation and that he that hath begun a good Work in you will carry it on to Perfection; that living Prai&s;es and joyful Thank&s;|givings may be rendered to him who alone is worthy, who is God over all, ble&s;&s;ed for ever; to whom be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>My Friends, this comes near to many of your States; many of you have heard long, and have heard the &s;peak|able Word of God, that which could be uttered, that which could be &s;poken forth, by the Demon&s;tration of the Holy Gho&s;t, by them <HI>that have received it of the Father;</HI> this you have heard long, and yet there are many of you, that if you come to a &s;erious Search,

I do not wonder that they who profe&s;s they cannot live a Day with|out Sin, that they &s;hould fall; but they that profe&s;s to believe there is Power enough in Chri&s;t, and that it is offered to them; for them to live in Sin and yield to Temptation, this is horrid Wickedne&s;s.

<P><HI>The Love of Chri&s;t con&s;trains Men thus to judge, that every one that hath received like precious Faith,</HI> ought to an&s;wer that Grace and Faith which God hath mini&s;tred to them in an holy Life and Con|ver&s;ation, and every one who is a &s;tranger to this Thing, ought to be of an enquiring Mind and an open Heart to wait for the Day when God will vi&s;it them with the &s;ame Grace; when you give up your|&s;elves to a daily Cro&s;s, as Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples, you will not be running after any one to teach you to know the Lord, for you will all <HI>know the Lord, from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t;</HI> I that have been but a little convinc'd, &s;hall I know the Lord?

<P>I remember a notable Saying of the Apo&s;tle, which hath a great Empha&s;is in it, and a great Deal of Doctrine, he writeth to the Church after they were become a People of Pro&s;e&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, <HI>Take heed le&s;t you come to be beguiled by the Serpent, as he be|guiled Eve;</HI> he did not &s;peak of <HI>Jezabel,</HI> a wicked Woman; but he &s;poke of <HI>Eve,</HI> a good Woman <HI>cre|ated after the Image of God, in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Ho|line&s;s:</HI> They were come to a Life of Sanctification, to a Life <HI>that was hidden from Ages and Generations;</HI> You mu&s;t look to your&s;elves, and look upon your|&s;elves as in the State of your Mother <HI>Eve,</HI> a Woman brought forth in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s, that might have &s;tood in that Primitive State, notwith&s;tanding all the Subtility of all the Serpents in the World; but letting her Ear hearken to this Old Serpent, &s;he was beguiled; there grew up a Con|&s;ultation in her rea&s;oning Part; it may be &s;o as he &s;aith, I will try.</P>
<P>So I &s;ay to you that are come to a State of Sanc|tification, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure to know the clean&s;ing Power of God, and that you have not believed in it in vain, but it hath effectually wrought &s;ome Change and Alteration in you, and is &s;till carrying on the Work of your Salvation: Many Temptations will attend you, and many Snares will be laid in your Way, but God hath pre&s;erved you to this Day: I know the Devil's Wiles and Temptations are ma|nifold; they are fitted to every one's Inclinations, fitted to every Opportunity, and to every Occa&s;ion in this World; Men are tryed every Way by the Tempter, to &s;ee which Way he may en&s;nare them; he tries every Way to <HI>en&s;nare</HI> and entangle <HI>the &s;imple,</HI> that he may turn them to the right Hand or to the left, that their Souls may be de&s;troyed and peri&s;h.</P>

I cannot &s;peak to you by a more emphatical Word, by a more familiar Exhortation than this, <HI>Take heed you be not beguiled as Eve was:</HI> many will be tempted as &s;he was; but I would not have you do as &s;he did, and yield to the Temptation: Take heed that you do not defile your&s;elves, but <HI>keep your Gar|ments white;</HI> you that have been wa&s;hed and clean&s;|ed, labour to <HI>keep your&s;elves un&s;potted from the World; this is pure Religion and undefiled,</HI> that which hath enlightened many a Nation, and &s;hall enlighten many of tho&s;e who&s;e Religion is to be undefiled, and to <HI>keep them&s;elves un&s;potted from the World:</HI> I pray God increa&s;e the Number of them, that &s;o the ble&s;&s;ed Work of Sanctification, that hath begun in this Way, may be carried on to his Prai&s;e, and the Salvation of our Souls, to the &s;preading forth of his Glory, and the exalting of his Name; that the Strangers which are &s;cattered and de&s;olate, may be brought into his holy Way, and walk in it; that we all, in a Fellow&s;hip together, walking in that holy Way, may through the Eternal Spirit, offer Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving to God, who is worthy to recieve Glory and Honour, Power and Dominion, for ever and even. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>Except ye be regenerated and born again, ye cannot in|herit the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the Word of the Lord God to all People this Day; this lies not in <HI>airy Profe&s;|&s;ion,</HI> and in vain Imaginations, and what&s;oever el&s;e it is that you deck your&s;elves withal; you mu&s;t every particular Man and Woman be <HI>born again,</HI> el&s;e you cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. This was the Doctrine of Chri&s;t in that prepared Body wherein he appeared in the World, and preached to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> that <HI>&s;tanding Doctrine</HI> to this Moment of Time, and <HI>will be &s;o</HI> while any Man breathes upon the Earth; there is <HI>no other Way,</HI> no other Gate to enter into Life, but by this great Work of <HI>Regene|ration.</HI> Now to enforce People to come to this great Work, and to &s;et forward from Earth to Hea|ven, all being <HI>driven out of Paradi&s;e,</HI> by the Cheru|bim &s;et with a flaming Sword, there is no <HI>returning</HI> to that ble&s;&s;ed Life, but by the <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> of that Life that did grieve the Spirit of God, and which did cau&s;e Man to be driven out; there is no other Way of returning

again but by this <HI>new Birth.</HI> As <HI>you</HI> are <HI>all</HI> driven and forced out of Paradi&s;e, and the flaming Sword and the Cherubims are &s;et to keep the Way of the Tree of Life, &s;o you mu&s;t return into the Favour of God again, by the Light of Chri&s;t; and you have Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept, here a lit|tle, and there a little, to direct your Minds to the Light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. As the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> was made a living Soul, &s;o the &s;econd <HI>Adam</HI> is a quickning Spirit. This know for certain, no Man or Woman can be quickned, and rai&s;ed up into the Life of the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> till the Life of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> be taken away from them.</P>
<P>So now, let every one of you deal plainly with your own Hearts, how you came to be a &s;lain Peo|ple to the Life of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> in which Life there was a Working of the My&s;tery of Iniquity in every Part of Man. One cries, Lo here is Chri&s;t! ano|ther, Lo there is Chri&s;t! and every one is follow|ing his own Imagination about the Letter of the Scripture; this is &s;till but the vain Spirit of Man, running and <HI>&s;triving to recover him&s;elf;</HI> and this is the Cau&s;e there is &s;o much Profe&s;&s;ion of God, and &s;o little of his Nature appearing among the Sons and Daughters of Men. Now all of you that come to be Regenerated, you mu&s;t come to the Light of Chri&s;t, there is no other Way to it. He will &s;earch your Hearts, and try your Reins, and &s;et your Sins in Order before you, and trace out the Iniquities that compa&s;s you about; therefore <HI>you mu&s;t &s;ee your|&s;elves a lo&s;t People, a &s;inful People,</HI> and &s;o come to <HI>feel</HI> the <HI>Weight</HI> of your Sins upon your Con&s;ciences, there is <HI>no other</HI> Way to come to Life; you will never complain of Sin till you be <HI>burthened</HI> with it, till you have a Trumpet &s;ounding in your Ears, to <HI>awaken</HI> you, that you may ari&s;e from the Dead, that Chri&s;t may give you Light; <HI>there is no other Way,</HI>

dear People; you mu&s;t bring your Deeds to the Light of Chri&s;t, and <HI>abide in the Sentence of Condem|nation;</HI> if you &s;ave your Lives, you lo&s;e them; if you will lo&s;e your Lives for Chri&s;t's Sake, there is no Danger of your eternal Life. <HI>John</HI> the Bap|ti&s;t, Chri&s;t's Forerunner, declared, <HI>I indeed bapti&s;e you with Water unto Repentance, but he that cometh af|ter me is mightier than I, the Latchet of who&s;e Shoes I am not worthy to unloo&s;e, he &s;hall bapti&s;e you with the Holy Gho&s;t and with Fire, who&s;e Fan is in his Hand, and he will thoroughly purge his Floor, and will gather his Wheat into his Garner, but the Chaff he will burn with unquenchable Fire.</HI> What is it the better for you to read the Scripture, if you know not this <HI>Fiery Bapti&s;m,</HI> which all mu&s;t know that are rege|nerated; deceive not your&s;elves, Chri&s;t will <HI>appear in flaming Fire, and take Vengeance on all them that know not God, and that obey not the Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;tand here as a Witne&s;s of the Lord of Life this Day; there is no Way for People to come to Sal|vation, but they mu&s;t <HI>know Chri&s;t</HI> revealed in all their Hearts. What is he doing but <HI>rendering Ven|geance</HI> upon the carnal Mind, &s;elf-plea&s;ing and all inordinate Affections; he comes with <HI>Vengeance</HI> to take away thy Life, he will bapti&s;e thee with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with <HI>Fire.</HI> If thou knowe&s;t not this, <HI>thou art not a true Chri&s;tian,</HI> thou wilt never look Death in the Face with Joy, nor go down to the Grave with Triumph. If thou live&s;t at Home in the Body, and flye&s;t for thy Life, and will not be willing to lo&s;e thy Life for Chri&s;t, if thou art called to it; and if thou <HI>wilt not have Chri&s;t to wa&s;h thee</HI> (&s;ome for Shyne&s;s, and &s;ome for Self-Love will refu&s;e this,) if Chri&s;t doth not wa&s;h thee, thou ha&s;t no Part in him; you mu&s;t come to Chri&s;t to purify you in the fiery Furnace; <HI>the Day of the Lord

<P>It is God's infinite Goodne&s;s to Men, that he will <HI>hide Pride</HI> from them, and <HI>humble them</HI> under his mighty Hand.

They that have this Bapti&s;m enter into the Heavenly Life. If you love the Light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, it will be thus with you; God will make &s;hort Work in the Earth. He will <HI>&s;et thy Sins in Order before thee,</HI> and make thee watchful unto Prayer, and lead thee to Holi|ne&s;s of Life and Conver&s;ation, and make thee <HI>ab|hor thy&s;elf,</HI> and <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI> all the Pomps and Plea&s;ures and Vanities of this World. When he hath adorn|ed thee with his Graces, then watch for the Light, and in the Light of Chri&s;t thou &s;halt &s;ee Light, and that all thou ha&s;t done, and can&s;t do, is but thy Duty.

But now is the Acceptable Time, now is the Day of Salvation, the Day of God's Grace and favourable Vi&s;itation, wherein he vi&s;its Men and Women, Il|luminates their Minds and Spirits with a <HI>Light</HI> from Heaven, that they might &s;ee the deplorable State and Condition wherin they are, and what they are doing: It is in this <HI>Light,</HI> that they have a <HI>Day of Grace</HI> vouch&s;afed to them, that it will be well with them, both here and for ever. They that receive this <HI>Light,</HI> and come out of that which they are cal|led from, which is <HI>Sin,</HI> they may come to enjoy <HI>Peace</HI> with <HI>God.</HI> It was <HI>Sin</HI> that fir&s;t &s;eparated be|tween <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man;</HI> and it is <HI>Sin</HI> now that hinders Man from Acquaintance with the <HI>Lord,</HI> who brings Peace unto him: It is by this <HI>Light,</HI> that we are to acquaint our &s;elves with God, that we may be at Peace. Thus &s;aith the Lord by the Prophet, <HI>It is Sin hath &s;eparated between me and you: Sin</HI> hath made a <HI>Partition Wall</HI> between God and us, and God hath &s;ent his Son into the World to break down this <HI>Partition Wall</HI> that <HI>Sin</HI> hath made; that &s;o fal|len Man might return to God, and come into <HI>Para|di&s;e</HI> again, out of which Sin hath ca&s;t him.</P>
<P>Now, none can bring us back to God, and into Favour and Communion with him, but our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> He is the Light and Leader of his

There is no Name under Heaven by which we can be &s;aved, but the <HI>Name</HI> of <HI>JESUS:</HI> It is he that &s;aves his People from their Sins; and it is in him alone that we are ble&s;&s;ed: <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is he who&s;e Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is forgiven, and who&s;e Sin is covered:</HI> And for the Sake of Chri&s;t alone it is, that the Lord imputeth not Iniquity to us.

<P>This was te&s;tified of old, <HI>John</HI> i. 12. <HI>But as many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</HI> Men want <HI>Power</HI> over their Sins: When <HI>Sin</HI> appears to be exceeding &s;inful, they would overcome it, and be rid of it, when it is trouble&s;ome: And when
