<P>THE Indictment was found by the Grand Jury in December Se&s;&s;ions 1793; as &s;oon as it was returned into Court, Mr. Knowlys, of Coun&s;el for the Crown, moved Mr. Ju&s;tice A&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters"> to direct in what Sum the Defendant &s;hould be held to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Indictment was read, and the Sum named by Mr <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">hur&s;t was, THE DEFENDANT HIMSELF IN ONE <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> POUNDS, AND TWO SURETIES IN FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS EACH. The &s;ame Night the Defendant was apprehended and lodged in Newgate, where he lay till the next Se&s;&s;ion, not being able to procure Bail to &s;o large an amount.</P>
<P>When the Trial was to have come on. Mr. Vaughan was too ill to conduct the Defence; it therefore devolved on Mr. Gur|ney.</P>
<P>In January Se&s;&s;ion the Defendant was put to the Bar, and the Jury were about to be &s;worn, when the Defendant challenged two of the Jurors preremptorily; the Recorder di&s;allowed pre|remptory Challenges, and called upon him to a&s;&s;ign a Cau&s;e; the Cau&s;e the Defendant a&s;&s;igned was, that tho&s;e Jurymen had made declarations which rendered them unfit to &s;it upon a Jury to try a Man charged with having publi&s;hed a Libel. Though the De|fendant had no proof of the&s;e declarations having been made, Mr. Fielding very liberally con&s;ented to allow the Challenges; the remainder of the Jury having been di&s;charged, the trial went off for defect of Jurors to February Se&s;&s;ion, and the Defendant was remanded to Newgate.</P>
<P>As Mr. Gurney had prepared him&s;elf to lead the Defence at the January Se&s;&s;ion, Mr. Vaughan, in compliment to him, would not re&s;ume it afterwards.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. FIELDING.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen of the jury,</P>
<P>Your attention, as a Jury of the City of London, is called to another pro&s;ecution for the publication of a mi&s;chievous and &s;edi|tious Libel. I &s;ay another, for true it is there have been many
<PB N="9" REF="026931_0010_0FD26666CDF1B3C0">
pro&s;ecutions for offences of this de&s;cription, and unle&s;s it be that your &s;ervants, the &s;ervants of the public in re&s;pon&s;ible &s;ituations in Government, and particularly that &s;ervant of the public, the At|torney-General, &s;hould be remi&s;s where he ought to be active &s;hould be &s;luggi&s;h where he ought to be alert, or be a&s;leep when he ought to be awake, pro&s;ecutions of this nature mu&s;t come be|fore you. When they do come before you, they come before the tribunal be&s;t calculated to determine upon every thing that &s;uch a pro&s;ecution imputes, and before the tribunnal be&s;t calculated to determine upon the innocence or guilt of the accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Gentlemen. I take upon me to a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf, that you are all well aware of the nature and extent of the duty you are now ex|erci&s;ing. There have been agitations lately about the power of a Jury, and the interpo&s;ition of a Court; the differences always &s;eemed to me extremely trifling; but now there is no kind of he&s;itation as to the extent of the proper province of a Jury upon &s;uch occa&s;ions as the pre&s;ent:&mdash;it is this, and God forbid it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, that in the very frame work of the crime, the Jury &s;hould have a full cognizance of it, and a full juri&s;diction over it: that the Jury &s;hould be alone the judges, as to the nature and ex|tent of the criminality charged; that neither the book it&s;elf nor a paragraph extracted from the book, nor any expre&s;&s;ion &s;hall be &s;aid to be criminal, unle&s;s the Jury go with that idea, which forms a part of the Indictment, imputing to the publi&s;her the cri|minal intention a&s;cribed upon that Indictment. God be prai&s;ed, that power is fully acknowledged. All that the officer of the Crown has done in this in&s;tance is, and with a vigilance becoming him, to &s;ee that the matter imputed to the pri&s;oner now, &s;hould come before a Jury of the City of London for their determination. What the duty of the Attorney-General was, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, is as it were your duty now. You are to look at the circum&s;tan|ces as he has done; but you have a greater power than he has, for you are to determine upon the guilt or innoeence of the party accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I confe&s;s in the agitation of que&s;tions relative to libel, it has frequently &s;truck my mind, &s;ome things perhaps had been better without pro&s;ecution, and that pro&s;ecutions ought to be directed again&s;t others; but in the re&s;ult of all the&s;e enquiries as far as my mind has enabled me to come to a re&s;ult, I can only lament the imperfection of all po&s;&s;ible human e&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>
<P>If &s;edition were &s;uffered to be &s;cattered abroad among the peo|ple in any po&s;&s;ible way, to be &s;ure any man of common &s;en&s;e mu&s;t ea&s;ily and readily go along with me in &s;aying, that infinite mi&s;|chief mu&s;t follow. What then is to be done? It is the duty of that great law cfficer of the country, the Attorney-General, when
<PB N="10" REF="026931_0011_0FD266612285F788">
he has information from the different per&s;ons who are employed under him, and by his directions to inform him of tho&s;e things that are going on in &s;ociety; if they &s;hould appear to have a dan|gerous tendency, it highly becomes him to put them in a &s;tate of inquiry, that puni&s;hment may follow where puni&s;hment is de&s;er|ved, and that puni&s;hment may follow under the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in this country according only to the law; that idea is con|veyed in a &s;hort Latin &s;entence, which I will beg leave to tran&s;|late: Puni&s;hment is only intended <HI>"ut paena in paucas metus in om|nes incidat;"</HI> that is, that the puni&s;hment which mu&s;t follow the conviction of the crime, &s;hould only fall upon a few, and falling up|on a few glaring offenders, that all &s;hould apprehend the danger of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Attorney-General, who cannot do him&s;elf the honor of at|tending before you to-day, and therefore it devolves upon me, in my humble &s;tation, to repre&s;ent this ca&s;e to you, he would have &s;aid this if he had been here, which I will &s;ay for him. I have now di&s;charged my duty, I only &s;ubmit the que&s;tion to you, and it is for you to decide; he can do no more, and I am &s;ure you will do your duty, as he has done his.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the particular charge which has been &s;tated by my friend, and had before been &s;tated to you by the Officer of the Court, I &s;hall beg the liberty of calling your attention to again. But before I do this, let me remark, that when a man is pro&s;ecuted for words &s;poken, it &s;eldom happens, unle&s;s the behaviour of the per&s;on has furni&s;hed evidence again&s;t him&s;elf, either by the man|ner in which he has &s;poken the words, the place in which he has &s;poken the words, or other circum&s;tances, that the evidence of in|tention can &s;o fairly be got at, as to leave no doubt what ever. In a publication, likewi&s;e, it may &s;ome times be difficult to come at the intent of the author; but in order to do that, you mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily go into the context, and into the whole publication. Where it can ari&s;e as a defence for the man accu&s;ed, that the words which are &s;elected for pro&s;ecution convey a different mean|ing when taken in detached &s;entences, from what they bear in connection with the general context, it is fair that he &s;hould have that defence; he &s;hould have the advantage of the whole taken to|gether. So on the contrary, if the whole being taken together manife&s;ts the intention of a part, it is equally proper, that as the evidence on one &s;ide may be in his &s;avor, &s;o on the other &s;ide it is to be con&s;idered whether it is not again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the paragraphs &s;elected here, and which are &s;tated upon this Indictment by nece&s;&s;ary innuendos, as they are called in law, that is when a part n &s;aid to be offen&s;ive, it is nece&s;&s;ary, in point of law, that that very expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be &s;o pointed out,

and &s;hould be &s;aid to be &s;o far criminal, as that it means &s;o and &s;o; whether the meaning be fair or not, it is you province to determine. Now, Gentlemen, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance the para|graph which has been &s;elected is of this nature.</P>
<P><Q>You mu&s;t know then that I u&s;ed, together with a variety of youthful attachments, to be very fond of birds and poultry, and among other things of this kind I had a very fine maje&s;tie kind of animal, a Game Cock,</Q>&mdash;meaning thereby, as we have taken upon us to &s;tate upon this record, to allude to the per&s;on of his Maje&s;ty.&mdash;Gentlemen, this is the meaning which is a&s;crib|ed to it, whether it bears this meaning is your province as I &s;aid before to determine. Then Gentlemen, you are to judge of it in this way; it makes it's appearance in a pamphlet, price two-pence, entitled&mdash; "Politics for the People."&mdash;Politics for the People&mdash;For whom is it meant? Is it not meant to be circulated among the people? according to the common acceptation of the term people. Politics&mdash;circum&s;tances of public agitation &s;ub|mitted to the con&s;ideration of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Then the fir&s;t part of the title is&mdash;"Politics for the People," it goes on "or Hog's Wa&s;h." I dare &s;ay, Gentlemen, hat many of you can account for the adoption of that term, <HI>Hog's Wa&s;h.</HI> I confe&s;s it &s;trikes me that, it has been taken up by the author of this book, as a &s;ort of comment upon a term or terms which e&s;caped in the heat of debate in parliament from &s;ome member there. I remember &s;ome expre&s;&s;ion being made u&s;e of which has undergone a variety of comments, where the SWINISH MULTITUDE had been the term u&s;ed. I confe&s;s I would not have been the per&s;on to have made u&s;e of &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion; but, however, it does not &s;eem to me to convey &s;uch an idea as ju&s;tifies the following it up with &s;uch comments, for it has been followed up with a continuance of comment which has extended the meaning, I am per&s;uaded, infinitely beyond the mind of the Gentleman who made u&s;e of it; it might have been reprehen&s;ible, I do not &s;ay but it was reprehen&s;ible, but the intention a&s;cribed here is infi|nitely wor&s;e, u&s;ing the words in this way is much more likely to produce the very effect which we &s;ay this libel is calculated to produce.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, yon &s;ee the title of this pamphlet is&mdash;<Q>Politics for the people; or, Hog's Wa&s;h;</Q> indeed it is intituled <Q>num|ber 8,</Q> &s;o as to manife&s;t that there have been many preceding this publication; its price is two pence. It begins indeed with poe|try, which you will have an opportunity of &s;eeing by and by if you plea&s;e, but as I have much to &s;ay to you upon the pre&s;ent pro|&s;ecution, I will not wa&s;te your time by adverting to circum&s;tan|ces that are immaterial. The poetry in the fir&s;t part, I am con|tended

<P>Gentlemen, then we come to the &s;econd page, at the top of which there appears this&mdash; <Q> King Chaunteclere, or the Fate of Tyranny;</Q> and it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be <Q>An anecdote related by Ci|tizen Thelwall at the Capel Court Society, during the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a que&s;tion relative to the comparative influence of the Love of Life and Liberty, and of the Fair Sex, on the actions of mankind.</Q> I &s;hall not wa&s;te much of your time in commenting upon either the pa&s;&s;age I have read, or what follows, &s;aving this, that Mr. Thelwall is repre&s;ented as di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this que&s;tion, and as di&s;cu&s;&s;ing tho&s;e matters which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to relate to the love of life and the love of liberty; and if you can put any other interpretation upon it than that which readily &s;tarts into my mind, for God's &s;ake do it: but &s;ee if it be not this, if the very agita|tion of that que&s;tion is not to beget a &s;ort of indifference about the &s;hedding of human blood, driving, as it were, the mind to a con|tempt of danger, and &s;etting up an ideal liberty, not a real one; but making von &s;uppo&s;e, or attempting to make you &s;uppo&s;e, that every other thing but liberty, as they are plea&s;ed to call it, is to be held in contempt; that every thing which &s;tands in the way of it, that any thing which may under any po&s;&s;ibility be deemed likely to beget tyranny, is to be got rid of, ina&s;much as it is in the way of that liberty; and that Kings are in the way of liberty, and are only to be got rid of by death, by cutting off the head.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it would be impertinent in me to &s;uppo&s;e that you were not as conver&s;ant as my&s;elf with the evils that pervade a neighbouring country. It would be impertinent in me to &s;uppo&s;e you are not equally apprized of the fatal and melancholy cata&s;tro|phe attending the late King of France: but before I comment fur|ther upon this pa&s;&s;age, let me call your attention to another little paragraph appearing in this book, which I declare to God when I fir&s;t read I could not get over without tears. The circum&s;tance is mentioned in &s;uch a flippant way&punc; and &s;o oppo&s;ite to the feelings of a man of common humanity, that I think you will go with me in your feelings as &s;oon as ever I &s;tate this little paragraph to you.</P>
<P>You have heard that there was a man on the other &s;ide of the water of the name of Mon&s;ieur Condorcet. This is a paragraph that the author of this book has in&s;erted under the title of "Re|flections of a True Briton:" but before I read the paragraph, I will confe&s;s that my mind is relieved a little in not being obliged to lock upon that man as the author. I pro&s;ecute him only as the
<PB N="13" REF="026931_0014_0FD2666B2A285008">
publi&s;her. If I were to look upon him as the author, my eye could I hardly turn towards him without a fla&s;h of indignation: but I am relieved from that by his being pro&s;ecuted as the pub|li&s;her, and not as the author. Now, Gentlemen, ob&s;erve the flip|pant, the unfeeling, the cruel manner in which a tran&s;action like that to which I have alluded is mentioned&mdash;<Q>Mon&s;ieur Con|dorcet, when he announced in his gazette that our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> had been &s;hut up on the news of Louis Capet's death, plea&s;antly ob&s;erved, <HI>That it was not the common players who acted in the farce of that day.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now what does this betoken? A min<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> looking at a tran&s;action of that &s;ort with a degree of plea&s;ure and unconcern. There is a common idea, and I am &s;ure it is impre&s;&s;ed upon every man's mind, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t in &s;ociety, and which fre|quently manife&s;ts it&s;elf in an expre&s;&s;ion of that &s;ort&mdash;<Q>Had my dog met with &s;uch a fate, I &s;hould have regretted him:</Q> but, heavenly God! can we dive&s;t our&s;elves of tho&s;e feelings that grow up with us in &s;ociety, and under the indulgence of which we are indebted for every po&s;&s;ible human felicity: for without feelings of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, what would the human being be? Gentlemen, we have at this day but too many opportunities of &s;eeing <HI>what a bea&s;t</HI> a human being is, when he breaks loo&s;e from the bonds of &s;ociety, and betakes him&s;elf to tho&s;e cour&s;es which follow from anarchy and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>This paragraph, therefore, is found in this book; I &s;ay, that is lamentable indeed; but it is found in a chapter thus de&s;cribed, "The Reflections of a True Briton." God forbid that that cha|racter, which &s;tands almo&s;t above all others in the world, a Briton, a manly, a true Briton, God forbid that he &s;hould ever be found to have a heart like that, a characteri&s;tic which impeaches the hu|manity and feeling of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that can never be the reflection of a true Briton: bur the author, whoever he be, that has a&s;&s;umed this character, has traduced the name and character of a true Bri|ton, when he a&s;&s;umes him&s;elf to be &s;uch, and follows a cour&s;e like that which I have repre&s;ented to you.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this chapter contains that which is the &s;ubject of another count in this indictment: "Kings are wolf &s;hepherds." Will you permit me for a moment to digre&s;s a little into that which I hope will ever remain a &s;ubject unattacked? Shall it be allowed to a man to impo&s;e upon fair ander&s;tandings, having mi&s;|chief in his mind, and having no po&s;&s;ible earthly good purpo&s;e; &s;hall it be allowed to &s;uch a man to &s;ay, Here I am as a friend of mankind agitating a fair que&s;tion? God forbid that fair di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion &s;hould be ever the &s;ubject of an attack, or &s;hould ever call upon you for your deliberation. Fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion upon points of
<PB N="14" REF="026931_0015_0FD2666C6F6C6D38">
government is as open to the &s;ubject and as allowable as the agita|tion of any other que&s;tions; and I will be bold to &s;ay, that never yet was it &s;uppo&s;ed, from the beginning of civil &s;ociety to the pre&s;ent hour, that the man who meant fairly, who&s;e heart moved hone&s;tly, who was an u&s;eful member of &s;ociety, who could be &s;aid to be a good father, a good hu&s;band, a kind neighbour, and who was endowed with the common &s;ocial feelings, it never yet was &s;aid that there could be a doubt whether &s;uch a man meant fairly when di&s;cu&s;&s;ing topics of this de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Many attempts have been made to pervert the under&s;tanding of tho&s;e who have the ultimate juri&s;diction: for, God knows, it has happened but too frequently in our profe&s;&s;ion, that ingenuity has been carried to the utmo&s;t height, a thing allowable in the advo|cate, to give the mo&s;t plau&s;ible interpretation, or the mo&s;t favour|able comment, where there has been any pretence for calling the work under pro&s;ecution, fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. But I need not trouble you on this &s;ubject, ina&s;much as this varies as much from every &s;pecies of libel of that kind, as any thing the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant can from the mo&s;t important.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, now let me call your attention a little to that which is the &s;pecific &s;ubject of the indictment, and &s;ee whether you can affix any other than that very meaning that is put upon the whole of this &s;entence by the inuendoes. If you can, you will: but judge of it fairly, and &s;ee if it does not import this, for I think it cannot import any thing el&s;e. <Q>You mu&s;t know then that I u&s;ed, together with a variety of youthful attachments, to be very fond of birds and poultry; and, among other things of this kind, I had a very fine maje&s;tic kind of animal, a game cock, a haughty &s;anguinary tyrant, nur&s;ed in blood and &s;laughter from his infancy, fond of foreign wars and <HI>dome&s;tic rebellions,</HI> into which he would &s;ometimes drive his &s;ubjects by his oppre&s;&s;ive ob&s;tinacy, in hopes that he might increa&s;e his power and glory by their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, without going any further in &s;tating that which is the particular and &s;pecific ground of this indictment, can you have a doubt upon this? Then &s;o far I am &s;ure I may take the liberty of &s;aying, that I have not a doubt <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> your minds will go with me as to the meaning which is affixed to the&s;e words.</P>
<P>Then we come to that which is the main part of the enquiry, and of every jury's enquiry upon a &s;ubject of this &s;ort, <HI>the intention of the man.</HI> If the author were &s;tanding before you, it would be impo&s;&s;ible in the nature of things for any ingenuity upon earth to &s;ay that he had a fair, a kind, or a good intention. What is it calculated, what is it intended for? To go among the people, to be bought up by them at two-pence a-peece. So it is to be circu|lated;
<PB N="15" REF="026931_0016_0FD2667143FAFB60">
and whatever is to be inferred from this &s;tory is to bt im|pre&s;&s;ed upon their minds.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I confe&s;s very lately when I was looking over a French publication, a pamphlet of Mon&s;ieur Bri&s;&s;ot's, there was a pa&s;&s;age in it that &s;truck me with a&s;toni&s;hment at the neatne&s;s of the de&s;cription and the ju&s;tne&s;s of the remark, as to the con&s;equence which mu&s;t take place wherever the circum&s;tances exi&s;t which gave ri&s;e to the ob&s;ervation; it &s;truck me, I &s;ay, with a&s;toni&s;h|ment. He is &s;peaking of the terrible want of order in that coun|try, of the manner in which di&s;contents are di&s;&s;eminated; and he carries his attention down to the poor cottager, who being poi|&s;oned him&s;elf, carries the contagion not only to his own home, but &s;preads it around his little hut. So it is with every thing of this &s;ort, &s;o it is indeed, to make u&s;e of a &s;imile: if a &s;tone be thrown into the water, at fir&s;t we perceive a little circle upon the &s;urface, another &s;till &s;ucceeds, and then another, till the whole circumfer|ence, which is immen&s;e, is de&s;cribed in that circle. And, Gentle|men, when we look at the po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;&s;eminating di&s;contents, we mu&s;t always &s;ee that the beginning mu&s;t be of this nature.</P>
<P>What then is this calculated for? Not to meet the eye, not to reach the ear, not to be an object of &s;earch of any man of litera|ture, of any gentlemen &s;uch as you: but it is calculated to find its way among the lowe&s;t of the people, to excite them to di&s;contents and commotions. Such&punc; and &s;uch only, can be its purpo&s;e. The very nature of the publication, the price, the title of it, all manife&s;t this If it were to come to the attention, if it were to fall before the eye of any men better informed than the rude and vulgar, per|haps they would have looked upon it as contemptible. But al|though it is &s;o contemptible, it does not follow that it is not the le&s;s mi&s;chievous. The ob&s;ervation I make to you for your appro|bation is, that it is infinitely more mi&s;chievous, the more the thing is calculated to harra&s;s and di&s;turb the lower order of the people.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, no man is hardy enough to expo&s;e him&s;elf at once to the immediate fang of the law. Bad minds have always their contrivances about them: but God be prai&s;ed, for the benefit of &s;ociety, tho&s;e contrivances &s;eldom are capable of avail: they fre|quently expo&s;e their authors to puni&s;hment. So it is here. Not that this man, or the author, whoever he may have been, would dare openly to have attacked the King of this country, or would dare openly to &s;ay to any part of the multitude, Do this or that; nor would he do &s;o in his writing: but there is a contrivance made u&s;e of, it is written in a &s;pecies of fable; a &s;pecies of &s;imile or allegory, as it is called, is u&s;ed to convey tho&s;e &s;entiments. But whatever the contrivance may be, we are to re&s;ort to that which
<PB N="16" REF="026931_0017_0FD266735C192168">
is capable of unravelling the my&s;tery in both in&s;tances; namely, the fair and &s;ober enquiry of a jury. And whatever the nature of the concealment may be, if a man makes u&s;e of a &s;imilitude, if he is charged with meaning the King by the character of a Cock, it is for you fairly to &s;ay whether he had not this meaning; and there|fore it is that there is no po&s;&s;ible device or artifice of a man that &s;hall &s;creen him from the inve&s;tigation of a jury: and if a jury conceive he has &s;o wrought up this matter by putting upon it any &s;ort of flim&s;y concealment, they will &s;trip the veil from it, they will look at it, and &s;ee what the matter is that is &s;o concealed. So in this ca&s;e the author has endeavoured, by alluding to a game cock, to conceal his intention.</P>
<P>But, Gentlemen, I call your attention mo&s;t earne&s;tly to that which Citizen Thelwall, as he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be, is di&s;cu&s;&s;ing in this libel. You will &s;ee from the part which precedes, and the circum&s;tances that follow, there could have been no other object in the mind of the author than tho&s;e objects to which I have al|luded.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, when you travel a little further on in this publica|tion (the book is not large, it would not take you up above ten minutes to read it all through) I will not indeed in&s;ult you by &s;uppo&s;ing that any of you have read it with any attention, though it may have got by accident into your hands very fairly, and you may have looked at it, and may have laughed at part of it: but you will find another part which manife&s;ts what the intention of the man is. He is fir&s;t of all commenting upon the nature of the right which every &s;ubject has in this country, to in&s;i&s;t upon a free and open di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. God forbid that free and open di&s;cu&s;&s;ion &s;hould ever be abridged. And how can it be abridged? It can never be but by tho&s;e men who are the wor&s;t enemies to &s;ociety, abu&s;ing the liberty of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. So it is with the liberty of the pre&s;s, the mo&s;t invaluable ble&s;&s;ing, at the mention of which every man is alive. There is no man can check another's publication of his thoughts, whatever his thoughts may be: but if tho&s;e thoughts turn out to be mi&s;chievous to the public, and, in&s;tead of &s;erving the purpo&s;es of mankind, threaten their ruin and de&s;truction, God forbid that tho&s;e thoughts &s;o promulgated &s;hould not provoke an enquiry, for then they become the fair objects of puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The liberty of the pre&s;s, that boa&s;t, and highe&s;t boa&s;t almo&s;t of an Engli&s;hman, how is that to be endangered? It may be in dan|ger, for aught I know, in &s;ucceeding generations; and I am &s;ure, if ever it is put in danger, it will be by the abu&s;es of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;e who are the greate&s;t enemies to it, at the very time they are putting on the audacious effrontery of pretendiug to be its friends. Tho&s;e men who are the authors and publi&s;hers of things like this, are at
<PB N="17" REF="026931_0018_0FD26674EA886D80">
all times the men to &s;tand forward with the mo&s;t unblu&s;hing ef|frontery, and &s;ay, the liberty of the pre&s;s is violated in our per|&s;ons; con&s;cious as they are that they are the men who&s;e conduct, originating in the wor&s;t motives, is calculated to produce mi&s;chiefs innumerable in &s;ociety; well knowing that they de&s;erve no pro|tection, being in the very abu&s;e of that which ought to be looked upon as the chiefe&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of the country. So it is with publi|cations of this &s;ort. This circum&s;tance is a&s;&s;umed in another part of the book. Mr. Thelwall, the character &s;uppo&s;ed to be in being here, and upon the &s;cene, is repre&s;ented as attacked during the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the que&s;tion; and there is a &s;entiment which he brings forward in con&s;equence of that attack, which is of an ex|tremely dangerous nature indeed. After having mentioned what had pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ociety, he &s;ays,&mdash; <Q>The&s;e circum&s;tances are im|portant to be generally known; &s;ince they prove that notwith|&s;tanding the fal&s;e appearances which have been artfully a&s;&s;umed by intriguing and intere&s;ted individuals, pretending to more au|thority than they have, there is no power in this country that can openly and legally interfere to prevent the freedom of poli|tical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, if individuals will have &s;pirit enough to a&s;&s;ert it.</Q></P>
<P>What is this but &s;aying, to any parcel of people that may be collected together in any place, "Gentlemen, if you have indivi|dually &s;pirit enough to a&s;&s;ert, and in&s;i&s;t upon any &s;ort of freedom that you think proper, have but that &s;pirit in the individual, the accumulated &s;pirit of tho&s;e individuals mu&s;t be capable of carrying into effect whatever your intention may be." Is it any thing el&s;e, is it &s;hort of that? Then you &s;ee that the&s;e few pages contain nothing but political matters, and nothing on tho&s;e &s;ubjects but &s;uch &s;ort of ideas as are calculated to di&s;turb and harra&s;s the public mind. What is this? It is called, "Politics for the people"&mdash;to be &s;cattered among the people.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I think I need not further advert either to the pam|phlet, to the charge, or to that which ari&s;es out of the pamphlet, or out of the charge. I will make a few ob&s;ervations upon the nature of the&s;e pro&s;ecutions, and upon the defences &s;et up. The&s;e pro&s;ecutions, I &s;ay, mu&s;t be in&s;tituted, becau&s;e there is no other mode in this country, or upon earth, by which publications of this &s;ort can be checked. If you think fit, or if you think &s;ociety would be benefited by the&s;e things having their free cour&s;e unin|terrupted, your wi&s;hes, if they &s;hould incline that way, may, for what I know, act upon your minds &s;o as to prevail upon you to believe that there can be no harm in this pamphlet: but I am per|&s;uaded that is impo&s;&s;ible in minds like yours.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, and truly, that whenever a libel is pro&s;ecuted,
<PB N="18" REF="026931_0019_0FD266762E37C980">
it draws it into a &s;econd cour&s;e of agitation; and that the very ob&s;ervations made upon the lible in a court of ju&s;tice, become, as it were a promulgation of the libel it&s;elf. That is extremely true, and it has happened over and over again; it has happened within my own time, and happened, I am &s;ure, in times before, that the matter being brought forth, and the ob&s;ervations made upon it, which are indeed nece&s;&s;ary, and my learned friend, who is of coun|&s;el for the defendant to-day, I am &s;ure will exerci&s;e his ingenuity; and in doing &s;o, he will do no more than his duty to his client. H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> ingenuity is equal to much. I venture to think his di&s;play of talents upon this occa&s;ion will be &s;uch as to excite admiration; and the more admiration it is attended with, I hope I know my|&s;elf when I &s;ay, the more plea&s;ure I &s;hall feel. I &s;hall be extremely happy to find that my friend, in the ob&s;ervations he can po&s;&s;ibly offer to you upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, &s;hall de&s;erve your approba|tion, and &s;hall de&s;erve your admiration.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, whatever the talents may be when they are exerted in a ca&s;e where exertion can hardly produce any effect, and where the influence of that exertion, however you may admire the ta|lents of the advocate, cannot po&s;&s;ibly go the length of convincing your judgments, or in any mea&s;ure of altering the determination you are to make; we admire the advocate who is on the wrong &s;ide of the que&s;tion, for the eloquence and learning which he &s;hews: but, thank God, in this country there is a tribunal which is to decide, after all the exertions of the advocate. You will enquire into the naked fact. The pre&s;ent ca&s;e is indeed more complicated: but in the examination you are to make, the que&s;|tion mu&s;t be &s;tripped at la&s;t of all the ob&s;ervations that I can make, feeble as they are, and it will be equally &s;tripped of all the ob&s;ervations my learned friend will make, &s;trong as they will be, putting all tho&s;e out of the ca&s;e, at the &s;ame time judging and de|termining whether I have called upon you to exerci&s;e either your feelings or your judgments, and under&s;tandings, in any way but in a fair and impartial manner, you will decide this. ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have not read the whole of the pa&s;&s;age to you that is &s;elected from this pamphlet, and put upon the record, becau&s;e it goes down at la&s;t to tho&s;e allu&s;ions which are &s;o palpable, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, in the nature of things, that they can be mi&s;taken. The trappings of rovalty are mentioned; there is every &s;ort of &s;i|militude, and every &s;ort of allu&s;ion, from whence to infer that the trapping are meant to apply to royalty, and royalty as exi&s;ting in this country; that the King him&s;elf is that &s;pecies of tyrant that ought to be got rid of, and that is only to be got rid of by that in&s;tument which is alluded to in another part of the little book,
<PB N="19" REF="026931_0020_0FD26677A394E300">
which you, I am &s;ure, will &s;ee when you come to look at it, to be the unavoidable meaning to be affixed to it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I would not wi&s;h to aggravate any ca&s;e to you; but does not this appear to he ferocious and &s;avage? Suppo&s;ing it to have that allu&s;ion which I have attributed to it, and to be di&s;|tributed among the people, what are the ends that the writer pro|po&s;es by it? The ends of it are to render the people ferocious, to render them bloody, to render them cruel, and to di&s;po&s;e them to carry into effect &s;uch an act of cruelty at would plunge this country into a &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s indeed. This I would &s;ay it the end propo&s;ed the inevitable con&s;equences that mu&s;t take place from the circulation of a book of this &s;ort among the people. I have &s;tated that it is mo&s;t evidently calculated for the lowe&s;t of the people, and not to reach any higher circles; and therefore it is in|finitely more mi&s;chievous than any libel, except one, that was ever pro&s;ecuted, which was calculated for another purpo&s;e, and that was defended under an idea of the freedom of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, tho' not ju&s;tified. Ju&s;tification will hardly ever follow; and I am &s;ure when minds like yours view the &s;ubject fairly, and &s;ee that when what is &s;aid it not to be palliated, is not to be excu&s;ed, and can|not be ju&s;tified, &s;omething may be &s;aid upon a que&s;tion, however obvious it may be, however plain a propo&s;ition may be to my mind, &s;omething may be &s;aid upon it; and I may he&s;itate a little; but with the fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a common under&s;tanding, looking at all points which are the fair objects of human contemplation, the human mind will be at la&s;t capable of coming to a true con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Without reading any more of this book to you, which you will read after you have referred to tho&s;e parts to which I have more immediately alluded, the conclu&s;ion &s;eems to pre&s;ent it&s;elf to the mind in only one &s;hape; and it is not in the power of quibble, of ingenuity, or wit, or any &s;pecies of faculty that belongs to the human mind, to put any other interpretation upon it than that given by the record.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, there will be one more &s;ubject of your enquiry, and of your attention: but as I am perfectly a&s;&s;ur<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> that ob&s;ervations relative to that will come from the learned judge who tries this indictment, with infinitely more force than they can come from me, I may &s;pare you the time of attending to &s;uch ob&s;ervations as the&s;e that is upon the nature and the character of the fir&s;t magi&s;|trate in this country. It is highly indecorous, that I am &s;ure you will go with me in &s;aying, for any one in the lea&s;t degree to &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of another again&s;t whom he can have no cau&s;e of complaint: but to &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of this country, is deemed highly indecorous and indecent, and
<PB N="20" REF="026931_0021_0FD26679E9400F00">
his character therefore is for the wi&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es particularly pro|tected.</P>
<P>Then tracing this from the lowe&s;t degree of mi&s;demeanor that can be committed again&s;t the King, tracing it from the lowe&s;t &s;tate to the highe&s;t, pa&s;&s;ing over the intermediate degrees of of|fences, many of them that are trifling, and &s;till &s;topping &s;hort of that which comes within the verge of trea&s;on, can there be an of|fence more aggravated in its kind than this? It is not only treat|ing di&s;re&s;pectfully, but it is treating with a degree of &s;arca&s;m in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, which manife&s;ts a &s;trong malevolence to the cha|racter; and in the next place, it is giving to the mind of every man, that can be impre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch a publication as this, not only an indifference to the character of the King, but a perfect dete&s;ta|tion of &s;uch character, and &s;ugge&s;ting that the means of getting rid of &s;uch a character mu&s;t be by a &s;troke &s;imilar to that which has taken place in a neighbouring unhappy country.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;hall therefore ab&s;tain from all ob&s;ervations upon the royal character, as to the manner in which it is protected here, as to the utility of the office, and as to the benefit and the advantage derived from it by the inhabitants of this country, becau&s;e &s;ure I am you are equally conver&s;ant with the intercour&s;es of commerce, and with the va&s;t and important objects that re&s;ult from commer|cial inrercour&s;e, under the ble&s;&s;ings of a free con&s;titution like ours, where re&s;pect to government in&s;ures that tranquility under which alone tho&s;e commercial benefits can ari&s;e, and happine&s;s to man take place. I &s;ay, therefore, with the effects of the con&s;titution, you are much better acquainted than I am; my walk is in a more confined way than yours; I &s;ee not &s;o much of the manufactures and merchandize of the country, as day after day are to be found in the city of London, and which I will be bold to &s;ay are only to be found in this city; and I will be bold again to &s;ay, that it is alone owing to the form of government that we live under: and again, that unle&s;s the royal per&s;on, the &s;overeign of this country, were at the head of that con&s;titution, the effects would not be what they are.</P>
<P>Then, Gentlemen, to what other circum&s;tances need I advert? I am &s;ure my friend, who is advocate for the defendant, will never &s;uppo&s;e, that by calling your attention to the&s;e words he can frit|ter them away. I think it may be &s;ugge&s;ted, becau&s;e I have heard it before &s;ugge&s;ted, that here, where the cock is mentioned, and we &s;ay in our indictment that it means the King; good God! the advocate may &s;ay (becau&s;e an advocate can always affect a&s;to|ni&s;hment), why &s;hould you &s;uppo&s;e the King is meant by this cock? I can only &s;ay I will leave it to the determination of 12 gentlemen, to &s;ay whether it be &s;o or not, I am &s;ure if cannot be
<PB N="21" REF="026931_0022_0FD2667BC0AD2C08">
otherwi&s;e. And though he may plea&s;e to &s;ay, by your legal ope|ration of an inuendo, you may charge that the cock means the King; why you are the libeller your&s;elf, by putting it upon the record: I can only ob&s;erve, it is extremely ingenious; but you, Gentlemen, will be to determine between us: therefore let inge|nuity be exerci&s;ed, let it have its fair cour&s;e. I am &s;ure my friend will be ingenious. I am &s;ure in his addre&s;s to you there will be much to admire: but it happens, indeed, to be a &s;ubject where there cannot be any great benefit re&s;ulting to his client from it. When my friend has done his duty, I do confe&s;s, feeling this pro&s;ecution as a matter of infinite importance, I &s;hall look with extreme earne&s;tne&s;s for your verdict. I pre&s;ume I &s;hall not have any occa&s;ion to trouble you again, therefore it is fit I &s;hould make all the ob&s;ervations I have to offer now; it is upon that account you will pardon me for the length of time I have taken up.</P>
<P>I have already hinted to you, that we pro&s;ecute this man as the publi&s;her. Now, Gentlemen, when the book is &s;old at his hou&s;e, if he be not there he is as much guilty as if he were. This is a matter very well known to be law from the earlie&s;t time; it is one of the ca&s;es in law, where a ma&s;ter may be criminated by the act of his &s;ervant, even though he him&s;elf he not pre&s;ent. If his wife &s;ells the libel, he is criminal; and unle&s;s it were &s;o, the law would, you &s;ee, be fru&s;trated in thou&s;ands of in&s;tances. The law is, that the owner, of the &s;hop, the man having the profit of the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hall be an&s;werable. But here the book appears to be printed for the very man at the bar, and I dare &s;ay he will hardly deny it; from the manner in which he bears him&s;elf, I do not know whe|ther he might not ab&s;olutely triumph in it. But, however, with re&s;pect to the criminality, and the law attaching upon that crimi|nality, there can be no doubt.</P>
<P>The evidence I &s;hall have to lay before you will be the mo&s;t &s;imple imaginable, that is, that the book was bought at his &s;hop. What relates to the manner in which his bu&s;ine&s;s is generally car|ried, on, I forbear to &s;tate. You perceive that with re&s;pect to the&s;e two charges, I have not even &s;tated them at full length, becau&s;e the book, if you plea&s;e to have it, may be delivered to you, and you may there &s;atisfy your own curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid before, I felt my&s;elf relieved that I had not to pro|&s;ecute that man as the author. He may not be the author: I hope in God he is not. Although he is criminal as the publi&s;her, and although the publisher does infinitely more mi&s;chief &s;ometimes than the author, and often has it happened that the publi&s;her is a &s;timulator to the author; yet I hope he has not the heart to be the author of &s;ome of the&s;e paragraphs.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="026931_0023_0FD2667E64C29D30">Gentlemen, you have the ca&s;e before you. I have done my duty, the attorney general has done his, and tho&s;e gentlemen who have been engaged in order to bring the pro&s;ecution into a &s;hape before you, di&s;charge their duty when they &s;ubmit it to you; and it would be mo&s;t impertinent in me to &s;ugge&s;t a po&s;&s;ibility of your doing otherwi&s;e than your duty.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is extremely unfortunate for the defendant, Mr. Eaton, it is perhaps not le&s;s unfortunate for me, that the indi&s;po&s;ition of my learned leader Mr. Vaughan, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and his delicacy in the &s;econd, occa&s;ion the ta&s;k of addre&s;&s;ing you this day to de|volve upon me. It is unfortunate for the defendant, becau&s;e he lo&s;es the benefit; of tho&s;e &s;plendid talents which have been exerted once and again in his behalf, not without &s;ucce&s;s: It is unfortunate for me, becau&s;e it &s;ets tho&s;e &s;plendid talents, to a certain degree, in contra&s;t with talents of a very oppo&s;ite de&s;cription. But I feel my&s;elf con&s;oled, I feel my&s;elf animated by this con&s;ideration, that, notwith&s;tanding all you have hitherto heard to the defence of this indictment, the meane&s;t talents are more than equal.</P>
<P>If this pro&s;ecution could a&s;&s;ume a &s;hape other than the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting, it would undoubtedly receive it from the very liberal, able, and eloquent manner in which it has been opened by my learned friend. But to fix an agreeable ma&s;k upon it, is not within the compa&s;s even of his tran&s;cendent abilities.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is &s;o common a topic of complaint in the&s;e pro|&s;ecutions, that I &s;hould have been &s;urpri&s;ed if it had been omitted to-day, that this is peculiarly and emphatically an age of &s;edition, that the pre&s;s teems with libels calculated to vilify every thing that is great and good, libels de&s;igned to &s;ubvert the foundation of all government, to di&s;&s;olve the bonds of &s;ociety, and to intro|duce confu&s;ion and anarchy. If I had not received the re&s;pectable a&s;&s;urance I have upon this &s;ubject, if I had been left to form my opinion upon what I &s;ee on the record yon have to try. I &s;hould have formed an opinion that the fact was totally different. I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed that libels had become &s;o &s;carce a commodi|ty, that with all the indu&s;try of that numerours herd of Spies, In|formers, and Inqui&s;itors, with which this metropolis now abounds,
<PB N="25" REF="026931_0026_0FD2668527722CD0">none could be found&mdash;not one; and therefore, in onder to keep bu&s;ine&s;s alive, the&s;e ingenious gentlemen had &s;et them&s;elves to work to make one. For if they had not &s;o done, Mr. Eaton would not now he &s;tanding at that bar.</P>
<P>My learned friend has made a liberal u&s;e of that talent which he &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, of working upon your pa&s;&s;ions and upon that of the audience, and in &s;o doing he has acted judiciou&s;ly, be|cau&s;e without captivating your pa&s;&s;ions, he can have no hope of convincing your judgment. But, Gentlemen, &s;u&s;taining the &s;a|cred character you do at this moment &s;u&s;tain, I call upon you to &s;et a guard upon tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which are &s;o liable to &s;eduction, and which, when &s;educed, lead the judgment captive at their will. I call upon you, to apply to the con&s;ideration of this ca&s;e, a judg|ment equally unimpa&s;&s;ioned and unprejudiced. In order that you &s;hould do &s;o, it becomes me now to &s;tate, that the defence of my client does not impo&s;e upon me, as you may have imagined, the nece&s;&s;ity of endeavouring to cool the fervour of your affection for the per&s;on of the king, or to le&s;&s;en your attachment to his govern|ment. If the defence of Mr. Eaton had made it requi&s;ite to avow that a man has a right to call the king an haughty and &s;anguinary tyrant, I &s;hould have told him he mu&s;t have recour&s;e to &s;ome other coun&s;el, for that in the di&s;charge of my duty as an advocate, I could not forget my duty as an Engli&s;hman. No, Gentlemen, I conjure yon with equal earne&s;tne&s;s to that of my learned friend, I wi&s;h I could do it with equal eloquence, to fo&s;ter and cheri&s;h every &s;entiment and every feeling of affection for your king, and in the very fervour of your pa&s;&s;ion I will call upon you, and call upon you with con&s;idence of &s;ucce&s;s, to condemn this indictment, and to acquit this defendant.</P>
<P>But this pro&s;ecution would have been incomplete, it would have been an anomaly in the pro&s;ecutions of the pre&s;ent day, if the af|fairs of France had not been introduced. And why are they in|troduced? Becau&s;e it is &s;uppo&s;ed that you will &s;o far forget your duty and your oaths, as to apply any opinion which you may have formed upon them to the injury of the defendant in this cau&s;e. If con&s;idered rightly, I think the re&s;ult will not be unfavourable to the defendanr. Whatever di&s;orders may have tarni&s;hed the French Revolution, they afford an argument to Engli&s;hmen to prize and maintain every liberty they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and above all the liberty of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>If the French, after having been kept in darkne&s;s for ages, were, when the light fir&s;t beamed upon their a&s;toni&s;hed fight, dazzled with its lu&s;tre, and therefore mi&s;took one object for another, it is not they whom we ought &s;o &s;everely to cen&s;ure, as the dete&s;ted mon&s;ters who had &s;o long veiled their eyes. If after having been
<PB N="26" REF="026931_0027_0FD26686DB3CB7A0">for ages in&s;tructed in le&s;&s;ons of barbarity, from the open and un|authori&s;ed exerci&s;e of which they were re&s;trained, is it &s;o very ex|traordinary that when that re&s;traint was removed, &s;ome of them &s;hould practi&s;e the le&s;&s;ons their former ma&s;ters had taught them? It in their progre&s;s from &s;lavery to freedom they have had to tra|ver&s;e a narrow and a &s;lippery path, a&s;&s;ailed by idea without and by traitors within, is it to be wondered at that many of them &s;hould &s;tumble and &s;hould fall?</P>
<P>But is liberty to be de&s;cried, becau&s;e at any time, or upon any occa&s;ion, licentiou&s;ne&s;s has a&s;&s;umed its name? No: it ought rather to &s;timulate every people who po&s;&s;e&s;s it, to pre&s;erve it in its pri&s;tine purity; above all, it ought to &s;timulate them to the pre|&s;ervation of that part, without which they would &s;ink into a &s;tate of &s;tupid ignorance, and con&s;equently of abject &s;lavery.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in the fulfilment of the &s;olemn and &s;acred duties of jurymen, there are few ca&s;e which have a &s;tronger claim upon your attention than pro&s;ecution for political libel. A pro&s;ecu|tion for a political libel is a charge not of the of a common wrong, but of the abu&s;e of a common right. I do not mean to &s;ay, that the abu&s;e of a common right may not amount to the commi&s;&s;ion of a commonordinary commi&s;&s;ion wrong, but that it is a charge of a different de&s;cription, requiring &s;tonger evidence to &s;upport it, and to be decided by the application of different prin|ciples. The ordinary commi&s;&s;ion of a common wrong, is the doing an act which the law has expre&s;ly forbidden, and for which therefore, when the party does it, he knows he is amenable to the law. The abu&s;e of a common and acknowledged right, may pro|ceed from a mind deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the importance of the right, and eagerly employed in its exerci&s;e, not being &s;ufficiently acquainted with its bounds and limits. If there is any common right, into the abu&s;e of which we &s;hould not enquire with extra|ordinary rigour, it is that right, the exerci&s;e of which is called in que&s;tion this day, not only on account of its infinite moment to the public, but becau&s;e its limits have never yet been a&s;certained with preci&s;ion. So far indeed are they from having heen a&s;cer|tained with preci&s;ion, that no two men, no two lawyers, are agreed upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But, Gentlemen, I have not in this ca&s;e to implore mercy or in|dulgence for exce&s;s. I have only to clain your ju&s;tice. For of all the pro&s;ecutions for libels that ever came into a court of ju&s;tice I will venture to &s;ay this is the mo&s;t extraordinary, I will add it is the mo&s;t alarming. For I have no he&s;itation to a&s;&s;ert, that if it were to &s;ucceed, the freedom of the pre&s;s could not &s;urvive a &s;ingle hour.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="026931_0028_0FD266882795C230">Having &s;tated this propo&s;ition broadly and boldly, I come im|mediately to the proof of it.</P>
<P>The charge contained in this indictment is, that the defendant, <Q>being a malicious, &s;editious, and evil-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;on, and greatly di&s;affected to our lord the king, and to his admini&s;tra|tion of the government of this kingdom, and unlawfully, mali|ciou&s;ly, and &s;editiou&s;ly contriving, devi&s;ing, and Intending to &s;candalize, traduce, and vilify our &s;aid lord the king, and the regal power and office e&s;tabli&s;hed by law within this realm&punc; and to repre&s;ent our &s;aid lord the king as &s;anguinary, tyrannical, oppre&s;&s;ive, cruel, and de&s;potic, and thereby to &s;tir up and excite di&s;contents and &s;editions among&s;t the &s;ubjects of our &s;aid lord the king, and to alienate and withdraw the fidelity, affection, and allegiance of his &s;aid maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects from hit &s;aid ma|je&s;ty's per&s;on and government, unlawfully, maliciou&s;ly, and &s;editiou&s;ly, did publi&s;h a certain printed pamphlet, entitled, PO|LITICS FOR THE PEOPLE, or HOG'S WASH, containing cer|tain &s;candalous, malicious, inflammatory, and &s;editious matters of and concerning our &s;aid lord the king.</Q></P>
<P>My learned friend has animadverted with &s;ome &s;everity upon the title of this pamphlet, "Politics for the People, or Hog's Wa&s;h." The latter part is a play upon a phra&s;e which has been u&s;ed to de&s;cribe the People, not as my learned friend has &s;uppo&s;ed, an incautious expre&s;&s;ion in the heat of parliamentary debate, but an expre&s;&s;ion deliberately and &s;olemnly recorded in a book which has run through ten or twelve editions, and which retains its place in that book to the pre&s;ent hour. Now if the people are the "Swini&s;h Multitude," I do not think Mr. Eaton is de&s;erving of puni&s;hment for &s;upplying them with food adapted to their nature. "Politics for the People." Whom are politics for, but for the people? Are politics for placemen and pen&s;ioners only? Are they only ble&s;&s;ed with under&s;tandings fitted to the inve&s;tigation of this &s;ublime and my&s;terious &s;cience? Or is it not, or at lea&s;t ought it not to be, a &s;ubject within the comprehen&s;ion of every man? But the price is two-pence, <HI>binc illae lachrymae.</HI> If it be a crime to &s;ell a political pamhlet cheap, Mr. Eaton mu&s;t plead guilty to that charge; but &s;o far from confe&s;&s;ing it as a crime, I &s;tate it as a merit, I challenge for him applau&s;e. Political pam|phlets, I think, &s;hould be cheap. I am very &s;ure that public or|der and tranquility will never be maintained &s;o well as when every man reads and under&s;tands political pamphlets; becau&s;e there is no obedience to law &s;o exemplary, there is no attachment to a good co&s;titution &s;o &s;trong, as that which re&s;ults from a knowledge of the rea&s;on and obligation of law, and the true; prin|ciples as well as beneficial effects of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="026931_0029_0FD2668A0E4B06F0">Gentlemen, you perceive that in the paper which this man has publi&s;hed is not a &s;ingle &s;yllable "of and concerning our &s;overeign lord the king;" but that every thing which is &s;aid of this famous game cock is charged by the indictment to have been meant of him, and is in words applied to him in a number of pa|renthe&s;es that you will find in the indictment, which parenthe&s;es we call <HI>inuendos.</HI></P>
<P>Inuendos have in former times gone &s;uch lengths as to draw down &s;ome degree of ridicule upon them, but never before I be|lieve have they gone the length of the inuendos in this indictment. The &s;ole purpo&s;e of an inuendo, is to &s;ix the true meaning. An inuendo is not to be an arbitrary thing at the plea&s;ure of the drawer of an indictment: it mu&s;t be warranted by the context; it mu&s;t be conformable to the &s;en&s;e of the paper: the &s;en&s;e of the paper mu&s;t not be forced or &s;trained; it mu&s;t be the natural, the plain, the obvious, the nece&s;&s;ary &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>This art of drawing indictments, and contriving inuendos, and &s;o manufacturing libels, is indeed a curious art. I do not know, and I really am at a lo&s;s to conjecture, who could have been the drawer of this indictment. From its internal evidence, I am led to &s;uppo&s;e it mu&s;t have been the author of the Arabian Nights Entertainment, or &s;ome per&s;on equally conver&s;ant in the wild and extravagant fictions of the ea&s;t. He mu&s;t have given unbridled and unbounded licence to an imagination the mo&s;t wanton and the mo&s;t heated, before he could have &s;at down to a&s;cribe mean|ings to this paper &s;o foreign and indeed &s;o ridiculous. All of the inuendos, in my opinion, are far from innocent, but one of them contains the mo&s;t &s;editious a&s;&s;ertion I have ever &s;een.</P>
<P>The drawer of this indictment might mu&s;t as well have employed him&s;elf, like Dean Swift's projector, in attempting to extract &s;un|beams from cucumbers, as in attempting to extract &s;edition from this &s;tory of the game cock.</P>
<P>This &s;tory of the game cock appears to have been related at a debating &s;ociety, in an&s;wer to a &s;tory that had been told of a ne|gro &s;lave enduring the tortures of a frying-pan. The &s;tory was aptly introduced to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of the moment, in reply to a preceding &s;peaker. But as the &s;tory of the negro &s;tave did naturally introduce the &s;tory of the game cock, the allu&s;ion to it is not included in this indictment, becau&s;e it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of this indictment to conceal from you the real intention with which the &s;tory was introduced, in order to impo&s;e upon you a belief that it was then told, and afterwards publi&s;hed, with the criminal intentions imputed. With this view the &s;tory of the game cock is not only introduced into the indictment abruptly, but it clo&s;es abruptly too; for it &s;tops &s;hort at that part which applies it to the
<PB N="29" REF="026931_0030_0FD2668CA47826B0">preceding &s;tory of the &s;lave. The&s;e ob&s;ervations will be im|pre&s;&s;ed more forcibly upon your minds, if when you retire to de|liberate on your verdict, you take with you the pamphlet it&s;elf, and compare it with a copy of the indictment.</P>
<P>But, Gentlemen, I do not mean to contend that the author of this &s;tory intended merely to allude to the immediate &s;ubject be|fore him, the tyranny exerci&s;ed on a negro &s;lave. No&mdash;the de|fence of my client calls not on me to attempt to circum&s;cribe, far le&s;s to explain away any meaning which the&s;e words, taken in their utmo&s;t latitude, can imply. I will concede that the mind of the &s;peaker, in adverting to one &s;pecies of tyranny, was naturally, and I maintain laudably led to contemplate tyranny in general, &amp; that this &s;tory which he relates was calculated to expo&s;e the evil con&s;equences of tyranny, and to point out the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of tyrants. And &s;urely Engli&s;hmen mu&s;t have undergone a &s;trange transformation, if they can endure to hear the right of doing this called in que&s;tion. Why do we look back to our ance&s;tors with &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;m and veneration? but becau&s;e in oppo&s;ing tyranny and tyrants they fought, they bled, they conquered. It was their ardent love of liberty, it was their undaunted courage, it was their un&s;haken fortitude, it was their profound wi&s;dom, that combined to rear that grand political fabric, the con&s;titution of our country, which we have been accu&s;tomed to view with equal reverence and delight, upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which we have prided our&s;elves, but which I am &s;ure we &s;hall not tran&s;mit to our po&s;terity, if we &s;uffer the liberty of the pre&s;s, which is its corner-&s;tone, to be rudely torn away; and torn away it will be, if &s;uch pro&s;ecutions as the&s;e can &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>What language do our ance&s;tors hold out to us by Magna Charta, by the Habeas Corpus Act, by the Bill of Rights, and above all by the Revolution, but this, "We have found monar|chy, unlimited and unfettered, incompatible with rational freedom and &s;ocial order; we have therefore pre&s;cribed limits to it, that you our po&s;terity may be free and happy." It is not nece&s;&s;ary for me to go &s;o far back as the Revolution for this language; it has been held in a feebler tone perhaps, certainly with le&s;s effect within the memory of mo&s;t of us. In the year 1782 the Hou&s;e of Com|mons voted "that the influence of the Crown had increa&s;ed, was increa&s;ing and ought to be dimini&s;hed." Whether they followed up that vote with &s;uch re&s;trictions as were requi&s;ite to curtail and check that increa&s;ing influence, is not now a &s;ubject of enquiry. But it affords all I want for my argument, that every complaint of unlimited power, or of limited power tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the limits a&s;&s;igned to it, every detection of the fact, and every expo&s;ure of the con&s;equence, is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution, is
<PB N="30" REF="026931_0031_0FD26690E827CCE8">warranted by precedents the mo&s;t approved, and is allowed by law. It is not merely allowed, it is commanded by a law that is paramount to all human law, the law written by the finger of God on the heart of man.</P>
<P>But why is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that this game cock, who is de|&s;cribed as an haughty and &s;anguinary tyrant, nur&s;ed from his in|fancy in blood and &s;laughter, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily mean the pre&s;ent mild and merciful king of Great Britain? If we &s;urvey the im|men&s;e continent of A&s;ia, nay if we confine our view to the conti|nent of Europe, &s;hall we find no tyrants whom this game cock may be intended to denote? None "fond of foreign wars," if not of "dome&s;tic rebellions?" None who devour "the greater part of the grain &s;cattered" by Providence "for the morning and evening repa&s;t" of their fellow-creatures? None who are always "picking and cuffing" at tho&s;e about them, who have not &s;trength to defend them&s;elves? Shall we find none who have &s;ported with obligations the mo&s;t &s;olemn, who have trampled on rights the mo&s;t &s;acred, who in the pur&s;uit of their fell and foul con&s;piracies again&s;t the peace and happine&s;s of the human race, have di&s;regarded every principle of ju&s;tice, have outraged every feeling of huma|nity, have defied every mandate of their God?</P>
<P>But this &s;peaker &s;ays, he thinks the be&s;t thing one could do for men and women is to rid the world of tyrants. It that &s;o crimi|nal? Then I am criminal; for I think &s;o too. Tyrants, in any form, I believe, are much too bad to be mended, and I think the be&s;t way of di&s;po&s;ing of them is to &s;end them out of a world to which they are a cur&s;e, and which they can benefit only by leav|ing it. If this le&s;&s;on were learned and were practi&s;ed by every people groaning under tyranny, &s;oon would freedom, which is now confined to a narrow &s;pot, diffu&s;e her ble&s;&s;ings through the world.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t political truth that is engraven on the &s;oul of man, is, that all power flows from the people, and is a tru&s;t for their bene|fit, and that when that tru&s;t is abu&s;ed, re&s;i&s;tance is not only a right but a duty. The Revolution of 1688 was a practical e&s;&s;ay upon that principle. Then was that right exerci&s;ed, then was that duty fulfilled. The tru&s;t repo&s;ed in a king was abu&s;ed, the king be|came a tyrant, the people expelled him; and if he had ever dared to return, he would have expiated, and ju&s;tly expiated, his crimes upon the &s;caffold.</P>
<P>But why, I a&s;k again, is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the king of Great Britain is meant by this tyrant of the farm-yard? Is there any thing in the animal &s;elected for this &s;tory being a cock? That will not &s;erve the purpo&s;e of the pro&s;ecution. For never was the king of Great Britain repre&s;ented by the emblem of a cock. The
<PB N="31" REF="026931_0032_0FD26694363142B0">king of Great Britain has always been denoted by a lion, and the king of France by a cock: the rea&s;on of which, I &s;uppo&s;e, was, that <HI>Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">us,</HI> as you well know, is latin for a cock. None of us, I am &s;ure, can have forgot that which we were taught in our youth, that the crowing of the Gallic cock &s;hould be &s;ilenced by the tremendous roaring of the Briti&s;h lion.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, we have ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed the anniver&s;ary of an event to which my learned friend has adverted, I mean the execution of the la&s;t monarch of France. The application of this &s;tory to that tragical event, cannot fail to &s;trike every mind that pau&s;es a mo|ment for reflection; and if the author had a view to any per&s;on in particular, unque&s;tionably it mu&s;t have been to him: and whate|ver you or I may think of that monarch or his fate, we cannot deny to any man the right of thinking or &s;peaking of him and of his fate as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>But if when any man publi&s;hes a paper on tyranny in general, or Louis the &s;ixteenth in particular, he is to be charged by an inu|endo of this &s;ort with meaning king George the third, what will become of the &s;ecurity and peaceful exerci&s;e of the freedom of the, pre&s;s? If when any man becomes obnoxious to the mini&s;try every thing he &s;ays or publi&s;hes is to be thus &s;trained and perverted for the purpo&s;e of mini&s;terial vengeance, who can be &s;ale? It is not book&s;ellers only who are liable to pro&s;ecution for publi&s;hing, any of you who may happen to give a book to one of your children may be pro&s;ecuted, and your children may be dragged into this court to lay you in gaol by their evidence; and this, perhaps, for giving them a book which no di&s;intere&s;ted&punc; no impartial man would conjecture to have any tendency to &s;edition, or even any re|lation to politics.</P>
<P>Upon the principle of this pro&s;ecution, if it has any principle, a book which, I dare &s;ay, once afforded us much plea&s;ure and in|&s;truction, I mean Ae&s;op's Fables, is the mo&s;t &s;editious book that ever was publi&s;hed. Woe to Mr. Eaton, if he has ever &s;old that book; woe to any man that has &s;old it, if he has given offence to the mini&s;ters, or to any of tho&s;e &s;pies and informers who now in|fe&s;t this country as locu&s;ts or the plague do &s;ome other. There is &s;carcely a fable that will not furni&s;h an indictment. One of them occurs to me at this moment: it is the fable of the Ape who was made king. To puni&s;h him for his pre&s;umption in a&s;piring to that character, the fox led him into a trap; and when re|proached by the ape for di&s;loyalty, he went off with a &s;neer, &s;ay|ing, "You a king, and not under&s;tand trap?" Put this fable into an indictment, and call it "a &s;candalous, malicious, inflammatory and &s;editious libel, of and concerning our &s;overeign lord the king;" &s;tate in the inuendoes that the ape is intended to denote our &s;aid
<PB N="32" REF="026931_0033_0FD26695A9812328">lord the king; and that not under&s;tanding trap, means ignorance of the regal functions; and garni&s;h all this with "again&s;t the peace of our &s;aid lord the king, his crown and dignity;" and then you have patched up a mo&s;t notable libel. With this receipt for drawing indictments, I could go through the book, and draw five hundred.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in this way a man may be pro&s;ecuted for publi&s;hing the &s;acred &s;criptures them&s;elves. For wherever mention is made of a wicked king, and mention is made of many wicked kings, an indictment may be drawn, charging it to be a libel upon the king of Great Britain, and by inuendos applying the expre&s;&s;ions to him. But I a&s;k again, what man can be &s;afe, if meanings like the&s;e are to be affixed to every thing he publishes, or every thing he &s;ays?</P>
<P>Let us look at the language of the &s;tory, and &s;ee the meanings which are affixed by the indictment.&mdash;<Q>You mu&s;t know then that I u&s;ed, together with a variety of youthful attachments, to be very fond of birds poultry; and, among other things of this kind, I had a very fine maje&s;tic kind of animal, a game cock (<HI>meaning thereby,</HI> &s;ays the indictment, <HI>to denote and repre|&s;ent our &s;aid lord the king</HI>) an haughty &s;anguinary tyrant, nur&s;ed in blood and &s;laughter from his infancy, fond of foreign wars and dome&s;tic rebellions, into which he would &s;ometimes drive his &s;ubjects by his oppre&s;&s;ive ob&s;tinacy, in hopes that he might increa&s;e his power and glory by their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion. Now this haughty old tyrant&mdash;(<HI>again,</HI> &s;ays the indictment, <HI>meaning our &s;aid lord the king.</HI>)</Q> Never, I believe, &s;ince pro&s;ecutions for libels had exi&s;tence, has &s;uch an indictment, containing &s;uch inuendos as the&s;e, made its appearance in an Engli&s;h court of ju&s;|tice. The only ground on which the&s;e inuendos can be attempted to be &s;upported, is a ground which the pro&s;ecution will not ven|ture to &s;tate, a ground which they cannot &s;tate; namely, that there is &s;o palpable a re&s;emblance of character and conduct in this game cock so our &s;overeign lord the king, that that man mu&s;t be blind who does not &s;ee the real object, and the true appli|cation.</P>
<P>If the inuendos had &s;topped here, I &s;hould have thought this in|dictment by no means an innocent production. But what mu&s;t I think, what mu&s;t you think, when you find an inuendo in terms the mo&s;t unequivocal, charging the king with being a tyrant. <Q>Yet I had even at that time &s;ome lurking principles of aver&s;ion to bare-faced de&s;poti&s;m &s;truggling at my heart, which would &s;ometimes whi&s;per to me that the be&s;t thing one could do either for cocks and hens, or men and women, was to rid the world of tyrants&mdash;<HI>meaning,</HI> the indictment &s;ays, <HI>our &s;aid lord the king,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="026931_0034_0FD266974AF70990">
<HI>among others.</HI></Q>&mdash;Which is the libel now? Not that paper pub|li&s;hed by Mr. Eaton: for if all that is charged could be &s;ub&s;tan|tiated, its guilt would &s;ink into nothing in compari&s;on with the guilt of this indictment, which contains a libel upon record, in a court of ju&s;tice, that will be handed down to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I now come to the clo&s;e of this indictment, and it is a clo&s;e worthy of it. A little detached &s;entence of three lines is logged in to bol&s;ter up this mi&s;erable pro&s;ecution. <Q>Kings are wolf &s;hepherds. Homer &s;tyles them devourers of the people, and they do not appear to have lo&s;t their original ta&s;te.</Q> To the four fir&s;t words of this, "Kings are Wolf Shepherds," the indictment has applied an inuendo, <HI>"meaning, among othters, our &s;overeign lord the king."</HI> Never was a propo&s;ition &s;tated more evidently fal&s;e than that a general remark mu&s;t have an univer&s;al application. If I &s;peak of kings in general, am I to be under|&s;tood to &s;peak of <HI>all</HI> kings? Certainly not. My omitting to &s;ay <HI>al kings,</HI> demon&s;trates that I mean to exclude <HI>&s;ome;</HI> if to exclude any, clearly to exclude tho&s;e to whom the remark is no longer ap|plicable.</P>
<P>The Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia is the &s;hepherde&s;s of a va&s;t flock; but as it was not &s;ufficiently numerous for the exerci&s;e of her boundle&s;s philanthropy, &s;he has lately, by a little gentle compul&s;ion, aug|mented it by a con&s;iderable number of the Poli&s;h breed. She, and our worthy ally the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, have gone hand in hand in this ble&s;&s;ed work of increa&s;ing their flocks. Po&s;&s;ibly neither you nor I &s;hould chu&s;e to call the&s;e two monarchs "Wolf Shepherds;" but I fancy we &s;hould none of us be di&s;po&s;ed to puni&s;h very &s;e|verely the man who did.</P>
<P>All mankind have found by fatal experience that kings are wolf &s;hepherds, if they are &s;uffered to po&s;&s;e&s;s unlimited power; and therefore our ance&s;tors employed them&s;elves very wi&s;ely in fa&s;ten|ing limitations on their power. But it is of kings who&s;e power is not limited that this &s;entence &s;peaks. For it is illu&s;trated by an expre&s;&s;ion of Homer's, "devourers of the people," which applies to kings who&s;e powers are not limited as the powers of the king of Great Britain are. The king of Great Britain &s;u&s;tains a cha|racter totally different from that of any other king, and therefore general ob&s;ervations upon kings never have been, and never can be under&s;tood to apply to him. On the contrary, they nece&s;&s;arily exclude him. It is not long &s;ince &s;uch an application would have been con&s;idered as libellous, and I rely with confidence on the &s;pi|rit and loyalty of Britons for repelling an application &s;o unfounded and a compari&s;on &s;o degrading&mdash;degrading not only to the king, but to the people. For if it were admitted that cur king re&s;embled kings in general, it would be admitted that he was a de&s;pot, from
<PB N="34" REF="026931_0035_0FD26698D37BBB60">which it would follow, as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that the people were &s;laves.</P>
<P>I have be&s;towed &s;ome pains in &s;earching for an indictment like the pre&s;ent, and I can find none even in that &s;ink of iniquity, the collection of indictments in the reign of Charles the &s;econd. I believe neither the records of the Star chamber, nor the annals of Jefferies, will furni&s;h an indictment in which a general reflection upon the nature and tendency of tyranny, or the de&s;ert of tyrants, has been deemed a libel upon the king of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury, In every ca&s;e where a charge is made, that an act has been done which the law forbids, after it has been a&s;certained that the act has been done, and done by the party ac|cu&s;ed, the next que&s;tion is, with what intention he did the act. It is the intention which clothes the act with innocence or guilt. If you try a man for murder, you do not content your&s;elves with a&s;|certaining the fact of the decea&s;ed having been killed, and killed by the pri&s;oner you are trying; but you examine into the cir|cum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, to know the intention with which he killed him. If you find his intention was malicious, you pronounce him guilty of murder; if he was provoked by a certain degree of irrita|tion, you pronounce him guilty of man&s;laughter; but if you find he did it accidentally, or in &s;elf-defence, you pronounce him not guilty. If this be &s;o in a matter of &s;uch deep importance to he public as the lo&s;s of a citizen, and where prima facie &s;o black a crime as murder has been perpetrated, how much more in the ca&s;e of a mi&s;demeanor, a mi&s;behaviour, which is an offence of the mo&s;t trivial nature that the law takes cognizance of? If this be &s;o in a matter where at fir&s;t view the motives are the mo&s;t diabolical that can predominate in the human brea&s;t, how much more in a ca&s;e where the intention is on the fir&s;t blu&s;h indifferent, and where it is always with he&s;itation and doubt that a jury will pronounce it to be criminal? In a ca&s;e where though one may con&s;ider it to be criminal, another will think it innocent, and a third will believe it to be meritorious, according to the different political principles they have embraced, according to the extent and range which in their re&s;pective opinions ought to be allowed to political di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, when you are travelling in this dark and intricate road, you will proceed with the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible circum&s;pection, left you &s;hould be entangled in an inextricable labyrinth.

<P>But if this con&s;truction were not &s;o evidently ridiculous and ab&s;urd, if it were only doubtful, and doubtful in the mind of any one of you, then you are bound to acquit the defendant.

<P>Gentlemen, &s;ome ca&s;es have lately occurred which make it in|cumbent on me to &s;ay a word or two re&s;pecting the verdicts of ju|ries in ca&s;es of libel.</P>
<P>Whenever the exerci&s;e of a right has &s;uffered interruption, its revival is attended with &s;ome inconveniences and &s;ome errors. That has been the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the functions of juries in ca&s;es of libel. The ancient law of libel did not differ from other criminal law, but when the invention of printing had introduced political di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and when &s;editious publications (that is to &s;ay, publica|tions expo&s;ing the corruptions and abu&s;es of government, and the profligacy of mini&s;ters) made their appearance, the controul of the pre&s;s was placed in admirable hands, a licen&s;er, the king's attorney general, and a court of inqui&s;ition called the Star Chamber. The licen&s;er was to &s;tifle in its birth every thing obnoxious to the mi|ni&s;ters. But if any thing happened to e&s;cape his hands, then the attorney-general, by his information <HI>ex officio,</HI> carried the unfor|tunate author or publi&s;her before the board of inqui&s;itors, who never failed to admini&s;ter a &s;entence adapted by its &s;everity to de|ter others from &s;imilar efforts to enlighten the people.</P>
<P>It was in that infernal inqui&s;ition that the purity of the law of libel was debauched. It was there that that mon&s;trous maxim was fir&s;tbroached, that <HI>Truth</HI> could be a fal&s;e, &s;candalous, ma|licious, and &s;editious libel.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="026931_0037_0FD2669AE70AEF20">Thank God, iniquity always defeats it&s;elf. The intolerable oppre&s;&s;ion of this inqui&s;ition brought on its violent, I cannot &s;ay untimely death. But unfortunately &s;ome of its practices &s;urvived it. The attorney-general was allowed &s;till to carry his informa|tions <HI>ex officio</HI> into the court of King's Bench, and the doctrines of the Star Chamber were after a very long interval revived, and con|tinued in exi&s;tence till within the&s;e two years, when they were, I tru&s;t, completely de&s;troyed by that act of parliament, for which we are indebted to the bright ornament of the Engli&s;h bar, and the model of its eloquence&mdash;an act which has a&s;&s;ured and confirmed to every Engli&s;hman the right of being tried by a jury of his equals, when accu&s;ed of having written or publi&s;hed a libel.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, That act of parliament enacts, that a jury may give a verdict "upon the whole matter put in i&s;&s;ue by the indictment," Of what does that "whole matter" con&s;i&s;t? It propo&s;es four que&s;tions to the con&s;ideration of the jury.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion you are a&s;ked is, Did the defendant publi&s;h the pamphlet that has been produced in evidence? If he did not, you mu&s;t acquit him.</P>
<P>Secondly, Is the &s;en&s;e a&s;cribed to the pa&s;&s;age in&s;erted in the in|dictment by the inuendos, the true, the genuine, the nece&s;&s;ary &s;en&s;e? If it is not, you mu&s;t acquit him.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Is the pamphlet, even if that &s;en&s;e be the proper one, a "&s;candalous, malicious, inflammatory, and &s;editious" libel? If it is not, you mu&s;t acquit him.</P>
<P>Fourthly and la&s;tly, Did the defendant publi&s;h the pamphlet with the criminal motives and intentions imputed by this indict|ment? If he did not, even then you mu&s;t acquit him.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, In &s;aying this, I am &s;ure I &s;hall not he contradicted by the bench, that a verdict of <HI>guilty</HI> mu&s;t be compounded of an an&s;wer to each of tho&s;e four que&s;tions in the affirmative, and that if you di&s;believe any one of the imputations, nay if you doubt any one, you are bound to acquit the defendant.</P>
<P>It is the practice that had obtained before the pa&s;&s;ing of the libel bill, that has introduced any confu&s;ion into this plain and &s;imple matter. Juries were directed by the judges to find the defendant guilty, if the fact of publication was proved, and they believed the meaning a&s;&s;igned by the inuendos was correct, and thence juries have erroneou&s;ly thought that if the fact of publication was proved they were bound to find the defendant <HI>guilty of publi&s;hing.</HI> Gentlemen, there is no guilt in publi&s;hing. Merely publishing a paper is in it&s;elf innocent. It is only the bad quality of the paper publi&s;hed, and the evil intention with which it is publi&s;hed, that can make a publication criminal. Therefore it is the duty of a
<PB N="37" REF="026931_0038_0FD2669F1A4B0888">jury, unle&s;s they are clearly convinced, not only of the fact of publication, but of the truth of the inuendos, and of the paper be|ing a libel, and of the intention of the defendant being criminal, to pronounce him <HI>not guilty.</HI></P>
<P>Gentlemen, the&s;e pro&s;ecutions are totally unlike all other pro&s;e|cutions that come before you. All tho&s;e indictments that you have hitherto tried, were preferred for purpo&s;es of public ju&s;tice, to vindicate offended law, and puni&s;h the violation of public order and private property. The&s;e pro&s;ecutions are always brought for|ward to an&s;wer the temporary and intere&s;ted purpo&s;e of the party in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power; and if it &s;hould &s;o happen that that party before it had attained its power had propagated principles to which their pre&s;ent practices are ho&s;tile, the publication of tho&s;e principles is then deemed &s;editious, and the publi&s;hers are pro&s;e|cuted. The pro&s;ecutions of the pre&s;ent day are indeed part of the ways and means of carrying on this di&s;a&s;trous war. They were not opened by the mini&s;ter with his budget, becau&s;e they are means which he has not yet the courage to avow.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand that the rea&s;on why Mr. Eaton is &s;ingled out and pro&s;ecuted with &s;uch unexampled &s;everity, is, that he has commit|ted that &s;in which is not to be forgiven. Convinced by Mr. Pitt's &s;peeches and the Duke of Richmond's letters that the poli|tical &s;alvation of this country depends on a parliamentary reform, he has frankly declared that conviction. That has been caught up by one of the&s;e &s;edition hunters, who are hired to prowl about the &s;treets, who dropped the information into the lion's mouth at the Crown and Anchor.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, we look back to the pro&s;ecutions for &s;edition in the reigns of the Stuarts with dete&s;tation and horror. Are we ab&s;olutely certain that our po&s;terity will look back upon the pro|&s;ecutions of the pre&s;ent day with very favourable &s;entiments? There was then the &s;ame cry of &s;edition, there was then the &s;ame pretence of con&s;piracies and plots, when all the time the &s;edition was the &s;edition of the mini&s;ters again&s;t the people, and the con&s;pi|racies and plots were theirs, to &s;ubvert the con&s;titutional liberty of the country.</P>
<P>Has this prodigious dread of &s;edition &s;lept from the time of Charles the &s;econd until now, and is it to awake preci&s;ely at the pre&s;ent moment? Were libels &s;o abundant then? Have they been &s;o &s;carce from that time to this? and do they now &s;uddenly abound again? No &s;uch thing. Publications reprobating ty|ranny and tyrants, and arraigning the conduct of mini&s;ters, have never failed to i&s;&s;ue from the pre&s;s. But it is not all mini&s;ters who have been troubled with the &s;ame irritability of temper, or been
<PB N="38" REF="026931_0039_0FD266A16E2E1138">haunted with the &s;ame dread of a free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of their merits and demerits.</P>
<P>It is a bad omen when mini&s;ters wi&s;h to &s;top the current of free enquiry. It is a &s;ure &s;ign that their conduct is &s;uch as will not &s;tand the te&s;t of that enquiry. There have been mini&s;ters of this country who have thought a free pre&s;s their be&s;t &s;afeguard, who have &s;eared no libels, becau&s;e their conduct challenged inve&s;tiga|tion, and would pa&s;s the fiery ordeal with honour. If this is no longer the ca&s;e, if the mini&s;ters of the pre&s;ent day dread the con&s;e|quence of a rigid examination and compari&s;on of their profe&s;&s;ions and their actions, if they wi&s;h to &s;hut out the &s;un becau&s;e they cannot bear the light, let them be open and hone&s;t, let them avow their meaning, let them &s;peak out; let them not, becau&s;e the great pillar that &s;upports the Briti&s;h con&s;titution is hateful to them, &s;eek, upon fal&s;e pretences, to level the glorious fabric with the du&s;t.</P>
<P>But I am &s;ure the lofty and intrepid &s;pirit of Britons is not to be &s;ubdued by any &s;uch means. I am &s;ure the means are very ill adapted to the end. Never yet was the frequency of political pub|lications le&s;&s;ened by pro&s;ecution, but on the contrary they have al|ways been increa&s;ed ten-fold.</P>
<P>If the mini&s;ters wi&s;h to extract the &s;ting from the&s;e publications, they &s;hould adopt a &s;y&s;tem exactly the rever&s;e of that which has provoked them. Let them not cheri&s;h every canker that has crept into the con&s;titution, which mars its beauty, and is eating out its vitals. Let them not cling to every corruption and every abu&s;e, as if corruption and abu&s;e were the end and perfection of govern|ment. Let them not pur&s;ue tho&s;e mea&s;ures which induce the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of increa&s;ing that heavy load of taxes which extorts from the poor the &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence that their labour can procure. Above all, let them not pur&s;ue tho&s;e mea&s;ures which deprive the indu&s;trious poor of tho&s;e very means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and throw them upon the benevolence of a generous public for their very bread. If they will avoid &s;plitting upon the&s;e rocks, they will di&s;arm political publications of every thing offen&s;ive, and we &s;hall then hear no more of the prevalence of libels.</P>
<P>But allow me to enquire why pro&s;ecutions are all on one &s;ide, why it is that tho&s;e pamphlets only are pro&s;ecuted as libels which reflect or are &s;uppo&s;ed to reflect upon the regal or ari&s;tocratical branches of the con&s;titution? Does it not hence appear that to pro&s;ecute libels upon the <HI>con&s;titution</HI> is no part of the &s;y&s;tem of admi|ni&s;tration? For if a man will but exalt the regal and ari&s;tocratical parts of the con&s;titution at the expence of the democratical part, he may libel the con&s;titution with impunity. The democratical
<PB N="39" REF="026931_0040_0FD266A271C88990">part of the con&s;titution is not a favourite &s;ufficient, at pre&s;ent, with tho&s;e who have the management of affairs, to induce them to &s;tand forward as it avengers.</P>
<P>The "MAJESTY OF THE PUBLIC"-(Gentlemen, I am not u&s;ing an expre&s;&s;on coined by the republicans and levellers of the day, if any &s;uch there be; I am u&s;ing the expre&s;&s;ion of that great lawyer Mr. Ju&s;tice Black&s;tone, who&s;e authority is con&s;tantly appealed to on the&s;e occa&s;ions by the coun&s;el for the crown)&mdash; "The Maje&s;ty of the Public" may be libelled. "The Maje&s;ty of the Public" has no attorney&mdash;general to file informations ex offi|cio again&s;t the libeller. The &s;acred rights of the people may be in&s;ulted, degraded, and vilified, and no pro&s;ecution is thought of. Yet let but a &s;arca&s;m be thought to fall on the power and autho|rity of kings or nobles, and mini&s;terial vengeance is in&s;tantly hurled at the head of the unfortunate offender.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, are &s;uch pro&s;ecutions as the&s;e for calling tyranny by its name, intended to &s;pread that torpor over the mind which is requi&s;ite to its introduction? Are they de&s;igned "to &s;top the cur|rent of all the pa&s;&s;ioas but fear?" Let us then re&s;olve rather to cea&s;e to live than live in chains.</P>
<P>View in ancient hi&s;tory the glorious effects of freedom. See the heroic actions it in&s;pired. See the con&s;equences in the perfection of every art and &s;cience that could confer dignity on man, or con|tribute to his comfort. Ob&s;erve the dreadful contra&s;t that is now exhibited by tho&s;e countries which have lo&s;t it. Where you &s;aw blooming fields &s;lately edifices, commercial cities, you now &s;ee a de&s;art. Where you &s;aw a people, adorned by every manly and &s;ocial excellence, who&s;e examples we to this day hold up to our youth as objects of admiration and imitation, you now &s;ee a de|generate race of beings, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the form indeed, bat devoid of the principles and feelings of men.</P>
<P>To what is it was owe the unexampled elevation which we have attained, but that tran&s;cendent freedom which has made us the envy and admiration of the world?</P>
<P>What is it that enables North America to proceed with &s;uch gigantic &s;trides to a &s;tate of pro&s;perity at which Europe will &s;oon gaze with wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment, but the invincible energies of freedom? What is it that renders South America &s;uch a dreadful rever&s;e of that happy &s;tate, but the ignorance and con&s;equent &s;la|very in which the people are held by their unfeeling tyrants?</P>
<P>To attack the freedom of the pre&s;s, and I conceive it is attacked mo&s;t violently by this pro&s;ecution, is to aim a fatal &s;troke at li|berty it&s;elf.</P>
<P>And is it now at the clo&s;e of the eighteenth century, in an age
<PB N="40" REF="026931_0041_0FD266A3EAD4C090">which boa&s;ts of being the mo&s;t enlightened the world ever &s;aw, that liberty is to be pro&s;cribed in its mo&s;t favoured re&s;idence? No, Gentlemen, &s;o long as we pre&s;erve tho&s;e bulwarks of our con&s;titu|tion, the <HI>liberty of the pre&s;s,</HI> and <HI>trial by jury,</HI> and juries pre&s;erve their independence, I am &s;ure all the efforts of tyranny to obtain a footing in this i&s;land will prove abortive.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this is not vain and empty declamation. The ex|i&s;tence of every right we po&s;&s;e&s;s depends in the fir&s;t in&s;tance upon the freedom of the pre&s;s. While we po&s;&s;e&s;s that unimpaired, we can never be en&s;laved. If we lo&s;e it we cannot be free. While the pre&s;s, which has been beautifully and emphatically &s;tyled <Q>the eye of the political body,</Q> continues to in&s;pect and watch with di|ligence the admini&s;tration of public affairs, &s;ome hope remains that tho&s;e affairs may be admini&s;tered with &s;ome attention to the public intere&s;t. But if it is de&s;troyed, or con&s;tantly harra&s;&s;ed in the performance of its nece&s;&s;ary functions, we may abandon our|&s;elves to de&s;pondency and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, if you find the defendant guilty, con&s;ider what you determine, under the awful &s;anction of an atte&s;tation of the Su|preme Being. You &s;wear to the truth of every word and &s;yllable in this indictment. You &s;wear that by this game cock, this haughty and &s;anguinary tyrant, nur&s;ed from his infancy in blood and &s;laughter, is meant the king of Great-Britain, and no other. You &s;wear too that that king is a tyrant, for &s;o the indictment charges him to be. You &s;wear that an ob&s;ervation on kings in general mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily include him. Be&s;ides that, you not only &s;wear that you &s;o under&s;tand all this, but that &s;o did the defendant mean.</P>
<P>Can you lay your hands upon your hearts, and &s;wear all this? Can you lie down upon your pillows without feeling thorns in the reflection, that that man who has already been impri&s;oned near three months upon this indictment, is to be impri&s;oned two or three years longer, and his wife and children reduced to beggary and want, becau&s;e you have fancied that a &s;en&s;e prima facie &s;o fo|reign, may po&s;&s;ibly belong to this paper?</P>
<P>Why is it that that in&s;titution, Trial by Jury, has challenged &s;uch univer&s;al admiration? Becau&s;e men are called upon to try others by the &s;ame law by which they may them&s;elves be tried, and therefore it is concluded that no man would be &s;o mad or &s;o wicked as to wre&s;t the law either for acquittal or conviction; be|cau&s;e in the former ca&s;e he would &s;uffer as a member of that poli|tical &s;ociety which cannot exi&s;t if its laws are not inforced; in the latter Ca&s;e he would be expo&s;ed to the hazard of &s;uffering as an in|dividual, and becoming the victim of his own guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="026931_0042_0FD266A5D8754E88">Where that man &s;tands to-day, you your&s;elves may &s;tand to|morrow. For there is not a word you utter which may not be tortured into &s;edition, with as much rea&s;on as the paper now under your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>In pronouncing your verdict upon this ca&s;e, you will recollect that ever-applicable precept of the great Author of our religion&mdash; "Do unto others as you would wi&s;h them to do unto you." Sit|ting in the judgment &s;eat, you will mete out to the defendant the &s;ame mea&s;ure of ju&s;tice which you would think he ought to mete out to you, were you in his &s;ituation and he in yours. If you were &s;tanding at that bar, accu&s;ed of having uttered general ex|pre&s;&s;ions, prompted by the generous feelings of your hearts, in de|te&s;tation of tyranny and tyrants, to which the de&s;potic ingenuity of a Special Pleader had affixed a &s;editious meaning by &s;uch inu|endos as appear upon this indictment, would you not claim as a fir&s;t principle of ju&s;tice that your words &s;hould be taken in the mo&s;t favourable &s;en&s;e, and not be perverted from their primary meaning, for the purpo&s;e of incarcerating you in that &s;trong man|&s;ion?

I claim it of YOU, becau&s;e the verdict mu&s;t be yours, and yours alone, as you will an&s;wer it to your country, to your con&s;ciences, and your God.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have endeavoured to di&s;charge my duty. I fear I have done it feebly and imperfectly.

<HEAD>Mr. RECORDER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS is an indictment again&s;t Daniel I&s;aac Eaton, who is charged with having publi&s;hed this libel. It cannot be nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;tate the charge, you have heard it opened by the learned coun&s;el for the pro&s;ecution, and you have afterwards heard tho&s;e parts which are offen&s;ive, and which charge &s;edition upon the pri|&s;oner, particularly &s;tated and read to you. The pamphlet has been produced, and it will be put into your hands, therefore it would be a mere wa&s;te of time for me to run over the words of the charge, I &s;hall take for granted that you are perfectly ma&s;ters of them; and being &s;o, the fir&s;t part of my duty I conceive to be to &s;tate to you what is the evidence in &s;upport of this pro&s;ecution; and when I have done that, I &s;hall &s;tate more particularly what I conceive to be the gift of the crime.</P>
<P>To prove the publication they only call one witne&s;s. He &s;ays he bought it at the &s;hop which is kept by the defendant in Bi|&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet, on the 18th of November; it is number 8. Upon the cro&s;s-examination, he &s;ays, he is not an informer, but a man who lives by carrying about new&s;papers. This is the whole evi|dence of the publication.</P>
<P>Before I &s;tate to you the que&s;tion of publication, for of that you mu&s;t be &s;atisfied upon the evidence, I will &s;tate what I conceive to be particularly the nature of the crime, the nature of the &s;edition imputed to the pri&s;oner. It is, as charged in the indictment, that of vilifying and traducing the king and the regal office, as e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by law.</P>
<P>Now as to the fir&s;t, traducing the king, the la&s;t count in the in|dictment &s;eems to apply particularly to that: the part I allude to is this&mdash;<Q>Kings are wolf &s;hepherds: Homer &s;tiles them devourers of the people, and they do not appear to have lo&s;t their original ta&s;te.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, as to this part of the que&s;tion, by the con&s;ti|tution of this country, and by the &s;ettled law of this country, to write any thing po&s;itively and decidedly di&s;re&s;pectful, to vilify or traduce, to render ignoble, or di&s;grace in the eyes of the people who are governed, the fir&s;t branch of the legi&s;lature, the king, is by the law of the land an offence, and this is the offence imputed to the pri&s;oner. The fort of &s;edition imputed to him is, that he endeavoured thereby to weaken the hands of government.</P>
<P>You know very well, Gentlemen, that this con&s;titution is formed of King, Lords, and Commons; and it is very nece&s;&s;ary, the law
<PB N="43" REF="026931_0044_0FD266ACF91D9CD0">has con&s;idered it &s;uch, and wi&s;dom and policy require that it &s;hould be &s;o, that every branch of the legi&s;lature &s;hould be held in equal re&s;pect. I have no doubt to &s;tate to you, that in a &s;tate of civil &s;ociety, where there exi&s;ts a government, there mu&s;t be &s;upe|rioriry and inferiority; it is for the advantage and the good of the whole that it &s;hould exi&s;t; and it is for that rea&s;on that the con&s;titution and the law of this country have fortified and given a particular and &s;trong protection to the character which commands as the chief magi&s;trate, and controuls tho&s;e who are governed in this country. I do not enlarge upon this &s;ubject, becau&s;e I am &s;ure the learned advocate for the defendant cannot controvert this; that being &s;o, you will be to judge whether, upon the reading this pamphlet, which you ought to read, in my opinion, with your minds not all heated either with the addre&s;s of the coun&s;el on the part of the pro&s;ecution, or with the addre&s;s of the coun&s;el on the part of the defendant, but you &s;hould read the book preci&s;ely in the way as if you had it in your own private chamber, and wi&s;hed to make your&s;elves completely matters of the whole &s;ubject: &s;ee what the impre&s;&s;ion on your minds is then, and &s;ee whether a per|&s;on u&s;ing the language which is u&s;ed in this &s;econd count, does or does not mean to vilify and traduce that branch of the con&s;titution which the defendant is charged with doing in the indictment.</P>
<P>You are not only to read the pa&s;&s;ages charged to be libellous, but to read the whole pamphlet; and if, upon reading the whole, you can apply this to any thing but the government of this coun|try, and that branch of it named&mdash;to be &s;ure it does not impute any thing to the defendant.</P>
<P>An ob&s;ervation occurred to the coun&s;el for the defendant which he urged with great ingenuity; he thought it his duty to &s;tate to you that this has &s;o general an application that it is not to be ap|plied to the government of this country. Now you &s;hould read a pamphlet of this fort, charged to be a libel, with exactly the &s;ame indifference as you would any other book; then &s;ee how you are to apply that language in the way it is here &s;tated. "The re|flections of a True Briton. Kings are wolf &s;hepherds," and &s;o on. Whether you would not apply them to all kings?</P>
<P>The learned coun&s;el has told you that the word ALL &s;hould have been u&s;ed for you to have put that con&s;truction upon it. Now that is entirely a matter of fact upon which you are to decide; but the ob&s;ervation really &s;trikes me the other way; becau&s;e it &s;trikes me that if a per&s;on u&s;es the general term in that way, and makes no exception, that it is applicable to all per&s;ons of that de&s;cription. It appears therefore to me, and you will judge of that, reading this with the whole of the pamphlet, whether you do not con&s;ider
<PB N="44" REF="026931_0045_0FD266B02C794CB8">this as a direct attack upon one branch of the legi&s;lature, and that the per&s;on who wrote this (I &s;hall come to the publi&s;her by and by) did not thereby mean to &s;ay that kings, this de&s;cription of people, were devourers of the people, and &s;o on;&mdash;whether being in that general way, it is not in the common con&s;truction of lan|guage to be applied to the government of this country? If you think it is, then it is by the law of the land indi&s;putably a libel: and how far the pri&s;oner may be an&s;werable for it, it is for you to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make one more ob&s;ervation to you upon this part of the ca&s;e, that it is your duty certainly to read the whole pamphlet, be|cau&s;e the inuendos, the &s;en&s;e that is imputed to the per&s;on who writes this book, is entirely to be decided by you. So much for that part of the ca&s;e which imputes &s;edition to the government of this country.</P>
<P>It appears to me that &s;edition is imputed in another way, and that is upon the per&s;onal executive power, upon the king him&s;elf. This indictment charges the author of this pamphlet with charg|ing the king of England, among others, with being a tyrant; and after &s;tating that &s;uch a tyrant is guilty of oppre&s;&s;ion by taxation, and &s;o on, he &s;eems to intimate pretty broadly as his opinion, that &s;uch a per&s;on &s;hould &s;uffer death by the guillotine. And he &s;ays afterwards, de&s;cribing all this by the figure of a cock, that &s;uch a per&s;on, when his trappings were &s;tripped off, was found to be rank with the pollution of his luxurious vices, and &s;o on. The &s;econd count only makes a part of the &s;ame charge; it will be for you to con&s;ider, reading the book in an indifferent manner; for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is no evidence given in explanation of the book one way or other; you have nothing but the &s;peeches of the learned coun&s;el upon it. As to what pa&s;&s;es in the world, you are competent and fair judges. Then reading this book, called Politics for the Peo|ple, and the Reflections of a True Briton, and &s;o on, con&s;idering the time when it is publi&s;hed, you will be to decide upon all the ob&s;ervations you have heard on both &s;ides, whether this is fairly or not imputable, as it is charged in this indictment, to the king of this country, and whether the author who wrote it meant to apply it to the king of this country.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to inuendos, it mu&s;t be a fact always for a jury to decide what is the &s;en&s;e and meaning of a libel; for a man in the highe&s;t extravagance of compliment, beyond a doubt may write &s;uch a pamphlet as &s;hall be a gro&s;s libel. A man may u&s;e &s;uch language as in the plain terms of it at fir&s;t may appear to be no libel: but yet, perhaps, by looking into &s;ome other expre&s;&s;ion, or taking the intention of the party in the whole of the book, it
<PB N="45" REF="026931_0046_0FD266B1B00A9198">
will be impo&s;&s;ibie not to &s;ee, that though he u&s;es language that is ironical, yet that you perfectly under&s;tand he means exactly the rever&s;e of what he &s;ays; and if from the whole of the work you can collect, and think your&s;elves bound to collect, reading it fairly, that &s;uch was the intention of the party, that will be a libel.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is in matters of &s;edition as it is in other crimes. Few men are bold and hardy enough to u&s;e language of &s;uch &s;ort as will &s;ubject them to very &s;evere penalties, without &s;ome &s;ort of cover. God forbid that I &s;hould (for it is not my province) im|pute that to the defendant upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion: but it is my duty to &s;tate to you that if a pamphlet is written in that way, you have a right to take off the ma&s;k, if you think it is a ma&s;k; and it is your duty, reading it with indifference and with temper, to &s;ee what the intention is, whatever the veil may be, whatever the cover may be, whether it is under an ape, or whether it is by alle|gory, or a figure; whatever colour or complexion the book may take, it is entirely for you to decide what is the fair meaning of that book, and what is the &s;en&s;e in which the author wrote it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you &s;ee here is a figurative de&s;cription of a cock, and &s;o on; and this is imputed by the indictment to apply to the fovereign of this country, and to impute to him taxation, and other things, as oppre&s;&s;ion; and that he ought to be taken off by the guillotine.</P>
<P>Upon the ob&s;ervations made on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, and con&s;idering that the book is entitled, "Politics for the People," and "The Reflections of a True Briton," you will be to judge whether that is fairly imputable to the &s;overeign of this country; if it is not, certainly it is not a libel; if it is, on the other hand, it is indi&s;putably a libel, and you will find the defendant guilty of that count.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you have heard a great many ob&s;ervations in this ca&s;e re&s;pecting the liberty of the pre&s;s. I am &s;ure I think it my duty to &s;tate, that the liberty of the pre&s;s is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing this country can enjoy: but on the other hand I mu&s;t &s;tate to you that the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;s is the greate&s;t cur&s;e. And I am &s;ure your good &s;en&s;e will teach you this, that if men are permitted to <HI>&s;ay</HI> any thing, they will very &s;oon go the length of <HI>doing</HI> any thing; and where that is the &s;ituation of affairs in any country, there is an end to all government. And therefore you mu&s;t judge in a ca&s;e of this &s;ort of the &s;en&s;e of the libel, of the intention, of the party, and your deci&s;on on this indictment one way or other will not, in my opinion, affect that que&s;tion which has been &s;taced to you of the liberty of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="026931_0047_0FD266B2E5082DC8">This, you &s;ee, is not charged to be a libel upon mini&s;ters, but it is a direct charge, in one part of it, upon one branch of the go|vernment, and in another part of it in an oppre&s;&s;ive exerci&s;e of the duties of that branch of the government; and therefore if it fairly applies to the king of this country, it &s;eems to me very diffi|cult for any jury to &s;ay, that a per&s;on who writes a book with an intention to make a direct attack upon the government, or to charge the executive government of this country with oppre&s;&s;ion, it &s;eems very difficult to &s;ay that that comes within the liberty or the pre&s;s. I conceive the law to be completely otherwi&s;e, and that the executive government of the country is protected by the law, that every individual is protected from &s;uch an attack, and the exe|cutive goverment of a country, the fir&s;t magi&s;trate, a character that &s;tand &s;o high, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;o protected; therefore it comes, and always mu&s;t come to the que&s;ion, whether a direct of|fen&s;ive attack is made upon that government.</P>
<P>If you &s;hal1 be of opinion that this is not written in a mere &s;pe|culative way, but that it is written with the intention charged in the indictment, to render contemptible that character, and to change that character with oppre&s;&s;ion, it &s;eems to me that this is no que&s;|tion of &s;peculation which involves the liberty of the pre&s;s, but it &s;eems to be that &s;ort of que&s;tion which gives the go by to it; and that you mu&s;t be decided entirely in your opinion upon the evi|dence which is before you.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, much has been &s;aid about the cheapne&s;s of the libel; that is out of the que&s;tion; if you &s;hould be &s;atisfied upon the whole that it is a libel applied to the government of this country, it mu&s;t be an aggravation of the offence, but that cannot decide the que&s;tion of libel one way or the other. But then there is ano|ther que&s;tion for your con&s;ideration, and that is the intention of the party. Now you will ob&s;erve the per&s;on before you is the publi&s;her, and not the author of the libel: but as to the qne&s;tion of the &s;edition in the libel, that mu&s;t fir&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed of; and it is my duty to &s;tate to you, that if you &s;hould think this applicable to the government of this country, that then the publi&s;her of it, if it is a libel, is an&s;werable for the con&s;equences of that publication; and it will he very difficult, in my opinion, for you to &s;ay, when once the fact is &s;ettled that the work is libelous, that the per&s;on who &s;ends into the world that &s;ort of publication to di&s;turb the peace of the country, could do it with any very good intention.</P>
<P>The learned coun&s;el for the defendant has told you, that &s;cince the act of parliament has taken place, this is to be decided in the &s;ame way as any other crime, and he has thought fit to put the crime of murder as the example. Now taking that as the exam|ple,
<PB N="47" REF="026931_0048_0FD266B4813F36C0">how would it be? Suppo&s;e a man commits a murder with a very offen&s;ive weapon, I take it to be clear and &s;ettled law that his evil intent will thereby be pre&s;umed; and if the law in the ca&s;e where a murder is committed with a very offen&s;ive weapon, would pre&s;ume that the party u&s;ing it had an intention to do the mi&s;chief, I &s;hould think if a man &s;ends poi&s;on into the world that may do a great deal of mi&s;chief, that a jury would not go any great length in pre&s;uming upon the evidence, unle&s;s he could on nis part &s;hew &s;ome evidence to get rid of the pre&s;umption that he was influenced by that criminal intention which the law pre&s;umes, in that ca&s;e, as it does in the ca&s;e of libel.</P>
<P>It will be for you, therefore, fir&s;t to make up your minds upon this pamphlet, whether it does apply to the king and the govern|ment of this country; and if it does, then the next que&s;tion for you to con&s;ider is, whether the pri&s;oner is the publi&s;her of it. Now as to that, he certainly is an&s;werable in law as the publi&s;her, if it is &s;old in his &s;hop. There has been nothing proved on the part of the pri&s;oner to &s;hew that he is not at all re&s;pon&s;ible for it; and unle&s;s he di&s;proves the fact of publication, it is a publication for which he is bound to an&s;wer; and as to his intention, I &s;hall cer|tainly leave it to you to determine upon the ca&s;e &s;tated by the coun&s;el, if you are &s;atisfied that this is a libellous work, and if you are &s;atisfied that the&s;e inuendos are proper inuendos, and fairly made out, whether you can think a man publi&s;hing &s;uch a pamphlet as this, charged to have, and having in your opinion a &s;editious tendency, does it with &s;uch an innocent intention as the law will &s;upport.</P>
<P>There is one more ob&s;ervation that has been made by the coun|&s;el for the de&s;endant. You have heard a good deal about the Star Chamber, and &s;o on; now I think it is but fair to &s;ay that this has been brought before you by a grand jury. God forbid that you &s;hould decide the que&s;tion again&s;t the pri&s;oner becau&s;e a grand jury has found the bill; but &s;o far as concerns the attorney gene|ral, it is on the part of the public certainly the milde&s;t method of proceeding, becau&s;e it is giving the pri&s;oner the mo&s;t favourable opportunity of being tried by his equals. I cannot, therefore, con|ceive that this pro&s;ecution can in any way be con&s;idered to look at all like any of tho&s;e pro&s;ecutions of which we have heard &s;o much, becau&s;e I think all that is done away by the manner in which the pre&s;ent attorney-general has thought fit to pro&s;ecure this man.</P>
<P>There was another ob&s;ervation made by the coun&s;el for the de|fendant, re&s;pecting the taxes and admini&s;tration, and &s;o on. I can only &s;ay that I think that ob&s;ervation was a little unfortunate, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="48" REF="026931_0049_0FD266B69D57DB28">the whole of the defence &s;eemed to me upon this occa&s;ion in to turn upon this; and it is the &s;tronge&s;t part of the argument which has been put by the coun&s;el for the defendant, that the&s;e inuendos, applying the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages to the king and government of this coun|try, are not fairly applied. Now it &s;eems to me, in &s;uch a de|fence are that, rather an awkward circum&s;tance; and it looks as if the mind, in reading this pamphlet, could not but feel that it is meant to convey &s;entiments unfavourable to the government of this country; and what &s;trengthens that opinion is, that in the &s;ub&s;equent part &s;omething further is &s;tated re&s;pecting tho&s;e taxes mentioned in this very libel.</P>
<P>You have had another ob&s;ervation made with re&s;pect to the &s;tate of this man's family. Now as all that is to be con&s;idered as an attack upon your pa&s;&s;ions, either on one &s;ide or the other, you have too much good &s;en&s;c to attend to it. You are to con&s;ider the &s;ituation of the country at large, the good government of the Country on one hand, and the &s;ituation of the defendant on the other and I have no doubt that you will do ju&s;tice between them both, and that you will not be hurried away by the idea of a fa|mily, or any thing of that &s;ort, which in a criminal ca&s;e can make no con&s;ideration at all. All that the pro&s;ecutor can a&s;k of you, and all that I can a&s;k of you, is this, to read this book as you would read it if you wanted to make your&s;elves matters of it in your own private chambers, &s;ee what the impre&s;&s;ion is on your minds, and if you think the&s;e inuendos are fairly made out, as ap|plied to this pamphlet, they certainly charge the defendant with publi&s;hing a &s;editious libel. You will judge of the whole. If you think him guilty, you will find him &s;o; if you think this is not made out to be applicable to the king and government of this country, you will then acquit him.</P>
