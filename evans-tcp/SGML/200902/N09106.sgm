<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE puzzle' attending di&s;putes on &s;uch kind of &s;ubjects as Mr. EDWARDS's book treats of, is probably the principal rea&s;on why no animadver&s;ions on his di&s;cour&s;e have been yet publi&s;hed. It was pre&s;umed that few who might read it would be&s;tow attention enough to under&s;tand it; and of tho&s;e who &s;hould atten|tively read and under&s;tand it, few would admit its foundation principles. The author of the pre|&s;ent examination is not without apprehen&s;ion, that the rea&s;on, which hath di&s;&s;uaded others, will be thought &s;ufficient to have di&s;&s;uaded him, from &s;uch an undertaking. He acknowledgeth that he was di&s;couraged with <HI>only reading</HI> this elabo|rate and intricate performance &s;ome years &s;ince. Yet from the great reputation of Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> and prevalence of his doctrine, he came to a re|&s;olution of giving this book another and attentive reading: In con&s;equence of which, the following remarks were drawn up 'the motive' of his 'pre&s;ent writing' and publication 'is a per&s;ua&s;ion of the fal&s;hood of' Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s '&s;cheme; and this per&s;ua&s;ion' he 'grants and &s;ees is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI>' he 'cannot help this judgment.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jack&s;on on human liberty, in an&s;wer to Cato's letters.</NOTE> And as he hath no manner of doubt but the foundation princi|ples of the book before him are fal&s;e, &s;o he e&s;teems them of mo&s;t dangerous tendency.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="011623_0004_0F877775DA842988">IN a <HI>&s;peculative</HI> and <HI>metaphy&s;ical</HI> view, the &s;ub|ject hath been largely di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by &s;ome of the able&s;t writers. The reader may be a&s;&s;ured, that as little metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning as po&s;&s;ible is u&s;ed in the following pages. For &s;uch rea&s;oning the author hath neither abilities, inclination or lei&s;ure; be&s;ides that there is no great occa&s;ion, and that he per&s;uades him&s;elf it would not be edifying. His principal aim is to con&s;ider the &s;ubject in a <HI>practical</HI> view. In <HI>this</HI> view of liberty and ne|ce&s;&s;ity there is no puzzle, whatever difficulties at|tend the &s;ubject when con&s;idered ab&s;tractly. The inqui&s;itive may find a full an&s;wer to the principal arguments of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s book, &s;peculatively con&s;idered, in Dr. <HI>Samuel Clark</HI>'s demon&s;trati|on of the being and attributes of GOD, in an&s;wer to <HI>Hobbs, Spinoza,</HI> and their followers; in the &s;ame learned writer's replies to papers from Mr. <HI>Leibnitz,</HI> and remarks on Mr. <HI>Collin</HI>'s book on human liberty; in <HI>Jack&s;on</HI>'s defence of liberty again&s;t <HI>Cato</HI>'s letters, and vindication of the &s;ame &s;ubject in an&s;wer to <HI>Collins.</HI> To whom the author gladly refers, as having &s;aved him a ta&s;k to which he pretends not to be equal. Others might be mentioned, who have an&s;wered &s;imilar arguments two thou&s;and years ago.</P>
<P>AS we are immediately con&s;cious of liberty, as it is a truth of the highe&s;t importance, no embar|ra&s;sments in theory attending the admi&s;&s;ion of it, can oblige us to give it up&mdash;e&s;pecially as the de|nial of it plungeth us into a deeper labyrinth. The human intellect is imperfect; con&s;equently, things may be con&s;i&s;tent though we cannot &s;ee <HI>how.</HI> The principal purpo&s;e metaphy&s;icks can &s;erve on practical &s;ubjects is to ob&s;cure them.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="011623_0005_0F8777779C17CD90">Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> indeed profe&s;&s;eth him&s;elf an ad|vocate for liberty. Had he profe&s;&s;edly denied it, the author would not have engaged in this intri|cate di&s;pute: For he e&s;teems the denial of liberty a like ab&s;urdity and extravagance as the denial of <HI>motion;</HI> or a <HI>material world;</HI> both which have been denied, and the contrary pretended to be demon&s;trated, again&s;t the univer&s;al experience of mankind. Tho&s;e things which no man can deny without impeachment of ab&s;urdity and extrava|gance; it &s;eems ab&s;urd to attempt a formal proof of. Should a man, for example, endeavour to convince one who might require a &s;tring of &s;yl|logi&s;ms to prove, that the &s;un &s;hines in a clear day, at twelve o'clock, he would have a very idle imployment: Let him that que&s;tions it open his eyes, and he cannot want conviction. Let a man look into his own brea&s;t, and he cannot but per|ceive inward freedom&mdash;<HI>Inward freedom</HI>&mdash;For if freedom be not in the <HI>mind,</HI> it is no where. And liberty in the mind implies <HI>&s;elf-determination.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This kind</HI> of liberty our author denies. In this &s;en&s;e of liberty alone hath he any controver&s;y with the writers he oppo&s;eth. His di&s;agreement with Lord <HI>Kaims,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Author of the e&s;&s;ays on the principles of morality and natural religion.</NOTE> is rather in <HI>words</HI> than any thing <HI>real,</HI> notwith&s;tanding what our author hath pub|li&s;hed to &s;creen him&s;elf from the imputation of be|ing in the &s;ame &s;cheme. Their general rea&s;oning is the &s;ame. They rea&s;on on the &s;ame princi|ples, and only differ about the meaning of the word <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> and a few other words and phra&s;es. Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> affirms, that every volition and mo|ral action is determined by a moral nece&s;&s;ity, which is as ab&s;olute as natural; and that moral habits
<PB N="vi" REF="011623_0006_0F8777781F375158">
are owing to <HI>the nature of things.</HI> He allows on|ly of <HI>external</HI> liberty, &s;uch as is the effect of ne|ce&s;&s;ity in the will&mdash;and con&s;tantly denies a power of &s;elf-determination. Lord <HI>Kaims</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> affirm, 'that man hath, in no ca&s;e, a pow|er of &s;elf-determination; but is, in all his actions, determined by a moral nece&s;&s;ity'&mdash;which nece&s;&s;ity they hold to be as real as any other. The only difference is, that Lord <HI>Kaims,</HI> while he allows that GOD has implanted in man's nature an in|vincible feeling of liberty, maintains, that this feeling is <HI>fallacious:</HI> And Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> denies the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of any &s;uch relation as we &s;ignify by the words cau&s;e and effect. But whether liberty, as maintained by Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> be not altogether <HI>hypothetic,</HI> may appear from the following pages. And as to his notion of cau&s;e and of effect, when|ever he u&s;es the former word for any <HI>antecedent,</HI> or the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of an event or thing, and the latter for the <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of another thing (as he tells us he &s;ometimes doth, p. 58.59.) he &s;o far agrees with Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> in <HI>words</HI> as well as <HI>&s;en&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THE author hath only given the outlines of &s;ome (among many other) arguments which oc|cur'd to his mind to evince the a&s;pect Mr. <HI>Ed|wards</HI>'s &s;cheme hath on the moral perfections and government of GOD, and its con&s;equent practical tendency. Had he enlarged on them, it would have lengthened out the en&s;uing exa|mination much beyond what either he or the reader would chu&s;e. The number of pages is now double to what he at fir&s;t de&s;igned. He hopes for the patience and candor of the public, to who&s;e opinion he &s;ubmits the&s;e remarks. If they are ju&s;t, they need no apology; if not, no apology can be of any &s;ervice. If any &s;hould
<PB N="vii" REF="011623_0007_0F8777799BE13118">
&s;uppo&s;e that in one re&s;pect at le&s;t an apology &s;hould be made, viz for undertaking to criticize the writings of &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed an author as Mr. <HI>Edwards;</HI> the an&s;wer is, that if the par|ticular de&s;ign of the propo&s;ed examination is properly pur&s;ued and executed, and that re&s;pect pre&s;erved which is due to the character of a gentleman of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s merit and emi|nence, the author hath not tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed: But of the&s;e he is not <HI>him&s;elf</HI> the proper judge; though he hopes to be acquitted (in the lat|ter of the&s;e re&s;pects e&s;pecially) by every one that is. Whatever reception his performance may meet with, he is con&s;cious of the rectitude of his own intentions.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION, Exhibiting a general view of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s &s;cheme; with the de&s;ign and method propo|&s;ed in the&s;e remarks.</HEAD>
<P>IT is quite be&s;ide the purpo&s;e of the following remarks to enquire, Whether the general &s;cheme of doctrine Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> intended to e&s;tabli&s;h in his enquiry be rational and &s;criptu|ral. It is only the <HI>foundation principle</HI> we aim to con&s;ider: The &s;y&s;tem built hereupon, whether true or fal&s;e, is not, by the generality of Cal|vini&s;tic Divines, made to depend on the <HI>&s;ame</HI> ba&s;is.</P>
<P>THE principal &s;ubject of the book before us is, 'What determines the will?' And through the whole performance great pains is taken to demon&s;trate, that moral nece&s;&s;ity and liberty are convertible terms. The perplexity, confu&s;ion, and uncertainty, which di&s;qui&s;itions of this &s;ort are attended with, is &s;ufficiently known. We &s;hall endeavour to keep out of the clouds as much as the nature of the &s;ubject will admit.</P>
<P>'THE po&s;ition of chief importance,' we are told is, <HI>That the will is nece&s;&s;arily determined by the &s;tronge&s;t motive;</HI> meaning by the &s;tronge&s;t mo|tive 'that, which, in the mind's pre&s;ent view, hath the greate&s;t appearance of good.' 'Every act of the will hath a certain fixed connection herewith, and depends hereupon, as it's cau&s;e&mdash;
<PB N="x" REF="011623_0010_0F8777801EE512A8">
or the ground and rea&s;on of it.' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry part I. &s;ect. 2.</NOTE> In &s;upport of which it is &s;aid, that 'nothing ever comes to pa&s;s without a proportionable cau&s;e&mdash;that the acts of the will, and material things, have a like nece&s;&s;ary dependance on a cau&s;e without them|&s;elves&mdash;that moral cau&s;es may be cau&s;es in as proper a &s;en&s;e as any cau&s;es whatever&mdash;and moral nece&s;&s;ity may be as ab&s;olute as natural.' <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Enquiry p 30, 40, 48, 58, 52, 66, and pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE></P>
<P>INDEED, by the word <HI>cau&s;e</HI> Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> ex|plains him&s;elf to mean, not only 'that which hath a po&s;itive <HI>efficiency,</HI> or influence to <HI>produce</HI> a thing, or bring it to pa&s;s;' but '&s;ometimes any <HI>antecedent,</HI> either natural or moral, po&s;itive or negative, on which an event, either a thing, or the manner and circum&s;tance of a thing, &s;o de|pends, that it is the <HI>ground and rea&s;on,</HI> in whole, or in part, why it is rather than not; or why it is as it is, rather than otherwi&s;e.'<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Enquiry p. 57, 58, 9.</NOTE> At the &s;ame time he a&s;&s;erts, that every act of the will is an 'effect nece&s;&s;arily dependent and con&s;e|quent on a cau&s;e, which he calls an <HI>efficient</HI> cau&s;e; to who&s;e' determination and command volition is as much <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> as the motions of the hands and feet to the volitions which determine and command them&mdash;that the acts of the will are as '<HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> with re&s;pect to the antecedent cau&s;e, ground, or rea&s;on of them.' <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 183, 184.</NOTE> He maintains, upon the whole, an univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;that all beings, all events, the manner and all the cir|cum&s;tances of things are nece&s;&s;arily determined. Yet be profe&s;&s;eth him&s;elf an advocate for liberty, and labours a di&s;tinction between natural and
<PB N="xi" REF="011623_0011_0F87778136FA2478">
moral nece&s;&s;ity, which di&s;tinction he apprehends important&mdash;natural nece&s;&s;ity being incon&s;i&s;tent with prai&s;e or blame, while moral is not. The liberty he admits is, however, merely <HI>external,</HI> and the re&s;ult of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity in the mind.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a general idea of his plan, &s;o far as it will fall under pre&s;ent con&s;ideration. In pur&s;u|ing our remarks on which, we &s;hall,</P>
<P>FIRST, Examine the &s;uppo&s;ed connection of volition with the highe&s;t motive.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The indi&s;&s;oluble connection of moral cau&s;es and effects.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Shew that internal, moral liberty, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from external, or natural be|longs to moral agents: Or admitting Mr. <HI>Ed|wards</HI>'s &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity to be true in <HI>theory,</HI> it is not applicable to <HI>practice.</HI> It is al&s;o pro|po&s;ed to add, in an appendix, a &s;pecimen of coin|cidence between Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and &s;ome cele|brated infidels, antient and modern.</P>
<P>N. B. We have made u&s;e of the <HI>London</HI> edi|tion. Wherever the reader finds particular pages referred to by numerical figures inclo&s;ed in a parenthe&s;is, &s;uch place in Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s enqui|ry is meant, unle&s;s notice is given of our refer|ing to &s;ome other author.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PART I</HI> On the Connection of Volition with the high|e&s;t Motive.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> hath not &s;hewn wherein the <HI>ener|gy</HI> of motive con&s;i&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>THE enquiry in this place is not, Whether the highe&s;t motive hath always a cau&s;al influence on the will? But, admitting this to be the ca&s;e, what it is that <HI>cau&s;eth</HI> any &s;uppo&s;ed mo|tive to <HI>be</HI> highe&s;t in the mind's view? wherein doth its <HI>energy,</HI> or power con&s;i&s;t? In the next &s;ection, we &s;hall examine, whether the will is indeed determined, in every act, by the highe&s;t motive.</P>
<P>WHEN, between two or more objects in the mind's view, one appears mo&s;t agreable; (from whatever cau&s;e,) this appearance is the highe&s;t or &s;tronge&s;t motive, according to our author. Now as there is a manife&s;t difference between an object's <HI>actually appearing</HI> mo&s;t agreable, and the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of this appearance; the proper que&s;tion, in the fir&s;t place, is, What is the ground, rea&s;on, or cau&s;e of the agreable appearance <HI>it&s;elf.</HI> For admitting the &s;tronge&s;t motive to be the more <HI>immediate</HI> cau&s;e of volition, how doth this prove that it is the <HI>original</HI> cau&s;e? <HI>Whence</HI> is it that any propo&s;ed object hath the greate&s;t appearance of good? From what cau&s;e? Hither we mu&s;t <HI>ulti|mately</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="011623_0013_0F8777829AA3FDF8">
recur for the ground of volition; [Po&s;&s;ibly not &s;top here.] Till the an&s;wer to this que&s;tion is found, the original ground of volition is not di&s;|covered. For if every circum&s;tance of things hath an an&s;werable cau&s;e, that there is a cau&s;e why this or that motive is highe&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'In the que&s;tion, <HI>What determines the will?</HI> it is ta|ken for granted, that <HI>&s;omething</HI> determines it. And the controver&s;y on this head is, where the <HI>foundation</HI> of the will's determination is,' (p. 56.) Mr <HI>Edwards</HI> &s;aith expre&s;ly, 'That the act of volition it&s;elf (or the will) is <HI>always</HI> determined by that in the mind's view of an object, which <HI>cau&s;es it to appear</HI> mo&s;t agreable.' (p. 12) Here, then, is the FOUNDATION of the will's determination. Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s bu&s;ine&s;s, there|fore, according to his own &s;tate of the que&s;tion, was, to point out what <HI>cau&s;eth an object to appear</HI> mo&s;t agreable. For if that which CAUSETH <HI>this appear|ance</HI> be the real cau&s;e of volition, then the agreable appearance ITSELF cannot be the cau&s;e. The agre|able appearance, or highe&s;t motive, as he ob&s;erves, is nothing <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> from volition, but the <HI>very thing,</HI> as will be particularly &s;hewn in the next &s;ection. We would here ju&s;t hint, by the way, that Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> hath given ample te&s;timony again&s;t 'the po&s;ition of chief importance in his di&s;cour&s;e.' For that the highe&s;t motive doth not <HI>always</HI> determine volition, is pretty apparent, if it is <HI>always</HI> determined by that in or about an object which <HI>cau&s;eth</HI> it to be, and appear, mo&s;t agreable. The will, in no in&s;tance what&s;oever, is determined by the agreable appearance, but by the cau&s;e of &s;uch appearance.</NOTE></P>
<P>THOUGH Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed the re&s;oluti|on of this que&s;tion was 'not nece&s;&s;ary to his pur|po&s;e,' <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 12.&mdash;16.</NOTE> yet he hath, in &s;everal particulars, re|marked what he apprehended may 'have in|fluence' in <HI>cau&s;ing</HI> 'the objects of volition to ap|pear agreable to the mind.' He a&s;&s;igns, for in|&s;tance,
<PB N="3" REF="011623_0014_0F8777835D785790">
'the apparent nature and circum&s;tances of the object&mdash;the manner of the mind's view of it&mdash;the &s;tate of the mind, by nature or educati|on&mdash;or the frame it is in on a particular occa&s;i|on.'

Now the preferablene&s;s of the object in its own nature, and as appre|hended by rea&s;on, not being always the ground or cau&s;e of its appearing mo&s;t agreable, but &s;omething diver&s;e or contrary, in many in&s;tan|ces; the que&s;tion is, How came beings made upright to mi&s;take their happine&s;s upon the whole? For mi&s;take it they mu&s;t; (by &s;uppo|&s;ition) or otherwi&s;e in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> act of &s;in they could not be determined by the greate&s;t appa|rent good.</P>
<P>HERE we may enquire, Whether <HI>in innocence</HI> any thing but conformity and &s;ubjection to the Creator could appear to be the greate&s;t good? If not, then, on Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s hypothe&s;is, an innocent creature could never rebel. If, on the
<PB N="11" REF="011623_0023_0F877797A42714C8">
other hand, rebellion again&s;t the &s;upreme cau&s;e had the appearance of the greate&s;t good to <HI>Adam</HI> in innocence, and to apo&s;tate angels be|fore their fall, how doth this con&s;i&s;t with the general opinion that hath been entertained of the original extent of their rational faculties, and the &s;piritual image of GOD with which they were endowed? The powers of intellect in innocent <HI>Adam,</HI> for example, have been &s;up|po&s;ed &s;o great, that con&s;i&s;tently herewith it can|not be doubted but he had the fulle&s;t view of duty, and of his highe&s;t intere&s;t as connected with it; and con&s;equently could have no appa|rent &s;uperior motive to tran&s;gre&s;s. If in in|nocence he could not he&s;itate but it was his highe&s;t duty to refrain from the forbidden fruit, he could not, (by &s;uppo&s;ition) he&s;itate but &s;uch act of forbearance was al&s;o his highe&s;t hap|pine&s;s. Therefore the greate&s;t <HI>apparent</HI> good was to retain his integrity. Con&s;equently, in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing, his will was not determined <HI>by,</HI> but <HI>again&s;t,</HI> the highe&s;t motive. Nor can we conceive of a <HI>pre&s;umptuous</HI> &s;inner, on any other &s;uppo&s;ition&mdash;meaning hereby, one who acts again&s;t <HI>pre&s;ent conviction</HI>&mdash;or <HI>directly in oppo&s;ition to the light he hath in the very article of &s;inning.</HI></P>
<P>IT will, perhaps, be &s;aid, that innocent <HI>Adam</HI>'s highe&s;t good was to <HI>forfeit his integrity.</HI> And indeed, on any other hypothe&s;is, the controver|&s;y &s;eems to be brought to an i&s;&s;ue, and the opi|nion of being always nece&s;&s;arily determined by the highe&s;t motive given up. Now &s;hould this be &s;aid, (which is at lea&s;t imply'd, if not expre&s;|&s;ed, in what Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> hath remarked <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part iv. Sect. 9.</NOTE> on

<P>"THAT the will always follows the la&s;t prac|tical judgment of the under&s;tanding, hath pa&s;|&s;ed current as a maxim in the &s;chools: So that if a &s;ick man &s;hall, in contradiction to his phy|&s;ician's judgment, and his own, indulge his ap|petite for meat or drink, he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed previou&s;ly to have convinced him&s;elf, that his pre&s;ent indulgence is of more value to him than his health, or even his life.

Nor will it follow, becau&s;e the percep|tion of the under&s;tanding is denied to be the imme|diate, efficient, nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e of the exertion of the &s;elf- motive power, that therefore <HI>unintelligent matter</HI> may be capable of &s;elf-motion; any more than it will follow, if a man's <HI>eyes</HI> be denied to be the im|mediate, efficient, nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e of his walking, that therefore the man may be capable of walking, though he has neither legs nor life.

<P>HERE it is fully declared, that, 'properly &s;peaking,' volition and the highe&s;t motive are not DISTINCT things&mdash;that the former is only <HI>as</HI> the latter, and not <HI>determined by</HI> it.

<P>'FROM things that have been' remarked, we

think it clearly follows, that Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> hath equally failed in pointing out the more <HI>immedi|ate</HI> cau&s;e of volition, as its <HI>original</HI> cau&s;e. By his own declaration, the will is not determined <HI>by,</HI> but the <HI>&s;ame</HI> thing with, the &s;tronge&s;t mo|tive. He hath only &s;hewn what determines <HI>ex|ternal action or conduct</HI>&mdash;a point very different from the determination of the <HI>will.</HI> And hence (according to Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s own rea&s;oning) the enquiry, 'What determines the will?' is pre|ci&s;ely the &s;ame with this, 'What <HI>cau&s;eth</HI> an ob|ject to appear mo&s;t agreable?' A very different enquiry, &s;urely, from this, Whether volition is <HI>as,</HI> or according to, the agreable appearance of an object? unle&s;s we will confound cau&s;e and effect. The agreable appearance, &s;aith Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> is the mind's preference, choice, or determination. But <HI>antecedent</HI> to the mind's view of the object, there mu&s;t be &s;omething in it [the object] to cau&s;e it to appear agreable when viewed&mdash;&s;omething independent on, and prior to the view&mdash;or the mind mu&s;t be in &s;uch a particular &s;tate, frame, or temper&mdash;or view the object under &s;uch and &s;uch circum&s;tances, in order to it's appearing thus and thus agreable. Now when it can be di&s;tinctly &s;hewn, what <HI>that</HI> is in any object it&s;elf, or in the &s;tate, manner, and circum&s;tances of the mind viewing it, which cau&s;eth <HI>(produceth)</HI> the agreable appearance; then, perhaps, the <HI>determining</HI> cau&s;e of volition may be di&s;covered. That which cau&s;eth the agreable appearance, produceth the highe&s;t mo|tive, that is, volition. Upon Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s own &s;tate of the que&s;tion, there is no making any &s;en&s;e of his words, to &s;ay, that the highe&s;t motive is the cau&s;e, or determiner of volition.

This he hath, in <HI>expre&s;s</HI> terms denied. And yet great part of his book was wrote to prove it. It is the 'po&s;ition of chief importance in his di&s;cour&s;e.'</P>
<P>IT will po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aid, 'There is no need of &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;tronge&s;t motive to be <HI>prior</HI> to, or <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> from, volition; but that the latter is de|termined by the former in the very act of voli|tion'.

<P>FIRST, 'IF the determining act' (the highe&s;t motive) 'be before the determined in order of <HI>na|ture,</HI> being the cau&s;e, ground, or rea&s;on of its exi&s;tence, this as much proves it to be <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> from it, and <HI>independent</HI> on it, as if it were in or|der of <HI>time'.</HI></P>

is, What influenceth, directs, or determines the mind or will to come to &s;uch a choice as it does? or what is the cau&s;e, ground, or rea&s;on, why it concludes thus, and not otherwi&s;e? Now it mu&s;t be an&s;wered, according to, Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s 'no|tion, that the will influences, orders, and deter|mines it&s;elf'. For the will is determined by the &s;tronge&s;t motive, and this is nothing <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> from volition. Now that the &s;tronge&s;t motive 'cau|&s;eth, influenceth, and determineth the will, and yet is not antecedent to it;' nor di&s;tinct from it, 'is a contradiction.' To &s;ay that one 'thing is the cau&s;e or rea&s;on of another, is to &s;ay, that the former is prior to the latter. The cau&s;e is di&s;tinct from the effect, and prior to it. To &s;ay, that the &s;tronge&s;t motive, 'orders, influences, determines the act of volition,' and yet is not 'properly di&s;tinct, is to make the exertion both cau&s;e and effect.

We &s;hall give a few in&s;tances. The term <HI>will</HI> is &s;ome|times u&s;ed for an <HI>ab&s;tract</HI> power, property, or faculty; (p. 38, 39.) Sometimes it is confounded with <HI>mo|tive;</HI> (p. 11, 12.) while at other times, and indeed more generally, it is u&s;ed to denote the <HI>agent</HI>&mdash;As where the will is &s;aid to be <HI>the &s;ubject of commands,</HI> &amp;c &mdash;where the <HI>acts</HI> of the will are &s;poken of&mdash; where motives are repre&s;ented as <HI>influencing</HI> and <HI>deter|mining</HI> it, i. e. the agent. (For motives do not in|fluence meer properties.)</P>
<P>By <HI>motive</HI> (the highe&s;t) he explains him&s;elf to mean the &s;ame as <HI>volition;</HI> (p. 11. 12.) while he al&s;o under&s;tands by it &s;omething <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> &s;tanding in the mind's view, and having a <HI>tendency,</HI> by the ap|pearance it makes, to excite and engage the mind to &s;uch and &s;uch volitions&mdash;i. e. to incline and di&s;po&s;e it to &s;uch and &s;uch a choice. Again, he means by motives, <HI>inclination</HI> or <HI>di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> and expre&s;ly blends 'moral motives and inducements' with <HI>'habits and di&s;po&s;itions</HI> of the heart,' making them the &s;ame. (p. 29, 31.) That is, motives are &s;omething <HI>without</HI> them&s;elves, and have a <HI>tendency</HI> to excite and engage to them&s;elves, and are not <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> from them&s;elves. (p. 8, 9, 11.)</P>
<P>In like manner, while he is taking pains to make out a di&s;tinction between <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> he confounds them&mdash;(at lea&s;t in our apprehen&s;ion, Part I. Sect. 4.)</P>
<P>THE term <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> as it hath been generally u&s;ed, denotes <HI>efficiency,</HI> and has relation to an effect produced&mdash;And Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> him&s;elf &s;ays (after <HI>Spinoza and Hobbs</HI>) 'that if it be not &s;ufficient to produce the effect, or doth not always <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> produce it, there is no &s;uch relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ting as we &s;ignify by the terms cau&s;e and effect. That which &s;eems to be the cau&s;e, can be no cau&s;e.' Yet he tells us, 'that he &s;ometimes u&s;es the word cau&s;e to &s;ignify any <HI>antecedent,</HI> which is perhaps rather an <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> than a cau&s;e of an event or thing; and the word <HI>effect,</HI> for the <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of another thing'. (p. 58, 59, 103.) But who ever &s;up|po&s;ed the meer <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of a thing or event to be the cau&s;e thereof, in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as that the thing or e|vent is <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> dependent on, connected with, and proceeds from the occa&s;ion of it? Our Lord's co|ming was the antecedent and occa&s;ion of di&s;cord and war. Did the&s;e nece&s;&s;arily proceed from his coming? Was there no more in the con&s;equent than in the antecedent? Had Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> u&s;ed the terms occa|&s;ion and con&s;equence, in&s;tead of cau&s;e and effect, in tho&s;e parts of his book, where (by his own acknow|ledgement) the former would have been more pro|per, he might have been better under&s;tood, and would have taken a likelier method to 'cut off occa&s;ion from cavillers and objectors.' (p. 59, 393, 394, mar|gin.)</P>
<P>THE reader will al&s;o take notice of the <HI>promi&s;cuous</HI> u&s;e of the words <HI>cau&s;e, ground, rea&s;on.</HI> So far as an acti|on is conformable to right rea&s;on, &s;o much <HI>rea&s;on</HI> there is for it, and no more.

<P>ALL moral good or evil con&s;i&s;ting in the <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> or <HI>&s;tate</HI> of the <HI>mind</HI> or <HI>will,</HI> it is of &s;mall moment, comparatively, what deter|mines material action.

The que&s;tion, What determineth the motions and actions of the body? is quite <HI>foreign</HI> to the &s;ubject. But as Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> affirms, that the will is the true cau&s;e of external action or con|duct, and makes the whole of liberty to lie here, we will examine this po&s;ition, on his own prin|ciples.</P>
<P>'THE voluntary action, which is the fruit and con&s;equence of volition, is determined by that which appears mo&s;t agreable;' or by the will which 'always is as the greate&s;t apparent good,' and 'not properly di&s;tinct' from it. 'Li|berty is a power, opportunity any one has of doing, or conducting according to his will, be|ing free from external hindrance or compul|&s;ion.&mdash;Or a power of <HI>executing</HI> his will. There are two things that are contrary to liberty.

The other is <HI>re&s;traint;</HI> which is his being hindered, and not having power to do <HI>according</HI> to his

<P>NOW how is it po&s;&s;ible that action and con|duct &s;hould be free, and yet be the effects of a nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e? 'There is not more in the ef|fect than in the cau&s;e.

How is corporeal action determined by the will, when 'the will in no in&s;tance is its own determin|er', con&s;equently not in the particular determi|nation to move the body? At lea&s;t, the will de|termines this no otherwi&s;e than as it is it&s;elf de|termined hereto by an antecedent, nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e. Or how can that be called a voluntary determination, which is the effect of nece&s;&s;ity? or that a voluntary action to which a man is ne|ce&s;&s;arily determined? If the act of the will, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to determine and fix the exter|nal acts of the body, be not it&s;elf free, accord|ing to Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s own rea&s;oning, the acti|ons proceeding herefrom cannot be &s;o. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HAD Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> attended to his <HI>own</HI> rea&s;oning, he would not have affirmed, that external actions might be free, when the will, which determines them, is &s;ubject to nece&s;&s;ity. For, &s;ays he, 'if the <HI>deter|mining</HI> act be nece&s;&s;ary, the man cannot be the &s;ub|ject of command or government in his <HI>external actions;</HI> becau&s;e the&s;e are all nece&s;&s;ary, being the nece&s;&s;ary effects of the acts of the will them&s;elves'.

That we have not a power of election or liberty in the act of volition, at lea&s;t not in the fir&s;t and leading act of choice, which determines all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>IF, therefore, freedom be not <HI>in the will,</HI> we &s;hould be glad to know <HI>where</HI> it is?

In other words, the will is no cau&s;e at all. For a nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e is not pro|perly &s;peaking a cau&s;e; it is nothing di&s;tinct from a meer in&s;trument. A cau&s;e, &s;trictly &s;o called, mu&s;t be <HI>free;</HI> at lea&s;t &s;o far as prai&s;e or blame, reward or puni&s;hment, belong to it.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, external actions mu&s;t ulti|mately be determined, not by the will, but by that cau&s;e which determineth the will, agreable to our author's own principles. The will being in no in&s;tance it's own determiner, there is in no in&s;tance a power or capacity of choice in man|kind. For choice is the &s;ame as the will's deter|mination: A power or capacity of choice, there|fore, would be a power of &s;elf-determination, which Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s whole &s;cheme is de&s;igned to &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of.</P>
<P>THE &s;um of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s &s;cheme appears to be this. Liberty con&s;i&s;ts in a man's power to

<HI>execute</HI> his will&mdash;to <HI>do</HI> or <HI>conduct</HI> according to what is willed. His will <HI>is</HI> (not <HI>determined by,</HI> but is) the greate&s;t apparent good. And yet every volition is the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>effect</HI> of the greate&s;t apparent good, <HI>produced and determined</HI> by it as the <HI>efficient</HI> cau&s;e&mdash;which cau&s;e, however, is nothing di&s;tinct from the effect produced. From what particular cau&s;e any object comes to have the greate&s;t appearance of good is yet a &s;e|cret, of no u&s;e to be known to nine hundred and ninety nine out a thou&s;and of mankind For the &s;atisfaction of the thou&s;andth per&s;on, Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> has laboured to explore this &s;ecret; and yet his 'having failed here doth not overthrow the po|&s;ition, which was the thing of chief importance in his di&s;cour&s;e;' for it only remains to be&mdash; explained and proved. Antecedent nece&s;&s;ity de|termines the will; this determines corporeal acti|ons; and action is voluntary; i. e. is willed, or cau&s;ed to be willed&mdash;there is no <HI>outward compul|&s;ion</HI> or re&s;traint in the ca&s;e, but <HI>only</HI> a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary in|ward determination.</HI> Liberty is indeed nece&s;&s;ary to prai&s;e or blame.

<P>Now though we would not chu&s;e to di&s;&s;ent from &s;uch a ma&s;ter of rea&s;on, yet the enquiry in a manner for|ceth it&s;elf upon us, Where is the propriety of &s;up|po&s;ing any thing, in any &s;en&s;e, to be the PRIOR ground of the exi&s;tence of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> cau&s;e? Doth not this convey the idea of an <HI>effect produced?</HI> The Dr. remarks on <HI>Spinoza's</HI> doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity, (or 'the nece&s;&s;ary following of an effect from it's cau&s;e') that 'this nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t &s;till be determined by &s;omething <HI>antecedent,</HI> and <HI>&s;o on infinitely.'</HI> Might not a Spinozi&s;t reply, that <HI>that</HI> nece&s;&s;ity, which Dr. <HI>Clark</HI> faith is the cau&s;e of the exi&s;tence of GOD mu&s;t be determined by &s;omething antecedent? and &s;o on'?</P>
<P>The Dr. takes his ri&s;e to the nece&s;&s;ity of the divine exi&s;tence from hence, That 'there hath exi&s;ted from eternity &s;ome one independent being, the author of all other beings.' (vid. p. 8,&mdash;15. Edit. 10th.) On this <HI>po&s;tulatum</HI> he proceeds. Hence, and from things &s;aid in his &s;eventh letter, it is probable he re|ally meant not to prove the <HI>certain exi&s;tence</HI> of GOD <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> but his particular <HI>perfections.</HI> 'The infini|ty, eternity, unity of GOD, &amp;c mu&s;t be demon&s;tra|ted from the nature of nece&s;&s;ary exi&s;tence; from the nature and con&s;equences of that nece&s;&s;ity, by which the fir&s;t cau&s;e exi&s;ts' And yet, &s;peaking of the '&s;chola&s;tic way of proving the EXISTENCE of the &s;elf-exi&s;tent being, from the ab&s;olute perfection of his na|ture,' the Dr. remarks, 'All or any perfections <HI>pre|&s;uppo&s;e</HI> exi&s;tence; which is <HI>petitio principii.</HI> But bare nece&s;&s;ity of exi&s;tence doth not <HI>pre&s;uppo&s;e,</HI> but <HI>infer</HI> exi&s;tence. In this ca&s;e, here mu&s;t <HI>nothing be pre&s;up|po&s;ed, no nature what&s;oever,'</HI> (Letter 6th, p. 490, 491.)</P>
<P>WHY then did the Dr. lay down his two fir&s;t propo&s;itions (p. 8, 11.) as the <HI>media</HI> of proof? If nece&s;&s;ity 'doth not <HI>pre&s;uppo&s;e,</HI> but <HI>infer</HI> exi&s;tence; yet the <HI>method</HI> the Dr. takes to prove this nece&s;&s;ity PRESUPPOSES a na|ture and exi&s;tence: it &s;uppo&s;eth that there <HI>exi&s;ts</HI> an eternal, independent being&mdash;the author of all other beings. The very thing to be proved.</P>
<P>ADMITTING the Dr's po&s;ition, that nece&s;&s;ity is the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of the divine exi&s;tence; to what purpo&s;e is it with an athei&s;t? It takes for granted the thing in que&s;tion. The enquiry is not, <HI>How</HI> GOD exi&s;ts? but, <HI>Whether</HI> he exi&s;ts? Exi&s;tence, and the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of exi&s;tence, are very di&s;tinct. An enquiry about the latter plainly pre&s;uppo&s;eth the former. So that while the Dr. endeavours to prove, that GOD exi&s;ts 'from a cau&s;e within him&s;elf,' he takes for granted, that <HI>there is a GOD;</HI> and only accounts for a peculiar <HI>circum&s;tance,</HI> or this <HI>mode</HI> of his exi&s;tence, that it is 'by a nece&s;&s;ity of nature.' Whereas the &s;ubject of enquiry between an athei&s;t and a thei&s;t is not the <HI>modus</HI> of exi&s;tence, but the &s;imple truth or <HI>fact</HI>&mdash;is there in <HI>reality</HI> 'an eternal, independent being, the author of all other beings? Now from what can this point po&s;&s;ibly be argued but from the <HI>phaenomena of nature?</HI> If, from &s;urveying vi&s;ible creation, the athei&s;t is not convinced that GOD IS, how can we go a &s;tep farther with him? Mu&s;t he not think it imper|tinent, and <HI>petitio principii,</HI> if we undertake to &s;hew him,&mdash;HOW GOD exi&s;ts? Or to a&s;&s;ign a <HI>ground</HI> and <HI>rea&s;on</HI> of an exi&s;tence, which he believes nothing of? But if from the frame of nature he is convinced of the <HI>certain exi&s;tence</HI> of GOD, he is no longer an athei&s;t, and therefore needs not the argument <HI>&agrave; priori</HI> for his conviction.</P>
<P>Or &s;uppo&s;e the athei&s;t, for argument's &s;ake, to admit that GOD is, but demands to have the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> or <HI>ground</HI> of his exi&s;tence a&s;&s;ign'd and explained. Is any thei&s;t holden to &s;hew him, <HI>how</HI> the divine being exi&s;ted from eternity? Can this be done? Hath Dr. <HI>Clark</HI> attempted it? In one word, are the phaenomena of nature &s;ufficient to prove the being and perfections of GOD? If they are; what need of any other ar|gument than that <HI>&aacute; po&s;teriori?</HI> If they are not, it is certain the argument <HI>&aacute; priori</HI> can produce no con|viction: For this re&s;olves it&s;elf into the argument <HI>&aacute; po&s;teriori.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the being of a GOD is indeed nece&s;&s;ary, eve|ry thing round us declares. If the things that are &s;een were <HI>created and made,</HI> the &s;elf-exi&s;tence and eternity of the creator is proved beyond doubt. For whatever hath a <HI>beginning</HI> exi&s;ts from &s;ome cau&s;e <HI>without</HI> it&s;elf. Now as this cannot be &s;aid of the <HI>creator</HI> of all things and beings, it follows, that he mu&s;t be <HI>&s;elf-exi&s;tent and eternal.</HI></P>
<P>THE Dr. tells us, that 'the <HI>eternity</HI> of GOD' (either <HI>&aacute; parte ante,</HI> or <HI>&aacute; parte po&s;t)</HI> 'can no otherwi&s;e be pro|ved than by the argument <HI>&agrave; priori.'</HI> But, admitting <HI>an author of nature,</HI> doth it not follow, that he ex|i&s;ted, not meerly from the beginning of the phaeno|mena of nature, but from <HI>everla&s;ting?</HI> and being in|dependent, mu&s;t always continue to exi&s;t? Do not the&s;e things follow, without con&s;idering the 'intrin|&s;ic nature of <HI>nece&s;&s;ary exi&s;tence'?</HI> (which is allowed to be <HI>inexplicable.</HI>) Do not they follow from this &s;imple con&s;ideration, that the original cau&s;e exi&s;ts from no <HI>external</HI> cau&s;e? St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;uppo&s;eth the <HI>eternity</HI> of GOD is no le&s;s evident from the things that are made, than his exi&s;tence, power, and god|head. <HI>The invi&s;ible things of him, from the creation of the world, are</HI> CLEARLY <HI>&s;een, being under&s;tood by the the things that are made,</HI> EVEN HIS ETERNAL POWER AND GODHEAD; &s;o that they are <HI>without excu&s;e,</HI> who will not admit this proof.</P>
<P>THE Dr. ob&s;erves upon the whole, that 'the proof <HI>&agrave; priori</HI> is capable of being under&s;tood only by a <HI>few attentive minds;</HI> becau&s;e it is of u&s;e only again&s;t <HI>learned and metaphy&s;ical difficulties</HI>'&mdash;while the proof <HI>&aacute; po&s;teriori</HI> is level to <HI>all</HI> men's capacities'&mdash;that this, therefore, 'is by far the <HI>mo&s;t generally</HI> u&s;eful argu|ment, and what GOD expects moral agents &s;hould be <HI>determined by'</HI> But if the eternity and immortality of GOD cannot be proved <HI>&agrave; po&s;teriori,</HI> how is this argument &s;ufficient with <HI>common people?</HI> Do not they need an argument to prove that GOD is eternal and immortal as well as <HI>philo&s;ophers?</HI> Are the generali|ty incapable of receiving any proof of this point? Or is it the privilege of the learned, that 'GOD, as moral governor,' does not 'expect they &s;hould be de|termined by' that evidence, whereby '<HI>moral agents</HI> &s;hould be determined'?</P>
<P>WHAT the Dr. &s;ays concerning the <HI>unity</HI> and <HI>infinity</HI> of GOD, that they are proveable only <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> we think liable to much the &s;ame exceptions. Meta|phy&s;ical rea&s;oning on this &s;ubject, as well as <HI>&s;ome other</HI> points of theology, in&s;tead of relieving any phi|lo&s;ophic difficulty, hath, on the contrary, given great advantage to infidelity.</P></NOTE> Whence it follows,</P>

<P>MR. <HI>Edwards</HI> would have his readers 'ob|&s;erve, that when he &s;peaks of <HI>connection of cau&s;es and effects,</HI> he hath re&s;pect to <HI>moral</HI> cau&s;es, as well as tho&s;e that are called <HI>natural</HI> in di&s;tinction from them&mdash;that the acts of the will may be as <HI>certainly and indi&s;&s;olubly</HI> connected with the moral cau&s;e, as natural effects with their natural cau&s;es&mdash;that the connection is as <HI>&s;ure and perfect</HI> between moral cau&s;es and effects, as natural; that moral nece&s;&s;ity may be as <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> as natural nece&s;&s;ity.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part I. Sect. 4. p. 30, 31, 32.</NOTE> Yea, he adverti&s;eth us, that 'where he u&s;eth this di&s;tinction of moral and natural ne|ce&s;&s;ity, he would not be under&s;tood to &s;uppo&s;e, that if any thing comes to pa&s;s by the former kind of nece&s;&s;ity, <HI>the nature of things</HI> is not con|cerned in it, as well as in the latter. I do not mean to determine, that when a moral motive is &s;o &s;trong, that the act of the will infallibly fol|lows, this is not owing to the nature of things.

So that, upon the whole, much the &s;ame rules are &s;uppo&s;ed to take place in the moral world, in GOD's government of

moral agents <HI>(&s;o called)</HI> as in the adju&s;tment and di&s;po&s;al of natural things. What Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> intended by a <HI>moral</HI> cau&s;e, we cannot &s;atisfy our|&s;elves. Sometimes he appears to rea&s;on as if he &s;uppo&s;ed there was <HI>really no di&s;tinction</HI> between a moral and natural cau&s;e, (31, 32.) or none to be perceived; while more generally he &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e a di&s;tinction of great importance; which, however, he hath not &s;o clearly pointed out as were to be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>INDEED, if there be not a real and important di&s;tinction between moral cau&s;es and natural, it plainly follows, that Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> hath taken pains to no purpo&s;e to &s;hew, that natural nece&s;&s;i|ty wholly precludes from prai&s;e or blame, while moral nece&s;&s;ity doth not at all. And if there be a real and important di&s;tinction, it is of impor|tance that it be clearly &s;een.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ection la&s;t referred to, Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> &s;ugge&s;ts, that 'when we &s;peak of choice as <HI>di&s;|tinct</HI> from nature, it is without <HI>reflection and re&s;earch;</HI> names being given to things according to what is mo&s;t <HI>obvious.</HI> But though the de|pendance and connection between acts of volition or choice, and their cau&s;es, according to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h|ed laws,</HI> is not &s;o &s;en&s;ible and obvious, as that e&s;tabli&s;hed law and order which is &s;een in the ma|terial world; and though men make a di&s;tincti|on between nature and choice <HI>as if they were</HI> compleatly and univer&s;ally di&s;tinct; yet choice ari&s;es from nature as truly as other events How|ever, the&s;e are the names that the&s;e two kinds of nece&s;&s;ity have u&s;ually been called by; (viz. natu|ral and moral) and they mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome names or other; for there is a di&s;tinction

or difference between them, that is very impor|tant in it's con&s;equences: Which difference does not lie &s;o much in the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>connection,</HI> as in the two <HI>terms connected.'</HI> The difference is <HI>important,</HI> but not <HI>&s;en&s;ible and obvious.</HI> 'The cau&s;e, with which the effect is connected, is of a particular kind, viz of a <HI>moral</HI> nature&mdash;the effect al&s;o is of a particular kind, being of a moral nature.' But are we not told in this &s;ame place, that the effect is al&s;o connected with the <HI>natural</HI> cau&s;e, and is owing to the nature of things? There is the <HI>joint</HI> influence of moral and natu|ral nece&s;&s;ity in moral events&mdash;their influence is clo&s;ely linked together. Now till the <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> of influence to be a&s;cribed to <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity is di&s;|tinctly apprehended, it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell when, and how far, a per&s;on is rewardable or puni&s;ha|ble&mdash;natural nece&s;&s;ity (by &s;uppo&s;ition) being in|con&s;i&s;tent with reward or puni&s;hment. But let any one examine Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s book, and &s;ay, whether he hath &s;hewn when and how far the acts of the will proceed from natural nece&s;&s;ity, and when, or how far from moral. Whether the &s;o much labour'd di&s;tinction, or difference between natural and moral cau&s;es is not con|founded and exploded?</P>
<P>IT is difficult to determine whether Mr. <HI>Ed|wards</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed the acts of the will to be the ne|ce&s;&s;ary effects of an <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e, or an <HI>extrin&s;ic.</HI> The&s;e are u&s;ed &s;o promi&s;cuou&s;ly and indetermi|nately through his book, volition being &s;ome|times a&s;cribed to the one, &s;ometimes to the other, that, though they are e&s;&s;entially different and op|po&s;ite, it is hard to &s;ay which he more e&s;pecially intended by that moral nece&s;&s;ity, to which he every where &s;uppo&s;eth the will is &s;ubject.

internal, original bias, or &s;omething extrin&s;ic, is the cau&s;e, to who&s;e efficiency, determination, command, deci&s;ion, the will is as much &s;ubject, as the motion of the body to the will&mdash;this being 'as <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> and nece&s;&s;ary with re&s;pect to the an|tecedent determining cau&s;e of it,' as the motions of the hands and feet with re&s;pect to the deter|mination of the will.

<P>WE rather think it was Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s opinion, that the will is determined by an <HI>extrin|&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e. But &s;ince this is by no means certain from his book&mdash;&s;ince he hath not expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf clearly, or we are incapable judges of this intricate &s;ubject, we &s;hall take liberty to examine his doctrine on both &s;uppo&s;itions&mdash;either of an <HI>extrin&s;ic,</HI> or <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e.

<P>WHETHER volition is nece&s;&s;arily determined by an <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e?

<P>FOR 'there cannot be more in the effect than in the cau&s;e.' (62.) Volition therefore cannot be virtuous or vicious farther than it's cau&s;e is &s;o. We may not detach the nature of effects from the efficient. 'It may be wickedne&s;s in the cau&s;e, that it produceth wickedne&s;s.' Suppo|&s;ing then, that 'the wicked act of the cau&s;e in producing wickedne&s;s, is <HI>one</HI> wickedne&s;s; and the wickedne&s;s produced another'&mdash;what follows is, that in every &s;inful volition there are <HI>two</HI> wickedne&s;&s;es&mdash;one chargeable to the cau&s;e, the other to the &s;ubject of the volition. Now if the cau&s;e be 'diver&s;e from the &s;ubject of' volition, how doth it relieve the difficulty at all, if upon the &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ary connection, GOD &s;tands chargeable with doing wickedly? And is not this the plain con&s;equence of the doctrine, 'that the acts of the will are indi&s;&s;olubly connected with a cau&s;e that is nece&s;&s;ary in it's own na|ture'? And if it will be allowed, that GOD can do wickedly con&s;idered as the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of &s;inful volitions, we may ju&s;t as well a&s;cribe all moral evil to him.</P>

<P>HOWEVER repugnant this hypothe&s;is is to that already examined, yet it is frequent|ly made in Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s book. Our bu&s;i|ne&s;s is not to reconcile him with him&s;elf, But to remark on what we find. His meaning would doubtle&s;s have been clearer, had the &s;ubject he undertook been intelligible. He appears to have been bewildered at times in his own &s;ubtilty.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay, that the acts of the will are nece&s;&s;ary from internal, original bias, is not very con&s;i&s;tent with &s;aying, they are the nece&s;&s;ary effects of an extrin|&s;ic cau&s;e. For what is this but &s;aying, they are nece&s;&s;ary in their <HI>own nature?</HI> therefore not ne|ce&s;&s;ary by a nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;equence? Yet Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erts, that every thing which ever had, or will have a <HI>beginning,</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary only by a nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;equence. Now if the acts of the will are effects of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e <HI>on|ly,</HI> then they cannot be the effects of an intrin|&s;ic cau&s;e <HI>al&s;o.</HI> But <HI>original bias and inclination</HI> is intrin&s;ic. If this therefore nece&s;&s;arily determi|neth volition, then the other po&s;ition of it's pro|ceeding from an extrin&s;ic, con&s;equential nece&s;&s;ity, (an eternal, nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e) mu&s;t be given up. For 'how can the&s;e things hang together'? Or will any &s;uppo&s;e, that Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> when he faith, 'the &s;tate or act of the will is from the

Such a &s;up|po&s;ition, we cannot believe any one will make, however nece&s;&s;ary to reconcile Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> to him&s;elf. This is a &s;en&s;e of GOD's <HI>working in men to will, and to do; of our living, moving, and having our being</HI> in him, which we pre&s;ume none will e&s;pou&s;e.

<P>'MORAL nece&s;&s;ity,' &s;aith Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> 'lies <HI>in</HI> the will, and is the will's <HI>propen&s;ity'.</HI> How then does it lie in &s;omething exhibited to the mind from without, which is <HI>prior</HI> to the will, and gives it a nece&s;&s;ary determination? Surely the will's propen&s;ity is not prior to its propen&s;ity. No|thing <HI>in the will it&s;elf</HI> can be the moral nece&s;&s;ity by which it is determined, if this nece&s;&s;ity be re|ally <HI>prior</HI> to will. Be&s;ides, to be determined by a cau&s;e in it&s;elf, is to be <HI>&s;elf determined,</HI> if words have any meaning. And moreover, this is making the will nece&s;&s;ary in it's <HI>own nature.</HI> Both which are contrary to &s;uppo&s;ition. What confounding again of cau&s;e and effect! Volition is the antecedent, nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e of volition!

<P>THERE &s;eems, indeed, to be &s;ome difficulty, in regard to the principle implanted in the <HI>rege|nerate</HI> by the Spirit of GOD, upon this hypothe|&s;is of Mr. <HI>Edwards.</HI> For he, we pre&s;ume, would not deny, that they were born in &s;in; and that the bias in regeneration is <HI>changed</HI> from what it was by <HI>nature.</HI> Con&s;equently, the holine&s;s and per&s;everance of the &s;aints is not nece&s;&s;ary from native, original propen&s;ity, but from &s;ome other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may be &s;aid in regard to the in|ability of <HI>fallen</HI> man; Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s principle hath equal re&s;pect to the moral power of man in <HI>innocence,</HI> and of the rebel angels before their fall. <HI>Their</HI> original bias and inclination, it will be allowed, proceeded immediately from the crea|tor.

If then their &s;in was the effect of a nece&s;&s;i|ty originally in their will, or was their will's ori|ginal propen&s;ity, it was &s;o entirely owing to the <HI>nature of things,</HI> that (by &s;uppo&s;ition) it could not involve them in guilt&mdash;Or if connected with the eternal cau&s;e, who alone is nece&s;&s;ary in his own nature, it could not upon our author's own &s;cheme; be <HI>their</HI> &s;in. The whole guilt, if any, mu&s;t be imputed to the fir&s;t cau&s;e. For the fir&s;t &s;in, of angels and man, was once future; and therefore could not be nece&s;&s;ary in it&s;elf, but only by the afore&s;aid nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;equence. (p. 25.) And then, whatever moral impotency now cleaves to mankind, or damned &s;pirits, this being connected with the fir&s;t &s;in, which was connected with the original, nece&s;&s;ary bias of in|nocence; it follows, that the &s;ins of fallen crea|tures are nece&s;&s;ary in the &s;ame way that the fir&s;t &s;inful volition was&mdash;the only way in which all things and events what&s;oever, which are not eter|nal, are, or can be nece&s;&s;ary. They do not therefore partake of the e&s;&s;ence of &s;in; or if they do, involve the creator in it.</P>
<P>INDEED the &s;uppo&s;ition of being nece&s;&s;arily de|termined by original, internal bias, does, upon the whole, lead to much the &s;ame con&s;equences with that of &s;uppo&s;ing the acts of the will to be nece&s;&s;ary by a nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;equence&mdash;&s;ince, agreable to the &s;econd preliminary propo&s;ition, <HI>original</HI> bias mu&s;t be ultimately a&s;cribed to the original cau&s;e of all things. What is natural is the con&s;titution of the author of nature. Mo|ral events, Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> in&s;tructs us, are ow|ing, partly at lea&s;t, to the nature of things&mdash;pro|ceed, at lea&s;t in part, from natural cau&s;es. Now, by his own principles, &s;o far as the nature of
<PB N="55" REF="011623_0067_0F8777D0308737C0">
things operates to their production, neither good nor ill de&s;ert is applicable to the &s;ubject of voli|tion. Had he told us in what re&s;pects, and how far, volition is owing to natural nece&s;&s;ity, we might have known wherein, and how far, the creature is accountable. For herein, and &s;o far, Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> grants, it [volition] is not pro|perly his own act&mdash;he is not the proper &s;ubject of command, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IF volition be partly owing to natural cau&s;es, and the &s;ubject &s;o far is not an&s;werable; what is this but charging the moral turpi|tude of a &s;inful volition on GOD, <HI>&s;o far as it is the effect of natural nece&s;&s;ity?</HI> Now as well may we attribute the <HI>whole</HI> moral turpi|tude to God, as the <HI>lea&s;t mea&s;ure</HI> of it.</P>
<P>IT moreover follows, that the holine&s;s of the angels, who never &s;inned, being among tho&s;e moral events which are owing to the nature of things, is no holine&s;s; unworthy of prai&s;e. The &s;ame thing follows with re&s;pect &s;o the holine&s;s of the man CHRIST JESUS, and of GOD him&s;elf. For 'natural nece&s;&s;i|ty is wholly incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;t prai&s;e and blame.' And would Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> deny, that the holine&s;s of GOD, his moral rectitude in gene|ral, is nece&s;&s;ary <HI>in it's own nature?</HI> And what is this, but to be nece&s;&s;ary by a <HI>natural</HI> nece&s;&s;ity?</P>
<P>FARTHER, by Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s principles, all virtue and vice in creatures is <HI>native</HI> or <HI>original.</HI> For every act of volition is the nece&s;&s;ary effect of internal, original bias&mdash;i. e. is owing to the original frame of the mind. The angels that &s;elf, and our common progenitors, were there|fore
<PB N="56" REF="011623_0068_0F8777D09FC289F8">
'made with a fixed, prevailing principle of &s;in in the heart.' Otherwi&s;e their &s;in proceeded not from internal, original bias&mdash;any more than from an 'indi&s;&s;oluble <HI>connection</HI> with a cau&s;e ne|ce&s;&s;ary in it's own nature.' If in truth their ori|ginal bias was not to evil&mdash;if they were endow|ed with the <HI>moral</HI> image of GOD, then their &s;in|ful volition was not the effect of original pro|pen&s;ity&mdash;nor did the nece&s;&s;ity of it lie <HI>in the will,</HI> in it's primitive &s;tate. Nor con&s;equently will this account for the permanency of holine&s;s in the an|gels in heaven. This cannot be the <HI>rationale</HI> of the abiding principle of holine&s;s in them; &s;ince it appears from fact, that creatures endowed with the moral image of GOD, may deface and forfeit it.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE 'the e&s;&s;ence of virtue and vice lies in the <HI>nature</HI> of volition, not in the cau&s;e'; it then follows, that the intrin&s;ic cau&s;e, the internal bias or propen&s;ity (which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the moral nece&s;&s;ity that determines the will) is not that which <HI>con&s;titutes</HI> the goodne&s;s, or wicked|ne&s;s, of the acts of the will. A vicious man's bias and inclination to &s;in, is not that which <HI>makes</HI> him &s;inful; the e&s;&s;ence of his &s;in lying not in &s;uch bias or inclination, but in the <HI>nature</HI> of the wicked thing. A &s;hrewd &s;olution! as if the character of moral agents were not always e&s;ti|mated from their propen&s;ity to good or evil. If 'moral nece&s;&s;ity lies in the will, and is the will's propen&s;ity,' it either follows, that there is no good or evil in any di&s;po&s;itions implanted in the hearts of men <HI>by nature;</HI> (contrary to a&s;&s;ertion, p. 303.) or if there be any good or evil in &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, this is entirely a di&s;tinct goodne&s;s or wickedne&s;s from the volitions them&s;elves, which they are the cau&s;e of. 'It would imply a contra|diction
<PB N="57" REF="011623_0069_0F8777D2564B9C70">
to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e two are the &s;ame in|dividual' goodne&s;s or 'wickedne&s;s. The' good or 'wicked act of the cau&s;e, in producing' goodne&s;s or 'wickedne&s;s is one' goodne&s;s or 'wickedne&s;s; and the' goodne&s;s or 'wickedne&s;s produced, if there be any produced, is another.' Will this be called arguing! What doth it amount to? The plain truth is, that when we &s;et our&s;elves to judge of human actions, we mu&s;t have no con&s;ideration of the &s;ource of them, but entirely detach them from their cau&s;es. Be the efficient who or what it will, all we have to attend to is, the effect pro|duced&mdash;by this we mu&s;t e&s;timate the goodne&s;s or wickedne&s;s of men, whether they determine them&s;elves, or are determined <HI>ab extra</HI>&mdash;whether they have power over their own wills, or have not. He therefore that with one original talent makes as great improvement as another with five, is no more prai&s;eworthy&mdash;that is, is not <HI>ac|cepted according to that he hath.</HI> He that offends again&s;t five degrees of light originally given, is guilty in no higher degree than he that offends again&s;t but one degree of light. The volition, or act, in both ca&s;es, we &s;uppo&s;e to be the &s;ame in regard to the &s;ubject matter of duty or &s;in&mdash;the &s;ame al&s;o in the general nature thereof. What then is the rea&s;on of different degrees of puni&s;hment for the &s;ame crime in different per|&s;ons? Not the nature of the crime as ab&s;tract|ed from the <HI>circum&s;tances</HI> of the agent, but as connected and compared herewith. Now if men are not the cau&s;e of their own volitions, then a determination to &s;in again&s;t ten degrees of light differs nothing from the like determina|tion again&s;t a &s;ingle degree of light: In both ca&s;es, the determination it&s;elf is alike nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable. So that there is no foundation
<PB N="58" REF="011623_0070_0F8777D2D98A9AD0">
for different degrees of guilt; becau&s;e, though we are won't to &s;peak of &s;uperior and le&s;&s;er ad|vantages, yet there is no real ground for this di&s;tinction, intelligent creatures being in no ca&s;e the authors, the voluntary de&s;igning cau&s;e of their inward determinations; at lea&s;t not of the fir&s;t and leading act, which decides the whole matter.

<P>INDEED had Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> &s;ucceeded in his attempt to &s;hew, that the "e&s;&s;ence of virtue and vice is not in their cau&s;e, but in their nature", he would not have obviated the objection &s;o of|ten made to the doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity, but never an&s;wered, that it is charging GOD with &s;in.</P>
<P>FOR admitting GOD to be the original cau&s;e of volition, but that being the cau&s;e of a &s;inful volition in the creature is a di&s;tinct wicked|ne&s;s from that which the cau&s;e produceth in the effect; &s;till the &s;upreme cau&s;e is &s;uppo&s;ed in fault; is charged with <HI>producing</HI> &s;in. There is no evading the con&s;equence, indeed, that the <HI>whole</HI> guilt of men's evil di&s;po&s;itions is chargeable on GOD, not them&s;elves, or on blind nece&s;&s;ity and fatality, if the things Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> advanceth be true.

<HEAD><HI>SECT. III.</HI> Upon Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s own Scheme, there cannot be <HI>natural</HI> Liberty without <HI>moral.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE acknowledge the title of this &s;ection contains a po&s;ition directly repugnant to Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s whole &s;cheme, and yet tru&s;t we &s;hall make it appear that the thing a&s;&s;erted plain|ly follows from things he hath advanced.</P>
<P>LIBERTY with re&s;pect to <HI>natural</HI> actions can be neither more nor le&s;s than according to the freedom of the <HI>will,</HI> or <HI>mind.</HI> For natural acti|ons, by &s;uppo&s;ition, are dependent and con&s;equent on, the fruits and effects of, the will's determi|nation, which is the cau&s;e of them. Now 'there cannot be more in the effect than in the cau&s;e. Tho&s;e things which are indi&s;&s;olubly connected with other things that are nece&s;&s;ary, are them|&s;elves nece&s;&s;ary.' Therefore if the acts of the will are nece&s;&s;ary, tho&s;e outward acts, which are the effects of nece&s;&s;ity in the will, mu&s;t be ne|ce&s;&s;ary 'by a nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>con&s;equence.'</HI> Now eve|ry act of the will is &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary. 'The &s;oul it&s;elf is the object of &s;omething acting upon, and influencing it. The fir&s;t and determining act of choice, which decides the whole affair, is out of our power.' So that in natural actions we are <HI>'cau&s;ed</HI> to act by &s;ome other agent.' Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> faith, 'it is no more a contradiction, to &s;uppo&s;e that action may be the effect of &s;ome <HI>other</HI> cau&s;e, be&s;ides the <HI>agent</HI> or <HI>being</HI> that acts,
<PB N="60" REF="011623_0072_0F8777D88A9FDD28">
than to &s;uppo&s;e that life may be the effect of &s;ome other cau&s;e be&s;ides the liver, or being that lives, in whom life is cau&s;ed to be.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Is a man active in that act by which he is brought into being?</NOTE> (286.) The acts of the &s;oul or will being, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary effects of &s;ome other cau&s;e than the agent, let it be &s;hewn how there can be &s;o much as natural liberty&mdash;meaning hereby a freedom from out|ward con&s;traint or re&s;traint.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Edwards</HI> a&s;&s;erts, 'The liberty of the will is not exerci&s;ed in any thing but what the will <HI>does'.</HI> (99.) 'The will in no in&s;tance whatever is it's <HI>own</HI> determiner'. Therefore the liberty of the will is not exerci&s;ed in any of the <HI>determinations</HI> of the will. Therefore not in determining to move the <HI>body.</HI> Therefore corporeal action is not <HI>vo|luntary.</HI> Therefore the will <HI>does</HI> nothing. There|fore it is <HI>exerci&s;ed</HI> in nothing. Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> promi&s;eth to 'demon&s;trate', that 'if the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> act in the train, determining and fixing the re&s;t, be not free, none of them all are free.' And a&s;&s;erts, that '<HI>GOD</HI>'s own immediate conduct is <HI>original</HI> in the &s;eries.'</P>
<P>In one word, external action is no more in our power than internal. To &s;ay that the will deter|mines the former is not true: For this would be to &s;uppo&s;e it is its own determiner at lea&s;t in this particular determination to move the body; con|trary to a&s;&s;ertion, that it is in no in&s;tance whatever it's own determiner. But &s;uppo&s;e material actions to be determined by the will, that herein men are the voluntary cau&s;es of their own actions&mdash;this is really attributing no power to the will or agent&mdash;&s;ince all the acts of the will &s;uppo&s;e an an&s;werable
<PB N="61" REF="011623_0073_0F8777D8FA132448">
cau&s;e without, as much as creation &s;uppo&s;eth a creator. (62.)</P>
<P>If material actions are &s;ubject to, and command|ed by, the will, &s;till this is &s;ubject to and deter|mined by preceeding nece&s;&s;ity. So that natural liberty is given up. For that is a &s;trange kind of liberty, which is founded in, and re&s;ults out of, nece&s;&s;ity. Whether this nece&s;&s;ity be natural or moral&mdash;whether it proceeds from an extrin&s;ic or intrin&s;ic cau&s;e, it equally militates again&s;t the &s;up|po&s;ition of freedom. The intelligent &s;y&s;tem is a curious piece of mechani&s;m.</P>
<P>Page 232 (and el&s;ewhere) Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> hath an eva&s;ion, which &s;carce de&s;erves a &s;erious an|&s;wer It is this, 'that a man may be &s;aid to have a thing in his power, if he has it at his <HI>election;</HI> i. e. if he <HI>now</HI> plea&s;eth, and has a <HI>direct and imme|diate</HI> de&s;ire for it, he is not unable to do it.' This, in mo&s;t writers, would be e&s;teemed meer quibbling. For if a man is morally incapable of a 'direct and immediate de&s;ire' to a thing, how can he be &s;aid to have it in his power? Would Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> &s;ay, that things are in or out of men's power, farther than <HI>chu&s;ing or refu&s;ing</HI> is &s;o, as well as the con&s;equent acts depending hereon? It is not improper to &s;ay, 'that a per&s;on' <HI>cannot</HI> 'perform tho&s;e actions, which depend on an act of will, when the act of will it&s;elf cannot be pre|&s;ent,' but is forever impo&s;&s;ible'&mdash;when the di&s;|po&s;ition to the contrary is 'as &s;trong and im|moveable as the bars of a ca&s;tle,' by <HI>nature</HI>&mdash;when want of inclination proceeds from na|ture; or original bias. For 'the event is de|pendent on it's cau&s;e.' And the cau&s;e not being put, the event cannot take place. Ad|mitting that &s;uch a &s;tate of the will may be
<PB N="62" REF="011623_0074_0F8777D9A397EC58">
required as is forever impo&s;&s;ible; this can be only on a &s;uppo&s;ition of an ability once gi|ven and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but lo&s;t. Who will &s;ay, that a man has in his power what is and mu&s;t be impo&s;&s;ible? So that when we are told, 'that the common people, in their notion of a faulty or praise-worthy deed, &s;uppo&s;e the man does it in the exerci&s;e of <HI>liberty;</HI> but that their notion of liberty is only a per&s;on's having opportunity of doing as he plea&s;es'&mdash;i. e. of <HI>executing</HI> a choice already made, we mu&s;t e&s;teem this trifting. For what liberty is there when choice it&s;elf is out of a man's power&mdash;is the effect of an antecedent nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e? 'In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> act of choice, which decides the whole matter,' he is nece&s;&s;arily determined. In this Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> con&s;tantly a&s;&s;erts a man has not power, or liberty of choice, while he grants him a power or capacity of <HI>con&s;equent</HI> choice. That is, in other words, a capacity of being acted up|on by &s;ome other cau&s;e or agent.</P>
<P>UPON the whole: Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> allows, that liberty is e&s;&s;ential to prai&s;e or blame, reward or puni&s;hment; but teacheth, that the internal &s;tate of the mind or will proceeds not from, is not determined by, our&s;elves. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quaere, Whether Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s motto at all favors this opinion? It is taken from Rom. ix.xvi. <HI>It is not of him that willeth.</HI> That is, (if we attend to the words taken by them&s;elves, or in their connection) <HI>outward action</HI> is not of him that willeth. It is &s;up|po&s;ed he hath <HI>willed,</HI> and that the will is <HI>from him|&s;elf</HI>&mdash;HIM <HI>that willeth.</HI> But he hath not power or opportunity to <HI>execute</HI> his will. <HI>I&s;aac</HI> did really will to give the ble&s;&s;ing to <HI>E&s;au&mdash;E&s;au</HI> did run for veni&s;on to obtain it.

<P>MR <HI>Edwards</HI> teacheth, 'That GOD, when he had made man, &s;o ordered his circum|&s;tances, that <HI>from the&s;e circum&s;tances,</HI> together with the withholding divine influence and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, his &s;in <HI>infallibly followed.</HI>' And when it is a&s;ked hereupon, 'why might not GOD as well have fir&s;t made man with a fixed, prevail|ing principle of &s;in in his heart?' Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> intimates in his an&s;wer, that GOD might indeed have done &s;o; but adds, that if man had been thus made at fir&s;t, 'it would not have been &s;o <HI>vi&s;ible,</HI> that &s;in did not ari&s;e from GOD, as the po&s;itive cau&s;e, and real &s;ource of it&mdash;that there|fore <HI>it was meet</HI> man &s;hould not be made with &s;in in his heart, that &s;in might appear to ari&s;e from the imperfection of the creature, 'and not from GOD as the efficient or fountain.'

He 'di&s;po&s;eth the &s;tate of events in &s;uch a manner, that &s;in mo&s;t certainly follows therefrom. In &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, I do not deny, that GOD is the author of &s;in. It is no reproach for the mo&s;t high to be thus the au|thor of &s;in.

<P><PB N="64" REF="011623_0076_0F8777DBE9FB8B18">Now how doth it appear, on the&s;e principles, that God is not the po&s;itive cau&s;e, and real &s;ource of moral evil?

'Thus' Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s 'notion of liberty, con&s;i&s;ting' in external freedom, 'is repugnant to it&s;elf, and &s;huts it&s;elf wholly out of the world.'</P>
<P>WERE it indeed true, as Mr <HI>Edwards</HI> inci|dentally ob&s;erves, (contrary to the general doc|trine of his book, and his whole &s;cheme) that we 'have command over our <HI>thoughts</HI>'&mdash;(p. 894) that 'the acts of the <HI>will</HI> are free'&mdash;that 'the <HI>&s;oul</HI> has freedom'&mdash;(p. 116, 224) this might &s;olve the difficulty, as it would be to make men the voluntary de&s;igning cau&s;e of tho&s;e inward acts wherein the nature of virtue and vice con&s;i&s;ts. But, as before ob&s;erved, Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> con&s;tantly denies an inward principle, &s;ource, or power of activity&mdash;and blames tho&s;e divines who contend for the freedom of the &s;oul <HI>in willing.</HI> He allows, that a man hath 'pow|er to move his body agreably to an antecedent act of choice, but not to u&s;e or exert the facul|ties of his &s;oul.' (p. 131) How then 'hath the &s;oul a power of volition or choice?' (p. 39) of chu&s;ing for in&s;tance, to move the body, when it hath not a power of exerting its own facul|ties? How much more con&s;i&s;tent would it have been for Mr <HI>Edwards</HI> to have &s;aid, that the will's determining is a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> determining&mdash; for the &s;oul to act <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> is evermore to act nece&s;&s;arily?&mdash;(that is, the will does not determine, the &s;oul does not act) than to &s;ay, 'the will's determining is a <HI>free</HI> determining&mdash;for the &s;oul to act <HI>voluntarily</HI> is evermore to act <HI>electively'?</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="011623_0080_0F8777DEE9FBD938">
The will, the &s;oul, may be <HI>acted upon,</HI> and have &s;uch a volition or choice produced in it, <HI>in con|&s;equence,</HI> and as the <HI>effect,</HI> of &s;ome cau&s;e operat|ing on it, <HI>deciding</HI> and <HI>determining</HI> the volition. What Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> calls the &s;oul's <HI>voluntary, elective</HI> acts, are the effects of a cau&s;e indepen|dent on man. The acts and exerci&s;es of the human mind (if they may be called its acts) are owing not to any active power in the mind, to any thing within its power, but entirely to the energy of a nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e, which is prior to what are called its own acts. Volition is free or voluntary <HI>with a freedom of moral nece&s;&s;ity</HI>&mdash; a nece&s;&s;ity <HI>as ab&s;olute as natural.</HI> And thus it is, that a man's heart comes to be wrong or right.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Edwards</HI> teacheth, that GOD 'orders the volitions of moral agents, among other events, with &s;uch a <HI>deci&s;ive</HI> di&s;po&s;al, that the events are infallibly connected with his di&s;po|&s;al&mdash;that an univer&s;al, <HI>determining</HI> providence in|fers an infallible, previous fixedne&s;s of all e|vents&mdash;that GOD's own immediate conduct is fir&s;t in the &s;eries, and this alone unconnected with any thing preceeding&mdash;that he cau&s;eth the di&s;po&s;ition of the mind to be more in favour of &s;uch acts'&mdash;(vicious no le&s;s than virtuous) 'or bringeth the mind more into view of powerful motives and inducements'&mdash;that all things are invariably &s;ettled&mdash;and 'nece&s;&s;ity be|longs to all moral agents.' His &s;cheme, upon the whole, appears to be nearly the &s;ame with that exhibited by the celebrated Mr. <HI>Hume,</HI> an <HI>epicurean athei&s;t,</HI> which we &s;hall give the reader in his own words. 'There is a continued chain of nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;es, fore-ordained, and pre-de|termined,

reaching from the original cau&s;e of all to every &s;ingle volition of every human crea|ture. While we act, we are, at the &s;ame time, acted upon.

<P>TO this &s;cheme, Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> &s;uppo&s;eth it will be objected in the following form.

He tells us, 'It is not po&s;&s;ible to explain di&s;tinctly, how the Dei|ty can be the immediate cau&s;e of all the actions of men, without being the author of &s;in and moral turpitude.

<P>MR. <HI>Hume</HI> acknowledgeth, that upon his &s;cheme, the Deity is the <HI>mediate, original</HI> cau&s;e or all the actions of men; and virtually admits the con&s;equence; (that he is therefore the au|thor of &s;in and moral turpitude) by ob&s;erving, that it is not po&s;&s;ible di&s;tinctly to explain, how he can be the one, and not the other.

<P>HAVING taken notice of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s doctrine, in a&s;&s;erting GOD to be the au|thor of &s;in, except that he is not 'the <HI>actor</HI> of it, or <HI>doer</HI> of the wicked thing; and the eva|&s;ion which &s;uch a doctrine <HI>needed,</HI> that 'the e&s;&s;ence of a &s;inful volition is in its nature, not in its <HI>cau&s;e</HI>'; the next advance he makes, in order to reconcile the exi&s;tence of &s;in with the divine choice and determination, in the invaria|ble nece&s;&s;ity or it, is, that moral evil is <HI>be&s;t</HI> for the world&mdash;that therefore 'an infinitely wi&s;e being, who always chu&s;es what is be&s;t, mu&s;t chu&s;e there &s;hould be &s;uch a thing'&mdash;that this is not chu&s;ing what is properly evil upon the whole, becau&s;e 'of the great good which is the con&s;equence of &s;in, for the &s;ake' of which GOD is &s;uppo&s;ed to 'will &s;in.' He therefore a&s;&s;erts, that 'moral evil is not of <HI>a bad, but good ten|dency</HI>'&mdash;that 'the coming to pa&s;s of every indi|vidual act of &s;in is truly, all things con&s;idered, agreable to infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s.' (Part iv. &s;ect. 9th.)</P>
<P>FOR all this he quotes with approbation Dr. <HI>Turnbull,</HI> again&s;t whom he had before wrote and publi&s;hed part of an elaborate volume.

When it is a&s;ked, <HI>Whence comes evil?</HI> this Gen|tleman denies the hypothe&s;is, and an&s;wers, <HI>'There is no evil in the univer&s;e.</HI> What! is there no mi&s;ery, no vice in the world? or are not the&s;e <HI>evils?</HI> Evils indeed they are; that is, tho&s;e of one &s;ort are hurtful, and tho&s;e of the other &s;ort are equally hurtful and abominable; But they are <HI>not</HI> evil or mi&s;chievous with re|&s;pect to the <HI>whole.</HI> The evil which happens is requi&s;ite to the <HI>greater good.'</HI></P>
<P>THAT GOD may, and does many times, overrule things &s;o, as to bring good out of mo|ral evil, we deny not. From the apo&s;tacy of mankind, he hath taken occa&s;ion to manife&s;t <HI>the exceeding riches of his grace.</HI> He al&s;o fre|quently improves vicious and profligate &s;inners (be&s;ide, and contrary to, their own intention) as in&s;truments of great and general good. But doth it therefore follow, that profligate wicked|ne&s;s is not of bad, but good <HI>tendency?</HI> That every individual act of it is agreable to perfect wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, and be&s;t for the world?</P>
<P>'THOUGH the con&s;titution of our nature, from whence we are capable of vice and mi&s;e|ry, may, as it undoubtedly does, contribute to the perfection and happine&s;s of the world; and though the actual permi&s;&s;ion of evil may be be|neficial to it: (that is, it would have been more mi&s;chievous, not that a wicked per&s;on had <HI>him|&s;elf</HI> ab&s;tained from his own wickedne&s;s, <HI>but that any one had forcibly prevented it,</HI> than that it was permitted:) Yet notwith&s;tanding, it might have been much better for the world, if this very evil had never been done. Nay, it is mo&s;t clearly conceivable, that the very commi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="74" REF="011623_0086_0F8777E93A5891B8">
of wickedne&s;s may be beneficial to the world, and yet, that it would be infinitely more beneficial for men to refrain from it. For thus, in the wi&s;e and good con&s;titution of the natural world, there are di&s;orders which bring their own cures; di&s;ea&s;es, which are them&s;elves remedies. Many a man would have died, had it not been for the gout or a fever; yet it would be thought madne&s;s to a&s;&s;ert, that &s;ickne&s;s is a bet|ter or a more perfect &s;tate than health; though the like, with regard to the moral world, has been a&s;&s;erted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Butler</HI>'s Analogy, edit. 4, p. 188, 189.</NOTE></P>
<P>GOD's law, originally given to man, was doubtle&s;s good and perfect. It was doubtle&s;s agreable to perfect wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, that he &s;hould yield a &s;teady and uniform obedience to it. Thus he would have glorified his Crea|tor, an&s;wered the end of his being, and provid|ed for his own highe&s;t happine&s;s. But &s;uppo|&s;ing moral evil to be no evil upon the whole, but a great good, &s;uch con&s;equences as the&s;e will follow. That the law given to man at fir&s;t was imperfect&mdash;that it was better, all things con&s;idered, that the divine law (the law of man's nature) &s;hould be broke than kept&mdash;that GOD threatned di&s;obedience with the pe|nalty of death, and yet cho&s;e man &s;hould rebel, 'for the &s;ake of the great good con&s;equent on &s;in'&mdash;that the ends of infinite wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s could be an&s;wered, no po&s;&s;ible way devi&s;ed to advance the <HI>highe&s;t happine&s;s</HI> of the intelligent creation, but by the entrance of <HI>infinite evil</HI> into the world&mdash;that the revolt of men and angels was in compliance with the end of their being,

and the wi&s;e and gracious intention of the Crea|tor&mdash;(and if &s;o, 'why did not GOD make them at fir&s;t with a fixed prevailing principle of &s;in?') Yea, it follows, that intemperance, debauchery, oppre&s;&s;ion, murther, malice, envy, all the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h and &s;pirit, greatly conduce to the good of the world, and are perfectly agreable to the wi&s;e and good governor of it. What obli|gations do mankind owe to drunkards and gluttons, to fornicators and adulterers, to the fraudulent and oppre&s;&s;ors, to thieves and liars, and fal&s;e &s;wearers, to robbers and murtherers, and all that great multitude, whom the faithful and true witne&s;s hath expre&s;sly excluded from the heavenly Jeru&s;alem, and con&s;igned to one common lake of fire and brim&s;tone! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi 8 and xxii 15.</NOTE> Which judgment according to truth the world have been wont to te&s;tify their approbation of in their treatment of &s;uch per&s;ons&mdash;that is, their greate&s;t benefactors!

<P>HOW &s;in came to be permitted is more than we can comprehend. To &s;ay it could not have been prevented is &s;aying more than any one knows. To &s;ay that' GOD cho&s;e it, and deter|mined the will of the creature to it, is impious, even &s;uppo&s;ing it is in fact followed with grea|ter good, than otherwi&s;e would have been&mdash; which &s;uppo&s;ition is, however, but meer conjec|ture at be&s;t, and without any &s;olid foundation. For unle&s;s we can tell what would have been had &s;in never entered the world, it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be able to judge, by way of compari|&s;on, of the greater good con&s;equent upon it; or be able to &s;ay, that it was be&s;t upon the

whole. From the mi&s;eries of it, which we &s;ee and feel, we have no &s;pecial rea&s;on to infer its &s;uperior advantages, and good tendency. And notwith&s;tanding the infinite rea&s;on we have to receive it as <HI>a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation, that JESUS CHRIST came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners;</HI> yet that he came to re&s;tore mankind to a <HI>better</HI> &s;tate than they would have been rai&s;ed to, had they never &s;inned, is more than we have yet learned from the holy &s;crip|tures.</P>
<P>BE this as it will: Suppo&s;e it to be indeed true, that the con&s;equence of &s;in is the greater good of the univer&s;e, it will not therefore fol|low, that GOD mu&s;t chu&s;e and determine it. If an apo&s;tle &s;uppo&s;ed their damnation to be ju&s;t, who do evil with a view to greater good; &s;hall we venture to impute any thing like this to GOD? Suppo&s;e (in the in&s;tances Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> brings) <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s brethren had fore&s;een the <HI>con|&s;equences</HI> of their treatment of him, would this have ju&s;tified their conduct, and rendered it me|ritorious?&mdash;what as wi&s;e and good men they mu&s;t have cho&s;e? (p. 374, 375) The &s;ame que&s;tion, on the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ition, offers it&s;elf in relation to the murderers of our Savior. To &s;ay that GOD wills evil for the &s;ake of its good tendency, is a reproach to an holy and good be|ing, who cannot chu&s;e moral evil at all&mdash;any more than a man of rea&s;on and con&s;cience can chu&s;e what he knows to be &s;inful, from the cleare&s;t pro&s;pect of great publick advantage. The moral Governor of the world will pur&s;ue the happine&s;s of it, in &s;uch ways, and by &s;uch means only, as are ju&s;t and holy. And we might with more propriety &s;uppo&s;e, he will not

take care of the happine&s;s of his creatures at all, than that he doth this by chu&s;ing &s;in as the on|ly &s;ure means of the greate&s;t good. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To admit that any created being can act in a manner contrary to what it does, or fulfil any other end, is tantamount, &s;aith Mr. <HI>Collins,</HI> to allowing it to be independent of the Deity; and con&s;equently, to have it in its election and power to thwart the &s;chemes of the great author and &s;uperintendent of all things, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> His an&s;werer very ju&s;tly replies, 'All this is nothing but &s;uppo&s;ing it a contradiction that GOD &s;hould endue the human <HI>mind,</HI> or any creature, with liberty of action.

Man is ever &s;ubject to the providential government of GOD, and accountable to him for his actions; and, as he does good or evil to him&s;elf or others, is liable to receive rewards or puni&s;hments. This &s;ufficiently &s;hews the <HI>dependency</HI> of man upon GOD; and as much &s;o, as if his actions were <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> For as in the latter ca&s;e, he would <HI>depend</HI> upon GOD as an <HI>in|&s;trument</HI> only in the hands of an agent; or, as the inanimate creation <HI>depends</HI> upon him, meerly as a machine upon the framer and director of it; &s;o in the former ca&s;e he depends upon GOD as a <HI>moral</HI> governor, who &s;uperintends his actions, and from whom he has rea&s;on to expect to be recompen&s;ed according to his work&mdash;And no power what&s;oever can deliver him out of GOD's hands.

<HEAD><HI>SECT. VI.</HI> Containing <HI>general Ob&s;ervations</HI> and <HI>Reflections</HI> on the Scheme of Nece&s;&s;ity exhibited in Mr. <HI>Ed|wards</HI>'s Book.</HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> hath &s;aid upon the di&s;tinction between <HI>na|tural</HI> and <HI>moral nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> we cannot but think this 'di&s;tinction altogether impertinent in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y.' For 'that which is nece&s;&s;ary, is nece&s;&s;ary, mu&s;t be, and cannot be prevented.' If there be a real nece&s;&s;ity on the mind in all its acts, it is quite immaterial whether this nece&s;&s;ity, by which the mind is in every in&s;tance determi|ned, be called natural or moral. Whether will and endeavour is overcome by external, con|&s;traint; or whether &s;uch a &s;tate of the will or &s;oul is produced by &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e, extrin|&s;ic or intrin&s;ic, amounts to much the &s;ame thing in the end. There is exactly the &s;ame propriety in &s;aying, that &s;uch a thing <HI>cannot</HI> be done, is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible, unavoidable, nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> &amp;c, where there is a <HI>moral</HI> inability to it, as in applying the&s;e epi|thets to a <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> inability: For if the act of the mind, on which the natural act depends, be for ever impo&s;&s;ible, the natural act mu&s;t be alike im|po&s;&s;ible&mdash;unle&s;s it be &s;aid, that it is <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> an effect may be produced without a cau&s;e. What Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> hath &s;aid to &s;hew, that natural acti|ons,
<PB N="81" REF="011623_0093_0F8777F02596E8D8">
which are determined by the mind, are po&s;&s;i|ble, when the determination of the mind <HI>it&s;elf</HI> re&s;pecting them is forever impo&s;&s;ible, is un&s;ati&s;|factory, and unintelligible to us. If no being can chu&s;e or act otherwi&s;e than he doth, we can|not conceive of a nece&s;&s;ity more ab&s;olute; and &s;uch is the nece&s;&s;ity maintained by Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>&mdash; only he approves not the terms <HI>natural nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> and thinks the word <HI>certainty</HI> more proper&mdash; While he a&s;&s;erts all events to be <HI>morally</HI> nece&s;&s;a|ry&mdash;and that in things thus nece&s;&s;ary there is a 'connection <HI>prior</HI> and <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to will and endea|vour.' (294.)</P>
<P>AFTER all that hath been &s;aid, <HI>moral nece&s;&s;ity</HI> is, properly &s;peaking, <HI>natural nece&s;&s;ity; moral</HI> power is <HI>natural</HI> power. The one is as <HI>original</HI> to us as the other. The latter is interwoven in our frame no otherwi&s;e than the former. The moral faculty, or power, which Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> &s;aith belongs to moral agency, is a natural facul|ty or power. So that whatever moral capacity or incapacity is attributed to mankind, the &s;ame is natural. If man is a law to him&s;elf it is <HI>by na|ture</HI> that he is &s;o, having the work of the law written on his heart. And as to the inability of man, Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> we pre&s;ume, believed this to be derived from <HI>nature</HI>&mdash;to have it's &s;ource in 'the want of original righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the cor|ruption of the whole nature.' Now an inability which has it's &s;ource in the very <HI>nature</HI> of man may &s;urely be called a <HI>natural</HI> inability.</P>
<P>MUCH hath been &s;aid to &s;hew, that every mo|ral event mu&s;t have an an&s;werable cau&s;e. Be it &s;o. Every &s;uch event mu&s;t then have a <HI>moral</HI> cau&s;e. And whether any other than an <HI>intelli|gent
<PB N="82" REF="011623_0094_0F8777F0DBCC41B8">
mind</HI> can be &s;uch a cau&s;e, let tho&s;e who have common under&s;tanding judge. If it be admit|ted, that a moral cau&s;e mu&s;t be a moral agent, then it will follow, that we are the cau&s;es of our own volitions, or that our maker is the cau&s;e of them. Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> denies the fir&s;t&mdash;therefore our volitions are to be attributed to GOD as their proper cau&s;e. But however this might be ad|mitted of <HI>holy</HI> volitions, we cannot think it will be admitted of <HI>&s;inful</HI> ones. And if not, what regard &s;hould be had to a doctrine of which this is the direct con&s;equence? We are &s;elf-deter|mined, or determined by the deity. If there be any difference between a <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> and a meer <HI>in|&s;trument,</HI> the former denotes a mind that hath wi&s;dom, power &amp;c, in a greater or le&s;s degree, according to the effects a&s;cribed to it. And if moral events, through a chain of &s;econd cau&s;es, centre in the deity, as natural effects do, what is this but running up morals to <HI>mechani&s;m?</HI> any pains Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> hath taken to avoid &s;uch an imputation on his &s;cheme notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>IN our author's &s;cheme, nece&s;&s;ity is <HI>univer&s;al.</HI> The divine will is always determined by it, and the will of every creature. Now GOD is either the author of this nece&s;&s;ity, to which he him&s;elf is &s;ubject, or he is not. If he is, then all the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ects of it are to be a&s;cribed to him as their proper cau&s;e. If he is not, then there is &s;ome cau&s;e <HI>prior</HI> to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> cau&s;e, binding and deter|mining him&mdash; he is cau&s;ed to determine as he doth by &s;omething <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> (For to &s;ay he is determined by &s;ometning <HI>intrin&s;ic,</HI> is to &s;ay he is <HI>&s;elf-determined</HI>&mdash;contrary to &s;uppo&s;ition.) His being and volitions are <HI>effects</HI> as much as tho&s;e of finite creatures. That nece&s;&s;ity, which is
<PB N="83" REF="011623_0095_0F8777F19B659490">
&s;aid to be the cau&s;e of every determination of the divine will, the cau&s;e and ground of his ex|i&s;tence and perfections, is prior, by &s;uppo&s;ition, to his exi&s;tence and volitions. And this nece&s;|&s;ity mu&s;t be determined by &s;omething preceed|ing, and &s;o on. Yea, Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> makes expre&s;s mention of the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of moral nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;and &s;ays, that the cau&s;e of this nece&s;&s;ity is equally ne|ce&s;&s;ary as of natural. That is, there is a nece&s;|&s;ary cau&s;e of this cau&s;e, and &s;o on <HI>in infinitum.</HI> Thus we are run back far into non-entity, and have to enquire, By what cau&s;e the fir&s;t cau&s;e exi&s;ts&mdash;which cau&s;e is an effect in relation to &s;omething preceeding, and this an effect with relation to &s;omething &s;till preceeding, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> And if &s;omething exterior and prior to the Dei|ty determines him, what is this but affirming him to be the almighty mini&s;ter of <HI>fate?</HI> How|ever Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> hath expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;inclina|tion to fatali&s;m, (in which we doubt not his &s;in|cerity) we think his rea&s;oning is plainly on the &s;ide of ab&s;olute fatality; and &s;uppo&s;e he was caught in his own &s;ubtilty. Upon his &s;cheme it follows, that the actions of all finite beings are the agency of the Deity; and his is not properly &s;peaking <HI>agency,</HI> but <HI>in&s;trumentality</HI>&mdash; a &s;ubjection to blind nece&s;&s;ity and fate. There is no &s;elf-mover, &s;elf-direction, &s;elf-determina|tion, or &s;ource of activity, in the univer&s;e. Li|berty is bani&s;hed out of the world&mdash;and the world mu&s;t have been eternal.</P>
<P>WHETHER GOD could have acted otherwi&s;e than he hath? is a curious rather than profita|ble enquiry. And as to the notion' of 'fitne&s;s of things, independent of the things them&s;elves, and without reference to the &s;overeign mind,'
<PB N="84" REF="011623_0096_0F8777F2E6551470">
it is difficult even to imagine it; to &s;ay nothing of the impiety implied in &s;uch a thought.</P>
<P>WE have repre&s;ented what we apprehend is the plain tendency, and indeed only con&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;e, of the &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity before us. Whe|ther it was copied from Mr. <HI>Hume, Hobbs, Spi|noza,</HI> or any of the old heathen Philo&s;ophers we do not &s;ay. We hint the thing becau&s;e of a remarkable coincidence we have exhibited at the clo&s;e of the&s;e remarks, in &s;ome extracts from them, &s;et over again&s;t &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s book. Though we have a right to renew valid objections, how oft &s;oever they have been made before, until &s;ome tolerable an&s;wer is given to them (e&s;pecially when the old doc|trines, to which the like objections were former|ly made, but not an&s;wered, are received.) Yet we would not repeat the charge, without giving a &s;pecimen in &s;upport of it. We really are per|&s;uaded, that there can be no po&s;&s;ible confutation of fatali&s;m on the principles of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s book. He &s;peaks with &s;atisfaction of the progre&s;s of <HI>metaphy&s;ic &s;cience;</HI> (325) of which and its 'ter|rible doings,' his own book, among others on fatality, is an alarming proof. [<HI>Epicurus,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> reminds us, was 'the father of <HI>athei&s;m and licentiou&s;ne&s;s,' David Hume,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> is the fa|ther of modern epicuri&s;m: And whoever hath read his e&s;&s;ays and Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s enquiry is better able to judge than one can from the few &s;elect pa&s;&s;ages we have extracted, of the agree|ment between them.]</P>
<P>NOT that we &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> &s;aw, or allowed, the tendency and con&s;equences of his &s;cheme to be &s;uch as we have here repre&s;ented;
<PB N="85" REF="011623_0097_0F8777F3559905B0">
he hath repeatedly declared the contrary. Still if the con&s;equences are fairly deduced&mdash;if in tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages wherein he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf a friend to liberty he is either repugnant to him|&s;elf, or allows no liberty that is of any moment, or not connected with moral agency&mdash;let any man of rea&s;on &s;ay, whether his &s;cheme can be &s;afe. His doctrine of nece&s;&s;ary connection, if plainly reducible to the con&s;equences we have mentioned, if con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf only in that &s;en&s;e we have taken it, will be rejected by all who have a due regard to the moral perfections of GOD, for which we doubt not in the lea&s;t but Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> had a &s;upreme veneration. But great and good men are not always wi&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is very much Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s method to an&s;wer objections by endeavouring to reduce the &s;cheme of his adver&s;aries to the &s;ame ab&s;ur|dity; which, though it be a good argument <HI>ad hominem,</HI> is by no means &s;atisfactory.

<P>WITHOUT controverting with Mr. <HI>Ed|wards,</HI> or any others, the propriety or impropriety of a&s;cribing liberty to the faculty of <HI>will,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> &s;ugge&s;ts, (p. 38, 39) that &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed liberty to belong to the 'faculty, power, or property called will, ab&s;tractedly con&s;idered; and &s;aith 'To talk of liberty or the contrary, as belong|ing to the <HI>very will it&s;elf,</HI> is not to &s;peak good &s;en&s;e.

We know of none, who have contended for the freedom of the will, that have u&s;ed the term will in this ab&s;tracted &s;en&s;e. This curious di&s;tinction (made to &s;hew, that there it not liberty in the will) was not &s;ufficiently attended to by our author. For through his book, the term will is generally u&s;ed to denote the &s;oul, the man, the agent, the mind.

from <HI>natural?</HI> whether there be free|dom in the <HI>mind,</HI> or <HI>&s;oul?</HI> If it can be &s;hewn, that the mind or &s;oul is free, it is to very little purpo&s;e to enquire, in what particular faculty of the agent freedom lies; or whether in any one faculty exclu&s;ively, or e&s;pecially. Such an enquiry cannot be very edifying. Metaphy&s;i|cians may think it a fit &s;ubject of &s;peculation; but to common &s;en&s;e it appears frivolous. The &s;imple notion of liberty we &s;hall argue for, is this, that <HI>mankind have inward moral freedom</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some have &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>&s;pontaneous animal motion</HI> proves liberty. But though this may be an evidence of &s;uch kind of liberty as Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> allows be|longs to moral agents, yet we think it &s;ugge&s;ts not the idea of <HI>internal, moral</HI> liberty&mdash;the only liberty which properly belongs to the &s;ubject of religion and morals.</NOTE>&mdash; a power of <HI>&s;elf-determination.</HI> (Not meaning by &s;elf-determination &s;uch a power in 'the proper|ty or faculty of <HI>will,'</HI> but in the <HI>agent.</HI>) It may otherwi&s;e be called an inward principle or power of <HI>activity.</HI> That &s;uch a power belongs to mo|ral agents, particularly to mankind, is what we &s;hall endeavour to evince; without endeavour|ing to &s;tate the exact <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> in which it is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, or within what <HI>&s;phere</HI> exerci&s;ed by them. In &s;ome it may be in greater perfection, in others le&s;s. But &s;ome degree of it is e&s;&s;ential to mo|ral agency. At lea&s;t all moral agents, during

their probation, po&s;&s;e&s;s it in &s;ome mea&s;ure and degree.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Edwards,</HI> as hath been &s;hewn, denies all &s;elf-determining power, and inward liberty&mdash;a&s;|&s;erting, that '<HI>every</HI> determination of the will in chu&s;ing and refu&s;ing is nece&s;&s;ary.' (p 111, 113) But that an inward principle of activity, and power of volition or choice, belongs to mankind, we think is in a manner &s;elf-evident. For it is granted on all hands, that moral good and evil lie in the &s;tate of the mind, or prevailing internal di&s;po&s;ition of the agent. Liberty therefore, if at all nece&s;&s;ary to virtue and vice, mu&s;t be ex|erci&s;ed in that wherein the <HI>nature</HI> of morality and religion con&s;i&s;ts&mdash;that is, in the inward man. A freedom from <HI>external con&s;traint</HI> is a liberty belonging to fools and madmen, and to the brute creatures. The&s;e, therefore, are as capable of virtue and vice, prai&s;e and blame, as beings endowed with, and in the exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, if this external (hypothetical) liberty is the only thing nece&s;&s;ary to moral agency. Fools, madmen, and brutes, if they are not bound or impri&s;oned, have natural liberty. They have a power, faculty, or property called <HI>will.</HI> Their actions are as voluntary (in many re&s;pects) as tho&s;e of mankind, who are of a found under|&s;tanding The actions of brutes proceed from inclination and de&s;ign&mdash;an inclination and de|&s;ign proceeding from nature, or internal, ori|ginal bias.</P>
<P>IF then an action's being <HI>voluntary</HI> (in the &s;en&s;e of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s book) makes it virtuous or vicious, the lower animals are &s;o as really as intelligent creatures. As we are not accu&s;tom|ed
<PB N="90" REF="011623_0102_0F8775B7A1BD0238">
to talk of virtuous or vicious herds of cattle, the epithets, as applied to them, may &s;ound &s;omething odd and har&s;h at fir&s;t; but by the help of metaphy&s;ics we may in time be recon|ciled to &s;uch language. We are not, indeed, to &s;uppo&s;e our oxen and hor&s;es are morally good or bad in tho&s;e actions of theirs which are again&s;t their wills&mdash;to which they are externally <HI>impel|led</HI>&mdash;Or in regard to any in&s;tances of forbear|ance, which are owing to external <HI>impediment</HI>&mdash; to which they have a will, and endeavour to perform, but are hindered from doing as they would. But the ca&s;es of <HI>coaction</HI> and <HI>re&s;traint</HI> excepted, let it be &s;hewn, on the pre&s;ent hypothe|&s;is, that they are not proper &s;ubjects of commenda|tion or blame, reward or puni&s;hment&mdash;and by the &s;ame arguments we pre&s;ume it may be &s;hewn, that mankind are not. If power or opportuni|ty to <HI>execute</HI> a will or choice already produced by &s;ome extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, be all that is meant by liberty, or that is nece&s;&s;ary to moral agency, li|berty is perfectly <HI>ideal,</HI> and the controver&s;y a|bout it is about a meer <HI>word.</HI> But if liberty be <HI>really</HI> e&s;&s;ential to moral agency, as Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> admits; and if there cannot be liberty of acting or conducting farther than there is liberty of willing, chu&s;ing, preferring, as hath been &s;hewn&mdash;the plain con&s;equence is, that liberty in the <HI>mind</HI> is e&s;&s;ential to moral agency. Upon Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s &s;cheme of liberty, it is not for the acts and exerci&s;es of their minds that men are accountable, but only for their outward actions. There is no moral turpitude in &s;uch a &s;tate of the &s;oul or will as our Saviour de&s;cribes, <HI>Matt.</HI> v. 28, 32, but only in the <HI>execution</HI> of &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition. We know, indeed, that Mr. <HI>Ed|wards</HI> intended not to a&s;&s;ert any &s;uch thing as
<PB N="91" REF="011623_0103_0F8775B861111E50">
this, that malice, envy, pride, impure de&s;ires, &amp;c. are innocent until they become effects: But is not this the con&s;equence of his allowing, that liberty is nece&s;&s;ary to moral agency, while he makes this liberty con&s;i&s;t only in a power a man hath to <HI>execute</HI> his will. If Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> in|tended not to a&s;&s;ert the above con&s;equence, (as it is plain he did not) then in the enquiry where|in the liberty of man con&s;i&s;ts, &s;omething farther is to be con&s;idered than material action&mdash;There mu&s;t be internal liberty, if liberty enters into the notion of a prai&s;e-worthy deed, or the con|trary. The proper que&s;tion, is, <HI>Whether we have and exerci&s;e liberty in that wherein the nature of virtue and vice con&s;i&s;ts?</HI> And one might think this would not be made a que&s;tion.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay that the mind is nece&s;&s;arily determin|ed in all its acts, is making mankind nece&s;&s;ary agents in <HI>that</HI> thing which di&s;tingui&s;heth them from the inferior creatures. Without mo|ral liberty, it is plain their actions cannot be of a moral nature, any more than tho&s;e can be cal|led naturally free actions, which proceed from natural nece&s;&s;ity. Abridge a man's natural li|berty ever &s;o much, his moral freedom may re|main; and if it doth, the willing or unwilling mind is rewardable or puni&s;hable. On the con|trary, &s;uppo&s;e moral liberty taken away, or ra|ther, never to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and there is an utter incapacity of moral action. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>'Man either has within him&s;elf a <HI>principle of action,</HI> properly &s;peaking, that it, a <HI>&s;elf-moving</HI> faculty, a <HI>principle</HI> or <HI>power of beginning motion;</HI> or he has not.

<P>DR. <HI>Clark,</HI> (in his 'demon&s;tration of the being and attributes of GOD,' (tenth edition p. 83, 86) has argued the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> and <HI>reality</HI> of the communication of liberty to man in the following clear and conclu|&s;ive manner. 'As a power of beginning motion, is not <HI>in it&s;elf</HI> an impo&s;&s;ible thing; becau&s;e it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity <HI>be</HI> in the &s;upreme cau&s;e: So neither is it impo&s;&s;ible to be <HI>communicated</HI> to created beings. The rea&s;on is plain: Becau&s;e no powers are impo&s;&s;ible to be communicated, but only tho&s;e which imply <HI>&s;elf-exi&s;tence,</HI> and ab&s;olute <HI>indepedency</HI>&mdash;I know, the maintainers of fate are very confident, that a power of beginning motion, is nothing le&s;s than being really independent, or being able to act inde|pendently from any &s;uperior cau&s;e.

I &s;uppo&s;e no con&s;idering man can doubt, but that he actually has al&s;o a power of <HI>&s;elf-motion.</HI> For the ar|guments drawn from continual <HI>experience</HI> and ob&s;erva|tion, to prove that we <HI>have</HI> &s;uch a power, are &s;o &s;trong, that nothing le&s;s than a &s;trict demon&s;tration that the thing is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, and implies an expre&s;s contradiction, can make us in the lea&s;t doubt that we have it not. We have all the &s;ame experience, the &s;ame marks and evidence exactly of our having real|ly a power of <HI>&s;elf-motion;</HI> as the mo&s;t rigid fatali&s;t could po&s;&s;ibly contrive to require, if he was to make the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ition</HI> of a man's being endued with that pow|er.

Wherefore to affirm, notwith&s;tanding all this, that the &s;pirits, by which a man moves the mem|bers of his body, and ranges the thoughts of his mind, are them&s;elves moved wholly by air or &s;ub|tler matter in&s;pired into the body; and that again by other external matter, and &s;o on; as the wheels of a clock are moved by the weights, and tho&s;e weights by gravitation, and &s;o on; without a man's having the lea&s;t power, by any <HI>principle within him&s;elf,</HI> to think any one thought, or impel his own &s;pirits in order to move any member of his body: All this is &s;o contrary to experience and the rea&s;on of things, that unle&s;s the idea of <HI>&s;elf-motion</HI> were in it&s;elf as evidently and clearly a <HI>contradiction,</HI> as that two and two &s;hould make five, a man ought to, be a&s;hamed to talk at that rate. Nay, a man of any con&s;idera|ble degree of mode&s;ty, would even in that ca&s;e be al|mo&s;t tempted rather to doubt the truth of his facul|ties, than take upon him to a&s;&s;ert one &s;uch intolera|ble ab&s;urdity, merely for the avoiding of another. There are &s;ome indeed, who denying men the pow|er of <HI>beginning motion,</HI> would yet &s;eem in &s;ome man|ner to account for their actions, by allowing them a power of <HI>determining</HI> motion. But this al&s;o is a mere ludicrous trifling with words. For if that power of <HI>determining</HI> motion, be no other in a man, than that which is in a &s;tone to reflect a ball <HI>one certain way,</HI> this is ju&s;t nothing at all. But if he has a power of determining the motion of his &s;pirits <HI>any way,</HI> as he him&s;elf plea&s;es; this is in all re&s;pects the very &s;ame as <HI>the power of beginning motion.'</HI></P></NOTE></P>

man, nor the angels that fell, had a moral ability at fir&s;t to continue in a &s;tate of rectitude, to whom but their Creator mu&s;t their fall be at|tributed?

Their abilities, relations, and de&s;tination being &s;uch as their great Former gave and intended, they could be an&s;werable only for what was given. If, therefore, the fir&s;t act of &s;in 'nece&s;&s;arily followed from GOD's withhold|ing a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or if that a&s;&s;i&s;tance was not afford|ed, which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the avoid|ing' the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, what is this but mak|ing GOD the proper author of it?

there is no need of our examining into any <HI>moral impotency</HI> derived from the fall, or the moral inability of <HI>fallen</HI> man.

That the whole &s;eries of events is connected with &s;omething in the &s;tate of things, either po&s;itive or nega|tive, which is original in the &s;eries; i. e. &s;omething which is connected with nothing preceeding that, but GOD's own IMMEDIATE conduct'&mdash;and in re|gard 'to the &s;tate and acts of the will, EVERY event of this kind is nece&s;&s;ary by a moral nece&s;&s;ity' &mdash;(p. 402, 403, 405, 406) 'The will always has an in|ability to act otherwi&s;e than it does'; (p. 35) that is, the man, or agent, or &s;oul&mdash;'for the faculty of will doth not act, but the agent that hath it.' GOD does deci&s;ively in his providence deter|mine all the volitions and actions of moral agents, either by po&s;itive influence or permi&s;&s;ion&mdash;meaning by permi&s;&s;ion, not only 'the not hindering &s;in, but di&s;po&s;ing the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of things in &s;uch a manner, that &s;in certainly and infallibly fol|lows from his di&s;po&s;al&mdash; that GOD, <HI>when he had made man, &s;o ordered his circum&s;tances, that from the&s;e circum&s;tances, together with the withholding divine in|fluence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, his &s;in infallibly followed.</HI>' (p. 376)</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;in of angels and man was then morally nece&s;&s;ary, and proceeded from their original &s;tate and circum&s;tances&mdash;from GOD's withholding nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And this proves their original moral inability; which inability being 'connected with no|thing preceeding, BUT GOD's OWN IMMEDIATE CONDUCT, which is ORIGINAL <HI>in the &s;eries,</HI>' he mu&s;t be the <HI>author</HI> of it. For if he him&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated them to &s;in, by doing or forbearing what rendered the fir&s;t &s;in unavoidable&mdash;if &s;in followed from his ordering and di&s;po&s;al, that maxim in philo&s;ophy is &s;trictly applicable, '<HI>Cau&s;a deficiens, in rebus nece&s;&s;a|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">s; not cau&s;am por&s;a efficientem reducenda e&s;t.</HI> In things nece&s;&s;ary, the deficient cau&s;e mu&s;t be reduced to the efficient.

<P>WE readily grant, there can be no act of choice without &s;ome motive or induce|ment. But if what hath been ob&s;erved, with re&s;pect to the power of creatures made upright to retain or forfeit their innocence, be admitted, it clearly follows, that the application of com|mands, invitations, monitions, &amp;c. is con&s;i&s;tent with a freedom to <HI>either</HI> &s;ide. For who que&s;ti|ons but rebel angels had the highe&s;t induce|ments, before their fall, to abide in their fir&s;t e&s;tate? We need not &s;cruple to &s;ay, the &s;trong|e&s;t po&s;&s;ible motives could not be wanting in the pre&s;ence of GOD&mdash;that it was the highe&s;t <HI>apparent</HI> good, as well as their highe&s;t duty, and what they had a moral ability for, to continue &s;ubject to the great Creator. And it is really one of the mo&s;t inexplicable events, that beings in their &s;ituation &s;hould fall. This event &s;hews, beyond que&s;tion, that a liberty to either &s;ide is con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t powerful motives to bi|as and incline the will to one &s;ide.</P>
<P>SO in the ca&s;e of innocent <HI>Adam,</HI> no one will &s;ay, that the motives in paradi&s;e, to hold fa&s;t his integrity, were in&s;ufficient&mdash;or that their not proving effectual nece&s;&s;arily proceeded from the
<PB N="110" REF="011623_0122_0F8775CB1CE5E748">
original, moral &s;tate of his will, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the moral image of GOD. That he had a moral capacity to &s;u&s;tain the federal trial is here taken for granted. Among other commands, writ|ten on his heart, or communicated by &s;pecial intercour&s;e with Deity, he had one prohibition properly po&s;itive, which was made the te&s;t of his fidelity, accompanied with an expre&s;s threat, that he &s;hould die in ca&s;e of non-forbearance in that in&s;tance; and implying a promi&s;e of life, if he refrained in this article. Whatever be un|der&s;tood by the death threatened, the threaten|ing was &s;ufficiently awful. Yet again&s;t the cleare&s;t warning, again&s;t the highe&s;t motives to the contrary, he ventured to take and eat. Com|mands, invitations, promi&s;es, admonitions, &amp;c. are therefore con&s;i&s;tent with a moral ability to hearken or not hearken to them.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;ame rea&s;on that <HI>&s;in</HI> could not be mo|rally nece&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t, it will be difficult to prove, that the continued <HI>holine&s;s</HI> of good angels was morally nece&s;&s;ary from the beginning. Mr. <HI>Ed|wards</HI> &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e a difference as to the <HI>degree</HI> of moral nece&s;&s;ity; but expre&s;sly main|tains, that the <HI>reality</HI> of it is the &s;ame in all in|&s;tances.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part III.

<P>FARTHER, with regard to fallen man, Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> allows, that commands, &amp;c. are given to, and means u&s;ed with &s;inners, in unregene|racy. From hence he partly argues his doctrine

of nece&s;&s;ity.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid, and Sect. 7. and p. 384.</NOTE> They have a moral under&s;tand|ing, and the &s;ame natural powers of action, with holy and good men&mdash;To which end moral in|ducements of various kinds are laid before them.</P>
<P>THE doctrine of nece&s;&s;ary connection of means and ends, as &s;tated by Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> implies one or other of the following things: Either that no means are employed with the unregenerate in order to their conver&s;ion&mdash;or none that have a tendency to the end&mdash;or that they have not a moral power of u&s;ing them&mdash;or their u&s;e of them is certainly and infallibly &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>means are u&s;ed with unregenerate &s;in|ners,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> grants. But &s;ince the doc|trine he defends may &s;eem to imply, that means are never u&s;ed with the finally impenitent, (at lea&s;t not to bring them to repentance, but only to confirm them in wickedne&s;s, and lead them to de&s;truction) we &s;hall ju&s;t hint, that the whole oeconomy of providence and grace is a means u&s;ed with the righteous and wicked in common, for the confirmation, improvement and comfort of the former, and conviction and reformation of the latter. Extraordinary and ordinary means are u&s;ed to this end. Of the former kind are miracles, prophecy, tongues, vouch&s;afed at &s;pe|cial &s;ea&s;ons, and in divers manners; together with &s;ingular and alarming interpo&s;itions of pro|vidence. To the latter kind belong a written, &s;tanding revelation, a public mini&s;try and in&s;ti|tutions of wor&s;hip, the &s;trivings of the divine &s;pirit, various providential allotments &amp;c. The word of truth in particular is an external ap|pointed

means of regeneration, repentance from dead works, convertion, or that faith by which tho&s;e live who are pa&s;&s;ed from death to life. If any reject the tender of &s;alvation, the me&s;&s;en|gers of it are directed to wipe off the du&s;t of their feet as a te&s;timony again&s;t the de&s;pi&s;ers of their me&s;&s;age; leaving with them this &s;olemn prote&s;tation, 'Be ye &s;ure of this, that the king|dom of GOD is come unto you.' We might mention the patience of GOD towards &s;inners, &amp;c.&mdash;whence it is apparent that means, power|ful means, are u&s;ed for the conver&s;ion even of tho&s;e, who are at length re&s;igned up to their own hearts lu&s;t. But as this matter appears not to be conte&s;ted by Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> we &s;hall pa&s;s to the next thing above mentioned.</P>
<P>WHETHER the means u&s;ed with the unregen|erate have any <HI>tendency</HI> to the end? The very propo&s;ing of this que&s;tion is enough. For when|ever we u&s;e the <HI>means,</HI> it is in relation to &s;ome end. We intend by it the <HI>media</HI> through which any end is attained. So that to &s;peak of means, and deny their conducivene&s;s to the end, is an affront to common &s;en&s;e, as nothing can properly be called a means farther than it hath, or is &s;uppo&s;ed to have, a tendency to accompli&s;h an end. And as all who maintain there are any in&s;tituted means of conver&s;ion, allow them to have been ordained by infinite wi&s;dom, it would be impeaching &s;u|preme wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s to &s;ay, they are not calculated <HI>in the be&s;t manner</HI> to lead &s;inners to re|pentance.</P>
<P>NOT that any external means are efficacious in them&s;elves, but only through the divine concur|rence with them. So it is in temporal and world|ly
<PB N="113" REF="011623_0125_0F8775D122590F70">
matters; and &s;o it is in the concerns of re|ligion. Means and endeavors do not en&s;ure worldly &s;ucce&s;s. They are in vain except GOD worketh with them. Yet who he&s;itates one mo|ment, whether the divine concurrence is to be expected in the u&s;e, and through the in&s;trumen|tality, of the means he hath pre&s;cribed, or the contrary? Exempt ca&s;es there are wherein means are &s;uper&s;eded in mens temporal affairs: There may be like in&s;tances in the affairs of &s;alvation. But the&s;e being <HI>exempt</HI> ca&s;es is a rea&s;on why &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings are much rather to be expected in the u&s;e, than in the neglect of means.</P>
<P>IT is the united voice of all Calvini&s;tic divines, that there is the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible encouragement to the endeavours of unconverted men in the u&s;e of the means of &s;alvation. Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> al|lows, that moral inducements are u&s;ed with them; and &s;ays, 'it is of the nature of &s;uch in|ducements, that they have &s;omething <HI>inviting,</HI> &s;ome tendency to <HI>induce</HI> and <HI>di&s;po&s;e</HI> to virtuous volition; to give the mind an <HI>inclination or bias</HI> to virtue&mdash;that they can operate only by bia&s;&s;ing the will, and giving it a certain inclination one way&mdash;(p. 119, 125.) that motives have in them|&s;elves this nature and tendency in different de|grees, &s;ome greater, others le&s;s.' Now by Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s principles every inclination, however weak, is of the nature of a di&s;po&s;ition to virtue, and leading to it. (For there can be no induce|ments to virtue but &s;uch as operate by giving the mind an inclination to it) If then the motives u&s;ed with the unregenerate may excite a virtu|ous inclination, though in the <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> degree, we may, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, &s;uppo&s;e this inclination increa&s;ed to than degree as to become <HI>prepollent,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="011623_0126_0F8775D1E524A6D8">
through the influence of moral means and in|ducements, in &s;ubordination to him who wor|keth all in all. And in proportion to the pre|ponderation of the mind in favor of virtue, is the degree of virtue. How con&s;i&s;tent the&s;e things are with Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s 4th and 5th Sect. part 3d. and other things &s;aid in his book, tho&s;e may judge, who will be at the pains to examine and compare them.</P>
<P>IF it be &s;aid, in the next place, that the un|regenerate have not a <HI>moral power to u&s;e the means of grace:</HI> This is the &s;ame ab&s;urdity as to &s;ay, the means have no tendency to the end. For how can means be &s;aid to be afforded, which cannot be u&s;ed? At be&s;t, they are as if not af|forded. How then can the go&s;pel be preached for a <HI>witne&s;s</HI> to &s;uch as finally reject it? Why is it taken from &s;ome, becau&s;e they bring not forth the fruit of the kingdom, when they never had it in their power to receive its te&s;timony? Can they be liable to an aggravated puni&s;hment for not u&s;ing means, which they could not improve to any purpo&s;e? We repeat it to prevent mi&s;takes that when we &s;peak of the ability of unregenerate men to u&s;e the means of grace, we mean not an in|dependent power in them&s;elves: (This the <HI>regenerate</HI> have not) But that &s;uch influences of grace are vouch&s;afed, together with external means, as that tho&s;e might embrace the go&s;pel call, who, in event, reject it again&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, there is a wide difference in the characters of unregenerate men. Some &s;uch are <HI>nearer</HI> the kingdom of GOD than others. There is more hope of &s;ome than others of this cha|racter

&mdash;Which things cannot be &s;aid con&s;i&s;tent|ly with the &s;uppo&s;ition of unregenerate men's being utterly incapable of any good effect from the means of grace, through their own endea|vours in the u&s;e of them, and the common &s;tri|vings of GOD's &s;pirit. And yet, what le&s;s is implied in the a&s;&s;ertion, that they cannot u&s;e the means that are employed with them, cannot improve a &s;uppo&s;ed price in their hands?

<P>TO &s;ay la&s;tly, that the endeavours of the unre|generate in the u&s;e of the means of grace are infal|libly connected with <HI>&s;ucce&s;s,</HI> is to &s;ay, that no means are employed with tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins; contrary to what Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> expre&s;sly al|lows. And yet he mu&s;t either &s;ay this, or el&s;e that none but the regenerate can u&s;e the means of grace. We may ju&s;t as well affirm, that all converted men mu&s;t profit <HI>equally</HI> under the means of &s;alvation, as that none can improve them at all but they who &s;ucceed. One may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that &s;uch as hear the word, and anon with joy receive it, u&s;e the means of grace, though they &s;hould endure but a while.</P>

different per&s;ons; which is the true ground (ordinarily) of their different &s;ucce&s;s.

Now temptations and allurements to &s;in 'operate by giving the mind an inclination to it&mdash;bia&s;&s;ing the will this way.' So that as inducements to holi|ne&s;s may be con&s;i&s;tently u&s;ed with tho&s;e who at pre&s;ent are under the dominion of &s;in, with a pro&s;pect of changing their pre&s;ent prevailing bi|as and inclination; allurements to &s;in may al&s;o

be laid before tho&s;e who&s;e prevailing bias is to holine&s;s, not without a po&s;&s;ibility and pro&s;pect of their being overcome&mdash;with which view they are always propo&s;ed by the tempter. <HI>Adam,</HI> en|dowed with the moral image of GOD, was over|come: And are his fallen &s;ons exempt from danger? The regenerate fall from virtue fre|quently through inadvertence, and the &s;trength of a pre&s;ent temptation. They are, therefore, under no moral nece&s;&s;ity of being <HI>perfect,</HI> nor in|deed can be free from &s;in in this life. Or will any undertake to &s;hew, that the &s;ins they fall in|to are morally nece&s;&s;ary? According to Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s doctrine they are &s;o indeed. To &s;up|po&s;e farther, as his doctrine doth, that the <HI>im|perfect</HI> holine&s;s of the &s;aints in this life is nece&s;|&s;ary by a moral nece&s;&s;ity, is a palpable contra|diction: For &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity being &s;uppo&s;ed would prove them incapable of any lap&s;e what|ever. Nece&s;&s;ity is <HI>fixed</HI> and <HI>uniform,</HI> admitting of no <HI>variety or di&s;&s;onancy</HI> of character: Where|as the moral characters of good chri&s;tians are mixed, and in many in&s;tances contradictory. <HI>David</HI>'s murther and adultery were very incon|&s;i&s;tent with his general character, and cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been morally nece&s;&s;ary, con|&s;i&s;tent with the opinion, that by the &s;ame nece&s;|&s;ity he was a man after GOD's own heart.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, powerful motives to holi|ne&s;s, joined with a prevailing propen&s;ity this way are yet to be found where there are in many in|&s;tances contrary volitions; and in &s;ome in&s;tan|ces, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, to an high degree. Nor have the maintainers of the doctrine of the &s;aints per&s;everance been wont to ground it on the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>indefectibility</HI> of the &s;piritual princi|ple in them, in it&s;elf con&s;idered, but on the <HI>co|venant and power</HI> of GOD engaged to them.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="011623_0131_0F8775D7362F23B8">Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that &s;ome crimes are <HI>more heinous</HI> than others in their own nature: Nor would he deny, but that of &s;ome <HI>more</HI> is required than of others. We may a&s;k, On what ground? if all volition and action is nece&s;&s;ary, in the &s;en&s;e of his book. How is a 'per&s;on under previous obligation to con&s;ider beforehand in &s;ome ca&s;es more than others?' (p. 262) Can he con&s;ider without motives to con&s;ideration pre&s;ented to his mind?

The whole con|trover&s;y, in a manner, terms on the re&s;olution of the&s;e que&s;tions. Every reader perceives on which &s;ide Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> was in regard to them: And every reader, 'from the bare propo&s;al of them, may &s;ee at once, whether or no, or how far Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s doctrine is reconcileable with the &s;uppo&s;ition of <HI>different degrees</HI> of guilt, and obligations to con&s;ider previous to making choice.

<HEAD><HI>SECT. III.</HI> Allowing Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity to be true in <HI>theory,</HI> it is not applicable to <HI>practice.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS we have &s;uppo&s;ed the doctrine of nece&s;&s;i|ty maintained in Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s enquiry runs up to <HI>ab&s;olute fatality,</HI> we &s;hall in this &s;ecti|on con&s;ider it in this view. We &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity to be indeed agreable to philo|&s;ophic truth. Taking for granted the coinci|dence between Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and a &s;trict fatali&s;t, Dr. <HI>Butler</HI>'s rea&s;oning with the latter is in a good mea&s;ure applicable to the former. We &s;hall ac|cordingly take the liberty to extract from the chapter of his analogy, entitled, 'Of the opinion of nece&s;&s;ity, con&s;idered as influencing <HI>practice.</HI>' He introduces what he there ob&s;erves with this apology to his readers: 'As the puzzle and ob|&s;curity, which mu&s;t unavoidably ari&s;e from ar|guing upon &s;o ab&s;urd a &s;uppo&s;ition as that of uni|ver&s;al nece&s;&s;ity, will, I fear, ea&s;ily be &s;een; it will, I hope, as ea&s;ily be excu&s;ed.'</P>
<P>WHEN it is &s;aid by a fatali&s;t, that the whole con&s;titution of nature, and the actions of men, that every thing, and every mode and circum|&s;tance of every thing, is nece&s;&s;ary and could not po&s;&s;ibly have been otherwi&s;e; it is to be ob&s;er|ved, that this nece&s;&s;ity does not exclude delibe|ration, choice, preference, and acting from cer|tain principles, and to certain ends: Becau&s;e all this is matter oi undoubted experience, acknow|ledged by all, and what every man may, every moment, be con&s;cious of. And hence it follows,
<PB N="121" REF="011623_0133_0F8775DB38C4E9C8">
that nece&s;&s;ity, alone and of it&s;elf, is in no &s;ort an account of the con&s;titution of nature, and how things came <HI>to be</HI> and <HI>to continue</HI> as they are, but only an account of this <HI>circum&s;tance,</HI> relating to their origin and continuance, that they could not have been otherwi&s;e than they are and have been.</P>
<P>NECESSITY as much requires and &s;uppo&s;es a nece&s;&s;ary agent, as freedom requires and &s;uppo|&s;es a free agent, to be the former of the world. And the appearances of <HI>de&s;ign</HI> and of <HI>final cau&s;es</HI> in the con&s;titution of nature, as really prove this acting agent, to be an <HI>intelligent</HI> de&s;igner, or to act from choice, upon the &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;i|ty, &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ible, as upon that of freedom.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE then a fatali&s;t to educate any one, from his youth up, in his own principles, that the child &s;hould rea&s;on upon them, and conclude that &s;ince he cannot po&s;&s;ibly behave otherwi&s;e than he does, he is not a &s;ubject of blame or commendation, nor can de&s;erve to be rewarded or puni&s;hed: Imagine him to eradicate the very perceptions of blame and commendation out of his mind, by means of this &s;y&s;tem; to form his temper, and character, and behaviour to it; and from it to judge of the treatment he was to expect, &s;ay, from rea&s;onable men, upon his coming abroad into the world&mdash;I cannot for|bear &s;topping here to a&s;k, Whether anyone of com|mon &s;en&s;e would think fit, that a child &s;hould be put upon the&s;e &s;peculations, and be left to apply them to practice? And a man has little pretence to rea&s;on, who is not &s;en&s;ible, that we are all children in &s;peculations of this kind. However, the child would doubtle&s;s be highly delighted to find him&s;elf freed from the re&s;traints of fear and &s;hame, with which his play-fellows were fettered
<PB N="122" REF="011623_0134_0F8775DC16AC5DF8">
and embarra&s;&s;ed; and highly conceited in his &s;u|perior knowledge &s;o far beyond his years. But conceit and vanity would be the lea&s;t bad part of the influence, which the&s;e principles mu&s;t have, when thus rea&s;oned and acted upon, during the cour&s;e of his education. He mu&s;t either be allowed to go on, and be the plague of all about him, and him&s;elf too, even to his own de|&s;truction: Or el&s;e correction mu&s;t be continual|ly made u&s;e of, to &s;upply the want of tho&s;e na|tural perceptions of blame and commendation, which we have &s;uppo&s;ed to be removed; and to give him a practical impre&s;&s;ion, of what he had rea&s;oned him&s;elf out of the belief of, that he was in fact an accountable child, and to be puni&s;hed for doing what he was forbid. It is therefore in reality impo&s;&s;ible, but that the cor|rection which he mu&s;t meet with, in the cour&s;e of his education, mu&s;t convince him, that if the &s;cheme he was in&s;tructed in were not fal&s;e; yet that he rea&s;oned inconclu&s;ively upon it, and &s;ome how or other mi&s;applied it to practice and common life. But &s;uppo&s;ing the child's temper could remain &s;till formed to the &s;y&s;tem, and his expec|tation of the treatment he was to have in the world be regulated by it; &s;o as to expect that no rea&s;onable man would blame or puni&s;h him, for any thing which he &s;hould do, becau&s;e he could not help doing it: Upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, it is mainife&s;t he would, upon his coming abroad in|to the world, be in&s;upportable to &s;ociety, and the treatment he would receive from it, would ren|der it &s;o to him; and he could not fail of doing &s;omewhat, very &s;oon, for which he would be deli|vered over into the hands of civil ju&s;tice. And thus, in the end, he would be convinced of the obli|gations he was under to his wi&s;e in&s;tructor. Or
<PB N="123" REF="011623_0135_0F8775DC63ACE770">
&s;uppo&s;e this &s;cheme of fatality, in any other way, applied to practice, &s;uch practical application of it will be found equally ab&s;urd; equally fal|lacious in a practical &s;en&s;e: For in&s;tance, that if a man be de&s;tined to live &s;uch a time, he &s;hall live to it, though he take no care of his own pre&s;ervation; or if he be de&s;tined to die before that time, no care can prevent it. Therefore all care to pre&s;erve one's own life is to be ne|glected, which is the fallacy in&s;tanced in by the ancients.</P>
<P>BUT now on the contrary, none of the&s;e prac|tical ab&s;urdities can be drawn, from rea&s;oning upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that we are free, but all &s;uch rea&s;oning with regard to the common af|fairs of life, is ju&s;tified by experience. And therefore, though it were admitted that this opi|nion of nece&s;&s;ity were &s;peculatively true; yet, with regard to practice, it is as if it were fal&s;e, &s;o far as our experience reacheth; that is, to the whole of our pre&s;ent life. For, the con&s;titu|tion of the world, and the condition in which we are actually placed, is, as if we were free. And it may perhaps ju&s;tly be concluded, that &s;ince the whole proce&s;s of action, through every &s;tep of it, &s;u&s;pen&s;e, deliberation, inclining one way, determining, and at la&s;t doing as we determine; is as if we were free, therefore we are &s;o. But the thing here in&s;i&s;ted on is, that under the pre&s;ent natural government of the world, we find we are treated and dealt with, as if we were free, prior to all con&s;ideration whether we are or not. Were this opinion therefore of nece&s;&s;ity admitted to be ever &s;o true; yet &s;uch is in fact our condition and the natural cour&s;e of things, that whenever we apply it to life and practice,
<PB N="124" REF="011623_0136_0F8775DD1CD92D78">
this application of it always mi&s;leads us, and can|not but mi&s;lead us, in a mo&s;t dreadful manner, with regard to our pre&s;ent intere&s;t. And how can people think them&s;elves &s;o very &s;ecure then, that the &s;ame application of the &s;ame opinion may not mi&s;lead them al&s;o, in &s;ome analogous man|ner, with re&s;pect to a future, a more general and more important intere&s;t? For religion being a practical &s;ubject; and the analogy of nature &s;hewing us, that we have not faculties to apply this opinion, were it a true one, to practical &s;ub|jects; whenever we do apply it to the &s;ubject of religion, and thence conclude that we are free from its obligations, it is plain this conclu&s;ion cannot be depended upon.</P>
<P>THE notion of nece&s;&s;ity, with re&s;pect to prac|tical &s;ubjects, therefore is as it were not true. Nor doth this contain any reflection upon rea|&s;on; but only upon what is unrea&s;onable. For to pretend to act upon rea&s;on, in oppo&s;ition to practical principles, which the author of our na|ture gave us to act upon; and to pretend to ap|ply our rea&s;on to &s;ubjects, with regard to which, our own &s;hort views, and even our experience, will &s;hew us, it cannot be depended upon; and &s;uch, at be&s;t, the &s;ubject of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be; this is vanity, conceit and unrea&s;onablene&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all. For we find within our|&s;elves a will, and are con&s;cious of a character. Now if this, in us, be reconcileable with fate, it is reconcileable with it, in the author of nature. And be&s;ides, natural government and final cau&s;es imply a character and a will in the governor and de&s;igner; a will concerning the creatures whom he governs. The author of nature then being
<PB N="125" REF="011623_0137_0F8775DDDCCB0860">
certainly of &s;ome character or other, notwith|&s;tanding nece&s;&s;ity; it is evident this nece&s;&s;ity is as reconcileable with the particular character of benevolence, veracity, and ju&s;tice in him, which attributes are the foundation of religion, as with any other character: Sure we find this nece&s;&s;ity no more hinders <HI>men</HI> from being benevolent than cruel; true, than faultle&s;s; ju&s;t than un|ju&s;t.</P>
<P>WE find GOD exerci&s;es the &s;ame kind of go|vernment over us, with that a father exerci&s;es over his children, and a civil magi&s;trate over his &s;ubjects. Now, whatever becomes of ab&s;tract que&s;tions concerning liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, it evi|dently appears to us, that veracity and ju&s;tice mu&s;t be the natural rule and mea&s;ure of exerci&s;ing this government or authority, to a being, who can have no competitions, or interfering of intere&s;ts, with his creatures and his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>WE have endeavoured to keep in view the de|&s;ign we mentioned in the introduction, to examine only the <HI>ground-work</HI> of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s book with|out entering into con&s;ideration of the particular doctrines built thereupon. Whether they &s;tand or fall with the foundation, is be&s;ide our purpo&s;e to &s;ay&mdash;Or whether what has been offered at all weakens this foundation is not for us to deter|mine. One thing, perhaps, appears, that men of &s;trong powers and great abilities are wont to wade beyond their depth, and bewilder them|&s;elves and others with &s;peculations ab&s;tru&s;e and unprofitable&mdash;to &s;ay no wor&s;e. Great geniu&s;es are fruitful, many times, of great errors. There is a &s;hew of &s;cience, fal&s;ely &s;o called, which is
<PB N="126" REF="011623_0138_0F8775DEF6320218">
e&s;pecially incongruous in handling moral and re|ligious &s;ubjects; wherein the &s;imple (who make much the greater part of mankind) are alike concerned as the wi&s;e and learned&mdash;and which, therefore, ought to be treated with the utmo&s;t plainne&s;s.</P>
<P>WE do not deny but Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> was 'wor|thy of the name of a <HI>Philo&s;opher:'</HI> (p. 401) But we appeal to the publick, whether &s;ome of the mo&s;t famed Philo&s;ophers in the Engli&s;h nation, for many years back, and at this day, have not philo&s;ophi&s;ed them&s;elves into &s;ceptici&s;m? One of fir&s;t di&s;tinction in particular (who&s;e e&s;&s;ays on &s;ome moral &s;ubjects are &s;o nearly akin to Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> on nece&s;&s;ity, that a reader might think the latter copied from the former) appears plain|ly to be a di&s;believer in natural religion, not le&s;s than revealed. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hume</HI>'s e&s;&s;ay, Vol. III. Sect. 7, 8, 10, 11. &amp;c.</NOTE> However, we have not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s inclination ei|ther to athei&s;m or dei&s;m. We doubt not he had a &s;trong practical &s;en&s;e of religion, which overbalanced his theory. But when great di&s;|putants are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a particular hypothe&s;is, they are apt to defend it many times by a me|thod of rea&s;oning, which leads to mo&s;t danger|ous con&s;equences&mdash;without &s;eeing or allowing tho&s;e con&s;equences, which, if fairly deduced, demon&s;trate the hypothe&s;is it&s;elf to be wrong, or that they have argued wrong from it.</P>
<P>IF we have mi&s;repre&s;ented Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> it has not been through de&s;ign; nor have we knowingly 'in&s;i&s;ted on difficulties not belong|ing to the controver&s;y.' Whether our 'indig|nation

or di&s;dain' hath been 'rai&s;ed at the &s;ight of his di&s;cour&s;e,' others mu&s;t be left to judge. No one, we may pre&s;ume, will &s;ay, that much pains have been u&s;ed to '&s;et forth' the doctrines of his book 'in colours &s;hocking to the imagi|nations, and moving to the pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e, who have either too little capacity, or too much con|fidence of the opinions they have imbibed, and contempt of the contrary, to try the matter by any &s;erious and circum&s;pect examination.' Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> it &s;eems, was aware of being charged with maintaining 'horrid and bla&s;|phemous doctrines, the fate of the heathen, <HI>Hobbs</HI>'s nece&s;&s;ity, making men meer machines,' &amp;c. Whether he had any rea&s;on to apprehend &s;uch an indictment is a matter we refer to the reader: To who&s;e judgment we al&s;o &s;ubmit the following propo&s;ed &s;pecimen of the coincidence between Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s doctrines, and tho&s;e of &s;ome celebrated infidels.</P>

<P>THE a&s;&s;erters of univer&s;al fate had different notions about it. <HI>Diodorus</HI> and <HI>Democritus</HI> were of the <HI>atomical</HI> &s;ect, who made every thing the nece&s;&s;ary effect of the eternal motion and concour&s;e of atoms, &s;uppo&s;ing an ex|ternal chain of <HI>effects,</HI> without any original <HI>cau&s;e</HI> or <HI>agent</HI> at all. <HI>Heraclitus</HI> derived every thing from the <HI>fir&s;t cau&s;e</HI> of the univer&s;e as the <HI>efficient,</HI> &s;tiling it <HI>fate;</HI> and &s;uppo&s;ing not only all other things which exi&s;t, but <HI>the purpo&s;es of our minds</HI> al&s;o, proceed from the effici|ent power of it&mdash;Which was making no agent in the world but the &s;upreme cau&s;e, and human actions no|thing but the operations of GOD in men, actuating them, and every thing el&s;e, as the &s;oul doth the body.</P>
<P>The <HI>a&s;trological</HI> notion of fate was, that every thing was effected by the circumvolution of the univer&s;e, and the po&s;itions and appearances of the planets and fixed &s;tars.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="011623_0142_0F8775F866D96F40">ANOTHER notion of fatality was founded in the &s;up|po&s;ition of a <HI>mutual, eternal concatenation and chain of cau|&s;es</HI> whereby things po&s;terior always follow tho&s;e which are antecedent, and are re&s;olved into them, as exi&s;ting by them, and <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> con&s;equent to tho&s;e which pre|cede them.

<P>THE will in every in|&s;tance acts by moral nece&s;|&s;ity, (p. 230) and always has an inability to act o|therwi&s;e than it doth; (p. 35) men are morally un|able to will otherwi&s;e than they do will, as really, truly, and properly in one in&s;tance as another: yet the nece&s;&s;ity of the will never renders any thing

improperly the &s;ubject of command. The oppo&s;iti|on or defect of the will in that which is <HI>its original and determining act,</HI> implies a moral inability. This inability alone (which con&s;i&s;ts in di&s;inclination) never can excu&s;e any per|&s;on. (Part iii, &s;ect. iv) In moral nece&s;&s;ity, the connection between cau&s;e and effect is prior and &s;u|perior to will and endea|vour. (P. 294) In a &s;eries of acts, if there are five, ten, an hundred, or a thou|&s;and acts in the train, and the fir&s;t not determined by the will, none of them are. (P. 48, 224, 225, 256, 257) <HI>The e&s;&s;ence of virtue and vice is not in their cau&s;e, but in their na|ture.</HI></P>
<P>PART iv, &s;ect. ix, x. And p. 402, 408, Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> chargeth the de|niers of nece&s;&s;ity with vir|tually &s;aying, that GOD's will and de&s;ire is infinite|ly cro&s;s'd in every act of &s;in, provided moral evil is not for the be&s;t&mdash;that liberty, as oppo&s;ed to nece&s;&s;ity, argues an inferiority and &s;ervitude unworthy of the &s;upream Being; really &s;ubjects the will of the Mo&s;t High to the will of his creatures, and brings him into a de|pendence on them.

<P><PB N="138" REF="011623_0150_0F87760266D3AE98">UNLESS his &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity be admitted, Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> &s;ays it will fol|low, that GOD mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to be con&s;tantly changing his mind and in|tentions as to his future conduct; altering his mea|&s;ures, relinqui&s;hing his old de&s;igns, and forming new &s;chemes and projections&mdash; continually putting his &s;y&s;tem to rights, as it gets out of order, and liable to be wholly fru&s;trated of his end in the creation of the world.

<P>ON the &s;cheme of &s;elf-determination, the will of man is left to the guidance of nothing but blind con|tingence: So that if it makes any difference between men and machines, it is for the wor&s;e; for machines are guided by an under&s;tand|ing cau&s;e, by the &s;kilful hand of the workman or owner.

<P>UPON the whole: One of the famous objections of the <HI>fatali&s;ts</HI> of old to the liberty of human actions, and which is urged for nece&s;&s;ity by modern infidels, was, that every action re&s;ults from a <HI>precedent motive or rea|&s;on,</HI> which rea&s;on or motive is <HI>out of our power.</HI> (<HI>Jack|&s;on</HI>'s an&s;wer to <HI>Cato,</HI> p. 100.) We need not produce any pa&s;&s;age from Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> to &s;hew the coincidence. His whole &s;cheme is founded on this principle.</P>
<P>WE fear our quotations have already been too nu|merous, or it were ea&s;y to add to them. We pre&s;ume they have been &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the attentive and impartial in regard to the coincidence we propo&s;ed to exhibit. What pre&s;umption of the fal&s;hood of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s &s;cheme ari&s;eth from it's agreement with the doctrine of tho&s;e who reject the evidence of the chri&s;ti|an revelation, and even believed not (&s;ome of them) in the perfections and moral government of GOD, we &s;hall not &s;ay; though the &s;u&s;picion that it is fallacious, ari&s;ing from the compari&s;on we have made, will not, we tru&s;t, be thought incon&s;iderable, whether it can or can|not be di&s;tinctly perceived where the fallacy lies. Af|ter all, we &s;hould not have troubled the reader with this appendix but for a rea&s;on already a&s;&s;igned. For if his &s;cheme hath the tendency, and is reducible to the con&s;equences, we have attributed to it, all but infidels will allow this to be a full demon&s;tration of it's fal&s;hood. Whether the fallacy of the rea&s;oning of his book can be di&s;tinctly traced, or with what cla&s;s of writers it co|incides, is not the que&s;tion&mdash;But whether the con&s;e|quences are ju&s;tly drawn.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="011623_0152_0F87760B37B0C278">IF any, who may think the 'things which have been alledged worthy of being read, or of &s;o much notice as to &s;ay much about them, &s;hould have their indignation or di&s;dain rai&s;ed,' we can truly &s;ay, that we meant to rai&s;e neither. We &s;at down with a determination to avoid every thing per&s;onal. If we have broken through this determination, it is an inadvertence we cannot re|collect. Whatever we think of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s &s;y&s;tem, we doubt not the goodne&s;s of his heart; and believe he is entered into the reward of a good and faithful &s;ervant, where even great men &s;ee they knew but in part while they tabernacled in fle&s;h, and perhaps entertained &s;ome dangerous errors. For we have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t as to infer the badne&s;s of any man's heart from the fal&s;hood of his &s;peculative opinions.</P>
