<HEAD>REMARKS &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH is the pre&s;ent afflicting Situation of Affairs, and &s;uch the univer&s;al Prevalence of Animo&s;ity, that each Man &s;eems to have obtained his SUMMUM BONUM, when by all the Arts of a <HI>Sophi&s;t,</HI> he can lay hold of any Means, (no Matter how ba&s;e) to wound his Neighbour's Reputation. A re|cent and glaring In&s;tance of this detracting Spirit, we have had in a late &s;candalous Phamph|let, entituled <Q>The Author of QUAKER UNMASK'D &s;trip'd &s;tark naked, or the DELI|NEATED PRESBYTERIAN play'd Hob with;</Q> where a Gentleman of unblemi&s;h'd Morals is openly and audaciou&s;ly in&s;ulted and proclaimed to the World to be an unju&s;t and deceiving Man.</P>
<P>This grovling Performance is written with neither Spirit nor Judgment; and contains nothing to recommend it to the Peru&s;al of any candid, unbigotted Per&s;on, &s;ave that it tends

to &s;hew the malevolent Author of it in his proper Colours; <HI>to wit,</HI> a Di&s;turber of the public Tranquility and a Pe&s;t of Society, But to proceed;&mdash;my De&s;ign, at pre&s;ent, is neither to defend the Conduct of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> nor the <HI>Quakers;</HI> but &s;olely to vindicate that Gen|tleman, from the villainous A&s;per&s;ions of his de&s;igning Enemies; and in this Undertaking, I &s;hall appear ju&s;tifiable in the Eyes of all, un|bia&s;s'd by Prejudice.</P>

<P>Our ingenious Pamphleteer, when he &s;at down to compo&s;e his elaborate and learned Treati&s;e, &s;eems to have intended to do all the Mi&s;chief in his Power; and being regardle&s;s of the &s;acred Laws of Speech, (for he deals in the marvellous) and having no other Method to give Vent to his Malice, he without Rea&s;on or Provocation charges a Per&s;on entirely inno|cent of the Fact, with being the Author of a late Piece, entituled "QUAKER UNMASK'D,"
<PB N="4" REF="009814_0004_0F7A545E274F9D28">and taking it for granted that he was the Man, thence draws this <HI>&s;agacious</HI> and <HI>infallible</HI> In|ference, that therefore he is a Lyer. The Gentleman &s;o gro&s;ly abus'd, was no Doubt &s;uppos'd by our Author, to have wrote the Pamphlet he pretends to animadvert upon; and now nicely does he do it! Fir&s;t with u&s;her|ing in his Lampoon by deriding another Gen|tleman, who&s;e prudent Behaviour in the late unhappy Di&s;turbances, I leave to cooler Times to determine. But that I may detain your At|tentions no longer, &s;hall with all the Brevity po&s;&s;ible, convince you, by a few Remaks on that libellous Lampoon, which I ju&s;t now &s;poke of, that the Author of it hath acted an un|manly and ungenerous Part. If any Man among you (&s;ave <HI>St. James</HI>) &s;eem to be religious and bridleth not his Tongue, but deceiveth his two Heart; this Man's Religion is vain.</P>
<P>What favourable Sentiments can you enter|tain of him, who, upon a bare, groundle&s;s Suppo&s;ition, would endeavour to bla&s;t the Reputation of a fellow Creature? Do not your Hearts tell you, &s;uch a Man as this is and mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be a Villain? &s;urely they do. Why then Mr. <HI>Pamphleteer</HI> labours under this

Di&s;advantage; for his whole Performance is one continued Piece of Detraction. The Faults he lays to the Charge of that Gentle|men of whom he hath had the Impudence to &s;peak &s;o freely, are all invented by Malice, with a De&s;ign to rob him of his hone&s;t Fame; but his Character is too well e&s;tabli&s;h'd to be &s;ullied by the invidious Repre&s;entations of every vagabond Quill-Driver. Our Author accu&s;es him of being a Promoter of Di&s;cord, and a bad Member of Society; but the&s;e are Faults which cannot, with the lea&s;t Appear|ance of Ju&s;tice, be attributed to him; that he has his Failings as a Man I allow: for Imper|fection is the grand Characteri&s;tic of &s;ubluna|ry Beings; and as the Poet &s;ays,</P>
<Q><L>The ruling Pa&s;&s;ion, be it what it will,</L>
<L>The ruling Pa&s;&s;ion governs Nature &s;till.</L></Q>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider what he &s;ays next. <Q>I &s;incerely hope that the Sentiments of Ab|horence of your infamous Piece, which I &s;hall expre&s;s, will be of &s;o much Service to you, that you will never hereafter pro&s;titute your Pen to any &s;uch ba&s;e Purpo&s;es for the &s;ake of any Party whatever at the Expence of
<PB N="6" REF="009814_0006_0F7A545FDB0EE528">
Truth; nor to vindicate the Actions of a Set of Murderers and Rioters, de&s;titute of the Principles of Humanity.</Q> Now &s;uppo&s;ing this Gentleman to have wrote that <HI>infamous Piece,</HI> (the contrary of which I affirm) in what Part of it does he countenance Murderers and Rioters? Is it when he tells us he would, by no means attempt to ju&s;tify the killing of <HI>In|dians</HI> while under the Protection of the Go|vernment? Or was it when we were in &s;uch Confu&s;ion, upon the fir&s;t Alarm, of the <HI>Paxton</HI> People being on the Road arm'd, who&s;e Intentions were not &s;uppos'd to be the be&s;t; at which Time he chearfully offer'd him&s;elf to go meet them, and &s;top their Progre&s;s if po&s;&s;i|ble? Or was it at <HI>Germantown,</HI> when he ex|po&s;tulated, advis'd, threatned and us'd his ut|mo&s;t Intere&s;t to prevail with them to return to their re&s;pective Habitations?&mdash;Thus you &s;ee, we have fairly convicted Mr. <HI>Delineator</HI> of a notorious Fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>Page the &s;eventh he tell us <Q>it is impo&s;&s;ible you can recover your u&s;ual Credit but by a &s;incere and public Acknowledgment, that you were prompted thereto by Envy, Hatred and Malice, and that the Father of Lyes was

your Dictator.</Q>&mdash;I can hardly keep my Pa|tience to hear him talk at &s;o ridiculous a Rate; &s;urely our Author hath not wrote him&s;elf to &s;uch a Pitch of Vanity, as to imagine that his ungrammatical Scribling will de&s;troy the lea&s;t Part of that Gentleman's un&s;potted Fame; his Life and Manners will refute all he hath ad|vanc'd; and with Confidence I &s;ay it, his Vir|tues are full Proof again&s;t all his malicious In|ventions; and for him to undertake to cen&s;ure and condemn the conduct of one &s;o much his &s;uperior, only expo&s;es his own Weakne&s;s and renders him liable to be compar'd to the Pup|py who bark'd at the Moon.</P>
<P>Page the 9th. <Q>I know, from your Youth, that you were capable to excogitate Lyes with a better Grace, than any of your School|mates, who have often employed you to &s;ave their Po&s;teriors from the Ceremony of the Birch.</Q> Concerning this A&s;&s;ertion, I &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay a great deal; &s;ave, that our Pam|phleteer hath paid a greatful Acknowledgement for pa&s;t Favours; for how he comes to be &s;o particularly acquainted with that Gentleman's Benevolence, in &s;aving his School-fellows from a Whipping, unle&s;s Experience hath taught him, I &s;hall not venture to decide.</P>
