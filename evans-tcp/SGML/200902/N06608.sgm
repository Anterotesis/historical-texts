<HEAD>To His Excellency <HI>General AMHERST,</HI> Commander in Chief of His Maje&s;ty's Forces in NORTH-AMERICA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>AS</HI> the Subject of the following Di&s;cour&s;e, is the military Character of the greate&s;t General in &s;acred Hi&s;tory, I imagined there would be a peculiar Propriety in the In&s;cription of it to Your Excellency.</P>
<P>The Sphere in which divine Providence, and the Wi&s;dom of the Nation, have placed You, is very honourable and important; of this the unbounded Expence of the pre&s;ent Operations, commit|ted to your Management; the large Army under your Command, and the vigorous Efforts of the&s;e Colonies to &s;trengthen Your Hands, are the mo&s;t inconte&s;tible Demon&s;trations. The Eyes of anxious Multitudes are fixed upon your Excellency; as under God, the Guardian of their Lives, Privileges and E&s;tates. By Your Wi&s;dom, Valour and military Skill, together with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the brave Troops under your Command, they hope to &s;ee the Encroachments of the Enemy entirely removed, and the Peace, Liberty and Happine&s;s of the&s;e Colonies, e&s;tabli&s;h'd on a glorious and permanent Foundation.</P>
<P>The Welfare of the Church of Chri&s;t, which he has redeemed by his Blood, and the Welfare of a populous, fertile and exten|&s;ive Country, very much depend on the Succe&s;s of tho&s;e Mea&s;ures, of which your Excellency is the <HI>CHIEF PROJECTOR</HI> and <HI>PRIME MOVER:</HI> Nay, let me add, the Glory of the Briti&s;h Name, the Felicity of Nations yet unborn, and all that is valuable in Life, to an Engli&s;h American, are deeply concerned in the Pro&s;perity of <HI>GENERAL AMHERST.</HI></P>
<P>If ever Wi&s;dom, Magnanimity, and great Abilities (and what ever el&s;e is good and valuable in human Nature) were re|quired
<PB N="iii" REF="008383_0003_102F43DF7B49C3D0">
in any Office, it mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be &s;uch an one, as that which Your Excellency &s;u&s;tains.</P>
<P>You will not then (I tru&s;t) be offended with me, for recom|mending to Your Excellency, an Imitation of that celebrated Monarch, who&s;e Character I have briefly hinted at, in the fol|lowing Pages; and e&s;pecially with Regard to his undertaking and executing all his Schemes in a humble Dependance on the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, and his earne&s;t Application to the Throne of Grace, for Courage, Direction and A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>It is recorded of Alexander the Great,
<Q>that he held the Iliads of Homer in great Admiration; laid them under his Pillow when he &s;lept, and read in them on all lei&s;ure Oppor|tunities; and that, finding Achilles to be the great Hero of that Poem, he endeavoured to emulate his Actions, and follow his Steps, as the be&s;t Way to Glory and to Fame:</Q>
But I dare venture to affirm, that your Excellency would act a much wi&s;er Part than Alexander, &s;hould you give that Preference to the Bible, which he gave to the Iliad, and in&s;tead of taking an Achil|les, propo&s;e the Jewi&s;h Monarch for the Model of your Conduct.</P>
<P>The Example of David, as a religious General, has this to recommend it&s;elf above all others, that he was a Per&s;on under the immediate and unerring Direction of Heaven; he was a glo|rious King, an eminent Prophet, of &s;ingular Endowments and exalted Piety; he is di&s;tingui&s;h'd in the Scriptures of eternal Truth, by that mo&s;t honourable of all Titles, the Man after God's own Heart: Your Excellency therefore cannot copy after a more fini&s;h'd Pattern.</P>
<P>In peru&s;ing the Hi&s;tory and Writings of King David, Your Excellency will find, that tho' few Heroes have been more &s;uc|ce&s;sful and accompli&s;h'd than this illu&s;trious Monarch, he con|&s;tantly acted with the utmo&s;t Diffidence of him&s;elf, and the mo&s;t cordial Reliance upon Heaven.</P>
<P>All Events are under the Controul of the &s;upreme Ruler of the Univer&s;e; he can turn the be&s;t concerted Schemes into Fooli&s;h|ne&s;s, and baffle the Attempts of the &s;tronge&s;t earthly or ange|lic Power; 'tis therefore exceeding ju&s;t and proper, that in all
<PB N="iv" REF="008383_0004_102F43E10D72A468">
our Enterprizes (e&s;pecially tho&s;e in which Thou&s;ands are con|cern'd we &s;hould with David, &s;trive to &s;ecure the Favour and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of this All-wi&s;e, this Omnipotent, this tremenduous Being.</P>
<P><HI>YOUR EXCELLENCY</HI> very ju&s;tly receives the univer&s;al Applau&s;e of a grateful People, for the &s;ignal Service you have done your Country: Yet we hope this will not divert you, from &s;eeking the Ble&s;&s;ing of that Providence, to the Smiles of which the Succe&s;s of all Events, are primarily to be a&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the Briti&s;h Colonies, (I doubt not) re|joice in the Appointment of a Gentleman of your Excellency's Merit and Abilities, to the Chief Command of His Maje&s;ty's Forces in America. They reflect on the &s;ucce&s;sful Expedition a|gain&s;t <HI>CAPE-BRETON,</HI> in which your Excellency had the Chief Command, with Sentiments of Gratitude too big to be utter'd: And they ardently wi&s;h, that all Your future Operations may be thus attended with Victory and Joy, with Honour and Safety to your&s;elf, and Glory to his Maje&s;ty's Arms.</P>
<P>May the <HI>LORD OF HOSTS,</HI> in&s;pire your Excellency, with Valour, Prudence and Intrepidity, and animate your Brea&s;t with the Love of your Country, and a di&s;intere&s;ted Zeal to promote her Happine&s;s! May he give you Health of Body, and Vigour of Mind; be your Guide and Support under all the weighty and im|portant Concerns of your Station; pro&s;per all your Mea&s;ures for the public Welfare; protect your Per&s;on in the Day of Battle; di|rect your Coun&s;els, and deliver the Enemy into your Hands; may your Name be glorious in the Briti&s;h Annals, and your Memory precious to the late&s;t Generations: The&s;e, may it plea&s;e your Ex|cellency, are the unfeigned De&s;ires,</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>2</HI> Sam. <HI>xvii. 8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For &s;aid Hu&s;hai, Thou knowe&s;t thy Father and his Men, that they be mighty Men, and they be cha&s;&s;ed in their Minds, as a Bear robbed of her Whelps in the Field; and thy Father is a Man of War, and will not lodge with the People.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IN order to di&s;cover the occa&s;ion upon which the&s;e words were &s;poken, and thus enter more fully into their mean|ing and energy; It may not, perhaps, be improper, briefly to relate the preceeding part of the hi&s;tory, to which they belong. <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> the beautiful and ambitious &s;on of King <HI>David,</HI> a&s;piring <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his father's throne, endeavoured, by an artful addre&s;s, and the mo&s;t grace|ful, courteous, and conde&s;cending behaviour, to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the affections of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> people; which point, he in a great mea&s;ure ac|compli&s;hed: For the &s;acred hi&s;torian informs us, that <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> &s;tole the hearts of the men of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and even entic'd <HI>Ahitophel,</HI> one of his father's mo&s;t eminent &s;tate&s;men and bo&s;om friends, to join with him in the con&s;piracy. &mdash;The rebellion was kept a profound &s;ecret from <HI>David,</HI> till it was ready to bur&s;t on his head, and then he was inform'd of it by a me&s;&s;enger, who let him know that the rebels were very &s;trong and numerous, and proba|bly would &s;oon put them&s;elves in motion: Whereupon, the hoary monarch, in order to prevent his being &s;urpriz'd, immediately march'd from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> with his tru&s;ty &s;ervants, and retir'd with the utmo&s;t &s;peed into the country; where he hoped to gain time, collect an army to with&s;tand the rebels, and defeat their ambitious de&s;igns. Whil&s;t the King was retreating from his capital, many who entertained an un&s;haken regard for him, pitied his mis|fortunes, and followed after him; among&s;t the&s;e was a very celebrated coun&s;ellor, and cordial friend to King <HI>David,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Hu&s;hai:</HI> His interview with his royal ma&s;ter, was very tender and affectionate; for when he
<PB N="2" REF="008383_0006_102F43E58A625340">
overtook him on the way, and beheld the mournful and di&s;tre&s;s'd condition, to which he was reduced, by the unnatural rebellion of his &s;on, he could not contain his inward grief, but rent his cloaths, and put earth on his head; profe&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time, his de&s;ign to continue with him in his adver|&s;ity, and &s;pend the la&s;t drop of blood in his cau&s;e.&mdash;<HI>David</HI> thank'd him for his loyalty, but withal told him, that the be&s;t &s;ervice he could do for him, in his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, was to go over to his &s;on <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> and pretend a de&s;ire to join with him in the con&s;piracy, that &s;o the prince re|ceiving him into his council, as a man of prime parts, he i. e. <HI>Hu&s;hai</HI> might defeat the &s;chemes of the famous <HI>Ahitophel;</HI> who&s;e wi&s;dom <HI>David</HI> &s;eem'd to dread more, than the united power of all the other rebels. &mdash; Accordingly <HI>Hu&s;hai,</HI> willing to do his utmo&s;t for his royal ma&s;ter, went over to <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> with a determination to counteract the advice of the &s;age <HI>Ahitophel,</HI> and to inform <HI>David</HI> privately of all the mea&s;ures taken by the enemy. When he was come into the pre&s;ence of <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> and had profe&s;s'd his de&s;ires of &s;erving him, he was readily receiv'd by the un|&s;u&s;pecting prince, and becau&s;e of his &s;uperior knowledge in &s;tate affairs, pre&s;ently admitted to be one of his privy council. Now it mu&s;t be ob|&s;erv'd, that <HI>David</HI> had no &s;ooner fled from his <HI>Metropolis,</HI> than <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> and his men, immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and the prince having &s;o far obtain'd his end, without delay, &s;ummon'd his council, to know what &s;hould be done next: The opinion of <HI>Ahitophel</HI> was fir&s;t requir'd, which he gave in the following manner. <HI>Let me now choo&s;e out</HI> 12,000 <HI>men, and I will ari&s;e, and pur&s;ue after</HI> David <HI>this night, and I will come upon him, while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: And all the people that are with him &s;hall flee, and I will &s;mite the King only.</HI> This advice of a &s;udden attack, and pur&s;uit after <HI>David</HI> and his men, whil&s;t they were yet in confu&s;ion, weary and weak handed, &s;eem'd, as it really was, exceeding rea&s;onable, and therefore was approv'd of without he&s;itation, by <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> and his party; yet before he would put it into practice, according to <HI>David</HI>'s conjecture, he demanded the opinion of <HI>Hu&s;hai:</HI> This faithful mini&s;ter, well knowing how much the life of his &s;overeign, would be en|danger'd by the execution of <HI>Ahitophel's</HI> project, endeavour'd to di&s;courage it as much as po&s;&s;ible, and with this view he told <HI>Ab&s;alom, That the coun&s;el which</HI> Ahitophel <HI>had given, was not good at that time,</HI> and as an argument to overturn it, he urg'd the extroardinary &s;kill of <HI>David</HI> in military affairs, and his undaunted courage and bravery.&mdash;This was the purport of his addre&s;s; <HI>Ahitophel</HI> has advis'd an immediate attack upon your father's forces and a direct pur&s;uit after him; but con&s;ider how de&s;perate the king and his men will fight, at this critical juncture, even <HI>like a bear rob'd of her whelps;</HI> which may occa&s;ion a total defeat of your army. Be&s;ides it will be in vain to attempt to find him now, for he is &s;o well vers'd in the &s;tratagems of war, that he will elude your &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch; this you mu&s;t know from what you have heard of his repeatedly e&s;caping the hand of <HI>Saul.</HI> He is &s;o well acquainted with caves and hiding places, that he will conceal him&s;elf in &s;ome retirement, where he cannot be found, and he will not expo&s;e his per&s;on to the fir&s;t on&s;et; but when his brave, tru&s;ty and experienc'd

veterans, who&s;e martial prowe&s;s is &s;o univer&s;ally celebrated, &s;hall make a breach upon your advanc'd guards, as &s;urely they will do, from their advantageous &s;ituation, and uncommon vigilance; then they will make a warlike &s;hout and &s;ay, <HI>There is a &s;laughter among&s;t the people that follow</HI> Ab&s;alom: <HI>And when</HI> this report is heard by our men, <HI>he who is valiant among us, who&s;e heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt with fear;</HI> the brave&s;t &s;oldier in our army will be &s;truck with a panic, and all our troops, <HI>even all</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>will be affrighted</HI> at the remembrance of his un|daunted valour, and that of his brave &s;oldiers, <HI>and flee before them: For all</HI> I&s;rael <HI>knoweth that thy father is valiant;</HI> they have had the mo&s;t un|doubted proofs of it, and they know that, <HI>tho&s;e which are with him are valiant men.</HI> Since then this is the ca&s;e, and we &s;hould run a dreadful ri&s;que, to attack &s;uch a brave body of de&s;perate and warlike men, with an army only of 12,000, and in the night, <HI>I therefore coun&s;el that all</HI> I&s;rael <HI>be generally gathered together, from</HI> Dan <HI>even to</HI> Beer&s;heba, <HI>as the &s;and that is by the &s;ea, for multitude, and that thou go to battle in thine own per&s;on;</HI> and by having &s;uch numbers on our &s;ide, we &s;hall make &s;ure of victory.&mdash;This coun&s;el pleas'd <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> and his men, and was prefer'd to that of <HI>Ahitophel.</HI> The argument which moved them to it, was the extraordinary valour of <HI>David</HI> and his &s;oldiers, &s;et forth in the mo&s;t &s;triking colours; they were particularly intimidated by the repre&s;entation, which <HI>Hu&s;hai</HI> made of the warlike and intrepid di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>David,</HI> and his &s;kill and experience in military affairs.&mdash;This point <HI>Hu&s;hai</HI> particularly pre&s;s'd upon <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> when he told him in the words of my text, <HI>Thy father is a man of war;</HI> that is, a brave, watchful, experienc'd, good and hardy &s;oldier, and therefore it will be no ea&s;y matter to &s;ubdue him, or take him by &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e words naturally lead me,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. To enquire into the military character of King <HI>David,</HI> and then to urge the &s;oldiers to the imitation of it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Then I am to enquire into the military character of King <HI>David.</HI> This will be equivalent to &s;hewing what is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a good &s;oldier.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place then, David <HI>was endued with natural courage and valour.</HI> His heart was as the heart of a lion, bold, intrepid and dauntle&s;s; he was an enterpri&s;ing and fearle&s;s man from his youth; this is evident from many particulars recorded by the &s;acred hi&s;torian; before he was in|troduced to <HI>Saul,</HI> whil&s;t he was yet a youth, he bore the character of a mighty valiant man, and a man of war. When he tended his father's &s;heep, a lion ru&s;h'd among the flock and &s;eiz'd a lamb; whereupon he boldly a&s;&s;aulted the furious bea&s;t, &s;lew him, and deliver'd the lamb out of his mouth; he &s;lew a bear al&s;o upon a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, 1 Sam. 17. When <HI>Goliath</HI> of <HI>Gath,</HI> the Phili&s;tine champion, a per&s;on of a gigantic &s;tature, and formidable appearance, had defied the whole army of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and none of them dared contend with him in &s;ingle combat, but fled from before his face; <HI>David,</HI> tho' a youth, was concern'd at the reproach of his country|men, and &s;aid; <HI>who is this uncircumci&s;ed Phili&s;tine, that he &s;hould defy the armies of the living God?</HI> He thus addre&s;s'd King <HI>Saul,</HI> when he beheld
<PB N="4" REF="008383_0008_102F43EB04022F20">
him dejected at the cowardice of his troops, <HI>Let no man's heart fail, becau&s;e of him, thy &s;ervant, will go and fight with this Phili&s;tine.</HI> After this he went out, &s;lew <HI>Goliath,</HI> be&s;trode his dead body, and cut of his head with the giant's own &s;word. This was a &s;ignal proof of a brave and undaunted &s;pirit, thus to face and contend with a man, the terror of who&s;e voice and a&s;pect had made all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> afraid: After <HI>David</HI> had thus &s;lain and beheaded the champion of the Phili&s;tines, he was promoted by King <HI>Saul,</HI> to be general of his forces, or (as the &s;criptures expre&s;s it) <HI>he was &s;et over the men of war.</HI> In that &s;tation he behaved very gallantly, and grew &s;o fa&s;t into re|putation, that he was e&s;teem'd and extol'd above his royal ma&s;ter; he di&s;|tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf by repeated victories over the Phili&s;tines, and perform'd &s;uch glorious exploits, that the women publickly &s;ang his prai&s;es, &s;aying, Saul <HI>hath &s;lain his thou&s;ands, but</HI> David <HI>his ten thou&s;ands.</HI> When <HI>Saul</HI> be|came envious of <HI>David</HI>'s increa&s;ing popularity, and &s;ought to kill him; he devis'd this expedient to execute his purpo&s;e.&mdash;He propos'd to give his daughter in marriage to <HI>David,</HI> upon this condition, that he &s;hould pro|cure him the fore&s;kins of an hundred Phili&s;tines; hoping he would fall by their hands: <HI>David</HI> was well pleas'd with and readily a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al: He went out, and in&s;tead of an hundred, he obtain'd the fore&s;kins of two hundred Phili&s;tines. When the <HI>Amalakites,</HI> with a con&s;iderable army, had burnt <HI>Ziklag,</HI> and carried away the women and children captives, he with a band con&s;i&s;ting only of 400 men, pur&s;u'd after them, gave them a total defeat, and recover'd the pri&s;oners and the &s;poil out of their hands. From all the&s;e, and &s;undry other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;acred writ, it appears, that <HI>David</HI> was naturally a man of undaunted courage; he was not afraid of plunging into the thicke&s;t fight; he was not intimidated by the mo&s;t war|like appearance, or the haughtie&s;t &s;peeches, but chearfully and eagerly a&s;&s;aulted the brave&s;t adver&s;ary: He never di&s;cover'd a timorous di&s;po&s;ition, but remain'd unruffled and unaw'd, amid&s;t the mo&s;t dreadful &s;cenes of &s;laughter. Now every good &s;oldier ought to re&s;emble <HI>David</HI> in this, for 'tis a &s;hame for a &s;oldier to be a coward. Tho&s;e who are di&s;titute of courage, do great injury in the day of battle, to the army, to which they belong, di&s;heartning others by their &s;candalous example.&mdash;They dare not fight them&s;elves; but by their <HI>timorous conduct,</HI> they terrify others; &s;uch per&s;ons had better be removed from an army, than continued in it; For many battles have been lo&s;t by means of the panic and confu&s;ion in|troduc'd by a number of fearful men; which, the braver part of the army would have gain'd, had the cowards been ab&s;ent. A &s;oldier's brea&s;t &s;hould glow with martial fire; his &s;oul &s;hould be daring and fearle&s;s. <HI>David</HI>'s heart (as before ob&s;erv'd) was like the heart of a lion; and when he ru&s;h'd to attack the foe, it was fill'd with inexpre&s;&s;ible ardor. This ardor of the heart can only be well under&s;tood by men of courage, who know it by experience. There is a certain enthu&s;ia&s;m which animates brave minds, when they are in battle, which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible by words minutely to di&s;|cribe; without &s;omething of this in his di&s;po&s;ition, I think a man &s;hould not devote him&s;elf to a military life; yet if he has, he &s;hould endeavour to acquire it by prayer to God, and meditation on the bold and glorious exploits of others.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="008383_0009_102F43EC91B51C90">Secondly, David <HI>was entirely acquainted with every branch of know|ledge that related to his duty as a &s;oldier.</HI> Saul informed the Ziphites, <HI>It had been told him, that David dealt very &s;ubtilly.</HI> David was the mo&s;t celebrated general of his age, for his &s;kill in military affairs; he knew full well how to exerci&s;e the bow and the &s;hield, and to handle the &s;word and the &s;pear; he knew when to advance, attack and pur&s;ue, and when to avoid a battle or make a retreat; he knew how to maintain his ground, and po&s;t his troops to the be&s;t advantage. The Scriptures relate, that when David went out, whither&s;oever Saul &s;ent him, he behaved &s;o wi&s;ely, that the King, on the account of his &s;kill, <HI>&s;et him over the men of war, and he was accep|ted in the &s;ight of all the people, and al&s;o in the &s;ight of Saul's &s;ervants,</HI> 1 Sam. xviii. 5. The &s;acred hi&s;torian informs us, that he was prudent in matters, <HI>i. e.</HI> a &s;kilful officer; he was advanced for the Sake of his Dexterity in the art of war, to be captain over a thou&s;and, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xviii. 13. And when he was a general, he di&s;covered his &s;kill in military affairs and characters, by chu&s;ing the be&s;t men to &s;erve under him, who ob&s;erved the &s;tricte&s;t di&s;ci|pline, and <HI>were mo&s;t expert in war.</HI> We read concerning the men that came to <HI>David,</HI> that <HI>they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war; they were armed with bows, and could u&s;e both the right hand, and the left, in hurling &s;tones, and &s;hooting arrows out of a bow,</HI> 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 11th and 12th Chapters.</P>
<P>DAVID was well ver&s;ed in the &s;tratagems of war; knew how to thwart and di&s;concert the &s;chemes of the enemy, and kept his &s;pies to in&s;pect their conduct, and give him intelligence of their proceedings. Thus he &s;ent <HI>Hu&s;hai</HI> to watch the motions of the rebels, and battle the mea&s;ures urged by <HI>Ahitophel;</HI> which he accordingly did, and privately &s;ent me&s;&s;en|gers to acquaint his royal ma&s;ter of it. <HI>David</HI> &s;ecretly came on the back of the Phili&s;tines, and by the &s;uddenne&s;s of his attack, gave them a total defeat, pur&s;ued after them, and took all their baggage and &s;poil, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> v. 25. He was wary, and upon his guard, again&s;t the contrivances of his foes, and always eluded, or fru&s;trated their de&s;igns, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xvii. 9. &amp;c. He was well acquainted with caves, lurking places, and inacce&s;&s;ible retreats, where he frequently concealed him&s;elf, and from which he often attack'd the enemy to great advantage, and &s;urprized them on a &s;udden, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxvi. He was acquainted with the art of fortification; <HI>for he took the city of</HI> Jebus, <HI>repaired the fortre&s;s</HI> Millo, <HI>and built round about, from</HI> Millo <HI>and inward:</HI> He under&s;tood the method of defending a Place, &s;calling a high wall, or taking a &s;trong hold by a&s;&s;ault, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> v. 7, 8. Thus, then, <HI>David</HI> was not only a brave, but a &s;killful hero; he was well acquainted with military affairs; and &s;o &s;hould every good &s;oldier be. I don't pretend to delineate preci&s;ely, the particulars of knowledge in the art of war; which ought to be &s;tudied and attained, by one who would make a figure in that profe&s;&s;ion; this is out of my province: I only a&s;&s;ert, that the&s;e particulars, be they what they will, &s;hould be familiar to a good officer or &s;oldier; for without the knowledge of them, their characters would be very incompleat. This is very evident from the Difference betwixt a veteran, or regular, and a raw provincial; he who would become an accompli&s;h'd &s;oldier,
<PB N="6" REF="008383_0010_102F43EE270F92A0">
&s;hould learn to be dexterous and active, in the u&s;e of the &s;word and firelock; be acquainted with every branch of his duty, &s;erve under an experienced general, and learn the art of war from him: He &s;hould read &s;uch books as treat on the &s;ubject of his occupation, the de&s;criptions of &s;ieges and fortification, the hi&s;tories of all preceeding battles, &s;tratagems, victories; and the ways whereby they were obtained, or lo&s;t, &s;hould be carefully pe|ru&s;ed by him; none &s;hould be preferred in an army, who are ignorant of military affairs: The placing of raw and unexperienced men, in any im|portant po&s;t, has often proved fatal to a warlike enterprize. <HI>David</HI> cho&s;e &s;killful men for his commanders; he &s;tudied the art of war him&s;elf, and <HI>had his officers teach the children of Judah the u&s;e of the bow,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> i. 18. Modern officers &s;hould be emulous to imitate the royal monarch in this; in&s;tructing the men committed to their care, and their men &s;hould readily &s;ubmit to their in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>David was a regular and obedient &s;oldier;</HI> he obey'd command, and follow'd the direction of his &s;uperiors, without the lea&s;t he&s;itation; and to the great peril of his life, the &s;acred hi&s;torian informs us, That <HI>David went out whither&s;oever Saul &s;ent him;</HI> and when the King &s;ignified his de&s;ire to have him go on a &s;couting party, and procure him an hundred fore&s;kins of an hundred Phili&s;tines: The thing plea&s;ed <HI>David,</HI> he imme|diately went out, and in&s;tead of an hundred fore&s;kins, he obtained double that number. Thus every &s;oldier &s;hould, with the utmo&s;t readine&s;s, obey the will and direction of his &s;uperiors. If &s;oldiers de&s;ert their po&s;t, fly from their colours, or refu&s;e to obey command, defeat and lo&s;s of victory mu&s;t needs en&s;ue: 'Tis their indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to &s;ubmit to their leaders, without murmuring or mutiny: Stubbornne&s;s in &s;oldiers, wears a dark and threat|ning a&s;pect, with regard to the &s;ucce&s;s of any warlike enterprize. I wou'd therefore &s;trongly urge it upon them, to propo&s;e the obedience of the jewi&s;h king for a model of their conduct.</P>
<P>Fourthly. <HI>David's brea&s;t was animated with a fervent love to his country;</HI> he was deeply concerned for its honour; and more e&s;pecially as the true church of God, as pure and undefil'd religion, exi&s;ted in it. When <HI>Goliath</HI> of <HI>Gath,</HI> had challenged his countrymen, and they were afraid to engage with him; <HI>David</HI> was concern'd at the reproach of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> indignation was enkindled in his bo&s;om, again&s;t his cowardly brethren; his heart burnt to fight the Phili&s;tine, and roll away the reproach from <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> When he beheld the giant, &s;triding with haughty &s;teps, before the jewi&s;h armies, and heard him defying the brave&s;t of them, and challenging them to &s;ingle combat, his &s;oul was all on fire to meet him. He cried out with the utmo&s;t ardour, <HI>Who is this uncircumci&s;ed Phili&s;tine, that he &s;hould defy the armies of the living God?</HI> And he ran to meet the Phili&s;tine, and quickly put an end to his proud and confident boa&s;ting. When the I&s;raelites were routed by the Phili&s;tines, and <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jonathan</HI> were &s;lain on mount Gilboa, <HI>David</HI> lamented over them, &s;aying, <HI>The beauty of I&s;rael is &s;lain upon the high places; how are the mighty fallen! tell it not in Gath, publi&s;h it not in the &s;treets of A&s;kalon, lea&s;t the daughters of the Phili&s;tines rejoice, lea&s;t the daugh|ters of the uncircumci&s;ed triumph.</HI> This admirable elegy di&s;covers what a
<PB N="7" REF="008383_0011_102F43F2D950E948">
tender &s;en&s;e he had of the honour of his country, and how ardently he wi&s;hed its welfare and pro&s;perity: That he loved his countrymen, is al&s;o evident from the following pathetic &s;peech, which created him a &s;trong intere&s;t in their hearts, <HI>Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my fle&s;h,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xix. 12. When he lived among&s;t the Phili&s;tines he could not forget his dear Country, but fought valiantly again&s;t her enemies. <HI>I&s;rael</HI> always lay near his heart, and he was ready to plunge him&s;elf in the greate&s;t dan|gers for her defence: Tho' his Country &s;ometimes treated him with ba&s;e in|gratitude, yet they could not de&s;troy his natural affection, or abate the ardour of his publick &s;pirit: He was a di&s;tingui&s;h'd patriot, and preferred the welfare of his nation, to his own life; of this you may behold a mo&s;t &s;trik|ing demon&s;tration, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxi. Chap. 17th Ver&s;e, when the de&s;troying angel brandi&s;h'd the &s;word of divine vengeance over Jeru&s;alem, and &s;lew multitudes of her inhabitants; <HI>David</HI> fell on his face before God, and &s;aid, <HI>I have &s;inned, and done evil in thy &s;ight; but as for the&s;e &s;heep, what have they done? Let thine hand, I pray thee, O lord my God, be on me and my fa|ther's hou&s;e; but not on thy people that they &s;hould be plagued.</HI> David loved the church, as well as the &s;tate; he pray'd earne&s;tly, and fought bravely in her behalf. The con&s;ideration that true religion might &s;uffer, if the I&s;ra|elites were defeated, made him exert him&s;elf with redoubled vigour, again&s;t the enemies of both. Now, you, my brethren, to whom this Di&s;|cour&s;e is directed, &s;hould &s;trive to have your hearts influenced by the &s;ame generous motives, which &s;o inten&s;ely warmed the brea&s;t of this Hebrew champion: You &s;hould con&s;ider that in the pre&s;ent war with France, the true prote&s;tant religion, the lives and properties of your countrymen, and all that is near and dear to them, lies at &s;take: If the enemy &s;hould prevail, then farewell to liberty of con&s;cience, the free enjoyment of our civil and &s;acred Privileges, and every thing el&s;e that is valuable in human life: If the enemy &s;hould prevail, then your friends, brethren and fellow &s;ubjects, mu&s;t die, or &s;uffer the greate&s;t extremities; therefore, if you have any regard for the&s;e endearing objects, the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, and a bleeding country; let the&s;e tender con&s;iderations excite you to exert your&s;elves with the utmo&s;t vigour in the day of battle; like David, reflect upon the reproach brought upon the briti&s;h arms, by the cowardice, neglect, or treachery of &s;ome of its unworthy &s;ons; and let your hearts be &s;en&s;ibly touch'd by the reflection: Endeavour to wipe away the &s;hame and di&s;grace which they have &s;o plentifully heaped on the nation, and let your bo&s;oms beat in your country's cau&s;e. A Heathen could &s;ay, <HI>Dulce et decorum e&s;t pro patria mori; it is plea&s;ant and honourable to die for our country;</HI> but how much greater rea&s;on has a chri&s;tian to &s;ay &s;o:
<Q>Our children are dear to us, our wives are dear to us, &s;o are our Parents, our kin&s;men, our friends and Acquaintance:</Q>
But e&s;pecially the church of Chri&s;t, and the privileges of our mo&s;t holy religion; but our country contains within it all the&s;e objects of endearment, therefore every good &s;oldier, every real chri&s;tian, &s;hould be ready to lay down his life for his COUNTRY.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. DAVID <HI>was a loyal &s;oldier, and true to his king.</HI> Tho' <HI>Saul</HI> treated him with the blacke&s;t ingratitude, defrauded him of his promi&s;ed reward,
<PB N="8" REF="008383_0012_102F43F5DBAC4250">
and &s;everal times made attempts upon his life; yet he could not be induced by this ungenerous treatment, to rebel again&s;t his king: Nay, whil&s;t <HI>Saul</HI> was pur&s;uing after him, and thir&s;ting for his blood, and an opportunity offered of &s;laying him, in the Cave of <HI>Engeddi,</HI> he could not be prevailed upon to do any thing more than barely to cut off the &s;kirt of his garment. In the wilderne&s;s of <HI>Ziph,</HI> where <HI>Saul</HI> had de&s;igns upon his life, he came to his tent whil&s;t he was a&s;leep, and took away his &s;pear only, when he might as ea&s;ily have taken away his life. This, as well as his expre&s;&s;ions to <HI>Abi&s;hai,</HI> and his other officers, &s;hew'd how much he reverenced the Lord's anointed. When <HI>Abi&s;hai</HI> &s;aid unto him, in the wilderne&s;s of <HI>Ziph, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand: Now, therefore, let me &s;mite him, I pray thee, with the &s;pear:</HI> He replied, <HI>De&s;troy him not, for who can &s;tretch forth his hand again&s;t the Lord's anointed, and be guiltle&s;s?</HI> Immediately af|ter, when Saul awoke out of his Sleep, he called him, his Lord and his King, and acknowledged him&s;elf his &s;ubject and &s;ervant, &s;aying, <HI>Where|fore doth my Lord thus pur&s;ue after his &s;ervant? for what have I done, or what evil is in me?</HI> In the Cave of Engeddi, when David's men advis'd him to &s;lay Saul, he &s;aid unto them, the Lord forbid that I &s;hould do this thing unto my ma&s;ter, the Lord's anointed; peru&s;e al&s;o his addre&s;s to Saul, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxiv. from 8 to the 15th Ver&s;e. After Saul was &s;lain on mount <HI>Gilboa,</HI> David di&s;covered his loyalty to him, by commanding the me&s;&s;enger to be executed, who declared he had put him to death; and by compo&s;ing that pathetic elegy, wherein he bewails the fall of his royal ma&s;ter, in the mo&s;t plaintiff and melancholly &s;trains. Now a good &s;oldier like David, &s;hould be loyal to his King, and ready to &s;pend the la&s;t drop of blood in his cau&s;e. If the jewi&s;h Hero was &s;o &s;trongly attached to a cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive monarch, who thir&s;ted for his blood, and treated him with the ba&s;e&s;t ingratitude; &s;urely you, my brethren, who have the honour of &s;erving <HI>the be&s;t of Kings,</HI> are under &s;uperior obligations, to promote the glory of his arms, with all your abilities, and fight for his dominions, which have been mo&s;t unju&s;tly invaded: So gracious a &s;overeign as his <HI>pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty,</HI> has the &s;tronge&s;t claim to the love and affections of every true Bri|ton: And all who enjoy the benefits of his <HI>royal favour,</HI> &s;hould be ready to &s;upport his mea&s;ures with their lives and e&s;tates. KING GEORGE THE SECOND, is the FATHER of his people; the pre&s;ent grand and expen&s;ive praparations to protect his American &s;ubjects, from the bloody De&s;igns of cruel and perfidious enemies, and remove their unju&s;t encroachments, and all the former ble&s;&s;ing of his maje&s;ty's benign government, are the mo&s;t convincing evidences of his paternal regard; he therefore would not de|&s;erve the name of a briton, who would not fight and die, for &s;uch a GRACIOUS KING.</P>
<P>But, Sixthly. <HI>David, tho' a brave &s;oldier, was not of a violent di&s;po&s;ition;</HI> he was not inclined to take away the property of his countrymen by force of arms, without a&s;king their con&s;ent, and contrary to rea&s;on and law: Of this his conduct in &s;ending his young men, civilly to a&s;k provi&s;ion of the &s;urly <HI>Nabal,</HI> is a plain proof; the hi&s;tory of the affair is to this purpo&s;e: David and his troops abode for &s;ome Time in the neighbourhood of <HI>Mount
<PB N="9" REF="008383_0013_102F43F8A687A9A8">
Carmel,</HI> in which <HI>Nabal</HI> lived; during this time they defended the flocks and &s;ervants of <HI>Nabal,</HI> both by night and day: They u&s;ed the latter with the utmo&s;t civility, and took not a &s;ingle lamb from the former; and there|fore one of <HI>Nabal</HI>'s young men gave this character of <HI>David</HI>'s, to <HI>Abigail; the Men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither mi&s;&s;ed we any thing as long as we were conver&s;ant with them.</HI> Thus did <HI>David</HI> train up his men to the greate&s;t order, and he &s;et them a very good example him&s;elf; as I hinted at before; for when his army was in great want of Provi&s;ion, in&s;tead of detaching an armed body to &s;eize <HI>Nabal's</HI> flocks, he &s;ent him the kinde&s;t Me&s;&s;age, de&s;iring a little refre&s;hment for him&s;elf and his &s;mall band: <HI>David &s;ent out ten men</HI> (&s;ays the &s;acred hi&s;torian) <HI>and he &s;aid unto the young men, get ye up to Carmel and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name, and thus &s;hall ye &s;ay to him that liveth in pro&s;perity, peace be both to thee and thine hou&s;e, and peace unto all that thou ha&s;t, and now I have heard that thou ha&s;t &s;hear|ers; now thy &s;hepherds that were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there aught mi&s;&s;ing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel: A&s;k thy young men, and they will &s;hew thee; wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes; give I pray thee, what&s;oever cometh to thy hand, unto thy &s;ervant and thy &s;on David.</HI> Thus gently did <HI>David</HI> and his men deal with the people among&s;t whom they re&s;ided; and every good &s;oldier &s;hould imitate their example. To &s;eize violently upon the property of others, without leave or con&s;ent; to in&s;ult, &s;trike and abu&s;e the innocent; to ru&s;h into an hou&s;e, with an armed mob, and take away the &s;ub&s;tance of the poor and helple&s;s; to trample upon the laws and liberties of the Nation, and defraud the hone&s;t man of his due: All this is contrary, extreamly contrary, to the genius of the go&s;|pel, and the dictates of rea&s;on and humanity, and is the very rever&s;e of that prudent conduct of the jewi&s;h monarch, which I have ju&s;t now de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Seventhly. <HI>David was an hardy, watchful and active &s;oldier.</HI> The &s;chemes which he had concerted, he immediately put into execution; witne&s;s his pur&s;uit of the <HI>Amalikites,</HI> who had taken, burnt and plundered <HI>Ziklag,</HI> and carried away its inhabitants pri&s;oners; among&s;t whom were <HI>David</HI>'s wives: He came upon them by forced marches, overtook them before they were aware of it, put them totally to the rout, and recovered his wives, the re&s;t of the captives, and the &s;poil, out of their hands. The activity of <HI>David,</HI> his expedition, and di&s;patch in the execution of his de|&s;igns, &s;hould excite gentlemen of the military character, to vigorous mea|&s;ures; the advantages that will redound from them, will be un&s;peakably great. Vigour and di&s;patch in the execution, are &s;ometimes e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to render a project &s;ucce&s;sful. The conduct of that ILLUSTRI|OUS HERO, of the pre&s;ent age, the KING OF PRUSSIA, and his uncom|mon &s;ucce&s;&s;es, are the plaine&s;t proofs of the truth of the&s;e remarks: <HI>David</HI> (I ob&s;erv'd was an hardy &s;oldier) he frequently underwent the greate&s;t toils and fatigues, he very often &s;lept in caves, rocks and dens of the earth; as any one may &s;ee who will peru&s;e his hi&s;tory; he &s;uffered hunger and thir&s;t, and the greate&s;t extremities in the high places of the field. At a certain time when he was in the cave of <HI>Aduilam,</HI> and was ready to faint for water,
<PB N="10" REF="008383_0014_102F43FBD7954EC8">
three of his worthies, at the peril of their lives, broke thro' the ho&s;t of the Phili&s;tines and fetcht him water; but notwith&s;tanding <HI>David</HI>'s extremity, he would not drink it, but poured it out to the Lord, and &s;aid, <HI>My God, for|bid it me, that I &s;hould do this thing: Shall I drink the blood of the&s;e men, that have put their lives in jeopardy? For with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.</HI> What a &s;tanding reproach is this conduct of the <HI>King of I&s;rael,</HI> to tho&s;e Per&s;ons who &s;acrifice the INTERESTS OF A NATION to their luxury, effeminacy and ea&s;e: He that devotes him&s;elf to a military life, &s;hould learn to endure hardne&s;s, to mortify his appetites, and deny him|&s;elf, when the intere&s;ts of his country call him, to it; otherwi&s;e he will prove but a very indifferent &s;oldier. A handful of hardy Macedonians, under the command of <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> could &s;ubdue a united king|dom of effeminate Per&s;ians: And this will always be the ca&s;e; tender, delicate and pamper'd con&s;titutions, unu&s;ed to labour and fatigue, can never &s;tand before the hardy and robu&s;t. <HI>David</HI> was al&s;o <HI>watchful,</HI> he ob&s;erv'd all the motions of the enemy, he maintain'd a con&s;tant guard, and thought it a crime worthy of death, for a &s;oldier to &s;leep when he was &s;et to keep watch. Thus, when <HI>Abner</HI> and all the guards of king <HI>Saul</HI> &s;lept about him, <HI>David</HI> &s;aid unto <HI>Abner, wherefore ha&s;t thou not kept thy Lord the king; ye are worthy to die, becau&s;e ye have not kept your ma&s;ter, the Lord's anointed.</HI> He manife&s;ted an extraordinary &s;pirit of vigilance, in repeatedly e&s;caping the hands of <HI>Saul,</HI> and avoiding the de&s;igns of his &s;on <HI>Ab&s;olom;</HI> compare 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxii.xxiii. and xxiv. chapters. Now every good &s;oldier mu&s;t tread in <HI>David</HI>'s &s;teps; be watchful, and always upon his guard again&s;t the enemy; he &s;hould be exceeding cautious not to be &s;urprized and taken unawares.</P>
<P>Eighthly. <HI>David was a compa&s;&s;ionate and humane &s;oldier;</HI> he was aver&s;e to cruelty and revenge; as &s;uch, he treated his enemies with a great deal of genero&s;ity and a forgiving temper: This we have partly &s;een from his conduct to <HI>Saul;</HI> he forgave Shimel, tho' he cur&s;ed him mo&s;t bitterly, and ca&s;t &s;tones and dirt at him, in the day of his trouble; he kindly received and entertained <HI>Abner,</HI> his rival's general; and after <HI>Joab</HI> had ba&s;ely murdered him, he with tears, lamented his death, and attended upon his Funeral. <HI>David</HI>'s conduct to the rebels, who had joined with his &s;on <HI>Ab&s;olom</HI> again&s;t him, manife&s;ted a gracious and merciful di&s;po&s;ition: And herein, &s;o far as he acted con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> I would propo&s;e him, my brethren, as a pattern for your imitation. I would not have you be of a cruel and revengful di&s;po&s;ition; but if you have an opportunity, I hope you will treat your enemies with tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion. I have ob&s;erved in reading hi&s;tory, that the brave&s;t men have generally been remarkable for their humanity, and generous di&s;po&s;ition towards their enemies; and you are in particular bound to exerci&s;e &s;uch a temper, as you are <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and enjoy the glorious light of the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> which is a <HI>&s;y&s;tem</HI> of the mo&s;t &s;ublime, di&s;intere&s;ted and exten&s;ive <HI>benevolence.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly. And to fini&s;h the military character of king <HI>David; he was a virtuous and religious &s;oldier;</HI> he loved and feared God, and chearfully obey'd his commandments; he was eminent for the purity of his heart, the warmth
<PB N="11" REF="008383_0015_102F4400A754E0D0">
of his devotion, and the holine&s;s of his life; he undertook and executed all his warlike operations, in a humble dependance on the divine power and A&s;&s;i&s;tance; he put no tru&s;t in an arm of fle&s;h, ab&s;tract from his crea|tor's ble&s;&s;ing. When GOLIATH beheld <HI>David,</HI> he di&s;dained and cur&s;ed him, and &s;aid, <HI>come to me, and I will give thy fle&s;h unto the fowls of the air, and the bea&s;ts of the field. David</HI> was not at all intimidated by the&s;e haugh|ty words, but boldly an&s;wered the Giant, <HI>Thou come&s;t to me with a &s;word, and with a &s;pear, and with a &s;hield; but I come to thee in the name of the</HI> LORD OF HOSTS, <HI>the God of the armies of I&s;rael, whom thou ha&s;t defy'd: This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand, and I will &s;mite thee, and take thine head from thee, and I will give the carca&s;&s;es of the ho&s;t of the Phi|li&s;tines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild bea&s;ts of the earth; that all the earth may know there is a God in I&s;rael; and all this a&s;&s;embly &s;hall know, that the Lord &s;aveth not with &s;word and &s;pear; for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give you into our hands: Some tru&s;ted in chariots, and &s;ome in hor&s;es, but</HI> David <HI>remembered the name of the Lord his God,</HI> P&s;alm xx. 7. He a&s;cribed all his courage, &s;ucce&s;s and &s;kill, in military affairs, to God: <HI>By thee</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>I have run thro' a troop, and by my God, have I leaped over a wall; it is God that girdeth me with &s;trength, and maketh my way perfect, he maketh my feet like Hinds feet, and &s;etteth me upon my high places, he teaches my hands to war, &s;o that a bow of &s;teel is broken by my arm,</HI> P&s;a. xviii. He di&s;claims all dependance on human power, in the xxxiii. <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> 16 and 17 Ver&s;es; <HI>there is no king &s;aved by the multitude of an ho&s;t, an hor&s;e is a vain thing for &s;afety; neither &s;hall he deliver any by his great &s;trength.</HI> Sen&s;ible of his dependance upon God, he always prayed for the divine ble&s;&s;ing before he engaged: This was his &s;upplication, <HI>Thou art my king, O God! command deliverance for</HI> Jacob. <HI>Through thee will we pu&s;h down our enemies, through thy name will we tread them under, that ri&s;e up again&s;t us. For I will not tru&s;t in my bow, neither &s;hall my &s;word &s;ave me; give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man. Thro' God we &s;hall do valiantly; for he it is that &s;hall tread down our enemies,</HI> P&s;alm xlvi. and lx. When <HI>Ahitophel,</HI> that eminent &s;tate&s;man, had gone over to <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> he cried out, <HI>O Lord, I pray thee, turn the coun&s;el of</HI> Ahitophel <HI>into fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI> When he was ready to be de&s;troyed by the hands of <HI>Saul,</HI> he prayed unto the Lord for deliverance, compare lvii. and lix. <HI>P&s;alms.</HI> When <HI>David</HI> had obtained a victory, he acknowledged the agency of God in it, and gave thanks to his great and glorious name; as may be &s;een in the xviii. and xxi. P&s;alms: Where he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the following manner, <HI>I have pur&s;ued mine enemies and overtaken them; neither did I turn again 'till they were con&s;umed. I have wounded them that they were not able to ri&s;e: For thou ha&s;t girded me with &s;trength unto battle; thou ha&s;t &s;ubdued under me, tho&s;e that ro&s;e up again&s;t me, thou ha&s;t al&s;o given me the necks of mine enemies.</HI> David was very con&s;tant in prayer to God; <HI>morning, evening, and at noon, he made his &s;upplication to the mo&s;t high;</HI> he loved the <HI>hou&s;e of God, and the place where his honour dwelt:</HI> He affirms, he <HI>would rather be a door-keeper in the hou&s;e of the Lord, than dwell in the tents of wickedne&s;s;</HI> and cries out, <HI>how amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of ho&s;ts!

Lord, and that will I &s;eek after, that I may dwell in the hou&s;e of the Lord, all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and enquire in his temple. David</HI> took a &s;acred delight in the contemplation of the law of God, and the reading of his word: <HI>His delight was in the law of the Lord, and in his law did he meditate both day and night.</HI> The practi&s;e of piety was &s;o far from being his burthen, that it was his greate&s;t plea&s;ure; according|ly, he &s;ings in the xix. P&s;alm, <HI>The &s;tatutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: More are they to be de&s;ired than gold; yea, than much fine gold: Sweeter al&s;o than honey, or the honey comb.</HI> He heartily approved of the duties of religion, and habitually hated all kinds of &s;in; <HI>he e&s;teemed God's precepts, concerning all things, to be right, and he hated every fal&s;e way.</HI> His piety was not only external; but his heart delighted in it. <HI>O! how I love thy law,</HI> (is his language) <HI>'tis my meditation all the day long:</HI> He ardently de&s;ired to make progre&s;s in holine&s;s, and be more conformable to the divine image, he a&s;pired after perfection, and panted after immortality. <HI>As the hart pants</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>after the water brooks, &s;o panteth my &s;oul, after thee, O God! My &s;oul thir&s;teth for God, the living God; when &s;hall I come and appear before God.</HI> His brea&s;t was enflamed with the mo&s;t lively and cordial gratitude to his heavenly father; of this his numerous affectionate thank&s;givings, in the p&s;alms, are an ample te&s;timony. <HI>David</HI> was anxious about the renovation and &s;anctification of his nature, and endeavoured to cultivate inward purity and holine&s;s; he truly repented of all his Sins, and offered to God the &s;acri|fices of a broken &s;pirit, a broken and contrite heart: He tru&s;ted in the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and merits of a future Me&s;&s;iah, for pardon and ju&s;tification: He confe&s;&s;ed his original and actual &s;ins, with the lowe&s;t humility, and &s;ought &s;alvation in a way of free and unmerited grace, accounting that man hap|py who&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was forgiven, and to whom the Lord imputed not iniquity; he renounced all dependance upon his own goodne&s;s, in the &s;ight of God, &s;aying, <HI>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name, be the honour and glory: He hated the congregation of evil doers,</HI> and ab&s;tained from the company of the wicked. <HI>He walked not in the coun&s;el of the ungodly; nor &s;tood in the way of &s;inners, nor &s;at in the &s;eat of the &s;cornful: He kept his tongue as with a bridle, whil&s;t the wicked were before him.</HI> He rejoiced, and delighted in God, and entertained a &s;olemn and affecting &s;en&s;e of his om|nipre&s;ence, power, glory, maje&s;ty, wi&s;dom, holine&s;s, goodne&s;s, mercy and truth; he was a per&s;on of the greate&s;t integrity, abhorred fal&s;ehood, and maintained a &s;acred regard for the truth; he thus addre&s;&s;ed the heart &s;earching God, <HI>O Lord! if there be iniquity in my hands, if I have rewar|ded evil unto him that was at peace with me; yea, have delivered him who without cau&s;e is mine enemy; let the enemy per&s;ecute my &s;oul and take it.</HI> He pre&s;ents us with the following de&s;cription of the good man, whil&s;t he gave an example of it in his own life and conver&s;ation. <HI>Lord, who &s;hall dwell in thy tabernacle? Who &s;hall abide in thy holy hill? He that walketh up|rightly and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;peaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach again&s;t his neighbour, in who&s;e eyes a vile per&s;on is contemptible: But he honoureth them that fear the Lord; he that hath clean hands and a pure

Heart, who hath not lift up his &s;oul to vanity, nor &s;worn deceitfully. David</HI> was convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of this character, in order to obtain future happine&s;s: He knew that <HI>the wicked would be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget</HI> God; he knew that Jehovah <HI>hated all the workers of iniquity, and would finally rain upon them &s;nares, fire and brim&s;tone, and an horrible tempe&s;t:</HI> Therefore he walked in the ways of holine&s;s, and kept the commandments of his God; knowing it was the only way to &s;ecure his ble&s;&s;ing here, and eternal felicity hereafter: He endeavoured to live in a &s;tate of reconciliation with God, that in ca&s;e he was &s;lain in battle, he might be tran&s;lated to tho&s;e HAPPY ABODES, where there is <HI>fullne&s;s, an ever|la&s;ting fullne&s;s of joy.</HI> A &s;en&s;e of his integrity, and the favour of God, made him bold and intrepid in the day of battle; he could look beyond the &s;cenes of &s;laughter, and behold the heavenly <HI>Canaan</HI> as his infallible reward; he knew how infinitely dangerous it would be, to ri&s;k his life in the high places of the field, if God was his enemy, and he remained in a unpardoned and un&s;atisfied condition; he knew that in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the mortal blow that depriv'd him of his life, would di&s;patch him to the regi|ons of never-ending mi&s;ery and di&s;pair; he therefore lived in the practi&s;e of univer&s;al virtue, and in a con&s;tant preparation for his great and la&s;t change: He cho&s;e God for the portion of his &s;oul, and maintained a life of communion with him in providence and ordinances; in &s;hort <HI>he denied all ungodline&s;s and every worldly lu&s;t, and lived &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent evil world.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, my brethren, I have de&s;cribed THE MILITARY CHARACTER OF KING DAVID; I now proceed to urge you to an imitation of it.</P>
<P>And, in the fir&s;t place, I beg leave to addre&s;s THE GENTLEMEN OFFI|CERS, under a view of the preceeding particulars.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>Let me exhort you to copy after that GREAT and EMINENT &s;cripture HERO, who&s;e piety, martial exploits, and endowments, I have ju&s;t now briefly &s;et before you; let the &s;ame zeal to vindicate the rights and liber|ties of your fellow &s;ubjects; let the &s;ame loyalty to your KING, and love to your COUNTRY, warm your brea&s;ts, which animated his; exerci&s;e the &s;ame benevolence and regard to the men placed under your command; be watchful over their morals and behaviour, and remember you are accoun|table to God for all tho&s;e mi&s;s-&s;teps in their conduct, which by your influ|ence, authority and example you, may prevent; &s;uffer them not to cur&s;e, &s;wear, get drunk, pillage, beat one another, and in&s;ult the innocent with impunity; yet remember, that in their puni&s;hment, you treat them as fel|low creatures, who partake of the &s;ame common nature with your&s;elves, and are entitled to your pity and tenderne&s;s. Di&s;cipline, con&s;idering the univer&s;al corruption of mankind, is nece&s;&s;ary in an army; yet it &s;hould be conducted with humanity, and according to the genius and &s;pirit of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN, You have ob&s;erv'd in the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e, that king <HI>David</HI> always went to battle in a humble dependance on the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and with earne&s;t prayers of &s;ucce&s;s from his almighty arm. I hope
<PB N="14" REF="008383_0018_102F4408F52D3478">
therefore, you will not be a&s;hamed to imitate the JEWISH MONARCH, in this important part of his conduct; and to implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, in every branch of your duty. Think not GENTLEMEN, that the great God is inattentive to the concerns of this lower world; for he rules the UNIVERSE by his PROVIDENCE, and makes the &s;cale of victory incline to whatever &s;ide he plea&s;es. We have po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances, in the &s;acred &s;cripture, that he interpo&s;ed in favour of particular armies, who &s;ought his a&s;&s;i&s;tance by prayer, and de&s;troyed others who de&s;pi&s;ed it; and is he not the &s;ame God now, that he was then? Is he not as much concern|ed in the management of events in the pre&s;ent conjuncture of affairs, as he was in former ages? Has not the pre&s;ent war furni&s;hed us with the mo&s;t &s;triking proofs of his SUPERINTENDENCY, and doth it not &s;eem, GENTLEMEN, that con&s;idering the &s;uperior number of briti&s;h troops at MONONGAHELA and TICONDEROGA; their defeat was owing to the frowns of that PROVIDENCE, which we did not &s;ufficiently acknowledge.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, don't &s;uffer the &s;ucce&s;&s;es with which his maje&s;ty's arms have been lately crown'd, to beget in you, a high opinion of your&s;elves, or a di&s;regard to that GOD, to the &s;miles of who&s;e favour we are principally indebted, for all the eminent advantages which our troops have obtained.</P>
<P>GOD him&s;elf has declared in his word, tho&s;e that honour me, will I honour; but he that de&s;pi&s;eth me &s;hall be lightly e&s;teemed. Oh! there|fore look unto him for VICTORY, and expect it from no other quarter.</P>
<P>GOD is a being of infinite power and wi&s;dom; he created and &s;u&s;tains the UNIVERSE, and whenever he plea&s;es, he makes a WRECK OF MATTER? AND A CRUSH OF WORLDS: Be then per&s;uaded to &s;eek the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his OMNIPOTENT ARM; lea&s;t, if you de&s;pi&s;e it, it fall upon you, and grind you to powder; lea&s;t it &s;catter his maje&s;ty's troops, and &s;trike terror thro' the &s;toute&s;t briti&s;h heart.</P>
<P>Finally, GENTLEMEN, we take this public opportunity, gratefully to acknowledge the &s;ignal &s;ervices done, in part by your&s;elves and the brave troops under your command, in the reduction of the important fortre&s;s of LOUISBOURG, and the i&s;lands of CAPE-BRETON and ST. JOHN'S: We confe&s;s our&s;elves much obliged to you, for the dangers and fatigues to which you have expo&s;ed your&s;elves, for the briti&s;h nation in general, and this part of his maje&s;ty's dominions in particular. Gentlemen, we ardent|ly wi&s;h and pray, that your former &s;ucce&s;s may be the happy prelude of more IMPORTANT VICTORIES; and may GOD improve you as in&s;truments in his hand, to cha&s;ti&s;e our cruel and perfidious enemies, and re&s;tore an honourable peace to your country. May the Lord of ho&s;ts pro&s;per your arms, protect your per&s;ons, and make you great and di&s;tingui&s;h'd ble&s;&s;ings: The&s;e are the &s;incere wi&s;hes of my heart, and I am per&s;uaded not only of mine, but every per&s;on in this a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>I now pa&s;s on to make an application of my di&s;cour&s;e to the SOLDIERS who are here pre&s;ent. Brethren, I have propo&s;ed, for your imitation, the example of a very religious and accompli&s;h'd &s;oldier, a man of di&s;tingui&s;h'd piety, and under the infallible direction of God's holy &s;pirit: Therefore let there be an emulation among&s;t you, who &s;hall re&s;emble it mo&s;t; let

there be a generous &s;trife, who &s;hall make the neare&s;t approaches to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> MILITARY CHARACTER OF KING DAVID. <HI>Be of good courage, and play the men for your people, and the cities of your God; and the Lord do that which &s;eemeth him good.</HI> Let the WELFARE of &s;o many of your fellow &s;ubjects, the welfare of the PROTESTANT INTEREST, the welfare of the CHURCH OF CHRIST, animate your hearts, and in&s;pire you with martial ardour and intrepidity. Let the blood of innocent babes and helple&s;s women, which has been &s;hed by barbarous hands; let the captivity and death of &s;o many brave &s;oldiers, the lo&s;s of important garri&s;ons, the groans of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed multitudes, the eminent danger which threatens the lives and proper|ties of your countrymen, and their invaluable liberties, both civil and &s;acred; let the&s;e united and affecting con&s;iderations, &s;tir you up to great and glorious deeds. Behold the bones of &s;laughtered britons, bleaching on the banks of MONONGAHELA; review TICONDEROGA'S BLOODY FIELD, covered with the bodies of your poor brethren: There the da&s;tard <HI>French</HI> &s;hrunk into the ground from BRITISH VALOUR; and hardly &s;ecure in their deep, inacce&s;&s;ible intrenchments, with trembling hearts, &s;lew the heroes whom they dur&s;t not face. Oh BRITAIN! O my COUNTRY! how did thy VALIANT SONS fall in battle; how were thy MIGHTY &s;lain by ho&s;tile hands: There HOWE, the HERO, and the PATRIOT fell, there fell a li&s;t of WORTHIES, expo&s;ed to an unequal chance, and cut off by an untimely &s;troke. O! let the&s;e tender reflections, my brethren, arou&s;e up all the <HI>man</HI> and the <HI>briton,</HI> and exert you to attack the enemy with redoubled ar|dour and fury. Let a &s;en&s;e of BRITTANNIA'S WRONGS, and the di&s;honour which her arms have &s;uffered; let the glorious victories of your renowned ance&s;tors, and all that is great and noble, warm you brea&s;ts, and make you dauntle&s;s like lions. Endeavour, by the mo&s;t gallant exploits, to wipe of the di&s;grace which has been ca&s;t on the briti&s;h arms, and retrieve the glory of the Engli&s;h name. Con&s;ider how <HI>David</HI> was concerned to take away the reproach from <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and what indignation glow'd in his brea&s;t again&s;t the Phili&s;tine; and let the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion be in you, let your arms, <HI>let your &s;words, be like the bow of</HI> Jonathan, <HI>which turned not back; and the &s;word of</HI> Saul, <HI>which turned not empty from the blood of the &s;lain, from the fat of the mighty: De&s;ert not</HI> your po&s;t, fly not from your duty in the day of battle, but bravely face the adver&s;ary, and ru&s;h on to the bold at|tack; fight manfully, plunge into the mid&s;t of the enemy, and <HI>turn not again 'till they are fallen under your feet, 'till you have beat them &s;mall as the du&s;t before the wind.</HI> But here let me caution you, not to venture in your own &s;trength, not to tru&s;t in an arm of fle&s;h; but, like <HI>David,</HI> go forth in the name of the Lord; exert your&s;elves in a humble dependance on his ble&s;&s;ing and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; pray earne&s;tly to him for direction, courage, and &s;ucce&s;s; apply to God to &s;trengthen your hands, and cover you heads, in the day of battle. Without the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance you can do nothing; thus we read, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxvi. 5. <HI>That when king</HI> Uzziah <HI>&s;ought the Lord, God made him to pro&s;per;</HI> but the contrary happened when he neglected it: And <HI>when the children of Judah,</HI> in Abijah's reign, <HI>relied upon the Lord God of their fathers, they prevailed again&s;t the children of</HI> I&s;rael.

tru&s;t in the LORD, and make the MOST HIGH your habitation: And re&s;t per&s;uaded, that numbers, courage and military &s;kill, will avail you nothing, if God &s;hould frown upon you; this we all know by melancholly experi|ence, the battle is not to the &s;trong, nor the race to the &s;wift; <HI>For God de&s;troys the proud</HI> and mighty, <HI>in the imagination of their hearts; and exalts the humble</HI> and the weak: <HI>He doth according to his &s;overeign will and plea|&s;ure, in the armies of heaven above, and among&s;t the inhabitants of the earth below; and there is none that can controul him, &s;tay his hand, or dare &s;ay unto him, what doe&s;t thou?</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, my brethren, let me tell you, if you de&s;ire &s;ucce&s;s to attend your arms; 'tis nece&s;&s;ary, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that you, as well as we, &s;hould ab&s;tain from &s;inful practices; for GOD <HI>hates, and is angry with the wicked every day,</HI> and will baffle the de&s;igns of tho&s;e that de&s;pi&s;e his authority, and trample his laws under foot; he will frown upon their mea&s;ures, and cau&s;e them to fall by the hands of their enemies. We are told, <HI>Deut.</HI> xxii. 9. <HI>That when the ho&s;t goeth again&s;t the enemy, then the peo|ple &s;hould keep them&s;elves from every wicked thing.</HI> We are al&s;o informed in the 7th of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> that the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> could not prevail again&s;t the children of <HI>Ai,</HI> 'till they had <HI>put away the evil and accur&s;ed thing, from among them.</HI> Now let me a&s;k you, brethren, do you make any attempts to eradicate vici|ous habits, and lay a&s;ide the practice of iniquity? Are there not on the contrary, many among&s;t you who commit the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abominations? who delight in drunkenne&s;s, fornication, violence, riotous living, prophane &s;wearing, and other dete&s;table vices? Now, how can you rea&s;onably expect the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing of God,</HI> as long as you are guilty of &s;uch ba&s;e actions? <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing of God;</HI> no, his wrath will come upon &s;uch tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors to the uttermo&s;t. Let me tell you, if you fall in battle, you will, without doubt, be ca&s;t into HELL, where the &s;moak of your torments will a&s;cend for ever and ever. Let me therefore urge you to for&s;ake your &s;ins, and turn to God with all your hearts; be cha&s;te and temperate; wrong no man; do violence to no man, neither accu&s;e any fal&s;ely, and be content with your wages; obey your officers; behave in a &s;ober, regular and di&s;creet manner: In &s;hort, imitate the character of KING DAVID, and thus you will obtain the love of your fellow creatures, and there will be a much greater probability of your &s;ucce&s;s in the day of battle.</P>
<P>Let me advi&s;e all the &s;oldiers indi&s;criminately, to &s;earch into their &s;piri|tual &s;tate: See to it, my brethren, whether you are prepar'd to meet death, the king of terrors; examine your&s;elves, whether ye be in the faith, prove your own &s;elves; do you live as probationers for eternity?

Have you, with holy <HI>David,</HI> heartily renounced, and &s;incerely repented of all your Sins? do you live a life of faith in a &s;aviour's merits, and of obedience to his divine commandments? Do you, with the royal P&s;almi&s;t, delight in prayer, in prai&s;e, in going to the hou&s;e of god, and reading, and medita|ting upon his word?

life, your greate&s;t burthen? and do you, with the <HI>King of I&s;rael,</HI> pray ear|ne&s;tly for the pardon of your &s;ins, and the &s;anctification of your natures? Are you anxious to cultivate inward purity, maintain communion with God, and make advances in the divine life? Have you been convinced of your lo&s;t and ruin'd condition by nature, and your expo&s;edne&s;s, whil&s;t in that condition, to divine wrath and ju&s;tice? And have you, in con&s;equence of this conviction, by faith, fled to Je&s;us, the only city of refuge? If you have not, you are in a very un&s;afe and di&s;mal &s;ituation; for God out of Chri&s;t is a <HI>con&s;uming fire;</HI> and &s;inners out of Chri&s;t, are expo&s;ed, not only to temporal, but ETERNAL DEATH: Let me therefore exhort you, before you go to the field of battle, to make God your tru&s;t, your buckler, your &s;hield and your high tower; lean not upon your&s;elves, your own valour, your own &s;trength, or your own righteou&s;ne&s;s; tru&s;t not in hor&s;es or cha|riots, but tru&s;t in the name of the <HI>Lord of ho&s;ts, the God of the armies of I&s;rael;</HI> flee to Chri&s;t immediately, without any delay, &s;ecure an intere&s;t in his favour, and then neither death nor life, neither France nor hell, can &s;eparate you from his love. But like good <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> if &s;lain in battle, you will be carried by angels from blood and carnage, from tumult and &s;laugh|ter, to the regions of everla&s;ting and undi&s;turb'd repo&s;e. I exhort you all to attend to the&s;e &s;erious con&s;iderations; I warn you all as a friend, who is anxious for your pre&s;ent and future welfare, to avoid tho&s;e &s;ins and abo|minations, which are, alas! too common in an army: Avoid every kind of profanene&s;s and immorality; &s;hun, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the company of the wicked, and in the time of lei&s;ure, meditate on religious &s;ubjects, and let it be a matter of the highe&s;t concern to your &s;ouls, to prepare for death, judgment and eternity. Now is the only accepted time, now is the day of &s;alvation; therefore in God's name, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and as you would not be forever mi&s;erable; let me be&s;eech and intreat you, with the utmo&s;t importunity, to con&s;ider the&s;e things which belong to your peace, before they are everla&s;tingly hid from your eyes.</P>
<P>Believe me, my brethren, when I reflect that there are &s;o many poor &s;ouls among you, going very &s;oon to the field of battle, ftom whence 'tis probable that &s;ome of you will never return; and when I con&s;ider that they are not yet reconciled to god, thro' the blood of his &s;on, and there|fore mu&s;t peri&s;h forever, if &s;lain by the enemy.&mdash;I &s;ay, when I con&s;ider the&s;e things, my heart bleeds for you: Unhappy creatures, whom the &s;word of the adver&s;ary may &s;end to the &s;hades of hell: Repent of all your &s;ins betimes; in the day of action you will have no opportunity for this important purpo&s;e, therefore now embrace the GOLDEN MOMENTS, and &s;eek the pardon of your &s;ins, and an intere&s;t in the MERITS of CHRIST, before you go hence to be here no more.</P>
<P>Brethren, you have re&s;ided for &s;ome time among&s;t us, and I hope and believe you have been, in the main, well treated by the inhabitants of this town; we have always wi&s;hed you well, and therefore are unwilling you &s;hould part from us, without expre&s;&s;ing that our hearts are toward you. We wi&s;h you a ble&s;&s;ing from the hou&s;e of the Lord. GOD ALMIGHTY ble&s;s you, protect and pro&s;per you! <HI>Teach your hands to war and your fine|gers
<PB N="18" REF="008383_0022_102F4417D6BA1D80">
to fight;</HI> give you courage and conduct, make you the terror of your enemies, and the defence of your country! <HI>God be your refuge and &s;trength, a very pre&s;ent help in time of trouble: The</HI> LORD OF HOSTS be with you; <HI>the God of Jacob be your refuge!</HI> may he render you &s;ucce&s;sful, make bare his EVERLASTING ARM in your behalf, give you the necks of your enemies, render your expedition &s;afe, honourable and victorious; make you good and faithful &s;oldiers of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and at la&s;t confer upon you, a CROWN of unfading glory, a CROWN of EVER BLOOMING AND TRIUMPHANT LAURELS: That this may be the happy portion of every &s;oul in this a&s;&s;embly, may God of his infinite mercy grant, for the &s;ake of our dear redeemer, to whom, with the father and the holy &s;pirit, be, rendered and a&s;crib'd, the kingdom, power and glory, for ever and ever. AMEN.</P>
