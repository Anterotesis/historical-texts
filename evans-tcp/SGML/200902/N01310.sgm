<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in <HI>Compliance</HI> with the De&s;ire of an Honourable Friend that I <HI>Wrote</HI> both, &amp; <HI>Preach'd</HI> One, of tho&s;e ESSAYS which I now pre&s;ent unto his, and the Publick Acceptance. I did it from a perfect Concurrence I had with him, and ma|ny other Good men, in the Opinion, That a|mong the <HI>Engines of Piety,</HI> wherewith our Good God has accommodated us, the <HI>Rainbow</HI> is one too much neglected with the Profe&s;&s;ors of our Holy Religion. To Recover the <HI>Rain|bow</HI> unto the U&s;e of our <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Hope,</HI> and <HI>Joy,</HI> and thus to teach the <HI>Prai&s;ing</HI> Tribe, the <HI>U&s;e of the Bow,</HI> I &s;aw to be &s;o &s;en&s;ible a Ser|vice unto the <HI>De&s;igns of Piety,</HI> that I could not but chearfully Embrace it. A very few Hours, and not many more, than the Modern In&s;pec|tion finds <HI>Colours</HI> in the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> made me an&punc; Owner of &s;uch <HI>Thoughts</HI> upon my <HI>bright Theme,</HI> that I began to imagine, I had hone&s;t Old <HI>Bernards</HI> Imprimatur for them; <HI>Si metu forte, aut Segnitie, aut minus di&s;creta Humilitat, Verbum bonum, quod po&s;&s;it prode&s;&s;e multis, inutili, imo et damnabili Ligas Silentio, certe maledictus eris, qui Frumenta ab&s;condis in Populis.</HI> Accord|ingly

they are now offered unto the <HI>Children of the Covenant</HI> And One of the Things wanting in the <HI>Chri&s;tian A&s;ceticks</HI> is thus brought in to the Churches Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>The Readers for who&s;e Edification the&s;e <HI>E&s;|&s;ayes</HI> are chiefly Calculated, are for the mo&s;t part Plain men, <HI>Dwelling in Tents.</HI> It would rather <HI>puzzle</HI> &s;uch Readers, than <HI>In&s;truct</HI> them, to give them a Lecture on the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> of the <HI>Rainbow</HI> Nor does the Author profe&s;s him&s;elf to be &s;o much of a <HI>Mathematician,</HI> as to do it with the Exactne&s;s, wherewith it ought to be done, or to be any more than a <HI>Well|willer to &s;uch Mathematicks.</HI></P>
<P>A Famous Clergy-man of <HI>Spalato,</HI> in a Book <HI>De Radijs Vi&s;us et Lucis,</HI> Written before the Be|ginning of the former Century, began <HI>Mathe|matically</HI> to de&s;cribe how the <HI>Interior Bow</HI> of the <HI>Iris,</HI> is made in Round Drops of <HI>Rain,</HI> by a Re|fraction of the Suns Light, and One Reflection between them; and the <HI>Exterior,</HI> by Two Re|fractions, and Two &s;orts of Reflections between them, in each Drop of Water.</P>
<P><HI>De&s;cartes,</HI> (who don't u&s;e to betray his Tu|tors,) took the Hints from <HI>Antonius De Dominis,</HI> and went on <HI>Mathematically,</HI> and with much Demon&s;tration, to give us a Theory of the <HI>I|ris,</HI> from the Laws of <HI>Refraction,</HI> which <HI>Lucid Rayes</HI> do &s;uffer in pa&s;&s;ing thro' Diaphanous Bo|dies. He clearly demon&s;trated the <HI>primary I|ris,</HI> to be only, <HI>The Suns Image, reflected from the Concave Surfaces, of an Innumerable Quantity of
<PB N="iii" REF="001559_0004_0FB3B0D54DF63030">
&s;mall Sphaerical Drops of falling Rain, with this Nece&s;&s;ary Circum&s;tance, that tho&s;e Rays which fell on the Objects, parallel to each other, &s;hould not after One Reflection, and Two Refractions,</HI> (viz. <HI>At going into the Drop and coming out again</HI>) <HI>be Di&s;per&s;ed, or made to diverge, but come back again al&s;o to the Eye, parallel to each other.</HI> The <HI>Secondary Iris</HI> he &s;uppo&s;es <HI>produced by tho&s;e Rays of the Sun, which fall more obliquely, but after the &s;ame manner as be|fore, only in the&s;e there are Two Reflections before the Suns Rays refracted a &s;econd time, and tending towards his Eye, in a parallel Po&s;ition, can get out from the Aqueous Globules.</HI></P>
<P>The Acute and Accurate Mr. <HI>Halley</HI> comes after the <HI>French</HI> Philo&s;opher, and &s;hows how the <HI>Carte&s;ian</HI> Problems were more ea&s;ily &s;olved than the Author him&s;elf imagined, He &s;hows how to determine the Angle, by which the <HI>I|ris</HI> is di&s;tant from the oppo&s;ite Point of the Sun, and the <HI>Ratio</HI> of the Refraction being given Geometrically, or, <HI>Vice Ver&s;a,</HI> the <HI>Iris</HI> being given, to determine the Refractive Pow|er of the Liquor. And he goes on to Cul|tivate the Subject, with the Ingenuity pro|per to that accompli&s;hed Gentleman.</P>
<P>But then comes the Admirable Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton;</HI> One whom I may venture to call The <HI>Perpetual Dictator</HI> of the Learned World in the <HI>Principles of Natural Philo&s;ophy;</HI> and the mo&s;t Sagacious Rea&s;oner upon the <HI>Laws of Na|ture,</HI> that has yet Shone among Mankind; and which is the Crown of all, The mo&s;t Vic|torious

A&s;&s;ertor of an Infinite GOD, that hath appeared in the bright Army of them that have driven the baffled Herd of <HI>Athei&s;ts</HI> away from the Tents of Humanity. This Rare Per&s;on, in his Incomparable Treati&s;e of <HI>Opticks,</HI> has yet further Explained the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the <HI>Rain|bow;</HI> &amp; has not only &s;hown how the <HI>Bow</HI> is made, but al&s;o how the COLOURS are form'd; How the Rays do &s;trike the Sen&s;es, with the <HI>Colours,</HI> in the Order which is required by their Degrees of <HI>Refrangibility,</HI> in the Pro|gre&s;s from the In&s;ide of the <HI>Bow</HI> to the <HI>Out&s;ide;</HI> the <HI>Violet,</HI> the <HI>Indico,</HI> the <HI>Blue,</HI> the <HI>Green,</HI> the <HI>Yellow,</HI> the <HI>Orange,</HI> and the <HI>Red.</HI></P>

<P>A Mind commonly forming of <HI>Good Thoughts,</HI> &amp; filled with them on all Occa&s;ions is thereby really Ennobled and Enriched: And <HI>Thoughts</HI> do not more prove the <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> of it, than <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> Ones will contribute unto its <HI>Felicity.</HI> Such a <HI>Mind</HI> makes a ju&s;t claim, to the <HI>Dignity,</HI> which in REASON belongs unto it; and it <HI>has,</HI> yea, it <HI>makes,</HI> a &s;ort of <HI>Heaven</HI> for it &s;elf, with an Holy Anticipation of the more Local Flight, it is e're long to take into the <HI>Heavenly World.</HI> It follows, that One of the be&s;t Kindne&s;&s;es that can be done unto the Children of Men, is to <HI>Supply</HI> them with <HI>Good Thoughts:</HI> One of the Kinde&s;t Offices that we can do for our Neighbours, is to awaken in them the <HI>Thought</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="001559_0009_0FB3B0DD6F5ABDE0">
of the <HI>Rational</HI> and <HI>Religious;</HI> and help them in <HI>Thinking</HI> on the Things wherein they are con|cerned. <HI>Of Writing many Books</HI> for this End, our <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tes</HI> long &s;ince advi&s;ed, <HI>Let there be no End!</HI> Tho' the <HI>Study</HI> of Writing them &s;hould be <HI>never &s;uch a Wearine&s;s to the Fle&s;h,</HI> yet we will not be <HI>Weary of Well-doing</HI> in this way, nor count it a <HI>Vanity,</HI> in this way to go on with E&s;|&s;ayes to cure <HI>Vanity.</HI></P>
<P>We are &s;urrounded with the Preachers of Truth unto us; All the Elements are full of them: In all <HI>Creatures</HI> we have the Faithful <HI>Preachers;</HI> if we have but <HI>Ears to hear them.</HI> To put the <HI>Creatures</HI> unto &s;uch an U&s;e, as that of being Led by them unto <HI>Good Thoughts,</HI> and unto the due Acknowledgments of Their and Our Maker and Saviour; 'tis, to do &s;ome|thing towards the <HI>Re&s;titution of all Things,</HI> unto the Primitive and Paradi&s;ian State; yea, O <HI>Sons of God,</HI> it is a little to bring on the State, for <HI>which the whole Creation groaneth!</HI> Of our <HI>Duties,</HI> and of His <HI>Prai&s;es</HI> to whom we owe our Duties, I will &s;ay, <HI>Great is the Army that Publi&s;h|eth them!</HI> And the Kingdom of METEORS has rai&s;ed for us a particular Army of <HI>Monitors;</HI> among which there is none that makes a more Illu&s;trious Figure, than <HI>One</HI> which I am go|ing to re&s;cue from the Neglect, with which it has been too much di&s;regarded &amp; overlooked in a World, which owes more pious Regards unto it.</P>

not from me, any Attempts at <HI>Philology.</HI> To tell you, that the Hebrew Name for it is, <HI>Ketcheth;</HI> The Greek <GAP DESC="foreign">, as well as the Latin, <HI>Iris;</HI> the French, <HI>L'arc du Ciel;</HI> (or, the Bow of Hea|ven;) and in like manner, the Italian <HI>L'arco del Cielo;</HI> and the Spani&s;h, <HI>El arco del Cielo;</HI> (as al|&s;o, <HI>El arco de las nueues,</HI> or, The Bow of the Clouds:) and the <HI>German</HI> (more akin to ours) <HI>Ein Regenbogen;</HI> This would perhaps as little E|dify you, as to tell you, that <HI>our Indians</HI> call it by &s;ome &s;uch Name, as <HI>Ukqumogquoanuh.</HI> I &s;hall as little attempt the <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> of it; For, after I have given you the common Definition of it, <HI>Arcus Coele&s;tis, qui fit ex Solis Luce, in Nubem varie compo&s;itam et temperatam, &s;ed ex Diametro Soli ip&s;i incurrente ac incidente, pluvio&s;o tempore;</HI> and &s;hould add more than as many more, as there be <HI>Colours in the Rainbow;</HI> and with the Modern Corrections of ancient Er|rors, proceed unto the Differences between the <HI>Solar Iris,</HI> and the <HI>Lunar:</HI> and between the <HI>Iris</HI> and the <HI>Halo;</HI> &s;o little progre&s;s have we yet made in real and certain <HI>Knowledge,</HI> that I &s;hould Leave you after all, with the Subject of my Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>but in the Clouds.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a <HI>Theological</HI> Con&s;ideration of this <HI>Meteor</HI> that is now propo&s;ed. <HI>The Go&s;pel of the Rainbow,</HI> is the Theme I have undertaken very briefly to treat upon. I take the <HI>Rain|bow</HI> to be intended, when we read of <HI>Bright Clouds.</HI> The Glorious One, directed His Peo|ple to <HI>Ask Rain</HI> of Him; <HI>a moderate Rain</HI> in
<PB N="4" REF="001559_0011_0FB3B0E0953E9940">
the Time that &s;hould render it Sea&s;onable and Serviceable. It is hereupon promi&s;ed, <HI>So the Lord &s;hall make Bright Clouds:</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Clouds brightned with the Rainbow;</HI> and &s;uch as a <HI>Moderate Rain,</HI> u&s;es to be di&s;tilled from. Compare <HI>Job</HI> XXVII. 11. We often enjoy this Favour of Heaven; but I am now to bring you the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of it. And my Treati&s;e mu&s;t begin with a Complaint, That the <HI>Chri&s;tian World</HI> have taken &s;o little Notice of a <HI>Meteor,</HI> upon which the <HI>Great God that formed all things,</HI> has put &s;uch a Stamp of peculiar Excellency. It has plea&s;ed His Infinite Maje&s;ty, to Stamp a <HI>Sacramental Character</HI> upon it, and make it as a <HI>Sacrament</HI> of His <HI>Covenant</HI> with the Children of Men. We all know, that when the Patriarch <HI>Noah,</HI> with his Family, came out of the <HI>Ark,</HI> the Glorious GOD <HI>comforted</HI> him, and his Po&s;terity, with &s;uch an Advice as this; Gen. IX. 13.&mdash; 17. <HI>I &s;et my Bow in the Cloud, and it &s;hall be for a To|ken of a Covenant, between Me, and the Earth. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, when I bring a Cloud over the Earth, that the Bow &s;hall be &s;een in the Cloud; and I will Look upon it, that I may Remember the Ever|la&s;ting Covenant between God, and every living Crea|ture of all Fle&s;h that is upon the Earth. And God &s;aid unto</HI> Noah, <HI>This is the Token of the Covenant which I have E&s;tabli&s;hed between Me and all Fle&s;h that is upon the Earth.</HI> I believe the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Milain</HI> is the only Author in the World, that e|ver under&s;tood this <HI>Bow</HI> of any other than the <HI>Rainbow.</HI> Now, certainly after this, When|ever
<PB N="5" REF="001559_0012_0FB3B0E2CFD7DCC8">
a <HI>Rainbow</HI> is Exhibited, there is a Sett of <HI>Good Thoughts,</HI> with which it &s;hould al|ways be Look'd upon. But God is not Glori|fied upon the view of the <HI>Rainbow</HI> &s;o Com|monly, &s;o Devoutly, and with &s;uch <HI>Good Thoughts,</HI> as ought to be: nor does it gene|rally put us upon &s;uch <HI>Reflections</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, as might be expected from a People of our Il|luminations in the <HI>Covenant</HI> of the Glorious Lord. I mu&s;t not make a <HI>Fruitle&s;s Complaint;</HI> and therefore my De&s;ign is, now to fit &s;ome <HI>Arrows</HI> for the <HI>Bow</HI> of God, and make ready a <HI>Quiver</HI> of <HI>Good Thoughts,</HI> Which are to be &s;hot from that <HI>Bow</HI> into the Minds of the Faith|ful, as often as it appears unto us.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>Fir&s;t U&s;e</HI> that we unavoidably make of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> will be in a way of <HI>Admiration.</HI> Tis truly an <HI>Admirable</HI> Spectacle. The Spectator of it, is to be called forth in tho&s;e Terms; Job XXXVII. 14. <HI>Stand &s;till, Con|&s;ider the Wondrous Works of God.</HI> And this the more Emphatically, becau&s;e the <HI>Rainbow</HI> appears in the very next words of <HI>Elihu;</HI> for the <HI>Rainbow</HI> is meant in tho&s;e words, <HI>He cau&s;es the Light of His Cloud to &s;hine.</HI> The Pagan Theology makes the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> to be the <HI>Daughter</HI> of <HI>Thaumas</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign">] becau&s;e of the <HI>Wonderment</HI> wherewith we behold it; It is to us, we would rather &s;ay, The <HI>Mother of Wonderment.</HI> But the <HI>Wonders</HI> which it rai&s;es in our Minds, ought to be tuned into <HI>Prai&s;es</HI> of the <HI>Great God,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Strength is in the Clouds,</HI> &amp;
<PB N="6" REF="001559_0013_0FB3B0E461AF5638">
who di&s;plays His Power there. HE is to be Admired &amp; Adored, &amp; with Devout Souls, we are to Look through the <HI>Bright Clouds,</HI> &amp; &s;hoot up our <HI>Hallelujahs. Glorious LORD, How Various and how Beauteous are thy Works! With what Wi&s;dom and what Beau|ty ha&s;t thou made them all!</HI> The Le&s;&s;on is <HI>A|pocryphal,</HI> but Agreeable, which was long &s;ince given by the Son of <HI>Sirach;</HI> [Eccle&s;. XLIII. 11, 12.] <HI>Look upon the Rainbow, and prai&s;e Him that made it; very beautiful it is in the bright|ne&s;s thereof; It compa&s;&s;es the Heaven above with a Glorious Circle, and the Hands of the mo&s;t High have bended it.</HI></P>
<P>But we may not, we will not flop here.

<P><HI>O Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty.

<P><HI>Whether there were any <HI>Rainbow</HI> before the Flood?</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer two things.

Dr. <HI>Jack&s;on</HI> argues, That if other <HI>Natural Cau&s;es</HI> de|pend upon the <HI>Final,</HI> which we are taught in the <HI>Scriptural Philo&s;ophy,</HI> we may well think, that the <HI>Air</HI> before the <HI>Flood,</HI> had not the peculiar Di&s;po|&s;ition, which is required unto the Production of the <HI>Rainbow;</HI> which then had not &s;uch an <HI>End,</HI> as that for which it is now Employ'd by the Glorious God. It is now a <HI>Me&s;&s;enger,</HI> that Reports and Confirms unto the <HI>New World,</HI> the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God, for the Pre&s;ervation of it.

<PB N="19" REF="001559_0026_0FB3B0FC4FC32030">
whereof it is In&s;tituted for a <HI>Token;</HI> whereof one point is this; The <HI>Rainbow</HI> is <HI>Naturally</HI> a <HI>Token,</HI> that the <HI>Rains</HI> will not be <HI>Great,</HI> nor <HI>Long;</HI> and that <HI>Fair Weather</HI> is anon to be Look'd for. <HI>Bodin</HI> &s;peaks the Sen&s;e of the u&s;ual Progno&s;tications on the Appearance of the <HI><HI>Rainbow;</HI> Certi&s;&s;imum e&s;t Argumentum, Imbres fore Leviores.</HI> 'Tis therewithal a mo&s;t a|greeable and Symbolical <HI>Token,</HI> that the World &s;hall not be any more &s;o De&s;tructively, as once it was, <HI>Rained</HI> upon.

<P>But then, I propo&s;e, that our Thoughts go on to Con&s;ider, on <HI>who&s;e,</HI> and on <HI>what</HI> Account the World comes to be &s;o &s;pared by the Lord.</P>
<P>When the Lord &s;ays unto <HI>Noah, With thee will I e&s;tabli&s;h my Covenant,</HI> it is a Remark of <HI>Mun|&s;ter</HI> upon it; That this refers to the <HI>Covenant</HI> made at the Beginning, about the <HI>Promi&s;ed Seed,</HI> that was to break the <HI>Old Serpents Head.</HI> This <HI>Covenant</HI> is now Renewed and A&s;&s;ured unto <HI>No|ah;</HI> who now being &s;atisfied, That the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was to de&s;cend from him, he could no longer doubt, that God would have a <HI>Church</HI> continued among his Po&s;terity. Accordingly, When we think on the <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> of the World, promi|&s;ed with the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> it &s;hould be with &s;uch Thoughts as the&s;e; <HI>Tis for thy &s;ake, O our

<P>And then, as it is well remark'd by <HI>Hei|degger;</HI> The CHURCH of God has a &s;ingu|lar, a peculiar Concernment, in this <HI>Covenant</HI> of the <HI>Rainbow.</HI> The <HI>Churches</HI> coming to <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> by the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and &s;o the <HI>Inheri|tance</HI> of the <HI>Righteous,</HI> lies Enwrapped in it.

<P>Our Saviour has a <HI>People</HI> in the World; A <HI>People,</HI> that believe in Him; that follow His Conduct; that in the way of Obedience to

<P><HI>A Glorious CHRIST! How can I Look to Hea|ven at any Time, and e&s;pecially NOW! without ra|vi&s;hing Thoughts of Him and of His Glories!</HI> The <HI>Rainbow</HI> will many wayes put us in mind of our Admirable Saviour. He would not have appeared with a <HI>Rainbow</HI> about Him, as He did in the Vi&s;ions both of <HI>Ezekiel</HI> and of <HI>John,</HI> if He did not intend that the <HI>Rainbow</HI> &s;hould Lead us to think of Him. Shall we &s;ay, That the <HI>Covenant</HI> on which our Eternal Safety depends, is made with our <HI>Saviour?</HI> Tis verily &s;o; The Agreement is between God the Fa|ther, and our <HI>Saviour.</HI> He is <HI>our Head;</HI> We are nothing but what we are <HI>in Him.</HI> Shall we go on to &s;ay, That all the <HI>Good</HI> Engaged unto us in the <HI>Covenant</HI> of our Safety, is owing to our <HI>Saviour?</HI> Tis verily &s;o; Our <HI>Saviour</HI> is the <HI>Purcha&s;er</HI> of it all; the <HI>Di&s;pen&s;er</HI> of it all. The <HI>Rainbow</HI> is the Proclamation of, A God <HI>Re|conciled</HI> unto the Children of Men. <HI>Iris</HI> is re|lated unto <GAP DESC="foreign">. 'Tis our JESUS that is the Author of the <HI>Reconciliation.</HI> We read, 2 Cor. V. 19. Of, <HI>God in CHRIST, Reconciling the World unto Him&s;elf.</HI> At the View of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> this were a very proper Acknowledgment; <HI>'Tis by thy Mediation, O our dear Saviour, that the Great GOD becomes Reconciled unto us!</HI></P>
<P>I will proceed; There are &s;ome, who would find in the <HI>Rainbow</HI> it &s;elf, &s;ome Intimations of

the <HI>Glories</HI> belonging to our <HI>Saviour.</HI> In the <HI>Sun</HI> begetting of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> &s;ome would read a little of that incomprehen&s;ible My&s;tery, <HI>The only begotten Son of God.</HI> In the <HI>Three Colours</HI> (for of old, they counted no more) of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> others would read, the <HI>Three Offi|ces</HI> of our Great Redeemer. But the&s;e are <HI>Strains</HI> that I would not in&s;i&s;t upon; and I would not Look upon the <HI>Clouds</HI> too fancifully.

it was of old given as the Commen|dation of a Famous and U&s;eful man; Eccle&s;i|a&s;t.

<P>But then, I will take Leave, to fetch from the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> an In&s;truction of the <HI>Humility,</HI> that &s;uch a man will be adorned withal.

The Oracles of the Sacred Scripture have po&s;itively declared it; 2 Pet. III. 7. <HI>The Heavens and Earth which are now, be re&s;erved unto Fire, again&s;t the Day of Judgment, and Perdition of Ungodly Men.</HI> And &s;ome read it, in the very <HI>Colours</HI> of the <HI>Rainbow;</HI> as plainly Legible there as ever it could be upon <HI>Seths</HI> Pillars of old: The <HI>Watery</HI> Colour Leads them, to think on the <HI>Water</HI> which once de&s;troy'd the World. The <HI>Gra&s;&s;y</HI> Colour Leads them, to think on the <HI>Day of Patience</HI> which God now allows unto the World, to bring forth <HI>Fruit</HI> unto Him: The <HI>Fi|ery</HI> Colour Leads them to think, on that <HI>Fire</HI> which is e're long to con&s;ume the World.

Hearts unto the <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> with our Sup|plications; <HI>Lord, Let me have an Holy Faith, and Hope, and Love, ever &s;hining in my Soul!</HI></P>
<P>It has been on all hands agreed, That in the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> we have, the <HI>Mercy</HI> of our God, in Lively Colours Painted out unto us. And &s;ome will more Particularly have the <HI>Three Colours</HI> of <HI>Red,</HI> and <HI>Green,</HI> and <HI>Blue,</HI> in the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> to intimate the &s;weet Mixture of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Mercy,</HI> accompli&s;hed by the <HI>Blood</HI> of the <HI>Covenant.</HI> But it is a Prejudice to tho&s;e <HI>Niceties,</HI> that the Co|lours of the <HI>Rainbow</HI> are more than <HI>Three,</HI> This however, may, Thirdly, be a very Proper Meditation on the Sight of the <HI>Rainbow.</HI> It Proclames the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God unto a Sinful World. Yea, how <HI>Emblematically!</HI> It was noted by <HI>Am|bro&s;e</HI> of old; That our God &s;ayes, <HI>I will put my Bow in the Cloud.</HI> He &s;ayes nothing of any <HI>Ar|rows.</HI> Tis a <HI>Bow</HI> without <HI>Arrows.</HI> When we &s;ee this <HI>Bow,</HI> let us then call to mind the <HI>Mercy</HI> of our God; and with a Grateful Soul acknow|ledge, Lam. III. 22. <HI>It is of the Lord's Mercies, that we are not Con&s;umed; becau&s;e His Compa&s;&s;ions fail not.</HI> Indeed as the <HI>Rainbow</HI> is formed in a <HI>Cloud,</HI> (which <HI>Commenius</HI> ob&s;erves,) <HI>a Luce in millies millenis diffluentu Nubis Guttulis div<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;imode reflexa:</HI> the <HI>Mercies</HI> of our God unto us, are far more than the <HI>Drops</HI> in that <HI>Cloud. Lord, How great is the Sum of them!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mercy</HI> of God, holds out the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> like the <HI>Scepter</HI> of old, and invites the wor&s;t of men, to come in unto Him, with an Exerci&s;e of
<PB N="32" REF="001559_0039_0FB3B11125EAC1B0">
true Repentance. He &s;ayes to the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> as in Jer. III. 12, 13. <HI>Go, and Proclaim the&s;e words, and &s;ay, Return, and I will not cau&s;e my Anger to fall upon you, for I am Merciful, &s;aith the Lord: Only acknowledge thine Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>But then, there are two Circum&s;tances of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> that carry much Admonition in them. And there al&s;o, are to be taken into your Meditation.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The <HI>Bow</HI> is only to be &s;een <HI>above the Earth.</HI> Accordingly, tis only in this Life, and while we are yet <HI>above the Earth,</HI> that we have our Opportunity to lay Hold on the <HI>Offered Mercy</HI> of God. <HI>Lord, They that go down into the Pit, cannot hope for thy Truth.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Tho' the <HI>Bow</HI> has no <HI>Arrows</HI> upon it, yet the <HI>Impenitent</HI> will find, the Great GOD, has His <HI>Quiver full</HI> of them. The Great God has Trea&s;ures of Wrath, and fearful Re&s;erves of Plagues for the <HI>Impenitent.</HI> He &s;ayes, <HI>I will heap Mi&s;chiefs upon them, I will &s;pend my Arrows upon them.</HI></P>
<P>I pa&s;s on, to take notice, in the Fourth place; of &s;ome <HI>Le&s;&s;ons</HI> which the <HI>Rainbow</HI> may give us, concerning the <HI>Covenant</HI> and the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of our Saviour. Some of the mo&s;t <HI>Judicious</HI> Men in the World, and &s;uch as have been the far|the&s;t from indulging and humouring a roving <HI>Fancy,</HI> have ye noted &s;uch Things as the&s;e. The <HI>Rainbow</HI> never fills a <HI>Circle,</HI> nor makes more than a <HI>Semicircle.</HI> The Kingdom of our Lord in His Church, has in this thing a Picture
<PB N="33" REF="001559_0040_0FB3B112A3565F18">
of it. It is part <HI>on Earth;</HI> part <HI>Above.</HI> Our Sa|viour was <HI>on Earth</HI> when He Suffered for us, and began His Kingdom; He went up from <HI>Earth</HI> to <HI>Heaven;</HI> and will come down from <HI>Heaven</HI> to <HI>Earth</HI> again. The <HI>Afflictions</HI> attending the Kingdom of our Lord in the World, and the <HI>Enemies</HI> not yet all wholly &s;ubdued, make the Condition of a <HI>Semicircle</HI> too agreeable unto it. The <HI>Circle</HI> will not be filled up, till the Kingdom &s;hall be <HI>delivered up unto the Father,</HI> and <HI>God</HI> &s;hall become <HI>All in All.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;ince the <HI>Rainbow</HI> is not a <HI>Perfect Circle,</HI> if <HI>Moreover the Servants</HI> of God are <HI>Warned</HI> from thence, of the <HI>Imperfection,</HI> which will at|tend all <HI>Sublunary</HI> Things, we &s;hall but go on to make an Improvement thereof, that &s;ome Wi&s;e Men have made before us. Look upon the <HI>Rainbow</HI> that wants <HI>Perfection,</HI> [its near|ne&s;s to the <HI>Earth</HI> allows it not!] and &s;ay, <HI>I have Seen an End of all Perfection!</HI></P>
<P>But, Finally, Let our <HI>Meditation</HI> carry us over, to another World, that has <HI>it.</HI> The Ex|cellent <HI>Al&s;ted</HI> advi&s;es us, from the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> to form a <HI>Meditation,</HI> of the <HI>Glory</HI> that &s;hall be imparted by our Saviour, to our <HI>Bodies,</HI> at the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Dead.</HI> After this manner he gives us the Noble Reflection. <HI>Si Deus per Solem in Nubibus Excitat tam Splendidum Meteorum, multo magis ip&s;e tanquam <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Ju&s;titiae in Corpo|ribus

<P>A Rainbow was upon his Head.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is the <HI>Head</HI> of your admirable Saviour, which, O Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People of God, now appears before you. Oh! Behold it, with &s;weet Encouragements; with ju&s;t A&s;toni&s;hments! The <HI>Head</HI> about which we now &s;ee the comfortable <HI>Rainbow,</HI> is <HI>thy Head,</HI> O thou Church of the Living God; It is HE, whom God has Placed as <HI>thy Head,</HI> and thou thy Self ha&s;t cho&s;en Him, ha&s;t owned Him.</P>
<P>When you &s;ee what it is that this <HI>Mighty Angel</HI> comes down from Heaven to do; That He comes with a loud Voice to proclame the End of the <HI>Time</HI> for the Reign of Sin and Satan in the World, and make a Demand of this Lower World, for the Kingdom of the Great Redeemer, how, how can you forbear a loud Voice of Supplications&punc; <HI>Great God, Send this Mighty Angel <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> wrong</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></P>
<P>The Servant of God had &s;een the Face of the
<PB N="38" REF="001559_0045_0FB3B11C99B14D10">
<HI>Roman Empire,</HI> down as Low as the conclu&s;ion of the <HI>Saracen</HI> Oppre&s;&s;ions, and the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ho&s;ti|lities; the very Period unto which we are now certainly arrived. Then there appears unto him, a <HI>Mighty Angel,</HI> in &s;o Stately and &s;o Splendid a Pomp, that many Interpreters can hardly allow Him to be any le&s;s a Per&s;on than our Great <HI>Sa|viour</HI> Him&s;elf. He appears to Exhibit a <HI>New Scene</HI> of things Marvellous and very Amazing. And if <HI>this</HI> be the Period for the Appearance of &s;uch an Angel, I do a very <HI>Sea&s;onable</HI> Thing this Day, in Showing Him among you. I di&s;pute not, whether this <HI>Angel</HI> be our <HI>Saviour</HI> Him&s;elf, becau&s;e He de&s;cends with a Glory too big and bright for any Creature; Or, whether He be a <HI>Created</HI> Angel; For, if He be <HI>&s;o,</HI> yet He comes in the <HI>Name</HI> of our <HI>Saviour;</HI> and He comes with a Repre&s;entation of that <HI>Glory,</HI> which belongs to none but our <HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>The De&s;ign of the De&s;cent made by this <HI>Migh|ty Angel,</HI> is, to foretel, and bring on, a wonder|ful <HI>Reformation</HI> of the World. If he appears in a <HI>Cloud,</HI> this mu&s;t not be wondred at. There is a Super-cele&s;tial <HI>Cloud,</HI> which from the Begin|ning has been Employ'd as a <HI>Symbol,</HI> and a <HI>Cover</HI> for the Maje&s;ty of our God, in His Appearance. Not only the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> who were favoured &s;ome|times with an actual view of &s;omething that be|long'd unto that va&s;t <HI>Cloud;</HI> but even the <HI>Pagans</HI> al&s;o, and their <HI>Poets,</HI> had &s;ome Tradition of it.</P>
<P>There is an Intimation in it, that there will be <HI>Un&s;earchable</HI> Circum&s;tances, <HI>Un&s;earchable</HI> Di&s;|pen&s;ations,
<PB N="39" REF="001559_0046_0FB3B11DE69B1650">
in His Appearances. And if thou wilt come unto us in <HI>Cloudy Times,</HI> O Glorious Lord, Thy will be done: Yet, <HI>Even &s;o come unto us!</HI></P>
<P>The only Thing that we now Single out for con&s;ideration, is that <HI>Particular Glory</HI> of our Ap|pearing Saviour; <HI>A Rainbow was upon his Head.</HI> The <HI>Rainbow</HI> is a well-known <HI>Meteor,</HI> often beheld, but not with Eyes Devout enough, among us in the <HI>Day of Rain.</HI> Perhaps, there is nothing in all the <HI>Meteorous Kingdom</HI> &s;o very Beautiful. Such is the <HI>Beauty</HI> of the <HI>Meteor,</HI> that while the Heathen <HI>Mythology</HI> made it, <HI>The Daughter of Wonderment, Cicero</HI> makes it a matter of Wonderment that it was not Lifted in the Number of their Gods. Let tho&s;e declaim on this <HI>Beauty,</HI> who can fetch a Text from the Son of <HI>Sirach,</HI> that &s;ayes, <HI>Look on the Rainbow, and Prai&s;e Him that made it; very Beautiful it is in the Bright|ne&s;s thereof.</HI> That which it becomes us mo&s;t of all to Ponder, is, That the Sovereign Creator of the World, has in His Wi&s;dom Stamp'd a <HI>Sacramen|tal Character</HI> on the <HI>Rainbow;</HI> He has In&s;ti|tuted the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> for a <HI>Sign,</HI> and <HI>Seal,</HI> of His <HI>Covenant</HI> with the World. All Chri&s;tians are appri&s;ed of the Signification which the <HI>Ninth Chapter of Gene&s;is,</HI> has left upon the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> for our perpetual Con&s;olation; and as our A&s;|&s;urance, that the World &s;hall no more be <HI>Drown'd,</HI> as it was in the Days of <HI>Noah.</HI> Wherefore, our Saviour appearing to us, <HI>with a Rainbow,</HI> about His <HI>Head,</HI> Propo&s;es to Preach this Joyful <HI>Doctrine</HI> unto us.</P>
<Q><PB N="40" REF="001559_0047_0FB3B120AD9C50B8">Our Glorious LORD, will Remember His Covenant with His People; Even in the mo&s;t Cloudy Times, that are Pa&s;&s;ing over them.</Q>
<P>And this is the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> which I am now to in&s;i&s;t upon; I wi&s;h you had a more able <HI>Bar|nabas,</HI> to in&s;i&s;t upon it. My <HI>Doctrine,</HI> it may <HI>drop as the Rain;</HI> as the Sweet, and Small Rain from a <HI>Cloud,</HI> that has a <HI>Rainbow</HI> brightning of it. We may &s;ee <HI>Cloudy Times;</HI> Yea, we may appre|hend &s;uch a <HI>Flood</HI> of Calamity, as will carry all before it; yet now, O People of God; You are a People in <HI>Covenant</HI> with Him; A Reliance on your <HI>Sacrificed Saviour,</HI> Secures your Title to His <HI>Covenant.</HI> O Now Look up to your dear Savi|our.

His Temptations make it the <HI>Hour</HI> and <HI>Power of Darkne&s;s</HI> with him. He knows not what to do, nor what God intends to do. Perhaps it comes to that Extremity; <HI>Lord, Thou ha&s;t covered thy &s;elf with a Cloud, that my Prayer &s;hould not pa&s;s through.</HI> In &s;o <HI>dark</HI> a Time, the afflicted Belie|ver is afraid of a <HI>Flood</HI> that will totally over pow|er him; that he &s;hall <HI>peri&s;h in his Affliction.</HI></P>

Perhaps, the power of <HI>Corruption</HI> in you may be &s;uch, that you may think, <HI>I &s;hall one day peri&s;h by the Hand of &s;uch or &s;uch a Sin!

<P>Secondly. When we &s;ee the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of the Lord admini&s;tred, the&s;e Meditations may be very Sea&s;onably awakened.

We are minded of this <HI>Covenant</HI> after an Excellent Manner, by the Admini&s;tration of <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> in our Congregations. God Sanctifies the Sight of this Admini&s;tration, as well as the other <HI>Ordinances</HI> in the A&s;&s;embles of <HI>Zion;</HI> and it is a Profane Folly to make light of a thing which God u&s;es for an <HI>In&s;trument</HI> of &s;o much Good unto the Souls of Men.

rather, becau&s;e I find, 1 Pet. III. 19. <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> is made the Antitype of the <HI>Flood;</HI> unto which the <HI>Rainbow</HI> has Relation.

<P>And, yet; I judge it not ami&s;s to acquaint you, That there is of late, within the&s;e few years, a mo&s;t Surprizing <HI>Revival of Good Things</HI> in the World. Should I &s;peak of but One <HI>Country;</HI> There are &s;ome &s;trict ob&s;ervers of the Signs of the Times,

who have lately Publi&s;hed a <HI>Collection</HI> of Ob&s;erva|ble Things, wherein the Kingdom of God has been more &s;en&s;ibly opening it &s;elf in the Heart of <HI>Germany;</HI> Things of an Holy &amp; Hopeful Ten|dency, to bring on a more ample Reign of <HI>Piety;</HI> The Collection contains no fewer than <HI>Four&s;core and Four Articles.</HI> In many other places, there are &s;ome Excellent Things a doing. <HI>E&s;&s;ayes to do Good,</HI> begin to be in reque&s;t.

Among the re&s;t, there is this to be ob&s;erved; A <HI>Spirit of A&s;&s;ociation</HI> for Noble &amp; Pious Purpo&s;es, has of late begun Strangely to Vi&s;it the World; it be|gins to do Wondrou&s;ly.

<P>In the next Place; I will freely confe&s;s to you, that there is not any One thing at this day a do|ing, which I have my Eye more upon, than the <HI>Fate,</HI> &amp; I hope, the approaching <HI>Fall,</HI> of the <HI>Ottoman Empire.</HI> There is a Coincidence of more than as many things, to per&s;wade us, That the <HI>Threchun|dred &amp; ninety odd years</HI> allotted for the <HI>Turks</HI> to be the Plagues of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> Expired at the late Peace of <HI>Carlowitz.</HI> If that Empire &s;hould once fall, what a <HI>Jubilee</HI> would arrive to the poor

<P>I have one thing more to &s;ay. The Grandeur of <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> is plainly on a Decline.
