<HEAD>AN APPEAL.</HEAD>
<P>A STATE of contention between Great Britain and America, is not only di&s;agreeable but dangerous. We have every in|fluence of intere&s;t and affection to attach us to each other, and make us wi&s;h to pre&s;erve the union indi&s;&s;oluble. The &s;ame laws, the &s;ame religion, the &s;ame con&s;titution, the &s;ame feelings, &s;entiments and habits, are a common ble&s;&s;ing and a common cau&s;e. We have the&s;e general benefits to defend again&s;t the re&s;t of the world, which is ho&s;tile to all, or to the greater part of them.</P>
<P>With ties &s;o &s;trong to bind us to each other, is it not &s;trange, is it not deplorable, that we &s;hould differ? Do they who talk of cha&s;ti&s;ing our colonies, and reducing them to obedience, con&s;ider how much we hazard when we di&s;&s;olve the&s;e ties? What are we to &s;ub&s;titute in their place?&mdash;Force and fear&mdash;which Tacitus wi&s;ely tells us, are <HI>infirma vin|cula, quae ubi removeris, qui timere defierint, odi&s;&s;e incipient</HI>&mdash;"in&s;ecure re&s;traints, and always &s;ucceeded by inveterate hatred." When the&s;e con&s;equences follow from the coercive mea&s;ures we are now pur&s;uing, with the coun&s;ellors, who have impelled us to them, by repre&s;entations not, I am &s;ure, very fair, defend us from their fatal effects?</P>
<P>It is from experience only that nations learn wi&s;dom. But unhappily &s;ometimes the injury of the experiment is irretrievable. We have too much rea&s;on, I think, to apprehend that this will be the event of our pre&s;ent conduct. The cour&s;e of the la&s;t war gave us proof of the &s;trength and &s;ucce&s;s which ari&s;es from the cordial attachment of our colonies; and, in all human probability, the next war will convince us of the feeblene&s;s which flows from their di&s;affection. I hope to prove, inconte&s;tably, that they aided us during the la&s;t war with a degree of zeal and efficacy which we can never again expect, at lea&s;t unle&s;s our language and conduct be totally rever&s;ed. The war found us united; it was conducted gloriou&s;ly upon the &s;trength of that union; and left us in perfect harmony. Unhappy were the councils which di&s;turbed that harmony; unhappy was the idea of taxation, which, with|out being productive of any one of the benefits expected from it, has given birth to a thou&s;and calamities which were not fore&s;een. From the aera of this innovation we are to date all the di&s;turbances which have &s;haken the whole empire; and which, if we do not treat them with more wi&s;dom, mu&s;t inevitably end in the di&s;&s;olution of all American de|pendence on the parent &s;tate.</P>
<P>In 1755 the Lords pronounced the Americans to be "a great body of brave and faithful &s;ubjects." [See their addre&s;s, Nov. 13, 1755.]
<PB N="4" REF="014147_0004_0F93542E51685068">
Let this be compared with the language of their la&s;t addre&s;s, and it will &s;hew the happy effect of our late proceedings.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering this &s;ubject, two very material que&s;tions immediately pre&s;ent them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Whether we have a right to tax the colonies?</HI> and, <HI>Whether it be expe|dient to exerci&s;e that right?</HI></P>
<P>If a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate examination &s;hould &s;hew, that both or either of the&s;e mu&s;t be an&s;wered in the negative; it will prove, that our pre&s;ent mea&s;ures are not dictated by political wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>In order to determine whether we have a right to tax the colonies, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the nature of taxation&mdash;in whom the right of grant|ing money re&s;ides&mdash;and from whence that right ari&s;es.</P>
<P>Taxation, con&s;titutionally &s;peaking, is the giving and granting the property of the people, by them&s;elves, or by per&s;ons authorized by them, who are called their delegates or repre&s;entatives. From hence it fol|lows, that the right of impo&s;ing taxes re&s;ides originally in the people, and then in the repre&s;entative body; and that it ari&s;es from the delega|tion of the people.</P>
<P>The very idea of property involves in it an exclu&s;ive right of giving it by the immediate or intermediate con&s;ent of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. For as Mr. Locke &s;ays, What property can I have in that which another may take away at his plea&s;ure? It is therefore a fundamental principle in our con&s;titution, and was, until the reign of Henry VI, the invariable practice of it, that the property of the people, not one man excepted, could not be granted but with his own con&s;ent, given by him&s;elf or his repre&s;entative cho&s;en by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It was upon this principle that, until that reign, every man in the kingdom gave his vote, or had a right to give his vote, for the election of a repre&s;entative, on whom that power was devolved. The &s;eventh of Henry IV, made upon complaint of this right having been di&s;turbed, ordains, that all the people &s;hall elect indifferently. Their re&s;idents in the county is the only qualification required.</P>
<P>It was not until the eighth year of Henry VI, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of forty &s;hillings <HI>per annum</HI> in any part of the kingdom, was made nece&s;&s;ary to give a right of voting; which qualification was, in the tenth year of the &s;ame reign, re&s;tricted to freehold in the county. It is plain from this, that the writers who have controverted Mr. Locke's po&s;ition, that, upon the principles of the con&s;titution, "the &s;upreme power cannot take away any man's property without his con&s;ent," were unac|quainted as well with the principles as the practice of the con&s;titution, or artfully mi&s;repre&s;ented them. This view of our con&s;titution &s;hews al&s;o the propriety of that emphatical and brilliant expre&s;&s;ion of Lord Camden, that&mdash;"that there was not a blade of gra&s;s which, when taxed, was not taxed by the con&s;ent of the proprietor."</P>
<P>That taxation and repre&s;entation are continually in&s;eparable, and that it was the fixed principle of government, that the property of the people could be given by their con&s;ent only, &s;ignified by their re|pre&s;entatives, cho&s;en by them&s;elves; appears beyond controver&s;y, both from general con&s;iderations, and from a variety of particular proofs, ari&s;ing from ancient and undoubted records.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="014147_0005_0F93542E8D7465A0">The general con&s;iderations which &s;upport the&s;e po&s;itions are&mdash;That it is an eternal law of nature, &s;o incident to, and in&s;eparable from the very idea of property, that no propriety can exi&s;t without it. "What|ever is a man's own, no other per&s;on can have a right to take from him, without his con&s;ent, expre&s;&s;ed by him&s;elf or his repre&s;entative. Who|ever attempts to do it, attempts an injury; whoever does it commits a robbery&mdash;he throws down and de&s;troys the di&s;tinction between liberty and &s;lavery." Nor is this the di&s;covery of Mr. Locke, or the peculiar provi&s;ion of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. It was long &s;ince &s;et forth by Cicero, in the&s;e words, <HI>Haec &s;unt fundamenta firmi&s;&s;ima libertatis, &s;ui quemque juris retinendi ac demittendi e&s;&s;e a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">itrium.</HI> "The power of giving and withholding is the &s;tronge&s;t foundation of liberty." It per|vaded every feudal con&s;titution in Europe, and was exerci&s;ed with as much preci&s;ion and jealou&s;y by the &s;tates of France and the cortes of Spain, as by the Engli&s;h hou&s;e of commons. <HI>Auxilia,</HI> &s;ays Bracton, <HI>fiunt de gratia, et non de jure; cum dependeant ex gratia tanentium, et non ad voluntatem dominorum.</HI> [L. 2. c. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">9.] "Aids are of favour, not of right, &s;ince they flow from the good-will of the tenant, not from the plea&s;ure of the lord." Dr. Robert&s;on tells us, "When any extra|ordinary aid was granted by freemen to their Sovereign, it was purely voluntary." [Hi&s;t. Charles V. p. 360.] And again, "It was a funda|mental principle in the feudal &s;y&s;tem of policy, that no freeman could be taxed unle&s;s by his own con&s;ent." [Ib. p. 36.] Every one knows, from the mo&s;t authentic accounts, that in the German con&s;titution, from its earlie&s;t date, all the people had a right to be pre&s;ent in their a&s;&s;emblies, and a&s;&s;ent to what bound them: <HI>De minoribus principes con&s;ultant; de majoribus omnes.</HI> [Tacitus.] "In ordinary affairs the chief decided; in extraordinary ones, the whole community." Hotoman informs us, that in France it was not lawful to debate on any thing concerning the commonwealth, but in the general council of the &s;tate. [Franco-Gallia, c. xi.] So tenacious were they in Spain of this general con&s;ent, that in the cortes it was nece&s;&s;ary every member &s;hould give his a&s;&s;ent before the act was binding. [Marteil Cort. de Arrag.] And I am well informed, that at this very day, no taxes can be rai&s;ed upon the free cities of Bru&s;&s;els, Antwerp, &amp;c. even by the Empre&s;s Queen, with|out the con&s;ent of every individual citizen who is pre&s;ent in the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>To the &s;acred, eternal, and univer&s;al right of giving property, even a tyrant of the north has been obliged to bear his te&s;timony. We have heard the pre&s;ent King of Sweden publicly declare to his people&mdash;that to be taxed by others was repugnant to the mo&s;t precious part of their liberty, which con&s;i&s;ts in taxing them&s;elves. "To this right," &s;ays he "of the nation to tax it&s;elf, I would have the greate&s;t attention paid, becau&s;e I am engaged by oath to let my &s;ubjects enjoy their liber|ties and privileges, without any re&s;triction."</P>
<P>From the&s;e external proofs and illu&s;trations of the doctrine, that the con&s;ent of the owner is e&s;&s;ential to the ju&s;t di&s;po&s;al of property, to that the &s;upreme power cannot, and never could, in any free &s;tate, take away any man's property without his con&s;ent, we now come to demon&s;trate it from the practice of our own con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is certain, that originally, and before the conque&s;t, the right of
<PB N="6" REF="014147_0006_0F93542F6D5B86C8">
being pre&s;ent in the great council of the nation, in which grants, if any, were made, belonging to every freeman in the kingdom. In an ancient record, quoted by my lord Coke, &s;o far back as the reign of Canute, in the year 1030, the Parliament is &s;aid to have con&s;i&s;ted not only of great men, but&mdash;<HI>quamplurimis gregariis militibus, ac cum populi multitudine copi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;a; ac omnibus adhuc in eodem Parliamento</HI> per&s;onaliter <HI>exi&s;tentibus votis regis</HI> unanimiter con&s;entientibus, <HI>praeceptum et decretum fuit.</HI> [Pref. to the 9th Rep.] "A great many common tenants, and a multitude of the people; it was ordained and decreed by all of them per&s;onally pre&s;ent, and unanimou&s;ly con&s;enting to the King's de&s;ire."</P>
<P>The &s;ame recognition of the right of a&s;&s;ent in every individual, to the di&s;po&s;al of his property, we find thus declared in <HI>Magna Charta:</HI> &mdash;"And for this our gift and grant of the&s;e liberties, and of other contained in our charter of liberties of our fore&s;t, the archbi&s;hops, bi|&s;hops, abbots, priors, earls, barons, knights, freeholders, and <HI>other our &s;ubjects,</HI> have given unto us the fifteeth part of all their moveables. [C. 37. Arl. 4.] It was not the &s;upreme power, whether you mean by that the King, or the Parliament, as it is now con&s;tituted, nor the repre&s;entatives of the people in Parliament a&s;&s;embled, but the people them&s;elves, every one having a right to be pre&s;ent and con&s;ent to the grant or di&s;po&s;al of his property.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame ground, the King, in the &s;tatute <HI>de tallagio non concedendo,</HI> declares, "that no tallage or aid &s;hall be taken or levied, by us, or our heirs, in our realm, without the good-will and a&s;&s;ent of the archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, earls, barons, knights, burge&s;&s;es, and <HI>other freemen of the land"</HI> [34 Edw. I. c. 1, 2.] And the more expre&s;sly to &s;hew how nece&s;&s;ary the con&s;ent of every individual was deemed, to the gifts which affected his property, the &s;ame &s;tatute &s;ays, "No officer of ours, or of our heirs, &s;hall take corn, leather, cattle, or any other goods of <HI>any manner of per&s;on,</HI> without the good-will and a&s;&s;ent of the <HI>party to whom the goods belong."</HI></P>
<P>Edward I, or the Engli&s;h Ju&s;tinian, was the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t magna|nimous of our princes; and as he had too much ju&s;tice to refu&s;e what he knew to be the inherent right of his people, &s;o he had too much wi&s;dom and courage to be deluded or compelled into a conce&s;&s;ion which was not &s;trictly con&s;titutional. This &s;tatute is therefore de&s;ervedly held in great veneration, and is of high authority. M. de Lolme, a very &s;agacious re&s;earcher into the principles of our con&s;titution, calls it, "an important &s;tatute, which, in conjunction with <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> forms the ba&s;is of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. If it is from the latter," &s;ays he, "that the Engli&s;h ought to date the origin of their liberty, it is to the former they owe its &s;ecurity. If the Great Charter is the rampart that defends the liberties of every individual, it is this &s;tatute that protects the Grand Charter it&s;elf; and by which the people were enabled to make the law &s;uperior to the will of the crown." [Con&s;tit. de l'Angleterre, p. 28.]</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of time, the acting by deputation, which was adopted for convenience at fir&s;t, became a &s;ettled practice. Still, however, no freeman of whatever denomination, was denied the right of voting for him who was to &s;ignify his a&s;&s;ent, or be his repre&s;entative in Parlia|ment,
<PB N="7" REF="014147_0007_0F9354316004F1F8">
till the reign of Henry VI, when that right was re&s;tricted to per|&s;ons having a freehold of forty &s;hillings annual value. [It may be well que&s;tioned (according to the principles of Mr. Locke) whether Parlia|ment had any ju&s;t right to take away from its con&s;tituents &s;o e&s;&s;ential a privilege.</P>
<P>This alteration in the &s;y&s;tem introduced two kinds of repre&s;entation: real and virtual. They who retained the right of voting, were really repre&s;ented; they that did not vote, but were &s;hielded and &s;ecured in their portion of property by the electors and elected bearing their pro|portion in the grants made, were virtually repre&s;ented. Still, however, as the real electors though greatly circum&s;cribed in number, owned far the greater part of the lay property of the kingdom, the original idea of the grants being made by common con&s;ent continued, and governed all the parliamentary forms in voting &s;upplies. The commons are &s;aid to give and grant, the King thanks his good people for their benevo|lence, and the Lords are not permitted to originate, alter, or amend a money bill. There is but one in&s;tance within my knowledge, in which the Hou&s;e of Lords were &s;uffered to violate this rule. This was in the time of Richard the &s;econd, wherein the Hou&s;e of Commons are &s;aid to have a&s;&s;ented to an impo&s;ition which originated in the Upper Hou&s;e. It is true, that on the patent roll, 3 Edward I. and in a variety of other in&s;tances they gave &s;eparately, and of their own property; but the&s;e are additional proofs how prevalent the idea was, that property could be given only and ab&s;olutely by tho&s;e who owned it.</P>
<P>Lord Clarenden, &s;ays, the origin of &s;upplies in the Commons had never been di&s;puted in the wor&s;t of times, and that the Lords acknowledged it in 1640. We are told in the Ca&s;e Stated, [p. 113] a work known to be written under the in&s;pection of the Lords, that the Lords &s;ay, "As to what concerns their rights and privileges, they pretend not to be the beginners of any charge, to be laid on the e&s;tates of the &s;ubject, nor to encrea&s;e or augment any that is already laid by the Hou&s;e of Commons. This they conceive to be again&s;t the intendment of the law, 9 H. 4. and the practice of parliaments ever &s;ince."</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible that any one can, con&s;i&s;tent with common &s;en&s;e, deduce the &s;ole and incommunicable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this right of giving and grant|ing by the Hou&s;e of Commons, from any other origin than that of their repre&s;enting the people? This proof, therefore, would be alone &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that both in the principles and practice of the con&s;titution, re|pre&s;entation and taxation are in&s;eparable, and that it is not the three &s;tates, but tho&s;e whom the people elect, who repre&s;ent them.</P>
<P>But this po&s;ition is &s;till farther &s;upported by the con&s;tant practice of the clergy in convocation. The clergy were &s;ubject to the general controul and &s;uperintending power of the &s;upreme legi&s;lature; but par|liament never attempted to tax them, while they were repre&s;ented in convocation, and not in the Hou&s;e of Commons. Whenever they con|tributed to the &s;upport of government, they did it by their own con&s;ent, &s;ignified in their convocation, in which my Ld. Coke &s;ays, they were all by repre&s;entation, or in per&s;on pre&s;ent. [7 Co. 73.] It appears by the roll of the 4 Rec. 2. No. 13, 14. that when the Hou&s;e of Commons offered to grant an aid, if the clergy would pay one third, as they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="8" REF="014147_0008_0F93543216EBB0E8">
a third of the realm, the clergy an&s;wered, they were not to grant aids by parliament, and therefore willed the Commons to do their duty and they would do theirs. This is in effect the language of America, yet it is idly called a <HI>new-fangled</HI> doctrine. A doctrine as old as the con&s;titution it&s;elf, interwoven in its very &s;tamina, drawn from the fir&s;t principles of natural ju&s;tice, and e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;tence of property.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e general views of the con&s;titution, both in its principles and practice, it appears to be one uniform and inviolable rule, that <HI>property could not be given but by con&s;ent.</HI> Whether that con&s;ent was &s;ignified in per&s;on, or by repre&s;entation, was a matter merely of con|venience. So much &s;o indeed, that every one knows, the repre&s;enta|tives were formerly paid for their trouble in attending on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the whole. The act of Henry the &s;ixth, which pre&s;cribed a qualifi|cation for electors, regulated the exerci&s;e, but did not aboli&s;h the right; for there is a manife&s;t and eternal difference between regulating the mode in which a right may be enjoyed, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a principle which entirely annihilates that right. To e&s;tabli&s;h the power of the Bri|ti&s;h parliament to give and grant the property of the people of America, is mo&s;t clearly to annihilate their right of con&s;enting to the di&s;po&s;al of that property, in whole or in part, in per&s;on or by repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>How far this is con&s;i&s;tent with the exi&s;tence of property, with the principles and practice of all free con&s;titutions, and e&s;pecially of our own, I have already furni&s;hed the reader with the general means of judging. I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew, that the &s;ame principle pervades and governs the particular in&s;tances, in which it was nece&s;&s;ary that <HI>di&s;tinct parts</HI> of the empire &s;hould contribute to the &s;upport of government, in doing which their own con&s;ent was always deemed indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>In the tenth year of Edward the fir&s;t, this prince being under a nece&s;|&s;ity of demanding &s;upplies, applied to his &s;ubjects in Ireland, &s;eparately to &s;olicit a loan to enable him to carry on the war again&s;t Wales [Rym, ex Rol. Wall. 10 Ed. I. Leland, v. 1. p. 248.]. Un&s;ettled as the &s;tate of Ireland then was, the right of granting their own property, was con&s;i|dered as &s;o e&s;&s;ential to an Engli&s;h &s;ubject, that the application was not made to the parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, but to the people them&s;elves, who&s;e money was to be given.</P>
<P>When the &s;ame prince was again in di&s;tre&s;s, he applied fir&s;t to the clergy of Ireland, for an additional fifteenth of the &s;piritualities, and they peremptorily refu&s;ed to comply with the requi&s;ition. The king re|&s;pected the right of refu&s;ing, though the refu&s;al it&s;elf was &s;o grievous a di&s;appointment to him. He therefore neither called in the ab&s;olute power of his Engli&s;h parliament, nor of his army to enforce the requi|&s;ition, but applied to the laity of Ireland, from whom he received more &s;atisfaction. Dr. Leland tells us, "that after &s;ome altercation and delay, they granted him a fifteenth of their effects." [Leland, p. 251.] Thus, this magnanimous prince, well &s;atisfied that it was the inherent right of an Engli&s;h &s;ubject, not to have his property taken from him, but by his own con&s;ent, given by him&s;elf, or by his repre&s;entative cho&s;en by him&s;elf, whether that &s;ubject was in England or Ireland, he applied to him or to his repre&s;entative for the &s;upplies which were to ari&s;e out of his property.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="014147_0009_0F9354350CFED7E0">But we find the in&s;eparable connection of repre&s;entation and taxa|tion &s;till more irrefragably proved, in the reign of Edward the third. I will &s;tate the words in the language of Dr. Leland. It is di&s;tingui&s;h|ed and deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>"The parliament of England grew unea&s;y under the burden of &s;up|porting the king's Iri&s;h dominions; they remon&s;trated; they &s;olicited, that &s;trict inquiry &s;hould be made into the deficiencies of the royal re|venues in this realm. The king was no le&s;s impatient to find any part of the &s;upplies de&s;tined to his military &s;ervice, diverted to a purpo&s;e which he deemed of much le&s;s moment, the &s;upport of a di&s;ordered govern|ment in Ireland. An agent, called Nicholas Dagworth, was di&s;patched into this country: his in&s;tructions were to repre&s;ent the nece&s;&s;ities of the crown, and the grievous deficiencies of the Iri&s;h revenue; to con|vince the king's mini&s;ters of the nece&s;&s;ity of exerting them&s;elves for the intere&s;t of their royal ma&s;ter. It was particularly directed, that an Iri&s;h parliament &s;hould be convened without delay, for the purpo&s;e of grant|ing &s;uch a liberal &s;ub&s;idy, as &s;hould provide not only for the exigen|cies of their own &s;tate, but for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their &s;overeign in his foreign wars. The parliament was a&s;&s;embled; <HI>they pleaded the po|verty of the realm, and refu&s;ed the &s;upplies.</HI> Edward was provoked; he i&s;&s;ued his writs of &s;ummons both to the clergy and laity. The bi&s;hops were commanded to choo&s;e two of the clergy in each dioce&s;e: the commons to choo&s;e two lay men in each county, to repre&s;ent the lords and commons in that county; the cities and boroughs in like manner, each to elect two citizens and burge&s;&s;es. The a&s;&s;embly was directed to repair to the King in England, to treat, con&s;ult, and agree with him and his council, as well on the government of the land of Ireland, as the aid and &s;upport of the King's war."</P>
<P>We have the an&s;wers of the archbi&s;hop of Armagh, and of the county of Dublin, to this &s;ummons di&s;tinctly recorded, "We are not bound, &s;aid the prelate, agreeable to the liberties, rights, laws and cu&s;toms of the church and land of Ireland, to elect any of our clergy, and to &s;end them to any part of England, for the purpo&s;e of holding parliaments or councils in England; yet on account of our reverence to our lord the King of England, and the now eminent nece&s;&s;ity of the land afore&s;aid, &s;aving to us, and to the Lords and Commons of the &s;aid land, all rights, privileges, liberties, laws and cu&s;toms before men|tioned, we have elected repre&s;entatives to repair to the king in England, to treat and con&s;ult with him and his council; except, however, that we do by no means grant to our &s;aid repre&s;entatives any power of a&s;&s;enting to any burthens or &s;ub&s;idies to be impo&s;ed on us or our clergy, to which we cannot yield, by rea&s;on of our poverty and daily expence in defending the land again&s;t the Iri&s;h enemy.</P>
<P>In like manner we find the county of Dublin at fir&s;t elected their repre&s;entatives, without power or authority to con&s;ent to the impo&s;ition of any burdens. The King complained of the election as in&s;ufficient and irregular, and the &s;heriff was directed to make another return, in pre&s;ence of the trea&s;urer and chief Ju&s;tice of the King's Bench. Difficu|lties were &s;tarted and delays contrived; at length the nobles and com|mons unanimou&s;ly and with one voice declare, that, according to the
<PB N="10" REF="014147_0010_0F93543549D4EFF0">
rights, privileges, liberties, laws and cu&s;toms of the land of Ireland, en|joyed from the time of the conque&s;t of the &s;aid land, they are not bound to &s;end any per&s;ons from the land of Ireland to the parliament or council of our lord the King in England, to treat, con&s;ult, or agree with our lord the King in England, as the writ requires. Notwith&s;tanding, on account of their reverence, and the nece&s;&s;ity and pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s of the &s;aid land, they have elected repre&s;entatives to repair to the King, and to treat and con&s;ult with him and his council, re&s;erving to them&s;elves the power of yielding or agreeing to any &s;ub&s;ides. At the &s;ame time prote&s;ting, that their pre&s;ent compliance is not hereafter to be taken in prejudice to the rights, privileges, laws and cu&s;toms, which the lords and com|mons, from the time of the conque&s;t of the land of Ireland, have enjoyed.</P>
<P>What was the re&s;ult of this notable controver&s;y between Edward and his &s;ubjects of Ireland, or whether or how far the King's nece&s;&s;ities were &s;upplied, we are not di&s;tinctly informed. It only appears, that the Iri&s;h repre&s;entatives &s;at at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and that their wages were levied on the dioce&s;es, counties and boroughs which had cho&s;en them." [Ibid. p. 327.]</P>
<P>The unque&s;tionable conclu&s;ion from this record is, that to give and grant the property of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, in an a&s;&s;embly wherein they were not pre&s;ent in per&s;on or by repre&s;entation, was deemed &s;o uncon&s;ti|tutional, that no nece&s;&s;ity could prompt or ju&s;tify it. The Parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter did not con&s;ider this doctrine as repugnant to their rights, or trenching upon their authority; though they were by no means di&s;po&s;ed to yield any of their privileges to the crown, or permit an illegal exertion of the prerogative. This record is al&s;o a proof that the &s;ole right of giving was &s;o inherent in the owner of property, that the people at large might delegate it in whole or in part; might re&s;train it entirely, or re&s;erve to them&s;elves the controul of con&s;enting to the grant of their repre&s;entatives, to give its final efficacy. It appears too, from the writs i&s;&s;ued upon that occa&s;ion, that every per&s;on concerned, without any farther qualification in the conduct of the repre&s;enta|tives, was to give his voice in electing them. The words of the writ are, <HI>Archiopi&s;copis, epi&s;copis, vice-comitibus, &s;ene&s;callis, majoribus, &s;upe|rioribus &amp; praepo&s;itis, ac</HI> omnibus aliis eju&s;dem terrae quorum intere&s;t, <HI>ad electionem huju&s;modi duarum per&s;onarum, in Angliam in forma praedic|ta tran&s;mittendarum, faciendam.</HI> [Appendix to Leland's hi&s;t. p. 365.] "Archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, &s;heriffs, &s;ene&s;chals, elders, &s;uperiors, and offi|cers, and to all others of the &s;ame land whom it concerns, to elect two per&s;ons to be &s;ent into England as afore&s;aid."</P>
<P>In tracing the hi&s;tory of the Iri&s;h parliaments, we find they not only knew their right of granting money, but how in&s;trumental it was in ob|taining a redre&s;s of grievances. In the reign of Henry the fifth, they accompanied the grant with a repre&s;entation of grievances. [Leland, v. 2. p. 13.] In the year 1585, the ordinary &s;ub&s;idy bill was rejected by the commons of Ireland; the rea&s;on appears to have been a com|plaint of grievances, and an apprehen&s;ion of more, e&s;pecially of op|pre&s;&s;ive and extraordinary taxation. [Ibid. v. 2. p. 296.] Queen Elizabeth, during who&s;e reign this happened, had two much &s;pirit to have acquie&s;ced in this refu&s;al, could &s;he or any one about her have
<PB N="11" REF="014147_0011_0F935439A26924A0">
conceived that the intervention of her Engli&s;h Parliament, might grant the &s;ub&s;idy out of the property of the people of Ireland, without the mo&s;t flagrant violation of their con&s;titutional rights. Neither is it probable that the Iri&s;h commons would have hazarded &s;uch a mea&s;ure of oppo&s;ition, had they imagined them&s;elves liable to be taxed in the Engli&s;h Parliament, and thereby deprived of this means of enforcing a redre&s;s of grievances. In the reign of James the fir&s;t, we find them re&s;tored to good humour by conciliatory mea&s;ures; and then they granted a liberal &s;ub&s;idy, with &s;o much alacrity and zeal, that the King re|turned them thanks, in a flattering letter addre&s;&s;ed to the Lord Lieute|nant [Ibid. p. 457.] Charles the fir&s;t and his favourite Wentworth, tried every art to per&s;uade them to make liberal and permanent grants; the threat of interpo&s;ing the King's prerogative was added. Under the influence of promi&s;es and fears, the commons made a grant of four entire &s;ub&s;idies. [Iri&s;h Journ. 1640.] Neither the King nor his deputy were &s;incere; the graces they promi&s;ed were not granted; the commons therefore contrived a method of fru&s;trating the collection of the &s;ub&s;idy, and the civil wars which &s;oon followed put an end to all further requi&s;itions.</P>
<P>I have been more particular in &s;tating the&s;e facts with relation to Ireland, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to find a ca&s;e more exactly &s;imilar to that of America. They were both conquered countries, peopled by Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. Yet in all the agitation of nece&s;&s;ity and Pa&s;&s;ion, and the various expediments it produced, that of impo&s;ing taxes upon Ireland in the Engli&s;h parliament was never attempted.</P>
<P>There are however &s;ome differences in favour of America. In the former, the conquered people and the Engli&s;h were in &s;ome mea&s;ure intermixed; in the latter, they were and &s;till continue totally di&s;tinct. The Engli&s;h &s;ubjects who &s;ettled in Ireland carried with them their rights, not expre&s;&s;ed but latent; whereas tho&s;e of the American &s;ettlers were confirmed by charters. I am far from thinking that charters cre|ate rights; the&s;e are inherent in and unalienable from the per&s;on of the &s;ubject. Allegience and protection in the&s;e rights are a mutual com|pact between the prince and the people. As emigration does not di&s;|&s;olve allegience, neither can it dive&s;t rights: they involve each other, and are in&s;eparable. But &s;o &s;olemn a recognition and confirmation of them, as charters under the great &s;eal of a kingdom, renders the violation of them &s;till more con&s;picuous and criminal. From the hi&s;tory of Ireland we learn another difference, which is, that taxes were levied in England to defend and protect that country for &s;ome time after its &s;ettlement; whereas all the old colonies in America were &s;ettled, and the wars carried on with the natives, &s;olely at the expence of the &s;ettlers them&s;elves; this country bearing none of the burthen, but reaping infinite benefits from the &s;ettlement. Canada, Florida, and Nova Scotia, are exceptions to this; but they are acqui&s;itions obtain|ed from France and Spain, which belong therefore to this country, and will &s;oon repay with intere&s;t the &s;upplies which have been voted for them.</P>
<P>As it was therefore mo&s;t clearly con&s;idered, that Engli&s;h &s;ubjects emi|grating to and &s;ettling in Ireland, though a conquered country, were
<PB N="12" REF="014147_0012_0F93543A5DFF5DF8">
not liable to be taxed by the Engli&s;h parliament, it &s;eems &s;trange to contend that the &s;ame &s;ubjects &s;ettling in America were liable to &s;uch taxation. The &s;upreme power of this parliament has been always a&s;&s;erted and frequently exerci&s;ed over Ireland: the right of giving and grant|ing their money for the purpo&s;es of a revenue, never. Who is it that can point out a difference adequate to &s;o great a diminution of Eng|li&s;h liberty, in the per&s;on of him who emigrates to America, as that he &s;hall not only be &s;ubject to the &s;upreme power of the Briti&s;h par|liament, but to be taxed where he is not repre&s;ented?</P>
<P>Now it is not only impo&s;&s;ible, I conceive, to give any plau&s;ible rea|&s;on for this di&s;tinction, but it is clear that no &s;uch idea was ever &s;eri|ou&s;ly entertained till the year 1764. What can be a more deci&s;ive proof of this, than that the people of America have always cho&s;en repre|&s;entatives of their own, and that the crown has con&s;tantly applied to tho&s;e repre&s;entatives for the &s;upplies which were wanting? If the &s;ettled, notorious, invariable practice of government, be not evidence of the con&s;titution, from whence are we to learn it? If it had not been con|&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;titution, and e&s;&s;ential to the free &s;tate of an Engli&s;h &s;ubject, that he &s;hould choo&s;e repre&s;entatives who only &s;hould impo&s;e taxes upon him, how did it happen that both in Ireland and America our coloni&s;ts, without any &s;pecial law to direct it, from their earlie&s;t infancy cho&s;e &s;uch repre&s;entatives, who have always exerci&s;ed that authority? Had this been illegal, &s;urely the crown would not have encouraged it, by con&s;tantly making requi&s;ition thro' its governors, and giving a&s;&s;ent to laws, impo&s;ing taxes by the authority of provincial a&s;&s;emblies; nor would parliament have permitted a practice, which makes tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies coequal with them&s;elves. It is, I apprehend, mo&s;t undenia|ble, that either parliament has no right to impo&s;e taxes upon the peo|ple of Ireland and America, or they have the &s;ole right; for no|thing can be &s;o ab&s;urd as to &s;uppo&s;e a people &s;ubject to two taxing pow|ers, not communicating with each other, not knowing what each other are doing; in con&s;equence of which the people might be burthened with a double tax upon the &s;ame thing, &s;o as to be productive of per|petual confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s. This would plainly be &s;uch an incon&s;i&s;tency in politics, as would render government at once ridiculous and op|pre&s;&s;ive. The a&s;&s;ertion therefore at this day, of the right of parlia|ment to impo&s;e taxes upon Ireland and America, involves in it the highe&s;t criminal charge again&s;t all tho&s;e who have for centuries been active or acquie&s;cing in the impo&s;ition of taxes upon the people of tho&s;e countries, which, according to the modern doctrine, the authority of parliament only could impo&s;e. If they ju&s;tify by pleading that they were the repre&s;entatives of the people who&s;e money they granted, the admi&s;&s;ion of that plea will defeat the preten&s;ions of parliament, who do not repre&s;ent them.</P>
<P>There is a &s;olemn re&s;olution of the hou&s;e of commons, that no talli|age, loan, benevolence, or other like charge, ought to be commanded or levied by the king or any of his mini&s;ters, without common con|&s;ent of parliamet. If it had been imagined that this re&s;olution conclu|ded to all the &s;ubjects of the empire, if an idea had been entertained, that the con&s;ent of parliament involved in it the con&s;ent of Ireland
<PB N="13" REF="014147_0013_0F93543B2793CA48">
and America, what mini&s;ter would have ventured to advi&s;e the king to a&s;k money from the commons of Ireland and of America, and to have levied it upon the people by the authority of their legi&s;lators? Every mini&s;ter who gave &s;uch advice, would have hazarded his head; no parliament would have endured &s;o open a violation of its rights and of the con&s;titution. But no &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ition ever entered into any man's head, and therefore it has been the e&s;tabli&s;hed and unimpeached practice, ever &s;ince the foundation of our dominion in tho&s;e countries, for the king to make requi&s;itions for &s;upplies to their repre&s;entatives, and levy taxes by the authority of their legi&s;latures. The in&s;tances of this are innumerable. It has been done by every mini&s;ter, at all times, and in every reign. It has been repeatedly announced with regard to America, to the hou&s;e of commons, in the King's me&s;&s;ages, without que&s;tion or complaint. It remained for the new-fangled doctrine of this day to maintain that America was repre&s;ented in parliament. A doctrine involving con&s;equences which they who breached it were far from fore&s;eeing. It would devote their deare&s;t connections to impeach|ment, and brand the memory of every mini&s;ter who preceded, as a traitor to the con&s;titution of his country.</P>
<P>That repre&s;entation and taxation were ever deemed in&s;eparable, the following copy of a petition from the county palatine of Che&s;ter, in 1450, is an eminent proof.</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t chri&s;tian, benign, and gracious king, we your humble &s;ub|jects, and true, obai&s;ant, liege people, the abbots, priors, and all the clergy, your barons, knights and e&s;quires, and all the commonalty of your county palatine of Che&s;ter, meekly prayen and be&s;eechen your highne&s;s&mdash;Where the &s;aid county is and hath been a county palatine, as well before the conque&s;t of England as continually &s;ince, di&s;tinct and &s;eparate from the crown of England; within which county you and all your noble progenitors, &s;ithen it came into your hands, have had your high courts of parliament&mdash;and no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ioners or inheritors within the &s;aid county be not chargeable or liable, nor have not been bounden, charged or hurt of their bodies, liberties, franchi&s;es, lands, goods, nor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions within the &s;ame county, but by &s;uch laws as they have agreed unto&mdash;and al&s;o, they have no knights, citizens, na burge&s;&s;es, na ever had, of the &s;aid county, to any parliament holden out of the &s;aid county, whereby they might in any way of rea&s;on be boun|den &mdash; which franchi&s;es, notwith&s;tanding there be your commi&s;&s;ioners di|rected out in &s;everal commi&s;&s;ioners of the &s;ame county, for the levy of &s;ub&s;idy, granted by the commons of your land, in your parliament late begun at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and ended at Leice&s;ter, to make levy thereof with|in the &s;aid county, after the form of their grant thereof, contrary to the liberties, freedoms and franchi&s;es of the &s;aid county and inheritance of the &s;ame, at all times before this time u&s;ed, that plea&s;e your noble grace, of your noble &s;avour, the premi&s;es graciou&s;ly to con&s;ider, and hereupon to di&s;charge all &s;uch commi&s;&s;ioners of levy of the &s;aid &s;ub&s;idy, within the &s;aid county, and of your &s;pecial mere grace, ever to &s;ee, that there be never act in this parliament, nor in any parliament hereafter holden out of the &s;aid county, made to the hurt of any of the inheri|tors or inheritance of the &s;aid county, of their bodies, liberties, fran|chi&s;es,

goods, lands, tenements or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, being within the &s;aid county. For if any &s;uch act &s;hould be made, it were clean contrary to the liberties, freedoms, immunities, and franchi&s;es of &s;aid county," &amp;c.</P>
<P>ANSWER. "The King's will is, to the &s;ub&s;idy in this bill contain|ed&mdash;Forasmuch as he is learned, that the be&s;eechers in the &s;ame, their predece&s;&s;ors nor ance&s;tors, have not been charged afore this time, by authority of any Parliament holden out of the &s;aid county, of any quindi&s;ma or &s;ub&s;idy, granted to him or any of his progenitors in any &s;uch Parliament, that the be&s;eechers and each of them be di&s;charg|ed of the paying and levy of the &s;aid &s;ub&s;idy, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c."</P>
<P>This petition and an&s;wer require no comment: they plainly recog|nize, that to impo&s;e taxes where the right of doing it is not delegat|ed, was unu&s;ual and uncon&s;titutional. The &s;ame principle operated in forming acts of the legi&s;lature for repre&s;entatives to be &s;ent from Wales and the county of Durham to the Engli&s;h Parliament, and on the crown to i&s;&s;ue writs to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, when it became a part of the empire. It was invariably conceived, that the property of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, connected with the general dominion, could not be granted but in an a&s;&s;embly where they were repre&s;ented. Upon this principle our con&s;titution manife&s;tly &s;tands; and to &s;ub|vert the one, would in effect be to overthrow the other. The practice of every free &s;tate, e&s;pecially of England; the practice of Ireland, Che&s;ter, Wales, and Calais, as members of the empire; the con&s;titution of the church, and the very nature of property&punc; all con&s;pire to &s;hew, that this principle is the e&s;&s;ential right of the &s;ubject in every part of the dominion. The right of property is the guardian of every other right, and to deprive a people of this, is in fact to deprive them of their liberty.</P>
<P>Let me now have leave to &s;hew, that the&s;e have been invariably the &s;entiments of tho&s;e great men, whom we allow to be the be&s;t ac|quainted with our con&s;titution, and its firme&s;t defenders.</P>
<P>"I will begin," &s;ays Sir Edward Coke, "with a noble record&mdash; It chears me to think of it, the 26th of Edward III. it is worthy to be written in letters of gold&mdash;"Loans again&s;t the will of the &s;ubject, are again&s;t rea&s;on and the franchi&s;es of the land."&mdash;What a word is that <HI>franchi&s;e!</HI> The lord may tax his villain, high or low, but it is again&s;t the franchi&s;es of the land for <HI>freemen to be taxed but by their own con&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>The rea&s;oning of Mr. Locke is &s;o clear and conclu&s;ive, and his au|thority &s;o great, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to give the words of Sidney and Milton, who&s;e opinions were preci&s;ely the &s;ame.</P>
<P>"The &s;upreme powers cannot," &s;ays Mr. Locke, "take from any man any part of his property, without his own con&s;ent. For the pre&s;ervation of property being the end of government, and that from which men enter into &s;ociety, it nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es and requires that the people &s;hould have property, without which they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have lo&s;t that by entering into &s;ociety, which was the end for which they entered into it&mdash;too gro&s;s an ab&s;urdity for any man to own. Men, therefore, in &s;ociety, having property, they have &s;uch a right to the goods which by the law of the community are theirs, that nobody hath
<PB N="15" REF="014147_0015_0F93543DCAAD3EF0">
a right to take their &s;ub&s;tance, or any part of it, without their own con&s;ent. Without this they have no property at all: for I truly have no property in that which another can of right take from me, when he plea&s;es, without my con&s;ent. Hence, it is a mi&s;take to think that the &s;upreme or legi&s;lative power of any commonwealth can do what it will, and di&s;po&s;e of the e&s;tates of the &s;ubject arbitarily, or take any part of them at plea&s;ure." [On government, fol. p. 197.]</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible an expre&s;s advocate for America could &s;peak more explicitly to the point, and Mr. Locke's argument is evidently found|ed on the &s;tatute <HI>de tollagio non co<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">edendo,</HI> which declares, that the goods of no manner of per&s;on &s;hall be taken, without the good-will and a&s;&s;ent of the party to whom the goods belong; and upon a &s;olemn re|&s;olution of the Hou&s;e of Commons, which maintains that the ancient and undoubted rights of every freeman are, that he hath a full and ab&s;o|lute property in his goods and e&s;tate, and that no talliage, loan, bene|volence, or other like charge, ought to be commanded or levied by the king, or any of his mini&s;ters, without common con&s;ent in parlia|ment. [Com. Journ. V. 1. p. 878.] I have already &s;hewn, that it never was the idea that the common con&s;ent of America was given in the parliament of England; the term did not even include the clergy, who never were taxed in it till they were repre&s;ented; and who told the commons, in the record I before cited, that they were not to be taxed there; to which the commons a&s;&s;ented. The doctrine was held neither novel, in&s;olent, nor uncon&s;titutional; and the practice was uniform, notorious, and uncontroverted.</P>
<P>Taking up then the American que&s;tion on this con&s;titutional ground; either the Americans are not freemen, or to impo&s;e taxes upon them in parliament, in which not one of them is repre&s;ented and therefore cannot give his con&s;ent, is to dive&s;t them of all property, and di&s;&s;olve the original compact upon which, according to Mr. Locke, they entered into &s;ociety. The&s;e con&s;iderations mark the propriety of what my Lord Camden urged with &s;o much real eloquence in his unan&s;werable &s;peech again&s;t the declaratory bill. "My po&s;ition is this&mdash;I repeat it &mdash;I will maintain it to my la&s;t hour&mdash;Taxation and repre&s;entation are in&s;eparable. This po&s;ition is founded on the laws of nature. It is more &mdash;it is it&s;elf an eternal law of nature. For whatever is a man's own, is ab&s;olutely his own&mdash;no man has a right to take it from him without his con&s;ent. Whoever attempts to do it, attempts an injury&mdash;who|ever does it, commits a robbery; he throws down and de&s;troys the di&s;|&s;tinction between liberty and &s;lavery."</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e principles our own con&s;titution &s;tands; upon the&s;e prin|ciples the American claim is founded. If they are fallacious, then were our own claims u&s;urpations upon the crown, and the glorious revolu|tion it&s;elf was nothing more than a &s;ucce&s;sful rebellion; Hampden, Pym, Sidney and Ru&s;&s;el, than whom Greece with all her patriots, and Rome with all her heroes, produced no men who trod this mortal &s;tage with more dignity, or quitted it with greater lu&s;tre, were &s;turdy traitors. Surely tho&s;e preten&s;ions to impo&s;e taxes in America, cannot be ju&s;t, which &s;o manife&s;tly &s;ubvert, in principle, the foundation of our con|&s;titutional liberties!</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="014147_0016_0F93543E1D36BAB0">That this claim and right of giving their property by their own con|&s;ent, &s;ignified by their repre&s;entatives, is not novel, but coeval with their exi&s;tence as colonies; will fully appear from the following proof.</P>
<P>In 1620 the colony of Virginia, then in its very infancy, cho&s;e re|pre&s;entatives, by whom only they have been taxed from that time till 1764. It was not by charter that they e&s;tabli&s;hed and enjoyed this privilege, but by the operation of tho&s;e rights which are inherent in Engli&s;hmen, in whatever part of the dominion they inhabit. The &s;ame plan of government was pur&s;ued in every colony in America. In truth, an Engli&s;hman had no idea of any other con&s;titution, and always con&s;idered it as the ba&s;is of public liberty.</P>
<P>In 1625 King Charles fir&s;t &s;ignified his intention of &s;ub&s;tituting a governor and council as the legi&s;lature in Virginia. Upon this a general di&s;quietude and di&s;&s;atisfaction prevailed through the colony. The a&s;&s;embly remon&s;trated again&s;t it, as "as an a&s;&s;ault upon their rights and privileges." In con&s;equence of this, the privy council at la&s;t &s;ent them a letter, dated the 22d of July, 1634, containing the royal a&s;&s;urance and confirmation of their e&s;tates, trade, freedom and privileges. Upon the di&s;&s;olution of monarchy, the commonwealth di&s;patched a governor with a &s;quadron to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Virginia. He was per|mitted to land upon articles, of which the following is one, and de|ci&s;ively &s;hews what were their original ideas of their rights. <HI>Article fourth,</HI> "Virginia &s;hall be free from all taxes, cu&s;toms and impo&s;itions what&s;oever, and none &s;hall be impo&s;ed on them without con&s;ent of the general a&s;&s;embly."</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly of New-York, in 1708, re&s;olved, "That it is, and always has been, the unque&s;tionable right of every freeman in this colony, that he hath a perfect and entire property in his goods and e&s;tate. That the impo&s;ing taxes, and levying of any monies upon her Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects of this colony, under any pretence or colour what|&s;oever, without con&s;ent in general a&s;&s;embly, is a grievance, and a vio|lation of the people's property." [Smith's Hi&s;tory of New-York, p. 115.]</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, that this right of giving their money by their own con&s;ent alone, has been always claimed, a&s;&s;erted, and exerci&s;ed by the Americans; and that the crown and parliament as con&s;tantly recognized the exerci&s;e of it, till the year 1764. Let the right therefore re&s;ide really where it will, it is very clear that the novelty of claiming it is on our &s;ide. But if the uniform claim and exerci&s;e of a right, with our as uniform recognition and acquie&s;cence for one hundred and fifty years, will not render it clear and unimpeachable, I know not by what lap&s;e of time, or by what circum&s;tances, the enjoyment of any privi|lege can be rendered &s;acred and &s;ecure.</P>
<P>It is plain that there was no period of their exi&s;tence at which the colonies would not have reclaimed again&s;t an attempt to rai&s;e taxes upon them without the con&s;ent and grant of their repre&s;entatives. With what truth then can the pre&s;ent oppo&s;ition to it be imputed to a &s;pirit of di&s;affection, and a de&s;ire to throw off all dependence upon the parent &s;tate? That dependence and &s;ubordination would remain the &s;ame that it ever was or ought to be, were the exerci&s;e of this novel,
<PB N="17" REF="014147_0017_0F93543EDC7C9658">
odious, and unprofitable claim di&s;owned and aboli&s;hed. There is a mo&s;t material difference between a &s;ubject and a &s;lave; between &s;ubor|dination and &s;lavery. The Americans are &s;ubordinate, when we controul them, for our own advantage in the means of acquiring property; when we add to that, the practice of taking the property &s;o acquired at our plea&s;ure, they are &s;laves. What right have we, or can we have, to make them &s;laves? In my opinion we &s;hall lo&s;e them as &s;ubjects by attem|pting to hold them as &s;laves. When that happens we &s;hall be compleat|ly undone.</P>
<P>There are however &s;ome arguments again&s;t the po&s;ition, that pro|perty can only be taken by con&s;ent, which are plau&s;ible, and have had &s;uch an effect as makes them worthy of examination.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that a great part of the people of England are not repre|&s;ented, and yet they are all taxed. This is granted, but how will it conclude to America? Becau&s;e our repre&s;entation here is imperfect, therefore it &s;hall be aboli&s;hed in America&mdash;becau&s;e &s;ome in England are taxed without their con&s;ent, therefore all in America &s;hall be treated in the &s;ame manner. The Americans are not contending that every man in America &s;hall vote for a repre&s;entative, or not be taxed; if they were, this would be a good an&s;wer, "We are our&s;elves but parti|ally repre&s;ented; why &s;hould the &s;ubordinate require more &s;ecurity than the &s;upreme &s;tate?" But to the American que&s;tion this argument is utterly inapplicable. The &s;ecurity of property, as Mr. Locke and common rea&s;on tell us, is the great end of repre&s;entation. It is equal enough when that end is obtained. Now from the participation of the elected and the electors with the non-electors in the taxes which are impo&s;ed, the latter, as I before ob&s;erved, have a virtual &s;ecurity, which is equal to that of tho&s;e who do elect. But in the ca&s;e of the Ame|ricans there is no &s;uch participation, and con&s;equently no &s;uch virtual &s;ecurity. Nay, on the contrary, as the givers of the money of the Americans (&s;uppo&s;e them to be the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons) &s;ave their own property and that of their con&s;tituents exactly in proportion to their lavi&s;hing that of the Americans, there is a temptation to extor|tion and extravagance, and therefore a virtual in&s;ecurity of property, which is overturning the very foundation of government. If, for ex|ample, a tax is laid on Manche&s;ter, Birmingham and Sheffield, the &s;ame is borne by London, Bri&s;tol and York; but let Bo&s;ton, New-York and Philadelphia be taxed, will London, Bri&s;tol and York, &s;hare in the burthen of the impo&s;ition? The real &s;ituation of the unrepre&s;ented in England, and the people of America if &s;ubject to the &s;ame power of taxation in the Briti&s;h parliament, would be ju&s;t as different as &s;ecurity and in&s;ecurity, or right and wrong.</P>
<P>We are next told, that parliament being the legi&s;lature, its acts mu&s;t bind in all ca&s;es what&s;oever; that no line can be drawn, and there|fore parliament has a con&s;titutional right to impo&s;e taxes.</P>
<P>Before parliament has con&s;titutional powers, it mu&s;t be con&s;titution|ally formed. There is no magic or efficient power in the world which can give it &s;uch a right. Parliament mu&s;t be in part con&s;tituted by the people over whom its laws have &s;way in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, or el&s;e it is not a con&s;titutional power. With re&s;pect to Great Britain, it
<PB N="18" REF="014147_0018_0F93543FA2385488">
is &s;o con&s;tituted; with regard to America, it is not; its power there|fore cannot, or ought not, to be the &s;ame over both countries. The delegation of the people is the &s;ource of that power, mo&s;t e&s;pecially in point of taxation. The delegation is wanting on the part of America, and therefore the right cannot exi&s;t.</P>
<P>It is true that the authority of the legi&s;lature makes laws for the levying money upon the &s;ubject.&mdash;But unle&s;s the gift be previou&s;ly made by the repre&s;entatives of the people, there is nothing on which the act can work. The gift mu&s;t be made fir&s;t and di&s;tinct; the law comes after to pre&s;cribe the mode of levying it. The repre&s;entatives are the &s;ole &s;ource of the gift, the legi&s;lative act is the completion of it; but without a beginning there can be no end. It is therefore a po&s;ition founded in the e&s;&s;ential principles of the con&s;titution, that "the &s;u|preme power, however it may make laws for regulating the &s;tate, can|not take the money of the people without their con&s;ent." [Locke.]</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;idies of the clergy, and a general pardon, will fully illu&s;trate this. The hou&s;es of the legi&s;lature can alter nothing in them, and yet they give their a&s;&s;ent of pa&s;&s;ing them into laws. But the things them|&s;elves on which the laws are founded are eccentric to parliament. They have their motion in another &s;phere. The convocation gives the one; the king of his free grace be&s;tows the other. The parlia|ment cloaths them only with the force of laws, and may chu&s;e in that, when they are prepared to their hands; but with the things them&s;elves it cannot meddle, or originate or modify them.</P>
<P>Any other mode of applying the power of the legi&s;lature to the levying of taxes is not con&s;titutional, but arbitrary. It is confounding the principles of the con&s;titution in the jargon of words, to &s;ay that parliament, becau&s;e it is the &s;upreme power, mu&s;t therefore have a right to impo&s;e taxes upon the people, whether they are repre&s;ented in it or not. Such a parliament would only be a plau&s;ible and powerful in&s;trument of arbitrary power.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this que&s;tion of right by ob&s;erving, that as the power of giving is the great &s;ecurity of our liberties, &s;o it is the only one which the Americans enjoy. Deprived of this, their &s;ituation would be de&s;perate. Expo&s;ed to that jealou&s;y which thou&s;ands are perpetually endeavouring to &s;timulate again&s;t them&mdash;without any power or means, but the ultimate appeal, to counteract or re&s;i&s;t its effects&mdash;they would be at the mercy of every informer, of every governor, mini&s;ter, and member of parliament. Whatever was moved again&s;t them, would meet with no oppo&s;ition; whatever was charged upon them, would be received without que&s;tion or enquiry. They would not only be &s;laves, but the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all &s;laves. In vain would they &s;ay, What is the freedom, what are tho&s;e Briti&s;h privileges to which our charters have told us we are entitled? Where are tho&s;e rights we have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed above an hundred years, which we derived from &s;olemn compact, which we purcha&s;ed by the re&s;traint of our trade, by our acqui&s;itions under tho&s;e re&s;traints emptied into your lap as the great mart of our produce and of our con&s;umptions, by fraternal attachment and un&s;haken alle|giance? The&s;e were the price we paid for your friend&s;hip and your pro|tection: but you would now leave us nothing to pay, nothing to be pro|tected.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="014147_0019_0F935440678C7B30">Upon the whole of this que&s;tion, it &s;eems mo&s;t manife&s;t, that it is the ancient, undoubted right of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, being freemen or freeholders, to give their property by their own con&s;ent only, &s;ignified by them&s;elves or their repre&s;entatives&mdash;That the right of giving money, and the right of making laws, are and ever were &s;eparate and di&s;tinct; the one re&s;iding in the repre&s;entative, the other in the le|gi&s;lative body&mdash;That the Hou&s;e of Commons claim and exerci&s;e the &s;ole and incommunicable right of granting the money of the people of Great-Britain, becau&s;e that hou&s;e alone repre&s;ents them&mdash;That the Hou&s;e of Commons ought not to claim or exerci&s;e &s;uch a right over the people of America, becau&s;e that hou&s;e does not repre&s;ent them&mdash;That to levy taxes upon the people of America, by the authority of the Briti&s;h Parliament, in which they are not repre&s;ented, is uncon&s;titutional; de|prives them of the right of Engli&s;hmen, and reduces them to a &s;tate of ab&s;olute bondage.</P>
<P>From the con&s;ideration of the <HI>right,</HI> we come next to that of the <HI>policy</HI> of rai&s;ing a revenue in America by the Briti&s;h Parliament.</P>
<P>Is it practicable?&mdash;Is it profitable? Upon the&s;e points the policy mu&s;t turn. To rai&s;e a revenue upon a di&s;tant and di&s;per&s;ed people univer&s;ally in oppo&s;ition to it, by an authority, que&s;tionable at lea&s;t upon the &s;ounde&s;t principles of the con&s;titution, and in fact denied&mdash;Is this prac|ticable? "Oh, certainly," &s;ays an advocate for this mode of govern|ment, "have we not a &s;uperior force, have we not fleets and armies to compel their obedience?" Be it &s;o&mdash;But will the revenue pay the expence of this collection? If it will not, how is it to be profitable? One hun|dred thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum</HI> is the utmo&s;t that the mo&s;t extravagant imagination ever expected from the taxation of America. Ten &s;hips and as many regiments have not collected a twentieth part of it: double your force, and &s;uppo&s;e it to collect the whole; your expence will at lea&s;t treble your collection. My &s;uppo&s;itions are extravagantly favour|able to the coercive &s;ide of the que&s;tion, and yet the conclu&s;ion is inevi|tably again&s;t it. Are the&s;e ways and means to an&s;wer the demands of a nation, &s;inking, as it is &s;aid, under its debt and e&s;tabli&s;hment?</P>
<P>But let us give this doctrine of force and coercion its utmo&s;t effect. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that under a conviction of their inability to re&s;i&s;t the whole force of Great-Britain in a time of profound peace, every colony, every a&s;&s;embly, were to acknowledge your right, and promi&s;e implicit obedience, could you tru&s;t this acquie&s;cence? Could any man be &s;o weak as not to perceive, that they were re&s;erving their re&s;i&s;tance, till the time of war and the nece&s;&s;ary avocation of our force &s;hould en&s;ure it &s;ucce&s;s?</P>
<P>Is there any man in his &s;en&s;es, who can &s;eriou&s;ly imagine we &s;hall re|main in peace for five years? Three young monarchs upon the principal thrones of Europe; two old ones looking with hatred and revenge again&s;t us. Is this a &s;tate in which a continuance of peace is to be expected? To give the advocates then for compul&s;ion their utmo&s;t wi&s;h, what is it but to obtain an uncertain advantage for &s;ome years, at the hazard of our ruin or humiliation for ever after? Let any man who has the lea&s;t idea of the difficulties of conducting a war again&s;t the hou&s;e of Bourbon and its allies, inform us, what wi&s;dom, what re&s;ources could &s;ave this

country from ruin, if in the emergency of &s;uch a war our American colonies &s;hould unanimou&s;ly revolt from all obedience, and reject all commerce with us. Who is it that thinks we could &s;urvive &s;uch a &s;troke? And yet this coercive policy is rendering it inevitable as fate.</P>
<P>Of the di&s;po&s;ition of the Americans to re&s;i&s;t our authority, <HI>as of late extended,</HI> which they think utterly unju&s;t; there cannot be a doubt. If they &s;u&s;pend the efforts of that di&s;po&s;ition, it can only be in their wi&s;dom, to watch the mo&s;t favourable moment. That of our being hard pre&s;&s;ed in war is plainly &s;uch. The mo&s;t dangerous conduct, there|fore, for us, would be their acquie&s;cence. Yet we &s;hould certainly &s;ee the ideots who are conducting the&s;e mea&s;ures, triumph upon the receipt of &s;uch accounts from America. Lord North would be held up as the wi&s;e&s;t and the mo&s;t &s;pirited mini&s;ter that ever exi&s;ted, and he would &s;nuff up the incen&s;e of this adulation, in the very &s;incerity of his vanity and &s;olly. But it is neither Lord North nor his &s;lacterers who will &s;tand forth when the &s;torm rages, to &s;hield us from the ruin their want of wi&s;dom and of ju&s;tice will bring upon us.</P>
<P>We have &s;een what would be the probable con&s;equence of an ac|quie&s;cence on the part of America, how dangerous, how fatal to us. Let us take another view of it. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the Americans deter|mined to re&s;i&s;t our attempts to impo&s;e upon them this tribute. It will be incon&s;i&s;tent with our dignity to retract. The wi&s;dom, the ju&s;tice, the utility of per&s;evering&mdash;the&s;e are all out of the que&s;tion. Lord North will have America at his feet. The&s;e are his very words. Who &s;ays Lord North is not a bold &s;peaking mini&s;ter? To gratify him, let us &s;ee if we can compel the Americans to ab&s;olute obedience&mdash;How we can is doubtful&mdash;that we cannot, without ruining our&s;elves, is certain.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, I admire, even to enthu&s;ia&s;m, the bravery of our troops. What men can do, they will do. But in a country furni&s;hed with fa&s;tne&s;&s;es and defiles without number, intimately known to the enemy you are to combat, where di&s;cipline is unavailing or embarra&s;&s;ing, and valour u&s;ele&s;s; it requires more than human power to &s;ucceed to any permanent purpo&s;e. God forbid that the bravery of &s;uch troops as the Engli&s;h, &s;hould be &s;o vainly, &s;o fatally employed. Let us &s;uppo&s;e it true, as &s;ome vain-glorious military men have vaunted, that with four regiments you might march from one end of the continent to the other&mdash;What would the exploit avail you? The moment you quit one province for another, the commotions your pre&s;ence &s;uppre&s;&s;ed will re|vive.</P>
<P>When you have marched through, you will have to march back again. But &s;uch bravados are contemptible. The man who is mo&s;t forward to advi&s;e, is lea&s;t fit to execute &s;uch arduous enterprizes. Nor would the execution an&s;wer any other purpo&s;e, but that of pluming an individual at the expence of his country. They who remember the fatal over|throw of Braddock by a few Indians in ambu&s;h, an overthrow incurred by the very di&s;cipline in which he vainly put his tru&s;t, will be apt to doubt the facility of reducing the colonies by military force. They who reflect, that the united aid and efforts of all the colonies were nece&s;|&s;ary to give &s;ucce&s;s to our arms in the late war again&s;t the Canadians, will be &s;till doubtful of this expedient.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="014147_0021_0F935441D8772348">Difficult however as the reduction of our colonies may be, the pre|&s;erving them in obedience to &s;uch a government would be infinitely more impracticable. But in the mean time, while our troops are em|ployed in &s;laughtering the Americans, who is to cultivate the lands in America? Who is to furni&s;h the gro&s;s materials of our commerce with them? Who is to con&s;ume the manufactures, and maintain the manufacturers to whom that commerce was daily bread? The wi&s;e mi|ni&s;ters who planned the&s;e mea&s;ures have &s;urely provided for this.

<P>The naval &s;tores, the iron, indigo, the tobacco, the flax &s;eed which the labour of the Americans furni&s;h us; are we able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them, or to procure them from other nations? Have we for|got the humiliating terms to which Sweden attempted to reduce us? Our recour&s;e then was to America. She &s;upplied us, and removed that dependence, which would otherwi&s;e have left us at the mercy of foreign nations. When our wi&s;e mea&s;ures have &s;topped up the American channel of &s;upply, what will &s;hield us from the exorbitancy of Sweden and Ru&s;&s;ia? [In 1718 the Ru&s;&s;ians and Swedes agreed not to &s;uffer Great Britain to export any naval &s;tores from their dominions but in Ru&s;&s;ian and Swedi&s;h bottoms, and at their own price. Great Britain was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Pitch and tar ro&s;e to three pounds the barrel. In this emergency, a bounty was offered on tho&s;e articles from the colonies. It &s;uceeded. The&s;e articles &s;ell to fifteen &s;hillings, and we were relieved from tho&s;e exorbi|tant demands; which will, without doubt, be revived when we are fooli&s;h enough to commence ho&s;tilities again&s;t tho&s;e who relieved us.] Naval &s;tores are nece&s;&s;aries; if we re&s;tore the monopoly of them, we mu&s;t take the con&s;equences of our folly. Until South Carolina and Georgia &s;upplied us with indigo, we paid annually to our enemies, the French, 200,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> in &s;pecie, for this article, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;tence of a variety of important manufactures. We offered a bounty upon it. The Americans &s;upplied us not only for our own con&s;umption, but for foreign markets. [See Ander&s;on's Dict. of Commerce] In&s;tead of Specie, they take in return our manufactures, loaded with all our taxes. If the policy which encouraged this commerce was wi&s;e, that which &s;tops it mu&s;t be fooli&s;h.</P>
<P>The duty upon tobacco &s;hould bring into the revenue at lea&s;t 400,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum. By what ways and means will this deficiency be &s;upplied? The profit to this kingdom, upon the confinement of this article alone to the ports of Great Britain, and the returns for it in Briti&s;h manufac|tures and merchandize, amounts, at the lowe&s;t computation, to half a million yearly, exclu&s;ive of the duty. I &s;hall be glad to know how this lo&s;s will be compen&s;ated. I will not enter into the thou&s;and little &s;treams of our American commerce, which all combined form a noble river; that furni&s;hes the navy, the manufactures, the fields of England; and maintains her upon that eminence of grandeur and glory, to which &s;he is exalted. The value of the whole is incomputable. But I &s;hall not think the detail nece&s;&s;ary, till I &s;ee it rendered probable that this extort|ed

<P>Upon the &s;uppo&s;ition then, that in con&s;equence of the mea&s;ures we have lately adopted, unexampled in their rigour, unexampled in the violence and unju&s;tice with which they were conducted, America &s;hould be driven into real re&s;i&s;tence; what will be the con&s;equence? Our commerce, our navy, our revenue, our trade, our manufactures, will receive immediately a dangerous, if not a fatal blow. But we &s;hall be avenged! Our di&s;ciplined troops will put them to the &s;word, and de|&s;troy their plantations; our navy will burn their cities and their trading ve&s;&s;els. Alas! the&s;e would be fatal victories! The&s;e are the men who&s;e labour and indu&s;try furni&s;h the materials of our be&s;t commerce, the &s;upply of who&s;e con&s;umption gives life to our manufactures; the&s;e are plantations, the harve&s;ts of which we ultimately reap: The&s;e are the cities which are the re&s;ervoirs of an infinity of &s;treams of trade, the pro|fits of which are at la&s;t emptied into the lap of Great Britain.

To dimini&s;h, to de&s;troy them; it is mi&s;chief irreparable, it is madne&s;s in the extreme; yet it is the inevitable con&s;equence of the whole &s;y&s;tem of American mea&s;ures, &s;ince the pre&s;ent reign.</P>
<P>We have thus &s;een the probable i&s;&s;ue of ho&s;tile mea&s;ures towards A|merica. If we &s;ucceed, we are ruined. If we do not &s;ucceed&mdash;if by tho&s;e extraordinary exertions which have often proceeded from people contending for their liberties, or by any of tho&s;e accidents which have frequently decided the fate of battles and of empires, taking the victory from the &s;trong, and the race from the &s;wift, we &s;hould be repul&s;ed; to what a &s;tate of humiliation &s;hall we be reduced! Such is the in&s;uperable ab&s;urdity of the mea&s;ure, that, whether victors or vanqui&s;hed, we are &s;ure of being &s;ufferers.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid but a word about the intervention of other powers. Our wi&s;e mini&s;ters will tell us this is improbable. There is not a part of the world upon which France looks with a more attentive eye than upon America. There is not the &s;malle&s;t event, relative to our proceedings towards the colonies of which they are not minutely informed. If they &s;hould be idle &s;pectators of &s;uch a conte&s;t, it would be one of the mo&s;t extraordinary events that ever happened. No folly, le&s;s blind than that which formed the&s;e mea&s;ures again&s;t America, would hazard &s;uch a &s;up|po&s;ition. Whatever pacific appearances a fooli&s;h mini&s;ter may hold out in the King's &s;peech, the French are in fact putting them&s;elves into a po&s;ture which might well make the firme&s;t Engli&s;hman tremble for the event, even if we were perfectly united.</P>
<P>In every view of our proceedings again&s;t America, we &s;ee them un|wi&s;e, perilous, and unprofitable. If pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice have not to|tally taken place of rea&s;on and enquiry, let the planners of this &s;y&s;tem &s;hew us what they rationally expect from it. The mo&s;t confidential men have repeatedly declared, in both hou&s;es of parliament, that a reve|nue is not the object. Lord Mansfield will not deny his declaration at lea&s;t, and there is an ho&s;t in him. [Lord Dartmouth has made the &s;ame declaration this &s;e&s;&s;ion.] In truth whether this was meant in good faith or
<PB N="23" REF="014147_0023_0F9354435BADBD38">
not, it is mo&s;t veritable. No adequate revenue will ever be obtained from forcible means.</P>
<P>To what purpo&s;e then are we hazarding &s;o great a &s;take as the com|merce of this kingdom and the peace of America? Is it that their whig principles are odious at court? Is it that the &s;pirit of the revolution, which animates them, is hateful to every man who has abandoned the once loved cocoa tree, for the now au&s;picious clo&s;et? Is it that a &s;erious &s;y&s;tem of &s;lavery has a&s;cended the back &s;tairs, the fir&s;t line of which is to &s;ubjugate America? One would be very apt to &s;u&s;pect this, had we not the royal a&s;&s;urance that his Maje&s;ty has no intere&s;t, can have no intere&s;t &s;eparate from that of his people. A &s;y&s;tem of &s;lavery can never be the intere&s;t of his people; but a little popery, a little arbitrary power, French law, French religion, French government, and in America only; there can be no harm in that. There is no wind can blow them over to England. And if &s;uch an accident &s;hould happen, there will be ho|ne&s;t men enough found to per&s;uade us there is no harm in that either. A <HI>Fal&s;e Alarm,</HI> or <HI>an An&s;wer to Queries,</HI> will do the bu&s;ine&s;s. One is always happy to &s;ee declarations &s;o well &s;upported by actions; and if it were po&s;&s;ible to doubt the &s;incerity of the royal word, the Quebec bill would make us blu&s;h at our &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>The people are intere&s;ted; it is to them I &s;peak. There is no feel|ing for their intere&s;ts either in the cabinet or in the parliament; their repre&s;entatives &s;acrifice every thing to their own pride and profit: it now only remains with them, as the la&s;t re&s;ource, to in&s;i&s;t on their repre&s;entatives procuring a retraction of tho&s;e fooli&s;h and arbitrary mea&s;ures which have thrown all America into confu&s;ion, and threaten the utter ruin of the mo&s;t valuable commerce we po&s;&s;e&s;s. The taxation of America may pro|vide places and pen&s;ions for the tools and dependants of a mini&s;ter; but it never can relieve our national di&s;tre&s;&s;es, nor even compen&s;ate for the expence of carrying it into execution. The produce of American la|bour is &s;pent in Briti&s;h manufactures; the balance of trade is greatly a|gain&s;t them; whatever you take directly in taxes, is in effect taken from your own commerce. If the mini&s;ter &s;eizes the money with which the American &s;hould pay his debts and come to market, the merchant and the trader cannot expect him as a cu&s;tomer; nor can the debts already contracted be paid. This is cutting up commerce by the roots. It is like the folly of a young man, who takes from the principal of his e&s;tate to &s;upply his wants. We know in this ca&s;e that &s;uch a practice will prove his ruin. The commerce of this kingdom is to the &s;tate, what the principal of his fortune is to a private man. The &s;ame conduct leads to the &s;ame end. Suppo&s;e we obtain from America a million in|&s;tead of an hundred thou&s;and pounds, it would be &s;upplying our pre&s;ent exigencies by the future ruin of our commerce. Nothing can be more obvious. What is it then that can make us per&s;evere in a mea&s;ure, the very &s;ucce&s;s of which mu&s;t be our ruin.</P>
<P>We are told, however, that the Americans pay no taxes, while ours are very heavy; and that as they equally join protection, they ought to contribute their proportion to the expence.</P>
<P>But the que&s;tion is not <HI>whether</HI> the Americans &s;hall contribute, but <HI>how</HI> they &s;hall contribute? Whether they &s;hall be taxed by their own repre&s;entatives or by ours&punc; They contributed during the war, but it was

by their own a&s;&s;emblies; the proof of this is from the records of the Hou&s;e of Commons it&s;elf. The following is a copy of a me&s;&s;age from his Maje&s;ty to the Hou&s;e of Commons, repeated for four &s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>

<P>This was in the good days of George the Second. There was no junto, no back &s;tair bu&s;ine&s;s then; a whig King and a whig Mini&s;ter, &s;peaking to a whig people. A King who did not <HI>profe&s;s</HI> that he had no intere&s;t di&s;tinct from that of his people, but made them read it in his actions. A King who had too much dignity to deceive his people; too much honour to contrive the ruin of their liberties. The &s;y&s;tem then was to <HI>a&s;k</HI> the aid of the people; the &s;y&s;tem now is, to <HI>command</HI> it. The Americans, we &s;ee, contribute then with zeal and vigour; the event will &s;hew whether the new &s;y&s;tem is calculated to inflame their zeal and increa&s;e their ardour. Let us however remember, in the mean time, what credit tho&s;e mini&s;terial tools de&s;erve, who have &s;o confidently affirmed, that the Americans did not contribute to the expences of the late war.</P>

<P>With equal truth it is &s;aid, that the Americans pay no taxes. I will give an e&s;timate of the taxes, both internal and external, paid by the colony of Virginia, with the income and expence of the colony, and the balance will &s;hew their ability to bear additional impo&s;itions.</P>

<P>It appears from this e&s;timate, that a ninth part of the gro&s;s produce of the colony is paid for internal taxes&mdash;that as much is &s;acrificed to the acts of navigation, which re&s;trict their trade to this country for our be|nefit&mdash;that a &s;um, almo&s;t equal to the whole, is expended in Briti&s;h manufactures and merchandize, which leaves the colony in debt, an|nually, 180,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> The va&s;t profits which the Briti&s;h merchants make upon this commerce, enable them to afford that credit; which, when it ri&s;es to an extreme, is reduced by greater frugality in the planter, or by an extraordinary favourable year increa&s;ing the quantity, quality, or price of his produce, and con&s;equently the gro&s;s income of the colony.</P>
<P>The public will judge, from this &s;ituation of one of the riche&s;t colo|nies, of the ability of America to bear additional taxes. Were the right of impo&s;ing them ever &s;o unque&s;tionable, the impropriety of it would be manife&s;t. A young people, loaded with an enormous debt of &s;ix millions, with the balance of trade annually again&s;t them, ari&s;ing entirely from the re&s;trictions we impo&s;e upon their trade, are not fit objects of additional taxation. Were the&s;e circum&s;tances rever&s;ed, there would be &s;ome propriety in applying to them for relief from the load of our national debt and e&s;tabli&s;hment: but as it is, were they ever &s;o little inclined to que&s;tion your right, or to re&s;i&s;t the impo&s;ition of taxes, the con&s;equence of impo&s;ing them would be ruinous. The in|habitants finding it impo&s;&s;ible to live in &s;uch circum&s;tances would retire back in troops, as our own are now emigrating from Great Britain and Ireland. Remote from the &s;ea coa&s;t, they would live entirely within them&s;elves, relinqui&s;hing all commerce with the mother country, and bidding defiance equally to the merchant for his debt, and the crown for its taxes. The&s;e mea&s;ures being prompted by nece&s;&s;ity would be irre&s;i&s;tible. They would leave us a depopulated frontier to tyrannize over; and for this you would have &s;acrificed a valuable and growing commerce, with all the &s;trength and aid which we have received from the active zeal and vigorous efforts of an affectionate, indu&s;trious, loyal people. Were I an enemy to Great Britain, I would promote this very &s;y&s;tem, to humble, to overthrow her. Nothing operates like ne|ce&s;&s;ity. No human wi&s;dom or virtue can produce equal effects. Per|&s;evere in the&s;e mea&s;ures, and you will create that nece&s;&s;ity, which will effect the independence of America beyond the operation of policy or per&s;ua&s;ion. "Men pay too dear for their want of providence; and find too late, that the neglect of ju&s;tice is an infallible undermining, how undi&s;cerned &s;oever, of that &s;ecurity which their policy would ari&s;e
<PB N="26" REF="014147_0026_0F935446A74E4950">
for them&s;elves, in the place of that which wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice had pro|vided for them. [Lord Clarendon.]</P>
<P>How then are we to avert the&s;e evils? How are we to regain the con|fidence of America, and the commerce of Great Britain? Nothing more ea&s;y. Recall your fleets and armies; recall your commi&s;&s;ioners; repeal your u&s;ele&s;s, your obnoxious laws; re&s;tore the e&s;tabli&s;hment of America to what it was at the conclu&s;ion of the late war; cea&s;e to hold out rewards, as if in the Public Gazette, for fraud and impo&s;ition. The Barnards, the Hutchin&s;ons, the Olivers, will without end make &s;uch credulity the ruinous in&s;truments of their revenge, avarice and ambition. Such men never want the &s;pecious pretext of loyalty and order, to cover their intere&s;ted views. [The late re&s;olves of the American Congre&s;s will furni&s;h the faire&s;t ground for reconciliation.]</P>
<P>But it will be &s;aid, that to retract would be to re&s;ign our authority over our colonies. What&mdash;had we no authority over America till the year 1764, when the&s;e mea&s;ures commenced? Was no revenue collected, no acts of parliament obeyed, no &s;upreme power exerci&s;ed or acknow|ledged till the &s;tamp-act? Was that act founded upon any complaint of this kind?</P>
<P>The fact is &s;o far the rever&s;e, that the revenue officers remitted more money home before, than &s;ince that act; the laws of trade were much better obeyed; nor was our &s;upreme controuling power que&s;tioned or oppo&s;ed. If the&s;e po&s;itions are not true, let tho&s;e who advi&s;e the&s;e American mea&s;ures, produce, if they can, any authentic evidence to refute them. I will refer to &s;ome of tho&s;e laws, which, in our &s;ove|reignty, we made for America, and which, in their reluctance to di&s;|pute with us, they obeyed. In the re&s;triction of their trade and manu|factures, the exerci&s;e of our power was wantonly oppre&s;&s;ive; yet until we pa&s;&s;ed that line, and attempted to take their money from them with|out their con&s;ent, that is, to make them the mo&s;t abject &s;laves, we hear of no petitions, remon&s;trances, and a&s;&s;ociations again&s;t our acts. The &s;entiments of America, upon this que&s;tion, are exactly &s;imilar, and ought to be equally re&s;pected with tho&s;e of our ance&s;tors in the ca&s;e of &s;hip-money. I will give them in the words of Mr. Hume. "The amount of the whole tax was very moderate, little exceeding twenty thou&s;and pounds&mdash;It was di&s;tributed upon the people with ju&s;tice and equality, and the money, honour, and advantage of the kingdom; yet all the&s;e circum&s;tances could not reconcile the people to the impo&s;ition. It was entirely arbitrary. By the &s;ame right any other tax might be impo&s;ed, and men e&s;teemed a powerful fleet, though very de&s;irable, but a poor recompence for all their liberties." Hi&s;t. of Eng. V. v. p. 210. In proof of what I have &s;aid, I will recite &s;ome of the mo&s;t grievous exer|tions of our &s;upreme authority to which they &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The prohibition from making &s;teel, or erecting &s;teel furnaces, This was the more &s;evere, as it &s;acrificed all America to five or &s;ix per|&s;ons in England, engaged in this manufacture, who are &s;o far from being able to &s;upply the market, that con&s;iderable quantities are yearly im|ported from Germany.</P>
<P>Secondly, Obliging them to land the Spani&s;h and Portugal wines and fruit, which they import, in England, &s;ubject to high duties and heavy
<PB N="27" REF="014147_0027_0F9354478D8D8F08">
charges for re-&s;hipping. This re&s;triction not only grievou&s;ly enhances the price of the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary articles, but expo&s;es their ve&s;&s;els to the danger and expence of an additional voyage of one thou&s;and miles, in a boi&s;ter|ous &s;ea, in time of peace; and in time of war, to an advanced in&s;urance of 25 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, The re&s;traint laid on the &s;ale of hats, and the prohibition of exporting them. In con&s;equence of this, an inhabitant of one pro|vince cannot buy a hat from his neighbour, being a hatter, in the other; but mu&s;t &s;end 3000 miles for it, at three times the price, for the benefit of our manufactures. Is this no &s;acrifice on the part of America? No advantage to ours?</P>
<P>Fourthly, They are not &s;uffered to erect plating or &s;liting mills, or tilt hammers. Thus, though iron is the produce of their own country, they mu&s;t &s;end it to England, and pay us for manufacturing it, before they are &s;uffered to avail them&s;elves of tho&s;e advantages which God has given them. Nails, hoes, ploughs, axes, &amp;c. they are under the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing, from the nature of their country, in great quantities; yet they are obliged to take &s;uch as we plea&s;e to give them, at our own price, loaded with our taxes, and the charges of double freight, com|mi&s;&s;ions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fifthly, They are prohibited from carrying wool, or any kind of woolen goods made in one colony, to another. A &s;ingle fleece of wool, or a dozen of home-made ho&s;e carried from one colony to another, is not only forfeited, but &s;ubjects the ve&s;&s;el if conveyed by water, or the waggon and hor&s;es, if by land, to a &s;eizure, and the owner to a heavy fine.</P>
<P>Sixthly, The Americans are not permitted to carry logwood to any foreign market, without previou&s;ly bringing it to &s;ome Briti&s;h port, to land, and re-&s;hip it, at the great ri&s;que, expence, and lo&s;s of time.</P>
<P>I will not trouble the reader with more in&s;tances, though they are many. The&s;e are amply &s;ufficient to &s;hew what authority we had over them, and how rigorou&s;ly we exerci&s;ed it&mdash;how much to our own ad|vantage, and to their lo&s;s. When we have de&s;troyed the Americans, or di&s;&s;olved by our inju&s;tice and extortion their connection with us, where is it we &s;hall find another people whom we may thus make the in&s;tru|ments of our manufactures and commerce? Where is it we can &s;ecure a monopoly of the gro&s;s article, and of its con&s;umption when manufactur|ed? It is plain from the&s;e very re&s;trictions, that America is capable of manufacturing for her&s;elf. There is no doubt but that a little time would enable her to &s;upply other nations.</P>
<P>The de&s;i&s;ting from this, confining them&s;elves to the culture of raw materials, and con&s;uming our manufactures loaded with every charge, tax, and impo&s;ition, is the price we paid for the protection we gave them. We exacted it rigorou&s;ly, yet they paid it willingly. Severe as the re&s;traints were, they flouri&s;hed under them, and therefore did not complain. But when we a&s;&s;umed a greater power; when, not content with re&s;training their acqui&s;itions, we began to take from them at our plea&s;ure, what they acquired under tho&s;e re&s;traints; this was a &s;y&s;tem of &s;uch glaring inju&s;tice, that they could not &s;ubmit to it. It was a &s;y&s;tem that left them nothing they could call their own. What incite|ment
<PB N="28" REF="014147_0028_0F935449884CB1E0">
could any man in America have to be indu&s;trious or acquire property, when a Hou&s;e of Commons, di&s;tant, unknown to him, uncon|nected with him, unelected by him, not &s;haring in the tax they impo&s;ed, or rather &s;aving their own, as they lavi&s;hed his property, might di&s;po&s;e of it as they plea&s;ed, without his con&s;ent or participation, or tho&s;e of any one deputed by him?</P>
<P>Nor were we content with this; we &s;ubjected all their property to the judgment of a &s;ingle judge of admiralty, without the intervention of a jury. A judge appointed by the King, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting at his plea&s;ure, yet determining between the King and the &s;ubject, and payable out of the forfeitures which his judgment again&s;t the &s;ubject &s;hould produce. It is not in human wickedne&s;s and ju&s;tice to devi&s;e more infallible means of perverting ju&s;tice, and rendering property in&s;ecure. And that this mo&s;t arbitrary mea&s;ure might be executed in the mo&s;t odious man|ner, tho&s;e men were appointed to the&s;e offices who had &s;ignalized them|&s;elves, not by their abilities and virtue, but by being infamous &s;ticklers again&s;t their country. Let us contemplate for a moment the effect of this e&s;tabli&s;hment of vice-admiralty courts. The law gives the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer the option of carrying his &s;eizure into any one of the four courts appointed for all America. The officer makes his &s;eizure in Pen&s;acola, and libels in the court at Hallifax, which is more than two thou&s;and miles di&s;tant. The owner mu&s;t be at the expence of going thither, mu&s;t &s;ubmit his property to the arbitration of &s;uch a judge, and whether the deci&s;ion be for or again&s;t him, he can have no retribution for his expences, or for the delay, or for the damage his cargo may have received. The law has made the judge's certificate a protection to the officer again&s;t an action of damages.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed, however, that the oppre&s;&s;ion of America was not &s;et &s;uffi|ciently &s;evere. All their judges were therefore rendered dependent upon the crown for their &s;alaries and their places. The lives and liber|ties as well as the property of the people were to be at the mercy of the crown. To make the &s;y&s;tem complete, their governors were rendered as ab&s;olute as the Spani&s;h Viceroys. In fine, to convince them that they were doomed to experience the la&s;t exertion of arbitrary power, a military force was &s;ent to execute this &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e injuries and in&s;ults, we are &s;urprized that the Americans &s;hould be di&s;contented! We think it extraordinary that they &s;hould de|&s;troy the tea &s;ent on purpo&s;e to compel the payment of a duty &s;o impo&s;|ed! It is an injury to private property: but who offered the fir&s;t injury to private property? Who was it that claimed and exerci&s;ed a right to di&s;po&s;e of all the property in America at their plea&s;ure? The Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons. A &s;et of men a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, who have ju&s;t as much right to di&s;po&s;e of property in America as the Divan at Con&s;tantinople has in England. This was the fir&s;t interruption of that harmony which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two countries; a harmony under which the commerce and manufactures of this country &s;o eminently pro&s;pered. The Americans were not the aggre&s;&s;ors. They received the news of the intended &s;tamp-act with a&s;toni&s;hment. It was &s;ome time before they could believe it po&s;&s;ible, that a parliament which they re|garded with re&s;pect could be guilty of &s;uch an outrage again&s;t their
<PB N="29" REF="014147_0029_0F93544A17B4A638">
rights: That a Hou&s;e of Commons, who exi&s;ted only by the election of the people of England, who would not &s;uffer any other branch of the legi&s;lature to touch the property of the people, becau&s;e they only are deputed by them, &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly re&s;olve that it might be ju&s;t and ex|pedient for them to give and grant the property of the people of Ame|rica. One reads, to this moment, &s;uch a re&s;olution with a mixture of a&s;toni&s;hment and ridicule. Had they re&s;olved that it would be ju&s;t and proper for that Hou&s;e to turn all the white people in America into blacks, it would not have been more ridiculous. For God's &s;ake whence did they derive the right of giving the property of the people of Ame|rica? Did that people ever delegate to them &s;uch a right? Can &s;uch a right exi&s;t without the delegation of the community to whom the pro|perty belongs? Yet from this ab&s;urd re&s;olution we proceeded to acts which have alienated and inflamed all America. Are the Americans to blame for all this? Are they culpable for the con&s;equences? Are we to put fire in a man's hand and puni&s;h him for expre&s;&s;ing a &s;en&s;e of pain and endeavour to reject it? Are the Americans dive&s;ted of the feelings of humanity? If they are not, the things which are calculated to rouze and irritate tho&s;e feelings, mu&s;t have their effects.</P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances, the tea was de&s;troyed at Bo&s;ton by per&s;ons unknown. Without enquiring after the guilty, without evidence, with|out a hearing, (their agent refu&s;ed a hearing, upon a quibble which would have di&s;graced the Old Baily) we proceed to puni&s;h the town of Bo&s;ton, to a thou&s;and times the amount of the damage &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>But this was not enough; in violation of the royal faith, we alter their charter, without any act of forfeiture even pretended. Their juries, who were cho&s;en by lot, and therefore, as far as human precaution could effect, were rendered impartial, we have directed to be returned by the &s;heriff, who is a creature of the governor's appointment; and thus a way is found out to have the lives, liberties, and property of the people at the mercy of the crown, under the form of law, by pack'd juries, as well as dependent judges. The&s;e are the mea&s;ures which are to calm the commotions of America, and re&s;tore the harmony we have interrupted. Yet after all the&s;e proceedings, calculated to exa&s;perate and inflame the Americans, and to convince them that we have neither ju&s;tice nor wi&s;dom to guide us, the men who have been in&s;trumental in all this are gravely told, that the "temper and firmne&s;s with which they have acted, will en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s"&mdash;and that a bill for e&s;tabli&s;hing popery and arbitrary government in America "is founded upon the cleare&s;t principles of humanity and ju&s;tice." On any other occa&s;ion one would have been tempted to think this was &s;aid to ridicule them. Let it have been meant as it will, &s;uch prai&s;e is the &s;evere&s;t &s;atire.</P>
<P>Spirit of the Stuarts, look down and wonder! This &s;ingle tran&s;action will put all your merits to the blu&s;h!</P>
<P>Every &s;tep we have taken re&s;pecting America, for ten years pa&s;t, has been repugnant to the practice of our ance&s;tors. It was their policy to conciliate the people, and &s;ecure their commerce to Great Britain. Our &s;y&s;tem has been to alienate and irritate them. We have made it a pub|lic virtue in America to di&s;continue all commerce with us, and to en|courage &s;muggling. We &s;hall attempt, perhaps too late, to return to
<PB N="30" REF="014147_0030_0F93544D2FB1D2D8">
the wi&s;dom of former times. If there were any defects in the American con&s;titutions, we have not taken the proper &s;teps to rectify them. "Time only, and long experience" &s;ays Sully, "can bring remedies to the defects in a &s;tate who&s;e form is already determined; and this ought always to be attempted, with a view to the plan of its original con&s;titution: this is &s;o certain, that whenever we &s;ee a &s;tate conducted by mea&s;ures contrary to tho&s;e made u&s;e of in its foundation, we may be a&s;&s;ured a great revolution is at hand." [Memoirs, v. 2.]</P>
<P>The American con&s;titutions were modelled upon that of England. We have begun the reformation: but the taxing the people without their being repre&s;ented&mdash;the depriving them of all influence in the go|vernment&mdash;the abolition of juries in part, and rendering the re&s;t liable to be pack'd by the crown officers&mdash;the making their judges dependent, and their governors ab&s;olute&mdash;the impowering cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, at their plea&s;ure, to break open a man's doors, cabinets, che&s;ts, &amp;c. ren|dering his hou&s;e no longer his ca&s;tle of protection&mdash;the&s;e are the refor|mations we have attempted in America. They are indeed with a view to the original con&s;titution, but manife&s;tly with a view to overturn it. The event will &s;hew whether Sully's con&s;equence will follow, whether a great revolution will en&s;ue. In my judgment it will be inevitable, unle&s;s the intervention of the people at large, who in every view are in|tere&s;ted to prevent it, &s;hould exert the&s;e powers which they have in the &s;tate, and prevail on parliament to retract all tho&s;e obnoxious, uncon|&s;titutional mea&s;ures, and re&s;tore America to that &s;tate in which they were at the end of the war. Our commerce with her then was uninterrupted, properous and profitable; our authority over her was fully &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve this advantage. By arrogating more, we endanger the lo&s;s of the whole, either by the de&s;truction or di&s;connection of the people upon whom it depended.</P>
<P>That our authority over America, and the advantages we derived from her, before the&s;e mea&s;ures commenced, were as great as in rea&s;on and ju&s;tice we &s;hould require, is the opinion of a wi&s;e and well informed foreigner; a writer who has viewed the &s;tate of all the European colo|nies with great impartiality and attention; I mean the celebrated author of the <HI>Hi&s;toire philo&s;ophique des Indes.</HI> His &s;entiments are the&s;e:</P>
<P>"Great Britain enjoys all the power, over her colonies that &s;he ought to de&s;ire. She has a negative on all the laws they make. The execu|tive power is entirely in the hands of her delegates. There is an appeal to her from all their civil courts. All their commercial movements are in her arbitration. To increa&s;e the yoke of a domination &s;o wi&s;ely framed, would be to plunge the continent anew into that di&s;order from which they have hardly extricated them&s;elves by two centuries of con|tinual labour and hard&s;hips&mdash;it would be to compel the indu&s;trious la|bourers, who have cleared it, to arm in defence of tho&s;e &s;acred rights which they hold equally from nature and &s;ociety. The people of Eng|land, a people &s;o devoted to liberty, who have &s;ometimes protected it in regions unallied to them&mdash;can they forget tho&s;e principles which their glory, their virtue, their feelings, their &s;afety, render an eternal duty? Will they betray tho&s;e rights, which are &s;o dear to them&s;elves, &s;o far as to contribute to reduce their brothers to &s;lavery? If however it &s;hould
<PB N="31" REF="014147_0031_0F93544F30817718">
happen, that &s;ome incendiary &s;pirits &s;hould devi&s;e &s;o fatal a mea&s;ure, and in &s;ome moments of madne&s;s &s;hould have it adopted by Great-Bri|tain, what ought then to be the conduct of the colonies, to prevent their falling under the mo&s;t odious &s;ervitude?</P>
<P>"Before they proceed to extremities, they &s;hould remember all the advantages they derive from the more powerful &s;tate. England has al|ways been a bulwark to them, again&s;t the nations of Europe. She has been a guide to them, and a pre&s;erver of tho&s;e civil di&s;&s;entions, which jealou&s;y and rival&s;hip but too often excite among neighbouring &s;tates, in their infancy and progre&s;s. It is to the influence of her excellent con|&s;titution that they owe the pro&s;perity they enjoy. As long as the colonies continue under wi&s;e and moderate regulation, they will continue to ex|tend the progre&s;s of their indu&s;try to the farther extremity of their coun|try.</P>
<P>"But may their love for Great Britain be, in the mean time, ac|companied by a certain jealou&s;y of their liberties. Let their rights be frequently examined, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and explained. Let them cheri&s;h tho&s;e as their be&s;t citizens, who ince&s;&s;antly warm them. This jealous &s;pi|rit is nece&s;&s;ary in all free &s;tates; but more e&s;pecially in a mixed con|&s;titution, where liberty is joined with a certain dependence nece&s;&s;ary to the connection between two di&s;tant &s;tates. Such vigilance will be the &s;ure&s;t guardian of that union, which ought for ever to connect Great Britain and her American colonies.</P>
<P>"But if the mini&s;try, which always, even in free &s;tates, con&s;i&s;ts of ambitious men, &s;hould attempt to augment the power of the crown, or the revenue of the &s;tate, to the injury of the colonies, they ought firmly to re&s;i&s;t the u&s;urpation&mdash;Yet they are too much enlightened not to know, that they cannot be ju&s;tified in proceeding to extre|mities, till they have tried every means of obtaining redre&s;s in vain: [The Americans have in fact exhau&s;ted every peaceable means of ob|taining redre&s;s. for &s;even years they have ince&s;&s;antly complained and petitioned for redre&s;s; their return has invariably been a repetition of injuries, aggravated by the mo&s;t intolerable in&s;ults. There has not been a &s;ingle in&s;tance in which they have complained, without being rebuked, or in which they have been complained again&s;t, without be|ing puni&s;hed.] but they know too, that if they are driven to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of chu&s;ing &s;lavery or war, if they are compelled to take up arms in defence of their liberty, they ought not to &s;ully &s;o noble a cau&s;e with all the horrors and cruelties of &s;edition; and with the determined pur|po&s;e of not &s;heathing the &s;word, till their rights are vindicated, they &s;hould be &s;atisfied with the recovery of their former privileges."</P>
<P>Prejudice and imaginary intere&s;t, artfully laid before us, have made us view the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s through a fal&s;e medium. But this phi|lo&s;opher, who &s;ees the whole with an equal and impartial eye, who&s;e ex|amination of the &s;tate of our connection with America has made him a competent, and his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s an upright judge, can clearly per|ceive the unwi&s;e and unju&s;t policy of our proceedings. The univer&s;al di&s;content of America, where no temper was ever heard of before the commencement of the&s;e mea&s;ures, ought to convince us that they labour under real grievances. It is an infalliable truth, what the Duke de Sul|ly
<PB N="32" REF="014147_0032_0F93544F9C2EB8C0">
has ob&s;erved&mdash;<HI>Pour le peuple, ce n'e&s;t jamais par envie d'attaquer, qu'elle &s;e &s;ouleve; mais par impatience de &s;ouffrir.</HI> [V. I. 133.] "The people never ri&s;e from a de&s;ire of doing, but from an impatience of &s;uf|fering injuries." But only that love of tranquility, which with-holds people in general from commotions, operated with the Americans, but the additional motives of affection and re&s;pect, which made them always regard this country as their home. The&s;e were habits ari&s;ing from education, which always take the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the human mind. Nothing indeed could have overcome the re&s;traint of the&s;e feel|ings, but &s;o palpable an inva&s;ion of their rights and liberties, as con|vinced them there was a de&s;ign in his Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters to en&s;lave them. As the true de&s;cendants of Engli&s;hmen, they are jealous of their liberty, and prize it beyond all earthly ble&s;&s;ings. It is a &s;pirit we ought to re|&s;pect, even in its exce&s;&s;es, becau&s;e there is always more danger of &s;inking into &s;lavery, than of ri&s;ing into licentiou&s;ne&s;s. When we cen&s;ure the &s;truggles of other people for their liberties, I am afraid we &s;hall not long contend for our own.</P>
<P>No man, &s;ays the gallant lord Mole&s;worth, can be a &s;incere lover of liberty, who is not for encrea&s;ing and communicating that ble&s;&s;ing to all people: and therefore the giving or re&s;toring it, not only to our brethren of Scotland and Ireland, but even to France it&s;elf, were it in our power, is one of the principal articles of whiggi&s;m.</P>
<P>May the liberties of England be immortal&mdash;but may Engli&s;hmen ever remember, that the &s;ame arbitrary &s;pirit which prompts an inva&s;ion of the con&s;titution in America, will not long leave that of England unat|tacked; and that the &s;ame corrupt &s;ervility in their members, will make them the in&s;truments of the crown in all its attempts.</P>
