<P>IN the beginning of this year there came a <HI>Dove</HI> flying about, made in the form of an <HI>Almanack,</HI> and &s;ent (under pretence) from <HI>Noah,</HI> to &s;ee if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; which taking in my hand and &s;earching her body, I found her to be rather a <HI>Raven</HI> than a <HI>Dove,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he had under the Dove-feathers a very black skin; whereupon the old News was writen, <HI>&s;ent forth to bring Chri&s;tian-people from their freedom in Chri&s;t back again under Bondage of the terrible Law.</HI> He the work man of this Dove <HI>I. A. S.</HI> hath taken, it &s;eems, his advantage and opportunity of the Circum&s;tances and Conditions of this Country, wherein, as in a Wilderne&s;s, mo&s;t part of the Inhabitants being &s;imple and ignorant, are &s;oon per&s;waded this way or that, for want of true and faithful Guiders and Teachers, as well as nece&s;&s;ary Books, e&s;pecially in this his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>His excu&s;e, p. 2. <HI>That he under taketh not to be po&s;itive in any thing,</HI> will not clear him; for is he not po&s;itive? how then cometh it, that he him&s;elf not only doth keep the <HI>Jewi&s;h Sabbath,</HI> but by Di&s;|cour&s;es, and countenancing that party, yea, publick Writings troubleth, as much as in him is, others with the &s;ame?

<P>Con&s;idering the&s;e things, and the ill con&s;equence that would follow, I could not in Con&s;cience keep &s;ilent and let this Coun|terfeit Dove pa&s;s my door, but by the Grace <HI>of that Holy Dove in Chri&s;ts Bapti&s;m,</HI> re&s;olved to &s;end her home again with an Olive Leaf in her mouth, for a to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n that the Waters are long ago ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted from off the Earth.

<P><HI>By thy glorious Re&s;urrection, good Lord, deliver us, Amen.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 1. The plaine&s;t way for me to go to work in this matter. I have thought, as I do &s;till think, will be to examine the Author of the Almanack according to his own method propo&s;ed in Ob&s;er|vations, to the end, that by all <HI>I</HI> may the better be under&s;tood, and his Ob&s;ervations (conferred with my Remarks) may give more light to the Reader. And becau&s;e the chiefe&s;t &s;cope of his matter he aimeth at, is to bring in the <HI>Jews Sabbath,</HI> therefore I will pa&s;s by &s;ome of his fir&s;t Ob&s;ervations, for fear I &s;hould be too large; But before my coming to the very matter, I cannot but con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s that there is &s;omething &s;trangely &s;et down, as in his Ob&s;ervation 11. there it &s;eems to me as if <HI>Time</HI> were that Choas where|of the World in created; I think &s;uch an Axiom is again&s;t not
<PB N="3" REF="001165_0005_0FB0964A6637B8D0">only the Chiefe&s;t Philo&s;ephers, who &s;ay that <HI>Time</HI> and Place were not before the World was created, but al&s;o again&s;t Gods Word. becau&s;e <HI>Time</HI> could not be before things were created, much le&s;s the very e&s;&s;ential nature of every thing.</P>
<P>What &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Time(if we may improperly &s;o term it) there was and &s;hall be in the Eternity, we hope to &s;ee, but we do not yet know; but to make <HI>Time</HI> more ancient then the world, is to plead for the God-head of Time, in the &s;ame manner as St. <HI>John</HI> did for our Saviour in the fir&s;t <HI>Chap.</HI> of his Go&s;pel, for what&s;oever was in the beginning, was before the beginning, and what was before, was Eternal, and God him&s;elf. To make the Time co-equal with the World, but wholly of a different nature from what God made the whole World of, is non-&s;en&s;e. No Philo&s;epher hath yet di&s;owned Time to be an Accident, and con&s;equently as the Modification of the Sub&s;tance, in&s;eperably inherent in it.</P>
<P>Hence can but from all the&s;e his a&s;&s;ertions (which I leave as not worthy any an&s;wer) conclude, that the author hath a mind to make the <HI>Jewi&s;h &s;eventh day</HI> of &s;uch a natural Holine&s;s, that the very Time, as the &s;ub&s;tance, and the Holine&s;s as a natural perfe|ction &amp; in&s;eparable accident, are concomitant, &amp; never to be &s;epera|ted, <HI>&s;pectatum admi&s;&s;i re&s;umteneat is amics.</HI> A new Logick Canon inded! never heard of before. Why may I not as well argue, The Cloth adorning our bodies is the &s;ub&s;tance, the whit Colour is its natural perfection and in&s;eparable accident, <HI>Ergo</HI> none mu&s;t wear other colour be&s;ides White; or if you will have a &s;acred in&s;tance, the Covenant between God and the earth, <HI>Never to be de&s;troyed by Water,</HI> Gen. 9 13. <HI>&s;eq.</HI> is the nature or &s;ub&s;tance of the <HI>Rain-bow.</HI> All what the <HI>Sabbatharians</HI> can reply &amp; the be&s;t argument they can have, is, That the fourth Commandment is a <HI>moral Law, and therefore per|petual.</HI> To give a &s;hort an&s;wer to it, I &s;ay, that we mu&s;t needs make a di&s;tinction between <HI>a natural or &s;imply moral Law,</HI> and <HI>a po&s;itive moral Law.</HI></P>
<P>Natural moral Law is of it &s;elf in the nature without any po&s;itive Law, or external Con&s;titution, and therefore imprinted in mens hearts at the very Creation, is univer&s;al to all per&s;ons, and their perpetual obligation.</P>
<P>Put po&s;itive moral Laws are not imprinted in the heart, neither by Nature or Grace, are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Univer&s;al; oblige only People or Nations upon which they are unpo&s;ed by the Law-giver, and &s;o
<PB N="4" REF="001165_0006_0FB0964BEF5CFC18">may be di&s;pen&s;ed withall. Which a great Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> Dr. <HI>Fr. White,</HI> in his book, called, <HI>A Treati&s;e of the Sabbath-day, again&s;t Sabbatharian-novelty,</HI> in this matter very plainly doth declare more at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arge. Let now the <HI>Sabbatharians</HI> remon&s;trate, that the fourth Com|mandment concerning the very time of the day is properly, natu|rally, &s;imply and perpetually Moral, and that it is equal in that cir|cum&s;tance to the re&s;t in that Commandment and the other nine; which before they can, let them not pre&s;ume &s;o ra&s;hly to affirm, that the &s;ame is the part, jot or tittle of that eternal Law, which Chri&s;t commanded to be ob&s;erved in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Church</HI> to the worlds end, <HI>Math</HI> 5.19.</P>
<P>To wor&s;hip a God is a <HI>natural moral Law, and &V;niver&s;al,</HI> but ju&s;t upon &s;uch or &s;uch a day is never <HI>natural moral, nether &V;niver&s;al,</HI> el&s;e &s;hould the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> agree in it, which we know to the contrary.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Edward Stillingfleet</HI> in his <HI>Orig. Sacr. B</HI> 11. <HI>ch.</HI> 7. <HI>&s;ect</HI> 2. <HI>&s;eqq.</HI> hath a notable di&s;cour&s;e about &s;uch Law, where he &s;heweth how the Ceremonial Precepts (making mention among the re&s;t, of di&s;tinction of days) do not in them&s;elves imply an immutable Ob|ligation, becau&s;e they are not required of God upon their own ac|count, but in order to &s;ome further end, which as &s;oon as it is come, the Obligation cea&s;eth; as for example, <HI>Prayer Invocation,</HI> and &s;uch like are required of God upon their own account, and there|fore carry an indi&s;pen&s;ible Obligation in them to their performance; but as Circumci&s;ion, di&s;tinction of Meats and Days, which are only good becau&s;e God commands them; They are <HI>meerly Po&s;itive,</HI> who&s;e worth and value ari&s;eth not from the intrin&s;ick weight of the things, but from the external impre&s;s of divine Authority upon them, as the inqui&s;itive Reader may &s;ee it more at large in that Book of the learne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> man mentioned, whereupon I &s;hall draw nearer to the Authors Ob&s;ervations beginning at his <HI>11th Ob&s;ervation.</HI></P>

As for the Tran&s;lation, &s;ome expre&s;&s;ing the &s;en&s;e and meaning of it, renders it <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> which is not a gue&s;s or incertainty, much le&s;s a &s;trange <HI>Idoli&s;m,</HI> as the Author &s;aith, committed ot them, who well under&s;tood the property of the <HI>Hebr.</HI> Tongue, and the natural &s;en&s;e of it, nay, many of them could &s;peak and write the Original Tongues (as all their time therein &s;pending) as well as they under&s;tood their own, yes, far better than many now, who pretend to read it in the book, and under&s;tand but a little part, or &s;ome few words of it, and ought therefore not boa&s;t of any &s;pecial knowledge thereof, to degrade them old great Lights of the World, who&s;e Di&s;ciples and Schollars we are.

But the Author goeth on, to &s;hew his wit further in the following, <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> 13 and 14. which for &s;hortne&s;s &s;ake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n both at once be an&s;wered to.</P>

<P>Neither can it be proved that the fir&s;t day of &s;abbaths is &s;o ap|pointed of God to be accounted in the re&s;pect of the <HI>50th</HI> day, but in re&s;pect to every week of them &s;even; in &s;hort, as &s;oon as one time &s;even was pa&s;t, they &s;hould begin again another, till they have nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">bred &s;even times &s;even, and then &s;hould that <HI>50th</HI> day be numbred, <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> 13.16. therefore is that Fea&s;t called not a Fea&s;t of Days, but of Weeks, <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> 15.9, 10.

<P>But let this be how it will, we know and are a&s;&s;ured that the year when Chri&s;t was crucified and ro&s;e from the dead, this date tell upon the fir&s;t day of the week, and al&s;o the Holy Gho&s;t coming down, which through Gods providence was in all probability, yea, certainty, for the &s;anctifying of the Fir&s;t Day.</P>

<P>Now what Man in the World is there (if he had but one eye, or was quite blind, and only heard this read) that could not &s;ee and feel (what this Author cannot &s;ee with his two Eyes) that the <HI>Scots</HI> did keep that <HI>Lords Day,</HI> called, <HI>Sunday,</HI> and in keeping of it made no mi&s;take or &s;cruple, as <HI>Baxter</HI> before in this his pa&s;&s;age &s;heweth, but Only that they could not tell upon which <HI>Sunday</HI> that anniver&s;ary Lords Day <HI>(Ea&s;ter)</HI> rightly &s;hould fall in, and that for want of Intelligence from other Churches, as <HI>Baxter</HI> a little before doth affirm.</P>

Surely nay. And of as little con&s;equence is his proof for his A&s;&s;ertion of the Lords Day only once in the year; by People &s;tanding in Prayer, &amp;c. becau&s;e &s;uch was not only done that day, but every &s;uch Day until Pentico&s;t. <HI>Tertullian</HI> is plain in his <HI>Corona M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lit. c.</HI> 3. <Q>We do not keep fa&s;ting, neither upon our knees praying, and this li|berty we do enjoy from Ea&s;ter to the Pentico&s;t.</Q></P>

His <HI>6th Argument</HI> is a weak one, becau&s;e Chri&s;t knowing very well the time of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>'s de&s;truction, and how within that time &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;h't old Polity, as the Judaical was, could not &s;o &s;oon, as to all its circum&s;tances, be abrogated, but by little and little decay, he exhorts his Di&s;ciples (who, after his Re&s;urrection, &s;hould oft have occa&s;ion to meet with the <HI>Jews</HI> upon this their Sabbath) to pray that they might enjoy the &s;ame with them, for their edification among them. The <HI>2d Rea&s;on</HI> is this, That not only many believing <HI>Jews</HI> adhered &s;tifly to many legal Ob&s;ervations, &amp;c e&s;pecially to the Law of the Sabbath, but the unbelieving <HI>Jews</HI> were mo&s;t rigid and zealous Ob&s;ervers of their Elders Traditions, e&s;teeming it an intollerable Prophanation to travel, labour or flee, or to do &s;uch like upon their Sabbath Day. Now, if the Di&s;ciples or Chri&s;tian Believers &s;hould have been compelled to flee on the Sabbath Day (which was no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, e&s;pecially becau&s;e that Law concerning the Sabbath day, as well as other ceremonial Laws, cea&s;ed at the de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem)</HI> they would have been in danger to be grievou&s;ly mole&s;ted and per&s;ecuted by their own &s;uper&s;titious Nation, (&s;ee Dr. <HI>Fr. White's Treati&s;e of the Sabbath Day.</HI>) And I que&s;tion not but that Chri&s;t (<HI>Mat.</HI> 24.20.) did under&s;tand the Sabbath of <HI>Ea&s;ter-Time</HI> (called by St. <HI>John,</HI> an high or great Sabbath-Day, cap. 19.31.) for as Hi&s;tory tells us, the City was be&s;ieged at the time when many thou&s;ands of People from afar off were gathered thither to celebrate <HI>Easter</HI> (from which its plain, that forty years after Chri&s;ts Re&s;urrection that ceremony was not left off; which contradicts <HI>I. A. S's</HI> a&s;&s;ertion, <HI>That all Cere|monies were then done away)</HI> being his exhortation, not only to his Di&s;ciples, who were pre&s;ent, but by them, to all lovers of Chri&s;t, that they might e&s;cape that great Calamity, and I cannot but be per&s;waded, that many, by their Prayers, did obtain it (<HI>James</HI> 5.16) &s;aving them&s;elves by flight to another little Town called <HI>Pella.</HI> In &s;hort, Chri&s;t under&s;tood the Sabbath-Day and Winter to be times very inconvenient, trouble&s;om, dangerous and difficult to travel in or flee away.</P>
<P>His <HI>7th Argument</HI> is weaker, becau&s;e how could the Women (<HI>Luke</HI> 23.56) do otherwi&s;e, Chri&s;t being that Sabbath, yet in the Sepul|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her? and &s;o by the holy Gho&s;t commended for nothing more than what th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> due was that time.</P>

<P>His <HI>9th Argument</HI> is the weake&s;t of all, becau&s;e what he talketh there of them in the Old Te&s;tament, was no more than what they were bound to do that time. Chri&s;t, during the time of Hu|miliation, ob&s;erved duly not only the Sabbath of the 4th Com|mandment, but all other legal Rites and Ob&s;ervances, becau&s;e he was then under the Law, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.4. from whence you will wrongly &s;o conclude, That becau&s;e Chri&s;t ob&s;erved the other Laws, as well as the Sabbath, &s;o long as he was under the Law, therefore we mu&s;t ob&s;erve all tho&s;e Laws and the Sabbath too. But on the other hand, may we not rather argue thus. That becau&s;e after the time of Humiliation Chri&s;t never u&s;ed the Saturday Sabbath (&s;ee &sect;. 7.) or any other legal Rites, &s;o neither are we to ob&s;erve them. As to what he &s;peaketh about the Apo&s;tles, every one that that hath common Rea&s;on, and will not abu&s;e it, mu&s;t under&s;tand, that it was at the beginning of the Churches &s;ettling, when the Apo&s;tles could not get better opportunity to in&s;truct them in the Chri&s;tian Faith (but by little and little to teach them concerning the Ce&s;la|tion of the old Law) than to be pre&s;ent upon the <HI>Judaical Sabbath,</HI> which Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> (a great <HI>Sabbatharian</HI>) doth confe&s;s, <HI>That it was not for the Days &s;ake.</HI> (that the Apo&s;tles &s;o met with the <HI>Jews) but for the Peoples &s;ake, to do them good.</HI> Nay, this Dove-maker <HI>I.A.S.</HI> (who &s;tands upon the <HI>Sabbatharians</HI> &s;ide) will think that him&s;elf can hardly find a better convenience to draw or (rather to) &s;educe others to come to him, than to come upon our Sundays to the Church, and make his Preachments? St. <HI>Paul</HI> did u&s;e Circumci|&s;ion, purified him&s;elf, &s;haved his head for his vow, &amp;c. But mu&s;t we do &s;o now? I think not. The rea&s;on why St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;o conde|&s;cended, was, <HI>That he might gain &s;ome,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.20. and the &s;ame rea&s;on is &s;ufficient for the Apo&s;tles meeting with the <HI>Jews</HI> upon <HI>Sa|turday.</HI> Be&s;ides, it will appear from the Scripture, That as the Apo&s;tles did meet with the Jews upon the <HI>7th Day,</HI> &s;o with the <HI>Gentiles</HI> they did keep the <HI>1&s;t Day,</HI> which we now call <HI>Sunday:</HI> This is plain from <HI>Acts</HI> 13.42.

Surely they who were then gathered together &s;o near to Chri&s;ts and the Apo&s;tles time did know much better than any of us how the Jews Sabbath was kept, and how this our Sabbath was kept. The learned Dr. <HI>White</HI> brings in a Te&s;timony from <HI>Ju&s;t. Martyr</HI> his <HI>Dialogue c. Tryph. p.</HI> 266. (and he lived about 150 years before this Synod) who relates that there was a Que&s;tion made in his time, <Q>Whether a Chri&s;tian which ob&s;erved the Sabbath might be admitted to the holy My&s;teries, or not?</Q> A very good Proof that the Council of <HI>Laodecea</HI> did not fir&s;t of all condemn the Religious Ob&s;ervance of the old Sab|bath. If this <HI>I. A S</HI> had taken coun&s;el, and done according to the advice given him in my Preface, (&s;eeing &s;uch Old Hi&s;tories are &s;carce to be got here, but ea&s;ie to be found in the old Countries) I think he would not &s;o unadvi&s;edly have &s;et his Pen to Paper again&s;t our Sunday. I have &s;een &s;ome of them Canons, but find not that there is Per&s;ecution or Excommunication in any of them, Only that they &s;hould prefer that Day before the &s;eventh. And if that Council had &s;et a Puni&s;hment (which its like they have) upon Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors and Di&s;turbers, I am &s;ure they had Power and Rea|&s;on &s;o to do, and this Author, if then living, would not have e&s;caped their Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>His <HI>12th</HI> and <HI>la&s;t Argument</HI> is of no concern to us; We have now a better Day to re&s;t upon than ever that 7th was, in Memo|rial of that mo&s;t glorious and fruitful Re&s;urrection. What re&s;t could our poor Souls have only of re&s;ting upon the 7th Day, which is only a remembrance of the Creation, if by the Re&s;urrection upon the fir&s;t Day, we were not &s;ure of that eternal Re&s;t in the World to come?</P>
<P>But &s;ome will &s;ay, <HI>Why might not our Souls have re&s;t now in the New-Te&s;tament, as well as they in the Old Te&s;tament had re&s;t in the &s;eventh Day?</HI></P>

<HI>I An&s;wer;</HI> That what was enough for them at that time, is not now enough for us: Chri&s;t was then at that time only <HI>Promi&s;ed to Come,</HI> but now <HI>He is Come:</HI> If he had not been ri&s;en, our grief and trouble had been many fold greater, becau&s;e many fearful Doubts would &s;urround us, as, Was he not that Promi&s;ed Me&s;|&s;iah? Was he not able to ri&s;e? Then are we of all men mo&s;t mi&s;er|able, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.14, &amp;c. but now, becau&s;e he is ri&s;en, and by his Re|&s;urrection ours is made &s;ure, therefore is our Joy much greater, and that Day worthy to be kept by us (in Commemoration of Victory over Death, Hell and the Grave) rather than the 7th Day.</P>
<P>This the Fir&s;t Day is the Day whereupon was made known the be&s;t News that ever was or can be told; 'twas &s;uch News many had a long time waited and longed for. Its apparent that the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t had no re&s;t in their minds or &s;ouls all that time (during the Jews Sabbath) Chri&s;t was dead, but were very &s;orrow|ful, <HI>Luke</HI> 24. But how glad did this Fir&s;t Day make them, when they had the certainty of the Re&s;urrection of their deare&s;t Lord and Ma&s;ter! Never was <HI>Noah</HI> &s;o glad when the Dove brought the Olive Leaf as a token that the Waters were abated; But this was &s;till a better Olive Leaf to the Di&s;ciples, and us all, That Chri&s;t was Ri&s;en, giving them Life and Courage, with a joyful PEACE BE UNTO YOU: A certain Evidence that the whole Deluge of Gods Anger for our &s;ins was dryed up. It is therefore a &s;hame, an unthankful and undutiful thing for any to celebrate the Me|mory of other Peoples Benefits, and neglect and forget their own, which is infinitely better.</P>
<P>That benefit which the <HI>Jews</HI> had is nothing to us, but what we have got is much to them. If <HI>David,</HI> by the &s;pirit of Prophecy &s;aw the Re&s;urrection of our Saviour, and was glad (as in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 16.) how much more ought we to rejoyce, and forever to celebrate that ble&s;&s;ed Day, who know it now in the very deed to be done? We have, indeed, our &s;hare in the Creation, but that work, by the Re&s;urrection (which is much greater) is &s;wallowed up, it I may &s;o &s;ay; &s;o that a true Chri&s;tian, who under&s;tands the Re&s;urrection, can never &s;o remember that, but be will thereby be mindful of the Creation, giving many humble Thanks to God who hath made him, not to be a Stone, Tree, Ox or Hor&s;e, &amp;c. but a rea&s;onable Creature, capable to enjoy the great benefit of the Re&s;urrection.</P>

If the Re|membrance of the Creation was of &s;o great moment to us under the New-Te&s;tament, &s;urely Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles would more at large have in&s;i&s;ted upon that matter than is to be found in all their Writings.

<P>What ground we have for keeping the Fir&s;t Day in the place of the 7th, is, I hope, made plain enough.
