<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>THE Ob&s;ervations on the late and pre&s;ent Conduct of the <HI>French</HI> &amp;c. were wrote towards the latter End of the la&s;t Year; but the Publication of them hath been un|avoidably deferred 'till this Time; they might have been more &s;ea&s;onable when they were fir&s;t wrote, but it is hoped that even now they will not be entirely without their U&s;e.</P>
<P>The Author's De&s;ign did not lead him to a&s;|certain the preci&s;e Boundaries of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Territories in <HI>North-America,</HI> nor yet to lay any Plan for driving the <HI>French</HI> from their late and pre&s;ent Encroachments upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> ones, much le&s;s to make any long De|ductions from the Facts he hath laid down.</P>
<P>His only View was, in the mo&s;t conci&s;e Man|ner, con&s;i&s;tent with Per&s;picuity, to &s;how, that the <HI>French</HI> had made many unwarrantable En|croachments upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Territories in
<PB N="ii" REF="007389_0009_102B8E6BED4F6168"><HI>North-America,</HI> contrary to the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht &amp; Aix-la-Chapelle;</HI> that if they were &s;uffered to go on, or but feebly oppo&s;ed, they would greatly di&s;tre&s;s the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies, and in Time become ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of them all; and finally to &s;how from the State of the Colonies with Relation to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> how far &s;he her &s;elf would be affected by &s;uch a Change of Dominion in <HI>North-America.</HI></P>
<P>The great Armament the <HI>French</HI> have fitted out &s;ince that Time, and &s;ent hither at &s;uch a va&s;t Expence, confirm the Ob&s;ervations upon the Plan of the <HI>French</HI> Court with Regard to this Part of the World, and the near Approaches they have made to the actual Execution of a great Part of it, and are a convincing Proof of the Danger, to which the&s;e Colonies mu&s;t be always expo&s;ed, from the boundle&s;s Ambition of that Court, un|le&s;s a watchful and con&s;tant Attention be given to all their Motions by the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>If this Attention had not been given at this Juncture, <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> now more than ever &s;ecured to the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> would before this Time have been in the Hands of the <HI>French.</HI> Of what fatal Con&s;equence that would have been not only to the re&s;t of his Ma|je&s;ty's Colonies in <HI>North-America,</HI> but to <HI>Great-Britain</HI>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS on the late and pre&s;ent Conduct of the <HI>French,</HI> in NORTH|AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>THE late and pre&s;ent Conduct of the French in <HI>North-America,</HI> is now very ju&s;tly become the Ob|ject of Attention of the Briti&s;h Nation. They are &s;en&s;ible that their un|ju&s;tifiable Encroachments, mu&s;t be attended with bad Con&s;equences to the Briti&s;h Colo|nies there; and that in the Event, <HI>Great|Britain</HI> it&s;elf mu&s;t be greatly affected. But the Sen&s;e of the&s;e Things is, however, &s;o general and indeterminate, that it may not be ami&s;s at this Juncture, plainly and par|ticularly to &s;hew the Importance of the Briti&s;h Colonies in <HI>North-America</HI> to the Mother-Kingdom; and the nece&s;&s;ary fatal Con&s;equences of the pre&s;ent Mea&s;ures the French are pur&s;uing, unle&s;s a &s;peedy and final Stop be put to them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="007389_0013_102B8E7444DD9EE8">
To render the whole more plain and in|telligible, it &s;eems proper, previou&s;ly to mention his Maje&s;ty's undoubted Right to tho&s;e Territories, that the French have been, and are now invading, and fortifying them|&s;elves upon; and to give a &s;uccinct Ac|count of the Encroachments they have made &s;ince the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and the later one of <HI>Aix-la-Chapelle,</HI> with &s;ome other occa&s;ional Remarks.</P>
<P><HI>Seba&s;tian Cabot,</HI> who &s;ailed from <HI>England,</HI> with a Commi&s;&s;ion from <HI>Henry</HI> the VII. fir&s;t di&s;covered the Northern Continent of <HI>America,</HI> in 1497; and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for that Monarch.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to take Notice of what par|ticular Parts of this Continent the French have &s;ince at different Times po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves, which have been afterwards con|firmed to them by Treaty; or to a&s;certain the exact Boundaries of all his Britannick Maje&s;ty's Territories in <HI>North-America.</HI></P>
<P>It will be &s;ufficient for the pre&s;ent Pur|po&s;e, to ob&s;erve, that the Province of <HI>Nova|Scotia,</HI> or <HI>Accadia,</HI> was fir&s;t granted by King <HI>James</HI> I. under certain, determinate Bounds.</P>
<P>That the French were afterwards in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; that during the Time of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they under&s;tood the Limits to extend every Way as far at lea&s;t, as tho&s;e de|&s;cribed in King <HI>James</HI>'s Grant.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="007389_0014_102B8E7681B61C40">
That at the Negotiation for the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> it was expre&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon by the <HI>French</HI> King; that <HI>Accadia,</HI> extended We&s;tward of <HI>St. John's River.</HI></P>
<P>That by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> the &s;aid Province was ceded to the Crown of <HI>Great|Britain,</HI> according to its antient Limits, which was confirmed by the Treaty of <HI>Aix-la-Chapelle;</HI> tho' Commi&s;&s;aries were to be appointed by the re&s;pective Crowns, to &s;ettle the preci&s;e Limits.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> or Indians of the <HI>Five</HI> (now <HI>Six</HI>) <HI>Nations,</HI> as they are commonly called, had voluntarily put them&s;elves under the Protection of the Crown of <HI>Great|Britain,</HI> from the fir&s;t Settlement of the Engli&s;h in that Country.</P>
<P>That it never was di&s;puted before the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> but always agreed by all Authors, whether <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> that <HI>Lake Iroquois,</HI> by the French called <HI>Lake Champlain, Lake Cadaraqui</HI> or <HI>Ontario,</HI> and <HI>Lake Erie,</HI> with the Country adjacent, was the proper Country of the <HI>Iroquois.</HI></P>
<P>That Part of the <HI>Iroquois</HI> formerly in|habited on the North Side of the <HI>Lake Ontario,</HI> and are in the French Maps called <HI>Iroquois du Nord.</HI></P>
<P>That that Part of the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> as it is now called, between <HI>Lake Cadara|qui,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="007389_0015_102B8E7860056728">and where the River <HI>Outawawa,</HI> falls into it near <HI>Mont-Real</HI> was formerly called the River <HI>Iroquois.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>Iroquois</HI> have conquered mo&s;t of the other Tribes inhabiting between them and the River <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi;</HI> and therefore tho&s;e Lands by right of Conque&s;t belong to the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> and as &s;uch are con&s;idered by them.</P>
<P>That by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> the <HI>Iroquois</HI> and their Country are expre&s;ly acknow|ledged to belong to, and be under the Dominion of, the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>That in 1744, at a Conference between the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Colony of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the Deputies of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> at <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> the Deputies of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erted their right to the Soil of the Country claimed by the Colony of <HI>Virginia</HI> from the Mountains backwards; and for a valuable Con&s;idera|tion at that Time &s;old it to that Colony.</P>
<P>That the Colonies of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Connecticut,</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> claim Extent as far We&s;t, as the South Sea founded originally on a Grant of King <HI>James</HI> 1&s;t. in 1606.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the notoriety of the&s;e Facts, and the&s;e expre&s;s Stipulations, the French did, after the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> make &s;ome Encroachments on the North
<PB N="5" REF="007389_0016_102B8E7A4174F490">Ea&s;t Part of the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> for carrying on a Fi&s;hery there.</P>
<P>In the Country of the <HI>Iroquois</HI> they erect|ed &s;everal Fortre&s;&s;es, one between <HI>Lake Erie</HI> and <HI>Lake Ontario,</HI> on the Ea&s;t of the great Falls of <HI>Niagara,</HI> to Command the In|dians that &s;hould pa&s;s by the South Side of the Lakes; another at the We&s;t End of <HI>Lake Erie;</HI> and a very &s;trong one at the South End of <HI>Lake Iroquois</HI> or <HI>Lake Champlain,</HI> commonly called <HI>Crown-Point.</HI> This la&s;t is of the more Importance, as it gives the French the Command of that Lake; &s;erves for a Barrier to <HI>Mont-Real</HI> on that Side; and as a Magazine for Stores, and a Rendezvous for Troops whenever the French, or their Indians make any Incur&s;ions into the Co|lony of <HI>New-York,</HI> or the We&s;tern Frontiers of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> &amp; <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI> It's about One Hundred and twenty Miles from the City of <HI>Albany,</HI> all Water Carriage &s;aving a &s;mall Carrying Place; and Eighty &s;ix Miles from the neare&s;t Part of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River.</P>
<P>The&s;e Encroachments made in Time of Peace before the la&s;t War, they pretend to hold, 'till the Limits of the Territories be|longing to the two Crowns re&s;pectively in <HI>North-America</HI> are &s;ettled by Commi&s;&s;aries. This is common French Policy, or rather Perfidy.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007389_0017_102B8E7C90450230">
The French Court &s;eem always to have made <HI>North-America</HI> an Object of great At|tention; and long ago to have formed a Plan, which they have been &s;teadily, tho' &s;lowly, carrying into Execution.</P>
<P>Since the Treaty of <HI>Aix-la-Chapelle</HI> they have been more ha&s;ty; well knowing of what Advantage it would be to their am|bitious Views of univer&s;al Monarchy to accompli&s;h it. Their Encroachments have been more numerous, their Ho&s;tilities more violent.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> they have erected a Fort near <HI>Bay-Vert;</HI> from whence they have a Communication by Water with <HI>Louisbourgh,</HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> and other French Settlements. They have e|rected another &s;trong one upon the I&s;tmus of the <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> mounted with 26 Cannon, which commands the Ba&s;in and Harbour of <HI>Chiqnecto</HI> or <HI>Bobau&s;&s;in;</HI> and within very near Cannon-Shot of an inferior one built by the Engli&s;h on the other Side of the Ba&s;in. They have &s;eized <HI>St. John</HI>'s River, and erected two Forts there; from one of which they had lately the In&s;olence to fire upon one of the King's Ships. They have engro&s;&s;ed the whole Furr-Trade of that River to them&s;elves; which, before the late Peace, was wholly carried on by the En|gli&s;h.
<PB N="7" REF="007389_0018_102B8E7EF8F76F60">So that in Reality, con&s;idering the Di&s;po&s;ition of the French Inhabitants, and the Indians that are under their Influence and Direction, they are more effectually Ma&s;ters of that whole Province than the Engli&s;h. They have, in Conjunction with the Indians, who have been in&s;tigated by them, committed many Acts of Ho&s;tilities again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's Troops, and other Sub|jects in that Province; killed many, and taken others Pri&s;oners; be&s;ides plundering Ve&s;&s;els and then burning them.</P>
<P>Since the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> they have &s;ettled a con&s;iderable Village on both Sides the River <HI>Chaudiere;</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The River <HI>Chaudiere</HI> empties it&s;elf into the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> on the South Side, a League and an half above the City of <HI>Quebec.</HI></NOTE> At &s;ome Leagues di&s;tance from the Southerly Bank of the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> about twenty Leagues up this River (<HI>Chaudiere</HI>) there is a Land Carriage of a few Miles to the River <HI>Kennebeck.</HI> At this Place, if they have not already built a Fort, there has been good Intelligence that they had de&s;igned one. From hence the whole Force of <HI>Canada</HI> might, in a few Days, be poured into the Ea&s;tern Parts of the Colony of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay;</HI> the great Nur&s;ery of Trees for Ma&s;ts, Yards, and Bow&s;prits, for the Royal Navy.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007389_0019_102B8E80D609A1D0">
Since the Treaty of <HI>Aix-la-Chapelle,</HI> they have erected &s;everal more Fortre&s;&s;es in the Country of the <HI>Iroquois:</HI> One upon the North Side of the Lake <HI>Ontario</HI> directly oppo&s;ite to the Engli&s;h Fort at <HI>O&s;wego</HI> on the South Side, (called by them Fort <HI>Trunto</HI>) at the Place where the Indians, that come by the North Side of the Lakes, u&s;ed to pa&s;s this Lake in order to Trade at <HI>O&s;wego.</HI> They have built a large &s;trong Stone trading Hou&s;e between the Lakes <HI>Erie</HI> and <HI>Ontario,</HI> to the We&s;tward of the great Falls of <HI>Niagara,</HI> to prevent the Indians pa&s;&s;ing the South Side of the Lakes to <HI>O&s;wego.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1753, they marched a large armed Force, con&s;i&s;ting of Regulars, Militia and Indians, from <HI>Mont-Real</HI> into the Country of the <HI>Iroquois;</HI> altho' forbid by the Indians by three &s;everal Me&s;&s;ages, and threatned to de&s;troy all the Indians that &s;hould oppo&s;e them: The &s;ame Year they built two Forts, one upon a River that empties it&s;elf into the Lake <HI>Erie,</HI> the other at fifteen Miles di&s;tance on the River <HI>Ob&egrave;uf,</HI> which falls into the River <HI>Ohio.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The River <HI>Ohio,</HI> in the Indian Language, means the &s;ame as <HI>Belle Riviere</HI> in the French. It is a &s;mooth ea&s;y River, not interrupted with Falls; for what is called the Falls near where it is joined by the River <HI>Ouba&s;che,</HI> is nothing more than a Ripling.

<P>The far greater Number of the Indians, live upon tho&s;e Branches of this River that come into it from the Northward, and &s;till further to the Northward; the Engli&s;h Settlements are to the Southward: This River therefore with the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> and the inter|vening lakes, form a perfect Communication between <HI>Quebec</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> and a Line of Separation when filled with French Forts and Settlements between the far greater Number of the Indians, and the Engli&s;h Settlements.</P></NOTE></P>

Early the next Year, the French march|ed to a &s;mall Engli&s;h Fort at the Forks of <HI>Mohongahala,</HI> lower down the River <HI>Ohio;</HI> garri&s;oned by a &s;mall Number of People from <HI>Virginia,</HI> who were obliged to &s;ur|render upon Terms on the fir&s;t Summons.</P>
<P>Some Time after the &s;ame Year, a Body of eleven Hundred Men, French and Indians attacked Major <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Virginia</HI> Forces, who&s;e Corps con&s;i&s;ted of but about three Hundred Men, &amp; obliged him to &s;urrender upon Articles of Capitula|tion.</P>

They have likewi&s;e built two Ve&s;&s;els like our Brigantines, of about 60 or 70 Tons for Tran&s;portation on the Lake <HI>Ontario.</HI> The&s;e Lakes are large Inland Seas, navigable by Ve&s;&s;els of a con&s;iderable Burthen.</P>
<P>By the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> confirmed by the Treaty of <HI>Aix-la-Chapelle,</HI> it is expre&s;ly &s;tipulated that the French &s;hall have Liberty of pa&s;&s;ing into the Country of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and other Indians in Friend&s;hip with <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for the &s;ake of Com|merce; and that the Engli&s;h &s;hall have the &s;ame Liberty of pa&s;&s;ing into the Countries of the Indians in Friend&s;hip with the French on the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Since the la&s;t Treaty, the French have plundered &s;everal of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects trading, not in the Countries of the Indians in Friend&s;hip with the French, but in the Countries of the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> and other Indian Nations in Friend&s;hip with <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> of Goods to a very great Value; killed &s;ome, made others Pri&s;oners, and tran&s;ported &s;e|veral to <HI>Old-France.</HI> They have lately
<PB N="11" REF="007389_0022_102B8E867B6903D0">avowed in the mo&s;t publick Manner, their determined Re&s;olution to make Pri&s;oners all his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, that they &s;hall find trading in tho&s;e Countries, and to con|fi&s;cate their Effects.</P>
<P>This Conduct of the French has deterred all the Traders of his Maje&s;ty's Colonies, from pa&s;&s;ing into the Indian Countries for the &s;ake of Commerce; altho' before the&s;e Ho&s;tilities of the French, three Hundred Traders went yearly from the &s;ingle Colony of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e open Ho&s;tilities, and Bare|faced Encroachments, the French are con|tinually making u&s;e of every Art, Policy can &s;ugge&s;t, with the greate&s;t Indu&s;try humane Nature is capable of, to &s;educe the Indians in Alliance with the Engli&s;h, and draw them over to their Intere&s;t. For this Purpo&s;e, the mo&s;t artful &amp; zealous of their Mi&s;&s;ionaries are &s;ent among them: The lower People are encouraged to live among&s;t and intermarry with the Natives. The Prie&s;ts after they are admitted among&s;t them, &s;oon gain a great A&s;cendency over them. They make u&s;e of the Religion they teach them, to in&s;pire them with the greate&s;t hatred to the Engli&s;h, and Attach|ment to the French. In this they have had but too much Succe&s;s; a&s;&s;i&s;ted as they have
<PB N="12" REF="007389_0023_102B8E8940216E98">been, by the bad Conduct of &s;ome of the Engli&s;h Governments, to the Indians of the mo&s;t Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Many Years ago, a Number of the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> the mo&s;t antient and faithful Allies of the Engli&s;h, and the mo&s;t War-like of all the Indian Nations; went off and &s;ettled above <HI>Mont-Real.</HI> They have lately per&s;uaded one Half of the <HI>Onondago</HI> Tribe, with many other Indians to remove; and have built them a Church and Fort. Many of the <HI>Seneka</HI>'s, the mo&s;t numerous Tribe of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> appear to be much inclined to the French; and there is great Rea&s;on to fear that the whole Body of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> will &s;oon be lo&s;t to the Crown of <HI>Great|Britain,</HI> and gained by the French; unle&s;s &s;ome proper Mea&s;ures be taken to prevent them, and to regain tho&s;e that are lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Indians in the French Intere&s;t are, upon all proper Opportunities, in&s;tigated by their Prie&s;ts, who have generally the chief Management of their publick Councils, to Acts of Ho&s;tility again&s;t the Engli&s;h, even in Time of profound Peace between the two Crowns. Of this there are many un|deniable In&s;tances: The War between the Indians &amp; the Colonies of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts|Bay, &amp; New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> in 1723; by which tho&s;e Colonies &s;uffered &s;o much Damage,
<PB N="13" REF="007389_0024_102B8E8AC8A921F0">was begun by the In&s;tigation of the French; their Supplies were from them, and there are now original Letters of &s;everal Je&s;uits to be produced; whereby it evidently ap|pears, that they were continually animat|ing the Indians, when almo&s;t tired with the War, to a further Pro&s;ecution of it. The French not only excited the Indians and &s;upplied them, but joined their own Forces with them in all the late Ho&s;tlities that have been committed within his Maje&s;ty's Pro|vince of <HI>Nova-Scotia.</HI></P>
<P>From an intercepted Letter this Year from the Je&s;uit at <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> and from other Information, it is certain that they have been u&s;ing their utmo&s;t Endeavours to ex|cite the Indians to new Acts of Ho&s;tility a|gain&s;t his Maje&s;ty's Colony of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|etts-Bay,</HI> and &s;ome have been committed.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the writing this, the Indians at the In&s;tigation of the French have committed numerous Ho&s;tilities upon the Engli&s;h, in the Governments of <HI>Virginia, Maryland, New-York, New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts|Bay,</HI> and the two la&s;t Governments have declared War-again&s;t &s;everal Tribes of the <HI>Abinaqui</HI> Indians.</NOTE></P>
<P>The French not only excite the Indians to Acts of Ho&s;tility, but Reward them for it, by buying the Engli&s;h Pri&s;oners of them; for the Ran&s;om of each of which, they afterwards demand the Price that is u&s;ually
<PB N="14" REF="007389_0025_102B8E8CA75A0920">given for a Slave in the&s;e Colonies. They do this under the &s;pecious Pretence of re&s;cu|ing the poor Pri&s;oners from the Cruelties and Barbarities of the Savages; but in Re|ality to encourage them to continue their Depredations; as they can by this Means get more by hunting the Engli&s;h, than by hunting Wild-Bea&s;ts; while in Reality the French at the &s;ame Time, keep up a large Army of Indians entirely at the Expence of the Engli&s;h, without any to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is very uncertain, &amp; difficult to gue&s;s, what may be the Number of Indians &s;catter|ed upon the back of the Engli&s;h &amp; French Settlements, thro' this va&s;t Continent. But if the Account be true, or near true that was given in an open Council of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> at <HI>Turpehawkie,</HI> on their return from the Treaty at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in 1742, there mu&s;t be a <HI>great many Thou&s;and</HI> of them.</P>
<P>And altho' the Indians live &s;cattered, as a Hunter's Life requires; they may be collected together from almo&s;t any Di&s;tance, as they can find their Sub&s;i&s;tence from their Gun in their Travelling.</P>
<P>But let the Number of the Indians be what it will, they are not formidable meer|ly on Account of their Numbers; there are many other Circum&s;tances that give them a great Advantage over the Engli&s;h.</P>

<P>Bnt to return from the&s;e occa&s;ional Re|marks, and to point out the Con&s;equences of the pre&s;ent Mea&s;ures of the French, if they are &s;uffered to pur&s;ue them:</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and mo&s;t immediate will be the engro&s;&s;ing the whole Furr and Pelt Trade. The Furrs and Pelts imported into <HI>England,</HI> have been computed to amount to about &pound;. 90,000 Sterling per Annum, be&s;ides what are u&s;ed in the Plantations, which is no in|con&s;iderable Quantity; but I believe greatly exceed that Sum. What Part is imported from <HI>North-America,</HI> and what from the Nothern Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> I cannot tell. The
<PB N="17" REF="007389_0028_102B8E92F24EB538">whole Indian Trade of <HI>North-America,</HI> is carried on entirely by Barter; and that chiefly, &amp; indeed almo&s;t wholly for Strouds, Duffils, Blankets, &amp; other Manufactures of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Trade therefore is of great Con&s;equence, and if it was properly pro&s;e|cuted, the Advantages ari&s;ing to <HI>Great|Britain,</HI> would be in Proportion to its In|crea&s;e; not only as it would occa&s;ion a greater Con&s;umption of Briti&s;h Manufac|tures, but likewi&s;e as it would bring in a greater Quantity of tho&s;e valuable Com|modities, which <HI>Great-Britain</HI> mu&s;t other|wi&s;e Purcha&s;e from other Powers at a dearer Rate, and Pay for in Money too. The Indians may be &s;upplied cheaper from the Engli&s;h, than from the French; this is very evident, ina&s;much as the French are frequently &s;upplied from <HI>Albany,</HI> by the Means of their Indians (who are really Factors for the French) with great Part of their Goods at an advanced Price, and yet have their own Profit upon them, when they &s;ell them to the Indians.&mdash;The Engli&s;h Colonies are better &s;ituated, were it not for the French Encroachments, to carry the Trade into the Indian Country, than tho&s;e of the French; and are there|fore capable of increa&s;ing and extending
<PB N="18" REF="007389_0029_102B8E947B05AA38">this Trade to a greater Advantage than they. But notwith&s;tanding the Advan|tages of the Engli&s;h, and the Di&s;advantages of the French, the latter have always pu&s;hed it on with greater Vigour, and have always had by much the large&s;t Share of it: Neither is this much to be wondered at, &s;ince the French of <HI>Canada</HI> have &s;carce any other Trade but this; and this is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to that Settlement, that if they were once to be cut off from it, that mu&s;t &s;oon langui&s;h and decay: Be&s;ides that the Tax paid by the Company on this Trade, is one of the principal Funds from whence the Supplies are rai&s;ed for defraying the Charges of that Government.</P>
<P>The Pelts &amp; Furrs imported into <HI>France,</HI> amounted &s;ome Years ago, to no le&s;s than &pound;.135,000 Sterling per Annum; and &s;ince that Time, the French Trade in tho&s;e Commodities has been continually increa|&s;ing, whil&s;t that of the Engli&s;h hath been dimini&s;hing; and in a little Time will, very probably, nay, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be entirely lo&s;t to the Engli&s;h &amp; gained by the French, if the latter are &s;uffered to continue po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their pre&s;ent Encroachments, and to &s;trengthen them&s;elves in them.</P>
<P>Whoever will compare the Account al|ready given of the&s;e Encroachments, with
<PB N="19" REF="007389_0030_102B8E975057F1D8">the Map of the Country, mu&s;t &s;ee at the fir&s;t View that they have taken, &amp; are tak|ing Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and fortifying all the mo&s;t important Places upon the Lakes &amp; Rivers, upon the Back of all the Northern Colonies; by which the Indians mu&s;t pa&s;s from their Country to Trade with the Engli&s;h, or the Engli&s;h into the Indian Country on the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When they &s;hall have &s;ufficiently &s;trength|ened them&s;elves in the&s;e, they will effectu|ally cut off all Communication between the Indians and the Engli&s;h Settlements; and oblige the Natives to Trade &s;olely with them, whether they will or no. Be&s;ides, the Natives will find it more for their Ad|vantage in that Ca&s;e to Trade with the French, than with the Engli&s;h: For as the French, with their Forts, will carry their Trade into the different Parts of the Indian Country, can any one imagine the Indians will carry their Goods many Hundred Miles, attended with great fatigue and difficulty; to exchange them for tho&s;e very Com|modities that they can be &s;upplied with for the &s;ame Goods, in a Manner at their own Doors? No certainly they will not.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the engro&s;&s;ing this Trade to them|&s;elves, the French will, in a little Time, draw all the Indians entirely off from the
<PB N="20" REF="007389_0031_102B8E992C125D28">Engli&s;h, and firmly attach them to their In|tere&s;t. The cutting off the Communica|tion between the Engli&s;h and the Indians by the French Forts and Settlements, will oblige the Indians to Trade with the French, whether they will or no. Their carrying the Trade into the Indian Country, and &s;upplying them with the Commodities they want at their own Doors, will make it their Intere&s;t to Trade with them. This Exchange of Commodities, if properly regulated, will attach the Indians to the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e that &s;upply them with what they cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without. But above all, the Vigour and Re&s;olution of the French in carrying on Settlements, building Forts &amp; &s;trength|ening them&s;elves in them at &s;uch a Di&s;tance from their pre&s;ent Country, few as their Inhabitants are, will give them a high Opinion of the French Courage, and create a Dependance upon them. On the other Hand, the tame Behaviour of the Engli&s;h in looking quietly on, or in making but a feeble Re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the&s;e violent En|croachments, while their Intere&s;t is &s;o deep|ly concerned, their Colonies are &s;o many, and their Inhabitants &s;o numerous, will give them a mean, contemptible Opinion of them: They will look upon the Engli&s;h as da&s;tardly Cowards; upon the French as
<PB N="21" REF="007389_0032_102B8E9B0FCBC320">brave Men; upon the one as fit to be re|lied upon for Protection; on the other as unworthy of the lea&s;t Confidence, &amp; rather wanting A&s;&s;i&s;tance &amp; Protection from them, than capable of affording them any.</P>
<P>A Sachem of one of the Tribes of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> publickly Reproached the Engli&s;h with this at the late Conference between Commi&s;&s;ioners from the Briti&s;h Govern|ments, and the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> at <HI>Albany.</HI> Ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Commi&s;&s;ioners: "You talk, &s;aid he, of your Strength, where do we &s;ee it? The French build Forts, and keep them when they have done; the Engli&s;h do not hinder them: The French behave like Men, the Engli&s;h like Women."</P>
<P>The <HI>Six Nations</HI> are the brave&s;t Warriors of all the Indians. They have always been in Alliance with the Engli&s;h, and had for|merly the greate&s;t Aver&s;ion to the French. They once not only threatned, but had very near compleated the De&s;truction of <HI>Canada:</HI> But from the Neglect of the Engli&s;h to cultivate this Temper, and indeed from a direct contrary Conduct in &s;ome of the Governments, and from the Indu&s;try and A&s;&s;iduity of the French to gain them to their Intere&s;t; many went off and &s;ettled among&s;t the French a long Time ago; a great Number are lately gone off; tho&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="007389_0033_102B8E9CD0D3D0C8">that remain are very wavering in their Affections to the Engli&s;h, and there is not the lea&s;t Doubt to be made but that they will entirely abandon us; and that in a very little Time, if they have not already agreed to do it, unle&s;s we behave with more Di&s;cretion and Ju&s;tice towards them, &amp; more Vigour and Re&s;olution again&s;t the French.</P>
<P>If this &s;hould be the Ca&s;e; if the&s;e In|dians &s;hould be gained to the French and the numerous Tribes in Alliance with them, all the re&s;t of the Indians upon the whole Continent would infallibly be brought into the &s;ame Intere&s;t. What U&s;e the French would make of the&s;e new Allies, we know too well from pa&s;t Experience. They would mo&s;t certainly employ them even in Time of profound Peace between the two Crowns, again&s;t any or all the Briti&s;h Settle|ments as would be&s;t &s;uit their ambitious Views and De&s;igns.</P>
<P>It has been already remarked, that the Tribes of Indians living upon the Lakes and the Rivers that run upon the Back of the Engli&s;h Settlements in <HI>North-America,</HI> are very numerous, and can furni&s;h a great Number of fighting Men; all perfectly well acquainted with the U&s;e of Arms as &s;oon as capable of carrying them; as they get the whole of their Sub&s;i&s;tence from hunting;
<PB N="23" REF="007389_0034_102B8E9F63788160">and that this Army, large as it may be, can be maintained by the French without any Expence.</P>
<P>Fom their Numbers, their Situation and the Rivers that run into the Engli&s;h Settlements, it is ea&s;y to conceive that they can at any Time make an Attack upon and con&s;tantly Annoy as many of the ex|po&s;ed Engli&s;h Settlements as they plea&s;e; and tho&s;e at any Di&s;tance from each other.</P>
<P>The Effects of &s;uch Incur&s;ions have been too &s;everely felt by many of the Briti&s;h Co|lonies, e&s;pecially in the Ea&s;tern Parts of <HI>New|England,</HI> not to be very well known. The entire breaking up Places that had been for a con&s;iderable Time &s;ettled at a great Expence, both of Labour and Money; burning the Hou&s;es, de&s;troying the Stock, killing and making Pri&s;oners great Numbers of the Inhabitants; with all the cruel U&s;age they meet with in their Captivity, is only a Part of the Scene. All other Places that are expo&s;ed are kept in continual Terror; the Lands lay wa&s;te and uncultivated from the Danger that attends tho&s;e that &s;hall pre&s;ume to Work upon them: Be&s;ides the immen&s;e Charge the Governments mu&s;t be at in a very ineffectual Manner to defend their extended Frontiers; and all this from the Influence the French have had over, but
<PB N="24" REF="007389_0035_102B8EA1A1938520">comparatively a few of the Indians. To the &s;ame or greater Evils &s;till will every one of the Colonies be expo&s;ed whenever the &s;ame Influence &s;hall be extended to the whole Body of them.</P>
<P><HI>South-Carolina</HI> may be ea&s;ily annoyed in this Manner by the Indians that live near the French Settlements upon the River <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> and the Branches of the other Rivers that run into it. <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> in|deed hath this Advantage at pre&s;ent, that the&s;e Indians have been for a long Time, and are &s;till in &s;trict Alliance with them; and whil&s;t they continue clo&s;ely attached to their Intere&s;t, they will be a Barrier to them again&s;t the French and their Indians: But this is a very precarious Dependence, con&s;idering how ea&s;y it will be for the French, after they have gained the re&s;t of the numerous Tribes, to &s;ecure them al&s;o to their Intere&s;t, or el&s;e to employ their Indians to cut them off.</P>
<P>The late and pre&s;ent Enterpri&s;es of the French, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Indians upon the Borders of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania, Mary|land, Virginia,</HI> and <HI>North-Carolina;</HI> are too &s;trong Proofs how much they are expo&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>New-York</HI> is not more &s;ecure; but on the contrary, if the French &s;hould gain the <HI>Six Nations</HI> to their Intere&s;t (of which there
<PB N="25" REF="007389_0036_102B8EA328EC22A0">is the greate&s;t Danger) as the&s;e are the mo&s;t War-like of all the Indians, as they are perfectly well acquainted with that Country, and might perhaps have a par|ticular Re&s;entment again&s;t that Colony; and at the &s;ame Time can be ea&s;ily &s;upplied by Water from the French Magazine at <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> with Ammunition and Pro|vi&s;ions; this Colony would perhaps be more expo&s;ed than almo&s;t any other to the mo&s;t cruel Ravages and Depredations.</P>
<P>The Colonies of <HI>New-Jer&s;eys, Connecticut</HI> and <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> are at pre&s;ent &s;ecured, by having &s;ome of the other Colonies as a Bar|rier to them.</P>
<P>The We&s;tern Parts of the Colonies of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> lay open to the Incur&s;ions of the Indians, that may be &s;upplied from <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> it being not quite ninety Miles from that Fort to <HI>Connecticut-River.</HI> But the Ea&s;tern Parts of the&s;e Provinces, e&s;pecially the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> are &s;till more expo&s;ed, and have been often and for a long Time together, thro' the In&s;tigation of our good Allies the <HI>French,</HI> the Theatre of War.</P>
<P>The <HI>St. John</HI>'s and other <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> In|dians, whom the French have gained to an entire Dependance upon them, may be em|ployed either again&s;t the Ea&s;tern Parts of
<PB N="26" REF="007389_0037_102B8EA50C32E8D8"><HI>New-England,</HI> or the Province of <HI>Nova|Scotia.</HI></P>
<P>The Damage the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> has already &s;uffered from them, at the In&s;ti|gation and with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French, has been &s;uch, as has hitherto prevented their making Settlements back into the Country, whereon they might rai&s;e their own Sub|&s;i&s;tence, and threatens, if not remedied, to prevent any future Settlement of that Coun|try by the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it cannot be doubted that if the French &s;hould engro&s;s the Furr Trade to them&s;elves, and attach the Indians firmly to their Intere&s;t, they would never want Inclination nor Power to employ them, even <HI>in Time of profound Peace between the two Crowns,</HI> to harra&s;s any Number of the Engli&s;h Colonies as &s;hould be&s;t &s;uit their Purpo&s;es; which, be&s;ides all the other Evils already mentioned, would be attended with this, that it would effectually hinder the In|crea&s;e and Settlement of his Maje&s;ty's Ter|ritories, whil&s;t it would give the French an Opportunity to increa&s;e &amp; &s;ettle their own, and not only their own, but &s;uch Part of his Maje&s;ty's as they have unju&s;tly taken Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of.</P>

That the French have had this in View from the Beginning of their Settlements in <HI>North-America,</HI> &s;eems clear from their &s;ur|rounding the Engli&s;h Colonies, and building Forts upon the Lakes, and mo&s;t convenient Rivers on the Back of the Engli&s;h Settle|ments from <HI>St. Lawrence-River</HI> to <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> and claiming an exclu&s;ive Navigation in tho&s;e Lakes and Rivers, and the Property of all that Part of the Continent.</P>

<P>One great, and indeed main Security of the Engli&s;h Colonies in <HI>North-America,</HI> a|gain&s;t the fatal Effects of the French En|croachment, con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the French Settlements at pre&s;ent are not capable of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting a Body of Troops &s;trong enough to over-run the Engli&s;h Settlements; but &s;hould the French make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> which is a Country fruitful of all Kind of Grain and Provi&s;ions; they would be in a Condition to introduce and &s;ub&s;i&s;t a Body of Troops &s;trong enough with the French <HI>Acadians,</HI> and Inhabitants of <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> together with the <HI>Indians,</HI> to reduce all the Engli&s;h Colo|nies.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="007389_0043_102B8EB0D7C97A40">
Another great Security to the Engli&s;h Colonies, is that the French have no con|venient Harbours, but only in the I&s;land of <HI>Cape-Breton;</HI> but &s;hould they make them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> they might from their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o large a Sea-Coa&s;t extending from <HI>Cape-Sable</HI> to <HI>Cape-Canceau,</HI> ninety Leagues upon the Atlantic Ocean, abounding with mo&s;t commodious Harbours for Ships of the large&s;t Burthen, be in a Condition to di&s;pute the Ma&s;tery of tho&s;e Seas.

<P>This may appear very extraordinary at fir&s;t View, con&s;idering the &s;uperiour Number of Inhabitants within the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to tho&s;e of the <HI>French</HI> Colonies, e&s;pecially as the Engli&s;h are Ma&s;ters of &s;uch a large Sea|Coa&s;t: But if the Advantages which the Form of Government in the French Colo|nies gives them, over that of the Engli&s;h Colonies in Time of War is con&s;idered, this will not &s;eem an improbable Suppo&s;ition. All the French Settlements in <HI>North-Ame|rica,</HI> how many &s;mall Governments &s;oever they may be divided into, are under the ab|&s;olute Command of the Governor of <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Colonies, exclu&s;ive of <HI>Georgia</HI> and <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> are divided into eleven di&s;tinct Governments, within each of which nothing of any Con&s;equence can be tran&s;|acted but by their re&s;pective A&s;&s;emblies.

Of this there is a mo&s;t melancholly Proof at this very Time, &s;ince not with &s;tanding the pre&s;ent common Danger, no two Governments can agree up|on any Mea&s;ures, nor has any one Govern|ment &s;eparately, except the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts|Bay,</HI> acted with any Degree of Vigour; much le&s;s with that Vigour that the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances demand.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At that Time the Expedition to <HI>Crown-Point</HI> was not on Foot.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is ea&s;y therefore to conceive, that a large Body of Men, Part of them regular Troops, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Indians, &s;cattered thro' the Continent, upon the Back of all the Engli&s;h Colonies, (as the French Settle|ments likewi&s;e are) when under the ab&s;olute Command of one Governor-General, who upon all Emergencies can direct their Force as he plea&s;es, may reduce a Number of di&s;|united independent Colonies, un&s;upported with regular Troops, tho' much &s;uperior to them in Point of the Number of Inhabitants.</P>

The Effects of this Difference of Govern|ment within the <HI>French &amp; Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies were mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt in the late War.

What Addition is made to her Commerce, and Con&s;equently her Wealth, Strength and Superiority of Naval Power, by her being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o many large Colonies, and par|ticularly how far her Colonies in <HI>North|America</HI> conduce to the Support &amp; Increa&s;e of the&s;e, will appear from the following Remarks.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the Colonies in <HI>North|America</HI> make a large Addition to the Sub|jects of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> The Extent of the&s;e Colonies, exclu&s;ive of the I&s;land of <HI>New|foundland,</HI> &amp; mea&s;uring it upon the Sea-Coa&s;t from <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> to <HI>Georgia,</HI> inclu&s;ive of both, is about five Hundred Leagues, &amp; the Depth of them as far back as the South Sea.</P>
<P>The Settlements, which are chiefly on the Sea-Coa&s;t, may be computed to contain a|bove One Million Inhabitants, exclu&s;ive of Indian Savages and Negro Slaves.</P>
<P>The&s;e Inhabitants within the Compa&s;s of one Hundred and forty Years, from which Time the utmo&s;t AEra of the elde&s;t of the&s;e Colonies is to be dated, have from &s;mall Drafts made out of the Mother-Country and her Dependencies, chiefly in the Begin|ning of their Settlements, grown to their pre&s;ent Number by the natural Increa&s;e of the People, &s;aving what Addition they have
<PB N="37" REF="007389_0048_102B8EBAC6239820">received by &s;uch as have tran&s;planted them|&s;elves from the Northern Parts of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>It has been found by A&s;&s;e&s;sments made from Time to Time of the rateable Polls in the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> where there are now near two hundred Thou&s;and Inhabitants, that taking their Increa&s;e at a Medium, from the fir&s;t Settlement of the Colony to the Year 1743, they have doubled their Number once in twenty Years.</P>
<P>If this &s;hould not be thought an equitable Rule of e&s;timating the future Growth of the Inhabitants within this Province, when their Number is &s;o large, (tho' it &s;eems it &s;hould hold good as long as there is Room enough for them to &s;pread) yet it &s;eems a moderate Computation to reckon, that their pre&s;ent Number may be doubled at the End of thirty Years, and if that is a ju&s;t Rule for rating the Increa&s;e of the Inhabitants with|in the other Colonies, as it &s;eems to be, then the Number of Inhabitants within all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>North-America,</HI> may be expected from their natural Increa&s;e, and without making any Allowance for the tran&s;planting of Prote&s;tant Families from the <HI>Palatinate, Swi&s;s</HI> Cantons, and other Nor|thern Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> to amount at the End of that Period to near three Millions.</P>

More di&s;tant Calculations may &s;eem too remote and uncertain; it may &s;uffice to Remark that from the general Healthful|ne&s;s of the Climate thro' the whole Range of the&s;e Colonies, and the immen&s;e Tracts of Lands fit for all Kind of Agriculture, that this Territory is capable of &s;upporting as many Inhabitants at lea&s;t as any King|dom in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Advantage accruing to the Mother|Country from the great Number of Inhabi|tants in her Northern Colonies, will appear from the Con&s;ideration of the Con&s;umption they will occa&s;ion of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures, and al&s;o of all other <HI>European</HI> Commodities in general, which la&s;t mu&s;t be landed and re&s;hip'd in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> (which is by the Acts of Trade made the Staple of them for all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies) before they can be imported into <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter into a Detail of the <HI>Eu|ropean</HI> Commodities which are con&s;umed within the Colonies, or a Computation of what Number of Hands their pre&s;ent Inha|bitants may employ in <HI>England,</HI> for furni&s;h|ing them with the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> ones: Extracts from the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Books of the Goods exported for the Colonies, have &s;hewn them to be very large at pre&s;ent; what is export|ed for <HI>New-England</HI> only amounting to <HI>Four

It is computed that near Half the pre&s;ent Shipping of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is improved in the Commerce carried on with her Plantations, which Trade alone will in Time employ a much greater Quantity of Shipping, than all the pre&s;ent Shipping of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Be&s;ides, this Trade will enable her with greater Advantage to extend her Commerce with other Countries.</P>
<P>Another Remark relates to the Fi&s;heries carried on in the adjacent Seas: Very par|ticular E&s;timates have been made of the <HI>New-England</HI> Cod-Fi&s;hery, whereby the Returns of it appear to be (exclu&s;ive of the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Fi&s;hery, for all of which there is a &s;ufficient Market) above <HI>One Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> Sterling per Annum. All this Fi&s;h, except what is con&s;umed in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> which is but an incon&s;iderable Part of it, is exported to <HI>Portugal, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and there &s;old for Gold, or Bills of Exchange payable in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> from whence Re|turns
<PB N="40" REF="007389_0051_102B8EBE7AD77A00">are made to the Colonies in Engli&s;h Goods; &s;o that the Produce of the Fi&s;hery, as well as the Profit of furni&s;hing the Out|&s;et of it, center in the Mother-Country.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, a Whale-Fi&s;hery is carried on within the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts|Bay,</HI> from whence con&s;iderable Quantities of Oil are yearly exported to <HI>England,</HI> per|haps to the Amount of <HI>Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> Sterling, or more annually, the prime Co&s;t in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>The Profits of the&s;e Fi&s;heries are the more Beneficial, as they are gained out of the Sea, (a Fund not to be exhau&s;ted) and find Em|ployment for a great Number of Hands, many of which might be u&s;ele&s;s, or but of &s;mall Account on Shore; as is found to be the Ca&s;e of mo&s;t Countries with Re&s;pect to the Refu&s;e Part of their Inhabitants: And Fi&s;heries are more particularly advantage|ous to a Maritime Power, as they breed up the be&s;t of Sailors. The Cod-Fi&s;hery of <HI>New-England</HI> has therefore been ever ju&s;tly e&s;teemed a good Nur&s;ery of Seamen for the Royal Navy, &amp; it has the Advantage even of the Engli&s;h Colliery in this Re&s;pect, that whereas five or &s;ix Hands are &s;ufficient to navigate a Collier of a large Burthen, a great|er Number of Hands is nece&s;&s;ary to be em|ployed on Board a Fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;el of fifty
<PB N="41" REF="007389_0052_102B8EC05AD49760">Tons, for navigating it, and catching &amp; cur|ing the Fi&s;h; all of whom may bereckon|ed good Seamen, or at lea&s;t very fit for im|mediate Service on Board the King's Ships.</P>
<P>The next Remark relates to the Naval Stores: Every Species of the&s;e is of the Growth and Produce of the Northern Co|lonies. The Royal Navy is almo&s;t wholly &s;upplied from the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts-Bay</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> with Ma&s;ts, Yards and Bow&s;prits; as the Shipping of <HI>England</HI> in general is with Pitch and Tar from <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Article it may be ob&s;erved, that it is an invaluable Advantage to a Maritime Power to have its Naval Stores of the Pro|duce of it's own Dominions, independent of a Foreign State, and not liable to be cut off from them by the Accident of War, or Prohibition of the Prince, in who&s;e Dominion they mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed: To have them likewi&s;e imported in it's own Shipping, at rea&s;onable Rates, and in Exchange for it's own Manufactures.</P>
<P>The Difference between being dependent upon a foreign Power for any of the&s;e Stores, and having them of the Growth of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Territories, is remarkable in the Article of Tar. When <HI>Great Britain</HI> was obliged to take that Species from the Northern
<PB N="42" REF="007389_0053_102B8EC289E883A8">Powers, the Price of it ro&s;e to <HI>five Pounds</HI> Sterling per Barrel; and <HI>Sweden</HI> in the Year 1710 refu&s;ed to let it be exported in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els. This Impo&s;ition occa&s;ioned a Bounty to be given by Parliament for the Encouragement of rai&s;ing Tar in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>North-America,</HI> the Effect of which has been to lower the Price of it to a tenth Part of what was before given; and to be paid for to Subjects of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures, in&s;tead of being paid for to Foreigners in Silver and Gold.</P>
<P><HI>Great-Britain</HI> may likewi&s;e in Time be &s;upplied from her Northern Colonies with Bar Iron, Hemp and Pot-A&s;h. Pot-A&s;h has been made in <HI>New-England,</HI> and that of the be&s;t Quality and imported from thence to <HI>Eng|land:</HI> And was the Method of making it publickly known, <HI>Great-Britain</HI> might be &s;upplied from her Colonies in <HI>North-Ame|rica</HI> with her whole Con&s;umption of that Article.</P>
<P>The next Remark relates to the rich Com|modities of Furrs, Tobacco
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are about 85,000 Hog&s;heads of Tobacco exported annually from <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland.</HI></NOTE> &amp; Rice, which are the Produce of the&s;e Colonies.

<P>The next Thing to be remarked is, that the Lumber, Hor&s;es and Fi&s;h (not to mention the Flower and Pork) with which <HI>North|America</HI> &s;upplies the Sugar Colonies, are ne|ce&s;&s;ary for carrying on the Sugar Works in the Plantations there, &amp; for the Sub&s;i&s;tence of their Negroes, &s;o that the Support of the&s;e I&s;lands, depends upon that of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Northern Colonies: Were tho&s;e to be lo&s;t, the Sugar I&s;lands, independent of their being conquered by the <HI>French,</HI> would &s;oon lan|gui&s;h and decay to &s;uch a Degree as to be of little Service to the Mother-Country.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Remark to be made is, that the Prince, who holds Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>North-America,</HI> will be in a Con|dition to keep the Sovereignty of the Atlan|tic Ocean, thro' which the homeward bound Trade from the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies gene|rally pa&s;&s;es: This evidently appears from the Extent of the Sea-Coa&s;t, which the Co|lonies of <HI>North-America</HI> take up, abounding with mo&s;t commodious Harbours, from
<PB N="44" REF="007389_0055_102B8EC69E2C0790">whence the Ships pa&s;&s;ing thro' tho&s;e Seas, may be intercepted. <HI>France</HI> mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt the Effects of it during the la&s;t War in the Captures made by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of their Trade in general, returning from tho&s;e Parts: And it is well known that the Harbour of <HI>Louisbourg</HI> is the Rendezvous of the <HI>French</HI> Ea&s;t-India and South-Sea Trade in their Pa&s;&s;age home to <HI>France.</HI> It is evident from what has been mentioned, how much the Shipping, Trade and Maritime Power of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> mu&s;t be increa&s;ed by the Ad|vantages ari&s;ing to her from her Colonies in <HI>North-America:</HI> And on the other Hand, how much her Power would be dimini&s;hed, and that of <HI>France</HI> aggrandized, if &s;he &s;hould ever happen to lo&s;e them to the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervation therefore, which has been made by &s;ome, That <HI>England</HI> main|tained her Power and Sovereignty at Sea before &s;he was augmented with her Colo|nies, and therefore may as well &s;upport it now without them, is ill-founded.

<PB N="45" REF="007389_0056_102B8EC8CD3FD0B0"><HI>Great Britain,</HI> tho' much weakened by the Lo&s;s of her Colonies, might &s;till (&s;uppo&s;ing the Marine of <HI>France</HI> to be as much inferior in all other Re&s;pects to that of <HI>Great-Bri|tain,</HI> as it was before the two Crowns ac|quired their re&s;pective Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in <HI>North|America</HI>) &s;upport her Power at Sea in the &s;ame State &s;he did before the Acqui&s;ition of them.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS concerning the Increa&s;e of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. TAbles of the Proportion of Marriages to Births, of Deaths to Births, of Marriages to the Numbers of Inhabitants, &amp;c. form'd on Ob&s;ervaions made upon the Bills of Mortality, Chri&s;tnings, &amp;c. of populous Cities, will not &s;uit Countries; nor will Tables form'd on Ob&s;ervations made on full &s;ettled old Countries, as <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;uit new Countries, as <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. For People increa&s;e in Proportion to the Number of Marriages, and that is greater in Proportion to the Ea&s;e and Con|venience of &s;upporting a Family. When Families can be ea&s;ily &s;upported, more Per&s;ons marry, and earlier in Life.</P>
<P N="3">3. In Cities, where all Trades, Occu|pations and Offices are full, many delay marrying, till they can &s;ee how to bear the Charges of a Family; which Charges
<PB N="2" REF="007389_0060_102B8ED0F391CC28">are greater in Cities, as Luxury is more common: many live &s;ingle during Life, and continue Servants to Families, Jour|neymen to Trades &amp;c. hence Cities do not by natural Generation &s;upply them&s;elves with Inhabitants; the Deaths are more than the Births.</P>
<P N="4">4. In Countries full &s;ettled, the Ca&s;e mu&s;t be nearly the &s;ame; all Lands being occupied and improved to the Heighth; tho&s;e who cannot get Land, mu&s;t Labour for others that have it; when Labourers are plenty, their Wages will be low; by low Wages a Family is &s;upported with Difficulty; this Difficulty deters many from Marriage, who therefore long continue Servants and &s;ingle.&mdash;Only as the Cities take Supplies of People from the Country, and thereby make a little more Room in the Country; Marriage is a little more in|courag'd there, and the Births exceed the Deaths.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Europe</HI> is generally full &s;ettled with Hu&s;bandmen, Manufacturers, &amp;c. and therefore cannot now much increa&s;e in People: <HI>America</HI> is chiefly occupied by Indians, who &s;ub&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly by Hunting.&mdash; But as the Hunter, of all Men, requires the greate&s;t Quantity of Land from whence to draw his Sub&s;i&s;tence, (the Hu&s;bandman
<PB N="3" REF="007389_0061_102B8ED2805743D8">&s;ub&s;i&s;ting on much le&s;s, the Gardner on &s;till le&s;s, and the Manufacturer requiring lea&s;t of all), The <HI>Europeans</HI> found <HI>America</HI> fully &s;ettled as it well could be by Hunters; yet the&s;e having large Tracks, were ea&s;ily prevail'd on to part with Portions of Territory to the new Comers, who did not much interfere with the Natives in Hunting, and furni&s;h'd them with many Things they wanted.</P>
<P N="6">6. Land being thus plenty in <HI>America,</HI> and &s;o cheap as that a labouring Man, that under&s;tands Hu&s;bandry, can in a &s;hort Time &s;ave Money enough to purcha&s;e a Piece of new Land &s;ufficient for a Plantati|on, whereon he may &s;ub&s;i&s;t a Family; &s;uch are not afraid to marry; for if they even look far enough forward to con&s;ider how their Children when grown up are to be provided for, they &s;ee that more Land is to be had at Rates equally ea&s;y, all Circum&s;tances con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hence Marriages in <HI>America</HI> are more general, and more generally early, than in <HI>Europe.</HI> And if it is reckoned there, that there is but one Marriage per Annum a|mong 100 Per&s;ons, perhaps we may here reckon two; and if in <HI>Europe</HI> they have but 4 Births to a Marriage (many of their Marriages being late) we may here reckon
<PB N="4" REF="007389_0062_102B8ED46247C1C0">8, of which if one half grow up, and our Marriages are made, reckoning one with another at 20 Years of Age, our People mu&s;t at lea&s;t be doubled every 20 Years.</P>
<P N="8">8. But notwith&s;tanding this Increa&s;e, &s;o va&s;t is the Territory of <HI>North-America,</HI> that it will require many Ages to &s;ettle it fully; and till it is fully &s;ettled, Labour will never be cheap here, where no Man continues long a Labourer for others, but gets a Plan|tation of his own, no Man continues long a Journeyman to a Trade, but goes among tho&s;e new Settlers, and &s;ets up for him&s;elf, &amp;c. Hence Labour is no cheaper now, in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> than it was 30 Years ago, tho' &s;o many Thou&s;and labouring People have been imported.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Danger therefore of the&s;e Colo|nies interfering with their Mother Country in Trades that depend on Labour, Manu|factures, &amp;c. is too remote to require the Attention of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. But in Proportion to the Increa&s;e of the Colonies, a va&s;t Demand is growing for Briti&s;h Manufactures, a glorious Market wholly in the Power of <HI>Britain,</HI> in which Foreigners cannot interfere, which will in|crea&s;e in a &s;hort Time even beyond her Power of &s;upplying, tho' her whole Trade &s;hould be to her Colonies: Therefore <HI>Britain</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="007389_0063_102B8ED5F4BC3A98">&s;hould not too much re&s;train Manufactures in her Colonies. A wife and good Mother will not do it. To di&s;tre&s;s, is to weaken, and weakening the Children, weakens the whole Family.</P>
<P N="11">11. Be&s;ides if the Manufactures of <HI>Britain</HI> (by Rea&s;on of the <HI>American</HI> Demands) &s;hould ri&s;e too high in Price, Foreigners who can &s;ell cheaper will drive her Mer|chants out of Foreign Markets; Foreign Manufactures will thereby be encouraged and increa&s;ed, and con&s;equently foreign Nations, perhaps her Rivals in Power, grow more populous and more powerful; while her own Colonies, kept too low, are unable to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, or add to her Strength.</P>
<P N="12">12. Tis an ill-grounded Opinion that by the Labour of Slaves, <HI>America</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly vie in Cheapne&s;s of Manufactures with <HI>Britain.</HI> The Labour of Slaves can never be &s;o cheap here as the Labour of working Men is in <HI>Britain.</HI> Any one may compute it. Intere&s;t of Money is in the Co|lonies from 6 to 10 per Cent. Slaves one with another co&s;t 30 &pound;. Sterling per Head. Reckon then the Intere&s;t of the fir&s;t Purcha&s;e of a Slave, the In&s;urance or Ri&s;que on his Life, his Cloathing and Diet, Expences in his Sickne&s;s and Lo&s;s of Time, Lo&s;s by his Neglect of Bu&s;ine&s;s (Neglect is natural to
<PB N="6" REF="007389_0064_102B8ED82C5DCDA8">the Man who is not to be benefited by his own Care or Diligence), Expence of a Driver to keep him at Work, and his Pil|fering from Time to Time, almo&s;t every Slave being <HI>by Nature</HI> a Thief, and com|pare the whole Amount with the Wages of a Manufacturer of Iron or Wool in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> you will &s;ee that Labour is much chea|per there than it ever can be by Negroes here. Why then will <HI>Americans</HI> purcha&s;e Slaves? Becau&s;e Slaves may be kept as long as a Man plea&s;es, or has Occa&s;ion for their Labour; while hired Men are continually leaving their Ma&s;ter (often in the mid&s;t of his Bu&s;ine&s;s,) and &s;etting up for them&s;elves. &sect;. 8.</P>
<P N="13">13. As the Increa&s;e of People depends on the Encouragement of Marriages, the fol|lowing Things mu&s;tdimini&s;h a Nation, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. The being conquered; for the Con|querors will engro&s;s as many Offices, and exact as much Tribute or Profit on the La|bour of the conquered, as will maintain them in their new E&s;tabli&s;hment, and this dimini&s;hing the Sub&s;i&s;tence of the Natives di&s;courages their Marriages, &amp; &s;o gradually dimini&s;hes them, while the Foreigners increa&s;e. 2. Lo&s;s of Territory. Thus the <HI>Britons</HI> being driven into <HI>Wales,</HI> and crowded together in a barren Country in|&s;u&s;&s;icient
<PB N="7" REF="007389_0065_102B8EDA5CC70CD8">to &s;upport &s;uch great Numbers, dimini&s;hed 'till the People bore a Propor|tion to the Produce, while the <HI>Saxons</HI> increas'd on their abandoned Lands; 'till the I&s;land became full of <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> And were the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> now driven into <HI>Wales</HI> by &s;ome foreign Nation, there would in a few Years be no more Engli&s;hmen in <HI>Britain,</HI> than there are now People in <HI>Wales.</HI> 3. Lo&s;s of Trade. Manufactures exported, draw Sub&s;i&s;tence from Foreign Countries for Numbers; who are thereby enabled to marry and rai&s;e Families. If the Na|tion be deprived of any Branch of Trade, and no new Employment is found for the People occupy'd in that Branch, it will al&s;o be &s;oon deprived of &s;o many Peo|ple. 4. Lo&s;s of Food. Suppo&s;e a Nation has a Fi&s;hery, which not only employs great Numbers, but makes the Food and Sub&s;i&s;tence of the People cheaper: If a|nother Nation becomes Ma&s;ter of the Seas, and prevents the Fi&s;hery, the People will dimini&s;h in Proportion as the Lo&s;s of Em|ploy, and Dearne&s;s of Provi&s;ion, makes it more difficult to &s;ub&s;i&s;t a Family. 5. Bad Government and in&s;ecure Property. Peo|ple not only leave &s;uch a Country, and &s;ettling Abroad incorporate with other Na|tions, lo&s;e their native Language, and be|come
<PB N="8" REF="007389_0066_102B8EDC13473610">Foreigners; but the Indu&s;try of tho&s;e that remain being di&s;courag'd, the Quantity of Sub&s;i&s;tence in the Country is le&s;&s;en'd, and the Support of a Family becomes more difficult. So heavy Taxes tend to dimini&s;h a People. 6. The Introduction of Slaves. The Negroes brought into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sugar <HI>I&s;lands,</HI> have greatly dimini&s;h'd the Whites there; the Poor are by this Means depriv'd of Employment, while a few Families acquire va&s;t E&s;tates; which they &s;pend on Foreign Luxuries, and edu|cating their Children in the Habit of tho&s;e Luxuries; the &s;ame Income is needed for the Support of one that might have main|tain'd 100. The Whites who have Slaves, not labouring, are enfeebled, and there|fore not &s;o generally prolific; the Slaves being work'd too hard, and ill fed, their Con&s;titutions are broken, and the Deaths among them are more than the Births; &s;o that a continual Supply is needed from <HI>Africa.</HI> The Northern Colonies having few Slaves increa&s;e in Whites. Slaves al&s;o pejorate the Families that u&s;e them; the white Children become proud, di&s;gu&s;ted with Labour, and being educated in Idle|ne&s;s, are rendered unfit to get a Living by Indu&s;try.</P>

Hence the Prince that acquires new Territory, if he finds it vacant, or removes the Natives to give his own People Room; the Legi&s;lator that makes effectual Laws for promoting of Trade, increa&s;ing Em|ployment, improving Land by more or better Tillage; providing more Food by Fi&s;heries; &s;ecuring Property, &amp;c. and the Man that invents new Trades, Arts or Manufactures, or new Improvements in Hu&s;bandry, may be properly called <HI>Fathers</HI> of their Nation, as they are the Cau&s;e of the Generation of Multitudes, by the En|couragement they afford to Marriage.</P>

<P N="18">18. Home Luxury in the Great, in|crea&s;es the Nation's Manufacturers em|ploy'd by it, who are many, and only tends to dimini&s;h the Families that indulge in it, who are few.

<P N="19">19. The great Increa&s;e of Offspring in particular Families, is not always owing to greater Fecundity of Nature, but &s;ome|times to Examples of Indu&s;try in the Heads, and indu&s;trious Education; by which the Children are enabled to provide better for

<P N="24">24. Which leads me to add one Remark: That the Number of purely white People in the World is proportionably very &s;mall.
