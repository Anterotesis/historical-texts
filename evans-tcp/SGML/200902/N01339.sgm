<P>IN our Context, the holy Apo&s;tle blames the Chri&s;tian <HI>Corinthians,</HI> for <HI>going to Law</HI> before the <HI>Unju&s;t,</HI> v. 1. before <HI>Unbelievers,</HI> v. 6. and that about <HI>&s;malle&s;t matters,</HI> v. 2. They were very ready to <HI>Sue</HI> one ano|ther at the Law, about &s;mall matters, and that before <HI>infidels,</HI> before <HI>Heathen, Pagan Judges:</HI> This he blames them for. He does not ab&s;olutely, blame or condemn, the u&s;ing of whole&s;ome hu|mane Laws, for the defending men from Injuries, or for the obtaining of their right. The Apo&s;tle him&s;elf, when in danger of being wrongfully and illegally Scourged, pleaded the Roman Law in his own defence, &s;aying, Act. 22.25. <HI>Is it lawful for you to Scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncon|demned?</HI> Yea God him&s;elf appointed, that there
<PB N="2" REF="001590_0003_0FB3DB05D7C94778">&s;hould be Judges among his People, to hear Cau|&s;es and to &s;ee Ju&s;tice done. Deut. 25.1. <HI>If there be a Controve&s;y between men, and they come un|to Judgment that the Judges may Judge them, then they &s;hall ju&s;tifie the Righteous &amp; condemn the Wicked.</HI> Tis not therefore ab&s;olutely and in it &s;elf con&s;i|dered, a Sin, to go to Law; tho' circum&s;tances are often &s;uch, that many do very Sinfully in going to Law. And &s;uch were the circum&s;tan|ces at this time, among the <HI>Corinthians;</HI> they went to Law about little matters, and that be|fore Heathen Judges, who were ready from their contentions to vilifie &amp; reproach their Religion. The Chri&s;tian Religion does oblige the Profe&s;&s;ors of it, to be loving, quiet, peaceable, harmle&s;s, &s;elf-denying. <HI>If it be po&s;&s;ible, as much as in you lieth, live peaceably with all men,</HI> Rom. 12.18. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;aid, Joh. 13.35. <HI>By this &s;hall all men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have love one to another.</HI> Since Chri&s;tians are &s;o plainly re|quired, to be loving, peaceable, &s;elf-denying; no doubt but the heathen Judges before whom the Chri&s;tian <HI>Corinthians</HI> manag'd their contro|ver&s;ies, did thence take occa&s;ion, to reproach their <HI>Religion</HI> as well as their <HI>Per&s;ons.</HI> The A|po&s;tle therefore blames the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> becau&s;e they had no more regard to the <HI>Credit &amp; Reputa|tion</HI> of their <HI>Religion:</HI> he tells them they had bet|ter <HI>Suffer them&s;elves to be defrauded,</HI> than that their Religion &s;hould thus &s;uffer by their means, <HI>v.</HI> 7. But then the Apo&s;tle goes on, and chargeth
<PB N="3" REF="001590_0004_0FB3DB07564556F8">the&s;e Chri&s;tians, with an higher crime than their going to Law with one another; and that was, That they them&s;elves did wrong and defraud one another. They were &s;o far from being wil|ling to &s;uffer wrong, and to deny them&s;elves, for the Credit of Religion; that indeed they did wrong and defrauded, and that their Brethren. This he charges on them as a great Sin, in our Text. Per&s;ons may be &s;aid to <HI>do wrong,</HI> and to <HI>defraud,</HI> in other matters as well as in <HI>Worldly goods</HI> or <HI>Outward e&s;tate;</HI> yet this latter &s;eems to be chiefly intended in our Text, and in this &s;en&s;e I &s;hall &s;peak to it at pre&s;ent. The words may afford us this,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE, <HI>viz.</HI></HEAD>
<Q><HI>Tis a very great Sin, for Chri&s;tians to wrong and defraud one another (or indeed any Per&s;ons) in their Worldly Goods or Outward E&s;tate.</HI></Q>
<P>Doubtle&s;s all Chri&s;tians, will readily a&s;&s;ent to the truth of this Doctrine; yet po&s;&s;ibly they wont &s;o well agree, who are guilty of the crime here mention'd. I &s;hall therefore inquire,</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>When may Per&s;ons be &s;aid to wrong or de|fraud others, in their Worldly Goods or Outward E&s;tates;</HI> Or, <HI>when may they be &s;aid, to get di&s;hone&s;t gain?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> There are various ways, wherein Per|&s;ons may be &s;aid to be thus guilty. They de|fraud others, (or get di&s;hone&s;t gain.)</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001590_0005_0FB3DB08D6938A80">
<HI>1. When they Rob them of their Right.</HI> By <HI>Rob|bery,</HI> I here intend, an open forcible taking away a Per&s;on's right from him, without any pretence of Law or of giving any valuable con&s;ideration for it. Such <HI>Robberies</HI> are often committed by Land, and al&s;o on the Sea by <HI>Pyrates.</HI> Such for|cible taking away, we read of, Judg. 9.25. <HI>They robbed all that came along that way, by them.</HI> Such Robbery, is contrary to the light and law of Na|ture, and expre&s;sly forbidden in the word of God. Lev. 19.13. <HI>Thou &s;halt not defraud thy Neighbour, neither rob him.</HI> P&s;al. 62.10. <HI>Become not vain in Robbery.</HI> What's gotten by Robbery, mu&s;t needs be di&s;hone&s;t gain.</P>
<P><HI>2. When they Steal from any.</HI> By <HI>Stealing,</HI> I here mean, the taking away from Per&s;ons what they're ju&s;tly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, and that in a fly, &s;ecret man|ner, un-be-known to the Per&s;ons wronged. Thus, when Per&s;ons <HI>Secretly remove Land-marks</HI> to in|large their own borders, this is Stealing of Land, contrary to the Divine Law, <HI>Deut.</HI> 27.17. So, <HI>Pick-Pockets</HI> are guilty of Stealing; &s;o tho&s;e who <HI>in the dark,</HI> or when they think <HI>none &s;ees or ob&s;erves them,</HI> will u&s;e that advantage for taking to them|&s;elves what ju&s;tly belongs to others. This is a crime, directly contrary to the expre&s;s letter of the <HI>Eight Commandment,</HI> viz. <HI>Thou &s;halt not Steal.</HI> This Sin is greatly aggravated, when Per&s;ons take advantage for it, from <HI>Shipwrecks</HI> or <HI>burning of Hou&s;es.</HI> When by &s;uch Afflictive Providences, mens goods are thrown ha&s;tily out of doors, or
<PB N="5" REF="001590_0006_0FB3DB0A561CA8E8">lye &s;cattered on the Sea-&s;hoar (the owners not being able to &s;ecure them) others will take this advantage to Steal them; I &s;ay, when they do thus, tis a great <HI>aggravation</HI> of their Theft. They add Affliction to the Afflicted. As for direct <HI>Robbing</HI> and <HI>Stealing,</HI> they're &s;uch heinous notori|ous crimes, that an hone&s;t Heathen would abhor them. But there are many other methods, wherein Per&s;ons often do wrong, defraud, and get di&s;hone&s;t gain, as,</P>
<P><HI>3. When they Sell things at an exce&s;&s;ive rate, an un|rea&s;onable high price.</HI> There's a ju&s;t profit and gain, belonging (or due) to tho&s;e, who&s;e im|ployment 'tis to buy and &s;ell. It's no ea&s;y mat|ter exactly to &s;tate the ca&s;e, and to &s;ay, how much profit is ju&s;tly to be allow'd to the Seller. The nature of the Commodities, the trouble of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and other con&s;iderations may alter the ca&s;e very much; and render it allowable to take more profit (proportionably to the worth or price of the thing) in one ca&s;e; than in ano|ther. Many circum&s;tances &s;hould be &s;eriou&s;ly weigh'd by tho&s;e, who would approve their Con|&s;ciences to God in the&s;e matters. And tho&s;e who will &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, and con&s;ult their own Con&s;ciences, may ordinarily if they will, avoid wronging them&s;elves or others in Selling. Tis good therefore, to con&s;ult the profit of the <HI>buyer</HI> as well as of the <HI>Seller,</HI> that both may rejoyce together. 1 Cor. 10.24. <HI>Let no man &s;eek his own, but every man another's wealth.</HI> That is, we &s;hould
<PB N="6" REF="001590_0007_0FB3DB0BD6A18C70">have regard to the good and profit of others, as well as of our &s;elves. But when the Seller's prin|ciple is, to get as much as po&s;&s;ibly he can, and regards only his own profit and not the buyer's; he then acts unju&s;tly. To ask and receive an exce&s;&s;ive unrea&s;onable price for what is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, is Oppre&s;&s;ion and Extortion. And tis an <HI>Aggrava|tion</HI> of this Sin, when the <HI>Seller</HI> takes advantage for it, from the <HI>Ignorance</HI> of the <HI>buyer;</HI> Impo&s;ing on his weakne&s;s, making him believe the thing is worth much more than it is. It aggravates the crime al&s;o, when he takes advantage of the buyer's <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity;</HI> it may be he has great, urgent <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for &s;uch or &s;uch a thing, can't get it el&s;e where, and this advantage the Seller takes to ask extra|vagantly: this is aggravated wickedne&s;s. Prov. 22.22. <HI>Rob not the poor, becau&s;e he is poor; neither oppre&s;s the afflicted in the gate.</HI> Tis wrong and un|ju&s;t al&s;o, for Per&s;ons to <HI>Ingro&s;s</HI> or <HI>Monopolize</HI> com|modities (getting them all into their own hands) on purpo&s;e that they may get an <HI>unrea&s;onable high price</HI> for them; e&s;pecially if &s;uch commodities are <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for humane Life, &s;uch as <HI>Food</HI> or <HI>Raiment.</HI> Prov. 11.26. <HI>He that with-holdeth corn, the People &s;hall cur&s;e him. Corn,</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of humane Life, if therefore in time of &s;carcity, any will buy up all the Corn they can, on purpo&s;e to get an unrea&s;onable high price for it; the People will cur&s;e &s;uch an one, yea and God will cur&s;e him too. So it's an ag|gravation of the crime, when Per&s;ons ask an
<PB N="7" REF="001590_0008_0FB3DB0D5E6AD1C8">exce&s;&s;ive unrea&s;onable price, for <HI>Tools</HI> or <HI>In&s;tru|ments,</HI> which are <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for mens following their hone&s;t Callings with. Deut. 24.6. <HI>No man &s;hall take the nether or upper Mill-&s;tone to pledge, for he taketh a man's Life to pledge.</HI> Some of the Poor, did grind with <HI>Hand-mills</HI> for a living, if either of the Mill-&s;tones was taken as a <HI>Pawn</HI> or <HI>Securi|ty</HI> for a debt, or for a thing lent; thereby the man was hindred from his <HI>Calling,</HI> from working for a Livelihood: &s;uch barbarity therefore was forbidden. Indeed as for trifles, baubles, things only to plea&s;e the fancy; if an high price be ask'd for them, it's not &s;o bad as to ask high for things that are <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> But &s;urely, Chri&s;tians &s;hould make Con&s;cience of their ways, they &s;hould take heed that they dont defraud in buying or &s;elling. Lev. 25.14. <HI>If thou &s;ell ought unto thy Neighbour, or buye&s;t ought of thy Neighbour's hand; ye &s;hall not oppre&s;s one another.</HI> When the <HI>Buyer</HI> would get things at an under rate, for le&s;s than they're worth, not allowing to the <HI>Seller</HI> an hone&s;t gain or rea|&s;onable profit; this al&s;o is unju&s;t. Prov. 20.14. <HI>It is naught, it is naught, (&s;aith the buyer) but when he is gone his way, then he boa&s;teth.</HI> When the buyer, by di&s;prai&s;ing and under-valuing com|modities, gets them for le&s;s than they're worth, and then brags of his good bargain; this is un|ju&s;t, tis a wicked defrauding.</P>
<P><HI>4. When men cheat and deceive in their dealings.</HI> As men &s;ometimes ask too high a price for what they <HI>Sell,</HI> &s;o they &s;ome times defraud, by Selling
<PB N="8" REF="001590_0009_0FB3DB0ED7035F68"><HI>Wor&s;e</HI> or <HI>Le&s;s</HI> than what they pretend to. When the <HI>Seller</HI> knows his commodity to be <HI>Un&s;ound, not good,</HI> and will yet affirm it to be <HI>Good &amp; Sound,</HI> and will ask and take a full price for it as &s;uch; this is vile <HI>Cheating;</HI> tis <HI>Lying</HI> and <HI>Stealing</HI> joyn'd together. So when per&s;ons deceive in <HI>Weight</HI> or <HI>Mea&s;ure,</HI> and part with <HI>le&s;s</HI> than what they pretend to, this is wicked cheating and defraud|ing. Lev. 19.35, 36. <HI>Ye &s;hall do no Unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s in Judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in mea|&s;ure; ju&s;t ballances, ju&s;t weights, a ju&s;t ephah, and a ju&s;t him &s;hall ye have.</HI> God requir'd, that they &s;hould have <HI>ju&s;t Ballances,</HI> that is, <HI>true Soales</HI> (to Sell things by <HI>weight</HI>) not &s;uch as they could make to <HI>turn deceitfully,</HI> to &s;erve a <HI>Knavi&s;h de&s;ign. Ju&s;t weights,</HI> not <HI>two Setts</HI> of weights, <HI>heavier ones</HI> to <HI>buy</HI> with, and <HI>lighter</HI> ones to <HI>&s;ell</HI> with. A <HI>just Ephah,</HI> that was a <HI>common Mea&s;ure</HI> for <HI>dry</HI> things, is <HI>Corn,</HI> &amp;c. A <HI>ju&s;t Hin,</HI> that was a <HI>common Mea|&s;ure</HI> for <HI>Liquids,</HI> as <HI>Wine, Oyl,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e <HI>Mea&s;ures</HI> &s;hould be <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> according to the <HI>Standard,</HI> accor|ding to Law, &s;uch as Mea&s;ures of &s;uch a deno|mination, were commonly &s;uppos'd or <HI>reputed</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> So God requir'd Ju&s;tice in <HI>Meteyard;</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> things Sold by the <HI>Foot</HI> or by the <HI>Yard,</HI> by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Mea&s;ure,</HI> as tis commonly called. To de|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">e or cheat by unju&s;t Weights or Mea&s;ures, is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ctly forbidden. Deut. 25.13, 14, 15. <HI>Thou &s;halt not have in thy bag diver&s;e weights, a great and a &s;mall. Thou &s;halt not have in thine hou&s;e diver&s;e mea&s;ures, a great and a &s;mall. But thou &s;halt have
<PB N="9" REF="001590_0010_0FB3DB1056D07440">a perfect and ju&s;t weight, a perfect and ju&s;t mea&s;ure &s;halt thou have.</HI> Indeed God abominates mens deceiving in weight and mea&s;ure. Prov. 20.10. <HI>Diver&s;e weights and divers mea&s;ures, both of them are alike abomination to the Lord.</HI> Mic. 6.11. <HI>Shall I count them pure with the wicked Ballances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</HI> No, God wont count &s;uch practices to be pure; but on the other hand, <HI>a ju&s;t weight is his delight,</HI> Prov. 11.1. Chri&s;tians &s;hould be fair and hone&s;t in their dealings. <HI>That no man go beyond or defraud his bro|ther in any matter, becau&s;e that the Lord is the avenger of all &s;uch,</HI> 1 The&s;. 4.6. God <HI>Smites his hand</HI> at tho&s;e, who <HI>greedily gain by Extortion,</HI> who make <HI>di&s;hone&s;t gain,</HI> Ezek. 22.12, 13. Sometimes a per|&s;on being ju&s;tly di&s;pleas'd with a Son, or Ser|vant, will <HI>Smite his hand,</HI> Saying, Well, I'll pay you for this, I'll puni&s;h you for this. Gods <HI>Smiting his hand,</HI> &s;eems to allude to &s;uch a practice among men, as if God &s;hould &s;ay, You that are &s;o gree|dy of di&s;hone&s;t gain, that cheat, extort, oppre&s;s for the getting of it, <HI>I'll pay you, I'll &s;urely puni&s;h you for &s;uch your wickedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>5. When Per&s;ons ask an exce&s;&s;ive price, for Service expected from or performed by them.</HI> As &s;ome ask too high a price for the goods or commodities they Sell; So &s;ome ask too high a price for their <HI>Service</HI> or <HI>Labour;</HI> this al&s;o is doing wrong and defrauding. Thus, <HI>Phy&s;itians</HI> defraud, if they ask an exce&s;&s;ive reward for their <HI>Medicines</HI> or <HI>Vi&s;its.</HI> So if <HI>Attorneys, Clarks, Sheriffs, Con&s;tables,</HI> or any
<PB N="10" REF="001590_0011_0FB3DB11D6302D00">Imploy'd in any &s;uch <HI>Faculty, Office</HI> or Bu&s;ine&s;s, do ask exce&s;&s;ive Rates or Fees for what they do, therein they are fraudulent and unju&s;t. So when <HI>Trades-men</HI> or <HI>Labourers</HI> ask an exce&s;&s;ive price for their Work, therein they act unju&s;t|ly and unrighteou&s;ly. For men may be unju&s;t and unrighteous, in asking too high a price for the u&s;e of their skill in any Art or My&s;tery, or in asking too much for their Work; as in ask|ing an unrea&s;onable high price for the Goods they &s;ell. So men are unju&s;t, when being hired by the <HI>Day, Week Month or Year,</HI> they are <HI>Slothful, Lazy,</HI> and <HI>Idle away their Time.</HI> For In&s;tance, Suppo&s;e, that <HI>Four Shillings</HI> a Day, is reckoned the ju&s;t and common <HI>Wages</HI> for &s;uch or &s;uch &s;ort of Work; the Workman does not expect nor ask more; I &s;ay in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, if the Workman <HI>Idles</HI> away <HI>one quar|ter</HI> of his time, and yet asks and receives full Wages, he then wrongs his Imployers of a <HI>Shilling:</HI> he as really defrauds him of a <HI>Shil|ling,</HI> as if he Stole it out of his Pocket. The Slothful Servant, is ju&s;tly call'd <HI>Wicked.</HI> Mat. 25.26 So men <HI>Defraud,</HI> when they do their Work <HI>&s;lightily</HI> or <HI>deceitfully:</HI> Deceitful Work|man&s;hip, is often a great Cheat. It may be a man has not half the Service he might have from <HI>Shoes, Cloaths, Tools</HI> or In&s;truments to work with, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> meerly from <HI>deceitfulne&s;s in Work+man&s;hip;</HI> either in tho&s;e who <HI>prepar'd</HI> Materi|als, or in tho&s;e who <HI>wrought</HI> them up. So
<PB N="11" REF="001590_0012_0FB3DB1359B87CE8">if a man Builds an Hou&s;e, and the Work be &s;lightily and deceitfully done; &s;o that the Hou&s;e &s;peedily needs Repair, and is ready to tumble down, here's va&s;t damage to the Own|er by &s;uch deceitfulne&s;s. By &s;uch deceitful Workman&s;hip, the Buyer or Imployer often lo&s;eth, not only the Money paid for <HI>Labour,</HI> but in a great mea&s;ure the <HI>co&s;t of Materials</HI> too. But as for <HI>Ship Carpenters,</HI> if they do their Work deceitfully, they are yet more guilty; for not only the <HI>Goods</HI> but the <HI>Lives</HI> of men are hazarded, by their carele&s;sne&s;s &amp; deceit. If in Building Ve&s;&s;els they do their Work de|ceitfully, they are in a remote &s;en&s;e charge|able with <HI>Murder,</HI> becau&s;e mens Lives are en|dangered by their wicked carele&s;sne&s;s. Sure|ly the&s;e methods of Fraud and Inju&s;tice, are abominable. They are quite contrary to that Golden Rule, which requires us to do to o|thers, as we would have them do to us, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.12. and contrary to, Phil. 2.4. <HI>Look not e|very man on his own things, but every man al&s;o on the things of others.</HI> When any ask and take exce&s;&s;ive <HI>Fees</HI> or too high <HI>Wages</HI> for their <HI>Ser|vice,</HI> are <HI>Idle</HI> when they're hired for <HI>&s;uch a Time,</HI> or do their work <HI>Deceitfully;</HI> then they do wrong and defraud.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>When Per&s;ons gain by any di&s;hone&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> There are &s;ome practices unlawful in them&s;elves, by which Per&s;ons indeavour to get Money. Thus &s;ome will pretend to <HI>Tell Fortunes,</HI> to pre|dict
<PB N="12" REF="001590_0013_0FB3DB14D77B0838">future events; and al&s;o by &s;ecret unlawful arts, to <HI>di&s;cover left goods,</HI> &amp;c. Now tis all <HI>un|righteous gain,</HI> that's gotten by &s;uch wicked practi|ces as the&s;e.

Rom. 3.13. <HI>With their tongues they have u&s;ed deceit.</HI> Whereas tis part of the Good mans Character, P&s;al. 15.2. <HI>He &s;peaketh the truth in his heart.</HI> And thus men mu&s;t &s;peak the truth, if they would have their <HI>Conver&s;ation in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity,</HI> as they &s;hould, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.12. Therefore Chri&s;ti|ans &s;hould not dare, to deceive with good words and fal&s;e promi&s;es, as too many often do: tis a great &s;hame, a crying &s;candal, that many Chri|&s;tians make no more Con&s;cience of keeping their word, and fulfilling their ju&s;t promi&s;es, than they do.</P>

Thus I have &s;hew'd &s;ome In&s;tances, wherein Per&s;ons may be &s;aid to be guilty of defrauding and doing wrong. And &s;uch defrauding is a great Sin, it expo&s;eth to the Divine Di&s;plea|&s;ure. Rom. 1.18. <HI>The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s of men.</HI> 1 Cor. 6.9. <HI>The Unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>By way of USE, I'll &s;ay two Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>So far as any have defrauded and done wrong, they ought to Repent of it.</HI> When we hear any Du|ty Inculcated in Preaching, we &s;hould Examine, <HI>Have we done this Duty?</HI> So when we hear any Sin laid open and condemned, we &s;hould Ex|amine, <HI>Have we been guilty of this?</HI> And when upon Inquiry we find our &s;elves faulty, we &s;hould repent. Lam. 3.40. <HI>Let us &s;earch and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord.</HI> Nay, if we have defrauded any, we &s;hould if po&s;&s;ible make <HI>Reparation</HI> to the Injured, as well as <HI>Repent</HI> of our Sin. Penitent <HI>Zacheus</HI> did &s;o, <HI>Luk.</HI> 19.8. True <HI>Repentance</HI> will bring forth agreeable <HI>fruits;</HI> we do not truly Repent of our having wrong'd any one, unle&s;s we do what we can to right him again. <HI>He &s;hall re&s;tore that which he took vi|olently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully, gotten,</HI> Lev. 6.4.</P>

2. <HI>Let us take great care, that we dont wrong or defraud any one for the future.</HI> Let us take heed, that we dont wrong any one by Cheating, Ex|torting, by unrea&s;onably neglecting to pay our Debts, by fair words and fal&s;e promi&s;es, by neglecting to make up Accompts, or adju&s;t Matters depending, or indeed by any other me|thod what&s;oever. And that we may not wrong or defraud any in his E&s;tate, let the&s;e Directions be ob&s;erved, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us Mortifie our Coveteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Coveteou&s;|ne&s;s, or exce&s;&s;ive Love to the World, puts per|&s;ons on many methods of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. 1 Tim. 6.9, 10. <HI>They that will be Rich, fall into temptation, and a &s;nare, and into many fooli&s;h and burtful lu&s;ts, which drown men in de&s;truction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while &s;ome coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced them&s;elves through with many &s;orrows.</HI> Since love to the World is &s;o great a Sin, &s;o dangerous a &s;nare, it &s;hould be carefully &s;ubdued. <HI>Mortifie therefore your Mem|bers which are upon the earth, Fornication, Unclean|ne&s;s, Inordinate Affection, evil Concupi&s;cence, and <HI>Coveteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which is Idolatry,</HI> Col. 3.5.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us Mortifie our Pride. Pride,</HI> did put the unju&s;t Steward on <HI>Deceitful methods</HI> to advantage him&s;elf; for he was <HI>A&s;ham'd</HI> to beg, <HI>Luk.</HI> 16.3 4. Some are &s;o Proud, that they're <HI>A&s;ham'd</HI>

Some are &s;o Proud, they think they mu&s;t live &s;o as to make &s;ome figure and &s;how, mu&s;t live in &s;uch or &s;uch &s;tate or fa&s;hion; mu&s;t have fine Hou&s;es well fini&s;h'd and adorn'd, mu&s;t be richly cloath'd, and mu&s;t be an&s;werable thereto in their hou&s;e-keep|ing and entertainments; thus they de&s;ire to live, tho' their E&s;tates and Bu&s;ine&s;s can't &s;upport &s;uch an <HI>Expens;ive-way</HI> of living: and this puts them upon unrighteous methods, to &s;upport the figure they would appear in. It may be they often break their ju&s;t Promi&s;es, they can't pay their ju&s;t debts, are angry if &s;o much as ask'd to pay what they owe; Po&s;&s;ibly they live high, when tis really on the E&s;tates and at the charge of others. Let us &s;ubdue &s;uch Pride, if we would be ju&s;t. <HI>Having food and raiment, let us be there|with content,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.8.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let us avoid Intemperance, vain Company, and Idlene&s;s.</HI> The&s;e Sins tend to <HI>Poverty,</HI> and that brings temptations to unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>Le&s;t I be Poor and Steal,</HI> Prov. 30.9. <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> it &s;elf, (if Intemperance and vain Company are avoid|ed) tends to <HI>Poverty,</HI> and &s;o to make men take unju&s;t cour&s;es. When men are lazy and idle, will do little or no bu&s;ine&s;s; how can they pay their debts, or get a Maintainance for them|&s;elves

Tis a <HI>Scandalous Sin</HI> for Chri&s;tians to <HI>Live in Idlene&s;s.</HI> Tis directly contrary to the expre&s;s command of God: 1 The&s;. 4.11, 12. <HI>Study to be quiet, and to do your own bu&s;ine&s;s, and to work with your hands as we commanded you; that ye may walk hone&s;tly towards them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.</HI> Tho&s;e who live <HI>Idly,</HI> are not likely to live <HI>Hone&s;tly.</HI> Eph. 4.28. <HI>Let him that &s;tole, &s;teal no more, but rather let him labour working with his bands the thing that is good.</HI> He that wont work, is in danger of <HI>Stealing,</HI> or if he does not come directly and &s;peedily to that Sin; yet po&s;&s;ibly he breaks his Promi&s;es, lyes long in debt to the great wrong and hurt of his Credi|tors, and herein he acts wickedly and unrigh|teou&s;ly. 2 The&s;. 3.10, 11.&mdash;<HI>This we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither &s;hould he eat. For we hear that there are &s;ome which walk among you di&s;orderly, working not at all, but are bui&s;y-bodies.</HI> Tho&s;e who <HI>dont work,</HI> they <HI>walk di&s;orderly;</HI> and very often are <HI>bui&s;y-bodies,</HI> trouble&s;ome mi&s;|chievous Per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let us realize God's Eye on us, and the Future Judgment.</HI> If we duly con&s;ider'd, that God al|ways &s;ees us, and will call us to an Account for what we do, this would &s;trengthen us much a|gain&s;t ill practices. Gen. 39.9. <HI>How &s;hall I do this
