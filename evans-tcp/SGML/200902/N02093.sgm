<P>THE Occa&s;ion of the En&s;uing Dialogue it accounted for in the Introduction.</P>
<P>IT's the Fruit of a few Hours pains; being begun after Noon on <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> and fini&s;hed before Noon next Day, without One tho't of it's ever being thus Expo&s;ed to the publick view.</P>
<P>BUT &s;everal of my Friends, upon Hearing of it, were de&s;irous of having it Printed: which I the rather con&s;ented to, becau&s;e divers for who&s;e &s;ake it was drawn up, were not pre&s;ent, when it was publickly delivered, who may po&s;&s;ibly take the pains to read it.</P>
<P>I de&s;ign'd to have poli&s;h'd it as well as I cou'd before I let it appear abroad; and (having other Bu&s;ine&s;s in hand) I de&s;erv'd the Tran&s;cribing it, one Week after another, hoping for a more Con|venient &s;ea&s;on &s;till, to &s;ee about it.

<P>IF it may, <HI>by GOD's Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> be Effectual, to &s;atisfy any piou&s;ly Di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons, (or &s;top the Mouths of hold gain&s;ayers) in the dark, about Singing by Note; &s;o that, This Excellent, <HI>Good Old Way</HI> of Singing, may be more promoted and practic'd in the Country, I've gained my Point.

(1) It's &s;aid to be a <HI>Comrivance</HI> to get <HI>Money.</HI> (2) They &s;pend <HI>too much time</HI> about learning; they tarry out a Nights Di&s;orderly, and Family-Religion is neglected by the means.

<P>As for this Objection, <HI>N.</HI> you may &s;ee it &s;olidly an&s;wer'd in a little <HI>Treati&s;e,</HI> Entitul'd, <HI>The Rea&s;onablene&s;s of Singing by Note;</HI> which Book was well approv'd of by very good judges of Books. I advi&s;e you, if you can, to get that Treati&s;e, and read it, with humble Supplication to the <HI>Father of Lights,</HI> that He wou'd open your Eyes to &s;ee the Truth there held forth unto you: And if you can't otherwi&s;e procure it, I'll furni&s;h you with it. &mdash; Now be&s;ides that you find it
<PB N="14" REF="002481_0017_0FDB63AD8AE0ED68">there truly a&s;&s;erted, That this you call a <HI>New Way,</HI> was &s;tudy'd, known and approv'd of in our <HI>Col|lege,</HI> from the very <HI>Foundation</HI> of it; <HI>(and tho' for &s;ome Years of later time it was unhappily neglected, yet (ble&s;&s;ed be God) it is again reviven, &amp; hope will be ever continued in that School of the Pro|phets.</HI>) And be&s;ides, that it is <HI>there</HI> ob&s;erv'd that the <HI>Notes</HI> of the Tunes were plac'd in our <HI>New-England P&s;alm Books</HI> from the <HI>Beginning,</HI> with general <HI>Directions</HI> for Singing by <HI>Note;</HI> and that there are many of the <HI>Children,</HI> and <HI>Grand-Chil|dren</HI> of the fir&s;t Setlers of <HI>New-England,</HI> who are now living, that well <HI>remember</HI> their <HI>ence&s;ters</HI> Singing by <HI>Note;</HI> I &s;ay, be&s;ides all this, It's evi|dent, that Singing by Note is no Novelty, &s;ince
<Q>Mu&s;ick is one of the <HI>Liberal Sciences,</HI> (or, (as <HI>Alsted</HI> terms it) a Mathematical Science &s;ubal|ternate to Arithmetick,</Q> and may be call'd a &s;pe|cial Arithmetick,) has been &s;o accounted in all Ages, and among&s;t all learned Nations; and was doubtle&s;s Coaeval to, if not more ancient than In|&s;trumental Mu&s;ick; of which <HI>Jubal</HI> was the <HI>In|venter,</HI> as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> tell us, <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.21.</P>
<P><HI>Moreover,</HI> the very Tunes prick'd in <HI>our P&s;alm Books,</HI> are with little or no variation in Mr. <HI>Ra|ven&s;ere&s;ts</HI> P&s;alm-Book, printed above a <HI>Hundred</HI> Years ago; in One of which, there's an account of the Gentlemens Names, that made our Tunes.</P>
<P><HI>Furthermore,</HI> (as is evident from a P&s;alm-Book of Elder <HI>Chipman</HI>'s, now in my hands) The Church of <HI>Plymouth</HI> (which was the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Church in <HI>New-England</HI>) made u&s;e of <HI>Ain&s;worth</HI>'s ver&s;ion of the

<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="marg">Magnal. <HI>B.</HI> 3 <HI>p.</HI> 100.</NOTE> about the Year 1640; yet that Church did not u&s;e it, it &s;eems, till about Two &amp; Fifty Years after, but &s;tuck to <HI>Ain&s;worth;</HI> and till about 1682. their <HI>excellent</HI> Cu&s;tom was to Sing <HI>without</HI> Reading the Line. Now, in <HI>Ain&s;worths</HI> P&s;alm-book, there are about 44 Tunes, and but 4 of them that I ever &s;aw (to my knowledge) any where, &s;ave in <HI>that</HI> P&s;alm-book: And there the Tune is pricked as in <HI>Raven&s;cro&s;is</HI> &amp; <HI>Playford</HI>'s at the beginning of the P&s;alm, or you there find a <HI>Reference</HI> to the Tune the P&s;alm is to be &s;ung in, &s;o that all the <HI>Chief Ma&s;ician</HI> or <HI>Chori&s;ter</HI> had to do, was to give the <HI>Pitch</HI> and lead the Tune, and all were to &s;ing according to the Notes in the P&s;alm Book.</P>
<P><HI>Briefly,</HI> all that know any thing to purpo&s;e a|bout Singing by Note, know as certainly, as they can any thing, that what is now call'd the <HI>U&s;ual Way,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to Singing by Note, is but a <HI>Defective Imitation</HI> of the Regular Way. And in &s;ome Places, they've kept nearer to the Rule, and in others, they've varied more from it. And wherever they differ any thing con&s;iderable, their Singing, as to the external part of it, is &s;o far Defective and Irregular. And,</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> Singing Skilfully or by Note is expre&s;s|ly &amp; by ju&s;t con&s;equence requir'd in the <HI>Word of GOD;</HI> as in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 33, 3. &amp; 47.7. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.22. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.31. <HI>Mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> 1.14. with the Third Command,

<P><PB N="18" REF="002481_0021_0FDB63B8552BAD80">
<HI>M.</HI> As to this Objection al&s;o; you may find it &s;ufficiently an&s;wer'd in the Book I before re|fer'd to. And not to enlarge here, I'll hone&s;tly confe&s;s to you that before I was pretty well ac|quainted with the Rules of Singing, I rather <HI>fan|cy'd</HI> the <HI>U&s;ual,</HI> than the Regular way: But my <HI>Judgment</HI> &s;atisfy'd me the Regular mu&s;t be be&s;t. And I know, one rea&s;on why my Fancy for the pre&s;ent was mo&s;t gratify'd with my &s;inging the U&s;ual way, was, becau&s;e I was u&s;ed to <HI>that,</HI> and not Ma&s;ter of <HI>the other.</HI> And hence it is, that <HI>Home is Home, be it never &s;o Homely.</HI> And even &s;o the mi&s;erable <HI>Hottentots</HI> (pardon the Compari&s;on!) who think to adorn them&s;elves with the <HI>Gats of Bea&s;ts,</HI> with all the Garbage in them; prefer the&s;e Guts to a <HI>Chain of Gold,</HI> becau&s;e it's what they'r u&s;ed to, and it plea&s;es their Fancies.

<P><HI>Furthermore.</HI> I've &s;aid to &s;ome of my Hearers, that if any of you <HI>A. R.
