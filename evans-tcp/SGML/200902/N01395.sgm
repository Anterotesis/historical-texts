<P>De&s;truction from God was a Terrour to me.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the foregoing Ver&s;es <HI>Job</HI> makes a &s;olemn Prote&s;tation of his Innocency: And Ver. 22. utters a terrible Impre|cation again&s;t him&s;elf in ca&s;e he was guilty. <HI>Then let mine Arm fall from my Shoul|der-blade, and mine Arm be broken from the Bone.</HI> And in this Ver&s;e he gives the rea|&s;on

why he did not carry him&s;elf Wick|edly. <HI>De&s;truction from God was a Terrour to me.</HI></P>
<P>In the Words mind, 1. How <HI>Job</HI> was affected. <HI>Terrour</HI> notes <HI>great Fear:</HI> De&s;tru|ction from God was Terrible to him. 2. With what he was affected. <HI>De&s;truction from God:</HI> Heb. <HI>of God.</HI> The Genitive Ca&s;e noting the <HI>Efficient,</HI> not the <HI>Subject.</HI></P>
<P>Q. <HI>How came</HI> Job <HI>to be afraid of De&s;tru|ction from God, &s;eeing he was not only a good Man, but, as appears by many Pa&s;&s;ages of this Book, had the a&s;&s;urance of his Salvation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A. There be Temporal De&s;tructions that good Men are in danger of.</HI> The De&s;truction of their <HI>E&s;tates,</HI> of their <HI>Children,</HI> and of their <HI>Lives.</HI> If they carry it Rebelliou&s;ly, they have no &s;ecurity that &s;uch De&s;truction &s;hall not come upon them. 2. Godly Men have rea&s;on to be afraid of Hell. Only here di&s;|tingui&s;h there is a <HI>Slavi&s;h fear</HI> of Hell, ri&s;ing from a &s;ence that Men are in a &s;tate of Condemnation. Thus they &s;hould not fear Hell. And there is a <HI>Cautious fear</HI> of Hell: <HI>That</HI> makes them to avoid tho&s;e Paths that lead to Hell. <HI>This</HI> ought to be in godly Men, that conditional Propo&s;ition is true of godly Men. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.13. <HI>If you live after the
<PB N="5" REF="001651_0004_0FB4D574C4FC0BF8">
Fle&s;h, you &s;hall die.</HI> And therefore godly Men &s;hould have an Awful fear of Hell, and a due care to avoid it. Mat. 10.28. <HI>Fear Him that can ca&s;t both Soul and Body into Hell:</HI> It is a laudable Thing for godly Men to fear Hell.</P>
<P>Doctr. <HI>The fear of Hell is a powerful Re|&s;traint from Sin.</HI> There are &s;uch &s;trong In|clinations in Men to Sin, and &s;o many Temptations, that the World would be more wicked than the old World, were there not &s;omething that had con&s;iderable power to re&s;train Men, and a principal Thing to re&s;train Men is the <HI>fear of Hell.</HI> There be &s;everal other Things that are of u&s;e to re&s;train Men, as the fear of the di&s;|plea&s;ure of <HI>Parents,</HI> of the <HI>ju&s;tice of Rulers,</HI> of <HI>Divine Vengeance in this World,</HI> but the fear of Hell is much more powerful than the&s;e. The mi&s;ery of many Men is, that they do not fear Hell, they are not &s;en&s;ible of the dreadfulne&s;s or danger of Damna|tion, and &s;o they take a great liberty to Sin: But if they were afraid of Hell, they would be afraid of Sin. When their Lu&s;ts were as Spurs to &s;tir them up to Sin, this fear would be as a Bridle to curb them in. Men are informed in the Scriptures of the
<PB N="6" REF="001651_0005_0FB4D57D0523DB60">
Mi&s;eries of Hell on purpo&s;e to debar them from Sin; <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.29, 30. <HI>If thy right Eye offend thee pluck it out, and ca&s;t it from thee, for it is profitable for thee, that one of thy Members &s;hould Peri&s;h, and not that thy whole Body &s;hould be ca&s;t into Hell.</HI> And if Men be throughly afraid of Hell, it will have that effect upon them, to re&s;train them from Sin.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How is the fear of Hell a powerful Re|&s;traint?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A. The fear of Hell di&s;covers the dangerous Nature of Sin.</HI> Hell is threatned in the Scripture as the puni&s;hment of Sin; Mat. 13.41, 42. <HI>They &s;hall gather out of his King|dom all things that offend, and them that do Iniquity, and ca&s;t them into a Furnace of Fire.</HI> Sinful carriages bring De&s;truction; hence the Man is afraid of Sin, as that which will &s;ink him into Hell. Men are afraid of Poy|&s;on and the Plague, becau&s;e they think they will kill them; &s;o they dread Sin, as that which will de&s;troy them: Though they love it, yet they dare not practi&s;e it, be|cau&s;e of the doleful Con&s;equence of it. They &s;ay they &s;hall bring a Cur&s;e upon them&s;elves: They &s;ee Death in it; hereby they &s;ee an unan&s;werable Argument again&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="001651_0006_0FB4D58103451CC8">
Sin. A Man &s;aith as he, <HI>If I &s;hould Sin, I &s;hould work fal&s;hood again&s;t my own Life.</HI> 2. Sam. 18.13, This makes the Temptations to Sin to loo&s;e their Power. Men are urged to Sin for their Profit; but they &s;ay, what Profit &s;hall I have if I be Damned? Math. 16.26. <HI>What is a Man profited if he gain the whole World and loo&s;e his own Soul?</HI> They are urged to Sin for their Plea&s;ure; but they &s;ay, we &s;hall have Pain in&s;tead of Plea&s;ure. <HI>Prov.</HI> 5.4, 5. <HI>Her end is bitter as Wormwood, &s;harp as a two-edged Sword. Her Feet go down to Death, her &s;teps take hold of Hell.</HI> They are urged to Sin for their Ho|nour; but they &s;ay, This is the way to bring our &s;elves to Shame. Dan. 12.2. <HI>Some &s;hall ri&s;e to Shame and everla&s;ting Contempt.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The fear of Hell helps Men to &s;ee &s;ome|what of the ba&s;ene&s;s of Sin.</HI> When Men are afraid of Hell, they are thereby made &s;en|&s;ible of the terrible Anger of God for Sin; and may rationally conclude that Sin is an exceeding great Evil. If it were not, God would not be &s;o angry as to &s;end Men to Hell on that account. Would God inflict eternal Puni&s;hment for it, if the Evil of it were not exceeding great? There is a great deal of Light in Hell-Fire, di&s;covering that
<PB N="8" REF="001651_0007_0FB4D583CFD91160">
Sin mu&s;t needs be an abominable Thing, if we &s;hould &s;ee Per&s;ons burnt at a Stake under a righteous Government, we &s;hould conclude that they had been guilty of hor|rible Crimes. So in this Ca&s;e; Be&s;ides when Men are afraid of Hell, that leads them to con&s;ider the Nature of Sin; it brings them into a ponderous frame of Spirit, and makes them to weigh Things more Judi|ciou&s;ly, and when they do &s;o, though they have only natural Con&s;cience, yet they may perceive a great deal of Filthine&s;s in evil Carriages. They can ea&s;ily di&s;cern that there is in their &s;inful Carriages a great deal of Folley, much corrupt Affection and Filthine&s;s, and ba&s;ene&s;s again&s;t the light of Nature, Natural Con&s;cience doth con|demn many Sins, Rom. 2.15.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The fear of Hell helps Men to &s;ee what Practices are Sinful.</HI> When Men are not a|fraid of Hell, many times they don't &s;u&s;|pect many of their &s;inful Practices; and if they be told that they are Evil, they &s;tand up in the Ju&s;tification of them, and have a great deal to plead for them. It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to convince them, but if the terrour of Hell take hold upon them, they will ea&s;ily fall under Conviction, that many
<PB N="9" REF="001651_0008_0FB4D61FC5B76100">
things are ami&s;s, which formerly they &s;aw no Evil in. Con&s;cience is enlightned, and they are &s;en&s;ible of their danger; <HI>Now the Word is as a &s;harp two-edged Sword,</HI> Heb. 4.12. They dare not give way to a cavil|ling Spirit as before, they con&s;ider the rule more Impartially than they did; they know that Figleaves and &s;orry Pretences and Ex|cu&s;es will not &s;erve their turn when God &s;hall judge them, and they condemn &s;uch things as they ju&s;tified before.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>USE. See the Rea&s;on why there is &s;o little Reformation in this Land.</HI> This Work of Re|formation has been mightily clogged, and a very little Matter has been effected; the Countrey hath been pro&s;perous in other De&s;igns: There hath been an indeavour to promote Cloathing, and it hath been pro&s;|pered; &s;o there has been a de&s;ign to pro|mote Learning and Merchandize, and there hath been Succe&s;s; but there have been great endeavours to promote Reformation; Laws have been enacted, Sermons have been preached, Covenants have been made, but all endeavours have had a mi&s;carrying Womb; there has not been one Sin gene|rally reformed the&s;e twenty Years. In&s;tead of growing better and better, the Country
<PB N="10" REF="001651_0009_0FB4D622F59BFBD8">
grows wor&s;e and wor&s;e. Many &s;eem to be Incorrigible and Ob&s;tinate in their Pride and Luxury and Profane&s;s: The rea&s;on of it is, they are not afraid of Hell; they are afraid of Poverty, and afraid of Sickne&s;s, but not afraid of Hell; that would re&s;train them from &s;inful Practices, De&s;truction from God would be a Terrour to them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fear of Puni&s;hment from Men, will not make the Land Reform.</HI> The fear of Man is of con&s;iderable U&s;e: Were it not for this, the World would be far more wick|ed than it is: They that don't love Vertue, fear Puni&s;hment: Rulers are a <HI>Terrour to Evil doers,</HI> Rom. 13.4. The benefit of Go|vernment in this re&s;pect is very great, but will not make the Land Reform, for a|bundance of the Sins that bring down the Wrath of God upon the Land, don't fall under the Cognizance of Authority. There is a great deal of Pride and Murmuring and Worldline&s;s, and prophaning of the Sabbath, that is not puni&s;hable by Law. The Laws of Men reach more gro&s;s In|iquities; but there are many Tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|ons that are breaches of the Laws of Men. Parents may fail extreamly of their Duty, &s;o may Officers in the Church and Com|monwealth,
<PB N="11" REF="001651_0010_0FB4D624482E2590">
yet no Law take hold of them; there may be abundance of Iniquity found by God among a People, who are yet In|nocent in the eye of the Law.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Experience of publick Judgments will not make them to Reform.</HI> Publick Judgments are monitors of Obedience; God &s;peaks audibly and &s;en&s;ibly in them; and &s;ome|times they have an Efficacy on the Con|&s;ciences of Men. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78.34, 35. <HI>When He &s;lew them, then they &s;ought Him,</HI> &amp;c. But many times the Phy&s;ick is not &s;trong enough for the Di&s;ea&s;e: Judgments de&s;troy their outward Comforts, but don't de&s;troy their Sins. <HI>Cleanne&s;s of Teeth won't clean&s;e away their Sins.</HI> Am. 4.6. The Barrenne&s;s of the Land won't make them Fruitful, <HI>V.</HI> 9. The Pe&s;tilence won't cure the Plague of their Hearts, <HI>V.</HI> 10. When they were &s;corched with Fire from Heaven, their Con&s;ciences were &s;eared, <HI>V.</HI> 11. <HI>Ten Plagues</HI> were not &s;ufficient to work upon <HI>Pharoah.</HI> Judgments won't deliver a People from their hard Hearts. Jer. 5.3. <HI>Thou ha&s;t &s;tricken them, but they have refu&s;ed to receive In&s;tructions; they have made their Faces harder than a Rock, they have refu&s;ed to Return.</HI> Sometimes Judg|ments make People wor&s;e; many times
<PB N="12" REF="001651_0011_0FB4D625C5F8D2E8">
Men are not convinced what Judgments come for, and when they are pa&s;t, they are &s;oon forgotten: Men had rather bear a pretty deal than part with their Sins.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Fear of Shame among Men will not make them Reform.</HI> Sinful Carriages are a Shame to Men. When Men Sin, they degrade them&s;elves, and act beneath the dignity of their Nature. Sin is unrea&s;onable, and &s;hews a ba&s;ene&s;s of Spirit; it brings <HI>a Reproach up|on a People,</HI> Prov. 14.34. And hence &s;ome particular Per&s;ons are affected with it, and &s;corn to make them&s;elves a Reproach. They are not willing to be as the Fools in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;o avoid tho&s;e Sins that bring Ignominy. But when a People are become Corrupt, many &s;inful Practices are not counted Shameful. Many things that are Provocations to God are vindicated; the commonne&s;s of a Practice makes it to be accounted Lawful. Men may practi&s;e things that are provoking to God, yet live in Reputation among Men; they may be ac|counted Saints, they may be advanced to places of Honour, yea &s;ometimes among a corrupt People, that which is indeed a Shame, is counted an Honour, and they glory therein. Phil. 3.19. <HI>Who&s;e Glory is in their Shame.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="13" REF="001651_0012_0FB4D62746031FA0">4. <HI>Sen&s;e of Mercies and Deliverances will not.</HI> A corrupt People are wont to have much Mercy mingled with Judgment, and &s;ometimes God gives great Deliverances to them: The&s;e things &s;hould lead Men to Repentance, and &s;ometimes they are much affected with the goodne&s;s of God. God's Mercies melt their Hearts, and they promi&s;e to amend their Ways; but &s;uch things &s;eldom make a People Reform. Af|ter a while the Pang is over, and they for|get the goodne&s;s of God. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 106.12, 13. <HI>They &s;ang his Prai&s;e, but &s;oon forgot his Works.</HI> V. 21. <HI>They forgot God their Saviour, that had done great things for them.</HI> The thoughts of the Deliverance grow a &s;tale thing after a while, and they loo&s;e the &s;en&s;e of God's Mercies; yea the Mercies that God be|&s;tows upon them prove a Snare to them. If God be&s;tows Plenty on them, they grow more Coveteous, and the more they have the more they crave; he that loveth Silver will not be &s;atisfied with Silver, and they &s;well with Pride, and forget their depen|dance upon God, and think much to be controuled. <HI>Prov.</HI> 30.9. <HI>Le&s;t I be full and deny thee, and &s;ay, Who is the Lord?</HI> And many times they grow Voluptuous, and
<PB N="14" REF="001651_0013_0FB4D62985CA6FE8">
live the lives of <HI>Epicures.</HI> Am. 6.4, 5, 6. <HI>They lie upon Beds of Ivory, and &s;tretch them|&s;elves upon their Couches, they eat the Lambs out of the Flock, and Calves out of the mid&s;t of the Stall; they chant to the Sound of the Viol, and invent to them&s;elves In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick, like David; they drink Wine in Bowls, and Anoint them&s;elves with the chief Oint|ments.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We &s;ee hence, <HI>it would be a great be|nefit to many Men, if they had more of the fear of Hell.</HI> It is worthy our Ob&s;ervation, That of all the Preachers that we Read of in the Scriptures, none was &s;o frequent in warn|ing the People to avoid Hell, as JESUS CHRIST; He was often telling them of their Danger, and per&s;wading them, if it were po&s;&s;ible, to avoid Damnation. Some|times He tells them, That <HI>the Chaffe &s;hall be burnt up with unquenchable Fire;</HI> Sometimes that it is better to enter into Life with one Eye, man <HI>having two Eyes to be ca&s;t into Hell-Fire:</HI> Sometimes of their being ca&s;t into a <HI>Furnace of Fire, where there is Wailing and gna&s;hing of Teeth.</HI> Sometimes he asks the <HI>Scribes</HI> how they could e&s;cape <HI>the Damna|tion of Hell?</HI> Sometimes He minds His hear|ers of the Sentence that &s;hall be pronounc|ed
<PB N="15" REF="001651_0014_0FB4D62DC816B978">
on the Wicked at la&s;t, viz. <HI>Depart from me ye Cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI> From hence we may learn, That the Con&s;ideration of the Pains of Hell, is &s;ingularly U&s;eful for the promoting of Holine&s;s, and it would be greatly beneficial to carnal Men, if they had more of the fear of Hell; it would make them more Solemn, more Prayerful, more loo&s;e from worldly Enjoyments, and more cautious how they did behave them|&s;elves. And it would be a great benefit to godly Men, if they had more of the fear of Hell; it would help them again&s;t a Luke|warm and Slumbering Spirit, and &s;trength|en their Hearts again&s;t many Temptations that they are wont to be outbid by. Job 31.33. <HI>De&s;truction from God was a Terrour to me.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It would be a great benefit to Parents.</HI> One of the great Mi&s;eries of the Land is, That <HI>Children are not well educated;</HI> they are bred up to Work, but are not well in|&s;tructed: Parents don't teach them, warn them, govern them, give good Examples to them: Hence many Children are Igno|rent, and Rude, and Prophane. This Un|faithfulne&s;s brings many Parents to eternal
<PB N="16" REF="001651_0015_0FB4D62EC5CED4E8">
Ruine, and their Indulgence is the cau&s;e of the Damnation of their Children. <HI>Eli's</HI> Indulgence had an influence into the De|&s;truction of <HI>Hophni</HI> and <HI>Phineas.</HI> If Parents were more careful that they might <HI>not go to Hell them&s;elves,</HI> they would be more La|borious in teaching their Children, and in <HI>bringing them up in the Nurture and Admoni|tion of the Lord;</HI> and if they were more careful that their Children might not go to Hell, they would not connive at their Sins, and countenance them in their World|line&s;s and Pride; they would warn them more &s;olemnly, re&s;train and govern them more throughly. Prov. 23.14. <HI>Thou &s;halt beat him with the Rod, and deliver his Soul from Hell.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It would be a great benefit to Mini&s;ters.</HI> Mini&s;ters may fail of their Duty many ways, in not convincing Men of their Sins, not &s;etting &s;ufficient Light before them for their Conviction; in not bearing a due Te&s;timony again&s;t their Iniquities; in not &s;earching Men throughly whether they be in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;uffering them to deceive them&s;elves with fal&s;e Imaginations of Peace with God, by complying with the Sins of the Land, by Preaching like the <HI>Scribes</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="001651_0016_0FB4D630459F2DB0">
without Authority. But if they had a &s;en&s;e of the dreadfulne&s;s of Damnation, and a due care of their own Salvation, and the Salvation of their People, they would be more thorow in their Work. <HI>Paul</HI> urges <HI>Timothy</HI> by this Con&s;ideration: 1 Tim. 4.16. <HI>Take heed to thy &s;elf and to thy Doctrines, con|tinue in them, for in &s;o doing, thou &s;halt both &s;ave thy &s;elf, and tho&s;e that hear thee.</HI> A &s;en&s;e of the Terrour of the Lord would be a great help to them. 2 Cor. 5.11. <HI>Knowing the Terrours of the Lord, we per&s;wade Men.</HI> The &s;olemn Thoughts of this would make them careful of their Preaching, and their Example. 1 Cor. 9.27. <HI>Le&s;t by any means when I have Preached to others, I my &s;elf &s;hould be a Ca&s;t-away.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It would be a great benefit to Rulers.</HI> It is a rare thing that God is provoked with a People, but the Rulers have &s;ome Hand in it. Rulers may mi&s;s it many ways: When in their private Conver&s;ation they are not good Examples, that emboldens other Men to Tran&s;gre&s;s. They may mi&s;s it by being backward to promote Religion, when they are <HI>Gallio</HI> like, <HI>Not caring for tho&s;e things.</HI> When they don't &s;trengthen the Hands of Under-Officers, by not mak|ing
<PB N="18" REF="001651_0017_0FB4D631C7669F70">
u&s;e of their Information, &s;uffering things to drop without due Examination. They may be very Faulty by not puni&s;hing Vice duly, having an indulgent Spirit towards tho&s;e that are guilty of Mi&s;demeaners; by not &s;tating the Ca&s;e right unto the Jury, &s;peaking in favour of tho&s;e who&s;e Ca&s;e is naught, by not cutting of the occa&s;ions of Sin. Where there is much Temptation, there will be much Provocation, by being intimate with Men of vicious Conver&s;a|tion: This is a di&s;credit to them, a way to harden di&s;&s;olute Per&s;ons. It is <HI>very profita|ble for Rulers to have a cautious fear of Hell.</HI> They that Judge others mu&s;t be judged: They that &s;it upon the Bench mu&s;t &s;tand at the Bar; all acts of Judgment mu&s;t be called over again, and have a &s;econd Hear|ing. It is good for them that &s;it in Judg|ment to remember the Day, wherein they mu&s;t appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chri&s;t: It is good for them to ask that Que&s;tion, Job 31.14. <HI>What &s;hall I do when God ri&s;eth up? and when he vi&s;iteth, what &s;hall I an&s;wer him?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It would be a great benefit to Under-Officers.</HI> The Work of &s;ome Under-Officers is, To inform them&s;elves of the breaches
<PB N="19" REF="001651_0018_0FB4D6334686CAA8">
of Law, and to give Information to Rulers. They may fail of their Duty by neglecting to get Knowledge, le&s;t they &s;hould be counted Bu&s;ie-bodies; and by neglecting to give Information, either from Friend|&s;hip or from Fear, or to prevent Trouble.

<P N="6">6. <HI>It would be a great Benefit to young Per|&s;ons.</HI> Many young Per&s;ons take a licentious Liberty; &s;ome of them give way to a wan|ton Spirit; they addict them&s;elves to dal|liance, don't attend Family Orders, &s;pend the Sabbath in a Prophane way; they are devoted to their Pride, give them&s;elves up to Mirth and Jollitry, and neglect the op|portunities of Salvation. The Coun&s;els of Parents, and warnings of Teachers don't &s;ink into their Hearts; they hate to live a Moping Melancholy Life, to be con|fe&s;&s;ing their Sins, and crying to God for Pardon; but if they were <HI>afraid of Hell,</HI> that would make a mighty change in their Carriage, a &s;en&s;e of <HI>Hell-Fire</HI> would &s;oon &s;care them out of tho&s;e Humours; they would not dare to do what now they are bold to do; they would have no Heart to pro&s;ecute their carnal De&s;igns; they would

<P N="3">3 USE. <HI>Of Exhortation, to be afraid of Hell.</HI> Man is a frightful Creature, apt to be afraid of many little Evils, yet by rea&s;on of Sin, Men are &s;o hard-hearted, that they are not much afraid of Hell. Chri&s;t Je&s;us directs us to be afraid of Hell, Mat. 10.28. <HI>Fear him that can ca&s;t both Body and Soul in|to Hell.</HI> E&s;pecially tho&s;e that are in a na|tural E&s;tate, have rea&s;on to be afraid of Hell. I&s;a. 33.14. <HI>Sinners in Zion are afraid, Trembling takes hold of Hypocrites: who a|mong us can dwell with devouring Fire? who among us can dwell with everla&s;ting Burnings?</HI> Some Men are much to blame, that they put away the fear of Hell; they &s;hun and avoid it what they can, but con&s;ider &s;eri|ou&s;ly,

whether you have not abundant cau&s;e to fear Hell.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider two Things. 1. <HI>The Mi&s;eries of Hell will be exceeding great.</HI> The Mi&s;eries that have been indured by &s;ome in this World, have been amazing: It is hard to grapple with the hearing of them, and it mu&s;t be much harder to bear them; but the Mi&s;eries of Hell are far greater. Heb. 10.31. <HI>It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the living God.</HI> The Appo&s;tle &s;peaking of the Glory of Heaven, calls it, <HI>A far more Exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory,</HI> 1 Cor. 4.17. So we may &s;ay of the Mi&s;ery of Hell, it is, <HI>A far more Exceeding and Eternal weight of Mi&s;ery.</HI></P>
<P>Mind here the&s;e three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Per&s;ons will be in Di&s;tre&s;s, they re&s;t not Day nor Night;</HI> their Mi&s;ery will be overbearing to them; there will be no room for any Comforts; they will have no ea&s;e to Comfort them; they will have no hope to Comfort them; they will have no peace of Con&s;cience to Comfort them; they will wi&s;h they had not been, they will wi&s;h they could cea&s;e to be; their former Enjoyments will be no Refre&s;hment to them; their Companions in Mi&s;ery will be no Re|fre&s;hing;
<PB N="24" REF="001651_0023_0FB4D63E85D0D4A0">
they mu&s;t endure &s;utable Reven|ges for all their Rebellions, and the Con|tempt that they have ca&s;t upon God, they will be &s;tanding Monuments of the Ven|geance of Heaven. Rom. 2.8, 9. <HI>God will render Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Angui&s;h.</HI> If their Strength were the Strength of Stones, or their Fle&s;h of Bra&s;s, they could not endure their Mi&s;ery. They will have <HI>Angui&s;h of Spirit,</HI> not know what in the World to do; there will be dreadful Wail|ing, Mat. 13.42. They will lament their Sins, they will bewail the lo&s;s of Oppor|tunities; they will condemn their Folly, they will cur&s;e them&s;elves, they will wi&s;h they had never &s;een &s;uch things as now their Hearts dote upon; their cry will go up to Heaven; they will wi&s;h they had no Sen&s;es; their Hearing and Seeing and Feel|ing will be their Mi&s;ery, their Memory, their Under&s;tanding, their Con&s;cience will be their Torment; they will wi&s;h they had no Bodies, and wi&s;h they had no Souls, their <HI>Bodies and Souls will be Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The&s;e Mi&s;eries are &s;et forth by doleful Compari&s;ons.</HI> No Compari&s;on can fully &s;et forth the Mi&s;eries of Hell, becau&s;e tho&s;e Mi&s;eries do exceed all others; but &s;ome
<PB N="25" REF="001651_0024_0FB4D64329D077C0">
other Mi&s;eries may in an affecting manner repre&s;ent to us, &s;omewhat of the Mi&s;eries of Hell. Hell is compared to a <HI>Dark Dun|geon,</HI> Mat. 8.12. The Children of the Kingdom &s;hall be ca&s;t <HI>into outer Darkne&s;s.</HI> So Jud. 13. we read, <HI>That the Blackne&s;s of Darkne&s;s is re&s;erved for ungodly Men. Jere|miah</HI> the Prophet was in a &s;orrowful Con|dition, when ca&s;t into the <HI>Dungeon:</HI> It was a dark miry Hole, for <HI>he &s;unk in the Mire,</HI> Jer. 38.6. When Per&s;ons are in a Dungeon, they are confined, and have no Liberty; it is always dark and black Night, they are cut of from all plea&s;ant Enjoy|ments, they dwell in the &s;hadow of Death. A <HI>Dungeon</HI> is next to a <HI>Grave;</HI> there the Light is as Darkne&s;s. Again, it is compar|ed to <HI>Sodom,</HI> when it was <HI>all on a light Fire.</HI> Rev. 21.8. <HI>They &s;hall have their part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone, which is the &s;econd Death.</HI> The People were in a mi&s;erable Condition, when &s;treams of Fire and Brim&s;tone fell from Heaven upon their Hou&s;es, and upon their Ground, and upon their Bodies, Men, Women, Children, all like <HI>light Torches,</HI> their Bodies blazed, how did they Scream out and Roar in that Extremity? So Hell is compared to the
<PB N="26" REF="001651_0025_0FB4D644865477D8">
<HI>Valley of the Son of Hinnom,</HI> where they <HI>burnt their Children to Moleck.</HI> Hence Hell is call|ed <HI>Gehenna,</HI> the <HI>Land of Hinnom.</HI> Mat. 5.29. So it is &s;et forth by <HI>Tophet,</HI> I&s;a. 30.33. which was the &s;ame Place. There they burnt them as Sacrifices to the Devil, and made a noi&s;e with Trumpets and other In|&s;truments, that they might drown the noi&s;e of the Cryes of the poor Children, they could not bear their Roarings. Hell is wor&s;e than all the&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Whatever the Mi&s;eries in Hell be, they will be Eternal.</HI> The&s;e Mi&s;eries will never have an End: Life will have an End, this and that Kingdom will have an End; the Captivity of <HI>Babylon</HI> had an End; the Re|jection of the <HI>Jews</HI> will have an End, and the World will have an End. Mat. 25.36. <HI>The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting Puni&s;h|ment.</HI> Mar. 9.44. There the <HI>Worm dyeth not,</HI> there the <HI>Fire is not quenched.</HI> The duration of their Mi&s;ery cannot be mea&s;ured: We may mea&s;ure the breadth of the Earth, and the circuit of the Heaven, but can't mea|&s;ure Eternity. Add Thou&s;ands to Thou|&s;ands, and multiply Millions by Millions; fill Quires of Paper with Numbers, and you can't mea&s;ure Eternity: It cannot be
<PB N="27" REF="001651_0026_0FB4D64605C27CC0">
divided into Days, or Years, or Ages; make never &s;o many Parts of it, one will be Eternal: When Men have &s;uffered ne|ver &s;o long, there is an Eternity remain|ing: It don't grow &s;horter and &s;horter. This makes every part of their Mi&s;ery In|finite, their Pain will be Infinite, the Ter|rour Infinite. If Mi&s;eries End, there is an opporttunity for Comfort afterwards; but Eternity cuts off opportunities for Com|fort: Men may well &s;ay, <HI>Who can dwell with everla&s;ting Burnings?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, <HI>It is a difficult thing to e&s;cape Hell.</HI> It may be avoided, and there be a number of Men that do e&s;cape it, but they are but few. It is a difficult thing to bear Damnation, and a difficult thing to attain Salvation. God has made a way to e&s;cape, but very few will comply with it. It is very cro&s;s to Nature; it &s;uits the Glory of God, but it don't &s;uit Men's Humours. Math. 7.14. <HI>Few there be that find it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Many that take Pains to e&s;cape it do not.</HI> Many Men make attempts to e&s;cape it, but are not &s;ucce&s;sful. Men are like Pri&s;oners bound with Chains and cannot make their e&s;cape them&s;elves. Many went out of <HI>Egypt</HI> that never reached <HI>Canaan.</HI> Some that en|deavour
<PB N="28" REF="001651_0027_0FB4D64785DA2B40">
to e&s;cape, meet with Di&s;appoint|ments and Difficulties, and are di&s;courag|ed; they are &s;cared with the <HI>Anakims</HI> and high Walls, and grow Heartle&s;s. Some of them get into a wrong way, they get a dead Faith and Hope, that that will &s;erve their turn: They have &s;amewhat like Con|ver&s;ion, and take it to be Conver&s;ion; it pa&s;&s;es among Men, and they hope it will &s;tand when they appear before God. They have got a Righteou&s;ne&s;s, but it doth not exceed the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI> Some others there be, that after they have put away their Sins, and reform|ed their Lives, do return to their Vomit a|gain, and &s;ome go on &s;eeking till they are &s;urprized with Death. Death comes upon them before they have got through their Work: There is great odds in the number of them that &s;eek, and of them that find. Luk. 13.24. <HI>Many &s;eek, and are not able to enter.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Many that think they have e&s;caped it, will not.</HI> Many Men are Ignorant, Ra&s;h and Fooli&s;h, and &s;o not very capable to pa&s;s Judgment on them&s;elves; their Judgment is worth very little in an hundred other Ca&s;es: But indeed wi&s;e Men may ea&s;ily be
<PB N="29" REF="001651_0028_0FB4D64905E47410">
deceived; partly becau&s;e of the &s;imilitude that is between fal&s;e Grace and true. I have read of a Painter, that pictured <HI>Grapes</HI> &s;o exactly, that the Birds were deceived by them, and took them for real <HI>Grapes.</HI> There is indeed a great difference between true <HI>Grace</HI> and fal&s;e; but there is al&s;o &s;uch a &s;imilitude, that wi&s;e Men may be mi&s;taken. Men are frequently mi&s;taken in Silver and in Jewels, &s;o if they look upon Per&s;ons at a di&s;tance, they are ea&s;ily mi&s;taken in them; &s;o e&s;pecially when they look upon religious Actions that have been perform|ed formerly. One great thing that expo&s;es Men to judge ami&s;s is, That they are &s;ome way or other Prejudicate; partly from Pride, partly from Fear, partly from love of Ea&s;e, partly from a dependance on the Opinion of others, and many are deceived. Prov. 30.12. <HI>There is a Generation that are pure in their own Eyes, yet are not clean&s;ed from their Filthine&s;s.</HI> Rev. 3.17. <HI>Thou &s;aye&s;t thou art Rich, and increa&s;ed in Goods, and ha&s;t need of nothing, and knowe&s;t not that thou art Poor, and Mi&s;erable, and Wretched, and Blind, and Naked.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Many whom the World ble&s;&s;es, as if they would e&s;cape it, will not.</HI> Men are not com|petant
<PB N="30" REF="001651_0029_0FB4D64C06394300">
Judges of others: Men may have Foundation enough for <HI>a judgment of Cha|rity,</HI> but they have no Foundation for <HI>a judgment of Certainty.</HI> Men may be very Cen&s;orious of real Saints, as <HI>Job's</HI> Friends were; they may judge hardly of Saints, be|cau&s;e of their Infirmities, and becau&s;e of their own Prejudices. So many have the Reputation of Saints, that are not Saints. Rev. 3.1. <HI>Thou ha&s;t a Name that thou live&s;t, and art dead.</HI> Men have nothing but Exter|nal things to judge by, which are &s;epera|ble from Grace. Sometimes they take Gifts for Grace; but many have the <HI>Gift of Prayer,</HI> that have not the <HI>Spirit of Prayer.</HI> Sometimes Men take <HI>Common Grace</HI> for <HI>Special.</HI> Zeal and Affection may be in Men de&s;titute of Grace. Sometimes they take a Religious Conver&s;ation for an Holy Con|ver&s;ation: All that they judge by, are but probable Signs, and twenty Probabilities will not make a thing Certain. Probabi|lities may make a thing legally Certain, but not Infallibly &s;o. Where there be but Probabilities, there is a po&s;&s;ibility of the contrary. Many Probabilities make a thing more Probable, but they do not amount to a Demon&s;tration. Some of the wi&s;e&s;t of

<P>THIS is a Text Je&s;us Chri&s;t him|&s;elf preached upon at <HI>Nazereth,</HI> which was the Place of His Edu|cation. It is taken from I&s;ai. 61.1, 2. where there is but little Variation as to the
<PB N="33" REF="001651_0032_0FB4D65085B51710">
Words, but a great agreement as to the Intendment of them.

In the&s;e Words is a Prediction of the Spirit's com|ing upon Him.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is meant by the Spirit?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>The Third Per&s;on in the Trinity.</HI></P>
<P>God, Father, Son, and Holy-Gho&s;t are one and the &s;ame &s;piritual Sub&s;tance. But here the Third Per&s;on is under&s;tood. Some|times He is called the <HI>Spirit of the living God.</HI> 2 Cor. 3.3. Sometimes the <HI>Spirit.</HI> 1 Joh. 32. <HI>I &s;aw the Spirit de&s;cending from Heaven.</HI> Sometimes the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t.</HI> Phil. 1.19. <HI>The &s;upply of the Spirit of Chri&s;t.</HI> Sometimes the <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> Eph. 4.30. <HI>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God.</HI> Sometimes the <HI>Spirit of Grace.</HI> Heb. 10. <HI>And have done de|&s;pite to the Spirit of Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Q. <HI>Why is the Spirit &s;aid to be upon Him?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>It is all one as if the Spirit was &s;aid to be in Him.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ion we have, 2 Kin. 2.15. <HI>The Spirit of Elijah doth re&s;t on Eli&s;ha.</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="001651_0033_0FB4D653864EA790">
And I&s;ai. 11.2. <HI>The Spirit of the Lord &s;hall re&s;t upon Him.</HI> It may have a re&s;pect to the Spirit's vi&s;ible de&s;cending on Him. Math. 3.16. <HI>He &s;aw the Spirit of God de&s;cending like a Dove, and lighting upon Him.</HI></P>
<P>This is amplyfied by the Rea&s;on, <HI>Becau&s;e the Lord hath anointed me.</HI> The Prie&s;ts were &s;eperated to their Office by this Ceremony, Lev. 8.12. <HI>He poured of the anointing Oyl up|on Aaron's Head, and anointed him to &s;anctify him.</HI> So the meaning is, That God had &s;e|perated and ordained him to this Office, to Preach the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE. <HI>Mini&s;ters had need have the Spirit of the Lord upon them, in order to the reviving of Religion among his People.</HI> There are &s;ome times of Degeneracy and Declen&s;ion in the Church. Sometimes Com|monwealths are in a langui&s;hing way. Sometimes the E&s;tates of a People are un|der Decay. So, &s;ometimes Religion is in a withering Condition; but there are means that are &s;erviceable for the reviving of it: And this is one &s;pecial means, when the Mini&s;ters have the Spirit of the Lord upon them. The Spirit of the Lord mu&s;t be pour|ed out upon the People, el&s;e Religion will not revive. But when the Spirit is upon
<PB N="35" REF="001651_0034_0FB4D65587F95DD8">
Mini&s;ters, it is a very hopeful Sign. Mal. 4.5, 6. <HI>I will &s;end you Elijah the Prophet, and he &s;hall turn the Heart of the Fathers to the Children, and the Heart of the Children to their Fathers, le&s;t I come and &s;mite the Earth with a Cur&s;e.</HI> This was accompli&s;hed when God &s;ent <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> who was filled with the Holy Gho&s;t. So after the Apo&s;tles were filled with the Spirit, much was done by their Mini&s;try, for the advancing of Re|ligion.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How doth the Spirit's being upon Mi|ni&s;ters, conduce to the reviving of Religion?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>Two Ways</HI> e&s;pecially.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Spirit gives them a Zeal for God's Glory, and the Salvation of Souls.</HI> When the Spirit of God is upon them they will be much concerned for God's Glory. So it was with <HI>Elijah,</HI> 1 Kin. 19.10. <HI>I have been very Zealous for the Lord God of Ho&s;ts.</HI> They will not be indifferent whether God's Kingdom flouri&s;h or not; their Hearts will not be upon the World, but their Hearts will be engaged for God's Honour, So for the Sal|vation of Mens Souls. They will take a great deal of Care that their Hearers do not Peri&s;h. 1 Cor. 10.33. <HI>Not &s;eeking my own Profit, but the Profit of many that they
<PB N="36" REF="001651_0035_0FB4D6568580C488">
may be &s;aved.</HI> 1 Cor. 9.19, 20, 21, 22. <HI>I have made my &s;elf a Servant to all, that I may gain the more,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I am made all things to all Men, that by all means I may &s;ave &s;ome.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Hereby they are di&s;po&s;ed to Study and Preach &s;uch things as do e&s;pecially tend to the reviving of Religion.</HI> There be &s;everal o|ther Truths, that in their Sea&s;on mu&s;t be &s;tudied and Preached. Mini&s;ters mu&s;t not decline to Preach the whole Coun&s;el of God; no part of the Word of God is in Vain. But when they are zealous for God's Honour and Mens Salvation, they will &s;et them&s;elves to revive Religion; they will dwell upon tho&s;e things that do more di|rectly tend to the furtherance of Mens Sal|vation. Such things as will take with the Con&s;ciences of Men. Ecl. 12.10. <HI>The Preacher &s;ought to find out acceptable Words.</HI> They will con&s;ider the Nece&s;&s;ities of Peo|ple, and &s;trive to relieve them. So it was with <HI>Paul,</HI> Act. 20.21. <HI>Te&s;tifying both to the Jews and al&s;o to the Greeks, Repentance to|wards God, and Faith towards our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> The Corruptions of the Land will &s;tir up their Spirit. Act. 17.16. <HI>While Paul waited for them at Athens, his Spirit was &s;tirred in him, when he &s;aw the City wholly given to Idolatry.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="37" REF="001651_0036_0FB4D65807DCAA30">2. <HI>Hereby they are prepared to declare the Word of God Powerfully.</HI> The Word of God is as an Hammer, and Men mu&s;t &s;mite with Strength to make the Nail Enter, or the Rock to Break. If the Word of God be preached in a dull dead Way, it is not like to have much Efficacy.

Some think the Zeal of Rulers, and Faithfulne&s;s of Officers may put a &s;top to Sin. But how &s;hall the&s;e things be come at, if the Spirit of Reli|gion do not revive among us?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If Religion don't revive, Multitudes will Peri&s;h for ever.</HI> If Religion don't revive, how &s;hall Men get to Heaven? The Form of Godline&s;s will not bring Men to Hea|ven.

Morality will not prepare Men for Dying. Joh. 3.3. <HI>Except a Man be Born again, he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God.</HI> If <HI>Men be Converted, their Sins will be for|given.</HI> Act. 3.19.

<P N="3">3. <HI>If Religion do not revive, there will be great Judgments.</HI> We have had many &s;our Calamities Year ofter Year; and there has been a great deal of Con&s;ideration how to be delivered from the Wrath of God: And &s;omething has been done for the prevent|ing of Wrath, but yet God's Anger is not turned away, but his Hand is &s;tretched out &s;till. One Judgment is &s;carce over, before another comes. We Pray, we Fa&s;t, make Laws, and di&s;pute about Reformation, but yet we are in Affliction, and the Hand of God goes out again&s;t us: And &s;o it will, unle&s;s there be a reviving of Religion.

<P>To Preach the Go&s;pel to the Poor.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the&s;e and the following Words, is &s;et forth the Work that Chri&s;t was <HI>anointed</HI> for. Fir&s;t to <HI>Preach the Go&s;pel to the Poor.</HI> Here mind, 1. <HI>What he was to Preach;</HI> that is, the <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI> In <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> it is <HI>good Tidings.</HI> And &s;o the <HI>Greek</HI> Word &s;ignifies, &s;o our Word <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> &s;ignifies. It comes from two <HI>Saxon</HI> Words. <HI>God,</HI> that &s;ignifies <HI>Good;</HI> and <HI>Spell,</HI> that &s;ignifies a <HI>Word.</HI> There be other good Tidings, but the Go&s;pel is &s;o by way of Eminency. The Go&s;pel brings Tidings of the love of God to Men, and of a Glorious way of Reconciliation and Salvation. They are much to blame that &s;light the Go&s;pel, and reject it. They carry as if the Go&s;pel were not good Tidings. 2. <HI>To whom he was to Preach,</HI> viz. To the <HI>Poor.</HI> There be two &s;orts of Poor. 1. They that are <HI>low in the
<PB N="57" REF="001651_0056_0FB4D67FC56B9A90">
World:</HI> That are de&s;titute of Riches; and the Invitations of the Go&s;pel are &s;ent to them as well as others; and they that re|ceive it, are more generally of that &s;ort. 1 Cor. 1.28. <HI>God hath cho&s;en the ba&s;e Things of the World, and Things that are de&s;pi&s;ed.</HI> Jam. 2.5. <HI>Hath not God cho&s;en the Poor of this World, Rich in Faith, Heirs of the King|dom.</HI> And Chri&s;t Je&s;us principally preached to &s;uch. Math. 11.5. <HI>The Poor have the Go&s;pel preached unto them.</HI> 2. Tho&s;e that are <HI>Poor in Spirit;</HI> that are &s;en&s;ible that they have nothing to purcha&s;e Heaven; that are &s;en&s;ible that they have <HI>no Money nor Price</HI> for their Salvation: And they are of two &s;orts. 1. Such as <HI>are legally Poor.</HI> As they, Math. 11.28. <HI>That Labour and are heavy Laden:</HI> That are convinced of the wretch|edne&s;s of their Hearts, and that God may ju&s;tly Condemn them. 2. Such as are <HI>Evan|gelically Poor in Spirit.</HI> Such as have the Grace of Humility, and live upon the Mer|cy of God in Chri&s;t. Spoken of, Math. 5.3. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the Poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> Tho&s;e that are called <HI>Poor</HI> here, are called <HI>Meek</HI> in I&s;aiah, C. 60. V. 1. Their Hearts are meekned, either by Conviction or by Grace. I don't exclude

the Later, but it &s;eems to have a particu|lar Re&s;pect to the Former.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE. <HI>The Go&s;pel is e&s;pecially to be preached to the Poor in Spirit: They are particularly to be invited.</HI> Con&s;ider here the&s;e two Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1">1 Propo&s;ition. <HI>The Go&s;pel is to be preached to all.</HI> Though there be no expectation that all will receive it, yet it is to be preached to all. Mini&s;ters are not bound to Preach it to every one in the World, for that is impo&s;&s;ible: But they are to Preach to all as they have Opportunity. They may not de&s;ignedly hide the Go&s;pel from any. There be many Differences among Men, in re&s;pect of their E&s;tates, Age, Covenant, Intere&s;t and Sinfulne&s;s: But the Go&s;|pel is to be preached to them all. Chri&s;t did forbid his Di&s;ciples to go into the Way of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> or to enter into any City of the <HI>Samaritans.</HI> Math. 10.5. But this was a temporary Command: But now the Go&s;|pel is to be preached unto all. Mar. 16.15. <HI>Go into all the World, and Preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature.</HI> That is, every humane Creature. Act. 20.21. <HI>Te&s;tifying both to the Jews, and al&s;o to the Greeks Repentance to|wards God, and Faith towards our Lord Je&s;us
<PB N="59" REF="001651_0058_0FB4D68470BFDBC0">
Chri&s;t.</HI> Gal. 3.28. <HI>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither Bond nor Free, there is neither Male nor Female, for ye are all one in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> All are to be in&s;tructed in the Go&s;pel, and to be invited to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1 Rea&s;on. <HI>Becau&s;e the Promi&s;e is to all.</HI> There is a conditional Promi&s;e made to all that believe in Chri&s;t. There is no ex|ception of any that do believe in Chri&s;t. The Sin again&s;t the holy Gho&s;t &s;hall not be forgiven. But the conditional Promi&s;e is true of them, and no Man knows that he hath committed that Sin. The offer of the Go&s;pel is made to Men without any Exception. It is propounded in general Terms, &s;o as to comprehend all. Act. 10.13 <HI>Who&s;oever believeth on him, &s;hall have Re|mi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</HI> Men are ready to except them&s;elves, but God makes no Exceptions. Sometimes the Promi&s;e is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">pounded In|definitely. Joh. 3.36. <HI>He that believeth on the Son hath everla&s;ting Life.</HI> But &s;ometimes it is propounded Univer&s;ally; for there is no other Condition joined to this; and not only &s;o, but the Notes of Univer&s;ality are added to the Promi&s;e; as <HI>who&s;oever.</HI> Joh. 3.16. <HI>So all.</HI> Act. 13.39. And <HI>any.</HI> Rev. 3.20. And therefore it mu&s;t be preached to all.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="60" REF="001651_0059_0FB4D685C66E83D0">2 Rea&s;on. <HI>They that are not Poor in Spi|rit, may receive Benefit by the Go&s;pel.</HI> The Go&s;pel is many Ways u&s;eful to make Men Poor in Spirit. Preparation for Chri&s;t is carried on by the Law and the Go&s;pel in Conjunction. When Men hear that there is a way of Salvation by Chri&s;t, that makes them more willing to &s;ee their Danger, and not altogether &s;o oppo&s;ite to receive Conviction. It encourages them to Pray to God to &s;hew them their Mi&s;ery. When Men hear that Chri&s;t died for our Sins, that makes them &s;en&s;ible that God is very angry for Sin; that he will execute Ven|geance. This is an evidence of the Ju&s;tice and Severity of God. Men may learn from thence, that Sin is a great Offence, and mu&s;t be puni&s;hed. Luk. 23.31. <HI>If they do &s;uch things in a green Tree, what &s;hall be done in a dry?</HI> When Men hear, that <HI>God &s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son to &s;uffer for them,</HI> that di&s;covers the vile Nature of Sin, whereby Men abu&s;e a God of &s;uch Grace. P&s;al. 130.4. <HI>There is For|givene&s;s with thee, that thou maye&s;t be feared.</HI> When Men hear that Chri&s;t hath redeem|ed us from the Cur&s;e, that may convince them that their own Works can't &s;ave
<PB N="61" REF="001651_0060_0FB4D687FA2D14E8">
them. Gal. 2.21. <HI>If Righteou&s;ne&s;s come by the Law, then Chri&s;t is Dead in vain.</HI> When they hear the Command to believe in Chri&s;t, that convinces them, that though they be Civil and Religious, yet if they believe not, they are Rebellious, and in a mi&s;erable E&s;tate.</P>
<P N="3">3 Rea&s;on. <HI>Becau&s;e they that are not Poor in Spirit now, may be Poor in Spirit after|wards.</HI> If Men hear the Go&s;pel, and don't make a right U&s;e of it now, yet they will retain the Knowledge of it, and it may do them Service afterwards, though they be not &s;en&s;ible of their lo&s;t Condition now; but are Sencele&s;s, and carnally Confident, yet they may be Poor in Spirit hereafter; and then what they have heard may come to Mind, and become powerful upon their Hearts. It may be, when they have not an opportunity to hear the Go&s;pel, they will call to Mind what they have heard &s;ome Years before, and ponder on what has been preached to them formerly. It is po&s;&s;ible they may be made Poor in Spirit, when they are in Captivity among the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> or <HI>Heathens.</HI> When they have no opportu|nity to hear the Go&s;pel, or they may be made Poor in Spirit, when they lie upon
<PB N="62" REF="001651_0061_0FB4D688C8D8FBF0">
a &s;ick Bed, and cannot hear the Word preached; and then what they have for|merly heard, may work effectually on them. <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> would not hearken to the <HI>Pro|phets</HI> when they &s;pake to him. 2 Chron. 33.10. But afterwards when he was a <HI>Cap|tive in Babylon,</HI> he remembred what he had been taught, and repented. <HI>V.</HI> 12. <HI>When he was in Affliction, he be&s;ought the Lord his God, and humbled him&s;elf greatly before the God of his Fathers.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 Propo&s;ition. <HI>The Go&s;pel is e&s;pecally to be preached to the Poor in Spirit.</HI> It is fit that Mini&s;ters &s;hould make particular Applica|tion of the calls of the Go&s;pel to them. It is true, they may do &s;o to young Men, to ancient Men and to great Sinners: But there is peculiar Rea&s;on to make particular Application to them that are <HI>Poor in Spirit.</HI> The&s;e Per&s;ons are in a particular Manner invited in the Scripture. I&s;ai. 55.1. <HI>Ho, every one that Thir&s;teth, come ye to the Wa|ters and he that hath no Money; come ye, buy and eat, buy Wine and Milk without Money, and without Price.</HI> They are Thir&s;ty that are parched up for want of &s;omewhat to quench their Thir&s;t. The like we have, Math. 11.28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that are
<PB N="63" REF="001651_0062_0FB4D68CB3D33258">
Weary and heavy Laden, and ye &s;hall find Re&s;t for your Souls.</HI> They are Weary and heavy Laden that are oppre&s;&s;ed with the weight of God's Wrath. So, Rev. 22.17. <HI>The Spirit and the Bride &s;ay, Come. And let him that is a|thir&s;t, Come: And who&s;oever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.</HI> God is here teach|ing Mini&s;ters to have a particular Regard to &s;uch. The Invitations are not confined to the&s;e, but they are to be particulary ap|plied to the&s;e. Some others have &s;pecial need to have the Terrours of the Law preached to them: But the Invitations of the Go&s;pel are e&s;pecially to be propounded to tho&s;e that are <HI>Poor in Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this, is, <HI>Not from any Excellency</HI> in this <HI>poverty of Spirit.</HI> There is nothing of Spiritual Goodne&s;s in this. It is indeed a rea&s;onable Thing; it is accor|ding to the dictates of right Rea&s;on, but there is nothing of Piety or love to God, or godly Sorrow in it. It is a meer forced Thing, and accordingly it is not accepta|ble unto God. The fir&s;t good Act that is done by the Soul, is believing in Chri&s;t: And accordingly there is no Promi&s;e made in the Scripture to this legal Poverty of Spi|rit. No Man is under any Promi&s;e of Sal|vation
<PB N="64" REF="001651_0063_0FB4D68E05DB0218">
till he comes to Chri&s;t. It is proba|ble that God may give Grace to all tho&s;e that have this Poverty of Spirit; but there is no Promi&s;e in the Word that he will. Indeed there is an incon&s;i&s;tancy in it, that there &s;hould be any Promi&s;e made to it. For when a Man is Poor in Spirit, he owns that it is in God's liberty to do with him as he plea&s;es: And he continues &s;ome|time in this Frame, and continues to ac|knowledge it. But if there were any Pro|mi&s;e of Salvation to it, then after the fir&s;t Act of Submi&s;&s;ion, it would not be in Gods liberty to do with him as he plea&s;ed; but he would be bound to be&s;tow Grace upon him, and he might challenge and lay claim to Faith,</P>
<P>But the rea&s;on is, Becau&s;e &s;uch Men are <HI>prepared</HI> to receive the Go&s;pel. This Po|verty of Spirit brings Men near to Chri&s;t; &s;o that it is very hopeful that they will ex|cept of him. The People of the <HI>Jews</HI> need|ed the Mini&s;try of <HI>John</HI> to prepare them to receive the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI> Mar. 1.2. <HI>I &s;end my Me&s;&s;enger before thy Face, to prepare thy Way before thee.</HI> So particular Souls need a Work of Preparation to make way for their accepting of Chri&s;t. So <HI>Paul</HI> was
<PB N="65" REF="001651_0064_0FB4D690D5DCF068">
prepared. Act. 9.6. He Trembling and a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;aid, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</HI> So the <HI>Jailour,</HI> Act. 16.30. He &s;aid, Sirs, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> And when Men are thrown out of their own Confidences, and made Poor in Spirit, now they are in a fair Way to receive Chri&s;t; Now they are &s;en&s;ible that Pardon and eternal Life are the free Gifts of God, and therefore Chri&s;t to prepare the Angel of the Church of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> convinces him that he was <HI>Poor, and Wretched, and Mi&s;era|ble, and Blind, and Naked.</HI> Rev. 3.17. Yet tho&s;e Men don't accept of Chri&s;t, until they have another Work of God upon the Heart. They are not fully prepared by this legal Poverty of Spirit. There needs ano|ther Work of God, further to prepare Men before they will come to Chri&s;t. If a Man were Poor in Spirit &s;even Year together, that will not prevail with him to come to Chri&s;t; but further to prepare him, his Eyes mu&s;t be opened to &s;ee the Divine Authority of the Go&s;pel. 1 The&s;. 2.13. <HI>When ye received the Word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the Word of Men, but as it is indeed the Word of God, which effectually worketh in you that believe.</HI> Until
<PB N="66" REF="001651_0065_0FB4D691CC170050">
they &s;ee the Glory of God and Chri&s;t, they will not believe. P&s;al. 9.10. <HI>They that know thy Name, will put their tru&s;t in thee.</HI> But when they are Poor in Spirit, they are prepared to receive the Go&s;pel, and give Entertainment to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Now they &s;ee a want of Salvation.</HI> Men that are &s;eeking their Felicity in the World, and have not a &s;en&s;e of the Wrath of God, don't mind Chri&s;t. They take more Notice of the Market, and worldly Opportunities, than of go&s;pel Invitations. Math. 22.5. <HI>They made light of it, and went one to his Farme, and another to his Merchan|dize.</HI> But when they are Poor in Spirit, they are like <HI>Thir&s;ty Men,</HI> that are even parched up. Rev. 22.17. <HI>Let him that is athir&s;t come.</HI> They <HI>Tremble</HI> as <HI>Paul</HI> did. Act. 9.6. This is &s;ome Preparation.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Now they &s;ee that they can get Salva|tion in no other Way.</HI> If Men have hope to Work out their Salvation them&s;elves, they will not come to Chri&s;t. If they can cure their own Souls, they will not come to this <HI>Phy&s;itian.</HI> If the Prodigal thinks that he can earn his Living, he will not return to his Father. Luk. 15.15. <HI>He went and joined him|&s;elf to a Citizen of the Country.</HI> But he that
<PB N="67" REF="001651_0066_0FB4D6964E98D4E8">
is Poor in Spirit, has tried all Conclu&s;ions, and every thing fails him. He &s;ees him&s;elf a dead Man. Rom. 7.9. <HI>Sin revived, and I died.</HI> So he &s;ees greater Nece&s;&s;ity. This is a farther degree of Preparation.</P>
<P N="1">1 USE. Hence &s;ee, <HI>That tho&s;e that are not Poor in Spirit, do e&s;pecially need to have the Law preached to them.</HI> It is u&s;eful to all &s;orts of Men to hear the Preaching of the Law. Saints &s;tand in need of it to keep them Humble, to put them upon it to re|new their Faith in Chri&s;t, and to make them Thankful: But e&s;pecially &s;uch as are not Poor in Spirit. They need to be brought to Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> and to hear the Thundrings, and &s;ee the Lightnings. Se|cure Sinners don't love to hear the Ter|rours of the Law. They had rather be en|tertained with &s;ome more comfortable Doctrine; but they are in great Nece&s;&s;ity to hear the Law. If there had been no Law, there would have been no Nece&s;&s;ity of the Go&s;pel: And Men that are not &s;en|&s;ible of the Terrours of the Law, will not regard the Invitations of the Go&s;pel. Such as are not Poor in Spirit, need to hear the Law often, that they may be prepared to receive the Go&s;pel; that their Hearts may
<PB N="68" REF="001651_0067_0FB4D698946E1E28">
be broken and humbled. Gal. 3.24. <HI>The Law was our Schoolma&s;ter, to bring us to Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That they may be &s;en&s;ible of the Terri|blene&s;s of Damnation.</HI> Many Men are not a|ware what a terrible Thing it is to be Dam|ned. They have a deeper Sen&s;e of Poverty and Reproach, than they have of Damna|tion. They look upon Hell as an uncom|fortable Place: They think if it mu&s;t be their Portion to go to Hell, they &s;hall bear it as well as others; they are not like to go thither alone: They &s;eldome think of it. They look upon it as a remote Thing at a great Di&s;tance, and it don't terrify them; but the Law di&s;covers that it is In|tollerable. P&s;al. 11.6. <HI>Upon the Wicked God will Rain Snares, Fire and Brim&s;tone, and an horrible Tempe&s;t.</HI> I&s;ai. 30.33. <HI>Tophet is pre|pared of Old, he hath made it deep and large; the Pile thereof is Fire aad much Wood; the Breath of the Lord, as a &s;tream of Brim&s;tone, doth kindle it.</HI> Math. 25.41. <HI>Depart ye Cur&s;|ed, into everla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the De|vil and his Angels.</HI> Math. 13.42. <HI>He &s;hall ca&s;t them into a Furnace of Fire, there &s;hall be Weeping and gna&s;hing of Teeth.</HI> Hence many Men are exceedingly terrified, and &s;ee a
<PB N="69" REF="001651_0068_0FB4D69A055B98E8">
nece&s;&s;ity of Deliverance. I&s;ai. 33.14. <HI>Sin|ners in Zion are afraid, Trembling has &s;ur|prized the Hypocrites: Who among us can dwell with devouring Fire? Who among us can dwell with everla&s;ting Burnings?</HI> If the &s;en&s;e of the terriblene&s;s of Damnation &s;inks into their Hearts, they won't regard the World, they won't &s;tick at their Pains; they won't think much to part with their Sins: They had rather undergo any Sorrow than be Damned.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That they may be &s;en&s;ible of the great danger of Damnation.</HI> Men are wont to &s;ooth up them&s;elves that God will not &s;end them to Hell: He is Kind, and Gracious, and they Pray to him, and they are in Cove|nant, and enjoy Priviledges: They live Orderly, and are &s;orry for their Sins, and &s;o they hope they are in no great danger. But the Law &s;hews, that Sinners are un|der a Sentence of Condemnation. Rom. 6.23. <HI>The Wages of Sin is Death.</HI> That God is very Angry with ungodly Men, P&s;al. 50.21, 22. <HI>I will Reprove thee, and &s;et thy Sins in Order before thee. Con&s;ider this, ye that forget God, le&s;t I tear you to pieces, and there be none to deliver.</HI> The Law &s;hews, that the Threatning mu&s;t be executed. The
<PB N="70" REF="001651_0069_0FB4D69C3B104128">
Law mu&s;t take Place, that the Faithfulne&s;s of God is engaged for the fulfilling of the Law. Math. 5.18. <HI>Not one jot nor tittle &s;hall pa&s;s from the Law, but all &s;hall be fulfilled.</HI> Hence many Men are afraid they &s;hall not e&s;cape. They &s;ay as Mic. 6.7. <HI>Will the Lord be plea&s;ed with Thou&s;ands of Rams, or ten Thou&s;ands of Rivers of Oyl?</HI> They are a|fraid there is no Mercy for them. They have a <HI>Fearful expectation of fiery Indignation.</HI> They have a <HI>dreadful Sound in their Ears,</HI> as Job 15.21. And their Hearts are <HI>Medi|tating Terrour.</HI> They Confe&s;s, they Reform, they Cry, they Plead, but yet it Rings in their Ears, <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that conti|nues not in all things that are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That they may be &s;en&s;ible of the danger of &s;udden De&s;truction.</HI> There is an Inclination in Men to put far away the evil Day, and then they think they may have a long Op|portunity to enjoy worldly Comforts. Men &s;ee that God exerci&s;es Patience towards o|thers, and they flatter them&s;elves that he will be Patient towards them. But by the Law, they &s;ee that God will de&s;troy ma|ny Sinners &s;uddenly. 1 The&s;. 5.3. <HI>When they &s;ay Peace and Safety, then &s;udden De|&s;truction
<PB N="71" REF="001651_0070_0FB4D69D0576E148">
cometh upon them, as Travail upon a Woman with Child, and they &s;hall not e&s;cape.</HI> And the Law &s;hews them, that God is very Angry; that he &s;ets their Iniquities before him, <HI>their &s;ecret Sins in the light of his Coun|tenance:</HI> And &s;o they are afraid God will not wait upon them. In the Evening they are afraid they &s;hall die before Morning. If they find any bodily Indi&s;po&s;ition, they are afraid they &s;hall die. If there be a Thunder-Storm, they are afraid they &s;hall be killed: Their Hearts &s;hake at the report of Sickne&s;s that prevails: They tremble at the &s;haking of a Leaf. It is with them as Deut. 28.66, 67. <HI>Thy Life &s;hall hang in &s;u|&s;pence, and thou &s;halt fear Day and Night, and &s;halt have none a&s;&s;urance of thy Life.

of God; that the Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> that they did not con&s;ent to, was imputed to them, and &s;o they were conceived in Sin, and born in Iniquity. They object, that they have done Service, and that the Pains of Hell are intolerable. But the Law &s;hews that their Damnation is ju&s;t. Rom. 3.19. <HI>What&s;oever Things the Law &s;aith, it &s;aith to them that are under the Law: That every Mouth may be &s;topped, and all the World may become Guilty before God.</HI> It is very evident from the Law, that Men have de&s;erved De&s;truction; that they are worthy of Death, for they have broken an holy Law, and according to the Sentence of it, which is a Rule of Ju&s;tice, they have merited Damnation. It is evi|dent, that they are the proper Cau&s;es of their own Sins, and they have therein run upon the point of the Sword, and have thrown them&s;elves into a Gulph of Mi|&s;ery. Ho&s;. 13.9. <HI>O I&s;rael, thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed thy &s;elf.</HI></P>

Gal. 6.3. <HI>He that thinketh him&s;elf &s;omething when he is nothing, deceiveth him|&s;elf.</HI> It is Awful for Men to &s;ee them&s;elves Poor: It is Frightful, but if you be Poor, it is be&s;t to &s;ee it. The Ca&s;e of &s;uch Men is Doleful, but not De&s;perate. Such have no Foundation to tru&s;t in them&s;elves; but they have Ground of Encouragement, for the Go&s;pel is e&s;pecially to be preached to them that are Poor in Spirit. In the Invi|tations of the Go&s;pel, he hath a &s;ingular Regard to them. Luk. 4.18. Your Condi|tion is not the more Dangerous, but the more Hopeful, for &s;eeing your &s;elves Poor.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, 1. <HI>You are wholly empty of Good|ne&s;s.</HI> Some of you have con&s;iderable &s;hews of Goodne&s;s.

Men think if they had not &s;inned &s;o much, or &s;o long, their Sin would not have been be|yond God's Mercy. But God's Mercy can Conquer all their Provocations. Grace may prevail over all. Rom. 5.21. <HI>Grace reigns through Righteou&s;nes, to eternal Life.</HI> The Mercy of God is greater than we can con|ceive of. The Under&s;tanding of Man is large: We can conceive how many Mi|nutes there be in a thou&s;and Years; how many Inches it is to the Center of the Earth, but we can't comprehend the Love of Chri&s;t Eph. 3.19. <HI>The Love of Chri&s;t pa&s;&s;eth Knowledge.</HI> We can't comprehend the Bit|terne&s;s of the Cup that he Drank for our &s;akes.

<P N="2">2. <HI>God has de&s;igned to &s;ave many lo&s;t Sin|ners.</HI> It is the purpo&s;e of his Heart, to bring many poor Sinners to heavenly Glory.

The Price of it is paid. Sin laid a Bar in the Way, but that Bar is removed by the Death of Chri&s;t. There is no need of any Contrivance how to &s;atisfy the Law, that is done already by Chri&s;t.

<P N="3">3 <HI>This is a principal Way, wherein God Glo|rifies him&s;elf.</HI> The end of all Things is God's Glory; and he hath done many great Things for his Glory. He made the World for his Glory, that his Power and Wi&s;dom might be manife&s;ted. He pre&s;erved the ho|ly Angels from Sinning, for the Glory of his Goodne&s;s. He gave the Law for the Glory of his Holine&s;s.

<PB N="81" REF="001651_0080_0FB4D6AFA33A8630">
he Gloryfies him&s;elf, in working out the Salvation of Sinners by Chri&s;t. There is a great Manife&s;tation of the <HI>Trinity of Per&s;ons</HI> in the God-head.

<P>THESE Words are an amplifica|tion of the Former; &s;hewing the Effect of Preaching the Go&s;pel to the Poor. Where 1. The Per&s;ons to be be|nefited, the <HI>Broken-hearted.</HI> The Broken-hearted, that is, tho&s;e that are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed becau&s;e of Sin. This may be either from godly Sorrow, P&s;al. 34.18. <HI>The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a Broken-heart, and &s;aveth &s;uch as be of a Contrite &s;pirit.</HI> Or, from a &s;en&s;e and apprehen&s;ion of Mi&s;ery and Danger. Prov. 15.13. <HI>By Sorrow of Heart, the Spirit is Broken.</HI> Prov. 17.22. <HI>A merry Heart doth good like a Medicine, but a broken Spirit drieth the Bones.</HI> And here it &s;eems to have a re&s;pect to tho&s;e that are in Di&s;tre&s;s of Con&s;cience. 2. The benefit
<PB N="83" REF="001651_0082_0FB4D6B205C68FB8">
he was to bring to them, healing of them. There are two Ca&s;es wherein Men &s;tand in need of Healing. One is in Ca&s;e of Sickne&s;s and Di&s;ea&s;es. P&s;al. 103.3. <HI>Who healeth all thy Di&s;ea&s;es.</HI> The other is, in Ca&s;e of Wounds. That is the Ca&s;e here. Their Con&s;ciences are wounded. In I&s;aiah it is, <HI>To bind up the broken in Heart.</HI> That is the manner of Surgeons in order to Healing.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE. <HI>There is Virtue in the Go|&s;pel to Heal wounded Con&s;ciences.</HI> As the Bo|dy of a Man, &s;o the Con&s;cience of a Man may be wounded in divers Degrees; but &s;ometimes the Wounds of Con&s;cience are very Dreadful. And it is a great Service to a Man to have tho&s;e Wounds healed. This cannot be effected by other Means. Many Men have made tryal to little Purpo&s;e, but the Go&s;pel is powerful that way. The Law Wounds the Con&s;ciences of Sinners. 1 Cor. 15.56. <HI>The Sting of Death is Sin; and the &s;trength of Sin is the Law.</HI> But the Go&s;pel Heals their Con&s;ciences. The Go&s;pel is of exceeding great U&s;e otherwi&s;e; as it &s;anctifies the Hearts, and gives Men Power over Indwelling-Sin. And this way it is very u&s;eful; that it Heals the Con&s;cience,
<PB N="84" REF="001651_0083_0FB4D6B386331CC8">
it frees the Con&s;cience from Grief, and the Terrour of Hell, and brings inward Peace and good Hope of eternal Life. Let the Wounds of Con&s;cience be never &s;o deep, yet by the Go&s;pel they may be hea|led. God is the Author of Healings. P&s;al. 147.3. <HI>He healeth the broken in Heart, and bindeth up their Wounds.</HI> But the Go&s;pel is the Means. Rom. 15.13. <HI>The God of all Hope fill you with all Peace and Joy in Believ|ing.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.8. <HI>In whom, though now you &s;ee him not, yet Believing, ye Rejoyce with Joy un&s;peakable and full of Glory.</HI> Hence the Go&s;|pel is called the Go&s;pel of Peace. Rom. 10.15. <HI>How beautiful are the Feet of them that Preach the Go&s;pel of Peace, that bring glad Tydings of good Things!</HI> Eph. 6.15. <HI>And your Feet &s;hod with the Preparation of the Go&s;pel of Peace.</HI> The Go&s;pel is a means of Peace with God, and &s;o of Peace of Con|&s;cience. Here I &s;hall Premi&s;e two Di&s;tin|ctions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Between a &s;tupifyed Con&s;cience, and an healed Con&s;cience.</HI> Some Sinners have no Angui&s;h in their Con&s;ciences. This ri&s;es from a &s;tupid and &s;encele&s;s Spirit. They are under the Power of an Athei&s;tical Prin|ciple. They have no &s;en&s;e of Eternal
<PB N="85" REF="001651_0084_0FB4D6B625280DF0">
Things. The&s;e Men know, that they are Corrupt, and Unregenerate; and that if the Scripture be true, they are Mi&s;erable. But they are be&s;otted and benummed, and don't feel inward Pain. Rom. 11.8. <HI>God hath given them the Spirit of deep Sleep and Slumber.</HI> This Con&s;cience differs from a Con&s;cience that is healed: For a Con|&s;cience that is healed, is very &s;en&s;ible of Judgment, and the Wrath of God again&s;t Sinners, and the truth of the Threatnings, and the Rea&s;on of its quietne&s;s is not from Unbelief, but becau&s;e his &s;tate is changed, and he is brought in to a &s;tate of Recon|ciliation with God. He perceives that God is at Peace with him, and &s;o he Rejoyces in hope of Glory. Rom. 5.1, 2. <HI>Being ju&s;tifyed by Faith, we have Peace with God, through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. By whom al&s;o we have acce&s;s into this Grace wherein we &s;tand, and Rejoyce in hope of the Glory of God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Between a flattering Con&s;cience, &amp; an hea|led Con&s;cience.</HI> Some Men have quietne&s;s in their Con&s;ciences, from fal&s;e Imaginations that they are at Peace with God. They have hopes of going to Heaven, and Ap|prehen&s;ions that Gods is reconciled to them,
<PB N="86" REF="001651_0085_0FB4D6B7454F92C8">
either from fal&s;e Principles; So <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Quakers,</HI> and <HI>Arminians,</HI> they think &s;uch things will bring them into a &s;tate of Peace, as will not. Or from fal&s;e Appre|hen&s;ions that they are converted, and have Faith and Love. Prov. 30.12. <HI>There is a Generation that are pure in their own Eyes, yet are not clean&s;ed from their Filthine&s;s.</HI> The Wounds of their Con&s;ciences are &s;kinned over, and when they are inlightned, the Wound will open again; but when the Con&s;cience is healed, Men are not under a Mi&s;take; they have a good Foundation for their Hope. 2 The&s;. 2.16. <HI>God hath loved us, and given us everla&s;ting Con&s;olation, and good Hope through Grace.</HI> Many Men find religious Affections, and a Con&s;cien&s;cious Care to plea&s;e God, and get con&s;iderable Victory over Temptations, and have &s;ome &s;uperficial Joy in the hearing of the Go&s;|pel, and &s;o they flatter them&s;elves that the bitterne&s;s of Death is pa&s;t. But when Con|&s;cience is healed, it is from an Application of the Blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What mu&s;t be done by the Man, in order to the Application of this healing Virtue?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>He mu&s;t believe the offers of the Go&s;pel to be true.</HI> Multitudes hear and read the Go&s;|pel,
<PB N="87" REF="001651_0086_0FB4D6BBC64F4F88">
that have no benefit of its healing Virtue, becau&s;e they don't believe it to be true. Heb. 4.2. <HI>The Word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with Faith in them that heard it.</HI> If the Go&s;pel were not true, it would be no Foundation of true Peace, and many are at a lo&s;s about the truth of it. Their Minds are blinded. 2 Cor. 4.4. <HI>The God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them that believe not, le&s;t the Light of the glorious Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;hine unto them.</HI> They have Objections again&s;t the Go&s;pel, and don't di&s;cern the truth of it, by the Te&s;timony of God. But in order to the healing of their Con&s;ciences, they mu&s;t be convinced of the truth of the Go&s;pel, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us is the Son of God, that his Sacrifice has &s;atisfied Ju&s;tice, that God of|fers Mercy through him. The Word mu&s;t come with a divine Authority. Men mu&s;t hear the Voice of Chri&s;t. Chri&s;t mu&s;t be revealed by the Father. 1 The&s;. 2.13. <HI>Ye received the Word, as the Word of God.</HI> Joh. 5.25. <HI>The Dead &s;hall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and live.</HI> Math. 16.17. <HI>Fle&s;h and Bloud hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father that is in Heaven.</HI></P>

Whatever commendable Quali|fications they have, they are not recon|ciled to God: And if they have not Peace with God, they cannot have true Peace of Con&s;cience.

<P>A. 1. <HI>It manife&s;ts, that God hath ju&s;tified and accepted him.</HI> This is the plain Conclu|&s;ion from the Premi&s;es. The Go&s;pel te&s;ti|fies, that he that believes is ju&s;tified. Act. 10.43. <HI>To him give all the Prophets Witne&s;s, through his Name, who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hall receive the forgivene&s;s of Sins.</HI> God is re|conciled to all believers. God that has au|thority to Pardon Sin, that is the Judge of the World, declares that he will be recon|ciled to believers; and Con&s;cience affirms, that he doth believe in Chri&s;t; he hath be|taken him&s;elf to Chri&s;t for Refuge. Some|times this is more clear to him: He can &s;ay as P&s;al. 13.5. <HI>I have tru&s;ted in thy Mercy.</HI> And &s;o he concludes that God is recon|ciled to him. He is delivered from Condem|nation, according to that, Joh. 5.24. <HI>He

Math. 5.18. <HI>Not one jot or tittle mu&s;t pa&s;s from the Law, but all mu&s;t be fulfilled.</HI> But the Go&s;pel gives a clear Account that Chri&s;t has &s;atisfied the Law.

All the Challenges of the Law have been an&s;wered by Chri&s;t, &s;o that now the Threatnings of the Law are not a Terrour to him. He &s;ees the Debt is paid, the Ac|count is cancelled; it is according to a Rule of Righteou&s;ne&s;s that he &s;hould be &s;aved. The Law lays no Bar in the way. Rom. 3.26. <HI>God is Ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him that believeth in Je&s;us.</HI> Rom. 3.31. <HI>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? God forbid: Yea, we e&s;tabli&s;h the Law.</HI></P>

Con&s;ciences. The <HI>Balm</HI> of <HI>Judea</HI> is coun|ted precious, becau&s;e of its healing Virtue. So the Go&s;pel is to be prized becau&s;e of its &s;anative Power, that it heals the Wounds that Sin has made in the Con&s;cience. There be a great many that hear the Go&s;|pel, that are not healed, but thou&s;ands have been healed by it. Every Man that doth re|ceive it, is healed thereby, whatever their Terrours were.</P>
<P N="1">1 Con&s;ider. <HI>The&s;e Wounds can't be healed any other way.</HI> Some other things can &s;tu|pify the Con&s;cience, and &s;kin the Wounds over, but nothing but the Go&s;pel can cure them. Mic 6.6.7. <HI>Wherewith &s;hall I come be|fore the Lord, and bow my &s;elf before the high God? Shall I come before him with Burnt-offerings, or Calves of a Year Old?

The biting of the fiery Serpent could not be healed, but by looking to the brazen Serpent. So there is nothing can allay the Venom of the&s;e Wounds, but the Go&s;pel. Many Men try many Conclu&s;ions, but their Wounds Stink and are Corrupt. There is no Sound|ne&s;s in their Fle&s;h, becau&s;e of God's Anger, nor any Re&s;t in their Bones, becau&s;e of their Sins. Their Bones wax Old through their Roaring all the Day, and their Moi|&s;ture is turned into the drought of Sum|mer, till the Virtue of the Go&s;pel is ap|plyed unto them.

The Wrath of God is hard to bear: It lies like a Mountain of Lead upon the Soul; and Terrours take hold of them like Waters, when the Arrows of the Almighty are within Men, the Poi&s;on of them drinks up their Spirits, and they have a dreadful Sound in their Ears. Job 15.21. Their Hearts are as heavy as Lead, their Sorrows pierce them as with the piercings of a Sword. The Wrath of God &s;earches like Fire; they are in an amazed Condition. Other Afflictions are hard to bear, the&s;e are harder. Men may bear up under other Sorrows, but the&s;e &s;ink the Soul.

<P N="2">2 USE. <HI>Of Examination, whether the Wounds of your Con&s;ciences have been healed.</HI> Some Mens Con&s;ciences are more quiet than they were.

You were amazed to think how you &s;hould &s;pend the

The thoughts of Death are not &s;uch a Terrour to you as they were: But there may be ea&s;e of Con&s;cience where there is no Healing. Some Mens Con&s;ciences are not healed, but &s;tupified. The Wounds of &s;ome Mens Con&s;ciences are only &s;kinned over, not cured. You may know it by this: When they are indeed healed, they are always healed by the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P><HI>If it were by the Go&s;pel, then you were con|vinced that nothing el&s;e would Heal you.</HI> Be|fore Men feel the Efficacy of the Go&s;pel, they mu&s;t be beaten off from all fal&s;e hopes.

If they can help them&s;elves by Prayers, De&s;ires, Sorrows Inlargements, they will neglect Chri&s;t. They will never come to Chri&s;t, till they are reduced to Extremity. If they can make a &s;hift to ea&s;e their Con&s;ciences with their Priviledges &amp; Performances, they may coun|terfeit Faith in Chri&s;t, but they will neglect him.

Your Con&s;cience mu&s;t &s;peak as God &s;peaks, that it is fair for God to ca&s;t you off; as Righteous to reject you, as if you had never made a Prayer or &s;hed a Tear for your Sins&punc; That whatever you have done, you have laid no bonds on God to &s;ave you. That you can do nothing to force God to &s;ave you; but you are after all at God's free Di&s;po&s;al. You mu&s;t &s;ee that you are <HI>without Strength,</HI> Rom. 5.6. <HI>That God is the Potter, and you are the Clay.</HI> Rom. 9.21.</P>

they do judge in their Hearts that is a &s;uf|ficient way of Salvation; but you cannot depend on the Judgment of Men, that will not &s;atisfy your Con&s;cience, that Men think there is healing Virtue in the Blood of Chri&s;t: But God doth te&s;tify to it, Dan. 9.24. <HI>Chri&s;t will fini&s;h Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion, and make an end of Sins, and make Re|conciliation for Iniquity.</HI> Rev. 5.9. <HI>Thou ha&s;t redeemed us to God by thy Blood.</HI> And he freely offers this unto you, and is ready to pardon all your Sins through Chri&s;t Je&s;us.

<P>To Preach Deliverance to the Captives.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HERE is another Expre&s;&s;ion of the Work that Chri&s;t was anointed for. Where mind, 1. The Per&s;ons that he is to be Serviceable to. The Word <HI>Captive</HI> is from <HI>Capio,</HI> to take. They are &s;uch as are taken in War. <HI>Aichmalotos</HI> is from <HI>Aichme,</HI> Spear or Sword, and <HI>Alotos,</HI> taken in War. This &s;ets forth the &s;tate of Sinners. They are by the ju&s;t Judgment of God, delivered into Satans Hands, &amp; they are his Captives. 2 Tim. 2.26. <HI>They are taken Captive by him at his Will.</HI> 2. What Service Chri&s;t was to do for them. <HI>To Preach Deliverance,</HI> to Publi&s;h or Proclaim it. His Office was not meerly to Condole their Captivity, but to Proclaim Deliverance to them. He doth not Proclaim that they are delivered, but he Proclaims an Offer of
<PB N="108" REF="001651_0107_0FB523BD5A2FD3B0">
Deliverance. He declares that there is a way of Deliverance, and makes a tender of it upon Terms.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE. <HI>God offers Deliverance to tho&s;e that are in &s;piritual Captivity.</HI> Delive|rance to them that are in bodily Captivity is a great Priviledge; but Deliverance to them that are in &s;piritual Captivity, is a far greater Priviledge. As it is more Co&s;t|ly, &s;o it is more Comfortable and Profita|ble; but this is freely offered by God. He doth not force their Deliverance without their Con&s;ent, but he makes a tender of Deliverance unto them. They cannot force their Deliverance, neither can they pur|cha&s;e their own Deliverance. <HI>What &s;hall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</HI> Math. 16.26. But God doth freely offer it to them. He doth not at pre&s;ent make an offer of it to all the World. There be great Nations that have not heard of it; but where he &s;ends his Go&s;pel, he makes an offer of it. There be many in &s;uch Places that are not delivered from this Captivity, and indeed never will be delivered; but it is not for want of an offer, but for want of their Acceptance. Some that are in Cap|tivity are delivered, and Deliverance is offered unto others.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="001651_0108_0FB523C2582B31E0">Q. <HI>Why are Sinners &s;aid to be in &s;piritual Captivity?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>Becau&s;e their Condition is re&s;embled by the Condition of Captives.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They are made to &s;erve with Rigour.</HI> Thus the <HI>Egyptians</HI> dealt with the <HI>I&s;raelites.</HI> Exod. 1.14. <HI>They made their Lives Bitter with hard Bondage, in Morter and in Brick, and in all manner of Service in the Field.</HI> All the Service wherein they made them &s;erve, was with Rigour. So Satan puts his Cap|tives to a great deal of Drudgery. He keeps them continually at Work. He hurries them from Service to Service. He makes them do a great deal of ba&s;e Work, that is be|neath the Dignity of Men. He makes them to Idolize the World, and to make <HI>Gods of their Bellies.</HI> Phil. 3.19. He makes them Lye, and Steal, and be Prophane. He makes many of them to be like <HI>the Bea&s;ts that Per|i&s;h.</HI> He drives them &s;ometimes to do things that will be a Reproach to them, that they are <HI>as the Fools in I&s;rael.</HI> 2 Sam. 13.13. He makes them to do &s;uch things as un|do them in this World. Prov. 6.33. <HI>A Wound and Di&s;honour &s;hall he get, and his Re|proach &s;hall not be wiped away.</HI> He compels them to do &s;uch things as are utterly Un|profitable,
<PB N="110" REF="001651_0109_0FB523C50E7F49D8">
and forces them to do things that di&s;plea&s;e God, and bring down his Wrath. He hurries them on to do things that Wound their Con&s;ciences. He will not allow them time, nor &s;uffer them to &s;erve God. Eph. 2.2, 3. <HI>Ye walked according to the Cour&s;e of this World, according to the Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit that now worketh in the Children of Di&s;obedience. A|mong whom we had our Conver&s;ation in times pa&s;t, in the Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h, fulfilling the De&s;ires of the Fle&s;h, and of the Mind.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They are mi&s;erably provided for.</HI> Some|times it is &s;o with Captives among Men. Deut. 28.48. <HI>Thou &s;halt &s;erve thine Enemies, which the Lord &s;hall &s;end again&s;t thee, in Hun|ger, and Thir&s;t, and Nakedne&s;s, and in the want of all things.</HI> So I&s;ai. 20.4. <HI>So the King of A&s;&s;yria &s;hall lead the Egyptians Pri&s;oners, and the Ethiopians Captives; Young and Old, Naked and Barefoot.</HI> Thus the&s;e Mens Souls are in a &s;tarved Condition; they have no|thing to &s;atisfy them; they are like the Prodigal, Luk. 15.16. <HI>He would fain have filled his Belly with the Hu&s;ks that the Swine did eat, but no Man gave unto him.</HI> They have no Heavenly <HI>Manna;</HI> they don't eat of <HI>the Tree of Life,</HI> &s;poken of, Rev. 2.7.
<PB N="111" REF="001651_0110_0FB523C6D6D517C0">
They have not that which is <HI>Meat indeed,</HI> and <HI>Drink indeed.</HI> They have in&s;atiable De|&s;ires after Happine&s;s; but they have no|thing to live upon, but that which is Cour&s;e, and Bitter, and Un&s;atisfying. They have De&s;ires after Satisfaction, but cannot find it. They are kept in an Hungry and Star|ved Condition. While other Men are en|tertained in God's Chambers, they are kept out of Doors. They come into the Meet|ing-hou&s;e, but not into the Chambers of Communion; and their Souls are mi&s;era|bly Cloathed, while others are Cloathed with change of Raiment, and their Beauty is Perfect through that Comline&s;s which God hath put upon them, and are adorn|ed with the Robes of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;|ne&s;s. The&s;e poor Captives have nothing but rotten Rags to cover them, while their Bodies are finely adorned, their Souls are Naked and Filthy: They are <HI>Polluted in their Blood.</HI> Ezek. 16.6. All their Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s is as filthy Rags.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Satan is leading them to his own Terri|tories.</HI> That is the manner of Conquerours when they have taken Captives, to lead them away to their own Country. So <HI>Ze|dekiah</HI> was dealt with. Jer. 52.11. <HI>The
<PB N="112" REF="001651_0111_0FB523C8B4891CA8">
King of Babylon bound him with Chains, and carryed him to Babylon.</HI> Thus Satan is deal|ing with the&s;e Men. The Divel him&s;elf is ca&s;t into Hell. 2 Pet. 2.4. <HI>God &s;pared not the Angels that Sinned, but ca&s;t them down to Hell.</HI> And though they be &s;uffered to Ram|ble about the Earth, yet Hell is their Home; and thither it is that they are lead|ing their Captives. The Divel is leading them in tho&s;e Paths that go down to De|&s;truction. 1 Joh. 3.8. <HI>He that committeth Sin is of the Divel.</HI> He leads them on in the Practice of Iniquity, which is the very way to Hell. He leads &s;ome in the way of Pro|phane&s;s, others in the way of Voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s, others in a way of Pride and World|line&s;s, till he brings them down to Hell. <HI>The Divel deceives them,</HI> Rev. 20.10. <HI>He de&s;troys them,</HI> Rev. 9.11. And he is bu&s;ily endeavouring to hinder them from getting out of this way. When they hear the Word, he is careful to take it away. Math. 13.19. <HI>Then cometh the wicked One, and catcheth away that which was &s;own in his Heart.</HI> He mightily oppo&s;eth their Conver&s;ion. He is &s;hewing them the Glory of the World, and blinding their Eyes that they may nor believe the Go&s;pel. 2 Cor. 4.4. <HI>The God of
<PB N="113" REF="001651_0112_0FB523CAD963DCD8">
this World hath blinded the Eyes of them that believe not, le&s;t the light of the glorious Go|&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who is the Image of God, &s;hould &s;hine unto them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 Q. <HI>What is it that is offered to the&s;e Captives?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>Not a Mitigation of the Extremity of their Captivity, but Deliverance.</HI> It is a Mer|cy to poor Captives, to have &s;ome Pity &s;hewed them in their Bondage. P&s;al. 106.46. <HI>He made them to be pitied of all tho&s;e that carried them Captive.</HI> And indeed there is &s;ome difference among tho&s;e that are Sa|tan's Captives. Some are made to do a|bundance more Drudgery than others: They are made to bla&s;t their Names, and wound their Con&s;ciences more than others, and they go along fa&s;ter in the way to De&s;truction than others: But the thing that God offers to Men in the Go&s;pel, is not a Mitigation of, but Deliverance from Captivity. Chri&s;t Je&s;us is rai&s;ed up to be a Deliverer, to be a Saviour, and he doth deliver Men. His Work is to deliver them, who through fear of Death, were all their Life-time &s;ubject to Bondage <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.15. And this is that which is offered in the Go&s;pel. He offers to make them Happy
<PB N="114" REF="001651_0113_0FB523CE4A956D48">
that were Mi&s;erable, to &s;ave them from the power of Satan. Act. 26.18 <HI>To turn them from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</HI> To deliver them from <HI>the power of Darkne&s;s,</HI> Col. 1.13. He offers to &s;et at Liberty, <HI>tho&s;e that were in Bondage.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He doth not offer Deliverance hereafter only, but pre&s;ent Deliverance.</HI> God offers the Glory of Heaven to Sinners in the Go&s;pel; but this is not to be enjoyed at pre&s;ent, but they mu&s;t go through &s;everal Calami|ties before they come thither. 1 Pet. 5.10. <HI>God has called you to his Eternal Kingdom and Glory after ye have &s;uffered a while.</HI> They may have &s;ome fore-ta&s;ts of it now, but they mu&s;t not enjoy it till they Die. But there is a pre&s;ent Deliverance offered, he that is effectually called, is <HI>the Lord's Free-Man.</HI> 1 Cor. 7.22. Satan's Dominion is immediately taken away. The Man is de|livered from &s;ervitude to Satan. 1 Joh. 5.18. <HI>He that is begotten of God, keepeth him&s;elf, and that wicked One toucheth him not.</HI> The Divel may hurry him into &s;ome Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, but his Lord&s;hip is taken away, and the Man walks in a way of Holine&s;s, and has a right to the Tree of Life. Sa|tan
<PB N="115" REF="001651_0114_0FB523D31367E158">
is ca&s;t out, and the Man is made an Heir of Heaven, and God is leading him in the way to Glory. Rom. 6.22. <HI>Ye have your Fruit unto Holine&s;s, and the End ever|la&s;ting Life.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He don't offer Deliverance for the pre&s;ent only, but Eternal Deliverance.</HI> Men that are delivered out of Captivity here, may after a while go into Captivity again, and be in as &s;ad a Condition as before; but this De|liverance is Eternal. When once they are delivered, they are never brought into &s;uch a Captivity again. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays indeed, that <HI>the Law in his Members brought him into Captivity.</HI> Rom. 7.23. The meaning is, That Sin did get &s;ome Advantage, and Tyrannize over him a while, that he was at times like a Captive; but not as he was before in his natural Condition. He never was a Servant to Sin any more. The Divel may try to recover his Dominion; he acts Craftily, and makes many A&s;&s;aults, and brings the Heart into bad Frames, and leads it into actual Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, but he has no power over him to make him walk in the way of De&s;truction. Such Per|&s;ons <HI>being the Sons of God, are led by the Spi|rit of God.</HI> Rom. 8.14. Satan is very much
<PB N="116" REF="001651_0115_0FB523D55C6E07C8">
re&s;trained by God, and all &s;uch Per&s;ons are <HI>kept by the power of God, through Faith unto Salvation.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.5.</P>
<P N="3">3 Q. <HI>On what Terms doth God offer De|liverance from this Captivity?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>Not upon the Condition of their lay|ing down the Price of their Deliverance.</HI> We can't lay down any Price of our Redemp|tion. Money will not Redeem us, if it &s;hould be laid out in Works of Piety or Charity. Math. 16.26. <HI>What &s;hall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</HI> Men have no Works to Redeem them; all the Works that they do before their Deliverance, are Sins. They run in Debt, and don't pay their Debts thereby, until they are deliv|ered. They are by all that they do, pur|cha&s;ing Damnation, and not Salvation. They are &s;aid to have <HI>no Money,</HI> I&s;ai. 55.1. Nothing that will pa&s;s in Heaven, as Mo|ney doth upon the Earth.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Nor upon Condition of their Recompencing God for it afterwards.</HI> When he delivers Men, he expects that they &s;hould <HI>&s;erve God in Ho|line&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s all the Days of their Lives.</HI> Luk. 1.74, 75. But this is not the Condition, but part of the Mercy that is offered. Men that are &s;en&s;ible of their Cap|tivity,
<PB N="117" REF="001651_0116_0FB523D6F77887F0">
are ready to promi&s;e, That if God will deliver them, they will be very Obe|dient, and &s;hew forth his Prai&s;e: But God don't regard their Promi&s;es, nor deliver them becau&s;e they promi&s;e fairly. He ex|pects no Reward from them, as in that Ca&s;e. I&s;ai. 45.13. <HI>He &s;hall let go my Cap|tives, net for Price nor Reward, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> God requires Obedience as a na|tural Debt, and likewi&s;e in a way of Thankfullne&s;s for their Deliverance, but not in a way of Recompence.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>But on Condition of accepting it as a free Gift through Chri&s;t.</HI> Deliverance is a free Gift as to us, but Chri&s;t hath pur|cha&s;ed it. Rom. 6.23. <HI>The Gift of God is Eternal Life, through Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord.</HI> And we mu&s;t accept it as &s;uch. The In|vitation is, <HI>to come and take the Water of Life freely.</HI> Rev. 22.17. And we mu&s;t take as it is offered; we mu&s;t make no Alteration in the Terms: God will have his own way: He will not &s;ell Deliverance to us but he will give it; but he will not give it ab&s;o|lutely without re&s;pect to any Price, but with re&s;pect to the Death and Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. And we mu&s;t receive it as he offers it. 1 Pet. 1.21. <HI>Who by him do
<PB N="118" REF="001651_0117_0FB523E05FF56968">
believe in God.</HI> Heb. 7.25. <HI>He is able to &s;ave them to the uttermo&s;t, who come unto God by him.</HI> We mu&s;t depend on the Grace of God, as the moving Cau&s;e, but on the Blood and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the meritorious Cau&s;e of our Salva|tion.</P>
<P N="4">4 Q. <HI>To what purpo&s;e is this offer made to Sinners, &s;eeing they have not Power to accept of it?</HI> Joh. 6.44. <HI>No Man can come unto me, except the Father that &s;ent me draw him.</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>It is no ways fit that Salvation &s;hould be forced on them without their acceptance.</HI> In this way they put a great deal of Honour upon God: They Honour the Grace of God, and his Faithfullne&s;s, and his Autho|rity. Rom. 4.20. <HI>Abraham was &s;trong in Faith, giving Glory to God.</HI> It is a Te&s;timo|ny for God, and a practical Acknowledg|ment of his Attributes; and in this way they put a great deal of Honour upon Chri&s;t. It is a Confe&s;&s;ion that he is the Son of God, and the only Mediatour be|tween God and Man; of the Sufficiency and &s;aving Virtue of his Death and Obe|dience: It manife&s;ts that the Man prizeth Chri&s;t. 1 Pet. 2.7. <HI>To them that believe Chri&s;t is Precious.</HI> And in this way there
<PB N="119" REF="001651_0118_0FB523E1818776D8">
is a Foundation for a great deal of Com|fort. God is bound now by Covenant to be&s;tow Salvation, and they are &s;ecured from Apo&s;tacy: That they &s;hall never fall into a &s;tate of Condemnation. Joh. 5.24. <HI>He that &s;eeth the Son, and believeth on him that &s;ent him, hath Eternal Life, and &s;hall not en|ter into Condemnation.</HI> The Heirs of Pro|mi&s;e hereby have &s;trong Con&s;olation.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They can do a great deal in order to their accepting of Deliverance.</HI> They can Pray ear|ne&s;tly for it. Prov. 2.3. <HI>They can cry for Wi&s;dom, and lift up their Voices for Under|&s;tanding.</HI> God &s;aith concerning <HI>Paul,</HI> Be|hold <HI>he Prayeth.</HI> Act. 9.11. They can Re|form their Lives, and leave off the Evil Practices that they have been addicted un|to. So they are directed <HI>to for&s;ake their ways,</HI> I&s;ai. 55.7. They can addict them&s;elves to ways of Obedience, duties of Piety, and Charity, and Ju&s;tice. They can re&s;i&s;t Di&s;|couragements, and di&s;cern that there is no &s;ufficient Foundation for them; they are able to examine their Hearts, and to di&s;|cern the Fal&s;ene&s;s of tho&s;e Pretences that they make to Godly Sorrow, Love and Faith; they are capable to di&s;cern their Carnal Confidence, and to find out the
<PB N="120" REF="001651_0119_0FB523E2E4B13810">
Pride and Stubbornne&s;s of their Hearts: They are able al&s;o to ju&s;tify God, and under a &s;en&s;e of their own In&s;ufficiency, wait upon God for his Mercy.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When they do what they can, God gene|rally makes the offers Powerful.</HI> When they are prepared, God's manner is to open their Eyes. When they have gone as far as they can, God's manner is to put Strength in them, and he will accompany the Go&s;pel with a Divine Power. <HI>The Go&s;pel doth be|come his Power unto Salvation,</HI> Rom. 1.16. He teaches them in that way, and makes them to come to Chri&s;t. Joh. 6.45. <HI>Every one that heareth and learneth of the Father, cometh unto me.</HI> In this way God is Breath|ing into &s;ome the Breath of Life. The&s;e offers of the Go&s;pel are not in vain, for God doth per&s;wade many thereby. I Cor. 4.15. <HI>I have Begotten you through the Go|&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 USE. <HI>See here the great Mercy of God to many Sinners.</HI> He offers Deliverance to them from Spiritual Captivity. Bodily Cap|tivity, e&s;pecially among barbarous People, <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Turks,</HI> is a great Mi&s;ery; but this Spiritual Captivity is much greater. Their Wants are very great; they live a
<PB N="121" REF="001651_0120_0FB523E458B4BCD0">
mi&s;erable Fami&s;hed Life, they are de&s;titute of tho&s;e Spiritual Comforts that the Na|ture of Man craves. They are very much Deba&s;ed, they live in &s;uch a way as is beneath the Dignity of Mankind. They indure abundance of Sorrows, and Wounds in their Con&s;ciences. They are expo&s;ed unto great Dangers: God pities them in this Condition, and offers Deliverance to them, when none el&s;e could do it. He is making a gracious Offer unto them. You are utterly uncapable to deliver your&s;elves; you have no &s;ufficiency to procure your own Liberty. Some that have been Cap|tives to Men, have got their Liberty by Running; &s;ome by being Victorious over them; &s;ome by promi&s;ing Money for their Redemption, but you are under an utter Incapacity to procure your own Liberty. You mu&s;t continue for ever in a mi&s;erable Condition, if God do not &s;et you at Li|berty: And in this Extremity God offers Deliverance to you. It would not be &s;o &s;trange, if your Deliverance would be any Advantage to God, but he gains nothing by it. It is indeed for his Honour to De|liver you; and &s;o it would be for his Ho|nour if he &s;hould refu&s;e to Deliver you:
<PB N="122" REF="001651_0121_0FB523EBC4D9C2A0">
But it is no profit to him, he is Ble&s;&s;ed for ever, whatever becomes of you. Yet he is freely offering Deliverance to you.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This is offered to you, though you brought your &s;elf into this Condition by your Rebellion.</HI> Many Men that are in Captivity, are to be pityed under that Con&s;ideration, That it was not their fault that they are Cap|tives: It was not from any Perver&s;ne&s;s or Indi&s;cretion of theirs, that they are in &s;uch a Condition, but your Captivity is the fruit of your Rebellion. Man was made in an e&s;tate of Freedom, but we ca&s;t our &s;elves into this Bondage by breaking God's Law. We might have lived happily if we would have obeyed, but ventured for the &s;ake of the <HI>Forbidden Fruit,</HI> to go abrea&s;t again&s;t God's Law, and plunged our &s;elves into this Mi&s;ery. Rom. 3.23. <HI>Man has Sinned, and fallen &s;hort of the Glory of God.</HI> God might have &s;aid, <HI>Seeing they would be Mi&s;erable, let them be Mi&s;erable: They &s;hould have known when they were well; their Mi|&s;ery is no more than they de&s;erve.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Clau&s;e mind 1. The Charecter of tho&s;e that he is to Preach to, <HI>viz.</HI> Tho&s;e that <HI>are Blind.</HI> There is 1. A Bodily Blindne&s;s, which ari&s;eth from &s;eve|ral Cau&s;es, when Men are not able to di&s;|cern Bodily Objects, either through the want of Organs, or the Indi&s;po&s;ition of them.

Sometimes they cannot &s;ee from the want of Light, or from the Interpo&s;ition of &s;ome Opake Body; But Blindne&s;s ri&s;eth from &s;ome Default in the Body. 2. A Spiritual Blindne&s;s, when Men cannot &s;ee God, or any Spiritual Thing. Thus it is with Un|godly Men. 3. Epi&s;t. Joh. 11. <HI>He that doth Evil, hath not &s;een God.</HI> Rev. 3.17. <HI>Thou art Poor, and Blind, and Naked.</HI> This Blind|ne&s;s may be the greater, by rea&s;on of con|tracted evil Habits, and the Temptation of Satan. 2 Cor. 4.4. <HI>The God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them that believe not.</HI> 2. What he was to Preach, <HI>viz. Re|covery of Sight. Adam</HI> had Spiritual Under|&s;tanding, but we have lo&s;t it, and mu&s;t have our Sight recovered. <HI>Q.</HI> How was he to Preach the Recovery of Sight? He was not properly to offer it to them, though he offers further degrees of Sight to his People. Rev. 3.18. <HI>I Coun&s;el thee to buy of me Gold tried in the Fire, white Raiment, and to anoint thy Eyes with Eye-&s;alve, that thou may&s;t &s;ee.</HI> Yet he mu&s;t &s;ee before he can come to Chri&s;t. Men mu&s;t come to Chri&s;t Under|&s;tandingly. Joh. 6.45. <HI>Every one that hath heared and learned of the Father, cometh unto Chri&s;t.</HI> But that which he Preaches, is,
<PB N="134" REF="001651_0133_0FB5241098D861D0">
That there is an Opportunity to have the Sight recovered: They were under an ad|vantage to have their Eyes opened.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE. <HI>They that live under the Preaching of the Go&s;pel, have an opportunity to have their Eyes opened.</HI> It is one of the great Mi&s;eries of Mankind, that they are Blind; and it is a great Priviledge to re|cover their Sight. There is opportunity for this, by the Preaching of the Go&s;pel. Tho&s;e that live in Heatheni&s;h Darkne&s;s, have no opportunity to have their Eyes opened. They that belong to the vi&s;ible Kingdom of Darkne&s;s, do al&s;o belong to the invi&s;ible Kingdom of Darkne&s;s. But they that have the Light of the Go&s;pel &s;hining among them, have an opportunity to have their Eyes opened. All that live under the Preaching of the Go&s;pel, have not the like opportunity. In Chri&s;t's time, they had a greater opportunity than be|fore. The more clearly and powerfully it is taught, the greater is the opportunity: But where it is taught, there is an oppor|tunity. People are under an Advantage to have their Eyes opened. Act. 26.18. I &s;end thee <HI>to open their Eyes, to turn them from Dark|ne&s;s to Light.</HI> Col. 1.3. <HI>He hath delivered us form the power of Darkne&s;s.</HI></P>

There is a clear Explication of the Proper|ties of God's Nature, of the lo&s;t E&s;tate of Man, of the Work of Redemption by Chri&s;t; his Per&s;on, his Offices, his Humiliation, and his Exaltation, and of the Covenant of Grace, and the Condition of Salvation. 1. Cor. 2.10. <HI>God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.</HI> Yea, the&s;e Things are not barely told, but there is a great deal of Evidence and Demon&s;tration of them: So that hereby Men come to have a Literal Knowledge of them, even of all things that are needful to Salvation. 2 Tim. 3.15. <HI>The Holy Scriptures are able to make thee wi&s;e unto Salvation.</HI> Yea, Men have &s;uch Con|viction of them, as makes them concerned to get a &s;piritual Under&s;tanding of them.

This is one great Help: The Object that they &s;hould &s;ee, is fairly pre&s;ented before them in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They have a Conviction &s;et before them, that they are Blind.</HI> In the Go&s;pel, there is a Declaration of Man's Blindne&s;s. There is a Divine Te&s;timony that Men are Blind. Men naturally are Ignorant of it, but God gives Witne&s;s to it. Eph. 4.18. <HI>Having their Under&s;tandings darkned, being alienated from the Life of God, through the Ignorance that is in them, becau&s;e of the Blindne&s;s of their Heart.</HI> Be&s;ides, there they may learn how they come to be Blind, that by the fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> their whole Nature is Cor|rupted. Rom. 3.23. <HI>Man has Sinned, and has fallen &s;hort of the Glory of God.</HI> And as the Will is depraved, &s;o the Mind likewi&s;e. It is made Evident al&s;o from hence, that God has made great Provi&s;ion that we may recover our Sight. He has made it the Office of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to give Light and Under&s;tanding to us. I&s;ai. 49.6. <HI>I will give thee al&s;o to be a Light unto the Gentiles.</HI> Joh. 9.39. <HI>For Judgment came I into the World, that they that &s;ee not, might &s;ee.</HI> He &s;hews our Blindne&s;s by the &s;orrowful Ef|fects of it, living a Sinful and Corrupt

He that &s;aith, <HI>I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him.</HI> And hereby he &s;hews us our Blindne&s;s, in revealing things that our Rea&s;on and Con&s;ciences tell us mu&s;t be &s;o. And yet we cannot &s;ee nor believe them. There is &s;uch Evidence, that we mu&s;t &s;ay, it can't be otherwi&s;e: And yet we are not able to give Enter|tainment to them. We are &s;ilenced, yet not convinced.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They are directed what to do, that they may &s;ee.</HI> We are taught, that we mu&s;t Pray to God to open our Eyes. A &s;eeing Eye, and an hearing Ear, the Lord is the maker of them both. Men are ready to think that they &s;hall get the Knowledge of God and Chri&s;t, by improving their Natural Rea&s;on, by Study and Con&s;ideration; that they can argue them&s;elves into the Know|ledge of Spiritual Things: But it is quite beyond them, and they mu&s;t be brought to beg it of God. Prov. 2.3. <HI>They mu&s;t cry for Wi&s;dom, and lift up their Voice for Un|der&s;tanding.</HI> The Go&s;pel &s;hews that it is

It is a &s;orrowful Thing, that Men &s;hould have &s;uch low Thoughts of God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who de&s;erve &s;o much E&s;teem.

<P>DOCTRINE. <HI>The Go&s;pel doth &s;et many at Liberty that were in the Condition of Pri|&s;oners.</HI> Many Men are not the better for the Go&s;pel, but the wor&s;e; but it is very Profitable unto &s;ome. They are naturally in a very &s;orrowful Condition; they are like Pri&s;oners: But by the Go&s;pel they are &s;et at Liberty. Such ungodly Men as are Dead, are in Pri&s;on. 1 Pet. 3.19. And &s;uch ungodly Men as are Living, are in Pri&s;on al&s;o. But God by the Go&s;pel, has &s;et many of this latter &s;ort at Liberty.

<P>Q. <HI>How are Sinners in the Condition of Pri|&s;oners?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>They are Guilty of many Crimes.</HI></P>
<P>When Men are &s;hut up in Pri&s;on, it is generally either for Debts or for Crimes; &s;o ungodly Men are very Criminal: They are Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the Law; they came Sinners into the World. P&s;al. 51.5. <HI>Behold I was &s;hapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</HI> And as they grow up, they become more Guilty. They are Guil|ty of Sins of <HI>Omi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion:</HI> Of Sins in Thought, Word and Deed. They are Guilty of Sins by Perpetration, and by Participation with others: Sins again&s;t the Law, and again&s;t the Go&s;pel. They are very Guilty, and liable to the Condemna|tion of the Law. They have been led away with Temptation. The Corruptions of their Hearts work very Powerfully in them. Rom. 7.5. <HI>When we were in the Fle&s;h, the Motions of Sins which were by the Law, did work in our Members to bring forth Fruit un|to
<PB N="162" REF="001651_0161_0FB524631BB9BF70">
Death.</HI> And tho' &s;ome of them are under great Re&s;traints, yet their Hearts are Foun|tains of Iniquity. Job 15.16. <HI>How much more Filthy and Abominable is Man, who Drinketh in Iniquity like Water?</HI> Jer. 6.7. <HI>As a Fountain ca&s;teth out its Waters, &s;o &s;he ca&s;teth out her Wickedne&s;s.</HI> Mens Sins are more than the Hairs of their Heads. The mo&s;t moral Man is far from being Inno|cent. God hath a great deal to charge up|on them. They Sin daily, and their Iniqui|ties are infinite.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They are re&s;erved to Judgment.</HI> The Evil Angels are re&s;erved in the Chains of God's Providence to the Judgment of the great Day. Jud. 6. As Pri&s;oners are kept in Durance, that they may be forth com|ing at the A&s;&s;izes, &s;o the&s;e Men are bound over unto Judgment, and pre&s;erved that they may appear when God calls for them. They are pre&s;erved from Annihilation, and kept by God unto that time. They are not di&s;charged from their Guilt, but God has them in hold, that they may be brought forth when he calls for them. Some of them could be glad to be turned into their fir&s;t nothing, but that will not be allowed. They are kept by the Provi|dence

of God, ready to appear at God's Tribunal at the fir&s;t Call. Men that are kept in Pri&s;on, are ready to be brought forth at any time when the Judge calls for them. They are not &s;uffered to wander a|bout that they can't be found; &s;o the&s;e Men are kept in a readine&s;s to make their Appearance. <HI>There is an appointed Time to them,</HI> Job 7.1. God calls for &s;ome of them in younger Days, Job 36.14. <HI>They Die in Youth, and their Life is among the Unclean.</HI> And &s;ome in elder Days, they are never to &s;eek, God has them always in hold.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They are &s;ecured from making their E&s;|cape.</HI> Pri&s;oners are wont to be in Chains, P&s;al. 105.18. <HI>He was laid in Iron.</HI> So <HI>Peter,</HI> Act. 12.6, 7. <HI>Peter was Sleeping between two Soldiers, bound with two Chains.&mdash; And his Chains fell off his Hands.</HI> So <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> were &s;ecured, <HI>their Feet were made fa&s;t in the Stocks,</HI> Act. 16.24. So Sinners are under &s;uch Bonds, that they cannot make their E&s;cape. The Law binds them over to Puni&s;hment. 1 Cor. 15.56. <HI>The Sting of Death is Sin, and the &s;trength of Sin is the Law.</HI> And they can't free them&s;elves from that Obligation. If they could &s;atisfy the Law, they might be at Liberty, but they

cannot. Wealth will not do it. Math. 16.26. <HI>What &s;hall be given in Exchange for the Soul?</HI> Their Works will not do it. Rom. 3.20. <HI>By the Works of the Law &s;hall no Fle&s;h living be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God.</HI> Calamities and Sufferings will not do it. They are but the beginning of Sorrws. Rom. 6.23. <HI>The Wages of Sin is Death.</HI> And they are fettered with their own Corruptions. There is a way to e&s;cape, if they could believe in Chri&s;t they &s;hould be delivered; but they are <HI>&s;hut up in Unbelief,</HI> Rom. 11.32. They are like a Man bound down, that he cannot &s;tir Hand or Foot. They are not able to make u&s;e of their Opportunity. They are wholly under the Power of their Corruption. Joh. 5.44. <HI>How can you Believe?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>They are committed to a Jailor.</HI> Pri&s;o|ners are committed to the Cu&s;tody of the <HI>Keeper of the Pri&s;on.</HI> Gen. 39.21. And the Jailor many times keeps the Pri&s;oners at Work. Judg. 16.21. <HI>Sam&s;on did Grind in the Pri&s;on-Hou&s;e.</HI> And many times he u&s;es them hardly, Act. 16.24. So ungodly Men are committed to Satan as their Jailor, and he is &s;uffered to Tyrannize over them. He keeps them hard at Work, and Rules over them. He is a <HI>Prince over them.</HI> Eph. 2.2.

They are Servants to him. He makes &s;ome of them to walk in ways of Debauchery. They Lye, and Steal, and commit Whore|dom. He makes others Drudges to the World and their Pride. He keeps them bu&s;ie at Work, and many times Afflicts them, and Frights them with Imaginati|ons of Poverty and Di&s;grace, and Lo&s;&s;es, and Calamities; and if they are labouring after their E&s;cape, he Torments them. Sometimes he Terrifies them that their Day is pa&s;t; that they have committed the unpardonable Sin; that God has given them up to hardne&s;s; that if they enter|tain Convictions, and mind eternal Things, they will be Di&s;tracted, or &s;o Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that they will be forced to lay violent Hands on them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How doth the Go&s;pel &s;et them at Li|berty?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>The Di&s;coveries of the Go&s;pel do encou|rage Sinners to accept of the Liberty that is offer|ed.</HI> God is offering Liberty in the Go&s;pel; and the&s;e offers by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, do prevail upon many Souls. 1 Cor. 4.15. <HI>I have Begotten you through the Go&s;pel.</HI> Jam. 1.18. <HI>Of his own Will begat he us by the Word of Truth.</HI> Men are wont to make
<PB N="166" REF="001651_0165_0FB5246E861EB238">
many Objections again&s;t the Calls of God; but when they have the &s;piritual Di&s;covery of the Go&s;pel, it prevails upon the Heart, and conquers all the Oppo&s;ition of the Soul, and the Men come to Chri&s;t. When|ever Men are convinced of the Glory of Chri&s;t, and of the Truth of the Go&s;pel, their Will is gained, and they are not a|fraid to come to Chri&s;t. Joh. 6.45. <HI>Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</HI> There is Encouragement enough in the Go&s;pel, and when their Eyes are opened to &s;ee it, they cannot tarry away from Chri&s;t. They will come without any delay. They &s;ee that they may &s;afely come. The Go&s;pel bani&s;hes the Fears that they were under. When they &s;ee the Go&s;pel, they prize Chri&s;t; they love to come; it plea&s;eth them to depend upon him. Then they are afraid to &s;tay away, and neglect their Opportunity any longer, they &s;hould be Enemies to their own Souls if they &s;hould. Rom. 1.16. <HI>The Go&s;pel is the power of God unto Salvation, to every one that believeth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Sentence of the Go&s;pel doth di&s;charge them from their Bonds.</HI> When the Sinner has accepted the offer, he hath performed
<PB N="167" REF="001651_0166_0FB5246FD86F91C8">
the Terms of the Covenant, and now the Sentence of Condemnation is taken off. Rom. 8.1. <HI>There is no Condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> The Debt is can|celled, and all his Sins are pardoned. Act. 10.43. <HI>And to him give all the Prophets Witne&s;s, that through his Name, who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hall receive Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</HI> The Law looks on him as Innocent; the Man is brought into an e&s;tate of Ju&s;tifica|tion and Adoption. Rom. 5.1. <HI>Being ju&s;ti|fied by Faith, we have Peace who God.</HI> Joh. 1.12. <HI>To as many as received him, gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</HI> They are declar|ed Heirs of Life, Joh. 3.36. <HI>He that believ|eth on the Son, hath everla&s;ting Life.</HI> Now the Man has Security under God's Hand, that he &s;hall be &s;aved. His Obligation to &s;uffer the Wrath of God is taken off. The Word of God gives Judgment for him, that he is not Guilty. God don't deny to Pardon him. God don't leave the Matter in Su&s;pence whether he &s;hall be pardoned or not. He don't defer to do it, but in the &s;ame Minute gives him an Acquittance from all his Guilt. Act. 13.39. <HI>All that be|lieve are ju&s;tified from all things, from which
<PB N="168" REF="001651_0167_0FB52474550CC758">
they could not be ju&s;tified by the Law of Mo&s;es.</HI> And then God delivers them from the pow|er of Satan, they are no longer under his Cu&s;tody; he is not their Jailor; he Tempts them &s;till, but they are not in his power as they were. Satan is laid under greater Re|&s;traints than formerly, and not &s;uffered to Tyrannize as he did. They are commit|ted to the Guardian&s;hip of the holy An|gels. Hebr. 1.14. <HI>Are they not all Mini&s;tring Spirits, &s;ent forth to Mini&s;ter to them that &s;hall be Heirs of Salvation?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 USE. <HI>Of Reproof to tho&s;e that don't make this U&s;e of the Go&s;pel, that they may be &s;et at Liberty.</HI> Some take Notice of their Oppor|tunity, and are be&s;tirring of them&s;elves that they may be &s;et at Liberty. They are not di&s;couraged, though they find Diffi|culties in the way, and are &s;en&s;ible of the uncertainty of the Event, but take a great deal of Pains. If they &s;hould obtain it, they will be happy Men; but this is not the Ca&s;e with all: Some don't regard to make Improvement of their Time: They are very much to blame. It is a great Pri|viledg to be &s;et at Liberty. This was Pur|cha&s;ed with a great Price, as he &s;ays, Act. 22.28. <HI>With a great Sum obtained I this Free|dom.</HI>
<PB N="169" REF="001651_0168_0FB524774DDF3D30">
Chri&s;t Je&s;us was <HI>Anointed of God to Preach this.</HI> I&s;ai. 61.1. But &s;ome Men don't make U&s;e of the Go&s;pel to get Li|berty, but make a very contrary U&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Some make U&s;e of it only to get Notional Knowledge.</HI> Some read the Scriptures, hear|ken to the Preaching of the Go&s;pel, &s;tudy the Controver&s;ies that are in the World about Matters of Religion, that they may get Notional Knowledge; and they are puffed up with that. 1 Cor. 8.1. <HI>Knowledge puffeth up.</HI> They take delight to know what Men &s;ay, to be able to Di&s;cour&s;e about tho&s;e Things, and to di&s;pute again&s;t Er|rors. They love to be able to give an Ac|count what one Party and the other has to &s;ay for their Opinions. They are like the <HI>Greeks that &s;ought after Wi&s;dom.</HI> 1 Cor. 1.22. They are not willing to be Ignorant of the Scriptures: They are willing to &s;ee the Rea&s;on of what is taught, and to be able to vindicate their Profe&s;&s;ion, but don't re|gard to get this Liberty. They neglect the great de&s;ign of the Go&s;pel: They don't an&s;wer God's end in &s;ending the Go&s;pel. Can they imagine that God's de&s;ign was to fill the Heads of Men with Notions, and to gratify an inqui&s;itive Humour?
<PB N="170" REF="001651_0169_0FB5247B223BA430">
Surely God's de&s;ign was to deliver Men from Mi&s;ery. The&s;e Men neglect that which makes the Go&s;pel Profitable: They ca&s;t off the care of the Wellfare of their Souls, and neglect ble&s;&s;ed Advantages to be Happy. It is ju&s;t as if a &s;ick Man &s;hould di&s;pute about the Compo&s;ition of a Me|dicine that will Cure him, and neglect to take it and &s;o die. Or as if a Man &s;hould Labour to &s;atisfy his Curio&s;ity about the Dimen&s;ions and Materials of a Ca&s;tle, and neglect to put him&s;elf into it, and &s;o Peri&s;h.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Some make U&s;e of it to harden their Hearts in Sin.</HI> This is the way of many Men; they hear that God hath a de&s;ign of Grace; that he hath &s;ent Chri&s;t to &s;uffer for our Sins; that great Sinners may be pardoned; that the Threatnings are only Conditional in ca&s;e of final Impenitency; and they take occa&s;ion to harden their Hearts in Sin, Jud. 4. <HI>They turn the Grace of God into La&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> They think there is no great danger; they are not afraid of the Ju&s;tice and Jealou&s;y of God, becau&s;e

he offers Pardon to them; they think that he loves them, becau&s;e he freely offers Par|don to them; they think there is not much Evil in Sin, becau&s;e God offers Pardon, they think he will continue &s;o to do, and he will wait upon them, and &s;o they har|den their Hearts, and are bold to indulge them&s;elves in Sin, and in no ha&s;t to turn to God. This is unrea&s;onable. <HI>David</HI> &s;ays, <HI>There is forgivene&s;s with God, that he may be feared.</HI> P&s;al. 130.4. But the&s;e Men &s;ay, <HI>There is forgivne&s;s with God, therefore he is not to be feared.</HI> But though there is a way of Salvation, yet many that hear it, are ne|ver the better for it. Multitudes go from under the Light of the Go&s;pel to the Black|ne&s;s of Darkne&s;s. 2 Cor. 4.3. <HI>If our Go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t.</HI> It is a <HI>Savour of Death unto Death to many Men.</HI> 2 Cor. 2.16. The Mercy of God will not Affront his Ju&s;tice. Men &s;hall have no oc|ca&s;ion to Reproach that, Exod. 34.7. Though he is Gracious and Merciful, yet <HI>he will by no means clear the Guilty.</HI> The&s;e Men turn the Go&s;pel into Poy&s;on to them; and if they continue to harden their Hearts in Sin, they will as &s;urely Peri&s;h, as if there were no Go&s;pel, as if Chri&s;t had

<P N="2">2 USE. <HI>See how great a benefit the Go&s;pel is to many Men.</HI> Indeed there be a great many Men that are not the better for it; they have bought Bibles, and have Read often in them, and heard the Go&s;pel preached, but they are not the better, but the wor&s;e for it. It had been better for them, if they had never heard a Sermon, never &s;een one Leaf of the Bible, if they had lived in <HI>Turkey.</HI> Math. 11.22. <HI>It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the Day of Judgment, than for them.</HI> But it is very beneficial to others: It is more ad|vantage to them, than all the Wealth of the World would be.

The Day of Judgment will be a Glorious and Comfortable Day to them. That is a time of Refre&s;hing from the Pre|&s;ence of the Lord. There &s;hall not be one Hair of their Head &s;inged, nor the &s;mell of Fire pa&s;s upon them. There is abundant Security that they &s;hall not be Condemn|ed. They are made meet for Heaven; they are become the Children of God: They are intere&s;ted in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t: They have the Covenant of Grace to &s;ecure them: Death will do them no hurt; they &s;hall be ab&s;olved in the Day of Judgment. Joh. 5.24. <HI>They &s;hall not enter into Condemnation, but are pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From the Expectation of Condemnation.</HI> Many Men are in a dreadful Condition, becau&s;e of the Expectation of Condemna|tion. They are a Terrour to them&s;elves. Job 15.21. <HI>A dreadful Sound is in their Ears.</HI> They are under an Expectation to hear Chri&s;t &s;aying, <HI>Depart from me, I know you not.</HI> They are afraid by Day and by Night;

But tho&s;e Men that are &s;et at Liberty by the Go&s;pel, are delivered from the&s;e Expectations: They have their Hours of Temptation, and long for more A&s;&s;urance, but their Con&s;ciences are healed. Rom. 5.1, 2. <HI>Being ju&s;tified by Faith, we have Peace with God through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: By whom al&s;o we have acce&s;s by Faith into this Grace wherein we &s;tand, and Rejoyce in hope of the Glory of God.</HI> They have a great deal of Comfort under their Afflictions, under this Con&s;ideration, that God hath delivered them from Wrath to come. And &s;ometimes they can &s;ay as <HI>Job,</HI> Job 19.25, 26, 27. <HI>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that though Worms de|&s;troy this Body, yet in my Fle&s;h I &s;hall &s;ee God, whom I &s;hall &s;ee for my &s;elf, and mine Eyes &s;hall behold,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They are delivered from Satan's Govern|ment.</HI> He is permitted to Afflict them, and Tempt them, and ca&s;t in fiery Darts, yet his Government is taken away, he is ca&s;t out. They are re&s;cued out of his Hands, <HI>turned from the power of Satan,</HI> Act. 26.18.
<PB N="175" REF="001651_0174_0FB5248A833292B0">
They are delivered out of the <HI>Kingdom of Darkne&s;s,</HI> that is Satan's Kingdom. Col. 1.13. And God will tread Satan under their Feet &s;hortly. Satan is under greater Re|&s;traints than he was, and they are forti|fied again&s;t his Temptations more than they were; and they are committed to the care of the holy Angels, who are doing many good Offices for them. Heb. 1.14. <HI>They are mini&s;tring Spirits to them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 USE. <HI>Of Examination, whether you be &s;et at Liberty by the Go&s;pel.</HI> Some Men need not trouble them&s;elves to make any nar|row &s;earch, for it is a plain Ca&s;e that they are not &s;et at Liberty; but there are two &s;orts that need to examine this Matter. Some Men have &s;ome Fears and Jealou&s;ies of them&s;elves, yet have preponderating Hopes: And &s;ome Men are not without Hopes, yet have preponderating Fears. It concerns both the&s;e &s;orts accurately to ex|amine the Thing. Men may hear the Go|&s;pel, yet not be &s;et at Liberty by it. Many that hear the Word deceive them&s;elves. They may have a large under&s;tanding of the Go&s;pel, yet not be &s;et at Liberty by it. Men may be affected with it, yet not be &s;et at Liberty by it. Men may be &s;tirred up
<PB N="176" REF="001651_0175_0FB5248C962CF0E0">
to reform their Lives, yet not be &s;et at Liberty. There be but a few comparatively that are &s;et at Liberty by it, therefore ex|amine.</P>
<P>Signs, 1. <HI>Have you &s;een the Divine Autho|rity of the Go&s;pel?</HI> God is &s;aid to be the Authour of the Go&s;pel, and therefore it is called the Go&s;pel of God. Rom. 1.1. <HI>Se|parated unto the Go&s;pel of God.</HI> It is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by the Faithfulne&s;s of God. The De|clarations of it are Gods, and the Promi&s;es of it are Gods; and you are able to evince it by &s;everal Arguments that God is the Authour of it; but have you &s;een the Di|vine Authority of it? Men never &s;ee it to be infallibly true and certain, until they &s;ee the Divine Authority of it. They can't indeed believe it, whatever Per&s;wa&s;ion they have of it, till they hear the Voice of God in it; then they &s;ee the Divine Au|thority of it, when they receive it not as the Judgment of Wi&s;e and Good Men, but as it is <HI>indeed the Word of God;</HI> and they are convinced that it is the Word of the Faith|ful God. 1 The&s;. 2.13. <HI>Ye received it as it is indeed the Word of God, which worketh effectually in you that believe.</HI> Joh. 5.25. <HI>The Dead &s;hall hear the Voice of the Son of God and
<PB N="177" REF="001651_0176_0FB5248E5C146290">
Live.</HI> When the Authority of God in the Go&s;pel is &s;een, then Chri&s;t appears Glori|ous and promi&s;es Certain.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Have you felt a divine Power with the Go&s;pel?</HI> There is a divine Power going with the Go&s;pel to &s;ome Men. 1 Cor. 1.23. <HI>Chir&s;t is the Power of God, and the Wi&s;dom of God.</HI> Rom. 1.16. <HI>I am not a&s;hamed of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, for it is the power of God un|to Salvation.</HI> The Go&s;pel where it &s;ets Men at Liberty, has a Power to draw Men to Chri&s;t. Some Men complain that they are not able to come to Chri&s;t; they would do it but they have not Liberty; but in|deed there is a Power to draw the Heart: It has a prevailing Power over all Fears and Objections. Joh. 6.45. <HI>Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</HI> If the Arm of the Lord be reveal|ed Men will believe. I&s;ai. 53.1. When Men's Eyes are opened to under&s;tand Chri&s;t and his Death and Re&s;urrection, tho&s;e Doctrines come with Power upon the Heart. Phil. 3.10. <HI>That I may know him, and the Power of his Re&s;urrection.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.3. <HI>He hath begotten us to a lively Hope, by the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t from the Dead.</HI> So there is a regenerating Power in the Go&s;pel, it
<PB N="178" REF="001651_0177_0FB5249071BB6648">
doth powerfully di&s;po&s;e their Hearts to love and fear God; and they will hate their Sins, and ca&s;t off the Works of Darkne&s;s, and live all their Days in a way of Obe|dience.</P>
<P N="4">4 USE <HI>Of Exhortation. Labour in it, that you may be &s;et at Liberty by the Go&s;pel.</HI> If there were no Hope of being &s;et at Liber|ty, it would be a vain Thing to &s;trive in it; but though it be Hopele&s;s for Men that are damned, yet it is not Hopele&s;s for you. It is uncertain whether you will ever at|tain Liberty, but yet there is Hope of it. Sometimes the Thing appears very Dark to you; but whatever Difficulty there be in it, yet it is po&s;&s;ible. You have taken &s;e|veral Methods that you might be &s;et at Li|berty, but hitherto you have been di&s;ap|pointed; and indeed you mu&s;t never ex|pect it by any other Means but only by the Go&s;pel. Labour therefore that you may be &s;et at Liberty by that. You &s;ay your pre&s;ent Condition is Doleful, and you dread to continue in it, but there is Hope of Deliverance by the Go&s;pel. Chri&s;t Je&s;us has purcha&s;ed Deliverance; he has paid a &s;ufficient Price for your Redemption. He gave his Life a Ran&s;om for many. 1 Cor.
<PB N="179" REF="001651_0178_0FB52492CF3D4E60">
6.20. <HI>Ye are bought with a Price.</HI> And God offers Deliverance to you through him. I&s;ai. 61.1. He Proclaims the <HI>opening of the Pri&s;on to them that are Bound.</HI> And God has promi&s;ed that &s;ome &s;hall be &s;et at Liberty by him. His Work is, <HI>To bring out the Pri|&s;oners from Pri&s;on, and them that &s;it in Dark|ne&s;s out of the Pri&s;on-Hou&s;e.</HI> I&s;ai. 42.7. Yea, many Per&s;ons have been &s;et at Liberty Formerly and Laterly by the Go&s;pel. There has been a great deal or Experience of the Efficacy of the Go&s;pel this way. Col. 1.13. <HI>He hath delivered us from the power of Dark|ne&s;s, and tran&s;lated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</HI> Let then this be your Care, that you may be &s;et at Liberty by the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>DIRECTIONS, 1. <HI>Don't &s;eek &s;lightily.</HI> This is the fault of many Per&s;ons, inti|mated, Luk. 13.24. <HI>Many &s;eek, and are not able to enter.</HI> That is complained of, I&s;ai. 64.7. <HI>There is none that &s;tirreth up him&s;elf to take hold of thee.</HI> Some Men &s;eek, but it is with too much indifferency of Spirit. <HI>The Violent take the Kingdom of Heaven by force.</HI> Math. 11.12. But many Men are dull in their Prayers; they are not Earne&s;t and Importunate with God; they are not

Diligent in Reading and Hearing, that they may learn Advantages and take them; that they learn their Di&s;advantages and avoid them. They don't watch again&s;t Temptations; they comply with &s;ome Pra|ctices that are an hindrance to them: They excu&s;e them&s;elves many times from that which might promote their Conver&s;ion. Though they de&s;ire Conver&s;ion, yet their Hearts are much upon the World; they lay too much weight on worldly Things; their Hearts are divided between <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Mammon.</HI> It is no great Wonder that &s;uch Men don't obtain; lazy Seekings i&s;&s;ue in Di&s;appointments: Lazy Seeking will not conquer Difficulties. Yea, when they &s;eek &s;lightly, they provoke God to deny them. God may &s;ay, <HI>It will not break their Hearts if they be denied.</HI> The Rea&s;on why many People &s;eek after a &s;light Manner, is be|cau&s;e they are not much afraid of going to Hell. Either they want a &s;en&s;e of the Dreadfullne&s;s of Damnation, or flatter them|&s;elves as if they were in no eminent Dan|ger of it. If they were thoroughly &s;cared, they would be more earne&s;t in their En|deavours; Sen&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s begets Slightline&s;s. If their Con&s;ciences were &s;o wounded that

they could not bear it, they would be more violent in their Endeavours. The Pretence that thay make for their Dullne&s;s, is, that they are afraid there is no Hope for them; they fear their Ca&s;e is de&s;parate, and that weakens their Hearts, and makes them to be di&s;pirited; but the true Rea&s;on is not that they want Hope, but they want Fears. If the <HI>Terrours of Death did compa&s;s them a|bout, and the Pains of Hell get hold upon them,</HI> they would not &s;ay, <HI>There was a Lyon in the Way,</HI> but would be forcing their Way through all Di&s;couragements and dark Ap|pearances.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Don't imagine that you mu&s;t get &s;ome Excellency to prepare you for Chri&s;t.</HI> Men a|mong us are principled in that, that Faith is the Condition of Salvation, and the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is the meritorious Cau&s;e of it: But they imagine that they mu&s;t get &s;ome Excellency to prepare them for Chri&s;t. They think they may not come to him till they have make their Hearts better. They mu&s;t love God, and be &s;orry for their Sins, and make the Glory of God their End. They mu&s;t delight in Sabbaths, and &s;o they are &s;triving to make their Hearts better, and if that were attained,
<PB N="182" REF="001651_0181_0FB5249BC3AC71E8">
they hope that God would not be &s;o An|gry with them; he would be more inclina|ble to pity them, and &s;ave them through Chri&s;t; and they labour to dre&s;s up their Hearts, and to get lovely Qualifications to draw God's Heart towards them. They think it would be a pre&s;umptious Thing for them to thru&s;t them&s;elves on Chri&s;t, and on the Grace of God until they be better, and &s;o they &s;trive to make them|&s;elves better. They hear that there mu&s;t be Preparation for Chri&s;t, and that there mu&s;t be a Work of Humiliation before Faith, and they &s;trive after &s;uch an Hu|miliation as has an Excellency in it to com|mend them to God. They quite mi&s;take Humiliation; but if ever you would obtain Chri&s;t, you mu&s;t &s;ee the badne&s;s of your own Hearts. As long as you are reaching after any Excellency in your &s;elves, you will reject Chri&s;t. You mu&s;t &s;ee your &s;elf <HI>Poor,</HI> Rev. 3.17. Before ever <HI>Paul</HI> came to Chri&s;t, <HI>Sin revived and he died.</HI> Rom. 7.9.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Don't give way to an objecting Spirit again&s;t the Go&s;pel.</HI> We Read of &s;ome that the Go&s;pel was hid unto: <HI>That the God of this World had blinded their Minds.</HI> 2 Cor. 4.

3, 4. And we Read, that <HI>Chri&s;t Crucified, was to the Jews a Stumbling-block, and to the Greeks Fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI> 1 Cor. 1.22. One great Thing that keeps Men from Chri&s;t is, that Satan and their own Hearts are filling of them with Objections again&s;t the Go&s;pel. Sometimes they argue as if God had not Mercy enough to Pardon their Sins. Some|times they are arguing as if it were uncer|tain whether the Scriptures were the Word of God. Sometimes they argue from the differing Opinions that are in the World about the way of Salvation. Sometimes they are &s;tumbled at the Afflictions of tho&s;e that believe on Chri&s;t. Sometimes from the Falls of tho&s;e that make a great Profe&s;&s;ion. Sometimes from the outward Meane&s;s and Sufferings of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Such Rea&s;on|ings of Heart, are a great hindrance to Mens receiving of the Go&s;pel. While Men entertain &s;uch Objections, they &s;trengthen their Unbelief, and keep them&s;elves from a preparedne&s;s to entertain the Go&s;pel. Men that do indulge them&s;elves in a Lu&s;t of objecting again&s;t the Go&s;pel, do hin|der them&s;elves from receiving it. <HI>Paul</HI> de&s;cribes Unbelievers, that <HI>they are Con|tentious, and obey not the Truth.</HI> Rom. 2.8.
<PB N="184" REF="001651_0183_0FB524A46DAEFDF8">
Unbelief is naturally Blindne&s;s, but if Men give way to an objecting Spirit, they thereby contract further degrees of Blind|ne&s;s, and are more oppo&s;ite to the enter|taining of the Go&s;pel.</P>

<P>To Preach the acceptable Year of the Lord.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HERE is another Expre&s;&s;ion of the Service of Chri&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> to give No|tice of the acceptable Year of the Lord. This &s;eems to be an Allu&s;ion to the Proclaiming of the <HI>Year of Jubilee,</HI> &s;poken of, Lev. 25.9. <HI>Then thou &s;halt cau&s;e the Trum|pet of the Jubilee to Sound on the tenth Day of the &s;eventh Month.</HI></P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is to be under&s;tood by a Year?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>Sometimes a Year is taken properly for that time wherein the Sun is fullfilling its Cour&s;e,</HI> 365 <HI>Days.</HI> But &s;ometimes it is taken
<PB N="185" REF="001651_0184_0FB524A5D8C33BC0">
for an indefinite Time, be it longer or &s;horter. I&s;ai. 34.8. <HI>For it is the Day of the Lords Vengeance, and the Year of Vengeance for the Controver&s;ie of Zion.</HI> So a Day is &s;ome|times taken for an indifinite Time. I&s;ai. 2.12. <HI>For the Day of the Lord of Ho&s;ts &s;hall be upon every one that is Proud and Lofty.</HI></P>
<P>Q. <HI>Why is it &s;aid to be the acceptable Year of the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>Epiphanius takes it to be a Year wherein the Lord was acceptable unto Men, and &s;aith, That the fir&s;t Year of Chri&s;ts Mini&s;try was plea&s;ing, but afterwards they took Offence.</HI> But this is a Mi&s;take; for they took Offence this very Day. Luk. 4.28, 29. <HI>All that were in the Synagogue when they heard the&s;e things, were filled with Wrath, and and ro&s;e up and thru&s;t him out of the City, and led him unto the brow of the Hill whereon their City was Built, that they might ca&s;t him down Headlong.</HI> But the Meaning is, The Year of God's good Plea&s;ure and Favour, with the re&s;pect to the Preaching the Go&s;pel <HI>to the Poor, the healing the Broken-hearted,</HI> &amp;c. the clear Preaching of the Go&s;pel, and the &s;aving Efficacy of it.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE. <HI>There are &s;ome &s;pecial Sea|&s;ons wherein God doth in a remarkable Man|ner

revive Religion among his People.</HI> God doth not always carry on his Work in the Church in the &s;ame Proportion. As it is in Nature, there be great Vici&s;&s;itudes; there is Day and Night, Summer and Winter; the Moon Waxes and Wanes, the Sea Flows and Ebbs, and as it is in the civil State, there is a time of War and a time of Peace, times of Plenty and times of Scar|city, times of Health and times of Sickne&s;s, &s;o it is in the Church. There are &s;ome|times when the Hearts of Men are made hard. I&s;ai. 63.17. <HI>Why ha&s;t thou hardned our Hearts from thy Fear, and made us to Err from thy ways?</HI> So there be times wherein there is a plentiful Effu&s;ion of the Spirit of God, and Religion is in a more flouri&s;hing Con|dition. Math. 11.12. <HI>From the Days of John the Bapti&s;t, the Kingdom of Heaven &s;uffereth Violence, and the Violent take it by force.</HI> I&s;ai. 44.3. <HI>I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, &amp; my Ble&s;&s;ing on thy Off&s;pring.</HI> Ezek. 11.19. <HI>And I will give them one Heart, and I will put a new Spirit within you, and will take the Heart of Stone out of your Fle&s;h, and will give you an Heart of Fle&s;h.</HI> The like we have, Ezek. 36.26.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="001651_0186_0FB524ACD00E84F8">Q. <HI>How is it with a People when Reli|gion is revived?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>Saints are quickned.</HI> It contributes much to the flouri&s;hing of Religion, when Righteous Men flouri&s;h in Holine&s;s, as it is foretold, P&s;al. 92.12. <HI>The Righteous &s;hall flouri&s;h like a Palm-tree, they &s;hall grow like the Cedar in Lebanon.</HI> There be times of Temptation, when godly Men are in a flou|ri&s;hing Condition. Math 25.5. <HI>While the Bridegroom tarried, they all &s;lumbered and &s;lept.</HI> They grow Worldly, and Proud, and For|mal, and don't maintain much of the Life of Godline&s;s. And there be times when their Hearts are lifted up in the ways of God, as is &s;aid of <HI>Jeho&s;haphat,</HI> 2 Chron. 17.6. <HI>When the Weak are as David.</HI> When their Souls are in a pro&s;perous Condition, and they are in gracious Frames of Spirit, going on from <HI>Strength to Strength.</HI> Some|times they run the ways of God's Com|mandments, becau&s;e God enlarges their Hearts. P&s;al. 119.32. It is as with them, 2 The&s;. <HI>Your Faith groweth exceedingly, and the Charity of every one of you all towards each other aboundeth.</HI> This mightily increa&s;|eth Holine&s;s among a People.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sinners are Converted.</HI> God makes the
<PB N="188" REF="001651_0187_0FB524AEAFC6F8E8">
Go&s;pel at times to be very Powerful. So it was in the Primitive times, Rom. 15.29. <HI>I am &s;ure when I come unto you, I &s;hall come in the fullne&s;s of the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI> The Go&s;pel was written for the End <HI>that Men might believe and be &s;aved.</HI> Joh. 20.21. And it is preached for that End; and &s;ometimes God gives great Succe&s;s to it. Act. 26.18. <HI>I &s;end thee to open the blind Eyes, to turn them from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</HI> So <HI>John's</HI> Preaching was very much ble&s;&s;ed. Mal. 4.6. <HI>He &s;hall turn the Heart of the Fathers to the Children, and the Heart of the Children to their Fathers.</HI> This is Old and Young. There is a mighty Change wrought in a little Time: They that were Dead, are made Alive, and they that were Lo&s;t are Found. The Go&s;pel is made a <HI>&s;avour of Life to ma|ny.</HI> Sometimes there is great Complaint for want of this. P&s;al. 12.1. <HI>Help Lord, for the godly Man cea&s;eth; the Righteous fail from among the Children of Men.</HI> So I&s;ai. 53.1. <HI>Lord, who hath believed our Report? and to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</HI> At other times the Number of Saints is great|ly multiplyed. Act. 9.31. <HI>The Churches were edified, and walking in the fear of the
<PB N="189" REF="001651_0188_0FB524B173038648">
Lord, and the comfort of the Holy Gho&s;t were multiplyed.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Many that are not Converted, do become more Religious.</HI> When <HI>I&s;rael</HI> went out of <HI>E|gypt,</HI> there was a mixt Multitude that went with them. So when God is plea&s;ed to Con|vert a Number, there be many others that have a common Work of the Spirit on their Hearts; they are affected with their Con|dition, Reform their evil Manners, and en|gage in Religious Duties, and attain to con|&s;iderable Zeal, and are full of Religious Affections. So it was in Chri&s;t's time; there was great flocking about him. So by the Preaching of <HI>John</HI> many were affected. Luk. 3.10, 12, 14. <HI>The People &s;aid, What &s;hall we do? And the Publicans what &s;hall we do? And the Soldiers what &s;hall we do?</HI> When God works &s;avingly upon &s;ome, it is fre|quent that others have common Illumi|nations, whereby great Reformation is wrought, and the Reputation of Religion advanced, and People are di&s;po&s;ed to keep the external Covenant; and &s;o much Wrath is prevented.</P>
<P>Concerning this Work of God in reviv|ing Religion, you may ob&s;erve the&s;e Four Things.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="190" REF="001651_0189_0FB524B362B95BC8">1. Ob&s;ervation. <HI>This reviving is &s;ome|times more General and &s;ometimes more Par|ticular.</HI> It is more General, when it is throughout a Country, when in all Parts of a Land there is a turning to God. That was prophe&s;ied of, Ezek. 36.25, 26, 27. <HI>Then will I &s;prinkle clean Water upon you, &amp; ye &s;hall be clean from all your Filthine&s;s, and from all your Idols will I clean&s;e you,</HI> &amp;c. So it was about <HI>Luther's</HI> time, when &s;ome Nations broke off from <HI>Popery,</HI> and imbraced the Go&s;pel. Sometimes the Country doth ge|nerally Decline. Gal. 3.1. <HI>O Fooli&s;h Gala|tians, who hath bewitched you, that you &s;hould not obey the Truth?</HI> But &s;ometimes this re|viving is more Particular, when in &s;ome particular Towns Religion doth revive and flouri&s;h. So 2 The&s;. 1.3. <HI>Their Faith grew exceedingly.</HI> Rev. 3.8. <HI>Thou ha&s;t a little Strength, and ha&s;t kept my Word, and not de|nied my Name.</HI> At the &s;ame time <HI>Sardis</HI> and <HI>Laodicea</HI> were in a declining Way: As &s;ome|times it Rains upon one City, and doth not Rain upon another. Am. 4.7. So it is with God's Raining Righteou&s;ne&s;s. There is many times a great difference in the &s;ame Country; There is a Bla&s;t upon Corn in one part of a Land, when it flou|ri&s;hes in another: So it is in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="191" REF="001651_0190_0FB524B4E1B349F0">2. Ob&s;ervation. <HI>This reviving is &s;ometimes of longer, and &s;ometimes of &s;horter Continuance.</HI> Sometimes Religion flouri&s;hes in a Coun|try for a great many Years together. So it did for twenty nine Years in the Days of <HI>Hezekiah.</HI> 2 Chron. 29.1. So when God pours out his Spirit, &s;ometimes the Work continues many Years. It began in <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t's</HI> time, and continued &s;everal Years after the Death of Chri&s;t. Math. 11.12. <HI>From the Days of John the Bapti&s;t until now, the Kingdom of Heaven &s;uffereth Vio|lence.</HI> Compare this with Joh. 5.25. <HI>The time is coming, and now is, when the Dead &s;hall hear the Voice of the Son of God and live.</HI> But &s;ometimes it is for a le&s;s &s;pace. We have rea&s;on to think that there was much of the converting Pre&s;ence of God in <HI>Co|rinth</HI> for the &s;pace of a Year and half. Act. 18.9, 10. Sometimes it is not &s;o long.

There is a &s;tated time for the ri&s;ing of the Sun, and for the &s;etting of the &s;ame, and &s;o for the return of the Spring; but the returns of the Spi|rit are very Arbitrary. Sometimes God puts his People to wait longer for them; &s;ome|times not &s;o long: It is in this Ca&s;e, as it is with the inward Con&s;olations of godly Men. God takes his own time to Refre&s;h their Hearts, and Seal them up to the Day of Redemption. No Man can tell before|hand when the Work of God &s;hall Pro&s;per in this or that Place. Act. 1.6, 7. <HI>It is not for you to know the Times and the Sea&s;ons that the Father has put in his own Power.</HI> When God hardens a People, none can tell how long that &s;hall be.

and &s;ome have obtained Mercy; and at &s;uch times there be a Number of &s;en&s;ele&s;s Sinners, that are not concerned about their Souls, that mind nothing el&s;e but the World and their carnal Delights, while &s;ome are crying out, <HI>What &s;hall we do to be &s;aved.</HI> They are enquiring <HI>what they &s;hall Eat, and what they &s;hall Drink, and wherewithal they &s;hall be Cloathed.</HI> Such a Spirit is Doleful at any time, much more at &s;uch a time when then there be a cloud of Witne&s;&s;es, a great many good Examples. They have as much need to &s;eek as others; they have provok|ed God as much as others; they are as near the Grave as others.

Maturity of their Judgment. But it looks more Darkly, when at &s;uch a time, Per|&s;ons that are grown to Mens and Womens E&s;tates, are not thoughtful of their eternal Condition, when many of their Standing are going towards Heaven. For them to be going towards Hell, it looks Awfully upon them, as if God did de&s;ign to ca&s;t them off. When God makes the Arrows of his Word pierce the Hearts of others, and &s;uffers them to flie over their Heads, it has a look as if God had no de&s;ign of Mercy to them. Math. 24.40. <HI>Then &s;hall two be in the Field, one &s;hall be taken and the other left.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When they have been overlooked formerly at &s;uch a time.</HI> Some of the&s;e Men have &s;een &s;uch Days formerly over and again. When others have been flowing to the goodne&s;s of God, God has made many to pre&s;s into the Kingdom of Heaven, but they have not partook of that Mercy. The Prophet told him, 2 Kin. 7.2. <HI>Behold, thou &s;halt &s;ee it with thine Eyes, but thou &s;halt not Eat there|of.</HI> So it hath been with the&s;e Men; the Opportunities have pa&s;&s;ed over, others have &s;tepped in and been healed when the Waters were troubled; but the&s;e have not been healed. If it &s;hould be &s;o again,
<PB N="203" REF="001651_0202_0FB4E3731075A368">
there would appear very little hopes of them. If all the Arrows are &s;uffered to flie over their Heads, their Condition is ex|ceeding Dangerous. It is not very often that there is a great &s;tirring of the Spirit in one particular Town, and if Men have been overlooked twice or thrice at &s;uch times, it is much to be feared what will be|come of them.
