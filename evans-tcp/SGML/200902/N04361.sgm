<P>ALTHO' Human Learning is not e&s;teemed an e&s;&s;ential Qualifi|cation to a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;|pel by the Society of which the Author of the en&s;uing &s;mall Treati&s;e became a Member and Mini&s;ter, yet ina&s;much as it is e&s;teemed &s;o by &s;ome of other Chri&s;tian Societies, the &s;aid Treati&s;e may be better accepted of &s;uch, when they are acquainted that he was a Scholar, which to &s;hew, plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that <Q>He was one trained up to Lite|rature,

When he had fini&s;hed his Cour&s;e there, he was ordain'd a Prie&s;t of the Church of England, and a cer|tain great Man took him to be his Chaplain; and afterwards he got a Living at <HI>Lydd,</HI> worth about <HI>two Hundred</HI> Pounds a Year. But after having been thus employ'd &s;ome time, he came to &s;ee that <HI>Infant Bapti&s;m</HI> was an human In&s;titution, and to <HI>preach</HI> for Wages unlawful.&mdash;And becoming in time more and more unea&s;y to go on in Acting what was burthen&s;om to his Con&s;cience, he re&s;olved to de&s;i&s;t from his Mini&s;try, and &s;o he went to the Bi&s;hop and delivered up the Com|mi&s;&s;ion that he had received from him to preach; and ca&s;ting him&s;elf upon God's Providence, he took a Farm and turn'd Gra&s;ier, by which Means he maintained his Wife and Children

<P>OUR Te&s;timony, and that Truth to which we bear Te&s;timony, who by tho&s;e to whom Woe is, fora&s;much as they tremble not at the Word of God, are &s;cornfully &s;tiled <HI>Quakers,</HI> is no different Thing, nor another, but plainly one and altogether-the &s;ame, which all the Holy Men and Prophets of God have held forth, as al&s;o CHRIST him&s;elf and all his Apo&s;tles and Mini&s;ters, as many as have &s;poken as they were moved of God from the beginning of the World to this very Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. For even as they (who&s;e Te&s;ti|mony who even few or none either be|lieved or received) &s;o we, who are of her Children, of all and only whom Wi&s;dom is ju&s;tified, give Te&s;timony to Wi&s;dom it&s;elf, not the Wi&s;dom of this World, nor of the Princes of this World,

<P N="3">3. Concerning which <HI>Light</HI> CHRIST him&s;elf &s;aid to <HI>Paul,</HI> being now truly Converted to it, which he per&s;ecuted be|fore, through the blindne&s;s of his Mind, <HI>I now &s;end thee to the Nations, to open their Eyes and turn them from Darkne&s;s to Light, from the Power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgivene&s;s of Sins, and Inheritance among them which are &s;anctified by Faith that is in me.</HI> Acts, 26.17, 18.</P>
<P N="4">4. Neither was this the Bu&s;ine&s;s and Mini&s;try which <HI>Paul</HI> only receiv'd of God, that he might fulfil it; but <HI>John</HI> al&s;o te&s;tifies, that this was the Me&s;&s;age
<PB N="9" REF="005393_0008_101733188CFEE780">which he, together with the re&s;t of CHRIST'S Mini&s;ters, had received from CHRIST him&s;elf, to declare, which was al&s;o from the Beginning, not any new Thing, (however it might &s;eem new, as being clouded till the Darkne&s;s was pa&s;t, and the true Light &s;hined again out of the Darkne&s;s that &s;ometime clouded it) but the old Thing, which was from the Beginning, namely, <HI>That God is Light, and in him is no Darkne&s;s at all, and that if we &s;ay we have Fellow|&s;hip with him, and walk in Darkne&s;s, we lye and do not the Truth; but if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have mutual Fellow&s;hip with him, and the Blood of</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>his Son, clean&s;eth us from all Sin,</HI> 1 John 1.5, 6, 7.

<P N="5">5. Concerning which <HI>Light of God,</HI> of which the Scripture every were &s;peak|eth, and from which enlightning the Penmen thereof, the Scripture it&s;elf was given forth, which al&s;o was, which al&s;o &s;hined in the Heart of Man long before
<PB N="10" REF="005393_0009_101732E775DFDAD8">the Scriptures were; we, together with the Scripture and the Writers there|of, do te&s;tify this &s;elf &s;ame Thing, namely, That a certain Mea&s;ure, certain Beams were of old, and now are given of God, in the Con&s;cience of every of them, to the Sons of Men, who altho' God made them after his own Image, upright and blamele&s;s, have yet &s;ought out to them&s;elves both various and vain Inventions, and corrupted their Ways and erred: And as to any help they can have from them&s;elves, are in a Manner wholy peri&s;ned from the true God, and <HI>from the Knowledge of him, whom truly to know is Life eternal,</HI> and from all Communion with him, to &s;hine in their dark Hearts as a Light in a Dark Place, and to bring them back through the Con|demnation of their evil Deeds, Words, and Thoughts, and of that whole Chaos of Confu&s;ion and Corruption that came in by the Fall, which Con|demnation this Light will bring on all that take good heed to it and through the Mortification of that old Man and Body, as well of Death as Sin, with
<PB N="11" REF="005393_0010_1017331D1F6DDE30">all its earthly Members; and in a Word, of all whatever in Man is contrary to the Image and Will of God, and turn them back unto God, unto that <HI>primitive State</HI> of <HI>Purity, Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>In|nocency,</HI> from which they departed to wor&s;hip Images in their own Imagination, to know and to wor&s;hip the true God, who is a <HI>Spirit,</HI> truly <HI>in Spirit and in Truth,</HI> with which Wor&s;hip only the Lord is wor&s;hipped according to his Will; and la&s;tly, to enjoy &s;uch &s;piri|tual Peace and Communion with him, as none are by any Means po&s;&s;ible (as is afore&s;aid) capable of, while they are alienated from him by the <HI>Darkne&s;s of Iniquity,</HI> and while they remain in their <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion incorrigible</HI> and <HI>unconverted.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Rom. 3, 6, 9, 19. <HI>For both Jew and Gentiles</HI> (as it is written) <HI>are concluded all under Sin, there is not one Righteous, no not one; there is none that under&s;tand|eth, there is none that &s;eeketh after God, they are all gone out of the Way, they are altogether become unprofitable, there is none that doeth Good, no not one; their Throat is an open Sepulchre, with their Tongues
<PB N="12" REF="005393_0011_101732E900307258">they have uttered Deceit, the Poy&s;on of A&s;ps is under their Lips, their Mouth is full of Cur&s;ing and Bitterne&s;s, their Feet is &s;wift to &s;hed Blood, Wa&s;ting and Mi&s;e|ry is in their Way, and the Way of Peace they have not known, there is no Fear of God before their Eyes. So that every Mouth is &s;topped and the whole World be|come guilty before God, for all have &s;inned and fallen &s;hort of the Glory of God.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. This is the State of all Mankind &s;e|parated by the <HI>Fall</HI> from the <HI>Light</HI> into the <HI>Darkne&s;s,</HI> among whom even all of what&s;oever Sex, Nation, Language, Condition or Age (at lea&s;t that is capa|ble to di&s;cern between Good and Evil) I &s;ay, all may &s;ay within them&s;elves, We are lo&s;t, we are gone down head|long into the utmo&s;t Darkne&s;s, into ex|tream Damnation from God: Neither is there any other way to Life exhibited, but by JESUS CHRIST the <HI>Light of the World,</HI> by &s;ome Mea&s;ure of <HI>Light</HI> at lea&s;t &s;hining from him&s;elf, <HI>enlightning</HI> (as it's &s;aid) <HI>every Man that comes into the World, &s;hining in Darkne&s;s,</HI> in the dark Con&s;ciences of Men, <HI>though the

<P N="8">8. In this Manner therefore is CHRIST the <HI>Salvation of the World,</HI> as he is the <HI>Light of the World,</HI> de&s;troying the Works of the Devil, who hath wrought in the Darkne&s;s to the &s;etting up of a <HI>Principa|lity</HI> and a <HI>Kingdom to him&s;elf</HI> in the Hearts of Men, and redeeming Men from the Power of the Prince of the Darkne&s;s of this World unto God, who

<P N="9">9. In like manner doth the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> affirm <HI>CHRIST to be given of God for a Covenant to the People for a Light to the Nations, to open the blind Eyes, and to bring out of Pri&s;on them that &s;it in Darkne&s;s, even the Blind, which have Eyes and &s;ee not,</HI> I&s;a. 42.6, &amp;c. And after him <HI>Paul</HI> te&s;tifyeth, that <HI>Chri&s;t was &s;et as a Light to the Nations, that he might be the Lords Salvation to the Ends of the Earth. Simion</HI> al&s;o &s;peaking by the holy Spirit of the Child JESUS, call him that <HI>Salvation of his which the Lord had prepared before the Face of all People, to be a Light to lighten the Nations and the Glory of his People</HI> I&s;rael, Luke 2.30.</P>
<P N="10">10. In as much therefore as CHRIST is the <HI>Light of the World,</HI> he is the <HI>Saviour of the World,</HI> and &s;o far only are men &s;aved by him as they believe in him, who is the <HI>Light,</HI> and in that <HI>Light</HI> where with he doth <HI>enlighten</HI> e|very Man, in his own Con&s;cience, and
<PB N="15" REF="005393_0014_10173321A20CA4F0">&s;et them&s;elves to walk after it, which leads no Man into Iniquity; and &s;o far forth are all Men liable to Condem|nation before God, as they walk not in this, which is in them, howbeit, not con&s;enting to any, but te&s;tifying again&s;t all Iniquity, even the lea&s;t, and al&s;o re|proving and condemning it, even in them, who are not in it, but walking contrary to it in the <HI>Darkne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. For altho' God in his great Love gave his Son for a <HI>Light,</HI> not that he might <HI>damn the World,</HI> but that <HI>the World through him might be &s;av'd;</HI> and he that <HI>believeth in him is not condemned,</HI> yet he <HI>that believes not is condemned already;</HI> and <HI>this is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World,</HI> into the inmo&s;t Con&s;ciences of Men, their manife&s;ting Good and Evil, <HI>but Men loved the Dark|ne&s;s rather than the Light, becau&s;e their Deeds are evil; for he that doth evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, le&s;t his Deeds &s;hould be reproved; but who&s;o doth Truth, he cometh to the Light, that his deeds may be made Ma|nife&s;t,

<P N="12">12. And altho' all that obtain <HI>Ju&s;|tification,</HI> are <HI>ju&s;tified freely,</HI> by the <HI>Grace of the Lord,</HI> through the <HI>Redemp|tion</HI> that is made in JESUS CHRIST a|lone, (yea cur&s;ed be he, and cur&s;ed will he be, that &s;eeks for <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> any otherway; for he who is the <HI>Light of the World,</HI> is al&s;o that corner Stone which (however it be &s;et at naught by a thou&s;and thou&s;and, of the Builders) is yet made the Head of the Corner; neither is there Salvation in any other, nor is there any other Name &s;ave that of CHRIST the Light, under Heaven given among Men, whereby they mu&s;t be &s;aved, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.11, 12. Neverthele&s;s no further is any Man accepted of God, or ju&s;tified by CHRIST, or the Grace of God in CHRIST, then as he is directed by CHRIST the <HI>Light,</HI> and is by the Grace of God, by that <HI>inward Witne&s;s</HI> of God, by the <HI>Light</HI> of God and CHRIST in his Con&s;cience, which is given of God for this very End, that it may teach and lead, taught and
