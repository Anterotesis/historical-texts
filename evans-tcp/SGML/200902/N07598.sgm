<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IN making the tour of <HI>Europe</HI> I had the plea&s;ure of writing to you la&s;t from <HI>Belgrade</HI> the Capital of <HI>Hungary;</HI> I have &s;ince had the curio&s;ity, (before I enter <HI>Poland</HI>) to vi&s;it <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> a Pro|vince formerly under the Dominion of the <HI>Turk,</HI> but now belonging to the <HI>Emperor</HI> of <HI>Germany;</HI> and as its <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Waywode, the name given to the Prince or Governor.</NOTE> <HI>Waywode</HI> is almo&s;t independant of his Sovereign, he has peopled it with Per&s;ons of all Nations, and of every profe&s;&s;ion under Heaven.</P>
<P>Having made a purcha&s;e of the &s;oil from the Barbarians, who were the original Proprietors; he has al&s;o obtain'd a grant from the <HI>Emperor</HI> to him and his Heirs, for being perpetual <HI>Waywode</HI> of the Country: This enables him, together with his great di&s;tance from Court, to govern the In|habitants, who flocked from all Quarters to &s;et|tle the Country under the &s;anction of a Charter of Privileges and immunities, granted for the pre&s;ervation of their Religion and Liberties, with an ab&s;olute &s;way.</P>
<P>In ancient times the Natives and Foreigners lived in perfect friend&s;hip; but within the&s;e ten years pa&s;t, there has been nothing but bloody Wars carried on between them.&mdash;The original cau&s;e of
<PB N="3" REF="009701_0003_0F7786A4784BED20">
which is &s;aid to be, the <HI>Waywode's</HI> taking the advantage of the &s;implicity and ignorance of the Natives in purcha&s;ing their Lands, with regard to their nature and &s;ituation, as well as de&s;cription; and cheating them out of ten times more than ever they &s;old. This, (with the trade driven on among them by &s;ome Chri&s;tians, who fir&s;t made them drunk, and then defrauded them, and pro|&s;tituted their Females,&mdash;a Sy&s;tem of religion un|known to them and their Forefathers) di&s;gu&s;ted them to &s;uch a degree, that they immediately de|clared War. The <HI>Turks</HI> joining them, there was then a nece&s;&s;ity for the <HI>Waywode</HI> and his Subjects to rai&s;e money. The Delegates being a&s;&s;embled to con&s;ult the welfare of the Country; in&s;i&s;ted that a Tax &s;hou'd be laid upon all the Cow-kine in the Province. The <HI>Waywode</HI> agreed, but up|on condition, that all his own &s;hou'd be exempted, as he had large flocks all over the Country&mdash; This, the Delegates refus'd, becau&s;e his Cows were as liable to be made a prey of by the Enemy, as their own. He then told them his Bulls were free from Taxes, as they could not come under the denomination of Cow-kine, but Bull-kine; this con|&s;truction however the Delegates wou'd not admit of. A long di&s;pute then en&s;ued. His Excellency told them that if Bulls &s;hou'd be taxed, which he cou'd not believe was ju&s;t, yet certainly Heffers and Calves of all kinds were clear. The Delegates reply'd, they &s;aw no rea&s;on why his Excellency's Bulls, Heffers and Calves &s;hou'd be exempted and not their own. The Barbarians in the mean time, laid wa&s;te the Frontiers with fire and &s;word.
<PB N="4" REF="009701_0004_0F7786A511608838">
This inte&s;tine di&s;pute prov'd more fatal to the Province, than all the depredations of a foreign Enemy. Such was the cruel, unrelenting di&s;po|&s;ition of the Lord of the &s;oil, that he wou'd rather &s;ee a general Ma&s;&s;acre of all the Inhabitants of the Land, than &s;uffer one of his calves to be taxed towards protecting them from a foreign force.</P>
<P>A few of the well affected Natives to the Go|vernment, threw them&s;elves under it's protection, and deliver'd up their Wives and Children as a pledge of their future Fidelity; Lands were a&s;|&s;ign'd for the maintainance of &s;ome, and others were &s;upported at the public-expence near the Metrapolis. Such was the &s;tate of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania</HI> upon my fir&s;t arrival at the Capital.</P>
<P>I waited upon his Excellency the <HI>Waywode,</HI> who receiv'd me very politely. He appear'd to be a middle-aged Man of &s;mall &s;tature; &s;urrounded with half a Dozen boys who were called Prime Mini&s;|ters of State; four young Nymps of Circa&s;&s;ian breed, and a Calidonian wry necked Mu&s;ician. The Room was filled with in&s;truments of mu&s;ic. A Violin; a harp&s;ichord; &s;ix Bagpipes, and one dozen of Jews Harps, He enquired if I under|&s;tood Mu&s;ick; I an&s;wer'd, &s;ome few Italian Airs upon the Bagpipe. Joy then appear'd upon his countenance, and he immediately gave me a ge|neral invitation to accompany him either to the cha&s;e (as he lov'd a bow and arrow) or concert, e|very day during my &s;tay at <HI>Wei&s;&s;enburgh.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce had two days elap&s;ed, when the City was all in arms, at the news of the Pi&s;s&mdash;Brute&mdash; tarians (a bigotted, cruel and revengful &s;ect, &s;prung
<PB N="5" REF="009701_0005_0F7786A743D70840">
from the Turks, and Adorers of <HI>Mahomet</HI> as to ab&s;olute Fate, but nominal Chri&s;tians in &s;ome other re&s;pects, having murder'd the innocent Na|tives, Man Woman and Child, who were &s;ettled in the Country, were in full march to butcher tho&s;e under the protection of the City. In con|&s;equence of this intelligence, eight hundred men were put under arms, and ten pieces of cannon prepar'd. A Truce however en&s;ued, and the <HI>Way|wode,</HI> not only put up with the in&s;ult, but mean|ly &s;toop'd to carre&s;s the, rebels; nay, he promis'd them an act of Indemnity, and engag'd to take them into high favor, if they wou'd turn their re&s;entment upon the Delegates of the Province, in&s;tead of him&s;elf. This they agreed to. The Delegates had no way to &s;ave them&s;elves from de&s;truction, and pre&s;erve the Government from Anarchy; but by appealing to the <HI>Emperor</HI> to be taken under his own protection, and re&s;cued from the oppre&s;&s;ions of the Pi&s;s&mdash;Brute&mdash;tarians, and the Tyranny of the <HI>Waywode.</HI> By this &s;trange revolution at Court, all that were Rebels but a few days before, were now the Court Favorites; and tho&s;e, who had bravely and generou&s;ly taken up arms to &s;ave his Excellency's wind-pipe from being &s;ever'd in a thou&s;and pieces, were look'd upon as Enemies to the Government. Such is the in&s;tability of Courts, and the wonderful Wi&s;|dom of Mini&s;ters of State! It is &s;aid his Excellen|cy's Mu&s;ical In&s;truments in the fray were all put out of tune, and that he has been di&s;concerted ever &s;ince; be that as it will; a &s;udden re&s;olu|tion was taken to call a Council, wherein it was
<PB N="6" REF="009701_0006_0F7786A7A9C54C60">
decreed, that there &s;hou'd no Magi&s;trates hold Commi&s;&s;ions under the Government, who had &s;hewn any Love for the <HI>Emperor;</HI> or was not a Pi&s;s&mdash;Brute&mdash;tarian; or cou'd not play upon the Jew's harp.</P>
<P>As I had the happine&s;s to be acquainted with Coun&s;ellor Wi&s;eman, a mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Gen|tleman, who had directed the Board for ten Years, with the greate&s;t integrity through all the political &s;torms and tempe&s;ts that had threatened the de|&s;truction of the Province, during the whole time by rea&s;on of a bloody war that had been carried on with the grand <HI>Turk,</HI> he took the fir&s;t Oppor|tunity after the Council broke up to communicate to me the &s;ub&s;tance of the debate upon that im|portant &s;ubject.</P>
<P>His Excellency the <HI>Waywode,</HI> inform'd the Board, that he wou'd not have one A&s;&s;ertorian in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the peace or any other civil office throughout the Government, as they &s;eem'd all tinctur'd with a rebellious di&s;po&s;ition towards him and his family, and had transferr'd their Loyalty to the Emperor him&s;elf. That by their late proceedings, in choo&s;ing &s;uch men to repre|&s;ent them, who were his bitter Enemies; and in complaining to the Emperor again&s;t him, by which means he wou'd be look'd upon with an evil Eye at the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and either oblig'd to re&s;ign his Government, or throw him&s;elf under the Pro|tection of the grand <HI>Turk;</HI> therefore as they had thus &s;hewn their malicious intentions again&s;t his Admini&s;tration they were no longer to be enrol|led among the Number of his Friends. He al&s;o
<PB N="7" REF="009701_0007_0F7786A868F29310">
added, that tho&s;e of the <HI>Emperors</HI>' Religion had behav'd in &s;uch a cold indifferent manner (a few in Wei&s;&s;enburgh excepted) as plainly made it appear that they were as well affected to the <HI>Emperor</HI> as him&s;elf;&mdash;that their principles in Religion and the maxims by which they and their Ance&s;tors were govern'd for one Thou&s;and Years, were pecu|liarly adapted to &s;upport the <HI>Emperial Family;</HI>&mdash; that the&s;e things being con&s;ider'd, he cou'd not expect their firm attachment to his per&s;on, or their general concurrence to his mea|&s;ures; and therefore in good policy they ought not to be tru&s;ted at &s;uch a critical conjuncture. He therefore de&s;ir'd the Council to give their opinions, whether any other Sect was to be tru&s;ted as Ma|gi&s;trates in the Government, be&s;ides the Pi&s;s&mdash; Brute&mdash;tarians, a Sect who&s;e principles have ever been diametrically oppo&s;ite to Monarchy; and not only <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This has reference to their &s;olomn Leauge and Covenant.</NOTE> <HI>&s;worn</HI> Enemies to the <HI>Emperial</HI> Family, but murder'd one of the <HI>Emperors</HI> before his own palace; and have always been the foremo&s;t in all the Rebellions that have been rais'd again&s;t his Suc|ce&s;&s;ors ever &s;ince. He al&s;o &s;aid, that there was a few of his Enemies, who have dared publickly to e&s;pou&s;e the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s cau&s;e, and whom he "mark'd" out for puni&s;hment; he wi&s;h'd it cou'd be with the lo&s;s of their heads, in&s;tead of their Commi&s;&s;ions. The Enemies were <HI>Pottonius, Paulinus, Mortonus,</HI> and <HI>Trumponius,</HI> the la&s;t he was &s;omewhat &s;orry for, as he &s;uppos'd his Ance&s;tors were great Mu|&s;icians; for they had taken a name, to perpetuate their po&s;terity, by which, &s;ome Nations call a Jews-Harp.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="009701_0008_0F7786A8D3E37610">The Generality for the Council heartily concurr'd with his Excellency the <HI>Waywode;</HI> but when it came to Coun&s;ellor <HI>Wi&s;eman</HI> to give his opinion, he beg'd leave to di&s;&s;ent from the re&s;t of the board; and hoped his Excellency, wou'd, with that attention and deliberation for which he was remarkable, hearken to his rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>He told his Excellency, he hoped he wou'd ex|cu&s;e him, if he differ'd with him in &s;ome of the Political Ob&s;ervations he had ju&s;t now made; and unto which Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Simpleton, Prigg, Beau,</HI> and <HI>Brainle&s;s</HI> his Brother Coun&s;ellors had &s;ignified their approbation. He told him that as he had been but a &s;hort time <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of the province he ought to u&s;e every method in his power to culti|vate a good under&s;tanding with the people;&mdash; that as a &s;pirit of Freedom had drawn them from all Nations to populate &s;uch an exten&s;ive province, &s;tripping them of their rights and privileges, was not the way of either gaining the good opinion of tho&s;e who were wavering, or of bringing them back that were the mo&s;t &s;editious; that tho' his Ex|cellency was &s;en&s;ible, how little either him&s;elf, or the Council troubled them&s;elves about what was called Religion, yet (as he very well knew] there was a nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up external appearances, and that it was a u&s;eful engine to keep the Vulgar in awe;&mdash;that if therefore he abandoned the profe&s;&s;ion of it, he wou'd be held in univer&s;al, di&s;e&s;teem by all its Profe&s;&s;ors;&mdash;that if he ap|peard more zealous for one &s;ect than another, a general Jealou&s;y wou'd take place among the re&s;t, and perhaps unite them all again&s;t him; that if
<PB N="9" REF="009701_0009_0F7786A9974D6888">
this &s;hou'd happen; the Pi&s;s&mdash;Brute&mdash;tarians, were not the tenth of his Subjects, and con&s;equently cou'd not &s;upport him again&s;t the other nine;&mdash;that if he made an impartial di&s;|tribution of places of Profit and Honor in the Government, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd them in all their e|quitable demands, the <HI>Emperor</HI> wou'd have no ob|jection towards the continuing of him in his <HI>Vice-Royality;</HI> no complaints cou'd have any weight again&s;t him, his Character wou'd appear fair at Court, and perhaps &s;ave him the expence and trouble of a long Journey to defend him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>A&s;&s;ertorians,</HI> the taking them into his favor, in imitation of many of his worthy Prede|ce&s;&s;ors, wou'd perhaps, effectually regain their Friend&s;hip; make them drop the pro&s;ecution of their Appeal; and as they are above one fifth part of the Inhabitants, they are no contemptable body to di&s;oblige. <HI>Pottonius,</HI> (who appears to be particularly &s;ingled out) is a Gentleman, who has remarkably di&s;tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf this twenty Years pa&s;t, for his Integrity, in faithfully di&s;|charging the Office of a Magi&s;trate; his fortune places him above the fear or affection of Mankind, in the de&s;tribution of Ju&s;tice; and therefore he does your Excellency as much honor in ac|cepting of the Commi&s;&s;ion, as you can do him in giving it. As to tho&s;e of the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Religion, it is well known that two of their Prie&s;ts; and a number of their People, who either hold Offices in reality under you, or live in expectation of them, in this Metrapolis, have gone greater
<PB N="10" REF="009701_0010_0F7786AA54A40EC0">
lengths to &s;erve you, than any other Sect among us in &s;ome particulars.</P>
<P>Have they not abandoned their former Princi|ples; violated every obligation that was either civil or &s;acred, or that bound them by the ties of Con&s;cience or honor to be faithful to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> in order to &s;upport your Cau&s;e? Have they not pro&s;tituted their Temple, (a place &s;olemnly de|dicated for pious u&s;es) as an Amphitheatre for the Rabble to combat in? Has not their Altar been profaned by the unhallowed hands of Turks, Jews, Infidels and Pi&s;s&mdash;Brute&mdash;tarians? And all this in favor of your Excellency.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Paulinus, Mortonus,</HI> and others of the <HI>Emperor's</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion, who&s;e characters have been irreproachable, and who&s;e Virtues have made them rever'd by their Country, &s;hall they become the objects of your Excellency's di&s;approbation for no other rea&s;on, than that they &s;till continue to have a regard for the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and cannot ea|&s;ily conquer their old prejudices in favour of the Emperial Court?&mdash;Time might bring them over as well as others; but &s;uch ra&s;h and precipitate mea&s;ures, will create a Jealou&s;y throughout all <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> as if your oppo&s;ition to them was purely out of &s;pite to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> for whom they wou'd be made a Sacrifice.</P>
<P>Your Attachment to the Pi&s;s&mdash;Brute&mdash;tarians is &s;omewhat remarkable, as they have been the cau&s;e of all the trouble that has happen'd in the Government. Had there never been a Rebellion among&s;t them here, your Excellency wou'd ne|ver

have been brought into &s;uch difficulties. Had the Traitors been puni&s;h'd according to their De|merit, there never wou'd have been an Appeal to <HI>Vienna.</HI> How then can you place your chief con|fidence in a &s;ect who have been the &s;ole cau&s;e of your misfortunes? The&s;e invincible arguments &s;tagger'd his Excellency; but being a Man of weak Intellects, and abandon'd (like <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The la&s;t King of the A&s;&s;yrian Empire, who for his Ex|tream Effeminacy was &s;o di&s;dain'd by his own Captains, that they con&s;pired again&s;t him. When he &s;aw him&s;elf &s;o &s;trait|ned, that there was no e&s;caping, he turned valiant, and making a funeral pile of all his precious Things (Fiddles) he burnt him&s;elf in his Palace, and went out in a blaze.</P> <BIBL>See a full account of him in Ju&s;tin.</BIBL></NOTE> <HI>Sardana palus</HI>) to wine, mu&s;ick and Women, was &s;oon confirm'd in his former opinion, by his other Coun&s;ellors, who told him, that all the People in the Province were a &s;et of Villains, but the Pi&s;s&mdash;Brute&mdash;tarians and them&s;elves, and hop'd he wou'd govern him&s;elf accordingly. Thus the Council broke up. But I am afraid I have tran&s;|gre&s;s'd the bounds of a &s;ingle Letter, and have only tired your patience with &s;ome few hints about the Politicks of a Country, the name of which is &s;carcely known in <HI>America.</HI> You &s;ee by this how I improve my time in my Travels, and I hope to return to <HI>America</HI> equally accom|pli&s;h'd with tho&s;e of my Countrymen who have made this Tour before me. Adieu, dear Sir, at pre&s;ent! You need not expect to hear from me,
