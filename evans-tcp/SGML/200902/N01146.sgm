on the Grand&s;on, <HI>Eno&s;h,</HI> of whom little more is Reported but this, <HI>And he Died.</HI> Indeed one thing more is in the Report; which is by &s;ome thus tran&s;lated; <HI>Then began to be Profaned the Name of the Lord.</HI> This Per&s;on Lived, it &s;eems, to &s;ee much <HI>Profanity</HI> and <HI>Aposta&s;y</HI> to gain upon a Sin|ful World.

Yea, &s;ome read it, <HI>Then began Preaching in the Name of the Lord;</HI> The Hebrew word, (from whence comes the Greek word for <HI>Preaching,</HI>) favours it.

<HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Vexation</HI> which every day be|fals every man, there is Enough and E|nough to Ju&s;tify &s;uch a Denomination.

Thirdly, It is the Fate of a <HI>Man</HI> to be &s;oon <HI>Forgotten;</HI> he appears a very little while, and it is quickly <HI>Forgotten,</HI> that ever he was in the World.
