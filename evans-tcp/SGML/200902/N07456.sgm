<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author had no de&s;ign originally of publi&s;h|ing the following di&s;cour&s;e, but a petition having been pre&s;ented to the Presbytery, de&s;iring their opinion, whether Dr. Watts's p&s;almody might with &s;afety be u&s;ed in the churches: and the Pre&s;|bytery having appointed him to give his &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject; and &s;everal per&s;ons who heard it, having earne&s;tly de|&s;ired it might be printed, urging, that it would be of u&s;e to ma|ny &s;erious enquirers: de&s;irous to &s;erve the be&s;t intere&s;t of man|kind, he &s;ends it abroad into the world.</P>
<P>He will, probably, be cen&s;ured, by readers who have not been tea&s;ed with this controver&s;y as a tautological trifler, with|out this apology, that many of tho&s;e he had chiefly in view, having imbibed from their youth, a &s;et of contracted &s;entiments on this head, and for want of better information were &s;urprizing|ly bigoted to their notions, &s;uppo&s;ing it criminal to &s;ing any other &s;ongs of prai&s;e to God, but <HI>Rou&s;e's ver&s;ion</HI> of <HI>David's p&s;alms;</HI> and being full of objections, which tho&s;e of better im|provements would judge too trifling to de&s;erve an an&s;wer: the author thought fit to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to remove their &s;cruples, by <HI>line upon line, line upon line, and precept upon precept, precept upon precept.</HI></P>
<P>He is &s;en&s;ible there are many pious and worthy mini&s;ters and private chri&s;tians who con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;cruple to &s;ing any other than the old ver&s;ion; and while this is the ca&s;e they &s;hould not be mole&s;ted. Whether they are incapable of throwing off the prejudices of education &s;o as to examine the matter fairly; or have not had opportunity enough to examine and compare evan|gelical compo&s;itions with that they u&s;e; or imagine, that that alone is of divine appointment, and therefore to be continued in the church through all its vici&s;&s;itudes and improvements; or that
<PB N="4" REF="009524_0003_0F76EC2802C05C68">
it was compo&s;ed by <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf; therefore to u&s;e any other would be to oppo&s;e a human to a divine compo&s;ure; or what ever el&s;e may determine them: the Author is very far from judg|ing them, or patronizing the narrow &s;entiments of &s;uch as would make the &s;inging of either a term of communion, or an ad|herence to either a mark of grace; nor would he embroil con|gregations or families; but join with either, rather than &s;pread the fire of contention where there is a majority zealou&s;ly attached to either: he heartily wi&s;hes that &s;uch wretched bigotry were dead and buried, never to ri&s;e again.</P>
<P>His de&s;ign is to introduce more of the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel into chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, and mo&s;t earne&s;tly recommends it to all con|cerned, to exerci&s;e that tenderne&s;s, forbearance and charity, that is the ornament of the chri&s;tian character; and to u&s;e no o|ther than the gentle arts of rea&s;on and per&s;ua&s;ion, till with the mo&s;t cordial union of hearts and voices, we all join in &s;ongs to the <HI>Lamb,</HI> that wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his blood.</P>
<P>That the divine ble&s;&s;ing may render the following di&s;cour&s;e very &s;erviceable to thy immortal intere&s;t, is the prayer of,</P>

<P>&mdash;I will &s;ing with the &s;pirit, and I will &s;ing with the under&s;tanding al&s;o.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_AMID all the variety of objects that engage the attention of mankind, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> important as vital religion: and no <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the braven-born religion of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to celebrate the divine perfections, which are di&s;played in creation, providence, and the redemption of lo&s;t &s;inners, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ongs of rap|turous devotion. To &s;ing the prai&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> of God, is &s;o much the dictate of nature, that it has <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of all religions, true and fal&s;e: the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Barbarians</HI> made it a part of their wor|&s;hip to their deities: and thought its original &s;o heavenly, that they a&s;cribed the invention of it to their gods.</P>
<P>But how much more exalted is it under the influence and re|finements of the chri&s;tian religion? It animates, refines, and exalts the &s;oul; and throws off the load that hangs heavy upon it. When we are &s;illed with divine thankfulne&s;s, the mo&s;t pious affections naturally vent them&s;elves this way, according to the divine direction, <HI>Is any one merry, let him &s;ing p&s;alms.</HI> It is al&s;o one means of in&s;truction, we mu&s;t <HI>teach and admoni&s;h one another, in p&s;alms, and hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs; &s;inging with grace in our hearts unto the Lord.</HI> Nothing &s;o much enlivens and promotes our devotion as this, the matter of which, is generally taken from the divine excellencies. Our <HI>tongue,</HI> the <HI>glory of our frame,</HI> is never &s;o much our glory, as when it is employed in prai&s;ing and adoring the great <HI>parent</HI> and <HI>fountain</HI> of all things.</P>
<P>P&s;almody has a powerful tendency to kindle and keep alive in the &s;oul the be&s;t affections. <Q>How exceedingly moved and affected have I been, &s;aid St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> at the hymns, and &s;ongs, and harmonious voices of the church!</Q> the&s;e voices <Q>pierced my ears, the truth entered my &s;oul, devout affections were rai&s;ed, and tears flowed.</Q> It bears indeed the neare&s;t re&s;emblance to the more refined and exalted employment of the heavenly inhabitants; who <HI>&s;ing the &s;ong of Mo&s;es the &s;ervant of God, and the &s;ong of the Lamb, &s;aying, great and marvelous are
<PB N="6" REF="009524_0004_0F768BB60F284B78">
thy works, Lord, God, Almighty; ju&s;t and true are thy ways, thou king of Saints!</HI></P>
<P>Their harmonious voices break out with cele&s;tial extacy, <HI>Hal|lelujah, &s;alvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God! They re&s;t not day, nor night, crying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.</HI></P>
<P>Happy for us, could we even bear &s;ome di&s;tant re&s;emblance to their &s;trains! but how far alas! do we fall below them! the prejudices of our education, the langour, and indi&s;po&s;ition of our &s;ouls, and the want of cele&s;tial fire; mi&s;lead or di&s;qualify us for the heavenly work: and that part of our religion that is the neare&s;t a-kin to heaven, &s;uffers mo&s;t, in this <HI>grovelling, unfriend|ly</HI> clime of life.</P>
<P>This was remarkably verified in the church of Corinth, in its infant, favourite &s;tate. The &s;pirit from on high was poured out upon them, in his immediate, extraordinary influences, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the &s;everal parts of divine wor&s;hip; to enable them the more expeditiou&s;ly and effectually to improve in the religion of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and &s;pread it abroad among the nations that then lay in the gloomy &s;hades of death. But the riche&s;t favours of heaven are not exempt from the abu&s;e of degenerate mankind: the Co|rinthians perverted the&s;e heavenly ble&s;&s;ings from their original de&s;ign; and made them the occa&s;ion of di&s;order and confu&s;ion among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Our context contains many excellent in&s;tructions to regulate the&s;e abu&s;es: and in the text we have St. Paul's re&s;olution rela|ting to that of P&s;almody; which he &s;et before the Corinthians as a &s;acred rule for them to walk by. And, as what was writ|ten aforetime, was written for our learning, on whom the ends of the world are come: it will, doutle&s;s be allowed a fit pattern for our imitation in the glorious work of &s;inging prai&s;es to <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>Lamb.</HI></P>
<P>My pre&s;ent de&s;ign is, to explain and determine the &s;en&s;e of the text; &s;hew how we may be&s;t comply with the duty recom|mended in it; an&s;wer the mo&s;t plau&s;ible objections; and im|prove the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to explain and determine the &s;en&s;e of the text. This &s;acred pa&s;&s;age has &s;uffered the fate of many others, to be put up|on the rack and tortured to &s;peak what it never intended. It has been argued from the words, <HI>I will &s;ing with the &s;pirit, and I will &s;ing with the under&s;tanding al&s;o;</HI>
<Q>That the apo&s;tle would
<PB N="7" REF="009524_0004_0F768BB60F284B78">
&s;ing nothing but divinely in&s;pired matter; that there were no &s;ongs of divine in&s;piration but the p&s;alms of <HI>David;</HI> therefore, the apo&s;tle would u&s;e none but them; nor tolerate any other to be &s;ung in the church of Corinth.</Q></P>
<P>This is certainly a very wild interpretation, and as foreign from the de&s;ign of St. Paul as any thing that can well be conceiv|ed; and it is hard to invent how the wilde&s;t fancy, or the mo&s;t de&s;perate dearth of rea&s;on, &s;hould force a man upon it: as it has not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of connexion either with the text, or with the &s;cope of St. <HI>Paul's</HI> rea&s;oning. It betrays ignorance of the &s;criptures, which abound with examples of &s;acred &s;ongs, both in the <HI>old</HI> and <HI>new te&s;tament,</HI> that are as divinely in&s;pired as tho&s;e of <HI>David;</HI> and many of them better &s;uited to the go&s;pel-church; as I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter: &s;o that it a&s;&s;erts what is really not true, <HI>viz.</HI> that there are no divinely in&s;pired &s;ongs but tho&s;e of <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame method of rea&s;oning from the text, would oblige us to u&s;e nothing but divinely in&s;pired matter in our <HI>prayers,</HI> as well as <HI>prai&s;es:</HI> or confine us in prayer, to the exact words of in&s;piration, and bind us up to forms that would not &s;uffer us to pour out our reque&s;ts to God in our own language, or &s;en&s;e of divine things, in the language of the new-te&s;tament; however agreeable to our own ca&s;e, or to the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture. The a|po&s;tle connects both together, and a&s;&s;erts the &s;ame of the one as of the other, and lays down the very &s;ame rule for our conduct in both. <HI>I will pray with the &s;pirit, and I will pray with the under&s;tanding al&s;o: I will &s;ing with the &s;pirit, and I will &s;ing with the under&s;tanding al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>That you may take up the &s;en&s;e of the apo&s;tle, in the words before us, you mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the &s;pirit of God impre&s;&s;ed upon the minds of the primitive chri&s;tians the knowledge of fo|reign languages unknown to them before; and enabled them to compo&s;e and &s;ing <HI>new &s;ongs of prai&s;e to the redeemer,</HI> agreeable to antient prophecies. I&s;aiah xlii. 9, 10. <HI>New things do I declare, before they &s;pring forth I tell you of them. Sing unto the Lord a new &s;ong, and his prai&s;e from the ends of the earth: ye that go down to the &s;ea, and all that is therein, the i&s;les and the inhabitants thereof:</HI> which may, with great propriety, be applied to Great-Britain, and her colonies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>They prayed, preached, prophe&s;ied, &s;poke and interpreted foreign tongues; compo&s;ed, and &s;ung &s;piritual &s;ongs; and in &s;hort, performed all the parts of divine wor&s;hip by the immedi|ate
<PB N="8" REF="009524_0005_0F768BB7C12A81F8">
in&s;piration of the holy &s;pirit. God was plea&s;ed to ble&s;s them in this extraordinary manner, to illu&s;trate his divine power; to put the &s;eal of a miracle to the &s;everal parts of chri&s;tian wor&s;hip; to convince the infidel world; and to confirm the church: as al|&s;o to &s;pread the glorious go&s;pel with greater expedition through the world, than it could otherwi&s;e be done.</P>
<P>Had the Corinthians &s;pread them&s;elves among the nations a|broad, and preached and explained the prophecies concerning Chri&s;t, to &s;hew their exact accompli&s;hment in him: had they a&s;&s;i&s;ted the devotion of the&s;e nations, by compo&s;ing evangelical &s;ongs to the <HI>Lord Je&s;us,</HI> upon his incarnation, life, death, re|&s;urrection, a&s;cention, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the apo&s;tle had wi&s;hed them &s;ucce&s;s, and the plea&s;ure of the Lord would have pro&s;pered in their hands. But they were full of them&s;elves, and eager to &s;hew their extra|ordinary powers, perverted their gifts, and came into their own church, and in&s;tead of edifying one another, in their own tongue, &s;poke in a language the hearers did not under&s;tand: neither would they wait for the permi&s;&s;ion or direction of him that pre|&s;ided in the a&s;&s;embly: but &s;everal began &s;peaking, or &s;inging in the &s;ame minute, and &s;ome began while others were &s;peaking. In this di&s;orderly manner they u&s;ed their gifts; one had a <HI>p&s;alm,</HI> or &s;ong, as it &s;ignifies in the Greek, to &s;ing; one had a <HI>doctrine</HI> to inculcate; had a <HI>tongue</HI> in which he preached or prayed; had a <HI>revelation</HI> of &s;ome my&s;tery; had an <HI>interpretation,</HI> which he probably began before <HI>he</HI> had done &s;peaking from whom he was to interpret: and thus five, or &s;ix, if not more, were &s;peaking at the &s;ame time; and the a&s;&s;embly was thrown into a kind of tu|multuous riot.</P>
<P>St. Paul expo&s;es their behaviour to ridicule, tells them, that to &s;peak in an unknown tongue in the church, was to &s;peak in the air, to make them&s;elves <HI>Barbarians</HI> to the people; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the learned Ovid &s;aid of him&s;elf, when bani&s;hed into Pontus, Bar|barus hic ego &s;um, quia non intelligor ulli. That in&s;tead of me|riting the reputation of learned, and wi&s;e, which they fondly de&s;ired, they behaved more like children, than men of under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I thank my God, &s;ays he, I &s;peak with tongues more than you all; yet in the church, I had rather &s;peak five words with my under&s;tanding; <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;o as to be under&s;tood, than ten thou&s;and words in an unknown tongue: for if I pray in an unknown tongue, my &s;pirit prayeth, but my under&s;tanding is unfruitful:
<PB N="9" REF="009524_0005_0F768BB7C12A81F8">
others have no benefit by my prayers, though they may edify my&s;elf: &s;o that the u&s;e you make of your gifts is only for o&s;ten|tation, and not for the edification of the church. <HI>I will pray with the &s;pirit, and I will pray with the under&s;tanding al&s;o: I will &s;ing with the &s;pirit, and I will &s;ing with the under&s;tanding al&s;o. i. e.</HI> I will make &s;uch u&s;e of the ordinary and extraordi|nary a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the holy &s;pirit, as &s;hall be mo&s;t beneficial to the church of Chri&s;t; and mo&s;t &s;uitable to the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, or to the glorious peculiarities of the religion of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> This is the plain &s;en&s;e of the text, and is &s;o natural and ea&s;y an interpre|tation that I know not of one approved commentator but agrees in it. See Pool's annotations. <HI>I will &s;ing with the &s;pirit,</HI> &amp;c. <Q>I will either u&s;e the extraordinary influences of the &s;pirit of God upon me, or with my own &s;pirit, with the utmo&s;t in|tention of my mind, and the greate&s;t devotion and fervour of affections. But I will &s;o pray that my&s;elf and others may un|der&s;tand what I &s;ay. The &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of &s;inging, to let us know, that all our religious actions in public a&s;&s;em|blies, ought to be &s;o performed, that others may be benefited by them, which they cannot be if they do not under&s;tand what we &s;ay, whether in preaching, praying, or &s;inging.</Q> So in the Syn-criticorum, he &s;ays, <Q>The <HI>&s;pirit</HI> here denotes the very mind or affections of him that prays or &s;ings.</Q> Dr. Doddridge, &s;ays, upon the words, <Q><HI>I will &s;ing the prai&s;es of God with the &s;pirit, but I will &s;ing with the under&s;tanding al&s;o;</HI> and take great care to mingle no fooli&s;h trifling action un|worthy the dignity of a rational creature with my prayers, or &s;ongs of prai&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall only &s;ubjoin a remark from mr. Henry's annotation on the words. <Q>The apo&s;tle, &s;ays he, does not forbid their pray|ing or &s;inging under a divine afflatus, or when they are in|&s;pired for this purpo&s;e, or had &s;uch a &s;piritual gift communi|cated to them: but he would have them perform both, &s;o as to be under&s;tood by others, and that others might join with them.</Q></P>
<P>Having explained the text, I &s;hall make the following re|marks,</P>
<P N="1">1. There is not the lea&s;t appearance in the text of a de&s;ign to confine the go&s;pel church to &s;ing the p&s;alms of <HI>David</HI> only&punc; What need of all this parade of words if this was what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">?

<PB N="10" REF="009524_0006_0F768BB858E34AC8">
a p&s;alm of David and &s;ing it in a chri&s;tian church to put an end to their di&s;order? This was no more than any common clerk could do. The apo&s;tle labours in his epi&s;tles to the &s;everal churches, with the warme&s;t zeal, to bring them off from the le|gal, carnal, jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, as he calls it; into the more glorious &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel: and can we think he would have them covered again with a jewi&s;h vail, which he had laboured &s;o much to take off? That he who had &s;o much love to Chri&s;t, that had &s;o much of his &s;pirit, that under all the ad|vantages of go&s;pel-light, would <HI>&s;ing the prai&s;es of God with the &s;pirit, and with the under&s;tanding al&s;o,</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly intend to involve the go&s;pel church again in <HI>jewi&s;h darkne&s;s;</HI> and compel them to &s;ing the dark &s;ayings of the <HI>Jews,</HI> which not one in an hundred could under&s;tand? It would be to compel them to break the command of God by <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf. P&s;alm xlvii. 7. <HI>Sing ye prai&s;es with under&s;tanding.</HI> It is directly contrary to what he labours &s;o much to illu&s;trate in the text and context, <HI>viz.</HI> that God &s;hould be wor&s;hiped with knowledge, and with the &s;pirit; who&s;e influences &s;hould be cheri&s;hed and improved for the good of others.</P>
<P>I will venture to affirm, there is not a church on earth, con|fined to &s;ing the p&s;alms of David all through, even in the <HI>Scotch</HI> ver&s;ion, as it is called, but mu&s;t break the command of God by David him&s;elf, and al&s;o this of St. Paul, that requires us to <HI>&s;ing with the &s;pirit, and with the under&s;tanding al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That we are authorized from the text to compo&s;e and &s;ing &s;piritual evangelical &s;ongs to the redeemer in chri&s;tian a&s;&s;emblies. The Corinthians were furni&s;hed with gifts and graces to compo&s;e and &s;ing &s;uch &s;ongs, &s;uitable to the &s;tate of the go&s;pel. God from on high in&s;pired them for the work, and approved it by the &s;anction of a miracle: which he never wrought but when there was real nece&s;&s;ity; much le&s;s would he &s;et his &s;eal to what was wrong. Infinite wi&s;dom &s;aw that &s;uch &s;ongs were nece&s;&s;ary for the go&s;pel church; and his grace a&s;&s;i&s;ted in compo&s;ing, and &s;inging them; and though they made a wrong u&s;e of this, and the other gifts of the &s;pirit, for which the <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> reproved them; yet the gift it&s;elf, and the right u&s;e of it, mu&s;t not be rejected: it cannot be done without &s;inning again&s;t the expre&s;s command.

<P>The dictates of rea&s;on, and the &s;en&s;e and experience of man|kind confirm this. The power of &s;inging was implanted in us chiefly for this purpo&s;e, that our warme&s;t affections &s;hould break out into natural and divine melody; and that the tongue of the wor&s;hiper might expre&s;s his own heart. One great end of &s;ing|ing is to pre&s;ent our own &s;en&s;e of divine things in &s;ongs addre&s;&s;ed to God, expre&s;&s;ing our own ca&s;e: though we may lawfully &s;ing the hi&s;tory of God's dealings with others: but in general, the matter of our <HI>P&s;almody</HI> &s;hould, as far as po&s;&s;ible, be adapted to the general &s;tate of the wor&s;hipers. The rea&s;on and experience of intelligent wor&s;hipers will tell you, Their devotion is never &s;o much rai&s;ed, as when they &s;peak in their own per&s;ons, and ex|pre&s;s their own &s;en&s;e of divine things. When the &s;ong &s;peaks our own de&s;ires, hopes, faith, love, and zeal; our &s;ouls take wing, and mount to God in holy melody. When it &s;peaks our repentance, fears, and &s;orrows, our vilene&s;s and ingratitude; we di&s;&s;olve into go&s;pel mourning. In prai&s;ing the <HI>mo&s;t high,</HI> we de&s;ign to &s;peak our own hearts, and our own words to him: our &s;ongs are chiefly expre&s;&s;ions of our own experience, or of his glories; we tell him the &s;en&s;e we have of his greatne&s;s and good|ne&s;s; and chiefly in in&s;tances that have &s;ome relation to us: we breathe out our &s;ouls to him, and make addre&s;&s;es to him of prai&s;e and acknowledgments. And therefore &s;uch parts of &s;cripture as cannot in their proper &s;en&s;e be applied to our congregations, or be made to &s;uit the&s;e ends of <HI>P&s;almody,</HI> &s;hould not be u&s;ed, at+lea&s;t, not chiefly, for the pattern or matter of <HI>go&s;pel P&s;almody.</HI> It cannot be done <HI>with under&s;tanding,</HI> agreeable to the genius of the go&s;pel, or to the frame of our own &s;pirit, when mo&s;t &s;uitably di&s;po&s;ed by the &s;pirit of God.</P>

<P>It has been often urged, <Q>that we &s;hould &s;ing nothing in di|vine wor&s;hip but divinely in&s;pired matter, and that we have no divinely in&s;pired materials for prai&s;e to God but the p&s;alms of David; therefore they only &s;hould be &s;ung.</Q> In an&s;wer to this plau&s;ible, groundle&s;s objection, I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. If it be intended in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, then nothing is to be &s;ung but the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> originals; and we mu&s;t &s;earch out the <HI>Hebrew</HI> mu&s;ic and language, and teach them to the churches before they can prai&s;e God.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P>It is agreed that our p&s;almody mu&s;t be put into ver&s;e, in or|der to &s;uit the go&s;pel church; the lines mu&s;t be confined to a certain number of &s;yllables; the &s;tanzas to a certain number of lines, to fit them for church mu&s;ic.

<PB N="16" REF="009524_0009_0F768BBA914C3900">
a much greater change, if turned into rhyme. One of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of this kind, &s;ays, <Q>that tho&s;e who have labour|ed with the utmo&s;t toil to keep clo&s;e to the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> have found it impo&s;&s;ible; and when they have attained it mo&s;t, have made but very poor mu&s;ic for a chri&s;tian church.</Q> He adds, with great rea&s;on, that the ver&s;ions mentioned above, cannot be called divinely in&s;pired matter. At be&s;t, they are but the &s;en&s;e of the original, as near as the authors could give it, which is far from a literal tran&s;lation: in <HI>dull, low</HI> ver&s;e, that have little as &s;uch, to recommend them to a <HI>per&s;on</HI> of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> unle&s;s it be that they are the mo&s;t unlike what they &s;hould be, or what they pretend to be. It is therefore at be&s;t, very far from the purpo&s;e, to imagine the above ver&s;ions are divinely in&s;pired matter; &s;ince there is no engli&s;h ver&s;ion in rhyme extent nor po&s;&s;ibly can be, that &s;trictly de&s;erves that denomi|nation.</P>
<P>Since there are other Compo&s;itions of chri&s;tian p&s;almody, as much the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture as any of the above; much more intelligible, fuller of go&s;pel light; and therefore more &s;uitable to the go&s;pel; and that in ea&s;y flowing, elegant ver&s;e, fit for the mo&s;t refined ta&s;te, and conde&s;cending to the meane&s;t capa|city; there can be no rea&s;on why we &s;hould deny our&s;elves the u&s;e of the&s;e evangelical &s;ongs.

<P>The truth is, when we preach or pray agreeable to &s;cripture, and our materials are taken from that &s;acred fountain, &s;uch preaching and praying are with ju&s;tice call'd the word of God, or of Chri&s;t: and pla&s;ms, and hymns, or &s;piritual &s;ongs, from the &s;ame &s;ource, are equally the word of God.

<P N="2">2. The <HI>examples we have in &s;cripture, in tran&s;lating the p&s;alms of David,</HI> the di&s;ciples and primitive chri&s;tians had many occa|&s;ions for prai&s;e; and yet I don't recollect more than two pieces of &s;ongs which they borrowed from the <HI>p&s;alms</HI> of <HI>David;</HI> and they &s;ung the&s;e with additions and improvements &s;uitable to the go&s;pel. The fir&s;t is in Luke xix. 37, 38. and taken from P&s;alm cxviii. 26. the words are, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</HI> The occa&s;ion of the &s;ong was, our Lord's triumphant entrance into <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> On this extraordinary oc|ca&s;ion, <HI>the whole multitude of the di&s;ciples</HI> began to rejoice and to prai&s;e God, with a loud voice, for all the mighty works which they had &s;een: and as the words of David were not &s;uffi|cient to expre&s;s the joyful &s;entiments of their hearts; they added tho&s;e enlargements and improvements that were &s;uitable to their own ca&s;e; and &s;ung, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed be the king,</HI> the <HI>king Je&s;us, that cometh in the name of the Lord:</HI> and after this paraphra&s;e, they enlarged the &s;ong, in the&s;e words, <HI>peace in heaven,</HI> and <HI>glory in the highe&s;t.</HI></P>

al&s;o:</HI> we are to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">porate the go&s;pel with them, give them an evangelical turn, and as far as po&s;&s;ible, give the &s;en&s;e of them in go&s;pel language and &s;entiments. This Doctor Watts has aimed at in his excellent imitation of the <HI>p&s;alms;</HI> and this has given it &s;o much credit in the world, among the be&s;t judges. It is an undoubted truth, which will &s;hine with greater lu&s;tre in the world, that the <HI>go&s;pel church</HI> is not confined to the <HI>p&s;alms of David</HI> in their &s;ongs of prai&s;e; and that the <HI>&s;en&s;e of &s;cripture,</HI> the <HI>old,</HI> but e&s;pecially, the <HI>new te&s;tament,</HI> wherever we find the mo&s;t agreeable matter for our &s;tate and circum|&s;tances, turned into ea&s;y ver&s;e, is the mo&s;t &s;uitable to the go&s;pel day.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P>The <HI>p&s;alms of David</HI> mu&s;t have an evangelical turn, in order to render them fit for the go&s;pel church; the extraordinary gifts of the &s;pirit be&s;towed on the primitive chri&s;tians, to ena|ble them to compo&s;e, and &s;ing, evangelical &s;ongs; the nature of the new te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation; our numerous occa&s;ions of prai&s;e under the go&s;pel; the great advantage believers have found by go&s;pel &s;ongs; and the &s;anction of human te&s;timony.</P>
<P N="1">1. From what has been already &s;aid it mu&s;t, I think, appear, that the <HI>p&s;alms</HI> of <HI>David</HI> &s;hould be &s;tripped of every thing pe|culiar to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and accommodated to the go&s;pel church. The language of <HI>judai&s;m,</HI> mu&s;t be changed into that of the go&s;pel; and the compo&s;ure and form of them mu&s;t be greatly altered. The &s;en&s;e may then be called the word of God, being founded upon it, agreeable to it, or borrowed from it; in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that our &s;ermons and prayers are the word of God. We may, we ought, to take the divine &s;en&s;e and materials from any part of &s;cripture that is mo&s;t &s;uitable to promote the great ends of p&s;almody; e&s;pecially as there are not any p&s;alms yet penned that an&s;wer all our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, which are &s;o very different from the <HI>jewi&s;h church.</HI> To confine the <HI>go&s;pel church</HI> to the p&s;alms of David &s;trictly, is certainly one of the greate&s;t ab&s;urdities that can be imagined; and &s;o injurious to it, that nothing &s;hort of the mo&s;t unaccountable prejudices, could influence men of rea&s;on and religion to &s;ubmit to it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="21" REF="009524_0011_0F768BBC112177B0">2. The extraordinary gifts of the &s;pirit be&s;towed on the pri|mitive chri&s;tians, to compo&s;e and &s;ing evangelical &s;ongs, from go&s;pel materials, put this beyond any rational ground of di&s;pute.</P>
<P>God never be&s;towed a precious gift in vain; he never wrought a miracle but when there was great and manife&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ity; and it was undoubtedly &s;o in this ca&s;e. It was nece&s;|&s;ary the <HI>new te&s;tament</HI> church &s;hould be furni&s;hed with new &s;ongs to celebrate the prai&s;es of <HI>God and the Lamb,</HI> for his <HI>new di&s;covered glories.</HI> The old te&s;tament had nothing clear and full enough to celebrate the wonders of go&s;pel grace. The new converts had not time to acquire and improve the divine art with expedition &s;uitable to the nece&s;&s;ity of the church; and the divine power interpo&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t them to compo&s;e and &s;ing di|vine &s;ongs to the <HI>Lord Je&s;us,</HI> for his grace that lay hid before; and God owned and confirmed this part of divine wor&s;hip, as well as others, with the &s;eal of a miracle.</P>
<P>Seeing the&s;e &s;ongs are <HI>the off &s;pring of God;</HI> have the &s;anction of a miracle to give them credit; and the bible contains a rich variety of excellent materials for &s;uch &s;acred <HI>anthems</HI> for the u&s;e of the church; it is plain they are the mo&s;t acceptable to God, as well as to his people who have been ble&s;t with the u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>On this head, that excellent man Doctor Doddridge, has a remark full to my purpo&s;e; his words are, <Q>It would be very ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that when there was &s;uch a gift, in the church, as we are &s;ure there was. 1 Cor. xiv. 15.16. Col. iii. 16. they &s;hould be confined to the words of <HI>David</HI> in all their devotions. It would certainly be as rea&s;onable for us in tho&s;e later ages, to explode all kinds of <HI>prayer</HI> in pub|lic, but liturgies collected from the <HI>words</HI> of &s;cripture, as all &s;acred &s;ongs in divine wor&s;hip but literal tran&s;lations from the <HI>book of p&s;alms;</HI> as numberle&s;s pa&s;&s;ages of the <HI>old</HI> and <HI>new te&s;tament,</HI> are equally capable of furni&s;hing us with &s;acred <HI>anthems.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;everal ends and de&s;igns of chri&s;tians in &s;inging the prai&s;es of God, throw farther light upon this &s;ubject. Neither the <HI>p&s;alms</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> nor any other &s;ongs in &s;cripture, already compo&s;ed, are &s;ufficient to expre&s;s all the language of a pious heart in &s;ongs of divine melody.

are the glorious di&s;coveries of the go&s;pel.

We experience a rich variety in the providence and grace of God, which merits our grateful a&s;criptions of prai&s;e: and as we &s;hould prai&s;e God for all his mercies in &s;ongs of poetry as well as in pro&s;e, our <HI>P&s;almody</HI> &s;hould be adapted to the&s;e occa&s;ions. It mu&s;t be owned, there is not a &s;et of <HI>p&s;alms</HI> in the bible to an&s;wer all the&s;e occa&s;ions of prai&s;e; though there are materials from which they may be taken. Can it be thought that God would have us confined to any &s;et form of his own compo&s;|ing, in <HI>this,</HI> more than in our preaching, or prayers? It is thought by many, a good rea&s;on, why we &s;hould reject the impo&s;ition of a prayer-book, that no number of compo&s;ed pray|ers
<PB N="26" REF="009524_0014_0F768BBF28F0E178">
can be found to expre&s;s every future want or difficulty of a chri&s;tian, or be exactly &s;uitable to every occa&s;ion in life. The rea&s;on is equally &s;trong in this ca&s;e; as there is no collection of divine &s;ongs in the <HI>bible,</HI> much le&s;s in <HI>David's p&s;alms,</HI> that can an&s;wer all our occa&s;ions of prai&s;e, we &s;hould therefore reject the impo&s;ition of that imperfect <HI>p&s;alm-book</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> fitted chiefly for <HI>Jews.</HI> It cannot rea&s;onably be thought that God ever in|tended the &s;ongs of <HI>David</HI> for a univer&s;al <HI>p&s;alm-book;</HI> as they could not extend to all the ca&s;es of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> in a &s;in|gle or &s;ocial capacity. Let any unprejudiced mind con&s;ider the 132 <HI>p&s;alm,</HI> for in&s;tance, in <HI>Rou&s;e's ver&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>Dr. Watts's imi|itation,</HI> &s;uited to the go&s;pel church, at the &s;ettlement of a mini|&s;ter; and let him judge which is be&s;t &s;uited to the temper of a chri&s;tian congregation on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; and he will, I doubt not, ea&s;ily &s;ee rea&s;on to give a great preference to the latter. In the one, the people may ea&s;ily expre&s;s the &s;entiments of their hearts, with under&s;tanding: which, I doubt, was hardly ever done in the other, by any congregation of chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The de&s;truction of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his ho&s;t, the victory of <HI>Barak</HI> and <HI>Si&s;era,</HI> the troubles and &s;ucce&s;&s;es of <HI>David,</HI> with all their particular circum&s;tances, are celebrated in the &s;ongs of <HI>Mo&s;es, Deborah</HI> and <HI>David.</HI> All the mournful &s;ongs that were compo&s;|ed before, were not fit to repre&s;ent the condition of the <HI>captive Jews,</HI> by the <HI>rivers</HI> of <HI>Babylon,</HI> till that admirable poem, the 137 P&s;alm, was compo&s;ed, to paint the language of their hearts in a <HI>divine &s;ong.</HI> There was not a <HI>p&s;alm</HI> in all the <HI>old te&s;tament</HI> pertinent enough to expre&s;s the new di&s;coveries of go&s;pel grace, in a holy &s;ong, that were made to <HI>Mary, Zacharias, Simeon,</HI> the <HI>Angels,</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> and <HI>primitive Chri&s;tians:</HI> therefore God put new &s;ongs into their mouths, to an&s;wer the &s;everal occa&s;ions which they had to prai&s;e him for his mercy. Their prayers, and &s;ermons, were new; &s;uitable to their new di&s;coveries; and &s;o were their &s;ongs of prai&s;e new. Had they not u&s;ed this liberty, they could not preach, or pray, or <HI>&s;ing with the &s;pirit, and with the under&s;tanding al&s;o:</HI> but their &s;pirits, and &s;ongs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> united in the &s;weet melody and joy.</P>
<P>To preach, and pray in generals, and wander remote from the ca&s;e of tho&s;e that hear us, is well known to be dull, unaffect|ing and unprofitable: it does not reach the heart, or con&s;cience; no; if we would do this, we mu&s;t come clo&s;e to their ca&s;es, and &s;o touch the heart. The &s;ame mu&s;t be done in P&s;almody, if we
<PB N="27" REF="009524_0014_0F768BBF28F0E178">
would have it the mo&s;t u&s;eful to mankind. And can it be ima|gined God would put a fre&s;h &s;ong into the mouths of his people under the <HI>old ta&s;tament</HI> &s;uitable to their particular ca&s;e; and in the beginning of the <HI>new te&s;tament</HI> to &s;uit theirs; and yet deny us the advantage of compo&s;ing and &s;inging new &s;ongs from go&s;|pel &s;ubjects, &s;uitable to our occa&s;ions of prai&s;e, in this more en|larged &s;tate of the go&s;pel? The &s;uppo&s;ition would &s;ink this di&s;|pen&s;ation of liberty, of the &s;pirit, of joy, and glory, below the <HI>bondage of judai&s;m.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The great advantages, of joy, comfort, and edification, which the people of God have found in the u&s;e of go&s;pel &s;ongs &s;uited to their ca&s;es, in various parts, and various ages of the chri&s;tian church, add con&s;iderable force to what has been &s;aid. They that have not ta&s;ted, will not perhaps, feel the force of this argument: but if you regard the te&s;timony of thou&s;ands, many of them eminent in the <HI>chri&s;tian church,</HI> the argument will ri&s;e and &s;trengthen apace. I &s;hall only add,</P>
<P N="8">8. The &s;anction of human te&s;timony. This I have in too great abundance for my narrow limits. I &s;hall only give a &s;pecimen from the early and later Days of the go&s;pel, from undi&s;putable authority. <HI>Pliny,</HI> about 71 years after the death of Chri&s;t, in|formed the emperor, <Q>That the Chri&s;tians met before day, it was a time of per&s;ecution, to &s;ing together a hymn to Chri&s;t as God.</Q> <HI>Tertullian,</HI> in the beginning of the third century, relates, <Q>That after the Chri&s;tians had eaten and drank the Lord's &s;upper by night,</Q> which they were forced to do, for fear of their enemies, <Q>every one was u&s;ed to &s;ing unto God publicly, either out of the holy &s;criptures, or according to their own genius and ability.</Q> <HI>Origen,</HI> in the middle of the third century, tell us of the chri&s;tian church, <Q>&s;inging hymns of prai&s;e to the father, in or by Chri&s;t, in good rhyme, tune, metre, and harmony.</Q> <HI>Dioni&s;ius</HI> &s;ays, <Q>I heartily love <HI>Ne|pos,</HI></Q> one of the fathers, <Q>for his faith, his &s;tudy of know|ledge, and the holy &s;criptures; as well as for various <HI>p&s;alms</HI> and <HI>hymns</HI> compo&s;ed by him, which are u&s;ed to this day.</Q> <HI>Spanheim</HI> relates of the fourth century, <Q>That be&s;ides <HI>hymns,</HI> and <HI>&s;ongs,</HI> and private <HI>p&s;alms,</HI> of which there was a great number in their &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies; the <HI>p&s;alm-book</HI> of David was brought into the we&s;tern church, in this age.</Q> The he|re&s;y of <HI>Artemon,</HI> who denied the divinity of Chri&s;t, was confu|ted, not only by the &s;criptures, and writings of the precedent
<PB N="28" REF="009524_0015_0F768BBFCED87DC8">
fathers, but al&s;o by the <HI>p&s;alms,</HI> and <HI>hymns</HI> of the brethren, which were formerly compo&s;ed by them, wherein they &s;ung prai&s;e to the <HI>word</HI> of God, declaring Chri&s;t to be God. Sometimes we find in the primitive fathers, that they made u&s;e of the <HI>p&s;alms</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> though very little, but chiefly, other &s;ongs compo&s;ed out of the &s;cripture, adapted to the peculiar &s;tate of the <HI>go&s;pel church.</HI></P>
<P>This is a brief view of the conduct of the earlie&s;t chri&s;tian church, in general; who it mu&s;t be allowed, ventured their lives, and their all, to follow the example of Chri&s;t, and his A|po&s;tles; and no doubt, in this, as well as in other branches of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Their <HI>P&s;almody</HI> was undoubtedly, mo&s;tly <HI>p&s;alms</HI> and <HI>hymns,</HI> which they compo&s;ed them&s;elves, from go&s;pel &s;ubjects, &s;uited to the &s;tate of the go&s;pel church. They continued in the u&s;e of them till <HI>Paulus Samo&s;atenus,</HI> a heretical bi&s;hop of <HI>Antioch</HI> ro&s;e up, and aboli&s;hed the&s;e <HI>p&s;alms,</HI> that were wont to be &s;ung to the ho|nor of the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and appointed women to &s;ing his own prai&s;e, on <HI>Ea&s;ter days</HI> in the church: for which he was ac|cu&s;ed and condemned by the council of <HI>Antioch.</HI> And it is worth notice, that this was an <HI>oecumenical council,</HI> the only one that was of that &s;ort for the fir&s;t 300 years after Chri&s;t, that I can find, con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters,</HI> and <HI>deputies,</HI> of as many churches as were plea&s;ed to come from all parts of the world.</P>
<P><HI>Go&s;pel &s;ongs</HI> were afterwards u&s;ed in the church in &s;ucceeding ages, and continued to our day. The churches of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;tland,</HI> without pretending to extraordinary gifts, make u&s;e of divine hymns compo&s;ed on go&s;pel &s;ubjects. The church of England approves of &s;uch; as appears by the &s;ongs they have added to the end of their old <HI>p&s;alms;</HI> and by the u&s;e which is made of <HI>Doctor Watts's P&s;almody,</HI> in &s;ome particular churches, at this day.</P>
<P>They are u&s;ed in mo&s;t, if not all the di&s;&s;enting churches in England; e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are the mo&s;t eminent for <HI>piety</HI> and <HI>learning;</HI> and in many of the churches in <HI>America.</HI> It mu&s;t give con&s;iderable force to this argument, that the general a&s;&s;em|bly of the church of Scotland, are warm advocates for evange|lical &s;ongs in chri&s;tian wor&s;hip; as their own words inform you. They &s;ay, <Q>It <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to the hymns.</NOTE> has been <HI>often</HI> and <HI>earne&s;tly</HI> de&s;ired, by pious and devout per&s;ons, to have our P&s;almody enlarged, by join|ing
<PB N="29" REF="009524_0015_0F768BBFCED87DC8">
with the <HI>p&s;alms of David,</HI> &s;ome other &s;piritual &s;ongs out of the <HI>new</HI> te&s;tament, as well as the <HI>old.</HI></Q> <Q>That the church of Scotland had this de&s;ign in view not long after the revolu|tion, and it has been at different times under their deliberati|on, as appears by &s;everal acts and recommendations of <HI>gene|ral a&s;&s;emblies.</HI></Q> At la&s;t, in the year 1742, a committee was appointed to prepare the&s;e &s;ongs. In 1744, more were added to the number, and the appointment renewed. In 1740, we have publi&s;hed, by order of the general a&s;&s;embly, a third eddi|tion of &s;acred, evangelical &s;ongs. They inform us, they <Q>chief|ly aimed at having the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture expre&s;&s;ed in ea&s;y ver&s;e; &s;uch as might be fitted to rai&s;e devotion, might be in|telligible to all, and might ri&s;e above contempt from per&s;ons of better ta&s;te.</Q> And, <Q>That the materials for this pious de&s;ign, are partly collected from the pious and ingenious <HI>Dr. Watts,</HI> and &s;ome other writers, and by &s;ome mini&s;ters of their own church.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Synod of New-York</HI> have al&s;o recommended the u&s;e of Doctor Watts's p&s;almody, in a ca&s;e debated before them, where the mini&s;ter and a great majority of the people earne&s;tly de|&s;ired them.</P>
<P>I am informed, that the <HI>Synod of Ul&s;ter in Ireland</HI> have al&s;o introduced them into their churches of late, by a &s;ynodical act.</P>
<P>If pious and devout per&s;ons have often and earne&s;tly de&s;ired &s;uch evangelical &s;ongs to be u&s;ed in the church; if the vener|able a&s;&s;embly in Scotland have given the &s;anction of their ap|probation, after many years deliberation, of go&s;pel p&s;almody in general, and <HI>of Doctor Watts's</HI> in particular; if the chri&s;tian church have u&s;ed &s;uch in early and later ages; and they have obtained &s;uch general approbation: I hope we &s;hall not be <HI>flared</HI> at, as acting without precedent; nor charged with <HI>in|novations,</HI> by any that regard the credit of their own reading or under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I now proceed to an&s;wer objections,</P>
<P N="3">III. 1&s;t. It is objected, that the directions and examples of &s;cripture confine us to &s;ing <HI>the in&s;pired &s;ongs of David.</HI> Deut. xxxi. 16. and ix. 21. P&s;al. lxxxi. 1.&mdash;4. 1 Chron. xvi. 17. 2 Chron. xxix. 27&mdash;30. 1 Sam. xxiii. 1, 2. An&s;.</P>
<P N="1">1. A little attention to the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages will convince you they refer to the ceremonious wor&s;hip of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that dwelt in <HI>Canaan,</HI> that paid their wor&s;hip at the new-moon, and other <HI>jewi&s;h fe&s;tivals,</HI> with timbrels, and trumpets, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="30" REF="009524_0016_0F768BC0C4EFD310">2. They no more oblige us to &s;ing the &s;ongs of David than that in Ho&s;. xiv. 2. confines us to pray in in&s;pired forms. Both commands run in the &s;ame manner; and as we are not bound in the one, &s;o we are not in the other.</P>
<P N="3">3. They do not prohibit the Jews them&s;elves the u&s;e of pri|vate compo&s;ures in their &s;ynagogues, and why &s;hould not chri&s;|tians &s;ing evangelical compo&s;ures to &s;uit their ca&s;e; e&s;pecially, as mo&s;t of the <HI>p&s;alms</HI> of <HI>David</HI> are fitted for <HI>Jews,</HI> and not for Chri&s;tians?</P>
<P N="2">2d <HI>Objection.</HI> No man can pretend to make or &s;ing better &s;ongs than the &s;pirit of God has left us in the bible; and to neglect the&s;e, and &s;ing human compo&s;ures, expo&s;es to the cur&s;e. Mal. i. 13, 14. An&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. We cannot pretend to make better prayers or &s;ermons, than tho&s;e of <HI>Mo&s;es, Solomon,</HI> the <HI>Prophets, Chri&s;t,</HI> and his <HI>Apo&s;tles&punc;</HI> and why &s;hould we not be confined to the&s;e forms of <HI>praying,</HI> and <HI>preaching,</HI> as well as <HI>&s;inging?</HI> If we may compo&s;e prayers, and &s;ermons, &s;uitable to our own ca&s;e, without falling under the <HI>cur&s;e;</HI> doubtle&s;s we may compo&s;e and &s;ing <HI>p&s;alms</HI> and <HI>hymns</HI> in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tho' we can't pretend to make better prayers, and &s;ermons, than <HI>Ezra, Daniel,</HI> or <HI>our Lord,</HI> for that day, and the occa&s;ions for which they were prepared: yet as God accommodates his gifts and revelations to &s;pecial &s;ea&s;ons and occa&s;ions of the church; a divine &s;ong, &s;ermon, or prayer, compo&s;ed agreea|ble to the word of God, that expre&s;&s;es our own wants, duties, and mercies, is certainly much fitter for us, than tho&s;e that do not reach our ca&s;e; and cannot &s;o well a&s;&s;i&s;t our graces, nor rai&s;e our devotion.</P>
<P N="3">3. I grant that nothing can be more proper than in&s;pired lan|guage, in our prayers, &s;ermons, and &s;ongs of prai&s;e: and God has often te&s;tified his approbation of it, in the hearts of his peo|ple; but it has been when the&s;e phra&s;es have been clear, and pertinent to our own ca&s;e, and &s;en&s;e of divine things. We are not therefore to dre&s;s up our prayers, &s;ermons, or prai&s;es, in the &s;tile of <HI>judai&s;m,</HI> when we would expre&s;s go&s;pel doctrines, This would be to darken coun&s;el by words without knowledge; to amu&s;e and confound the ignorant wor&s;hipers.</P>
<P>We may as well read a &s;ermon of <HI>Mo&s;es, I&s;aiah,</HI> or the royal preacher <HI>Solomon,</HI> to our congregations, in&s;tead of preaching the go&s;pel, as &s;ing many of the <HI>p&s;alms</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> that are peculiar to
<PB N="31" REF="009524_0016_0F768BC0C4EFD310">
<HI>David</HI> the <HI>king,</HI> the <HI>&s;hepherd,</HI> the <HI>fugitive,</HI> the <HI>jewi&s;h mu&s;ician.</HI> In brief, the &s;ermons, prayers, or &s;ongs, recorded in &s;cripture, are not given us for forms, to which we mu&s;t be invariably con|fined; but as patterns, by which we are taught to adju&s;t the &s;e|veral parts of wor&s;hip to our ca&s;e. And as &s;ermons, and pray|ers &s;o adju&s;ted, are properly called the word of God, &s;o are &s;uch &s;ongs of prai&s;e; and therefore proper materials for <HI>chri&s;tian P&s;almody.</HI></P>
<P>And we have as much rea&s;on to expect the divine ble&s;&s;ing up|on <HI>&s;uch &s;ongs,</HI> as in tran&s;lating the &s;criptures into our tongue; writing tracts of divinity, or reading them when written; or in turning the <HI>p&s;alms</HI> of <HI>David</HI> into any kind of <HI>rhyme,</HI> and &s;inging them afterwards.</P>
<P>Search and examine the &s;criptures, and you will find, that whenever any &s;pecial di&s;play of divine grace or providence gave occa&s;ion, the &s;aints made u&s;e of a <HI>new &s;ong,</HI> &s;uitable to the occa&s;i|on. And if it be &s;aid, "They were better fitted, by extraor|dinary gifts, for &s;uch compo&s;ures than we are;" I an&s;wer, We have greatly the advantage of them, in having the cannon of &s;a|cred &s;cripture compleat, and many excellent helps and improve|ments, which they had not; and equal rea&s;on to depend upon the divine ble&s;&s;ing and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="3">3d <HI>Objection.</HI> To u&s;e any <HI>P&s;almody</HI> but what God has given us for this purpo&s;e by immediate in&s;piration, is will-wor&s;hip, and the inventions of men. An&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. To alter the p&s;alms of David, and confine them to an ex|act number of &s;yllables or rhymes, to &s;ing in our churches, may equally be called will-wor&s;hip, and human inventions: and yet this mu&s;t be done, or the churches cannot obey the divine com|mand, to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">g his prai&s;es. We have no more divine warrant to &s;ing the expre&s;s words of the <HI>old ver&s;ion,</HI> or <HI>Sternhold and Hop|kins,</HI> than we have to &s;ing any other divine &s;ongs compo&s;ed a|greeable to the go&s;pel. The truth is, this is one among the ma|ny things which God has left to the wi&s;dom and di&s;retion of the churches, to u&s;e tho&s;e p&s;alms that are mo&s;t agreeable to their cir|cum&s;tances, and mo&s;t for their edification.</P>
<P N="4">4th <HI>Objection.</HI> How can the compo&s;ers of go&s;pel p&s;almody, omit, alter, or tran&s;po&s;e, the in&s;pired &s;ongs, from the order in which the holy &s;pirit has placed them, without falling under the cur&s;e denoun&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e that add too, or take from the word of God. Rev. xxii. 18.19.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="32" REF="009524_0017_0F768BC154DFDB58">1. By the very &s;ame authority that go&s;pel mini&s;ters, or pri|vate chri&s;tians, alter and tran&s;po&s;e, or omit any parts of in&s;pired writings; to render them more pertinent materials for &s;ermons, or prayers, for them&s;elves or others.</P>
<P N="2">2. Many pious and judicious per&s;ons that have been confi|ned to &s;ing the ver&s;ions of <HI>Rou&s;e</HI> or <HI>Sternhold and Hopkins,</HI> have found from experience, that when their &s;ouls have been quick|en'd and enlarged in &s;inging one &s;tanza &s;uitable to their ca&s;e; the very next ver&s;e has given a &s;udden check to the &s;weetne&s;s and harmony of their devotion, by &s;omething peculiar to the <HI>Jew,</HI> the <HI>King,</HI> the <HI>Fugitive;</HI> or dark, and unintelligible at this day, or remote from their own ca&s;e. They could go no farther with the &s;ong, <HI>with under&s;tanding;</HI> nor cheri&s;h the &s;weet influence of the &s;pirit upon their hearts. And they mu&s;t &s;eek out &s;ome other p&s;almody, or, have David in a different form, or di&s;obey the apo&s;tolic injunction in my text. <HI>Dr. Watts's excellent imi|tation</HI> has relieved the chri&s;tian wor&s;hiper from this di&s;tre&s;s; in the judicious tran&s;po&s;ition of <HI>David's</HI> p&s;alms in &s;uch a manner, that we have 5, 6, or 8 &s;tanzas together, that may be applied to our own ca&s;e or &s;ubject. And this is certainly one of his great excellencies, wherein he has done more &s;ervice to the church than any poetical tran&s;lators that have gone before him.</P>
<P N="3">3. The be&s;t &s;ermons, and prayers, are collected from various parts of the &s;cripture &s;uitable to the de&s;ign, and circum&s;tances of tho&s;e for whom they are prepared, tho' far from the natural order in which they &s;tand in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> originals, yet we never &s;u&s;pect the authors of falling under the cur&s;e, mentioned a|bove: no: It is counted an excellence in a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, to col|lect the mo&s;t pertinent materials for &s;ermons or prayers; however far from the natural order in which the holy &s;pirit has placed them in the bible. The good <HI>Dr. Watts</HI> him&s;elf has favoured the world with <HI>&s;ermons</HI> and <HI>prayers,</HI> that are, by &s;ome per&s;ons, thought good and excellent, though not <HI>verbatim</HI> in the original order: and be|cau&s;e he has indulged his poetical talents, as he has his capacity to preach and pray, for the benefit of the church, mu&s;t he be bltoted out of the book of life, and fall under the heavie&s;t cur&s;e?</P>
<P N="5">5th <HI>Objection.</HI> We &s;hould u&s;e no p&s;almody but what is autho|rized by the a&s;&s;embly of the kirk of Scotland, or by the &s;ynod. <HI>An&s;wer,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It would &s;eem agreeable to &s;ee all the churches unite in the u&s;e of the be&s;t compo&s;ed p&s;almody, fit for the go&s;pel day. But it &s;hould be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="33" REF="009524_0017_0F768BC154DFDB58">2. That God has only enjoined the duty of prai&s;e, without giving us an exact form, to which we &s;hould be invariably confined. And &s;ince the education, the prejudices, the circum&s;tances, the very make and di&s;po&s;itions of men, are &s;o va&s;tly different one from another; the &s;entiments of mankind are very different on this head; and God may be wor&s;hiped &s;in|cerely in different modes, though not with equal advantage to the wor&s;hiper: it is evident, God has conde&s;cended to the dif|ferent conditions of mankind; that variety, in this particular, is nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;uit the variety there is among pious wor&s;hipers. And that this is left by infinite wi&s;dom, to the conduct of hu|man wi&s;dom and prudence, under the general directions of &s;cripture. And &s;hould a <HI>general a&s;&s;embly,</HI> or <HI>&s;ynod</HI> interpo&s;e and order, that &s;uch or &s;uch a ver&s;ion, or collection of <HI>p&s;alms</HI> or <HI>hymns,</HI> &s;hould be &s;ung in all the churches, and no other, it would be an arbitrary incroachment upon the rights of chri&s;tians; who are certainly at liberty to preach, pray, or prai&s;e the Lord, as they &s;hall judge mo&s;t for edification, or agreeable to the direction in my text. I have no more notion of eccle&s;ia&s;tical, than civil tyran|ny. There is no &s;ynod, a&s;&s;embly, or council on earth, that hath, or ought to have, power to impo&s;e any one ver&s;ion of p&s;alms on the chri&s;tian churches.</P>
<P>If the objector means, that our p&s;almody &s;hould have the approbation, or the recommendation of the <HI>a&s;&s;embly,</HI> or <HI>&s;ynod;</HI> I have &s;hewn that this has been done, by both; in a manner &s;ufficient to an&s;wer our purpo&s;e, and engage our thankfulne&s;s to God, that we have the countenance of &s;o good example, and authority to &s;upport us.</P>
<P>There have been in every age, men of high-flying, arbritary principles, who&s;e unlimitted notions of church power would prompt them to impo&s;e the decrees of councils, and &s;ynods, &amp;c. upon the church, and cut off the right of private judgment, with|out liberty to call in que&s;tion their authority, and the laity mu&s;t be doomed to the lowe&s;t &s;lavery. The&s;e men generally &s;et up their own opinion as the te&s;t of orthodoxy, and judge the prac|tice of others to be a <HI>crime,</HI> or <HI>duty,</HI> which they judge to be &s;o in them&s;elves, without the lea&s;t allowance for their different circum&s;tances or &s;entiments. From this principle the <HI>antichri&s;|tian</HI> &s;pirit of impo&s;ition and per&s;ecution had its original. And when this <HI>horrid mon&s;ter</HI> &s;talks abroad in the world, dre&s;&s;ed up in the garb of <HI>zeal</HI> for the mild and gentle religion of Je&s;us; it
<PB N="34" REF="009524_0018_0F768BC21072D4A8">
is more to be abhorred than the tyrant, that had a bed of his own &s;ize, and was &s;aid to &s;tretch men of low &s;tature upon a rack, to the full length of it; and cut off the legs of all he found too long for it. What injuries has the church of Chri&s;t &s;u&s;tained from this principle in former ages! thanks be to God, it is more out of countenance now, by numbers whom God in his infinite mercy has rai&s;ed up, who are of candid and chri&s;tian &s;entiments, and would not &s;tretch eccle&s;ia&s;tical power beyond the limits that are &s;et by the great head of the church. And I have the plea&s;ure to hope, that we &s;hall &s;hew to the world, we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame chri&s;tian &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Judicatures have a right to judge of the &s;oundne&s;s or un&s;ound|ne&s;s of our p&s;almody, as well as of our &s;ermons, or prayers&punc; and to countenance or di&s;countenance accordingly: but they have no power to impo&s;e a ver&s;ion of <HI>David's p&s;alms</HI> by <HI>Mr. Rou&s;e,</HI> upon churches that think they can prai&s;e God more to edification and improvement in <HI>Doctor Watts's</HI> imitation, or any other ortho|dox collection of p&s;alms; than they have to impo&s;e &s;et forms of &s;ermons, or prayers, from which we mu&s;t never deviate.</P>
<P>There are many eminent chri&s;tians who cannot u&s;e the free|dom to &s;ing any other than the <HI>Scotch</HI> ver&s;ion; it has been &s;o long bound up in our bibles that &s;ome are of opinion, it is as divinely in&s;pired as if it had been made by David him&s;elf. Others cannot &s;ing this ver&s;ion with &s;atisfaction, while they have others more agreeable and improving: &s;ome can &s;ing both as occa&s;ion requires; and to impo&s;e in either ca&s;e would be a tyrannical incroachment upon the rights of chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer therefore to the petition laid before us, reque&s;ting our judgments, whether Doctor Watts's p&s;almody may be &s;ung to chri&s;tian improvement and edification, we may, I think, ea&s;ily determine, without any injury to churches or individuals. You may ea&s;ily gather from what has been &s;aid, the judgment of the general a&s;&s;embly, and others; and I believe &s;hould we judge otherwi&s;e, it would contribute nothing to the credit of our under&s;tandings, in a world where their evangelical beauties and excellencies have been &s;o generally admired.</P>
<P>We are not to form an ab&s;olute determination that one ver|&s;ion &s;hall be u&s;ed in the churches, and the other rejected&punc; we may as well arrogate the power of impo&s;ing <HI>liturgies,</HI> or <HI>&s;et forms</HI> of <HI>prayers</HI> and <HI>&s;ermons.</HI> But &s;ince we cannot bear impo|&s;ition in the one, let us equally abhor it in the other; yea in every ca&s;e where there are manife&s;t rea&s;on for &s;o doing.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="35" REF="009524_0018_0F768BC21072D4A8">7th. <HI>Objection.</HI> If we admit Watts's p&s;almody into the church, it will open a door for error and here&s;y; as others may be emboldened by &s;uch a liberty, to introduce erroneous p&s;alms, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>An&s;wer.</HI> By the very &s;ame argument, as I have often hinted, you &s;hould forbid all preaching and praying, but <HI>pre|&s;cribed,</HI> and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed forms;</HI> there is as great, yea greater dan|ger in the one ca&s;e than in the other; as the number that preach and pray is greater, than of tho&s;e who attempt to com|po&s;e divine &s;ongs; and here&s;y in preaching and praying is as injurious to the church, as in &s;inging. Since it is judged mo&s;t for edification that we u&s;e our own judgments, our own &s;en&s;e of divine things, in our own language, though we are liable to err, in prayer and preaching; it is equally edifying and ne|ce&s;&s;ary in our &s;ongs of prai&s;e; and equally &s;afe from here&s;y; and more &s;o in this ca&s;e, as the Doctor's and other go&s;pel &s;ongs are known and approven by the <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and learned; which &s;er|mons and prayers cannot be till they have &s;pread their contagion.</P>
<P N="2">2. If at any time here&s;y &s;hould be introduced into the church by &s;piritual &s;ongs; it will then be fit that the church interpo&s;e and &s;uppre&s;s it: they may at any time exert the thun|der of their power again&s;t proper objects of it. But there is a thou&s;and times more danger of here&s;y from preaching and pray|ing, than from &s;inging prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="8">8th <HI>Objection.</HI> Doctor Watts has left out &s;ome of the p&s;alms of David, therefore he has thrown away part of the &s;criptures.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. The Doctor him&s;elf informs us, he e&s;teems the p&s;alms an excellent part of holy writ: but that &s;ome particu|lar p&s;alms, or part of p&s;alms, are not the fitte&s;t materials for go&s;pel &s;ongs; and does he hence reject them from the &s;acred canon?</P>
<P>The &s;criptures are a rich trea&s;ure of materials for various oc|ca&s;ions; and can a man be charged with rejecting &s;cripture be|cau&s;e he does not apply particular parts of it to purpo&s;es for which it was never intended? Does a mini&s;ter reject all the parts of &s;cripture which he does not think &s;uitable to his de|&s;ign, or various occa&s;ions: Would it be fair rea&s;oning to &s;ay, I reject all the &s;criptures, I do not judge pertinent to my de&s;ign in this &s;ermon?</P>

<P N="1">1. If you would &s;ing the p&s;alms of David in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, you mu&s;t &s;ing <HI>Hebrew,</HI> or at lea&s;t, a literal tran&s;lation of them into Engli&s;h. But if you mean the <HI>Scotch ver&s;ion,</HI> done by Rou&s;e, the objection &s;erves to di&s;cover weakne&s;s, or a bad cau&s;e, the competition is not between <HI>Watts</HI> and <HI>David;</HI> but between <HI>Watts</HI> and <HI>Rou&s;e.</HI> Since <HI>Rou&s;e's</HI> is far from an exact tran&s;lation; has many ideas added to the original, or taken from it: has given us the &s;ublime&s;t poetry in <HI>low</HI> and <HI>dull</HI> ver&s;e, that in &s;ome places can hardly be called good &s;en&s;e. Be&s;ides when you &s;ing it, you join ideas that were not &s;o much as known to <HI>David</HI> or the <HI>Jews:</HI> therefore it is far from be|ing the p&s;alms of David. If you &s;ing Dr. <HI>Watts's imitation,</HI> you have more honor done to the royal p&s;almi&s;t, as he is made more intelligible; and &s;peaks the language, and gives the ideas which he longed to u&s;e, and only touched at darkly, which he would have &s;poke fully had he lived in our day; and his ad|mirable compo&s;ures give light and joy to the &s;aints that live two thou&s;and years after him. To &s;ing David's p&s;alms &s;trictly, you mu&s;t have the &s;ame ideas and meaning which he had: you mu&s;t go into the temple at Jeru&s;alem, and prai&s;e the Lord with a <HI>harp,</HI> and <HI>trumpet;</HI> and &s;ometimes hang your u&s;ele&s;s harps upon the willows by the rivers of Babylon. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But you reject this and &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. You only intend to &s;ing <HI>Rou&s;e's ver&s;ion,</HI> and that not li|terally; you will give it a &s;piritual meaning; or, you will wor&s;hip God according to his appointment <HI>now,</HI> as David did according to his appointment <HI>then.</HI> This I take to be your true &s;en&s;e, then you are involved in the&s;e difficulties; to con|fine your&s;elves to the u&s;e of words that cannot be addre&s;&s;ed to God in their proper &s;en&s;e; to &s;ing one thing and mean ano|ther; to make your hearts and your lips go contrary one to the other; to make every private chri&s;tian &s;peak to God in the language of a <HI>jewi&s;h king, captain, jewi&s;h mu&s;ician,</HI> &amp;c. to la|bour
<PB N="37" REF="009524_0019_0F768BC2D4FD4698">
to turn the &s;ong to his own ca&s;e every time he joins in it, and give it a &s;en&s;e quite different from its original de&s;ign; and in a word, to labour in the mo&s;t di&s;advantagious manner to do what I am pleading for; <HI>i. e.</HI> to give an evangelical turn to the p&s;alms, in order to <HI>&s;ing with the &s;pirit,</HI> and <HI>with the under&s;tand|ing al&s;o.</HI> You throw this burthen upon the multitude every time they &s;ing; you leave the divine oracles to be tortured by every ignorant and illiterate per&s;on. The wi&s;e may probably be able in this manner to give a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e to <HI>David</HI> with|out di&s;honor to the p&s;almi&s;t: but the multitude cannot. We all agree <HI>David's</HI> p&s;alms are not to be &s;ung in a literal &s;en&s;e; we agree, they mu&s;t have a &s;piritual meaning. Now I appeal to common &s;en&s;e,</P>
<P N="3">3. Whether it be not infinitely be&s;t to have this evangelical turn given to the p&s;alms by &s;ome able skilful hand? Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> has given them that turn we all agree they &s;hould have; his &s;uperior genius, learning, piety, and poetical talents rendered him fit for the work. He looked upon it as of the greate&s;t im|portance to the church; called in all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of commen|tators, &s;tudy, and prayers, for the divine ble&s;&s;ing; he calls it the greate&s;t labour of his life; and the be&s;t judges highly e&s;teem and admire it, as an excellent &s;ervice done to the church: we have an evangelical turn given to David, in go&s;pel lan|guge, plain, ea&s;y, &s;mooth, and elegant; level to the lowe&s;t capacity; and above the contempt of a politer ta&s;te. If you plead that every mini&s;ter may explain the p&s;alm before &s;ing|ing, to enable the people to &s;ing with under&s;tanding; it is not one in a hundred that is &s;o well qualified to do it as the Doctor was; and the learned them&s;elves cannot pretend to do it &s;o well in the very time of &s;inging: but to leave this to be done by crouds of illiterates; to &s;ubmit an extempory <HI>imitation</HI> of <HI>David's p&s;alms</HI> to be made by every vulgar hearer, every time he &s;ings; which he could not do to any purpo&s;e in an age; is as unrea&s;onable as any thing can be imagined; to leave the&s;e to explain and accommodate the ob&s;curities of a <HI>jewi&s;h p&s;alter</HI> to the go&s;pel day; who are &s;o ignorant, that they are in dan|ger of wre&s;ting the mo&s;t plain dictates of the go&s;pel to their own de&s;truction; and to maintain that they are well qualified for it, and had better do it them&s;elves than &s;ing in the language of the excellent Doctor's imitation; is one of the greate&s;t ab|&s;urdities that can be maintained; and carries its own refutation

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="4">IV. Thus according to appointment, my Rev. Fathers and Brethren, I give my thoughts on this &s;ubject; I have endeavour|ed to do it in that manner which would do the greate&s;t ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject; be lea&s;t liable to exception; and give the lea&s;t of|fence to any that might differ from me in &s;entiments upon this head: with this view I have oppo&s;ed &s;entiments rather than per|&s;ons. I am &s;en&s;ible that men of eminent learning and piety think very differently one from another on this as well as other points. I abhor the notion of condemning tho&s;e that differ from me, as I do of tho&s;e that condemn me, becau&s;e I differ for them. Per&s;ons of great merit may vary in their opinions of this as well as other things; their &s;entiments may be as much di|ver&s;ified as their faces. But &s;ince I am at liberty, and e&s;peci|ally, as I am required, I give my &s;entiments, and the rea&s;ons of my conduct. Though I had rather &s;it at your feet and learn from you on this occa&s;ion, yet I am not a&s;hamed to declare to you and to the world, that I believe we &s;hould &s;ing the prai&s;es of God and the Lamb, that wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his own blood; and that in the &s;entiments and language of the go&s;pel;

or that our <HI>p&s;alm-book</HI> &s;hould contain all the advantages of the go&s;pel, as well as our &s;ermons, prayers, or any other chri&s;tian duties; <HI>if we would &s;ing with the &s;pirit, and with the under|&s;tanding al&s;o.</HI> That to confine the church to the <HI>Scotch ver&s;ion,</HI> i. e. to the &s;tile and &s;entiments of <HI>Jews,</HI> or in other words, to a <HI>jewi&s;h p&s;alm-book,</HI> for <HI>go&s;pel wor&s;hip;</HI> to be &s;ung in their literal &s;en&s;e, or left to be tortured and mangled by every illeterate in the promi&s;cuous croud, to give them a &s;piritual meaning, or go&s;pel turn to his own ca&s;e, according to his knowledge or rather igno|rance; i. e. to make vulgar imitations of David's p&s;alms, extem|pore, every time he &s;ings; is far, very far from being the be&s;t way to &s;ing with the under&s;tanding: that no go&s;pel church on earth that is confined to it all through, ever has, or po&s;&s;ibly can <HI>&s;ing with the &s;pirit and under&s;tanding,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of the text; and therefore that it is a very great injury, to confine the church to &s;uch a form. I think no one will plead the p&s;alms &s;hould be &s;ung &s;trictly in their literal meaning; with all the ideas of Da|vid, and in the manner that he wor&s;hiped God in jewi&s;h &s;yna|gogues; for then we mu&s;t go into their land, their &s;ynagogues, and u&s;e all their pompous concert of jewi&s;h mu&s;ic, &amp;c. and if not, they mu&s;t put a go&s;pel meaning or turn to them as they &s;ing: this is the very thing I plead for; herein we all agree; only, I would have this done to our hand by a &s;kilful per&s;on, well furni&s;hed for the undertaking; and not left to the manage|ment of the vulgar croud. Such a practice, I will maintain, is manife&s;tly contrary to the &s;criptures, and the plaine&s;t dictates of rea&s;on, without a divine warrant. If there be any notwith&s;tand|ing that will &s;ing the <HI>Scotch</HI> ver&s;ion, and nothing el&s;e; let them enjoy their liberty, and never be mole&s;ted but by rational and chri&s;tian arguments. I am not a bigot to any one ver&s;ion: I u&s;e that of Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> becau&s;e I think it the be&s;t now extant that I know of: but do not take his <HI>p&s;alms</HI> and <HI>hymns</HI> to be a com|pleat &s;et of P&s;almody for all the occa&s;ions of Chri&s;tians, even in our colonies. But I am fully per&s;uaded the churches in the&s;e parts have received very great advantage from his excellent compo&s;itions; e&s;pecially his &s;acramental hymns. And I take this opportunity to acknowledge my&s;elf indebted to him for ma|ny of the &s;entiments I have laid before you on this occa&s;ion. And cannot but hope they will have con&s;iderable weight with e|very candid &s;earcher after truth. Yet I could wi&s;h to &s;ee a more compleat &s;y&s;tem collected from approven authors, to &s;uit all &s;ub|jects and ca&s;es: and this might be done to much greater perfecti|on&punc;

than ever yet has been; I could wi&s;h al&s;o to &s;ee it recom|mended to the church; as tho&s;e others have been which we now u&s;e. The &s;ubject is copious, and have been confined only to touch on the &s;everal topics of argument to &s;upport the doctrine; each of which well handled would make a &s;ermon. In &s;hort, if my time, e&s;pecially my talents, were equal to my &s;ubject, I &s;hould pour out a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s torrent of argument, from &s;cripture, and rea&s;on, of human and divine, of antient and modern, autho|rity, that would make the &s;ubject glare with meridian lu&s;tre; and cau&s;e the inveterate ob&s;tinacy of prejudice it&s;elf, to confe&s;s that <HI>go&s;pel P&s;almody</HI> is undoubtedly the propere&s;t for <HI>go&s;pel wor&s;hipers;</HI> and that &s;uch, and &s;uch only &s;hould be u&s;ed in the chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded, that if the more pious, and judicious &s;ort of Chri&s;tians, that have confined them&s;elves to &s;ing <HI>Rou&s;e's ver&s;ion,</HI> and have thought they &s;hould &s;ing nothing el&s;e; would throw a&s;ide their prejudices, and lay them&s;elves open to conviction; and read, compare, and examine, by rea&s;on and &s;cripture, the different &s;pirit that breathes in the&s;e evangelical &s;ongs, from tho&s;e which they have u&s;ed: they would &s;oon find them abun|dantly more &s;uitable to the go&s;pel, and to a chri&s;tian frame of &s;pirit. And I can't but urge you to do this &s;ervice to your&s;elves, as your own &s;piritual advantage is at &s;take: and doubt not but that you will find your very great advantage in &s;o doing. You will find them peculiarly &s;uitable to go&s;pel &s;ermons, &s;acraments, and prayers; having a happy tendency to render them more &s;ervice|able to all that heartily de&s;ire to imbibe more and more of the heaven-born religion of <HI>Je&s;us:</HI> and to pa&s;s on from &s;ongs of prai&s;e here, to <HI>him that loved us, and wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his own blood,</HI> to join in the higher a&s;criptions of prai&s;e, with the heavenly Ho&s;ts, &s;aying, <HI>Hallelujah, &s;alvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God! and to the Lamb that was &s;lain, and that redeemed us to God by his blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.

God grant, it may be our eternal employment, mingled with the ble&s;&s;ed millions on high, to a&s;cribe to him, glory, and dominion, for ever and ever. Amen.</P>
