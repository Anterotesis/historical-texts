<P>IT has been a &s;ubject of con&s;iderable regret, that a Collection of the be&s;t Modern Songs, not only the production of America, but likewi&s;e tho&s;e of Bri|tain has never before appeared on this continent.</P>
<P>To remedy which, the Editors have been at con&s;iderable labour in collecting from the mo&s;t E&s;teem'd Song Books, publi&s;h'd in Europe, a compilation, &s;uit|able in &s;ome degree to this country.</P>
<P>To this collection the Fair Americans may &s;afely have recour&s;e, without the the &s;tart of a blu&s;h upon their cheeks, or offending the mo&s;t rigid virtue; nor can the Gentlemen be more plea&s;ed by the particular attention &s;hewn to the Ladies, than by the compliment we pay to their good &s;en&s;e, in avoiding all manner of in|decent &s;ongs and <HI>double entendres.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="020930_0003_0FB14BD86CE37868">Here will be found a number of origi|nal Songs, the production of the American Mu&s;e: We are only &s;orry it has not been in our power to collect a greater number of the&s;e at the pre&s;ent time &mdash;But, providing the pre&s;ent volume meets with encouragement from the Public, the Edi|tors have it in Contemplation to Publi&s;h a Second, when, they flatter them&s;elves, they will be able to exhibit the mo&s;t of the Principal Songs wrote in the United States.&mdash;However, if in this Col|lection we have put a chearful and enter|taining Companion into the hands of the Ladies and Gentlemen of America, we tru&s;t, on their part, they will encourage the ri&s;ing arts of their native country, which will particularly oblige their very humble &s;ervants,</P>
