<HEAD>ADVICE and CAUTION FROM Our Monthly Meeting AT PHILADELPHIA.</HEAD>
<P>Held the 25th Day of the <HI>Sixth Month,</HI> 1732, <HI>Concerning Children and Servants.</HI></P>
<P>IT is an obvious and known Truth, that next to the Vigilance we ought to have over our own Con|duct, &s;o as to &s;tand accepted in the Sight of God, and to behave inoffen&s;ively and exemplarily towards Men, is the comely and nece&s;&s;ary Care for Po&s;terity, and over our Chil|dren.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003544_0002_0FF85CBCE422A410">
THIS Care is highly prudent, and an incumbent Duty, in Families, in Schools, and in Societies; for in general it may be &s;aid and expected, That the Morals and Principles which are fir&s;t imprinted will be of Duration, and if good, of great Advantage, &s;ince in the Cour&s;e of Pro|vidence, the Children of this Age are to be the People of the next.</P>
<P>REMARKABLE and grievous is the Depravity of Manners &s;o ob|&s;ervable in our Streets; &s;orrowful enough is it to &s;ee the great Encrea&s;e of Pro|phanene&s;s and Lewdne&s;s, too generally among the People of late Years, much owing to the Importation of great Num|bers of the vicious and &s;candalous Refu&s;e of other Countries. But it is yet more to be lamented by every hone&s;t Mind who wi&s;h well, and would contribute all in their Power to the Reputation, Sobriety, and future Happine&s;s of the Province, and are truely concerned for the Honour of God, and true Religion, to ob&s;erve the rude Behaviour and vile Language, u&s;ed and propogated among the Chil|dren almo&s;t as &s;oon as they can &s;peak.</P>
<P>AS this is become &s;o publick and
<PB N="3" REF="003544_0003_0FF85CBE695C64E8">
con&s;picuous an Evil, it is to be hoped, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that the well-minded and &s;ober Inhabitants of all Per|&s;ua&s;ions, may u&s;e all Diligence, and think of proper Means to redre&s;s it, for the more general the Purpo&s;e and Endeavours are, the more ea&s;ily will the good End be obtained.</P>
<P>A Concern having been for &s;ome Time on the Minds of &s;everal Friends, on this Occa&s;ion, this Meeting finds it highly nece&s;&s;ary, to make &s;ome E&s;&s;ay towards a Reformation of the Evil. And con&s;idering, that it chiefly, and almo&s;t entirely will lie upon the Heads of Families, Parents and Tutors, we recommend the Ca&s;e generally to them, and earne&s;tly pre&s;s and entreat, that they will enter more deeply and clo&s;ely into the Thoughts of their Duty, and at proper Times of Retirement, humbly and earne&s;tly implore the Divine A&s;&s;i|&s;tance, and then diligently and con&s;tantly pur&s;ue what they find to be &s;uch, with|out Wearine&s;s or Di&s;couragement at the Difficulties or Di&s;appointments they may meet with: And although much mu&s;t be left to the Vigilance and Care of 
<PB N="4" REF="003544_0004_0FF85CC1531C0F30">
tho&s;e, as Occa&s;ion may call and excite them, yet on the Part of our Community, we for the pre&s;ent recommend and advi&s;e &s;ome Methods, which we hope may contribute towards the de&s;ired Effect, and prevent much of the Di&s;order among our own.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t,</HI> That Parents do not &s;uffer an indi&s;creet and partial (and as it may prove ruinous) Fondne&s;s, to mi&s;guide their Judgments, by hearkening to, and taking Part with their Children, again&s;t the due Correction which their School-Ma&s;ters or School-Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es may u&s;e, or the Reproofs and Complaints of them, or other Friends, for their vicious or evil Behaviour, but, that Parents hear with Temper and Moderation, and where there appears ju&s;t Cau&s;e, joyn their Authority for the Reproof or Correction of their Children, avoiding to vindicate or &s;upport them with Re|&s;entment; but if they &s;hould find any Degree of Vindication or Excu&s;e to be ju&s;t, that they do it with Calmne&s;s and Prudence, and (unle&s;s the contrary be really nece&s;&s;ary) out of the Hearing of their Children.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="003544_0005_0FF85CC536EA9418">
<HI>2d,</HI> That Children be kept punctually to the Hours of School, and that at breaking up, they go directly to their re&s;pective Homes: It is de&s;ired, that both Parents, School-Ma&s;ters and School-Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es joyn their Authority and &s;trict Care in this Re&s;pect, which may prevent in good Mea&s;ure, their falling into bad Company, and evil Con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3d,</HI> That Parents be very cautious and watchful in the Liberties they give their Children, for Play or Recreation, limitting and obliging them as much as po&s;&s;ible, to Punctuality, as to Time, Place and Company; accu&s;toming them in an ea&s;y free Manner, to render true Accounts thereof; which they will be brought to do, and to receive Advice and Direction, if managed mildly, and in Love, without Brow-beating, or &s;triking Terror; unle&s;s it be on extraordinary and proper Occa|&s;ions.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4th,</HI> That School-Ma&s;ters and School-Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es do &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the Cal|ling they undertake, which con&s;i&s;ts as much in the well forming the Morals of their Pupils, inculcating Obedience 
<PB N="6" REF="003544_0006_0FF85CC6DD91C360">
to their Parents and Superiours, and generally a decent &amp; becoming Behaviour, as in a ju&s;t Care to forward and improve them in the Literature they profe&s;s to teach: Al&s;o, that they cau&s;e the Chil|dren under their Care, to come to Meet|ings, and there attend with them, order|ing them at all Times, when there is Room, to &s;it together conveniently, &s;o as they may ob&s;erve their Behaviour, taking proper Times in their Schools, to commend and encourage &s;uch as behave &s;oberly and orderly, and to reprimand and admoni&s;h tho&s;e who be|have otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5th,</HI> The great Error of giving Cor|rection rather from their own Pa&s;&s;ion, than the Import or Con&s;equence of the Fault, &s;hould be carefully avoided both by Parents and Tutors: Few Things, very few in &s;ome Children, require bodily Correction; <HI>willful</HI> and <HI>habitual Lying,</HI> and <HI>ob&s;tinate Di&s;obedience,</HI> &s;eem to be the main Faults to which that &s;hould be apply'd; to inculcate a Sen&s;e of <HI>Shame</HI> and <HI>Di&s;repute</HI> on the one hand, and a <HI>laudable Emulation</HI> on the other, is a beneficial Art in the In&s;tructor.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="7" REF="003544_0007_0FF85CC99FFE1BF8">
<HI>6th,</HI> And whereas it is apparent, that much of the Di&s;order complained of, is owing to the great Neglect in well|governing and re&s;training of Apprentices and Servants, as well as Children; and probably more &s;o, by the unrea&s;onable Liberties they take, and the ill Example they &s;hew to Children: It is therefore de&s;ired and urgently pre&s;s'd, that &s;uch of our Friends as are Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, do al&s;o con&s;ider well their Duty in that Station, e&s;pecially towards Apprentices, over whom they, in a manner, &s;tand in the Place of Parents during their Contract; and both by Example and Precept, earne&s;tly endea|vour to conduct them right in a Sen&s;e of Religion, and a &s;ober and orderly Behaviour, which, it may be hoped, will make durable Impre&s;&s;ions on them, highly beneficial in their grown State, and cau&s;e them to remember you, and the Time of their Service with Plea&s;ure and Gratitude.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Apprentices</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI> therefore, as well as <HI>Children</HI> be encouraged to go to Meetings, e&s;pecially on <HI>Fir&s;t Days,</HI> 
<PB N="8" REF="003544_0008_0FF85CCC369DDB78">
and there to &s;it &s;oberly and orderly, and &s;tay the Time; for its ob&s;erved with Grief, the Liberty taken by tho&s;e to ramble and &s;troll about Streets, and the adjacent Parts of the Town, or gather into Companies at idle or rude Sports or Games, on the fir&s;t Days of the Week, and at other Times when they are not held to Labour or Bu&s;ine&s;s, to the great Reproach of the Place, and highly &s;candalous to Sobriety and good order; and as the Magi&s;trates of the City have &s;ometimes u&s;ed Means to prevent tho&s;e and the like Di&s;orders, with a De|gree of Succe&s;s; the re&s;olute Continu|ance of their Endeavours is hoped, and it is earne&s;tly de&s;ired of all our Friends who are concerned therein, as Magi|&s;trates, Con&s;tables, or otherwi&s;e, that they contribute all in their Power, in their re&s;pective Stations, to a Reforma|tion &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and laudable; which will make the Care and Endeavours of the Heads of Families much more ea&s;y and effectual.</P>
