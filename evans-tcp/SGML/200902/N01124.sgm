<P>GOD's own vi&s;ible People are not exempt from Judgments; yea tho&s;e among them who are truly godly and dear to God, if by their &s;inful carriages they ca&s;t di&s;ho|nour upon God, and upon Religion; do expo&s;e them&s;elves to many humbling and afflictive rebukes from God in this World. Tho' their Sin be pardoned, and &s;hall not condemn them in the other World: yet God &s;ees it nece&s;&s;ary for the vindication of His own Name, and the promoting of their good, to give &s;ome publick te&s;timony of His di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t Sin. Not only &s;uch as are of a profane and
<PB N="2" REF="001341_0003_0FB280960E053008">
vicious Spirit, who&s;e carriages are an open defiance to Heaven; but many times the Sins of tho&s;e who are upright and &s;incere, do help to bring publick rebukes and judgments upon them&s;elves &amp; others. God was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed with the Impatience and Diffi|dence of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> that he excluded them out of Canaan, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.51.52. God was &s;o offended with <HI>David</HI> in the matter of <HI>&V;riah,</HI> that He brought a great deal of &s;orrow upon his Family and King|dom: So provoked with <HI>Solomon</HI> for his Connivance at, and Encouragement of the Idolatry of his Wives, as to rend away ten parts of the Kingdom of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> out of the hand of his Son. And in the Context God denounces an awful threatning again&s;t the Hou&s;e of <HI>Eli</HI> for his undue toleration and connivance at the wickedne&s;s of his Sons. Such examples &s;hould in|&s;truct us, not to be high minded but fear: Not to think our &s;elves &s;ecure becau&s;e of any vi&s;ible relation to God; but to carry a holy awe and trembling up|on our hearts, of his Holine&s;s and Jealou&s;ie, who is of purer Eyes than to look upon &s;in.</P>
<P>In the words we may take notice of three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. A &s;evere Threatning denounced again&s;t the hou&s;e of <HI>Eli, [I have told him;]</HI> by the me&s;&s;age before &s;ent to him <HI>[that I will judge:]</HI> The word &s;ignifies either to Condemn, Puni&s;h, or De&s;troy. Here it &s;eems to intend to puni&s;h. <HI>[His Hou&s;e]</HI> That is, his Fa|mily or Po&s;terity, which is often called a mans <HI>Hou&s;e. [For ever]</HI> That is, either till they are utterly wa&s;ted and con&s;umed, or rather for a long time, as the phra&s;e <HI>for ever</HI> is oft u&s;ed. This was in part fulfilled when his two Sons were &s;lain by the Phili&s;tines, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 4 11. And in part when <HI>Saul</HI> &s;lew <HI>Ahimeleck</HI> and his Fami|ly, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22.18. And finally when the Prie&s;t-hood
<PB N="3" REF="001341_0004_0FB28097B46200F0">
was tran&s;lated from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Eli,</HI> and of <HI>Ithamar,</HI> to that of <HI>Eliazar,</HI> by <HI>Solomon</HI> about Eighty years after, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 2.27.</P>
<P N="2">2. The rea&s;on of this threatning is, <HI>Becau&s;e his &s;ons made them&s;elves vile, and he re&s;trained them not.</HI> Their Sin was very horrid and prodigious, as is reported in the preceding Chapter. Their Sins were &s;uch as rendred them abominable to God, and contemptible to the People: they brought their Sacred Offices and Gods Holy Ordinances into contempt. Yet their Fa|ther did not u&s;e that Authority which God had given him as an high Prie&s;t, as a Judge or chief Magi&s;trate, in puni&s;hing them, as by the Law of God he was ob|liged to do: but contented him&s;elf with an ea&s;y and gentle reproof.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Aggravation of this Sin, which is e&s;pecially taken notice of as the immediate, procuring cau&s;e of the Judgment: <HI>For the Iniquity which he knoweth.</HI> He could not pretend Ignorance, or want of evidence, that the matter was uncertain: the cry of their wick|edne&s;s was got abroad among all I&s;rael: and God had particularly warn'd him of it by a me&s;&s;enger &s;ent to him, as you read, in <HI>Chap.</HI> 2 27 &amp; <HI>&s;equ.</HI> But though the matter was &s;o notorious, yet his Parental fondne&s;s and indulgence &s;eems to have brib'd <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> judgment that he doth not attend his Duty to God and them, in puni&s;hing of them &s;uitably to their hor|rid Guilt.</P>
<P>That is the clau&s;e in the Text that I would parti|cularly take notice of at this time, and from it you may take this Doctrine.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCT.</HI> It is Highly Offen&s;ive to God, and &s;hews Men to be very faulty; when they will not Reform what they Know to be ami&s;s.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001341_0005_0FB2809D47355E10">This Aggravated <HI>Eli</HI>'s Sin, that he knew his Sons to be vile, and did not do what he might and ought to have done to re&s;train them. Sometimes a People, and &s;o particular Per&s;ons Sin through Ignorance, they are under di&s;advantages to know the mind of God in particular ca&s;es; or el&s;e the matter is di&s;putable, its a que&s;tion to them whether the thing be a Sin: now tho' this dont wholly excu&s;e Sin, yet it le&s;&s;ens it; it is not &s;o heinous nor &s;o aggravated. But when men have &s;o much light held forth, that Sin is par|ticularly di&s;covered, and God is plainly te&s;tifying again&s;t it, and they are often confe&s;&s;ing it, yet do not &s;et them&s;elves to reform it, but per&s;i&s;t in it &s;till; this makes them very guilty before God, and &s;hews their offence to be very great. Hence it is God threatens in a peculiar manner to puni&s;h His <HI>Own</HI> People, <HI>Amos</HI> 3&punc; 2. <HI>You only have I known of all the Fami|lies of the Earth, therefore will I puni&s;h you for all your iniquities.</HI> Why is this? Not becau&s;e God loves them le&s;s than He doth other People; but becau&s;e His Name and Honour &s;uffers more by their Sins, and they being committed again&s;t more light than the Sins of others, are the more inexcu&s;able. <HI>Job.</HI> 15 22. So <HI>James</HI> 4 17. <HI>To him that knoweth to do good and doth it not, to him it is Sin.</HI> (i. e.) It is &s;o with peculiar aggravations.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t give you the confirmation of the Doctrine, and then make &s;ome Application of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Truth of it appears in this, <HI>That it di&s;covers a prevailing</HI> Love <HI>to Sin.</HI> It &s;hows that Sin hath got a great deal of power in their hearts, the more light is re&s;i&s;ted in Sinning, the &s;tronger and deeper love men have to it: their pleas and excu&s;es for it, their
<PB N="5" REF="001341_0006_0FB280A1EEACF1B0">
willingne&s;s to ju&s;tify it, their readine&s;s to roll it as a &s;weet mor&s;el under their Tongues; &s;hews their hearts to be much &s;et upon it, that it hath a great intere&s;t and activity in their affections, and this corrupts and blinds their judgments. Were there &s;uch a hatred and abhorrency of Sin, as ought to be, it would engage to watchfulne&s;s again&s;t it, and care to re&s;i&s;t it, and &s;hun Temptations when offered, and put upon endeavours to mortify it: but mens eager|ne&s;s in &s;erving it under light and conviction, is a &s;ign it hath got a great deal of power in their hearts. This rea&s;on the Apo&s;tle gives us why <HI>Balaam</HI> was &s;o &s;et to cur&s;e <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.5. <HI>He loved the Wages of &V;nrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Now to <HI>Love</HI> Sin is a bad &s;ign: Where it reigns it &s;hews a mans State to be bad. The P&s;almi&s;t gives it as the Character of a Wicked man, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 52.3. <HI>Thou</HI> Love&s;t <HI>evil more than good.</HI> When men prefer <HI>Sin</HI> before <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> in their ordinary habi|tual cour&s;e, it &s;hows their State to be bad; &s;hews the heart to be in a bad frame and very much wanting as to the Exerci&s;e of Grace, which ought to be maintained. Now <HI>Love</HI> to Sin, very much ag|gravates Sin. Joh. 3 19. <HI>This is the Condemnation that light is come into the World, and men love darkne&s;s rather than light.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It &s;hews want of Love to God; too little &s;en&s;e of and regard to Gods honour</HI> Sin is loath&s;ome and abomina|ble to God: He looks upon it with di&s;plea&s;ure and abhorrency, and it &s;hould be &s;o look'd upon by us, and be the object of our hatred and di&s;plea&s;ure. And where a &s;pirit of Love to God is kept in Exerci&s;e, it will be &s;o: they that love the Lord will hate Evil, &s;o the P&s;almi&s;t expre&s;&s;es his indignation again&s;t Sin, P&s;al. 101.3. <HI>I hate the works of &s;uch as turn a&s;ide, it &s;hall
<PB N="6" REF="001341_0007_0FB280A2C87177F0">
not cleave to me:</HI> And <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.104. <HI>I hate every fal&s;e way.</HI> If Per&s;ons have a tender re&s;pect to Gods Glory, His Name and Honour be dear to them; this will make them afraid of provoking Him, of doing any thing that will le&s;&s;en and ob&s;cure it; and make them watchful again&s;t all encroachments of Sin, and be ready to &s;ay as <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> Gen. 39.9. <HI>How can I do this great Wickedne&s;s and Sin again&s;t God?</HI> When there|fore per&s;ons per&s;evere in the practice of <HI>Known</HI> Evils; though they <HI>See</HI> Sin, are unwilling to <HI>for&s;ake</HI> it: it &s;hews either the want of <HI>Love</HI> to God, or the want of the <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of it. For if a principle of Love to God were in Exerci&s;e, Sin would be a burthen and a grief to the Soul; Holine&s;s would be de&s;ired and endeavoured after with all po&s;&s;ible means, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.23. Now this will be readily granted, that men are very much to blame either when they hant a &s;pirit of Love to God, or dont maintain it in a lively exerci&s;e and activity; for God is worthy of our Love; our be&s;t affections are due to Him, both upon account of his infinite and amiable Perfections, and his innumerable and repeated Benefits; and al&s;o becau&s;e this is the great principle of all Evangelical Obedience; nothing is well done in Religion without it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is an argument of much Deadne&s;s, Stupidity and Sleepine&s;s of Con&s;cience, that Sin can be let alone, and &s;uf|fered to lye quietly in the Heart.</HI> A tender Con&s;cience may be &s;ometimes clouded with Ignorance, and thro' mi&s;takes pa&s;s a wrong judgment in particular ca&s;es, and &s;o &s;uffer the Man to lie for a time in &s;ome Sin without Repentance; but otherwi&s;e a wakeful and tender Con&s;cience will &s;mite and condemn for Sin; it is Gods Deputy in the Soul, and will take His part, and witne&s;s for Him when His Honour is contemned,
<PB N="7" REF="001341_0008_0FB280A50465A410">
and His Law violated. When <HI>David</HI> had but cut off the skirt of <HI>Sauls</HI> robe, pre&s;ently his heart &s;mote him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.5 When <HI>Peter</HI> remembred the words of Chri&s;t, he went out and wept bitterly, <HI>Math.</HI> 26 75. A &s;en&s;ible Con&s;cience, will fill the Soul with di&s;qui|eting accu&s;ations, and make it unea&s;y under the bur|then of its own guilt, and re&s;tle&s;s to be delivered from it, and from the burthen&s;ome and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing effects and con&s;equents of it: and therefore will put upon the u&s;e of proper means for it. When the Apo&s;tle had &s;tir'd up the Con&s;ciences of the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> to reflect upon their Sinful connivance at the Ince&s;tuous Per&s;on among them, and their pride and unhumbled Spirit, not mourning for and over him; you &s;ee how it wrought in them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.11. They could have no re&s;t till they were throughly clear of it, and had by unfeigned Repentance te&s;tifyed their di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t it. Now it is every ones unque&s;tionable duty, to get and keep a tender Con&s;cience; and their Sin, to give way to Security and Sleepine&s;s of Con&s;cience, for when &s;uch a frame of heart prevails, it &s;hews a carele&s;s, unwatchful, unthinking heart; the want of a due &s;en&s;e of Gods un&s;potted Holine&s;s, and Puri|ty, and the certainty of his Righteous Judgment; the want of care to plea&s;e God and approve their hearts to Him in a holy Conver&s;ation. Yea, if Con&s;cience be &s;uffered to fall a&s;leep, the Soul lies like a Town unguarded, ready to be a prey to an approaching E|nemy: Satan ea&s;ily gets an advantage over &s;uch, many &s;ad breaches are made in the Peace of their Souls, and many defilements contracted, to their un|&s;peakable prejudice.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Becau&s;e it &s;hews a greater Voluntarine&s;s and Free|dom in Sinning.</HI> Such dont Sin through inadvertency,
<PB N="8" REF="001341_0009_0FB280A6ACC5DA60">
or from the &s;udden &s;urprizal of Temptation; but with more deliberation. Now the more freely men commit Sin, and the more of the con&s;ent of the Will there is in it, the more vile it is. It di&s;covers a very bad &s;tate or frame of heart, that men have lo&s;t in a great mea&s;ure the &s;en&s;e of Gods Authority, and the awe of His Judgment: and therefore &s;uch Sins are the more heinous and offen&s;ive to God: Joh. 15 22. <HI>If I had not come and &s;poken to them, they had had no Sin, but now they have no cloak for their Sin.</HI> The coming in of &s;o much Light, made their Sin inexcu&s;able, and took away all pleas and pretences, they had to excu&s;e or cover it before. They cant &s;ay they did not know it was Sin, or that it was a thing &s;o offen&s;ive to God, or would be of &s;uch a dangerous tendency to them&s;elves. The coming in of Light di&s;covers the&s;e things to them. Hence Chri&s;t tells us, that &s;uch Sins expo&s;e to greater Judgment: Luk. 12.47. <HI>The Servant that knew his Lords will and prepared not him&s;elf to do according to it, &s;hall be beaten with many &s;tripes.</HI> And as hereafter it expo&s;es to a &s;orer Condemnation, &s;o at pre&s;ent, when-ever the Con&s;cience of a Sinner comes to be awakened, the remembrance of the Light that hath been re&s;i&s;ted, the warnings and convictions that have been &s;lighted; makes deep wounds in the Con&s;cience, and procures many heart-piercing fears, and agonies of Spirit. Its great folly for any to ex|po&s;e them&s;elves to the&s;e di&s;quiets of Con&s;cience, by giving way to &s;uch Con&s;cience-wa&s;ting Sins.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Becau&s;e it &s;hews, that there is but little Dread upon their hearts of Gods Judgments, either felt or threatned.</HI> Sin expo&s;es men to the ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure of a Holy &amp; Righteous God; and He is many times in His Provi|dences revealing His wrath again&s;t the ungodline&s;s

and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men, and expects that the&s;e things &s;hould be an awe upon their hearts, and be a means to re&s;train them from adventuring any long|er in their impenitency: But when his Wrath is not made vi&s;ible in the <HI>Puni&s;hments</HI> of Sin; yet it is al|ways di&s;covered in his <HI>Threatnings</HI> again&s;t it, and hangs like a flaming Sword over the head of a Sin|ner. The&s;e &s;hould be an awe to Per&s;ons and make them afraid of expo&s;ing them&s;elves to Divine Ju&s;tice: &s;o they have been to &s;ome. <HI>David,</HI> &s;aid, P&s;al 119.120. <HI>My fle&s;h trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</HI> And <HI>Job</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Chap.</HI> 31.23. <HI>De&s;truction from God was a terror to me, and by rea&s;on of his high|ne&s;s I could not endure.</HI> And it &s;hould be &s;o with o|thers: God requires men, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 4 4. <HI>Stand in awe and &s;in not.</HI> And &s;aid, I&s;a. 26.9. <HI>When his Judgments are abroad in the earth, the inhabitants of the World will learn righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Corrections &s;hould be in&s;tructive, we &s;hould learn the evil of Sin by them, and be a|fraid of continuing in it. If there were any &s;uitable awe of the Ju&s;tice, or Truth of God upon the heart, any &s;en&s;e of the terriblene&s;s of his di&s;plea&s;ure, and what a fearful thing it is to be the &s;orrowful &s;ubject of his Threatnings or Judgments, it would be &s;o. Tho&s;e therefore are very much to blame, who&s;e hearts are glued &s;o fa&s;t to their Lu&s;ts and Idols; that rather than part with them, will &s;light their own Mercies, and expo&s;e them&s;elves to the Wrath and Jealou&s;ly of a Sin revenging God. And though Knowing the Judgment of God in his threatnings or providences, will not be check'd or re&s;train'd by it.</P>

<P><PB N="10" REF="001341_0011_0FB280B044EA9B20">USE I. <HI>This &s;hews us that a People under the pre|vailing of an &V;nreformed Spirit, are many times more Culpable in the &s;ight of God, than they are aware.</HI> Not only the Evils that prevail among them, are in them|&s;elves, and in their own nature, very offen&s;ive to God: but their not improving the light held forth to them, for their Conviction and Reformation; ren|ders their Sin very culpable, and highly aggravated in the &s;ight of God.

Now this is a great degree of it, when they with&s;tand means of Conviction, dont hearken to the voice of Gods Warnings or Judg|ments; when they Plead for Sin, and are unwilling to Repent, Reform and Turn to God unfeignedly. To be of &s;uch a &s;pirit, as to &s;light Reproofs, and contemn Reprovers, is a very bad E&s;tate. Its bad enough when the hearts of a People are gone off from God, and &s;et upon their Lu&s;ts: but it is wor&s;e, when they will Not return; but per&s;evere in their evil ways.</P>
<P>USE. II. <HI>May be to Warn you that you dont re&s;i&s;t the Light, that &s;hould di&s;cover your</HI> Sin, <HI>and bring you to your</HI> Duty. It is a dangerous thing to neglect to Reform what you <HI>Know</HI> to be ami&s;s: there's a great deal of Sin in it, and it expo&s;es tho&s;e who are guilty of it, to many Judgments. <HI>Eli</HI> had been before now warned of the wickedne&s;s of his Sons; but his Sinful Indulgence towards them blinded him: and here God tells him, <HI>He will Judge his hou&s;e for ever.</HI> So the Pro|phet declares again&s;t <HI>Amaziah,</HI> 2 Chron 25 16 <HI>I know God hath determined to de&s;troy thee, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t done this, and hast not hearkened to my coun&s;el.</HI> Not|with&s;tanding evident te&s;timonies from God, men do &s;ometimes harden their hearts: and by per&s;i&s;ting in Sin, expo&s;e them&s;elves to <HI>Spiritual, Temporal,</HI> and <HI>Eter|nal</HI> Judgments. I will mind you of &s;ome of the ways whereby Per&s;ons do &s;ometimes do it; that you may be cautioned again&s;t them.</P>

But this is no &s;ufficient vindication. If the thing be in its nature or under &s;uch circum&s;tances, evil; the practice of others, will not make it good, how many or who|&s;oever they be. You know that good men have their failings, and in many things carry corruptly. But be&s;ides, all are not good men, that are taken to be &s;o. Many that the World calls <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> Knowing men; are and will be found <HI>Fools</HI> at la&s;t: but if they are never &s;o good, or wi&s;e; you mu&s;t follow none any farther than they follow CHRIST, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.1. <HI>Precepts</HI> mu&s;t be your Rule, not <HI>Examples: I&s;a.</HI> 8.20.

But the&s;e pretences are ordinarily from the deceitfulne&s;s of Sin; or the efficacy of Satan, to harden the heart; there's no ju&s;t rea&s;on for them. Our duty, when reproved, is &s;eriou&s;ly to examine the ca&s;e, if the Word of God condemns the practice, that's &s;ufficient to deter us from it; for it is by this that God will ju&s;tify, or condemn us.</P>

So &s;he makes this a cloak for her wickedne&s;s, Prov. 7.14. <HI>I have Peace-offerings with me, this day I have performed my Vows.</HI> Thus carnal Chri&s;tians re&s;t upon their Ex|ternal &s;hews of Devotions, becau&s;e they attend the Wor&s;hip of God in Publick, Pray in their Families, and the like, that therefore God will excu&s;e their Im|moralities: They tru&s;t in their righteou&s;ne&s;s and commit iniquity, as in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.13. But alas the&s;e things do rather aggravate, than at all excu&s;e Sin; and &s;how that men know their duty.

practiced? We live in a land of <HI>Light,</HI> have great ad|vantages to know the mind of God, to know how we &s;hould adorn the Go&s;pel, and our profe&s;&s;ion of it. The Grace of God toward us, both as to Light and Peace under Go&s;pel Privileges, is very peculiar and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing. And altho' there may be Errors in practice that ari&s;e thro' Ignorance, and inadvertency: and &s;ome points that are di&s;putable, that per&s;ons are not &s;o well &s;atisfyed about. Yet &s;urely, the Evils of this Country are for the mo&s;t part in &s;uch things as are <HI>Known,</HI> yea &s;uch as have been often <HI>Acknowledged;</HI> &s;ometimes in a more Publick manner, both by Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Rulers: and often in a general way upon &s;uch days as this. It is not the want of <HI>Light,</HI> but the want of <HI>Improving,</HI> and <HI>Submitting</HI> to the Light that we have, that retards the Reformation, which hath been &s;o long called for. Let me pro&s;ecute this Expo&s;tulation in the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As to the great Duty of Improving Sea&s;ons &amp; Means of Grace, unto a Repentance from Dead Works, Faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to a getting into a Converted and Pardoned Estate, while the Patience and long-&s;uffering of God is continued:</HI> Is not this a thing abundantly Known and Confe&s;&s;ed? Certainly Per&s;ons that have been bred up under the Calls of the Go&s;pel, and have had the duties of it &s;o frequently inculcated upon them, cant be ignorant of the&s;e things. The word is plain and po&s;itive concerning them pre&s;&s;ing a pre&s;ent Repen|tance and Conver&s;ion to God, I&s;a. 55 67 <HI>Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him whil&s;t he is near.

And how plainly doth it warn of the danger of neg|lecting
<PB N="18" REF="001341_0019_0FB280C1895DFAD0">
it: Heb. 2.3. <HI>How &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect &s;o great Salvation?</HI> There will be no e&s;caping or avoid|ing the fore&s;t condemnation. God &s;hows the riches of his Grace in affording the Sea&s;ons of Grace unto men; the&s;e are not to be &s;lighted and trifled away; but &s;e|riou&s;ly, &s;ea&s;onably, and faithfully improved. It is a great di&s;honour ca&s;t upon Chri&s;t, and contempt of the Love of God in the work of Redemption, when Peace and Reconciliation with him, are not regarded; when the fruits of redeeming love in Sanctification, and Ho|line&s;s, are counted a <HI>Mi&s;ery,</HI> rather than a <HI>Privilege.</HI> It is a daring pre&s;umption, as well as po&s;itive Di&s;obe|dience, when God calls for <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Repentance &amp; Con|ver&s;ion, to defer the matter to <HI>future</HI> care. Surely, men know it is their duty to put Honour upon the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, to acknowledge him in his Office of a Re|deemer. Surely it is fit that He, who hath been at the expence of his precious Blood, undergone &s;uch aba&s;e|ment, and &s;ufferings; &s;hould be glorious in the Eyes of tho&s;e to whom he is offered; and the fruits of his Redeeming love, be received with all Thankfulne&s;s. This is plainly required. <HI>Joh</HI> 5.23. He will have all men honour the Son as they honour the Father: and how is Chri&s;t honoured, if he be not believed in, and obeyed? <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.23. <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.9 Doth not every one con|fe&s;s that there is no other way of Salvation but this which God hath con&s;ecrated through faith in his Blood? Yet alas how many are there who neglect the&s;e great duties; Live in impenitency, and unbelief, are very little concerned to obtain a real Union with Chri&s;t, &amp; Communion in the Benefits of Redemption; make no great matter of letting &s;lip the Sea&s;ons of Grace; feel no Mi&s;ery in their E&s;trangement from God, captivity to Sin, and Satan; dont groan after

<P N="2">2. <HI>As to the Means of Wor&s;hip which God hath appointed, whether Publick, Private, or Secret.</HI> Certainly, the Omi&s;|&s;ions of them that are among us, are not through Ig|norance Men know and confe&s;s that God is the Supreme and fir&s;t Being, the fountain of Goodne&s;s; &amp; thence the proper object of Wor&s;hip; that all our Mer|cies flow from Him; &s;hould be ask'd by Prayer, and acknowledged with Prai&s;e. As to the <HI>Secret Duties</HI> of Wor&s;hip, how plain is the Precept, Mat. 6 6 <HI>When thou praye&s;t, Enter into thy clo&s;et, and when thou ha&s;t &s;hut thy door, Pray to thy Father which is in Secret.</HI> &amp;c. Every man hath Per&s;onal Wants, Sins, and Temptations; many concerns that are mo&s;t fit to be tran&s;acted in Se|cret between God and his own Soul; therefore, to O|mit it, is both an act of Di&s;obedience to God. &amp; a great prejudice to your Selves. Yet, are there not &s;uch who are Strangers to this Duty? can &s;eldom find time to con|ver&s;e with God in Secret Duties; can often Sin in Secret; be Wanton, Unju&s;t, Intemperate, in Secret; but dont Pray in Secret: And as to the Publick Wor&s;hip of God, how plainly hath God enjoyned the &s;everal parts of it? And particularly, that very much neglected Ordinance of the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> obliging all his Di&s;ciples to do it in Remembrance of Him, <HI>Luk.</HI> 22 19 That they might keep up a thankful Memorial of the Death of Chri&s;t, and the great Ends of it; and re&s;tify their dependance upon him for the ble&s;&s;ings purcha&s;ed by it.

Such Per&s;ons will be very inexcu&s;a|ble in the Day of Chri&s;t. You pretend a zeal for Chri&s;ts In&s;titutions, and commend your Fore-fathers that ventured their blood to re&s;cue your Ordinances from Popi&s;h corruptions; and yet when you may attend it in Go&s;pel Purity, turn your backs upon it!</P>

The great concern of upholding Religion, and Propaga|ting of it to &s;ucceding Generations &s;hould be a pre&s;&s;ing encouragement hereunto. The Work of Chri&s;t in our Towns and Churches, will &s;oon langui&s;h, if this be neglected: they will be like unpoli&s;h'd Stones, unfit to be laid in any building; if a vertuous and pious E|ducation be neglected. The pre&s;ent, &s;orrowful State of many of our Children, &s;natch'd from us and expo&s;ed to a Popi&s;h and Heatheni&s;h Education, &s;hould awaken to &s;erious reflections whether among other ju&s;t rea&s;ons for it, God may not be pointing at this neglect.

The word of God doth this more e&s;pecially, not only witne&s;&s;ing again&s;t the gro&s;&s;er acts of it, in noto|rious <HI>Drunkenne&s;s,</HI> and &s;hameful Spewing: but all the tendencies that way; and the occa&s;ions of and induce|ments to it; forbiding men to tarry long at the wine, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.20. Yea, not &s;o much as to look upon it when it gives its colour in the Cup, and moves it &s;elf aright, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23 31. (if &s;uch a &s;ight proves a temptation) and denounces a Woe again&s;t tho&s;e that are Strong to drink Wine, and men of Strength to mingle Strong drink, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 5.22. That can pour down cup after cup, without being intoxicated, and bereft of the exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on. And doth not the Go&s;pel more e&s;pecially re|quire men to live Soberly, <HI>Titus</HI> 2.12, 13. To govern their Appetites as to Meat &amp; Drink; &amp; are not &s;ome under &s;pecial engagements, not to frequent Taverns, or give way to an inordinate affection to Strong Drink? If yet any act contrary hereunto, and needle&s;ly &s;pend away their Time and E&s;tates, in indulging a Tipling humour, and gratifying the inordinacy of their Appe|tites;
<PB N="24" REF="001341_0025_0FB280CCBA759F38">
to the wounding of their Con&s;ciences; quench|ing their convictions; di&s;honouring their Profe&s;&s;ion; impoveri&s;hing of their Families; and refu&s;e to be re|formed, as is the deplorable ca&s;e of &s;ome, that will certainly be found very culpable before God, and al|together inexcu&s;able: The&s;e things with others of the like nature (that might have been named) are too &s;ad evidences of a great abu&s;e of Light that hath been afforded.</P>
<P>USE. IV. <HI>Of EXHORTATION, Be per&s;wad|ed then to Reform tho&s;e things that you</HI> Know <HI>to be ami&s;s, and are plainly di&s;covered to be Sins:</HI> If you neglect this, there will be ju&s;t cau&s;e to fear that Gods di&s;plea&s;ure will be continued, and increa&s;ed. God is as angry with mens Pride and Stubbornne&s;s in contempt of his Warnings, as formerly. Its a dangerous thing for a People again&s;t whom God hath a controver&s;y, to de|lay their Repentance, and to continue the cau&s;es of his anger. For as it is with particular Per&s;ons, &s;o it is with a People; God limits the time of his patience, how long He will wait before the decree &s;hall bring forth, and his wrath break out, till there be no remedy. Our Wi&s;dom therefore is to take up the matter quickly, as in <HI>Numb.</HI> 16.49. To remove what we <HI>Know</HI> is Evil; and to &s;earch out what <HI>we know not.</HI> In particular, I would here &s;ay.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Reform &s;uch things as your own</HI> Con&s;ciences <HI>tell you are ami&s;s, and do often &s;mite and condemn you for.</HI> Con&s;cience is Gods Monitor in your brea&s;ts, and you &s;hould li&s;ten to it (as you would to a me&s;&s;enger from Heaven) when it warns you of Evil committed, or Duty neglected. Is not Con&s;cience often &s;miting of you? Sometimes when you hear Sin reproved, and
<PB N="25" REF="001341_0026_0FB280D387D32C80">
&s;ometimes when a day of di&s;tre&s;s and affliction comes; when you think Death and Judgment are near. Are there not many inward di&s;quietments, and perplexing thoughts ari&s;ing in your hearts? Are there not &s;ecret Re&s;olutions to avoid tho&s;e Evils, or do tho&s;e duties that Con&s;cience deals with you about? Oh then obey the voice of Con&s;cience in the&s;e things, whatever it be that it witne&s;&s;es to, dont &s;light or &s;mother it, and with|&s;tand the checks of it: If you dont carry kindly to|wards it as a friend; you mu&s;t expect that it will &s;hortly carry towards you as an enraged Enemy, and will dreadfully upbraid you for the violence done to it: <HI>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</HI> Prov 18.14.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Reform what you often</HI> Confe&s;s <HI>to be Ami&s;s.</HI> Doubt|le&s;s, be&s;ides Publick Prayers, and &s;olemn Confe&s;&s;ions, that are made on &s;uch Days as this, wherein we are uttering many things again&s;t our &s;elves, for the vindi|cation of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in the things He hath brought upon us: I &s;ay&punc; be&s;ides the&s;e, God hath your particular and per&s;onal Confe&s;&s;ions, in the daily Prayers that you make. How often are you bewailing the Mi&s;pen&s;e of Time; abu&s;e of the Sea&s;ons &amp; Means of Grace; Unthankfulne&s;s for Go&s;pel Mercies; Bar|renne&s;s, and Unprofitablene&s;s under Divine Cultivati|ons; the neglect of government over your Spirits and Pa&s;&s;ions; inordinate affection to the things of the World; and a too great indifferency and coldne&s;s in the things of God and your own Salvation? Now will you not be &s;elf-condemned, if notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Confe&s;&s;ions, the&s;e things are &s;till continued! How &s;ad is it, when a mans Prayers &s;erve only for a te&s;timo|ny of his hypocri&s;ies! And evidence the deceitfulne&s;s of his heart in the religious &s;hows that he makes. If there were a hearty Sorrow for &s;uch Evils, and a due
<PB N="26" REF="001341_0027_0FB280D62B1DC010">
&s;en&s;e of them; it would be manife&s;ted in a &s;erious in|deavour, both to reform, and mortify them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Reform &s;uch things as are plainly Witne&s;&s;ed against from the</HI> Word of God. You all confe&s;s the Word of God to be the Rule according to which our Lives and Actions &s;hould be ordered: that it is to be our Guide, as to matters of In&s;titution, and as to moral duties; Truth, Ju&s;tice, Temperance, Charity, Mode&s;ty, and the like. When ever therefore your Duty laid down in it, is cleared up from it in the Mini&s;try &s;o plainly that your Con&s;ciences cant gain-&s;ay it; be careful that you dont with&s;tand any &s;uch Coun&s;el, or Me&s;&s;age from God to you. <HI>David</HI> &s;aith, P&s;al. 119 161. &mdash; <HI>My heart &s;tandeth in awe of thy word.</HI> God looks with a gracious re&s;pect to tho&s;e that tremble at his Word, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 66 2. When any <HI>Duty</HI> is enforced by it, or <HI>Sin</HI> condem|ned, we &s;hould &s;ubmit to it with reverence, and thank|fulne&s;s. It is not matter of <HI>Liberty,</HI> whether you will receive, or reject the Commands of God; but what God requires, <HI>Mu&s;t</HI> be cheerfully &s;ubmitted to. In|deed, where matters are di&s;putable or dark to them, there it is mens duty to enquire to labour to have their doubts re&s;olved: but where matters are plain, and un|que&s;tionable; as in duties of <HI>Love</HI> to God, and Men, e&s;pecially in Moral Precepts &amp; &s;uch things as all agree to be duties; and a mans own Con&s;cience cant gain-&s;ay it: if in &s;uch ca&s;es men dont hearken to the voice of God, He will &s;urely require it of them. To inforce this Exhortation, I &s;hall add the&s;e following Con&s;ide|rations</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The neglecting to Reform what you</HI> Know <HI>to be Ami&s;s, will argue you to be guilty of great</HI> Hypocri&s;y <HI>in your &s;o|lemn tran&s;actions with God on &s;uch days as the&s;e.</HI> Tis a thing confe&s;&s;ed, that days of <HI>Humiliation</HI> without <HI>Re|formation,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="001341_0028_0FB280D799EE2730">
are not acceptable to God; but rather days of <HI>Provocation, I&s;ai.</HI> 58.5, 6, 7. There is not that Hu|miliation, Repentance, brokenne&s;s of Heart for Sin, humble waiting upon God for Mercy, as ought to be: but men put off God with empty &s;hows, and external devotions, which rather heighten, than moderate his anger. If there were a &s;erious de&s;ire, and engagedne&s;s of Heart to be reconciled to God; they would be wil|ling to remove what lyes as a bar in the way to it; did men count Sin to be &s;o bad, as they profe&s;s it to be; certainly they would be willing to let it go. To pre|tend to de&s;ire <HI>Peace,</HI> and Atonement with God, and to neglect the <HI>Terms</HI> upon which He offers it: what is this but to act hypocritically? To cry for favour &amp; pardoning Mercy; and perpetuate the grounds of Gods controver&s;y: what is this but to mock God, to flatter Him with your lips, while your hearts are far from Him? it evidently &s;hows the carnality, and &s;elf|i&s;hne&s;s of mens hearts, in &s;uch Prayers: Hos 7.14. <HI>They a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves for corn and wine, and they rebel again&s;t me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Con&s;ider what lo&s;ers you have been, and are &s;till like to be, by not Reforming the Evils God hath witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t.</HI> It is confe&s;&s;ed, that the <HI>Sins</HI> of Gods profe&s;&s;ing People, are the <HI>Provoking Cau&s;es</HI> of their calamities: Micah 1 5. <HI>For the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of Jacob is all this, and for the &s;in of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</HI> Idolatry, Oppre&s;&s;ion, and neglect of Gods Wor&s;hip prevaild; and that brought on a|bundance of Mi&s;ery. It is the abounding of <HI>Iniquities</HI> among us, that hath made way for the many <HI>Rebukes</HI> of Heaven, that we have been under: and neglecting to be reformed, hath continued them; our own ex|perience may convince us, what lo&s;ers we have been hereby: we have for&s;aken God to our Lo&s;s. Is not
<PB N="28" REF="001341_0029_0FB280D966A50930">
much of the pre&s;ence of God lo&s;t? His gracious &s;piri|tual pre&s;ence in His <HI>Ordinances,</HI> and His protecting Pre&s;ence in His <HI>Providences:</HI> what lo&s;&s;es in your Out|ward comforts; in your Liberties, E&s;tates, Families? Men have been violent to &s;erve their Lu&s;ts; &amp; have &s;marted &s;orely for it. And is it like to be otherwi&s;e &s;till? Can we expect that God will change the methods of his Providences, if there be no change for the better in us? Jer. 7.5, 6, 7. <HI>If ye thorowly amend your ways, and your doing; &mdash; Then I will cau&s;e you to dwell in this place,</HI> &amp;c. God is immutably Ju&s;t and Holy. If our carriages are changed; then we become meet &s;ubjects for His Mercy to be exalted upon. Surely then the bitter fruits of Sin &s;hould make every one willing to for&s;ake it: Surely, it is time to grow wi&s;er, to &s;ay as <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 2.7. &mdash; <HI>I will go and return to my first Husband, for then was it better with me then now.</HI> Some men think to advance them&s;elves by Sin; to get E&s;tates, &amp; rai&s;e their Families, by Inju&s;tice, Oppre&s;&s;ion, and a violent pur&s;uit of the World: but they con&s;ult &s;hame to their hou&s;e. What are men like to get by greedine&s;s, in|temperance, &s;otti&s;h neglects of their Souls, and the great Salvation provided for them thro' Chri&s;t; but &s;orrow here, and eternal ruine at the la&s;t?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If you Reform what you</HI> Know <HI>to be Ami&s;s; it will give ground to hope that God will &s;hew you what you know not.</HI> Some are asking, Wherein &s;hall we return? If this que&s;tion be &s;erious; Surely, &s;uch will reform what they do <HI>Know</HI> to be Evil: if otherwi&s;e, they act like them in the Prophet, <HI>Exek</HI> 14.3, 4.7. And expo&s;e them&s;elves by their mocking of God, to greater Judg|ments. But God is ready to <HI>Teach</HI> tho&s;e that are wil|ling <HI>to Do</HI> their Duty, <HI>Joh.</HI> 7 17. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3 15, 16 <HI>Job</HI> Prays with the more confidence, <HI>Chap.</HI> 34 32. That
<PB N="29" REF="001341_0030_0FB280DA421D6990">
God would teach him what he knows not; while he re&s;olves, that wherein he hath done iniquity, he will do &s;o no more.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>Thus to do, will give hope, that God will have a gracious re&s;pect to our Prayers this Day.</HI> For God doth not begrutch <HI>Mercies</HI> to His People, if they are but <HI>Obedient:</HI> I&s;a. 1.19. <HI>If ye be willing and obedient, ye &s;hall eat the good of the land.</HI> We have very great and weighty Reque&s;ts to pre&s;ent before God this day; That God would ble&s;s Our Sovereign, and our Na|tion; &s;mile upon their Warlike Preparations; &s;till honour them with Succe&s;s and Victory; give Enlarge|ment to His Church; and a Revival to the Oppre&s;|&s;ed, Per&s;ecuted Members of it; would pre&s;erve our Land from the incur&s;ions of Adver&s;aries; would ble&s;s, guide and pro&s;per our Military Forces; that He would remember &amp; re&s;tore our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Captives. Surely, there is no con&s;idering Per&s;on, but accounts it would be a &s;ingular Mercy, if our Prayers for the&s;e things, might be accepted at the Throne of Grace. And will you not be prevaild with &s;o far, as to part with your Sins, that you may obtain the&s;e Mercies? Oh that you would con&s;ider it! Were it not better to part with the deare&s;t Lu&s;t, than to be an <HI>Achan</HI> to trouble our <HI>I&s;rael</HI> at &s;uch a day as this? How rea&s;onable are Gods demands! When he calls men to deny Ungod|line&s;s, and Worldly Lu&s;ts; to live Soberly, Righte|ou&s;ly, and Godly in this pre&s;ent World; to love God, and love one another; and e&s;pecially, to love your own Souls, by being throughly careful to Redeem time, and improve all helps, to &s;ecure the happine&s;s of them in Chri&s;t, while the day of Salvation is conti|nued; to turn to Him by a thorow Repentance, and
<PB N="30" REF="001341_0031_0FB280DBC07C4C50">
acknowledgement of our offences, and a humble ap|plication to the blood of the Covenant, that God would Pardon our Sins, and heal our Land. God requires no compen&s;ation for the wrongs we have done Him; no requitals for his injured Name and Glory, which hath &s;uffered &s;o much by us. But if you will return to Him with all your hearts, accept His Re|deeming Grace, and re&s;ign your &s;elves to His Service in Sincerity, He will be gracious and prevent us with ble&s;&s;ings of goodne&s;s: Zech. 1.3. &mdash; <HI>Turn ye unto me, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, and I will turn unto you, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts.</HI> And can any be unwilling to this? Many are ready to &s;ay, They would be willing to part with many Pounds of their E&s;tates; yea to venture their Lives, that they might enjoy peaceable dayes again: And will you not part with your Lu&s;ts for it? Abridge your &s;elves of Unlawful Liberties, be humble and holy that you may obtain it! <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 50. <HI>ult. &mdash; To him that ordereth his conver&s;ation aright, will I &s;hew the Salvation of GOD.</HI></P>
