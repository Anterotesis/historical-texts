<HEAD>THE TRIAL OF JEAN BAPTISTE LACOMBE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">IN THE NAME OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC, ONE AND INDIVISIBLE.</HEAD>
<P>The Special Military Commi&s;&s;ion, e&s;tabli&s;hed at Bourdeaux, by a deci&s;ion of the Repre&s;entative of the People YSABEAU, bearing the date of ye&s;terday, in order to try LACOMBE, and his Accomplices&mdash;has pa&s;&s;ed the following Sentence: to which have a&s;&s;i&s;ted, Citizens LATASTE, Pre&s;ident; A. FRIGIERE, SEGUY, AZEVEDO, and CLOCHARD, members of the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THEY brought to the bar, a man who called him&s;elf Jean Bapti&s;t Lacombe, a native of Toulou&s;e, having his domicil in Bourdeaux, di&s;|trict of the &s;ame in the department of Bec d' Am|be's; the &s;aid man about 35 years old; formerly a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, and pre&s;ident to the late mili|tary commi&s;&s;ion at Bourdeaux.</P>

Citizen DEREY, war commi&s;&s;ary and public accu&s;er, &s;aid:</P>
<P>CITIZENS,</P>
<P>Lacombe, is accu&s;ed of having perpetrated the mo&s;t horrid crimes, and that under the ma&s;k of all virtues. The papers of the proce&s;s will prove, that nobody ever betrayed &s;o boldly the confidence of the people, and of its repre&s;enta|tives; that the di&s;charge of judicial duty, was never &s;o &s;hamefully abu&s;ed, the&s;e papers will prove that a greater criminal, did never fix up|on him&s;elf the attention of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The&s;e papers are numerous; time has been &s;hort to read them, and to compare together the facts they contain. I could &s;carcely copy the re&s;ult of them; but the public is con&s;umed with the thir&s;t of ju&s;tice; it is important to yield to its impatience; this impatience is that of republican virtues: The people want a great example of &s;everity, let this example be granted.</P>
<P>The papers were read, after which the pub|lic accu&s;er &s;poke again as follows:</P>
<P>CITIZENS,</P>
<P>You have ju&s;t heard the reading of the docu|ments of the proce&s;s; they exhibit to you the mo&s;t hideous picture; you &s;ee thereby Lacombe,
<PB N="7" REF="028941_0005_0FDDB66949CBACD8">
to be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively a &s;hark, a prevaricating ma|gi&s;trate, a counter-revolutioni&s;t, and always a hypocrite.</P>
<P>Let us follow him in the three periods of his life, in order that we may form to our&s;elves a ju&s;t idea of his ba&s;ene&s;s, and of the wickedne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>What has been his conduct previous to the re|volution? How did he behave him&s;elf &s;ince the revolution, and before his getting in the office of pre&s;ident of the military commi&s;&s;ion? How did he behave him&s;elf in the various emergencies of this duty?</P>
<P>What has been his conduct previous to the revolution? He him&s;elf informs us that he was born in Toulou&s;e; he &s;ays that he followed there the line of a teacher, and that he came to &s;ettle in Bourdeaux, about ten years ago.</P>
<P>Lacombe a tutor! What man is this to teach youth the principles of morality, to unfold in their minds the &s;eeds of the virtues therein &s;ow|ed by nature!</P>
<P>He was twenty eight years old when he came to Bourdeaux: He was married. His wife de|clared
<PB N="8" REF="028941_0006_0FDDB66D5F10E180">
that they were poor at Toulou&s;e, and that, on their arriving at Bourdeaux, they had got but a little money along with their cloaths. What!&mdash;Lacombe who had been &s;ucce&s;sful at Toulou&s;e in the line of a teacher, was deprived of almo&s;t everything when he arrived at Bor|deaux.</P>
<P>But, citizens, a fact which ought to have fixed your attention, in&s;pires us with the mo&s;t unfa|vorable &s;u&s;picions concerning his fame in Tou|lou&s;e. He left, doubtle&s;s, Toulou&s;e on the on|ly account of his being there too publicly known, and he came to Bourdeaux, becau&s;e the population, commerce and opulency of this im|portant city, unhappily warrant to an intriguing man more re&s;ources and more means to conceal the ba&s;ene&s;s of his actions, and to impo&s;e upon others: Recall to your minds the declaration of citizen Merzeau, one of the mo&s;t ancient, of the mo&s;t &s;incere and mo&s;t virtuous republicans. You have &s;een Lacombe to partake of the theft of a carriage from Colineau, a coach-maker on Tourny-walks; you have &s;een him to partake of a theft of books 1800 livers worth from Ducot a book&s;eller; you have &s;een him accompanied by a fellow, who acted the part of an Engli&s;h Lord, in order to impo&s;e more ea&s;ily both upon the coach-maker and book&s;eller; you have after|wards
<PB N="9" REF="028941_0007_0FDDB66F033D6FF0">
&s;een him &s;tealing linens, worth 800 livres, from citizen Merzeau; and how did he &s;teal the&s;e linens? In order to impo&s;e upon citizen Merzeau, he &s;ent his wife, elegantly dre&s;&s;ed in a coach, and &s;he picked out and carried away the&s;e linens. It is thus that this tutor, who had obtained great &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Toulou&s;e, did ground his new &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Bourdeaux; it is thus that he taught his family the art of craf|tine&s;s and knavery; it is thus that, by mi&s;u&s;ing the weakne&s;s of his wife, he made her an ac|complice of his criminal ba&s;ene&s;s! The&s;e facts, and a thou&s;and others, with which the public voice reproaches him, &s;how clearly enough what man Lacombe was, previous to the revo|lution. Let us &s;ee what he has been &s;ince that epoch.</P>
<P>Every one is &s;en&s;ible that there are every where intriguers, impo&s;ters and atrocious men, who took up the revolutionary ma&s;k to veil their plots, to deceive the people and its repre&s;enta|tives, to get in the public offices, and to cru&s;h liberty to pieces.</P>
<P>There is no liberty without virtue; there is no liberty where licentiou&s;ne&s;s is; but alas! How &s;hall we have this republican principle adopted by men, who&s;e whole country's love con&s;i&s;ts but
<PB N="10" REF="028941_0008_0FDDB6705FEAE600">
in the violence of their declamations! By men who cry aloud for the only purpo&s;e of impo&s;ing upon the candour and credulity of a generous and tru&s;tful public; by men who are always &s;peaking about republicani&s;m, and who &s;helter in their hearts all the furies of de&s;poti&s;m; by men who &s;peak of virtue, and have their hearts &s;tained by the mo&s;t hideous vices; by men who talk of liberty, to fetter and &s;lave their fellow-citizens?</P>
<P>In the year 1790, Lacombe kept a boarding-&s;chool, in a hou&s;e rented to him by citizen Li&s;|leferme; he bought from a widow woman, &s;ix or &s;even tuns of wine, for the u&s;e, &s;aid he, of his boarders. That wine had not been paid for, and it became nece&s;&s;ary for Lacombe, to draw both his wine and him&s;elf from the pro&s;ecutions of the widow. He contrived to &s;uppo&s;e a &s;ale of the wine, to a man by the name of Poireau, a writing ma&s;ter, and to declare that Poireau had paid for it beforehand; this wine was car|ried away, and Lacombe removed to another hou&s;e; in&s;omuch that the widow, who had a claim to make for the price of her wine, was, for a while, at a lo&s;s to know what had become both of her wine and Lacombe.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="028941_0009_0FDDB67556956328">
Luckily for her, Poireau pretended that the &s;ale agreed upon between Lacombe and him was &s;incere. Lacombe behaved him&s;elf violently to|wards Poireau; this was the motive which car|ried the two knaves before the municipal of|ficer; they were giving to one another the name of rogue, when they arrived before him; they were both put under arre&s;t, but as they were together in a room, the&s;e hone&s;t people ad|ju&s;ted their differences.</P>
<P>The municipal officer repealed the order of their arre&s;t; but, as he &s;u&s;pected that their re|concilement had been made at the expence of the widow, he cau&s;ed her to be informed of it; and &s;he &s;eized upon her wine in the dwelling hou&s;e of Poireau. This &s;eizing of the wine, gave place to a &s;uit before the ju&s;tice of St. Seurin, who compelled both Lacombe and Poireau to pay for the wine; thus the &s;hame of this rob|bery remained alone with the&s;e two men.</P>
<P>Lacombe has therefore given him&s;elf up to the exce&s;&s;es of the ba&s;e&s;t cupidity, as well &s;ince, as before the revolution.</P>
<P>Endowed with &s;ome talents, but rather a prattler than a thinker, Lacombe &s;eemed to
<PB N="12" REF="028941_0010_0FDDB677E921B578">
throw him&s;elf headlong in the revolution; he was, according to him&s;elf, the &s;courge of ari&s;to|cracy; he &s;ucceeded effectively in dazzling pa|triots.</P>
<P>He went to St. Foi, and opened a &s;chool there; but it is probable that neither his beha|viour nor his manners could obtain him the good will of the inhabitants; his undertaking proved abortive.</P>
<P>He has been bold enough to &s;ay that he had left St. Foi, on account of that place abounding with ari&s;tocrats and moderates. Citizens, this is a forgery which he has contrived to veil the true motives of his coming back to Bourdeaux. St. Foi, is cla&s;&s;ed among the towns which have con&s;tantly proved patriots; we have &s;een, and we even now behold, very worthy citizens from that community, tru&s;ted with public of|fices, and ju&s;tifying more and more by their equity, humanity and other republican virtues, the choice made of them by the repre&s;entatives of the people.</P>
<P>The ill fate of Bourdeaux, rai&s;ed up in its bo|&s;om &s;ome wicked men who, in concert with the intriguing deputies from the Gironde, abu&s;ed even the deluded patrioti&s;m of the citizens of
<PB N="13" REF="028941_0011_0FDDB67E11392E00">
this large city, in order to hurry them into li|berticide mea&s;ures. The&s;e traitors aimed at fe|derali&s;m, and they cloaked their plots under their oaths of the unity and indivi&s;ibility of the republic, and of their attachment to the Nati|onal Convention.</P>
<P>The National Convention, ju&s;tly irritated, propo&s;ed to employ no means, but the ju&s;tice which they are indebted for to the French peo|ple, as well as to their own dignity; the Nati|onal revenge threatened then a multitude of ci|tizens.</P>
<P>It was at that time that Lacombe left St. Foi, and rea&s;&s;umed his re&s;idence at Bourdeaux; as bold and apt to all that could forward his for|tune as he was, he joined with tho&s;e he had be|fore dazzled by his &s;peeches about his own vir|tues and patrioti&s;m. The citizens who&s;e te&s;ti|mony he might have dreaded, were &s;truck with &s;orrow and terror; they did no more &s;how them&s;elves. Lacombe profited by this in&s;tant of terror; he dreads no more the language of truth; he well knew how to imitate both the di&s;cour&s;es and manners of patrioti&s;m; they pro|claim him the mo&s;t inexorable enemy to ari&s;to|cracy and federali&s;m; his &s;upporters prai&s;e his talents and virtues; they are nearly &s;uppo&s;ing him to be endowed with the manners of a Spar|tan;
<PB N="14" REF="028941_0012_0FDDB67E256950F8">
both people and their repre&s;entatives are im|po&s;ed upon, he is tru&s;ted with the office of pre|&s;ident to the military commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Such a man was Lacombe from the epoch of the revolution, to the unlucky in&s;tant when by his intrigues he got in the &s;tation of pre&s;ident to the military commi&s;&s;ion; he was alternatively contemptible and impudent; he was never a patriot; is it po&s;&s;ible to be &s;o with a corrupted heart? He returned to Bourdeaux, only when he had a certainty to profit by the terror and &s;ilence of patriots, and to be at liberty of &s;peak|ing here about his virtues and patrioti&s;m, without the lea&s;t fear of being contradicted.</P>
<P>Let us now follow him into the di&s;charge of his duty, as pre&s;ident to the military commi&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is here that he entirely pulls off his ma&s;k; he appears fierce and humane &s;ucce&s;&s;ively: The rich counter revolutioni&s;t may be certain to &s;e|cure his life by giving up his pur&s;e to him; the guiltle&s;s, if he wi&s;hes to be di&s;charged, &s;hall be obliged to put his money by his innocence; the papers of the proce&s;s have exhibited to us the proofs of the&s;e odious bargains! It is thus that Lacombe, by pro&s;tituting the &s;acred duty of a
<PB N="15" REF="028941_0013_0FDDB683424EE1A0">
judge to his cupidity, ha&s;tened the &s;teps of the counter-revolution; by plundering together the counter-revolutioni&s;t, and the patriots, he &s;trengthened the tyrannical hopes of the former and reduced the latter to di&s;pair.</P>
<P>Let us fix our attention upon &s;ome of the facts, which are proved by the papers of the proce&s;s.</P>
<P>We have &s;een the relations of Journu-Au|bert, determined to do all in their power to &s;ave their relative who was out-lawed; they went &s;o far as to offer 300,000 livres: Bizat, for|merly a lawyer, was charged to make the &s;ame offer to Rey, a baker, the friend of Lacombe and the manager of the pecuniary propo&s;als made to him, and of the out-bidding of the di&s;|charge of his duty. Rey a&s;ked for a delay of two days after which he an&s;wered to Bizat that his offer had been accepted; a&s;&s;ignats to the a|mount of 205,000 livres were therefore deli|vered, and they depo&s;ited bills for the re&s;idue of 95,000 livres.</P>
<P>Mean while Journu-Aubert, who was igno|rant of the &s;teps made in his behalf by his rela|tions, having proved with the repre&s;entative of the people, both his innocence and patrioti&s;m, was re&s;tored to law. Such an event was calcu|lated to di&s;appoint our intriguers. The relati|ons
<PB N="16" REF="028941_0014_0FDDB684A7B9B938">
of Journu claimed again the 205,000 livres they had paid; it was impo&s;&s;ible to detain this money; the ju&s;tice ju&s;t done by the repre&s;enta|tive Y&s;abeau, to a well known patriot, &s;topped that of Lacombe; he felt therefore him&s;elf dri|ven to the nece&s;&s;ity of repairing the money; but he delayed more and more; he gave it back a|gain by little and little; and as if he had &s;up|po&s;ed that the relations of Journu ought to be grateful for his having been kind enough to ac|cept a &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and crowns, he has kept for him&s;elf a &s;um of about 70 or 75000 livres.</P>
<P>The very declaration of Bizat informs us that Bory, a brother-in-law of Journu, had agreed to give up 55,000 livres, as a reward for the pains which had been taken.</P>
<P>But remark the cunning of Lacombe and his a&s;&s;ociates; they ma&s;ked this &s;hameful extortion under the name of a fine, to which, &s;aid they, Journu could po&s;&s;ibly be condemned; as if a fine was to be depo&s;ited with the pre&s;ident of the tribunal, as if a fine was to be paid before|hand, as if Journu was to be condemned before being heard and before the reading of his ju&s;tification; as if the judges forming the tribunal together with Lacombe, ought not to perceive and judge but by his eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="028941_0015_0FDDB68A500B8B40">
Almo&s;t every day is marked out by &s;ome new prevarication.&mdash;He extorted 7200 livres from citizen Chappel.</P>
<P>He extorted 48,000 livres for his relea&s;ing ci|tizen Beaux.&mdash;32,000 livres from citizen Pe|rayre, viz.&mdash;20,000 livres before the arre&s;tation of his brother, by promi&s;ing that none of the two brothers &s;hould be arre&s;ted, and 12,000 livres after the one being arre&s;ted. Citizens, perfidy and a wanton outrage to the liberty of citizens, are found here by the mo&s;t impudent concu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He extorted 160,000 livres from citizen Le|changeur, and as the emi&s;&s;ary of Lechangeur, cried out upon &s;o exce&s;&s;ive an extortion, (for Lacombe would at fir&s;t have 200,000 livres,) Lacombe an&s;wered to him, <Q>who would&s;t thou have to pay, if monied people do not! I have got children, I mu&s;t &s;ecure them a fortune.</Q> Wicked man! did&s;t thou not perceive that the mo&s;t precious inheritance to be left to our chil|dren, is the remembrance of their father dying in a &s;tate of indigence; they then have, at lea&s;t, the certainty of their property being not &s;tain|ed by any crime.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="028941_0016_0FDDB68B74E588D0">
He extorted 58,000 livres from John Tartey|ron.</P>
<P>He had extorted 60,000 livres from citizen Ca&s;tarede, and 13,200 livres from the female citizen Dubergier. Lacombe, whom remor&s;e had not been able to attain, was afraid &s;ome days &s;ince to be di&s;covered; he cau&s;ed there|fore the &s;um of 13,200 livres to be returned to citizen Dubergier, as well as that of 60,000 li|vres to citizen Ca&s;tarede, &s;ome days previous to his being arre&s;ted.</P>
<P>The cupidity of Lacombe and his a&s;&s;ociates, acted upon trifling &s;ums, as well as upon con&s;i|derable ones. The wife of Bujac, having but an indifferent e&s;tate, gave 1200 livres with the hope of &s;aving her hu&s;band: And notwith&s;tand|ing that, Buzac was condemned to death.</P>
<P>The brothers Pimentel, gave &s;ome laces to the wife of Lacombe; &s;ome days after, Lacombe &s;uppo&s;ing to be in want of 6,000 livres, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to citizen Beraud, that he &s;hould bor|row for him this &s;um from the&s;e merchants. The money was accordingly borrowed by Be|raud; but Lacombe who, without doubt, wi&s;hed to appropriate the &s;um to him&s;elf without be|ing expo&s;ed to any pro&s;ecution on that account,
<PB N="19" REF="028941_0017_0FDDB690B615DEF8">
urged citizen Beraud to bind him&s;elf towards Pimentel; Beraud refu&s;ed and Lacombe did not receive the money.</P>
<P>Lacombe was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;iderable &s;ums; he would lodge that of 52,000 livres with citi|zen Perayre; on his refu&s;al, this &s;um was lodged with citizen Aequart.</P>
<P>Lebrun, a director to the National Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, was arre&s;ted; his friends offered to give 100,000 livres, but it was too late; Lebrun had now been brought before the military commi&s;|&s;ion. Lacombe fearing therefore to be &s;u&s;pec|ted, an&s;wered the offers by &s;aying that they had been delayed too long, and Rey added, that Le|brun would otherwi&s;e have been &s;aved; it is thus that the lives of citizens became, with Lacombe, an object of &s;peculation without troubling him&s;elf about di&s;tingui&s;hing republi|cans from ari&s;tocrats.</P>
<P>Citizens, I hurry this recital, un&s;ufferable for righteous men.</P>
<P>You have &s;een the female citizen Bujac, giv|ing 1200 livres as the price of &s;aving her hu&s;band, Bujac, who was condemned.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="028941_0018_0FDDB692289BDFC0">
Another deed of the &s;ame kind, but more important, another crime more deliberately atrocious has been perpetrated.</P>
<P>The wife of Dudon, as did that of Bujac, wi&s;hed to buy the life of her hu&s;band; &s;he gave one hundred louis' in &s;pecie: By receiving them Lacombe exclaimed again&s;t the &s;mallne&s;s of the &s;um, &s;aying that he wanted at lea&s;t one thou|&s;and louis'; Rey reported the&s;e words to the wife of Dudon, &s;he objected her impo&s;&s;ibility of procuring &s;o large a &s;um; her an&s;wer was re|lated by Rey to Lacombe, and this odious judge cried out, "&s;he will repent of it;" he then charged Rey, to tell the woman that &s;he mu&s;t find out this &s;um in three days; &s;he could not, Dudon was &s;entenced, and Lacombe kept up the one hundred louis' he had received. What a horrid pro&s;titution of his duty, of the life of men and of the laws!</P>
<P>But the mind is overwhelmed, at the recital of &s;uch horrors! do I want, citizens, to retrace here all the crimes which Lacombe has perpe|trated? Is it not enough of what I &s;aid, to rai&s;e up your indignation, and to arm you with the &s;word of the laws?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="028941_0019_0FDDB696F393D3B0">
He denied the&s;e facts at fir&s;t in the examina|tion he underwent; but as he found him&s;elf urged on account of the a&s;&s;ignats di&s;covered in &s;ome tin boxes, which he had hidden in the garret of his hou&s;e, he &s;aid that &s;ome ari&s;tocrats, the enemies which his faithful di&s;charge of his duty bad rai&s;ed up again&s;t him, had probably and wickedly brought the&s;e a&s;&s;ignats into his garret; &s;uch a ridiculous eva&s;ion would betray &s;ufficiently his crime, but his brother and Rey, who were his agents, have a&s;&s;erted that the a&s;|&s;ignats, this &s;hameful offspring of his extortions, had been brought into the garret but in com|pliance of his directions.</P>
<P>But he has afterwards confe&s;&s;ed &s;everal of his exactions; he declared that he had given to Du|ca&s;&s;e, another of his agents, a &s;um of 3,000 livres out of that he had received from the fe|male citizen Dubergier.</P>
<P>He has confe&s;&s;ed that Rey had delivered to him a &s;um of 6,000 livres out of the 48,000 livres exacted from citizen Beaux.</P>

But he made other avowals, which ju&s;tice ought to pre&s;erve carefully; he &s;aid in a letter to citizen Plenaud, that he had been mi&s;led by a de&s;ire to have his family rich; to which he ad|ded that he had denied every thing in his exa|mination on account of two very natural mo|tives; the one a de&s;ire to conceal his weakne&s;s, the other on account of the indignation he felt, at the odious and artful calumnies of the infa|mous Rey.</P>
<P>He had therefore denied every thing, and this avowal from his own, is a proof of the &s;in|cerity of Rey's declaration.</P>
<P>He &s;ays that he had denied every thing, in order to conceal his weakne&s;s; he therefore con|fe&s;&s;es to have perpetrated tho&s;e concu&s;&s;ions of which he is accu&s;ed: We differ, he and I, but about words; he calls weakne&s;s, what I call a horrid crime. A judge tru&s;ted with the mo&s;t rigorous duty, that of puni&s;hing the enemies of the republic, and, with the utmo&s;t impartiali|ty, of di&s;cerning them from its &s;incere friends, &s;uch a judge trading about ju&s;tice, is a mon&s;ter whom the world ought to get rid of! Such a judge is a declared enemy to the republic, for we now are in a &s;tate of revolution, and it is only by his fully executing the revolutionary
<PB N="23" REF="028941_0021_0FDDB69D3394C5E0">
laws and by his practi&s;ing the virtues which are the order of the day, that a judge can ma|nife&s;t him&s;elf a true friend to the revolution.</P>
<P>He denied the facts too, &s;aid he, becau&s;e he wi&s;hed to conceal the indignation he felt, at the odious and artful calumnies of the infamous Rey.</P>
<P>The infamous Rey! But, &s;ince Rey is an in|famous man, what epithet &s;hall we affix upon Lacombe? Is it not manife&s;t, that it is he who has employed Rey, as his agent?</P>
<P>Recall again, citizens, to your minds the odi|ous a&s;cendency he had a&s;&s;umed upon Rey. Some|times he threatened him with the guillotine, in ca&s;e he &s;hould dare to unveil his my&s;teries, add|ing that he had power enough to cau&s;e citi|zens to be impri&s;oned, without imparting it to the committee of &s;urveillance, to cau&s;e them to be &s;entenced, and to pull off the head of whom|&s;oever would be daring enough to in&s;pire him with any fears. When Rey communicated to him his apprehen&s;ion for their common fate, No, no, &s;aid Lacombe, no puni&s;hment will reach me in the &s;tation I am in; thou would&s;t certainly be expo&s;ed, if it were not for thy complying with what I pre&s;cribe to thee. Thou art the ma&s;ter
<PB N="24" REF="028941_0022_0FDDB69E318189C8">
of my &s;ecret, &s;aid he once to Rey, but I am the ma&s;ter of thy life.</P>
<P>Lacombe, however confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf guilty, but of weakne&s;s only; he likewi&s;e calls Rey an infamous man; we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e him to be very familiar with crimes, and his mind to be &s;trong|ly &s;ubjected to his heart, to a heart e&s;&s;ential|ly vicious, as well as to that egoti&s;m which com|pelled him to trample upon the mo&s;t &s;acred duty; which, before his eyes, gives to his crimes the phy&s;iognomy of weakne&s;s only, and that of crime to the conde&s;cen&s;ions, to which he was artful enough, to drive a man who has, at lea&s;t, the merit of &s;incerity.</P>
<P>Citizens, facts numerous enough, have con|vinced you, and the denials of Lacombe will not &s;hake your conviction; but he &s;hall be com|pelled him&s;elf to give up that crafty ju&s;tificati|on. He has been examined by the com|mittee of &s;urveillance; he has been confronted with Rey and Bizot, who had before given their evidences and declarations. Rey and Bi|zot have maintained to him, before the com|mittee, the truth of all the facts they had de|clared, and no one of tho&s;e who have witne&s;&s;ed tho&s;e debates, in which Lacombe unfolded the
<PB N="25" REF="028941_0023_0FDDB6A3AD6DDA30">
whole art of fal&s;ehood and hypocri&s;y, enter|tains no doubt of his being guilty.</P>
<P>What is the con&s;equence of the&s;e facts?</P>
<P>Lacombe, at the happy epoch of the revoluti|on, behaved him&s;elf, as did many others who&s;e element was corruption. Recall again, citizens, to your minds the theft, of about &s;ix or &s;even tuns of wine, and how he was reprimanded on that account by the municipal, who di&s;charged then the duty of policy. Lacombe had before vehemently talked about liberty! Virtue and a regeneration of manners; but he uttered a lan|guage, which was a &s;trange one to his heart; he pretended him&s;elf to be at the height of liberty, and he was in reality creeping in the mire of corruption.</P>
<P>That &s;pirit, with which he was in&s;pired did not fail him, when he was promoted to the of|fice of pre&s;ident to the military commi&s;&s;ion. Be|hold his crimes, they all partake of his propen|&s;ity to the mo&s;t infamous cupidity; it was that cupidity which, almo&s;t always, put his pa&s;&s;ions into movement, which prompted him into the mo&s;t odious bargains, which induced him to weigh in the &s;ame &s;cale with gold, the lives of
<PB N="26" REF="028941_0024_0FDDB6A4DA94B3E8">
citizens. It was that cupidity, which induced him to place in the &s;ame &s;cale the ari&s;tocrat and patriot, which pur&s;uaded him to &s;pare the ene|my of the revolution, provided he would pay the money exacted from him, and to keep fainting in the angui&s;h of terror the patriot, who has no money to give, or who would blu&s;h in giving it as a price for his innocence and patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>We are &s;en&s;ible that tho&s;e who have been &s;en|tenced to death, did, generally &s;peaking, merit it; either they were ari&s;tocrats, or they had a &s;hare in tyrannical mea&s;ures; but by entering into bargains with them, by his &s;triving to &s;ave them for money, he plainly partakes of the crime of counter-revolution, concealed in the hearts of &s;uch men; it mattered him but very little whether liberty &s;hould be de&s;troyed, pro|vided he could acquire riches.</P>
<P>But a thing which makes humanity tremble, is, to behold Lacombe, entering into contracts with the enemies to the revolution, &s;entencing them to death, and notwith&s;tanding keeping their money from them. What a &s;pecula|tion! What a horrid and cool-blood temper!</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="028941_0025_0FDD5EEEE1E932B8">
Let us ob&s;erve, citizens, that the revolution|ary circum&s;tances we are now under, want on behalf of every public officer, a revoluti|onary behaviour; let us particularly ob&s;erve that Lacombe was a pre&s;ident to a military commi&s;&s;ion, &s;pecially calculated to guide, and to ha&s;ten the &s;teps of the revolution. The crime of a prevaricator, ought, therefore, to be looked upon as a crime of counter-revo|lution; the public functioner who contrives means to &s;ave a counter-revolutioni&s;t &s;hould be looked upon as a counter-revolutioni&s;t him&s;elf, and mu&s;t undergo the puni&s;hment which the law directs again&s;t the declared ene|mies of the republic.</P>
<P>Citizens, the public opinion was &s;ome time &s;ince ri&s;ing again&s;t Lacombe; the repre&s;enta|tive of the people Y&s;abeau, was on the point to order his being arre&s;ted, when his powers were repealed by the committee of public &s;afe|ty.</P>
<P>Lacombe him&s;elf was affrighted, there is the motive for his, on one &s;ide, informing the re|pre&s;entative Y&s;abeau, that it would be impru|dent for him to &s;tay any longer at Bourdeaux, and, on the other &s;ide, for his delivering back,
<PB N="28" REF="028941_0026_0FDDB6AC1F106098">
to tho&s;e who had given them to him, the &s;ums and jewels he had received.</P>
<P>The repre&s;entative Garnier of Xaintes, was not long before he became acquainted with the di&s;po&s;ition of Lacombe, the report of his pre|varications reached him, and Lacombe was ar|re&s;ted.</P>
<P>Citizens, I &s;aw you trembling at the recital of &s;o many crimes; You have a&s;ked your&s;elves, how &s;uch a man could have been committed to di&s;charge the duty of a revolutionary ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It is to your misfortunes, to your errors, to that unlawful federali&s;m, to which Bourdeaux was driven, that you are indebted for &s;uch a &s;courge, the repre&s;entatives of the people &s;ent to re&s;tore this important city to the princi|ple of the unity and indivi&s;ibility of the re|public, could find any where, but men bran|ded with federali&s;m. Lacombe artfully pro|fited by this emergency. Generous people are tru&s;tful; the repre&s;entatives were impo&s;ed up|on and Lacombe was cho&s;en. The wicked and counter-revolutionary de&s;igns of Lacombe &s;uc|ceeded the righteous and benevolent de&s;igns of the repre&s;entatives. The terror with which he in&s;pired every one, unhappily con&s;trained
<PB N="29" REF="028941_0027_0FDDB6B098EAF7A0">
for a long time, the complaints of citizens. But truth has reached the repre&s;entatives of the peo|ple; ju&s;tice and humanity will be triumphant, both the republic and citizens, will be reveng|ed.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the proofs re&s;ulting from the papers of the proce&s;s, I demand that Jean Bapti&s;te Lacombe, lately a &s;chool-ma&s;ter and the pre&s;ident of the military commi&s;&s;ion e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in Bourdeaux; be condemned to death, and that in conformity to the law pa&s;&s;ed on the 27th of March 1793; that he in con&s;equence be given up to the executioner, and carried to the national &s;quare, in order to undergo the &s;aid puni&s;hment; I likewi&s;e demand, that his e&s;tate be declared forfeited to the benefit of the repub|lic, and that the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon him be printed, publi&s;hed and po&s;ted up every where it &s;hall be requi&s;ite.</P>

THE MILITARY COMMISSION, Convinced that Jean Bapti&s;te Lacombe, lately a &s;chool-ma&s;ter and the pre&s;ident to the former revolutionary commi&s;&s;ion, has been guilty of &s;undry exactions, concu&s;&s;ions, prevarications, as well as of the mo&s;t odious corruption of manners and the public mind, declares him to be a trai|tor to his country, and an enemy to the people; in con&s;equence of which it condemns him to the puni&s;hment of death, agreeably to the law, bearing date the 27th of March 1793, (old &s;tile) and from which the following is an extract:</P>
<P><Q>The National Convention, on the propo|&s;al of one of its members, declares its firm re|&s;olution to give no quarter, or peace to ari&s;|tocrats, or any other per&s;ons who are the enemies of the revolution, and it decrees that they are out-lawed.</Q></P>

<P><Q>There &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed in Bourdeaux, a new military commi&s;&s;ion, &s;pecially and &s;ingularly charged with trying the offences &s;aid to have been perpetrated by the late pre&s;ident of the tribunal, which exi&s;ted under the &s;ame deno|mination, as well as by his accomplices:</Q></P>
