<P>When you are upon <HI>Reading</HI> any <HI>Book,</HI> Let your <HI>Aims,</HI> for ever be of the &s;ame Importance.</P>
<P>To Strengthen my Advice, I will tran&s;cribe &s;ome Words of the Celebrated Lord Chief Ju&s;|tice <HI>Hale;</HI> who in his <HI>Account of the Good Steward,</HI> &s;ays, <Q>I carried along with me, in all my Studies, this <HI>Great De&s;ign,</HI> of improving them, and the Knowledge acquired by them, to the <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD's Name, and the greater Di&s;covery of His <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> and &s;o tran&s;la|ted my <HI>Secular Learning</HI> into an Improvement
<PB N="27" REF="002772_0026_0FE62E9FA2304608">of <HI>Divine Knowledge.</HI> And had I not practi&s;ed this De&s;ign in my Acqui&s;ts of <HI>Humane Learning,</HI> I had concluded my <HI>Time mi&s;pent;</HI> becau&s;e I ever thought it unworthy of a Man that had an <HI>Everla&s;ting Soul,</HI> to furni&s;h it only with &s;uch <HI>Learning,</HI> as would either <HI>Dye with his Body,</HI> and &s;o become un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;eful for his Everla&s;ting State, or that in the nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Moment after Death</HI> would be attained with|out Labour or Toll in this Life.</Q></P>
<P>Having thus fixed the RIGHT END of your Studies, Let the View of it make &s;uch an Impre&s;|&s;ion upon you, as to produce a Marvellous <HI>Indu&s;|try</HI> in your Pro&s;ecution of it: And Quicken you to ob&s;erve that Maxim, <HI>Do with thy Might, what thy Hand finds to do.</HI> Remember this; There ne|ver was an <HI>Eminent,</HI> who was not an <HI>Indu&s;trious</HI> Man.

<P>That you may not &s;uffer a Vile <HI>Impediment in your Studies,</HI> and <HI>Avocation</HI> from them, I do now particularly warn you again&s;t the &s;en&s;ele&s;s Folly of an Entanglement in any <HI>fooli&s;h Amour,</HI> while you are yet a Student at the College. 'Tis time enough, to think of <HI>Marriage,</HI> when your Con|dition in other Circum&s;tances as well as that of <HI>Age,</HI> will qualify you to make a <HI>Wi&s;e Choice,</HI> in a Point, which a very great <HI>Felicity,</HI> or a very great <HI>Calamity,</HI> for the re&s;t of your Days, will turn upon.</P>
<P>&sect;. 6. The <HI>Regulation of your Studies,</HI> is what I would now proceed unto. And for this, though
<PB N="28" REF="002772_0027_0FE62E9FA8D51448">the <HI>Regulae Studiorum,</HI> Written by <HI>Chytraeus,</HI> be a Book which I can heartily commend unto your Peru&s;al, yet, it being Written an Hundred and Twenty Years ago, I &s;hall not think the Per|u&s;al of <HI>That</HI> &s;ufficient for a Student in <HI>our</HI> Days. I mu&s;t further Accommodate you. And here, <HI>Humanity</HI> would complain of me, if I &s;hould for|bear to tell you, That the LATIN Tongue, which is more known and u&s;ed than any upon Earth, except the <HI>Arabic,</HI> is what you &s;hould for many Rea&s;ons labour to be Ready at; and Able not only to <HI>Write,</HI> but al&s;o to <HI>Speak</HI> in it, with <HI>Fluency</HI> as well as <HI>Purity;</HI> and confute the com|mon Ob&s;ervation, that tho' <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> do often <HI>Write</HI> [call <HI>Spencer</HI> and <HI>Burnet,</HI> for <HI>Two Witne&s;&s;es,</HI>] the be&s;t <HI>Latin</HI> in the World, yet they often <HI>Speak</HI> it but indifferently. For this Purpo&s;e you will do well frequently, both to employ your Pen, for compo&s;ing <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> or <HI>Epi&s;tles</HI> in it; and like|wi&s;e to maintain frequent <HI>Conferences</HI> in it, with &s;uch as under&s;tand the <HI>Phra&s;es</HI> and <HI>Beauties</HI> of it. Indeed, I know not a prettier Way, than this; Tran&s;late into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> the Paragraphs of &s;ome Au|thor who writes very good <HI>Latin</HI> [&s;ay, the <HI>Enchi|ridion Precum</HI> of a <HI>Boehm;</HI>] and then again, Laying a&s;ide your Author, turn your own <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> into <HI>La|tin;</HI> and &s;o compare <HI>That</HI> with, and correct it from, your Authors. But at the &s;ame time, you &s;hould familiarize your&s;elf with the <HI>Style</HI> of &s;ome Authors, who&s;e <HI>Latin</HI> cannot but ever Charm you with its Elegancies. On this Occa&s;ion, I am as far from inviting you into the Gu&s;t of <HI>Linacre,</HI> as great a Critic as mo&s;t we have had for the <HI>Latin Tongue,</HI> who, <HI>Ciceronis dictionem, nunquam probare po|tuit,
<PB N="29" REF="002772_0027_0FE62E9FA8D51448">nec &s;ine fa&s;tidio audire;</HI> As I am, from invit|ing you into the <HI>Ciceronian</HI> Bigotry of a <HI>Bembo,</HI> or, to be as afraid as <HI>Longolius</HI> was of u&s;ing the Word, <HI>Po&s;&s;ibile.</HI> But yet I will pre&s;ume upon &s;o much of <HI>Paradox,</HI> as to offer you my Opinion, (tho' I know what Cen&s;ure a <HI>Quintilian</HI> would pa&s;s upon me, for &s;aying) That the <HI>Latin</HI> of an <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> of a <HI>Calvin,</HI> or of a <HI>Wit&s;ius,</HI> is preferrible unto <HI>Ci|cero</HI>'s; yea, to make up the Me&s;s, I am content that poor <HI>Ca&s;tellio</HI> too be introduced.</P>
<P>From <HI>Rome</HI> you mu&s;t needs pa&s;s to <HI>Greece.</HI> And I cannot but wi&s;h you &s;o much a GRECIAN, as not only to under&s;tand your <HI>Greek Te&s;tament,</HI> better than they do ordinarily at this Day in <HI>Athens,</HI> in which, of all Places, it &s;eems they now &s;peak the <HI>wor&s;t Greek</HI> that is any where &s;poken; but al&s;o, that you may at lea&s;t be able to Read a <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> of the <HI>Savilian</HI> Edition; and not enjoy the <HI>Fathers</HI> only in the <HI>Latin Tran&s;lations,</HI> in which alone, the Roman Catholicks, (agreeably indeed unto the <HI>Name</HI> of their <HI>Church,</HI>) now generally chu&s;e to publi&s;h them and peru&s;e them. However, I can't encourage you, to throw away much Time, up|on an Accurate Skill in the <HI>Greek Accents:</HI> But rather wholly to drop them, when your Quill comes to convey any <HI>Greek</HI> into your Pages. For, as the Writing of <HI>Greek</HI> otherwi&s;e than in <HI>Capitals,</HI> was introduced in later Ages by the Monks of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who borrowed the &s;maller Letters now u&s;ed from the <HI>Copric;</HI> So, One &s;hall hardly find any <HI>Accents</HI> on the <HI>Greek,</HI> in any Manu&s;cripts written above Eight Ages ago: Nor was the Invention of the <HI>Accents,</HI> with which our <HI>Greek</HI> is now en|cumbred,
<PB N="30" REF="002772_0028_0FE62EA0AFD6E320">of any other than a <HI>Mu&s;ical</HI> Intention. And, <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> with <HI>Henninius</HI> after him, are not the only Gentlemen, who have declared earne&s;tly a|gain&s;t pronouncing the <HI>Greek</HI> according to the <HI>Accents:</HI> I pray, how would a Ver&s;e of <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ound, if it were &s;o pronounced?</P>
<P>But for the HEBREW, I am importunate with you. And the more &s;o, becau&s;e 'tis one Remark|able In&s;tance of the <HI>Depraved Gu&s;t,</HI> into which we are of later Years degenerated, that the Know|ledge of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is fallen under &s;o much Di&s;|repute, as to make a learned Man almo&s;t afraid of owning that he has any thing of it, le&s;t it &s;hould bring him under the Su&s;picion of being an Odd, Starv'd, Lank &s;ort of a thing, who had lived only on <HI>Hebrew Roots</HI> all his Days. What would an <HI>Amama,</HI> and the re&s;t of the brave Men, who &s;hone in the former Age, and had <HI>Souls like the Gates of a Temple,</HI> &s;ay, if they might Ri&s;e and &s;ee the <HI>Men of this Generation!</HI> 'Tis true, the Know|ledge of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is, contrary to the old Max|im, <HI>Difficilia quae Pulchra,</HI> with very little <HI>Difficul|ty</HI> attain'd unto. Even our little Dam&s;els, like <HI>Blae&s;illa,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Paula,</HI> (concerning the <HI>Mother</HI> of whom <HI>Jerom</HI> reports the &s;ame, that he does of the <HI>Daughter,</HI>) make nothing of coming at this Uncommon Ornament. And <HI>Cooper</HI> &s;ays, truly, that if Students would &s;pend as much Time at it in a Morning or an Evening as they mi&s;pend on an unprofitable Pipe of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> they would in a few Days be Ma&s;ters of it. It is al&s;o to be owned, that there appears nothing more impertinent, than a little <HI>Hebrician,</HI> Vapouring and Swaggering, as
<PB N="31" REF="002772_0028_0FE62EA0AFD6E320">if he had all the Learning in the World; and laying hold on all Occa&s;ions to throw out an <HI>He|brew</HI> Clau&s;e or Word, for nothing but the O&s;ten|tation of his <HI>mighty Accompli&s;hment.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, the Knowledge of the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> is to be valued and pur&s;ued, on this De&s;ign; 'Twill enable you to penetrate further into the <HI>deep Things</HI> which the <HI>Spirit of GOD</HI> has laid up in His Oracles, than you could po&s;&s;ibly do, by &s;eeing them only in &s;ome Tran&s;lation. Tho' with much more Cau&s;e than the mode&s;t <HI>Melancthon,</HI> I may confe&s;s <HI>Me vix primis Labiis degu&s;ta&s;&s;e Hebraicas Literas,</HI> yet as <HI>he</HI> declared, what <HI>Hebrew</HI> he had helped him &s;o much in his Judgment of the greate&s;t Matters, he <HI>prefer'd it before all the Wealth of a Kingdom,</HI> &s;o, <HI>I</HI> may hum|bly declare, I &s;carce ever take an <HI>Hebrew Bible</HI> into my Hands, but I am gratefully &s;urprized with &s;omething I never thought of; I ever have &s;ome <HI>new View,</HI> and &s;ee &s;omething I never &s;aw be|fore. So that I do not wonder at <HI>Luther</HI> for mak|ing a <HI>&s;erious Prote&s;tation,</HI> that what <HI>Knowledge</HI> he had of the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> was of more U&s;e and more Price to him, than the greate&s;t <HI>Heap of Gold</HI> that could be &s;et before him.</P>
<P>Indeed, I cannot but wi&s;h, that a Knowledge of the SYRIAC may come in, as an <HI>Appendix</HI> to your Knowledge of the <HI>Hebrew:</HI> Not meerly be|cau&s;e it was the <HI>Mother-Tongue</HI> unto the Writers of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> [which is the Rea&s;on that we have no Greek Word of the <HI>Dual Number</HI> in all the <HI>New Te&s;tament;</HI> For that Number is what the <HI>Syriac</HI> is a Stranger to:] But chiefly becau&s;e the mo&s;t Valuable and Serviceable Ver&s;ion that
<PB N="32" REF="002772_0029_0FE62EA0B54000F8">we have of the Divine Oracles, and what may be of mo&s;t Authority in many Important Points to clear up the Sen&s;e of them, is the <HI>Syriac.</HI> And having once got the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> you'l find the <HI>Syriac</HI> ea&s;ily come-at-able.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Living Tongues,</HI> 'tis a Matter of &s;ome Speculation, that almo&s;t all the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> in the World, &s;peak the <HI>Teutonic</HI> and what is derived from it; almo&s;t all the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> are found in the Derivations from the <HI>Latin;</HI> the <HI>Greek Church</HI> is mo&s;tly in the <HI>Sclavonic.</HI> If you intend any Ser|vice to the Kingdom of GOD abroad, you may here take your Choice. But if you have any Time in your <HI>Short Life</HI> to &s;pare for the <HI>Living Tongues,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> will be &s;ure in the fir&s;t Place to <HI>Court</HI> you. And, tho' the Complement which the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> have paid unto that Lan|guage, has look'd like a paving of the Way, (which doubtle&s;s, the <HI>French Academy</HI> have had in their Eye) for the <HI>extending</HI> of a Covetous and Ambiti|ous Monarchy, <HI>To what will never be accompli&s;hed;</HI> yet, for the &s;ake of your Admi&s;&s;ion to the Read|ing of many <HI>French Books</HI> that may be worth your Peru&s;al, I do not forbid your Learning of it. This, the rather, for that albeit the <HI>Engli&s;h Tongue</HI> is ca|pable of being made the mo&s;t Expre&s;&s;ive, and the mo&s;t Copious in the World, and is in the&s;e Re|gards much Superiour to the <HI>French;</HI> neverthe|le&s;s, it may be ob&s;erved, There is no Man who has the <HI>French Tongue,</HI> but ordinarily he &s;peaks the neater <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for it.</P>

<P>One Thing that I advi&s;e you to, is This. Keep your QUOTIDIANA. I mean Have your <HI>Blank Books,</HI> in which <HI>Note</HI> with your Pen, for the mo&s;t Part <HI>Every Day,</HI> [Let there be, <HI>Nulla Dies &s;ine Li|nea!</HI>] Some <HI>Notable Thing,</HI> which in Reading you have newly met withal.

Here you will anon have an inexhau&s;tible <HI>Magazine;</HI> and if you live to <HI>Old Age,</HI> you will find, that, like Old <HI>Photius,</HI> you have prepared an <HI>Hive</HI> then to live upon.

It co&s;t the <HI>Pru&s;&s;ians,</HI> the Trou|ble of a <HI>War,</HI> before they could oblige their Neigh|bours, to call them no longer <HI>Brutos,</HI> which they did before the Tenth Century, but, <HI>Pru&s;&s;es,</HI> which &s;ignifies, it &s;eems, <HI>A Prudent People.</HI> I wi&s;h it may co&s;t you no more Trouble, than only a little <HI>Rea|ding</HI> of, and <HI>Thinking</HI> on, certain <HI>Maxims of Pru|dence</HI> to render you one of that People.

<P N="1">I. The <HI>Italian</HI> Maxims are no <HI>Imprudent</HI> ones. One mu&s;t not <HI>Spend all he hath;</HI> nor <HI>Do all he can;</HI> nor <HI>Tell all he knows;</HI> nor <HI>Believe all he hears.</HI></P>

<P N="4">IV. I have heard one &s;ay, That there was a Gentleman in the <HI>Nineteenth Chapter</HI> of the <HI>Acts,</HI> to whom he was more endebted, than to any Man in the World.

<P N="5">V.
