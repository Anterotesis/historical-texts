<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the author of the following di&s;cour&s;e might avail him&s;elf of the common apology for publi&s;hing Sermons, viz. The importunity of friends; yet he &s;hould have been aver&s;e to this publication had it not been that the &s;ubject and occa&s;ion gave him opportunity to ca&s;t in his mite for the relief of the oppre&s;&s;ed and injured Afri|cans, who&s;e cau&s;e he thought him&s;elf bound to plead, and to bear his te&s;timony again&s;t the cruel and barbarous Slave Trade. He is &s;en&s;ible the arguments on that &s;ubject might be treated, more at large, and to better advantage; he de|&s;igned to treat the &s;ubject only in a moral and religious view, and he could only hint a few thoughts on <HI>that</HI> branch of the argument, in a &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e in which &s;everal other things were con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The author pretends not to pronounce on the impropriety of the Slave Trade in a political view&mdash;this would be out of his province: but he would &s;ubmit to the gentlemen of the law, whether the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;lavery in a government &s;o democratical as that of the colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> doth not tend to the &s;ubver&s;ion of its happy con&s;titution. Be this as it may, if the Slave Trade is contrary to the law of na|ture, which is the law of God, it is more than time it was effectually prohibited, and until that is done we, are account|able to God for all the &s;ufferings which we bring upon the unhappy Negroes; for whatever difficulties there may be in the way of freeing the &s;laves already among us (as there are confe&s;&s;edly &s;ome) the&s;e cannot be rea&s;onably advanced, again&s;t prohibiting the importation of more. Should it be ob|jected
<PB N="vi" REF="014100_0004_0F92DB43D1D56248">
that preaching and printing again&s;t the &s;lave trade will tend to encourage &s;ervants in di&s;obedience to their ma&s;|ters and &s;upport them in di&s;order and rebellion, the author need only reply, that though he is fully convinced that there is no more rea&s;on or ju&s;tice in our en&s;laving the Africans than there would be in their en&s;laving us, yet he thinks the Negro &s;laves among us are bound by motives of duty and in|tere&s;t to "be obedient to their own ma&s;ters," and to "&s;hew all good fidelity" in their &s;ervice, agreeable to apo&s;tolic di|rection, and as the mo&s;t probable method to make their yoke ea&s;y, and pave the way for obtaining their freedom, or, if not their own, that of their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>He would be &s;orry to be, even the innocent, occa&s;ion of di&s;orders in families, but &s;hould this be the ca&s;e it is no &s;uf|ficient objection again&s;t a&s;&s;erting the truth on this &s;ubject: there is, perhaps, &s;carce any doctrine of chri&s;tianity but what hath been made the occa&s;ion of &s;in, through the perver&s;ene&s;s of wicked men; e&s;pecially hath this been true of the doc|trines of grace&mdash;Mu&s;t the doctrines of grace therefore not be preached?</P>
<P>In fine, it is ardently wi&s;hed that the divine ble&s;&s;ing may attend the addre&s;s to the &s;laves of &s;in and &s;atan&mdash;that they may e&s;cape from their bondage, and be made partakers of the glorious liberty of the &s;ons of God.</P>

<P>While they promi&s;e them <HI>Liberty,</HI> they them&s;elves are the &s;ervants of corrup|tion; for of whom a man is overcome, of the &s;ame is he brought into <HI>Bondage.</HI></P></Q>

<P>_TO a&s;&s;ert and maintain the cau&s;e of Liberty, is far from being pe|culiar to the Briti&s;h colonies in North-America, at the pre&s;ent day; our venerable Ance&s;tors &s;ought and found it in this we&s;t|ern world, and at no &s;mall ex|pen&s;e of their trea&s;ure and blood, purcha&s;ed it for, and conveyed it down to us. The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ed and worthy characters in Great-Britain have pa|tronized, &s;poke and written, and &s;ome of them even died, in defence of the &s;acred rights of Liberty!
<PB N="8" REF="014100_0006_0F92DB4554697E90">
Tho&s;e antient, renowned States of Greece and Rome, in their mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition, received their greate&s;t lu&s;ture from a &s;et of pubilc &s;pirited, patriotic men, who&s;e hearts glowed with the love of liberty, who were her defenders and &s;upporters, and who&s;e names and writings are venerable to di&s;tant ages and nations of men, even long after tho&s;e once mighty empires are gone to decay, and peri&s;hed through neglecting to follow the maxims of tho&s;e wi&s;e men, tho&s;e patrons of liberty, who pointed out the path to la&s;ting empire and glory.</P>
<P>INDEED, the &s;acred cau&s;e of liberty ever hath been, and ever will be venerable in every part of the world where knowledge and learning flouri&s;h, and men are &s;uffered to think and &s;peak for them&s;elves. Yea, it mu&s;t be added, that Heaven hath appeared in the cau&s;e of liberty, and that in the mo&s;t open and deci&s;ive manner: For this, the Son of God was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, that he might de&s;troy the ty|ranny of &s;in and &s;atan, a&s;&s;ert and maintain the equal government of his Father, redeem the guilty &s;laves from their more than Egyptian bondage, and cau&s;e the oppre&s;&s;ed to go free.</P>
<P>THE whole plan of Redemption, which is by far the greate&s;t and mo&s;t noble of all the works of God made known to us, to which they all tend, and in which they centre, is compri&s;ed in procuring, preaching and be&s;towing liberty to the captives, and the opening of the pri&s;on to the bound: And the go&s;pel of our &s;alvation is principally taken up in de&s;cribing that glorious liberty which is purcha&s;ed for &s;inners by the Son of God&mdash;the bondage from which he redeem us&mdash;the ran&s;om which he paid
<PB N="9" REF="014100_0007_0F92DB460BD367A0">
for our redemption&mdash;the way to obtain and enjoy this Liberty, and in &s;tating and urging the mo&s;t co|gent and endearing arguments, and motives, to per|&s;uade us to come out of our bondage, and accept of the Liberty wherewith Chri&s;t maketh his people free. It is on this account denominated <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> or <HI>Good News;</HI> and is to the &s;inner, like the jubilee trumpet to the en&s;laved I&s;raelite.</P>
<P>BUT it mu&s;t be remembered, that in proportion as Liberty is excellent, and to be de&s;ired on the one hand, &s;o &s;lavery or bondage is terrible and to be a|voided on the other. The&s;e are ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the two extremes of happine&s;s and mi&s;ery in Socie|ty. It will not therefore be thought foreign to our &s;ubject, or an un&s;uitable attempt upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to enquire into the various &s;ig|nifications of the&s;e two oppo&s;ite terms, as they are u&s;ed in the &s;everal kinds of &s;ociety with which we are concerned, e&s;pecially as they are intro|duced in our text as oppo&s;ed to each other, and it is intimated, that the mo&s;t fond a&s;&s;ertors of liberty, may after all, be them&s;elves in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery and bondage.</P>
<P>LIBERTY may be defined in general, <HI>a power of action,</HI> or a certain &s;uitablene&s;s or prep aredne&s;s for exertion, and a freedom from force, or hindrance from any external cau&s;e; <HI>Liberty</HI> when predicated of man as a moral agent, and accountable creature, is that &s;uitablene&s;s or preparedne&s;s to be the &s;ubject of voli|tions, or exerci&s;es of will, with reference to moral objects; by the influence of motives, which we find belongeth to all men of common capacity, and who are come to the years of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014100_0008_0F92DB46C9E0FDE0">THIS Liberty is oppo&s;ed to that want of capacity, by which there is a total ignorance of all moral ob|jects, and &s;o, a natural incapacity of chu&s;ing with regard to them. <HI>Again,</HI> the term Liberty is fre|quently u&s;ed to denote a power of <HI>doing as we plea&s;e,</HI> or of executing our acts of choice; this refers prin|cipally to external action, or bodily motion; and is oppo&s;ed to force or oppo&s;ition:&mdash; thus the pri&s;oner who is bound in fetters, and &s;ecured with bolts and bars of a pri&s;on, is not at liberty to go out, he is deprived of this kind of liberty, and is in bond|age.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Liberty may be con&s;idered and defined with reference to &s;ociety:&mdash; Mankind in a &s;tate of nature, or con&s;idered as individuals, antecedent to the &s;uppo&s;ition of all &s;ocial connections, are not the &s;ubjects of <HI>this freedom,</HI> but it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the well being of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>HUMAN &s;ociety is founded originally in compact, or mutual agreement. All the larger circles of &s;o|ciety originate from family connection or mutual compact between hu&s;band and wife; and mutual compact nece&s;&s;arily implieth certain rules and obli|gations which neither of the parties may violate with impunity.</P>
<P>IN the early ages of the world, before vice and wickedne&s;s had corrupted and de&s;troyed the original natural form of civil government, as a fine writer of our own nation expre&s;&s;eth it;&mdash;"each patriarch &s;at king, prie&s;t and prophet of his growing &s;tate." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. POPE.</NOTE> But when the wickedne&s;s of man was become ex|ceeding
<PB N="11" REF="014100_0009_0F92DB4795DC7F20">
great, and every imagination of his heart evil, <HI>the earth was filled with violence:</HI> by the daring efforts of wicked men to &s;ubvert the original ex|cellent form of &s;ociety, and introduce de&s;potic rule where the lives and happine&s;s of many, even whole kingdoms &s;hould depend on the will, and be &s;ub|&s;ervient to the plea&s;ure of <HI>one man.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;is vi. 4, 5, and x. 8, 9.</NOTE> But as &s;ociety evidently originates from mutual compact or agree|ment, &s;o it is equally evident, that the members who compo&s;e it, unite in one common intere&s;t; each in|dividual gives up all private intere&s;t that is not con|&s;i&s;tent with the general good, the intere&s;t of the whole body: And, con&s;idered as a member of &s;ociety, he hath no other intere&s;t but that of the whole body, of which he is a member: The ca&s;e is &s;imilar to that of a trading company, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a common &s;tock, into which every one hath given his proportion; the intere&s;t of this common &s;tock is now the property of the whole body, and each individual is benefited in proportion to the good of the whole, and is a good or bad member in proportion as he uniteth to, or counteracteth the intere&s;t of the body. And thus it is in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e: civil &s;ociety is formed for the good of the whole body of which it is compo&s;ed. Hence the welfare and pro&s;perity of the &s;ociety is the <HI>common good,</HI> and every individual is to &s;eek and find his happine&s;s in the welfare of the whole, and every thing to be tran&s;acted in &s;ociety, is to be regulated by this &s;tandard.&mdash;In particular, all the laws and rules formed in &s;uch &s;ociety mu&s;t tend to promote the general welfare; this is the te&s;t by which they mu&s;t be tried, and by which they mu&s;t &s;tand or fall; all regulations in the body, and all rewards and pu|ni&s;hments
<PB N="12" REF="014100_0010_0F92DB491F9488A0">
to individuals, mu&s;t be determined agree|able to this.&mdash;Tho&s;e who &s;eek and promote the public intere&s;t, are to be e&s;teemed and rewarded; and tho&s;e who counteract and oppo&s;e it, mu&s;t be pu|ni&s;hed in proportion to the injury aimed or com|mitted again&s;t the public welfare.</P>
<P>WE may add, that as the good of the public is the end and de&s;ign of all good laws and rules, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in a well regulated &s;ociety, &s;o they mu&s;t be enacted by the public, <HI>i. e.</HI> by the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men in the &s;ociety, appointed by the body for this purpo&s;e.&mdash;Men who be&s;t under&s;tand the public good, and have a common intere&s;t with the body, and who are above the narrow pur&s;uits of pri|vate intere&s;t.&mdash;If Laws and rules in &s;ociety are e&s;tabli&s;hed by any man, or body of men, who have not a common intere&s;t with the whole bo|dy of the members, but the contrary, it is evi|dent at fir&s;t view, they will be expo&s;ed to act in oppo&s;ition to the general good.&mdash;None therefore but the repre&s;entatives of the whole body, in whom as far as po&s;&s;ible, the intere&s;t of all ranks is contain|ed, are proper to make laws for the regulation of &s;ociety. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, tho&s;e who are to ex|ecute the laws, &s;hould be appointed in &s;uch a man|ner, and by &s;uch authority, as in the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible way &s;ecures their attachment to the general good: And, the members of civil community who are di&s;|obedient to <HI>&s;uch laws</HI> and oppo&s;e the admini&s;tration of <HI>&s;uch authority</HI> agreeable to them, de&s;erve puni&s;h|ment according to the degree of their oppo&s;ition, and their opportunity to promote, or counteract the general good. The crime of every private mem|ber in oppo&s;ing the intere&s;t of &s;ociety, is greater
<PB N="13" REF="014100_0011_0F92DB49C9F3ED88">
than that of oppo&s;ition to the intere&s;t of an indivi|dual, as much (other things being equal) as the in|tere&s;t of the &s;ociety is greater and of more worth than that of an individual.</P>
<P>IN this view of our &s;ubject, we may form &s;ome conception of the crime of a civil ruler, who &s;acri|ficeth the public intere&s;t committed to his tru&s;t by &s;ociety, for the &s;ake of his own private gain;&mdash;who betrayeth that &s;acred depo&s;it, to gratify his nar|row, &s;ordid thir&s;t of wealth or honour:&mdash;We may form <HI>&s;ome conceptions</HI> of his crime, but we want words to paint the horrors of it.&mdash;If a private man is without excu&s;e, and is ju&s;tly doomed to die as a traitor and rebel, when he de&s;erts his country's cau&s;e, or ba&s;ely betrays it, though to &s;ave his life, what epithets of la&s;ting infamy are black enough to draw the picture of the inhuman paricide, who ba&s;ks in the glare of riches and grandeur, at the expence of the public welfare: Yea, may we not depend that heaven it&s;elf will a&s;&s;ert the cau&s;e of liberty, defend the injured innocent, and di&s;charge its thunderbolts on the guilty head of the oppre&s;&s;or, red with un|common wrath, to bla&s;t the man that owes his great|ne&s;s to his country's ruin?</P>
<P>FROM this general view of &s;ociety, we are led to ob&s;erve, that civil liberty doth not con&s;i&s;t in a free|dom from all law and government,&mdash;but in a free|dom from unju&s;t law and tyrannical government:&mdash;In freedom, to act for the general good, without in|curring the di&s;plea&s;ure of the ruler or cen&s;ure of the law:&mdash;And civil &s;lavery or bondage con&s;i&s;teth in being obliged either by a bad &s;et of laws, or bad and tyrannical rulers, to act in oppo&s;ition to the good
<PB N="14" REF="014100_0012_0F92DB4CE4DDD9D8">
of the whole, or &s;uffer puni&s;hment for our &s;teady at|tachment to the general good.</P>
<P>RELIGIOUS LIBERTY is the opportunity of profe&s;|&s;ing and practi&s;ing <HI>that religion</HI> which is agreeable to our judgment and con&s;ciences, without interruption or puni&s;hment from the civil magi&s;trate. And reli|gious bondage or &s;lavery, is when we may not do this without incurring the penalty of laws, and being expo&s;ed to &s;uffer in our per&s;ons or property.&mdash;</P>
<P>ECCLESIASTICAL LIBERTY, is &s;uch a &s;tate of order and regularity in chri&s;tian &s;ociety, as gives every member opportunity to fill up his place in acting for the general good of that great and holy &s;ociety to which the true church of Chri&s;t belongs, and of which they are a part. And <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;lavery,</HI> is &s;uch a &s;tate as &s;ubjects &s;ome branches of this &s;ociety to the will of others, (not to the good of the whole glori|ous kingdom) and puni&s;heth them with the lo&s;s of &s;ome, or all of the priviledges of eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;oci|ety, if they di&s;obey &s;uch tyrannical will, however they may act for the good of the whole, and &s;o, a|greeable to the law of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>FINALLY, there is another kind of liberty and bondage, which de&s;erve particular attention in this place, only as they are e&s;pecially pointed to in our text, but as being of principle concern to men, they may be denominated <HI>&s;piritual liberty and bondage.</HI>&mdash; This liberty is &s;poken of by our Lord, John viii. 32, 36. Ye &s;hall know the truth, and the truth &s;hall make you <HI>free,</HI>&mdash;if the Son make you <HI>free,</HI> ye &s;hall be <HI>free</HI> indeed. And, by the Apo&s;tle, Rom. vi, 18. Being then made <HI>free</HI> from &s;in, ye became the &s;er|vants of righteou&s;ne&s;s. Gallat. v. 1. &s;tand fa&s;t in
<PB N="15" REF="014100_0013_0F92DB4E4BAE5370">
the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made us <HI>free.</HI> 2. Cor. iii. 17. Where the &s;pirit of the Lord is, there is <HI>liberty.</HI></P>
<P>SPIRITUAL LIBERTY then, is freedom or readine&s;s and engagedne&s;s of &s;oul in the love and &s;ervice of God and Chri&s;t, and di&s;charge of the various branch|es of chri&s;tian duty.</P>
<P>SPIRITUAL BONDAGE, takes place in the dominion of &s;in and &s;atan in the &s;oul, or that &s;tate of alliena|tion from God and Chri&s;t, to which all impenitent &s;inners are &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THIS brief view of the various &s;ignifications of the terms <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> might be u&s;efully improv|ed in many inferences and remarks. I will detain you only with tho&s;e which follow.</P>
<P>INFERENCE fir&s;t.</P>
<P>IF civil liberty con&s;i&s;teth in acting freely, and without con&s;traint, or fear of puni&s;hment, for the public good, and tyranny and &s;lavery are the rever&s;e of this,&mdash;it followeth, that every one who acts for the general good of &s;ociety, is entitled to the appro|bation and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the body. None can ju&s;tly fall under the frowns of &s;ociety, but tho&s;e who pre|fer &s;ome private benefit to the public welfare: And every &s;ociety which &s;uffers, or even <HI>connives at</HI> the practice, in any of its members, of taking away the liberty or property of tho&s;e who have done nothing again&s;t the public intere&s;t, connives at inju&s;tice, and is &s;o far guilty of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="014100_0014_0F92DB4E87502970">OF all the enjoyments of the pre&s;ent life that of li|berty is the mo&s;t precious and valuable, and a &s;tate of &s;lavery the mo&s;t gloomy to a generous mind&mdash;to en&s;lave men, therefore, who have not forfeited their liberty, is a mo&s;t attrocious violation of one of the fir&s;t laws of nature, it is utterly incon&s;i&s;tant with the fun|damental principle and chief bond of union by which &s;ociety originally was, and all free &s;ocieties ever ought to be formed. I mean that of a general union for the common good, by which every individual is &s;ecure of public approbation &s;o long as he acts for the public welfare.</P>
<P>COULD it be thought then that &s;uch a palpable vio|lation of the law of nature, and of the fundamental principles of &s;ociety, would be practi&s;ed by individuals &amp; connived at, &amp; tolerated by the public in Briti&s;h A|merica! this land of liberty where the &s;pirit of freedom glows with &s;uch ardour.&mdash;Did not ob&s;tinate inconte&s;ti|ble facts compel me, I could never believe that Briti&s;h Americans would be guilty of &s;uch a crime&mdash;I mean that of <HI>the horrible &s;lave-trade,</HI> carried on by numbers and tolerated by authority in this country. It is not my de&s;ign to enter largely into the arguments on this &s;ubject; all who agree to the general principles alrea|dy laid down, will join in pronouncing the African &s;lave-trade <HI>a flagrant violation of the law of nature, of the natural rights of mankind.</HI> What have the unhap|py Africans committed again&s;t the inhabitants of the Briti&s;h colonies and i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies; to authorize <HI>us</HI> to &s;eize them, or bribe them to &s;eize one another, and tran&s;port them a thou&s;and leagues into a &s;trange land, and en&s;lave them for life? For life did I &s;ay? From generation to generation to the end of time! However the cruel bondage is &s;omewhat light|ened
<PB N="17" REF="014100_0015_0F92DB4F33C22EE0">
in the&s;e northern colonies, through the kindne&s;s and lenity of the ma&s;ters&mdash;kindne&s;s and lenity, I mean as far as the&s;e terms are applicable in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; I &s;ay, however the cruel bondage of the poor Africans is &s;omewhat lightened a|mong us; if we would for a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the na|ture of the &s;lave trade we mu&s;t be acquainted with the method of procuring the &s;laves&mdash;tran&s;porting them, and their treatment in the We&s;t-Indies, to which, and the &s;outhern colonies a great part of them are tran&s;ported, and where the nature of the &s;lave trade is <HI>con&s;i&s;tently</HI> di&s;played.</P>
<P>WHEN the Guinea traders arrive on that coa&s;t if the trading natives are not already &s;upplied with a proper number of &s;laves, they go into the back &s;ettle|ments and either by &s;ecret ambu&s;h, or open force, &s;eize a &s;ufficient number for their purpo&s;e; in accompli&s;h|ing which great numbers, many times are &s;lain, and whole towns laid in a&s;hes. When taken they are driven like cattle to the &s;laughter, to the &s;ea &s;hore, and &s;old to our Guinea traders, often for a &s;mall quantity of that &s;oul and body de&s;troying liquor, <HI>rum,</HI> qualified however with a large proportion of water, by which the ignorant natives are impo&s;ed upon, cheated, and di&s;appointed.&mdash;The poor &s;laves are bound and thru&s;t into the filthy holds of the &s;hips&mdash; men, women, fathers, daughters, mothers, &s;ons, with|out di&s;tinction; where they are obliged to <HI>rot together</HI> thro' a long &s;ea pa&s;&s;age, which happily releives num|bers from more intolerable &s;ufferings on the &s;hore.&mdash;</P>
<P>WHEN they are arrived at the We&s;t-Indies they are again <HI>expo&s;ed</HI> in the markets, and &s;old like bea&s;ts of burden to the inhuman planters, by who&s;e cruelty many more of them peri&s;h. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that out

of near an hundred thou&s;and which are computed to be tran&s;ported from Africa annually, almo&s;t one third peri&s;h on the pa&s;&s;age and in &s;ea&s;oning; and tho&s;e unhappy numbers who&s;e hard lot it is to be doomed to longer &s;lavery, wear out their wretched lives in mi&s;ery which wants a name. The Egyptian bondage was a &s;tate of liberty and ea&s;e compared with the con|dition of the&s;e unhappy &s;ufferers; and for a trifling offence their barbarous ma&s;ters will &s;eize and butcher them, with as little, and in many in&s;tances, perhaps le&s;s ceremony or regret than you would take away the life of one of your dome&s;tic animals. It would be an af|front to your under&s;tandings to enter on a long cour&s;e of rea&s;oning to prove the inju&s;tice and cruelty of &s;uch a trade as this. Let us for once put our&s;elves in the place of the unhappy Negroes. Suppo&s;e a number of &s;hips arrived from Africa at a neighbouring &s;ea port to purcha&s;e &s;laves, and tran&s;port them to that di&s;tant and to us inho&s;pitable climate and tho&s;e burning &s;ands&mdash;put the ca&s;e that a prevailing party in the neighbouring towns were &s;o lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of public welfare and to the feelings of humanity as to accept their bribes and join with them to effect the ruin of their fellow men. Let <HI>this</HI> be the devoted town&mdash;and even now while you are met to a&s;&s;ert and exerci&s;e that invaluable liberty which is the di&s;tingui&s;hed glo|ry of Engli&s;hmen, the honour and &s;afety of Connec|ticut; in this di&s;tined hour while your hearts glow with the love of liberty and exult in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; behold this hou&s;e &s;urrounded, whole armies from the neighbouring towns ru&s;h on you, tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t are at once overpowered by numbers and butchered, the &s;urvivors, hu&s;bands, wives, parents, children, breth|ren, &s;i&s;ters, the ardent lover and his darling fair one, all &s;eized, bound and driven away to the neighbouring

&s;ea-port, where all ranged on the &s;hore promi&s;cuou&s;ly, in a manner that pity and mode&s;ty relent to name: you are &s;old for a trifling &s;um, and &s;ee your inhuman purcha&s;ers rejoiceing in their &s;ucce&s;s. But the time is come for a la&s;t farewell, you are de&s;tined to differnt &s;hips bound to different and far di&s;tant coa&s;ts, go hu&s;bands and wives, give and receive the la&s;t em|brace; parents bid a la&s;ting adieu to your tender off|&s;pring. What can you &s;ay? What do to comfort or advi&s;e them? Their ca&s;e and yours admit not of con&s;olation&mdash;go, mothers, weep out your &s;orrows on the necks of your beloved daughters whom you have nur&s;ed with &s;o much care, and educated with &s;uch delicacy; now they mu&s;t go to a di&s;tant clime, to attend the nod of an imperious mi&s;tre&s;s, covered with rags and filth (if covered at all) they mu&s;t de&s;cend to the mo&s;t &s;ervile and intolerable drudgery, and every the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of unea&s;ine&s;s at their hard u&s;uage, meet the frowns and &s;uffer the mercile&s;s la&s;h of a cruel ma&s;ter.&mdash;But why ruminate on this; behold the inhu|man mon&s;ters tear you from your la&s;t embrace, bound in chains you are hurried to different ve&s;&s;els, croud|ed in their holds and tran&s;ported away forever from the &s;ight of all you love, to di&s;tant cruel lands, to live and die in &s;lavery and bondage, without the &s;mall|e&s;t hope of ever enjoying the &s;weets of liberty, or re|vi&s;iting your dear native country, with this only con|&s;olation, that your &s;ons and daughters are &s;uffering the &s;ame cruel bondage, and that from you a race of abject &s;laves will, probably, be propagated down for hundreds of years! <HI>Such are the &s;weets of this beloved &s;lave trade!</HI> It is the &s;ame to the unhappy &s;ufferers now, that it would be to us if it was our own ca&s;e; and the rea&s;ons again&s;t it are as &s;trong and powerful as they would be then&mdash;in &s;hort the man that can de|liberately

attend to this &s;ubject and not feel the emo|tions of pity, or indignation, or both, appears to be &s;unk quite below the feelings of humanity!

<P>WITH what a very ill grace can we plead for &s;lave|ry when <HI>we</HI> are the tyrants, when we are engaged in one united &s;truggle for the enjoyment of liberty; what incon&s;i&s;tence and &s;elf-contradiction is this! Who can count us the true friends of liberty as long as we deal in, or publicly connive at &s;lavery.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE general a&s;&s;embly of a neighbouring colony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rhode-I&s;land.</NOTE> have prohibited the importation of Negro &s;laves un|der a large penalty, and have enacted that &s;uch &s;laves &s;hall be free as &s;oon as they &s;et foot on the &s;hore within the colony. Can this Colony want motives from rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, religion, or public &s;pirit, to fol|low the example? When, O when &s;hall the happy day come, that Americans &s;hall be <HI>con&s;i&s;tently</HI> engaged in the cau&s;e of liberty, and a final end be put to the cruel &s;lavery of our fellow men? Then may we not expect that our liberties will be e&s;tabli&s;hed on a la&s;t|ing foundation and that Briti&s;h America and Engli&s;h liberty will flouri&s;h to the late&s;t po&s;terity!</P>
<P>INFERENCE 2. IF civil liberty con&s;i&s;teth in acting freely and without con&s;traint or fear of puni&s;hment for the public good, and &s;o, agreeable to the laws framed to promote and &s;ecure it, and civil bondage or &s;lavery is the rever&s;e of this.

<P>MEN who know the worth of public liberty, and are able and willing defenders of it, be the con|&s;equences what they may to their private intere&s;t, are the only proper per&s;ons to be rulers or repre&s;entatives of this free and happy colony. In &s;uch the votes of the freemen &s;hould unite, without the lea&s;t regard to party, intere&s;t, or any private views, agreeable to the nature and &s;olemnity of their oath, and as they value their ine&s;timable liberties, and would dread to fall a helple&s;s prey to tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>INFERENCE 3.

<P>IT is a ju&s;t way of rea&s;oning in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, from the le&s;s to the greater, let me &s;ay then, with what a&s;toni&s;hment and abhorrence &s;hould we look on a per&s;on who chu&s;es &s;lavery and bondage under the mo&s;t cruel tyrant, with the certain pro&s;pect of a &s;hameful, painful death, by the hand of the executi|oner, rather than all the &s;weets of Engli&s;h liberty!</P>

&s;atan, to the glorious, perfect liberty of the children of God! Yet how many make this fatal choice! How many too, who are at great expence and trouble in the cau&s;e of civil liberty and zealous a&s;&s;ertors of it! What &s;elf-contradiction and incon&s;i&s;tence is here! Is not this to &s;train out a gnat and &s;wallow a cammel? What is Engli&s;h liberty? What is American free|dom? When compared with the glorious liberty of the &s;ons of God? And what is &s;lavery under the gauling yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion, to the hard bondage of &s;in and &s;atan!
