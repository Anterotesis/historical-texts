<P>Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are of God: becau&s;e many fal&s;e Prophets are gone out into the World.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Words before us contain two Things, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A <HI>&s;olemn Caution</HI> from the holy Apo&s;tle to all Chri&s;tians, <HI>not to be|lieve every, Spirit, but to try the Spirits, whether they are of God.</HI> That is, not pre&s;ently to believe every Pretender to divine Re|velations to be under the Conduct of the Spirit of
<PB N="2" REF="003975_0004_10034E0B01C8C1B0">Truth, becau&s;e he him&s;elf had Confidence enough to affirm it: but to examine fir&s;t what Right &s;uch Per&s;ons could make out to &s;uch Pretences; and not to receive the Dictates of any Man as divine Ora|cles, whatever &s;pecious Pretences he might make, without &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to believe him <HI>a Teacher &s;ent from God.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. We have a very <HI>good Rea&s;on for the Caution</HI> given, <HI>viz. Becau&s;e many fal&s;e Prophets were gone out into the World:</HI> becau&s;e many who &s;et them&s;elves up for Teachers, and delivered the <HI>Devices of their own Hearts,</HI> or the <HI>Sugge&s;tions of the wicked one,</HI> yet pretended that they &s;pake only <HI>as they were moved by the holy Gho&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>From the Words we may ob&s;erve,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>That during the Lives of the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves there were many fal&s;e Pretenders to divine Revelation.</HI> Many fal&s;e Prophets are gone out into the World; <HI>deceitful Workers, transforming them&s;elves into the Apo|&s;tles of Chri&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 11.13.</NOTE>. This was indeed a notable In&s;tance of the <HI>&s;trong Delu&s;ion</HI> to which Mankind is liable; or el&s;e of the Corruption and <HI>de&s;perate Wickedne&s;s of the Heart of Man:</HI> that any &s;hould dare to ven|ture upon &s;o vile an Enterprize, while the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves were living, who had the Gift of <HI>di&s;|cerning Spirits;</HI> who had <HI>Authority</HI> eno' with all <HI>true Chri&s;tians</HI> to expo&s;e &s;uch Impo&s;tors; and who had &s;o much <HI>Power with God,</HI> as &s;ometimes to inflict Di&s;ea&s;es, and even Death it&s;elf, <HI>on the Children of the Divel.</HI> But yet it was <HI>no marvel</HI> (as the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 11.14, 15.</NOTE>) <HI>for Satan him&s;elt is transformed into an Angel of Light. Therefore it is no great Thing if his Mini&s;ters al&s;o be transformed as the Mini&s;ters of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="3" REF="003975_0005_10034E10A2FE38B0">who&s;e End &s;hall be according to their Works.</HI> It would be be&s;ide my pre&s;ent De&s;ign, to enquire who the&s;e fal&s;e Prophets were; or what fal&s;e Doc|trines or pernicious Practices they introduced. 'Tis enough that my Text expre&s;ly tells us, there were &s;uch; and that the Number of them was not &s;mall.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 We may ob&s;erve, <HI>that there were &s;ufficient Means for the People of God to know that the&s;e fal&s;e Preten|ders to divine Revelations were not of God.</HI> For it would not have been a &s;erious, whol&s;ome Charge, but a cruel Mockery in the Apo&s;tle, to bid them <HI>try the Spirits, whether they were of God</HI> or not; if there had been no &s;ufficient Means or Rules for them to <HI>di&s;cern the Spirit of Truth from the Spirit of Error</HI> by. The Apo&s;tle gives them a Rule in the follow|ing Ver&s;e, peculiarly &s;uited to di&s;cover the fal&s;e Prophets of his own Time: and there is enough in the holy Scriptures, to enable us to detect &s;uch Impo&s;tors in all Ages; whatever <HI>&s;trong Delu&s;ions</HI> they may be under them&s;elves, or whatever <HI>De|ceivablene&s;s of &V;nrighteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> they may think to con|ceal them&s;elves under from others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. We may ob&s;erve, <HI>That it was a Thing of dange|rous Con&s;equence, even for tho&s;e who believed the divine Authority of the Doctrines taught by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, to think other Teachers al&s;o to be of God, who were not &s;o.</HI> I &s;hall have occa&s;ion in the Progre&s;s of this Di&s;cour&s;e, to give &s;ome In&s;tances of the dan|gerous Con&s;equences of &s;uch a Mi&s;take; and there|fore I &s;hall forbear mentioning any at pre&s;ent. It will &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify the making &s;uch an Ob&s;erva|tion from the Text, only to &s;ay, that the Apo&s;tle wrote this Epi&s;tle to &s;uch as would never have be|come Chri&s;tians, if they had not thought the Doc|trines taught by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles to be
<PB N="4" REF="003975_0006_10034E1467416870">of divine Authority; and yet, that the Apo&s;tle ap|prehends them to be in danger from fal&s;e Pretenders to divine Revelation: otherwi&s;e the Warning in my Text would have been needle&s;s, the Apo&s;tle's Rule of Tryal in the following ver&s;e of no Signi&s;i|cancy, and the People of God di&s;quieted and alarmed for nothing. And therefore we way ob&s;erve,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>That it is the Duty and Intere&s;t even of tho&s;e who believe the divine Authority of the Doctrines taught by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, to examine the Claims of any other Pretenders to divine Revelation; and not to yeild to their Authority, unle&s;s there appears good Rea|&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e it divine.</HI> That it is their <HI>Duty</HI> is evi|dent from the expre&s;s Charge of the Apo&s;tle, to <HI>try the Spirits whether they were of God.</HI> And, that it is their <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> is no le&s;s evident from the dangerous Con&s;equences of the neglect of it; which mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to render &s;uch a Charge nece&s;&s;ary.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And now to apply the&s;e Ob&s;ervations to our pre|&s;ent Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>If there were many fal&s;e Pretenders to divine Re|velations even <HI>in the Apo&s;tles days,</HI> it will be no Mar|vel at all, if there be &s;uch <HI>in ours:</HI> but we may well expect it now, when there is no body qualified like the Apo&s;tles to expo&s;e and explode &s;uch vain or im|pious Pretences.</P>
<P>And if it was the <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> of Chri&s;tians <HI>then,</HI> while the extraordinary Gifts of the holy Spi|rit were very frequent, not to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the Authority of any Pretender to divine Revelati|ons, before they had tried and examin'd, whether he <HI>were of God</HI> or no; it mu&s;t much more concern <HI>us,</HI> to take heed to our &s;elves, and be &s;u&s;picious of all Pretenders <HI>now,</HI> when the extraordinary Gifts of the holy Spirit are generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have ceas'd.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003975_0007_10034E1E75D36F28">
And if <HI>while the Canon of Scripture was yet imper|fect,</HI> the People of God did not want &s;ufficient <HI>Means</HI> and <HI>Rules</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>Spirit of Truth</HI> and the <HI>Spirit of Error;</HI> we may very well &s;up|po&s;e our &s;elves <HI>thoroughly furni&s;hed unto this Work now.</HI></P>
<P>Since then we have Rea&s;on enough to expect Pre|tenders to divine Revelation and Authority in our days. I &s;hall enquire,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Whether there really are any &s;uch?</HI> And if there be; &s;ince we are &s;o much concerned and have &s;uch good Encouragement to endeavour to <HI>try the Spirits,</HI> I &s;hall examine,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Whether they are of God or no?</HI> Here then,</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to enquire, <HI>Whether there are any Preten|ders to divine Authority and Revelation in our Days!</HI> Now under this Inquiry I &s;hall have nothing to do with &s;uch as teach any Religions manife&s;tly contra|ry to the Religion taught us in the Scriptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament. For &s;ince I have long ago proved them to have been given by In&s;pi|ration of God; and &s;ince the God of Truth cannot deny or contradict him&s;elf; it is very plain that no Religion can be of God, which is evidently contrary to <HI>that</HI> taught us in the Scriptures. And therefore I have nothing to do under this Que&s;tion, with the Religions of the <HI>Mahometans</HI> or <HI>Heathen.</HI> Or if I had, they have both been formerly con&s;idered and di&s;charged.</P>
<P>Again, &s;ince I have long ago proved the In&s;pira|tion of the Scriptures of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> as well as of the <HI>Old;</HI> I have nothing to do with the <HI>Jews</HI> neither, whom we don't charge with fal&s;e Pretences to divine Revelation, but only with a fal&s;e Con|&s;truction of the True Oracles of God.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003975_0008_10034E20135CF860">
All that I have to do therefore under this Head, is only to enquire, <HI>Whether among tho&s;e that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, and admit that the Scriptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament were given by In&s;piration of God, there are any that pretend to divine Revelations them&s;elves; or that &s;et up any thing el&s;e as of equal Authority with the Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>And here the An&s;wer is obvious, <HI>That among tho&s;e Chri&s;tians that call them&s;elves Prote&s;tants there is a cer|tain Sect</HI> (and perhaps &s;ome particular Per&s;ons who do not denominate them&s;elves from any Sect) <HI>that pretend to divine Revelations:</HI> And <HI>that the Romani&s;ts generally arrogate a Spirit of Infallibility to their own Church; and pretend to have pre&s;erved &s;undry Traditions of the &s;ame Original and Authority with the holy Scrip|tures.</HI> Now &s;ince the&s;e Preten&s;ions are not only known and acknowledged, but earne&s;tly contended for, by the Parties or Per&s;ons charged with them, there is no need of in&s;i&s;ting here.</P>
<P N="2">II. It only remains, that according to the Caution given in my Text, <HI>we belive not the&s;e Spirits till we have tried whether they are of God;</HI> which was a &s;e|cond Thing propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But an Examination of them all would lead me into a larger Field than I purpo&s;e to enter at this Time.</P>
<P>My only Bu&s;ine&s;s will be with <HI>tho&s;e Sects or Per|&s;ons, who come under the General but</HI> (as it is common|ly now u&s;ed) <HI>mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ivocal and Indefinite Name of Prote&s;tants, who maintain that God is plea&s;ed, in our days, to di&s;cover religious Truths and Duties to His Children by immediate Revelations.</HI> In oppo&s;ition to which I &s;hall endeavour Two things, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>To &s;how that it is exceeding unlikely that God &s;hould do &s;o:</HI> And</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="7" REF="003975_0009_10034E2EA9816D60">
2. <HI>To try the Spirits of the&s;e modern Pretenders to divine Revelations, by &s;uch Rules as the Word of God &s;ugge&s;ts to us.</HI> By which, I think, it will appear, that they mu&s;t be numbred with the Prophets again&s;t whom we are cautioned in my Text.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. I am to &s;how, <HI>That it is exceeding unlikely, that God &s;hould di&s;cover Religious Truths and Duties to any of his Children in our days by immediate Revelation:</HI> And that becau&s;e it is <HI>altogether needle&s;s, and would be of no u&s;e,</HI> but <HI>very dangerous</HI> if he &s;hould.</P>
<P>I am not going here to di&s;pute, whether God is ever plea&s;ed in the&s;e days upon &s;pecial occa&s;ions, to impre&s;s the Spirits of any of his Servants with &s;trong Apprehen&s;ions of &s;ome Events, which it may be of great Importance to them&s;elves or others, to have &s;ome previous Intimations of; but only whe|ther he is plea&s;ed to di&s;cover religious Truths and Duties to any of them by immediate Revelation: which I &s;uppo&s;e he is not.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Becau&s;e it is altogether needle&s;s that he &s;hould.</HI> For a Di&s;covery of religious Truths and Duties by immediate Revelation mu&s;t be either the <HI>&s;ame</HI> with the Di&s;covery contained in the holy Scriptures, or <HI>another,</HI> But <HI>another</HI> Di&s;covery of religious Truths and Duties, than that contained in the holy Scrip|tures, cannot be by divine Revelation; unle&s;s God could contradict him&s;elf. For I have formerly proved, that the Sciptures of the New Te&s;tament give us a full and faithful Account of the Truths and Duties taught by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles. Now the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;olemnly <HI>cur&s;es him</HI> that &s;hould pre&s;ume <HI>to preach any other Go&s;pel than that of Chri&s;t,</HI> even tho' he were <HI>an Angel from Heaven.</HI> Gal. 1.7, 8. From whence it plainly follows, that if a Di&s;co|very of religious Truths and Duties &s;hould now be made to any Man by immediate divine Revelation,
<PB N="8" REF="003975_0010_10034E31B8B5A3A0">it mu&s;t be the <HI>&s;ome,</HI> at lea&s;t in Sub&s;tance with the Di&s;covery already contained in the Scriptures. And then what Nece&s;&s;ity can there be of it? For why may not all the Ends of divine Revelation be an|&s;wered by a Di&s;covery of the Nature and Will of God committed to Writing, and &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted to be of divine Original; as well as by a new im|mediate Revelation? It would be very unrea&s;ona|ble to pretend, that a Man cannot under&s;tand Truth and Duty by an external written Revelation, if it be but <HI>full</HI> and <HI>clear</HI> enough, as thoroughly as by an inward immediate one. Now that the Revelation contained in the Scriptures is &s;o <HI>full</HI> as to teach every thing which God requires us to <HI>believe</HI> or to <HI>do,</HI> in order to obtain eternal Life; and &s;o <HI>clear</HI> that, if we would but take the &s;ame prudent Me|thods that are nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand almo&s;t any other Book or Matter of Importance, we need not be at any Lo&s;s about it; is manife&s;t from what the Apo&s;tle tells us, 2 Tim. 3 15, 17. that <HI>the holy Scriptures are able to make us wi&s;e unto Salvation, thro' Faith which is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> and that <HI>the Man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed to all good works</HI> by them. So that there can be no Pretence of a Nece&s;&s;ity of new immediate Revelations to give Men a better Under&s;tanding of the important Truths and Duties of our holy Religion.</P>
<P>Nay, in this Re&s;pect a <HI>&s;tanding written Revelation</HI> hath the Advantage of <HI>an inward immediate one,</HI> which is but a <HI>tran&s;ient thing;</HI> and &s;o both the <HI>Mat|ter</HI> and the <HI>true Import</HI> of it may in a great mea&s;ure wear out of Memory by length of Time: Whereas in&s;pired Writings are &s;tanding Monuments of the Will of God, to which we may have Recour&s;e upon every Doubt or Failure of Memory; and we are
<PB N="9" REF="003975_0011_10034E3345A242C0">furni&s;hed with abundant Helps to under&s;tand the true De&s;ign and Import of them, of which we mu&s;t be de&s;titute in Ca&s;e of any Ob&s;curity in a tran&s;ient Revelation. Now if a Man may be more certain to have an abiding thorough Knowledge of his Du|ty from a &s;tanding written Revelation, than from an immediate tran&s;ient one, then it appears in a &s;tronger Light &s;till, that there can be no Pretence of need of immediate Revelations to fill us with the Knowledge of our Duty; &s;ince we are much better provided for already in that Regard, by a perfect &s;tanding Revelation of the Will of God conveyed to us in the holy Scriptures.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> But perhaps it will be objected here, That the Scriptures &s;peak much of the natural Darkne&s;s and Blindne&s;s of our Minds, and of their Inability to di&s;cern the Things of the Spirit of God, until God who commanded the Light to &s;hine out of Darkne&s;s, &s;hine into our Hearts to give the Light of the Knowledge of them. And what can this in|tend le&s;s than a Nece&s;&s;ity of immediate Revelati. ons?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> To which I an&s;wer; That tho' it be a great Truth, that the Under&s;tanding of Man in his natural State is &s;o much blinded, that without the gracious Influences of God's Holy Spirit it will never apprehend divine Truths, in &s;uch a manner as that the Heart &s;hall be &s;uitably affected and the Life go|verned by the Apprehen&s;ion of them; yet <HI>that</HI> im|mediate Operation of God upon Man, which is now nece&s;&s;ary to remove the natural Blindne&s;s of his Under &s;tanding, and make him capable of di&s;cerning divine Truths aright, is not an immediate Revela|tion of divine Truths to his Under&s;tanding; but only a gracious Removal of tho&s;e Impediments
<PB N="10" REF="003975_0012_10034E3A30A02A78">which would not have &s;uffered his Under&s;tanding to perceive tho&s;e Truths in a &s;piritual manner, whatever way they might be revealed to him in, whether mediately by the written Word of God, or immediately by inward Revelation. So that this operation of the Spirit of God upon Man, which is now nece&s;&s;ary in order to a right under&s;tanding of divine Truths, does not at all affect <HI>the manner</HI> of the Revelation of tho&s;e Truths; but it only affects <HI>the Faculty</HI> wherewith alone we can apprehend them, after what manner &s;oever they are revealed. And therefore no Plea for the Nece&s;&s;ity of immediate Revelations can be founded upon the Illuminations of the Spirit of God, &s;o often &s;poken of in the Scrip|tures.</P>
<P>Again, as an immediate Revelation of religious Truths and Duties is not at all nece&s;&s;ary to give any Man a competent Under&s;tanding of them; &s;ince this End is much better provided for by the &s;tand|ing Revelation contained in the Holy Scriptures; &s;o <HI>neither is it nece&s;&s;ary, to a&s;&s;ure Men that &s;uch Truths and Duties are of divine Original.</HI> For this al&s;o they have better A&s;&s;urance of from the Scriptures, than they could well be &s;uppo&s;ed to have from immedi|ate Revelation.</P>
<P>Our Lord him&s;elf prefers the Te&s;timony of the Scriptures before the Te&s;timony of <HI>one ri&s;ing from the dead</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 16.31.</NOTE>. And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> tho't the Te&s;|timony of the Scriptures a <HI>more &s;ure Word of Prophe|cy</HI> than what was delivered by a <HI>voice from Hea|ven</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 1.19.</NOTE>. And the Matter is too plain almo&s;t to admit of any Di&s;pute, with re&s;pect to the Scriptures of <HI>the New Te&s;tament</HI> in particular (to &s;ay nothing here
<PB N="11" REF="003975_0013_10034E40C2640B98">of tho&s;e of <HI>the Old</HI>) that the Witne&s;s God was plea&s;|ed to bear to the Religious Truths and Duties con|tained in them, by Signs and Wonders, Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t (not once or twice, but for a whole Age together) is a much more rational and &s;atisfactory Evidence of the divine Authority of them, than an immediate tran&s;ient Revelation of the &s;ame Truths and Duties to any particular Per|&s;on, without &s;uch Signs following to &s;upport the Credit of it, well can be.</P>
<P>Now if neither &s;o di&s;tinct a Knowledge of religi|ous Truths and Duties, nor &s;o good A&s;&s;urance of their divine Original, can rea&s;onably be expected by immediate Revelations, as we have already by the holy Scriptures; I think it will not be ea&s;y to con|ceive, what Need there can now be of any &s;uch Re|velations. For the great Ends of a Revelation are, to give us a &s;ufficient Knowledge of what we are to believe and practi&s;e, and &s;ufficient Evidence that it is God who requires the&s;e things at our hands: both which are done already, in the be&s;t manner that can be, by the holy Scriptures.</P>
<P>But perhaps it will be thought, That tho' there be no <HI>ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> that religious Truths and Duties &s;hould now be made known to any Man by immediate Revelation, yet it might be <HI>of very good U&s;e,</HI> if they &s;hould; e&s;pecially to &s;uch as are to be <HI>In&s;tructors of others:</HI> That a &s;en&s;e of the immediate Operation of the Spirit of God upon their Souls, in revealing divine Things unto them, would very much affect their Hearts, and &s;o fire them with a greater Zeal and Activity in their Ma&s;ter's Service. Which brings me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That &s;uch immediate Revelations would be no more u&s;eful than they are nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> Indeed there is no
<PB N="12" REF="003975_0014_10034E4986F5FF68">doubt to be made, but that they would warm the Heart and rai&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions for a Sea&s;on: but there is little Rae&s;on to think, that the Heat would prove la&s;ting; and none at all to imagine, that it would make an habitual Change in the Will and Affecti|ons. For God's pre&s;enting Truths to the Under|&s;tanding by immediate Revelation, and his bowing the Will and Affection to a Compliance with Duty, are Two as different Actions as can be; and have no nece&s;&s;ary Connection at all with each other.</P>
<P>Accordingly we find, that many who have at times had immediate Revelations, have yet lived and died very wicked Men. Thus <HI>Balaam</HI> who had often <HI>heard the words of God, and &s;een the Vi&s;ions of the Almighty</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. 24.4.</NOTE> yet &s;till continued to <HI>love the ways of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> as well as ever, even after that <HI>the dumb A&s;s &s;peaking with Man's Voice, had forbidden the Madne&s;s of the Prophet</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 2.15, 16.</NOTE> And &s;o our Saviour him&s;elf tells us in Effect, that <HI>many that have ca&s;t out Devils, done many wonderful Works, and prophe&s;ied in his name,</HI> &s;hall neverthele&s;s <HI>depart from him</HI> in the day of Judgment with the <HI>Workers of Iniquity</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Math. 7.22.23.</NOTE></P>
<P>In &s;hort, God hath given us &s;ufficient and abun|dant Evidence of the divine Authority of the holy Scriptures; and in &s;ome re&s;pects better than any Man can well be &s;uppo&s;ed to have of the Divinity of a tran&s;ient Revelation. And therefore as for them who will not hear or regard <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, we are far from having any Rea&s;on to think, that they would be effectually per&s;uaded or wrought upon by an im|mediate Revelation: And &s;o &s;uch immediate Reve|lation would only &s;erve to rai&s;e a &s;udden Commoti|on
<PB N="13" REF="003975_0015_10034E53E59BFDA0">in the Soul, and could be of no U&s;e or Advan|tage at all to the Intere&s;t of Piety and Religion in it. But I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That an Expectation of modern Revelations of re|ligious Truths and Duties to any of the Children of God, would certainly be extreme dangerous:</HI> and that both to many of the &s;uppo&s;ed Subjects of &s;uch Revelati|ons, and to many others al&s;o.</P>
<P N="1">1. It would be very dangerous <HI>to many of the &s;uppo&s;ed Subjects of &s;uch Revelations.</HI> For though we have all the Rea&s;on in the World to think, that God (who hath given to Men a power of communicating their Tho'ts to one another, in &s;uch ways as that they may know a&s;&s;uredly from whom the Communication comes) can never want means Him&s;elf to make known his Mind to any of his Children &s;o effectually as that they may be as certain that the Revelation is from God, as they can be at any time that they hear the Words of their mo&s;t intimate Friends, when they are before their Eyes &s;peaking to them; and tho' it be not unrea&s;onable to think, that if any Per&s;on had been once favoured with a true divine Revelati|on, he would know the Operations of the Spirit of God too well, to be ever after impo&s;ed upon by the Sugge&s;tions of the Devil: yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions'tis very obvious, that were it once ta|ken for granted, that God did in the&s;e days make immediate Revelations of religious Truths and Du|ties to &s;ome of his Children, without atte&s;ting the Divinity of tho&s;e Revelations, by the Gi&s;ts of Pro|phe&s;y and Miracles, or &s;ome other way equally &s;a|tisfactory (which he hath never been known to do in later Ages) the great Adver&s;ary of Souls might &s;oon take the Advantage of it, to impre&s;s Delu&s;ions upon the Minds of many well di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons, who
<PB N="14" REF="003975_0016_10034D00332863C8">had never yet had any divine Revelations, with &s;o much Force and Subtilty, as to make them really think them&s;elves in&s;pired of God; when in truth they were only made to believe Lyes by the Craft and Power of the Devil. And that there would be real and great danger of &s;uch fatal Impo&s;itions from the Father of Lyes, if an Expectation and Belief of modern unatte&s;|ted Revelations &s;hould once prevail; is evident, not only from the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Suppo&s;ition, but al&s;o from what was Matters of Fact not much more than Twenty Years ago: when great Numbers of Peo|ple, fir&s;t in <HI>France</HI> and afterwards in <HI>England</HI> (and &s;ome of con&s;iderable Learning and Knowledge too, and of unblemi&s;h'd Life) were &s;o far drawn away by the Devices of Satan, as to think them&s;elves under the im|mediate Operations and Illuminations of the Holy Spi|rit; until at length in that Confidence they ventured &s;o far at Prophe&s;ies and Miracles, as to quite &s;poil the Credit of their &s;uppo&s;ed In&s;pirations.</P>
<P>But the&s;e things may &s;uffice for the Danger to which an Expectation and Belief of modern Revelati|ons of religious Truths and Duties would expo&s;e the <HI>imagin'd Subject</HI> of &s;uch Revelations. It only re|mains that I &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That &s;uch an Expectation and Belief would be ex|treme dangerous to many others al&s;o.</HI> For if &s;ome of the Children of God were now imagin'd to be favoured with immediate Revelations; then whatever <HI>they</HI> were &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak unto us by Revelation, ought not to be received as <HI>the Word of Man,</HI> but as the <HI>Word of God.</HI> And here a Difficulty would ari&s;e how we &s;hould know, who &s;pake by Revelation, and who did not? For unle&s;s we could know this, we &s;hould be at an utter Lo&s;s who&s;e Words we ought to receive as <HI>Oracles of God.</HI> And therefore for our Conduct in this difficult Affair, we mu&s;t either make it a Rule to believe every one, whom we look'd upon as a good Man, to &s;peak by immediate Revelation, as often as he was plea&s;ed to affirm he did, and we upon Enqui|ry
<PB N="15" REF="003975_0017_10034E59A44B9870">into Circum&s;tances could find no De&s;ign of Fraud: Or el&s;e every one who pretended to be favoured with divine Revelations, mu&s;t come recommended to us by &s;uch Evidences of a divine Mi&s;&s;ion as might &s;atisfy a rea&s;onable Enquirer, that he &s;pake not in <HI>the Words which Man's Wi&s;dom teacheth, but which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>un&s;peakable Mi&s;chiefs would follow to Mankind upon the former of the&s;e Suppo&s;als.</HI> For if we were to believe every one, whom we look'd upon as a good Man, to &s;peak by immediate Revelation, as often as he had A&s;&s;urance enough to affirm he did, and we upon Enquiry into Circum&s;tances could find no De&s;ign of Fraud (be&s;ides the &s;trong delu&s;ions &s;uch Men would be liable to them&s;elves, as was ob&s;erved under the fore|going head) it would open a Door for every bold Im|po&s;tor, who could hypocritically make a fair &s;hew of Religion, to impo&s;e upon us almo&s;t any Imaginations of his own Heart which he plea&s;ed. And in &s;uch a State of things there would &s;oon be a Multitude of In&s;tances of good Men drawn away by &s;uch Deceiv|ers, to act directly contrary to the Will of God re|vealed in the Scriptures.</P>
<P>And that this is not a groundle&s;s Surmi&s;e, but a well founded Suppo&s;ition, I think we may ea&s;ily &s;ati&s;|fy our &s;elves, by con&s;idering the tragical Story of the <HI>Man of God, who came out of Judah by the Word of the Lord unto Bethel,</HI> as it is reported 1 Kin. 13. He was <HI>commanded of God to prophe&s;ie again&s;t the Altar of Be|thel; and was al&s;o charged to eat no Bread, nor drink Wa|ter, nor turn again by the Way that he came</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">v. 2, 9.</NOTE> And if he could be under any Doubt, whether God was the Au|thor of the&s;e Charges or no, it mu&s;t be entirely taken away by the Fulfilment of <HI>the Sign which the Lord had &s;poken,</HI> in the <HI>renting of the Altar and the pouring out of the A&s;hes;</HI> and by the withering <HI>of the King's hand, and the re&s;toring of it at his Prayer</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">v. 3, 4, 5, 6.</NOTE> Upon this he with&s;tands the King's Invitation, tho' inforced with
<PB N="16" REF="003975_0018_10034E5F373EDA50">the Promi&s;e of a Reward; and &s;aith unto him, <HI>If thou wilt give me half thine Hou&s;e, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat Bread, nor drink Water in this place</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 7, 8.</NOTE>. And yet notwith&s;tanding this Re&s;olution, no &s;ooner comes <HI>the old Lyar of Bethel,</HI> and &s;aith unto him, <HI>I am a Prophet al&s;o as thou art, and an Angel &s;pake unto me by the Word of the Lord, &s;aying, bring him back with thee into thine Hou&s;e, that he may at Bread and drink Water</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 18.</NOTE>; but the Man of God belioving him upon his bare Word, without any Evidence of a divine Mi&s;&s;ion, tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the expre&s;s Command of God to him&s;elf thro' &s;uch Credulity, <HI>goes back with him, eats Bread and drinks Water in his hou&s;e, and is &s;lain by a Lion</HI> (upon his Return) <HI>for his Di&s;obedience to the Ward of the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 19, 24.</NOTE>. Now if one who was <HI>a Prophet</HI> might be &s;o &s;educed to act directly contrary to an expre&s;s Com|mand of God to him&s;elf, confirmed with &s;uch Signs following: by taking another to come with a contra|ry Revalation from God, upon his own bare Affirma|tion, without any &s;ufficient Evidence: how much ea&s;i|er may we well &s;uppo&s;e it, for Multitudes of Men of hone&s;t Minds, who are <HI>neither Prophets nor the Sons of Prophets,</HI> to be drawn into Apprehen&s;ions and Practices (e&s;pecially in Matters of po&s;itive In&s;titution) directly contrary to the Revelations of the Will of God con|tained in the holy Scriptures; if they &s;hould pre&s;ume any Men in our days to be favoured with divine Re|velations, only upon their own pretending to it, with|out God's bearing them Witne&s;s in any way what|ever.</P>
<P>And now upon the whole; if it be altogether need|le&s;s, and would be of no good U&s;e, but of &s;uch dange|rous Con&s;equences (as we have heard) for any of the Children of God in our days, and under the Circum|&s;tances of our modern Pretenders, to have religious Truths and Duties di&s;cover'd to them by immediate Revelation, I think, we need not be at any Lo&s;s at all, to conclude they have not. For it would be contrary
<PB N="17" REF="003975_0019_10034E6C12A5F4D0">to all the natural Notions we have of the divine Per|fections, and to all the Di&s;coveries God hath made of him&s;elf in his Word, to imagine Him expo&s;ing His Children to fatal Dangers, without any Nece&s;&s;ity, or propo&s;ing any Advantage to them by it.</P>
<P>And if to the&s;e Con&s;iderations we add, the frequent Warnings we have in the Scriptures, of <HI>fal&s;e Apo&s;tles, deceitful Workers, transforming them&s;elves into the Mi|ni&s;ters of Chri&s;t,</HI> and endeavouring <HI>to &s;educe, if po&s;&s;ible the very Elect;</HI> and that we are therefore wi&s;ely cau|tioned and charged in my Text, <HI>not to believe every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are of God;</HI> I think, we may &s;afely &s;et it down for a Rule, that we ought not to give heed to any Man's Preten&s;ions to divine Revelations of religious Truths and Duties, un|le&s;s he produces &s;uch Evidences as may be a rea&s;ona|ble Satisfaction to us, that the Spirit of God is in him.</P>

<P>Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are of God: becau&s;e many fal&s;e Prophets are gone out into the World.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Enquiry now before us is, <HI>What Evidences are &s;ufficient to give us a rea&s;onable Satisfaction, that any Man who pretends to have religious Truths and Duties di&s;covered to him in our Days by im|mediate Revelation, hath the Spirit of God in him of a Truth?</HI> The An&s;wer to this Enquiry will lead us in|to the &s;econd Thing propo&s;ed, which was,</P>
<P><HI>To try the Spirits of our modern Pretenders to divine Revelations, whether they are of God or no, by &s;uch Rutes as the Word of God &s;ugge&s;ts to us.</HI></P>
<P>And here I think I may truly affirm,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That me ought not to re&s;t &s;atisfied in any thing &s;hort of &s;uch Evidences as tho&s;e by which God was plea&s;ed to bear Witne&s;, to Mo&s;es and the Prophets, to Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, in ancient Times.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay, that nothing &s;hort of &s;uch Evidences as the&s;e, ought to &s;atis&s;y us now: becau&s;e that God hath as ten|der a Care of His Church now as ever; and from the frequent and &s;olemn Warnings of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf, and his Apo&s;tles, the Church of God &s;eems to be in as much Danger now as ever of <HI>Deceivers.</HI> And
<PB N="19" REF="003975_0021_10034DFD1E152C00">therefore we cannot &s;uppo&s;e it to be the Will of God, that his People &s;hould give Credit to Pretenders to divine Revelation now, upon weaker Evidences than he expected, that they &s;hould do &s;o in more ancient Times.</P>
<P>E&s;pecially if we con&s;ider, that we have no Intimati|ons in the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> that after the <HI>Canon</HI> of it &s;hould be compleated, we were to expect any more <HI>holy Men of Goa &s;peaking or writing to us, as they &s;hould be moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> But in&s;tead of this, the <HI>Canon</HI> of the New Te&s;tament is &s;ealed up with that awful Commination Rev. 22.18, 19. <HI>I te&s;tify unto every Man that heareth the Words of the Prophe&s;y of this Book, If any Man &s;hall add unto the&s;e things, God &s;hall add unto him the Plagues that are written in this Book. And if any Man &s;hall take away from the Words of the Book of this Prophe&s;y, God &s;hall take away his Part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy City, and from the things that are written in this Book.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas if we look back to the Times of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> we &s;hall find, That tho' <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;ays, <HI>ye &s;hall not add unto the Word which I command you, neither &s;hall you dimini&s;h ought from it.</HI> Deut. 4.2; yet he al&s;o &s;ays, Deut. 18.15. <HI>The Lord thy God will rai&s;e up unto thee a Prophet from the mid&s;t of thee, of thy Brethren, like unto me; unto him ye &s;hall hearken.</HI> Now whether we under&s;tand this Prediction of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> as the learned <HI>Grotius</HI> and &s;ome others do; not of any &s;ingle Per&s;on, but of a Succe&s;&s;ion of Prophets, as the Exigencies of the Church in the &s;everal Ages of it, during that Di&s;|pen&s;ation &s;hould call for: or whether we under&s;tand it accerding to the more general Opinion of Expo&s;itors, to intend (e&s;pecially at lea&s;t, if not only) Je&s;us the Mediator of the New Covenant, who alone re&s;embled <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in that which was the chief part of his Charac|ter as a Prophet, <HI>viz.</HI> in giving Laws in the Name of God, and being the Author of a Body of in&s;tituted Re|ligion: Which ever way we take it, it is a plain De|claration, that Prophe&s;y &s;hould not cea&s;e with <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="003975_0022_10034E7C51B1CCE8">but that the People of God might &s;till expect further. Revelations from him, for a great while to come.</P>
<P>And certain it is, That from this or other &s;uch Pre|dictions in the Old Te&s;tament, both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Samari|tans,</HI> how much &s;oever they differed in other Points in our Saviour's time, yet were well agreed in this; that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> whom they expected, was to be a <HI>Pro|phet.</HI> I know, &s;ays the Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> Joh. 4.25. <HI>that Me&s;&s;ias cometh which is called Chri&s;t; when he is come, he will tell us all things.</HI> And when our ble&s;&s;ed Lord had fed a great Multitude of <HI>Jews</HI> with Five Loaves and Two Fi&s;hes; <HI>then tho&s;e Men, when they had &s;een the Miracle that Je&s;us did, &s;aid, This is of a Truth that Prophet that &s;hould come into the World.</HI> John 6.14.</P>
<P>Once more, the marvellous De&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t upon the Di&s;ciples of our Lord on the day of Penteco&s;t (as the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, Act. 2.16, 17.) <HI>was nothing but what was &s;poken by the Prophet</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joel 2.28.</NOTE> Joel, <HI>And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s in the la&s;t days</HI> (&s;aith God) <HI>I will pour out of my Spirit upon all Fle&s;h: and your Sons and your Daughters &s;hall prophe&s;y,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>To conclude, Upon the &s;ealing up of the <HI>Canon</HI> of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> when the Spirit of Prophe&s;y was to be with held for a &s;ea&s;on, God charges His People, Mal. 4.4. <HI>Remember the Law of Mo&s;es my Ser|vant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all I&s;rael, with the Statutes &amp; Judgements.</HI> And yet he had told them but a little before <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. 3.1.</NOTE>, That <HI>the Lord whom they &s;ought &s;hould &s;uddenly come to his Temple.</HI> And he adds here <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mal. 4.5.</NOTE>, <HI>Behold I will &s;end you</HI> ELIJAH THE PRO|PHET, <HI>before the Coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Now upon the whole, if we compare the many plain Intimations in the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> of the Return of the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit of God in the Days of the <HI>New,</HI> with the profound Silence of
<PB N="21" REF="003975_0023_10034E7DD55F40A0">the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> as to any new Effu&s;ions of the ex|traordinary Gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, after the New Te&s;tament-Canon &s;hould be compleated; and e&s;peci|ally if we con&s;ider how all Expectation of any &s;uch Thing &s;eems to be cut off in the la&s;t Chapter of the <HI>Revelation;</HI> I think the lea&s;t Effect it can have upon us, mu&s;t be, to heighten our Su&s;picions of any Pretenders to immediate Revelations of religious Truths and Duties from God in our Days; and to ren|der it rea&s;onable for us to expect rather <HI>more</HI> than <HI>le&s;s Evidences</HI> that the Spirit of God is in them, than <HI>tho&s;e</HI> by which he was wont to bear Witne&s;s to his extra|ordinary Me&s;&s;engers in the Days of the Old and New Te&s;tament. And this brings me to con&s;ider, what tho&s;e Evidences were.</P>
<P>Now <HI>the Evidences by which God was plea&s;ed in an|cient Times to bear Witne&s;s to his extraordinary Me&s;|&s;engers, were principally &s;uch as the&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>(1.) <HI>Sometimes the Be&s;towment of an Ability to fore|tell Things to come; or to do &s;uch Works, as it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that God would enable, or even &s;uffer, Men to do for the Confirmation of Fal&s;ehoods in Religion; or both.</HI></P>
<P>Both the&s;e Evidences certainly concurred in <HI>Mo|&s;es:</HI> The Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture which prove it, are too many, and too well known, to need to be men|tioned. It is highly probable al&s;o, that both the&s;e Evidences concurred in mo&s;t, it not all, the <HI>Pro|phets</HI> that followed <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> during the Times of the Old Te&s;tament. For as to all tho&s;e who&s;e Writings remain, we are &s;ure, either from their own Books which are &s;till in our hands, or from Hints given us el&s;ewhere in the Scripture, that they foretold things to come. And as for others of them, who have left no Writings upon &s;acred Record, &s;uch as the <HI>Man of God from Judah,</HI> mentioned in the preceeding Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>Elijah</HI> the <HI>Ti&s;hbite,</HI> Eli&s;ha &amp;c.) we are
<PB N="22" REF="003975_0024_10034E84306A8BE8">neverthele&s;s expre&s;sly told, both of their Predicti|ons, and of their Miracles. And if we con&s;ider the Severity of that Law, Deut. 18.20. <HI>The Pro|phet which &s;hall pre&s;ume to &s;peak a word in my Name, which I have not commanded him to &s;peak,&mdash;even that Prophet &s;hall die;</HI> and the Rule which God gives in <HI>ver.</HI> 22, <HI>how the People &s;hould know the Word which the Lord had not &s;poken;</HI> we may very well conclude that God always enabled his Servants the Prophets (at lea&s;t in their beginning to &s;peak in his Name, before their Authority could be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Fulfil|ment of their Predictions) to give &s;ome convincing Sign to tho&s;e that heard them (it there was Oc|ca&s;ion for it) that they had a Command from God for what they &s;aid: As we are a&s;&s;ured, he did in the Ca&s;es of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> of the <HI>Man of God from Judah,</HI> of <HI>Elijab</HI> and others <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P>And therefore when our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t re|&s;ents it, that the <HI>Scribes, Phari&s;ees</HI> and <HI>Sadducees</HI> once and again <HI>asked a Sign of him,</HI> even <HI>a Sign from Heaven</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 12.38.-16.

For he &s;ays in Contradiction to any Surmi&s;e like the Fir&s;t of the&s;e, Joh. 15.24. <HI>If I had not done among them the Works which none other Man did, they had not had Sin;</HI> And in Oppo&s;ition to the latter he &s;ays, Joh.

<P>I think I need not &s;ay any more concerning the <HI>mighty Works</HI> with which <HI>the Mi&s;&s;ion of our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t was con&s;irm'd from Heaven.</HI> Nor need I &s;ay any thing of His <HI>Prophe&s;ies,</HI> which are &s;o well known, and have been &s;o exactly fulfilled.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="003975_0026_10034E93194F1488">
I &s;hall only add concerning his holy <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> in the Words of the Author of the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> Chap. 2 ver. 3.4. <HI>That the great Salvation which at fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord, was confirmed to us by them that heard him; God al&s;o bearing them Witne&s;s, both with Signs and Wonders, and with diver&s;e Mira|cles and Gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But the&s;e things may &s;uffice for the Fir&s;t Way in which God was &s;ometimes plea&s;ed in the days of the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> to <HI>bear Witne&s;s</HI> to his extraordinary Me&s;&s;engers. I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P>(2) <HI>That God &s;ometimes te&s;tified the divine Mi&s;&s;ion of His Servants the Prophets, by doing &s;ome wonderful Work him&s;elf for the Confirmation of it.</HI></P>
<P>Not the Prophets, but God Him&s;elf &s;ometimes gave a Sign. Thus he declares he will do to the <HI>Hou&s;e of 'David,</HI> for the Con&s;irmation of His Me&s;|&s;age by the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiab,</HI> I&s;a. 7.14. And thus he did al&s;o in the Ca&s;e of the Prophet <HI>Jonah:</HI> for <HI>the Lord prepared a great Fi&s;h to &s;wallow up Jonah, and Jo|nah was in the Belly of the Fi&s;h three days and three nights. And the Lord &s;pake unto the Fi&s;h, and it vomit|ed out Jonah upon the dry Land.</HI> Jon. 1.17.-2.10. Now tho' the Scriptures have not informed us, how the <HI>Ninevites</HI> came to the Knowledge of this won|derful Work of God, yet we are certain from the Scriptures, that they are not ignorant of it, and that this was a Sign to them of the divine Mi&s;&s;ion of the Prophet. For we read, Luk. 11.30. That <HI>as Jo|nah was a Sign to the Ninevites, &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the Son of Man be to this Generation.</HI> That is (to borrow the Words of Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> with a little Alteration) <Q>As the Preaching of <HI>Jonah</HI> in the Streets of <HI>Nine|veh,</HI> atte&s;ted with the Miracle of having been three days in the Whale's Belly, and then being
<PB N="25" REF="003975_0027_10034E96216BDCC8">ca&s;t upon the Shore alive, was an A&s;&s;urance to them, that without Repentance they &s;hould &s;pee|dily be de&s;troyed: &s;o &s;hall the Preaching of Chri&s;t to the Men of this Age, atte&s;ted with his Death and Re&s;urrection after three days, be a certain Fore-runner of De&s;truction to you that believe not.</Q> Upon which we may ob&s;erve, That even our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t Him&s;elf had this Evidence al&s;o of His divine Mi&s;&s;ion, as well as the others above-mentioned. For not only did He Him&s;elf prove his Mi&s;&s;ion from God by Prophefies and Miracles; but <HI>God al&s;o gave A&s;&s;u|rance of it unto all Men in that He rai&s;ed Him from the dead.</HI> But I ha&s;ten to &s;ay,</P>
<P>(3.) <HI>That &s;ometimes the 'Proof of the divine Mi&s;&s;ion of God's extraordinary Me&s;&s;engers might be fetched from Antecedent Prophe&s;ies concerning them.</HI></P>
<P>This Sort of Proof our <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Lord Him&s;elf</HI> don't think it unbecoming the Dignity of His Per&s;on and Offices to have Recour&s;e to. For after he had &s;aid, Joh. 5.36. <HI>The Works which the Father hath given me to fini&s;h, the &s;ame Works that I do, bear Witne&s;s of me, that the Father hath &s;ent me;</HI> He adds Ver. 39. <HI>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eter|nal Life, and they are they which te&s;tify of me;</HI> and again Ver. 46. <HI>Had ye believed Mo&s;es, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</HI></P>
<P>And this was the Ca&s;e of <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> who had been &s;poken of under the Name of <HI>Elijah</HI> by the Prophet <HI>Malachi</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. 4.5.</NOTE>; and who&s;e Birth and Ser|vice had been foretold to his <HI>Father</HI> by an <HI>Angel,</HI> and a Sign given to confirm the Prediction <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luk, 1, 13, 20.</NOTE> <HI>And all the&s;e things were noi&s;ed abroad throughout all the
<PB N="26" REF="003975_0028_10034E97AB9B6420">Hill Country of Judea. And all they that heard them, laid them up in their Hearts, &s;aying, what manner of Child &s;hall this be</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 65, 66.</NOTE>? In fine, tho' the People &s;ay of <HI>John,</HI> that <HI>he did no Miracle,</HI> yet they add, that <HI>all things that he &s;pake of Chri&s;t were true</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. 10.41.</NOTE>: which was an Acknowledgment that <HI>John</HI> had the Gift of Pro|phecy.</P>
<P>And now upon the whole: Since God hath al|ways (&s;o far as we can learn from Scripture) given &s;ome &s;uch Evidences as the&s;e of the divine Mi&s;&s;ion of His Servants, when He expected, that Men &s;hould believe that they &s;peak by Revelation from Him; &s;ince our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf tho't it nece&s;&s;ary to have Recour&s;e to &s;uch &s;ort of Proofs that the Father had &s;ent Him; and &s;ince it is rea|&s;onable for us to expect rather <HI>more</HI> than <HI>le&s;s</HI> Evi|dences that the Spirit of God is in &s;uch as pretend to immediate Revelations from him in our Days, than <HI>tho&s;e</HI> by which he was wont to bear Witne&s;s to His extraordinary Me&s;&s;engers in the Days of the Old and New Te&s;tament; I think we may very fairly conclude, that till the modern Pretenders to divine Revelations can either prove, that they and their Mi&s;&s;ion have been foretold &s;omewhere or other in the Scriptures of the Old or New Te&s;ta|ment; or can make it appear that God Him&s;elf hath given &s;ome &s;ufficient Sign of their Mi&s;&s;ion from Him, like that of Delivering <HI>Jonah</HI> from the Whale's Belly, or the Rai&s;ing up our Saviour from the Dead; or till they can &s;atisfy us, that they them&s;elves are endued from on high with the Gi&s;ts of Prophecy or Miracles, or both, to &s;upport the Credit of their pretended Revelations; Or can give
<PB N="27" REF="003975_0029_10034EA3591DB000">us &s;ome other as good Evidences as the&s;e, that God is with them of a Truth; they mu&s;t allow us, in obedience to the Warnings and Cautions given us in the Scriptures, to number them with Men under <HI>&s;trong Delu&s;ions,</HI> or with <HI>fal&s;e Prophets</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters of Satan.</HI> And to the&s;e Things I mu&s;t add,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That upon Suppo&s;ition that any modern Pretender to divine Revelation &s;hould give any Sign or Wonder; yet if the Doctrine which it is wrought in Confirmation of, &s;hould be manife&s;tly contradictory to any Article of the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, according to which Men are to be judged at the la&s;t Day; or &s;hould be notoriou&s;ly Wicked in its Nature; or evidently tending to open the Door to all manner of Wickedne&s;s, by ridding us of that Fear, not of Man only but of God al&s;o, which is the Be|ginning of Wi&s;dom; Tho' the Sign &s;hould be &s;uch an one, as that if it had been given for a better Purpo&s;e, we &s;hould hardly (if at all) have been able to di&s;tingui&s;h it from a Divine Miracle; Yet in &s;uch a Ca&s;e the Fal&s;e|ne&s;s or Wickedne&s;s of the Doctrine de&s;ign'd to be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by it, would be a &s;ufficient Pooof, that the Wonder was not of God, but of the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>For we are not more certain that God is powerful, than we are that he is al&s;o wi&s;e, ju&s;t, good, and true. And therefore the &s;eeming Greatne&s;s or Dif|ficulty of any Work can never per&s;wade us to be|lieve it an Effect of Divine Power, if it be wrought to confirm a Doctrine, which we certainly know to be incon&s;i&s;tent with God's Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, Truth or Goodne&s;s. But on the contrary, a certain Know|ledge of the Wickedne&s;s of the Nature or Tenden|cy of any Doctrine; or of its Contradictorine&s;s to &s;uch Revelations of the Will of God as can never be rever&s;ed, (becau&s;e Men are to be judg'd accord|ing to them at the great Day) and which God hath
<PB N="28" REF="003975_0030_10034EAD75678DF8">born Witne&s;s to by Signs and Wonders, Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t for an whole Age to|gether; will be a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for us to account any Wonder wrought in Confirmation of &s;uch a Doctrine to be only a <HI>lying Wonder</HI> wrought by the <HI>Wicked one.</HI> For in &s;uch a Ca&s;e it mu&s;t be more evident, that the Doctrine is fal&s;e or wicked, than it can be, that &s;uch a Wonder could be wrought by nothing le&s;s than divine Power.</P>
<P>And as it is plain to <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> that no Sign or Wonder can be &s;ufficient to give Credit to a Doc|trine, when it is more evident, that the Doctrine is fal&s;e or wicked, than it is, that &s;uch a Wonder could be wrought by nothing le&s;s than divine Pow|er; &s;o it hath been the Opinion of &s;everal pious and very learned Men, that it appears from <HI>Scripture,</HI> that God may &s;ometimes permit &s;uch Wonders to be wrought for the &s;upport of Doctrines notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e or wicked, as can be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Effects of a Power truly divine by nothing but the evident Ab&s;urdity or Vilene&s;s of the Doctrine they are de&s;ign'd to give Credit to. This Opinion they found upon that Pa&s;&s;age, Deut. 13.1, 2, 3. <HI>If there ari&s;e among you a Prophet, or a Dreamer of Dreams, and giveth thee a Sign or a Wonder, and the Sign or the Wonder come to pa&s;s, whereof he &s;pake unto thee, &s;ay|ing, Let us go after other Gods (which thou ha&s;t not known) and let us &s;erve them: Thou &s;halt not hearken to that Prophet, or that Dreamer of Dreams: for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether you love the Lord your Grd with all your Heart, and with all your Soul.</HI> Hence they &s;uppo&s;e (and I think very ju&s;tly) that God might (to prove His People) &s;uffer a fal&s;e Pro|phet to give &s;uch a Sign or Wonder, to entice them to Idolatry, as could not be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by any
<PB N="29" REF="003975_0031_10034EB1711F3200">thing but the De&s;ign of it, from a true Miracle: be|cau&s;e the <HI>Service</HI> of the <HI>Heathen Gods</HI> was &s;o ab&s;urd and wicked, and contradictory to the Light of Na|ture, as to be alone &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the Credit of any Wonders, that could be wrought to &s;educe tho&s;e into it who were acquainted with the Rea&s;onable Service of the true God.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Another Way in which the Credit of any won|derful Works, how great &s;oever, may be de&s;troyed, is by God's exerting a &s;uperiour Power in Contradiction to them.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Thus He did in ancient times by the Wonders of the <HI>Magicians</HI> of <HI>Egypt;</HI> whom he &s;uffered to with&s;tand His Servants <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> for &s;ome time; and to do, or &s;eem to do, &s;ome won|derful Works like to theirs; for <HI>Aaron ca&s;t his Rod upon the Ground, and it became a Serpent,</HI> and &s;o did they <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 7.10, 12.</NOTE>: and <HI>Aaron &s;tretched out his hand over the Waters, and the Frogs came up and cover|ed the Land of Egypt. And the Magicians did &s;o with their Enchantments, and brought up Frogs upon the Land of Egypt</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod. 8.6.7,</NOTE>. But tho' He &s;uffered the <HI>Magicians</HI> thus to contend with His Prophets, yet he gave the Victory clearly on his Prophets Side. For: <HI>Aaron's Rod &s;wallowed up their Rods</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Exod. 7.12.</NOTE>; and when the <HI>Magicians</HI> endeavoured <HI>by their Enchant|ments to bring forth Lice,</HI> as <HI>Aaron</HI> had done, they <HI>could not;</HI> but were forced to own before <HI>Pha|roah,</HI> that it was the Finger of God <NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod. 8.18.19.</NOTE>; and from that Time forward &s;trove no more for Victory.</Q> So that there was no Danger, that either <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> or <HI>Egyptians</HI> &s;hould be led into any Error by the Wonders of the <HI>Magicians;</HI> becau&s;e God immedi|ately enabled his Servants to contradict and con|found
<PB N="30" REF="003975_0032_10034EB3178A2B38">them, by more wonderful Works on the other &s;ide: And therefore in this Ca&s;e, it was not at all incon&s;i&s;tent with the Wi&s;dom or Goodne&s;s of God, to permit the Devil to do marvellous Things; be|cau&s;e He took effectual Care to prevent any Bo|dy's being nece&s;&s;arily and fatally mi&s;led by them, and rendered His own Power more ob&s;ervable and glorious, by &s;uffering the <HI>Magicians</HI> to conte&s;t with Him for a time. And if God ever &s;hould, for wi&s;e and holy Ends unknown to us, in our Times, or in Ages to come, &s;uffer any fal&s;e Pretenders to divine Revelations, <HI>after the working of Satan</HI> to &s;upport their Preten&s;ions with &s;uch Signs and Wonders, as could no other way be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the real Effects of divine Power; we may &s;afely confide in his Goodne&s;s, that He would, as in the Days of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> exert a &s;uperiour Power in Contradiction to them; and not &s;uffer tho&s;e <HI>who receive the Love of the Truth that they may be &s;aved,</HI> to be over|born with &s;uch <HI>&s;trong Delu&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only add,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That we can never &s;afely depend upon it, if we are Strangers to a Man's Character, that he comes with a Me&s;&s;age by immediate Revelation from God to us, any further than He confirms the divine Authority of &s;uch Me&s;&s;age by &s;ome &s;ufficient Evidence.</HI></P>
<P>For I have proved in the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e, that &s;ome very wicked Men have <HI>heard the Words of God,</HI> and <HI>&s;een the Vi&s;ions of the Almighty,</HI> and <HI>prophe&s;ied in his Name.</HI> And yet, if we &s;hould believe &s;uch a Man to <HI>come unto us by the Word of the Lord,</HI> without his giving any &s;ufficient Proof of a divine Mi&s;&s;ion at that time, only becau&s;e we have known or heard, that he hath &s;ometimes been favoured with divine Revelations; we can't be &s;ecure, that we &s;hall not be &s;erved, as the <HI>Man of God from
<PB N="31" REF="003975_0033_10035448202B61D0">Judah</HI> was by the <HI>Old lying Prophet of Bethel.</HI> It is not enough therefore, that we be per&s;waded, that a Man hath &s;ometimes been favoured with imme|diate Revelations from God: but we ought al&s;o to be &s;atisfied, that he is not under the predominant Power of Covetou&s;ne&s;s or Pride, or any other cor|rupt Affection, but is one that truly fears God: Or el&s;e we cannot &s;afely tru&s;t him upon the Cre|dit of former Revelations, any further than he gives &s;ufficient Evidence of the divine Authority of every particular Me&s;&s;age, which he may pre&s;ume to come to us with in the Name of God.</P>
<P>And now upon the whole: If you &s;hould ever hear of any <HI>New Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> or if any pretended <HI>Pro|phets</HI> &s;hould <HI>come forth into the World</HI> in our days: the Thoughts which have been offered at this time may be improved, as &s;o many Directions for your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in <HI>trying the Spirits whether they are of God.</HI></P>
<P>I therefore de&s;ire you would be careful to re|member, what I hope has been &s;ufficiently proved above; and what I recapitulate on purpo&s;e to refre&s;h your Memories: namely,</P>
<P>That you ought not to re&s;t &s;atisfied with <HI>weaker Evidences</HI> of the divine Mi&s;&s;ion of Pretenders to Re|velations from God in our Days, than <HI>tho&s;e</HI> with which God tho't it nece&s;&s;ary to bear Witne&s;s to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> and His <HI>A|po&s;tles</HI> in ancient Times.</P>
<P>That even &s;ome of <HI>the&s;e</HI> are not alone of Force enough to command your A&s;&s;ent; but that you ought al&s;o to take in the Con&s;ideration of the Nature and Tendency of the Doctrines to which they may be de&s;ign'd to give Credit; and of the Conduct of the governing Providence of God with re&s;pect to them.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="003975_0034_10035449A3DF45F8">
That the manife&s;t Wickedne&s;s of the Nature or Tendency of any pretended New Revelation; or its Contradictorine&s;s to &s;uch Ancient Revelations of the Will of God, as are never to be revers'd, and as have been confirmed by Signs and Wonders, Mira|cles and Gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t for an whole Age together; will be &s;ufficient to &s;poil the Credit of any Sign or Wonder which may be wrought for its Support; and to prove that &s;uch Sign or Wonder was not of God, but of the Devil.</P>
<P>That the Credit of any wonderful Work will likewi&s;e be de&s;troyed, if God &s;hould exert a &s;uperi; our Power in Contradiction to it.</P>
<P>In fine, that when you are in any mea&s;ure Stran|gers to the moral Character of a Pretender to divine Revelations, you cannot &s;afely tru&s;t him upon the Credit of former Revelations; but may rea&s;onably expect, that he &s;hould give &s;ufficient Evidence of the divine Authority of every particular Me&s;&s;age, which be may pre&s;ume to come to you with in the Name of the Lord.</P>
<P>And to the&s;e things you ought to add a Con&s;cien|tious Endeavour to <HI>do the Will of God,</HI> &s;o far as you know it; and &s;ervent Prayers in the Name of Chri&s;t that God may have no <HI>Cau&s;e to &s;end you &s;trong De|lu&s;ion, that you &s;hould believe a Lie.</HI></P>
<P>If you &s;hall ob&s;erve the&s;e few Directions, I tru&s;t you <HI>will not be carried about with diver&s;e and &s;trange Doctrines,</HI> but will be e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>upon the Foundati|on of the Apo&s;tles and Prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t Him&s;elf|ing the chief Corner Stone.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude: If <HI>&s;ome</HI> &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e Direc|tions to be needle&s;s, and <HI>others</HI> &s;hould apprehend
