<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL not make any apology for what is here offered to the public, the importance of the &s;ubjects being &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the inve&s;tigation thereof. On reading the forementioned pamphlet, I ob&s;erved, that whatever rea&s;ons the author had met with (which divers worthy members of our religious &s;ociety have with chri&s;tian ingenuity given thereon) they have fell &s;hort of convincing his under&s;tanding of the rectitude of our &s;entiments in the re&s;pects treated on; which is no indication of want of ability, but want of opportunity; for it is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that they &s;hould adapt an&s;wers to every ob|jection that in future might be made; or that they &s;hould do the work of their day and ours al&s;o. An idea like this, entertained in an unbelieving heart, has in many ages greatly retarded the reformation, which as yet has made but little progre&s;s, for the world &s;till lies in wickedne&s;s. I am not in&s;en&s;ible of the difficulty attendant on combating with popular opinions, flowing from the influence of education, and &s;upported by the cu&s;tom of many ages: it is imma|terial
<PB N="iv" REF="022648_0003_0FB9C0AA8EAE2208">whether tho&s;e cu&s;toms be well or ill founded, with re&s;pect to their detention of the mind, they equally militate again&s;t things offered not coincident therewith; many of my readers being of this cla&s;s, it would be irrational to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch will be wholly dive&s;ted of prejudices, &s;o as to be impartial in the examination of the &s;ubjects hereafter treated on: when the &s;entiments of the reader &s;tand oppo&s;ed to the matters propo&s;ed, except he can &s;u&s;pend them during the con&s;ideration, he will be under an utter incapacity of weighing things in the balance of equi|ty. It is the unbia&s;&s;ed only that can judge impar|tially.</P>
<P>As heaven is higher than the earth, &s;o in like pro|portion are the things pertaining to &s;alvation &s;uperior to temporal con&s;iderations; of which number I con|ceive the following matters to be. As to the &s;crip|tures which Francis Herr endeavours to prove to be the everla&s;ting Word of God, I have endeavoured to di&s;criminate between them and the everla&s;ting Word; but if any will have them called the Word, they ought for di&s;tinction to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> them the written Word, for they are not everla&s;ting. As to water Bapti&s;m, which F. H. endeavours to prove to be an ordinance of Chri&s;t, commanded and enjoined by him to be perpetuated and practi&s;ed on all Chri&s;ti|ans, I have endeavoured to demon&s;trate it to be John's di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>As to the heavenly Bapti&s;m which Chri&s;t com|manded, I believe it nece&s;&s;ary to be experienced by every &s;on and daughter of Adam, ere they can enter the kingdom of heaven. How important then mu&s;t it be, to be rightly under&s;tood! Is it not high time, that men &s;hould entertain a jealou&s;y re&s;pecting cle|mentary Bapti&s;m, ina&s;much as it has proved no re|medy again&s;t &s;in, and fruitle&s;s of &s;alvation? To de|fine preci&s;ely whether our Lord commanded water or
<PB N="v" REF="022648_0004_0FB9C0AC93ED5950">the Spirit for this purpo&s;e, is what I have principally aimed at, and &s;hall leave the reader to judge of my &s;ucce&s;s. As to the order of time referred to, re&s;pect|ing tran&s;actions mentioned in Scriptures, I have de|pended on its chronology. In treating on the peace|able kingdom of Chri&s;t, I have not attempted it ob|jectively, except in two or three in&s;tances near the conclu&s;ion, but have endeavoured to illu&s;trate the way and manner, by which I believe his kingdom will be advanced in the earth, which I think is agree|able to the &s;cripture te&s;timony, and the &s;preading of primitive Chri&s;tianity. In all which my de&s;ign has been more to clear the truth from mi&s;apprehen&s;ions, and long practi&s;ed une&s;&s;ential ordinances, than to ex|ult in a victory over my opponent; therefore I have omitted taking notice of &s;everal plain contradictions in his pamphlet.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I. <HI>Re&s;pecting the Scriptures.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, re&s;pecting the Scriptures, our writings at large fully exhibit our &s;en&s;e and ap|probation of them to the world; we e&s;teem them an hi&s;torical relation, in which is included an unparal|leled train of memorable events (viz.) the maje&s;ty, power, and greatne&s;s of the Almighty, in the produc|tion of the univer&s;e; his laws, commandments, te&s;|timonies, mercies, and judgments, di&s;pen&s;ed to man|kind, intermixed with the moral actions and &s;ayings of men of various de&s;criptions, for the &s;pace of above 4000 years.</P>
<P>The world abounds with hi&s;tories of an inferior kind, &s;o that few are at a lo&s;s to know, that a hi&s;|tory is only a de&s;cription or declaration of a thing, and not the thing it&s;elf. Therefore the Scriptures are not the everla&s;ting Word; for John &s;aith, "In the beginning was the Word;" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John i. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE> but the Scriptures
<PB N="8" REF="022648_0006_0FB9C0B192C918E8">were not in the beginning: "And the Word was with God:" but the bible was not with him. "And the Word was God:" but it would be very impi|ous to &s;ay, that the Scriptures were God. "The &s;ame was in the beginning with God; all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made." But the bible never made any thing, vi&s;ible nor invi&s;ible. "And the Word was made fle&s;h, and dwelt among us." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John i. ver&s;e 14.</NOTE> &amp;c. but the Scriptures never became fle&s;h. I humbly think the Apo&s;tle here furni&s;hes every unprejudiced reader with materials, that with indubitable clearne&s;s di&s;criminate between the everla&s;ting Word and tho&s;e &s;acred repo&s;itories. The commandments were given for a guide to frail man; and the law, as Paul &s;aith, "was added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Galatians iii. 19.</NOTE> And Mo|&s;es, the earlie&s;t writer that we know of, lived about 2500 years after the beginning alluded to by the Apo&s;tle, therefore the books under notice are not that Word, becau&s;e the mo&s;t antient of them were not in the beginning; but this Word was the &s;ame which Mo&s;es directed the attention of I&s;rael to, when he &s;aid, "the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou maye&s;t do it." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxx. 14.</NOTE> This in&s;peaking Word not only &s;trove with the I&s;|raelites and the Antediluvians, but al&s;o with all the offspring of Adam, being nigh unto them in their hearts, &amp;c. both before and &s;ince the Scriptures were wrote. Paul &s;aith, "The manife&s;tation of the Spi|rit is given to every man to profit withal." <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xx. 7.</NOTE> That this could not be the Scriptures, is abundantly evident, becau&s;e from the beginning to this day, the greater part of mankind have not had the benefit of them. David &s;ays, "Thy Word is very pure,
<PB N="9" REF="022648_0007_0FB9C0B510D78DD0">therefore thy &s;ervant loveth it." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxix. 140.</NOTE> This could not be &s;aid of any of the books then extant, becau&s;e as be|fore hinted, there are many relations of matters and &s;ayings included, that are moral in their nature, and &s;ome of them &s;peeches of impious men and women, and con&s;equently remote from purity; &s;uch as the &s;peech of Lamech to his two wives, of Jo&s;eph's mi&s;|tre&s;s to her hu&s;band, of Korah in his rebellion again&s;t Mo&s;es, al&s;o of Goliath, Saul, the Witch of Endor, Shimei, &amp;c. This Word, which was without be|ginning or end of days, the Scriptures &s;peak large|ly of; but I do not under&s;tand any of the &s;acred writers in the &s;en&s;e our author does, neither can I find, that they de&s;igned to have them con&s;idered as the Word to which they impute &s;uch wonderful ef|fects, but through them to direct men to the Word for guidance and in&s;truction. Ob&s;erve our Lord's reproof to the Jews (viz.) "Ye have not his Word abiding in you; for whom he hath &s;ent, him ye be|lieve not. Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which te&s;tify of me, and ye will not come unto me that ye might have life." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John v. 38.</NOTE> Perhaps no people in the world were more &s;tudious in the Scriptures than they were, which is evident from their expectations thro' them to obtain eternal life; yet our Lord plainly told them, that they had not his Word abiding in them, which is a &s;ufficient proof, that he did not call the Old Te&s;tament the Word. The Apo&s;tle Paul tells us, that "The Sword of the Spirit, is the Word of God." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 17.</NOTE> Al&s;o, "The Word is quick and powerful, &amp;c. &s;harper than any two-edged &s;word, piercing even to the dividing a&s;under of &s;oul and &s;pirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a di&s;|cerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; nei|ther
<PB N="10" REF="022648_0008_0FB9C0BB8AFE83A0">is there any creature that is not manife&s;t in his &s;ight, but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. iv. 12, 13.</NOTE> Is it po&s;|&s;ible, that any enlightened man can be &s;o ignorant, as to &s;uppo&s;e that the Old and New Te&s;tament is here meant, or that they have &s;uch power and capa|city of knowing, dividing a&s;under and di&s;cerning; &s;urely no&mdash;for the &s;ame Apo&s;tle &s;aid, "Our &s;uffici|ency is of God, who al&s;o hath made us able mini&s;|ters of the New Te&s;tament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giv|eth life." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE> "But if the mini&s;tration of death writ|ten and engraven in &s;tones was glorious," &amp;c. Here the Apo&s;tle, by repre&s;enting the commandments writ|ten with the finger of God, as the mini&s;tration of death, plainly proves, that it was the letter of the Scriptures which he meant that killeth; thereby ex|hibiting a caution to the believers, that they might not place their tru&s;t and dependance on any written pre&s;criptions, but on the Word or Spirit which only giveth life. It was through a bare adherance unto, and unwarrantable expectations from the Scriptures, that rendered the Jews lifele&s;s and de&s;titute of the Word, or a right knowledge of them; and many &s;ince them have erred on that ground. They doubt|le&s;s thought as our author and many others do, that the Scriptures were the Word, as their high expec|tations evince; for nothing below that all-creating power could admini&s;ter life, therefore they remain|ed in&s;en&s;ible, in a &s;tate where woful di&s;appointment inevitably awaited them.</P>
<P>Since by the Word all things were created and are &s;u&s;tained, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible; and that it was that Rock and Foundation that followed and conducted I&s;rael in their movements in the wilderne&s;s, which
<PB N="11" REF="022648_0009_0FB9C0C026816FE8">the Apo&s;tle &s;ays was Chri&s;t then it was the Word in the beginning that &s;pake, and &s;aid, let it be &s;o, and it was &s;o. The words &s;poken were the words of the Word, and not the Word it&s;elf, as &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable pa&s;&s;ages in Scripture evince, where the Almighty vocally uttered the commandments and &s;tatutes, &amp;c. to I&s;rael: he called them the words, but not the Word (viz.) "The&s;e are the words which thou &s;halt &s;peak unto the Children of I&s;rael." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xix. 6, 7.</NOTE> "All the&s;e words which the Lord commanded him." "And God &s;pake all the&s;e words, &s;aying, I am the Lord thy God," <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod. xx. 1, 2.</NOTE> &amp;c. "And the Lord &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, write thou the&s;e words; for after the te|nor of the&s;e words," &amp;c. "And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten command|ments." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxxiv. 27, 28.</NOTE> "The&s;e are the words which the Lord hath commanded," <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxxv. 1.</NOTE> &amp;c. "And the&s;e words which I command thee this day, &s;hall be in thine heart," <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Deut. vi. 6.</NOTE> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Francis Herr thinks he has proved &s;omething in the following quotations (viz.) "And this is the Word of the Lord." "Hear ye the Word of the Lord." "The Word of the Lord came al&s;o unto me." "The Word of the Lord came unto me," &amp;c. with divers more to the &s;ame import; to which I an|&s;wer in the words of Chri&s;t, who is the Word, "For it is not ye that &s;peak, but the Spirit of your Father that &s;peaketh in you." <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Matt. x. 20.</NOTE> From which it is plain, that the Prophets and Servants of the Mo&s;t High were not mi&s;taken, when they informed tho&s;e to whom they were &s;ent, that they had the Word of the Lord; for his Spirit was upon them, and his power, which is the Word, was with them. They were only pu|rified, cho&s;en and prepared vehicles, through which
<PB N="12" REF="022648_0010_0FB9C0C256C04B88">the Word &s;pake: it would be equally true to &s;ay, it was not them that &s;pake, but the Word that &s;pake through them, for the Spirit of Chri&s;t &s;pake through the Prophets under the law, for "The Prophets have enquired," &amp;c. "Searching what or what man|ner of time the Spirit of Chri&s;t which was in them did &s;ignify, when it te&s;tified beforehand the &s;uffer|ings of Chri&s;t, and the glory that &s;hould follow." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 10, 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>Behold in what point of view Peter and John con|&s;idered the Word, "Being born again, not of cor|ruptible &s;eed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever." "But the Word of the Lord endureth for ever, and this is the Word which by the go&s;pel is preached unto you." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 23, 25.</NOTE> Which Word is Chri&s;t&mdash;for as St. Paul &s;aith, "We preach not our&s;elves, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord," <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 5.</NOTE> &amp;c. Again: "I have written unto you young men, becau&s;e ye are &s;trong, and the Word of God abid|eth in you," <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 John xi. 14.</NOTE> &amp;c. From all which it is abundantly evident, that the Saints when &s;peaking of the Word, did not mean any written pre&s;criptions, however a|cred, but the power, &s;en&s;ible pre&s;ence, and Spirit of God, which they often expre&s;&s;ed under various ap|pellations, which impre&s;s our minds with ideas of wonderful efficacy, incomprehen&s;ible power, imma|culate purity, and eternal exi&s;tence, and not tran&s;|mutable by mortals, therefore not any thing reduci|ble to ink and paper, things de&s;titute of power, and incapable of motion.</P>
<P>This is a clear point, that all that has ever been uttered or written for man's in&s;truction, from the foundation of the world; or that ever will be to the late&s;t period of time, are included under the de|nomination of records, te&s;timonies, or declarations of God's Spirit; and that all vi&s;ible and material
<PB N="13" REF="022648_0011_0FB9C0C680D7CE18">things mu&s;t terminate. "For the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat; the earth al&s;o, and the works that are therein, &s;hall be burnt up." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Peter iii. 10.</NOTE> This will doubtle&s;s be verified, literally as well as my&s;tically, but the Word will &s;tand and abide for ever.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations, however oppo&s;ite to popular ideas, are I think well founded upon, and plainly deducible from Scripture, free from any &s;ubtilty or unwarrantable philo&s;ophy; and in my &s;en&s;e the in|&s;pired writers have &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed the words uttered from that All-powerful Word from whence they proceeded; and it is equally nece&s;&s;ary for us to continue proper di&s;tinctions, otherwi&s;e we &s;hall con|found cau&s;es with their effects, and finally land in perplexity: and wherein are the Scriptures depreci|ated, by the term of Holy writ? Holy is an high epithet; it is imputed to the Great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e, and therefore cannot degrade the effects; and we think it un&s;afe for us, who thus under&s;tand the Word, to give that denomination to the Scriptures, le&s;t we al|&s;o fall into the condemnation of the Phari&s;aical Jews, of whom Paul te&s;tifies, "That the children of I&s;|rael could not &s;teadfa&s;tly look to the end of that which is aboli&s;hed&mdash;but their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the &s;ame vail untaken away, in the reading of the Old Te&s;tament; which vail is done away in Chri&s;t." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii. 13, 14.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Concerning</HI> BAPTISM.</HEAD>
<P>CONCERNING Water Bapti&s;m, Francis Herr calls it a reception into the church and congre|gation of &s;aints, and that it ought not to be called a Chri&s;tian Bapti&s;m, if it is knowingly admini&s;tered un|to the unconverted. Again he &s;ays, it being then &s;pi|ritual, it requires al&s;o &s;piritual and regenerated men, who&s;e hearts were changed, &amp;c. "See! The&s;e has St. John baptized, and all &s;uch has Je&s;us Chri&s;t com|manded to baptize." If he means, that the admini|&s;tration of water is &s;piritual, I mu&s;t di&s;&s;ent from him therein, believing that &s;piritual and regenerated men have already experienced an efficacious and truly &s;pi|ritual Bapti&s;m, which changes the heart, and needs not the operation of any element; a reliance on which may &s;ubject to the &s;ame condemnation into which the Galatians fell, who "began in the Spirit, and thought to be made perfect in the fle&s;h." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 3.</NOTE> And if John the Bapti&s;t only baptized "&s;uch as were changed by the word of truth," &amp;c. then did he find a plentiful harve&s;t of converted men. For Matthew &s;ays, "Then went out to him Jeru&s;alem and all Ju|dea, and all the regions round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. iii. 5.</NOTE> Mark &s;ays&mdash; "And there went out unto him all the land of Ju|dea, and they of Jeru&s;alem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark i. 5.</NOTE> Very comprehen|&s;ive expre&s;&s;ions the&s;e. Even the Publicans and Sol|diers were not refu&s;ed by him: from which I infer, that tho&s;e whom John baptized were generally un|converted, &s;uch as needed repentance; and his mi&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="15" REF="022648_0013_0FB9C0C9296C9570">was to &s;hew them typically, by bathing or plung|ing into, and wa&s;hing their bodies clean in water, how Chri&s;t would by his Spirit wa&s;h, clean&s;e and pu|rify their hearts and con&s;ciences. And had tho&s;e al|ready mentioned been converted per&s;ons, they would have known Chri&s;t (as John did) when he came with his refining and winnowing Bapti&s;m, and not have rejected him.</P>
<P>But to come to the point in hand, he further &s;ays, "Such has Je&s;us Chri&s;t commanded to baptize, when he &s;aith, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth; go ye therefore and teach all nations, bap|tizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t," &amp;c. And again&mdash; "Go ye into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel unto every creature; he that believeth, and is bap|tized, &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believeth not, &s;hall be damned." Hence he would infer, that water is meant in the above commands; to which I an&s;wer, that God is a God of order; that Chri&s;t is not the author of confu&s;ion: if water had there been meant, would it not have been expre&s;&s;ed? With what pre|ci&s;ion were the rites of the law enjoined; and the di&s;|pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, which is far more excellent, cannot be le&s;s complete. The conte&s;ts and confu&s;i|on that have been about this &s;imple point, for many generations, have been almo&s;t endle&s;s. If therefore water was intended, the command appears to be de|ficient without the expre&s;&s;ion thereof; and can we admit, that &s;uch an omi&s;&s;ion e&s;caped him who is omni&s;cient? The end and de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's coming, was to lead men from exterior to interior things.&mdash; The new covenant, or go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, is &s;piri|tual, in which without him we can do nothing to ad|vance his glory. It is the &s;ub&s;tance of all that was prefigured under the law, which I conceive &s;tood in force until he had pa&s;&s;ed through it, and fulfilled
<PB N="16" REF="022648_0014_0FB9C0CA92D68280">the righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof. When on the cro&s;s, "Je|&s;us knowing that all things were accompli&s;hed, &s;aid I thir&s;t.&mdash;And when Je&s;us therefore had received the vinegar, he &s;aid, it is fini&s;hed." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xix. 28, 30.</NOTE> This I appre|hend to be the end of the typical di&s;pen&s;ation, which was accompli&s;hed and fini&s;hed in him; "for Chri&s;t is the end of the law." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 4.</NOTE> Yet notwith&s;tanding it was for a time kept to, and taught by the Apo&s;tles, it being rea&s;onable to conclude, that their continuance in the&s;e things was permitted, more through conde|&s;cen&s;ion to the attachments and frailty of human na|ture in general, than from &s;en&s;ible obligation; long fixed and deep rooted cu&s;toms and prejudices not be|ing readily &s;eparated from. For the &s;ame rea&s;ons do I apprehend John's Bapti&s;m was practi&s;ed at the fir&s;t under the go&s;pel for a time, by &s;ome who doubt|le&s;s &s;aw the invalidity thereof, and continued by others &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly. The Apo&s;tles having been bap|tized by John, &s;aw &s;uch evident te&s;timonies of the divine pre&s;ence attending his mi&s;&s;ion, that they in an unexperienced &s;tate, not &s;eeing clearly the de&s;ign and exit thereof, probably thought it to have great|er efficacy than they afterwards found, as appears from the &s;en&s;e of Peter and Paul, when in a more experienced period of their apo&s;tle&s;hip (viz.) "The like figure whereunto Bapti&s;m doth al&s;o now &s;ave us;" (mark, he profe&s;&s;es being &s;aved by Bapti&s;m) "not the putting away the filth of the fle&s;h," (which is the utmo&s;t effect of water) "but the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience towards God, by the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Peter iii. 21.</NOTE> He who experienceth this re&s;urrec|tion &s;piritually accompli&s;hed in him&s;elf, knows well what &s;aving Bapti&s;m is. Chri&s;t told Peter and his brethren, when bodily pre&s;ent, that when he the Spirit of Truth is come, he would guide them into
<PB N="17" REF="022648_0015_0FB9C0D09BDA18B0">all truth, which is a gradual work. They at that time thought their Ma&s;ter's intention was to re&s;tore a temporal kingdom unto I&s;rael; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts i. 6.</NOTE> he did not unde|ceive them, but left their judgment to be rectified in that, and many other things (which they could not then bear) by their promi&s;ed guide. Peter in his &s;piritual infancy practi&s;ed water Bapti&s;m, hav|ing quickly after his Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion, received a commi&s;&s;ion and power to preach the go&s;pel, and to work miracles, by which great numbers were convert|ed to the Chri&s;tian faith. Conver&s;ion and Spiritual Bapti&s;m are the &s;ame thing; for both imply a change from a &s;tate of nature into a &s;tate of grace; and that power by which he preached the go&s;pel mixing with, or being received in true faith by the hearers, bap|tized them with the Spirit and wrought their con|ver&s;ion; but many who heard and believed were not &s;o baptized, for want of faith. The above is verified in the in&s;tance of Cornelius. "While he yet &s;pake the&s;e words, the Holy Gho&s;t fell on all them which heard the word." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 44.</NOTE> The Apo&s;tles who had hitherto thought &s;alvation was confined to the Jews, were a&s;to|ni&s;hed becau&s;e the Spirit was conferred on the Gentiles al&s;o. This appears to be the eighth year from that miraculous effu&s;ion of the Spirit mentioned Acts 2d. It &s;eems on this occa&s;ion, as though &s;ome had began to doubt of water Bapti&s;m, or el&s;e why did Peter &s;ay, "Can any man forbid that water," &amp;c. Nine|teen years after this is the date of his epi&s;tle, in which he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf concerning Bapti&s;m; by which time we cannot doubt, but that his under&s;tand|ing and judgment was fully recti&s;ied, in that and all other things relative to &s;alvation.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle Paul, through who&s;e efficacious mi|ni&s;try multitudes of the Gentiles embraced the go&s;|pel,
<PB N="18" REF="022648_0016_0FB9C0D538B77478">in the 24th year of his apo&s;tle&s;hip, &s;ays, "I thank God, that I baptized none of you but Cri&s;pus and Gaius, le&s;t any &s;hould &s;ay, that I had baptized in mine own name." This by the context is doubtle&s;s generally under&s;tood of water Bapti&s;m. He then pro|ceeds, &s;aying, "And I baptized al&s;o the hou&s;ehold of Stephanas; be&s;ides I know not whether I baptized any other: for Chri&s;t &s;ent me not to baptize, but to preach the go&s;pel. The Apo&s;tle could not be ignorant of the command, "Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them," &amp;c. Had he under&s;tood water there to be meant, he mu&s;t have been very deficient in the execution of his mini&s;terial function, and al&s;o very pre&s;umptuous, to thank God that he had done his work &s;o negligently. It is highly probable, that ma|ny imagine the Apo&s;tle confined what he wrote hereon to the Corinthians; but the contrary is de|mon&s;trable, for Stephanas was an inhabitant of Achaia, and not of Corinth (now called Morea. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is the &s;outhernmo&s;t part of Greece, being a penin&s;ula al|mo&s;t cut off from the main by water, and lies neare&s;t to Achaia, they being joined by a narrow i&s;thmus of con&s;iderable length.</NOTE>) If he had been a Coriuthian, Paul's recommendation of him would have been unnece&s;&s;ary; from whence I argue, that tho&s;e enumerated were not only all the Corinthians that he had baptized with water, but all that he had &s;o baptized any where; but that the Spirit's Bapti&s;m had been through the go&s;|pel power conferred on many by him, is evident: for Luke who wrote the Acts, and was Paul's com|panion, &s;ays po&s;itively (when &s;peaking of Paul's la|bours) "And many of the Corinthians hearing, be|lieved and were baptized." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xviii. 8.</NOTE> And here F. Herr's query, re&s;pecting the twelve Ephe&s;ians (on whom the Bapti&s;m of the Spirit was conferred by the lay|ing
<PB N="19" REF="022648_0017_0FB9C0D696851F18">on of Paul's hands) whether he baptized them with water or no, may be an&s;wered; the text &s;ays they were baptized, but is &s;ilent re&s;pecting water. This being three years earlier than his epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, determines the point &s;o far in our fa|vour, that we may venture to &s;ay he did not bap|tize them with water. Is it any greater miracle or le&s;s po&s;&s;ible to confer the Spirit's Bapti&s;m, than to heal the &s;ick, re&s;tore the lame, ca&s;t out devils, and rai&s;e the dead? &s;urely no; with men they are all im|po&s;&s;ible, but with God all things are po&s;&s;ible. And there are many in&s;tances in Scripture, where men not only performed wonders, and things impo&s;&s;ible as men, through his power, but al&s;o where tho&s;e things are imputed to men as their acts. And Paul profe&s;&s;es a power to confer gifts of the Spirit, &s;aying, "I long to &s;ee you, that I may impart unto you &s;ome &s;piritual gift." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now that water Bapti&s;m was John's Bapti&s;m, is by all granted; and that he was the only officer di|vinely commi&s;&s;ioned to admini&s;ter it, is all that can be proved. That the Spirit's Bapti&s;m is Chri&s;t's Bap|ti&s;m, is equally true. But if water Bapti&s;m was al&s;o intended to be perpetuated as an ordinance of Chri&s;t, his entire &s;ilence re&s;pecting any command thereon, mu&s;t be very extraordinary. What did John mean when he &s;aid, "I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of who&s;e &s;hoes I am not worthy to unloo&s;e; he &s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t and with fire: who&s;e fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor," <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke iii. 16.17.</NOTE> &amp;c. What el&s;e does his de&s;cription of the purifying effects of Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m argue, but that in like manner as I wa&s;h, bathe, and purify your bo|dies in water, &s;o &s;hall he who cometh wa&s;h, clean&s;e,
<PB N="20" REF="022648_0018_0FB9C0D9769C6478">and purify your hearts and con&s;ciences, in his &s;pi|ritual laver? And what el&s;e did John mean, when he &s;aid, he mu&s;t increa&s;e, but I mu&s;t decrea&s;e, if it was not in the admini&s;tration of their different bapti&s;mal offices? In what other point of view can we under&s;tand it? &s;ince to increa&s;e implies a gradual &s;preading or prevailing, and to decrea&s;e a gradual diminution; and whatever continues to decrea&s;e will terminate. Again: that water is not Chri&s;t's Bap|ti&s;m, is clear to me on this head (viz.) as he came to fulfil, and al&s;o to abrogate and rend the vail of figurative performances (though originally of equal authority with water Baptim) in order to make way for an higher di&s;pen&s;ation; the &s;ub&s;tance of all that was typified by the ordinances under the law, "which made nothing perfect;" it would therefore be irra|tional to &s;uppo&s;e, that he who came after the power of an endle&s;s life, who by "the bringing in of a bet|ter hope," <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vii. 19, 16.</NOTE> &s;hould again devolve into &s;hadowy and exterior things. For Paul &s;aith, "Wherefore if ye be dead with Chri&s;t from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye &s;ubject to ordinances (touch not, ta&s;te not, handle not; which are all to peri&s;h with the u&s;ing) after the commandments and doctrines of men?" <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cell. ii. 20, 21, and 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>F. Herr calls on us to an&s;wer him from Holy Writ, where our Lord has given his di&s;ciples, &amp;c. power, or commanded them to baptize men with the Holy Gho&s;t; to which I an&s;wer, when he &s;aid, "All pow|er is given unto me in heaven and in earth." By this he a&s;&s;ured them, that his power was all-&s;uffici|ent, and &s;hould not be lacking: and "Go ye there|fore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Ho|ly Gho&s;t; teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what.
<PB N="21" REF="022648_0019_0FB9C0DCC8506718">&s;oever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world," is a po&s;itive command, with an a&s;&s;urance that his pre&s;ence &s;hould not fail them. Likewi&s;e, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Go&s;pel to every creature; he that believeth, and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believeth not," &amp;c. The&s;e two texts our author links together, and &s;o do I, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is evident, that the&s;e two texts were &s;poken at one time: Matthew &s;ays, "Behold he goeth before you into Galilee, there &s;hall ye &s;ee him." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matthew xxxviii 7, 6.</NOTE>&mdash;Then the eleven di&s;ciples went away into Galilee, &amp;c. Mark &s;ays, "Tell his di&s;ciples and Peter, that he goeth before you into Galilee, there &s;hall ye &s;ee him." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark xvi. 17.</NOTE> And the two Evangeli&s;ts only mention one interview with the eleven in con&s;equence of this direction; the fir&s;t &s;ays, &s;ome doubted; the latter, that he upbraided them with unbelief; and it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that they doubted or di&s;believed in his re&s;urrection, after they had &s;een him.</NOTE> &s;uppo&s;ing them both to have been written at one time. He &s;ays, this injunction the Apo&s;tles received, as the commandment of their Lord and Ma&s;ter, in which &s;en&s;e I al&s;o accept it, having no doubt but that the Bapti&s;m of the Spirit was hereby commanded and en|joined; for only to have enjoined plunging, dipping, and purifying their bodies in water, is a work that &s;inful men could perform without &s;upernatural aid, and needed not &s;uch a&s;&s;urance given of the never failing pre&s;ence of Almighty Power. And to me it &s;eems demon&s;trable, that Water was no more in|tended than expre&s;&s;ed, which I think may thus be proved: Our Lord po&s;itively &s;ays, "He that believ|eth, and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved." Here is no provi&s;o; he did not &s;ay, may be, but &s;hall be &s;av|ed; from whence I argue, the Bapti&s;m which our Lord commanded, is ab&s;olutely a &s;aving Bapti&s;m; and that if water was meant, the con&s;equence is in|evitably
<PB N="22" REF="022648_0020_0FB9C0DED1FE0C70">evitably the &s;ame; it mu&s;t follow, that all who have believed, and been baptized therewith, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, are &s;aved, Si|mon Magus not excepted, for he believed and was baptized. Are there any among the &s;ons of Adam &s;o replete with credulity as to believe, that water, however or by whom&s;oever admini&s;tered, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch &s;oul redeeming efficacy? &s;urely no; for it is a deplorable truth, that thou&s;ands, yea tens of thou|&s;ands, who have believed and been baptized in the manner de&s;cribed, have lived, and do live in all the gratifications of &s;en&s;uality; and many of them be|lieved not in the po&s;&s;ibility of their being delivered from them in this life, therefore far from a &s;tate of &s;alvation. If he that believeth, and is baptized (as our Lord commanded) &s;hall be &s;aved, then it was the Spirit's Bapti&s;m which he commanded his Apo|&s;tles to admini&s;ter, and not water.</P>
<P>Another touch&s;tone he has given for an infallible rule (viz.) Trees are known by their fruits; "By their fruits ye &s;hall know them;" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. vii. 20.</NOTE> which is applica|ble to men or things. He that is baptized with the Spirit, bringeth forth the fruits of the Spirit, which are "love, joy, peace, long-&s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, good|ne&s;s, faith, meekne&s;s, temperance; again&s;t &s;uch there is no law." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 22, 23.</NOTE> The fruits or works of the fle&s;h men|tioned in the three preceding ver&s;es, are, "Adul|tery, fornication, uncleanne&s;s, la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, idola|try, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, &s;trife, &s;editions, here&s;ies, envyings, murders, drun|kenne&s;s, revellings, and &s;uch like, of which I tell you, that they who do &s;uch things, &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 19, 20, 21.</NOTE> If therefore the fruits of many who have been baptized with water, be &s;uch as the fle&s;h bringeth forth, then are they not in a &s;tate of
<PB N="23" REF="022648_0021_0FB9C0F5513F96A0">&s;alvation. Again: if many who have believed, and been baptized with water, be not in a &s;tate of &s;al|vation, then is the Bapti&s;m wherewith they were bap|tized not the Bapti&s;m which Chri&s;t commanded.</P>
<P>If the fir&s;t be true, that the Bapti&s;m which Chri&s;t commanded be ab&s;olutely a &s;aving Bapti&s;m, then is the la&s;t al&s;o true, that Water Bapti&s;m is not the Bap|ti&s;m which he commanded and enjoined, becau&s;e it ab&s;olutely is not a &s;aving Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>A Bapti&s;m therefore, that cannot &s;ave or redeem men from their &s;ins, puts them in no better condi|tion than they would be in if there was no Bapti&s;m at all, &s;ince it neither makes men more holy nor le&s;s wicked: it is refuted by its own con&s;equences; and like circumci&s;ion or uncircumci&s;ion, it availeth nothing. And as to the capacity of Chri&s;t's Mini|&s;ters, in the admini&s;tration of Spiritual Bapti&s;m, he told his Apo&s;tles, that John truly baptized them with water, but they &s;hould be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t, not many days hence; (here he repre&s;ents John as the di&s;pen&s;er of water, and a&s;&s;umes no part of his mi&s;&s;ion to him&s;elf) which promi&s;e was ful&s;illed in the days of Penteco&s;t, when they were all filled with the Holy Gho&s;t. From which it appears, that to be filled with the Holy Spirit, or to have it con|ferred, and to be baptized therewith, are the &s;ame things. Wherefore I argue, that the Apo&s;tles did confer the Holy Gho&s;t, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts viii. 17.</NOTE> by the laying on of their hands; which when Simon Magus &s;aw, he offer|ed them money, thinking to make gain thereby: al&s;o the twelve on whom Paul laid his hands here|tofore mentioned. Marvel not at the&s;e things, for Chri&s;t's Spirit is the Chri&s;tian's &s;trength, which Paul experienced when he &s;aid, "I can do all things through Chri&s;t which &s;trengtheneth me," <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phil. iv. 13.</NOTE> and as
<PB N="24" REF="022648_0022_0FB9C0E71ED4BB10">before hinted, declared this &s;ufficiency to be of God, who had made them able Mini&s;ters of the Spirit, and not of the letter; therefore he that mini&s;tereth the Spirit, conferreth the Spirit; and he that conferreth the Spirit, baptizeth with the Spirit. Chri&s;t &s;aid, "Without me ye can do nothing," but through him they could do all things. Without him it was, and is equally impo&s;&s;ible for them, or any now, to preach the go&s;pel ("which is the power of God unto &s;alva|tion" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 16.</NOTE>) to the edification of the church and God's glory; therefore whoever attempts to officiate as a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, without being &s;en&s;ibly called of God, and on every &s;uch occa&s;ion renewedly quali&s;ied and put forth by the aid of his power, experiencing his Spirit to give utterance as the Apo&s;tles did, cannot profit the people; for he who dependeth on the Scrip|tures only for doctrine, and not on the Spirit, is a mi|ni&s;ter of the letter, and not of the Spirit: &s;uch were they who taught for doctrine the precepts of men; and he that hath "not the Spirit of Chri&s;t is none of his;" <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 9.</NOTE> and he who abideth not in the doctrine of Chri&s;t, cannot be his Mini&s;ter, however eloquent or coherent his doctrines may be: therefore, whatever &s;uch do in that line, it being without him, is pre|&s;umption and wor&s;e than nothing.</P>
<P>The above may be con&s;idered as a digre&s;&s;ion, but as it tends to elucidate the &s;ubject under notice, I have in&s;erted it; apprehending that I have been en|abled, in a good degree, to demon&s;trate that Chri&s;t has not only commanded, but al&s;o given power to his Di&s;ciples and Apo&s;tles to admini&s;ter the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Spirit; and I may add, not unto them on|ly who heard him utter the command, but to all that &s;hould go forth in his name to the end of the world.</P>
<P>F. Herr tells us of Water Bapti&s;m being a proof or &s;eal of regeneration. This is transferring it from
<PB N="25" REF="022648_0023_0FB9C0E8995F8778">being a type of good things to come, to be an en&s;ign or evidence that they are come; but as it leaves no vi&s;ible nor di&s;tingui&s;hable mark or impre&s;&s;ion on the body, nor makes any material change, &s;o as to pro|duce different fruits; and the idea being without foun|dation in rea&s;on, or precept from Holy Writ, it may be rejected as being merely imaginary in its effects, and de&s;titute of any real con&s;equence; therefore, with other legal rites, it may now be deemed but a u&s;ele&s;s ordinance. The be&s;t &s;eal or proof of having been regenerated, are the fruits of the Spirit heretofore mentioned, which are unto holine&s;s, and the end ever|la&s;ting life. And if any want a di&s;tingui&s;hable badge of being Members of Chri&s;t's Church, Love is the cri|terion which he propo&s;ed for that end, &s;aying, "By this &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye have love one to another." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xiii. 35.</NOTE></P>
<P>We are charged by F. Herr with in&s;inuating, that Water Bapti&s;m was derived from the law, and he calls on us to prove where it began. In the fir&s;t place it will be right to define what is Water Bapti&s;m; is it not to dip, plunge, bathe, or wa&s;h, &s;o as to clean&s;e the body? or as Peter hath it, to put away the filth of the fle&s;h? This I take to be what properly con|&s;titutes Water Bapti&s;m, when performed on a religi|ous account; any words or ceremony uttered during the operation, does not make it more or le&s;s &s;o. We do not find that John the Bapti&s;t had any fixed ce|remony, except it was to preach the doctrine of re|pentance; therefore, if to wa&s;h, clean&s;e, and purify the body, be what properly con&s;titutes Water Bap|ti&s;m, in the original &s;en&s;e of the word, then was Wa|ter Bapti&s;m often on religious accounts practi&s;ed by the I&s;raelites under the law. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Levit. xv. from ver&s;e 5th to 27th&mdash;and Num. xix. from 8th to 21&s;t.</NOTE> But we do not &s;ay that
<PB N="26" REF="022648_0024_0FB9C0EA2DC2A150">John derived his commi&s;&s;ion from the law, but im|mediately from heaven: yet if John's Bapti&s;m had not had a near affinity with the wa&s;hings and purifi|cations common among the Jews (which in fact were Bapti&s;ms) it is highly probable it would not have found &s;uch univer&s;al reception among&s;t that people, who were very tenacious of the cu&s;toms delivered by Mo&s;es. This was abundantly verified; for when Chri&s;t came, who had greater te&s;timony than John, his doctrine &s;o contradicted their prejudices, that they almo&s;t univer&s;ally rejected and di&s;owned him.</P>
<P>The following are quotations from the works of I&s;aac Pennington, a worthy member of our &s;ociety, who lived in the la&s;t century, and had experienced both elementary and Spiritual Bapti&s;m. He &s;ays, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IId Vol. Page 417.</NOTE> "It is &s;aid, go teach baptizing, but it is not &s;aid baptizing with water, but in the name, or rather (as the Greek is) into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>"Now to baptize with water is one thing, and to baptize into the name is another; as they who experience the Spiritual Bapti&s;m know it to be: for the word of faith turns men from Satan to the pow|er of life; and then as they receive the power, and are made partakers of the power, they are baptized into the power and virtue of life; and &s;o they are buried (&s;o far as they come into Chri&s;t) by the pow|er of his Spirit, into this Heavenly Bapti&s;m, into death unto &s;in, and by the &s;ame power are made alive unto righteou&s;ne&s;s; and &s;o the name of the Lord, the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, comes over them, and they ri&s;e up in it unto life and righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o are dead unto &s;in, and alive unto God. Now any outward circumci&s;ing or wa&s;hing, can be but a figure of this; but the inward circumci&s;ing and

It was in the gloomy aeras of apo&s;tacy, that Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, became the primary qualifica|tions of men inducted into the mini&s;terial office, with|out which none could otherwi&s;e be admitted.

And the&s;e being redeemed from the cor|ruptions
<PB N="39" REF="022648_0037_0FB9C111D7421618">ruptions of nature, and from the maxims, friend&s;hip, and &s;pirit of the world, and being crucified to the world, and the world unto them, having put off the old man with his deeds, their affections are &s;et on things above; counting all things as dro&s;s, and as dung, that they may win Chri&s;t. Being guided and governed by his Spirit, which breathes peace on earth, and good will to men, they cannot lift up a &s;word, nor any carnal weapon again&s;t any man, be|ing well per&s;uaded, that the nature and de&s;ign of the go&s;pel &s;pirit is to &s;ave mens' lives, and not to de&s;troy them: the ground of wars and fighting, which &s;tands in the natural and fallen e&s;tate, being taken away, they can love their enemies, and tho&s;e who de&s;pitefully u&s;e and per&s;ecute them: they feel great compa&s;&s;ion and love to flow towards them; and their prayers often mentally, and &s;ometimes vocally a&s;cend to the God of the Spirits of all fle&s;h, that he may ha&s;ten his &s;acred purpo&s;es, and cau&s;e the glo|rious light of the go&s;pel more eminently to be di&s;|played, and to break forth on the right hand, and on the left, that the mountain of the Lord's hou&s;e may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the top of the mountains, that all nations may flow unto it, that they may beat their &s;words into plow &s;hares, and learn war no more.</P>
<P>And every man and woman, who through grace comes to experience this glorious tran&s;lation out of darkne&s;s into the light of the Lord, enjoys internally the privileges which the go&s;pel and government of the Prince of Peace promi&s;eth; for "eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> But outwardly the&s;e are often abridged in their privileges, and per&s;ecuted by the men of this world, becau&s;e the life of a follow|er

Tribulations are attendant on the go&s;pel; and he "that will live godly in this world mu&s;t &s;uffer per&s;ecution." This has been the lot and portion of the followers of Chri&s;t through many generations, and will doubtle&s;s, in a greater or le&s;&s;er degree, continue to be &s;o, until by a more ge|neral effu&s;ion of go&s;pel light, that prophecy be ful|filled (viz.) "He will de&s;troy in this mountain, the face of the covering ca&s;t over all people, and the vail that is &s;pread over all nations, and he will &s;wallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces, and the rebuke of his people &s;hall he take away from off all the earth." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xxv. 7, 8.</NOTE> What is this mountain which the Prophet frequently mentions, but the profe&s;&s;ion of the truth &s;ub&s;tanti|ally experienced, and not literally held in an impure con&s;cience, which &s;hall ri&s;e above the mountains and hills of empty and lifele&s;s profe&s;&s;ion?

What is the rebuke of his peo|ple, but the rod of per&s;ecution which hath &s;tained the hi&s;tory of many generations?&mdash;And what is the death that &s;hall be &s;wallowed up in victory, but dead and un&s;ub&s;tantial forms, and a profe&s;&s;ion of the truth held in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s? that brings not to the know|ledge of the only true God, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent, whom to know is life eternal.

But as the declen&s;ion from primitive go&s;pel righteou&s;ne&s;s was gradual, &s;o may we expect the return thereof the be, and &s;o hath it been for &s;everal centuries; there has been a breaking forth of light in pious men, who according to the degrees of it manife&s;ted to them, were faithful and valiant in oppo&s;ing the &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry of the Romi&s;h Church, for which they endured a great fight of afflictions, and many fini&s;h|ed their cour&s;e in the flames; and in the generations &s;ucceeding, down to the pre&s;ent time, light has in|crea&s;ed and ri&s;en higher and higher, in&s;omuch that the &s;pirit of per&s;ecution in &s;everal nations is held in abhorrence; and as this divine principle of light and grace is admitted to operate, it will di&s;&s;eminate and &s;pread into the dark corners of the earth, and by its efficacy penetrate through the covering, and rend the vail of prejudices and unbelief, whereby the hidden things of darkne&s;s will be manife&s;ted, and that bu&s;y, active part in man, which has had the pre-eminence &s;ince the Apo&s;tle's days in preaching, praying, &s;ing|ing, and a round of exteriors, will be &s;een to be the fir&s;t nature, exerci&s;ed in a fruitle&s;s toil.</P>
<P>We have rea&s;on to believe, that in the coming and &s;preading of this peaceable government, that pro|phecy will be as plentifully verified, as in the fir&s;t ages of the go&s;pel (viz. "And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s afterwards, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all fle&s;h, and your &s;ons and your daughters &s;hall pro|phecy, and your old men &s;hall dream dreams, and your young men &s;hall &s;ee vi&s;ions; and al&s;o upon the &s;ervants, and upon the handmaids in tho&s;e days, will

<P>If therefore the Lord's hand be not &s;hortened, nor his ear heavy; if there be no variablene&s;s nor &s;hadow of turning in him; and if it be iniquity that &s;epa|rates between the people and their God, and &s;in that hides his face from them, then in repenting and returning unto him, with full purpo&s;e of heart, he will return unto them; for "the Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing will he with hold from them that walk uprightly." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxxiv. 11.</NOTE> If &s;o, then doubt|le&s;s his church and people, as they adhere to his in|&s;peaking word, will be repleni&s;hed with all nece&s;&s;ary gifts for edification, for building one another up in the faith, for the promulgation of righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, for the propagation of the go&s;pel among the Heathens, in order that the bow, and the &s;word, and the battle may be broke out of the earth, and the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t, that he may reign for ever and ever.</P>
<P>In treating on this &s;ubject, I have not hitherto taken any notice of my opponent; what he has wrote thereon appearing to militate but little again&s;t us, ex|cept in two ca&s;es. In &s;peaking of the peaceable con|&s;titution of Chri&s;t's kingdom, wherein he &s;eems to approve our conduct and &s;entiments re&s;pecting war, he queries of us where war is more &s;trictly forbid than going to law&mdash;charging us with making u&s;e of the law as much as any other people, wherein I am &s;atisfied he is mi&s;taken, as our religious &s;ociety, from its fir&s;t ri&s;e, has manife&s;ted a great concern to di&s;courage contentious and litigious di&s;po&s;itions, and as

But if either of the &s;aid par|ties refu&s;e &s;uch advice or endeavours, they are to be complained of to the monthly meeting; of which com|plaint he or &s;he is to be notified, and reque&s;ted to attend; and the parties are there at liberty, or rather advi&s;ed to nominate as before, and the meeting may add one or more, if the occa&s;ion appears to require it; but if the parties refu&s;e to attend, and to nominate, then the meeting is to appoint a &s;ufficient number of Friends to hear and determine the &s;ame, as &s;pee|dily as the nature of the ca&s;e will admit.

<P>Now having in this e&s;&s;ay (though not minutely particular taken notice of the mo&s;t material parts of F.

I &s;hould not have &s;uppo&s;ed it improbable, if he had repre&s;ented him really, rather than figuritively &s;o; and that it con&s;i&s;ts abundantly more with the long-&s;uffer|ing of a gracious and merciful God, previous to the building of the ark, to command Noah to preach repentance to the depraved Antideluvians, and to forewarn them of the impending judgment, except they repented of their wickedne&s;s, than to cau&s;e the flood of waters to de&s;troy them without &s;uch warn|ing; in which ca&s;e he would really be a Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.
