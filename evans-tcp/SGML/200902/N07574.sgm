<HEAD>A NARRATIVE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THESE <HI>Indians</HI> were the Remains of a Tribe of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> &s;ettled at <HI>Cone&s;togoe,</HI> and thence called <HI>Cone&s;togoe Indians.</HI> On the fir&s;t Arrival of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> Me&s;&s;engers from this Tribe came to welcome them, with Pre&s;ents of Veni&s;on, Corn and Skins; and the whole Tribe entered into a Treaty of Friend&s;hip with the fir&s;t Proprietor, WILLIAM PENN, which was to la&s;t <Q>as long as the Sun &s;hould &s;hine, or the Waters run in the Rivers.</Q></P>
<P>This Treaty has been &s;ince frequently renewed, and the <HI>Chain brightened,</HI> as they expre&s;s it, from time to time. It has never been violated, on their Part or ours, till now. As their Lands by De|grees were mo&s;tly purcha&s;ed, and the Settlements of the White People began to &s;urround them, the Proprietor a&s;&s;igned them Lands on the Manor of <HI>Cone&s;togoe,</HI> which they might not part with; there they have lived many Years in Friend&s;hip with their White Neighbours, who loved them for their peaceable inoffen&s;ive Behaviour.</P>
<P>It has always been ob&s;erved that <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;et|tled in the Neighbourhood of White People, do not increa&s;e, but dimini&s;h continually. This
<PB N="4" REF="009667_0004_0F7CE23247ACB8C0">
Tribe accordingly went on dimini&s;hing, till there remained in their Town on the Manor, but 20 Per&s;ons, <HI>viz.</HI> 7 Men, 5 Women, and 8 Chil|dren, Boys and Girls.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, <HI>Shehaes</HI> was a very old Man, having a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the &s;econd Treaty held with them, by Mr. PENN, in 1701, and ever &s;ince continued a faithful and affectionate Friend to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> he is &s;aid to have been an exceeding good Man, con&s;idering his Education, being naturally of a mo&s;t kind benevolent Temper.</P>
<P><HI>Peggy</HI> was <HI>Shehaes</HI>'s Daughter; &s;he worked for her aged Father, continuing to live with him, though married, and attended him with filial Duty and Tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> was another good old Man; his Son <HI>Harry</HI> helped to &s;upport him.</P>
<P><HI>George</HI> and <HI>Will Soc</HI> were two Brothers, both young Men.</P>
<P><HI>John Smith,</HI> a valuable young Man, of the <HI>Cayuga</HI> Nation, who became acquainted with <HI>Peggy, Shehaes</HI>'s Daughter, &s;ome few Years &s;ince, married her, and &s;ettled in that Family. They had one Child, about three Years old.</P>
<P><HI>Betty,</HI> a harmle&s;s old Woman; and her Son <HI>Peter,</HI> a likely young Lad.</P>
<P><HI>Sally,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Name was <HI>Wyanjoy,</HI> a Woman much e&s;teemed by all that knew her, for her prudent and good Behaviour in &s;ome ve|ry trying Situations of Life. She was a truly good and an amiable Woman, had no Children of her own, but a di&s;tant Relation dying; &s;he had taken a Child of that Relation's, to bring up
<PB N="5" REF="009667_0005_0F7CE2331B1F4878">
as her own, and performed towards it all the Duties of an affectionate Parent.</P>
<P>The Reader will ob&s;erve, that many of their Names are <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> It is common with the <HI>In|dians</HI> that have an Affection for the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to give them&s;elves, and their Children, the Names of &s;uch <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Per&s;ons as they particularly e&s;teem.</P>
<P>This little Society continued the Cu&s;tom they had begun, when more numerous, of addre&s;&s;ing every new Governor, and every De&s;cendant of the fir&s;t Proprietor, welcoming him to the Pro|vince, a&s;&s;uring him of their Fidelity, and praying a Continuance of that Favour and Protection they had hitherto experienced. They had accordingly &s;ent up an Addre&s;s of this Kind to our pre&s;ent Governor, on his Arrival; but the &s;ame was &s;carce delivered, when the unfortunate Cata&s;tro|phe happened, which we are about to relate.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the 14th of <HI>December,</HI> 1763, Fifty-&s;even Men, from &s;ome of our Frontier Town&s;hips, who had projected the De&s;truction of this little Common-wealth, came, all well-mounted, and armed with Firelocks, Hangers and Hatchets, having travelled through the Coun|try in the Night, to <HI>Cone&s;togoe</HI> Manor. There they &s;urrounded the &s;mall Village of <HI>Indian</HI> Huts, and ju&s;t at Break of Day broke into them all at once. Only three Men, two Women, and a young Boy, were found at home, the re&s;t being out among the neighbouring White People, &s;ome to &s;ell the Ba&s;kets, Brooms and Bowls they ma|nufactured, and others on other Occa&s;ions. The&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="009667_0006_0F7CE233CACD55C8">
poor defencele&s;s Creatures were immediately fired upon, &s;tabbed and hatcheted to Death! The good <HI>Shehaes,</HI> among the re&s;t, cut to Pieces in his Bed. All of them were &s;calped, and otherwi&s;e horri|bly mangled. Then their Huts were &s;et on Fire, and mo&s;t of them burnt down. When the Troop, plea&s;ed with their own Conduct and Bra|very, but enraged that any of the poor <HI>Indians</HI> had e&s;caped the Ma&s;&s;acre, rode off, and in &s;mall Parties, by different Roads, went home.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al Concern of the neighbouring White People on hearing of this Event, and the Lamentations of the younger <HI>Indians,</HI> when they returned and &s;aw the De&s;olation, and the but|chered half-burnt Bodies of their murdered Pa|rents, and other Relations, cannot well be ex|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Magi&s;trates of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> &s;ent out to collect the remaining <HI>Indians,</HI> brought them into the Town for their better Security again&s;t any farther Attempt; and it is &s;aid condoled with them on the Misfortune that had happened, took them by the Hand, comforted and <HI>promi&s;ed them Protec|tion.</HI>&mdash;They were all put into the Workhou&s;e, a &s;trong Building, as the Place of greate&s;t Safety.</P>

<P>There are &s;ome (I am a&s;hamed to hear it) who would extenuate the enormous Wickedne&s;s of the&s;e Actions, by &s;aying, <Q>The Inhabitants of the Frontiers are exa&s;perated with the Murder of their Relations, by the Enemy <HI>Indians,</HI> in the pre&s;ent War.</Q> It is po&s;&s;ible;&mdash;but though this might ju&s;tify their going out into the Woods, to &s;eek for tho&s;e Enemies, and avenge upon them tho&s;e Murders; it can never ju&s;tify their turning in to the Heart of the Country, to murder their Friends.</P>

<P>HOMER wrote his Poem, called the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> &s;ome Hundred Years before the Birth of Chri&s;t.

The Rites of Ho&s;pitality were called <HI>&s;acred,</HI> becau&s;e the Stranger, the Poor and the Weak, when they applied for Protection and Relief, were, from the Religion of tho&s;e Times, &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ent by the Deity to try the Goodne&s;s of Men, and that he would avenge the Injuries they might receive, where they ought to have been protected.&mdash; The&s;e Sentiments therefore influenced the Man|ners of all Ranks of People, even the meane&s;t; for we find that when <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> came, as a poor Stranger, to the Hut of <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> the Swineherd, and his great Dogs ran out to tear the ragged Man, <HI>Eumaeus</HI> drave them away with Stones; and

<P>Thus much for the Sentiments of the ancient <HI>Heathens.</HI>&mdash;As for the <HI>Turks,</HI> it is recorded in the Life of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> the Founder of their Reli|ligion, That <HI>Khaled,</HI> one of his Captains, having
<PB N="17" REF="009667_0017_0F7CE23F7351F080">
divided a Number of Pri&s;oners between him&s;elf and tho&s;e that were with him, he commanded the Hands of his own Pri&s;oners to be tied behind them, and then, in a mo&s;t cruel and brutal Man|ner, put them to the Sword; but he could not prevail on his Men to ma&s;&s;acre <HI>their</HI> Captives, be|cau&s;e in Fight they had laid down their Arms, &s;ubmitted, and demanded Protection. <HI>Mahomet,</HI> when the Account was brought to him, applauded the Men for their Humanity; but &s;aid to <HI>Khaled,</HI> with great Indignation, <HI>Oh</HI> Khaled, <HI>thou Butcher; cea&s;e to mole&s;t me with thy Wickedne&s;s.&mdash;If thou po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed&s;t a Heap of Gold as large in Mount</HI> Obod, <HI>and &s;hould&s;t expend it all in God's Cau&s;e, thy Merit would not efface the Guilt incurred by the Murder of the meane&s;t of tho&s;e poor Captives.</HI></P>
<P>Among the <HI>Arabs</HI> or <HI>Saracens,</HI> though it was lawful to put to Death a Pri&s;oner taken in Battle, if he had made him&s;elf obnoxious by his former Wickedne&s;s, yet this could not be done after he had once eaten Bread, or drank Water, while in their Hands. Hence we read in the Hi&s;tory of the Wars of the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> that when the <HI>Franks</HI> had &s;uffered a great Defeat from <HI>Saladin,</HI> and among the Pri&s;oners were the King of <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> and <HI>Arnold,</HI> a famous Chri&s;tian Captain, who had been very cruel to the <HI>Saracens;</HI> the&s;e two being brought before the Soltan, he placed the King on his right Hand, and <HI>Arnold</HI> on his left; and then pre&s;ented the King with a Cup of Wa|ter, who immediately drank to <HI>Arnold;</HI> but when <HI>Arnold</HI> was about to receive the Cup, the Soltan interrupted, &s;aying, <HI>I will not &s;uffer this wicked

In 1746, when we were hot War with <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> Captain <HI>William Ed|wards,</HI> coming through the Gulph from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> richly laden, met with a mo&s;t violent Storm, in which the Ship &s;prung a Leak, that obliged them, for the Saving of their Lives, to run her into the <HI>Havannah.</HI> The Captain went on Shore, directly waited on the Governor, told the Occa&s;ion of his putting in, and that he &s;urrendered his Ship as a Prize, and him&s;elf and his Men as Pri&s;oners of War, only reque&s;ting good Quarter. <HI>No, Sir,</HI> replied the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governor, <HI>If we had taken you in fair War at Sea, or approaching our Coa&s;t with ho&s;tile Intentions, your Ship would then have been a Prize, and your People Pri&s;oners. But when di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed by a Tempe&s;t, you come into our Ports for the Safety of your Lives, we, though Enemies, being

You have Leave therefore to unload your Ship, if that be nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;top the Leak; you may refit here, and traffick &s;o far as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to pay the Charges; you may then de|part, and I will give you a Pa&s;s, to be in Force till you are beyond</HI> Bermuda. <HI>If after that you are ta|ken, you will then be a Prize, but now you are only a Stranger, and have a Stranger's Right to Safety and Protection.</HI>&mdash;The Ship accordingly de|parted, and arrived &s;afe in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Will it be permitted me to adduce, on this Occa&s;ion, an In&s;tance of the like Honour in a poor unenlightened <HI>African Negroe.</HI> I find it in Capt. <HI>Seagrave</HI>'s Account of his Voyage to <HI>Guinea.</HI> He relates that a <HI>New-England</HI> Sloop, trading there in 1752, left their &s;econd Mate, <HI>William Murray,</HI> &s;ick on Shore, and &s;ailed without him. <HI>Murray</HI> was at the Hou&s;e of a Black, name <HI>Cud|joe,</HI> with whom he had contracted an Acquaint|ance during their Trade. He recovered, and the Sloop being gone, he continued with his black Friend, till &s;ome other Opportunity &s;hould offer of his getting home. In the mean while, a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship came into the Road, and &s;ome of the Blacks going on board her, were treacherou&s;ly &s;eized, and carried off as Slaves. Their Relations and Friends, tran&s;ported with &s;udden Rage, ran to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Cudjoe</HI> to take Revenge, by killing <HI>Murray.

Tho&s;e whom you have di&s;armed to &s;atisfy groundle&s;s Su&s;picions, will you leave them expo&s;ed to the armed Madmen of your Country?&mdash;Unmanly Men! who are not a&s;hamed to come with Weapons again&s;t the Un|armed, to u&s;e the Sword again&s;t Women, and the Bayonet again&s;t young Children; and who have already given &s;uch bloody Proofs of their Inhumanity and Cruelty.&mdash;Let us rouze our|&s;elves, for Shame, and redeem the Honour of our Province from the Contempt of its Neighbours; let all good Men join heartily and unanimou&s;ly in Support of the Laws, and in &s;trengthening the Hands of Government; that JUSTICE may be done, the Wicked puni&s;hed, and the Innocent protected; otherwi&s;e we can, as a People, expect no Ble&s;&s;ing from Heaven, there will be no Security for our Per&s;ons or Pro|perties; Anarchy and Confu&s;ion will prevail over all, and Violence, without Judgment, di&s;po&s;e of every Thing.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="009667_0030_0F7CE24BCB09A730">When I mention the Ba&s;ene&s;s of the Murder|ers, in the U&s;e they made of Arms, I cannot, I ought not to forget, the very different Behaviour of <HI>brave Men</HI> and <HI>true Soldiers,</HI> of which this melancholy Occa&s;ion has afforded us fre&s;h In&s;tan|ces. The <HI>Royal Highlanders</HI> have, in the Cour&s;e of this War, &s;uffered as much as any other Corps, and have frequently had their Ranks thinn'd by an <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy; yet they did not for this retain a brutal undi&s;tingui&s;hing Re&s;entment again&s;t <HI>all Indians,</HI> Friends as well as Foes. But a Compa|ny of them happening to be here, when the 140 poor <HI>Indians</HI> above mentioned were thought in too much Danger to &s;tay longer in the Province, chearfully undertook to protect and e&s;cort them to <HI>NeW-York,</HI> which they executed (as far as that Government would permit the <HI>Indians</HI> to come) with Fidelity and Honour; and their Cap|tain <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> is ju&s;tly applauded and honoured by all &s;en&s;ible and good People, for the Care, Tenderne&s;s and Humanity, with which he treat|ed tho&s;e unhappy Fugitives, during their March in this &s;evere Sea&s;on. General <HI>Gage,</HI> too, has approved of his Officer's Conduct, and, as I hear, ordered him to remain with the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Amboy,</HI> and continue his Protection to them, till another Body of the King's Forces could be &s;ent to relieve his Company, and e&s;cort their Charge back in Safety to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where his Excellency has had the Goodne&s;s to direct tho&s;e Forces to remain for &s;ome Time, under the Orders of our Gover|nor, for the Security of the <HI>Indians;</HI> the Troops of this Province being at pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;arily po&s;ted

on the Frontier. Such ju&s;t and generous Actions endear the Military to the Civil Power, and im|pre&s;s the Minds of all the Di&s;cerning with a &s;till greater Re&s;pect for our national Government.&mdash; I &s;hall conclude with ob&s;erving, that <HI>Cowards</HI> can handle Arms, can &s;trike where they are &s;ure to meet with no Return, can wound, mangle and murder; but it belongs to <HI>brave</HI> Men to &s;pare, and to protect; for, as the Poet &s;ays,
