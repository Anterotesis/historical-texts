<P>VERY &s;triking and remarkable is the Charge and Exhortation of the great God to the Prophet I&s;aiah. <HI>Cry aloud, &s;pare not, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, and &s;hew my people their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and the hou&s;e of Jacob their &s;ins.</HI> From this and many other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;acred writ, it ap|pears to be the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of God's mini&s;ters to bear a faithful te&s;timony again&s;t all the &s;ins, and e&s;peci|ally the crying abominations that prevail among&s;t the people to whom they are &s;ent. The great Judge of all

the earth, who determines the fate of all its inhabitants, enjoyns this important and irk&s;ome duty upon the Pro|phet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> in the beginning of the chapter, of which our text is a part: he commands him to reprove Jeru&s;a|lem for all her attrocious crimes and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and to denounce his judgments again&s;t them. The&s;e are the words of the incen&s;ed Jehovah to the Prophet. <HI>Now thou &s;on of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody City: Yea, thou &s;halt &s;hew her all her abominations.</HI> What were the&s;e abominations? The &s;ub&s;equent ver&s;es declare&mdash; They were murder, idolatry, di&s;obedience to Parents, oppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;tranger, the widow, and the orphan&mdash; contempt of things &s;acred, prophanation of the Sabbath, &s;lander to promote the &s;hedding of blood, lewdne&s;s, and that of the wor&s;t kind; ince&s;t and adultery. The&s;e were the enormous crimes, for which God vehemently re|proves the Jews, by the mouth of his Prophet&mdash;crimes at which an unfear'd con&s;cience &s;hudders and recoils&mdash; Crimes, for which the flaming wrath of heaven cometh down on the children of di&s;obedience. Yet the&s;e crimes all black as they were, and &s;ufficient to plunge a nation into ruin, were but a part of <HI>Jeru&s;alem's</HI> guilt; for &s;in is prolific, and one vice breeds another. Therefore God &s;ubjoins to the dark li&s;t of the abovementioned &s;ins, tho&s;e of bribery, u&s;ury, and corruption. In thee &s;ays he have they taken gifts to &s;hed blood&mdash;thou ha&s;t taken u&s;ury and increa&s;e: And then he upbraids them with EXTORTION

in the words of my text, &s;aying, <HI>And thou ha&s;t greedily gained of thy neighbours by</HI> Extortion.</P>
<P>THIS grievous, crying &s;in, which God formerly char|ged on his ancient people, by the mouth of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> he now charges on the inhabitants of the&s;e American States, &s;aying unto them, <HI>Ye have greedily gained of your neighbors,</HI> your poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed neighbours, <HI>by</HI> EXTORTION. As this SIN prevails among&s;t us with &s;uch an high hand, I &s;hould be utterly inexcu&s;able before God, and unfaithful to my country, and to the &s;ouls of men, if I did not bear my te&s;timony again&s;t an evil &s;o de&s;tructive and &s;o enormous.</P>

<P N="1">I. THEN I am to &s;hew you the nature of this &s;in.</P>
<P>THE word EXTORTION, is derived from the latin verb <HI>Extorqueo,</HI> which &s;ignifies to force, twi&s;t, or wring any thing from another; and it is that &s;in, whereby a per&s;on who has any thing to &s;ell, taking the advantage of his neighbour's nece&s;&s;ity, requires more for it than a rea&s;ona|ble price. If you &s;hould a&s;k me, what is a rea&s;onable price? I an&s;wer, it is &s;uch a one as is limited by tho&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="015859_0005_0F9A2F86D15DD0E8">
important commandments of loving our neighbor as our &s;elves, and doing to others as we would they &s;hould do unto us&mdash;&s;uch as is con&s;i&s;tent with the law of univer&s;al benevolence, charity to the poor, compa&s;&s;ion to the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed, and regard to the public intere&s;t of our country&mdash; Such a price as doth not exceed the former cu&s;tomary profits of hone&s;t men, nor the bounds and regulations fixed by our own delegated authority: in one word, &s;uch a price as is con&s;i&s;tent with the various duties incumbent upon us as chri&s;tians, as members of &s;ociety, and as friends to LIBERTY. Every man's con&s;cience, if he im|partially con&s;ults it, and has due re&s;pect to the&s;e points, will readily dictate to him what is a rea&s;onable price for his goods; now what exceeds this is EXTORTION, and the greater the exce&s;s is, the greater is the EXTORTION.</P>
<P>THIS vice is &s;ometimes in &s;cripture &s;tyled oppre&s;|&s;ion, as it is one &s;ubject's oppre&s;&s;ing another. Thus the I&s;raelites when they bought and &s;old, were commanded <HI>not to oppre&s;s one another, Lev.</HI> 25.14. But oppre&s;&s;ion is often di&s;tingui&s;hed from EXTORTION, as the one is gene|rally a &s;in of the governors, and the other a &s;in of the people. Thus the &s;in of oppre&s;&s;ion in its appropriated &s;en&s;e, con&s;i&s;ts in a magi&s;trate's laying heavy and unnece&s;|&s;ary taxes, fines, and other impo&s;itions upon the people, unju&s;tly &s;eizing their property, and impri&s;oning their per|&s;ons&mdash;witholding ju&s;tice from them, rejecting their rea|&s;onable
<PB N="7" REF="015859_0006_0F9A2F87904BC4A8">
petitions, abridging or taking away their lawful privileges, or making unju&s;t war upon them. EXTORTION &s;eems rather limited to the actions of tho&s;e under autho|rity, and is exerci&s;ed in tho&s;e private advantages which men take in their common dealings with one another, and e&s;pecially in ca&s;es of buying and &s;elling. It would be ea&s;y to prove and illu&s;trate the&s;e definitions of oppre&s;&s;ion and EXTORTION, &amp; evince their &s;pecific difference, from &s;acred &amp; prophane hi&s;tory, but I pre&s;ume this would be a needle&s;s attempt. The crime of EXTORTION is &s;o com|mon among&s;t us, that however ignorant people of other countries may be of it, the inhabitants of America are &s;o well acquainted by experience, with all its my&s;teries of iniquity, that what has been already &s;aid of its nature, may be deemed amply &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the &s;econd propo&s;ition of my di&s;|cour&s;e, namely. To &s;how its great ba&s;ene&s;s and malignity.</P>
<P>IT flows originally from the grand &s;ource of all &s;in, the univer&s;al depravity and corruption of our nature contract|ed by the fall. It proceeds from that unrighteous, wick|ed, covetous, malicious, envious, deceitful, unnatural, &s;elfi&s;h, unmerciful di&s;po&s;ition, which was the con&s;equence of the original apo&s;tacy, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.29. It proceeds from that &s;ordid avarice, that infamous love of money, which the apo&s;tle avers, <HI>is the root of all evil</HI>&mdash;from that love of
<PB N="8" REF="015859_0007_0F9A2F884FB4DBD8">
the world which is enmity again&s;t God&mdash;from that cove|tou&s;ne&s;s which is idolatry&mdash;from that mean love of pri|vate intere&s;t, which would &s;acrifice the welfare of a whole community for the &s;ake of one's own filthy lucre. Thus we &s;ee it is directly oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e two great command|ments, the love of God and the love of our neighbour, on which hang the whole law and the prophets&mdash;It proceeds from littlene&s;s of &s;oul, contractedne&s;s of mind, ba&s;ene&s;s and narrowne&s;s of heart, low, unmanly, ungene|rous, ignoble, and grovling principles. It is an act of the mo&s;t flagrant inju&s;tice and malevolence again&s;t the peace, comfort, and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, and highly inimical to our country. I ob&s;erved that covetou&s;ne&s;s, from which <HI>extortion</HI> &s;prings, is idolatry. What is idola|try? It is be&s;towing that &s;upreme love on the creature, which is due to the Creator alone. And doth not the <HI>extortioner</HI> love the world and mammon more than God? Doth he not &s;acrifice his time, talents and affections to tho&s;e ba&s;e idols, and for their &s;akes, live in the continual violation of his Maker's laws?</P>
<P>IT is a direct tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a po&s;&s;itive, divine com|mandment. <HI>Ye &s;hall not oppre&s;s one another, neither &s;hall ye vex nor oppre&s;s a &s;tranger,</HI> is the expre&s;s mandate of the &s;upreme Legi&s;lator. Compare <HI>Exod.</HI> 22.27. with <HI>Lev.</HI> 25.14. &amp; 17. With this corre&s;ponds al&s;o, the apo|&s;tolic exhortation to all chri&s;tians, 1. <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 4.2. &amp; 6. <HI>Ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Je&s;us,
<PB N="9" REF="015859_0008_0F9A2F8911656E20">
that no man go beyond, and defraud</HI> (or as the word might be rendered OPPRESS) <HI>his brother in any matter, for the Lord in the avenger of all &s;uch.</HI></P>
<P>IT is directly contrary both to the law and the go&s;pel. It breaks the fir&s;t and &s;econd commandment of the fir&s;t table, which re&s;pects our duty to God, as it idolizes mam|mon, riches, and the world, and prefers them before the infinitely greate&s;t and be&s;t of beings; it tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the &s;econd, as it pays its adoration, its principal care, love &amp; attention, to a little molten gold &amp; &s;ilver, to a few bundles of figured paper, and to the painted trifles of the pre&s;ent &s;cene. It con&s;iders and regards them as the &s;upreme good, and as it were, bows down to wor&s;hip them. It violates the eighth and tenth commandment of the &s;econd table, which re&s;pects our duty to our neighbour. <HI>Thou &s;halt not covet any thing that is thy neighbour's</HI> (&s;ays the law) but the <HI>extortioner,</HI> under the influence of that &s;ordid lu&s;t, avarice, ba&s;ely covets other mens property; moreo|ver, he who doth not give his neighbour an equivalent for his money, and exacts from him a greater price for his merchandize than it is worth, not only covets, but vir|tually, and in the &s;ight of God, &s;teals his neighbour's pro|perty. What is &s;tealing? It is the unlawful taking away what it another's&mdash;and although there &s;hould be no human law to regular the price of things, and forbid ex|orbitant profits <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, they are contrary to the natural laws of ju&s;tice and equity, written on every man's con&s;cience;
<PB N="10" REF="015859_0009_0F9A2F89D1A5CAB0">
they are contrary to Jehovah's expre&s;s prohibition, of <HI>ex|tortion</HI> and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT this &s;ordid vice, is not only a manife&s;t tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion of the law; but it is diametrically oppo&s;ite to the genius, &s;pirit, de&s;ign, and tendency of the go&s;pel, the ex|ample of its amiable and divine author, and his holy apo|&s;tles&mdash;it is directly contrary to the love of mankind, and all tho&s;e generous virtues enjoined upon chri&s;tians. It is a flagrant contravention of that excellent and univer&s;ally approved golden rule of equity, <HI>What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o unto them.</HI> It is a notorious violation of tho&s;e capital and important com|mandments of our Savior, on which he laid &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s, and an obedience to which he mentions as a peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of our di&s;ciple&s;hip and relation to him, I mean the commandments of loving one ano|ther, and loving our neighbour as our&s;elves. It is a di|rect infringement of the go&s;pel injunction, to do good to all as we have opportunity&mdash;to pity the afflicted, &s;ympathize with the &s;uffering, relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, a&s;&s;i&s;t the widow and fatherle&s;s; the &s;tranger and the needy, to promote the honor of religion, the welfare of the church, and our own meetne&s;s for the enjoyment of God.</P>
<P>IT is contrary to the example of Chri&s;t, who being God manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, gave him&s;elf for us, and al|though rich, became poor for our &s;akes, that we through
<PB N="11" REF="015859_0010_0F9A2F8A915174D8">
his poverty might be made rich. It is contrary to the example of the holy apo&s;tles, who &s;pended and were &s;pent for the welfare of mankind, and did not account their lives, their e&s;tates, their comforts dear, if &s;o be they might fini&s;h their cour&s;e with joy; and the mini&s;try they had received from the Lord Je&s;us, to te&s;tify for the tem|poral and eternal benefit of others, the go&s;pel of the grace of God. They &s;uffered &s;tripes, bani&s;hment, cruel mockings, confi&s;cation of goods, impri&s;onment&mdash;they wandered about from place to place, being de&s;titute, af|flicted, tormented&mdash;they expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the great|e&s;t perils, they underwent the greate&s;t difficulties and fa|tigues, they undertook the mo&s;t tedious journeys, and dangerous voyages&mdash;and they endured pain, watchings, hunger, thir&s;t, fa&s;ting, cold, nakedne&s;s&mdash;They faced mi&s;ery and death in a thou&s;and frightful &s;hapes, for the benefit of mankind.</P>
<P>IT is a &s;hameful rever&s;e of the example of the primi|tive chri&s;tians at Jeru&s;alem, who &s;old their e&s;tates, and di&s;tributed the money ari&s;ing from the &s;ales, to &s;upply the wants of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brethren. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that believed (&s;ays the &s;acred Hi&s;torian) had all things common, and &s;old their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.44, 45. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is a crime &s;hame|fully di&s;graced by the virtue of the heathen, who de&s;pi&s;|ed money and private intere&s;t, when it came in competition with the public good.

How many are neg|lecting their private affairs, and expo&s;ing them&s;elves, their lives and fortunes, to the rage of an implacable foe, in the councils of this continent&mdash;and how many thou&s;ands more have left their hou&s;es, occupations, intere&s;t, wives, children, parents and deare&s;t connexions, and have volun|tarily expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the inexpre&s;&s;ible hard&s;hips of Summer's and Winter's campaigns, and all the horrors of impri&s;onment, famine, de&s;olation, wounds, &s;laughter, and death, for the &s;afety and deliverance of their bleeding country. Now what a &s;hameful contra&s;t to all the&s;e glorious examples, is the <HI>extortioner,</HI> who endeavors to fatten by the fall, thrive by the ruin, and enrich him&s;elf by the impoveri&s;hment of his brethren&mdash;who &s;acrifices religion, liberty, his country&mdash;the blood of the faithful &s;oldier the councils of the worthy patriot, the happi|ne&s;s of millions now alive, and the happine&s;s of millions yet unborn, to his &s;ordid pa&s;&s;ion for private gain.

<PB N="13" REF="015859_0012_0F9A2F8CC43D2CB0">
with the mo&s;t contemptible trifles of time. His immor|tal &s;oul, capable of angelic and cele&s;tial delights, and of a&s;piring to a likene&s;s and enjoyment of the DEITY, flut|ters in the dirt, wallows in the mire, contracts it&s;elf up into the ba&s;e&s;t and meane&s;t &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s as the &s;nail draws it&s;elf up into its &s;hell, and is only active to obtain enjoy|ments common with the brutes&mdash;he envies the happine&s;s of his neighbors, he labors hard for their de&s;truction&mdash;he in fact regards not the tears of the widow and fatherle&s;s, the groans of the poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and the mi&s;eries of the friends of mankind. If good offices and charity to &s;uch objects are the fruits of benevolence; then &s;urely grinding the faces of the poor, extorting from unhappy &s;ufferers their &s;mall pittance, by exorbitant prices for the nece&s;&s;aries of life, mu&s;t be the effects of a hard, cruel, malevolent, unfeeling heart, de&s;titute of humanity and compa&s;&s;ion. <HI>Extortion</HI> is a crime &s;o &s;ordid and odious, that even the Phari&s;ee thanked God, and congratulated him&s;elf, that he was not guilty of it; and the apo&s;tle Paul ranks it with the mo&s;t attrocious &s;ins, &s;uch as drunken|ne&s;s, theft, and &s;odomy. Nay, he warns chri&s;tians not even to eat with, or to hold the lea&s;t communication with them; but to avoid them as a plague, as a nui&s;ance, as an abo|mination, as odious criminals, who&s;e per&s;ons are con|temptible, and who&s;e company is a di&s;grace.

<P>I now proceed to the la&s;t point propo&s;ed, namely, to &s;hew the fatal and pernicious tendency of <HI>extortion.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It tends to deba&s;e the &s;oul, and render it aver&s;e to religion, devotion, and communion with God. The holy apo&s;tle declares, that the friend&s;hip of this world is enmity again&s;t God. If any man (&s;ays he) will be the friend of the world, the &s;ame is the enemy of God. If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him. Thus <HI>extortion,</HI> which is both an effect and an en|couragement of this ignoble pa&s;&s;ion, leads us away from the only fountain of bli&s;s, to tho&s;e &s;ordid pur&s;uits, occupations, and enjoyments in which it cannot be found. It frequently impels the avaricious mind to the commi&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t attrocious crimes of which human nature can po&s;&s;ibly be guilty. The love of money (according to the unerring voice of in&s;piration) is the root of all evil, which &s;ome having coveted after, have erred from the faith, and pierced them&s;elves through with many &s;orrows. Balaam was induced to advi&s;e the ruin of I&s;rael, Judas to betray his innocent Lord and Ma&s;ter, and many others to betray their friends and &s;ell their country for money. Some have wi&s;hed their relations dead, and others have actually embrued their hands in their blood, for the love
<PB N="15" REF="015859_0014_0F9A2F8D9040F320">
of filthy lucre. Numbers have been inveigled by this infamous pa&s;&s;ion, to commit theft, forgery, perjury, and other criminal actions, which have brought them to the gallows.</P>
<P>It throws in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles in the way to hea|ven; renders us aver&s;e to, and unfit for its enjoyments, and damps every generous purpo&s;e for the welfare of others. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord declares, <HI>that it is ea&s;ier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven:</HI> We accordingly read that the young man in the go&s;pel, went away &s;orrowful from Chri&s;t, becau&s;e he had <HI>great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</HI> What keeps &s;o many rich, &s;o many mighty, &s;o many noble, from em|bracing the go&s;pel? Is it not their attachment to the unrighteous mammon? What is the rea&s;on of all that meanne&s;s di&s;covered by many pretended friends of liberty, in equivocating, lying, &s;wearing fal&s;ly, refu&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t their country in the cabinet or the field? What is the rea&s;on of their lukewarmne&s;s, inactivity, changing of &s;ides, and finally abandoning the glorious cau&s;e of Ame|rican liberty? Is it not the ba&s;e&s;t &s;elf-intere&s;t, and the &s;or|did love of money? He who is re&s;olved to be rich, at all adventures, and on no account to &s;acrifice private intere&s;t or part with his pur&s;e, mu&s;t needs be guilty of many ba&s;e and mean actions, and will infallibly fall into a &s;nare, and many hurtful lu&s;ts which drown men in|to perdition.

Extortion in a &s;pecial manner (&s;ays one) "is very unmerciful and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the poor, their circum&s;tances call for our pity and com|panion. But what doth the extortioner? In&s;tead of af|fording relief, he adds to their mi&s;eries and wants. Yea further, is not Extortion in a great mea&s;ure the cau&s;e of

their mi&s;ery? Doth it not bring the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing calamity of pinching want upon thou&s;ands, who otherwi&s;e might have been &s;trangers to &s;uch deep affliction forever! What a &s;hocking reflection doth this afford! What complacen|cy can the Extortioner take in his unju&s;t gain, while ma|ny from whom he has extorted it and who are intitled to his mercy and compa&s;&s;ion, may be now groaning and dy|ing for want? at lea&s;t it is not owing to his benevolence if they are not."</P>
<P N="5">5. Oppre&s;&s;ion and Extortion naturally tend to the ru|in of tho&s;e very per&s;ons that practice them. I have &s;hewn their obvious tendency to ruin the army and the country, and in their ruin Extortioners will be involved as much, if not more than others. I have al&s;o &s;hewn that ill-got|ten wealth is a cur&s;e to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and their po&s;terity. If the enemy &s;hould prevail, what will all their bundles of Continental Bills avail? they will be probably of lit|tle more worth than &s;o much wa&s;te paper. By his &s;or|did and exorbitant profits, the Extortioner is making a &s;word to pierce his own bowels, and he is pulling down the pillars that &s;upport the goodly fabric of liberty and property, which will fall upon his head and cru&s;h him with its ruins. Extortioners may think they are &s;afe, becau&s;e the &s;eat of war is at a di&s;tance; but if the Southern States are &s;ubdued, it is to be feared the&s;e Northern Colonies will &s;hare the &s;ame fate, and if they are conquered, their &s;ufferings probably will be greater

than others, as they have mo&s;t vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the common oppre&s;&s;ors&mdash;therefore it is much better for them to fight the enemy where they are, than to have to con|tend with them at home&mdash;the mo&s;t prudent &s;tep is to make one great effort now, before the enemy make any farther conque&s;ts; for I imagine the more places they have in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, humanly &s;peaking, there is the greater probability of our de&s;truction and their &s;ucce&s;s. If, in|&s;tead of trying to gain by Extortion, General Wa&s;hing|ton had been properly &s;upported, it is probable the enemy would not have been now in Philadelphia. How painful is the con&s;ideration, that a brave people, &s;o zealous for Liberty, &s;o prodigal of their blood in it's cau&s;e, &s;hould now endanger it by that mean, &s;candalous, mercenary, &s;ordid vice; the vile nature, ba&s;ene&s;s, and tendency of which I have been endeavouring to &s;et before you. How di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the idea, that a people, who were the foremo&s;t for the public good, &s;hould now be ready to &s;acrifice it for the ba&s;e&s;t &s;elf-intere&s;t, and to a &s;ordid de&s;ire of filthy lucre! What will Europe think of it? What will the re&s;t of the States &s;ay of it? Will they not be ready to &s;uppo&s;e that all the boa&s;ts of patrioti&s;m and public virtue in this country were fal&s;e, and that the mo&s;t dete&s;table views of private advantage lay concealed under all tho&s;e fair and &s;pecious appearances? What will po&s;terity think of you? Your renowned ance&s;tors left Great-Britain and all their intere&s;t in it, brav'd the fury of the Atlantic, came to this once barren and howling wilderne&s;s and ex|po&s;ed
