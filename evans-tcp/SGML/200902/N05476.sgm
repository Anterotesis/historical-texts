<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following Di&s;cour&s;e was at fir&s;t written for the In&s;truction and Admonition of my own Pari&s;h, without any View at that Time, of it's going farther; but being called, by your Honour, to preach before the General-A&s;&s;embly, I could not think upon any Subject better adapted to the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of our Country, and more nece&s;&s;ary to be in&s;i&s;ted on. The Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es having honoured it with their Approba|tion, and de&s;ired it &s;hould be printed, I very wil|lingly comply with their Reque&s;t, as it may be a Means of rendering the Truths contained in-it more publick and diffu&s;ive, and may po&s;&s;ibly contribute &s;omething towards the Cure of this enormous Vice.</P>
<P>IT was not without a &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure, that I ob&s;erved a Vein of Piety run through your Honour's SPEECH to the General-A&s;&s;embly, and a high Re|gard expre&s;&s;ed for the true Intere&s;ts of Religion.
<PB REF="006939_0004_102A9C2F94C732D8">It is upon this, Sir, that the Thrones of Kings are e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that Princes and Magi&s;trates reign and decree Ju&s;tice. So that every Violation of the Dictates of Religion and Morality is, not only an Act of Rebellion again&s;t the Maje&s;ty of Almighty GOD, but al&s;o a flagrant Offence again&s;t the real Intere&s;ts, and true Felicity, of the State. And this is the Rea&s;on, that all wi&s;e and well con&s;tituted Governments have ever had the utmo&s;t Attention to Religion, and made it's Purity and Practice their fir&s;t and principal Concern.</P>
<P>BUT how de&s;tructive of every religious Senti|ment, and corruptive of all Hone&s;ty and Morality, this flagitious Practice is, hath been, I hope, &s;uffi|ciently &s;et forth and explained in this Sermon. It is upon you, Sir, that the Executive Part of our Government now chiefly re&s;ts; and if, by a proper Vigour in the Execution of the Laws again&s;t it, or by any other Method, you can di&s;courage and &s;uppre&s;s this crying Enormity, it will greatly re|dound to the Honour of your Admini&s;tration; which that it may be long and happy over us, is the &s;incere Wi&s;h, and &s;hall be the con&s;tant Prayer of, Sir,</P>

<HEAD>A SERMON, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>EXODUS XX.&mdash;Part of v 17.</BIBL>
<P>Thou &s;halt not covet.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words contain the principal Verb and preceptive Part of the tenth Commandment; and I have cho&s;en them for a Di&s;cour&s;e upon a particular Kind of Coveting, which is become a growing and crying Evil among us. I believe, you will ea&s;ily judge, that the Coveting, which I mean, is that of Gaming; a Vice, that always hath it's Root in Avarice, and which, in it's greedy Wi&s;hes and Aims, devours it's <HI>Neighbour's Hou&s;es and Lands, his Man-Servants and his Maid Servants, his Oxen and his A&s;&s;es, and every Thing el&s;e, that is his.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, it may be thought perhaps by &s;ome Per&s;ons, that this is a Subject below the Ani|madver&s;ion and Dignity of this Place. But altho' Gaming is in it&s;elf a very low and contemptible Vice, yet as it is, in all its Complications and Con|&s;equences, a Sin of a very deep Dye and aggravated
<PB N="6" REF="006939_0006_102A9C35561E6A20">Nature,&mdash;and as it is at pre&s;ent very prevalent among us, and hath, within the&s;e few Years, grown vi&s;ibly, and as it were to the Eye; &mdash; I am &s;ure, I &s;hall never e&s;teem any &s;uch to be below my Duty and Function. On the contrary, both as a Mini&s;ter of GOD's Word, and as a Lover of my Country, I &s;hall joyfully embrace every Occa&s;ion, as well publick as private, of bearing my Te&s;timony again&s;t a Practice, &s;o very &s;inful and hurtful to Men's Souls, and &s;o va&s;tly injurious and de&s;tructive to every Country, where it is much followed.</P>
<P>BUT it may perhaps be objected, that all Ga|ming is not of this heinous and &s;inful Nature; but that, in &s;ome In&s;tances and Degrees, it is a lawful and innocent Diver&s;ion. This indeed is a di&s;puted Point among Morali&s;ts and Divines; but I believe, it is generally agreed to be &s;inful, as &s;oon as ever it cea&s;es to be a mere Amu&s;ement, and becomes a Conte&s;t for Money, &s;o that Avarice mingles it&s;elf with, and corrupts, its Nature. However, not to &s;crew Things up to their greate&s;t Height and Se|verity, and to err rather on the mild and good-na|tured than on the &s;our and unrelenting Side, I &s;hall willingly grant, that even Gaming for Money, in &s;ome In&s;tances and Degrees, may be a lawful and innocent Diver&s;ion. But then let me add, that tho&s;e In&s;tances and Degrees are much fewer, I be|lieve, than it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed. For whenever Gaming engro&s;&s;es too much of our Thought and Affection, or employs too much of our Time; &mdash; whenever it leads us into &s;inful Habits, or betrays us into violent and criminal Pa&s;&s;ions; &mdash; or when|ever it makes us neglect more u&s;eful Bu&s;ine&s;s and
<PB N="7" REF="006939_0007_102A9C36E0E55360">Pur&s;uits, or omit our nece&s;&s;ary Duties to GOD, our Neighbour, or our&s;elves; &mdash; in all the&s;e, and other &s;uch Ca&s;es, it immediately lo&s;es the Harm|le&s;ne&s;s of it's Nature, and degenerates into down|right Sin and Folly.</P>
<P>TO this it may be ob&s;erved, that the Spirit of Gaming is of a very growing and encroaching Na|ture; &s;o that no Man can &s;ay to it, <HI>thus far &s;halt thou come, and no farther;</HI> nor an&s;wer for the evil Con&s;equences of indulging it, even in the lowe&s;t Degree. It will therefore always be an e&s;pecial Point of Prudence, carefully to guard again&s;t, or even wholly to avoid, &s;uch a dangerous Contagion; le&s;t it gains in&s;en&s;ibly upon the Mind, and at la&s;t totally engro&s;&s;es and en&s;laves us.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides, Gaming, in it's mo&s;t innocent Degree, mu&s;t be acknowledged to be at be&s;t only a Supplement to Good-&s;en&s;e, which &s;erves to fill up the Vacancies of u&s;eful Di&s;cour&s;e and diverting Con|ver&s;ation. It's greate&s;t U&s;e is to kill Time, and to pa&s;s away tho&s;e Hours, which lie heavy upon the Hands of the Idle; and it's highe&s;t Prai&s;e is only the negative one, of keeping &s;uch Per&s;ons from hard Drinking, and other more &s;inful and pernici|ous Cour&s;es. So that to give it it's whole Due, it is nothing but a harmle&s;s Kind of Trifling, and a le&s;s hurtful Manner of fooling away our Time.</P>
<P>BUT however void of Guilt &s;o childi&s;h an Amu&s;ement may be, yet no &s;uch Thing, I am &s;ure, can be pleaded in Excu&s;e of high Gaming, which is an evident and undeniable Sin. For we therein
<PB N="8" REF="006939_0008_102A9C388FAF2AD0">&s;in again&s;t our Neighbour, again&s;t our Country, again&s;t our Families, again&s;t our&s;elves, and again&s;t GOD. And therefore, in the Pro&s;ecution of this Di&s;cour&s;e, I beg Leave to make &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on each of tho&s;e Heads. And,</P>
<P N="1">I. IN Gaming we &s;in again&s;t our Neighbour, as we therein covet our Neighbour's Goods, and are undoubtedly guilty of an eminent Breach of this tenth Commandment. For Covetou&s;ne&s;s is the Mother-Pa&s;&s;ion to the Spirit of Gaming; and no true Game&s;ter &s;its down to play with his Neighbour, without a determined De&s;ign again&s;t his Pur&s;e and his Property. It is not, to relieve the Mind after hard Application to other more &s;evere and u&s;eful Pur&s;uits, or to divert and trifle away an idle Hour, that the Game&s;ter plays, &mdash; but it is wholly with a View to get Money; &mdash; and the more he wins from his Neighbour, his Friend, or his very Brother, the more is he plea&s;ed, and the better are his Ends an|&s;wered; &s;o that, in Mind at lea&s;t, we are evidently guilty of hurting our Neighbour, as we de&s;ign and endeavour to gain from him his Nece&s;&s;aries and Conveniencies of Life.</P>
<P>AND indeed it were well, if it &s;topped there, and went no farther than a bare De&s;ire and Inten|tion of Mind. I am afraid it is con&s;tantly led on and brought into Act, and too often &s;ettles into a fixed Habit of Fraud and Knavery. For that Man mu&s;t certainly be an extraordinary Per&s;on, who can be for ever hankering after and eager for his Neigh|bour's Goods, and yet keep him&s;elf from all di&s;|hone&s;t Arts and fraudulent Practices towards obtain|ing
<PB N="9" REF="006939_0009_102A9C3B3ABC9F00">them. In truth, a &s;ettled Habit of Gaming, and &s;teady Principle of Hone&s;ty, &s;eem to be utterly repugnant and incon&s;i&s;tent with each other. Our Hone&s;ty will make us quit Gaming, or Gaming will make us de&s;ert our Hone&s;ty. Two &s;uch oppo&s;ite Principles can never long agree and dwell together in the &s;ame Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>AT fir&s;t indeed the Game&s;ter's Deflections from the Paths of Hone&s;ty may be mode&s;t and fearful. He will perhaps only take, what, in the Style of that Art and My&s;tery, are called fair Advantages; that is to &s;ay, he will only take Advantage of his Neigh|bour's Ignorance, and cheat him by his own Mi&s;|take. And this, according to the Ca&s;ui&s;try of the Gaming-Table, is entirely con&s;onant to the Rules of Ju&s;tice and Honour; altho' by all other Laws of GOD and Man it is accounted a palpable Fraud and arrant Knavery. For certainly, the Man, that takes Advantage of my Ignorance and &s;teals my Hor&s;e, or that robs my Hou&s;e, by my Mi&s;take or Inadverten|cy in leaving my Key in the Door, is as hone&s;t as he, that wins my Money upon the like Ignorance or Mi&s;|take. And there is no Court of Ju&s;tice, but what will oblige a Man to rectify any Errors, that may be committed in the Settlement of an Account, and refund the Money, which he hath unju&s;tly got from his Neighbour, by his own Acutene&s;s, or the other's Negligence or Error. And yet from &s;uch Princi|ples doth the Game&s;ter's Sy&s;tem of Morality &s;et out; &s;uch, I &s;ay, as contradict the plaine&s;t Dictates of Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice. And when the Mind is once debauched and corrupted by &s;uch wicked Prin|ciples, it is no Wonder, if it afterwards wades on
<PB N="10" REF="006939_0010_102A9C3DC635DFD0">from Guilt to Guilt, till it at la&s;t arrives at all the in&s;idious Arts, iniquitous Tricking, and knavi&s;h Refinements of Gaming.</P>
<P>AND this Habit of cheating and tricking, which is contracted at the Gaming Table, will dif|fu&s;e it&s;elf through all other Parts of a Man's Deal|ings and Conduct. He will not be able to buy any thing without a Nick, or to &s;ell the lea&s;t Trifle without a Bite. <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? then may ye al&s;o do Good, that are accu&s;tomed to do Evil.</HI> Jer. xiii. 23. The Habit of &s;huffling and cou&s;ening will be &s;o grafted and rooted in their very Nature, that it will &s;hew it&s;elf in every Branch of their Behaviour, and every the mo&s;t indifferent Office of Life. So that Life it&s;elf is with them one continual Scene of Gaming, and their whole Study and Employment in it is to lie upon the Watch, and to take all Advantages, that offer.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed one Step farther: I wi&s;h the Evil of Gaming terminated even here. But it is often found to go &s;till farther, and at la&s;t to bring Men to downright Stealing and Robbery. For it is well known, that there never was any notorious Thief or Robber, who was not at the &s;ame Time a notorious Game&s;ter. And when the near Pro&s;|pect of Death obliges tho&s;e wretched Creatures to repent of the Evil of their Ways, it may be ob&s;erved, that a Caution again&s;t this unrighteous and corrup|tive Practice always makes one Part of their dying Admonitions, as it hath always been one main Road, that led them to that mi&s;erable End.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="006939_0011_102A9C3F9975DE38">
NEITHER is this the wor&s;t of it yet. For Gaming is often known to lead Men to tho&s;e black|er and more odious Crimes of Duelling and Murder. Nay, the De&s;pair and Di&s;traction of the Ruin and Beggary, which they have brought upon them&s;elves and Families, hath &s;ometimes carried the unhappy Wretches to that highe&s;t and mo&s;t horrid of all Crimes, the Sin of Self-Murder; and has made them ru&s;h wildly into the Pre&s;ence of Almighty GOD, with all their Sins and Iniquities fre&s;h upon them, and without a Po&s;&s;ibility of redeeming their Conduct by a future Repentance and Amendment.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort; no good and prudent Man can ever concern him&s;elf far with this abominable Practice of Gaming. For if he is a good Man, he will not him&s;elf cheat; and if he is a prudent Man, he will never engage him&s;elf among a Pack of Thieves and Sharpers, where, if he will not cheat, he is &s;ure to be cheated.&mdash;But as in Gaming we thus &s;in again&s;t our Neighbour. So,</P>
<P N="2">II. ARE we guilty of a very heinous Sin a|gain&s;t our Country. And this plainly follows from what has been urged under the former Head. For if Gaming has a natural and direct Tendency, to &s;ap the Hone&s;ty, and to corrupt the Morals of a People, then Gaming is undoubtedly a mo&s;t grie|vous Offence again&s;t every Country, where it is practi&s;ed. For moral Virtue and Hone&s;ty is the grand Fountain of publick Honour and Felicity; as the Vice and Wickedne&s;s of a Nation are the cer|tain Forerunners and Cau&s;e of it's Di&s;grace and De|&s;truction:
<PB N="12" REF="006939_0012_102A9C4276208588">According to that excellent Remark of the Wi&s;eman; <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a Nation, but Sin is a Reproach to any People.</HI> Prov. xiv. 34.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides, the Strength and Pro&s;perity of every Country entirely depend upon the Number and hone&s;t Indu&s;try of it's Inhabitants, who by their Labour and Manufactures increa&s;e the publick Stock, and add to the general Wealth of the Nation. Every hone&s;t Labourer, of any u&s;eful Trade or Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, that faithfully and indu&s;triou&s;ly follows the &s;ame, is &s;o far a Benefactor to the Publick, and contributes to the Wealth and Pro&s;perity of his Country. As on the contrary, every Art or Pur|&s;uit, that tends to make the People idle, and to draw them off from their hone&s;t Callings and u&s;eful Trades, immediately becomes hurtful and pernicious to the Community. The&s;e are &s;ome of the fir&s;t Principles of Polity&mdash;and plaine&s;t Truths in the Science of Government.</P>
<P>BUT now, what can be imagined, more de&s;truc|tive of Indu&s;try, a greater Enemy to hone&s;t Labour, and more immediately calculated to draw Men off from their u&s;eful Callings, and to render them idle and vagrant, than this Practice of Gaming? For when Mankind can be &s;o far gulled and deceived in their Hopes, as to promi&s;e them&s;elves more Pro|fit from one Hour's Play, than from a Year's La|bour, human Nature will be apt to be too indulgent to it&s;elf, and joyfully to embrace the Scheme of much Money and little Trouble. And thus are they induced to quit their &s;everal u&s;eful Call|ings and Profe&s;&s;ions, and to gad about from Place
<PB N="13" REF="006939_0013_102A9C44962A31C0">to Place, in Pur&s;uit of the&s;e wild Hopes and ima|ginary Riches. Whereas, if they would give them|&s;elves the Trouble of making a ju&s;t Calculation of the Matter, they would &s;oon find &s;o much expend|ed in travelling Charges, &s;o much thrown away in Drinking, Rioting, and other concomitant Vices of Gaming, that upon the whole they are them|&s;elves great Lo&s;ers, and that the Tavern-keepers, and other Panders to their Vices, are generally the chief Gainers.</P>
<P>BUT on the other hand, what po&s;&s;ible Advan|tage can accrue to a Country from the Practice of Gaming? What u&s;eful Art is promoted? What Manufactures are carried on? Or what Addition is there made by it to the publick Stock and Wealth of a People? None certainly. For the Whole of Gaming is only to &s;hift the Property and Specie, which hath been acquired to a Country and brought in by the hone&s;t Labourer's Indu&s;try, from one Hand to another, &mdash; and oftentimes from the more worthy to the mo&s;t unworthy Members of the Society. And Arts and Manufactures are &s;o far from being advanced by it, that it is the greate&s;t Ob&s;truction imaginable to them, by drawing off tho&s;e Hands to the Ways of Idlene&s;s and Knavery, which by GOD and their Station in Life, are de|&s;igned for Labour, and which ought by all the Rea&s;on in the World to be &s;o employed. So that to call them off from their nece&s;&s;ary Employments, is in truth to rob their Country of the Profit and Advantage of their Labours, and even to run coun|ter to GOD's Providence, and to contradict his di|vine Will in allotting them their Rank and Con|dition
<PB N="14" REF="006939_0014_102A9C4690B30258">in the World. And that this is the Ca&s;e a|mong us is very notorious; when Per&s;ons, who by their Fortune and Figure in Life are marked out for Labour, dare to de&s;ert their Po&s;t at the Plow and the Hoe, where they may do their Country good Service by increa&s;ing the publick Export and Riches, and betake them&s;elves to the more ea&s;y and idle, but le&s;s hone&s;t Employment of Gaming.</P>
<P>AND as this is true of the inferior Sort of Peo|ple, &s;o is it more particularly applicable to Gen|tlemen and Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction. As they have a greater Stake in a Country, and enjoy a larger Property, &s;o are they bound, both in Gratitude and Intere&s;t, to be more &s;tudious of that Country's Good, and to prevent every Art or Practice, that &s;hall be found hurtful to it. In&s;tead of wa&s;ting and lavi&s;hing away their Time, their Money, and their Con&s;titution, at the Gaming Table, they ought to be employed in <HI>devi&s;ing liberal Things,</HI> in &s;etting forward any u&s;eful Project or Branch of Trade and Manufacture, and in promoting every Thing, that may tend to the publick Good and Improvement. In&s;tead of throwing away their Money among the rapacious and unthankful Tribe of Game&s;ters, they ought to <HI>ca&s;t their Bread upon the Waters,</HI> by em|ploying the hone&s;t and indu&s;trious Poor, and &s;o <HI>af|ter many Days</HI> they will be &s;ure <HI>to find it again,</HI> re|paid with U&s;ury, both in this World and the next. In&s;tead of defiling them&s;elves with &s;o foul a Prac|tice, and &s;etting Fa&s;hions to the lower People in Vice, they ought by their Example to lead them on to every Thing, that is virtuous and hone&s;t, and with the utmo&s;t Severity of the Law to re&s;train and
<PB N="15" REF="006939_0015_102A9C49848086E0">puni&s;h this execrable Cu&s;tom; a Cu&s;tom &s;o evident|ly corruptive of the People, and &s;o prejudicial to the Publick, that there is no Country in the World, where it ro&s;e to any Height, that did not immedi|ately prohibit it under the &s;evere&s;t Penalties. And this is certainly an unan&s;werable Proof of the uni|ver&s;al Sen&s;e of Mankind concerning it's pernicious Nature and Tendency. But,</P>
<P N="3">III. IN Gaming we are al&s;o guilty of a Sin again&s;t our Families. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE all owe to our Families an hone&s;t Di|ligence and careful Endeavour to &s;upport and main|tain them according to our &s;everal Stations and Abi|lities; which Duty, I am afraid, is not much re|garded by the Gentlemen of this Profe&s;&s;ion. For although the Game&s;ter may &s;eem to be &s;ollicitous to provide for tho&s;e of his own Hou&s;e, and may be thought to follow his Calling out of a View and Hope of enriching him&s;elf and Family, yet &s;hall we be greatly mi&s;taken, if we think him &s;uch a careful Hu&s;band or Father. For how often is it found, whil&s;t Game&s;ters are flaunting it and flouri&s;hing a|broad, with their fine Hor&s;es, rich Furniture and Cloaths, and luxurious Living, that their Families are left at home in a pinching and &s;tarving Condition? Every Thing they can &s;crape and rend is &s;quandered away upon their own Vices and Extravagancies, with|out the lea&s;t Thought or Concern how far it may affect the Happine&s;s and Well-being of their Wives and Children. Neither is it to be wondered at. For this Vice is certainly very de&s;tructive of all the
<PB N="16" REF="006939_0016_102A9C4B4DB12468">gentler Pa&s;&s;ions of Tenderne&s;s and Humanity; and by the Habit of taking all Advantages, and con|tinually doing hard, unju&s;t, and cruel Things, it &s;teels the Mind, as it were, again&s;t every kind and benevolent Sentiment.</P>
<P>BUT yet farther: Although a Game&s;ter &s;hould win much, yet is he at the &s;ame Time obliged to be at a con&s;tant and great Charge; and whether he wins or lo&s;es, his Expences are &s;till high. So that upon the whole, taking their Expences into the Calculation, every Man bets again&s;t &s;uch Odds, as in a long Run of Play, without the helping Hand of a little Cogging and Co&s;enage, mu&s;t undo the riche&s;t Man alive. To which we may add that Ex|travagancy, which will be naturally bred in the Mind, by having &s;uch large Sums perpetually flow|ing in and going out. This brings them to &s;et but little Value upon Money, and makes them think and act, as if they were the ab&s;olute and real Ma&s;|ters of all the Ca&s;h, that pa&s;&s;es through their Hands.

1. HOWEVER innocent Gaming may &s;eem to our Health and bodily Welfare, yet upon a ju&s;t Examination of the Matter we &s;hall find it very prejudicial to the Con&s;titution. For the Game&s;ter is obliged to be a Man of all Hours: He is forced to &s;it up, and to drink; and (as the Antitype of of St. <HI>Paul) to be made all Things to all Men, that he may by all Means</HI> ruin <HI>&s;ome.</HI> He is an in&s;idi|ous Animal, that is eternally upon the Watch for his Prey; and however di&s;gu&s;tful it may be to him|&s;elf, or hurtful to his Con&s;titution; he mu&s;t ei|ther quit the Profit and Fine&s;&s;e of his Profe&s;&s;ion, or el&s;e he mu&s;t univer&s;ally conform him&s;elf to all Kinds of Humours and Vices. However his Body may crave it's Re&s;t, at tho&s;e Hours, which GOD and Nature have a&s;&s;igned for Refre&s;hment and Repo&s;e; yet hath he more Sen&s;e than to obey the Calls of Nature, and thereby lo&s;e the hopeful Pro&s;pect of getting Money, which will only co&s;t him a little Trouble and much Knavery.</P>
<P>BUT as to tho&s;e Gentlemen, who would not be thought to make Gaming their Profe&s;&s;ion, and that only now and then throw away Part of their Time and E&s;tates in this innocent and laudable Diver&s;ion, I refer it to their own Con&s;ciences, whether they do not often find them&s;elves betrayed by it into hard Drinking and late Hours? And this will be for ever promoted by the expert and dextrous Game&s;ter; it being one of the hone&s;t Arts and grand My&s;teries of their Craft and Calling, fir&s;t to make Men drunk, and then to win their Money. In &s;hort, it is a con|&s;tant and invariable Rule always to follow Nature;
<PB N="19" REF="006939_0019_102A9C525522EB50">and whoever turns Night into Day, and Day into Night (however the Thing may be palliated and di&s;gui&s;ed, or however excu&s;ed and defended) yet certainly runs counter to this Rule, does a Vio|lence to Nature, and mu&s;t injure his Health and Con&s;titution. Neither,</P>
<P N="2">2. IS it le&s;s injurious to our Minds, than it is to our Bodies. It exceeds the Power of Language to expre&s;s the Pangs and Angui&s;h, the Remor&s;e and Bitterne&s;s of Soul, that mu&s;t attend a ruined E&s;tate and beggared Family. No Colours can paint, nor Words de&s;cribe the Grief and Di&s;traction of &s;uch a Man. And even when it does not come to that Height; yet a bad Run of Luck, and the Lo&s;s of a Sum of Money, which we are in immediate and pre&s;&s;ing Want of, and which perhaps we know not how to rai&s;e again, mu&s;t give a Man no &s;mall Pain and Compunction. And indeed the Game&s;ter's Art is the very Rever&s;e of the Wi&s;dom of the an|tient Sages and Philo&s;ophers. One grand Le&s;&s;on of theirs, and a principal Aim of their In&s;tructions, was to bring Men to a &s;ettled Peace and Tranquil|lity of Mind; without which they wi&s;ely concluded, there could be no &s;uch Thing as Happine&s;s in this Life. And this Truth was &s;o eagerly pur&s;ued, and &s;o over-run, as it were, by &s;ome of the Sects, that they fell into the unnatural Ab&s;urdity of an Apa|thy, or a perfect Unconcern and Di&s;regard for whatever can happen to us. But Gaming tends to the very contrary of this. It de&s;troys all ea&s;e and Tranquillity of Mind, and throws it into a con|tinual Confu&s;ion and Perturbation. The Tran&s;iti|ons from Grief to Joy, from Gain to Lo&s;s, are &s;o
<PB N="20" REF="006939_0020_102A9C5414645258">quick and perpetual, that the Pa&s;&s;ions are for ever kept in a Flame and Hurricane, and have not Time left them to grow cool and compo&s;ed. Philo&s;ophy profe&s;&s;es to teach us, to govern our Pa&s;&s;ions and command our Appetites; but this Anti-Philo&s;ophy, with &s;till greater Force and Efficacy, lets them loo&s;e, and renders them furious and ungovernable.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, by committing our&s;elves to the blind Arbitrement of Chance, to the Ca&s;t of a Dye or Turn of a Card, we give the Reins quite out of our own Hands, and lo&s;e all Power and Authority over our Spirits. We are to&s;&s;ed to and fro by every Wind of Pa&s;&s;ion, and are en&s;laved to wild De&s;ires, exce&s;&s;ive Hopes, impotent Joys, and groundle&s;s Griefs. 'Till at la&s;t we are &s;o abandoned to the&s;e frantic Tran&s;ports, that whenever Things &s;ucceed not according to our Wi&s;h, we immediately lo&s;e all Prudence, Temper, and Re&s;pect, and grow impious and profligate. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. Suppo&s;ing the Ca&s;e to be otherwi&s;e, that the Game&s;ter's <HI>Ways are Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and all his Paths are Peace:</HI> Suppo&s;ing, he is always &s;uc|ce&s;sful and a perpetual Gainer; yet, my Brethren, <HI>what is a Man profited, if he &s;hould gain the whole World, and lo&s;e his own Soul? or what &s;hall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</HI> Matt. xvi. 26. For you may ea&s;ily judge, from what hath been already &s;aid, that the Guilt of this Practice is very heinous and complicated; and that a State of Grace, and a State of Gaming, &s;eem hardly compatible with each other. And that this may appear the more fully, I proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="21" REF="006939_0021_102A9C559D29AED8">
V. THAT in Gaming we &s;in greviou&s;ly again&s;t GOD. And &s;urely of this there can be no Manner of Doubt. For how can that Man be innocent in the Sight of GOD, who breaks through and violates &s;o many, &s;o plain, and &s;uch important Divine Commands? How can he &s;tand ab&s;olved towards his Creator, who &s;ins again&s;t his Neighbour, his Country, his Family, and his own Soul; and con&s;equently, in each of tho&s;e Particulars, is guilty of a mo&s;t egregious Offence again&s;t GOD?</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides the&s;e oblique Ways of offending GOD, Gaming naturally leads to, and is produc|tive of, &s;ome of the mo&s;t direct and audacious Af|fronts imaginable again&s;t the Divine Maje&s;ty. For what horrid Oaths and Bla&s;phemies, what dreadful Imprecations, and &s;hocking Impieties, are con|&s;tantly attendant upon this frantic and outragious Diver&s;ion? The groundle&s;s, unprovoked, and abo|minable Habit of Cur&s;ing and Swearing is indeed but too common through all Parts of Life; and cannot but give continual Pain and Concern to every &s;erious and pious Chri&s;tian. But yet the Gaming Table &s;eems to be the peculiar Soil and darling Re|&s;idence of Oaths and Bla&s;phemies. There every puny Mortal, that has lo&s;t a Sum of Money, thinks him&s;elf authori&s;ed to call Divine Providence to an Account; and is &s;ure to li&s;t up his Voice aloud again&s;t GOD, and to pour forth the Bitterne&s;s of his Soul again&s;t the Almighty. And the&s;e indeed do it in &s;erious Sadne&s;s, and in the Height of their Grief and Frenzy; whil&s;t others are led on by it to
<PB N="22" REF="006939_0022_102A9C5956283208">an habitual Cour&s;e of Bla&s;phemy and Profanene&s;s, and lo&s;e all Sen&s;e of Reverence for the Name and Maje&s;ty of that <HI>GOD, in whom they live, and move, and have their Being.</HI> So that in cold Blood, as it were, and unprovoked, they will be throwing forth their Impieties; and even with &s;tudied Je&s;ts, and out of mere Wantonne&s;s, divert them&s;elves with Bla&s;phemies, <HI>ca&s;ting about Firebrands, Arrows, and Death, and &s;aying; Are we not in Sport?</HI> And ac|cordingly we may ob&s;erve, that in every Circle of Game&s;ters there is commonly one or two, who are the Buts and Diver&s;ion of the re&s;t; and who chiefly &s;hine by their Talent in pouring forth queer and unexpected Oaths, and inventing new Figures of Speech in the Art of Swearing and Profanene&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT however Divine Providence may be rated for their Lo&s;&s;es, and it's Ju&s;tice que&s;tioned, yet the Ca&s;e is quite altered, when they happen to win. Then they will be ready enough to <HI>&s;acrifice to their own Net,</HI> and to a&s;cribe their Succe&s;s to their own Merit and &s;uperior Wi&s;dom and Addre&s;s. GOD mu&s;t bear the Blame of their Mi&s;carriages; but they them&s;elves are applauded, as the &s;ole Authors, and dexterous Contrivers of all their good Fortune.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides the&s;e open and daring In&s;ults on the dread Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth, Gaming naturally begets in us many other &s;inful Ways and evil Habits. And particularly, notwith&s;tanding his perpetual U&s;e of the Lord's Name, yet hath the Game&s;ter little or no Sen&s;e of GOD and Religion upon his Mind. No Man can &s;erve two &s;uch op|po&s;ite Ma&s;ters, as GOD and Mammon; but our
<PB N="23" REF="006939_0023_102A9C5B08C894B8">Love to the one will make us cold and negligent in our Duty towards the other. And the Game&s;ter is &s;o blinded by the GOD of this World, and &s;o eager and devoted to his Service, that it will &s;oon bring him to neglect GOD's Ordinances and Sanctuary, and at la&s;t induce a total Deadne&s;s and In&s;en&s;ibility to all the Duties and Plea&s;ures of Religion. And thus does he habitually forget to &s;anctify the Sab|bath, to honour GOD's holy Name, and to tread the Courts of the Lord's Hou&s;e; gradually &s;inking into a State of &s;piritual Sloth and Irreligion, be|coming <HI>an Alien from the Commonwealth of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and a Stranger to the Covenants of Promi&s;e, having no Hope, and being without GOD in the World.</HI> Ephe&s;. ii. 12.</P>
<P>THUS exceeding great and grievous is the Guilt, contracted by this crying and execrable Sin of Gaming. I hope, that a ju&s;t Indignation again&s;t a Vice, &s;o profligate and irreligious, and &s;o produc|tive of Sin and Evil;&mdash;&s;o unrighteous in it&s;elf and injurious to our Neighbour, &s;o hurtful to our Country and de&s;tructive of all hone&s;t Labour and Indu&s;try, &s;o prejudicial to our Fortunes and Fami|lies, &s;o pernicious to our&s;elves both in Soul and Body, and above all &s;o madly audacious and affron|tive to GOD;&mdash;I hope, I &s;ay, that a ju&s;t Indig|nation again&s;t &s;o infamous and dete&s;table a Vice, may plead &s;ufficiently in my Excu&s;e, for any Seve|rity of Reflection, or Bitterne&s;s of Language, that may have fallen from me. I am &s;ure, nothing re|lating to our Country did ever give me &s;o much Grief and Concern, as to ob&s;erve this Frenzy grow, as it hath done of late, and &s;o mightily prevail a|mong
<PB N="24" REF="006939_0024_102A9C5C93426B80">us. It has &s;eized, without Exception, upon all Ranks and Conditions of our People; and hath equally infected <HI>the high and low, rich and poor, one with another.</HI></P>
<P>AND what is the &s;adde&s;t Circum&s;tance of the Whole, all this hath happened in De&s;pite and Defi|ance of excellent Laws again&s;t it, and by the Influ|ence and Example of tho&s;e very Per&s;ons, who, by their Stations and Oaths, and by every other Rea&s;on of Duty and Intere&s;t, are bound to re&s;train and puni&s;h it. And we of the Mini&s;try will lift up our Voice in vain, and may &s;peak, and preach, and print, again&s;t it without the lea&s;t Effect, as long as it hath to &s;upport it the Countenance and Example of Per&s;ons of Wealth and Eminence. For I have long ob&s;erved by a melancholy Experience, that the be&s;t written Di&s;cour&s;e, nay even the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t important In&s;tances of Duty, will lo&s;e all their Weight and Influence with the Generality of the People, if they are contradicted by the Lives and Conver&s;ations, or even by the unmannerly Scoffs and irreverent Gibes, of their rich and powerful Neighbours. As therefore, I believe, it is un|doubted, that this Madne&s;s fir&s;t got Footing among us, and &s;pread it&s;elf by the Practice and Example of Per&s;ons of Fortune and Di&s;tinction; &s;o will it chiefly lie upon them, to apply proper Remedies, and to put an effectual Stop, to it's Rage and Ma|lignity. And this they are loudly called upon to do, as they will an&s;wer it to GOD and their Coun|try. For GOD cannot but be highly provoked by &s;uch a complicated Scene of Vice and Wicked|ne&s;s, as the Gaming Table pre&s;ents. And there is
<PB N="25" REF="006939_0025_102A9C5E57BB60E0">&s;carce any other Vice to be found, &s;o va&s;tly perni|cious and ruinous to a Country, as this of Gaming. It draws after it a long and di&s;mal Train of other Crimes. Sharping, Robbing, Luxury, Drinking, Rioting, Lewdne&s;s, Duelling, with other &s;uch tri|fling Peccadilloes, commonly &s;erve and attend up|on this grand and ma&s;ter Vice. So va&s;tly prolific in Sin, and fruitful of Crimes, is this iniquitous Practice; and &s;o directly de&s;tructive of all good Manners and &s;ound Morality among a People!</P>
<P>IF therefore Gentlemen would but &s;eriou&s;ly con|&s;ider, and follow the Dictates of their Rea&s;on, this unrighteous Cu&s;tom would &s;oon be di&s;countenanced and di&s;carded among us. For certainly, above all Things, it is very prejudicial and di&s;graceful to a Gentleman. It degrades and brings him down to the Level of every Scoundrel; who, if he has the Ra&s;hne&s;s and Re&s;olution to venture a large Sum of Money upon the Ca&s;t of a Dye, immediately com|mences a Man of Spirit; and without any other &s;ingle good Quality to recommend him, is admitted as a fit Companion among Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Dignity and mo&s;t con&s;picuous Fortune. And be|&s;ides, the little Arts and mean Tricking of Gaming mu&s;t be quite below the Character of a true Gentle|man, who does not only act up to the &s;trict Rules of Virtue and Hone&s;ty, but is governed by a &s;till higher Principle of Honour; which implies a cer|tain Noblene&s;s and Genero&s;ity of Sentiment and Be|haviour, that &s;oars above every Appearance of Evil, and &s;corns, that the lea&s;t Stain &s;hould be ca&s;t upon, or Cavil rai&s;ed again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="006939_0026_102A9C618A8803B0">
THERE are indeed very good and whole&s;ome Laws at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;ting again&s;t this Practice, which only fail in the Execution. But whether there may not be &s;ome farther and more effectual Remedies found again&s;t it, I &s;hall leave to the Wi&s;|dom and Con&s;ideration of our Legi&s;lature to de|termine. I &s;hall only &s;ay that there is no reigning Evil among us at pre&s;ent, &s;o virulent and outragi|ous, and which &s;eems &s;o greatly to demand their Regard and healing Hand, as this of Gaming; nor any Thing, wherein they can do their Country a more real and &s;ub&s;tantial Service, than by putting an effectual Stop to it.</P>
<P>AS for my Part, I am deeply &s;en&s;ible of my Inability to do any great Good towards the Cure of this deadly Contagion.
