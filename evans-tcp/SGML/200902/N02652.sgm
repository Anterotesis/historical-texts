<P>_THERE is nothing more becoming ra|tional creatures, than a con&s;tant re|gard to the <HI>end</HI> of their &s;everal actions. It is the effect of true wi&s;|dom, to look beyond pre&s;ent things, forward to futurity, and inquire how they will terminate; and then to di|rect in the mo&s;t proper methods, to avoid a mi&s;chie|vous, and produce a happy period.</P>
<P>IT is the peculiar excellency of the Holy Scrip|tures, that they addre&s;s mankind in a manner thus &s;uitable to them&s;elves, and with a rational authority and maje&s;ty, &s;trike the human &s;oul, and command a&s;|&s;ent and reverence.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003144_0004_0FF07E247020FBE0">
THE P&s;alm immediately under our view is of this character, in which the Royal Prophet undertakes to vindicate the di&s;pen&s;ations of Divine Providence, from every objection of inju&s;tice, unfaithfulne&s;s, and in|equality, with which the &s;ons of profane&s;s might af|front and bla&s;pheme them. From the con&s;ideration of the righteou&s;ne&s;s and equity in the dealings of GOD mo&s;t high, to men upon the earth, the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> per&s;wades to the exerci&s;e of patience and holine&s;s, and directs us where to look for that real felicity, after which our eyes wander, and our hearts ince&s;&s;antly pant. The in&s;pired rea&s;oner concludes with an ex|hortation, exciting all the &s;incerely pious, that they by no means be di&s;couraged from the &s;ervice of their Lord, and enforces the exhortation by &s;everal mo|tives and arguments. The la&s;t of the&s;e is, the <HI>dif|ferent ENDS</HI> of the <HI>righteous</HI> and the <HI>wicked.</HI> Both the righteous and the wicked mu&s;t <HI>come to an end;</HI> For <HI>it is appointed unto all men once to die,</HI> and <HI>what man is he that liveth, and &s;hall not &s;ee death?</HI> But how <HI>wide</HI> and <HI>di&s;tant</HI> are the ends of the&s;e two very different parties of men? <HI>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the END of that man is peace. But the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors &s;hall be de&s;troyed together, the END of the wicked &s;hall be cut off.</HI></P>
<P>IN the words of my Text, there are three evident divi&s;ions, which I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h into <HI>de&s;criptive, doctrinal,</HI> and <HI>practical.</HI> The&s;e I &s;hall con&s;ider in their order.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>de&s;criptive;</HI> in which, we have the <HI>CHA|RACTER of the good man: PERFECT and UP|RIGHT. Mark the perfect man, &amp; behold the upright.</HI> The&s;e two terms, <HI>Perfection &amp; Uprightne&s;s,</HI> are a &s;hort, but a mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive character of an heir to caele&s;tial and unfading glories. They are a very compendious and brief epitomie of the heart and life of a &s;incere chri&s;tian: The fair lines of his character are here drawn, but in miniature, exact, and elegant. PERFECT and UPRIGHT: Perhaps, on the one hand, &s;ome would confine the meaning too clo&s;e, and take both the words to &s;ignify the &s;ame
<PB N="3" REF="003144_0005_0FF07E28E2A6C210">thing. Like <HI>Pharoah's</HI> dreams, they will &s;ay, <HI>the words are one, and the interpretation is one.</HI></P>
<P>OTHERS may perhaps &s;train them too far, and be willing to make a devout remark, which however it may entertain the Fancy, and be true in it &s;elf, per|haps may not have the weight of a demon&s;tration with the judgment, as being otherwi&s;e than <HI>prettily</HI> deduced from this immediate text. PERFECT, &s;ay they, that is <HI>internally</HI> holy; UPRIGHT, that is <HI>externally</HI> religious. It is, without doubt a true character of a &s;ervant of GOD, that he is holy both in heart and life; but whether the two branches of my Text point mo&s;t accurately at the&s;e two parts of &s;anctifi|cation, I &s;hall not here pretend to determine.</P>
<P>BUT that I may con&s;ider the words in a &s;uitable latitude and clearne&s;s, I &s;hall &s;how how they appear to me, in a more particular an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, <HI>WHAT is the PERFECTION which good men attain to in this life?</HI></P>
<P>IN di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this enquiry I &s;hall &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">I. Negatively. <HI>BY the word PERFECT in the text we are not to under&s;tand SINLESS Perfection.</HI> This is a degree of felicity not attainable by men, while they dwell in <HI>this pre&s;ent evil world.</HI> Of <HI>na|tural</HI> men, it is &s;trictly true, what we read, in P&s;al. XIV. 3. <HI>They are ALL gone a&s;ide, they are ALTOGETHER become filthy; There is NONE that doth good, no NOT ONE.</HI> And even of tho&s;e <HI>renewed by the SPIRIT of our GOD,</HI> it is as infallibly certain, I. Joh. i. 8. <HI>If we &s;ay we have NO SIN, we deceive our &s;elves, &amp; the truth is not in us.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED if we take perfection in the <HI>rigid &s;en&s;e</HI> of the word, it means &s;omething beyond what any <HI>created Being</HI> may a&s;&s;ume to it &s;elf; <HI>&s;upremely and divinely good.</HI> And in this re&s;pect, &s;urely <HI>there is none good but one, that is, GOD,</HI> Mat. XIX. 17.</P>
<P>BUT in a <HI>larger &s;en&s;e,</HI> moral perfection is applied to <HI>Creatures,</HI> and &s;ignifies <HI>a &s;tate entirely free from all &s;in.</HI> Such is the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the holy Angels, the&s;e &s;ons of perfection, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of un&s;ullied purity: And &s;uch is the <HI>honour of all the Saints,</HI> in
<PB N="4" REF="003144_0006_0FF07E2C0EA7C908">the con&s;ecrated man&s;ions above. There, in a mo&s;t exalted &s;en&s;e, they <HI>&s;tand PERFECT and compleat in ALL the will of</HI> GOD; and are mo&s;t emphatically called, <HI>the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made PERFECT.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, in this world, alas, it is far otherwi&s;e: For <HI>there is not a ju&s;t man upon earth, that doeth good, and &s;inneth not,</HI> Eccle&s;. vii. 10. This is a truth very ea&s;y to be proved from <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> from <HI>&s;cripture,</HI> from <HI>example,</HI> and from our own unhappy <HI>experience.</HI></P>
<P>WAS there ever a <HI>meer man,</HI> upon earth, &s;ince the fall of ADAM, that had a perfect <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> of the Law of GOD. It reaches to <HI>every action</HI> of life; to <HI>every word</HI> we &s;peak or <HI>ought</HI> to &s;peak; to <HI>every thought</HI> in our minds, or that <HI>&s;hould</HI> be there. It <HI>forbids</HI> &s;in at <HI>all times,</HI> and there is <HI>no &s;ea&s;on</HI> but there is &s;ome <HI>particular duty</HI> which it commands and exacts. In a word, <HI>the commandment is exceeding broad:</HI> &s;o <HI>broad,</HI> that the mind of no man, weakned and ob&s;cured by the fall, can ever &s;o much as fully <HI>under&s;tand</HI> it. It is plain then, if no man can have a compleat under&s;tanding of the divine law, he can|not fully <HI>practi&s;e</HI> it: For it is fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>know</HI> in order to <HI>do</HI> our duty. Thus DAVID admires, P&s;al. xix. 7. <HI>The Law of the LORD is PERFECT</HI>&mdash;and no wonder then, he exclaims, ver. 12. <HI>Who can UN|DERSTAND his Errors? clean&s;e thou me from &s;ecret faults.</HI> Thus we &s;ee <HI>rea&s;on</HI> gives it, that as the law of GOD is of too wide a compa&s;s to be <HI>fully compre|hended</HI> by &s;inful man; &s;o, by con&s;equence, it cannot be <HI>compleatly practi&s;ed,</HI> any more than <HI>ignorance</HI> can be the <HI>mother</HI> of rational <HI>devotion.</HI> To this we may &s;ubjoyn <HI>another</HI> argument, namely, that did we fully under&s;tand the moral commands, yet <HI>no man perfect|ly comes up to what he knows.</HI></P>
<P>WHO among the pre&s;uming &s;ons of men, after he has performed <HI>one</HI> &s;ingle duty, dares look back on it and appeal to GOD, that he &s;ees no <HI>&s;inful defect</HI> in it, for which he de&s;ires a pardon? Not one among the deluded mortals, that boa&s;t a perfection in this life, dares venture upon this tryal; and truly if they did, what would it prove, but their impudence and
<PB N="5" REF="003144_0007_0FF08599023FA730">vain conceit? <HI>GOD I thank thee,</HI> &s;aid the proud Pha|ri&s;ee, while he &s;tood and care&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and run the in&s;olent di&s;parity, <HI>GOD I thank thee, that I am not as other men, &mdash; or even as this publican.</HI></P>
<P>SURELY if any mortal might have a&s;&s;erted per|fection in this life, who would have been more likely than the admirable <HI>PAUL,</HI> who was the holie&s;t a|mong the mo&s;t holy, and <HI>came not behind the very chief of the Apo&s;tles.</HI> Yet this is the very man, whom the HOLY GHOST &s;elects out, to in&s;pire his moving lan|guage with tho&s;e pathetick and mournful &s;entiments, which flow through the vii. Chap. to the <HI>Romans,</HI> &s;ee from the 14. ver. <HI>For we know that the law is &s;piritual, but I am carnal, &s;old under &s;in. For that which I do, I allow not; for what I would that I do not; but what I hate, that do I.&mdash;For I know, that in me (that is in my fle&s;h) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is pre&s;ent with me, but to perform that which is good I find not. For the good which I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.&mdash;I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is pre&s;ent with me. &mdash; I &s;ee another law in my members warring again&s;t the law of my mind, and bringing me into cap|tivity to the law of &s;in, which is in my members. O wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death!</HI> And is this indeed PAUL? the devout, the laborious, the mo&s;t excellent PAUL! the very &s;ame who could tri|umph in tho&s;e harmonious and gallant periods of in|&s;piration, II. Cor. xi. from the 21 ver.&mdash;<HI>Where in &s;oever any is bold, I am bold al&s;o. Are they Hebrews? &s;o am I: are they I&s;raelites? &s;o am I: are they the &s;eed of Abraham? &s;o am I: are they mini&s;ters of CHRIST? I am more: in labours more abundant, in &s;tripes above mea&s;ure, in pri&s;ons more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty &s;tripes &s;ave one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I &s;toned, thrice I &s;uffered &s;hipwrack; a night and a day have I been in the deep: In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in
<PB N="6" REF="003144_0008_0FF0859BAAB1CF40">the wilderne&s;s, in perils in the &s;ea, in perils among fal&s;e brethren; In wearine&s;s and painfulne&s;s, in watchings, often, in hunger and thir&s;t, in fa&s;tings often, in cold and nakedne&s;s. Be&s;ides tho&s;e things which are with|out, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.</HI> Who would imagine that the&s;e two, are the de&s;criptions of the &s;ame per&s;on! That he who <HI>was</HI> &s;o excellent, and <HI>did</HI> &s;o much, &s;hould cry out, <HI>Oh! the body of death!</HI> Yet, this is he; the great <HI>Paul,</HI> the renowned doctor of the <HI>Gentibes.</HI> By choo&s;ing out this di&s;tingui&s;hed Hero of Chri&s;tianity, to fill his tongue with the lamentation of &s;in polluting all his duties, the HOLY SPIRIT &s;eems to have pitch|ed upon the fitte&s;t per&s;on in the world, to &s;top the mouth of gain&s;ayers. For when a character &s;o great and exalted as that of the Apo&s;tle PAUL, owns the blemi&s;hes of &s;in, what petty mortal pre&s;umes to &s;tand up, and boa&s;t his &s;uperiour attainments? The Man, who drove on unrivalled through the race of Chri&s;ti|anity, and flung even the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves at an humble di&s;tance; to hear his confe&s;&s;ions of defect and &s;in: with what pity, and contempt, and indignation mu&s;t we hear a grovelling &s;et of Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, pour out their ab&s;urdities and non&s;en&s;e, in &s;elf-applau&s;es at their own more untarni&s;hed Holine&s;s? None of them ven|ters to &s;ay, <HI>He him&s;elf</HI> has attained Perfection; but they all it &s;eems agree together, that it is &s;cattered, in|vi&s;ibly, &s;omewhere among their conceited numbers.&mdash;<HI>No doubt they are the people, and</HI> Perfection <HI>&s;hall die with them.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>As there has been enough &s;aid to confute this vain and arogant opinion, of a &s;inle&s;s perfection attainable in this life, &s;o the objections and cavils again&s;t the true Doctrine in this re&s;pect, may be as ea&s;ily obvia|ted and overthrown. It happens very uncomfortably for the a&s;&s;erters of Perfection, that all the texts they bring to e&s;tabli&s;h their error, lie &s;o near other texts which explain them in a different &s;en&s;e, that a man mu&s;t be very &s;en&s;ibly <HI>given up to &s;trong delu&s;ions</HI> before he can <HI>believe</HI> &s;o evident <HI>a lie.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003144_0009_0FF085A007D2F9B8">
Do the <HI>Scriptures call &s;ome men perfect?</HI> it happens very well for our doctrine, that there is not one meer man called &s;o, but &s;ome &s;in of his is al&s;o recorded, to prevent mi&s;takes about the matter. Was <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. vi. 9.</NOTE> NOAH <HI>a ju&s;t man, &amp; PERFECT in his generations?</HI> This &s;ame NOAH, we are informed, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. ix. 20, 21.</NOTE> lay <HI>drunk</HI> and <HI>uncovered in his tent.</HI> Was ASA'S <HI>heart PERFECT with the Lord all his days.</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2. Chron. xv. 17.</NOTE> In the very next Chapter four of his Crimes are tran&s;mitted down to po&s;terity. Did HEZEKIAH <HI>walk before GOD with a PERFECT heart,</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">2 Kin. xx. 3.</NOTE> yet did the &s;in of HEZEKIAH <HI>bring wrath upon him and upon Judah, and upon Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Even our Fa|ther ABRAHAM him&s;elf, to whom the command was given, <HI>walk before me and be thou PERFECT,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xvii. 1.</NOTE> even HE, the faithful <HI>Abraham,</HI> failed in that very grace wherein lay his chiefe&s;t excellency. He was twice over reproved by a heathen, for a crime into which he was betrayed through diffidence and infide|lity. See <HI>Gen.</HI> xii.12&mdash;. xx.&mdash;. In a word, let the pretenders to perfection, look over the Scriptures, and produce from thence their meer man without &s;in.</P>
<P>PERHAPS they will give up their argument from example, and lie intrenched rather under &s;ome <HI>pre|cept</HI> which commands perfection. They will frame their plea thus: Are we not plainly <HI>commanded to be perfect?</HI> Now is it rea&s;onable to imagine that we &s;hould be required to perform an impracticable duty? There needs no other an&s;wer to the objection, than to cite the very text they allude to, Mat. v. 48. <HI>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.</HI> No man can under&s;tand this literally; or take it otherwi&s;e, than as a command to endeavour after perfection, as much as ever he can. And that this &s;hould be our <HI>endeavour</HI> is agreed by all: But that ever it will be our attainment in this World, &s;till remains to be proved.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t argument I &s;hall take notice of, urged by the a&s;&s;erters of perfect holine&s;s in this Life, is per|verted
<PB N="8" REF="003144_0010_0FF085A1961A5340">from &s;ome texts, which &s;eem to a carele&s;s eye, to look that way: But the&s;e too, all lie near &s;uch places, as very effectually explain their meaning. In the Epi&s;tle of <HI>James,</HI> Chap. iii. 2. we are told, <HI>If any man offend not in word, the &s;ame is a perfect man.</HI> It is well however that the very words before are, <HI>In many things we offend all.</HI> So that there can be no difficulty in this text. But the mo&s;t noted pa&s;&s;ages which the&s;e men produce, are in the 1&s;t. Epi&s;tle of <HI>John,</HI> particularly, Chap. iii. 9. <HI>He that is born of GOD &s;inneth not.</HI> Methinks this Epi&s;tle of all others, &s;hould be the mo&s;t unlikely to find favour with the&s;e men. The fir&s;t chapter of it, is directly armed to overthrow their tottering foundation. See 8 and 10. ver|&s;es. <HI>If we &s;ay that we have no &s;in, we deceive our &s;elves, and the truth is not in us. If we &s;ay that we have not &s;inned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</HI> To conclude, There is no way for the&s;e men to prove their point out of this Epi&s;tle without making the in|&s;pired author contradict him&s;elf. I &s;hall here di&s;mi&s;s this point, and make &s;ome <HI>po&s;itive an&s;wer</HI> to the Que&s;tion. <HI>What is that perfection good men attain to in this life,</HI> &s;poken of in the Text?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT implies INTENTIONAL Perfection.</HI> In this particular the text explains it &s;elf, and <HI>perfection</HI> means <HI>uprightne&s;s,</HI> and &s;incerity. <HI>Mark the PERFECT man, and behold the UPRIGHT.</HI> If good men are not <HI>po&s;itively</HI> perfect, yet they are <HI>intentionally</HI> &s;o; and though they can never in this life fully <HI>acquire</HI> this felicity, yet they are always <HI>endeavouring</HI> after it. So the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> at the &s;ame time calls him&s;elf <HI>perfect,</HI> and yet &s;ays he <HI>has not attained</HI> to perfection. Phil. iii. 12, 13, 14, 15. <HI>NOT as though I had already AT|TAINED, or were already PERFECT, but I follow af|ter it.&mdash;Brethren, I COUNT NOT my &s;elf to have appre|hended. But this one thing I do, forgetting the things which are behind; and reaching forth unto tho&s;e things which are before, I pre&s;s forward toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of GOD in CHRIST Je&s;us. Let US therefore, as many as be PERFECT, be THUS MINDED.</HI> This was the Go&s;pel preached by
<PB N="9" REF="003144_0011_0FF07DB14C83EF08"><HI>Paul,</HI> that though he had <HI>not arrived</HI> to perfection in the <HI>&s;trict &s;en&s;e</HI> of the Word, yet, while he <HI>pre&s;|&s;ed</HI> after it, he might in the &s;en&s;e of the Go&s;pel come into the number of <HI>as many as were perfect.</HI></P>
<P>AND the &s;ame conclu&s;ion rears it &s;elf, on a compa|ri&s;on of <HI>Job</HI> i. 1. with <HI>Job.</HI> ix. 20. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Job</HI> is called a <HI>PERFECT and UPRIGHT man, one that feared GOD, and e&s;chewed evil.</HI> And in the other <HI>Job</HI> him&s;elf pronounces, <HI>If I ju&s;tify my &s;elf, my own mouth &s;hall condemn me; if I &s;ay I am 'PERFECT', it &s;hall al&s;o prove me perver&s;e.</HI> Hence it plainly follows, that <HI>Job's perfection</HI> was only <HI>uprightne&s;s,</HI> and &s;ignified no more than that he <HI>feared GOD,</HI> and <HI>e&s;chewed evil;</HI> that is, <HI>endeavoured after perfection.</HI></P>
<P>AND this is a perfection which belongs to all good men. They DESIRE to be perfect; their <HI>de&s;ire</HI> forms it&s;elf into a &s;ettled PURPOSE to pur&s;ue it; their <HI>pur|po&s;e</HI> produces an ENDEAVOUR; their <HI>endeavour</HI> de|mon&s;trates their SINCERITY, and their <HI>&s;incerity</HI> is a <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> PERFECTION.</P>
<P>INDEED if we con&s;ider how &s;incerity operates in a good man, we &s;hall ob&s;erve &s;ome <HI>re&s;emblance</HI> of a <HI>real perfection</HI> in it. The regards of a holy Man to the new Covenant, flame with the pure&s;t ardor, and pro|ceed with a direct integrity. He is entirely for GOD, and aims at his glory, with a &s;ingle eye, and an up|right heart. Though he obeys the Law of GOD <HI>but in part,</HI> yet he obeys <HI>every part</HI> of it: That is; tho' he cannot <HI>fully</HI> come up to <HI>any</HI> &s;ingle precept of it, yet, there is <HI>no</HI> &s;ingle precept, which he does not <HI>endeavour</HI> to come up to. So that though the <HI>obedi|ence of faith</HI> is not <HI>&s;inle&s;s,</HI> yet it is <HI>univer&s;al;</HI> and this both in regard to the <HI>per&s;on</HI> obeying, and the <HI>law</HI> o|beyed.</P>
<P>IT is univer&s;al in re&s;pect of the <HI>per&s;on obeying;</HI> becau&s;e he ob&s;erves it with his whole &s;pirit, &s;oul, and body, and &s;ubmits it both <HI>externally</HI> and <HI>internally.</HI> Thus runs the exhortation of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Jam.</HI> iv. 8. <HI>Clean&s;e your hands ye &s;inners, and purify your hearts ye double-minded.</HI> The <HI>hands</HI> and <HI>heart</HI> here &s;pecified, have a plain reference to the two con&s;tituant parts of man, <HI>body</HI> and <HI>&s;oul.</HI></P>

IT is the care of the man of GOD, to pre&s;ent his BODY as well as <HI>his &s;pirit a living &s;acrifice to GOD;</HI> and the &s;everal <HI>members</HI> that &s;upport and a|dorn it, he improves as the members of his LORD JESUS CHRIST. The &s;everal <HI>&s;en&s;es</HI> of his Body too, the holy man dedicates to the GOD who contrived their curious con&s;titution, and maintains their various powers of action and delight. His <HI>EYES di&s;cover</HI> the image of the Deity clearly re|flected from the gla&s;s of nature, and the will of GOD more clearly revealed in the mirrour of his word; and are then <HI>lifted up</HI> to heaven, in admiration and prai&s;e. His <HI>EARS</HI> catch the glad tydings of the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> and attend devoutly at the &s;acred place of thunder; and not only &s;o, but they endeavour to learn &s;omething forGOD in the mo&s;t trifling or vain <HI>Company.</HI> His Food reli&s;hes upon his <HI>PALATE</HI> with a finer flavour, and a &s;tronger gu&s;t, when <HI>he eats to the glory of GOD,</HI> and therein <HI>ta&s;tes that the LORD is gracious.</HI> The Fields do not breathe their odors upon him, and render the air about him a perfume, without his articulating the <HI>&s;cented</HI> breath in &s;ounds of gratitude and thanksgiving. He does with his might, what his <HI>HANDS</HI> find to do, and his <HI>FEET</HI> are directed in right paths, while, like his JESUS upon Earth, he <HI>walks about</HI> con&s;tantly <HI>do|ing good.</HI> He calls upon his <HI>TONGUE, awake my glory</HI> to prai&s;e the <HI>LORD:</HI> And to what end, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> have I my <HI>voice,</HI> but to prai&s;e thee <HI>aloud with joyful LIPS.</HI> In fine, the whole <HI>body</HI> of the good man, and all the <HI>members</HI> and <HI>&s;en&s;es</HI> of it, are dedicated to the &s;er|vice of GOD, and employed in the &s;acred exerci&s;e.</P>

<P>AND if we con&s;ider the <HI>LAW obeyed,</HI> the obedience is <HI>univer&s;al</HI> in regard to that too.

THIS is the picture of the <HI>PERFECT</HI> and <HI>UP|RIGHT man,</HI> &s;poken of in our Text; and indeed none but he, is <HI>univer&s;al</HI> in his obedience to the di|vine law. The <HI>bypocrite</HI> is quite of <HI>another character,</HI> forever <HI>partial</HI> in his obedience, and &s;till rolls &s;ome beloved lu&s;t as a &s;weet mor&s;el under his tongue, which he will by no means part with. Nor can the mo&s;t painted among that unhappy generation be de&s;|cribed any further than he, Mar. vi. 20. <HI>He did MANY things. Many</HI> things; not <HI>all.</HI> But &s;o much for the fir&s;t thing, that the good man is <HI>inten|tionally</HI> perfect. To proceed,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>HE is perfect by IMPUTATION.</HI> And in this &s;en&s;e, the believer is perfect in the <HI>&s;tricte&s;t</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word, as it can be applied to <HI>creatures: Fully,</HI> and <HI>completely</HI> perfect. The imputation of CHRIST'S righteou&s;ne&s;s, gives the faithful a claim to a perfecti|on without &s;pot or blemi&s;h. The true Chri&s;tian, holy as he <HI>is,</HI> and perfect as he <HI>endeavours to be,</HI> forever renounces <HI>his own righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and &s;tands <HI>perfect be|fore GOD</HI> in the <HI>imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of the Mediator. This is mo&s;t emphatically expre&s;&s;ed in that humble de|votion and ardor of our Apo&s;tle, Phil. iii. 7, 8, 9. <HI>What things are gain to me I count lo&s;s for CHRIST. Yea, doubt|le&s;s, and I count all things but lo&s;s for the excellency of the knowledge of CHRIST JESUS my Lord &mdash; and do count them but dung that I may win CHRIST, and be found in him, not having my OWN righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the law, but THAT which is THROUGH FAITH in CHRIST, the RIGHTEOUSNESS which is of GOD BY FAITH.</HI> In like manner the ignorance and vain-conceit of tho&s;e who go about to e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own,</HI> are detected by the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, Rom. x. 4. <HI>For CHRIST is the end of the law for RIGHTEOUSNESS to every one that believeth.</HI> But it is not ea&s;y to expre&s;s any thing more plainly than this matter is declared in the <HI>fifth</HI> chapter to the <HI>Romans.</HI> See from the 12 ver&s;e, where the Apo&s;tle treats this &s;ubject at large. I am not concerned to know what &s;ubtilties the <HI>unlearned and un&s;table</HI> may u&s;e to <HI>wre&s;t</HI> this pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Paul's</HI> Epi&s;tle:

<P>IN &s;hort, this <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> by the <HI>imputed Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of CHRIST, is &s;o evidently a&s;&s;erted and ex|plained in the holy writings, that a man mu&s;t be more cunning than ordinary; who can per&s;wade them to a different confe&s;&s;ion. No doubt the various <HI>Racks</HI> of the <HI>Critick,</HI> or the <HI>Commentator</HI> (men who have a wonderful knack to <HI>illu&s;trate away the meaning</HI> of the cleare&s;t texts, and <HI>explain them into non&s;en&s;e</HI>) no doubt, but the <HI>artificial engines</HI> of the&s;e men may pervert the plaine&s;t words, and extort half a dozen contradictions from every ver&s;e in the New Te&s;tament: But how|ever their ingenuity may plea&s;e them&s;elves, and grati|fy a few Gentlemen of their own opinions, yet they will never be able to convince the &s;erious inquirer after truth, or weaken the authority of the in&s;pired oracles; to a mind at the &s;ame time devout and rational.</P>
<P>IF then the Scriptures declare the <HI>rightcou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST imputed to the true believer,</HI> no wonder he is called the <HI>PERFECT MAN.</HI> This is the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing glory of the &s;ons of GOD among men; and this honour have all the &s;aints.

Not an angel in the imperial city above &s;parkles in the circle of &s;o divine a &s;plendour; nor does the whole con&s;tellation of morning &s;tars blend their beams in an equal glory.</P>
<P>STAND &s;till then, <HI>Mark the PERFECT man! and behold the UPRIGHT! Take notice</HI> and <HI>ob&s;erve</HI> his

<P>WE come now to the SECOND main thing in the Text, which may properly enough be called the DOCTRINAL <HI>part</HI> of it.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>THE perfect and upright man has PEACE in his END.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a great mi&s;take to imagine that there is no peace in the <HI>way</HI> of a true Believer; for certainly his <HI>WAYS are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all</HI> his <HI>paths are peace;</HI> Prov. iii. 17. But it is &s;urely a much great|er error to &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>end</HI> of his way is not peaceful and happy. Nay, <HI>the END of that man is PEACE;</HI> a <HI>PEACE pa&s;&s;ing all under&s;tanding,</HI> and a <HI>peace</HI> without any <HI>end</HI> at all.</P>
<P>BUT for the clearer illu&s;tration of this matter; we may here make a <HI>conce&s;&s;ion,</HI> and acknowledge that <HI>the death of believers may &s;ometimes be attended with unea&s;y and grievous circum&s;tances.</HI> When we a&s;&s;ert the peaceful end of the good man, we do not always mean to bani&s;h from his death-bed, every thing of a frightful and gha&s;tly a&s;pect; and &s;pread &s;un-&s;hine and &s;erenity over the gloomy vale. No; the pious man may die in &s;uch a manner, as to wear quite a <HI>different face</HI> from that of <HI>peace,</HI> in the un&s;anctified eye. All may &s;eem to end in a tragedy; his &s;un may &s;et in a cloud; and the grave may open a hideous mouth, and gape upon him black and di&s;mal. The righteous and unerring Providence of GOD in this World, makes no di&s;tingui&s;hing and con&s;tant difference between the holy and impious. <HI>For we &s;ee that WISE MEN DIE, likewi&s;e the FOOL and the BRUITISH PERSON peri&s;h. And HOW dieth the WISE MAN? as the FOOL,</HI> Eccl. ii. 14, 15, 16. <HI>The WISE MAN&mdash;and the FOOL&mdash;I my &s;elf perceived that ONE EVENT happened to them all. Then &s;aid I to
<PB N="15" REF="003144_0017_0FF085B475A801F8">my &s;elf, as it happeneth to the FOOL, &s;o it happeneth unto ME; and why was I then more WISE?</HI></P>
<P>THESE equal di&s;tributious of providence, in regard to the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t, for ever check the daring pride of the men who would judge of their neigh|bours uprightne&s;s, by the events that befall them. It is a vain arrogance to judge a man's e&s;tate in the <HI>other world,</HI> by the manner of his expiration <HI>here:</HI> And it is a vain pre&s;umption to expect that all good men &s;hould die with the <HI>outward &s;igns of peace,</HI> and basking in the vi&s;ible dawn of a future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour has warned us again&s;t the&s;e in|decent and uncharitable cen&s;ures, Luk. xiii. 1-5. <HI>There were pre&s;ent at that &s;ea&s;on, &s;ome that told him of the Galileans, who&s;e blood Pilate had mingled with the &s;acrifices: And Je&s;us an&s;wering, &s;aid unto them, &s;uppo&s;e ye that the&s;e Galileans were &s;inners above all the Galileans, becau&s;e they &s;uffered &s;uch things? I tell you, NAY: &mdash; Or tho&s;e eighteen, upon whom the tower of Siloam fell, and &s;lew them, think ye that they were &s;inners above all men which dwelt in Jeru&s;alem? I tell you, NAY:</HI>&mdash; Thus the death of good men may &s;ometimes look with an awful and &s;urprizing a&s;pect; far from peace and calm. They may <HI>die</HI> by <HI>ca&s;ualties;</HI> like tho&s;e &s;lain of <HI>Siloam:</HI> They may be <HI>afflicted</HI> with <HI>grievous di&s;ea&s;es;</HI> like the upright <HI>Job:</HI> they may be <HI>murdered</HI> by the <HI>cruelties of martyrdom;</HI> as the righteous <HI>Abel:</HI> or they may be <HI>&s;truck</HI> by the <HI>immediate hand of heaven;</HI> as the too-zealous <HI>Uzziah.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, what is mo&s;t of all dreadful, a good man may die in great dejection of mind: and in&s;tead of peace, his whole &s;oul may be in a tumult; and the &s;ound of war, may alarm his la&s;t moments. GOD may hide his face from him; and withdraw the &s;en&s;e of his love. The <HI>Devil</HI> may be let loo&s;e, and urge his on&s;ets with redoubled <HI>&s;ury, becau&s;e be knoweth that he hath but a &s;hort time.</HI> In a word, the good man may die with all po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tances of horror and angui&s;h, except an <HI>ab&s;olute de&s;pair.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="003144_0018_0FF085B860774780">
BUT is this any objection to the truth of the Doc|trine, <HI>The END of that man is PEACE?</HI> Surely no: even amid&s;t all the &s;huddering of this agony, and though the thundering tempe&s;t beat with the utmo&s;t outrage upon the departing &s;aint; yet is there peace and calm in it all. Faith &s;hews the heavenly calm of paradi&s;e, far-di&s;tant, behind this momentary tumult: and let the winds ri&s;e, the waves roar, and the &s;torm thicken and grow black in the cloudy at|mo&s;phere below: Yet above does the ether &s;hine ever clear and &s;erene; and the climate is eternally pure, and &s;oft, and indulgent. There the &s;un-beams play about without the lea&s;t &s;tain or ob&s;truction; but the whole ample &s;pace, &s;eems but one unbounded ocean of flame and glory. Nay, even all the pre&s;ent afflic|tion; the grief of &s;oul, and the pangs of death; it is all intended for the advantage of the good man; and &s;hall only promote his flight to the &s;miling regions, <HI>where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and the weary are at re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING made this <HI>conce&s;&s;ion,</HI> and con&s;idered the <HI>objection</HI> which might ari&s;e from it, I &s;hall now &s;how, <HI>HOW the END of the perfect and upright man is PEACE.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A good man dies in a STATE of PEACE and reconciliation to GOD.</HI> Sin has made a terrible controver&s;y between GOD and man; while man is become the rebel, and GOD the avenger. The de|plorable condition in which the fallen race of <HI>Adam</HI> &s;tand with relation to the holy GOD, is like that, Zach. xi. 8. &mdash; <HI>My &s;oul loathed them, and their &s;oul ab|horred me.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though the &s;tate of the unregenerate is thus unhappy and di&s;mal, while <HI>GOD holds them for his enemies:</HI> Yet it is much otherwi&s;e with true believers. The difference between GOD and them is made up. GOD is at <HI>peace</HI> with <HI>them,</HI> and <HI>they</HI> are <HI>reconciled</HI> to GOD. Rom. v. 1. <HI>Being ju&s;tified by faith, we have PEACE with GOD, through our Lord Je&s;us CHRIST.</HI> That ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Prince of peace,</HI> has <HI>made</HI> peace for us; He has <HI>bought</HI> it with his <HI>blood,</HI> and <HI>&s;ealed</HI> it to us by
<PB N="17" REF="003144_0019_0FF085BC818EC208">his <HI>holy Spirit.</HI> He has drawn up the <HI>articles</HI> of it, in his <HI>new and everla&s;ting Covenant;</HI> and &s;ettled it upon &s;trong foundations, forever fixed and immovea|ble. There it &s;tands like a mighty city, of the fine&s;t &s;ymmetry and proportion: <HI>divine wi&s;dom</HI> is the <HI>archi|tect; divine truth</HI> the <HI>ba&s;is,</HI> and it is <HI>&s;upported</HI> upon the <HI>pillars of omnipotence.</HI> Surely the death thus defend|ed and &s;ecured, cannot but be <HI>really</HI> peaceable and ble&s;&s;ed.

<P N="2">2.
