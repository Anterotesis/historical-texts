<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ROM. VII. 24.</HI></BIBL>
<P>O wretched Man that I am: who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this Death?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words are the doleful out|cry of one of the mo&s;t holy Men that ever lived: It is no le&s;s a Per&s;on than the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> that Great and Excellent Servant of Chri&s;t, who is here bitterly bemoaning him|&s;elf. In this his Self-lamentation Ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Matter</HI> of his Lamentation, or that which he complains of, Namely, <HI>The Body of Death in him:</HI> that's the <HI>Gravamen,</HI> the burden of his holy Soul. By the <HI>Body of Death</HI> is meant <HI>Inhe|rent Corruption,</HI> which he &s;ometimes calls <HI>Sin, In|dwelling Sin,</HI> a <HI>Law of Sin.</HI> &mdash; 'Tis called a <HI>Body,</HI> partly, becau&s;e it over&s;preads the <HI>whole Body</HI> of Man. <HI>Original Sin</HI> eats into the <HI>Body,</HI> &amp; diffu&s;es
<PB N="2" REF="001336_0003_0FB2885AB51A48B8">
it &s;elf thro' every Member thereof, and em|ploys them as in&s;truments to act by. Partly, becau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts of many <HI>Members</HI> or Parts. A <HI>Body</HI> is made up of many <HI>Members</HI> united one to another. Thus <HI>Original Sin</HI> has a great many <HI>Members</HI> and Branches: 'tis a <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> of Corrupti|on, a Collection of Lu&s;ts. The <HI>Members</HI> of this <HI>Body of Sin</HI> are far more numerous than the Members of our <HI>Humane Bodies:</HI> for there are <HI>many Lu&s;ts</HI> that have Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and act by, each &s;ingle <HI>Member</HI> of the <HI>Body.</HI> There is but <HI>One Tongue</HI> in the Body, yet the Sins of the <HI>Tongue</HI> are numberle&s;s.</P>
<P>Tis called a <HI>Body of Death,</HI> Partly, becau&s;e it makes men <HI>Dead</HI> unto and in Spiritual Duties. As for Natural men it makes them altogether <HI>Dead</HI> unto Spiritural Duties; either they per|form them not at all, or they di&s;charge them in a manner wholly <HI>Dead</HI> and Lifele&s;s. As for the Regenerate, Indwelling Sin cau&s;es in them a great deal of Aver&s;ene&s;s to and <HI>Deadne&s;s</HI> in Religious Duties; they do not di&s;charge Du|ties with that Life, Vigour and Activity which they ought to do; and this is from the dead|ning Influence of <HI>Indwelling Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Again, It is called a <HI>Body of Death,</HI> becau&s;e it tends to and i&s;&s;ues in <HI>Death.</HI> Original Sin is a <HI>Deadly</HI> Principle. As for the Godly, it brings <HI>Temporal Death</HI> upon them: Becau&s;e they have <HI>Sin</HI> in them, they have the Seed of <HI>Death</HI> in them. As for the Unregenerate, this Indwelling
<PB N="3" REF="001336_0004_0FB2885C9626AF50">
Sin does bring upon them <HI>Eternal Death:</HI> It cea&s;es not till it has accompli&s;hed their Ever|la&s;ting De&s;truction. 'Tis this <HI>Body of Death</HI> whereof the Apo&s;tle complains, which is the fir&s;t thing Ob&s;ervable.</P>
<P N="2">2. His complaint concerning it, <HI>O Wretched Man that I am:</HI> He cryes out and complains of him&s;elf as <HI>Wretched</HI> on the account of this Body of Death. <HI>Wretched,</HI> does not &s;ignify Cur&s;ed or Unhappy, but Weary and Tired: like a man that had fought till &s;pent, and ready to &s;ink, unle&s;s &s;ome One come in to his help and &s;up|port.</P>
<P N="3">3. His earne&s;t De&s;ire of Deliverance from it, <HI>Who &s;hall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</HI> This is not the Voice of one <HI>Doubting</HI> of Deli|verance, or at a lo&s;s where to go for Delive|rance; for he was &s;ure of Deliverance in due time, and knew from whom his Deliverance would come; as the next Ver&s;e &s;hows, <HI>I thank God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI> It is therefore the Voice of one that longs for, that breathes and pants after Deliverance.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCT. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI></HI> is one matter of a Godly Man's Lamentation, and what he much longs to be Delivered from.</HEAD>
<P>This Doctrine may be &s;poken to under three Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001336_0005_0FB2885E0D9A77B8">PROP. I. <HI>Every Godly Man has Sin dwelling in him.</HI> All men have a corrupt Nature handed down to them from our fir&s;t Parents. They are <HI>Conceived in Sin and brought forth in Iniquity,</HI> P&s;al. 51.5. This <HI>Sin of mans Nature</HI> is not perfectly removed in the Work of Regeneration and Sanctification: The be&s;t of Men have the <HI>Re|mainders of Corruption</HI> in them as long as they continue in this World. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> was, it may be, inferior to no meer man as to holi|ne&s;s of Heart and Life, and yet he does in our Text and Context confe&s;s that he had Sin dwel|ling and &s;tirring in him. It is <HI>Self-Delu&s;ion</HI> to think or &s;ay, <HI>That we have no Sin,</HI> 1 Joh. 1.8. There is no <HI>Sinle&s;s Per&s;on</HI> on this &s;ide Heaven: and therefore the <HI>Mortification of Sin,</HI> is a work wherein Saints are to be engaged, all the dayes of their Lives.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>This Indwelling Sin is One matter of a Godly Man's Lamentation.</HI> The renewed Soul of the Apo&s;tle does in the Text Sigh &amp; Groan over the remainders of Sin in him&punc; Herein he is a Pattern of all true Believers; every holy man is like him in this point.</P>
<P>Two things may here be Enquired into.</P>
<P>Q. 1. <HI>How do the Godly Lament Indwelling Sin?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>Principally.</HI> The Body of Death is the <HI>Chief Matter</HI> of their Lamentation. There is nothing which a Godly Man does more bitterly bewail than this <HI>Plague of his own Heart.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="001336_0006_0FB28860F515D030">1. He Laments this more than any <HI>Outward Affliction. Corruption within</HI> cau&s;es more heavi|ne&s;s and &s;orrow in his Spirit, than all <HI>Troubles Without.</HI> This we may &s;ee Verifyed in the A|po&s;tle <HI>Paul:</HI> He was a man exerci&s;ed with as various &amp; great <HI>Calamities</HI> as mo&s;t men. Scarce any, if any, did &s;uffer more than he did in his time: he him&s;elf gives us a Summary account of his many &amp; grievous &s;ufferings, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.23, 24, 25, 26, 27. Now tho' he was a Man of &s;uch <HI>Sufferings,</HI> yet we do not find that he com|plained under them: he never cryed out of his &s;harp Afflictions bemoaning him&s;elf on the ac|count of them. No, in&s;tead of lamenting them he <HI>Rejoyced</HI> and <HI>Gloried</HI> in them; they were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> matter of his <HI>Triumph,</HI> not of his <HI>Sorrow.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> now, when he gives us an account of the <HI>Body of Death and Sin</HI> in him, he cryes out, <HI>O wretched man that I am!</HI> The <HI>Body of Death</HI> is a Saint's <HI>greate&s;t Burden:</HI> He groans more under the weight of that, than of any burden of Affliction. Hence it is that he is willing that God &s;hould lay any <HI>Afflictions</HI> upon him which may mortify his <HI>Corruptions:</HI> He is content God &s;hould u&s;e the &s;harpe&s;t <HI>Remedies</HI> that may kill his Lu&s;ts. Let God take away the Health and Strength of his <HI>Body,</HI> let God do any thing with him, <HI>If it may &s;lay Sin, he is &s;atisfyed.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He Laments this more than any <HI>Actual Sin. Acts of Sin</HI> are to be bewailed, but the <HI>Principle of Sin</HI> much more; And a Godly Man is in bit|terne&s;s
<PB N="6" REF="001336_0007_0FB2886856A35960">
of Spirit for his <HI>Actual Iniquities,</HI> but more for <HI>Original Sin.</HI> He grieves that he has com|mitted any Sin, but he grieves more that there is &s;uch a corrupt heart in him which carryes him to &s;uch Sins. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is much wor&s;e than any <HI>Actual Sin.</HI> The Lu&s;ts of the heart are great|er Evils than the <HI>Sins of the Life,</HI> as &s;hall pre&s;ently be proved. There is therefore more cau&s;e to bewail Sin in us, than Sin acted by us. Accor|dingly a Godly Man, is by his <HI>Actual Sins</HI> led up to the Con&s;ideration of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> and he Principally Mourns over that. When <HI>David</HI> had been guilty of Murder and Adultery, he bit|terly bewailed tho&s;e horrid Sins; but his Peni|tent Eye did e&s;pecially look to, and weep over that <HI>Vile Heart</HI> from whence they proceeded, P&s;al. 51.5. <HI>Behold, I was &s;hapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me. Behold!</HI> Says he. He points his finger to, and takes &s;pecial notice of, his Natural Corruption: and tis as if he &s;hould have &s;aid, <Q>Ah Lord! What a Cur&s;ed and Sinful Nature have I that is prone to &s;uch Mon&s;trous Abominations?</Q> The vilene&s;s of his <HI>Heart</HI> was that which mo&s;tly aba&s;ed him. Thus the Apo&s;tle in the context makes a Peni|tent mention of the many <HI>Actings</HI> of Sin where|of he was guilty, but at length his mo&s;t bitter complaints are made again&s;t the body of Death, <HI>O wretched man that I am: who &s;hall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</HI> The &s;trength of his Sorrow is &s;pent on this: He &s;tops not till he
<PB N="7" REF="001336_0008_0FB2886AC34B9120">
comes to the <HI>Fountain head,</HI> and there he lyes down and weeps.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Godly do Lament Indwelling Sin <HI>Continually.</HI> This Body of Death lyes down with them, ri&s;es up with them, and accompa|nies them all the day long, and &s;o is an occa|&s;ion of their con&s;tant Lamentation. 'Tis as a <HI>Loath&s;ome Corps</HI> chained to them, which is the perpetual burden and abhorrence of their Souls. Every day they find it inclining and prompting them to Sin, deadning and indi&s;po&s;ing them to duty, and &s;o is a daily grief of Heart to them: by rea&s;on of this, <HI>they go Mourning to their Graves.</HI></P>
<P>So much for the fir&s;t Enquiry.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 2. <HI>Why do the Godly make Indwelling Sin the Matter of their Lamentation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> They have abundant <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> &s;o to do.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> directly oppo&s;es the <HI>whole Law of God.</HI> It is contrary not only to <HI>Some</HI> of Gods Commands, but to <HI>Every One</HI> of them. It is an Univer&s;al contrariety to the holy Law of God: It con&s;i&s;ts in an Aver&s;ation to <HI>Every thing</HI> that God requires, and an Inclination to <HI>Every thing</HI> that God forbids. There is an ab|&s;ence of <HI>All Good,</HI> and a fulne&s;s of <HI>All Evil</HI> in <HI>Original Sin.</HI> There are as <HI>many Lu&s;ts</HI> in In|dwelling Sin, as there are <HI>Laws</HI> in the Word of God: To every <HI>Law</HI> there is an oppo&s;ite <HI>Lu&s;t.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001336_0009_0FB2886C41912B38">
Does God require <HI>Faith?</HI> Oppo&s;ite to this is the Lu&s;t of <HI>Unbelief.</HI> Does He require <HI>Humi|lity?</HI> Oppo&s;ite to this is the <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> of <HI>Pride.</HI> Does he require <HI>Hope</HI> in His Mercy, mutual <HI>Forgivene&s;s, Patience</HI> under Trials, <HI>&amp;c?</HI> Oppo|&s;ite to the&s;e are the Lu&s;ts of <HI>De&s;pair, Revenge, Impatience,</HI> &amp;c. So that <HI>Original Sin</HI> is as exten|&s;ive as the holy Law of God: It is then di|rectly contrary to the whole Law of God in every part of it. In this re&s;pect it is far wor&s;e than any <HI>Actual Sin:</HI> for Actual Sins are di|rectly contrary to &s;ome particular Commands only. But Indwelling Sin is an <HI>Entire Body of Lu&s;ts,</HI> which is contrary to the <HI>Entire Body of Divine Laws.</HI> There is no Law, which Origi|nal Sin, does not in one branch or other, &s;tand in a direct Oppo&s;ition unto. It is there|fore called a <HI>Law of Sin,</HI> partly, becau&s;e it lyes in a parallel Oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Divine Law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is then a ju&s;t Matter of Lamen|tation. O how worthy is that <HI>Sin</HI> to be be|wailed which is &s;o <HI>Exceeding broad?</HI> If we are deeply to be humbled for every <HI>Act</HI> of Sin which tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the Law of God in &s;ome &s;ingle point, how much more for that <HI>Sin</HI> which tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the Law of God in all points? <HI>The more Laws</HI> are broken by a Sin, the <HI>more</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">hould be <HI>Lamented.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="9" REF="001336_0010_0FB2886E20857468">2. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is a principle of Cur&s;ed <HI>En|mity again&s;t God.</HI> The Mind as far as it is <HI>Carnal</HI> or Corrupt, is not only an <HI>Enemy</HI> to God, but al&s;o <HI>Enmity again&s;t God,</HI> Rom. 8.7. Nothing wor&s;e than this can be &s;aid of it. Hereby is pointed out to us that extream Antipathy a|gain&s;t God which there is in Original Sin. An <HI>Enemy</HI> may be reconciled to God, but <HI>Enmity</HI> can never be reconciled to Him: It is totally and implacably oppo&s;ite to the ble&s;&s;ed God. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> &s;ets it &s;elf again&s;t <HI>GOD</HI> to A&s;to|ni&s;hment: The dreadful Malignity of it again&s;t <HI>GOD</HI> we may &s;ee in that power which it has over many Ungodly men; it makes them to be <HI>Haters of God, Fighters again&s;t God, De|nyers of God:</HI> This Sin within, would, if it could, pull <HI>GOD</HI> from His Throne; yea, deprive <HI>GOD</HI> of His very Being: The Saints and Ser|vants of God have that within them which would do all this. And they do oftentimes ex|perience in &s;ome degree, the workings of this horrid Enmity again&s;t God in them&s;elves: There are mo&s;t <HI>Wicked, Bla&s;phemous, Athei&s;ti|cal thoughts</HI> which do &s;ometimes ari&s;e in their Hearts. They find Indwelling Sin many times prompting them to offer unto God the mo&s;t vile Affronts imaginable. Do they not &s;ome|times que&s;tion whether there be a <HI>GOD?</HI> whether the <HI>Scriptures</HI> be true? whether there be a divine <HI>Providence,</HI> and whether there be <HI>Future Rewards</HI> or Puni&s;hments? Thus does
<PB N="10" REF="001336_0011_0FB28879D9162A38">
<HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> act in oppo&s;ition to the Being, Word and Providence of God: And is not &s;uch a vile Principle to be abhorred?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is the <HI>Root</HI> of all <HI>Actual Sins.</HI> All the Sins of our <HI>Lives</HI> proceed from the Sin of our <HI>Nature.</HI> The <HI>Corruption of the Heart,</HI> is the ri&s;e and &s;pring of all Sinful Thoughts, Words and Deeds, Mat. 15.18, 19. <HI>Out of the Heart,</HI> as corrupt, <HI>proceed Evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries,</HI> &amp;c. 'Tis <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> within that <HI>conceives and brings forth Sin,</HI> Jam. 1.14, 15. For this cau&s;e all Sinful Deeds are called the <HI>Deeds of the Fle&s;h,</HI> Gal. 5.19, 20, 21. Neither God, nor the Devil, nor the World, are the Authors of our Sins; but our own <HI>Corrupt Hearts:</HI> the&s;e are the next and immediate cau&s;es of every iniquity committed by us. This <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is then the radical Sin, the <HI>Root of Bitterne&s;s</HI> upon which all Sin grows; Tis the <HI>Sin of Sins,</HI> the Mother and Nur&s;e of all Sins, &s;eminally containing in it every &s;ort and kind of Sins; it is therefore more evil than all <HI>Actual Sins;</HI> for there is more of Evil in the <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> than in the <HI>Effect;</HI> more Poi&s;on in the <HI>Fountain,</HI> than in all its <HI>Streams;</HI> It is but <HI>Some degree</HI> of the Venome and Malignity of <HI>Original Sin</HI> that is diffu&s;ed into all <HI>Actual Sins.</HI> Surely, &s;uch a principle as this, which is productive of all manner of Evils, is to be greatly lamented.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="11" REF="001336_0012_0FB2887B41B1CAC8">4. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> is <HI>more &s;et upon Sin becau&s;e God forbids it.</HI> Such is the mad fury and rage of Lu&s;t, as it makes the Command and Pro|hibition of God, the very <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> why it urges to Evil, and di&s;&s;wades from Good. The more God forbids a thing the more eager it is after it, and therefore will do it <HI>becau&s;e God forbids it.</HI> The more God requires a thing the more back|ward tis to it, and <HI>Therefore</HI> will not do it <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> God requires it: It <HI>takes occa&s;ion from the Com|mandment to work all manner of Iniquity,</HI> and there|by di&s;covers it &s;elf to be <HI>Out of mea&s;ure Sinful,</HI> Rom. 7.11, 13. Were not a thing <HI>Forbidden</HI> it could be content to let it alone, and were not a thing <HI>Commanded</HI> it could be content to do it. <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> is <HI>Irritated</HI> and exa&s;perated by the Law of God: It delights to cro&s;s God in His Will; Its Working thus in a &s;piteful oppo&s;ition to the Command of God, is daily to be &s;een in the <HI>Lives</HI> of men. When God would have had the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> go into <HI>Canaan,</HI> then they were for returning into <HI>Egypt;</HI> and when God would <HI>not</HI> have them go into <HI>Canaan,</HI> then they were &s;et upon going in, <HI>Numb.</HI> 14.4, 40. <HI>&amp;c.

Should it not make our Souls bleed to find that there is &s;uch an heart in us; &s;o full of malignity again&s;t the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Supreme Lord?</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="12" REF="001336_0013_0FB2887CB854B338">5. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> does <HI>alwayes Sollicite to Sin,</HI> It is a principle that is <HI>ever</HI> &s;tirring and work|ing toward Sin: it is <HI>Never Idle,</HI> but <HI>Always Active,</HI> and its <HI>Perpetual Tendency</HI> is to Sin. Some|times it prompts to <HI>Sins of Omi&s;&s;ion,</HI> endeavour|ing to draw us off from that duty which God requires of us; and if it cannot prevail to a neglect of duty, it labours to make us <HI>Carele&s;s,</HI> Slighty and Formal in the di&s;charge of it: and if it cannot work us up to this frame, it en|deavours to <HI>Ob&s;truct</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tract</HI> us in the duty as much as it can, Rom. 7.21. <HI>I find then a Law, that when I would do good, evil is pre&s;ent with me.</HI> He experimentally found the &s;tirrings of Cor|ruption in the very time of his di&s;charging Duties, that he could not do them as well as he would.

the <HI>Scorce</HI> of all our Calamities. Were it not for our Lu&s;ts, we might be ea&s;y in all Con|ditions. Well may a Believer cry out and com|plain of &s;uch an hurtful principle.</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>As a Godly Man greatly bewailes, &s;o he much longs to be delivered from Indwelling Sin.</HI> He is &s;o wearied with it, as that his very Soul de&s;ires to be <HI>delivered</HI> from it. Now there are three things re&s;pecting <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> which he longs to be delivered from.</P>
<P N="1">1. He de&s;ires to be <HI>Delivered</HI> from the <HI>Pre|vailing Power</HI> of <HI>Indwelling Sin.</HI> It is mo&s;t cer|tain that a true Believer is <HI>Delivered</HI> from the <HI>Reigning Power</HI> of Indwelling Sin: It does not <HI>Lord</HI> it over him, &s;o that he &s;hould willingly, readily and chearfully obey it, as he did in his State of Unregeneracy. A Convert cea&s;es to be a <HI>Servant of Sin,</HI> and is freed from its ab&s;olute rule, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.17, 18. And Sin Within &s;hall never more have a plenary <HI>Dominion</HI> over them, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 14. Neverthele&s;s Sin within is capable of <HI>Prevailing</HI> over Believers, and oftentimes does actually <HI>Prevail:</HI> It carryes them away to great and Scandalous Sins, as the Scriptures do te&s;tify in many in&s;tances. Now the truely Godly do earne&s;tly de&s;ire that they may be Saved from Sins prevalency. And hence they are much in <HI>Prayer</HI> to God for pre&s;ervation from the <HI>Power</HI> of Lu&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19.13. <HI>and</HI> 119.133. And hence
<PB N="15" REF="001336_0016_0FB288867AF69EA8">
it is that they exerci&s;e them&s;elves in endeavours to <HI>Keep under the Body of Sin,</HI> 1 Cor. 9.27. A Godly Man is one that has heartily renounced Subjection to the <HI>Law of Sin,</HI> and de&s;ires that it may never more over-power him.</P>
<P N="2">2. He de&s;ires to be <HI>Delivered</HI> from the <HI>Terrify|ing Power</HI> of <HI>Indwelling</HI> Sin. This Sin is many times a principle of <HI>Terrour</HI> to the truly Godly: It &s;o darkens their Minds, &s;o deadens their Hearts and Affections, &s;o &s;tirs and works in them, as that it fills them with perplexing doubts and fears. It many times lays them unto di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions about them&s;elves: they are made to <HI>Fear</HI> whether God be their reconciled Father and Friend, whether they have any intere&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and His <HI>Grace,</HI> whether they have any title to or well-grounded Hopes of Heaven. They are ready to account them&s;elves <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> and to De&s;pair of Salvation thro' the horrid workings of Inherent Corruption. Now that which <HI>Delivers</HI> them from the&s;e <HI>Terrours,</HI> is the &s;ence and a&s;&s;urance of Gods Love; and there|fore they do earne&s;tly de&s;ire that the Lord would lift up the light of his Countenance up|on them, <HI>Give to them the Joy of his Salvation,</HI> and <HI>make them to hear the Voice of Gladne&s;s,</HI> P&s;al. 51.8, 12. They cry to God for tho&s;e fre&s;h gales of the Spirit, which may &s;catter tho&s;e <HI>Fogs</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;ts,</HI> which <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI> has covered their Souls withal.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="16" REF="001336_0017_0FB28888C5FD18A8">3.

The <HI>Body of Death</HI> is &s;uch an Annoyance to an holy man, as that he would fain be perfectly and eternally rid of it.</P>
<P>Now 'tis only in <HI>Glorification</HI> that a Believer comes to be fully &s;et at liberty from this trouble|&s;ome inmate: In this Life it will be and abide in us, but when we leave this World and go to <HI>Glory,</HI> then we &s;hall be altogether <HI>Sinle&s;s;</HI> Sin &s;hall no more have a Being in us; for this cau&s;e a Godly man de&s;ires and pants after <HI>Hea|ven,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.2, 4.

One great thing which makes <HI>Heaven</HI> de&s;ireable to a Saint, is, That <HI>Perfect Innocency of Nature</HI> which he &s;hall there be re&s;tored to: <HI>Heaven</HI> is not &s;o much de&s;ired by an holy Man, becau&s;e he &s;hall there be freed from <HI>All Sufferings,</HI> as becau&s;e he &s;hall be freed from <HI>All Sin.</HI></P>

Sin will &s;trive to regain its <HI>Ancient Dominion</HI> over you, and to reduce you to former Subjection, but this &s;hall never be effected. Ail its Attempts this way &s;hall prove Un&s;ucce&s;sful. You may &s;ome|times in an <HI>Hour</HI> of <HI>Temptation</HI> fear, that <HI>Corruption</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="001336_0027_0FB288A63720EE28">
will recover its ma&s;tery over you; but be not afraid: Keep up a <HI>Fear of Watchfulne&s;s,</HI> but don't give way to a <HI>Fear of Di&s;pondency:</HI> The Almighty and mo&s;t Faithful God has given His Word for it, That <HI>Sin &s;hall not have Dominion over you,</HI> Rom. 6.14. Tho' it may pur&s;ue you, as <HI>Pharaoh</HI> did <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> yet it &s;hall never carry you back into Bon|dage. The Lord that has <HI>Begun to Deliver,</HI> will <HI>Go on to Deliver;</HI> He will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly keep you <HI>By His Mighty Power thro' Faith unto Salvation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Your <HI>Wearied Souls</HI> &s;hall &s;hortly be <HI>At Re&s;t</HI> from <HI>Indwelling</HI> Sin. It will not be long before your de&s;ires of <HI>Deliverance</HI> &s;hall be fully Satisfyed. That which you <HI>Long</HI> for &s;hall be granted unto you, and that very <HI>Quickly. Heaven,</HI> tho' it be <HI>Afar off</HI> as to local di&s;tance, yet 'tis <HI>Near</HI> in point of Time. A few days more and you go to that Place, where <HI>Nothing that Defileth Entereth in.</HI> Hold out a little longer in Striving again&s;t <HI>Sin,</HI> and you &s;hall never more have any <HI>Con|flict</HI> or <HI>Combate</HI> with it. Your <HI>Warfare</HI> &s;hall &s;peedily be <HI>Accompli&s;hed,</HI> and then &s;hall you ex|perimentally Know that which your fain <HI>would</HI> Know, but never yet <HI>Did</HI> Know, Namely, <HI>What it is to Serve GOD without Sin,</HI> and that to all ETERNITY.</P>
