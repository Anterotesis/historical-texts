<P>THE life of a Believer is in nothing more expre&s;t to the life, than in that of a Souldier. There is therefore advantage for a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, when called to &s;peak to that Order of men, to improve the <HI>Meta|phor,</HI> for the common benefit of all that pro|fe&s;s them&s;elves to be of the <HI>Church Militant</HI>: and herein to imitate <HI>Christ</HI> him&s;elf, who took all opportunities to <HI>Spiritualize</HI> every thing that he had Occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e of: and were it not for this, there would be &s;mall en|couragement to appear in this work at &s;uch a day, wherein the ancient <HI>Military Spirit</HI> is well nigh lo&s;t, as if there were no farther u&s;e for it: whereas, if it be thus al&s;o with <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans</HI> in regard of their <HI>Spiritual Warfare,</HI> there is need of taking all Opportunities to rou&s;e them up, le&s;t they rue it for ever.</P>
<P>The great encouragement of a <HI>Souldier,</HI> to be valiant, is the hope of <HI>Victory,</HI> and a <HI>Tri|umph</HI> following upon it: and herein is the true <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Priviledged' that he is not left at <HI>&V;ncertainty,</HI> to the <HI>Chance of War,</HI> wherein <HI>the Battel is not alwayes to the Strong,</HI> but the

<P>THE Emperour <HI>Valentinian,</HI> when He was Dying, had his Friends comforting of him with the Re|membrance of his pa&s;t <HI>Victories</HI>: He told them that he Gloryed in one Victory above all the re&s;t; <HI>Inimicorum nequi&s;|&s;imum vici</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>carnem meam: I have had a Victory over my Fle&s;h, the wor&s;t Enemy in the World.</HI> Now my <HI>Text</HI> pre&s;ents us with a Glorious <HI>Victory,</HI> and Eternal <HI>Triumph,</HI> not only over one, but over all Evils and Enemies; and gives the <HI>Dying</HI> Chri|&s;tian ground to &s;ay, with the Ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle, <HI>I have fought a good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the Faith: Hence forth there is Laid up for me a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord, the Righteous Judge &s;hall give me at that day</HI>; and he

may Triumphantly add, <HI>O Death where is thy Sting? O Grave where is thy Victory?</HI> Of all terri|ble <HI>Enemies,</HI> Death the <HI>King of Terrors</HI> is most ter|rible; and of all <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> the Grave, <HI>The Hou&s;e for all Living,</HI> is the mo&s;t dark and di&s;mal to the Eye of Nature; but yet the Truths of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> concerning both, are much more comfor|table: As appears by this glorious Triumph of Faith over both, ari&s;ing from the con&s;ideration of the Re&s;urrection of the Dead, and Change of the Living; which is expre&s;t in the 55, 56, 57. <HI>ver&s;es</HI> of this <HI>Chapter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oh Death where is thy Sting? Oh Grave where is thy Victory? the &s;ting of Death is &s;in, and the strength of &s;in is the Law; but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>: which the Apo&s;tle interpreteth thus. <HI>The &s;ting of Death</HI> [that is, that whereby Death is rendred terrible and de&s;tructive] is <HI>Sin,</HI> that is, the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t man <HI>Adam,</HI> in whom all dye; yet made more deadly by our Actual Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: but it is that which is the Condemning Sin.</P>
<P>And what is the <HI>&s;trength of Sin,</HI> whereby it pre|vails thus unto death? Why, it is <HI>the Law: In the Day that thou Eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt dye the Death; and the Soul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall dye.</HI> Thus, <HI>By one man Sin Entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned,</HI> Rom. 5.12. Now God's Truth and Ju&s;tice is ingaged to puni&s;h Sin with Death; and here is the &s;trength of &s;in to puni&s;h the Sinner; that
<PB N="7" REF="000774_0004_0FAA5383C3061BE0">
is, the demerit of Sin is appointed by the Law.</P>
<P>But whence then is this Triumph? <HI>God hath given us the Victory</HI>] God that appointed the Law for mans rule, and Death for the puni&s;h|ment of mans Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion [<HI>hath given us the Victory</HI>] by taking away Sin, and &s;o our obligati|on to &s;uffer the puni&s;hment; and &s;o changing the very Nature of Death, that now it cea&s;eth to be deadly, and becomes &s;alutiterous.</P>
<P>But how did the Lord effect this? It was, [<HI>through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord</HI>] that is, by the Death, and Obedience unto Death of that one man Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord: In which there was <HI>Satisfaction</HI> to the Law, <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> to the Sinner, <HI>Merit</HI> of Life and Glory. Chri&s;t by his Re&s;ur|rection and A&s;cen&s;ion took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all for us, and makes way for the Effectual Application of all to us.</P>
<P>The Summe is,</P>
<P>That whereas Death and the Grave are mo&s;t terrible Enemies, by rea&s;on of the demerit of &s;in, binding over the Sinner to an&s;wer the Law in &s;uffering the puni&s;hment by Law due to Sin; yet God of his Grace having given <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> for our <HI>Surety,</HI> and &s;o for our <HI>Saviour</HI> from Sin and Death, hath by taking away <HI>Sin,</HI> and rendring <HI>Death</HI> unable to do us any hurt, given us cau&s;e, whil&s;t we look at Death as terrible through Sin, to Triumph over it, as Captivated to our Service, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord: And as Chri&s;t hath gi|ven us an <HI>Eternal Triumph</HI> over Death the La&s;t

Enemy; &s;o hath therein given us a <HI>Happy Victory,</HI> and Holy Triumph over all Evils and Enemies; Temporal, Spiritual, Eternal.</P>
<P>Hence Ob&s;erve:</P>
<P>DOCTRINE.</P>
<P>That the true Chri&s;tian Souldier &s;hall at la&s;t obtain a compleat Victory, and Eternal Triumph over all Evils and Enemies, is matter of Thanksgiving un|to God through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;tiani</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Cyprian) mori po&s;&s;unt, vinci non po&s;&s;unt.</HI> Chri&s;tians may Dye, but cannot be O|vercome.

<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That the true Chri&s;tian Souldier &s;hall at la&s;t obtain a compleat victory and an Eternal Triumph over all Evils and Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>For the clearing up of this Propo&s;ition, take a few Conclu&s;ions as Praeliminary.</P>
<P>Conclu&s;ion I. <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us is the Captain General of Salvation.</HI> Heb. 2.10. <HI>For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things; in bringing many Sons unto Glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through Sufferings.</HI> The Author of the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> doth here evidently compare Chri&s;t to <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> the Captain and Leader of the People into <HI>Canaan</HI>; and all true Chri&s;tians are put under his Conduct and Guidance to bring them &s;afe to Glory.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t is called their <HI>[ARCHEGOS] Prince, Ruler and Captain of their Salvation,</HI> in re&s;pect of his Authority and Right to Rule over them, in order unto their Salvation. Hence He appeared unto <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> as the <HI>Captain of the Lords Ho&s;t,</HI> Jo&s;h. 5.14. Chri&s;t is the <HI>Captain of Salvation</HI> in re&s;pect of this actual Leading and Conduct of them, by his <HI>Example, Spirit and Grace,</HI> through all the Dif|ficulties of their way, and warfare: he is there|fore called, a <HI>Leader and Commander to the People,</HI> I&s;a. 55.4. <HI>Behold I have given him for a witne&s;s to
<PB REF="000774_0006_0FAA53852D2144B8">
the people, a Leader and Commander to the People&middot;</HI> So He is their [<HI>PRODROMOS</HI>] their <HI>Fore-runners</HI> Heb. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter"> 20. <HI>Whether the Fore-runner is for us Entred, even Je&s;us, made an High Prie&s;t for ever after the Order of Melchizedek.</HI> Or as <HI>Daniel</HI> calls Him, the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> the <HI>Prince</HI> or <HI>Guide.</HI> Dan. 9.25. <HI>know therefore and under&s;tand, that from the going forth of the Commandment to re&s;tore and build Jeru&s;alem, un|to the Me&s;&s;iah the Prince &s;hall be &s;even weeks,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Yea, Chri&s;t is the <HI>Captain of Salvation,</HI> as he is to them the <HI>Author</HI> or <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of <HI>Eternal Salvation</HI>; he procured &amp; purcha&s;ed it for them, &amp; gives them &s;afe conduct unto the full Enjoyment of it. The way in which God will bring the Chri&s;tian Soul|dier to Glory, is full of Intricacy, Difficulty, Per|plexity and Oppo&s;ition; &s;o that he hath need of a <HI>Captain,</HI> Leader &amp; Guide, to carry him through it; but yet all is rendred &s;afe and &s;ecure to him, through the power, grace and faithfulne&s;s of his Leader.</P>
<P>Conclu&s;ion 2. <HI>This Captain hath his Souldiers and Followers.</HI> Every true Christian is a Souldier un|der the Command and Conduct of Chri&s;t as his General. 2 Tim. 2.3. <HI>Thou therefore endure hard|ne&s;s as a good Souldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Every Chri|&s;tian when he is new Born, is Born a Souldier. It is &s;aid of <HI>Goliah.</HI> that <HI>He was a man of War from his Youth</HI>; 1 Sam. 17.23. but it may be tru|ly &s;aid of the true Chri&s;tian, that he is a man of War from his <HI>Birth</HI>; he hath at his fir&s;t Conver|&s;ion
<PB N="11" REF="000774_0006_0FAA53852D2144B8">
given him&s;elf up unto Chri&s;t, as the Captain of his Salvation, Li&s;ted him&s;elf under Chri&s;t's Banner, and hath ingaged to Fight under his Command and Conduct: He is on Chri&s;t's &s;ide, Chri&s;t's Enemies are his Enemies, and Chri&s;t's Friends and Followers, are his Brethren, Compa|nions and Fellow-Souldiers: as <HI>Paul</HI> calls <HI>Archippus</HI> his Fellow-Souldier; not only as a Mini&s;ter, but as a Chri&s;tian. <HI>Philemon ver&s;e</HI> 2. <HI>Aphia and Archip|pus our Fellow Souldiers.</HI></P>
<P>And as Chri&s;tians are Souldiers, &s;o <HI>Congregatio|nal Churches,</HI> are particular Companies, to which Chri&s;tians (that walk orderly, and have oppor|tunity) do joyn in Fellow&s;hip; and the Vi&s;ible <HI>Catholick Church,</HI> is as an Army with Banners. <HI>Cant.</HI> 6.4. <HI>Thou art beautiful, O my Love, as Tirzah comely as Jeru&s;alem, terrible as an Army with Ban|ners</HI>: This Army hath the Captain of the Lords Ho&s;t for their General.</P>
<P>Conclu&s;ion 3. <HI>The&s;e Souldiers are compleat in Arms. Truth</HI> is their <HI>Girdle, Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> their <HI>Brea&s;t-plate, Preparation of the Go&s;pel,</HI> their <HI>Shoes; Faith</HI> their <HI>Shield, Hope</HI> their <HI>Helmet,</HI> the <HI>Word of God</HI> their <HI>Sword:</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> if not a distinct piece of Armour, yet very nece&s;&s;ary to the fa&s;t|ning on, and improvement of tho&s;e Weapons of their Spiritual Warfare: Hereby they ingage the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the God of Arm<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="3 letters"> to be with them: Hence it is annexed to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="3 letters">i&s;tians Pa|noply, Eph. 6. <HI>from</HI> 11. to the 18th <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="000774_0007_0FAA5385F63CCBD0">Conclu&s;ion 4. <HI>This Captain General Leads his Souldiers into the Field, and teacheth them their Mili|tary Skill.</HI> This World is the Field of War, and this Captain orders the time when, the place where, and means by which, the true Chri&s;tian in Saving Conver&s;ion, and Religious Profe&s;&s;ion, &s;hall enter into the Field, and the time how long he &s;hall continue in the Field, and the &s;everal Engagements he &s;hall be called to, and the varie|ty of Entertainment he &s;hall meet with here, and his Pa&s;&s;age out of it: It is true in a Meta|phorical, as well as in a Literal Sen&s;e, <HI>That our Times are in Gods Hands,</HI> P&s;al. 31.15. <HI>He al&s;o teacheth their hands to War, and their fingers to fight,</HI> P&s;al. 144.1. He be&s;tows upon them all their Warlike Accompli&s;hments; he gives them Skill and Will to Improve all their Spiritual Weapons <HI>Offen&s;ive</HI> and <HI>Defen&s;ive.</HI></P>
<P>Conclu&s;ion 5. <HI>This Captain of the Lords Ho&s;t gives a Banner to his Souldiers and Followers, to be Di&s;played for their Safety in the wor&s;t times,</HI> P&s;al. 60.4, 5. <HI>Thou ha&s;t given a Banner to them that fear thee, that it may be di&s;played becau&s;e of the Truth.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. A <HI>Banner</HI> was of old (as now it is) a <HI>War|like En&s;ign</HI> &s;et up or di&s;played for the Souldiers, under the Conduct of &s;uch a Chieftain for Mili|tary Ends; the civil u&s;e of it was commended &amp; commanded to <HI>I&s;rael, Numb. &s;econd Chapter and every

man must pitch by his own Standard, and by the En&s;ign of his Fathers Hou&s;e.</HI> It &s;ignifies the Throne of God among&s;t them; which was not among&s;t any of the re&s;t of the Nations: Therefore this was the Warlike <HI>Motto</HI> of the Jews, <HI>Who is like to thee a|mong&s;t the Gods O Lord</HI>? Under this as a Di&s;played Banner <HI>David</HI> Marched again&s;t the <HI>Phili&s;tine</HI> Champion, 1 Sam. 17.45. <HI>I come again&s;t thee in the Name of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the God of I&s;raels Armies</HI> It had a &s;pecial &s;ignification of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> that was to be Lift up as a Banner. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 10.12. <HI>In that day there &s;hall be a Root of Je&s;&s;e, which &s;hall stand for an En&s;ign of the People, to it &s;hall the Gen|tiles &s;eek, and his Re&s;t &s;hall be Glorious.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Banner</HI> &s;ignifies the Love of God, and Chri&s;t to his People, Cant. 2.4. <HI>His Banner over me was Love</HI>: This Love is manife&s;ted in their Pre&s;ervation and Salvation from all their Enemies. Hence it is &s;aid, I&s;a. 62.10, 11. <HI>Lift up a Standard for the People, &s;ay, behold thy Salvation cometh.</HI></P>
<P>A Banner is put for all the manife&s;t tokens of Gods Favour to, and gracious Pre&s;ence with his People, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 31.9. <HI>The Princes &s;hall be afraid of the En|&s;ign, &s;aith the Lord</HI>: that is, they &s;hall &s;ee the Love and Faithfulne&s;s of God to his People and be afraid.</P>
<P N="2">II. This <HI>Banner</HI> is of great u&s;e to the Souldiers. The Standard, the Banner doth di&s;tingui&s;h one Army from another: &s;o doth the pre&s;ence of God in Chri&s;t manife&s;ted by the &s;igns thereof, di&s;tin|gui&s;h

<P>The <HI>Banner</HI> is for direction to the whole band, and the Standard to the whole Army: &s;o is Gods pre&s;ence and conduct to His People; both in the <HI>March</HI>: Souldiers mu&s;t follow their Colours, and in their <HI>Re&s;t,</HI> when the Standard is pitch'd thats the place of Re&s;t, <HI>Numb.</HI> 10.9.17, 18, 23&punc; Yea when <HI>Scattered abroad</HI> by the violence of any temptation, the <HI>Colours</HI> &s;hew whether the Souldier mu&s;t repair: To Chri&s;t held forth &s;hall the <HI>gathering of the People be, Gen.</HI> 49.10.

<P>The <HI>Banner</HI> is for <HI>Encouragement</HI> to the Souldier and his deeper Engagement to fight; he mu&s;t not leave his <HI>Colours</HI> in the greate&s;t hazard, but rather chu&s;e to dy: &s;o the Chri&s;tian Souldier, mu&s;t never for&s;ake his God, Chri&s;t, his Hou&s;e, his Ordinances &amp;c. <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 5.13, 14, 15. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.29.</P>
<P>The <HI>Banner</HI> was for defence and &s;helter and deliverance; it was the &s;afe&s;t place in all the <HI>Camp</HI>: &s;o is the Spiritual <HI>Banner.</HI> Hence &s;aith the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, he &s;hall in the time of trouble hide me in his pavilion, in the &s;ecret of his tabernacle.</HI> Thus the <HI>Pillar of Cloud,</HI> was a defence to I&s;rael.</P>

<P N="3">III. The <HI>Di&s;playing of the Banner</HI> is the whole Military Improvement of it for the advantage of the Souldier, and the detriment of the Enemy. Therefore it is the flouri&s;hing of the Colours (as we call it) before the whole Army, and in &s;ight of the Enemy.

Souldier a compleat Victory over Death the la&s;t Ene|my,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.26. <HI>The La&s;t Enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed is Death</HI>: Here con&s;ider two or three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Death</HI> is an <HI>Enemy,</HI> a formidable Enemy, <HI>Job</HI> 18.14. <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.15. Now <HI>Death</HI> will appear to be an <HI>Enemy.</HI> if we con&s;ider that it deals with men as an Enemy, 1. In matters <HI>Outward,</HI> Tem|poral, and of this Life; here Death is the great <HI>Bereaver,</HI> and the great <HI>Tormentor.</HI> Death robbs our Bodies of all perfection; Death forceth a man from his Wealth, and whole outward E&s;tate with|out hope of recovery, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 5.15. <HI>As he came forth of his Mothers Womb, naked &s;hall he return, to go as he came, and &s;hall take nothing of his Labour, which he may carry away in his hand, Job</HI> 1.21. Death &s;poils a man of his Name, Honours, and power in the World, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 31.12. <HI>I am forgotten as a Dead man out of mind, I am like a broken ve&s;&s;el, Eccl.</HI> 3.18, 19, 20. Death &s;eparates deare&s;t Friends, and neare&s;t Relation. 2. Death deals with men as an Enemy, in matters <HI>Internal</HI> and Spiritual: Death deprives of all Spiritual good enjoyed in this Life: It cuts down the Tree that it &s;tands no longer in the <HI>Vineyard</HI>; there is no Soul-&s;aving Work to be done in the Grave whether we are all going, no opportunity to pray, hear, read be|lieve or repent when once arrived at that Hou&s;e prepared for all Living: Death bereaves of the time, day, and &s;ea&s;on of Grace: when Death comes, God &s;wears, <HI>Time &s;hall be no more,</HI> his <HI>Spi|rit
<PB N="29" REF="000774_0015_0FAA538D6D021070">
&s;hall no longer &s;trive</HI>; Death bereaves us of all opportunity to lay up for Eternity. 3. Death deals with men that dye in their Sins as an Ene|my in matters Eternal and Everla&s;ting. It be|reaves of Eternal Good: all that dye under the power of Death, it proves an Eternal Bereave|ment to them; they lo&s;e God, Chri&s;t, the Spi|rit, Mercy, Grace, Glory, Heaven and Happine&s;s. As Death is a great Bereaver, &s;o he is a great <HI>Tormentor</HI>; all pain, &s;orrow, angui&s;h and trouble, is but the working of Death in this Life; yea, it makes way for Eternal Mi&s;ery in the Life to come.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Death</HI> is a <HI>cruel</HI> Enemy; Death is an Ene|my that will &s;hew no pitty, <HI>Cant.</HI> 8.6. it is cruel as appears by the Racks, Torments, Strapadoes, and Wounds that it inflicts; it is cruel in that it &s;pares none for his Age, Rank or Quality, but is pittile&s;s to all &s;orts of per&s;ons; it neither regards the per&s;on of the old, nor &s;hews favour to the young; it regards no Cries, Prayers, Tears, ad|mits no ran&s;ome, is not moved with any moans, &s;ighs or groans, is deaf to all Entreaties. <HI>Death</HI> is an Enemy that <HI>cannot be avoided</HI>; you may fear Death, but cannot e&s;cape it, you may fly from it, but cannot get out of its reach; there is no &s;afety from the Enemy, but in the bo&s;ome of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Death</HI> is a <HI>Vanqui&s;hed</HI> Enemy; 'tis under the Keys of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.18. Chri&s;t has overcome Death, and aboli&s;hed it, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.10. Chri&s;t hath done this by his Death, <HI>meritoriou&s;ly,</HI> by
