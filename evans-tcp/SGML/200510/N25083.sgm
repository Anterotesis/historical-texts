<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT II.</HEAD>
<P>Add a quantity of water, equal to eight or ten times the bulk of the sulphuric acid, to the sulphuric acid and zinc, and a vio|lent commotion will begin, attended with a high degree of heat, and a discharge of hydrogenous gas.</P>

<HEAD>EXPERIMENT III.</HEAD>
<P>Apply a lighted taper to the mouth of the vial, and an explosion will happen, or the air will burn with a lambent flame at the mouth of the vessel.</P>
<P>This experiment may be performed up|wards of twenty times with the same ma|terials.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT IV.</HEAD>
<P>Hold the mouth of the inflammable air pistol over the vial for about half a minute, shutting up the touch hole with the thumb, and the hydrogenous gas will rise into it; put in the stopper and apply a lighted ta|per to the touch hole, and an explosion will take place.</P>
<P>In these experiments the water is decom|posed. Its oxigene calcines the zinc, while its hydrogene is disengaged; the acid acts upon the calcined metal, without being al|tered, forming white vitriol, or sulphate of zinc.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="033245_0009_0FF6A003EE54CF30">
Hydrogenous gas is fatal to animal life, extinguishes flame, will not burn without the contact of pure air, and explodes when mixed with atmospheric air, with a loud noise.</P>

<HEAD>EXPERIMENT V.</HEAD>
<P>Put two tea spoons-full of red lead into a vial, and pour upon it a small quantity of the sulphuric acid, and a high degree of heat will be produced; connect the end of a glass syphon on which a cork is fixed, to the mouth of the vial, and dip the other ex|tremity in a large bowl, or small bucket nearly filled with water, and bubbles of air will pass through the fluid. Fill a small wide mouthed bottle with water, and hold it over the bubbles, and they will rise into it and displace the water. When the bubbles cease to come over, apply a lighted taper to the bottom of the vessel containing the red lead and sulphuric acid, and the dis|charge will begin again.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT IX.</HEAD>
<P>Immerse a lighted taper in the azotic gas, and it will be extinguished.</P>
<P>Azotic air is improper for respiration or combustion; is lighter than atmospheric air; plants live and vegetate in it; and it mixes with the other gases, without combining with them.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="substance">
<HEAD>Of Alkalis.</HEAD>
<P>Alkalis have an urinous burning taste; turn most blue vegetable substances of a green colour; effervesce with certain acids, and compose neutral salts with all; form glass when melted with quartzose substan|ces, and render oils miscible with water.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="033245_0012_0FF6A011A2DFF2B0">
There are three alkalis.</P>
<P>Pot-ash, or the vegetable fixed alkali, called also the salt of tartar and of worm|wood; soda, mineral or fossil alkali; and ammoniac or the volatile alkali, alkaline gas, or spirit of hartshorne.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="substance">
<HEAD>Of Pot-ash.</HEAD>
<P>Pot-ash is generally obtained by making a lye of the ashes of vegetables, evaporating the water, and calcining the combustible matter, which remains mixed with the ashes, in a high degree of heat.</P>
<P>It may likewise be obtained very pure, by fusing the nitrate of pot-ash or salt petre with charcoal, dissolving the substance which remains behind in water, and filter|ing it through paper. When pure pot-ash is exposed to the air, it attracts a large por|tion of moisture, and is resolved into a li|quor called the oil of tartar per deliquium.</P>
<P>The common pot-ash of the shops con|tains a large portion of carbonic acid, or
<PB N="15" REF="033245_0013_0FF6A013C72193A8">
fixed air, which causes it to effervesce upon the addition of an acid.</P>
<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT X.</HEAD>
<P>Put some of the solution of the carbonate of pot-ash into a wine glass, and add a few drops of the sulphuric, nitric or muriatic acid to it, and a commotion will take place, called an effervescence, which is owing to a discharge of the carbonic acid, or fixed air.</P>
<P>If the sulphuric acid is used, a sulphate of pot-ash or vitriolated tartar will be form|ed; if the nitric acid, nitrate of pot-ash, or common nitre; and if the muriatic, a mu|riate of pot-ash or digestive salt of Syl|vius.</P>
<P>Pot-ash is rendered caustic by adding a small quantity of quick-lime to a solution of it in water. The carbonic acid of the carbonate of pot-ash, unites to the quick|lime, and forms a carbonate of lime.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT XI.</HEAD>
<P>Put some of the solution of caustic pot|ash into a wine-glass, and add a few drops
<PB N="16" REF="033245_0014_0FF6A0184CE88508">
of any of the acids in the Chest to it, and no effervescence will take place.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="substance">
<HEAD>Of Soda, Mineral, or Fossil Alkali.</HEAD>
<P>Soda is generally obtained from the ashes of marine plants, by proceeding in the same manner as in procuring pot-ash.</P>
<P>It may also be made from the muriate of soda or common salt, by adding pot-ash to a solution of this substance, and evapo|rating a part of the liquor by means of heat, when the pure alkali will be obtained in crystals.</P>
<P>The pot-ash unites to the muriatic acid of the common salt, and forms muriate of pot-ash, which will be held in solution in the su|pernatant liquor, while the soda will be set at liberty.</P>
<P>Soda differs from pot-ash; because it is less caustic; does not attract moisture from the atmosphere, but effloresces in it; crys|tallizes in rhomboidal octahedrons; forms different products with the same bases and is more proper for vitrification.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="substance">
<PB N="17" REF="033245_0015_0FF6A01E89EFCED8">
<HEAD>Of Ammoniac, the Volatile Alkali, or Alka|line Gas.</HEAD>
<P>Ammoniac is generally obtained from the distillation of animal substances.</P>
<P>It may be procured in a very pure state, by distilling equal parts of sifted quick lime and the muriate of ammoniac or common sal ammoniac together, in a glass retort, to which a receiver must be connected, hold|ing a portion of water, correspondent to the weight of the salt employed.</P>
<DIV3 N="12" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT XII.</HEAD>
<P>Put a small quantity of sal ammoniac in powder into a wine glass, and it will have no smell.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="13" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT XIII.</HEAD>
<P>Add a few drops of the solution of pot-ash, or a few grains of lime or pot-ash mois|tened with water, to the sal ammoniac, and a smell of alkaline gas will be produced.</P>
<P>The pot-ash or lime unites to the muria|tic acid of the sal ammoniac and forms a
<PB N="18" REF="033245_0016_0FF6A02131BAE948">
muriate of pot-ash or lime, while the am|moniac or volatile alkali is set at liberty.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="14" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT XIV.</HEAD>
<P>Hold the glass stopper of the bottle, con|taining the nitric or muriatic acid, over the sal ammoniac in the wine glass, and a cloud of white smoke will be produced.</P>
<P>The nitric or muriatic acid combines with the ammoniac or alkaline gas, and produces a nitrate or muriate of ammoniac.</P>
<P>Ammoniac is lighter than atmospheric air; has a strong pungent smell; corrodes the skin, and is fatal to animal life.</P>
<P>The common method of determining the presence of the alkalis, is by the effect they have of changing the generality of blue vege|table substances to a green color.</P>
<P>Indigo and litmus are exceptions to this law.</P>
<P>An alkaline salt may also be detected, by paper stained yellow by the tincture of tur|meric or rhubarb, which it changes to a
<PB N="19" REF="033245_0017_0FF66B41C8ED7238">
