<HEAD>AN ESSAY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A LATE elaborate Author tells us,
<Q>The De&s;ign of Colonies is to trade on more advantageous Conditions, than could otherwi&s;e be done with the neighbouring People, with whom all Advantages are reciprocal. It has been e&s;tabli&s;hed, that the State which has founded the Colonies, alone &s;hall trade in the Colonies; and that from very good Rea&s;ons; becau&s;e the De&s;ign of the Settlement was the Exten&s;ion of Commerce, not the Foundation of a City, or a new Empire. Thus it is &s;till a funda|mental Law of <HI>Europe,</HI> That all Commerce with a foreign Colony, &s;hall be regarded as a mere Mono|poly, puni&s;hable by the Laws of the Country. It is likewi&s;e acknowledged, that a Commerce e&s;tabli&s;hed between the Mother-Countries, does not include a Permi&s;&s;ion to trade in the Colonies; for tho&s;e always continue in a State of Prohibition.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Di&s;advantage of a Colony that lo&s;es the Li|berty of Commerce, is vi&s;ibly compen&s;ated by the Protection of the Mother-Country, who defends it by her Arms, or &s;upports it by her Laws. From hence follows a third Law of <HI>Europe,</HI> That when a foreign Commerce with a Colony is prohibited, it is
<PB N="4" REF="040619_0003_1016714608914878">
not lawful to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Seas; except in &s;uch Ca&s;es as are excepted by Treaty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The great Di&s;tance of our Colonies, is not an In|convenience that affects their Safety; for if their Mother-Country, on which they depend for their Defence, is far di&s;tant, no le&s;s di&s;tant are tho&s;e Na|tions, by whom they may be afraid of being conquer|ed. Be&s;ides, this Di&s;tance is the Cau&s;e, that tho&s;e who are e&s;tabli&s;hed, cannot conform to the Manner of living, in a Climate &s;o different from their own; they are obliged, therefore, to draw from the Mother-Country, all the Conveniencies of Life.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Carthagenians,</HI> to render the <HI>Sardinians</HI> and <HI>Car&s;icans</HI> more dependent, forbid their planting, &s;ow|ing, or doing any Thing of the like Kind, under Pain of Death.</Q>
So far my Author.</P>
<P>We are told, this Continent was fir&s;t di&s;covered to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> by <HI>Seba&s;tian Cabot,</HI> a <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> Adven|turer, who lived at <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> In the Year 1497 he was &s;ent by King HENRY the Seventh, to make Di&s;cove|ries in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies; Columbus</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;es, five Years before, having &s;et all the trading Nations in the World, upon Expeditions into <HI>America,</HI> in Hopes of &s;haring the Trea&s;ure of the new di&s;covered World, with the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The 25th of <HI>March,</HI> 1584, Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> ob|tained Letters Patent from Queen ELIZABETH, to po&s;|&s;e&s;s, plant, and enjoy, for him&s;elf and &s;uch Per&s;ons as he &s;hould nominate, them&s;elves and Succe&s;&s;ors, all &s;uch Lands, Territories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as they &s;hould di&s;cover not in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any Chri&s;tian Prince: And this Company was the fir&s;t of that Kind that was e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>A Settlement was carried on with much Zeal and Unanimity. The Form of Government con&s;i&s;ted of a Governor and twelve Councellors, incorporated by
<PB N="5" REF="040619_0004_10167147AF4E8CC8">
Name of <HI>The Governor and A&s;&s;i&s;tants of the City of</HI> Raleigh, <HI>in</HI> Virginia: But Sir <HI>Walter,</HI> that great Pro|jector and Furtherer of tho&s;e Di&s;coveries and Settle|ments, being under Trouble and Di&s;grace at Court, after an infinite Expence, be&s;ides the Hazard and Lo&s;s of many Lives, gave over all Thoughts of pro&s;ecuting tho&s;e De&s;igns. And the King, in 1606, did incorpo|rate two Companies in one Patent, to make two &s;epa|rate Colonies; the fir&s;t to Sir <HI>Thomas Gates, &amp;c.</HI> Adventurers of the City of <HI>London,</HI> with Liberty to begin their fir&s;t Plantation and Seat, at any Place upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Virginia,</HI> between the Degrees of 34 and 41; and for the &s;econd Colony, to <HI>Thomas Hanham, &amp;c.</HI> of the Town of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> with Liberty to begin their fir&s;t Plantation or Seat, at any Place upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Virginia,</HI> between the Degrees of 38 and 45. But (as the Author of <HI>The Hi&s;tory of</HI> Virginia, by a Native of the Place, ob&s;erves) they were no &s;ooner &s;et|tled in all this Happine&s;s and Security, but they fell into Jarrs and Di&s;&s;entions among them&s;elves; which continuing, the <HI>Virginia</HI> Adventurers, were under the Nece&s;&s;ity of petitioning his Maje&s;ty for a new Patent, with Leave to appoint a Governor. In Con&s;equence of which, they re-&s;ettled all their old Plantations that had been de&s;erted; made Additions to the Number of the Council; and called an A&s;&s;embly of Burge&s;&s;es from all Parts of the Country, which were to be elected by the People, in their &s;everal Plantations. The&s;e met the Governor and Council in <HI>May,</HI> 16<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">0, and &s;at in Con|&s;ultation in the &s;ame Hou&s;e with them: And this was the fir&s;t General A&s;&s;embly that ever was held there. This, however, had but little Effect; for the &s;ame Author tells us, That
<Q>the fatal Con&s;equences of the Company's Mal-admini&s;tration, cried &s;o loud, that King CHARLES the Fir&s;t coming to the Crown, had a tender Concern for the poor People that had been
<PB N="6" REF="040619_0005_10167149AA3B0CE8">
betrayed thither and lo&s;t; upon which Con&s;ideration he di&s;&s;olved the Company in 1626, reducing the Country and Government unto his own immediate Direction, appointing the Governor and Council him&s;elf, and ordering all Patents and Proce&s;s to i&s;&s;ue in his own Name, re&s;erving only to him&s;elf, an ea&s;y Quit-Rent of <HI>Two Shillings</HI> for every Hundred Acres of Land: He likewi&s;e confirmed the former Methods and Juri&s;dictions of the &s;everal Courts, as they had been appointed in the Year 1620; and was plea&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h the Con&s;titution to be by a Governor, Council, and A&s;&s;embly.</Q></P>
<P>This, however, was the fir&s;t regular Form in&s;tituted for the Government of the Colonies, and has been the Plan for every other of his Maje&s;ty's Colonies.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty and his Mini&s;ters having the Pro&s;perity of this Colony at Heart, and with great Rea&s;on, con|&s;idering the va&s;t Addition it brought into the Revenue; not le&s;s, it is computed, than <HI>Twenty Million,</HI> &s;ince its fir&s;t Settlement; all due Attention was given to the Legi&s;lature, and each kept &s;trictly within its own Sphere of Action: And Matters went &s;moothly on till the Year 1676, when <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Rebellion happened. Who|ever has read the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Tran&s;actions, will ea&s;ily &s;ee how far the A&s;&s;embly intere&s;ted them&s;elves in that Affair, which co&s;t the Crown and Colony upwards of &pound;. 200,000, and brought the Colony almo&s;t to an End. The Words of my Author are,
<Q>The King, when he was informed of this Rebellion, was &s;o far from hearkening to the Pretences of <HI>Bacon</HI>'s A&s;&s;em|bly, that he ordered a Squadron of Men of War to be fitted out, and a Regiment of Soldiers to embark on board it, for <HI>Virginia:</HI> But <HI>Bacon</HI> was dead be|fore Sir <HI>John Berry</HI> arrived with his Squadron; and his Followers returned every one to their own Homes, with Fear and Trembling. The Governor having
<PB N="7" REF="040619_0006_1016714C82B32D68">
made &s;ome fal&s;e Steps in the Affair, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, the Matter was not &s;o &s;trictly enquired into.</Q></P>
<P>Thus you have the Fate of this Colony; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> in the Di&s;&s;olution of the Company, for their Abu&s;e of the Powers they were entru&s;ted with; and <HI>next,</HI> by being almo&s;t brought to De&s;truction, by the Counte|nance the A&s;&s;embly gave <HI>Bacon.</HI> As to their Conduct &s;ince, it &s;hall be taken Notice of hereafter.</P>
<P>The Northern Colony, or <HI>Plymouth</HI> Adventurers, e&s;caped a Di&s;&s;olution, by their Friends at Court, but were not le&s;s guilty of the Abu&s;e of their Powers; as may appear from the following Letter; upon which I &s;hall make no further Comment, than to reque&s;t the &s;erious Peru&s;al of it, by tho&s;e our pretended Patriots; &mdash; let them con&s;ider in Time, what a perver&s;e, conti|nued, and ob&s;tinate Di&s;obedience to his Maje&s;ty's In|&s;tructions and Commands, may bring upon us. We have, I doubt, but few Friends at Court, and fewer, I doubt, at the Board of Trade: How, indeed, can we expect it, from our Behaviour, after &s;o many gentle Admonitions from both? But to the Letter, which is in very few People's Hands.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>HONOURABLE <HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>

But alas! Sir, the Commi&s;|&s;ion impowering tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners to hear and determine all Cau&s;es, whether military, civil, or cri|minal; (what they have further by In&s;truction, at pre&s;ent, we know not) &s;hould this take Place, what will become of our Civil Government? which hath been (under God) the Hedge to that Liberty for our Con&s;ciences, for which the fir&s;t Adventurers pa&s;&s;ed through, and bore up again&s;t all Difficulties that en|countered them, as in the Way to, &s;o in the Conti|nuance in, this Wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> We return unto you our true and hearty Thanks for your former Favours; and crave the Continuance thereof, as Opportunity &s;hall offer; and the great Mover of Hears, &s;hall incline you in ap|pearing our Friend &s;till, that, if po&s;&s;ible, the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners may be recalled; for which End we have made our humble Supplication to his Maje&s;ty; in who&s;e Eyes, if we find Favour, we and our Po&s;terity &s;hall have Cau&s;e to ble&s;s the Lord: But if the Decree be pa&s;&s;ed, &s;o that it may not be recalled, we &s;hall wait the Lord's I&s;&s;ue with us: And whatever may be the Conjectures of any, rendering Alterations here advi&s;eable, the I&s;&s;ue will &s;peak them to b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Subver&s;ion of all which makes this Place, or our A|bode herein, de&s;ireable; or if any of tho&s;e that de&s;ire

<P>How this Affair ended, I have not been able to learn from any Part of their Hi&s;tory. Mo&s;t People, how|ever, know what Amendments in their Con&s;titution, from Time to Time, have been made, and for what Rea&s;ons: The la&s;t was thought &s;evere; but the Al|ternate was given them, either to take it upon tho&s;e Conditions, or they were to have no Charter.</P>
<P>Numerous In&s;tances of the Encroachments and A|bu&s;e of Power in our Colony A&s;&s;emblies might be gi|ven, which I &s;hall wave; what the Event will be, is hard to determine: The many Complaints, however, that have gone, and daily going Home, upon this Su<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ect, have created Impre&s;&s;ions with his Maje&s;ty, his Mini&s;ters, and the Parliament, not at all in our Fa|vour. Our Neighbour Colony is, at pre&s;ent, in the Hands of the Potter; in what Shape they may turn off the Wheel we &s;hall &s;oon know. My Intention in this, upon the Whole, is no more, than to convince, if po&s;&s;ible, our A&s;&s;embly that they are in the Wrong, and do make a bad U&s;e of their Power; in which if they per&s;evere, it will infallibly bring our Con&s;titution and Privileges into Danger. This, at lea&s;t, is my Way of thinking. As this is a Subject of no &s;mall Importance to me and mine, as well as, I conceive, to us all, I hope a little Warmth (&s;hould it &s;o happen) will be pardoned.</P>
<P>Previous to this it may be nece&s;&s;ary, as few of our A&s;&s;embly-men have had the Advantage of a Liberal Education, or the Opportunity of Books to inform them&s;elves of the Nature of Government (<HI>e&s;pecially that of our own,</HI>) to pre&s;ent them with a &s;hort Sketch of it, which I accidentally met with; and is as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="040619_0010_1016715ABAE7ECF0">
<Q>The De&s;ign of Civil Government is to &s;ecure the Per&s;ons and Properties, and Peace of Mankind, from the Inva&s;ions and Injuries of their Neighbours: Whereas, if there were no &s;uch Thing as Govern|ment among&s;t Men, the &s;tronger would often make Inroads upon the Peace and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the Liberties and the Lives of tho&s;e that were weaker; and univer|&s;al Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order, Mi&s;chiefs and Murthers, and ten Thou&s;and Mi&s;eries would over-&s;pread the Face of the Earth.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In order to this general Good, <HI>viz.</HI> the Pre&s;erva|tion of the Per&s;ons of Men, with their Peace and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; Mankind have been led by the Princi|ples of Rea&s;on and Self-Pre&s;ervation, to join them|&s;elves into di&s;tinct Civil Societies; wherein, as by a Compact, expre&s;&s;ed or implied, every &s;ingle Per&s;on is concerned in the Welfare and Safety of all the re&s;t; and all engage their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to defend any of the Re&s;t, when their Peace or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are invaded; &s;o that by this Means, every &s;ingle Member of the Society has the Wi&s;dom and Strength of the Whole engaged for his Security and Defence: To attain this End mo&s;t happily, different Societies have cho&s;en different Forms of Government, as they thought mo&s;t condu|cive to obtain it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The mo&s;t regular Mixture &s;eems to be that where|in the cho&s;en Repre&s;entatives of the People have their di&s;tinct Share of Government. The Nobles, or great Men, have their Share; and a &s;ingle Per&s;on, or the King, has his Share in this Authority; and all agreed upon by the whole Community. This is called a mixed Monarchy; and herein the&s;e three E&s;tates of the Kingdom, are &s;upported by mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and mutual Limitations; not only to &s;e|cure the common Peace, the Liberty of the Nation from Enemies, but to guard it al&s;o from any dange|rous
<PB N="12" REF="040619_0011_1016715EA6254A10">
Inroads that might be made upon it, by any of the&s;e three Powers them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>Such is the Happine&s;s of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> under the King, Lords, and Commons.</P>
<P><Q>Here let it be noted, That who&s;oever has the Power of making Laws, whether the King, Nobles, or the People, or al the&s;e together; yet &s;till the par|ticular Execution of the&s;e Laws, mu&s;t be committed to many particular Magi&s;trates or Officers; and they are u&s;ually fixed in a Subordination to one another; each of them fulfiling their &s;everal Po&s;ts, throughout the Nation, in order to &s;ecure the general Peace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In all Forms of Government there is, as before hinted, a Compact or Agreement between the Go|vernors and the Governed, expre&s;&s;ed or implied, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Governors &s;hall make it their Care and Bu|&s;ine&s;s to protect the People in their Lives, Liberties and Properties, by re&s;training or puni&s;hing tho&s;e who injure, attack, or a&s;&s;ault them; and that the Gover|ned &s;ubmit to be puni&s;hed, if any of them are found guilty of tho&s;e Practices; and al&s;o that they oblige them&s;elves to pay &s;uch Homage, Honours and Taxes; and yield &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Governors, with their natural Powers, and their Money or Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, as may be&s;t obtain the great Ends of Go|vernment, and the common Safety of the whole Society.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For this Purpo&s;e, therefore, each Per&s;on, by his Compact, willingly abridges him&s;elf of &s;ome Part of his original Liberty or Property, for the common Service of the Society of which he is a Member: And he engages him&s;elf, with his Powers and Capa|city to defend and pre&s;erve the Peace, and Order and Government of the Society, &s;o long as he and his Fellow-Subjects are protected by it, in the Enjoy|ment of all their natural Rights and Liberties. The
<PB N="13" REF="040619_0012_101671612976AF60">
very Rea&s;on of Man, and the Nature of Things, &s;hew us the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch Agreements</Q></P>
<P><Q>From this View of Things it appears, that tho' no particular Form of Government, be&s;ides the antient <HI>Jewi&s;h,</HI> could claim divine Right, yet all Govern|ment is from God, as he is the Author of Rea&s;on and Nature, and the God of Order and Ju&s;tice: And every particular Government which is agreed upon by Men, &s;o far as it retains the original De&s;ign of Government, and faithfully pre&s;erves the Peace and Liberties of Mankind, ought to be &s;ubmitted to, and &s;upported by the Authority of God, our Creator, who, by the Light of Rea&s;on, hath led Mankind in|to Civil Government, in order to their mutual Help and Pre&s;ervation, and Peace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In this Sen&s;e it is, that the two great Apo&s;tle, <HI>Pe|ter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> vindicate Civil Governors, and demand Subjection to them, from Chri&s;tians. Rom. xiii.1. <HI>&amp;c. Let every Soul be &s;ubject to the higher Powers; for there is no Power but of God. The Powers that be, are ordained of God: Who&s;oever, therefore, re&s;i&s;t|eth the Power, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God; and they that re&s;i&s;t, &s;hall receive to them&s;elves Damnation,</HI> (i. e. <HI>are condemn'd;) for Rulers are not a Terror to the good Works, but to the evil.</HI> 1 Pet. ii.13. <HI>Sub|mit your&s;elves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake; whether it be to the King, as &s;upreme, or to Governors, as to them who are &s;ent by him, for the Puni&s;hment of evil Doers, and the Prai&s;e of them that do well.</HI> What St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, is, <HI>ordained of God, i. e.</HI> in general; as Civil Government, or Civil Pow|ers. St. <HI>Peter</HI> calls it <HI>the Ordinance of Man, i. e.</HI> in particular; as to the &s;everal Forms of this Govern|ment, which Men agree upon or appoint: And, in|deed, God has left to Men to agree upon and appoint the particular Forms: And &s;o far as any of them

<P>What Connection there is between this System, and the Con&s;titution of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> let tho&s;e acquainted with it, judge: &mdash; A Con&s;titution envied and admired by every State and Power on Earth; and which No|thing has been able to injure, or ever will be able to injure, but tho&s;e inte&s;tine Encroachments and Divi&s;ions among&s;t them&s;elves; and while the Ballance of that Power, lodged with the three Branches, is kept in a due Poi&s;e, will la&s;t as long as Time la&s;ts. Of this glorious Sy&s;tem we are but a very faint Re&s;emblance; if any at all, it is the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable Part of it, that, <HI>viz.</HI> of encroaching upon the two upper Branches of the Legi|&s;lature; in this we have &s;hewn a good Deal of Dexte|rity. But more of this hereafter.</P>
<P>We are no more than a little Corporation, in the &s;ame Manner as a Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Council are impowered, by his Maje&s;ty's Letters Pa|tent, to form Rules and Orders for the Government of a City, in its &s;everal Wards and Di&s;tricts; even &s;o; tho' in &s;omewhat a higher Degree, and more exten&s;ive Sphere; but all to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e is a Governor, Council and A&s;&s;embly, to govern a Colony, in its &s;e|veral Counties and Precincts, by the &s;ame Power: Every Law or Rule made, that is not peculiarly adapted to their re&s;pective Communities, has no Meaning; and every Law made, that in any Shape cla&s;hes or inter|feres with the Laws of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> are, <HI>ip&s;o Facto,</HI> void. By this I under&s;tand, that the Liberties and Properties of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subjects abroad, e&s;tabli&s;hed and cemented by the Trea&s;ure and Blood of our Ance&s;tors, Time out of Mind, is not left to the Caprice and Hu|mour of a Colony A&s;&s;embly.&mdash;<HI>O Fortunati!</HI> I would not, therefore, advi&s;e our worthy A&s;&s;embly, or their

Leaders, to profane tho&s;e &s;acred Terms, either to frighten or mi&s;lead the Ignorant. Our Liberties and Properties are out of their Reach; they have Nothing to do with them: Every Subject within the King's Dominions, the meane&s;t as well as the greate&s;t, have a Right to the common Law of <HI>England,</HI> and the Great Charter, e&s;tabli&s;hed and confirmed, as Sir <HI>Ed|ward Coke</HI> tells us, by two and thirty Acts of Parlia|ment, and is only declaratory of the fundamental Grounds of the common Law, and no more than a Confirmation or Re&s;titution of the Privileges which were previou&s;ly claimed and due thereby; and all this we were intitled to, before A&s;&s;emblies had a Being, and which our Po&s;terity will enjoy when they are no more. I would, therefore, advi&s;e tho&s;e Gentlemen, for the Future, to drop tho&s;e parliamentary Airs and Stile, about Liberty and Property, and keep within their Sphere, and make the be&s;t U&s;e they can of his Maje&s;ty's In&s;tructions and Commi&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e it would be High-Trea&s;on to &s;it and act without it. This is our Charter; and we may, if we plea&s;e, be extream|ly happy in the Privileges we enjoy from it; that alone, of having it in our Power to tax our&s;elves, is invalu|able; of this, I doubt, we &s;hall never be truly &s;en&s;ible, till, by &s;ome Mi&s;-conduct of our own, we come to lo&s;e it. If we abu&s;e, or make a wicked U&s;e of his Maje|&s;ty's Favours, we are, of them, but Tenants at Will; we only hold them during Plea&s;ure, and good Behaviour. In mo&s;t Corporations, where there appears an Abu&s;e of Power or Neglect of Duty, a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> is nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;et Things to rights; in our Ca&s;e it is not wanted, tho', (as that great Lawyer Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale,</HI> has remarked, in Relation to the I&s;land <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI>) we are Parcel of the Dominions of the Crown of <HI>England</HI>; we are no Part, nor ever were, of the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> but a Peculiar of the Crown; and by a natural and ne|ce&s;&s;ary

Con&s;equence, exempted from parliamentary Aids. Thus you &s;ee our Dependence and the Rea&s;on of it, is altogether upon his Maje&s;ty's Grace and Fa|vour. If we don't approve of our pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem of Government, let us pray for a better: In the mean Time, let us not contemptuou&s;ly treat tho&s;e Favours the Crown has been plea&s;ed already to confer upon us. That this is the Ca&s;e, is but too obvious.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution, or Frame of Government the Crown has been plea&s;ed to favour us with, is by a Go|vernor and Council of his own Appointment; and to which, by his Directions, are added the Repre&s;enta|tives of the People; of which his Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;|&s;ion and In&s;tructions are the Ba&s;is. This is an Emblem, or faint Repre&s;entation of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution; and will, with equal Propriety, an&s;wer all the good Purpo|&s;es intended, if we have but Sagacity enough to make a proper U&s;e of it. Here are three Branches in the Legi&s;lature, who&s;e Powers are &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h|ed and pointed out to them; and while the Ballance is duly kept up, that is, while each of the Branches keep candidly and &s;trictly within its own Sphere of Action, without encroaching, infringing, or maliciou&s;ly endea|vouring, for any particular Ends, to vilify or le&s;&s;en the Powers of any other of the Branches, we may conclude our&s;elves in a happy Way; on the Contrary, if we &s;ee any one of the Branches, a&s;&s;uming to it&s;elf any Part of that Power, originally lodged, and intended by his Ma|je&s;ty to be lodged with the other Branches, and &s;cram|bling vehemently, out of all Mea&s;ure and Character, for more Power than ever was intended it, you may conclude, that every Step taken for that Purpo&s;e, is a Nail in our Coffin, and tends to an Alteration, if not a Di&s;&s;olution of the Con&s;titution. That each, in their Turns, have attempted this, is beyond Di&s;pute. Tho&s;e Attempts from a Governor, can only be by Fits and
<PB N="17" REF="040619_0016_1016716F2A914B08" MS="y">
Starts, out of Pique or Prejudice to Particulars; they cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t: He may be guilty of &s;ome few Acts of Oppre&s;&s;ion; but con&s;idering he has not only the other two Branches of the Legi&s;lature to check him, but even his own Commi&s;&s;ion and In&s;tructions, nay, even the whole Body of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and one particularly adapted to the Purpo&s;e, which makes him accountable in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> for any Mi&s;-conduct here. There Mr. <HI>Lowther</HI> was called to an Account for Acts of Oppre&s;&s;ion, and was like to have payed &s;everely for it, had he not &s;creened him&s;elf by the Act of Grace. He was allowed, upon a regu|lar Complaint, to come home to defend him&s;elf; at the Conclu&s;ion thereof, he was committed by the Council-Board, till he entred into a Recognizance with Sureties <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &pound; 20,000; and was al&s;o ordered to be pro&s;ecuted by the Attorney-General. From hence I would infer, that no Governor, from any Acts of his <HI>qua</HI> Gover|nor, can indanger our Con&s;titution. From a Council we have not much to apprehend, even if they were to join any one of the other Branches, provided the third keeps it's Ground. The Council are in the Nature of Moderators between the Extreams, without who&s;e Concurrence they have no Power to act: Should they, however, neglect their Duty, or abu&s;e the Powers they are intru&s;ted with, they are accountable to his Maje&s;ty, and a Su&s;pen&s;ion &s;oon puts an End to their Being.</P>
<P>From an A&s;&s;embly, if we value our Con&s;titution, we have every Thing to dread; they have the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> on their Side, which greatly preponderates in the Bal|lance, and will be doing (I wi&s;h I could &s;ay fairly) what every other monied Per&s;on does; that is, turn it to their own particular Advantage; and in this Kind of Traffick our A&s;&s;emblies have, of late Years, &s;hown great Dexterity, even &s;o far as greatly to le&s;&s;en that
<PB N="18" REF="040619_0017_10167171368EDBA0">
Dignity and Power, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to Government, lodged with their Superiors, the Governor, and Council; and to add to our Misfortune, there is no Remedy, at pre&s;ent, in Being, to cure this Mi&s;chief, but either a great Al|teration, or a total Di&s;&s;olution of the Con&s;titution; di&s;&s;olving an A&s;&s;embly is none, but the mo&s;t effectual Method to continue the Mi&s;chief: This we may learn, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, from an Adverti&s;ement of their own, or from &s;ome of their Friends, of the 17th of <HI>February,</HI> in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> in the&s;e Words,
<Q>Notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t Efforts of the Court Party had been exerted, yet our two late Members carried the Elections by a very great Majority; and thus, I am per&s;uaded, it will be, &s;hould we have an Election every Month in the Year, for we are determined not to be worried out; and we know our Intere&s;t too well, to be de|ceived either by Paper of Parchment.</Q>
I cannot conceive what this Adverti&s;ement refers to, unle&s;s it be to the King's Commi&s;&s;ion, which, if I mi&s;take not, is on Parchment, as the In&s;tructions are on Paper.</P>
<P>Thus it is evident, a Di&s;&s;olution is no Cure for the Abu&s;e of Power in an A&s;&s;embly: And this brings to my Mind an Ob&s;ervation of a noted Author, on this Point, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That when the Ballance of Power is duly fixed in a State, Nothing is more dangerous or un|wi&s;e, than to give Way to the fir&s;t Steps of popular Encroachments; which is u&s;ually done, either in Hopes of procuring Ea&s;e and Quiet from &s;ome vex|atious Clamour, or el&s;e made Merchandize, and merely bought and &s;old. This is the breaking into a Con&s;titution to &s;erve a pre&s;ent Expedient, or &s;upply a pre&s;ent Exigency; the Remedy of an Empirick, to &s;tifle the pre&s;ent Pain, but with certain Pro&s;pect of &s;udden and terrible Returns. When a Child grows ea&s;y and content by being humour'd; and when a Lover becomes &s;atisfied&punc; by &s;mall Compliances, with|out

further Pur&s;uits; then expect to find popular A&s;&s;emblies content with &s;mall Conce&s;&s;ions. If there could one &s;ingle Example be brought, from the whole Compa&s;s of Hi&s;tory, of any one popular A&s;&s;embly, who, after beginning to contend for Power, ever &s;at down quietly with a certain Share; or if one In&s;tance could be produced, of a popular A&s;&s;embly, that ever knew, or propo&s;ed, or declared what Share of Power was their Due; then might there be &s;ome Hopes, that it were a Matter to be adju&s;ted by Rea&s;onings, by Conferences, or Debates: But &s;ince all this is ma|nife&s;tly otherwi&s;e, I &s;ee no Cour&s;e to be taken, in a &s;ettled State, but a &s;teady, con&s;tant Re&s;olution, in tho&s;e to whom the Re&s;t of the Ballance of Power is intru&s;ted, never to give Way &s;o far, to popular Cla|mours, as to make the lea&s;t Breach in the Con&s;titu|tion, through which a Million of Abu&s;es and En|croachments, will certainly, in Time, force their Way.</Q></P>

<P><Q>Mo&s;t of the Revolutions of Government, in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> began from the Abu&s;e of Power in tho&s;e &s;elected for the Pre&s;ervation of the People; which generally ended in the Tyranny of a &s;ingle Per&s;on. This &s;hews the People are their own Dupes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Romans</HI> cho&s;e Legi&s;lators to pick up the be&s;t Laws wherever they were to be found, and to dige&s;t them into Order; and during the Exerci&s;e of their Office, &s;u&s;pended the Con&s;ular Power: But they &s;oon affected kingly State, de&s;troyed the Nobles, and oppre&s;&s;ed the People.</Q></P>

<Q>The <HI>Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">eri</HI> in <HI>Sparta</HI> u&s;urped the ab&s;olute Authori|ty, and were as cruel Tyrants as any in their Ages.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Athenians</HI> cho&s;e four Hundred Men for the Admini&s;tration of Affairs, who became a Body of Tyrants: They murdered, in cold Blood, great Numbers of the be&s;t Men, without any Provocation, for the mere Lu&s;t of Cruelty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In <HI>Carthage</HI> the Ballance of Power got &s;o far on the Side of the People, as to bring their Government to a <HI>Dominatio Plebis</HI>; as was that of <HI>Rome,</HI> at la&s;t, which ended in the Tyranny of the <HI>Cae&s;ars.</HI> Thus it may appear, Tyranny is not confined to Numbers.</Q></P>
<P>Now, if I may be allowed to compare &s;mall Things with great&punc; if it evidently appears, that tho&s;e great and free and independent States, lo&s;t their Liberties from an over Ballance of Power, u&s;urped by their po|pular A&s;&s;emblies; and if I can &s;hew, that our little, diminutive, dependent States are following that Ex|ample, as fa&s;t as ever they can; and that the &s;ame Cau&s;es eternally produce the &s;ame Effects; I hope I &s;hall be intitled to the Thanks of &s;ome of my thought|le&s;s, unwary Country-men; and tho' it may not affect us in &s;o fatal a Manner, our Liberty being, (as before mentioned) otherwi&s;e &s;ecured; yet it mu&s;t infallibly indanger our Con&s;titution: We are but yet, as it were, in the Hands of the Potter; in a probationary State of Go<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d-Behaviour; if we totter upon three Legs, he can add or dimini&s;h, or turn us off in what-ever Shape he plea&s;es; and who dare &s;ay, <HI>What doe&s;t thou?</HI></P>

We have, from the Infancy of Times here, been nur&s;ed up and indulged, at an infinite Expence to the Crown, and

People of <HI>England:</HI> Even at this Day, they are at the Expence of &pound;. 10,000 Sterling, yearly; and have been at no le&s;s, for any Thing I know, every Year ever &s;ince we had a Being, for our Pre&s;ervation. We are exempted from all parliamentary Aids; we have never added any Thing to the Revenue of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as &s;ome of our Neighbour Colonies have done, of im|men&s;e Sums: Our Plan of Government is from that of <HI>Old-England</HI>; the mo&s;t complete Sy&s;tem known; to which, if any Additions can po&s;&s;ibly be made, we have it in our Power to make them: We have it in our Power to tax our&s;elves, as Conveniency &s;utes; which bears no Proportion to tho&s;e Taxes paid by a like Number of our Fellow-Subjects, in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Can mortal Men expect, then, to be happier? or any rea&s;onable Man or &s;et of Men, wi&s;h for, or endeavour at a Change?</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee what grateful Returns we have made, on our Parts, for tho&s;e Favours.</P>
<P>A general Retro&s;pection into the Proceedings of our A&s;&s;embly, is a Ta&s;k I have neither Inclination nor Lei&s;ure to undertake; and &s;hall, therefore, leave it to tho&s;e who may hereafter have the Curio&s;ity to collect the Debates of that Hou&s;e, for the Benefit of the Com|munity; and &s;hall only content my&s;elf with giving a &s;hort Specimen of their Conduct for &mdash; Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ion and In&s;tructions directed to his Excellency the Governor, but intended for the Good of the Whole; which, by the Bye, I cannot help thinking, that if they were in every Body's Hands. as a Family-Piece or Hou&s;e Bible, and not cooped up like the <HI>Sibylline Oracles,</HI> to which Recour&s;e was only had upon extraordinary Emergency, it might be of mighty U&s;e; the People would become acquainted and in Love with their Con&s;titution! they would there &s;ee&punc; through the Whole, the benevolent Intentions of our

<P>Thus by wicked In&s;truments, for wicked Purpo&s;es, are weak Minds impo&s;ed upon; for who&s;e Sake I &s;hall endeavour to explain the Word, which, I doubt, is but ill under&s;tood, even by tho&s;e the Perverters of it: If I am mi&s;taken, I &s;hall readily &s;tand corrected.</P>
<P>There is, in every Family, a Sort of Government without any fixed Rules; and indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible, even in a little Family, to form Rules for every Cir|cum&s;tance; and therefore it is better conceived than expre&s;&s;ed; but perfectly under&s;tood by every Indivi|dual belonging to the Family. The Study of the Fa|ther or Ma&s;ter, is for the Good of the Whole; all Ap|peals are to him; he has a Power, from the Rea&s;on and Nature of Things, to check the In&s;olent, or Indolent, and to encourage the Indu&s;trious: In &s;hort, the whole Affairs of the Family are immediately under the Care or Direction of the Father or Ma&s;ter; and this is a natural Prerogative, known and acknowledged by every Man living, who has ever had a Family, or been any Ways concerned in a Family, in all Ages and in all Places. His Maje&s;ty, as he is our political Father, his political Prerogative, from the like Circum&s;tances and Rea&s;ons, is equally nece&s;&s;ary. And this political Authority has been allowed the &s;upreme Director, in all States, in all Ages, and in all Places; and without it, there would be a Failure of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In the Commi&s;&s;ion and In&s;tructions, as I was ob|&s;erving, there are &s;ome Powers in the Crown, which it cannot dive&s;t it&s;elf of, that, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Militia, Guards, and Garri&s;ons; and tho' his Maje&s;ty has given
<PB N="23" REF="040619_0022_1016717FB7536808">
particular Directions for the Regulation of the Militia here, (a Part &s;o e&s;&s;ential to every State and Govern|ment) yet our late worthy A&s;&s;embly thought fit to drop it altogether; for which, as they have given us no Rea&s;ons, they mu&s;t give us Leave to gue&s;s; and I think there can be but two, that, <HI>viz.</HI> of le&s;&s;ening the Power of the Captain General; or that the Road to tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions, is not generally through the A&s;|&s;embly-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It is plain the Intention of the Crown, in our Con|&s;titution, was to bring it up, as near as po&s;&s;ible, to that of the original Plan. All Monies rai&s;ed by Parliament, are i&s;&s;ued by Warrant from the Lords of the Trea&s;ury. His Maje&s;ty has been plea&s;ed to direct, that all Mo|nies rai&s;ed in the Colonies, &s;hall be i&s;&s;ued by Warrant under the Hand of the Governor in Council. What due Regard has been paid to this In&s;truction, is noto|rious, and the Rea&s;on plain; becau&s;e, otherwi&s;e, the A&s;&s;embly would, in a great Mea&s;ure, lo&s;e tho&s;e Ap|plications for Gratification of Services done, or preten|ded to be done, by their Friends and Dependents; of which they take upon them&s;elves to be the &s;ole Judges, in Derogation of the Power lodged with the other Branches of the Legi&s;lature, and Violation of his Ma|je&s;ty's Commands.</P>
<P>This will appear in a clearer Light, from the Pro|ceeding of our late A&s;&s;embly, and the Council's Ad|dre&s;s to his Excellency, upon that Point; to which I beg Leave to refer. But, as I have met with an Ad|dre&s;s in the Proceedings of a neighbouring Colony, up|on the &s;ame Subject, done with great Spirit and Accu|racy, I &s;hall make no other Apology for in&s;erting &s;o much of it, as relates to the Subject; and is as follows&punc;</P>

<P><Q>All which the Council would have left out of the Bill; and an unan&s;werable Argument, why they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in&s;i&s;t upon their being left out, the Mem|bers of Council think proper to in&s;ert, immediately after tho&s;e Words in the Bill, the King's thirty-fourth In&s;truction to the Governor; by which they appre|hend it will, at fir&s;t View, appear what a direct Op|po&s;ition there is in one to the other.

<P><Q>The&s;e Words in the In&s;tructions, the Council think too plain and full to be mi&s;under&s;tood; and that they are not capable of any other Meaning than that ge|nuine, in which they have been, and are taken by the Members of this Board; who cannot, therefore, &s;uffer them&s;elves to be taught otherwi&s;e.

<Q>Such Contrarieties as the&s;e, betwixt the Royal Plea&s;ure, &s;ignified in the In&s;tructions, and that of the General A&s;&s;embly, may well be thought enough, without any more, to determine the Opinion of this Board; and no better Rea&s;on, certainly, can be ex|pected from the Members of his Maje&s;ty's Council, for their refu&s;ing their A&s;&s;ent to any Bill, than that the pa&s;&s;ing of it would be contrary to the King's In|&s;tructions. But as the Members of the Council are a&s;&s;ured, that the Gentlemen of the A&s;&s;embly are go|ing upon a great and dangerous Mi&s;take; and that they are now aiming at what can have no other Ten|dency (tho' we do not charge them with any &s;uch Intention) than to &s;ubvert the Con&s;titution of the I&s;land, as &s;ettled by his Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ion and In&s;tructions, and to render the Council altogether unu&s;eful in the Government; they cannot pa&s;s over this Head without ob&s;erving, that this Attempt of the A&s;&s;embly, is not only a bold Innovation here, but is al&s;o very contrary to the U&s;age of Parliaments in <HI>England</HI>; where, tho' it is admitted, that bills of Aids and Sub&s;idies do generally begin with the Com|mons, and they u&s;ually lay the Rates and Duties on Merchandize, yet they have Nothing to do with the Application of the Money, as far as we may pre&s;ume to judge by their Practice. If they are afterwards appri&s;ed of any Mi&s;applications or Abu&s;es, the Me|thod is, to addre&s;s the King, (as the A&s;&s;embly may do here) that the &s;everal Officers concerned in the &s;ame, do lay the Accounts before the Hou&s;e, that they may examine into them, and be therefore enabled to take &s;uitable Mea&s;ures for bringing the Offenders to con|dign Puni&s;hment, or for preventing the like Abu&s;es for the Future; but that is all.

<P><Q>The Members of the Council would be glad to know what there is in the Nature of tho&s;e Accounts, that they may not be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of judging of them, as well as the A&s;&s;embly? or why this Board may not be pre&s;umed to have as tender a Regard for the Intere&s;t of the I&s;land, and to the due Di&s;po&s;ition of its publick Money, as the A&s;&s;embly?

<P><Q>The ninth Amendment is to the following Cl&aacute;u&s;e of the Bill, <HI>viz.</HI>

Which Clau&s;e di&s;covering the &s;ame Spirit of Encroachment with the la&s;t, the Council found it nece&s;&s;ary to alter, and in&s;tead thereof, to in&s;ert what follows, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>For the Pay|ment
<PB N="29" REF="040619_0028_10167192511D0AE0">
of the Salary of &s;uch Agent or Agents of this I&s;land, in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as &s;hall or may, at any Time hereafter, be appointed, and given by any Law for that Purpo&s;e.</Q>
And this, they apprehended, would an&s;wer all the good Purpo&s;es of the other, with|out being liable to any of the Objections. By the&s;e Words, if the Legi&s;lature, at any Time during the Continuance of the Act, judge it proper to have A|gents for the publick Service, here is sufficient Provi|&s;ion made to pay them out of the publick Money: But the Council could not, nor can on any Account, con&s;ent to the Clau&s;e, as it &s;tands in the Bill; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e the Money is not to be paid but upon the Ad|dre&s;s of the A&s;&s;embly: <HI>Secondly,</HI> For that the Words are too general and indefinite; <HI>for the Payment of &s;uch Sum or Sums of Money, as &s;hall, from Time to Time,</HI> &amp;c. whereby the A&s;&s;embly might have it in their Power to give away immen&s;e Sums for that Purpo&s;e, or under that Pretence: <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Becau&s;e the Money is made payable to &s;uch Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, as the pre|&s;ent General A&s;&s;embly &s;hall or may appoint to be their Agents. And here the Members of his Maje&s;ty's Council cannot forbear expre&s;&s;ing their Amazement, that the Gentlemen of the A&s;&s;embly &s;hould take up|on them&s;elves to appoint Agents of their own, as they call them, when, at the &s;ame Time, they &s;ay, it is <HI>to negotiate, tran&s;act, and carry on the publick Af|fairs of this I&s;land, in</HI> Great-Britain&punc; What! are all tho&s;e publick Affairs to be carried on by their Agents, without any Concern of the Governor and Council? Mu&s;t the&s;e have no Hand at all in directing and in|&s;tructing &s;uch Agents, in what will be for the publick Benefit; and the Money, notwith&s;tanding, even unli|mited Sums, be implicitly paid, by their Allowance? What is this but to a&s;&s;ume, in Effect, an arbitrary and independent Power, and &s;o far to render the

&mdash;<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Event of this Affair was, that the Bill, or a Draught of the Bill, with the Council's Rea&s;ons for their Amendments, were &s;ent Home; and the Gover|nor &s;oon received an Order, grounded on a Report of the Honourable the Committee of his Maje&s;ty's Privy-Council, for rejecting the Draught of the Bill, as con|trary to the con&s;tant U&s;age of that I&s;land, and of all other his Maje&s;ty's Colonies, and derogatory to the Royal Prerogative; which being expre&s;sly &s;aid to be advi&s;ed by their Lord&s;hips, with Intent to di&s;courage Attempts of the like Kind for the Future.</P>
<P>While the&s;e Matters were in Agitation at <HI>Barbados,</HI> the &s;ame Di&s;putes were carried on in <HI>New-England,</HI> but, if po&s;&s;ible, with &s;till more Ob&s;tinacy, tho' with &s;omewhat more Colour of Rea&s;on, becau&s;e of their Charter, which they pretended was infringed by the In|&s;tructions: They, therefore, were not &s;atisfied with the Royal Determination, but thought fit to apply to the Parliament; as appears from the printed Votes of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>

<P>To this I have only to add, by Way of <HI>Query</HI>; &mdash; Should an A&s;&s;embly, cho&s;e by the People as Tru&s;tees and Guardians of their Con&s;titution and Privileges, af|ter &s;o clear a Declaration of his Maje&s;ty's Sentiments, continue to in&s;ult his Maje&s;ty's Government, by con|temptuou&s;ly rejecting every Order and In&s;truction that does not &s;ute their Ta&s;te or Humour? And are they not accountable to the People, for the Con&s;equences of their Conduct? Surely no One can think otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall go on to &s;hew, in a few more Particulars, the Intention of the Crown, in forming us upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plan.</P>
<P>The Bill for the Payment of the Debts of the Go|vernment, has been &s;ufficiently animadverted upon, by the Addre&s;s of the Council here, as well as what may be collected from that other of <HI>Barbados.</HI> The Ap|plication Act, as it is called, comes next to be con&s;ide|red: It is, indeed, an Original; and from the very Face of it, appears to be calculated in direct Oppo&s;ition to his Maje&s;ty's In&s;tructions, and the very Form and Nature of our Con&s;titution: Every Officer of the Go|vernment is there named by the A&s;&s;embly, with his Allowance tacked to the End of it; which being a
<PB N="32" REF="040619_0031_1016719A5260E520">
Money Bill, is, with them, &s;acred and not to be touched with profane Hands; and with this Provi&s;o too, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That if any of them die or are removed, &s;o much of the afore&s;aid Allowances to be paid, as &s;hall be at that Time due; and no more.</Q>
If an Officer, then, dies or is removed, the Governor, it is true, may put ano|ther in his Place; but he can have no Salary or Allow|ance, till the A&s;&s;embly plea&s;e; and that Allowance is ju&s;t as they plea&s;e to like the Per&s;on. It is not a new Thing with &s;ome of our A&s;&s;emblies, to add or &s;ub&s;tract a Figure in the Salary of of the Officers, according to the Nature of the Application; and even to drop an u&s;eful Office, upon Occa&s;ion, if they di&s;approve of the Officer; witne&s;s the Weigh-Ma&s;ter General's Office. This, I think, is an Encroachment with a Witne&s;s, as it creates a Dependence of all the Officers of the Go|vernment, upon an A&s;&s;embly; which, of Cour&s;e, quite inverts the very Order and Nature of Government.</P>
<P>In <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to defray the nece&s;&s;ary Services of the Government, E&s;timates are laid before the Hou&s;e of Commons, of which they, if they plea&s;e, may judge of the Nece&s;&s;ity, as well as of the <HI>Quantum</HI>; the Funds, however, are rai&s;ed; but the Application is left to his Maje&s;ty. If there are any Mi&s;applications, it is with the Commons to enquire; and Nothing is more dreaded, than a parliamentary Scrutiny.</P>
<P>The Di&s;po&s;ition of Officers, is an inherent Right of the Crown; and is, indeed, a Part of that Power lodg|ed in that Branch of the Legi&s;lature, in order to keep up the Ballance; and without it, it would lo&s;e of its Weight. It is his Maje&s;ty's Intentions, that we &s;hould follow the &s;ame Method; but, tho&s;e Intentions our A&s;&s;emblies have treated according to their u&s;ual Com|plai&s;ance.</P>
<P>The proper Appointments of the Civil Li&s;t, for his Maje&s;ty's Support, is for Life; which, from long Ex|perience,
<PB N="33" REF="040619_0032_1016719BE4B67000">
is found mo&s;t conducive to the Benefit of the Community.</P>
<P>It is his Maje&s;ty's Royal Will and Plea&s;ure, that there be paid to his Governor and Captain General, &pound;. 1200 Sterling, yearly, out of his Revenue ari&s;ing in his &s;aid Province; and it is his expre&s;s Will and Plea&s;ure, that all Laws made for the Supply and Sup|port of Government, be indefinite, and without Limi|tation, as to Point of Time: As the Commi&s;&s;ion is, the Meaning I think is plain, that it &s;hould la&s;t, at lea&s;t, as long as the Commi&s;&s;ion; and in this Sen&s;e, mo&s;t of tho&s;e Colonies immediately under his Maje&s;ty's Direction, have taken it; and accordingly, as I am in|formed, ob&s;erve it, and enjoy Peace and the Favour of the Crown, while <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> are, at pre&s;ent, famous all over his Maje&s;ty's Dominions, for worrying one another, and Contempt of Royal Orders and In&s;tructions: But in&s;tead of this, our A&s;&s;embly tell him he may take &pound;. 1200, if he plea&s;es, but it &s;hall be at 40 <HI>per C.</HI> Di&s;count; and even that, but from Year to Year; it is this or Nothing; there is no Alternate. This, however, is paying no great Compliment to his Maje&s;ty's expre&s;s Royal Will and Plea&s;ure, and but poor Returns of Gratitude for <HI>Ten Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> Sterling, laid out upon us yearly, by his Maje&s;ty. That of a yearly Support is but of a late Standing; it was not &s;o from the Beginning. From this Period, however, we may date the Commence|ment of all our Confu&s;ions. Five Years was the com|mon Method; and I believe I may challenge the mo&s;t &s;anguine Party-Man, to point out any dreadful Con&s;e|quences that attended it. This, I &s;ay, was the Method, this ought to be the Method, and this will be the Me|thod, however terrible, at pre&s;ent, it may appear; and if we do not follow it, it will be done to our Hands; or we &s;hall have no Peace in o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">r <HI>Israel,</HI> and the King no Government.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="040619_0033_1016719D782922E0">Can any Thing be more ab&s;urd, than to imagine a Governor, &s;ent abroad to govern a People, and to be &s;upported according to the Dignity of his Office, and under certain Re&s;trictions and In&s;tructions, e&s;&s;ential to that Government; but to obtain that Support, every In&s;truction mu&s;t be given up, one after another, or have no Support? which is ju&s;t throwing the Gover|nor into their Hands: This has been the Practice for many Years, and his Maje&s;ty and his Mini&s;ters know it too; what the Event will be, Time only can di&s;co|ver. Some Remedy mu&s;t be found, or the People will at la&s;t govern.</P>
<P>A Governor is no &s;ooner appointed, than the fir&s;t Que&s;tion is, Into who&s;e Hands &s;hall I throw my&s;elf? the An&s;wer is ready, Into who&s;e but &s;uch as can be&s;t manage the A&s;&s;embly. Hence Prime Mini&s;ters and Courtiers are e&s;tabli&s;hed; and, of Cour&s;e, Anti-cour|tiers: Hence Parties are formed; and thus the Peace of the Publick is de&s;troyed, hone&s;t Neighbours &s;et to|gether by the Ears, and all Good-fellow&s;hip excluded the Society; Elections are carried on with great Ani|mo&s;ity, and at a va&s;t Expence, as if our Alls were at Stake: And what is all this for? Is the publick Good really the Point in View? or is it to &s;hew how dexte|rou&s;ly the one Side can manage the A&s;&s;embly for him, and the other again&s;t him? Let us be told what mighty Advantage the Publick has reaped from that repeated Round of Squabbles we have been pe&s;tred with, with no other View than to di&s;tre&s;s a worthy Gentleman.</P>
<P>Thus, I think, the Rea&s;onablene&s;s, and even the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;upporting a Governor, according to his Maje&s;ty's Royal Will and Plea&s;ure, that is independent|ly of any Body but him&s;elf, is evident, as it will de&s;troy all tho&s;e Sources of Contention.</P>

<P>A gentle Tax upon Lands here, would an&s;wer all the&s;e Purpo&s;es, relieve the Merchant, and encourage Trade, at this Time in a langui&s;hing Condition.</P>
<P>If a Man of Worth and Honour falls to our Share, (which indeed, as Matters &s;tand at pre&s;ent, we can hard|ly expect) he will, if &s;upported according to his Dig|nity, naturally incline to do us all the good Offices in his Power, if we our&s;elves don't take Pains to prevent him; and he, the Council, and General A&s;&s;embly, will have that Time, hitherto &s;pent in trifling Squab|bles, to think of &s;ecuring us from abroad, and encou|raging Trade and Indu&s;try at home.</P>
<P>The Manner of our &s;upporting our Judges, is equal|ly ridiculous and ab&s;urd. It is agreed on all Hands, that tho&s;e Offices ought to be held for Life, indepen|dent both of Crown and People, and under no Bias; but our A&s;&s;embly are determined to keep them too, under their Thumbs; and tell them, we will allow &s;o much for this Year, but if you do not behave as we think you &s;hould do, we will give you le&s;s next Year, and perhaps Nothing at all. This would have little Weight with a Man of Fortune and Integrity, in that Office; but might prove too powerful a Temptation to &s;uch as have Nothing el&s;e to depend upon. As the Commi&s;&s;ions, therefore, for good Rea&s;ons, are for Life; &s;o ought, for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, the Salaries to be.</P>
<P>I have been informed, that in <HI>New-England,</HI> there was a long Debate in the Hou&s;e, whether the Gover|nor's Salary &s;hould be paid at the Beginning or at the End of the Year, that they might be the better able to judge of his Good-Behaviour; and, if I am not mi&s;|taken, it was carried for the latter.</P>

<P>There are Twenty-&s;even A&s;&s;embly-men, to whom the Law allows to &s;ome <HI>Ten,</HI> to &s;ome <HI>Six,</HI> and to o|thers, <HI>Four Shillings</HI> a Day; take the Medium at 7 <HI>&s;.</HI> and this amounts to &pound;. 9:9:0, every Day from their &s;etting out, to their Return to their Homes; and this is a Tax immediately out of the Farmers Pockets; all others are upon the Merchant (a Point that may be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed at another Time;) be&s;ides &pound;. 300 to a Trea|&s;urer, yearly, tho' his Maje&s;ty has appointed one for that Purpo&s;e, and &pound;. 200, yearly, to an Agent of their own. The Incidents on both Sides may be left out in the Computation. We &s;hall be told, perhaps, that &s;ome of the&s;e Gentlemen, don't take up their Allow|ance; but &s;ure They won't openly declare this, becau&s;e, in my humble Opinion, it is down-right Bribery, as I cannot conceive the Difference between &s;aying, I will <HI>give</HI> you &s;even Shillings a Day, if you chu&s;e me; or, I will <HI>forgive</HI> you &s;even Shillings a Day, if you chu&s;e me. &mdash;So much for this extraordinary Act.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, out of a tender Regard for the Pre&s;er|vation of the Lives and Properties of his Subjects here, has given Directions, that proper Provi&s;ion be made for Indian Affairs; but our worthy A&s;&s;embly, that

their Conduct may appear of a Piece, have made none; I &s;hall not enquire into the Rea&s;ons; they ought, in|deed, to be very good Ones, to &s;atisfy the People; becau&s;e, in Ca&s;e of a Rupture with <HI>France,</HI> it mu&s;t have very fatal Con&s;equences; and it is not impo&s;&s;ible, (con&s;idering how indefatigable the <HI>French</HI> are in this Matter) but that <HI>Fre&s;h-Water</HI> may become our Fron|tier: I can &s;ee Nothing to hinder them, without our Indians, from driving the whole Country in before them. How far the Authors of this Neglect may be an&s;werable for tho&s;e Con&s;equences, at the great Day of Accounts, I am not Ca&s;ui&s;t enough to determine; and &s;hall, therefore, leave it to their own Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>I have but one Thing more to ob&s;erve upon, in this Act, and that is, That neither Governor nor Council can command one Shilling of the publick Money, if that Shilling would &s;ave the Province, while the Spea|ker has it in his Power, by Order of the Hou&s;e, to di&s;po&s;e of it as he plea&s;es, without being accountable to any but them&s;elves.&mdash;<HI>See the la&s;t Clau&s;e but one, in the Act.</HI>&mdash;How con&s;i&s;tent this is with the Nature of our Con&s;titution, or, indeed, any other Con&s;titution, I &s;hall leave to tho&s;e more judicious to determine.</P>
<P>As I have but little Hopes of any Remedy for tho&s;e Evils, on this Side of the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> I would have it e|nacted, by a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, That whereas great Ir|regularities and Confu&s;ions have ari&s;en from the pre&s;ent Methods taken for the Support of Government, and Officers of the Crown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Be it Enacted,</HI> That all Lands hitherto granted, or that &s;hall be granted by his Maje&s;ty, &s;hall pay at the Rate of <HI>One Shilling</HI> for every Hundred Acres, up|on Oath, in Lieu of all other Rents or Re&s;ervations what&s;oever; applicable only towards the Support of Government and the Officers of the Crown; to be i&s;|&s;ued by Warrant, according to In&s;tructions.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="040619_0037_101671A98FDDCC50">As to what may be objected in Relation to the giving up the Quit-Rents; they are but a Trifle to the Crown, and will ever be a Canker in the E&s;tate of the Subject. From 1664 to 1710, they are but of very little Importance. The Counties of <HI>New-York, We&s;t-Che&s;ter, Dutche&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Albany,</HI> that is, all the Ea&s;t Side of <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River, extending along the Ri|ver about 170 Miles, does not, by an accurate Calcu|lation, pay above &pound;. 90 Sterling, to be collected from &s;everal Thou&s;and Hands. The Re&s;t of the Counties are much upon the &s;ame Footing; and I may, I think, venture to affirm, that, had it not been for the vacating two Grants; one, <HI>viz.</HI> to Mr. <HI>Evans,</HI> and the other to <HI>Dell<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> and <HI>Bayard</HI>; the Quit-Rents would not have defrayed the Expence of collecting them; nor would the Province have been half &s;o well &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Governors, during that Period, were under no Re|&s;trictions. Grants of Lands, and Re&s;ervations, were in Proportion to the Gratifications to a Governor. The greate&s;t Part of the Grants, during that Time, are to pay &s;uch Quit-Rents, as hereafter &s;hall be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by the Laws of this Country; which is ju&s;t &s;aying, you &s;hall pay when you plea&s;e. There are, however, &s;ome Pepper-Corns, &s;ome Wampum, Sti|vers, and Beaver-Skins a&s;certained.</P>
<P>Since 1710, 2 <HI>&s;</HI> 6 is re&s;erved upon every Hun|dred Acres; but as Grants are not ea&s;ily come at by a poor Man, the Rich have generally engro&s;&s;ed them, not with a View of &s;ettling the Lands, but of parcelling of them out to the be&s;t Bidders. Tho&s;e Grants, and, of Cour&s;e, the Re&s;ervations, by the&s;e Means became &s;o divided and &s;ubdivided, that at la&s;t, it will become impracticable, if not impo&s;&s;ible, either for the Officer to collect, or the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to pay, tho' never &s;o willing, with any Certainty or Regularity. In many of the old Grants, the Shares of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors
<PB N="39" REF="040619_0038_101671ADDF351AF0">
does not amount to the tenth Part of a Penny; and they mu&s;t go perhaps a great Way to pay that, or be pro&s;ecuted; or if any one of them &s;hould even be o|bliged to pay the Whole, they have no Remedy again&s;t tho&s;e concerned. A poor Man in the <HI>Moba<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ok</HI>'s Coun|try, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, perhaps, of fifty Acres, mu&s;t go up|wards of two Hundred Miles every Year, to pay fif|teen Pence, or be pro&s;ecuted; the Event of which may be fatal to &s;uch a Per&s;on. This will, in Time, create great Uncertainty and Confu&s;ion in that Collec|tion. In Lieu, therefore, of which, I humbly conceive, that <HI>One Shilling</HI> upon every Hundred Acres, would relieve the Subjects, amply &s;upport Government, the Officers of the Crown would become independent of A&s;&s;emblies, Trade would be relieved, and tho&s;e extra|vagant landed Gentlemen, would be obliged to pay their Proportion of that Expence.</P>
<P>From good Hands I under&s;tand, that a Per&s;on po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of two Hundred Acres, pays more to the Pub|blick, than &s;ome of tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their Hundred Thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>In order to put our Indian Affairs upon a proper Footing, I would have all Monies, rai&s;ed upon the Retailers of Liquors, (being a Sort of a voluntary Tax through the whole Continent be made a perpetual and unalienable Fund for that Purpo&s;e. If this Affair, of &s;o much Importance to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, be left much longer to the Caprice of A&s;&s;emblies, we may ea|&s;ily gue&s;s what will be the Con&s;equence. And that all Duties upon Indian Goods cea&s;e, and the Trade left open to all his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, except tho&s;e that take the Road to <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>As I conceize, that Trade carried on between <HI>Albany</HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> is attended with very pernicious Con&s;e|quences to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, I cannot help thinking, with Submi&s;&s;ion, but that an effectual Stop might be

put to it by the following Method. By the 12th of <HI>Ch.</HI> II. no Alien, or Per&s;on not born within the King's Allegiance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hall exerci&s;e the Trade or Occupation of a Merchant or Factor in any of his Maje&s;ty's Plantations, upon Forfeiture of all his Goods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Let an Officer, therefore, be po&s;ted at <HI>Albany,</HI> who is to publi&s;h the above Clau&s;e; giving Notice, that in three Months, all Goods, Wares, or Merchandize ex|ported or imported, from or to <HI>Albany,</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> or their Factors, the Natives, not under his Maje&s;ty's Allegiance, will be &s;eized; the Proof to be put upon the Owner.</P>
<P>There are two Objections to this; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> If the <HI>French</HI> are not &s;upplied from us, they will fall upon other Means of &s;upplying them&s;elves, which will pre|judice the Con&s;umption of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures: But the Ab&s;urdity of this Objection has already been &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed, (<HI>See the Papers relating to an</HI> Act <HI>of the A&s;&s;embly of the Province of</HI> New-York, for En|couragement of the Indian Trade, <HI>&amp;c. and</HI> for prohi|biting the &s;elling of Indian Goods to the <HI>French,</HI> viz. <HI>of</HI> Canada; <HI>and Mr.</HI> Colden<HI>'s</HI> Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Five Nations</HI>) I &s;hall take no further Notice of it.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd Objection, that this will be acting contrary to that Freedom of Commerce with the In|dians, mutually &s;tipulated by the Articles of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI>; to this I have only to &s;ay, that the <HI>French</HI> under&s;tand not that Treaty in &s;uch Light; as appears by their di&s;charging our Traders from trading, upon any Pretence whatever, within their Territories, under &s;evere Penalties; witne&s;s the Treatment tho&s;e three <HI>Philadelphia</HI> Traders met with lately, for trading at <HI>Ohio,</HI> only pretended to be within their Territories; whereas neither <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nor Indians, admit it to be &s;o; and the <HI>Ohio</HI> Indians will &s;uffer all the Extremities of War rather than admit it to be &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="040619_0040_101671B2F9B18800">By this Time, I pre&s;ume, I am reckoned a mighty Governor's Man, (an invidious Di&s;tinction) and no Friend to A&s;&s;embly-men.

<P>As to A&s;&s;embly-men, there are tho&s;e whom I re|vere. One who&s;e only Aim is at the Honour, Safety, and Intere&s;t of his Country; and who on this Mark con&s;tantly keeps his Eye fixed; who dreads not the Frowns of an enraged Governor, or the horrid Cla|mours of a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Multitude; who &s;miles to &s;ee &s;o many (in all Appearance) hone&s;t and thinking Men, jog on like a Gang of Pack-Hor&s;es; who truly enjoys all that Freedom in his Actions, which he thinks his Duty to procure for, and defend his Country-men in; One, in &s;hort, who is directed, influenced, or bia&s;&s;ed by none; and while he is in his Country's Service, thinks the mo&s;t glorious Epithets the World can fix up|on him, are tho&s;e of a rigid, inflexible, ill-natur'd, hone&s;t Man.&mdash;And &s;uch a one who would not revere?</P>
<P>But, as a certain Gentleman ob&s;erves:
<Q>I think, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> there is hardly to be found through all Na|ture, a greater Difference between a repre&s;enting Commoner in the Function of his publick Calling, and the &s;ame Per&s;on, when he acts in the common Offices of Life; here he allows him&s;elf to be on a Level with the Re&s;t of Mortals; here he follows his own Rea&s;on and his own Way; in &s;hort, here his Folly and his Wi&s;dom, his Rea&s;on, and his Pa&s;&s;ions, are

all of his own Growth, not the Echo of other Men: But when he is got near the Walls of his A&s;&s;embly, he a&s;&s;umes and affects an intire Set of very different Airs; he conceives him&s;elf a Being of a &s;uperior Na|ture to tho&s;e without, and acting in a Sphere where the vulgar Methods for the Conduct of Life, can be of no U&s;e: He's li&s;ted in a Party where he neither knows the Temper nor De&s;igns, nor perhaps the Leader; but who&s;e Opinions he follows and maintains with a Zeal and Faith, as violent as a young <HI>White|fieldian</HI> does tho&s;e of a Methodi&s;t, who&s;e Sect he is taught to profe&s;s: He has neither Opinions, nor Thoughts, nor Actions, nor Talk, that he can call his own; but all conveyed to him by his Leader, as Wind is through an Organ: The Nouri&s;hment he receives, has not only been chewed, but dige&s;ted be|fore it comes into his Mouth: Thus in&s;tructed, he follows the Party, right or wrong, thro' all its Sen|timents, and acquires a Courage and Stiffne&s;s of O|pinion, not at all congenial with him.</Q>
Such a One, if any &s;uch there be, I mo&s;t heartily de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
