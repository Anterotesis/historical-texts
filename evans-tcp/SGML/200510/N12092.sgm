<P>THE laudable <HI>In&s;titution,</HI> made by the worthy Inhabitants of this ancient TOWN, for celebrating the wonder-working pro|vidence of GOD in favour of its <HI>fir&s;t &s;ettlers</HI> when few in number and weak in &s;trength, demands our &s;erious attention, and the approbation of all who &s;ay in their hearts <HI>let the Lord be magnified.</HI></P>
<P>Many were the afflictions, and as many the favourable interpo&s;itions of Providence, expe|rienced by our <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> from the time of their fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays to quit their native land, till they ar|rived and &s;ettled in this. A proper recollection of the&s;e things, hath a happy tendency to impre&s;s our minds with a becoming Sen&s;e of GOD and the goodne&s;s of Providence to his &s;uffering people.</P>
<P>To &s;tir up our minds by way of remembrance, a great many things have been well &s;aid upon the occa&s;ion by my worthy Brethren who have gone before me.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="015256_0005_0F988329BA222420">The mo&s;t noted <HI>hi&s;torical facts,</HI> relative to the coming over of our fore-fathers&punc; have been named in the fir&s;t public Sermon on this occa&s;ion, from <HI>P&s;alm</HI> lxxviii.5, 6, 7. Al&s;o their &s;mallne&s;s in num|bers, &s;trength and wealth, and the duty of not de&s;pi&s;ing the day of &s;mall things, in another Ser|mon, from <HI>Zech.</HI> iv.10. The general nature of that freedom, civil and religious, to which we have all an equal right&mdash;the embarra&s;&s;ments that tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion throw in the way of the exerci&s;e of &s;uch freedom, and the duty of a peo|ple to re-a&s;&s;ume it, if po&s;&s;ible, when it is wre&s;ted from them, in another, from <HI>Gen.</HI> i.31, and <HI>P&s;.</HI> cxix.134. And la&s;tly, a repre&s;entation of the heroic faith of Abraham exemplified, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by our pious fore-fathers, in a fourth Sermon, from <HI>Heb.</HI> xi.8. The&s;e things have been &s;et before you already; and <HI>what &s;hall we &s;ay more?</HI></P>
<P>Time would fail us, to give you a full narrative of the vici&s;&s;itudes that they and theirs pa&s;&s;ed thro'&mdash;the &s;uffering they underwent&mdash;the chri&s;|tian courage, patience, faith and fortitude they maintained, and their final &s;ucce&s;s, growth and increa&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the trials and per&s;ecu|tions that befell them during the de&s;potic reigns of the four <HI>Kings</HI> of the <HI>Stuart Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Methinks it may be &s;aid of the&s;e fir&s;t emigrants and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, as was &s;aid of the I&s;raelites in the text, <HI>the more they</HI> (their adver&s;aries) <HI>af|flicted them, the more they</HI> (the &s;ufferers) <HI>multi|plied and grew</HI>&mdash;grew in the chri&s;tian graces and virtues; and at length, in numbers, wealth and &s;trength, &s;o that finally (the oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures
<PB N="7" REF="015256_0006_0F98832A7ACC0080">
taken again&s;t them notwith&s;tanding) they ro&s;e from &s;mall beginnings to become a numerous and flouri&s;hing people.</P>
<P>It is a truth worthy our notice, and let it be the general ob&s;ervation from the text, that, <HI>When</HI> GOD <HI>de&s;igns the growth and increa&s;e of a people, even the afflictions they meet with &s;hall be over-ruled to promote the &s;ame.</HI> So it hath been, and &s;o it will be; and nothing under heaven &s;hall be able to prevent it.</P>
<P>If the Lord is determined that a people &s;hall grow and multiply, either in the natural, civil, or religious way; no tribulation, or per&s;ecution, or any kind of affliction from their adver&s;aries &s;hall di&s;appoint him of his purpo&s;e. <HI>Surely there is no enchantment again&s;t Jacob, neither is there any divination again&s;t I&s;rael.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numbers xxiii.231.</NOTE></P>
<P>We are &s;en&s;ible that <HI>affliction</HI> is a general term that &s;ignifieth trouble, di&s;tre&s;s and adver&s;ity, ari&s;|ing either from cruel oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecution, or from wi&s;e correction and ju&s;t puni&s;hment; for tho' there is a wide difference between oppre&s;&s;ion, and proper correction, as the one is always wrong, and the other always right, yet they are both afflictive to the party oppre&s;&s;ed, or corrected.</P>
<P>The natural <HI>tendency</HI> of affliction, is, to wa&s;te, dimini&s;h and de&s;troy the afflicted; and this will be the i&s;&s;ue, in ca&s;e the affliction ri&s;es and conti|nues, unle&s;s the providence of GOD prevents it. This might ea&s;ily be demonstrated by a cour&s;e of plain rea&s;oning; but this method to prove the de|&s;tructive
<PB N="8" REF="015256_0007_0F98832B3A09C9C0">
tendency of affliction is needle&s;s, becau&s;e we have &s;triking in&s;tances of the fact in the conti|nual decrea&s;e of the abu&s;ed <HI>Africans</HI> in the We&s;t-India I&s;lands. Their afflictions and bondage are &s;o many and great, that in&s;tead of multiplying and growing, it is quite the rever&s;e, they dimini&s;h and peri&s;h &s;o fa&s;t under the cruel hand of oppre&s;&s;ion, that the proprietors or planters are obliged to &s;end for new recruits of many thou&s;ands every few years to keep their numbers good and their lucrative bu&s;ine&s;s going on. The inhumanity, cruelty and wickedne&s;s of the practice is a great deal blacker than the mi&s;erable creatures them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But however true it is, that affliction is ruinous in its natural tendency, yet thro' the merciful in|terpo&s;ition of GOD it takes a <HI>new direction,</HI> and, in regard to its effects, it becomes good and &s;alu|tary both to individuals and communities. Under the influence of GOD, the fruit of affliction is the taking away of &s;in, the reformation of manners, and the enlargement and &s;alvation of a people. This may be called the <HI>providential tendency</HI> of affliction, and this is the way that good is brought out of evil.</P>
<P>Whenever we are afflicted, either by the hand of GOD or man, it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed that we have offended and merit the rod. This is always true when the Almighty afflicts us, and, with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety, we may adopt the confe&s;&s;ion of Nehemiah, <HI>thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly.</HI> But this is not always true when we are afflicted by the hands of men; i. e. we do not always de&s;erve it of them. They &s;ometimes,
<PB N="9" REF="015256_0008_0F98832BFA1F5D30" MS="y">
either through ignorance or ill will, make an un|ju&s;t judgment, and a wrong application; and hence they puni&s;h the innocent, or cau&s;e the guilty to be puni&s;hed beyond the demerit of his offence. In both ca&s;es (unavoidable ignorance excepted) they are chargeable with inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We know that <HI>ignorance,</HI> be it moral or politi|cal, is not the proper &s;ubject of penalty; and that he who offends only in one degree is not the pro|per &s;ubject of ten, or of two degrees of puni&s;h|ment. Hence, they who knowingly mini&s;ter a &s;tripe where none is due, or two &s;tripes where but one is due (be they Parents, Ma&s;ters or Magi&s;trates that do it, either again&s;t an individual or again&s;t a community) they act the part of oppre&s;&s;ors and tyrants, and may ju&s;tly expect to hear from the Almighty that &s;evere reprimand, <HI>what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah iii.15.</NOTE></P>
<P>When a <HI>Child,</HI> that is grown to the &s;tate of manhood and &s;elf-government, and is &s;et at liberty by the laws of GOD and man, to regulate and take care of him&s;elf, hath, by his indu&s;try, pro|vided for his own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, how ba&s;e and wicked is it for his <HI>Parents</HI> to &s;eize the fruit of his labor&mdash;to demand the &s;urrender of his per&s;on and property to their arbitrary di&s;po&s;al, and make his refu&s;al &s;uch a capital offence as to pur&s;ue him with vengeance? A proceeding &s;imilar to this, either in a family or civil &s;tate, is nothing &s;hort of high-handed oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty; and for parents or magi&s;trates to plead any human law
<PB N="10" REF="015256_0009_0F98832CBADA3538">
what&s;oever in vindication of &s;uch practice, does no more exculpate them than it did the mur|derous witne&s;&s;es again&s;t our Saviour to plead and &s;ay, <HI>we have a law, and by our law he ought to die.</HI>*</P>
<P>Any law or in&s;titution contrary to the law of GOD, or again&s;t the good of the people, is a law that e&s;tabli&s;heth iniquity: and the execution of it produceth an affliction &s;o painful and grievous that it cannot and ought not to be borne without re&s;i&s;tance, or making &s;ome e&s;&s;ay for deliverance, agreeably to the principle of &s;elf-defence.</P>
<P>We further add,</P>
<P>Afflictions of any kind that are pungent, do lay the afflicted under nece&s;&s;ity of &s;truggling, in order to extricate them&s;elves. If it be a profli|gate &s;inner, who&s;e con&s;cience is afflicted with a &s;en&s;e of his &s;in, guilt, and danger of the wrath to come, his enquiry will be, <HI>what &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> If a chri&s;tian or a chri&s;tian church be afflicted with a &s;en&s;e of apo&s;tacy and of the divine correction, their concern and exertion will be to repent, reform, and be re&s;tored to the peace and love of GOD. If it be a civil community, afflicted with public oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash;with a &s;en&s;e of the lo&s;s, or the danger of lo&s;ing their natural or &s;tipulated rights, it pre&s;ently moves them to &s;eek, devi&s;e and and pro&s;ecute ways and means of freedom and &s;afety; a kind of nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon them &s;o to do. In this ca&s;e the old pro|verb is verified, <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity is the mother of inven|tion</HI>; &s;he is a fruitful mother, and the nece&s;&s;itous
<PB N="11" REF="015256_0010_0F98832D7A1E43F0">
and afflicted find them&s;elves pre&s;s'd and con&s;train|ed to exert their wi&s;dom, genius, and all their inventive powers for their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Now, when the providence of GOD directs and a&s;&s;i&s;ts the awakened genius of &s;uch an afflicted people, they are often led to &s;earch out and make di&s;covery of tho&s;e means and ways of defence and relief, which otherwi&s;e they neither would have attempted, or even thought of; however, the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e efforts hath often been the deli|verance and enlargement of a people. And this is what we ob&s;erve, that, the &s;ame afflictions and oppre&s;&s;ions which naturally tend to ruin, lay wa&s;te and de&s;troy a body of people, are neverthele&s;s, under GOD's directing influence, the means and occa&s;ion of their ri&s;ing to a free and flouri&s;hing &s;tate.</P>
<P>Civil communities, as well as chri&s;tians, and chri&s;tian churches, have experienced the truth of what is here a&s;&s;erted, and to confirm the &s;ame, appeals may be made to &s;acred and prophane hi&s;tory, from both of which the point will be lilucidated.</P>
<P>The growth and increa&s;e of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> un|der the afflictions, &s;lavery and bondage of <HI>Egypt,</HI> is to the purpo&s;e. Their adver&s;aries (deaf to the demand of GOD, <HI>let my people go that they may &s;erve me;</HI> and deaf to the cries and petitions of the afflicted) racked their invention to find out ways and means to wa&s;te, di&s;hearten and de&s;troy them. To this end &s;pake the Egyptian Monarch to his noble Lords, &s;aying, <HI>come on, let us deal wi&s;ely

with them, le&s;t they multiply&mdash;and &s;ight again&s;t us, and get them up out of the land.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exodus i.10.</NOTE> This wi&s;e con|&s;ultation i&s;&s;ued in many &s;evere projects, &s;uch as, appointing over them ta&s;k-ma&s;ters&mdash;making them &s;erve with rigour&mdash;drawing the chains of their bondage tighter&mdash;taking away their &s;traw, yet demanding the full tale of brick, and beating them in ca&s;e of default; nor was this all, two edicts of death were made out and &s;ent to the midwives to put in execution, one was, to kill the male children with their own hands as &s;oon as they were born, the other, to ca&s;t them into the river; this was a blow at the root. However, the Midwives <HI>feared GOD</HI>&mdash;di&s;obeyed the king, and &s;aved the children alive: nor was this di&s;o|bedience cen&s;ured of GOD as rebellion, but their conduct was &s;o highly approved of him, that it is &s;aid, <HI>he made them hou&s;es.</HI> i. e. gave them flou|ri&s;hing families. It may al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that as the time of their exodus drew nearer, the weight and angui&s;h of their afflictions increa&s;ed, &s;o that <HI>their lives were made bitter with hard bondage.</HI> But the providence of GOD being favourable to|ward them, they multiplied and grew (notwith|&s;tanding the oppre&s;&s;ions and mi&s;eries they were under, during the latter part of their re&s;idence in Egypt) &s;o that in about 220 years, there &s;prang, from 70 &s;ouls, the va&s;t number of 600,000 fight|ing men, which, according to common calculation, &s;uppo&s;eth the whole number of &s;ouls that left Egypt, not le&s;s than three millions.</P>

<P>Rather let us imitate <HI>their</HI> noble example in times of adver&s;ity; and, like them, the more we are afflicted by our adver&s;aries or cha&s;tened by the hand of Providence, the more let us pray, and humble our&s;elves before GOD, and confe&s;s our &s;ins, and lament the wickedne&s;s of the times, and implore <HI>the mercy of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and reform our manners, and improve the means and advantages God hath put into our hands, in the be&s;t manner we po&s;&s;ibly can, for the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls, and our bodies, our lives, liberties, pro|perty

and country. The&s;e are objects worthy our attention; and, as they are all a&s;&s;aulted, either by our temporal or &s;piritual enemies, we are in duty bound to apply our&s;elves, with all the &s;kill and re&s;olution we have, to defend and &s;ave them.

<P>Let us upon this day, in a grateful, decent, and virtuous manner, <HI>recognize the goodne&s;s of GOD to our fore-fathers through all their trials and af|flictions,</HI> and take courage therefrom, to hope in the power and mercy of the &s;ame GOD, who&s;e <HI>hand is not &s;hortned that it cannot &s;ave.</HI> Let us not enquire, as mi&s;ers do, who will &s;hew us earthly good, or, how &s;hall we make the greate&s;t and be&s;t worldly advantage by the mi&s;eries and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the pre&s;ent times? But, how &s;hall we do mo&s;t for the honour of the glorious GOD&mdash;the &s;alvation of our country, and the good of our fellow-men? To promote the&s;e great and worthy ends, let us chearfully and religiou&s;ly devote our abilities, for|tunes and lives, and be <HI>followers of them</HI> (our pious fore-fathers and other good chri&s;tians) <HI>who thro' faith and patience, and much tribulation, have entered into the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
