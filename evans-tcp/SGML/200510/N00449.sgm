</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THe Subject which I am at present to handle is the sin of Formality in Gods Worship, which is the sin con|demned in the Text, as none of the least of those many and very great controversies, that the Lord hath had all along with his professing people, and at this day has par|ticularly with our selves.</P>
<P>Take a brief explication of the Terms.</P>
<P><HI>Ephraim</HI> was the Second Son of <HI>Joseph</HI> born in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and that name given him in Re|membrance of Gods making him fruitful in the land of his <HI>affliction, Gen</HI> 41.52. unto him <HI>Jacob,</HI> in his Blessing, gave the Pre|ference to his Elder Brother, <HI>Gen.</HI> 48.20. The name is sometimes used for the whole
<PB N="2" REF="000571_0002_0FA7118134052380">
Tribe that lineally descended from him, and here for the Ten Tribes, of whom he was the Head or Chief, and is the same with.</P>
<P><HI>[The House of Israel.] Israel</HI> signifies a pre|vailer with God, and was the new Name which God gave to <HI>Jacob</HI> in memory of his Victorious combate at <HI>Peniel, Gen.</HI> 32.28. And all his posterity, the whole visible Church, bare that Name of <HI>Israel,</HI> until after the separation of the Ten Tribes from the two, when the Name of <HI>Israel</HI> was frequently given to the <HI>Ten,</HI> and the Name of <HI>Juda</HI> unto the <HI>two,</HI> so that <HI>Ephra|im</HI> and <HI>Israel</HI> in the Text are <HI>homonymous</HI> Terms, or intend the same people.</P>
<P>[<HI>Compasseth me.</HI>] Compassing is some|times used for Worship, and in that sense it is to be taken here. Thus <HI>Psal.</HI> 26.6. <HI>Compassing Gods Altar,</HI> intends Worship|ping of God, offering up Sacrifice on his Altar, which was one principal part of Wor|ship. In the same sense is the phrase used <HI>Psal.</HI> 7.7.</P>
<P>Christ hath promised that where his peo|ple <HI>meet together in his Name,</HI> (as all that are regularly Assembled for any part of In|stituted Worship do) <HI>he will be in the midst of them, Mat.</HI> 18.20. and if he be in the midst of us, we are then compassing him about.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hebrew</HI> word in the Text is also sometimes used for Beleaguering or Besieg|ing
<PB N="3" REF="000571_0002_0FA7118134052380">
a Town or City in an hostile way, and truly God accounts such hypocritical wor|ship little better than waging War against himself, &amp; such <HI>Compassers</HI> he looks at as his Besiegers, and they will sooner or later be dealt with as such&punc;</P>
<P>Some Expositors attribute it to the Pro|phet, as if he were beset with their Lies and scandalous Reports, to the prejudice of his Ministry, which is one of Satans strata|gems to prevent the Success of the Gospel, by reproaching them that dispense it. Thus they served <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> chap. 20.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">0. &amp; 18.18. and thus they lay snares for him that reproves in the Gate, <HI>Isa.</HI> 29.21. When Gods Messengers are reproving sin, they may look for such Treats, (though I would beg of this Auditory, that they would&punc; be more kind to us, and to themselves too, while we are according to our Commission, <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.1. shewing God's People their sin) It's a good note of one upon the place. <HI>A Faithful Minister is the Genter in which all the lives of Lies and Slan|ders meet.</HI> An ill case, if they be silent God is displeased, if they speak men are angry.</P>
<P>But I rather take it in the fore-going sense, as referring to God in his Worship.</P>
<P>[<HI>With Lies and Deceit</HI>] These Terms also mean the same thing, unless you will say the latter is Exegetical, and shews what was their aim and design in lying, <HI>viz.</HI> to
<PB N="4" REF="000571_0003_0FA71181EDDD4988">
God, they pretended to great devotion in keeping up the external form of Worship, without being sincere and real therein, and that was their lying, whereby they thought (tho' it was wretched Atheism so to think) to put God off, to deceive and put a cheat upon him, as if the Omniscient God could be imposed upon.</P>
<P>But this will be more fully opened in Explaining the Doctrine.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE.</P>
<P>Formality in God's Worship is accounted by him as Lying and Deceiving, and so is a very provoking sin. Formal Worshippers are lookt at by God as lyars and deceivers, and thereby exposed to his sorest anger.</P>
<P>There are three sorts of False and De|ceitful Worship, which God is Displeased with.</P>
<P N="1">1. When men Worship any other Person or thing than the one onely, living and true God, when they have and serve any other God before or besides the True God; and this is gross Idolatry and a breach of the first Commandment.</P>
<P N="2">2. When they Worship the true God but with False Worship, such as never <HI>came</HI> into his mind, but is the meer product of their own Invention, which yet they ob|serve
<PB N="5" REF="000571_0003_0FA71181EDDD4988">
in stead of, or mix or joyn with his Institutions. This is a Breach of the Se|cond Commandment, and very offensive to a Jealous God.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the object of the Worship is right, and the Worship it self is for the matter, or as to the externals thereof true, but the miscarriage of it lies in the man|ner of doing it, in that it is done with a Dissembling Heart, or in a cold formal manner. And this sin is forbidden in the third Commandment, which directs about the right manner of performing true Wor|ship (both natural and Instituted) to the true God.</P>
<P>The two latter may be intended here, and chiefly the third, or a mixture of them both (for the Heart cannot be right where the Worship is wrong) yea in a sense all three of them; For they had the Calves at <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Bethel,</HI> at best a false Medium, nor could they any more excuse themselves from the missing it in the object of worship too, than their Fathers, who tho' they proclaimed a Feast to <HI>Jehovah</HI> before the Golden Calf, yet might be said to have chosen new Gods (as <HI>Judg.</HI> 5.8.) and to Sacrifice to Devils and not to God, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.17 And be sure all this while their Heart was not right with God.</P>
<P>But I shall confine my Discourse unto such as are Professors of the true God,
<PB N="6" REF="000571_0004_0FA71182C1956D10">
who have also the right-way of Instituted Worship, but through the falseness of their hearts do but lye to him in all they per|form; a sin commonly practised in our Days by Professors of Religion.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is this Formal Worship, which is called Lying and Deceit?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It's worth our inquiring into, because called by very hard names, very much com|plained of in Scripture, and there is abun|dance of it among Gods visible people, yea too much among those that may have the Root of the matter in them, and also be|cause it's very provoking to God, and mis|chievous to them that use it.</P>
<P>Now I call that Formal Worship, which is opposed to that which is in reality. <HI>Paul</HI> opposes a <HI>Form of Godliness to the power of it,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.5. Such Pretenders make Pe|rilous Times. He intends such Persons as used an appearance without any reality, a shew without any substance. They made a profession of Godliness, and used much Pre|tensive Devotion in Worship, but there was nothing in it, save an appearance and shadow only, <HI>Vox preterea nihil,</HI> an empty Form, no powerful sincerity in their heart, nor good fruit in their life. And this Vi|zard men put on to deceive, that they may walk <HI>incognito</HI> in the World.</P>
<P>Formal Worship is Hypocritical Wor|ship, like a painted Tomb without, but
<PB N="7" REF="000571_0004_0FA71182C1956D10">
Corruption &amp; Rottenness within, Fire with|out and Frost within, A flame in the mouth but Ice in the Heart: A perfect piece of Pageantry, a Play, where he that is in shew a <HI>King,</HI> is in Reallity a <HI>Beg|gar.</HI></P>
<P>Such <HI>lying</HI> Worship is thus Described by Christ Mat. 15:8, 9. <HI>Drawing near to God with the Lips,</HI> when the Heart is far from him, near in look and gestures, but far in heart and spirit, this is the spirit of an Hypocrite. When out of any low, base, inferiour end, men are drawn or driven to those duties which indeed they have no Heart to, this the Lord ac|counts lying in his Worship. And the more external Preparations, the more Cost and Grandeur there is in it, the bigger the lye.</P>
<P>Christ reduceth all our Obedience, whe|ther in point of Worship or otherwise, unto that one word <HI>Love,</HI> now if not <HI>lov|ing</HI> Worship, its <HI>lying</HI> Worship; there is an Idol in the Heart, which has their Love, while God has their Lips only, they pretend Devotion to God, but the Idol in the Heart has the Heart all the while.</P>
<P>When the Heart and Body do not go together in the Service of God, the Body shews much love, but the Heart is otherwise imployed. Ezek. 33:31.</P>
<P>This <HI>lying</HI> worship is opposed to wor|shipping
<PB N="8" REF="000571_0005_0FA71185167B6EA0">
God in <HI>Spirit and Truth,</HI> John 4.24. <HI>Paul</HI> served God with his spirit, Rom. 1.9. But their Spirits, Soul and Hearts are not concerned or engaged, and so there is no <HI>Truth</HI> in their services, be|cause no <HI>Spirit</HI> in them, they are not spiritual and so cannot be true, for it is <HI>Truth in the inward parts that God re|quires, Psal</HI> 51, 6. <HI>Ephraim</HI> was called <HI>a silly Dove without an Heart. Hos.</HI> 7, 11. And that is a silly, sorry Sacrifice that has no heart in it, nor can it be acceptable to God, <HI>Who chiefly minds the Heart, Jer.</HI> 30.21.22.</P>
<P>And as the heart is to go with it, so the Conversation is to be consonant there|to. Want of either makes the worship a <HI>lye. As a man thinks in his heart so is he, Prov.</HI> 23.7. But that is known to God on|ly and himself. But when the Conversa|tion contradicts the Devotion his deceit|fulness is <HI>Obvious to men also Tit.</HI> 1.16. and there Christ gives this Direction for the <HI>knowing of men by their fruits, Mat.</HI> 7.16. And if the Heart be false the Conversa|tion will not be right, for the Heart go|verns the Conversation. If the Heart go not with the tongue, the <HI>Walk</HI> will to the Prudent observer (at least often) give the Tongue the lye, but if heart and tongue joyn, the Conversation among men will evidence <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the sincerity toward God.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000571_0005_0FA71185167B6EA0">Now such Worship is called

<P>Verbal lying when he speaks not the Truth <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">n his Heart, <HI>Psal.</HI> 15, 2. Affirm|ing that to be Truth which he knows to be untruth, or doth not know to be Truth, or denying that to be Truth, which he knows, at least thinks to be Truth, or knows not but that it may be Truth.</P>
<P>Practical Lying is when a man pre|tends and professes what he neither intends nor performs, when his works deny what his words Profess, this is practical lying, he <HI>lies</HI> in his way, though he speaks right in his words, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. 1.6. He assumes the Name of Religion, but he practically de|nies the thing, which consists not in words, but in Power, in Love, in Righteousness, Holiness&punc; Self-denial, Mortification, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to which he is a stranger: And this is the <HI>Lying</HI> which the Lord blames them for here and threatens else where, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.10.&mdash; 16. <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.1-7. with <HI>Psal.</HI> 50.7.22.</P>
<P N="2">2. It's called <HI>Deceit</HI> also, <HI>They compass me with Deceit</HI>: Thus Mal. 1.14. <HI>He that has a Male in his Flock, and offers a corrupt thing to the Lord,</HI> is called a Deceiver, and such an oblation is a piece of meer deceit.</P>
<P>A Deceiver is a sly, subtil, under-hand
<PB N="10" REF="000571_0006_0FA7118916B45508">
Dealer, one that plays <HI>Leger-de-main,</HI> that cogs and cheats, and designs to put a <HI>sham</HI> upon another, and this is the aim and spi|rit of a Formatist in Gods Worship; he contrives to put a cheat upon God, <HI>indeed to mock him,</HI> Gal. 6 7. And such a Wor|shipper is called a Deceiver.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because he defrauds the glorious God of his just due, and of the true Homage and Service which belongs to him from his Creatures. It's true, God cannot proper|ly be deceived, but he offers at it, does what he may towards it, and like a foolish, ignorant Atheist, imagines he may do it; thinks God will not see when he turns him off with a bad Sacrifice for a good one&punc; a <HI>corrupt and lame one for a sound one,</HI> Job 22.12&punc; 14. Thus he robs God of his <HI>Right,</HI> sends away the Heart a|bout other business, and complements God with a little Bodily Exercise, or Tongue-Devotion. The worm of his Lust doth eat the Kernel, and then with some seem|ing solemnity he makes the Heart-search|ing and Heart-demanding God a <HI>Present</HI> of the empty shell. A very shameful and af|fronting <HI>Cheat.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It may be called a piece of Deceit, because it does really deceive others: men that can only judge by the outward appear|ance, are utterl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> deceived by him. <HI>Sa|muel</HI> was deceived by <HI>Eliahs</HI> look, and <HI>Phi|lip</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="000571_0006_0FA7118916B45508">
by <HI>Simon Magus</HI>'s Profession. <HI>Come see <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> for the Lord</HI> was enough to have Blinded a <HI>Jonadab,</HI> save that the loud Trumpeting his own commendation was too much like an Hypocrite. Oh, thinks a good and charitable Christian, this is cer|tainly an Excellent Man, see his Parts, Zeal, Affection, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and his aim being to seem Religious before men, he puts him|self in his finest dress when he appears up|on the Stage in open view, turns the best side outward when he has a great many Spectators; while a sincere Soul whose business is to approve himself to God, is most engaged and enlarged in his Closet, where none but he that <HI>sees in Secret</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> observe him.</P>
<P N="3">3. But finally he is called a <HI>Deceiver,</HI> be|cause he doth most miserably and fatally <HI>deceive</HI> himself, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.22, 26. He puts a Paralogism or Fallacy upon himself, argues falsly, and concludes fallaciously concerning himself. And it's a proper punishment for him that thinks to deceive in his perfor|mance, to find himself deceived in his expe|cted acceptance. As <HI>Jacob</HI> feared lest his Father <HI>might,</HI> this <HI>Deceiver</HI> shall find that the All-seeing God most certainly <HI>will</HI> find out the <HI>Deceit,</HI> and reward him with a <HI>Curse</HI> instead of a <HI>Blessing,</HI> Gen. 27.12. Such persons may sport themselves with their own <HI>Deceivings</HI> for a time, 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.

<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">3. but the <HI>Deceiver</HI> shall be deceived at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">st. And he is the worst <HI>Deceiver</HI> that deceives himself.</P>
<P>For a further discovery of this sin of <HI>Lying</HI> and <HI>Deceit</HI> in Gods Worship, let us take notice of some of the <HI>Deceits</HI> used in Prayer, Hearing, Receiving the Sacrament, and Sanctifying the Sabbath; and our par|ticularizing here, will offer much matter of Conviction as we go along.</P>
<P N="1">1. Of Compassing God about with <HI>Lies</HI> and <HI>Deceit</HI> in Prayer.</P>
<P>Prayer is no small part of Instituted Worship, and to be made use of with eve|ry part of Worship. And doubtless Gods own Children have need to pray with <HI>Da|vid, That God would remove from them the way of</HI> Lying even when they are Praying, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.29.</P>
<P>In solitary prayer when they enter into their Closets and shut their doors, they are more happy than the most and best of Christians always are if they can shut out all vain and impertinent thoughts from coming in. All such (and much more wicked, blasphemous and unbelieving) thoughts are <HI>faults,</HI> and if allowed are <HI>lies</HI>; though they are not wickednesses, they are infirmities, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">nd if not watcht against and mourned over, will be charged on us as <HI>Lies</HI> and <HI>Deceit.</HI></P>
<P>In our ordinary social prayers, how hard
<PB N="13" REF="000571_0007_0FA7118A43D36690">
to keep our heart engaged in every word of Petition, Confession or Thanksgiving uttered by him that is our mouth unto God! vagaries are a sort of <HI>Lies,</HI> and wandering or diverting is <HI>De|ceiving.</HI></P>
<P>In extraordinary Prayers on Fasting and Humiliation Days there is a great deal of <HI>deceit</HI> used. Especially when men fast for <HI>strife and debate, Isa.</HI> 58.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>rend their Garments but not their hearts,</HI> water their their eyes, but do not <HI>afflict their Souls,</HI> o|pen their mouths, but keep their hearts shut, their heads hang down for a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> like a <HI>Bullrush,</HI> (though many arrive not to that, and so their <HI>lying</HI> is the more open and obvious, and their sin goes before-hand unto Judgment.) But they have no Sacri|nce of a broken heart and contrite spirit to present the Lord withal. What is this but <HI>dissembling</HI> and <HI>lying,</HI> while they pre|tend performance of the Duties of such a Solemnity, and yet neglect the principal thing required? If there be not (on such days especially) in their Addresses to God, hearty confessions of sin, deep Humiliation under it, and Soul affliction for it, with serious resolution to turn from it; all that is done without this, is nothing but <HI>lying</HI> and <HI>deceiving,</HI> and the greater the expence in the external part of the duty, the great|er the <HI>deceit</HI> if not rightly performed.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="000571_0008_0FA7118AF86729C8">To instance in the several parts of pray|er.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is Confession, and that either of Gods Glory, or our sin and vileness.</P>
<P>If we make Confession of Gods Glory and Majesty, and yet do not really and practically believe what we say; We call him Father, but do not honour him; Ma|ster, but do not fear him; Lord, but do not obey him; or Shepherd; but do not hear <HI>his voice and follow him</HI>; what do we less than <HI>mock</HI> and <HI>lye</HI> to him?</P>
<P>We confess his Omniscience, but carry toward him in our hearts, as if he were far out of our sight, that though he plant|ed the ear, and formed the eye, could nei|ther hear nor see, <HI>but was like the deaf and blind Idol, Psal.</HI> 115. come with our hands full of sin, as if we thought he could not discern whether we did lift up <HI>holy hands</HI> or no. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.8.</P>
<P>We acknowledge his <HI>Power</HI> in words, but doubt of his Ability to save us, and engage not our hearts to <HI>take hold of his Strength and be at peace with him.</HI></P>
<P>We confess his <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and yet will instruct and limit the <HI>Holy One</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> and be our own carvers in point of the things we would have granted us.</P>
<P>We call him our <HI>Soveraign,</HI> but must have our own wills, and while we say, <HI>Thy Will be done,</HI> are very impatient if ours
<PB N="15" REF="000571_0008_0FA7118AF86729C8">
he not complied with.</P>
<P>We verbally own his <HI>Goodness,</HI> but we <HI>lye</HI> in our hearts if we do not close with him as Goodness it self, and make him the object of our highest love accordingly.</P>
<P>We own his <HI>Mercy,</HI> but do not <HI>confide</HI> and <HI>hope</HI> in it: Confess him to be <HI>Just,</HI> and yet pass not <HI>the time of our sojourning&punc; before him in fear.</HI> We say it's a <HI>fearful thing to fall into his hands,</HI> and yet by such kind of trifling in his Worship do most directly deliver our selves up into the Hands of his Jealousie and Justice.</P>
<P>We profess our love to him, but while our heart is not with him, we <HI>mock</HI> him and <HI>lye</HI> to him, as she told <HI>Sampson, Judg.</HI> 16.15.</P>
<P>Thus while we confess all Gods Glorious Attributes in prayer, but do not make him the object of our Faith, Love, Fear, De|light, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we do not <HI>lye</HI> to him.</P>
<P>Thus also in Confession of our own Sin and Vileness.</P>
<P>We often confess sin, but do not believe that we are such Sinners indeed as we say we are, nor are sensible what an evil and bitter thing sin is. We call our selves Sinners in the general, but when we come to particulars, are ready to extenuate and excuse if not to deny it.</P>
<P>Again, if we confess the sin that we have no mind to part with, and acknow|ledge
<PB N="16" REF="000571_0009_0FA7118BB0D747D8">
those Iniquities that we keep in our bosoms with complacence and delight, what is this but deceitful dealing with God? We seem very pathetically in words to confess our own wretchedness and un|worthiness, but God and our own Consci|ences know that we do but <HI>lye</HI> unto him, <HI>while not humbled to this day, Jer.</HI> 44.10. and are better opinionated of our selves than wee pretend to in our Confessions.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A second part of Prayer is Petition.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>there</HI> is also a great deal of <HI>lying</HI> and <HI>deceit.</HI> As for Instance.</P>
<P>When we ask outward things to spend them upon our Lusts &amp; not that we may sincerely use them for the Glory of God; this <HI>is asking amiss,</HI> Jam. 4.3. This is <HI>deceitful Praying,</HI> to ask his mercies that we may fight against him with his own weapons; what is it but <HI>Couzenage</HI> and <HI>Deceit</HI>? So when we ask Gifts only to make a fine shew among men, and get a Reputation for Re|ligion; which is finally to sacrifice Gods Gifts to our ambition and vain-glory.</P>
<P>Or when we ask spiritual Blessings which we are not really concerned to receive.</P>
<P><HI>Austin has such a passage in his Confessions, that he often asked that of God in Prayer, which he was in his heart afraid lest he should give.</HI> Many seem to beg hard for Grace, when God knows, they do not desire it; ask Knowledge, when they hate the Light,

<P>Of such kind of addressing God in a Time of Affliction, the Lord pronounces that it is but <HI>flattering</HI> and <HI>lying,</HI> and that because the <HI>Heart is not right with God,</HI> Psa. 78.34&mdash;37.</P>
<P>And so of our Thanksgiving, which is also a part of <HI>Prayer,</HI> when we say in words, <HI>Lord, we bless and praise thy Name,</HI> but our hearts are not fixed to that work, nor do we take due care to order our whole Conversa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ion so as may be most for his Service and Glory.

<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>By way of Application.</HEAD>
<P>First, I shall draw some Inferences from the Doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">1. If there be such a thing as <HI>Lying</HI> and <HI>Deceitful Dealing</HI> in Gods Wors<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ip.&mdash; Then we have the less cause to wonder that there is so much <HI>Lying</HI> and <HI>Deceit</HI> a|mong men in their converse with each o|ther. It's a very lying Age that we live in. Men lye one to another, in falsifying their words, breaking their promises, yea, and
<PB N="21" REF="000571_0011_0FA7118D372251A0">
more solemn Obligations. Men lye one of another by scandalous Reports which they raise and broach, very much to the detri|ment of their Neighbours, and reproach of Religion. Yea, there are that make it no small part of their business to invent &amp; frame <HI>Lies,</HI> and scatter them abroad to a|muse the World withal, and to draw forth mens sentiments, <HI>on</HI> which they make their Remarks, and <HI>of</HI> which they make matter of Accusation. There is also much De|ceiving and Over-reaching one another in Dealing, the weakest (though the honest|est) goes to the wall; I say there is much of this among men. Think it not strange, while there is so much dissembling with God himself, you may look to meet with the like among men. And it arises from the same principle, the <HI>Atheism</HI> that is in all Mankind, that which makes them dare to <HI>lie</HI> to God, will not let them stick at <HI>lying</HI> to men. Look for nothing but fal|shood and mischief from him that makes no Conscience of essaying to put his cheats upon the Great God. He that will adven|ture to <HI>lye</HI> to God directly, will not stick more remotely to <HI>lye</HI> to him, as all <HI>lying</HI> to men is, all sin being finally against God.</P>
<P N="2">2. See what little cause we have to boast of any merit in any of our Services; where there is so much deceit, there can be no Merit.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="000571_0012_0FA711907521B328"><HI>Outward</HI> Performances if they be only <HI>such,</HI> are meer <HI>lies,</HI> and therefore rather provocations unto God, than obligations upon him. Hence when they trusted to the Temple of the Lord, and to their Ser|vices and Sacrifices there, the Lord tells them <HI>they trusted in lying words,</HI> Jer. 7.4. 8</P>
<P>But suppose they be sincere performan|ces, worship done in spirit and truth, there will be no room for trusting in or boasting of them; for the sincerity of the heart is Grace, &amp; that Grace tho inherent, yet is in|fused Grace, &amp; the exercise of that sincerity in Worship is exciting Grace, &amp; <HI>all Grace</HI> takes away all occasion of boasting.</P>
<P>There are some actings of pride in the best, to their shame and confusion of face, when they reflect thereupon: but usually, or mostly they are false in their Worship that trust to it, and of them it may be said, <HI>they trust to a Refuge of Lies, and un|der falshood do they hide themselves,</HI> Isa 28.25. Because all their Worship is so. Were our Services never so good, yet if trusted in when we have done them, we make a <HI>lye,</HI> an Idol of them, and shall find them to be a <HI>lye</HI> to us; much more when there is so much <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> attending the best of our doings, and so much lameness, leanness, and deformity in the chiefest of our Sacri|fices.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence see also the reason why God
<PB N="23" REF="000571_0012_0FA711907521B328">
is angry oft times at the Prayers of his Peo|ple, <HI>viz.</HI> Because he hates <HI>lying,</HI> of which he finds so much in them. <HI>Psal.</HI> 80.4.

Those that are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>services</HI> to God, will be <HI>lying Services</HI> to us also, nothing will come of them but Provocation and Punish|ment.</P>
<P>We know that God <HI>heareth not Sinners,</HI> Joh. 9.31. <HI>Lyars</HI> and <HI>Decei<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ers</HI> as they <HI>shall not dwell with him,</HI> Psal. 101.7. so nei|ther shall their Services come before him with Acceptance.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ot none of us that are conscious to our selves of a great deal of that Guilt in our Services, quarrel with God&punc; and say, <HI>Where|fore have we fasted and thou seest not</HI>?

Conviction, and upon due, serious and strict Examination, Conviction will follow. Is there not too too much of this <HI>lying</HI> Worship to be found among us?</P>
<P>Here is a great deal of worship, and many Worshippers. And those Worshippers that seek God daily, and approach into his presence frequently, are either Rege|nerate or Unregenerate, (for we may not believe, that all outward Worshippers are inwardly sincere) Now as to the <HI>Vnrege|nerate,</HI> especially if they are <HI>so</HI> knowingly, and continue <HI>so</HI> contentedly, all their wor|ship is a meer <HI>lye,</HI> all their devotion is a meer <HI>cheat,</HI> and so an abomination unto God; they do nothing else but beleagure and beset him with <HI>lies,</HI> are always fighting God with their <HI>lies,</HI> and many, perhaps the Body of <HI>Israel</HI> whom the Lord thus treats in the Text, were such.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Regenerate,</HI> they are not whol|ly freed from this way of <HI>lying,</HI> there are some Remains of <HI>Guile</HI> and <HI>Hypocrisie,</HI> which like dead flies are dropping into, and corrupting the Oyntment, or Incense of their best Performances.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The greatness of the sin.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It is <HI>Lying.</HI> And <HI>I</HI> need say no more. It's a sin though so generally practised, yet every where spoken against. It is a sin which mans corrupt nature is dreadfully addicted to; <HI>they go astray from the Womb, speaking lies,</HI> Psal. 58.3. And yet it is a sin condemned by the light of nature, con|demned by the verdict of every mans Con|science that is not blinded or bribed, asleep or seared. Men hate to be imposed upon with <HI>lies,</HI> and will be more ready to for|give a very great fault than a little one, when aggravated with <HI>lying.</HI> It's reckon|ed among the seven <HI>Abominations that the Lord hates,</HI> Prov. 6. 16.&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">. yea and ac|counted big enough to make two of the seven (if not three of them) though in a different sense.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="27" REF="000571_0014_0FA7119402BFA4D0">2. But more than so, it's <HI>lying</HI> to God, and that sin cost <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira</HI> their lives, <HI>Act.</HI> 5&punc;4, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And it's no small wonder of Patience and Long-suffer|ing that the Lord makes no more such Ex|amples among the <HI>great</HI> Troops of <HI>lying Worshippers</HI> that compass him every day, especially considering what a jealous God he is in point of Worship. To have a Company of Hypocrites come before God from time to time, only to fill his ears with <HI>lies,</HI> must needs be highly provoking, and it is very strange that the Angel of the Lord is not sent forth to make them all dead Corpses; Spiritual Judgments are doubtless secretly inflicted upon them&punc; which are the more dreadful because the less observable.</P>
<P N="3">3. It's rank <HI>Atheism,</HI> nor could men per|sist in such a course if they did realize the Being of God, or had not in their own imaginations framed to themselves a God like themselves. According to our senti|ments of God in our Hearts, so are our Carriages toward him in his Worship&punc; <HI>Deceitful Worshiping</HI> of him speaks us very much <HI>deceived</HI> in our Conceptions about him&punc;</P>
<P N="4">4. It is extream Insolence, daring bold|ness and presumption thus to impose upon God, to fight against him with our <HI>Lies,</HI> to cover his Face and ask who smote him.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="28" REF="000571_0015_0FA71195349B73F8">5. It is folly in the very Exaltation of it, such formal Services are Fools services. <HI>So|lomon</HI> calls rash, sudden, hasty, unprepared Sacrifices, the <HI>Sacrifices of Fools,</HI> Eccl. 5.1. I am sure, <HI>lying</HI> ones are such. It's folly for any thus to go about to impose on the Omniscient God, the height of folly once to dream of <HI>deceiving</HI> him, and worse than madness it self to do so by him, if they did not think they could deceive him.</P>
<P N="6">6. It disposes to a vain, unprofitable, A|theistical Conversation in our whole De|portment. As we are in our Worship, so we are in all our Walk. He that is Form|al and Atheistical there, will be so else|where.</P>

<P N="2">2. Nay more than so, such worship is not only lost to them, but very provoking to God; they cannot anger a jealous God more than by such <HI>Deceitful Services,</HI> his Anger smokes against <HI>lying Prayers,</HI> and the more of <HI>such</HI> prayers, the more Anger.</P>
<P>Hence in the first Chapter following on the Text it's said, <HI>They increased Lies and Desolations</HI>; what <HI>Lies</HI> did they increase? sure those <HI>lies</HI> in worship, for which they were blamed in my Text, they continued in their formal worship, multiplied their Sacrifices, and did the while but multiply <HI>lies</HI>; their <HI>new Sacrifices</HI> were but <HI>Compassing God about with new Lies</HI>; and what did they further increase thereby? why, they increas|ed <HI>Desolation.</HI> Increase of such <HI>Services</HI>&punc; was increase of <HI>Lies,</HI> increase of <HI>Lies</HI> was increase of <HI>Provocation</HI> unto God, and con|sequently of <HI>Desolation</HI> unto them.

For men to destroy themselves with a great deal of pains, labour, cost, splendor and grandeur is the worst kind of Destruct|ion.</P>
<P>Your <HI>Lying, Deceitful Services</HI> and Per|formances are both the pretences that you Compass God with, and the sparks that you Compass and comfort your selves with, but the Reward you will receive at the hands of God will be <HI>to lye down in sorrow,</HI> Isa. 50. <HI>ult.</HI> Such Worshippers of God are ne|vertheless counted forgotters of God, and their Doom is, <HI>To be Torn in Pieces without any to deliver them. Psal.</HI> 50&punc; 22.</P>
<P><HI>The Benefit of True and Sincere Worshipping of God.</HI></P>
<P>This is a large Theam, I shall but glance at a few hints. What is said of keep|ing Gods Commandments in General. <HI>Great is the Reward</HI> Psa. 19.11. is eminently true of the second Commandment, which gives
<PB N="34" REF="000571_0018_0FA711987899F5B0">
direction about <HI>Instituted Worship,</HI> see <HI>Exod.</HI> 20&punc; 6. And if you referr it to the Third Commandment, where the Lord threatens the Breaker of it, <HI>Not to hold him guileless,</HI> it is a <HI>Meiosis,</HI> and forest wrath is inten|ded therein, and on the other-hand all man|ner of blessings are designed for the keep|er of that Command. If the <HI>Deceiver</HI> in Wor+ship be Cursed Mala. 1, 11. Then the sin|cere Worshiper is blessed. Blessed with all spiritual blessings, God accepts his Services, remembers his Offerings, will give him pardon, peace, joy, the strength of his Right Hand <HI>&amp;c.</HI> see Psal. 20.1 &mdash;6. <HI>He shall see the Lords goings in his Sanctuary.</HI> And shall be able to attest to <HI>Davids</HI> Experience, (<HI>Psal.</HI> 84.10.) <HI>One day in Gods House is worth a Thousand.</HI></P>
<P>Blessed with all outward blessings al|so. Seeking the <HI>Kingdom of God first,</HI> (of which no small part lies in a right perfor|ming the worship of the Kingdom&punc;) has a promise of the Addition of <HI>all other things,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. 6.33. God deals with a professing peo|ple as they deal with him in his Worship. If we Compass him with hearty sincere ser|vice, he will Compass us with <HI>favour as with a Shield</HI> Psal. 1.12, Mercy shall Compass us, no good thing shall be wanting to us. While such kind of formal worshippers of whom we have been speaking, say as they feel, <HI>that it is in vain to serve God,</HI> we shall
<PB N="35" REF="000571_0018_0FA711987899F5B0">
speak as we find, <HI>That it is good for us to draw near unto God,</HI> Psal. 23.28.</P>

<HEAD>Directions for the Cure of this Malady.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Be sure we fix upon the <HI>right</HI> (and there is but one <HI>right) Object</HI> of Worship. <HI>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve, Mat.</HI> 4.10. The great God is the sole Object of Worship. Let us not make our <HI>Bellies</HI> our God, <HI>Gold</HI> our Hope, the <HI>World</HI> our portion; nor our own <HI>Righteousness&punc; Wisdom,</HI> or <HI>Strength</HI> our Idol; nor <HI>our selves</HI> our Saviours, <HI>Sacrifice not to our own Net, nor burn Incense to our own Drag.</HI> Hab. 1.16.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be well acquainted with the Person whom we Worship, and that will oblige us what we may to study a proportion be|tween our Worship, and the Object of our Worship.</P>
<P>The <HI>Knowledge</HI> of God will teach us <HI>that</HI> he is to be Worshipped, and also <HI>how</HI> he is to be Worshipped, will make us fear to neglect it, and assist us in the due perfor|mance of it.</P>
<P>To cure the <HI>Deceiver</HI> that had a <HI>Male</HI> in his flock, but offered a <HI>corrupt</HI> thing, the Lord gives him to understand, and will<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> him to consider that he was a <HI>Great King,</HI> and had a <HI>Dreadful Name,</HI> even the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> Mal. 1.14.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="000571_0019_0FA71199330399D0">His being a <HI>Spirit</HI> will tell us that he is to be <HI>Worshipped in Spirit and Truth,</HI> not after a <HI>carnal</HI> and <HI>lying</HI> manner.</P>
<P>Consider him as the first Being, &amp; chief|est Good, &amp; thence learn, that the first &amp; best of our <HI>Hearts, Abilities, Time, Spirits, Souls,</HI> are his due, and that <HI>lame, blind, heartless, useless Services</HI> are very much un|becoming him.</P>
<P>His <HI>Soveraignty</HI> as it commands Devoti|on, so it will guard us from snuffing at his Service, or slubbering over his Worship.</P>
<P>His <HI>Omnipresence</HI> will beget <HI>Reverence,</HI> and promote <HI>Sincerity.</HI> It's no great mat|ter how men carry it before an Idol that has no eyes, but <HI>Reason,</HI> much more <HI>Reli|gion</HI> will direct us to look to our selves, when we have such an eye upon us, and will be useful to prevent that commonness of Heart and Carriage so unsuitable for his Presence.</P>
<P>His <HI>Omniscience</HI> will assure us that he will not be <HI>shamm'd</HI> nor imposed upon, there's no <HI>mocking</HI> him with shadows or pretences; he is not to be treated after that manner. He will say to every Hypocrite, tho' under the greatest disguise, why seignest thou thy self to be another person, I have heavy Tidings for thee; and a Curse upon the <HI>Deceiver</HI> is heavy Tidings</P>
<P>His <HI>Omnipotence</HI> will represent him as a person that has in a readiness wherewith
<PB N="37" REF="000571_0019_0FA71199330399D0">
to avenge all Affronts, and to assist all the Humble Souls that desire to serve him bet|ter.</P>
<P>His <HI>Holiness</HI> tells us that we must lift up <HI>holy hands</HI> and <HI>hearts</HI> before him, and purge our selves in order to our being <HI>Vessels fit|ted for our Masters use.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Justice</HI> will caution us from taking his <HI>Name in vain,</HI> because he will not <HI>hold us Guiltless</HI>; and when we take up his Worship without spirit, heart, life, care, labour, seriousness, we take his <HI>Name in vain.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Bounty</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> will quicken us to serve him with <HI>Enlargedness</HI> of Heart, who hath such a <HI>liberal</HI> hand to <HI>reward</HI> all his Servants.</P>
<P>His <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Faithfulness</HI> as they will put us beyond dispute about the certainty of the <HI>Reward,</HI> if we serve him <HI>well,</HI> so of the <HI>Punishment,</HI> if <HI>trifling</HI> and <HI>slightly</HI> therein.</P>
<P>Thus right Conceptions of God will no|tably influence you into right Worship, &amp; a due performance of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Study well the <HI>right</HI> way in which God will be Worshipped, and his <HI>own</HI> way is the only <HI>right</HI> way. He hath plainly told us in his Word, <HI>how</HI> he will be Worship|ped; if we bring him any other Worship than that of his own prescribing, he will call it <HI>lying</HI> and <HI>deceit.</HI> Beware therefore
<PB N="38" REF="000571_0020_0FA7110CE0511A10">
that none spoil you through vain <HI>deceit</HI> af|ter the <HI>Traditions</HI> of <HI>men,</HI> Col. 2.8. A very good caution, for <HI>Traditions of men</HI> in the Worship of God, will spoil our Worship, and spoil us also, aand are <HI>rightly</HI> called <HI>deceitful</HI> and <HI>vain,</HI> because they take us off from the only true, acceptable and profi|table Service of God. Resolve upon it, either Bible-Worship or none at all, all other being <HI>as,</HI> yea <HI>worse than</HI> none. It's <HI>lying</HI> worship if not warranted by God's Word, whatever <HI>pretences</HI> it may make to <HI>Decency</HI> in it self, or <HI>Authority</HI> from men, Traditions from our Fore-fathers, or the Commands of the Church, God will say of it, <HI>Bring no more vain oblations, &amp; who has re|quired these things at your hands</HI>? Nor will God take it as an answer if we say that <HI>Ecclesiastical Authority</HI> enjoyned it, unless it agree with the <HI>Pattern</HI> in the <HI>Mount,</HI> and be prescribed by the <HI>Lord of the House.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Let us offer up all our worship by Christ, God in Christ is the object of Divine Worship. To goe to God in our Prayers or other Services, immediately, to God out of or without Christ is to <HI>lye</HI> in our <HI>services.</HI> That General Rule of <HI>Doing all in the Name of the Lord Jesus Col.</HI> 2.17. holds most strictly in point of worship. All our prayers are to be <HI>made in his Name, Joh.</HI> 14.41. And all our prais|es are <HI>to be Offered up by him, Heb.</HI> 13.15.
<PB N="39" REF="000571_0020_0FA7110CE0511A10">
Otherwise what-ever of <HI>Labour, Care, Zeal, Cost,</HI> may be put into our <HI>Obla|tions,</HI> if there be nothing of <HI>Christ</HI> in them they signify nothing at all with God; they are Lame, Blind, Lean and Dead Sacrifi|ces, and will be most displeasing in Gods most Pure Eies, and the savour of them very offensive to his Nostrils if not perfum|ed with the Incense of his Merits which he is Offering up <HI>with the prayers of the Saints.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. See that our Hearts be in the wor|ship, fervently and frequently make that necessary Prayer, Ps. 119.80. <HI>Let my Heart be sound in thy Statutes,</HI> especially sound in <HI>thy</HI> Statutes and <HI>my</HI> performances about <HI>Wor|ship,</HI> because God is eminently Jealous there. Daily make <HI>Davids</HI> prayer, <HI>That God will re|move from us the way of lying, Psal.</HI> 119.29. And that particularly when we draw near unto God in worship, that we may do it with a <HI>true Heart, Heb.</HI> 10.22. Ingage the Heart to go along with our Bodies and Tongues, when addressing the Heart-searching God, yea &amp; do not only carry our Hearts thither, but by an extraordinary care and watchfulness keep them there, that they may not give you the slip, and so render all your worship <HI>successless,</HI> be|cause <HI>heartless.</HI> Then only do you wor|ship God in Spirit and Truth when your Hearts are sincerely active in what you
<PB N="40" REF="000571_0021_0FA7110CF4803750">
do. Dare not <HI>offer</HI> unto God that which cost you nothing but a little Breath and Lip-labour, remember that your Heart gives value to your two Mites, the least piece of Hearty Service is in high esteem with God.</P>
<P N="6">6. Finally let our constant Walk be al|ways consonant to our Worship, our De|portment agreeable to our Devotions, our whole Conversations such as become such Worshippers. A loose Conversation gives the <HI>lye</HI> to a specious profession. If what be said in words is contradicted in works, God will call it <HI>lying</HI> and <HI>deceit, Tit.</HI> 1.16. To be zealous and warm in our <HI>Wor|ship</HI> but luke warm and carnal in our <HI>Walk</HI> is most absurd and Contradictory. Let us <HI>Live</HI> our <HI>Hearing, Praying, Sabbaths, Sacraments,</HI> &amp;c. and then we worship well, And if we do indeed worship well, our <HI>worship</HI> to God will observably Influence, all our <HI>converse</HI> with men. And Oh how amiable and pleasant is an Harmonious A|greement there! And how unseemly the contrary! That men walk no better be|fore and after worship, is an ill sign of their being <HI>insincere and false and deceitful in it.</HI></P>
<P>To Conclude,</P>
<P>Thus you have heard <HI>one</HI> more very common and provoking sin declaimed a|gainst. And note that when the Lord gave the Prophet <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.1. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> his Com|mission
<PB N="41" REF="000571_0021_0FA7110CF4803750">
<HI>To shew unto his people their Trans|gressions, And to the house of Jacob their sins,</HI> this was the first sin that he directed him to lift up his voice and sound his Trumpet against. There was much Worship, but little Holiness, many Sacrifices but no Righ|teousness, frequent <HI>Approaches</HI> to God, but little <HI>Walking</HI> with him. And it's e|vident that their design in these external performances was to conceal or get allow|ance for their wickedness, as appears by quarrelling God that he took no more no|tice of their <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">sting,</HI> nor gave them expect|ed Answers to their <HI>Prayers,</HI> though the Lord sufficiently stopt their mouth, by let|ting them know, that while they lived in such palpable neglect of the <HI>Second-Table-Duties,</HI> their pretended compliance with the <HI>First,</HI> could very little avail them. Of the like import is <HI>Psal.</HI> 50. and <HI>Isa.</HI> 1. in the latter of which he plainly tells them, <HI>That the multitude of their Sacrifices</HI> was to <HI>no purpose,</HI> they did but <HI>trouble</HI> him, and not <HI>profit</HI> themselves: &amp; God bids them <HI>give over, verse</HI> 13. Not that he did abate them these <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> or will abate us our <HI>Devo|tion</HI>; no, but <HI>bring no more vain Oblations</HI>; so does God say to us, <HI>bring no more lying Services,</HI> make no more <HI>deceitful Prayers</HI>; let me have no more of these <HI>formal, Hypo|critical</HI> Assemblings. Upon the penalty of lo|sing all our Prayers, (&amp; we had better lose
<PB N="42" REF="000571_0022_0FA7110DC1B7A2E0">
all the Comforts we have in the World, than lose our Prayers) Upon the penalty of having them turned into sin, (a dreadful imp<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="8 letters"> upon <HI>Jud<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> that monstrous <HI>Hy|pocrite,</HI> as appears by comparing <HI>Psal</HI> 109.7. with <HI>Act.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.20. and that which every such dissembling <HI>Worshipper</HI> may be afraid of.) Upon the penalty of losing all graci|ous converse with God, of blocking up the way to prevent any good coming at thee for ever, of having the <HI>Lord to kindle a fire in his Jealousie that shall burn to the lowest Hell,</HI> of his <HI>rending thee in pieces, &amp; there be none to deliver thee,</HI> I say upon all these pe|nalties, (and they are terrible ones) leave off, presently and utterly leave off All <HI>ly|ing</HI> &amp; <HI>dissembling</HI> with God in his Worship.</P>
<P>Do not cast off worship because it is so dangerous to intermeddle with, but engage in it <HI>sincerely, heartily, with Reverence &amp; godly fear,</HI> shun the <HI>lying</HI> &amp; <HI>deceit</HI> that too often <HI>does</HI> attend it, comply with the sincerity &amp; pain|fulness, care &amp; conscience that always <HI>should</HI> attend it. <HI>Sincerity</HI> will God approve of and countenance; <HI>Infirmity,</HI> especially when be|moaned &amp; resisted, he will forgive &amp; over|look, &amp; all the expence we are at in <HI>Worship|ping God in spirit &amp; truth,</HI> will be plentifully compensated by fulfilling that promise, <HI>Exo.</HI> 20.23. In all places where <HI>I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will Bless thee.</HI></P>
