<P>The&s;e &s;hall go away into Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Excellency of the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation is evidenced by nothing more, than tho&s;e Sanctions of Rewards and Puni&s;hments, which it offers to the Choice of all its Profe&s;&s;ors, in order to invite or compel them to be obedient to its Precepts. &mdash; For it promi&s;es no le&s;s than Eternal Happine&s;s to the Good, and de|nounces no &s;lighter a Puni&s;hment than Everla&s;ting Mi|&s;ery again&s;t the Wicked. On the one Hand, <HI>it is a Savour of Life unto Life,</HI> on the other, <HI>a Savour of Death unto Death.</HI> And tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> would imagine the bare mentioning of the former would be &s;ufficient to draw Men to their Duty, yet Mini&s;ters in all Ages have found it nece&s;&s;ary frequently to remind their Peo|ple of the latter, and to &s;et before them the Tenors of the LORD, as &s;o many powerful Di&s;&s;ua&s;ives from Sin.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="040229_0003_1015D51142C048E0">But whence is it that Men are &s;o di&s;ingenuous? &mdash;Why, the Rea&s;on &s;eems to be this.&mdash; The Promi&s;e of Eternal Happine&s;s on our Well-doing, is &s;o agreeable to the Inclinations and Wi&s;hes of Mankind, that all that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, univer&s;ally and willingly &s;ub&s;cribe to the Belief of it. But then there is &s;ome|thing &s;o &s;hocking in the Con&s;ideration of Eternal <HI>Tor|ments,</HI> and &s;eemingly &s;uch an infinite Di&s;proportion be|tween an endle&s;s Duration of Pain, and a &s;hort Life &s;pent in Plea&s;ure, that Men (&s;ome at lea&s;t of them) can &s;carcely be brought to confe&s;s it as an Article of their Faith, that an Eternity of Mi&s;ery awaits the Wicked in a future State.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore at this Time beg Leave, to in&s;i&s;t on the proof of this Part of one of the Articles of our Creed; and endeavour <HI>to make good</HI> what our ble&s;&s;ed LORD has here threatned in the Words of the Text, that <HI>The&s;e,</HI> that is, the <HI>Wicked, &s;hall go away into Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, without con&s;idering the Words as they &s;tand in Relation to the Context, I &s;hall re&s;olve all I have to &s;ay into this one general Propo&s;ition,&mdash;
<Q>That the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked here after are Eternal.</Q></P>
<P>But before I proceed to make good this, I mu&s;t in|form you that I take it for granted,</P>
<P>All here pre&s;ent &s;tedfa&s;tly believe,
<Q>They have &s;omething within them, which we call a Soul, and which is capable of &s;urviving the Di&s;&s;olution of the Body, and of being mi&s;erable or happy to all Eter|nity.</Q></P>
<P>I take it for granted farther,
<Q>That you believe a Divine Revelation; that tho&s;e Books, emphatically
<PB N="4" REF="040229_0004_1015D508C9E802C0">
called <HI>the Scriptures,</HI> were written by the In&s;pira|tion of GOD, and that the Things therein contain|ed, are founded upon Eternal Truth.</Q></P>
<P>I take it for granted la&s;tly,
<Q>That you believe, that the Son of GOD came down to die for Sinners; that there is but one Mediator between GOD and Man, even the Man CHRIST JESUS.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Things being granted (and they were nece&s;&s;a|ry to be premi&s;ed) proceed we now <HI>to make good</HI> the one general Propo&s;ition mentioned before, and a&s;&s;erted in the Text, that
<Q>The Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal.</Q>
&mdash; <HI>The&s;e,</HI> &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed LORD, <HI>&s;hall go away into Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Argument I &s;hall advance to prove that the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereafter are eternal (for I have taken it for granted, that you believe tho&s;e Books, emphatically called <HI>the Scriptures,</HI> were written by the In&s;piration of GOD, and that the Things con|tained therein are founded upon Eternal Truth) is, That the Word of GOD him&s;elf, a&s;&s;ures us, Line upon Line, that it will be &s;o.</P>
<P>To quote all the Texts that might be produced in Proof of this, would be endle&s;s.&mdash;Let it &s;uffice to in|&s;tance only in a few.&mdash;In the <HI>Old-Te&s;tament,</HI> in the Book of <HI>Daniel,</HI> Chap. xii. ver. 2. we are told, that <HI>Some &s;hall awake to Everla&s;ting Life, and others to E|verla&s;ting Contempt.</HI>&mdash;In the Book of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> it is &s;aid, that <HI>The Worm of tho&s;e that have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed GOD's Law, &s;hall not die, nor their Fire be quenched.</HI>&mdash;And in another Place, the Holy Prophet, &s;truck, no doubt, with A&s;toni&s;hment and Horror at the Pro&s;pect of the Continuance of the Torments of the Damned, breaks out into this moving Expo&s;tulation, <HI>Who can dwell with Everla&s;ting Burnings?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="040229_0005_1015D51396D9DE68">The <HI>New-Te&s;tament</HI> is &s;till fuller as to this Point, it being a Revelation which brought this and &s;uch-like Particulars to a clear Light.&mdash;The Apo&s;tle <HI>Jude</HI> tells us of the profane De&s;pi&s;ers of Dignities in his Days, that <HI>for them was re&s;erved the Blackne&s;s of Darkne&s;s for ever.</HI>&mdash;And in the Book of the <HI>Revelations</HI> it is writ|ten, that <HI>The Smoke of the Torments of the Wicked a&s;|cendeth for ever and ever.</HI>&mdash;And if we believe the Witne&s;s of Men in&s;pired, the Witne&s;s of the Son of GOD, who had the Spirit given him, as he was a Mediator, without Mea&s;ure, is &s;till far greater.&mdash;And he, in St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Go&s;pel, repeats this &s;olemn Decla|ration three &s;everal Times. <HI>It is better for Thee to enter into Life maimed</HI>; that is, it is better to forego the Gratification of thy Lu&s;t, or incur the Di&s;plea&s;ure of a Friend, which may be as dear to thee as a Hand, or as u&s;eful as a Foot, <HI>than having two Hands and Feet,</HI> that is, for indulging the one, or di&s;obeying GOD to oblige the other, <HI>to be ca&s;t into Hell, where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</HI></P>
<P>And here again, in the Words of the Text, <HI>The&s;e,</HI> that is, the Wicked, &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hall go away into everla&s;t|ing Puni&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>I know it has been objected by &s;ome who have de|nied the Eternity of Hell Torments,
<Q>That the Words <HI>Everla&s;ting</HI> and <HI>Ever and Ever,</HI> are often u&s;ed in the Holy Scriptures, (e&s;pecially in the <HI>Old-Te&s;tament</HI>) when they &s;ignify not an endle&s;s Dura|tion, but a limited Term of Time.</Q></P>
<P>And this we readily grant. But then we reply,
<Q>That when the Words are u&s;ed with this Limitati|on, they either manife&s;tly appear to be u&s;ed &s;o from the Context</Q>
&mdash;or are put in Oppo&s;ition to &s;ome
<PB N="6" REF="040229_0006_1015D50A74D38770">
occa&s;ional Types which GOD gave his People on &s;ome &s;pecial Occa&s;ions, as when it is &s;aid, <HI>it &s;hall be a perpe|tual or everla&s;ting Statute,</HI> or <HI>a Statute for ever,</HI> that is, a &s;tanding Type, and not merely tran&s;ient or occa&s;ion|al, as was the <HI>Pillar of Cloud,</HI> the <HI>Manna,</HI> or &s;uch like.&mdash;Or la&s;tly, they have a Relation, to that Cove|nant GOD made with his &s;piritual <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> which, if under&s;tood in a &s;piritual Sen&s;e, will be everla&s;ting, tho' the Ceremonial Di&s;pen&s;ation be aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it ought to be ob&s;erved, that, &s;ome of the Pa&s;&s;ages ju&s;t now referred to, have neither of the&s;e Words &s;o much as mentioned in them, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly be interpreted &s;o as to denote only a limited Term of Years.</P>
<P>But let that be as it will, it is evident even to a De|mon&s;tration, that the Words of the Text however, will not admit of &s;uch a re&s;trained Signification, as ap|pears from their being directly oppo&s;ed to the Words immediately following, <HI>viz. That the Righteous &s;hall go into Life eternal.</HI> From which Words, all are ready to grant, that the Life promi&s;ed to the Righteous will be Eternal; and why the Puni&s;hment threatned to the Wicked &s;hould not be under&s;tood to be Eternal like|wi&s;e, when the very &s;ame Word in the Original, is u&s;ed to expre&s;s the Duration of each, no Shadow of a Rea&s;on can be given.</P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> There cannot be one Argument ur|ged, why GOD &s;hould reward his Saints with everla&s;t|ing Happine&s;s, which will not equally puni&s;h Sinners with Eternal Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>For, &s;ince we know nothing (at lea&s;t for a Certain|ty) how he will deal with either, but by a Divine Re|velation; and &s;ince, as was proved by the foregoing
<PB N="7" REF="040229_0007_1015D51668C6DF90">
Argument, he hath as po&s;itively threatned eternally to puni&s;h the Wicked, as to reward the Good; it follows that his Truth will be as much impeached and called in Que&s;tion, did he not inflict his Puni&s;hments, as it would be, if he did not confer his Rewards.</P>
<P>To this al&s;o it has been objected,
<Q>That though GOD is obliged by his Promi&s;e to give his Rewards, yet his Veracity could not be called in Que&s;tion, &s;uppo&s;ing he &s;hould not execute his Threatnings, as he actually did not in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Nineveh,</HI> which GOD expre&s;ly declared by his Prophet <HI>Jonah, &s;hould be de&s;troyed in Forty Days</HI>; notwith&s;tanding the Sequel of the Story informs us, that <HI>Nineveh</HI> was &s;pared.</Q></P>
<P>But in an&s;wer to this Objection we affirm,
<Q>That GOD's Threatnings, as well as Promi&s;es, are with|out Repentance.</Q>
&mdash;And for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e they are both founded on the eternal Laws of right Rea&s;on.&mdash;Accordingly we always find, that where the Conditions were not performed, on the Non-perfor|mance of which the Threatnings were denounced, GOD always executed the Puni&s;hment threatned.&mdash; The driving <HI>Adam</HI> out of <HI>Eden,</HI>&mdash;The De&s;truction of the old World by a Deluge of Water, and the Over|throw of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> are, and will be always &s;o many &s;tanding Monuments of GOD's executing his Threatnings when denounced, though, to our weak Apprehen&s;ions, the Puni&s;hment may &s;eem far to exceed the Crime.</P>
<P>It is true, GOD did &s;pare <HI>Nineveh,</HI> and that becau&s;e the Inhabitants did actually repent, and therefore per|formed the Conditions upon which it was &s;uppo&s;ed by the Prophet's being &s;ent to warn them, the threatned Puni&s;hment &s;hould be with-held.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="040229_0008_1015D50C0CCE9C38">And &s;o likewi&s;e in re&s;pect to Go&s;pel Threatnings. If Men will &s;o far con&s;ult their own Welfare as to live up to the Go&s;pel Terms, GOD certainly will not puni&s;h them, but on the contrary, confer upon them his Rewards,&mdash;But to affirm that HE will not puni&s;h, and that eternally too, impenitent, ob&s;tinate Sinners, according as he hath threatned, if they do not perform the Terms of the Go&s;pel, what is it, in Effect, but to make GOD like a Man, that he &s;hould lie, or the Son of Man that he &s;hould repent?</P>
<P>But the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch an Opinion will appear &s;till more evident from</P>
<P>The next and <HI>Third</HI> Argument I &s;hall offer to prove, <HI>that the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereafter are eternal, viz.</HI> From the Nature of the Chri&s;tian Co|venant.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t again ob&s;erve, that it was taken for granted at the Beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e, that,
<Q>That you believe the Son of GOD came down to &s;ave Sinners; that there is but one Mediator be|tween GOD &amp; Man, even the Man CHRIST JESUS.</Q></P>
<P>And here I take it for granted farther (unle&s;s you believe the ab&s;urd and unwarrantable Doctrine of Pur|gatory) that you are fully per&s;uaded, that this Life is the only Time allotted by Almighty GOD for work|ing out our Salvation, and after a few Years are pa&s;&s;ed over, there will be no more Sacrifice for Sin.</P>
<P>And if this be granted (and who dares deny it) it follows that if a wicked Man dieth in his Wickedne&s;s, and under the Wrath of GOD, he mu&s;t continue in that State to all Eternity. &mdash; For, &s;ince there is no Po&s;&s;ibility of his being delivered out of &s;uch a Condi|tion but by and thro' CHRIST; and &s;ince at the Hour
<PB N="9" REF="040229_0009_1015D51802C3C380">
of Death, the Time of CHRIST'S Mediation and In|terce&s;&s;ion for him is irrecoverably gone; the &s;ame Rea|&s;on that may be given, why GOD &s;hould puni&s;h a Sinner that dieth under the Guilt of his Sins for a &s;ingle Day, will equally hold good, why he &s;hould continue to puni&s;h him for a Year, an Age, nay, to all Eternity.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to the <HI>Fourth</HI> and la&s;t Argument, to prove, <HI>That the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked here|after are eternal,</HI> viz. <HI>Becau&s;e the Devil's Puni&s;hment is to be &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>That there is &s;uch a Being whom we call the <HI>Devil,</HI> that he was once an Angel of Light, but for his Pride and Rebellion again&s;t GOD, was ca&s;t down from Heaven, and is now permitted with the re&s;t of his &s;pi|ritual Wickedne&s;&s;es, to walk to and fro, &s;eeking whom they may devour. &mdash; That there is a Place of Tor|ment re&s;erved for them, or, to u&s;e the Apo&s;tle's Words, <HI>that they are re&s;erved in everla&s;ting Chains under Dark|ne&s;s unto the Judgment of the Great Day,</HI> are Truths all here pre&s;ent were &s;uppo&s;ed to be convinced of, when it was taken for granted under the &s;econd Propo&s;ition at the Beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e, that you believed the <HI>holy Scriptures</HI> to be written by the In&s;piration of GOD, wherein the&s;e Truths are delivered.</P>
<P>But then if we allow all this, and think it no In|ju&s;tice in GOD to puni&s;h tho&s;e glorious Spirits for their Rebellion, how can we think it unju&s;t in him, to puni&s;h wicked Men for their Impenitency to all Eternity?</P>
<P>You will &s;ay perhaps, that they have &s;inned again&s;t greater Light, and therefore de&s;erve a greater Puni&s;h|ment. And &s;o we grant that the Puni&s;hment of the fallen Angels may be greater as to Degree, than that of wicked Men. But then we affirm, it will be equal as
<PB N="10" REF="040229_0010_1015D519A87698C8">
to the Eternal Duration of it. For in that Day, as the lively Oracles of GOD inform us, &s;hall the Son of Man &s;ay to them on his left Hand, <HI>Depart from me ye Cur&s;ed into Everla&s;ting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI> &mdash; Where we find that impenitent Sinners are to be ca&s;t into the &s;ame <HI>Everla&s;ting Fire,</HI> with the <HI>Devil</HI> and his Angels, &mdash; and that too very ju&s;tly. &mdash; For though they may have &s;inned again&s;t greater Light, yet Chri&s;tians &s;in again&s;t greater Mercy. Since CHRIST took not hold of, did not die for the fallen Angels, but of the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> for Men and for our Salvation. So that if GOD &s;pared not tho&s;e excellent Beings, a&s;&s;ure thy &s;elf, O ob&s;tinate Sin|ner, whoever thou art, he will by no means &s;pare thee.</P>
<P>From what then has been &s;aid it plainly appears, that verily the <HI>Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereaf|ter are Eternal.</HI> &mdash; And if &s;o, Brethren, how holy ought we to be in all Manner of Conver&s;ation and Godline&s;s, that we may be accounted worthy to e&s;cape this Wrath to come!</P>
<P>But before I proceed to a practical Exhortation, permit me to draw an Inference or two from what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, <HI>If the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal,</HI> what &s;hall we &s;ay to tho&s;e who make an open Profe&s;&s;ion in their Creed to believe a Life everla&s;ting, <HI>i. e.</HI> a Life of Happine&s;s as well as Mi&s;ery, and yet dare to live in the actual Com|mi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Sins which will unavoidably, without Repentance, bring them into the Place of Torment? Thou believe&s;t the Puni&s;hment of the impenitently Wicked in another Life, are Eternal: Thou doe&s;t well, <HI>The Devils al&s;o believe and tremble.</HI> But know,
<PB N="11" REF="040229_0011_1015D5250180E728">
O vain Man, unle&s;s this Belief doth Influence thy Practice, and makes thee bid Adieu to thy Sins, every Time thou repeate&s;t thy Creed, thou do&s;t in Effect &s;ay, I believe I &s;hall be undone for ever.</P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> If the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal, then let this &s;erve as a Caution to &s;uch Per&s;ons (and it is to be fear'd there are &s;ome &s;uch) who go about to di&s;&s;uade others from the Belief of &s;uch an important Truth. There being no &s;urer Way, in all Probability, to encourage &amp; pro|mote Infidelity and Prophanene&s;s, than the broaching or maintaining &s;uch an unwarrantable Doctrine. &mdash; For if the po&s;itive Threats of GOD concerning the Eternity of Hell-Torments are already found in&s;uffi|cient to deter Men from Sin, what a higher Pitch of Wickedne&s;s may we imagine they will quickly arrive at, when they are taught to entertain any Hopes of a future Recovery out of them, or, what is &s;till wor&s;e, that their Souls are hereafter to be annihilated, and be|come like the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h? &mdash; But Woe unto &s;uch blind Leaders of the Blind. No Wonder if they both fall into the Ditch. &mdash; And let &s;uch Corrupters of GOD's Word know, that I te&s;tify unto every Man that heareth me this Day, that if any one &s;hall add unto, or take away from the Words that are written in the Book of GOD, GOD &s;hall take his Part out of the Book of Life, and &s;hall add unto him all the Plagues that are in that Book.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> and <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> If the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereafter are eternal, then this may &s;erve as a Reproof for tho&s;e who quarrel with GOD, and &s;ay it is incon&s;i&s;tent with his Ju&s;tice, to puni&s;h a Per&s;on to all Eternity, only for enjoying the Plea&s;ures of Sin for a
<PB N="12" REF="040229_0012_1015BDA4FA9A2AB0">
Sea&s;on. But &s;uch Per&s;ons mu&s;t be told, that it is not their thinking or calling GOD unju&s;t, will make him &s;o, no more than a condemned Pri&s;oner's &s;aying the Law or Judge is unju&s;t, will render either duly charge|able with &s;uch an Imputation. &mdash; But knowe&s;t thou, O Worm, what Bla&s;phemy thou art guilty of, in char|ging GOD with Inju&s;tice? &mdash; <HI>Shall the Thing formed &s;ay to him that formed it, Why ha&s;t thou made me thus?</HI> And wilt thou pre&s;ume to arraign the Almighty at the Bar of thy &s;hallow Rea&s;oning? And call him unju&s;t, for puni&s;hing thee Eternally, only becau&s;e thou wi&s;h|e&s;t it may not &s;o? But hath GOD &s;aid it; and &s;hall he not do it? He hath &s;aid it: And let GOD be true, tho' every Man be a Liar.&mdash;<HI>Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</HI> A&s;&s;uredly he will. And if Sinners will not own his Ju&s;tice in his Threatnings here, they will be compell'd e'er long to own and feel them when tormented by him hereafter.</P>
<P>But to come to a more practical Application of what has been deliver'd.</P>
<P>You have heard, Brethren, the Eternity of Hell-Torments plainly proved, from the expre&s;s Declarati|ons of Holy Scriptures, and Con&s;equences naturally drawn from them.&mdash;And now there &s;eems to need no great Art of Rhetorick to per&s;uade any under&s;tanding Per&s;on to avoid and abhor tho&s;e Sins, which without Repentance, will certainly plunge him into this Eternal Gulph.&mdash;The Di&s;proportion between the Plea&s;ure and the Pain (if there be any Plea&s;ure in Sin) is &s;o infi|nitely great, that &s;uppo&s;ing it was only po&s;&s;ible tho' not certain, that the Wicked would be everla&s;tingly puni&s;hed, no one that has the Rea&s;on of a Man, for the Enjoying a little momentary Plea&s;ure, would,
<PB N="13" REF="040229_0013_1015D52819CB9F58">
one would imagine, run the Hazard of enduring Eter|nal Pain.&mdash;But &s;ince the Torments of the Damned are not only po&s;&s;ible, but certain, (&s;ince GOD him|&s;elf, who cannot lie, has told us &s;o) for Men, not|with&s;tanding to per&s;i&s;t in their Di&s;obedience, and then flatter them&s;elves that GOD will not make good his Threatnings, is a mo&s;t egregious In&s;tance of Folly and Pre&s;umption.</P>
<P><HI>Dives</HI> him&s;elf &s;uppo&s;ed, that if one ro&s;e from the Dead, his Brethren would amend their Lives; but Chri&s;tians, it &s;eems, will not repent though the SON OF GOD has died and ro&s;e again, and told them what they mu&s;t expect, if they &s;till continue ob&s;tinate in Evil Doing.</P>
<P>Would we now and then draw off our Thoughts from &s;en&s;ible Objects, and by Faith, meditate a while on the Mi&s;eries of the Damned, I doubt not but we &s;hould, as it were, hear many an unhappy Soul vent|ing his fruitle&s;s Sorrows in &s;ome &s;uch piteous Moans as the&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>O Wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from this Body of Death! O fooli&s;h Mortal that I was, thus to bring my&s;elf into the&s;e never-cea&s;ing Tortures, for the transitory Enjoyment of a few &s;hortlived Plea&s;ures, which &s;carcely afforded me any Satisfaction, even when I mo&s;t indulged my&s;elf in them.&mdash;Alas! are the&s;e the Wages, the&s;e the Ef|fects of Sin? &mdash; Are all the Grand Deceiver's invi|ting Promi&s;es come to this?&mdash;O Damned Apo&s;tate! Fir&s;t to delude me with pretended Promi&s;es of Hap|pine&s;s, and after &s;everal Years Drudgery in his Ser|vice, thus to involve me in Eternal Woe.&mdash;Oh that I had never hearkened to his beguiling In&s;inuations!

Oh that I had rejected his very fir&s;t Sugge&s;tions with the utmo&s;t Dete&s;tation and Abhorrence! Oh that I had taken up my Cro&s;s and followed CHRIST! Oh that I had never ridiculed &s;erious Godline&s;s; and out of a fal&s;e Politene&s;s, condemned the truly Pious, as too Severe, Enthu&s;ia&s;tick, or Super&s;titious! For I then had been happy indeed, happy beyond Expre&s;&s;i|on, happy to all Eternity, yonder in tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Regions where they &s;it, cloathed with un&s;peakable Glory, and chanting forth their Seraphick Hallelu|jahs to the Lamb that &s;itteth upon the Throne, for ever.&mdash;But, alas! the&s;e Reflections come now too late: The&s;e Wi&s;hes now are vain and fruitle&s;s.
