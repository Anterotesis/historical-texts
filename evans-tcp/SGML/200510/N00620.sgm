<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Doctrine which Concerns the Mini&s;try of HOLY ANGELS, is a Subject mo&s;t worthy to be Searched into. Several Learned Men have Publi&s;hed Elaborate &amp; Solid Di&s;cour&s;es thereon: In &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cial <HI>Zanchy, Ri|vius, and Stuckius.</HI> There are al&s;o &s;undry U&s;eful <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Treati&s;es, in which this Argument is Judi|ciou&s;ly Handled. Particularly, by Bi&s;hop <HI>Hall,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI>; This notwith|&s;tanding, a Learned Divine Laments, that there are &s;o few Books Written, or Sermons Preached, concerning the Angels, of whom the Scripture &s;peaks &s;o much. I have from that Con&s;ideration been Induced to Publi&s;h what is Emitted here|with. As for <HI>Philo&s;ophical Que&s;tions</HI> about the Na|ture of Angels, and the way of their Under&s;tand|ing Things, whether it be <HI>Per Species Intelligibiles In&s;itas vel Acqui&s;itas,</HI> and many the like, which <HI>Thomi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Scoti&s;ts</HI> have &s;uch wrangling Conte&s;ts about, I have wholly declined them. <HI>Heerboord</HI> in his Select Di&s;putations, and <HI>Schiebler,</HI> in his

To offer &s;uch things un|to a Popular Auditory, would be to feed them with Stones in&s;tead of Bread. Nor have I deter|mined any thing concerning that Problem, <HI>Whe|ther every man has a particular Angel to be his con&s;tant Companion, from the time of his Birth to his Death?</HI> The <HI>Platonicks,</HI> and other <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> among the Gentiles of old, did believe it, unto an high De|gree of Super&s;tition: A Magician advi&s;ed <HI>Antho|ny</HI> not to contend with <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> becau&s;e he &s;aid the <HI>Genius</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> was the mo&s;t Powerful&punc; The Jews are per&s;waded, that there is an Ange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Guardian deputed to each particular man. Thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Cabbali&s;ts,</HI> (which are too much favoured by <HI>Mer&s;ennus</HI>) undertake to tell us, what were the Names of the Angel Guardians belonging to <HI>Adam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Shem,</HI> and <HI>Abraham.</HI> V. <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi Examen Fludd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Philos. p.</HI> 243. Another Author (<HI>Cae&s;ar Longinus, p.</HI> 476.) tells us, who were the Angels of <HI>Jo&s;eph, Jo&s;hua, David Eli&s;ha,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>P&s;ellus</HI> has Written a Book <HI>De proprio Daemone.</HI> And all the Pontificial Doctors mentain the Affirmative of the <HI>Problem</HI> mentioned, unto which al&s;o &s;ome Eminent Prote|&s;tant Divines incline, though not as Comprehen|ding every man, only every Elect Ve&s;&s;el; groun|ding their Belief chiefly on tho&s;e two Scriptures, <HI>Math.</HI> 18.10. and <HI>Acts</HI> 12.15. The very Learn|ed, and very Pious Doctor <HI>Rivet,</HI> (according to his u&s;ual manner) expre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf with grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB REF="000756_0007_0FAA4914E65F0B38">
Caution and Judgment concerning it. <HI>That every One of them, who &s;hall be Heirs of Salvation, has, be&s;ides what may be, with him on extraordinary Occa|&s;ions, always One particular Angel with him, he &s;uppo|&s;es it to be a probable Truth, and that it is not again&s;t the Scripture. Neverthele&s;s, that we cannot from thence Infer, that it is alwayes the &s;ame Angel</HI>: He adds, <HI>That it is an Opinion not worth the Contending about.</HI></P>
<P>I have therefore Declined that Que&s;tion, and endeavoured (&s;o far as I am able to Di&s;cern) to keep unto clear Scripture Revelation, in what I have delivered; and &s;o to &s;peak, as that the mo&s;t ordinary Capacities might Under&s;tand and be Edified. I have not Lie&s;ure to Tran&s;cribe my own Notes: Therefore, The&s;e Sermons (as well as &s;ome, on other Subjects lately &s;ent to the Pre&s;s) are Pub|li&s;hed, as they were taken from me, in Short-Hand, by One of my Hearers. I have peru&s;ed them, and here Pre&s;ent them without any great Alteration. The Ingenuous Reader will pardon the Inculcations in them, con&s;idering to whom they were Preached, and for who&s;e &s;ake they are, in this way made publick.</P>
<P>ANGELS (both the Good and Evil Ones) have a greater Influence on this World, than men are generally aware of. <HI>Monitions</HI> of Dan|gers, and of Great Changes are oftentimes from Good Angels. <HI>Beza</HI> was &s;trangely affected with a Dream, which he Communicated to the Magi|&s;trates of <HI>Geneva,</HI> by means whereof the City
<PB REF="000756_0008_0FAA4915B48BF720">
was Saved from an Impending Mi&s;chief. This could not be from an Evil Angel. Neverthele&s;s, Providence does &s;ometimes Permit and Order Moni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions of Future Evils by them: Thus <HI>Brutus</HI> was by a <HI>Daemon</HI> Fore-warned of his Death. Arch-bi&s;hop <HI>Spotwood</HI> Writes, that One of the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> was terrified with the Vi&s;ion of a Per&s;on, whom he had cau&s;ed to Sin much a|gain&s;t his Con&s;cience, who C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yed to him. <HI>Wo worth the Day that ever I knew thee, for becau&s;e I have &s;ought to plea&s;e thee again&s;t God and His Ser|vants, I am now adjudged to the Torments of Hell.</HI> The next morning he under&s;tood, that that man was dead, and that he dyed ju&s;t at the Hour, when he appeared to him, after that affrighting manner. He al&s;o dreamed that Sir <HI>James Ha|milton,</HI> whom he had cau&s;ed to be Executed, came to him with a Drawn Sword, and therewith cut off both his Arms, whil&s;t he was mu&s;ing what &s;hould be the meaning of that Dream, News was brought him of the Death of both his Sons. Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tories report, that the Lord <HI>Stanly,</HI> had a Dream, in which it &s;eemed to him, that a Boar Gored him, and the Lord <HI>Ha&s;tings</HI>; and becau&s;e the D. of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> gave the Boar for his Arms or Cognizance, it made a dreadful Impre&s;|&s;ion upon his Spirit, that mi&s;chief was by him &s;e|cretly intended ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in&s;t them. He that Night &s;ent to the Lord <HI>Ha&s;tings</HI> about it, who looked on it, as no more than a Dream or Phan&s;y; but the next day, the Lord <HI>Stanly</HI> was Wounded, and the
<PB REF="000756_0009_0FAA4916C279DD88">
Lord <HI>Ha&s;tings</HI> was Murthered by the Bloody Treachery of that Boar, the D. of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> who was afterwards K. <HI>Richard</HI> 3. And we know from the Scripture, that an Evil Angel foretold, the Fall of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and the Great Mutations, which &s;hould then happen, in the Kingdom of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> Jewi&s;h Commentators &s;ay, that the Rea&s;on, why <HI>Saul</HI> cut off the Witches throughout the Land, was, becau&s;e they Foretold that <HI>David</HI> &s;hould be King. I Remember, that once in Di&s;cour&s;e with the Learned Doctor <HI>Spen|cer,</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> concerning his Book of Prodi|gies, he &s;aid to me, that his Judgment was, <HI>That the Evil Angels had</HI> Praenotions <HI>of many Future Things, and did accordingly give &s;trange</HI> Premoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|ons <HI>of them.</HI> No doubt it is often &s;o, and yet as <HI>Lavater, Schottus,</HI> and others have noted, there are &s;ometimes Things &s;ignified by <HI>Angels,</HI> which it is not ea&s;y to determine of what &s;ort tho&s;e <HI>Genii</HI> are. What &s;hall be thought of the <HI>Phantom,</HI> which appeared to General <HI>Ve&s;&s;elini,</HI> a&s;&s;uring him that he might take the City of <HI>Muran,</HI> by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Widow which Lived in that Ci|ty, which &s;trangely came to pa&s;s accordingly, in the Year 1644. There comes to my mind a very Unaccountable Thing, which happened at <HI>London</HI> above Thirty Years ago. It was this, One Mr. <HI>Cutty</HI> (an hone&s;t Citizen) pa&s;&s;ing between <HI>Milk-&s;treet</HI> and <HI>Wood &s;treet</HI> in <HI>Cheap-&s;ide,</HI> on <HI>March</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> 1664. took up a Letter Sealed. The Super&s;cripti|on whereof was the&s;e words following; <HI>From
<PB REF="000756_0010_0FAA49175FB03690">
Geneva, to a Friend.</HI> Within the Letter the&s;e words were Written.
<Q>This is to give both timely and &s;peedy Notice, that in the Year 1665. in the latter end of <HI>May,</HI> &s;hall begin a Plague, and hold very Hot, till the latter end of <HI>December,</HI> and then cea&s;e, but not quite; and then go on, till the latter end of the Spring the next Year. And in 1665 and 66. putting both together, &s;hall not only happen a Plague, but great Sea Fights, &s;uch as the like was &s;carce ever heard of; and this &s;hall not be all, but in the Year 1666. on the Second of <HI>September,</HI> &s;hall happen a Fire, that &s;hall Burn down One of the Eminente&s;t Cities in the World.</Q>
Mr. <HI>Cutty</HI> carried the Letter to the then Lord Mayor. A Reverend Divine in <HI>London,</HI> who was of his Ac|quaintance, had a Copy of it, before the &s;ad Things here Praedicted came to pa&s;s; and at my la&s;t being at <HI>London,</HI> was plea&s;ed to favour me with it, as 'tis here Related. This Account bing certainly true, and very &s;urprizing, I thought it not unworthy the Publication.</P>
<P>As for the annexed Di&s;cour&s;e, concerning <HI>Ange|lical Apparitions,</HI> more In&s;tances than one or two, here in <HI>New-England,</HI> of Appearing Pretended Angels, have made it nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;omething &s;hould be Written to prevent the Deception of &s;everal that have been, and of others, that were in Eminent Danger of being Impo&s;ed upon. Some may think it Extraordinary, That &s;uch Things &s;hould happen in a Place, where the Light of
<PB REF="000756_0011_0FAA4918186813D0">
the Go&s;pel (which has ever been wont to &s;hine away the Angels of Darkne&s;s) does prevail. But it is no new thing for men to be thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded. Some Good men have Credited &s;trange Relations about <HI>Apparitions of Saints Departed,</HI> as well as of Angels. <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> in his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, (<HI>Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>cap.</HI> 4.) reports that <HI>Potamiaena,</HI> three days after her Martyrdom, appeared to <HI>Ba&s;ilides,</HI> and cau&s;ed him to turn a Chri&s;tian; and after|wards to many in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> on whom the <HI>Ap|parition</HI> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the like Effect. Fabulous Relations (and &s;uch I take tho&s;e of <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> to be) are more like to Confirm Infidels, than to make Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>I have rea&s;on to believe, that it has been a &s;ig|nal Mercy to this Country, that the pretended Angels have been &s;u&s;pected to be no better than <HI>Satan transforming him&s;elf into an Angel of Light.</HI> Nor is it at all to be wondred at, that the Spirits of Darkne&s;s &s;hould be able to Deceive mens Sen|&s;es; making them believe that they &s;ee that which is not. A man that is Skilled in Opticks, may Impo&s;e on the Sen&s;es of others, as did <HI>De&s;cartes,</HI> when he cau&s;ed Admiration in his Friend <HI>Bra&s;&s;ieus</HI> by Repre&s;enting to him a Company of Souldiers, marching in his Chamber; but this proceeded from the &s;mall Figures of Souldiers which he concealed, and by a Gla&s;s brought &s;uch multiplied without doors. And who, that has Read <HI>Porta, Longi|nus, Zimara, Weckerus,</HI> or &s;uch like Writers, knows not that by Natural, without Super&s;titious Magic,
<PB REF="000756_0012_0FAA4918A0BA0188">
Things of this Nature may be done? How ea&s;y then is it for <HI>Daemons,</HI> who have a perfect Under|&s;tanding in <HI>Opticks,</HI> and in the Power of Nature to deceive the Eyes, and delude the Imaginations of Silly Mortals?</P>
<P>It was in my thoughts to have Written &s;ome|thing concerning that Power, which by the Per|mi&s;&s;ion, and Righteous Judgment of God, the E|vil Angels have over the &s;inful, mi&s;erable Chil|dren of men. There are &s;ome, who will not Believe, that ever a Wizzard or C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">njurer &s;hould be able to &s;et the Devils upon their Neighbours, or that tho&s;e Infernal Spirits &s;hould have Power to Hurt them. But the Scriptures a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>Balak</HI> &s;ent for that Infamous South&s;ayer <HI>Balaam,</HI> to Cur&s;e his Enemies, which he would never have do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> if it had not been a thing notoriou&s;ly known, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat <HI>Balaam</HI> could by his Charms do &s;uch things. And the rea&s;on of his being no more affrighted when his A&s;s &s;poke to him, was doubt|le&s;s becau&s;e he did not at fir&s;t think that it was a Good Angel that &s;poke, but rather one of tho&s;e Evil Spirits with whom he had maintained a fa|miliar Conver&s;ation. Nor can it be denyed, but that there are cur&s;ed Books in the World, which In&s;truct men what Ceremonies they mu&s;t u&s;e, and what Words they mu&s;t utter, that &s;o when the <HI>Signals</HI> which are of the Devils <HI>In&s;titution,</HI> are ob&s;erved, he may do what his Wor&s;hippers de&s;ire of him, &s;o far as the mo&s;t High &s;hall give him
<PB REF="000756_0013_0FAA491AC62EBF98">
Leave, without who&s;e Permi&s;&s;ion he cannot &s;o much as enter into any man's Swine. The Super&s;titious Gentiles of Old, &s;et a very High Price on &s;uch DIABOLLICAL-BOOKS. The Converted <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> burnt tho&s;e Books, and they counted the Price of them, and found it to be Fifty thou&s;and Pieces of Silver, which amounts to One Thou&s;and Five Hundred Sixty Two Pounds, Ten Shillings, Engli&s;h Money, <HI>Acts</HI> 19.19. Becau&s;e the <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> were notorious for doing Mi&s;chief by Magical Spells [<HI>EPHESIA GRAM|MATA</HI>] became a Proverb. That &s;uch In|&s;truments of Satan cannot always hurt whom they would is mo&s;t certain. <HI>Cyprian</HI> (who was after|wards a famous Mini&s;ter and Martyr) found it to be &s;o, when he made the Attempt. It is Related in the Life of <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> that Magicians did in vain &s;eek to do him Hurt. One that many years &s;ince was Executed at <HI>Hartford,</HI> in <HI>Connecti|cut</HI>-Colony, on the Account of Witchcraft, con|fe&s;&s;ed, that &s;he had Employed Evil Spirits to be Revenged on &s;everal; but that when &s;he would have had them do the like to Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> (the Eminent Teacher of the Church there) they told her, they had not leave to do it: Nor is this to be Evaded by &s;aying &s;ome Per&s;ons (as of late in <HI>New England</HI>) have fal&s;ly accu&s;ed them&s;elves, for this Per&s;on was upon Rational Grounds, thought to be a true Penitent, before her death. We cannot argue, that becau&s;e &s;ome have failed in their cur&s;ed Attempts, that therefore never
<PB REF="000756_0014_0FAA491AEC839588">
any Succeeded. But the known Succe&s;s of many was that which Emboldned others to Endeavour the like. Some of the Indian <HI>Pawaws (i. e.</HI> Wiz|zards) in this Country, having received the Go&s;|pel, and given Good Evidence of a True Conver|&s;ion to God in Chri&s;t, have, with much &s;or|row of Heart, declared how they had, whil&s;t in their <HI>Heatheni&s;m,</HI> by the hands of Evil Angels Murdered their Neighbours. There are, who, by <HI>Spells</HI> or Muttering a few words, have cau&s;ed Di&s;ea&s;es to be Removed from tho&s;e, that have applyed them&s;elves to them. It is Impudence to Deny this, &s;ince the Per&s;ons are Extant among us, concerning whom it is to be Averred. But if the <HI>Charms</HI> of Impious <HI>Sorcerers,</HI> will cau&s;e Invi&s;ible Agents, to heal Di&s;ea&s;es, Rea&s;on &s;ays, they may as well have Power to Inflict them. The&s;e are plain, clear Arguments, and it is more ea&s;y to Slight and Ridicule them, than to give a Refuta|tion of them. But of this, no more, nor have I mentioned The&s;e Things, as expecting that <HI>Sad|duces</HI> or <HI>Semi&s;adduces,</HI> who are Judicially harden|ed in their Error, will be Convinced and Conver|ted (for no Arguments in the World will ever do that) Neverthele&s;s, others will be Confirmed in the Truth thereby.</P>
<P>We ought to Admire the Grace of God to|wards us Sinful Creatures, in that, He has ap|pointed His Holy Angels to Guard us again&s;t the Mi&s;chiefs de&s;igned by Wicked Spirits, who are
<PB REF="000756_0015_0FAA491BF0CEFEC0">
alwayes Intending our Hurt, both as to our Bodies and Souls. After the P&s;alme&s;t had &s;aid, <HI>The An|gel of the Lord Encampeth round about them that Fear Him, and delivereth them,</HI> he adds immedi|ately O! <HI>Ta&s;t and &s;ee that the Lord is Good</HI>; herein <HI>Good,</HI> in be&s;towing &s;uch a <HI>Guard</HI> upon us. It was (as that Great Divine Doctor <HI>Arrow&s;mith</HI> well ob&s;erves) an Act of Royal Benignity towards <HI>Mordecai,</HI> in King <HI>Aha&s;huerus,</HI> to make the chief Favourite in the Court his Attendant; but how much Greater is this Kindne&s;s? That the Ble&s;&s;ed Angels, tho&s;e Fevourites in the Court of Hea|ven, &s;hould be Mini&s;tring Spirits for them, that &s;hall be Heirs of Salvation!

and wonderfully to deliver his Servant. The means of which Deliverance, is noted in this Text and Context.</P>
<P N="1">1. Prayer unto God, was a means thereof: <HI>Da|vid</HI> him&s;elf did Pray. At that time, he could not make any Prayer more than Ejaculatory, &s;uch as <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> in great Di&s;tre&s;s did; he li&s;ted up his He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t, and the Cries of his Soul came before God. Thus in the 4<HI>th.</HI> ver&s;e, <HI>I &s;ought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.</HI> And in the 6<HI>th.</HI> ver&s;e, <HI>This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and &s;aved him out of all his troubles.</HI> And not only did <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf Cry unto the Lord, but he had many Godly Friends, who knowing where he was, Prayed earne&s;tly for him, <HI>ver&s;e.</HI> 5. <HI>They looked unto him, and were light|ned. Davids</HI> Godly Friends, Looked up to Hea|ven on his behalf, and God was plea&s;ed to an&s;wer them, to their great lightning and con&s;olation.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another means of his Deliverance, is men|tioned in the words before us, which are expre&s;|&s;ive of the benefit <HI>David</HI> received by the Mini&s;try of Holy Angels: God Commands his Angels to Encamp round about his Servants, and to Deliver them. A man that hath Enemies, if there be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Army round him, may, notwith&s;tanding his Dangers be Delivered. Thus it was with <HI>David:</HI> and thus 'tis with all that truly fear God: There is an Ho&s;t, an Army about them. One Angel is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble to defend many again&s;t their Enemies: yet &s;uch is the Care of God concerning, and &s;uch his

Love towards his Children, as that he appoints many Angels, on Occa&s;ion, no le&s;s than an Ho&s;t, enough to make a Camp, to Save one Servant of his.</P>
<P>There are then two <HI>Doctrines</HI> before us.</P>

the Great Day.</HI> The&s;e things then make it clear unto us who believe the Scriptures, that there are &s;uch real Beings as Angels. And indeed, rea&s;on doth dictate no le&s;s unto men; for it is evident, that there are Evil Angels: Men cannot but per|ceive that. And it was manife&s;t from the Ora|cles of the Gentiles of old; the Evil Angels did &s;peak in them. This al&s;o is &s;adly evident from Bodily Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, of which every Age gives in&s;tances to the World. Now then, if there are Evil Angels, rea&s;on &s;aith, they were once good: they are not originally Evil. The Creator, who is Perfect, Infinite, Goodne&s;s, did not make them Evil: they mu&s;t needs come Holy out of His Hands. And if the Evil Angels were once good, we may rationally conclude, that there are &s;ome who are as originally they were Holy Spirits. Hence the Gentiles, who had not the Light of Scripture to inform them; neverthele&s;s believed, that there were good, as well as evil Spirits. They have &s;aid of God, that He is [<HI>PATER AN|DRONTE THEONTE</HI>] the Father of Spirits, as well as the Father of Men.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE. 2. That they, who truly fear God, have many deliverances, and receive many benefits, by the Mini&s;try of Holy Angels.</HEAD>
<P>For the clearing of this Doctrine, there are three Particulars, which may be enquired into.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Who are the Object of the Care and in&s;pection of the Angels of Heaven?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What Benefits they that fear God, receive by the Mini&s;try of His Holy Angels?</HI></P>

<P>For <HI>An&s;wer,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Church of God is the &s;pecial Object of the Care and Tutelage of His Holy Angels.</HI> This might be &s;ignified to us by tho&s;e <HI>Cherubims,</HI> that were on the Curtains belonging to the Tabernacle, of which you read, <HI>Exod.</HI> 26.1. And al&s;o by the <HI>Che|rubims,</HI> that were drawn on the Walls of the Tem|ple, declaring this My&s;tery to us, that there is a Communion between the Angels in Heaven, and the Church on Earth, and that the Church is

Surrounded with Angels, as the Temple was with Cherubims. The Elect of God are &s;aid to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Church of the fir&s;t-born,</HI> who&s;e names are writ|ten in Heaven: Now the Scripture is expre&s;s and clear, that <HI>All</HI> the Angels of Heaven (not one excepted) are made u&s;e of to promote the Sal|vation of the Elect of God: Heb. 1.14. <HI>Are they not all Mini&s;tring Spirits, &s;ent forth to Mini&s;ter for them, who &s;hall be the heirs of Salvation?</HI> And there|fore particular Churches and Societies of Saints are under a &s;pecial In&s;pection of the Angels of God. As the Church of the Jews of old was favoured &amp; honoured with that priviledge, as we &s;ee in <HI>Dan.</HI> 12.1. So we have rea&s;on to conclude, that Churches con&s;i&s;ting of Chri&s;tians, are under a peculiar In|&s;pection of Elect Angels. If particular Countries and Provinces, are under their Guardian&s;hip, (as there is rea&s;on to believe) particular Churches are &s;o much more, as being more eminently under the care of Chri&s;t, the Lord of Angels. It is cer|tain (as the Text before us doth intimate) that in a mo&s;t peculiar manner, &s;uch as truly fear God, receive advantage, by the Mini&s;try of Holy An|gels: But for their &s;akes, others are al&s;o benefited thereby. Hypocrites, who are only external Wor|&s;hipers of God, are many wayes benefited by the Mini&s;tration of Angels, for the &s;ake of them, who are &s;incere. Every man in the Church of I&s;rael did receive benefit by the Mini&s;try of the Angels of Heaven: they <HI>All</HI> did eat of the <HI>Manna</HI>; which Manna was prepared by Angels. There|fore
<PB N="29" REF="000756_0045_0FAA4938C1D68520">
it is &s;aid, that <HI>Man did eat Angels Food,</HI> P&s;al. 78.25. Becau&s;e the Manna was prepared for them by the Angels. So is it now in the days of the Go&s;|pel, when God doth provide Spiritual food for men, all that are the Objects thereof, are or may be better for it. Where there are faithful, able Preachers of the Word of God, all have the ad|vantage of that Light: Now &s;uch things are by Chri&s;t's appointment brought to pa&s;s, by the Se|cret Invi&s;ible Mini&s;try of Angels. When <HI>Peter</HI> was &s;ent to Preach the Go&s;pel to <HI>Cornelius,</HI> and his Family, it was an Angel that did direct him unto them. When <HI>Paul</HI> and other Mini&s;ters Preached the Go&s;pel to the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> an Angel of Heaven by Divine Appointment, cau&s;ed them to do it, <HI>Acts.</HI> 16.9. Paul had a Vi&s;ion, there &s;tood a man of Macedonia, and Prayed him &s;ay|ing, <HI>Come over into Macedonia, and help us</HI>: h. e. He &s;aw an Angel habited like a Macedonian, who &s;pake tho&s;e Words to him, whence he and others with him concluded, that they were called to Preach the Go&s;pel in Macedonia, and that God and his Angels would be with them there. Towns and Cities in which there are Churches of Saints Wor&s;hipping God in Chri&s;t, have no doubt their peculiar Angels to watch over them. When Je|ru&s;alem was be&s;ieged by the A&s;&s;yrians, it is &s;aid the Angel of the Lord <HI>went out</HI> and &s;mote the Camp of the A&s;&s;yrians, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 19.35. It &s;eems then, there was an Angel that did re&s;ide in and pre&s;ide over that City, where the Temple was, who upon

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Care and In&s;pection of Angels, is not Limi|ted to the Church only.</HI> That in a &s;pecial manner, is the Object thereof; yet for the Churches &s;ake, their Care and Tutelage doth extend much fur|ther.

This the Angel did out of re&s;pect to the Lord's People&punc; For <HI>Darius</HI> him&s;elf was an Idolater, and not a Wor&s;hipper of God.

in <HI>Heaven</HI> as a <HI>Watch-Tower,</HI> and they keep the World. Hence <HI>Daniel</HI> &s;aw a <HI>Watcher,</HI> an Holy One, come down from Heaven. <HI>Dan.</HI> 4.13. The Angels are tho&s;e <HI>Holy Ones,</HI> that Watch the World: They are the great Intelligencers of Heaven, whom the Lord Chri&s;t &s;ends throughout the Earth, to ob&s;erve, and give him an account, how the Affairs thereof are. We &s;ee in the fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Zachary,</HI> that the Angels come unto the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the Increated An|gel, and the Lord of all the Angels: they &s;ay to him, <HI>We have Walked to and fro thorow the Earth, and behold, all the Earth is at re&s;t.</HI> v. 11. Thus do they in&s;pect the World, and give an account of their Mini&s;try. Hence it is &s;aid, that the <HI>Living Creatures,</HI> (Angels I told you are meant by the Living Creatures) <HI>ran and returned, as the appea|rance of a Fla&s;h of Lightning.</HI> Ezek. 1.14. When the Lord &s;ends them on an Errand, <HI>they Run,</HI> and <HI>they Return</HI> again, when they have di&s;patched the bu&s;ine&s;s they were &s;ent upon. And they run as &s;wiftly as a fla&s;h of Lightning: they go from Heaven to Earth, and from Earth to Heaven like Lightning. Although they that fear the Lord, are the peculiar Charge of Holy Angels, whom they con&s;tantly attend; neverthele&s;s, that the World in general is under their In&s;pection, is evi|dent from the Scriptures: For</P>

They are unto &s;uch as fear God, as a Lamp, to direct and light them: but they are unto wicked men, as Coals of Fire to con&s;ume them. This we &s;ee de&s;cribed at large in the 6<HI>th</HI> Chapter of <HI>Zachary,</HI> from the fir&s;t to the ninth ver&s;e; where we read of four Chariots, that is to &s;ay, the Angels of God, &s;ent forth into the four Cor|ners of the World, North, South, Ea&s;t &amp; We&s;t: and the Hor&s;es that repre&s;ent the Angels, appear in &s;everal Colours: there was <HI>Red Hor&s;es,</HI> noting bloody Judgments, De&s;olations by War, and this by the Mini&s;try of Angels; <HI>Black Hor&s;es,</HI> &s;ignifying the Pe&s;tilence and Famine, and the like Judgments coming upon the World; and <HI>White Hor&s;es,</HI> intimating Victory and Mercy to the Peo|ple of God; and there were <HI>Gri&s;led Hor&s;es,</HI> em|blematically &s;etting forth mixed Di&s;pen&s;ations of Divine Providence: and all by the Mini&s;try of Angels: Of the&s;e the Lord &s;ayes, <HI>They have qui|eted my Spirit in the North Country.</HI> The Angels were &s;ent into the North-Country, namely to <HI>Babylon,</HI> to Execute Judgment there; and then the Holy Spirit of God was &s;atisfied, when He &s;aw, that Ju&s;tice was done by his Angels, on his and his People's Enemies. <HI>David</HI> Prayed that Judgment might be Executed on his Enemies, by the hands of Angels. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 35.5, 6. <HI>Let the Angel of the Lord cha&s;e them, and let the Angel of the Lord Per&s;ecute them.</HI> It is true, that no Judg|ment befa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the World, but God doth it. <HI>Amos</HI> 3.6. <HI>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath</HI>

But much more do they a&s;&s;i&s;t them, that do indeed fear him, when they are called to any &s;ingular Service for his Name. It was from this con&s;ideration, that <HI>Abraham</HI> did encourage his Servant to go on that great Concern, which he was &s;ent to manage, for his Ma&s;ters Family: <HI>The Lord</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>before whom I walk, will &s;end His Angel with thee, and pro&s;per thy way,</HI> Gen. 24.40.

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Holy Angels do perform the Office of Tutors unto God's Children.</HI> Hence they are &s;ometimes in&s;tructed in glorious Truths, by their Mini&s;try, which otherwi&s;e they would not have been ac|quainted with.

Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, and after what manner he will come again to Judge the World, at the la&s;t Day. And we find in the Scriptures, that the Fearers of the Lord have been excited unto and directed in, that which hath been their duty, by the Angels of Heaven. Thus <HI>Manoah</HI> and his Wife, were directed by an Angel, after what manner they &s;hould Educate their Son. Thus when <HI>Elijah</HI> was in a &s;trait, whether to &s;hew him&s;elf to the King or no, <HI>An Angel of the Lord &s;aid to him, go and be not afraid, and he aro&s;e, and went to the King.</HI> 2 King. 1.15. Thus again, an Angel &s;poke to the Apo&s;tles, and bid them go, and Preach the Word of Life in the Temple. <HI>Act</HI> 5.19. It was an Angel that directed <HI>Philip,</HI> to go to the place, where he met with a Great man, whom he in&s;tructed in the Principles of Religion: and by means of that man, was a whole Kingdom Enlightned in the Knowledge of Chri&s;t. The Angels, like faithful Tutors, and Monitors, do &s;ometimes correct and di&s;cipline the Children of God, when they have offended. When <HI>Hagar</HI> Ran-away from her Mi&s;tre&s;s, that dealt hardly with her, an Angel of the Lord &s;aid to her, <HI>Re|turn to thy Mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ubmit thy &s;elf unto her Hands.</HI> Gen. 16.9.

Angels of Heaven, to correct them for &s;ome Sin they have been guilty of.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Holy Angels have a great influence, upon the thoughts, minds, and Spirits of men.</HI> Evil Angels inject evil thoughts into the mind. The Devil put it into the heart of <HI>Judas,</HI> that he &s;hould go, and betray his Ma&s;ter, <HI>Joh.</HI> 13.1. Evil Angels &s;tir up tho&s;e Corruptions, that are in the hearts of men. They have a powerful influence and ope|ration on the Spirits of the Children of di&s;obedi|ence, in whom they work effectually. Hence the Prophet <HI>Micaiah</HI> &s;aw the Lord on his throne, and the ho&s;t of Heaven round about him, and heard him &s;aying, Who &s;hall deceive <HI>Ahab,</HI> that he may go up to Ramoth Gilead, and fall there: and one &s;aid on this manner, and another on that manner: and <HI>there came forth an Evil Spirit,</HI> and &s;aid, I will goe, and be a lying Spirit in the mouth of all his Prophets: and the Lord &s;aid, <HI>Thou &s;halt per&s;wade him, and prevail al&s;o,</HI> 1 Kin. 22.22. By which it appears, that evil Angels have a great influence on the Spirits of wicked men. So have the Holy Angels a great influence on the Spirits of them that fear the Lord, exciting them unto the things that are good. They have the benefit of Angeli|cal Sugge&s;tion, in many good motions, more than them&s;elves are aware of. It is true, that all Holy thoughts are originally from the Spirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Neverthele&s;s, He is plea&s;ed oftentimes to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Mini&s;try of Angels therein.

&s;peaking of a word.

<P N="4">4.

are not wanting to do it. But &s;ometimes it is God's Holy Plea&s;ure to have it otherwi&s;e, they mu&s;t be &s;uffered to fall into great Temptations, for their good, and that God may have Glory thereby.

of it is not, that the Angels of the Lord are not able to prevent the Calamity, or that they are a|ny way invigilant or negligent in that which is their Charge; they always do what God com|mands them, as in the P&s;alm but now, <HI>Ye his An|gels that do His Commandments.</HI> They know, what the Plea&s;ure of God is, and act accordingly.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is po&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch as belong to God, may, (and too often they do) give way to Sin and Temp|tation, and &s;o deprive them&s;elves of the Protection of God, and His Angels.</HI> By Sinning again&s;t God, they provoke him to countermand and &s;u&s;pend the wonted Protection of His Holy Angels.

As he was returning, an old lying Prophet came to him, de&s;iring him to turn in to his hou&s;e, to eat and drink there. No (&s;aith the man of God) I may not do &s;o: for, God hath charged me, that I &s;hould not.

So that it is God, that doth it by their Hand. It is no di&s;honour to God, to make u&s;e of In&s;truments in his Work: and if He &s;ees meet to u&s;e a thou&s;and In&s;truments in

<P>Inference 1. <HI>Hence, although Angelical Appariti|tions are not to be expected in the&s;e days; neverthele&s;s, the Mini&s;try of Holy Angels, doth continue &s;till.</HI> Their <HI>Appearings</HI> are in a great mea&s;ure cea&s;ed, but their <HI>Working</HI> is not cea&s;ed, but continues as in former times. Indeed, there is not need now, as in the Dayes of the Old Te&s;tament, for Angels to ap|pear vi&s;ibly unto men, becau&s;e the Scripture is now perfected, there mu&s;t be no Addition made unto the Written Word of God, which now is &s;ufficient to direct men in all ca&s;es what|&s;oever, that may concern their Salvation and Con&s;olation. There was need for an Angel to appear to <HI>Daniel</HI> vi&s;ibly, to in&s;truct him, concern|ing what &s;hould befal the People of God: and of an Angel to appear to the la&s;t Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> to inform him, what &s;hould befal the Church in all future times. There is no need of that now: we mu&s;t look into what <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>John</HI> have written; and there we may &s;ee, as much as is meet for us to be acquainted with. So that <HI>An|gelical Apparitions</HI> are not frequent in the&s;e Days: Only Evil Angels do appear more often than
<PB N="64" REF="000756_0080_0FAA495F23487C68">
good Ones. No wonder, becau&s;e they are of more Earthly Inclinations, than tho&s;e Spirits, that dwell above. Evil Angels do often appear; very true, and &s;ometimes pretending to be good An|gels too. The Apo&s;tle &s;aith, 2 Cor. 11.14. That <HI>Satan doth tran&s;form him&s;elf into an Angel of Light.</HI> He cometh to men, and appears vi&s;ibly to them, and pretends to be an Angel of Light, and will give them good coun&s;el, will pretend to be for Truth, and for Holine&s;s, although he doth intend nothing le&s;s. I could mention to you in&s;tances re&s;pecting this. There was about four and twen|ty years ago, in a place belonging to the King of <HI>Denmark's</HI> Dominions, a Young man, that a <HI>Dae|mon</HI> appeared to, on a Lord's-day, in white &s;hi|ning Garments, and gave him excellent good coun&s;el, telling him, that he mu&s;t not &s;in, as for|merly he had done; and that he mu&s;t call upon others to amend their ways, to leave their Cur|&s;ing &amp; Swearing, &amp; other Sins; &amp; that he &s;hould pray to God every day three times; &amp; he would joyn with him in &s;inging a P&s;alm too. And yet this <HI>Daemon</HI> did at la&s;t appear to be an Angel of Darkne&s;s. There was in <HI>Geneva,</HI> the Son of a Senator there, that was mi&s;erably impo&s;ed upon, by a <HI>Daemon,</HI> pretending to be a good Angel; that would complain of the Unbelief of &s;ome, who would not (though many did) look upon him as an Angel, that was &s;ent from Heaven. And yet this <HI>Daemon,</HI> that appeared in a glorious manner, was at la&s;t di&s;covered to be an Unclean
<PB N="65" REF="000756_0081_0FAA495FEF34CEF0">
Devil. I do the rather mention the&s;e things, becau&s;e I under&s;tand, that &s;omething of this na|ture hath lately happened in <HI>New-England,</HI> which I am per&s;waded, will in the i&s;&s;ue appear to be a Delu&s;ion of the Evil One, that pretends to he an Angel of Light. Wherefore it is an unwarranta|ble and a very dangerous thing, for men to wi&s;h, that they might &s;ee, and that they might conver&s;e with Angels. I could tell you of &s;ome, that have done &s;o, &amp; God hath been provoked with them for their curio&s;ity and pre&s;umption, and hath permit|ted Devils to come to them, pretending to be good Angels, whereby they have been deceived and undone. But I &s;ay, although Angelical <HI>Ap|paritions</HI> are not to be expected; neverthele&s;s, their Mini&s;try is &s;till continued, and it &s;hall be &s;o: As long as there &s;hall be any Fearers of God upon the Earth, &s;o long &s;hall there be Angels of Hea|ven to Encamp round about them: That Pro|mi&s;e, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 91.11, 12. doth belong unto Believ|ers, even to the End of the World; that God will &s;end his Angels, and give them Charge over them, to keep them in all their ways, and to hold them up in their Arms, that they may not da&s;h them&s;elves again&s;t a &s;tone. Yea, as long as there &s;hall be any of the Elect of God in the World, &s;o long &s;hall there be the continuation of the Mi|ni&s;try of Holy Angels <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.14. <HI>Are they not &s;ent forth to be Mini&s;tring Spirits, to them that &s;hall be Heirs of Salvation?</HI> They then that are Heirs of Salvation, in all Ages of the World, are
<PB N="66" REF="000756_0082_0FAA4962A9EA02D0">
priviledged with this Mini&s;try of the Angels.</P>
<P>Inference 2. <HI>For men to de&s;pi&s;e and abu&s;e them that fear the Lord, mu&s;t needs be an evil and dange|rous thing.</HI> For they have Angels to guard them. The Angels of Heaven are far from de&s;pi&s;ing them. There are no Nur&s;es in the World, that do &s;o tender the Children Educated by them, as the Angels do the meane&s;t Saint on Earth com|mitted to their Care: Saith Chri&s;t, <HI>De&s;pi&s;e not one of my little ones</HI>: De&s;pi&s;e them not, &s;aith He, <HI>For I &s;ay unto you, that in Heaven their Angels do alwayes behold the Face of my Father, that is in Heaven.</HI> Math. 18.10. God gives His Angels a charge to look after them: and what will you de&s;pi&s;e them&punc; Certainly, if the eyes of men were opened, to &s;ee who they are, and what a guard they have, they dur&s;t not de&s;pi&s;e them. As for them that truly Fear God, it may be &s;aid of them, as wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;aid of <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Brethren, <HI>Each one of them re&s;em|bleth the Children of a King.</HI> Thus as to tho&s;e that Fear the Lord, each one of them re&s;embleth a King. There is not a Monarch upon Earth, that hath &s;uch a guard about him, as every one that truly fears God, hath round about him con|tinually. The Souldiers of Heaven do attend him, where ever he goes. If the eyes of wicked men were enlightned (as once the Eyes of the Prophet's Servant) they would not de&s;pi&s;e Holy men. When <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI>'s Servant was &s;ore afraid, be|cau&s;e of Enemies, that were come to apprehend
<PB N="67" REF="000756_0083_0FAA4964492D78D8">
his Ma&s;ter, the Prophet prayed, and &s;aid, <HI>Lord, open his Eyes</HI>: and pre&s;ently he &s;aw the Mountain full of Hor&s;es and Chariots of Fire: his Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e was all &s;urrounded with Angels. Did men &s;ee this, they would not ca&s;t contempt upon tho&s;e that fear God. To abu&s;e them, is a dangerous thing: One of tho&s;e Angels, that they have a whole guard of, is able to de&s;troy all the Ene|mies, that they have in the whole World. It is &s;aid concerning the two Witne&s;&s;es, <HI>That Fire goeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their Enemies: If any one will hurt them, he mu&s;t in this manner be killed.</HI> Rev. 11.5. When they call upon God, he &s;ends <HI>Seraphims,</HI> yea, Hor&s;es and Chariots of fire again&s;t their Enemies. How doth fire go out of their mouths? It alludes to that of <HI>Elijah.</HI> When a crew of wicked men, came to lay hands on him, and &s;aid to him, Come, thou man of God, the King hath &s;ent for thee: He replyed, <HI>If I be a man of God, let fire come down from Heaven, and con&s;ume thee and thy fifty</HI>: and fire came down from Heaven, and immediately de&s;troyed them all. 2 <HI>King.</HI> 1.10, 11. There were Angels at hand, ready to con&s;ume the Prophets Enemies with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. You may ob&s;erve &s;ometimes, that per&s;ons who are full of enmi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and will be &s;pitting their venom, again&s;t one that hath a &s;pecial guard of Angels to attend him, bla&s;ting &s;troaks from Hea|ven fall upon them. The Angels of that Holy man, have heard what hath been &s;poken, &amp; know what has been de&s;igned again&s;t him; and have
<PB N="68" REF="000756_0084_0FAA49646F096990">
taken his part. Take heed then, how you wrong any man, that is dear to God, and to His Holy Angels.</P>
<P>Inference 3. <HI>Hence they that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r God, &s;hould be above the fears of outward evils,</HI> &s;ince they have God and his Angels to take care of them. <HI>If God be for us, who can be again&s;t us?</HI> Saith the Apo&s;tle. So if the Angels of God, are by his appointment for us, we need not fear, though we &s;hould be in as eminent danger, as <HI>David</HI> was in, when among&s;t the Phili&s;tines in <HI>Gath.</HI> Angels are able to defend us, and will do &s;o, &s;o far as a gracious God and Father &s;hall &s;ee it meet for them to do. We have more for us, then are again&s;t us, if we have Angels to be for us, as the Prophet &s;aid unto his Servant, when they were &s;urrounded with enemies: the Servant was afraid; <HI>Alas Ma&s;ter, how &s;hall we do?</HI> &s;aid he: <HI>Fear not,</HI> &s;ays the Prophet, for <HI>there are more with us,</HI> than are with our enemies. And God opened the eyes of the young man, and he &s;aw the mountain was full of Chariots and Hor&s;es of fire, round about <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> 2 King. 6.17. <HI>viz.</HI> An|gels, that did &s;o appear at that time. What tho' men are in danger; if they have a &s;trong convoy, they do not fear. This is the ca&s;e of Gods Children, whil&s;t in this World: they are in danger; they are like men at Sea, &amp; in the mid&s;t of enemies: the Pirates of Hell are &s;eeking to lay hands on them: But they have a &s;trong convoy; they have Angels of Heaven to be a guard unto them: &amp; therefore need not be afraid of what their Enemies can do
<PB N="69" REF="000756_0085_0FAA49655D992218">
unto them. They that fear the Lord, may be above the fear of danger, when they go to Sea; only let them look to their call; let them look to it, that they are in Gods way; then He will &s;end his Angels to look after them. So in great and hazardous Journies by land, they need not fear, but they &s;hall go forth; and return in &s;afety: If it be good for them to be pre&s;erved and protected, it &s;hall be &s;o, notwith&s;tanding what ever evils may attend them in their way. Angels are more able to defend them, than all their enemies are able any way to hurt them. It was &s;aid concerning the Egyptians, I&s;a. 31-3. <HI>They are Fle&s;h and not Spirit</HI>; they are poor weak Creatures. But now the Angels are Spirit and not Fle&s;h: why then &s;hould they that fear God, be afraid of what their enemies can do unto them, who are fle&s;h, and not &s;pirit, when they have tho&s;e to be their Guardians and deliver|ers, that are &s;pirit and not fle&s;h? And they need not fear &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;ea&s;es; God will &s;end his Angel to deliver them, if pre&s;ervation from &s;uch a di&s;temper &s;hall be be&s;t for them. P&s;al. 91.10. <HI>There &s;hall no evil befall thee, neither &s;hall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.</HI> How &s;o? It follows in the next ver&s;e, <HI>for he &s;hall give His Angels charge over thee.</HI> So he doth wonderfully &s;ometimes. I remember a Lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned man relates a remarkable Providence to this purpo&s;e, of the Chancellour of <HI>Navar,</HI> that heard a voice in the night, calling him by his name, and bidding him go out of that Town, becau&s;e within a few dayes a terrible Plague would be
<PB N="70" REF="000756_0086_0FAA496654D60F88">
there, and make the Town de&s;olate: He took the warning, and &s;o e&s;caped the danger. God hath &s;trange wayes, by his Angels to deliver his Servants in times of &s;ickne&s;s and common danger, when it &s;hall be mo&s;t for his glory. And they need not fear, what evil Angels can do unto them. The Lord for holy ends may &s;uffer you to fall into the hands of tho&s;e cruel Creatures: but if you fear God, there are Holy Angels by, that will not for&s;ake you&punc; that will inable you to endure, whatever God &s;hall &s;ee mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, to &s;uffer you to be tempted and afflicted with. And therefore be not afraid: only fear God, and tru&s;t in Him. And then, &s;uppo&s;e the wor&s;t that can be &s;uppo&s;ed; &s;uppo&s;e the Lord &s;hould give leave to tho&s;e enemies to kill your bo|dies; &s;uch a thing may, and &s;ometimes has happen|ed to the dear Servants of God: neverthele&s;s, their Souls are &s;afe, as being in the hands of Holy An|gels. The Lord will &s;ay to his Angels, You Angels of mine, go and look after &s;uch a man, or woman, I commit to you the care and charge of their Im|mortal Souls, to bring them &s;afe to Heaven, after they have &s;uffered, what is my plea&s;ure to have them indure. That the fearers of the Lord may and ought to be above the fear of outward evils, from the con&s;ideration of the Mini&s;try and Guard|ian&s;hip of the Holy Angels, is evident from &s;everal things; which we may take notice of &amp; con&s;ider.

Object of Faith: We may not pray unto any one, but unto him that is Omnipre&s;ent and Om|nipotent, unto him that hath power to do for us whatever we can de&s;ire of him.

We need Sanctifying Grace: and who can give us Grace, but God alone? As for the Angel that <HI>Jacob</HI> did pray unto, he was not a Created Angel, but the Son of God, who is called an Angel in re&s;pect of his Office, as being &s;ent by God. Therefore <HI>Jacob</HI> called the name of the place, where he wre&s;tled with the Angel, <HI>Peniel,</HI> Gen. 32.30. which &s;ignifies, <HI>The Face of God,</HI> for (&s;aith he) <HI>I have &s;een God.</HI> The Angel he pray|ed unto, was God; &s;o the Prophet <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> declares, Ho&s;. 12.4, 5. <HI>He had power over the Angel, even the Lord of Ho&s;ts, that is his Memorial.</HI> That An|gel is called by the name of <HI>Jehovah</HI>; and that glorious Title, <HI>Of the Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> is attributed unto him.

Three or four particulars evincing and confirming the Truth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this <HI>Inference,</HI> may be here mentioned.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Until &s;uch time as men fear God, they cann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> know, that the Angels are concerned for them.</HI> It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> true, that God chargeth his Angels with his E|lect before they fear him: but they cannot know this, and therefore cannot have the comfort of it, before they turn to the Lord&punc; A man cannot know his Election before his Conversion.

<PB N="83" REF="000756_0099_0FAA49742A6F1D08">
know, that the Angels have a charge given to them concerning him. For, if God had not from all Eternity intended that man's Salvation, he would never have put his fear into his heart. So that when once Grace is wrought in his Soul, he may be &s;ure, that the Angel of the Lord Encam|peth round about him: But before that, he can|not have the comfort of this Truth.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is certain, that the Angels do not delight in tho&s;e that fear not God.</HI> They don't care to be in their Company. As God him&s;elf delights not in them; <HI>By Nature we were the Children of Wrath</HI>: they that are &s;till in their Nature, in their natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nconverted State, are Children of Wrath; The Wrath of God abides on them that believe not: He is angry with the wicked every day. And as an holy man cannot delight in the company, and conver&s;ation of tho&s;e that are ungodly: <HI>Da|vid</HI> &s;aith, <HI>All my delight is with the Saints on Earth:</HI> and again, <HI>I am a Companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy Precepts.</HI> So mu&s;t it be concluded concerning Holy Angels, that they delight not in communion with &s;uch as do not fear God. If holy men cannot do it, Angels who are holier than they, can never do it. It is a very offen&s;ive thing to an holy man, to &s;ee o|thers do things that are incon&s;i&s;tent with the fear of God, to hear them &s;peak &s;uch words, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them do &s;uch deeds, as cannot well &s;tand with the true Fear of God. It is a grief and vexation to him, that has a righteous Soul within him, as

it was to <HI>Lot.</HI> Much more then are the Holy Angels offended thereat: <HI>Doves</HI> can't endure to be where there is an ill &s;cent; you know it drives them away. So when men indulge them&s;elves in the wayes of Sin, the Angels, tho&s;e Doves of Heaven, fly away and can't endure their compa|ny.

<P>THere were in the Primitive Times (as there are in the&s;e days) men, who altho' they did call them&s;elves Chri|&s;tians, had apo&s;tatized from the great Truths of the Go&s;pel, imbracing Fundamental Errors in Religion. The Apo&s;tle in the begin|ning of this Chapter, &s;hews, that &s;uch cannot E&s;|cape the De&s;troying Judgments of Heaven, which would unavoidably come upon them. And this he proves by an Argument taken from the Ex|ample
<PB N="105" REF="000756_0121_0FAA47F05C0D4E10">
of what had befallen other Sinners. There are three exceeding awful In&s;tances here menti|oned. The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> is that of <HI>the Sinning Angels.</HI> The <HI>Second</HI> is that, which befel the Apo&s;tate Old World: Notwith&s;tanding, there was a World of them, (the Lord knows how many Thou&s;ands, how many Millions there might be) neverthele&s;s they were all de&s;troyed, excepting one &s;mall Fa|mily. The <HI>Third Instance,</HI> is, that <HI>Of Sodom and Gomorrah,</HI> and tho&s;e Citie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that were Condemned by an Eternal Overthrow. When they &s;inned again&s;t God, he puni&s;ht them with the Venge|ance of Eternal Fire. The words at pre&s;ent be|fore us, fall under the fir&s;t of the&s;e Examples, namely, that <HI>Of the Angels which &s;inned.</HI> I have &s;poken many things to you concerning the Holy Angels, who never &s;inned again&s;t God. It may not be un&s;uitable to di&s;cour&s;e &s;omething concer|ning the <HI>Reprobate Angels,</HI> who have &s;inned, and are damned for it. When it is &s;aid, <HI>God &s;pared them not,</HI> the meaning is, that he did &s;hew them no mercy; that he made them become the Sub|jects of his Wrathful Judgments; that he did not forgive their &s;in, nor did ever make an offer of mercy to them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> therefore to be in&s;i&s;ted on, is,
<HI>That the Holy God hath made the Angels which &s;in|ned, Examples of Judgment without mercy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="000756_0122_0FAA47F064563F00">This <HI>Doctrine</HI> may be cleared in &s;everal <HI>Pro|po&s;itions.</HI></P>
<P>PROPOSITION I. <HI>That although all the An|gels were in their fir&s;t Creation without &s;in, neverthe|le&s;s, many of them did &s;oon after that, Sin again&s;t the Great God their Glorious Creator.</HI></P>
<P>There are divers things contained in this <HI>Pro|position.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That all the Angels were once without Sin.</HI> As for the Angels that &s;inned, there was a time&punc; when <HI>They were in the Truth,</HI> as it is &s;aid of them, <HI>Job.</HI> 8.44. Their Fir&s;t E&s;tate was a State of In|tegrity. They were once adorned with the Glo|rious Image of God: and on that account they were <HI>The Sons of God,</HI> Job 38.7. the Sons of God, in re&s;pect of their being like unto him, and made after his Image in their Fir&s;t E&s;tate. They did not come &s;inful out of Gods Hands: that could not po&s;&s;ibly be, for then God &s;hould be the Author of Sin, which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould, as the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> proves. <HI>God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man: Every good and perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no variablene&s;s nor &s;hadow of turning.</HI> Jam. 1.13, 17. All good is from God, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle: and therefore evil, moral evil, &s;in, cannot be from him; for then he &s;hould be variable and &s;ubject to change, as Creatures are, which the Ble&s;&s;ed God is not: and therefore He is not the Author
<PB N="107" REF="000756_0123_0FAA47F138FF7228">
of &s;in. The Angels then that &s;inned, were pure and &s;potle&s;s, as they came out of His Hands: Tho&s;e very Angels, which are now in Hell, were once in Heaven. Hence it is &s;aid, <HI>That they left their own Habitation.</HI> Jude 6. Heaven was their proper place and habitation, their Native Coun|trey, as we may &s;o &s;peak. Tho&s;e Apo&s;tate An|gels who are now bla&s;pheming in Hell, there was a time, when they were prai&s;ing God in Heaven. When the Foundation of the Earth was laid, <HI>All the Sons of God &s;ang and &s;houted for joy</HI>: all the Angels; tho&s;e that are now Bla&s;phe|mers of him, were then &s;houting for joy, in ad|miration at the Wi&s;dom and Power of their Cre|ator, whom they did then behold laying the foun|dation of this Earth. Tho&s;e Angels that are now <HI>evil,</HI> were once <HI>good,</HI> and they continued to be &s;o for a few dayes. For on the &s;ixth day <HI>God &s;aw every thing that He had made, and behold it was very good.</HI> Gen. 1.31. If all the Works that God had made, were good on the &s;ixth day after the Creation began, the Angels that have &s;inned, were then good.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Rebrobate Angels did not continue in their Sinle&s;s &s;tate, for any long time.</HI> For, although they were mo&s;t excellent and glorious Creatures, yet they were but Creatures; and being Creatures, they were <HI>Mutable,</HI> and becau&s;e mutable, there|fore <HI>Peccable,</HI> that is, in a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;inning and falling from God. Ab&s;olute immutability is a Divine Property: it cannot be affirmed of any,
<PB N="108" REF="000756_0124_0FAA47F1F6179090">
but God alone. Mal. 3.6. <HI>I am the Lord, I change not.</HI> It cannot be &s;aid of any be&s;ides the Lord, that he cannot change. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> gave a judicious An&s;wer to that enquiry, <HI>How could Angels, that were &s;uch excellent and glorious Creatures in their fir&s;t estate, not having any one to tempt them as man had, how could they &s;in, and loo&s;e their happine&s;s</HI>? His An|&s;wer was, <HI>Non &s;unt Deus,</HI> They are not God: and&punc; therefore were &s;ubject unto change, and in a po&s;|&s;ibility of falling from Heaven. <HI>He chargeth his Angels with folly,</HI> Job 4.18. The Angels are char|gable with folly in this re&s;pect. It is a Scripture Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Wi&s;e as an Angel of God.</HI> Neverthele&s;s&punc; the wi&s;e Angels are and alwayes were the Subjects of <HI>a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mparative folly</HI>: compared with the only wi&s;e God, they are fooli&s;h things. And when once they &s;inned, they were to be charged with infinite folly. For them to offend and fall out with their Omnipotent Creator, and by loo&s;ing his favour to loo&s;e their own happine&s;s, was &s;tu|pendous folly in the fallen Angels. As for the particular &s;in, which the Apo&s;tate Angels were guilty o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the Scripture is not &s;o clear in revealing what it was; and therefore it is not for us to be po&s;itive in the determination of it. Neverthele&s;s, it is very probable, that God might try their O|bedience unto the Moral Law, by &s;ome po&s;itive Precept o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> other. As he tryed mans Obedience by that po&s;itive Precept re&s;pecting the forbidden fruit on the Tree of knowledge of good &amp; evil: &s;o we may conceive, that he tryed the Obedience
<PB N="109" REF="000756_0125_0FAA47F2A70C71D8">
of the Angels, by &s;ome po&s;itive Precept. It is al&s;o a probable conjecture, that the Lord told them (and Commanded them) that they &s;hould all be Mini&s;tring Spirits for man, and that this they would not &s;toop unto, man being far their inferi|our. To be &s;ure there was pride in the &s;in which the Angels became guilty of, as indeed there is in every &s;in. Hence it is &s;aid, that a <HI>Bi&s;hop mu&s;t n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t be a novice, le&s;t being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the Devil.</HI> 1 Tim. 3.6. The Devil was condemned to eternal fire, becau&s;e of the &s;in of pride. But how, and in what particular that pride di&s;covered it &s;elf, the Scripture hath not declared unto us. This notwith&s;tanding &s;e|veral things are certain from the Scripture. It is certain, that the Angels, &s;ome of them, did &s;in a|gain&s;t God: So the Apo&s;tle expre&s;ly declares here. And by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Jude,</HI> it is &s;aid, that they <HI>kept not their fir&s;t e&s;tate, but left their own habitation.</HI> And hence the Scripture &s;peaks not only concern|ing <HI>Good Angels,</HI> but concerning <HI>Evil Spirits.</HI> We read in the Go&s;pel of certain Women, who had been healed of <HI>Evil Spirits</HI> and infirmities. Tho&s;e Spirits had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them and made them &s;ick. In particular and by name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here was <HI>Mary Magda|len,</HI> out of whom went &s;even <HI>Devils.</HI> Luke. 8.2. So that there are Angels, who are called <HI>Evil Spirits</HI> and <HI>Devils.</HI> We find in the Scripture, that Chri&s;t gave his di&s;ciples <HI>power again&s;t unclean Spirits.</HI> Mat. 10.1. They are &s;aid to be unclean Spirits, not only (though partly on that account) becau&s;e they
<PB N="110" REF="000756_0126_0FAA47F36D11A0D0">
excite wretched men unto unclean lu&s;ts, but be|cau&s;e they them&s;elves are defiled with &s;in. They are polluted, and have made them&s;elves hateful &amp; abominable in the &s;ight of the holy God, again&s;t whom they have &s;inned. And it is moreover certain, that the&s;e Apo&s;tate Angels did early cor|rupt them&s;elves. It was within a &s;hort time after the world began. <HI>John</HI> tells us, that <HI>the Devil &s;inned from the beginning,</HI> 1 Joh. 3.8. And our Saviour Chri&s;t hath told us, that <HI>the Devil is a Lyar and a Murderer from the beginning</HI>&punc; Joh. 8 44. That is to &s;ay, from the fir&s;t beginning of the World, or within a &s;hort time after the Creation. The <HI>Jewi&s;h Doctors</HI> (many of them) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave Conjectured that the fallen Angels &s;inned on <HI>the &s;econd day</HI> after the Creation began; and they &s;uppo&s;e that to be the rea&s;on why there is no divine approbation men|tioned concerning the work of that day, as there is of the other. But there is no &s;olidity in that conjecture. For what is &s;poken <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.10. relates to the work of the &s;econd, and not of the third day only. It &s;eems clear from the Scripture, that there was no &s;in in the world for &s;ix dayes after the beginning. <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.31. Neverthele&s;s, It is evi|dent, that the Angels fell before man did, for it was the Devil, that did tempt man to di&s;obey the Commandment of God, which could not have been, if he had not him&s;elf &s;inned again&s;t God before that. It is yet further clear and evident from the Scripture, that more then a few of the Angels &s;inned. There were vast multitudes of
<PB N="111" REF="000756_0127_0FAA47F62CC21970">
them that fell down from Heaven to Hell. No doubt but one was the Ringleader in that rebellion, whom the Scripture calls by the name of, <HI>the De|vil,</HI> and by the name of <HI>Satan,</HI> and whom the Jews were wont by way of contempt to call by the name of <HI>Belzebub</HI>: That <HI>Lucifer,</HI> (as he u&s;eth though not &s;o properly to be called) who is be|come the Monarch of Hell, did not fall alone, nor peri&s;h alone in his iniquity, there were migh|ty numbers of them that did joyn with the great Devil, in the con&s;piracy again&s;t the mo&s;t High. Hence the Scripture &s;peaks of <HI>the Devil and His Angels,</HI> Mat. 25.41. <HI>His Angels.</HI> So that there were many of them, that were concerned in that fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and Rebellion again&s;t the Lord. It is &s;aid, Ephe&s;. 2.3. That the Devil is <HI>the Prince of the Power of the Air.</HI> So that there is a <HI>Power,</HI> an <HI>Ho&s;t,</HI> a va&s;t <HI>Army</HI> of tho&s;e Evil Spirits, that did joyn with the Devil, in &s;etting them&s;elves again&s;t the Great God. How many, is not for us to &s;ay, the Written Word of God not &s;peaking any thing as to the quantity of their number: only it is manife&s;t from the Scripture, that there are far more Angels that have &s;inned, far more Devils then there are men in all the World. There is not a man in the whole world, but there are Devils to tempt him continually. And if &s;o, they mu&s;t needs be more in number than men are. We read in the Go&s;pel of no le&s;s than a Legion of Devils in one poor mi&s;era|ble man. Luk. 8.30. You read there of a po&s;&s;e&s;|ed
<PB N="112" REF="000756_0128_0FAA47F72E5B0508">
man, and Chri&s;t demanded of the Evil Spirit, what his name was: The chief Devil among them made an&s;wer, <HI>It is Legion, for we are many.</HI> A Legion is &s;ix thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty &s;ix. Now then, if the Devil has &s;uch va&s;t num|bers of Infernal Spirits under him; if he has &s;uch troops of them, as that he can &s;pare no le&s;s than a Legion to afflict, and as it were to keep Garri|&s;on in one poor mi&s;erable man: what prodigious numbers of Evil Angels mu&s;t there needs be.</P>
<P>Thus you have &s;een the <HI>fir&s;t Propo&s;ition</HI> confirm|ed? We proceed to the <HI>Second.</HI></P>
<P>PROPOSITION. II. <HI>That God hath made the Sinning Angels examples of Judgment without Mercy.</HI> Therefore it is here &s;aid, <HI>God &s;pared them not.</HI> He never did make any one tender of Mercy to them. He did not pardon their offence, nor ever will do. The truth of this is evident from &s;everal things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In that the fallen Angels are for the pre&s;ent i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a mi&s;erable condition.</HI> They are now at this in&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery. They have lo&s;t their happi|ne&s;s for ever, and did &s;o, from the very moment, when they fir&s;t &s;inned again&s;t God; they were immediately excluded out of Heaven, and the e|verla&s;ting Gates were &s;hut upon them. I do not &s;ay, nor do I believe, that the Angels did &s;in in the highe&s;t Heaven: for it is &s;aid of that Hea|ven, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.4. That it is <HI>Undefiled</HI>: whereas if the Angels had &s;inned there, they would have defiled the very Heavens. But when once they &s;inned&punc; they were bani&s;hed from Heaven, and they never

came within the Palace of the great King any more. As &s;oon as ever they &s;inned, they were ca&s;t away from the Pre&s;ence of God for ever; and they are Excommunicated from the Society of tho&s;e Holy Angels, that once they had an happy Fellow&s;hip with. And they are not only bani&s;hed out of the Heavenly Kingdom to Eternity, being confined to the low Regions of the World; but they are m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reover become the Subjects of po&s;itive mi&s;ery: Therefore are they &s;aid to be <HI>in Darkne&s;s,</HI> which notes mi&s;ery, as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it in this Context, they are <HI>de|livered into Darkne&s;s.</HI> Darkne&s;s of mi&s;ery is come upon them already, they being excluded from the Pre&s;ence of God, in who&s;e favour is light and life: they mu&s;t needs be in darkne&s;s. And they are &s;aid to be made <HI>Pri&s;oners,</HI> and to be <HI>Ca&s;t into Hell,</HI> and to be <HI>in Chains</HI> there: <HI>They are delivered into Chains of Darkne&s;s.</HI> Tho&s;e expre&s;&s;i|ons are <HI>Metaphorical,</HI> alluding to what is cu&s;toma|ry among men. A Malefactor who is a great Criminal, is committed to Pri&s;on, and is there to lye in Chains, until the <HI>Se&s;&s;ions</HI> comes. So hath the Great God dealt by the Angels that &s;inned again&s;t Him, He hath committed them to Pri|&s;on, and hath ordered them to lye in Chains there, until the Judgment of the Great Day &s;hall come. They are not only under a Chain in re|&s;pect of the re&s;training Power and Providence of God, which does hamper the Evil Angels, that they cannot go where they would, nor can they
<PB N="114" REF="000756_0130_0FAA47F8DDCDCA90">
do many things, that fain they would do, which is a torment to them. But there is the chain of a guilty Con&s;cience, which is a dark chain in|deed, in re&s;pect whereof the Devils carry Hell up and down the World with them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Angels that &s;inned, &s;hall ere long be in grea|ter mi&s;ery then at pre&s;ent they are &s;ubject unto.</HI> They are Pri&s;oners, and have been &s;o from the day of their fall: neverthele&s;s, they are Pri&s;oners at large, and the Devil hath a long chain allowed to him for the pre&s;ent: Therefore when it was &s;aid to him, <HI>Whence come&s;t thou?</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>I come from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</HI> Job 1.7. So that he hath leave to go from one end of the earth to the other. <HI>He walks about &s;eeking whom he may devour,</HI> 1 Pet. 5.8. For the pre&s;ent he is permitted to range up and down the World, to &s;ee if he can prevail over mi&s;erable Creatures, and make a prey of the precious Souls of the children of men. But there is a day a coming, when he &s;hall be made a <HI>clo&s;e Pri&s;oner.</HI> Satan is to be ca&s;t into the Bot|tomle&s;s Pit, and &s;hut up there. <HI>Rev.</HI> 20.4. He cannot then wander up and down as now he doth. Although the Devils now feel &s;omething of torment in their guilty Con&s;ciences, and there are doubtle&s;s &s;ome Laws which they are under, being (as &s;ome have judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erved) awed by a &s;uperiour power, and which they are as much afraid of acting again&s;t, as a Malefactor is afraid of going again&s;t the Laws of men, le&s;t h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="115" REF="000756_0131_0FAA47F97B76CF10">
&s;hould be &s;courged for his &s;o doing: Hence the Devil, though he had a natural power to hurt <HI>Job,</HI> was afraid to do it without leave. Yet there is a time coming, that they will be in more in|tolerable torment by far, than what they at pre|&s;ent indure. Hence when the Devils &s;aw the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t approaching, they cryed out, What have we to do with thee? <HI>Art thou come to torment us before the time.</HI> Mat. 8.28. So that there is a time yet to come, wherein the Devils &s;hall be &s;ubject unto greater torment, than as yet they are made &s;en&s;ible of. And that time will be at the Day of Judgment: <HI>Do ye not know, that the Saints &s;hall Judge the World?

Therefore it is, that the thought of the Day of Judgment is exceeding terrible unto all the Devils in Hell; they all tremble, when ever they think of the Judgment to come. <HI>The Devils believe, that there is one God, and they tremble.</HI> Jam. 1.19. So they believe, that there is a Day of Judgment, that will be here ere long, and they tremble at the fore thought of it. We read in the Go&s;pel of a Devil in a po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed man, who &s;aid to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</HI> q. d.

<P N="3">3. <HI>The ruine of the Angels that &s;inned is irrecovera|ble and eternal.</HI> Therefore is it &s;aid, that <HI>God hath not &s;pared them,</HI> becau&s;e they are without all hopes of ever being re&s;tored to their ble&s;&s;ed State.

But Oh! the Holine&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ed God, that when the reprobate Angels did once become Lyars, they might not dwell in Gods hou&s;e, nor tarry in his &s;ight one moment longer. Such is his Holine&s;s, that he cannot look upon &s;in with approbation of it. Hab. 1.13. <HI>He is of purer eyes, than to behold evil: he cannot look upon iniquity</HI> without dete&s;tation there|of. 'Tis not only true that he will not, but that he cannot. God can no more approve of &s;in, then he can cea&s;e to be God. Thus glorious is he in Holine&s;s And we &s;ee before our eyes a glo|rious and dreadful demon&s;tration of the Ju&s;tice of God, in that he does puni&s;h &s;inners whoever they be. The truth is, He never &s;pared any &s;in, there was never any &s;in committed in the World, nor
<PB N="124" REF="000756_0140_0FAA480AA10F39F0">
never &s;hall be, but God hath puni&s;hed it, or will puni&s;h it. As for the Angels that &s;inned, they are condemned to eternal fire and flames: not any one of them all can e&s;cape the &s;troke of Divine Ju&s;tice. And as for reprobate men, although God bears with them a long time, and is plea&s;ed to ex|erci&s;e infinite Patience towards them, yet they will at la&s;t find, that all their &s;ins &s;hall be puni&s;h|ed with a Vengeance, Rom. 9.22. <HI>What, if God willing to &s;hew his wrath, and make his power known, endured with much long &s;uffering the Ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted to de&s;truction.</HI> At la&s;t Gods wrath, his Ju&s;tice will be made to appear in puni&s;hing them for all their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, Ay, and he will make known his infinite Power at the &s;ame time.

That a poor Creature &s;hould be filled with the wrath of God, and yet be capable, or in a po&s;&s;ibility, to indure it to all eternity, this makes known his power as well as his wrath. Thus doth he &s;hew his wrath and make his Power known. And as for the Elect of God, he hath not &s;pared their &s;ins, as appears in that his own Son was not &s;pared, when he became a &s;urety on their behalf, Rom. 8.32. <HI>God &s;pared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.</HI> The Son of God who never &s;inned nor could &s;in, yet was not &s;pared, when he became a Mediator undertaking to an&s;wer for &s;inners. That is the highe&s;t demon|&s;tration of the Holine&s;s and Ju&s;tice of God, that
<PB N="125" REF="000756_0141_0FAA480B83DA4460">

<P>Inference. 3. <HI>Sin makes men to become like unto the Apo&s;tate Angels.</HI> It turns men into Devils. There are wicked men who are Devils incarnate.

He is called their Father, Joh. 8.44. <HI>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the lu&s;ts of your Father ye will do,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t: Ye do ju&s;t as the Devil doth, and ju&s;t as the Devil would have you do, and there|fore ye are his Children, and he is your father. There are Children in re&s;pect of <HI>Imitation</HI>: Sinners imitate the Devil: Yea, they have his Image, the very &s;ame evil nature, the &s;ame wicked di&s;po|&s;ition and &s;inful inclinations which are in the heart of the Devil, are in their hearts and na|tures.

E&s;pecially, there are &s;ome &s;ins that make men exceeding like the Devil, and his Children indeed. As now, that &s;in of <HI>Apo&s;tacy</HI> from good beginnings: The Devil was the fir&s;t Apo&s;tate. Hence when men have begun to do well, and after that turn from the good ways of God, they make them&s;elves like the Devil. As for the Fal|len Angels, they have left off all Exerci&s;es of Re|ligion and Piety. There was a time, when the Devil and his Evil Angels did pray and wor&s;hip God; when they did joyn with the Holy Angels in prai&s;ing the great Creator of the World. But they have left praying and prai&s;ing, and for&s;aken the Company of Holy Angels. Ah! Lord God, are there not &s;uch in this A&s;&s;embly this day! are there not &s;uch here before the Lord this day, who have manife&s;ted them&s;elves to be the Devils Children? There was a time when they would pray, and joyn with others the Fearers of the Lord in &s;erving him: but they have for&s;aken him, they &s;erve him not, neither do they pray unto him: And they have for&s;aken the Commu|nion of tho&s;e Fearers of the Lord with whom they did once joyn in Religious Exerci&s;es. This is to be and to do ju&s;t like the Devils: &s;uch are his Children, as like him as it is po&s;&s;ible for Crea|tures to be out of Hell: So <HI>Hypocrites</HI> and Di&s;&s;em|blers are like the &s;inful Angels.

Such men there are in the world, as will out of re&s;pect to carnal ends and de&s;igns make pretenti|ons to Religion: They are like the Devil.

Sect. 8. has mentioned &s;ome of them. The Re|lations publi&s;hed by <HI>Gregorius Magnus</HI> concerning the Apparitions of Angels to Saints in tho&s;e times, were either fabulous or &s;atanical illu&s;ions.

Yet, he does acknowledge that &s;ome may have that which he never did nor de&s;ired to ex|perience. <HI>Sint dona &s;ed quae ego nec curo nec de&s;ide|ro,</HI> &s;ays he.

per&s;on was reputed a very good Woman, &amp; that he believed there was no fraud at all in the mat|ter. This Apparition then mu&s;t needs be either of a good or of an evil Angel. I &s;ee no rea&s;on to a&s;cribe it to the latter. To proceed. <HI>Amyraldus</HI> relates a remarkable pa&s;&s;age concerning the Chan|celler of <HI>Navar,</HI> which he had from <HI>Cameron,</HI> who received it from the Chancellers own mouth. He being in a Town belonging to <HI>Bern,</HI> one night as he was a &s;leep, heard a voice calling him by his name <HI>Calignon,</HI> whereupon awaking, he &s;oon fell a&s;leep again: a little while after, he heard the &s;ame voice, calling to him a &s;econd time, which made a greater impre&s;&s;ion on him, yet fell a&s;leep again. The voice awakened him the third time, then advi&s;ing him to retire &s;peedily out of the Town, &s;aying, that within a few days the Plague would be there and rage dreadfully: He follow|ed the advice given him, whereby him&s;elf and Family were delivered; for within few dayes the Plague began, and a great part of the Town was &s;wept away thereby: <HI>Amyrald</HI> concludes that this voce was from a good Angel.

<HI>viz.</HI> that it was <HI>the voice of Angels, Prai&s;ing God in a gentle Harmony.</HI> I have el&s;e-where (in my <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> about <HI>the Prevalency of Prayer,</HI> p. 16, 17.) mentioned a memorable pa&s;&s;age concerning Mr. <HI>Patrick Simp&s;on,</HI> an Eminent Mini&s;ter at <HI>Sterling</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> unto whom, after he had &s;pent a day alone in Prayer with Fa&s;ting, Angels came, and gave him an an&s;wer concerning the thing which he had all the day been praying about, of which he never &s;poke one word to any one, excepting only to one per&s;on, who hapned to over-hear &s;omething, whom he &s;olemnly obte&s;ted, not to &s;ay ought of it, until after his Death, thus ex|pre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, <HI>What am I du&s;t and a&s;hes, that the Holy Ministring Spirits &s;hould be &s;ent by the Lord to deliver a Me&s;&s;age to me.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e things con&s;idered, I conclude, that it is not impo&s;&s;ible, but that Holy Angels may ap|pear to &s;ome per&s;ons.

<P>Conclu&s;ion II. <HI>Some Circum&s;tances attending ex|traordinary Apparitions pretended to be Angelical, have demon&s;trated them to be Diabolical, others have ren|dred them ju&s;tly &s;u&s;picious.</HI> Let the Appearing Spi|rits

pretend never &s;o much to be good Angels; if they &s;ugge&s;t any thing which is contrary to right rea&s;on, or the light of nature, they are cer|tainly Devils. Hence <HI>Mahomet's</HI> Angel, from whom he pretended to receive his new Religion was a Devil: For in the <HI>Alcoron</HI> there are contra|dictions, and therefore fal&s;hoods which cannot proceed from a good Spirit: No good Angel e|ver told a lye. Hence that Spirit which &s;hall be once found in a Lye, comes not from Heaven. If he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ay, &s;uch a thing &s;hall happen, which yet does not come to pa&s;s at the time prefixed, or that he will do or not do &s;uch a thing, and yet &s;hall act contrary, or &s;hall in any thing fal&s;ify, to be &s;ure that is no good Angel. Or, if it does per&s;wade to any di&s;hone&s;t thing, it is an Evil Spirit. By this it was manife&s;t, that the Spirits which Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> and <HI>Killet</HI> were &s;o familiar with, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be good Angels, were unclean Devils: for although tho&s;e Spirits did for a long time pretend to great Sanctity, they did at la&s;t advi&s;e to filthy <HI>Nicolaiti&s;m.</HI> Or, if the &s;eeming Angels &s;hall endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h any notions in Religion not grounded on the Scripture, they are not from Heaven. This &s;heweth, that the Apparitions &s;o frequent and &s;o much boa&s;ted of among&s;t the Papi&s;ts, were in truth Diabolical Il|lu&s;ions: For the de&s;ign of them was to confirm the notion of Purgatory, the wor&s;hiping of Ima|ges, praying for the Dead, and &s;uch like Doct|rines, which the Scripture condemns: Spirits pre|tending
<PB N="15" REF="000756_0163_0FAA4825C28BBFA8">
to be Angels, made way for the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Idolatries, by exhorting men unto a &s;inful venera|tion of the Cro&s;s, the Relicks of Martyrs, and the like Super&s;titions. Or, if they &s;hall &s;peak a|ny thing which is not grave and weighty, it is ea&s;y to judge what Spirits they are. It is beneath the maje&s;ty of an Angel to &s;peak or do any thing which is trivial, mean, or little. Or, if they &s;hall interrupt or divert the per&s;ons unto whom they appear, from a due attendance to the Publick Wor|&s;hip of God: Such things as the&s;e are infallible demon&s;trations, that the Appearing Angels are E|vil Ones. There are other things which render the ca&s;e very &s;u&s;picious: To in&s;tance. If the Apparitions are frequent, and the Spirits that come&punc; u&s;e familiar conver&s;e, it is much to be fea|red, that they are not from Heaven, but from Hell. For if we &s;earch the Scriptures, we &s;hall find, that when Holy Angels appeared, they &s;oon delivered the Me&s;&s;age which they were &s;ent a|bout, and then di&s;appeared, and came no more. The &s;ame Angel &s;eldome came more than two or three times (mo&s;t commonly but once) to the &s;ame per&s;on. Twice did the Angel appear to <HI>Manoah's</HI> Wife, <HI>but the Angel of the Lord did no more appear to</HI> Manoah, <HI>and to his Wife.</HI> Judg. 13.21. When therefore Angels &s;hall be daily Vi&s;itants&punc; and continue &s;o to be from one week, and from one month to another, the per&s;ons concerned have ju&s;t cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect, that they are impo&s;ed on by deceitful <HI>Daemons,</HI> pretending to be Angels of
<PB N="16" REF="000756_0164_0FAA4826666744B0">
light. Where is there an in&s;tance in all the Bible of a good Angel that became a Familiar to any man or wo|man? Again, if what the Spirits reveal, does admit of a double &amp; doubtful interpretation, it is a &s;ign, that they are Spirits of the &s;ame nature with tho&s;e that &s;poke in the Oracle at <HI>Delphos</HI> of old This among&s;t other things gave ju&s;t ground to &s;u&s;pect, that the pious young Woman <HI>Chri&s;tina Poniatovia</HI> (of whom we &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak more afterwards) was deluded by Satan, when &s;he thought her &s;elf favoured with Angelical and Divine Revelations. The Spirit told her, that King <HI>F.</HI> &s;hould be exalted, and <HI>F.</HI> be made low. But he would not tell, who was meant by <HI>F.</HI> whether King <HI>Frederic</HI> or <HI>Ferdinand.</HI> What was this better then, <HI>Ajo te Aeacidae Romanos vincere po&s;se?</HI> or then, <HI>Ibis, redibis, nunquam, per bella peribis.</HI> Good Angels do not hide them&s;elves in the dark under ambiguities, but declare their me&s;&s;ages clearly. If therefore the Spirits that appear under the notion of Angels from Heaven, &s;hall leave tho&s;e that de|&s;ire a Re&s;olution of their doubts from them, ju&s;t as wi&s;e as they found them, it is much to be doubted that they are deceiving Spirits. Again, <HI>Ec&s;ta&s;ies</HI> attended with abreptions of mind, give ju&s;t cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect the Appari|tions and Revelations. The followers of <HI>Montanus,</HI> pre|tended to prophe&s;y, but when the &s;pirit of Prophe&s;y came upon ehem they would be in <HI>Ec&s;ta&s;ies.</HI> Now both <HI>Jerom</HI> and <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> mention that as a &s;ign of their being no Prophets divinely in&s;pired. It is (&s;ays <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI>) the property of a <HI>Diviner</HI> to be <HI>Ec&s;tatical,</HI> but its otherwi&s;e with a true Prophet, his under&s;tanding is awake and his mind in a &s;ober orderly Temper. No doubt but that &s;ome of rhe fal&s;e Prophets among&s;t the Jews were impo&s;|ed on by <HI>Daemons.</HI> They thought that they had Angeli|cal or Divine Revelations, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 22.24. <HI>Jer.</HI> 29.8. The Hebrew Doctors &s;ay, it is a profound Que&s;tion, <HI>How the true Spirit of Prophe&s;y may be certainly known from
<PB N="17" REF="000756_0165_0FAA48276CDC0A10">
that which is fal&s;e</HI>? Nor do they give any &s;atisfactory Re&s;olution concerning it: only they &s;ay, that all Prophe|&s;y makes it &s;elf known to the Prophet by the &s;trength &amp; vigour of the perception. And that fal&s;e Prophe&s;y do's proceed from the too great force of the Imaginative power, and the Imbecillity of the rational. The Pro|phetical Spirit does never alienate the mind, &s;ince it &s;eats it &s;elf in the rational as well as in the &s;en&s;itive power. Again, If the&s;e <HI>White Angels</HI> appear to Females only, who are the weaker Sex, and more ea&s;y to be impo&s;ed on, that renders the ca&s;e yet the more &s;u&s;picious. It was part of the Devils &s;ubtilty in the fir&s;t Temptation, which he a&s;&s;aulted mankind with, that he began&punc; with the Wo|man; and he hath found &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, as to hold on in the &s;ame cour&s;e.

He &s;ayes that in <HI>September</HI> 1655. there was in the Pari&s;h where he then dwelt, one <HI>John Carpen|ter,</HI> who related to him what Vi&s;ions and Raptures he had experienced the night before: how he had been car|ried to hell, and what fearful things he had &s;een there; and al&s;o to Heaven, and what glorious things he had &s;een there. He was in tran&s;ports of joy, not doubting but that thou&s;ands would be Converted by his Revelations. Nor could he bear it, that any &s;hould call his Revelations into que&s;tion, which he was certain (as he thought) that they were of Divine In&s;piration. But within a while all appeared to be the effect of a natural di&s;ea&s;e.

There are many things mentioned by <HI>Carthu&s;ianus, Ger&s;on, Tyraeus, Malderus,</HI> &amp; others, by which they &s;uppo&s;e that Angelical Apparitions may be di&s;cern|ed from tho&s;e that are Diabolical. But I have met with no marks to judge by, either in them or in any other Authors, that are infallible. To in&s;tance here in &s;ome particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some &s;ay, That the Devil cannot appear without &s;ome deformity or other. That as he could not appear in the &s;hape of a man before man had &s;inned, and therefore came to our Fir&s;t Parents in the &s;hape of a Serpent; &s;o now though he can put on <HI>Humane Shape,</HI> yet that it mu&s;t be with &s;ome defect or other, a cloven foot, an ug|ly countenance, or the like. See Mr. <HI>Mede's</HI> Works&punc; fol. 282. <HI>P&s;ellus</HI> &s;uppo&s;eth not only that Angels have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery or fiery Bodies &s;o &s;ubtile as that they are to us invi&s;ible (of which opinion were many of the Ancients) but moreover, that the Angelical Body &s;ends forth rayes and <HI>&s;plendors</HI> which would dazle mortal eyes, but that the Bo|dy of an Evil Angel is ob&s;cure and &s;qualid. But the notion of Evil Angels always appearing with &s;ome deformity in their &s;hape is a <HI>vulgar error</HI> con|trary to the Scripture, which &s;ays expre&s;ly, that Satan can transform him&s;elf into an Angel of light. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.14. That he can appear like a venerable <HI>Samuel,</HI> who was an honourable man of God. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 9.6. &amp; 28.12. We may gather from the 13. <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> of that Chapter, that the Devil &s;eemed both to the Witch of <HI>Endor</HI> &amp; to Saul, to be a per&s;on clothed
<PB N="36" REF="000756_0184_0FAA484DAF16EA98">
with a Divine Maje&s;ty &amp; Brightne&s;s: he appeared like <HI>Elohim.</HI> This opinion has been often confu|ted by experience. What were tho&s;e <HI>Nymphes</HI> that the Gentiles of old were deceived with, but Devils appearing in a beautiful form? Do not Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Writers tell us of his appearing to <HI>Ana|tolius,</HI> and to St. <HI>Martin</HI> in mo&s;t glorious array? That in&s;tance of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> a Mr. of Art of <HI>Trin Colledge</HI> in <HI>Cambridge</HI> is remarkable. He had been a Magician &amp; a Conjurer: But God gave him repentance, and after he was reclaimed from the error of his way, he declared&punc; that the <HI>Daemon</HI> whom he had been wont to conver&s;e with, always appeared to him in the form of a man of good fa&s;hion: nor did he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver require or propo&s;e the making of any Covenant with him. See <HI>Glanvils</HI> Philo&s;ophical Con&s;iderations <HI>p.</HI> 42.</P>
<P N="2">2. It has been &s;aid, that Good Angels are terri|ble at their fir&s;t appearance, but not at their de|parture, whenas evil Angels do not appear fright fully at fir&s;t but at la&s;t. This is no infallible rule to judge by; nor does it agree with the Scripture. When three Angels appeared to <HI>Abraham,</HI> &amp; two came to <HI>Lot,</HI> they were not at fir&s;t terrifyed with the &s;ight of them. <HI>Gen.</HI> 18.3. &amp; 19.1, 2. The An|gel that vi&s;ited <HI>Manoah</HI> and his Wife, was not at his fir&s;t appearance terrible, but at his departure he was dreadful to them. <HI>Judg.</HI> 13.22. The Devils fir&s;t appearance to <HI>Saul</HI> as well as his la&s;t was a|mazing to him. The Scripture calls the Devil by the name of <HI>Seyir,</HI> whence the name of <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yr</HI>

&s;eems to be derived. <HI>Lev.</HI> 17.7. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 13.21. becau&s;e <HI>Daemons</HI> have oft appeared to men in that horrid Shape. The Hebrew word which is tran&s;lated <HI>Satyr</HI> the Seventy Greek interpreters expre&s;s by <HI>Daimonia,</HI> i. e. Devils: the word in its original &s;ignification notes &s;uch an horror as does make the hai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a mans head to &s;tand upright. For the mo&s;t part there is an horror attending Diabolical Apparitions: but it is not alwayes &s;o.</P>
<P N="3">3. Some have thought, that the Appa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ition of a good Angel leaveth no room for doubting. That per&s;ons vi&s;ited by holy Angels cannot po&s;&s;ibly have any he&s;itation in their minds, whether they are &s;uch o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no But this al&s;o is a mi&s;take. Men may con|ver&s;e with Angels, &amp; yet not be aware of it <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.2. Neither <HI>Abraham,</HI> nor <HI>Lot,</HI> nor <HI>Gideon,</HI> nor <HI>Mano|ah's</HI> Wife, nor he him&s;elf did at fir&s;t know that the per&s;ons who came and di&s;cour&s;ed with them, were Angels <HI>Judg.</HI> 13.16. When the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> came to the Mother of our Lord, &s;he was at fir&s;t at a lo&s;s about what was &s;poken to her: <HI>She was troubled at his &s;aying, &amp; ca&s;t in her mind, what manner of Salutation this &s;hould be.</HI> Luk. 1.29. As for the holy Prophets, they it is true neither did nor could doubt whether they were divinely in&s;pired. For that Divine light which was implanted in their under&s;tandings, did &s;hine with that power as made them certain that God &s;poke to them. There was an <HI>IDIOTES ARRETOS,</HI> an <HI>inexpre&s;&s;ible peculiarity</HI> in them. No man that was a &s;ubject of that Irra|diation, could be ignorant of it: nor could any
<PB N="38" REF="000756_0186_0FAA484EE3F0AF00">
per&s;ons be deceived be&s;ides &s;uch as had it not: which is more than can be affirmed of all Vi&s;ions or Apparitions of Angels.</P>
<P N="4">4. No infallible Judgment can be made by the words which they &s;peak, or the coun&s;el which they give, whether the appearing Spirits are good or evil Angels. <HI>Jacobus Vitriacus</HI> &s;peaks of one who was frequently vi&s;ited in his &s;leep by a <HI>Daemon,</HI> that did reprehend him for &s;ome of his faults, and al&s;o excite him to acts of piety &amp; devotion: but the <HI>Daemon</HI> u&s;ed this fraud with a de&s;ign to in&s;till &s;ome poy&s;onous notions into his mind. <HI>Delrio</HI> writes of a Monk unto whom the Devil appeared in the likene&s;s of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> exhorting him to read the Scriptures. The <HI>Daemon</HI> that acted <HI>Robert Church|man</HI> (a deluded <HI>Quaker</HI> at <HI>Bal&s;ham</HI> in Cambridge|&s;hire, whom the Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to Convert from the error of his way) told him, that the Doctrine of the <HI>Trinity</HI> was true, and that God had an Elect People; that tho&s;e whom the Father had Elected, the Son had Redeemed, and whom Chri&s;t Redeems, the holy Spirit Sanctifies; and directed him to go to a Mini&s;ter for further In|&s;truction. Have not cur&s;ed Magicians pretended, that the Caele&s;tial Spirits would communicate their &s;ecrets to none but Sanctified ones? That men who would have a familiar conver&s;ation with tho&s;e Spirits to reveal &s;ecrets to them, mu&s;t be careful to keep them&s;elves from enormous &s;ins, and pray daily to the mo&s;t High, v. <HI>Boi&s;&s;ard de &s;ecretis Ma|giae</HI> Cap. 1. p. 30.

Would not any man have taken this coun&s;eller for a good An|gel? Let me here take notice of another Example, which many &s;till alive do remember. In the I&s;lands of <HI>Fer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> which are &s;ubject to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> there was in the year 1667. a young man who&s;e name is <HI>Jacob Oluff&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>: he on <HI>January</HI> 7<HI>th.</HI> in that year, was afflicted with a di&s;ea&s;e that made him keep within doors a fortnight: on <HI>January</HI> 20<HI>th.</HI> be|ing Lords day there appeared to him one in &s;hining garments, and made the room where he was, full of &s;plendor. He gave a kind Salutation to the young man, asking him about his pain, and then &s;troking him with his hand, the young man was pre&s;ently healed. This &s;hining Spirit u&s;ed tho&s;e words to him, <HI>Be thou whole and &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no more.</HI> He exhorted him to pray three times every day, and that he &s;hould admoni&s;h the people where he lived, that they &s;hould pray al&s;o, and that they &s;hould leave off their Cur&s;ing &amp; Swearing, &amp; de&s;i&s;t from all other &s;ins, that &s;o the anger of God may be ap|pea&s;ed: So did the Spirit depart from him.

Some Authors write of tho&s;e who having had familiar Spirits, would &s;peak highly of Chri&s;t, whenas thereby they intended him whom they had devoted them&s;elves unto, who (not without the highe&s;t Bla&s;phemy) called him&s;elf Chri&s;t, and would be wor&s;hipped above all that is called God.
