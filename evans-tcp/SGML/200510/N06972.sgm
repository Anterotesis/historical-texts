<HEAD>A Letter from the Brethren called <HI>Quakers.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are concerned to find, that on both &s;ides, in&s;tead of keeping to this &s;hort que&s;tion, Whether the pre&s;ent manner of carrying on the war in <HI>Germany</HI> is for the advantage, or di&s;advantage, of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI> you make digre&s;&s;ions which have no|thing to do with the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>There is much &s;olid rea&s;oning in the <HI>Con&s;ider|ations:</HI> But why does the author &s;hew &s;o much &s;pleen again&s;t the king of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia?</HI> Does it affect the que&s;tion, whether his maje&s;ty was formerly an enemy, or a friend, to the Elector of <HI>Hanover?</HI> Whether he be a religious man, or void of re|ligion? Or whether he had in his view the de|fence of the prote&s;tant religion, or not, <HI>&amp;c?</HI> The&s;e things, and many more, are only thrown out to amu&s;e the reader, or to move the pa&s;|&s;ions: At the &s;ame time we own, that the author &s;eems to be a lover of his country; whereas, in mo&s;t of what we have &s;een wrote again&s;t him, there &s;eems to be marks of venality, and a time-&s;erving &s;pirit.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned, by every impartial, &s;en&s;ible man, that there never was a time when the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> arms made &s;o great and glorious an appearance as at pre&s;ent: And however we don't approve of par|ticular per&s;ons u&s;ing carnal weapons, in private quarrels, yet we think every nation has a right to defend their country, and we rejoice to &s;ee the good &s;ucce&s;s of his maje&s;ty's arms, during the three la&s;t years, again&s;t <HI>France</HI>; the only nation that we, and all <HI>Europe,</HI> have rea&s;on to guard again&s;t.</P>
<P>We have now got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all <HI>North Ame|rica,</HI> which alone is worth much more than the war has yet co&s;t us; as it &s;ecures to us, by the fi&s;heries there, a perpetual nur&s;ery of &s;ailors, and
<PB N="4" REF="008860_0003_102FF92E86F88FA8">
deprives <HI>France</HI> of having it in their power to man a fleet; and furni&s;hes us with an opportunity of &s;upplying <HI>Europe</HI> with fi&s;h, a branch of trade that mu&s;t produce &s;ome millions of &s;pecie yearly. In &s;hort, by our &s;ucce&s;&s;es in <HI>America</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> our trade is &s;o greatly increa&s;ed, that it is believed our import of &s;pecie is by more than a million greater than it was before the war began.</P>
<P>As to the war we now carry on in <HI>Germany,</HI> it is plain, to &s;upport it, we export upwards of five millions yearly, including the &s;ub&s;idy paid to the king of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI>; which, we are afraid, is more than we can bear, for any length of time. The computation of the quantity of &s;pecie in the nation before the war began, was between twelve and fifteen millions; and &s;uppo&s;ing it to be much more, by &s;uch an export in a few years, we &s;hould be rendered incapable of carrying on our trade, and defending our&s;elves. The que&s;tion then comes to this: Are we &s;o much intere&s;ted in the quarrel between the queen of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the king of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> or in the defence of <HI>Hanover,</HI> as to ren|der our&s;elves unable to take care of our&s;elves? We admire the king of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI>'s per&s;onal great qualities; we know the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> to be the mo&s;t per&s;ecuting hou&s;e in <HI>Europe,</HI> of tho&s;e who are prote&s;tants; we know what they have done to their prote&s;tant &s;ubjects in <HI>Hungary, Bohemia, Tran|&s;ylvania, Moravia,</HI> and in <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> when it was theirs; and therefore, as lovers of mankind, and haters of popi&s;h per&s;ecuting principles, we &s;hould think it the duty of this nation to join their proportion with other prote&s;tant powers, to prevent the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> from having it in their power, by cru&s;h|ing the king of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> to treat his prote&s;tant &s;ub|jects as they have done their own. But if other prote&s;tant powers won't join with us, and, on the contrary, will throw their weight in the oppo&s;ite &s;cale; our attempting this &s;ingly, would be en|deavouring to do a thing on the continent &s;o much
<PB N="5" REF="008860_0004_102FF93021DD6B18">
beyond our &s;trength, that it would de&s;erve the name of madne&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ame way of rea&s;oning will hold, as to our carrying on war again&s;t <HI>France</HI> on the continent. Had we, in the beginning of this war, not meddled with the quarrel between the queen of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the king of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> nor detached him from <HI>France,</HI> by engaging him to defend <HI>Hanover,</HI> we &s;hould have been free of this intolerable ex|pence of maintaining the army under prince <HI>Ferdi|nand</HI>; but it is needle&s;s now to reflect on what is pa&s;t. We have brought the king of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> into our quarrel; the que&s;tion is, how to extricate our|&s;elves mo&s;t for the intere&s;t and honour of the nation; and tho' it may appear to be a difficult ta&s;k to under|take to do this, we don't think it impracticable, if we lay a&s;ide the thoughts of bringing about a peace, by treating with <HI>France.</HI> If we treat with them, 'tis next to impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e what they will have in view, is &s;ingly to recover back from us what we have taken from them, or part of it, as a price for that peace; and no lover of his country can ever approve of giving them back one inch in <HI>North America.</HI> Their de&s;ire is to continue the de|va&s;tations in <HI>Germany,</HI> and to make <HI>Germans</HI> cut one anothers throats.</P>
<P>On the other hand by endeavouring to bring about a peace between the queen of <HI>Hungary</HI> and the king of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> we &s;hall treat with powers, who&s;e intere&s;t it is that we keep our conque&s;t, and who mu&s;t wi&s;h to &s;top the effu&s;ion of <HI>German</HI> blood; as there never can be any danger of our endeavour|ing to make conque&s;ts on the continent, were we ever &s;o rich; whereas the riches and power of <HI>France</HI> mu&s;t always be dangerous to its neighbours.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the queen of <HI>Hungary</HI> de&s;erves no fa|vours from us; but if by &s;erving her, we &s;erve our&s;elves, we &s;hould not let re&s;entment get the bet|ter of the public good, and therefore our bu&s;ine&s;s is to make up matters between the king of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="008860_0005_102FF93271BC19F8">
and queen of <HI>Hungary.</HI> This &s;cheme of reconciling the contending powers in <HI>Germany,</HI> or bringing <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> into our intere&s;ts, &s;eems to be the only ra|tional part for <HI>Great Britain</HI> to act on the continent.</P>
<P>The armies at pre&s;ent belonging to <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and the queen of <HI>Hungary,</HI> joined to that under prince <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> could in one campaign, by going into the heart of <HI>France,</HI> and by our fleets ravaging their coa&s;ts, and rai&s;ing contributions, force it into any terms of peace that &s;hould be propo&s;ed. By this &s;cheme, we &s;hould extricate our&s;elves from a war we are unable to &s;upport in the way it is carried on, and at the &s;ame time effectually reduce the power of <HI>France,</HI> and di&s;able her for the future from di&s;turbing the peace of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>For hereafter it ought to be a rule with us, not to engage <HI>France</HI> on the continent; they are equal|ly our &s;uperiors there, as we are theirs at &s;ea; and by keeping an army on board our fleets, we are able to a&s;&s;i&s;t our allies on the continent more effect|ually, by attacking the i&s;lands belonging to <HI>France</HI> and their coa&s;t, than by &s;ending troops on the con|tinent; and we &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, &s;ave the export of our money, and the lives of our people.</P>
<P>It is really &s;hameful to &s;ee how this nation has of late years &s;uffered it&s;elf to be the dupe of <HI>German</HI> princes. In king <HI>William</HI>'s time, we a&s;&s;i&s;ted them to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the power of <HI>France,</HI> and they thought them&s;elves much indebted to us, and exerted their utmo&s;t &s;trength to &s;econd our en|deavours. But the language of <HI>German</HI> princes of late to us has been this: If you don't pay and main|tain our troops, and likewi&s;e &s;end your own troops to defend us again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> who want to cut our throats, we will join with them, and allow them to take <HI>Hanover</HI>; and &s;urely, if they can keep us in the humour to pay them for defending their own liberties, and put their own revenues in their pockets, they act wi&s;ely, though not generou&s;ly; but don't we give them cau&s;e to laugh at us at the &s;ame time?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="008860_0006_102FF933F26AAD60">Pray what does <HI>Great Britain</HI> get by keeping <HI>He&s;&s;ians, Brun&s;wickers,</HI> &amp;c. in pay in peace? No|thing; for, in ca&s;e of a war, they are unable to defend <HI>Hanover</HI> again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> which is the only u&s;e we have for them; and if they were able, does there ever a &s;hilling come from that country to <HI>Great Britain?</HI> It mu&s;t always be our intere&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Germany</HI> again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> by keeping an army on board our fleets ready to attack them, which mu&s;t oblige them to keep a large army at home to defend their coa&s;ts; but &s;ending great &s;ums of money and troops to the continent, to carry on a war again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> is like a weak man's attacking a &s;trong man, and giving him the choice of the ground to fight on.</P>
<P>Surely we cannot imagine that <HI>German</HI> princes wi&s;h to be conquered by <HI>France</HI>; and therefore, if we will appear as their friends, not as their dupes, we will always find them ready to defend them|&s;elves, and thankful for our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But if they find that our regard to <HI>Hanover</HI> is &s;uch, that we will rather take the whole burthen of a war on the con|tinent again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> than &s;uffer them to invade it, they will continue to exhau&s;t this nation of men and money, make us &s;laves to their intere&s;t, and pick our pockets, as long as we have a &s;hilling.</P>
<P>If his maje&s;ty &s;hall think it proper to give <HI>H&mdash;r</HI> to a younger branch of the royal family, that would in our opinion, be greatly for the intere&s;t both of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>H&mdash;r,</HI> by taking away a pre|tence from <HI>France</HI> for invading it, when at war with us. But as long as the &s;ame per&s;on is king of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and elector of <HI>H&mdash;r,</HI> we have but one method to take, in ca&s;e of a war with <HI>France,</HI> viz. to let them take it, in&s;tead of maintaining an army for its defence; and to make repri&s;als by our &s;u|periority at &s;ea.</P>
<P>There never was a prince &s;ince <HI>Titus Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> who began his reign with greater marks of love to his &s;ubjects, love to ju&s;tice, and every aimiable
<PB N="8" REF="008860_0007_102FF937033628A8">
quality, than our pre&s;ent &s;overeign has done. He &s;eems re&s;olved to be &s;overeign of the hearts of all his &s;ubjects, and not the king of a faction. It is be|lieved that he has declared he won't allow his &s;er|vants to meddle in elections, either by making u&s;e of his name, or the public money, to procure votes; by which he will have a true repre&s;entation of his people in parliament, in&s;tead of a packt meeting, the child of corruption and venality. This mu&s;t make him adored by his &s;ubjects, and prevent any wicked man about his per&s;on from having it in his power to make his &s;overeign his dupe, by making him believe that he only meant to employ the public money, and his &s;overeign's name, to &s;erve him; whereas his real intention is, to get his own creatures and dependents cho&s;en, in order to make him&s;elf the director of his ma&s;ters actions; by which piece of management we have often &s;een a dirty &s;lave of a mini&s;ter carry an election again&s;t men of worth and family; and the &s;overeign made believe that the man of worth was his enemy, becau&s;e his love to his country made him refu&s;e being a &s;lave to the ba&s;e, corrupt intentions of that mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>To conclude, what obligations is the nation under to her royal highne&s;s, and tho&s;e employed by her, about the per&s;on of his maje&s;ty, in his ten|der years, for in&s;tilling &s;uch principles into his mind, which, in all probability, will enable him to make it not only the happie&s;t, but the greate&s;t nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> by the de&s;truction of corruption, and encouraging public virtue!</P>
