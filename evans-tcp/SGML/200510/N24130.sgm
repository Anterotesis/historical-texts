<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE ingenuity of man diligently searches for the authority of precedent, to sanc|tion the propriety of a favorite measure; but the revolution which produced the chearful hilarity of this day is entitled to our grateful commemora|tion, not from a servile imitation of ancient cus|toms, but from its own abstract and intrinsic me|rits. The preservation of our independence is intimately connected with a preservation of those sentiments and opinions which gave birth to it, and the experience of one and twenty years affords an ample conviction that the spirit which an imat|ed our countrymen at the glorious epoch we cele|brate, still warms our bosoms&mdash;nor has an unin|terrupted enjoyment of the desired boon, lessened in our view its inestimable value. Those testimo|nies of lively recollection which have mark'd each successive return of this anniversary, unequivo|cally
<PB N="6" REF="031907_0005_0FEF45E99CE65890">
demonstrate that time has not cooled the fervid glow of patriotism, which characterized the ever memorable period of seventy-six.</P>
<P>"THE feelings, manners and principles" which led three millions of our species disdainfully to repel the insidious approaches of tyranny, form a subject for sublime speculation and dignified dis|cussion&mdash;the frequent elegance and ability, how|ever, with which it has been treated, preclude every attempt at originality; scarce leave a novelty of expression to the speaker of the present day. But the joyous festivity of the occasion and the impressive candor which beams from every coun|tenance instruct me that the severity of criticism has no part in the object of this assembly.</P>
<P>THE baleful spirit of religious persecution which chased our forefathers from the land of their nativity, compelled them to take refuge in the dens and caverns of a wilderness&mdash;greatly preferring the inhospitable wilds of America with freedom of sentiment, to the luxurious abodes of cultivated Europe when shackled by oppression. Here then we discover the source from which arose that delicacy of feelings, that purity of man|ners, that rigid inflexibility of principles which
<PB N="7" REF="031907_0006_0FEF47BCE5035F50">
gave birth to our admirable republic. Degene|rate indeed must have been their offspring had they suffer'd the hand of tyranny, to stifle in <HI>their</HI> bosoms, the glowing spirit of such progenitors. It were needless to repeat the various perils which our settlers encountered in their infant establish|ment; to describe a warfare with the treacherous inhabitant of the woods, novel in its manner, and cruel in its conduct. Suffice it, that under every impression of difficulty and danger, still their set|tlements flourished; and by progressive improve|ment, became at the commencement of the pre|sent century, the strongest arm of the British em|pire. The inhabitants of the, then, American colonies, were filled with sentiments of loyalty to their king and veneration for the constitution of Great Britain. Thanks to the foolish policy of her ministers, those sentiments so inimical to our national grandeur were not permitted to re|main.</P>
<P>MANY oppressive acts of government had in|spired the people of America, with the most dread|ful apprehensions. The safety of those darling rights and privileges for which they were ready to sacrifice their lives, appear'd imminently en|dangered. Still, however, they entertain'd a
<PB N="8" REF="031907_0007_0FEF325517C2B3E0">
lively hope that a submissive deportment and a modest representation of their grievances would obtain from the justice and generosity of the pa|rent country, ample reparation for injuries which they had sustained, and security against the inflic|tion of others, in future. But the humble peti|tions of America were answered with insult, her agents treated with the foulest contempt, and the right of taxing us "in all cases whatever," at length, avowed as a principle equitable in itself, and strictly conformable to the political constitu|tion of Great-Britain. A declaration at once so oppressive and absurd, discover'd to America the precipice on which she stood. The tyrannic mea|sures of a British ministry, and the obsequious devotion of a British parliament, roused in every breast a merited detestation of the government, and a resolute determination to resist.</P>
<P>THE agents employed in the favorite plan of subjugating the colonies endeavor'd not by lenient measures, to mould and fashion the minds of the people to their purposes; but a system of terror and intimidation appear'd to promise a more speedy success and more permanent effects. Un|awed however by the threats, and undismayed by the many outrages which they suffer'd, the inha|bitants
<PB N="9" REF="031907_0008_0FEF32526F84D350">
of the different States, associating more intimately in the hour of danger, discovered am|ple resources in that spirit of unanimity which pervaded all ranks of society, and determined by a decisive declaration of their Independence to shiver the disgraceful manacles of slavery which were prepared for them. How august is the spectacle which they exhibited to the world. An infant nation struggling against the full grown strength of an ancient and powerful monarchy; having in vain attempted by the force of reason and entreaty to obtain redress from their haughty tyrants, solemnly announcing to mankind, their determination to be free or perish in the attempt. Uninfluenced by the trifling considerations of pri|vate interest; unaffected by the singular peril of their situation; surrounded by the fleets and ar|mies of the foe, the representatives of America, in the presence of Almighty GOD, declare that the tyranny of the parent country had absolved them from all obligations of allegiance. That henceforth they were and of right ought to be, a free, sovereign and independent people. Thus having destroyed the possibility of reconciliation, it remain'd for them, to support with every effort of patriotism, a declaration announced, with such affecting solemnity.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="031907_0009_0FEF45F50D5B4020">
HOWEVER unprepared for warfare with antago|nists so far their superiors in the deadly practice, still they shrunk not from the unequal contest. To the hardy veterans of Europe they opposed the rude untrained levies of the moment, the volun|tary exertions of individuals and the sanctified justice of their cause. The only object they con|templated, was their country's freedom, the only efforts they employed, fair and honorable con|flict in arms. No murderous proscription, traced the steps of our revolution, in the blood of assassi|nated brethren. No mockery of justice, made the difference of opinion a signal for execution. The American cause needed not the aid of such auxiliaries. Founded in justice, conducted with firmness and discretion, it ended in the most am|ple and unbounded success. Search the varied history of nations: analise the discordant princi|ples of government, the records of mankind afford not an instance of a revolution so important, ef|fected with so few enormities. To the wise pro|visions of our venerable forefathers are we indebt|ed for such salutary effects. Their early establish|ments for the education of youth rendered the attainment of knowledge easy to the poorest mem|ber of the community. Hence their rights were clearly understood, the blessings of genuine liberty ardently pursued and the visionary wanderings of its phantom most judiciously avoided.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="031907_0010_0FEF460A21886190">
THAT our revolution was so little disgraced by cruelty and injustice much also is due to the exertions of our clergy, and it is with pride I here offer my humble tribute of applause to that devout and learned profession. The holy precepts of our religion which they inculcated, and the bright examples of virtue which they exhibited, gave them a great and merited influence with the people. To their eternal honour be it recorded, <HI>that</HI> influence exerted on the side of liberty and humanity, in a great measure restrained those wild excesses which have too frequently blasted in the execution, a cause designed by the noblest motives of the human mind.</P>
<P>HAVING obtain'd the glorious object of our contest, and wrung from the government of Great Britain, a tardy and reluctant acknowledgment of our Independence, the period which restor'd peace to our nation was replete also with danger. The system of Federation which had answered every purpose while we were under the impression of a foreign foe, was found totally inadequate to the intention, when that powerful incentive to union, was removed. The united wisdom of the continent was therefore summoned to devise a more eligible plan of national government. The production of this assembly of sages
<PB N="12" REF="031907_0011_0FEF460226FB0100">
was that happy combination of liberty and law, the Federal Constitution, under which we now exist; a work, which would have added reputation to the character of a Solon or Licurgus. And under whose genial influence the United States have advanced toward wealth and prosperity, with a rapidity unexampled in the annals of the world.</P>
<P>BUT while we contemplate with unfeigned joy the auspicious effects of our revolution, we can|not but observe with the most painful anxiety, that the mad fury of Eurpoean politics threatens to cast a gloom o'er the bright prospects of our political horizon, and to involve us in the calam|itous consequences of a war which hath already deluged with blood the fairest quarters of the globe.&mdash;The refusal of France to receive our mi|nister, and her unprovoked depredations on our commerce teach us the instructive lesson, that na|tional friendships and national partialities exist only in the distempered imagination of the enthu|siastic theorist. This conduct is not only a viola|tion of the law of nations, but an infraction of a treaty most solemnly ratified between us. The reason assign'd for such violent outrages is but an aggravation of the insult; and must excite the in|dignation
<PB N="13" REF="031907_0012_0FEF45DF1CDCD6F8">
of every American who has the discern|ment to perceive, or the sensibility that can feel, the wounded honor of his country.&mdash;Much has been said of the gratitude due to France for her assistance in the glorious revolution which we ce|lebrate. The motives of this assistance it is unne|cessary to develope. But the credit which she would derive from it, is justly lost in a systematic and insidious attempt to create dissentions be|tween the people and constituted authorities of our country.&mdash;To individuals of the French na|tion we are indebted for great and important ser|vices. To the armies which fought by our sides we feel sentiments of grateful acknowledgment; nor shall the injustice of their country ever banish from our minds the sweet remembrance of their gallant deeds. While Frenchmen were contend|ing for that liberty, which we so eminently enjoy, however we might disapprove the means, still on the grand principle we wished them success; we were their friends in reality not by profession, but their attempt to influence and distract our coun|cils, has made a ravage in our friendship that cannot easily be forgotten. As an independent nation, the responsibility of our measures rests with us. <HI>"If we have committed errors and those can be demonstrated we shall be willing to correct
<PB N="14" REF="031907_0013_0FEF4603D0893B08">
them; if we have done injuries, we shall be willing, on conviction, to redress them,"</HI>&mdash;but the guardians of our own honor we can not, will not, tamely submit to the imperious dictates of a foreign power.</P>
<P>THOSE native principles of liberty, which esta|blished will protect our independence and convince the intriguing politics of every nation, that be|tween the people and government of America, there is not the shadow of distinction.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may be the event of negotiation, however desirous to maintain peace and amity with the French Republic, still it becomes us to be pre|pared for all events, and if the sad alternative must be unqualified submission to their will or opposi|tion in arms, I will not insult the spirit and bravery of my countrymen by a doubt upon their choice&mdash;on a subject like this, we shall all be united. Away then with the ridiculous distinctions of party, we are Americans, and glorying in the cha|racter we swear to transmit it unsullied to posterity.</P>
<P>FROM a view of our foreign relations we chear|fully recur to the prosperous state of our domestic affairs, and permit me here, my fellow citizens, to congratulate you upon the late election to the chief magistracy of this Commonwealth. It is
<PB N="15" REF="031907_0014_0FEF45F6D507CDE8">
the singular felicity of governments constituted like ours, that offices of honor and trust are confi|ded to those only whose merit has designated them the safe and dignified repository of the laws: at a period too when the venerable ADAMS, o'erplied with public energies, demands of his country a rest from his labors, it is with the highest satisfac|tion, that we contemplate in the character of his successor, those virtues which will adorn, those talents which will ably discharge, the important duties of his elevated station.</P>
<P>SINCE our last annual celebration of this great and glorious day, an event has occurred, which will give a striking example to mankind, of republican moderation and political integrity. That illustrious man whose Herculean arm stran|gled in the cradle of our liberties, the serpents of despotism and oppression; having devoted to his country the most valuable moments of his life, vo|luntarily descends from the high and lofty station, which the voice of applauding millions had assign|ed him, and seeks in the bosom of retirement, to close a life, marked with the splendid characters of virtue, magnanimity and honor. Far is it above my feeble talent, to add a single sprig, to the wreaths of laurel, which adorn his brow, but while gratitude shall warm our hearts, while we
<PB N="16" REF="031907_0015_0FEF45E250C0B628">
feel the proud sentiment that we are the country|men of WASHINGTON, let us aspirate to heaven a prayer, that in his philosophic retirement, every joy and blessing of life may be accorded him; that no dark cloud may obscure the mild radiance of his setting sun</P>
<LG>
<L>"And when old time shall lead him to his end,</L>
<L>Goodness and he fill up one monument."</L>
</LG>
<P>THE successor of Washington, it must be ac|knowledged, has a great and arduous task. Hap|py for our country her choice has fallen on a man whose long, laborious services, in times when every step was mark'd with danger and dismay, pronounce him fully adequate to the exigency of the case. If a profound knowledge in the science of government, a decisive firmness and intrepidity of conduct, a cool deliberating head and an honest feeling heart, are requisites to constitute the en|lightened statesman; the presidential chair of America will continue to exhibit that luminous display of patriotic virtue and dignified deport|ment which have rendered it the pride of our own country, the envied admiration of others.</P>
<P>AMERICANS! we possess a country extensive and luxuriant. Nature has with a lavish hand bestowed upon it her choicest gifts. The prolific
<PB N="17" REF="031907_0016_0FEF45F9E6E371C0">
bosom of the earth chearfully yields a rich and copious harvest to the industrious exertions of her children. Our constitution, the result of our own deliberate choice, secures to us every right consist|ent with good order and the general welfare. What then, my friends, can disturb the full tide of our prosperity. Will foreign foes invade our peaceful shores, destroy the palladium of our lib|erties, and subject us to the insolent rapacity of a conqueror? We may defy the combined despots of the earth. Do we fear, lest ambition and the lust of power should establish on the ruin of our republic, a haughty dominion of aristocracy? Dread it not, the American nation clearly under|stands and vigilantly guards its right; the at|tempt would be ridiculous, the consequent failure inevitable. But while we are secure from such attempts, let us beware that our liberty degenerate not into licentiousness. Here is the destroying angel of republics. Let us therefore cautiously avoid that spirit of jealousy which leads to ever|lasting innovation; that spirit which disappointed politicians and discontented demagogues will in|variably convert to the purposes of faction and disorder. A government like ours rests on the broad basis of public opinion; give it then tho full energy of your influence, and suffer no impe|diment
<PB N="18" REF="031907_0017_0FEF45E7D221CCC8">
to check the constitutional rotation of its wheels. The federal constitution preserved on its grand principle, the strict union of the states; a sedulous attention to the character of your public servants and a strict regard to morality and the education of youth, will enable you to baffle the intrigues of pretended friends, successfully to op|pose the attacks of open enemies and perpetuate to generations yet unborn, those blessings for which you have toiled and bled.</P>
<P>THUS happy in the enjoyment of all those rights and privileges, which render life desira|ble, we cannot but lament that a very large proportion of the discover'd world, still lan|guishes under the lash of oppression. That in many countries, where the richest luxuriancy of soil and most inviting salubrity of climate pre|vail, the inhabitants, inveloped in more than monkish ignorance, hold their lives and property subject to the wretched possessions of some human monster. In others, a stupid veneration even for the follies and vices of antiquity, have opposed an almost insurmountable barrier to the introduc|tion of learning or improvement. But in the eye of reason, it is clearly demonstrable, that the di|vine influence of genuine liberty must ultimately
<PB N="19" REF="031907_0018_0FEF4607A244DB90">
prevail; and to this period of darkness will suc|ceed, a corruscation of light that will penetrate the deepest recesses of bigotry and ignorance. Nothing will more tend to produce this desired event than the liberal dissemination of those prin|ciples upon which the rational system of <HI>our</HI> lib|erty is predicated. The towering flight of the American eagle, hath already described in the political horizon, the glorious path to freedom and independence. May the nations of the earth profit by the brilliancy of the example. We fond|ly cherish the hope that the auspicious moment will arrive, when the great orb of day, shall not, with his genial rays, illumine a single corner of this globe, which feels the hand of Tyranny or acknowledges the power of a master. Then will the consequences which have flowed and will continue to flow from our revolution, be duly appreciated. Then will the applauding world, with joy record, the period which gave it birth; and this day, so grateful to our feelings, so honorable to our nation, shall universally be celebrated as the grand jubilee of LIBERTY.</P>
