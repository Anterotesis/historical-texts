<P>WE His Maje&s;ties mo&s;t Loyal and dutiful Subjects, the Repre&s;entatives of the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;sachu&s;etts-Bay</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> doe mo&s;t humbly crave leave to pre&s;ent to Your Excellency, our mo&s;t Sincere and Hearty Congratulations for Your &s;afe Arrival within this part of Your Government. And at the &s;ame time, in Your Il|lu&s;trious Pre&s;ence, to render our acknowledgements to Almighty GOD for the many in&s;tances of His &s;pecial Providence and Benignity, both to Your Excellency and this People manife&s;ted, from Your de&s;ignation unto Your Acce&s;&s;ion to this Province.</P>
<P>We cannot but admire the manife&s;t foot&s;teps of a Gracious Providence in determining the Royal Heart of His Sacred Maje&s;ty, to choo&s;e and appoint Your Lord&s;hip to be Governour in Chief of this Province; and its no le&s;s a wonder, that Your Excellency, a Per&s;on of &s;o Noble a Virtue, and &s;tanding &s;o near the fountain of Honour, and fair for greater preferments, &s;hould entertain the thoughts of moving to &s;o remote a Province: We will believe and &s;ay, becau&s;e Almighty GOD, and our Great KING <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> Loved this People, Your Excellency is made their GOVERNOUR.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039345_0002_10141E5E30ECEED0">We mu&s;t next Expre&s;s our &s;ence of the Divine Goodne&s;s to Your Excellency, that pre&s;erved You in a tedious and difficult Voyage upon an Element not the mo&s;t friendly to the firme&s;t Con&s;titutions, and in a &s;ea&s;on not only rarely free from dangers, but unu&s;ually &s;evere and hazzardous; but above all, we are obliged to remark the propitiou&s;ne&s;s of Heaven, in &s;ecuring Your Excellencies Per&s;on and Your Noble Family from the Contagion that ha's made the I&s;land You put in at, the Grave of an Unaccountable number of Brave and Generous <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men.</P>
<P>And &s;ince that; We have had fre&s;h cau&s;es of adoring the Almighties continued Goodne&s;s in the pre&s;erving Your Excellency, during Your abode in that Unhappily divided part of Your Government, which You &s;o lately left: and in ble&s;&s;ing Your Lord&s;hip with that Wi&s;dom, and Conduct that is become Con&s;picuous, by Your leaving our Neigh|bours le&s;s unhappy, becau&s;e more Compo&s;ed than of late they have been.</P>
<P>We cannot look upon the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of the Divine Providence to|wards Your Excellency, but with the deepe&s;t Gratitude and Acknow|ledgments, becau&s;e they are &s;o many Pledges, and create in us &s;uch Vigo|rous hopes, of our abiding happine&s;s under Your Lord&s;hips Influence and Conduct thus re&s;erved to us, by &s;uch and &s;o many Peculiar In|&s;tances of the favour and care of Heaven.</P>
<P>Give us leave, <HI>SIR,</HI> only to a&s;&s;ure Your Excellency, That We (and we now Addre&s;s Your Excellency as the Repre&s;entative Body of this Province) in our &s;everal Stations, as we are in right and Gratitude bound, &s;hall expre&s;s our Loyalty to His Sacred Maje&s;ty in all Dutifulne&s;s and Obedience to Your Excellency, the Image and Character of our Great and mo&s;t Gracious Sovereign.</P>
<P>And now with the United Devotion of this Province, We hum|bly Implore the &s;ame Almighty Providence &s;till to continue Your Pro|tector: and may Your Lord&s;hips Health be re&s;tored and perfectly Confirmed, Your Government here &s;ure, &s;teady and la&s;ting, Your happine&s;s continue and Increa&s;e, until it be perfected in the Eternal Kingdom.</P>
