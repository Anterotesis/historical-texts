<HEAD>An Ab&s;tract OF A LETTER From a Per&s;on of Eminency and worth in <HI>Caledonia</HI> to a Friend at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have Received yoar kind Letter of the 26 <HI>December</HI> la&s;t, and Communicated it to the Gentlemen of the Council here; to whom your kind Sentiments, and Readine&s;s were very ac|ceptable.</P>
<P>Certainly the Work here begun is the mo&s;t Ripened, Dige&s;ted, and the be&s;t Founded, as to Priviledges, Place, Time, and other like Advantages, that ever was yet begun in any part of the Trading World. We Arrived upon this Coa&s;t the fir&s;t, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the third of <HI>November:</HI> Our Scituation is about Two Leagues to the Southward of <HI>Golden-I&s;land,</HI> (by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> called <HI>Guarda</HI>) in one of the be&s;t &amp; mo&s;t defenceable Harbours perhaps in the World. The Country is Healthful to a wonder; in&s;omuch that our own Sick, which were many when we Arrived, are now generally cured. The Country is exceeding Fertile, and the Weather Temperate: The Country where we are Settled, is

dry, and ri&s;ing ground, Hills but not High; and on the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and quite to the tops, three, four or five foot good fat mould, not a Rock or Stone to be &s;een. We have but Eight or Nine <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, where <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to the South <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.

For our Neighbour <HI>Indians</HI> are willing to be the joyful Me&s;&s;engers of our Settlement, and good di&s;po&s;ition to their Country-men. As to the Innate Riches of the Countrey, upon the fir&s;t information, I always believed to be very great: but now find it goes beyond all that ever I thought, or conceited in that matter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as we can under&s;tand, are very much &s;urprize<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> and alarm'd, and the more that it comes as a Thunder-clap upon the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">; ha|ving had no notice <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">f us, un<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> three days after our A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ival.

If Merchants &s;hould once Erect Factories here, this place will &s;oon become the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Mart in all <HI>America,</HI> both for In-land and Over-land Trade. We want here Sloops and Coa&s;ting Ve&s;&s;els; for want of which, and by rea&s;on we have been all hands at work in fortifying and fitting our &s;elves (which is now pretty well over) we have had but little Trade as yet: mo&s;t of our Goods Un&s;old. We are here a Thou&s;and one hundred Men, and expect Supplies every day. We have been exceeding unhappy in loo&s;ing two Mini&s;ters who came with us from <HI>Scot|land</HI>; and if <HI>New England</HI> could &s;upply us in that, it would be a great and la&s;ting Obligation.</P>
