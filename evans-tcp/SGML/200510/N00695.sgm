<HEAD>By His Excellency <HI>Richard Earl of Bellomont,</HI> Captain General and Governour in Chief of His Maje&s;ties Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and Territories depending thereon in <HI>America,</HI> and Vice Admiral of the &s;ame, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A PROCLAMATION</HEAD>
<P>WHereas the Proprietors of <HI>Ea&s;t-New-Jar&s;ey</HI> have been very pre&s;&s;ing with the Right Honourable, the Lords Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for Trade and Plantations, to have the Priviledge of a Port at <HI>Perth-Amboy</HI> within the &s;aid Collony of <HI>New-Jar&s;ey,</HI> a&s;&s;ertaining that they have a Right thereunto by virtue of a Grant they obtained from the late King <HI>James,</HI> dated the 14th of <HI>March,</HI> 1682. though in reality he was then only <HI>Duke of York,</HI> and derived his Title thereunto from a preceeding Grant from his Royal Brother King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd; and have thereupon complained, that their Rights and Properties have been invaded by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> in compelling their Ships to go up to <HI>New-York,</HI> and d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ing of them the benefit of a Port at <HI>Perth-Amboy.</HI> Which Complaint having been taken into the Con&s;ideration of the &s;aid Right Honourable, the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for Trade and Plantations, who, with the Advice of his Maje&s;ties Attorney and Sollicitor General, gave unto His Maje&s;ty their humble Opinion, That by an Act of Parliament made in the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">th Year of King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd, cap. 7. entituled, <HI>An Act for the better &s;ecuring the Plantation Trade,</HI> That all Ports are to be appointed in the Plantations by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms of <HI>England,</HI> by and under the Authority and Direction of the Lord Trea&s;urer, or Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury in the re&s;pective Plantations, for the collecting &s;uch Cu&s;toms as are due to his Maje&s;ty in the&s;e Plantations. And that the afore&s;aid Power of appointing Ports, granted to the Commi&s;|&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms by the &s;aid Act, was not granted to the <HI>Duke of York</HI> by the &s;aid Letters Patents; and al&s;o the &s;aid <HI>Duke of York</HI>'s Grant to the Lord <HI>Berkley</HI> and Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> could not convey any &s;uch Power, becau&s;e he had no &s;uch power granted to him by the Crown. Whereupon it appeareth evident, That the &s;aid Proprietors have no manner of Right or Power to con&s;titute Ports either in <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> or <HI>We&s;t New Jar&s;ey,</HI> from the late King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd, the then <HI>Duke of York,</HI> or any other Per&s;on deriving Authority from either of them, but that a Power of con&s;tituting &s;uch Ports in any of his Maje&s;ties Plantations, is ve&s;ted by Act of Parliament in the Commi&s;&s;ioners of his Maje&s;ties Cu&s;toms, under the Directions of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of his Maje&s;ty's Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>And the &s;aid Right Honourable, the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade and Plantations were further humbly of Opinion, That all Priviledges &s;hould, as much as po&s;&s;ible, be pre&s;erved unto the Province of <HI>New-York.</HI> Which his Maje&s;ty was most graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to Approve; and thereupon was plea&s;ed to di&s;mi&s;s the &s;aid Petition of the Proprietors of <HI>Ea&s;t New-Jar&s;ey</HI>&punc; and to order, That there be not any Innovation within the River of <HI>New-York,</HI> nor any Goods to pa&s;s up the &s;ame, but what &s;hall have paid the Duties at <HI>New York,</HI> to the end the benefit of that Trade may be pre&s;erved to the Inhabitants and Traders of <HI>New York</HI> and <HI>Albany,</HI> the &s;ame being agreeable to the Laws of his Maje&s;ties &s;aid Province, and to former Practice as well as nece&s;&s;ary for the collecting of tho&s;e Cu&s;toms and other Duties which are to be rai&s;ed for the &s;upport of His Maje&s;ties Government in his &s;aid Province.</P>
<P>And whereas I am Informed, That notwith&s;tanding of the Declaration of His Maje&s;ties Royal Will and plea&s;ure in the Premi&s;es, the Proprietors and other the Inhabitants of the &s;aid <HI>Ea&s;t New-Jar&s;ey,</HI> do contrary thereunto, endeavour to &s;ettle and e&s;tabli&s;h a Port at <HI>Perth-Amboy,</HI> to the great Ob&s;truction and Decay of the Trade and Revenue of this His Maje&s;ties Province. I have therefore thought fit, by and with the Advice and Con&s;ent of His Maje&s;ties Council, &s;trictly to charge and command his Maje&s;ties Collector and Receiver General of this His Maje&s;ties Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and all Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e-Officers under him, and all other per&s;on and Per&s;ons whom the&s;e Pre&s;ents may or can concern, that all and every of them in their re&s;pective Places and Circum&s;tances, do take effectual care that no Ship or Ve&s;&s;el be &s;uffered or permitted to go unto <HI>Perth-Amboy,</HI> or unto any other Port or Place within the &s;aid <HI>Ea&s;t-New-Jar&s;ey</HI> with any Goods or Merchandize whereon any Duties or Cu&s;toms do ari&s;e by virtue of the Laws of <HI>England</HI> and this Province, without their fir&s;t coming and entring the &s;ame in his Maje&s;ties Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e at New York, and paying there the afore&s;aid Duties e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Laws, as afore&s;aid. And if any Ship or Ve&s;&s;el &s;hall, contrary hereunto, go into any Port or Harbour in the &s;aid <HI>New-Jar&s;ey,</HI> then his Maje&s;ties Collector and Receiver General, or any Officer appointed by him, &s;hall &s;eize and &s;top the &s;ame un|di&s;charged by due cour&s;e of Law. And all Per&s;ons are hereby &s;trictly Charged and Commanded to take Notice hereof accordingly, as they will an&s;wer the contrary at their Peril.</P>
