<HEAD>CHRISTIANITY THE GRAND SOURCE, AND THE SUREST BASIS, OF POLITICAL LIBERTY: A SERMON.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL><HI>II. CORINTHIANS, iii.</HI> 17.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;AND WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS, THERE IS LIBERTY.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN contemplating national advantages, and national happiness, numerous are the ob|jects which present themselves to a wise and reflecting patriot. While he remembers the past, with thankfulness and triumph; and while he looks forward, with glowing anti|cipation, to future glories, he will by no means forget to enquire into the secret springs, which had an active influence in the former, and which, there is reason to believe, will be equally connected with the latter.</P>
<P>THESE ideas naturally arise, in the mind of every American citizen, especially on this
<PB N="8" REF="025823_0006_0FCF27D6C11294F8">
Anniversary of our country's natal hour. While we review, with gratitude and exul|tation, the various steps which have paved the way for our political advancement, we are obviously led to search for the happy principles, which laid at the foundation of these&mdash;And while we suffer fancy to draw aside, for a moment, the veil which covers futurity, and to disclose its bright scenes, we cannot overlook the same objects, on the extension and farther influence of which, we are to build our hopes.</P>
<P>WE have convened, indeed, principally to celebrate the completion of another year of freedom to our western world. We are to keep this day as a memorial of the time which gave rise to the precious privileges we enjoy, as a sovereign and independent people. It may, therefore, be imagined, that our only proper employment, on the pre|sent occasion, is, to take a retrospect of the interesting scenes, which that glorious aera presented to the mind, and to recount the noble atchievements, which, under the di|rection of infinite wisdom, laid the founda|tion of our prosperity and happiness. But
<PB N="9" REF="025823_0007_0FCF27DA1C689928">
why should our chief attention be directed toward these objects? They are objects, in|deed, upon which to gaze, delights and ele|vates the patriotic mind. They are objects, which, to lose sight of, is to forfeit the cha|racter of a faithful citizen. But, at the same time, they are objects too familiar to all pre|sent to need the formality of repetition. I address many of those who were near wit|nesses of these stupendous transactions; and not a few who were agents in the important work. Whose hearts burn within them, at the recollection of events, which the world beheld with amazement: and who view with transport, the political greatness which these events were the means of ushering in, and establishing in our country.</P>
<P>IN an audience of this description, then, where is the necessity of my trespassing on your patience, by a bare recital of what is so well known, and so feelingly remembered? Where is the need of my attempting, with minute care, to call up to your view, the patriotic and wise management of our coun|sels, in those trying times&mdash;the fortitude and enthusiastic ardor of our heroes&mdash;the splen|dor
<PB N="10" REF="025823_0008_0FCF27DBB4B51290">
of our conquests&mdash;or the dignity and glory to which we are exalted by the su|preme Arbiter of nations? Rather let us turn our attention to the grand <HI>Source,</HI> from which we are to expect the long continu|ance, and the happy increase of these inva|luable gifts of heaven.</P>
<P>AND to this choice of a subject I am also led by the recollection, that the respectable SOCIETY to which this discourse is, in a par|ticular manner, addressed, hold up, as the great object of their attention, every thing that may tend to promote the progress of ci|vil liberty, and to transmit it, pure and un|defiled, to the latest posterity. They profess to stand as guardians over those inestimable rights and privileges, which have been so dearly purchased, and, in general, to seek, in every form, the advantage of their country. To an association established upon such lau|dable principles, nothing that is included in these great outlines of their system, can be considered either as foreign to their plan, or beneath their attention. Nothing can be considered entirely inapplicable to their de|signs, in celebrating this auspicious day, that
<PB N="11" REF="025823_0009_0FCF27DCC2F63978">
is, in any degree, connected with the promo|tion of public dignity and happiness.</P>
<P>IT is under this impression, my fellow ci|tizens, that I propose, on the present occasi|on, to offer you a few general remarks on the important influence of the Christian re|ligion in promoting political freedom. And, as the foundation of these remarks, I have chosen the words which have just been read in your hearing.</P>
<P>I am well aware, that these words, taken in their proper sense, have a principal refer|ence to liberty of a different kind from that to which I would accommodate and apply them. They refer to that glorious deliver|ance from the power, and the ignoble chains of sin and satan, which is effected by the Spi|rit of the Lord, in every soul, in which his special and saving influences are found. They point out, also, that release from the bondage of the legal administration, which the gospel affords to all who receive it in sincerity and truth.&mdash;But, as I am persuaded the proposition contained in our text is equally true, whether we understand it as
<PB N="12" REF="025823_0010_0FCF27DE5934CDF8">
speaking of spiritual or political liberty, we may safely apply it to the latter, without in|curring the charge of unnatural perversion.</P>
<P>THE sentiment, then, which I shall deduce from the text, and to illustrate and urge which, shall be the principal object of the present discourse, is, <HI>That the general pre|valence of real Christianity, in any govern|ment, has a direct and immediate tendency to promote, and to confirm therein, political liberty.</HI></P>
<P>THIS important truth may be established, both by attending to the nature of this re|ligion, in an abstract view; and by advert|ing to fact, and the experimental testimony with which we are furnished by history.</P>
<P>THAT the corrupt passions and the vices of men, have, in all ages of the world, been the grand source and support of tyranny, and of every species of political and domes|tic oppression, is a truth too well known, and too generally admitted, to require formal proof, on the present occasion. A mo|ment's reflection on the nature of tyranny, and of those dispositions in the constituent members of society, which lead to its origin
<PB N="13" REF="025823_0011_0FCF27E0E1D09208">
and advancement, is sufficient to convince every unprejudiced mind, that human de|pravity is the life and the foul of slavery. What was it that first raised this monster from the infernal regions, and gave him a dwel|ling among men, but ignorance, on the one hand, and on the other, ambition and pride? These his complotters and associates, pro|ceeding in a state of indissoluble connection, have always held up his deformed head, and wielded his iron rod. Together they have invariably come into being&mdash;together they have lived and flourished&mdash;and into one common grave have they sunk at last.</P>
<P>THE truth is, that political liberty does not rest, solely, on the form of government, under which a nation may happen to live. It does not consist, altogether, in the arrange|ment or in the balance of power; nor even in the rights and privileges which the con|stitution offers to every citizen. These in|deed, must be acknowledged to have a con|siderable effect in its promotion or decline. But we shall find, on a close inspection, that something else is of equal, if not of greater
<PB N="14" REF="025823_0012_0FCF27E3F5ECBBB8">
importance. Cases may easily be conceived, where, without a single material or glaring deficiency in any of these, true and desira|ble liberty may be almost unknown: and, on the other hand, where, under the most wretched organization of government, the substance of freedom may exist and flourish. Human laws are too imperfect, in them|selves, to secure completely this inestimable blessing. It must have its seat in the hearts and dispositions of those individuals which compose the body politic; and it is with the hearts and dispositions of men that Christianity is conversant. When, there|fore, that <HI>perfect law of liberty,</HI> which this ho|ly religion includes, prevails and governs in the minds of all, their freedom rests upon a basis more solid and immoveable, than hu|man wisdom can devise.&mdash;For the obvious tendency of this divine system, in all its parts, is, in the language of its great Author, to bring <HI>deliverance to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to undo thenheavy burthens; to let the op|pressed go free; and to break every yoke.</HI> But to be more particular&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="025823_0013_0FCF27E50447B400">
THE prevalence of real Christianity, tends to promote the principles and the love of political freedom, by the <HI>doctrines</HI> which it teaches, concerning the human character, and the unalienable rights of mankind; and by the <HI>virtues</HI> which it inculcates, and leads its votaries to practice.&mdash;Let us take a hasty view of each of these&mdash;</P>
<P>CAN oppression and slavery prevail among any people who properly understand, and are suitably impressed with, those great Gos|pel truths, that all men are, by nature, equal&mdash;children of the same common Father&mdash;dependent upon the same mighty power, and candidates for the same glorious im|mortality? Must not despotism hide his head in those regions, where the relations of man to man are distinctly realized&mdash;where citizens, of every rank, are consider|ed as a band of brethren, and where the haughty pretensions of family and blood, are viewed in all their native absurdity, and in those odious colours in which this sub|lime system represents them? In short, must not every sentiment, favorable to slavery, be forever banished from a nation, in which,
<PB N="16" REF="025823_0014_0FCF27E6C293CA40">
by means of the benign light of the glori|ous Sun of righteousness, all the human race are viewed as subject to the same great laws, and amenable to the same awful tri|bunal, in the end.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY, on the one hand, teaches those, who are raised to places of authority, that they are not intrinsically greater than those whom they govern; and that all the rational and justifiable power with which they are invested, flows from the <HI>people,</HI> and is dependent on their sovereign pleasure.&mdash;There is a love of dominion natural to every human creature; and in those who are des|titute of religion, this temper is apt to reign uncontrouled. Hence experience has al|ways testified, that rulers, left to themselves, are prone to imagine, that they are a supe|rior order of beings, to obey whom, the ignoble multitude was made, and that their aggrandizement is the principal design of the social compact. But the religion of the Gospel, rightly understood, and cordially embraced, utterly disclaims such unworthy sentiments, and banishes them with abhor|rence from the mind. It contemplates the
<PB N="17" REF="025823_0015_0FCF27EAAFEB5580">
happiness of the community, as the prima|ry object of all political associations&mdash;And it teaches those, who are placed at the helm of government, to remember, that they are called to preside over <HI>equals</HI> and <HI>friends,</HI> whose best interest, and not the demands of selfishness, is to be the object of their first and highest care.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, Christianity, wherever it exerts its native influence, leads every citizen to reverence himself&mdash;to cherish a free and manly spirit&mdash;to think with bold|ness and energy&mdash;to form his principles up|on fair enquiry, and to resign neither his conscience nor his person to the capricious will of men. It teaches, and it creates in the mind, a noble contempt for that abject submission to the encroachments of despo|tism, to which the ignorant and the unprin|cipled readily yield. It forbids us to call, or to acknowledge, any one master upon earth, knowing that we have a Master in Heaven, to whom both rulers, and those whom they govern, are equally accountable. In a word, Christianity, by illuminating the minds of men, leads them to consider
<PB N="18" REF="025823_0016_0FCF27EBC3FCC468">
themselves, as they really are, all <HI>co-ordinate terrestrial princes,</HI> stripped, indeed, of the empty pageantry and title, but retaining the substance of dignity and power. Under the influence of this illumination, how natural to disdain the shackles of oppression&mdash;to take the alarm at every attempt to trample on their just rights; and to pull down, with indignation, from the seat of authority, every bold invader!</P>
<P>BUT again&mdash;The prevalence of Christi|anity promotes the principles and the love of political freedom, not only by the <HI>know|ledge</HI> which it affords of the human charac|ter, and of the unalienable rights of man|kind, but also by the <HI>duties</HI> which it incul|cates, and leads its votaries to discharge.</P>
<P>THE fruits of the spirit are, justice, love, gentleness, meekness, and temperance: Or, in other words, these are among the distin|guished graces and duties, which the Chris|tian system not only commands us constant|ly to regard, but which it creates in the mind, and which are found to prevail, in a greater or smaller degree, in all who sincere|ly adopt it. Now these are unquestionably
<PB N="19" REF="025823_0017_0FCF27ED4F4E0B88">
the grand supports of pure and undefiled Liberty&mdash;They stand equally opposed to the chains of tyranny, and to the licentiousness of anarchy.</P>
<P>IT is a truth denied by few, at the present day, that political and domestic slavery are inconsistent with <HI>justice,</HI> and that these must necessarily wage eternal war&mdash;So that, wherever the latter exists in perfection, the former must fly before her, or fall prostrate at her feet. What, then, would be the hap|py consequence, if that golden rule of our holy religion, which enjoins, that we should do unto all men whatever we would wish that they should do unto us, were universal|ly received and adopted? We should hear no more of rulers plundering their fellow citizens of a single right; nor of the peo|ple refusing that obedience to equitable laws, which the public good requires. We should see no oppressor claiming from his equals, a subjection which they did not owe; nor should we see the latter lifting up their lawless hands, to resent the reasonable re|quisitions of an authority constituted by themselves. In short, were this principle
<PB N="20" REF="025823_0018_0FCF27F18F4C0FB8">
universally to predominate, we should see nothing, on the one side, but demands founded on a sincere regard to the general interest; and, on the other, that ready com|pliance, which promotes the peace and hap|piness of society.</P>
<P>NO less extensively beneficial in its effects on civil liberty, is that pure and refined <HI>be|nevolence,</HI> which the Christian system incul|cates, and establishes in the minds of those who are under its government. Though the constitution of a country be ever so de|fective; yet if every rank of citizens be under the habitual influence of that uni|versal charity and good will, which is one of the distinguished glories of our holy reli|gion, there will freedom substantially flou|rish. To suppose that oppression, with the numerous hell-born woes, which follow in his train, can be cherished in regions, where the mild Spirit of benevolence and love reigns, is to suppose that the most discor|dant principles are capable of uniting; that demons of darkness, and angels of light can dwell together in harmony.&mdash;Impos|sible! Wherever that heavenly temper is sound, which, like the Deity himself, de|lights
<PB N="21" REF="025823_0019_0FCF27F34B7DF888">
in showering down blessings, both on enemies and friends; there will the unali|enable rights of men be acknowledged, and every infringement of them will be viewed with abhorrence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Here it will, perhaps, be objected, that however just these remarks may appear in theory, yet their force is not a little weakened, by ad|verting to the numerous persecutions and wars, to which Christianity has given rise.&mdash;But let it be remembered, that Christianity has been more frequently the more pretext, than the true motive, of those mul|tiplied acts of cruelty and intolerance, which fully the pages of histo|ry. Generally have the offspring of ambition, revenge, or some equally corrupt principle, been attributed to religion, and supposed to have nothing else for their origin. But admitting for a moment, that Christianity has in reality, been the cause of much mischief of this kind; yet it was Christianity shamefully misunderstood, and impiously perverted. It was not the pure and benevolent system of the Gospel, but blind zeal and mad fanaticism.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>NOR let us omit to take notice of the pe|culiar <HI>temperance</HI> and <HI>moderation,</HI> which the Gospel systemenjoins. These are of no less importance, with respect to their influence on political happiness, in general, and espe|cially as they affect the interest of civil li|berty. It is an observation as old as the fact upon which it is founded, that nothing more certainly tends, to subvert the princi+ples of freedom, and abate a laudable en|thusiasm for republican equality, than a de|parture
<PB N="22" REF="025823_0020_0FCF27F4C91977C0">
from that simplicity of manners, and that prevailing moderation, which our reli|gion inculcates and promotes. Ever since the establishment of civil society, the words of the Roman Poet, when speaking of his own country, have been applicable to most great empires&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash; <HI>Saevior armis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Luxuria incubuit, victumque ulcisitur orbem.</HI></L>
<BIBL>JUV.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>BUT for this evil, there is no preven|tive that promises so much success, no cure so effectual, as that which is here presented. Christianity, more powerful than human strength, and more efficacious than human law, regulates the passions, and roots out the corruptions of men. It not only tames the savage breast, and gives a deadly blow to barbarity of manners; but also tends to quench every extravagant thirst for power; to beat down every high thought, that exalt|eth itself against the general good; and to render men contented with those rights which the God of nature gave them. While these dispositions prevail, slavery must stand at an awful distance, bound in chains, and
<PB N="23" REF="025823_0021_0FCF27F82830E8F0">
&mdash;Liberty, fair daughter of the skies! Walk in majestic splendor o'er the land, Breathing her joys around&mdash;</P>
<P>HAVING thus contemplated, in an abstract view, the native tendency of the Christian religion, to promote civil liberty; let us now take our stand with History, that mistress of wisdom, and friend of virtue, who from her exalted station, causes human events to pass in review, before her impartial tribunal.</P>
<P>WHEN we compare those nations, in which Christianity was unknown, with those which have been happily favored with the light of spiritual day, we find ample reason to justify the remarks which have been made. It may be asserted, with few excep|tions, that there never was a regularly orga|nized government, since the foundation of the world, where the true religion was not received, in which political slavery did not hold a gloomy reign.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>To relate the enormities of despotism, and the consequent degra|dation and wretchedness to which human nature has been reduced, in many parts of the globe, would be equally shocking and incredible to an American car. How must the lives and fortunes of men have been trampled upon, among the Mexicans, when, at the dedication of their great temple, we are told they had</HI> 60 <HI>or</HI> 70,000 <HI>human sa|crifices; and that the usual amount of them, annually, was about</HI> 20,000! <HI>See Clavigero's History of Mexico. vol. I. page</HI> 281.</NOTE>&mdash;It has been general|ly
<PB N="24" REF="025823_0022_0FCF27F9C7D53408">
found, indeed, that in proportion as the faint glimmerings of the light of nature, with which Pagan nations were favored, ga|thered strength, and grew in brightness, in the same proportion has something like so|cial freedom been promoted and extended. But these glimmerings have still proved in|adequate to the desirable purpose, of im|parting to their liberty a consistent and per|manent character.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The republics of Greece and Rome must be acknowledged, in some degree, exceptions to this general remark. But even among them, numerous were the instances in which the aspect of their political af|airs bare testimony to their sad want of Christian knowledge.</HI></NOTE> As examples of this truth, you will readily recur to the African and Asiatic kingdoms, not excepting some in other quarters of the globe.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, it may be observed, with equal confidence, and with fewer ex|ceptions, that there never was a government, in which the knowledge of pure and unde|filed Christianity prevailed, in which, at the same time, despotism held his throne with|out
<PB N="25" REF="025823_0023_0FCF27FAC7694720">
controul.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>"Christianity, says Baron Montesquieu, has prevented despot|ism from being established in Ethiopia, notwithstanding the heat of the climate, the largeness of the empire, and its situation in the midst of African despotic states."</HI></NOTE> It is true indeed, that in the Christian world, during those centuries wherein gross superstition reigned, and the truth was buried in darkness, slavery reared his head, and scattered his poison among men. It is true, that then, the cloud of op|pression sat thick and deep over the nations, and the world was threatened with a relapse into ancient barbarity. But when, at the auspicious aera of the reformation, the great source of day rose again upon the benight|ed world; when the true knowledge of the Lord revived, the truth speedily made men free. When, in this splendid and glorious light, they began to see what they were, and what they ought to be; they delayed not to cast off their chains, and to assert their rights, with dignity and independence. This is the light, which ever since those days, has been gradually undermining the throne of tyran|ry in Europe.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>One of the bitterest enemies of Christianity, Mr. Hume, observes, that "the precious sparks of liberty were kindled and preserved by the</HI> Puritans <HI>in England; and that, to this sect, whose principles ap|pear so frivolous, and whose habits so ridiculous, the English owe the whole freedom of their constitution." The unfounded and malicious</HI> reflection <HI>which this passage contains, deserves no comment. The</HI> concession <HI>is worthy of notice, as it is the concession of an adversary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It may also be mentioned, in this place, that out of the 17 provinces of the Low Countries, which groaned under the tyranny of Philip II. only the</HI> 7, <HI>now called the</HI> United Provinces, <HI>which admitted and established the principles of the reformation, succeeded in their attempts to throw off the Spanish yoke. The rest, indeed, made a faint effort to gain their liberty, but failed&punc; and are not, to this day, a free people. A remarkable testimony, that Christianity can only be ex|pected to exert her native influence, and produce the happiest effects, when she appears in her beautiful simplicity, stripped of that gaudy and deforming attire, with which corrupt and ambitious men have ever been disposed to clothe her.</HI></P></NOTE> This is the light, which, ga|thering
<PB N="26" REF="025823_0024_0FCEF03CA2245B40">
strength and refinement, by its pas|sage over the mighty deep, hath kindled a flame in this western world, which, we trust, will continue to blaze, with encreasing brightness, while the Sun and Moon shall endure.</P>
<P>NOR is it political slavery alone, that yields to the mild and benign Spirit of Christianity. Experience has shewn, that domestic slave|ry also flies before her, unable to stand the test of her pure and holy tribunal. After the introduction of this religion into the Ro|man empire, every law that was made, relat|ing
<PB N="27" REF="025823_0025_0FCF27FDF1860250">
to slaves, was in their favor, abating the rigors of servitude, until, at last, all the sub|jects of the empire were reckoned equally free.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>When Pope Gregory the great, who flourished toward the end of the</HI> 6<HI>th century, gave liberty to some of his slaves, he offered this reason for it&mdash;"Cum Redemptor noster, totius Conditor na|turoe, ad hoc propitiatus, humanam carnem volueret assumere, ut divinitatis suoe gratia, dirempto (quo tenebamur captivi) vinculo, pristinoe nos restitueret libertati: satubriter agitur, si homines, quos ab initio liberos natura protulit, et jus gentium jugo substituit servi|tutis, in ed, qud nati fuerant, manumittenti<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> beneficio, libertali red|dantur." Gregor: Magn: ap. Potgiess: lib. iv. c. I. fect. 3. What a triumph is here exhibited, of Christian principles, over the sordid dictates of pride and selfishness! Would to God we could more frequently hear this language, and see corresponding practice, in Christians of the present day!</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>HUMANITY, indeed, is still left to deplore the continuance of domestic slavery, in coun|tries blest with Christian knowledge, and po|litical freedom. The American patriot must heave an involuntary sigh, at the recollection, that, even in these happy and singularly fa|vored republics, this offspring of infernal malice, and parent of human debasement, is yet suffered to reside. Alas, that we should so soon forget the principles, upon which our wonderful revolution was founded!
<PB N="28" REF="025823_0026_0FCF2800ECA5C388">
But, to the glory of our holy religion, and to the honor of many benevolent minds, this monster has received a fatal blow, and will soon, we hope, fall expiring to the ground. Already does he tremble, as if his destruction were at hand.&mdash;With pleasure do we behold many evident presages of the approaching period, when Christianity shall extend her sceptre of benevolence and love over every part of this growing empire&mdash;when oppres|sion shall not only be softened of his rigours; but shall take his flight forever from our land.</P>
<P>THAT happier times, and a more exten|sive prevalence of liberty, are not far distant, there are numerous reasons to believe.&mdash;If so signal and glorious has been the influence of Christianity, in promoting political and domestic freedom, notwithstanding her re|strained and narrow operation among men, what may we not expect, when her domini|on shall become universal? If such have been her trophies, amidst so much opposi|tion, and the continual struggles of contra|ry principles, what may we not indulge the
<PB N="29" REF="025823_0027_0FCF2803F3844B20">
hope of seeing, when her empire shall be co|extensive with terrestrial inhabitants&mdash;when <HI>the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth, as the waters cover the depths of the sea?</HI></P>
<P>THEN, may we not conclude, that univer|sal harmony and love, and as the necessary consequence of these, universal liberty, shall prevail? Then, may we not confidently hope, that oppression shall be as much ab|horred, and as much unknown, as freedom is, at present, in many parts of the globe? That the name of <HI>man,</HI> of whatever nation, or kindred, or people, or tongue, shall then be the signal of brotherly affection:&mdash;When the whole human race, uniting as a band of brethren, shall know no other wishes, than to promote their common happiness, and to glorify their common God:&mdash;When <HI>there shall be nothing to hurt nor destroy in all the holy mountain of God&mdash;when the desart shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose; and when the kingdoms of this world, shall become the king|doms of our Lord, and of his Christ?</HI></P>
<P>IMAGINE not, my fellow citizens, that these are the flights of a vain and disordered
<PB N="30" REF="025823_0028_0FCF2805643D5FD0">
fancy. The sacred volume teaches us to <HI>comfort one another with these words,</HI> and to triumph in the glorious prospect. The Au|thor of truth himself, bids us look forward, with joy and gladness, to&mdash;</P>
<P>"The blest Immanuel's gentle reign;"&mdash;when, <HI>from the rising of the Sun, to the going down thereof, his name shall have free course and be glorified.</HI></P>
<P>To the introduction of these happy days, it seems as if the present time afforded many hopeful preludes. Can we turn our eyes to the European states and kingdoms&mdash;can we behold their convulsive struggles, without considering them as all tending to hasten this heavenly aera? Especially, can we view the interesting situation of our AFFECTIONATE ALLIES, without indulging the delightful hope, that the sparks, which are there seen rising toward heaven, though in tumultuous confusion, shall soon be the means of kind|ling a general flame, which shall illuminate the darkest and remotest corners of the earth, and pour upon them the effulgence of ten|fold glory?</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="025823_0029_0FCF2806C2ABF9A8">
THE splendor of their prospects is, indeed, not altogether unclouded. But, we trust, that every difficulty and disorder will speed|ily vanish, and give place to harmony, and efficient government. We trust, that <HI>He who rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm,</HI> will wield their fierce democracy with his mighty arm&mdash;hush the rude noise of war in their borders&mdash;breathe propitious upon their counsels&mdash;and, in the end, crown their exertions with abundant success.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE glorious structure, which this once oppressed people are employed in erecting, has been assailed by numerous malignant foes. Black, and awfully threatning clouds have hung over it&mdash;the rains have descend|ed&mdash;the floods have poured forth&mdash;the winds have blown&mdash;they have all beat violently upon it; but, as if founded upon a rock, it has yet stood. And we hope it will stand. We hope that, bidding calm defiance to the fury of every tempest, it will continue to rise with increasing greatness, until time shall be no more. Cease, then! ye shortsighted sons of ambition, who would oppose this impor|tant work; ye who delight in oppression,
<PB N="32" REF="025823_0030_0FCF28085CC40768">
and who feed on the miseries and debase|ment of men; cease to imagine, that by your feeble arm, you shall be able to with|stand the Mighty One of Israel!&mdash;Remem|ber, that if this cause be of the Lord, you cannot overcome it; and if, haply, you be found fighting against God, your labors, like those of the unhappy sufferer of old, will but revert upon your own heads.</P>
<P><HI>Let the</HI> haughty <HI>kings of the earth, then, set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord,</HI> and against the work of his hands;&mdash;<HI>He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh&mdash;the Lord will have them in derision.</HI> If this wonderful Revolution be, as we trust, a great link in the chain, that is drawing on the reign of universal harmony and peace; if it be occasioned by christian principles, and be designed to pave the way for their complete establishment, however it may ap|pear to be sullied by irreligion and vice,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The Author is well aware, that, in offering his sentiments, thus freely, on the French Revolution, he stands upon controverted ground. It would, therefore, ill become his</HI> inexperience, <HI>and more particu|larly his</HI> profession, <HI>to enter into the details, or the warmth of this argument. He cannot help thinking, however, that the great pillars of this Revolution rest upon those natural rights of men, which are assumed by the best writers on government; and upon those fundamental principles of religion which the Author of our na|tures has revealed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is objected to this revolution, that it has been stained by vio|lence and inhumanity of the most attrocious and unnecessary kind. Wherever a life has been wantonly destroyed, or other severities un|necessarily inflicted, no one should withhold his censure. But shall we make no distinction between the crimes of an enraged multitude, and the decisions of constituted authorities? or, between the preci|pitancy of a popular assembly, at the crisis of a struggle, and the deliberations of settled government? When a nation, so long distres|sed, lifts her avenging arm and breaks her chains on the heads of her oppressors; when a people make a violent effort, to overturn the mountains of despotism under which they are buried, can we expect perfect wisdom, prudence, and moderation to guide all their exerti|ons? While man remains such a creature as he is, this would be a miracle indeed!</HI></P>
<P><HI>But it will be further asked&mdash;Why, since the great object of this discourse is to establish a natural connection between christianity and political liberty; why, in France, amidst the prevalence of the latter, does the former appear to be so little respected and acknowledged, es|pecially among the principal friends and promoters of the revolution? Why do we not see a remarkable attention to real religion, amidst so many exertions to secure the rights of men? The answer is, that Chris|tianity, considered as a system of principles, in theory, may produce extensive effects, where its special and saving influence is extremely small. Nay, every attentive observer of human affairs, has doubt|less discovered a secret but important operation of these principles, on minds actually despising and rejecting them. The one half of that light, in which infidels boast, as the splendid result of reason alone, is, in fact, the light of revelation; and while they contemn its grand Source, they adopt and use it, in all their religious creeds, and in many of their daily actions. A small extension of this thought, will, perhaps, when applied to the French nation, and to all similar cases, go far toward solving the difficulty in question&mdash;That people may be acting in the light of christian principles, though they know it not, neither regard them. A deliverance from the darkness of superstition, may have led them, at once, to cast off the chains of tyranny, and to renounce even the just restraints of real Christianity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But, after all; is there not reason to hope, that many of the ac|counts which have been circulated in America, respecting the disorder, vice, and contempt of all sacred things, prevalent in France, are to|tally groundless? Is it not possible, that there is much more regulari|ty, decorum, and real religion, in that struggling Republic, than her neighboring enemies, so fond of misrepresentation and calumny, are willing to allow? That many shameful instances of exaggeration have been detected is well known.</HI></P></NOTE> it is the cause of God, and will at last prevail.</P>

which presented themselves from the pas|sage of scripture which was chosen, the first emotions which naturally arise, both from the preceding remarks, and this interesting occasion, are those of gratitude and of praise. Here, happily, our thankfulness as patriots, and our thankfulness as christians, perfectly coincide, and are inseparably con|nected together.</P>
<P>LET us unite, then, in offering our grate|ful acknowledgments, to the Sovereign
<PB N="35" REF="025823_0033_0FCF280FEC56CCB0">
Dispenser of all blessings, that, while many nations are covered with the mantle of darkness and superstition; and in conse|quence of this, are groaning under the yoke of servitude; the Sun of righteousness hath risen upon us, with healing in his wings; and hath taught us, in a political view, to know, and to maintain our proper character. Let us bless his holy name, that, under the influence of this light, we have been led to assert the dignity of human nature&mdash;to throw off the chains of oppression&mdash;to think and act for ourselves, and to acknowledge no other king than the <HI>King of the universe.</HI> Let us bless his name, that, under the gui|dance of the same light, we have been led to frame a constitution, which recognizes the natural and unalienable rights of men; which renounces all limits to human liber|ty, but those which necessity and wisdom prescribe; and whose great object is, the <HI>general good. O give thanks unto the Lord! for he is good; for his mercy endureth for|ever. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the oppressor, and delivered from all their destructions. O that
<PB N="36" REF="025823_0034_0FCF281142ECD338">
men would praise the Lord, for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN; if it be a solemn truth, that the prevalence of Christianity, has a natural and immediate tendency to promote political freedom, then, those are the truest and the wisest patriots, who study to encrease its in|fluence in society. Hence it becomes every American citizen to consider this as the great palladium of our liberty, demanding our first and highest care.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad. The lines are fallen un|to us in pleasant places, yea, we have a goodly heritage.</HI> We possess an extensive, noble country. Fertility and beauty vie with each other, in favor of our ease, accom|modation, and delight. Every avenue to national importance, and the felicity of in|dividuals, is opened wide. Let it, then, in addition to all these advantages, and to complete its glory, let it be Immanuel's land. This will refine, and inconceivably appreci|ate your freedom. This will render you at
<PB N="37" REF="025823_0035_0FCF2812C0E48FB8">
once the pattern, and the wonder of the world.</P>
<P>To each of you, then, my fellow ci|tizens, on this Anniversary of our Inde|pendence, be the solemn address made! Do you wish to <HI>stand fast in that liberty, where|with</HI> the Governor of the universe <HI>hath made you free?</HI> Do you desire the encreasing pros|perity of your country? Do you wish to see the law respected&mdash;good order preserved, and universal peace to prevail? Are you convinced, that purity of morals is necessary for these important purposes? Do you be|lieve, that the Christian religion is the firm|est basis of morality? Fix its credit, then, by adopting it yourselves, and spread its glo|ry by the lustre of your example! And while you tell to your children, and to your children's children, the wonderful works of the Lord, and the great deliverance which he hath wrought out for us, teach them to remember the Author of these blessings, and they will know how to estimate their value. Teach them to acknowledge the God of heaven as their King, and they will despise submission to earthly despots. Teach them to be Christians, and they will ever be free!</P>
