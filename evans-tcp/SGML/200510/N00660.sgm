<P>The la&s;t Lords-Day we were called upon in the word (and that in compliance with &s;uch awful Di&s;pen&s;ations of Divine Providence as were then among us) to mourn &amp; weep, but withal to weep as tho' we wept not; &s;ince which time we have been under &s;uch Di&s;pen&s;ations as call for an Oce|an of Tears, &s;o that there is le&s;s danger of exceed|ing; our great care is (or &s;hould be) le&s;t thro' in|&s;en&s;iblene&s;s of Gods hand we be found &s;hort of our Duty.</P>

<P><HI>Death,</HI> and <HI>Graves,</HI> and <HI>Funeral Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> are of late grown common among us, tho' &s;uch Graves (I confe&s;s) are not common.</P>

Let me without offence allude to a Text in 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.30. where the lo&s;s of <HI>Davids</HI> &s;ide is reckoned up and worded thus [<HI>Nineteen men and A&s;ahel</HI>] And why

not twenty men? Becau&s;e <HI>A&s;ahel</HI> was a man of &s;ingular Worth, and therefore de&s;erved to be na|med &s;ingly, and hence not reckoned in the num|ber of the vulgar, but &s;et by him&s;elf. Among our &s;elves I may &s;ay, we have lo&s;t within the time pre|fixed preci&s;ely the like number, and let it be thus worded [<HI>Nineteen men and Daniel</HI>] A per&s;on that de&s;erved to be di&s;tinctly mentioned, let him &s;tand alone, it being very difficult to find an equal to &s;et by him. It was part of <HI>I&s;raels</HI> Ble&s;&s;ing. (<HI>Numb.</HI> 23 9.) <HI>to dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the Nations.</HI> A <HI>Daniel</HI> he was indeed, <HI>Daniel</HI> &s;ignifies Judgment of God, or Judgment from God, and we may &s;ay &s;o of him two ways, either,</P>
<P>He was a man of <HI>Judgment,</HI> which was given him by God from whom all Wi&s;dom, Prudence and Judgment comes, and he had a large mea&s;ure of it, was a man of great Judgment, Meekne&s;s and Moderation al&s;o, prudent and patient, as all that knew him know.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Judgment of God,</HI> as a man the taking a|way of whom is a great Judgment from God upon us, for &s;o is the removal of the <HI>Prudent</HI> and <HI>Coun&s;el|ler, &amp;c.</HI> accounted (<HI>I&s;a.</HI> 3.1 &mdash;3.)

Thus God takes away &s;uch <HI>of whom the World is not worthy,</HI> and leaves &s;uch among us that are not worthy of a place in the World.</P>
<P>I remember &s;ome of his dying words. <HI>I have</HI>

I neither need nor dare flatter in the ca&s;e. To flatter a man is to &s;peak more good of him than he de&s;erves, a Crime not &s;o ea&s;ily committed upon &s;o worthy a Subject. We may and mu&s;t &s;peak of per&s;ons and things as they be, and of him we may truly &s;ay as <HI>David</HI> &s;aid of <HI>Abner,</HI> 2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 3.38, 39. <HI>Know you not that here is a Prince and great man fallen this Day in I&s;rael, and I am this day weak,</HI> &amp;c.

<P N="1">1. <HI>Men of Prudence and Conduct, are great men</HI>; yea, Princes in a Place. So is <HI>Abner</HI> called, and &s;o was our <HI>Daniel.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Whatever per&s;ons be in them&s;elves, or whatever the Concernment of the place is in them, yet Death will make them fall.</HI> This great man and Prince (&s;aith <HI>David</HI>) is fallen. <HI>Wi&s;e men dye as well as fools. P&s;a.</HI> 49.10. Neither piety nor prudence, nor u&s;efulne&s;s can keep men from falling. Princes and Coun&s;el|lors, the Studs and Staies of a Place mu&s;t fall.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Fall of &s;uch per&s;ons is a weakening to the Survivers.</HI> His Fall made <HI>David</HI> weak.</P>

<P>The Application and Improvement of the&s;e Notes, I leave to the &s;erious hearer, and the Intel|gent <HI>Regarder</HI> of the <HI>Operation of Gods Hand,</HI> who will readily under&s;tand the &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s and &s;ui|tablene&s;s of &s;uch Truths.</P>
<P>But to come to my Text.</P>
<P>This <HI>ver&s;e</HI> is the clo&s;e of the Prophecy of <HI>Daniel,</HI> one of the Children of the Captivity, &amp; a man of great Integrity &amp; Intimacy with God, whom the Lord pre&s;erved in <HI>Babylon,</HI> and (tho' a Captive) made u&s;e of as an eminent In&s;trument in his Hand for the Service of the Church, &amp; for that end ad|vanced him unto great Dignity, made him a chief Ruler, and kept him in his place for the good of his poor people, tho' he had many Enemies, that out of envy and malice watcht for his halting. And be&s;ides that, the Lord was plea&s;ed to be very familiar with him, &amp; acquaint him with much of his mind and will concerning both his pre&s;ent and future Di&s;pen&s;ations in his Providence, both to the Church and the World, as is to be &s;een at large in his Prophecy.</P>
<P>Not to go any further back than this <HI>Chapter,</HI> here is in the Beginning of it a <HI>Revelation</HI> of a Time of great Trouble coming upon his people; &s;uch as had not been &s;ince they were a Nation; (<HI>v.</HI> 1.) with other things that <HI>Daniel greatly de&s;ired</HI> a plainer di&s;covery of, and further &s;atisfaction a|bout,

as not fully under&s;tanding what was &s;aid, &amp; therefore enquired, <HI>v.</HI> 8. but received that An&s;wer <HI>v.</HI> 9. that the words were <HI>Sealed till the Time of the End,</HI> and therefore willed him to <HI>go his way,</HI> and adds that <HI>many &s;hould be tried, and that the wi&s;e &s;hould under&s;tand, &amp;c.</HI> and annexes &s;omething (tho' dark|ly too) concerning the Time of the end. <HI>v.</HI> 10, 11, 12. about which he had enquired.

<P>The People of God that have a pro&s;pect of Evil to come, are very much concerned there about, &amp; &s;o was he, but God gave him this word of Con&s;o|lation, which is of u&s;e to all other in like Condition.</P>

<P><HI>Until the End] i. e.</HI> until thy End, which is quickly coming, or which thou ha&s;t but a little way to; go about thy Bu&s;ine&s;s till thou come to the end of thy Bu&s;ine&s;s, be not over &s;olicitous a|bout tho&s;e future events, nor di&s;tractingly thought|ful about what &s;hall fall out.

<P><HI>Thou &s;halt re&s;t</HI>] Sometimes God gives his Emi|nent Servants a particular Exemption from future Trouble, tho' they live in the Time of it, they &s;hall not &s;hare in it; he finds <HI>Chambers of Provi|dence to hide them in</HI> (I&s;a. 26.20.) we hear con|cerning <HI>Noah, Daniel</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> what &s;hall be their per&s;onal Lott in trouble&s;ome Times; tho' they &s;hall <HI>Save neither Son nor Daughter,</HI> yet them&s;elves &s;hall e&s;cape. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14.14, 16. But this &s;eems not to be the meaning here, rather it refers to the end of his life, that he &s;hould re&s;t in the Grave which is given in Scripture as the common place of cer|tain Re&s;t to all the Saints. See <HI>Rev.</HI> 14.13. with <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 57.2. &s;o <HI>Job</HI> calls the Grave a <HI>re&s;ting place.</HI> Job 3.17, 18. and probably <HI>Daniel</HI> was now near the end of his life, drawing on toward the Even|ing of his Day, ready to be put into the <HI>Bed</HI> of his <HI>Grave,</HI> there to take his <HI>Re&s;t.</HI></P>

<P>The taking away of pious ones is the bringing them to re&s;t till the End of Time when they &s;hall &s;tand up in their Lott.</P>

<P>This was the ca&s;e in the <HI>Text,</HI> unparallel'd Evil was coming, <HI>v.</HI> 1. and now <HI>go thy way Daniel.</HI> I&s;a. 57.1, 2. is a plain Confirmation thereof. Scripture In&s;tances abound for the proof of it: <HI>Methu&s;elah</HI> dyed ju&s;t before the Flood. <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> was to go to his Grave in peace before the threatned Calamities came. 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 34.28. <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was to have <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> in his Dayes, and the Judgments &s;poken of not to come till he was gone. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 39.6, 7, 8.</P>
<P>Daily Examples al&s;o confirm it.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons are,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>From the great love of God to his Children to call them home before Trouble comes.</HI> A tender Father &amp; Mother will do &s;o by their Children; call them in when the night is drawing on, or when a Storm is ri&s;ing.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From the Saints them&s;elves,</HI> whom the Lord may find ripe, and &s;o hou&s;e them before a Storm, their work may be fini&s;hed, and &s;o he calls them off, to give them their Reward.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>For warning to the wicked,</HI> and as a means to awaken them, if ought may prevail, or el&s;e to leave them without excu&s;e.</P>

takes away &s;uch Props that they leaned on. When <HI>Chariots</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;emen,</HI> Studs and Pillars are remov|ed, it's time then to look to, &amp; lean upon the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>From God him&s;elf,</HI> who hereby di&s;covers his <HI>Soveraignty</HI> in taking and leaving when he plea&s;es. <HI>His Wi&s;dom</HI> in having other ways to carry on his work than we can think of. <HI>His Power</HI> in rai&s;ing up other In&s;truments when he plea&s;es.</P>

<P><HI>U&s;e</HI> 2. <HI>Then Death is not &s;o dreadful to the People of God as it is repre&s;ented and &s;uppo&s;ed u&s;ually to be.</HI> If it be their Re&s;t, or that which gives them a Pa&s;&s;age or Entrance into Re&s;t, it is a very plea&s;ant, &s;weet, de&s;irable and comfortable thing.</P>
<P>It's true, Death is indi&s;pen&s;ibly the Lot of all, and made &s;o by Divine Appointment; (<HI>Heb</HI> 9.27.) and it is to <HI>Nature</HI> very irk&s;ome, and unto <HI>&s;inning Nature</HI> terrible and affrighting, but to them that are in Chri&s;t, and &s;o have their &s;ins pardoned, &amp; the <HI>Sting of Death</HI> removed, it &s;hould not be &s;o.

<P><HI>U&s;e</HI> 3. <HI>Then be not over much troubled at the removal of any of our pious Friends whom God has taken away by Death, they are but gone to Rest, and why &s;hould that grieve us?</HI> When per&s;ons are &s;ick or di&s;ea&s;ed and weak, one of the principal things we are &s;olicitous about in their behalf is that they may take their <HI>Re&s;t,</HI> when their eyes have been long held waking, O how do we wi&s;h for them that they might take their <HI>Re&s;t,</HI> we make all quiet &amp; &s;till, &s;uffer no noi&s;e nor any di&s;turbance that might hinder them of their <HI>Re&s;t</HI>; and if we can &s;ee them take their <HI>Re&s;t,</HI> we hope they &s;hall do well.

It is the <HI>Righteous man,</HI> who when he dyes <HI>enters into his Bed, &amp; Re&s;ts in his Grave,</HI> (I&s;a. 57.1, 2.) The Securing to thy &s;elf that thou art one of the&s;e will &s;ecure the other.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="000802_0026_0FAA4A14AE1A23A8">More particularly take the&s;e three Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1 If thou woulde&s;t go to Re&s;t when thou dye&s;t, <HI>See that a State of Sin which is a State of Nature be made a Re&s;tle&s;s &s;tate to thee</HI>: See that thou be not able to re&s;t in Sin, or in any thing in this World; &s;ee that nothing un|der the Sun quiet or give thee re&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e whom God brings to re&s;t when they dye, are &s;uch as were di&s;re&s;ted while alive, driven out of all fal&s;e Re&s;ts that Sinners take up withal in the World. Some re&s;t in one thing, &s;ome in another. Some cannot re&s;t un|le&s;s they Sin or have done &s;ome mi&s;chief: Some rejoyce in Iniquity, &s;ome re&s;t in the Abundance of the World, fill their Barns &amp; Bags, and then go to re&s;t; &s;ome get a Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Godline&s;s, a Name to live, they hear, read, pray, <HI>&amp;c</HI> and therein they re&s;t, their Priviledges, their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s is the <HI>Rest</HI> of many. But the Lords way to give <HI>Re&s;t</HI> is fir&s;t by di&s;quieting and di&s;re&s;ting them in till he brings them out of all other things that &s;o he may bring them to the true <HI>Re&s;t.</HI> Sin &s;hall give thee no Re&s;t, no nor the World, nor any thing therein. If the Lord intend to bring thee to re&s;t, an Unregenerate E&s;tate &s;hall be an unquiet State to thee, thou &s;halt find no re&s;t to the Sole of thy foot, while in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, no re&s;t till got into the Ark, the only place of Re&s;t If ever God give thee Re&s;t, Sin &s;hall be a meer <HI>Slavery</HI> &amp; <HI>Bondage</HI> to thee, wor&s;e than E|gyptian Bondage, under which he will make thee to groan and &s;igh and cry till he bring thee out. He will make indwelling Sin, out-breaking Sin, Original Sin, actual Sin, a burden to thee too heavy for thee to bear, if ever he give thee Re&s;t. This know, that one of the next Mercies to Chri&s;t, and a Preparatory Mercy in order to the giving of Chri&s;t &amp; Re&s;t in him, is to di&s;re&s;t in Sin, and for want of Chri&s;t; nor will he ever bring any to Re&s;t but in this way. And thou mu&s;t be &s;o di&s;quieted about Sin, that all
<PB N="28" REF="000802_0027_0FAA4A1564BD9808">
the World cannot quiet thee, neither plea&s;ures, profits, honours, company, bu&s;ine&s;s; no nor thy Duties, Prayers, Tears, own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hall be able to give thee Re&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Being thus weary, labouring and re&s;tle&s;s, <HI>Come to Christ at his Call,</HI> and his Promi&s;e is, that <HI>he will give thee Re&s;t</HI> (Mat. 11.28.) Oh! make that thy bu&s;ine&s;s (as our <HI>Daniel</HI> who&s;e Death we are bewailing, &s;aid he had done) to &s;ecure an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and there is Re&s;t. Faith in Chri&s;t will give thee true Re&s;t. Faith &s;tabli&s;hes and &s;ixeth the Heart. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 112. Faith in his Power, Pro|mi&s;e, Will. And be &s;ure thou make Chri&s;t not only the <HI>Refuge,</HI> but the <HI>Re&s;t</HI> of thy Soul, which no Hypocrite does or can do; &s;ay of him and to him, <HI>I have none but thee</HI>: he who&s;e heart can &s;ay, <HI>None but Chri&s;t, none but Christ,</HI> &s;hall have him and in him Re&s;t here, and with him ever|la&s;ting Re&s;t hereafter. Make u&s;e of all Bereavements, di&s;quietments, troubles here to make thee hie away to Chri&s;t for Re&s;t. The poor <HI>Dove</HI> found nothing but Wa|ter all over the face of the Earth, and could not be quiet till gotten to the Ark, where <HI>Noah</HI> was ready to put forth his hand and pull her in. This World hath alwayes been, though at &s;ome times more than other, it is a trou|bled Sea, there is nothing but in&s;table Water; uncertain comforts, certain di&s;quietments; let this Serve to make Chri&s;t Precious, with whom is certain Re&s;t.</P>
<P>And the rea&s;on why tho&s;e that get into Chri&s;t &s;hall re&s;t is becau&s;e he takes away Sin the only cau&s;e of di&s;re&s;t, Sin the &s;ting of Death, and then <HI>Death cannot &s;eparate from the Love of Chri&s;t,</HI> and where that is mu&s;t needs be Re&s;t. He that hath &s;een Chri&s;t and in him obtained Salvation from Sin, he may <HI>depart in peace,</HI> and &s;hall <HI>goe to Re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Then follow Je&s;us Christ &V;niver&s;ally, Laboriou&s;ly in all the wayes of New Obedience</HI>; and that will carry thee to
<PB N="29" REF="000802_0028_0FAA4A1662898998">
Re&s;t. Tho&s;e only that followed the Lord fully entered into Re&s;t, and had a Lott in <HI>Canaan,</HI> and they were only two of the Congregation, <HI>Numb.</HI> 14 24 with 32.12. If you would Re&s;t when you dye, work hard for Chri&s;t while you live. <HI>The Re&s;t of a Labouring man is &s;weet</HI>; then labour with all your might, and that will both &s;e|cure your Re&s;t and make it Sweet. And indeed it is a bui&s;y World in which we are, here is a great deal of work, much bu&s;ine&s;s to be done for Chri&s;t, none need &s;tand &s;tiil for want of work, and none &s;hall re&s;t but tho&s;e that did work. Lazy, idle, &s;lothful Sinners &s;hall never goe to re&s;t: Idlene&s;s tends to di&s;re&s;t, but all regular la|bour and motion leads to re&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>And the nearer we come to our end the more vigorou&s;ly let us move toward our re&s;t.</HI> Its ob&s;erved of natural Motions the nearer the Centre the Swifter, &s;o let it be with Chri&s;ti|ans. Are there any of us Aged and Gray-headed, do we &s;ee the Time of our Di&s;&s;olution drawing nigh, are the Shadows of the Evening &s;tretcht out upon us, then let us lift up our feet, put on, mend our pace, the Grave is in view, we walk &amp; work in the &s;ight of our Re&s;ting place, and that &s;hould quicken us. It is the la&s;t day of the Week with many of us, and toward the evening of that al&s;o, and then comes the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> the <HI>Rest,</HI> the con|&s;tant, eternal re&s;t of labouring Believers, tho&s;e who have been working, their <HI>Works follow them</HI> and yield them <HI>Re&s;t.</HI> And if the Lord help us now to believe, and that with &s;uch a Faith as works by Love, we not only &s;hall, but already <HI>doe enter into Re&s;t.</HI> Heb. 4.3. Troubles in the World we &s;hall have, but peace and re&s;t in Chri&s;t. Sin di&s;turbs, fle&s;h makes us groan, bodily di&s;ea&s;es afflict us, toyl &amp; travel in the World tire us, evil Tidings make us afraid, and fears of wor&s;e di&s;quiet us, but &s;till this Re&s;t remains &s;ure. And know that there is a voice of
<PB N="30" REF="000802_0029_0FAA4A16E7E760B8">
Chri&s;t in every trouble, lo&s;s, bereavement, is that we come to him for Re&s;t, he is Father, Mother, Wife, and he is the only Husband in who&s;e Hou&s;e we &s;hall find Re&s;t. Oh! let all the Sorrowful, bereaved ones that are ready to &s;ay with him (Jer. 45.3.) <HI>Wo is me, I faint and find no Re&s;t</HI>; I &s;ay, let all &s;uch hear Chri&s;t &s;aying, <HI>Come to me and take my Yoke on you and walk</HI> with, and work for me, and <HI>you &s;hall find Re&s;t.</HI> Hearken to this Invitation unto <HI>Re&s;t,</HI> which <HI>Faith</HI> leads to the begin|ning of, <HI>Obedience</HI> helps to a progre&s;s in, and <HI>Death</HI> will bring to the full Accompli&s;hment of. And <HI>let us follow them who through Faith and Patience doe inherit the Promi|&s;es</HI>: and for our Imitation, let me Commend to you &s;ome of the Excellencies found in this <HI>Daniel</HI> of whom the Text &s;peaks, and there were not none of them wanting in our <HI>Daniel,</HI> who&s;e Death we are lamenting.</P>
<P>He is noted for a man of <HI>Great Wi&s;dom and Prudence,</HI> (Chap 1.) <HI>The Fear of God is the beginning of Wi&s;dom,</HI> and the Lord has directed all that want Wi&s;dom to ask it.</P>
<P>He was a man of a <HI>Tender Con&s;cience,</HI> afraid of defile|ing him&s;elf with the Portion of the Kings meat. Oh! get and keep a Tender Con&s;cience, e&s;pecially in dange|rous, tempting and defiling times; a <HI>Tender Con&s;cience,</HI> e&s;pecially where there is an inlightened under&s;tanding, and sound Judgment, is a choice Mercy.</P>
<P>Again, He was a man <HI>not given to Appetite,</HI> but one who&s;e <HI>Moderation</HI> was eminently obvious, he could con|tent him&s;elf with <HI>Pul&s;e</HI> &amp; <HI>Water,</HI> when he might have had Wine and fle&s;h.</P>
<P>A man <HI>much in Prayer,</HI> e&s;pecially in <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> from which Duty <HI>three Times a day,</HI> the Kings Edict, and Dan|ger of being devoured by <HI>Lyons</HI> could not deterr him, yea was conver&s;ant al&s;o in <HI>Fasting and Prayer.</HI> A man of

<P>He was a <HI>Thankful man,</HI> as well as a Praying man. See <HI>Chap</HI> 2. &amp; 7.</P>
<P>A very <HI>Humble, &s;elf-denying man</HI>; &s;till gave God the Glory of ought that was done by him: <HI>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy Name be the Prai&s;e,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 115.1. So he <HI>Chap.</HI> 2.28, 30. <HI>God revealeth Secrets, and it is not for my Wi&s;dom,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>above others.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He was not lifted up by his great Advancement,</HI> &s;o as to forget his God, him&s;elf, or his bu&s;ine&s;s; one of the fir&s;t or be&s;t of tho&s;e few that was not the wor&s;e for Worldly greatne&s;s or advancement, lo&s;t nothing of his Religion by his preferment.</P>
<P><HI>An Exact and Circum&s;pect walker</HI>; much afraid and &s;hy of Sin, and &s;o punctual and prudent in his Carriage, as that they could find nothing again&s;t him, &s;ave in the matter of his God, though he was miliciou&s;ly and curi|ou&s;ly watch't; he was a man that had obtained an An|&s;wer to that Prayer, <HI>Lord, lead me in a plain path becau&s;e of mine ob&s;ervers.</HI> And indeed his being &s;o mucn in Com|munion with God help't him to be &s;o harmle&s;s &amp; blame|le&s;s, like one of the Sons of God among men, though in the mid&s;t of a Crooked &amp; Perver&s;e Generation.</P>
<P>He was <HI>much concerned for the Church of God</HI>; &s;o was good <HI>Nehemiah</HI> al&s;o.
