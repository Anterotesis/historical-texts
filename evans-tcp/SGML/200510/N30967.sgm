</FIGURE> CANADA SUBJECTED. &mdash;A New Song.&mdash;</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BRAVE Soldiers all, both far and near,</L>
<L>Lay by your Swords and never fear:</L>
<L>For now the Battle being o'er,</L>
<L>The thund'ring Cannon cea&s;e to roar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lay by the Trumpet and the Drum;</L>
<L>For joyful Days at la&s;t are come,</L>
<L>And CANADA is all our own,</L>
<L>And &s;ubject to great GEORGE's Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>Savages</HI> lay down their Arms.</L>
<L>The <HI>French</HI> do cea&s;e to rai&s;e Alarms.</L>
<L>Now CANADA is fallen down</L>
<L>Before the Troops of GEORGE's Crown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great was the Day of our Succe&s;s,</L>
<L>When Heav'n our Ho&s;ts was pleas'd to ble&s;s.</L>
<L>When proud <HI>Quebec</HI> and <HI>Montreal</HI></L>
<L>A Prey to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troops did fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let martial Mu&s;ic &s;ound no more;</L>
<L>We have no Foes upon the Shore:</L>
<L>But now we joyfully will &s;ing,</L>
<L>And drink a Health to GEORGE our King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We'll beat our Swords into Plough-&s;hares,</L>
<L>And into Pruning-hooks our Spears;</L>
<L>And bloody Fighting we'll deny,</L>
<L>And follow hone&s;t Hu&s;bandry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rejoice, O <HI>Youth!</HI> the ri&s;ing Age,</L>
<L>May you not need in War 't engage;</L>
<L>May ev'ry Thing &s;ucceed &s;o well,</L>
<L>That Peace with you may ever dwell!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold the bloody Sons of <HI>Gaul!</HI></L>
<L>Rejoice with Trembling at their Fall.</L>
<L>The Blood which cruelly they &s;hed</L>
<L>Has fall'n on their own guilty Heads.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some Time ago their Joy was loud,</L>
<L>And CANADA grew very proud;</L>
<L>While we were mourning in Di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>With Widows and the Fatherle&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We've took their Towns, and &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s</L>
<L>Their Pa&s;tures and the Wilderne&s;s.</L>
<L>Triumphant News &s;preads thro' the Land,</L>
<L>That we have got the Upper-hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye holy Prophets now rejoice,</L>
<L>And ye GOD's Saints that hear his Voice;</L>
<L>Becau&s;e the Lord hath &s;aved you</L>
<L>From In&s;ults of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Crew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With them was found the Blood of Slain,</L>
<L>And on their Robes there was a Stain;</L>
<L>They drunken were with Chri&s;tian Blood,</L>
<L>Which flowed down like as a Flood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, happy Day!&mdash;the blu&s;hing Morn</L>
<L>With Plea&s;ure may our Souls adorn,</L>
<L>When proud <HI>Montreal</HI> became a Prey;</L>
<L>We'll ever ble&s;s the glorious Day!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! when will come the happy Hour,</L>
<L>Which will de&s;troy all <HI>Babel</HI>'s Pow'r!</L>
<L>When will the ble&s;&s;ed Morning come,</L>
<L>When <HI>Babylon</HI> receives her Doom!&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Time in Ha&s;te is coming on,</L>
<L>The End of haughty <HI>Babylon:</HI></L>
<L>The joyful Cry &s;hall quickly be,</L>
<L>"She's like a Stone &s;unk in the Sea!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Time will come, when Pope and Fry'r</L>
<L>Shall both be roa&s;ted in the Fire;</L>
<L>When the proud <HI>Antichri&s;tian</HI> Whore</L>
<L>Will &s;ink, and never <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> more.</L>
