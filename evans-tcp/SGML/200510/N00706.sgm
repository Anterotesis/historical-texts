<P>THat your Honours Re&s;pondant, pur&s;uant unto his Maje&s;ties Writ to him directed, did make a true and ju&s;t Return of the Per&s;ons that were truly elected by the Free-holders and Free-men of the &s;aid City, according to the Tenor of the &s;aid Writ, which is verified by the Electors of the &s;aid Per&s;ons, by an Indenture under the Hands and Seals of the &s;aid Electors or Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, according as the Statutes of the 8th and 10th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th do direct.</P>
<P>That your Honours Re&s;pondant, according to the purport of the &s;aid Writ, did &s;ummons the Free-holders of the County of <HI>Orange,</HI> which he conceived by the Writ to him directed, to be within his Baylwick; but the Mayor, and other of the Magi|&s;trates of the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> together with &s;everal other of the Citizens of the &s;aid City, alledging it to be an Infringement upon the Right of the &s;aid City, to admit any Per&s;ons of a Forreign County to be Chu&s;ers or Electors of the four Re|pre&s;entatives, which by the fir&s;t Con&s;titution of A&s;&s;emblies in this Province were allotted and appropriated to <HI>New-York</HI>; and that they conceived, That the Writ could not change the Fundamental Con&s;titution of the Government, which is con|firmed by Act of A&s;&s;embly. Therefore he, with the Advice &amp; Con&s;ent of the majority of the Electors, did not admit of the Free-holders of <HI>Orange County</HI> to vote, but their Names to be put in a Li&s;t by them&s;elves, that what may be offered again&s;t the Right of the City, might be better con&s;idered afterwards, if there &s;hould be any need of di&s;puting the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Your Honours Re&s;pondant, for the ju&s;t ob&s;erving of his Duty, by the afore&s;aid Writ required, he did in open Field, after the Publication of his Writ, appoint twelve of the Electors to be Witne&s;&s;es of the faithful Execution of his Writ, if an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Controver&s;ie &s;hould ari&s;e about tho&s;e that were elected to &s;erve in A&s;&s;embly, and required ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tne&s;s the Truth of his Execution of the &s;aid Writ, who&s;e Names are hereunto annexed; which Electors were approved of by the Candidates of either Party.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Re&s;pondant on the &s;aid twelfth Day of <HI>May,</HI> according to the Reque&s;t of the Electors, that were then in the Field, upon the Nomination of &s;everal Candidates that were propo&s;ed to repre&s;ent the &s;aid Electors in A&s;&s;embly, did agree to the Poll that was demanded, but the Di&s;order of the People was &s;o great, and the little con|veniency in the Field for the taking the &s;aid Poll, did adjourn the &s;ame to the Town Hall of the &s;aid City, as he humbly conceives by the afore&s;aid Statutes, he hath Power
<PB N="3" REF="000852_0003_0FABA189F55B2A18">
to do; the appointing of the Time and Place of Election, by the &s;aid Writ, being wholly left to the Di&s;cretion of the Sheriff, and by the Command of the Law he needed not the Con&s;ent of any Per&s;on to joyn with him in the Adj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ment of the &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to the Town Hall, becau&s;e he is authorized, both by the Statute-Law and Cu&s;toms of <HI>England</HI> to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Your Honours Re&s;pondant doth further &s;ay, That he did not refu&s;e any of the Candidates to be pre&s;ent at the taking of the Poll, nor was he abu&s;ive to an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of them&punc; but the Candidates of one &s;ide being only pre&s;ent, and one of them &s;o Rude as to take his Chair from him, he did thereupon rebuk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;aid Candidate, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id him get out of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hair, who replyed, <HI>He had mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e right to be there than this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI>; which he al&s;o conceives to be a Violence to the Right of his Office, which makes him the &s;ole Judge of the Poll, as the Statutes do expre&s;s at large, there being none inve&s;ted with the Power of an Oath but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And as for the Witne&s;&s;es that were appointed for the Scrutiny the Poll, and the returning of the Per&s;ons elected, they were the mo&s;t Reputable I could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame on either &s;ide, on behalf of the Candid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tes, and they were under no Re&s;triction, but had the freedom of their Judgment, without any Impo&s;ition; and if Truth &s;wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed or con|vinced them to be in the right, I hope it will not be imputed as a blame to me, &s;ince I have taken all the care imaginable faithfully to di&s;charge my Duty.</P>
<P>And as for the Reproachful Allegation of the Petitioners, <HI>That they had the majority of Votes,</HI> the Return under the Hands and Seals of the Electors, will evidence it to be gro&s;ly fal&s;e; for in the Examination or &s;crutiny of the Poll, the Rules ob&s;erved and agreed by the Witne&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were &s;uch, That no Per&s;on &s;hould be admitted to elect on either &s;ide, but &s;uch as had a Freedom Free-hold in the City or County, or enrolled Free-men, and were of Age, Natural born Subjects, Denizens or Naturalized, and that all tho&s;e that were A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ens, under Age, or had not their Freedoms, or were not enrolled, nor had any Free-hold, &s;hould not have the liberty of Choice. Whereupon the Witne&s;&s;es, upon the &s;crutiny, did refu&s;e forty eight Per&s;ons that were in the Poll, in right of tho&s;e that I returned, and excluded them from their Vote; and upon the &s;crutiny of the Candidates of the Petitioners, there were in like manner eighty eight Per&s;ons refu&s;ed, who according to the agreement afore&s;aid, were not qualified to give their Votes; and time was allowed for the Per&s;ons excepted to ju&s;tifie their Right of Voting, if any they had, which not being done, they were excluded; by which means, at the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;ing of the &s;crutiny, there did appear to be Fifty Eight Electors more for tho&s;e that I have returned, than there were in favour of the other Candidates, or the Contumelious Petitioners. And there being but twenty one of the Free-holders of <HI>Orange</HI> County, who did Vote, if they had been allowed by the City, yet &s;till there &s;hould be Thirty Seven more Votes for tho&s;e whom I did Return by my inden|tures, &s;ealed and lawfully executed by &s;even of the principal Free-holders of the &s;aid City. Which Return I know to be ju&s;t and true, and thereupon, according to my Oath and Duty I did it, and am ready, upon the Oathes of the Witne&s;&s;es to make appear. And therefore humbly pray to be from this <HI>Calumnious</HI> and <HI>Vexatious Complaint</HI> di&s;mi&s;t.</P>

<P>IN Obedience to his Majesties Writ to me directed, for the Election of two Repre|&s;entatives to &s;erve for the &s;aid County in General A&s;&s;embly, I gave publick Notice, according to u&s;ual Method, That on the fifth Day of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, was the time appointed by me for the &s;aid Election&punc; and accordingly at the place appointed the Free-holders appeared, and after I had publi&s;hed his Maje&s;ties Writ at the time appointed, I de&s;ired them to proceed in their Choice. Whereupon Capt. <HI>John Drake</HI> and Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> Sub&s;tantial Freeholders of the &s;aid County, were named as Candidates, and no other Per&s;on what&s;oever was put up, &s;o that the Election was <HI>Nimine Contradicente.</HI> 'Tis true, &s;ome of the Free-holders of &s;aid County cryed out, <HI>VVe prote&s;t against the Election,</HI> but offered no Rea&s;on why, neither, as is already &s;aid, did they name any other Candidate, neither were they a third part of the Free-holders there met together to make the &s;aid Election; &s;o that in my humble Opinion the Repre&s;entatives returned by me to &s;erve in G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">neral A&s;&s;embly, were fairly and duely elected, and accordingly the Witne&s;&s;es appointed to &s;ee that the Election was fair, &s;igned the Indentures.</P>
<P>And whereas the &s;aid Complainants have declared, <HI>That &s;everal Per&s;ons that voted for the &s;aid Repre&s;entatives returned, were not Free-holders of the &s;aid County</HI>; which is a Columnious A&s;&s;ertion, as will appear by the Names of the Free-holders that made the &s;aid Election. That any Artifices were u&s;ed to di&s;turb and hinder the Freedom of the Choice, is wholly erronious And the time appointed for the &s;aid Election was at ten of the Clock in the Fore-noon of the &s;aid 5<HI>th</HI> day of <HI>May,</HI> at which hour the Free-holders of the &s;aid County met upon the Green (the place appointed) and elected the &s;aid Per&s;ons returned; and that there might be no di&s;pute for want of time, it was about 4 or 5 a Clock in the after-noon before the Indentures of the &s;aid Return were &s;igned. So that that A&s;&s;ertion of the &s;aid <HI>Jo&s;iah H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt, &amp;c.</HI> in their Petition alledged, is nothing but Vexatious. So that I am humbly of Opinion, I have made a due Return of his Maje&s;ties Writ, and acted nothing in the &s;aid Election but what is according to Law. And that I, with the Witne&s;&s;es of the &s;aid Election, are ready to te&s;tifie the Truth of this An&s;wer upon Oath. Therefore I humbly de&s;ire the honourable Hou&s;e, That I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e di&s;mi&s;t from the &s;aid Contumelious and Vexatious Complaint.</P>
