<HEAD>REMARKS ON THE LETTER ADDRESSED TO TWO GREAT MEN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL not inquire who is the Author of the Piece on which I am going to remark. Your Opinions, and your Arguments, are all that I &s;hall con&s;ider. Whether you are, or ever have been <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. P. 2. of the Letter.</NOTE> pen&s;ioned and employed, whether you are merely a private Man, or a Per&s;on di&s;tingui&s;hed in Rank and Fortune, you are to me, and to the Public, on this Occa&s;ion, only the Author of the Letter to Two Great Men; and you will give me Leave to addre&s;s you in that, and in no other Light. It is indeed a Light in which you cannot be viewed to your Di&s;advantage; your Piece is animated with the Spirit of true Patrioti&s;m; it di&s;covers political and hi&s;torical Knowledge; and is written through|out with Fire and Energy.</P>
<P>But, Sir, that Animation of Language and Sen|timent, which is allowed to the Orator in political Conflicts <HI>in pulvere et in &s;ole,</HI> has no Place in a &s;ober Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. I write not to the Ear or to the Pa&s;|&s;ions;
<PB N="6" REF="008751_0004_102FDA9DCCEA84C0">
I aim at no Seduction of Judgment; and I a&s;k for no Approbation but what a Calm Reflection and unprejudiced Rea&s;on may afford me. My End is, rather to examine the Ju&s;tne&s;s of your Plan, than to enforce any Plan of my own&punc; and I &s;hall not af|fect the Flow, nor the Pomp, nor the high-colour|ing of parliamentary Declamation. If I can deliver a plain Argument in plain Language, it is all I aim at: For this I &s;hall make no Apology; that Free|dom with which you warn the Mini&s;try again&s;t fall|ing into Mi&s;takes in the en&s;uing Treaty of Peace, will ju&s;tify me to you, and to the World, if I &s;hould attempt to point out &s;ome of tho&s;e Mi&s;takes, into which I imagine you are your&s;elf fallen.</P>
<P>You cannot be ignorant in what Manner Succe&s;s operates upon the Minds of Men; with what a blind and haughty Confidence it in&s;pires them; and in the in&s;olent Elation of Victory, how little they attend to Rea&s;on or Ju&s;tice, and often to their own mo&s;t important Intere&s;ts. People of all Nations imagine, that when they are wor&s;ted, Succe&s;s gives their E|nemy very little Right to pre&s;cribe &s;evere Terms; and conceive when they are them&s;elves &s;ucce&s;sful, that there are no Bounds to their own Preten&s;ions. If this Di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould happen at this Time to prevail among&s;t us, it may be attended with very pernicious Con&s;equences. It may rai&s;e &s;uch extra|vagant Expectations, or excite &s;uch wrong-placed De&s;ires, as will render a Negotiation for Peace a Work of infinite Difficulty. A virtuous and able Mini&s;try may, in &s;ome Sort, find their Virtue and Ability brought to act again&s;t them&s;elves; they may find that their Victories and Succe&s;&s;es have excited &s;o much Arrogance in tho&s;e who had [no Share in acquiring them, as to de&s;troy all their Effects; they may find their Virtue and Moderation over|ruled by the Madne&s;s of the People, and be thus
<PB N="7" REF="008751_0005_102FDA9F557028C0">
di&s;abled from availing them&s;elves of a &s;ucce&s;sful War, in the Attainment of an advantageous Peace.</P>
<P>I am afraid, Sir, that your Letter tends to in|crea&s;e and inflame this improper Di&s;po&s;ition. You are not to be blamed for delivering your Sentiments openly. The Liberty of an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and your own Abilities, give you a Right to do &s;o. What I blame is your exce&s;&s;ive Attachment to certain Ob|jects, &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that if they &s;hould not be in&s;i&s;ted upon by the Mini&s;try, with a Warmth equal to your own, you he&s;itate not to declare to the People, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. P. 29. of the Letter.</NOTE> <HI>that we &s;hall have a treacherous and delu&s;ive Peace.</HI> This, Sir, is &s;urely a mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable Method of proceed|ing; it is to &s;ow the Seeds of general Di&s;content in Favour of your particular Opinions; Opinions, which, if they are not ill founded, are at lea&s;t very problematical: I cannot help ob&s;erving, that your Re&s;entment again&s;t the Perfidy of the Enemy, has made you &s;eem much more intent upon affronting <HI>France,</HI> than providing deliberately for the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;et forth, with great Strength of Fact and Rea&s;on, the Treachery of <HI>France,</HI> and her frequent Violations of the mo&s;t &s;olemn Treaties. You in&s;i&s;t particularly on the Ca&s;e of <HI>Dunkirk:</HI> and I admit that you could not have cho&s;en a more proper In|&s;tance. But I am &s;orry to &s;ee that you are even here guided more by old Prejudices than by the true Na|ture of Things; and that you have propo&s;ed &s;uch a <HI>Manner</HI> of acting, that, whil&s;t we are in Reality only demanding our hone&s;t and unque&s;tionable Rights, we may have all the Appearance of acting with the mo&s;t wanton In&s;olence, with the mo&s;t hate|ful Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>You propo&s;e to the Two great Men, that,
<PB N="8" REF="008751_0006_102FDAA186211B68">
<Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid. P. 24, 25.</HI></NOTE> before they enter upon any new Treaty, or li&s;ten to any plau&s;ible Propo&s;al whatever, they ought to in&s;i&s;t that Ju&s;tice may be done with Regard to for|mer Treaties; &s;hew <HI>France</HI> the &s;olemn Engagements &s;he entered into at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> to demoli&s;h <HI>Dunkirk.</HI> Demand</Q>
&s;ay you,
<Q>immediate Ju&s;tice on that Article, as a preliminary Proof of her Sincerity in the en&s;uing Negotiation. Tell them, with the Firmne&s;s of wi&s;e Conquerors, that the Demolition of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is what you are intitled to by Treaties made long ago and violated, and that it &s;hall not be &s;o much as mentioned in the en&s;uing Negotiation, but complied with before that Negotiation &s;hall com|mence.</Q></P>
<P>Though this is a Sort of Language hitherto, I believe, unheard in <HI>Europe,</HI> why you confine it to <HI>Dunkirk</HI> I cannot imagine. Why would you not have them in the &s;ame <HI>previous</HI> Manner renounce all Right to the di&s;puted Parts of <HI>America?</HI> You will, I hope, allow, that the <HI>French</HI> Encroachments there, are as much again&s;t the Faith of Treaties, as the Re&s;toration of <HI>Dunkirk</HI>; and that we have full as good a Right to expect every Reparation of In|tere&s;t and Honour with Regard to the one as to the other. But if all Points wherein the Violation of Treaties is charged, ought not, according to your Doctrine, to be &s;o much as mentioned in the en&s;uing Negotiation, but ought to be &s;ettled before that Ne|gotiation &s;hall commence, the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Con|gre&s;s will be &s;o very &s;hort, and &s;o very ea&s;y, as to require no wonderful Share of that Knowledge, that Adroitne&s;s, and all that Combination of Talents, and Virtues, which you demand in a Plenipotentia|ry; but which you are almo&s;t in De&s;pair of finding among our Nobility. To &s;peak and to act to the Letter of the In&s;tructions which you give him, in|&s;tead
<PB N="9" REF="008751_0007_102FDAA3B7F3C2D0">
of all tho&s;e Qualifications, he need only a&s;&s;ume a deci&s;ive and dictatorial Tone; to rail abundantly at tho&s;e employed by the Enemy to treat with him; to remind <HI>them of their amazing Perfidy</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 24.</NOTE>; to tell them <HI>that he owes them a Di&s;grace</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 25.</NOTE>; to tell them <HI>that he can have no Dealings with &s;uch a People</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. ib.</NOTE>; and thus to go through the little that is left to be done with as great Airs of Arrogance and Superi|ority as he can po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;ume. The&s;e are Accom|pli&s;hments indeed not difficult to be found, and which we need not de&s;pair to meet with at <HI>Arthur's, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">r on the Turf.</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">P. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>I do not, Sir, mean to in&s;inuate, that the Demo|lition of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is not an Object worthy of our Re|gard. It is indeed probably not of quite &s;o much Importance, as you think it, and as formerly it was thought, whil&s;t in the Continental Wars of King <HI>William,</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> we neglected our Naval Strength, and the due Protection of our Trade. However, as it is &s;till an Object, there is no Doubt but in the en&s;uing Negotiation our Mini&s;try will at|tend with proper Care to have it demoli&s;hed, accor|ding to the Tenor of former Treaties. This, Sir, we may &s;ay with &s;ome A&s;&s;urance, will be done. But that this be done before we conde&s;cend to treat, that it is to be a Preliminary to the Preliminaries of Peace, is an Idea altogether extravagant, and as lit|tle ju&s;tified by Precedent as by Rea&s;on. That tho&s;e very Matters for which War was declared &s;hould not be &s;o much as mentioned in the Ne|gotiation for Peace, is a Principle entirely your own, and to which all the Writers on Politics have to this Day been entirely Strangers. You &s;eem in|deed aware of this, and therefore a&s;&s;ert, that &s;uch De|mands as you propo&s;e <NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. P. 9. of the Letter.</NOTE>
<Q>cannot be looked upon
<PB N="10" REF="008751_0008_102FDAA5ECA96D08">
as the In&s;olence of a Conqueror, but as the wi&s;e Fore&s;ight of a People, whom dear-bought Expe|rience hath taught the proper Way of doing it|&s;elf Justice.</Q>
For you ob&s;erve &s;ome few Lines before that we ought
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. P. 9. of the Letter.</NOTE> to take every Method in our Power to <HI>&s;ecure</HI> the Ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions they may make; and to in&s;i&s;t upon their giving us &s;uch <HI>Proofs of their Sincerity</HI> be|fore any Negotiation is entered upon, as may give us &s;ome <HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> that they <HI>mean to be more faithful</HI> to their <HI>future Engagements.</HI></Q>
The Way you propo&s;e, then, of doing our&s;elves Ju&s;tice, is to in&s;i&s;t upon the&s;e Demands, as the Compliance with them by the <HI>French</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Security for their adhereing to the Treaty.</P>
<P>I &s;hould, Sir, mo&s;t willingly concur with you in recommending any Method which might &s;ecure their Adherence to &s;uch Conce&s;&s;ions as they &s;hall make; which might draw from them any <HI>real Proof of their Sincerity,</HI> or which would give us <HI>&s;ome A&s;&s;u|rance that they mean to be more faithful to their future Engagements:</HI> But I have con&s;idered your Demand in every Light which I was capable of putting it, and, after all, I am utterly unable to di&s;cover, if <HI>France</HI> &s;hould &s;ubmit to the humiliating Step you propo&s;e, what additional Security this will, or can give us, that &s;he will keep the Peace that is to en|&s;ue, whenever &s;he &s;hall find it her Intere&s;t to break it. This Step may indeed be a mortifying Confe&s;|&s;ion of her pre&s;ent Weakne&s;s, but can be no Sort of Security for her future Faith.</P>
<P>So far from having any &s;uch Operation, there is all the Rea&s;on in the World to expect that it would produce quite the contrary Effect. A Nation which, through the Nece&s;&s;ity of its Affairs, &s;ubmits to Terms impo&s;ed, for no other Purpo&s;e than to in&s;ult
<PB N="11" REF="008751_0009_102FDAA7838E1090">
her, &s;eeks the fir&s;t Opportunity to wipe off the Stain. She will not look upon &s;uch Engagements as a Treaty, but as an Oppre&s;&s;ion; and &s;he will find a Sort of Excu&s;e for the Infidelity of her Conduct in the In&s;olence of ours. Nations, like Men, often re&s;ent an In&s;ult more than an Injury.</P>
<P>Unrea&s;onable as this Demand may be, you how|ever &s;eem fond of it; for you again a&s;k,
<Q>Can you have any Dealings with a Power, who, if he refu&s;es this, at the very Time that he is treating, affords you &s;uch a manife&s;t Proof that his Word is not to be relied upon, and that you cannot tru&s;t to the Execution of any Promi&s;es ever &s;o &s;olemn|ly made?</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. P. 25. of the Letter.</NOTE> Why not? You may, Sir, un|doubtedly, have Dealings with &s;uch a Power, not|with&s;tanding &s;uch a Refu&s;al; becau&s;e he only does what is extremely natural, and extremely rea&s;onable, in refu&s;ing to de&s;troy a Place which is of U&s;e to him in War, before his Enemy has conde&s;cended to treat for Peace. You do not &s;ure, imagine, that any Nation is &s;o ignorant and &s;otti&s;h as not to know, that the voluntary weakening its Hands before a Nego|tiation for Peace, is not the Way to &s;ecure it good Terms in that Negotiation; and that they may well refu&s;e to comply with this ignominious and un&s;afe Condition, without manife&s;ting any Intention of &s;werving from their Engagements. If it could be &s;uppo&s;ed for a Moment, that our Admini&s;tration would adopt your Sy&s;tem, might not <HI>France,</HI> in her Turn, a&s;k, and very rea&s;onably too, What Security we propo&s;e to give, if &s;he &s;hould &s;ubmit to this ex|traordinary previous Preliminary, that we &s;hall, even then, con&s;ent, on our Side, to an equitable Peace? Or that this fir&s;t unrea&s;onable Demand may not be followed by others &s;till more unrea&s;onable, whil&s;t we have any Thing to a&s;k, or &s;he any Thing left to
<PB N="12" REF="008751_0010_102FDAAA56430920">
give? to an&s;wer, <HI>Vae victis,</HI> would &s;ound &s;trangely. To an&s;wer otherwi&s;e, with Con&s;i&s;tency, is impo&s;&s;ible. And it mu&s;t be allowed, that &s;o extraordinary a De|mand, previous to a Treaty, would be a very bad Omen of our Moderation in the framing it. A Compliance with it would indeed mortify the E|nemy; but it would add nothing to our real Strength, whil&s;t it would alarm every Nation near us, and a&s;|&s;i&s;t <HI>France</HI> in exciting that Jealou&s;y of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> naval Power, which &s;he has for a long Time been labouring, with great Indu&s;try, and &s;ome Succe&s;s, to infu&s;e into all the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> and parti|cularly into the maritime States. You have very well ob&s;erved upon the Terror which was excited by the Power of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and upon the gene|ral Confederacy again&s;t him, which was the Con&s;e|quence of this Power: But you have forgot to add, that the in&s;olent U&s;e he made of his Greatne&s;s, a|larmed as much, and provoked much more, than that enormous Power it&s;elf. It was indeed the true Cau&s;e of his Fall. Other Nations al&s;o may be thought too powerful; and they will be thought &s;o, whenever they exerci&s;e their Power with Haughti|ne&s;s. Without having Recour&s;e to a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 38.
<Q>And perhaps it might, on Inquiry, be worthy of another <HI>Monte&s;quieu,</HI> to a&s;&s;ign the Cau&s;es of the Ri&s;e and Fall of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy.</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Monte&s;quieu,</HI> perhaps, Sir, it may be found, that the <HI>Roman,</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Grandeur, have owed their Declen&s;ion to the &s;ame Cau&s;e: They had attained a greater Power than they had Wi&s;dom &s;ufficient to direct: For the Sake of gratifying the Pa&s;&s;ion of the Day, they lo&s;t Sight of their la&s;ting Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t rational Aim of our Ambition ought to be, to po&s;&s;e&s;s a ju&s;t Weight and Con&s;ideration in <HI>Europe</HI>; and that the Power of the Nation &s;hould be rather re&s;pectable than terrible. To effect this, it mu&s;t not be employed invidiou&s;ly: It mu&s;t ope|rate

di&s;creetly and quietly; then it will be happily felt in its Effects, while it is little &s;een in violent Exertions. The Genius and Di&s;po&s;ition of Nations, as well as Men, is be&s;t di&s;cerned by the U&s;e they make of Power. And therefore, my great Objec|tion to this Part of your Plan, does not ari&s;e from the Nature of the Thing which you de&s;ire; my Ob|jection is to the Time and Manner in which you in|&s;i&s;t on having it done; which is, as I apprehend, to our&s;elves of no Kind of U&s;e, and therefore arro|gant and unrea&s;onable towards the Enemy.</P>
<P>After the Propo&s;al concerning <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> you lay before the two great Men the other Parts of your Plan. And here you recommend it to them to di&s;|play their Moderation, by giving up <HI>Guadaloupe, Se|negal,</HI> and <HI>Goree</HI>; and their Wi&s;dom, by keeping the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every Part of <HI>Canada.</HI> To keep <HI>Canada</HI> is the Point you have principally at Heart:

<Q>invariably to be adhered to; this is to be the <HI>&s;ine qua non</HI> of the Peace; and unle&s;s it is, we &s;hall have a <HI>treacherous and delu&s;ive Peace.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Before I examine the Ju&s;tne&s;s of tho&s;e Motives that make you &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly attached to this Ob|ject, and &s;o indifferent to every other, I &s;hall beg Leave to remark upon the Con&s;equence you deduce from the Po&s;&s;ibility that <HI>Canada</HI> will be given up, <Q>that we &s;hall have a treacherous and delu&s;ive Peace.</Q></P>
<P>The Views which every State ought to have at the making of Peace, may be reduced to two.</P>

<P>P. 33.
<Q>This Plan is perfectly agreeable to that Moderation expre&s;&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty in his Speech. Ibid. The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Canada</HI> is no View of Ambition.</Q></P></NOTE> <HI>Views of Ambition,</HI> no Nation can po&s;&s;ibly claim more.</P>
<P>This admitted, Sir, I a&s;k, upon the fir&s;t Head, Whether the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Canada,</HI> properly &s;o call|ed, was ever one of tho&s;e Objects for which we be|gan the War? Was it ever mentioned as &s;uch in any of our Memorials or Declarations, or in any national or public Act what&s;oever?</P>
<P>The true Cau&s;e of the War, our real and indi&s;|putable Right, is well known. Our Claims were large enough for Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and for Security too. And will you &s;ay, Sir, that if, in the Beginning of the&s;e Troubles, <HI>France,</HI> influenced by a Dread of the Exertion of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Power, had acknowledged the&s;e Claims, had given up <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> or <HI>Acadia,</HI> with its ancient and true Boundaries, had demoli&s;h|ed their Fort in the Province of <HI>New York,</HI> had re|moved them&s;elves from the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and renounced all Claim to that Territory, and that, on tho&s;e Con|ce&s;&s;ions, the Mini&s;try had then cea&s;ed from Ho&s;ti|lities, without acquiring, or even claiming <HI>Canada,</HI> will you &s;ay, that we &s;hould have had a treacherous and delu&s;ive Peace? You will hardly venture to a&s;&s;ert, that we &s;hould. And is a Peace made after <HI>France</HI> has felt the Force of <HI>Britain,</HI> and &s;ubmitted to that Force, to be more treacherous and delu&s;ive than if &s;he had made it from an Apprehen&s;ion only of the Con&s;equences? Is a Peace to be treacherous and de|lu&s;ive, if we do not get, on that Peace, what we ne|ver claimed as our Right before the War? Is a Peace treacherous and delu&s;ive, that puts us in Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Territory larger than &s;everal flouri&s;hing

Mornachies? Is a Peace delu&s;ive and treacherous, only becau&s;e &s;omething is left to the Enemy?</P>
<P>But you do not a&s;&s;ert, that we have any original Right to <HI>Canada</HI>; nor do you &s;ay, that the Con|ce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Boundaries which we have claimed, do not give us a va&s;t Territory, and an advantage|ous Barrier.

<P>The <HI>French</HI> Plenipotentiaries, Sir, mu&s;t be very extraordinary Advocates to be &s;ilenced, and <HI>Europe,</HI> as extraordinary a Judge to be convinced by &s;uch an Argument. <HI>France,</HI> Sir, might an&s;wer, That &s;he can give no &s;uch Security. No Nation, whil&s;t inde|pendent, can give it. And therefore, no &s;uch Se|curity &s;hould be de&s;ired. To de&s;ire the Enemy's whole Country, upon no other Principle, but that otherwi&s;e you cannot &s;ecure your own, is turning the Idea of mere Defence into the mo&s;t dangerous of all Principles. It is leaving no Medium between Safe|ty and Conque&s;t. It is never to &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf &s;afe, whil&s;t your Neighbour enjoys any Security. Indeed, &s;uch a Que&s;tion, after the Matters di&s;puted in the War have been adju&s;ted, is an Avowal of &s;uch an unrea&s;onable Ambition, that I tru&s;t you will never be &s;econded in it by any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, or <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter. For it is a Que&s;tion that extends in|finitely in its Con&s;equences; extends (for any Thing I can &s;ee to the contrary), to the utter De&s;truction
<PB N="16" REF="008751_0014_102FDAB336097348">
of Mankind. For whil&s;t ever we have <HI>France,</HI> or any other Nation on our Borders, either in <HI>Europe</HI> or in <HI>America,</HI> we mu&s;t, in the Nature of Things, have frequent Di&s;putes and Wars with them; and we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, at lea&s;t, as often as we are &s;ucce&s;sful, that the Enemy is in Fault; that is, we mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e the Enemy had provoked us to take Arms, by the Violation of &s;ome Treaty, or by the Inva&s;ion of &s;ome undoubted Right. The Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Peace is, to adju&s;t and to determine the&s;e Di&s;putes: But af|ter the Enemy has agreed to our original Demands, if we go on to demand Security for the Pre&s;ervation of Peace, what le&s;s do we demand, than that they &s;hould yield them&s;elves, bound Hand and Foot, up to our Mercy? Let our Borders be ever &s;o extend|ed, as long as we have any Nation near us, we mu&s;t have the &s;ame Di&s;putes, the &s;ame Wars, and we mu&s;t demand, upon your Principle, the &s;ame Secu|rity at the Conclu&s;ion of a Peace.</P>
<P>There was a Nation indeed, which I am &s;ure we re&s;emble more in Courage than in Ambition and In|ju&s;tice, which frequently u&s;ed to demand &s;uch a Cau|tion: And &s;uch a Caution they actually did require from the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> when they intended it as a Preliminary to the utter De&s;truction of that People, and to the mo&s;t notorious Breach of Faith upon their own Side. Their Pretence was exactly yours; that the Enemy was a Nation perfidious to a Proverb; a People whom no Treaty could bind. They u&s;ed the <HI>Punica,</HI> in the &s;ame Manner that you do the <HI>Gallica fides.</HI> I need not inform you, Sir, what fol|lowed: And indeed it was impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch Prin|ciples and Preten&s;ions could end in any Thing but the total De&s;truction of the vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ee why the Arguments you employ concerning a Security for a peaceable Behaviour in <HI>Canada,</HI> would not be equally cogent for calling for the &s;ame Security in <HI>Europe.</HI> They are our Neigh|bours,
<PB N="17" REF="008751_0015_102FDAB59B606088">
and dangerous ones, here as well as there. The <HI>Low Countries, Lorrain, Al&s;ace,</HI> &s;hew us that the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy has been, at lea&s;t, as intent upon extending its Dominion in <HI>Europe,</HI> as it can be in <HI>America.</HI> We know that they have tried all the Methods of War, of Treaty, and of Marriages, to inlarge their dangerous Empire. But &s;till, dreaded as they are in <HI>Europe,</HI> (and much more to be dread|ed than ever they were in <HI>America</HI>), if we could be &s;o happy to &s;ee, what I fear we never &s;hall &s;ee, a Confederacy to reclaim their U&s;urpations, what would we &s;ay to the In&s;olence of tho&s;e who, on your Principle, &s;hould demand all <HI>France</HI> as a Security, that they &s;hould not make the like U&s;urpations for the future?</P>
<P>But, Sir, our real Dependence for keeping <HI>France,</HI> or any other Nation, true to her Engagements, mu&s;t not be in demanding Securities, which no Nation, whil&s;t independent, can give, but on our own Strength, and our own Vigilance.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the Truth, we owe our Lo&s;&s;es in <HI>America</HI> as much to our own Supinene&s;s as to the <HI>French</HI> Per|fidy. Our Mini&s;ters have heretofore acted in Re|gard to <HI>America,</HI> as if they expected, from a Magic in the Contract, that it would perform it&s;elf. They took no Steps to enforce it. But from the Wi&s;|dom and Vigour of our pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration, I &s;hould expect another Conduct. As &s;oon as <HI>France</HI> is happily reduced to cede us &s;uch Boundaries as may be thought proper to demand, the &s;ame Spirit that has conducted the War, will maintain the Terms of the Peace. In&s;tead of leaving <HI>France</HI> at li|berty to build Forts at her Di&s;cretion, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forts will be rai&s;ed at &s;uch Pa&s;&s;es, as may at once make us re&s;pectable to the <HI>French,</HI> and to the <HI>Indian</HI> Na|tions. God forbid that we &s;hould depend on the Sincerity of our Enemy. Every wi&s;e Nation will rely on its own Watchfulne&s;s, and on its own
<PB N="18" REF="008751_0016_102FDAB72464E500">
Strength, to maintain the Terms they oblige their Enemy to give them; and whoever expects any o|ther Dependence, will find him&s;elf the Dupe.</P>
<P>To &s;upply any Defect that may be in your own Authority to per&s;uade this Mea&s;ure, your favourite Mea&s;ure of retaining <HI>Canada,</HI> you call in the Aid of our <HI>American</HI> Colonies; and tell us,
<Q>Though Care &s;hould be taken to keep all that we have claimed, &s;omething more mu&s;t be done, or our <HI>American</HI> Colo|nies will tell you, you have done nothing.</Q>
On what Authority this is &s;o po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted to be the Language of our <HI>American</HI> Colonies, you have not told us. I hope and believe that you have been mi&s;informed. But if our <HI>American</HI> Colonies &s;hould be &s;o ab&s;urd and ungreatful to tell us, after all the Blood and Trea&s;ure expended in their Cau&s;e, that we do nothing, if we do not make Conque&s;ts for them, they mu&s;t be taught a Le&s;&s;on of greater Moderation. If, with a Superiority of at lea&s;t ten to one, with a va&s;t and advantageous Barrier, with the proper Precautions to &s;trengthen it, under the Protection of a great Naval Power, they cannot think them&s;elves &s;ecure, they mu&s;t blame their own Cowardice or Ignorance, and not the Mea&s;ures of their Mother Country; who is bound to provide for their Happine&s;s and Security, and not for their vain Ambition, or groundle&s;s Fears.</P>
<P>The Idea of &s;ecuring your&s;elf, only by having no other Nation near you, is, I admit, an Idea of <HI>A|merican</HI> Extraction. It is the genuine Policy of Sa|vages; and it is owing to this Policy, that <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> are able at this Day to di&s;pute the Sove|reignty of De&s;erts in <HI>America</HI>; to which neither of us would otherwi&s;e have had any Right.</P>
<P>As we pretend no original Right to <HI>Canada,</HI> that we can very rationally &s;ecure our&s;elves in <HI>North A|merica</HI> without the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, will, I appre|hend, need very few Arguments to demon&s;trate.
<PB N="19" REF="008751_0017_102FDABA148B8198">
I have already ob&s;erved upon the va&s;t Superiority of Men that we have there; &s;uch a Superiority, that I am always a&s;toni&s;hed when I think on the unaccountable Conduct that has ever made <HI>France</HI> an Enemy to be apprehended on that Continent. We are in <HI>North America</HI> not only a greater Naval, but a far greater Continental Power. Our Supe|riority in Point of Situation is no le&s;s vi&s;ible. If, added to the&s;e Advantages, we acquire on a Peace all tho&s;e important Po&s;ts and Communications, by which alone <HI>Canada</HI> became in any Degree dange|rous to us, I cannot &s;ee why <HI>Canada,</HI> weakened, &s;tripped, confined, and I may &s;ay, bound down, will not be infinitely in more Danger, in Ca&s;e of any Rupture between the two Nations, from our Colo|nies, than ours can be from it.</P>
<P>I cannot help ob&s;erving, that among all your I|deas of Security, and that in particular anxious as you are for the Security of <HI>North America,</HI> you &s;hew little Regard to that of the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> Our <HI>Ca|ribbee</HI> I&s;lands mu&s;t be ever infinitely in greater Dan|ger from <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> than our <HI>North American</HI> Co|lonies can be from <HI>Canada</HI> circum&s;cribed as it ought, and as it is pre&s;umed it will be. The <HI>French</HI> have a real Superiority in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and they have once made it to be &s;everely felt.</P>
<P>If, as it has been &s;hewn, we may, beyond any rational Fear, &s;ecure our&s;elves without the intire Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Canada,</HI> we can de&s;ire it in Preference to our other Conque&s;ts only on Account of its &s;uperior Value. Though you have not at all in&s;i&s;ted on this, yet, le&s;t this may be thought one of your Mo|tives to that great Preference, and it is, &s;ure the be&s;t Motive you could have had, we will con&s;ider the Point &s;omewhat at large, and this will bring us to the &s;econd of tho&s;e leading Ideas, that ought to guide a Nation in a Treaty of Peace; that is, to acquire a proper Indemnification for the Expences of the

War. You are not one of the Number of tho&s;e who think we ought to give up nothing in a Peace. You do not claim <HI>Canada</HI> on a Principle of Right. We have examined it on the Principle of Security; the only Que&s;tion that now remains to be di&s;puted between us is, Whether <HI>Canada</HI> be a better Indemni|fication for the Expences of the War, than all our other Conque&s;ts put together? for you give up all the Re&s;t with great Ea&s;e, and in&s;i&s;t on this only.</P>
<P>Before we enter into a Compari&s;on between the Value of our Acqui&s;itions in the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> and tho&s;e in <HI>Canada,</HI> I mu&s;t beg leave to take &s;ome Notice of your Rea&s;on, your only Rea&s;on, for giving up the I&s;land of <HI>Guadaloupe</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 33.
<Q>The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> an additional Sugar I&s;land, when we have &s;o many of our own, ought not to be in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly as to make it a nece&s;&s;ary Condi|tion of the Peace; and though <HI>Senegal</HI> and <HI>Goree</HI> are of real Importance in the Slave and Gum Trades, our own <HI>African</HI> Settlements have hitherto &s;upplied us with Slaves &s;ufficient for our <HI>American</HI> Purpo&s;es.</Q></NOTE>,
<Q>that we have already &s;o many Sugar I&s;lands of our own.</Q>
If any Argu|ment could po&s;&s;ibly be drawn from our having A|bundance of Territory, &s;urely its holds much more &s;trongly with Regard to <HI>North America,</HI> where one of our Provinces alone has more Land than ours, and all the <HI>French</HI> Sugar Lands put together. If we have in the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> Land enough for Sugar, &s;urely we have Land enough in <HI>North America</HI> for the far le&s;s valuable Commodities, which are produ|ced on that va&s;t Continent. On what Grounds you are plea&s;ed to think the keeping a great Sugar I&s;land an Acqui&s;ition of little Con&s;equence, I am unable to comprehend. You know, &s;urely, that in one of our I&s;lands, the greate&s;t of them, we labour under a Sort of Monopoly, and under other Di&s;advantages, hard, if not impo&s;&s;ible to be remedied.

It was no &s;ooner found that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was intent on &s;ettling the I&s;land of <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> than &s;ome con&s;iderable Planters immediately removed thither, and it is now almo&s;t wholly &s;et|tled by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Many have actually Intere&s;ts in <HI>Martinico</HI>; and <HI>Guadaloupe</HI> was &s;carce taken, when our Planters flocked thither, and immediately made conditional <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay <HI>conditional,</HI> becau&s;e the Capitulation has rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to make an ab&s;olute Purcha&s;e; but they have alrea|dy made Contracts to purcha&s;e, if the I&s;land remains to us, and have taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Plantations by Virtue of &s;uch Con|tracts.</NOTE> Purcha&s;es, &s;en&s;ible of the Superiority of this I&s;land, and the Defects of our own.</P>

<P>To &s;hew you, Sir, how much the Sugar-trade might contribute to the Wealth and Power of any Nation, by what it formerly did contribute to ours, and what for a long Time pa&s;t it has contributed to
<PB N="22" REF="008751_0020_102FDAC0372B0430">
that of <HI>France,</HI> I will lay before you &s;ome Facts, which are, Sir, of a Nature infinitely more convin|cing than the warme&s;t Sallies of the mo&s;t lively Elo|quence. About the Time of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> we &s;upplied the greate&s;t Part of the Sugar-con&s;ump|tion throughout <HI>Europe. France,</HI> far from contend|ing with us in the foreign Market, took from us a great Part of what they u&s;ed at home. From the Year 1715 to 1719, we exported, one Year with another, 18,580 Hog&s;heads of Sugar; but from 1719 to 1722, we fell to le&s;s than half; for we &s;ent abroad but 9064 <HI>communibus annis.</HI> We continued regularly on the Decrea&s;e to 1739, in which Year our Sugar-export had fallen to 4078 Hog&s;heads. Since that Time, it has fallen almo&s;t to nothing. Now, let us turn the other Side, and view the Su|gar-trade of <HI>France</HI> &s;ince the &s;ame Period, the Trea|ty of <HI>Utrecht.</HI> At that Time the <HI>French</HI> exported no Sugars. But mark, Sir, the Revolution in 1740, when the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade in that Article was in a Man|ner annihilated: <HI>France,</HI> after &s;erving her Home-con&s;umption at a very ea&s;y Rate, exported no less than 80,000 Hog&s;heads of Sugar, which, with the Gains of the Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was reputed to be worth to <HI>France</HI> more than a Million <HI>Sterling,</HI> to employ 40 Ton of Shipping, and 4000 Seamen, &s;olely in bringing from the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> to <HI>Europe.</HI> The&s;e, Sir, are Facts to proclaim loudly the Advantage of tho&s;e I&s;lands to <HI>France</HI> whil&s;t they were in her Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; and declare no le&s;s &s;trongly the Advantages which mu&s;t accrue to <HI>Britain,</HI> if &s;he could attain the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the very be&s;t of them. Facts the&s;e that ought not to be pa&s;&s;ed lightly, until you can &s;hew &s;omething like them in Favour of the Plan you &s;o warmly embrace; which cannot, I believe, be done. I therefore, Sir, cannot help thinking, that your Rea&s;ons for rejecting <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> on the Principle <HI>of our having Sugar-land enough,</HI> are not

near &s;o &s;trong, or the Matter &s;o well weighed, as the Importance of the Que&s;tion de&s;erves.</P>
<P>But let us &s;ee what the Value of this <HI>Canada</HI> is, in Compari&s;on of which you reject all our other Ac|qui&s;itions.</P>
<P>Unluckily for your Argument, you your&s;elf in|form us <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 30 and 33.</NOTE> at your &s;etting out, that the <HI>French</HI> &s;et very little Value upon this Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and that they have even deliberated, whether it &s;hould not be en|tirely abandoned.</P>
<P>If, in the Hands of the <HI>French,</HI> who have no other Northern Colony, from whence to &s;upply their I&s;lands with Lumber, Corn, and Provi&s;ion, <HI>Cana|da</HI> was of &s;o very little Importance, what is it like to prove in ours, who have &s;uch immen&s;e Tracts &s;o much more conveniently &s;ituated for that Trade; and who can ea&s;ily &s;upply Five Times the Con&s;ump|tion of ours, theirs, and all the other <HI>We&s;t In|dia</HI> I&s;lands put together; and that too at a much ea|&s;ier Rate than they can po&s;&s;ibly have the&s;e Things at from <HI>Canada?</HI> But I do not in&s;i&s;t upon this Ar|gument, though it is &s;trong again&s;t you; becau&s;e I do not believe that <HI>France</HI> has &s;uch a Di&s;regard for this their only con&s;iderable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in <HI>North America.</HI> It is a great While &s;ince they thought of giving it up; and they are long convinced that it is of &s;ome U&s;e to them, independent of their Hopes of incroaching on our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. A&s;k tho&s;e, Sir, who lately &s;aw <HI>Canada,</HI> if it had the Face of a Colo|ny which the Mother-country was weary of hold|ing? I believe, Sir, they will tell you, that the Cultivation of the Lands, the Number and Neat|ne&s;s of the Hou&s;es, the warm Condition of the In|habitants, by no Means &s;eemed to imply, that they were neglected by <HI>France</HI>; but evinced rather, that this Colony was the Object of her very tender Concern.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="008751_0022_102FDAC4192BC190">There are, independent of the Opinion or De|&s;igns of <HI>France,</HI> many Rea&s;ons why we &s;hould not think <HI>Canada</HI> a valuable Exchange for our Con|que&s;t in the <HI>We&s;t Indies. Canada,</HI> &s;ituated in a cold Climate, produces no Commodity, except Furs and Skins, which &s;he can exchange for the Commodities of <HI>Europe</HI>; and con&s;equently &s;he can have little Re|turns to make the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant. We know what trifling Returns we have from &s;ome of our own very flouri&s;hing Colonies in <HI>America.</HI> The whole Trade of Furs and Skins, which <HI>Canada</HI> carried on with <HI>France,</HI> fell &s;hort, in its mo&s;t flouri&s;hing State, of 140,000 a-year. The Re&s;t of their Produce, with regard to the Market of <HI>Europe,</HI> is as nothing. A very great Part of the Value of tho&s;e Furs was re|turned from <HI>France</HI> in the Article of Brandy, with|out which, the Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> for their Beaver and Deer Skins could not be carried on. But, as an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantation, <HI>Canada</HI> mu&s;t &s;upply it&s;elf, as all the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations do, with Rum; el&s;e they will be obliged entirely to relinqui&s;h the Fur and Peltry Trade, which is the only valuable Trade they have. But let it be con|&s;idered, how they can come to the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Mar|ket from the Bottom of the River <HI>St. Laurence,</HI> with the gro&s;s and cheap Article of Lumber and Corn, on a Footing with our Colonies, many of which are not three Weeks Sail from the <HI>Leeward</HI> I&s;lands. They could neither Trade with <HI>Europe,</HI> nor with the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> with any tolerable Advantage; not with the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> becau&s;e they mu&s;t be under&s;old in that Market; not with <HI>Europe,</HI> becau&s;e, being &s;o under&s;old, they cannot have the Rum that is nece&s;|&s;ary for the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade, which keeps up their Commerce with <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, whil&s;t <HI>Canada</HI> is in the Hands of <HI>France,</HI> the Skin-trade may be kept up &s;o as to be an Ob|ject;
<PB N="25" REF="008751_0023_102FDAC799D05A48">
becau&s;e the Return for tho&s;e Commodities, brings back the Brandy with which they are pur|cha&s;ed: And thus the Trade is kept alive by a con|tinual Circulation. The bulkier Articles of Corn and Lumber may likewi&s;e continue a Branch of their Trade; becau&s;e it is their Intere&s;t to &s;upport, by eve|ry Method, the Vent of the&s;e Articles in their <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> in Preference to Foreigners. But <HI>Canada,</HI> in our Hands can have no &s;uch Preference; and there|fore, from its Situation, cannot be on an Equality in the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Market; and from which Market a|lone it is that they, as a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, can de|rive the Spirits, or tho&s;e Materials for Spirits, with|out which the Fur and Peltry, their only Trade, mu&s;t certainly peri&s;h. The&s;e Principles appear to me &s;o well grounded, that I think it no Pre&s;ump|tion to prophe&s;y,
<Q>if that Place &s;hould ever be ours, the Fur-trade of <HI>Canada</HI> mu&s;t inevitably come to little or nothing in a few Years.</Q></P>
<P>But let us extend our View a little farther; let us &s;uppo&s;e, that if, in&s;tead of aiming at the entire Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>North-America,</HI> we confine our&s;elves to tho&s;e Limits which we have always claimed there; and that <HI>Canada</HI> is re&s;tored to <HI>France,</HI> curtailed in &s;uch a Manner as to &s;ecure the <HI>Ohio</HI> Country, and the Communication of the Lakes. The Coun|try to the Southward of Lake <HI>Erie,</HI> and near the <HI>Ohio,</HI> is the greate&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> hunting Country in <HI>North America.</HI> If this Territory &s;hould remain with us on a Peace, it naturally draws to us all that Trade which depends upon the hunting of Deer and Beaver; and if this Country &s;hould be further &s;ecured to us, by the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Niagara,</HI> which is a Po&s;t of in|finite Importance, and entirely commands the great Lakes of <HI>Erie</HI> and <HI>Ontario,</HI> I cannot &s;ee how it is po&s;&s;ible to keep the far greater Part of the Com|merce of <HI>North America</HI> out of our Hands. The <HI>Indians</HI> mu&s;t every where be intercepted before they
<PB N="26" REF="008751_0024_102FDAC9D67D81E0">
can arrive at the <HI>French</HI> Colony, even &s;uppo&s;ing (what can never be) that the <HI>French</HI> could entice them thither by &s;elling cheaper than our Dealers.</P>
<P>Thus, without aiming at the total Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Canada,</HI> by e&s;tabli&s;hing proper Limits, and by &s;ecur|ing them properly, we may draw to our&s;elves a great Part of that Trade which mu&s;t give <HI>Canada</HI> it|&s;elf any Value, in the Eyes of a commercial Nation.</P>
<P>So that the Que&s;tion, Sir, is not, Whether <HI>Ca|nada</HI> extended to the Ocean, by a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the River <HI>St. John,</HI> and a great Part of <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> in|croaching upon, and menacing <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New England,</HI> commanding exclu&s;ively all the Lakes and Rivers, whether &s;uch a Country ought to be kept in Preference to <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> and our other Conque&s;t? but, Whether <HI>Canada,</HI> &s;tripped of the&s;e Advantages, and confined to its proper Bounds, confined to the <HI>Northward</HI> of tho&s;e Lakes and Rivers, be a better Acqui&s;ition than our rich Conque&s;t in the <HI>We&s;t Indies?</HI></P>
<P>If we compare the Value of the Returns of <HI>Canada,</HI> even whil&s;t it flouri&s;hed mo&s;t by its Incroachments upon us, with tho&s;e of <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> we &s;hall find them in no Degree of Competition. The Fur|trade, who&s;e Value is before mentioned, is its whole Trade to <HI>Europe.</HI> But <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> be&s;ides the great Quantities of Sugars, Cotton, Indigo, Coffee, and Ginger, which it &s;ends to Market, carries on a Trade with the <HI>Carraccas</HI> and other Parts of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Main, which is a Trade wholly in the Manufactures of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Returns for which, are almo&s;t wholly in ready Money. Without e&s;timating the Land, the Hou&s;es, the Works, and the Goods in the I&s;land, the Slaves, at the lowe&s;t Valuation, are worth upwards of one Million two hundred and fif|ty thou&s;and Pounds <HI>Sterling.</HI> It is a known Fact, that they make more Sugar in <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> than in any of our I&s;lands, except <HI>Jamaica.</HI> This Branch a|lone,
<PB N="27" REF="008751_0025_102FDACB60493688">
be&s;ides the Employment of &s;o much Shipping, and &s;o many Seamen, will produce clear 300,000 <HI>per Annum</HI> to our Merchants. For, having &s;ufficient from our own I&s;lands, to &s;upply our Home-con|&s;umption, the whole Sugar-produce of <HI>Guadaloupe</HI> will be exported; and will con&s;equently be &s;o much clear Money to <HI>Great Britain.</HI> And, Sir, the whole Produce of <HI>Canada,</HI> though it were all exported from <HI>England,</HI> and exported compleatly <HI>manufactured,</HI> would not amount to the Value of that &s;ingle Article <HI>unmanufactured</HI>; nor would it employ the one twen|tieth Part of the Shipping, and the Seamen. But this, though the large&s;t, is not the only Produce of <HI>Guadaloupe</HI>; Coffee, which in our I&s;lands is none, or a very incon&s;iderable Object, is there a very great one. They rai&s;e be&s;ides, great Quantities of Indigo and Cotton, which &s;upply Materials for our be&s;t and mo&s;t valuable Manufactures, and which employ ma|ny more Hands than the Increa&s;e of the Hat-trade, propo&s;ed by the keeping <HI>Canada,</HI> can do. This i&s;land is capable, in our Hands, of being improved to dou|ble its pre&s;ent Value; whereas <HI>Canada,</HI> in our Hands, would not probably yield half what it did to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>There is, Sir, one Argument I would u&s;e parti|cularly to you, who are &s;o &s;trongly &s;en&s;ible of the Inconvenience <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is to us from its Situation. Surely there is not a &s;ingle Word you &s;ay, in Re&s;pect to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> that does not hold as &s;trongly in Regard to <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> &s;ituated in the very Heart of our <HI>Leeward</HI> I&s;lands, and there infe&s;ting one of the mo&s;t advantageous Branches of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce. It is not to be denied but that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;ter and the <HI>London</HI> Trader has &s;uffered by the <HI>Dunkirk</HI> Privateers; but their Lo&s;&s;es this War have not been near &s;o con&s;iderable as that of the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and above all of the <HI>North American</HI> Traders, who&s;e In|tere&s;t, I believe, you will not di&s;pute to be of &s;ome Importance. A&s;k, Sir, the <HI>North American</HI> Tra|ders,
<PB N="28" REF="008751_0026_102FDACE9101F548">
a&s;k the People of the <HI>Leeward</HI> I&s;lands, what a va&s;t Security they thought it to their Trade, that <HI>Guadaloupe</HI> &s;hould be in our Hands? Our I&s;lands were &s;o annoyed from thence, that they &s;carce con|&s;idered it in any other Light than as a Ne&s;t of Pri|vateers: They were &s;urpri&s;ed on going there, to find a People richer than in any of our own I&s;lands; and Land &s;o much better than their own, that many of our rich Planters have already made <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay <HI>conditional,</HI> becau&s;e the Capitulation rendered it im|po&s;&s;ible for them to make ab&s;olute Purcha&s;es; but they have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of Plantations, by Contract, to purcha&s;e them if the I&s;land remains to <HI>Great Britain.</HI></NOTE> conditional Purcha&s;es there.</P>
<P>Not to confine our Views &s;olely to a commercial Point, give me Leave to mention one great Advan|tage that, in a political Light, may ari&s;e from our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Guadaloupe.</HI> It is very well known, that the Hand of Government is heavy on the Prote&s;tants of <HI>France</HI>; many of the&s;e People are already e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in this I&s;land, and they have Connections of every Kind with tho&s;e of their own Per&s;ua&s;ion at home; and may we not hope and expect that this may be an Inducement to many others to make this their Retreat, and that the Colony may be enriched by them?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Sir, in whatever Light you view the I&s;land of <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> you will find it a mo&s;t valuable and a mo&s;t de&s;irable Object. Do you a&s;k to de|prive your Enemy of an advantageous Po&s;t, from whence he might materially mole&s;t your Trade in Time of War? Do you wi&s;h to extend your Trade in Time of Peace, and to have a new Market for all your Manufactures? From being &s;carce able to &s;upply the Home-Con&s;umption with Sugar, do you de&s;ire to be foremo&s;t at the foreign Market? This I&s;land, Sir, of <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> that you e&s;teem &s;o little, will an&s;wer all the&s;e Ends; Ends &s;o material, that I

tru&s;t, Sir, that the Stone you have rejected, will be made the Corner Stone in the Temple of Peace.</P>
<P>Therefore, Sir, I mu&s;t repeat it, that I am not a little &s;urpri&s;ed that you &s;hould pa&s;s over, in a Manner &s;o carele&s;s, and with &s;uch extreme Superficiality, a Point &s;o very material and intere&s;ting as this, to tell us, that <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 33.</NOTE>
<Q><HI>the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of</HI> Guadaloupe, an ad|ditional Sugar I&s;land, when we have &s;o many of our own, ought not to be &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon, as to make it a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of the Peace.</Q>
Had you taken the Pains to inform your&s;elf of the Facts nece&s;&s;ary for making a Judgment on this Matter, or had you duly attended to them, you could not po&s;|&s;ibly have &s;aid, that it was not to be in&s;i&s;ted upon, and in the &s;ame Breath a&s;&s;ert, that, without <HI>Canada,</HI> we &s;hould have a treacherous and delu&s;ive Peace.</P>

<P>You look upon the&s;e I&s;lands only as an inferior dependent Part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plantations, which you &s;carce think worth While to mention: But, be|cau&s;e I think you are under &s;ome Mi&s;take in this Point, in addition to tho&s;e Rea&s;ons which have been given to &s;hew the Preference of <HI>Guadaloupe</HI> in parti|cular to <HI>Canada,</HI> there are &s;ome Facts which I beg Leave to &s;ubmit to your Ob&s;ervation, concerning
<PB N="30" REF="008751_0028_102FDAD249C167F0">
<HI>Settlements</HI> on the Continent of <HI>North America</HI> and Plantations in the <HI>We&s;t Indian</HI> I&s;lands. Though it may be a new Idea, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to &s;ay, that an <HI>I&s;land Colony</HI> is always more advantageous than a continental one, for the Mother-country.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the <HI>We&s;t-Indian</HI> I&s;lands never con&s;ider them&s;elves as at home there: They &s;end their Children to the Mother-country for Education; they them&s;elves make many Trips to the Mother-country to recover their Health, or enjoy their For|tunes. If they have Ambition, it is hither they come to gratify it. I need not, I &s;uppo&s;e, ob&s;erve to you, how many Gentlemen of the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> have Seats in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hou&s;e of Commons. I might, I be|lieve, venture to &s;ay, there are very few who have inherited Plantations in any of our I&s;lands, who have not had an <HI>European</HI> Education, or at lea&s;t have not &s;pent &s;ome Time in this Kingdom. Many who have Plantations, receive and &s;pend the whole Pro|fits of them here, without ever having even &s;een the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> If the Commerce with the <HI>We&s;t-Indian</HI> I&s;lands had even been, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, again&s;t us, this Circum&s;tance alone would turn the Balance in our Favour. But this, in Truth, is very far from being the Ca&s;e. The Trade we carry on with that Part of the World is as happily circum&s;tanced as Imagination could form it. The <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands lie in a Climate different totally from ours. The natural Produce, therefore, interferes, in no Re|&s;pect with that of <HI>England.</HI> Their Produce is on|ly &s;uch as the Ta&s;te and Turn of our Manners call for; but demand &s;o &s;trongly, that if we had them not from our own Colonies, we mu&s;t purcha&s;e from Strangers. The Commerce between the Mother-country and a <HI>We&s;t-Indian</HI> I&s;land is natural and ea&s;y. It needs, in no Re&s;pect, to be forced or managed: They are mutually formed for each other: Neither is there any Sort of Fear, that the I&s;lands in that Part
<PB N="31" REF="008751_0029_102FDAD4788FA128">
of the World &s;hall ever make this Commerce le&s;s ea&s;y or le&s;s advantageous. The extreme Dearne&s;s of Provi&s;ion will never &s;uffer them, how much &s;oever they may be inclined, to &s;et up any &s;ort of Manu|facture which may interfere with our Fabrics. So that the&s;e Colonies, by their very Nature, Situation, and Products, by what they have, and by what they want, are kept nece&s;&s;arily connected with and de|pendent upon <HI>England,</HI> and mu&s;t ever be &s;o, as long as we are able to protect them. Let us now exa|mine, Sir, whether the greate&s;t Part of the Plan|tations which we po&s;&s;e&s;s or de&s;ire in <HI>North America,</HI> can come in Competition with the I&s;lands, either in the Advantages we derive from them, or in the Certainty of holding tho&s;e Advantages for the Future. With regard to the E&s;tates in <HI>North America</HI> &s;pent in <HI>England,</HI> I may affirm, that from <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> to <HI>Ma|ryland</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> there are ab&s;olutely none; yet in this Tract are the four Provinces of <HI>New England,</HI> the great Countries of <HI>New York, Pen&s;ylvania,</HI> and the two <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> Places highly flouri&s;hing in Commerce, and abounding with People: Even to the South|ward of this Line, there are few E&s;tates either in Number or Value &s;pent in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>North America,</HI> the Climate is not in general unfavourable to an <HI>European</HI> Con&s;titution, and it is &s;uch in which Men fond of rural Diver&s;ions may pa&s;s their Time agreeably. The Truth is, tho' their E&s;tates &s;upply them with Plenty to live at home, they do not furni&s;h Mony enough to &s;end them a|broad. Excepting Proprietaries, I do not remember that this va&s;t Continent &s;upplies our Hou&s;e of Com|mons with one &s;ingle Member.</P>
<P>To view the Continent of <HI>America</HI> in a com|mercial Light, the Produce of all the Northern Co|lonies is the &s;ame as that of <HI>England,</HI> Corn, and Cattle; and therefore, except for a few naval Stores, there is very little Trade from thence directly to
<PB N="32" REF="008751_0030_102FDAD6E0CEB268">
<HI>England.</HI> Their own Commodities bear a very low Price; Goods carried from <HI>Europe</HI> bear a very high Price; and thus they are of nece&s;&s;ity driven to &s;et up Manufactures &s;imilar to tho&s;e of <HI>England,</HI> in which they are favoured by the Plenty and Cheapne&s;s of Provi&s;ions. In fact, there are Manufactures of ma|ny Kinds in the&s;e Northern Colonies, that promi&s;e in a &s;hort Time to &s;upply their Home-con&s;umption. From <HI>New England</HI> they begin even to export &s;ome things manufactured, as Hats, for in&s;tance. In the&s;e Provinces they have Colleges and Academies for the Education of their Youth; and as they increa&s;e daily in People and in Indu&s;try, the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Con|nection with <HI>England,</HI> with which they have no na|tural Intercour&s;e by a Reciprocation of Wants, will continually dimini&s;h. But as they recede from the Sea, all the&s;e Cau&s;es will operate more &s;trongly; they will have nothing to expect, they mu&s;t live wholly on their own Labour, and in Proce&s;s of Time will know little, inquire little, and care little about the Mother-country.</P>
<P>If, Sir, the people of our Colonies find no Check from <HI>Canada,</HI> they will extend them&s;elves, almo&s;t without Bounds, into the Inland Parts. They are invited to it by the Plea&s;antne&s;s, the Fertility, and the Plenty of that Country; and they will increa&s;e infinitely from all Cau&s;es. What the Con&s;equence will be, to have a numerous, hardy, independent People, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;trong Country, communica|ting little, or not at all with <HI>England,</HI> I leave to your own Reflections. I hope we have not gone to the&s;e immen&s;e Expences, without any Idea of &s;ecu|ring the Fruits of them to Po&s;terity. If we have, I am &s;ure we have acted with little Frugality or Fore|&s;ight. This is indeed a Point that mu&s;t be the con|&s;tant Object of the Mini&s;ters Attention, but is not a fit Subject for a Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; I will therefore expatiate no farther on this Topic: I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that
<PB N="33" REF="008751_0031_102FDAD9BAA6A9E8">
by eagerly gra&s;ping at exten&s;ive Territory, we may run the Ri&s;que, and that perhaps in no very di&s;tant Period, of lo&s;ing what we now po&s;&s;e&s;s. The Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Canada,</HI> far from being nece&s;&s;ary to our Safety, may in its Con&s;equence be even danger|ous. A Neighbour that keeps us in &s;ome Awe, is not always the wor&s;t of Neighbours. So that far from &s;acrificing <HI>Guadaloupe</HI> to <HI>Canada,</HI> perhaps, if we might have <HI>Canada</HI> without any Sacrifice at all, we ought not to de&s;ire it. And, be&s;ides the Points to be con|&s;idered between us and <HI>France,</HI> there are other Powers who will probably think them&s;elves intere&s;ted in the Deci&s;ion of this Affair. There is a Balance of Power in <HI>America</HI> as well as in <HI>Europe,</HI> which will not be forgotten; and <HI>this is a Point I &s;hould have expected would &s;omewhat have engaged your Attention.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to <HI>Senegal</HI> and <HI>Goree,</HI> I concur with you in not making them the principal Object of our Negotiations at the Congre&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 33. <Q><HI>Senegal</HI> and <HI>Goree,</HI> though of real Importance in the Slave and Gum Trades, our own <HI>African</HI> Settlements have hitherto &s;upplied us with Slaves &s;ufficient for our <HI>Ame|rican</HI> Purpo&s;es; and the Gum Trade is not perhaps of Con|&s;equence enough to make us Amends for the annual Mortality which we already lament of our brave Countrymen, to guard our <HI>African</HI> Conque&s;ts.</Q></NOTE> for a Peace; but it is upon Principles very different from yours. You de|&s;pi&s;e the <HI>African</HI> Trade, and that con&s;i&s;tently enough, becau&s;e you &s;eem to lay little Weight on that of the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> which is &s;upported by it; but the Reduction of the Price of Slaves, the whole Trade of Gum thrown into our Hands, and the Increa&s;e of tho&s;e of Gold and Ivory, would make even tho&s;e Places a far better Purcha&s;e than <HI>Canada,</HI> as might, I think, be &s;hewn without much Difficulty. But I do not in&s;i&s;t upon it; becau&s;e I think we ought to be as moderate in the Terms of Peace, as is con|&s;i&s;tent with a rea&s;onable Indemnification, and be|cau&s;e too I know, in the Nature of Things, that it
<PB N="34" REF="008751_0032_102FDADBF921E678">
is impo&s;&s;ible to retain all. In one word, I will not venture, Sir, to &s;ay, <HI>we have a treacherous and delu&s;ive Peace,</HI> unle&s;s the Peace is made in Confor|mity to my Ideas; for there may be Rea&s;ons that neither you, or I, Sir, can po&s;&s;ibly be acquainted with, which may make this not proper to be in&s;i&s;t|ed upon; but I will take upon me, Sir, to &s;ay, that if by this War we gain <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> we gain as great an Acqui&s;ition as ever this Nation gained by any Treaty or any War; and if it is po&s;&s;ible to retain this, we need not a&s;k for more.</P>
<P>At a Congre&s;s, Sir, in the Face of that Augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly, formed by the Repre&s;entatives of the Chri&s;tian World, we &s;hall there exhibit our&s;elves in our real Character, and &s;hew all the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> what they are to expect from us, and how far they ought to wi&s;h the Continuance and Increa&s;e of our Greatne&s;s. Therefore any &s;hew of arrogant Superiority, any unmea&s;urable Claim, any avari|cious Gra&s;ping, though they may &s;eem immediately to fall upon <HI>France,</HI> are in effect Menaces to every other Power. But if Moderation is nece&s;&s;ary there, when the War is ended, and when we act as a Na|tion, how much more nece&s;&s;ary is it to private Men, whil&s;t the War &s;till continues with that Uncertain|ty, which mu&s;t always attend the mo&s;t pro&s;perous Fortune. You cannot forget, in this very Year, what an A&s;pect our Affairs in <HI>Germany</HI> wore, before the glorious Battle of <HI>Minden</HI>; and you cannot be ignorant how much this mu&s;t have affected in a Negotiation for Peace. Things are not yet decided there; they look indeed favourable, but not favour|able enough, either with Regard to his Maje&s;ty's Army, and &s;till le&s;s with Regard to the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> to entitle you to pre&s;cribe Terms in the Stile of a <HI>Roman</HI> Dictator, even if any Fortune could intitle you to do it. Let us, Sir, u&s;e a little Moderation in our happy Hour, that we may at

all Events pre&s;erve an Uniformity of Conduct, and not act meanly, if, contrary to our Wi&s;hes, any rever&s;e of Fortune &s;hould oblige us to be moderate. I &s;hould indeed think it the more nece&s;&s;ary in you to have been &s;o, as you have not, in my humble Opinion, cho&s;en your Objects very properly. <HI>France,</HI> Sir, though beaten in all Quarters of the World, wor&s;ted both by Sea and Land; though the Credit of her Arms and her Finances are impaired, &s;he is not yet totally ruined; nor, as I conceive, brought &s;o low as &s;he was in the War of Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> Yet, Sir, you will be plea&s;ed to remember, that by the haughty Demeanor, the unrea&s;onable Expectations, the arrogant, I may &s;ay, ridiculous Demands of the Allies, the happy Hour for making Peace on the mo&s;t advantageous Conce&s;&s;ions was &s;uffered to e&s;cape; until Faction had Time to rai&s;e its Head in <HI>England,</HI> the Po&s;ture of Affairs to change Abroad, and the Fortune of the War to vary in &s;o many Particulars, that the Re&s;ult of all our Succe&s;s and Arrogance was&mdash;the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht.</HI> The M. <HI>de Torcy</HI>'s Memoirs are a lively Picture of this Con|duct and its Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>I have, Sir, attentively, and I hope it will be allowed fairly, examined your principal Arguments. You will give me Leave now to ob&s;erve a little upon &s;ome Things of le&s;s Con&s;equence, which lie de|tached from one another here and there in your Performance.</P>
<P>I re&s;pect the Zeal which you &s;hew for the Intere&s;t of your Country; but I think that Zeal has tran&s;|ported you much too far in your Reflections on the Conduct and Capacities of our Nobility. If the Ea&s;ine&s;s of their Fortunes hurries many of them in|to a Life of Di&s;&s;ipation and Plea&s;ure, that has al|ways been the Ca&s;e, becau&s;e it is the natural Con&s;e|quence of Youth and Affluence. This, if we may
<PB N="36" REF="008751_0034_102FDADFBAB5C130">
tru&s;t our Writers, was the Grievance of other Ages and other Countries as well as ours.</P>
<P>This War is principally, with Regard to us at lea&s;t, it is an <HI>American</HI> War. When I con&s;ider this, I own my Eyes are involuntarily led, as I be|lieve tho&s;e of mo&s;t Per&s;ons are, to the few who from their Inclinations, their Studies, their Opportunities, and their Talents, are made Perfectly Ma&s;ters of the State and Intere&s;ts of our Colonies. There cannot be many; therefore we cannot ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken. Nor can we, when we ca&s;t our Eye on the noble Per&s;on to whom we owe the judicious Settlement of that Frontier Colony, who&s;e Capital gratefully bears the Title of its Founder, by any Means de|&s;pair of an able Plenipotentiary at a Congre&s;s, where, for the fir&s;t Time, our own national Intere&s;t will be the principal Object of Negotiation.</P>
<P>I admire, Sir, with you, the noble Struggle which that great Prince, our Ally in this War, has made a|gain&s;t &s;uch a Combination of great Powers as meant to de&s;troy him. I could wi&s;h for his Virtues, and profe&s;s I almo&s;t expect from his Abilities, that he will &s;till extricate him&s;elf from all the Toils that &s;ur|round him.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, however, be remembered, that it is not to his Connection with us, that he owes his Di|&s;tre&s;s. He has not, like the unhappy Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> lo&s;t his Country twice, by adhering firmly to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in a Quarrel entirely <HI>Briti&s;h.</HI> We found him be&s;et with Enemies, our Intere&s;ts coinci|ded, we made an Alliance, and I am &s;ure he has already found in <HI>Great Britain</HI> a mo&s;t u&s;eful Ally; and I believe he always will find in her an Ally faithful to her Engagements.

to the immediate Expences of our own Country, and never to a&s;&s;i&s;t a New Ally without remembering how much we did for our Old one, and what Return we have had.</HI> We &s;ee plainly, Sir, by the Conduct of <HI>Great Britain</HI> at this Hour, that the Mini&s;try is not in|clined to let this Prince fall for Want of a due A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; but, &s;ure, while we a&s;&s;i&s;t him &s;o materially in <HI>Europe,</HI> we are not bound to &s;acrifice our Intere&s;ts in other Parts of the World. It may be a popular Doctrine; but I hope, it is not a Doctrine that will be received.</P>
<P><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 40, 41.
<Q>I would inculcate <HI>a Doctrine</HI> which, I think, will not be <HI>unpopular,</HI> and which therefore, I hope, will not be oppo&s;ed by our Mini&s;ters, that <HI>whatever Conque&s;t</HI> we have made, and whatever Conque&s;t we may &s;till make upon the <HI>French,</HI> except <HI>North America, which mu&s;t be kept all our own,</HI> &s;hould be looked upon as given back to <HI>France</HI> for a valuable Con&s;ideration, <HI>if it can be the Means of extricating the King of Pru&s;&s;ia from</HI> any unfore&s;een Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</Q></NOTE> Enthu&s;ia&s;m, Sir, is a noble Principle of Ac|tion; but good Sen&s;e and Knowledge only mu&s;t di|rect the &s;ole Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Negotiation. The Pro|te&s;tant Cau&s;e maintained it&s;elf before the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> was con&s;idered as its Protector; and I tru&s;t it will &s;till be able to &s;upport it&s;elf independent of him; it will indeed always find a &s;urer Support in the jarring Intere&s;t of the &s;everal Powers of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> which will certainly never cea&s;e, than in the Faith of any Prince, which will be always &s;ubject to Change.</P>
<P>The Circum&s;tances of that famous <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 41. P. 35. Vide Note.
<Q>The true Hi&s;tory of this Tran&s;action here alluded to, may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome Time or other appear; though, as yet, we are per&s;uaded that the World knows very little of it.</Q></NOTE> Oppo&s;ition in our Parliament, to which you allude, are indeed but little known. It is however, a Period about which no Man is uninqui&s;itive. Your De&s;cription
<PB N="38" REF="008751_0036_102FDAE5139E8988">
of the Medley which compo&s;ed that Oppo&s;ition, is &s;pirited, lively, and I doubt not, ju&s;t: If you were your&s;elf engaged in that Struggle, <HI>when you had dri|ven the common Enemy to the Wall,</HI> whether you found it convenient at that Time to quit your Friends, or Whether you thought your&s;elf de&s;erted by them, Time enough is now elap&s;ed to have for|gotten political Friend&s;hips, and perhaps too, to have worn out Party-re&s;entments; and in an Age &s;o fond of Anecdotes, and &s;o curious in Characters, a&s;&s;uredly nothing will be more acceptable than a true Hi&s;tory of that whole Tran&s;action.</P>
<P>It was indeed no unde&s;irable Time to have lived, when a Field was opened for every Man to di&s;play his Abilities, and exert his Talents; if we give the Reins to our Ambition, we &s;hould, Sir, regret that where <HI>&s;o many &s;killful Champions u&s;ed formerly to en|gage and &s;truggle for Victory, one Man &s;hould at this Day remain &s;ingle in the Field of Battle.</HI> But, alas! Sir, however mortifying this may be to us as Men, &s;urely as Citizens we mu&s;t rejoice that the great Man, to who&s;e active Spirit we in a great Mea&s;ure owe all our Glory, our Succe&s;s, I had almo&s;t &s;aid our very Safety, can employ his whole Time again&s;t the Ene|mies of his Country, without giving a Moment's Care to provide for his own Safety. If we con&s;ider it in this Light, Sir, &s;ure it mu&s;t be a mo&s;t plea&s;ing Contemplation to think, that <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 2.</NOTE>
<Q>the Extinction of factious Oppo&s;ition, the Unanimity of every Par|ty, and the Acquie&s;cence of every Connection, in whatever Scheme is propo&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty's Servants,</Q>
&s;uffer <HI>the Speaker without the lea&s;t De|bate or Oppo&s;ition to take the Chair, only to vote Mil|lions, and levy Thou&s;ands</HI>; <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. the Letter.</NOTE> but the&s;e Millions are voted, and the&s;e Thou&s;ands are levied, for the De|&s;truction of the Enemies of our Country.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="008751_0037_102FDAE69DECA118">Have a little Patience however; we &s;hall &s;oon, I tru&s;t, Sir, have beat all our Enemies, and then we &s;hall perhaps again have Lei&s;ure to quarrel among our&s;elves; we may then &s;ee more than one Champi|on in the Field; we may then li&s;t under that Banner, which our Intere&s;t or our Pa&s;&s;ions may direct us to.</P>
<P>In the mean time, let us thank Providence for the pre&s;ent happy Situation of our Affairs. Every Man &s;hould, as far as he can, endeavour to continue that Acquie&s;cence, to cheri&s;h that Concord and Union, which is indeed &s;o advantageous to our Country; and every Head of a Party mu&s;t in this have a &s;hare in our Acknowledgments for their Acquie&s;cence.</P>
<P>But the two great Per&s;ons you addre&s;s, at pre&s;ent engro&s;s the public Attention. The noble Lord has great Merit both to his Country and his Prince; his early Zeal cannot be forgotten. His exten&s;ive In|fluence, his per&s;onal Authority, exerted as they have been, and as I tru&s;t they always will be, for the good of his Country, will always challenge the good Opi|nion of his Countrymen. Nor will our Country for|get to do Ju&s;tice to the active Spirit of that great Man, to who&s;e unwearied Efforts <HI>Great Britain</HI> is &s;o much indebted for her pre&s;ent Glory; to whom you and I, Sir, owe it, that in a War with &s;uch a Power as <HI>France,</HI> we now debate whether our Country &s;hould u&s;e Moderation. I mean not, Sir, to make any Compari&s;on, for it is not now a Time to draw the nice Line between the Merits of great Men, or to a&s;certain exactly where the Merit of the one ends, and the other begins. Compari&s;ons are always invi|dious and might at this time be hurtful, and tend to weaken the Bonds that unite &s;o many in the Service of their Country.</P>
<P>It was no Spirit of Contradiction, Sir, that made me take the pains of an&s;wering your Letter; there|fore as I canva&s;s with Freedom tho&s;e Points which appear to me to be mi&s;taken, &s;o with great Plea&s;ure
<PB N="40" REF="008751_0038_102FDAE91DFD7D80">
I join Hands where I think what you &s;ay is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. I agree with you intirely in your Judg|ment of a place Bill, which would, I believe, be more effectual, if not made too violent in its fir&s;t O|peration like an <HI>Oliverian</HI> &s;elf-denying Ordinance. Your Judgment on Mediators is &s;urely ju&s;t and &s;en|&s;ible; and we may believe the Mini&s;try think &s;o, who have not employed any Mediation, though they have offered Terms to their Enemy.</P>
<P>I might now a&s;k yours and the public Indulgence for any Mi&s;takes. I have not willingly perverted or mi&s;repre&s;ented any thing. I do not pretend to the Credit of a Writer, but I have endeavoured to under|&s;tand the Que&s;tion I write upon, as I think every Man is bound to do who troubles the Public with his O|pinions. If I am mi&s;taken in what I advance, it does not much &s;ignify who the Author of wrong Notions may be. If my Opinions are well ground|ed, and my Remarks ju&s;t, my Country may receive &s;ome Benefit from them; and if &s;he receives a Be|nefit, it is of little Concern what Hand admini&s;ters it.</P>
