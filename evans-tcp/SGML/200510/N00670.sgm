In like manner the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, in &s;hewing Kindne&s;s to the Aboriginal Natives of <HI>America,</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly, &s;hew Kindne&s;s to <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> unawares.

And in very deed, the Families, and Churches which fir&s;t ventured to follow Chri&s;t thorow the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, into a &s;trange Land, full of wild men, were &s;o Religious; their End &s;o Holy; their Selfdenyal in pur&s;uing of it, &s;o Extraordinary; that I can't but hope that the Plantation has thereby gaind a very &s;trong Cra&s;is; and that it will not be of one or two, or three Centuries only; but very long la&s;ting.

Leagues at Sea, when they &s;prung a Leak; and the mo&s;t part of their Bread was damnified with the &s;alt water: and they could hardly free the Ship by pumping. Whereupon, le&s;t they &s;hould want provi&s;ions for &s;o long a Voyage, the Captain gave way to the de&s;ire of five of the Pa&s;&s;engers, to re|turn a&s;hoar in the Boat: which their Company regretted, for fear <HI>Villagagnon</HI> &s;hould do them a di&s;plea&s;ure. But they reckoned them|&s;elves &s;afe, having not given him cau&s;e of Offence; but Obligation. And &s;o with much grief on both &s;ides they took Leave; commending each other to the Keeping of God. Now being unprovided of Ma&s;t, Sail, and all manner of Tackling for the Boat; and of Skill to ma|nage it: twas with infinite difficulty and hazard, that they recovered the Land, and afterward, the I&s;land and Fortre&s;s of <HI>Colligny.</HI> They &s;peedily pre&s;ented them&s;elves to <HI>Villagagnon,</HI> and acquainted him with the Danger occa&s;ioning their Return: and prayd his Favour; fora&s;much as they cho&s;e to dwell with their Countrymen; and not with <HI>Portugals,</HI> or <HI>Indians</HI>: and had left their Wives and Children, to &s;erve him in this remote Land; which they were ready to do to the uttermo&s;t of their power, untill they might have opportunity of returning to <HI>France.</HI> The Governour &s;pake them fair; prai&s;ed God for their Deliverance: and &s;aid, that tho they left him upon di&s;con|tent,

and were now fallen into his power; yet he would leave Ven|geance to God, and by no means deny them Entertainment. How|ever, he refu&s;ed to let them make the be&s;t of their boat, to buy Ne|ce&s;&s;aries for recovery of their impaired health. And within a while, was filld with Jealou&s;ies, le&s;t all they had &s;aid was feigned; and that <HI>Corquillerius</HI> called <HI>du Pont, Richer</HI> and Company, with the help of tho&s;e gon to the River of <HI>Plate,</HI> upon notice given, would in one night &s;urpri&s;e the Fort, and de&s;troy him and his. Whether the&s;e Fears were real or pretended; he came to a re&s;olution to take them off as <HI>Traitors</HI>: But not finding how to make that Charge probable, he pitchd upon <HI>Religion,</HI> and drew up Articles for them to an&s;wer, as thinking &s;uch Sacrifices would be very plea&s;ing to the Court. The <HI>French</HI> of the Continent per&s;waded them not to give an account of their Faith to this Apo&s;tat Tyrant: but that they &s;hould rather hide them&s;elves among the <HI>Portugals,</HI> or <HI>Indians.</HI> But they were of Opi|nion that God calld them to bear witne&s;s for Him, and accordingly, <HI>John Bordel,</HI> who exceeded the re&s;t in Learning and Grace, as well as in Age, drew up in writing a Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, containing an An|&s;wer to the Articles. This they all read often, and di&s;tinctly weigh|ed each Article; and then all &s;ignd it. It begins thus: <HI>According to the Doctrine of St</HI> Peter <HI>the Apo&s;tle, in his fir&s;t Epistle; all Chri&s;tians ought always to be ready to give an account of the Hope that is in them, &amp;c.</HI></P>

No Villain! &s;aid he; you and your companions dye for no &s;uch things as the&s;e; but becau&s;e you are a mo&s;t dange|rous Pe&s;t to be &s;eparated from the Church, le&s;t you &s;poil the re&s;t of my company. The Martyr an&s;wered, Eight moneths are not pa&s;|&s;ed &s;ince you made an ample confe&s;&s;ion of the Points for which you make us dye this day. Afterward he petitioned him again for his life, offering to become his &s;ervant. <HI>V.</HI> &s;aid he had nothing for him to do: but he would think of it, if he would recant his Error. <HI>Ver|meil</HI> &s;eeing no hope given him, but what was de&s;tructive to his Sal|vation, became thereby re&s;olv'd in his mind, and Cryed out with a loud Voice, <HI>I had rather dye, to live eternally with the LORD: than to live a little while, and dye for ever with Satan.</HI> After he had made his Prayer upon the Rock, and commended his Soul to the Care of God, he freely delivered him&s;elf into the hands of the Executioner; and Crying out with a loud Voice, <HI>Lord Je&s;us! have mercy on me!</HI> He gave up the gho&s;t. <HI>Andrew la Fon</HI> had not &s;trength enough to climb up into this Rock of Martyrdom: but by Promi&s;es &amp; Threa|tenings, was drawn to &s;ome degree of Recantation: Or el&s;e was fa|voured by <HI>Villagagnon</HI> for the &s;ake of his Trade of a Tailor, which was very nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>But the bloody Sacrifice of <HI>Vil.</HI> is not yet ended: One Victim re|mains; <HI>viz. Peter Bourdon,</HI> who was left very &s;ick on the Continent. Villagagnon went him&s;elf thither, took one a&s;hoar with him. His fir&s;t &s;alutation to the poor &s;ick man was that he mu&s;t get up, and go into the boat. <HI>Bourdon</HI> would have excu&s;ed him&s;elf, from his ina|bility to do him any &s;ervice by rea&s;on of &s;ickne&s;s. Villagagnon told him, this was to cure him. The poor man not being able to &s;tand, much le&s;s go; he cau&s;ed him to be carried aboard. Villagagnon ask|ed whether he would &s;tand to the Confe&s;&s;ion he had &s;ignd. He an|&s;wered, he would con&s;ider of it. As &s;oon as they came a&s;hoar, the Executioner bound him without any more adoe, adverti&s;ing him to have a care of his Con&s;cience. <HI>Bourden</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that to be the place where his companions obtained the Victory over death; he re|commended his &s;oul to God, and Cryed with a loud Voice, <HI>Lord

On the other hand, the Church <HI>Revel.</HI> 11.19. is called the Temple of GOD, intimating that God had a more vi&s;ible, avowed, and immediat Hand in building this Temple.

Whereas God did but privatly, and partially favour the other. And that, many times, Not to &s;ave them from death (The Witne&s;&s;es mu&s;t be &s;lain) but to &s;trengthen them, and inable them to dye Triumphing. As it fared with Chri&s;t their Head. In this Divine Temple, <HI>the Ark of the Covenant is Seen:</HI> There's another difference. Mr. <HI>Mede</HI> conjectures it may be meant of Chri&s;t's Per&s;onal Appearance. See lib. 5. cap. 11. P. 1114. However, then it will &s;atisfactorily and plainly appear to the Saints, that God in Chri&s;t, is a God Keeping Covenant; a God of Truth, Fullfilling every good Word He hath &s;poken concer|ning his Cho&s;en, and concerning his Enemies. Then, and not till then, will it fully appear, that God is a faithfull Keeper of that Co|venant recorded <HI>Jerem.</HI> 31.31. and <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.8. The I&s;raelites had indeed &s;erved <HI>Baal,</HI> and not <HI>Jehovah</HI>: Therefore it was fit that God &s;hould carry it towards them as <HI>Baal</HI> did to his prophets, 1 <HI>Kings,</HI> 18.26. &mdash; 29.

<P>Upon the&s;e grounds, the forementioned Objection cea&s;eth to be cogent with me. And I am &s;o far from thinking that no Vial is yet poured forth; that I am apt to conclude, that no le&s;s than Five ANGELS have already poured out their Vials. So many gue&s;&s;es have been made about the Subject of the Fourth Vial; that if I do enter a claim for the Sun of <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> I &s;hall no more incur the danger of being extravagant, than &s;ome that have gone before me. Certainly, that is the Sun that con&s;olidates and cheri&s;hes the Anti-chri&s;tian State. As for the Fifth Vial; <HI>Bullinger, Brightman, Forbes, Pareus, Mede,</HI> and Company Interpreters of the <HI>Revelaton,</HI> have poured that to purpo&s;e.

And &s;eeing the Tower of <HI>Babel</HI> hath no other foundation than the Uncertain Vanity of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Pe|ter</HI>'s having been at <HI>Rome: Uldaricus Velenus</HI> did the <HI>Babylonians</HI> a &s;in|gular di&s;plea&s;ure in writing a Treati&s;e to prove that He was never there. <HI>Bellarmin. de Pontif. lib&punc;</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 1.

And <HI>Bellarmin</HI>'s arguing from <HI>Peter</HI>'s Tomb, is un&s;ound. For it was cu&s;tomary at <HI>Rome,</HI> to make Funeral Solemnitys, and erect Monuments for per&s;ons dying abroad. <HI>Alcyone</HI> re&s;olved to pay that Re&s;pect to her husband <HI>Ceyx,</HI> who was lo&s;t at Sea. <HI>Ovid</HI> Metamor. lib. 11. &amp; lib. 12. princip.

How ea&s;y was it for the modern <HI>Romans</HI> to make u&s;e of this Cu&s;tom when it might &s;erve their turn.

But becau&s;e they would not all at one time, range them&s;elves under the power of &s;o mighty Princes, they declined it. The Pope's chief hope was in <HI>Francis</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King, who had been Cae&s;ars Pri&s;oner but a little before; and now the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> were in his hand as Ho&s;tages.

<P>Upon all, or &s;ome of the&s;e Con&s;iderations, it &s;eems to me probable that Five of the Vials are already poured out. Not but that they hold on their cour&s;e &s;till; and will do &s;o, untill the Confluence of them all do with irre&s;i&s;tible Force ingulf Antichri&s;tiani&s;me in utter Ruine. The truth is, all the Vials may in &s;ome &s;ence be &s;aid to have been poured out together at the beginning of this Period of <HI>Rome</HI>'s gradual Decay. Yet there are critical Times, and characteri&s;tical pa&s;&s;ages of divine Providence, wherein each Vial obtains the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Regen|cy app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inted them of Chri&s;t. And the Sixth Angel &s;eems now to &s;tand ready with his Vial, waiting only for the Word to be given for the pouring of it out The pouring out of this Vial will dry up the Antichri&s;tian Intere&s;ts in the New World: and thereby prepare the way for the Kings of the Ea&s;t. This is agreeable to the analogy of Interpretation generally given by the Ancients; and more lately by <HI>Bullinger, Pare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, Cowper,</HI> and many others. Only as <HI>Euphrates</HI> is one individual River, &s;o tis &s;uitable to limit it to this Continent; thereby to keep it as it were within its banks. There is an harmony between the Third and Sixth Vials. In the pouring out of that, the Antichri&s;tian Rivers were made bloody, by the Civil, and Military Sword: By the pouring out of this, the Great River is wholly dryed up; &s;o that Nothing of it is left remaining to make <HI>Babylon</HI> glad.

Con&s;equently, the <HI>Armagedduntine</HI> Expedition will &s;ome way re&s;em|ble that of 1588. Only it will be much greater, and more fatal to the principal Undertakers. Mr. <HI>Brightman</HI> couples <HI>Revelation,</HI> 16.16. with <HI>Daniel,</HI> 11.45. So that if the genuine &s;ence of that place hath been given, we know where to look for the drying up of <HI>Euphrates.</HI> And to make the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire the &s;ubject of the Sixth Vial, &s;eems heterogeneous: For <HI>Euphrates</HI> mu&s;t needs be parcel of the Waters upon which the Whore &s;its at the time when this great River comes to be dried up: Which the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s will do, by cau|&s;ing &s;o much of her dominion to cea&s;e for ever. The Pope and his followers, by warring again&s;t the <HI>Turk,</HI> do not dry up <HI>Euphrates</HI>: but do inlarge the <HI>Papal,</HI> by the diminution of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. And although the pa&s;&s;ing away of the &s;econd Wo be matter of uni|ver&s;al Joy; yet to make it to be the drying up of <HI>Euphrates,</HI> &s;eems hard: For the Sixth Vial doth not carry off an <HI>Old</HI> Plague; but brings on a <HI>New</HI> one. Neither did I ever hear that the Reformed Churches fared &s;o much the better for the taking of <HI>Buda,</HI> as to make me think that <HI>Euphrates</HI> was then partly dried up. Moreover this is a new accommodation. The fir&s;t that I find of it, is in Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> p. 373. Probably, if he had met with it before, he would have men|tiond it; that being his profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign, Praefat. p. 6.

<P>The&s;e are the Sentiments of Mr. <HI>Nicolas Fuller</HI> concerning the New World, and them that dwell therein; both as to what is pa&s;t, and to come. If they do but outlive the &s;pringing of this Mine, they are like to be out of danger of any further de&s;ign this Chapter hath upon them. This learned Man, agreeable to his great Ingenuity, endea|vours to do <HI>Columbus</HI> the Ju&s;tice, as to eternize his Honour, by engra|ving his Name upon the World of his Di&s;covery. <HI>It is every where called</HI> America: <HI>but according to Truth, and De&s;ert; men &s;hould rather call it</HI> Columbina, <HI>from the magnanimous Heroe</HI> Chri&s;topher Columbus <HI>a</HI> Genue&s;e, <HI>who was manifestly Appointed of GOD to be the Finder out of the&s;e Lands.</HI> But why &s;hould a learned Man make all this <HI>Dirige</HI> for <HI>Columbus</HI>'s Name! What matter is it how <HI>America</HI> be called? For <HI>Flavio</HI> of <HI>Malphi</HI> in <HI>Naples</HI> hath, in great mea&s;ure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1300.</NOTE> applied the Vertues of the Load&s;tone to the Mariners Compa&s;s, <HI>in Vain</HI>; the <HI>Portugals</HI> have found the length of <HI>Africa</HI>'s foot, <HI>in Vain</HI>; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ent out the <HI>Italian</HI> Dove, <HI>in Vain</HI>; Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> hath &s;ailed round the World, and made thorow Lights to it, <HI>in Vain</HI>; and <HI>Hakluyt</HI> and <HI>Purchas</HI> have, with endle&s;s Labour, acquainted <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> with the&s;e Things, in Vain: If after all, we go about to turn the <HI>American Eu|phrates</HI> into a <HI>Stygian</HI> Lake!

<P>Another thing that Mr. <HI>Fuller</HI> drives at, is, he would fain have it believ'd, that <HI>America</HI> was fir&s;t peopled by the Po&s;terity of our Great Grandfather <HI>JAPHETH</HI>; tho he will not be very &s;trict with us, as to the particular branch of that Wide Family; as the Breadth of his <HI>Parenthe&s;is</HI> &s;hews.

of the 2<HI>d</HI> Part contains Motives to Go&s;pellize the Heathen, &s;uch as the <HI>Indians</HI> are.
