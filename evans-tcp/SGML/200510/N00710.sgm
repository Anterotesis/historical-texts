<P>IF ever there was a time when God &s;o|lemnly calls his Servants to <HI>Cry aloud and not to &s;pare, but &s;hew his People their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions,</HI> it is now, when <HI>Iniquity &s;o abounds and love waxeth &s;o cold.</HI> And as the <HI>Philo&s;opher</HI> once &s;aid, that <HI>Evil manners occa&s;ion the making of good Laws</HI>; So the hor|rid wickedne&s;s of &s;ome notorious &s;inners, gives occa&s;ion for the Preaching of Sermons more peculiarly &s;erviceable for the row&s;ing and a|wakning of &s;ecure ones, and loudly calling them to Repentance; when God toucheth the hearts of his Mini&s;ters, with a feeling &s;en&s;e of the danger of, and tender compa&s;&s;ion towards
<PB REF="000856_0003_0FABB3050FE8C8D0">
tho&s;e that are going without regard in the path of de&s;truction. That which gave birth to the en&s;uing <HI>SERMONS,</HI> was the prodigious example of a forlorn young Crea|ture, that had defiled her &s;elf with Whoredoms, and been the unhappy mother of two illegi|timate children &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and became the barbarous Murderer of the latter of them; for which Crime, &s;he there &s;tood under a &s;entence of Death, upon due Conviction, and that before &s;he had &s;een full Nineteen years in the World: and for the which &s;he hath been &s;ince righteou&s;ly executed. My Soul was the more deeply affected with her condition, <HI>partly,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he belonged to my Flock, and had received the Seal of the Covenant from my hands, and was under my Charge; in which I could not but feel an heart thrilling rebuke in the Holy Providence of God: <HI>Partly</HI> becau&s;e of the mo&s;t amazing, and &s;carce paralel'd induration of heart, and tremendous Wickedne&s;s which &s;he di&s;covered in and under her Impri&s;onment, to the deep con&s;ternation of all &s;erious ones that were acquainted there|withall. Which will, I hope, plead &s;ufficiently for the &s;uitablene&s;s of the Subjects treated of, and the &s;everity of the Words u&s;ed in the pro&s;ecution of them. <HI>But &s;he is now gone, and hath given up her account to the Judge of all.</HI> Yet her example remains, and &s;tands for the

Warning of others. And doubtle&s;s God ex|pects that <HI>the living &s;hould lay it to heart,</HI> and learn le&s;&s;ons of Caution thereby. I have there|fore endeavoured, according to the Grace given me, to Level the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es for the Admonition of others, lea&s;t they al&s;o provoke a Sin hating God, to give them up to be more a&s;toni&s;hing Mo|numents of his righteous &s;everity. And there are, I fear, <HI>more abominations</HI> as great as the&s;e, which have not yet &s;een the light; and may her example, and the&s;e warnings drawn forth by it, drive &s;uch to a timely Repentance, and ma|king of their peace with God. Let young Ones more e&s;pecially learn by her, <HI>To Remem|ber their Creator early,</HI> and beware of &s;uch &s;ins as were leading to the bringing of her to a fearful end; in particular let all Children, and &s;uch as are under the Command of Parents and Family Government, beware of di&s;obedi|ence to their Parents, and tho&s;e that have the Authority over them; let them be warned to take heed to them&s;elves of being linked in vain company, and take the wi&s;e mans coun&s;el, Prov. 1.10. <HI>My Son, if Sinners entice thee con&s;ent thou not.</HI> Let them beware of <HI>prophaning Gods Holy Sabbaths:</HI> of unnece&s;&s;ary ab&s;enting them|&s;elves from the Wor&s;hip of God in his Hou&s;e, or neglecting of any opportunities of attending on his Holy Ordinances; and let them be advi&s;ed <HI>to keep their feet when they come to the

Hou&s;e of God,</HI> and not &s;uffer their hearts to wander into the corners of the earth, when they &s;hould be learning what God the Lord hath to &s;ay unto them.

Our <HI>Text</HI> is one of tho&s;e &s;hafts taken out of Gods quiver, and &s;hot at every unregenerate Soul; and Oh! that they might be throughly wounded by it. The words before us are an a&s;&s;ertion delivered by the mouth of Truth it &s;elf, and may well terrify and amaze every Chri&s;tle&s;s Soul. In them we may ob&s;erve two things. 1. The <HI>Subject</HI> &s;poken of, <HI>the fooli&s;h</HI>: I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on the various u&s;ages of this word in Scriptures; it is &s;ometimes improved in a good &s;en&s;e; and &s;ometimes it is made u&s;e of in a bad &s;en&s;e; and in this latter it is here: and thus it is frequently u&s;ed for a <HI>Fool,</HI> or a <HI>Mad-man</HI>: and therefore many tran&s;lations read it, <HI>In&s;ani</HI>; the mad or di&s;tracted; men that are out of their wits 2.

To &s;tand then in Gods &s;ight, or before his eyes, intends an enjoying of, or being &s;ettled in his favour.

<P><HI>All impenitent Sinners are fooli&s;h and mad, and therefore &s;hall not &s;tand in Gods &s;ight; which will render them extreamly mi&s;erable.</HI></P>
<P>There are three Propo&s;itions contained in this Doctrine.</P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> I. That all impenitent Sinners are fooli&s;h and mad.</P>
<P>There are a &s;ort of per&s;ons in the world, whom God in his word, is plea&s;ed to put the Character of fools and mad men upon, who are neither naturals, or void of the u&s;e of rea&s;on, con&s;idered as men; nor yet bereft of their under&s;tandings, through occa&s;ional dotage or frenzy in that re|&s;pect: and who are they? we have a &s;ummary account of them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 4.22. <HI>My people is fooli&s;h, they have not known me, they are &s;otti&s;h Children, and they have no under&s;tanding; they are wi&s;e to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</HI> The &s;umm
<PB N="4" REF="000856_0010_0FABB309B651D688">
is, <HI>all &s;inners,</HI> remaining in their natural e&s;tate belong to this Character; and hence <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Folly</HI> are, in Scripture, terms equivalent. Here we may, in particular, briefly come at this in three &s;teps.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>All &s;in is folly.</HI> And hence &s;o much &s;in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 word"> remains in the Godly, &s;o much fooli&s;hne&s;s there abides with them. This the P&s;almi&s;t confe&s;&s;eth of him&s;elf, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 69 5. <HI>O God, thou knowest my fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI> Every time a per&s;on commits any &s;in, he hath ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;ay of him&s;elf, as he, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 26.21. <HI>I have &s;inned, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</HI> And it mu&s;t needs be &s;o, for every &s;in is an act of di&s;obedience to that God, on whom we have our entire dependence, and to whom we owe our &s;elves and our whole lives: it is an act of rebellion again&s;t that God whom we are bound to &s;ubject our &s;elves unto, and is able to de&s;troy us for that rebellion. It is a <HI>for&s;aking the fountain of living waters, and digging of broken Ci&s;terns that can hold no water.</HI> Jer. 2.12. It is a <HI>preferring of lying vanities before everla&s;ting Mercies.</HI> Jer. 2.8. It is a <HI>provoking of God to jea|lou&s;y.</HI> 1 Cor. 10.22. And we are not &s;tronger than he. It is an entring of the li&s;ts of contention with him, <HI>a running upon him, even his neek, on the thick bo&s;&s;es of his buckler,</HI> Job. 15.26. It is for a worm to bid a challenge to Omnipotency it &s;elf: yea, what &s;hall I &s;ay? there are uncountable fol|lies attend the commi&s;&s;ion of every &s;in; and no wi&s;dom at all.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="000856_0011_0FABB30A80EFF5B0">2. <HI>That hence all they that are under the Dominion of Sin, are egregious fools.</HI> There is folly cleaving to the be&s;t of Gods Children here, as long as they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> body of death to carry about with them; and it &s;hews it &s;elf in every &s;tirring of the corrupt <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> but yet they have the principles of the true wi&s;dom in them; they are &s;uch as are made wi&s;e to Salvation. But as for tho&s;e in whom there are no &s;eeds of &s;aving Grace &s;own, but they yet remain in their natural e&s;tate, folly is bound up in their hearts, &amp; they have no other principle in them As to their <HI>Under&s;tandings,</HI> they are fool|i&s;h and perver&s;e, they <HI>call evil good, and good e|vil.</HI> I&s;ai. 5.20. As to their <HI>Wills</HI> and <HI>Affections,</HI> they are engaged. Eccl. 8.11. <HI>The heart of the &s;ons of men is fully &s;et in them to do evil.</HI> They do no|thing at all with a &s;incere aim at the glory of God, and the furtherance of their own &s;alvation: yea, their whole life is a continual progre&s;s in the way that leads to de&s;truction; hence we have that put into their de&s;cription, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.16, 17. <HI>De|&s;truction and mi&s;ery are in their ways: and the way of Peace have they not known.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That Impenitent Sinners are the greate&s;t fools of all.</HI> The Word of God often u&s;eth the&s;e words [<HI>Sinners, Fools, Wicked</HI>] emphatically, for &s;uch as are peculiarly &s;o: and then it intends either, (1.) Such as live in mo&s;t notorious and prodigious &s;ins; thus a common Whore is called a Sinner more than once in the Go&s;pel: or (2.) Such as remain ob&s;tinate and impenitent in their

Sins under, and notwith&s;tanding means u&s;ed to win them to repentance <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ow the means u&s;ed with them are of two &s;orts. (1.) Such as are afford|ed to the Gentiles, who have not the Go&s;pel, <HI>viz.</HI> the light of a natural Con&s;cience, and the com|mon &s;trivings of the Spirit of God in them; they are therefore &s;aid to be a <HI>Law to them&s;elves, and their Con&s;ciences to bear witne&s;s, and either to accu&s;e or excu&s;e, Rom.</HI> 2.14, 15. and the Providences of God, which ought to be improved by that light, to excite them to repentance: thus the <HI>Goodne&s;s of God</HI> is &s;aid to <HI>lead to it, Rom.</HI> 2.4. and his com|mon benefits are called <HI>witne&s;&s;es, Acts</HI> 14.17. <HI>his Judgments</HI> al&s;o are <HI>that the Inhabitants of the World may learn righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> I&s;a. 26.9. (2) Such as tho&s;e enjoy who &s;it under the means of Grace, where|in God &s;hews them the evil and danger of their &s;ins, and not only invites them to Repentance, but al&s;o gives them all &s;uitable directions, and the greate&s;t imaginable encouragements to help them in it; and the&s;e are afforded to &s;uch as are in the Covenant with him, P&s;al. 147.19, 20. <HI>he &s;heweth his word to Jacob, his statutes and judgments to I&s;rael: he hath not dealt &s;o with any nation.</HI> Impenitence in the former of the&s;e is a note of inexcu&s;able fol|ly; and &s;o it is charged on their <HI>fooli&s;h minds, Rom.</HI> 1.21. how much more then may it be im|puted to the latter, and their folly be reputed the <HI>Paroxi&s;m</HI> of madne&s;s? ina&s;much as they have a price in their hands, and have not an heart to make u&s;e of it; and whence is that, but becau&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="000856_0013_0FABB30F25BFAE58">
they are fools; according to, Prov. 17.16. <HI>Where|fore is there a price in the hands of a fool to get wi&s;|dom, &s;eeing he hath no heart to it?</HI> they have life and death &s;et before them, and they chu&s;e death; they have the way to e&s;cape the Wrath of God, and obtain Eternal Life, and regard it not; they are told whicher their &s;inful cour&s;es do lead, and where they will end, and yet they will take no warnings, but run wilfully and violently on to their own de&s;truction, like that fool, Prov. 7.22, 23. <HI>he goeth after her &s;traitway, as the ex goeth to the &s;laughter, and as a fool to the correction of the Stocks, till a dart &s;trike through his liver, as a bird hacteth to the &s;nare, and knoweth not that it is for his life</HI>; they are invited and entreated to be recon|ciled unto God, and to put away their &s;ins by repentance, and they mind it not, but &s;top their ears, and harden their hearts, &amp; turn their backs; they have a day of vi&s;itation, in which the <HI>things of their peace</HI> are &s;et before them, and <HI>do not know it</HI>; they &s;ee others of their fellow &s;inners cut off by Gods awful Judgments, and it makes no im|pre&s;&s;ion upon them: yea, they them&s;elves are brought to &s;orrow and &s;hame; and &s;till they will not be reclaimed: and were not <HI>madne&s;s in their heart,</HI> could they do &s;o?</P>
<P><HI>Prop. II.</HI> That therefore &s;uch Sinners &s;hall not &s;tand in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>Could that <HI>Philistian</HI> Prince &s;ay, 1 Sam. 21.14,

15. <HI>the man is mad, wherefore then have ye hrought him to me? have I need of mad men</HI>? &amp;c. and will not God declare as much concerning the&s;e? yea, he hath &s;aid it, Text. Here two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That no &s;uch as the&s;e &s;hall &s;tand in Gods &s;ight. That this is &s;o, our <HI>Text</HI> fully a&s;&s;erts, and many other parallel <HI>Scriptures</HI> confirm. All that lies before us at pre&s;ent, is to con&s;ider what is im|plied in this. The words are a threatning, and indeed a very awful one, as will pre&s;ently appear. Here then let it be ob&s;erved, that the expre&s;&s;ion may refer either to the time pre&s;ent, or that which is to come.</P>
<P N="1">1. With re&s;pect to the time pre&s;ent; and then it intends that God will cut &s;hort their lives, and hurry them out of the World before they &s;hould have died, according to the ordinary cour&s;e of nature; hence we read, P&s;al. 55.23. <HI>bloody and deeeitful men &s;hall not live out half their days</HI>; and Eccle&s;. 7.17. <HI>be not wicked overmuch, why &s;hould&s;t thou dy before the time?</HI> It is a common favour which God allows to men as he &s;ees meet, to &s;pare them, and let them fill up their number of dayes; whereas &s;uch fools have rea&s;on to expect to be debarred of this priviledge, and po&s;ted a|way before hand. But I in&s;i&s;t not here, though this al&s;o affords matter of awful con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="2">2. With re&s;pect to the time to come: and then to &s;tand in Gods &s;ight, intends to enjoy his &s;pecial favour and love, and we have this infelicity ex|pounded in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 27.11, and there are two &s;ea&s;ons
<PB N="9" REF="000856_0015_0FABB31059942438">
wherein they &s;hall be debarred of this favour.</P>

to be in the &s;tate mentioned, P&s;al. 7.11. <HI>God is angry with the wicked every day</HI>; to have the Arm of Divine Vengeance up, with the glittering Sword of revenging Ju&s;tice, ready to give him the deadly &s;troak&punc; to have nothing before him but a fearful expectation of fiery indignation which &s;hall devour him, when it lights upon him; in the fulne&s;s of his &s;trength and folly, to fall up|on him, and &s;end him down to the pit of endle&s;s mi&s;ery; &s;uch is the condition of impenitent &s;in|ners at the be&s;t; read at lei&s;ure, Job 18.5. to end, and you &s;hall find it there a&s;toni&s;hingly de&s;cribed, and &s;ee 1 The&s;. 5.3. <HI>when they &s;hall &s;ay, peace and &s;afety, then &s;udden de&s;truction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they &s;hall not e&s;cape.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. You are all fooli&s;h in your natural e&s;tate. Whatever vain opinion you have of your own

<P N="2">2. If you live and dy &s;uch, you &s;hall never &s;tand in Gods &s;ight; your doom is determined and pronounced: and you have the rea&s;on given in the words following our Text, <HI>thou hatest all the workers of Iniquity.</HI> And if God hates you, you have rea&s;on to expect that he will &s;eparate you from his pre&s;ence.

<P N="3">3. God affords you the means of grace as a remedy to cure you of your fooli&s;hne&s;s: The great de&s;ign of the Go&s;pel and Ordinances, is to &s;hew men the right way, to recover of their mad|ne&s;s, and be made wi&s;e.

they that have them not mu&s;t needs <HI>dy without knowledge,</HI> it is the main de&s;ign of the means to point us to this; God gives <HI>Pa&s;tors to feed men with knowledge and under&s;tanding,</HI> Jer. 3.15. What he &s;aith of his <HI>Proverbs,</HI> may be applyed to the whole book of God, <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.3; 4. <HI>To know wi&s;|dom, and instruction,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. If you peri&s;h in your impenitency under the&s;e means, you will never be cured. Sinners, by their hardne&s;s of heart, with&s;tand the efficacy of the Word and Ordinances; and when once it comes to that, that &s;inners do practically &s;ay, as they did expre&s;sly, Jer. 44.16. <HI>As to the word which thou &s;peake&s;t to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee</HI>; their ca&s;e is next to de&s;perate We have God therefore expo&s;tu|lating with &s;uch, P&s;al. 94.8. <HI>Ye fools, when will you be wi&s;e?</HI> The&s;e are the only means which God hath appointed to bring &s;inners to their right minds; and if the operation be contrary, it argues their ca&s;e to be deplorable.

It will be a dread|ful thing to lo&s;e Gods pre&s;ence for ever, though now you can &s;ay unto him <HI>depart,</HI> yet when it comes to be your lot indeed to lo&s;e all your hope of his favour, this will be unconceivable bit<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">er|ne&s;s:

and nothing will make it more bitter than to think, I had a day of Grace, wi&s;dom him&s;elf pleaded with me, &s;tretched out his hands all the day long to me; I heard the precious truths of the Go&s;pel, I was told of my mi&s;erable &s;tate, en|treated to con&s;ider of it, offered help out of it; was waited upon with line upon line, &s;triven with, both by Parents, and Godly friends, and faithful Mini&s;ters, and by the Spirit him&s;elf together with them: I was told what it would come to; and yet I de&s;pi&s;ed, I &s;corned, I would have mine own ways, and grew the more re&s;olute in them, and now I am but <HI>filled with my own devices, and made to eat of the fruit of my own ways</HI>: and how dreadful an eccho of Con&s;cience will this be? and yet we are told that thus it will be in the end, <HI>Prov.</HI> 5.11. &amp;c. <HI>and thou mourn at la&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and &s;ay, how have I hated in&s;truction, and my heart de&s;pi&s;ed reproof?</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="6">6. Hence think what a doom is ha&s;tning upon you, and what an execution will follow that. You mu&s;t very &s;hortly appear before God; your day of Grace will &s;oon be at an end; the time is drawing near when God will &s;ay that his Spirit &s;hall &s;trive no more with you; the <HI>ax</HI> which <HI>lyeth at the root all</HI> this while, will <HI>cut you down,</HI> you mu&s;t hear your terrible Judge &s;ay, <HI>depart from me, I know thee not, thou worker of iniquity:</HI> and when that word is once pa&s;t, the &s;entence will take place.

<P>And to that end,</P>
<P N="1">1. Be convinced of your folly and madne&s;s. As long as you are wi&s;e in your own e&s;teem, there is no hope that ever you &s;hould be &s;o indeed; or &s;o much as comply with the means that are made u&s;e of to render you &s;o; it is the remark in, Prov. 26.12. <HI>Seest thou a man that is wi&s;e in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.

And think how unrea&s;onable a thing it is to chu&s;e Sin before Holine&s;s, to pre|fer unprofitable vanities, before the glories of the everla&s;ting Kingdom: to gratify your lu&s;ts, and undoe your Souls; for a few moments plea&s;ure, in the gratification of the &s;en&s;es, to &s;uffer eternal &s;eparation from God, and the fearful impre&s;&s;ions of his in&s;upportable wrath.</P>
<P N="2">2. Deeply re&s;ent your danger. Think it not a &s;mall and incon&s;iderable thing to lo&s;e Gods gra|cious pre&s;ence; and take heed of counting it a light matter to be thru&s;t out of it, after all the offers of it that have been made to you, and ad|vantages that have been put into your hands to

<P N="3">3. Be often pondering what a God you have to do withall. <HI>He is a great and a terrible God</HI>; if you lo&s;e his favour, and procure his anger to burn upon you, you will certainly fall before it. What &s;aith he? P&s;al. 76.7. <HI>Thou, even those art to be feared; and who may &s;tand in thy &s;ight when once thou art angry?

He is a <HI>True God,</HI> and faithful to his threatnings as well as to his promi&s;es, and if he hath &s;aid, that the <HI>fooli&s;h &s;hall not &s;tand in his &s;ight,</HI> let all impenitent &s;inners look to them&s;elves, for they &s;hall find that the <HI>Strength of I&s;rael is not a man that he &s;houldly, or a &s;on of man, that he &s;hould repent.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Let the con&s;ideration of all this make you ha&s;ty, and in earne&s;t to fly to God for his <HI>Spirit</HI>

and <HI>Grace</HI> to make you wi&s;e.

<Q><BIBL><HI>Hebr. IX.27.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash; And after this the Judgment.</P></Q>
<P>THIS Ver&s;e is the <HI>prota&s;is</HI> of a compari|&s;on which the <HI>Apostle</HI> makes u&s;e of in his Di&s;cour&s;e; which needs not for the pre&s;ent be in&s;i&s;ted on, or laid open, in as much as we have now to do but with the ge|neral Doctrine contained in the words them&s;elves. Among all tho&s;e things which men are invited to the &s;erious contemplation of, there are none
<PB N="30" REF="000856_0036_0FABB32925F44B18">
that carry more of &s;olemnity in them, than tho&s;e of <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI>: becau&s;e the former of the&s;e puts an end to mans life and time, and op|portunities; and the other di&s;po&s;eth them to an Everla&s;ting and Unchangeable E&s;tate. Death it &s;elf is &s;tiled a <HI>King of Terrours</HI> in the Holy Scrip|tures; and the <HI>Philo&s;opher</HI> could call it, <HI>[TON PHOBERON PHOBERATAION] of fearful things, the mo&s;t fearful</HI>; but that which adds to the tremendou&s;ne&s;s of it, is that it is a pa&s;&s;age to the great and la&s;t Judgment, which the ignorant <HI>Gentiles</HI> had but dark notice of; but is evidently manife&s;ted in the Word of God, which we <HI>Chri|stians</HI> are favoured withal. The ver&s;e before us, gives us an intimation of both the&s;e, and of the certainty of them, as things which are appointed. The word [<HI>appointed</HI>] &s;ignifies both a <HI>de&s;ignation,</HI> &amp; a <HI>re&s;ervation</HI> of a thing; notifying that, as there is an Eternal purpo&s;e for it in the Decree of God, &s;o it is his fixt and unchangeable will that it &s;hall &s;o be; and accordingly all men are re&s;erved for it. It is the latter of the&s;e &s;tatutes then that I am now to treat of, though with that re&s;pect as it is con&s;equent upon the former. In the words then, there are three things to be ob&s;erved:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) A Statute for the Judgment is a&s;&s;erted; and thereby we are a&s;&s;ured that it &s;hall be with|out fail; for the appointment mentioned in the beginning of the <HI>ver&s;e</HI> hath reference to this as well as to death; and this is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t proper &s;ignification of the word.</P>
<P N="2"><PB REF="000856_0037_0FABB329E4F9A708">(2.) The time when it &s;hall be, <HI>after</HI> that men dy. And although we are not told how &s;oon it &s;hall be after, yet we have Scripture war|rant to conclude, that every ones per&s;onal Judg|ment will follow pre&s;ently upon it; though the great and general Judgment is re&s;erved until the con&s;ummation of all things, as will be farther ob&s;erved anon.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The &s;ubjects of it, or who they are on whom this Judgment &s;hall pa&s;s: <HI>men,</HI> indefinitely expre&s;&s;ed; it intends all men: this Judgment is as exten&s;ive as Death; yea there have been, &amp; will be &s;ome exceptions from the general Rule about Death, who have been tran&s;lated, or &s;hall be changed; but even the&s;e al&s;o &s;hall come to the Judgment.</P>
<P>Hence,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A certain Death &s;hall be followed with as certain a Judgment. It is every whit as certain that men &s;hall come unto Judgment, as that they &s;hall Dye.</HI></P>
<P>That every one mu&s;t dy &s;ooner or later, is an acknowledged truth by all, and proved by uni|ver&s;al experience: though, Oh how few do im|prove it to good purpo&s;e? And a rea&s;on why this truth hath no more proper or &s;uitable impre&s;|&s;ions on mens minds, may be becau&s;e, either they believe not, or put from them the thoughts of
<PB N="32" REF="000856_0038_0FABB32BB67A6D28">
the en&s;uing account which they &s;hall be called unto, and look no further than the Grave, where they think there will be an end of them, which mu&s;t needs make them unconcerned for that which comes after. But here we are led into the contemplation of a more awful truth, which is no le&s;s real, though not &s;o obvious to the &s;en&s;es. I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent enter upon any di&s;tinct or methodical di&s;cour&s;e about this matter, but only make &s;ome cur&s;ory glances on it. There are therefore three or four brief <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> which I &s;hall make on this truth, to make it practicable.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> That there is a <HI>future Judgment</HI> to which all rea&s;onable Creatures &s;hall be called. How far the Doctrine of a future Judgment hath been en|tertained by the light of nature, in the Con&s;ciences of men acted by humane rea&s;on, without the help of Scripture revelation, I &s;hall not now en|quire. But that it is an Article of faith, com|mended to us by the infallible Oracles of that God who cannot ly, or be mi&s;taken, is written with Sun beams in his word. Read for this, Eccle&s;. 12.14. <HI>God will bring every work into Judgment with every &s;ecret thing, whether it be good or evil.</HI> Acts 17.31. <HI>he hath appointed a day in which he will Judge the World in righteou&s;ne&s;s, by the man whom he hath appointed.</HI> 2 Cor. 5 10. <HI>we mu&s;t all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chri&s;t, that every one may receive the things done in the body</HI>; and we have a de&s;cription of it
<PB N="33" REF="000856_0039_0FABB32C5074C4C0">
given to us by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, in <HI>Math.</HI> 25.33, <HI>to end.</HI> And it mu&s;t need be &s;o for, there is a <HI>&s;pe|cial Government</HI> of God, to be acknowledged, in the managment whereof he will bring all rea&s;o|nable Creatures to an everla&s;ting &s;tate of happi|ne&s;s or mi&s;ery, according to their Obedience or Di&s;obedience to the Law of that Government, in pro&s;ecution whereof he will di&s;play the Glory of his <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Grace.</HI> God deals with his Crea|tures in his Government, according to the nature which he &s;aw meet to be&s;tow on them in their Creation. Now when God Created man, he made him a rea&s;onable Creature, and thereby ca|pable of being treated in the way of a Covenant, by precepts and promi&s;es, and threatnings; ac|cording unto which capacity, he gave him a Command, and required his obedience to it; promi&s;ed him a reward of life, in ca&s;e of his per|forming of perfect Obedience thereunto; de|nouncing Death again&s;t him in ca&s;e he &s;hould di&s;|obey. He hath al&s;o, upon mans <HI>Apo&s;ta&s;y</HI> by which he fell under a Cur&s;e of <HI>Death,</HI> revealed to him <HI>a new and a living way</HI> for his recovery out of that mi&s;ery into which he was plunged; and hath treated &s;ome of that race with a <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> in which he hath promi&s;ed them life upon their compliance with it, and menaced them with damnation, yea <HI>double damnation,</HI> on their neglect of it. All the&s;e things are abundantly te&s;tified to in the Word of God: Now men are, according to their behaviour, with re&s;pect to this di&s;covery
<PB N="34" REF="000856_0040_0FABB32CD7656528">
which God hath made of him&s;elf to man, and obligation which he hath laid him under, di&s;po|&s;ed of everla&s;tingly: In order unto which they are to pa&s;s under a <HI>Trial.</HI> Where there is a Law given to rea&s;onable Creatures, e&s;tabli&s;hed with Sanctions, there mu&s;t needs be a Judgment, in which their relation thereto is to be examined, and a retribution made to them accordingly.

<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> That this Judgment is after Death; this is the order that it is manife&s;tly put in, <HI>Text.</HI> That there are many awful and &s;tupendous <HI>Judgments</HI> that God brings upon men in this world, is not to be denied; in which he declares his Holine&s;s and ju&s;t Indignation at &s;in; and hence we are told, P&s;al. 9.14. <HI>The Lord is known by the Judgment that he executeth.</HI> There is al&s;o a Court which God hath &s;et up in mens <HI>Con&s;ciences,</HI> at which Bar they are &s;ometimes &s;olemnly tried, and being there convicted of breaking the Holy Law of God, &amp;
<PB N="35" REF="000856_0041_0FABB32D9B5861A8">
laying them&s;elves open to the vengeance therein threatned, they are filled with horrors. But it is another Judgment whereof we are now con&s;ider|ing, in which men are to appear before God, and receive from him their final doom, which, when it is once pa&s;t, &s;hall be immediately put in Execu|tion. Now this men come not to in this life, but after they are dead; &s;o that death is not, as too many vainly dream, the la&s;t news that &s;hall be heard of men, but there is &s;omething more fear|ful and amazing that comes after it, and that is the Judgment. There is <HI>a Judgment to come</HI>; &s;o <HI>Paul</HI> Preached to <HI>Faelix,</HI> at the report whereof he <HI>trembled,</HI> Acts 24.25. and when is that, but when men are pa&s;t from time, and have done the work which they were engaged in in this life? while men are in this world, conver&s;ant in the body, they are upon probation for Etetnity, they are laying in, and making way for their account, and all that they do here bears a proper re&s;pect there|unto; for they are <HI>the works which are done in the body,</HI> which mu&s;t be called to an after reckoning, 2 Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> 10. hence &s;inners are &s;aid in this time to be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> up unto them&s;elves wrath against the day of wrath, Rom.</HI> 2 5.

It is for the pre&s;ent a day of patience &amp; forbearance with which God &s;ees meet to treat men, even the wor&s;t of men withal, in which he lets them alone for a while, &amp; &s;uffers them to go on, till they have filled up their mea&s;ure: and though they give him uncountable and very grievous provocations, yet he falls not upon them. But yet he is brought in laughing at them all the while, and we are told the rea&s;on of it, P&s;al 37.13. <HI>The Lord &s;hall laugh at him, for he &s;eeth that his day is coming.</HI> Since then men are not called to their reckoning here, it remains that they be &s;ummoned to it afterwards; ina&s;much as it is certain, that God will &s;ooner or later manife&s;t the glory of his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and make it known that he is the great <HI>Potentate</HI> and Ruler of Angels and men.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> That there is a particular Judgment to which every man &s;hall be called immediately after Death.

This is an indubitable truth, that the Soul of man doth not dy a proper natural Death; nor is it capable of it. The man indeed is &s;aid to die, by rea&s;on of the di&s;&s;olution of the bond of Union, and the &s;eparation which is thereupon made between the Soul and Body, whereupon the body remains a Carca&s;e, and mu&s;t &s;uffer Corruption, after which there mu&s;t be a powerful Re&s;urrection be&s;towed on it, in or|der to its being made capable of &s;tanding forth in Judgment.

But this thought, if it be rightly entertained, will be a &s;trong curb to &s;in, and a &s;harp &s;pur to duty, inas|much as it mu&s;t needs lead mens thoughts for|ward to &s;uch meditations as the&s;e: There is cer|tainly a future Judgment, in which I am per&s;o|nally concerned. I am Gods Creature, and am placed under the Rule of his &s;pecial Government, and intere&s;ted in the Sanctions of his Holy Law. I am now a probationer for that day, and all that I am doing in this world hath a reference unto that, and mu&s;t come under the &s;trict examen of it. Every thought of mine heart, every word of my mouth, and every deed that I do, will then be called over, and tryed whether it be con|formable to, or di&s;&s;onant from the Rule, by the which I mu&s;t be either acquitted or condemned; and &s;o exact will that &s;crutiny be, that not &s;o much as one idle word &s;hall e&s;cape it, <HI>Math</HI> 12.36. <HI>Every idle word that men &s;hall &s;peak, they &s;hall give an account thereof in the day of Judgment.</HI> I am under the watchful eye of an all-&s;eeing God, who keeps an exact account of all my thoughts, words and deeds, and will certainly in that day, bring them into open light, and &s;et them in or|der before me; <HI>For God will bring every work in|to Judgment with every &s;ecret thing,</HI> Eccl. 12.14.

whether I will or no; and it will be utterly in vain for me to tire the <HI>Rocks and Mountains, to hide me from the pre&s;ence of the great God,</HI> or &s;ecure me from making my appearance before his Judg|ment &s;eat. There will need no witne&s;s then to be produced to prove any of the matters that &s;hall be alledged again&s;t me; &s;ince mine own Con&s;cience is an exact regi&s;ter of all things, and will be more than a thou&s;and witne&s;&s;es.

I have a righteous Judge unto whom I mu&s;t give up my accounts, with whom there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons, and a vain thing it is to hope to bribe him; but according as my true &s;tate, upon the mo&s;t exact enquiry, &s;hall be found, &s;o will he take order about me, and pa&s;s the &s;entence either of ab&s;olution or con|demnation upon me. Now, what a check would &s;uch reflections as the&s;e are, throughly believed, and fixedly entertained, give to the mad young|&s;ter, in the mid&s;t of all his frolicks, and mar all the mirth of his greedy lu&s;ts, turning it into bit|terne&s;s? God therefore offers &s;uch a memento as this is to the&s;e. Eccl. 11.9. <HI>Rejoyce, O young man, in thy youth, and let thine heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the &s;ight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all the&s;e things, God will bring thee into Judgment.</HI>

But as for all others, how can they, at &s;uch an hour, look upon it without horror? Truly, the uncertainty of death, and the certainty of the following Judgment, and Reck|oning he mu&s;t then be called to, is enough con|&s;tantly to fill the &s;inner with con&s;ternation, for that he hath rea&s;on every moment to be afraid of the arre&s;t: though carele&s;s men, put away the
