<HEAD>A few words to the <HI>Reader,</HI> by way of PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>MY intent is to say little, either of the Book it self, or by what impulse I took the pains to compile and publish it, but rather let nimble Time, that over-runs all things, manifest the Effects of both&punc; even so also let it manifest my Opponents, which hath been the fate of publick Writers heretofore.</P>
<P>And lest that in this promiscuous Generation of men, this little Book might appear as a promiscuous Composition of Authors&punc; it is therefore distinguished in two parts.</P>
<P>Now then as to the first part I say, that most of what the diligent Searcher and Enquirer shall find dispersed in the whole Works or Writings of <HI>Jacob Behme,</HI> he will here find collected, contracted and comprised in a little room, it being chiefly the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sub|stantial or affirmative part that is here delivered, and not the circumstantial; for otherwise it could not be contained in so few Sheets. For <HI>Jacob</HI> throughout his Writings hath much used Tautology as himself confesseth, by reason (as he saith) of his slow and dull Apprehension.</P>
<P>And yet what is here immitted to thy view is his own words and sentences, in his own phrase and sense, as I found them dispersed as aforesaid; for
<PB REF="000447_0003_0FA5AE79470397E0">
no otherwise durst I deal by him; God forbid I should: only this know, that I have in about half a dozen places added a Parenthesis instead of Mar|gent, which yet is his own expressions of the same thing else-where, thereby the more unfolding the matter to the understanding. All which [consi|dering my many years acquaintance with his Wri|tings] may very well be, notwithstanding the won|derful Revelation and deep sight and knowledge this man had in heavenly Mysteries; for in his time the eternal day was but, as it were, dawning, and the day-star beginning to appear; but now the glorious Sun is arisen and arising, and shines forth in its splendor, and gives a clearer discerning of things that differ.</P>
<P>Not that I boast my self so greatly illuminated thereby, or so highly graduated in discerning more than others: O no, I am as subject to be obscured by the clouds of Sin and Error as other men, and am so frail and subject to fall, that no man needs the hand of divine Protection more than I; and never had more need than now to call to mind and retain a lively sence of the day of my first inward Visita|tion, which I once knew, which was a Day of Anguish and Sorrow, and that from no external cause, when I sought secret places to bewale my woful state, because of inward Sin (for no man could outwardly accuse me of evil) and yet that day, even that day of Mourning was a day of Love and Re|joycing, in which I can in Truth say,</P>
<L><PB REF="000447_0004_0FA5AE7A0D016FF0">
As Showers of Rain do cause the Earths Increase,</L>
<L>So streams of Tears did bring my Soul true Peace.</L>
<P>And in that day of my first love and zeal for Holiness, the reading all Books was a burthen to me, yea, even the holy Scriptures also, and instead of receiving comfort therefrom, I was only wound|ed in spirit by them, witnessing that saying, <HI>The Letter kills, but it is the Spirit that quickens.</HI> But now I shall come to the matters themselves.</P>

<PB REF="000447_0005_0FA5AE7ADC158B70">
<HEAD><HI>Jacob Behme</HI> to the Doctors and Schollars, and Readers of his Writings</HEAD>
<P>COme on ye Doctors, if ye are in the right, then give answer to the Spirit; What do you think stood in the place of this world before the time of the World? 2<HI>ly,</HI> Out of what do you think the Earth and Stars came to be? 3<HI>dly,</HI> What is that in man that dis|pleaseth God so much, that he tormenteth and afflicteth man so, being he hath created him? And 4<HI>thly,</HI> That he imputeth Sin to man, and condemneth him to eternal punish|ment? 5<HI>thly,</HI> Why hath he created that wherein or wherewith Man committeth sin? 6<HI>thly,</HI> What is the cause or the beginning, or the birth and geniture of Gods fierce Wrath, out of or from which Hell and the Devil are come to be? 7<HI>thly,</HI> Or how comes it that all Creatures in this world do bite, scratch, strike beat and worry one another, and yet sin is imputed only to man? 8<HI>thly,</HI> Out of what are the venomous and poysonous Beasts, and Worms and all manner of Vermine come to be? 9<HI>thly,</HI> Out of what are the holy Angels come to be? 10<HI>thly,</HI> What is the Soul of man? And <HI>lastly,</HI> What is the great GOD himself, and how is he in Love and Wrath?</P>
<P><PB REF="000447_0006_0FA5AE7BA556E238">If you can demonstrate that God is not in the Stars, Elements, Earth, Men, Beasts, Worms, Leaves and Grass, also in Heaven and Earth; also, that all this is not God himself, &amp; that my Spirit is false and wicked, then I will be the first that will burn my Book in the fire, and recall and recant all whatsoever I have written, and will accurse it, and in all obedi|ence willingly submit my self to be instructed by you.</P>
<P>I do not say, that I cannot err at all; for there are some things which are not sufficient|ly declared, and are described, as it were, from a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">impse of the great God, when the Wheel of Nature whirled about too swiftly, so that man with his half dead and dull capacity or apprehension cannot sufficiently compre|hend it.</P>
<P>Now it concerns every one that will speak or teach of divine Mysteries, that he have the Spirit of God, and know in the Light of God those matters which he will give forth for true, and not suck or draw them from his own reason, and so without divine knowledge run upon the bare Letter in his opinion, and drag the Scriptures (as it were) by the hair of the head, to prove it, as is usually done by reason.</P>
<P>From this, so exceeding many Errors are arisen, in that the divine knowledge hath been
<PB REF="000447_0007_0FA5AE80B9C16680">
sought in mens own wit and art, and so men are drawn from the Truth of God in their own Reason.</P>
<P>And though I search sublimely and deep, and shall set it down very clearly, yet this must be said to the <HI>Reader,</HI> that without the Spirit of God it will be a Mystery to him and hidden from him: Therefore let every one take heed how he judgeth, that he fall not into the judgment of God.</P>
<P>Every one will not understand my Writings according to my meaning and sense, but every one according to his gift for his benefit, one more than another, according as the Spirit hath its property in him.</P>
<P>For the spirit of God is often subject to the spirits of men, if they will that which is good or well, and seeth or looketh after what man willeth, that his good work be not hindred, but that every where above all, Gods will or willing, or desiring be done.</P>

<HEAD>Of the two Qualities in one.</HEAD>
<P>TVvo Qualities, a good one, and an evil one, are in one another, as one thing in this World, in all powers in the Stars and the Elements, as also in all the Creatures; and no Creature in the Flesh in the natural Life can subsist, unless it hath the two Quali|ties <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The understanding of the thing here called Quality, is the Foundation of the whole Revelation of</HI> Jacob Behme's, <HI>and all Mystries of which his Wri|tings are only a descrip|tion; for all along the seven Qualities are called sometimes</HI> 7 <HI>Sources,</HI> 7 <HI>Species, Powers, Operations or Faculties of a thing; also the qualifying or fountain Spirits, which give&punc; Model, Image or Frame, the Power, Virtue, Figure, Constitution, Sub|stance, Essence and distinct Beeing of all things that ever were or can be, in&punc; from, and to all Eternity in God, and all Creatures in Heaven, Hell, or in this World. Also the Forms or Properties of Nature, which is the sol|liter or power of God. And so they are the seven Spirits of God&punc; as in the</HI> Revelations <HI>of</HI> John <HI>c.</HI> 1.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. For from the two fold Source every thing hath its great <HI>mobility</HI> running, spring|ing, driving and growing; for meekness in Nature is a still Rest, but the fierceness in every Power maketh all things moveable, running and generative; for the driving Qualities cause a Lust in all Creatures to evil and good.</P>
<P N="3">3. In every Creature in this World is a good and evil Will and Source, which is caused by [or proceedeth from the Stars; for as the Creatures in the Earth are in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r Qualities&punc; so are the Stars; there is nothing in Na|ture wherein there is not good and evil in Men, Beasts, Fowls, Fishes&punc;, Worms, and in all that which is upon the Earth, or in the Earth, or Gold&punc; Silver, Copper, Tinn&punc; Lead, Iron, VVood&punc; Herbs and Grass in the Earth&punc; in Stones, in the VVater, and all whatsoever can be thought upon: Every
<PB N="2" REF="000447_0009_0FA5AE83DF112000">
thing moveth and liveth in this double impulse working or operation, be it what it will.</P>
<P N="4">4. But the holy Angels, and fierce wrathful Devils, are here to be excepted; the holy Angels live and qua|lifie in the Light and Meekness in the good Quality, but the Devils live and reign in the fierce wrathful Quality in fierceness, destruction and perdition.</P>
<P N="5">5. And though <HI>Moses</HI> writes, <HI>I am an angry zealous God</HI>; Yet the meaning of it is not that God is angry in himself, and that there ariseth a Fire of Anger in the holy Trinity: No, that cannot be, for it is written <HI>Against those that hate me:</HI> In that same Creature the Fire of Anger riseth up.</P>
<P>For if God should be angry in himself, then the whole Nature would be on fire, which will come once to pass in the last day in Nature&punc; and not in God. But in God the triumphing Joy will burn; it was never otherwise from Eternity, nor will it ever be otherwise.</P>
<P N="6">6. Now the elevating&punc; springing&punc; triumphing Joy in God, maketh Heaven triumphing and moveable, and Heaven maketh the Stars and Elements moveable, and the Stars and the Elements make the Creatures move|able; out of the Powers of God are the Heavens pro|ceeded, out of the Heavens are the Stars, out of the Stars are the Elements, out of the Elements are the Earth, and the Creatures come to be.</P>
<P>Thus all had its beginning, even to the Angels and Devils, which before the Creation of Heaven, Stars and the Earth, were proceeded out of the same Power, out of which the Heaven, the Stars, &amp; the Earth were proceeded.</P>
<P>Now Hell and the dark World, or the anger of God, is a Gulf of desperation, devoid of the Hope of God&punc; and all good, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t is the first ground to the eternal Nature, the place is between the Kingdom of God and this World, and maketh a peculiar Principal dwelling in it self, and hath neither place nor local abode, and is every where inhabiting it self only, and yet it giveth
<PB N="3" REF="000447_0010_0FA5AE8572920B80">
Essence to the Light and outward VVorld; that is, it is the cause of the Source, <HI>viz.</HI> the Fire, and is the whole Beeing of all God's Beeings.</P>
<P N="7">7. In the Darkness he is an angry zealous God, in the fire Spirit a consuming Fire, and in the Light he is a merciful loving God, and in the Power of the Light he is, especially above all other Properties called God, and yet 'tis all but God manifested, who manifesteth himself through the eternal Nature in ingredient Properties.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Essence of this Vvorld consisteth in evil and good, and the one cannot be without the other. But this is the great Iniquity of this Vvorld, that the evil-over-powereth the good, that the Anger is stronger then the Love, and this by reason of the Sin of the Devils and Men, who have disturbed Nature by the false Desire, that it mightily and effectually worketh in the wrath as a Poyson in the Body.</P>
<P N="9">9. VVe see very clearly, that there is nothing in this Vvorld so evil, but it hath a good in it; the good hath its rise originally out of the heavenly Property, or light Vvorld, and the evil hath its Property out of the dark Vvorld, for both VVorlds are in each other as one.</P>

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> Form Bitter, Compunctive.</HEAD>
<P>The motion of the Desire, it cutteth asunder the hardness and attracted Desire, the true Root of Life, a cause of the stirring, so also of the Senses, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ground of the bitter pain.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>III.</HI> Form Anguish, Perceivance.</HEAD>
<P>It is a cause of the Mind, wherein the Senses are moved and acted, the ground of the natural VVill, wherein the eternal VVill desireth to be manifested, that is&punc; it will be a Fire or Light; In these three first Properties consisteth the foundation of Anger, and of Hell, and of all that is wrathful.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>IV.</HI> Fire, Spirit, Reason, Desire.</HEAD>
<P>In the Fire the unity appeareth, and is seen in the Light, that is in a burning love; and the wrath in the Essence of Fire. In Fire and Light consisteth the Life of all things [<HI>viz.</HI> in the Will thereof] let them be insensible, vegetable or rational things, every thing as the Fire hath its ground, either from the Eternal, as the Soul, or from the Temporary, as Astral Elemen|tary things; for the Eternal is one Fire, and the Tem|porary is another.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>V.</HI> Form, Light, Love.</HEAD>
<P>This Property is the Fire of Love, or world of Pow|er and Light, which in the Darkness dwelleth in it self, and the Darkness comprehendeth it not; in the Light the eternal Unity is substantial, that is&punc; an holy spiritual Fire, an holy Light, an holy Air, which is nothng else but Spirit, also an holy Water, which is the over-flow|ing Love of the unity of God, and an holy Earth, which is all powerful virtue and working: It is the true spi|ritual; angelical world of the divine Joy, which is hid|den in this visible world.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="5" REF="000447_0012_0FA5AE86E2301B10">
<HEAD><HI>VI.</HI> Form, Sound, Voice, Word.</HEAD>
<P>Proceeding from the divine Powers, which is formed in the Love; the Sound is the understanding, wherein all the Properties understand one another.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>VII.</HI> Form, Essence, Beeing, Mansion.</HEAD>
<P>This seventh Property is rightly and truly called the ground or place of Nature, wherein the other Properties stand in one only ground, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the other six, in which they work as the Life doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Flesh, also it is a Food of the Fire, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Fire draweth Essence for its sustenance, wherein it burneth, and the seventh is the Kingdom of the divine Glory. Not that the seventh Property is the Tincture, but it is the Body of it; the Power and Virtue of the Fire and Light is the Tincture in the substantial Body.</P>
<P>It is especially to be noted, that alwayes the first and seventh Properties are accounted for one, and the second and sixth, also the third and fifth, and the fourth is only the dividing, mark or bound. And yet all se|ven are but one; the last is the Body of the first; They are altogether only the manifestation of God, accor|ding to Love and Anger, Eternity and Time.</P>
<P>In the Desire is the original of Darkness, and in the Fire the eternal Unity is made manifest with the Light in the fiery Nature. Out of the fiery Property, and the property of the Light, the Angels and Souls have their Original.</P>
<P>The Darkness becometh substantial in it self, and the Light becometh also substantial in the fiery Desires; these two make two Principles, <HI>viz.</HI> God's anger in the dark|ness, and God's love in the Light, each of them worketh in it self, and there is only such a difference between them, as between Day and Night, and yet both of them have but one only ground, and the one is alwayes a cause of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000447_0013_0FA5AE87A67BE208">The visible World is the third Principle, that is, the third ground and beginning, this is out-breathed out of the inward ground, <HI>viz.</HI> out of both the first Prin|ciples, and brought into the Nature and Form of a Creature.</P>
<P>But according to the manifestation of the Trinity of God, there are but three Properties of Nature, the first is the Desire, which belongeth to God the Father, yet it is only a Spirit; but in the seventh Property the Desire is substantial.</P>
<P>The second is the divine Power and Virtue, and be|longeth to God the Son; in the second Property it is only a Spirit, but in the sixth it is the substantial Power and Virtue.</P>
<P>The third belongeth to the holy Ghost, and in the beginning of the third Property&punc; it is only a fiery Spirit&punc; but in the fifth Property the great Love is manifested therein.</P>
<P>Now these are the seven Properties in one only ground, and all seven are equally Eternal, without be|ginning; none of them can be accounted the first, second third or last, but are equally Eternal.</P>
<P>We must represent this in a Typical way, that it may be understood, how the one is born of the other.</P>

<HEAD>Of God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost.</HEAD>
<P>WHen we consider the whole Nature, and its Property, then we see the Father. When we behold Heaven and the Stars, then we behold his eternal Power and Wisdom. So many Stars as stand in the whole Heaven, which are in|comprehensible to Reason; so manifold and various is the Power and VVisdom of God the Father.</P>
<P>If a man would liken the Father to any thing, he should liken him to the round Globe of Heaven. Thou must not conceive here that the very Power, which is in the Father&punc; stand|eth in a peculiar severed part or place in the Father, as the Stars do in Heaven. No, but the Spirit sheweth that all the Powers in the Father are one in another as one Power.</P>
<P>VVhen I think with my self what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> many hundred thou|sand Miles above the stary Firmament, I find the eternal, unchangeable Vnity is there, the only Eternal God, or that

But the Angels live in the Power of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Father very meekly, and full of Joy, and they alwayes sing in the Power of the Father.</P>
<P>In the Fire God is called an angry God; but in the Light or Love-fire, he is called the holy God; and in the dark Na|ture he is not called God. VVe must make distinction, each world hath its Principle and Dominion: and indeed all is from one eternal Original; but it severizeth it self in a two-fold Source; a Similitude whereof we have in the Fire and Light, where the Fire is painful and consuming, and the Light, meek and giving: And yet one were as nothing with|out the other.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of God the Son.</HEAD>
<P>YOu must not think that the Son is another God then the Father, or that he is without or besides the Father. No, the Father and Son are not of such a Substance; he is eternally in the Father, he is the Heart in the Father, and the Father generateth him continually from Eternity to Eter|nity, and the Father and Son is one God, of an equal Beeing in Power and Omnipotence.</P>
<P>Now the Heaven and Stars, and the whole Deep between the Stars signifie the Father&mdash; And the seven Planets signifie the seven Spirits of God, or the Princes of the Angels, among which Lord <HI>Lucifer</HI> was one before his fall; which all were made out of the Father in the beginning of the Creation of Angels, before the time of this VVo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld.</P>
<P>Now as the Sun standeth in the midst betwixt the Stars, and the Earth, enlightning all Powers, and is the Light and Heart of all Powers, and is all the Joy in this VVorld&mdash; Even so the Son of God in the Father, is the Heart in the Father, and shineth in all the Powers of the Father, his Power is the moving springing Joy in all the Powers of the Father, and shineth in the whole Father as the Sun doth in the whole VVorld.</P>

<HEAD>Of God the Holy Ghost.</HEAD>
<P>THe holy Ghost proceedeth from the Father and the Son, and is the third self-subsisting Person in the Deity: As the Elements in this World go forth from the Sun and Stars, and are the moving Spirit, which is in every thing in this world: So the Holy Ghost is the moving Spirit in the whole Father, and goeth forth from Eternity to Eternity continu|ally from the Father and Son, and replenisheth the whole Father; he is nothing less or greater then the Father and Son.</P>
<P>Here we cannot say with any ground, that God is three Persons; but he is three fold in his eternal Generation, he begetteth himself in Trinity, having three manner of work|ings, and yet but one only Essence, as may be seen in the over-flown Power and Virtue in all things, but it is especially represented to us in Fire, Light and Air, which are three several sorts of workings, and yet but in one ground and substance.</P>
<P>And as we see that Fire, Light and Air arise from a Candle [though the Candle be none of the three, but a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ause of them] so likewise the eternal Vnity is the cause and ground of the eternal Trinity, which manifesteth it self from the Vnity, and bringeth forth it self in (first) Desire or Will, which is the Father; secondly, Pleasure or Delight, which is the Son; and thirdly, proceeding or out-going, which is the Holy Ghost.</P>

<P><HI>Thou must not understand this in an earthly manner, for an Angel hath no Guts, neither Flesh nor Bones, but is constituted and composed by the divine Power, in the shape, form and manner of a man, and hath all Mem|bers like man, except the Members of Generation and the Fundament, or go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng out of the Dross; neither hath an Angel need of these.

<P><HI>But the heavenly Fruits which he eateth are not Earthly; and though they are of such a form and shape as the Earthly are, yet they are meer divine Power.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indeed it is most certain and true, that there are all manner of Fruits, Plants and Flowers in Heaven, as in this World, and not meerly Types and Shadows: As the Angels are, so are the Vigitation and Fruits, all from the divine Power.</HI></P>

<P>First, Prince <HI>Michael,</HI> signifieth the great Strength and Power of God, and is created according to God the Father, that circumference, or space Region, or Pro|vince, wherein he and his Angels are created, is his Kingdom which is above the created Heaven.</P>
<P>Secondly, Prince <HI>Lucifer</HI> this high and mighty glori|ous beautious King lost his right Name in the fall&punc; He was created according to the quality, beauty and condition of God the Son, and was bound to and united with him in Love, and his Heart also stood in the centre of Light, as if he had been God himself, and his Beauty and Brightness well transcended all For his circumference Conception or chiefest Mother was the Son of God&mdash;his Court, Province, Place or Region wherein he dwelt with his whole Army or Company, and wherein he is become a Creature, and which was his Kingdom, is the created Heaven, and this World wherein we dwell with our King Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>For our King sitteth in divine Omnipotence, where King <HI>Lucifer</HI> did sit, and on the kingly Throne of ex|pulsed <HI>Lucifer,</HI> and the Kingdom of King <HI>Lucifer</HI> is now become his. O Prince <HI>Lucifer!</HI> how dost thou relish that?</P>
<P><HI>Lucifer</HI> had still been an Angel, if his own Will had not introduced him into the Fires Might, desiring to domineer in the strong fiery Might.</P>
<P>Thirdly&punc; <HI>VRIE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> is a gracious aimable blessed Prince and King, he hath his Name from the flash, or going forth of the Light, which signifieth rightly God the holy Ghost.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="000447_0020_0FA5AE91DE2B1948">For as the Holy Ghost goeth forth from the Light, and formeth, figureth, and imageth all, and reigneth in all; such also is the power and gracious aimable blessedness of a Cherubim, who is the King and Heart of all his Angels, that is, when his Angels do but be|hold him, they are all then affected and touched with the Will of their King.</P>
<P>These three Kingdoms together contain such a deep, as is not of any human number, nor can be measured by any thing; yet you must know, that these three Kingdoms have a beginning and end; but that God that hath made these three Kingdoms out of himself, is infinite and hath no end.</P>
<P>And the three Kingdoms are circular, round about the Son of God, neither of them is further or nearer to the Son of God, for the one is equally as near about the Son of God as the other.</P>
<P>From this Fountain, and from all the Powers of the Father goeth forth the Holy Ghost, together with the Light and Power of the Son of God, in and through all Angelical Kingdoms or Dominions, and without, beyond, and besides all the Angelical Kingdoms, which no Angel or man is able to search or dive into.</P>
<P>Neither have I any purpose to consider of it further, much less to write; but my Revelation reacheth even into the three Kingdoms, like an Angelical Knowledge.</P>
<P>Here you must know, that the <HI>Angels</HI> are not all of one Quality, neither are they equal or alike one to another in Power and Might: Indeed every Angel hath the Power of all the seven qualifying or fountain, Spirits.

<P>VVe are not to understand, that the holy Angels dwell only above the Stars without the place of this VVorld: Indeed they dwell without the Dominion and Source of this world, but in the place of this world; albeit there is no place in Eternity, the place of this world, and also the place without this world is all one to them.</P>
<P>VVe men see not Angels and Devils with our Eyes, and yet they are about us, and among us, the reason is because they dwell not in the Source and Dominion of our world.</P>
<P>VVe understand that evil and good Angels dwell near to one another, and yet there is the greatest immense distance [between them] for the Heaven is in Hell, and the Hell is in Heaven, and yet the one is not manifest to the other; and although the Devil should go many Millions of Miles, desiring to enter into Heaven, and to see it, yet he would be still in Hell, and not see it; also the Angels see not the Darkness, for their sight is meer Light of divine Power; and the Devils sight is meer Darkness of God's Anger: The like also is to be understood of the Saints, and again of the VVicked.</P>

<P>The Sun hath its own Royal Place to it self, and doth not go away from that place where it came to be at first; as some supp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se, that it runneth round about the Globe of the Earth in a Day and a Night, and some of the Astrologers also write so: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere I shall have Adversaries enough that will be ready to censure me, and say&punc; Astrologers understand it better, who have writ of such matters; and they will look upon this great opening as a Cow locks upon a new Barn-door.</P>
<P>But that I write otherwise then Astrologers in some things, I do it not out of supposition, doubting whether it be so or no: I dare make no doubt herein, neither can any man instruct me herein: I have not my Knowledge by study.</P>
<P>Now this Opinion or Supposition is not right, but the Earth roveth [or turneth] it self about, and runeth with the other Planets as in a Wheel round about the Sun: The Earth doth not remain staying in one place, but runeth round in a Year once about the Sun, as the other Planets [viz. <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI>] that are next the Sun; but <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Jupiter&punc;</HI> as also <HI>Mars,</HI> by reason of their great Orb cir|cumference, cannot do it, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> stand so high above, and far distant from the Sun.</P>
<P>The other Planets are peculiar Bodies of their own, which have a Corporeal Propriety of themselves, and are not bound to any fixed place, but only to their Circles, Orb or Sphere, wherein they run their Course; but the Sun is not such a Body, but is only a place or Locality kindled by the Light of God.</P>
<P>Vnderstand&punc; the place where the Sun is, is such a place as you may chuse or suppose any where above the Earth, And if God should kindle the Light by the Heat, then the whole World would be such a meer Sun, for the same Power where the Sun standeth is every where all over, and before the time of Wrath it was every where all over the place of this World, as light as the Sun is now, but not so intolerable.</P>

<P>The Stars are arisen or proceeded out of the kindled House of God's wrath, for the whole House is benumed in Death as the Earth is, whence the Stars also subsist in Wrath and Love.</P>
<P>Before the times of the created Heavens, the Stars and Elements, and before the creation of Angels, there was no such Wrath of God, no Death, no Devil, no Earth nor Stones, neither any Stars, but the Deity generated it self very meekly and lovingly, and formed, figured, and framed it self in Ideas, Shapes and Images, which were incorporated according to the qualifying or fountain Spirits in the ge|nerating.</P>

<P><HI>Moses</HI> saith, God created Heaven and Earth, and all Creatures in six days, and rested on the seventh; yet God needed no Rest&punc; for he hath wrought from Eternity, and he is a meer working Power and Virtue; the understanding lieth hidden in those Words; could not he have made all his Works in one day? Neither can we properly say, there was any Day before the Sun was; for in the Deep there is but one day [in all.]</P>

Vegetation is its right Life: the inward Light, and Power of the Light, giveth in man the right divine un|derstanding: But there is no right divine apprehension in the Syderial Spirit: The Syderial Body dwelleth in the Elemental, as the light world in the darkness, it is the true rational Life of all Creatures.</P>

<HEAD>Of the first Man <HI>Adam,</HI> before, and after the Fall.</HEAD>
<P>ALl things of this world have a two-fold Body, <HI>viz.</HI> an Elemental, from the Fire, Air, Water and Earth, and a spiritual Body from the <HI>Astrum</HI>; and like|wise a two-fold Spirit, the one Astral, the other Elemental.</P>
<P>Man only among all the earthly Creatures hath a three-fold Body and Spirit; for he hath also the inter|nal spiritual World in him, which is likewise two-fold&punc; <HI>viz&middot;</HI> Light and Darkness, and also corporeally and spi|ritually this Spirit is the Soul, but this Body is from the VVater of the holy Element, which dyed in <HI>Adam,</HI> that is, disappeared as to his Life.</P>
<P>Now when God created the Earth, he founded its time when he would keep the Judgment, and sever the evil from the good, and give the evil for an Habitation to the apostate Prince; but being the good in the Occluse Earth was without heavenly Creatures [see|ing its Prince was cast out] God created <HI>Adam</HI> another Hirarch out of this good Ens, to be a ruler of this place, and hence came the Devil's envy against man, and all good Creatures of this world.</P>
<P>The first Free-will which was breathed into <HI>Adam</HI>&punc; was good; indeed it was both from God's love and anger, <HI>viz.</HI> from the centre of the eternal pregnatress
<PB N="24" REF="000447_0031_0FA5AE9E1B9E5000">
of the eternal spiritual Nature; but it had the under|standing in it to rule and govern it self, so as it might stand and subsist eternally.</P>
<P>But the crafty distemper or infection, introduced by the Devil, was in the Ens of the Earth, whence [or whereof] <HI>Adam</HI>'s outward Body was framed: Into this earthly Ens the Devil brought his desire by the Serpents crafty Ens. So that the <HI>Lubet</HI> arose in the Ens of the Body, whereinto the first free-will of the inspired Soul entred, and assumed the <HI>Lubet</HI> of the Body, and intro|duced this Lubet into a Desire or Substance.</P>
<P>And out of this Substance another self-ful VVill did now arise, <HI>viz.</HI> a Bastard, a false Serpent-Child; and this Bastard <HI>Adam</HI> did originally propagate to his <HI>Eve,</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> to her Son <HI>Cain,</HI> and so one man to another; thus we have now in this earthly Flesh this same false will, proceeded from the Serpent's substance, where|unto the Devil introduceth his Desire, and tempteth us, and continually maketh us lust and long after the devilish Property, <HI>viz.</HI> Pride, Covetousness, Envy and Anger.</P>
<P><HI>Thus the Devil rideth in and upon Body and Soul [of man] but now the first introduced Free-will which, God breathed into</HI> Adam, <HI>lieth yet in all men. For it is the true real Soul, the centre of the Fire and Light, a spark of the divine Power and Omnipotence, but wholly hemed in, and captivated in this wicked introduced Bastard.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For Prince</HI> Lucifer <HI>by his false Imagination had tainted the Limus of the Earth before the Compaction [or Creation] it was the place of his Hirarchies; now the outward Body of man was taken out of the Limus of the Earth, in the</HI> Verbum Fiat, <HI>and formed according to the property of the human Life, which was in the Word.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thus</HI> Adam's <HI>Flesh was half Earthly, and half heaven|ly, whence he lusted against the Command and VVill of God; this is, as</HI> Paul <HI>saith.</HI> The Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh&mdash;Adam's <HI>Spirit also

by the Imagination hath brought a Power into the Earth, and so the Matrix of Nature gave him what he would have.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He must be tempted to try whether he would stand an Angel instead of</HI> Lucifer; <HI>and therefore God created him not barely an Angel, so that if he should fall, and not stand, he might help him&punc; So that he might not perish in the fierce Wrath, as</HI> Lucifer <HI>did, therefore he was created out of Matter, and his Spirit introduced into the Matter,</HI> viz. <HI>into a Sulpher of Water and Fire, that God might again exgenerate a new Life unto him, as a fair pleasant smelling Blossom springing out of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For God saw very well, according to the property of his Wrath, that man would fall, but he would bring him again through, and in the Name</HI> Jesus, <HI>through the corruptible Death into the royal Kingdom, whence</HI> Lueifer <HI>was fallen, in whose stead the man Christ, God and Man in one person, should sit as Hirarch, High-Priest, or the great Prince of men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Poor man did not fall out of a resolved purposed Will, but through the poysonous venomous Infection of the Devil, else there had been no remedy for him. Neither hath man brought the Malignity and Venom into the</HI> Birds, Beasts, Worms, Stones, Vegetables, <HI>and all Creatures&punc; but</HI> Lucifer <HI>hath made the house of Love to be a house of eternal Enmity, the house of Light to be a house of Darkness,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>otherwise, if man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had brought Malignity and Wrath into all Creatures, then he could never have looked for Mer|cy at God's hands, no more then the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>Adam <HI>did not desire to prove the first Principle, as</HI> Lucifer <HI>had done, but his lust was only bent to taste, to prove Evil and Good,</HI> viz. <HI>the vanity of the Earth, the outward Soul was awakened, so that the hunger entred into its Mother, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it was drawn, and introduced into another Source.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And when this Hunger entred to eat of Evil and Good, then the desire in the</HI> Fiat <HI>drew forth the Tree of Tempta|tion, and set it before</HI> Adam, <HI>then came the severe Command from God</HI>&mdash;Thou shalt not eat of the Tree of the Know|ledges
<PB REF="000447_0033_0FA5AE9FC53EAAA8">
of Good and Evil, in that day thou eatest there|of thou shalt dye the Death.</P>
<P><HI>But that</HI> Moses <HI>saith,</HI> The Tree of Life stood in the midst of the Garden; <HI>and presently next after setteth down,</HI> and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil: <HI>Her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lieth the Vail before</HI> Moses <HI>his Eyes, and the earthly sinful man cannot behold him.

<P>Adam <HI>was a man&punc; and also a Woman, and yet none of them [distinct] but a Virgin full of Chastity, Modesty and Purity,</HI> viz. <HI>the Image of God he had, both the Tinctures of the Fire and Light in him, in the Conjunction of which the one Love,</HI> viz. <HI>the Virginal centre stood, be|ing the fair Paradisical Rose-Garden of delight, wherein he loved himself; as we also in the Resurrection of the Dead shall be such as Christ telleth us&punc; That we shall be like the Angels of God&punc; yet not only pure Spirit, as the An|gels, but in heavenly Bodies, in which the spiritual angelical Body inhabiteth, even such a man as</HI> Adam <HI>was before his</HI> Eve <HI>shall arise again, and eternally possess Paradise, not a man or woman, but as the Scripture saith, they are Virgins.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Every Creature in its arival to this world, bringeth its cloa|thing from its Dam, but man cometh miserable, naked, shiftless in deepest Poverty and Vnability, and cannot help himself, which doth sufficiently show unto us, that he was not created of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto this Misery, but in his Perfection, as all other Crea|tures were, which Perfection the first man fooled away [or lost] by false Lust.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now</HI> Adam [<HI>if he had stood] should have generated or brought forth after a Magical manner, which had been thus [effected] not by a sundry peculiar issue from</HI> Adam's <HI>body as now. But as the Sun thorow-shineth the Water, and reads it not, even so to the spiritual Body,</HI> viz. <HI>the Birth had been brought forth, and in its coming forth had been sub|stantial without Pains, Care and Distress in a great joy|fulness and delight.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Which after when</HI> Venus<HI>'s Matrix was taken from</HI> Adam, <HI>and formed into a Woman, must be done through sorrow, pangs and distress, as God said to</HI> Eve, Thou shalt now bring forth Children in Sorrow, and thy Will shall be subject to thy Husband. <HI>Wherefore? because it was sprung forth from the mans Will.</HI> Eve <HI>was half the</HI> Adam, viz. <HI>the part wherein</HI> Adam <HI>should have loved and impreg|nated himself&punc; the same, when as he stood not, was taken from him in his Sleep, and formed into a Woman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But that the fall might not proceed [or come] from the divine appointment, God made man perfect, and created and ordained him unto Paradise, and forbad him the false Lust, which the Devil stirred up through the Limus of the Earth in</HI> Adam's <HI>outward Body, with his false Imgination and hun|gry desire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And</HI> Adam <HI>was forty days in Paradise [before his</HI> Eve

<P>But the breaking [or dividing] of <HI>Adam,</HI> when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> woman was taken out of him, is the breaking or bru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">sing of Christ&punc;s Body on the Cross, from the sixth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> unto the ninth, for so long was the <HI>Fiat</HI> in <HI>Adam</HI>&punc; Sleep, in the seperating of the Man and VVoman, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in such a space of time the VVoman was compleatl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> finished [or brought forth] out of <HI>Adam</HI> into a Femal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Person [or image] She is not taken only and wholl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> out of <HI>Adam's</HI> Flesh, but out of his Essence, out o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Female part, she is <HI>Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m</HI>'s Matrix.</P>
<P>Now when the pregnant Matrix was taken fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Adam,</HI> the woman was every way formed with suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Members for propagation as she is at this day, and so <HI>Adam</HI> also; for before, when <HI>Adam</HI> was Male and Female, he needed no such Members, for his Birth was Magical, his Conception moving in the Matrix [was to be] done through Imagination.</P>
<P>And the beastial worms Carkess of the Bowels, with the formation of other inward principal Members, per|taining to the earthly Life, was hung upon <HI>Adam</HI> in|stead of the Female Matrix, and the like worms Carkess was also hung upon the VVoman, instead of the heaven|ly Limbus; of which the poor Soul is to this day asha|med, that it must bear a beastial Form on the Body, and propagate as the Beasts do.</P>
<P>Now then <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> standing thus, as man and wife in <HI>Paradise,</HI> and having yet the heavenly Source and Joy, though mixed, the Devil could not endure that&punc; for his Envy was too great: and seeing he had brought down <HI>Adam's</HI> Angelical form, he looked now upon <HI>Eve,</HI> viz. the VVoman out of <HI>Adam,</HI> and per|swaded her to the evil Fruit, and she did eat and gave to <HI>Adam.</HI></P>

the naked Sword came, and stood before the Door&mdash; His Sword was that of the destroying Angel, which now cutteth man with Heat, Cold, Sickness, Necessity and Death, and at last cutteth off the earthly Life from the Soul.</P>
<P>But though the outward Figure was just so, yet it hath far another <HI>A, B, C,</HI> internally; the natural man without God's Light, understands nothing thereof.</P>
<P>This Sword is in man, when man converteth and en|treth into Sorrow for his committed Sins, and casteth away Vanity, and stepeth into the Infants Shirt&mdash;In this Anxious sorrowful Gate of true Repentance the Angel standeth with the Fire-flaming Sword, and the Virgin-Bud forceth quite through this Sword into <HI>Para|dise,</HI> viz. into the Life of Christ, and groweth forth through this Sword.</P>
<P>And now the Virgin-Child standeth with its fair Rose in the new Plant in <HI>Paradise,</HI> and the poor Soul which begetteth this Child, standeth the whole time of this Life under the reach and swing of this Fire-Sword, and is fast bound with a Band to the gross Beast in the out|ward World [<HI>viz.</HI> this worms Carkess] where the Virgin-child is sufficiently thrust at, and wounded with this Fire Sword: For the Fire-Soul, which in the Fire-Sword of God's anger, is bound to the Serpent-Monster, doth daily amuse it self upon the Serpent-Monster, and sinneth, and even then this Fire-Sword doth cut away the Sins, and devours them into God's anger, where they are examined and judged.</P>
<P>Now God hath cursed the Earth for man's sake, so that <HI>Paradise</HI> springeth no more through the Earth, for it is become a Mystery, and yet it is continually there; and into that Mystery the Souls of the Saints depart, when the earthly Body seperateth it self from the Soul.</P>
<P>It is in this world, and yet is out of this world; for this world's Quality or Source toucheth it not: the whole world would have continued to be <HI>Paradise,</HI> if <HI>Adam</HI> had

<P><HI>Adam</HI> said, <HI>I am naked, and afraid</HI>; Of what was he afraid? he felt in himself the world of God's anger, and feared that it would wholly enkindle it self, and devour him, as happened to <HI>Lucifer:</HI> therefore he trem|bled at the Call of the holy Voice, as the Anger trem|bleth at the Love.</P>
<P>Indeed he was naked, but knew it not, till they did eat the earthy Fruit, and then their Eyes were opened, for the heavenly Virgin of God<HI>'s</HI> wisdom departed from them, and then they first felt the Kingdom of the Stars and Elements.</P>
<P>Man had no such beastial Flesh before the Fall, but heavenly Flesh; no <HI>heat,</HI> nor <HI>frost,</HI> no <HI>sickness,</HI> nor <HI>mishape,</HI> or <HI>mischief,</HI> also no <HI>fear</HI> could touch or terrifie him, his Body could go through Earth and Stone un|interrupted by any thing; for that could be no eternal man which earthliness could limit.</P>
<P>The Devil was indeed an Angel, and <HI>Adam</HI> an Image of God, they had both the Fire and the Light, as also divine Wit, Ingenuity or understanding in them: Why did the Devil imagin according to the Fire, and <HI>Adam</HI> according to the Earth?

<P>The inward man was in Heaven, and his Essences were Paradisical&punc; his glance in the inward Eye was Majesty, an incorruptible Body, which could speak the Language of God, and of Angels, and the Language of Nature; as we see in <HI>Adam,</HI> that he could give Names to all Creatures, to every one according to its Essence and Property, he was also in the outward Image, and yet kne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not the outward Image, as inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the Body hath no knowledge.</P>
<P>And in this two fold Body [which was created in the sixth Day, in the sixth Hour of the Day, in the same Hour which Christ was hanged on the Cross] after the Body was finished the royal Soul was breathed in from within by the holy Ghost into the Heart, in the holy man, into its Principle, like an awakening of the Deity.</P>

<P>The Source of the Wrath insinuated it self with the brea|thing in, <HI>viz.</HI> with the original of the Soul, so that the Soul could not remain God's Image, unless it remained in Humi|lity and Obedience, and yielding its Will into God's Will, or else it were very difficult for a Creature to rule such true Principles, as the wrathful and the outward are, the out|ward being also born out of the wrathful.</P>

<P><HI>For</HI> Adam's <HI>Soul having let in the</HI> Turba <HI>of this VVo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld, that if the</HI> Turba <HI>see a strange Child&punc; it riseth up against it instantly, and destroyeth it; it continueth to en|dure only so long as the inward Spirit can subdue and over|power the outward.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And this Form is called</HI> Negromancy, <HI>a Transmutation, where the inward over-powereth the outward, for it is natural, and we understand that when we shall be changed&punc; that change will be made thus by the same</HI> Turba, <HI>which hath the first</HI> Fiat <HI>in it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>if the Spirit were an Angel&punc; the similitude of God, yet the VVill can make it a proud Devil; and also make a Devil an Angel, if it sink it self into Death, into Humi|lity under the Cross, and cast it self into the Spirit of God, and so submit to his Government, then it sinketh into Eter|nity, out of the Source&punc; into the still nothing&punc; which is yet all:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>; The Spirit of the Soul hath power to enter

into another man, into his Marrow and Bones, <HI>viz.</HI> into the Sulpher, and to bring the <HI>Turba</HI> into h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, if he be false; so far as every one is not armed with the Spirit of God, but is found naked in the Spirit of this World, as may be seen by Witches.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI>; It hath such power, if it be the Child of God, that it can lead the <HI>Turba</HI> captive, and can pour it out upon the House of the Wicked, as <HI>Elias</HI> did the Fire, and <HI>Moses</HI> before <HI>Pharaoh</HI>; for it can throw down Mountains and break Rocks.</P>
<P>This you must understand to be so far as that thing is capable of the <HI>Turba,</HI> by awakening the Wrath, then it is possible, but if not, and that the Spirit of God be in a thing, then it cannot be, for it would pour Water upon the <HI>Turba</HI> of the Fire, which would then be as it were dead, and its power would lie in Derision: And therefore Heaven is a middle between God and Hell, <HI>viz.</HI> between Love and Anger, and was created out of the midst of the Waters, so that the Devil cannot rule with his <HI>Turba,</HI> the VVater&punc; turneth his purpose into derision, as the false Magick, and blinded Inchantment are drowned in the VVater.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fifth Power</HI> of the VVill, or Spirit of the Soul, is, that it may or can seek all VVonders that are in Na|ture, <HI>viz.</HI> all Arts, Languages, Buildings, Plantings, Distraction, Knowledge; it can command the Starry Heaven, as <HI>Joshua</HI> did, when he commanded the Sun to stand still, and <HI>Moses</HI> the Sea, that it stood up; also he commanded the Darkness, and it came; it can make an earthly Life, as <HI>Moses</HI> made the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce and Frogs, also Serpents, and other Wonders.</P>
<P>It hath Death in its Power, so that it can over|power that&punc; if it ride in the Charriot of the Bride [<HI>viz.</HI> the VVill of the holy Ghost] it can bridle and overcome the Devil if its [VVill] be in God, there is nothing can be named that it cannot subdue.</P>
<P>The Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> power was so potent before the Vanity,
<PB N="37" REF="000447_0044_0FA5AEB0473926D0">
that it was not subject to any thing; and so it is still powerful, if the understanding were not taken away from it; it can by Magick alter all things whatsoever are in the world's Essence, and introduce them into ano|ther Essence; but the vanity in the outward A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s do|minion hath b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought a Darkness thereinto, so that it doth not know it self; it must in this Life time be its own Enemy, that it may learn to be humble, and con|tinue in the divine Harmony, and not become a Devil.</P>
<P>And so the Devil can do nothing to it, for he is a proud Spirit, and would be above the VVonders of God, but an humility can bind him; after this ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ner every man may escape the false Magitian&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> also the <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omancer</HI>; for no Power can touch him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whom God dwelleth.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, all the three Principles are in the Seed, but the inward cannot be by <HI>known</HI> the outward, for in the Seed the Soul is not living, but when the two Tinctures come together, then it is a whole Essence; for the Soul is essential in the Seed, and in the Conception it becometh Substantial.</P>

<HEAD>Whether is the Soul of a new-born Child without Sin?</HEAD>
<P>HOw can a Soul be born pure, it cannot be, it bringeth the <HI>Turba</HI> with it into the World, and is sinful in the Mother's Womb.</P>
<P>Yet the Soul is not wholly forsaken of God, so far as the Father and Mother are honest, and in God, for it cometh from the Soul of the Father and Mother: And although a Child dye in the Mothers womb without Baptism, yet it is baptized with the Spirit of the Father and of the Mother, <HI>viz.</HI> with the holy Ghost, which dwelleth in them, and the <HI>Turba</HI> is destroyed in Death&punc; for the Faith's part passeth through to God.</P>
<P>But the matter is far otherwise with wicked Parents, if the Child dye in the Mother's Womb, the Soul of it falleth into the <HI>Turba,</HI> and reacheth not God to Eternity, it also knoweth nothing of him, but it is a Life, according to the Essence and Property of the Parents.</P>
<P>And yet it doth not by this reach to the Inflamation, for that Soul it self hath not yet committed Sin, but it is a Spirit in the Source, quite void of Self-desire; it is like burning Brimstone, like the <HI>Ignus Fatui,</HI> and can|not reach God, but remain between Heaven and Hell in the Mystry, until the Judgment of God, which will at last put every thing apart in its own place.</P>
<P>Thus no Soul is born into the World without Sin, be it begotten by holy or unholy Parents; for it is con|ceived in the earthly Seed&punc; and bringeth the <HI>Turba</HI> of the Body with it, which also hath begrit the Soul.</P>
<P>And as the Abiss, and the anger of God, and also the earthly Life depend wholly on God the Father, and yet cannot comprehend and touch his Heart and Spirit; so it is also with the Child in the Mother's womb, if it be begotten by godly Parents, then each Principle standeth in its own part.</P>

<P>Thus there is a difference of places, where Souls are, ac|cording to that wherein the Soul is entred; if it be holy and regenerate, then it hath a Body which expecteth only the won|ders of the Body at the last Day; for at the Day of Judg|ment all Souls good and bad shall every one receive their Sen|tence and Reward.</P>
<P>And you must know, that the Souls of the Wicked have no ease [before the Day of Judgment] their best ease and joy is, when they climb up in the Will in their Works, which they did here, and continually desire to do them more still; it grieveth them that they did not afflict the Honest more then they did; their Will is just so as it was here, they are Spi|rits of Pride like the Devil, a covetous devouring Spirit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; when but the least thought of the last Day entreth them, then fear and horror stirreth in them, they rather l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t that though,

<P>This is a great Wonder, that an Angel should become such a furious Devil: And so the power of God's anger cometh to be manifest in God; for God hath manifested himself ac|cording to both Eyes, in Love and Anger, and it is left free to man, he may go into which of them he will. God throweth none into Wrath, the Soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it self into it.</P>
<P>But you must know that the Wrath hath set its Throat wide open, and draweth mightily, and de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">reth to devour all for it, the Covetousness and the Pride insulting over Humility.</P>
<P>And so also Love and Humili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y have opened their Mouth, and draw with all their Powers&punc; and would draw man into Love, into Heaven: Now into which of these the Soul en|treth, in that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> remaineth, whether in Lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or in Anger; in that Tree it standeth, and there is no deliverence in Eter|nity from thence.</P>

<P>For it is neither in Hell nor in Heaven, but in the Gate in the middle Source of the Principle, where Fire and Light sever themselves, and is held by its <HI>Turba,</HI> that always seeketh the Fire: But then this small Twig which it hath con|ceived, <HI>viz.</HI> the weak Faith deeply demerseth&punc; it self, and earnestly reacheth after the Mercy of God, and yieldeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> self patiently into the death of that, sinking down, and so getteth out from the anguish, and sinketh down from the pain into the meekness of Heaven.</P>

<P>In <HI>Popery</HI> much jugling hath been invented about this, in saying Mass for a Soul, and that for Money only, but this hath been a great Cheat of the <HI>Pope,</HI> of <HI>Babel,</HI> for there is earnestness required to wrestle with the anger of God; and overcome it.</P>
<P>Yet we confess, and acknowledge readily, that the Church of Christ hath great power to ransom such a Soul, if with fervency and earnestness it do it as it was done in the Primi|tive Church, when they had holy People, and holy Priests, who performed their Ministry in real earnestness.</P>

<HEAD>VVhether separated Souls take care of human matters.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst, those Souls which yet have not attained Heaven, and so stick in the Source&punc; in the Principle in the Birth, those have yet the human Essence, with the Works in them, they diligently search out the Cause of their retention.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="000447_0056_0FA5AEC177B421C0">And therefore many of them come again with the Astral Spirit, and wander up and down in their Houses, and places of abode and appear in a human Shape, &amp; desire this and that, and often times take care about their Wills or Testaments, and also think to procure the blessing of the Saints, that they may rest; and if their earthly Affairs do still stick in them, they take care many times also about their Children &amp; Friends.</P>
<P>This condition of theirs continueth so long, till they fall into their Rest, and till their Astral Spirits be consumed, then all such doings, cares and perplexities are at an end, and they also have no more knowledge thereof, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they see them in the wonders in the Magick.</P>
<P>After this sort are once received into G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e, they take no care purposely about human earthly Matters but beholdeth the heavenly Matters&punc; which are brought to it by the Spirit of man, and rejoyceth in them. But there is somewhat still behind, which is this:</P>
<P>A living man hath such power, that his is able with his Spirit to go into Heaven to the separated Souls, and stir them up about some Question by a hearty desire; but it must be earn|est, it must be Faith that must break open a Principle.</P>
<P>And this we see in <HI>Samuel</HI> the Prophet, whom the King of <HI>Israel</HI> raised up, that he might make his Will known to him, though it seem otherwise to some, of whom we may well say, that they are blind, and void of Knowledge, for they speak but their own scholastick Fables, and frame Opinions about that they have no knowledge of in the Spirit. And these are <HI>Babel.</HI></P>

<P>But when the honest Souls which are alive, send them their Works, with their Spirit and Will, they rejoyce in them, and are so affable, that they appear to men angelically in Sleep, and shew them good wayes, and many times reveal Arts, which lie in secret, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Abiss of the Soul.</P>

<P>There are many Villanies in <HI>Negromancy,</HI> which can many times vex and torment the Spirits of men, but it can do so to no Soul that is cloathed with Christ's essentiality, for that Soul is free.</P>
<P>The third sort of seperated Souls, which are in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s bosom in Christ, having the heavenly essentiality, none can stir except they will themselves, as when they have a favour to a Soul that is like themselves; also they take no earthly thing upon them, except it make for the Glory of God, and then they are restless to reveal something in a Magical way.</P>

<HEAD>A short summary Appendix of the Soul, and of the <HI>Turba,</HI> which is the destroyer of the Image; and of <HI>Virgin</HI> Sophia.</HEAD>
<P>THe Soul is an Eye in the eternal <HI>Abiss</HI>&punc; a simili|tude of Eternity, a perfect Figure and Image of the first Principle, and resembleth God the Father in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Person, as to the eternal Nature.</P>
<P>The Essence and Substance of it [meerly and purely as it is in it self] is first the wheel of Nature, as to the first four Forms, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Astringent</HI>; 2. <HI>Bitter</HI>; 3. <HI>Fire</HI>; 4. <HI>Anguish</HI>&mdash;Fire is a similitude of the Soul.</P>
<P>The Soul is an essential Fire, and the flash of Fire is the life of it; it resembleth a Globe, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Eye of Fire: The burning Fire in the Source signifieth the first Prin|ciple and the Life; yet the Fire is not the Life, but the Spirit of the Source which ariseth from the Fire, and goeth forth from the Fire like Air. That is the true Spirit of the Source of the life of the Fire, which con|tinually bloweth the Fire up again, and maketh it burn.</P>
<P>Now the Fire shineth and giveth light out of the Source where it shineth, and the source comprehendeth at the light; and this signifieth the second Principle wherein God dwelleth.</P>
<P>For we know that the Power is in the Light, and not in the Fire, the fire only giveth Essence to the light, and the life or the light produceth meekness and substanti|ality, <HI>viz.</HI> Water.</P>
<P>Now we understand, that there is a meek life in the light without Source, and yet it self is an insensible Source, it is nothing but a longing or desire of Love.</P>
<P>VVhich Source we account a Tincture, in which the budding and blossomings hath its original, yet the fire is the cause of it, and the meekness is a cause of the
<PB N="58" REF="000447_0065_0FA5AEC8CA8B8DF0">
Substantiality; for the desire of Love in the Light, a|tracteth it, and keepeth it, so that it becometh a Sub|stance, but the desire of fire consumeth the Substantiality.</P>
<P>Indeed the Image dwelleth in the fire of the Soul, as Light dwelleth in the fire, but it hath another Principle, as the Light is such a Source, as is different from the fire.</P>
<P>And so the true Image of God dwelleth in the Light of the fire of the Soul; which Light, the fiery Soul must create in the Fountain of the Love of God, in the Ma|jesty, by putting and yielding its Imagination into it.</P>
<P>But if the Soul do not so, but putteth its Imagination into it self, into its wrathful form of the Source of the fire, and not into the fountain of Love, into the Light of God, then its own Source of forceness, astringency and bitterness riseth up, and the Image of God becom|eth a <HI>Turba,</HI> and swalloweth up the similitude of God in the wrath.</P>
<P>And then the astringent <HI>Fiat</HI> in the fiery Essence of the Soul figureth for the Soul an Image of the imagi|nation, that is, in its Will: VVhatsoever the essential fire of the Soul desireth, that will be the figure in the Soul, <HI>viz.</HI> earthly Figures, that which the will of the Heart casteth it self into, that image the <HI>Fiat</HI> of the Soul will make, that is, as far as the third Principle, and the spirit of the Stars and Elements hath power.</P>
<P>So that if the will of the Soul do cast it self into the Kingdom of this world, then the outward Kingdom hath power to bring its imagination into the inward Principle, and if the inward <HI>Fiat</HI> perceive that in the fire of the Soul, then it becometh pregnant with it, and keepeth it.</P>
<P>And then the Soul hath the image of a Beast in the third Principle, and that cannot be destroyed forever, except the will of the <HI>soul</HI> return again out of the <HI>earthly Lust,</HI> and pierce into the Love of God again, and then it getteth the image of God again, which may be done only in this Life, while the Soul is essentially in its <HI>Ether,</HI> in the growing of its Tree, but after this Life it can|not be done.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="000447_0066_0FA5AECA90ECD320">Thus you may understand what the Soul, Spirit, Image and Turba are; the Soul dwelleth in it self, and is an essential Fire, and its image standeth in it self in the imagination&punc; in the light of the Soul, if it cleave to God, if not, then it is an Anxiety in the wrath of dark|ness, and is an abominable Image, or an image of the Devil.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turba</HI> of the Soul which destroyeth the divine Image, is the essential wrathfulness, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s caused by the imagination, or false love and representation, and therefore all lieth in the Imagination, the Image con|sisteth in that which we suffer to come into our desire.</P>
<P>If the will of the Soul, change it self, then its form will be also changed: For if the source of the Soul be fiery, then it hath also a fiery Image, if the Soul turn its ima|gination into the centre, into the strong Astringency and Bitterness, then its fair Image is also captivated in the dark Astringency, and infected with astringent wrath. And then this wrath is a <HI>Turba,</HI> which possesseth the Image, and destroyeth the similitude of God; for in God there is Love, Light and Meekness; but in this Image there is darkness, astringency and bitterness.</P>
<P>Again, the Soul in its real Life and Understanding, consists in three Kingdoms: The 1<HI>st</HI> is, the eternal nature, <HI>viz.</HI> the potent Might of Eternity, the dark &amp; fire-world, according to which God calleth himself <HI>a strong zealous angry God, and a consuming Fire,</HI> in which the Devil hath wholly plunged and diabolized himself.</P>
<P>The <HI>second</HI> is the holy light world, where the eternal understanding hath displayed it self through the Fires sharpness, in the light of the great fiery Love-desire, and turned the wrathful Darkness and fiery Property, to a Kingdom of Joy, which is the true manifestation of the Deity, and is called the holy Heaven of the angelical delight and bliss.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> Kingdom is the outward Astral &amp; Elemental Kingdom, <HI>viz.</HI> the Air, with its dominering Constellations,

<HEAD>Of the Eternal Predistination, and Election of God.</HEAD>
<P>WHen the Scripture speaks of God's eternal pur+pose, or Predistination, it speaketh not of a pur+pose or predistination that hath been long before, for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God there is no beginning, but there is an eternal be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ginning, where the beginning and the end is all one, the first is continually the last, and the last first: whatsoever God hath begun from Eternity to foresee that he begin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">neth now also at this day always every <HI>moment</HI> to foresee&punc;</P>
<P>I can say with good ground thus, that if I were in my Mother's Body or Womb comprehended in his Anger then God hath from Etern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty seen me &amp; apprehended me in his Anger, &amp; I were from Eternity elected in his <HI>anger</HI>&punc;</P>

whatsoever at this day beginneth to alter in the eter|nal, that is from Eternity to Eternity, equally in the Eternity, the matter consists only in the Conversation of the Will.</P>
<P>And though it standeth written, <HI>that it standeth not in man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s willing,</HI> that is only concerning those that desire God, and yet will not go forth out of their sinful Will, they keep their Sin, and yet will be saved; therefore it lieth not in his willing, but in this, that man go out from Sin into God's Grace, and then it lieth in the mer|cy, and that God doth readily, for he hath promised it.</P>
<P>Therefore men should better consider the Scripture, as to such Terms or Expressions; for it often speaketh out of the eternal Mouth, which beginneth every moment.</P>
<P>For when the Scripture saith, <HI>he hardneth their Hearts that they believe not, and so come not to be saved</HI>&punc;, then it speaketh of those who would be saved by their own Ability, and their evil Will and Life, those he suffereth to go on in their purpose or predistination, for they will do it.</P>
<P>As also <HI>Adam</HI> did, he would not be resigned into God, as a Child, but be his own, and apprehend and know Good and Evil, and live in all the three Principles; for he went out from God's will into his own off-set purpose, and God left him, and then he fell down and slept.</P>
<P>And when he had eat the forbidden Fruit, then God's anger elected him to the damnation of Death, and God's love spoke against it, saying, <HI>The Seed of the Woman shall bruise or crush the Serpent's Head</HI>; and that was also the eternal Election, and yet it was also a beginning tempo|rary Election; for how can an Election pass upon a thing when as yet it hath no Root?</P>
<P>God's Anger hath from Eternity continually, and still at this very day, electeth it self to be a Darkness, that God's Love and Light might in the Anger become ma|nifest or revealed.</P>

<HEAD>Of Free-Will.</HEAD>
<P>NOw that which is out of the Eternal, as the Soul of man, that hath also free-will to manifest it self in the Light or in the Darkness; not that it hath the Light or Dark|ness in its power, but it hath ability to work in good or evil, that is in the power of the Light or of the Darkness, and in which soever it worketh, that manifesteth it self in it.</P>
<P>The might or power is God's, and the Soul is his Child, a branch in the Tree, proceeded out of God's Mouth, out of Love and Anger; all that lieth in it, and is its own property; who will then take away the Free-will from it, being it is a branch of the eternal Tree, &amp; hath Love and Anger in it self?</P>
<P>For the Fire-Soul is a Root proceeded from the divine Om|nipotence, and therefore it hath Free-will, and nothing can deprive it, and therefore it may conceive either in the Fire or Light.</P>
<P>The Souls free-will is as thin as a nothing, and though it be in its Body indeed, encompassed with the something, yet its amassed or conceived something is in a false distinguished Essence by reason of the original of Sin.</P>
<P>Now if the free-will would approach to God with the De|sire, then it must depart out of its false something; and if it now doth so depart, then it is bare and impotent, for it is again in the first nothing: For if it would come to God then it must dye to its false self-hood, and forsake it, and if it forsakes the same, then it is barely and meerly as nothing, and so it cannot go work or move: if it will shew its Might, then it must be in something wherein it doth imaginate and form it self. But when a man will say, man cannot turn his Will towards that which is good, <HI>viz.</HI> towards Grace, that is groundless; Grace indeed standeth in the <HI>Abiss</HI> of the Creature in all wicked m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and the Will need only stand still from wicked working, and then it beginneth as to its self-will, to dive down into the <HI>Abiss.</HI> For that which standeth still standeth still together with the eternal One, and becometh one Substance therewith.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="000447_0070_0FA5AED122701DC8">Can the Will be obedient to a worldly Lord and Master, and for that end stand still for which he would have him? wherefore not also to God, especially when the Ability is as soon given, as a man doth but incline his Will to stand still?</P>
<P>It is better to know nothing, then to Will according to self, for that which knoweth nothing, the will of that passeth away, with the Creaturely Life, and its strife hath an end, and hath no more source of Torment, as we may understand in irrational Creatures.</P>
<P>For it is the Source and Torment of all the damned that are wishing and woulding, <HI>viz.</HI> they would that which is Self, and in their woulding they generate Ideas, Species and Formations, <HI>viz.</HI> contrary Wills and Desires, the Will being at strife, so that one thing is manifested in multiplicity, where|in it is at enmity with it self; but when it is one with the eternal One, then can no enmity be therein.</P>

<P>And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> according to the outward World, the Air-Spirit, with the Quality or Source of the Stars and Ele|ments&mdash;Thus hath man received a three-fold Life, the Spi|rit of all the three Worlds.</P>
<P>Therefore we should rightly consider man what he is, &amp; not made an earthly Beast of him; and also make no Angel of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> part; he hath the inward Spirit out of the first Prin|ciple but he should not rule therewith, also not with the out|ward, but give up himself to the holy Spirit in the second Principle, and in the outward Life be as a Child in the Mo|ther's Bosom or Lapp.</P>
<P>The Soul standeth in three Principles, <HI>viz.</HI> in the eternal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine's Nature, and in the eternal Light's Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Love Fire, which extinguished in <HI>Adam,</HI> for which cause <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt the strife is, And thirdly, it standeth in the King|dom of this World&punc; <HI>viz.</HI> in Mortality and Restoration.</P>

else there would be no sighing, or longing after another thing.</P>
<P>For we know that every Substance sigheth after that out of which it had its first Original; and so our Will sigheth after such a Flesh as God created.</P>
<P>So we clearly understand that we are gone forth out of the Eternal into the Corruptible: For <HI>Adam</HI>'s imagination hath drawn the earthly Quality of the Stars and four Ele|ments into the Limus, and the Stars and Elements have drawn in the longing Malady of the Earth. And thus the heaven|ly Matter of the heavenly Flesh became earthly.</P>
<P>The true <HI>Ens</HI> of the Soul, which the Word assumed in the Name Jesus, was of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> men from the Female tincture, <HI>viz.</HI> from the true <HI>Adamical</HI> Soul, yet from the Property of the Light, which was severed from <HI>Adam</HI> and put into the Woman, that this Property of the Light might transmute or change the fiery Masculine property again into the Love and divine Humility, and that the Masculine and Feminine property might be quite changed into one Image again, as <HI>Adam</HI> was before his <HI>Eve,</HI> when he was neither Man nor Woman, but a Masculine Virgin.</P>
<P>Therefore Christ took his Soul from a Woman, <HI>viz.</HI> from a Virgin, and yet was a Man; so that he rightly stood in the <HI>Adamical</HI> Image, and brought the averted severed Proper|ties of Life, in which our Will had broken it self off from God, again into the temperature and union, <HI>viz.</HI> into that one.</P>
<P>For <HI>Adam</HI> turned his Will from the only Will of God, and Jesus Christ took our Soul again into the only Will of God, and turned the will of our Soul in our Humanity, which he assumed into the only will of God again.</P>
<P>We poor Children of <HI>Eve</HI> should not in Eternity, as to the Body, have returned again, but our Soul would have eternal|ly continued in God's anger, source or quality with all Devils.</P>
<P>But the becoming Man, or Incarnation of Jesus Christ is become a powerful Substance or Matter to us; for, for our sakes is God become Man, that he might bring our Huma|nity out of Death into himself, and redeem or release our Soul out of the Fire of God's anger.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="000447_0073_0FA5AED35A5CE2D8">And we now with good ground of truth say, that the possi|bility of the New-birth is in all men, else God were divided and not in one place as he is in another.

<P>Also it is plain and clear enough, that [as Jesus ascend|ed to Heaven, so] he will come again in the same Form at the last Day with a divine and glorified Body, as a Prince of the holy Angels, which shall be the men Angels.</P>
<P>Also, we know the becoming Man, or Incarnation of Christ to be natural, as of all the Children of men, the Lord gave himself to be under the Servant, that the Servant might be|came living, and is in like manner in nine Months become a perfect man, and also continueth a true God&mdash;become born into the world through that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and passage as all men are.</P>

<P>The earthly part which he took to himself out of his Mo|ther <HI>Mary,</HI> that is, to or upon the divine Substance, dyed away on the Cross.</P>
<P>Thus was the Soul in the Substantiality of God, and as a victorious conquering Prince went into the Hell of Devils, that is into God's Anger, and quenched it with God's Love and Meekness of the divine Substantiality.</P>
<P>For the Love-Fire came into the Anger-Fire, and drowned

the Anger, wherein the Devil would be God; thus was the Devil taken captive with the Darkness, and lost his domi|nion: The Spirit of Christ took the Devil captive, and drove him out of the Fire of the Soul, and cast him into Darkness, and shut him up under darkness out from the Fire of the Soul, and out from God's fire into the wrathful harshness and bitterness in Cold.</P>
<P>Consider the first four Forms of Nature, and you will understand what the Devil's Mansion is; for before Christ came, he kept the Soul captive in the <HI>Turba</HI> with the Fire, and though he had not the Spirit of the Soul, yet he had the Root of it in the <HI>Turba,</HI> but then he was commanded to cease.</P>
<P>While the earthly man liveth, the Soul is continually in hazard or danger, for the Devil hath enmity with, who con|tinually casteth forth his streams, with false and wicked Ima|ginations into the Stary and Elementary Spirit, and reach|eth or graspeth therewith after the Soul's fire, and willeth continually to infect the same with earthly Devils longing and malady.</P>
<P>There must the noble Image defend it self against the Souls fire, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d there it costeth striving and fighting for the Angels Garland: there riseth up often in the old <HI>Adam</HI> anguish, doubting and unbelief, when the Devil sets upon the Soul.</P>

<P>Thus every little Sprout groweth in the Soul out of the divine Wisdom: It must all press forth out of the Anguish-Chamber&punc; as a Sprout out of the Root of a Tree, it is all ge|nerated in the Anguish.</P>

by the Darkness, and bringeth it self from Eternity to the darkness into the Source or Quality, even into the Fire, and in the rising up of the Fire is the eternal Death, where the Darkness and Light seperate themselves each into a Principle in it self, and the Light also it self po|sesseth it self, one dwelleth in the other unapprehended by the other; there is in Eternity no parting asunder: Those that dwell in the Darkness, see not the Light, and those that dwell in the Light see no Darkness: God would not be manifested or revealed, and there would be no Nature nor Creature without the darkness.</P>
<P>Observe now, God's anger maketh the dark mind full of God's Love, maketh the Light mind full. For whosoever hath, to them it will be given.</P>
<P>But now all standeth in Strife, the Light against the Darkness, and the Life against the Death, and the Death against the Life: But Man is out of the great Substance of all Substances, and in him is the Strife.</P>
<P>Dost thou say, <HI>God can make of me what he will, he is Omnipotent:</HI> He maketh of thee what thou wilt, his Love is omnipotent, and also his Anger; that which getteth thee, holdeth thee. The Wicked is to God a good savour to Death; and the Saint or Holy is so to the eternal holy Life as thou growest; so thou art such Sap as thou drawest into thy self, such Fruit thou bear|est: It is not said, God will not be mine, but thou wilt not be his, and so you are parted.</P>
<P>But he cannot make himself a Child, he goeth only with the Will into the Matrix, and then the divine <HI>Fiat</HI> apprehendeth him, and maketh him one; indeed he cannot make himself a Devil, the hellish <HI>Fiat,</HI> according to the dark world's Property maketh him one, when he doth but give his Will up thereto.</P>
<P>Therefore rightly saith the Apostle. <HI>To whom you give your selves Servants in obedience, his Servants you are whether of God's Love or Anger.</HI> Here the Apostle speaks of man's Election, that man can give up himself, and be given
<PB N="72" REF="000447_0079_0FA5AEDA124C3058">
up; and though indeed of himself he cannot take or receive, yet God giveth him the taking or receiving, for he hath promised it him.</P>
<P>We believe a Resurrection of our Bodies which we had here; it is not the earthly Body that is the Image, which shall live eternally, but the Heavenly, which the earthly body here holdeth captive in Death; but if Christ become born therein, then it is no more in death, but liveth in Christ, and is only covered with the earth|ly body.</P>
<P>It is not the Husk, <HI>viz.</HI> the beastial Flesh that shall arise, but the Life in the outward Mystery with the wonders, that shall be comprised in the holy Element, and be united with the Body of Christ [even] of the new man, and in Eternity stand with its wonders in it.</P>
<P>Seek not Christ's flesh in the four Elements in the Spirit of the outward world, but in the Root of them, <HI>viz.</HI> in the holy Element, a Principle deeper then this world is; not absent from the outward body.</P>
<P>Let no man think it will come to pass, that men will come, who will teach or compel the holy Spirit with Authority or Power into men: No&punc; it is said, <HI>To day when you hear the Voice of the Lord, harden not your Hearts and Ears</HI>: Expect not another time, for this is the time of your Visitation; incline your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ars and Hearts into the Temple of Christ in you.</P>
<P>Let none wait for a golden Time, wherein the holy Spirit out of, or from the outward Month, will cry in|to the hardned into his beastial VVill, who will live only in the Lust of the Flesh: O! No that is not to be done; The time is already come that <HI>Henoch</HI> teacheth, and <HI>Noah</HI> declareth the Deludge of Sin.</P>
<P>Let none wait for the outward Prophet, he appeareth or shineth inwardly in the Spirit, the outward man will not know him; the right way into the eternal Life is in man: VVhosoever will enter in with <HI>Sion,</HI> and praise God in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> hath now the acceptable time, the sound of

<P>Christ, <HI>viz.</HI> the anointed of God, penetrateth only, or presseth upon the Humanity, not upon all Creatures; he uniteth himself to no Creature but man; he hath also with his Incarnation, Suffering, D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing and R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|surrection delivered no Creature but man.

<P>The man Christ is the first that arose from the dead&punc; in the anointing, and is also the first, who in the anoint|ing dyed to the human l-hood: He is only and alone the Lamb of God, in whom God brake his wrath in pieces; <HI>Abel</HI> and all Martyrs are his Members, upon whom the breaking Death in pieces pressed or penetra|ted out of this Lamb Christ: when Christ arose from the Dead, then <HI>Abel</HI> also arose in Christ's anointing in Christ's humanity, out of Christ's death, and lived in the anointing of Christ.</P>

Saint before Christ's birth, but only in the Spirit of the Deity, in a prophetick manner, and not in a human manner: By the woman's Seed is always understood the <HI>Paradise</HI> which faded or disappeared in <HI>Adam,</HI> viz. the heavenly Corporiety from the pure Element, and not the four Elements; this was manifest neither in <HI>Adam</HI> nor <HI>Abel,</HI> till the Saviour Christ became manifest in the Seed.</P>
<P>In all men lieth the heavenly Image, which disappear|ed in <HI>Adam,</HI> but it liveth in one, and in another it is un|lively. When the wicked turneth himself to God, and turneth the will of the Soul to God, then is Christ out of the disappeared Seed born a man and is set be|fore the Devil in the outward Flesh, for a crusher or bruiser of the Serpent, which hindreth and breaketh the Will of the evil Flesh, so that Sin is not committed.</P>
<P>And then there is a constant enmity, Christ governeth in his heavenly Flesh through the outward, and striketh the out<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ard Lust to the ground; then cometh the anger of God into the center of the Soul, and will also have its fierce wrathful Government, and the Devil with the false or wicked Lust crouds himself thereinto.</P>
<P>The three horrible Chains wherewith our Soul is fast bound, during the time of this earthly Life, is first the severe anger of God, the <HI>Abiss</HI> and dark world which is the centre and creaturely Life of the Soul; the second is the desire of the Devil against the Soul, whereby he cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly sifteth and tempteth the Soul, striving to thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it from the Truth of God into Vanity, <HI>viz.</HI> into Pride, Covetousness Envy and Anger, and with his de|sire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">loweth up and kindleth those evil Properties in the Soul, whereby the will of the Soul turneth away from&punc; and entreth into Self. The third and most hurt|ful Chain, is the corrupt and altogether vain, earthly and mortal Flesh and Blood, full of evil Desires and Inclinations.</P>
<P>It is then necessary that we convert with our Wills,
<PB N="57" REF="000447_0082_0FA5AEDCC42DB3C0">
and enter again into the New-Birth, and Christ giveth us his Body to eat, and his Blood to drink, but not to the man of Sin, but to the man in Christ new born to Life, <HI>viz.</HI> that from the divine world's substance to the <HI>Paradisical</HI> man, which hath a heavenly Mouth to per|take with.</P>
<P>For Christ dwelleth in Heaven, &amp; feedeth us with his Body and Blood in the Heaven, this Heaven is in man, <HI>Adam</HI> eateth of the four Elements, and is fed with evil and good; <HI>Adam</HI> the outward Flesh man sinneth the in|ward man willeth not the Sin, therefore saith <HI>Paul, Now if I sin, it is not I that do it, but it is the sinful desire which dwelleth in the Flesh: Now therefore with my mind I serve God, and with my Flesh the Law of Sin; for I do that which I would not, but if I now do it, it is not I that do it, but Sin in the Flesh.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore let the Christian Reader that loveth truth, he warned according to my bounden duty and love will, not to esteem himself perfect, and to set himself in the omnipotent power or virtue of God in the Omniscience, and to say he is without Sin, and cannot sin.</P>
<P>Our whole Life should be a continual Repentance, for it is even a continual sinning; and though indeed the noble Lilly-branch new generated or born in Christ's spirit sinneth not; yet the earthly man in Soul and Body sinneth, and willeth continually to break or destroy the noble Rose-bud again, and altogether ob|scure it.</P>
<P>Here is the Field where the Fruit groweth, let none be perswaded to such slugishness, and to lie on such a soft Bed, as to think he is fairly grown, and quite or full blossomed: O No! no, by no means, but con|tinually without ceasing draw divine Essence to thy self, in the greatest Humility, from and out of Gods Love, as a Bee doth Honey out of the fair blossom of Flowers; for as soon as man is secure or careless, and thinketh he is holy Honey, then the Devil bringeth to him poyson in

<P>As soon as the Soul eateth of it self, and of the Light of Reason, it goeth on in its own Opinion, and then its doings which it sets for divine, are but from the out|ward Constellation, which presently then layeth hold on the Soul, and maketh it dry, and then the Soul go|eth on in Errors, till it yield it self up again into resig|nation, and acknowledging it self anew to be a defiled Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld, resisteth Reason, and so getteth the Love of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od again, which is harder to do now, then it was at first&punc; for the Devil bringeth in strong doubts, he will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> easily leave h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ort of prey.</P>
<P>This may be seen clearly in the Saints of God from the beginning of the world, that many who have been driven by the Spirit of God, have yet often-time departed from Resignation into Self, <HI>viz.</HI> into their own Reason and Will, in which Satan hath cast the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> into Sins, and into the anger of God.

<P>The Imagination ariseth out of the Tinctures, which kindle the <HI>Mercury</HI> with their Lust, and the <HI>Mercury</HI> kind|leth the Spirit of the Life, and now existeth the Lust and Will in the Heart, <HI>viz.</HI> a vehement desire; the tenderer the Complexion is, the nobler also is the Tincture in its sweet desire.</P>

<P>And though it be at best, yet it is a thing that is in all Beasts, it is natural; and when men will give it the best and rightest Name, then it is called an Abomination before God's Holiness, being a thing existed out of Sin, through <HI>Adam's</HI> fall; which indeed is born withal under divine pa|tience, seeing is cannot be otherwise, of which we could take many Examples in the holy Scriptures.</P>

<P><HI>In the highest</HI> Mercury <HI>is the highest sharpest proof of all things; the more poyonful a thing is, the more sharply it proveth a thing; for the sharpest taste and smell cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sts in the greatest Poyson</HI>&punc; viz. <HI>in a dying Source.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now we are to consider of the Serpent which deceived</HI> Adam <HI>with his craft; the Kingdom of Wrath and also the outward Kingdom was manifest in the Serpent, for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was more subtil then any Beast of the Field, and this subtilty</HI> Eve <HI>desired.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Devil was a fair Angel, and the Serpent the subtile Beast, and Man the likeness of the Deity: Now all three were corrupted by Imagination and Pride, and got the Curse of God for their false Lust [or cunning.]</HI></P>
<P><HI>All whatsoever is eternal&punc; proceedeth originally from one ground, as Angels and Souls; but the Serpent is not out of the eternal ground, but out of the beginning of Time; all

things were good in the beginning, also the Devil was good while he was an Angel; so also the Serpent [was good in it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Creation before the Curse.</HI>]</P>
<P>But being the Devil went into the highest Fire's de|sire, God parted from him as a light that is put out, or extinguished in a Candle, and afterwards he lived ac|cording to his own desire.</P>
<P>But seeing he knew that there was such a Tincture in the Serpent, and the Serpent being created out of the beginning of Time; therefore he insinuated with his desire into the Serpent&punc; and took possession of the Ser|pent's Tincture, and wrought forth his desire through the Serpent against Man, to introduce him to long af|ter the Serpent's property; for the Serpent's tincture was from both Originals, <HI>viz.</HI> out of the deadly <HI>Mer|cury</HI>&punc; from the dying in the Fire, <HI>viz.</HI> from the coldness in the Impression, and then also from the wrathful [fiery property in the impression] the cold Impression is earth|ly, which ariseth from the Wrath, <HI>viz.</HI> from the dying in the Wrath in the Impression; and the fiery [Impres|sion] ariseth from the quick poyson of <HI>Mercury,</HI> in which property the Spirit's life consisteth.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> was infected with the Devil's desire through the Serpent, <HI>viz.</HI> through the earthly deadly property, and also [through] the wrathful li|ving property of God's wrath, according to the Devil's own property, and was inflamed in his divine Oyl, that is, in the heavenly Essentiality; even then the divine Light which shone out of the divine Body of the hea|venly Essentiality was extinct in him, for the Curse seized upon the Soul. Now God's cursing is a with|drawing, <HI>viz.</HI> the divine Power which was in the Body departed into its own Principle, and his holy Oyl [where|in the Power of God dwelt, and had made a Kingdom of Joy, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Paradise</HI>] became a Poyson.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Adam</HI> dyed unto God, and lived to Death; here it was necessary that God should regenerate him, and
<PB N="85" REF="000447_0092_0FA5AEE4A2D69828">
therefore the Serpent was cursed, because it had served and willingly obeyed the Devil.</P>
<P>We declare with good ground, that there is nothing so bad, but there lieth a good therein, but the badness is not capable of the good: Also, there lieth in the most poysonful <HI>Mercury</HI> the greatest Pearl and Jewel, if his poyson-will may be introduced into the same&punc; then he himself manifests the Pearl, for he changeth himself.</P>
<P>The Power of the Most-high hath given to all things, even to every one according to its property, a fixt Per|fection; for all was very good, as <HI>Moses</HI> saith, but with the Curse the <HI>Turba</HI> is introduced, so that the Proper|ties do stand in the Strife of <HI>Mercury,</HI> yet in each pro|perty in every Herb, or whatsoever is [I say] in what|soever doth grow, or arise out of the walm of the four Elements, there is a fixity hidden; for all things which are in the four Elements, are originally sprung forth out of the eternal Element, in which there is no Strife, neither heat nor cold, but all things were in equal weight, of all the Properties in a Love-play, as it is even so now in <HI>Paradise</HI>; and the same <HI>Paradise</HI> sprung forth in the beginning of this World [before the Curse] through the Earth: thus it is also yet hidden in all things, and may be opened by Understanding and Art, so that the first Virtue may overcome the inflamed Malignity.</P>
<P>Albeit we men have not full power to do it in self-might, yet it may be done in God's permission, who hath again turned his Mercy towards us, and again opened <HI>Paradise,</HI> and its comprehension in man: Hath God given us Power to become his Children, and to rule over the world? wherefore then not over the Curse of the Earth? Let none hold it for impossible, there is required only a divine understanding and knowledge thereunto, which shall blossom in the time of the Lilly, and not in <HI>Babel,</HI> for whom we also have not written.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>MAn is the greatest <HI>Arcanum,</HI> or secret Mistery that God ever wrought, he hath the figure and is the simi|litude, shewing how the Deity hath exgenerated it self from Eternity out of the fierce Wrath out of the Fire, by the sink|ing through Death into another Principle, of another Source or Quality.</P>
<P>For thus is he also exgenerated out of Death again, and groweth out of Death again into another Principle, of ano|ther Source and Quality, and Virtue, or Power, wherein he is quite free from Earthliness.</P>
<P>And it is very good that we are with the earthly part fallen home to the Earth, inasmuch as we also retain the divine part; for so we are wholly pure, and come wholly perfect without any Lust, Suggestion or Infection of the Devil into the Kingdom of God again; and are a much greater <HI>Arca|num,</HI> or secret Mistery then the Angels.</P>
<P>We shall also, as to the heavenly Substantiality, excel them, for they are flames of Fire throughly illustrated with the Light, but we attain the great Source or Quality of the Meekness and Love, which floweth forth in God's holy Sub|stantiality.</P>
<P>Therefore they do very wrongfully&punc; and fasly, who say, God willeth not to have all men in Heaven; He willeth that all should be saved or helped, the Fault is in man himself, that he will not suffer himself to be saved or helped.</P>
<P>And although many be of an evil Inclination, that pre|ceedeth not from God, but from the Mother of Nature; if they lay the blame on God, they lye, God's Spirit with-draw|eth it self from no man.</P>
<P>The noble Jewel in them standeth hidden in the noble centre in the divine Principle; and they can very well with their willing, go forth out of the earthly Substance and Malice, or Wickedness, into the willing of God.</P>
<P>But they wilfully and obstinately let the fierce Wrath hold them; for the proud stately self-honouring Life pleaseth them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oo well, and that holdeth them also.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="000447_0100_0FA5AF33498F0D50">After this time there is no remedy more; but in this time, while the Soul swimeth and burneth in the Blood, it may well be, for the Spirit of God goeth upon the Wings of the Wind, God is become Man.</P>
<P>The Spirit of God goeth with the willing into the Soul, it desireth the Soul, it setteth its <HI>Magia</HI> towards the Soul, the Soul needs only to open the Door, and so it goeth voluntarily in, and openeth the noble Grain to the Tree of the Christian-Faith.</P>
<P>Cast away your Evil or Wickedness, and enter into meek|ness, press into the Truth and Love, and yield thy self up to God, and so thou wilt be saved or helped.</P>
<P>Thou wilt say, <HI>I am kept back that I cannot.</HI> Yes in|deed, that is right, thou willest to have it so; the Devil also would have it so.</P>
<P>Art thou a Champion? why dost thou not strive or fight against the Evil? But if thou strivest or fightest against the good, thou art an enemy to God. Art thou an Enemy? then thou art no Friend; if thou be a friend, then forsake thy enmity and hatred, and go to the Father, and so thou art a Son.</P>
<P>If thou sayest, <HI>I am of an evil Source or Quality, and cannot, I am kept back.</HI> Very well, let the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vil Source or Quality be as it is, but go thou with thy Will-Spirit into God's Love-Spirit, and give up thy self into his Mercy: Thou wilt once well be freed from the evil Source, or Quality.</P>
<P>Concerning the evil Body, which sticketh full of evil Af|fections, there is not much to be done; if it be inclined to evil, do it the less good, give it no occasion to wantonness.</P>
<P>To keep it in subjection, is a good Remedy; to be sober, and to lead a temperate Life, is a good Purgation for the evil Ass; not to give it that it lusteth after, to let it fast often, so that it may not hinder Prayer, that is good for it; it is not willing, but the Vnderstanding must be Lord&punc; for it beareth God's Image&mdash;This <HI>Latine</HI> doth not relish well to the rational world in the Lusts of the Flesh.</P>
<P><HI>Reader,</HI> who lovest God, know that a man is the true
<PB N="94" REF="000447_0101_0FA5AF38235D7F50">
similitude of God, which God highly loveth and manifesteth himself in this similitude, as in his own; God is in man the middlemost.</P>
<P>But he dwelleth only in himself; and if it be so, that the Spirit of man become one Spirit with him, then he manifest|eth himself in the Humanity, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Mind, Thoughts and Desirings, so that the mind feeleth him.</P>
<P>Else in this World he is very much too subtil to be beheld by us, only the Thoughts behold him in the Spirit, under|stand, in the willing Spirit; for the Will sendeth the Thoughts into God, and God giveth himself into the Thoughts.</P>
<P>And then the Thoughts bring the Power of God to the Will, and the Will receiveth them with joy, but with trembling [or quaking] for it acknowledgeth it self unworthy, seeing it proceedeth out of a rough Lodging, <HI>viz.</HI> out of a wavering mind; and therefore it receiveth the Power in the sinking down before God.</P>
<P>Thus out of its triumph, cometh a soft gentle Meekness to be, that is, God's true Substance, and it apprehendeth that very Substance: And that conceived or apprehended Substance is in the willing, the heavenly Body, and is called the true and right Faith&punc; which the Will hath received in the Power of God, the same sinketh or demerseth it self into the mind and dwelleth in the Fire of the Soul.</P>
<P>Thus the Image of God is entire or total, and God see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> or findeth himself in such a similitude.</P>

<P>ALl Sadness and Fear wherewith a man terrifies and amazeth himself, is in his inward man, from the Soul; for the outward Spirit, which hath its Origin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l from the Stars and Elements, is not in this sort troubled, because he lives in his Mother which bore him: but t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e poor Soul is with <HI>Adam</HI> entred into a forreign Harbour&punc; <HI>viz.</HI> into the Spirit of this World, wherewith the beau|tiful Creature is vailed and captivated, as in a darksom Prison.</P>
<P>Now the Spirit of this world hath four sorts of Lodgings, wherein the pretious Jewel is shut up; of these four there is but one principally manifest to one man, as 'tis with the four Elements, which every man hath in himself, and is himself the same beeing, except his Soul, which is not of that Essence, though it lie as a Prisoner in it: And of these four Lodgings or Image<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one only hath the predominance in his Life, the <HI>Names</HI> of them are; 1. <HI>Cholorick</HI>; 2. <HI>Sanguine</HI>; 3. <HI>Phlegmatick</HI>; 4. <HI>Melancholy.</HI></P>
<P>The first, <HI>viz.

<P>Is the Soul's life cloathed [encompassed] with the <HI>Cholerick</HI> Complexion, then is it fiery, furious, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ugh|ty and fretting, subject to Fury and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rath; and if the Soul imagin therein, then doth it yet more veheme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly kindle and enflame the Complexion, the Soul it self be|ing of a fiery Nature.

Disposiitons operative in such a man, <HI>viz.</HI> Anger, Pride, an ambitious Desire to br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng all men in subjection under him; he is an insulter over [despiser of] those that be in misery, and a Tyrant over those that are in sub|jection to him; he cares not though he dye in Anger, except it come to pass that the Stars hinder, which oft joyning themselves with the Complexion lay a barr in the way, and hinder many things.</P>
<P>There is great danger in this Complexion, if the Soul live according to the outward Imagination, and the band is the harder [stronger] there being one fiery Essence linked to another.</P>
<P>The fierce Devil hath a powerful approach to this Complexion, for the Fire's property is his Servant; the Devil is also proud and envious, so is this Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">exion.

<P>The Soul desires in its Pomp to make a glorious show out of its fiery Complexion, and in the height of its Pride and Arrogance will be reputed holy O thou Devil in an Angel's shape! how dark art thou when the fiery glance of thy Complexion comes to be put out by Death.</P>

Fire the Soul. Now the Fire must have fewel, <HI>viz.</HI> either the outward Complexion, or a divine Essentia|lity of God's Nature&punc; of one of these must it eat or dye, but 'tis not possible for it to perish, seeing it is a desire, and where there is a desiring there is also a beeing, the desire makes a beeing to it self.</P>
<P>By this we understand, whence ariseth such a differ|rence in the Wills and Actions of men: For what the Soul eats, and wherein its Fire-life is kindled th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reaf|ter, doth the life of the Soul exercise its Regiment.</P>
<P>If the Soul goes out of its Complexion, into God's Love-fire into the heavenly Essentiality [which is Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s corporiety, according to the Angelical light-world] then it eats of Christ's heavenly Flesh, of his eternal Essentiality, of the mildness of the majestick Light, in which the Fire of God the Father in the glance [resplen|dance of the Light] makes a Tincture in the same Essentiality in the Water-fountain of everlasting Life&punc; whereof Christ speaks, saying, that he would give us such water to drink.</P>
<P>When the Soul eats of God's word, the Complexion, according to the outward Life, becomes powerful, and as it were captive, though it live in it self. But the Soul is so stedfast and faithful before God's love, which alone comes to help it [in the combat] that oft when it eats of God's love and essence, then it induceth a tri|umph&punc; and a divine taste into the Complexion it self, that the whole Body begins to be rouzed up into a trem|bling, and height of Joy, as if <HI>Paradise</HI> were now ap|proaching; but his condition proves not durable, for the Soul is shortly after over-shadowed with something of another Nature&punc; which is insinuated into the Com|plexion by the outward imagination&punc; by the Spirit of the great World&punc; whereof the Soul makes a Looking-glass and begins to contemplate in it with its outward Imag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nation. Thus goes the Soul out from the Spirit of God, and is oft bemired in the Dirt, were it not

that the Virgin VVisdom of God should call her again to Conversion, which is here set down for a Looking-glass for Souls. But to return:</P>

<P>If the Soul be cloathed with this Complexion, and will fix its Imagination and Life in it then doth it de|mean it self friendly, is also subtil, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">rous to try ma|ny things. It likewise comes to pass, whatsoever the Constellations models forth, it experiments it in its Complexion; it is naturally cheerful, yet soon amazed at the terrors of the Fire's power, but in it self it is great in its own conceit without advice; the Complexion gives it a sharp understanding, according to the outward Spirit: It doth not ordinarily transgress through Anger: It is soon lifted up into a heighth of Spirit, and as soon cast down, as the Air, easily moveable: It must look well to it self, the Devil is much enraged against it, being not able to get much advantage on it [but] he en|deavours to perplex it with variety of Imaginations, that it may not fix its thoughts upon God's Kingdom; he represents strange things to its Fancy, for it to spend its time in: and it self delights in various Studies. The Stars inject their Imaginations into the Air, and from hence her Fancy is filled with many strange wide wander|ing thoughts: it receives naturally the Starry pro|perty and knowledge into its Essence.</P>
<P>The man converseth humbly, friendly, candidly and peaceably with all men; yet doth the Devil set on his Enemies against him, whence he must suffer much, but glides easily like the soft Air through all, and seldom is he troubled with much Sadness.</P>
<P>For he having no fiery Complexion burning within his Heart, the fiery Terrors cannot much corrode his

<P N="3">3<HI>dly</HI>; When the Soul is cloathed with the <HI>Phlegma|tick</HI> Complexion, and swells up the principle of its life with it. It is of a dull, heavy swinish and rude temper of Life and Conversation, most perverse and careless; <HI>Knowledge</HI> must be infused into it by teaching&punc; for it finds it not in its own Root. It takes all in good part, troubles not it self with Grief, hath a glance of Light; is nei|ther extreamly sad or merry.</P>
<P>A man may make any thing out of this <HI>Complexion,</HI> the watry Spirit takes any Tincture to it self, be it good or bad; this Complexion makes likewise a hypocritical pretence to Holyness, and arrogates to it self the repute of an honest righteous Life, but 'tis not without mix|ture, and in this it resembles the glittering property of the Water. The Soul in this Complexion is not prone to take much notice of God's wrath and the dark world that lies hid in its centre, but rather bites greedily on the worldly Abominations, and hides it self under the Water-glance, supposing it to be the resplendence of the divine Light.</P>
<P>The Devil can introduce all the Villanies he exercises i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hell it self into this Complexion; and if the Stars hinder not, and the Soul will give away to it, he gets as much advantage here, as he doth in the Fire of the <HI>Cho|lerick</HI> Complexion; for Sin here is little regarded&punc; as the water-streams that pass away. He hath power like|wise to assault this Soul with Sadness, whensoever it goes about to oppose him; for he darkens the water-glance with the Sins foulness&punc; which the Soul had brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and shuts in the Soul in this dark Prison, that it can|not behold God: but when the Soul with a strong re|solution storms the Prison-Gates, it delivers it self&punc; the Devil can subsist here no longer&punc; the Complexion is too weak a hold, the Fire is his stronger Fortress.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="101" REF="000447_0108_0FA5AF3EA37CEA48">4thly; <HI>Of the</HI> Melancholy <HI>Complexion, and the Na|ture of the Sad mind.</HI></P>
<P>THe <HI>Melancholy</HI> Complexion resembles the sad Earth, which stands in perpetual fear before the wrath of God, which came into her in the Creation; re|ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns constantly in the House of Mourning, and even when the Sun shines in it, yet it is in it self sorrowful, it receives indeed some refreshment from the Sun's glance, but in the dark; the <HI>Melancholy</HI> nature is al|wayes in fear and horror of God's Judgments.</P>
<P>It gives a moderate understanding, yet of deep Co|gitations: The Complexion-Chamber stands open&punc; and is capable of much knowledge, if the way be not blocked up by too much Sadness.</P>
<P>Is the Soul cloathed with this Complexion, and takes nourishment from it? then doth its Fire burn extream dark; then it is likewise exceeding sad, esteems not much of any worldly Pomp, and is by reason of the Com|plexion always in heaviness; the Devil mightily assaults it&punc; being desirous to throw it head-long into the full possession of his Kingdom of Darkness.</P>
<P><HI>For he enters there gladly where Darkness has the pre|dominance; he makes strange Representations to the Soul, and frights it with the thoughts of its own Wickedness, that it may dispair of God's Grace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If the Soul once turn aside from God, and give it self over to the obedience of the Complexion, then all whatsoever the Stars work in the Complexion, is put in execution, and the Devil mixeth his Imagination therewith. But while it re|mains in the combat against the sadness of the Complexion, there is none among all the four Complexions, whereinto less Wickedness is introduced; for it is always in combat against the Devil, knowing him to be very near Neighbour; for the Darkness is his Habitation. Therefore doth he so willingly assault the</HI> Melancholy <HI>Soul, striving always to keep it either in Darkness, or else to throw her down Head|long
<PB N="102" REF="000447_0109_0FA5AF3FA553A618">
from the Hope in God, that it may dispair, and make away it self.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For he knows well what the Soul can do, if it once kindle God's light in it self, for then it fires his Garison over his Head, whereupon he remains in great Ignominy, and his Deceit is made manifest.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There is no Complexion wherein the Devil's will, with all his sly Suggestions, lie more open to the clearest discovery [if the Soul be once kindled in God's Light] then in the</HI> Melan|choly, <HI>as they that in the storming his Fort have felt his on|sets, well know. For they then in their enlightned Comple|xion see quickly what a shameless impure Harpy he is. After that he desires not to come near the Soul, except he finds it secure, and returning to feast it self [again] in the house of Sin&punc; then he comes as a fawning Spaniel, so as the Soul knows him not; strows Sugar upon its Viands&punc; holds forth to it nothing but shews of Friendliness and Piety, till he can bring it back again out of God's Light into the Complexion, that it feed upon its unwholsom sad-making nourishment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>O how cunningly doth he lay his Nets for the unwary Soul, as a Fowler for the Birds! oft he frights it in his Prayer&punc; [especially in the Night-time, when 'tis dark] in|jects his Imaginations into its, that it thinks now God's wrath seizes upon it, and will throw it into Hell: Then he makes semblance to have power over the Soul, as if it were his, though indeed he hath not power to touch one Hair of the Head, except it disappearingly yield it self over into its hands; he dares neither spiritually take possession of it, nor touch it, only darts his Temptations into its Imagination, through the Complexion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For this is the reason why he so assaults this Soul</HI>&punc; viz. <HI>be|cause the Complexion-chamber is dark, for into the Light he cannot intrude his Imaginations; 'tis man's Sin must give him entrance: but into this Complexion he finds an easie and most natural entrance, it being of a nature so near that of his own most desired home&punc; because its dark de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ire produces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, in which fear is an Inhabitant by rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on of the

wild Earth, except in this respect, he hath not one spark more of right to, or dominions in this, than the other Complexions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He can accomplish in the Imagination than only to affright the man, and make faint-hearted, if the Soul through dis|pair do not give over it self to him, then he induceth the man at last to make away himself; for except the man first cast away himself, he dare not lay Hands on him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Soul hath its free choice or will, and if it with-stand the Devil, and refuse consent, however des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rous he be, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et hath he not so much power as to touch the outward sinful Body; he boasts himself indeed&punc; as if he had this power, but he is a Lyar; for had he such power, he would soon shew it; but 'tis not so, Christ by his entrance into Death, and Hell's darkest Dungeons, set upon the Gate of Heaven for all Souls, each one hath now a free entrance; the Devil's strong Cords where with he fast bound the Soul in</HI> Adam, <HI>is broken assunder by the Cross. O how unwillingly does he hear the Cross mentioned, which serious<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y applyed [in the work of Mortification] is his most deadly Pestilence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Devil is ever objecting to the</HI> Melancholy <HI>man, the haniou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ness of his Sins; and thereupon seeks to perswade him there's no possibility of attaining God's grace &amp; favour: Therefore that it only remains, he disappearing, stab, drown or hang himself, or murther another, so that he may gain an approach to the Soul, otherwise he neither dare, nor can touch it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He dare not force thee&punc; nor indeed hath he any power to touch the Soul during this Life. For Christ hath unlockt the Door of Grace; it now stands open, wide to the poor Sinner, while he lives upon the Earth, this Door of Grace stands open in the Soul.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Christ hath in his Soul broke open the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">or-gate that was fast shut up in God's wrath. Now all S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uls have a com|munion and correspondance with this S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y all come from one, and are altogether one Tree&punc; with ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y Branches; his breaking open of that Prison is from him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> forth upon all Souls from</HI> Adam <HI>till the last men, the Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r of Grace stand&punc;

open to them all, God hath shut it up to none, but those that will needs exclude themselves. The sign or work of his in|gress into the Man-hood, is manifest to all Souls&punc; the same will be a witness over all ungodly men, in the Judgment day which they have despised.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Though our Sins (saith</HI> Esaias) <HI>were as red as Blood, yet stands the Door of Mercy still open, for in the Sinners conversion they shall be made as white as the snowy Wool.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Therefore let no Soul think the measure of mine Iniquities is full, God hath forgotten me, I cannot be saved: No, it cannot be so, he hath engraven it in his Nail-pierced-hands, it is a Sprig of the great Tree of all Souls, and hath an in|visible commerce and communion with all, as the Branch with the Tree, while it lives in this world, so long as it is cloath|ed with Flesh and Blood, it remains yet in the Tree.</HI></P>

<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Temptation arising from the Complexion and Influence of the Stars.</HEAD>
<P>IF the inward anguish or terror of Soul be not accompanyed with a kind of (outward) terrifying astonishment, then is the Devil not there present, but 'tis the Souls amazement which is affrighted at the inward risings of the dark Abiss&punc; or Principle of God's wrath in it. It thinks oft, when the <HI>Me|lancholy</HI> Complexion is kindled by some angry sower Influence of the Stars, that the Devil is there, when indeed there is no such matter. When he comes 'tis either with vehement astonishing Terrors, or in an Angels behaviour, or rather in a flattering posture like a fawning Hound.</P>
<P>All Temptation comes not from the Devil, especially with <HI>Melancholy</HI> men; but the most part of that afflicting Sad+ness comes from the Imagination of the Soul, which being necessitated to dwell in dark Melancholy Habitations, no wonder if it be easily surprised with heaviness, so as to think God hath forgotten it, and will have none of it.</P>
<P>For the Melancholy Complexion is dark, and hath no light of its own, as the other Complexions have; yet is not this Dark|ness essential to the Soul, but is only its lonesom Tabernacle
<PB N="105" REF="000447_0112_0FA5AF43023579B8">
during its Pilgrimage here on Earth; nor doth the Soul's Holiness and Righteousness consist at all in the Complexion, but in the inward heavenly Principle where God dwells: For as St. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Our Conversation is in Heaven.</HI> Now this Heaven wherein God dwells&punc; is not manifest in the outward Complexion, but only in it self, <HI>viz.</HI> in the second Principle.</P>
<P>It oft happens that the holiest Souls are in this manner overwhelmed with Sadness, and this not without Gods special permission, to the end they may be proved, and strive the more earnestly after that heavenly Crown of Victory, which is given them in this Life as a pledge of their everlasting Felicity.</P>
<P>For when the Soul takes Heaven as it were by Storm, and wins her Crown [the Gift of the holy Ghost] after a con|stant persevering stedfastness in the fiery Conflict, her Crown of triumph is much more noble and pretious then that which is not obtained till after the bodily Death; for the Revela|tion of Jesus Christ saith, <HI>To him that overcomes will I give to sit with me upon my Throne, as I have over|come, and am seated on my Father's Throne.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore let no man thus tormented with anguish, ima|gin with himself in the assaults of the Complexion, that it comes from God's wrath, and want of mercy in him, which is a meer fancy of his own Complexion in the Stars. For we well see, that the vilest fatted Swine of the Devil's herd, that wallow and bathe themselves day and night in the filth of Sin, are not so full of Sadness, not so assaulted with this kind of Temptations, the reason is because they have an out|ward light in the Complexion, wherein they dance before the Devil in an Angels likeness. So, as long as there is but one little spark of Light glimmering in a man's Heart, which desires God's Grace, and would gladly pertake of Salvation, the Door of Gods Grace stands yet open. For he who is given over by God, whose Sin is come to the full measure, he is not at all solicitous after God, Man or Devil, but is stone-blind, runs on carelesly in a course of lightness without fear, rests himself upon a customary practice of some outward
<PB N="106" REF="000447_0113_0FA5AF45791075A0">
Service of God, goes a Beast into the Sanctuary, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> again a Beast out; there is in him no true divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> but all his Religion is a meer outward Custom and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of man's Brain, which he sets up to himself as an Idol, and imbraces it as his Holiness.</P>
<P>The sorrowful Soul troubles and torments it self, because it cannot presently in the point of its desire, dig up in it self the Fountain of the greatest Joy, it sighs and bewails its sad condition, thinks God will have none of it, when it cannot palpably feel his presence; it sees other men that walk along with it in God's fear, that yet are cheer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul enough, and suppo|sing this cheerfulness of theirs proceeds only from a divine Fountain of Love and Light in their Souls&punc; is conceited that it is not accepted with God, but rather rejected by him&punc; because it doth not presently upon its Conversion, which it expected, feel in its Heart the like comfortable effects of the refreshing pre|sence of God.</P>
<P>Before the time of my enlightning it went even thus with me, I stood out a hard conflict before I obtained my precious Crown of Victory, and then did I first learn out this experimental knowledge, that God dwells not in the outward fleshly Heart, but in the Soul's centre in himself; then was I also first aware of it, that 'twas God which had laid hold on me, and drawn me to him in my first desire, which before I was ignorant of, thinking the good desire had been my own Property, and that God was indeed far from me: But afterwards I saw him, and rejoyced at the unspe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kable Grace and Love of God, and now write the same for a Caveat, that they by no means faint or dispair when the Comforter delays his coming&punc; but rather think of that of <HI>David; Heaviness may endure for a Night, but Joy cometh in the Morning.</HI></P>
<P>Have a cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain assured confidence upon Gods promise, and bowever thy mis-giving Heart say, No, yet let not this affright thee. For to believe is not to be filled with Joy in the flesh|ly Heart and outward Complexion, that the fleshly mind and spirit be so jocond, that the very Heart and Reins leap for joy; this is not Faith, but these are only some Love-emanations
<PB N="107" REF="000447_0114_0FA5AF4772D759B0">
from the holy Ghost within, a divine lightning which hath no stability, but after a short resplendance disappears. For God dwells not in the outward Heart or Complexion, but in himself, in the second centre, in the Jewel of the noble Image of God's likeness, which is hidden in this outward world.</P>
<P>Dear Soul, think no other, when the anxious property of thy Complexion, thus kindled by the Stars begins to move, but that thou then stands as a Labourer in God's Vineyard; thou must not stand idle, but b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> working; thou dost God herein a great and very considerable piece of Service, and thy la|bour is this, that thou overcome the Temptation by an unmove|able Faith, however no comfort appear in the outward Heart to support it; be not deceived, 'tis not Faith to give assent to what I see and feel; but this is Faith, to trust the hidden Spirit, and believe the truth of its words, maugre all the Contradictions of blind Nature.</P>
<P>The Soul that is lockt up in the dark Chamber of the <HI>Melancholy</HI> Complexion, should not dwell long or scarce at all in Speculations about the wrath of God, nor give it self much to, solitude, but rather spend its time in Godly Conferences. For so the matter of those friendly and profitable yielding sufficient entertainment to the working Phansie; 'tis by this means handsomly diverted from its torturing Cogitations. For no deep speculation is in this state profitable for it, which seeing it cannot turn it to its health and comfort, 'tis better let it alone.</P>
<P>Also, the <HI>Melancholy</HI> Mind should with great care avoid Drunkenness: for when the Body thus loads it self with Drink, then the earthly power of the Drink taketh the Com|plexion Chamber totally in; then doth the Soul, with the Imagination, to its great hurt, feed upon the earthly Pro|perty, kindles its Fire therewith, and rejoyceth for a short time in it.</P>
<P>But when that man becometh sober again after his Drink. then stands the poor Soul as most desolate, and more then ever forsaken of God, for it loses in the overflowing of the
<PB N="108" REF="000447_0115_0FA5AF479AAD3170">
earthly Property the divine Imagination and Desire; for the Spirit of God will not have his dwelling in the earthly Ima|gination: I speak it as a most certain truth which I have a well grounded knowledge of in the centre of Nature, and deepest Principle of Life.</P>
<P>The Soul must be content to remain in Sorrow for a little time: for while it sits contentedly in the House of Mourn|ing, it is not in the House of Sin. But alas! what is it? How soon will it be at liberty from its sorrowful Prison, and have the victorious Crown of everlasting Joy set upon its Head? O Eternity! thy duration is of vast extent! What is it for a Soul to be a small moment in sadness, and after that to rejoyce everlastingly? <HI>For God will wipe away all Tears from their Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, let a man behave himself as becomes a man, gi|ving the dominion of his Life to the manly Reason and Light of God shining therein, and not suffer himself to be hurried on by the bruitish Instincts of the Complexion: For there is no Complexion so noble and pure in Nature, but if a man live according to the Stars, the Devil hath his pleasure and pastime therein. Therefore it is rightly said by St. <HI>Peter&punc; Be sober and watchful, for the Devil your Adversary goeth about as a roaring Lyon, seeking whom he may devour.</HI></P>

<P>EVery Creature must know, that it should continue in that [condition] wherein it was created, or else it doth run on in a contrary will, and into enmity to the Will of God, and bringeth it self into pain. For a Creature which is created of darkness, hath no pain in the darkness, as a venomous Worm hath no pain in
<PB N="109" REF="000447_0116_0FA5AF49B27B4760">
its Venom; the Venom is its Life, and if it should lose its venom, and have some good thing instead thereof brought into it, and be made manifest in its Essence, this would be pain and death to it; and so also the evil is pain and death to the good.</P>
<P>Man was created of, for, and in <HI>Paradise,</HI> of, for, and in the Love of God; but if he bring himself into anger, which is as a poysonous pain and death, then that con|trary life is a pain and torment to him.</P>
<P>If the Devil had been created of the wrathful Matrix for and in Hell, and had not had the divine <HI>Ens,</HI> he could have no pain in Hell; but he being created for and in Heaven, and yet did stir up the source and pro|perty of Darkness in himself, and did bring himself to|tally into Darkness, therefore the Light is now a pain to him, <HI>viz</HI> an everlasting dispairing of God's grace and a continual enmity, being God cannot endure him in him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elf, but hath spewed him out; and therefore the Devil is angry and wrathful against his own Mo|ther, of whose Essence and Beeing he hath his original. <HI>viz.</HI> the eternal Nature, which keepeth him prisoner in his own place, as a revolter or fallen Spirit, and sup|porteth it self in him with its property of Anger and Wrath. And seeing he would not help forward the de|light of the divine Joy, therefore he must now do the contrary, and be an enemy against all Goodness.</P>
<P>For of God, and in him are all things, Darkness and Light, Love and Anger, Fire and Light, but he calleth himself God only, as to the Light of his Love.</P>
<P>There is an eternal contrariety between Darkness and Light, neither of them comprehendeth the other, and neither of them is the other, yet there is but one only Es|sence, Beeing or Substa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> wherein they subsist; but there is a difference in Quality and Will, and yet the Essence i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not divided, but a Principle maketh the division, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that the one is a nothing in the other&punc; and yet it is there</P>
<P>For the Dev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> continueth in his own dominion or pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cipality,
<PB N="110" REF="000447_0117_0FA5AF4B3AD37A90">
but not in that wherein God created him, but in the property of Wrath, in the property which be|getteth Darkness, Anguish and Pain: Indeed he is a Prince of this world, yet in the first Principle in the Kingdom of Darkness in the Pit.</P>
<P>But not in the Kingdom of the Sun, Stars and Ele|ments, he is no lord or pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce therein, but in the wrath|ful part [thereof] <HI>viz.</HI> in the root of the Evil of eve|ry thing, and yet he hath no power to do what he plea|seth with it: For there is some good in all things, which holdeth the evil captive, and shut up in the thing, there he can walk and rule only in the evil, when it stir|reth up an evil desire in it self, and bringeth its desire in|to wickedness, which the inanimate Creatures cannot do, but man can do it through the inanimate Creature, if he bring the centre of his Will with the Desire, out of the eternal centre into it, which is an Enchantment and false Magick. The will of the Devil can also enter in|to that whereinto man bringeth the desire of his Soul [which is also from the eternal] in wickedness.</P>
<P>For the original of the Soul, and of Angels, out of the Eternal is the same. But the Devil hath no power more over the time [or temporary condition] of this world, but in the great <HI>Turba</HI>; wheresoever that kind|leth it self in the eternal and&punc; natural wrath, there he is busie, as in Wars, Fighting and Strife, as also in great Tempests without Water: In the Fire he pro|ceedeth as far as the <HI>Turba</HI> goeth in great Showers, and Tempests of Thunder, Lightning, and Hail, but he cannot direct them, for he is not Lord or Master in them, but Servant.</P>
<P>Thus the Creature stirreth up, with the desire, good and evil, life and death. The human angelical Desire standeth in the centre of the eternal Nature [which is without beginning] and wherein it kindleth it self, whe|ther in good or evil, it accomplisheth its work in that.</P>
<P>Now God created every thing for, and in that,
<PB N="111" REF="000447_0118_0FA5AF4B58C8C5B8">
wherein it should be the Angels for and in Heaven, and Man for and in <HI>Paradise.</HI> If therefore the desire of the Creature go forth from its own Mother, then it en|treth into the contrary Will, and into Enmity, and it is tormented with the contrariety therein, and so a false will ariseth in a good, and thence the good will entreth into its nothing again, <HI>viz.</HI> into the end of Nature and Creature, and so leaveth the Creature in its own [evil or] wickedness, as appeared by <HI>Lucifer,</HI> and also by <HI>Adam</HI>; and had not the will of the Love of God met with him, and of meer mercy entred into the Huma|nity again, there could be no good will in man.</P>
<P>Therefore all speculation and searching about God's will is a vain thing, without the mind be converted: For when the mind standeth captivated in the self-desire of the earthly Life, it cannot comprehend [what] the will of God [is] it runneth on but in self, from one way to another, and yet findeth no rest; for self-desire evermore bringeth disquietness.</P>
<P>The Light shineth in Darkness, and the Darkness com|prehendeth not the Light, and yet they both dwell in one another. The four Elements is also an example of this, which in their original are but one Element, which is neither hot, cold, dry nor moist, and yet by its stir|ring severeth it self into four Properties, <HI>viz.</HI> into Fire, Air, Water and Earth.</P>
<P>Who would believe that Fire produceth VVater? and that the original of Fire could be in VVater, if we did not see it with our Eyes in tempests of Thundring, Light|ning and Rain: And did not find also that in living Creatures, the essential Fire in the body dwelleth in the Blood, and that the Blood is the Mother of the Fire, and the fire the Father of the Blood.</P>
<P>And as God dwelleth in the world, and filleth all things, and yet possesseth nothing: And as the fire dwelleth in the water, and yet possesseth it not: Also, as the Light dwelleth in Darkness, and yet possesseth not
<PB N="112" REF="000447_0119_0FA5AF4C28A5EA10">
the Darkness: As the Day is in the Night, and the Night in the Day, Time in Eternity, and Eternity in Time; so is man created a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cording to the outward Humanity, he is the Time, and in the Time, and the Time is the outward world, and it is also the outward man.</P>
<P>The inward man is Eternity, and the spiritual Time and VVorld; which also consisteth of Light and Dark|ness, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Love of God, as to the eternal Light, and of the Anger of God, as to the eternal Darkness, which soever of these are manifest in him, his Spirit dwelleth in that, be it Light or Darkness; for Light and Darkness are both in him.</P>
<P>Now if the Light be made manifest in the Darkness, then the Darkness loseth its darkness, and is not known or discerned. Also, on the contrary if the Darkness arise in the Light, and get the upper-hand, then the Light, and the power thereof is extinguished; this is to be considered also in man.</P>
<P>The eternal darkness of the Soul is Hell, <HI>viz.</HI> an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> king Source of anguish, which is called the <HI>anger of God:</HI> But the eternal Light in the Soul is the Kingdom of Heaven, where the fiery anguish of Darkness is turned into Joy; thus the Soul hath Heaven and Hell in it self.</P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>Tincture.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY the word <HI>Tincture</HI> is meant the power and virtue of Fire and Light; and the stirring [up or put|ting forth like a Bud] of this virtue is called the holy and pure Element [the virtue of the Sun is the Tinctu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of all things that grow in the visibility of the world; so also the Colour is the Tincture of the Ground, Christ is the Tincture of the Soul] in brief, the Tincture is the Life, and the perfluent and informing Virtue, by which any thing doth subsist; for without the Tincture that proceedeth from the Sun, Gold were no Gold: And so also the Image of God in the Soul, without the true Tin|cture [the eternal <HI>Son of Righteousness</HI>] were not the Image of God.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<PB N="113" REF="000447_0120_0FA5AF4CC73F4150">
<HEAD>Of the great <HI>Turba.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe great <HI>Turba</HI> [or <HI>Turba Magna</HI>] is the stirred and awakned wrath of the inward ground, when the foundation of Hell is made manifest in the Spirit of this world, from whence great Plagues &amp; Diseases arise; and it is also the awakned wrath of the outward Na|ture, as may be seen in great tempests of Thunder and Lightning, when the Fire is manifested [or gene|rated] in Water: In brief, it is the effusion of the anger of God, by which Nature is disturbed.</P>
<P>Often, times the Children of God have been forced to carry the Sword of the <HI>Turba</HI> in them; a great example whereof we see in <HI>Sampson,</HI> and also in <HI>Joshua</HI> with his Wars, and likewise in <HI>Abraham</HI> [and many other Pro|phets] how the zeal of God did enkindle it self in them, that they in the Spirit of Zeal have often-times awak|ned the <HI>Turba Magna</HI> in the anger of God, and raised great Rebukes, Judgments and Plagues upon whole Countries, as <HI>Moses</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> did with his Plagues upon the <HI>Egyptians.</HI></P>
<P>But we must here distinguish; if the Zeal of God should awaken it self in an holy man, without his pur|posed Will, and give him the Sword of God's Anger, such a one desires much from those who in their own thoughts contrive and plot in the wrath, and introduce the conceived or purposed Will into the Serpent's <HI>Ens,</HI> and make it to Substance, for that is Sin; yea, though the most holy man [Prophet or Apostle] should do it. Therefore Christ so empathetically, and punctually teacheth us in the new-birth. Love, Humility and Meek|ness, and would that a <HI>Christian</HI> should not at all Re|venge, also not be Angry; for he saith, <HI>Whosoever is angry with his Brother, is guilty of the Judgment.</HI> For anger is a conception in the Serpent's <HI>Ens,</HI> which must be cut off by the Judgment of God from the good beeing.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="000447_0121_0FA5AF4D899304F0">All War, howsoever blanched over, and under what pretence soever, taketh its original out of God's Anger. It doth not belong to any true <HI>Christian,</HI> born of Christ, to raise the Sword of the <HI>Turba,</HI> unless the zealous Spi|rit of God do stir it up in him, who often will rebuke Sin: whatsoever exalts its self in the wrath about its own Honour and Pride, and brings it self to Revenge [or Blood-shed] is from the Devil&mdash;Earthly Domi|nion and Government hath its original from the fall in the Serpent's craft.</P>
<P>All War and Contention doth arise out of the nature and property of the dark world, <HI>viz.</HI> from the four Elements of the Anger of God, which produceth in the Creature Pride, Covetousness, Envy and Anger; these are the four Elements of the dark world, wherein the Devils and all evil Creatures live, and from these four Elements ariseth VVar.</P>
<P>For although God bad the People of <HI>Israel</HI> drive out the <HI>Heathen,</HI> and wage VVar; yet the command was wholly from the angry zealous God, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Fire's Property; for the <HI>Heathen</HI> had stirred up the VVrath and Indignation, which would devour them. But God so far as he is called God, wills not any VVar, but the kingdom of Nature in Gods Anger willeth it.</P>

<P>MY first design here, was to be only pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">cular of <HI>Astrology:</HI> But in respect to a more general Ser|vice, I shall in the first place set down the incertainty and vanity of worldly Arts and Sciences in general, from that learned and illustrious Pen-man, <HI>Henry Corn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|lious Agrippa,</HI> Counsellor to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> of whom it is written;

uphold, that every Science addeth so much of a sublim Nature to man himself, according to the capacity and worth of every Person, as many times enables them to translate themselves beyond the limits of Humanity, even to the Caelestial Seats of the blessed. From hence have proceeded those various and innumerable <HI>Encomi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s</HI> of the Sciences, whereby every one hath endeavou|red in accurate, as well as long Orations to prefer, and as it were to extol beyond the Heavens themselves, those Arts and Mysteries wherein, with continual labour, he hath exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cised the strength and vigor of his Ingenuity or Invention. But I, perswaded by Reasons of another nature, do verily believe, that there is nothing more pernitious&punc; nothing more destructive to the well-being of men, or to the Salvation of our Souls, than the Arts &amp; Sciences themselves&mdash;all Sciences are as well evil as good, &amp; they bring no other advantage to excel as <HI>Deities,</HI> more than what the Serpent promised of Old, when he said, <HI>Ye shall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil.</HI> Let him therefore glory in this Serpent, who boasts himself in Knowledge, which we read the Heresie of the <HI>Ophites,</HI> not a little unbeseemingly to have done, who worship|ped a Serpent among the rest of their Superstitions, as being the Creature that first introduced the knowledge of Virtue into <HI>Paradise</HI>&mdash;But suppose there were no other inventors of Arts than men themselves, yet were they the Sons of the worst Generation, even the Sons of <HI>Cain,</HI> of whom it is truly said, <HI>The Sons of this World are wiser than the Sons of Light in this Generation</HI>&mdash;But if God and just men be the professors of Knowledge&punc; than Arts and Sciences may probably become useful to the publick-weal, though they render their professors no|thing more happy.

<P>NOw as it may appear by perticular instinct, so it doth appear by the Writings of this divine Philosopher, <HI>Jacob Beheme,</HI> that by <HI>Adam's</HI> fall, all his Posterity are thereby fallen under the power and influence of the Stars and Constellations, and that this beastial Body, with the <HI>Animal</HI> Spirits, are proceeded from the Stars and Elements, to which again they must return; and into the Starry and Elementary Spirit the Devil casteth forth his wicked Imaginations, to in|fect the Soul, and keep it from rising with its will above the Stars again out of his dominion, and hence is the original of the evil Influence of the Stars.</P>
<P>But in brief, this Syderial or Starry influence is called <HI>Astrology,</HI> of which many desire to be satisfied of the effects, but he is wise that knows them: For so manifold are the Con|figurations, so perpetual the Mixtures, so various the Mo|tions and Scituations of the Stars, that as they are placed at this or any other moment of time, so they never were, nor never will be again, whence their operation upon Mankind is the same: So that 'tis impossible for an <HI>Astrologer,</HI> by the Rules of Art [though founded upon the truest ground] to give any certain Judgment of their Effects, but only in a general way.</P>
<P>But of <HI>Astrology</HI> in a more per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">lar manner, I may well say something [especially of the Genith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cal part there+of] inasmuch as the desire of the fore-knowledge of my own Fate or Distiny hath caused me to be well acquainted there+with: For having by the best approved Rules of Art calcu+lated and rectified my own Nativity [with the Nativities o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> many others too] directed the several Significators to thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> respective Promittors, made use of Revolutions, Transit&punc; Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ections, and what not: being thereby able [by Rules <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Art] to fore-know and predict both good and evil Accident and whatsoever is contingent to the Life of man.

<P>But that which might non plus the most accute Inquisitor in referrence hereto, was, that after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rue moment of Birth gained, I found the Rules and Aphorisms of the Art to fail&punc; much in the general Judgment of the twelve Houses; as instance; When Judgment hath been given by me and others of the Ascendent [or other of the Houses] of one and the same Scheam of Shape, Form, Complexion, and the like, time hath often manifested the Judgment for the most part false. Considering all this, caused me to suspect the truth of the Art, and had very little esteem or love for it: But my In|clinations being prone thereto, I fell to examining the ground and foundation on which the Rules and Axioms of the Art were laid, and coming to the four Elements, which answers to the four Triplicities of the Signs, I perceived a vast diffe|rence in judgment among Philosophers, about the nature of the Element of Air; for although the Antients, and from them our modern Astrologers, determin the Air to be hot and moist, and so &Gemini;, &Libra; and &Aquar; being Signs of the Airy Tripli|city, are so too; yet that accute Philosopher <HI>Van Helmont,</HI> notably proves the Air to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cold. Here <HI>Reader,</HI> thou mayst reconcile this opposit Judgment of these wise men, if thou canst, for from hence &Gemini;&punc; &Libra;, &Aquar; must be cold, which
<PB N="122" REF="000447_0129_0FA5AF57DFAFC548">
nevertheless pass in the Practise of Astrology for hot.</P>
<P>Next, I con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dered the twelve Constellations or Signs of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ak,</HI> and finding eac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sign to be made up by a certain numbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Stars which Stars, though fixed in respect to the distance from each other, yet they in general have such a motion as moves them a Degree in about <HI>70</HI> Years [as I remember] by means of which motion the Signs consequently are much altered from what they were in the time o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the An|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ients, and yet Astrologers in this Age retain the same limits, for the beginning and end of each Sign, as the Antients <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id, for they now begin the Sign &Aries; at the Vernal <HI>Equinox</HI>&punc; though 'tis apparent to all Astronomers, that the Sign &Aries;, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Ram,</HI> is removed near the length of a whole Sign from the said <HI>Equinox,</HI> and the Sign <HI>Pisses,</HI> viz. the Constellation of the <HI>Fishes</HI> is got into the place of the <HI>Ram</HI> [or limits of &Aries; aforesaid.] Now &Aries; <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Ram</HI> is termed hot and dry&punc; <HI>Cholerick Masculin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and <HI>Pisces</HI> the <HI>Fishes</HI> cold and moist, <HI>Flegmatick Feminine</HI> [two opposit Qualities] hence that place in the Heavens limitted for the Sign &Aries;, must be cold and moist, because the <HI>Fishes,</HI> from whence the said li|mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> assumes its Nature, is got into the limits of the Sign &Aries;, and yet Astrologers following Tradition, or something else as bad, call it hot and dry; the like is to be understood of others of the Signs: Here I began to perceive the cause of the manifold Errors of Astrologers.</P>
<P><HI>But while I was searching learned Authors, to find whence this Art did arise, I found</HI> Cornelius Agrippa <HI>[in his Vanity of Sciences, before mentioned] to assert that the twelve Signs, with the Northern and Southern Constellations got all into the Heavens by the help of Fables and Fictions, invented by the</HI> Poets; <HI>wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch asser|tion of</HI> Agrippa, <HI>because I cannot disprove, I will now leave&punc; and come next to the Table of essential Digni|ties of the Planets, invented ['tis said] by</HI> Ptolomy, <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng of</HI> Egypt, <HI>and acknowledged for rational by our</HI> English <HI>Astrologers; he there places the Planet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the watry Triplicity, and therein he is allowed three
<PB N="123" REF="000447_0130_0FA5AF58043B8EA0">
essential Dignities more then he hath in any other Tri|plicity, and yet I know no reason for it; for Reason tells me, that &Mars; is m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e essentially strong in fiery Signs, as being agreeable to his own Nature&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther perticulars I could instance of this Table, as being groundless; but let these motions stir up the more Judicious to a further search and consideration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No 'tis very probable that hence might arise those frivolous Inventions of consulting the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igure of Con|ception with Revolutions, Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons,</HI> &amp;c <HI>which have no rational Foundation; for finding their Judgment fail, they fell to inventing those diversities of D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctrines and Methods, which instead of clearing and confirming the Rules of Art, did more cloud and obscure the same.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For as to that highly esteemed Doctrine of</HI> Revolu|tions, <HI>if considered in its right ground, will be found of no validity or certainty, as I could experimentally prove; and as for</HI> Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ections <HI>there is so little shew of Reason for it, that 'tis not worth mentioning.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then again, there are some things that does even confound</HI> Astrology, <HI>and overthrow the Rules thereof&punc; one of which is, in Wars or other Accidents, there some|times perishes thousands of People in one day. Now from the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e peoples Nativities, we might find by rules of Art some to dye natural death, some violent, some after one manner&punc; and some after another, some by one Distemper or Disease, and some by another, some to be long lived, and some short, some to dye in one Year&punc; and some in another, yet nevertheless they all come to an end in one day: Another is, by the burning of a City, or the like, many Persons are ruined, as to out|ward Estates in a moment, when if we examin their Na|tivites, we should find some of them to be promised in|crease of Wealth that Year by one means, and some by other means, some to suffer loss one way, and some another, and some it may be neither to lose nor gain, and yet all in one instant pertake of one and the same Fortune.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="000447_0131_0FA5AF58C713B4E0"><HI>Much I could instance of this nature in</HI> Astrology, <HI>but my intent at first was only to hint in short, that others more deeply affected may make a more diligent inquisi|tion, if they please.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yet notwithstanding all this [through the affection I have had for this Art of</HI> Astrology] <HI>I am not willing to be numbred among the Revilers thereof, nor do I think it to be more unlawful or false in it self then other Arts, but do believe it is as yet unknown, and that there is none that practise it, who rightly understand it, the Rules being partly founded upon a false and uncertain ground, as is before demonstrated.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But now since it is so difficult a Road to travel in, and no end of the Journey to be yet found, so hard a work to labour in, and no profit doth thereby acrew: And that the best use we can make of it, brings no ad|vantage to us, neither in divine nor human things&punc; therefore I'll take leave to wave it; And</HI></P>
<L>Let them whose Brains are sick of that Disease,</L>
<L>Be Slaves unto an <HI>Ephemerides;</HI></L>
<L>Search&punc; Constellations, and themselves apply</L>
<L>To find the Fate of their Nativity.</L>
<L>I'll seek within me, and if there I find</L>
<L>Those Stars that should give Light unto my mind&punc;</L>
<L>Rise fair and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">imely in me, and affect</L>

<L>I fear no Fortunes whatsoever they be,</L>

<P>Secondly, To let the Publisher hereof have Chri|stian censures from thee; and that too in respect to the latter part, the which although it may seem somewhat too light in the Ballance of the more serious modern Christian, yet he intends it not to be a means to draw the mind from better, but ra|ther from worse things: And he doubts not but that will be the effects of it, considering the Constitution of Youth, on whom it may have most influence; all which he hopes thou wilt find ground enough to believe in the perusal hereof: And the rather be|cause as he hath endeavoured throughout to pass by particular Circumstances, the more immediately to come to the Matter. So also hath he every where omitted what seems more Airy, and less consisting with the present time of Day.</P>

<L>FIrst, Love, the same I here the first do call,</L>
<L>Because that Passion is most naturall,</L>
<L>And of it self could not be discommended,</L>
<L>VVert not with many a foul Abuse attended:</L>
<L>God taught it sweetly how to move the mind,</L>
<L>Both for increasing, and preserving Kind.</L>
<L>But now the bound it had, contenteth not,</L>
<L>A Vein of domineering it hath got,</L>
<L>Makes them set light by Reason's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound direction,</L>
<L>And bears them head-long by untamed affection;</L>
<L>Counsel's in vain, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cause when this fit doth take them,</L>
<L>Reason and Understanding doth forsake them:</L>

<L>VVe scarce dare give it now the name of Love.</L>
<L>True worth moves few: but sure I am, not many</L>

<L>VVealth wins the most, yet they by tryal prove,</L>

<HEAD>I. Of <HI>DEATH.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MEn fear Death, as Children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural Fear in Children is increased with Tales, so is the other. Certainly, the fear of Death, is Contemplation of the cause of it, yet the fear of it for it self, is weak. You shall read in some of the Fryers Books, of Mortification, That a man should think with himself, what the the pain is, if he have but his Fingers end pressed or tortured, and thereby imagin what the pains of Death are, when the whole Body is corrupted and dissolved; when many times Death passeth wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h less pain, then the torture of a Limb. For the most Vital parts, are not the quickest of sence. Grones and Convulsions, and a discoloured Face, and Friends weeping and Blacks, and Obsequies and the like, shew Death terrible. It is worthy the ob|serving, that there is no Passion in the mind of Man so weak, but masters the Fear of Death; and therefore Death is no such Enemy, when a man hath so many Fol|lowers about him, that can win the combat of him. Revenge triumphs over Death; Love esteems it not; Honour aspireth to it; delivery from Ignominy, chu|seth it; Grief flyeth to it; Fear pre-occupateth it. It is no less worthy to observe, how little alteration in good Spirits the approaches of Death make: but they are the same till the last. It is as natural to dye, as to be born, and to a little Infant, perhaps the one is as pain|ful as the other.</P>

But the most ordinary cause of a single Life, is Liberty, e|specially in certain Self-pleasing and humorous Minds, which are so sensible of every Restriction, as they will go near to think their Girdles and Garters to be Bands and Shackles.

and Hard-hearted; good to make severe Inquisitors. Grave Natures led by Custom, and therefore constant, are commonly loving Husbands.

<P>THe Joys of Parents are secret, and so are their Griefs and Fears: they cannot utter the one, nor will they utter the other.

They that are the first raisers of their House, are most indulgent towards their Children, be|holding them as the continuance, not only of their Kind but of their VVork; and so both Children and Creatures. The difference of Affection in Parents&punc;

<HEAD><HI>VII.</HI> Of <HI>Counsel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe greatest Trust between man, is the Trust of giving Counsel. For in other Confidences, men commit the parts of their Life, their Lands, their Goods, their Child, their Credit, some particular Affair. But to such as they make their Counsellors, they commit the whole; by how much the more they are obliged to all Faith and Integrity. The wisest Princes need not think it any deminution to their Greatness, or derogation to their Sufficiency to relie on Counsel. God himself is not without, but hath made it one of the great Names of his blessed Son. The Counsellor <HI>Solomon</HI> hath pronounced&punc; <HI>That in Counsel there is safety</HI>&middot; Things will have their first or second Cogitations: If they be not tossed upon the Arguments of Counsel, they will be tossed upon the Waves of Fortune, and be full of Inconstan|cy, doing and undoing, like the reeling of a drunken man. <HI>Solomon's</HI> Son found the force of Counsel, as his Father found the necessity of it. For the beloved Kingdom of God was first rent and broken by ill Counsel: Vpon which Coun|sel there are set for our Instruction, the two marks, whereby had Counsel is forever best discerned, that is, young Coun|sel for the Persons, and violent Counsel for the Matter. There is, that are in their Natures faithful, and sincere, and plain, and direct, not crafty and invalued: Let Princes above all, draw to themselves such Natures. The true composition of a Counsellor is to be rather skilful in his Masters business, then in his Nature; for then he is like to advise him, and not to feed his Humour. It is of singular use to Princes, if they take the opinion of their Council, both seperately, and together; for private Opinion is more free, but Opinion before others, is more reverent. In private, men are more bold in their own Humours; and in Consort, men are more Obnoxious to others Humours. Therefore it is good to take both; and of the inferior sort rather in private, to preserve Freedom: Of the greater, rather in Consort, to preserve

<P>IT cannot be denyed, but outward Accidents conduce much to a man's Fortune, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avour oppertune Death of others occasion, fitting Virtue; but chiefly the mould of a man's Fortune is in himself. And the most frequent of external Causes, is that the Folly of one man is the Fortune of another; for no man prospers so suddainly as by others Errors. If a man look sharply and accen|tively, he shall see Fortune; for though she be blind, yet she is not invisible. Certainly, there be not two more fortunate Porperties, then to have a little of the Fool&punc; and not too much of the Honest. Therefore ex|tream lovers of their Country or Masters, were never fortunate, neither can they be. For when a man placeth his Thoughts without himself, he goeth not his own way. All wise men, to decline the envy of their own Virtues, use to ascribe them to Providence and Fortune, for so they may the better assume them. And besides, it is greatness in a man, to be the care of the higher Powers&mdash;The Poet speaks of Fortune thus,

<HEAD>XX. Of <HI>Studies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>STudies serve for Delight, for Ornament, and for Ability; their chief use for delight, is in private|ness and retiring: for Ornament, is in Discourse: and for Ability, is in Judgment. For expert men can exe+cute men, but learned men are fittest to judge and cen|sure. To spend too much time in them, is sloath; to use them too much for Ornament, is affectation. To make judgment wholly by their Rules, is the humour of a Schollar: They perfect Nature, and are perfected by Experience. Crafty men contemn them, simple men admire them, and wise men use them. For they teach not their own use, but that it is a Wisdom with|out them, and above them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on by observation. Read not to contradict, nor to believe, but to weigh and consider. Some Books are to be tasted, and others to be swallowed. Reading makes a full man, Confer|rence a ready man, and Writing an exact man: And therefore if a man Write little, he had need have a great Memory; if he confer little, he had need have a present Wit; &amp; if he read little, he had need have much Cunning, to know that he doth not.

<P>HE that is only real, had need have exceeding great parts of Virtue. To attain good Forms, it suf|ficeth not to despise them, for so shall a man observe them in others; and let him trust himself with the rest. For if he care to express them, he shall lose their grace; which is to be natural and unaffected. Not to use Ceremonies at all, is to teach others not to use them again, and so diminisheth Respect; especially they be not to be omitted to Strangers, and formal Natures. Amongst a man's Peers, a man shall be sure of Familia|rity; and therefore it is good a little to keep state. Amongst a man's Inferiors one shall be sure of Reve|rence, and therefore it is good a little to be familiar.

<HEAD>XXIII. Of <HI>Negotiating.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is generally better to deal by Speech, then by Letter, and by the mediation of a third, then by a man's self; Letters are good when a man would draw an An|swer by Letters back again, or when it may serve for a man's Justification, afterwards to produce his own Let|ter, or where it may be danger to be interrupted, or heard by pieces. To deal in Person is good, when a mans Face breeds regard; as commonly with Inferiors, or in tender cases, where a mans Eye, upon the Counte|nance of him with whom one speaketh, may give him a direction how far to go; and generally, where a man will reserve to himself Liberty, either to disavow or to expound. It is better to sound a Person with whom one deal afar off, then to fall upon the Point at first, except you mean to surprise him by some short Question. It is better dealing with men in Appetite, then with those which are where they would be. In choice of Instru|ments [for dealing] it is better to chuse men of plainer sort that are like to do that that is committed to them, and to report back again faithfully the Success, then those that are cunning, to contrive out of other mens Business somewhat to grace themselves, and will help the matter in Report for satisfaction sake. All Pra|ctice is to discover, or to work. Men discover them|selves in Trust, in Passion, at unawares and of necessity when they would have somewhat done, and cannot find

If you would work any man, you must either know his Manner and Fashions, and so lead him or his ends, and so perswade him or his weakness, or disadvantage, and so awe him, and so govern them. In dealing with cunning Persons, we must ever consider their Ends, to interpret their Speeches; and it is good to say little to them, and that which they least look for.</P>

<P>JUdges ought to remember that their Office is to inter|pret Law, and not to make Law, or give Law, else will it be like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> presumption of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which under pretext of Exposition of Scripture, usurpeth and practiseth an Anthority to add and alter, and to pronounce that which they do not find, and by colour of Antiquity to introduce novelty. Judges ought to be more learned, then witty, more reverend then plausible, and more advised then confident. Above all things, Inte|grity is their portion and proper Virtue. <HI>Cursed</HI> [saith the Law] <HI>is he that removeth the Land-marks.</HI> The mis|layer of a Meerstone is to blame; but it is the unjust Judge that is the capital remover of Land-marks, when he defineth a miss of Lands and Property. One foul sentenced doth more hurt then many foul Examples, for they do but corrupt the Stream; the other corrupteth the Fountains. <HI>There be</HI> [saith the Scripture] <HI>that turn Judgment into Wormwood</HI>; and surely there be also, that turn it into Vinegar: for Injustice maketh it bitter, and Delayes maketh it sower. The principal duty of a Judge is to suppress Force and Fraud, whereof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orce is the more pernitious, the more open and Fraud the more close and disguised. Add thereto contentious Suits, which ought to be spued out as the surfeit of Courts. A Judge ought to prepare his way to a just Sentence, as God useth to prepare his way by raising
<PB N="71" REF="000447_0206_0FA5B05C474A2A48">
Valleys, and taking down Hills: So when there appear|eth on either side an high Hand, violent Prosecution, cunning Advantages taken, combination Power, great Counsel, then is the Virtue of a Judge seen to make Ine|quality equal, that he may plant his Judgment upon an even Ground. Judges must beware of hard Constru|ctions and stained Inferrences; for there is no worse to turn then the torture of Laws, specially in cases of Laws penal; they ought to have a care, that that which was meant for Terror be not turned into Rigor; and that they bring not upon the People that Shower, whereof the Scripture speaketh: <HI>Piuet Super eos laqueo</HI>; For penal Laws pressed are as a shower of Snares upon the People. In cases of Life and Death, Judges ought [as far as the Law permitteth] in Justice to remember Mercy&punc; and to cast a severe Eye upon the Example, but a mer|ciful Eye upon the Person.</P>
<P><HI>Patience and Gravity of hearing, is an essential part of Justice; and an over-speaking Judge is no well tuned Cimbal. It is no grace to a Judge to find that which he might have heard in due time from the Bar, or to shew quickness of Conceit in cutting off Counsel or Evidences too short, or to prevent Information by Questions, though pertinent. The parts of a Judge are four; To direct the Evidence, to mo|derate length of Repetition, or impertinency of Speech; to Recapitulate and Collate the material Points of that which hath been said, and to give the Rule and Sentence: What|soever is above these, is too much, and proceedeth either of Glory, and willingness to speak, or of Impatience to hear, or of shortness of Memory, or of want of a staid and equal in|tention. It is a strange thing to see that the boldness of Advo|cates should prevail with Judges, whereas they should imitate God, in whose Seat they sit; who represseth the Presumptions&punc; and giveth Grace to the Modest. But is more strange, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Custome of the Time doth warrant Judges to have noted Favourites, which cannot but cause multiplication of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; and suspition of By-wayes.

On the other side, an antient Clerk, skilful in Presidents, wary in proceeding and understanding in the business of the Court, is an excellent Finger of a Court, and doth many times point out the way of the Judge himself.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly, Judges ought above all, to remember the Conclusion of the</HI> Roman <HI>twelve Tables</HI>; Salus populi Supreama lex; <HI>and to know that Laws, except they be in order to that end, are but things Captious, and Oracles not well inspired.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And let no man weakly conceive, that just Laws and true Pollicy have any antipathy. For they are like the Spirits and Sinnews that one moves within the other.

<Q>I demand Mercy, and not Sacrifice.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALl the boasting of the Hypocrite is of the Works of the first Table of the Law, which is of adoration &amp; duty towards God; whereof the Reason is double, both because such Works have a greater pomp and demonstration of Holiness, and also because they do less cross their Affections &amp; Desires, there|fore the way to cenvict Hypocrites, is to send them from the works of Sacrifice to the works of Mercy, whence cometh that saying, <HI>This is the pure and immaculate Religion with God the Father, to visit Orphans and VViddows in their Tribulations;</HI> and that saying, <HI>He that loveth not his Brother, whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he hath not seen.</HI></P>
<P>Now there is another kind of deeper and more extravagant Hypocrisie; for some deceiving themselves, and thinking them|selves worthy of a more near access and conversation with God, do neglect the duties of Charity towards their Neigh|bour, as inferiour Matters, which did not indeed cause ori|ginally the beginning of a monastical Life [for the begin|nings were good] but brought in that Excess and abuse which are followed after: For it is truly said, That the office of Praying is a great Office in the Church. And it is for the good of the Church that there be Consorts of men freed from the Cares of this World, who may with daily and

devout Supplications and Observances, solicite the divine Majesty for the causes of the Church. But unto this Or|dinance, that other Hypocrisie is a nigh Neighbour, neither is the general Institution to be blamed, but those Spirits which exalt themselves too high to be refrained.</P>
<P>As to those others, who are so officious towards God, to them belongeth that Question: If thou dost justly, what is that to God? or what profit doth he take by thy Hands? Where|fore the Works of Mercy are the Works of distinction, where|by to find out Hypocrites. But with Hereticks it is contrary, for as Hypocrites with their dissemling Holiness towards God do paliate and cover their Injuries towards men; so Hereticks by their Morallity and honest carriage towards men, insinuate and make away with their Blasphemies against God.</P>

<P>THis is the true Image, and true temper of a man and of him that is God's faithful work man, his car|riage and conversation towards God is full of Passion, of Zeal and of Transmises, thence proceed Groans un|speakable, and Exultings, likewise in comfort, ravish|ment of Spirit, and Agonies.

<P>THere are three forms of speaking, which are as it were the stile and phrase of Impostors; the first kind is of them, who, as soon as they have gotten any sub|ject or matter, do strait cast it into an Art, inventing new terms of Art, reducing all into Divisions and Di|stractions, thence draweth Assertions or Oppositions, and so framing Oppositions by Questions and Answers: Hence issueth the Cop-webs and Clatterings of the School-men.</P>
<P>The second kind is of them, who out of the vanity of their wit [as Church-Poets] do make and advise all varieties of Tales, Stories and Examples, whereby they may lead mens minds to a belief; from whence did grow the Legends, and infinit fabulous Inventions and Dreams of the antient Hereticks.</P>

them. Certainly, a little Philosophy inclineth man's mind to Atheism, but depth in Philosophy bringeth men about to Religion. For when the mind of man looketh upon second Causes scattered, sometimes it resteth in them; but when it beholdeth them confederate and knit together, it flyes to Providence and Deity. For it is a thousand times more credible, that four Elements and one immutable fifth Essence, duly and eternally placed need no God, then that an Army of an infinite small Porti|ons or Seeds unplaced, should have produced this order &amp; Beauty without a divine Marshal. The Scripture saith, <HI>The Fool hath said in his Heart, There is no God:</HI> It is not said, the Fool hath thought in his Heart. So as he rather saith it by roat to himself, as that he would have, then that he can throughly believe it, or to be perswa|ded of it. For none deny there is a God, but those for whom it maketh that there were no God: But in vain doth he strive utterly to alienate or put out that sparkle of our Creation-Light, whereby men acknowledge a Deity, burning still within&mdash;Again, whoso laboureth earnestly to prove an Opinion to another, himself di|strust it?</P>

So that against <HI>Atheists</HI> the most barbarous Savages take part with the subtillest Phylosophers. They that deny a God, destroy man's Nobility: For certainly Man is of kin to the Beast by his Body; and if he be not of kin to God by his Spirit, he is a base and ignoble Creature. It destroys likewise Magnaminity, and the raising of human Nature: For take an example of a Dog, and mark what a generosity and courage he will put on when he finds himself maintained by a man, which to him is instead of a God, or <HI>Melior Natura</HI>; which cor+rage

is manifestly such, as that Creature without that confidence of a better Nature than his own could never attain. So man when he resteth and assureth himself upon divine Protection and Favour, gathereth force and faith, which human Nature in it self could not ob|tain. Therefore as <HI>Atheism</HI> is in all respects hateful&punc; so in this, that it depriveth human Nature of the means to exalt it self above human Frailty. Lastly, <HI>Atheism</HI> seems every way to be joyned and combined with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olly and Ignorance, seeing nothing can be more justly allot|ted to the saying of Fools, then this, <HI>There is no God.</HI></P>

<P>IT were better to have no Opinion of God at all, then such an Opinion as is unworthy of him; for the one is Unbelief, the other is Contumely: And certainly, <HI>Superstition</HI> is the reproach of Deity. <HI>Atheism</HI> leaves a man to Sense, to Phylosophy, to natural Piety, to Laws, to Reputation, all which may be guides to Virtue, though Religion were not; but <HI>Superstition</HI> di mounts all these, and erecteth an absolute Tyranny in the mind of men.

<P>A Life free from the Intermixture of Discontent is aimed at by all, but impossible to be obtained by any; for Nature hath so ordained it, that care, trouble and molestation is interwoven with the web of our life; so that as our more gross part, the body, is burthened with labour and toil, so our more spiritual part, the mind, is disquieted with discontented Imaginations; nor indeed can we tell how to relish Virtue, unless we first taste of Discontent; for the Clouds of sorrow being over-blown (like rest after labour) the fruit of Felicity is much more delightful and pleasing.
