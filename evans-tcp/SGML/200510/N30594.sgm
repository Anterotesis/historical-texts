<HEAD>A few Words concerning that pi|ous Youth, of worthy Memory, <HI>to wit, THOMAS SCATTERGOOD,</HI>
<DATE>Jun. who departed this Life the <HI>19th</HI> of <HI>Fir&s;t Month, 1731,</HI> in the <HI>26</HI>th Year of his Age.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IT being my Lot to be pretty much with him in the Time of his Illne&s;s, which he bore with Patience, to Admiration; his Di&s;temper being a <HI>Stoppage in his Stomach or Breath,</HI> he was &s;ometimes almo&s;t &s;trangled; yet, when he could &s;peak, his Words, though few, were &s;avory: Many Times Praying to the Lord with a compo&s;ed Mind, when in great Extremity of Body. I have of|ten

thought it great Encourage|ment for People to endeavour to dwell near the Lord, when we &s;ee how he beareth up &s;uch as &s;incerely tru&s;t in him: As we have Cau&s;e to believe this Youth did. For he would call upon the Lord with a chearful Counte|nance, and with &s;uch Hope and Confidence, as if he no Ways que&s;tioned the Lord's Mercy to him; and would often drop &s;weet Doctrine among &s;uch as came to &s;ee him, for their Encourage|ment; often Praying to the Lord, not only for him&s;elf, but for the Family, and his Friends and Neighbours. O the many &s;weet Prayers that I have heard him put up unto the Lord, that he <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> plea&s;ed to give him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> near what his holy Mind and Will was to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> upon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">im.</HI>

Adding: <HI>O thou pure Fountain! that never can be drawn dry, &s;weet|en my Soul a little, and &s;trengthen my inward Man</HI>; with many more precious Sayings: Often &s;ay|ing; <HI>O Lord! rai&s;e up many Thou|&s;ands, from the</HI> Ea&s;t, <HI>from the</HI> We&s;t, <HI>from the</HI> North, <HI>and from the</HI> South; <HI>that they may be faith|ful Mini&s;ters unto thee, that &s;o thy Ble&s;&s;ed Truth may grow and pro&s;per in the Earth.</HI> Thus was the Concern of this virtuous Young Man, in the Time of his Illne&s;s, as it had been in his Health. He was a diligent Fre|quenter of Friends Meetings, when well; and &s;ometimes he had a Concern upon him to bear a Pub|lick Te&s;timony for the Truth; which I believe he was faithful to, and retained his Integrity to the End. O that the Youth of our Age
<PB N="4" REF="040609_0004_10165301D9DD6DF0">
would take him (and &s;uch as he was) for an Example. His De|portment &s;uited his Clothes, plain; and his Words were &s;ea&s;oned with Grace.</P>
<P>And he would often &s;ay: <HI>O that our young People would but give up their Days to &s;erve the Lord! How would he adorn them!</HI> Often directing them to that <HI>Ble&s;|&s;ed Guide,</HI> meaning the <HI>Spirit of Truth.</HI> He him&s;elf was wonder|fully adorned with that inward Adorning of a <HI>meek and a quiet Spirit, which is with the Lord of great Price.</HI></P>
<P>I write the&s;e few Lines, chief|ly to ea&s;e my own Mind concern|ing One for the Lo&s;s of whom my Spirit mourns in &s;ecret: Having often been comforted with what dropt from his Mouth; the Pow|er which attended his Words be|ing
<PB N="5" REF="040609_0005_10165303C6157308">
to my needy Soul as the Oil of the good <HI>Samaritan</HI> to the wounded Man. But the Lord a|lone is able to make up the Lo&s;s, and rai&s;e up many more faithful Mini&s;ters, as was the fervent Prayer of this Young Man.</P>
<P>I never perceived that the Thoughts of Death were any Sur|prize to him: But &s;ometimes, when he thought he was near his End, he would be very earne&s;t with the Lord, that <HI>he would give him Patience to bear his Af|fliction of Body, that he might not di&s;honour his Holy Name.</HI></P>
<P>I do not remember that I ever heard him &s;peak a murmuring Word, though his Di&s;temper was hard to bear for a long Time; only I have heard him &s;ay, <HI>O Lord! What have I done? What have I done, that thou art plea&s;ed thus to try me?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="040609_0006_1016530763D6B2A8">I have admired to &s;ee the Goodne&s;s of the Lord to him, and how he fed his Soul with Food convenient and &s;uitable to the Day: For he would &s;ing Prai&s;es to the Lord, when he could hard|ly &s;peak, his Pain of Body was &s;o great: Which hath made my Soul to rejoice, altho', at the &s;ame Time, my Heart hath been pain|ed within me, to &s;ee the Afflicti|on of his Body. But after a long Time, and many Means u&s;ed, he &s;eemed &s;omewhat to recover, which gave us great Hopes the Lord would have &s;pared him with us longer; he being a Pattern of Piety, Meekne&s;s, and Plainne&s;s; and &s;eemed as if he might have been of great Service among our young People. But his Di&s;tem|per &s;eizing him &s;harply again, put
<PB N="7" REF="040609_0007_1016530BE994BEB0">
a Period to his natural Life in a little Time, and &s;et his Soul at Liberty from the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Body. And I am well &s;atisfied the Lord hath taken him to Him&s;elf, to live with Him forever.</P>
<P>I was not with him in his la&s;t Moments: But a Per&s;on who was with him at that Time &s;ignified to me: "That the Night before he departed, he was in a &s;weet Frame of Spirit; and a few Mi|nutes before he left the World, he was heard to &s;ay, <HI>How glori|ous is thy powerful Pre&s;ence, O Lord!</HI> And the la&s;t that he was heard to &s;peak, was, <HI>Into thy Hands, O Lord, do I commit my Soul!</HI>"</P>
<P>Having been much with him, and &s;eeing his Zeal, Courage and Con&s;tancy, I could do no le&s;s than make the&s;e Remarks thereof to
<PB N="8" REF="040609_0008_1016530E694E9D90">
his Memory. And conclude with De&s;ires that we who have enjoyed &s;o many of the Lord's Mercies, may prize them as we ought to do.</P>
<P><HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead that die in the Lord, from henceforth; yea, &s;aith the Spirit, that they may re&s;t from their Labours, and their Works do follow them,</HI> Rev. iv.13.</P>
<P>Written by One who hath been made a Sharer of the good Coun|&s;el which the Lord enabled him to drop among his Relations and Friends, for their Edification and In&s;truction; Part of which I took to my&s;elf, and trea&s;ured it up in my Mind.</P>
