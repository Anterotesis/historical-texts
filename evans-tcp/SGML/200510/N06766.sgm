<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD, <HI>and</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will be &s;urpri&s;ed at an Addre&s;s made to you jointly in this Manner; but as I have not the Honour to be much acquainted with ei|ther of you, though I e&s;teem you both, (at lea&s;t while you remain connected) I hope you will for|give me for troubling you, in this public Way; and the rather, as I think the Matters I &s;hall write upon, to be of very great Importance; and as you will di&s;cover by what I am going to &s;ugge&s;t to you, that I am a true Friend to Old <HI>England,</HI> and a &s;incere Lover of my Country.</P>
<P>I have long thought that our <HI>Mini&s;ters of State</HI> may be much a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in their Deliberations, by Per&s;ons who have not the Honour of &s;itting at the Council Board. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wi&s;e&s;t Mea&s;ures have often

The Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inction of factious Oppo&s;ition, the Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nimity of every Party, and the Acquie&s;|cence of every Connection, in whatever Scheme is propo&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty's Servants, while it hath produced infinite Advantages to the Public, hath deprived tho&s;e who direct the Cabinet, of all &s;uch Parliamentary In&s;truction, as their Predece&s;&s;ors in Power u&s;ed to receive. You, my Lord, of late, &s;carcely hear any Speech in the Hou&s;e of Lords, but that of a Lawyer on a <HI>Scotch</HI> Appeal; and the hereditary Council of the Nation rarely a&s;&s;emble for higher Purpo&s;es than to alter <HI>Settlements</HI> and de|liberate on Bills of <HI>Divorce.</HI> And you, Sir, in the other Hou&s;e, where &s;o many &s;kilful Champions u&s;ed formerly to engage and &s;truggle for Victory, remain &s;ingle in the Field of Battle; and your Speaker takes the Chair only to vote <HI>Millions</HI> and levy Thou&s;ands, without the lea&s;t Debate or Op|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Channel of Parliamentary In&s;truction being thus &s;topt, no other but that of the Pre&s;s is left open, for tho&s;e Heads of Advice to which it may be worth your While to attend. For this Rea&s;on it is, that I have thought of addre&s;&s;ing you in this Manner. Who I am, it matters not. Let it &s;uf|fice, that, unpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ioned and unemployed, I can vie, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Zeal for the Public, with tho&s;e who ta&s;te the Sw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ets of exorbitant Salaries, and unfathomed Per|qui&s;ites.

be determined by you, and by the Public. This I am certain of, that my Intention is hone&s;t; and while I plea&s;e my&s;elf, I &s;hall endeavour, at the &s;ame Time, not to offend either of you. Some Produc|tions, in which you have, of late, been jointly taken Notice of, proceeded from a <HI>fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tious</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition, which I am unacquainted with, and dete&s;t. For, far from wi&s;hing to di&s;unite and &s;eparate your In|tere&s;ts, I am fully per&s;uaded that without your per|fect Harmony and Union, the great Events which have happened under your Admini&s;tration, will not have tho&s;e permanent good Con&s;equences &s;o much to be wi&s;hed for: And it is only from your joint Concurrence, that we can hope for any of tho&s;e prudent, &s;pirited and national Mea&s;ures con|cerning which I propo&s;e to offer you a few Hints, in this Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Condition of <HI>France,</HI> fallen from its alarming Power, and Great|ne&s;s, into the lowe&s;t State of Di&s;tre&s;s and Impotence; unfortunate in its military Operations in every Quar|ter of the Globe&punc; beaten all <HI>Europe</HI> over by Sea and Land; its Fleets &s;ailing, only to be de&s;troyed; its Armies marching, only to run away; without Trade; no Credit; &s;topping Payments, prote&s;ting Bills, and to all Intents and Purpo&s;es a Bankrupt Nation; their King, the Princes of the Blood, the Nobility, and the Clergy carrying in all their Plate to be coined, for the pre&s;ent extreme Exigency of their Affairs; di&s;appointed and baff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in all their Schemes on the Continent, and taught to think no more of <HI>Inva&s;ions,</HI> by the De&s;truction of the only Fleet they had left;&mdash;I &s;ay, con&s;idering all the&s;e Circum&s;tances, which I have not exaggerated, in the lea&s;t, it is not unnatural to imagine, that a Period will &s;oon be put to the Troubles of <HI>Eu|rope.

&s;oon be reduced to the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uing for Peace.</P>
<P>We have had Blood&s;hed enough. God forgive tho&s;e who have occa&s;ioned this terrible De&s;truction of the human Species, and &s;pread Mi&s;ery, and De|va&s;tation, for &s;o long a Time, in almo&s;t every Corner of the Globe. The great Succe&s;s with which the Arms of <HI>Britain</HI> have been ble&s;&s;ed, puts it in our Power to give Peace to <HI>Europe:</HI> and it is to the Honour of his Maje&s;ty and tho&s;e who di|rect his Councils, that the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our Ene|mies have only enabled him to give the World a Proof of his Moderation; and to &s;hew that his In|clination to make Peace, keeps Pace with the Ina|bility of <HI>France</HI> to prolong the War.</P>
<P><Q>As his Maje&s;ty entered into this War, not from Views of Ambition, &s;o he does not Wi&s;h to continue it, from Motives of Re&s;entment. The De&s;ire of his Maje&s;ty's Heart is, to &s;ee a Stop put to the Effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian Blood.</Q></P>
<P>What was declared in the above Paragraph of his Maje&s;ty's Speech from the Throne, to our own Parliament, at the Opening of this Se&s;&s;ion, has &s;ince that, been notified in Form to our Enemy. The Readine&s;s of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> to enter into a Treaty, and to give Peace to Chri&s;tendom, which Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Wolfenbuttle</HI> hath been authorized to communicate to the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ter at the <HI>Hague,</HI> will, no Doubt, open the Door for a Negotiation, in a Manner the mo&s;t likely to be embraced by the Court of <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI>; who&s;e Di&s;graces and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, (too great to be di&s;&s;embled, and too exten&s;ive to be remedied) will di&s;po&s;e them to li&s;ten with At|tention to every Propo&s;al of Accommodation, made to them by an Enemy who&s;e Sword was un&s;heathed only to puni&s;h Perfidy; and who&s;e Succe&s;&s;es, as appears from their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> fir&s;t Advances

towards a Treaty, have not infatuated them to prefer unnece&s;&s;ary and ruinous Conque&s;t, to a rea|&s;onable and &s;olid Peace.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, to be hoped, and to be believed, that Peace is not at a great Di&s;tance; and upon this Suppo&s;ition I &s;hall beg Leave to offer a few Con&s;iderations to <HI>you,</HI> as to the Per&s;ons on whom the Fate of this Country depends; Con&s;iderations which are equally important as they are &s;ea&s;onable; and an Attention to which, before you enter upon any Negotiation, may, perhaps, a&s;&s;i&s;t you (if I may be allowed to &s;uppo&s;e you &s;tand in Need of any A&s;&s;i&s;tance) in directing this Negotiation to &s;uch an I&s;&s;ue, as may be equally honourable to your&s;elves, and u&s;eful to the Public.</P>
<P>In this Situation of Affairs, one of the fir&s;t Mat|ters relative to the future Negotiation, which, no doubt, mu&s;t occur to you, will be the Choice of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who are to be tru&s;ted with the great Concerns of this Nation as <HI>Plenipotentiaries.</HI> As much will depend upon this Point, I &s;hall beg Leave to begin with giving you my Thoughts upon it, and the other Topics on which I propo&s;e to trouble you will naturally ari&s;e from each other without ob&s;erving any other <HI>Order,</HI> or Connection, be&s;ides that in which they &s;hall pre|&s;ent them&s;elves to a Mind intent upon its Subject.</P>
<P>With regard then to the Choice of <HI>Plenipoten|tiaries,</HI> I cannot but lament the Difficulties you have to encounter, before you will be able to find &s;uch as the Public will have Rea&s;on to thank you for.&mdash;I am not totally unknowing in the Charac|ters and Capacities of many among the great. But when I ca&s;t my Eyes around me, I own that I am &s;urprized, greatly &s;ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">zed, but &s;till more grieved, to find &s;o few among us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pable of conducting the arduous Ta&s;k <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Peace. Whether this

hath ari&s;en from Neglect in the Education of our Men of Quality; or whether the Qualifications which fit them for State&s;men, have been neglected, in Compari&s;on of &s;uch as fit them for <HI>Arthur</HI>'s or <HI>Newmarket</HI>; or whether it be owing to the State Policy &s;o &s;y&s;tematically adopted, of late Years, of giving Places, not to Per&s;ons who can be&s;t exe|cute the Bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;but to tho&s;e who can be&s;t do a Job; whatever be the Cau&s;e, the Fact is certain; and it is Matter of Amazement that there &s;hould be &s;o few in this I&s;land, who have given any Proofs that they are capable of conducting with Ability, much le&s;s with Dexterity, this important Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Nego|tiation with <HI>France.</HI> Men who are ver&s;ed in Trea|ties, knowing the Intere&s;ts, Preten&s;ions, and Con|nexions of the &s;everal Princes of <HI>Europe</HI>; &s;killed in the Principles of public Law, and capable of ap|plying them on every particular Occa&s;ion; ac|quainted with the Commerce, the Colonies, the Manufactures of their own Country; Ma&s;ters of all the In&s;tances of Infraction of former Treaties, which occa&s;ioned the War we are now engaged in: In a Word, Men who&s;e Rank and Con&s;equence among&s;t our&s;elves, may command Re&s;pect, and procure them Authority, among&s;t our Enemies; and who, to every other Qualification, already enumerated, can boa&s;t of an Integrity not to be cor|rupted, and a Steadine&s;s in &s;upporting the Inter|e&s;ts of their Country, which no Difficulties can di&s;|courage, and no Temptations can &s;hake:&mdash; Such are the Men, whom you mu&s;t endeavour to employ, in the approaching Negotiation, and &s;uch, I hope, ye will be able to find; though, I own, I am puzzled to gue&s;s on whom the Choice will fall, none being, as yet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ointed out by the pub|lic Voice, nor, perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> upon by your&s;elves. Times have been, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> have expected,

to &s;ee <HI>One</HI> named to &s;uch an important Office, meerly becau&s;e he was a Favourite, or a Favourite's Fa|vourite; becau&s;e he was connected with this Mini|&s;ter, or was a Relation of that great Man. But if we have too frequently trifled with our national Concerns, by tru&s;ting them in &s;uch Hands, I need not &s;ay that there are Circum&s;tances at pre&s;ent which give us rea&s;onable Ground for hoping that the &s;ame Sagacity, and De&s;ire to &s;erve the Public which hath found out, and employed the propere&s;t Per&s;ons to conduct the Operations of the War, will be exerted to find out the propere&s;t Per&s;ons (few as there are to be found) to conduct the Delibera|tions of the Treaty.</P>
<P>Very deplorable indeed mu&s;t be the Inabili|ties of the Per&s;ons we &s;hall employ, if their Nego|tiations for Peace be conducted &s;o awkwardly as to rob us of the Advantages we have gained by the War. If we may judge from late Events, <HI>France</HI> &s;eems as little to abound with Wi&s;dom in the Ca|binet, as it doth with Courage and Conduct in the Field. And if the Negotiations at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> in which almo&s;t all the Advantages of War equally &s;ucce&s;sful with the pre&s;ent, were given up, be urged as an In&s;tance of the &s;uperior Dexterity of <HI>French</HI> Politics, it ought to be remembered that this was more owing to our own Divi&s;ions, than to <HI>their</HI> Sagacity, and the Inabilities of our Plenipotentia|ries at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> tho' we had no great Rea&s;on, God knows, to brag of them. What, therefore, may we not expect from a Negotiation to be begun in very different Circum&s;tances; when there exi&s;ts no Faction who&s;e Intere&s;t it may be to perplex and de|feat it; and when that national Unanimity to which we, in a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> owe the Succe&s;s of the War, will &s;till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> it's ble&s;&s;ed Effects, till it make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and honourable
<PB N="8" REF="008585_0010_102F8AFD8C417F38">
Peace?&mdash;However, favourable as the&s;e Circum|&s;tances are, the Choice of &s;uch Plenipotentia|ries as may be likely to conduct the Negotiation, with Dignity, Dexterity and Integrity, becomes a Con&s;ideration which the Public will expect &s;hould be weighed with the utmo&s;t Attention. And, if &s;uch Per&s;ons cannot be found among&s;t us (which I hope may not be the Ca&s;e) there is a very de&s;irable Alternative &s;till in your Power. Fix the Scene of Negotiation, where, indeed, for the Honour of our Country, I could wi&s;h to &s;ee it fixed. Name no other Plenipotentiaries to conduct the Peace but tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who directed the War: And a Treaty of <HI>London,</HI> in &s;uch Hands, will make ample Amends for our wretched Management at <HI>Utrecht.</HI></P>
<P>But let Peace be ever &s;o well made; let Mi|ni&s;ters plan Treaties with the greate&s;t Sagacity, and Plenipotentiaries negotiate the Articles with the ut|mo&s;t Skill and Dexterity, yet we know from Hi&s;to|ry and Ob&s;ervation, that they never can be perpetual, and, mo&s;t commonly, are not la&s;ting. Princes, too frequently, &s;eem to own no other Rule of Action, than pre&s;ent Convenience; and the Law of Nations is &s;eldom appealed to, but to &s;anctify Inju&s;tice, and &s;ave Appearances. Nor are the po&s;itive Compacts &s;olemnly agreed upon between Nation and Nation, better ob&s;erved. For how &s;eldom do we &s;ee a Treaty religiou&s;ly adhered to, by the Parties who&s;e Intere&s;t it is to break it, and who think they are in &s;uch Circum&s;tances as to be able to break it with Impunity?&mdash;If &s;uch Infidelity be too common a|mong&s;t Princes in general, Experience, long Ex|perience teaches us, that the Nation with whom we are &s;oon to treat, excel us, at lea&s;t, in this Part of Policy. For no Cord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are &s;trong enough to bind them.</P>

And the Rea&s;on &s;eems to be ob|vious, without &s;uppo&s;ing that Nation more perfi|dious than others. The Power, the Populou&s;ne&s;s, the Extent, the Strength of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy, free them from tho&s;e Apprehen&s;ions which bind the weaker Side to be faithful to it's Engagements; and depending upon the Inability of their Neigh|bours, con&s;idered &s;ingly, to procure to them&s;elves Ju&s;tice, this, too frequently, has tempted them to the mo&s;t &s;hameful and barefaced In&s;tances of na|tional Breach of Faith.</P>
<P>It well becomes us, therefore, at this Juncture, when the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the <HI>French,</HI> we may hope, will oblige them to con&s;ent to Terms of Peace, unfa|vourable to the Intere&s;t, and di&s;graceful to the Glo|ry of their Monarch, to take every Method in our Power to &s;ecure the Ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e Con|ce&s;&s;ions they may make; and to in&s;i&s;t upon their giving us &s;uch Proofs of their Sincerity, before any Negotiation be entered upon, as may give us &s;ome A&s;&s;urance that they mean to be more faithful to their future Engagements.</P>

<P>The War which was clo&s;ed by the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI> had been undertaken with Views confined, altoge|ther, to the Continent of <HI>Europe,</HI> and carried on, though at an immen&s;e Expence, more to gain Con|que&s;ts for our Allies, than for our&s;elves. However, in the Treaty of Peace, &s;ome Advantages and Con|ce&s;&s;ions were &s;tipulated in Favour of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and its commercial Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>By the 12th Article, <HI>All</HI> Nova Scotia <HI>or</HI> Acadia, <HI>with its ancient Limits, and with all its Dependencies, is ceded to the Crown of</HI> Great Britain.</P>

<P>Let us now &s;ee how the&s;e Articles have been ob|&s;erved. The <HI>French</HI> &s;eem to have had two <HI>Capital Views</HI> in all their <HI>American</HI> Schemes, ever &s;ince they have thought Trade and Commerce an Object worthy of their Attention. The fir&s;t was to ex|tend them&s;elves from <HI>Canada,</HI> Southwards, through the Lakes along the Back of our Colonies; by which Means they might an&s;wer a double Purpo&s;e, of cutting off our Communication with the <HI>Indian Nations,</HI> and of opening a Communication for them&s;elves, between the Rivers <HI>St. Lawrence</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> and thus to join, as it were, their Colo|nies of <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Loui&s;iana.</HI> The other Part of their Plan, equally important, and more immedi|ately fatal to our Intere&s;ts in <HI>North America,</HI> was to gain a Communication with the Ocean; the only

Acce&s;s they now have to <HI>Canada,</HI> through the Ri|ver <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> being &s;hut up half the Year.</P>
<P>Full of this favorite Project of <HI>American</HI> Em|pire, &s;oon after the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> they began to enlarge their Boundaries on that Continent, in direct Violation of the &s;olemn Conce&s;&s;ions they had &s;o lately made.</P>
<P>As long ago as 1720, they &s;eized and fortified the mo&s;t important Pa&s;s in <HI>America,</HI> at <HI>Niagara</HI>; in that very Country of the <HI>Five Indian Nations,</HI> from which the 15th Article of the Treaty of <HI>U|trecht</HI> had excluded them. The infinite Con&s;e|quence of <HI>Niagara</HI> made them le&s;s &s;crupulous, no Doubt, about Treaties. For by Means of this U|&s;urpation they, in a Manner, became Ma&s;ters of the Lakes, and could, at Lei&s;ure extend them|&s;elves to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and carry their Chain of Forts and Settlements down to the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi.</HI></P>
<P>The Plan of U&s;urpation on the Back of our Colonies went on gradually and &s;ucce&s;sfully from Year to Year; the <HI>Indians</HI> owned by the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI> to be our Subjects, were debauched from our Intere&s;t, and &s;pirited up to ma&s;&s;acre, and &s;calp the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; and in 1731, the In&s;olence of the <HI>French</HI> grew to &s;uch an Heighth, that they erected their Fort at <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> in a Country indi&s;put|ably ours; whether con&s;idered as in the Center of the <HI>five Nations,</HI> or as actually within the Limits of <HI>New-York.</HI> And whoever ca&s;ts his Eye upon the Situation of this Fort, in the Map, will &s;ee how greatly the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it facilitated the Comple|tion of the great Object of opening a Communica|tion with the Ocean; and how much it expo&s;ed our mo&s;t valuable Colonies to <HI>Indian</HI> Ma&s;&s;acres and <HI>French</HI> Inva&s;ions.</P>

His fir&s;t, his only Object, was to pre&s;erve him&s;elf in Power; and as, in Pro&s;ecu|tion of &s;uch intere&s;ted and mercenary Views, he had actually engaged this Nation in an Alliance with <HI>France,</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> (to pull down the exorbi|tant Power of our old and natural Ally) it was no Wonder that he heard unmoved, and &s;uffered with Impunity, the <HI>French</HI> U&s;urpations in <HI>North-America.</HI></P>

But how was this Promi&s;e ob&s;erved? While the Commi&s;&s;aries trifled away their Time at <HI>Paris,</HI> the U&s;urpations went on in <HI>America</HI>; Incur&s;ions were frequently made into the Penin&s;ula of <HI>Aca|dia,</HI> the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or which they did not pretend to di&s;pute with us; Forts were built by them in &s;everal Places, and particularly a mo&s;t important One to command the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI>; thus decid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng by the Sword, in Time of full Peace, that Contro|ver&s;y which they them&s;elves had agreed &s;hould be amicably adju&s;ted by their Commi&s;&s;aries; and fur|ni&s;hing a la&s;ting Warning to us, that a Treaty which leaves Points of Con&s;equence to be de|termined by any After-Conferences, only &s;erves to light up another War.</P>
<P>While the <HI>French</HI> U&s;urpations went on &s;o in&s;o|lently in <HI>Nova Scotia</HI>; the Plan was carrying on with equal Perfidy on the Banks of the <HI>Ohio</HI>; a Country, the Inhabitants of which had been in Al|liance with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> above an hundred Years ago; an Alliance frequently renewed; to which al&s;o we had a Claim as being a Conque&s;t of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and from which, therefore, the <HI>French</HI> were excluded by the 15th Article of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> above recited. But what avail Treaties when Intere&s;t comes in Competition?

<P>From this Period we may look upon the War as begun.

<P>No Doubt the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters flattered them|&s;elves that <HI>England,</HI> inattentive to the Intere&s;ts of its Colonies for &s;o many Years before, and who, &s;o lately, had &s;ubmitted to a Di&s;advantageous Peace, would not have the Spirit to oppo&s;e Force to Force, and do it&s;elf Ju&s;tice by other Weapons than the Complaints of Lord <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">marle,</HI> and the Memorials of Mr. <HI>Mildmay.</HI> But the Hour of Vengeance was, at la&s;t, come; the Intere&s;ts of the Kingdom were attended to by tho&s;e in Power; the infinite Importance of our <HI>American</HI> Colonies was under&s;tood, and a Re&s;olution taken to have Re|cour&s;e to Arms.

frankly made no Scruple of telling the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> be|fore-hand, that this Expedient, which had been devi&s;ed to prevent the Union of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> under one Monarch, would be of little Force, as being incon&s;i&s;tent with the fundamental Laws of <HI>France</HI>; by this Declaration giving us a very re|markable In&s;tance of the Weakne&s;s, or of the Wickedne&s;s of our then Mini&s;ters, who could build the Peace of <HI>Europe</HI> on &s;o &s;andy a Foundation, and accept of Terms which <HI>France</HI> it&s;elf was hone&s;t enough to own were not to be kept.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Regent</HI> was re&s;olved to &s;upport his Claim to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> in Exclu&s;ion to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Branch; and, as the Support and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>England</HI> was nece&s;&s;ary for this Pur|po&s;e, it is not to be wondered at that he &s;hould court the Friend&s;hip of a Nation from whom he had &s;o much to expect; and therefore, he was wi&s;e enough to do us Ju&s;tice, by carrying into Execution, in &s;ome Degree, the Article relating to <HI>Dunkirk.</HI></P>
<P>The per&s;onal Intere&s;t of the Regent was the on|ly Rea&s;on for this Compliance: But &s;ucceeding Admini&s;trations in <HI>France</HI> not being influenced by the &s;ame private Views to adhere to Treaties &s;o|lemnly ratified, <HI>Dunkirk</HI> began gradually to ri&s;e from its Ruins; its Port again received Ships; its Trade flouri&s;hed; <HI>England</HI> &s;aw it&s;elf deprived of this favourite Advantage gained at <HI>Utrecht</HI>; and &s;uch was the A&s;cendency of <HI>French</HI> Councils over tho&s;e of this I&s;land, at the Period I &s;peak of, that we were actually engaged in Alliances with <HI>France,</HI> while that Nation was thus openly in&s;ult|ing us, and in&s;ulting us, without Ob&s;truction, in &s;o e&s;&s;ential an Article.

made; and when an Inquiry concerning this was propo&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Commons by a great Parliament Man <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir W. Wyndham.</NOTE> &s;ince dead, the then Mini&s;ter hung his Head, in the Hou&s;e, for Shame. And who could have believed it po&s;&s;ible, that the &s;ame Per&s;on who had been &s;o ready to promote a Par|liamentary Inquiry into this Violation of the Peace in 1713, &s;hould ob&s;truct &s;uch an Inquiry, when he him&s;elf was in Power, though the Rea&s;ons for it had become much &s;tronger?

<P>While <HI>England</HI> remained &s;o aver&s;e to do it&s;elf Ju&s;tice, no Wonder that <HI>France</HI> improved the Opportunity. At the Time when that <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> was obliged to retire from Power, the Re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was compleated. For, in a little more than a Year after <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Memorial is dated <HI>July</HI> 1, 1742.</NOTE>, we find a Memorial pre&s;ented by Lord <HI>Stair</HI> to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> com|plaining of this Violation of the Peace of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and urging it as a Rea&s;on for their joining us again&s;t <HI>France.</HI> And as it was for the Honour of the new Admini&s;tration, that they began with Mea&s;ures &s;o &s;pirited and national, it is equally remarkable, that the &s;ame Per&s;on, who had threat|ened <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. in his own Palace, for his Slow|ne&s;s in demoli&s;hing <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> lived to be again employed by his Country at the Di&s;tance of near thirty Years, when the Re&s;toration of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> be|came an Object of national Re&s;entment.</P>

Proof that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was again a <HI>Port,</HI> and a Port which may be made U&s;e of, to endanger the Safe|ty of <HI>Britain.</HI> At the Time I now &s;peak of <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 1743-4.</NOTE>, we beheld the Harbour of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> crowded with Tran&s;ports to embark Count <HI>Saxe</HI> and the <HI>Preten|der</HI> to invade us.

<P>Though we have no great Rea&s;on to brag of the Treaty made at the Conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t War (which I am a&s;hamed to call a Peace, as it &s;ettled nothing that was before in Doubt between the two Nations) the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI> concerning <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> was, neverthele&s;s in its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Part, re|&s;tored to its full Force.

<P>Little or nothing was done between the Conclu|&s;ion of the Peace, and the breaking out of the pre|&s;ent War, towards carrying into Execution this fre&s;h Promi&s;e. On the contrary, the enlarging of the Fortifications of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> is mentioned in his Maje&s;ty's Declaration of War, three Years ago, as one of the fre&s;h Heads of Injury offered to <HI>Eng|land.</HI> And whoever reflects upon the Tran&s;actions, &s;ince that Period, will &s;ee that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is re&s;tored to its original Importance. Its Privateers have done infinite Mi&s;chief to our Trade; a Squadron of his Maje&s;ty's Navy, in vain blocked up its Har|bour lately, to prevent the &s;ailing of <HI>Thurot</HI>'s

<P>The above Enumeration of <HI>French</HI> Infidelities, in general, and in particular their Behaviour to <HI>England</HI> with regard to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and with regard to <HI>North-America,</HI> &s;o naturally points out the <HI>Expediency</HI> and <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of the Hints I &s;hall now offer, that, in pro|po&s;ing them, I may well hope not to have them ridi|culed as the Reveries of a chimerical <HI>St. Pierre,</HI> but rather attended to, as the &s;ober Dictates of Prudence, and of a Zeal not altogether devoid of Knowledge.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Then, <HI>my Lord and Sir,</HI> before you enter upon any New Treaty, or li&s;ten to any plau&s;ible Propo&s;als whatever, in&s;i&s;t that Ju&s;tice may be done this Nation, with regard to former Treaties. Shew <HI>France</HI> the &s;trong, the &s;olemn Engagement &s;he entered into at <HI>Utrecht</HI> to demoli&s;h <HI>Dunkirk</HI>; put her in Mind of the amazing Perfidy with which &s;he, from Time to Time, eluded the Perfor|mance of that Engagement; and demand <HI>imme|diate</HI> Ju&s;tice on that Article, as a preliminary Proof of her Sincerity in the en&s;uing Negotiation.</P>
<P>Be not deceived any longer in this Matter. The <HI>French</HI> will, no doubt, a&s;&s;ure you that the Demo|lition of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> &s;hall be an Article in the New Treaty. But let them know, you are not to be <HI>&s;o</HI> impo&s;ed upon. They wlll, to be &s;ure, when this becomes a new Article, reckon it a new Conce&s;|&s;ion on their Side, and expect &s;omething in return for it,&mdash;perhaps <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch Trifle, as they will call it. But tell them with the Firm|ne&s;s of wi&s;e Conquerors, that the Demolition of
<PB N="25" REF="008585_0027_102F8B27CFD75FC8">
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> is what you are intitled to by Treaties made long ago, and violated; and that it &s;hall not be &s;o much as mentioned in the in&s;uing Negotiation, but complied with before that Negotiation &s;hall commence.</P>
<P>Or, admitting that no Conce&s;&s;ion &s;hould be re|quired by <HI>France</HI> in the New Treaty, in Con&s;ider|ation of a new Article to demoli&s;h <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> place to them, in the &s;tronge&s;t Light, the unan&s;werable Rea&s;ons we have again&s;t putting any Confidence in them, that &s;uch an Article would be better executed, than that in the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> has been.</P>
<P>If they refu&s;e doing us this immediate Ju&s;tice, previous to the Peace; a&s;k them how they can ex|pect that we &s;hould have any Reliance on their Sin|cerity to fulfil the New Engagements they may enter into, when they afford us &s;o &s;trong, &s;o glar|ing an In&s;tance of Infidelity, in an Article of &s;uch Con&s;equence, made &s;o many Years ago? Can you have any Dealings with a Power, who, if he refu&s;es this, at the very Time he is treating, affords you &s;uch manife&s;t Proof, that his Word is not to be re|lied upon, and that you cannot tru&s;t to the Execu|tion of any Promi&s;e ever &s;o &s;olemnly made?</P>
<P>Perhaps <HI>France</HI> may think it a Di&s;grace to them, to comply with any Thing previous to the Begin|ning of a Negotiation. Tell them, that acting honourably, and doing what Ju&s;tice requires, can never be di&s;graceful. But if it be a Di&s;grace, tell them, with the Spirit of hone&s;t Men, that we owe it them, for the greater Di&s;grace they put, not long ago, upon us, by requiring us to &s;end two Peers of this Realm to remain in <HI>France</HI> as <HI>Ho&s;tages,</HI> till we &s;urrendered <HI>Loui&s;bourg</HI>; an Indignity which I cannot call to Mind without Pain, and which, I always thought, was &s;ubmitted to without Nece&s;|&s;ity.</P>

<P>To con&s;ider this Affair in its proper Light, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to reflect on the infinite Con&s;e|quence of <HI>North America</HI> to this Country.

It is entirely owing to the <HI>German</HI> Part of the War that <HI>France</HI> appears thus low in the political Scale of Strength and Riches; that &s;he is found to be a &s;inking Monarchy, nay a Monarchy already &s;unk.

<P>But what I lament as the greate&s;t Misfortune that can threaten the public Liberty, is to &s;ee the Eagerne&s;s with which our Nobility, born to be the Guardians of the Con&s;titution again&s;t Prerogative, &s;ollicit the Badge of <HI>military</HI> Subjection, not meerly to &s;erve their Country, in Times of Danger, which would be commendable, but in Expectation to be continued <HI>Soldiers,</HI> when Tranquility &s;hall be re|&s;tored, and to be under <HI>military Command,</HI> during Life. When I &s;ee this &s;trange, but melancholy Infatuation, &s;o prevalent, I almo&s;t de&s;pair of the Con&s;titution.

that our Mini&s;ters have happily got rid of a &s;et of very <HI>u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> or very <HI>pernicious</HI> Gentlemen called <HI>Mediators,</HI> by applying directly to the Enemy him|&s;elf. Nothing can be more ridiculous than the Fi|gure of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Nuncio, and the Amba&s;&s;ador of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rce of Mediation at <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> for &s;everal Years, while the War went on, till its Eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s regulated the Terms of Peace. The Media|tion of <HI>In&s;ignificant</HI> Powers is therefore ab&s;urd; and the Danger of calling in a <HI>powerful</HI> Mediator, who may threaten to declare again&s;t you, if you do not &s;ubmit to his <HI>partial</HI> Deci&s;ions, is too obvious to be in&s;i&s;ted upon. You have done wi&s;ely, therefore, to keep the Negotiation in your own Hands; the Nation, from this In&s;tance, has a full Confidence that her Intere&s;ts are &s;kilfully conducted; and, therefore, I &s;hall only add, another Particular, which however &s;ubordinate, will, no Doubt, be at|tended to by you; though <HI>&s;ome late</HI> Negotiators of ours, with <HI>France,</HI> neglected it.</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> by taking the Lead in <HI>Europe</HI> of late, have, of Cour&s;e, been able to introduce their Lan|guage in all public Negotiations; &s;o that, perhaps, the <HI>French</HI> is the only Tongue, by the Channel of which Plenipotentiaries and Mini&s;ters of different Countries, can conver&s;e. But when the Negotiation is to be put into Writing, to be drawn up in that Form which is to be binding upon all the Parties, and &s;igned jointly by the treating Powers, neither the Honour, nor the Intere&s;t of the State, ought to allow us, to accept of the Original Treaty in the <HI>Native Tongue</HI> of our Enemies. The Honour of the Nation forbids this; as it would be a Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Superiority, to which <HI>Britain,</HI> at no Time, much le&s;s after &s;o glorious a War, &s;hould &s;ubmit; e&s;pecially as we cannot &s;ubmit to it, without giving the Enemy a real Advantage, and laying the Foun|dation

for future Cavils.&mdash;Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> in his Letters, boa&s;ts, that by a latent Ambiguity and Nicety in the <HI>French</HI> Stile, he had been able to out|wit <HI>Don Louis de Haro,</HI> in the Conferences at the <HI>Pyren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es.</HI> And a much later In&s;tance, in which we our&s;elves were partly concerned, &s;hould confirm us, in our Refu&s;al to treat with the <HI>French</HI> in their own Language.&mdash;I mean the famous Capitulation of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Garri&s;on of <HI>Tournay</HI> in 1745; which, though only re&s;trained from acting, for a limited Time in any of the Barrier Towns <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have not the original Capitulation before me, but I remember pretty exactly on what the Cavil turned. The Troops were not to act, I think, for two Years, in any of the Places <HI>le plus recul&eacute;es de la Barriere.</HI> The <HI>Dutch,</HI> no Doubt, un|der&s;tood, <HI>de la Barriere</HI> to be the <HI>Genitive</HI> Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, but the <HI>French</HI> &s;aid they meant it in the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lative.</HI></NOTE>, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> believed, when they accepted of the Capitulation, was &s;oon after interpreted by <HI>France,</HI> as tying them up from acting in any Part of the World; and might have been fatal to this Country, if the Re|bellion in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t in quelling which the <HI>Dutch</HI> lent us tho&s;e very Troops, had been &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sful, as to oblige us, to put our foreign Allies to the Te&s;t.</P>
<P>We have no great Rea&s;on, no more than other Nations, to tru&s;t <HI>Gallic Faith,</HI> as appears from the many In&s;tances of their <HI>unp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lliated</HI> Perfidy which I have collected above. Let us not, therefore, be &s;o weak as to give them Room for obtruding upon us, any fallacious Interpretations of the Words, in which they plight their Faith. They are too ready to break it when the Terms are ever &s;o clear; and, therefore, let us take Care not to give them that Advantage which &s;uperior Skill in their own Lan|guage, naturally confers, and which upon &s;ome future Occa&s;ion, they may improve to our Detriment.

Let the <HI>original and authentic</HI> Copy of the Treaty, therefore, be in a dead Language, the Phra&s;es of which cannot vary, and who&s;e Meaning is equally under&s;tood by both Parties. We had once a very learned Plenipotentiary in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, who, in a Negotiation with <HI>Spain,</HI> when it came to be debated in what Language the Treaty &s;hould be made, ludicrou&s;ly enough propo&s;ed to the <HI>Spa|niard,</HI> who was giving him&s;elf Airs of Superiority, to treat in the Language of his Ma&s;ter's Kingdom of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> But, leaving the <HI>Hebrew</HI> for our Divines, I would only have our Negotiators treat in <HI>Latin:</HI> Which &s;eemed, as it were by Pre&s;crip|tion, to have a Right to be the Language of the Public Law of <HI>Europe</HI>; till &s;ome late&punc; In&s;tances have &s;hewn that the <HI>French</HI> was beginning to be &s;ub&s;tituted in its Room; by the Lazine&s;s or Ne|glect of tho&s;e who treated. As we are &s;anguine in our Hopes of a much better Peace than we had at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> with Regard to the Terms, let it not be wor&s;e than that at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> which pre&s;erved the Old Cu&s;tom of &s;ettling the Negotiation in <HI>Latin.</HI> We then had a Bi&s;hop indeed, as Plenipotentiary; but without having Recour&s;e to the very learned Bench, or choo&s;ing a Plenipotentiary from <HI>Cambridge</HI> (I hope in a little Time one may join the other U|niver&s;ity without giving Offence) the Negotiators at the en&s;uing Peace, may be accommodated with <HI>Latin</HI> enough for the Purpo&s;e I mention, at a very moderate Expence&mdash;If their Secretary or Chaplain cannot a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>But when I begin to be ludicrous on &s;o &s;erious a Subject, it is Time to have done: And my Ad|dre&s;s has already &s;welled to &s;uch a Size as &s;urprizes my&s;elf, as much, as I fear it will tire the Reader. However, the va&s;t Variety of Facts and Particulars which naturally offered them&s;elves to me, and which
<PB N="55" REF="008585_0057_102F8AD97B1F3160">
could not be omitted without hurting the Con|nection, and weakning my Argument, will, per|haps, procure Indulgence for &s;o long a Pamphlet: And, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, I flatter my&s;elf, that if I &s;hould happen to have been mi&s;taken in any Thing I advance, to have erred in a Date, or to have mi&s;quoted a Treaty, &s;ome Allowances will be made to me, as I have been obliged to tru&s;t much to my Memory, for Want of a proper Opportuni|ty of con&s;ulting many of tho&s;e Books, which fur|ni&s;h the Materials I have made u&s;e of. However, I believe a candid Reader will find no <HI>capital,</HI> at lea&s;t, no <HI>wilful,</HI> Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>I am far from the Vanity of thinking that my Notions on the important Subject of the Peace, are a regular Plan or Sy&s;tem for the Admini&s;tra|tion to proceed upon. I throw them out, only as loo&s;e Hints for my <HI>Superiors,</HI> to improve as they may think proper. Should there be any Weight in all, or any of them, you, <HI>My Lord</HI> and <HI>Sir,</HI> will be able to work them into Utility for this Kingdom. If they are not worth your Notice; as I am an anonymous Writer, and hope never to be known, I can neither loo&s;e nor gain Reputation by them. All I can &s;ay, if they are neglected, is, <HI>Operam et Oleam perdidi.</HI></P>

He reflected upon his Youth; and ob&s;erved that the Di&s;covery of Truth was very little promoted by pompous Diction and theatrical Emotion, The&s;e In&s;inuations expo&s;ed him to a &s;evere Reply.

<Q>He would not undertake to determine whether Youth could be ju&s;tly imputed to any Man as a Re|proach: But he affirmed, that the Wretch, who, after having &s;een the Con&s;equences of repeated Errors, continues &s;till to blunder, and who&s;e Age has only added Ob&s;tinacy to Stupidity, is &s;urely the Object of either Abhorrence or Contempt, and de&s;erves not that his grey Head &s;hould &s;ecure him from In&s;ults.

<P>WILLIAM PITT, E&s;q. had been originally de&s;igned for the Army, in which he act|ually bore a Commi&s;&s;ion; but Fate re&s;erved him for a more important Station. In Point of For|tune he was barely qualified to be elected Member of Parliament, when he obtained a Seat in the Hou&s;e of Commons, where he &s;oon out&s;hone all his Compatriots. He di&s;played a &s;urprizing Extent and Preci&s;ion of political Knowledge, and irre&s;i&s;ti|ble Energy of Argument, and &s;uch Power of Elocution, as &s;truck his Hearers with A&s;toni&s;hment and Admiration: It fla&s;hed, like the Ligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ning of Heaven, again&s;t the Mini&s;ters and Sons of Cor|ruption, bla&s;ting where it &s;mote, and withering the Nerves of Oppo&s;ition.
