<PB N="7" REF="000588_0006_0FA95823E06AB4C0">
The Coroner Impannelled an Inquest, who upon viewing the Corps, and diligently searching the same, they found his Neck was very limber, &amp; much shrivelled upon the skin, and seemed more blew than other parts of his body. They sent for the Prisoner; when he was brought, he was bid to touch the Corps, the which he did do, and wished most execrable Wishes, <HI>That God would send some suddain Judg|ment upon him, if ever he murthered</HI> John Clark; saying, <HI>if he had murthered him, he would bleed afresh</HI>; saying, <HI>Poor innocent man! why should I destroy him?</HI></P>
<P>The Corooners Inquest, seventeen in Number, with|drew to consider of their Verdict.</P>
<P>They sent for the Prisoner, asked him to tell them, how he came to the fore-mentioned Goods? He said, he had been with <HI>John Clark</HI> in the Evening, and bought some Threed Buttons of him for some old Cask, and when he came home, his Wife told him, she wanted some blew Tape, and some Mettle Buttons for the Children; where|upon he went to the Town Landing, and finding the Boat gone, he went to <HI>Windhame,</HI> and from thence he saw the Boat near near <HI>Salem Creeks Mouth,</HI> then there was three Canows at <HI>Windham</HI> Landing, and he took one of them, which was a knotty Canow, and went to the Boat, finding no body in it, he took the Goods, and put them into the Canow, brought them to <HI>Windham</HI> Landing about half an hour before Sun rising; he hid the <HI>English Goods</HI> in <HI>Wind|ham</HI> Marsh, and carried a parcel of Cheese home that Morning, and fetcht the other Goods home about two or three dayes after.</P>
<P>Several Persons that were of the said Inquest, were at <HI>Windham</HI> the same Morning (about Sun rising,) that the Prisoner said he landed the Goods there, and they do affirm,

<HEAD>King's Attorney</HEAD>
<P>May it please the Court, The Prisoner at the Bar is now to be tryed, and that by the good old Laws of <HI>England,</HI> the beginning of which Tryal is his Presentment, which is already found by the grand Inquest. He is now to come to his Tryal by Twelve men of his Peers, and of the Neighbourhood legally constituted, who, I trust, will do Justice indifferently; and <HI>Magna Charta, The Petition of Right,</HI> and many Statutes do confirm this way of Tryal; and I hope the Court, and all that hear&punc; and see their Proceedings, will receive full satisfaction in the Legality and Fairness of their Proceedings against him, and himself the benefit of Justice and Law.</P>
<P>Let none say, The Prisoner is not tryed and judged according to the Fundamental Laws of <HI>England:</HI> The Judgment is given in by twelve men of the Neighbour|hood
(<HI>vid. Cooks com. upon Littleton</HI>)
the Justices are but to inform the Jury in matters of Law, and to pro|nounce the Sentence and Judgment written against the Prisoner, and order the same Judgment to be put in Execution.</P>
<P>Where there is a Superiour Power. inferiour Magi|strates
<PB N="9" REF="000588_0008_0FA95825A3BDD760">
have their Power limitted; but among Equals in Authority (as it is in this Province of <HI>West-Jarsey</HI>) there is no Superiority, therefore those Magistrates that are in Power here, ought to defend the Weak, punish the Wicked, and be just to all, acting as there is need, and as the Times, Persons and Accidents do require, and accor|ding to the Exigency, Distress and Necessity of the case. In vain are good Laws made, if there be none to put them in Execution.</P>
<P>May it please this Court, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, You are here for the Trying and Judging of <HI>Thomas Lutherland,</HI> Prisoner at the Bar, for his notorious Mur|thering of <HI>John Clark,</HI> late one of the King and Queen of <HI>England</HI>'s Subjects, and for the Fellonious taking and carrying away his Goods: He hath been a notorious fellon in <HI>England,</HI> at Sea, in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and in this County of <HI>Salem,</HI> stands now before you to receive the good of Justice.</P>
<P>The King and Queen of <HI>England</HI> have lost a Subject, who was in Health at the common Landing place in <HI>Salem</HI> Town after Sun set the 11th day of <HI>November,</HI> 1691. and on the next Morning the said <HI>John Clark</HI> was not to be found, but his Boat robbed, and divers parcels of goods felloniously taken &amp; carried away by the Prisoner, as himself has confessed. That <HI>John Clark</HI> was murthered by the Prisoner at the Bar, seventeen Reputable Persons, on the Coroners Inquest, has given it in their Verdict, and this Fellony has relation to the Murther, for the Murther was committed for love to the Goods. If it be found that <HI>A. B.</HI> was murthered in the Night, and the Goods that he had with him at the time of his Death, shall be found in the possession of <HI>C. D.</HI> the next Morning be|fore
<PB N="10" REF="000588_0009_0FA958260780CAA8">
Sun rising, it does naturally and necessarily imply, That <HI>C. D.</HI> murthered <HI>A. B.</HI> for the love of his Goods: Had the Prisoner taken the Goods, and spared the mans Life, the man would have discovered him, for he knew him; therefore, because otherwise, take the Goods with|out being discovered, he took away the mans Life also.</P>
<P>The Prisoner himself has disproved himself in his several Examinations: All Circumstances concurs with the Grand Inquests Judgment, <HI>That the Prisoner at the Bar is guilty both of the Murther and Fellony charged upon him.</HI> First, he said, he brought the Cheese home in the Evening, and left the English Goods in <HI>George Hazlwoods</HI> Shallop till the next Morning. Another time he sayes, he brought the Cheese home from <HI>Windham Landing,</HI> and hid the <HI>English Goods</HI> there in the Marsh for two or three dayes.</P>
<P>All his Serpentine Turnings, and Windings, and Self-contradictions are but like <HI>Irish Quag-Mires</HI> that have no sollid Ground, or Reason: He is incorporated into Evil by a long habit, in such sort, that his Understanding it self approveth it, and consenteth thereunto; His heart is so hardened, that Wickedness is therein rooted and framed, and as it were naturalized, end his Soul infected and wholly tainted therewith. All his Evasions whereby he endeavours to avoid the Punishment, are but the tying an Artificial Knot in the Halter, whereby to strangle his Conscience.</P>
<P>The Truth or Falseness, respectively, lies in the strength or weakness of the Arguments that are brought in de|fence of them&punc; There is not any of the Prisoners Con|fessions that he hath made at several times, but one is repugnant to the other&punc; all his study cannot make his
<PB N="11" REF="000588_0010_0FA95829466B0D18">
words speak Reason, but doubtful and ambiguous words, with particular Reserves, argues a base Mind.</P>
<P>It is usual and necessarily lawful to judge of Causes by the Effects, that naturally and necessarily flow from them: The Man is found Murthered, and his Goods some found in the Prisoners house, some hid in the Hay, and some hid among Corn out of the House Evil Actions shew an evil Intent, and both put together declares Guilt.</P>
<P>Concerning my self, I bear no Malice to the mans Person, than I do to my dearest Friend; but I hate that cursed Principle of Cruelty and Fellony, which hath so long harboured in him.</P>
<P>And now, as the Truth is, I must conclude him guilty of the Murther and Fellony charged upon him; and that he who hath made himself a President in these parts of the World, in committing such Wickedness, I humbly desire, that this Court, for Justice sake, would make him an Example for others, for time to come, that men may hear and fear, and do no more so wickedly; That he, who would not be a Pattern to other Trades-men to live honestly in this Life, may be a President of Justice by his Death.</P>
<P>When the Prisoner was first apprehended, the Justice commanded the Constable to search his Pookets, from whence the Constable took a small parcel of Papers tyed together, and the Prisoner said, they were his own Papers; but when they were opened, the first Paper viewed, was a Bill from <HI>John Gillman</HI> to pay <HI>John Clark</HI> thirty Shillings; Then a large Paper was taken out of his Pocket, and he said, <HI>That was his Deed for a Town Lot he had lately purchased</HI>; but being viewed, it appeared to
<PB N="12" REF="000588_0011_0FA95829C67A5728">
be a Deed for Land that <HI>John Clark</HI> had purchased: Be|ing asked, how he got those Writings? he said, <HI>He found <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI> I am fully satisfied, the Prisoner <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to dye: And it is a special use of Justice to con|demn one that is accustomed to Wickedness, and suffers <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> strength in him, and he grows obstinate <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it, that such an one may serve for an Example unto others.

<P><HI>Prisoner.</HI> I have been a great Sinner, and have con|tinued in my sins until this fortieth Year of my Age, and have committed more sins than man could almost com|mit, for <HI>Drunkenness, Whoring, Swearing, Tempting Young Women to Debauchery,</HI> and then leave them; then for <HI>Theft,</HI> and now for <HI>Murder.</HI> I was convicted of Fellony in <HI>England,</HI> for which I was Transported into <HI>Pennsilvan<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">a</HI>&punc; I consented to the stealing of several parcels of Goods on Ship-board, which is the same as doing the Fact: In <HI>Pennsilvania</HI> I was convicted of several Thefts, but could take no warning by all this.</P>
<P>I pray&punc; good People take care of your Goods, and leave them not in Our houses carelesly, which are great Temp|tations

to sinners, the Devil takes such opportunities to perswade sinners to S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">eal and Rob. I declare, I never took any Goods out of a House that was lockt. Good people pray take warning by my Example, I have been a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to many, but consider, the Pitcher goes not so often to the Well, but comes home broke at last.</P>
<P>What I said in denying the Murther of <HI>John Clark,</HI> I find God hath shewed an Example by me: Think not, that Murther will ever be hid, the very Leaves of the Trees will discover Murther: When I touched the Murthered Corps of <HI>John Clark,</HI> I was afraid the Blood would have flown in my face: Pray take heed, Young and Old, this hard heart of mine is the greatest Enemy I have. I for|give all.</P>
<P>When I sold <HI>John Clark</HI> the empty Casks, he shewed me several sorts of Goods for my pay: I was to go over the River to receive some pay due to me, and the Devil tempted me to take away this mans Goods; intending to sell them there; but I knew I could not take away the Goods without killing the man: This was three or four dayes before he went to <HI>John Gillmans</HI>; when he was gone there, I began to bless the Lord, he had prevented the Wickedness in my heart, thinking he had been gone; but when I went down to the Landing, I met him, and he brought me my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and told me, if I wanted any Goods he had, I shou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> freely have them. I was sorry for seeing him, for then the Temptation came strong upon me. I went down with him, and bought some Three B<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">tons; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> I went away from the Boat, I told him, he had a cold place: He answered, he had a warm Cab|bin; and I bid him wrap himself warm. As I was going home, my heart mis-gave me, and I thought, <HI>Why should

I destroy this Innocent Creature.</HI> When I came home, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Nicholas Philip<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> to buy some Tools of me, which I sold him; so he supped with me, and after Supper asked me to go to the Ordinary to drink a pot of Beer; I went with him, and we drank two pots of Beer, and one Gill of Rum: After I parted with him; and as I went to go home, the Devil's Temptation came so strong, I put my foot over the fence, intending to fetch a Bag to put the Goods in; but I thought my Wife would betray me, so with-drew my foot, and went down to the boat thinking I should find something there to put the Goods in: When I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to the Boat the man was in the Cabbin, I counterfeited <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Voice, and asked, Whose Boat it was? He answered, <HI>Mine:</HI> I asked, where he was going? He said, <HI>Vp the River:</HI> I told him, I must go to <HI>New-Castle,</HI> he said, <HI>He wou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d carry me, if I would pay him:</HI> I told him, I would pay him nothing, I must have your Boat&punc; so he put up his head, I suppose to cry out: I bid him put down his Head; he said, <HI>He would be still</HI>; so I took an end of a Roap, and put about his Neck; he cryed, <HI>Friend do not destroy me, he that Created me, Created thee; Remem|ber thy Creator and Redeemer, and have Mercy upon me, as you expect Mercy from God:</HI> So I told him, I would not destroy him; but he said, <HI>I think you intend to Choak me.</HI> I asked him, if he had got any Money? He said, he had got some Wampum; so he cryed, <HI>Spare my Life, and take my Goods</HI>; but I pulled both ends of the Roap together (he cryed, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon my Soul! Lord have Mercy upon my Soul!</HI>) till he was dead; then I took the Keyes out of his Pocket, and unlockt his Chests, and put his Goods into a Sack; but before I removed them, came <HI>William Penton,</HI> and some others, and he cryed, <HI>Let us call John

Clark</HI>; so I lay down in the Waste of the Boat, and covered my self with some Sacks: When they were gone, I removed the Goods into <HI>George Hazlwood's</HI> Sloop, and rowed <HI>Clarks</HI> Boat down to <HI>Windham,</HI> and hawled him over board, but could not make him sink, which put me into great fear; then I jumpt on shore w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">th the Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">t of the Boat, and left the Boat a d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ift; so returned back to the Sloop, and removed the Goods, and hid them in a Hay-stack, and in two or three dayes removed them into my own Hay-stack, and afterwards, un|known to my Wife, brought them into my Chamber, where they were found; and upon the finding of these Goods, I was committed.</P>
<P>I confess my great Sin in Marrying a Wife in this Country, having a Wife and Child at <HI>Clay Cott<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> in <HI>North|hamptonshire.</HI> I have been very disobedient to my Parents, a great Breaker of Sabbaths, which was the cause of my habit of sin: I had rather go to an Ale-house than to any Church. Pray Young People take warning by my shamefull end: Keep the Sabbath truly: Go to any Religious Meetings, whether of your own Perswasion or not. The Devil is alwayes at hand to tempt Sinners. I have had great Oppression upon my Spirit since I was in this Prison&punc; and I thought I should never Repent or Confess until almighty God softned my hard Heart and gave me Grace to Repent. I beg all good People to joyn in Prayers with me. I have great need of your Prayers.</P>
