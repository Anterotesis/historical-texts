<P>HIS Excellency admini&s;tred an Oath of Secrecy to the Lieutenant Governour, <HI>Edward Randolph,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and <HI>Thomas Weaver,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> they not being Members of the Council.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip appointed <HI>Thomas Weaver,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to act as Council at Law in behalf of his Maje&s;ty, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t to take the Minits of the Council.</P>
<P>By his Lord&s;hips Command a Letter was read from his Grace the Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> principal Secretary of State, to his Lord&s;hip, Governour of <HI>New-York,</HI> in relation to Pyrats.</P>
<P>By his Lord&s;hips Command, the Letter to his Lord&s;hip from <HI>James Vernon,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Secretary to their Excellencies, the Lords Ju&s;tices of <HI>England,</HI> in relation to Pyrats was read; as likewi&s;e a &s;econd Letter from Mr. <HI>Vernon,</HI> with Memorials from the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company, of Damages done in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> by Pyrats belonging to <HI>New-York,</HI> the &s;aid Pyrats being reported to have Commi&s;&s;ions and Protections from the late Gover|nour, Coll. <HI>Fletcher</HI> and a Command to his Lord&s;hip to make enquiry into the &s;ame</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip then told the Gentlemen of the Council, That the occa&s;ion of his calling them was to have their Advice in relation to &s;ome Di&s;coveries he had made about Pyrats, and de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Weaver</HI> to open the matter to them.</P>
<P>Who enlarged upon the &s;trict Orders given by his Maje&s;ty again&s;t Pyrats, to the Governour of <HI>New-York,</HI> and now read to them, of the Nature of the Crime of Pyracy, how involv'd with other Crimes, e&s;pecially Murder, and the ill Con&s;equences that attend it: How far his Maje&s;ties Honour is prejudiced, with regard to his Allyes: The great lo&s;s and de&s;truction of the Trade of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company of <HI>England,</HI> and therein the va&s;t lo&s;s of his Maje&s;ties Revenue, and to the Ruin of his Maje&s;ties Subjects by Reprizals made on their Effects in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies:</HI> The di&s;honour done to his Maje&s;ty. That any of his Governours &s;hould grant Commi&s;&s;ions to Pyrates, or that they &s;hould grant Protections to prevent Pro&s;ecutions for a Crime abhorr'd by all civil Governments, all

which is a betraying the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>That his Lord&s;hip had received full Information that Coll. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> late Governour of this Province, had admitted notorious known Pyrats to bring in their Spoils to the City of <HI>New York,</HI> and had granted them Protections under his Hand and Seal, for which he had received con&s;iderable Rewards from them, they at the &s;ame time confe&s;&s;ing to him that they had Robb'd the Subjects of the great <HI>Mogul,</HI> his Maje&s;ty's Alley.</P>
<P>That likewi&s;e his Lord&s;hip was well informed that <HI>William Nicolls,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of his Maje&s;ty's Council, by Profe&s;&s;ion a Lawyer, and therefore not ignorant of the Nature of Pyracy, had &s;o far betrayed the Tru&s;t his Maje&s;ty had repo&s;ed in him, as to make the bargain between the Pyrates and Coll <HI>Fletcher,</HI> (well knowing them to be Pyrats) and agreed with them on the Price they &s;hould give Coll. <HI>Fletcher</HI> for his Protections; for which his Service the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Nicolls</HI> had a Pre&s;ent made him of eight hundred Pieces of Eight. To prove which a Depo&s;ition was produced to his Lord&s;hip and Council, of <HI>Edward Taylor,</HI> one of the Pyrats who made the agreement with Coll. <HI>Fletcher</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nicolls.</HI> Which Depo&s;ition was very full to prove the &s;ame. And likewi&s;e &s;everal Original Protections as for Pyrats were produced, &s;igned and &s;ealed by Coll. <HI>Fletcher.</HI></P>
<P>That his Lord&s;hip e&s;teemed it a very great betraying of Tru&s;t both in Coll. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> the late Governour, who is now on ship board bound for <HI>England,</HI> as likewi&s;e of Mr. <HI>Nicolls,</HI> one of his Maje&s;ty's Council, now confined in the Fort, involv'd in the &s;ame Crime with him. That this is matter of State, and his Lord&s;hip de&s;ired their A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Opinion, what &s;hould be done therein for his Maje&s;ty's Service.</P>
<P>On this Mr. <HI>Nicolls</HI> was &s;ent for to appear before his Lord&s;hip and Council, and being charg'd by Mr. <HI>Weaver</HI> with the fore-going particulars, and having heard read the afore&s;aid Depo&s;ition of <HI>Edward Taylor,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nicolls</HI> for his Defence &s;aid, He knew no Per&s;ons that were Pyrats, nor did he know of any Contract made by Pyrats with Coll. <HI>Fletcher</HI>; but acknow|ledged that he had received the eight hundred Dollars from <HI>Edward Taylor</HI> for obtaining Protections and did believe he de&s;erved them for his pains and labour in &s;erving them. He likewi&s;e offered, That there is an Act of this Province that gave allowance to Privateers to come in and have Pro|tections, if they gave Security to the Government.</P>
<P>To this Mr. <HI>Weaver</HI> an&s;wered, That there was no &s;uch Act that gave any benefit to the&s;e Pyrats, and produced the Act in relation to Pyrats, and read part of it</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Weaver,</HI> by his Lord&s;hips order, acquainted the Council, That Capt <HI>Evans,</HI> Commander of his Maje&s;ties Ship, <HI>The Richmond,</HI> bound for <HI>England,</HI> had given in a Memorial to his Lord&s;hip, That be wanted forty Sailors, but acquainted his Lord&s;hip, that he could Man his Ship by Pyrats. His Lord&s;hip being &s;tartled thereat, told Capt. <HI>Evans,</HI> That he thought it dangerous to admit &s;o many Pyrats on board the Kings Ship, for that they might knock the Kings Sailors on the head, or joyn with them to run away with the Kings Ship. To which Capt. <HI>Evans</HI> replyed, He did not fear that. This di&s;cour&s;e was about the 18th of <HI>April</HI>: and four or five days after Capt. <HI>Evans</HI> came again to his Lord&s;hip, and de&s;ired an
<PB N="5" REF="000834_0004_0FABA12C21920E20">
Order for ten of Capt. <HI>Syms</HI> Saylors, affirming to his Lord&s;hip, that he had got thirty Volunteers on board, who would pay for their Pa&s;&s;age home for <HI>England.</HI> That his Lord&s;hips Jealou&s;ie being much increa&s;ed by the&s;e Di&s;courses of Capt. <HI>Evans,</HI> his Lord&s;hip ordered him to get ready to &s;ail, and when the Ship was ready, his Lord&s;hips Pacquets and Capt. <HI>Evans</HI> &s;ailing Orders &s;hould be ready. And &s;ome few days after Capt. <HI>Evans</HI> came to his Lord&s;hip, and told him, that he was ready, and would, with his Lord&s;hips leave, &s;ail to the Watering - place at <HI>Statten-I&s;land,</HI> and when watered would fall down to <HI>Sandy Hook,</HI> where he expected &s;ix or eight Sailors would come on board of him; and then Capt. <HI>Evans</HI> &s;aid he would wait on his Lord&s;hip at New-York, and receive his Pacquets and &s;ailing Orders</P>
<P>To the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es his Lord&s;hip offered his Oath voluntarily to the Council, that they were true. And to the two la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;es of thirty Volunteers on board that would pay for their Pa&s;&s;age home: and that &s;ix or eight Sailors would come on board at <HI>Sandy-Hook,</HI> Mr. <HI>VVeaver</HI> (who was pre&s;ent with his Lord&s;hip at the time of their being &s;poke) offered to atte&s;t.</P>
<P>That his Lord&s;hip (believing it not &s;afe to hazard the Kings Ship, and with de&s;ign to catch the &s;aid Pyrates (if on board) had this morning &s;ecur'd Cap. <HI>Evans</HI> in this Fort, and had given a Commi&s;&s;ion to Cap. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">iford,</HI> with nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tructions, and &s;everal Gentlemen, with forty armed Sailers were now &s;ent with him on board the <HI>Richmond,</HI> which his Lord&s;hip offered to the Con&s;ideration of the Council.</P>
<P>On which Captain <HI>Evans</HI> being called in before the Council, and charged with the aforegoing particulars, Capt. <HI>Evans</HI> ab&s;olutely deny'd that he had &s;aid to his Lord&s;hip that he would man his Ship with Pyrates, and &s;aid his Lord&s;hip had mi&s;taken him, for that he had only &s;aid he believed he could get &s;o many of the Privateers come in with Capt. <HI>Alli&s;on</HI> from <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> and likewi&s;e denyed all the other Speeches to be &s;aid by him, which were atte&s;ted by his Lord&s;hip; and Captain <HI>Evans</HI> prote&s;ted, that he had no Pyrate or Volunteer (to pay his pa&s;&s;age) on board the Kings Ship, nor would he &s;uffer any Pyrate to come on board the Ship, nor did he know of any that was to come on board. On which both Captain <HI>Evans</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nicolls</HI> were ordered to with|draw.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip then propo&s;ed to the Council that &s;ince the Infamy of Encouraging and Supporting Pyrates was laid on the City of <HI>New York,</HI> that it would be for the honour of the Government (what in them lay) to wipe off that &s;tain, and to publi&s;h a Proclamation forthwith concerning the horrid crime of Pyracy, and for the pro&s;ecuting and di&s;covery of Pyrates, to which the Council unanimou&s;ly a&s;&s;ented.</P>
<P>Then his Lordship de&s;ired the advice of the Council what Methods &s;hould be u&s;ed again&s;t Coll. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nicolls</HI> and Captain <HI>Evans,</HI> on this Emergency. Mr. <HI>Chidly Brooks</HI> &s;aid, that giving Protections to Pyrates hath not been looked upon formerly as &s;o great a matter, for that all the neighbouring Governments had done it commonly. To which his Lord&s;hip replyed, That Mr. <HI>Brooks</HI> might, if he plea&s;ed, think it a
<PB N="6" REF="000834_0005_0FABA12DAAA9D448">
Piccadillo but his Maje&s;ty and his Mini&s;ters at home e&s;teemed it as a high Offence, as might be perceived by the &s;trict In&s;tructions about it, that had been read to them. To which Mr. <HI>Brooke</HI> an&s;wered, That he would not excu&s;e it, but only &s;poke of what had been done.</P>
<P>The Council were of Opinion not one di&s;&s;enting, That the Depo&s;itions and Proofs again&s;t Coll. <HI>Fletcher</HI> &s;hould be taken, and &s;ealed with the Seal of the Province, and &s;ent home to the King with Coll. <HI>Fletcher</HI> a Pri&s;oner. But as for Mr. <HI>Nicolls</HI> they believed it proper he &s;hould be tryed here where the fact was committed, and not be &s;ent home, which would Ruin him, he having, (as they believed) no Money at home.</P>
<P>To which his Lord&s;hip replyed, That there was &s;o general a Corruption in this Province, and the People &s;o accu&s;tomed to the Profits of Pyrats, that they were apt to be almo&s;t in an Uproar on the Execution of the Laws; and that he did not know how far it was proper to bring this matter to a Tryal here; and that &s;ince Coll. <HI>Fletcher</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nicolls</HI> were both involved in the &s;ame Crime of Male-admini&s;tration of the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by his Maje&s;ty, it was his Lord&s;hips Opinion, that they &s;hould both be &s;ent home together, and be an&s;werable to his Maje&s;ty</P>
<P>Then Capt. <HI>Evans</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nicolls</HI> were again called in before the Council.</P>
<P>The Council were of Opinion that Mr <HI>Nicolls</HI> and Capt. <HI>Evans</HI> &s;hould give in Security for their Appearance, or continue confined.</P>
<P>And in pre&s;ence of the Council his Lord&s;hip admitted Mr. <HI>Nicolls</HI> to give in Security of Two Thou&s;and Pounds to appear when demanded; and admitted Capt. <HI>Evans</HI> his own Recognizance of one Thou&s;and Pounds to appear when demanded.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip thought fit to &s;u&s;pend Mr. <HI>Nicolls</HI> from being one of his Maje&s;ties Council, until his Maje&s;ties further plea&s;ure be known therein.</P>
<P>And on the fore-going Recognizances Capt. <HI>Evans</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nicolls</HI> were di&s;charged of their Confinement.</P>
