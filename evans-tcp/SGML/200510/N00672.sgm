<P>ONE of the mo&s;t lively &s;imilitudes under which the life of a Believer is expre&s;t and &s;et forth, is that or a <HI>warfare,</HI> which is a life not of ea&s;e and idle|ne&s;s, but attended with many hazzards, and hard|&s;hips, and which every Chri&s;tian mu&s;t endeavous <HI>to endure as a good Souldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> As a Souldier conver&s;es with many dangers and diffi|culties, and dwells as it were continually in the very Territories of Death, and the Grave; &s;o the life of a Chri&s;tian is &s;o full either of vi&s;ible or in|vi&s;ible difficulties, temptations, and dangerous a&s;|&s;aults, with which he mu&s;t enter the li&s;ts, and is expo&s;ed to encounter; as that he may be &s;aid dayly to pa&s;s the <HI>Pikes,</HI> and for to carry his <HI>Soul continually in his hand.</HI> The Devil the Captain ge|neral

and commander of the black Regiment of Hell, is re&s;tle&s;s in his attempts; like him (who whether conquered or did conquer) was never quiet: if &s;o be either by him&s;elf or his in&s;tru|ments, he may &s;wallow us up, and utterly de&s;troy us. The <HI>World,</HI> the <HI>men</HI> of it; &s;ome of the&s;e are the <HI>Militia</HI> and <HI>Auxiliaries</HI> of Satan, Enemies to the truth, and therefore continually oppo&s;ing, both it, and its profe&s;&s;ors: and as for the <HI>things</HI> of the world, the honours, plea&s;ures and profits of it, the&s;e have their &s;nares, and &s;tratagems. And as by the flatteries and allurements of the&s;e, the De|vil would fain have overcome our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Captain Him&s;elf: So al&s;o by the &s;ame, would he fain over-come tho&s;e that are his followers, and who have li&s;ted them&s;elves un|der that Captain. But be&s;ides the many forreign, a Chri&s;tian hath many inbred and dome&s;tick ad|ver&s;aries; <HI>We have enemies of our own hou&s;e</HI>: there are not only the temptations of the Devil, the op|po&s;itions of the world, which we have to conflict with; but there are al&s;o the <HI>lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h.</HI> The holie&s;t man that ever trode upon the face of the earth, (except the Son of Man, that Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who was not a meer man, but the eternal Son of God, <HI>and God manife&s;t in the fle&s;h</HI>) ex|cept him, that be&s;t of Men, that ever ble&s;t the earth with their re&s;idence upon it, have had fle&s;h lu&s;ting in them, unto &s;in; and &s;ometimes leading them into Captivity, and making them <HI>bond &s;laves

for a &s;ea&s;on</HI>: and this enemy is more frequent &amp; con&s;tant in his a&s;&s;aults and bickerings, than a Chri&s;tians other enemies. If his forreign or ex|ternal enemies, do at any time &s;tand &s;till, <HI>Sin,</HI> that treacherous inmate and cur&s;ed adver&s;ary, will rare|ly give him any truce or re&s;pit at all. If there be a ce&s;&s;ation (for a time) of the former, he can &s;carce pa&s;s an hour without many fights and skir|mages with the latter. As therefore a good Soul|dier mu&s;t not &s;pare &s;o much as one enemy, when he hath &s;uch a command and commi&s;&s;ion given him: &s;o a Chri&s;tian mu&s;t not &s;pare &s;o much as any one iniquity or lu&s;t; his orders from his great Commander &amp; Lawgiver are &s;o: but he mu&s;t in|deavour the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing, beating down and con|quering the &s;ame. And how &s;trong &amp; &s;trenuous the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was (who frequently &s;peaks of him&s;elf as a Souldier, not only as he was a Mini|&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, but al&s;o as he was a Chri&s;tian: I &s;ay how &s;trong and &s;trenuous he was,) <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his Spiritual warfare in general, &s;o in particular in beating down his internal Enemies; <HI>Sin &amp; Lu&s;t</HI>: we &s;hall &s;ee if we reflect a little upon the latter part of the Chapter before us, &amp; particularly the words that have been read unto you. The Apo&s;tle have|ing in the former part of the Chapter, been de|claring his liberty in reference to <HI>Marriage</HI>; as al&s;o his requiring of <HI>Maintenance</HI> of them among whom he had been labouring in the work of the Mini&s;try: and yet how he had abridg'd him&s;elf, &amp;

forborn to u&s;e the &s;ame, that &s;o he might not be over-burden-&s;ome to them; nor hinder the pro|gre&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s of the Go&s;pel among them: he doth in the latter part of the Chapter, particularly at the 24. <HI>v.</HI> endeavour to pre&s;s his former di&s;cour&s;e, by telling them the difficulties of getting to Hea|ven, and al&s;o the obligation they lay under to run in that race, and to contend in <HI>that warfare,</HI> that would bring them thereto. The method cho&s;en by the Apo&s;tle to do this in, is borrowing an Ele|gant &s;imilitude from &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Games</HI> the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> and <HI>Corinthians</HI> were wont to divert and ex|erci&s;e them&s;elves in.

And that he might further prevail with them &s;o to <HI>Run, as to win the prize,</HI> &s;o to <HI>Fight the good fight, as to obtain the crown</HI>; he &s;ets before them the examples not only of other <HI>runners</HI> and <HI>wre&s;tlers,</HI> who were wont to be care|full and painfull, in dieting and ordering them|&s;elves before, and &s;training and putting them&s;elves forth to the utmo&s;t in their race &amp; combat (tho' the crown and garland for which they &s;trove, was

mean and incon&s;iderable, (yea nothing) compar'd with that, which the Apo&s;tle with tho&s;e to whom he &s;pake, laboured and contended for; the for|mer being a corruptible, the latter a crown that is incorruptible) I &s;ay, the Apo&s;tle doth not only &s;et before them the examples of tho&s;e <HI>Game&s;ters,</HI> to pre&s;s them to their duty. But he al&s;o propo&s;es to them his own example, telling them what he him|&s;elf <HI>did,</HI> and al&s;o would <HI>doe.</HI> Like the valiant Commander, who doth not &s;ay to his Souldiers (in an arduous and difficult encounter) <HI>Ite illuc, goe forth thither,</HI> as if they were to go forth upon Service, and he tarry behind in his Tent; but <HI>Venite huc, come ye hither, follow me, you &s;hall go no further, than I will venture my own life.</HI> The Apo&s;tle knew full well, that tho&s;e that are indi&s;|po&s;ed &amp; uninclined to duty; if tho&s;e that dictate duty to them, and exhort them to the performance of it, are &s;lothful &amp; negligent in duty them&s;elves, (I &s;ay) he knew full well, how that tho&s;e that are uninclined and indi&s;pos'd to duty, might be ready to alledge the old proverb, <HI>Phy&s;ician, heal thy &s;elf: Thou that teachest another, teache&s;t thou not thy &s;elf.</HI> To anticipate therefore, &amp; prevent eve|ry thing of this nature, and to draw them to be active, indu&s;trious and very diligent in their Spiri|tual warfare, he tells them, he ran in the &s;ame Spiritual race with them, contended in the &s;ame Spiritual warfare, that he was their fellow Souldier; and gave them no other advice than he him&s;elf

<P>In the words of our Text, we have the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erting and declaring, how he fought, and be|hav'd him&s;elf, in his Spiritual warfare; and this the Apo&s;tle lays down,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Negatively. So fight I, as one not beating the air.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Po&s;itively. But I keep under my body, and bring it into &s;ubjection.</HI> Where we have,</P>
<P N="1">1. The object, or enemy that he encountred or combated with: in tho&s;e words, <HI>My Body.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The act, or manner how he manag'd him|&s;elf towards that object, or enemy; and this is expre&s;t by two terms. (1.) <HI>I keep under my body.</HI> (2.) <HI>I bring it into &s;ubjection.</HI></P>
<P><HI>So Fight I, not as one that beateth the Air, but I keep under my body.</HI> He fought but it was <HI>not as one that beateth the air.</HI> He did not act like a young Fencer, making only a flouri&s;h, and beating only the air; but he fought in good earne&s;t, and beat his adver&s;aries, (The Enemies of his Salvation)</P>
<P><HI>My Body.</HI>] Body is not to be taken here, &s;o much in a Phy&s;ical, as in a Moral &s;ence. We are not to under&s;tand by his body, only the Apo&s;tles fle&s;hly part, that part of him which con&s;i&s;ted of fle&s;h and bones (which, body, is put in Scripture &s;ometimes to &s;ignify) but by his body we are to under&s;tand, be&s;ides his outward man, his <HI>Sin</HI>; that which the Apo&s;tle el&s;e where calls, <HI>the body of Sin.

<P>Conclu&s;ion 1. <HI>Man naturally is in league and cor|re&s;pondence with Sin.</HI> As he came out of the hands of his Maker, he was in league &amp; corre&s;pondence with him. Man was Gods friend: but &s;ince we have broke our league, and forfeited our corre&s;|pondence with God; a quarrel is commenced be|tween God and us: we have entred into a league and have kept up a corre&s;pondence with Gods greate&s;t enemy; this amity and friend&s;hip, and the natural man is very near and intimate; it is got into every part of our Souls, it is become our near Neighbour, and we naturally love it as our &s;elves; yea we are naturally under the dominion and power of &s;in: Sin <HI>rules</HI> and <HI>reigns</HI> in the na|tural man; he is its &s;lave and va&s;&s;el: is as the A|po&s;tle &s;peaks, and it is a truth, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.19. <HI>Of whom a man is overcome, of the &s;ame is he brought into bondage.</HI> Then every natural man being daily o|vercome and ma&s;tered by his lu&s;ts &amp; corruptions, he mu&s;t needs be in &s;ervitude, &s;lavery and bondage to them: nor needs there much adoe to overcome him; he is naturally willing to obey &s;in, and &s;o is a Servant of it, as the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.16. <HI>Know you not that to whom ye yield your &s;elves &s;ervants to obey, his &s;ervants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of &s;in unto death,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="000816_0013_0FAA569D59EA6258">Conclu&s;ion 2. <HI>When a man li&s;ts him&s;elf under the banner of Chri&s;t, he then breaks his league and corre&s;|pondence <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, and proclaims a War with it.</HI> We cannot give up our &s;elves to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and be faithful in his Service, unle&s;s we renounce the Service of Sin, and wage and maintain an irre|concilable War with that. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and this <HI>Mam|mon</HI> are &s;uch different ma&s;ters <HI>(Captains)</HI> as that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a man to march under and &s;erve them both. There mu&s;t be a for&s;aking of the latter if we would cleave to the former. The Apo&s;tle tells us, <HI>Jam.</HI> 4&punc; 4. <HI>The friend&s;hip of the world is enmity with God: and who&s;oever will be a friend of the world, is an enemy of God.</HI> It is true of &s;in and wordly lu&s;ts, that tho&s;e that are in friend|&s;hip with them are enemies of God and Chri&s;t; they wage War again&s;t Heaven, and bid open de|fiance to the Lord of Ho&s;ts. <HI>Well,</HI> but the friend|&s;hip of God and Chri&s;t is enmity with &s;in and worldly lu&s;ts; and who&s;oever will be a friend of Chri&s;t, will be an enemy of &s;in; he hath broke his league with it, and wages War again&s;t it: as when a league and Alliance between two Princes is broken, a War is wont to en&s;ue and follow. If therefore indeed we have been brought to en|gage our &s;elves to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to &s;erve him in the War again&s;t our Spiritual enemies, we have been brought to &s;ee &s;in to be an enemy, and a treacherous one al&s;o. That which hath been wont to on&s;nare, and lead us Captive, and we have
<PB N="15" REF="000816_0014_0FAA569DFB52B8C8">
ca&s;t off its Service, and are re&s;olved to live in per|petual Ho&s;tility with it.</P>
<P>Conclu&s;ion 3. <HI>As when a man li&s;ts him&s;elf under the banner of Chri&s;t, he breaks his league and corre&s;|pondence with Sin, and proclaims a War with it; &s;o he hath had a mortal wound given to the habit of it by the Spirit of God.</HI> When a man voluntarily of|fers him&s;elf to the Service of Chri&s;t, upon his pro|clamation &amp; call, (I &s;ay) when a man is brought effectually to an&s;wer that call; as he renounces his corre&s;pondence with &s;in, and enters upon a War with it; &s;o, there is by the Spirit of God, a deadly blow given to the old man, our habit of &s;in. However in a mans natural e&s;tate he is un|der the dominion of &s;in. Yet when Grace comes into a man, the Spirit of God which is &s;tronger than that &s;trong man armed, comes upon him, overcomes him, and takes from him his armour wherein he tru&s;ted. Every one that doth indeed actually belong to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is freed from the reigning power and dominion of &s;in: that is accompli&s;hed in him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.12, 14. <HI>That &s;in hath not dominion over him: and &s;in &s;hall not reign in his mortal body, that he &s;hould obey it in the lu&s;ts thereof.</HI> The Spirit of God hath &s;poiled &s;in of its power and dominion, and given it its Deaths wound. An unregenerate mans heart is Sins Ter|ritory: Sin is in &s;uch a mans heart as in its Throne, before the Spirit comes, but when that comes, and by that the nature is changed and renewed;
<PB N="16" REF="000816_0015_0FAA569EBAB436A8">
Sin is ca&s;t out of its Throne, and condemned to die.</P>
<P>Conclu&s;ion 4. <HI>Though a mortal wound be given by the Spirit of God to the habit of Sin, when a man Li&s;ts him&s;elf under the banner of Christ, yet Sin is not then quite overcome and de&s;troyed in a man</HI>: However Grace doth really &s;ubdue Sin, yet it does not wholly de&s;troy Sin. Though it doth really purify a mans nature, yet in this life it doth not quite perfect his nature. A Chri&s;tian mu&s;t not expect to experience a &s;tate of perfecti|on here in this life: No, that e&s;tate is re&s;erved till he comes to experience a &s;tate of Glory. The be&s;t of men in this life have a double nature in them, as we may &s;ee of man in general, that he con&s;i&s;ts of Body &amp; Soul; &s;o we may &s;ay of every Godly Man (in a <HI>Theological</HI> &s;en&s;e) that he hath both Fle&s;h and Spirit, Corruption as well as Grace. Though Sin be beat out of its &s;trong holds, yet it hath betaken it &s;elf to its inward Ca&s;tle, where it will remain and have a being in us, as long as we &s;hall have a being here in this world. This <HI>Canaanite</HI> will dwell in the Land, nor can the Children of God drive it out of this City. God doth with us, in re&s;pect of Sin, (our inward E|nemy) as the P&s;almi&s;t prayed again&s;t his out|ward Enemies, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 59.11. <HI>Slay them not, &s;catter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our Shield.</HI> Thus doth the Lord do in re&s;pect of Sin, and Corruption in his Saints here in this

World; tho&s;e enemies are brought down from that power and dignity, in which they were wont to be, but they are nor wholly &s;lain. They are &s;urrounded, are taken, arraigned, a Sentence of death is pa&s;t upon them, and they are dead in Law, but yet they have their lives lengthened out for a &s;ea&s;on during our bodily life, nor can we till the death of the Body, expect perfectly to be freed from the body of death. The wi&s;e man proclaims a Challenge to all the world, to enter the Li&s;ts with him upon this account, <HI>Prov.</HI> 20.9. <HI>Who can &s;ay, I have made mine heart clean?</HI> And though there may be &s;ome of man-kind, that may fal&s;ely and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly &s;ay that they have; yet none can truly and &s;afely &s;ay that they have: <HI>For if we &s;ay we have no &s;in, we de|ceive our &s;elves, and the truth is not in us</HI>: 1 Joh. 1.8.</P>
<P>Conclu&s;ion 5. <HI>Sin not being thus quite overcome and de&s;troyed; it follows that every man, who hath li&s;ted him&s;elf under the banner of Chri&s;t, hath a diver|&s;ity of principles in him, between which there can be no amity and friend&s;hip, but on the other hand a con|tinual warring.</HI> The principles, Sin and Grace, Fle&s;h and Spirit are diametrically oppo&s;ite one unto another, are the greate&s;t contraries in the whole world, as contrary as light and darkne&s;s, as life and death, as good and evil, as Heaven and Hell. And being &s;o oppo&s;ite and contrary, they cannot be dormant, and latitant in the Soul, but

They lie intrencht and engaged one again&s;t the other. As long as a man keeps his league with &s;in and &s;erves that, he feels nothing at all of this: <HI>While the &s;trong man armed keeps the Palace, his goods are in peace.</HI> Luk. 11.21. As long as <HI>I&s;rael</HI> is &s;ubject to the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and doth their drudgery, all is well, there's no &s;tir; but when once they &s;hake off that Servitude, and &s;et out for <HI>Canaan,</HI> then they are pur&s;ued with all the forces and powers imaginable, to be brought back to their former bondage.

<P>This Enemy is always pre&s;ent with us, it incamps in us, round about us, and doth <HI>mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et us,</HI> Heb. 12.1.

A Chri&s;tian may &s;ometimes be foiled, and &s;eem to be beaten back, but yet he &s;hall recover him&s;elf again; though he fall yet he &s;hall ri&s;e again: It may be &s;aid of him, as of <HI>God, Gen.</HI> 49.19 <HI>Though a Troop may over|come him, yet he &s;hall overcome at la&s;t.</HI> And as this Victory is mo&s;t certain, &s;o it is mo&s;t &s;ignal and glorious, the Victory it &s;elf is mo&s;t &s;ignal and glorious, and &s;o is the Reward of it. The Vict|ory it &s;elf is &s;o, it's a greater conque&s;t than to be Conqueror of the World; for &s;ome that have been Conquerors of the World&punc; have yet been taken Captives by their own lu&s;ts and affections, <HI>Prov.</HI> 16.32. <HI>He that is &s;low to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a City</HI>: he that ruleth his Spirit is better and more victorious and more glorious. This is the noble&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ignal victory, &amp; the Reward al&s;o is mo&s;t &s;ignal &amp; glorious, it being no le&s;s than a Crown, not of &s;ilver or gold, but of Eternal Life; if we through the grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tances of the Spirit, do kill and put to death the deeds of the Body, we &s;hall live eternally, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.13. Let

then the con&s;ideration hereof incourage us to our Duty. For <HI>Direction</HI> take a few particulars briefly.</P>
<P>Direction 1. <HI>Begin with this enemy betimes</HI>; cru&s;h it in the fir&s;t motions of it, it's ea&s;ie&s;t over|coming at the fir&s;t. Warriors are wont to &s;et upon their enemies, where they find them feeble&s;t; &s;o we &s;hould &s;et upon &s;in before it get head, and if we do, before it get too much hold upon our faculties, or break forth by outward acts, we may more ea&s;ily &s;ubdue it, and hold it under, as a &s;lave and va&s;&s;al. The&s;e Lions, we may more ea&s;ily conquer and tame if we &s;et upon them while they are Whelps, whereas if we let them grow up as in a little time they will, to be &s;alvage bea&s;ts, we &s;hall find them very formidable, if not unconquerable. As &s;oon therefore as we find this enemy to rebel, and to begin to War, let us ri&s;e up in Arms again&s;t it, and endeavour by force of the &s;ame, to quell it and bring it into &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>Direction. 2. <HI>Hold no parley with this Enemy</HI>; it is &s;o treacherous as that we had need awe our &s;elves with a fear of being en&s;nared by it, and therefore mu&s;t avoid all occa&s;ions of it. Keep out of the way of its temptations. Its excellent advice, <HI>Prov.</HI> 4.14, 15. <HI>Enter not into the path of the
<PB N="32" REF="000816_0031_0FAA56ADC0B3D328">
wicked, and go not in the way of evil men, avoid it, pa&s;s not by it, turn from it, and pa&s;s away.</HI> This enemy will &s;ay to us as <HI>Jael</HI> to <HI>Si&s;era, Turn in, Turn in to me, fear not</HI>; but if we do hearken to its Sollicitations, it hath a <HI>Nail</HI> to &s;trike into our Temples, and be the death of us. It will take us as <HI>Joah</HI> did <HI>Abner</HI> by the beard, as if it would imbrace us; but if we take no heed, it will &s;mite us under the <HI>fifth Rib,</HI> and &s;hed out our bowels to the earth. It will come and ki&s;s us as <HI>Judas</HI> did our Saviour, when as with him, it hath been plotting nothing le&s;s than the betraying us into our enemies hand: we mu&s;t therefore hold no parly with it, nor come any nearer than needs mu&s;t to any of its quarters. Nor will it be ca&s;t upon us in the day of Judgment, as a piece of Cowardi&s;e, thus to retreat from our enemy, but will be reckoned our greate&s;t valour and courage: It is the true&s;t <HI>Magnanimity</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>Heroick</HI> valour, in our Spiritual warfare, to be afraid of the lea&s;t iniquity, <HI>Happy is the man that thus feareth always.</HI></P>
<P>Direction. 3. <HI>Cut off all the provi&s;ions and &s;up|plies of Sin</HI>; this is the Apo&s;tles advice, Rom. 13.14 <HI>To make no provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</HI> If we would ever &s;ubdue our Lu&s;ts, and be the death of them, we mu&s;t cut off all the provi&s;ion, which hath a tendency to &s;up|port them and keep them alive. It is counted
<PB N="33" REF="000816_0032_0FAA56B007E01148">
excellent policy in War, to leave as little pro|vi&s;ion as may be in the Enemies way. It's be&s;t to burn it, and de&s;troy it, though it be in our own Country, if otherwi&s;e, it will have a tendency to relieve and &s;upport our enemies. Thus mu&s;t we endeavour to weaken the force of Sin, even this way; we mu&s;t &s;et a guard over our affections, and inferiour appetites; lay every thing under bonds, that we are in &s;u&s;picion, will take part with the enemy: En|deavour the utter con&s;umption of what&s;oever would be like provi&s;ion to our Lu&s;ts, to &s;up|port them and keep them alive. We mu&s;t endeavour to &s;tarve our Lu&s;ts, and if we afford them no &s;u&s;tenance, but endeavour to deprive them of every thing or that nature, we may hope that they cannot hold out long, but mu&s;t &s;urrender, and acknowledge them&s;elves conquered.</P>
<P>Direction 4. <HI>Improve all the weapons that the Chri&s;tian Armour will afford you.</HI> This armour con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal pieces. We have a li&s;t of them. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.13, 14. And we mu&s;t not content our &s;elves with one or two pieces of this armour, but we mu&s;t <HI>put on the whole armour of God.</HI> E&s;pecially of all the pieces of armour; we mu&s;t &s;ee to it, not to forget the <HI>Sword</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which is the word of God; of this Sword, we may truly &s;ay as <HI>David</HI> did of
<PB N="34" REF="000816_0033_0FAA56B138CCC968">
<HI>Goliahs, there's none like it.</HI> It is a two edged Sword, to cut the <HI>Nerves</HI> and <HI>Sinews</HI> of Sin a&s;under. And <HI>Pray always</HI>: this is not only a part of our Chri&s;tian armour, but it is that which helps us, by which we are inabled to make a right improvement of all the re&s;t: this is nece&s;&s;ary all along through the whole of our encounter with the body of &s;in. We mu&s;t therefore endeavour to manage this <HI>with|out cea&s;ing,</HI> we mu&s;t be continually lifting up our hearts and eyes to God; and when ever an army of Temptations doth a&s;&s;ault us, &s;ay with <HI>Jeho&s;aphat</HI> 2 Chorn. 20.12. <HI>O&punc; our God we have no might again&s;t this great Company that cometh again&s;t us, neither know we what to do, but our eyes are unto thee.</HI> This is the way to fetch Chri&s;t into the field, and battel, for our help, and then we may be &s;ure of defence and protection, yea, of Victory and Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Direction 5. <HI>In the Combat with Sin, aim principally at the General of tho&s;e Enemies</HI>: I mean your beloved darling Iniquity; plant your main Artilery again&s;t that, thats the <HI>Goliah</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Phili&s;tins</HI>; a mans darling Sin is a captain &s;in: that bears the authority in the Soul, and his other &s;ins are under it as Souldiers; it &s;aving to one, <HI>Go, and it gos,</HI> and to another, <HI>Come, and it comes</HI>; a mans other Sins are &s;ub|&s;ervient unto this&punc; This is the &s;in that is &s;o
<PB N="35" REF="000816_0034_0FAA56B2773F3428">
much tended and waited on. Now if we would keep under tho&s;e enemies and bring them into &s;ubjection, we mu&s;t endeavour primarily and principally to de&s;troy this principal of them; as it was &s;aid to them, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 22.31. <HI>Fight neither with &s;mall nor great, &s;ave only with the King of I&s;rael.</HI> So &s;ay I, fight neither again&s;t &s;mall nor great Sins comparatively, but again&s;t this kingly, this ma&s;ter enemy; bind this &s;trong man, and you will ea&s;ily take the hou&s;e. Slay but this Champion, and the re&s;t will flee, as we read of the <HI>Phili&s;tins,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 17.51. <HI>When they &s;aw that their Champion was dead, they fled.</HI></P>
<P>Direction 6. <HI>When you think you have attain|ed any Victory or Conque&s;t over Sin, take heed of Security.</HI> Though the Enemy may be quiet, yet fear lea&s;t he &s;hould not be quite routed; therefore be always upon your watch, ready to with&s;tand a fre&s;h a&s;&s;ault: Let every day be a day for the training and exerci&s;ing of all your graces; have them always in Battel array: See that they be continually in a Military po&s;ture, and &s;et an exact guard upon your hearts, that &s;o when ever your affections move or &s;tir un&s;ea|&s;onably or di&s;orderly, they may be made to &s;tand, not let to pa&s;s, till we know from whence they come, and whither they tend; did we do &s;o, in what excellent order might we have, and keep our Souls?</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="000816_0035_0FAA56B3094ED3E8">Direction 7. <HI>Do what you do in this Combate, not in your own, but in the &s;trength of your Great Commander.</HI> If ever we would &s;torm and beat down the &s;trong holds that are within us, it mu&s;t be by the concurrence of Divine Grace; <HI>the Weapons of our warfare are mighty through God,</HI> 2 Cor. 10.4. we come to be <HI>more than conquerors through him that loved us, Rom.</HI> 8.37. This Ene|my will fling us down as fa&s;t as we can ri&s;e, if we encounter it in our own &s;trength; if there|fore we would beat it down, we mu&s;t &s;ay when we Encounter it, as <HI>David</HI> to the <HI>Phili&s;tin,</HI> 1 Sam. 17.45. <HI>I come unto thee in the name of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the God of the Armies of I&s;rael, whom thou ha&s;t defied. A&s;a,</HI> when he had a va&s;t Army of Two Hundred and Four&s;core Thou&s;and, Migh|ty men of Valour, to fight with the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> he prays and tru&s;ts to God as if he had not one man. 2 Chron. 15.11. <HI>Help us O Lord our God, for we Re&s;t on thee, and in thy Name do we go a|gain&s;t this multitude.</HI> So mu&s;t we &s;ay when a&s;|&s;aulted with Sin, Help us O Lord our God, for we have no power again&s;t the &s;ame, but do re&s;t on thee; God is able to make us &s;tand again&s;t Sin; <HI>Through him we may do valiantly</HI>: P&s;al. 60.12. <HI>he is the Lord, &s;trong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battel,</HI> P&s;al. 24.8. Though the arch|ers may &s;orely grieve us, and &s;hoot at us, yet
<PB N="37" REF="000816_0036_0FAA56B3DB139460">
he can make our Bow to abide in &s;trength, and the arms of our hands may be made &s;trong by the Hands of the mighty God of <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen. 49.23, 24.</P>
<P>Direction 8. <HI>In the &s;trength of your great Cap|tain, endeavour to per&s;evere and hold out to the end.</HI> The Crown is at the end of the Warfare, it is not wont to be given till the Victory is gain|ed, the promi&s;e is not to him that begins, but to him that overcomes. Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t our great Captain, went forth conque|ring to conquer; and however we may pre|tend to be his Souldiers, yet we &s;hall never obtain the Crown, unle&s;s we endeavour in our mea&s;ure to imitate him in this regard. O then let us all endeavour to be faithful to the death, that &s;o we may receive the Crown of life; and it is but a little while, that we have thus to engage and combate with &s;in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> if we are faithful in the Service, and hold out, e're long we &s;hall have done fight|ing, and &s;hall come to triumphing; We &s;hall put off our armour, and put on a victorious Crown. The Great Lord of Ho&s;ts, under who&s;e Banner we fight, within a little time will remove our Quarters, he will draw us off from the Army Militant, here upon earth, to the ble&s;&s;ed and triumphant in Heaven.
<PB N="38" REF="000816_0037_0FAA56B4779BC760">
Then we &s;hall be out of Gun &s;hot, &s;hall never be any more annoyed, mole&s;ted, or di&s;turbed with the body of &s;in, but &s;hall be perfectly freed from it, made perfect in Holine&s;s, and &s;hall for ever be giving thanks and &s;inging the prai&s;es of that God, <HI>who giveth as the Victory, through our LORD JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Amen.</HI></HI></P>
