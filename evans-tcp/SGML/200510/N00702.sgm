<HEAD>His Excellency's Speech to the General A&s;&s;embly.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THere had been no occa&s;ion for calling you at this time, if the la&s;t A&s;|&s;embly had an&s;wered the good ends I propo&s;ed to my &s;elf for the Kings Service, and that of the Province. But having &s;ate a whole Moneth and done no bu&s;ine&s;s, I thought it advi&s;eable to Di&s;&s;olve them; and the rather, becau&s;e there were great Heats and Divi&s;ions among them, which I found Impracticable for me to compo&s;e and put an end to.</P>
<P>You need not be told to what a degree Faction and Sedition have taken Root in this Town, 'tis a thing &s;o generally known. And there has been the utmo&s;t Indu&s;try us'd by &s;ome ill Men to &s;pread the Infection all over the Province, and to alienate the Affections of the People by fal&s;e Sugge&s;tions and Notions of their Independance from the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and that 'tis a Violence and Wrong done 'em that <HI>England</HI> &s;hould put a Limitation on their Trade. How extravagant and wild is this Notion; does not <HI>England</HI> put a Re&s;triction on its own Trade, in &s;ome Ca&s;es? And as for <HI>Pyracy,</HI> which &s;ome People are &s;o fond of here, 'tis held in &s;uch Abomination as not to be known or practis'd there. People mu&s;t not be &s;o deceived, this Province is &s;ubject to the Crown of <HI>England</HI>; and 'tis its greate&s;t Glory and Happine&s;s that it is &s;o. For by that means the People are entituled to the Protection of the Crown, and are under the be&s;t Con&s;titution of Laws, and that in fellow&s;hip with the be&s;t and brave&s;t People in the World, the People of <HI>England</HI>; and they mu&s;t be obedient to <HI>Engli&s;h Laws,</HI> 'tis their Duty and Intere&s;t &s;o to be. And the Angry Men of <HI>New-York</HI> mu&s;t not expect from me that Connivance at their ill Practices that they were accu&s;tomed to &s;ome years before my coming to the Government: The Oath of a Governour, the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and the King's In&s;tructions, which are made to &s;quare with the Laws, are &s;acred Tyes and Obligations with me.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erv'd great Marks of Irreligion and Immorality in this place, and I take it to proceed from a long Habit of breaking the Laws, which has intro|duced Li&s;entious and Di&s;&s;olute Living: And nothing can rectifie and reform our Lives &amp; Manners but Religion. <HI>Religion</HI> is of that admirable frame and temper, it inflames us with a true Devotion to our great Maker, which is our mo&s;t rea&s;onable Service. Then it fits us for all the ends of Civil Society, by uniting our Minds, Affections and Intere&s;ts; it makes us good Men: And good Men will of cour&s;e be good Friends, good Neighbours good Subjects; &amp; good Patriots, that is, Lovers of their Country, and obedient to its Laws.</P>
<P>Now that I have &s;tated to you the unhappy Circum&s;tances we are in by the contrivance of ill Men. I &s;hall proceed to recommend to your Thoughts a few things which are nece&s;&s;ary for the Support and Peace of the Government, and will be a manife&s;tation of your Duty and Affection to the KING.</P>
<P>I therefore Propo&s;e to you Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, the Continuance of the pre&s;ent Revenue (which will otherwi&s;e &s;hortly expire) for what Number of Years you &s;hall think fit. I found the Government very con&s;iderably indebted when I came to it, and it cannot be expected that Debt &s;hould be much le&s;&s;en'd in &s;o &s;hort a time as I have been here: And I could wi&s;h you would put the Government on a clear foot, by finding a way to
<PB N="3" REF="000848_0003_0FABA13D5E868B70">
di&s;charge that Debt. The Publick Accounts I have order'd to be prepar'd for you, with an e&s;timate of the Debts of the Government. I promi&s;e you I will be as good a Husband of your Money as 'tis po&s;&s;ible for me to be: and when 'tis either mi&s;-apply'd or mi&s;-mannag'd by my means, I &s;hall not take it ami&s;s if you put me in mind of my want of Care therein. To induce you to the continuance of the Revenue to the Crown, I cannot &s;et before your Eye a better Example than that of the great and glorious People of <HI>England,</HI> who out of a &s;ence of the ine&s;timable Advantages they were re&s;tor'd to by the King, freely, and without the lea&s;t murmuring, &s;upported him in a long and expen&s;ive War, well knowing he bravely fought for the Liberties of all the Chri&s;tian World, and that they had as great a &s;hare as any others in that Quarrel; wherein al&s;o his Maje&s;ty often ventur'd his Royal Per&s;on with the meane&s;t Souldier in his Armies. Be&s;ide, the King con&s;idering this Province as a Barrier between the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> and his other Plantations, and there|fore mo&s;t expos'd, was pleas'd to take a peculiar Care of you, having been at great Expence this la&s;t War, in paying for four Hundred Men, and maintain|ing a Man of War for your Defence, and con&s;tantly &s;upplying you with Stores of War. The&s;e are &s;uch Obligations as I hope you will not only remember in the manner I have now recommended, but al&s;o with your earne&s;t Prayers to God for his Maje&s;ties long Life and pro&s;perous Reign over you</P>
<P>The next thing I recommend to you, is the Reconciling of People and Parties, which will be a glorious Work, and will, I doubt not, be ea&s;ily accom|pli&s;h'd by your prudent Care. You all know the Mi&s;chiefs, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th publick and private, that Feuds and Divi&s;ions bring on a People or Nation: they cau&s;e an Interruption in Trade, by the Di&s;cord they make in private Families &amp; Friend|&s;hips: and next to a Civil War, 'tis the mo&s;t Unhappy &s;tate and Condition a Country can be in. I will heartily joyn with you in &s;uch Methods as &s;hall be thought advi&s;eable for the procurement of a thorow Reconciliation of Parties. And that you may induce others to be peaceably and charitably minded, I earne&s;tly recommend to you, Gentlemen Repre&s;entatives, that you mannage your Debates &amp; Proceedings in your Hou&s;e with that Calmne&s;s and Moderation that becomes the Prudence of Men, that are under &s;uch a Tru&s;t from their Country. The pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent Conjuncture requires it at your hands; The King will thank you, the World will applaud you for it, and God will ble&s;s and pro&s;per you and your Affairs.</P>
<P>I mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t acquaint you with the Circum&s;tances of our five Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> with whom I had a Conference this la&s;t Summer at <HI>Albany</HI>&punc; &amp; then fix't their Friend&s;hip &amp; Fidelity to the Crown by extraordinary Pre&s;ents &amp; kind U&s;age; and they parted with me in all the good Humor imaginable. But I am lately advi&s;ed they are grown very unea&s;ie and di&s;&s;atisfied at the <HI>French</HI> Governour of <HI>Canada's</HI> detaining &s;ome of their Friends Pri&s;oners, notwith&s;tanding the late Treaty of Peace, which is a very unfair Practice in that Governour. You &s;hall have all the Memorials and Proceedings with our Indians laid before you that you may advi&s;e me what mea&s;ures to take for pre&s;erving them firm to the Intere&s;t of the Crown and this Province, which is a thing of very great con|&s;equence, and de&s;erves as much as any thing what&s;oever to be the &s;ubject of your Thoughts and Determination</P>
<P>I am ordered by the Kings In&s;tructions to prepare and offer you 2 or 3 Bills
<PB N="4" REF="000848_0004_0FABA1586CA86368">
for your pa&s;&s;ing, which will be for the Service of the Province. And &s;uch other Bills as you &s;hall judge proper to offer me for &s;ecuring your Liberties, and advancing your Trade, I promi&s;e you my a&s;&s;ent to their pa&s;&s;ing into Laws, provided they be not Repugnant to the Laws and Intere&s;t of <HI>England.</HI></P>
