<P>As an In&s;tance of <HI>Spiritual Plagues,</HI> The <HI>Ora|cles</HI> of God, have often told us, That <HI>Some Sins,</HI> are not only <HI>Con&s;equents,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>Puni&s;hments</HI> of <HI>others.</HI> To this purpo&s;e, we have that famous pa&s;&s;age, in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 6.10. where, the people who had &s;infully <HI>Stopt</HI> their <HI>Ears,</HI> and <HI>Shut</HI> their <HI>Eyes,</HI> have this Judgment pa&s;&s;ed upon them for it; <HI>Make the heart of this people Fat, &amp; make their Ears Heavy, and Shut their Eyes.</HI> The whole <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation,</HI> have now for many Ages, been a Flaming Monument of &s;uch <HI>Plagues,</HI> and Fulfilment of the Prophecy that praedicted them: God hath <HI>for this Cau&s;e given them up to a vile</HI> Unbelief: they are <HI>Shut up in Unbelief,</HI> as in the <HI>Utter Darkne&s;s</HI> of a <HI>Pri&s;on,</HI> becau&s;e they have to criminally Refu&s;ed the <HI>Lord Me&s;&s;iah</HI>; and in that <HI>Pri&s;on of Unbelief,</HI> mu&s;t they Ly puni&s;hed, until the <HI>Times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</HI> The Wrath of Heaven, does not <HI>Now</HI> commonly with &s;uch <HI>Vi&s;ible Strokes</HI> from Heaven, cut off them that have provoked it, as perhaps it commonly did, when the Lord more <HI>vi&s;ibly</HI> Exhibited Him&s;elf, as a <HI>King</HI> among His People, in the <HI>Mo&s;aic Paedo|gogy.</HI> But <HI>Spiritual Plagues,</HI> and &s;uch Derelicti|ons, and &s;uch Di&s;pen&s;ations, as more immedi|ately affect the <HI>Spirits</HI> of men, with a <HI>Confirmed

<HEAD>Conclu&s;ion III.</HEAD>
<P>As well <HI>Scripture</HI> as <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> tells us, That <HI>Sins</HI> may truly be accounted <HI>Puni&s;hments</HI>; and that it is among the wor&s;t of <HI>Puni&s;hments,</HI> to be <HI>given up</HI> unto a <HI>Reprobate mind.</HI> As there is a <HI>Moral Evil</HI> in every <HI>Sin,</HI> &s;o <HI>Sin</HI> may be reckoned a <HI>Paen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l Evil</HI> too. There is no <HI>Sin,</HI> but what is a <HI>Mi&s;ery</HI> as well as a <HI>Sin.</HI> A man, by Running into <HI>Sin,</HI> does run into <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI>: The Sinner does, according to 1 <HI>Joh</HI> 1 6 <HI>Walk in Darkne&s;s</HI>: And is it not a mi&s;erable thing to <HI>Walk in Dark|ne&s;s</HI> from day to day? A plagued <HI>Egypt</HI> &s;carce knew a thing more mi&s;erable. By every <HI>Sin,</HI> a man is Degraded, and Deba&s;ed and Di&s;graced, and made a mi&s;erable Wretch. Hence we are told, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 3 23. <HI>All have &s;inned, and come &s;hort of the glory of God.</HI> Alas, By <HI>Sinning,</HI> we very &s;adly Loo&s;e our <HI>glory.

<P>ABout the Year, 1646. here was one <HI>Mary Martin,</HI> who&s;e Father going from hence to <HI>England,</HI> Left her in the Hou&s;e of a Married Man, who yet became &s;o Enamoured on <HI>her,</HI> that he attempted her Cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>Such was her Weakne&s;s and Folly, that &s;he yielded unto the Temptations of that mi&s;erable man; but yet with &s;uch horrible Regret of Mind, that begging of God, for Deliverance from her Temptations, her plea was, <HI>That if e|ver &s;he were Overtaken again, &s;he would Leave her &s;elf unto His Ju&s;tice, to be made a publick Exam|ple.</HI></P>
<P>Heaven will convince the Sinful Children of men, that the <HI>Vowes,</HI> which they make, Rely|ing on the Stability and Re&s;olution of their own Hearts, are of no Significancy. A <HI>Chain</HI> of <HI>Hell</HI> was upon her, and the forfeited <HI>Grace</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI> was witheld from her; She fell a <HI>Third Time,</HI> into the Sin, again&s;t which her <HI>Vowes</HI> had been uttered.</P>
<P>Afterwards, going to Service in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> &s;he found her &s;elf to have Conceived: But &s;he Liv|ed with a favourable Mi&s;tre&s;s, who would ad|mit and allow no &s;u&s;picion of her <HI>Di&s;honesty,</HI></P>
<P>A Que&s;tion, Like that Convincing One, of our Saviours unto the Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> was once oddly put unto her; Mary, <HI>Where is thy

<P>She concealed her Crime, till the Time of her Delivery; and then, being Delivered a|lone, by her &s;elf in a Dark Room, She Murder|ed the harmle&s;s and helple&s;s <HI>Infant</HI>; hiding it in a Che&s;t, from the Eyes of all, but the Jealous GOD.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blood</HI> of the Child Cried, when the Cry of the Child it &s;elf were thus cruelly &s;ti|fled. Some circum&s;tances quickly occurr'd, which obliged her Friends to charge her with an <HI>Unlawful Birth.</HI> She Denied it Impudently. A further Search confuted her Denial. She then &s;aid; <HI>The Child was Dead Born, and &s;he had Burnt it to A&s;hes.</HI> With an Hypocritical Tear, &s;he added, <HI>Oh! that it were True, that the poor Babe were any where to be &s;een</HI>!
