<P>THAT Great Preacher of the Go&s;pel, and <HI>In&s;atiable Admirer of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> our Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> in all his Writings, but e&s;pecially in the Epi&s;tle, which he wrote unto the <HI>Romans,</HI> [which was by <HI>Melancthon</HI> well called, <HI>The Prote&s;tants Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI>] as well as his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> does abundantly maintain this Article of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Faith, That a man is not Ju&s;tified by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Ju&s;ti|fying Faith</HI></HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Receiving of, and a Relying on the <HI>Gift of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> from God, by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; or the Con&s;ent of a Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul&punc; to be <HI>Ju&s;tified,</HI> by Gods <HI>Graciou&s;ly Imputing</HI> unto him, the <HI>Obedience</HI> which the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t&punc; as our <HI>Surety,</HI> yielded unto God, on the behalf of His Elect.

Go&s;pel; Tis only in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that <HI>Faith,</HI> &amp; no <HI>Grace,</HI> but <HI>this Faith,</HI> ha's the Honour to <HI>Ju&s;ti|fy</HI> us. This is the <HI>Good old way,</HI> of arriving unto <HI>Re&s;t</HI>; and, <HI>Aliter qui Vadit, cadit.</HI></P>
<P>But every <HI>Jewel</HI> ha's a <HI>Counterfeit.</HI> And, <HI>How &s;hall a man know, that his Faith in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for his Ju&s;tification, is not a Counter&s;eit?</HI></P>
<P>To an&s;wer that Ca&s;e, the Ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle <HI>James,</HI> under the <HI>In&s;pirations of the Almighty,</HI> de|clares unto us, the <HI>Marks</HI> of a <HI>Ju&s;tifying Faith</HI>; and tho&s;e <HI>Marks</HI> are, the <HI>Works</HI> which it per|petually di&s;po&s;es the Believer unto.</P>
<P>Now among the Admonitions of the Apo&s;tle to this purpo&s;e, there is a &s;pecial Remark due to that, in Jam. 2.20. <HI>Wilt thou know, O vain man, that Faith without works is Dead?</HI></P>
<P>The Reader will pre&s;ently ob&s;erve in this Re|markable pa&s;&s;age; both the Character of the <HI>Faith,</HI> which does not produce and promote <HI>Good Works,</HI> in the <HI>man</HI> that hath it: It is a <HI>Dead Faith</HI>; it will be of no u&s;e unto the man in whom it is; it can do nothing for him: and then, the Character of the <HI>Man</HI> who ha's this <HI>Faith</HI>; He is a <HI>vain man</HI>; he &s;eems, and he boa&s;ts, to <HI>have,</HI> what he hath <HI>not</HI>; and he flatters him&s;elf with <HI>Hopes</HI> that ne|ver &s;hall be made Good unto him. So that, we are now A&s;&s;ured, <HI>A Workle&s;s Faith is a Worthle&s;s Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Paul,</HI> who Profe&s;&s;edly handles the Doctrine of <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> does plainly a&s;&s;ert, That no man

living is <HI>Ju&s;tified</HI> by <HI>Works,</HI> but a man is <HI>Ju&s;tifyed</HI> only by <HI>Faith. James</HI> does neverthele&s;s a&s;&s;ert, That a man is <HI>Ju&s;tified</HI> by <HI>Works,</HI> and a man is not <HI>Ju&s;tified</HI> by <HI>Faith</HI> only. And yet, however &s;ome of the Ancients, as well as <HI>Luther</HI> &s;tumbled at this <HI>Appearance of Contradiction,</HI> the A&s;&s;ertions do not Contradict one another at all. <HI>Paul</HI> treats of our <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> before <HI>God,</HI> and the Right unto Everla&s;ting Life, therein granted unto us, which is only by <HI>Faith</HI> in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>James</HI> treats of that which may manife&s;t our <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> unto <HI>men,</HI> that See &amp; Hear, our Profe&s;&s;ion of our <HI>Faith</HI>; and here <HI>Works</HI> are &s;ignificant. The <HI>Con|&s;cience</HI> of a man, may be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with a two|fold <HI>Accu&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, A man may be Accu&s;ed of <HI>Iniquity</HI>; It may be &s;aid, <HI>Thou ha&s;t broken the Law, and thereby wronged the Name, of God, and the terrible penalty of that Law, now belongs unto thee.</HI> The An&s;wer to this <HI>Accu&s;ation</HI> is to be, <HI>My Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t ha's fully obey'd the will of God, and &s;uffered the penalty due to me for my Di&s;obedience; and I do by Faith de|pend on this Righteou&s;ne&s;s of my Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for my Acceptance with God for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, A man may be Accu&s;ed of <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI>; It may be &s;aid, <HI>Thou Talkest of thy Faith; but is it not meer Talk? How can&s;t thou prove, that thy Faith is any more, than what is in the very Devils them|&s;elves?</HI> The An&s;wer to this <HI>Accu&s;ation</HI> is, <HI>The works of a Sanctified man, which I am doing every Day, are the Proof of my Faith.</HI> According hereunto it is a&s;&s;erted
<PB N="6" REF="000800_0005_0FAA50A029FC7D48">
by <HI>Paul,</HI> That a man is <HI>Ju&s;tified alone by Faith:</HI> but it is a&s;&s;erted by <HI>James,</HI> That a man is <HI>not Ju&s;tified by a Faith which is alone.</HI> The Que&s;tion di&s;cour&s;ed by <HI>Paul</HI> is, <HI>How a Guilty Per&s;on may come to be Acquitted by the Lord, from all the Guilt that lies upon him?</HI> The An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion, is, Not by any <HI>Works</HI> of our own, but only by the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which is, on our part, only by <HI>Faith</HI> applied unto us. The Que&s;tion di&s;cour&s;ed by <HI>James,</HI> is, <HI>Whether a man pretending to Faith in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hall be &s;aved, though he continue without the works of an Holy Life, agreeable thereunto</HI>? The An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion is, <HI>No,</HI> Such a man ha's no <HI>Saving Faith</HI> at all. And that <HI>James</HI> is to be taken in that &s;en&s;e, is evident from This: He does in&s;i&s;t upon the In&s;tance of <HI>Abraham</HI>; and yet <HI>Abraham</HI> was a <HI>Ju&s;tified man,</HI> Thirty years, before tho&s;e <HI>Works,</HI> which are &s;aid here to <HI>Ju&s;tify</HI> him Upon the whole then, we &s;ee <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>James,</HI> Recon|ciled, or, indeed, never contrdicting. And we are Advi&s;ed after all; Tis a <HI>Vanity</HI> in any man to <HI>Profe&s;s,</HI> that he ha's a <HI>True Faith</HI> in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, if his <HI>Faith</HI> be not <HI>Fruitful</HI> in tho&s;e <HI>Good Works,</HI> which may <HI>Ju&s;tify</HI> the mans <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>There are Two very Important <HI>Ca&s;es,</HI> about which the Thoughts of every Chri&s;tian, cannot but be Exerci&s;ed; and we will here be&s;tow &s;ome of our Thoughts thereupon.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> which a Chri&s;tian, mu&s;t Con&s;ider, if he would be a <HI>Christian,</HI> is,
<PB N="7" REF="000800_0006_0FAA50A1086903E0">
What are tho&s;e <HI>Good Works,</HI> which a True Faith, will Quicken &amp; Incline the Believer unto?</P>
<P>Now we may thus conceive of them; <HI>Good Works,</HI> are <HI>Sincere E&s;&s;ayes</HI> to ob&s;erve the <HI>Law of God.</HI> Our God hath given us <HI>a Rule of Life,</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ich we call, <HI>The Moral Law.</HI> None of our <HI>Works</HI> are <HI>Perfectly Good,</HI> if in any point they fall &s;hort of that <HI>Rule.</HI> But none of our <HI>Works</HI> do <HI>Perfectly</HI> come up to the <HI>Rule,</HI> as long as we are lodg'd in <HI>this Body which is to Dy.</HI> The <HI>Be&s;t men</HI> alive, when they look upon the <HI>Be&s;t Works</HI> of their Lives, may cry out, with one of the Ancients, <HI>Terret me tota vita mea, nam apparet mihi, aut Pee|catum, aut tota Sterilitas</HI>; The <HI>Sinfulne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Bar|ranne&s;s,</HI> of all my <HI>Life,</HI> &s;trikes me with a <HI>Deadly Terror</HI> of Soul! Neverthele&s;s, there are <HI>Sincere E&s;&s;ays</HI> towards <HI>Perfection,</HI> which all Believers are Con&s;cientiou&s;ly making every Day. Now the&s;e <HI>E&s;&s;ayes</HI> are <HI>Good,</HI> in the Merciful Reckoning of God, our <HI>Father</HI> in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Tho' none of our <HI>Sincere E&s;&s;ayes</HI> at <HI>Well-doing</HI> are &s;uch <HI>Good works</HI> as to <HI>Ju&s;tify</HI> us, before that Thrice <HI>Holy God,</HI> who is of <HI>Purer eyes than to behold Evil,</HI> &amp; who&s;e <HI>Pure Eyes</HI> yet <HI>behold</HI> in our <HI>Good Works,</HI> a world of <HI>Evil</HI>: Yet our <HI>Sincere E&s;&s;ayes</HI> are plea&s;ing unto our God, who by His Good <HI>Spirit</HI> ha's Excited them, &amp; A&s;&s;i&s;ted them; and, <HI>Who&s;e workman&s;hip we are, Created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto Good works, which God hath before ordained, that we &s;hould walk in them.</HI> Such Good <HI>Works,</HI> as our <HI>Prayers,</HI> are, as tis &s;aid, in Prov. 15.8.
<PB N="8" REF="000800_0007_0FAA50A1AE8218F0">
<HI>The Delight of the Lord</HI>; and &s;uch Good <HI>Works,</HI> as our <HI>Alms,</HI> are, as tis &s;aid, in Heb. 13.16. <HI>The Sacrifices where-with God is well plea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>But now, to &s;peak &s;trictly, <HI>Good Works</HI> mu&s;t have the&s;e Four Ingredients to render them <HI>&s;uch.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t; The <HI>Matter</HI> of our <HI>Works</HI> mu&s;t be&punc; ac|cording to the <HI>Law</HI> of God, or, His <HI>Will</HI> Revealed in His <HI>Word.</HI> The Prophet could &s;ay, in Mic. 6.8. <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee, O man, the thing that is Good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to Do Ju&s;tice, and to Love Mercy, and to walk Hum|bly with thy God. Good Works</HI> mu&s;t be &s;uch, as the Lord hath <HI>&s;hewn</HI> to us, that He hath <HI>Required</HI> of us. They are no <HI>Good Works,</HI> whereof our God may &s;ay, <HI>Who hath required 'em</HI>? Works of <HI>Piety,</HI> are <HI>Good Works</HI>; for we have the <HI>Word</HI> of our God for them; as in P&s;al. 92.1. <HI>It is a Good Thing to give Thanks unto the Lord.</HI> Works of <HI>Charity</HI> are <HI>Good Works</HI>; for we have the <HI>word</HI> of our God for them; as in Heb. 13.16. <HI>To Do Good, and to Communicate, forget not.</HI> No works are <HI>Good,</HI> but &s;uch as are contained in the <HI>Two Tables</HI> of the <HI>Ten Commandments</HI>; the Command|ments of <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> and of <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>But unto the Con&s;titution of <HI>Good Works,</HI> it is not enough, that the <HI>matter</HI> of what we do, be according to the <HI>Law</HI> of God. Men may do <HI>Works</HI> that &s;hall be <HI>Good</HI> for the <HI>matter</HI> of them, and yet, <HI>Every work of their Hands be unclean, &s;aith the Lord. Plowing</HI> is Lawful, and <HI>Praying</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="000800_0008_0FAA50A280C92818">
is Lawful; and yet the&s;e <HI>works</HI> may be &s;inful in the Doer of them. Wherefore,</P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>Manner</HI> of our <HI>Works,</HI> mu&s;t be Right, as well as the <HI>Matter</HI> of them. A man may incur the Wrath of God, by his <HI>Good Works,</HI> if he do them not in any <HI>manner</HI> accor|ding to the <HI>Law,</HI> as they &s;hould be done. We find, in 1 Chron. 15.13. <HI>The Lord our God</HI> is offended at tho&s;e who <HI>Seek Him not after the due Order.</HI> No meer <HI>External Actions</HI> are to be E|&s;teemed <HI>Good Works</HI>; there mu&s;t <HI>Internal Cautions</HI> go along with them; el&s;e they are but the <HI>matter</HI> of <HI>Good Works,</HI> without the <HI>Form. Good Works</HI> mu&s;t be done with <HI>Regular Circum&s;tances,</HI> if they would be called, <HI>Good.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, The <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of our <HI>Works</HI> mu&s;t be Right, as well as the <HI>manner</HI> of them. The <HI>De|&s;ign</HI> which the <HI>Law</HI> of God has a&s;&s;igned for our <HI>Good Works,</HI> is, That the Great God, may be acknowledged, and magnified, and glorified: And the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of God, coming in, has a&s;&s;igned a further <HI>De&s;ign</HI> for them; namely, To expre&s;s our <HI>Gratitude</HI> unto our Lord Redeemer, for His Redeeming of us. Thus 'tis Enjoined, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.30. <HI>Whatever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</HI> An <HI>Evil Intention</HI> will utterly &s;poil any <HI>Good Works,</HI> tho' they were otherwi&s;e never &s;o <HI>Good.</HI> And a meerly <HI>Selfi&s;h Intention</HI> is an <HI>Evil</HI> one. <HI>Good Works</HI> mu&s;t all be done, with an Eye, to the <HI>Honour</HI> of God, and the <HI>Service</HI> of Chri&s;t, before any <HI>Temporal Advantage</HI> to <HI>Self</HI>: el&s;e the
<PB N="10" REF="000800_0009_0FAA50A32CD52858">
<HI>Be&s;t Sacrifices</HI> are but an <HI>Abomination.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Good Works</HI> mu&s;t proceed from a <HI>Good <HI>Principle</HI></HI>; or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">therwi&s;e they will have no <HI>Real Goodne&s;s</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them.

We are told, in Mat. 12.35. <HI>A Good man, out of the Good Trea&s;ure of the Heart, bringeth forth Good Things.</HI> A <HI>Good Principle</HI> within, is a <HI>Good Trea|&s;ure of the Heart. Works</HI> done meerly from a Principle of <HI>Slavi&s;h Fear,</HI> or <HI>Fle&s;hly Love,</HI> are not <HI>Good,</HI> tho' they be never &s;o <HI>Good.</HI> There mu&s;t be a <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>Re&s;pect unto God in Christ,</HI> woo|ing us unto all our <HI>Good Works,</HI> or el&s;e they are <HI>Stark Naught.</HI> Yea, the <HI>Spirit</HI> of our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, mu&s;t be in us, as a <HI>Vital Principle,</HI> for our <HI>Good Works,</HI> or el&s;e they are <HI>Dead Works,</HI> every one of them. Hence, no <HI>Good Works</HI> were ever done by any one <HI>Unregenerate</HI> man, &s;ince the World began; for every <HI>Unregenerate</HI> man is de&s;titu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the <HI>Principle,</HI> which is to be acted in them: the mo&s;t <HI>Splendid Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, are but (as <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> call'd them) <HI>Splendid Sins</HI> before the Lord.</P>
<P>And now there is a Second <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> which a Chri&s;tian has to con&s;ider, that &s;o he may be &s;tirred up, and helped on, to do tho&s;e <HI>Good Works</HI> by which he may approve him&s;elf indeed a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="000800_0010_0FAA50A42059C8B8">Where Lies the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of Good Works, in a Ju&s;ti|fied Belsever, to Ju&s;tifie the Faith, which he is a Profe&s;&s;or of?</P>
<P>Now we do know this; That our <HI>Good Works</HI> are not <HI>Antecedently</HI> nece&s;&s;ary unto our <HI>Ju|&s;tification</HI> before the God of Heaven. For <HI>Good VVorks</HI> cannot be done by any man, <HI>until</HI> he be <HI>Ju&s;tified.</HI> Until a man be <HI>United</HI> unto the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is our <HI>Life,</HI> he is a <HI>Dead man:</HI> and what <HI>Good Works</HI> can a <HI>Dead man</HI> do? This is a thing <HI>Livelily</HI> Preached unto us, by our Lord Him&s;elf, in the fifteenth Chapter of <HI>John; The mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it.</HI> Hence that common &s;aying of <HI>Au&s;tin, Bona Opera &s;equuntur Ju&s;tification, non praecedunt Ju&s;tificandum.</HI> No, nor is <HI>Faith</HI> it &s;elf, <HI>As</HI> doing of <HI>Good Works,</HI> that which Enti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">les us unto the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for our <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI>; 'Tis <HI>Faith,</HI> only <HI>As</HI> it Layes Hold on the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the chief of Sinners,</HI> that <HI>Justifies</HI> us; And until this be done, we cannot be carried forth unto any <HI>Good Works</HI> at all.</P>
<P>But then, <HI>Good Works,</HI> are <HI>con&s;equently</HI> nece&s;&s;a|ry upon our <HI>Ju&s;tification.</HI> 'Tis indeed &s;aid, That <HI>God Ju&s;tifies the Ungodly</HI>; but then, He does not Leave them <HI>Ungodly</HI> when He hath <HI>Ju&s;tified</HI> them.

This &s;orrow and mourning hath al|wayes a great mixture of <HI>hardne&s;s</HI> and <HI>pride of heart</HI> with it: for in nothing are we <HI>perfect</HI> in this life; and what is there almo&s;t that a humbled Soul complains of more, and de&s;ires to get rid of more, than of an <HI>hard,</HI> and a <HI>proud</HI> heart; and &s;o much of this is &s;ometimes &s;een, and felt, that a per&s;on fears there is <HI>nothing el&s;e.</HI> See <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 63.17. This is certainly one part of a Chri&s;tians work, and his <HI>Warfare</HI> is within his own heart, with the pride, hardne&s;s, unbrokenne&s;s, and other di&s;tem|pers thereof. Some Profe&s;&s;ors indeed find no hard work with their own hearts, they think they have <HI>all things,</HI> and have <HI>need of nothing</HI>; but the&s;e are indeed <HI>mi&s;erable, wretched, blind and naked,</HI> Rev. 3.17.

(3.) This &s;or|row and aba&s;ement is a <HI>growing thing</HI>: if other Graces grow, this doth; and as this groweth &s;o do all other: if a per&s;on don't grow in <HI>Humiliati|on</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> he groweth not at all, &s;o <HI>as in|deed to increa&s;e with the increa&s;e of God.</HI> Now this growth in &s;ome, indeed is very little; as &s;ome men, &s;o &s;ome Chri&s;tians are very low in &s;tature:

and there are <HI>Winter &s;ea&s;ons</HI> in many Chri&s;tians lives, in which they grow but little, or not at all: yet in their general cour&s;e they do grow.

<P N="2">2.

<P>Now, having mentioned this, as one thing to try our &s;elves by, we mu&s;t clear and open the point, and endeavour to free it, ere we leave it, from what&s;oever might cloud and darken it: And the difficulty is to &s;hew the difference be|tween the effects of <HI>Legal terrors,</HI> and <HI>Common Convictions</HI> in <HI>restraining &s;in,</HI> and that of <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>mortifying &s;in:</HI> and the difference between that effect which that <HI>faith</HI> which is yet indeed but a <HI>Dead faith</HI> may have upon <HI>&s;in,</HI> and that which a <HI>Lively faith</HI> hath in <HI>mortifying</HI> of &s;in.</P>

<P N="2">2. If any man think he be not <HI>&s;trongly incli|ned this way</HI>; it is becau&s;e he doth not know <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> and becau&s;e the matter never came in|deed to tryal, in the Soul.

<P N="2">2.
