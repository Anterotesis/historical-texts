</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words are part of a <HI>Sermon</HI> which was Preached by <HI>Paul</HI> an <HI>Antioch,</HI> wherein he demon&s;trates the Re&s;urrection of the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, by what is written in the 16<HI>th.</HI> P&s;alm, where it is &s;aid, <HI>thou &s;halt not &s;uffer thine Holy One to &s;ee Corruption.</HI> That mu&s;t needs be meant either of <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf or of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>: But it cannot be &s;o affirmed of <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf, for ha &s;aw Corruption. <HI>Davids</HI> Body had been turned to Du&s;t in the Grave for &s;ome Ages before that Time; therefore that pa&s;&s;age in the P&s;alm mu&s;t be meant of Chri&s;t, who&s;e Holy Body did not lie long enough i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Grave to &s;ee Corruption. This is the Apo|&s;tles

&s;cope and de&s;ign in the words before us, which are a Compe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dious Hi&s;tory of the Life and Death of <HI>David.</HI> 1. We have his Life. It was a Life of Service to his own Generation, and that by the Will of God. The Greek word <HI>HUPERETESAS,</HI> here Tran&s;lated <HI>he had Served,</HI> is a <HI>Metaphor</HI> taken from <HI>Rowers,</HI> who &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve the Pi|lot in the &s;afe pa&s;&s;age of the Ve&s;&s;el. This World is a Sea, the Church is like a Ship to&s;&s;ed on the Sea, God is the Pilot, by who&s;e Skill and Provi|dence that Ship is Steered: He is plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of men as <HI>Under-Rowers</HI> to Serve his Providence. Whereas <HI>David</HI> is here &s;aid to Serve <HI>his own Generation</HI>; That Expre&s;&s;ion may imply two things. (1.) That he Served the People who Lived in the &s;ame Age in which he Lived; for in that &s;en&s;e is the word frequently u&s;ed in the Scripture. No man can do Service for a Generation of men who were gone out of the World before he came into it. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> can a|ny man do Service for tho&s;e that &s;hall come in|to the World, after he is gone out of it, except|ing what he did whil&s;t him&s;elf was here. (2.) A Generation is &s;ometimes taken for <HI>the Age of one man,</HI> as well as for the men of one Age. Thus when 'tis &s;aid, <HI>David</HI> Served his own Generation, this is intended, <HI>&s;c.</HI> that as long as he Lived in the World, he continued to Serve tho&s;e that were his Contemporaries. He Lived to be Seventy years old, and &s;o long did he con|tinue
<PB N="5" REF="000831_0004_0FAB4064681BFD78">
a Servant of his Generation. Moreover, when it is affirmed, that He Served them <HI>by the Will of God,</HI> that may import: (1.) That he fulfilled the Decree of God in that his Service. He did all ths Service which God from Eterni|ty had willed that <HI>David</HI> &s;hould do. As no Servant of the Lord can Dy before the appoint|ed time, &s;o neither &s;hall he Dy until he has fini&s;h|ed all that work which God has a&s;ore determi|ned that that man &s;hall do. Every Servant of God is Immortal, until his work is done. (2.) The Expre&s;&s;ion imports, that the Precep|tive Will of God was that according to which <HI>David</HI> acted in his Serving his own Generation. As he u&s;ed to Pray that he might know, and that he might do the Will of God. We hear him praying, <HI>Give me Under&s;tanding,</HI> &s;hew me the way wherein I &s;hould go, Lord, <HI>Teach me to do thy Will,</HI> &s;o he did Practi&s;e according to his own Prayers. Thus did <HI>David</HI> Live.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have a de&s;cription of the Death of this Faithful Servant of God, and of his People. (1.) <HI>He fell A&s;leep.</HI> That Expre&s;&s;ion and De|&s;cription of Death when applied to Holy men, intimates an happy Death: In this World (as 'tis &s;aid of <HI>Judah</HI>) they <HI>find no re&s;t</HI>; but Death puts an end to all their hard Service and Suffer|ings. (2.) <HI>He was Laid unto his Fathers.</HI> This is true both in re&s;pect of his Body which was Laid in the Grave, as his Fore fathers who
<PB N="6" REF="000831_0005_0FAB4065F7638CD8">
were Dead had been. And in re&s;pect of his Soul, which which was carried to that Heaven, where his good Father <HI>Je&s;&s;e</HI> (whom the Jews are wont to call <HI>Je&s;&s;ai the Righteous</HI>) and his Fore-fathers, <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> were gone before. Often in the Scripture when men dy, they are &s;aid to be <HI>Gathered unto their People</HI>; which Expre&s;&s;ion implies the Immorta|lity of the Soul. At the Hour of Death men pa&s;s out of this World into the World of Souls. (3.) <HI>David &s;aw Corruption</HI>; which is to be un|der&s;tood not of his Spirit, but of his Body on|ly. That Corruption is in order to a Re&s;ur|rection unto a Glorious Incorruption. As Grain, it may chance or Wheat or &s;ome other Grain, is &s;own under the Earth, and then it corrupts, but after that ri&s;eth again with a great addition of beauty; &s;o it is as to the Dead Bo|dies of Saints, they are &s;own in Corruption, but rai&s;ed in Incorruption. This may &s;erve for the opening of the words.</P>
<P>The Doctrine from them is,</P>
<P>That the Grave will be a Ble&s;&s;ed Bed of Re&s;t to that man who &s;hall Serve his own Generation ac|cording to the Will of God.</P>

Whenas the mo&s;t &s;plendid Services not proceeding from the&s;e principles are of no account. King <HI>Amaziah</HI> did notable things in his Generation, which the Church of God in that age was benefited by. He de&s;troyed no le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and of their Enemies: but God did not approve of him, becau&s;e his heart was not rightly principled in what he did. It is noted of him that <HI>he did that which was right in the &s;ight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart.</HI> 2 Chron. 25.2. He wanted faith in Chri&s;t, &amp; a &s;incere love to God in what he did. There have been among&s;t the Gentiles famous <HI>Heroes,</HI> who have done mighty things for their Country in the age wherein they lived, but &s;ince they had not faith in Chri&s;t, all tho&s;e Services were (as <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> truly &s;peaks) no better than <HI>Splendida peccata,</HI> gli&s;tering &s;ins.</P>
<P>Moreover, Men will be &s;pirited and inclined

according as they are principled. The man that has faith which worketh by love in his heart, can not be of a meer &s;elfi&s;h Spirit. It is private Intere&s;t and Selfi&s;hne&s;s which makes men un|&s;erviceable to the World in their Generation. Whenas it is impo&s;&s;ible that the &s;ame Per&s;on &s;hould be a true Believer oh Chri&s;t, and yet a meer &s;elf-&s;eeker. Faith and Love will make a Chri&s;tian deny him&s;elf, that &s;o he may pro|mote the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t, and the good of his People. This we &s;ee in <HI>Timothy</HI> of whom the Apo&s;tle writing to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> giveth this Character, <HI>For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your &s;tate: for all &s;eek their own, not the things which are Je&s;us Chri&s;ts.</HI> Phil. 2.20, 21. He that would do Service for his Ge|neration mu&s;t be of a publick Spirit. He mu&s;t have a large Soul that &s;hall de&s;ign and endeavour not &s;o much his own particular profit, as the good of many. A man can't Serve his Gene|ration without Serving many: for there is no Generation wherein there are not many who&s;e welfare is to be endeavoured. For this we have a great Example in <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cai,</HI> who <HI>was accepted of the Multitude of his Brethren, &s;eeking the wealth of his People.</HI> E&s;th 13 3.
