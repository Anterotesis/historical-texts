<P>Lord, make me to know mine end, and the mea&s;ure of my dayes, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>UPon a like &s;ad and melancholly Occa&s;i|on, after I had largely Expounded the words read unto you; I propoun|ded the&s;e follewing Heads to be di&s;|cour&s;ed on. <HI>Namely,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">lain more particularly, what it is to know <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>End,</HI> and wherein this Know|edge does con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Shew whereto this &s;ame Knowledge of our Mortality &s;erveth, and what Benefits accrue therefrom.</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider who it is that mu&s;t furni&s;h us with his Wi&s;dom, and di&s;po&s;e us by his Grace,
<PB N="8" REF="000833_0003_0FAB40B629312E68">
to know our Mortality? namely, God; imply'd in the&s;e words: <HI>Lord make me to know,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. Enquire what Cour&s;e is to be taken, and what to be done on our parts, that we may pre|vail with the Lord to be&s;tow that Wi&s;dom and Grace upon us.</P>
<P N="5">5thly and La&s;tly, Make &s;ome &s;uitable Appli|cation.</P>
<P>I began with the fir&s;t thing propo&s;ed, which was to explain more particularly, what 'tis <HI>to know our End,</HI> and wherein this Knowledge do's con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>And therefore to know our End, do's as I take it, imply the&s;e two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;erious Thoughts and Con&s;ideration of Death.</P>
<P N="2">2. The good Effects which tho&s;e Thoughts, and that Con&s;ideration ought to have on the re|maining part of our Lives.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;erious thoughts and con&s;ideration of Death, <HI>i. e</HI> of our Departure into another World, or of the Souls de&s;erting the Body.</P>
<P>And concerning this, there are three things chiefly which we are concerned to take notice of.</P>
<P N="1">1. That our Lives are in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> God, which he may either prolong or abbreviate as in his <HI>Godly Wi&s;dom</HI> he &s;eeth convenient, either continue to us, or take from us, when and by what means &s;oever He plea&s;eth.</P>
<P N="2">2. That how long &s;oever our End or Remo|val
<PB N="9" REF="000833_0004_0FAB40B6E93C2700">
hence be delay'd, we have great rea&s;on to prepare immediately for't.</P>
<P N="3">3. That whether we make a due Preparation for Death, or whether we forbear, 'tis certain it will come, and that in no long time neither. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, I ha' already di&s;patcht. I pa&s;s therefore immediately to the Second Ob&s;ervati|on: Which is,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That how long,</HI> &amp;c. Multitudes we daily &s;ee are &s;uddenly &s;nacht away; &s;o &s;uddenly, that they are &s;carce <HI>&s;pared a little while,</HI> to take leave of their Surviving Friends, <HI>before they go hence, and are no more &s;een.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore O man, who&s;oever thou art, whether aged and decriped, or even in thy young and healthful days, flatter not thy &s;elf with ima|ginary hopes that thou &s;halt have time enough to make thy &s;elf ready for <HI>another</HI> State, when Sick|ne&s;s comes and fairly warns thee to depart out of <HI>This</HI>; for thou knowe&s;t not how &s;oon the <HI>King of Terrors</HI> may &s;urprize thee; and by how much the more &s;ecure thou art, by &s;o much the more unexpected and a&s;toni&s;hing will his coming be.</P>
<P>But farther, &s;uppo&s;e Death &s;hould lay hold on thee when thou thinke&s;t not of him, what Pro|bability is there that thou &s;houlde&s;t in that Con|&s;ternation which is common in the&s;e Ca&s;es, be &s;o much thy &s;elf, or retain &s;uch Pre&s;ence of Mind, as to make a &s;ufficient Preparation? Alas! Vain man! How &s;hall I expo&s;tulate this Matter with thee? Shall I &s;hew thee the Danger and
<PB N="10" REF="000833_0005_0FAB40B7A8FD4D28">
folly of delaying to put thy &s;elf in a readine&s;s? I fear thou wilt look on this as a needle&s;s work, &s;hould I undertake it; for if the Almighty can Cut us off when he's minded, and when we are not in the lea&s;t aware of it, (as &s;urely he can) it mu&s;t undoubtedly be the greate&s;t Wi&s;dom and Safety in us to make a timely Provi&s;ion, &amp; to be always on our Guard, if we mean &s;o to <HI>Fini&s;h our Cour&s;e,</HI> that from thenceforth there may be <HI>Laid up for us a Crown of Life.</HI></P>
<P>Or rather, &s;hall I In&s;truct thee in the mi&s;chie|vous Con&s;equences of tru&s;ting to a late Provi&s;ion? Why this is the main Concern of our Lives, and is Old Age that State that is generally attended with continual Infirmities, Aches and Defects, a proper Sea&s;on to begin the Greate&s;t and mo&s;t Difficult Task in? In our temporal Concerns, tho' of infinite le&s;s Moment, we act with greater Rea|&s;on, and more like our &s;elves; 'tis only in the management of our Spiritual Affairs, and things of the highe&s;t Concernment, that we &s;o &s;hame|fully Expo&s;e our &s;elves. Do we not for Exam|ple when the Ca&s;e of &s;ome urgent, weighty Bui|ne&s;s lies upon us, endeavour to di&s;patch it with all the Expedition po&s;&s;ible? How &s;eldom do we fail, when a long and tedious Journey is to be taken, to be before-hand with the Sun, at lea&s;t to &s;et out betimes in the Morning?</P>
<P>Now does any Bu&s;ine&s;s in the World require &s;o much ha&s;te and care in the Execution of it, as that of, <HI>Working out our own Salvation with
<PB N="11" REF="000833_0006_0FAB40B868EF7E00">
Fear and Trembling,</HI> &s;ince this Task is extreamly difficult, and this &s;hort Life the only time we have to perform it in; and why then do you not immediately &s;et about it.</P>
<P>Again, Are we not all Travelling to a better Country? and are we not all <HI>Strangers</HI> and <HI>So|journers</HI> here, and bound for Heaven, <HI>as all our Fathers were</HI>; nay, and is not the <HI>Gate &s;trait,</HI> and the <HI>Way narrow that leadeth</HI> to't; are there not multitudes of Hard&s;hips to be encountred, and innumerable Difficulties to be rubb'd through, before we can come to po&s;&s;e&s;s that <HI>Good Land:</HI> And why then (in Gods Name) do ye loiter? Why do ye put off the Journey from one time to another? as tho' 'twere a matter indifferent whe|ther you advance or no; or as tho' God in His Superabundant Mercy would bring Happine&s;s to you, when by rea&s;on of Age, and Weakne&s;s you are le&s;s fit and di&s;po&s;ed to &s;eek after That. Sirs, be not deceived, for tho' God mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be of great Kindne&s;s, and rich in Love; yet &s;eeing his Goodne&s;s, does not &s;wallow up his Ju&s;tice and Truth, &s;eeing he has Ordain'd, that by <HI>Running the Race that is &s;et before us,</HI> we &s;hould only pre&s;ume to obtain the promi&s;ed Reward; &s;eeing we cannot hope to procure this any other way; nay la&s;tly, &s;eeing we have been idle, and lavi&s;hed away that Time, and tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Oppor|tunities which were afforded on Purpo&s;e that we might prepare for our <HI>Change</HI>; we by tru&s;ting to a Late, or <HI>Death-bed Repentance,</HI> do not only
<PB N="12" REF="000833_0007_0FAB40B92A022680">
run the Risk of having our Sun &s;et before our Work be done; but al&s;o of provoking God to accelerate and ha&s;ten our End, to abridge his Long-&s;ufferance, and to plung us down quick in|to <HI>Un&s;peakable and Endle&s;s Mi&s;ery.</HI></P>
<P>It highly concerns us therefore mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly to ob&s;erve that whole&s;ome Admonition of our Lord and Saviour, Mat. 24.42, 43, 44. <HI>Watch therefore, for ye know not what Hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the Good man of the Hou&s;e had known in what Watch the Thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have &s;uffered his Hou&s;e to be broken up. Therefore be ye al&s;o ready; for in &s;uch an Hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh.</HI></P>
<P>Farther yet, &s;uppo&s;e, which neverthele&s;s we cannot po&s;&s;ibly be well a&s;&s;ured of, that we &s;hall not be immaturely taken hence, but have &s;ome monitory &s;ymptoms of approaching Death, &s;ome friendly Sickne&s;s adverti&s;e us of our Danger; yet 'tis very uncertain, whether we &s;hall then be in a Capacity to prepare our &s;elves or not. For (the truth is) the very Di&s;temper, which we depend upon, to forewarn us of our hazzardous Condition, and to Summon us to our Duty, may peradventure inpi&s;po&s;e us too. Was you ever brought down to a Sick-bed? or do you know what it is to labour under the Pains and Throws, and Agonies of a Di&s;ea&s;ed Body? If any among you will &s;ay they do, and can call to mind what the Effects of your Sufferings of this nature
<PB N="13" REF="000833_0008_0FAB40B9E9CFF2F0">
have been, let me appeal to the Con&s;ciences of tho&s;e People, whether the extremity of Angui&s;h did not altogether unfit them for the underta|king, pro&s;ecuting or effecting any manner of Bu|&s;ine&s;s, be it of greater or le&s;&s;er Moment.</P>
<P>Take any man that's in pre&s;ent Torture, let it be the Girds and Twitches of the Gout or Stone, or &s;ome &s;uch Tormenting Evil, engage him on a|ny Concern of your own, and put the Bu&s;ine&s;s wholly into his hands; let him but try for once how well he can manage it: &amp; you'l be &s;atisfied in a little while that &s;uch an one is utterly incapable of minding any thing but the Accutene&s;s of his Mi&s;ery. If he that has a &s;wimming Head, and an aching Heart, a di&s;turbed Brain, and unreli&s;h|ing Palate, feeble Hands, and trembling Joynts; and in &s;hort, no &s;ound Part in his whole Body: If I &s;ay &s;uch a di&s;tempered creature can be &s;uppo|&s;ed to act rightly and commendably according to the nature of the Concern he is driving at, and the Exigency of the Occa&s;ion that moves him to it, then I confe&s;s I have hitherto enter|tain'd a wrong notion of Sickne&s;s. But if on the contrary, he cannot be allow'd to act thus, as I am &s;ure he cannot, what &s;hould make us be|lieve that they are not bewitcht, and given up to Sin, for&s;aken of their Rea&s;on, and to be de&s;paired of, who will not repent nor think of their Mor|ality in their Health, in their blooming Strength, and be&s;t Days?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="000833_0009_0FAB40BAA8FCEB80">I rather think we have greater Rea&s;on to upbraid and exclaim bitterly again&s;t them, but that they may too &s;oon find an opportunity to &s;ave us that trouble, and be their own Accu|&s;ers. May be the next time &s;uch an one re|tires into his Clo&s;et, or lays down his re&s;tle&s;s Body on his Couch; nothing but Satyr and In|vective and disjoynted Complaints will come of it. Go hide thy &s;elf in &s;ome private Corner, and hearken what he'll &s;ay then; See with what melt|ing words he begins to wi&s;h now that he had em|ploy'd his early Time, his gay and briske&s;t Days in preparing his accounts for a future Life: con|fe&s;&s;ing the mi&s;chief and unrea&s;onablene&s;s of de|ferring <HI>&s;o nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> and withal <HI>&s;o difficult</HI> a work to Sickne&s;s, the unfitte&s;t and mo&s;t impro|per Time; appealing to him&s;elf, whom he al&s;o condemns for the heinou&s;ne&s;s and pre&s;umption of &s;o doing: looking back on this his Negligence and Carele&s;sne&s;s, with Remor&s;e and Regret, and ob&s;erving before him the terrible Pro&s;pect of e|ternal Mi&s;ery with Horror and Di&s;traction.</P>
<P>Now the Gracele&s;s Wretch is brought to know him&s;elf, and to &s;peak his Thoughts; being under the awful &s;en&s;e or his lamentable Condition; a|ri&s;ing from the con&s;ideration of his own Con&s;ci|ence, chiding and rating him <HI>within</HI> for his Wic|kedne&s;s, and the Puni&s;hment awarded to his im|pious Practices <HI>without</HI>; of his re&s;i&s;ting the Checks and Re&s;traints of Nature, before he contracted
<PB N="15" REF="000833_0010_0FAB40BB68DFF188">
his Guilt, and of his being ju&s;t ready to be con&s;ign'd over to in&s;ufferable Torments for e|ver after.</P>
<P>To conclude then; if it be true, that to delay our Reformation, or making ready for another World, till Sickne&s;s or Old Age for|ceth us unto it, be a fooli&s;h and dangerous Adventure: if a &s;udden and unexpected Death may come and defeat all treacherous Hopes of this kind; if &s;uppo&s;e we do live to be Old, and had a long warning given us before we dy, (which yet is no good Policy to tru&s;t to:) we cannot tell by rea&s;on of <HI>the deceitful|ne&s;s of Sin,</HI> and our own Hearts together, and our often, contemning the Divine Grace alrea|dy, whether we &s;hall be in our right Sen&s;es, and capable to prepare for our <HI>Change</HI> or not; or whether God will uouch&s;afe to follow us with his de&s;pi&s;ed Grace any longer: It mu&s;t be confe&s;t on the force of all the&s;e Con&s;ide|rations, that we ought <HI>to day while it is called to day,</HI> without either Demur or Procra&s;tinati|on, to &s;et about our Duty in good earne&s;t; and that becau&s;e, whether we do this or not, we mu&s;t certainly Dy, and be called to a &s;trict Judgment in a very &s;hort Time: which brings me to my next Particular, to &s;hew.</P>
<P N="3">3. That whether we make a due prepara|tion for Death, or whether we forbear, 'tis
<PB N="16" REF="000833_0011_0FAB40BCE0A02088">
certain that will come, and indeed very quick|ly too. I am &s;en&s;ible, 'twere impertinent to prove, that all mu&s;t <HI>once Dy</HI>; this is &s;o well known, that it never was, nor ever will be doubted by any man in his right mind: but to tell people that they &s;hall Dy e're long, in I know not how &s;hort a Space, before they have time perhaps to confe&s;s their Sins, or to cry out for Mercy, is thought <HI>a hard &s;aying,</HI> and few there be that are both able and willing <HI>to bear it.</HI> 'Tis u&s;ual for men of di&s;&s;olute lives and Manners to disbelieve tho&s;e things that they do not like; they are firmly re&s;olved to put nothing in their Creed, but what makes for them. And this in &s;ome mea|&s;ure is the rea&s;on why many are &s;o hardly per&s;waded of the Propinquity or Nearne&s;s of their <HI>Dying Day.</HI> They know they mu&s;t part with their darling Vices, let it come when it will. They fear contrary to that fal&s;e Confi|dence and forced Bravery wherewith they were wont to deny the chief Articles of the Chri|&s;tian Faith, that things may prove in the End quite otherwi&s;e then was de&s;ired; that there is a Judge to Condemn, and a Devil to torment, an Heaven lo&s;t and forfeited, and an Hell which they mu&s;t unavoidably and irrecovera|bly be ca&s;t into</P>
<P>From hence therefore we may conclude that the Rea&s;on why men wont entertain the Belief of the&s;e things, is becau&s;e it goes Counter to
<PB N="17" REF="000833_0012_0FAB40BCE9A164F8">
their Wi&s;hes; (for Affection you know, is too apt to Bya&s;s Rea&s;on) and interfers with their Fancied Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But after all, it matters not how &s;ecure and confident &s;uch Athei&s;tical Per&s;ons are, that all Things will be <HI>Hereafter</HI> as they Suppo&s;e and Hope for <HI>Here.</HI> Nay (to come clo&s;er to the pre&s;ent De&s;ign) it &s;ignifies nothing what a Strong Pre&s;umption they pretend to have, that Death is a great way off; for 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that any Man barely fancying things to be at &s;uch or &s;uch a Di&s;tance from him, &s;hould pre&s;ently make 'em Vani&s;h <HI>When,</HI> and <HI>Whither</HI> He wou'd have them. 'Tis common for Children to imagine that the Tops of Mountains touch the very Skies, but the Mountains will never be removed to that height by Virtue of that Childi&s;h Imagination No more can He, that (being in perfect Health) pre&s;umes mo&s;t on a long Life, if Death is nearly tho' invi&s;ibly advancing towards him, either drive the ha&s;ty Me&s;&s;enger back, or make him keep at a remoter Di&s;tance, by the Strength and Peremp|torine&s;s of his Conceit. Alas! Death is as re&s;o|lute as we can be for our Lives, whatever we think of him, and will by little and little Steal upon us.</P>
<P>Men of twenty or thirty may Phancy that Death is in all likelihood far enough from them, and therefore will &s;corn to di&s;turb their Heads
<PB N="18" REF="000833_0013_0FAB40BDB3DB73A0">
about it yet; e&s;teeming it a point of Gallantry to defie it, and endeavour to blot out of their Minds all Apprehen&s;ions, Fears and Jealou&s;ies, at lea&s;t to &s;tiffe them for a while; but notwith|&s;tanding the Sand in the Gla&s;s runs down apace, without Stop or Intermi&s;&s;ion; and Time, Deaths Sub&s;titute and chief Officer, who&s;e Power no|thing can re&s;i&s;t or &s;cape, may for ought any bo|dy can tell mow them down in the prime of their Days, and <HI>mid&s;t of their Journey.</HI> By com|mon Experience, we may be convinc't upon how weak and infirm a Thread our Lives are hung, and what a perfect Hair it is that holds us from dropping into our Grave. Up|on the very Tombs of our deceas't Relati|ons we may read if we will, our own Frail|ty; They <HI>In&s;truct</HI> as well as <HI>Grieve</HI>; the Con&s;ideration of our Friends being there laid in a cold Bed of Earth, directs us to infer that we &s;hall &s;oon ly by his Side; and the Thoughts of his having been but a lit|tle before, perhaps more young and lively and brisk then we are, &s;uppo&s;eth that we have no Certainty that we &s;hall tarry long behind.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides, how frequently do we &s;ee with our own Eyes, many a &s;trong, healthy, robu&s;t Youth attended to his Burial by tho&s;e Companions, who&s;e weak and &s;ickly Con&s;ti|tution he was us'd to pitty? What a com|mon
<PB N="19" REF="000833_0014_0FAB40BE691C3738">
thing is it for the be&s;t and mo&s;t un|likely to Dy fir&s;t? How many &s;trange In|&s;tances of this Nature have we heard of within the Compa&s;s of &s;ome few Years? Nay, how many can our own Knowledge and Memory furni&s;h us withal? By odd and unaccountable Accidents are Multitudes brought to an unexpected End. 'Tis con&s;iderable, that the finer and more curious any thing is, the more ea&s;ily it may be corrupted and &s;poiled. We &s;ee this con&s;tantly verified in mo&s;t Ca&s;es; but in no one more apparently, than in that of Life and Health, which, (next to the Watchful Providence of God) depend principally on the good Decorum of this beautiful and regular Frame of Humane Nature, I mean the Body: So Numerous, and yet &s;o Nearly Linkt together, are all the Parts, &s;o various and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary their Functions, that the &s;malle&s;t matter almo&s;t can di&s;order, and this again go near to de&s;troy the admirable Contexture of it. A Blow upon the Head, or a Brui&s;e in the Fle&s;h, the Spraining of a Limb, or breaking a Vein, can Shatter the whole Frame into a Confu&s;ion, fatal and incurable. The Inflamation of the Spirits, or Defect of Vital Heat; an Empti|ne&s;s of the Ve&s;&s;els that &s;hou'd contain the Blood, or even a Superfluity of the Blood it &s;elf; a Di&s;ea&s;e, or a Wound may pall our Courage, Enervate our Strength, Stop our

Breath, and contrary to Expectation, put a quick Period to our Lives. Many a man has died in his Sleep, when all the while &s;uch as lay with him, knew nothing of the Matter; others have Died at Meals, when the Food, which they received into their Throats to nouri&s;h and &s;trengthen the Body, &s;tuck immoveably in the Pa&s;&s;age, and choaked them. Others moreover have been taken a|way in the very Act of Sinning. So we read, <HI>Act.</HI> 5. that <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira his Wife</HI> were &s;truck dead with a Ly in their Mouths.</P>
<P>And there are not wanting later Exam|ples of tho&s;e who have been &s;urprized in the very utterance of an Oath, an Impre|cation, a Calumny, or a Fal&s;hood. Who knows not that &s;ome have gone in&s;tantly from the heat of a Debauch, to the Fire of Hell; from wallowing in Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s to be tormented for ever; from Soaking in Drun|kenne&s;s, to <HI>Dwell with Everlasting Burnings</HI>; as it fared with the <HI>Rich man</HI> in the Go&s;pel, of whom it is recorded in Scripture, that Li|ving in the greate&s;t Splendour, and the En|joyment of all good things whatever his heart cou'd de&s;ire, he in the mid&s;t of all his Plenty, Died, and was <HI>turned into Hell</HI>; where we af|terwards find him crying out, and begging earne&s;tly for one drop of Water <HI>to Cool</HI> his Scorched <HI>Tongue,</HI> and to extingui&s;h the Flames

<P>I mention the&s;e things to repre&s;ent to you, as faithfully as I can, the Uncertainty, Empti|ne&s;s, and incon&s;iderable Vanity of our pre&s;ent State; that &s;o you may divert your Affecti|ons and Mind from it, and find a more proper Entertainment for them in preparing for a New <HI>Scene,</HI> a New and La&s;ting <HI>Scene,</HI> to be Shortly enter'd on; La&s;ting as the va&s;t incommen&s;urate Space of Eternity; and New as well becau&s;e we are Strangers to it yet, as that it will not Commence till our <HI>Acting</HI> here is ended.</P>
<P>But here it may not be ami&s;s to con&s;i|der further, that over and above this frailty (hitherto Chiefly di&s;cours't of) which is con|geneal with us, and proceeds immediately from the very Principles of our Con&s;tituti|on, there are innumerable accidental Ca&s;ual|ties that may happen to Come from abroad, and bring De&s;truction along with them.</P>
<P>So that let a man be temperate, and &s;o|ber

and cha&s;t, and not given to any of tho&s;e Vices, which in their own Nature, ha&s;ten Death; yet even then he cannot be &s;ecure with re&s;pect to his Temporal Safety; though to his great Comfort his Spiritual Part be out of Danger. The be&s;t of men are liable to de&s;perate Chances, and though the&s;e do not happen to <HI>All,</HI> yet <HI>all</HI> are in danger of them. And therefore the Que&s;tion which the Apo&s;tle puts in the ca&s;e of the Re&s;urrection, is no le&s;s applicable to this, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.30. El&s;e (&s;aith he) <HI>Why Stand we in Jeopardy every Hour? i e.</HI> in con&s;tant Dread of &s;ome Un&s;een Accident or other that may befal us, and pre&s;ently end our days, before we can be &s;en&s;ible of what has happened; or perceive by what means the Affliction came.</P>
<P>But if you be of Opinion, that all tho&s;e Di&s;quiets and Fears are the Effect of a deep Melancholly, or a di&s;turbed Imagination; &s;uch as ha' no Foundation in Nature, but are groundle&s;s and unrea&s;onable (which yet no man of Wi&s;dom or Sobriety can be in|duced to think.) I &s;hall take no other Me|thod to convince you, &s;ave only to de&s;ire you to examine your Memories, how fre|quently you have both heard and read of many Excellent and Worthy Per&s;ons that ha' been either Murthered, or Drown'd or Poi|&s;on'd,

or even by more uncouth and &s;trange Misfortunes then the&s;e brought to an Un|timely Death.</P>
<P>There are many Undeniable In&s;tances of this kind to be met with in <HI>Holy Scripture.</HI> Shall I put you in Mind of <HI>Abel,</HI> who (the Sacred Story tells us) received a Sudden but Mortal Wound from the bloody Hands of his own cruel Brother, and that for no other rea&s;on for ought we can find, but becau&s;e He and his Offering were re&s;pected by God? Or &s;hall I bring to your Remembrance the Violent di&s;patch of <HI>Abner</HI> the Renowned Cap|tain of <HI>Sauls</HI> Ho&s;t, <HI>Whom Joab took a&s;ide in the Gate, to &s;peak with him quietly and friend|ly; and &s;mote him under the Fifth Rib, that he died, as a Fool dieth</HI>; nay, <HI>as a man falleth before Wicked men:</HI> So fell this Great and Fa|mous General. In the 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3 <HI>Chap.</HI> is the whole Relation to be found, which you may peru&s;e at your lei&s;ure. In the like manner, I may ask you, if you never read how <HI>Uz|za</HI> was &s;mote down dead upon the place, becau&s;e he endeavoured to hold up the un|&s;teady Ark from falling? 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 13.9, 10. How all the innocent <HI>Children from two years Old and Under, that were in Bethlehem, and in all the Coa&s;ts thereof,</HI> fell in one night a Sa|crifice to the Malice and Cruelty of an en+raged <HI>Tyrant</HI>? St. <HI>Math.</HI> 2.16. Or la&s;tly, how
<PB N="24" REF="000833_0019_0FAB40C22929A8A0">
(not long after that Execrable <HI>Tragical</HI> Mur+ther was committed on the poor <HI>Infants,</HI> who had neither de&s;erv'd, nor cou'd hinder the Villanous Execution) <HI>John Baptist</HI> was Beheaded by the Command of the &s;ame in|&s;atiable Per&s;ecuter. Thus while the <HI>Good man</HI> was Preaching Repentance, and endea|vouring to Save the <HI>Lives of others,</HI> his un|grateful Auditors deprived him of <HI>his own.</HI> ver&s;. 20.</P>
<P>There might be produced, were it need|ful, a Multitude of &s;uch like Examples; and too frequent In&s;tances of Excellent Men, who have thus by &s;ome unthought of Calamity, or other, been &s;peedily and without Warn|ing; tran&s;lated from a <HI>bad</HI> to a <HI>better</HI> Re|gion.</P>
<P>And here we are not to imagine that the&s;e Hi&s;torical Relations are now imperti|nent, becau&s;e of a very ancient &s;tanding; and that they do not at all concern us, be|cau&s;e we are removed &s;o many Centuries from the re&s;pective Times when tho&s;e &s;eve|rall Facts were committed; for 'tis the A|po&s;tles affirmation, <HI>What&s;oever things were writ|ten aforetime, were written for our learning.</HI> Rom. 15.4.</P>
<P>But the truth is, 'tis no rare infrequent

thing for good men to be catcht away on a &s;udden, even in the&s;e latter days: what the <HI>Wi&s;e man</HI> &s;ays in another Ca&s;e, I may &s;ay in this, <HI>It is an evil that I have &s;een un|der the Sun, and it is common among Men.</HI> Nay, not among the Vicious and Prophane only, but even the better and more Religious &s;ort of them.</P>
<P>And yet granting for once, what howe|ver can't be allow'd that there are few or no Modern Examples of the&s;e di&s;cernable Misfortunes, yet (we know) what&s;oever has been, may be; and &s;urely if an Ill thing may betide any, and does frequently betide &s;ome, then every one is in&s;ecure.</P>
<P>So that they are extreamly to blame (if any &s;uch there be) who tho' they can't de|ny the Truth and Reality of the Ob&s;ervation in <HI>Former</HI> Ages, have yet the Confidence to pre&s;ume on an Indemnity in the <HI>Pre&s;ent</HI>; E&s;|pecially con&s;idering that the World as it grows in Age, &s;o it decayeth in Strength, and wax|eth wor&s;e and wor&s;e every day; and &s;eeing this is no le&s;s true of every particular thing in Nature, then of Nature it &s;elf: From hence it is but rea&s;onable to infer that we who come upon the <HI>Stage</HI> towards the Conclu&s;ion, and live in the declining State of the World, &s;hould be obnoxious to as <HI>many</HI> if not <HI>more</HI>

Evils, and Mi&s;chiefs, and &s;udden Deaths then tho&s;e were liable to, who came on the <HI>Stage</HI> very early, and acted but one or two <HI>Scenes,</HI> while as yet Sin the Cur&s;ed Patent of all, had not Exerted its Power and Impire &s;o prodigiou&s;|ly nor &s;o mi&s;erably En&s;lav'd Mankind as it has done of Late; nor perhaps did Mankind (the more is our &s;hame) &s;o tamely and Univer&s;ally &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>Let therefore tho&s;e who look back on the An|nals of Antiquity be &s;o far from thinking (if common Experience do not preclude &s;uch a Thought) that the things we &s;peak of are out|dated, that they &s;hou'd make an Experiment of the Truth of them (as far as po&s;&s;ible) upon them&s;elves by <HI>Dying Daily, i. e.</HI> by providing a|gain&s;t Death, and looking con&s;tantly for him every day, one after another, that &s;o the main Chance may be &s;ecured whatever happen, and that whether he Steals in, and lays his cold hands on them e're they perceive it, or whether he knocks before hand at their Doors, and pre|moni&s;heth them of his coming for them by and by, they may have no Bu&s;ine&s;s lying on their Hands to di&s;patch, no Will to make, nor Affairs to Settle in this World, nor any Accounts to make ready for a Future; yea, indeed not any thing to do, but to thank God for di&s;charging them from a trouble&s;ome hazardous Condition &s;o &s;oon, which they are now to Exchange for an

Unchangeable Happine&s;s, for a continuance in the Pre&s;ence of God, and Conver&s;ation with Glorious Angels and Glorified Saints above, and &s;o with a chearful and ready Complyance to embrace the Opportunity of <HI>Departing in Peace.</HI></P>
<P>And now, 'tis no doubt expected, I &s;hou'd di&s;cour&s;e &s;omething concerning the Party De|ceas't. I am not ignorant this Employment is not without Peril, as has been long ago ob&s;erv'd; for Friends, and tho&s;e that Lov'd their Memo|ry will think <HI>too Little,</HI> when others, either out of Ignorance or Envy will think <HI>too much</HI> is &s;po|ken; and I may on the <HI>One</HI> Hand be blamed for <HI>Partiality,</HI> and on the <HI>Other</HI> be charged with <HI>Flattery.</HI> And indeed it may be &s;ometimes Wi&s;|dom to be Sparing in &s;uch Exerci&s;es, referring the Commendation of the Dead to the Words of <HI>Solomon, Let her own Works prai&s;e her.</HI> But neverthele&s;s it cannot be denied but that this Ceremony is both ancient and imitable, as might be plentifully prov'd from Scripture, and the Writings of the Ancient Fathers. So that how|ever the Infirmities of Chri&s;tians ought to be buried, yet the Memorial of their Virtues is a Part of that civil Honour which we owe to tho&s;e who are departed this Life, and are at <HI>Re&s;t with God.</HI></P>
<P>But then it cannot be rea&s;onably expected, that I &s;hou'd di&s;cour&s;e <HI>much</HI> of One whom I but

<HI>lately knew,</HI> or relate ancient Pa&s;&s;ages of her <HI>Life,</HI> when mine Acquaintance was but of a Modern Date.</P>
<P>But &s;ince her coming to this place, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I ob&s;erv'd in Her a Kind and Affable and Virtuous Demeanour; and I charitably conclude a Vital Principle of true Piety and Virtue; a Love to God and Religion, and attendance on the Sacrament and other <HI>Means of Grace.</HI> During the Time of her Sickne&s;s, let none Uncharitably, and Unchri&s;tianly im|pute that to the <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> which was ju&s;tly char|geable on the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI>: I'm &s;ure while I atten|ded, &s;he manife&s;ted a Patient and Contented Frame of Spirit under Gods afflicting Hand, earne&s;tly de&s;ired <HI>my con&s;tant Prayers for Her; told me &s;he was very ready to re&s;ign her &s;elf to Gods di&s;po&s;al, and willing to Dy, if it plea&s;ed God, &s;he &s;hou'd &s;o now,</HI> &s;till praying to the la&s;t, that Almighty God wou'd Pitty and Pardon Her. And &s;oon after my Departure, calmly and ea&s;ily, without tho&s;e Struglings and Ago|nies that &s;ome Deaths are attended with, Re|&s;igned up her Spirit to God that Gave it, and as (I charitably Conclude, is now Entered into <HI>Re&s;t,</HI> and Lodged in the Man&s;ions of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>What then remains, but that we all <HI>Redeem the Time</HI>; earne&s;tly beg of God, <HI>to teach us
<PB N="29" REF="000833_0024_0FAB40C69A76EAE8">
