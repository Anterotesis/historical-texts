</FIGURE> BY The GOVERNOUR &amp; General COURT Of the COLONY of the <HI>Massachusetts Bay.</HI> In New-England.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT having been a thing too Sensible and Obvious to escape the Observation of all who are not wholly Strangers in our</HI> Israel; <HI>that this poor Land has laboured under a long</HI> Series <HI>of Afflicti|ons and Calamities, whereby we have suffered successively in our precious and pleasant Things, and have seen the Anger of the righteous God against us, expressed in Characters, which ought to be as</HI> Terrible <HI>as they must needs be visible unto us; it having also, both by the</HI> Testimonies <HI>of those, that after the most humble and exact Enquiries into the Mind of God, have discovered the same unto us, and by their own General and Repeated Confessions, become undeniable; That a</HI> Cor|ruption <HI>of Manners attended with Inexcusable</HI> Degeneracies <HI>and</HI> Apostasies, <HI>found in too many of this People, is the cause of that Controversie, which the God of our Fathers has, for many years been maintaining with us: It being likewise at this day, such a</HI> Probation-time <HI>with all</HI> New-England <HI>as this Countrey has never before seen from the first Foundation of it, and the Judgments of that Holy God, who hath beheld how incorrigible we have hitherto been under all His Dispensations, now arriving to such an Extremity, That</HI> the Ax is laid to the Root of the Trees, <HI>and we are in imminent danger of perishing, if a speedy REFORMATION of our</HI> Provoking Evils <HI>prevent it not</HI> THIS COURT have therefore thought it needful to praeface their other Endea|vours for the Publick Welfare, with a very solemn Admonition unto this whole People, that they every where give Demonstrations of a thorough <HI>Repentance,</HI> without which we have little reason to hope for any good success in our Affairs.</P>
<P>Wherefore it is Ordered, that the <HI>Laws</HI> of this Colony against <HI>Vice,</HI> and all sorts of <HI>Debauchery</HI> and <HI>Prophaness</HI> (which <HI>Laws</HI> have too much lost their edg by the late Inter|ruption of the Government) be now faithfully and Vigorously put in Execution; Parti|cularly the <HI>Laws</HI> against <HI>Blasphemy, Cursing, Prophane Swearing, Lying, Unlawful Gaming, Sabbath-breaking, Idleness, Drunkenness, Vncleanness, and all the Enticements, and Nurseries of such Impieties.</HI> Together with all other the wholsome <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> agreeable to the present Circumstances of the Countrey; by the Execution whereof, we may approve our selves <HI>a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="000530_0002_0FA6B40879332C58">And as all Persons are hereby warned to avoid those <HI>Vices</HI> which these <HI>Laws</HI> are designed for the Prevention and Chastisement of (the <HI>Lovers</HI> of, and <HI>Pleaders</HI> for, such Iniquities, being among the principal <HI>Troublers</HI> of their Countrey) So all inferiour <HI>Officers</HI> are enjoyn'd to perform their Duty in finding and bringing out Offenders against the aforesaid <HI>Laws,</HI> and withal to give notice to such Offenders that they must expect the Justice of an <HI>Exemplary Punishment.</HI></P>
<P>And that no attempt towards <HI>Reformation,</HI> may want that Assistance which all good men will be willing to give thereunto, 'tis hoped that the Ministers of God will to the publick Reading of this <HI>Proclamation,</HI> adjoyn their own fervent La|bours, not only for the Rebukeing and Suppressing of those <HI>Provoking Evils,</HI> which are marked for common Hatred: but also to witness against the more <HI>Spi|ritual Sins,</HI> which fall not so much under the cognizance of Humane <HI>Laws,</HI> namely, such as <HI>Vnbelief, Worldliness, Heresy, Pride, Wrath, Strife, Envy,</HI> and the <HI>Neglect</HI> of communion with God, in both Natural and Instituted <HI>Worship,</HI> and the <HI>Contempt</HI> of the <HI>everlasting Gospel,</HI> with a shameful want of due <HI>Family-Instruction,</HI> which are the <HI>Roots of Bitterness</HI> in the midst of us.</P>
<P>Moreover, after the Example of <HI>Pious Rulers</HI> commended in Sacred Writ; the <HI>Churches</HI> every where are hereby advised to give utmost Encouragement unto the Faithful and Watchful <HI>Pastors</HI> of their Souls; to seek (where they <HI>lack</HI>) a full Set|tlement and Enjoyment of such <HI>Officers,</HI> as the Lord Jesus Christ has appointed for their Edification; to reflect seriously and frequently on their <HI>Covenants,</HI> to sharpen their <HI>Discipline</HI> against those that <HI>walk disorderly</HI>; and immediately to compose their <HI>Differences</HI> and <HI>Contentions</HI> (if <HI>such</HI> there be) whereby any of them may be distempered and enfeebled, that so they may become <HI>Terrible as an Army with Banners.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore it is Expected that the several <HI>Towns</HI> within this Jurisdiction do speedily furnish themselves with all fit means for the good <HI>Education of Youth,</HI> and take special care to avoid <HI>Factions</HI> and <HI>Quarrels</HI> in their other <HI>Town Affairs</HI>; and all Plantations are strictly forbidden to continue without the Advantages of having the <HI>Word</HI> of God constantly preacht unto them, or without a Sincere and Active Industry, to obtain the Presence of the Lord Christ in all His blessed <HI>Ordinances.</HI></P>
<P>And Finally, this whole People are hereby advertised, that if these <HI>Essayes</HI> for an universal Reformation, shall be obstructed (as those in the dayes of the Reform|ing <HI>Josiah</HI> were) by Mens being <HI>settled on their Lees,</HI> and <HI>hating to be Reformed,</HI> they can reasonably look for no other issue than this, that the jealous God <HI>will pu|nish them yet seven times more for their iniquities:</HI> But, that if the God of Heaven shall grant unto them the Grace to <HI>Remember whence they are fallen, and Repent and do the first Works,</HI> it will give a greater Prospect of <HI>Prosperity,</HI> than can arise from the best <HI>Counsels,</HI> and biggest <HI>Armies.</HI></P>
<P>The Work of <HI>Reformation</HI> thus <HI>endeavoured,</HI> is now <HI>recommended</HI> unto the bles|sing of the Almighty, with whom alone it is, to Recover a Backsliding people; perswading our selves, that the Event thereof would be <HI>Salvation nigh unto us, and Glory dwelling in our Land.</HI></P>
