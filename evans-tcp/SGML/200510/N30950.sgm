<P>THE two following Odes were compos'd on their re&s;pective Oc|ca&s;ions, merely for the Author's Amu&s;ement and the Entertain|ment of his Friends; but their Importunity and favourable, not to &s;ay partial, Judgment of them, have induc'd him to pre&s;ent them to publick View, not without &s;ome Hope, that they may meet with a kind Reception, if not by their intrin&s;ick Merit, at lea&s;t by their Re|lation to tho&s;e important and intere&s;ting Events which gave them Birth.</P>
<P>As the Life of Lord <HI>HOWE</HI> was un&s;peakably valuable, &s;o his Death is, and it were a&s;toni&s;hing if it were not, mo&s;t &s;incerely and univer&s;ally lamented: And indeed I know not, whether the &s;ad Ca|ta&s;trophe which &s;ucceeded his Fall, tho' attended with the Lo&s;s of &s;o many Lives, has occa&s;ion'd more Regret, than the &s;ingle Fate of that illu&s;trious and prom&s;ing young Hero. But the Reduction of <HI>Loui&s;|bourg</HI> to his <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty mu&s;t needs give inexpre&s;&s;ible Plea&s;ure, and afford a mo&s;t delightful Pro&s;pect, to every one, in proportion as he apprehends its Importance to, and prizes the Welfare of, the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>America,</HI></P>
<P>In this View of Things, and a critical Humour apart, the Au|thor hopes the&s;e Performances with all their Faults (which he is ig|norant of) may afford a plea&s;ing Entertainment to his Fellow Subjects, even at this Di&s;tance of Time; and if &s;o, he wou'd have been glad if his Di&s;tance from the Pre&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had not prevent|ed their being &s;omewhat more &s;ea&s;onable.</P>
<P>If the Character of Lord <HI>HOWE</HI> be, as doubtle&s;s it is, incompleat it mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd that this Sketch of it was copied from the Voice of Fame; and if any Gentlemen of the Army or Navy &s;eem to be neg|lected, or not mention'd according to their Rank, in the Ode on the Reduction of <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> I hope it will be imputed rather to the Ignorance than the Partiality, of</P>
