<HEAD>THE INTEREST OF <HI>City</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> To lay No DUTIES.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEREAS there has been of late much Di&s;|cour&s;e concerning the Du|ties on Merchandize, for Support of Government; &s;ome being for having Duties continu|ed, and &s;ome not; &s;ome being for continuing &s;ome Duties, and taking off others, and laying &s;ome New, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003290_0003_0FF033895CA4EA90">I think it may not be ami&s;s for me to communicate my Thoughts con|cerning this Affair, which, I am &s;ati&s;|fied, would be for the Good and Ad|vantage of City and Country, if put in Practice, and no ways detrimental to the Government: For, con&s;idering the great Benefits that we enjoy, by a well regulated and happy Govern|ment, I think we &s;hould be very Ungrateful, if we did not take Care &s;ufficiently to &s;upport the &s;ame; which I hope we &s;hall all agree to. And therefore all the Que&s;tion is, <HI>How or after what Manner this may be&s;t be ac|compli&s;hed, for the Benefit and Ea&s;e of the City and Country in general, and with the lea&s;t Burthen to the People, and with the lea&s;t Prejudice to Trade and Indu&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place I &s;hall &s;hew <HI>How that the Laying Duties on Merchandize is very much to the Di&s;advantage of both City and Country,</HI> as is found by Experience: And that, on the Con|trary, <HI>The taking them off, and having Trade free, would be greatly to the Ad|vantage
<PB N="5" REF="003290_0004_0FF0338B973B5B70">
and for the Intere&s;t of both.</HI></P>
<P>I believe that it will be readily granted, that Trade and Commerce is that which conduces much to the Pro&s;perity and Enriching of both Ci|ty and Country; and, that whatever hinders and di&s;courages Trade, hurts both City and Country: For as the City cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the Coun|try, &s;o the Country cannot well &s;ub|&s;i&s;t nor thrive without the City, which they depend on for the taking of their Produce, and furni&s;hing them with many Nece&s;&s;aries, which they cannot well be without: So that whatever hinders the Country from Selling their Produce for a good Price, and likewi&s;e is a Cau&s;e of their Pay|ing dearer for what they buy, mu&s;t needs be very Prejudicial to them. And that the Duties on Merchandize is a Cau&s;e of both the&s;e Evils, I think is undeniable, and can be very ea&s;ily proved, in general and in particular. For although &s;ome Duties do more affect the Country than others, yet (with Submi&s;&s;ion to better Judgments)
<PB N="6" REF="003290_0005_0FF0338E44A10348">
I think all are Hurtful. For if we con&s;ider Things rightly, we &s;hall find that the Country pays mo&s;t of the Duties, though oftentimes in&s;en&s;ibly. For though it is true the Merchant pays it fir&s;t, yet he generally takes Care afterwards to &s;ell his Goods for a Price accordingly: And mo&s;t of the Goods that are Imported and pay Duty, being &s;old to, and expended in, the Country, con&s;equently the Coun|try pays it, by paying &s;o much dear|er than otherwi&s;e they need to do; which I &s;uppo&s;e very few, if any, will deny. But if any &s;hould, it is very ea&s;ily proved in the general, and in divers Particulars, which I &s;hall con&s;ider anon. And al&s;o Du|ties in General are very Prejudicial to the Country, on Account of their &s;elling the Produce they rai&s;e; &s;o that if there was a Free Trade, they might &s;ell what they rai&s;e at a better Price than otherwi&s;e they can Expect to do; for as it is well known that the Duties have oftentimes been a Cau&s;e of driving Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="003290_0006_0FF03390CD10C9A0">
from this Province to our Neighbours, and di&s;couraging our Neighbours from coming to trade with us, it mu&s;t needs be hurtful to us in General.</P>
<P>Now as to the particular Duties that are paid, we may con&s;ider the Hurt that each does to the City and Country in particular. And fir&s;t as to <HI>Wine,</HI> which does not &s;o much affect the Country as City, yet it is not all Drunk in the City, the Coun|try has &s;ome Part of it, and &s;o con|&s;equently pays &s;ome Part of the Du|ty: Now if &s;ome Duties mu&s;t be continued, I think this on Wine may as well or better than any other; be|cau&s;e it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that, ge|nerally &s;peaking, tho&s;e that drink the mo&s;t of it are pretty able, both in City and Country; and &s;o may be be&s;t able to pay towards the Support of Government, which it is intended for; and does not fall on the Poorer &s;ort of People that are not able to bear it, as &s;ome other Things do. Neither will the Di&s;couragement of
<PB N="8" REF="003290_0007_0FF0339317DCFE58">
that be &s;o hurtful to the Country o|therwi&s;e as &s;ome other Things are: &s;o I &s;hall &s;ay the le&s;s again&s;t it, and proceed to <HI>Rum,</HI> which more affects the Country, the greate&s;t Part of it being u&s;ed there (whether well u&s;ed or a|bu&s;ed, I think not pertinent to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to di&s;cour&s;e of) for certain it is that the Country will have it, whether cheap or dear; &s;o that con&s;equently they pay the Duty that Drink it, almo&s;t in general, both Rich and Poor: For when there is no Duty on it, the Merchant can &s;ell it cheaper, and when he pays Duty he mu&s;t and does &s;ell it dearer, as Experience proves; &s;o to talk of di&s;|couraging it, by a Duty, is in vain. Be&s;ides it would be a Contradiction, for &s;uch as will have the Duty to help &s;upport Government, to talk of Di&s;|couraging it; for if it &s;hould do &s;o, <HI>pray how would it an&s;wer the End for which the Duty is laid? viz.</HI> Sup|port the Government: So that if the Duty &s;hould di&s;courage the Importa|tion, we mu&s;t &s;eek for another Way
<PB N="9" REF="003290_0008_0FF03396D829EDA8">
for Support of Government, which we may do without it, as I &s;hall after make appear. Now, it may be con&s;idered, that it would not be any Advantage to the Country to hinder the Importation of <HI>Rum,</HI> con&s;idering that we purcha&s;e it with the Produce of the Country, without Money, and thereby encourage Manufacture, Na|vigation, and many Trades that de|pend on it, which would Suffer if we di&s;couraged the Importation and Trade of <HI>Rum, Molo&s;&s;us</HI> and other Things from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI>: How could we expect they would trade with us, if we refu&s;e to take of the Produce of tho&s;e Countries, partly in lieu for our Flour, Bread, Bacon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>If any &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Why, bring back Money in Return for our Flour,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and &s;o make Money plenty here.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay, that we do, in Part, already enough to make Money plenty here, if we had not another Way for it; and it may be as much as they can well &s;pare us; &s;o that if we &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on having our Returns all in
<PB N="10" REF="003290_0009_0FF033998E825B00">
Money, it might de&s;troy our Trade. And as for the Notion of di&s;coura|ging Vice by it, I think it frivolous, as not being &s;ufficient to do it; for tho&s;e that love &s;trong Drink, will have it one Way or another: &s;o that there will need &s;ome other Method for that of di&s;couraging Vice, which I think not proper to di&s;cour&s;e of here.</P>
<P>Now as to the Duty on <HI>Molo&s;&s;us,</HI> I think that it is a Hard&s;hip, that falls mo&s;tly on the Poore&s;t Part of the City and Country who mo&s;tly u&s;e it, and that for very nece&s;&s;ary U&s;es (and not to encourage Vice) and they could not well do without it, for <HI>Honey</HI> is &s;carce here and what <HI>Sweets</HI> might be made of <HI>Cyder</HI> I know not, but I believe little in Compari&s;on of the <HI>Molo&s;&s;us</HI> the Country expends, nor &s;o good nor &s;uitable neither. So that it would certainly be a great Hard|&s;hip on the Country to di&s;courage the Importation, as well as it is &s;ome Hard&s;hip to make them pay dearer for it than they need to do, were Trade free without any Duties.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003290_0010_0FF033AAA56F7730">Next as to <HI>Salt,</HI> it is generally agreed on all Hands, <HI>That it were better to have no Duty on that,</HI> &s;o I &s;hall &s;ay the le&s;s to it, we having &s;o lately had plentiful Experience to confirm it to general Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Another con&s;iderable Branch of Re|venue is <HI>the Duty on Negroes,</HI> which, it is very certain, the Country in general payes the mo&s;t of <HI>viz.</HI> all tho&s;e that Buy them. For it mu&s;t be the &s;ame by them as other Things, in that Re&s;pect, <HI>that though the Mer|chant payes it fir&s;t, he, when he &s;ells them, advances the more on the Price.</HI> If any &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>It may be well to di&s;courage the Importation of them, there be|ing enough in the Country already.</HI> I &s;ay, then let the Duty be &s;o great as to an&s;wer that End, otherwi&s;e the Ob|jection is frivolous, and then if &s;o, it an&s;wers not the End for which it has been laid, <HI>viz. Support of Govern|ment,</HI> which we are now upon.</P>
<P>The Duty on <HI>Cocoa</HI> is another Ar|ticle which is paid by all tho&s;e that buy and &s;pend <HI>Chocolate,</HI> which though
<PB N="12" REF="003290_0011_0FF0339B1A071600">
it mo&s;tly affects the City, yet the Coun|try is al&s;o partly concerned in it.</P>
<P>Another is the Duty of 5 <HI>per Ct.</HI> or 7 and an half <HI>per Ct.</HI> on <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Goods imported from the Neighbour|ing Plantations, and not directly from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which &s;ome have thought to be for the Advantage of this Pro|vince, but I am of another Mind: For what does it concern the greate&s;t Part of the People in this Province (e&s;pecially the Country) how the Goods are imported hither, whether directly or round about, provided they can have them as cheap as if they all came directly. And if they could not be afforded as cheap when they come from other Places to us, as tho&s;e that come directly, then that of it &s;elf would di&s;courage the Trade, without any Duty being laid on them. But I can make it appear that it would be better for this Province in general <HI>not to di&s;courage &s;uch Importation, be|cau&s;e what we have &s;o imported does not co&s;t us Money, whereas our Impor|tation from</HI> Great Britain <HI>drains this
<PB N="13" REF="003290_0012_0FF033AD8FCCA998">
Province of Money which otherwi&s;e might be plenty.</HI> Now let us con&s;ider, par|ticularly <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and other Parts of <HI>New-England,</HI> takes off largely of the Produce of this Country, but finds it difficult to make us Returns; Money they have not, nor but little el&s;e that we want, but are often forced to pay us in <HI>Briti&s;h Goods,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Duty. Now it is ea&s;y to con|ceive that if that were taken off, it would encourage our Trade with them. But then it may be objected, <HI>That would le&s;&s;en our Trade with</HI> Great Bri|tain. I &s;ay, <HI>Let it be &s;o, the better for the Country; for it would not le&s;&s;en our Exportation thither, but only our Im|portation, which would &s;ave our Money.</HI> So by what is above&s;aid, without en|larging, it plainly appears that it would be better for this Province to take off that Duty.</P>
<P>Another Thing to be con&s;idered is <HI>The Tunnage on Ve&s;&s;els not built in this Pro|vince,</HI> which &s;eems more difficult to de|termine than any of the Re&s;t: But I am entirely of the Mind <HI>that it is be&s;t to
<PB N="14" REF="003290_0013_0FF0339DA9804C50">
have Trade free and to have no Duties at all.</HI> So I think it be&s;t to take off this Duty al&s;o. And although there may be con&s;iderable Rea&s;ons advanced in favour of this Duty; yet I think I can advance as good again&s;t it. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable Arguments for it are, <HI>That it keeps the Trade of Building in our own Province.</HI> This I mu&s;t own con&s;iderable to the Ship-Carpenters, Smiths and &s;ome other Trades-men, but does not affect the greate&s;t Part of the City, nor the Country hardly at all.</P>
<P>Another Rea&s;on is, <HI>It keeps out Foreigners, e&s;pecially the</HI> Bermudians, <HI>who come here to get what they can, and there is little to be got by them,</HI> &amp;c. This I al&s;o own to be a con&s;iderable Plea, but I think it chiefly concerns the Builders and &s;ome owners of Ve&s;|&s;els, and not the Country in general. But I am of Opinon. That the En|couraging the <HI>Bermudians,</HI> and all o|thers, by a Free Trade, would be for the general Good of City and Country, (though not of every par|ticular
<PB N="15" REF="003290_0014_0FEFDAE1960F3780">
Per&s;on) as I will endeavour to make appear. But by the Way I think it may not be ami&s;s to explain what I mean by <HI>a Free Trade,</HI> which is on|ly with the Subjects of the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and <HI>not any Foreigners in|deed, that is People of other Nations or Kingdoms.</HI> For I think that the Word <HI>Foreigners</HI> is improper to the <HI>Bermudians,</HI> or any of our Neighbours and fellow Subjects, though belonging to different Provinces and Plantations or Governments. And now though the <HI>Bermudians,</HI> as above&s;aid, come to get, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet they generaly bring us plenty of <HI>Salt,</HI> and did afford it us cheap, before they were di&s;couraged by the <HI>Tunnage</HI> and <HI>Duty on Salt,</HI> which has much hindred them and others of late; and it is well known we have paid for it &s;ince, which has affected the Country in ge|neral, which ought to be more re|garded than the Advantage of a few particular Per&s;ons. Be&s;ides it very of|ten hinders our Trade in the Expor|tation of the Produce of the Country,
<PB N="16" REF="003290_0015_0FF033A02F7D6110">
which is undeniably prejudicial to the whole in &s;everal Re&s;pects.</P>
<P>I will give you one In&s;tance there|of, to make it appear plain, and that is, <HI>La&s;t Year here came a Ship into this Harbour, loaden with</HI> Salt, <HI>which we very much wanted, and would have Traded with us for</HI> Wheat <HI>and</HI> Staves, <HI>&amp;c. but by Rea&s;on of the Tunnage and Duty being &s;o heavy, went away to</HI> Am|boy, <HI>(and for no other Rea&s;on,)</HI> which was a con&s;iderable Di&s;advantage to City and Country. And thus our Duties and Impo&s;itions drive Stran|gers and Trade from us to our Neigh|bours, who are Gaping for it, and may well Laugh at us for our Pains, &s;eeing they could no ways get it from us, did not we give it them. By what is above &s;aid, with much more that might be &s;aid, we may ob&s;erve, that it is a groundle&s;s No|tion which &s;ome have entertained, <HI>viz. That when the Government is Support|ed by Duties on Trade, that it falls on the Merchants and City, and that the Country pays little of it:</HI> For it will,
<PB N="17" REF="003290_0016_0FF033B1A9F7DDB0">
I doubt not, appear plain to tho&s;e that rightly con&s;ider it, <HI>That the Coun|try pays the mo&s;t of it, and the Di&s;cou|ragement of Trade, which is, and mu&s;t be the Effects of it, if continued, affects the Country more than &s;ome of them are aware of.</HI></P>
<P>Now con&s;idering that our Neigh|bouring Provinces are Free Ports, and Support Government other ways, for to draw Trade thither, is it not high|ly Rea&s;onable for us <HI>to be Wi&s;e and Prudent in this Matter, by taking of all Ob&s;tructions and Hindrances that are already on Trade, and by being carefull of Incouraging it for the future.</HI> We may con&s;ider how that in the next Province they are continually con|triving and making Laws to increa&s;e Trade in their own Province, and to draw it from us; which has already proved Effectual &s;everal times, &s;ome|thing of which is above ob&s;erved. And &s;hall we be &s;o far wanting to our &s;elves, as not to con&s;ider our own Intere&s;t in endeavouring to pre|vent it, which as yet we may ea&s;ily
<PB N="18" REF="003290_0017_0FF033A2D1C0FBA0">
do, but if we do not do it in time, I doubt we &s;hall repent when it is too late; and I am fully of the Mind that there is no other way to pre|vent it, but by making our Port as Free as theirs. They can Support Government without Duties and Im|po&s;itions on Trade, and why may not we; I am &s;atisfied we are as well a|ble as they.</P>
<P>The next Thing to be con&s;idered is, <HI>how Government &s;hall be Supported without the Duties, and that both bet|ter and ea&s;ier for both City and Country in general</HI>; and that is by a general Tax on Mens E&s;tates, in both City and Country, which is the mo&s;t ju&s;t and equal Way that has yet been Practi&s;ed, that I know of, for this is no Ob&s;truction to Trade nor Manu|facture. Nor has it any of tho&s;e In|conveniencies attending it, that, more or le&s;s, attend, or may attend, all other ways that have or can be propo&s;ed. This way the Burthen does not lie on the City alone, nor on the Coun|try alone, but each bears an equal
<PB N="19" REF="003290_0018_0FF033B551AC6A00">
Proportion, according to their Abili|ties. Neither does the Burthen fall heavy on the Poor, for they that have little, will pay but little: So there will be no ju&s;t cau&s;e of Complaint either in City or Country, by Poor, Rich or tho&s;e in a middle Station: Whereas mo&s;t other ways fall heavy on &s;ome, while others that are better able, go quite free, nay oftentimes make a Gain by their Neighbours Lo&s;|&s;es, which I think needful to be pre|vented as much as po&s;&s;ible. This way of rai&s;ing a Support for Government, is al&s;o much ea&s;ier and better than by Duties, on &s;everal Accounts; for the Money is rai&s;ed with much le&s;s Charge and Trouble then the other, and will be more certain, the others having often failed of&punc; rai&s;ing the Sums ex|pected, and &s;o fallen &s;hort in an&s;wer|ing the End propo&s;ed, partly by rea|&s;on of the Difficulty and Charge at|tending the gathering of them in; &s;o that I believe we may &s;afely con|clude, <HI>That two Thou&s;and Pounds, rai|&s;ed by Tax, will bring as much Money,
<PB N="20" REF="003290_0019_0FF033A5559CA378">
or more, into the Trea&s;ury clear, as three Thou&s;and Pounds rai&s;ed by Duties.</HI></P>
<P>Now, is it not much better for the Province to pay <HI>two Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> than <HI>three Thou&s;and,</HI> if it will as well an&s;wer the End? And is it not as good and as well for the Govern|ment <HI>to be &s;upported one Way as the other, provided it be as &s;ufficient and more certain?</HI> Nay we may very well afford a larger Supply this Way than the other, and yet be great Gainers by it.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be objected, <HI>That the Legi&s;lature of</HI> Great Britain <HI>have, by long Experience, found that it is the be&s;t Way to &s;upport Government by Duties, and that it is the Practice of other Na|tions al&s;o.</HI> I &s;ay, <HI>Suppo&s;e we allow that, yet it will not prove it to be &s;o here; our Ca&s;e differs va&s;tly from theirs, con&s;idering we are only a &s;mall Province, &s;cituate in the mid&s;t of &s;everal others, which are free of the&s;e Duties; and &s;o we are continually in Danger of loo&s;ing our Trade to them, as is already ob&s;erved. It mu&s;t be owned, that if our neighbouring Pro|vinces
<PB N="21" REF="003290_0020_0FF033B776E223F0">
paid the like Duties as we, it would not be &s;o inconvenient for us to do the &s;ame, but &s;eeing their Ports are Free, ours ought to be &s;o too.</HI></P>
<P>And I hope our Superiours will take this into Con&s;ideration, and that the Country will be &s;en&s;ible that they have been under a Mi&s;take, in thinking <HI>That if the Government be &s;upported by Duties, it is the City does it; and that if by a general Tax, they do it:</HI> For, by what I have &s;aid, they may very ea&s;ily &s;ee it is otherwi&s;e. And they actually pay a large Share of it when it is paid by Duties, and no more than their Share when by a general Tax on all our E&s;tates: For if the City be &s;o much richer than the Country, as is &s;aid, they will be to pay &s;o much the more.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould object and &s;ay, <HI>This Way of Supporting Government by a general Tax will fall heavy on &s;ome Men that have large E&s;tates in land that is unimproved, and &s;o bring in little or no Profit, whil&s;t other Men that have great Incomes by Money at Intere&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>may pay but little.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="003290_0021_0FF033A832BA4848">I an&s;wer as to the fir&s;t, <HI>The Re|medy is in their own Hands, they may di&s;po&s;e of their Land, or let others im|prove it if they cannot do it them&s;elves. Be&s;ides I am of Opinion that it may be well to di&s;courage &s;uch Engro&s;ers of great Tracts of Land and not improv|ing them, it being a Wrong to both King and Country.</HI> As concerning the other who&s;e E&s;tates lie chiefly in Ca&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and not vi&s;ible to the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors It may be well to have it ordered for them (and others too) <HI>to give an Account of their own E&s;tates.</HI> And indeed if all Men were to give an Account of their own E&s;tates to the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, it might be more equal than it often times now is: For can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors can know what all Men's E&s;tates are, in a Town or Ward (if they were always impar|tial;) which may be the Rea&s;on that there is often &s;uch Complaints, <HI>That &s;ome are over rated, and others under ra|ted</HI>; whereas if every Man gives a true Account of his own E&s;tate, or as near as he can well, and be rated accor|dingly,
<PB N="23" REF="003290_0022_0FF033B933F41838">
it might prevent &s;uch Com|plaints, and be more equal and ju&s;t.</P>
<P>But if, notwith&s;tanding all that can be &s;aid, our Legi&s;lature &s;hould think good to continue &s;ome Duties, though not all, then let them continue the Duties on <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Negroes imported,</HI> the&s;e being lea&s;t prejudicial to the Trade of the Country, and by all Means take off all other, and make it up by a general Tax. But by no Means lay any <HI>Pole-tax on Negroes al|ready in the Province,</HI> for that would be very hard on &s;ome and not at all affect &s;ome others better able.</P>
<P>Thus I have, in &s;hort, given my Sentiments concerning the&s;e Things, which, I am &s;atisfied, may be for the Good of City and Country, if well con&s;idered and accordingly prac|ti&s;ed.</P>
