(For the Lord fills the Soul with him&s;elf, and known unto the Lord are all his works from the beginning) But becau&s;e God delights to hear, that we thankfully <HI>own</HI> and ac|knowledge it. <HI>Thou art with me, David</HI> &s;peaks it upon his knees, and with his Harp in his hands he &s;ings it. This Le&s;&s;on, Lord I learnt of thee, wilt thou plea&s;e to hear it. Thou art with me, in

<P>Prayer, what is it, but a flight of the Soul from it &s;elf to God? A Soul af|fected with divine love hath Doves eyes, its prayers hath Doves wings and flies with Letters of credence at its feet from the &s;pirit within our Temples, un|to the holy Oracle within the Vail.</P>
