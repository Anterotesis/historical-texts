<HEAD>The Addre&s;s Of the Honorable the Lieutenant Governour Stoughton, In the Name of Him&s;elf and of His Maje&s;ties COUNCIL of the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> unto His Excellency the Earl of BELLOMONT, immediate|ly after His <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI>'s having made His Speech unto the General A&s;&s;embly of &s;aid Province, at His fir&s;t meeting of them, on the
<DATE>Second day of <HI>June,</HI> 1699.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Day Shines mo&s;t happily upon us, wherein we &s;ee and enjoy Your Excellency Seated in the Chair of Govern|ment over this His Maje&s;ties Province, and Entered upon the Exerci&s;e thereof, to the great content of all.</P>
<P>I may well &s;ay this day, ina&s;much as this Your Excellency's Pre&s;ence is that which makes it to be more Day with us than lately it hath been, &s;ince it cannot more properly or fitly be lookt upon than as the Ri&s;ing of that greater Light of a more con&s;picuous Orb, and proportionable Influences, which nature hath appointed to di&s;tingui&s;h and rule the day,</P>
<P>We may truly &s;ay, That our long Expectation of Your Excellency hath been an Expectation with De&s;ire; and we now begin to find that true which the Wi&s;e man tells us, <HI>That when the De&s;ire cometh, it is a Tree of Life</HI>; Long may it Root and Flouri&s;h, that we may long &s;it under the Shadow, and Enjoy the Fruit thereof.</P>
<P>Had not Your Excellencys particular In&s;tructions, and His Maje&s;ties more E&s;pecial Service in another Province belonging to Your Lord&s;hips Government, nece&s;&s;arily prevented, we had much &s;ooner Enjoyed this days happine&s;s: For &s;ure we are, Your Lord&s;hip hath put no needle&s;s De|lays upon us, having more than redeemed all the time that hath been &s;pent el&s;ewhere, in doing tho&s;e great and nece&s;&s;ary things there brought to pa&s;s;
<PB N="2" REF="039346_0002_10141E67AACF2AE0">
and in the mean time not omitting to give unto us early and repeated A&s;|&s;urances of Your Lord&s;hips favourable inclinations and forwardne&s;s to be coming to us, and of Your having Entertained us very far into Your good Opinion and Good-Will, for which we do mo&s;t humbly return our mo&s;t Sincere Acknowledgments.</P>
<P>And &s;ince our Turn is &s;o happily come at la&s;t, we will not begrudge, but Congratulate unto our Neighbours, that they have been &s;o long the fir&s;t in reaping the &s;ignal Fruits of your Lord&s;hips Government among&s;t them Ad|mini&s;tred with &s;o much care and indefatigablene&s;s; &s;o much Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice, and &s;uch a fixed re&s;olution and zeal expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t things evil, and to be di&s;countenanced. And this we do the more freely, becau&s;e that from this experience of theirs, it comes to pa&s;s, that we now receive Your Excellency more nearly known and under&s;tood, unto the greater, not only Confirmation, but al&s;o Enlargement of all our Expectations for our &s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI></P>
<P>All men mu&s;t needs take notice, but none can with the like Sen&s;e and Concernment as our &s;elves, how highly His Maje&s;ty hath honoured &amp; dig|nified this Province in placing over us Your Excellency, a per&s;on of &s;o high and great Quality, noble in degree, and much more noble otherwi&s;e; who have &s;tood &s;o much in publick view for Merits and Services greater than ordinary, and who have in most Honourable Imployment &s;tood &s;o near, and been &s;o acceptable to His Maje&s;ty, and His Late Royal Con&s;ort our late Soveraign Lady. Your Lord&s;hips Honour &s;hall be ours, and the Lu&s;tre of Your Name and Character &s;hall be reflected upon us, &s;o as to ad|vance &amp; encrea&s;e our reputation from this day forward in the world. And &s;ince <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the great di&s;tance that we His Maje&s;ties Subjects here do &s;tand in from His Sacred Per&s;on: Your Lord&s;hip is placed as the Great Medium of Intercour&s;e and Communication: We mo&s;t thankfully and joyfully ac|count our &s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this day of a greater advantage than ever heretofore, by rea&s;on of Your Excellencys Interpo&s;ition, and the Improve|ment of Your Intere&s;t for us both in making our mo&s;t humble Addre&s;&s;es and Applications to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and in the obtaining thence all tho&s;e Favours, Supports and Cheri&s;hings of Supream Authority, which we do, and &s;o often &s;hall &s;tand in need of, without the lea&s;t doubt of Succe&s;s; Having KING <HI>WILLIAM</HI> the Third, the Glorious Deliverer and Re&s;torer of Three Kingdoms, the Bulwark of the true Prote&s;tant Religion, and all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberties: Mo&s;t Princely, mo&s;t Ju&s;t, mo&s;t rightfully appointed, Heavens Care, the Father of all His People, and the be&s;t of Kings, to Reign over us.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The good people of this Province (as hath already been more publickly &s;ignified) cannot, nor indeed ought they to forget that great difference of Intere&s;t and De&s;ign, upon which their Fathers and Predece&s;&s;ors, truly Great and Good Men in this re&s;pect, did with &s;o much co&s;t and hazard, tran&s;port them&s;elves and &s;ettle this wilderne&s;s: Mo&s;t other Plantations declared for nothing more than Trade and Gains; but tho&s;e good men publickly Owned that of Religion. That they and theirs might more freely Enjoy the Wor&s;hip and Ordinances thereof; That their Children might be Educated more free from the growing Vices and Debauche|ries of other places, that they might be brought up in a Land where
<PB REF="039346_0003_10141E69795DB6F8">
the Examples of Piety, Sobriety, Diligence, Strict Ob&s;ervation of Gods Holy Sabbaths; and all other Vertues and Good Behaviour might be more abundantly in their View. The Settlement of the&s;e things under the Government and Royal Charter then obtained, was the Fir&s;t Set|tlement which they chiefly laboured in. The Enjoyment of the&s;e was the fir&s;t and principal Enjoyment which they took contentment in. And from tho&s;e times, SIR, until now, the &s;ame Intere&s;t and De&s;ign hath (Thanks be to God) continued in &s;ome good mea&s;ure the great Standard and Rule whereby this people have made an E&s;timate of all their Concernments. By this they have judged of Things and Per&s;ons, of them&s;elves and others, and of the Times and Providences that have pa&s;&s;ed over us. Whil&s;t they have kept up to this great De&s;ign, they have reckon'd them&s;elves to be going forward, but otherwi&s;e to be go|ing backward: When Divine Providences have Smiled on them as to the&s;e things, they have ever thought them&s;elves to enjoy much of the Fa|vour of Heaven; but otherwi&s;e to be under its Frowns. When it was in their power, they have ever Cho&s;en &s;uch to be Over them in chiefe&s;t place as were Lovers, and would be Promoters of this Great Intere&s;t and De&s;ign, and the great things mentioned under the &s;ame. And all this I take the boldne&s;s thus plainly to mention to Your Lord&s;hip, that I may al&s;o as plainly &s;ay, that one great and principal cau&s;e of the joy and thankfulne&s;s of this day, is, that God and the King have made &s;o favoura|ble a Choice for us, that in the Per&s;on of Your Excellency we do at this time receive a Captain General and Governour in Chief, who hath given &s;o many and great proofs of His great E&s;teem of Sincere Love to, and Care for all the&s;e Things; and by who&s;e Example and Authority, as a Patron and Favourer, they may be promoted and &s;ecured to us; and all that which is contrary and de&s;tructive of them, Di&s;couraged and Suppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>As to the State of the Province, Your Lord&s;hip will &s;oon fully acquaint Your Self therewith, and therein I am not &s;o confident that you will not find many things, and &s;ome material ones, out of order, as I am, that by Your Excellencys Authority, Happy Conduct, and Univer&s;al Influence, a favourable, proper and &s;peedy Remedy will be given to them all: Each Order and Degree among&s;t us, co-operating with Your Excellency thereun|to, as in Duty we are bound: Nor do we doubt, but that in judging of our Affairs, and of the Management of the la&s;t Years, Your Lord&s;hip will make favourable Allowances for the Emergencies, Difficulties and Di&s;tractions of the late War, that continued &s;o long, and did &s;o &s;orely pre&s;s upon us; from all which we rejoyce, that Your Excellency, in Your Time, &s;hall be &s;o happily delivered; and that we &s;hall &s;o &s;ea&s;onably receive Your Excel|lencys A&s;&s;i&s;tances unto the Improvement, better Settlement and Enjoyment of that Peace, which through the pro&s;perou&s;ne&s;s of His Maje&s;ties Great and Glorious Undertakings in <HI>Europe,</HI> we do at this day &s;o far &s;ee the be|ginning of</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not now call them Enemies whom we have found to be the mo&s;t pernicious of all other. I mean our <HI>French</HI> Neighbours; but Your Excellency under&s;tands them well enough; and will as well watch and counterwork them in all their &s;ini&s;ter and crafty methods and underminings; Since they cannot but everla&s;tingly adhere to all their Envyings of us, and
<PB N="4" REF="039346_0004_10141E6B264A5670" MS="y">
of our Pro&s;perity; and to their mo&s;t unju&s;t De&s;igns of Encroaching upon us&punc; as to the Bounds, Rights and Priviledges, of this and all other His Maje&s;ties Provinces bordering upon them.</P>
<P>But by this time I have too long delayed Your Lord&s;hip and the pub|lick Occa&s;ions of the Day. I have only therefore to add for my &s;elf, that as it was a great Honour done me, and far greater than I could rea&s;onably ever a&s;pire unto, to be placed in the Government of this Province, by His Maje&s;ties Mo&s;t Gracious Command; fir&s;t during the ab&s;ence of the late Governour, and then to be continued therein during the Vacancy of the Place, till Your Excellencys mo&s;t happy Arrival: So I do now mo&s;t &s;in|cerely own it to be the greate&s;t Honour that ever I do in this World ex|pect, that I have Re&s;igned it into &s;o Noble Hands as tho&s;e of Your Excel|lency; and &s;o much the more, becau&s;e the latter is of &s;o much greater advantage unto the Publick, than the former could be capable of.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> let the Station that I have Held, which hath much increa&s;ed the inten&s;ene&s;s of my Affection unto the good people of this Pro|vince, with whom I have long been Joyned; both in Pro&s;perity and Ad|ver&s;ity, and unto whom (I mean tho&s;e that &s;hall be gone before) I mu&s;t ere long nextly be gathered as unto my people: Let this excu&s;e my free|dom and boldne&s;s, that I do now by way of affectionate Reque&s;t, mo&s;t humbly and earne&s;tly Recommend them to Your Excellencys mo&s;t Gene|rous and Favourable Regards; whom by way of Authority, GOD and the KING have Committed unto Your Charge and Government, which I pray may be long and pro&s;perous; both to Your Self, and to us all.</P>
<P>Finally, <HI>My Lord,</HI> (which indeed &s;hould have been the fir&s;t thing &s;po|ken at this time) we do all mo&s;t humbly Thank Your Excellency for all the mo&s;t kind and obliging Expre&s;&s;ions of Favour to us in Your Lord&s;hips Speech made this Day.</P>
