<P N="2">2. We find no mention made in the Conce&s;&s;ions of &s;uch mode of Government as that a Governour is to be cho&s;en by the People, but mention of an A&s;&s;embly and ten Commi&s;&s;ioners. Neither can we find any warrantable foundation and legal Right either from the Kings Grant, or in the Conveyances to the particular Proprietors from E Billing, &amp;c to ju&s;tifie them in electing their Governor, nor yet for a popular Government without a &s;ingle Governor, or Com|mi&s;&s;ioners particularly a&s;&s;igned by legal Authority, NB.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>E.

<P N="4">4. That <HI>E.

<P N="5">5. That whereas <HI>S. Jenings</HI> &amp; the A&s;&s;embly in <HI>We&s;t-Jar&s;ey</HI> had po&s;itively acknowledged <HI>E.

<P><HI>REader,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ob&s;erve, That by the fore-going Award of tho&s;e eminent <HI>Quakers,</HI> the Government was in <HI>Billing,</HI> and not in the People of <HI>We&s;t-Jar&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>S. Jenings</HI> condemned by them <HI>for Betraying his Tru&s;t,</HI> in laying a&s;ide <HI>Billing's</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion, and taking the Government on him from the People; yet notwith&s;tanding all this, the &s;ame <HI>Sam.

<P>Hence is is that <HI>P. Fretwell</HI> and <HI>T. Gardner</HI> (two of the &s;aid <HI>Jenings</HI>'s Minions and Quondam Ju&s;tices) have run from County to County to &s;tir up People to Sedition, and to oppo&s;e the holding of any Courts by the Gover|nours Authority, and threa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on &s;uch as yeild Obedience thereunto.</P>

And hence the &s;aid <HI>Fretwell,</HI> the former Trea&s;urer, refu&s;es to give Account to Authority what he has done with all the Money he has received of the Province, and County Taxes: No, for doubtle&s;s he finds it more profitable to continue his former method, <HI>viz.</HI> to give account to his Fellows, who applaud him to the People, but pa&s;s his Accounts unexamined.</P>
<P>And hence it is that our Sheriff and his A&s;&s;i&s;tant, for doing their Office at <HI>Barlington,</HI> are by the &s;aid <HI>Gardiner</HI> arre&s;ted and &s;hed at a Court in <HI>Penn&s;il|vania,</HI> directly contrary to the Laws and Liberties of our Engli&s;h Nation, and a notorious Violation of our antient Priviledges.</P>
<P>And from hence &s;ome others have been encouraged to re&s;i&s;t the Govern|ment lately at <HI>Salem,</HI> where &s;ome <HI>Quakers</HI> al&s;o a&s;&s;umed the Militia by beat of Dru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp; Colours flying, and with Whips, Clubs and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">taves they forced off the Magi&s;trates from the Court hou&s;e, not &s;uffering them to keep Court (thereby &s;topping the currant of Ju&s;tice) till the Governour went with a Force of fifty Men in Arms, who by the Providence of God, and the &s;aid Governours di&s;creet management, broke thorow, and que<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d the Rabble, without Blood-&s;hed, even beyond the expectation of all concerned, the Captain of the&s;e Rioters having prepared his Gun with a Charge of thirty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eight &s;mall Bullets.</P>
<P>But all this &s;eemed little in the Eyes of <HI>S.

<P N="12">12. The pre&s;ent Governor brings over a <HI>Dedimus Forestatem</HI> under the broad Seal of <HI>England,</HI> takes the Oath, as pre&s;cribed by the Law. The Time, the Place, the Concour&s;e of Spectators and Auditors made this Act &s;o publick that it could not, that it cannot be deny'd by them.

So the late Governour, tho' he fail'd in both tho&s;e Preliminaries required by the Act, was &s;till notwith&s;tanding own'd by them as the legal Governor of the Province, and the pre&s;ent Governor that in reality fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls in neither, and by them is &s;uppo&s;ed &amp; charged but to fail in one, is deny'd to be &s;o for that preci&s;e Rea&s;on.
