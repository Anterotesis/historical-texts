<HEAD>I. Of Faith in the Holy Trinity.</HEAD>
<P>THere is but one living and true GOD, everlasting, with|out Body, Parts, or Passions; of infinite Power, Wis|dom, and Goodness; the Maker and Preserver of all Things both visible and invisible. And in Unity of this Godhead, there be three Persons, of one Substance, Power, and Eternity; the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>II. Of the Word, or the Son of God, which was made very man.</HEAD>
<P>THe SON, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from Everlasting of the Father, the very, and Eternal GOD, of one Substance with the Father, took Man's Nature in the Womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so that two whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the Godhead, and Manhood were joyned together in one Person, never to be divided, where|of is one Christ, very God, and very man, who truly suffered, was Crucified, dead and buried, to reconcile His Father to us, and to be a Sacrifice, not only for Original Guilt, but also for actual sins of men.</P>

<P>HOly Scripture containeth all things necessary to Salvation; so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be prov|ed thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an Article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or ne|cessary to Salvation.

<HEAD>VII. Of the Old Testament.</HEAD>
<P>THe Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New Testament, Everlasting Life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God &amp; man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign that the old fathers did look only for transito|ry promises. Altho' the Law given from God by <HI>Moses,</HI> as touch|ing Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the Civil precepts thereof ought of Necessity to be received in any Common-Wealth: yet notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever, is free from the Obedience of the Commandments which are called moral.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>VIII. Of the Three Creeds.</HEAD>
<P>THe three Creeds, Nice Creed, Athanasius Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles Creed, ought through|ly to be received and believed: for they may be proved by most certain Warrants of Holy Scripture.</P>

<PB N="4" REF="000448_0005_0FA5B0794392EAC0">
<HEAD>IX. Of original Birth or Sin.</HEAD>
<P>ORiginal Sin standeth not in the Following of <HI>Adam,</HI> (as the <HI>Pelagians</HI> do vainly talk) but it is the Fault, and Corrup|tion, of the Nature of every man that naturally is ingendred of the offspring of <HI>Adam,</HI> whereby man is very far gone from ori|ginal Righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the Flesh lusteth always contrary to the Spirit, and there|fore in every Person born into this world, it deserveth GOD's Wrath, and Damnation. And this infection of nature doth re|main, yea, in them that are regenerated, whereby the Lust of the Flesh, called in Greek, <HI>Phronema <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some the Affection, some the desire of the Flesh, is not subject to the Law of God. And altho' there is no Condemnation for them that believe and are Baptized, yet the Apostle doth confess, that Concupiscence and Lust hath of it self the nature of Sin.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>X. Of Free-Will.</HEAD>
<P>THe Condition of man, after the Fall of <HI>Adam</HI> is such, That he cannot turn &amp; prepare himself by his own natural strength &amp; good works, to Faith and Calling upon God: Wherefore we have no power to do Good Works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the Grace of God by Christ preventing us, that we may have a good Will, and working <HI>with</HI> us when we have that good Will.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>XI. Of the Justification of man.</HEAD>
<P>WE are accounted rightous before God, only for the Me|rit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own works, or deservings. Wherefore, that we are justified by Faith only, is a most wholsom Doctrine, and very full of comfort, as more largely is expressed in the <HI>Homily of Justification.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="article">
<PB N="5" REF="000448_0006_0FA5B079A0467B50">
<HEAD>XII. Of Good Works.</HEAD>
<P>ALbeit that Good works, which are the Fruits of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and follow after Justification, cannot put away our Sins&punc; and en|dure the Severity of God's Judgment, yet are they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and acceptable to God in Christ, and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith, insomuch that by them a lively Faith may be as evidently known, as a tree discerned by the Fruit.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>XIII. Of Works before Justification.</HEAD>
<P>WOrks done before the Grace of CHRIST, and the inspi|ration of His Spirit, are not pleasant to God, foras|much as they spring not of Faith in JESU Christ, neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the School Authors say) deserve Grace of Congruity: yea, rather for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the nature of Sin.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>XIV. Of Works of Supererogation.</HEAD>
<P>VOluntary Works besides, over and above God's Command|ments, which they call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without Arrogancy and Impiety. For by them men do declare, that they do not only render unto God as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake than of boun|den duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to you, <HI>say, we are unprofitable servants.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>XV. Of CHRIST alone without Sin.</HEAD>
<P>CHRIST in the truth of our nature, was made like unto us in all things, Sin only except, from which He was clearly void both in His flesh and in Spirit. He came to be a Lamb with|out spot, who by Sacrifice of Himself once made, should take away the sins of the World: and Sin (as St. <HI>John</HI> saith) was not in
<PB N="6" REF="000448_0007_0FA5B07A624BC900">
Him. But all we, the rest, altho' Baptized, and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things, and if we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves and the Truth is not in us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>XVI.</HI> Of Sin after Baptism.</HEAD>
<P>NOt every deadly Sin willingly committed after Baptism, is Sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable: Wherefore the Grant of Repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from Grace given, and fall into sin, and by the Grace of God, we may arise again, &amp; amend our Lives. And therefore they are to be condemned, which say they can no more sin as long as they live here, to deny the place of Forgiveness to such as truly repent.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>XVII.</HI> Of Predestination and Election.</HEAD>
<P>PRedestination to Life, is the everlasting purpose of GOD, whereby (before the Foundations of the world were laid) He hath constantly Decreed by His Counsel, secret to us, to deliver from Curse and Damnation, those whom He hath chosen in Christ out of Mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting Sal|vation, as vessels made to Honour. Wherefore they which be endued with so excellent a Benefit of God, be called according to God's purpose by His Spirit working in due season: they through Grace obey the Calling: they be justified freely: they be made sons of God by Adoption: they be made like the Image of His on|ly begotten Son JESUS CHRIST: they walk religiously in Good Works, and at length by GOD's Mercy they attain to everlast|ing Felicity.</P>
<P>As the godly Consideration of predestination and our Election in Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable Comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of the Flesh, and their earthly Members, and drawing up their mind to high and heaven|ly things, as well because it doth greatly establish &amp; confirm their Faith of eternal Salvation, to be enjoyed through Christ, as be|cause
<PB N="7" REF="000448_0008_0FA5B07B1028E2F8">
it doth frequently kindle their Love towards God: So, for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before their eyes the sentence of God's Predestination, is a most dangerous down-fall, whereby the devil doth thrust them either into desperation, or into wretchlesness of unclean Living, no less perilous than Desperation.</P>
<P>Furthermore, we must receive God's Promises in such wise as they be generally set forth to us in Holy Scripture: and in our Do|ings, that Will of God is to be followed, which we have expresly declared unto us in the word of God.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>XVIII.</HI> Of obtaining eternal Salvation only by the name of Christ.</HEAD>
<P>THey also are to be had accursed, that presume to say, That every man shall be saved by the Law or Sect which he pro|fesseth, so that he be diligent to frame his life according to that Law, and the light of nature: For holy Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> whereby men must be saved.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>XIX.</HI> Of the Church.</HEAD>
<P>THe visible Church of Christ is a Congregation of Faithful men, in the which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly Ministred, according to Christ's Ordinance in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same.</P>
<P>As the Church of <HI>Hierusalem, Alexandria,</HI> and <HI>Antioch</HI> have er|red; So also the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> hath erred, not only in their liv|ing and manner of Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="20" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>XX.</HI> Of the Authority of the Church.</HEAD>
<P>THe Church hath Power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and Authority in Controversies of Faith: And yet it is not law|ful for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore although the Church be a Witness and a Keeper of Holy Writt, yet as it ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides the same ought it not to enforce any thing to believed for necessity of Salvation.</P>

<PB N="8" REF="000448_0009_0FA5B07BE192E110">
<HEAD><HI>XXI.</HI> Of the Authority of General Councils.</HEAD>
<P>GEneral Councels may not be gathered together without the Commandment and Will of Princes: and when they be ga|thered together (forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, where|of all be not governed with the Spirit and Word of GOD) they may err, &amp; sometime <HI>have</HI> erred, even in things pertaining unto God. Wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to Salva|tion, have neither Strength nor Authority, unless it may be de|clared that they be taken out of holy Scripture.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>XXII.</HI> Of Purgatory.</HEAD>
<P>THe Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Wor|shipping and Adoration, as well of Images, as of Reliques; and also Invocation of Saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, &amp; grounded upon no Warranty of Scripture, but rather Repugnant to the Word of God.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="23" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>XXIII</HI> Of Ministring in the Congregation&punc;</HEAD>
<P>IT is not lawful for any man to take upon him the Office of pub|lick Preaching, or Ministring the Sacraments in the Congrega|tion, before he be lawfully Called and sent to execute the same: and <HI>those</HI> we ought to judge lawfully called &amp; sent, which be cho|sen &amp; called to this work by men who have publick Authority giv|en unto them in the Congregation, to call and send Ministers into the Lords Vineyard.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="24" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>XXIV.</HI> Of Speaking in the Congregation in such a Tongue as the People understandeth.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God &amp; the Cus|tom of the primitive Church, to have publick prayer in the Church, or to Minister the Sacraments in a Tongue not under|stood by the People.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="25" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>XXV. Of the Sacrament,</HEAD>
<P>SAcraments ordained of Christ, be not only Badges or tokens of Christian mens Profession; but rather they be certain sure Witnesses, and effectual Signs of Grace, and God's Good Will to|wards us, by the which He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only <HI>quicken,</HI> but also <HI>strengthen</HI> and <HI>confirm</HI> our <HI>Faith</HI> in Him.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000448_0010_0FA5B07C87F0B318">There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, <HI>Baptism,</HI> and <HI>the Supper of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, <HI>Confir|mation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony,</HI> and <HI>Extreme Vnction,</HI> are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown, partly of the corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed by the Scriptures: but yet have not like na|ture of Sacraments, with <HI>Baptism</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> for that they have not any visible Sign or Ceremony ordained of God.</P>
<P>The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be Carried about, but that we should duly use them. And in such only as worthily receive the same, they have a wholsom effect or operation: but they that receive them unworthily, pur|chase to themselves Damnation, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> saith,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="26" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>XXVI</HI> Of the unworthiness of the Ministers which hinder not the Effects of the Sacraments,</HEAD>
<P>ALthough in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and sometime the evil have chief Authority in the Ministration of the Word and Sacraments; yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own name, but in <HI>Christ</HI>'s, and do minis|ter by His Commission and Authority, we may use their Ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in the receiving of the Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ's Ordinance taken a|way by their wickedness, nor the grace of God's Gifts diminished from such, as by <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>rightly</HI> do Receive the Sacraments mi|nistred unto them, which be effectual, because of Christ's Institu|tion &amp; Promise, although they be ministred by evil men.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the Discipline of the Church, that enquiry be made of evil ministers, and that they be accused by those that have knowledge of their Offences: and finally be|ing found guilty, by just Judgment be deposed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="27" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>XXVII.</HI> Of Baptism.</HEAD>
<P>BAptism is not only a Sign of Profession, and mark of Difference whereby Christian men are discerned from others that be not Christned: but it is also a sign of Regeneration or new Birth, whereby, as by an instrument, they that receive Baptism rightly,
<PB N="10" REF="000448_0011_0FA5B07D46475878">
are grafted into the Church: the promises of the Forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the Sons of God, by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed: Faith is confirmed, and Grace in|creased by virtue of Prayer unto God The Baptism of young Children is in any wise to be retained in the Church, as most a|greeable with the Institution of Christ.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="28" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>XXVIII.</HI> Of the Lords Supper.</HEAD>
<P>THe Supper of the Lord, is not only a sign of the Love that Christians ought to have among themselves one to ano|ther: but rather it is a Sacrament of our Redemption by Christ's Death: insomuch that to such as rightly, worthily, and with Faith receive the same, the Bread which we break, is a par|taking of the Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ.</P>
<P>Transubstantiation (or the Change of the Substance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Ho|ly Writ: but it is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the Nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occa|sion to many Superstitions.</P>
<P>The Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper on|ly after an <HI>heavenly</HI> &amp; <HI>spiritual</HI> manner. And the mean whereby the Body of Christ is received and eaten in the Lords Supper is <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P>The Sacrament of the Lords Supper, was not by Christ's Or|dinance Reserved, Carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="29" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>XXIX.</HI> Of the wicked, which eat not the Body of Christ in the use of the Lords Supper.</HEAD>
<P>THe wicked and such as be void of a lively Faith, altho' they do carnally &amp; visibly press with their Teeth (as St. <HI>Augustine</HI> saith) the Sacrament of the Body &amp; Blood of Christ: yet in no wise are they partakers of Christ; but rather to their Condem|nation do eat &amp; drink the <HI>sign</HI> or <HI>Sacrament</HI> of so great a thing.</P>

<HEAD>XXXVI. Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers.</HEAD>
<P>THe Book of Consecration of Archbishops &amp; Bishops, and Or|dering of Priests &amp; Deacons, lately set forth in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the 6. and confirmed at the same time by the Authority of Parliament, doth contain all things necessary to such Consecration &amp; Ordering: neither hath it any thing that of it self is supersti|tious &amp; and ungodly. And therefore whosoever are Consecrated, or Ordered according to the Rites of that Book, since the 2<HI>nd</HI> year of the aforenamed K. <HI>Edward,</HI> unto this time, or hereafter <HI>shall</HI> be
<PB N="13" REF="000448_0014_0FA5B0828A5AECB8">
Consecrated or Ordered according to the same Rites, we decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully Consecrated &amp; Ordered.</P>

<HEAD>XXXVII. Of the Civil Magistrates.</HEAD>
<P>THe Queens Majesty hath the chief Power in this Realm of <HI>England,</HI> and other Her Dominions, unto whom the chief Government of all Estates of this Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in all Causes doth apper|tain, and is not, nor ought to be subject to any foreign Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>Where we attribute to the Queens Majesty the Chief Govern|ment, by which Titles we understand the minds of some slander|ous folks to be offended: we give not to our Princes the ministring either of God's Word, or of the Sacraments, the which thing the Injunctions also lately set forth by <HI>Elizabeth</HI> our Queen, do most plainly testify: but that only Prerogative which we see to have been given always to all godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God Himself, <HI>that is,</HI> that they should Rule all Estates &amp; Degrees com|mitted to their Charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and restrain with the Civil Sword the stubborn and evil Doers.</P>
<P>The Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> hath no Jurisdiction in this Realm of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with death, for hainous and grievous Offences.</P>
<P>It is lawful for Christian men, at the Commandment of the Magistrate, to wear Weapons, and serve in the Wars.</P>

<HEAD>XXXVIII. Of Christian mens Goods which are not Common.</HEAD>
<P>THe Riches &amp; Goods of Christians are not Common, as touch|ing the Right, Title &amp; Possession of the same, as certain <HI>A|nabaptists</HI> do falsly boast. Notwithstanding, every man ought of such things as he possesseth, liberally to give Alms to the poor, according to his Ability.</P>

<HEAD>XXXIX. Of A Christian man's Oath.</HEAD>
<P>AS we confess that vain &amp; rash Swearing is forbidden Christian men by our Lord Jesus Christ, &amp; <HI>James</HI> His Apostle; so we judge that Christian Religion doth not prohibit, but that a man
<PB N="14" REF="000448_0015_0FA5B08350EACB98">
may Swear when the Magistrate requireth, in a Cause of Faith and Charity, so it be done according to the Prophet's Teaching, in <HI>Justice, Judgment, and Truth.</HI></P>
