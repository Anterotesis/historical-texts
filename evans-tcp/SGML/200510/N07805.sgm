<P>IT would now, be an unfa&s;hionable doctrine, whatever the ancient opini|on might be, to affirm that the con&s;tituent can bind his repre&s;entative by in&s;tructions; but tho' the obligatory force of the&s;e in&s;tructions is not in&s;i&s;ted upon, yet their per&s;ua&s;ive influence, in mo&s;t c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es, may be; for a repre&s;entative, who &s;hould act again&s;t the explicit recommendation of his con&s;tituents, would mo&s;t de&s;ervedly forfeit their regard, and all preten&s;ion to their future confidence.</P>

<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IN the con&s;titution of <HI>England,</HI> the three principal forms of government, monarchy, ari&s;tocracy, and democracy, are blended together in certain proportions; but each of the&s;e orders, in the exerci&s;e of the legi&s;lative authority, hath its peculiar department, from which the others are excluded. In this divi&s;ion, the <HI>granting of &s;upplies.</HI> or <HI>laying taxes,</HI> is deemed to be the province of the hou&s;e of commons, as the repre&s;entative of the people......All &s;upplies are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;low from their gift; and the other orders are permitted only to a&s;&s;ent, or reject generally, not to propo&s;e any modification, amendment, or par|tia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> alteration of it.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation being con&s;idered, it will undeniably appear, that in framing the late <HI>Stamp Act,</HI> the commons acted in the character o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> repre&s;entative of the colonies. They a&s;&s;umed it as the principle of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mea&s;ure, and the <HI>propriety</HI> of it mu&s;t therefore &s;tand, or fall, as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> principle is true, or fal&s;e: For the preamble &s;ets forth, that the com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mons of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> had re&s;olved to <HI>give and grant</HI> the &s;everal rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and duties impo&s;ed by the act; but what right had the commons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to be thus munificent at the expence of the commons <HI>America?.</HI>.......To give property not belonging to the giver, and wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> out the con&s;ent of the owner, is &s;uch evident and flagrant inju&s;tice, <HI>ordinary ca&s;es,</HI> that few are hardy enough to avow it; and therefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> when it really happens, the fact is di&s;gui&s;ed and varni&s;hed over by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t plau&s;ible pretences the ingenuity of the giver can &s;ugge&s;t......<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it is alledged that there is a <HI>virtual,</HI> or <HI>implied repre&s;entation</HI> of the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nies &s;pringing out of the con&s;titution of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> government: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed on all hands, that, as the repre&s;entation is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> actual, it is virtual, or it doth not exi&s;t at all; for no third kind of pre&s;entation can be imagined. The colonies claim the privilege, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is common to all <HI>Briti&s;h &s;ubjects,</HI> of being taxed <HI>only</HI> with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;ent given by their repre&s;entatives, and all the advocates for <HI>Stamp Act</HI> admit this claim. Whether, therefore, upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="6" REF="009958_0005_0F7B3ED7455B75C0">
matter, the impo&s;ition of the <HI>Stamp Duties</HI> is a <HI>proper</HI> exerci&s;e of con|&s;titutional authority, or not, depends upon the &s;ingle que&s;tion, Whe|ther the commons of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are <HI>virtually</HI> the repre&s;entatives of the commons of <HI>America,</HI> or not.</P>
<P>The advocates for the Stamp Act admit, in expre&s;s terms, that
<Q>the colonies do not choo&s;e members of parliament,</Q>
<Q>but they a&s;&s;ert that the colonies are <HI>virtually</HI> repre&s;ented in the &s;ame manner with the non-electors re&s;ident in <HI>Great Britain,</HI></Q></P>
<P>How have they proved this po&s;ition? Where have they defined, or preci&s;ely explained what they mean by the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>virtual repre&s;en|tation?</HI> As it is the very hinge upon which the rectitude of the taxation turns, &s;omething more &s;atisfactory than mere a&s;&s;ertion, more &s;olid than a form of expre&s;&s;ion, is nece&s;&s;ary: for how can it be &s;eriou&s;ly expected, that men, who think them&s;elves injuriou&s;ly affected in their properties and privileges, will be convinced and reconciled by a fanciful phra&s;e, the meaning of which can't be preci&s;ely a&s;certained by tho&s;e who u&s;e it, or properly applied to the purpo&s;e for which it hath been advanced?</P>
<P>They argue, that
<Q>the right of election being annexed to certain &s;pecies of property, to franchi&s;es, and inhabitancy in &s;ome particu|lar places, a very &s;mall part of the land, the property, and the peo|ple of <HI>England</HI> are comprehended in tho&s;e de&s;criptions. All landed property, not freehold, and all monied property, are <HI>excluded.</HI> The merchants of <HI>London,</HI> the proprietors of the public funds, the inha|bitants of <HI>Leeds, Halifax, Birmingham,</HI> and <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> and that great corporation of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> company, <HI>none of them</HI> choo&s;e their repre&s;entatives, and yet are they all repre&s;ented in parliament, and the colonies being <HI>exactly</HI> in <HI>their</HI> &s;ituation, are repre&s;ented in the <HI>&s;ame manner.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, this argument, which is all that their invention hath been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble to &s;upply, is totally defective; for, it con&s;i&s;ts of facts not true, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> conclu&s;ions inadmi&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It is &s;o far from being true, that all the per&s;ons enumerated under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e character of <HI>non-electors,</HI> are in that predicament, that it is indu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tably certain there is <HI>no</HI> &s;pecies of property, landed, or monied, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>very many</HI> of the <HI>Briti&s;h electors.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall undertake to di&s;prove the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;imilarity of &s;ituation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence the &s;ame kind of repre&s;entation is deduced, of the inhabitants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the colonies, and of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> non-electors; and, if I &s;ucceed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> notion of a <HI>virtual repre&s;entation</HI> of the colonies mu&s;t fail, which, truth, is a mere cob web, &s;pread to catch the unwary, and intangle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> weak. I wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d be under&s;tood: I am upon a que&s;tion of <HI>propriety,</HI>

not of power; and, though &s;ome may be inclined to think it is to little purpo&s;e to di&s;cu&s;s the one, when the other is irre&s;i&s;tible, yet are they different con&s;iderations; and, at the &s;ame time that I inva|lidate the claim upon which it is founded, I may very con&s;i&s;tently re|commend a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the law, whil&s;t it endures. I &s;hall &s;ay no|thing of the u&s;e I intend by the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; for if it &s;hould not be perceived by the &s;equel, there is no u&s;e in it, and, if it &s;hould appear then, it need not be premi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Le&s;&s;ees for years, copyholders, proprietors of the public fund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; in|habitants of <HI>Birmingham, Leeds, Halifax,</HI> and <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> merchants of the city of <HI>London,</HI> or members of the corporation of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> company, are, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> under no per&s;onal incapacity to be electors; for they may acquire the right of election, and there are <HI>actually</HI> not only a con&s;iderable number of electors in each of the cla&s;&s;es of le&s;&s;ees for years, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but in many of them, if not all, even members of par|liament. The intere&s;ts therefore of the non-electors, the electors, and the repre&s;entatives, are individually the &s;ame; to &s;ay nothing of the connection among neighbours, friends, and relations. The &s;ecurity of the non-electors again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, is, that their oppre&s;&s;ion will fall al&s;o upon the electors and the repre&s;entatives. The one can't be in|jured, and the other indemnified.</P>
<P>Further, if the non-electors &s;hould not be taxed by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> par|liament, they would not be taxed <HI>at all</HI>; and it would be iniquitous as well as a &s;oleci&s;m, in the political &s;y&s;tem, that they &s;hould partake of all the benefits re&s;ulting from the impo&s;ition, and application of taxes, and derive an immunity from the circum&s;tance of not being qualified to vote. Under this con&s;titution then, a double or virtual repre&s;entation may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed. The electors, who are in&s;eparably connected in their intere&s;ts with the non-electors, may be ju&s;tly deemed to be the repre&s;entatives of the non-electors, at the &s;ame time they exerci&s;e their per&s;onal privilege in the right of election; and the members cho&s;en, therefore, the repre&s;entatives of both. This is the only rational explanation of the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>virtual repre&s;entation.</HI> None has been advanced by the a&s;&s;ertors of it, and their meaning can only be inferred from the in&s;tances, by which they endeavour to elu|cidate it, and no other meaning can be &s;tated, to which the in&s;tances apply.</P>
<P>It is an e&s;&s;ential principle of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;titution, that the &s;ubject &s;hall not be taxed without his con&s;ent, which hath not been introdu|ced by any particular law, but nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ults from the nature of that mixed government; for, without it, the order of democracy could not exi&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="009958_0007_0F7B3ED8F2C8D2F0"><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t. Peerage.</NOTE> Parliaments were not formerly &s;o regular in point of form as they now are. Even the number or knights for each &s;hire were not a&s;cer|tained. The fir&s;t writs now ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ant for their choice, are 22d <HI>Edward</HI> I. by which, two, as at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s day, were directed to be cho&s;en for each county; but the king not being &s;atisfied with that number, other writs were i&s;&s;ued for choo&s;ing two more. This di&s;cretionary power being thought inconvenient, was afterwards re&s;trained by the &s;tatutes of <HI>Richard</HI> II, <HI>Henry</HI> IV, and &s;ub&s;equent acts.</P>
<P>In earlier times there was more &s;implicity in the rules of govern|ment, and men were more &s;olicitous about the e&s;&s;entials, than the forms of it. When the con&s;ent of tho&s;e who were to perform, or pay any thing extrafeudal, was fairly applied for and obtained, the manner was little regarded; but, as the people had rea&s;on to be jealous of de|&s;igns to impo&s;e contributions upon them without their con&s;ent, it was thought expedient to have formalities regulated, and fixed, to prevent this injury to their rights, not to de&s;troy a principle, without which, they could not be &s;aid to have any rights at all.</P>
<P>Before the introduction of tho&s;e formalities, which were framed with a view to re&s;train the excu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ions of power, and to &s;ecure the pri|vileges of the &s;ubject, as the mode of proceeding was more &s;imple, &s;o perhaps this foundation of con&s;ent was more vi&s;ible than it is at pre|&s;ent, wherefore it may be of u&s;e to adduce &s;ome in&s;tances, which di|rectly point out this nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential principle of <HI>Briti&s;h liberty.</HI></P>
<P>The lords and commons have &s;eparately given aids and &s;ub&s;idies to the crown. In 13th <HI>Edward</HI> III, the lords granted the tenth of all the corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> growing upon their deme&s;nes, the commons then granting nothing, nor concerning them&s;elves with what the lords thought fit to grant out of their own e&s;tates. At other times, the knights of &s;hires, &s;eparating from the re&s;t of the commons, and join|ing with the lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, have granted a &s;ub&s;idy, and the repre&s;entatives of cities and boroughs have likewi&s;e granted &s;ub&s;idies to the crown &s;epa|rately, as appears by a writ in 24th <HI>Edward</HI> I, which runs in the&s;e words, <HI>Rex,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>cum comites, barones, milites nobis,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>fecerunt unde|cimam de omnibus bonis &s;uis mobilibus, et cives et burgen&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>&s;ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">imam de omnibus bonis &s;uis mobilibus,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>nobis curialiter conce&s;&s;erint,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>The earls, barons, and knights, having given unto us in parliament, the e|leventh part, and the citizens and burge&s;&s;es the &s;eventh part of their goods and chattels, &amp;c.</HI> When an affair happened, which affected only &s;ome individuals, and called for an aid to the crown, it was common for tho&s;e individuals <HI>alone</HI> to be &s;ummoned; to which purpo&s;e &s;everal writs are

<P>But I don't re&s;t the matter upon this, or any other circum&s;tance, however con&s;iderable, to prove the impropriety of a taxation by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament.

......Now, under favour, I conceive there is more confidence, than &s;olidity in this a&s;&s;ertion; and it may be &s;atis|factorily and ea&s;ily proved, that the &s;ubordination and dependence of the colonies may be pre&s;erved, and the <HI>&s;upreme authority</HI> of the mother country be firmly &s;upported, and yet the principle of repre&s;entation, and the right of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> hou&s;e of commons flowing from <HI>it,</HI> to <HI>give and grant</HI> the property of the commons of <HI>America,</HI> be denied.</P>
<P>The colonies are dependent upon <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the &s;upreme authority ve&s;ted in the king, lords, and commons, may ju&s;tly be exer|ci&s;ed to &s;ecure, or pre&s;erve their dependence, whenever nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e.

But, though the right of the &s;uperior to u&s;e the proper means for pre&s;erving the &s;ubordination of his inferior is admitted, yet it does not nece&s;&s;arily follow, that he has a right to &s;eize the property of his inferior when he plea&s;es, or to command him in every thing; &s;ince, in the degrees of it, there may very well exi&s;t a <HI>dependence</HI> and <HI>inferiority,</HI> without ab&s;olute <HI>va&s;&s;alage</HI> and <HI>&s;lavery.</HI> In what the &s;uperior may <HI>rightfully</HI> controul, or compel, and in what the inferior ought to be at liberty to act without controul or compul&s;ion, depends upon the nature of the dependence, and the degree of the &s;ubordination; and, the&s;e being a&s;certained, the mea&s;ure of obedience, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the extent of the authority and &s;uperintendence will be &s;ettled. When powers, compatible with the relation between the &s;uperior and inferior, have, by expre&s;s compact, been granted to, and accepted by,
<PB N="15" REF="009958_0014_0F7B3EDDF6D60660">
the latter, and have been, after that compact, repeatedly recognized by the former&mdash; When they may be exerci&s;ed effectually upon every occa&s;ion without any injury to that relation, the authority of the &s;u|perior can't properly interpo&s;e; for, by the powers ve&s;ted in the infe|rior, is the &s;uperior limited.</P>

<P>That the contribution ari&s;ing from the <HI>&s;tamp duties</HI> is di&s;proportion|ed to <HI>their</HI> circum&s;tances from whom it is exacted, is manife&s;t; for they will produce in each colony, a greater or le&s;s &s;um, not in propor|tion to its wealth, but to the multiplicity of juridical forms, the quan|tity of vacant land, the frequency of transferring landed property, the extent of paper negociations, the &s;carcity of money, and the number of debtors.

What a&s;toni&s;hment would the promoters of that glorious mea&s;ure, tho&s;e patrons and friends of liberty, did they now tread the &s;tage of

<P>It was declared al&s;o by the <HI>bill of rights,</HI> that the elections of <HI>mem|bers of parliament</HI> ought to be free, and the common law laid down the &s;ame rule before, which is as applicable to the election of the re|pre&s;entatives of the colonies, as of the commons of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> But with the help of the examiner's logic, it might be proved from the <HI>letter</HI> of the <HI>bill of rights,</HI> that the elections <HI>only</HI> of <HI>members of par|liament</HI> ought to be free; for the freedom expre&s;&s;ed in the bill of rights, is as much attached to elections of members of parliament, as the authority to grant money is to <HI>the</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>parliament,</HI> and if the declaration in the one ca&s;e implies a negative, there is the like impli|cation in the other. If, moreover, the common law, the great char|ter, and the bill of rights, do really, as the examiner a&s;&s;erts, with one voice declare, that the inhabitants of the colonies ought to be taxed <HI>only</HI> by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament, it is not con&s;i&s;tent with that cha|racter of vigilance, and jealou&s;y of their power, commonly a&s;cribed to the <HI>Briti&s;h parliament,</HI> that, from their fir&s;t regular &s;ettlement to the reign of <HI>George</HI> III, the <HI>American</HI> a&s;&s;emblies &s;hould not only have been &s;uffered, without any animadver&s;ion, without one re&s;olve, or e|ven a &s;ingle motion to re&s;train them, to encroach upon the juri&s;diction and authority of the <HI>Briti&s;h parliament</HI>; but that the parliament &s;hould never before the late <HI>&s;tamp-act,</HI> in one in&s;tance, have impo&s;ed an inter|nal tax upon the colonies for <HI>the &s;ingle purpo&s;e of revenue,</HI> and that, even when acts of a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed in con&s;equence of mini&s;terial inforced by royal requi&s;itions have been laid before them, they &s;hould be &s;o far from objecting to their validity, as actually to recognize the authority of the provincial legi&s;latures, and upon that foundation &s;uper&s;truct their own re&s;olves and acts.</P>

<P>It appears to me, that there is a clear and nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction be|tween an act impo&s;ing a tax for <HI>the &s;ingle purpo&s;e of revenue,</HI> and tho&s;e acts which have been made for the regulation of trade, and have pro|duced &s;ome revenue <HI>in con&s;equence of their effect</HI> and operation as <HI>regu|lations of trade.</HI></P>

<P>The &s;ubordination of the colonies, and the authority of the parlia|ment to pre&s;erve it, have been fully acknowledged.

be neglected, there would &s;oon be an end to that commerce, whence her greate&s;t wealth is derived, and upon which her maritime power is principally founded. From the&s;e con&s;iderations, the right of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h parliament</HI> to regulate the trade of the colonies, may be ju&s;tly de|duced; a denial of it would contradict the admi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubordina|tion, and of the authority to pre&s;erve it, re&s;ulting from the nature of the relation between the mother country and her colonies. It is a common, and frequently the mo&s;t proper method to regulate trade by duties on imports and exports. The authority of the mother country to regulate the trade of the colonies, being unque&s;tionable, what re|gulations are the mo&s;t proper, are to be of cour&s;e &s;ubmitted to the de|termination of the parliament; and, if an <HI>incidental revenue,</HI> &s;hould be produced by &s;uch regulations; the&s;e are not therefore unwarrant|able.</P>
<P>A right to impo&s;e an internal tax on the colonies, without their con&s;ent <HI>for the &s;ingle purpo&s;e of revenue,</HI> is denied, a right to regulate their trade without their con&s;ent is admitted.

<P>It would be u&s;ele&s;s, as well as tedious, to point out every mi&s;re|pre&s;entation in this application, &s;ince that will be effectually done, by briefly &s;hewing the effect of the 5th Geo. II, and &s;ugge&s;ting the occa|&s;ion of making that &s;tatute.</P>
<P>Lands, negroes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the plantations, are made a&s;&s;ets for the &s;atisfaction of all debts owing to his maje&s;ty, or <HI>any of his &s;ubjects,</HI> in like manner as real e&s;tates are, by the law of <HI>England</HI> liable to the &s;atisfaction of debts due by &s;pecialty.</P>
<P>If the creditor re&s;ides in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the affidavits of his wit|ne&s;&s;es taken there, are to be allowed as evidence, and to have the &s;ame force their te&s;timony would have, if given, <HI>viv&acirc; voce,</HI> in open court.</P>
<P>The evidence mentioned in the &s;tatute, prevailed in mo&s;t, if not all the colonies, before the &s;tatute, and lands were al&s;o liable to the &s;atis|faction of all debts in mo&s;t in&s;tances, by the method practi&s;ed al&s;o in the court of chancery in <HI>England,</HI> of mar&s;halling a&s;&s;ets.

<P>Independent of the &s;tatute, when the creditor obtains a judgment again&s;t his debtor, <HI>all</HI> his lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> over which he has a <HI>di&s;po&s;ing</HI> power, are liable, and, &s;ince the &s;tatute, only <HI>&s;uch</HI> lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are a&s;&s;ets, as the debtor had a power to di&s;po&s;e of. It appears then, that all the effects of the &s;tatute on this head, is to &s;ubject real e&s;tates to the payment of debts <HI>after</HI> the death of the debtor, (for the mo&s;t part the ca&s;e before the &s;tatute) which might have been made &s;ubject <HI>before</HI> his death.</P>
<P>In many of the colonies, the provincial creditors of decea&s;ed debtors, were preferred to the <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> in the &s;ame degree, by acts of a&s;&s;embly
<PB N="37" REF="009958_0036_0F7B3EF376E9C510">
which carried the appearance of partiality; tho' in fact, the effect of the laws of <HI>England</HI> gave ri&s;e to them; for, upon bankruptcies in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the &s;teps required by the &s;tatutes to entitle creditors to a &s;atisfaction, effectually exclude colony creditors in mo&s;t ca&s;es, and their di&s;tance, when their debtors die in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> where colony creditors have not &s;tanding agents as the merchants have in the planta|tions, and there happens a deficiency of a&s;&s;ets, &s;huts them out like|wi&s;e from all chance of &s;atisfaction in the u&s;ual &s;cramble among cre|ditors for the debtor's e&s;tate on &s;uch events.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the colonies they changed, by acts of a&s;&s;embly, certain &s;pecies of per&s;onal property, <HI>e. g.</HI> negroes, into the nature of real e&s;tates, by making them de&s;cendible; and, by this alteration of the common law, and confu&s;ion of the former di&s;tinction of property, very con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed the per&s;onal fund liable to <HI>all</HI> debts.</P>
<P>As the&s;e circum&s;tances were repre&s;ented and believed to be great di&s;couragements to the trade of the mother country, after repeated re|qui&s;itions to provide a remedy in the colonies, in which the grievance was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt, had been di&s;regarded, the &s;tatute was finally made.</P>
<P>This was, without doubt, a &s;ubject upon which the &s;uperintendence of the mother-country might be ju&s;tly exerci&s;ed; it being relative to her trade and navigation, upon which her wealth and her power de|pend, and the pre&s;ervation of her &s;uperiority, and the &s;ubordination of the colonies, are &s;ecured, and therefore is comprehended in the di&s;|tinction.</P>

<P>"Had the colonies," &s;ays the examiner,
<Q>agreed to the impo&s;i|tion of the &s;tamp-duties, a precedent would have been e&s;tabli&s;hed for their being con&s;ulted, before any impo&s;ition upon them by par|liament would hereafter take place.</Q>
He intimates that they were advi&s;ed by &s;ome of their agents to take this cour&s;e: If &s;uch advice hath been given, it was weak or in&s;idious, and the agents, who re|commended the mea&s;ure, ought to be removed for their incapacity or their treachery.</P>
<P>How would the precedent have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, or, if it had, what would have been the advantage? This conduct would have admitted, that the colonies might be taxed at any time, and in any manner, without their con&s;ent; and con&s;equently, would at once have been an effectual &s;urrender of all their privileges as <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>If precedents were to be regarded, when a tax in <HI>America,</HI> for the <HI>&s;ingle purpo&s;e of revenue</HI> is required, they are not wanting. Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, the cour&s;e hath always, and uniformly been, 'till the im|po&s;ition of the &s;tamp duties, to tran&s;mit requi&s;itions to the colonies; and, if the in&s;tance cited by the examiner, is, in any degree pertinent, he has &s;hewn in his appendix, that the method of requi&s;ition was <HI>in that</HI> pur&s;ued; for, the lords of trade, in their report, expre&s;ly mention the refu&s;al of the colonies to comply with the requi&s;itions tran&s;mitted to them, to remove the grievance complained of.</P>
<P>The clau&s;e in the mutiny act during the late war is al&s;o relied upon, but with how much propriety, few words will evince.</P>
<P>The acts of a&s;&s;embly of each colony, could have no obligatory force beyond the limits of each; but the &s;ervice of the colony troops, was not confined within the &s;ame colony in which they were rai&s;ed; it is therefore evident that the provincial legi&s;latures, had not an au|thority adequate to the great object of the military operations in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> which was not merely the defence of the plantations, by mea|&s;ures executed within their boundaries, but the enemy was attacked
<PB N="39" REF="009958_0038_0F7B3EF496EE6838">
in his own country, and for this purpo&s;e the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>American</HI> troops acted conjunctly. On this occa&s;ion it was not only conve|nient, that the troops employed in the &s;ame &s;ervice, &s;hould be &s;ubject to the &s;ame di&s;cipline, but it was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary that this di&s;cipline &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed by <HI>act of parliament,</HI> the authority of the <HI>provincial legi&s;latures</HI> being deemed incompetent. And it is to be remarked, moreover, that the provincial troops were rai&s;ed and paid by the colonies, and that it was in the power of their a&s;&s;emblies, a power exerci&s;ed by &s;ome of them, to di&s;band or reduce them when they plea&s;ed, and therefore their &s;upporting and keeping them up, was an effectual con&s;ent to the act of parliament; but as hath been &s;hewn, an internal tax may be as compleatly and adequately laid in every co|lony, by the authority of the <HI>re&s;pective a&s;&s;emblies,</HI> as by the <HI>Briti&s;h parliament,</HI> and therefore there is not the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity for the inter|po&s;ition of the mother-country in this, as in the other in&s;tance, and the colonies with reference to the &s;tamp-act, are not called upon to do any act expre&s;&s;ive of their a&s;&s;ent to it, nor is it in their power to hinder its taking effect in the fulle&s;t exent.</P>
<P>The act for <HI>the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a po&s;t-office in the colonies</HI> (9 <HI>Anne,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 10,) comes the neare&s;t to the &s;ubject of any regulation that hath been mentioned; but yet it is materially di&s;tingui&s;hable from the &s;tamp-act. For the &s;ame rea&s;on that an act of parliament was nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;ecure the di&s;cipline of the provincial troops, acting in con|junction with the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> forces during the late war, the authority of parliament might be proper for the general e&s;tabli&s;hment of a regular po&s;t-office, for as the laws of each colony are in their operation con|fined within the limits of each, prohibitory and compul&s;ive clau&s;es to inforce a general ob&s;ervance, without which the e&s;tabli&s;hment would fail, might be eluded. If a man &s;hould maliciou&s;ly give a wound in one colony, and the wounded per&s;on die in another, the offender could not be convicted of murder, becau&s;e the whole fact con&s;tituting that crime, would not be cognizable in the colony where the wound was given, or the death happened; and the &s;ame principle is appli|cable to every other inferior offence, and intimates in what manner prohibitory clau&s;es might be evaded. This matter therefore of the po&s;t-office, may be referred to the general &s;uperintending authority of the mother country, the power of the provincial legi&s;latures being too &s;tinted to reach it. In this view, and upon the con&s;ideration of the general convenience and accommodation ari&s;ing from the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, the people of <HI>America,</HI> have not complained of it, but if this in&s;tance were more pertinent than it is, it would only prove what hath

been too often proved before.......when men do not &s;u&s;pect any de&s;igns to invade their rights, and &s;ubdolous &s;teps taken to that end, are pro|ductive of immediate convenience without pointing out their de&s;truc|tive tendency, they are frequently involved in ruin before they are a|ware of danger, or that the conduct flowing from the negligence of innocent intentions, may afford a handle to men of different di&s;po|&s;itions, for the commi&s;&s;ion of oppre&s;&s;ion......of the truth of the&s;e ob|&s;ervations the hi&s;tories of all people who have once been ble&s;&s;ed with freedom, and have lo&s;t it, exhibit abundant examples.</P>
<P>When in&s;tances are urged as an authoritative rea&s;on for adopting a new mea&s;ure, they are proved to be more important from this u&s;e of them, and ought therefore to be reviewed with accuracy, and can|va&s;&s;ed with &s;trictne&s;s. What is propo&s;ed ought to be incorporated with what hath been done, and the re&s;ult of both &s;tated and con&s;idered as a &s;ub&s;tantive original que&s;tion, and if the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed is incom|patible with the con&s;titutional rights of the &s;ubject, it is &s;o far from being a rational argument, that con&s;i&s;tency requires an adoption of the propo&s;ed mea&s;ure, that, on the contrary, it &s;ugge&s;ts the &s;tronge&s;t motive for aboli&s;hing the precedent; when therefore an in&s;tance of <HI>deviation</HI> from the con&s;titution is pre&s;&s;ed as a rea&s;on for the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h|ment</HI> of a mea&s;ure &s;triking at the very root of all liberty; though the argument is inconclu&s;ive, it ought to be u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Wherefore if a &s;ufficient an&s;wer were not given to the argument drawn from precedents, by &s;hewing that none of the in&s;tances adduc|ed are applicable, I &s;hould have very little difficulty in denying the ju&s;tice of the principle, on which it is founded. What hath been done, if wrongful, confers no right to repeat it. To ju&s;tify oppre&s;|&s;ion and outrage, by in&s;tances of their commi&s;&s;ion, is a kind of ar|gument which never can produce conviction, though it may <HI>their</HI> ac|quie&s;cence, whom the terror of greater evils may re&s;train from re&s;i&s;t|ing, and thus the de&s;poti&s;m of the ea&s;t may be &s;upported, and the natural rights of mankind be trampled under feet. The que&s;tion of right, therefore, doth not depend upon precedents, but on the prin|ciples of the con&s;titution, and hath been put upon its proper point al|ready di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, whether the colonies are repre&s;ented or not, in par|liament.</P>
<P>As the name of <HI>Hambden</HI> occurred to the examiner in his de&s;ign of ca&s;ting an oblique reflection upon the colonies, it is &s;urpri&s;ing he did not recollect, that very numerous precedents have been applied in the defence of an arbitrary and oppre&s;&s;ive proceeding, de&s;tructive of the e&s;&s;ential principle of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> liberty. But though meer acts of power
<PB N="41" REF="009958_0040_0F7B3EF769D20E00">
prove no right, yet the real opinion entertained of it, may be infer|red from forbearance; for mankind are generally &s;o fond of power, that they are oftener tempted to exerci&s;e it beyond the limits of ju&s;tice, than induced to &s;et bounds to it from the pure con&s;ideration of the rectitude of forbearance. Wherefore if I had denied the principle of this kind of rea&s;oning, without &s;hewing the defects of the artificial painted precedents which have been produced, I might &s;till very con|&s;i&s;tently urge, that, the repeated and uniform requi&s;itions of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> mini&s;ters, as often as occa&s;ions for the <HI>&s;ingle purpo&s;e of revenue</HI> have happened, tran&s;mitted to the colonies to tax them&s;elves by pro|vincial acts, and the acts of parliament regulating the trade of the plantations, as well as of <HI>Ireland,</HI> without one in&s;tance, before the &s;tamp act, of a tax impo&s;ed by parliament upon either, for the <HI>un|mixed</HI> purpo&s;e of revenue prove, that the impo&s;ition of a tax upon them without their con&s;ent, hath con&s;tantly been held to be incon|&s;i&s;tent with their con&s;titutional rights and privileges. I have joined <HI>Ireland</HI> with the colonies, and pre&s;ume it will hardly be contended that <HI>Ireland,</HI> over which the courts of ju&s;tice in <HI>England</HI> have a &s;uper|intendant power, is not, at lea&s;t, as &s;ubject to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> as the colonies are.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t extraordinary rea&s;on hath been given, why the method of requi&s;ition would have been improper, <HI>viz.</HI> that
<Q>the &s;ums rai&s;ed mu&s;t be paid into the exchequer, and if levied by the provincial a&s;&s;emblies, the parliament would have no right to enquire into the expenditure of them.</Q>
This is &s;o extremely futile, that it would be almo&s;t ab&s;urd to be&s;tow a &s;erious refutation upon it.</P>
<P>Why mu&s;t the &s;ums rai&s;ed be paid into the exchequer?

might be adver&s;e, nece&s;&s;ity, and an alteration of tho&s;e circum|&s;tances, may accompli&s;h. When the alternative is propo&s;ed, and the one part of it a&s;&s;ures &s;ucce&s;s, and a comfortable &s;upport by a mode|rate application of indu&s;try, familiarized by u&s;e, and rendered ea&s;y by practice; and the other affording only an experiment of precarious i&s;&s;ue, calling for an application unexperienced and dreaded, attended with perplexity, and productive of irk&s;ome anxiety, the generality of mankind would not he&s;itate in choo&s;ing the former. But, though it would gain the preference of choice, yet, if the alternative is taken away, and choice yields to nece&s;&s;ity, the enterprizing will form pro|jects, the judicious improve, the indu&s;trious execute them.

From this change, different con&s;equences may be conjectured or foretold, and perhaps the mo&s;t confident might be di&s;appointed by the event. It is not &s;o difficult for men to &s;trike into new employments and methods of life, when impelled by the urgency of di&s;tre&s;s, nor &s;o ea&s;y to call them back to their old manner of life, and divert them from new pur&s;uits experienced to be profitable, and <HI>productive of the be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> as &s;ome &s;eem to apprehend.</P>
<P>It is not contended that the colonies ought to be indulged in a ge|neral liberty of exporting and importing every thing in what manner they plea&s;e, but, &s;ince they are hindered from making all the advan|tages they might do, and what advantages might they not make, if under no checks? they have a good plea again&s;t all rigour and &s;eve|rity, not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. That <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manufactures come dearer, and not &s;o good in quality to <HI>America,</HI> as formerly, is a very general complaint, and what effect it may have, &s;hould they &s;till grow dearer and wor&s;e in quality, or the colonies be rendered le&s;s able to con&s;ume them, is a con&s;ideration which concerns <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> at lea&s;t as much as the colonies. An increa&s;e of price, and falling in the good|ne&s;s of quality, is the u&s;ual effect of monopolies; there is no danger of foreigners taking advantage of this circum&s;tance in <HI>America,</HI> what|ever they may do in other countries, but the indu&s;try it may give ri&s;e to in <HI>America,</HI> when other circum&s;tances concur, is not difficult to be fore&s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="009958_0043_0F7B3EF90F604B68">It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the balance of trade between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her colonies, is con&s;iderably again&s;t the latter, and that no gold or &s;ilver mines have yet been di&s;covered in the old <HI>American</HI> &s;ettlements, or among the <HI>trea&s;ures</HI> of the new acqui&s;itions. How then is this balance to be di&s;charged?

<P>If in con&s;equence of the ob&s;tructions, or regulations as they are called, of their commerce, and the impo&s;ition of taxes upon their properties, the colonies &s;hould only be driven to ob&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t maxims of frugality, the con&s;equence would rather be di&s;agreeable than hurtful&mdash;&s;hould they be forced to u&s;e new methods of indu&s;try, and to have recour&s;e to arts for a &s;upply of nece&s;&s;aries, the difficulty in &s;ucceeding would prove le&s;s than the apprehen&s;ion of mi&s;carrying, and the benefit greater than the hope of it.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>BY the 12th <HI>Charles</HI> II&punc; the colonies are re&s;trained from &s;ending the products enumerated in the act to <HI>any foreign</HI> ports......By the 15th of the &s;ame king, they are prohibited from importing commodities of the growth or manufacture of <HI>Europe, except from Great-Britain,</HI> &s;aving a few articles mentioned in this act.</P>
<P>A law, which re&s;trains one part of the &s;ociety, from <HI>exporting</HI> its products to the mo&s;t profitable market, <HI>in favour of another</HI>; or obliges it to <HI>import</HI> the manufactures of one country that are dear, in&s;tead of tho&s;e of another that are cheap, is effectually a tax. For if the profitable <HI>exportation,</HI> and the <HI>importation</HI> of the cheaper commodi|ties were permitted, a tax equal &s;uch gain in the former ca&s;e, and to the &s;aving in the latter, would leave that part of the &s;ociety, in the &s;ame &s;tate and cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">on, as if under the prohibition and re&s;triction above mentioned. As for in&s;tance in the ca&s;e of <HI>importation.</HI>......Sup|po&s;e a country which I will di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of A, can pur|cha&s;e commodities of the &s;ame kind, and equal goodne&s;s, 20 <HI>per cent</HI> cheaper of B, than &s;he can of C;..........Then it is clear, if A is prohibited from taking the&s;e commodities of B, and obliged to purcha&s;e them of C, that A is ju&s;t in the &s;ame &s;tate and condition, as if &s;he were allowed to purcha&s;e the commodities of B, on paying thereon a duty of 20 <HI>per cent</HI> to C........This in&s;tance, <HI>mutatis mutan|dis,</HI> is equally applicable to the ca&s;e of <HI>exportation.</HI> Hence it appears, that the country favoured by the prohibition and re&s;triction, gains as much thereby, as it would do, if the proportionate tax were paid to it, upon taking off the prohibition and re&s;triction; or, in other words, the profit which the one is hindered from making, in con&s;equence of the prohibition and re&s;triction, is made by the other, in who&s;e favour they have been introduced.</P>
<P>It hath been ob&s;erved by a well-received writer on the &s;ubject of trade, that
<Q>a prohibition acknowledges the commodities it is laid on, to be good and cheap, otherwi&s;e it were needle&s;s, and a pro|hibition on the goods of any one nation, gives a monopoly to other nations, that rai&s;e the like.</Q>

The attentive reader will ob&s;erve&punc; that the net pro|ceeds of a hog&s;head of tobacco, at an average, are 4l. and the taxes 3l..... together 7l.&mdash;Quere, how much per cent does the tax amount to, which takes from the two wretched tobacco colonies, 3l. out of every 7l.? And how deplorable mu&s;t their circum&s;tances appear, when their va&s;t debt to the mother country, and the annual burthen of their civil e&s;tabli&s;hments are added to the e&s;timate? In the&s;e two colonies there are upwards of 180,000 taxables.</NOTE> wherefore, on 30,000 hog&s;heads, the planters get 120,000l. How much of the above &s;um of 831,000l. is net to the revenue, I &s;hall not undertake to &s;ay; but I pre&s;ume it may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that no part of this, or any other public money, is touched by any <HI>Americans,</HI> whether <HI>they have great po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers of &s;peech</HI> or not; tho' any gentleman who might be affected by it, is not to be blamed for his apprehen&s;ion, that a <HI>&s;udden importation</HI> of a certain commodity, might hurt the <HI>home</HI> market.</P>
<P>The &s;um of the taxes, paid in <HI>North-America,</HI> will appear enor|mous to tho&s;e, who, having been told that the&s;e colonies pay only 7 or 800 l. <HI>per annum,</HI> in con&s;equence of taxes laid <HI>there,</HI> might be led, in their dependence upon <HI>mini&s;terial candor,</HI> to believe, that they paid no more <HI>el&s;ewhere</HI>;......but to others, who are better acquainted with the &s;ubject, the computation will appear too low.&mdash;From the&s;e ob|&s;ervations it may be inferred what va&s;t wealth, in <HI>taxes only,</HI> the mo|ther country has, in the cour&s;e of a hundred years, drawn from her colonies; and how <HI>profoundly well-informed</HI> the writer is, who, with equal pertinency and mode&s;ty, pronounces,
<Q>that it is <HI>now</HI> high time for <HI>England</HI> to draw &s;ome <HI>little</HI> profit from her colonies, af|ter the <HI>va&s;t trea&s;ure &s;he has expended on their &s;ettlement.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I confe&s;s that the above computations are conjectural, but I believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey are probable. I mean that tho&s;e, who are be&s;t acquanited with the &s;ubject, will think the charge upon <HI>North-America</HI> is not exagge|rated, and which I think very naturally accounts for the eno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mous debt &s;he at pre&s;ent labours under to the mother-country.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="009958_0054_0F7B3F0378F4EAD8">Dr. <HI>Davenant</HI> ob&s;erves, that,
<Q>if ever any thing great or good be done for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colonies, indu&s;try mu&s;t have its due recom|pence, and that cannot he without encouragement to it, which, perhaps is only to be brought about by <HI>confirming their liberties,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;hing good di&s;cipline among them; that, as they &s;ee they are a free people, in point of government, &s;o they may, by di&s;cipline, be kept free of the mi&s;chiefs that follow vice and idlene&s;s. And, as great care &s;hould be taken in this re&s;pect, &s;o without doubt, it is advi&s;eable, that no little emulation of private intere&s;ts of neighbour governors, nor that the petitions of <HI>hungry courtiers</HI> at home, &s;hould prevail to di&s;courage tho&s;e particular colonies, who, in a few years, have rai&s;ed them&s;elves by their <HI>own charge, prudence and indu&s;try,</HI> to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wealth and greatne&s;s they are now arrived at, <HI>without any ex|pence to the crown</HI>; upon which account, any <HI>innovations,</HI> or <HI>breach</HI> of their <HI>original charters,</HI> (be&s;ides that it &s;eems a <HI>breach</HI> of the <HI>pub|lic faith</HI>) may, peradventure, not tend to the king's profit.</Q>
Ex|cellent ob&s;ervation! but how little it hath been regarded, the pr&s;eent deeply-afflicting di&s;tre&s;s of the inhabitants of <HI>North-America</HI> demon|&s;trates;&mdash;a di&s;tre&s;s &s;ufficient to drive men into di&s;pair, who are not animated by the hope, that&mdash;DEUS DABIT HIS QUOQUE FINEM. <HI>God &s;hall al&s;o put an End to the&s;e.</HI></P>
