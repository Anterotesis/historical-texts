<L>WHEN o'er Columbia's fields in fearful hour,</L>

<L>And war and de&s;olation mark'd its path:</L>
<L>Rous'd by the fury of her ruthle&s;s foes,</L>
<L>The angry Genius of Columbia ro&s;e:</L>
<L>Then, with a voice more loud, more deep than fate,</L>

<L>She called the <HI>great Republic</HI> into day,</L>
<L>And to a world, re&s;tored its legal &s;way:</L>
<L>Behold; her patriot hand the low lands fills</L>
<L>Like to the torrents of a thou&s;and hills,</L>
<L>Which thund'ring to the plain their waters roll,</L>
<L>Unite, conden&s;e, and form a mighty whole;</L>
<L>Columbia's Sons down Alleghany's sides,</L>
<L>Their fiery cohorts pour in rapid tides:</L>
<L>Whil&s;t o'er the gla&s;&s;y &s;urface of the flood,</L>
<L>Light'd by the Sun, a gallant ve&s;&s;el rode;</L>
<L>The Ark which bears the charter of the land,</L>
<L>It &s;ails directed by the Almighty hand:</L>
<L>'Till &s;afe at length from tempe&s;t and from flood,</L>
<L>Secure on fredom's Ararat it &s;tood.</L>
<L>Thus did this great, this glorious Empire ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Which lifts its patriot honors to the &s;kies;</L>
<L>Spite of the bloody la&s;h, the tyrant's frown,</L>
