<P>THe wise Man doth justly condemn the fol|ly of those, that are alwayes saying and complaining, <HI>what is the cause that the former dayes were better than these</HI>?

The present aspect of Providence is dismal on more accounts than one; especially in that God hath been <HI>removing the Pillars</HI> of this Generation, even <HI>those</HI> that have <HI>stood in the Gap,</HI> and would have done much towards keeping out a <HI>Deluge</HI> of overflowing Judgements. It is not eleven years since <HI>Mitchel</HI> dyed (not to speak of others whom this Generation lost at that time, for one such stroke seldome goes alone) and all New-England shook when that Pillar fell to the ground. <HI>For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still</HI>: Of late, He that holds the stars in his right hand hath caused some of our <HI>brightest Lights to set;</HI> and is not that a sign of darkness to follow?

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GOd in his Providence doth many times so order, as that <HI>the last words</HI> of his eminent Servants shall be of most weighty Consideration. The Scripture sets a special Emphasis and Remark upon the last words of David 2. Sam. 23.1. <HI>now these are the</HI> last words <HI>of David the sweet singer of Israel</HI>; not that he never spake any words af|ter those, but they were expressed by him to|wards the Close of his dayes, not very long before he left the world. The same is to be said concerning the words now before us; They are amongst the <HI>last,</HI> yea, the dying
<PB N="2" REF="000393_0007_0FA5A80AF25089F8">
speeches of that holy man of God; who per|ceiving that the time of his departure was at hand, layeth a most solemn Charge upon his son Solomon, that he should endeavour to ap|prove himself a faithful Servant of his Fathers God. Several Arguments are made use of to back this Charge; one is in these words, ta|ken from the benefit which would attend a <HI>sincere seeking</HI> the Lord. <HI>If thou seek him, he will be found of thee</HI>; that is to say, thou shalt then be made happy in the enjoyment of God for ever. If <HI>others</HI> seek God in sincerity of heart, they shall find him, but (saith David) it is eminently true concerning <HI>thee,</HI> because the Lord hath been thy Fathers God. Thou art a Child of a Father that had a special inter|est in God, and therefore if thou set thy self to seek him, know for thy encouragement, that he will be most ready to shew himself favour|able to thee. Wherefore the Doctrine which may at present be insisted on from the words, is,</P>
<P>DOCT. That <HI>The Children of godly parents are under peculiar Advantages &amp; Encouragements to seek the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>For the Clea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of this Doctrine, 2 Things may be attended. 1. To enquire what is im|plyed in this <HI>Seeking the Lord</HI> which the Text speaketh of, 2. How it does appear that the Children of godly parents are under peculiar Advantages and Encouragements so to doe.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="000393_0008_0FA5A80BB9160380">QUEST. 1. <HI>What is Implyed in this</HI> seek|ing <HI>the Lord</HI>?</P>
<P>ANSW. 1. <HI>It doth imply that men by nature are such as have lost God.</HI> The sinner hath lost himself, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.32. <HI>this thy brother was</HI> lost, <HI>and is found.</HI> Yea, and he hath lost God too, He is wandred from his Fathers house. Hence the Apostle said to the <HI>Ephesians, they were with|out God in the world.</HI> Yea, it is true concern|ing children of godly parents as well as others <HI>Ephs.</HI> 2.3. <HI>we</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>were by na|ture the Children of wrath even as others.</HI> We that are Jews and descended of holy Ancestors, we that are now converted, and made A|postles of Christ, by nature were Subjects of the wrath and righteous displeasure of God&punc; Not but that some of the Children of godly men have Grace wrought in them whilest in a state of Infancy, as <HI>John Baptist</HI> was filled with the Holy Ghost from his mothers womb, but they do not derive that grace from their parents, and therefore it is not natural, but supernatural, when any of the Children of sin|ful men are made gracious.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Seeking the Lord doth imply a sense of this lost condition.</HI> Sense of want puts men upon <HI>seeking.</HI> The Prodigal was hunger-bitten be|fore he would seek to be reconciled to his Fa|ther, when he saw that he was fain to live upon husks, and that there was no way but he
<PB N="4" REF="000393_0009_0FA5A80C73C43E38">
must perish with hunger, except he sought un|to his Father for a supply, he would do so. If a man hath lost a thing, except he know that he hath lost it, he will not seek after it. Hence in the Parable concerning the lost peice of silver, it is said, <HI>what woman if she lose a peice of silver, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till shee find it, Luk.</HI> 15.8. So that there must be sense of Loss before there will be seeking or finding. Nor will men seek the Lord except they be by his Spirit made sensible, that they have lost his favour, and are through sin and the Fall be|come miserable.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This seeking doth imply earnest desire to find God.</HI> That which a man seeketh after he would be glad to find. When Job fought af|ter Communion with God, he maketh enquiry, <HI>where shall I find him?</HI> Chapt. 23.3. No one will seek after that which is not an object of his desires, <HI>Psal.</HI> 27.4. <HI>One thing have I desired, that will I seek after.</HI> If thou seek him, that is to say, if thou earnestly desire to find the Lord, then so it shall be. If God be the chief Object of thy desires, if the desire of thy soul be towards the remembrance of his Name, then he will be found of thee. As it was with David himself, <HI>Psa.</HI> 63.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1. <HI>O God thou art my God, early will I seek thee; my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, in a dry and
<PB N="5" REF="000393_0010_0FA5A80E95682210">
thirsty Land where no water is.</HI> How are the desires and affections of a thirsty man carried out after water, in a thirsty Land where no water is? When the desires of the soul are in like manner carried out after God, that is seeking him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Seeking the Lord does imply Diligence in the use of meanes in order to obtaining the favour of God.</HI> The end implyes the meanes which is necessary in order to obtaining that end, now the favour of God is the end of this seeking. Hence 'tis called a seeking his face, <HI>i. e.</HI> his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a|vour. <HI>Psal.</HI> 10<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.4 <HI>Seek the Lord's face.</HI> and the meanes in order to obtaining that end is Repentance of former sins, Faith in the Righteousness of Jesus Christ, (<HI>Jer.</HI> 50.5.) walking according to the holy Rules of the Word of God, which is therefore called <HI>a walk|ing in all well pleasing before the Lord,</HI> Inasmuch as so to walk is the way to find the continu|ance of Divine Favour.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Seeking the Lord doth imply the worship and service of God.</HI> As they that do not worship God are said to be such as seek him not, <HI>Isai.</HI> 65.1. <HI>I am found of them that sought me not,</HI> meaning that the Gentiles who in former times did not own and worship the true God, should be brought to the knowledge of him. So to seek God is to worship him, 2. Chron. 11..16.
<PB N="6" REF="000393_0011_0FA5A81021F61B68">
It is said, <HI>that such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel</HI> i. e. to worship him, <HI>came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the Lord God of their Fathers.</HI> It is true, that in special that great duty of prayer (which is a special part of re|ligious worship) is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nded, yet not that on|ly; all other parts of Divine Worship are comprehended under this expression, Hence it is in the Context noted by that of <HI>serving the Lord.</HI> Now to Serve GOD is to worship him aright. <HI>We</HI> (said they in Ezra) <HI>are the servants of the God of Heaven,</HI> meaning that they did worship none else but him, so that a Servant of the Lord is the same with a worshiper of him. This <HI>seeking</HI> is here set in in opposition to <HI>forsaking</HI> God. Now Forsak|ing hath a special respect to that sin of Idolatry and false Worship. David was a man that was very faithful to God in the matters of his worship: As for Idols he would not so much as name them <HI>Psal.</HI> 16.4. And we read in the Sacred history of David, that when he had subdued his Enemies, he burnt their Images and Idols, in an holy indignation at the sin of Idolatry: Now he doth exhort his son Solo|mon to follow his Father's steps, in being Loyal to God in the matters of his worship. All these particulars may be intended here. <HI>If thou seek the Lord</HI> h. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. if thou art sensible of thy left estate by nature, so as to desire re|conciliation with God in the first place, and
<PB N="7" REF="000393_0012_0FA5A8111B258DF0">
dost therefore repent of Sin and believe in Christ, and continuest to worship and serve God according to his own will, then be assured that thou shalt enjoy his favour, and be ever|lastingly blessed.</P>
<P>We come now to the second thing propound|ed, viz.</P>
<P>QUEST. 2. <HI>How doth it appear that the children of godly parents are under peculiar Ad|vantages and Encouragements to seek the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>ANSW. 1. <HI>In that the vein of Election do run through the loyns of godly Parents for the most part?</HI> Tho it be not wholly and only so, that Elect Parents have none but elect Children, or that elect children are alwaies born of elect Pa|rents <NOTE N="[a]" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Mr. <HI>Carter of Abraham's Covenant, p&punc;</HI> 38.30. <HI>&amp;</HI> Dr. <HI>Winter of Infant Bapt. pag.</HI> 37&punc;</NOTE> yet God hath seen meet to cast <HI>y^e</HI> line of election so, as that generally elect Children are cast upon elect Parents. <HI>John</HI> directs one of his Epistles, To the elect Lady and her Children, whom he also found walking in the Truth: Not only the Mother but the Child|ren did belong to God. As usually so it is, that if the Mother be elect, at least wise some of the Children are so too. There are many Scriptures which do intimate this Truth, <HI>Psal.</HI> 105.8. <HI>He hath remembred his Covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand gene|rations.</HI> Intimating both that the longer a ge-Generation
<PB N="8" REF="000393_0013_0FA5A812A50A0E40">
does continue godly, the more gra|cious will the Lord be to the seed and posteri|ity, &amp; that there are some that in a continued succession for many generations the Lord hath chosen, Hence <HI>Psal.</HI> 103.17. <HI>The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto childrens Children.</HI> Shewing that God from Eternity hath designed mercy to some Parents and to their children, and their Childrens Children, <HI>Isa..</HI> 59. ult. <HI>My Spirit which is upon thee, and any words which I have put into thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed saith the Lord, from hence forth and for ever.</HI> To the same purpose is that, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.25. What more plain can be spoken, to shew that God doth many times cast elect chil|dren upon elect Parents in a continued successi|on from generation to generation? See also <HI>Isa.</HI> 65.22, 23. <HI>Mine Elect and their</HI> off-spring <HI>with them are the blessed of the Lord.</HI> So that when Parents are Elect, usually their Children are so too. Hence it was said to Zacheus, <HI>Sal|vation is come to thy house,</HI> Luk. 19.9. Not on|ly to his Soul but to his <HI>house.</HI> Usually if God intends to save a man, there are some of his house <HI>i. e.</HI> posterity that are heirs of Sal|vation also. And therefore the Apostle said to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Jaylor, <HI>believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> shalt be saved and thy house, Act.</HI> 16.31. How did Paul know that if the Jaylor be|believed
<PB N="9" REF="000393_0014_0FA5A81339E0D560">
his Children should be saved? was it from any special Revelation concerning those Children more than with respect unto others? no; but he knew that when God brought the Father into a state of Salvation, he was wont to save however <HI>some</HI> of his Children and Post|erity. Hence also Paul said to Timothy, <HI>when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith in thee, which dwelt first in thy Grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice, and I am perswaded in thee al|so.</HI> 2. Tim. 1.5. he doth probably &amp; hopefully conclude that Timothy did belong to God, be|cause he was the son of a godly mother and Grand-mother. Moreover, Experience and observation does confirm this Truth, that <HI>de facto</HI> it hath been so. For the Elect are not found in all places alike, but in some Nations more than in others, and that for many gene|rations successively. And in some Families more than in others: There are some Families in the world, that God hath designed to shew peculiar mercy to them, from generation to generation. And if an account should be ta|ken concerning all the godly men that are now alive in the world, doubtless it would be found that the greatest part of them are sprung from godly Parents. Though there may be many converted ones in the world, whose Parents did not fear God; yet for the Generality of true believers they are such as have descended from believing Parents.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="000393_0015_0FA5A81435474458">2. <HI>The Lord hath established his Covenant not only with Parents, but with Children also.</HI> Gen. 17.7. <HI>I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generati|ons, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee.</HI> The Saints in all Ages are concerned in Abrahams Covenant, under which Children are Comprehended. To say that the Covenant was extended to Children under the Old Testament, but not under the New, is to lessen the Grace of God in these dayes of the Gospel. Yea then the Jews would have been great losers by believ|ing on Christ: If they could have said, in former times our Children were interested in the gracious Covenant of God, but if we em|brace the Gospel they shall have no part in the Lord, this would have been such an objection against believing as could never have have bin answered. Wherefore, we shall find that those Scriptures which relate to Gospel times, expresly declare, That not only Believers themselves, but their Children also are sub|jects of the Lords gracious Covenant with his People. <HI>Isai.</HI> 61.8.9. <HI>I will make an ever|lasting Covenant with them and their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their Off-spring among the People; all that see them shall acknow|ledge that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed.</HI> And Chapt. 65, ver. 23, <HI>They are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their off-spring
<PB N="11" REF="000393_0016_0FA5A814C08AFE08">
with them.</HI> Now this Consideration is a great encouragement to seek the Lord; So it was to them. <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.22. <HI>We come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</HI> We are thy Covenant-people, and that does encourage us to come unto thee. And this did encourage David to seek and hope for the Lords Salvati|on <HI>Ps.</HI> 86.16. <HI>Save the son of thine handmaid.</HI> And the Apostle did encourage the Jews to re|pent and return unto the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this Ar|gument, <HI>viz.</HI> in that they were <HI>the childr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of the covenant</HI> Act. 3.19, 25. From thence it is Evident that the Children of godly Parents stand in a peculiar relation unto God, and that therefore he will not cast them off, except there be great cause for it: Not surely as long as they seek him, and desire to return to him and serve him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There are special promises belonging to such Children.</HI> Not only the Covenant in general which is, as it were, a <HI>Constellation</HI> of glorious Promises, but there are peculiar Promises made concerning them. There is a promise that they shall be blessed above other Children <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sa.</HI> 112.1, 2. <HI>Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, his seed shall be mighty on the earth, the generation of the upright shall be blessed.</HI> And that successively from one generation to another, Psa. 102.28. <HI>The children of thy serva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts shall continue, &amp; their seed shall be establisht b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, are thee.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="000393_0017_0FA5A817B84FA258">
In another place, David speaking concerning the Children of God's servants, and that in the dayes of the Messiah, saith <HI>A seed shall serve him, it</HI> shall be <HI>accounted to the Lord for a gene|ration.</HI> Psa. 22.30. intimating that the Lord will uphold among the Children of his people a certain number that shall be owned as a race of Gods Children. And therefore we have a Promise of converting grace to be bestowed on such children, <HI>Deut.</HI> 30.6. <HI>The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed.</HI> There is a promise <HI>for</HI> grace as well as <HI>to</HI> grace, as to those that belong to the E|lection of Grace. Circumcision of heart im|plyeth Regeneration, which is promised to the Lords servants with respect unto their Child|ren; And that was one reason why the Lord did of old appoint Circumcision to be applyed to the Children of his people, that so this promise of converting Grace in due time to be vouchsafed, might be sealed. The same thing is promised <HI>Isai.</HI> 44.3. <HI>I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine off-spring.</HI> And the Lord hath made a blessed promise of salvation to such children, <HI>Isai.</HI> 49.25. <HI>I will save thy Children.</HI> Hence it is. promised that <HI>the seed of the Lords servants shall inherit Sion</HI> Psa. 69.36. Which word is made good in these dayes of the Gospel, by giving Hea|ven to the Children of believers as their ever|lasting Inheritance. Now albeit these promi|promises
<PB N="13" REF="000393_0018_0FA5A817C65692E8">
do not absolutely respect all the chil|dren of every godly man, only the elect among them, yet they are generally and indefinitely propounded; and that is encouragement as to Parents to pray for their children, yea for all of them, as it was to David 1. <HI>Chron.</HI> 17, 3 last ver. <HI>O my God, thou hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house, therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee. And now Lord, thou art that God that hast promised this goodness to thy servant; now there|fore let it please thee to bless the house</HI> (i. e. the Family and posterity) <HI>of thy servant that it may be before thee for ever; for thou blessest O Lord and it shall be blessed for ever.</HI> So it is a wond|erful encouragement to the Children of holy men to seek unto the Lord for grace and Sal|vation for themselves: The Child of a godly man may come before the Lord, and say Lord thou hast promised to bestow Grace, and give eternal blessings unto those that are the Child|ren of such as fear thy Name, my Father, my Mother thou knowest did fear thy Name, why then may not that promise belong to me?</P>

order to obtaining mercy for their children. For they have a great natural affection toward their Children, which wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n it is sanctified, maketh them to be the more earnest with God for them. If a child were to ask prayers for his Life, let him desire the prayers of his Father, if his Father be indeed one that hath an Inter|est in Heaven. It is said in the fifth Comman|dement, <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy dayes may be long in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</HI> Exod. 20, 12. because as for dutiful Children, their parents are en|gaged to pray much for them, and by that means do lengthen out their dayes. In the Hebrew it is <HI>they shall prolong thy dayes</HI> h. e. thy Father and thy mother shall do so. How should they do it? <NOTE N="[b]" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Dr&punc; Owen on</HI> Psa. 130. <HI>pag.</HI> 218.</NOTE> even by praying for their Posterity, and blessing them in the Name of the Lord, and by that means prolonging their dayes not only upon the Earth, but to Eternity in Heaven, of which the Land of Ca|naan was a Type. The Prayers of godly Pa|rents have a great Influence and Interest for the obtaining blessings temporal, spiritual, and eternal for their Children. Abraham's prayer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for Ishmael prevailed farr, and his prayers for Isaac prevayled further, <HI>Abraham</HI> said unto God, O that <HI>Ishmael</HI> might live be|fore thee, and God said, as for Ishmael I have

heard thee, behold I have blessed him, but my Covenant will I establish with <HI>Isaac</HI>: Es|pecially if parents pray in Faith. As some|times a father hath a particular Faith for such a child. As to those that have much Commu|nion with God and know much of his mind, many times it is so, that a believing parent can say, as for such a child I know he shall be bless|ed and made a blessing, I have surely prevayl|ed with God for him. As Isaac said of Jacob <HI>Gen.</HI> 27.33. <HI>I have blessed him and he shall be blessed</HI>; so a godly parent can sometimes say, such a child of mine, Christ hath blessed him, yea, and he shall be blessed for ever. Now this is a great encouragement to children, that Prayer and Faith hath been acting for them: Yea that a <HI>Stock</HI> of Prayers hath been laid up for them. Is it not a great encouragement unto a child when he can say, my g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cious Fa|ther hath carried my name before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od in se|cret many a Thousand time, even every day &amp; night since I was born into the world? certain|ly these prayers shall not fall to the ground.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Such Children have blessed Examples set before them.</HI> Now that's a great advantage.

Or as the same Apostle said to Timothy, <HI>Thou hast known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Doctrine and manner of life,</HI> 2. <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m.</HI> 3.10. Timothy was Intimate with Paul and therefore doubtless knew more of his se|cret way of walking and Communion with God, than was known or imagined by the world; so do children observe more of their Parents holy Course of life than others do, which is no small advantage. A Child is wit|ness of his Father's Zeal, Faith, Patience; he seeth that his Father is conscientious and ho|ly, and much in prayer to God. Now what an advantage is this? He needs not goe farr to see how he ought to walk and please God, for he seeth it before his eyes every day, by the Example and Coppy his Father sets before him. Moreover, it is a great encouragement unto the Child of a godly Parent, when he can think and say, my Father did serve God, and the Lord accepted of him, therefore if he serve God he will accept of me. My Father did repent and believe and walk in the way of holiness, God blessed him &amp; his family; there|therefore

if I walk in the steps of my Fathers Faith and Obedience, the God of my Father will bless me and mine for ever.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The Children of wicked men fall under hea|vy curses and Threatnings</HI>; Therefore they are godly mens Children unto whom peculiar En|couragements to seek the Lord do appertain; As for wicked transgressors, they are cursed not only in their persons, but in their Poste|rity, even cursed in the fruit of their body, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28.15. <HI>The house</HI> (i. e. the Children) <HI>of the wicked shall be overthrown.</HI> Prov. 14.11. <HI>The seed of evil doers shall never be renowned, pre|pare slaughter for his Children for the iniquity of his Fathers,</HI> Isai. 14.20, 21. It is true, that if a Child do unfeignedly repent and turn to God, though his parents should have been never so wicked, God will accept of him; The repenting son shall not be damned meerly for his Father's iniquity, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.14. But it is more rare for such Children ever to repent; and if they do not repent, they shall be punished for their Fathers and Mo|ther's sins as well as for their own, because they justifie them by doing like them. How many Examples are there Recorded in the Scripture of God's punishing Children with their Parents and because of their Sin? So Achan's Children, and Dathan's and Abiram's; yea, Millions of Children that were drowned
<PB N="18" REF="000393_0023_0FA5A81B9BCC7098">
and damned with their cursed parents in No|ah's Flood; and when Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed, not only the parents but the Children perished, and now suffer together the vengeance of eternal fire; and was not an express Charge given Concerning the little ones of the Amalekites, Midianites &amp;c. that they should be destroyed with their Fa|thers? Thus doth the Lord recompence the iniquity of the fathers into the bosome of their Children.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>We find in the Scripture that the Children of holy men have bin encouraged from this consi|deration, That they were so related to such as had a special interest in God.</HI> &mdash; So Jacob, Gen. 31.5. <HI>The God of my Father hath been with me.</HI> and ver. 42. <HI>except the God of my Father and Fear of Isaac had been with me,</HI> and Chapt. 32.9. <HI>Ja|cob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac.</HI> He was greatly encouraged in looking up to God from that very Conside|ration, that the Lord was the God of his Fa|ther, and God of his Grand-Father. So Moses <HI>Exod.</HI> 18.4. <HI>The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.</HI> and David Psa. 116.16. <HI>O Lord, truly I am thy Servant; I am thy servant, the son of thy Hand|maid:</HI> Inasmuch as his mother was a precious godly woman, he was encouraged to plead his Interest in God. So Solomon, 1. <HI>King.</HI> 8.15. <HI>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with
<PB N="19" REF="000393_0024_0FA5A81C460DE570">
our Fathers, let him not leave us nor forsake us.</HI> Inasmuch as the Lord was their fathers God, Solomon and the Lords people with him had their hearts drawn forth to hope that he would be their God also, so as never to forsake them. And Daniel's heart was enlarged in giving praises to God, since he could say, <HI>I thank thee O thou God of my Fathers who hast given me wis|dome.</HI> Dan. 2.23.</P>
<P>These things then make it evident that such children are under peculiar encouragement to seek the Lord.</P>
<P>USE. 1. <HI>Hence it is a great mercy to be born and brought up under godly parents.</HI> Though some make a light matter of it, like Esau that said <HI>what good shall this birth-right doe me</HI>? he despised his birth-right; but the things men|tioned make it to be a mercy indeed. To be under the wing of the covenant tho but as to the external dispensation of it is it self a mer|cy. To have the meanes of Grace vouchsafed, (which is ever wont to follow upon a cove|nant-interest in God) is mercy: Wherefore the Apostle having propounded that question, <HI>What advantage hath the Jew above the Gentile?</HI> maketh Answer, <HI>much every way, chiefly in that to them are committed the Oracles of God.</HI> Rom. 3.2. Next unto Christ and the Spirit of grace, the blessed Bible is the greatest gift that

This is wont to be the portion of godly mens Children. And to have the benefit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> private instructions, admonitions, exhortati|ons is a great mercy; Solomon confesseth that his father and his mother taught him good doctrine; Prov. 4.2.

Nor are the children of godly men with|out this benefit, Psal. 34.11. <HI>Come you child|ren hearken to me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</HI> It is a great mercy to be taught and principled in the fear of God, and that be|times: to be told of the evil of sin, the infi|nite danger of dying in a natural, unconverted estate, the necessity of obtaining an interest in Christ, and to be directed in the right way to salvation. Also to be the subjects of much pray|er is great mercy; It's mentioned concerning <HI>Solomon</HI> as a special Favour God would vouch|safe to him, <HI>Psal.</HI> 72.15. <HI>Prayer shall be made for him continually.</HI> Thus concerning the
<PB N="21" REF="000393_0026_0FA5A81DAEC52118">
children of the Lords people, the publique prayers of the Church reach them; and their godly parents are dayly praying for them; so that prayer is made for them continually. Moreover such children experience outward blessings and preservations for their parents sake. It is said concerning him that feareth God, <HI>his children shall find a place of Refuge</HI> Pro. 14.26. And the Lord said to Abraham con|cerning Ishmael <HI>Gen.</HI> 21.13. <HI>I will make a na|tion of him because he is thy seed.</HI> And God spared Solomon for his father Davids sake, &mdash; 1. <HI>King.</HI> 11.34. And as for Jehoram, all his children were destroyed save one, and that one had been cut off too, had it not been for the respect which the Lord did bear to his blessed fore-Father 1. <HI>Kin.</HI> 8.19. Yea, &amp; such children have a greater blessing with that out|ward state which God in his Providence shall see meet to cast upon them, than the Child|ren of wicked men usually have, tho' it may be they have not so much of the world as some others, yet since what they have was gotten in a way of righteousness, a Blessing cometh along with it. For this cause David saith, <HI>a little that a righteous man hath is better than the Riches of many wicked.</HI> Psal. 37.16.</P>
<P>Use. 2. <HI>Hence we ought to nourish hope concern|ing such children, &amp; that above what can be said with respect to the Children of other parents.</HI> But some one may object &amp; say, Have not good men

bad Children? Godly men ungodly Children? How then is there Ground of Hope with respect unto such Children in Peculiarwise?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This is sadly true; the Most High to shew the soveraignty of his Grace, sometimes chooseth some of the Children of a wicked parent, and refuseth some of those who are the off-spring of godly parents; Also to shew that it is not in the power of men to give grace, no not in the power of godly men, so much as to their own Children; sometimes such children prove very unlike unto their godly parents. It was therefore said to Sam|uel, <HI>thy sons do not walk in thy wayes,</HI> 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 8.5. And that profane <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oiakim</HI>&punc; how un|like was he to his blessed Father <HI>Josiah</HI>? It is noted concerning Josiah, that when the word of God was read to him, he rent his clothes, humbled himself, and was afraid of the Lords holy displeasure; but <HI>Jehoiakim after three or four leaves were read, he took his pen-knife, and cut the Roll in peices, and burnt it in the fire, he was not afraid nor rent his Clothes,</HI> Jer. 36.23, 24. Yet this is further to be added and considered that when the Children of good men are unlike their parents in grace and Ho|liness it proceeds not from any unfaithfulness in the blessed God as to his Covenant with such parents, or with their children. for</P>
<P N="1">1. Usually it is some evil in such parents (though otherwise godly) which the Lord
<PB N="23" REF="000393_0028_0FA5A81F5EB363E8">
doth punish in their Children; either they were not so diligent in teaching and instruct|ing them as they ought to be; If we must judge all those parents ungodly whose Child|ren are miserably instructed I am certain that many amongst us who have a name to live, &amp; would be thought to have the root of the mat|ter in them, will be found among the ungodly: Or parents are sinfully indulgent towards their Children; so was Eli, indeed he instruct|ed them, told them of the evil of those waies they walked in, and exhorted them to re|form but he corrected and restrained them not: Isaac was too indulgent towards his profane Esau; So was David towards Absa|lom, that afterwards proved a Rebel, rising up in armes against his own Father: And he did sinfully indulge Adonijah, the Scripture takes notice of it, that <HI>his father had not dis|pleased him at any time, in saying why hast thou done so?</HI> 1. King. 1.6. No wonder he came to such an unhappy End, for usually such children are first or last a shame to the father that begat them, and bitterness to the mother that bare them. Or it may be parents do not pray and believe for their Children as they ought to doe; God in this case sometimes faith unto parents, according to your faith be it done unto you: If you pray much, &amp; believe much for your children, you shall obtain much Mercy from the Lord for them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 33. <HI>ult.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="24" REF="000393_0029_0FA5A8202B1CF8D8">2. Many times the Children of godly men are like their parents. In some godly families all the children thereof are made partakers of converting saving grace: So in Jacobs Family; there is reason to believe that his twelve sons did repent before they died and they are now in Heaven, considering that they were Types of the Elect of God, and their names were written upon the breast of the High Priest, when he entered into the Holy of Holies. So concerning Job's children, the Scripture saith, that after the death of his Children and the loss of his estate, the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before, yet he had but ten Children after that, which was the number he had before, wherefore Interpreters probably conclude that his other Children were not lost; they might all goe to Heaven notwithstanding the sad and sudden death which befel them. And Experience confirms the truth of this, we see that in some Families God is pleased to be|stow converting Grace upon all the children therein, especially if their parents be very much in prayer to God for them. I remember I once heard an holy praying man say, my Fa|ther had six children, and they are all either with Christ, or in Christ; and he hath given me six children, three of them are already with Christ, and the other (I bless his name) are in Christ. And I have read of one <NOTE N="[c]" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Fulfilling of the Script. pag.</HI> 442.</NOTE> who held
<PB N="25" REF="000393_0030_0FA5A8234253E2E0">
much Communion with God, that once said to an intimate friend, I <HI>have this day obtained mer|cy from God, not only for my self, but also for all mine,</HI> and evident signs of regenerating grace did afterwards appear in all his Children.</P>
<P N="3">3. God is w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to remember &amp; establish his co|venat with <HI>some</HI> of the children of his Servants however; if not to all yet with <HI>some</HI> of them. It's commonly seen that as for wicked parents, though they have many children&punc; they are all ungodly, like their Parents; but it is seldom known that if a godly man hath many Children that they all prove wicked; first or last God converteth some of them. If their be an Ishma|el in Abraham's Family, there is also an Isaac: if there be an Esau in Isaac's Family, there is also a <HI>Jacob:</HI> If there be an Absalom in Davids Family, there is also a Solomon; nor ought we to doubt but that Nathan and many more of David's children are now in Heaven, albeit three of them perished.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the Lord cast off the Immediate seed he remembers his Covenant to others that are more remote: Esau was hated, yet it is conceived by learned men that Job and his godly friends were of Isaacs posterity by Esau. <HI>Samuels</HI> son <HI>Joel</HI> was not like his father but his grand-child <HI>Heman</HI> was an excellent Prophet, like his blessed Grand-father; yea,
<PB N="26" REF="000393_0031_0FA5A8240FEA4B88">
and many of Samuel's great grand-children were faithful Ministers in the House of God, 1. <HI>Chron.</HI> 6.3. and 25.5, 6. The Lord has sometimes cast off a few generations, &amp; yet at last remembers his Covenant made with blessed Ancestors, <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI> 31.17. <HI>There is hope in thine end</HI> (h. e. as to after generations there is hope) <HI>saith the Lord, that thy Children shall come again to their own Border.</HI> There is then cause to nourish hope concerning such Children; there is so with respect to succeeding Generations in <HI>New-England:</HI> Albeit there is doleful Degene|racy appearing in the face of this generation, and no man can say but that a considerable part of the present generation will perish both temporally and eternally, yet there are some that the Lord will remember his Covenant with, even a remnant according to Election that shall be saved. We may say of <HI>New-England</HI>'s Children (many of them) as the Apostle speaketh concerning the Jews, however the case may be with them at the present, <HI>they are beloved for their Fathers sake,</HI> Rom. 11.28.</P>
<P>USE. 3. <HI>Hence Parents should be careful how they approve themselves for their poor children's (as well as for their own) sake.</HI> There are e|specially Three things that Parents should be carefull about for their Childrens Sake.</P>
<P N="1">1. That they be in a state of grace themselvs;
<PB N="27" REF="000393_0032_0FA5A8249F257320">
that they have a special and saving interest in God. As David said to his son Solomon, 1&punc; <HI>Chron.</HI> 28.20. <HI>The Lord God, even</HI> my <HI>God will be with thee</HI>; So if you can upon good grounds say, <HI>The Lord is</HI> my <HI>God,</HI> you may the better hope he will be with your <HI>Children.</HI> If you be indeed righteous in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of God, 'twill be your poor childrens advantage <HI>Ps.</HI> 37.25 <HI>I have been young and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his</HI> seed <HI>beg|ging bread.</HI> But if you be unconverted, and Christless, what a case are your Children in? that if they be in any distress, they have a fa|ther that cannot Pray for them, or if he do, his prayers find no acceptance with God, be|cause they proceed from one that hath not an interest in Heaven. Remember that Scripture <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.29. <HI>O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments alwayes, that it might be well with them, and with their</HI> Children <HI>forever!</HI> plainly intimating that if Parents truly fear God, their children shall fare the better for it; Yea, let me tell you, that then if any of them dye in their Infancies <NOTE N="[d]" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Mr. Whiston's Primitive practice&punc; of In|fant Baptism.</HI></NOTE> you need not doubt of their salvation, <HI>Deut.</HI> 30.19. <HI>Thou and thy</HI> seed <HI>shall live.</HI> God having taken your Children into a Covenant of life, if they never break
<PB N="28" REF="000393_0033_0FA5A8252BA52438">
that Covenant, shall they not live for ever? yea, they shall live for ever,</P>
<P N="2">2. Parents should be careful what opinions they imbrace, for oftentimes the poison of a corrupt Opinion in the Father proveth bane|ful to the child; as <HI>Naaman</HI>'s Leprosie went down from Generation to Generation; so the plague of spiritual Leprosie in the Head. is sometimes propagated from the Father to the Son.</P>
<P N="3">3. Parents should be careful of their Con|versation; because their Children are apt to follow their example, especially in that which is evil. As it's noted of Ahaziah, that he wal|ked in the way of his father and of his mother 1. King. 22.52. And of those superstitious persons 2. <HI>King.</HI> 17.41. <HI>They served their gra|ven Images, both their Children and their childrens childrens; as did their Fathers, so doe they to this day.</HI> If the Father follow superstitious or pro|fane practices, it is most likely that the child|ren will do so too. Therefore you that are parents, in the fear of God look to it that you do not scandalize your children by an evil ex|ample: If your Children see you in drink sometimes, will they not be Drunkards too? If they hear you swear, will not they swear also? If they see you carless in the observa|tion of the Sabbath, will they not likewise be guilty of Sabbath-breaking? And if they
<PB N="29" REF="000393_0034_0FA5A826A85DE878">
see you live in the neglect of holy duties, no Prayer in the Family, how shall they be seek|ers of God? It will be a wonder if such Child|ren do not prove Atheists, that are brought up in Families where they never see any pray|er or acknowledgement of God. O think with your selves, if you that are Parents should any of you perish, and your miserable Child|ren should follow you to Hell, how will they curse you there? If thy Children perish throw thy evil Example, they will follow thee up and down in the ever-burning Lake crying out <NOTE N="[e]" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Mr. Bolton of Walking with God. p.</HI> 249&punc;</NOTE> Woe to us that ever we were born of such Parents that had no grace to teach us the wayes of God, and lead us in the pathes of Godliness! If you that were our parents had discharged your duty towards us, we might have been in the JOYES OF HEAVEN, but now our damned souls must live for ever in these everlasting flames; Thus wilt thou hear thine own Children yelling in thine Ears, world without end. Canst thou think of this and thy heart not break? then thy heart is an Adamant, and thy heart strings made of Iron sinews.</P>
<P>USE. 4. Of Exhortation.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let godly Parents that are here before
<PB N="30" REF="000393_0035_0FA5A828CC1A05C0">
the Lord this day, suffer the word of Exhor|tation, <HI>Do you endeavour to the utmost of your power, that your Children may become seekers and servants of the only true God in Jesus Christ.</HI> And indeed when you present them to the Lord in Baptism, you promise to do your ut|most that they may become faithful servants of that God who is Father, Son, and Spirit; take heed that you do not become guilty of vi|olating that engagement. God hath com|mitted children unto you, that so you might bring them up for him, <HI>The children which thou hast born unto me,</HI> Ezek. 16.20. If a man had the Children of a Prince or great man com|mitted to his Care and Charge for Education, would he not be careful about that matter? It is a solemn thing, which it may be you have not duly considered, that the great God has entrusted you with those that are his Children that so you may nurse them up for him: O then bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord. It is not enough for Parents to serve the Lord themselves, but they must use utmost endeavours that after they are dead, their children may walk in the waves of God. And if they be duly careful in that matter, they have reason to expect that God will remember &amp; establish his Cove|nant with their Children. For is it noted concerning Abraham, that his care was that his Family <HI>after him,</HI> (viz. after he should
<PB N="31" REF="000393_0036_0FA5A82913BB48E8">
cease to be in the world) <HI>might keep the way of the Lord,</HI> and so did the Lord bring upon him the thing which he had spoken and graciously promised with respect to Abrahams posterity. And in special you that are mothers have a great advantage put into your hands to be in|stilling <NOTE N="[f]" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Mr. Firmin's Real Christian. pag.</HI> 8.</NOTE> good principles into your child|rens souls betimes. Solomon's mother taught him: We do not read that Absalom's and Adonijah's mother taught them, as Bathsheba did her son Solomon. And it is not for no|thing, that when children have proved thus or so, particular notice is taken in Scripture, that such or such were their mothers: Reho|boam did not prove well, and it is noted that his mother was an Ammonitess. On the o|ther hand, Hezekiah, Jehoshaphat, Josiah were eminent Servants of God, and the Scripture does mention who were their mothers. O then you that are mothers should endeavour that your children (as <HI>Luther</HI> speaketh) may suck in Religion from their mothers Breasts.</P>
<P>And let all godly parents <HI>earnestly seek unto the Lord for their poor children.</HI> You ought to doe so dayly and particularly, and by name before the Lord, and thus should you doe eve|ry day: As we read concerning <HI>Job,</HI> that he off|ered burnt Offerings for his children <HI>according
<PB N="32" REF="000393_0037_0FA5A829AB7EB460">
to the</HI> number <HI>of them all, thus did Job continu|ally.</HI> Chapt 1.5. Remember that you are un|der peculiar encouragement so to doe: if the Children of godly Parents have special encour|agement to seek the Lord, then the same thing must needs be true concerning Parents them|selves, with respect to their children: And it is eminently true with respect to the Children of <HI>New-England,</HI> inasmuch as they are the posterity of such as have been sufferers on the account of the Name and Truth of the Lord Jesus. Are not such Parents pronounced bless|ed twice over? <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.11, 12. even bless|ed in themselves, and in their posterity?

Plead it with the Lord; if you that be godly Parents lay up a stock of prayers for your children, it may stand them in more stead than if you should leave them never such an Inheritance as to the things of the world; when you are dead your prayers shall live. There is many a Child whose Father and Mo|ther is now in Heaven, that fareth the better and will do so for ever, on the account of prayers made for him by his blessed Parents while they were in this world.

<P>Say not, Oh! but I have prayed, and yet see no answer to my prayers! well! but con|tinue seeking the Lord still, dispair not of a good answer at last. That famous Mr. <HI>Ro|gers</HI> of <HI>Dedham</HI> would sometimes say, <HI>If I see a Child that hath either a godly father or a godly mother, I shall have hope for him a long time, but if he hath a godly father and mother too, I'le ne|ver leave hoping for him until I see him turn'd off the Gallows.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Let me direct my Exhortation to the Children of godly parents: There are many such that hear me this day:</P>
<P>Be you exhorted to know, and serve, and seek the God of your Fathers.</P>
<P>Consider therefore,</P>

the God of thy Father saith David. <HI>Prov.</HI> 27&punc; 10. <HI>Forsake not thy fathers friend.</HI> And wilt thou forsake thy Fathers <HI>God,</HI> who is the best friend that ever thy Father had? Children are loth to part with other things, because they were their Fathers; As Naboth said concerning his Vineyard, <HI>God forbid that I should part with the Inheritance of my</HI> Father, 1. <HI>King.</HI> 21.3.

<P>Consider. 2. <HI>The Good and Benefit that will follow upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> seeking to the Lord.</HI> If there were nothing more to be said but only this, it should be a prevailing Motive, <HI>viz.</HI> That then your Parents will have Joy in you; <HI>A wise son</HI> (i. e. a godly son) <HI>maketh a glad father.</HI> The Apostle John hath such an ex|pression as this <HI>I have no greater joy than to hear that my Children walk in the truth,</HI> 3.

O think of it you that (though the Chil|dren of godly Parents) have bin hainous sinners before the Lord, seek him sincerely, &amp; he will pardon all your sins &amp; save your souls form eter|nal death.

<P><PB N="36" REF="000393_0041_0FA5A831F4941D10">How much more will the blessed God pardon you and accept you into his favour, all your Rebellions notwithstanding, if indeed you sincerely seek unto him! Yea, and God will bless you when your parents shall be taken from you, he will then be a Father to you, Psal. 27.10. <HI>When my father and my mother forsake me, the Lord will take me up.</HI> viz. as a tender-hearted Father takes his child up into his armes and beareth him in his bosome.

O thy soul, thy soul must lie weltring in a fiery Ocean, as long as the Eternal God shall have any Being! Can thy heart endure to think of this? No, O then seek the Lord while he may be found, Call upon him while he is near.</P>
<P>Something let me speak by way of Direction: briefly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Be thankful to the Lord in that he hath given you to be born of godly parents</HI>: in that you
<PB N="42" REF="000393_0047_0FA5A8366E7C6400">
have bin (as David speaketh) cast upon the Lord from the <HI>womb,</HI> &amp; he hath been your God from your mothers belly, <HI>Psal.</HI> 22.10. You might have been born of such Parents as would have nursed you up in ignorance, Profaness or Idolatry, and so your souls have been under a necessity of perishing for ever; but the Lord hath given you to be born of parents that have designed you for God, and for his Glory. Yea it was for your sakes especially, that your Fa|thers ventured their lives upon the rude waves of the vast Ocean. Was it not with respect unto Posterity that our Fathers came into this Wilderness, that they might train up a Ge|neration for Christ? Bless God that ever you had such Fathers.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Plead the Lord's gracious Covenant with him,</HI> He is very willing that you should do so: <HI>Ask me concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me,</HI> Isai. 45.11. You say you cannot give grace to your own souls: True, But hath not the Lord in the Cove|nant of Grace said <HI>I will give you a new heart</HI> Ezek. 36.26. Plead that promise, you espe|cially that have had the Covenant sealed to you; why should you let your Baptism lye by you as if it were of no use? Go to God in se|cret, and say, Lord thou hast promised to give a new heart to the Children of thy ser|vants, and thy Covenant hath been sealed
<PB N="43" REF="000393_0048_0FA5A8384A1FC430">
to me in my Baptism, Oh give me a new Heart.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Do not rest in any thing that is external:</HI> Not in your relation to godly parents, and vi|sible relation to God on that account; it is not your parents seeking unto God will save you, except you seek Him your selves also. Did not the Lord say to the children of Israel, <HI>Are ye not as the Children of Aethiopians unto me?</HI> Amos. 9.7. They vainly trusted that no Destruction should ever come upon them be|cause they were descended from blessed An|cestors: You may be as far from eternal sal|vation as the Children of Ethiopians for all that, if you do not serve the God of your Fa|thers. Therefore John Baptist said, <HI>Think not to say, We have Abraham to our father,</HI> Mat. 3.9. I have known some that have been so foolish as to think they should be saved, only because they were the Children of godly pa|rents, tho&punc; they lived in the neglect of God, and of their own souls. Beware of so perver|ting the Truth delivered unto you: And rest not in being outwardly civil and blameless; was not Paul so before his conversion, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.6. And they that have been advantaged with a religious Education oftentimes are so, tho' never truly converted. Beware also of taking up a <HI>form</HI> of Godliness without the <HI>power</HI> of it. O You that are the Children of godly Parents, if you outwardly observe the Sabbath day, and
<PB N="44" REF="000393_0049_0FA5A838ABE35618">
pray in secret, and read the Scriptures, (all which things I charge you in the Name of the Lord, that you attend unto them whilst you live) you will be apt to rest here, without an Interest in the glorious Righteousness of the Son of God; but for the love of your immor|tal souls&punc; I beseech you, deceive not your selves; build not upon a false foundation, look to it in the fear of God that your hearts be perfect before him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Never leave seeking God until you find him.</HI> Seek, &amp; seek, &amp; seek again, until you know that you have obtained a saving interest in Jesus Christ, and in the favour of God through him. O make thorough-work of it in the matter of your Conversion; be not <HI>almost</HI> but <HI>altogether</HI> Christians, so shall you find that the blessing of all the Prayers, and Covenant of your graci|ous Parents will come upon you for evermore.</P>

<P>THe Title-Page prefixed to this Discourse, in|timateth the Time and Occasion of its delive|ry. I had no cause to (nor did I) expect that it would fall to my Lot to speak, before the Choice was made; if I had I would have used means to prevent that trouble from coming upon my self or <HI>others.</HI> But it may be God did it to prove me and see whether I would please men or Christ. And I hope I may (in some measure) say after the Apostle, <HI>We are bold in our God to speak. Our Exhortation was not of Deceit, but even so we speak not as pleasing</HI> men <HI>but</HI> God, <HI>which tryeth our hearts.

(And to avoid more controver|sal discourses) There is indeed one particular in|sisted on, which is now become a matter of Scruple

I may better speak in this cause than some others, as having my self had experience what it is to have Conscience imposed on, and therefore would be loth that any truly conscientious should be burdened; and it is sufficiently known that I have a greater latitude and <HI>Indulgence</HI> in the point of <HI>Toleration,</HI> than many better than my self have. Nevertheless I judge it most unreasona|ble that <HI>pretended Liberty of Conscience</HI> should be an <HI>Asylum</HI> for the profanest errors to take Sanctuary in: As though men must therefore have Liberty to profane <HI>Sabbaths</HI> or <HI>Sacraments,</HI> or set up an <HI>Altar</HI> against the Lord's <HI>Altar</HI>&punc; and their <HI>Threshold</HI> by his <HI>Threshold,</HI> &amp; their <HI>Posts</HI> by his <HI>Posts,</HI> when and where they please: It cannot be but the <HI>Lord</HI> will be provoked at such things, espe|cially in <HI>New-England</HI> where men are not under such temptations to forsake their <HI>Assembling</HI> them|selves together, as in some other places: And where <HI>Zeal</HI> on the other hand hath been notorious, so that such <HI>Lukewarmness</HI> will in a People cir|cumstanced as we are, be an evidence of <HI>Apost|acy.</HI></P>

<P>But if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS there is a peculiar Excellency in all the Books of Scripture, becoming the Majesty of their Author; so it is in special manner true with respect unto this Sa|cred Book of <HI>Chronicles</HI>: which is <NOTE N="[a]" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the English &amp; Dutch Annot.</HI></NOTE> not the same with those Chronicles we sometimes read of in the <HI>King's,</HI> those being civil Records, but these wholly of a divine Inspiration, con|taining the History of no less than three Thou|sand &amp; five Hundred years; even from the first man Adam unto the Jews Return from the Babylonish Captivity, and many years after that also. The Hebrews suppose it (or at least some part of it) to be the last Book of Scripture that was written, and therefore they are wont to place it last in their Bibles, as the concluding Book of the Old Testament. The Greeks entitle it [<HI>ton paraleipomenon</HI>] Because diverse things most worthy of eternal Com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">moration are related in these books, which
<PB N="52" REF="000393_0055_0FA5A83FC5B49DF8">
are no where else to be found. So in this Chapter we have Davids Solemn Dying Ex|hortation: words which deserve to be record|ed, and yet are no where else seen (at least wise not in that ample mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">) but in this Chapter. And it was in a very solemn As|sembly that these words were spoken, indeed in a <HI>General Assembly,</HI> when all the Lords peo|ple both as to Civil and Ecclesiastical order were come together for the Establishment of another Ruler amongst them; accordingly David doth here direct his Exhortation, first to the representatives of the people, <HI>ver.</HI> 1. <HI>And David assembled all the Princes of Israel, the Princes of the Tribes, and the Captains of the Companies unto themselves &amp;c.</HI> Hence they are said to be all Israel, <HI>ver.</HI> 8. <HI>in the sight of all Israel h. e.</HI> the Heads and Representatives of all Israel, and therefore are said to be <HI>the Con|gregation of the Lord.</HI> Often in Scripture by the <HI>Congregation,</HI> the Heads and Rulers of the Congregations are meant. Now the Exhorta|tion unto them is that they would <HI>keep and seek all the Commandments of the Lord,</HI> h. e. that they would observe what they did know, and se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k to know more of the mind of God. The motive whereby he urgeth this is, because the Lord had promised the good Land to them; but it was upon that condition of their keep|ing his Commandments, therefore it did highly concern them to be careful in that matter.

2<HI>dly,</HI> he directs his Exhortation to him that was to be estabished as chief Ruler, <HI>scil.</HI> to his son Solomon, whom God appointed to succeed his Father in the Government: Now Sinceri|ty was the main thing which David his Father did exhort him unto, in the beginning of this verse, <HI>And thou Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy Father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind.</HI> This is further urged from three motives,</P>
<P N="1">1. From the Consideration of the divine Omnisciency, <HI>For the Lord searcheth the hearts &amp; understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. From the benefit and good which would follow upon seeking to the Lord, <HI>if thou seek him he will be found of thee.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. From the evil that is in forsaking him; In the words now before us; which though they were spoken to Solomon, yet were they of equal Concernment unto others, being cir|cumstanced as he was, <HI>h. e.</HI> that were of the younger succeeding generation, being also the Children and posterity of godly Parents. Es|pecially the words did and do concern those that are the <HI>Posterity of David,</HI> that is to say, of those that have bin eminent Servants of God in their Generation. The Doctrine which I would therefore (by the help of Christ) in|sist on as Conceiving that it may not be altoge|ther unsutable for this great Audience, is this,</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="000393_0057_0FA5A841DCDD3C88">Doct. <HI>That if they who are the Children and Posterity of God's eminent Servants shall forsake the Lord, he will cast them of for ever.</HI></P>
<P>In the doctrinal handling of this Truth, there are four things which may be briefly enquired into. 1. When men, especially the Children of Gods servants, may be said to forsake him. 2. What is implyed in this casting off for ever? 3. What forsaking of God that is, which will be attended with such Casting off. 4. The Reason of this dreadful Procedure of the Most High towards the Posterity of His Peo|ple.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>When may men be said to forsake the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>When they depart from the blessed Truths of God,</HI> then <HI>they may be said to forsake him.</HI> Hence the Apostle chargeth it upon the apostatizing Galatians that they were <HI>removed from him that called them</HI> Chap. 1.6. <HI>h. e.</HI> they had forsaken God himself, because they had corrupted and forsaken the great Truths of the Gospel. All Truth is from God, there|fore he is styled <HI>the God of Truth,</HI> Did. 32.4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>Truth, it self,</HI> 1. Joh. 5.6. And Truth is said to be his Name. Christ said to his faith|ful ones in the Church of Pergamus, <HI>thou hold|est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">st my Name.</HI> Rev. 2.13. The Truths of Christ were much opposed by the Infidels,
<PB N="55" REF="000393_0058_0FA5A8429D6B5F40">
and by the Hereticks of those dayes, only some did faithfully adhere thereunto; and these are said to hold fast his Name. so then to forsake the Truth, is to forsake the Lord's Name. Especially when there is Apostacy from great foundation-Truths in Religion, the Lord is forsaken. Albeit every truth hath the Name of God stamped upon it, yet there are some Truths which have more of his Name on them than others have, that the disowning of them is absolutely to reject the Lord, namely Fund|amental Truths, which indeed are not many nor hard to be known. Moreover when those Truths are disowned by children, which their Fathers were eminently engaged in the profes|sion of, (tho' they should not be fundamental as in their natures) such Children may be said to forsake the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When men Deifie any other Object besides the Lord.</HI> They that set up other things in God's stead, in their so doing forsake the Lord; so it is when men give religious worship to any other besides him, who <HI>alone</HI> ought to be feared.

<P>Answ. 1. <HI>It Implyeth a Change as to divine Dispensations.</HI> In the Scripture, when the Lord threatned to cast off his people, that is intend|ed <HI>viz.</HI> that he would make an alteration as to the tenour of his Dispensations towards them: here it is set in opposition to <HI>finding God,</HI> if thou seek him, he will be <HI>found</HI> of thee, but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off: Now <HI>finding</HI> God doth Imply the enjoyment of his favour, and therefore in <HI>casting off</HI> is implyed the Deprivement of the Lords favourable pre|sence.

<P>We come in the next place to enquire</P>
<P><HI>What Forsaking of God is that, that will be attended with this Casting off?</HI></P>
<P>Answ.

G. Idolatry</HI> is a sin that causeth the Rejection
<PB N="67" REF="000393_0070_0FA5A84E6D1828B0">
which the text speaks of. Yea, it is true with reference unto that Idolatry which is against the Second Commandement: When the Children of Israel committed that Idolatry re|specting the Calf in the Wilderness, they sin|ned against the Second Commandment, for they would worship the Lord still, only they would do it in such a way and by such meanes as God never appointed, and they were in great danger of being cast off for this sin. Hence the Lord said to Moses, <HI>Thy People have corrupted them selves,</HI> Exodus 32.7. The Lord doth not say <HI>my</HI> people as he was wont to do, but <HI>thy</HI> people, as if it were said; Now they have violated my Covenant, and deserve that I should for ever disown and reject them. The Asian Churches have been cast off for this sin especially; we may read the sin of those Churches written in dreadful Characters, up|on the Forehead of that Judgment that hath destroy'd them all: God has let loose the bar|barous Turks upon them, who hate and de|stroy no men so much as those that worship Images. And as for the Church of Rome, the Apostle Paul did solemnly predict that they should be cast off <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.22. Now it is for this sin principally that the Lord hath cast them off.

<P>QUST. <HI>But why so?</HI></P>
<P><HI>ANSW.</HI> For such Reasons as these.</P>
<P><HI>REAS.</HI> 1. Because the Transgressions of such Children as the Doctrine speaks of are
<PB N="71" REF="000393_0074_0FA5A8516B3A3538">
peculiar provocations; if the children of <HI>Da|vid</HI> sin, their Iniquity is attended with special aggravations: They sin against greater light, and love, and grace, than may be said of any persons in the world besides: They that re|bell against the light, do at last provoke the Lord utterly to reject them. Hence it is that refusing Instruction, is mentioned as the grand procuring Cause of this Rejection, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6.8. <HI>Be instructed O Jerusalem lest my soul depart from thee, and thou become desolate.</HI> Now thus it is when the Children of Godly parents for|sake the Lord, as Solomon doth acknowledge, how diligent and faithful his blessed Father had bin in instructing of him, <HI>Pro.</HI> 4.3, 4. <HI>I was my Father's son, he</HI> taught <HI>me also, and said un|to me keep my Commandments and live.</HI> And sins against grace and peculiar mercy do without Repentance end in everlasting Rejection, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.2. <HI>You only have I known &mdash; therefore will I punish you for all your Iniquities.</HI> Who ever es|cape (saith the Lord) to be sure you shall not, because you sin against greater grace and fa|vour than any others in the world ever did. For these causes the Lord threatned Eli that he would cut off his Arm, and the Arm of his Fathers house, inasmuch as he had sinned a|gainst peculiar mercies and favours. Especial|ly, sins against Tenders of Gospel-grace pro|voke the Lord to <HI>cast</HI> men <HI>off,</HI> Mat. 23.37, 38. <HI>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have
<PB N="72" REF="000393_0075_0FA5A852D547A1C0">
gathered you, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens un|der her wings but ye would not, and now your house is left unto you desolate.</HI> And this is sadly true concerning the children of godly parents, they sin against special favours from the Lord, the means of grace is vouchsafed to them, they have many blessed strivings of the Holy spirit with them which others have not, therefore if they forsake the Lord, no wonder if he cast them off for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. Because such Children are guilty of lamentable Covenant-breaking before the Lord for the Covenant is with Children as well as parents, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.10, 11, 12. <HI>You and your</HI> little ones <HI>doe enter into Covenant.</HI> Upon this account David saith that the Lord was his God from his <HI>Infancy,</HI> yea, from his first com|ing into the world, <HI>Psal.</HI> 22.10. And the like is noted concerning Solomon, and therefore his Father said to him, <HI>My son build the house of the Lord thy God</HI> 1. Chron. 22.11. The Lord is not only <HI>my</HI> God, but in respect of his gracious Covenant he is <HI>thy</HI> God also. And this seems to be the reason why Abraham is styled the Father of the Faithful. <NOTE N="[g]" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Mr. Carter Abraham's Cove|nant opened.</HI></NOTE> Not meerly on the Account of the eminency of his faith, for we read of others in Scripture whose faith was not inferior to his, but in that he was the

first unto whom God expresly declared, <HI>I will be a God to thee and to thy seed,</HI> and withal ap|pointed a sacred sign and fear of this Covenant. Now Abraham's Covenant is as to the sub|stance of it <HI>Everlasting</HI>: And therefore the Children of the faithful in all Ages, are wrap|ped under the Bond of the Covenant, other|wise there would be a substantial Change of the Covenant from what it was at first, than which nothing can be more contradictory to the whole tenor and current of the Scripture. The Apostle therefore testifies <HI>that the blessing of Abraham is come on the Gentiles, through Je|sus Christ,</HI> Gal. 3.14. As God said unto Abra|ham, I take thee &amp; thy children into Covenant with my self, so does He through Jesus Christ say the like to every believing Parent among the Gentiles: And therefore the Lord Jesus did did affirm concerning Children, <HI>of such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the kingdom of Heaven,</HI> Mat. 19.14. <NOTE N="[h]" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Burroughs on Matth.</HI> 5.3. <HI>pag.</HI> 61.</NOTE> It is not only true (saith Christ) that Children did belong to God under the Old Testament, but now, that <HI>the Kingdom of heaven is at hand,</HI> now that the Church is to be under the Heavenly Dispensation of the Gospel, Children must be acknowledged there also. And it is for ever to be observed, that when the New Testament dispensation was ready to be establish'd, the Ancient Grant concerning Childrens interest
<PB N="74" REF="000393_0077_0FA5A854F0172C28">
in the Covenant is expresly confirmed, <HI>Act.</HI> 2.39. <HI>The Promise is to you and to your Children.</HI> Hence then, if such Children do forsake the Lord, they are guilty of violating the Cove|nant. Now that's an Iniquity which does provoke the Lord to <HI>cast off</HI> those that are deep|ly guilty of it, <HI>Isai.</HI> 24.5, 6. <HI>They have broken the everlasting Covenant, therefore they are cursed, burned, desolute.</HI> In old time it was the man|ner when a Covenant was made, some creature or other was killed, and cut in peices, by which Rite was signified, that the Lord would kill and cut off him, that being in Covenant with God, did not make conscience faithfully to keep and observe that Covenant inviolable for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 3. From that infinite Indignation which is in the Lord's Heart against Apostates. They are Fugitives from Christ, and diserting their Captain the <HI>Lord</HI> himself will execute Martial law upon them: No sinners are great|er objects of Divine hatred and indignation. Hence the Apostle said to the Hebrews, when some of them were ready to apostatize from Christianity to Judaism, <HI>If any man draw back the soul of God shall take no pleasure in him.</HI> Heb. 10.38. meaning that such creatures are ves|sels of dishonour, and the most loathsome Ob|jects that can be thought of. Hence the Lord doth pursue them with infinite vengeance, he cuts them off and casts them off for ever. As
<PB N="75" REF="000393_0078_0FA5A85732C1BE70">
that miserable <HI>Spira</HI> at the very moment, when he had renounced the Truth, thought he heard one say to him, <HI>Hence thou Apostate, and receive the Sentence of thy eternal Damnation.</HI> The Lord is wont to leave marks of his wrath upon such sinners. He brands them that all, the world may be afraid of that Iniquity: Sel|dome has it been known that any have noto|riously turned away from the Lord, but visible wrath from heaven has fallen upon them. <HI>Je|horam</HI> had been religiously educated under his godly Father <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> but he proved the Apostate Child of a Gracious Father; and what came on him? God let loose the Hea|then Arabians, who wasted his estate and mur|dered all his children save one: Thus did the Lord <HI>cast</HI> him <HI>off&punc; Joash</HI> was religiously edu|cated under his uncle <HI>Jehosada<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> but he forsook the Lord, therefore the Assyrians with a small Army destroyed a great Hos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> his own treacherous servants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> him. The like we read concerning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. And Histories (besides what is recorded in Scripture) are full of awful and amazing Ex|amples of the Lords indignation against Apos|tates, and therefore since if Davids Children do forsake the Lord, they are to be reckoned among the number of Apostates, no wonder that He doth threaten to Cast them off for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="000393_0079_0FA5A85791C46E70">We proceed now to a word of Aplication, and shall insist upon one only</P>
<P>Use of Exhortation.</P>
<P><HI>Let us be exhorted in the Name and Fear of God this day, to endeavour that it may not be with us as the Text and Doctrine expresseth</HI>; let us e|very one in our several places and Capassities endeavour that the present and succeeding Ge|nerations in New-England, may not forsake the Lord God of their Fathers, and so endan|ger their being cast off for ever.</P>
<P>Wherefore Consider. 1. <HI>What Fathers and Predecessours have been,</HI> they were such as did seek the Lord. As for the body of the pre|sent Generation in New-England, It may be said to them, your Fathers were such as did serve the Lord: yea, it was love to God and to Jesus Christ which brought them into this Widerness as the Lord speaks <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.2. <HI>I re|member the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine Espousals, when thou wentest after me in the Wil|derness, in a Land which was not sown.</HI> Our Fathers did not in their coming hither pro|pound any great matter to themselves respect|ing this world; only that they should have liberty to serve God, and to walk with him in all the wayes of his Worship. As one of our Worthies has aptly expressed, God sifted three Nations, that so he might bring over choice Grain into this Wilderness. Let us then re|member what New-England hath been: It

hath been a noble Plant, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.21. <HI>J plant|ted thee a noble Vine, wholly a right seed.</HI> It hath been Cedar, our eyes have seen the Lord ful|filling that Scripture litterally and gloriously, Isai. 41 19. <HI>I will plant in the wilderness a Cedar.</HI> The chief of the Fathers in these New-English Churches they were <HI>Abrahams:</HI> He, when God called him removed out of <HI>Vr of the Chaldees</HI> to the place which the Lord would shew him, &amp; there built an Altar to the everlasting God; so did our Fathers remove out of their own land when God called them, and came hither to build an Altar here to the Everlasting God, yea, and they have set the Altar upon its right Basis too. Our Fathers have been <HI>Davids,</HI> that is to say, <HI>eminent Reformers.</HI> Let me speak freely (without offence to any) there never was a generation that did so perfectly shake off the dust of Babylon, both as to Ecclesiastical and Civil Constitution, as the first Generation of Christians that came into this Land for the Gospels sake. Where was there ever a place so like unto New Jerusalem as New-England hath been? It was once Dr. <HI>Twiss</HI> his Opini|on <NOTE N="[i]" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Dr. Twiss's Letters printed in Mr. Medes works.

Truly that such a Type and Em|bleme of New Jerusalem, should be erected in
<PB N="78" REF="000393_0081_0FA5A858F199E810">
so dark a corner of the world, is matter of deep Meditation and Admiration.</P>
<P>Consider, 2. <HI>How subject men are, yea the Children of blessed parents and Predecessours, to a|postatize from God.</HI> It is possible that the Chil|dren of <HI>David</HI> may forsake the Lord, and that in a short time too: when Predecessors have been eminent for God, their Successours have been most degenerate, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.21. <HI>I planted thee wholly a right seed&punc; how art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me!</HI> Isai. 1.21. <HI>How is the faithful City become an Harlot! it</HI> was <HI>full of Judgement, Righteousness lodged in it, but now murderers.</HI> It was some|times said unto good Samuel, <HI>Thy sons walk not in thy waies.</HI> And it is noted Concerning <HI>Na|bal</HI> (a drunken Sot) that he was of the house of <HI>Caleb,</HI> 1. Sam. 25.3. That ever such a branch should spring out of such a stock! The Ephraimites were the vilest Idolaters of all the apostate Children of Israel, yet they were the posterity of Joseph, the best of Jacobs twelve sons. The Perfidious and ingrateful Ziphites were also the posterity of that blessed <HI>Caleb</HI> but now mentioned. Yea, it is a sad Truth that Religion has seldome been upheld in the power of it, for above one or two Ge|nerations together. Therefore it is recorded concerning the Children of Israel, <HI>they turned</HI> quickly <HI>out of the way which their Fathers walked in, obeying the Commandments of the Lord, but
<PB N="79" REF="000393_0082_0FA5A859B7600E50">
they did not so,</HI> Judges 2.17. The Fathers and Leaders both of the first and second Generati|on were for purity of worship, but their chil|dren were <HI>not so.</HI> Their Fathers did endea|vour to uphold Religion in the Power of it, but <HI>their children did not so.</HI> Their Fathers did order their Conversations according to the holy Rules of the word of God, but <HI>their chil|dren did not so.</HI> Hence is that sad Complaint by the Prophet, <HI>they rose early and corrupted all their doings,</HI> Zeph. 3.7. And if we look into the Scripture and view the Story of former A|ges, we shall see this to be true. The poste|rity of the Lords Servants, the Children of the Church have in a little time so forsaken him, as that solemn Reformation has been necessary: Look beyond the Flood and we shall see it so. One of Adam's children with all his numerous posterity forsook the Lord: Cain was Excommunicate out of the Church and became the Father of an Excommunicate Race and Generation. The first Church that ever was in the world, even that in Adam's Family continued in some measure pure, about the space of <NOTE N="[k]" PLACE="foot"><HI>Owen de Theol. Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 2.</NOTE> an Hundred and thirty years, (<HI>h. e.</HI> until Seth was born) but then great A|postacy prevailed. When the Church was small in one Family it was more easie to keep it pure, by casting out the Apostates, but now
<PB N="80" REF="000393_0083_0FA5A85A7659B240">

Hence is that <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.26. <HI>then began men to call upon the Name of the Lord.</HI> It noteth a Separation of the Church from the profane world.

When that iniquity first began is hard to say, but it is evident that in Jobs time (who is thought to live about three hundred and fifty years after the flood) the world was filled with Idolaters, yea, in <HI>Abra|ham's</HI> time there was such Apostacy as that Religion was almost gone out of the world, only in his Family there was a pure Church Established: Yet his posterity did quickly for|sake the Lord. The <HI>Ishmaelites, Midianites, Edomites,</HI> (and other Nations) who were of the Posterity of Abraham the Father of the faithful, in a few generations lost the <HI>Substan|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ials</HI> of Religion, and were wholly deprived of their Church estate.

they were faithful to my Name, and did acquit themselves as became them, now let me see what you will doe: Follow them as they fol|lowed Christ. Give me leave to mention two or three words, which if the Lord help us to Remember them, we shall serve our Generation according to the will of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us approve our selves faithful in what Concerns the House of God.</HI> And therefore we ought to be Careful who are admitted there&punc; tho' others are also concerned there|in, yet in a more peculiar manner <HI>that matter belongs to us.</HI> We are in (respect of sacred Of|fice relation before the Lord) <HI>Porters</HI> that have the Charge of his House; and we are solemn|ly charged, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 44. (it is a Scripture that concerns Ministers of the New Testament) not to bring into the Lords Sanctuary uncir|cumcised in heart to be in the Sanctuary to pollute it, and to eat the Bread of God there. Indeed as for those whom God hath admitted into his House (in any degree) by any Rule of his, we must not turn them out till the Lord doe it. But that which I intend is the Admissi|on of persons into full Communion, we know what our Fathers have Taught concerning that matter, <HI>viz.</HI> that there ought to be an Hold|ing forth Faith and Repentance before Admis|sion to the Lords Table and it is well said by

The <NOTE N="[k]" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr. Owen de Theol. l.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 8. <HI>p.</HI> 504.</NOTE> neglect of this Principle of Truth, that such Members of the Church as are admitted to full Communion, ought to be Regenerate Converted Persons, the Non-attendance unto that did (as a wor|thy, Divine of our own hath well noted) lay a Foundation to great Apostasie, which the Christian Church hath been long subject unto. Again, if we would be faithful as to what con|cerns the House of God, we must endeavour that the Building thereof be carried on to Per|fection. As David in this Context speaks to So|lomon, <HI>Take heed now for the Lord has chosen thee to build an house for a Sanctuary, be strong and doe it.</HI> So has the Lord been pleas'd to chuse

I know that where there is but one Elder in a Church (as alas that is now the case of these Churches ge|nerally) so much cannot be done that way as is to be desired; yet if we doe as much as we can, the Lord Jesus will accept of it, and it may be, success will be beyond expectation. Many an one that minds not a Sermon, yet when he is by a Messenger of God particularly spoken to, and told, you are yet in your sins; if you be not <HI>new</HI> born, better you had <HI>never</HI> been born; he falls down under Conviction. And possibly words that we little think any such thing of now, will be mentioned again to our exceeding joy and rejoycing in the day of Christ, when we shall see and hear many souls stand forth and bless the Lord Jesus that ever they knew us, and that ever we spake to them in the Name of the Lord both publickly

Such a publick Spirit well becomes our publick Capacity, and therefore upon all occasions to speak and act accordingly.

<P>If the Lord help us to approve our selves faithful unto the Death, when he the chief Shepherd shal appear, he will give unto us a Crown of Glory which fadeth not away.</P>

<P>Moreover, there are many others of the people of the Land here, before the Lord this day, a considerable part of the present Gene|ration is met together in this great Assembly; A few words let me speak to you. and leave with you, that so you may not forsake the Lord, the God of your Fathers.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us labour to be rightly informed respect|ing Princi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">les which our Fathers owned.</HI> There are Mistakes in the minds of some who think that the Fathers of this Colony, affirmed thus and so, albeit it was far from them so to teach, or so to think. I shall not (being now in earnest, and desirous to speak with utmost So|lemnity) enter upon things which are more Controversal amongst us, but certain it is, that our Fathers alwaies owned and avowed
<PB N="125" REF="000393_0128_0FA5A87F318F7060">
this principle of Truth, <HI>That nothing should be admitted into the Worship of God but what there is Scripture Warrant for, nor any thing neglected which the Lord hath Instituted.</HI> The Cause of the Second Commandment was that which our Fathers were engaged in the Defence of. And as to Church Administrations, <HI>That things should be reduced to the Primitive, Apostolical pattern.</HI> An excellent principle, albeit, that blessed Martyr <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Clark's Lives, pag.</HI> 493.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Laurence Saunders</HI> was accused of Heresie for asserting it. And I re|member that learned man and blessed Martyr <HI>Peter Ramus</HI> professeth in one of his Epistles that the deep consideration of this principle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>vide Petri Rami Epist. ad Cardinal.

Remember blessed Mr. <HI>Nor|ton</HI>'s last words in this place, and under this Roof.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="126" REF="000393_0129_0FA5A87FEB6ADE40">2. <HI>Keep up the power of Discipline in Church|es.</HI> When Apostasie prevailed in the Asiatick Churches, <HI>there</HI> was the original wound, they did not brandish the Sword of Discipline, which is Christs own Expedient, and appoint|ment for the preservation of Churches in pu|rity; yea, this was a fatal Neglect, which by degrees proved ruinous to those once fam|ous and glorious Churches. Some learned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voetius alicubi inter Disputationes.</HI></NOTE> men have well observed, that the Neglect of Discipline in the Churches of Asia brought in corruption of manners, and Corruption of Manners was (through the just revenging hand of God) attended with Corruption of Doctrine, and these together provoked the Lord to lay those Churches most desolate. And as for the Children of the Covenant, let Discipline be extended towards them, accord|ing as they are subjects capable thereof. Did not our Fathers come hither in hope that they should leave their children under the Dis|cipline and Government of the Lord Jesus in his Church?

<P N="3">3. <HI>Look to your Families.</HI> Families are the Nurseries for Church and Common-Wealth, ruine Families and ruine all. Order them well &amp; the Publick State will fare the better. The great wound &amp; misery of <HI>New-England</HI> is that Families <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Read Mr. Stockton of Family Instruction.</HI></NOTE> are out of order. As t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the gene|rality of House-holders, Family-Government is lost and gone; Servants do not fear their Masters, children do not honour their Parents, in that respect the English are become like unto the <HI>Indians.</HI> Let Christians make conscience of it as their Duty, to rule their own Houses well, and be careful that Family Instruction be upheld; the Judgement of God should awa|ken to this. In some Families the Children have no Father left to instruct them, in other Families Fathers have no Children left, to be instructed by them; by these terrible Judge|ments they that have Families should learn to be diligent in Instructing of them, whilst they have an opportunity so to doe: And this is the way to prevent Apostasie: For Ignorance is the Mother (not of Devotion but) of HERESY. Usually they that prove Hereticks, are such as were never thoroughly grounded in the Knowledge
<PB N="128" REF="000393_0131_0FA5A8845D722D70">
of principles, never well instructed in Cate|chetical Fundamental Doctrines and points of Religion. The <HI>Waldenses</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Read the history of the Waldenses.</HI></NOTE> preserved and propagated the Interest of Religion by dili|gence in catechising their Children. When certain Jesuits were sent among them to en|tice them from the Truth to Idolatry, they returned amazed, professing that Children of seven years old amongst those <HI>Waldenses</HI> knew more in the Scripture, and of the Misteries of the Gospel, than many of their learned Doct|ors did. Take heed also how you dispose of your Children, you that are parents look at Religion and the fear of God in the Dispo|sal of your Children. That blessed man Mr. <HI>Dod</HI> (the Moses of his time) would sometimes bewail it, that Professours of Religion would say, <HI>There is a</HI> Portion <HI>and</HI> Civility, <HI>and we will hope for Grace; but</HI> (said he) <HI>rather make sure of Grace, and hope for Riches, there is far greater reason for it, since Godliness hath the Pro|mises, Riches have none.</HI> It may make us dread to think what's coming, in that it is with us as it was with the old World, the Sons of God are marrying with the Daughters of men, Church Members in disposing of their Children look more at <HI>Portion</HI> than at <HI>Piety</HI>: If their Children are like to live well in the World, and their Families to be made richer, they look

no further; a sad sign that Religion will ex|pire, and such Families be cut off from the Covenant, within a few Generations, and the branches thereof perish for ever.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Pray with all manner of prayer &amp; supplication in the Spirit.</HI> Pray as sometimes the Martyr did, <HI>Lord do not thou forsake</HI> me, <HI>lest I for|sake</HI> thee. Pray for your poor Children and posterity, as David did for his son Solomon 1. <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.19. <HI>give unto my son Solomon a per|fect heart.</HI> He did not only exhort and charge his Son to labour after such an heart, but ear|nestly <HI>prayed</HI> to God, that such an heart might be given to him. And truly, if there were more prayers poured forth before the Lord for the Converting of the <HI>rising Generation,</HI> we may hope that there would a blessed Effect fol|low. I have been told that there is a Church in N. England that hath set dayes apart only to seek unto the Lord, for converting grace to be vouchsafed to their Children. O that all other Churches would do as they have done, even seek unto the Lord by Fasting and pray|er, for a poor, perishing, dying, unconverted Generation.</P>
<P N="5">5. And Lastly. <HI>Be faithful in improving of your Civil Liberties.</HI> Beware of two Extreams, of an <HI>Issacharian Spirit,</HI> to couch under every Imposer: If you foolishly lose your <HI>Liberties,</HI>

It is a great Priviledge which you enjoy at this day, that you may choose Rulers from among your selves. And although as to what concerns the Transactions of this day, it is al|most too late to speak, yet you may hear for the time to come. <HI>Freemen,</HI> remember the oath of God that is upon you. I doubt there is lamentable guilt upon many, who in <HI>Electi|ons</HI> are acted more by interest and Faction than by conscience. You know what the Rule is, <HI>viz.</HI> that you should Choose men that are just, and that fear God and hate Covetousness. Choose men that shall aprove themselves (like <HI>Eliakim</HI>) Fathers to the inhabitants of Jerusa|lem, Choose men of Hezekiah's Spirit, who <HI>spake comfortably to all those that taught the good knowledg of the Lord.</HI> In a word, choose those that will be zealous for the interest of Refor|mation, and that therefore will improve their power to suppress Transgressions of the first, as well as of the 2<HI>nd.</HI> Table. If you will choose such (which mercy forbid that ever it should be) under whose shaddow Thorns and Briars shall thrive, and those Weeds of <HI>Pride, Con|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion, Heresie</HI> shall receive Nourishment, and Encouragement; it will be an Ominous

sign that God will ere long deprive you of your <HI>Liberties</HI> until such time as you know better how to improve them.</P>
<P>And now I hope I may say that as to the op|portunity put into my hands this day, I have discharged my Conscience, delivered my soul, and can lay down my head with peace. I con|clude with <HI>Moses,</HI> Calling Heaven and Earth to record, that <HI>life</HI> and <HI>death</HI> hath been set be|fore this Generation. O Generation see the Word of the <HI>Lord,</HI> choose <HI>Life</HI> that both thou &amp; thy seed may live. And <HI>God</HI> from Heaven saith, O that there were such an heart in this generation that they would fear me, that so it may go well with <HI>them,</HI> and with their <HI>child|dren</HI> for Ever, <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>

<P>SOlomon in this Context doth apply him|self to speak unto <HI>Young</HI> men, whom he doth, 1. Dehort. 2. Exhort. His Dehortation is in the two last verses of the former Chapter. And it is</P>

Wherefore he adds <HI>Walk in the waies of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes.</HI> This is expresly forbiden else|where in the Scripture, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mercer in loc.</HI></NOTE> A clear evidence that the wise man here speaks by way of holy

derision, and then<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> it is further added, <HI>know thou that for those things, God will bring thee to Judgment.</HI> q. d. Though its possible thou mayst escape Judgment from men, parents, Magis|trates, &amp;c. yet not from the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Dehortation is plainly expressed in the verse immediatly preceding this Text, <HI>Remove sorrow from thy heart.</HI> The Hebrew word translated <HI>Sorrow,</HI> signifieth <HI>Anger: q. d.</HI> Be|ware of inordinate passions, which young men are usually subject unto: <HI>And put away evil from thy flesh,</HI> h. e. avoid sinful pleasures. Passions and sinful pleasures are evils which young men are most in danger of being carri|ed away by; therefore he doth in special cau|tion them against iniquities of that nature: withal adding this reason, <HI>for Childhood and Youth are vanity.</HI> h. e. its soon gone, thy time (young man) to enjoy sinful and foolish plea|sures will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be past &amp; gone, it abideth not, therefore set not thy heart upon such things.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have Solomons <HI>Exhortation</HI> unto <HI>young</HI> men in this verse: wherein is expressed 1. The Act that ought to be done, <HI>Remember.</HI> 2. The Object, <HI>thy Creator.</HI> i. e. God for he, and he only is the CREATOR; since it requireth an infinite power to be able to produce a work of Creation. Hebr. <HI>[Boreeca] Thy Creatours</HI>: Not that there are more Gods or more Cre|ators than one: But there is a plurality of Persons in the Godhead. Though the work
<PB N="135" REF="000393_0137_0FA5A888ECBF75A8">
of Creation be more especially ascribed to the Father, as Redemption to the Son, and aplica|tion to the Spirit, yet each of the Persons in the Sacred and Eternal Trinity, doth concur therein. 3. The <HI>Time</HI> or Season, when this Duty ought to be attended is expressed. viz. <HI>now, in the dayes of thy youth.</HI> not that they that are past the dayes of their youth may forget God, or be exempted from this Remembrance of him, but <HI>young</HI> men are under special <HI>obli|gations</HI> and Advantages to remember Him.</P>
<P>Doctr. That <HI>as it is the duty of</HI> all, <HI>so more especially of</HI> young <HI>men to remember God their Creator.</HI> Remembring God may not be defer|red until old age, but ought to be attended in the dayes of youth.</P>
<P>In the Doctrinal prosecution of this Truth, there are three things to be enquired into, 1. What is implied in this Remembring. 2. How it doth appear that young men ought to remember God. 3. The Reason Why <HI>they</HI> especially should do so.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>What is implied in this Remembring which the Text speaks of?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is a known Rule, that in Scripture Words of Sense doe imply the affections and actions. So here, it is not every kind of Re|membrance of God, but that which is affect|ionate and practical, that is intended. Par|ticular<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc;</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="136" REF="000393_0138_0FA5B7EDC3970588">1. <HI>This Remembring doth Imply, a Turning to the Lord.</HI> Psal. 22.27. <HI>All the ends of the world shall</HI> remember <HI>and</HI> turn <HI>to the Lord.</HI> Unfeigned Repentance is Implied in this Re|membrance. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.5. <HI>Remember from whence thou art fallen and</HI> repent. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 6.9. <HI>They that escape of you shall</HI> remember <HI>me among the Nations.</HI> h. e. They shall repent and return to the Lord. And it is a penitential Rememb|rance which Solomon here speaketh of. Re|member thy Creator, that is, remember to make thy peace with him, and therefore to re|pent of Sin, and to turn to God in the dayes of thy youth.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Remembrance which the <HI>Text</HI> speak|eth of doth imply Service and Obedience. <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.55. <HI>I have remembred thy name, and have kept thy Law.</HI> As they that neglect the Worship and service which they owe to the blessed God, are said to forget him, <HI>Psal.</HI> 9.17. <HI>The wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that</HI> forget God. that is to say, <HI>they that do not serve God.</HI> When the Children of Israel had forsaken the wayes and Corrupted the Worship of God, it was said, <HI>Israel hath</HI> forgotten <HI>his Maker. Hos.</HI> 8.14. So on the other hand, The Service of God is noted by that of Remembring him. <HI>Remember thy Crea|tor in the dayes of thy youth, h. e.</HI> Seek and Serve him be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">imes. As David exhorted his son So|lomon whilst yet in his youth, 1. <HI>Chron.</HI> 28.9.
<PB N="137" REF="000393_0139_0FA5B7EE767FCC28">
<HI>Know and serve the Lord with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind.</HI> Hence the perform|ance of all Religious duties, especially that great duty of Prayer, is implied in this Rem|embring which the Text speaketh of <HI>Jonah</HI> 2.7. <HI>I remembred the Lord</HI> (saith the Prophet) and how was that? it follows, <HI>my prayer came unto thee into thine holy Temple.</HI> We read in the Gospel, of <HI>children</HI> that prayed unto the Lord, they said <HI>Hosanna,</HI> i. e. <HI>save now we beseech thee Mat.</HI> 21.15. That is implied in Rememb|ring God the Creator.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It doth also Imply Frequent thoughts and Meditations of God.</HI> Psal. 63.6. <HI>When I re|member thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.</HI> Where there is that Re|membrance of God which the Text requireth, there are frequent holy Meditations on him day and night. As Solomon exhorts <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.17. <HI>Be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long.</HI> Set God before thine eyes; where-ever thou comest think of him, from morning unto night, ever and anon, let there be awful holy thoughts in thy heart concerning the Omni|presence of God. And this is to remember him. We come therefore to the second thing to be enquried into, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>How doth it appear that young men ought to remember God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. The Lord doth require this, the Commandment saith expresly <HI>Luk.</HI> 10.27.
<PB N="138" REF="000393_0140_0FA5B7EF94D3D538">
<HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength.</HI> If men are bound to serve God with their strength, then they must not forget him until those dayes are come wherein their strentgh is gone, and they able to do him little service. Of old, God required that the first born, and the first Fruits should be given to him, <HI>Exod.</HI> 22.29. <HI>Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruit, the first born shalt thou give unto me.</HI> This did intimate that men ought to give the prime of their Age, the first and best of their strength unto the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Truth of this Doctrine is evident in that Parents are bound to teach their Chil|dren the fear of the Lord whilst they are young <HI>Deut.</HI> 6.6, 7. <HI>The words which I command thee, thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy Children,</HI> Again, it is said, <HI>Train up a Child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it,</HI> Prov. 22.6. To the same purpose is that of the Apostle. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.4. <HI>Ye fathers bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</HI> And according unto this hath been the practice of Saints. The Lord himself doth testifie concerning Abraham that he would <HI>command his children to keep the wayes of the Lord Gen.</HI> 18.19. And Solomon doth acknowledge that his father David was careful to instruct him, and put him in mind of God, whilst he was yet in the dayes of his youth, <HI>Pro.</HI> 4.3, 4.

<HI>I was my fathers son, he taught me, and said unto me, let thine heart retain my words.</HI> Yea, not only his father but his mother also taught him the fear of the Lord. <HI>Cap. ult.</HI> 1, 2. <HI>The words of King Lemuel, the Prophesy that his mother taught him, what my Son? and what the Son of my wowb? and what the Son of my vows?</HI> Now to what end were it to teach Children and young ones to fear the Lord, if they were not bound to learn and doe accordingly.</P>
<P N="3">3. Young men as well as others owe service unto God; He is their Creator as the Text expresseth. Now that one Consideration has great weight in it to enforce duty and obedi|ence. For certainly all owe service unto <HI>him,</HI> from whom they have received their Beings, <HI>Psal.</HI> 95.6. <HI>O come let us worship and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.</HI> HE hath made all for himself, from him and for him are all things. He, as Creator hath given unto men reasonable souls in respect whereof they are capable of knowing and serving the Lord: and he is able to destroy them: He that made them can destroy them; as it is said concerning that creature, <HI>He that made him, can cause his sword to aproach unto him.</HI> Job 40.19. Therefore it concerns men to fear their Creator.</P>
<P>But to proced to the third Particular, <HI>namely,</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 3. <HI>Why ought young men especially to remember their Creator?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="000393_0142_0FA5B7F36A2A8670"><HI>Answ.</HI> For <HI>these</HI> (amongst other) Reasons,</P>
<P>REAS. I. Because Youth is the fittest season to remember God in: Wherefore it is added in the Context, <HI>before the evil dayes come, when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them.</HI> Old Age is an evil Time: And therefore (saith the <HI>Wise man</HI>) thou must remember and serve God in thy <HI>good</HI> dayes, if thou wouldest have him to remember and accept of thee in thy evil dayes: if thou neglectest God in the <HI>Spring</HI> of thy years, what reason is there to think that he will regard thee when <HI>Winter</HI>-Age is come upon thee? Moreover it is not easie to turn unto the Lord in old age: A young Plant is more easily pluck'd up than an old Tree; So are young men with less Diffi|culty transplanted and plucked up out of the Soyl of Nature. than they that are grown old in the wayes of Sin.

Timothy was an eminent Minister and, (as Ecclesiastical sto|ry reports) at last he died a Martyr of Jesus Christ; now he was savingly acquainted with the holy Scriptures [<HI>apo brepheous] from a little child</HI> 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.15. Thus we see how God has owned and blessed those that have remembred their Creator in the dayes of their <HI>youth.</HI> And for that reason young men should remember God.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 3. Young men are subject to the stroke of death as wel as others <HI>Job</HI> 21.23. <HI>One dieth in his full strength.</HI> The young man of <HI>Naim</HI> whom Christ restored to life, notwithstanding his youth, was subject to Death, <HI>Luk.</HI> 7.14. And Jairus's daughter was but about 12 years of age, when she lay a dying <HI>Chapt.</HI> 8.42. Was not Eutichus a <HI>young</HI> man? and yet he fell down from an upper Chamber and was ta|ken up <HI>dead,</HI> Act. 20.9. Were not Job's Children young men? and yet they died sud|denly. Was not Absalom a young man, and his brother Adonijah a young man when death surprised them? Did not Eli's sons die in the flower of their Age? 1. Sam. 2.23. Now
<PB N="144" REF="000393_0146_0FA5B7FB76E7F820">
if young men remember their Creator so as to repent of sin, and make sure of an interest in Christ before death cometh, then happy shall they be. As Jeroboams good son tho' he were a child he died, 1. <HI>King.</HI> 14.17. but in|asmuch as in him there was <HI>found some good thing toward the Lord God of Israel,</HI> death did him no hurt, only he was taken away from the Evil to come, that his eyes might not be|hold the miserable ruin that was coming upon his Father's Family. But if death find a young man in his Sins, in an unconverted Christless estate woe to him that ever he was born! his naked soul must appear before God his Crea|tor, and receive a Sentence of eternal Damna|tion.</P>
<P><HI>VSE.</HI> I proceed therefore to improve this Truth by way of Exhortation, <HI>O let</HI> young <HI>men this day be exhorted in the Name and fear of God to follow the Counsel of the wise man, even to remember their Creator in the dayes of their youth.</HI> All you young men that are here before the Lord (and there are many such in this as|sembly) hear me this day, that so God may hear <HI>you</HI> another day, <HI>now</HI> turn to the Lord, <HI>now</HI> repent of sin, <HI>now</HI> make sure of an interest in Jesus Christ: And therefore lay to heart some motives and perswasives.</P>
<P>Mot. 1. <HI>Consider what special Reason they that are of the younger rising generation in</HI> New-Eng|land <HI>have to remember their Creator.</HI> Now there
<PB N="145" REF="000393_0147_0FA5B7FBD6F95130">
is cause for it more than ever, in that there are so few that doe so. Multitudes of young men are risen up in this Land, who have been forgetting God all their dayes; unto whom the Lord may say as <HI>Jer.</HI> 22.21. <HI>This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyest not my voice.</HI> And as it was said concerning them of old <HI>the Children of Israel, and the Chil|dren of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth</HI> Jer. 32.30. It is true, there are some young ones that are remembring and turning to the Lord, which ought to be ac|knowledged to the praise of his glorious grace, yet it must be said with Lamentation, that the generality of the youth in this Land, walk in waies of Loosness, Profaness, Pride, Drinking, Gaming, or in a careless neglect of God, and of their own souls. Hence the Lord doth not seem to take pleasure in many of the youth of this Countrey O it is a sad word that is spoken Isai. 9.17. <HI>The Lord shall have no Joy in their young men.</HI> How many young men even in <HI>New-England</HI> that have been cut off either by Sword or Sickness within these two years! Now, shall the Lord have cause to complain as he doth by the Prophet (<HI>Amos</HI> 4.10.) <HI>Your young men have I slain with the Sword yet have you not returnd unto me.</HI> Moreover, young men in this Countrey enjoy means of Grace plentifully dispensed, God is calling from Hea|ven to them, and striving with them in the

<P N="2">2. <HI>Consider how pleasing it will be to the Lord if you doe indeed remember him in the dayes of your</HI> Youth. <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.2. <HI>I remember the kindness of thy youth.</HI> You heard but now how the Lord is plea|sed with first-fruits.

the year: So when young men shall bring forth the fruit of repentance, Faith and Holi|ness, that pleaseth the Lord. He hath a spe|cial delight in Young men who truly fear and serve him, <HI>Hos.</HI> 11.1. <HI>When Israel was a</HI> child <HI>then I loved him.</HI> One of the Ancients observ|eth that Christ loved his youngest disciple best. <HI>John</HI> was the beloved disciple, &amp; he is reported to be younger at his first Calling then any of the Disciples of the Lord Jesus. And we find in Scripture how the Lord blessed little children when they came to him, or were brought to him <HI>Mark.</HI> 10.13, 14, 15, 16. <HI>They brought young children to him &mdash; and when Jesus saw it &mdash; he said, suffer little children to come unto me and for|bid them not, &mdash; and he took them up in his armes and blessed them.</HI> You young Ones hearken, would you have the Son of God to bless you? O come to him <HI>now,</HI> in the dayes of your youth and he will surely bless you, for his Armes are open to receive you. And such are the special subjects of a gracious promise <HI>Pro.</HI> 8.17. <HI>They that seek me early shall find me.</HI> If you will be perswaded to seek the Lord whilest it is yet <HI>early dayes</HI> with you, Christ hath promised that you shall find him, and everlasting life and happiness by him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Consider the danger of neglecting God in the dayes of youth.</HI> It may be it will cost thee thy life, yea the life of thy soul for ever. Who knoweth but that the time of youth is the only
<PB N="148" REF="000393_0150_0FA5B7FE331869F0">
time which the Lord will allow you to repent &amp; make your peace with God in, through Jesus Christ? If these golden dayes be lost, proba|bly thou wilt be undon forever. I must needs tell you that for the most part it is so, that men are either converted in their youth, or not at all. We read of but one that was cal|led at the eleventh hour. If a tree do not blossome in the Spring it is commonly dead all the year after; So they that are not converted in the Spring of their age are rarely converted at all. Now &amp; then <HI>one</HI> is converted in old age but such examples are exceeding rare especi|ally it is true with respect unto those that have in the dayes of their youth lived under the meanes of grace, heard many Sermons; experi|enced frequent strivings of the Spirit of God with their hearts: if they remain unconverted until the daies of their youth are past &amp; gone, the Lord usually giveth them up to judicial hardness of heart that they shall never be con|verted, never saved. Young men think sadly of it in the fear of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Consider what Examples have been set before you of early conversions.</HI> Have you not read or heard of those that have turned to God in the daies of their Youth? nay that in their child|hood the fear of God hath been planted in their hearts, that they have no sooner began to have the use of reason, but one might dis|discern

There is a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Janeway's Token for Children.</HI></NOTE> book which many of you have in your houses that giveth an account of thirteen Children, the eldest of them not above four|teen years old, some of them not seven years old some not so much, that nevertheless it was evident that the fear of God &amp; unfeigned love to Jesus Christ was wrought in their hearts. And there is a printed Relation of <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>John Clap.</HI></NOTE> a child that died not long since in this countrey, who for severa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> years before his death had his heart changed &amp; was made a new Creature. O how may this shame many young ones that are here before the Lord this day, who are older then that child was, it may be 15 year old, nay perhaps 20 year old; and for all that in a natural Christless estate to this day. Lamentable is thy condi|tion that hast lived so long under meanes of grace, and yet continuest an unconverted crea|ture. God be merciful to thee and help thee to think of it.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Consider, you have a great Work to do before you goe out of this world, &amp; but a little time to doe it in.</HI> As young as you are, you have much sin to repent of, and to obtain the pardon of; Original sin thou art guilty of, and that must be mortified, And who can declare how ma|many

thou live so long. Doth not Job complain, saying, <HI>Thou makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth, Chapt.</HI> 13.26. And did not holy David pray as in Psal. 25.7. <HI>Remember not the sins of my youth.</HI> And doth not converted <HI>E|phraim</HI> make an humble confession concerning the sins of his youth, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.19. <HI>I was a|shamed, yea even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.</HI> So it is that the re|membrance of the sins and vanities of youth, are matter of reproach and shame a long time after: yea the very thought of them doth fill the soul that is truly converted, with an holy confusion of face. Beware then of the the sins of youth. To instance in some par|ticulars: Pride is a sin that young ones are very much under the power of: hence we see that young people are strangely addicted to vanity in Apparel: Proud Fashions they must and will follow, there's no perswading them to the contrary: but beware of that sin. So for stubborness and Disobedience to Superiors, it is an evil that Youth is very sub|ject unto. You that are servants, young men and Maids that are here before the Lord, have you not been guilty of stubborn, disobedient carriages towards your Masters? though God in his Word tells you that you ought to be o|bedient to them with fear and trembling, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.5. And you that are children have not you disobeyed your Parents? Thou hast been dis|disobedient
<PB N="152" REF="000393_0154_0FA5B8014BC07028">
to thy Father sometimes, but es|pecially to thy mother. Thy heart may ake to think what is like to come on thee if thou re|pent not speedily: Did you ever know any dye upon the Gallows, but they confessed they had been guilty of this sin, and thereby pro|voked the Lord to leave them unto those things which have brought them to untimely, unhappy ends? And this is but according to what the Scripture speaketh, <HI>Prov.</HI> 30.17. <HI>The eye that mocketh at his father&punc; and despiseth to obey his mother, the Ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young eagles shall eat it.</HI> Intimat|ing that such children are like to come unto miserable and shameful deaths at last. Again, Lying is a sin which Childhood and Youth is for the most part deeply guilty of, <HI>Psal.</HI> 58.3. <HI>They go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.</HI> How natural is it for Children to com|mit a fault, and then to excuse it by telling a lye! Art thou a lying child? then the Devil is thy Father, and except thou repent of this sin and beware of it for the time to come, when once thy soul is out of thy body, it must be cast into that lake which burneth with fire &amp; brimstone which is the second death, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.44. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. 21.8. So for breaches of the se|venth Commandment, they are <HI>youthful Lusts</HI>: Wherefore <HI>Solomon</HI> saith that he looked out of the Window of his house, &amp; discerned among the youths a young man void of understand|Understanding,
<PB N="153" REF="000393_0155_0FA5B801ED0901C8">
and he was going to an Whore house like an Ox to the slaughter, or a fool to the correction of the Stocks, not knowing that it is for his life, nor considering that her house is the way to Hell, going down to the Chambers of Death, <HI>Prov,</HI> 7.7. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Young men whose natures are not changed by the regenerating grace of the Spirit of God, do usually live in some unclean lust or other. Either Fornication, or self-pollution or in se|cret wanton pranks of darkness. You young men whose consciences accuse you of guilt be|fore the Lord in respect of these evils, I charge you in the name of God, that you hum|ble your selves deeply in his sight for past Transgressions, and sin no more as ever you desire to escape eternal Damnation, Though these cursed lusts may be as dear to you as life and limbs, yet better to <HI>pluck out the right eye,</HI> to <HI>cut off the right hand, than that thy whole body should be cast into hell fire, where the worm dyeth not and where the fire never shall be quenched.</HI></P>
<P>Again, <HI>Sabbath-breaking</HI> is a sin which Young ones are often found guilty of before the Lord. There was a <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Thomas Savage, who was executed at Ratcliffe-Cross Octob.</HI> 28. 1668.</NOTE> young man (whom many of you have heard of) that came to an untimely end, and the sin of Sabbath-breaking made way to his ruin: when he should have been hear|hearing
<PB N="154" REF="000393_0156_0FA5B802CFB25750">
the word on the Lords day, he would rather go to wicked Houses, that at last God was so provoked with him, as to leave him to commit a capital sin, upon the Sabbath day, for which he was brought to deserved executi|on. And when in prison he said to some that came to visit him, <HI>O wretch that I was, I studied how I might spend the Lords day in the Devil's work: that time which I should have served God in, I did most for Satan in it. O</HI> (said he) <HI>tell young men from me, that the breaking of the Sab|bath is a dangerous and costly sin.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore young men beware of that sin. <HI>Remember the Sabbath to keek it holy,</HI> or you will never remember your Creator as you ought to do.</P>
<P>Once more, Sinful <HI>Company-keeping</HI> is an evil that young men are apt to be drawn away from God their Creator by. Many an hope|ful young man, that hath been well, instruct|ed, that hath had great Convictions upon his Spirit, and friends that wished him well have been comforted in him; yet hath afterwards fallen in with bad company, &amp; that has prov'd the eternal ruin of his soul. I have known young men that upon sick-beds and death-beds, have made lamentable cries <HI>O my sinful Com|pany-keeping hath undone me for ever!</HI> There|fore let young men remember what the Scrip|ture speaketh to them, <HI>My son, if sinners entice thee consent thou not. Walk not thou in the way
<PB N="155" REF="000393_0157_0FA5B803631D1320">
of them, refrain thy foot from their path,</HI> Prov. 1.10, 15. Again, <HI>He that walketh with the wise shall be wise, but a Companion of fools shall be de|stroyed</HI> Chapt. 13.20. Young man, would'st thou not be destroyed? then be not a com|panion of Fools. Remember also what Da|vid saith, and follow his Example, <HI>Psal.</HI> 26.4, 5, &mdash; 9. <HI>I have not sate with vain persons. I have hated y^e congregation of evil doers &amp; will not sit with the wicked. Gather not my soul with sinners.</HI> When thou diest, thou wouldest not have thy soul to be gathered to the place where sin|ners must be forever; then sit not with them, hold not Familiarity with them now: for they that are thy Companions and thy Familiars here, are like to be so to Eternity.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hearken to good Instruction.</HI> In the holy Scriptures God himself instructs you, and therefore let young ones be diligent in reading the Scripture, that is the way to become like unto <HI>Timothy,</HI> to whom it was said, <HI>From a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto Salvation, through the faith that is in Christ Jesus.</HI> 2. Tim. 3.15. And when David had propounded that Quest|tion, <HI>wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way</HI>? The Answer given is, <HI>by taking heed thereto according to thy word,</HI> Psal. 119.9. For the most part it is so that the wayes of young men need cleansing. Youth is com|monly the unclean part of a mans Age, but
<PB N="156" REF="000393_0158_0FA5B80543496288">
those young men that will make conscience to order their wayes &amp; walkings according to the Word of God, shall thereby be cleansed. And the Word preached and publickly dispensed, is a meanes appointed by the Lord for the in|struction of young ones that they may learn the fear of God, <HI>Deut.</HI> 31.12, 13. <HI>Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and that their Children which have not known any thing may learn to know the Lord.</HI> And therefore mind seriously what the Ministers of God speak in his name. Mind it young men, lest you mourn at last and say <HI>How have I hated instruction, and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor enclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</HI> Yea; and hearken to the good instructions which you receive from those whom God hath set over you. Have you not Masters, Fathers, Mothers, that admonish you, &amp; give you good counsel from day to day? despise them not. Doth not the Scripture say to you, <HI>Hear ye children the In|struction of a Father.</HI> Prov. 4.1. And again, <HI>My son hear the Instruction of thy Father, and forsake not the Law of thy mother.</HI> Chapt. 1.18. Eternal woe is like to be the portion of those Children, that regard not what Father and Mother say to them. Remember Eli's sons, they were proud and head-strong; their Fa|ther reproved them and exhorted them to a|amend
<PB N="157" REF="000393_0159_0FA5B8084C20C450">
their wayes, it is said, <HI>notwithstanding they hearkned not to the voice of their Father, be|cause the Lord would slay them,</HI> 1. Sam. 2.25. Art thou the young man that wilt not obey the voice of thy Father when he giveth thee good counsel? this is a sign that the Lord will <HI>slay thee</HI>: a sad sign that thou art appoint|ed for some terrible destruction at the last.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Remember those things, which if duly thought on, may cause you to remember your Creator in the dayes of your Youth.</HI> e. g. Think sadly of the Preciousness of Time, that so you may pass the time of your sojourning here in fear. You Young men, are exeeding apt to mispend pre|cious hours, nay dayes in sin and vanity, but it is because you do not consider how precious time is. Are not some that were once your companions in sin, dead, &amp; (as there is cause to fear) dropp'd down into hell? they would give worlds (were it in their power) to enjoy that precious time that is lost, and can never be re|gained. Shortly your time to remember your Creator in will be past and gone for ever. Re|member also the worth of your own souls, <HI>What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</HI> If he gain the whole world and lose his own soul, what is he profited? Young men and children do you think of this? as young as you are you have immortal souls that must either be saved or damned, that when once you are dead, your souls must go to be ei|either
<PB N="158" REF="000393_0160_0FA5B8090525FE40">
in Heaven or Hell to all eternity. And <HI>REMEMBER DEATH</HI> which may be upon you ere you be aware of it. Thou knowst not but that this night thy soul may be taken from thee. It hath been truly said&punc; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aquinas.</HI></NOTE> <HI>An old man hath death before his face, but a young man hath death behind his back,</HI> that may overtake him before he thinks of any such thing. Children may dye as well as others, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.23. <HI>I will kill her children with death.</HI> I remember, I have somewhere read of a se|rious godly Child, that would not speak vain words, like other children, but was careful to improve his time well, and being asked the reason of his Seriousness, <HI>O</HI> (saith he) <HI>I re|member that I must dye</HI>: When some replied to him, You are Young, and may live many a fair day, what should <HI>you</HI> think of death for? <HI>Nay</HI> (said he) <HI>I was in the Burying-place, and there I saw a grave that was shorter than I am.</HI> So Children, look into the <HI>Burying-place,</HI> and there you will see Graves that are shorter than you are: there you will see that those that have been as young as you are, and younger too have dyed and bin put into their graves, and therefore it may be so with you. O then Remember your Creator in the dayes of your Youth. And remember the day of Judgement. As Solomon in this Context saith, <HI>Know, O
<PB N="159" REF="000393_0161_0FA5B80C24CFD400">
young man, that God will bring thee to Judgment.</HI> Young men are apt to put the Thoughts of Death and Judgment far away, and therefore they remember not their Creator. Think with thy self, I must stand before Jesus Christ the Son of God at the great day, and what shall I then say to him? and what will the Lord in that Day say unto me? will he say, <HI>Come thou blessed,</HI> or will he not say to me, <HI>Goe thou cursed.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Look unto Jesus Christ.</HI> O betake your selves to Him. He calls from Heaven unto you young men and Children, that are before the Lord this day, go to <HI>Him</HI> by Prayer, and to <HI>God</HI> by Him. Some of you, when you are ask|ed that Question, <HI>Do you pray</HI>? Answer, <HI>I can|not pray</HI>: You would do it, you say, but you know not how to pray. Why, get into a se|cret place, and there lift up thine eyes and heart to the Lord Jesus, and if thou canst say nothing else, yet say, <HI>O thou Son of God have Mercy on me! O convert me and save my poor Soul!</HI> who knoweth but the Lord from on high may look upon thee, since the Lord Je|sus himself hath said, <HI>They that seek me early shall find me.</HI></P>

And it was never known since the world began, that the Spirit of prayer was awak|ned in the Hearts of those that can cry <HI>Abba Father,</HI> but some grace and blessed effect did in due time follow: <HI>He said not to the seed of Ja|cob, seek ye me in vain.</HI> O that God would bow the heart of <HI>New-England,</HI> even of all his Saints in these Churches, as one man, to cry might|ily to Heaven, that his Spirit may be poured on the now <HI>risen</HI> (a multitude of sinful men that are ri|sen up in their fathers stead) and upon the after <HI>rising Generation.</HI> The Lords People have need of something to comfort them, in this day, when there are so many doleful Symptoms of approaching wrath and ruin. Now if God say unto his Pray|ing ones amongst us, Seek ye my face for the rising Generation, and their hearts answer again, <HI>Lord thy face we will seek for them,</HI> that will be no small encouragement to Faith, that the blessed de|sign of our Fathers (<HI>now with Christ, beholding His glory</HI>) who transported themselves into this vast, and then waste Wilderness, in special with re|spect to Posterity, that so they might leave a Seed that shall serve him, and be accounted to the Lord for a Generation, will not be wholly frustrate.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THe Prophet having in the Conclusion of the preceding Chapter, in the Name of God, denounced heavy Judg|ment to come upon the apostate Church of <HI>Is|rael,</HI> he doth proceed in this Chapter to speak by way of Consolation to the godly Remnant amongst them; and for that end doth put them in mind of a most gracious and glorious promise; under which we have,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Persons concerned or, the <HI>Subject</HI> of this promise, viz. The <HI>Israel</HI> of God, <HI>ver.</HI> 1. <HI>Yet hear now O Jacob my Servant, &amp;</HI> Israel <HI>whom</HI> I <HI>have chosen.</HI> who are described from their po|litical birth, <HI>ver.</HI> 2. <HI>Thus saith the LORD that made thee and formed thee from the womb.</HI> The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gatak. in locum English Annotat.

<PB N="166" REF="000393_0166_0FA5B811CBB5A288">
the Lord brought them out of Egypt they were then formed to be a people for himself; The Lord moulded them up into a proporti|onable frame of Church and State: for which cause did the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> begin their Religious account, (albeit their civil account began six moneths before that) from the time of the year when they came out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> since that then they seemed to begin their life. And then they were a <HI>Jeshurun; Thou Jeshu|run,</HI> h. e. a righteous People as to their Con|stitution and Profession, according to the sig|nification of the Name <HI>Jeshurun</HI>; they were wholly a right seed, under most righteous Lawes.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have the <HI>Blessing promised</HI> in the 3<HI>d.</HI> verse: And it is first expressed, then explain|ed. It is expressed in the former part of the verse <HI>I will pour water upon the thirsty,</HI> (so the verse should be read) <HI>and flouds upon the dry ground</HI>: alluding partly unto plentiful show|ers, whereby the thirsty earth is made fruitful; and partly unto Rivers, such as <HI>Nilus</HI> in <HI>E|gypt,</HI> the floods and seasonable overflowings whereof do enrich the Earth. The Promise is explained in the latter part of the verse, (the words that are before us to insist on) <HI>I will pour out my spirit and my blessing.</HI> h. e. that wonderful blessing of the Spirit: They are spiritual waters which are here spoken of; no other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owers than those that come down from
<PB N="167" REF="000393_0167_0FA5B8127ABFA088">
the third &amp; highest Heaven. And this promise is further illustrated from the blessed <HI>Extent</HI> of it, in that not only Parents but Children are concerned therein: On thy Seed, <HI>i. e.</HI> thy Children, and on thine <HI>Off-spring</HI> i. e. <HI>Post|erity</HI> as some render the word <HI>Hebr. [I will pour my blessing upon thy young spriggs]</HI> The Children of Gods Servants, that spring from them, and must succeed when they are dead and gone out of the world, are intended by this expression.</P>
<P>Concerning the fulfilment of this promise, this (as well as many other Scriptures, which are prophetical and promissory) doth admit of a Typical and partial, as also an Antitypi|cal and more plenary accomplishment. The Lords people whilst in <HI>Babylon</HI> were like unto dry and desolate ground, but the Lord reviv|ed them afterwards, and brought them into a flourishing estate, and there was a glorious work of the Spirit of God in that matter, <HI>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI> And there will be a more glo|rious accomplishment of this Prophecy and Promise, when God shall pour out a Spirit of Converting grace upon the body of the <HI>Israel|itish</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>Moreover, the words being a special branch of the Covenant of Grace, which God hath established with his Servants, and with their Children, Gentiles are concerned therein as
<PB N="168" REF="000393_0168_0FA5B8134CB1CD38">
well as Jews; for upon them is come the bles|sing of Abraham by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>And indeed the words have special reference unto New-Testament times, which is also in|timated by that expression of <HI>pouring the Spirit.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Dr. Owen of the Spirit. p.</HI> 87.</NOTE> God is said to <HI>give</HI> his Spirit, under the Old Testament, but it is very observable, that he is not said to <HI>pour</HI> his Spirit upon men, except in the New Testament, or in Scriptures that do referr to the dayes of the Gospel.</P>
<P>The Doctrine which we may take up from the words, is</P>
<P>Doct. That <HI>One of the greatest blessings pro|mised in the Covenant of grace,</HI> is, <HI>That the Lord will pour his Spirit upon the Children and posterity of his Servants.</HI></P>
<P>Now for the clearing of this Doctrine, Four things may be enquired into: 1. What is here meant by the Spirit? 2. What is im|plied in this <HI>pouring</HI> the Spirit? 3. How it doth appear that the Pouring of the Spirit up|on Children is a great blessing: 4. The Reason why the Lord hath made such a Promise.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>What is here meant by the Spirit?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Spirit is not here taken in a personal sense? altho it be a glorious Truth, that the Holy Ghost himself doth dwell in the Hearts of Believers, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>v. Mr. Cot|tons Ans. to Bayly. p.</HI> 36, 37, 36. <HI>Dr. Owen of Perseverance c.</HI> 8 &amp; <HI>Burgess on</HI> 1 <HI>cor.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 207 208</NOTE> yet he is not as to his
<PB N="169" REF="000393_0169_0FA5B813FB7442B8">
Person said to be poured on men for so he is equally in all the Saints: whereas this expres|sion of <HI>pouring</HI> the Spirit intimates a larger communication of him to some, than to others. Wherefore the Phrase is <HI>Metonymical,</HI> that be|ing affirmed of the Cause, which is proper to the Effect. In respect of his effects and Ope|rations the Holy Ghost is poured forth upon his Servants.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then by the Spirit here is meant, the <HI>Gifts</HI> of the Spirit, All spirituall gifts, espe|cially Illumination in the Misteries of the Gos|pel are from the Holy Ghost: Hence they that have such gifts are said to be <HI>made partak|ers of the holy Ghost,</HI> Heb. 6.4. He that hath a gift of Knowledge or a gift of Prayer hath received it from the Holy Ghost, and the Spi|rit of the Lord is <HI>so far</HI> poured upon him. And the gifts of the Spirit, are compared un|to Water in the Scripture, <HI>Joh.</HI> 7.38, 39. <HI>He that believeth on me, out of his Belly (i. e.</HI> his heart) <HI>shall flow rivers of living water: this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.</HI> For as waters do refresh the bodies of men; so the gifts of the Holy Ghost do refresh their souls. When the Lord did showr down his Spirit in that plentiful mea|sure on the Apostles, Thousands of souls were refreshed and revived thereby. This then is partly meant here, when it is said, I will pour my spirit on your seed, <HI>h. e.</HI> your Children,
<PB N="170" REF="000393_0170_0FA5B815465039E8">
shall have gifts of the Holy Ghost bestowed upon them they shall be taught to know the Lord, from the greatest to the least.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the Spirit here, <HI>Converting, Sancti|fying Grace</HI> is meant: The Spirit is put for the graces thereof. Conversion is the special work of the Holy Ghost. The Conversion of the House of David <HI>h. e.</HI> the Elect of God is intimated by that of <HI>pouring a Spirit of grace upon them,</HI> Zech. 12.10. Grace is wrought in the soul by no other hand than that of the Spirit. When God sends down his Spirit to accompany his Word and Ordinances, then converting work goeth on, but if he with|hold the efficacious influences of his Holy Spirit converting work will be at a stand, all meanes and outward Dispensations notwith|standing. Wherefore Conversion or Regene|ation is called, <HI>the Renewing of the Holy Ghost, Tit.</HI> 3.5. These words then, are a Promise &amp; gracious Intimation unto the Lords people, that a spirit of converting grace shall be pour|ed upon their Children.</P>
<P>We come to the second enquiry, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What is implied in this pouring of the Spirit, which the Text speaks of?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. This expression doth imply, that <HI>The Graces of the Spirit are fitly resembled unto Water</HI>: So much is intimated by the Meta|phor of <HI>pouring,</HI> which alludeth unto the
<PB N="171" REF="000393_0171_0FA5B81882BD2430">
Clouds pouring down rain upon the Earth. Water is of a purifying nature, so the waters of the Spirit, Sanctifying grace doth cleanse and purify the souls of men <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.25. <HI>I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your I|dols will I cleanse you.</HI> The guilt of Sin is washed away in the blood of Christ; the filth of Sin is purged by those blessed waters which do Proceed from the spirit of Christ, even converting, sanctifying grace: For the same reason Grace is compared unto fire <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.11. Metals, Gold &amp; silver are purified unto fire, other things by water: therefore are the blessed operations of the Holy Ghost compared both to the one and to the other. Water is of a Mollifying nature; the Earth that is dry and hard is thereby softened, <HI>Psal.</HI> 67.10. <HI>Thou visitest the earth and wateredst it</HI> thou greatly enrichest it with the River of God which is full of water <HI>thou makest it soft with showers.</HI> So does converting grace soften the dry and hard hearts of the Children of men. That heart which was as hard as stone before, if once a spirit of converting grace be poured thereon, it doth become soft and plyable like water. Again, Water maketh fruitful, showers and flouds do so: thus when the Lord doth rain the waters of the spirit or, cause them to flow over the souls of men, they are
<PB N="172" REF="000393_0172_0FA5B8193B50C8B0">
made fruitfull in the works of Righteousness <HI>Isai.</HI> 32.15. <HI>Vntil the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the Wilderness become a fruitful field.</HI> That soul that was a desolate parched barren Wilderness, when once the Spirit from on high is poured upon it, doth become like a fruitful field, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 34.26, 27. Fruits of Holiness and Righteousness are the effect of be|ing watered by the Spirit of GOD; only the converted man, that hath grace in his soul is indeed fruitful, others are barren and deso|late ground. Once more, Water is of an heal|ing nature; So are the waters of the Spirit, sin is the souls sickness, grace is the souls health, the wound received by Original corruption is in some measure healed by con|verting Grace, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 47.9. <HI>For they shall be healed, and every thing shall live whither the Ri|ver cometh.</HI> Those words are a Prophesy con|cerning the Conversion of the Gentiles, by meanes of that healing virtue which does at|tend the blessed waters of the Gospel.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Expression of <HI>pouring</HI> the Spirit does intimate, <HI>An abundant measure of the Spirit,</HI> i. e. of the gifts and graces thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Pouring</HI> is something more than <HI>Sprinkling,</HI> as when there cometh a plentiful rain from heaven, enough to satisfie dry ground, it comes <HI>pouring</HI> down. As Elihu speaks <HI>Job</HI> 36.27, 28.
<PB N="173" REF="000393_0173_0FA5B819E924AB48">
He maketh small drops of water, they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof, which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. So this pouring of the Spirit noteth a great showr of grace, hence it is said in the context that, flouds shall be poured on the dry ground: Now a floud of grace inti|mates a great measure thereof. There are many Scripture Expressions that confirm this, Prov. 1.23. <HI>I will pour out my Spirit upon you.</HI> The Hebrew word [<HI>Nabang</HI>] which is there translated <HI>pour,</HI> signifieth to <HI>spring up,</HI> intimat|ing that the spirit of grace in the souls of be|lievers is like a fountain, where is an abund|ance of water, <HI>Isa.</HI> 32.15. <HI>until the spirit be pour|ed out upon us from on high.</HI> The Hebrew word <HI>Gnadah</HI> signifieth to <HI>make bare</HI>; so that the meaning is, that there shall be a Manifest, con|spicuous pouring forth of the spirit that all the world shall take notice of it. and indeed when a soul is converted, there is an abundant effusion of the spirit to accomplish such a strange thing as that is, to change such a cursed Na|ture, to renew such a vile heart, must needs proceed from a plentiful effusion of the Spirit. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.5.6. <HI>By the washing of Regeneration, and Renewing of the holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savi|our.</HI> Wherefore when it is said, I will pour my Spirit on thy seed, and my blessing on thine
<PB N="174" REF="000393_0174_0FA5B81AF50B2D88">
Offspring; The Lord doth graciously pro|mise his Servants, that their Children shall at|tain unto an eminency of Spiritual gifts, and unto large measures of Grace and Holiness.</P>
<P>We come now to the Third Enquiry, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 3. <HI>How doth it appear that the</HI> pour|ing of the Spirit upon Children <HI>is a great Blessing?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. In that the Gift of the Holy Ghost is mentioned in the Scripture as a great and wonderful thing. It is said <HI>Act.</HI> 10.45. <HI>They were astonished because that on the Gentiles was</HI> poured out the gift <HI>of the Holy Ghost.</HI> Yea, it is mentioned as such a gift as is equivalent to all good things, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.11. <HI>Your Father which is in Heaven shall give good things to them that ask him.</HI> Now in <HI>Luke</HI> it is expressed, by say|ing, <HI>Your Heavenly Father shall give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him.</HI> Chapt. 11.13. So then the gift of the Spirit is virutally all good things. Truly if God pour his Spirit upon our Children he doth more for them, than if he bestowed all the good things in the world upon them. This is the great promise of the Gospel: As the great promise of the Old Test|ament was concerning the <HI>Coming of the Messi|as,</HI> so the great promise of the New-Testa|ment doth respect a more plentiful Effusion of the Spirit of Grace. Hence the pouring down of the Spirit, is noted by that Expressi|expression
<PB N="175" REF="000393_0175_0FA5B81BC00E7EF0">
of the promise of the Father <HI>Act.</HI> 1. And he is called <HI>the Spirit of promise,</HI> Ephes. 1.13. as being the great gift which God hath promised to bestow upon his Servants.</P>
<P><HI>The Truth is evident in that the Blessing here spoken of, is an everlasting Blessing.</HI> Eternal good things are the Cheif: So is this bless|ing of the Spirit, upon whom he is poured, upon them &amp; in them, he remaineth for ever|more. The Hebrew word [<HI>Jatzak</HI>] which is here translated <HI>Pour,</HI> signifieth to <HI>Fasten,</HI> as well as to <HI>Pour: I will</HI> fasten <HI>my Spirit upon your children.</HI> That <HI>In-dwelling</HI> of the person of the Holy Ghost in believers, which the New-Test|ament speaketh so much of, is everlasting: He abideth with them and in them forever, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.16. And the graces of the Spirit which he doth pour upon his People are everlasting: common gifts may cease, but special grace a|bideth to Eternity. It is a seed of God that is incorruptible which liveth and abideth for|ever, 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.23. As the Holy Fire (which signified the Holy Ghost his coming down from Heaven into the Hearts of his People) it never went out; No more shall Grace dye, or be totally extinguished in a Believing soul: Hence <HI>true</HI> Grace is compared unto living (<HI>i. e. spring) water,</HI> which never runs dry: yea to <HI>great Rivers</HI> in respect of their <HI>perennity.</HI> Great Ri-Rivers
<PB N="176" REF="000393_0176_0FA5B81C19121740">
are alwayes running from the begining of the World to the end thereof; So is true Saving Grace of an Everlasting Nature, <HI>Isa.</HI> 41.18.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A Spirit of Converting grace is such a Bles|sing as never goeth alone</HI>: That setteth forth the Greatness and eminency of it. If (saith the Apostle) God give us his Son, shall he not with him give us all things? <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.32. So if the Lord give his holy Spirit to us, and to our children; shall he not with him give us all things? Godliness hath the promise of this life, and of that which is to come 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.8. We should not trouble our selves about laying up great portions, or much of the things of this world for our children, if we can but prevail with God to pour his Spirit on them, to give Grace to them, they are sure never to want as long as they live in this world. Is not pardon of Sin a rich and glorious blessing, which our poor Children because they are <HI>our</HI> Off-spring stand in need of? Now if the Lord pour a Spirit of converting Grace upon them, their sins shall be forgiven, <HI>Mark.</HI> 4.12. Is not eternal Life and Glory a great bless|ing? The pouring of the Spirit on the soul is a certain sign and evidence of one that is designed unto eternal Life in Heaven. There|fore the Scripture speaketh of the <HI>first fruit
<PB N="177" REF="000393_0177_0FA5B81CF2651B98">
of the Spirit</HI> Eph. 1.14. If the Lord give grace to our Children he will give glory too, yea he will with-hold from them no good thing <HI>Psal.</HI> 84.11.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But why hath the Lord promised to doe thus for his Servants?</HI></P>
<P>Reas. 1. <HI>From the Exceeding Riches of the Grace of God.</HI> That the Lord most high who hath an absolute Dominion over the works of his hands should at all deal with man in a Co|venant way, or make any promise to him, is from grace; much more that he should deal thus with fallen man: And that he should extend his Covenant not only to parents but to their Children also; that their Of-spring with them are under the wings of the Cove|nant. And moreover, that he should promise so great a Blessing as that of giving his Spirit, and yet more, that his Spirit should be <HI>poured</HI> upon them: We may well cry out as they did <HI>Zech.</HI> 4.7. <HI>Grace! grace!</HI> None but a God of infinite Grace would have done thus.</P>
<P>Reas. 2. <HI>Because the Children of Gods people do many of them belong to Election,</HI> As it is ex|pressed in the context <HI>Jesurun whom I have cho|sen</HI>; That Election of God is mentioned as the ground of this promise in the Text. The E|lect of God are the proper Subjects of this promise. The Lord in the Covenant of grace hath not only promised that whoever doth
<PB N="178" REF="000393_0178_0FA5B81DE9E21778">
truly believe &amp; repent, shall be saved; but as to the Elect there is a promise of the first grace, even that <HI>converting</HI> grace should be poured on them, they shall be made to repent and be|lieve. A new heart shall be given to the house of Israel h. e. the Elect tipified by the house of Israel, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.16. Now God hath seen meet to cast the line of Election so, as that it doth (though not wholly and only, yet) for the most part run through the loyns of godly parents. There are, it is true, Elect Children, who are not born of elect parents, but there are few (if any) Elect Parents without elect children: Sometimes all the Children belong to Election as we see in the many sons of Jacob, (however some of them) that the Lord remembers and establisheth his Covenant with. The Scripture doth frequently hint this Truth, that <HI>elect children are for the most part cast upon elect Parents.</HI> See <HI>Psal.</HI> 103.17. <HI>Isai.</HI> 59.20. and 65.22, 23. 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.5. 2. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. And Observation doth confirm it. For wee see that the Elect of God are not in all Nations alike, but in some the Lord gathers his Elect to himself from generation to Generation. And there are some Families that the Lord hath Chosen above others and therefore poureth his Spirit upon the Off-spring in such Families successively. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In my Sermons on</HI> 1. <HI>Chron.</HI> 28.9.</NOTE> But of
<PB N="179" REF="000393_0179_0FA5B81E921E1B78">
this I have spoken more largely else-where and therefore shall not insist further upon it now.</P>
<P>Reas. 3. <HI>That so godly parents might be en|couraged to</HI> pray <HI>and believe for their Children.</HI> It is marvelous pleasing unto God when his Servants pray and believe not only for them|selves but for their Children also. Now a promise is an encouragement unto prayer: David found in his heart to pray that God would bless his Family forever, because the Lord had promised that it should be so 2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 7.3, <HI>ult.</HI> Men should not think with them|selves, (as some do) if their Children do belong to God, then he will convert them whether they pray for it or no, but should therefore be stirred up to the more fervency in cries to Heaven, for the blessing promised. <HI>I</HI> (saith the Lord) <HI>will give a new heart to you and to your Children,</HI> yet you must pray for it. <HI>I will yet for this be enquired of the house of Israel to doe it for them,</HI> Ezek. 36, 26, 37. And a promise is an encouragement to Faith, as well as unto prayer: As <HI>Paul</HI> said, <HI>I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me,</HI> Act. 27.25. So a Believer may say, God hath told me that he will bless me and my Family, that he will pour his Spirit upon my poor Children, and therefore I believe God, that it shall be as he hath told me.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="000393_0180_0FA5B821AC9738E0"><HI>VSE.</HI> Let it be for <HI>Exhortation</HI> and <HI>Encour|agement</HI> unto that which is the special ground of our being before the Lord this day, viz.</P>
<P><HI>To pray that a Spirit of Converting Grace may be poured down from heaven upon our Children, and the Rising Generation in New-England.</HI></P>
<P>I would direct this Exhortation,</P>
<P N="1">1. To Parents, 2. To Children.</P>
<P N="1">1. To Parents, Consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>How needful a thing it is to be much in prayer on this account.</HI> Converting grace is of absolute necessity in order to Salvation, and that as to the Children of Godly parents as well as others, for they are born in Sin as <HI>Da|vid</HI> confesseth, <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.5. <HI>I was shapen in I|niquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me</HI>: yet his mother was a precious godly woman; and for ought that doth appear to the contra|ry, his father was a good man too: wherefore such Children dying in a natural unconverted estate, are lyable to Wrath and Death and Curse and Hell Eph. 2.3. <HI>We also,</HI> even we that are Jews, and not Gentiles only, we that are the Elect of God: yea, we that are chosen to be Apostles and ministers of Christ, <HI>wereby nature the Children of wrath even as others.</HI> So that except the Lord send forth his Spirit and renew the souls, change the Natures of our poor Children, they are never like to see Heaven. <HI>Verily, verily I say unto you except
<PB N="181" REF="000393_0181_0FA5B82228E6E6C8">
a man be born again he cannot see the Kingdome of God,</HI> Joh, 3.3. You that are Parents, are you willing that the Children of your own Bowells should be miserable throughout the dayes of Eternity? that they should ly burn|ing in a fiery Ocean as long as God shall be God? yet so it must be except the Lord in Mercy look upon them so as to pour down of his spirit from on high upon them.</P>
<P>Moreover, Prayer is needful upon this ac|count, in that Conversions are become rare in this age of the world. They that have their thoughts exercised in discerning things of this nature, have sad apprehensions with reference unto this matter: That the work of Conversion hath been at a great stand in the world: In the last age, in the dayes of our Fathers, in other parts of the world, scarce <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Fulfilling of Scriptures. pag.</HI> 416.</NOTE> a Sermon preached but some evident|ly converted; yea, sometimes hundreds in a Sermon: which of us can say we have seen the like? Clear sound Conversions are not frequent in some Congregations. The body of the rising Generation is a poor perishing, unconverted, and (except the Lord pour down his spirit) an undone Generation. Ma|ny that are Profane, Drunkards, Swearers, lascivious, Scoffers at y^e power of godliness, des|pisers of those that are good, proud, disobedient

Creatures, God from heaven pitty them! O|thers that are only civil, and outwardly con|formed to good order, by reason of their edu|cation, but never knew what the New birth meanes; pray for them that they may not only come <HI>near,</HI> but enter <HI>into</HI> the Kingdome of God.</P>
<P>Consider. 2. <HI>That Prayer is a notable means to obtain this mercy.</HI> Prayer opens the win|dows of Heaven, <HI>Elias</HI> prayed that it might rain, and Heaven gave showrs: Prayer brings down the showrs of Blessing in a proper literal sense: but especially these spiritual showrs which the Text speaketh of, wherein the Lord promiseth to showr down his spirit upon our poor Children. Assuredly if there be Prayers &amp; tears before the Lord on this ac|count, they will come pouring down again in showrs of grace at last. I have read of an e|minent Minister of Christ, that having prayed fervently with some Christian Friends, they in the next room felt strange illapses of the Spirit upon their hearts, so as that one said, <HI>O what a man is this that can knock down the spi|rit of God into all our hearts!</HI> Who knows but that wee may pray down the spirit of God in|to the souls of our Children, <HI>Luk.</HI> 11.9. <HI>Knock and it shall be opened to you, ask, and it shall be given you.</HI> What shall then be given? even the holy Spirit to them that ask him, <HI>ver.</HI> 13.
<PB N="183" REF="000393_0183_0FA5B8285C527530">
O then Let us knock hard at Heaven gates this day; certainly such requests are welcome to Heaven, yea, to <HI>God</HI> in Heaven, He hath shewed how acceptable such requests are to Him by gracious answers: Christ said unto his Disciples, <HI>Behold I send the promise of my Father,</HI> (meaning the spirit of Promise,) <HI>upon you, but tarry ye in the City Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high</HI> Luk. 24.49. And what were they to doe at Jerusalem in the mean time? no question but (as some have noted) they were much in fasting and Prayer that this Promise of the Father might come upon them. And not long after there was a most gracious and glorious effusion of the Spirit. And of latter times, God has been entreated to send down his spirit abundantly for the Conversion of souls, Not fifty years agoe, at a place in Scotland, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Idem eodem Libro. pag.</HI> 417.</NOTE> a great number of praying christians met together, when a Sermon was to be preached the next day, and they spent the night afore in Prayer that the Lord would own the word then to be spoken for the Conversion of souls, and Be|hold the Lord went forth with his Word, so that near upon Five Hundred Souls were wrought upon and Converted by that one Sermon. I have been told of a Church
<PB N="184" REF="000393_0184_0FA5B828C44619D8">
in <HI>New-England</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>At Milford.</HI></NOTE> that set apart a day for this end, that they might by Fasting and Pray|er beg converting grace for their Children; &amp; that since the gospel has bin made successful in that Congregation so as that a day of <HI>publick</HI> Thanksgiving hath been attended, in that so many of the younger, rising generation have been brought home to Christ. Now if the Lord awaken a spirit of Prayer concerning this thing in these Churches generally, there will doubtless be some blessed effect of it, with re|spect to the Rising generation: And where|as God hath put it into our hearts to set apart this day, thus to seek unto him, I am Perswad|ed it shall not be in vain but that there are a number of souls belonging to this Congregati|on, that must have the Spirit of the Lord Poured down on them; sheep that are not yet brought home into the Lords Fold, that must <HI>hear the voice of the Son of God and live.</HI> Since the Time that we agreed thus to set apart this day, God hath sent down plentiful showrs whereby the dry &amp; thirsty ground is wonder|fully refreshed: And is not that a token for good that those blessed showrs which we are <HI>fasting</HI> &amp; <HI>praying</HI> for this day, shall in due time come down upon the <HI>souls</HI> of our poor children?</P>
<P>Consider. 3. <HI>What encouragement we have to be at this work.</HI> The success which such Pray-Prayers
<PB N="185" REF="000393_0185_0FA5B82A19FFD688">
have had (of which something hath been mentioned) and much more might be spoken) should encourage us. As for some of us, our Fathers &amp; Mothers now in glory, did pray for us when they were in the world, and God heard them: Did they whom we are sprung from pray for us? and hath God heard them? will he not hear us, if we goe and <HI>pray</HI> for <HI>our</HI> Off-spring, and have we not already seen some answers? If we look into our Fa|milies do we not discern that as to some of our Children, the fear of God is put into their hearts? And why should we not look upon that as a first fruits, that all the rest of our Children shall be converted in due Time? Moreover, the consideration of the Covenant, and Promises of God respecting Children, are a great encouragement to pray for them. This is his <HI>everlasting</HI> Covenant, <HI>I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.</HI> Gen. 17.7. This promise is expressed indefinitely, and Therefore doth encourage godly Parents to plead with the Lord for mercy and Grace for <HI>ALL</HI> their Children: As an Holy man once said, (and it was a great word of faith in him) <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Dr. Winter of Infant Baptism. p.</HI> 105, 107.</NOTE> <HI>If I had twenty Children I would not 'bate God one of them.</HI> He hath promised to be a God to my Children indefinitly, and therefore I'le pray for them <HI>all,</HI> and believe for them <HI>all,</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="000393_0186_0FA5B82A8A68E6D8">
And why should it not be so, since the Lord himself hath said, <HI>ALL thy children shall be taught of God,</HI> Isai. 54.13. And the Script|ure doth abound with particular promises re|specting the Conversion and Salvation of the Children of godly Parents. When thou doest that which is good &amp; right in the sight of God, it shall go well with <HI>thy Children after thee for|ever</HI> Deut. 12.28. There is <HI>special</HI> mercy belonging to those that are the seed of the <HI>Blessed of the Lord,</HI> and to their Offspring with them <HI>Isai.</HI> 65.23. Yea, Promises of con|verting grace to be <HI>poured</HI> upon them, <HI>Zech&middot;</HI> 10.9. <HI>They shall live with their Children, and turn again.</HI> The Children of the Lords Peo|ple shall be turned from the power of Satan unto God: that's implied in those words and not only that the Jews and their Children should be returned from their Captivity in Ba|bylon, whereby this <HI>turning again from sin un|to God,</HI> h. e. that <HI>Conversion</HI> which we are speaking of, was mysteriously signified as in a Type. And in the Book of <HI>Psalms</HI> we find gracious Promises to the Children of such as fear&punc; God, <HI>Psal.</HI> 102.2 8. <HI>The Children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be estab|lished before thee,</HI> And again <HI>Psal.</HI> 128.3. <HI>Thy Children shall be like Olive plants round about thy table.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Mr. Stockton of Family Istruction p.</HI> 118.</NOTE> The Expression may import that they

shall be Comforts and Ornaments to their Pa|rents; Yea that they shall be adorned with gifts and graces of the Spirit of God. And in special, there is a promise of this Blessing with respect to Children in the Times of the Gospel, <HI>Joel</HI> 2.28. <HI>It shall come to pass after|wards,</HI> h. e. <HI>in the last dayes or times of the Gospel,</HI> as the Apostle doth expound the words <HI>I will pour my spirit upon your Children.</HI> Now these dayes wherein we live, come under the last dayes, we therefore should plead that Pro|mise before the Lord, and say, These are the last dayes, Lord, and thou hast said that in the last dayes thou wilt <HI>pour thy spirit upon the Children of thy servants.</HI> And indeed that ful|filling of the Promise which our eyes have seen is ground of Encouragement to Pray, and plead, and believe for more. Some of <HI>New-Englands</HI> Children have been eminently blessed by the Lord, He hath poured his spirit upon them richly, <HI>Plants of Renown</HI> have sprung up here, that have been the glory of the Land where they have had there Education: Yea, some that whole Nations have fared the better for them: Rivers of water have flowed out of their souls, whereby Thousands have been re|freshed; and there is a blessed Sprinkling in most Churches, though not that General pour|ing down of the Spirit that is to be desired, yet a Sprinkling which we should take notice of, for the encouragement of Faith and Prayer.
<PB N="188" REF="000393_0188_0FA5B82CB73FEBC0">
I shall only mention that which I have most reason to know; In this poor Congregation, within this few late years, there have been of Children born in New-England, near upon fourscore Persons that have come before the Church and declared what God hath done for their souls, and in that way subscribed their names to the God of Israel; besides many that have come out of other Lands, and when they have been here, the Lord hath Poured his Spirit upon them. I speak it that God might have the glory of his grace, and that Ministers may be encouraged to preach, and the Lords People to pray for the Conversion of souls. Moreover, the consideration of what Parents the Children of this Land are (many of them) sprung from, doth afford matter of encourage|ment. <HI>Paul</HI> was induced the rather to hope well concerning <HI>Timothy,</HI> because he was de|scended of such a stock; he had a Gracious Mother and a gracious grand-Mother also, 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.5. So, many Children with us, are the Off-spring of such Parents, (<HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Grand-Fathers</HI>) as have been eminent for God in their time, eminent for Holiness, yea and for Sufferings, on account of Bearing witness to the Name and truth of Christ, Now a spe|cial Blessing is wont to follow the Children of such as have been sufferers for Christ. Our Fa|thers were (some of them) eminent Confess|ors, and in a degree <HI>Martyrs of Jesus,</HI> who
<PB N="189" REF="000393_0189_0FA5B82D77FE0BA0">
left a pleasant Land and Fathers houses to fol|low the Lord into a Wilderness, in a Land which was not sown. Yea and they came hi|ther partly with respect unto their Off-spring that they might leave their Children under the special Blessing of God in Christ Jesus. Hath not the Lord peculiar Blessings in store for such Children? Let us <HI>pray them down</HI> from Heaven above.</P>
<P>Consider, 4. <HI>What a blessed thing it will be if we prevail in Heaven for this Mercy.</HI> We cannot pray for a more desirable thing than this Blessing. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>read Mr. Hookers Sermon on Hos.</HI> 10.12.</NOTE> It will help all that is amiss among us. If the Lord pour his Spirit upon the Body of the present rising generation, so as to begin a work of Conversion in those that are as yet strangers to the Power of Godliness, and to carry on that work by renewed Con|versions in the Hearts of his people, that will save us from those Judgements which other|wise there is no hope that we shall escape them. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 39.29. <HI>Neither will I hide my face any more from them</HI>: Why? <HI>for I have poured out my Spirit &mdash; saith the Lord God.</HI> And do we not, desire the Eternal as well as the Tempor|al Prosperity of our Children?

You are thoughtful what will become of your Children after you are gone out of the world. If you can but pray grace into their souls, they shall doe well enough. As that godly learned <HI>Claviger</HI> would sometimes express <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lege Clavigeri Vitam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI></NOTE> If (saith he) I may see the fear of God in my Children, <HI>Satis mihi, satis filiis et filiabus prospexi,</HI> I have then Portion enough for my sons and for my daughters, they are then sure never to want any good thing as long as they shall live. If the Lord pour out his Spirit upon our Child|ren then shall we have Joy in them indeed.

<PB N="191" REF="000393_0191_0FA5B82EF74060F0">
continue to pray for us whilest we are with them in the world. O what a blessed thing is that, for a man to have the Children that came out of his own bowels, praying for him continually A worthy Minister of Christ once said <HI>I had rather have my house filled with my Childrens prayers, then to have my house filled with gold.</HI></P>
<P>A few things by way of <HI>Direction.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let Parents be sure that they be converted themselves.</HI> Deut. 30.6. <HI>I will circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy Seed.</HI> If our own hearts be circumcised, we may pray in faith that the Lord will circumcise the hearts of our Children otherwise we cannot do it. Parents that have not Grace themselves, are not fit to pray for Grace to be poured on their Child|ren, nor indeed can they do it; for the Spirit of Supplication is the Spirit of grace, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. nor can they believe for them. An Hypocrite, or unconverted man cannot act faith for his Child's soul, who never yet did believe for his own soul. Nor doth this promise in the Text belong to other than godly Parents, Psal. 128.4. <HI>Behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Parents be Exemplary.</HI> Walk before God in your houses with a perfect heart. Let us be careful in our Families to walk so that our Children may see by our Examples how they
<PB N="192" REF="000393_0192_0FA5A88E79473540">
ought to walk and please God: that if they will but <HI>be</HI> and <HI>doe</HI> like to their Parents they shall certainly be blessed for ever. There are many of the Elect of God, that the speci|al means of their Conversion hath been the ho|ly example of their Parents. Many a Chosen vessel, that when he hath beheld his Fathers love to Christ, and Faithfulness to the Interest of God; Zeal, Patience, Holiness, that hath been a special means of Conviction and Con|version. You know what <HI>Elijah</HI> said to <HI>Elisha</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See my Brothers Sermon on</HI> 1. <HI>King.</HI> 3.57. <HI>p.</HI> 22.</NOTE> when he desired that he might have (<HI>h. e.</HI> comparitivly to what the rest of the sons of the Prophets had) a double portion of Eli|jash's Spirit, he said, <HI>Thou hast asked an hard thing, nevertheless if thou see me when I am ta|ken from thee it shall be so unto thee, but if not, it shall not be so</HI> 2. King. 2.10. Even so if your children see you holy &amp; faithful to the interest of God, and Jesus Christ, and every way ex|emplary, doubt not of it, but in Gods time, they shall receive of your Spirit. As on the other hand, there is nothing more fatally de|structive and ruining to the souls of Children than a bad example in Parents especially if they be such as pretend to Religion: When <HI>Cham</HI> did but one time see his Father in drink, it brought a fearful Curse upon him, and up|on his Posterity to this day. There are great
<PB N="193" REF="000393_0193_0FA5A889C89714D8">
Complaints (and to great Cause) concerning the <HI>rising generation</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI>; whereas the fault is very much in Parents, in that they are no more exemplary: your children take no|tice of your Pride, Sensuality, wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ldliness, your unmortified Passions, &amp; that doth wofully scan|dalize, and harden them against the blessed ways of Christ. O be careful to walk so, as that your children may not see their <HI>fathers nakedness.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let Parents be careful to instruct their child|ren in the fear of God</HI>: Prayer should be follow|ed with suitable endeavours. If Parents must pray that their Children may have Grace, they must use the means whereby God is wont to convey grace into the souls of his elect <HI>Psal.</HI> 34.11. <HI>Come ye children hearken to me and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</HI> David did so, and <HI>Solomon</HI> his son found that those Paternal in|structions were blessed for saving good to his soul, <HI>Prov.</HI> 4.1. &mdash;4. also the instructions of his Mother were (through the blessing of God) a means of much good unto him <HI>Prov.</HI> 31.1, 2.

<P N="4">4. <HI>Wait on the Lord</HI>: Tho' the answer do not come presently yet continue praying and belie|ving and let nothing discourage you: say not I have pray'd for my Childrens souls, but no grace no change wrought in them, and now I am e'ne hopeless and faithless: Remember the woman of <HI>Canaan,</HI> she cried to the Lord Jesus for her poor child and yet had repulses one after another, the Lord not seeming to regard her, this was to try her faith; at last.
