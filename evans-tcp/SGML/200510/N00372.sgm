<HEAD>AN APPEAL To the Men of <HI>New England,</HI> with a short Account of Mr. <HI>Randolphs</HI> PAPERS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the Unhappiness of this present Juncture, that too many Men relinquish their Stations of <HI>Privacy</HI> and <HI>Subjection,</HI> and take upon them too freely to descant upon affairs of the <HI>Publick</HI>; and those generally <HI>such</HI> as have manifestly no <HI>Love</HI> for, nor <HI>Interest</HI> in the welfare of this Country, who yet assume a strange liberty to themselves of justifying the Conduct of the late Usurping Govern|ment, and censuring the Justice and Order of the late Revolution; and by clandestine Libells, and open Coffee-house talks, endeavour to sow <HI>Factions</HI> and <HI>Divisions</HI> among us. It has been therefore thought fit (in order to the unity of the People, and healing the present discomposures) to propose the insuing <HI>Queries</HI> and <HI>Cases,</HI> upon which 'tis desired every man would exercise his faculty of judging, that hereby he may know how to encounter the <HI>Sophistries</HI> and stop the mouthes of these pestilent <HI>Gain-sayers.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>1.</HI> Of the Injury done to our Charter.</HEAD>
<P>Whether the Charters of <HI>New-England</HI> were not invaded and va|cated in pursuance of the very same ends that caused the General Attempt lately made upon the Charters throughout all the <HI>English Dominions</HI>?</P>
<P>Whether the Destruction of the <HI>English Charters</HI> were not one of the most considerable Branches of the late <HI>Popish Plot,</HI> for the subver|sion and utter extinction of the Protestant Religion?</P>
<P>Whether it be rational to suppose that our late Superiours at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> did receive or could propose any advantage by the over|throw of our Charter-Government but only to bring us within the reach of <HI>Popish Counsels,</HI> when it should be time for them to work upon us?</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000455_0002_0FA5B2B097218628" MS="y">Whether (supposing our <HI>Charters</HI> forfeitable) we had forfeited them by breaking any one Article or Condition in them?</P>
<P>Whether therefore the late Conspirators in the Court at <HI>White-Hall</HI> did not rob us in the <HI>Massachusets Colony</HI> of our Charter, by first letting fall their <HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> when we had sent Agents to stand a Trial at Law; and then by issuing out a Writ of <HI>Scire fa|cias</HI> against us, requiring us to appear suddenly after at <HI>Westminster</HI> and so entring Judgment against us for our non-appearance, whilst in the mean time it was perfectly impossible we should have any timely notice of it?</P>
<P>VVhether it be not a great Article in the Declaration publisht by his Highness the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>&punc; concerning the Reasons of his Discent into <HI>England, That all Magistrates who have been unjustly turned out, shall forthwith Reassume their former Imployments and the English Corporations return to their ancient Prescriptions &amp; Charters</HI>?</P>
<P>VVhether <HI>Connecticut</HI> died not as a <HI>Fool Dieth,</HI> and were not baub|led out of their Charter, and whether they are not more knaves than fools, who would go about to make them <HI>twice dead,</HI> when not only their <HI>Charter</HI> was actually restored by the Proclamation of King <HI>James,</HI> but also his present Majesty has declared (as we have undoubted information) <HI>That their Charter is as Good as ever</HI>?</P>
<P>VVhether we have not Received an Attested Copy of a Bill past in the House of <HI>Commons,</HI> which expresly Declares, <HI>That the Pro|ceedings against our Charter were Illegal, and a Grievance?</HI></P>
<P>VVhether notwithstanding the sence of all <HI>England</HI> Assembled in a full and free Parliament to the contrary, we should not rather lick up the Spittle of some of our Learned Jayl-birds, who ever now and then spawn a Pamphet to tell us, <HI>That we have been fairly dealt with</HI>?</P>
<P>Whether when 'tis considered that for the meer hope sake of a lasting Peace and Settlement under the protections and priviledges of our <HI>Charters,</HI> we have with an incredible expence and labour
<PB N="3" REF="000455_0003_0FA5B2B170DEAA78">
subdued a dismal <HI>Wilderness</HI> into a famous, &amp; flourishing <HI>Teritory,</HI> of no small advantage to the Crown of <HI>England</HI>; we may expect that it will be thought just and fair for us to be deprived of those Privi|ledges and Injoyments by which we were hereunto decoy'd and ruined by the miseries of an Arbitrary Government?</P>
<P>Whether upon the little glimmering prospect which we now have of our being freed from the wretched circumstances under which we laboured by the loss of our <HI>Charter-Priviledges,</HI> we may not be allowed to wear a little joy in our faces, and return thanks to our God, the Soveraign Bestower of all the good we have in Possession or Expectation?</P>
<P>Whether if our late <HI>President</HI> should make it appear, either that he did not contribute to the loss of our <HI>Charter,</HI> or that he has a just and due regret for doing it, this might not reconcile him to the af|fections of the people, of which among so many that have desired to see him <HI>humbled,</HI> so few desire to see him <HI>ruined</HI>?</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>2.</HI> Of the Commission by which we were lately Governed.</HEAD>
<P>Whether the late <HI>Commission</HI> by which the late Government was imposed upon us, did not deny us the <HI>Common Rights,</HI> which all <HI>En|glish men</HI> justly count themselves born unto, and entirely subject <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that was dear to us unto the <HI>Arbitrary Disposal</HI> of five or six men, that shewed their manifest hatred to whatsoever <HI>N-England</HI> loved?</P>
<P>Whether if indeed by our being here, we become <HI>Slaves,</HI> and are to be utterly excluded from all interest in making of <HI>Laws,</HI> and raising of <HI>Taxes,</HI> but what is in the <HI>submitting</HI> and <HI>smarting</HI> part of them we had not better agree to break up the Plantation, and march some for <HI>England</HI> again?</P>
<P>Whether those People who now declare for the continuance of that <HI>Commission,</HI> do not therein (some ignorantly, some maliciously) <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">bets <HI>Treason,</HI> and the worst of <HI>Treasons</HI> against the <HI>Liberties</HI> of the <HI>English Nation,</HI> and make themselves parties to the worst Enemies of their Countrey?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000455_0004_0FA5B2B236188E78">Whether they were persons inconsiderable for Note or Number which did call our late Government by the name of a <HI>French-Go|vernment,</HI> and counted it an Essay or Specimen of what was intend|ed for the whole <HI>English Nation?</HI></P>
<P>Whether any good man has done any other than buy Repentance at a dear rate by espousing the Interests, or gratifying the humours of the men that so lately Lorded over us!</P>
<P>Whether common Cursing and Swearing and Sabbath-breaking be not admirable qualities in a <HI>Governour,</HI> and such as may make a|ny <HI>New-Englanders</HI> dote upon him, or endeavour his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, when we have all the assurance in the world that we shall be commended by the Authority of <HI>England</HI> for our deposing him?</P>
<P>Whether when a <HI>Governour</HI> has made his allowed Knot of <HI>Coun|sellors</HI> competently drunk at his <HI>Bouts</HI> with them after midnight, they be not in a fine pickle to manage the Government of this large Territory, which no doubt now perishes for the want of such <HI>Su|per-sober Counsellors</HI>?</P>
<P>Whether those people who now afflict themselves with a Bodily fear that a <HI>mean</HI> person may now and then get into the place of a <HI>Magistrate</HI> among us, have not forgotten, what sort of <HI>Gentlemen</HI> were among our late <HI>Counsellors?</HI> And whether they know the O|riginal of our late <HI>boysterous Deputy Governour,</HI> who in very good time informed us, That <HI>the Scabbard of a Red-coat should quickly sig|nifie as much as the Commission of a Justice of the Peace</HI>?</P>
<P>What were the <HI>Qualifications</HI> which were counted enough to make a man capable of a <HI>Place</HI> in the late Administration?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>3.</HI> Of the Opression which was used every day upon us in our Civil Concerns</HEAD>
<P>Whether some of the principal Gentlemen concerned in the late Government have not once and again ingeniously Confest, <HI>That the Government was become Intollerable?</HI></P>
<P>Whether those that <HI>Rob</HI> on the <HI>Road,</HI> or in the night under the

fear of Hanging are not honest Robbers in comparison of them that <HI>Rob</HI> in the capacity of <HI>Lawyers,</HI> by making the Law it self out a Fool to manage the designs of Robbery?</P>
<P>Whether any man alive can tell what <HI>Law</HI> our late Masters were pleased to Govern by.</P>
<P>Whether amongst many other injuries which the <HI>Fermentations</HI> of the last <HI>April</HI> did unto several honest people, this be not one, that certain pickt, settled and Standing Officers (but no Free hol|ders) called <HI>Jury-men,</HI> were thereby dismist from their places, which we thought they must have held <HI>Durante Vit&acirc;,</HI> by a Lease for their Lives?</P>
<P>Whether in one and the same Crime, sometimes the <HI>Old Law</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> was not that which did convict the fault, and the <HI>new Law</HI> of <HI>Old-England,</HI> that which did adjust the Fine?</P>
<P>Whether we did not with a very singular Edification, and Satis|faction hear our late courteous Rulers very gravely hold forth un|to us, that, <HI>It was not for His Majesties Interest that we should thrive</HI>?</P>
<P>Whether the usage of the <HI>Ipswich Men,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Men were not so just and kind that they ought never to forget it? or whether a peaceable desiring, that we might have liberty for an <HI>Assembly</HI> before we Rais'd <HI>Taxes</HI>; or whether Begging Mony to carry on a Tryal at <HI>Law</HI> for <HI>Town-lands</HI> injuriously invaded, were an inexpia|ble <HI>Treason?</HI></P>
<P>What was <HI>Major Appleton</HI> put, and kept in Prison, and denyed an <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> for?</P>
<P>And for what were <HI>Major Saltonstal</HI> and <HI>Mr. Bradstreet,</HI> and o|thers Imprisoned and put to a strange Cost and Charge.</P>
<P>How many times have the <HI>Excise-men</HI> gone unto honest and courteous Houses in the Country, pretending themselves ill, and so procuring the Civilities that good people use to treat Strangers with, but thereupon dropt a three-pence, or sixpence in a by place of the House, and then sworn that they bought drink there; and
<PB N="6" REF="000455_0006_0FA5B2B38CDCDCA8">
how many times has this Trick been play'd upon persons that ne|ver sold a drop of drink in their lives? Who clapt these Knaves on the Back, and held them by the Chin in these Rogueries? Who went Ships with them?</P>
<P>Whether Mr. <HI>Morton</HI> the very Reverend, and no less peaceable Minister of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> were not by Governour <HI>Andross</HI>s furious Command (contrary to the declared Sense of two of the <HI>Judges</HI> upon the Bench) drag'd out of his own County, to be Try'd for Seditious Preaching, on purpose because he thought no place but <HI>Boston</HI> could afford a Jury wicked enough to ruine him, on the Te|stimony of one single Debaucht Person, contradicted by the whole Assembly that heard the Sermon?</P>
<P>What was the <HI>true</HI> Reason why no Town might meet to Transact any <HI>Parish-business,</HI> above once a Year?</P>
<P>VVhether it was not both verbally and really deny'd by the late Usurpers here, that any man in the Colony own'd so much as one Foot of <HI>Land</HI>? And so after all the vast Treasure and Labour which we had spent to provide for our selves a Livelihood in a Wilderness, had not we brought our <HI>Hogs</HI> (and all our other <HI>Cat|tle</HI> too) to a fair Market?</P>
<P>VVhether it were possible for all the mony and Movables in <HI>New-England</HI> to have paid the prizes that must have been exacted for the <HI>Patents,</HI> which we were now obliged to take for our <HI>Own Lands,</HI> even as they are stated in the Fees of the <HI>Secretaries</HI> Office?</P>
<P>VVhether a certain person divers ways endear'd to our late Gang of <HI>Mony-catchers,</HI> having of his own a Spot of Land, worth not a|bove Two Hundred Pounds, was not at last forced to offer Fifty Pounds for a <HI>Patent</HI> for it, and yet after all could not get it so, be|cause (forsooth) a Neighbour offered to give more for a <HI>good Ti|tle</HI> to it.</P>
<P>How many Hundred Acres of other mens <HI>Lands</HI> have been beg|ged by <HI>Counsellors,</HI> out of their singular and <HI>fatherly</HI> Affection to
<PB N="7" REF="000455_0007_0FA5B2B481C01AD8">
the Country? and who must have maintained the scores of VVi|dows and Orphans, that must have been brought to <HI>beg</HI> their <HI>bread,</HI> whilst others <HI>beg'd</HI> their <HI>Lands</HI>?</P>
<P>VVhether when some certain Widows that had their Lands ta|ken from them, pleaded with these publick Thieves, and urg'd on them, <HI>That God would one day plead the cause of the Widows,</HI> they were not scoffingly bid <HI>to stay till that day come?</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>4.</HI> Of the Persecution which our Sacred Concerns were assaulted with.</HEAD>
<P>VVhether <HI>Jefferies</HI> the late Lord <HI>Chancellor</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> or some body else, advised no body, <HI>To Ruine these Churches as fast as he could yet not to do it by force&punc; but to Sap them by starving the Mi|nisters every where from their Imployments, upon which their Churches will by consequence fall of themselves</HI>; and whether fine steps were not taken in the practice of this Advice?</P>
<P>VVhether in the ordinary Dispensations of Justice among us, if a person accused of any Crime, were a vicious profligate blasphe|mous Fellow, he were not likely to have all possible favour shown him, but if he were a serious, holy, Good Man, he might not expect the utmost rigour, that the extent of their sence of the Law could inflict on him?</P>
<P>VVhether the pious Christians in <HI>New-England</HI> had not some cause at least why their Consciences might scruple the <HI>mode</HI> of Swearing <HI>on the Book,</HI> when the <HI>Common Law</HI> which is the onely Law pretended for it in this Case does in all old Presidents, inter|pret a Swearing ON to be a Swearing BY the Gospels, and we have long thought it sinful to swear <HI>by</HI> any <HI>Creatures</HI>?</P>
<P>VVhether some of the Justices themselves in their giving of <HI>Oaths</HI> did not awaken our thoughts by making the poor people Swear <HI>By the Holy Evangelists,</HI> concluding the Oath with <HI>so help you God&punc; and his holy Evangelists?</HI> And whether when a man was prosecuted for Perjury, the form of his Indictment did not run, <HI>That he did perjuriously on the Holy Evangelists of the Almighty God

Depose,</HI> &amp;c? And whether yet even the Homiles of the Church of <HI>England</HI> do not teach us, That to say, <HI>So help me God, and Saint John,</HI> is Idolatry?</P>
<P>Whether many of the best People in the Country were not Fined and Imprisoned meerly for scrupling to Swear <HI>on the Book,</HI> though they readily offered to Swear <HI>with an Vplifted Hand</HI>?</P>
<P>VVhether the least affront offered unto them that were so scru|pulous were not to put them by from Serving on a <HI>Jury,</HI> or as a <HI>Witness</HI>? And whether the bottom of this intreague were not chiefly to render the <HI>Largest</HI> the most <HI>sober,</HI> and <HI>valuable</HI> part of the Country uncapable of any <HI>Interest</HI> in the passage of <HI>Justice</HI> be|tween man and man? And whether <HI>some folks</HI> would not have had then a brave time on't?</P>
<P>VVhether those very <HI>Judges,</HI> who punisht holy and worthy men, for only scrupling a <HI>mode</HI> of Swearing, ever did or durst pu|nish a <HI>Quaker</HI> for not Swearing at all?</P>
<P>VVhether those very Oppressors who would not permit the <HI>New-Englanders</HI> to retain their old Rites in Swearing, did not allow <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> under the same Government to Swear with <HI>Vplifted Hands</HI> according to their ancient Mode?</P>
<P>VVhether none of our late Superiours had cause to know that in the island of <HI>Guernsey,</HI> and <HI>Jersey,</HI> which are under the Crown of <HI>England</HI> it be not according to Common Law (because Anci|ent Custom) to Swear with <HI>Lifting up the Hand</HI>?</P>
<P>Whether although it seem a <HI>small Truth</HI> for which the good peo|ple have suffered his malicious and unreasonable Persecution, yet the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Cause do not rather augment and commend the <HI>Fidelity</HI> of the Sufferers?</P>
<P>Whether the late <HI>wise Justices</HI> did not affirm all the Ecclesiastical <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">-Laws against Nonconformists to be in force against us, when they so vigorously prosecuted that worthy Minister Mr. <HI>Mather the Younger</HI> for Publishing (before Sir <HI>Edmond Andross</HI> arrived

here) a modest and placid Discourse giving the Reasons of our Dissent from the Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England</HI>?

And whether, when they had the power of bind|ing &amp; loosing the <HI>Press,</HI> it had not been more sasisfactory for them to have answered it by Scripture and reason or any way rather than by a ruinous <HI>Romish</HI> Prosecution?</P>
<P>Whether when 'twas argu'd, that it would be a very unfair thing to punish the <HI>Noncon's</HI> in this Countrey, for not using the Service of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> while the Countrey had scarce any but <HI>Noncon's</HI> in it&punc; and so every man almost in the Land must pay at least 12 <HI>l</HI> a day (be|sides other far greater penalties) which with Sundayes and Holydayes would amount to four pounds a man by the year, for not being present at the <HI>Common Prayer</HI> Worship, that Justice had not more of the <HI>Wolf</HI> than the <HI>Fox</HI> in him, who reply'd, <HI>We are in a way to bring it to that extremity</HI>?</P>
<P>Whether when the late Kings <HI>Declaration</HI> for liberty of Conscience, gave us hopes of deliverance from an approaching Persecution, the Min|isters of <HI>Boston</HI> having agreed with their Congregations to keep a day of Thanksgiving to God for that Mercy, Governour <HI>Andross</HI> did not send for them the night before the day intended, and with many menaces, bid them keep the day at their peril, and tell them he would send Souldiers to guard their Churches and them too? and yet having thus put by the day, to the great scandal and offence of the whole Town, had he not the face to deny afterwards that ever he had forbidden it?</P>

<HEAD><HI>6.</HI> Of the Revolution.</HEAD>

I will engage with Five Hundred of His Majesties Guard to <HI>drive</HI> them out of their <HI>Country.</HI> &mdash; As for all the persons joyn'd, and concerned in the <HI>Faction</HI> here, I know but one man, who was not himself a Servant, or a Servants Son.</P>

<P>If that great body of People by mis-understanding be once <HI>broken</HI> and <HI>disperst</HI> into the Southern Plantations, the <HI>French</HI> will certainly by degrees swallow up that great Country planted, and possest by His Majesties Subjects now above these sixty Years, and so at length be|come Masters of all His Majesties <HI>VVest-India</HI> Plantations, which by the benefit and advantage of those many Harbours in that Country may be obtained.</P>

<P>If His Majesties Laws (which none but Phanaticks question) be of force with us, we could raise a sufficient maintenance for di|vers Ministers out of the <HI>Estates</HI> of those whose <HI>Treasons</HI> have <HI>forfeited</HI> them to His Majesty.</P>

<P>In my Attendance on your <HI>Lordship,</HI> I often prest that some able Ministers might be appointed to perform the Offices of the Church with us. The main obstacle was, how they should be maintained? I did formerly and do now propose that a part of that Money sent over hither and pretended to be expended among the <HI>Indians,</HI> may be ordered to go towards that Charge. &mdash; As for &mdash; he is one of the <HI>Faction,</HI> a man of mean Extraction, coming over a poor Servant; as most of the <HI>Faction</HI> were at their first Planting here, but by extraordinary zeal and cousenage, have got them great Estates in <HI>Land;</HI> so that if His Majesty <HI>Fine</HI> them sufficiently (and well if they scape so) they can go to work to get more.</P>

would come over to us. But some being Trades-men&punc; others of Me|chanick Professions, are threatned by the <HI>Congregational Men</HI> to be Arrested by their Creditors, or to be turned out of their work, if they come to our Church. &mdash; I have taken care to inform my self how the Mony sent over hither for the Company of <HI>Evangelizing Indians</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> is disposed of; Here are seven persons called <HI>Commissioners,</HI> or Trustees, who have the sole manage of it&punc; The chief of which are Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> our President a man of a base servile and Antimonarchical Principle; Mr. <HI>Stoughton</HI>&punc; of the old Leven; Mr. <HI>Richards,</HI> a man not to be trusted in publick busi|ness; Mr. <HI>Hinkly,</HI> a Rigid Independant, and others like to these. &mdash; I humbly presume to Remind your Grace of your promise to me when in <HI>England;</HI> that a Commission should be directed to some persons here unconcerned to Audit, and report their Accounts of that Mony &mdash; We want good Schoolmasters, none here being allowed of but of <HI>ill Principles;</HI> The mony now converted unto private or worse Vses&punc; will set up good and publick Schools, and provide a maintenance for our Ministers who now lives upon a small Contribu|tion.</P>

<P>This barbarous people were never civilly treated by the late Go|vernment, who made it their business to encroach upon their Lands, and by degrees to drive them out of all, That was the Ground and Beginning of the last War.
