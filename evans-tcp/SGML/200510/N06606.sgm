<P>_WE embark'd on board the Tran&s;port <HI>Harwood,</HI> bound on the Expedition to <HI>Canada.</HI>&mdash; The 4th Day we &s;et Sail for the River St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> which we made on the 9th Day, and there we lay 'til the 16th, before we got into the River; which is very wide and moun|tainous. For about forty Leagues up the River the Depth of Water is 100 Fathoms. The 16th Day we came into &s;eventeen-fathom Water; and on the 23d we join'd Admiral <HI>Durell,</HI> who had 7 Sail of the Line, with &s;ome Frigates with him, which lay as a Guard to protect the River, at a Place call'd the I&s;land of <HI>Coudre.</HI>&mdash;This I&s;land is plea&s;antly &s;ituated, lies partly high, and was very well peopled before we came up:&mdash;And pa&s;&s;ing this I&s;land about a League up, we anchor'd, and two of our Boats went in Shore and was attack'd by a

<P>The 25th we made the out End of the I&s;land of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and on the 27th we landed on it without the lo&s;s of a Man.&mdash;A &s;mall Party of Rangers were almo&s;t &s;ur|rounded by a large Party of <HI>Indians</HI>; but the Rangers ru&s;h'd through them with the Lo&s;s of only one Man; what Damage the Enemy &s;u&s;tain'd is uncertain.</P>
<P>On the 29th the <HI>French</HI> &s;ent five Fire-Ships down among our Fleet; but, thank God, they did no Damage.

<P><HI>July</HI> the 5th, a Barge came between the I&s;land and the main Land, to &s;ound the Depth of Water: The <HI>French</HI> fir'd four Cannon-Shot at her, and came down on a large Bar of Sand, from whence they fir'd &s;mall Arms; al&s;o five Canoes came down the River, loaded with <HI>Indians,</HI> who took the Barge, made one Man Pri&s;oner, and wounded another belonging to the 22d Regiment.

<P>The third Day our Shipping was drove off by the Enemy's Shells.&mdash;We got only &s;ome few Pri&s;oners, 'til the 12th Day, when the <HI>French</HI> built a Battery again&s;t us, but had not Time to mount any Guns on it; for we &s;oon demoli&s;h'd it with our Field-Pieces and Hauitzers.

A De&s;erter came to us, from whom we had in imperfect Account of their Forces; which, however, gave us &s;ome Encourage|ment.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 18th, the De&s;erter went out with our Light-Infantry, to &s;how them a Place where to cro&s;s the Falls; the <HI>Indians</HI> fir'd on them, but hurt none: Likewise the &s;ame Night &s;ome of our Shipping pa&s;s'd the Town, and one run a&s;hore on the South Side of the River.

<P><HI>July</HI> 22d we &s;et the Town on Fire, which burnt all the next Day: Some of our Shipping went to pa&s;s the Town; but they fir'd &s;o hot, that they were ob|lig'd to turn back.</P>

that carries Arms; but that there was a great Number of Women and Chil|dren, that they were very &s;cant of Provi|vi&s;ions; likewi&s;e that he him&s;elf had been 48 Hours without any Thing to eat: He further &s;aid, that the Enemy were very numerous in their Intrenchments, con&s;i&s;t|ing of at lea&s;t 14,000 Men, of which 11,000 were <HI>Canadians</HI> and the re&s;t Re|gulars, the latter of whom were heartily tir'd with the Siege.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 6th the Schooner <HI>Terror of France</HI> went above the Town, in the middle of the Day, as &s;he pa&s;s'd they kept up a con|&s;tant Fire at her, and &s;he receiv'd five of their Shot; one in her Jib, two in her Main&s;ail and 2 in her Fore&s;ail; but lo&s;t none of her Hands, nor did &s;he &s;u&s;tain any further Damage.</P>
<P>The whole Army being on Point-<HI>Levee</HI> Side, the main Body were order'd to get ready to march above the Town, on the South Side, and to take only one Shirt and one Pair of Stockings, be&s;ides what we had on: We marched up the River about 8 Miles, and then embarked on board the Men of War and Tran&s;ports that were up the River; the Number that embark|ed

was 3349 Men, with a Party of the Train of Artillery.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 10. the Weather being very wet, and the Troops very much crowded on board the Men of War and Tran&s;ports, the General thought proper to land us on the South Side again; which was a great Decoy to the <HI>French:</HI> We marched to the Church of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> under the Command of General <HI>Monckton,</HI> where we halted. The next Day we received Intelligence of a &s;mall Number of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> who were driving &s;ome Cat|tle;&mdash;we di&s;patched a Party of 500 Men, who took the Cattle, but the Enemy got off.</P>
<P>The 12th we received Orders to em|bark on board our Ships again.</P>
<P>The 13th we had Orders to land; &s;o we fell down the River in the Ships and Boats till we came a little above the Town, where the Enemy lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected us (for where the Enemy thought we &s;hould have landed, they had about 600 Hor&s;e; but what Number of Foot we could not &s;ay; we could perceive that they was intrench'd and had 5 Floating-Batteries to intercept our Landing)</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="008381_0020_102F437F94C81D38">On the 14th we landed, at break of Day, and immediately attacked and rout|ed the Enemy, taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Bat|tery of 424-Pounders, and one thirteen Inch Mortar, with but an incon&s;iderable Lo&s;s. We then took Po&s;t on the Plains of <HI>Abraham,</HI> whither M. <HI>Montcalm</HI> (on hearing that we had landed, for he did not expect us) ha&s;ted with his whole Ar|my (con&s;i&s;ting of Cavalry as well as In|fantry) to give us Battle; about 9 o'Clock we ob&s;erved the Enemy marching down towards us in three Columns, at 10 they formed their Line of Battle, which was at lea&s;t &s;ix deep, having their Flanks cover|ed by a thick Wood on each Side, into which they threw above 3000 <HI>Canadians</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> who gauled us much; the Regulars then marched briskly up to us, and gave us their fir&s;t Fire, at about Fifty Yards Di&s;tance, which we did not return, as it was General <HI>Wolfe</HI>'s expre&s;s Orders not to fire till they came within twenty Yards of us&mdash;They continued firing by Platoons, advancing in a very regular Manner till they came clo&s;e up to us, and then the Action became general: In about a Quarter of an Hour the Enemy gave

The Enemy lo&s;t in the Engagement, Lieut. Gen. <HI>Montcalm,</HI> (who was torn to Pieces by our Grape-Shot) 2 Brigadier-Generals; one Colonel; 2 Lieutenant-Colonels; and at lea&s;t 1300 Officers and Men kill'd, and 200 taken Pri&s;oners at their very Sally-Ports, of which 58 were Officers:&mdash;On our Side was killed the brave and never to be forgotten Ge|neral WOLFE; with 9 Officers, 4 Ser|jeants and 44 Privates; wounded, Briga|dier-General <HI>Monckton</HI>; Colonel <HI>Carlton,</HI> Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General; Major <HI>Barre,</HI> Adjutant-General; and 50 other Officers, with 26 Serjeants and 557 Privates.&mdash;This Action was the more glorious, as the E|nemy were at lea&s;t 12,000 &s;trong, be&s;ides 500 Hor&s;e; whereas we, at the utmo&s;t, did not con&s;i&s;t of above 3500, &s;ome of whom did not engage;&mdash;for at the Time of the Engagement Colonel <HI>Scott</HI> was out burning the Country with 1600 Men; Col. <HI>Burton</HI> was at Point-<HI>Levee</HI> with 2000

<P>At Ten o'Clock at Night we &s;urpriz'd their Guard and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Grand Ho&s;pital, wherein we found be|tween 12 and 1500 Sick and Wounded.</P>
<P>We lay on our Arms all Night, and in the Morning we &s;ecured the Bridge of Boats which the Enemy had over <HI>Charles</HI> River, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed our&s;elves of all the Po&s;ts and Avenues that was or might be of any Con&s;equence leading to the Town&punc; and broke Ground at 100 Yards Di&s;tance from the Walls; we likewi&s;e got up 12 heavy 24-Pounders; &s;ix heavy Twelve-Pounders, &s;ome large Mortars, and the 4 8-inch Hauitzers, to play upon the Town, and we had been employed three Days, intending to make a Breach, and &s;torm the City Sword in Hand, but we were prevented by their beating a Parley, and &s;ending out a Flag of Truce with Articles of Capitu|lation, and the next Day, being the 17th of <HI>September,</HI> we took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the City, where we found 250 Pieces of Can|non, a Number of Mortars, from 9 to
