<P>THE Belief of a GOD and a Provi|dence, certainly lies at the Foun|dation of all Religion; and as Reli|gion was de&s;igned, by our all-wi&s;e Creator, to be the main Bu&s;ine&s;s of human Life, there is accordingly no Truth capable of more &s;trict Demon&s;tration than this; that there is a &s;upream Spirit, who is the grand Superintendant of the Univer&s;e, &amp; over-rules in every Event. This Propo&s;ition, therefore, I &s;hall take for granted, in the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e; as I hope there is no Per&s;on in this A&s;&s;embly, who doubts it.</P>
<P>Wherever we turn our Eyes, we behold evident Traces of Infinite Wi&s;dom, Power, and Goodne&s;s, the Perfections of the Deity &s;hining in his Works; and there are, frequently, mar|velous interpo&s;itions of Divine Providence;
<PB N="6" REF="008560_0004_102F82A3F4347C98">
which, it would be, in the highe&s;t Degree, &s;tupid in us, not to perceive; &amp; ungrateful, not to acknowledge. All of us, who have lived any con&s;iderable Time upon Earth, mu&s;t needs recollect many critical Sea&s;ons of their Lives, when they have been pre&s;erved in mo&s;t imminent Dangers, by the immediate Hand of GOD; and plucked as Brands out of the Burn|ing. And, no doubt, the wonderful Di&s;co|veries of another Day, will point us to many more &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing In&s;tances of unbounded Grace, which we are not now con&s;cious to. I cannot but imagine that there are many Things of this Nature, which we know not now, but &s;hall know hereafter; and that this con&s;titutes one principal Part of the Entertain|ment of the glorified Spirits above; to review the&s;e critical Sea&s;ons, in all their Circum&s;tances; and adore their Almighty Guardian, with rap|turous Thank&s;givings.&mdash;Sea&s;ons, in which, if Matters had not happened exactly as they did, by a my&s;terious Concurrence of &s;econd Cau&s;es, influenced by Him who con&s;tantly guides and animates the whole; (by him alone, without any Forethought, or A&s;&s;i&s;tance of theirs; nay, in &s;ome In&s;tances, contrary to their Wi&s;hes and Expectations) they mu&s;t inevitably have been mi&s;erable through all their Pilgrimage upon Earth, and perhaps to all Eternity.</P>
<P>But if the Finger of GOD is thus vi&s;ible in all the minute Incidents of human Life; if he
<PB N="7" REF="008560_0005_102F82A88FD69890">
graciou&s;ly con&s;ults the Happine&s;s of every In|dividual, determines the Times before appoint|ed, and the Bounds of his Habitation; if the Hairs of our Head are all accurately numbred, and not a Sparrow falls to the Ground without our heavenly Father; certainly he is not an idle Spectator of the more important Tran&s;actions of the Globe, the Tumults of the People, the Revolution of States &amp; Kingdoms. No;&mdash;He does his Sovereign Plea&s;ure among the Armies of Heaven above, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth beneath; and it becomes us to re|gard the Work of the LORD, and to con&s;ider the Operation of his Hands. The Kingdom is the LORDS, and He is the Governor among the Nations. He blows the Trumpet, and they are rou&s;ed to univer&s;al Battle: He waves the Olive Branch, and they are lulled in profound Peace.</P>
<P>When he plea&s;es, he elevates the mo&s;t de|te&s;table of Mankind to the Pinnacle of human Glory; the Di&s;grace of their Species, and the Scourge of their unhappy Subjects. When he plea&s;es, he di&s;appoints the haughty Tyrant, in the mid&s;t of his ambitious Enterpri&s;es; depo&s;es him from his exalted Station; and da&s;hes him to Pieces, as a Potter's Ve&s;&s;el. When he plea&s;es, he places upon the Throne a Man of an excellent Spirit; gives Wi&s;dom to his Coun|&s;els, and vigor to his Arms; pre&s;erves his inva|luable Life, prevents him with the Ble&s;&s;ings of Goodne&s;s, and &s;ets a Crown of pure Gold upon his Head; makes him the Terror of his Ene|mies,
<PB N="8" REF="008560_0006_102F82AA236EF410">
and the Protector of his People. The proud <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> and the amiable <HI>Cyrus,</HI> are equally his Servants, and &s;ubject to his Con|troul; and, when he plea&s;es, the abandoned <HI>Saul</HI> mu&s;t fall a Sacrifice to his ju&s;t Vengeance; that the devout <HI>David,</HI> the Man after his own Heart, may take the Charge of his di&s;tingui&s;h'd <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;way the Scepter in Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>He overules in all the various Revolutions of an Earthly Court; manages the minute Springs, which actuate the Wheels of Govern|ment; and influences the un&s;earchable Heart of Kings. Sometimes, for wi&s;e and holy Ends, He permits a corrupt Mini&s;ter to obtain the Favour of his Sovereign, pre&s;ide in the Cabinet, and &s;it at the Helm of Government; permits him to abu&s;e the Confidence, and betray the Intere&s;ts of his Royal Ma&s;ter; to embezzle the public Revenue, and prey upon the Bowels of the Con&s;titution; to maintain a clande&s;tine Corre&s;pondence with the open Enemies of his Country; to receive Bribes and Pen&s;ions from a foreign Court; and to triumph, perhaps, for a long Cour&s;e of Years, in the Succe&s;s of his treacherous and arbitrary Schemes; while the contemptible Tools of his Power grow rich with Rapine and Oppre&s;&s;ion, the wicked walk on every &s;ide, and the vile&s;t of Men are ex|alted. When he plea&s;es he rai&s;es up an hone&s;t Patriot, in&s;pired with Sentiments of Virtue, who acts perpetually from the noble&s;t Princi|ples, de&s;pi&s;es the Gain of Oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ha|keth
<PB N="9" REF="008560_0007_102F82ABB7ACE630">
his Hands from Holding of Bribes; animates him with a public Spirit, and a warm Affection to his bleeding Country; furni&s;hes him with an exten&s;ive Capacity, and what is &s;till more valuable, an uncorrupted Heart; enlarges his Influence, and &s;ucceeds his Mea|&s;ures; makes him, at once, the Darling of his Prince, and the Favourite of a flouri&s;hing Nation; while his Eyes are upon the Faith|ful of the Land, that they may dwell with him, and he is &s;erved by &s;uch as walk in a perfect Way. So the infamous <HI>Haman</HI> was bru&s;hed from the Pre&s;ence of King <HI>Aba&s;ue|rus,</HI> and received the ju&s;t Demerit of his Crimes; that the upright <HI>Mordecai</HI> might &s;uc|ceed him, accepted of the Multitude of his Brethren, &s;eeking the Wealth of his People, and &s;peaking Peace to all his Seed.</P>
<P>But let us leave the Confinement of the Court, extend our Views, and take a Survey of the Warlike Field; covered with regular Encampments, furrowed with Trenches, or glittering with ho&s;tile Arms. There we be|hold the re&s;olute Troops in their intrepid March; the gallant Commanders levelling the de&s;tructive In&s;truments of Death; and the gilded Banners, unfurled, and waving in the Wind. Suddenly, the gay Scene vani&s;hes from our Eyes; all is enveloped in Smoke, and Flame, and Sulphur. Hark! how con|fu&s;ed the Din of the Battle, the Thunder of
<PB N="10" REF="008560_0008_102F82AF70F50CF0">
the Captains, and the Shouting; while the Groans of the Vanqui&s;hed, and the Acclama|tions of the Conqueror, and all the horrid Di&s;|cord of War, rore thro' the Valley, and are echoed from the neighbouring Hills! Anon, the Noi&s;e abates, the Smoke di&s;&s;ipates, and what a gha&s;tly Spectacle is exhibited to our View! the mo&s;t vigorous and athletick Bo|dies, with their brawney Limbs, once the Terror of the Mighty in the Land of the Liv|ing; but now, pale, bloody, and &s;cattered promi&s;cuous&punc; Thou&s;ands and ten Thou&s;ands, Heaps upon Heaps, cover the Plain, and compleat the Carnage. And is not the Al|mighty Hand &s;till con&s;picuous? &s;hould we not acknowledge and adore it? 'Tis He alone who can give the Victory, and determine the dubious Conte&s;t, when the Fate of an Empire hangs in Su&s;pence, and waits for the Deci&s;ion of an Hour. When he plea&s;es he can &s;catter a Panick thro' the brave&s;t Troops, and infa|tuate an Army of the mo&s;t experienced Vete|rans. 'Tis He who directs the military Coun|&s;els, and &s;teels the Heart of the &s;ucce&s;sful General. Every de&s;cending Sword is guided by Him, and every random Shot executes his Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He can level the proude&s;t Cities, demoli&s;h their lofty Bulwarks, and lay low the Haugh|tine&s;s of the Terrible. At his &s;overeign Nod,
<PB N="11" REF="008560_0009_102F82B272F5D660">
the Walls of <HI>Jericho</HI> mu&s;t fall down pro&s;trate, and pave a Path for the conquering <HI>Jo&s;hua.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis He al&s;o who reigns LORD of the bound|le&s;s Ocean, holds the Winds in His Gra&s;p, and comprehends the Waters in the Hollow of His Hand. Fleets and Navies, protected by Him, ride in Triumph upon the Face of the Deep. He &s;teers them in their trackle&s;s Cour&s;e, &s;wells their pro&s;perous Sails, and wafts them to the whi&s;h'd-for Haven. When He plea&s;es, he &s;catters them in His Wrath, and di&s;per&s;es them with the Breath of His Mouth. The Clouds gather and blacken, the Tempe&s;t rages, the loud Surges fome, and the foundering Ve&s;|&s;els &s;ink like Lead in the fathomle&s;s Profound, only broken upon the Shore in &s;hattered Frag|ments. He commands, "Peace, be Still;" the Winds and the Waters obey Him; &mdash; not a Breath of di&s;obedient Air ruffles the &s;erene Surface of the Flood.</P>
<P>'Tis He over-rules, when contending Squa|drons di&s;pute the Sovereignty of the Seas, and denounce Vengeance from the Mouth of their Cannon. He &s;its the irre&s;i&s;tible Umpire, weighs their different Preten&s;ions in his im|partial Ballance: He frowns and they are de|feated; and Victory attends His Smile.</P>
<P>Thus we have taken an imperfect Survey of the Infinite GOD, as He manages the Wheels of Providence, and determines the Fate of Na|tions; one Foot being upon the Sea, and the
<PB N="12" REF="008560_0010_102F82B41502A598">
other upon the dry Land. Should we not ac|knowledge His Supreme Authority; and fall pro&s;trate at His Foot&s;tool, in humble Adora|tion; when, like the Prophet, in captured Vi|&s;ion, we behold this Appearance of the Like|ne&s;s of the Glory of the LORD? Should we not unite in the &s;ublime A&s;cription of the P&s;alm|i&s;t? P&s;al. lxxxvi.8.&mdash; 10.
<Q>Among the Gods there is none like unto Thee, O LORD; nei|ther are there any Works like unto thy Works. All Nations whom Thou ha&s;t made, &s;hall come and wor&s;hip before Thee, O LORD; and &s;hall glorify thy Name. For Thou art Great, and do&s;t wondrous Things: Thou art GOD alone.</Q></P>
<P>Were our Nation, at this Day, in calami|tous Circum&s;tances, would it not be incumbent upon us, to humble our&s;elves under the mighty Hand of GOD, to deprecate the Divine Wrath, and implore the Smiles of His Countenance? And while we are ble&s;t with &s;o remarkable a Series of Pro&s;perity and Succe&s;s, while the Al|mighty &s;o wonderfully a&s;&s;erts our Cau&s;e, and our Enemies flee before us; while every Ex|pre&s;s that arrives from our Frontiers, and eve|ry Pacquet that cro&s;&s;es the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> adds a new Article to the joyful Tidings, and a fre&s;h Laurel to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Brows; it is equally our Duty to adore the Supream Benefactor, and comply with the Injunction of the Text;
<Q>Give unto the LORD, O ye Kindreds of the
<PB N="13" REF="008560_0011_102F82B831530B70">
People, give unto the LORD Glory and Strength. Give unto the LORD the Glory due unto His Name; bring an Offering, and come into his Courts.</Q></P>
<P>It is the Honor and the Happine&s;s of this much-favoured Nation, that we have a devout Monarch upon the Throne, who enjoins this Practice upon us by his Authority, and recom|mends it by his royal Example: and it is at his Call, by an expre&s;s Order from the Throne, that we now a&s;&s;embled together at this &s;olemn Fe&s;tival.</P>
<P>And now, what a Scene of Wonder opens to our View! Good GOD! what an a&s;toni&s;h|ing Scene of Wonders! Methinks, a univer|&s;al Tran&s;port animates every Countenance, &amp; &s;parkles in every Eye. Who can recount the innumerable Favours, be&s;towed upon our Na|tion and it's Allies, in the Year pa&s;t; that Year much to be remembred; that di&s;tingui&s;h|ed Year in the Annals of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>? Who is equal to the boundle&s;s Ta&s;k? What Tongue but falters, while the big Ideas crowd upon the Mind, and labor for Utterance? A few, out of the immen&s;e Multitude, the Time will &s;uffer me but ju&s;t to hint at.</P>
<P>The LORD of Ho&s;ts has wonderfully ap|peared in Vindication of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Cau&s;e, even our Enemies them&s;elves being Judges. He has &s;upported our illu&s;trious Ally, the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI>; a Name ever dear to tho&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="008560_0012_102F82BBF275A9E0">
who have the Cau&s;e of Religion and Liberty at Heart;&mdash; &s;upported him again&s;t one of the mo&s;t dangerous Confederacies, that could be formed by the Powers of Antichri&s;t; while the Arms of the <HI>Empire</HI> have been levelled again&s;t him, the turbulent Court of <HI>France</HI> have con&s;pired his Ruin, and the barbarous Troops of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> have thir&s;ted for his Blood. Expo&s;ed as he frequently has been, amid&s;t all the Tumult and Horrors of Battle; Thou|&s;ands falling at his Side and Ten Thou&s;ands at his right Hand; GOD has ever protected him, and for the mo&s;t Part, has crowned him with Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ervation of his Maje&s;ty's <HI>German</HI> Dominions; the Expul&s;ion of the <HI>French</HI> from the Electorate of <HI>Hanover</HI>; and the re|peated Succe&s;&s;es which have attended the glo|rious Prince <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> call al&s;o this Day for our Gratitude and Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>When we leave the&s;e foreign Pro&s;pects, and take a &s;hort Survey of tho&s;e which &s;till more nearly concern us; When we behold one of the be&s;t of Kings placed upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne, who has ever approved him|&s;elf the benevolent Father of his People; who ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;es his own Honor to con&s;i&s;t in the Freedom of his Subjects, and places his highe&s;t Happine&s;s in their Pro&s;perity; who de&s;pi&s;es the abject Submi&s;&s;ion of Slaves, while he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that are not dead

our Affairs wore a mo&s;t melancholly A&s;pect; and a univer&s;al Con&s;ternation appeared in every Countenance. You may remember the di&s;mal Sea&s;on, when, Year after Year, the ALMIGHTY frowned upon our Enterpri&s;es and Expediti|ons; and an in&s;ulting Enemy ravaged our Bor|ders. Our Fortre&s;&s;es were taken and demo|li&s;hed; our Troops intimidated and de&s;troyed, or carried Captive to a foreign Land: or, per|haps, they were overwhelmed with a ground|le&s;s Panic; perhaps, they &s;aw the Shadow of the Mountains as if they were Men, and mi&s;took Rocks for an Encampment;&mdash;the Sound of a &s;haken Leaf terrified them, and they fled when none pur&s;ued!

<Q>Give unto the LORD o ye Kindreds of the People, give unto the LORD Glory and Strength. Give unto the LORD the Glory due unto His Name; bring an Offering, and come into His Courts.</Q></P>
<P>And yet, the&s;e were but &s;mall Things in Thine Eyes, O our GOD; for we have &s;till a <HI>new Song</HI> to &s;ing, and the mo&s;t glorious In|&s;tance of Succe&s;s is yet unrelated. <Q>Shout, said <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI>
for the LORD hath given you the CITY!</Q>
The proud City of QUEBECK compleats our Conque&s;ts, and adds new Lu&s;|tre to the Important Year. This is, properly, &s;triking at the Foundation of the <HI>French</HI> Power in <HI>America.</HI> In our former Acqui&s;i|tions, we did, as it were, but lop the Branches: but, Thanks be to GOD! the Ax is now laid to the Root of the Tree. Happy would our pious Predece&s;&s;ors have been, could they have &s;een this di&s;tingui&s;hed Period: but it was de|nied them!&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed are our Eyes, for they be|hold it; and our Ears, for they hear the joy|ful Tidings!

to our Arms! When we con&s;ider how many fruitle&s;s Attempts have been made by us &amp; our Fathers, for the Reduction of this important Place; how immen&s;e the Blood and Trea&s;ure which have been expended, to no Purpo&s;e, in former Armaments; and the incon&s;iderable Number of Troops by which it was at la&s;t accompli&s;hed; it &s;hould aggrandi&s;e our Ideas of this glorious Action, as it will con&s;ecrate the memorable Name of WOLFE, to the late&s;t Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all our Rejoycing this Day, that gallant General demands a Tear, to be dropt upon his Funeral Urn;&mdash;that gallant General who, in the Bloom of Years, di&s;played &s;uch con&s;ummate military Skill; and expired &s;o bravely, in the Arms of Conque&s;t;
<Q>Great while he liv'd, but greater when he died.</Q>
But, my Brethren, we &s;hould reali&s;e the Voice of GOD in this Event.
<Q>Cea&s;e ye from Man, who&s;e Breath is in his No&s;trils, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</Q>
We &s;hould look beyond &s;econd Cau&s;es; and acknowledge that
<Q>there is <HI>none</HI> like unto the GOD of <HI>Je&s;urun,</HI> who has ridden in the Heaven, for our Help; and in His Excellency upon the Skies.</Q>

<P>And indeed, the Hand of GOD is con&s;pi|cuous in every Article of this Expedition. It was He who guided our Fleet thro' the diffi|cult Navigation of <HI>St. Lawrence</HI>; and pro|tected them in a violent Tempe&s;t, to which they were expo&s;ed &s;oon after their Arrival. It was He who enabled our Forces to make their Encampment, with &s;carce the Lo&s;s of a Man; who plentifully furni&s;hed them with the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life; who was the Health of their Countenance, and their GOD; and who pre&s;erved their &s;cattered Parties from the lurking Savages of the Wilderne&s;s. It was He who &s;upported them thro' all the Fa|tigues of a dangerous Campaign, and guarded them from the fatal Me&s;&s;engers of Death. It was He who infatuated the unhappy <HI>Mont|calm,</HI> to for&s;ake the Advantages of his Situa|tion, and ri&s;k a deci&s;ive Engagement. It was He who, in the Day of Battle, in&s;pired our Army with irre&s;i&s;tible Re&s;olution, and gave them the Victory over &s;uch &s;uperior Numbers. It was He who intimidated the vanqui&s;hed Enemy, and opened the Gates of the devoted City.</P>

Certainly, our Thank&s;giving, this Day, &s;hould be &s;omething more than an empty Form; an in&s;ignificant Compliance with Cu&s;tom&punc; Our Mirth &s;hould not be carnal and &s;en&s;ual: but we &s;hould rea|li&s;e that we are rea&s;onable Creatures, and Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the Name of JESUS.
